Welch , Chair Diverse intracellular pathogens subvert the host actin polymerization machinery to drive movement within and between cells during infection . Rickettsia in the spotted fever group ( SFG ) are Gram - negative , obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens that undergo actin - based motility and assemble distinctive ‘comet tails’ containing long , unbranched actin filaments . Despite this distinct organization , it was proposed that actin in Rickettsia comet tails was nucleated by the host Arp2 / 3 complex and the bacterial protein RickA , which assemble branched actin networks . To identify additional rickettisal proteins that might function in actin assembly , we searched translated Rickettsia genome databases for proteins with WASP homology 2 ( WH2 ) motifs , which are actin - binding peptides found in many cellular proteins . We identified WH2 motifs in Rickettsia Sca2 ( surface cell antigen 2 ) , a protein of the autotransporter family . Here , we demonstrate that R . parkeri Sca2 represents a new class of bacterial actin assembly factor that functionally mimics the eukaryotic formin family of actin nucleators . R . parkeri Sca2 nucleates unbranched actin filaments , processively associates with growing barbed ends , requires profilin for efficient elongation , and inhibits the activity of filament capping proteins , all properties shared with formins . Sca2 localizes to the R . parkeri surface , is enriched at the actin tail interface , and is sufficient to promote the assembly of long actin filaments in cytoplasmic extract . There is a strong correlation between the domain organization of Sca2 and the actin - based motility phenotype in diverse Rickettsia species . These results suggest that Sca2 mimics formins to determine the unique organization of actin filaments in Rickettsia tails and drive bacterial motility , independently of host nucleators . i TABLE OF CONTENTS Abstract . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 Table of contents . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . i List of figures . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ii List of abbreviations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . iii Acknowledgements . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . iv Chapter 1 : Using intracellular pathogens to investigate the eukaryotic cytoskeleton . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 Main Text . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 References . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19 Chapter 2 : Rickettsia parkeri Sca2 is a formin - like actin nucleation and elongation factor . . . . 27 Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 28 Results / Discussion . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 29 Materials and Methods . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 46 References . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 50 Chapter 3 : Future Directions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 54 Main Text . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 55 References . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 62 ii LIST OF FIGURES Figure 1 . 1 .

Thus , I needed the help of a great many people along the way . I am extremely grateful to ( in chronological order ) : My parents , who told me I could do anything and waited four decades to find out what ‘anything’ would be . My mother , a former biology teacher , drew the first Punnett Square my five - year - old self had seen to explain eye color distribution in our family . It took me thirty years to recognize what an impression that square had made on me . My dad , a seemingly tireless engineer , tackled household projects large and small with equal parts enthusiasm and efficiency ( plus a dash of perfectionism ) – this dissertation would have been completed sooner and more neatly if he’d been on the job . My sister Kim , who prompted the Punnett Square by wondering where her blue eyes had come from , was one step ahead of me then and continued to be so all along , but she graciously accepted me as an adult long before anyone else did ( and probably long before I deserved it ) . She went back to school in her thirties , proving to me that it was worth the trouble . I hope to repay the favor when we are old and gray by remaining one year less senile than she , so that I can help her record So You Think You Can Dance Season 47 . During the years when I wondered what to do with my life , Bill Hilliard was the ideal boss and helped give me the confidence to change my vocation . Abby Dernberg , Kathleen Ryan , Brandon Brown , and their card - playing buddies inspired me by talking about their science so passionately . UC Berkeley Extension instructor Barbara Bowman flipped a switch in my brain by describing hydrophilic molecules as “sparkly . ” I couldn’t have fulfilled chemistry and biology prerequisites without our amazing and underfunded community college system , in particular Contra Costa College . Microbiology professor Kate Levine is an inspiring whirlwind of bacterial knowledge ( some of it terrifying ) , and I heartily thank her and Caroline Kane for arranging summer internships at Cal for community college students . They placed me in the lab of Kris Niyogi , who was so supportive that I didn’t want to leave at the end of the summer . He eventually hired me as a research associate , which was incredibly kind given how little I understood the work in his lab at the time . All the Niyogi lab members were helpful , funny , and smart . Rachel Dent and Marilyn Kobayashi dished out particularly great guidance . Two years later , I stumbled semi - prepared into the MCB department . Huge thanks to Matt for accepting me first into the program , then into his lab , and for appearing to believe I could finish . I might not have , without his trademark combination of belief , prodding , and insistence on precision in writing and presenting , as well as his example of hard work and professionalism . My early experiments were mostly disasters , but when I finally found something that I felt sure about , Matt took the idea seriously and patiently supported my attempts to produce data . Such data might never have been obtained without the advice of Ken Campellone , who earned a dedicated entry in my protocol notebook ( titled “Ken’s Little Ways of Doing Everything Perfectly” ) ; Senior Rickettsiologists Robert Jeng and Alisa Serio and “Entry” - level Rickettsiologist Shawna Reed , who collectively eased the slow pain of Rickettsia work ; lab artist and archivist Taro Ohkawa , who captured the life behind the science ; and wise , supportive , and quotable labmates Erin Benanti , Julie Choe , Lee Douglas , Steve Duleh , Peter Hsiue , Elif Firat - Karalar and Haiming Wu , who provided Taro with large quantities of raw material . My dissertation committee of David Drubin , Dan Portnoy , and Kathleen Ryan were an annual source of good ideas and sage advice . Rebecca Heald and Karsten Weis were paragons of v professionalism every Monday morning during TriLab meeting , and Rebecca showed that this was not incompatible with cheerful dispensing of margaritas on Friday evenings . They and their lab members kindly provided advice , reagents , and camaraderie . Ted Hackstadt and Tina Clark at Rocky Mountain Laboratories have been extremely generous with strains , reagents , and friendly support . I am also deeply grateful to Dave Kovar and his lab for their enthusiasm for Sca2 , the scrupulous training they provided me , and the temporary monopoly on their equipment , all of which allowed me to collect more data in three days than I would have in three months at home . During those three days , Professor Chris “Serendipity” Lowe welcomed me into his home , cooked me oatmeal every morning , packed my lunches , and drove me to work , all apparently to repay a debt to my sister , which underscores how I couldn’t have finished this degree without my family . Much love and appreciation to all the Haglund and Hook kin — I hope that life after graduate school leaves me more time to visit you ! My friends have been unfailingly considerate and supportive and always seemed to forgive me when lab life interfered with our social life . Special giant shout - out to my best friend Katie Woodruff , who learned how to pronounce “Rickettsia” before anyone else in my life , and who managed to make me smile even during the times of highest stress . ( Before my qualifying exam , she sent me a ‘practice’ exam with questions such as : “True or false : For every cell full of actin , there is a cell full of equal and opposite reactin . Discuss . ” ) Katie also provided the most effective stress - relievers of all time in the form of her two adorable children Jamie and Tess , in whose world graduate school does not exist and the pinnacle of achievement is knowing how to make macaroni and cheese from a box . Last but certainly not least , my peerless husband Andy was there for me every single day . He drove across town countless times so that I wouldn’t have to take the bus home in the rain or late at night . He patiently waited through rough times when I worked late almost every evening , and thoughtfully installed motion - detector lights to make my homecomings easier . He tolerated years of living with a tired , cranky person and never seemed to flag in his support . He even learned to stop mentioning that his own Ph . D . took only three and a half years and hadn’t required him to teach any classes . I can’t possibly thank him enough ( but he says that finding a job and buying him a car would suffice ) . 1 CHAPTER 1 Using intracellular pathogens to investigate the eukaryotic cytoskeleton Note : The majority of this chapter will be included in the publication : Haglund , C . M . and Welch , M . D . ( 2011 ) Pathogens and polymers : microbe - host interactions illuminate the cytoskeleton . J Cell Biol . 2 Introduction Pathogenic microbes offer many advantages for elucidating cytoskeletal function and regulation . They exploit actin , microtubules , septins , and intermediate filaments in diverse ways . They also provide clear functional read - outs , such as infection efficiency or formation of distinct cytoskeletal structures . Finally , microbes often signal in a locally focused or exaggerated fashion , facilitating the dissection of pathways that might be more diffuse or moderate in the host . Pathogens have thus helped us assign function to cytoskeletal proteins , discover new modes of regulation , and unravel temporal and mechanistic interplay between factors involved in filament assembly . In this chapter , I discuss four infectious processes that have shed light on the host cytoskeleton . The first is pathogen invasion , which exploits cellular uptake pathways that rely on actin , such as phagocytosis and macropinocytosis . Emerging evidence suggests that microtubules and septins also play roles in distinct entry pathways . The second process is establishment of a replication niche , which subverts cytoskeletal functions that normally operate during membrane trafficking and cellular defense . Third , cytoplasmic actin - based motility mimics vesicle rocketing and has also illuminated host cell motility , while actin - based motility at the plasma membrane mimics the pathway responsible for kidney podocyte morphology and function . Finally , pathogen exit and cell - to - cell spread is an emerging field for which the endogenous processes are not clearly defined . I draw examples from three decades of cellular microbiology , focusing on recent developments in the field and on cases where pathogens ( mostly bacteria ) played particularly noteworthy roles in key discoveries . The pace of new findings suggests that the next three decades will be even more fruitful than the last . 3 Bacterial invasion of host cells : Many doors , many keys Entry pathways converge on actin polymerization Diverse bacteria invade non - phagocytic cells by stimulating endogenous uptake processes , such as phagocytosis and macropinocytosis . Actin polymerization is central to both of these processes , driving plasma membrane extensions that engulf external cargo . In addition to a shared reliance on actin , invading bacteria employ a multitude of upstream signaling molecules , and thus have contributed broadly to our understanding of actin regulation . Bacterial invasion pathways have historically been classified into two categories , “zipper” and “trigger” ( reviewed in Cossart and Sansonetti , 2004 ) . Zipper mechanisms , best studied for invasion of Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia spp . , occur when specialized bacterial surface proteins bind host cell receptors that signal across the membrane to a phagocytic pathway , which produces limited membrane rearrangement closely apposed to the entering bacterium ( Fig . 1 . 1a ) . In “trigger” mechanisms , exemplified by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ( Salmonella ) and Shigella flexneri , the pathogen injects effector proteins across the host membrane , often via the syringe - like type 3 secretion system ( T3SS ) , inducing a bloom of membrane ruffles that engulf the bacterium and other nearby particles ( Fig . 1 . 1b ) . Study of Salmonella entry established that actin - rich ruffles directly mediate macropinocytosis , a process in which extracellular cargo is taken up non - selectively , and that ruffles produced by endogenous mechanisms , such as by growth factors , have identical uptake behavior ( Francis et al . , 1993 ) . Another lesson learned from bacterial entry is the central importance of the Arp2 / 3 complex in plasma membrane remodeling . The Arp2 / 3 complex , when activated by nucleation promoting factors ( NPFs ) , nucleates branched actin networks . When this unique actin assembly activity occurs at the plasma membrane , it drives membrane extension , producing structures such as ruffles and phagocytic cups . All phagocytic pathways studied so far utilize the Arp2 / 3 complex . Even when a second actin nucleator has been implicated as well , as in the case of mDia1 during complement - mediated phagocytosis ( Colucci - Guyon et al . , 2005 ) , the Arp2 / 3 complex is also required ( May et al . , 2000 ) , suggesting that its activity is indispensable for particle engulfment processes . A plethora of injected effectors and host receptors employed by invasive bacteria converge on the Arp2 / 3 complex through Rho - family GTPases , which recruit and activate NPFs . Although the role of the Arp2 / 3 complex in phagocytosis has been well studied , recent work continues to impart new information about the pathways that regulate Arp2 / 3 complex in this process . For instance , when the contributions of the NPFs N - WASP and WAVE2 to Salmonella invasion were quantified , genetic deletion of N - WASP was found to double expression of a third Arp2 / 3 activator , WASH , in uninfected cells ( Hanisch et al . , 2010 ) . This suggests that WASH can partially compensate for the loss of N - WASP and is one of many examples of cytoskeletal plasticity . In the same study , WASH downregulation decreased Salmonella invasion , implicating WASH for the first time in the uptake of large particles . A more general lesson about actin polymerization is that it requires careful and vigilant modulation to maintain cell function and viability . Salmonella illustrates this point nicely , as it injects at least six effectors that control actin rearrangements during entry ( reviewed in Haraga et al . , 2008 ; McGhie et al . , 2009 ) . Various mechanisms of regulation are employed : two effectors activate Rho GTPases by mimicking host guanine - nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) ( Hardt et al . , 1998 ; Stender et al . , 2000 ) ; another activates GTPases indirectly , via inositol phosphatase 4 Figure 1 . 1 . Bacteria exploit actin and microtubules to promote invasion and adherence . ( a ) Zippering bacteria express an invasion protein on their surface , which binds to a host receptor and initiates phagocytosis . ( b ) Triggering bacteria inject protein effector ( s ) across the host cell membrane , usually via a T3SS , leading to macropinocytosis . ( c ) Clostridium CDT , a binary toxin , is endocytosed by intestinal epithelial cells , and the A subunit is released into the cytosol ( left panel ) . CDT toxin ADP - ribosylates actin , promoting actin filament disassembly , effacement of microvilli , and release of cortical proteins that normally capture and stabilize microtubules . Unrestrained microtubule growth produces cellular extensions that wrap around external bacteria . 5 activity ( Terebiznik et al . , 2002 ; Zhou et al . , 2001 ) ; and two effectors directly interact with actin , nucleating and stabilizing filaments near the entry site ( Hayward and Koronakis , 1999 ; Lilic et al . , 2003 ; McGhie et al . , 2004 ; Zhou et al . , 1999 ) . After a burst of polymerization , a sixth effector downregulates Rho - family proteins by promoting their GTPase activity , restoring normal actin structure at the cell cortex ( Fu and Galan , 1999 ) . The balance between Rho activation and inhibition is regulated both spatially ( Patel et al . , 2009 ) and temporally ( Kubori and Galan , 2003 ) . Thus , “triggered” entry is not a sudden event like the firing of a gun , but an elaborate , choreographed process . Disrupting this choreography can be detrimental to cell health . Is actin the only gatekeeper ? Although actin polymerization is critical for uptake processes , recent evidence suggests that other filament networks can also play important roles . The 1990s brought a few reports of microtubule - dependent bacterial invasion ; whether actin was also required in these cases was unsettled . Microtubule dependence in certain cell types was even reported for the well - studied Listeria ( Guzman et al . , 1995 ; Kuhn , 1998 ) and Salmonella ( Aiastui et al . , 2010 ) . A precise role for microtubules during entry was elusive , in part because the pathway ( s ) appeared to be cell type and strain specific ( Dhakal and Mulvey , 2009 ; Donnenberg et al . , 1990 ; Oelschlaeger et al . , 1993 ) . In the past few years , progress has been made towards defining a mechanistic basis for microtubule dependence during bacterial entry . Several toxins made by Clostridium spp . were found to induce the temporary formation of long , microtubule - filled projections that wrap around bacteria and promote adherence ( Schwan et al . , 2009 ) ( Fig . 1 . 1c ) . Although Clostridium do not enter cells , adherence is a prerequisite of invasion , so microtubule - based projections could promote the invasion of other pathogens . Interestingly , the toxins’ effect on microtubules is indirect : they ADP - ribosylate actin , leading to actin filament destruction , followed by release from the cell cortex of several proteins that normally capture and stabilize microtubules ( CLASP2 and ACF7 ) . For a few hours after toxin application , microtubule - based projections dominate the cell morphology , followed by cell shrinking and rounding . Actin depolymerizing drugs also induce microtubule - based projections , albeit at lower levels . The exaggerated effect produced by Clostridium toxins could provide a tool for dissecting the interplay between actin and microtubules at the cell periphery , particularly as it relates to microtubule capture . There is some evidence that intermediate filaments and septins might also contribute to bacterial entry . The intermediate filament vimentin has been implicated in the uptake of several bacteria , including Salmonella ( Murli et al . , 2001 ) and Escherichia coli K1 ( Chi et al . , 2010 ) . Depletion of septin - 2 reduced invasion efficiency of Listeria and Shigella , and several septins were observed to form a ring around invading bacteria ( Mostowy et al . , 2009 ) . For Listeria , the effect of septin depletion was specific to one of two receptor - mediated internalization pathways and , as with microtubules , varied with cell type , suggesting that discrete entry pathways are involved . Given that septin assembly in different cellular contexts can both influence and be influenced by the assembly of actin or microtubules ( reviewed in Gilden and Krummel , 2010 ; Spiliotis , 2010 ) , and that extensive crosstalk occurs between actin , microtubules , and intermediate filaments ( Chang and Goldman , 2004 ; Li and Gundersen , 2008 ; Rodriguez et al . , 2003 ) , it is likely that multiple signals pass between the four filament networks during bacterial entry , complicating the dissection of roles for each filament type . Further complications arise 6 from findings that blur distinctions between different entry pathways ; for instance , zippering bacteria such as Listeria exploit the clathrin - mediated endocytic machinery , which is classically associated with smaller cargo ( Veiga and Cossart , 2005 ; Veiga et al . , 2007 ) , while Salmonella can invade cells independently of ruffle formation ( Hanisch et al . , 2010 ; Stender et al . , 2000 ) . A systems biology approach , as proposed for viral entry ( Damm and Pelkmans , 2006 ) , could help untangle the pathways , and might clarify the variability across cell types . In this approach , RNAi knockdown of numerous host genes is combined with infection by a panel of pathogens to define “functional modules , ” or host genes that function together in a particular invasion process . A broad panel of bacteria could reveal the total number of separable entry pathways available in the host and define which cytoskeletal factors participate in each . Barring the door : extracellular pathogens disrupt actin to prevent phagocytosis In contrast to Salmonella , which dampens its effects on the cytoskeleton to maintain host cell viability , extracellular bacteria often treat cells more harshly . Many bacterial toxins covalently modify host cytoskeletal factors such as actin and Rho - family GTPases ( Visvikis et al . , 2010 ) , thus preventing uptake by phagocytic immune cells . Despite their destructiveness , these toxins’ modes of action pertain to endogenous processes . From them , new post - translational modifications and host signaling molecules have been identified . For instance , Rac , a member of the Rho family , was discovered as a substrate of the Clostridium botulinum C3 toxin ( Didsbury et al . , 1989 ) , and the toxin was instrumental in elucidating the roles of Rac and Rho as signaling hubs , with Rac controlling membrane ruffles ( Ridley et al . , 1992 ) and Rho controlling stress fibers and focal adhesions ( Ridley and Hall , 1992 ) . More recently , a novel eukaryotic regulatory mechanism , AMPylation , was discovered via the activity of a bacterial toxin . Vibrio parahaemolyticus VopS disrupts several Rho - family GTPases by covalent attachment of adenosine 5 ' - monophosphate ( AMP ) , abolishing downstream actin assembly ( Yarbrough et al . , 2009 ) . The catalytic domain , called Fic , was also found in eukaryotic proteins ( Kinch et al . , 2009 ; Worby et al . , 2009 ) . The Fic domain from human HYPE ( huntingtin yeast - interacting protein ) AMPylates Rho GTPases in vitro ( Worby et al . , 2009 ) , supporting the notion that AMPylation can serve as an endogenous form of Rho regulation . Another variation on Rho modification is employed by Photorhabdus luminescens , which ADP - ribosylates RhoA , preventing GTP hydrolysis and putting RhoA in a constitutively active state ( Lang et al . , 2010 ) . This differs from previously - characterized toxins from other pathogens that also ADP - ribosylate Rho proteins , because those toxins target a different residue and inhibit Rho function . A second Photorhabdus toxin ADP - ribosylates actin , preventing β - thymosin from sequestering actin monomers and leading to more extensive polymerization ( Lang et al . , 2010 ) . Again , the toxin targets a different residue and has the opposite effect on actin function compared to previously - studied toxins . Together , these two Photorhabdus toxins promote rampant , disruptive actin rearrangements and inhibit phagocytosis . Although the relevance of these forms of regulation to endogenous processes is not clear , it is interesting that phagocytosis can be blocked by both up - and down - regulating actin polymerization . This emphasizes the theme illustrated by Salmonella entry : actin polymerization must be carefully controlled to produce useful results , and excessive assembly can bring the network to a halt . 7 Constructing a niche Following invasion , many intracellular pathogens remain within the membrane - bound entry compartment , modifying it to suit their needs . This requires subversion of diverse host pathways to acquire resources for growth while manipulating phagosome maturation to prevent destruction within lysosomes . The cytoskeleton is exploited to maintain proper positioning of the pathogen - containing vacuole and to control membrane trafficking and vacuole maturation . Again Salmonella provides a useful example , as it expresses multiple effectors with overlapping and antagonistic effects ( reviewed in Bakowski et al . , 2008 ; McGhie et al . , 2009 ) . In this section , we briefly review how the study of Salmonella led to the identification of the kinesin interacting partner SKIP and to potential new roles for cytoskeletal motors in membrane trafficking . We then describe recent insights into IFs and septins , including possible roles in the regulation of autophagy , gleaned from the study of Chlamydia trachomatis , Shigella , and others . Salmonella regulates membrane trafficking via kinesin - 1 and SKIP Salmonella replicates in a perinuclear compartment called the Salmonella - containing vacuole ( SCV ) , from which membrane tubules called Sifs ( Salmonella - induced filaments ) extend . Integrity of the SCV was known to require microtubules , microtubule motors , and numerous bacterial effectors secreted by the T3SS , including SifA . A two - hybrid screen identified the primary interacting partner of SifA , a host protein of previously unknown function now called SKIP ( SifA and kinesin - interacting protein ) ( Boucrot et al . , 2005 ) . As the name suggests , SKIP interacts with kinesin - 1 in vitro and is required for SCV integrity . However , a role for kinesin in SCV integrity seemed paradoxical : kinesin was not detected on SCVs unless SKIP ( or SifA ) was depleted . Thus , it was proposed that SKIP negatively regulates the recruitment of kinesin . Shortly after the identification of SKIP , a different Salmonella effector , PipB2 , was shown to positively regulate kinesin - 1 recruitment to the SCV ( Henry et al . , 2006 ) . Why Salmonella would express both positive and negative regulators of kinesin recruitment was not immediately clear . A functional clue was provided by the discovery that at late time points after infection some SCVs moved toward the cell periphery as a prelude to dissemination , in a manner dependent on microtubules , kinesin - 1 , and PipB2 ( Szeto et al . , 2009 ) . At a mechanistic level , subsequent work showed that SKIP binds the late endosomal GTPase Rab9 , and that SifA might mimic Rab9 ( Jackson et al . , 2008 ) . SKIP promotes anterograde movement of late endosomes / lysosomes along microtubules ( Dumont et al . , 2010 ; Jackson et al . , 2008 ) , possibly through control of membrane tubulation ( Ohlson et al . , 2008 ) or scission events ( Dumont et al . , 2010 ) . SKIP might also contribute to Golgi apparatus positioning , because SKIP overexpression results in peripheral scattering of Golgi markers ( Dumont et al . , 2010 ) . A model for SCV maintenance was proposed in which inactive kinesin - 1 is recruited to SCV membranes by PipB2 , followed by formation of a complex containing kinesin , SKIP , and SifA ( Fig . 1 . 2 ) . SKIP could then activate kinesin by an unknown mechanism , possibly through its interaction with the kinesin light chain , promoting membrane scission and release of kinesin - positive vesicles ( Dumont et al . , 2010 ) . In this model , the lack of kinesin on SCVs is explained by its rapid dispersal on SCV - derived vesicles . The precise biochemical mechanism of SKIP and kinesin function on SCVs remains to be determined . It will be interesting to test this model and to see if an analogous mechanism operates on endogenous SKIP / Rab9 - positive compartments . 8 Figure 1 . 2 . Model for kinesin - 1 and SKIP activity on SCV membranes . The secreted Salmonella effectors PipB2 and SifA recruit kinesin - 1 and SKIP , respectively , to SCV membranes . It has been proposed that SKIP might then activate kinsein - 1 by binding to the kinesin light chain , and that SKIP : kinesin - 1 complexes promote tubulation and / or scission of SCV - derived membrane compartments , which are transported anterogradely along microtubules . 9 Another potentially interesting parallel between SCVs and endogenous compartments involves the actin - based motor myosin II , which was unexpectedly implicated in SCV positioning and integrity ( Wasylnka et al . , 2008 ) . Inhibition of myosin II resulted in SCV scattering , similar to the phenotype of SKIP overexpression , implying that myosin activity counteracts the anterograde pull of SKIP / kinesin . In uninfected cells , myosin II , together with Rab6 , directly contributes to vesicle fission from the Golgi apparatus ( Miserey - Lenkei et al . ) . By analogy , in Salmonella - infected cells , myosin II might promote the release of vesicles from the SCV , perhaps in cooperation with SKIP , kinesin - 1 and SifA . The involvement of both myosin II and kinesin - 1 in SCV - derived vesicle formation could point to new mechanisms of cooperation between actin - and microtubule - based motors . Filament “cages” : nest or trap ? Intermediate filaments ( IFs ) and actin also play roles in the establishment of replicative niches . In some cases , IFs , alone or with actin , form stabilizing cages around pathogen - containing vacuoles , apparently protecting them from host recognition . For example , Chlamydia trachomatis induces relocalization of the IFs vimentin , cytokeratin - 8 , and cytokeratin - 18 , as well as actin filaments to the Chlamydia inclusion membrane ( Kumar and Valdivia , 2008 ) . IF and actin assembly around the inclusion are interdependent , and disruption of either leads to release of bacteria into the cytoplasm , triggering host defense mechanisms . Chlamydia cages bear some resemblance to aggresomes , which are vimentin cages surrounding protein aggregates ( Wileman , 2007 ) , but aggresomes do not contain actin , are microtubule - dependent , and facilitate degradation of their contents via proteasomes and autophagy , whereas Chlamydia cages do not require microtubules and protect their contents . These cages appear to regulate IF filament assembly in a novel way : the bacterial protease CPAF locally cleaves IF head domains , reducing their cohesiveness but not displacing them from the inclusion , suggesting that controlled proteolysis might allow cage expansion while maintaining structural integrity of the inclusion . The head domain of vimentin is essential for filament assembly in vitro ( Herrmann et al . , 1996 ) , yet the IFs cleaved by CPAF assemble into higher molecular weight complexes in vitro , and the head domain remains associated with cages . Thus , proteolysis at an unidentified site in the head domain could represent a way to regulate the elasticity of IF networks . The authors proposed that Chlamydia cages are built in layers , with an unspecified bacterial T3SS effector recruiting RhoA to initiate actin assembly on the inclusion membrane , followed by the binding of unidentified linker proteins and an outer IF layer , which is progressively cleaved to permit expansion ( Kumar and Valdivia , 2008 ) . Many questions remain regarding IF cage structure and CPAF - mediated IF cleavage . Protective IF cages also coalesce around other intracellular bacteria . Salmonella vacuoles recruit the same three IF proteins as Chlamydia ( vimentin , cytokeratin - 8 , and cytokeratin - 18 ) , and IF disruption results in SCV dispersal ( Guignot and Servin , 2008 ) . Vimentin cages form around Anaplasma phagocytophilum inclusions , and a bacterial effector that binds vimentin and indirectly promotes survival was identified ( Sukumaran et al . , 2011 ) , supporting the hypothesis that caging is a protective , pathogen - controlled “nesting” process . Characterizing microbial effectors that mediate cage - building could provide additional information about IF regulation . In contrast , a distinct type of cage acts as a host - mediated trap that promotes destruction of the pathogen by autophagy . A proportion of cytosolic Shigella become wrapped in septin filaments , in a myosin II - dependent manner , concurrently with acquisition of markers of 10 autophagy ( Mostowy et al . , 2010 ) . Although initial cage assembly requires actin polymerization , an inverse correlation exists between the presence of a cage surrounding a bacterium and productive actin - based motility , and also between myosin activity and motility , indicating that a delicate balance of cytoskeletal forces determines the fate of each bacterium . Because septin cages initially require , but then antagonize actin polymerization , the authors looked for septins around other bacteria that undergo actin - based motility . Cages were detected around Mycobacterium marinum but not Listeria or Rickettsia conorii , suggesting that caging is influenced by bacterial factors , which could provide routes to understand its regulation . In any case , the connection between septin cages and autophagy points to a new cellular function for septins and merits further study . Given that a connection also exists between aggresome vimentin cages and autophagy , it is tempting to speculate that certain filament assemblies , such as septins or vimentin , simultaneously immobilize cytoplasmic contents and mark them for the autophagy machinery . If this is the case , then pathogens would be expected to evolve countermeasures to modify filament traps to avoid autophagy . For example , if vimentin acts as an autophagy signal , perhaps recruitment of additional IFs ( such as cytokeratins ) might serve to mask this signal . Intracellular pathogens , by serving as both targets and manipulators of the autophagy pathway , are invaluable tools for investigating its regulation . Tiny rocket scientists : Diverse pathogens “discovered” actin - based motility Some bacterial species escape from the phagocytic vacuole and replicate freely in the host cytoplasm . A subset of these pathogens express factors that trigger actin polymerization against their surface , producing mechanical force that propels them through the cell and facilitates spread to neighboring cells . This form of motility evolved independently in Listeria , Shigella , Rickettsia , and Burkholderia , and each of these genera use a distinct mechanism triggered by a single bacterial protein , demonstrating that , in contrast to vacuole positioning , actin - based motility ( ABM ) is relatively simple to achieve . Thus , it is not surprising that some viruses – vaccinia and other poxviruses ( Cudmore et al . , 1995 ; Dodding and Way , 2009 ) , and a baculovirus ( Ohkawa et al . , 2010 ) – have also evolved ABM , although poxviruses trigger it from outside of the cell . The study of pathogen ABM , particularly of Listeria , revolutionized our understanding of cellular actin - based propulsion , such as vesicle rocketing and lamellipodia - driven protrusion during cell migration . First , pathogen ABM enabled the identification of key players in these processes , and later it provided a tractable system to elucidate the activities of proteins involved in nucleation , crosslinking , and turnover of actin networks , as well as upstream signaling . We review discoveries that established the ABM field , and then highlight recent studies that shed new light on actin dynamics . Motility through the cytoplasm By the 1990s , it was well - established that actin polymerization was involved in the motility of eukaryotic cells , and it was inferred from the study of Listeria actin “comet tails” ( Tilney and Portnoy , 1989 ) that the motive force for lamellipodia protrusion during cell migration is derived from polymerization itself , rather than myosin activity along a cytoskeletal track ( Theriot et al . , 1992 ) . However , the cellular mechanisms of actin filament nucleation , organization , and disassembly in lamellipodia were unknown . The structure of comet tails produced by Listeria ActA or Shigella IcsA were highly similar to each other , suggesting that pathways controlling 11 Figure 1 . 3 . Pathogens employ distinct actin - based motility mechanisms . ( a ) The actin - based motility of Listeria and Rickettsia have distinct host protein requirements . Listeria expresses ActA on its surface , which activates the host Arp2 / 3 complex , producing branched actin filaments . Actin monomers or profilin : actin complexes can polymerize onto filament ends in Listeria tails . Rickettsia expresses the formin - like protein Sca2 on its surface , which nucleates unbranched actin filaments and requires profilin for filament elongation . T - plastin is also important for Rickettsia tail formation . Both systems require capping protein and cofilin . ( b ) Pathogens intercept actin assembly pathways at different levels . Vaccinia virus and EPEC mimic host phosphotyrosine motifs to recruit the adaptor protein Nck . Shigella and EHEC recruit and activate N - WASP . Listeria mimics N - WASP to activate the host Arp2 / 3 complex . Rickettsia bypasses host nucleators to interact directly with actin . 12 actin tail morphology and stability were controlled by the host . It was clear that identifying host binding partners of either ActA or IcsA would advance our understanding of cellular actin dynamics . The first binding partner identified was the Arp2 / 3 complex , a highly conserved seven - subunit complex that was found to be sufficient for actin assembly at the Listeria surface ( Welch et al . , 1997 ) . At the biochemical level , the Arp2 / 3 complex weakly promoted actin nucleation on its own and was strongly activated by the N - terminal domain of ActA ( Welch et al . , 1998 ) . Shigella also exploits Arp2 / 3 complex , but via a distinct mechanism : Shigella IcsA binds and activates host N - WASP to recruit Arp2 / 3 and actin ( Egile et al . , 1999 ) . The importance of Arp2 / 3 in cellular processes such as lamellipodia protrusion and phagocytosis was quickly recognized , and endogenous proteins such as WASP / N - WASP and WAVE were shown to activate Arp2 / 3 complex in the same manner as ActA ( reviewed in Goley and Welch , 2006 ) . Collectively , these Arp2 / 3 activators became known as nucleation - promoting factors ( NPFs ) . Additional NPFs , such as WHAMM , WASH , and JMY , continue to be identified and characterized , uncovering new roles for the Arp2 / 3 complex in processes such as ER - to - Golgi transport and endosome trafficking ( Rottner et al . , 2010 ) . Recapitulating Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated motility in a defined system of purified components was achieved by recognizing that nucleation is not the only activity required for productive ABM . Sustained movement was achieved using the following components : Listeria , or Escherichia coli expressing IcsA and coated with N - WASP ; Arp2 / 3 complex to nucleate filaments ; actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF , also known as cofilin ) to accelerate depolymerization to maintain the actin monomer pool ; and capping protein to prevent non - productive growth of filaments away from the bacterial surface ( Loisel et al . , 1999 ) ( Fig . 1 . 3a ) . Profilin , which binds actin monomers and enhances depolymerization from pointed ends , increased the rate of movement but was not strictly required . This landmark study laid the foundation for elucidating the chemical and physical bases of force production by actin assembly , which directly informs the cellular process of vesicle rocketing ( Marchand et al . , 1995 ; Merrifield et al . , 1999 ; Taunton et al . , 2000 ) . Moreover , the Arp2 / 3 complex nucleation machinery and the signaling molecules involved in ABM are substantially similar to those driving the protrusion of cellular lamellipodia and pseudopodia , although these structures differ from rocketing particles in size and shape ( Borisy and Svitkina , 2000 ; Bugyi et al . , 2008 ; Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) . Reconstitution of motility also provides a tractable system to dissect the activities of other proteins that regulate actin dynamics . To list just a few examples , it has been used to demonstrate filament capping by twinfilin ( Helfer et al . , 2006 ) , severing by villin ( Revenu et al . , 2007 ) , and enhancement of the N - WASP / Arp2 / 3 interaction by the adaptor protein Grb2 ( Carlier et al . , 2000 ) . There is still more to learn from pathogens moving through cytoplasm . Twenty - two years after Tilney’s micrographs of Listeria ABM , the biophysical mechanisms of its propulsion are still being debated and tested ( reviewed in Dickinson , 2009 ; Mogilner , 2006 ) . Furthermore , alternative mechanisms of ABM have recently been discovered . Rickettsia is the first pathogen found to bypass the Arp2 / 3 complex for ABM ( Serio et al . , 2010 ) , instead encoding its own formin - like nucleator ( Haglund et al . , 2010 ) . This type of motility requires a different set of host factors compared to Listeria and Shigella ( Fig . 1 . 3a ) . Specifically , profilin and the actin bundling protein T - plastin ( fimbrin ) are critical for Rickettsia ABM ( Serio et al . , 2010 ) . Rickettsia may subvert an endogenous motility pathway driven by formins , as host formins mediate movements 13 such as the translocation of oocyte chromosomes towards the cortex during meiosis I ( Li et al . , 2008 ) , and might also play a role in ER positioning in somatic cells ( Chhabra et al . , 2009 ) . Whether Rickettsia ABM will prove useful in understanding the movements of these or other cellular cargoes remains to be determined . Motility across the membrane A distinct “surfing” form of ABM is employed by extracellular vaccinia virus and pathogenic strains of E . coli , which intercept receptor tyrosine - kinase signaling pathways , resulting in the formation of a moving , actin - rich pedestal beneath the pathogen . Each of these divergent microbes encodes a transmembrane protein that becomes phosphorylated by Src - and Abl - family kinases , leading to recruitment of the adaptor proteins Nck1 and Nck2 , which activate N - WASP to stimulate Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization ( Campellone , 2010 ; Frischknecht et al . , 1999 ) ( Fig . 1 . 3b ) . Studies of vaccinia and enteropathogenic E . coli ( EPEC ) demonstrated the physiological relevance of the phosphotyrosine / Nck / N - WASP pathway for signaling to actin assembly . Following its elucidation , this pathway was found to be essential in kidney podocytes , signaling through the host receptor nephrin to produce the actin - rich cellular extensions that are critical for kidney filtration function ( Jones et al . , 2006 ) . In fact , the phoshotyrosine motifs from EPEC can functionally replace those of nephrin ( Blasutig et al . , 2008 ) . Stimulated T cell antigen receptors ( TCRs ) also induce actin polymerization by recruiting Nck , although the pathway employs WASP instead of N - WASP ( Barda - Saad et al . , 2005 ) . Nck also signals to actin downstream of other receptor tyrosine kinases , including neuronal axon guidance receptors such as Ephrin A4 ( Fawcett et al . , 2007 ) and growth factor receptors such as PDGF - R ( Rivera et al . , 2006 ; Ruusala et al . , 2008 ) , although the downstream pathways and potential roles of Nck in axon guidance or growth factor signaling are not clearly defined . Nonetheless , pathogen signaling through Nck / N - WASP is relevant to several endogenous processes . One recent advance derived from the study of these pathogens is the dynamic interplay between Arp2 / 3 , NPFs , and their regulatory partners . A recent report used vaccinia virus to examine the recruitment and turnover of Nck , N - WASP , WASP interacting protein ( WIP ) , and the adaptor protein Grb2 during actin assembly ( Weisswange et al . , 2009 ) . Surprisingly , although Nck and WIP are thought to recruit N - WASP , the turnover rate for N - WASP was much slower than for Nck and WIP , implying that other interactions stabilize N - WASP in vaccinia tails . N - WASP stabilization activity was attributed to Grb2 and , more importantly , to the Arp2 / 3 complex . In fact , N - WASP did not turn over when its ability to stimulate Arp2 / 3 - mediated nucleation was disrupted , suggesting that interaction with the Arp2 / 3 complex is required to dissociate N - WASP from its binding partners on the surface of the motile particle . Presumably , this requirement applies to N - WASP - mediated nucleation on rocketing vesicles as well , and possibly to Arp2 / 3 activation by other NPFs , although this remains to be tested . These molecular interactions have implications at the level of virus motility . The rate of N - WASP exchange correlated positively with the rate of virus motility , but inversely with the number of tails , illustrating the need to balance speed with stability to achieve productive motility . The vaccinia system is well - suited to future studies of the dynamic interactions within actin nucleation complexes . Recent work with EPEC has shed light on membrane phosphoinosotide signals regulating actin assembly . The EPEC protein that recruits Nck , called Tir , also binds host phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3K ; ( Sason et al . , 2009 ; Selbach et al . , 2009 ) and the inositol - 5 - phosphatase SHIP2 14 ( Smith et al . , 2010 ) . The combined activities of these two enzymes can convert PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , the predominant membrane phosophoinositide in stable wild - type pedestals . When SHIP2 recruitment is prevented , PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 accumulates instead , and bacteria are associated with multiple , aberrantly long pedestals ( Smith et al . , 2010 ) , suggesting that PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 is required to downregulate signaling after an initial burst of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - enhanced actin polymerization . The lipid requirements for EPEC pedestal formation might have parallels to endogenous processes . The motif in Tir that recruits SHIP2 is homologous to host immunoreceptor tyrosine - based inhibitory motifs ( ITIMs ) , which also recruit SHIP2 - like phosphatases to downregulate signaling from TCRs and other receptors . Conversely , PI3K is recruited during T cell activation ( Smith - Garvin et al . , 2009 ) and also during nephrin - mediated actin reorganization ( Huber et al . , 2003 ; Zhu et al . , 2008 ) . Because EPEC pedestals provide a clear read - out of the extent of actin assembly , they could be useful for investigating the mechanisms by which PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 downregulates actin assembly . Enterohemorrhagic E . coli ( EHEC ) , while closely related to EPEC , has evolved a distinct mechanism of pedestal formation that has shed light on N - WASP regulation . Instead of recruiting Nck , EHEC Tir recruits the bacterial effector EspF U , which contains 2 - 6 repeated sequences that directly bind to and activate N - WASP . Dissection of EspF U demonstrated the critical role of multivalency in N - WASP activation , as the repeated EspF U peptides are efficient activators only when they can recruit multiple copies of N - WASP ( Sallee et al . , 2008 ) . In contrast , isolated EspF U repeats can bind N - WASP , but do not promote robust actin polymerization ( Campellone et al . , 2008 ; Sallee et al . , 2008 ) . The importance of oligomerization as a universal mode of NPF regulation is supported by in vitro work showing that dimerized NPF activation domains have ~ 100x greater affinity for ( Padrick et al . , 2008 ) and activity towards the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Higgs and Pollard , 2000 ; Padrick et al . , 2008 ) compared to monomeric NPFs . Oligomerization could also explain results in uninfected cells in which artificial clustering of WASP or an upstream binding partner at the plasma membrane stimulated downstream actin polymerization ( Castellano et al . , 1999 ; Rivera et al . , 2004 ) . As with cytoplasmic ABM , more remains to be learned from pathogen motility on the plasma membrane . For instance , even the relatively well - studied molecule EPEC Tir contains peptides whose effects on actin pedestals are not understood ( reviewed in Campellone , 2010 ) . Intriguingly , both EPEC and host nephrin employ secondary mechanisms of actin assembly in addition to the primary phosphotyrosine - and Nck - dependent pathway , leaving the possibility that additional parallels exist between the two systems . Finally , EHEC EspF U can be used to explore how cells generate plasma membrane protrusions independent of tyrosine kinase signaling . Continued study of pathogens that promote ABM across membranes will shed light on signal transduction pathways and actin assembly mechanisms at the cell boundary . New directions : Pathogen exit and dissemination Pathogens can quickly consume a host cell’s resources and must spread to new cells to continue their life cycle . Although spread can follow host cell lysis , it is often advantageous for a microorganism to exit cells in a controlled , non - lytic manner . Far less is known about molecular mechanisms of dissemination compared to entry or intracellular movement , but several exit modes – protrusion - mediated spread , extrusion of a vacuole , and non - lytic ejection – have been shown to utilize the actin cytoskeleton ( Fig . 1 . 4 ) . It is likely that normal host cell processes are 15 Figure 1 . 4 . Exit strategies of diverse intracellular pathogens use actin . Chlamydia ( orange ) vacuoles are extruded through a cortical constriction , and the plasma membrane seals around the constriction point in an actin - dependent manner , releasing a double - membrane - bound bacterial compartment . Listeria ( green ) and Shigella , propelled by actin - based motility , enter plasma membrane protrusions and are taken up by neighboring cells . Mycobacterium ( purple ) exits cells through a plasma membrane break surrounded by a barrel - shaped ejectosome rich in actin , myosin 1B , and coronin . Cryptococcus ( blue ) phagosomes fuse with the plasma membrane , and intermittent actin polymerization around the phagosome inhibits this fusion . 16 exploited during exit , as during entry and intracellular motility , but these processes are poorly defined . This makes pathogen exit an exciting area for future research . Bacteria that undergo ABM , such as Listeria and Shigella , subsequently enter long , plasma - membrane - bound protrusions from infected cells into adjacent cells ( Kadurugamuwa et al . , 1991 ; Tilney and Portnoy , 1989 ) , and , about 40 minutes later , escape into the neighboring cell’s cytoplasm ( Monack and Theriot , 2001 ; Robbins et al . , 1999 ) . Within protrusions , actin tail morphology changes : filaments become longer and more densely bundled ( Gouin et al . , 1999 ; Sechi et al . , 1997 ) and more stable ( Robbins et al . , 1999 ) . The first host factors implicated in protrusion - mediated spread were adherens junction proteins . Vinculin localized to Shigella protrusions ( Kadurugamuwa et al . , 1991 ) , and cadherins contributed to protrusion formation in a manner beyond their role in cell - cell adhesion ( Sansonetti et al . , 1994 ) . Because cadherin cytoplasmic domains link to actin filaments via vinculin and other junction components , it was speculated that junction proteins might bind actin comet tails , inducing changes to actin filament organization that promote the formation and rigidity of protrusions . Analogously , disruption of ezrin , an actin - membrane linker that localizes to Listeria protrusions but not cytoplasmic tails , results in short , crumpled protrusions ( Pust et al . , 2005 ) . In contrast , the junction protein Tuba , which has N - WASP binding , scaffolding , and GEF activity , negatively regulates protrusion formation ( Rajabian et al . , 2009 ) , apparently by promoting cortical tension in epithelial cell layers ( Otani et al . , 2006 ; Rajabian et al . , 2009 ) . Listeria has evolved an effector , InlC , that interferes with Tuba : N - WASP binding , relaxing cortical tension and promoting protrusions . Thus , protrusion formation appears to require an initial relaxation of cortical rigidity , followed by promotion of rigidity , presumably by a different set of factors , around the bacterial actin tail . Listeria protrusions could serve as a useful , easily - studied structure to characterize host proteins involved in the maintenance of cortical tension . Recently , the formin - family actin nucleators Dia1 and Dia2 were found to support spreading of Shigella ( Heindl et al . , 2010 ) . As with ezrin , Dia1 and Dia2 localize to actin in protrusions but not to cytoplasmic tails , and disruption of Dia function reduces the frequency and length of protrusions . The involvement of formins , which generate long , unbranched actin filaments , is consistent with the parallel filament bundles found in protrusions . Together , the effects of formins , ezrin , vinculin and cadherin on protrusions but not cytoplasmic tails suggest that a distinct set of actin regulatory factors interacts with motile bacteria after they contact the plasma membrane . More work is required to determine which cellular factors help build protrusions , the order in which they act , and how the transition is regulated . Moreover , how these cytoskeletal alterations promote uptake by neighboring cells is unclear . In uninfected cells , uptake of vesicles derived from neighboring cells has been observed and was named paracytophagy ( Robbins et al . , 1999 ) . Paracytophagy’s role in cells has not been described , but it is possible that study of protrusion - mediated spread could provide clues to the conditions under which it occurs . Another actin - dependent mode of exit is the extrusion of Chlamydia - filled inclusions into the extracellular space ( Hybiske and Stephens , 2007 ) . Compartments containing a few to hundreds of Chlamydia , surrounded by both inclusion and host plasma membranes , were observed to balloon out from a constriction point in the host cell over the course of several hours , eventually being released into the media . The process requires actin , N - WASP , and myosin II , and the final pinching - off step requires the GTPase Rho . Chlamydia have a second , lytic exit strategy , and usually both mechanisms are employed with equal frequency . Curiously , the 17 authors found that jasplakinolide , which prevents actin depolymerization but not polymerization , abrogated the lytic strategy and quickly induced extrusions , even early in infection when Chlamydia do not normally exit . This suggests that robust actin polymerization alone is sufficient to induce extrusion , which implies that it is a host - driven process . However , the endogenous function of extrusion , if any , remains a mystery . A third actin - dependent mode of exit was recently described for Mycobacterium marinum and M . tuberculosis ( Hagedorn et al . , 2009 ) . These bacteria , which spend part of their life cycle free in the host cytoplasm , were observed exiting host amoebae through a barrel - shaped structure rich in actin , myosin 1B , and coronin , which the authors called an ejectosome . The ejection process occurred without long membrane extensions , did not require a comet tail or a recipient cell , and took only a few minutes to complete , distinguishing it from protrusion - mediated spread and extrusion . Ejection resulted in direct breakage of the plasma membrane and exit into either the media or an adjacent cell , which formed a phagocytic - cup - like structure around the invading bacterium . In spite of membrane rupture , leakage of cellular contents did not occur , apparently due to a tight septum formed by the actin ring . The authors proposed that ejectosomes might have originated as a mechanism for plasma membrane resealing . Actin polymerization and actomyosin contraction occur around plasma membrane wounds ( Mandato and Bement , 2001 ) , but this process employs myosin 2 ( Mandato and Bement , 2001 ; Togo and Steinhardt , 2004 ) , whereas myosin 2 was not detected at ejectosomes . Thus , the connection between ejectosomes and plasma membrane repair pathways requires further investigation . A membrane - sealing function might also explain the cycles of transient actin polymerization observed around phagosomes containing the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans ( Johnston and May , 2010 ) or bacteria such as Listeria ( Yam and Theriot , 2004 ) . In the case of Cryptococcus , actin “flashes” follow phagosome permeabilization events , in an Arp2 / 3 - complex - and WASP / N - WASP - dependent manner . Cryptococcus exits cells by phagosomal fusion with the plasma membrane , and fusion is usually preceded by phagosome permeabilization . In contrast to the above exit strategies , fungal exit is enhanced when actin polymerization is disrupted , implying that host cells use actin polymerization to limit dissemination . Flashes were also observed on phagosomes containing transferrin - coated beads , on mechanically - induced plasma membrane wounds , and at membrane invaginations around particles too large to phagocytose ( Yam and Theriot , 2004 ) , demonstrating that flashing is an endogenous process , induced by membrane breakage and possibly by the presence of large internalized particles . Although dynamic actin accumulates around plasma membrane wounds , the role of actin polymerization on phagosomes is less clear . Actin might contribute to phagosomal membrane repair , or could form a barrier to limit mixing of vesicle contents with cytosol while other repair mechanisms occur . In either case , actin polymerization appears to help maintain the integrity of phagosomes . Collectively , these reports will certainly lead to further discoveries about the role of actin in ushering pathogens or other particles out of cells , including insights into membrane resealing . As mentioned above , the endogenous pathways exploited during pathogen exit are not defined , and it is currently unknown if other cytoskeletal structures are involved in these processes . Future Perspectives Given the numerous ways in which pathogens have contributed to our understanding of the cytoskeleton , it is obvious that future study of pathogen - cytoskeleton interactions will uncover 18 important new insights . In particular , pathogens might reveal key clues about the role ( s ) of actin in the nucleus , an area that is just beginning to be explored ( Skarp and Vartiainen , 2010 ) . For instance , baculovirus replication requires nuclear translocation and polymerization of actin ( Goley et al . , 2006 ) . Furthermore , Anaplasma phagocytophilum induces phosphorylation of actin in its host , leading to increased nuclear G - actin and phospho - actin - dependent upregulation of a host gene required for bacterial survival ( Sultana et al . , 2010 ) . These microbes might serve as useful probes for the study of nuclear actin . Pathogens also have additional tricks up their sleeves that were not discussed here , such as destabilization ( Coureuil et al . , 2009 ) or reinforcement ( Kim et al . , 2009 ) of intercellular junctions , as well as promotion of host cell motility ( Worley et al . , 2006 ) , suggesting insights into these processes will be forthcoming . Advancements will also come from technological improvements , for example in imaging methods , as well as new approaches , such as systems - level analyses and mathematical modeling . In addition to revealing fundamental cellular mechanisms , future studies of the host - pathogen relationship will enhance our understanding of pathogenesis and disease , and may lead to improved diagnostics and treatments for microbial infections . 19 References Aiastui , A . , M .

M . , J . E . Choe , C . T . Skau , D . R . Kovar , and M . D . Welch . 2010 . Rickettsia Sca2 is a bacterial formin - like mediator of actin - based motility . Nat Cell Biol . 12 : 1057 - 63 . 28 Introduction Diverse intracellular pathogens subvert the host actin polymerization machinery to drive movement within and between cells during infection . Rickettsia in the spotted fever group ( SFG ) are Gram - negative , obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens that undergo actin - based motility and assemble distinctive comet tails consisting of long , unbranched actin filaments ( Gouin et al . , 1999 ; Van Kirk et al . , 2000 ) . Despite this distinct organization , it was proposed that actin in Rickettsia comet tails was nucleated by the host Arp2 / 3 complex and the bacterial protein RickA , which assemble branched actin networks ( Gouin et al . , 1999 ; Jeng et al . , 2004 ) . However , a second bacterial gene , sca2 , was recently implicated in actin tail formation by R . rickettsii ( Kleba et al . , 2010 ) . In this chapter , we demonstrate that Sca2 represents a new class of bacterial actin assembly factor that functionally mimics eukaryotic formin proteins . Sca2 nucleates unbranched actin filaments , processively associates with growing barbed ends , requires profilin for efficient elongation , and inhibits the activity of capping protein , all properties shared with formins . Sca2 localizes to the Rickettsia surface and is sufficient to promote the assembly of actin filaments in cytoplasmic extract . These results suggest that Sca2 mimics formins to determine the unique organization of actin filaments in Rickettsia tails and drive bacterial motility , independently of host nucleators . The geometry of actin filaments in eukaryotic cells is specified by nucleation and elongation factors . These include the Arp2 / 3 complex together with its nucleation - promoting factors ( NPFs ) that assemble branched networks , and formins and tandem - monomer - binding proteins that assemble unbranched filaments ( Campellone and Welch , 2010 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex is essential for the motility of diverse microbial pathogens , including Listeria monocytogenes , Shigella flexneri , and vaccinia virus , which each express a factor that mimics or recruits host NPFs ( Gouin et al . , 2005 ) . These pathogens have been useful tools for investigating the assembly of branched actin arrays , such as those in cellular lamellipodia . Although many Rickettsia species express the NPF RickA ( Gouin et al . , 2004 ; Jeng et al . , 2004 ) , the failure to observe Arp2 / 3 complex subunits in Rickettsia comet tails ( Gouin et al . , 1999 ; Harlander et al . , 2003 ; Heinzen , 2003 ; Serio et al . , 2010 ) , the ability of Rickettsia to undergo motility in cells in which Arp2 / 3 is inhibited ( Harlander et al . , 2003 ; Heinzen , 2003 ; Serio et al . , 2010 ) , and the unbranched organization of Rickettsia tails point to an Arp2 / 3 - independent polymerization mechanism . Other bacterial pathogens express tandem - monomer - binding nucleators , including VopF from Vibrio cholerae ( Tam et al . , 2007 ) , VopL from Vibrio parahaemolyticus ( Liverman et al . , 2007 ) , and TARP from Chlamydia trachomatis ( Jewett et al . , 2006 ; Jewett et al . , 2010 ) . However , these secreted effectors are not implicated in actin - based motility . Because SFG Rickettsia assemble distinctive parallel actin filament arrays to drive motility , they could be a model for investigating the forces that such arrays impart on intracellular cargo , or for studying actin assembly pathways in cellular structures such as filopodia and microvilli . 29 Results and Discussion To identify bacterial factors that contribute to actin nucleation , we searched translated Rickettsia genome databases for proteins with WASP homology 2 ( WH2 ) motifs , which are actin - binding peptides in NPFs , some formins , and tandem - monomer - binding nucleators ( Campellone and Welch , 2010 ) . We identified WH2 motifs in Rickettsia Sca2 ( surface cell antigen 2 ) , a protein that was recently implicated in R . conorii invasion of mammalian cells ( Cardwell and Martinez , 2009 ) and , importantly , in R . rickettsii actin tail formation and virulence ( Kleba et al . , 2010 ) . Sca2 has a conserved autotransporter domain , predicted to anchor it in the outer membrane , and a large passenger domain , predicted to be exposed on the bacterial surface ( Ngwamidiba et al . , 2005 ) ( Fig . 2 . 1a ) . In R . parkeri , a representative SFG species , Sca2 contains a central cluster of three putative WH2 motifs , reminiscent of tandem - monomer - binding nucleators ( Fig . 2 . 1a , b ; these putative WH2 motifs differ from those proposed by Kleba et al . ( Kleba et al . , 2010 ) . This WH2 cluster is flanked by two proline - rich domains ( PRDs ) that are predicted to interact with the actin monomer - binding protein profilin ( Holt and Koffer , 2001 ) , similar to formin homology 1 ( FH1 ) domains of formins ( Fig . 2 . 1c ) . Thus , Sca2 shares sequence motifs with both formins and tandem - monomer - binding nucleators . We therefore investigated whether purified recombinant R . parkeri Sca2 passenger domain ( GST - Sca2 ) affected the assembly kinetics of pyrene - labeled actin in vitro . In this assay , Sca2 passenger domain exhibited dose - dependent nucleation activity ( Fig . 2 . 2a , b ) , eliminating the lag phase of polymerization ( Fig . 2 . 2a , left panel ) . Similar kinetics were observed using Sca2 lacking the GST tag ( not shown ) . The intrinsic nucleating activity of Sca2 distinguishes it from RickA , which requires host Arp2 / 3 complex to nucleate actin ( Gouin et al . , 2004 ; Jeng et al . , 2004 ) . The combination of purified Sca2 and RickA assembled actin with the same kinetics as Sca2 alone ( Fig . 2 . 2c ) , indicating that RickA does not affect nucleation by Sca2 . To map the domains in Sca2 responsible for nucleation , we tested the activity of truncated Sca2 derivatives ( Fig . 2 . 1a ) . A fragment containing the N - terminus , WH2 cluster , and PRDs ( GST - Sca2 - 1106 ) nucleated actin assembly ( Fig . 2 . 2d ) . However , it was less potent than GST - Sca2 and lost activity at salt concentrations above 50 mM , suggesting that the missing repetitive sequences are necessary for optimal activity . The Sca2 N - terminal domain ( GST - Sca2 - 670 ) also displayed weak nucleation activity , with slightly different assembly kinetics compared to GST - Sca2 - N1106 ( Fig . 2 . 2e ) . In contrast , a derivative containing only the putative WH2 cluster and PRDs ( GST - Sca2 - 646 - 1106 ) caused dose - dependent inhibition of polymerization ( Fig . 2 . 2f ) . Potent inhibition required concentrations approaching that of actin , suggesting that it bound and sequestered actin monomers . The failure of the WH2 cluster to nucleate actin implies that Sca2 does not belong to the tandem - monomer - binding class of nucleators , distinguishing it from VopF , VopL , and TARP . Collectively , these results indicate that efficient actin nucleation requires the N - terminal domain , WH2 cluster , and PRDs . Two features of the bulk polymerization kinetics in the presence of GST - Sca2 and GST - Sca2 - 1106 suggested that Sca2 might affect actin assembly at fast - growing barbed ends , a property of formins . First , reactions containing low concentrations of Sca2 reached steady state more slowly than reactions lacking Sca2 . Second , all concentrations of Sca2 lowered the steady - state level of actin polymer , suggesting that Sca2 raises the critical concentration for actin assembly ( Cc ) . We measured the effect of Sca2 on the Cc by polymerizing actin overnight in the presence of a range of GST - Sca2 concentrations ( Fig . 2 . 3a ) . Saturating concentrations of GST - Sca2 raised the Cc of actin to 0 . 7 µM , approximately that of pointed ends , suggesting that Sca2 30 Figure 2 . 1 .

( h ) Dependence of the initial elongation rate on the concentration of profilin , in the presence of 20 nM GST - Sca2 . ( i ) Elongation of filament seeds in the presence of CapZ ( 10 nM ) or CapZ and GST - Sca2 ( 12 nM ) . All reactions included profilin ( 1 µM ) . 33 significantly inhibits barbed - end dynamics . To test this , we monitored pyrene - actin assembly from filament seeds at a monomer concentration below the Cc for pointed ends . Under these conditions , low nanomolar amounts of Sca2 inhibited barbed - end elongation in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 2 . 3b , c ) . Sca2 also slowed the depolymerization of preformed actin filaments ( Fig . 2 . 3d ) . The K d of Sca2 for barbed ends , derived from its inhibition of barbed - end assembly , was 1 . 5 nM . Thus , Sca2 binds barbed ends with high affinity , a conserved property of formins ( Chesarone et al . , 2010 ) . Sca2 behaves like the Schizosaccharomyces pombe formin Cdc12p ( Kovar et al . , 2003 ; Skau et al . , 2009 ) , the Drosophila melanogaster formin DAAM ( Barko et al . , 2010 ) , and the mammalian formin mDia2 ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ) , which dramatically slow barbed - end elongation in the absence of profilin . Because profilin enables elongation by these formins ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ; Romero et al . , 2004 ) and Sca2 contains predicted profilin binding sites in its PRDs , we tested whether human platelet profilin could accelerate barbed - end elongation in the presence of Sca2 . We first measured the lengths of filaments nucleated by GST - Sca2 prior to the reaction reaching steady state ( Fig . 2 . 3e , f ) . Control reactions containing actin alone produced filaments with a median length of 8 . 0 µm . In contrast , filaments nucleated by GST - Sca2 had a median length of only 0 . 6 µm ( p < 0 . 001 , Kruskal - Wallis test ) . When profilin and Sca2 were both included , the length of filaments was increased to a median of 5 . 7 µm . The filaments polymerized by Sca2 and profilin were unbranched , like filaments in Rickettsia comet tails . To confirm that profilin stimulated elongation at barbed ends , we monitored pyrene - actin assembly from filament seeds at a monomer concentration below the Cc for pointed ends ( Fig . 2 . 3g ) . Inclusion of profilin with GST - Sca2 significantly accelerated elongation , although the rate was slower than with actin and profilin alone , suggesting that Sca2 remains bound to polymerizing barbed ends in the presence of profilin . The effect of profilin was dose - dependent and saturated at a 1 : 1 profilin : actin ratio ( Fig . 2 . 3h ) , consistent with the idea that Sca2 assembles profilin - actin complexes more efficiently than actin alone . Thus , Sca2 behaves like formins as a profilin - dependent barbed - end elongation factor . By associating with barbed ends , formins can compete with capping proteins and prevent termination of elongation ( Zigmond et al . , 2003 ) . We tested whether Sca2 could compete with the capping protein CapZ using the pyrene - actin elongation assay ( Fig . 2 . 3i ) . In control reactions containing CapZ and profilin , CapZ fully capped barbed ends . However , Sca2 and profilin competed with CapZ , permitting elongation at a rate equivalent to that of Sca2 and profilin alone . This further supports the hypothesis that Sca2 remains bound to barbed ends as they polymerize . To directly test whether Sca2 processively associates with barbed ends , we used TIRF microscopy to observe the effect of Sca2 on the polymerization of fluorescently labeled actin filaments anchored to coverslips by inactivated myosin . In a control reaction containing actin alone , filaments grew at 11 . 9 ± 0 . 3 subunits / sec ( mean ± SD , n = 8 ) ( Fig . 2 . 4a - c , Video 1 ) . In the presence of subnanomolar concentrations of GST - Sca2 , we observed two filament populations : free filaments that grew at a rate similar to controls ( 14 . 4 ± 0 . 9 subunits / sec , n = 8 ) , and Sca2 - bound filaments that grew extremely slowly ( 0 . 6 ± 0 . 2 subunits / sec ) ( Fig . 2 . 4d - f , Video 2 ) . The proportion of slow - growing filaments depended on the dose of Sca2 . Sca2 slowed elongation more dramatically than did the mammalian formin mDia2 ( Fig . 2 . 5 , Videos 3 , 4 ) , to a rate comparable that observed with Cdc12p ( Kovar et al . , 2003 ; Skau et al . , 2009 ) or DAAM ( Barko et al . , 2010 ) . In the presence of profilin , filaments in a control reaction behaved similarly to actin 34 Figure 2 . 4 .

However , inclusion of profilin with subnanomolar amounts of Sca2 caused the Sca2 - associated filaments to elongate significantly faster than in the absence of profilin ( 5 . 4 ± 0 . 6 subunits / sec , n = 8 ) ( Fig . 2 . 4j - l , Video 6 ) , confirming that Sca2 - mediated elongation is activated by profilin . Additionally , Sca2 - associated filaments were less intensely labeled than control filaments , a phenomenon that is observed with formins but not other actin nucleators ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ) . Importantly , Sca2 - bound filaments were rarely observed to switch from the dim slow - growing population to the bright fast - growing one , as was observed for mDia2 ( Fig . 2 . 5j - l ) and other formins ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ; Neidt et al . , 2008 ) , demonstrating that Sca2 associates with polymerizing barbed ends for extended periods of time ( > 10 min , > 5000 subunits added ) . To further confirm that Sca2 processively associates with barbed ends , we immobilized Sca2 on a coverslip and looked for buckling of actin filaments between their growing barbed ends and myosin anchor points along filament sides , a behaviour observed with mDia2 ( Fig . 2 . 5m , Video 7 ) and other formins ( Kovar and Pollard , 2004 ) . Notably , in the presence of profilin and immobilized GST - Sca2 , we observed actin filaments elongating and buckling ( Fig . 2 . 4m , Video 8 ) . Thus , Sca2 acts as a true functional mimic of host formins . The activity of purified Sca2 in vitro suggests that it participates in the actin - based motility of Rickettsia , which would require it to localize to the bacterial surface . To test this , we raised antibodies that recognized Sca2 on Western blots of R . parkeri - infected cell lysates ( Fig . 2 . 6a ) . Abundant Sca2 was detected by immunofluorescence microscopy on the surface of R . parkeri in infected Vero ( Fig . 2 . 6b ) or Drosophila S2R + cells ( Fig . 2 . 6c , d ) , independent of the presence of an actin tail . When a tail was present , Sca2 was generally enriched at actin - associated bacterial surfaces . Sca2 was not detected along the length of the tail , suggesting that it is not released from Rickettsia during movement . To determine whether surface - bound Sca2 is sufficient to assemble actin in cell cytoplasm in the absence of other bacterial factors , we coated polystyrene beads ( 0 . 5 - 2 . 0 µm diameter ) with GST - Sca2 and observed their ability to polymerize rhodamine - actin in Xenopus laevis egg extract . Sca2 beads tended to form clumps , from which dense starbursts of actin filaments assembled and lengthened over time ( Fig . 2 . 6e , Video 9 ) . Once formed , the actin starbursts persisted for extended periods ( > 30 min ) . This demonstrates that Sca2 is sufficient to nucleate actin filaments and promote their elongation in the context of cell cytoplasm . Our results show that Rickettsia have evolved a mechanism of polymerizing host actin through functional mimicry of eukaryotic formins by the bacterial surface protein Sca2 . The ability of Sca2 to nucleate unbranched filaments and protect them from capping corresponds with the long , parallel filament organization in Rickettsia tails ( Gouin et al . , 1999 ; Van Kirk et al . , 2000 ) . Moreover , the profilin - dependent elongation mechanism is consistent with the requirement for profilin for Rickettsia motility in cells ( Serio et al . , 2010 ) . Although it has been proposed that both Sca2 and RickA might contribute to Rickettsia motility ( Kleba et al . , 2010 ) , our work together with other evidence suggests that Sca2 plays a primary role . In particular , the observation that actin tails assemble independently of the host Arp2 / 3 complex ( Harlander et al . , 2003 ; Heinzen , 2003 ; Serio et al . , 2010 ) argues against a RickA - dependent motility mechanism . Moreover , the recent discovery that a transposon insertion in sca2 abolishes R . rickettsii actin tail formation indicates that Sca2 is required for actin assembly ( Kleba et al . , 2010 ) . Further evidence comes from correlations between the sca2 and rickA gene sequences and the properties of actin - based motility of various Rickettsia species ( Fig . 2 . 7 ) . Both sca2 and rickA are intact and 39 Figure 2 . 6 . Sca2 localizes to actin - associated bacterial surfaces and is sufficient to promote actin polymerization in cell extracts . ( a ) Polyclonal anti - Sca2 antibody recognizes Sca2 on Western blots . Total protein lysate from purified R . parkeri ( lane 1 ) , and equal volumes of total protein lysates from R . parkeri - infected ( lane 2 ) or uninfected ( lane 3 ) Vero cells , were separated by SDS - PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies raised against the N - terminal 500 amino acids of Sca2 . The antibody recognizes a major band at the predicted size of full - length Sca2 ( 202 kDa ) , as well as likely degradation products ( 80 kDa and 58 kDa ) , and a Vero cell protein ( 34 kDa ) .

The motility properties of Rickettsia species correlate with the sequence of the sca2 gene and its protein product . Listed species are those for which whole genome sequence information is available and published reports document their capacity to undergo actin - based motility . For each species , the phylogenomic grouping ( Gillespie et al . , 2008 ) , the capacity to undergo motility , the actin tail structure , and the presence or absence of genes encoding RickA and Sca2 are indicated . A diagram of the predicted domain organization of Sca2 is shown , based on comparison of each protein sequence with Sca2 from R . parkeri .

However , in the typhus group species R . typhi , which undergoes actin - based motility but forms shorter actin tails of unknown filament organization ( Heinzen , 2003 ; Van Kirk et al . , 2000 ) , sca2 encodes a divergent protein , whereas rickA is absent . Conversely , in R . canadensis , a species of uncertain phylogeny ( Gillespie et al . , 2008 ) that does not undergo actin - based motility ( Heinzen et al . , 1993 ) , the rickA gene is apparently intact , but sca2 contains deletions compared with R . parkeri , the largest of which occurs in the N - terminal domain . The simplest interpretation of these observations is that Sca2 drives motility and RickA participates in host - cell invasion , a process that is thought to depend on the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Martinez and Cossart , 2004 ) . We asked whether other cellular nucleators , such as formins or Spire , might contribute to R . parkeri motility . RNAi targeting of single nucleators in Drosophila S2R + cells did not reveal significant defects in R . parkeri actin tail formation ( Serio et al . , 2010 ) . Because Drosophila express six formins with varying levels of homology , functional redundancy could occur . We therefore tested whether RNAi targeted against multiple formins might reveal a defect in R . parkeri actin tail formation in Drosophila S2R + cells ( Fig . 2 . 8 ) . First , we targeted formin pairs and triplets , grouped by homology . Because Spire cooperates with the formin cappucino ( Rosales - Nieves et al . , 2006 ) , we also targeted these two nucleators simultaneously . None of the tested combinations resulted in a defect in R . parkeri actin tail formation ( Fig . 2 . 8a ) . Next , we targeted all six formins simultaneously ( Fig . 2 . 8b ) and quantified actin tails as well as short actin nubs , presumed to be precursors to full tails . No reduction in actin nubs or tails was observed . Although the lack of antibodies specific for most Drosophila formins precluded quantification of RNAi depletion efficiency , depletion of the Drosophila formin diaphanous is known to interfere with cytokinesis and results in large , multinucleate cells ( Rogers et al . , 2003 ) . Thus , cell morphology acts as a partial internal control . Large , multinucleate cells were observed in our samples in equivalent proportion whether we targeted diaphanous singly or in combination with other formins , suggesting that targeting multiple genes did not significantly reduce the efficiency of RNAi . Thus , although these experiments can not rule out a role for host formins in Rickettsia motility , they fail to provide evidence to support such a role . The striking similarity between the activities of Sca2 and formins raises the question of whether Sca2 structurally mimics formins or acts by a divergent mechanism . The core structural and functional unit of formins is the formin homology 2 ( FH2 ) domain , which forms an elongated , curved rod that assembles into donut - shaped dimers ( Chesarone et al . , 2010 ) . Although Sca2 does not share significant primary sequence similarity with this domain , the predicted secondary structure of the Sca2 N - terminus is surprisingly similar to that of FH2 ( Fig . 2 . 9 ) . To predict whether the Sca2 N - terminus might resemble FH2 domains at the level of tertiary structure , we submitted the sequence of Sca2 amino acids 34 - 670 to the mGenThreader fold recognition server ( McGuffin and Jones , 2003 ) . This computational method did not identify a high - probability match between Sca2 and any known protein structure . However , of the thousands of structures scored , the third and fourth highest - ranked matches were the FH2 domains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Bni1p and human DAAM1 , suggesting that Sca2 might contain a similar fold . We attempted to determine the oligomerization state of the Sca2 N - terminus by size - exclusion chromatography of purified Sca2 - 670 - His ( monomer size 74 kDa ) . The apparent molecular weight of the eluted protein was 294 kDa , consistent with a tetrameric complex . Bni1p was also reported to form tetramers as determined by size - exclusion 43 Figure 2 . 8 . RNAi targeting cellular formins does not reduce the frequency of R . parkeri actin tail formation . Monolayers of Drosophila S2R + cells were treated with double - stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) targeting the indicated proteins for 4 days , then infected with R . parkeri for 2 days . The percentage of Rickettsia associated with actin tails ( and also actin nubs in b ) was quantified and compared to negative controls ( either untreated or treated with dsRNA against a target that does not affect tail formation [ Serio et al . , 2010 ] ) . ( Cappu = cappucino , Dia = diaphanous . ) 44 Figure 2 . 9 . Sequence alignment of the N - terminus of Sca2 with FH2 domains of formins from various species . Sequences were aligned according to their predicted secondary structures , obtained from the Porter server ( Pollastri and McLysaght , 2005 ) . Structure predictions are shown below the primary sequences , with predicted helices ( h ) shaded light blue . The edges of predicted helices were aligned manually , while attempting to minimize gaps and preserve primary sequence alignment within the formins . The actual secondary structure and helix - lettering scheme of Bni1p ( Xu et al . , 2004 ) determined by x - ray crystallography is included in the last row and highlighted in dark blue . Residues that are conserved in diverse formins and also found in Sca2 are shaded yellow , or pink for those of known functional importance . The functionally important GNYMN motif is shaded in grey . Bni1p residues known to contact actin ( Otomo et al . , 2005 ) are marked with a caret ( ∨ ) . Residues that are missing from R . peacockii Sca2 are underlined . ( Hs = Homo sapiens , Sp = Schizzosaccharomyces pombe , Sc = Saccharomyces cerevisiae . ) 45 chromatography and static light scattering ( Zigmond et al . , 2003 ) , but the crystal structure suggests that it binds actin as a donut - shaped dimer ( Otomo et al . , 2005 ) . Other FH2 domains , such as mammalian FRL α ( Harris et al . , 2004 ) , elute earlier than expected from size - exclusion columns due to their elongated shape . Thus , additional experiments , such as analytical ultracentrifugation , are required to determine the oligomerization state of Sca2 . Nonetheless , several lines of evidence suggest that the Sca2 N - terminus might be a structural mimic of the FH2 domain , which was previously thought to be exclusively eukaryotic ( Chalkia et al . , 2008 ) . The domain organization of Sca2 , with its putative FH2 - like domain located N - terminal to its PRDs , is inverted compared to the arrangement in formins . We propose that the WH2s and / or PRDs deliver actin monomers to the N - terminal domain to enable efficient nucleation and elongation . The molecular details of Sca2 - mediated actin assembly remain to be determined and will likely exhibit general similarities and interesting differences with eukaryotic formins . Adaptation of a formin - dependent mechanism for actin assembly distinguishes Rickettsia from well - studied motile pathogens , which require the host Arp2 / 3 complex ( and in some cases NPFs ) for actin - based motility ( Gouin et al . , 2005 ; Stevens et al . , 2006 ) . This raises an intriguing question : what evolutionary advantage is conferred by each strategy ? Mimicry of formins enables Rickettsia to bypass a requirement for host protein intermediates , which could be critical for a life cycle that involves infection of diverse species ( arthropods and mammals ) and cell types . A recent report suggests that cell - to - cell spread of Shigella flexneri is impacted by inactivation of the mammalian formins mDia1 and mDia2 , although these proteins do not participate in actin - based motility ( Heindl et al . , 2010 ) . Therefore , exploitation of formin - mediated actin assembly pathways might be a more widespread pathogenic strategy . In the future , Rickettsia motility can be exploited to further elucidate the cellular functions of formins and other factors that influence the assembly of long , parallel actin filaments . 46 Materials and Methods Bioinformatics ( WH2 homology search , sequence alignments , and structure prediction ) . The PHI - BLAST algorithm was used to search NCBI databases ( restricted to Rickettsia taxid : 780 ) using the query RxxLLxxIxxxxxxLKKV and the pattern L - [ LM ] - X ( 1 , 3 ) - I - X ( 3 , 8 ) - L - [ KRH ] - [ KRHQSPN ] - [ VILATSG ] . This query matched a motif in R . felis that was similar to motifs in R . parkeri . Putative WH2 motifs were aligned manually based on characteristics that include a short amphiphilic helix , a variable linker sequence , and an LKkv motif defined by invariant leucine , a basic residue , a basic or variable residue , and a small residue ( Dominguez , 2007 ) . These motifs differ from the WH2 sequences defined by Kleba et al . ( Kleba et al . , 2010 ) . Similarity scoring was done in Geneious software v4 . 5 . 4 ( Biomatters ) using the Blosum45 matrix and default settings . Alignment of Sca2 and RickA protein or translated nucleotide sequences was performed in Geneious using the Geneious Align algorithm and corrected manually . Tertiary structure prediction was performed using mGenThreader v8 . 1 ( McGuffin and Jones , 2003 ) . Our sequence of full - length R . parkeri Sca2 is deposited in GenBank under accession number HM055592 . Molecular biology . The sca2 gene was amplified by PCR from boiled R . parkeri and subcloned into either pGEX4T - 2 , using BamHI and XhoI sites ( GST constructs ) , or pET22b , using NcoI and XhoI sites .

Sca2 derivatives were expressed in E . coli BL21 - CodonPlus ( DE3 ) - RIPL cells ( Stratagene ) induced with 1 mM IPTG overnight at 16˚C . Cell suspensions were sonicated , and proteins were isolated using Glutathione Sepharose 4B ( GE Healthcare ) or Ni - NTA agarose ( Qiagen ) affinity chromatography . For some experiments the GST tag was cleaved by incubation with thrombin for 2 . 5 h at room temperature . Eluted proteins were further purified by gel - filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 10 / 300 GL column ( GE Healthcare ) into protein storage buffer ( 20 mM MOPS pH 7 . 0 or HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM KCl , 5 mM EGTA , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 10 % glycerol ) . GST - mDia2 ( FH1FH2 ) , encompassing amino acids 521 - 1171 , was also expressed in E . coli and purified by glutathione affinity chromatography , but eluted protein was further purified by chromatography on a Source Q column ( GE Healthcare ) and dialyzed against mDia2 storage buffer ( 5 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , pH 7 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 mM EGTA , 0 . 5 mM DTT ) . GST - RickA purification was described previously ( Jeng et al . , 2004 ) . Human platelet profilin was purified by passing platelet extracts over a poly - L - proline affinity 47 column as described previously ( Janmey , 1991 ) , washing in wash buffer ( 20 mM PIPES pH 6 . 8 , 150 mM KCl , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 3 M urea ) , and then eluting with wash buffer plus 7 M urea . Profilin was dialyzed into storage buffer ( 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 7 , 20 mM KCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 100 mM sucrose ) . Proteins were flash frozen in liquid N 2 and stored at – 80˚C , except GST - mDia2 ( FH1FH2 ) was kept at 4º C ( however , contrary to a previous report ( Li and Higgs , 2005 ) , the activity of flash - frozen GST - mDia2 ( FH1FH2 ) was identical to aliquots stored at 4º ) . Pyrene - actin polymerization assays . Rabbit muscle actin and pyrene - labeled actin ( Cytoskeleton , Inc . ) were resuspended in G buffer ( 5 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT ) , dialyzed into G buffer for > 16 h , and stored at 4˚C . Polymerization assays included 1 µM actin monomers , 10 % pyrene - labeled . Polymerization was initiated by adding 10x initiation buffer ( 10 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM EGTA , 5 mM ATP , 500 mM KCl ) , bringing final buffer components to 1 mM MgCl 2 , 2 . 2 mM EGTA , 0 . 7 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 75 mM KCl . In experiments with GST - Sca2 - 1106 and GST - Sca2 - 670 , KCl was omitted from initiation buffer , and the final KCl concentration was 25 mM . For kinetic experiments , fluorescence was detected at 20 s intervals on a Fluorolog - 3 model FL3 - 11 spectrofluorometer ( Horiba Jobin Yvon Inc . ) at 365 nm excitation and 407 nm emission , using SpectrAcq v5 . 20 and DataMax v2 . 2 . 12B software . Data were normalized ( min = first value in each data set , max = highest value from complete experiment ) and graphed using Prism v5 . 0b ( GraphPad Software ) . Initial polymerization rates were calculated from the first 60 s or 100 s of normalized data . Elongation assays were derived from Moseley et al . ( Moseley et al . , 2006 ) . Briefly , unlabeled actin filaments were added to proteins of interest in F buffer ( 5 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 7 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM DTT ) and sheared 5x through a 27G syringe . Half of this mixture was added to actin monomers ( final concentration 0 . 4 or 0 . 5 µM , 10 % pyrene - labeled ) , then transferred to a cuvette containing 10x initiation buffer . For competition experiments , proteins ( Sca2 , CapZ , and profilin ) were mixed with F buffer before adding actin seeds . Affinity of Sca2 for barbed ends was estimated from initial elongation rates using Prism software with default “One - site binding” parameters . Depolymerization was induced by diluting preformed actin filaments ( 1 µM , 50 % pyrene labeled ) 1 : 10 into polymerization buffer containing Sca2 . To determine the effect of Sca2 on actin critical concentration ( Cc ) , actin monomers ( 10 % pyrene labeled , 1 µM final concentration ) were mixed with a range of Sca2 concentrations and initiation buffer , then incubated overnight . Pyrene fluorescence readings were collected on a PerkinElmer Victor X3 plate reader with 355 nm excitation and 405 / 410 nm emission filters . Control reactions established the baseline fluorescence of pyrene - actin monomers and confirmed that the Cc was 0 . 1 µM as expected . Baseline - corrected fluorescence data were converted to units of actin polymer . Epifluorescence and TIRF microscopy to visualize actin filaments . For epifluorescence microscopy , pyrene - actin polymerization reactions were stabilized by mixing with equimolar rhodamine - phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) , diluted 1 : 50 into fluorescence buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 3 mg / ml dextrose , 10 mM imidazole pH 7 . 0 , 10 mM DTT , 0 . 5 % methylcellulose , 20 µg / ml catalase and 25 U / ml glucose oxidase ) and observed using an Olympus IX71 microscope with a 100x ( 1 . 35 NA ) PlanApo objective and a Photometrics CoolSNAP HQ camera controlled through MetaMorph v5 . 0r7 ( Molecular Devices ) . Brightness and contrast were adjusted , 48 greyscale inverted , and dimensions set to 300 dpi in Photoshop CS4 ( Adobe ) . Filament lengths were measured for at least 200 filaments ( buffer control , n = 415 ; profilin , n = 209 ; Sca2 , n = 356 ; Sca2 plus profilin , n = 351 ) from 6 - 10 random fields per condition using the ImageJ NeuronJ plugin ( Meijering et al . , 2004 ) . Pixels were converted to microns in Excel ( Microsoft ) . Statistical significance was assessed in Prism using the Kruskal - Wallis test . TIRF microscopy was performed essentially as described previously ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ; Neidt et al . , 2008 ) . The growth of 8 filaments was measured over the course of 300 - 600 s for each condition and population using custom ImageJ plugins and Excel macros ( Kuhn and Pollard , 2005 ) . The minimal growth of Sca2 - associated filaments in the absence of profilin made it impossible to distinguish barbed from pointed end , so total filament length was measured . Immobilization experiments were performed as described previously ( Kovar and Pollard , 2004 ) . Images and videos were prepared as described previously ( Kovar et al . , 2006 ) . Tissue culture and bacterial growth . R . parkeri str . Portsmouth was a gift from C . Paddock ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ) ( Paddock et al . , 2004 ) . Tissue culture conditions were described previously ( Serio et al . , 2010 ) . For infections , R . parkeri was purified by Renografin density gradient centrifugation ( Hackstadt et al . , 1992 ) and added to the media of cells growing on glass coverslips , and infection continued at 33º C for 2 d . Detection of Sca2 by Western blot and immunofluorescence . The purified N - terminal 500 amino acids of Sca2 with a 6x His tag ( Sca2 - 500 - His ) was used to raise antisera in rabbits ( Covance Inc ) . Affinity purification was performed by standard methods using GST - Sca2 - 670 conjugated to Affigel - 10 ( Bio - Rad ) . Eluted antibodies were dialyzed into antibody storage buffer ( 10 mM MOPS pH 7 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 35 % glycerol ) . For Western blots , proteins were separated by SDS - PAGE , transferred to nitrocellulose , incubated with anti - Sca2 antibodies ( 0 . 2 µg / ml ) for 2 h , probed with anti - rabbit HRP secondary antibodies for 1 h , then detected with Lumigen TMA - 6 ( Lumigen ) . For immunofluorescence , Vero or Drosophila S2R + cells were fixed 2 d post - infection with 4 % formaldehyde in PBS and blocked with PBS + 2 % BSA + 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 . Anti - Sca2 antibodies were used at 2 µg / ml . Rickettsia were detected with anti - rOmpA 14 - 13 monoclonal antibodies ( Anacker et al . , 1987 ) diluted 1 : 300 , and filamentous actin was detected with Alexa 488 - phalloidin at 0 . 5 U / ml . Secondary antibodies were Alexa 568 goat anti - rabbit ( Invitrogen ) and AMCA donkey anti - mouse ( Jackson ) . Coverslips were mounted with ProLong Gold ( Invitrogen ) . S2R + cells were imaged on an Applied Precision DeltaVision 4 Spectris deconvolution microscope with a 100x ( 1 . 4 NA ) PlanApo objective and a Photometrics CH350 CCD camera . Images were captured using SoftWoRx v3 . 3 . 6 ( Applied Precision ) and deconvolved with Huygens Professional v3 . 1 . 0p0 ( Scientific Volume Imaging ) . Slices covering 4 µm of depth were merged using ImageJ’s ZProjection at Max Intensity . Brightness was adjusted and dimensions set to 300 dpi in Photoshop CS4 . Vero cells were imaged by epifluorescence microscopy ( described above ) . Actin polymerization on beads in Xenopus extract . Polystyrene microspheres ( Polysciences , Inc . , 0 . 5 µm and 2 µm , non - functionalized ) were incubated on ice with 1 - 10 µM Sca2 for 1 h before adding BSA to 5 mg / ml and incubating 15 min . Beads were washed in CSF - XB ( 10 mM HEPES pH 7 . 7 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 100 mM KCl , 5 mM EGTA , 50 mM sucrose ) and kept at 4˚C . Xenopus laevis egg extract was provided by the laboratory of R . Heald . To 8 µl of extract , 1 49 µl of actin ( 3 µM , 20 % rhodamine - labeled ) and 1 µl of beads were added . 2 - 3 µl was placed between a slide and coverslip and observed immediately by epifluorescence microscopy ( described above ) , or sealed with nail polish and observed after 2 - 30 min incubation . For Video 9 , 1 µl of 1 % Triton X - 100 was also included . Images were recorded every 20 s ( Fig . 6e ) or 15 s ( Video 9 ) . ImageJ was used to adjust brightness and contrast and export QuickTime movies . RNA synthesis and RNAi . RNAi in Drosophila S2R + cells was performed as described previously ( Serio et al . , 2010 ) , except that final RNA concentration for the experiment shown in Fig . 2 . 8b was 10 µg / ml . 50 References Anacker , R .

Curr Biol . 13 : 1820 - 3 . 54 CHAPTER 3 Future Directions 55 Future Directions R . parkeri Sca2 acts at the crossroads of eukaryotic and bacterial biology , and thus offers avenues for discovery in both host cytoskeletal dynamics and microbial pathogenesis . On the eukaryotic side , a pressing question is whether the tertiary structure of R . parkeri Sca2 is similar to that of formins . Knowing the structure of Sca2 would facilitate dissection of its molecular interactions with actin and profilin and permit detailed comparison to formins . It will also be important to ask whether Sca2 interacts with other host proteins or possesses additional activities , as do some formins ( Chesarone et al . , 2010 ) . On the microbial side , an important question is whether the mechanism of SFG Rickettsia motility provides particular advantages during infection compared to that of Listeria and Shigella . Understanding the advantages of Sca2 - mediated motility might also shed light on endogenous formin - mediated motility processes . A final intriguing question is whether the divergent Sca2 proteins encoded by non - SFG Rickettsia possess formin - like activity or perhaps assemble actin by a different mechanism . Analysis of divergent Sca2 proteins could illuminate how actin - based motility evolved in the Rickettsia genus . Structure and molecular mechanism of Sca2 Obtaining a crystal structure of the R . parkeri Sca2 N - terminal domain complexed with actin would be a significant advance towards understanding its molecular mechanism of action . Our prediction is that the N - terminal domain of Sca2 forms an elongated , curved rod that assembles into doughnut - shaped dimers , analogous to formin FH2 domains . Crystal structures of several FH2 domains in complex with actin have been determined ( Lu et al . , 2007 ; Otomo et al . , 2005 ; Xu et al . , 2004 ) , which could facilitate solving the structure of Sca2 and / or identifying functionally important amino acid residues . Before attempting to crystalize the Sca2 N - terminus , it is necessary to determine the minimal region sufficient for FH2 - like activity . Our experiments so far have used a truncation derivative consisting of the first 670 amino acids of Sca2 ( minus the predicted 33 - amino - acid secretion signal ) . We encounter a moderate level of degradation during purification of this derivative , suggesting it is not optimally stable . Comparison of the Sca2 amino acid sequence to FH2 domains suggests that the active domain might consist of only the first ~ 450 residues of Sca2 . A derivative of this length , containing the minimal nucleation domain , might be more stable and increase the chance of successful crystallization . A minor technical hurdle in defining the minimal nucleation domain is the validation of an optimal fusion partner for Sca2 derivatives . In previous experiments , we used Sca2 derivatives tagged with 6xHis or GST , or with the GST tag removed by thrombin treatment . Each of these constructs has a drawback . The 6xHis fusions had poor solubility and low yield . The GST tag dimerizes , precluding the identification of truncations that abrogate the presumed inherent dimerization of Sca2 . Lastly , cleavage of the GST tag adds an extra step to the purification , which could be cumbersome when evaluating a series of derivatives . Fortunately , N - terminal fusion tags do not appear to alter Sca2 activity ( chapter 2 ) . We have begun to test a new tag , SUMO , which improves the solubility of fusion partners but does not dimerize . We constructed ( in collaboration with QB3 MacroLab ) a SUMO - tagged Sca2 passenger domain . If we achieve good yields of SUMO - Sca2 and confirm that its in vitro activity is comparable to 56 untagged Sca2 , we will generate a series of truncation derivatives to identify the minimal N - terminal domain that is sufficient for nucleation . Using the minimal domain , we plan to collaborate with a crystallographer to obtain the tertiary structure of the Sca2 N - terminus complexed with actin . The solved structure would facilitate identification of actin - binding interfaces and presumed dimerization regions . This knowledge would support molecular dissection of Sca2 activity , which we predict will broaden our understanding of formin biochemistry . It would also allow us to generate mutations that alter polymerization properties , which could be used to answer interesting questions about the contribution of Sca2 activity to R . parkeri biology ( discussed below ) . Alternatively , it is possible the crystal structure of Sca2 might reveal little or no similarity to eukaryotic formins – such an unexpected result would open a window onto a completely novel mechanism of actin assembly . Host factors required for Sca2 activity and Rickettsia motility The importance of host profilin for Sca2 activity ( chapter 2 ) and for R . parkeri motility ( Serio et al . , 2010 ) is clear , but the molecular details of the interaction between Sca2 and profilin are unknown . For instance , does profilin bind both of the PRDs in Sca2 ? If so , are there differences in its affinity for the two domains ? Why does Sca2 have two separate PRDs when most formins have only one ? It is conceivable that the two PRDs could be involved in different aspects of Sca2 activity ; for example one might be predominantly involved in nucleation , while the other is more important during elongation . These questions could be addressed by site - directed mutagenesis of proline residues within the PRDs , which should abrogate profilin binding . Another intriguing question is whether sequence differences between tick and mammalian profilins affect Sca2 activity . Profilins from diverse organisms – or even profilin isoforms from the same species – when complexed with actin can interact differently with formins in vitro , altering actin polymerization rates ( Ezezika et al . , 2009 ; Neidt et al . , 2009 ) . Profilin is poorly conserved across the evolutionary distance from arthropods to mammals ( e . g . < 20 % identical , < 30 % similar between human and Drosophila melanogaster profilins ) . The experiments in chapter 2 were performed with human profilin purified from platelets . It would be interesting to compare the activity of tick versus human profilin in Sca2 - mediated actin polymerization assays . A dramatically different polymerization rate with tick profilin could suggest that actin - based motility plays a different role in arthropods compared to mammals . Additionally , it is possible that Sca2 differentially utilizes human profilin isoforms , which could affect the spread of Rickettsia within different cell types , but this seems less likely given that the main human isoform , profilin 1 , is ubiquitously expressed ( Jockusch et al . , 2007 ) . Depletion experiments in insect and mammalian cells showed that , in addition to profilin , the host protein fimbrin ( T - plastin in mammals ) is specifically important for the motility of R . parkeri but not L . monocytogenes ( Serio et al . , 2010 ) . Investigating why fimbrin depletion interferes with R . parkeri motility could shed light on fimbrin function in cellular actin structures . Evidence from fission yeast demonstrates that fimbrin controls actin filament dynamics by competing with tropomyosin for binding to actin filament sides , which regulates access to filaments by proteins involved in severing , nucleation , and contractility ( Clayton et al . , 2010 ; Skau and Kovar , 2010 ) . Actin structures rich in fimbrin recruit a partially distinct set of proteins compared to structures rich in tropomyosin , and the two types of structures have different kinetic properties ( Skau and Kovar , 2010 ) . This role of fimbrin as an access - controller has not yet been investigated in other organisms . SFG Rickettsia tails might be an example of the 57 “fimbrin - rich” class of structures – conversely , they contain little tropomyosin ( Van Kirk et al . , 2000 ) . Thus , Rickettsia tails could serve as a model to understand how the fimbrin - rich state is established . A starting point could be to ask if Sca2 directly interacts with fimbrin , or if fimbrin is recruited to Rickettsia tails by another mechanism . The role of the host Arp2 / 3 complex and its rickettsial activator RickA in SFG Rickettsia motility is unsettled ( Gouin et al . , 2004 ; Gouin et al . , 1999 ; Harlander et al . , 2003 ; Heinzen , 2003 ; Jeng et al . , 2004 ; Serio et al . , 2010 ) . A significant technical hurdle in the quest to resolve this issue is the difficulty of performing targeted genetic deletions in Rickettsia . Recent progress in the development of genetic tools for Rickettsia , including directed mutagenesis ( Driskell et al . , 2009 ) and plasmids ( Baldridge et al . , 2010 ) , put this goal within reach . Targeted knockout of the R . parkeri rickA gene would provide unambiguous data , which was unobtainable by previous methods , finally answering whether RickA is required for R . parkeri actin - based motility , invasion , or both . If RickA is required for R . parkeri motility , it will be crucial to investigate how Arp2 / 3 and Sca2 nucleation activities are coordinated during Rickettsia infection . For instance , it has been proposed that Arp2 / 3 - mediated generation of Y - branches could be required to initiate motility , and that elongation activity by another factor ( such as Sca2 ) could predominate at a later stage ( Jeng et al . , 2004 ) . This model is similar to the convergent - elongation model of filopodia formation ( Svitkina et al . , 2003 ; Vignjevic et al . , 2003 ) and thus could potentially shed light on the transition from nucleation to elongation phases in filopodia . Within cells , actin can potentially interact with hundreds of proteins that regulate filament nucleation , elongation , capping , cross - linking , contractility , severing , and monomer recycling . Aside from actin and profilin , potential direct interactions between Sca2 and other host proteins have not been investigated . Pull - down experiments might identify additional interacting partners of Sca2 . Whether or not additional Sca2 - binding partners are found , many host proteins localize to SFG Rickettsia actin tails ( Gouin et al . , 1999 ; Serio et al . , 2010 ; Van Kirk et al . , 2000 ) and contribute to motility ( Serio et al . , 2010 ) , and characterizing their roles will provide a more complete understanding of Sca2 - driven propulsion . Given that many formins possess additional activities – such as actin filament bundling , severing , or microtubule binding – and are regulated by diverse upstream signals ( reviewed in ( Chesarone et al . , 2010 ) , it would also be worthwhile to investigate whether Sca2 shares any of these properties . Characterizing host proteins that interact with Sca2 or are required for SFG Rickettsia motility might ultimately permit in vitro reconstitution of Sca2 - mediated motility using purified proteins , as has been achieved for motility mediated by the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Loisel et al . , 1999 ) or formin FH1 - FH2 domains ( Romero et al . , 2004 ) . Biological roles of formin - mediated motility An essential outstanding question about Sca2 - mediated motility is what advantage ( s ) it affords SFG Rickettsia compared to the Arp2 / 3 - based motility mechanisms of other bacterial pathogens . As mentioned in chapter 2 , one potential advantage lies in bypassing the requirement for a host nucleator , which might facilitate infection in diverse species and cell types . Another possible advantage is suggested by recent work showing that cell - to - cell spread of Shigella is diminished following depletion of the mammalian formins mDia1 and mDia2 ( Heindl et al . , 2010 ) . As described in chapter 1 , the structure and protein composition of Shigella and Listeria actin tails changes after they contact the plasma membrane and form protrusions into neighboring cells . Actin filaments in Listeria or Shigella tails within protrusions tend to be longer and less 58 branched than filaments in cytoplasmic tails ( Gouin et al . , 1999 ; Sechi et al . , 1997 ) . Thus , it seems plausible that formins contribute to the structure of Listeria and Shigella actin tails within protrusions . Together , this evidence suggests that formin - mediated actin polymerization at the plasma membrane can enhance the efficiency of protrusion formation and cell - to - cell spread by actin - motile pathogens . Listeria and Shigella tails undergo a gradual transition from cytoplasmic , Arp2 / 3 - mediated dendritic structures to rigid , membrane - bound protrusions ( reviewed in chapter 1 ) . Because SFG Rickettsia encode their own formin - like nucleator and appear to express it constitutively , they might form protrusions more quickly and spread more efficiently . As mentioned above , dissecting the molecular mechanism of Sca2 and generating mutants with altered activity would enable us to test how particular aspects of Sca2 - mediated actin assembly affect cell - to - cell spread . For instance , is spreading efficiency or protrusion formation affected by the motility rate ? By compactness of the bundles within tails ? By the recruitment of accessory proteins ? Do any mutations have differential effects on cell - to - cell spread compared to cytoplasmic motility ? These experiments would require genetic manipulation of Rickettsia ( or expression in a heterologous organism ) , but , as mentioned in the previous section , these manipulations are now becoming possible . The flip side of the question of biological advantages is whether formin - mediated motility has drawbacks compared to Arp2 / 3 - mediated motility . Presumably some trade - offs exist ; otherwise , it seems likely that more pathogens would have evolved a formin - like mechanism ( discussed in the next section ) . Defining the unique pros and cons of formin - mediated versus Arp2 / 3 - mediated bacterial motility could shed light on the roles of these modes of motility in endogenous cellular processes . Arp2 / 3 - mediated propulsion is implicated in vesicle rocketing ( Marchand et al . , 1995 ; Merrifield et al . , 1999 ; Taunton et al . , 2000 ) and lamellipodia protrusion ( Borisy and Svitkina , 2000 ; Bugyi et al . , 2008 ; Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) , whereas formin - mediated motility is implicated in the migration of meiotic chromosomes in oocytes ( Li et al . , 2008 ) . Why certain cellular processes employ different nucleators during actin - based motility is unknown , but the contrast between SFG Rickettsia and Listeria motility could help address this question . Evolution of Rickettsia actin - based motility SFG Rickettsia are currently the only pathogens known to employ a formin - based motility mechanism . Other pathogens that employ actin - based motility – including species of Listeria , Shigella , Burkholderia , Mycobacteria , vaccinia virus , and baculovirus – all appear to exploit the Arp2 / 3 complex . Many factors could contribute to this skewed distribution . For instance , sampling error might play a part ( instances of formin - mediated motility might exist among bacterial species that have not been studied ) . Alternatively , Arp2 / 3 - mediated motility could be more prevalent in nature . The Arp2 / 3 complex might provide unknown biophysical or biological advantages over formin - mediated motility . Or , given that NPFs are smaller and structurally simpler than formins , it seems plausible that they would arise more frequently in bacterial genomes by chance . Moreover , because Arp2 / 3 is a central player in phagocytosis and bacterial invasion , NPFs that evolve to promote entry could be repurposed for actin - based motility , facilitating acquisition of this trait . We hypothesize that a rickettsial ancestor originally evolved an Arp2 / 3 - based motility mechanism , perhaps mediated by a precursor to RickA or Sca2 , and that the formin - like N - terminal domain of Sca2 was acquired later , during the evolution of the SFG clade . Testing this hypothesis directly on rickettsial ancestors is of course impossible , but 59 Figure 3 . 1 : R . bellii Sca2 promotes actin polymerization . Polymerization of pyrene - actin ( 1 µM , 10 % pyrene labeled ) over time with the indicated concentrations of R . bellii Sca2 passenger domain fused to GST ( nM ) . 60 insight might be provided by comparing the activities of Sca2 from diverse extant Rickettsia . Two early - branching species , R . bellii and R . typhi , have highly divergent sca2 genes compared to SFG species and to each other , yet both undergo actin - based motility . Comparing their activities to R . parkeri Sca2 might illuminate how actin - based motility evolved in the Rickettsia genus , and could also inform broader questions about how pathogens acquire this virulence trait . R . bellii is the earliest - branching species of Rickettsia ( Ogata et al . , 2006 ) . As yet , only short tails have been reported for R . bellii ( Ogata et al . , 2006 ) , but the experimental conditions ( a relatively brief 6 hour infection at high MOI ) might not have been conducive to long tails . The tails were observed by fluorescence microscopy , which can not resolve filament architecture , so it remains unknown whether filaments are branched or linear . The R . bellii sca2 gene encodes a 896 amino acid protein ( Ogata et al . , 2006 ) , much smaller than the 1 , 816 amino acids encoded by R . parkeri . We did not detect homology between R . bellii Sca2 and the N - terminal domain of R . parkeri Sca2 , suggesting it does not possess formin - like activity . Overall , the two passenger domains share only 21 % identity ( the autotransporters are 65 % identical ) . The predicted amino acid sequence of R . bellii Sca2 contains a single PRD , three sequences with partial similarity to WH2 motifs , and two acidic stretches that contain a tryptophan , similar to the acidic domain of NPFs . Thus , the primary sequence suggests that R . bellii Sca2 might function as an NPF , or perhaps as a tandem monomer - binding nucleator . We have begun to investigate the biochemistry of R . bellii Sca2 . We purified the R . bellii Sca2 passenger domain fused to GST ( using the same methods as for R . parkeri Sca2 ) and tested its activity in pyrene - actin polymerization assays . R . bellii Sca2 was sufficient to accelerate actin polymerization on its own , in the absence of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 3 . 1 ) . This preliminary data suggests that R . bellii Sca2 might function as a tandem monomer - binding nucleator . We have not yet investigated whether R . bellii Sca2 possesses formin - like properties . Such a result would be surprising , given the lack of sequence similarity to the R . parkeri N - terminal domain or to eukaryotic formins . R . typhi is a member of the typhus group ( TG ) , which split from the SFG after the divergence of R . bellii ( Gillespie et al . , 2008 ) . In infected cells , R . typhi forms short , curved actin tails ( Heinzen , 2003 ; Van Kirk et al . , 2000 ) , reminiscent of Listeria tails , suggesting an Arp2 / 3 - mediated mechanism . However , the ultrastructure of R . typhi tails is unknown . R . typhi sca2 encodes a 1 , 533 amino acid protein ( McLeod et al . , 2004 ) with 23 % identity to R . parkeri in the passenger domain ( 82 % in the autotransporter ) . Like R . bellii , the predicted R . typhi Sca2 protein lacks significant homology to the R . parkeri N - terminal domain , suggesting that it does not possess formin - like activity . R . typhi Sca2 contains a single PRD and seven sequences with full or partial similarity to WH2 motifs , supporting the hypothesis that it interacts with actin . However , we have not yet been able to purify recombinant R . typhi Sca2 to test this prediction . Characterization of R . bellii and R . typhi Sca2 will likely demonstrate whether the mechanism of actin nucleation by Sca2 has changed during the course of Rickettsia evolution . If differences are found , it will be particularly illuminating to test how these differences affect the motility properties of Rickettsia species during infection . Study of intracellular pathogens has yielded a wealth of knowledge about both microbial pathogenesis and eukaryotic cellular processes . Bacterial actin - based motility has been a particularly rich source of insight . Because SFG Rickettsia evolved a different solution to the engineering problem posed by actin - based motility , they provide a unique , alternative system to compare and contrast with Arp2 / 3 - mediated pathogen motility . Future studies should delineate the relative advantages of the two motility mechanisms . Similarly , R . parkeri Sca2 represents a 61 unique outgroup that can be productively compared and contrasted to eukaryotic formins , generating new understanding about the molecular requirements for processive actin filament assembly . 62 References Baldridge , G .
