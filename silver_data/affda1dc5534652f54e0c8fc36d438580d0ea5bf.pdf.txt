Characterization of Actin Filament Severing by Actophorin from Acanthamoeba castellanii Sutherland K . Maciver , Henry G . Zot , and Thomas D . Pbllard Department ofCell Biology and Anatomy , Johns Hopkins School ofMedicine , Baltimore , Maryland 21205 Abstract . Actophorin is an abundant 15 - kD actin - binding protein from Acanthamoeba that is thought to form a nonpolymerizable complex with actin monomers and also to reduce the viscosity of poly - merized actin by severing filaments ( Cooper et al . , 1986 . J . Biol . Chem . 261 : 477 - 485 ) . Homologous pro - teins have been identified in sea urchin , chicken , and mammalian tissues . Chemical crosslinking produces a 1 : 1 covalent complex of actin and actophorin . Ac - tophorin and profilin compete for crosslinking to actin monomers . The influence of actophorin on the steady - state actin polymer concentration gave a Kd of 0 . 2 fiM T o understand the mechanisms that regulate the assem - bly and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton , a catalog of more than 30 types of actin - binding proteins has been compiled in the hope that understanding the parts will give insight into the whole ( Stossel et al . , 1985 ; Pollard and Cooper , 1986 ) . The redundancy of the system is striking at the biochemical level where a variety of proteins can have similar activities . In a given cell type more than one protein can sequester actin monomers or nucleate actin polymeriza - tion or cap actin filaments or crosslink actin filaments . Fur - thermore , an individual protein can have two or more of these activities . The actin filament severing proteins illus - trate this redundancy . The best characterized severing proteins are the - 90 - kD gelsolin group ( Yin and Stossel , 1979 ) and the - 42 - kD frag - min / severin group ( Hasegawa et al . , 1980 ; Brown et al . , 1982 ) . Gelsolin requires Cam to sever actin filaments and is inhibited by phosphoinositides ( Janmey and Stossel , 1987 ) . It also caps the barbed end of actin filaments and forms nuclei for elongation by binding two actin monomers . These proteins consist of multiple functionally specialized domains sharing a common sequence motif . It is generally believed that both groups arose from a precursor of - 125 amino acids by a series of gene duplications resulting in frag - min / severin with three of these domains ( Ampe and Van - dekerckhove , 1987 ; Andre et al . , 1988 ) and gelsolin / villin with six domains ( Kwaitkowski et al . , 1986 ; Way and Weeds , 1988 ; Bazari et al . , 1988 ) . The current models for severing by both groups ofproteins involve the interaction of multiple domains with actin filaments .

Several new lines of evidence , including assays for ac - tin filament ends by elongation rate and depolymeriza - tion rate , show that actophorin severs actin filaments both at steady state and during spontaneous polymer - ization . This is confirmed by direct observation in the light microscope and by showing that the effects of ac - tophorin on the low shear viscosity of polymerized ac - tin cannot be explained by monomer sequestration . The severing activity of actophorin is strongly in - hibited by stoichiometric concentrations of phalloidin or millimolar concentrations of inorganic phosphate . The third class ofsevering proteins is distinct from the gel - solin and fragmin groups in most ways . This group includes actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) ( Bamburg et al . , 1980 ) and destrin ( Nishida et al . , 1985 ) from vertebrates , depactin from echinoderms ( Mabuchi , 1983 ) , and actophorin from Acanthamoeba ( Cooper et al . , 1986 ) . They are 15 , 000 - 20 , 000 molecular weight , and have related sequences ( Ta - kaqi et al . , 1988 ; Abe et al . , 1990 ; Moiyama et al . , 1990 ; Maciver , S . K . , unpublished observations ) . They each form a tight complex with actin monomers that does not polymer - ize itself or nucleate actin polymerization . By EM and vis - cometry these proteins appear to sever actin filaments but do not require Ca + + . Since they are not known to have internal sequence repeats or multiple functional domains , they must have a different severing mechanism than the gelsolin group . Some even questionwhether they sever actin filaments ( Stos - sel , 1989 ) . No gene disruptions or other genetic manipula - tions have been made to test their role in live cells . Neverthe - less , since actophorin is the second most abundant actin binding protein in the amoeba and since its relatives are pres - ent in high concentrations in a number of vertebrate organs ( Bamburg and Bray , 1987 ) , these proteins are likely to be important members of the actin system . Dictyostelium mu - tants deficient in severin are essentially normal ( Andre et al . , 1989 ) , and since some cell types have been shown to contain 1 .

In this study we show that actophorin actually severs actin filaments and that severing is controlled by inorganic phos - phate . This firmly places actophorin in the larger group of severing proteins that are thought collectively to contribute to the dynamics ofactin filaments in cells . We also establish the stoichiometry and affinity of the complex of actophorin with actin monomers . These biochemical properties will provide the foundation for interpreting the mechanism of ac - tion when the three - dimensional structure of actophorin be - comes available ( Magnus et al . , 1988 ) . In the accompanying paper ( Maciver et al . , 1991 ) , we show that the severing activ - ity of actophorin can promote the formation of large , stiff bundles of actin filaments in the presence of alpha - actinin . Materials and Methods Protein Purification Actin from rabbit skeletal muscle was prepared as described by MacLean - Fletcher and Pollard ( 1980 ) , using gel filtration on Sephacryl S - 300 in buffer - G ( 2 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM CaC12 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 3 mM NaN3 ) . Actin was labeled with N - ( 1 - pyrenyl ) iodoacetamide ( Molecular Probes Inc . , Eugene , OR ) by the method of Pollard ( 1984 ) . For the steady - state critical concentration experiments , pyrenyl actin was fur - therpurified by dialysis against buffer - G overnight followed by gel filtration ( S - 100 ) . The resulting actin did not give the apparently artifactual increase in fluorescence observed in mixtures of actophorin with pyrenyl actin monomers that was observed by Cooper et al . ( 1986 ) . Actophorin was purified fromAcanthamoeba castellanii exactly as described by Cooper et al . ( 1986 ) . Acanthamoeba profilins I and II were a gift from Donald Kaiser ( Johns Hopkins Medical School , Baltimore , MD ) . Phalloidin was pur - chased from Boehringer Mannheim Biochemical ( Indianapolis , IN ) . Wdeo - microscopic Visualization ofMicrofilament Severingby Actophorin The severing ofactin filamentsby actophorin was observed microscopically in a flow cell ( Kron et al . , 1991 ) . One face of the cell was coated with nitrocellulose , which served as a substrate for thebinding ofAcanthamoeba myosin - II . Myosin - I1 was bound passivelyat a concentration of0 . 012 mg / ml in Buffer - F ( 50 mM KCI , 12 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 1 mM MgSO4 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM CaC12 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 3 mM NaN3 ) . The re - maining protein binding sites were blocked with a solution containing 0 . 5 mg / ml BSA ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) in buffer - F ( Buffer - F / BSA ) . Rhodamine phalloidin - labeled actin ( Rh - Ph - actin ) was prepared by incubating 0 . 8 pM F - actin with 0 . 5 AM rhodamine phalloidin ( Molecular Probes , Inc . , Eu - gene , OR ) . The flow cell was filled with 0 . 11 AM Rh - Ph - actin in buffer - F / BSA andthe filaments were allowed tobindtothe immobilized myosin - II . The fluorescence of the actin solution was protected from photobleaching by replacing the flow cell medium with antifade buffer ( buffer - FBSA con - taining 3 mg / nil glucose , 0 . 1 mg / ml glucose oxidase , 0 . 018 mg / ml catalase , and 50 mM DTT ) . Severing was initiated by replacement of the flow cell solution with 8 . 2 AM Acophorin in antifade buffer . Individual actin filaments were imaged with anOlympus inverted micro - scope ( IMT2 ) in the fluorescence mode . The fluorescence images ina field wereenhanced using analogue signal processing and recorded onto 112 inch VHS tape at 30 full frames per second . 10 frames of a recorded field were averaged and photographed ( Polaroid Freeze - frame ) . The field width was calibrated with a stage micrometer subsequent to the data collection . Myosin - II was prepared fromAcanthamoeba ( SinardandPollard , 1989 ) ; thisprocedure was shown previouslytoyield myosin - II with a slow turnover of ATP due to endogenous phosphorylation ( Collins and Kom , 1981 ) . We confirmed that the myosin - 11 used in these experiments bound actin fila - ments but did not move or sever the filaments in the presence of ATP , pre - sumably because the myosin was phosphorylated endogenously . Low Shear lrscometry Apparent viscosity of actin filament solutions at low shear was measured The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 115 , 1991 with a falling ball ina 100 # 1 capillary tube ( CorningGlass , NewYork , NY ) ( Maclean - Fletcher and Pollard , 1980 ) . Actin was polymerized in the capil - lary by adding 20 # 1 of lOx KME buffer ( 500 mM KCI , 10 mM MgSO4 , 10 mM EGTA , 100 mM Tris - HCI , pH 8 . 0 ) to 180 - Al samples immediately before loading the sample . Samples were incubated in a temperature regu - lated water bath at 25Â°C . Unless otherwise stated the final actin concentra - tion was 10 AM , and the incubation time was greater than two hours . Kinetic Studies Polymerization of actin was measured by changes in fluorescence of N - ( 1 - pyrenyl ) iodoacetamide covalently attachedto cysteine 374 of actin or by 90Â° light scattering of unlabeled actin at 400 nm using a fluorescence spectrophotometer ( model 650 - 10S ; Perkin - Elmer Corp . , Pomona , CA ) . The number concentration offilaments was determined by measuring the rate ofpolymer elongation or shortening . The rate ofactin filament elonga - tion is directly proportional to the number concentration ofactin filaments and canbe either positiveor negative depending on the concentration ofac - tin monomers : Rate = k + [ Ai ] [ ends ] - k - [ ends ] where k + is the association rate constant , k - is the dissociation rate con - stant , Al is the actin monomer concentration and " ends " is the number con - centration of filaments . These rate constants have been measured ( Pollard , 1983 ; Pollard and Cooper , 1986 ) . When the actin concentration makes the value of the term k + ( Al ) > k - the filaments grow longer ; otherwise the fila - ments shorten . Either way , knowledge ofthe actin monomer concentration and the rate of change ofthe polymer concentration provide a direct mea - sure ofthe concentration ofends . Thedepolymerizationvariant ofthis assay was first used by Walsh ( 1984 ) and by Bryan and Coluccio ( 1985 ) to docu - ment severing of actin filaments by villin and gelsolin . The actin monomer sequestering activity ofactophorin or other actin binding proteins must , of course , be taken into account when making these calculations . Since ac - tophorin has equal effects on elongation at both ends of filaments ( Cooper et al . , 1986 ) , we used the sum of the rate constants in our calculations of the polymer number concentration . Depolymerization experiments were performed semi - automatically using a stopped flow rapid mixing device ( SFA - II Rapid Kinetics Accessory ; HiTech Scientific , England ) . Chemical Cross - linking 1 - Ethyl - 3 - ( 3 - dimethylaminopropyl ) - carbodiimide ( EDC ) and N - hydroxyl - sulfosuccinimide ( NHS ) were obtained from Pierce Chemical Co . ( Rock - ford , IL ) and were dissolved in 2 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7 . 5 immediately before use ( NHS was brought to pH 7 . 5 with 1 M NaOH ) . Chemical cross - linking was performed according to Vandekerkhove et al . ( 1989 ) . Briefly , EDC and NHC were added to samples ofrabbit muscle ac - tin , profilin and actophorin all at 10 AM , in 2 mM potassium phosphate to give finalconcentrations of 1 mMeach . After 10 min , more EDC and NHS were added to give a new concentration of 2 mM . After a further 10 min the reaction was stopped with the addition of 200 mM glycine stock ( pH 7 . 5 ) to give a final concentration of 9 mM . Products were analyzed by SDS - PAGE . Afterseparatingproteinsby SDS - PAGE , proteins wereelectro - phoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose , incubated with a mAb raised to actophorin ( Kaiser and Maciver , unpublished ) , and detected with peroxi - dase - labeled goat anti - mouse Ig ( ' lhgo , Burlingame , CA ) . Results Stoichiometry ofthe Complex ofActin with Actophorin Chemical crosslinking of mixtures of actin monomers and actophorin with the water soluble carbodiimide , EDC , pro - duced a new species of - 60 kD ( Fig . 1 ) . A 1 : 1 complex would have a molecular mass of 58 W . Both proteins had to be present with the crosslinker to produce the 60 - kD spe - cies . Antibodies to actophorin reacted with the 60 - kD band on immunoblots ( Fig . 1 B ) . As in the case of profilin cross - linking to actin ( Vandekerckhove et al . , 1989 ) , the yield of the actin - actophorin complex was much higher in the pres - ence of NHS , a reagent that stabilizes reactive intermediates 1612 on A p r il 8 , 2009 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published December 1 , 1991 formed by reaction of carboxyls with the carbodiimide . These reactions yield azero length crosslink between amine and carboxyl groups of the two proteins . In mixtures of actin , actophorin , and an Acanthamoeba profilin , a single actin monomer can be crosslinked to either oneof the profilins or to an actophorin molecule , but not to both types of actin binding protein simultaneously ( Fig . 1 ) . The simplest interpretation is that the binding sites for ac - tophorin and profilin on actin overlap , precluding the bind - ing of both molecules simultaneously . Affinity ofActophorinforActin Monomers Using light scattering and pyrenyl - actinfluorescence to mea - sure thesteady - state concentration ofpolymerizedactin over a range of actin concentrations , we obtained an estimate of the dissociation constant for the complex of actophorin with actin monomers . Actophorin reduces the polymer signal by the same amount at every actinconcentration above the criti - cal concentration ( Fig . 2 ) . In interpreting these data we as - sumed ( TobacmanandKorn , 1982 ; Tseng and Pollard , 1982 ) that once steady state is reached , the critical concentration of actin ( obtained from the break in the control plot ) is in equilibrium with complexes and that all other actin mole - cules are polymerized . The differences in the critical con - centrations in the presence of various concentrations of ac - tophorin provide a direct measure of the concentration of complex and gives a Kd of between 0 . 1 and 0 . 2 AM .

Experimental Evidence That Actophorin Severs Actin Filaments Five different experimental strategies , three qualitative and two quantitative , have provided consistent evidence that actophorin severs actin filaments . Most convincingly we directly visualized the severing of rhodamine - phalloidin - labeled actin filaments by actophorin in the light microscope ( Fig . 3 ) . This confirmed observations by EM ( Cooper et al . , 1986 and additional data not illustrated ) that the filaments were shorterin thepresence ofactophorin . Tvwo quantitative assays , an actin filament elongation assay ( Figs . 4and5 ) and an actin filament depolymerization assay ( Fig . 6 ) , showed that the number concentration of polymer ends is a function of the concentration of actophorin . Finally , actophorin reduces theviscosity ofpolymerized actin far out ofpropor - tion to its effect on polymer concentration ( Fig . 7 ) . The video microscopy assay provides direct evidence for severing as well as evidence for a possible mechanism . Severing began 10 - 20s after introduction of8 , % M actopho - rin into theflow cell ( Fig . 3 B ) and continued for 60 - 120 s until depolymerization and severing reduced the lengths of someofthe filaments belowthe resolution ofthe microscope ( Fig . 3 C ) . Severing frequently , but notexclusively , occurred at bends . We analyzedtherelationship between filament cur - vature and frequency of severing in two ways . First , we mea - sured the radius of curvature at 0 . 5 - pin intervals along 28 filaments from twoexperiments having a total length of 119 1613 on A p r il 8 , 2009 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published December 1 , 1991 ce UC U m 100 80 60 40 20 0 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 Actin gM Figure 2 . The effect of actophorin on the critical concentration for the polymerization ofrabbit muscle actin . The steady - state concen - tration of polymerized actin was assayed by pyrenyl - actin fluores - cence or 90Â° light scattering ( inset ) . Conditions : 12 mM Tris - HCI , pH 8 . 0 , 50 mM KCI , 1 mM MgSO 4 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 MM CaCI Z , 0 . 5 mM DTT , and 3 mM NaN 3 at room tempera - ture . Actin was 10 % pyrene labeled . Actophorin concentrations : 0 . 0 ( o ) ; 1 . 0 AM ( o ) ; 2 . 0 AM ( * ; 4 . 0 AM ( m ) . The intersection on the baseline ( dashed line ) gives a Kd of 0 . 1 - 0 . 2 AM assuming a 1 : 1 complex of actin with actophorin is formed . We calculated the fol - lowing Kd s : 0 . 15 AM for 1 AM actophorin , 0 . 12 AM for 2 and 0 . 14 AM for 4 . A Kd of 0 . 1 AM was calculated from the light scat - tering data ( inset ) . A . m . During the first minute with 8 AM actophorin , highly curved segments with a radius of curvature < 1 . 5 Am had a higher probability of severing ( P = 0 . 28 ) than segments with lesser curvature ( P = 0 . 16 ) . Second , we measured angles tangential to the sites of 21 severing events and compared Figure 3 . Videomicrograph ofactin filaments being severed by actophorin . ( A ) Field of filaments before the introduction of 8 . 2 AM actopho - rin . ( B ) Same field 15 s after the end of the flow . ( C ) Field after 40 s of actophorin . TheJournal of Cell Biology , Volume 115 , 1991 these angles to similarly measured angles at 21 other sites on the same filament population chosen in an unbiased man - ner . The null hypothesis ( severing is random ) returned a low probability ( P = 0 . 0005 ) in a t test . Therefore , although severing can occur at any site along a filament , it occurs more frequently at bends as illustrated in Fig . 3 . We were unsuccessful in initial attempts to observe sever - ing by actophorin using coverslips coated with myosin II at 0 . 2 mg / ml and actin filaments treated with equimolar rhodamine - phalloidin . However , by reducing the rhodamine - phalloidin / actin ratio to 1 : 2 and the myosin 11 concentration to0 . 012 mg / ml severing ofactin filaments was observed ( Fig . 3 ) . This severing required actophorin . No actin filaments were severed by anti - fade buffer alone . Thus filaments were not spontaneously broken , for example by the excitation light , as observed for microtubules ( Vigers et al . , 1988 ) . The elongation assay establishes that actophorin increases the number concentration of actin filaments at all stages of spontaneous polymerization ( Fig . 4 ) and at steady state ( Fig . 5 ) . After a lag , at the outset of spontaneous polymerization during which the first long polymers formed , samples with actophorin had a higher concentration of filaments than the control ( Fig . 4 ) . After the steady - state polymer concentra - tion is reached , the polymer number concentration is con - stant over 12 h ( 2 . 6 nM after 24 min ( Fig . 4 B ) and 2 . 5 nM after 12 h ( Fig . 5 A ) ) . At steady state ( 12 h after polymeriza - tion was initiated ) the number concentration of filaments was directly proportional to the actophorin concentration ( Fig . 5 A ) . Consequently , the log mean length ofthe filaments was an inverse function of the actophorin concentration ( Fig . 5 B ) . Compared with control filaments that average 22 Am in length , the filaments are < 1 . 0 Am long in 5 Am actophorin . If these short filaments are constantly annealing ( Murphy et al . , 1988 ) , there must also be continued severing . Actophorin increases the rate of depolymerization of fila - ments diluted well below the critical concentration ( Fig . 6 ) ; this provides another line ofevidence that , compared to con - trols , the number concentration offilaments is higher , the av - 1614 on A p r il 8 , 2009 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published December 1 , 1991 O U m d era E y aÂ° c , c EC NE21Od Minutes Maciver et al .

Actophorin accelerates the spontaneous polymerization by increasing the number concentration of filaments . The polymer concentration was measured by light scattering . Conditions : 12 mM Tris - HCI , pH 8 . 0 , 50 mM KCI , 1 mM MGS04 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM CaC12 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , and 3 mM NaN3 at 25Â°C . ( A ) Time course of spontaneous polymerization of 5 pM actin alone ( 0 ) , or with 1 AM actophorin ( o ) or 2 AM ac - tophorin ( m ) . ( B ) At various times during spontaneous polymer - ization , actin monomers were added to increase the total actin con - centration to AM and the new rate ofchange of light scattering was recorded . The concentration of filaments was calculated from the increment in the rate ofpolymerization immediately after the addi - tion of fresh monomer , taking into account the free actin monomer concentration . Symbols are the same as in A . erage filament is shorter and the ends are not blocked . The polymer number concentration was roughly proportional to the actophorin concentration ( Fig . 6 B ) , and the number of filaments estimated by this assay was in good agreement with the elongation assay . The number of filaments calculated from the initial rate of depolymerization ( Fig . 6 ) was 0 . 15 nM with 7 . 5 AM actin alone , 0 . 35 nM with 0 . 3 AM actopho - rin , and 1 . 2 nM with 0 . 614M actophorin . Given similar con - centrations of reactants the polymerization assay produced 0 . 5 nM with 5 AM actin , 0 . 8 nM with 0 . 3 AM actophorin , and 1 . 1 nM with 0 . 6 AM actophorin . Although actophorin reduces the concentration of polymer - ized actin ( Fig . 2 ) , this makes only a minor contribution to the dramatic effect of actophorin on the low shear viscosity of actin ( Fig . 7 ; Cooper et al . , 1986 ) . This is further evi - dence that the filaments are shortened by actophorin . The data for Fig . 7 were gathered by varying the concentration of actin or actophorin , but are plotted as a function of the concentration ofpolymerized actin to emphasize that the ap - parent viscosity in the presence of actophorin can be lower by two orders ofmagnitude than expected from the polymer concentration .

( B ) The data shown in A were used to calculate the average length of the filaments taking into account the critical concentration and the actin bound to actophorin assuming a Kd of 0 . 1 AM . No Different Agents That Stabilize Actin Filaments Inhibit the Severing Action ofActophorin We used three different assays to examine the effects ofphal - loidin and inorganic phosphate on the severing of actin fila - ments by actophorin . The acceleration of the late stage of spontaneous polymerization ( Cooper et al . , 1986 ) is a sensi - tive indicator of severing , low shear falling ball viscometry is a sensitive assay for polymer length and light microscopy images severing directly . Phalloidin altered all ofthe effects of actophorin on spon - taneous polymerization in the direction of control samples ( Fig . 8 ) . Alone , phalloidin increased the initial rate of poly - merization and reduced the time taken to reach steady state . Phalloidin with actophorin reduced the late stage accelera - tion , reduced the maxima overshoot , and increased the steady - state polymer concentration , largely eliminating the effects seen with actophorin alone ( Fig . 8 ) . Phalloidin also inhibited the reduction in the low shear viscosity ofpolymer - ized actin caused by actophorin ( Fig . 8 , inset ) . Saturation of the actin filament with rhodamine phalloidin completely prevented severing visualized by fluorescence microscopy . Inorganic phosphate strongly inhibited the ability of ac - tophorin to reduce the viscosity of polymerized actin ( Fig . on A p r il 8 , 2009 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published December 1 , 1991 Figure 6 .

These effects re - quired millimolar concentrations of phosphate with 50 protection at 5 - 10 mM phosphate ( Fig . 9 A ) . In the presence of 25 mM phosphate , 2 AM actophorin had no effect on the critical concentration ofactin ( Fig . 9 D , inset ) , so actophorin may not bind actin under these conditions . Pyrophosphate was not as effective , and sulfate had no effect at a concentra - tion of 25 mM ( Fig . 9 B ) . The evidence reported here strengthens the conclusion that actophorin not only forms a tight 1 : 1 complex with actin monomers but also severs actin filaments . In the following paragraphs we summarize the strengths and weaknesses of possible mechanisms of action of actophorin and compare its properties with those of the other members of its family and those ofthe larger severing proteins .

Actophorin Binds to Actin Monomers Three independent lines of evidence show that actophorin forms a complex with actin monomers that alters the ability of the actin to polymerize . Actophorin can be chemically crosslinked to actin monomers ( Fig . 1 ) . The crosslinking ex - periments suggest that the stoichiometry is 1 : 1 but cannot rule out the binding ofadditional actophorin molecules . The experiments also show that profilin and actophorin compete in some way for binding to an actin molecule . Simple steric interference is the most likely explanation , but conforma - tional changes in the actin cannot be ruled out . Steady - state polymerization experiments provide independent evidence for sequestration of actin monomers in a complex with acto - phorin and the only available information about the binding affinity . The dissociation constant calculated from the effect of actophorin on the polymer concentration is in the range of0 . 1 - 0 . 2 AM , more than 20 times stronger than the affinity of Acanthamoeba profilin for actin ( Lee et al . , 1988 ) . All of the evidence suggests that complexes of actin monomers with actophorin do not participate in the assem - bly of actin filaments . In particular , these complexes do not appear to nucleate actin polymerization like gelsolin and other capping proteins . Other members of the actophorin family also form a 1 : 1 complex with actin . ADF was crosslinked to cysteine 374 on actin through the 5 A sulfhydryl reactive agent N , Np - phenylenedimaleimide forming a stoichiometric complex ( Giuliano et al . , 1988 ) . The Kd of the actinADF complex is 0 . 05 - 0 . 1 AM . Sutoh and Mabuchi ( 1984 , 1989 ) observed the stoichiometric interaction ofdepactin and actin by cross - linking with EDC and similar stoichiometric interactions have been reported for destrin ( Nishida et al . , 1985 ) and an 18 kD ADF - like protein from ascites hepatic cell line ( Ohta et al . , 1984 ) .

Model for severing by actophorin . To display the actin subunits and their postulated contacts we have adopted the ap - proach introduced by Erickson ( 1989 ) . The actin filaments are " un - wound " and projected on a 2 - D plane ( 1 ) . Actin subunits ( triangu - lar shapes ) with bound ATP , ADP with bound Pi and ADP are indicated by T , D - pi , and D , respectively . Subunits within the fila - ment are held by four contacts , two longitudinal and two diagonal . According to this mechanism , thermal motion of the filament re - veals an otherwise buried site close to a longitudinal contact ( 2 ) , an actophorin molecule is then able to bind this site on an actin subunit with bound ADP ( 3 ) . This destabilizes the longitudinal bond , leaving the filament held together by only one longitudinal , and one weak diagonal contact , thus , at this point the filament is more likely to break ( 4 ) than elsewhere . ment for higher affinity binding ofactophorin . Alternatively , the binding site may be fully exposed in filaments but the conformation of assembled actin subunits may reduce their affinity for actophorin . There is no way to distinguish these alternatives at the present time . Proteins related to actopho - rin either bind weakly ( Koffer et al . , 1988 ) or not at all ( Nishida et al . , 1984 ) to actin filaments . There is no evidence that actophorin affects one end of ac - tin filaments preferentially . Actophorin inhibits assembly at both ends ( Cooper et al . , 1986 ) and this can be explained by monomer sequestration alone . There could also be subtle effects on one end , but it is clear that there is not a strong bias in these effects as observed for both the gelsolin group and the fragmin / severin group of severing proteins which tightly cap the barbed ends of filaments . The fact that ac - tophorin prolongs the lag phase of spontaneous polymeriza - tion rather than shortening it , supports the argument that ac - tophorin does not nucleate actin filaments like capping protein ( Cooper and Pollard , 1985 ) . Also , the elongation as - say shows no nucleating activity at early time points . Actophorin SeversActin FYlaments Five different approaches including direct observation by light microscopy have provided evidence that actophorin severs and thereby reduces the length of actin filaments . We have used the technique pioneered by Vale ( 1991 ) for micro - tubules , to directly visualize severing ofactin microfilaments . Other attempts ( Bearer , 1991 ) to demonstrate actophorin - dependent severing inthe light microscope were not success - ful , most probably because stoichiometric labeling of the filaments with rhodamine phalloidin inhibited severing . Light microscopy is the most direct , but the elongation assay ( Fig . 4 ) for measuring polymer number concentration provides the most conclusive quantitative data for severing . Actopho - rin increases the rate at which diluted pyrene - actin filaments The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 115 , 1991 depolymerize , again indicating severing action . Finally , the effects ofactophorin on the electron microscopic appearance of filaments ( Cooper et al . , 1986 ) and on the low shear vis - cosity ( Fig . 8 ) are also consistent with severing . Enhanced nucleation of filaments is an alternative mechanism that could give some of the same results , as observed for Acan - thamoeba capping protein ( Cooper and Pollard , 1985 ) . This is highly unlikely in the case of actophorin , because none of the observations are consistent with nucleation of filaments by actophorin . Furthermore , such a mechanism cannot ac - count for the rapid reduction in length observed when ac - tophorin is mixed with preformed actin filaments . Since the number concentration ofactin filaments is stable for hours in the presence of actophorin and since short actin filaments at these concentrations rapidly anneal ( Murphy et al . , 1988 ) , the actophorin must either sever actin filaments at steady state or block annealing . Neither mechanism can be ruled out , but we favor continuous severing , since the pro - teins that block annealing are generally strong capping pro - teins and would be expected to cosediment with actin . Mechanism ofActin Fllament Severing We hypothesize that the most likely severing mechanism is that actophorin destabilizes filaments by intercalating be - tween subunits ( Fig . 10 ) . The mechanism is based on the large difference in the affinity and / or the number of actopho - rin binding sites ofmonomeric and polymeric actin . We sug - gest that the actophorin binding sites of subunits is partially buried but can be exposed rarely by thermal distortion or strain in the bonds between subunits in filaments . The higher frequency of severing at preexisting bends in actin ( Fig . 3 ) supports this hypothesis . Actophorin binds to actin mono - mers with about the same affinity as the actin subunits have for the end of a filament , so with an intercalated actophorin ( 1989 ) , the probability of polymer breakage would be much higher at the site of intercalation than elsewhere along the polymer . The validity of the intercalation hypothesis should be tested rigorously by the structural studies of actophorin that are now in progress ( Magnus et al . , 1989 ) . Depactin can be crosslinked to both NH2 - and COOH - terminal peptides of actin ( Mabuchi and Sutoh , 1984 , 1989 ) and ADF can be crosslinked to cys374 ( Guiliano et al . , 1988 ) . This places part of the binding site for this class of proteins at the barbed end of the actin molecule ( Kabsch et al . , 1990 ) on the outer surface of the filament near the longitudinal bonds of the long - pitch helix ( Holmes et al . , 1990 ) . The structure of ac - tophorin and the identity ofthe actin and actophorin residues crosslinked by EDC should reveal whether part of the ac - tophorin binding site is usually buried within the filament . Gelsolin ( and fragmin / severin ) may use a different mecha - nism to sever actin filaments . Gelsolin is a more potent severing protein than actophorin , requires Cat + , caps the severed end , and nucleates actin polymerization . Although studied in less detail , fragmin and severin appear to have similar properties . The severing mechanism is not fully un - derstood , but plausible models , based on studies ofdomains produced by proteolysis ( Kwiatkowski et al . , 1985 ; Bryan and Hwo , 1986 ) or by expression of recombinant cDNAs ( Kwiatkowski et al . , 1989 ; Way et al . , 1989 ) propose that all six domains ofthe 82 - kD protein collaborate in the severing process by encompassing the entire circumference ofthe fila - 1618 on A p r il 8 , 2009 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published December 1 , 1991 ment . Weak severing ability remains in a small gelsolin frag - ment which may function in a manner similar to that of the actophorin group . Stabilizing Agents ProtectActin Filamentsfrom Severing by Actophorin The proposed intercalation mechanism is consistent with protection of the filaments by phalloidin . Phalloidin stabi - lizes actin filaments against a variety of disruptive agents , as well as spontaneous fragmentation ( Estes et al . , 1981 ) . By reducing the likelihood ofintercalation sites , they could also protect filaments from actophorin . Phalloidin also inhibits severing by fragmin ( Hinssen , 1981 ) . Tropomyosins inhibit the severing of filaments by gelsolin , ( Ishikawa et al . , 1989 ) , fragmin ( Hinssen , 1981 ) , villin ( Burgess et al . , 1987 ) , and ADF ( Bernstein and Bamburg , 1982 ) . Phosphate Is aPbiential PhysiologicalRegulator of Severing byActophorin Millimolar concentrations of phosphate inhibit the binding of actin to actophorin and severing of actin filaments by ac - tophorin . This is the concentration range required for phos - phate binding to a low affinity site on polymerized actin subunits with bound ADP ( Carlier and Pantaloni , 1988 ) . Since binding ofphosphate to these sites causes the polymer to behave much like filaments with ATP bound to each subunit ( Rickard and Sheterline , 1986 ) , it is generally thought to represent the reformation of the actin - ADP - Pi in - termediate that forms transiently during the assembly offila - ments from actinATP monomers ( Carlier and Pantaloni , 1988 ) . Since subunits newly incorporated into actin fila - ments are largely the actin - ADP - Pi intermediate that forms transiently during the assembly of filaments from actin - ATP monomers ( Carlier and Pantaloni , 1988 ) , rapidly growing filaments should be much less susceptible to severing by ac - tophorin than older filaments , unless the cytoplasmic con - centration of phosphate is greater than ti5 mM , when all filaments should be resistant . Interpretation ofthe Effects ofActophorin on Spontaneous Pblymerization It is remarkable that a protein , which sequesters actin monomers and which reduces the length of actin filaments 10 - fold by severing , has only a subtle effect on the time course of spontaneous polymerization ( Figs . 4 , 8 , and 9 ) . In bulk samples there is little effect on the initial lag but the rate of polymerization increases late in the reaction . We believe that the sum of several antagonistic reactions can explain the observations . The reactions are the formation of the actin monomer / actophorin complex , the severing of actin fila - ments by actophorin , and the normal actin polymerization reactions including nucleation , elongation , ATP hydrolysis , and Pi dissociation . Under the initial conditions used in our experiments ( micromolar concentrations of actophorin with an excess of actin monomers ) , much of the actophorin and part of the ac - tin are tied up in complexes . This reduces the concentration of free actophorin available for severing filaments and minimizes the apparent severing activity . Furthermore , the sequestration of actin in these complexes should retard poly - Maciver et al . Actin Filament Severing by Acanthamoeba Actophorin merization , especially since nucleation is so dependent on the actin monomer concentration . Unexpectedly , actophorin has only a small effect on the initial lag . This result can only be explained by a higher concentration of polymer ends in the presence of actophorin ; the increase in ends just offsets the inhibition of nucleation and elongation by sequestration ofmonomers ! This interpretation is confirmed by the elonga - tion assay ( Fig . 4 B ) showing that the polymer number con - centration in the presence of 1 AM actophorin was higher than controls as early as 2 . 5 min after the initiation of poly - merization when only 6 % ofthe free actin had polymerized ( Fig . 4 A ) . This difference in polymer number concentration can be explained by severing . It is calculated that at this early stage in the polymerization process the mean length of the filaments in the presence of 1 AM actophorin is 1 . 6 Am , how - ever , because of the large amount of monomeric actin pres - ent , only 0 . 21 AM actophorin is expected to be uncomplexed and so presumably able to sever . Another possible explana - tion is that actophorin can efficiently sever filaments only above a certain length . After the lag phase , the bulk polymerization rate with ac - tophorin exceeds the control in spite ofthe monomer seques - tration , due to the high concentration offilaments . We attrib - ute this to severing . We cannot yet explain the " overshoot " in polymer concentration prior to attaining steady state , but note that others have observed similar overshoots in stirred or disrupted samples ( Cooper and Pollard , 1982 ; Cerven , 1987 ) . At steady state the polymer concentration is less than controls due to sequestration of monomers in a non - polymerizable complex with actophorin .
