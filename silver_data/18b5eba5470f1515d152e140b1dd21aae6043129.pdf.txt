In wild type embryos the Cxcr4b receptor is uniformly distributed on the migrating PGC membrane , and its turnover is uniform around the cell circumference . ( A ) A graph showing the Cxcr4b - GFP protein level measured at the front and the back ( normalized to the mCherry - F’ ) of individual migrating PGCs under conditions of endogenous Cxcl12a distribution in the embryo ( A , n = 18 ) . A representative cell is shown , with the areas defined as front and back indicated by lines and the arrows designate the migration direction . Scale bars signify 10 μ m .

Functionality of the Cxcr4b tandem fluorescent timer ( tft ) in the context of PGC migration . ( A ) Schematic representation of the cxcr4b tft RNA , showing the cxcr4b open reading frame cloned upstream to the slow maturing mCherry and to the fast maturing sfGFP , followed by nanos3 ′ UTR that drives preferential expression of the protein within the PGCs . The Red to Green intensity ratio reflects the protein age such that the higher the ratio , the more mature the protein is . ( B ) The Cxcr4b tft protein can guide PGCs to their target in embryos lacking functional Cxcr4b ( ody − / − ) . Arrowheads point at PGCs found in ectopic positions in 24 hr post fertilisation ( hpf ) ody − / − mutants ( left panel ) and at the target position following introduction of cxcr4b tft RNA ( right panel ) . ( C ) The Cxcr4b tft protein expressed in PGCs is internalized upon exposure to Cxcl12a ( right panel ) . The functionality of the Cxcr4b tandem fluorescent timer ( tft ) is evidenced by the fact that despite the uniform distribution of Cxcr4b on the cell membrane ( D , n = 14 ) , cells located within an artificially - generated steep Cxcl12a gradient exhibit reduced age at their cell front ( E , n = 18 ) .

Regulation of dynamic filopodia at the cell front and their role in cell polarization and directed cell migration . Following the activation of Cxcr4b by Cxcl12a ( 1 ) , the scaffold protein Irsp53 is activated ( 2 ) and promotes the formation of dynamic filopodia at the cell front ( 3 ) . The dynamic filopodia that extend in the direction of higher Cxcl12a concentration increase the surface for chemokine binding ( 4 ) , thereby enhancing signalling . The enhanced signalling at the cell front results in further Irsp53 activation ( 5 ) and an elevation of pH ( 6 ) . The increase in pH in turn , leads to an elevation in Rac1 activity at this aspect of the cell ( 7 ) . Once established , the front inhibits other parts of the cell from assuming front characteristics including dynamic filopodia formation , elevated pH and Rac1 activation ( 8 ) . Lower panels—Irsp53 inhibition or Afap1L1a overexpression result in loss of dynamic filopodia at the cell front , abrogating the local increase in pH . As a consequence , PGCs migrate less directionally . Lack of a Cxcl12a gradient leads to the formation of numerous , evenly distributed , long and persistent filopodia in cells that migrate in random directions .
