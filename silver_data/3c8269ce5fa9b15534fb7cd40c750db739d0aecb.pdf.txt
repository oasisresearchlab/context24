In contrast to other models , plant endocytosis is 23 independent of actin , indicating a mechanistically distinct solution . Here , by using biochemical 24 and advanced microscopy approaches , we show that the plant - specific TPLATE complex acts 25 outside of endocytic vesicles as a mediator of membrane bending . Cells with disrupted 26 TPLATE fail to generate spherical vesicles , and in vitro biophysical assays identified protein 27 domains with membrane bending capability . These results redefine the role of the TPLATE 28 complex as a key component of the evolutionarily distinct mechanism mediating membrane 29 bending against high turgor pressure to drive endocytosis in plant cells . 30 Main Text 31 Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is a critical eukaryotic cellular process that regulates a 32 wide range of physiological processes , for example , mediating the internalization of receptors 33 and transporters ( 1 ) . During CME , a small area of the plasma membrane ( PM ) invaginates into 34 the cell forming a spherical vesicle against intracellular forces that oppose membrane 35 deformation , like turgor pressure . The mechanisms driving this process in mammalian and 36 yeast systems have been the subject of extensive study for the better part of 5 decades , which 37 has led to the identification of key proteins that provide the force required to overcome these 38 forces ( 2 , 3 ) . Critically , actin has been established to be essential for membrane bending in 39 systems with high turgor pressures ( 2 , 4 ) . In stark contrast , plant CME characterization is in its 40 infancy . Indeed , it had been postulated for many years that due to the extreme levels of turgor 41 pressure in plants , CME was physically impossible in most plant cells ( 5 ) . However , while it 42 is now well established that CME does occur in planta , and plays key developmental and 43 physiological roles ( 6 ) , the machinery and mechanisms that drive CME against the unique 44 biophysical properties of plant cells are yet to be clearly identified . For example , it had long 45 been thought that plant CME relies on actin to overcome the extreme turgor pressure , however 46 it has recently been demonstrated that plant CME is independent of actin , highlighting that 47 plants have evolved a distinct solution to bending membranes against high turgor pressures ( 7 ) . 48 A further mechanistic divergence of plant CME is manifested by the presence of the octameric 49 TPLATE complex ( TPC ) , where all 8 members share the same localizations and dynamics at 50 sites of plant CME , and is essential for both CME and plant survival ( 8 , 9 ) . While this complex 51 is conserved in some biological systems , for example Dictyostelium , it is notably absent from 52 mammalian and yeast genomes ( 8 , 10 , 11 ) . Based on static interaction and localization data , 53 the TPC has been proposed to be a classical endocytosis adaptor protein ; chiefly acting to bind 54 cargo in the clathrin - coated vesicle ( CCV ) , driving the coat assembly , and has thus been 55 predicted to localize beneath the clathrin coat ( 8 , 12 ) . 56 However , recent total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( TIRF - M ) of CME 57 events in planta suggested that once the endocytic CCV departs from the PM , TPLATE 58 dissociates from the CCV prior to the loss of clathrin ( 7 ) . This did not support the proposed 59 adaptor functions of TPLATE , which , as assumed to be localized under the clathrin coat , should 60 have an equivalent / slower dissociation relative to clathrin . Furthermore , the classical adaptor , 61 AP2 , and TPLATE have different dynamics at co - localized foci on the PM ( 8 ) . To further 62 assess and quantify the dissociation of TPLATE from the CCV , we analyzed CME events 63 marked with Clathrin light - chain 2 ( CLC2 - tagRFP ) and TPLATE - GFP obtained using a 64 spinning disk microscope equipped with a sample cooling stage ( Fig . 1A ) ( 9 ) . As this imaging 65 modality provides an increase in the illumination volume of the cytoplasm compared to TIRF - 66 M , and cooling the sample slowed the dynamics of cellular processes ( 9 ) , it allowed a more 67 precise visualization of the dissociation sequence of proteins from the CCV once it is freed 68 from the PM ( Fig . S1A ) . This resulted in kymographs of individual CME events with a visible 69 lateral divergence of fluorescence signals at the end of the CME events ( Fig . 1B ) , which 70 represent the movement of CCVs once departed from the PM . These ‘departure traces’ were 71 analyzed to establish the sequence of TPLATE and CLC2 dissociation . We found that the 72 significant majority of visible departure traces displayed differential dissociation of these 73 proteins ; critically where TPLATE departed the CCV before CLC2 ( Fig 1C . , Fig S1B . ) . This 74 argued against the model that TPC is entrapped within the clathrin coat of the CCV . To further 75 query the nature of the association of the TPC with CCVs , we performed western blot analysis 76 of purified CCV preparations from plant cells . While we found an enrichment of the clathrin 77 isoforms and the canonical adaptor AP2 in the purified CCV fraction , TPLATE was not 78 enriched ( Fig 1C - D ) . The depletion of TPLATE was observed in parallel with a similar lack of 79 enrichment of dynamin related protein 1c ( DRP1c ) , which functions outside the CCV ( 13 ) . 80 Together , this demonstrates that TPLATE is more loosely associated with CCVs than clathrin 81 coat proteins and not incorporated within CCV structures as previously predicted . 82 To precisely determine the localization of TPLATE at CME events we used structured 83 illumination microscopy ( SIM ) to examine live plants expressing TPLATE - GFP and CLC2 - 84 TagRFP . We observed that TPLATE , in addition to presenting as individual foci , often 85 appeared as crescent shaped or ring structures ( Fig . 2A and Fig . S2A ) . This was in contrast to 86 CLC2 , which was always found as discrete foci on the PM or large structures representing 87 trans - Golgi / early endosomes ( 7 ) . We found that ~ 68 % of TPLATE co - localized with CLC2 88 foci , agreeing with previously published results ( 8 ) . Upon closer inspection of the super 89 resolved co - localized events , we found that ~ 17 % of co - localization events showed that 90 TPLATE formed a ring or crescent around the CLC2 foci whereas the inverse arrangement was 91 never observed , suggesting that TPLATE localizes outside of the clathrin coat assembly during 92 CME . In further support of this , when we examined plants expressing TPLATE - GFP and 93 AP2A1 - tagRFP we found a similar pattern , where ~ 18 % of colocalized events showed 94 TPLATE surrounding AP2 in ring and crescent patterns ( Fig . S2A ) . To gain further insight into 95 the TPLATE ring arrangements , we visualized the dynamics of TPLATE on the PM using 96 TIRF - SIM . We observed that TPLATE first appeared as a spot , and over time form a ring , 97 which then closed back to a spot before disappearing ( Fig . 2C and Movie 1 ) . This suggests that 98 at the beginning of the CME event , TPLATE and clathrin are both present in an area below the 99 resolution of SIM , but as the CCV grows in diameter ( above the resolution limit ) , TPLATE is 100 excluded from the invaginating CCV coat formation and is localized at the rim around the 101 CCV . This confirms that TPLATE is localized at the periphery of CCV events , rather than 102 within the invaginating clathrin coat . 103 In mammalian and yeast CME , the endocytic proteins which are localized at the rim of 104 the CME events are implicated in membrane bending , for example Eps15 / Ede1 , Epsin and 105 Fcho / Syp1 ( 14 - 17 ) . Therefore , based on the spatial and temporal profile of TPLATE , and the 106 ability of distinct domains of TPC to bind directly to the PM ( 18 , 19 ) , we hypothesize that 107 components of the TPC are critical for membrane bending during plant CME . To test this 108 notion , we looked directly at CCVs in plant cells subjected to TPC disruption . For these studies , 109 we used the inducible TPLATE loss - of - function mutant WDXM2 ; where tplate mutant plants 110 are complemented with a genetically destabilized version of TPLATE that after heat shock 111 results in the total aggregation of TPLATE away from the PM and blocks CME ( 20 ) . First , we 112 further confirmed that the heat shock treatment had no significant effect on the efficiency and 113 kinetics of CME in plants by examining FM4 - 64 uptake and the dynamics of single CME 114 events ( Fig . S3 ) . To achieve the spatial resolution required to look at the shape of individual 115 CCVs , we used scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) to examine metal replicas of unroofed 116 protoplasts made directly from wild type or WDXM2 roots . Under control conditions in 117 WDXM2 cells , we observed that the majority of clathrin structures were spherical ( i . e . , fully 118 invaginated CCVs ) . In contrast , in cells in which the TPC was disrupted , we observed many 119 flat clathrin structures ( Fig . 3A ) , which were never observed in control conditions . To quantify 120 the effect of TPC disruption , we determined the shape of the clathrin structures by measuring 121 the area and average intensity ( a proxy for CCV curvature ( Fig . S4A ) ( 21 ) ) of each clathrin 122 structure visualized and classified these shapes into 4 categories ; ‘small and round’ ( the fully 123 invaginated CCVs ) , ‘small and flat’ ( where curvature generation had failed ) , ‘large and round’ , 124 and ‘large and flat’ ( clathrin plaques ) ( Fig . 3C ) . We found that the heat shock had no effect 125 upon CCV formation in wild type cells ( Fig . S4B and Fig . 3D ) , where the majority of clathrin 126 structures were found as ‘small and round’ ( 87 - 96 % ) . This population in WDXM2 cells under 127 control conditions was 86 % , but following TPC disruption , this decreased to 24 % and the 128 ‘small and flat’ population increased to 58 % ( compared to < 7 % in all other tested conditions ) . 129 These results indicated that the TPC is required to generate curved clathrin structures . 130 To further confirm this , we directly examined the 3 - dimentional shape of clathrin 131 structures in WDXM2 cells incubated at either control or TPC disruptive conditions using 132 scanning transmission electron microscopy ( STEM ) tomography ( Fig . 3E ) . Under conditions 133 that disrupted TPC function , the curvature of clathrin structures did not exceed 10 nm , whereas 134 under control conditions , the clathrin structures were spherical with Z heights > 50 nm ( Fig . 135 3E and Movie S2 - S3 ) . Together , these ultrastructural examinations of clathrin structures 136 demonstrate that the TPC is required to generate spherical CCVs . 137 Given this strong phenotype of flattened clathrin structures during TPLATE disruption , 138 we looked for protein domains within the TPC which could mediate membrane bending . The 139 plant - specific members of the TPC , AtEH1 / Pan1 and AtEH2 / Pan1 , each contain 2 Eps15 140 homology domains ( EH ) which are also present in proteins which localize at the rim of CME 141 events and known to have membrane bending activity in other systems ( e . g . , Eps15 / Ede1 and 142 Intersectin / Pan1 ) ( 12 , 15 - 17 ) ) . As the EH domains of Eps15 have been shown to tubulate 143 membranes in vitro ( 17 ) , and the EH domains of AtEH1 / Pan1 have been shown to bind 144 membranes ( 18 ) , we therefore tested their ability to bend membranes . To do this , we incubated 145 large unilamellar liposomes ( LUVs ) with the purified EH domains of AtEH1 / Pan1 , and 146 analysis by transmission electron microscopy revealed that after 2 and 30 minutes , both EH 147 domains produced significant levels of membrane ruffling and longer tubules of vesiculated 148 membrane compared to control treatments ( Fig . 4 and Fig . S5 ) . This demonstrated that 149 AtEH1 / Pan1 has the capacity to contribute to membrane bending . However , as AtEH1 / Pan1 150 remains associated with the PM during WDXM2 disruption ( 20 ) , but is not sufficient to 151 generate the invagination ( Fig . 3 ) , it suggests that additional factors are required to modulate 152 the membrane bending activity of the AtEH1 / Pan1 EH domains . This is similar to Eps15 , 153 where the isolated EH domains can deform membranes while the full - length protein requires 154 the co - factor FCHo ( 17 ) . Interestingly , the Eps15 and FCHo interaction is mediated by the µ - 155 homology domain ( HD ) domain within Fcho ( 22 ) , which is similar to the interactions within 156 the TPC , as the TML µ - HD domain interacts with AtEH1 / Pan1 ( 12 , 18 ) . Although not 157 experimentally addressed yet in the context of WDXM2 , the failure to generate spherical CCVs 158 despite AtEH / Pan1 remaining on the PM might point to the necessity of TML to also localize 159 on the PM and likely implicates it as co - factor in plant membrane bending . Furthermore , as the 160 µ - HD domain is absent from the TPC homologous TSET complex in Dictyostelium , which also 161 lacks the AtEH / Pan1 proteins ( 11 , 19 ) , it suggests a potential functional divergence between 162 the plant TPC and the Dictyostelium TSET complex , where CME is also mechanistically 163 distinct ; as in contrast to plant CME , Dictyostelium CME is coupled with actin ( 23 ) . 164 Overall , this study provides crucial insights into the long - standing question how 165 endocytic vesicles can be formed by PM invaginations against the high turgor pressure of plant 166 cells . This mystery has been used previously as a main argument against the existence of 167 efficient endocytosis in plants and has been reinforced by the recent demonstration that , in 168 contrast to yeast , plants do not use actin cytoskeleton to generate the necessary force for this 169 process ( 7 ) . Using a range of biochemistry , advanced high - , super - and ultra - resolution 170 microscopy and in vitro reconstitution assays , we redefined the role of the plant - specific TPC , 171 which has been thought to act as adaptor inside of the coat of the forming endocytic vesicles . 172 Instead , we show that the TPC localizes outside of CCVs and is essential for membrane 173 bending and endocytic vesicle formation ( Fig . S6 ) . This provides further evidence for the 174 evolutionary distinct mechanism of how endocytosis operates in plants . 175 Material and Methods 176 Plant Materials 177 Arabidopsis thaliana accession codes for genes used in this study ; AP2A1 ( AT5G22770 ) , 178 CLC2 ( AT2G40060 ) , TPLATE ( AT3G01780 ) and AtEH1 / Pan1 ( AT1G20760 ) . Transgenic 179 Arabidopsis thaliana plants used in this study were tplate pLAT52p : : TPLATE - GFP x 180 pRPS5A : : CLC2 - tagRFP , pLAT52p : : TPLATE - GFP x pRPS5A : : AP2A1 - TagRFP ( 8 ) and 181 tplate pLAT52 : : WDXM2 - GFP ( 20 ) . 182 Growth Conditions 183 Plants are grown by plating seeds on to ½ AM agar plates with 1 % ( w / v ) sucrose , stratified for 184 2 - 3 days in the dark at 4°C , then transferred to growth rooms ( 21°C , 16 hours light , 8 hours 185 dark ) and grown vertically for 4 , 5 or 7 days as detailed below . 186 Departure Analysis of EAPs from CCVs 187 Raw data from Wang et al . ( 9 ) was analyzed to determine the departure dynamics of the 188 endocytosis proteins . Briefly , spinning disk microscopy was conducted on 4 - day old epidermal 189 cells of etiolated hypocotyls were imaged with a Nikon Ti microscope equipped with a 190 Ultraview spinning - disk system ( Perkin - Elmer ) , a Plan Apo 100x 1 . 45 NA oil immersion 191 objective and a CherryTemp system ( Cherry Biotech ) to apply the experimental temperature 192 conditions ; either room temperature ( 25°C ) or 12 °C . Time lapses were collected at a frame 193 rate of 1 frame per 1 . 174s . The 12°C time - lapses of TPLATE - GFP and CLC2 - TagRFP samples 194 were subjected to histogram matching bleach correction and then dynamically re - sliced to 195 produce kymographs in Fiji ( 24 ) . The CLC2 channel was manually screened to identify 196 kymograph traces with a visible departure track . These selected traces were then examined to 197 compare the departure of both channels and categized as illustrated in Fig . S1 . 198 Western blotting analysis of CCV purification 199 CCVs were purified from suspension cultured Arabidopsis T87W cells as previously described 200 ( 25 ) . Equal amounts of protein from the deuterium ficoll gradient load ( DFGL ) and purified 201 clathrin coated vesicle ( CCV ) samples were separated by SDS - PAGE , transferred to 202 nitrocellulose membrane , and immunoblotted with anti - CLC2 1 : 10 , 000 ( 26 ) , anti - CHC 1 : 1 , 000 203 ( sc - 57684 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , anti - AP2mu2 1 : 250 ( 27 ) , anti - TPLATE 1 : 2000 ( 28 ) , 204 and anti - DRP1c 1 : 500 ( 29 ) antibodies . Primary antibodies were detected through anti - rabbit or 205 anti - mouse secondary antibodies ( Sigma Aldrich ) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase at 206 1 : 5 , 000 before application of SuperSignal West Femto enhanced chemiluminescent ( ECL ) 207 substrate ( ThermoFisher ) and subsequent imaging with iBright CL1000 Imaging System 208 ( ThermoFisher ) . The integrated density values of the chemiluminescent bands of the DFGL 209 and CCV fractions were measured by ImageJ ( NIH ) . The integrated density value of the CCV 210 band was divided by the corresponding value of the DFGL band to determine the relative 211 enrichment across three independent CCV purifications . 212 FM uptake and TIRF - M imaging and analysis 213 A Zeiss LSM - 800 confocal microscope was to examine the effect of FM4 - 64 uptake in 5 - day 214 old Col - 0 seedlings . Seedlings were incubated for 6 hours at either room temperature or 35°C 215 for six hours and then incubated with 2 µM FM4 - 64 in AM + media for 5 minutes , washed 216 twice in ½ MS and 1 % sucrose media and imaged and analyzed as specified previously ( 30 ) . 217 A 40x water immersion objected was used . 218 Total internal reflective fluorescence microscopy ( TIRF - M ) experiments made use of 219 an Olympus IX83 inverted microscope equipped with a Cell ^ TIRF module using an 220 OLYMPUS Uapo N 100x / 1 . 49 Oil TIRF objective . 7 - day old seedlings were incubated at either 221 25°C or 37°C for 6 hours prior to imaging . Root epidermal cells were imaged and analyzed as 222 described previously ( 30 ) ; this provided unbiased lifetimes , densities and fluorescence profiles 223 of endocytosis proteins in samples subjected to the experimental temperature conditions . 224 Super - resolution localization of EAPs 225 Structured illumination microscopy ( SIM ) was conducted on 7 - day old seedlings expressing 226 TPLATE - GFP or AP2A1 - GFP and CLC2 - TagRFP . Root samples were prepared as described 227 previously ( 30 ) , but high - precision 1 . 5 coverslips were used ( Thorlabs , # CG15CH ) , and 228 epidermal cells in the elongation zone were selected for imaging . For 3D - SIM , an OMX 229 BLAZE v4 SIM ( Applied Precision ) was used . For TIRF - SIM , an OMX SR ( GE Healthcare ) 230 was used . Both are equipped with a 60 × 1 . 42 NA oil immersion objective , and 100 mw 488 231 nm and 561 nm lasers were used for illumination ( for TPLATE - GFP x CLC2 - TagRFP , 488 232 laser powers ranged from ; 488 , 30 - 100 % ; 561 , 25 - 100 % . For TPLATE - GFP x AP2A1 - 233 TagRFP , laser powers ranged from ; 488 , 20 - 100 % ; 561 , 40 - 100 % ) . Images were reconstructed 234 using SOFTWORX ( GE Healthcare ) and further processed in Fiji ( 24 ) . 235 The co - localization rate was determined by using ComDet 236 ( https : / / github . com / ekatrukha / ComDet ) , where co - localization was determined positive if spot 237 detection were less than 4 pixels apart . This method uses wavelet decomposition to determine 238 spot detection , thus considers rings and spots extremely close together as a single spot . To 239 determine the pattern of localization of TPLATE , i . e . , if it is a spot or surrounding the CME 240 event , spots were manually examined and scored if TPLATE presented as a crescent or ring 241 around a CLC2 or AP2A1 spot . 242 Ultra - structural examination of CCVs by SEM and EM tomography from metal replicas of 243 protoplasts made directly from roots 244 Densely sown Col - 0 or WDXM2 - GFP plants were grown for 8 - 10 days . The roots were cut 245 into small ~ 1 - 2 mm fragment directly in to ‘Enzyme solution’ ( 0 . 4 M Mannitol , 20 mM KCl , 246 20 mM MES pH 5 . 7 , 1 . 5 % Cellulase R10 ( Yakult ) , 0 . 4 % Macerozyme R10 ( Yakult ) in H 2 0 ) . 247 The cuttings and enzyme solution were placed into a vacuum chamber for 20 mins and then 248 subjected to a 3 - hour incubation at room temperature , in the dark , and with gentle agitation . 249 The cells were then centrifuged at 100 rcf for 2 mins , and the pellet washed with ‘W5 buffer’ 250 ( 154 mM NaCl , 125 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM KCL , 2mM MES ) by centrifugation ( 100 rcf for 2 251 mins ) . The cells were then resuspended in W5 buffer and incubated at 4°C for 30 mins . The 252 sample was again centrifuged at 100 rcf for 2 mins , and the cells were resuspended in 253 ‘hyperosmotic GM buffer’ ( GM ; 0 . 44 % ( w / v ) Murashige and Skoog ( MS ) powder with 254 vitamins ( Duchefa Biochemie ) , 89 mM Sucrose , 75 mM mannitol , pH 5 . 5 adjusted with KOH ) 255 and then plated on precleaned ( washed in pure ethanol and sonicated ) , carbon ( 10 nm thickness ) 256 and poly - l - lysine ( Sigma ) coated coverslips . Samples were incubated at room temperature in 257 the dark for 30 mins , and then subjected to a 4 - hour incubation in the dark at either room 258 temperature or 37°C . Samples were then unroofed as described previously ( 30 ) , with the 259 buffers were equilibrated to either room temperature or 37°C . Samples for SEM analysis were 260 attached to SEM mounts using sticky carbon tape and coated with platinum to a thickness of 3 261 nm , whereas samples for STEM were attached to a sticky Post - It - Note ( as described in ( 31 ) ) 262 and coated with 3 nm platinum and 4 nm carbon using an ACE600 coating device ( Leica 263 Microsystems ) . The STEM samples were then washed with Buffered Oxide Etchant ( diluted 264 6 : 1 with surfactant ) to separate the metal replica from the coverslip , washed with distilled 265 water , and remounted on formvar / carbon - coated 200 - line bar EM grids ( Science Services ) . 266 The SEM samples were then imaged with an FE - SEM Merlin Compact VP ( Zeiss ) and 267 imaged with an In - lens Duo detector ( SE and BSE imaging ) at an accelerating voltage of 3 - 5 268 kV . The area and mean grey value of clathrin - coated structures ( CCSs ) was measured using 269 Fiji ( 24 ) , where ROIs were manually draw around each CCS . To estimate the curvature of the 270 CCSs , the mean CCS ROI was divided by the average grey value of the PM ( as determined by 271 the mean grey value of 4 PM ROIs in each corner of each image ) . From these two values , the 272 morphology of the CCS could be determined by using thresholds and divided into categories , 273 as described by Moulay et al . , ( 21 ) . We used an area threshold of 8500 mm 2 ( which is derived 274 from a diameter of 105 nm ) to determine if the CCS was small or large , and a curvature value 275 of 1 . 25 ( determined by measuring the mean grey value of the large CCSs observed in TPC 276 disruption conditions ) to determine if the CCS was round or flat . Pooled data from multiple 277 experiments were plotted and the percentage of CCVs in each category was calculated . 278 STEM Tomograms were recorded using a JEOL JEM2800 scanning / transmission 279 electron microscope ( 200kV ) . Each CCV was imaged at over a range of - 72° to 72° , with 4° 280 steps driven by STEM Meister ( TEMography . com ) . Tomograms were then processed and 3D 281 reconstructions were made using Composer and Evo - viewer ( TEMography . com ) . To examine 282 the curvature , 3D reconstructions were rotated 90° and their profiles were manually traced in 283 Adobe Illustrator . 284 Expression and purification of AtEH / Pan1 EH domains 285 The two EH domains of atEH1 , EH1 . 1 and EH1 . 2 as defined by ( 18 ) , were amplified from 286 synthetic AtEH1 / Pan1 ( codon optimized for bacterial expression , IDT ) ( Supplemental Table 287 1 ) and inserted into pET - TwinStrep - TEV - G4 . They were then expressed in E . coli BL21 cells 288 and grown at 37ºC in Lysogeny Broth medium ( pH 7 . 0 ) supplemented with 50 µg ml - 1 289 kanamycin . Protein expression was induced at an OD600 of 0 . 6 with 1 mM isopropyl - β - 290 thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) and incubated for 5 h at 37°C . Cultures were centrifuged at 5000 291 g for 30 min at 4ºC , and pellets were resuspended in 50 mL Phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) 292 buffer . They were then centrifuged at 4700 g for 30 min at 4ºC and then pellets were frozen 293 and stored at −80°C until further processing . 294 The pellets were resuspended for 1 hour at 4ºC with gentle mixing in buffer A ( 20 mM 295 HEPES ( pH7 . 4 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 2 mM CaCl2 , as described by ( 18 ) ) with supplemented 296 ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) - free protease inhibitor cocktail tablets ( Roche 297 Diagnostics ) , 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ( PMSF ) , 1 mg mL - 1 lysozyme , 1 µg ml - 1 298 DNase I . Cells were lysed by sonication ( Qsonica Q700 ) and centrifuged at 67000 g for 1 h at 299 4 ºC . The clarified lysate was incubated with Streptactin sepharose resin ( Strep - Tactin® 300 Sepharose® resin ; iba ) for 1 hour at 4°C . The resin was washed with 40 bed volumes of buffer 301 A and the fusion protein was eluted with buffer A containing 5 mM d - Desthiobiotin ( Sigma - 302 Algrich ) . Peak atEH domain fractions were dialyzed overnight at 4°C against buffer A in the 303 presence of TwinStrep - tagged TEV protease ( 32 ) at a protease - to - sample molar ratio of 1 : 100 . 304 After centrifugation ( 21 140 xg for 10 min at 4 °C ) , the supernatant was applied to a HiLoad 305 16 / 600 Superdex 75 pg column , pre - equilibrated with buffer A , using a fast protein liquid 306 chromatography system . Protein was eluted with buffer A and stored in aliquots at −80 °C . The 307 protein sequences of the EH domains were verified by MS analysis . 308 Liposome tubulation assay 309 LUVs were prepared using a mixture of 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phospho - ( 1 ' - rac - 310 glycerol ) ( DOPC ) , 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phospho - L - serine ( DOPS ) , cholesterol ( plant ) 311 and 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phospho - ( 1 ' - myo - inositol - 4 ' , 5 ' - bisphosphate ) ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) 312 ( Avanti ) at a ratio of 60 : 17 . 5 : 20 : 2 , 5 mol % was used . Lipids were mixed in a glass vial at the 313 desired ratio , blow - dried with filtered N2 to form a thin homogeneous film and kept under 314 vacuum for 2 – 3 h . The lipid film was rehydrated in a swelling buffer ( 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 315 150 mM NaCl ) for 10 min at room temperature to a total lipid concentration of 2 mM . The 316 mixture was vortexed rigorously and the resulting dispersion of multilamellar vesicles was 317 repeatedly freeze – thawed ( 5 – 6 times ) in liquid N2 . The mixture was extruded through a 318 polycarbonate membrane with pore size 400 nm ( LiposoFast Liposome Factory ) . LUVs were 319 stored at 4 °C and used within 4 days . To assay the membrane bending activity of proteins of 320 interest upon the LUVs , 10 µM of the protein of interest was mixed with 0 . 5 mM of LUVs in 321 swelling buffer and incubated for 2 , or 30 , minutes at room temperature . Control LUVs were 322 diluted to a concentration of 0 . 5 mM in swelling buffer and incubated for 1 hour at room 323 temperature . 20 ul of the experimental solutions were incubated on glow - discharged to carbon - 324 coated copper EM grids ( 300 mesh , EMS ) . Filter paper was used to remove any excess solution 325 and the EM samples were then washed three times with swelling buffer . They were then 326 negatively stained with 2 % uranyl acetate aqueous solution for 2 mins and observed under a 327 Tecnai 12 transmission electron microscope operated at 120 kV ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . 328 The number of tubulated and non - tubulated liposomes was counted manually using Fiji ( 24 ) 329 from multiple experiments . 330 References 331 1 .

Classification of departure events 478 Related to figure 1 . 479 A ) During CME , as the CCV invaginates on the PM it is restricted in movement in X and Y . 480 This means in a kymograph it will present a linear pattern . However , once it is freed from the 481 PM ( gray dotted line ) , it trafficks away from the PM and thus is able to move in all directions , 482 resulting in a lateral movement in the kymograph trace . Notably , this also results in the CCV 483 moving deeper into the cell and exiting the illumination volume of fluorescence imaging 484 methods , which determine how long the CCV is visible once after being cut from the PM and 485 thus how long the departure trace is on a kymograph . TIRF - M has a Z depth of around 100 - 486 200 nm , whereas spinning disc has a Z volume of ~ 500 nm in Z away from the PM , which 487 means fluorescently labeled CCVs are visible longer with spinning disk and thus have a longer 488 departure trace . This is extended by using sample cooling to slow down cellular dynamics . B ) 489 Example departure traces of TPLATE ( green ) and CLC2 ( magenta ) at single events of CME 490 demonstrating 4 different types of departure . ‘Together’ , where both traces display the same 491 lateral movement at the end of the trace and disappear together , which would be expected if 492 TPLATE is bound to the CCV under CLC2 as it cannot departure the CCV before uncoating 493 occurs before leaving the illumination volume ; ‘Clathrin 1 st’ , where the CLC2 trace disappears 494 before the TPLATE trace , which could indicate that CLC is removed as a layer before TPLATE 495 and ‘TPLATE 1 st’ , where the TPLATE trace terminates before the CLC2 trace , indicating that 496 it is free to leave the CCV before the clathrin coat dissociates . 497 Scale bar , B , 60 s . 498 499 500 Fig .

The TPC is required for membrane bending during plant CME 552 A ) In physiological conditions TPLATE and the TPC is recruited to the PM and clathrin is then 553 recruited to begin the coat assembly phase of CME . Then the membrane bends creating an 554 invagination against the high turgor pressure , here TPLATE is located at the rim of this 555 invagination and drives the membrane bending . Eventually as the CME vesicle grows , a tight 556 neck is created , where the TPC ring closes and after scission is able to departure the CCV 557 before clathrin as it is not associated within the coat . B ) During TPC disruption , TPLATE 558 aggerates in the cytoplasm , while clathrin and AtEH1 / Pan1 is still recruited to the PM but no 559 invagination is created as there the full TPC is not present , resulting in the failure of membrane 560 bending during the CME event . 561 562 Movie S1 .
