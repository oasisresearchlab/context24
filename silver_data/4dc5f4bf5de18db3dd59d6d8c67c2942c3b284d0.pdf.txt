Biochemical approaches like protein design and evolution are typically used to try and overcome these limitations , but suffer from the large num - ber of possible proteins and mutations in the various GEVI families . Here we approach this problem in a physical way and report that plasmonic coupling to nanoparticles ma - nipulates and enhances the photodynamics and fluorescence of GEVIs in live cells . We designed an optimal nanostar shape for plasmonic coupling through Finite - Difference Time - Domain ( FDTD ) computational models . We synthesized and characterized the resulting particles and quantified their influence on the brightness , voltage sensitivity , and response speed of the GEVI QuasAr6a . We incorporated the plasmonic enhance - ment into Markov chain photocycle models of Quasar6a , showing manipulation of both the light - dependent state transitions in the protein and of excited state fluorescence and paving the way for plasmonically enhanced voltage imaging . Introduction A comprehensive understanding of electrical signal propagation in neurons holds the potential to advance prevention , diagnosis , and treatment for debilitating disorders of the nervous system . 1 – 3 Changes in cellular membrane potential can be reported as changes in fluorescence by transmembrane proteins called Genetically Encoded Voltage Indicators ( GEVIs ) . 4 Making movies of neural membrane potential dynamics using this technique is termed Voltage Imaging , 5 – 7 and enables a choice of better spatial resolution , cellular specificity , response time , and signal fidelity compared to other electrophysiological techniques . 8 Early experiments showed the successful application of GEVIs in Escherichia Coli , 4 Drosophila , 9 and mice 10 , 11 to investigate the electrical activity of cells and networks in living organisms . However , GEVIs are not perfect transducers of electrical signals : 12 , 13 depending on 2 the GEVI family , they suffer from limitations in response speed and linearity , 9 filter - ing the electrical signals , or from limitations in fluorescence brightness 14 and voltage sensitivity , 15 limiting their usefulness in noisy in vivo measurements . For example , Archaerhodopsin - based GEVIs , which display a superior sensitivity to voltage in terms of their change in fluorescence brightness , 12 suffer from a quantum yield of approxi - mately 1 % 14 , 16 and are therefore dim in typical neuroscientific imaging experiments . Typical efforts to create brighter GEVIs focus on biochemical approaches . 17 – 19 Many efforts have been made to engineer 20 – 22 or evolve 11 , 16 , 23 , 24 improved GEVIs . Additionally , protein FRET pairs have been used to enhance fluorescence brightness at the expense of voltage sensitivity . 25 – 27 Here we take a physical approach , inspired by single molecule plasmonic enhancement experiments , where metal nanoparticles are coupled to nearby fluorophores to increase their fluorescence . 28 – 31 Plasmonic enhancement can lead to changes in the fluorescence of a dipole in two ways . 28 First , the plasmonic particle can localize an excitation field through resonance or lightning rod effect , 32 leading to the field enhancement (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ⃗E (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) 2 (cid:14) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ⃗E 0 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) 2 , which in turn leads to more photon absorption per unit time . Second , the probability of a dipole emitting an absorbed photon is given by Fermi’s golden rule 29 and can be changed by manipulating the Local Density of Optical States ( LDOS ) through careful positioning of dielectric or metallic elements in the presence of the dipole . 28 , 33 This effect is overall quantified by : Y = Γ Γ + Γ nr , dY = Γ nr ( Γ + Γ nr ) 2 d Γ ( 1 ) where Y is the quantum yield of the dipole ( i . e . the fraction of absorbed photons that is emitted as photons ) , Γ is the radiative decay rate and Γ nr is the non - radiative decay rate . In the presence of a standard LDOS , typically defined without the particular manipulation by nanoparticles one has in mind , Y is the characteristic quantum yield of the protein . 28 The presence of a plasmonic particle can manipulate the LDOS and lead to a change in radiative decay rate d Γ . 28 , 33 From Eq . ( 1 ) , it can be seen that this can lead to a significant change in quantum yield dY , provided Γ ≪ Γ nr . 30 3 We reasoned that judicious design and application of plasmonic particle geometry and spacing might allow us to achieve these effects in vivo , rather than in single - molecule experiments . Moreover , while these effects are typically measured in the manipulation of transitions between ground and electronically excited states of flu - orophores , 29 , 34 we reasoned that in proteins that undergo isomerization and confor - mational transitions upon absorption and emission of visible or ( near ) - infrared pho - tons , 18 , 19 we might be able to influence the protein dynamics as well through plasmonic enhancement . While we found sparse reference to attempts at plasmonic enhancement of fluorescence of proteins , 35 – 37 one reference attempting fluorescence enhancement of fixed cells labeled with fluorescent dyes , 38 and one in polymer and bacterial environ - ments , 39 we did not find attempts at this in electrophysiologically relevant conditions , let alone while incorporating influence on protein dynamics , and set out to test the feasibility of our idea . Results and Discussion Computational modelling We focused our investigation on the subclass of Archaerhodopsin - based GEVIs ( QuasArs 16 , 24 and Archon 17 ) because of their low native quantum yield , and referred to Archon1 as a common template for their structure and function . Our initial efforts aimed to increase the quantum yield Y of GEVIs . In a first - order approximation , the resonance spectrum of the plasmonic particles should then have maximum overlap with the GEVI emission spectrum , which was measured to be between 640 and 800 nm for Archaerhodopsin - derived sensors . 17 , 20 The first question to ask is then which particle geometry and material achieve the best field enhancement . We approached this question through Finite - Difference Time - Domain ( FDTD ) simulations and investigated a series of nanospheres , nanorods and various types of spiked nanoparticles in biocompatible gold and silver . Gold spheres 4 exhibited a suboptimal , broad peak in the range of interest ( Fig . S1 ) , gold nanorods were highly tunable , but the emergence of two resonant modes would have imposed accurate orientation ( Fig . S2 ) , in the same way as stars with a few sharp tips ( Figs . S3 - S4 ) . On the contrary , highly spiked stars are tunable in the range of interest and are robust to rotation ( Fig . S5 ) . Gold is a common plasmonic metal characterized by superior biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity ; 40 therefore , this material was the elected one throughout the manuscript . FDTD simulations confirmed that gold nanospheres in water resonate at 520 nm and hence are not suitable for our purpose ( Fig . 1a ) , as expected from plasmonic theory . 31 Gold nanostars are however tunable to the optimal wavelength ( Fig . 1a ) . Furthermore , the localization of the field around nanospheres spans the entire surface of the sphere and reaches , at best , a field enhancement of the order of tens ( Fig . 1b ) . In contrast , the local intensity of the electric fields around the sharp tips of nanostars could be enhanced hundreds - or even thousands - fold ( Fig . 1c ) . Plasmonic enhancement in live biological samples is hampered by the Brownian mo - tion of particles , 41 , 42 leading to changes in coupling distance and relative orientation between the particle and the emission dipoles and , therefore , noise in the enhance - ment characteristics . Nanostars might also suffer from irregularities in their makeup , influencing maximum enhancement . Finally , we quantified both effects and found that enhancement by nanostars was robust against the aforementioned noise sources ( Fig 1d , e , individual simulations available in Figs . S6 - S7 ) . Colloidally grown nanostars To synthesize the gold nanostars , we adapted a colloidal , seed - mediated growth pro - tocol 43 that allowed high shape control and tunability , by optimizing the molar ra - tio R = [ HAuCl 4 ] / [ seeds ] . We synthesized a series of nanostars under varying seed and growth conditions ( Methods section ) . We characterized the synthesized colloids through Energy Dispersive X - ray Spectroscopy ( EDX , Fig . S8 ) and Ultraviolet - Visible light ( UV - Vis ) spectroscopy , and the optimal sample ( R = 30 ) was selected based on 5 the alignment of the absorbance peak to the emission peak of Archon1 ( Fig . 2a ) . Although there appeared to be a minor mismatch between the peaks , it could be at - tributed to a red shift induced by polyvinylpyrrolidone ( PVP ) as a capping agent ( Eq . ( S4 ) ) ; once removed , the peaks should align almost perfectly . Quality control involved immobilizing the gold nanostars onto a silicon substrate via 3 - mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane ( MPTMS ) ( Fig . 2b ) , following a custom protocol ( Methods section ) , to examine them under a scanning electron microscope ( SEM , Fig . 2c ) . The individual nanostars from the optimal sample exhibited monodispersity and similarity with the simulations , where the average core radius was r = 23 ± 5 nm ( mean ± SD ) and the average tip length l = 12 ± 3 nm , ( mean ± SD , Fig . 2d ) . However , the gold nanostars occasionally clustered in micrometre - sized aggregates ( Fig . 2e ) , possibly affecting the overall plasmonic resonance and , consequently , the fluorescence enhancement . 44 Preliminary enhancement tests of Cyanine - 5 We next optimized a protocol to localize plasmonic particles to fluorescent dipoles in wet lab conditions . We chose Cyanine - 5 ( Cy5 ) as a model molecule to enhance the fluorescence because of its emission peak position and moderate quantum yield ( ∼ 30 % ) . 34 , 45 We hypothesized that Biotin - Streptavidin binding would provide a suitable way to link nanostars to fluorescent emitters in physiological conditions , and compared the fluorescence signals of Streptavidin - Cy5 ( Strep - Cy5 ) , a mixture of Strep - Cy5 and citrate - capped nanostars , and Strep - Cy5 bound to biotin - coated nanostars ( Fig . 3a ) However , we found that the presence of nanostars reduced the fluorescence signal by up to - 68 ± 16 % ( mean ± error , propagated from SD , Fig . 3b ) . We attribute this to a combination of the increased optical density in nanostar - containing samples , 46 and fluorescence quenching caused by non - radiative energy transfer from the fluorophore to the nanostar . 47 Streptavidin , the largest molecule in the binding complex , is around 5 nm , 48 , 49 keeping the fluorophore in the quenching range of the nanostar . 47 6 This experiment provided a baseline distance measurement , and we set out to in - crease the distance between the nanostars and the emitters . Using MPTMS , we immo - bilized gold nanostars functionalized with a complex of Bovine Serum Albumin ( BSA ) and biotin on glass , then added Strep - Cy5 ( Fig . 3c ) . Fluorescence spectroscopy showed a net 42 ± 6 % increase in the fluorescence intensity of Cy5 ( peak value ± error , propagated from noise SD , Fig . 3d ) . This value coincides with the estimated value ( Eq . ( S7 ) ) considering the combined lengths of streptavidin ( 5 nm ) 49 and BSA ( 8 nm ) 50 as a spacer larger than the quenching range , 47 the already significant quan - tum yield of Cy5 34 , 45 and the estimated average field enhancement of a factor 1 . 78 from previous simulations ( Fig . S9 ) . To use plasmonic enhancement with live cells , the effect needs to be compatible with cell culturing conditions . 51 Our proteins of interest are embedded in the cell membrane , a lipid bilayer . 18 Cells are typically attached to glass substrates using an extracellu - lar matrix protein , like fibronectin . 52 Given the sensitivity of the enhancement to the dielectric environment , we wondered whether the lipid bilayer or fibronectin would in - fluence the enhancement , and whether it would be better to embed nanostars in the fibronectin layer or apply them to the upper surface of cells . To test this , we immo - bilized nanostars on glass and used Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence ( TIRF ) mi - croscopy to investigate the effect of an artificial lipid bilayer and a standard fibronectin layer ( Methods section , Fig . 3e ) . In this in vitro experiment , we positioned lipid bilayers labelled with Cy5 on the sample and imaged the fluorescence with and without nanostars , and with and without fibronectin ( Fig . 3f ) . We measured a fluorescence enhancement of 90 ± 50 % ( mean ± error , propagated from SD ) associated with the direct coupling between Cy5 and nanostars , while the presence of the fibronectin layer reduced the effect to 30 ± 50 % enhancement ( mean ± error , propagated from SD ) , probably by acting as a spacer ( Fig . 3g ) . 47 In combination with the Strep - Cy5 results ( Fig . 3d ) , we estimate the distance between the Cy5 molecules and the nanostars to be 14 . 5 nm , respectively 8 . 5 nm with and without fibronectin ( Fig . 3h ) , providing an estimate for the thickness of the fibronectin layer amounting to 6 nm . 7 Plasmonic enhancement of QuasAr fluorescence in live cells Having shown that cell membrane embedding and fibronectin application do not hinder plasmonic enhancement of fluorophores , we performed a simple addition of colloidal nanostars to HEK293T cells expressing either QuasAr1 ( Fig . 4a ) or QuasAr6a ( Fig . 4b ) . We noticed an enhancement in the fluorescence of individual cells over time ( Fig . 4c ) . We quantified the time course of cell population fluorescence after the addition of the nanostars and noticed an increase of fluorescence to a factor 140 ± 80 % ( QuasAr1 , mean ± error , propagated from SE , Fig 4a ) and 28 ± 12 % ( QuasAr6a , mean ± error , propagated from the SE , Fig 4b ) respectively . We tested the difference between simple application of nanostars and embedding them in the fibronectin layer . We immobilized gold nanostars on glass , coated the surface with fibronectin , and plated HEK293T cells expressing QuasAr6a ( Fig . 4d ) . We performed a population screen of fluorescence at the bottom surface of the cells ( Fig 4e ) and achieved a fluorescence enhancement of 69 ± 19 % ( median ± error , propagated from the SE ) , confirmed by the fluorescence brightness of the median cell in a control , respectively enhanced sample ( Fig . 4f ) . The difference in enhancement of fluorescence between the nanostars applied to the top surface , respectively embedded in the fibronectin adhesion layer , indicates that the glycocalyx 53 – 55 surrounding the cells acts as an effective spacer between the fluorophores and the nanoparticles applied to the top surface of the cells . Photocycle manipulation via plasmonic enhancement Fluorescence enhancement of dim voltage sensors is one possible application of com - bining GEVIs with nanostars . Given that the kinetics of GEVIs are determined by a photocycle with absorption and potential emission events at multiple stages , 18 , 56 – 60 we hypothesized that interaction with plasmonic particles might also impact voltage sen - sitivity and response speed . We performed a voltage clamp experiment on HEK293T 8 cells expressing QuasAr6a plated on fibronectin over immobilized gold nanostars to test this . We varied the voltage across the cell membrane in steps from - 70 to + 30 mV and recorded the fluorescence response without ( Fig . 5a ) and with ( Fig . 5b ) nanostars in the fibronectin layer . We noticed a decrease in voltage sensitivity from a DF / F of 0 . 38 ± 0 . 07 to 0 . 11 ± 0 . 04 ( mean ± SD , Fig . 5c ) and an increase in response speed from τ up = 7 ± 2 ms to τ ′ up = 0 . 8 ± 0 . 1 ms and τ down = 6 ± 2 ms to τ ′ down = 1 . 1 ± 0 . 5 ms ( mean ± SD , Fig . 5d ) . The measured time constant of the plasmonically enhanced response was limited by the camera response time , rather than the protein kinetics . Following the template photocycle for Arch , 57 we modeled a phenomenological photocycle for QuasAr6a as a continuous - time finite - state Markov chain ( Fig . 5e ) . 61 Here , the M → N transition is voltage sensitive , the N → Q transition is photoactivatable , and Q is the excitable fluorescent state . We modelled fluorescence as proportional to Q - state population multiplied by field enhancement and fitted our data to models with varying transition rates and field enhancement . We found the best fit to the data , including enhanced brightness , decreased voltage sensitivity and faster kinetics , for a model incorporating k 3 = 24 s − 1 without plasmonic enhancement and k 3 = 1131 s − 1 and (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ⃗E (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) 2 (cid:14) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) ⃗E 0 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) 2 = 0 . 15 with plasmonic coupling ( Fig . 5f , complete parameters and results available in Tables S1 - S2 ) . Enhancement of only the quantum yield evidently does not explain the change in kinetics ( Fig . S10a ) , and enhancement of only k 3 leads to a worse fit of the data ( Fig . S10b ) . We interpreted the enhancement of k 3 and the reduced decay rate enhancement both as consequences of suboptimal coupling distance , resulting on one hand in the quenching of the fluorescence , and on the other in a strong localized field that affects the photoactivatable transition . Discussion This study shows the potential for enhancing both fluorescence and photosensitive protein kinetics using plasmonic enhancement in vivo . The emergence of noticeable 9 fluorescence enhancement , even without precise control over the coupling distance , suggested a robust effect that could be applied in vivo . Moreover , because plasmonic enhancement is a fast physical phenomenon lasting tens of femtoseconds , 62 it would be compatible with multiphoton excitation or other nonlinear imaging methods . In this study , we showed the influence of the glycocalyx on the measured enhancement . The glycocalyx can be used as a natural spacer layer , and its influence can be tuned by the binding protocol used to link nanoparticles to membrane proteins . This approach also opens up the possibility of enhancing the absorption and signal transduction of natu - rally occurring opsins and GPCRs . Interestingly , the photocycle simulations seemed to indicate that the glycocalyx does not contribute to the distance control when flu - orescent cells are plated on a layer of fibronectin embedding the nanostars , keeping the fluorophore at the edge of the quenching regime . This is because fibronectin binds directly to integrins present in the cell membrane , 63 minimizing the coupling distance to the fibronectin thickness . We hypothesize that a controlled trade - off between the enhancement of absorption ( k 3 ) and emission ( Y ) can be used to fine - tine voltage sen - sitivity , speed , and brightness of GEVIs . Protein evolution of GEVIs often leads to increases in brightness at the expense of decreases in the speed of response to voltage changes . 19 Plasmonic enhancement shows a way to achieve both effects simultaneously . Conclusions We showed the design and creation of gold nanostars for the enhancement of fluores - cence and protein kinetics of QuasAr - based GEVIs . We investigated the effect of elec - trophysiologically realistic dielectric environments on this effect and showed increases in response speed to voltage and fluorescence brightness . 10 Methods FDTD simulations Finite - difference time - domain ( FDTD ) numerical simulations were conducted using Lumerical’s FDTD Solu - tions , with scripts available on GitHub . 64 Simulations of gold nanospheres involved varying the radius R of a gold sphere submerged in water , with a focus on assessing the maximum field enhancement | E | 2 / | E 0 | 2 within a small cubic volume ( ∆ x = ∆ y = ∆ z = R / 2 ) located 4 nm from the surface . Simulations covered a range of radii ( R min = 6 nm to R max = 76 nm ) with 2 nm steps . Gold nanostar models were crafted based on SEM micrographs of synthesized nanoparticles . To generate these models , Blender software was employed to create complex meshes . The starting point for this modelling was an icosahedron shape , with its vertices extended to mimic the tip arrangement found on real nanostars . To ensure smoother surfaces , a Subdivision Surface Modifier was applied . During these simulations , a mesh size of 35 Meshes Per Radius ( MPR ) was consistently used . For benchmarking , a model nanostar with a core radius R of 25 nm and a tip length L tip of 10 nm was adopted . For the simulations shown in Figs . 1d and 1e , a core radius of 30 nm was used . Simulations explored variations in tip density and randomness to understand their implications for field enhancement . These variations included the random omission of tips and the random displacement of tip vertices , quantified using a ”randomness factor” in Blender ranging from 0 to 1 . Since the sharp tips simulated in Figs . 1a , 1c , and 1d generated unphysical fields when randomized in Blender , we introduced an adaptation to their sharpness to prevent unrealistic stretching and overly sharp edges . All scripts for Lumerical and Blender can be found on GitHub . 64 Colloidal synthesis In the presence of a high concentration of polyvinylpyrrolidone ( PVP ) dissolved in dimethylformamide ( DMF ) , highly branched nanostars can be obtained efficiently at room temperature . 65 Briefly , gold tips can grow on pre - formed gold seeds thanks to the reducing power of DMF and the excess of PVP . The protocol for making PVP - coated gold nanostars is based on the seed - mediated synthesis proposed by Barbosa et al . , 43 where gold spherical seeds of 15 nm of radius have been employed , and the last purification step has been carried out twice to minimize the cytotoxic effect of DMF . Given the estimated concentration of the gold seed solution ( 0 . 5 mM ) , 273 µ L of seeds were added to 15 mL of 10 mM PVP ( Sigma - Aldrich , PVP10 ) dissolved in DMF ( Sigma - Aldrich , D4551 ) , guaranteeing a controlled molar ratio of 30 . UV / Visible spectroscopy of gold nanostars colloid The absorbance spectra were measured using a compact Visible - NIR light source ( ecoVIS by Ocean Optics ) together with a compact STS spectrometer ( STS - VIS Microspectrometer , 350 – 800 nm , by Ocean Insight ) . Absorbance was measured using an integration time of 5 . 1 ms after background subtraction and intensity calibration , and averaged 1000 times . 11 MPTMS surface coating and nanoparticle immobilization For the preparation of the MPTMS - coated dishes , a 10 % MPTMS solution was prepared as follows : MPTMS ( 2 . 50 mL , Sigma - Aldrich , 175617 ) was combined with MilliQ water ( 2 . 50 mL ) , acetic acid ( 1 . 67 mL , Sigma - Aldrich , ARK2183 ) , and pure ethanol ( 18 . 3 mL , Sigma - Aldrich , EMSURE 1 . 00983 . 1000 ) . Prior to use , glass bottom dishes ( Cellvis , D35 - 14 - 1 . 5 - N ) and fragments of silicon wafers were cleaned using oxygen plasma for 1 to 2 minutes , and all subsequent reactions were completed within a 30 - minute timeframe . To prepare the substrates for cellular imaging , approximately 150 µ L of the MPTMS solution was gently dispensed into the recessed wells of the imaging dishes . These dishes were then carefully transferred to a large glass beaker and purged with nitrogen for 30 minutes ( or until dry ) . Any residual MPTMS was aspirated . The dishes were subsequently subjected to a series of rinsing steps , including one wash with 150 µ L of pure ethanol in the recessed well , one wash with 2 mL of pure ethanol across the entire dish , and a final rinse with 2 mL of MilliQ water across the entire dish . To ensure dryness , the dishes were placed in a vacuum oven at 65 ° C for 2 hours . 200 µ L of gold nanostars were uniformly added to cover each recessed well . The dishes were then incubated overnight in a 37 ° C incubator , ensuring their cleanliness and contamination - free environment . Subsequently , the nanostar - coated substrates were aspirated , subjected to two 2 mL MilliQ water washes , and dried to near dryness . They were stored in the incubator until their intended use . For silicon substrates , the protocol remained unchanged , with volumes adjusted proportionally to the chip’s surface area . SEM / EDX characterization SEM imaging was performed in a Thermo Fisher Scientific ( TFS ) Nova 600i Nano Lab dual - beam system with a primary beam energy of 5 kV and nominal current of 0 . 27 nA using the SE - TLD detector . All imaging was performed at 5mm working distance and in immersion mode . Horizontal field of view and dwell time were varied and are specified on each reported image . EDX measurements were performed in the same Nova Nanolab dual - beam SEM using an Oxford Instruments X - MAX 80 EDX detector . The working distance was kept at 5 mm to have the optimum EDX signal . Spectra were analyzed using the Oxford Instruments AZtec software . The reported map EDX was obtained with a primary beam energy of 5 kV . Si and O are mapped and reported in weight percentage ( Wt % ) . SEM image analysis We aimed to isolate individual nanoparticles in SEM images to characterize them based on their core radius and tip length . Therefore , an algorithm was created using Python and OpenCV , available on GitHub . 64 Firstly , the algorithm segmented the nanoparticles from the background using an Otsu adaptative threshold for bi - multimodal histograms . Secondly , an erosion was executed on the binary mask with 5 iterations and a 3 × 3 kernel to separate close nanoparticles . This way , we isolated the center of mass of the nanoparticles to iterate over the individual contours and generate individual masks for each nanoparticle ; on the individual mask , we performed a symmetric dilatation to revert the previous erosion . Next , from the mask of the individual nanoparticles , we calculated the inner maximum radius to find the core size and the minimum enclosing circle 12 to get the total radius and the tip length . Finally , we extracted the pixel / meters conversion factor using the images’ metadata for further analysis . Aggregates that were still detected as single nanoparticles have been filtered post - analysis by applying the 2 σ criterion on both radius and tip length . Fluorescence assays in solution Experiments in Figs . 2 , 3 . f , 3 . g , 4 and 5 were performed with nanostars grown in - house ; experiments in Figs . 3 . b and 3 . d were performed with commercially available nanostars . Commercial gold nanostars ( 100 nm ) as well as biotin - functionalized gold nanostars ( 100 nm ) , were obtained from Cytodiagnostics ( Catalog number : GU - 100 - 100 ) . Notably , their absorption maxima are closely aligned with our in - house synthesized nanostars . The experiments were conducted using standard 96 - well plates . 10 nM nanostars or biotin - functionalized nanostars , Streptavidin - Cy5 ( 10 µ M , ThermoFisher Scientific ) were in - troduced into the respective sample groups . Each group was prepared with three replicates to ensure statistical robustness . The 96 - well plates , housing the nanostars and Streptavidin - Cy5 samples , were incubated at 37 ° C for one hour to ensure complete binding between the components . Following this incubation , the fluorescence emissions were quantified and recorded with a Cary Eclipse Fluorescence Spectrophotometer ( Agilent Technologies ) . Fluorescence spectroscopy assays on substrates Glass coverslips underwent the MPTMS surface coating and nanoparticle immobilization , as indicated above . Approximately 60 µ L of this MPTMS solution was applied to the glass coverslips . The uniform layer of gold nanostars ( AuNS ) was deposited onto the substrates by adding 1 mL of AuNS solution to each recessed well . The containers housing the glass slides were then sealed and placed on an orbital shaker ( 100 rpm ) in a dark environment for an incubation period of 18 hours . On the following day , the AuNS - coated glass slides underwent three meticulous rinses with Milli - Q water , followed by gentle drying under a stream of nitrogen gas . To form monolayers of biotinylated bovine serum albumin ( bBSA ) on the substrates , 200 µ L of a 100 µ g / mL bBSA solution in PBS was applied to the substrate surfaces and allowed to incubate for 1 hour in a 37 ℃ incubator . 40 µ L of a 10 µ M Streptavidin - Cy5 solution was added to the substrate surfaces and incubated for 2 hours in a 37 ℃ incubator . Following the incubation , the substrates were rinsed 3 times with PBS to eliminate any unbound fluorophores and gently dried using a nitrogen gas stream . Fluorescence emission spectra of Streptavidin - Cy5 were measured using a photomultiplier tube ( R7600U - 20 , Hamamatsu ) coupled to a monochromator ( SP2300 , Princeton Instruments ) . Excitation light was provided by a xenon lamp connected to a monochromator ( Gemini 180 , HORIBA ) . Supported lipid bilayer formation A glass slide covered by a silicone gasket with four 100 µ l wells was prepared with different MPTMS - immobilized nanostars and fibronectin conditions prior to the bilayer formation . The two Avanti Polar lipids ( Birmingham , 13 AL ) used were 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( DOPC ) and 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine - N - ( Cyanine 5 ) ( DOPC - Cy5 ) . Lipids in chloroform were mixed in a molar ratio of 99 . 5 : 0 . 5 DOPC : DOPC - Cy5 in a glass vial . The chloroform was evaporated with nitrogen and dried in a vacuum desiccator overnight . The dried lipid film was resuspended in PBS . The glass vial with the solution was then vortexed in bursts of 30 seconds with 1 - minute intervals to resuspend all lipids and to stimulate the self - assembly of multilamellar vesicles . The solution was then sonicated in a high - capacity bath sonicator ( 10 % amplitude , 10 s on , 10 s off , for one hour ) to get a uniform size distribution of liposomes . 100 µ l of liposome solution was then deposited in each of the wells of the silicone gasket . The glass slides with liposomes were incubated for 30 min at room temperature to allow for supported lipid bilayer formation . All wells were washed four times with 200ul PBS after incubation . TIRF microscopy For the TIRF microscopy , an inverted microscope ( NikonTi2 - E , motorized ) equipped with a 100 × oil immersion objective ( Nikon Apo TIRF 1 . 49 NA ) and an Andor iXon Ultra 897 camera was used . The microscope was upgraded with an azimuthal TIRF / FRAP illumination module ( GATACA systems iLAS 2 ) . Samples were exited at 642 nm at 10 % laser power ( GATACA CW laser , 642nm / 110mW ) . The emission was filtered with a 706 / 90 filter . Samples were exited for 200 ms for each frame , and a multiplication gain 50 was used . The penetration depth automatically estimated by the system is 106 nm . HEK293T culture HEK293T cells ( Catalog number ATCC ® CRL - 3216 ™ ) with passage number ¡30 were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % Fetal Bovine Serum ( VWR Seradigm Premium Grade ) , 50 units / mL Penicillin ( Life Technologies ) , 50 µ g / mL Streptomycin ( Life Technologies ) , and 1 % Glu - taMAX ( Life Technologies ) at 37 ° C under 10 % CO 2 . Lentivirus preparation and transduction For lentivirus production , HEK293T cells were seeded at 4 · 10 6 cells per 100 mm polystyrene dish ( Sarstedt ) 1 day before transfection in order to achieve 80 % confluency at the moment of transfection . Cells were co - transfected with 1 . 5 µ g transfer plasmid carrying either QuasAr1 or QuasAr6a , 5 µ g of pMDLg / RRE ( Addgene plasmid # 12251 ) , 5 µ g of pRSV / Rev ( Addgene plasmid # 12253 ) , and 3 . 5 µ g of pMD2 . G ( Addgene plasmid # 12259 ) mixed in 400 µ L pre - warmed opti - MEM with 60 µ L polyethylenimine solution ( 1 µ g / µ L in PBS ) . 8 hours post - transfection , medium was replaced with fresh cell culture medium including 25 mM HEPES . Lentivirus - containing supernatant was collected 48 and 72 hours post - transfection . Supernatant collected 48 hours post - transfection was stored overnight at 4 ° C before pooling it with lentivirus collected 72 hours post - transfection . Supernatant was filtered through 0 . 22 µ m PVDF filters . Lentivirus was concentrated 15 - fold using LentiX concentrator reagent ( Takara ) , resuspended in PBS , and stored at - 80 ° C in 100 µ L aliquots . µ 14 For lentiviral transduction , 2 . 5 · 10 5 cells were seeded per 35 mm polystyrene dish ( Sarstedt ) 1 day before transduction in order to achieve 50 % confluency at the moment of transduction . Lentiviral aliquots were rapidly thawed in a 37 ° C water bath . 100 µ L of concentrated virus was added per dish . Cells were incubated with lentivirus for 24 hours , after which the media was replaced with fresh cell culture medium . Widefield fluorescence microscopy A custom - built 66 widefield microscope was employed to investigate the fluorescence of the QuasArs expressed in cells . Two continuous wave laser sources ( MLL - FN - 639 CNI and OBIS 488 LX , by Coherent ) were made uniform in polarization and beam diameter through zero - order half - wave plates ( WPH05M - 488 and WPH05M - 633 by Thorlabs ) , polarizers ( CCM5 - PBS201 / M by Thorlabs ) and individual collimators ( AC254 mounted achromatic doublets by Thorlabs ) . The beams were then combined using a dichroic mirror ( DMLP505 by Thorlabs ) and led through an acousto - optic tunable filter ( AOTFnC - VI S by AA Optoelectronics ) with a modulation rate of 22 kHz . With the exception of the patch clamp voltage imaging experiments , the beam diameter was expanded with a telescope ( AC254 mounted achromatic doublets by Thorlabs ) using flip mounts ( TRF90 / M by Thorlabs ) . The light was reflected from a Digital Micromirror Device ( DMD , Vialux V7001 by Texas Instruments ) into a tube lens ( TTL200 by Thorlabs ) and projected by the objective ( Olympus XLPLN25XWMP2 , NA 1 . 05 , working distance 2 mm ) onto the sample . The emitted fluorescence was reflected by a dichroic mirror ( Di03 - R405 / 488 / 532 / 635 - t3 - 32 × 44 by Semrock ) , collected using a tube lens ( TTL200 by Thorlabs ) and filtered further depending on the emission range ( FF01560 / 94 - 25 , FF01 - 582 / 64 - 25 , LP02 - 664RU - 25 and FF01 - 790 / SP - 25 by Semrock ) , before reaching the sCMOS camera ( ORCA Flash4 . 0 V3 , 2048 × 2048 pixels , 6 . 5 µ m pixel size by Hamamatsu ) where the image was captured in a low - noise configuration with a total magnification of 27 . 8 . The maximum powers after the objective in the telescope configuration are 40 mW for the 639 nm laser and 2 mW for the 488 nm laser ; without the telescope , the powers are 122 mW for the 639 nm laser and 5 . 2 mW for the 488 nm laser . Whole - cell patch - clamp recordings Patch - clamp technique and imaging was performed 72 hours after lentiviral transduction . Transduced cells were seeded in the 14mm glass well of fibronectin - coated glass bottom dishes ( Cellvis ) at a density of 1 . 5 · 10 4 cells per well 24 hours before the patch - clamp experiment . Before patch - clamp procedure , cells were washed gently three times with 2 mL of pre - warmed extracellular buffer ( EC buffer ) . Cells were immersed in 2 mL of EC buffer throughout the patch clamp procedure . Constitution of EC buffer is 125 mM NaCl , 2 . 5 mM KCl , 3 mM CaCl2 , 1 mM MgCl2 , 15 mM HEPES , and 30 mM glucose . 67 pH of EC buffer is adjusted to 7 . 3 with NaOH . Osmolarity of EC buffer is adjusted to 300 mOsm with sucrose . Borosilicate glass micropipettes were pulled from capillaries ( Sutter Instrument ) and filled with 10 µ L of intracellular medium ( IC medium ) . Constitution of IC medium is 125 mM K - gluconate , 8 mM NaCl , 0 . 6 mM MgCl2 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM HEPES , 4 mM Mg - ATP and 0 . 4 mM Na - GTP , with pH adjusted to 7 . 3 with KOH . 68 Osmolarity of IC medium is adjusted to 295 mOsm with sucrose . Tip resistance was verified to be between 5 and 10 MΩ . Cellular responses were evoked through voltage steps ranging from - 70 mV to 15 + 30 mV at a frequency of 5 Hz , while the fluorescence of QuasAr1 and QuasAr6a was excited at 639 nm . The camera frame rate in this setting is 1000 fps . Photocycle modelling and simulation The photocycle of QuasAr6a has been modelled as a 4 - state continuous - time Markov chain , where the putative biological macrostates corresponded directly to the mathematical states . Transitions were considered unidirec - tional . The Markov chain was expressed as a system of linear ODEs and solved numerically in Python using the LSODA solver ( Livermore Solver for Ordinary Differential equations with Automatic method switching for stiff and non - stiff problems ) . The features of simulated traces ( brightness enhancement , voltage sensitivities , response speeds ) are compared to those of the measured traces and improved following a custom - made genetic algorithm , where new parameters are randomly affected by Gaussian noise with predefined characteristics . After every 2000 generations , the best parameters are picked for the successive round of random variations . After repeating this process 50 times ( for a total of 10000 generations ) , the software outputs the best parameters , unless a plateau is reached before . To quantify the goodness of the fit in different conditions , we employed the χ 2 metrics on the fitted features compared to the one from the simulations . A lower χ 2 indicates a better agree - ment of the simulations with the data . The fitted values for the models can be consulted in the Supplementary Information , while the code can be accessed on GitHub . 64 16 Authors’ contributions Table 1 : Authors’ contributions according to CRediT taxonomy .
