Here we identify filamin FLNa as a Pak1 - interacting protein through a yeast two - hybrid screen using the amino terminus of Pak1 as a bait . FLNa is stimulated by physio - logical signalling molecules to undergo phosphorylation by Pak1 and to interact and colocalize with endogenous Pak1 in membrane ruffles . The ruffle - forming activity of Pak1 is functional in FLNa - expressing cells but not in FLNa - deficient cells . In FLNa , the Pak1 - binding site involves tandem repeat 23 in the carboxyl terminus and phosphoryla - tion takes place on serine 2152 . The FLNa - binding site in Pak1 is localized between amino acids 52 and 132 in the conserved Cdc42 / Rac - interacting ( CRIB ) domain ; accordingly , FLNa binding to the CRIB domain stimulates Pak1 kinase activity . Our results indicate that FLNa may be essential for Pak1 - induced cytoskeletal reorganization and that the two - way regulatory interaction between Pak1 and FLNa may contribute to the local stimulation of Pak1 activity and its targets in cytoskeletal structures . O ne of the earliest responses of cells to extracellular signals is a rapid reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton , which leads to the formation of motile structures , to alterations in cell shape and to changes in cell adhesiveness and locomotion . In mam - malian cells , the generation of actin - based dynamic motile struc - tures is regulated by the small GTPases of the Rho family 1 – 3 , whose cellular effects are mediated by downstream effectors 4 . For exam - ple , the Paks are targets of the GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1 . GTP - bound GTPases bind to Paks , which stimulates their kinase activity through autophosphorylation 5 . Stimulation of the kinase activity of Paks produces phenotypic changes reminiscent of those produced by Cdc42 and Rac1 ( ref . 6 ) . Activation of Pak1 by diverse signals , including polypeptide factors , also leads to its autophosphorylation at several sites including Thr 423 in the activation loop of the kinase 7 . Expression of an activated Pak1 T423E mutant triggers the dissolution of stress fibres and focal adhesion complexes and the formation of lamellipodia 8 , 9 . Pak1 is localized in areas of cortical actin cytoskeleton 10 . Many of the effects of Pak on the actin cytoskeleton seem to be inde - pendent of its kinase activity but dependent on protein – protein interactions ; in fact , the amino terminus of Pak1 interacts with molecules such as Nck , the guanine nucleotide - exchange factor Pix , and paxillin 6 , 11 . In addition , Pak1 mutants with defective GTPase - binding sites or kinase activity are able to induce the formation of membrane ruffles and filopodia 6 , 12 . Pak1 also stimulates the activi - ty of LIM kinase 1 , which in turn increases the phosphorylation and inactivation of cofilin , leading to a reduction in the depoly - merization of actin filaments 13 . But the precise molecular mecha - nisms by which Pak1 induces actin cytoskeletal rearrangements such as membrane ruffles in a GTPase - independent manner remain poorly understood . Ultimately , proteins that target the polymerization of actin and the three - dimensional arrangement of actin filaments mediate the actin cytoskeletal response of the small GTPases 14 . The FLN family of actin - binding proteins fulfil such a role . These proteins are pres - ent in the periphery of the cytoplasm , crosslink actin filaments into orthogonal networks , and link them to the cellular membranes 15 . FLNa is a phosphoprotein dimer comprising two subunits of rela - tive molecular mass 280 , 000 ( M r 280K ) , which each contain 24 tan - dem repeats of about 96 amino acids 16 , 17 . The actin - binding domain in FLNa is located in the N - terminal repeat 18 , whereas the dimerization domain is located in repeat 24 in the C terminus . Both of these domains are essential for the branching of actin filaments . FLNa interacts with several proteins involved in signal transduction and endocytosis , and most of these interactions occur through the C - terminal region of FLNa 15 . Although FLNa has been implicated in cell - surface stabilization and efficient cell motility 19 , 20 , its mech - anism of regulation by upstream signalling intermediates is unclear . Here we report that FLNa is a substrate of Pak1 and is required for Pak1 - mediated actin cytosketelal assembly , including ruffle for - mation . In addition , FLNa stimulates both the autophosphorylation and the kinase activity of Pak1 , and is also involved in activating LIM kinase , but not mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) , in response to growth factor . Together , these results indicate that two - way bidirectional Pak1 – FLNa interactions may locally influence the dynamics of actin cytoskeletal structures . Results Pak1 interacts with FLNa . To identify proteins that interact with Pak1 , we carried out a yeast two - hybrid screen of a mammary gland cDNA expression library using the N - terminal 1 – 270 amino acids of Pak1 as a bait . This bait contains several protein - binding motifs that differ among members of the Pak family . Sequencing of the positive clones identified many known Pak1 - binding proteins © 2003 Nature PublishingGroup NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOL 4 SEPTEMBER 2002 www . nature . com / naturecellbiology 682 articles ( Cdc42 , Rac1 , Pix and Nck ) . Many novel Pak1 - interacting proteins were also identified , including Wrch GTPase 21 and several inde - pendent isolates from the C - terminal region of FLNa ( Genbank accession number P21333 ) . The longest FLNa cDNA contained amino acids 1 , 795 – 2 , 647 and was used in the subsequent studies . The specificity of the Pak1 – FLNa interactions was verified by one - on - one transformation ( Fig . 1a ) . Cotransfection of FLNa and Pak1 constructs conferred on transformed colonies the ability to grow in medium lacking adenosine , histidine , tryptophan and leucine and to turn blue in a β - galactosidase assay , whereas cotransfection of GBDvector Pak11 – 270 Pak1 270 – 545 GBDvector Pak11 – 270 Pak1 270 – 545 GBDvector Pak11 – 270 Pak1 270 – 545 GADvector GAD – FLNa GAD – Rac1 GAD – Wrch - 1 – LT β - Gal – AHLT I npu t G S T G S T G S T – P a k 1 I npu t G S T – F L N a 35 S - Pak1 35 S - FLNa GST – FLNa GST – Pak1 GST GST IP : IgG Pak1 FLNa Pak1IgG Pak1 / FLNa Pak1 FLNa F - actin / Phos - Pak1 / FLNa Phos - Pak1 / FLNa Phos - Pak1 a b e f c d Figure 1 Identification of FLNa as a Pak1 - binding protein . a , Yeast cells were cotransfected with control GAD vector , GAD – FLNa , GAD – Rac1 or GAD – Wrch - 1 plus GBD vector , GBD – Pak1 ( amino acids 1 – 270 ) or GBD – Pak1 ( 270 – 545 ) .

To examine the Pak1 – FLNa interaction further , we tested the ability of an in - vitro - translated Pak1 protein to bind to 852 amino acids of FLNa fused to glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) . FLNa – GST but not GST effi - ciently interacted with 35 S - labelled full - length Pak1 ( Fig . 1b ) . Conversely , in - vitro - translated FLNa protein specifically interacted with GST – Pak1 ( Fig . 1c ) . The interaction of endogenous FLNa and Pak1 was confirmed by immunoprecipitation assay ( Fig . 1d ) and by confocal microscopy , which showed the colocalization of FLNa with Pak1 ( Fig . 1e ) or with activated Pak1 ( Fig . 1f ) on the dynam - ic membranes and ruffles . Colocalization of Pak1 and FLNa is induced by physiological sig - nals . Because FLNa crosslinks with actin filaments and it interacts with Pak1 ( Fig . 1 ) , we investigated whether Pak1 and FLNa would interact in MCF - 7 breast cancer cells stimulated with two physio - logical signals that activate Pak1 and induce reorganization of the C on t r o l HR G Pak1 FLNa C on t r o l L i p i d Pak1 FLNa C on t r o l HR G HR G + cy t o c ha l a s i n Pak1 FLNa Merge PAK1 FLNa Control Lipid HRG a d b c Figure 2 Physiological signals induce Pak1 and FLNa colocalization in ruf - fles . a , b , MCF - 7 cells that had been serum starved for 24 h were either untreated ( control ) or treated with 1 nM HRG ( a ) or 100 µ M sphingosine ( lipid ) for 15 min ( b ) .

Both HRG ( Fig . 2a ) and lipids ( Fig . 2b ) enhanced the association of FLNa and Pak1 , as determined by coimmunoprecip - itation assays using an antibody against FLNa and western blot analysis . Association of FLNa with Pak1 was dependent on the integrity of the cytoskeleton , because disruption of the cytoskele - ton by cytochalasin D considerably reduced the extent of enhanced Pak1 colocalization with FLNa ( Fig . 2c ) . Stimulation of MCF - 7 cells with both signals resulted in the colocalization of endogenous Pak1 with FLNa in selective areas , as visualized by confocal scanning microscopy ( Fig . 2d ) . Unstimulated MCF - 7 cells contained cortical actin , albeit ruffles . By contrast , the stimulation of MCF - 7 cells with HRG or lipid induced the formation of motile structures , such as dorsal ruffles and lamellipodia , and enhanced the specific accumulation and Filamin ( + ) A7 cells Filamin ( + ) A7 cells a d g k b e h l c f i m j n A7 M2 HER2 HER3 Pak1 FLNa LipidHRGTPA Pak1WT Pak1WT Pak1 ( 83 – 149 ) A7 M2 A7 100 80 60 40 20 120 0 P e r c en t age o f t r an s f e c t ed c e ll s w i t h m e m b r ane r u ff l e s o p C on t r o l HR G L i p i d T PA Filamin ( + ) A7 cells Filamin ( – ) M2 cells Filamin ( + ) A7 cells Figure 4 Pak1 - mediated ruffle formation requires FLNa . a – f , FLNa - expressing A7 ( a – c ) or FLNa - deficient M2 ( d – f ) cells were transfected with Myc - tagged wild - type Pak1 , serum starved for 24 h , and then treated for 15 min with 1 nM HRG ( b , e ) or 100 µ M sphingosine ( c , f ) .

FLNa is a substrate of Pak1 . Because FLNa is phosphorylated on serine / threonine 16 , we next examined the effect of several known inducers of Pak1 kinase activity ( that is , HRG , serum and lipids ) on the phosphorylation of endogenous FLNa . As shown by immuno - precipitation of FLNa from MCF - 7 cell lysates that were metaboli - cally labelled with 32 P - orthophosphoric acid , FLNa phosphoryla - tion was indeed stimulated by all three signals ( Fig . 3a ) . To study the possibility that Pak1 can phosphorylate FLNa in vivo , we used an established human malignant melanoma model system consisting of tumour cell lines M2 and A7 . Whereas M2 cells do not express detectable levels of FLNa , are defective in cell locomotion and show prolonged membrane blebbing , the A7 cells have this phenotype reversed through the stable expression of wild - type amounts of FLNa protein 19 . Cotransfection of wild - type Pak1 but not kinase - dead Pak1 ( Pak1 K299R / H83L / H86L ) induced HRG - mediated phosphorylation of FLNa in M2 cells metaboli - cally labelled with 32 P - orthophosphoric acid . Cotransfection of constitutively active Pak1 ( Pak1 T423E ) also stimulated phosphory - lation of FLNa ( Fig . 3b ) . To show that FLNa is a direct substrate of Pak1 , we carried out an in vitro kinase assay using purified FLNa expressed in bac - ulovirus . Pak1 enzyme was purified from Escherichia coli as a partially active fusion protein that could be activated further by incubation with sphingosine . Pak1 phosphorylated full - length FLNa in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 3c , lanes 2 – 4 ) . Incubation with lipid , a known activator of Pak1 , further increased the phos - phorylation of FLNa ( Fig . 3c , lanes 4 and 5 ) . Identification of Pak1 phosphorylation site on FLNa . We located the Pak1 phosphorylation site on FLNa by using a peptide digestion method . FLNa contains two sites of calpain cleavage 16 , and diges - tion of FLNa produces an N - terminal polypeptide of 180K and two C - terminal polypeptides of 90K and 10K . The cleavage of the 10K fragment from the remaining C - terminal region is inefficient and thus digestion results in polypeptides of 180K , 100K , 90K and 10K . To identify the region of FLNa containing the Pak1 phosphoryla - tion sites , we phosphorylated baculovirus - expressed purified FLNa with GST – Pak1 . The GST – Pak1 was then removed by GST beads , and phosphorylated FLNa was digested with calpain , separated by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS – PAGE ) and devel - oped by autoradiography . Phosphorylation occurred only on the C - terminal portion of FLNa , and the N - terminal 180K polypeptide was not phosphorylated by Pak1 ( Fig . 3d ) . We next examined whether Pak1 could phosphorylate fusion proteins of the C - terminal region of FLNa . Pak1 phosphorylated to a similar extent two FLNa fusion proteins containing amino acids 1 Gal4 vector 2 FLNa ( 1795 – 2647 ) 3 FLNa ( 2360 – 2647 ) 4 FLNa ( 2103 – 2454 ) 5 FLNa ( 2103 – 2524 ) – LT – AHLT – + + – + FLNa ( 1795 – 2647 ) G S T – P a k 1 G S T G S T – P a k 1 G S T G S T – P a k 1 G S T F L N a ( 1795 – 2647 ) F L N a ( 2103 – 2524 ) F L N a ( 2103 – 2454 ) FLNa ( 2103 – 2524 ) FLNa ( 2103 – 2454 ) Input 96 - 66 - 44 - 30 - 96 - 66 - 44 - 30 - M r ( K ) 35 S - FLNa GST – Pak1 GST 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Pak1 WT 270 – 545 1 – 132 132 – 270 1 – 75 52 – 132 75 – 149 Pak1 WT 270 – 545 1 – 132 132 – 270 1 – 75 52 – 132 75 – 149 G S T 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 GST – Pak1 fusions Binding + + – + – – + – a c d b Figure 6 Location of the interaction domains of Pak1 and FLNa . a , Fusion proteins of the Gal4 activation domain and FLNa deletion mutants were used to determine the Pak1 - binding region in FLNa in a two - hybrid assay .

GST fusion proteins of wild - type Pak1 ( amino acids 1 – 545 ) , and the kinase domain ( 270 – 545 ) , N - terminal domain ( 1 – 132 ) , PIX - binding domain ( 132 – 270 ) , NCK - binding domain ( 1 – 75 ) , CRIB domain ( 52 – 132 ) and autoinhibitory domain ( 75 – 149 ) of Pak1 were incubated with the indicated in - vitro - translated FLNa deletion constructs . Binding was analysed by GST pull - down assay . © 2003 Nature PublishingGroup articles NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOL 4 SEPTEMBER 2002 www . nature . com / naturecellbiology 687 1 , 795 – 2 , 647 and amino acids 2 , 103 – 2 , 520 ( Fig . 3e ) . These results suggested that the Pak1 phosphorylation sites were localized in the region of FLNa containing residues 2 , 103 – 2 , 520 . Accordingly , mutation of Ser 2152 to alanine completely abolished the phos - phorylation of FLNa by Pak1 ( Fig . 3f ) . Mutation of Thr 2328 to ala - nine had no effect on Pak1 - mediated phosphorylation , whereas the mutation of Ser 2292 and Ser 2370 to alanine reduced the magni - tude of Pak1 phosphorylation of FLNa in vitro . Ser 2152 also seemed to be important for Pak1 - mediated ruffle formation in vivo ( Supplementary Information Fig . S1 and see below ) . To establish further the role of Ser 2152 in FLNa phosphoryla - tion by Pak1 in vivo , we carried out transient transfection assays in FLNa - deficient M2 cells using wild - type or mutant FLNa . M2 cells do not express detectable quantities of FLNa mRNA or protein 19 . Treating the M2 cells with HRG induced the phosphorylation of wild - type but not mutant FLNa , but cotransfection of an autoin - hibitory Pak1 domain ( residues 83 – 149 ) abolished the HRG - induced phosphorylation of wild - type FLNa ( Fig . 3g ) . These find - ings indicate that physiological regulators of Pak1 activity may stimulate the phosphorylation of FLNa and that Pak1 may phos - phorylate FLNa both in vitro and in vivo . Pak1 - induced ruffle formation requires FLNa . Because FLNa and Pak1 colocalized in membrane ruffles , we reasoned that FLNa may be important in Pak1 - induced ruffle formation . We therefore transfect - ed FLNa - expressing ( A7 ) and FLNa - deficient ( M2 ) cells with Myc - tagged Pak1 and then treated them with HRG or lipid . The ability of the cells to form ruffles was analysed by confocal microscopy using an antibody against Myc to visualize Pak1 ( green ) and a monoclonal antibody against FLNa to visualize endogenous FLNa ( red ; Fig . 4a – f ) . In FLNa - transfected A7 cells , both HRG and lipid induced the formation of dorsal membrane ruffles and promoted the localization of FLNa and Pak1 in ruffles in more than 80 % of cells expressing Myc – Pak1 ( Fig . 4a – c , p ) . But both HRG and lipid failed to induce ruffle formation in FLNa - deficient M2 cells , despite the expression of Myc – Pak1 ( Fig . 4d – f , p ) . The failure of HRG to induce ruffle forma - tion in M2 cells was not due to a lack of HRG receptors in these cells , because both A7 and M2 cells expressed similar amounts of human epidermal growth factor receptor - 2 and - 3 ( Fig . 4o ) . To determine whether the Pak1 pathway is required for ruffle formation in FLNa - expressing A7 cells , we examined the effect of a dominant - negative Pak1 autoinhibitory fragment ( residues 83 – 149 ) 25 on the formation of ruffle formation by HRG or lipid signals . Both HRG and lipid failed to induce ruffle formation in A7 cells expressing the GST - tagged Pak1 autoinhibitory domain ( Fig . 4h , i ) . By contrast , A7 cells not expressing the Pak1 autoin - hibitory fragment did form ruffles after treatment with HRG or lipid . Treatment of cells with 12 - O - tetradecanoylphorbol - 13 - acetate ( TPA ) induced ruffles in both types of cell , which suggests that pathways other than the HRG pathway function in the pres - ence of Pak1 autoinhibitory fragment ( ref . 26 and Fig . 4j , n ) . Together , these results indicate that the ruffle formation mediated by HRG and lipids requires Pak1 signalling . Active Pak1 does not induce ruffles in FLNa - deficient cells .

There was a slight increase in peripheral actin stain - ing in 40 % of transfected cells ( Fig . 5a , g ) . The observed defect in ruffle formation induced by the Pak1 T423E mutant in the FLNa - defi - cient M2 cells could be repaired in more than 90 % of cells by the transient coexpression of FLNa ( Fig . 5c , blue ) , as indicated by the white colour arising from superimposition of red ( actin ) , green ( Pak1 T423E ) and blue ( FLNa ) stains ( Fig . 5c ) . However , expression of a FLNa S2152A mutant failed to rescue the defect in ruffle formation in cells expressing the Pak1 T423E mutant ( Fig . 5d , g ) . The lack of Pak1 - mediated ruffle formation in M2 cells expressing the Pak1 T423E mutant was not due to a lack of the sig - nalling components that mediate ruffles in these cells , because treatment of M2 cells with TPA effectively induced ruffle formation in these cells ( Fig . 5e , f ) . The interacting domains of Pak1 and FLNa . Of the four positive FLNa clones obtained in the two - hybrid screen , the shortest clone ( number 53 , residues 2 , 361 – 2 , 647 ) had three tandem repeats , including the C - terminal dimerization domain of 65 amino acids . We therefore reasoned that the Pak1 - binding site in FLNa might be located in residues 2 , 361 – 2 , 647 . To identify the minimal region of FLNa required for its interaction with Pak1 , we examined the ability of FLNa mutants with deletions in this region to interact in a two - hybrid screen with Pak1 . Deleting repeat 24 ( residues 2 , 524 – 2 , 647 ) , which contains the FLNa dimerization motif , had no effect on the interaction between FLNa and Pak1 ( Fig . 6a ) . But deleting repeats 23 and 24 ( residues 2 , 454 – 2 , 647 ) completely abolished the ability of FLNa to interact with Pak1 , which suggests that repeat 23 is the Pak1 - binding site in FLNa ( Fig . 6a ) . Similarly , in GST pull - down assays , FLNa fragments lacking repeat 23 failed to interact with GST – Pak1 ( Fig . 6b ) . We investigated the FLNa - binding site in Pak1 by GST pull - down assays using GST fusion proteins of various domains of Pak1 ( Fig . 6c ) . We found that the N - terminal region of Pak1 con - taining residues 1 – 132 can interact with FLNa and that the CRIB domain of Pak1 containing residues 52 – 132 is sufficient to inter - act with the C - terminal domain of FLNa . FLNa activation of Pak1 activity . Because FLNa evidently inter - acts with Pak1 through the Pak1 CRIB domain , and because the binding of Cdc42 / Rac1 to the CRIB region has been shown to activate Pak1 by relieving Pak1 autoinhibition 6 , we examined the hypothesis that the interaction of FLNa with Pak1 may relieve Pak1 autoinhibition and thereby increase Pak1 activity . A fusion protein of GST and the C - terminal 852 amino acids of FLNa was incubated with Pak1 enzyme , and Pak1 activity was then meas - ured using myelin basic protein ( MBP ) as a substrate ( Fig . 7a ) . Notably , FLNa increased the activity of Pak1 towards the exoge - nous MBP substrate in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 7a ) . We next examined the potential effect of FLNa on the stimula - tion of Pak1 kinase activity in vivo . We found that transient coex - pression of FLNa and wild - type Pak1 enhances the kinase acitivi - ty associated with wild - type Pak1 ( Fig . 7b ) . Overexpression of FLNa fragment 2 , 103 – 2 , 524 , which contains the Pak1 - binding site , reduced the magnitude of Pak1 activation by HRG ( Fig . 7c ) . Accordingly , expression of FLNa mutant lacking repeat 23 failed to increase the magnitude of the Pak1 kinase in response to HRG signalling ( Fig . 7d ) . To examine the physiological relevance of FLNa regulation of Pak1 activity , we investigated the effect of HRG stimulation of Pak1 activity on phosphorylation of cofilin by LIM kinase ( a known target of Pak1 ) 13 in the melanoma cell lines A7 and M2 . HRG treatment of the FLNa - expressing A7 cells rapidly stimulat - ed the phosphorylation of cofilin , as expected ( Fig . 7e , lanes 1 – 4 ) ; by contrast , HRG failed to stimulate cofilin phosphorylation in FLNa - deficient M2 cells ( Fig . 7e , lanes 5 – 8 ) . Because FLNa stimulates Pak1 activity , we thought that FLNa might contribute towards the magnitude of Pak1 activation . We therefore examined the kinetics of the HRG regulation of Pak1 activation in the melanoma cell lines A7 and M2 . Treating FLNa - expressing A7 cells with HRG resulted in a rapid , sustained acti - vation of Pak1 for up to 30 min ( Fig . 7f ) . However , treating FLNa - deficient M2 cells with HRG resulted in considerably less activation of Pak1 and its attenuation after 15 min ( Fig . 7f ) . The observed defects in the activation of Pak1 and LIM kinases in FLNa - deficient M2 cells were not due to impairment of upstream HRG signalling components , as HRG efficiently stimulated MAPK in both A7 and M2 cells ( Fig . 7g ) . Together , these observa - tions suggest that FLNa may have a role in maintaining Pak1 acti - vation , perhaps through bidirectional regulatory interactions between Pak1 and FLNa . Discussion We have found that FLNa interacts directly with Pak1 and that the FLNa – Pak1 interaction is essential for ruffle formation by Pak1 or its physiological inducers . Our conclusions are based on the fol - lowing observations . First , Pak1 interacted with FLNa in a yeast two - hybrid screen , in in vitro GST pull - down assays , and in in vivo coimmunoprecipitation assays with endogenous FLNa and Pak1 . Second , physiological HRG and lipid signals induced the colocal - ization of Pak1 and FLNa in ruffles in a dose - dependent manner . Third , activated Pak1 failed to induce ruffle formation in FLNa - deficient cells and dominant - negative Pak1 inhibited ruffle forma - tion in FLNa - expressing cells . Fourth , the ability of Pak1 to induce ruffle formation could be restored in FLNa - deficient cells by coex - pression of FLNa . Last , FLNa was found to be a physiological sub - strate of Pak1 . The mechanism by which Pak1 regulates cytoskeletal reorgani - zation remains elusive . Kinase - defective Pak1 has been shown to have some effects on cytoskeletal reorganization 27 . Kinase - dead Pak1 can induce the formation of lamellipodia and the accumula - tion of focal points . These effects are therefore independent of the kinase activity of Pak1 ( refs 9 , 12 ) . Studies that showed a kinase - independent effect on membrane ruffling used Pak constructs that are defective in GTPase binding ( Pak1 H83L / H86L ) 12 but have partial constitutive kinase activity and thus may account for excessive ruf - fling . We previously showed that excessive ruffling is induced by a Pak1 H83L / H86L mutant ( which is defective in Cdc42 / Rac1 binding ) in breast cancer cells 23 , whereas no ruffling occurs with expression of a kinase - dead Pak1 K299R mutant in breast cancer cells 28 . But expres - sion of the Pak1 K299R mutant in MDA - MB435 cells resulted in excessive cell spreading and the accumulation of mature focal points . Expression of this mutant in M2 cells also resulted in exces - sive cell spreading and formation of lamellipodia ( Supplementary Information Fig . S2 ) , which indicates that the kinase - independent effects of Pak1 are not blocked in M2 cells . FLNa is a dimeric protein and repeats 22 – 24 , which contain the dimerization domain , are important in recruiting Cdc42 , Rac1 and RalA15 . But FLNa interacts with SEK1 kinase 29 and caveolin - 1 ( ref . 30 ) only through repeats 22 and 23 , and does not require repeat 24 . Similarly , we have shown here that Pak1 interacts with FLNa through repeat 23 and that this interaction does not require repeat 24 . The ability of FLNa to interact with Pak1 — a down - stream effector of the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1 — raises the possibility that the FLNa – Pak1 interaction may be a platform for the GTPase activation of Pak1 . In addition , it is also possible that FLNa , through its ability to bind to signalling molecules , may be an integrator that connects membrane receptors to the cytoskeletal signals through activation of Pak1 . In vivo , an interaction between Pak1 and FLNa proteins was only observed after stimulation with physiological signalling mol - ecules . These results suggest that signal - mediated modification , localization or unmasking of the domains may have a functional role in the FLNa and Pak1 interaction in vivo . Pretreatment with cytochalasin D also inhibited the HRG - induced interaction of © 2003 Nature PublishingGroup articles NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOL 4 SEPTEMBER 2002 www . nature . com / naturecellbiology 689 Pak1 with FLNa in vivo , which suggests that an intact cytoskeletal structure is essential for the HRG - mediated interaction of Pak1 and FLNa . Studies have implicated signalling molecules other than the small GTPases in the stimulation of Pak activity 24 , 31 . Our observa - tion that FLNa binds to the CRIB domain of Pak1 is important because it suggests another potential mechanism of regulating Pak1 activity independently of GTPases . In addition , the interaction of FLNa with the CRIB domain of Pak1 , coupled with the ability of FLNa to activate Pak1 , indicates that FLNa may be involved in locally activating Pak1 in membrane ruffles . Because FLNa binds several small GTPases including Rac1 , Cdc42 and RalA 32 , it is also possible that FLNa activation of Pak1 in vivo is partially mediated by these GTPases and that FLNa may be a platform for bringing interacting proteins together . Methods Cell cultures , reagents , transfection and cell extracts We maintained MCF - 7 breast cancer cells in a 1 : 1 mixture of DMEM and F12 media supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum . Antibodies against Pak1 were purchased from Santa Cruz and Zymed . Human melanoma M2 and A7 cell lines were maintained as described 19 . Antibodies against T7 and FLNa were purchased from Novagen and Chemicon , respectively . Antibody against LIM kinase was obtained from Santacruz . Antibody against Pak1 phosphophorylated on Thr 423 has been described 33 . We carried out transient transfections using a Fugene - 6 kit ( Roche Biochemicals ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Cell lysates were prepared as described 23 , resolved on an 8 % SDS – PAGE , transferred to a nitrocellulose filter , and probed with the appropriate antibodies . Two - hybrid library screening Pak1 baits were constructed by amplifying amino acids 1 – 270 and 270 – 545 of Pak1 by polymerase chain reaction and subcloning the products into Gal4 - binding domain vectors ( pGBD , Clontech ) . Both Pak1 baits were used to screen a mammary gland cDNA library fused to the Gal4 activation domain ( Clontech ) as described 34 . We screened a total of 2 × 10 6 clones . Positive clones were isolated and sequenced at the M . D . Anderson Cancer Center core sequencing facility . We also verified posi - tive clones by one - on - one transformations with selection on agar plates lacking adenine , histidine , tryptophan and leucine , and by β - galactosidase assay . Plasmid construction We generated constructs containing FLNa tagged with Gal4 , GST and T7 by amplifying the selected region of FLNa from the two - hybrid clone obtained from library screening and then subcloning it into the Bam H1 and Xho I sites of the Gal4 ( Clontech ) , pGEX5X ( Amersham ) and pcDNA3 . 1 ( Invitrogen ) vectors . The S2152A , S2292A , S2336A and S2370A mutations were generated by site - directed mutagenesis using GST – FLNa 2 , 103 – 2 , 350 as a backbone and the Quick Change mutagene - sis kit ( Stratagene ) . The wild - type FLNa construct ( PREP4 – FLNa ) has been described 19 . We generat - ed mutations in the expression vector for full - length FLNa by site - directed mutagenesis using the Quick Change kit and PREP4 – FLNa as a backbone . To construct the FLNa mutant lacking tandem repeat 23 ( FLNa del23 ) , we used the Quick Change mutagenesis kit to engineer two Asc 1 restriction sites into the PREP4 – FLNa wild - type plas - mid at positions flanking repeat 23 ( nucleotides 7 , 441 and 7 , 741 ) . The FLNa del23 mutant was cre - ated by digesting this construct with Asc I followed by self - ligation . The FLNa del23 construct lacks a region of 300 bp encoding repeat 23 . We verified the sequence of this construct at the M . D . Anderson Cancer Center core facility . Pak1 kinase assay In vitro kinase assays using MBP or GST – FLNa fusion protein were carried out in 50 mM HEPES , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM MnCl 2 and 1 mM dithiothreitol containing 1 µ g of purified bacterially expressed GST – Pak1 enzyme , 10 µ Ci of γ - 32 P - ATP and 25 µ M cold ATP . The reaction was carried out in a volume of 30 µ l for 30 min at 30 °C and then stopped by adding 10 µ l of 4 × SDS sample buffer . We analysed the reaction products by SDS – PAGE gel and autoradiography . In some in vitro kinase assays , spingosine lipid ( 100 µ M ) was added to the reaction . Expression of full - length FLNa in a baculovirus system has been described 16 . For calpain diges - tion , 3 µ g of purified FLNa was used in a in vitro kinase reaction using GST – Pak1 enzyme as above . Pak1 enzyme was removed by GST beads , and labelled FLNa was digested with calpain as described 16 . GST pull - down assay In vitro transcription and translation of the Pak1 and FLNa proteins were carried out using the TNT transcription – translation system ( Promega ) as described 35 . In brief , the appropriate cDNAs ( 1 µ g ) in pcDNA 3 . 1 vectors were translated in vitro in the presence of 35 S - methionine in a reaction volume of 50 µ l using a T7 - TNT kit ( Promega ) . The reaction mixture was diluted to 1 ml with NP40 lysis buffer ( 25 mM Tris , 50 mM NaCl , 1 % Nonidet P40 ) . A 250 - µ l aliquot was used for each GST pull - down assay . Translation and product size were verified by analysing 2 µ l of the reaction mixture by SDS – PAGE and autoradiography . We carried out the GST pull - down assays by incubating equal amounts of GST , GST – Pak1 , GST – FLNa and GST – Pak1 proteins immobilized on GST beads ( Amersham ) with in - vitro - translated 35 S - labelled Pak1 or FLNa protein . We analysed the bound proteins by incubating the beads for 2 h at 4 °C , washing them five times with NP40 lysis buffer , eluting the proteins with 2 × SDS buffer , resolving them by SDS – PAGE and developing the gel by fluorography . Immunofluorescence and confocal studies We determined the cellular localization of different proteins by indirect immunofluorescence as described 23 . Briefly , cells grown on glass cover slips were fixed in methanol at – 20 °C for 6 min . Cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h , washed three times in PBS , and then incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with 546 - Alexa ( red ) , 633 - Alexa ( blue ) or 488 - Alexa ( green ) . The DNA - dye Topro - 3 was used to co - stain the DNA ( blue ) . Cells treated only with the secondary anti - bodies or pretreated with the peptide against which the antibody to phosphorylated Pak1 was raised were used as controls . We carried out confocal scanning microscopy on a Zeiss laser - scanning confocal microscope according to established methods . Each section was examined for each stain at two excitations ( 546 nm , and 488nm or 633nm , as indicated in the text ) and data were compared pixel by pixel . Each image represented z sections taken at the same cellular level and magnification ; a three - dimensionally reconstructed image was used to visualize the whole sample . Colocalization of two proteins , stained in red and green or green and blue , was indicated by the development of yellow or cyan colours , respec - tively . In the case of triple staining , the colocalization of red - , green - and blue - stained proteins gener - ated a white colour .
