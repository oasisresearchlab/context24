Here , we demonstrate characterization of dry silicone and hydrated polyethylene glycol . Microscale tools , including atomic force microscopes and nanoindenters , often have limited functionality in hydrated environments . While electrostatic comb - drive actuators are particularly susceptible to moisture damage , through chemical vapor deposition of hexamethyldisiloxane , we increase the hydrophobicity of our electrostatic devices to a water contact angle 90 ± 3 ◦ . With this technique , we determine the effective shear stiffness of both dry and hydrated samples for a range of soft substrates . Using computational and analytical models , we compare our empirically determined effective shear stiffness with existing characterization methods , rheology , and nanoindentation , for samples with shear moduli ranging from 5 – 320 kPa . This work introduces a new approach for microscale assessment of synthetic materials that can be used on biological materials for basic and applied biomaterials research . S Online supplementary data available from stacks . iop . org / JMM / 23 / 085001 / mmedia ( Some ﬁgures may appear in colour only in the online journal ) Introduction In this paper , we present a microelectromechanical systems ( MEMS ) electrostatic actuator for shear characterization ( ASC ; ﬁgure 1 ) that effectively characterizes the microscale shear properties of hydrated samples . We have previously introduced our device and approach as a way to overcome the limitations often encountered when existing microcharacterization tools interface with hydrogels [ 1 ] , and now we report the full characterization . Soft , hydrated samples are common in biology and biomedical research ; however existing approaches and microcharacterization tools face challenges in characterizing hydrated biological materials . 6 Equal contribution . Most soft tissues in the body have high water content , therefore hydrogels and other soft substrates are often used in vitro to study single - and multi - cellular behavior . Hydrogels , like polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) , can be made to mimic the material properties of tissues and are used speciﬁcally to examine cellular response to these properties . To fully understand the effect of substrate stiffness on cell behavior , though , the substrate must be effectively characterized in hydrated environments . Despite the popularity of these hydrogel experimental platforms , characterizing their material properties remains challenging . While rheometers are often used to characterize soft , hydrated samples in shear , most rheology systems are unable to capture microscale behavior . The resolution of these systems is based on the geometry of the punch , typically larger than 1 mm 0960 - 1317 / 13 / 085001 + 09 $ 33 . 00 1 © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd Printed in the UK & the USA J .

Photograph and enlarged model of actuator for shear characterization ( ASC ) . ( a ) The ASC is driven electrostatically by voltage applied to the device through bond pads and wire bonds . ( b ) Enlarged model of the drive electrodes , which are supported by four ﬂexures and separated from the remainder of the device . These ﬂexures are representative of springs in parallel with a total stiffness represented as k spring . The actuator foot is connected to a base and to the drive electrodes via the two - foot supports as shown . The operation principle of ASC relies on electrostatic force generation where the drive electrodes move Foot B to the left . In this depiction , Foot A is removed from the remainder of the device and appears to be ﬂoating , however it is always stationary . in diameter , where larger surfaces and volumes increase the accuracy of the results . Microrheology , which utilizes optical detection of moving tracer particles [ 2 ] , tends to characterize shear properties in the bulk of the material rather than at the surface . Other microscale tools characterize substrates in the normal direction . Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and nanoindentation provide methods for determining substrate resistance to penetration at a localized point , and an elastic modulus can be extracted using modiﬁed Hertz contact models [ 3 , 4 ] . While the traditional compliance - based approach used for nanoindenters is suitable to study metals , ceramics , and other stiff materials , this approach is often challenging to use on soft hydrogels , since these materials have high adhesion energies and viscoelastic responses [ 5 ] . In both AFM and nanoindentation , high surface energy signiﬁcantly increases tip – substrate interaction , creating computational errors of increased apparent stiffness due to pull - off miscalculations [ 6 , 7 ] , and overestimation of elastic moduli due to contact point misidentiﬁcation [ 8 ] . It is also important to maintain hydration of the hydrogels during measurements , since dehydrating conditions can result in observed stiffness up to three orders of magnitude larger than the hydrated stiffness [ 9 ] and rehydrated samples often remain stiffer than their pre - dehydrated conditions [ 10 ] . Many MEMS devices have been designed and fabricated to characterize samples not suited for AFM and nanoindentation [ 11 ] . However , most of these tools are designed to operate in dry environments . Electrostatic devices , in particular , are susceptible to moisture damage ( reviewed in Maboudian and Howe [ 12 ] ) . We chose to demonstrate this new method of characterization on PEG , a popular synthetic hydrogel because of its biocompatibility , ﬂexibility , and Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) approval for clinical use in humans [ 13 ] . PEG has been used in mechanobiology to study the effect of matrix stiffness on the spontaneity of cardiac contraction [ 14 ] , in drug delivery as a 3D scaffold for cell encapsulation [ 15 – 17 ] , and in many other tissue - engineering applications [ 18 ] . The ASC design leverages chemical surface modiﬁcations of the device to keep the electrostatic combs dry while interacting with a hydrated sample . We employ both computational and analytical models to compare device performance to common characterization methods . Design , operating principle , and fabrication We based our microelectrostatic tool and design on a new concept of operation for assessing microscale surface shear properties under hydrated conditions . The device was designed to apply shear loading on soft , hydrated samples while detecting the vertical contact force . Note , a mask error prevented testing of the vertical sensing features seen on the left side of the device image in ﬁgure 1 ; however , the device can still be positioned vertically and operated as described here . The ASC operates while placed perpendicular to the substrate such that the electrostatic comb drives exert micro newton shear forces on the substrate surface ( ﬁgure 2 ) . Foot A remains stationary while foot B is driven by the electrostatic actuator ; feet are 30 × 15 μ m 2 spaced 70 μ m apart . The ﬂexures that provide mechanical support to the moving shuttle are designed to be nine times stiffer in the out - of - plane direction , ensuring 2 J . Micromech .

Additionally , foot supports ( ﬁgure 1 ( b ) ) mediate the effects of off - axis forces on foot B . The variables and values introduced for the ASC in the following sections are deﬁned in table 1 . Operating principle of substrate shear characterization For interdigitated comb ﬁngers supported by silicon ﬂexures , the electrical force can be written as an empirically determined constant , α , multiplied by the applied voltage squared [ 19 ] , F electrical = α V 2 . ( 1 ) For a simple analytical model of a longitudinal electrostatic comb drive [ 20 ] α basic = Nt ε 2 d , ( 2 ) where , N is the number of ﬁnger pairs , t is the thickness of the device layer , ε is the dielectric constant , and d is distance between the electrodes . However , this simpliﬁed analytical model does not account for fringe ﬁelds . An example of an alternate model that assumes strong fringe ﬁeld effects yields another estimate [ 21 , 22 ] , α fringe = N ε π × (cid:2) 2 π t d − d + w l + ln (cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5) w d + 1 (cid:6) 2 − 1 (cid:7) (cid:4) 1 + 2 d w (cid:7) l + w d (cid:8)(cid:9) , ( 3 ) where , w is the width of the electrodes . In our system , assuming a no - slip conﬁguration when the device is in contact with the substrate , any displacement of the actuator tip ( x contact ) is identical to the displacement of the surface directly below the actuator tip . Thus , the device ﬂexures ( k device ) and substrate elasticity ( k substrate ) can be treated as two sets of springs in parallel , and F mechanical is given as F mechanical = ( k device + k substrate ) x contact . ( 4 ) The device spring constant , k device , was predicted for four springs in parallel using Euler – Bernoulli beam theory [ 23 – 25 ] for the entire ﬂexure ( equation ( 5 ) ) as k device = 4 E w 3 t l 3 . ( 5 ) Since the mechanical and electrical forces are equivalent under steady state operating conditions , the material property , k substrate , is extracted by rearranging the force balance to attain k substrate = α V 2 x contract − k device . ( 6 ) Fabrication The device was fabricated on silicon - on - insulator ( SOI ) wafers with device layer thickness of 15 μ m p - type boron - doped to 0 . 0025 (cid:5) cm , buried oxide of 1 μ m , and an undoped handle layer of 400 μ m ( ﬁgure 3 ) . This fabrication process was adapted from the three lithographic step process used 3 J . Micromech .

( 5 ) Individual devices are removed from the SOI wafer and are coated with a protective layer of HMDS silane . by Mukundan et al [ 26 ] : ( 1 ) to deﬁne sputtered aluminum electrical contacts ; ( 2 ) to pattern the frontside etching of devices in the handle layer using deep reactive ion etching ( DRIE ) ; and ( 3 ) to pattern the backside to release the devices using DRIE . After liquid hydroﬂuoric acid etching and critical point drying , we adhered the released device to a polymethyl - methacrylate board for ease of handling and wirebonded to a surface mount board with connections to power and readout circuitry . Using a custom LabVIEW R (cid:2) 8 . 6 interface and DAQ - D6036E , we controlled the voltage range , duration and step size . The signal was then ampliﬁed by 15 × through a Kepco ( Flushing , NY ) power ampliﬁer . To protect our device from water damage during interaction with hydrated samples , we treated our devices with a hydrophobic molecule , hexamethyldisiloxane ( HMDS ) . Vapor deposition of HMDS ( Sigma - Aldrich R (cid:2) , St Louis , MO ) successfully avoided device stiction that occurs from common immersion methods . We ﬁrst desiccated the device for 12 h in a sealed glass chamber containing 25 g of phosphorus pentaoxide ( P 2 O 5 ) powder ( Sigma - Aldrich R (cid:2) , St Louis , MO ) . Desiccation prevented agglomeration of HMDS and non - uniform layers induced by moisture [ 27 ] . We then transferred the device to another sealed glass chamber containing 50 μ l of HMDS for another 12 h . During each experiment , both chambers were enclosed in aluminum foil to block ambient light . A similar HDMS treatment was been reported to last for four months [ 28 ] . Device characterization Surface treatment characterization After treatment with HMDS , the surface contact angle increased to 90 ± 3 ◦ from an untreated value of 30 ± 3 ◦ ( Cam - Wafer Contact Angle Machine , Tantec , Lunderskow , Denmark ) . These results are comparable to reported values of 94 – 110 ◦ for other self - assembly conditions [ 29 ] . We also measured an average root - mean - square roughness of 2 . 5 nm after treatment using AFM ( AlphaSNOM300a WiTec , Ulm , Germany ) , which differed from the untreated roughness of 0 . 8 nm . This treated value is comparable to published values of 2 . 55 – 3 . 27 nm after HMDS treatment [ 30 ] . Direct water testing of the devices also conﬁrmed device hydrophobicity . When a drop of water was placed directly on the combs of the ASC , the hydrophobic coating drove beading and expulsion of water out of the combs in ﬁve successive trials ( monitored with upright microscope DMRXA2 , Leica Microsystems and Digital Camera C10600 , Hamamatsu ) ( supplementary information : video 1 ( available from stacks . iop . org / JMM / 23 / 085001 / mmedia ) ) . The ASC is not designed to be submerged in media ; rather , the long feet and hydrophobic barrier prevent water from wicking up into the combs . The ASC can thus operate near wetting surfaces to measure local shear stiffness of hydrogels . Device stiffness characterization Due to the inherent uncertainty in our fabrication processes , we empirically measured the ASC’s stiffness with a calibrated piezoresistive microcantilever [ 31 ] . The theoretical stiffness ( equation ( 5 ) ) and root - mean - sum of squares uncertainty in k device was 0 . 72 ± 0 . 65 N m − 1 based on expected ± 0 . 5 μ m dimensional tolerances for lithographic and etching steps . To determine the ASC stiffness more precisely , we used a piezoresistive microcantilever ( 750 μ m long × 7 μ m thick × 30 μ m wide ) with a calibrated stiffness value of 0 . 779 N m − 1 . In brief , tip deﬂection was converted into voltages via an instrumentation ampliﬁer ( AD8221 , Analog Devices , MA ) , a custom printed circuit board with a Wheatstone bridge , and an 8 kHz ﬁrst order low pass ﬁlter [ 31 ] . After 1000 × gain , the force sensitivity of the piezoresistive microcantilever was 512 . 9 V N − 1 . Under a stereomicroscope at 60 × magniﬁcation , we placed the tip of the cantilever against the base of the ASC foot ( ﬁgure 4 ) . In this conﬁguration , we could manipulate the cantilever die using a piezoelectric actuator stage with a 100 kHz feedback loop , while monitoring the output of the piezoresistive cantilever . In this manner , we could place the tip gently in contact with the ASC foot using a motorized z - linear stage ( T - LA50 - S Zaber Technologies , Canada ) and zero the output of the Wheatstone bridge . We then applied a known displacement to the cantilever die while measuring the force through the series springs of the cantilever and ASC . The calibrated stiffness of the ASC was 0 . 54 ± 0 . 04 N m − 1 4 J . Micromech .

The deﬂection signal of the piezoresistive cantilever indicates force – voltage ( F – V ) relationship of ASC is α = 0 . 019 μ N V − 2 . ( ii ) To measure the passive spring stiffness of the device ( k spring ) , the linear actuator moves the cantilever in the direction of the blue dotted arrow , while the device is held stationary on the stage . The device stiffness is extracted from these data , where k device = 0 . 54 N m − 1 . The apparent cantilever stiffness caused by the 10 ◦ offset from the vertical orientation was accounted for as noted by Park et al [ 31 ] . 5 10 15 0 2 4 6 8 10 F o r ce ( µ N ) Drivin g Volta g e ( V ) α = 0 . 048 µN / V frin g e 2 α = 0 . 019 µN / V 2 α = 0 . 010 µN / V basic 2 Figure 5 . F – V relationship of ACS exhibits expected quadratic behavior . A calibrated piezoresistive cantilever was used to quantify the resulting force due to voltage applied to the ACS—dotted black curve . The best ﬁt of the entire curve produced α = 0 . 019 μ N V − 2 ( R 2 = 0 . 996 ) . Small initial displacements are due to initial overlap of the electrodes ( 2 μ m ) and suggest an operating range above 5 V . The empirical data fall between a basic analytical model that ignores fringe ﬁelds ( α basic = 0 . 010 μ N V − 2 ) and an alternate model [ 21 , 22 ] yielding α fringe = 0 . 048 μ N V − 2 . ( mean ± s . d . , n = 4 replicate measurements ) , which was within the tolerance for the analytical spring stiffness . Force characterization Using this same conﬁguration , but now driving the ASC , we measured the force – voltage ( F – V ) rela - tionship of our device with the same cantilever ( ﬁgure 5 + supplementary information : video 2 ( available from stacks . iop . org / JMM / 23 / 085001 / mmedia ) ) . Fitting this quadratic curve , the coefﬁcient describing the F – V relation - ship was α = 0 . 019 μ N V − 2 ( R 2 = 0 . 996 ) . However , at low voltages ( < 4 V ) , the force was close to zero . We conﬁrmed that this initial behavior was not due to surface charge accu - mulation by repeatedly increasing and decreasing the applied voltage , at a rate less than 1 Hz . We also observed that device force and displacements yielded no appreciable hysteresis . While the empirical α curve lagged behind the α basic curve at low voltages , α exceeded α basic above 4 V . This displacement lag at low voltages is likely due to the small initial overlap dis - tance between the comb ﬁngers . With increasing voltage , the comb ﬁngers overlap increased and the effects of fringe ﬁelds began to contribute signiﬁcantly to the overall force generated . These forces helped to increase the empirical curve above the α basic curve , but not as great as in α fringe . From calibration , we determined a minimum force of 43 nN for the ASC and max - imum force error within 4 . 8 % of the empirically determined applied force . We also compared the empirically determined F – V relationshiptothetwocommonlyanalytical models introduced earlier ( equation ( 2 ) ) and ( equation ( 3 ) ) , using the values described in table 1 . The basic analytical model for comb - drive electrostatic actuators [ 20 ] yields α basic = 0 . 010 μ N V − 2 while the alternate model , which includes fringe ﬁeld effects [ 21 , 22 ] , yields α fringe = 0 . 048 μ N V − 2 . The empirical device performance ( α = 0 . 019 μ N V − 2 ) falls between a basic model that ignores fringe ﬁelds and the alternate model that incorporates strong fringe electric ﬁelds ( ﬁgure 5 ) . The overall yield of packaged and treated devices available for testing was only 16 % . The major causes of device losses were errors in the mask design , damages during fabrication ( particularly after removing the buried oxide layer ) , and difﬁculties with several post fabrication processes . For example , experimenting with various hydrophobic treatments , calibrating the device with the piezoresistive cantilever calibration , and calibrating polyacrylamide gels using the ASC . In total , there were 12 different actuator designs and we 5 J . Micromech .

( a ) Computational modeling of the silicone ( Stockwell Elastomerics ) under shear loading exerted by the feet of the ASC . While no shear loads are applied to the stationary foot , 45 μ N of shear force applied to the moveable actuator foot results in a displacement of 1 . 73 ± 0 . 1 μ m . The top image is a top down view of the displacement , while the bottom image is an isometric view , and contains the color - coded displacement scale bar . To enhance visualization , the deﬂection was scaled up by 2 . 5 times . ( b ) The ASC utilizes ﬁducial marker tracking to correlate effective shear stiffness to a shear modulus , G . The location of beads , x i , and projection of displacement , u i , in the direction of force , F mechanical , are used with equation ( 7 ) to derive shear modulus from ASC experiments . Beads directly behind the foot , e . g . bead 2 , were used preferentially in calculating G to satisfy point force assumptions . found three designs had spring stiffness and force generation capabilities suitable for the substrates we tested . Results and discussion Silicone shear characterization with nanoindentation and computational modeling validates utility of ASC To conﬁrm the utility of ASC , we compared data obtained from our approach to computational data where the material properties of silicone were obtained by standard nanoindentation techniques . For these experiments , we used a 250 μ m thick commercial elastomeric silicone polymer ( HT - 6240 , Stockwell Elastomerics , Philadelphia , PA ) . The polymer was chosen for its transparency and negligible water content . We investigated the silicone polymer via microscale indentation . For the microscale indentation , we used an MTS Nanoindenter R (cid:2) XP ( Eden Prairie , MN ) with a 500 μ m diameter ﬂat punch at an indentation speed of 120 nm s − 1 and indentation depth of 6 μ m . Using the Oliver Pharr expression [ 32 , 33 ] , we extracted a Young’s Modulus , E , for the silicone samples of 0 . 93 ± 0 . 08 MPa ( mean ± s . d . , n = 6 ) , suggesting a shear modulus of ∼ 320 kPa assuming near incompressibility ( v = 0 . 49 ) . To computationally compare the effective stiffness determined by the ASC to this microscale indentation value , we modeled our approach in COMSOL 4 . 0 ( ﬁgure 6 ( a ) ) . The silicone substrate was modeled using the structural elements physics category and solid mechanics ( solid ) subcategory . We used a stationary study to evaluate the model . The silicone was modeled as a ﬂat , linear elastic homogeneous substrate with elastic modulus E = 0 . 93 MPa , as empirically derived from nanoindentation experiments , and a Poisson’s ratio of v = 0 . 49 , a commonly used value for similar elastic solids [ 34 , 35 ] . The substrate depth was 1 mm , with its length and width inﬁnitely large compared to the ASC feet . We modeled the feet on top of the silicone as rigid bodies with two 30 μ m × 15 μ m surfaces with a 70 μ m distance between the feet , as on the actual device . To simulate the observed no - slip condition under the feet , we formed a union between the feet and silicone surfaces with a relative repair tolerance of 1 μ m . The feet were inﬁnitely tall and stiff in comparison to the silicone . We constrained the bottom of the silicone while we applied 45 μ N of shear face load distributed at the interface between one of the feet surfaces and the substrate ; the other foot was kept stationary . We applied the free tetrahedral mesh across the entire geometry with the mesh size predeﬁned as normal . The displacements of the computational model were consistent withempirical observations . For 45 μ N of tangential surface forces , the computational model and ASC experiments had displacements of 1 . 73 ± 0 . 1 μ m and 1 . 4 ± 0 . 5 μ m ( mean ± s . d . ) , respectively . These experimental data were obtained with ﬁve measurements taken > 0 . 5 mm apart from one another on a continuous silicone sample . These results validated our computational method for correlating the effective stiffness ( k substrate in N m − 1 ) as determined by ASC to well known material properties . In these experiments , the in plane stiffness , k substrate = 25 . 47 ± 1 . 42 N m − 1 corresponded with an elastic modulus of 0 . 93 MPa for the modeled silicone polymer . 6 J . Micromech .

These results also show that k 10wt % ( dotted black line ) has a higher effective stiffness than k 8wt % ( dashed black line ) for PEG gels ( 0 . 47 ± 0 . 06 N m − 1 and 0 . 26 ± 0 . 02 N m − 1 respectively ) . Note that stiffer substrates result in less displacement . Error bars show standard deviation of empirical measurements at representative voltages across all samples tested ( n = 5 ) . ( b ) Comparison of shear moduli of 8 wt % and 10 wt % PEG gels based on empirical ASC data and rheological measurements . Rheology and observations of displacements used for Cerruti’s formulation provide estimates of shear modulus ( left axis , n = 3 samples ) , while the ASC provides shear stiffness ( right axis , n = 5 ) conﬁrmed to correlate appropriately with G through a computational model . Analytical model of hydrogels correspond to ASC results To use the ASC to characterize hydrated substrates , we fabricated PEG hydrogels and correlated the ASC results with shear modulus using an analytical model . The hydrogels were made by diluting PEG diacrylate ( Mn = 700 , Sigma - Aldrich R (cid:2) , St Louis , MO ) to the desired concentrations ( 8 wt % and 10 wt % ) in phosphate buffered saline ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) containing 0 . 05 wt % 2 - methyl - 1 - [ 4 - ( hydroxyethoxy ) phenyl ] - 2 - methyl - 1 - propanone ( I2959 , Ciba Specialty Chemicals , Tarrytown , NY ) . Rain - X coated slides ( Rain - X R (cid:2) Houston , TX ) were ﬁxed at 1 mm apart , and 625 μ l of each PEG solution was injected between the parallel glass slides . Both the 8 wt % and 10 wt % gels contained a low density ( 10 − 5 ratio solid vol / vol ) of 2 . 7 μ m diameter green ﬂuorescent beads ( Duke Scientiﬁc , Palo Alto , CA ) . To promote migration of the beads to the bottom glass surface , the suspension was left undisturbed for 10 min . The gels were then polymerized under ultraviolet light exposure at 20 mW cm − 2 for 10 min ( λ UV centered at = 383 nm ) . We attempted nanoindentation experiments on the PEG gels , but unsurprisingly , the system was unable to stabilize during the surface approach . Sample compliance , nanoindenter stability range , and receding water meniscus make hydrogels difﬁcult to measure with this apparatus . We instead used rheology ( TA AR2000 , TA Instruments , New Castle DE ) to determine its shear modulus , G . Shear moduli were measured at 0 . 3 % strain rate and were consistent for frequencies tested ( 0 . 1 – 10 Hz ) . The shear moduli of 8 wt % and 10 wt % PEG gels were found to be G 8wt % = 5 . 13 ± 0 . 31 kPa and G 10wt % = 9 . 27 ± 1 . 70 kPa ( n = 3 samples ) . To correlate data obtained using the ASC with rheological measurements , we used the approach to Cerruti’s problem [ 36 , 37 ] to calculate shear modulus , G . Cerruti’s problem states that for an isotropic linear elastic material , the greater the distance between a particle and a point force , the less that particle moves . When operating the ASC at small displacements ( < 5 μ m ) on thick , homogeneous PEG gels at a rate of < 5 μ m s − 1 , these constraints are met and this equation can be used to estimate the shear modulus of the elastic half - space . To use this model on PEG gels , we observed the location and corresponding displacements of ﬂuorescent beads on the surface of the substrate ( ﬁgure 6 ( b ) ) . Bead displacements underneath the foot matched the observed foot displacement , conﬁrming a no - slip condition . We assume the force exerted by the ASC foot , at the trailing edge of the moving foot , can be modeled as a point force ( F mechanical ) at x = 0 , and the shear modulus , G , is given as a function of the x - component displacement , u , of a point located at some distance , x , from F mechanical : G = F mechanical 2 π xu . ( 7 ) Using this model , we extracted a shear moduli G Cerruti of 8 wt % and 10 wt % PEG gels as 3 . 57 ± 1 . 30 kPa and 9 . 89 ± 1 . 26 kPa , respectively . These values are consistent with our results by rheology ( ﬁgure 7 ( a ) ) . Student’s t - tests of G Cerruti and G Rheology conﬁrmed that there were no signiﬁcant differences between each of the 8 wt % and 10 wt % concentrations with p - values of p 8wt % = 0 . 167 and p 10wt % = 0 . 637 . With the ASC , we determined in plane k substrate values of k 8wt % = 0 . 26 ± 0 . 02 N m − 1 and k 10wt % = 0 . 47 ± 0 . 06 N m − 1 ( mean ± s . d . , n = 5 ) ( ﬁgure 7 ( b ) ) . 7 J . Micromech . Microeng . 23 ( 2013 ) 085001 G C Higgs et al When applying the Student’s t - test to compare k 8wt % to k 10wt % , we detected signiﬁcant differences between the two samples ( p = 0 . 012 for a one - sided test ) . This p - value was the same order of magnitude to the p - value from comparing G 8wt % Rheology and G 10wt % Rheology ( where p = 0 . 024 ) . Thus , local substrate shear stiffness characterized by the ASC was determined to be a reasonable proxy for shear modulus characterized globally by rheology , which can be useful to study local material behavior of heterogeneous substrates . Conclusions We have designed and demonstrated a system capable of characterizing surface shear behavior of polymers and hydrogels at the microscale . We calibrated a custom electrostatic actuator and used it to characterize a silicone polymer and hydrated PEG . Using material properties information attained from nanoindentation of the silicone polymer , we derived computational results that were consistent with the shear characterization results achieved with our method . The hydrophobic treatment of the actuator allowed probing of wet samples without succumbing to stiction . Our method was able to characterize the in plane stiffness of varying concentration of PEG and detect differences between their stiffness . Our MEMS - based approach to shear characterization provides a unique approach to investigate microdomains of soft , wetted samples . Through surface treatments , we have overcome the typical challenges of MEMS device stiction in hydrated environments , allowing for characterization of hydrogels and biological samples . By calibrating the device , we are able to apply precise ( nano newton range ) forces up to 45 μ N and investigate the shear response for substrates ranging from G = 5 – 320 kPa . This device and method enables a wide range of synthetic and biological materials to be characterized . Future outlook We have demonstrated an approach for characterizing soft materials based on three basic principles : a MEMS - based actuator , a surface coating to control adhesion and wetting , and optical monitoring of displacements . In this work , we apply these principles for successful characterization of silicone and hydrated PEG . This generalized approach of interfacing MEMS devices is not limited to PEG , but is suitable for the larger category of hydrogels and soft materials . Polyacrylamide gels , for example , are often used for investigating cell – substrate interactions including adhesion force studies , migration and proliferation studies , and cell morphology and differentiation [ 38 – 40 ] . However , we found that polyacrylamide gels exhibited undesirable adhesion to silicon , and thus damaged several devices during the attempted polyacrylamide calibration . In the future , a surface treatment speciﬁcally designed to reduce adhesion between the actuator and acrylamide functional groups would enable characterization of this commonly used substrate . In addition to characterizing culture substrates , this generalized approach could be used to characterize biological samples directly . Integration of displacement - and force - sensing features onto the MEMS device would extend the application of this approach to non - transparent substrates . Furthermore , horizontal force and displacement sensors would permit characterization of traditional time - dependent shear properties with cyclically applied loads . For example , such MEMS - based approaches could detect spatial changes in shear properties of cartilage to understand disease progression in osteoarthritis [ 41 ] , of tumors to inform cancer treatments [ 42 ] , or of blood vessels for insights into atherosclerosis [ 43 ] . While many microscale tools for indentation exist , we have demonstrated a MEMS - based system for shear characterization that enables high spatial resolution for probing the top surface of the substrate .
