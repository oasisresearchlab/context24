Cells in yellow are used for the analysis of seroprevalence at the corresponding time points . * previously seropositive results that are seronegative at T2 are not counted , as immunity might be still persisting , thus leading to a different further susceptibility and rates of infection than in those previously seronegative . * * previously seropositive results that are still seropositive at T2 are not counted in T2 , as they are more likely related to infections in spring ( before T1 ) rather than in summer and autumn ( between T1 and T2 ) . Raw proportion of seropositive results does not correspond to the seroprevalence estimated with Bayesian hierarchical models ( see Methods and Results ) , which additionally corrects for test accuracy and population structure parameters . Estimated seroprevalence T1 + T2 is higher than the sum of T1 and T2 seroprevalence – similarly as for the raw proportions of seropositive results , shown in this table – due to slightly different denominators used in the estimation at each time point .
