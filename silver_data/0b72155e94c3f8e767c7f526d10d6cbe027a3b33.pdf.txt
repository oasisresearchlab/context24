Anggoro 2 1 Department of Psychology , Worcester State University , Worcester , MA , United States , 2 Department of Psychology , College of the Holy Cross , Worcester , MA , United States Science museums aim to provide educational experiences for both children and adults . To achieve this goal , museum displays must convey scientiﬁcally - relevant relationships , such as the similarities that unite members of a natural category , and the connections between scientiﬁc models and observable objects and events . In this paper , we explore how research on comparison could be leveraged to support learning about such relationships . We describe how museum displays could promote educationally - relevant comparisons involving natural specimens and scientiﬁc models . We also discuss how these comparisons could be supported through the design of a display—in particular , by using similarity , space , and language to facilitate relational thinking for children and their adult companions . Such supports may be pivotal given the informal nature of learning in museums . Keywords : relational learning , science museum , comparison , informal learning , cognitive support INTRODUCTION Science museums aim to provide visitors with education as well as entertainment . In this paper , we consider how museum exhibits could be designed to promote cognitive processes that are instrumental to science learning . We focus on the process of comparison —a powerful mechanism that applies to a wide range of topics . We discuss how museum exhibits can promote comparisons to educate and engage visitors , and describe cognitive supports for comparison that are applicable to museums and other informal learning contexts . RELATIONAL THINKING IN A SCIENCE MUSEUM Science learning involves relational thinking . For example , understanding the scope and boundaries of natural categories involves recognizing how members of a category are similar to one another and distinct from members of other groups . There are also the deeper evolutionary relationships between organisms that shed light on the process of natural selection . Many other scientiﬁc categories are deﬁned by abstract relations , having few ( if any ) overt features in common ( Richland and Simms , 2015 ; Goldwater and Schalk , 2016 ) . For example , the ripening of a banana bears little resemblance to the melting of arctic permafrost , yet both share the abstract structure of a positive feedback system , a process perpetuated by its own eﬀects . Relational thinking is Jee and Anggoro Designing Exhibits also involved in learning about scientiﬁc models , which represent key properties and relationships inherent to an object or system ( Clement , 2008 ; Sibley , 2009 ; Kastens and Rivet , 2010 ; Stull and Hegarty , 2016 ) . Comprehending these models involves understanding the spatial , temporal , and causal structure that is represented , as well as the relationship between the model and the real world ( Jee and Anggoro , 2019 ) . A key question is how to promote scientiﬁcally - relevant relational thinking in the context of the museum . We propose a general approach based on cognitive and educational research on relational thinking—namely , the use of comparison . COMPARISON PROMOTES RELATIONAL THINKING Comparison involves aligning the elements of two representations according to the role they play in a common system of relations—a process of structural alignment ( Gentner , 1983 ) . For example , in the comparison between the atom ( the less - familiar “target” case ) and the solar system ( the more - familiar “base” ) , structural relations , like the orbiting of smaller objects around a larger central object , are brought into focus . Superﬁcial features , like the absolute size of the objects involved , fade into the background . Thus , the nucleus of the atom is placed in correspondence with the Sun—not because they look alike , but because these objects occupy a central position and attract surrounding objects in their respective systems . Through comparison , the broader relational structure that unites the two cases—that of a central force system—can be abstracted , forming a new relational concept ( Gentner and Smith , 2012 ; Goldwater and Schalk , 2016 ) . However , if the two cases are not explicitly compared , such abstractions may go unrealized ( Gick and Holyoak , 1983 ; Kurtz et al . , 2001 ; Richland et al . , 2007 ; Star and Rittle - Johnson , 2009 ; Goldwater and Gentner , 2015 ) . Comparison is a powerful mechanism that has been used to meet a broad range of educational goals ( Richland et al . , 2007 ; Rittle - Johnson and Star , 2007 ; Alﬁeri et al . , 2013 ; Jee et al . , 2013 ) . Comparison has also proven eﬀective across a range of age levels , enhancing young children’s and infants’ relational thinking in a variety of domains ( Gentner , 2010 ; Hespos et al . , 2020 ) . In the present paper , we explore how museum displays could be designed to promote scientiﬁcally - informative comparisons involving widely - used materials : natural specimens and scientiﬁc models . We ﬁrst consider how pairs of specimens could be used to promote learning of critical category information , including within - category variability , category distinctions , and shared structure that points to deep evolutionary relations . We then turn to learning about real - world causal systems through scientiﬁc models , and consider how pairing a model with a second , related representation could clarify the relationship between the model and the real world , and facilitate analogical reasoning about unfamiliar causal systems . When it comes to museum - based learning—which is more self - directed and less structured than formal instruction ( Hurst et al . , 2019 ) —it cannot be taken for granted that visitors will engage in relevant comparisons , even when an informative pair of items is presented in a display . Nor can it be assumed that children’s accompanying caregivers will provide appropriate assistance . In fact , parents can be unmotivated to provide an “educational experience” for their children ( Collaboration for Ongoing Visitor Experience Studies ( COVES ) , 2018 ) , and may underestimate the educational value of museum exhibits ( Song et al . , 2017 ) . Methods that promote children’s learning , and encourage adults’ involvement in this learning , are crucial in this setting ( Pattison and Bailey , 2016 ) . Thus , we also consider how aspects of an exhibit display—including the visual appearance of the specimens or models in the display , how the display is structured , and how the display is described in surrounding signs , labels , and captions—could be designed to facilitate the structural alignment process for visitors . EXHIBITS THAT PROMOTE COMPARISONS INVOLVING NATURAL SPECIMENS Natural specimens—skeletons , fossils , rocks , shells , etc . —are a hallmark of science museums . These objects provide visitors with the opportunity to observe the diversity of life on Earth , a central aim of current science education frameworks , such as the Next Generation Science Standards ( National Research Council , 2012 , 2013 ) . Exposure to natural specimens could also help to oﬀset the “taxonomic impediment” identiﬁed by the Convention on Biological Diversity—i . e . , the decline in taxonomic expertise , resources , and public and policy - maker awareness ( e . g . , Klopper et al . , 2002 ) . Hence , the eﬀective display of natural objects is of central importance to a museum’s educational goals . Natural specimens are displayed in a variety of ways , from crowded display cases to large - scale dioramas that reconstruct scenes from nature . In order to increase the biodiversity on display , museums often prioritize the inclusion of diﬀerent species over showing multiple specimens of the same kind ( Schilthuizen et al . , 2015 ) . The Spectrum of Life Display in the Hall of Biodiversity at the American Museum of Natural History , for example , contains ∼ 1 , 500 specimens , most of them representing unique species . Yet , there are potential advantages to displaying multiple examples from the same category . When shown only a single category example , visitors may focus on irrelevant details . Displaying a pair of category members enables visitors to compare them , guiding attention toward relational structure . Indeed , children tend to sort objects in terms of taxonomic relations ( e . g . , vegetable ) over perceptual features ( e . g . , round ) after comparing two category members ( Gentner and Namy , 1999 ) . Displaying multiple category examples could also illuminate aspects of natural kinds that may otherwise be overlooked or misunderstood by visitors . For example , people often underestimate the variability that exists within biological categories ( Shtulman and Schulz , 2008 ) . Tigers may be thought to have about the same number of stripes , or ladybugs the Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 2 March 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 636030 Jee and Anggoro Designing Exhibits same number of spots . Adults who underestimate within - category variation tend to have a poorer understanding of evolution ( Shtulman and Schulz , 2008 ) . Providing visitors with the opportunity to compare two category members that diﬀer from one another—e . g . , a tiger with many stripes vs . one with few—could help them appreciate the amount of variability that exists within biological categories . Displaying multiple examples can also convey systematic variability within a category . For example , biological males and females of a species often have characteristically diﬀerent traits , known as sexual dimorphism . Birds provide a number of striking examples . In northern cardinals , for instance , adult males have a bright red body and black coloring around the beak , whereas adult females are pale brown with reddish wings ( Figure 1A ) . In other birds , like mandarin ducks and peacocks , the disparity in coloration is even greater . These within - category diﬀerences are driven by natural selection—in particular , females’ preference for ornamental coloration in males ( e . g . , Hill , 2006 ) . Yet , these interesting and informative patterns are eﬀectively ignored when only a single specimen is on display . In fact , visitors may form a skewed impression , because male specimens are displayed approximately twice as often as female specimens ( Mendenhall et al . , 2020 ) . The comparison of a male and female category member can draw attention to systematic variability , and , if multiple kinds of animal are compared , shed light on broader patterns in nature . Paired examples can also help visitors distinguish between members of diﬀerent categories . For example , students were better able to learn a geological structure , such as fault , when an example of the category was shown alongside a visually - similar image that did not contain this structure ( Jee et al . , 2013 ) . Similarly , medical students learned to diagnose diseases from X - rays more accurately when a disease example was shown with a similar but healthy example as they learned ( Kok et al . , 2013 ) . Encouraging visitors to compare specimens from diﬀerent categories— contrasting cases—could help them to notice key taxonomic diﬀerences . This may be especially beneﬁcial when two categories are readily confused . Figure 1B shows a display that includes a butterﬂy and a moth , two insects belonging to the order Lepidoptera . Although similar in appearance , butterﬂies and moths can be distinguished by several anatomical features , including their antennae ( butterﬂy : thin with bulbed ends ; moth : feathery / saw - edged ) , and body shape ( butterﬂy : thin ; moth : thick ) . These category - distinguishing features stand out when the two examples are directly compared . Contrasts can also promote relational concept learning . For example , Strouse and Ganea ( 2021 ) found that 3 - year - old children were more likely to learn about camouﬂage from a storybook in which a camouﬂaged animal ( light animal on light background ) was compared with a similar , noncamouﬂaged animal ( light animal on dark background ) . Finally , pairs of specimens could be used to shed light on the deep , evolutionary connections between diﬀerent species . For example , dolphins are very diﬀerent from most other mammals in terms of their appearance and habitat . Displaying the bones of a dolphin ﬂipper alongside those of a human hand permits a comparison that illuminates a remarkably similar skeletal structure . Along these lines , comparing the neck bones of a human and a giraﬀe ( Figure 1C ) reveals that each has the same number of cervical vertebrae ( seven ) despite dramatic diﬀerences neck length—a phenomenon known as evolutionary stasis ( e . g . , Williams , 1992 ) . It can also be eﬀective to have visitors compare a specimen against their own body . Callanan et al . ( 2016 ) found that children and adult museumgoers engaged in deeper conversations about a fossilized mammoth femur when the exhibit enabled a visitor to line up their own leg with the fossil . When the fossil was displayed in a case , visitors often merely labeled it a “bone . ” When visitors could sit down next to the fossil to compare its massive size against their own leg , they used diﬀerent terms , including the speciﬁc name of the bone ( “femur” ) , and the extinct animal to which it belonged ( “mammoth” ) . Natural specimens can be paired in a number of ways in order to promote scientiﬁcally - informative comparisons . In addition to natural objects , museums often display scientiﬁc models that represent causal systems , such as plate tectonics , state changes of matter , and planetary motion . Comparisons between multiple models / visual representations could help visitors understand these models and make important connections to the real world . EXHIBITS THAT PROMOTE COMPARISONS INVOLVING SCIENTIFIC MODELS Scientiﬁc models—such as physical replicas and computer simulations—are representations of real - world systems ( National Research Council , 2012 ) . In such models , key elements of a system can be emphasized , and irrelevant details removed ; objects that are imperceptibly small or large can be brought into view ; events that unfold too quickly or too slowly to notice can be slowed down or sped up . These aspects of models can help to explain how the world works ( Clement , 2008 ; Sibley , 2009 ; Jee et al . , 2010 ; Kastens and Rivet , 2010 ; National Research Council , 2012 ; Stull and Hegarty , 2016 ) . Models and modeling are therefore regarded as important crosscutting concepts in science education ( National Research Council , 2012 ) . Models are widespread in science museums—from reconstructions of extinct species to interactive simulations of natural systems and human - made machines . We focus on models of causal processes , especially those that depict real - world systems . Like a good analogy , a good scientiﬁc model reﬂects the relational structure of the system it represents ( Sibley , 2009 ) . The classic science fair volcano—which erupts when vinegar and baking soda are poured into a crater at its top—is a poor scientiﬁc model , because it misrepresents the cause of a volcanic eruption . Of course , even well - designed models can be challenging to understand . Museum models that are highly abstract , with little resemblance to nature , can be diﬃcult for visitors to grasp ( Afonso and Gilbert , 2007 ) . However , models that are highly realistic may obscure relevant properties or behaviors in a sea of trivial details ( Uttal et al . , 1997 ; Goldstone and Son , 2005 ; Kokkonen and Schalk , 2020 ) . With a single model , it is hard to strike an ideal balance between emphasizing Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 3 March 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 636030 Jee and Anggoro Designing Exhibits FIGURE 1 | Examples of comparisons involving natural specimens . ( A ) A male and female northern cardinal . Photographs by Andy Morffew ; ( B ) a butterﬂy and a moth ; ( C ) the cervical vertebrae of a human and a giraffe . Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 4 March 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 636030 Jee and Anggoro Designing Exhibits relational structure—which is central to deep learning—and retaining realistic surface details—which ground the model in the real world ( Fyfe et al . , 2014 ) . Displays that enable visitors to compare a model with another model or visual representation could provide a way to overcome this challenge . Displaying multiple representations of the same object or system—one showing how the object or system appears in real life , and the other emphasizing relational structure—could be eﬀective in many cases . For example , geological structures can be diﬃcult for novices to distinguish in natural contexts ( Jee et al . , 2014 ) . Showing a photo of a geological structure along with an abstract model of the structure , as in Figure 2A ( from Marshak , 2009 ) , can help students make the connection between realistic and abstract representations . Designing an exhibit such that a concrete / perceptually - rich model is shown before an abstract / idealized model may be especially helpful—a sequence known as concreteness fading ( Goldstone and Son , 2005 ; Fyfe et al . , 2014 ) . Encountering a perceptually - rich representation ﬁrst can help to ground and disambiguate the more abstract model that is seen later on . In terms of structural alignment , the concrete representation serves as the base , and the more abstract representation , the target ( Kokkonen and Schalk , 2020 ) . In a museum , concreteness fading could be accomplished in a number of ways—a digital display that transitions from concrete to abstract at the push of a button or slide of a bar , or using a projector to overlay a realistic image onto an abstract physical model , etc . When scientiﬁc models depict imperceptible objects or events , such as molecular structures or planetary motion , it may be crucial to connect the model to objects and events that can be experienced in everyday life . Displaying the behavior of the model alongside a related observable event could allow visitors to better appreciate these connections . In a recent study , 3rd - grade students were instructed to compare a model of Earth rotation alongside a synced - up video of the Sun’s apparent motion in the sky . This enabled the students to see how the sunrise we observe when a location on Earth becomes exposed to sunlight is due to our planet’s eastward rotation . The students who could compare the modeled and observable events learned more about the cause of the day / night cycle than students who received lessons involving only the model ( Jee and Anggoro , 2019 ) . A similar approach could be implemented in a museum using a solar system model synced with a nearby display of the “sky” as in Figure 2B . As Earth rotates in the model solar system , the accompanying display shows the view from a location on Earth’s surface . Other counterintuitive scientiﬁc ideas , such as the link between molecular activity and state changes of matter , could be facilitated through similar pairings of models and more familiar or intuitive visual representations ( e . g . , Samarapungavan et al . , 2017 ; Stieﬀ , 2019 ) . The use of multiple models / representations could also enhance cross - domain analogies—comparisons between examples from diﬀerent subject areas . When a model represents an unfamiliar system ( the target ) , an analogy to a familiar example ( the base ) can help visitors understand how the model works . For example , sound waves may be compared to ripples in a pond ; the mitochondria of a cell may be compared to a power plant ; the convection of Earth’s mantle to a boiling pot of water , etc . Analogies like these are often used to communicate scientiﬁc ideas ( e . g . , Glynn , 1991 ; Harrison and Treagust , 2006 ; Jee et al . , 2010 ; Holyoak and Lee , 2017 ; see also the crowd - sourced list of science analogies at https : / / tinyurl . com / wrcp725 ) . In museum exhibits , analogies often appear in text form , such as a sign or caption for a display ( Valle and Callanan , 2006 ) . However , text - based analogies rely on a visitor’s accurate recollection of the base domain , and also their ability to map the base and target . Both of these processes are resource - demanding and error - prone ( Richland et al . , 2007 ; Simms et al . , 2018 ) . Adding a visual representation of the base can help learners grasp an analogy , and reduce the cognitive burden of retrieval and mapping ( Richland and McDonough , 2010 ) . Indeed , 4th - grade students gained more knowledge from analogical instruction about scientiﬁc processes when both the base and target cases were visually represented as opposed to showing the target alone ( Matlen et al . , 2011 ) . Figure 2C shows one of the visual analogies from Matlen and colleagues’ study—a boiling pot of water ( base ) and mantle convection ( target ) . When an exhibit includes cross - domain analogies such as this , adding a visual representation of the source example may help visitors perform the intended structural alignment . EXHIBIT - BASED SUPPORTS FOR COMPARISON AND ALIGNMENT Exhibits that display multiple specimens , models , and other visual representations provide visitors with the opportunity to engage in scientiﬁcally - informative comparisons . Yet , visitors may require additional cognitive supports to fully beneﬁt from these opportunities . In the informal learning context of a museum , it may be crucial to incorporate supports for comparison into the exhibit itself . A number of exhibit - based supports could facilitate comparisons involving natural specimens and models . Surface similarity is one key factor . Superﬁcially similar items are easier to align , and are helpful for initiating relational learning ( Thompson and Opfer , 2010 ; Gentner et al . , 2011 ; Jee et al . , 2013 ) . If the goal is to highlight diﬀerences , high - similarity contrasting items can draw a visitor’s attention to the features that vary between the items ( Gentner and Markman , 1994 ; Sagi et al . , 2012 ; Strouse and Ganea , 2021 ) . Though natural specimens are not entirely manipulable , it may be possible to select examples with high overall similarity to help visitors perform the intended comparison . The cardinals in Figure 1A , for example , are similar in many respects—size , orientation , background , etc . —which helps to draw attention to the diﬀerence in color . Likewise , the size , color , material , and other aspects of a model could be controlled to enhance its similarity to other representations in a display . For example , when a museum display included models of a stable and unstable building that were highly similar in height , color , construction materials , etc . , 6 – 8 - year - olds were more likely to learn the key feature of the stable building—a diagonal brace ( Gentner et al . , 2016 ) . If increasing the perceptual similarity of the two models is not a viable option , comparison can be supported by adding a third example that is halfway between the two in terms of its appearance .

Another consideration is how a pair of related items are arranged in space . To facilitate comparison , two objects should be placed in close proximity , and perhaps visually segregated from other items in a display , e . g . , by placing a boundary around them . This spatial contiguity could help visitors to realize that a meaningful relationship exists , and makes it easier to examine the Frontiers in Psychology | www . frontiersin . org 6 March 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 636030 Jee and Anggoro Designing Exhibits two cases simultaneously ( Mayer and Moreno , 2003 ) . Another spatial consideration is the relative placement of the items in the display ( Richland et al . , 2007 ; Richland and Simms , 2015 ; Matlen et al . , 2020 ) . For pairs of specimens or models with a vertical orientation ( e . g . , part A above part B , etc . ) , side - by - side placement is optimal for comparison ( Matlen et al . , 2020 ) . For those with a horizontal orientation ( part A beside part B , etc . ) , placing one above the other is optimal . In Figure 1C , for example , the human and giraﬀe pair are placed in optimal fashion for alignment—specimens with vertical orientation placed next to each other . Spatial factors can also support relational thinking and learning from interactive exhibits . For exhibits in which visitors are invited to compare themselves against a museum specimen— a dinosaur’s footprint , a condor’s wingspan , a mammoth’s leg bone , etc . —deeper learning is more likely to occur when the visitor can place their body in an optimal position for the alignment ( Callanan et al . , 2016 ) . Exhibits that include levers , knobs , and buttons can be easier to understand and control when they conform to commonplace metaphors between space and quantity , such as “more is up” and “less is down” ( Lakoﬀ and Johnson , 1980 ; Allen , 2004 ) . Spatial structure can also support reasoning about relational rules that govern a natural or artiﬁcial system . For example , 3 - year - olds were more likely to infer a relational rule—e . g . , that two of the same objects were needed to activate a machine—when the two objects were inserted into openings at either side of the machine ( highlighting their relation ) as opposed to being placed on top of it ( Walker et al . , 2020 ) . Language provides another useful support for comparison . Labels , captions , and other verbal information can clarify connections between examples . Even young children beneﬁt from verbal prompts to compare , and learn abstract relational categories more eﬃciently when category members are labeled with the same term ( Waxman and Markow , 1995 ; Gentner and Namy , 1999 ; Gentner et al . , 2011 ) . When causal processes are displayed in multiple visual representations , children learn more when prompted to think about the relationships between the representations ( Hansen and Richland , 2020 ) . Labels , captions , instructions , etc . can also beneﬁt pre - literate children by inﬂuencing how their older caregivers behave at an exhibit . Simple signs in a display can help parents appreciate the educational value of museum exhibits ( Song et al . , 2017 ) . This awareness could lead caregivers to capitalize on educational opportunities that they and their child might otherwise miss . When children engage in an exhibit together with an adult caregiver , they tend to demonstrate more critical scientiﬁc thinking , such as comparing diﬀerent sources of evidence ( Crowley et al . , 2001 ) . Parents may produce spontaneous analogies to help their children grasp the scientiﬁc ideas they encounter ( Valle and Callanan , 2006 ) . Children also learn more when their parent uses language that highlights key features or relations—e . g . , referring to diagonal bracing ( “angle , ” “brace , ” “cross - beam , ” “diagonal” ) while building a model tower ( Gentner et al . , 2016 ) . Parents’ nonverbal cues , such as gestures , could also help to draw attention to relevant relationships and support the alignment process ( Alibali et al . , 2013 ; Richland , 2015 ) . Labels and other text may be most eﬀective when placed within a display , in close proximity to related specimens and models , as opposed to outside the display on a placard— another application of the spatial contiguity principle ( Mayer and Moreno , 2003 ) . This proximity can help to ensure that visitors notice the verbal information before engaging with the exhibit materials . Indeed , parents’ use of causal language predicted their children’s productive use of exhibit materials ( e . g . , building machines with gears ) only if it occurred before children used the materials ( Callanan et al . , 2019 ) . FURTHER THOUGHTS ON COMPARISON AND SCIENCE LEARNING Our discussion of comparison emphasized the educational potential of promoting an underutilized cognitive tool through the design of museum displays . As we move to test our comparison - based approach in a museum setting , we recognize that designing a successful exhibit involves numerous considerations besides meeting educational goals . Children’s museum exhibits should be interesting and entertaining , they should engage visitors at diﬀerent age levels who may interact with an exhibit alone or together ( Rigney and Callanan , 2011 ) , and they should be accessible to children and adults with diverse backgrounds and abilities ( Shaby et al . , 2016 ) . Ideally , methods that promote informative comparisons in a museum will enhance children’s thinking and learning without sacriﬁcing their enjoyment , exploration , and engagement . Indeed , without willful engagement , visitors have little chance of beneﬁting from even the most eﬀective visual displays . Thus , to better evaluate the comparison - based approach , we must use metrics relevant to museum exhibit practitioners , such as tracking visitor groups’ time spent at the exhibit , their verbal and nonverbal references to the materials in an exhibit , and the roles that caregivers take in supporting children’s learning ( Crowley et al . , 2001 ; Haden et al . , 2016 ; Callanan et al . , 2017 ; Horn , 2018 ) . Though our focus is on museum - based learning , methods that promote relational thinking could be applied broadly in education . Research on math and science learning has revealed that relatively small changes to existing materials—such as the number and type of practice problems that students receive , or the spatial layout of a science diagram—can make a diﬀerence in students’ mastery of the material ( Higgins , 2020 ) . Encouragingly , when an instructional sequence sets the stage for structural alignment , children can recognize and transfer relational structure without explicit guidance ( Sidney , 2020 ) . By further incorporating cognitive supports into educational materials and lessons , remote and independent student learning—which have soared during the COVID - 19 pandemic—could be made more eﬀective and manageable for teachers , students , and caregivers . More broadly , this approach would make science more accessible for young children who may otherwise receive little instructional support at home or at school .
