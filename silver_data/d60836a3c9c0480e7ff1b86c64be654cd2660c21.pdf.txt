Keywords : Digital government research Cross - boundary research collaboration Dynamics of research collaboration Network coevolution Social network analysis 1 . Introduction Digital government , as a ﬁ eld of study , has matured and developed into a discipline over the past two decades . More than 5500 peer - reviewed journal publications have accumulated as of 2013 ( Scholl & Dwivedi , 2014 ) and both the theoretical foundations and methodologi - cal rigor of thesestudies have continuously improved . Recent studies on digital government researchers and linkages among them have shown that cross - boundary research collaboration was one of the main factors that drove the growth in digital government knowledge ( e . g . , Khan & Park , 2013 ; Scholl , 2009 ) . This trend in cross - boundary collaboration will extend into future digital government studies and will incorporate additional relevant dis - ciplines as the ﬁ eld continues to grow for three reasons . First , digital government by nature is multidisciplinary . Although the details of its conceptualization in the literature vary , digital government generally refers to the use of information and communication technologies ( ICTs ) in government in order to provide better public services and im - prove relationships with citizens , civil society , and the private sector ( Reddick , 2012 ) . Thus , research on digital government by de ﬁ nition lies at the intersection of government , society , and information technol - ogies and deals with multi - dimensional issues that require multidisci - plinary perspectives and analysis ( Khan & Park , 2013 ; Scholl & Dwivedi , 2014 ) . Second , the increasing complexity of digital govern - ment environments calls for cross - boundary knowledge sharing and convergence to tackle the challenging problems that governments face . The speed and scope of changes in ICTs make it dif ﬁ cult , if not im - possible , for any individual or single organization tohave a ﬁ rm grasp of the available knowledge in a limited time span . Some examples are the emerging technologies of arti ﬁ cial intelligence , the Internet of things , and data analytics , all of which have great potential for government op - erations , but simultaneously introduce unprecedented challenges and uncertainty when they are applied to e - services , information acquisi - tion , or application systems in the public sector . Moreover , the concom - itant changes in the social , economic , and political contexts of governments give rise to greater levels of complexity in digital govern - ment research and practice and pose questions that are dif ﬁ cult to an - swer ( see Dunleavy , Margetts , Bastow , & Tinkler , 2006 ) . Finally , this trendwillcontinuebecauseadvancementsinICTsmitigatecommunica - tion barriers imposed by different time zones and long distances , which increases the possibility of knowledge sharing and coproduction across geographical boundaries . Despite the paramount importance of cross - boundary collaboration , much remains to be uncovered about the emergence and development Government Information Quarterly xxx ( 2016 ) xxx – xxx ⁎ Corresponding author .

Since Smith conducted a pioneering study in 1958 , research collaboration has been a popular research topic among scholars . However , previous studies focus on the micro - and macro - level factors that affect the formation of research partnerships and their effect on research performance , with topics ranging from the motivation of individual researchers ( e . g . , Fox & Faver , 1984 ; Melin , 2000 ; Trier & Molka - Danielsen , 2013 ) , social , physical , and institutional pressures on the individual , such as re - search policies ( e . g . , Heinze & Kuhlmann , 2008 ) , to physical distance ( e . g . , Hoekman , Frenken , & Tijssen , 2010 ; Khan & Park , 2013 ; Kraut , Egido , & Galegher , 1990 ) . Meso - level factors , particularly social net - works among the individuals , have rarely been considered ( with the exception of a more recent study by Khan and Park ( 2013 ) who at - tempt to identify the patterns of connectivity among digital govern - ment researchers at the country , regional , and organizational levels ) . Collaborations of all kinds , including research collaborations , are “ in - trinsically social processes ” ( Katz & Martin , 1997 , p . 4 ) . For collabo - ration to achieve a common goal , research agents ( i . e . , individuals and organizations ) and their research partners must exist , and many of their interactions and communications may be crucial to success ( Crane , 1972 ; He , Geng , & Campbell - Hunt , 2009 ; Katz & Martin , 1997 ; Kraut et al . , 1990 ) . Prior collaboration experience and resource sharing between researchers may affect the emer - gence , maintenance , and resolution of the partnership ( Katz & Martin , 1997 ; Lee & Bozeman , 2005 ; Milne , 2000 ; Smith , 1958 ) . Studies that take a social network perspective , including Khan and Park ( 2013 ) ; Rodriguez and Pepe ( 2008 ) , and Pepe ( 2011 ) , however , provide us with only limited insight into the evolution process from social networking to a formal research collaboration . The micro and macro foundations of research collaborations can help us understand why people choose to collaborate . But many important questions re - main unanswered , such as why networks with individuals who are initially motivated to participate ultimately fail to maintain over time and how social connections between participants encourage or hinder digital government research collaborations . In this article , we intend to bridge this knowledge gap by investigating the process by which a digital government research group , whose members have various disciplinary , organizational , and geographical backgrounds , emerges and evolves into an integrated and productive research network . It focuses on the social dynamics of cross - boundary research collaboration and identi ﬁ es key variables that can affect the emergence and development of research collaboration networks for future empirical consideration . Specially , we investigate the following three questions . RQ1 : . How does a cross - boundary research collaboration network for digital government emerge ? RQ2 : . How do social connections , such as face - to - face communication , grant - sharing , and pastcoauthorship , affect thegrowth of the re - search collaboration network ? RQ3 : . How is the growth of the research collaboration network related to knowledge coproduction among the members ? We conduct a single case study , utilizing both qualitative and quantitative data , including social network data collected from a working group of 18 digital government researchers and prac - titioners from 7 disciplines , 11 organizations , and 3 North Amer - ican countries . The paper is organized into six sections , including the foregoing introduction . Based on a review of existing literature , the follow - ing section discusses prior research on research collaboration networks . Section 3 describes the research design and methods used in this study . Section 4 presents the main research ﬁ ndings , and Section 5 presents a set of propositions that characterize the dynamic nature of network - based , cross - boundary digital gov - ernment research collaboration . This paper concludes by discussing the limitations of the present study that could be ad - dressed in future research . 2 . Research collaboration and networks This section summarizes the advantages that prior studies have claimed for networks forms of collaboration . In addition , it discusses the connection between the emergence and evolution of research col - laboration networks and the multiplexity of social relations within them . 2 . 1 . Bene ﬁ ts of research collaboration in networks Why do researchers choose to collaborate in research , rather than workingalone ? Theanswers tothis question have been well document - ed in the literature . The ﬁ rst and most obvious advantage of conducting research in a group is to acquire new knowledge resources for one ' s self and enhance research productivity through knowledge conversion . Due to increased scienti ﬁ c specialization , the information , skills , and tech - niques necessary for scienti ﬁ c knowledge creation today easily surpass the knowledge resources possessed by an individual researcher or de - veloped within a single discipline . By working with others , researchers can learn new skills and techniques that cannot be easily transferred through documented materials , so - called tacit knowledge ( He et al . , 2009 ) . Through collaboration , research groups consisting of individuals who have different skills , techniques , know - how , and domain knowl - edge can have a higher chance of creating signi ﬁ cant scienti ﬁ c knowl - edge ( He et al . , 2009 ) . Many empirical studies have demonstrated such bene ﬁ ts . For example , Melin ( 2000 ) surveyed 195 coauthors of peer - reviewed journal publications ; they ranked the opportunity to learn new knowledge from their partners and increase the quality of re - search through the partnerships as the foremost bene ﬁ t of research col - laboration . Lee and Bozeman ( 2005 ) revealed a strong positive association between the number of collaborators and the number of publications , thereby increasing the quantity of research products . Even when researchers do not seriously suffer due to more limited knowledge resources , group - based research programs can be bene ﬁ cial in fostering the ef ﬁ ciency of the members through division of labor and other forms of resource - sharing ( Fox & Faver , 1984 ; Leydesdorff & Wagner , 2008 ) . Usually research is conducted through a set of labor - and time - consuming sequential activities , including research design , data collection , data processing , data analysis , and presentation of the results . Coordination and division of the tasks can reduce duplication of efforts to generate knowledge that others already possess or acquire knowledge that is new , but necessary for multiple researchers to pro - ceed with the research project ( Fox & Faver , 1984 ) . In addition , easy ac - cess to resources that others possess , such as data , research equipment , and grants , is one of the primary reasons for participation in collabora - tive research ( Lee & Bozeman , 2005 ; Melin , 2000 ; Smith , 1958 ) . Price ( 1965 ) argued that coauthoring papers is the product of symbiotic rela - tionships among scientists who share ﬁ nancial , physical , and profes - sional resources ; economic , rather than intellectual , dependence can better account for the emergence of research partnerships as represent - ed by coauthorship . On the other hand , the literature has shed light on the noneconomic advantages of research partnerships . Fox and Faver ( 1984 ) claimed that researchcollaboration can arise out of researchers ' motivationto build a collegialenvironment . According to them , evenwhen a division of labor or other types of economic bene ﬁ ts are not expected , researchers col - laborate in research to escape from isolation . Visibility , recognition , and popularity in academic communities are social bene ﬁ ts that can drive research collaboration ( Katz & Martin , 1997 ; Melin , 2000 ) . In par - ticular , through social networks gained via research collaboration , re - searchers can get information on research collaboration opportunities 2 M . Ku et al . / Government Information Quarterly xxx ( 2016 ) xxx – xxx Please cite this article as : Ku , M . , et al . , The emergence and evolution of cross - boundary research collaborations : An explanatory study of social dynamics in a digital govern . . . , Government Information Quarterly ( 2016 ) , http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . giq . 2016 . 07 . 005 andexposuretoabroaderrangeofscientists ( Barabásietal . , 2002 ; Heet al . , 2009 ; Melin , 2000 ; Newman , 2001 , 2004 ) . Moreover , arecordofsuc - cessful research collaboration can signal that a researcher is well - seasoned with experience , valuable resources , and positive social char - acteristics ( Merton , 1968 ) . Research collaboration in networks may provide members with dis - tinct bene ﬁ ts over separate dyadic relations . Although their focus is not on research collaboration , social network scholars such as Burt ( 1992 ) , Coleman ( 1988 ) , andGranovetter ( 1973 ) haveadvocated , fromagener - al perspective , for the importance of connectivity in social networks to enhance one ' s ability to mobilize resources that others possess , includ - ing information . Following this idea , a network - based research collabo - ration , in which three or more actors ( i . e . , individuals or groups of individuals ) pursue a common research goal and take collective actions to achieve the goal by sharing and producing skills , expertise , experi - ence , information , or data in collaborative ways , may be more effective inharnessingcollectiveknowledgethanthoseinasingledyadicrelation or in sets of separate and independent dyadic relations . If not all of the actors possess identical sets of knowledge , individual actors in a re - search group will have a better chance of gaining access to diverse and abundant knowledge resources than in a dyadic relation . The more members with diverse specialized knowledge that join the research group , themorelikelythemembersaretotakeadvantageofrichknowl - edge . Moreover , when a knowledge resource is unavailable , the re - search group can help the members ﬁ nd alternative solutions within or outside the group through network connections . This scenario may best apply to professional networks among researchers who have spe - cialized knowledge but share some common ground ( e . g . , Nerkar & Paruchuri , 2005 ) . Beyondtheresourcesmobilizedthroughsocialconnections , thecon - nectivity and dependency among members in a network - based re - search group can create conditions that engender their solidarity and commitment to collective goals . Networks whose members are closely connected to one another can cultivate the aspects of social relations that facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration , such as trust , norms , and social sanctions based on expectations and obligations , known as bonding social capital ( Coleman , 1988 ; Putnam , 2000 ) . Bond - ing social capital regulates members ' self - interested behavior and , ac - cordingly , leads them to collectively achieve goals and interests in the context of knowledge sharing and collaboration ( Abrams , Cross , Lesser , & Levin , 2003 ) . This outcome is partly because actors in well - connected , closed networks can monitor each other ' s behavior and share information with other members easily ( Coleman , 1988 ) . In this process , the members build their reputations as good or bad collabora - tors , and their reputations can heavily affect their future relationships with the same or different group members . Therefore , unless the mem - bers consider the research partnership as a one - time game or believe that their reputationwill not spreadbeyondthegroup , the researchcol - laboration can avoid a classic prisoner ' s dilemma . Therefore , the trans - parency of the collaboration could reduce the likelihood that individual members will act in self - interested ways and sabotage the cooperative nature of the group . 2 . 2 . Multiplexity and coevolution in research collaboration networks If research collaboration in networks is bene ﬁ cial for scienti ﬁ c knowledge creation , an important question is how research collabora - tions emerge and evolve into integrated and productive networks . In particular , thesocialdynamicsofresearchgroups , asatypeofsocialnet - work in which three or more researchers voluntarily participate , should be elucidated . One possible approach is suggested by studies of the multiplexity of social relations , which means “ the overlap of roles , ex - changes , and af ﬁ liation ” ( Verbrugge , 1979 , p . 1286 ) , and the coevolu - tion of those multiple relations . Sociologists such as Burt and Schøtt ( 1985 ) ; Feld ( 1981 ) , and Lorrain and White ( 1971 ) , have pointed out the multifaceted nature of social networks . Human relations , even among a ﬁ xed set of actors , can be described by those inside the relationship and others outside it in diverse ways ; some relations are described by their roles to one another as friends , mentors , collaborators , or competi - tors or by their behaviors as speakers and listeners or resource providers and receivers . For example , individuals working on a digital government project together are connected to one another as co - workers . If the members publish scholarly work together , they will become coauthors , adding one more layer onto the existing relation among them . In networks across organizational boundaries , members from the same organization share an organizational membership with each other , while those from different organiza - tions do not . Therefore , if a researcher measures and maps all these layers of relations in a research collaboration network , she will be able to draw multiple maps , displaying the diverse structural patterns of connections among the same set of actors . Layers of social relations are intertwined ( Burt & Schøtt , 1985 ; Feld , 1981 ; Lorrain & White , 1971 ) . For any relational choices , including choosing research partners , all layers of relations among the actors could become social contexts in which the choices are made . It is not un - commonto observethat onetype of relationamongmembers frequent - ly affects the formation , maintenance , and dissolution of other types of relationswithin a group . Researchcollaboration networksare noexcep - tion . Oneobviousmultiplexity , whichrefers to thecoexistence of two or more relational contexts in a network , is the association between com - munication and research collaboration . Laudel ( 2001 ) noted that face - to - face communication is essential in the initiation of scienti ﬁ c collabo - ration . Kraut et al . ( 1990 ) did not directly address communication roles in collaborative research , but argued that long distance can be a deal breaker for research collaboration by hindering frequent and quality communication between researchers . Moreover , people often share knowledge and conduct research together with their old friends , col - leagues , supervisors , and students with whom they have a certain level of trust ( Kraut et al . , 1990 ; Melin , 2000 ) . Successful knowledge sharing requires higher investments of time , energy , and sometimes physical resources to succeed , especially when the knowledge shared is tacit , such as skills and know - how , which is dif ﬁ cult to transfer from one side to the other by describing or explaining things in words and symbols without demonstration of practices for a considerable period of time ( Szulanski , 1996 ) . Since the knowledge necessary to conduct scienti ﬁ c research and coauthor papers , such as research ideas , skills , and techniques , tends to be tacit and embedded in individual re - searchers , intimate interactions between the individuals , such as a joint problem - solving experience , are essential for effective sharing of such knowledge ( He et al . , 2009 , p . 307 ) . Sharing physical and ﬁ nancial resources between research collabo - rators represented in coauthorship is another classic example of multiplexity in research collaboration networks . As discussed earlier , easy access to and sharing of research resources is a strong drive of re - search collaboration ( Katz & Martin , 1997 ; Lee & Bozeman , 2005 ; Melin , 2000 ; Smith , 1958 ) . Among the resources , grant - sharing has been emphasized in previous studies as the primary motivation to par - ticipate in group - based research . For example , Heffner ( 1981 ) revealed that the increase in research funding is associated with the increase in the number of coauthors in both the natural and social sciences — in par - ticular , in biological science , chemistry , political science , and psycholo - gy . In his research , this effect was also present when researchers had provided technical support for the project and received an acknowl - edgement in a journal article instead of authorship ( Heffner , 1981 ) . Bozeman and Corley ' s ( 2004 ) study found empirical evidence that the more grants a researcher has , the more collaborators she tends to workwith , whichmakestheresultsofHeffner ' s ( 1981 ) studymorecon - vincing . However , despite studiesdemonstrating the impactof research funding on collaborative research , the process by which grant - sharing leads to the emergence and growth of research groups still remains a black box . 3 M .

If the claims in the previous studies are true in the context of digital government re - search collaboration , both informal ( e . g . , face - to - face communication ) and formal , instrumental ( e . g . , grant - sharing ) relations may account for the formation , maintenance , and dissolution of coauthorship among digital government researchers . In addition , coauthorship , in turn , can be associated with the research productivity of the digital gov - ernment knowledge network . 3 . Data and methods To study the dynamics of the creation and maturation of digital gov - ernment research collaboration in network environments in which threeormoreactorsparticipaterigorously , weselectedthecaseofadig - ital government research group , whose members have diverse disci - plinary , organizational , and national backgrounds . We then collected and analyzed pooled data on relational connections among the mem - bers over a three - year period . To explore the impact of research collab - oration on research productivity in the network , we tracked down 10 years of scholarly and technical publication records for the group members . This section provides a description of the case , the rationale for data selection , and the strategies for data collection and analysis . 3 . 1 . Case description The case selected for this study is the North American Digital Gov - ernment Working Group ( NADGWG ) . Two university professors , one in the United States and one in Mexico , of ﬁ cially launched the working group with researchers from higher education institutions and practi - tioners in non - pro ﬁ t organizations and local governments in early 2007 . That year , 20 members from the three North American countries ― Canada , Mexico , andtheUnitedStates ― andfrom11organi - zations joined NADGWG . Since then , nine more participants , including one German scholar , were recruited during its ﬁ rst two years , while ﬁ ve members , including two of the founding members , withdrew fromtheworkinggroup . Thus , in2009theworkinggroupbecameanet - work of 24 actors , which consisted of 17 researchers ( 14 professors and 3 graduate students ) and 7 practitioners from 4 countries and 15 orga - nizations . The participants had diverse disciplinary backgrounds , such as information science , library science , business , and public administra - tion and policy . The working group developed and worked on two big research projects , dividing its members into two sub - groups . The two researchagendaswere ( 1 ) to enable seamlessintegratedand interoper - able information sharing among governments across national borders and ( 2 ) to develop new data architecture in order to build consumer - oriented product information systems from which consumers can get information about how , where , and by whom imported goods are pro - duced and enter the markets . The of ﬁ cial meetings of the working group continued until 2010 . NADGWGwasformedbasedontheunderstandingthatpublicpolicy problems that governments around the world face had become more complex and that their social and technical capabilities to tackle the problems within and across countries were still very limited . Despite the diversity of the members ' disciplinary backgrounds , the working group had high consensus that existing models of information sharing and collaboration for solving public policy problems were limited in fa - cilitating collaborative efforts among North American governments , both within and across institutional and geographic boundaries . They also agreed that with the aid of technology , particularly through digital government initiatives , governments could build better information - sharing and policy networks to enact cooperative action in the region . Thus , the working group aimed to achieve two main goals : to under - stand both the social and technical challenges and issues of informa - tion - sharing and interoperability of digital government information systems in the national border regions ; and to explore new models of collaboration for digital governance across geographical , jurisdictional , and political boundaries in order to bene ﬁ t the three countries in North America . The research and administrative activities of NADGWG were sup - ported by multiple grants from U . S . and Mexican governments and uni - versities . The primary source of ﬁ nancial resources for research activities was a grant made through the National Science Foundation ' s ( NSF ) Digital Government Research Program in the United States . The $ 75 , 000 grant partially covered the costs of the working group ' s re - search activities between 2007 and 2009 . Three grants awarded from the Mexican government , ranging from $ 3000 to $ 13 , 000 , also support - ed the members ' activities , such as an organizing workshop , conducting ﬁ eldwork , and Mexican members ' travel to Canada and the United States between 2008 and 2009 . 3 . 2 . Rationale for case selection We selected NADGWG for two reasons . First , the working group is a cross - boundary gathering of digital government scholars and practi - tioners . Its members , who primarily came from the three North Ameri - can countries , had interest and professional or research experience in the ﬁ eld of digital government . Although they had a common interest in digital government research , their disciplinary backgrounds and or - ganizational af ﬁ liation were diverse , including both private and public universities , governments , and non - pro ﬁ t research centers . Thus , NADGWGallows us toobservediverseaspectsof digitalgovernment re - search collaboration across disciplinary , organizational , and geographic boundaries . In addition , the accessibility to rich information about the research setting was an important factor affecting case selection . Two of the authors of this paper participated in the working group as founding members , which allowed us to closely observe and later re - view the full history of the working group from its birth to maturation . Despite thewell - known dif ﬁ culty of collectingsocialnetworkdata from thesameset of actors longitudinally for severalyears , theirmembership in the group granted the authors with the privilege to collect data from the members in a stable and systematic manner . 3 . 3 . Data collection and analysis For this exploratory study , three different types of data were collect - ed : archival data , cross - sectional data , and social network data . In par - ticular , archival data used to study the formation of NADGWG were provided by the Center for Technology in Government at the University at Albany , State University of New York . The archival data include re - search and grant proposals , meeting records , project reports , and the curricula vitae ( CV ) of the members . We relied on these qualitative data primarily to understand the emergence of the working group . To studytheevolution and coevolution of multiplex relations among the group members , we administered a survey questionnaire to the group members every year from 2007 to 2009 . In the surveys , respon - dents were asked to provide information about three different types of relations within the working group : face - to - face communication , grant - sharing , and coauthorship . We selected the three focal relations based on theoretical foundations , as discussed in the prior section of this article . In the study , face - to - face communication was operational - ized as when two individuals get acquainted and interact with each other ; to measure it , we asked respondents to check their partners ' names on the roster , corresponding to survey questions about “ who they know personally and interact with face to face . ” We operational - ized grant - sharing as working on the same research project supported by a research grant , and asked respondents to identify “ with whom they have worked in a funded research project together . ” Coauthorship wasde ﬁ ned asthepartnership betweentwoor more individuals topro - duce both scholarly and professional work together , and we asked re - spondents to identify “ with whom they have produced research 4 M .

The ﬁ rst survey was conducted in May of 2007 , the second survey in November of 2008 , and the third survey in December of 2009 . Since the working group continuously grew during the period from 2007 to 2009 , the number of members who received the survey each year varied from 20 to 24 . For data analysis , however , we ﬁ xed our research sample to the 18 members who had joined the working group by May of 2007 and maintained their membership by December of 2009 . This allows us to investigate how the network con - nectivity among a ﬁ xed set of individuals grew over time and how the multiplexity of social relations among them came into play in this pro - cess . The three surveys produced 18 usable responses in 2007 , 12 in 2008 , and 11 in 2009 , resulting in the ﬁ nal response rates of 100 % , 67 % , and 61 % respectively . Using the survey data , we produced binary sociomatrices to analyze the patterns of relations among the group members based on their re - sponses to the survey questions . We did not require that ties be ac - knowledged by both members in dyads , since the words used in the survey questionnaire to measure the three relations , such as “ know and interact , ” “ worked in a funded researchproject together , ” and “ pro - duced research products together , ” are not directional . Thus , if at least one in a pair of respondents indicated that the other actor was her or his counterpart to the network survey item ( s ) for each type of relation - ship , a 1 was entered into the matrix , otherwise a 0 . By doing so , we were able to minimize the loss of information caused by non - responses , reducing missing data . 1 Since NADGWG is a cross - boundary gathering of digital government scholars and practitioners , we controlled for the similarity in their disci - plinary background , organization , and country for further data analysis on the coevolution of multiplex relations . In this study we de ﬁ ne “ disci - plinary background ” as the name of the discipline in which participants earned their highest degree , while “ organization ” is the name of the or - ganization in which each participant is af ﬁ liated at the time when the survey was conducted . The variable “ country ” refers to the home coun - try of the participant ' s organization . The raw data for the control vari - ables were collected from the CV of the members and coded 1 or 0 to represent similarity or dissimilarity , respectively , in each characteristic between the members . The CV were also used to investigate how re - search collaboration outcomes among the members have changed over time , particularly before and after the working group began . We counted the number of conference proceedings , journal articles , books , book chapters , and professional reports coauthored by the members every ﬁ veyears from2003to2012 . Sinceittakesatleastseveralmonths to produce research products once a project is initiated , we considered papers published in 2007 to be outcomes of prior research projects con - ducted before the working group was formed . Using the CV , we veri ﬁ ed the accuracy of respondents ' memories of grant - sharing and coauthoring activities . To analyze the qualitative and quantitative data , we used four methods : archivalanalysis , descriptivesocialnetworkanalysis , network visualization , and stochastic social network analysis . In particular , we utilized multiple regression quadratic assignment procedures ( MRQAP ) to explore the interrelationships among the three focal rela - tions longitudinally . MRQAP is the extension of quadratic assignment procedure ( QAP ) tests to multiple regressions . Like conventional multiple regressions , the QAP tests examine the linear dependence be - tween two relational variables , and the test results provide the associa - tion coef ﬁ cient between a dependent variable and an explanatory variableand p - valueassociatedwiththebeta . However , unlikelinearre - gression models , as nonparametric permutation tests for bivariate models , QAP tests the structural similarity between two variables in square matrices ( i . e . , two network matrices ) by randomly permuting one of the matrices and calculating the probability that the coef ﬁ cient value can be observed by random chance . They do not assume input data to be normally distributed or homogeneity of variance . Rather , as - suming interdependences of the nodes ( i . e . , actors ) , QAP models allow researchers to investigate the likelihood of a relation between the nodes given the existence of another relation between them . In MRQAP tests , models include two or more independent variables and control variables as well . We employed the Double Semi - Partialling ap - proach proposed by Dekker , Krackhardt , and Snijders ( 2007 ) due to the high correlations among the network matrices ( see Table 3 ) . To visual - ize and analyze social network data , we used UCINET 6 ( Version 6 . 544 ) . MRQAP unstandardized beta coef ﬁ cients were generated with 2000 random permutations , and all tests are one - tailed . We considered 2007 as time 0 , 2008 as time 1 , and 2009 as time 2 in our MRQAP models . 4 . Results 4 . 1 . Demographic information of participants The 18 actors included in the data analysis have the following pro - ﬁ le , as shown in Table 1 . About78 % ( 77 . 78 % ) of the actors are university researchers , while 11 . 11 % are government and nonpro ﬁ t practitioners . More than half of the members ( 55 . 56 % ) are af ﬁ liated with U . S . organi - zations and 22 . 22 % ( 4 actors each ) come from organizations in Canada and Mexico . 2 The majority of the members ( 66 . 67 % ) hold a PhD , while sixmembers ( 33 . 33 % ) haveamaster ' sdegree . Themembers ' education - al backgrounds are diverse , but many of them earned their highest de - gree in information science , including informatics or information systems ( 38 . 89 % ) or public administration and policy ( 27 . 78 % ) . The de - mographic characteristics clearly show that NADGWG is an interdisci - plinary , inter - organizational , and transnational research group . 4 . 2 . The emergence of NADGWG This cross - boundary working group started with a funded research proposalforcreatingintergovernmentalandinter - organizationaldigital government initiatives among the three North American countries through support from the NSF Digital Government Research Program . The grant package required a competitively selected group to work to - gether over three years on a topic or problem of their choice . The group was also required to have U . S . and non - U . S . co - chairs , include se - nior and junior scholars , hold periodic face - to - face meetings , and give public reports of their progress . Through the funding program , NSF only provided travel support for participants af ﬁ liated with U . S . institu - tions in the amount of $ 75 , 000 , which excluded salaries or research costs . The two co - founders of NADGWG , one at the University at Albany , State University of New York in the United States and the other at Universidad de las Americas Puebla in Mexico , were close colleagues who had worked on multiple digital government research projects for several years at the same institution . Once the proposal was accepted , they recruited the initial group members by inviting 13 digital govern - ment scholars to the working group early in 2007 . The invitees were also colleagues or friends with whom the two co - founders and a few 1 Symmetrizingmatricesismethodologicallyimportant , sincesocialnetworkanalysisis sensitive to missing data ( see Burt , 1987 ) .

Once they established the ﬁ rst list of group members , a virtual meeting was called in February of 2007 to introduce the group members to each other . Out of the 15 members , including the two founders , 13 members participated in the meeting and at that time 4 of them were selected to serve as the management team for the group . After that , their commu - nication to plan future meetings and research projects took place on a weekly basis , either by virtual means or in person . The ﬁ rst face - to - facemeetingwasheldinPhiladelphia , PennsylvaniaintheUnitedStates in May of 2007 . The main agenda of the ﬁ rst meeting was to build com - mon goals and specify the plans and strategies to achieve the goals to - gether . All 15 members participated in this on - site meeting . Five more individuals joined the group right after the ﬁ rst meeting and thus the founding group included 20 members . 4 . 3 . The evolution of NADGWG 4 . 3 . 1 . Network growth The network indices in Table 2 empirically demonstrate the increas - ing connectivity among the members in the three focal relations be - tween 2007 and 2009 . In 2007 , out of 153 possible ties among the 18 actors in the three undirected networks , about 40 % were realized in face - to - facecommunication , 10 % ingrant - sharing , and 15 % incoauthor - ship networks ; the network densities respectively increased by about 80 % , 30 % , and 33 % in 2009 . The increases in mean degree , which refers to the average number of network ties that each actor in a network has , also support this ﬁ nding . In particular , the actors had in - person conversations with about 6 of the members on average in 2007 and about 13 in 2009 . The mean degrees of the grant - sharing and coauthor - ship networks tripled in 2009 . Fig . 1 is the visual representation of net - work growth . The growth of the grant - sharing and coauthorship networks among the members of NADGWG are partly attributed to activities of some key participants . Whereas centralization , which refers to the ratio of the actual sum of distance to the possible sum of maximum distance be - tween actors in a network , decreased from 0 . 434 to 0 . 228 in the face - to - face communication network , it increased from 0 . 279 to 0 . 449 in the grant - sharing network and from 0 . 301 to 0 . 426 in the coauthorship network . This means that the formation of research grant - sharing and coauthorship relations among members in the working group had be - come more dependent on a few popular and active actors over time , while interpersonal communications had become less dependent on those central actors . The increasing gap between maximum and mini - mum degrees of the grant - sharing network from 6 to 12 and of the co - authorship network from 7 to 12 between 2007 and 2009 is consistent with this ﬁ nding . 4 . 3 . 2 . Knowledge coproduction in the network Compared to the prior ﬁ ve years ( 2003 through 2007 ) , the number of scholarly and professional publications coauthored by the members considerably increased during the next ﬁ ve years after the ﬁ rst meeting of theworkinggroup , as shown inFig . 2 . This result suggeststhat theca - pacity of the group members to collaborate in research and create knowledge together improved over time as the network became more integrated and mature . However , it should be noted that the growth rate of journal articles is lower than those of conference proceedings , book chapters , and professional reports . This difference in growth may be because it takes a longer time to publish papers in peer - reviewed journals than to publish the other three types of manuscripts and that acceptancerates forjournals aregenerallylowerthanthoseforacadem - ic conferences and book chapters . 4 . 4 . The multiplexity and coevolution in NADGWG TheQAP correlation matrix in Table3 demonstratesthat theface - to - face communication , grant - sharing , and coauthorship networks are intertwined with one another , rather than separate and independent . The MRQAP models in Table 4 show the associations of coauthorship with face - to - face communication , grant - sharing , and prior coauthoring experience between the members of NADGWG , considering a sequence of time steps from 2007 to 2009 . Only face - to - face communication ( β = 0 . 182 , p b 0 . 05 ) and coauthorship ( β = 0 . 534 , p b 0 . 05 ) between pairs of the group members at time 0 have statistically signi ﬁ cant asso - ciations with coauthorship at time 1 , but not at time 2 . Ties in the face - to - face communication network at time 1 ( β = 0 . 084 , p N 0 . 05 ) are not signi ﬁ cantly associated with ties in the coauthorship network at time 2 , while ties in the coauthorship network at time 1 ( β = 0 . 728 , p b 0 . 05 ) reliablypredictthesametypeofties attime2 . Theseresults suggestthat interpersonal communication may contribute to the growth of research collaboration during the ﬁ rst phase of network formation and expan - sion , but this effect may disappear once the members get to know each other and their interpersonal connections stabilize . In addition , the coef ﬁ cients of coauthorship networks imply that the research col - laboration experience that members had with particular partners may affect their choice of research partners in the future by following a prin - ciple similar to a Markov Chain . In other words , the probability of two members coauthoring a paper may depend greatly on the previous co - authorship state between them in a sequence of possible events . Meanwhile , connectivity among the members in the grant - sharing network at time 0 ( β = 0 . 246 , p b 0 . 05 ) has a positive and signi ﬁ cant effect on predicting connectivity in the coauthorship network at time 2 , however , not at time 1 . Similarly , the coef ﬁ cient of grant - sharing at time 1 is positive , but not statistically signi ﬁ cant at the 5 % level . These results suggest that grant - sharing may be a key motivator of research collaboration among digital government researchers and practitioners , but that there may be time lags between starting collaborative projects by sharing grants and actually producing tangible results from the re - search collaboration ( i . e . , publications ) . In order to discern the amount of variance explained by the similar - ity in disciplinary , organizational , and country af ﬁ liation between the Table 2 Summary of network properties ( N = 18 ) .

The coef ﬁ cients in models 1 , 2 , and 5 indi - cate that the similarity in organizational af ﬁ liation between members is positively and signi ﬁ cantly associated with the formation and mainte - nance of coauthorship between the members at time 0 ( β = 0 . 308 , p b 0 . 05 ) and time 1 ( β = 0 . 267 , p b 0 . 05 ) , but negatively and signi ﬁ - cantly associated at time 2 ( β = − 0 . 290 , p b 0 . 05 ) . On the other hand , the similarity in country is positively and signi ﬁ cantly associated with coauthorship at time 2 at the 5 % level in all the three models , but this association is not held at both time 0 and time 1 . The similarity in disciplinary background is not signi ﬁ cantly related to ties in the coau - thorship network at all time periods at the 5 % level . These results dem - onstrate that research collaboration among the group members with different disciplinary backgrounds had been prevalent even before the working group was formed . In the early stages of the working group , the members tended to coauthor publications with colleagues in the same organization ; after about two and a half years , their efforts to es - tablish inter - organizational research collaboration came to fruition and publications tended to be coauthored by members from different organizations . Despite the transnational group composition , however , the tendency of members to publish papers with others from the same country became stronger over time .

Five propositions for future research Based on the ﬁ ndings of the archival research , conventional statis - tics , and socialnetworkanalyses , we developed ﬁ ve empirically testable propositions that can guide future research into the mechanisms of net - work - based , cross - boundary digital governmentresearchcollaboration . We believe that the propositions are also applicable to the formation , maintenance , and maturation of collaborative research across disciplin - ary , organizational , and geographical boundaries broadly in science . Proposition 1 . : Shared research interestswill be a necessary condition for the emergence or maturation of researchcollaboration . Common re - searchinterests amongmembers canprovide acommon groundforcol - laboration among individuals who have different backgrounds in cross - boundary research groups . Research collaboration is cooperative work between and among researchers who may have heterogeneous aca - demic , socio - demographic , and technical backgrounds within and across boundaries to resolve shared problems . Previous studies such as Pohl ( 2005 ) and Subramanyam ( 1983 ) found that sharing common interests among researchers , in particular arriving at a consensus on what to study and how to study it , is essential for collaboration across organizational and disciplinary boundaries . In particular , Pohl ( 2005 ) empirically addressed that dif ﬁ culty within interdisciplinary collabora - tion arises mostly from cultural and experiential , rather than technical , differences among researchers . Our ﬁ ndings are consistent with these ﬁ ndings . In NADGWG , more than 7 disciplines , 4 countries , 3 languages , and 15 organizations were represented . Despite the high heterogeneity of group members , they shared a common interest and professional or research experience in the ﬁ eld of digital government . Moreover , in the ﬁ rst face - to - face meeting , two speci ﬁ c research topics emerged and the group members were divided into two sub - groups to plan two research projects that were particularly of interest to them . Proposition 2 . : Socialnetworks , associalcapital , will affectpartner se - lection for research collaboration .

When the co - founders of NADGWG made a list of individuals to invite , they considered their for - mer and current colleagues as their potential research partners . More - over , the members ' network connections outside the working group allowed them to identify new potential group members in the early stages of the NADGWG ' s growth and maturation , and these new mem - bers contributed to sharingknowledge and producingresearch publica - tions . Our longitudinal socialnetworkanalysis of coauthorship data also revealed that current coauthorship ties can predict coauthorship ties in the following year . These results show that researchers ' existing ties with other researchers and practitioners within and outside a group are valuable social capital ― the actual and potential sources of knowl - edge sharing and research collaboration . Proposition 3 . : Socialization through face - to - face communication among group members will be key to maturation of research collabora - tion . TheadvanceinICTsisbene ﬁ cial , butitsimpactonthisprocessislim - ited . Socialization can be crucial for successful research collaboration in three ways . First , it can help members come to a mutual understanding of a research topic and its importance to build shared goals . Based on this common ground , the members come together to pursue their collec - tive goals , investing their energy , time , and other resources . In the ﬁ rst face - to - face meeting , NADGWG members invested most of their time in building common goals and creating clear research agendas for the next few years . This roadmap helped the group focus their resources on the two projects and ultimately achieve their goals . Second , trust built during group socialization can facilitate effective knowledge sharing and in turn increase research productivity via jointly coauthored publications . Previ - ous studies have empirically proven that trust — both between individuals and across the group of individuals — is critical to success in knowledge sharing , particularly when the knowledge to be shared is tacit and em - bedded in individuals or in the context in which the individuals reside ( Argote , McEvily , & Reagans , 2003 ; Davenport & Prusak , 1998 ) . Socializa - tion among members is key to mitigating con ﬂ icts and nurturing trust for knowledge sharing ( Von Krogh , Ichijo , & Nonaka , 2000 ) . The results of this study show that in the early stages of the research collaboration , theexpansionoftheface - to - facecommunicationnetworkispositivelyas - sociated with the coauthorship network , which also supports the impor - tance of socialization . Finally , it is obvious that the development of ICTs has changed the landscape of digital government research , not only by enhancing the depth and breadth of research topics , but also by enabling research col - laboration across institutional and geographical boundaries . However , without face - to - face communication and interaction , such impact may be limited . Geographic distance generally increases travel costs , which may make it harder for members in different countries to build enough interpersonal trust with each other to share ﬁ nancial resources and commit to a research project that requires considerable time and effort . CummingsandKiesler ( 2005 ) havepointedoutthatdespiteadvancesin technology , scienti ﬁ c research collaboration across geographic , organi - zational , and disciplinary boundaries is still dif ﬁ cult due to relational distance . In the case of NADGWG , although they had several video tele - conferences and phone meetings between the face - to - face meetings , most of the important group - wide issues ( such as future grant applica - tions ) were discussed and decided upon during the three face - to - face meetings . Thus , ICTs absent interpersonal socialization may only have a limited capacity to increase the productivity of network - based , cross - boundary research collaboration — especially for a large research team that requires greater coordination . Proposition 4 . : Economic motives will be an important driving force of successful research collaboration . It is not hard to ﬁ nd examples of re - search projects that cannot begin or are discontinued due to a shortage of ﬁ nancial and physical resources . On the other hand , often researchers frommultipleorganizationsandcountriesareabletoworktogethertose - cure a large research grant and then publish papers produced with the support of that grant ( Katz & Martin , 1997 ; Lee & Bozeman , 2005 ; Melin , 2000 ; Smith , 1958 ) . The co - founders of NADGWG started recruiting members and conducting research with them after the NSF grant was approved . In addition to the U . S . grant , three grants from the Mexican NSF ( Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia ) contributed to the stabilization of research collaboration activities among the group members , mostly by supporting their travels , face - to - face meetings , and ﬁ eld study expenses . The strong association between ties in the grant - sharing network in the founding year of NADGWG and in the coauthor - ship network at year two demonstrate the critical role of ﬁ nancial re - sources in the growth of the working group into a productive research collaboration network . Proposition 5 . : Public research policies can become both facilitators and barriers to research collaboration . Although there are controversies over the effect of government research policies , particularly research funding policies on shaping scienti ﬁ c research ( see Melin ‚ 2000 ) , it is undeniable that the primary customer for digital government research is governments , and that government research grants are the largest source of scienti ﬁ c research knowledge in this ﬁ eld . In the case of NADGWG , researchfundingfromU . S . andMexicangovernmentsplayed asigni ﬁ cantroleinlaunchingandfosteringthecross - boundaryresearch collaboration group in its early stage . Before the NSF funding was granted , the working group was just a good idea . All the important pro - cesses for the formation and evolution of the working group , from the invitation of its initial members to publishing research products , were conducted when preparing the grant proposal or after the project grant was in place . Moreover , the requirements of the grant , such as having U . S . and non - U . S . co - chairs , including senior and junior scholars , holding periodic face - to - face meetings , and publishing public reports of their progress , greatly affected not only the structure , but also the activ - itiesof theworking group . However , theNSF grant package did not sup - port research activities , including travel , for non - U . S . participants . With the exception of two graduate students af ﬁ liated with a U . S . university , members who left the working group between the second and third face - to - face meetings were all non - U . S . citizens who were af ﬁ liated in foreign governments or research institutions . The exact reasons why they departed the group were not clear , but the lack of ﬁ nancial re - sources for non - U . S . participants might have affected their decision to leave . It seems clear that more programs that encourage international collaborations could partially solve the ﬁ nancial barriers to participation . 6 . Conclusion Using a mixed - method approach , we explored how an interdisci - plinary , inter - organizational , and transnational digital government re - search team was formed and evolved into an integrated and productive network . The illustration of all the stages , from emergence to full integration of NADGWG , demonstrates that network - based , cross - boundary digital government research collaboration is dynamic , rather than static . The study also contributes to uncovering the “ black box ” of relational development in research collaboration networks by revealing the complex interrelations among face - to - face communica - tion , grant - sharing , and coauthorship among group members . We havealsoprovided ﬁ vepropositionsforfutureapplicationandempirical testing , which are based on prior theory , empirical studies , and our own ﬁ ndings presented here . However , thestudyisnotfreefromlimitations . First , thisstudyrelies on data collected from a single case , and the social network data 9 M . Ku et al . / Government Information Quarterly xxx ( 2016 ) xxx – xxx Please cite this article as : Ku , M . , et al . , The emergence and evolution of cross - boundary research collaborations : An explanatory study of social dynamics in a digital govern . . . , Government Information Quarterly ( 2016 ) , http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . giq . 2016 . 07 . 005 collected between 2007 and 2009 are somewhat outdated . Diverse forms of research collaboration could emerge among three or more dig - ital government researchers and practitioners across boundaries , and thedynamicsintheevolutionofcollaborativegroupsmightnotbeiden - tical across contexts . In addition , collaborative behaviors of digital gov - ernment researchers and practitioners might be affected by the fast - changing research environments , including the development of new ICTs ; if so , the explanatory power of the data might be weaker than we think . The propositions developed in the study should be tested in diverse settings with more recent data . Second , the survey items of the three networks of interest mea - sure cumulative relations , and the analyses based on data collected through the self - report surveys are not completely free from memo - ry bias . To measure grant - sharing among the members in each year , we asked respondents to recall with whom they have worked in a funded research project together . This type of question tends to lead people to report their life - long experience , rather than their experience during a certain period of time . Thus , grant - sharing networks at time 0 and time 1 account partially for the networks at time 1 and time 2 respectively . Moreover , although we were able to verify respondents ' answers to the survey questions about coau - thorship and grant - sharing relations as accurate as possible based on their CV , this study is not free from the possibility that respon - dents mistakenly reported their face - to - face communication rela - tions . We suggest future studies examine the coevolution of social networking , resource sharing , and research collaboration by capturing snapshots of the networks at different intervals and analyzing the evolutionary relationships among them . Finally , the current study is missing some important factors that can affect interactions and communications for research collaboration at an individual level : demographic characteristics such as age , gender , eth - nicity , ﬁ rst language , and individual differences in propensity toward research collaboration . Previous studies on research collaboration and coauthorship have suggested that socio - demographic and cognitive characteristics of researchers can be associated with their knowledge sharing and coproduction with others ( e . g . , Kyvik & Teigen , 1996 ; Trier & Molka - Danielsen , 2013 ; Van Rijnsoever & Hessels , 2011 ) . Thus , the absence of this data might limit the explanatory power of the cur - rent study for interpersonal knowledge sharing and research collabora - tion . Finally , the current study provides only limited explanation for the initial coauthorship and grant - sharing relations that members had be - fore joining the working group . These limitations should also be ad - dressed and explained by future research . References Abrams , L . C . , Cross , R . , Lesser , E . , & Levin , D . Z . ( 2003 ) .
