But the authors did not discuss the possibility of using saliva sampling . Nasopharyngeal ( NP ) swabs are the preferred collection vehicles in France and many other countries and several studies have indicated that this method is more sensitive than sampling other sites [ 2 – 4 ] . Saliva sampling is less invasive for patients , less hazardous for health care workers , requires fewer experimented staff and is less expensive for mass testing . However , little is known about any differences in the sensitivities of saliva and NP sampling or how any differences vary with presence or absence of clinical symptoms . We compared the sensitivities of saliva and NP swab samples for detecting SARS - CoV2 in hospitalized and ambulatory patients . Saliva was collected by asking patients to salivate , swill the saliva around their mouth for at least 30 s and then spit into a sterile container . Samples were assayed by real - time RT - PCR on a Panther Fusion™ module ( Hologic ® ) [ 5 ] . The target was the SARS - CoV - 2 RNA - dependent poly - merase gene ( IP2 , IP4 , Institut Pasteur , Paris , France ) . We assayed saliva and NP swab samples , collected on the same day , from 123 in - dividuals ( median age : 43 years , male / female ratio : 49 / 74 ) . The 123 individuals with paired samples included 44 ( 35 . 8 % ) with at least one positive specimen . Of these , 17 were asymptomatic and 27 were symptomatic , 9 of whom were hospitalized . The 44 infected in - dividuals comprised 34 ( 77 . 3 % ) with both samples positive , 3 ( 6 . 8 % ) with only positive saliva , and 7 ( 15 . 9 % ) with only positive NP swabs ( Table 1 ) . Thus the saliva samples detected 37 / 44 ( 82 . 2 % ) patients , while the NP swabs detected 41 / 44 ( 93 . 2 % ) patients ( p = 0 . 34 ) . The sensitivity of saliva samples was 88 . 2 % ( 15 / 17 ) for asymptomatic carriers , 94 . 7 % ( 18 / 19 ) for symptomatic patients tested early ( < 1 week ) after symptom onset , and 50 % ( 4 / 8 ) for symptomatic patients with saliva collected late after symptom onset ( Table 1 ) . The paired samples had median IP4 Ct values , reflecting virus load , of 29 . 5 ( IQR 27 . 6 – 33 . 3 ) for saliva samples and 24 . 9 ( IQR 21 . 9 – 30 . 9 ) for NP swabs ( p < 0 . 01 ) . The median IP4 Ct value for the NP swabs from patients with negative saliva tests ( 35 , IQR 26 . 3 – 37 . 1 ) was higher than those with positive saliva test ( 24 . 9 , IQR 21 . 9 – 30 . 9 ; p = 0 . 01 ) . The Ct values for the IP2 target gave similar results . Several reports have suggested using saliva samples to detect SARS - CoV - 2 in symptomatic patients [ 6 – 13 ] but few data are available on their use for testing asymptomatic carriers [ 14 ] . Our results show that saliva samples provide relevant , reliable data , especially for asympto - matic individuals and symptomatic patients detected early , although the virus loads in saliva are lower than in NP swabs . The rare dis - crepancies between the saliva and NP samples occurred in low virus load patients , who were , perhaps , not very contagious . Suitably su - pervised saliva collection is undoubtedly simpler and more comfortable than using NP swabs . It could therefore improve workflow , lower cost , and reduce the risk of infection for healthcare professionals . Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare no conflict of interest .
