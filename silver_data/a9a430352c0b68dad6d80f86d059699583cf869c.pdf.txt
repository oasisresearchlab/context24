This study applied a PLS - SEM partial least square structural equation modeling technique to test the hypotheses on a sample of 345 police personnel of Pakistan . The results of this study indicate a positive and strong association between the despotic leadership and counterproductive work behavior . The findings show a positive and significant influence of despotic leadership on emotional exhaustion . Moreover , the results show an important and significant influence of the despotic leadership and counterproductive work behavior when the mediation role of emotional exhaustion is included . Furthermore , this study found an insignificant moderating influence of organizational cynicism in the relationship between despotic leadership and emotional exhaustion . Implications and limitations are also discussed in this article . Keywords Despotic leadership · Counterproductive work behavior · Emotional exhaustion · Organizational cynicism · Police department · Pakistan Introduction Police officers are known as having an enormously stress - ful occupation that includes frequent exposures to a subset of potentially psychologically traumatic occasions ( Miller et al . 2020 ) . Law enforcement agencies are considered as the supreme departments of every country which provide protection , care , and welfare to the people . The role of police personnel in the protection of people is the most important after the other law enforcement agencies such as military and other intelligence agencies . According to Sherwood et al . ( 2019 ) , low - rank police personnel left jobs and demo - tivated every year due to despotic behavior of their high - rank police officers . Prior researchers have highlighted the importance of the dark side of leadership by illuminating destructive features of leadership that can have a negative influence on turnover , deviant work behavior , emotional exhaustion , employee job dissatisfaction , and job stress ( Naseer et al . 2016b ; Nauman et al . 2018 ) . These destructive behaviors such as abusive supervision , despotic leadership , and destructive leadership have been investigated by previ - ous researchers ( Woestman and Wasonga 2015 ; Schyns and Schilling 2013 ; Aravena 2019 ) . Despotic leadership includes prominent types of the dark side of leadership , and several organizations are spending billions of dollars on counter - productive work behaviors , but there is lack of research that has been conducted on this area in the field of manage - ment and psychology studies ( Liu et al . 2020a ; Naseer et al . * Majid Murad majidmurad1 @ gmail . com Wang Jiatong wjt521andy @ hotmail . com Fakhar Shahzad fshahzad51 @ yahoo . com Nausheen Syed nausheen . dr @ gmail . com 1 School of Management , Jiangsu University , Zhenjiang , China 2 College of International Business , Zhejiang Yuexiu University of Foreign Languages , Shaoxing , China 3 Department of Business Administration , ILMA University , Karachi , Pakistan 4 Department of Business Administration , Government College Women University , Faisalabad , Pakistan / Published online : 14 July 2021 Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology ( 2021 ) 36 : 603 – 615 1 3 2020 ) . Despotic leadership refers to a leader’s tendency to participate in authoritarian and dominant behavior to gain self - interest , self - motivation , and exploitation of their sub - ordinates ( De Hoogh and Den Hartog 2008 ) . Counterproductive work behavior explains deliberate actions of employees that are associated with negative and harmful behaviors such as fraud , tardiness , absenteeism , physical , and verbal violence to both the employee’s and the organizations ( Ying and Cohen 2018 ) . As indicated by Li et al . ( 2020 ) , counterproductive work behaviors have differ - ent types of nature : interpersonal , organizational , and super - visory . Interpersonal behavior states the negative and harm - ful behavior of an individual that influences on coworkers ( Ho 2012 ) ; organizational behavior refers to the voluntary actions that negatively impact on the policies and structure of the organizations ( Yan et al . 2020 ) ; supervisory behavior discusses the negative and harmful behavior that affects the supervision of employees in the organization ( Lebrón et al . 2018 ) . Furthermore , research on despotic leadership , emotional exhaustion , and organizational cynicism is vague ( Nauman et al . 2018 ) . Emotional exhaustion is a chronic state of physi - cal and emotional depletion that results from an unneces - sary job , personal demands , and continuous job stress in the organization ( Chen et al . 2019 ) . Organizational cynicism refers to an employee’s feeling of dissatisfaction toward the organization ( Sak 2018 ) . Therefore , the relationship between despotic leadership and counterproductive work behavior is empirically less studied due to its positive , negative , signifi - cant , and insignificant results of prior researchers ( Brender - Ilan and Sheaffer 2019 ; Erkutlu and Chafra 2018b ) . Existing literature suggests that future researchers can take emotional exhaustion as a mediator and organizational cynicism as moderator variables in the relationship between despotic leadership and counterproductive work behavior . This study planned to contribute to the existing litera - ture in several ways . First , this study contributes to fill the research gap regarding the relationship between despotic leadership and counterproductive work behavior . Prior researcher stated that despotic leadership is the most influ - ential factor that positively and negatively affects devi - ance behaviors ( Erkutlu and Chafra 2018b ) . Second , this study adds to the empirical framework of Naseer et al . ( 2016b ) by testing emotional exhaustion as a mediator in the association between despotic leadership and counter - productive work behavior ( Nauman et al . 2018 ) . Third , this study covers the existing gap of organizational cyni - cism as a moderator in the relationship between despotic leadership and emotional exhaustion . Fourth , this study uses affective event theory and conservation of resource theory to investigate the direct effect of despotic leader - ship and the mediating role of emotional exhaustion on the counterproductive work behavior . Finally , this study extends into the police personnel from the police depart - ment of Punjab , Pakistan , because no empirical study is available in the context of despotic leadership , emotional exhaustion , organizational cynicism , and counterproduc - tive work behavior . The rest of the paper categories is as follows : after the introduction , we discuss the theoretical foundation , hypoth - eses development , methodology , results , and discussion , as well as the implication and conclusion of this paper . Theoretical Foundation We used two theories which support our proposed research model : affective event theory ( AET ) and conservation of resource theory ( COR ) . AET suggests that leadership action and environment influence the feelings of employees and help them to perform counterproductive work behavior ( Wang et al . 2020 ) . Moreover , considering the role of this theory , work environment offers the appropriate platform where the actions are performed through affective path ; thus , hassles and uplifts are transformed which resultantly lead to relate positive and negative behaviors ( Tillman et al . 2018 ) . Therefore , it is evident that any feature or action of the envi - ronment within the workplace has a positive and negative implication on emotion and behavior . Affective event theory defines that experience of working condition such as des - potic leadership behavior effects affective states and result - ant behavior ( Cropanzano et al . 2017 ) . Furthermore , based on AET , we discuss that despotic leadership includes actions and events wherein employees are treated dishonestly and unfairly ; thus , such actions may lead to enhance negative and positive affectivity of the despotic leadership . In such a condition interpersonal environment , the despotic leadership feel hurt , anxious , and worried , which ultimately engaged in deviant work behaviors ( Reynolds Kueny et al . 2020 ) . Considering the role of conservation of resource COR theory , we argue that despotic leadership is the foundation of social stress and the loss of leadership support revealed in self - interest behavior in the supervisor and subordinate relationship . COR suggests that employee work behaviors are influenced by anticipated resource advantages and dis - advantages so employees engage in positive work behaviors that can control their existing personal resources and attain maximum performance ( Xia et al . 2019 ) . As noted by De Clercq et al . ( 2020 ) despotic leadership is an authoritarian , unethical , exploitive , and self - serving behavior . Therefore , very collectivist , insecurity , and power - distant culture like Pakistan may lead to emotional exhaustion . Thus , in this context , we contend that despotic leadership is directly asso - ciated with the counterproductive work behavior and indi - rectly related through emotional exhaustion . 604 Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology ( 2021 ) 36 : 603 – 615 1 3 Model and Hypotheses Development Despotic Leadership and Counterproductive Work Behavior Looking into previous literature , despotic leadership and counterproductive work behavior have become the research focus in the field of behavioral management and psychology ( Brender - Ilan and Sheaffer 2019 ; Erkutlu and Chafra 2018b ) . Counterproductive work behavior is defined as voluntary action that violates the organizational norms and values and threatens the well - being of an organization and its members ( Blickle and Schütte 2017 ) . Moreover , despotic leadership is also defined as aggressive behavior toward subordinates and the exploitation that creates fear and stress between subordinates regarding their job position in the organization ( Jabeen and Rahim 2020 ) . The relationship between despotic leadership and counterproductive work behavior is already defined in the prior literature ( Erkutlu and Chafra 2018b ) . The existing study identifies the role of despotic leadership on deviant behavior and found that despotic leadership generates aggressive counterproductive work behavior such as job dissatisfaction , turnover , low commitment , absenteeism , and individual performance ( Brender - Ilan and Sheaffer 2019 ) . Recently , studies focus on the dark side of personality traits and counterproductive work behavior on workplace ( Li et al . 2020 ) among doctor’s performance . The findings indicate that the dark side of personalities has a significant influence on counterproductive work behavior . Prior investigations on despotic leadership and employee behavior examined the employee reciprocity norm , employee well - being ( Nauman et al . 2018 ) , organizational commit - ment , accountability , and psychological contact breach ( Ying and Cohen 2018 ) . The results of these studies sug - gested that individuals adjust their behaviors according to the situation . Usually , individuals adjust their behaviors downward through engaging in counterproductive work behavior which comprises harmful and negative actions that engage regarding their organization or its members ( Naseer et al . 2018 ) . Thus , despotic leadership is found to be positive and significantly correlated with counterproductive work behavior engaged at both organization and employee’s behavior . Consequently , we predicted this hypothesis : H1 : Despotic leadership is positively related to coun - terproductive work behavior . Despotic Leadership and Emotional Exhaustion Scholars have defined the positive relationship between despotic leadership and emotional exhaustion ( Nauman et al . 2018 ; Naseer et al . 2016a ) . According to Dust et al . ( 2018 ) , views on despotic leadership are more toxic , and it is low on morale and ethical behavior , self - evaluation , compassion , personal commitment , and responsibility for one’s action . Prior researchers explained that despotic leadership has qualities like autocratic leadership that are more likely toward controlling and less participation of subordinates in organizational decision - making aspects ( De Clercq et al . 2020 ) . Following the views of existing researchers , despotic leaders exploit and treat unethically their subordinates and followers since they lack ethical norms and values ( Han et al . 2020 ) . This type of lead - ership behavior affects the performance of employees in the organization and misuse the authority to satisfy their personal interests that ultimatley demotivate employees to meet organizational goals ( Braun et al . 2018 ) . The recipro - cal behavior is not directly focused on the despotic lead - ership because antisocial authority is hard to address and select narrow escape by counterproductive work behavior ( Schyns and Schilling 2013 ) . Moreover , studies explained that emotional exhaustion happens when emotional demands exceed an individual’s capability to deal with interpersonal and social interactions at workplace ( Mo and Shi 2017 ) . There is increasing evi - dence in the past research that aggressive leadership leads to negative and harmful results for subordinates , including absenteeism , turnover , anxiety , depression , job dissatis - faction , and deviant behavior ( Brown and Mitchell 2010 ) . Therefore , individuals with the despotic leadership char - acters are more likely to behave carelessly and exploita - tive which ultimately develops stress among subordinates to quit a job as well as resulting in job burnout . Thus , we hypothesized . H2 : Despotic leadership is positively related to emotional exhaustion . Emotional Exhaustion and Counterproductive Work Behavior The effect of emotional exhaustion in a counterproductive workforce has received less attention in the literature ( Bolton et al . 2012 ) . However , in the context of organizational behav - ioral study , emotional exhaustion is the influencing factor that affects the employee’s emotion ( Lebrón et al . 2018 ) . A prior study explains how a challenging and demanding leader could be a reason for an employee to feel annoyed and dissatisfied and how these feelings can ultimately lead to counterproductive work behavior ( Krischer et al . 2010 ) . According to Chen et al . ( 2020 ) , employees who do not get better and optimistic behavior from their leaders may suffer from emotional burden and consequently emotional exhaus - tion . Emotional exhaustion is the type of burnout construct 605 Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology ( 2021 ) 36 : 603 – 615 1 3 and is associated with anxiety ( Banks et al . 2012 ) . Moreover , burnout construct has further dimensions such as deperson - alization and personal achievement . Depersonalization is related to the loss of empathy in relationships and personal achievement associated with the personal assessment of ones rather than negativity and self - doubt concerning their pre - sent , future , and past achievements ( Salvagioni et al . 2017 ) . Furthermore , Cropanzano et al . ( 2003 ) explained that emotional exhaustion is a general sense of feeling emotion - ally overloaded and overextended . Therefore , individuals who are more emotionally exhausted are more inclined to engage in harmful behavior that is deviant toward the organization ( Hunter and Penney 2014 ) . Previous studies stated that emotionally exhausted people show counter - productive work behavior more commonly ( Zhang et al . 2016 ) . If job resources are limited with low quality , then emotional exhaustion can lead to behaviors that are related to the counterproductive work behavior ( Liu et al . 2020b ) . Thus , we assume that employee with a higher level of emo - tional exhaustion affects positively counterproductive work behavior . Hence , we predicted the hypothesis . H3 : Emotional exhaustion is positively related to coun - terproductive work behavior . The Mediating Role of Emotional Exhaustion The relationship between emotional exhaustion , despotic leadership , and counterproductive work behavior is not examined by previous researchers . The prior study examines the positive relationship between despotic leadership and counterproductive work behavior ( Erkutlu and Chafra 2018b ) . " A study conducted by Bolton et al . ( 2012 ) " , emotional exhaustion is the positive and significant predictor to measure counterproductive work behavior . Recently , the study examined the role of despotic leadership with the mediating role of emotional exhaustion to investigate the work - family conflict and life satisfaction among book - selling employees . The findings suggest that emotional exhaustion positively and significantly influence the relationship between despotic leadership and work - family conflict ( Nauman et al . 2018 ) . According to Chen et al . ( 2020 ) , emotional exhaustion is an important factor of burnout and is associated with the depletion of resources . The conservation of resource theory COR is linked to the depletion of resources because considering the role of this theory , we postulate that despotic leadership might lead subordinates to deplete their personal and emotional resources and become exhausted ( Chi et al . 2018 ) . Therefore , emotionally exhausted individuals have little energy left for bearing a negative behavior of their leaders that ultimately leads to counterproductive work behavior . An existing study found that emotional exhaustion is the result of pathetic leadership because it occurs to consume more emotional resources to deal with interpersonal dealings than the normal situations ( Fida et al . 2018 ) . Moreover , we posit that despotic leadership and aggressive and unethical behavior lead to severe effects for the subordinates , e . g . , depression , burnout , and turnover . Thus , it is observed in previous literature despotic leaders have the exploitative type of personalities which creates the stress and depression in subordinates as well as hurts the emotions . Consequently , we hypothesized : H4 : Emotional exhaustion will positively mediate in the relationship between despotic leadership and counterpro - ductive work behavior . Moderating Effect of Organizational Cynicism Organizational cynicism is associated with the depression in employee caused by the faith that the organization is lacking honesty which when becomes related to extreme negative feelings leads to critical decisive behavior ( Grama and Todericiu 2016 ) . Organizational cynicism is containing three dimensions : cognitive cynicism , affective cynicism , and behavioral cynicism . Cognitive cynicism is defined as a loss of trust with their organization . Affective cynicism deals with a negative anger and disgust with their organi - zation . Behavioral cynicism refers to a critical behavior demonstrated toward their organization ( Yang et al . 2020 ) . Researchers believed that individuals are motivated through cynicism and self - interest ( Jiang et al . 2019 ) . Individuals meet many issues due to cynicism as they build harmful and negative emotions concerning organizations such as dissat - isfaction , anger , and depression included by despotic leader - ship and counterproductive behavior ( Durrah et al . 2019 ) . Despotic leadership is a tendency to engage in authoritarian and dominant behavior in order to gain self - interest , self - confidence , and exploitation of their subordinates ( Naseer et al . 2016b ) . Therefore , it is inferred that organizational cynicism and despotic leadership are entangled recogniz - able facts . Furthermore , Erkutlu and Chafra ( 2018b ) stated that des - potic leaders are a source of disregard and dishonor for the employees . This disregarded and dishonor behavior is enough to emotionally release the span of control , and they get their emotional resources exhausted that are problematic to be refilled . In other words , in the deficiency of organizational cynicism , this exhaustion is amplified and drained to accu - mulate stress from work life in the organization ( Nauman et al . 2018 ) . Thus , leaders with a high level of authoritarian behavior are more likely to engage in emotional exhaustion of employees which lead to the decisive behavior in the organi - zation . Therefore , we predicted the hypothesis : 606 Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology ( 2021 ) 36 : 603 – 615 1 3 H5 : Organizational cynicism will positively moderate in the relationship between despotic leadership and emo - tional exhaustion . Methodology Study Context In Pakistan , despotic and authoritative leadership style is highly dominant in the police department ( Saleem et al . 2018 ) . High - rank officers are known to maintain tight control over their low - rank officers by providing them less authority and power . According to De Clercq et al . ( 2018 ) , supervisors’ authoritative behavior with their low - rank officers demoti - vate them to be emotionally exhausted from their duties . In our opinion , examining the influence of despotic leadership among low - rank police officers in Pakistan provided us the most appropriate target population . The conceptual model depicting the relationships and hypothesis is given in Fig . 1 . Sample and Procedure The data was collected using self - administered questionnaires from the low - ranked police officers working at different big cities in the province of Punjab , Pakistan . The target popu - lation of the study was constable , head constable , assistant sub inspector , and sub inspector rank police personnel . Before going to collect data , we approached the police station to get approval for the data collection and ensured them this research was purely conducted for academic purposes and assured the participants of the complete confidentiality of their responses . Moreover , we distributed 400 paper and pencil questionnaires randomly to the police personnel and asked them to fill this questionnaire in free time . In total , 345 questionnaires were received in the survey , a response rate of 86 % . There is no monetary reward given to the participants . Among the valid responses , most of the police personnel were constables ( 35 . 4 % ) , and 33 . 3 % were head constable in the police sta - tions . The highest response rate of the participants was in the range of 18 – 30 years ( 43 . 8 % ) , and the highest education of the respondents was 39 . 4 % intermediate and 34 . 2 % graduation degrees . Also , 33 . 3 % had 2 – 3 years and 6 . 4 % had 4 – 8 years of work experience . Scales In this study , we adopted measurement scales from previous studies that were tested and verified by numerous researchers according to their cultures , countries , and work settings ( Erkutlu and Chafra 2018a ; Li et al . 2020 ) . To assess all the responses of participants , a five - point Likert scale ranging from 1 strongly disagree to 5 strongly agree was used to rate the responses . Despotic Leadership To measure despotic leadership , we used a six - item scale developed by De Hoogh and Den Hartog ( 2008 ) . This scale was used and tested by prior researchers ( Nauman et al . 2018 ; Naseer et al . 2016b ) . A sample item was “my super - visor gives orders . ” Emotional Exhaustion To measure emotional exhaustion , we used nine measure - ment items from the study of Pines and Aronson ( 1988 ) . This measurement scale was tested by previous researchers to measure emotional exhaustion ( Naseer et al . 2016a ; Dust et al . 2018 ) . Therefore , we adapted this scale according to our study setting . A sample item was “I feel emotionally exhausted and I feel that I cannot take it anymore . ” Organizational Cynicism The organizational cynicism scale was adapted from the study by Dean Jr et al . ( 1998 ) . This scale was also used and verified by researchers ( Brandes et al . 1999 ; Jiang et al . 2019 ) . This scale includes twelve items and further divided into three dimensions : cognitive cynicism , affective cyni - cism , and behavioral cynicism . Every dimension has four measurement items . A sample item for cognitive cynicism is “I believe that my organization says one thing and does another . ” A sample item for affective cynicism is “When I think about my organization , I experience tension . ” A sam - ple item for behavioral cynicism is “My organization poli - cies , goals and practices seem to have little in common . ” Counterproductive Work Behavior To assess counterproductive work behavior , we used eight items adapted from the study of Dalal and Carpenter ( 2018 ) . This scale was used and verified by existing researchers ( Ying and Cohen 2018 ; Li et al . 2020 ) . A sample item was “Did not work to the best of my ability . ” Results Data Analysis Technique We applied the partial least squares PLS - SEM technique using the Smart - PLS software version 3 . 0 . The benefit of this software stems from its robustness in testing predictive applications , theory establishment , and explanation ( Hair Jr et al . 2016 ; Cai et al . 2021 ) . This software is used by 607 Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology ( 2021 ) 36 : 603 – 615 1 3 previous researchers to measure the direct , indirect , and moderating effect of relationships in the same path model ( Shahzad et al . 2020 ; Hair et al . 2012 ) . This software is also helping for the analysis of the exploratory nature of studies . Nowadays , this technique is considered as a silver bullet in the field of management science and behavioral research studies ( Sarstedt and Cheah 2019 ; Murad et al . 2021 ) . Common Method Bias To check the issue of common method bias , we applied ( Harman 1967 ) single - factor test . According to Harman’s methodology , a common method exists in the data when we perform factor analysis , and all the factors merged into one factor , and the initial eigenvalue explained the greater than 50 % of the total variance ( Podsakoff et al . 2012 ) . It means Table 1 Measurement model Items were removed which are under loading 0 . 70 ; it is denoted with * and not included in the final struc - tural model analysis α Cronbach’s alpha , CR composite reliability , AVE average variance extracted , VIF variance inflation factor Variable and constructs Loadings α CR AVE VIF Counterproductive work behavior 0 . 948 0 . 956 0 . 733 CWB1 0 . 833 2 . 612 CWB2 0 . 853 3 . 036 CWB3 0 . 851 3 . 185 CWB4 0 . 843 2 . 941 CWB5 0 . 860 3 . 132 CWB6 0 . 853 2 . 888 CWB7 0 . 871 3 . 123 CWB8 0 . 883 3 . 734 Despotic leadership 0 . 949 0 . 961 0 . 830 DL1 0 . 921 4 . 116 DL2 0 . 921 4 . 569 DL3 0 . 907 3 . 806 DL4 0 . 905 3 . 939 DL5 0 . 902 3 . 494 DL6 0 . 562 * 3 . 261 Emotional exhaustion 0 . 938 0 . 949 0 . 698 EE1 0 . 870 3 . 673 EE2 0 . 845 3 . 430 EE3 0 . 531 * 5 . 521 EE4 0 . 863 3 . 046 EE5 0 . 830 2 . 575 EE6 0 . 826 2 . 762 EE7 0 . 834 3 . 015 EE8 0 . 799 2 . 467 EE9 0 . 813 2 . 501 Organizational cynicism 0 . 955 0 . 960 0 . 668 OC1 0 . 833 3 . 643 OC2 0 . 831 3 . 527 OC3 0 . 798 2 . 807 OC4 0 . 770 3 . 045 OC5 0 . 832 3 . 425 OC6 0 . 825 3 . 454 OC7 0 . 832 3 . 232 OC8 0 . 840 3 . 248 OC9 0 . 834 3 . 323 OC10 0 . 782 3 . 233 OC11 0 . 826 3 . 207 OC12 0 . 799 2 . 963 608 Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology ( 2021 ) 36 : 603 – 615 1 3 there is an issue of common method bias . Moreover , we perform factor reduction analysis using a rotated matrix test , and all the factors merged into one factor , and the first factor explained 38 . 51 % less than 50 % of the total variance . Thus , there is no common method bias issue in the data . Assessment of Measurement Model The fitness of the measurement model was checked through reliability , composite reliability , and validity analysis . The reliability of the measurement constructs was assessed with the values of Cronbach’s alpha and composite reliability . As suggested by prior researchers , the values of Cron - bach’s alpha > 0 . 70 and values of composite reliability must be > 0 . 80 thresholds ( Neneh 2019 ; Li et al . 2019 ) . Therefore , it is observed in Table 1 the values of Cronbach’s alpha and composite reliability for despotic leadership ( 0 . 949 , 0 . 961 ) , emotional exhaustion ( 0 . 938 , 0 . 949 ) , counterproductive work behavior ( 0 . 948 , 0 . 956 ) , and organizational cynicism ( 0 . 955 , 0 . 960 ) . Thus , all the values were meeting the criteria of reliability analysis ( Nunally and Bernstein 1978 ) . Moreover , the convergent validity of the measurement constructs was evaluated through the average variance extracted . As recommended by Henseler et al . ( 2015 ) , the values of AVE should be > 0 . 50 . Hence , all the constructs were meeting the criteria of convergent validity ( Bagozzi and Edwards 1998 ) . Besides , to check the issue of multi - collinearity , we used the variance inflation factor test VIF values . According to Aiken et al . ( 1991 ) , the value of VIF should be less than 10 to 5 thresholds . The result of VIF is also shown in Table 1 which indicates that all the values were below the threshold . So , there is no issue of multicol - linearity in the data . Discriminant Validity Discriminant validity was assessed using Fornell and Larcker ( 1981 ) and HTMT ratio . As suggested by previous researchers , both criteria were widely used to evaluate the discriminant validity ( Li et al . 2020 ; Shinnar et al . 2018 ) . According to Henseler et al . ( 2015 ) ’s criteria , the square root of the AVE was higher than the values of correlation . In Table 2 , all the values of the square root of the AVE are greater than correlation values . According to Neneh ( 2019 ) ’s HTMT criteria , the values of discriminant validity must be < 0 . 85 . From Table 3 , it is seen that the highest obtained HTMT value is 0 . 316 . Thus , both the criteria were meeting the standard of discriminant validity . Assessment of Structural Model The structural model was evaluated with the Smart - PLS soft - ware using the bootstrapping method with 5000 sub - samples . The fitness of the structural model was assessed using the value of standardized root mean square residual ( SRMR ) and determi - nation of coefficient ( R 2 ) . According to Henseler et al . ( 2015 ) , an excellent model must have < 0 . 08 of SRMR value and the desired value of R 2 should be > 0 . 1 or 0 ( Chin 1998 ) . Therefore , in Figs . 1 and 2 , results of the structural model had a 0 . 065 SRMR value and explained 25 % variance in emotional exhaustion as well as 32 % variance in the counterproductive work behavior which rec - ommends the fitness value of the structural model . Hypotheses Testing ( Direct Effect ) This study hypothesized the three direct hypotheses , and the results are presented in Table 4 . The first hypothesis related to the direct effect of despotic leadership on counterproduc - tive work behavior . The results of H1 indicate that despotic had a positive and significant influence on counterproductive work behavior ( β = 0 . 177 * * * , t = 2 . 868 , p = 0 . 004 ) . There - fore , H1 was accepted . Moreover , the second hypothesis is associated with despotic leadership and emotional exhaus - tion . The findings indicate that despotic leadership had a positive and significant influence on emotional exhaustion ( β = 0 . 186 * * * , t = 2 . 706 , p = 0 . 007 ) . Thus , H2 was sup - ported . Furthermore , the third hypothesis is related to the direct influence of emotional exhaustion on counterproduc - tive work behavior . The results of H3 show that emotional exhaustion had a positive and significant impact on counter - productive work behavior ( 0 . 229 * * * , t = 4 . 126 , p = 0 . 001 ) . Hence , H3 was also accepted . Table 2 Fornell - Larcker criterion Items with diagonals are the square root of the AVE .

The findings illustrate that emotional exhaustion had a positive and significant indirect influence in the rela - tionship between despotic leadership and counterproductive work behavior ( 0 . 043 * * * , t = 2 . 279 , p = 0 . 023 ) . Furthermore , to check the partial and full mediation effect , we used Hair Jr et al . ( 2017 ) ’s approach using the variance accounted for ( VAF ) . According to this methodology , if the value of VAF is greater than 0 . 2 to 0 . 8 , there is partial mediation , and if the value of VAF is greater than 0 . 8 , there is full mediation . Thus , as observed in Table 6 , the value of VAF ( 20 % ) presents the partial mediation , and hypothesis 4 was also supported . Moderating Effect of Organizational Cynicism This study tested hypothesis H5 , the moderating effect of organizational cynicism in the relationship between despotic leadership and emotional exhaustion . In Table 7 , the results indicate that organizational cynicism had an insignificant influence on emotional exhaustion ( 0 . 081 , t = 1 . 469 , p = 0 . 142 ) , and the interaction between organi - zational cynicism and despotic leadership on emotional exhaustion also had a negative and insignificant impact ( −0 . 096 , t = 1 . 741 , p = 0 . 082 ) . Hence , H5 is not accepted .

Prior researchers indicated that there is a posi - tive effect that is an existence with negative behaviors and interpersonal mistreatment ( Nauman et al . 2018 ; Naseer et al . 2016b ) . Existing studies have endorsed that the negative aspect of supervisory role impacts on indi - vidual performance ( Liu and Loi 2012 ) . Despotic leader - ship nurtures negative role and observed as threatening over some time that may result in unwanted behavior . Therefore , our results are in line with Brender - Ilan and Sheaffer ( 2019 ) who claimed that exposure to destruc - tive treatment with employee leads to increased deviant behavior ( De Hoogh and Den Hartog 2008 ) . Despotic leadership causes pressure , anxiety , and fear to the vic - tims and such situations create a malicious cycle of tire - some destructive behavior . In the context of the Pakistani police culture , this study found that despotic leadership having authoritative behavior with subordinates leads to counterproductive work behavior . Concerning H2 , our results indicate that despotic leadership is positively related to emotional exhaustion . Our results are consistent with the previous researcher’s findings who indicated that individuals with a high level of despotic leadership behavior are more likely to respond negatively and become emotionally exhausted ( Chen et al . 2020 ; Cropanzano et al . 2003 ) . This finding is also similar to prior researchers that despotic leaders have negative and harmful effects intensively when subordinates are anxious ( Erkutlu and Chafra 2018b ) . Regarding H3 , our findings illustrate that emotional exhaustion positively influenced counterproductive work behavior . This result is matched with the prior researchers ( Krischer et al . 2010 ; Mo and Shi 2017 ) who suggested that individuals who are emotionally exhausted by the supervisory behavior lead to attempt counterproductive work behavior which is ultimately unfavorable for the organization . Regarding H4 , we found that emotional exhaustion par - tially mediates the relationship between despotic leadership and counterproductive work behavior . There is a lack of indi - rect effect of emotional exhaustion empirically examined in the past literature . Our results are in line with prior research - ers ( Nauman et al . 2018 ; Yan et al . 2020 ) who explained that emotionally exhausted individuals have stress , anxiety , and harmful feelings when their supervisor’s behavior is unethical and authoritarian with them ; as a result , it leads to counterproductive work behavior . Concerning H5 , our results show that organizational cyni - cism had an insignificant moderating influence in the rela - tionship between despotic leadership and emotional exhaus - tion . Research on the moderating effect of organizational cynicism on despotic leadership and emotional exhaus - tion is not investigated by prior researchers . Therefore , an important contribution of our study was examining the moderating effect of organizational cynicism in the despotic leadership and emotional exhaustion relationship . Scholars have explained the vigorous importance of organizational cynicism and counterproductive work behavior ( Sak 2018 ) . Organizational cynicism related to the individual uncon - structive behavior toward organization , and that behavior ultimately leads to counterproductive work behavior . More - over , the role of despotic leadership lacking in moral and ethical feeling since their priority is self - interest only which affect the employee’s performance as well as hurt their emo - tions to behave like emotionally exhausted ( Lebrón et al . 2018 ) . The negative attitude of the despotic leadership led to deviant behavior of employees and stuck them in a way of visionary ethical objectives instead of devotion to the Table 4 Path coefficients ( direct effects ) CWB counterproductive work behavior , DL despotic leadership , EE emotional exhaustion , OC organiza - tional cynicism * p < 0 . 05 ; * * p < 0 . 01 ; * * * p < 0 . 001 Hypotheses Relationship β t R 2 EE = 0 . 251 ; CWB = 0 . 323 p Decision H1 DL → CWB 0 . 177 * * * 2 . 868 0 . 004 Yes H2 DL → EE 0 . 186 * * * 2 . 706 0 . 007 Yes H3 EE → CWB 0 . 229 * * * 4 . 126 0 . 001 Yes Table 5 Specific indirect effect CWB counterproductive work behavior , DL despotic leadership , EE emotional exhaustion * p < 0 . 05 ; * * p < 0 . 01 ; * * * p < 0 . 001 Hypotheses Relationship β Confidence Interval 2 . 5 % 97 . 5 % t p Decision H4 DL → EE → CWB 0 . 043 * * * 0 . 008 0 . 081 2 . 279 0 . 023 Yes 611 Journal of Police and Criminal Psychology ( 2021 ) 36 : 603 – 615 1 3 organization ( Ho 2012 ) . Based on the discussion , it could be inferred that unfair , toxic , immoral , and despotic leaders have low behavioral integrity toward the organization ; as a result , subordinates develop a harmful perception about leaders subsequent in organizational cynicism . This study provides important implications for the dark side of leadership and counterproductive work behavior . We contributed to the existing literature of despotic leader - ship , emotional exhaustion , and organizational cynicism in Pakistan’s police department settings . Moreover , this study contributes to the affective event theory and conservation of resource theory because individual action in the work - place has a positive and negative implication on emotion and behavior . This study also has some practical implications for the police department in Pakistan . Firstly , the idea of despotic leadership has very little attention to pain by such department , even though despotic leadership exists at all the departments of Pakistan . The key aspect may be that such actions are not properly reported due to various factors . The despotic leadership of behavior at the workplace includes several harm effects ; institutions may take actions to reduce its tendency . A typical measure may be adopted to include policies and actions to handle the informed negative and harmful behaviors . Low - rank police officers may be encour - aged to report incidents of despotic leadership behavior at a suitable forum to highlight the issue and perpetrators with the assurance to protect the interests of the victims . Secondly , this study provides the fact that in despotic leadership behavior in the workplace at either positive or negative , it is imperative for the police department to revise the selection criteria and hire suitable candidates in a supervisory role to avoid the issue of counterproductive work behavior . Thirdly , this study established the fact that individuals with a high level of emotional exhaustion are more likely to involve in despotic leadership behavior with the staff . Therefore , to avoid the issues of negative and coun - terproductive work behaviors , the selection of the candidates will be based on psychological and emotional parameters . Moreover , the police department may imply the stand - ard of personal traits by assessment through psychological evaluation , while choosing potential candidates for employ - ment as per the nature of the job and working environment . Furthermore , the police department may take up several intervention strategies and provide advanced - level training programs for low - rank officers to develop their capabilities of handling negative experiences and behaviors from the despotic leaders . Additionally , the counseling desk at human resource departments will help in positive orientations of both supervisory and subordinate staff , for creating a con - ducive work environment . Limitations and Future Directions This study has some limitations for future directions for upcoming researchers . Firstly , due to time constraints and scarce resources , the nature of our study was cross - sectional instead of a longitudinal design . Therefore , we recommend future researchers to conduct a longitudinal mode study using despotic leadership and employee family life for more generalized results . Secondly , the scope of the current study was limited to police personnel’s serving in different police stations of Punjab , Pakistan with a low sample size . Therefore , this study suggests future researchers conduct an empirical study on despotic leadership and the dark side of personalities such as narcissism , psychopathy , and Machi - avellianism to add more contribution in the field of organi - zational behavior and psychology . Thirdly , the findings of our study indicate that the moder - ating effect of organizational cynicism had an insignificant influence on the relationship between despotic leadership and emotional exhaustion with respect to the police depart - ment of Pakistan . The addition of other public and private organizations , for example , banking sectors , education sec - tors , and software companies , may enhance the testing and significance of the results using organizational cynicism predictor .
