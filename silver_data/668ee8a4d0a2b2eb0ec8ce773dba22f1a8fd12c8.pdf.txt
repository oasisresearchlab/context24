Sequence of the SUMO protease Ulp1 was inserted into a pET vector with an N - terminal His6 - tag . All T - plastin constructs and the SUMO protease Ulp1 were expressed in Rosetta2 ( DE3 ) E . coli cells ( Novagen ) grown in LB media at 37°C to an optical density of 0 . 8 - 1 . 0 and induced with 0 . 7 mM IPTG . After induction , the cells were grown for 16 hours at 16°C , then cell pellets were collected and stored at - 80°C until use . Cell pellets were resuspended in Lysis Buffer ( 50 mM Tris - Cl pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 % v / v glycerol , 2 mM β - mercaptoethanol , 20 mM imidazole ) and lysed with an Avestin Emulsiflex C5 homogenizer , after which the lysate was clarified at 15 , 000 g for 30 minutes . Cleared lysate was incubated with Ni - NTA resin ( Qiagen ) for 1 hour on a rotator at 4°C , after which the flow - through was discarded and the resin was washed with 5 bed volumes of lysis buffer . Proteins were subsequently eluted in Elution Buffer ( 50 mM Tris - Cl pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 % v / v glycerol , 2 mM β - mercaptoethanol , 300 mM imidazole ) . Purified His - tagged SUMO protease Ulp1 was then added at 0 . 05 mg / ml working concentration into the protein solutions of SUMO - tagged proteins , then the protein solution was dialyzed against Dialysis Buffer ( 20 mM Tris - Cl pH 8 . 0 , 300 mM NaCl , 5 % v / v glycerol , 2 mM β - mercaptoethanol ) for 16 hours . The protein solution was then reapplied to Ni - NTA resin , and the flow - through was collected . Protein was then sequentially purified by a HiTrapQ HP anion exchange column ( GE Healthcare ) followed by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 Increase column ( GE Healthcare ) in Gel Filtration Buffer ( 20 mM Tris - Cl pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 % v / v glycerol , 2 mM β - mercaptoethanol ) supplemented with 10 % v / v glycerol , then snap - frozen in liquid Nitrogen and stored at - 80°C . 3 Cryo - EM sample preparation and data collection Filamentous actin ( F - actin ) was polymerized in G - Mg ( 2 mM Tris - Cl pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 2 M ATP , 0 . 01 % NaN 3 , 0 . 1 mM MgCl 2 ) and KMEI ( 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM imidazole pH 7 . 0 , 1mM DTT ) buffers as described previously ( 1 ) from 5µM globular actin ( G - actin ) monomers at room temperature for 1 hr , then diluted to 0 . 6 μM in KMEI prior to use . Full - length human T - plastin was buffer exchanged into KMEI or Ca - KMEI ( KMEI buffer + 2mM CaCl 2 ) by desalting column ( GE PD SpinTrap G - 25 ) and was maintained at a concentration of 20 μM . All KMEI buffers were supplemented with 1 mM DTT and 0 . 05 % NP - 40 . Immediately prior to sample preparation , CF - 1 . 2 / 1 . 3 - 3Au 300 - mesh gold C - flat holey carbon cryo - TEM grids ( Protochips ) were plasma cleaned with a Hydrogen / Oxygen mixture for 5 seconds in a Gatan Solarus . Actin solution ( 3 μl ) was first applied to the grid in the humidified chamber of a Leica EM GP plunge freezer and incubated for 60 s at 25°C . T - plastin solution ( 3 μl ) was then applied and incubated for 30 s . Solution ( 3 μl ) was then removed and an additional 3 μl of T - plastin solution was applied . After an additional 30 s , the grid was back - blotted for 5 s , plunge - frozen in ethane slush , and stored in liquid Nitrogen until imaging . Cryo - EM data for the T - plastin – actin ( – Ca 2 + ) complex were recorded on a Titan Krios ( ThermoFisher / FEI ) at the Rockefeller University operated at 300 kV equipped with a Gatan K2 Summit camera . SerialEM ( 2 ) was used for automated data collection . Movies were collected at a nominal magnification of 29 , 000X in super - resolution mode resulting with a calibrated pixel size of 1 . 03 Å / pixel ( super - resolution pixel size of 0 . 515 Å / pixel ) , over a defocus range of - 1 . 5 to - 3 . 5 μm . 40 frames were recorded over 10 s of exposure at a dose rate of 6 electrons per pixel per second ( 1 . 5 electrons per Å 2 per second ) for a cumulative dose of 60 electrons per Å 2 . The T - plastin – actin ( + Ca 2 + ) dataset was recorded at the New York Structural Biology Center ( NYSBC ) on a Titan Krios operated at 300 kV also equipped with a Gatan K2 Summit camera . Movies were collected in counting mode resulting in a calibrated pixel size of 1 . 06 Å / pixel , over a defocus range of - 1 . 5 to - 3 . 5 μm . 50 frames were recorded over 10 s of exposure at a dose rate of 1 . 34 electrons per pixel per second ( 1 . 42 electrons per Å 2 per second ) for a cumulative dose of 71 . 02 electrons per Å 2 . 4 High - resolution cryo - EM image processing Unless otherwise noted , all image processing was performed within the RELION - 3 . 0 package ( 3 ) , following a recently described procedure ( 4 ) . Movie frames were aligned and summed with 2 x 2 binning for the – Ca 2 + dataset , and no binning for the + Ca 2 + dataset , using the MotionCor2 algorithm ( 5 ) implemented in RELION ( 6 ) with 5 × 5 patches . The contrast transfer function ( CTF ) was estimated from non - doseweighted summed images with CTFFIND4 ( 7 ) . Bimodal angular searches with psi angle priors were used in all subsequent 2D and 3D alignment / classification procedures . Approximately 2 , 000 segments were initially manually picked , extracted , and subjected to 2D classification to generate templates for auto - picking . Helical auto - picking was then performed with a step - size of 3 asymmetric units corresponding to a 27 Å helical rise . Segments were extracted from dose - weighted ( 8 ) sum images in 512 x 512 pixel boxes without down - sampling , followed by a second round of 2D classification and auto - picking with featureful class averages . Auto - picked segments were then extracted and subjected to 2D classification using a 200 Å tube diameter and 300 Å mask diameter . Segments that contributed to featureful class averages were selected for 3D analysis . All subsequent 3D analysis steps were primed with estimates of helical rise and twist of 27 . 0 Å and - 167 . 0° , respectively , utilizing an initial reference low - pass filtered to 35 Å resolution , with the outer tube diameter set to 200 Å , inner tube diameter set to - 1 , and the mask diameter set to 300 Å . The first round of 3D classification into 3 classes was performed with bare actin filament reconstruction ( EMBD - 7115 ) as the initial reference . A second iteration was then performed with a class featuring clear ABP density from the first round as the initial reference . For the T - plastin – actin ( – Ca 2 + ) dataset , this second round of 3D classification yielded two classes with helical parameters similar to the initial estimates and well - resolved 3D features , and one junk class with aberrant helical parameters and distorted features . For T - plastin – actin ( + Ca 2 + ) dataset , all three classes were good , featureful 3D classes , indicating the high quality of this dataset . Segments contributing to the selected classes were then pooled for 3D auto - refinement . The first round of auto - refinement was then performed using one good 3D class as the initial reference . All masks for subsequent post - processing steps were calculated with 0 pixel 5 extension and a 6 pixel soft edge from the corresponding converged reconstruction , low - pass filtered to 15 Å and thresholded to fully encompass the density . First - round post - processing was performed with a 50 % z length mask , followed by CTF refinement without beam - tilt estimation and Bayesian polishing ( 6 ) . A second round of auto - refinement was then performed , followed by post - processing with a 30 % z length mask , then a second round of CTF refinement with beam - tilt estimation and Bayesian polishing . Final auto - refinement was then performed , once again employing a 30 % z length mask for post processing . The final reconstructions converged with helical rise of 27 . 0 Å and twist of - 166 . 8° for the T - plastin – F - actin ABD - F - actin complex ( – Ca 2 + ) , and a helical rise of 27 . 4 Å and twist of - 166 . 8° for the T - plastin – F - actin ABD - F - actin complex ( + Ca 2 + ) , consistent with our finding that actin rearrangements evoked by T - plastin are minimal ( SI Appendix , Fig . S3B ) . Global resolution estimates were 3 . 4 Å for the full - length T - plastin – F - actin complex ( – Ca 2 + ) , and 2 . 6 Å for the full - length T - plastin – F - actin complex ( + Ca 2 + ) , by the gold - standard Fourier shell correlation ( FSC ) 0 . 143 criterion . The B - factors estimated during post - processing were then used to generate sharpened , local - resolution filtered maps with RELION . Key statistics summarizing high - resolution cryo - EM image processing are reported in SI Appendix , Table S1 . T - plastin pre - bundling state cryo - EM image processing The weak signal in Class I of the – Ca 2 + condition ( SI Appendix , Fig . S2 ) suggested that in a subset of the particle images , signal from an additional CH domain was consistently present in a defined region . To isolate and refine those particles , symmetry expansion and subsequent rounds of focused 3D classification were used to generate a set of 322 , 743 segment images ( SI Appendix , Fig . S6A ) . Using the asymmetric unit and helical parameters from 3D auto - refinement , particles were symmetry expanded . These particles were then re - extracted with recentering of 2D shifts with a box size of 128 pixels at a down - sampled pixel size of 4 . 12 Å and subjected to a consensus 3D auto - refinement . After this consensus refinement , a mask containing only density for the bound ABD and the additional density was used for an initial round of 3D classification with 14 classes and no image alignment . Classes with consistent density were selected and 6 subjected to 3D auto - refinement . The resultant map was used as an updated reference for another round of 3D classification of the original 322 , 743 segment images with 6 classes , using an updated mask . After selecting 147 , 851 segment images from two classes with similarly placed density , a local 3D auto - refinement was performed , which showed substantially increased density in the masked region beyond the bound ABD . Using an updated mask , another round of 3D classification was run with 3 classes and no image alignment . One class , composed of 50 , 077 particles , with good density was selected . These particles were re - extracted at a box size of 384 pixels without down - sampling and locally refined using a 70 % z mask . These particles were then re - extracted with the plastin molecule at the center of the box and re - refined with a 50 % z mask . A subsequent round of 3D classification with 3 classes and no image alignment and was performed , and the best two classes were selected with 31 , 413 particles . After a local 3D auto - refinement , the particles were re - centered on the actin filament to optimize CTF refinement and Bayesian Polishing performance for two rounds . During the second round of particle polishing , the particles were once again re - centered on the bound T - plastin protein . Polished particles were subjected to a final 3D auto - refinement , which yielded a map assessed at 4 . 4 Å resolution . A final , local 3D auto - refinement was performed by masking only the plastin and two actin protomers to give the final map at 6 . 9 Å resolution ( SI Appendix , Fig . S6 ) within this masked region . Measurement of inter - filament distances To provide reasonable inter - filament distances for the synthetic particles used to train the neural network , the distances between obvious filament bundles lying perpendicular to the electron beam were measured . Specifically , 98 micrographs were selected , down - sampled by 4 , and low pass – filtered to 25 Å . One to four filament bundles were analyzed per micrograph ( total of 127 filament pairs ) , by drawing a line through the central axis of one filament and drawing a parallel line through the axis of the other filament in the bundle using FIJI ( 9 ) . The distance was measured based on the system of equations : y1 = m * x + b1 ; y 2 = m * x + b 2 ; d = | b 2 - b 1 | / √ ( m 2 + 1 ) , where m is the shared slope between the two parallel lines , b1 and b2 are the intercepts for the 7 lines , x and y are the coordinates along the lines , and d is the distance between the two lines . These measurements revealed an average inter - filament distance of 159 Å with a standard deviation of 24 Å ( SI Appendix , Fig S7B ) . Synthetic dataset generation We developed a convolutional neural network - based approach to specifically identify bundled filaments , while excluding individual filaments . To achieve full - micrograph segmentation , a neural network was first trained to recognize potential bundle configurations in synthetic data , and then used to predict on real data . We first trained a denoising autoencoder on projections of plausible in silico bundle models and used the learned weights from this network to make a semantic segmentation network . The precise workflow for synthetic projection generation is outlined in SI Appendix , Fig . S8 . Briefly , projection images were generated of zero to three filament units , with each filament unit consisting of either an individual filament or a two - filament bundle . To approximately reflect the frequency of bundles in the actual dataset , each filament unit had a 65 % chance of being a bundle and 35 % chance of being an individual filament . If the filament unit was a bundle , the filament would be copied , and the copy would be rotated about its helical axis by a random , uniformly sampled integer between 0° and 359° , randomly tilted by a bimodal Gaussian centered at 0° and 90° , with standard deviations of 1 . 5° , and then randomly translated in the y - direction by 159 Å ± 24 Å ( empirically measured from 127 bundles in real micrographs ) , and uniformly translated in the z - direction ( along the helical axis ) by ±181 Å . Subsequently , for both individual and bundled filament units , the filament unit would be rotated about the phi and rot angles by a random , uniformly sampled value between 0° and 359° , and the tilt by 0° with a standard deviation of 2 . 5° . The filament unit was then randomly translated around the box by ±250 Å and projected along the z - axis to generate a noiseless projection . The same map was used to generate a noisy image paired with this noiseless projection , by adding pink noise in Fourier space , as implemented in EMAN2’s python package to generate realistic - looking synthetic data ( 10 ) . Three - channel stacks of semantic maps associated with the noisy / noiseless projection pairs 8 were generated by binarizing the filament unit and assigning it as a bundle or individual filament before projection . Network architecture and training A denoising autoencoder ( DAE ) was trained using the architecture outlined in SI Appendix , Fig . S9A . Each trainable layer had a ReLU activation function , except the final layer which had a linear activation function . The negative of the cross - correlation coefficient was used as the loss function . For training , the weights were initialized using the default initialization in TensorFlow . The model was trained using the Adam optimizer version of stochastic gradient descent with a learning rate of 0 . 00005 and minibatch size of 16 until the model converged ( no improvement in validation loss for 3 epochs ) . Upon network convergence , the weights from the best epoch were restored . For training , 300 , 000 noisy / noiseless projection pairs with box sizes of 192 x 192 were generated , 90 % of which was used for training and 10 % for validation . Upon network convergence , the denoising autoencoder had an average cross - correlation coefficient of 0 . 984 on the validation set . After training the model as a DAE , a semantic segmentation network was trained by copying all layers and weights of the DAE , except for the final layer , which was replaced with a 3 - channel layer with softmax activation and default TensorFlow initialization . This semantic segmentation network was then trained with a learning rate of 0 . 00001 . For training , 50 , 000 pairs of noisy inputs and semantically segmented targets of dimension 192 x 192 and 192 x 192 x 3 , respectively , were used with a minibatch size of 16 ; 90 % of the synthetic data was used for training and 10 % for validation . The loss function was categorical cross - entropy , and upon network convergence the model had a categorical cross - entropy of 0 . 069 on the validation set . Example network performance on synthetic data is shown in SI Appendix , Fig . S9A , B . Models were trained on a single NVIDIA 2080 Ti GPU with 11 GB of VRAM . Training required approximately 2 . 25 hours per epoch for the denoising autoencoder and 0 . 3 hours per epoch for the semantic segmentation network . Validation loss began to plateau around the fifth epoch for both models and then slowly improved until convergence ( SI Appendix , Fig . S9C ) . As a 9 separate estimate of the 2D denoising reconstruction’s resolution , 10 , 000 noiseless synthetic particle images not used during network training or validation were compared to noisy particle images denoised using the trained DAE , and the Fourier Ring Correlation ( FRC ) was computed ( SI Appendix , Fig . S9D ) ; the average FRC curve fell below 0 . 5 at 12 . 2 Å ( ~ 1 . 5 times Nyquist resolution ) , and 100 example FRC curves are also shown . Particle picking using neural network To pick particles , motion - corrected micrographs down - sampled by 4 were converted into semantic maps by extracting 192 - pixel boxes across the micrograph in a raster pattern with 48 pixels of overlap and stitching back the output into a semantic map by computing a maximum intensity projection of the overlapping regions . Only the bundle channel results were used , and they were binarized using a fixed threshold of 0 . 85 . After binarization , central axes of the bundles were selected for by excluding pixels near object borders using empirically derived parameters , and small objects were removed . The remaining binarized image was skeletonized , and non - maximum suppression was used to ensure all particle picks were spaced at least 148 Å away from each other . These particle coordinates were used for extraction in RELION . Comparison to other particle pickers To assess the capabilities of commonly used particle - picking software for the purpose of specifically picking bundles , we employed Topaz ( 11 ) , crYOLO ( 12 ) , and RELION’s template - based auto - picker ( 3 ) on a subset of micrographs from the - Ca 2 + dataset . Specifically , 50 micrographs with combinations of single - and multi - filament F - actin instances were selected ; 25 micrographs were used for manual picking to train the networks , and 25 micrographs were used for assessment of picking quality and agreement with the neural network - based segmentation outlined in our work . A total of 3 , 377 particle coordinates of two - filament bundles , precisely centered , were hand - picked and used to train a crYOLO network using default parameters ( PhosaurusNet architecture , batch size of 4 , learning rate of 0 . 0001 , trained for 200 epochs ) . After a network was trained , picking was performed on the test set of micrographs , and a 10 threshold of 0 . 25 was found to be optimal for picking performance . For Topaz training , the Topaz auto - picking feature as integrated into RELION4 . 0 ( 13 ) was used with the default parameters , except training was done for 15 epochs , instead of the default of 10 , to improve results . After training , picking was performed on the test set of micrographs , and a - 0 . 6 figure - of - merit threshold was found to be optimal for picking performance . Notably , in our experience , the crYOLO results had a large range of acceptable thresholds that produced similar results . Similarly , for our picker , a wide range of binarization thresholds applied to the semantically segmented map yielded very similar results because of the high network confidence . Conversely , for both Topaz and RELION’s auto - picker , changing the threshold slightly drastically changed the number of picks , and we found the defaults had extremely high false - positive picks . Particle picks from the various software were compared by visual inspection and quantitative comparison to the semantic segmentation from our neural network ( SI Appendix , Fig . S11 ) . Picks were visually assessed for their accuracy in centering the particle picks , and ability to discriminate single - from multi - filament bundles ( SI Appendix , Fig . S11A ) . To assess agreement with our network’s semantic segmentation of micrographs in the test set , picks were categorized based on which semantic bin the coordinate was positioned . For example , a picked coordinate that was in the bundle semantic channel was counted as a “true positive” in this case . Whereas a coordinate positioned on a pixel identified by the neural network as a single - filament was counted as a single filament pick , and the remaining picks were scored as background picks . Notably , the semantic maps are intentionally eroded to allow for good centering in our software , so many close , but un - centered picks were marked as background in this analysis ( intentionally to account for pick centering ) . Bundle processing Visual inspection revealed that nearly all extracted particles had multiple filaments , but reference - free 2D classification with standard parameters produced classes with one filament or one well - resolved filament and one poorly resolved filament ( SI Appendix , Fig . S7C ) . To prevent alignment from refining one filament at the expense of the other , particles images were extracted 11 in a large , 256 - pixel box downsampled to 4 . 12 Å pixel size , and multiple rounds of 2D classification were performed in cryoSPARC ( 14 ) , limiting the reconstruction resolution to 45 Å and the alignment resolution to 50 Å ( SI Appendix , Fig . S12A ) . The “Align filament classes vertically” option was used to determine in - plane rotation , and at each iteration , 2D class averages were re - centered using a binary mask with a low threshold to maintain the bundle in the class average center . Particles were re - extracted with shifted , re - centered coordinates and psi angles were rotated by 90° for RELION helical conventions . With these re - centered particles , 2D classification with small translations yielded high - quality , reference - free 2D class averages in RELION , where obvious parallel and antiparallel 2D classes were present ( SI Appendix , Fig . S12B ) . Despite exhaustive attempts at generating reasonable initial models using ab initio model generation , models would frequently be produced with one filament centered in the box or two poorly defined filaments . Therefore , using the reference - free 2D class averages , initial models were generated using a custom projection - matching scheme . The map derived from single - filament helical analysis was rescaled and roughly positioned in the box to project onto one of the two filaments , then EMAN2’s e2classvsproj script ( 10 ) was used on each filament to globally search Euler angles ( with 10 degree sampling ) and shifts ( maximum of 84 Å ) for an initial projection - match to the 2D class average . Finally , a custom projection - matching script using the EMAN2 python package was used to perform a finer , gradient - descent - based projection matching of each filament . While these projections had excellent correspondence to the 2D class averages , they did not have full 3D information to properly position filaments for an initial model . To properly z - position the filaments , a parallax - based approach using 2D classes that had clear side - views was used , and adjustments to the relative z - positions of the oriented filament maps was performed to maximize the cross - correlation between the side - view 2D class averages and the 3D models ( SI Appendix , Fig . S12C ) . These maps were then lowpass filtered to 20 Å and used as initial references for 3D classification ( SI Appendix , Fig . S12D ) . 3D classification required careful angular and translational searches to prevent head - on two - filament images from shifting to side - on views of one filament . An approach similar to 12 previous 3D classification schemes of large , mixed - population filamentous structures was used ( 15 ) . Briefly , the tilt prior was kept fixed at 90° and global searches of rot , local , bimodal searches of psi , and local searches of tilt with 3 . 7° sampling and a 20° search range were performed , with a translation search range of 41 . 2 Å . After one iteration with these parameters , the 3D classification was interrupted ; the tilt prior was updated , and translations were deleted . The 3D classification then resumed for three iterations , with global searches of rot , local , bimodal searches of psi , and local searches of tilt with a fine 1 . 8° sampling and 5° search range , and a large 123 . 6 Å translational search range was used . During this supervised 3D classification , there was an apparent preferred orientation for particular rot angles ( SI Appendix , Fig . S13A ) . 2D classification of particles with rot angles of 0±15° or 180±15° revealed that some side - on view 2D class averages look similar to individual filaments , and their constituent particle images were either bundled particles shifted to have one filament in the box center or poorly picked individual filaments . 2D classes with one centered filament that was much better resolved than other 2D classes were excluded and the angular distribution improved ( SI Appendix , Fig . S13A , B ) . After this winnowing , five more iterations of 3D classification were performed with a smaller translational search of 20 . 6 Å , leading to 87 , 980 particles sorted into the parallel class and 69 , 408 particles sorted into the antiparallel class ( SI Appendix , Fig . S13C ) . A 45 % z - mask was generated for both classes , and subsequent signal subtraction and focused 3D classification without alignment removed particles without clear bridging plastin density . Un - subtracted particles were re - substituted , and following a consensus 3D auto - refinement , particles overlapping within the masked region were removed . A final , asymmetric , consensus 3D auto - refinement was performed on 41 , 701 particles for the parallel class , which reached 9 . 0 Å , and 28 , 759 particles for the antiparallel class , which was assessed at 10 . 0 Å ( SI Appendix , Fig . S13D ) . Variability analysis During 3D auto - refinement , it became apparent that filament density quickly smeared outside the masked region , presumably due to the relative flexibility of the complex . This 13 observation , coupled with the composition of the system being two rigid bodies connected by a flexible cross - linking protein , led us to employ multi - body refinement , as implemented in RELION , to handle flexural heterogeneity ( 16 ) . Using default 3D multi - body refinement parameters , with masks shown in SI Appendix , Fig . S13C , the resolution of the constituent filaments improved . Furthermore , we reasoned we could utilize the multi - body refinement parameters to measure the relative motions of the two filaments to each other . Specifically , volumes were generated for each particle image using RELION’s relion _ flex _ analyze script ( 41 , 701 volumes for parallel , and 28 , 759 volumes for antiparallel ) , and atomic models of two separate plastin - decorated actin filaments were procedurally rigid - body docked into each of the volumes using scripting functions in UCSF Chimera ( 17 ) . Distances and measurements between these docked models were measured using custom scripts employing functions from the ProDy package ( 18 ) . Plots were generated with GraphPad Prism ( Fig . 3E - H ) . Model building and refinement To generate homology models of the actin - binding ‘core’ ( Fig . 1B ) of plastin , the Robetta server was used ( 19 ) . The selected homology model for ‘prebound’ T - plastin was the model that had the highest score . Sharpened , local - resolution - filtered maps as described above were used for model building . The high - resolution density maps were of sufficient quality for de novo atomic model building . As structures of components were available , initial models of actin ( PDB 3j8a ) and the ‘prebound’ T - plastin homology model were fit into the density map using Rosetta ( 20 ) . Models were subsequently inspected and adjusted with Coot ( 21 , 22 ) , and regions that underwent significant conformational rearrangements were manually rebuilt . The models were then subjected to several rounds of simulated annealing followed by real - space refinement in Phenix ( 23 , 24 ) alternating with manual adjustment in Coot . A final round of real - space refinement was performed without simulated annealing . The pseudo - atomic models for the T - plastin prebundling state ( Fig . 2 ) and both T - plastin bundle configurations ( Fig . 3 ) were generated by rigid - body docking the high - resolution postbound T - plastin model and ABD1 fragments from the ‘prebound’ homology model , followed 14 by flexible fitting with ISOLDE ( 25 ) , then real - space refinement in Phenix with harmonic restraints on the starting model enabled . Key statistics summarizing model building , refinement , and validation are reported in SI Appendix , Tables S1 and S2 . Structural figures and movies were prepared with ChimeraX ( 26 ) . Structural superpositions were performed with the MatchMaker function in ChimeraX . Pruned RMSD , which excludes poorly aligning regions such as flexible loops , was calculated with the default parameters . Per - residue RMSD analysis was performed with UCSF Chimera ( 17 ) as previously described ( 27 ) . The surface area of actin - binding interfaces was calculated with PDBePISA ( 28 ) ( EMBL - EBI ) . Model quality was assessed with EMRinger ( 29 ) and MolProbity ( 30 ) as implemented in Phenix . Sequence alignments Protein sequences of human I - plastin ( Q14651 ) , human L - plastin ( P13796 ) , human T - plastin ( P13797 ) were aligned with ClustalOmega ( 31 ) ( EMBL - EBI ) . Actin co - sedimentation assays Mixtures of F - actin ( 5 µ M ) and the indicated T - plastin constructs ( 2 µ M ) were incubated at room temperature for 30 min in co - sedimentation buffer ( 10 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 100 mM KCl , 2 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , and 2 mM DTT . The samples were then spun for 30 min . at 16 , 000 rpm ( low - speed ) in a TLA - 100 rotor and polycarbonate centrifugation tubes ( Beckman Coulter No . 343775 ) . This pellet was the ‘low - speed’ pellet . The supernatant was taken out from the centrifugation tube and then spun in a fresh centrifugation tube for another 30 min , at 100 , 000 rpm ( high - speed ) . This pellet was the ‘high - speed’ pellet , and the supernatant was also collected . All three fractions were subject to SDS - PAGE and Coomassie staining . The gels were scanned using LI - COR imaging system , and subsequently quantified with ImageJ . Plots were generated with GraphPad Prism , and statistical analysis was performed with Microsoft Excel . 15 Cell culture and transfections All experiments using HUVEC were performed with an hTERT - immortalized HUVEC line previously described ( 32 ) and cultured in EGM - 2 media ( Lonza , CC - 3162 ) . Cultures were regularly monitored for mycoplasma contamination via a PCR assay . For transient DNA transfections , 1 . 5 × 10 4 HUVEC , were plated the day before transfection in a glass - bottom 96 - well plate ( Cellvis ) coated with 31 µg / mL collagen ( Advanced BioMatrix , 5005 - 100 ML ) . The day of transfection , culture medium was replaced with 80 µL of antibiotics - free culture media per well . Then , 0 . 2 µg DNA encoding GFP - tagged T - Plastin ( WT or mutant ) and 0 . 25 µL Lipofectamine2000 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , mixed in 20 µL OptiMEM ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , was added following the manufacturer’s instructions . This transfection mix was replaced after 3 h with culture media and cells were processed for imaging after 24 h . Fixed fluorescence imaging of cells For fixed imaging , cells were rapidly fixed in 37 °C 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS , washed in PBS , permeabilized in 0 . 2 % TritonX - 100 in PBS , washed again and blocked in 3 % FBS in PBS prior to primary and secondary antibody staining . Phalloidin conjugated to Alexa Fluor 568 ( A12380 , used at 1 : 500 ) and a secondary antibody against mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 647 ( A21235 , used at 1 : 500 ) were from Thermo Fisher Scientific . The mouse monoclonal antibody against Arp3 ( A5979 , used at 1 : 250 ) was from Sigma . All images were acquired on an automated confocal system controlled by Slidebook software ( Intelligent Imaging Innovations , 3i ) . The system consists of an Eclipse - Ti body with perfect focus system ( Nikon Instruments ) , CSU - W1 spinning disc ( Yokogawa ) , a 3i laser stack with 405 , 445 , 488 , 515 , 561 , and 640 nm lines , an environmental chamber ( Haison ) , a 60X 1 . 27 NA water immersion objective , and two Zyla 4 . 2 sCMOS cameras ( Andor ) with motorized dichroics enabling simultaneous acquisition of channels . 16 FRAP assays and quantification For live imaging , cell culture media was replaced with extracellular buffer ( ECB ) consisting of 125 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 1 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 . 5 mM CaCl 2 , 20 mM HEPES , supplemented with 10 mM D - glucose , 1 % FBS , and 5 ng / mL bFGF ( R & D Systems , 223 - FB ) . To avoid interference from lamellipodial protrusion / retraction cycles on T - Plastin recovery measurements , HUVEC were first treated with 20 µM Y - 27632 for 20 min . , then a cocktail of 20 µM Y - 27632 , 8 µM Jasplakinolide , and 5 µM Latrunculin - B ( JLY ) for 30 min . to freeze actin turnover ( 33 ) . Regions representing protrusions containing GFP - tagged T - plastin were selected for photobleaching with high intensity 488 nm laser light ( Vector , Intelligent Imaging Innovations ) and imaged every second for at least 3 minutes . Analysis regions were subsequently defined in Slidebook to exclude the ends of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions , and the region intensities were measured to quantify their recovery after photobleaching . Intensities were background subtracted and normalized to their pre - bleach intensity , then analyzed in GraphPad Prism by fitting to an exponential one - phase association model , Y = Y 0 + ( Plateau - Y 0 ) * ( 1 - e ( - K * x ) ) . Wild - type and mutant data were compared using a two - way ANOVA with a mixed - effects model and Geisser - Greenhouse correction ( SI Appendix , Table S3 ) . 17 Fig .
