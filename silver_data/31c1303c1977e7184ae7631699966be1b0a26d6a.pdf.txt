Andalman , Michale S . Fee * Young animals engage in variable exploratory behaviors essential for the development of neural circuitry and adult motor control , yet the neural basis of these behaviors is largely unknown . Juvenile songbirds produce subsong — a succession of primitive vocalizations akin to human babbling . We found that subsong production in zebra finches does not require HVC ( high vocal center ) , a key premotor area for singing in adult birds , but does require LMAN ( lateral magnocellular nucleus of the nidopallium ) , a forebrain nucleus involved in learning but not in adult singing . During babbling , neurons in LMAN exhibited premotor correlations to vocal output on a fast time scale . Thus , juvenile singing is driven by a circuit distinct from that which produces the adult behavior — a separation possibly general to other developing motor systems . H ow does a young brain learn to use the muscles it controls and the sensory or - gans by which it perceives the world ? To a surprising extent , this knowledge is not built in by deterministic developmental rules but must be obtained through exploration . For instance , the relationship between feedback from the somatosensory periphery and movement is revealed to the developing brain by spontane - ous muscle twitches , which facilitate the self - organization of spinal reflex circuits ( 1 ) and cortical somatosensory maps ( 2 , 3 ) . At a higher level , juvenile animals learn the causal relation between actionsandtheeffectsoftheseactionsbyproducinghighlyvariablebehaviorssuchasinfantstepping , grasp - like “ hand babbling , ” early vocalizations , and play ( 4 – 8 ) . How are these exploratory juvenile behaviors generated ? Are they produced by the same brain areas responsible for the corresponding adult be - haviors later in life , or are specialized brain re - gions involved ? Forebrain areas , including the motor cortex and the basal ganglia , have been im - plicated in the production of normal infant move - ments , as well as their abnormalities ( 5 , 9 – 11 ) . Yet the specific forebrain circuits for infant motor control remain to be identified . Babbling is an early motor behavior pro - duced by juveniles of vocal mammals and birds ( 6 , 12 – 15 ) . In zebra finches , babbling , called subsong , occurs roughly from ages 30 to 45 days post - hatch ( dph ) . Plastic song follows , with the gradualappearanceofdistinctandidentifiable , but variable , vocal elements ( syllables ) . By 80 to 90 dph , plastic song is gradually transformed into highly complex , stereotyped motifs — sequences of syllables that constitute adult song . The premotor circuit for adult song production consists of HVC ( high vocal center ) , RA ( robust nucleus of the arcopallium ) , and brainstem motor nuclei ( Fig . 1A ) . This “ motor pathway ” is crucial for gen - erating stereotyped , learned vocalizations ( 16 , 17 ) and exhibits firing that is precisely time - locked to the song output ( 18 – 21 ) . Another circuit , the anterior forebrain path - way ( AFP ) , is homologous to basal ganglia thalamocortical loops in mammals and projects to RA through a forebrain nucleus , LMAN ( lat - eral magnocellular nucleus of the nidopallium ) ( 22 , 23 ) . Although LMAN is not required for singing in adult birds , it is necessary for normal song learning in juveniles ( 24 , 25 ) and plays a role in producing song variability in adult and juvenile birds ( 26 , 27 ) . These and other studies have suggested a view that the motor pathway drives singing , whereas the output of the AFP modulates or instructs the motor pathway during learning ( 28 , 29 ) . Subsong persists in the absence of HVC . We investigated whether primitive subsong vo - calizations result from an immature form of the adult motor pathway , or whether they are driven by other premotor circuits . Given the impor - tance of HVC for mature singing ( 16 , 20 , 30 ) , we sought to characterize its involvement early in development . In nine subsong - producing ju - venile birds ( ages 33 to 44 dph ) , we eliminated HVC bilaterally , either by electrolytic lesions or by pharmacological inactivation ( 31 ) . In three additional birds , we left HVC intact but specif - ically eliminated its projection to RA by bilat - eral transection of the HVC - to - RA fiber tract . After these manipulations , all birds continued producing largely unaffected subsong ( Fig . 1A and fig . S3 ) . Surprisingly , older birds — those in the plastic - song stage ( 45 to73dph , n = 12 ) and adults ( n = 5 , undirected singing ) — also sang after bilateral HVC elimination [ but see ( 31 ) ] . These birds lost structure and stereotypy in their songs , reverting to the production of subsong - like vocalizations . After pharmacological inactivation of HVC , this reversion to subsong - like vocalizations was fast ( within 20 min ) and reversible ( fig . S4 ) ; this finding suggested that the effect is not due to long - term changes in neural circuitry , but rather occurs immediately as a result of the loss of spik - ing activity in HVC . At all ages , singing in the absence of HVC was produced at normal rates and followed an ordinary circadian rhythm , with more songs produced in the morning than in later parts of the day ( 31 ) . Singing without HVC is highly similar to normal subsong . We asked whether the sounds produced in the absence of HVC were indeed similar to subsong . We characterized acoustic properties of songs by measuring spectral fea - tures shown to be effective for quantifying de - velopmental trends in zebra finches ( 32 , 33 ) . Distributions of these features before and after HVC elimination were highly similar for subsong - producing birds ( 31 ) . An additional feature of normal subsong is the absence of repeatable acoustic elements of a stereotyped length . This was evident in a wide , unimodal distribution of syllable durations for subsong - producing birds ( n = 9 birds younger than 45 dph ; Fig . 2 , A and B ) . After HVC elimination , these distributions were unchanged ( 31 ) . In contrast , plastic and adult songs contain distinct syllables that form multiple narrow peaks in the distributions of durations . After HVC elimination in older birds , all distinct syllables were lost , resulting in uni - modal distributions similar to those of subsong ( n = 25 birds ) ( 31 ) . Furthermore , subsong is characterized by a lack of sequential stereotypy , which appears later in plastic and adult songs . We quantified stereo - typy by measuring the peak of the spectral cross - correlation between different song renditions ( Fig . 2C ) ( 31 ) . In control conditions , stereotypy was higher for older birds ( Fig . 2D ; P < 0 . 0001 for nonzero slope of the linear regression of stereotypy and age ) . However , independently of age , stereotypy was reduced to the level of sub - song after HVC elimination ( Wilcoxon P > 0 . 1 for the difference from normal subsong ) . In summary , analyses of acoustic structure indicate that , by a wide range of measurements , singing in the absence of HVC is highly similar to normal subsong . Subsong requires activity in RA and LMAN . If subsong persists in the absence of HVC , what neural circuits are engaged in its production ? One possibility is that subsong does not require the forebrain song system and is entirely pro - duced by midbrain or brainstem circuitry , even in the absence of RA . A second possibility is that subsong is driven by circuitry intrinsic to RA , even in the absence of HVC and LMAN . The third possibility is that subsong is driven by , or requires , inputs from LMAN to RA .

RA lesions entirely blocked singing in juve - nile birds ( n = 5 , 39 to 73 dph ) , indicating that subsong - like vocalizations require descending inputs from the forebrain ( Fig . 3 ) . Similarly , song production was abolished by lesions of HVC and subsequent inactivation of LMAN ( n = 12 ex - periments in 5 birds , 51 to 75 dph ) , indicating that RA circuitry , without its afferent inputs , is not sufficient to generate singing . We further tested the necessity of LMAN inputs to RA by inactivating LMAN in juvenile birds . LMAN inactivation entirely abolished subsong production in all birds younger than 45 dph ( n = 6 experiments in 4 birds ) . However , in agreement with previous studies , LMAN inactivation did not block singing in most older birds ( 6 of 7 experiments in 5 birds , 45 to 67 dph ) , although it produced a marked reduction in song variability ( 26 , 27 ) . Together , these results indicate that RA and its inputs from LMAN are necessary for subsong production . LMAN neurons exhibit premotor activity during subsong . An intriguing possibility sug - gested by the above results is that LMAN drives subsong production — i . e . , that it generates pat - terns of spiking activity that control the acoustic structure of subsong on a short ( 10 ms ) time scale . To test this prediction directly , we recorded from single RA - projecting LMAN neurons dur - ing subsong production in intact birds [ n = 15 neurons in 3 birds , 38 to 45 dph ( 31 ) ] and in birds with bilateral HVC lesions ( n = 16 neurons in 2 birds , lesioned at 38 and 50 dph ) . To quan - tify premotor activity , we examined firing in a short window preceding each syllable boundary ( onset or offset ) . To begin with , we only con - sidered syllable boundaries separated from other onsets or offsets by relatively long ( > 150 ms ) periods to eliminate the possible confounding effects of neighboring syllables on the firing pat - tern . There was a significant increase in firing be - fore syllable onsets in 12 of 31 neurons [ 16 . 1 ± 1 . 6 Hz in a 50 - ms window preceding syllable onset versus 8 . 6 ± 0 . 6 Hz in a 100 - ms baseline period preceding this window ; P < 0 . 05 ; e . g . , neuron 3 , Fig . 4 , A and B ( 31 ) ] . Similarly , syllable offsets were preceded by a significant increase in firing in 5 of 31 neurons ( 21 . 2 ± 3 . 4 Hz before syllable offset versus baseline , 15 . 5 ± 1 . 3 Hz ; P < 0 . 05 ; e . g . , neuron 14 , Fig . 4 , C and D ) . Similar neuronal firing patterns related to onsets and offsets of behavioral sequences have been observed in other basal ganglia – related circuits ( 34 ) . In the above analysis , we only considered syllable boundaries separated by long ( > 150 ms ) periods of time to isolate syllable onset - and offset - related changes in firing . However , the firing of some LMAN neurons also correlated with more rapid changes in song structure . For instance , neuron 12 ( Fig . 4 , E to G ) exhibited increased firing before syllables that followed short ( 10 to 150 ms ) rather than long intervals , as well as a reduction in firing during silent pe - riods between syllables . Overall , seven neurons showed a premotor increase in activity before syllables separated by short intervals ( P < 0 . 05 for the comparison of a 30 - ms window preced - ing a syllable with 30 ms of baseline ) . This find - ing suggests that some LMAN neurons may have a premotor relation to subsong structure at the level of individual syllables .

The most likely timing of a burst onset was 17 . 2 ± 3 . 1 ms before syllable onset . Such latency is , in fact , antici - pated for premotor activity in LMAN , given the 10 - to 15 - ms latency reported for vocal pertur - bation after electrical stimulation in RA ( 35 ) and the 2 - to 5 - ms antidromic latency from RA we found in LMAN neurons ( 31 ) . Note that although the exact relationship of firing to song varied across cells , 20 of31neuronswe recorded ( 65 % ) showedsome type of premotor correlation to the vocal output . Premotor firing in LMAN did not require activity within HVC ; 8 of 16 neurons exhibited significant correlations to song struc - ture in HVC - lesioned birds ( fig . S5 ) . Discussion . Our data indicate that LMAN , and possibly other components of the AFP , con - stitute an essential premotor circuit for the production of early babbling . At the same time , we have shown that the classical premotor nucleus HVC ( 16 ) is not necessary for the generation of subsong . We therefore propose that two premotor pathways in the songbird function to produce vocalizations at different stages of development . In young juveniles , the AFP generates poorly structured subsong , whereas in adult birds , the classical HVC - motor pathway generates highly stereotyped motor sequences . These pathways in - teract in the intermediate plastic - song stage ( 27 ) to generate the partially structured but variable vocalizations upon which vocal learning operates . The transfer of functional dominance from one pathway to another during vocal learning el - egantly parallels their anatomical development . HVC does not reach its adult size until the late plastic - song stage ( 36 ) and establishes functional synapses in RA later than LMAN does ( 37 , 38 ) . Song maturation and the decrease in vocal varia - bility have thus been attributed to the strengthen - ing of inputs from HVC and the concurrent weakening of inputs from LMAN ( 39 – 42 ) . Cu - riously , although HVC neurons form synapses in RA around the onset of singing [ 30 to 35 dph ( 37 ) ] , our results show that they do not signif - icantly contribute to song production in its earliest stage . It is therefore possible that the HVC - to - RA pathway is active during early subsong but is not yet functionally strong enough to drive sing - ing by itself or to influence vocalizations in a detectable way . Identifying forebrain circuits involved in the production of juvenile behaviors is a requisite step toward understanding the mechanisms by which sensorimotor learning takes place . Sev - eral models of developmental learning suggest that early motor behaviors originate in the same circuits that later produce adult behavior . In this view , known as neuronal group selection theory , an initially large number of motor patterns un - dergo a selection process through competition , gradually eliminating circuits that produce un - desirablebehaviors ( 9 , 43 – 46 ) . Ourfindings , how - ever , suggest a rather different model in which distinct specialized circuits are dedicated to the 0 200 400 600 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 Duration ( ms ) P r obab ili t y den s i t y 0 200 400 600 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 Duration ( ms ) 0 200 400 600 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 Duration ( ms ) 0 200 400 600 0 0 . 02 0 . 04 0 . 06 0 . 08 0 . 10 Duration ( ms ) P r obab ili t y den s i t y Adult birds ( n = 5 ) Plastic song birds ( n = 12 ) Subsong birds ( n = 9 ) Normal subsong NoHVC - 1 - 0 . 5 0 0 . 5 1 C o rr e l a t i on S ong 1 S ong 1 Song 2 Song 2 - 1 . 5 - 1 - 0 . 5 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 - 0 . 2 0 0 . 4 0 . 6 - 1 . 5 - 1 - 0 . 5 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 - 0 . 2 0 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 2 C o rr e l a t i on 0 . 2 C o rr e l a t i on Lag ( sec ) Lag ( sec ) ControlNo HVC 30 40 50 60 70 Adult 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 Age ( dph ) C o rr e l a t i on controlno HVC B A C No HVC Control Subsong D Plastic song Adult Fig . 2 .

Dresselhaus , 5 Gang Chen , 3 † Zhifeng Ren 1 † The dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit ( ZT ) in bismuth antimony telluride ( BiSbTe ) bulk alloys has remained around 1 for more than 50 years . We show that a peak ZT of 1 . 4 at 100°C can be achieved in a p - type nanocrystalline BiSbTe bulk alloy . These nanocrystalline bulk materials were made by hot pressing nanopowders that were ball - milled from crystalline ingots under inert conditions . Electrical transport measurements , coupled with microstructure studies and modeling , show that the ZT improvement is the result of low thermal conductivity caused by the increased phonon scattering by grain boundaries and defects . More importantly , ZT is about 1 . 2 at room temperature and 0 . 8 at 250°C , which makes these materials useful for cooling and power generation . Cooling devices that use these materials have produced high - temperature differences of 86° , 106° , and 119°C with hot - side temperatures set at 50° , 100° , and 150°C , respectively . This discovery sets the stage for use of a new nanocomposite approach in developing high - performance low - cost bulk thermoelectric materials . S olid - state cooling and power generation based on thermoelectric effects have poten - tial applications in waste - heat recovery , air conditioning , and refrigeration . The efficien - cy of thermoelectric devices is determined by the materials ’ dimensionless figure of merit , de - fined as ZT = ( S 2 s / k ) T , where S , s , k , and T are the Seebeck coefficient , electrical conductivity , thermal conductivity , and absolute tempera - ture , respectively ( 1 – 3 ) . An average ZT in the application temperature range must be higher than 1 to make a thermoelectric device com - petitive ( 1 – 3 ) . There have been persistent efforts to improve ZT values since the 1950s , but the peak ZT of dominant commercial materials based on Bi 2 Te 3 and its alloys , such as Bi x Sb 2 – x Te 3 ( p - type ) , has remained at 1 . During the past decade , sev - eral groups have reported enhanced ZT in ( i ) superlattices such as Bi 2 Te 3 / Sb 2 Te 3 ( 4 ) and PbSe 0 . 98 Te 0 . 02 / PbTe ( 5 ) , because of reductions in the lattice thermal conductivity , and ( ii ) new bulk materials , such as lead antimony silver tel - luride ( LAST ) and its alloys ( 6 ) , including skutte - rudites ( 7 ) . Although high ZT values were reported in superlattice structures , it has proven difficult to use them in large - scale energy - conversion ap - plications because of limitations in both heat transfer and cost . Bulk materials with improved ZT , such as LAST and skutterudites , are ideal for high - temperature operations . However , at rela - tively near room temperature ( 0° to 250°C ) , Bi 2 Te 3 - based materials still dominate . We have pursued an approach in which the pri - mary cause of ZT enhancement in superlattices — reduced thermal conductivity — also exists in ran - dom nanostructures ( 8 , 9 ) . We report a substantial ZT increase in bulk materials made from nano - crystalline ( NC ) powders of p - type Bi x Sb 2 – x Te 3 , reaching a peak ZT of 1 . 4 at 100°C . The enhanced ZT is the result of a significant re - duction in thermal conductivity caused by strong phonon scattering by interfaces in the nanostruc - tures . There have also been reports of ZT im - provements at room temperature in Bi 2 Te 3 - based materials caused by the addition of Bi 2 Te 3 nano - tubes ( 10 ) and by melt spinning ( 11 ) . Our method , on the other hand , is based on the ball milling and hot pressing of nanopar - ticles into bulk ingots . This approach is simple , is cost effective , and can be used on other mate - rials . Our materials have a ZT of about 1 . 2 at room temperature and 0 . 8 at 250°C with a peak of 1 . 4 at 100°C . In comparison , conventional Bi 2 Te 3 - based materials have a peak ZT of about 1 at room temperature and about 0 . 25 at 250°C . The high ZT in the 25° to 250°C temperature range makes the NC bulk materials attractive for cooling and low - grade waste - heat recovery ap - plications . The materials can also be integrated into segmented thermoelectric devices for thermo - electric power generation that operate at high temperatures . In addition to the high ZT values , the NC bulk materials are also isotropic . They do not suffer from the cleavage problem that is common in traditional zone melting – made ingots , which leads to easier device fabrication and sys - tem integration and to a potentially longer de - vice lifetime . Sample preparation . Nanopowders were made by ball milling bulk p - type BiSbTe alloy ingots ( 12 ) . Bulk disk samples ( 1 . 25 to 2 . 5 cm in diameter and 2 to 15 mm in thickness ) were made by hot pressing the nanopowders loaded in 1 . 25 - to 2 . 5 - cm ( inner diameter ) graphite dies ( 12 ) .
