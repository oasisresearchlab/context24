Poster Abstracts • OFID 2017 : 4 ( Suppl 1 ) • S311 9 ) . Nasal specimens were used to detect clinical and colonizing pathogens using the Diatherix TEM - PCR Respiratory Panel . Results . A total of 90 recruits were enrolled in the study . Twelve recruits were lost due to training attrition in the first week of the study . The participants were male and the mean age was 23 yo ( SD 4 . 9 ) . There were 10 ( 13 % ) cases of ILI reported among the 78 remaining participants , 6 in week 1 , 3 in week 2 and 1 in week 9 . The most frequently detected pathogens in the 10 symptomatic cases were coronavirus ( 5 , 50 % ) , rhinovirus ( 4 , 40 % ) , other enterovirus ( 3 , 30 % ) , and influenza A ( 2 , 20 % ) . Pathogen co - detections were common , 8 out 10 cases were associated with 2 pathogens , repre - senting 7 unique combinations . While rhinovirus and coronavirus were most common among asymptomatic trainees , 10 % had detectable influenza A . Detection of multiple pathogens was common in the first two weeks of training ( 50 % among those who had viral detection ) . The study is still in progress . Conclusion . Symptomatic ILI was associated with coronavirus , rhinovirus , and enterovirus , in addition to influenza in the early weeks of training . Coronavirus and rhinovirus also circulated widely among healthy recruits , along with influenza . The findings will inform ILI control strategies for congregated military trainees . Disclosures . E .

Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) and Safety of Intravenous ( IV ) Brincidofovir ( BCV ) in Healthy Adult Subjects Mary Beth Wire , PharmD ; Marion Morrison , MD ; Maggie Anderson , BS ; Thangam Arumugham , PhD ; John Dunn , PhD and Odin Naderer , PharmD ; Chimerix , Durham , North Carolina Session : 139 . Adult Viral Infection Friday , October 6 , 2017 : 12 : 30 PM Background . BCV is a lipid conjugate nucleotide that has shown rapid viral clear - ance in patients with adenovirus infection and improved survival in animal models of smallpox . In preclinical studies in rats , IV BCV dosed twice weekly for up to 29 days was not associated with gastrointestinal ( GI ) , hematopoietic , hepatic , or renal toxicity . This study evaluated the safety and PK of IV BCV in healthy subjects . Methods . In this double - blind study , subjects were randomized 3 : 1 to receive IV BCV or placebo in sequential single ascending dose cohorts ( Table 1 ) . Plasma PK samples were collected over 7 days and assayed by HPLC - MS . Plasma BCV PK param - eters were determined by non - compartmental analysis and dose proportionality was assessed . Safety assessments were collected over 14 days . Results . Forty healthy male subjects ( 18 – 46 years , 83 % White ) were enrolled and completed the study . Plasma BCV Cmax and AUC∞ increased in proportion to dose ( Table 1 ) . AEs and alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) elevations were dose - and infusion duration - related ( Table 1 ) . GI AEs were mild . All AEs and ALT elevations were tran - sient and no serious AEs occurred . Table 1 .

Conclusion . Single doses of BCV 10 – 50 mg administered as a 2h IV infusion were well tolerated and not associated with significant clinical or laboratory abnormal - ities . BCV IV 10 mg and BCV IV 50 mg achieved geometric mean plasma BCV AUC∞ similar to and 4 . 5 - fold , respectively , values achieved with BCV oral 100 mg tablets ( Cmax = 251 ng / mL and AUC∞ = 1394 ng hours / mL ) . These data support evaluation of repeat dose administration in healthy subjects and virally - infected patients . Disclosures . M . B . Wire , Chimerix : Employee and Shareholder , Salary . M .

Adult Viral Infection Friday , October 6 , 2017 : 12 : 30 PM Background . In a Phase III randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study of CMV - seropositive HCT recipients , letermovir prophylaxis significantly reduced the incidence of clinically significant CMV infections ( CS - CMVi ) through 24 weeks post - HCT . We investigated the impact of letermovir prophylaxis on mortality through Week 48 post - HCT . Methods . Adult CMV - seropositive allogeneic HCT recipients with undetectable plasma CMV DNA at screening who could initiate treatment by Week 4 post - HCT were eligible . Subjects stratified by high or low CMV disease risk were randomized 2 : 1 to leter - movir dosed at 480 mg / d ( 240 mg / d if on cyclosporine ) or placebo PO or IV through Week 14 post - HCT . Time to all - cause mortality and non - relapse mortality ( defined as death due to any reason other than the indication for HCT ) through Week 48 post - HCT are presented using Kaplan – Meier ( KM ) plots censored at study discontinuation for rea - sons other than death / non - relapse death or upon study completion . Distribution of time to mortality endpoints was tested by stratified log - rank tests using two - sided P - values . Results . This analysis included all 565 patients randomized and treated with ≥1 dose of study drug . Subjects began study drug a median of 9 days post - HCT ; 36 . 5 % started post - engraftment . The observed KM event rate for all - cause mortality was lower in the letermovir group ( 10 . 6 % ) than the placebo group ( 15 . 5 % ) at Week 24 post - HCT , and remained lower through Week 48 post - HCT ( 21 . 4 % vs . 26 . 2 % ) ( Figure 1 ) . The observed K – M event rate for all - cause mortality in subjects who devel - oped CS - CMVi was also lower in the letermovir group ( 4 . 6 % ) than the placebo group ( 17 . 1 % ) at Week 48 post - HCT . The observed KM event rate for non - relapse mortal - ity was lower in the letermovir group ( 6 . 9 % ) vs . the placebo group ( 11 . 2 % ) at Week 24 post - HCT , and remained lower in the letermovir group ( 13 . 9 % ) than the placebo group ( 17 . 5 % ) through Week 48 post - HCT ( Figure 2 ) . Conclusion . All - cause and non - relapse mortality were reduced in the letermo - vir group compared with the placebo group through Week 48 post - HCT ( relative risk reduction ~ 18 % and ~ 21 % , respectively ) . These results are consistent with a clinically meaningful survival benefit for letermovir prophylaxis . Disclosures . J .
