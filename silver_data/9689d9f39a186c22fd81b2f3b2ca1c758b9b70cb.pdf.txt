Radial centroso(cid:2) mal microtubules involved in generation of the mitotic spindle and noncentrosomal microtubule network are distinguishable in epithelial cells . The latter are responsible for the cell shape , polarization , vesicular transport , and positioning of cellular organelles , e . g . , the Golgi complex ( Bloom and Goldstein , 1998 ; Musch , 2004 ; Suzaki et al . , 2004 ; Canania et al . , 2006 ; Halbleib et al . 2007 ; Weisz and Rodriguez(cid:2)Boulan , 2009 ) . Most noncentrosomal microtubules are oriented along the apical – basal axis with their minus ends directed apically and plus ends oriented toward the basal region ( Bloom and Goldstein , 1998 ; Musch , 2004 ; Canania et al . , 2006 ) . Epithelial cell polariza(cid:2) tion is accompanied by microtubule alignment along the apical – basal axis . Both processes are presumably regulated by the same signaling ( Musch , 2004 ; Rod(cid:2) riguez(cid:2)Boulan et al . , 2005 ; Halbleib et al . , 2007 ; Weisz and Rodriguez(cid:2)Boulan , 2009 ; Jaulin and Kreitzer , 2010 ) . Protein transport in the brush border from the basal area toward the apical cell regions during cell polarization is also associated with the reorganization and stabilization of microtubules ( Jaulin and Kreitzer , 2010 ) . Along with vertical microtubules with equal polar(cid:2) ity , there exists a network of microtubules of various polarities underlying the cell surface and microtubule network in the cell bottom ( Waschke and Drenck(cid:2) hahn , 2000 ; Musch , 2004 ; Halbleib et al . , 2007 ) . They were discovered in cell lines derived from columnar epithelium , e . g . , MDCK and Caco2 cells . Some microtubules ( mostly in the above(cid:2)nuclear cytoplasmic area ) are radially positroned and extend from the Golgi complex to the apical membrane ( Suzaki et al . , 2004 ) . They are involved in mainte(cid:2) nance of the cell shape and keep the Golgi complex in the above(cid:2)nuclear region . Microtubules ensure protein vesicular transport . Mostly apical – basal microtubules are involved in this process . Exocytotic vesicles associated with microtu(cid:2) bule minus ends move toward the apical membrane , whereas endocytotic vesicles associated with microtu(cid:2) bule minus ends move toward the basolateral mem(cid:2) brane . Horizontally oriented microtubules also partic(cid:2) ipate in vesicular transport and basolateral exocytosis Interaction of Glucose Transporters SGLT1 and GLUT2 with Cytoskeleton in Enterocytes and Caco2 Cells during Hexose Absorption N .

Confocal microscopy revealed that the distribution of SGLT1 and GLUT2 transporters in absorptive cells of the intestinal villus was altered depending on maltose concentration . The transporters were colocal(cid:2) ized with actin . An increased number of vesicles close to microtubules in the apical cell part during absorption of high hexoze concentration was observed with electron microscopy . This observation , as well as uncovered colocalization of the transporters and actin , as well as actin and α (cid:2)tubulin , suggests that elements of the cytoskeleton participate in the translocation of glucose transporters to the apical cell membrane .

Microtubules , being a cytoskeleton element , are involved in the barrier function of the epithelium sheet by structural modifications of intercellular contacts . Disorders in tubulin phosphorylation in Caco2 cells altered microtubule structure and monolayer perme(cid:2) ability ( Banan et al . , 2004 ) . We ( Grefner et al . , 2006 , 2010 , 2012 ; Gromova et al . , 2006 ) and others ( see review Kellett et al . , 2008 ; Chaudhry et al . , 2012 ) have reported previously that the sugar absorption from the intestine lumen was accompanied with redistribution of glucose transport(cid:2) ers SGLT1 and GLUT2 in enterocytes from various parts of the intestinal villi . Transporter incidence in various cell areas occurs by protein synthesis de novo ( Gouyon et al . , 2003 ) , as well as by translocation of existing transporters inside the cells ( Khoursandi et al , 2004 ; Habold et al . , 2005 ; Suzuki et al . , 2006 ) . These processes can be considered to be correlated with microtubule reorganization and redistribution . In this paper , we described the localization of microtubules and glucose transporters SGLT1 or GLUT2 in enterocytes of the rat intestine and their model , Caco2 cells , loaded with sugar in various con(cid:2) centrations . MATERIALS AND METHODS Experiments were performed on male Wistar rats ( 180 – 200 g body mass ) . Maltose loading was done by perfusion of isolated intestinal loop in a chronic exper(cid:2) iment ( Ugolev and Zapipov , 1979 ) . The isolated loop was perfused with Ringer’s solution ( pH 7 . 1 – 7 . 4 ) or Ringer’s solution with maltose ( 12 . 5 and 50 mM ) , and the rats were sacrificed . Parts of the isolated loop were fixed with 2 % glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer ( PBS ) , postfixed with 1 % OsO 4 in the same buffer , dehydrated through increasing concentrations of eth(cid:2) anol up to complete , and embedded into epon – araldite mixture ( Mironov and Komissarchik , 1994 ) . Ultrathin sections prepared from polymerized blocks were sequentially contrasted for 10 min in lead citrate , uranyl acetate , and lead citrate . The sections were assayed under a Libra electron microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Germany ) . For confocal microscopy , parts of the intestinal loop were fixed with 2 % formaldehyde in PBS for 1 h , impregnated with 30 % sucrose as a cryoprotector , and frozen in isooctane cooled in liquid nitrogen . Samples were stored at – 30 ° C . Sections of 7 – 10 μ m were pre(cid:2) pared with a Leica microtome cryostat . Sugar trans(cid:2) porters on sections were identified with indirect immunolabeling . Sections were permeabilized with 0 . 3 % Triton X(cid:2)100 in PBS for 20 min . Unspecific immunoglobulin binding was blocked with 3 % BSA in 0 . 3 % Triton X(cid:2)100 / PBS for 1 h . Polyclonal goat anti(cid:2) bodies to SGLT1 ; rabbit antibodies to GLUT2 , dilu(cid:2) tion 1 : 500 ; and rabbit antibodies to α (cid:2)tubulin , dilu(cid:2) tion 1 : 250 , in 0 . 5 % BSA / 0 . 3 % Triton X(cid:2)100 / PBS ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc . , United States ) were used as primary antibodies . Samples were incu(cid:2) bated in primary antibodies overnight at 4 ° C and washed four times for 10 min in 0 . 5 % BSA / 0 . 3 % Tri(cid:2) ton X(cid:2)100 / PBS . Donkey antibodies to goat immuno(cid:2) globulin conjugated with ( Alexa(cid:2)633 ( Molecular Probes Inc . , United States ) and chicken antibodies to rabbit immunoglobulins conjugated with Alexa(cid:2)488 ( Molecular Probes Inc . , United States ) were used as secondary antibodies for SGLT1 and GLUT2 visual(cid:2) ization , respectively . Secondary antibodies were diluted 1 : 500 in 0 . 5 % BSA / 0 . 3 % Triton X(cid:2)100 / PBS . Samples were incubated with secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature and washed twice with PBS for 30 min . Fibrillar actin was visualized with rhodamine – phalloidin ( Molecular Probes Inc . , United States ) staining at a dilution of 1 : 100 in PBS for 30 min and washed with PBS four times . Stained sections were mounted in DABCO medium on slides . Preparations were analyzed with a Leica TCS SL con(cid:2) focal microscope ( Leica , Germany ) . Caco2 cells were obtained from the Vertebrates Cell Culture Collection ( Institute of Cytology , Russian Academy of Sciences , Russia ) . The cells were seeded on coverslips in Petri dishes or polyether membrane filters ( 0 . 4 μ m pore size ) in microplates in DMEM medium with 10 % fetal bovine serum . Petri dishes and microplates were kept in the incubator with 5 % CO 2 in atmosphere and at a temperature of 37 ° C . The medium was replaced every 2 days . The cells were used in experiments after 21 days . The incubation medium contained : 137 mM NaCl , 4 . 7 mM KCl , 1 . 2 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 1 . 2 mM MgSO 4 , 2 . 5 mM CaCL 2 , 10 mM buffer(cid:2)HEPES ( pH 7 . 2 ) , 4 mM glutamine , and 2 . 5 or 25 mM glucose . The cell monolayer was washed twice with 1 mL medium with(cid:2) out the substrate and once with 1 mL medium with the substrate and then incubated with 1 mL medium with substrate at 37 ° C for 1 h . After incubation , the medium was aspirated and the cells were fixed . For immunocytochemical assay , cells on coverslips were fixed with 2 % formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min . α (cid:2)tubulin immunolabeling was done as with intestinal sections . Samples were analyzed with a Leica TCS SL microscope . Electron microscopic study with cultured cells was done on cells grown on filters . The cells were fixed with 2 % glutaraldehyde for 30 min , postfixed with 1 % OsO 4 for 30 min , dehydrated , and embedded with fil(cid:2) ters into an epon – araldite mixture as described for intestinal fragments .

RESULTS Distribution of fibrillar actin . We have previously reported ( Grefner et al . , 2010 , 2012 ) that , in entero(cid:2) cytes and Caco2 cells , fibrillar actin was revealed along cell borders and microvillus . It is seen by confocal microscopy ( Fig . 1 ) that actin produces a rim along the intestinal villus perimeter . The same pattern of fibrillar actin distribution is observed in Caco2 cells ( Fig . 2 ) . The same actin allocation was found at the ultrastructural level ( Figs . 3 , 4 ) . Distribution of glucose transporters SGLT1 and GLUT2 . The distribution of glucose transporters SGLT1 and GLUT2 was studied with confocal microscopy in enterocytes of rats with an intestine loaded with maltose in various concentrations . Fig(cid:2) ures 1a – 1c show that SGLT1 labeling predominates in the enterocyte apical region ; in the area of the brush border , it is colocalized with actin . A colocalization area , mostly in the upper half of the intestinal villus , was observed in the intestine loaded with Ringer’s solution ( control ) and 12 . 5 mM maltose ( low dose ) . These areas are observed in the lower half of the villus in animals loaded with 50 mM maltose ( high dose ) . A GLUT2 transporter ( Figs . 1d – 1f ) with maltose loaded at a low dose has been identified both in the basal and apical cell areas and is colocalized with actin in the upper half of the intestinal villus . GLUT2 label(cid:2) ing is more intense in the enterocyte apical area and is colocalized with actin along the entire length of the intestinal villus after perfusion with 50 mM maltose . Distribution of α (cid:2)tubulin in enterocytes . α (cid:2)tubulin distribution in absorptive cells of the intestinal villus assayed with confocal microscopy is shown in Figs . 1g – 1i . It is seen that labeling is evident both in the api(cid:2) cal cell part and close to the basolateral membrane . Comparison of α (cid:2)tubulin labeling in different areas of the intestinal villus with various loads showed that , in control ( intestine perfusion with Ringer’s solution ) , labeling predominated in the upper part of the intesti(cid:2) nal villus . In enterocyte regions adjacent to the brush border , α (cid:2)tubulin is colocalized with actin . In entero(cid:2) cytes of intestine perfused with 12 . 5 mM maltose , α (cid:2) tubulin labeling is visualized along the entire length of the villus and is totally colocalized with actin . α (cid:2)tubu(cid:2) lin labeling prevailed on the villus top with maltose concentration increased up to 50 mM . Distribution of α (cid:2)tubulin in Caco2 cells . α (cid:2)tubulin distribution in Caco2 cells did not depend on the load ( control and incubation with 2 . 5 and 25 mM glucose ) . Figure 2 shows the location of α (cid:2)tubulin in cells incu(cid:2) bated with 2 . 5 mM glucose . It is seen that both apical and basal cell parts are labeled , although the fluores(cid:2) cence intensity is higher in apical and subapical areas . Close to the cellular border in the apical area , α (cid:2)tubu(cid:2) lin is localized with actin ; no colocalization with actin was observed in the basal cell part . Enterocyte ultrastructure . Enterocyte ultrastruc(cid:2) ture in control and at various loads is very similar . Numerous microvilli with root filaments submerged into the apical cytoplasm are seen in Fig . 3a . Figure 3a also shows that a junction complex composed of a tight junction , intermediate junction , and desmosome is formed between enterocytes . The enterocyte cytoplasm contains a great number of microtubules . Some of them located close to the microvilli root filament are oriented parallel to the apical membrane ( Fig . 3a ) . Intermediate fibrils paral(cid:2) lel to the apical membrane are adjacent to the desmo(cid:2) some in the area of the junction complex ( Fig . 3a ) . The cytoplasm has microtubules oriented along the apical – basal axis ( Fig . 3c ) , as well as perpendicular to the axis ( Fig . 3d ) . Sugar loading is accompanied by the appearance of numerous coated vesicles close to microtubules ( Figs . 3d , 3e ) . They are encountered most frequently in the apical cell part . Ultrastructure of Caco2 cells . We previously reported ( Grefner et al . , 2012 ) that Caco2 cells after 21 days in culture acquired features common for enterocytes . Figure 4 shows Caco2 cells grown on the polyether filters to the monolayer . Microvilli are formed on the apical cell part ( Figs . 4a , 4b ) , and a junction complex is seen between cellular lateral membranes ( Fig . 4f ) . Like enterocytes , Caco2 cells have microtubules oriented parallel to the apical membrane ( Fig . 4a ) , along the basal – apical axis ( Fig . 4b ) and parallel to the lateral membrane ( Fig . 4c ) . Many microtubules are located parallel to the basal membrane in these cells ( Fig . 4d ) . In cells cultured with 25 mM glucose , coated vesicles are seen close to the microtubules ( Fig . 4e ) . 48 CELL AND TISSUE BIOLOGY Vol . 9 No . 1 2015 GREFNER et al .

Our new data showed that GLUT2 transporter was present in the enterocyte apical area colocalized with brush border actin , but only in the upper half of the intestinal villus in cells after sugar absorption at a low dose and even in control . With an increased sugar dose , lower parts of the intestinal villus become involved : SGLT1 and GLUT2 transporters are revealed in enterocytes of the lower half of the villus , frequently being colocalized with brush border actin . However , it is still unclear how they occurred there— whether they moved from one cell part into another or were synthesized de novo and delivered into required sites . In both cases , the structural elements responsible for the transporter transfer are involved . Transporters can be considered to be relocated by endosomes asso(cid:2) ciated with microtubules . In this work , we showed the correlation between redistribution of sugar transport(cid:2) ers and cytoskeleton rearrangements in enterocytes and Caco2 cells . Maltose loading resulted in redistri(cid:2) bution of α (cid:2)tubulin similarly to that of glucose trans(cid:2) porter ; i . e . , during sugar absorption , it accumulated much more in the lower parts of the villus . These pro(cid:2) cesses are probably interrelated . Unlike in the case of enterocytes , no α (cid:2)tubulin redistribution was observed in Caco2 cells . However , α (cid:2)tubulin labeling was more intense in the apical cell part containing coated vesi(cid:2) cles , presumably with enclosed glucose transporters . This finding suggests microtubule implication in the transport of SGLT1 and GLUT2 . Our data coincide with the findings obtained by other researchers . It was shown that SGLT1 trans(cid:2) porter is associated with endosomes connected with microtubules ( Wright et al . , 1997 ; Kipp et al . , 2003 ; Khoursandi et al . , 2004 ) . Microtubule depolymeriza(cid:2) tion was accompanied with impaired SGLT1 transport ( Suzuki et al . , 2006 ) . Diminished SGLT1 content in the brush border and suppressed glucose absorption at the microtubule depolymerization with unaltered total SGLT1 expression ( Canania et al . , 2006 ) are evidence in favor of the existence of the hypothesized link between the transporter and microtubules . GLUT2 colocalized with early endosomes has been reported ( Ait(cid:2)Omar et al . , 2011 ) . Its activity was inhibited by nocodazole and cytochalasin , agents that disrupt microtubules ( Zheng and Sarr , 2012 ) . The endosomes and vesicles with GLUT4 transporter found in muscle cells suggest that similar vesicles may be present in other tissues and contain other glucose transporters . These vesicles are associated with microtubules ensur(cid:2) ing GLUT4 delivery to the apical membrane ( Bogan , 2012 ) . Moreover , it was shown that not only glucose transporters , but aquaporines as well , were enclosed in specific granules , transfer of which to the apical mem(cid:2) ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) mv cb n tub n tub cb 15 . 11 µ m 15 . 11 µ m Fig . 2 .

Actin filaments serve as a guide for vesicle transport ( Robertson et al . , 2009 ) . Apparently , both cytoskeleton components—microtubules and actin filaments—are involved in SGLT1 and GLUT2 trans(cid:2) port inside enterocytes .
