S1 ) . The slope in this display is sensitive to anomaly of diffusion : due to the relationship of log ( MSD / time ) (cid:2) ( (cid:3) – 1 ) log ( time ) ( 0 (cid:4) (cid:3) (cid:4) 1 ) , (cid:3) parametrizes the level of anomaly ( Saxton , M . J . 1994 . Biophys . J . 66 : 394 – 401 ; Saxton , M . J . 1996 . Biophys . J . 70 : 1250 – 1262 ; Feder , T . J . , I . Brust - Mascher , J . P . Slattery , B . Baird , and W . W . Webb . 1996 . Biophys . J . 70 : 2767 – 2773 ) . In the case of simple Brownian diffusion , the plot becomes flat ( (cid:3) – 1 (cid:2) 0 ) and (cid:3) (cid:2) 1 . When the diffusion is anomalous , (cid:3) becomes (cid:5) 1 , giving a negative slope ( (cid:3) – 1 (cid:5) 0 ) to the plot . For DOPE molecules undergoing free Brownian diffusion in LUVs ( Fig . S1 ) , the plot is almost flat between 100 (cid:1) s and 10 ms when observed at a 25 - (cid:1) s resolution . The best fit for the plot yields an (cid:3) of 0 . 97 ( (cid:1) 1 ) , which indicates that DOPE in LUVs is undergoing simple Brownian diffusion . On the other hand , the plot for the cell membrane exhibits multiple negative slopes depending on the observation time intervals . The plot can be fitted with three lines with (cid:3) s of 0 . 74 ( (cid:5) 12 ms ) , 0 . 55 ( 12 – 590 ms ) , and 0 . 79 ( (cid:6) 590 ms ) . The transitions were found to occur at 12 ms and 0 . 59 s , comparable to the residency times within 230 - nm ( 11 ms ) and 750 - nm ( 0 . 65 s ) compartments for DOPE hop diffusion , respectively . Therefore , we interpret this time dependence as a result of ( a ) DOPE being corralled inside 230 - nm compartments for an average of 11 ms while undergoing free diffusion inside the compartment , ( b ) DOPE being corralled inside 750 - nm compartments for an average of 0 . 65 s while undergoing hop movement among 230 - nm compartments ( because we are using the data for gold - tagged DOPE , the hop rate among 750 - nm compartments is 0 . 65 s rather than the 0 . 33 s estimated for Cy3 – DOPE ) , and ( c ) DOPE undergoing hop movement among 750 - nm compartments once every 0 . 65 s . Although anomalous diffusion in the cell membrane could be caused by various kinds of obstacles and binding sites ( Saxton , 1994 , 1996 ) , the good agreement of these transition times in Fig . S1 with the residency times ( 11 ms and 0 . 65 s ) supports the predominant involvement of double compartmentalization ( into 230 - and 750 - nm compartments ) in limiting the macroscopic diffusion rate of DOPE . Figure S1 . Plots of log ( MSD / time ) against log ( time ) provide useful information on the changes of diffusion characteristics that depend on the observation time intervals . MSD of the trajectories was estimated using data obtained at the time resolutions of 25 (cid:1) s ( 5 , 000 frames ; purple ) , 0 . 22 ms ( 5 , 000 frames ; blue ) , 2 ms ( 2 , 500 frames ; green ) , and 33 ms ( 500 frames ; orange ) for the time windows where theoretically expected statistical errors in MSD are (cid:5) 40 % ( Qian et al . , 1991 ) . Then the mean log ( MSD / time ) values ( circles ) and their standard deviations ( curves ) for each time resolution were plotted as a function of log ( time ) . The shorter ( log ( time ) (cid:5) (cid:7) 1 . 5 ) and the longer ( (cid:7) 1 . 5 (cid:5) log ( time ) ) periods contain 1 , 113 and 1 , 388 time points , respectively , which would give rather uniform weight over the entire time window when least square fitting is performed for these points as described below . Normal ( simple Brownian ) and anomalous diffusion can be distinguished in this display as having no time dependence ( slope (cid:1) 0 ) and having negative slopes , respectively ( Saxton , 1994 , 1996 ; Feder et al . , 1996 ) . The best fit on the data obtained for the cell membrane using the continuous three linear segments ( red solid line , representing three anomalous exponents ) gives transitions at 12 ms and 0 . 59 s . These three segments are consistent with ( a ) the confinement of freely diffusing DOPE within a 230 - nm compartment for an average of 11 ms , ( b ) the confinement of DOPE undergoing consecutive hops over 230 - nm compartments within a 750 - nm compartment for an average of 0 . 65 s , and ( c ) consecutive hop movement of DOPE over many 750 - nm compartments . The slope in the experimental data is shallower at the high time resolution end ( left end ) because at these time intervals , DOPE molecules that are not located near the compartment boundaries are undergoing simple Brownian diffusion . In addition , if we had employed lower resolution or longer time intervals of observation , the slope at the right end would have become shallower because DOPE molecules would have looked as if they were undergoing simple diffusion by hopping from one ( 750 nm ) compartment to another . For comparison , the plot for the trajectories in LUVs ( 2 , 250 frames ; n (cid:2) 17 ) and the best regression result ( red line , (cid:3) (cid:2) 0 . 97 ) are also shown .
