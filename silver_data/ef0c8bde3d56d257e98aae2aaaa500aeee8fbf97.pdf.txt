Received 10 May 2008 ; published 1 October 2008 " The details of conformational changes undergone by transmembrane ion channels in response to stimuli , such as electric ﬁelds and membrane tension , remain controversial . We approach this problem by considering how the conformational changes impose deformations in the lipid bilayer . We focus on the role of bilayer deformations in the context of voltage - gated channels because we hypothesize that such deformations are relevant in this case as well as for channels that are explicitly mechanosensitive . As a result of protein conformational changes , we predict that the lipid bilayer suffers deformations with a characteristic free - energy scale of 10 k B T . This free energy is comparable to the voltage - dependent part of the total gating energy , and we argue that these deformations could play an important role in the overall free - energy budget of gating . As a result , channel activity will depend upon mechanical membrane parameters such as tension and leaﬂet thick - ness . We further argue that the membrane deformation around any channel can be divided into three generic classes of deformation that exhibit different mechanosensitive properties . Finally , we provide the theoretical framework that relates conformational changes during gating to tension and leaﬂet thickness dependence in the critical gating voltage . This line of investigation suggests experiments that could discern the dominant defor - mation imposed upon the membrane as a result of channel gating , thus providing clues as to the channel deformation induced by the stimulus .

Its undulating and dynamic terrain is peppered with proteins regulating what enters and leaves the cell . Various classes of membrane proteins interact with different environmental sig - nals to determine when to allow molecular species such as ions to pass through the membrane . For example , voltage - gated ion channels are sensitive to millivolt - scale transmem - brane electric potentials and respond to these voltages by undergoing a conformational change that allows selected ions to pass . A growing body of work # 1 – 5 $ suggests that the proper - ties of the membrane inﬂuence the gating behavior of chan - nels . In other words , the bilayer is not a passive bystander in membrane - protein function . This is demonstrated in the con - text of mechanosensitive channels whose function is acutely sensitive to properties of the surrounding bilayer such as lipid tail length , spontaneous curvature , and tension # 2 , 6 , 7 $ . Previous theoretical work has focused on the observed con - nection between channel function and membrane elastic properties by examining membrane deformations at the protein - lipid interface # 8 – 14 $ . Sensitivity to membrane mechanical properties is not unique to mechanosensitive channels . Voltage - gated ion channels also demonstrate sensitivity to applied membrane tension # 3 , 4 , 15 – 17 $ and intrinsic elastic properties such as membrane stiffness , which has been shown to be correlated to deactivation of voltage - dependent sodium channels # 7 , 18 $ . Therefore it is well established that the physical properties of the membrane inﬂuence channel gating , and in this work we exploit the channel - membrane interaction in the hope of learning about the structural changes of the channel itself . Our models are “coarse - grained” in the sense that the channel - membrane interactions are represented by different classes of membrane boundary conditions that replace the complex details of atomic - level motions . An equivalent mindset that has proven useful for consid - ering the connection between ion - channel function and mem - brane properties is the use of the so - called lateral pressure proﬁle # 19 – 21 $ . These proﬁles have been shown to be related to stability of conformational states of membrane - bound pro - teins . In our work , we consider the complementary elastic - deformation models , in which we assume that the important contributions from the lateral pressure are accounted for in their lowest order moments , in the form of membrane param - eters such as bilayer and leaﬂet spontaneous curvature and tension . A . Structure and function of voltage - gated ion channels As an example of the type of problem this work ad - dresses , we consider voltage - gated ion channels as a case study . Although the crystal structure of the well studied Shaker family K + channel Kv1 . 2 is available in the open conformation # 22 $ , no voltage - gated channel structure has thus far been determined in both the closed and open confor - mations . The mechanism by which voltage - gated ion chan - nels open and close in response to changing electric poten - tials remains uncertain ; the goal of this paper is to explore * Author to whom correspondence should be addressed . dreeves @ brandeis . edu PHYSICAL REVIEW E 78 , 041901 ! 2008 " 1539 - 3755 / 2008 / 78 ! 4 " / 041901 ! 11 " ©2008 The American Physical Society 041901 - 1 the implications of different classes of structural models for membrane - protein interactions . The comparison is based on the channel’s sensitivity to bulk membrane mechanical prop - erties . All the channel mechanisms we explore contain two criti - cal features : a pore region responsible for selectively block - ing and passing ions across the membrane , and sensor re - gions that confer voltage sensitivity to the pore region . The voltage sensing motif is highly conserved across voltage - gated channels and consists of a bundle of four transmem - brane helices # 23 $ . At every third position on the fourth helix ! named S4 " there is a charged arginine or lysine residue that is responsible for voltage sensitivity # 24 – 26 $ . In Shaker fam - ily channels , for example , these charged residues contribute 12 positive elementary charges per tetrameric channel # 27 $ , or three for each subunit . The conformational change to the conducting state decreases the electrostatic potential energy of these charged residues by a mechanism that remains un - certain . The charges either move through the electric poten - tial or the channel manipulates and changes the electric ﬁeld around them . From the point of view of membrane deformations , the differences between the channel gating models are best de - scribed in terms of how the sensor regions move during opening and closing to modify the electrostatic environment of the charged residues . They may swing across the plane of the membrane as a paddle # 28 $ , or they may undergo a more subtle motion like a helical screw # 29 , 30 $ . Some models do not rely upon the sensor domain actively transporting the charges across the membrane , but rather propose that its mo - tion creates crevices that control how far the surrounding ionic solution penetrates into the protein , thus manipulating the electrostatic ﬁeld itself . For a thorough description of various gating models and comparisons to experimental re - sults , see Refs . # 23 , 29 , 31 $ . The energy associated with changing the electrostatic en - vironment of the residues is the voltage - dependent part of the gating energy , which we estimate using values for the Shaker family K + channels . Assuming simple two - state Boltzmann statistics in which all four channel subunits occupy the same state at any given time , the probability that a channel is in the open state is given by P open = 1 1 + e ! ! G tot / k B T " , ! 1 " where k B is Boltzmann’s constant and T is temperature . In the absence of deactivation , the conductance of the mem - brane is proportional to P open . We deﬁne ! G tot = G open − G closed , the total free energy difference between closed and open states . We can write ! G tot = ! G elec + ! G prot + ! G memb , where the terms represent the change in electrostatic gating energy , internal protein conformation free energy , and membrane - deformation free energy , respectively . We use a two - state model where “open” and “closed” describe the ac - tivation state of the pore . This is sufﬁcient provided the con - formations of the sensors and membrane are tightly corre - lated to that of the pore . Biological channels have many transition states which we assume have insigniﬁcant thermo - dynamic weight . Therefore the channel spends little time in those states , and we do not include them in our equilibrium model . The energies calculated below also inform the kinetics of opening and closing . The free energy barriers for the kinetic transitions include membrane deformation energies of the transient states . The kinetics will therefore inherit membrane - parameter dependence through the membrane de - formation energies . However , the many transition states may all have different transient membrane deformations , and ex - tracting the membrane - parameter dependence of any one transition would be difﬁcult . Equilibrium statistics , however , would not depend appreciably on these transient states . We estimate the electrostatic energy using experimental results . The transmembrane voltage at which P open = 0 . 5 is deﬁned as V 0 . 5 , where this half - activation voltage is typically negative and on the order of tens of millivolts . From Eq . ! 1 " , this voltage coincides with G open − G closed = 0 , implying that at V 0 . 5 the electrostatic gating energy , ! G elec , balances the sum of membrane deformation and protein free energies : ! G elec = − ! ! G memb + ! G prot " . In other words , the internal energies of the system balance the energy supplied by the external elec - tric ﬁeld . Direct measurements of gating current give the effective charge per channel as Q = 12 e o # 27 $ , where e o is one positive elementary charge ! i . e . , e o = 1 . 6 " 10 −19 C " . We esti - mate an upper bound on the total electrostatic gating energy as ! G elec = − QV 0 . 5 , assuming the charges move across the full potential . With V 0 . 5 = −35 mV as a typical transmembrane voltage at half activation for a potassium channel # 27 $ , one ﬁnds that ! G elec % 16 k B T . Therefore an upper bound on the combined membrane and protein contribution to the gating free energy that balances the electrostatic contribution is −16 k B T . For comparison , measurements of conductance - voltage curves for wild - type Shaker channels have yielded electrostatic gating energies of 4 – 6 k B T per channel # 32 , 33 $ . Kinetics measurements on potassium channels yield activa - tion energies of about 20 k B T per channel # 34 $ . Our calcu - lated upper bound will serve as a benchmark against which we will compare membrane energetic contributions . B . Conformation changes during gating To focus on how the channel protein causes membrane deformation , we consider a coarse - grained model in which the protein is an axially symmetric shape that dictates the lipid - protein interface and creates deformations in the mem - brane . As the channel switches between open and closed states the membrane deforms and relaxes . We consider three types of deformations , as described in Fig . 1 . Any small membrane deformation can be expressed as a combination of the three types . The deformed membrane may be associated with either the open or closed channel , so we commit to neither case and investigate both possibilities . A relaxed membrane , with no spontaneous curvature , lies ﬂat when undisturbed . The ﬁrst type of deformation , called midplane bending , bends the bilayer away from the relaxed planar conﬁguration . This deformation is induced by an ef - fective protein shape with sloped sides # Fig . 1 ! a " $ # 35 $ . Such a shape could arise from a noncylindrical protein structure , such as a truncated cone . The next type of deformation com - REEVES et al . PHYSICAL REVIEW E 78 , 041901 ! 2008 " 041901 - 2 presses or stretches the membrane leaﬂets from their equilib - rium thickness . This is referred to as compression deforma - tion and is induced by dictating a nonequilibrium bilayer thickness at the membrane - protein boundary # Fig . 1 ! b " $ . A difference in hydrophobic thickness between protein and lipid bilayer , called hydrophobic mismatch , causes this type of deformation # 11 , 36 $ . The last type of deformation accom - panies changes in the cross - sectional area of the protein . As the channel opens and closes , its areal footprint in the mem - brane may change , thus yielding to or pulling against the mechanical tension in the lipid bilayer . We refer to this as footprint dilation # Fig . 1 ! c " $ . These three scenarios make the implicit assumption that the membrane shape is enslaved to the protein conformation . Although not mandatory , it is clear that some amount of frustration accompanied by an energy cost will result from a mismatch between the protein confor - mation and the natural lipid order . Our assumptions frame the simplest way to investigate the effect of this frustration on the channel activity . C . Modeling strategy The effective protein shape is , in principle , related to the atomistic details of the protein . It is determined by the ge - ometry of the protein boundary and the locations and orien - tations of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues . How - ever , the atomistic detail of the protein in the closed state is one of the unresolved issues , and we therefore avoid those details . Instead , we focus exclusively on the membrane de - formations outlined in Fig . 1 and ask ! i " which deformation types contribute an energy that is relevant in the total free energy budget ? and ! ii " how does gating couple to membrane parameters ? We will demonstrate that those parameters which can be tuned experimentally , such as mechanical bi - layer tension and thickness , can be used as tools to determine if there is a dominant mode of deformation during gating . Such a coarse - grained approach to investigating lipid - protein interactions has clear advantages over atomistic ap - proaches , such as simplicity , broad applicability to a wide range of systems , and the ability to classify proteins based upon a generic shape deformation . However , such an ap - proach has natural limitations as well . Elastic theory may poorly describe membrane mechanics at short length scales , and in this analysis , we do not probe noncircularly symmet - ric deformations . Furthermore , we assume only one deforma - tion type is signiﬁcant . If multiple types exist and the ener - getic contributions are comparable , the deformations would be difﬁcult to identify . This work is a starting point , and to obtain detailed descriptions of gating for speciﬁc proteins , it must be supplemented with other data from structural studies and simulations . Thus far , we have proposed a simple model of the protein . In Sec . II we model the bilayer as a continuous elastic sheet and describe deformations in terms of functions giving the height and thickness of the bilayer . This formulation allows us to concentrate on estimating the energy while discarding the details of individual lipids and their interactions . Section II A discusses the energy functionals for the deformations . In Sec . III we utilize analytic methods to ﬁnd the deformation proﬁles that minimize the energy functionals subject to the boundary conditions imposed by the protein shapes in each deformation type . We then use these results and membrane - parameter values from the literature to compute equilibrium energies . Section IV interprets these results in terms of membrane - parameter dependence in V 0 . 5 , and makes predic - tions for a new set of experiments . II . ELASTIC PROPERTIES OF MEMBRANES Utilizing well - developed models of membrane elasticity , we ﬁnd the deformation energies by treating the bilayer as a ﬂuid elastic sheet # 8 , 9 , 37 , 38 $ . The local shape of the mem - brane can be characterized by two unique functions , one de - scribing the membrane thickness and one the midplane height or deviation from a ﬂat reference plane . We assume the protein has axial symmetry and work in cylindrical coor - dinates where r is the distance from the center of the channel ! Fig . 2 " . We also assume that the membrane deformations are sufﬁciently small , i . e . , the derivatives in the midplane slope and compression are small , so that all energies can be ex - pressed at their lowest ! quadratic " order . In midplane - bending deformations , h ! r " is the deviation of the bilayer midplane from the ﬂat reference plane . The protein shape ﬁxes the slope of the membrane midplane at the membrane - protein interface . Therefore in our small - deformation approximation , the boundary condition is & ! h ! r & r = R = −tan ! # " ’ − # , where R is the radius of the protein and # is the angle formed by the midplane with the perpen - dicular at the protein - lipid interface . For compression defor - mations , u ! r " is the compression of each leaﬂet from the reference thickness d o , the equilibrium hydrophobic thick - ness at zero tension far from the protein # Fig . 2 ! b " $ . Positive values of u indicate leaﬂet compression for which the leaﬂet is thinner than d o , whereas negative values indicate leaﬂet extension , where the leaﬂet is thicker than d o . In compres - sion deformations , the protein ﬁxes the thickness of the membrane along its edge , imposing the boundary condition u ! R " = U o . Footprint dilations are characterized by the protein radius R , which can vary between the open and closed states . A .

Each functional includes contributions from different free energy sources , which are illustrated schematically in Fig . 3 . Deviations from the equi - librium area per lipid , lipid tilt ! relative to the midplane " , and leaﬂet thickness all cost free energy . In Sec . III we solve for the shape functions h ! r " and u ! r " that minimize the free en - ergy . Elastic moduli measured in bulk membranes may not ac - curately describe the small - scale deformations along the protein - lipid interface . When packed against a protein , indi - vidual lipids lose degrees of freedom and therefore the free energy of the lipids depend upon their proximity to the pro - tein . There are various ways to model this effect in terms of membrane deformations . These include utilizing radially de - pendent elastic moduli # 39 $ , adding an additional line energy term along the protein # 40 , 41 $ , or ﬁxing the interface angle produced between the protein and the lipids # 11 $ . These tech - niques can be tuned to give similar behavior # 39 $ . Given that in this work we are most interested in an estimate of the magnitude of the deformation energy and how the free en - ergy scales with the parameters , we choose the last technique for its simplicity . The ﬁrst type of deformation , midplane bending , has en - ergy contributions from bending the bilayer and from the addition of membrane area due to the bending . We write the free energy as G bend = ! M ! d 2 r ! b 2 " 2 C mean − C ob # 2 bending + " # A area change , ! 2 " where the integral is over the deformed membrane surface M ! , $ is the applied bilayer tension , and ! A is the total bilayer area change due to the deformation . We deﬁne the free energy of an undeformed membrane # i . e . , h ! r " = 0 $ , with no spontaneous curvature , as zero . The ﬁrst term represents energy of curvature , where % b is the elastic curvature modu - lus of the bilayer . The energy depends upon the difference between the mean curvature C mean , and the spontaneous cur - vature of the bilayer , C ob . To simplify calculations and analy - sis , we assume that the two leaﬂets of the bilayer are com - positionally similar in which case C ob vanishes . Whereas this can be the case in pure artiﬁcial bilayers , biological systems and some artiﬁcial bilayers possess compositional asymme - try which leads to a nonzero C ob # 42 , 43 $ . The second term represents the work done against mechanical tension when the bilayer area is modiﬁed . The change in area , ! A , origi - nates from a sloped midplane which has more area than a ﬂat membrane with the same projection . Tension in artiﬁcial lipid bilayers is controlled by factors such as a pressure dif - ference across the bilayer , the geometry of the bilayer and the material interfaces along the bilayer boundary , whereas the membrane tension of cells is thought to be regulated # 44 $ . We use a single tension that is constant across the bilayer , because to a good approximation a simple bilayer acts as a two dimensional ﬂuid with no shear stresses . This approxi - mation breaks down in more complex systems such as a crowded membrane with structures of varying mobility .

ENERGIES OF EQUILIBRIUM MEMBRANE PROFILES In the previous section we presented the free energies associated with deformed membranes characterized by the shape functions h ! r " and u ! r " . At equilibrium , the membrane will adopt a proﬁle that minimizes the free energy and satis - ﬁes the boundary conditions imposed by the embedded pro - tein . The different protein conformations impose different boundary conditions , and therefore each conformation is as - sociated with a unique proﬁle and free energy . In this section , we calculate the free energy costs for the three types of de - formation and examine how these free energies might differ between the open and closed states . The energy costs will depend upon the membrane param - eters that appear in each functional . To compare the calcu - lated deformation energies with phenomenological gating en - ergies , we construct a reference membrane by choosing a value for each model parameter .

The choice of a “typi - cal” value , however , depends heavily upon the context . For example , the tension in a bilayer patch sealed against the inside of a pipette ! as in a patch - clamp setup " could be very different from the tension in a living cell’s membrane . In the former , the tension is determined by external forces and the geometry of the glass - bilayer interface # 6 , 47 $ , and is on the order of 1 k B T / nm 2 ! equivalent to 4 mN / m " # 11 $ . In the lat - ter , the tension is determined by a combination of cytoskel - etal and exoskeletal structures , geometry , and osmotic pres - sure across the membrane # 48 , 49 $ . Tensions in isolated plant membranes have been measured to be % 0 . 03 k B T / nm 2 # 50 $ , whereas membrane tether force experiments give resting ten - sions in molluscan neurons an order of magnitude lower # 51 $ . Vesicle micropipette aspiration techniques , in which suction is applied by a micropipette against a lipid vesicle , can tune and measure tensions of 3 " 10 −4 – 3 k B T / nm 2 . Note that the upper range is close to lytic tension for most lipid bilayers # 52 $ . We choose 0 . 3 k B T / nm 2 , or roughly 1 . 2 mN / m , as a reference tension for its applicability to experimental situations . As discussed above , we choose the interfacial sur - face tension between solvent and lipid as a lower estimate for % gr . We expect % c to be at most one - half the bilayer bending modulus % b . These reference values will provide estimates of the deformation energy . For further discussion of the values chosen , see the references cited in the table , and for an ex - tended discussion of the range of these values , we direct the reader to # 53 , 54 $ . A . Midplane bending The free energy functional in Eq . ! 3 " is minimized with respect to h ! r " , subject to the boundary conditions & ! h ! r " / ! r & r = R = − # , and h ! r → ’ " = 0 . The minimization prob - lem and the resultant free energies are solved in Appendix A and in # 8 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 14 $ . The solutions for h ! r " are Bessel func - tions with a tension dependent characteristic decay length of ( = - % b / $ % 8 nm . The minimizing free energy is G bend = % b ) # 2 * R ( + K 0 ! R / ( " K 1 ! R / ( " , ! 8 " where K n is the modiﬁed Bessel function of the second kind of order n . We estimate the free - energy difference between open and closed states using the parameter values in Table I and as - suming a range of small deformations at the protein bound - ary of 0 . 1 * # * 0 . 5 . The upper end of this range is consistent with structural models for the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscS # 56 $ . The free - energy difference between the deformed and undeformed ! # = 0 " states is ! G bend = G ! # = 0 " − G ! # " which adopts values ranging from −1 to −30 k B T for our reference membrane , a range comparable to our electro - static benchmark energy . B . Compression deformation Next we turn to the case of compression deformations and minimize the energy given by Eq . ! 6 " with respect to the compression proﬁle u˜ ! r " , subject to two boundary conditions . In addition to the condition u˜ ! R " = U˜ o , we set & ! u˜ ! r & r = R = 0 . As discussed in Sec . II A , we ﬁx the slope of the leaﬂets at the inclusion to model the packing of the lipids against the pro - tein . This simpliﬁes the problem and the mathematics while maintaining the essential parameter dependences and energy scales . In gramicidin , for example , the choice of zero slope predicts the correct channel lifetimes # 38 $ . Furthermore , the zero - slope boundary condition yields a free energy that does not depend upon the spontaneous curvature , C o # 12 , 14 $ . As expected from the axial symmetry , the minimizing function u˜ ! r " is of the form u˜ ! r " = U˜ o f ! r " , where f ! r " is a combination of Bessel functions given in Appendix B , and U˜ o is the compression at the boundary after tension rescaling . As shown in Appendix B ! similar calculations are given in # 8 , 11 , 14 , 38 , 57 , 58 $ " , the minimizing free energy for both leaf - lets is given by G comp = + U˜ o2 , where + % 700 k B T / nm 2 , as - suming the parameters in Table I . Therefore the free energy G comp inherits the tension dependence of U˜ o explicit in Eq . ! 5 " resulting in G comp = + * U o − d o $ 2 % e + 2 . ! 9 " Note that a protein - lipid interface for which U o = 0 yields a nonzero energy at nonzero tension . This result stems from the applied tension creating a deformation at the protein - lipid interface by thinning the bulk of the membrane . We write the difference in energy per leaﬂet between deformed and unde - formed states as ! G comp = G comp ! 0 " − G comp ! U o " = + * U o d o $ % e − U o2 + , ! 10 " where one state does not deform the membrane at zero ten - sion and we have assumed that the radius of the channel is constant . We ﬁnd that the free - energy difference between deformed and undeformed states is linear in bilayer tension $ . Note that if U o is positive , there exists a tension $ for which the “deformed” state has zero free energy . The bilayer thins sufﬁciently so its thickness in the bulk matches that at the protein interface . We use the above equations to evaluate ! G comp for our reference membrane and ﬁnd a typical value of roughly −14 k B T . Given the previous discussion , the leaﬂet slope at the boundary u ! ! R " may be nonzero . In that case , there is an additional free energy term proportional to the leaﬂet bend - ing modulus and the spontaneous curvature C o # 11 , 14 $ . Spontaneous curvatures of DOPE / DOPS mixtures in the H . hexagonal lattice phase have been measured to be between −0 . 3 and 0 . 07 nm −1 depending on the mixture # 59 , 60 $ . Given a small incident slope of u ! ! R " = 0 . 1 , we make a free energy estimate of 4 k B T for a mixed composition leaﬂet of nominal C o = 0 . 13 nm −1 . This term could account for the observed channel activity dependence on spontaneous curvature # 7 , 18 , 57 $ . REEVES et al . PHYSICAL REVIEW E 78 , 041901 ! 2008 " 041901 - 6 C . Footprint dilation The free energy associated with the channel area is found by simply substituting the area into Eq . ! 7 " . Again , we are interested only in the free - energy difference between open and closed states , which is ! G pore = $ ) ! R closed2 − R 2 " . ! 11 " R closed is the unknown radius of the channel in the closed conformation . Assuming a small 5 % decrease from the open state radius the corresponding free - energy change is −2 . 3 k B T . In general the radius could increase upon closing , giving a closed state with higher free energy . In the analysis of midplane and thickness deformations , we assume the radius of the channel R is held constant . How - ever , under footprint dilations the energetic contributions from midplane and thickness deformations increase with the circumference , even if those deformations are constant throughout the gating ! i . e . , U o and # are not state dependent " . The deformations induce a line tension along the circumfer - ence resisting the dilation . This is precisely the mechanism studied in mechanosensitive channels such as MscL and MscS # 2 , 56 $ . This implies that the footprint dilation mode inherits membrane - parameter dependence from state inde - pendent membrane deformations ! those deformations that do not change as the channel opens and closes " . Equation ! 11 " must be modiﬁed to account for this additional energy . Midplane deformations and compression deformations impose line tensions F bend and F comp , respectively . These are dependent upon both membrane parameters and channel ra - dius . However , assuming the change in radius during gating is small , we neglect the radial dependence and approximate the line tensions as constant during dilation . Adding the ad - ditional terms to Eq . ! 11 " gives a total energy shift between dilation states of ! G pore = $ ) ! R closed 2 − R 2 " + 2 ) ! R closed − R " ! F bend + F comp " . ! 12 " For the model membrane parameters and a change in radius of 5 % , we estimate the total free energy change to now be −2 . 9 k B T . With the additional terms , ! G pore is no longer strictly linear in tension . It inherits the quadratic dependence of Eq . ! 9 " and the square root dependence of Eq . ! 8 " . How - ever , this effect is small , and the energy remains linear in $ to a good approximation ! see Fig . 5 " . IV . IMPLICATIONS FOR CHANNEL GATING A . V 0 . 5 is a function of membrane energy Electrophysiological experiments performed on voltage - gated ion channels typically measure the transmembrane cur - rent as a function of transmembrane voltage , and thus mea - sure the conductivity of the composite membrane - protein system . If the channels are sufﬁciently dilute in the mem - brane , we ignore any possible cooperativity or frustration between channels and use the two - state Boltzmann statistics of Eq . ! 1 " . In the preceding section , we showed that our benchmark gating energy of 16 k B T is comparable to the magnitude of the membrane deformation energies alone . Therefore the sample membrane deformations considered ! % 10 % change in area or hydrophobic mismatch , or # % 0 . 3 " are energeti - cally relevant when compared to electrostatic and protein conformation contributions . Therefore the voltage at half ac - tivation , V 0 . 5 , ! ! G memb + ! G prot " , is sensitive to the mem - brane deformation energy . We can probe the sensitivity by measuring a shift in V 0 . 5 in response to a shift in applied tension , ! V 0 . 5 ! $ 0 , $ 1 " = V 0 . 5 ! $ 1 " − V 0 . 5 ! $ 0 " = 1 Q # ! G memb ! $ 0 " − ! G memb ! $ 1 " $ , ! 13 " where $ 0 and $ 1 are experimentally determined initial and shifted values of membrane tension , respectively . B . Membrane parameters are probes of the relevant deformations In Sec . III we showed that membrane energy varies with bilayer tension differently for different deformation types . Above , we argue that V 0 . 5 is sensitive to membrane tension . Experiments can probe this dependence to distinguish which deformation types of the three may be dominant during gat - ing . Figures 5 ! a " and 5 ! b " give expected shifts in V 0 . 5 as a function of applied membrane tension . To generate these plots , we use reference - membrane parameters and the ana - lytic solutions of Sec . III . The upper plot a assumes closed channels deform the membrane and open channels leave the membrane undisturbed , whereas the lower plot b assumes the converse . Experiments such as those described in # 15 – 17 $ have demonstrated tension dependence in peak current by induc - ing pressure across the membrane . The results suggest that increasing the stretch of the membrane , and therefore the tension , increases the open channel probability . These papers explore stretch dependence in activation and deactivation ki - netics , which , as discussed above , could involve membrane deformation . Unfortunately , the current literature does not yield quantitative measurements of tension , so establishing accurate relationships between tension and V 0 . 5 is not pos - sible with available data . Furthermore , the analysis we sug - gest requires channel conductivity without the interference of deactivation , as can be derived from time traces of the cur - rent # 17 $ . To calculate tension from the measured pressure , the patch clamp technique utilized in the experiments # 15 – 17 $ must be combined with measurements of the geom - etry of the membrane and the membrane - pipette interface # 2 , 61 – 63 $ . Unfortunately , as noted in # 17 $ , visualization of the interface is very difﬁcult given physical limitations on the pipette and hardware . Nevertheless , using a comparison between observed rup - ture pressures on the order of 100 mmHg and rupture ten - sions of about 4 k B T / nm 2 # 64 $ , the study by Morris and Ju - ranka demonstrates that tensions on the order of 0 . 4 k B T / nm 2 are consistent with shifts in V 0 . 5 of 2 – 3 mV in voltage - gated sodium channels . These measurements are smaller than the voltage shifts calculated for our model membrane system MEMBRANE MECHANICS AS A PROBE OF ION - CHANNEL … PHYSICAL REVIEW E 78 , 041901 ! 2008 " 041901 - 7 ! see Fig . 5 " , and perhaps correspond to smaller deformations . The above discussion centers on tension dependence in the gating free energy . The energy also depends upon mate - rial membrane parameters , such as leaﬂet thickness and bending modulus . These parameters are not independent but rather interrelated . For example , the ratio of bending modu - lus to stretch modulus is observed to vary quadratically with leaﬂet thickness # 52 $ . Therefore , in addition to inﬂuencing compression deformations , variations in leaﬂet thickness in - ﬂuence midplane - bending deformations via k b # 14 $ as well as footprint dilations via F bend and F comp . Over a range of hy - drophobic thickness from 1 . 2 to 1 . 7 nm , Rawicz and coau - thors ﬁnd that % e changes by less than 10 % whereas % b changes by over 100 % . We ignore changes in % e and let the bending modulus scale as % b ! = % b ! d o ! / d o " 2 where the prime indicates the value for modiﬁed thickness ! the compression - mode leaﬂet bending modulus % c scales identically " . In this way we calculate expected critical voltage shifts as a func - tion of bilayer thickness for each deformation type , and plot them in Figs . 5 ! c " and 5 ! d " . V . CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK We have argued that the lipid membrane is not a passive bystander in the functioning of ion channels . The membrane envelopes the channel , and as such , is intimately coupled to conformational changes of the channel protein . In the case of voltage - gated ion channels , the role and location of the S4 helix in the protein structure and evidence that the helix moves during gating # 65 $ implies protein motion at the protein - lipid interface . It follows that the conformation change during opening must induce local deformations in the lipid membrane . To change conformation , the channel must pay the energetic cost of bending and compressing the bi - layer . −50 0 50 100 150 ( ) ( m V ) - 4 - 2 0 2 4 a ) b ) c ) d ) −100 −50 0 50 100 ( m V ) footprint dilation bending compression footprint dilation compression bending 1 . 2 1 . 3 1 . 4 1 . 5 1 . 6 1 . 7 1 . 2 1 . 3 1 . 4 1 . 5 1 . 6 1 . 7 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 - 4 - 2 0 2 4 leaflet thickness ( nm ) FIG . 5 .

V 0 . 5 is expressed as a shift from V 0 . 5 at the reference tension and thickness in mV .

Plots ! a " and ! c " assume the closed channel state deforms the bilayer , whereas ! b " and ! d " assume the open channel deforms the bilayer . We present our results as though one type of deformation were dominant , though a physiological system may lack a dominant deformation type , existing as a mixture of different types . REEVES et al . PHYSICAL REVIEW E 78 , 041901 ! 2008 " 041901 - 8 Our estimates above place the cost of membrane deforma - tions on the order of 10 k B T for the representative deforma - tions , in agreement with other theoretical estimates # 19 – 21 $ . This is comparable to experimental estimates of total ener - gies that drive the gating . As a result , we claim that the energetics of membrane deformations should not be ignored . Furthermore , the membrane’s inﬂuence upon gating can be exploited to learn about the channel conformational change . Varying the applied bilayer tension and leaﬂet thickness modiﬁes gating energetics which are observable through open channel statistics . This suggests a class of experiments in which the half activation voltage is measured as a function of those membrane parameters : ! i " The model predicts a systematic shift in half activation voltage with applied tension . A square - root dependence indi - cates midplane deformation is dominant , whereas a linear shift indicates footprint dilation or bilayer compression is dominant . The sign of the slope indicates whether the open or closed conformation deforms the membrane . ! ii " The model also predicts a shift in half activation volt - age with lipid tail length . Supplemented with the understand - ing of how the elastic moduli depend upon the lipid tail length , the model distinguishes among deformation types based upon how the half activation voltage shifts with tail length . Bending deformations are least sensitive to leaﬂet thickness , whereas compression deformations are very sensi - tive and exhibit the most nonlinear dependence . This line of investigation could therefore place constraints on how the protein conformation changes during gating . By tuning membrane parameters , we can exploit the information stored in the membrane’s deformation and probe the protein itself .

APPENDIX A : MIDPLANE - BENDING EQUILIBRIUM SOLUTIONS To ﬁnd the equilibrium solutions for the bilayer proﬁle under midplane - bending deformations , we begin by writing the bending energy functional of Eq . ! 3 " in dimensionless units .
