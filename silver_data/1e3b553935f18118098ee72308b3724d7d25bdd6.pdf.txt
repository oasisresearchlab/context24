Amann and Thomas D .

When activated by binding to actin filaments and to the WA domain of Wiskott – Aldrich - syndrome protein ( WASP ) / Scar proteins , the Arp2 / 3 complex nucleates new filaments that grow from their barbed ends 4 – 8 . The Arp2 / 3 complex binds to the sides 9 and pointed ends 10 , 11 of actin filaments , local - izes to distinctive 70 (cid:176) actin - filament branches present in lamellae 12 , and forms similar branches in vitro 6 , 8 , 10 . These observations have given rise to the dendritic nucleation model for actin - network assembly 10 , 13 , in which the Arp2 / 3 complex initiates branches on the sides of older filaments . Recently , however , an alternative mechanism for branch formation has been proposed 8 . In the ‘barbed - end nucleation’ model , the Arp2 / 3 complex binds to the free barbed end of a filament and two filaments subse - quently grow from the branch . Here we report the use of kinetic and microscopic experiments to distinguish between these models . Our results indicate that the acti - vated Arp2 / 3 complex preferentially nucleates filament branches directly on the sides of pre - existing filaments . W e used light microscopy to examine filaments in samples obtained at intervals from bulk polymerization reactions , to distinguish side branching from barbed - end branching . The morphology of the products reveals much about the mechanism of branch formation . Fluorescent phalloidins can be used to stabilize and visualize the filaments 6 . Phalloidin also inhibits phosphate release after ATP hydrolysis . Thus , filaments stained with phal - loidin during polymerization contain ADP and inorganic phos - phate ( ADP – P i ) , whereas filaments stained with phalloidin at time points after polymerization contain ADP . We measured the lengths of branches formed during sponta - neous polymerization of monomeric actin in the presence of acti - vated Arp2 / 3 complex and rhodamine – phalloidin . The barbed ends of both daughter 6 and mother 10 filaments extended from the acute angle of the branch formed by the Arp2 / 3 complex . If branches arise from Arp2 / 3 complex bound to the barbed ends of filaments , and if the two branches are initiated simultaneously and elongate at equal rates , they should have similar lengths . On the other hand , if branches emanate from the sides of filaments , the lengths of the two filaments distal to the branch would not be cor - related . The reaction produced branched structures ( Fig . 1a ) in which the lengths of mother and daughter filaments distal to the branch were very poorly correlated ( Fig . 1b – d ) . The correlation coeffi - cients of the lengths of mother and daughter filaments produced by either amoebic ( Fig . 1b , d ) or bovine ( Fig . 1c , e ) Arp2 / 3 complex were 0 . 033 ( n = 104 ) and 0 . 217 ( n = 83 ) , respectively . Daughter fil - aments formed by both amoebic and bovine Arp2 / 3 complex were , on average , half as long as their mother filaments ( 1 . 6 m m com - pared with 3 . 4 m m , n = 183 ) , as measured distal to the branch . Over 80 % of filaments had one or more branches which varied in length relative to the mother . Some daughter filaments gave rise to further ‘generations’ of filaments ( Fig . 1a ) . To rule out the effects of phalloidin on branching and of anneal - ing of short filaments , we polymerized actin monomers with bovine Arp2 / 3 complex and the Scar WA domain ( Scar - WA ) , adding rhodamine – phalloidin only after the polymerization reac - tion was ~ 80 % complete . Dilution of the sample into fluorescence buffer after 2 min minimized filament annealing . The products were very similar to those assembled in the presence of phalloidin . Of filaments distal to 265 branches , daughter filaments were 1 . 12 – 0 . 61 m m in length and mother filaments were 2 . 55 – 1 . 78 m m long . The average ratio of daughter - to mother - filament length was 0 . 37 , and the correlation coefficient was only 0 . 068 . These results indicate that daughter branches may initiate from a point proximal to the barbed end of the mother filament . This contrasts with previous results 8 , which indicated a strong correla - tion of branch lengths , as measured by electron microscopy of fila - ments polymerized with the Arp2 / 3 complex and N - WASP . Specimen preparation may account for this difference . Hydrated filaments imaged by light microscopy are consistently longer than those prepared for electron microscopy ( reviewed in ref . 14 ) , prob - ably as a result of filament breakage , whereas lengths measured by light microscopy are similar to those determined in polymerization assays 14 . To distinguish further between the two filament - nucleation hypotheses , we determined the effect of barbed - end capping on the ability of filaments to serve as secondary activators of nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex . Secondary activation by filaments reduces the lag at the outset of polymerization of actin monomers with the Arp2 / 3 complex and the WA domain 4 – 6 , 8 . For example , 10 nM Arp2 / 3 complex activated with Scar - WA accelerated polymeriza - tion of 2 m M actin monomers , but only after a lag of ~ 300 s were 10 % of the monomers polymerized ( Fig . 2 ) . As little as 10 nM polymerized actin reduced this lag time to 210 s , whereas 40 nM and 200 nM polymerized actin further reduced the lag to 120 s and 50 s , respectively . The barbed - end - nucleation hypothesis requires the presence of free barbed ends for this secondary activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex . We found that short filaments capped on their barbed ends with capping protein stimulated nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex and the WA domain just as well as much longer , uncapped filaments ( Fig . 2 ) . Although the concentration of free capping protein was low , we included profilin to inhibit pointed - end elongation of fila - ments nucleated by free capping protein . The reduction in the lag time depended only on the mass of actin filaments added , and the © 2001 Macmillan Magazines Ltd brief communications NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOL 3 MARCH 2001 http : / / cellbio . nature . com 307 observed rate of polymerization ( see ref . 5 for the method of calcu - lation ) indicated that short , capped filaments generated the same concentration of new barbed ends as uncapped long filaments . This result is inconsistent with Arp2 / 3 complex binding to and nucleat - ing from the barbed ends of filaments . Similar data have been presented previously 8 , as the result of an experiment designed to examine the ability of the Arp2 / 3 complex activated by the WA domain to block polymerization at the point - ed ends of filaments capped on their barbed ends with gelsolin . Actin polymerized rapidly in the presence of gelsolin - capped fila - ments and a range of concentrations of the Arp2 / 3 complex . These findings have been interpreted as reflecting a failure of the Arp2 / 3 complex to cap pointed ends , followed by barbed - end branching from spontaneously formed nuclei . Given the low concentration of actin monomer and the absence of a significant lag in the time courses determined in this earlier study , we propse that a better interpretation is that gelsolin - capped filaments stimulated nucle - ation of branches that grew in the barbed direction . This vigorous barbed - end growth would have prevented inhibition of pointed - end growth by the Arp2 / 3 complex from being observed . We con - firmed both of these interpretations by light microscopy ( see below ) . Our third test of the two hypotheses involved imaging branches grown directly from pre - existing , marked filaments with either free or capped barbed ends ( Figs 3 , 4 ) . In the first of these experiments , we polymerized ATP – actin with Alexa 488 – phalloidin . We used the resulting green - stained mother filaments containing ADP – P i , together with the Arp2 / 3 complex and Scar - WA , to stimulate nucle - ation of actin monomers in the presence of rhodamine – phalloidin . New red filaments ( ~ 35 % of branches ) grew as branches on the sides of pre - existing green filaments ( Fig . 3 ) . Five per cent of red branches grew from the sides of red filaments that had grown from either the free barbed end or from the side of an original green fila - ment . Fifty per cent of red filaments ( n = 100 ) were not associated with a green filament as a result of nucleation in solution by the Arp2 / 3 complex or of spontaneous nucleation favoured by phal - loidin . Sixty per cent of red branches grew from the sides of these new red filaments . Per unit length of mother filament , the frequen - cy of branching from red and green filaments was similar — 1 branch per 14 m m of green filament ( n = 16 ) and 1 for every 13 . 5 m m of red filament ( n = 44 ) . As green filaments were present from the outset of the reaction , this indicates a slight bias towards branch - ing from new filaments . Transiently , the new filaments have ATP as the bound nucleotide and no bound phalloidin , but this is subject to rapid change , as the half time for ATP hydrolysis is only 2 s ( L . Blanchoin and T . D . P . , manuscript in preparation ) and the half time N u m be r Mean = 0 . 81 – 0 . 91 n = 104 N u m be r Mean = 0 . 65 – 0 . 75 n = 79 Mother - filament length ( m m ) Amoeba Daughter / mother length ratio Amoeba Mother - filament length ( m m ) Bovine Daughter / mother length ratio Bovine Correlationcoefficient : 0 . 033 Correlationcoefficient : 0 . 217 D augh t e r - f il a m en t l eng t h ( m m ) D augh t e r - f il a m en t l eng t h ( m m ) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 5 10 15 20 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 2 4 6 8 10 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 3 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 2 . 5 3 b a c d e Figure 1 Length distribution of actin filament branches mediated by the Arp2 / 3 complex . a , Fluorescence micrograph of a field of products of polymer - ization of 4 m M actin with 20 nM amoeba Arp2 / 3 complex , 200 nM Scar - WA and 4 m M rhodamine – phalloidin ( see Methods ) .

The lengths of polymer distal to branches varied widely between moth - er and daughter filaments . Some daughters and mothers ( Fig . 3b , c , e ) were of similar lengths , but most daughter filaments were signif - icantly shorter than their mothers ( Fig . 3a , d , e ) . In a second microscopy experiment , we capped green - labelled , ADP - containing mother filaments on their barbed ends with an excess of capping protein and used them to stimulate branching by WA – Arp2 / 3 complex in the presence of rhodamine – phalloidin to label new filaments and to stabilize branches by inhibiting phos - phate dissociation ( Fig . 4b – j ) . The products were similar to those in the experiment with uncapped mother filaments , except for the lack for red growth on the barbed ends of most green mother filaments , which verified that capping was effective . One or more red branch - es emanated from the sides of capped , phalloidin - stabilized green filaments and occasionally from red filaments ( Fig . 4g ) . New red fil - aments were shorter and less variable in length than those without capping protein ( with capping protein , 1 . 5 – 0 . 5 m m , n = 24 ; with - out capping protein , 2 . 6 – 1 . 4 m m , n = 43 ) , as a result of termination of barbed - end growth by capping protein . As with uncapped fila - ments , many new filaments were not associated with a pre - existing green filament ( Fig . 4j ) . In a third microscopy experiment , we used WA – Arp2 / 3 complex and green , ADP – actin - containing mother filaments capped on their barbed ends with gelsolin to stimulate polymerization of actin monomers in the presence of rhodamine – phalloidin to label new filaments . Branches formed on the sides of both green ( 67 % , n = 73 ) and red ( 33 % ) mother filaments ( Fig . 4k , l ) . Gelsolin effectively blocked elongation of barbed ends , but in the absence of profilin all mother filaments grew slowly at their free pointed ends . This veri - fies the geometry of branching inferred from earlier studies 6 , 10 , 11 . Because these polymerization reactions were carried out in the presence of phalloidin and were allowed to equilibrate before visu - alization , we carried out a fourth microscopy experiment . We incu - bated WA - activated Arp2 / 3 complex with Alexa 488 - labelled fila - ments containing ADP – P i , that were capped with capping protein . After a short incubation , we added profilin and actin monomers to the mixture . When the polymerization reached 80 % completion we briefly labelled the newly grown filaments with rhodamine – phal - loidin and quickly diluted the sample to minimize annealing . As in the continuous presence of phalloidin , short red branches formed directly on the sides of capped green mother filaments ( Fig . 4a ) . Neither in this experiment , nor in other microscopy experiments in which the Arp2 / 3 complex stimulated branching from capped or uncapped phalloidin - stabilized filaments , did we observe a prefer - ence for branches at what had been the barbed end of the stimula - tory filament , as indicated either by the filament end ( capped fila - ments ) or by the green / red boundary ( uncapped filaments ) . In the absence of filament dynamics ( as a result of the presence of phalloidin ) and of improbable annealing events in which the Arp2 / 3 complex binds between two filament ends , the Arp2 / 3 com - plex can only associate with the middle of a mother filament by lat - eral binding . Although our results clearly show that the Arp2 / 3 complex can form branches on the sides of filaments , they do not strictly rule out the occurrence of branching at barbed ends . However , it is difficult to reconcile side - binding with the proposed mechanism of barbed - end branching 8 , in which the Arp2 / 3 com - plex is incorporated into both the mother and daughter filaments , as such an intercalation into a mother filament would require dis - placement of monomers from the filament . Pantaloni et al . 8 have presented several arguments to support the barbed - end branching mechanism . These authors found that mother and daughter filaments nucleated by the Arp2 / 3 complex are of similar lengths by electron microscopy . Using a light - micro - scopic assay that may more accurately represent the native lengths of filaments , we found no such correlation and in fact found daughter branches to be significantly shorter than their mothers . Pantaloni and colleagues have presented kinetic modelling of actin polymerization nucleated by the Arp2 / 3 complex as support for barbed - end nucleation . As we explained previously 4 , 5 , we agree that nucleation mediated by the Arp2 / 3 complex is autocatalytic , with products ( actin filaments ) promoting catalysis of their own pro - duction . However , beyond the fact that some of the proposed reac - tions are purely hypothetical , this modelling in no way differenti - ates between barbed - end and side - binding mechanisms of nucle - ation and branching . Similarly , their fascinating observation that Listeria comet tails branch in ‘fish - bone’ structures in limiting con - centrations of gelsolin is consistent with branching nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex , but does not differentiate between nucleation at barbed ends or on the sides of filaments . Pantaloni and col - leagues have interpreted other results 8 as demonstrating that sec - ondary stimulation of nucleation by filaments depends on the con - centration of filament ends , rather than on the concentration of polymerized actin . However , these experiments were complicated by the fact that the large numbers of free barbed ends introduced into the experiment rapidly elongated , quickly producing a total concentration of polymerized actin that was uncontrolled and dif - ficult to predict accurately . Neither the experiments presented here nor our interpretation of the experiments of Pantaloni and colleagues supports barbed end branching or the idea of ‘functional antagonism’ between cap - ping protein and the Arp2 / 3 complex . As described here and else - where 6 , capping protein and the Arp2 / 3 complex act synergistically to favour the densely branched structures seen in cells . No experi - ment has demonstrated competition between these two proteins for barbed ends of actin filaments . Furthermore , we have shown here that the Arp2 / 3 complex mediates branching from the sides of pre - existing actin filaments , rather than from their barbed ends . Challenges remain in elucidating the molecular steps in the assembly and disassembly of actin - filament networks . Ultimately , real - time observation of nucleation , branch formation and elon - gation , and disassembly of filaments by severing and monomer Figure 3 Fluorescence micrographs of actin filaments nucleated by uncapped green mother filaments and the Arp2 / 3 complex .

Furthermore , the roles of many of the participants require better definition . For example , although the Arp2 / 3 complex is known to localize to branch points 12 , it is not yet known how long WASP / Scar proteins remain associated with the Arp2 / 3 complex at branches after nucleation . To date , most visualization of Arp2 / 3 complex branches has been aided by the presence of phalloidin , either fluorescent phalloidin for light microscopy or unlabelled phalloidin to allow extraction of cytoplasm for electron microscopy 12 . New experimental approach - es are needed to provide a clearer understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in this complex system . Methods Proteins . Actin was isolated from rabbit skeletal - muscle acetone powder 16 and further purified by gel filtration on Sephacryl S - 300 in Ca - G buffer ( 2mM imidazole pH7 . 0 , 0 . 2mM ATP , 0 . 1mM CaCl 2 and 0 . 5mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) ) . Pyrenyl – actin was produced by labelling Cys374 with pyrene iodoacetamide 17 , 18 . The Arp2 / 3 complex was purified from Acanthamoeba by poly - L - proline affinity chromatography 19 , further purified by S - 300 gel - filtration chromatography in complex storage buffer ( 10mM imidazole pH7 . 0 , 150mM NaCl , 0 . 1mM EGTA , 0 . 2mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2mM ATP , 1mM DTT and 0 . 02 % NaN 3 ) and stored at – 20 (cid:176) C in 50 % glycerol . Bovine Arp2 / 3 complex was purified from thymus 5 . Scar1 - WA , the 65 carboxy - terminal residues of human Scar1 protein 4 , was produced in bacteria from pMW172 ( ref . 20 ) without induction . Bacterial cell lysates were clarified at 65 , 000 g , gel - filtered on S - 300 , sub - jected to chromatography on DEAE cellulose and stored at – 20 (cid:176) C . This resulted in highly purified Scar1 - WA consisting of a single species of relative molecular mass 7 , 650 , as determined by MALDI DE . Profilin - I ( ref . 21 ) and capping protein 22 were purified from Acanthamoeba . Filaments capped with capping protein were produced by polymerizing 1 m M actin for 1h at 22 (cid:176) C in Mg - G buffer contain - ing 1 · KMEI ( 50mM KCl , 1mM MgCl 2 , 1mM EGTA and 10imidazole pH7 . 0 ) with 10nM or 33nM capping protein . Gelsolin – actin seeds were produced by incubating a 1 : 2 ratio of full - length recombinant human - plasma gelsolin 23 to actin in G buffer containing 200 m M CaCl 2 at 22 (cid:176) C for 2h and then incubating overnight at 4 (cid:176) C ( ref . 11 ) . Gelsolin - capped filaments were produced by incubat - ing 2 m M actin with a 1 : 1000 ratio of gelsolin to actin seeds for 30min at room temperature in Mg - G buffer plus 1 · KMEI . For use in fluorescence microscopy , a molar equivalent of Alexa 488 – phalloidin was added to capped filaments after polymerization and the mixture was incubated for 10min at 22 (cid:176) C . Pyrenyl – actin polymerization kinetics . Immediately before polymerization , Ca – ATP – actin was converted to Mg – ATP – actin by incubation with one - tenth of a volume of 10 · exchange buffer ( 10mM EGTA and 1mM MgCl 2 ) for 2min at 22 (cid:176) C . Proteins were mixed at 22 (cid:176) C in Mg - G buffer , and one - tenth of a volume of 10 · KMEI ( 500mM KCl , 10mM MgCl 2 , 10mM EGTA and 100mM imidazole , pH7 . 0 ) was added to initiate polymerization . Pyrene fluorescence of samples ( 200 m l ) was monitored using a Photon Technologies International spectrofluorimeter with excitation at 365nm and emission at 407nm . Branching assay . Products of polymerization were examined by fluorescence microscopy 11 . Proteins other than actin monomers were mixed in Mg - G buffer containing 1 · KMEI . Actin monomers and one molar equiva - lent of Alexa 488 – phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) or rhodamine – phalloidin ( Fluka , Steinheim , Germany ) were added and gently mixed . After polymerization for 15min ( unless otherwise specified ) at 22 (cid:176) C , samples were diluted 500 - fold in fresh fluorescence buffer ( 50mM KCl , 1mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM DTT , 10mM imidazole pH7 . 0 , 0 . 5 % methylcellulose , 20 m gml – 1 catalase , 100 m gml – 1 glucose oxi - dase and 3mgml – 1 glucose ) . Samples ( 1 . 6 m l ) were applied to coverslips ( 22 · 22mm ) previously coated either with 0 . 1 % nitrocellulose in amyl acetate or for 10min with 20 m gml – 1 poly - L - lysine . Samples were examined by mercury illumination at 100W on an Olympus IX - 70 inverted microscope using a · 100 , 1 . 35 NA objective lens and rhodamine ( ex : HQ545 / 30X , em : HQ610 / 75M , dc : 565DCLP ) and fluorescein ( ex : HQ4880 / 40 , em : HQ535 / 50 , dc : Q505LP ) filter sets ( Chroma Technology Corp . , Battleboro , Vermont ) . Images were recorded using a Hamamatsu C4742 - 95 digital camera controlled by Metamorph software ( Universal Imaging ) . Branches were verified as not being merely artifacts of overlain filaments by visualizing their brownian vibration 11 . Images were processed with Metamorph and Adobe Photoshop to generate two - colour images from monochromatic images . Random fields ( n » 10 ) were selected and the lengths of mother and daughter filaments for each branch in the field ( n » 100 ) were measured manually using Metamorph . The lengths of mother and daughter filaments were defined as the distance from the branching point to the filament tip . Length measurements were veri - fied by a blinded observer .
