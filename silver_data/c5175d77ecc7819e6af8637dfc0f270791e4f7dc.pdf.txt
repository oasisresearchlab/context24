However , reciprocal contradictory data have been reported , and the underlying mechanism remains unclear . This study aims to uncover differential role of RPM in regulation of wound healing and explore the possible mechanism . Methods : C57BL / 6J mice and epidermal cells were treated with different doses of RPM . The wound re - epithelialization was observed by hematoxylin and eosin ( HE ) staining . The expression of IL - 15 and IGF - 1 were detected by immunohistochemistry and quantitative real - time PCR . Epidermal cell survival was determined by CCK - 8 assays . Moreover , the mTORC1 and mTORC2 pathway were examined by western blot analysis . Results : This study showed that differential doses of RPM could lead to separate consequences in epidermis . Histological analyses showed that low - dose RPM promoted wound healing , and enhanced the expression of IL - 15 and IGF - 1 . Futhermore , western blot analysis showed that the effect of low - dose RPM in epidermis were not through mTORC1 pathway . Instead , activation of the Akt / mTORC2 pathway was involved in low - dose RPM - induced IL - 15 and IGF - 1 production in epidermis , while high - dose RPM inhibited the expression of IL - 15 and IGF - 1 and the activity of mTORC1 and mTORC2 pathway . Conclusion : This study for the first time demonstrated that RPM - mediated wound healing was dose - dependent . Introduction Rapamycin ( RPM ) is usually administered for prophylactic control of acute rejection of transplanted solid organs as well as for coating arterial stents and inhibiting tumor cell growth and tumor angiogenesis [ 1 - 5 ] . Hence , it is important in oncology , cardiology , and D o w n l oaded b y : U n i v e r s i t y o f C onne c t i c u t 132 . 1 74 . 250 . 220 - 12 / 27 / 201 7 8 : 23 : 45 A M Cell Physiol Biochem 2017 ; 42 : 1755 - 1768 DOI : 10 . 1159 / 000479443 Published online : July 26 , 2017 1756 Bai et al . : Differential Role of RPM in Wound Healing Cellular Physiology and Biochemistry Cellular Physiology and Biochemistry © 2017 The Author ( s ) . Published by S . Karger AG , Basel www . karger . com / cpb transplantation medicine [ 6 ] . Moreover , the effects of RPM on wound healing have been extensively studied [ 7 - 9 ] . However , there has been contradictory information regarding whether RPM delays wound healing via a γδ T cell defect in the skin tissue as reported by Robyn E . Mills [ 1 ] or promotes wound healing via RPM - induced autophagy in the epidermis , thus leading to faster re - epithelialization and stopping the progression of burn depth in a rat model , as described by Xiao et al . [ 10 ] . IL - 15 secreted by keratinocytes is required for dendritic epidermal T cell ( DETC ) development and epidermal homeostasis [ 11 , 12 ] . DETCs are the exclusive producer of insulin - like growth factor - 1 ( IGF - 1 ) in the epidermis [ 13 - 15 ] . For patients with serious skin defects , DETCs respond to damage - induced IL - 15 , and then DETCs produce IGF - 1 , which plays an important role in maintaining the skin barrier function and accelerating the wound repair process [ 13 - 15 ] . However , whether RPM affects the secretion of IL - 15 and IGF - 1 in epidermis during wound repair remains unclear . It is well known that RPM inhibits the serine / threonine kinase mammalian target mTOR . mTOR is formed by two separate protein complexes , mTOR complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) and mTOR complex 2 ( mTORC2 ) , and RPM has generally been believed to interact with mTORC1 but not mTORC2 [ 1 , 16 , 17 ] . However , prolonged treatment of some cell lines with RPM results in reduced levels of mTORC2 , as well as decreased phosphorylation of Akt Serine 473 , the downstream target of mTORC2 [ 6 , 18 , 19 ] . Interestingly , short - term treatment resulted in increased Akt phosphorylation due to compensatory , high levels of mTORC2 [ 18 ] . Previous work has shown that responses of Akt in tumor cells to RPM may be dose - related [ 17 , 19 ] . In addition , at lower RPM doses , researchers found elevated levels of phosphorylated Akt ( Ser473 ) , and when the concentration of RPM increased , the level of phosphorylated Akt ( Ser473 ) decreased . Recently , several studies have shown that IL - 15 can augment the activation of the mTOR pathway . Consistently , suppression of the mTOR pathway may abolish the IL - 15 - induced advantageous activity in cells [ 20 , 21 ] . Moreover , high - dose and prolonged treatment with RPM , which impairs the mTOR pathway , remarkably reduces IGF - 1 secretion from DETCs [ 1 ] . Above all , how RPM interacts with Akt and mTORC2 remains unclear . Furthermore , the roles of RPM in regulation of IL - 15 , IGF - 1 and mTOR in the wound healing process remain unanswered . In the present study , we show for the first time that low - dose RPM enhances the expression of IL - 15 and IGF - 1 in the epidermis , and promotes wound healing . More importantly and interestingly , we uncover that low - dose RPM activates phosphorylation of SIN1 at Threonine 86 in epidermal cells , enhancing activation of the Akt / mTORC2 pathway . These findings may help us better understand the RPM - mediated regulation of wound healing . Materials and Methods Animals C57BL / 6J ( C57 ) mice ( male , 20 - 22 g ) at 8 to 10 weeks of age were purchased from the Experimental Animal Department of the Third Military Medical University . All animals were maintained under specific pathogen - free conditions . All animal studies were performed in compliance with the guidelines the Ethic Committee for Animal Experiment of The Third Military Medical University . Preparation and administration of rapamycin A stock powder of RPM ( 25 mg , Selleck Chemicals , USA ) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at a final concentration of 20 µg / µL . This RPM solution was then divided into aliquots of 10 µl each and stored at - 80°C . Epidermal cells were treated with different concentrations of RPM . Doses of 5 ng / ml RPM or 20 ng / ml RPM served as the low dose and high dose , respectively , for cell treatment administration in vitro . The doses were chosen based on our pilot experiments ( for all online suppl . material , see www . karger . com / doi / 10 . 1159 / 000479443 , Supplementary Fig . S4 ) .

The doses were chosen based on the manufacturer’s specifications ( Selleck Chemicals , USA ) and our pilot experiments ( see supplementary material , Supplementary Fig . S5 ) . Isolation of epidermal cells Skin harvested from C57 mice ( male , 20 - 22 g ) at 8 to 10 weeks of age were washed with sterile phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS , pH 7 . 4 ) twice . Then , the skin sample was cut into approximately 0 . 5 cm 2 pieces and digested with 0 . 5 g / l Dispase II ( Sigma - Aldrich , GER ) at 4°C overnight . After that , the epidermis was separated from the dermis . The epidermis was washed with PBS , collected and minced , then digested with 0 . 5 % trypsin at 37°C . After 10 minutes , Roswell Park Memorial Institute - 1640 ( RPMI - 1640 , Gibco , USA ) culture medium containing 10 % fetal bovine serum was added to discontinue the digestion . After being filtered through a cell strainer , the cells were collected via centrifugation . The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 100 mg / ml of streptomycin , 100 U / ml penicillin and 2 mM glutamine ( HyClone , USA ) and used for the following experiments . Cell Counting Kit - 8 ( CCK - 8 ) assay An epidermal cell suspension was adjusted to 1 × 10 4 / ml , and 100 μl of the cell suspension was seeded in each well of a 96 - well plate . Either low - dose or high - dose RPM was added to each corresponding well . Cells cultured without RPM served as controls . The cells were cultured at 37°C in a 5 % CO 2 incubator . After culture for 12 hours or 24 hours , 10 μl of CCK - 8 reagent ( Dojindo , JPN ) was added to each well . After incubation at 37°C for 2 hours , the absorbance was measured at 450 nm using an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay reader ( Thermo Varioskan Flash , USA ) as previously reported [ 22 ] . Experiments were repeated 5 times . Quantitative real - time PCR An epidermal cell suspension was adjusted to 1 × 10 6 / ml , and 1 ml of the cell suspension was seeded in each well of a 12 - well plate . The epidermal cells were isolated from the epidermis of C57 adult mice and were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum for 2 hours . After treatment with either 5 ng / ml RPM ( low dose ) or 20 ng / ml RPM ( high dose ) for 24 hours in 12 - well plates , cultured cells were washed with PBS , and total RNA was extracted with an RNeasy ® Mini kit ( QIAGEN , GER ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The RNA concentration and quality were measured using a DU800 UV / Vis spectrophotometer ( Beckman Coulter , USA ) , and mRNA was reverse transcribed using First Strand cDNA Synthesis kits ( TOYOBO , JPN ) . Real - time PCR was performed using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix ( TOYOBO , JPN ) under the following conditions : 95°C for 2 minutes followed by 50 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds , 60°C for 15 seconds , and 72°C for 32 seconds . mRNA levels were quantified using an ABI PRISM 7500 Sequence Detection System ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) according to the manufacturer’s protocols . The data were analyzed by the 2 - ΔΔ threshold ( Ct ) method , and GAPDH served as an internal control . The sequences of primers used were as follows : IL - 15 : 5ʹ - GGATTTACCGTGGCTTTGAGTAATGAG - 3ʹ ( forward ) , 5ʹ - GAATCAATTGCAATCAAGAAGTG - 3ʹ ( reverse ) ; IGF - 1 : 5ʹ - GGACCAAGGGGCTTTTACTT - 3ʹ ( forward ) , 5ʹ - GCAACACTCATCCACAATG - 3ʹ ( reverse ) ; GAPDH : 5ʹ - CGTGCCGCCTGGAGAAAC - 3ʹ ( forward ) , 5ʹ - AGTGGGAGTTGCTGTTGAAGTC - 3ʹ ( reverse ) . Western blot analysis After treatment of cells with different concentrations of RPM in vitro or in vivo , proteins were extracted from cells using lysis kits ( KeyGEN BioTECH , CA ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . The cell lysates were agitated for 20 minutes followed by centrifugation at 14 , 000 rpm / min for 15 minutes at 4°C . The supernatant was collected as total cellular protein . Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein assay ( Thermo Scientific , USA ) . An equal amount of protein ( 20 μg ) from each sample was loaded onto 10 % SDS - PAGE gels , and electrophoresis was performed at 80 volts for 30 minutes and then at 100 volts for 1 . 5 hours . The separated proteins were then transferred to a polyvinylidenedifluoride ( PVDF ) membrane ( Millipore Immobilon , USA ) . The PVDF membrane was blocked with Tris - buffered saline ( TBS ) containing 3 % bovine serum albumin ( BIOSHARP , CA ) for 2 hours at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibodies against IGF - 1 and IL - 15 ( 1 : 200 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , USA ) ; p - p70S6K ( Thr389 ) , S6K , p - Akt ( Ser473 ) , Akt , p - 4E - BP1 ( Thr37 / 46 ) , 4E - BP1 and p - SIN1 ( Thr86 ) ( 1 : 1 , 000 , Cell Signaling Technologies , Beverly , USA ) ; SIN - 1 , mTOR , Raptor and Rictor ( 1 : 1 , 000 , Abcam , UK ) ; and GAPDH D o w n l oaded b y : U n i v e r s i t y o f C onne c t i c u t 132 . 1 74 . 250 . 220 - 12 / 27 / 201 7 8 : 23 : 45 A M Cell Physiol Biochem 2017 ; 42 : 1755 - 1768 DOI : 10 . 1159 / 000479443 Published online : July 26 , 2017 1758 Bai et al . : Differential Role of RPM in Wound Healing Cellular Physiology and Biochemistry Cellular Physiology and Biochemistry © 2017 The Author ( s ) .

The membranes were subsequently washed 5 times with TBS containing 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ( TBST ) and then incubated with HRP - labeled secondary antibody ( 1 : 5000 , ZSGB - BIO , CHN ) for 1 hour at room temperature . The membranes were washed with TBST again and finally visualized and analyzed using enhanced chemiluminescence ( Pierce , USA ) and a ChemiDoc TM XRS western blot detection system ( Bio - Rad , USA ) . Wounding procedure For RPM administration , C57 mice were injected i . p . daily with 200 μl of low - dose RPM ( 0 . 04 mg / kg ) , high - dose RPM ( 4 mg / kg ) or vehicle control ( dissolved in 0 . 2 % CMC and 0 . 25 % Tween 80 in distilled H 2 O ) for 15 days before wounding , and daily administration was continued during the wound healing process ( on post - wounding days 0 - 7 ) . The administration dose of RPM was chosen based on our pilot study ( see supplementary material , Supplementary Fig . S5 ) . Wounding was performed on mice anesthetized with 1 % sodium pentobarbital . Briefly , the dorsal surface of the mouse was shaved , and two sets of sterile full - thickness wounds were generated using a sterile 4 - mm punch tool . The survey of wound healing was performed as previously reported with minor revision [ 23 , 24 ] . Wounds were left uncovered , and mice were kept individually with sterile paper bedding . Wounds on at least five mice were examined in each group in three independent experiments . Analysis of the re - epithelialization during wound healing On day 3 and day 6 post - wounding , mice were sacrificed and the wound tissues were carefully biopsied . Tissues were fixed with 4 % formaldehyde , embedded in paraffin , and sectioned at a thickness of 5 μm . Hematoxylin and eosin ( HE ) staining and histological analyses were performed , and the length of the neo - epithelium was determined using IPP 6 . 0 software ; the measurement procedures were performed blindly by two pathologists [ 23 , 24 ] . Experiments were repeated 5 times . Immunohistochemistry The paraffin sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated . After incubation with Antigen Retrieval Solution ( Boster Biotechnology , CHN ) for 20 minutes , the sections were incubated with 3 % H 2 O 2 for 15 minutes , blocked with 10 % normal goat serum ( Zhongshan Biology Company , CHN ) for 1 hour at 37°C and then incubated with primary antibody ( IGF - 1 , 1 : 200 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , USA ; IL 15 , 1 : 200 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , USA ) overnight at 4°C . Sections were incubated with biotinylated goat - anti - rabbit IgG antibody ( Zhongshan Biology Company , CHN ) for 15 minutes and sequentially incubated with avidin peroxidase reagent ( Zhongshan Biology Company , CHN ) . Diaminobenzidine solution was used as the chromogenic agent . After counterstaining with hematoxylin , sections were photographed using an optical microscope ( CTR6000 , Leica , GER ) [ 24 ] . Statistical analysis Statistical comparisons were performed using Student’s t - test or one - way ANOVA with Graphpad Prism 6 . 0 software ( Graphpad Software Inc , USA ) . Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) . In all cases , a p value less than 0 . 05 was considered statistically significant . Results Epidermal cell survival was promoted in the low - dose RPM group compared with the control or high - dose RPM groups Epidermal cell survival in vitro under the condition of different concentrations of RPM was determined using a CCK - 8 assay ( Fig . 1A ) . After 12 hours of culture , the average of the absorbance was 0 . 782 in the low - dose RPM group ( 5 ng / ml ) , which was higher than that in the high - dose RPM group ( 20 ng / ml , 0 . 644 ) and the control group ( 0 . 676 ) ( Fig . 1A ) , indicating that more cells were viable in the low - dose RPM group than in the other two groups . After culture for 24 hours , the highest number of viable cells was found in the low - dose RPM group , followed by the control group , and the lowest number of cells was found in the high - dose RPM group ( the average absorbance was 0 . 77 , 0 . 684 and 0 . 562 , in sequence ; Fig . 1A ) .

Published by S . Karger AG , Basel www . karger . com / cpb Expression of IL - 15 and IGF - 1 were enhanced in the presence of low - dose RPM The expression of IL - 15 and IGF - 1 was detected using real - time PCR and Western blot . As shown , the IL - 15 ( Fig . 1B ) and IGF - 1 ( Fig . 1C ) mRNA level were elevated in the low - dose RPM group compared with the control group . High - dose RPM in fact significantly inhibited the expression of IL - 15 ( Fig . 1B ) and IGF - 1 ( Fig . 1C ) . We further detected the protein level of IL - 15 and IGF - 1 at different RPM treatment times . The IL - 15 protein level was found to be rapidly upregulated 10 minutes after treatment with low - dose RPM . In contrast , IL - 15 production was significantly attenuated by high - dose RPM ( Fig . 1D and 1E ) . The IGF - 1 protein level in epidermal cells was also upregulated after low - dose RPM treatment for 10 minutes , while high - dose RPM inhibited the expression of IGF - 1 after the epidermal cells were treated for 1 hour ( Fig . 1D and 1F ) . As IGF - 1 is produced exclusively by DETCs in the epidermal compartment [ 14 ] , we therefore detected the number of DETCs in the control , low - dose RPM and high - dose RPM groups ( see supplementary material , Supplementary Fig . S1A and S1B ) . It was found that the number of DETCs was not significantly different in the low - dose RPM group compared with the vehicle control after 24 hours , and was apparently decreased in the high - dose RPM group in vitro . γδ TCR and IGF - 1 were further co - stained to evaluate the production of IGF - 1 in the DETCS using FACS ( see supplementary material , Supplementary Fig . S2 ) . The DETC - derived IGF - 1 was significantly increased in epidermal cells treated with both recombinant IL - 15 ( 100 ng / ml ) and low - dose RPM ( see supplementary material , Supplementary Fig .

Meanwhile , the protein expression of Rictor , p - SIN1 ( Thr86 ) and SIN1 were also upregulated after the cells were treated with low - dose RPM ( Fig . 2A , and 2C - 2E ) , while the expression of Rictor , p - SIN1 ( Thr86 ) and SIN1 were inhibited by high - dose RPM at 12 or 24 hours ( Fig . 2A , and 2C - 2E ) . The data also showed that the downstream p - Akt ( Ser473 ) protein level was upregulated rapidly 10 min after administration of low - dose RPM and reached the highest level in 1 hour , whereas high - dose RPM down - regulated the p - Akt ( Ser473 ) level ( Fig . 2A , and 2F - 2G ) .

However , high - dose RPM significantly inhibited the expression of Raptor , p - 4E - BP1 ( Thr37 / 46 ) and p - p70S6K ( Thr389 ) at 12 or 24 hours ( Fig . 3A - 3C and 3E ) . In addition , 4E - BP1 ( Fig . 3A and 3D ) and p70S6K are also shown ( Fig . 3A and 3F ) . Wound healing was accelerated after treatment with low - dose RPM As the different doses of RPM showed differential effects on epidermal cell proliferation , we then tested whether either low - or high - dose RPM could also have differential role in epithelialization during wound healing from day 0 to day 7 . The results showed that administration of high - dose RPM to mice delayed wound healing compared with the control group ( Fig . 4A and 4B ) , while administration of low - dose RPM to mice significantly promoted wound healing on days 3 , 4 and 6 post - wounding ( Fig . 4A and 4B ) . The average healing time in the low - dose RPM group was 6 days , and wounds in the control and high - dose RPM groups remained open after 6 days ( Fig . 4A and 4B ) . We then tested the speed of re - epithelialization , i . e . , the measurement of the length of the newly formed epithelium on wounds , under either low - or high - dose RPM treatment . The results showed that the average length of the epithelial tongue was 901 μm in the low - dose RPM group , 619 μm in the control group , and 340 μm in the high - dose RPM group at Fig . 3 .

There were fewer DETCs ( 1 . 87 % ) around the wound in high - dose RPM - treated mice compared with wounds of mice treated with low - dose RPM and vehicle control ( see supplementary material , Supplementary Fig . S3A and S3B ) . Differential effect of RPM on IL - 15 and IGF - 1 expression around the wound site The expression of IL - 15 and IGF - 1 around the wound site was detected from day 1 to day 6 post - wounding after administration of different doses RPM ( Fig . 6 ) . It was found that the IL - 15 ( Fig . 6A and 6B ) and IGF - 1 ( Fig . 6D and 6E ) protein levels were upregulated in the low - dose RPM group and reached the highest level on day 1 to day 3 after RPM administration based on a Western blot analysis , while high - dose RPM significantly inhibited the expression of IL - 15 ( Fig . 6A and 6B ) and IGF - 1 ( Fig . 6D and 6E ) . Consistent with the Western blot results , immunohistochemical staining for IL - 15 ( Fig . 6C ) and IGF - 1 ( Fig . 6F ) was found to be more intensive in the low - dose RPM group than in the high - dose group . Differential effect of RPM on the phosphorylation of Akt Ser473 in vivo In the mouse wound healing model , we determined the effects of different doses of RPM on mTOR signaling during the post - wounding from day 1 to day 6 ( Fig . 7 ) . Upon low - dose RPM treatment , Akt is phosphorylated at Ser473 from day 1 to day 4 post - wounding . Among the three groups , the p - Akt ( Ser473 ) protein level was highest in the low - dose RPM group . In contrast , the phosphorylation of Akt was severely impaired after treatment with high - dose RPM ( Fig . 7A - 7C ) . Meanwhile , signaling through mTORC1 was not affected by different doses of RPM compared with vehicle control ( Fig . 7A and 7D - G ) . The protein expression of p - p70S6k ( Thr389 ) ( Fig . 7A and 7D ) and p - 4E - BP1 ( Thr37 / 46 ) ( Fig . 7A and 7F ) in the low - dose RPM group was similar to that in the control group .

Discussion Rapamycin ( RPM ) , a specific inhibitor of mechanistic target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) , has been shown to have potent immunosuppressive properties and antitumor activity [ 1 , 25 ] . It is believed that RPM can inhibit T and B cell activation and proliferation [ 26 ] . However , it has also been reported that T cell proliferation is not affected when treated with RPM at an appropriate concentration [ 27 ] . Meanwhile , it has also been reported that RPM can protect neuronal cells from apoptosis by inducing autophagy , which indicates that RPM has a cytoprotective effect [ 28 , 29 ] . Fig . 7 . Low - dose RPM activates the mTORC2 but not mTORC1 pathway in the epidermis around the wound edge . ( A ) C57 mice were treated with low - dose RPM ( 0 . 04 mg / kg ) , high - dose RPM ( 4 mg / kg ) and vehicle control for the indicated period , followed by a western blot analysis .

Published by S . Karger AG , Basel www . karger . com / cpb The effects of RPM on wound healing have been studied and the results are paradoxical . Mills has reported that i . p . injection of approximately 100 mg / kg RPM in adult C57 mice was responsible for a delay in wound closure by impairing the function of dendritic epidermal T cells ( DETCs ) , including reducing DETC - derived factors such as insulin - like growth factor - 1 ( IGF - 1 ) [ 1 ] . However , Xiao found that i . p . injection of 1 mg / kg RPM could ameliorate the early progression of burn depth and promote wound healing in a rat model of deep second - degree burn wounds through autophagy enhancement [ 10 ] . Given these studies , we sought to determine if differential doses of RPM would lead to separate consequences in wound healing . To test this hypothesis , we cultured epidermal cells isolated from adult C57 mice , treated with different concentration of RPM for 12 hours and 24 hours . According to the CCK - 8 assay , our results revealed that a higher number of viable epidermal cells were present in the low - dose RPM group ( 5 ng / ml ) than in the control and high - dose RPM groups ( 20 ng / ml ) at 12 hours and 24 hours . Until 24 hours of treatment , epidermal cell numbers decreased in the high - dose RPM group compared with the other two groups ( Fig . 1A ) . These results indicated that ( i ) low - dose RPM had a cytoprotective effect that promoted cell survival in vitro ( obviously from 12 hours to 24 hours ) , and ( ii ) prolonged treatment ( 24 hours ) with high - dose RPM inhibited cell survival and cell proliferation . Based on the following tests , we found that IL - 15 was elevated in the presence of low - dose RPM in epidermal cells at both the mRNA and protein level . Previous studies have verified that keratinocytes are the main component and the major source of IL - 15 in the epidermis [ 30 ] , and IL - 15 augmented mTOR signaling , which is related to cell metabolism and respiration . Lee and colleagues reported that IL - 15 could activate PI3K and phosphorylate Akt at Thr308 [ 31 ] , and furthermore , activation of PI3K / Akt ( Thr308 ) phosphorylated SIN1 at Thr86 , enhancing mTORC2 kinase activity , which leads to phosphorylation of Akt Ser473 by mTORC2 , thereby catalyzing full activation of Akt [ 32 ] . In our study , we found that the expression of p - SIN1 ( Thr86 ) , Rictor and downstream p - Akt ( Ser473 ) was enhanced under the condition of low - dose RPM , which indicated that mTORC2 signaling was activated due to the increase in IL - 15 induced by low - dose RPM . In addition , activation of mTORC2 has been shown to maintain the survival of keratinocytes [ 33 ] , which was also confirmed in our study as mentioned above . It is generally believed that RPM is a specific ( mTOR ) inhibitor that interacts with mTORC1 ( composed of mTOR , mLST8 , and Raptor ) [ 1 ] , while the distinct complex of mTOR , mLST8 , SIN1 and Rictor ( mTORC2 ) is not thought to be RPM sensitive [ 6 , 34 ] . However , Sarbassov et al . reported that prolonged RPM treatment inhibits mTORC2 assembly and Akt in cells [ 6 ] . In our study , to determine if dose - related RPM can alter the levels of intact mTORC1 and / or mTORC2 , we cultured the epidermal cells isolated from adult C57 mice treated with low - dose and high - dose RPM for 10 minutes or 1 , 12 , or 24 hours ( Fig . 2 and Fig . 3 ) . Our experiments demonstrated that after treatment with high - dose RPM for 24 hours , the expression of p - SIN1 ( Thr86 ) , p - Akt ( Ser473 ) and Rictor in epidermal cells was drastically decreased . In addition , the phosphorylation of downstream p70S6K ( Thr389 ) , 4E - BP1 ( Thr37 / 46 ) and Raptor was also impaired . These results showed that prolonged treatment ( 24 hours ) with high - dose RPM significantly inhibited mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling . Interestingly , low - dose RPM treatment did not affect the expression of p - p70S6K ( Thr389 ) , 4E - BP1 ( Thr37 / 46 ) and Raptor compared with vehicle control during the four time points . Instead , p - SIN1 ( Thr86 ) was activated by low - dose RPM compared with vehicle control in 10 minutes , and the downstream target of mTORC2 , p - Akt ( Ser473 ) , was increased rapidly after 10 minutes as well and reached the highest level in 1 hour . Moreover , the expression of Rictor and mTOR were upregulated after treatment for 12 hours . In addition , Phung reported that p - Akt was elevated at lower rapamycin doses ( 1 - 4 ng / ml ) in primary endothelial cells isolated from human skin , and it steadily diminished as the concentration of rapamycin was increased [ 17 ] . Based on the data here and previous reports , we concluded that RPM might interact with mTORC1 and mTORC2 in a dose - and time - dependent manner , and low - dose RPM treatment resulted in increased levels of mTORC2 , as well as increased D o w n l oaded b y : U n i v e r s i t y o f C onne c t i c u t 132 . 1 74 . 250 . 220 - 12 / 27 / 201 7 8 : 23 : 45 A M Cell Physiol Biochem 2017 ; 42 : 1755 - 1768 DOI : 10 . 1159 / 000479443 Published online : July 26 , 2017 1766 Bai et al . : Differential Role of RPM in Wound Healing Cellular Physiology and Biochemistry Cellular Physiology and Biochemistry © 2017 The Author ( s ) . Published by S . Karger AG , Basel www . karger . com / cpb phosphorylation of the downstream target Akt ( Ser473 ) , without affecting the levels of mTORC1 . O’Reilly’s studies showed that the concentration of 1 nmol / L RPM in tumor cell culture induces mTORC2 activity , resulting in increased p - Akt ( Ser473 ) levels [ 19 ] . Yang Guang and colleagues have revealed that phosphorylation of SIN1 ( Thr86 ) mediated a positive feedback loop between Akt and mTORC2 [ 32 ] . Accordingly , enhancement of the activity of the Akt / mTORC2 pathway by low - dose RPM treatment might promote epidermal cell survival . Notably , IL - 15 plays an important role in altering DETC development and homeostasis in epidermis [ 35 , 36 ] . DETCs are known to play a positive role in wound healing [ 37 ] , and secretion of insulin - like growth factor - 1 ( IGF - 1 ) in DETCs plays positive roles in keratinocyte proliferation [ 13 ] . In our study , we found that the IL - 15 protein level was upregulated , and we further detected the expression of IGF - 1 in the presence of low - dose RPM in epidermal cells . Indeed , it was found that the IGF - 1 protein level was also upregulated . On the other hand , high - dose RPM inhibited the expression of IGF - 1 significantly in epidermal cell culture after 24 hours ( Fig . 1 ) . The low - dose RPM - induced upregulation of DETC - derived IGF - 1 might also be beneficial to keratinocyte survival and proliferation . Furthermore , we found through a FACS analysis that recombinant IL - 15 upregulated the expression of DETC - derived IGF - 1 in epidermis ( see supplementary material , Supplementary Fig . S2 ) . The result revealed that keratinocyte - secreted IL - 15 may enhance DETC activation to produce IGF - 1 and may mediated a positive feedback loop during wound repair . The in vitro results inspired us , and we performed wound healing experiments to determine whether the in vitro results were replicable in vivo . It was found that wound healing was accelerated when mice were intraperitoneally injected with low - dose RPM ( 0 . 04 mg / kg ) over a prolonged time . Reversely , the same method of prolonged treatment with high - dose RPM ( 4 mg / kg ) hindered the wound healing process ( Fig . 4 ) , which has been reported in previous studies [ 1 , 7 , 9 ] . We found that wound re - epithelialization was enhanced after treatment with low - dose RPM ( Fig . 5 ) , and the enhanced wound re - epithelialization might result from the secretion of IL - 15 and IGF - 1 in the epidermis at the wound edge . In our study , it was found that the expression of both IL - 15 and IGF - 1 was upregulated at the wound site in the low - dose RPM group and reversely suppressed in the high - dose RPM group ( Fig . 6 ) . Thus , upregulated levels of IL - 15 might activate DETCs ( the number of DETCs in epidermis was not changed in the low - dose RPM group compared with that in the control group ( see supplementary material , Supplementary Fig . S3 ) and more IGF - 1 could be secreted from the activated DETCs . In addition , keratinocytes could respond to IGF - 1 via IGFR for cell survival and cell proliferation [ 38 ] , and the enhanced IGF - 1 expression might partially explain the accelerated wound healing after the mice were treated with low - dose RPM . In addition , we detected the expression of the mTOR pathway in epidermis at the wound edge ( Fig . 7 ) . It was revealed that the phosphorylation of the downstream target Akt ( Ser473 ) of the mTORC2 pathway was activated when mice were treated with low - dose RPM . At the same time , the expression of p - p70S6K ( Thr389 ) and p - 4E - BP1 ( Thr37 / 46 ) of the mTORC1 pathway was not effected by low - dose RPM treatment . Overall , the in vivo data further confirmed that the Akt / mTORC2 pathway controlled the expression of IL - 15 and IGF - 1 by regulating the function of epidermal cells , and was involved in the accelerated wound healing process . In this study , we uncover a novel role of low - dose RPM in regulation of wound healing , i . e . , low - dose RPM upregulates the expression of IL - 15 and IGF - 1 in the epidermis , which maintains the survival of keratinocytes and the activity of DETCs by activating Akt / mTORC2 patway and ultimately accelerating wound healing . Further studies are required to unravel the possible mechanism of how low - dose RPM upregulates the expression of IL - 15 and IGF - 1 .
