Exploring Distributed Synthesis : In - Progress Findings from Guided Tours of Scholarly Knowledge Synthesis Work Practices with A Distributed Lens Siyi Zhu University of Maryland , College Park United States zhusy @ umd . edu Joel Chan University of Maryland , College Park United States joelchan @ umd . edu ABSTRACT Synthesis — the construction of a new conceptual whole that ad - vances understanding — is critical for research progress . Its current practice is also extremely laborious and costly . In this paper , we explore what fresh ideas CSCW might have to offer for making ef - fective synthesis less painful and more commonplace . In particular , we draw on CSCW ideas around distributed sensemaking and inte - grated crowdsourcing to explore the idea of distributed synthesis : systems for sharing and reusing intermediate synthesis materials such as annotations and notes to kickstart and accelerate the syn - thesis process . We report in - progress findings from our analysis of in - depth guided tours of scholarly synthesis work practices , to bridge the gap between distributed sensemaking and integrated crowdsourcing ( which has not yet been studied in the setting of scholarly synthesis ) and scholarly synthesis workflows ( which have not yet been analyzed from a distributed lens ) .

Our work here responds to the specific observation that synthesis work is , by many accounts , extremely arduous [ 8 , 15 , 23 ] and cost - intensive [ 7 , 8 , 28 , 32 , 38 ] . Audits of synthesis quality sug - gest that the level of infeasibility may be translating into significant deficits in synthesis quality in published research outputs , such as literature reviews in doctoral dissertations [ 6 , 16 , 25 ] and published papers [ 2 – 4 , 11 , 27 , 43 ] . What might CSCW research have to offer for this problem ? And what might new insights about CSCW might be gained through deep reflection on this problem context ? We think there may be some fresh ideas to draw from existing CSCW work around dis - tributed sensemaking [ 10 , 14 , 17 , 21 , 22 , 30 ] — structured hand - offs of intermediate sensemaking products such as annotations and schemas for others to use as starting points for their own sensemak - ing — and integrated crowdsourcing — - seamlessly integrating ordinarily laborious secondary tasks that are valuable for others ( e . g . , semantic judgments ) into a primary task that people are al - ready intrinsically motivated to do [ 19 , 39 , 44 ] . As two concrete examples , Kittur et al [ 21 ] designed a system that allowed con - sumers to draw on categories / tags and clippings from previous consumers searching for similar products , to kickstart and struc - ture their sensemaking and foraging process while doing research to purchase consumer products like digital cameras ; and Siangliu - lue et al [ 39 ] built a system that drew information about semantic similarity between ideas from the intrinsically motivating act of clustering ideas ( on virtual post - its ) on a virtual whiteboard , which was then used to construct a semantic space that could be used for mapping a solution space in collective brainstorming . These design patterns demonstrate models for self - sustaining , virtuous cycles of collective intelligence . Drawing on these ideas , we are curious about the possibility of constructing distributed synthesis systems . Could we construct self - sustainable systems for synthesis that draw intermediate syn - thesis materials — annotations , tags , notes — from primary tasks of the research lifecycle , such as reading and note - taking , manuscript preparation , or peer review , and feed into a distributed system that helped other researchers more quickly find and synthesize relevant ideas for their problems from the literature ? Could this distributed approach help to address persistent problems in existing efforts to incentive and sustain contributions of synthesis materials , from traditional forms , such as review papers , to newer forms , such as se - mantic " micropublishing " of networks of granular claims and their context [ 24 , 35 ] . As a concrete example of this authorship bottle - neck , the popular Mark2Cure project — a citizen science approach 328 CSCW ’23 Companion , October 14 – 18 , 2023 , Minneapolis , MN , USA Zhu and Chan to extracting gene - drug - disease relationships from biomedical ab - stracts [ 42 ] — - had to shut down due to inability to sustain enough participation to curate enough knowledge to uncover clues for identifying potential treatment strategies for NGLY1 - deficiency [ 13 ] . The problem that motivates our study is the disconnect between the ideas of distributed sensemaking and integrated crowdsourcing with the specific setting of scholarly synthesis . The design pat - terns of distributed sensemaking and integrated crowdsourcing are well - studied in some domains , such as doing travel planning or researching consumer products [ 10 , 21 ] , design brainstorming [ 39 ] , intelligence analysis [ 30 ] , and learning [ 20 ] , but have not yet been directly applied to the setting of scholarly synthesis . On the flip side , we do have rich descriptions of scholarly practices , but without a particular focus on potential connections between indi - vidual / collaborative practice and distributed synthesis . For example , past work has articulated the various types of information artifacts that are produced during synthesis work , such as contextual infor - mation [ 5 , 29 ] , hypothesis projections [ 5 ] , in - source annotations , per - source summaries , and cross - source syntheses [ 34 ] . From a process - perspective , we have extensions of individual sensemaking models [ 33 ] to describe the synthesis process as similarly non - linear and iterative [ 12 , 34 ] and interleaved with multiple information behaviors , including information foraging , information retrieval , and sensemaking [ 31 ] . However , these descriptions have not yet been systematically analyzed with particular attention to questions of retrieval and reuse of information artifacts , either by oneself or others . To design systems for integrating contributions to distributed synthesis systems , we need to understand more deeply questions like " What information artifacts produced and used during individual synthesis might be useful for sharing with others in a distributed manner ? " and " What information practices and tooling affordances in individual synthesis might serve as points of integration into dis - tributed synthesis systems ? " . 2 METHODS To address these questions , we conducted guided tour studies [ 9 , 41 ] to investigate synthesis practices from a distributed perspective . For this study , we recruited 21 researchers . Our participants were quite diverse in terms of disciplines and topics , including computer science , cognitive science , law , mathematics , economics , and busi - ness , and more ( see Table 1 for more details ) ; the unifying factor was the prominence of synthesis ( vs . engineering / implementation ) in their research projects , and such as mapping out new design spaces to push the boundaries of some design problem ( P01 , P02 , P05 , P10 , P12 , P13 , P15 , P16 ) , critical reviews of and theory - building from prior literature ( P04 , P06 , P09 , P11 , P14 ) . Additionally , given our focus on discovering potentially new affordances / practices we might integrate distributed synthesis systems into , we recruited participants in part from user communities of newer or niche tools such as RoamResearch 1 , a personal hypertext notebook , in addition to recruiting participants from within academia / industry who use traditional tools and workflows , such as Google Docs . Table 1 shows 1 https : / / roamresearch . com / the tools and research areas of the participants we have analyzed so far . The participants took part remotely via video meetings . Partici - pants first shared with us the specific research directions for which they are conducting synthesis work , which grounded the guided tour of their synthesis practices . Then , for the guided tour por - tion , they shared their screens and walked through their synthesis workflows , first for their individual synthesis work , and then for col - laborative synthesis work ( if any ) . Throughout , we asked followup and probing questions about changes to their workflows / systems , sources of structure and the forms of artifacts , and remaining pain points . Each interview lasted approximately 1 - 1 . 5 hours . After tran - scribing the recordings into text - based transcripts , the first author performed open coding on these interview transcripts and captured screenshots of the participants’ shared screens displaying their work processes , and iterated on the codes through discussion with the second author . The open coding was focused on the partici - pants’ behavior regarding information artifacts , aiming to identify the relationship between information reuse at the individual level and the collaborative level . 3 PRELIMINARY RESULTS To date , we have analyzed 16 participants ( see Table 1 ) . So far , we have observed more instances of reusing information artifacts for individual synthesis work , compared to sharing for collaborative synthesis work . However , we have sufficient data to notice emerg - ing themes around the differences in challenges associated with reusing information artifacts in individual synthesis work com - pared to those encountered when sharing synthesis information artifacts with others in collaborative synthesis work . 3 . 1 Reuse in individual synthesis A few participants reported that contextual information was impor - tant for successfully reusing previously encountered or processed information during individual synthesis work . For example , P4 con - firmed whether his current understanding aligns with previously highlighted texts by using contextual information , saying " You don’t want to just take out the highlight . You want to double check your things , your understanding of this unit . So , like few lines above and below , just to make sure that you get it right . " P13 also described how margin notes support his understanding of original quotes that were highlighted in the past , saying , “ ( margin notes make it ) so much easier for me to jump to this quote here and say , cool , I re - member exactly why I highlighted this is because I wanted to make it clear that we’re not focusing on education . ” We also observed how both under - structured and overly struc - tured notetaking systems had a negative influence on participants’ effectiveness in reusing information artifacts in their individual synthesis work . A common consequence of these systems was an increase in difficulties for participants when attempting to retrieve the desired information artifacts . On the low structure end , P4 mentioned that his messy file management system prevented him from finding a specific paper , saying , “I have a papers folder on my computer , that is a mess . ” Similarly , P14 had too many related documents which make made his system less structured and hard 329 Exploring Distributed Synthesis CSCW ’23 Companion , October 14 – 18 , 2023 , Minneapolis , MN , USA Table 1 : Participants’ Tools Used for Synthesis and Their Research Directions ID Tools Used Synthesis Research Direction / Questions P01 Bear 2 novel software interface that can support cognition and creativity P02 Apple Notes video games as a medium for communication P03 Logseq 3 political and economic liberty from a Buddhist perspective P04 PDF readers , Blog , Ulysses 4 tacit knowledge and mental models P05 RoamResearch 5 types of graph visualization in note - taking applications P06 Logseq laws in Central American countries P07 Bear / Figma visualization of infinite sets of different sizes in the mathematical sense .

I don’t know which is which . ” On the other hand , P11 had elaborate tagging and naming sys - tems , such as long reading lists with tags and abstracts . Despite this , they reported that this system was still insufficient , saying , “I haven’t found a great solution that like I could put a lot of work into trying to tag them . ” . Elaborating on this , P11 complained , “They get buried . I’ll never find them again . ” . Similarly , P12 set too many hier - archical levels in his management system . As a result , his system became overly structured and hindered his retrieval process . He elaborated , “Like I was constantly reshuffling where these drafts were and like burying them under multiple levels of hierarchy and like my Notions . ” 3 . 2 Sharing in collaborative synthesis In contrast to what was observed when participants discussed their workflows for individual synthesis , successful ( and , more com - monly , unsuccessful ) sharing in collaborative synthesis work was more frequently associated with broader shared background knowl - edge and skills with collaborators ( or the lack thereof ) . For example , P8 mentioned that it is challenging for him to share his thoughts using his visualized maps with people who don’t possess similar skillsets . P8 gained the skills of synthesizing at multiple levels which is different from his collaborators , mentioning “Miro supercharged my learning journey into being able to create multiple levels compared to people in amplitude . ” Adding to this , P8 explained that the gaps were produced because his collaborators don’t practice the same tools and methods , explaining , “Because they don’t practice this all day . This was very difficult for them . ” Therefore , the artifacts that P8 created were difficult to share with his collaborators , saying , “There’s a huge problem that one thing could be associated with multi - ple things . Like that was like , a problem for them . ” P10 also described how his information artifacts are hard to share to somebody do not have the same level of experiences with the same type of informa - tion artifacts , saying , “How do I take this sort of , you know , rather boring looking outline , which I know quite well , because I’ve been working on this on and off for years but share it with somebody else . ” 4 DISCUSSION 4 . 1 Initial Implication : Reuse by self vs . others While our findings are still in progress , a theme of a contrast be - tween reuse by self vs . others in the synthesis process is emerging as interesting from both a design perspective as well as a potential contribution to CSCW more generally . As discussed in our intro - duction , past research on scholarly synthesis work has identified the non - linear process of reusing information artifacts as typical ; however , our findings suggest that the notion of " reuse " in this sense may be substantially different from the notion of reuse in more classical CSCW work on organizational memory and knowledge sharing , which typically refers to sharing information between dif - ferent individuals ( reuse by others ) [ 1 ] . To clarify this distinction in our work , we use the term " reuse " here to refer to reuse by self ( i . e . , for individual synthesis work ) , and " sharing " to refer to reuse by others ( i . e . , in collaborative synthesis work ) . Our in - progress findings suggest that reusing and sharing are distinct scenarios within the synthesis process , each with different material requirements to be successful . The details of required con - textual information differ for reusing and sharing : in the reusing process , synthesis failures often occur due to a lack of cues to re - trieve previous lines of thinking . This is consistent with some prior studies of reuse in knowledge work [ 18 , 37 ] . In contrast , failures of sharing primarily stem from differences in background knowledge and skills among individuals . This is also consistent with themes from prior studies of sharing knowledge in collaborative work set - tings [ 1 ] . Yet , we could frame reusing and sharing as facing a common chal - lenge in current synthesis practices : the need to retrieve appropriate contextual information alongside primary material for synthesis : in the individual case , it is things like cues to previous thinking , 330 CSCW ’23 Companion , October 14 – 18 , 2023 , Minneapolis , MN , USA Zhu and Chan and in the collaborative case , it is related information about struc - ture / conventions and background knowledge . Further , we reason that information ( along with their contextual information ) that cannot be retrieved for individual reuse also cannot be shared with others . Thus , one interesting point to ponder is whether the in - formation artifact management structures that enable retrieval of contextual information may also be repurposed or integrated into systems for retrieving contextual information to accompany shar - ing of information artifacts with others , either in collaborative settings , or in more distributed synthesis networks . We are curi - ous whether these information management structures could be further enhanced with technological mechanisms , such as ( semi - ) automated tagging , enhanced search or question - answering sys - tems ( e . g . , with large language models ) , or contextual computing and modeling . 4 . 2 Next Steps We plan to augment our current findings by more deeply com - paring reusing and sharing behavior in participants’ workflows of synthesis . First , we want to identify what type of information artifacts and participants’ behaviors support and differentiate suc - cessful reusing and sharing . Second , we want to investigate at which stage of participants’ workflows synthesis is more capable of be - ing translated to a distributed way and integrated with distributed synthesis systems . Our diverse sample also presents the need ( and opportunity ) to understand how the challenges and requirements of reuse / sharing may vary systematically within the sample ; for example , we are noticing some variations in synthesis orientation ( focused on relatively well - structured problems , vs . open - ended , ill - structured problems ) . Finally , we want to aggregate our study findings to inform a roadmap for successful synthesis systems .
