We hypothesize that participants from higher status socio - demographic groups may be more likely to report stigmatizing attitudes than participants from lower status socio - demographic groups . We find support for our hypothesis using multiple linear regression . Participants who were college - educated , male , or had household incomes above the national median were more likely to report stigmatizing attitudes toward both AMI and SUD in comparison to participants that were not college - educated , were female , or had household incomes below the national median . In contrast to our hypothesis , we find that participants who identified as Hispanic were more likely to report stigmatizing attitudes toward AMI than non - Hispanic whites . Younger and urban participants were more likely to report stigmatizing attitudes than their older and non - urban counterparts . Keywords Mental illness · Stigma · Social determinants of health · Socio - demographics · Substance use · United States Introduction Over 20 % of American adults ( 55 . 4 million ) reported experi - encing behavioral health issues , including any mental illness ( AMI ) or substance use disorder ( SUD ) in 2016 ( Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration , 2017 ) . Despite this high rate , stigma towards individuals experienc - ing behavioral health issues remains pervasive ( Pescosolido , 2013 ) . Stigma can be defined as the devaluing of an indi - vidual that possesses attributes that are outside of cultural or social expectations ( Goffman , 1986 ) . In the case of behavio - ral health , stigma often takes the form of attitudes labeling individuals experiencing AMI and / or SUD as dangerous , deviant , lazy , and / or untrustworthy ( Jorm et al . , 2012 ; Pes - cosolido et al . , 1999 ) . Most research on behavioral health stigma explores impacts of stigmatizing attitudes on stigmatized individuals , as such beliefs can lead to a variety of deleterious outcomes for individuals experiencing behavioral health issues includ - ing discrimination , financial decline , rejection , and status loss ( Link & Phelan , 2001 ) . Stigmatizing attitudes often fuel personal feelings of shame for individuals experiencing AMI or SUD which inhibit them from seeking treatment ( Chandra & Minkovitz , 2006 ; Conner et al . , 2010 ; Corrigan , 2004 ) , ultimately leading to worse behavioral health outcomes ( Mak et al . , 2007 ) . Because of the far - reaching impacts of stigma , it has been considered a fundamental cause of health inequalities ( Hatzenbuehler et al . , 2013 ; Link & Hatzenbue - hler , 2016 ) . While much is known about individuals with AMI or SUD who experience others’ stigmatizing attitudes , fewer studies have explored the characteristics of individuals that hold stigmatizing attitudes . One characteristic possi - bly associated with stigmatizing attitudes is socio - demo - graphic group membership . Individuals from shared race , class , gender , educational , and geographic groups undergo socialization processes through which they learn domi - nant cultural norms and expectations aligned with their socio - demographic group ( Mead & Morris , 1967 ) . In the case of behavioral health , members of groups with strong * Paula K .

Whether an individual develops stigmatizing attitudes is likely influenced by the status of the socio - demographic groups of which they are a member ( Phelan et al . , 2014 ) . Members of higher status groups often have access to more ideological and material resources than members of lower status groups ( Ridgeway , 1991 ) and may use these resources to construct and maintain narratives about AMI and SUD that serve to benefit their group at the expense of members of lower status groups ( Scheff , 1974 ) . For example , members of higher status groups may use their influence to normalize the behavioral health expectations of their group , while pathologizing the behavioral health expectations of lower status groups ( Phelan et al . , 2008 ) . In addition , members of higher status groups may use their influence to determine who qualifies for resources inte - gral to AMI and SUD treatment and prevention , including financial support , health care benefits , high - quality reha - bilitation facilities , and professional therapy ( Link et al . , 1989 ) . Consequently , members of higher status groups are more easily able to ascribe to dominant behavioral health norms , reducing their likelihood to be stigmatized by others , and emboldening them to develop stigmatizing attitudes towards individuals experiencing AMI or SUD ( Link & Phelan , 2014 ) . As previous research has demon - strated that higher status socio - demographic groups are most often comprised of individuals who are male , white , higher income , or more highly educated ( Johnson , 2001 ) , it is feasible that members of these groups may be more likely to report stigmatizing attitudes than their lower sta - tus counterparts . Understanding which socio - demographic groups are more likely to report stigmatizing attitudes is important as these attitudes cultivate a social hierarchy of behavioral health that justifies the devaluing and discrimination of individuals who do not meet the behavioral health expectations set forth by members of more dominant socio - demographic groups . Individuals who experience AMI or SUD who are also mem - bers of lower status socio - demographic groups are likely to experience ‘double stigma’ ( Gary , 2005 ) , placing them in particular need of behavioral health supports . Individu - als at the top of this hierarchy would be especially served by targeted mental health literacy programs that work to reduce stigmatizing attitudes towards individuals with AMI or SUD . Despite these strong theoretical foundations for under - standing why socio - demographic group membership is a likely correlate of stigmatizing attitudes towards AMI and SUD , existing empirical research is limited , and often focuses on one facet of socio - demographic group member - ship or behavioral health issue . Prior studies are not nation - ally representative , and demonstrate inconclusive results , as shown in Table 1 . We explore whether socio - demographic group member - ship influences stigmatizing attitudes towards AMI and SUD in a national sample of U . S . adults ( N = 2512 ) . We hypothe - size that individuals who are members of socio - demographic groups associated with higher status will be more likely to report stigmatizing attitudes than members of socio - demo - graphic groups that have been shown to have less status . Table 1 Studies of socio - demographic group membership and stigma This table represents general patterns in the reported research data for each group membership category and is not necessarily inclusive of each socio - demographic response category included in the reported research Group membership More stigma reported Less stigma reported No association with stigma Younger respondents ( vs . older respondents ) ( Peluso & Blay , 2009 ; Reavley et al . , 2012 ) ( Golberstein et al . , 2008 ) College educated respondents ( vs . non - college educated respondents ) ( Ojeda & Bergstresser , 2008 ) ( Corrigan & Watson , 2007 ; Reavley et al . , 2012 ) ( Jorm & Oh , 2009 ) White respondents ( vs .

Female respondents ) ( Chandra & Minkovitz , 2006 ; Cor - rigan & Watson , 2007 ; Golberstein et al . , 2008 ; Ojeda & Bergstresser , 2008 ; Reavley et al . , 2012 ) ( Jorm & Oh , 2009 ) Urban respondents ( vs . suburban and rural respondents ) ( Jones et al . , 2011 ; Stewart et al . , 2015 ) ( Griffiths et al . , 2008 ) Higher income respondents ( vs . lower income respondents ) ( Ojeda & Bergstresser , 2008 ) ( Golberstein et al . , 2008 ) ( Holman , 2015 ) 251 Community Mental Health Journal ( 2022 ) 58 : 249 – 260 1 3 Methods Design and Sample The study data were collected from the Community Assess - ment and Education to Promote Behavioral Health Planning and Evaluation ( CAPE ) National Behavioral Health Survey ( N = 2512 ) , a national set of four surveys focused on depres - sion , anxiety , alcohol abuse , and prescription drug misuse ( PDM ) . Each respondent was randomly selected to com - plete a survey about one of these four topics . Depression and anxiety are among the most common forms of AMI ( Kessler et al . , 2005 ; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration , 2017 ) , while alcohol abuse and PDM are among the most common forms of SUD ( Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration , 2017 ) . Surveys were distributed in July 2016 , using Survey Sample Inter - national ( SSI ) , an online survey platform that maintains a large opt - in panel representative of the U . S . population . The national samples were balanced on age , gender , income and region . Table 2 presents characteristics of the study sample . The survey presented the respondent with a vignette describing an individual with symptoms commonly associated with one of four behavioral health issues . For example , respondents who received surveys that included the depression vignette stated that the person being described had been ‘feeling unusually sad and miserable for the last few weeks . ’ These vignettes were modelled on Jorm et al . ’s ( 1997 ) method of measuring mental health literacy in Aus - tralia and constructed around DSM - IV criteria . Vignettes were selected for this survey to avoid stigma from diagnostic labelling ( Scheff , 1974 ) , as the vignettes did not name the condition ( e . g . depression ) described in the scenario . After reading the vignette , respondents were asked to report their agreement with a variety of stigmatizing attitudes ( Griffiths et al . , 2004 ) . Measures Stigmatizing Attitudes We use measures of stigmatizing attitudes previously vali - dated by Griffiths et al . ( 2008 ) and Griffiths et al . ( 2006 ) . Stigmatizing attitudes were grouped into two scales that have been validated in numerous studies ( Griffiths et al . , 2006 , 2008 ) and have consistently demonstrated internal reliability above 0 . 7 . The first scale , labelled personal stigma , meas - ures the level of stigma participants reported toward an indi - vidual experiencing the behavioral health issue described in their vignette . The second scale , labelled perceived stigma , measures the level of stigma participants reported that they thought their community would hold toward an individual experiencing the behavioral health issue described in their vignette . The items used to measure personal and perceived stigma were virtually identical , except that the items meas - uring personal stigma asked respondents about their own beliefs , while the items measuring perceived stigma asked respondents what ‘most in [ their ] community believe . ’ Respondents chose from five possible response options for each stigma survey item , ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree . To reduce the number of missing values , all valid responses for personal and perceived stigma were respectively summed and then divided by the number of valid responses to create two separate scales , one reflecting personal , and the other reflecting perceived stigma . Both scales range from 1 to 5 , with higher values indicating the presence of more stigmatizing attitudes . The correlation between the personal stigma and perceived stigma scales was 0 . 481 . Table 3 presents questions measuring personal and perceived stigma . We use these measures instead of alternate measures such as social distance ( Link et al . , 1987 ) to include questions about respondents’ perceptions of the cultural norms around behavioral health issues in their community . In addition , we used these measures as previous studies have found that socio - demographic group membership is a key correlate of Table 2 Descriptive statistics for socio - demographic variables Age 18 – 34 years 31 . 9 % 35 – 54 years 36 . 2 % 55 and older 31 . 9 % Education Not college graduate 55 . 5 % College graduate 45 . 5 % Race - ethnicity White non - Hispanic 83 % Black non - Hispanic 7 . 9 % Hispanic 3 . 8 % Other non - Hispanic 5 . 3 % Gender Male 43 . 2 % Female 56 . 8 % Urbanicity Urban 35 . 3 % Suburban 36 . 6 % Rural 28 . 1 % Income Less than $ 49 , 999 44 . 9 % $ 50 , 000 and above 55 . 1 % Experience with behav - ioral health issue Yes 49 . 4 % No 50 . 6 % N 2512 252 Community Mental Health Journal ( 2022 ) 58 : 249 – 260 1 3 personal and perceived stigma in Australia and Japan ( Grif - fiths et al . , 2004 , 2006 , 2008 ) , but these relationships have not been studied in the United States . Socio‑Demographic Group Membership Categories for socio - demographic group membership were based on previous research , with an emphasis on includ - ing variables of interest that were the most studied and had previously produced conflicting results in relation to stigmatizing attitudes ( see Table 1 ) . Categorization of socio - demographic indicators into higher and lower status groups was based on research that group members who are college educated , male , white , or who have higher incomes comprise a higher status group than individuals who have less than a college degree , are female , non - white , or who have lower incomes ( Johnson , 2001 ) . While age and urbanicity do not have clear relationships with status , we included both of these as potential socio - demographic cor - relates , given findings showing these indicators influence individuals’ stigmatizing attitudes ( Griffiths et al . , 2008 ; Peluso & Blay , 2009 ; Reavley et al . , 2012 ) . Respondents selected their age by 5 - year categories that we collapsed into 18 – 34 , 35 – 43 , and 55 + years . Respond - ents provided information on their highest level of educa - tion , selecting less than high school , high school gradu - ate , 2 - year college degree , 4 - year college degree , master’s degree , professional degree , or doctoral degree . Educa - tion was dichotomized into completion of at least a 4 - year college degree or not . Respondents provided information about their race - ethnicity by selecting whether they identi - fied as non - Hispanic white , non - Hispanic Black , Hispanic , and non - Hispanic other . Gender was determined through the use of male and female response options . Respond - ents selected their urbanicity by choosing between urban , suburban , and rural . Household income category responses were recoded into a binary variable , at or above $ 50 , 000 - $ 75 , 000 , or below , reflecting the national median income at the time of our survey ( Noss , 2013 ) . Experience with Behavioral Health Issue We controlled for individuals’ experience with the behavio - ral health issue detailed in the vignette , as those who have experience with AMI or SUD tend to report less stigma than with no experience ( Corrigan et al . , 2001 ) . We measured experience with the issue through a question that asked ‘Has anyone in your family or a close friend ever experienced ( depression , anxiety , alcohol abuse , or PDM ) ? ’ Response options were yes or no . Missing Data An analysis of missing data was performed on all variables . Most variables were missing less than 5 % of responses , indi - cating the responses were missing at random and that their effect does not have an impact on the data analysis or results ( Tabachnick & Fidell , 2013 ) . The only exception to this was the perceived stigma scale variable , which was missing 7 % of responses . Research has demonstrated that variables with fewer than 10 % missing data are still reliable and unbiased ( Dong & Peng , 2013 ) . To further ensure this , we explored whether there were any patterns to our missing data , and found there were no significant correlations between any of the missing responses in our dataset . In addition , there were no extreme outliers . Given this information , we followed the recommended guideline of performing multiple imputation using the mean to maintain the strongest sample size and to reduce bias ( Cokluk & Kayri , 2011 ) . Descriptive statistics for each of these variables are in Table 2 . Table 3 Stigma questions Respondents were randomly assigned surveys with the names Michael and Michelle ( denoted here as M ) to control for possible sex bias . No sig - nificant differences in responses by sex were found Personal stigma Perceived stigma People with a problem like M’s could snap out of it if they wanted Most other people in my community believe that people with a problem like M’s could snap out of it if they wanted A problem like M’s is a sign of personal weakness Most people in my community believe that a problem like M’s is a sign of personal weakness M’s problem is not a real medical illness Most people in my community believe that M’s problem is not a real medical illness It is best to avoid people with a problem like M’s so that you don’t develop this problem Most people in my community believe it is best to avoid people with a problem like M’s so you don’t develop it I would not employ someone if I knew they had had a problem like ‘s in the past Most people in my community would not employ someone if they knew they had a problem like M’s in the past 253 Community Mental Health Journal ( 2022 ) 58 : 249 – 260 1 3 Analytic Strategy Initial analysis was completed using one - way ANOVAs to compare differences in means for personal and perceived stigma by behavioral health issue . Tukey post - hoc tests were also conducted to determine whether these differences in means were significant . We report F statistics and Eta - squared to demonstrate statistically significant differences between groups . We use multiple linear regression to assess whether respondents’ socio - demographic group member - ship was associated with their reported levels of stigmatiz - ing attitudes towards depression , anxiety , PDM , and alcohol abuse . Multiple linear regression was selected , as our models contain multiple independent variables , a dependent vari - able that includes five response options that are normally distributed , and the data comes from a large national sample . Therefore , we follow the practice of treating our dependent variable as continuous ( Cohen et al . , 2003 ) . Our data met all assumptions for multiple linear regression , including linear - ity , no multi - collinearity , statistical independence of errors , and homoscedasticity . Analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Version 24 , with p value set at ≤ 0 . 05 . Results Mean responses for reported levels of personal and per - ceived stigma for each of the four behavioral health issues are in Table 4 , along with two internal consistency measures for each stigma scale . Higher scores indicate the presence of more stigmatizing attitudes . There was a statistically significant difference in reports of personal stigma by the behavioral health issue in the vignette as determined by one - way ANOVA ( F ( 3 , 2508 ) = 6 . 81 , p = 0 . 000 , η 2 = 0 . 037 ) . A Tukey post hoc test revealed that participants reported higher levels of per - sonal stigma for alcohol abuse ( 2 . 56 ± 0 . 963 , p = 0 . 001 ) and PDM ( 2 . 56 ± 1 . 01 , p = 0 . 001 ) in comparison with depres - sion ( 2 . 33 ± 1 . 07 ) . There was no statistically significant dif - ference in reports of personal stigma between depression and anxiety ( p = 0 . 346 ) , anxiety and alcohol abuse ( p = 0 . 139 ) , anxiety and PDM ( p = 0 . 141 ) , or alcohol abuse and PDM ( p = 1 . 00 ) . There were also statistically significant differences in the mean reporting of perceived stigma by behavioral health issue as determined by one - way ANOVA ( F ( 3 , 2508 ) = 9 . 94 , p = 0 . 000 , η 2 = 0 . 012 ) . A Tukey post hoc test revealed that perceived stigma was significantly lower for depres - sion ( 3 . 14 ± 0 . 934 , p = 0 . 000 ) , anxiety ( 3 . 13 ± 0 . 937 , p = 0 . 000 ) , and alcohol abuse ( 3 . 24 ± 0 . 850 , p = 0 . 034 ) in comparison with PDM ( 3 . 39 ± 0 . 852 ) . There were no sta - tistically significant differences in perceived stigma between depression and anxiety ( p = 0 . 994 ) , depression and alcohol abuse ( p = 0 . 260 ) , and anxiety and alcohol abuse ( p = 0 . 158 ) . Internal reliability was determined using both Cronbach’s Alpha and McDonald’s Omega ( Dunn et al . , 2014 ; McNeish , 2018 ) for each of the five items included in the personal stigma scale , and for each of the five items included in the perceived stigma scale . These coefficients were above 0 . 8 , indicating the items included to measure personal and perceived stigma scale together well ( Tavakol & Dennick , 2011 ) . Analysis on the Correlates of Personal Stigma In our first set of regression models , we measured the asso - ciation between a variety of socio - demographic correlates and the stigmatizing attitudes participants reported toward an individual experiencing the behavioral health issue described in their vignette ( personal stigma ) , by behavioral health category , the results of which can be seen in Table 5 . Higher personal stigma scores indicate the presence of more stigmatizing attitudes . The socio - demographic correlates explained approxi - mately 25 % of the variation in responses for personal stigma towards depression , anxiety , and PDM , while explaining about 14 % of the variation in the responses for personal stigma towards alcohol abuse . Age emerged as a significant correlate across all four surveys , with younger respond - ents being more likely to report personal stigma than older respondents ( p ≤ 0 . 01 ) . College graduates reported signifi - cantly more personal stigma than non - college graduates towards depression ( p ≤ 0 . 01 ) . Respondents identifying as Hispanic were significantly more likely to report per - sonal stigma towards depression than non - Hispanic whites ( p ≤ 0 . 01 ) . All other racial - ethnic groups reported similar levels of personal stigma toward all four behavioral health issues in comparison with whites . Males were significantly more likely to report personal stigma than females across all four behavioral health surveys ( p ≤ 0 . 01 ) . Urban respondents Table 4 Descriptive statistics for personal and perceived stigma scales Means , standard deviations , and internal consistency scores were rounded to the nearest hundredth DepressionN = 628 AnxietyN = 627 Alcohol abuse N = 626 Prescription drug misuse N = 631 Personal stigma Alpha : . 88 Omega : . 84 2 . 33 ( 1 . 09 ) 2 . 43 ( 1 . 08 ) 2 . 56 ( . 97 ) 2 . 56 ( 1 . 03 ) Perceived stigma Alpha : . 87 Omega : . 85 3 . 14 ( . 98 ) 3 . 13 ( . 97 ) 3 . 24 ( . 88 ) 3 . 39 ( . 89 ) 254 Community Mental Health Journal ( 2022 ) 58 : 249 – 260 1 3 were more likely to report personal stigma across all four behavioral health surveys in comparison with suburban and rural respondents ( p ≤ 0 . 01 ) . Respondents with higher levels of income were significantly more likely to report personal stigma towards anxiety and PDM ( p ≤ 0 . 05 ) , but not depres - sion and alcohol abuse . We tested for interactions by race - ethnicity and income , income and gender , and race - ethnicity and gender . However , these interaction terms were not sig - nificant and decreased model fit , and therefore , were not included in our final regression models . Finally , respondents who did not have any experience with depression , anxiety , and alcohol abuse were significantly more likely to report personal stigma toward these issues ( p ≤ 0 . 05 ) . Analysis on the Correlates of Perceived Stigma We examined the association between socio - demographic group status and the level of stigmatizing attitudes partici - pants reported that they thought their community would hold toward an individual experiencing the behavioral health issue described in their vignette ( perceived stigma ) in our second set of regression models . The results of this analysis are in Table 6 . Higher perceived stigma scores indicate the presence of more stigmatizing attitudes . The socio - demographic correlates explained 7 – 10 % of the variation in responses for perceived stigma towards depression , anxiety , and PDM . Age emerged as a sig - nificant correlate across all four surveys , with younger respondents reporting more perceived stigma than older respondents ( p ≤ 0 . 05 ) . Respondents with a college degree were significantly more likely to report perceived stigma towards depression , anxiety , and PDM than those with who had not completed college ( p ≤ 0 . 05 ) . Race - ethnicity did not impact perceived stigma towards any of the four behavioral health issues . Males were sig - nificantly more likely to report perceived stigma than females when completing surveys with a depression or anxiety vignette ( p ≤ 0 . 05 ) , but reported similar levels of perceived stigma for vignettes related to alcohol abuse and PDM . Urban respondents were more likely to report perceived stigma towards anxiety and PDM than sub - urban and rural respondents ( p ≤ 0 . 05 ) . Income did not influence perceived stigma . We tested for interactions by race - ethnicity and income , income and gender , and race - ethnicity and gender , but they were not significant and decreased model fit , so were not included in our final regression models . Finally , respondents who reported that they did not have any experience with any of the four Table 5 Multiple linear regressions of socio - demographic predictors on personal stigma , by behavioral health category [ 95 percent CI ] CI = confidence interval * p ≤ . 05 . ; * * p ≤ . 01 ; * * * p ≤ . 001 Depression ( N = 627 ) Anxiety ( N = 627 ) Alcohol abuse ( N = 626 ) Prescription drug misuse ( N = 631 ) Age ( 0 = 18 – 34 years ) 35 – 54 years − . 29 * * [ − . 47 , − . 11 ] − . 35 * * * [ − . 52 , − . 17 ] − . 30 * * [ − . 48 , − . 13 ] − . 33 * * * [ − . 50 , − . 16 ] 55 years or older − . 68 * * * [ − . 88 , − . 49 ] − . 73 * * * [ − . 92 , − . 55 ] − . 55 * * * [ − . 73 , − . 37 ] − . 69 * * * [ − . 87 , − . 51 ] Education ( 0 = non - graduate ) College graduate . 21 * * [ . 05 , . 37 ] . 09 [ − . 07 , . 25 ] . 05 [ − . 11 , . 22 ] . 05 [ − . 11 , . 21 ] Race - ethnicity ( 0 = white non - Hispanic ) Black non - Hispanic . 16 [ − . 15 , . 46 ] − . 03 [ − . 31 , . 25 ] . 09 [ − . 14 , . 32 ] . 07 [ − . 22 , . 36 ] Hispanic . 46 * * [ . 11 , . 82 ] − . 06 [ − . 41 , . 29 ] − . 10 [ − . 53 , . 34 ] − . 01 [ − . 41 , . 39 ] Other non - Hispanic . 26 [ − . 08 , . 60 ] − . 26 [ − . 60 , . 08 ] − . 09 [ − . 40 , . 22 ] . 29 [ − . 01 , . 60 ] Gender ( 0 = male ) Female − . 44 * * * [ − . 59 , − . 29 ] − . 40 * * * [ − . 55 , − . 24 ] − . 26 * * [ − . 40 , − . 11 ] − . 46 * * * [ − . 60 , − . 31 ] Urbanicity ( 0 = urban ) Suburban − . 41 * * * [ − . 59 , − . 23 ] − . 54 * * * [ − . 72 , − . 37 ] − . 23 * * [ − . 41 , − . 06 ] − . 41 * * * [ − . 58 , − . 24 ] Rural − . 27 * * * [ − . 47 , − . 06 ] − . 62 * * * [ − . 82 , − . 43 ] − . 28 * * [ − . 47 , − . 10 ] − . 34 * * * [ − . 54 , − . 15 ] Income ( 0 = less than $ 49 , 999 ) $ 50 , 000 and above . 10 [ − . 06 , . 26 ] . 18 * [ . 02 , . 34 ] . 16 [ − . 001 , . 314 ] . 23 * * [ . 07 , . 38 ] Experience with issue ( 0 = yes ) No . 35 * * * [ . 20 , . 50 ] . 18 * [ . 04 , . 33 ] . 19 * [ . 043 , . 34 ] − . 01 [ − . 16 , . 14 ] Constant 2 . 77 * * * [ 2 . 54 , 2 . 99 ] 3 . 18 * * * [ 2 . 96 , 3 . 40 ] 2 . 97 * * * [ 2 . 75 , 3 . 19 ] 3 . 25 * * * [ 3 . 02 , 3 . 48 ] Adjusted R2 . 25 . 27 . 14 . 24 255 Community Mental Health Journal ( 2022 ) 58 : 249 – 260 1 3 behavioral health issues we measured were significantly less likely to report perceived stigma towards these same issues ( p ≤ 0 . 05 ) . Discussion We hypothesized that individuals from higher status socio - demographic groups may be more likely to report stigmatiz - ing attitudes towards AMI and SUD than individuals from lower status socio - demographic groups . Our findings con - firm this assumption in regard to college education , gender , and income , but complicate it in regard to race - ethnicity . In addition , we found that respondents who were younger and resided in urban areas were more likely to report stig - matizing attitudes than individuals who were older or from non - urban areas . Education College graduates were more likely to report stigmatizing attitudes towards AMI and SUD than non - college gradu - ates . In particular , college graduates were more likely to report personal stigma towards depression , and perceived stigma towards depression , anxiety , and PDM . These find - ings complicate research that suggests that education is an important pathway to more critical thinking about a variety of issues , including behavioral health ( Martin et al . , 2000 ) . Institutions of higher education often offer services such as free counselling , support groups , free or low - cost health care programs that include access to primary care physicians and psychiatrists , and drug prevention and treatment programs that work to decrease behavioral health stigma ( Hunt & Eisenberg , 2010 ) . Yet , our findings suggest that potentially better access to such programs does not always translate to fewer stigmatizing attitudes in this population . Our findings support existing research that college students are more likely to hold stigmatizing attitudes ( Ojeda & Bergstresser , 2008 ) and contests research that has found that college stu - dents are less likely to hold stigmatizing attitudes ( Corrigan & Watson , 2007 ; Reavley et al . , 2012 ) . Gender Males were more likely to report stigmatizing attitudes towards AMI and SUD than females . These differential norms may be due to more stigma for men as they experience Table 6 Multiple linear regressions of socio - demographic predictors on perceived stigma , by behavioral health category [ 95 percent CI ] CI = confidence interval * p ≤ . 05 . ; * * p ≤ . 01 ; * * * p ≤ . 001 Depression ( N = 627 ) Anxiety ( N = 627 ) Alcohol abuse ( N = 626 ) Prescription drug misuse ( N = 631 ) Age ( 0 = 18 – 34 years ) 35 – 54 years − . 16 [ − . 34 , . 01 ] − . 24 * * [ − . 41 , − . 07 ] − . 19 * [ − . 35 , − . 03 ] − . 19 * [ − . 35 , − . 04 ] 55 years or older − . 53 * * * [ − . 72 , − . 35 ] − . 44 * * * [ − . 62 , − . 25 ] − . 49 * * * [ − . 65 , − . 32 ] − . 52 * * * [ − . 69 , − . 36 ] Education ( 0 = non - graduate ) College graduate . 23 * * [ . 07 , . 38 ] . 16 * [ . 10 , . 32 ] . 11 [ − . 04 , . 27 ] . 19 * * [ . 05 , . 33 ] Race - ethnicity ( 0 = white non - Hispanic ) Black non - Hispanic − . 14 [ − . 43 , . 16 ] − . 08 [ − . 35 , . 20 ] − . 06 [ − . 27 , . 15 ] − . 16 [ − . 43 , . 10 ] Hispanic . 04 [ − . 30 , . 38 ] − . 02 [ − . 35 , . 32 ] − . 26 [ − . 66 , . 15 ] − . 11 [ − . 48 , . 25 ] Other non - Hispanic . 17 [ − . 16 , . 49 ] − . 11 [ − . 44 , . 22 ] − . 09 [ − . 37 , . 20 ] . 02 [ − . 26 , . 30 ] Gender ( 0 = male ) Female − . 15 * [ − . 30 , − . 01 ] − . 18 * [ − . 33 , − . 03 ] − . 09 [ − . 23 , . 04 ] − . 05 [ − . 18 , . 09 ] Urbanicity ( 0 = urban ) Suburban − . 12 [ − . 29 , . 05 ] − . 26 * * [ − . 44 , − . 09 ] − . 02 [ − . 18 , . 14 ] − . 18 * [ − . 33 , − . 02 ] Rural − . 03 [ − . 23 , . 16 ] − . 21 * [ − . 40 , − . 02 ] . 03 [ − . 15 , . 20 ] − . 18 * [ − . 36 , − . 01 ] Income ( 0 = less than $ 49 , 999 ) $ 50 , 000 and above − . 09 [ − . 25 , . 06 ] . 14 [ − . 02 , . 29 ] . 13 [ − . 01 , . 28 ] − . 09 [ − . 24 , . 05 ] Experience with issue ( 0 = yes ) No − . 16 * [ − . 30 , − . 02 ] − . 21 * * [ − . 35 , − . 06 ] − . 19 * * [ − . 32 , − . 05 ] − . 18 * * [ − . 32 , − . 05 ] Constant 3 . 53 * * * [ 3 . 31 , 3 . 75 ] 3 . 57 * * * [ 3 . 35 , 3 . 78 ] 3 . 50 * * * [ 3 . 30 , 3 . 70 ] 3 . 88 * * * [ 3 . 67 , 4 . 08 ] Adjusted R2 . 09 . 10 . 07 . 10 256 Community Mental Health Journal ( 2022 ) 58 : 249 – 260 1 3 behavioral health issues due to social norms around mas - culine independence and emotional toughness ( Judd et al . , 2008 ) . Our findings support existing research that men con - sistently demonstrate higher levels of stigmatizing attitudes than women ( Chandra & Minkovitz , 2006 ) and contradicts research that gender is not correlated to stigmatizing atti - tudes ( Jorm & Oh , 2009 ) . Income Participants with higher incomes were more likely to report personal stigma toward anxiety and PDM than those with lower incomes . This finding indicates that groups from more privileged class statuses may be more likely to have strict meanings and social rules about AMI and SUD than those from lower status groups . In regard to PDM , it may be that higher income individuals have financial means to routinely consume legal substances , and therefore develop stricter boundaries around PDM as a face - saving measure ( Goffman , 1955 ) . Alternately , PDM might be associated with social problems such as homelessness and criminality ( Inciardi et al . , 2007 ) , leading higher income individuals to stigmatize it . Our findings support previous studies that have found that individuals with higher incomes are more likely to report stigmatizing attitudes ( Ojeda & Bergstresser , 2008 ) and counter Holman’s ( 2015 ) research showing no correla - tion between income and stigmatizing attitudes . Age Adults aged 18 – 34 were more likely to report personal and perceived stigma across all four behavioral health surveys . Younger individuals may feel less secure , with limited social status , and therefore exercise more caution with respect to social boundaries than more established ( older ) individu - als ( Musgrove , 2002 ) . It also may be true that due to less life experience , younger individuals are less likely to have known people who have recovered from these conditions , due simply to the fact that recovery takes time . Our findings support previous research arguing that younger individu - als are more likely to hold stigmatizing attitudes ( Peluso & Blay , 2009 ; Reavley et al . , 2012 ) , but contest Golberstein et al . ( 2008 ) , who report the opposite . Urbanicity Our urban respondents were more likely to report personal stigma across all four behavioral health categories and more likely to report perceived stigma toward anxiety and PDM than rural or suburban respondents . Although urban group members do not necessarily comprise a higher sta - tus group than those that are non - urban , there are alternate explanations to why these groups reported more stigma . Urban residents are less likely to know most or all of their neighbours than non - urban residents ( Parker , 2018 ) , which has been shown to decrease stigma towards AMI and SUD ( Phelan et al . , 2008 ) . Another explanation may be that urban residents’ more routine exposure to visible homelessness in their community negatively colours their attitudes towards AMI and SUD , as severe mental illness is approximately four times more prevalent among homeless people than the general population ( National Coalition for the Homeless , 2007 ) . Our findings regarding urbanicity counter previous research that has found higher levels of stigmatizing atti - tudes in rural areas ( Stewart et al . , 2015 ) , and lower stigma - tizing attitudes among urban populations ( Jones et al . , 2011 ) . Race and Ethnicity Hispanic participants were more likely to report personal stigma towards depression than whites . This finding con - tradicts our hypothesis that members of higher status socio - demographic groups would report more stigmatizing attitudes than members of lower status socio - demographic groups . However , our findings support existing research , which has found that compared to whites , Black , Indig - enous , and People of Color ( BIPOC ) often perceive peo - ple with mental illness as more dangerous ( Anglin et al . , 2006 ) and are also more likely to place more emphasis on the rhetoric of self - reliance , which constructs behavio - ral health issues as a sign of personal weakness ( Alegria et al . , 2007 ) . BIPOC may use stigma as a way of counter - ing the marginalization they already experience in a white supremacist system ( Bonilla - Silva , 2001 ) . In particular , mental illness may give the appearance of making a group ‘weaker’ or more susceptible to criticism by a privileged group . For members of lower status racial - ethnic groups , the added component of experiencing mental health and / or substance use issues could be seen as threatening to their already marginalized status . Together , these patterns create a confluence of events that would be expected to increase stigmatizing attitudes towards behavioral health issues for BIPOC . Most research has confirmed this relationship , find - ing that BIPOC are more likely to report stigmatizing atti - tudes in comparison with whites ( Hsu et al . , 2008 ; Kobau et al . , 2010 ) . Limitations The primary limitation to this research is that the stigma items we used were originally developed to measure stig - matizing attitudes related only to depression . However , many of these questions reflect themes found in stigma scales that have been used to measure other behavioral health issues , including anxiety , alcohol abuse , and PDM . In addition , the high internal consistencies of these scales 257 Community Mental Health Journal ( 2022 ) 58 : 249 – 260 1 3 and the consistency of the significance of similar socio - demographic correlates across all four behavioral health categories indicate that these scales are strong measures of stigmatizing attitudes for multiple behavioral health issues . Furthermore , although vignettes are accepted in the litera - ture as a way to examine respondents’ attitudes towards behavioral health , real life responses might be different ( Peluso & Blay , 2009 ) . Another limitation of our study is that respondents may have reported less stigma than they actually feel , to appear more socially desirable , although the impersonal online survey format may have minimized this effect . In addition , our racial - ethnic data is skewed towards whites , as the percentage of Black and Hispanic respondents is lower than the percentages in the U . S . popu - lation . Future research could remedy this by ensuring that future data collection efforts on this topic include a sample that is balanced based on race - ethnicity , as well as age , gender , income , and region , as was our sample . We dis - tributed our online survey used pre - existing internet panels which allowed us to access a large sample of U . S adults . Challenges with this method can include false or careless responses , and the possibility of multiple responses from the same participant ( Hays et al . , 2015 ) . We mitigated these challenges by searching for unlikely patterns in our missing data and by verifying that surveys did not originate from the same IP address . Finally , our research did not include an exhaustive set of demographic questions ( e . g . , we did not include political orientation ) , as we focused on the socio - demographic factors that had been most studied in previous research and wanted to limit the number of questions to avoid survey fatigue . Future research should explore whether these , and additional socio - demographic factors are associated with stigma . We recognize that individuals simultaneously occupy multiple social positions . Our research did not bear out the impact of this , but future research may want to consider a more multi - pronged analysis such as structural equation modelling or qualitative research to further explore the relationship between socio - demographic group status and stigma using an intersectional perspective . Future research could also use a similar model to explore how socio - demographic group membership and social status impact personal and perceived stigma towards additional behavioral health issues that were not measured in this survey , including schizophrenia and other concurrent disorders . Implications Our research reveals that socio - demographic group member - ship is a key indicator of whether or not individuals develop stigma toward AMI and SUD . Consequently , community mental health outcomes could be improved by mental health literacy programming that is targeted toward particular socio - demographic groups . Specifically , we propose that there is a need to further develop culturally adapted mental health literacy programs that include material in different languages , representations of diverse role models and cul - tures , and are led by community members ( Kreuter et al . , 2003 ; Mier et al . , 2010 ) , which have been shown to be more effective in decreasing stigma than programs that do not take socio - demographic group membership into account ( Barrera et al . , 2013 ) . Furthermore , our research indicates that whether or not particular socio - demographic groups report stigmatizing attitudes is strongly related to the social status of that group . In light of our findings that members of higher status socio - demographic groups are often more likely to report stigma toward AMI and SUD than members of lower status socio - demographic groups , we suggest an expansion of funding for mental health literacy programs that are targeted toward higher status groups . In addition , training could be mandated in spaces where members of higher status groups have the power to regularly make deci - sions that impact the lives of individuals from lower status groups , such as within educational , judicial , and political organizations . Contact - based education , wherein participants experience real or imagined interaction with individuals they would oth - erwise have no connection with , such as the Mental Health Commission of Canada’s Opening Minds project , is one type of programming that has been shown to decrease stigma towards unfamiliar experiences and groups ( Stuart et al . , 2014 ; Thornicroft et al . , 2016 ) . Such education could be two pronged : on the one hand , it could be used to help indi - viduals who have not experienced mental illness to develop empathy for those experiencing such illnesses . Additionally , it could be used to decrease prejudice and increase empathy between members of higher status and lower status socio - demographic groups ( Pettigrew & Tropp , 2008 ) , which could indirectly decrease stigma toward AMI and SUD by socializing members of higher status groups to become more comfortable with intergroup contact . Finally , our research has a number of policy implications that extend beyond community mental health . Previous research has articulated many deleterious effects of stigma , including increased dif - ficulty interacting with others , stress , status loss , and dis - crimination ( Link & Phelan , 2013 ) . These consequences can also impact the tangible resources to which individuals have access , such as job stability , financial success ( Corrigan & Watson , 2002 ; Stuber et al . , 2008 ) and mental health treat - ment ( Corrigan , 2004 ) . Therefore , devising programs that effectively decrease stigmatizing attitudes would benefit individuals who experience AMI and / or SUD , but could also contribute to the well - being of the broader community in which individuals reside . 258 Community Mental Health Journal ( 2022 ) 58 : 249 – 260 1 3 Conclusions Our findings indicate that the status associated with particu - lar socio - demographic groups is often related to whether or not groups are likely to stigmatize people who experience AMI and SUD . These findings provide an understanding of how stigma reproduces social hierarchies leading to inequal - ity and discrimination for individuals experiencing behavio - ral health issues ( Hatzenbuehler et al . , 2013 ; Link & Hatzen - buehler , 2016 ) . In particular , our findings provide evidence about how members of different socio - demographic groups are de / valued ( Lamont , 2012 ) and about who has the author - ity to make these valuations . It is important to understand these processes as they often compound the economic , psy - chological , and social difficulties encountered by individu - als experiencing AMI and / or SUD and make it less likely that these individuals will seek out and receive appropri - ate behavioral health treatment ( Corrigan & Watson , 2002 ; Link & Phelan , 2013 ; Stuber et al . , 2008 ) . Therefore , our research adds to the breadth of existing work that highlights the necessity of developing strategies that work to decrease stigma ( Corrigan , 2004 ; Martin et al . , 2000 ) .
