This prompted intensive research to elucidate the structure , biochemistry and biology of wild - type and mutant Ras proteins to provide clues for the development of small molecules to block mutant Ras function in cancer . For the purpose of this review , the focus will be exclusively on the ‘classical’ Ras protein family members H - , N - and K - Ras ( isoforms 4A and 4B ) . We sum - marize the unsuccessful approaches that have been considered to directly target mutant Ras , the directions taken to block Ras membrane association or downstream effector signaling , and , more recently , unbiased functional screens for synthetic lethal partners of mutant KRAS . RAS gene mutation in human cancer : the focus is now on KRAS  KRAS : the most frequently mutated RAS gene in human cancers The three human RAS genes ( HRAS , KRAS and NRAS ) encode four highly related ( > 90 % identity ) proteins ( F iguRe 1A ) . Mutational acti - vation of RAS genes is associated with 33 % of human cancers , making it one of the most frequent oncogenic mutations [ 2 ] . Although HRAS was historically the most studied RAS gene , ironically , it is the isoform least mutated in human cancers . From data available at the COSMIC database ( [ 201 ] www . sanger . ac . uk / genetics / CGP / cosmic / ) , mutations in KRAS are associated with the highest percentage of all human cancers ( 21 . 6 % ) , followed by NRAS ( 8 . 0 % ) , and with HRAS mutations the least fre - quently mutated ( 3 . 3 % ) . KRAS mutations com - prise 86 % of all RAS mutations ( F iguRe 1B ) . In particular , KRAS is the predominant or exclu - sive RAS gene mutated in three of the top four neoplasms that account for cancer deaths in the USA : lung , colon and pancreatic cancer [ 3 ] . As described later in the article , there is evidence for distinct functions of RAS genes in normal and neoplastic cell biology .  Genome - wide sequencing of human cancers : KRAS mutation is the predominant oncogene alteration in lung , colon & pancreatic cancer Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) is the most common cancer of the pancreas , comprising over 85 % of all cases [ 4 ] . With an estimated 43 , 140 new cases and 36 , 800 deaths in 2010 , PDAC ranks fourth in cancer - related deaths in the USA and has a relative 1 - year sur - vival rate of 20 % , and a 5 - year survival rate of only 4 % [ 3 ] . A model for PDAC development , where muta - tional activation of KRAS and the mutational loss of TP53 , SMAD4 and CDKN2A ( encodes p16 INK4A and p19 ARF ) tumor suppres - sor function define key genetic steps in tumor progression [ 5 , 6 ] ( F iguRe 1C ) . In particular , the frequent mutation of KRAS has been well - established [ 7 ] . With the recent complete exon sequencing of pancreatic cancer , it was estab - lished that the most frequently mutated genes in this cancer were already known [ 8 ] . While many novel genes were found to be mutated , their low representation in a majority of pancreatic Inhibition of Ras for cancer treatment : the search continues The RAS oncogenes ( HRAS , NRAS and KRAS ) comprise the most frequently mutated class of oncogenes in human cancers ( 33 % ) , thus stimulating intensive effort in developing anti - Ras inhibitors for cancer treatment . Despite intensive effort , to date , no effective anti - Ras strategies have successfully made it to the clinic . We present an overview of past and ongoing strategies to inhibit oncogenic Ras in cancer . Since approaches to directly target mutant Ras have not been successful , most efforts have focused on indirect approaches to block Ras membrane association or downstream effector signaling . While inhibitors of effector signaling are currently under clinical evaluation , genome - wide unbiased genetic screens have identified novel directions for future anti - Ras drug discovery .

Chem . ( 2011 ) 3 ( 14 ) 1788 future science group cancers verified that aberrant K - Ras function remains the most important target for pancreatic cancer treatment . Prior to exon sequencing of PDAC , the most frequently mutated genes known to be associ - ated with the progression of this cancer were KRAS and the TP53 , CDKN2A and SMAD4 tumor suppressors [ 4 ] . The outcome of sequence analyses of 20 , 661 genes in 24 pancreatic cancers was that these same four genes remained the top four most frequently mutated genes , with KRAS mutations found in 114 of 114 PDAC tumors [ 8 ] . With an estimated 142 , 570 new cases and 51 , 370 deaths in 2010 , colorectal cancer ( CRC ) ranks third in cancer - related deaths in the USA [ 3 ] . Frequent KRAS mutations had been established previously for CRC [ 9 ] and com - prising an early genetic event in CRC progres - sion ( F iguRe 1D ) [ 10 ] . A similar picture emerged from exon sequencing of colorectal cancers . In a study in which 18 , 191 genes were sequenced in 11 colorectal tumors , KRAS was the most fre - quently mutated oncogene and second only to TP53 mutations for all mutated genes [ 11 ] . With an estimated 232 , 520 new cases and 157 , 300 deaths in 2010 , lung cancer ranks first in cancer - related deaths in the USA [ 3 ] . In a study of 188 primary lung adenocarcinomas , where 623 genes with known or potential relationships to cancer were sequenced , KRAS was the most frequently mutated oncogene [ 12 ] . When taken together , these sequencing studies verify that KRAS remains the most significant target for new therapies for these three deadly cancers .  Mutant RAS function is required for tumor maintenance Since KRAS mutation is typically an early event in cancer progression , and since cancer is a multi - step genetic process , there remains debate as to whether targeting aberrant Ras function alone will be a therapeutically useful approach H - Ras N - Ras K - Ras4A K - Ras4B 189 aa 188 aa 189 aa 189 aa 91 % 93 % 93 % KRAS ( 90 % ) CDKN2A Normal epithelium PanIN - 1A PanIN - 1B PanIN - 2 PanIN - 3 PDAC Invasion and metastasis Invasion and metastasis Carcinoma in situ Late adenoma Intermediateadenoma Early adenoma Aberrant crypt foci Normal epithelium TP53 SMAD4 KRAS ( 50 % ) SMAD4 TP53 APC NRAS ( 11 % ) HRAS ( 3 % ) KRAS ( 86 % ) A B C D Future Med .

Inhibition of Ras for cancer treatment : the search continues | R eview www . future - science . com 1789 future science group for the advanced cancer [ 13 , 14 ] . One of the first studies supporting the importance of mutant KRAS for tumor cell growth involved homolo - gous recombination ablation of the endogenous KRAS allele in HCT - 166 and DLC - 1 colorectal carcinoma cell lines that harbored additional genetic mutations [ 15 ] . Loss of the mutant but not wild - type KRAS allele greatly impaired anchor - age - independent growth and tumor growth in nude mice . A second key study assessed the importance of activated RAS for mouse melanoma tumor formation and maintenance [ 16 ] . Using a dox - ycycline - inducible mutant HRAS transgene in a mouse melanoma model null for the INK4A tumor suppressor , doxycycline treatment caused primary melanoma tumor formation . Upon withdrawal of doxycycline and downregulation of mutant HRAS expression , dramatic tumor regression was seen . A third key study utilized RNA interfer - ence to stably silence mutant KRAS expression in CAPAN - 1 pancreatic carcinoma cell lines , resulting in impaired tumorigenic growth [ 17 ] . Similarly , using inducible shRNA to silence mutant KRAS in SW480 colorectal or CAPAN - 1 pancreatic human tumor cells reduced tumor xenograft growth in mice [ 18 ] . These and many similar studies provide compelling evidence that if pharmacologic ablation of mutant Ras function can be achieved in advanced cancers , there will likely be a very significant therapeutic benefit . Mutant Ras proteins are persistently GTP - bound & active Ras proteins function as GDP / GTP - regulated binary on – off switches that regulate cytoplasmic signal transduction ( F iguRe 2A ) . Wild - type Ras proteins cycle between a GTP - bound ( active ) and GDP - bound ( inactive ) state , which is regu - lated by guanine - nucleotide exchange factors ( RasGEFs ) that promote formation of Ras - GTP and GTPase - activating proteins ( RasGAPs ) that promote formation of inactive Ras - GDP [ 19 ] . Mutant Ras proteins contain single amino acid missense mutations ( most commonly at residues 12 , 13 or 61 ) that render them GAP - insensitive , and thus persistently GTP - bound and active , leading to chronic stimulus - independent activa - tion of effector signaling ( F iguRe 2B ) . Therefore , one of the first considerations for develop - ing anti - Ras inhibitors was based on the suc - cessful template of developing small - molecule antagonists of ATP binding to protein kinases .

Ras - GTP binds preferentially to downstream effectors ( E ) . RasGAPs ( e . g . , neurofibromin ) accelerate the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis activity , returning Ras to the inactive state . ( B ) Tumor - associated Ras .

Key Term GTPases : A large family of enzymes that exhibit high - affinity binding for guanosine diphosphate ( GDP ) and guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) and that catalyze the hydrolysis of the bound GTP to GDP and release of orthophoshpate . GTPases function as molecular switches and timers that cycle between inactive GDP - bound and active GTP - bound states . Guanine nucleotide exchange promotes formation of the GTP - bound state owing to the approximately tenfold cellular GTP : GDP ratio . The human genome encodes for approximately 220 GTPases , with the Ras superfamily comprising the largest group ( 154 members ) , followed by the heterotrimeric G protein a subunits ( 16 members ) . GTPases are characterized by short stretches of amino acid sequence similarity that comprise the GDP – GTP binding pocket . R eview | Baines , Xu & Der Future Med . Chem . ( 2011 ) 3 ( 14 ) 1790 future science group competitive protein kinase inhibitors bind with nanomolar affinities . In contrast , the main rea - son for the lack of success with GTP antagonists is the high binding affinity at picomolar levels of GTP to Ras . A second strategy for inhibiting Ras included efforts to develop small molecules that can ‘mimic’ RasGAP and restore the GTPase activity of mutant Ras proteins . Unfortunately , despite the discovery of RasGAP to guide these efforts , no success was seen for these endeavors . After these disappointments in developing thera - pies that directly targeted oncogenic Ras , the focus was shifted to more indirect approaches .  Ras proteins are membrane - associated signal transducers : indirect approaches for targeting Ras Initially , it was believed that Ras proteins were solely positioned at the inner face of the plasma membrane where they act as signal transducers for cell surface receptors . However , subsequent studies have demonstrated that , in addition to the plasma membrane , Ras signaling has now been observed on intracellular membranes such as endosomes , the endoplasmic reticulum , the Golgi apparatus , and mitochondria [ 20 ] . This subcellular compartmentalization of signaling helps to explain the role Ras plays in the diversity of cellular processes , including growth , survival and differentiation . Receptors found on these membranes ( e . g . , receptor tyrosine kinases , G - protein - coupled receptors , integrins , etc . ) are activated by a diverse spectrum of intracellular and extracellular stimuli . The activated recep - tors then initiate signaling activities that lead to RasGEF - mediated transient activation of Ras . Activated Ras can then bind to and stimulate a diverse spectrum of functionally diverse down - stream effectors , resulting in regulated activa - tion of a complex array of cytoplasmic signaling networks . Ras activation is transient , returning back to the inactive state when the stimulus is terminated . The essential roles of membrane association and downstream effector signaling in Ras - mediated oncogenesis provide the foun - dation for the two primary indirect approaches that have been pursued for blocking Ras . In the following sections , we highlight the various strategies that have been used . Inhibitors of Ras membrane association Post - translational lipid modification and mem - brane association are key determinants neces - sary for the proper functioning of Ras . The four Ras proteins terminate with a C - terminal CAAX tetrapeptide motif ( where C = cysteine , A = aliphatic amino acid , X = terminal amino acid ) , which is the target for covalent addition of a C15 farnesyl isoprenoid lipid , catalyzed by the enzyme farnesyltransferase ( FTase ) ( F iguRe 3 ) [ 21 ] . Two subsequent modifications signaled by the farnesylated CAAX motif are endoproteolytic cleavage of the AAX sequence catalyzed by the Ras - converting enzyme - 1 ( Rce1 ) and the carboxymethylation of the now terminal isoprenylated cysteine residue by the isoprenylcysteine carboxymethyltransferase - 1 ( Icmt1 ) . While these CAAX modifications are necessary , they are not sufficient to promote Ras association ( RA ) with the inner face of the plasma membrane . Instead , Ras proteins pos - sess a second C - terminal signal upsteam of the CAAX motif that promotes full plasma - mem - brane recruitment and , hence , full Ras func - tion . H - Ras , N - Ras and K - Ras4A undergo an additional covalent modification , the addition of palmitate fatty acid to cysteine residues . K - Ras4B contains a polybasic amino acid sequence that serves as a second signal for its association with the plasma membrane . Inhibitors of Ras mem - brane association involve either inhibitors of FTase or farnesyl moiety - containing molecules that are proposed to function as antagonists of Ras membrane association .  Farnesyltransferase inhibitors Since the 1989 discovery that Ras proteins are farnesylated , and shown to be essential for Ras membrane association and transformation , much emphasis has been placed on success - fully targeting this lipid modification [ 22 , 23 ] . Structure – function mutagenesis studies of the CAAX motif provided the first evidence that farnesylation was critical for Ras - transforming activity . Mutation of the cysteine residue of the CAAX motif prevented farnesylation and all subsequent C - terminal modifications , rendering Ras cytosolic and non - transforming [ 24 – 26 ] . The finding that Ras function was critically dependent on farnesylation stimulated ample excitement towards the possibility of identify - ing a pharmacologic approach of inhibiting Ras function , especially considering that the farnesyl pyrophosphate contributing this lipid group to proteins was a necessary intermediate component of the mevalonate - cholesterol bio - synthetic pathway , whose synthesis could be blocked by cholesterol - lowering drugs already in clinical use ( e . g . , lovastatin ) . Lovastatin , an Inhibition of Ras for cancer treatment : the search continues | R eview www . future - science . com 1791 future science group HMG - CoA reductase inhibitor , was the first US FDA - approved statin for lowering cholesterol to prevent cardiovascular disease in patients with hypercholesterolemia . However , since the clini - cally effective concentration of statins sufficient for lowering cholesterol biosynthesis was much lower than the concentration needed to block Ras farnesylation [ 27 ] , the search began for the enzyme required for the addition of the farnesyl group to Ras . In 1990 Goldstein , Brown and colleagues isolated and characterized the FTase enzyme [ 28 ] . They also showed that the Ras CAAX tetrapeptide sequence alone was effective in blocking FTase activity . These findings stimulated a frenzied effort by both pharmaceutical companies and academic researchers to design cell - permeable CAAX peptidomimetics as possible FTase inhibitors ( FTIs ) [ 22 , 23 ] . Additionally , with the enzyme in hand , high - throughput chemical library screens were initiated to identify small - mol - ecule inhibitors of FTase and used to develop potent and selective FTIs . One potential com - plication in these efforts was the existence of a closely related enzyme , geranylgeranyltransferase type I ( GGTase - I ) [ 29 ] . Like FTase , GGTase - I recognizes C - terminal CAAX motifs . However , GGTase - I preferentially recognizes CAAX motifs where the terminal X residue is leucine , and catalyzes the addition of the more hydro - phobic C20 geranylgeranyl isoprenoid . In con - trast , FTase preferentially recognizes CAAX motifs where X is methionine , alanine , serine or glutamine .

Icmt : Isoprenylcysteine carboxymethyltransferase ; Rce : Ras - converting enzyme . R eview | Baines , Xu & Der Future Med . Chem . ( 2011 ) 3 ( 14 ) 1792 future science group Numerous chemically diverse FTIs were developed , including CAAX eptidomimetics , nonpeptide peptidomimetics , farnesyl diphos - phate analogs and bisubstrate inhibitors with several advancing into clinical testing for oncol - ogy , either alone or in combination with con - ventional cytotoxic drugs [ 22 ] . Generally , these showed potent selectivity for FTase and not the closely related GGTase - I . Of these , two nonpep - tide peptidomimetics , tipifarnib ( R115777 ) and lonafarnib ( SCH66336 ) , underwent the most significant clinical evaluation ( F iguRe 3 ) . FTase inhibitors showed impressive anti - H - Ras and anti - tumor activity in preclinical cell culture [ 30 , 31 ] and mouse models , in particular an H - Ras - driven mammary tumor model [ 32 ] . These impressive observations resulted in FTIs entering Phase I studies in 1999 , with some progressing to Phase III clinical trials in 2002 . However , two key issues led to the eventual demise of FTIs in the clinic and as anti - Ras inhibitors [ 23 ] . First , many of the early preclini - cal studies focused on models of H - Ras - driven oncogenesis . An early suggestion that such mod - els were not accurate models for FTI evaluation came from a study that showed that tumor cell line sensitivity to FTI growth inhibition in vitro did not correlate with RAS mutation status [ 33 ] . While FTIs , indeed , effectively blocked H - Ras farnesylation , membrane association and trans - formation , it was subsequently determined that FTIs did not effectively block N - Ras and K - Ras protein prenylation , membrane association and transforming activity [ 34 – 37 ] . This was due to an unexpected biochemical difference among the three Ras proteins . When FTase activity is blocked , K - Ras4B and N - Ras ( the two most com - mon mutated Ras proteins in cancer ) can serve as substrates for GGTase - I and undergo alternative prenylation with the addition of a geranylgeranyl isoprenoid , a structurally related lipid , which can effectively substitute for the farnesyl group and support Ras membrane association and trans - forming activity [ 38 , 39 ] . Therefore , it was not surprising that Phase II / III clinical trial analyses with pancreatic cancer , where KRAS is mutated in 90 % of all pancreatic cancers , resulted in negative findings [ 40 – 42 ] . A second key misconception regarding FTIs was the simple assumption that they acted as ‘anti - Ras inhibitors’ , yet Ras proteins are not the only substrates for FTase [ 29 ] . There are a number of farnesylated proteins ( > 50 ) with various roles in the cell , including growth regulation [ 43 ] . For example , the Rheb small GTPase [ 43 ] is a farnesylated protein and an activator of mam - malian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) , a path - way commonly deregulated in cancer . Thus , the anti - tumor activities of FTIs very likely involve inhibition of function of other farnesylated pro - teins . The therapeutic value of FTIs may also be complicated by inhibiting the function of some farnesylated Ras family GTPases that func - tion as tumor suppressors ( e . g . , Di - Ras1 / Rig , ARHI / NOEY2 and RRP22 / RasL10A ) [ 44 – 46 ] . Despite some patients responding to FTI treat - ment , because the identity of the therapeutically important target ( s ) for these responses is not known , FTIs are no longer being pursued for oncology . Recently , however , FTIs have been con - sidered for the treatment of other diseases . In par - ticular , Hutchinson – Gilford Progeria Syndrome ( also called progeria ) is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding lamin A ( LMNA ) , resulting in expression of a defective lamin A protein that retains the farnesyl modification . Promising results with FTI treatment in cell culture [ 47 – 50 ] and mouse models [ 51 ] support their clinical value for this disease [ 52 ] . Since progeria patients number fewer than 50 worldwide , that FTIs may fortuitously serve as a therapeutic approach for this disorder prompted the first ever clinical trial for this disease in 2007 . Completed in 2009 , the results from this trial have yet to be reported . A second clinical trial is planned , where lonafarnib will be used in combination with pravastatin ( an inhibitor of the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway and hence all protein prenylation ) and zoledronic acid , a biphosphonate that is an approved drug used to prevent skeletal fractures in patients with cancers , as well as for treating osteoporosis [ 202 ] . In light of the alternative prenylation seen with K - Ras and N - Ras when FTase activity is blocked , concurrent inhibition of both FTase and GGTase - I have also been considered . However , because there are over 50 known or putative sub - strates for GGTase - I [ 29 ] , normal cell toxicity has been a concern with such approaches . Despite this concern , cell culture and tumor xenograft studies [ 37 , 53 – 55 ] , and additional genetic studies in mouse models of RAS - driven oncogenesis [ 56 , 57 ] support the anti - tumor activity of GGTase - I inhibitors ( GGTIs ) , with one highly selec - tive GGTI ( GGTI - 2418 ) currently in Phase I clinical evaluation . Early Phase I results found GGTI - 2418 well tolerated with minimal toxic - ity , supporting expansion of the trial [ 203 ] . One FTI evaluated in clinical trials , L - 778 , 123 , also possessed dual - inhibitory activity for GGTase - I ( FTase IC 50 = 2 nM , GGTase - I IC 50 = 98 nM ) Inhibition of Ras for cancer treatment : the search continues | R eview www . future - science . com 1793 future science group and inhibited GGTase - I activity in the patient , but nevertheless still failed to block K - Ras prenylation [ 58 ] .  Inhibitors of Rce1 & Icmt In addition to FTases , the two less explored CAAX - signaled modifications have also been considered as targets for anti - Ras inhibitors [ 59 ] . Compared to FTIs , there was only a 50 % reduc - tion in K - Ras4B membrane association and trans - forming activity when the Rce1 and Icmt modi - fications were blocked [ 60 ] . These observations suggested limited clinical value in targeting these two enzymes . However , recent studies provide evidence for the potential usefulness of inhibi - tors of Rce1 and Icmt inhibitors for blocking Ras oncogenicity . Their effectiveness may be due to the concurrent impairment of function of other CAAX - terminating small GTPases ( e . g . , Rac and Ral ) that have been shown to be required for Ras - mediated growth transformation . In one group of studies , mouse embryo fibroblasts deficient in Rce1 revealed that Ras proteins were incompletely processed and membrane - associated [ 61 , 62 ] . Cre - mediated loss of RCE1 in fibroblasts generated from mice with a conditional RCE1 allele resulted in a loss of endoproteolytic processing and methylation of the Ras protein . Additionally , excision of RCE1 reduced anchorage - independent growth in Ras - mediated transformation . In another study , excision of RCE1 in a skin carcinoma cell line greatly reduced their growth [ 62 ] . Loss of ICMT resulted in inhibition of K - Ras - mediated anchorage - independent growth in soft - agar assays and tumor growth in nude mice . Finally , in a recent study , an ICMT deficiency reduced lung tumor development in a mouse model of KRAS - induced cancer [ 63 ] . However , this issue may be highly context - dependent , since an Rce1 deficiency was found to accelerate mutant KRAS - induced myeloproliferative disease [ 64 ] . In reference to Rce1 as a target for anti - Ras inhibition , only limited development of Rce1 inhibitors has been described . In one study , several compounds were found to be effective at a low micromolar range for both yeast and human Rce1 in a compound library screen and were identified as possible tools for the design of future Rce1 inhibitors [ 65 ] . An additional study showed that peptidyl ( acyloxy ) methyl ketones could inhibit Rce1 enzyme activity in vitro [ 66 ] . From a chemical library screen , a small molecular inhibitor of Icmt , cysmethynil ( 2 - [ 5 - ( 3 - methylphenyl ) - 1 - octyl - 1H - indol - 3 - yl ] acetamide ) , was identified by Casey and col - leagues [ 59 ] . Cysmethynil treatment inhibited cell growth in an Icmt - dependent fashion and resulted in mislocalization of Ras in cancer cells . In addition , the anchorage - independent growth of a colon cancer cell line was blocked by cys - methynil , and this effect was reversed by ectopic overexpression of Icmt , indicating that the inhi - bition was target - based . Additionally , treatment of PC3 human prostate cell - derived xenograft tumors with cysmethynil resulted in markedly reduced tumor size [ 67 ] . Other small molecules with Icmt inhibitory activity have also been described . The antifolate compound methotrexate has been shown to inhibit Icmt function . In a colon cancer cell line , methotrexate treatment resulted in a decrease in methylation of the Ras protein by nearly 90 % , and mislocalization of Ras to the cytoplasm [ 68 ] . Several natural product inhibitors of Icmt have been discovered in a high - throughput screen campaign [ 69 – 71 ] . Finally , palmitoylation have also been con - sidered as a potential anti - Ras target [ 72 , 73 ] . However , the enzymology of Ras palmitoyla - tion is complex and a better understanding of the specificity of the DHHC domain proteins that function as S - palmitoyltransferases remains to be achieved .  Farnesyl - containing small - molecule inhibitors of Ras membrane association As discussed earlier , C - terminal farnesylation of Ras is critical for localization to the plasma membrane , and this localization is necessary for Ras binding to effector molecules in the various downstream signaling pathways . Studies have shown that insertion of the lipophilic prenyl moiety into the plasma ( or other lipid bilayer ) membrane is not a simple random event , but that specific ‘prenyl receptors’ facilitate pre - nylated protein binding [ 74 ] . These and other studies [ 38 , 75 – 78 ] lend support to the hypoth - esis that prenylation also provides specificity for interaction partners . Therefore , ongoing work is focused on inhibiting the binding of farnesylated Ras to sites on the inner surface of the plasma membrane . Two farnesyl isoprenoid - containing small molecules have been described , salirasib ( also called FTS ; S - trans : trans - farnesylthiosalicylic acid ) and TLN - 4601 [ 79 – 82 ] , which are proposed to antagonize Ras function by competition for membrane - bound farnesyl - binding dock - ing proteins . Whereas clinical trial analyses of R eview | Baines , Xu & Der Future Med . Chem . ( 2011 ) 3 ( 14 ) 1794 future science group TLN - 4601 have recently been terminated , there are continued preclinical and clinical analyses of salirasib . Salirasib , a farnesylcysteine mimetic , selec - tively disrupts the association of chronically active Ras proteins with the plasma mem - brane [ 83 ] . The proposed mechanism of salirasib is compete with Ras for binding to membrane - associated Ras escort proteins ( galectins ) , which possess putative farnesyl - binding domains , thereby dislodging Ras from the plasma mem - brane and disrupting effector signaling . Studies show that galectin - 1 interacts with mutant H - Ras and K - Ras , and that this interaction is required for membrane localization of the GTPases and subsequent transforming activity in human and rat epithelial cells [ 84 , 85 ] . Salirasib blocks the membrane association of H - , K - , and N - Ras proteins in both transformed cells and cancer cells with oncogenic mutant Ras or hyperactivated wild - type Ras , including pan - creatic , melanoma , glioblastoma , neuroblastoma and neurofibromatosis cancer cells [ 80 , 86 – 92 ] . Additionally , Kloog and colleagues demon - strated that signaling from three of the most - studied effector pathways downstream of Ras , Raf – MEK – ERK [ 88 ] , RalGEF – Ral [ 92 ] and PI3K – AKT [ 90 – 93 ] , could be suppressed by treat - ment with salirasib . Inhibition of aberrant Ras activation in cells by salirasib may alter a variety of cellular properties , including cell survival [ 94 ] , proliferation [ 80 , 86 ] and migration [ 93 , 95 ] . In another study , tumor growth was inhibited by salirasib and was associated with a reduction of the abundance of Ras in the tumor tissue in pan - creatic and neurofibromatosis xenograft tumor models [ 92 , 96 ] . However , salirasib has also been shown to block mTOR activity directly [ 97 – 99 ] , an unexpected activity in light of the fact that mTOR is not farnesylated . Therefore , salirasib may possess multiple mechanisms of action that can contribute to inhibition of tumor growth . Finally , Phase I clinical trials have shown that salirasib was well - tolerated and several Phase I / II trials are ongoing [ 100 ] . Targeting downstream Ras effector signaling pathways Activated Ras binds preferentially to a spectrum of functionally diverse downstream effectors in which most are characterized by Ras binding or RA domains that directly interact with Ras [ 101 ] . The Raf kinases are the best characterized of all the effectors of Ras ( F iguRe 4 ) [ 102 ] . However , there exist at least ten functionally distinct classes of Ras effectors , with evidence for Raf and four non - Raf effectors in Ras transformation . The frequent mutational activation of B - Raf ( 20 % ) and the PIK3CA gene product ( 12 % ) , the p110 a catalytic subunit of PI3K in human cancers , together with the well - established role of these pathways in sig - naling networks that regulate cell growth [ 102 , 103 ] , have provided strong validation of the importance of these two effectors in oncogenic Ras function . Cell culture [ 104 ] and mouse model [ 105 – 107 ] studies support the importance of the Ral GTPase - specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( RalGEF ) , phospholipase C epsilon and Tiam1 effectors in Ras - mediated oncogenesis . The involvement of multiple effectors in Ras - mediated oncogenesis prompts several questions . First , is there one ‘right’ effector pathway for targeting or will concurrent inhibition of mul - tiple effector pathways be required ? Second , will mutant K - Ras utilize the same effector pathways in lung , colon and pancreatic cancer , or will can - cer type - specific approaches be required ? Now , we will summarize the validation and status of the development of inhibitors of the three best validated Ras effector signaling networks .  Inhibitors of the Raf – MEK – ERK MAPK cascade The best understood and most heavily studied Ras effector pathway is the Raf – MEK – ERK MAPK cascade [ 102 ] . Raf serine / threonine pro - tein kinases ( A - Raf , B - Raf and c - Raf - 1 ) phos - phorylate and activate the substrates MEK1 and MEK2 dual - specificity protein kinases , and MEK1 / 2 in turn phosphorylate and acti - vate the ERK1 and ERK2 MAPKs . Activated ERKs then phosphorylate and regulate the activ - ities of a diverse spectrum of substrates that are estimated to comprise over 160 proteins [ 108 ] . The non - overlapping occurrence of BRAF and RAS mutations in melanoma and CRC suggests functionally equivalent roles in Ras - mediated oncogenesis [ 109 ] . It is this phenomenon that has made the Raf – MEK – ERK MAPK pathway an attractive target for therapeutics against cancers harboring RAS mutations . Currently , multiple inhibitors of Raf and MEK kinases are in pre - clinical and clinical development ( F iguRe 5 & T ABle 1 ) [ 110 ] . Below we focus on two Raf inhib - itors ( sorafenib and PLX4032 ) and one MEK inhibitor ( AZD ) that have undergone significant clinical evaluation . Originally developed as an inhibitor of Raf - 1 [ 111 ] , sorafenib ( BAY 43 - 9006 ) is a potent inhibitor of both wild - type and mutant Key Term MAPK cascades : These cascades are three - component protein kinase modules , beginning with an extracellular stimulus - activated MAPK and MKKK / MEKK serine / threonine kinase , which phosphorylates and activates a MAPK dual - specificity MAPK kinase ( MKK / MEK ) , which then phosphorylates and activates a MAPK serine / threonine kinase . There are four conventional mammalian MAPK families : ERK1 / 2 , p38 ( a b g and d ) , JNK1 / 2 / 3 and ERK5 .

From crystallographic analyses , it was determined that the inhibitor bound to the ATP - binding pocket and pre - vented kinase activation , preventing substrate binding and phosphorylation [ 112 ] . However , it was later reported that sorafenib is a potent kinase inhibitor of multiple cell - surface recep - tors involved in tumor angiogenesis including VEGFR - 2 , VEGFR - 3 , PDGFR - b , Flt - 3 , c - Kit and FGFR - 1 [ 113 ] . Sorafenib was approved in 2005 for the treat - ment of advanced renal cell carcinomas and in 2007 for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . Since the frequency of BRAF and RAS mutations in these cancers is low [ 2 , 114 , 115 ] , it is unclear whether Raf inhibition is the mecha - nism for anti - tumor activity of sorafenib . Instead , the anti - angiogenesis activity of sor - afenib is most likely the basis for its efficacy in these cancers . PLX4032 ( now called vemurafenib / RO5185426 ) , a potent and selective inhibitor of mutant B - Raf , is currently in Phase I / II clinical evaluation . In vitro analysis against a panel of 65 non - Raf kinase showed PLX4032 is a highly selective inhibitor of B - Raf kinase activity , with an IC 50 value of 44 nM against V600E - mutant B - Raf [ 116 ] . Most of the kinases tested showed > 100 - fold higher IC 50 values than mutant Raf . In addition , cell culture experiments showed PLX4032 potently inhibited cell proliferation and MEK activation in melanoma and thyroid carcinoma cell lines harboring mutant B - Raf . Recent cell culture and mouse model studies with PLX4032 found that it is effective against BRAF mutant tumor cell lines , but , paradoxi - cally , led to Raf activation in RAS mutant cell lines [ 117 – 119 ] . For BRAF mutant tumor cells , inhibition of ERK activation and growth were seen . In contrast , ERK activation rather than inactivation was seen in RAS mutant cell lines . The mechanistic explanation for this unexpected activity is based on earlier observations of a role for dimerization formation in Raf activa - tion [ 119 ] .

Of these , five have been validated in cell culture and / or mouse models for their requirement for mutant Ras - induced oncogenesis . In addition to direct mutational activation of Ras , it can also be activated indirectly , for example , by mutational inactivation of the neurofibromin RasGAP or by mutational activation of the EGFR . R eview | Baines , Xu & Der Future Med . Chem . ( 2011 ) 3 ( 14 ) 1796 future science group Raf inhibitors requires Raf binding to mutation - ally activated Ras , but only when Raf activation is dependent on Ras . These findings poten - tially argue against the use of Raf inhibitors in RAS - mutant tumors . Consistent with these preclinical findings , recent Phase I / II evaluation of PLX4032 have shown dramatic anti - tumor activity with mutant BRAF melanomas . In a Phase I / II clinical trial , it was found that treatment of BRAF mutant metastatic melanoma with PLX4032 resulted in complete or partial tumor regression in the majority of patients [ 120 ] . However , only 52 % of patients with the BRAF mutation responded to PLX4032 and , for those patients who responded , drug resistance developed quickly , from 2 to 18 months and an average duration of response of only 6 . 2 months . Results from Phase III clinical trials were recently reported , with responses far superior to that for the stand - ard of care , dacarbazine [ 121 ] . Overall survival was 84 % in the PLX4032 ( vemurafenib ) group and 64 % in the dacarbazine group . When com - pared with dacarbazine , PLX4032 was associ - ated with a relative reduction of 63 % in the risk of death and of 74 % in the risk of either death or disease progression . Response rates were sig - nificantly improved , 48 % for PLX4032 and 5 % for dacarbazine . Additional studies of PLX4032 provide fur - ther insight into the mechanism of action of PLX4032 . First , Bollag and colleagues deter - mined that a near - complete suppression of ERK activation is apparently required for a clinical response [ 122 ] .

Inhibition of Ras for cancer treatment : the search continues | R eview www . future - science . com 1797 future science group correlated with clinical efficacy . Second , two studies addressed possible mechanisms of tumor resistance [ 123 , 124 ] . In contrast to the resistance mechanisms seen with BCR - Abl and the epider - mal growth factor receptor , where mutations in the drug target impair drug binding , indirect mechanisms ( e . g . , NRAS mutation ) were seen for PLX4032 resistance . A number of potent and selective MEK1 and MEK2 inhibitors have been developed and are currently under clinical evaluation ( F iguRe 5 ) . With being the only known catalytic substrates of Raf kinases , MEK1 and MEK2 are closely related dual - specificity kinases , capable of phos - phorylating both serine / threonine and tyrosine residues of their substrates , p44 ERK1 and p42 ERK2 ( F iguRe 4 ) . The fact that ERK1 / 2 are the only known substrates of MEK1 / 2 , has led to perhaps an oversimplified perception of this signaling pathway , as a simply unidirec - tional linear signaling pathway . Often depicted as such a simple pathway downstream of Ras , it prompts the logical assumption that inhibi - tion of this pathway at the level of Raf or MEK should be equivalent in blocking ERK activation by mutant Ras . Of the many MEK1 / 2 inhibitors under devel - opment , there has been significant preclinical study of selumetinib ( AZD6244 ) . Selumetinib is an orally bioavailable benzimidazole deriva - tive known to potently inhibit MEK1 / 2 in vitro and in cell - based assays [ 6 , 125 – 127 ] . Like other MEK inhibitors , selumetinib is an ATP , non - competitive inhibitor , contributing to their very selective properties . Preclinical evaluation of selumetinib showed anti - tumor activity in sev - eral human xenograft models including colon , pancreas , breast , non - small cell lung cancer and melanoma , and has moved into clinical devel - opment . Cell culture studies suggest that MEK inhibitors may be effective against BRAF but not RAS mutant cancer cells [ 126 – 128 ] . These stud - ies also reveal compensatory feedback mecha - nisms that may allow tumor cells to overcome the growth - inhibitory consequences of MEK inhibition [ 129 ] . Recently , initial results of a first - in - human dose - ranging study to assess the pharmacoki - netics , pharmacodynamics and toxicities of AZD6244 in patients with advanced solid tumors concluded that AZD6244 was well toler - ated [ 130 ] . Currently , there are up to 43 completed and ongoing Phase I / II clinical trials evaluating AZD6244 as monotherapy or in combination with conventional cytotoxic drugs [ 204 ] .  Inhibitors of the PI3K – AKT – mTOR pathway The second best - characterized Ras effectors are the catalytic subunits of the class I phosphoinosi - tol 3 - kinases ( PI3Ks ; p110 a , b , d and g ) , which has been shown to be required for Ras transfor - mation [ 131 ] . The PI3K – Akt – mTOR pathway is one of the most frequently altered signal trans - duction pathways in human cancers [ 103 ] . It has been implicated in multiple cellular functions such as proliferation and survival . PI3K con - verts phosphoinositides ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate to phosphoinositide ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate ( PIP3 ) . Membrane - associated PIP3 promotes the activa - tion of diverse cytoplasmic signaling proteins , in particular , the Akt serine / threonine kinases , as well as other signaling proteins . In addition to activation by Ras , the PI3K – AKT pathway is deregulated by a variety of mechanisms in human cancers . This can include the loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome ten ( PTEN ) , a dual - specificity phosphatase and tumor suppressor gene , and is the primary negative regulator of this pathway . Hence , the components of this pathway have been attractive targets for anticancer drug discovery , with many inhibitors of PI3K , AKT and mTOR currently under clinical trial analyses [ 132 , 133 ] ( F iguRe 5 & s upplemenTARy T ABle 1 ) . Some PI3K inhibitors are pan - class I PI3K inhibitors , others are isoform - specific , and a number of PI3K inhibitors also have activity for the structurally similar cata - lytic domain of mTOR . Two mTOR inhibitors have already been approved for use for advanced renal cell cancer ( temsirolimus and everolimus ) , which , interestingly , is a cancer with infrequent RAS mutational activation . The importance of PI3K in Ras - initiated oncogenesis was shown in mouse models where a Ras - binding impaired mutant of p110 a impaired mutant HRAS - associated skin car - cinoma formation and mutant KRAS - induced lung tumor formation [ 134 ] . However , there is limited evidence from cell culture and model studies that concurrent inhibition of the Raf – MEK – ERK and PI3K – AKT – mTOR pathways may be required for pharmacologic inhibition of mutant RAS - driven cancer growth . For example , in one study , mutant PIK3CA - but not KRAS - driven lung tumor formation was responsive to NVP - BEZ235 , a dual pan - PI3K and mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) inhibitor [ 135 ] . However , concurrent treatment with selumetinib did impair KRAS - induced tumor formation . R eview | Baines , Xu & Der Future Med . Chem . ( 2011 ) 3 ( 14 ) 1798 future science group Ta b l e 1 .

( 2011 ) 3 ( 14 ) 1800 future science group  RalGEF – Ral pathway Past studies have demonstrated that in a subset of tumors there is no correlation between KRAS mutation status and ERK activation [ 18 , 136 ] , suggesting that a Raf - independent function of Ras is important . Recent studies have demon - strated that additional effector pathways may play significant roles in Ras - mediated oncogene - sis [ 101 , 137 , 138 ] . In particular , RalGEFs are activa - tors of the highly related Ras - like RalA and RalB small GTPases ( 82 % sequence identity ) [ 139 ] . Similar to Ras , Ral GTPases function as GDP / GTP - regulated switches in signal transduction . Although there has been no evidence of muta - tions in the various components of this pathway , there is substantial evidence validating a role for Ral GTPases in multiple human cancers . The RalGEF – Ral pathway was character - ized initially to play a relatively minor role in Ras transformation of rodent fibroblasts [ 140 ] . However , subsequent studies by Counter and colleagues established a very significant role for this effector pathway in Ras transformation of human cells [ 141 ] . In particular , a significant role for Ral GTPases in pancreatic cancer has been established [ 18 , 142 ] . Additionally , studies of bladder and prostate cancer support the role of RalGEF – Ral signaling in tumor invasion and metastasis [ 143 , 144 ] . Finally , mouse model studies showed that homozygous deletion of RalGDS ( a RalGEF ) caused resistance to Ras - induced skin tumor formation [ 107 ] . One RalGEF , Rgl2 , was found overexpressed in pancreatic tumors and important for pancreatic cancer cell line growth and invasion in vitro [ 104 ] . Consequently , there is increasing interest in targeting this path - way for novel anti - Ras strategies for cancer treatment [ 145 ] . Recent studies support the possibility that inhibitors of GGTase - I ( GGTI ) can be effective inhibitors of Ral GTPases in oncogenesis [ 146 ] . Similar to Ras , Ral - GTPases terminate with a carboxyl - terminal CAAX motif . GGTaseI catalyzes addition of a geranylgeranyl isopre - noid to the cysteine residue of the CAAX motif , followed by modifications by the same Rce1 and Icmt enzymes involved in Ras processing . However , as with FTIs , since other GGTI sub - strates ( e . g . , RhoA , RhoC and Rac ) are involved in oncogenesis , GGTI anti - tumor activity may also involve inhibition of non - Ral targets . Finally , a recent study identified RalA as a sub - strate for Aurora - A [ 147 ] , since Aurora - A phos - phorylation of RalA was important for Aurora - A - induced cellular motility and transformation . Additionally , the Aurora - A phosphorylation site ( Ser - 194 ) was shown to be essential for RalA - mediated anchorage - independent growth and tumor formation [ 148 ] . These studies sug - gest that inhibitors of Aurora - A , currently in Phase I clinical trial analyses , may be effective inhibitors of RalA function . Combination therapy With only a few exceptions , conventional cytoxic cancer chemotherapy is most effective when applied as concurrent treatment with a cocktail of drugs with different mechanisms of activation . This approach is based on the fact that tumors are composed of a genetically heterogeneous popula - tion where different subpopulations will exhibit resistance to different therapeutic approaches . Therefore , it is not surprising that an emerging paradigm is that molecularly targeted therapies will also be most effective when applied in com - bination . Finally , a second trend is that molecu - larly targeted therapies can enhance the effec - tiveness of cytotoxic drugs as well as radiation treatment . Later in the article , we summarize representative examples of these combination approaches . Other examples are summarized in T ABles 1 , 2 & s upplemenTARy T ABle 1 .  Concurrent inhibition of the Raf – MEK – ERK & the PI3K – AKT – mTOR pathways That Ras can drive oncogenesis through multi - ple effectors suggests that effective inhibition of Ras will require concurrent inhibition of differ - ent effector networks . Consistent with this situa - tion , several preclinical studies have found more effective anti - tumor activity with concurrent inhibition of Raf – MEK – ERK and PI3K – AKT – mTOR . For example , mutant KRAS - driven lung tumor formation in mice was inhibited only with concurrent treatment with the ARRY - 142886 MEK inhibitor and the BEZ235 dual - specificity pan - PI3K and mTOR inhibitor [ 135 ] . Pre - clinical studies have demonstrated synergistic inhibition with co - targeting Raf – MEK – ERK MAPK and PI3K – AKT – mTOR pathways with Raf and AKT / mTOR inhibitors in human melanoma cells [ 149 ] . Also , synergistic inhibition of pro - liferation have been observed with in vitro and in vivo models of HCC and non - small cell lung cancer using combinations of MEK and mTOR inhibitors [ 150 , 151 ] . These and other observations provide the rationale for planned or ongoing clinical trials with combination inhibition of specific components of each of these two key Ras effector pathways ( T ABle 2 ) . Inhibition of Ras for cancer treatment : the search continues | R eview www . future - science . com 1801 future science group Another basis for the requirement for com - bination approaches is the induction of com - pensatory signaling mechanisms that overcome inhibition of a signaling pathway at a specific point . Such mechanisms appear to account for the resistance to Raf inhibition . As previously discussed , Raf inhibitors such as PLX4032 have been used in treating melanoma with the disap - pointing observation of drug resistance from 2 to 18 months after initial treatment [ 118 ] . One study found that resistance can occur through mutational activation of NRAS or upregu - lated expression of the PDGFR b receptor tyrosine kinase [ 124 ] . Another study described upregulation of the Cot / Tpl2 serine / threo - nine kinase [ 123 ] . These mechanisms bypass PLX4032 inhibition by activating MEK – ERK signaling by alternative routes . These resistance mechanisms may then be overcome by concur - rent treatment with inhibitors of these mecha - nisms , for example , by MEK inhibition . One clinical trial is utilizing the combined treat - ment with GSK2118436 and GSK1120212 for patients having BRAF mutant tumors treated previously with GSK2118436 alone and with no evidence for progression ( T ABle 2 ) .  Inhibition of the Raf – MEK – ERK MAPK & the PI3K – AKT – mTOR pathways with chemotherapy Chemotherapy remains as the prime treatment strategy for combating many different types of cancers [ 152 ] . Chemotherapeutic drugs target various biological processes such as DNA rep - lication and cell division in the cell ( normal and tumor ) , which can result in numerous side effects [ 153 ] . Additionally , drug resistance to chemotherapy can develop over prolonged use as has been seen with doxorubicin and taxol [ 153 ] . It is this combination of side effects and drug resistance to chemotherapy that argues for the need to identify better and alternative strategies for treating cancer . Although drug resistance occurs with chemotherapeutic drugs as well as small - mol - ecule inhibitors in cancer , studies have been conducted combining both types of drugs for determining potential synergistic growth inhibition effects against tumor cells with less toxicity to the patient . In a preclinical study combining paclitaxel ( taxol ) and MEK inhibi - tors in ovarian carcinoma cell lines , results demonstrated enhanced apoptosis and growth inhibition [ 154 ] . In a phase II clinical trial con - ducted in patients with advanced HCC , the combination of sorafenib ( Raf inhibitor ) and doxorubicin improved progression - free and overall survival [ 155 ] . In a completed second Phase II trial , the progression - free survival of sorafenib and tegafur / uracil ( UFUR ) for the treatment of advanced or metastatic HCC was studied [ 204 ] . In addition to the advantanges of combin - ing chemotherapy and small - molecule inhibi - tors for treating cancer , there are also chal - lenges . Combinations of MEK inhibitors and chemotherapy can have antagonistic results . Studies have shown that chemotherapeu - tic drugs can activate the Raf – MEK – ERK MAPK pathway through diverse mechanisms . Doxorubicin has been shown to activate both p53 and calcium calmodulin kinase , which can activate this pathway [ 153 ] . Also , taxol has been shown in studies to stimulate activa - tion of this pathway [ 156 ] . MEK inhibitors in combination with betulinic acid , a drug toxic for melanoma cells , prevented an increase in betunlinic acid - induced apoptosis in vitro [ 157 ] . Another challenge with combining chemo - therapy and inhibitors is the time schedule for adding each drug regiment . The order of administration of the chemotherapeutic drugs and inhibitors can determine a synergistic or antagonistic outcome .  Inhibition of the Raf – MEK – ERK MAPK & the PI3K – AKT – mTOR pathways with radiotherapy Although radiation is one of the common methods for treating cancers , many advanced cancers are radioresistant . Various inhibitors have been evaluated for their potential to serve as a radiosensitizer . In one study , selumetinib ( MEK inhibitor ) pretreatment of lung , pros - tate and pancreatic cancer cells sensitized them to radiation - induced cell killing in vitro and in vivo [ 158 ] . A mitotic catastrophe event ( due to radiation - induced G2 cell cycle checkpoint activation abrogation ) was found to be increased in cells receiving both the MEK inhibitor and radiation versus the inhibitor alone . In addition to the Raf – MEK – ERK MAPK pathway , PI3K – AKT - mTOR inhibitors have been demonstrated to radiosensitize the tumor vasculature both in vitro and in vivo [ 159 , 160 ] . Also , mTOR and radiation have been shown to be instrumental for the regulation of autophagy [ 160 , 161 ] . The combination of mTOR inhibitors and radia - tion may be beneficial inducing autophagy as it relates to cancer treatment . R eview | Baines , Xu & Der Future Med . Chem . ( 2011 ) 3 ( 14 ) 1802 future science group Oncogene addition & synthetic lethality : unbiased searchs for novel anti - Ras therapies In light of the current lack of success in devel - oping clinically useful anti - Ras drugs , recent studies have taken advantage of KRAS onco - gene addiction to search for synthetic lethal partners of mutant KRAS . Utilizing RNA interference ( RNAi ) technologies , large - scale interfering RNA screens have been applied to take a functional and unbiased approach to identify therapeutic targets for anti - Ras inhibi - tion [ 162 – 164 ] . Perturbation of these genes may result in oncogene - specific ‘synthetic lethal’ genetic interactions that could provide new therapeutic opportunities . These screens are based on the concept of synthetic lethality , in which two genes are defined as synthetically lethal if mutation of either gene alone is compatible with viability but the simultaneous mutation of both genes leads to death [ 165 ] . Mutationally activated RAS genes thus represent one gene and RNAi - mediated ablation in cancer cells of the expres - sion of a second gene provides the second hit . Synthetic lethal interactions can involve genes within the same pathway , genes within paral - lel pathways that cooperate with respect to an essential function , or genes within distant pathways that become functionally connected because of the response of the cell to a specific perturbation . Since normal cells lack mutant RAS , genes identified in this manner should in principle be selectively lethal for tumors but not normal cells . In one study , which included a limited RNAi library targeting 1011 genes with a focus on protein kinases , it was found that cells that were dependent on mutant KRAS genetically interacted with the STK33 serine / threonine kinase as a synthetic lethal partner irrespec - tive of the tissue of origin , whereas STK33 was not required by KRAS - independent cells [ 163 ] . STK33 promotes cancer cell viability in a kinase activity - dependent manner by regulat - ing the suppression of mitochondrial apopto - sis mediated through S6K1 - induced inactiva - tion of the death agonist BAD selectively in mutant KRAS - dependent cells . The synthetic lethality functional screen was important , since there was no alteration in STK33 expression , no mutations , and no transforming activity of STK33 was detected . Hence , with the classical analyses of cancer - causing genes , STK33 would have not been identified . In a second study that included a genome - wide RNAi screen , identi - fication of synthetic lethal interaction partners with the KRAS oncogene was carried out target - ing 32 , 293 unique human transcripts [ 162 ] . The genes identified encode a functionally diverse set of proteins that regulate several biological processes , especially mitotic functions . One of these genes that was characterized in this study was PLK1 , a serine / threonine kinase that plays a key role in mitosis . PLK1 is a component of the anaphase - promoting complex / cyclosome , and the proteasome that , when inhibited , results in prometaphase accumulation and the subsequent death of Ras mutant cells . Results from this study demonstrated that reduced expression of genes in this pathway correlated with increased survival of patients bearing tumors with a Ras transcriptional signature . Pharmacological inhibitors of PLK1 and other mitotic proteins can selectively impair the via - bility of Ras mutant cells and be exploited for therapeutic purposes . A third study of a limited RNAi screen to identify synthetic lethal partners of mutant KRAS found the non - canonical I k B kinase , TBK1 [ 164 ] . TBK1 is a serine / threonine kinase that can activate the NF - k B transcription factor and support cell survival . TBK1 was selectively essential in cells that harbor mutant KRAS . Interestingly , TBK1 was identified previously as a key downstream effector of RalB - dependent tumor cell survival [ 166 ] . Suppression of TBK1 induced apoptosis specifically in human can - cer cell lines that depend on oncogenic KRAS expression . In conclusion , the synthetic lethal screening identified TBK1 and NF - k B signaling essential in KRAS mutant tumors . In a fourth study , instead of using RNAi screening to identify synthetic lethal screening partners with mutant KRAS as described in the previous three studies , the focus was to iden - tify a gene signature for KRAS dependency [ 167 ] . Comparing two classes of cancer cells that do or do not require K - Ras to maintain viability revealed a gene expression signature in K - Ras - dependent cells . Two of the genes that were found to encode pharmacologically tractable proteins were the Syk and Ron tyrosine kinases . To validate this screen , the study demonstrated that KRAS mutant tumor cell lines were more sensitive to induction of apoptosis by treatment with a small - molecule inhibitor of Syk . While further validation of these synthetic lethal partners of mutant KRAS are needed , these studies support the potential usefulness Key Terms Oncogene addiction : Dependence of a cancer cell on an overactive protein or signaling pathway necessary for cell survival and growth . Usually , this is due to mutational activation or overexpression . This greater dependence is proposed to account for why molecularly targeted therapies ( e . g . , trastuzumab and imatinib , erlotinib ) can preferentially block cancer versus normal cell proliferation and survival . Synthetic lethality : Two genes are synthetic lethal if mutation of either alone is compatible with viability but mutation of both leads to death . Therefore , targeting a gene ( e . g . , by RNA interference ) that is synthetic lethal to a cancer cell - specific genetic mutation ( e . g . , RAS activation ) should kill only cancer cells with that genetic mutation and spare normal cells . Synthetic lethality , therefore , provides a conceptual framework for the identification of cancer cell - selective targets for anticancer drug discovery . Inhibition of Ras for cancer treatment : the search continues | R eview www . future - science . com 1803 future science group of synthetic lethality screens in identifying novel targets and directions for anti - Ras drug discovery . However , caution for this approach is also raised by a recent study that utilized both genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of STK33 and reached a conclusion that conflicts with the earlier library screening study [ 163 ] . Instead , they concluded that STK33 function is not essential for KRAS mutant - dependent human tumor cells [ 168 ] . Future perspectives Despite the limited success from almost three decades of anti - Ras research and drug dis - covery , substantial progress has been made in understanding Ras biology and function that will shorten the final path to clinically effec - tive anti - Ras drugs . First , a bitter lesson learned from the development of FTIs is the fact that the three RAS genes do not encode function - ally identical proteins . This has resulted in a shift in research and drug - discovery efforts that are now focused on K - Ras . Second , with the unexpected findings made with Raf and MEK inhibitors , a better appreciation for the complex and dynamic nature of signaling net - works has been made , where the Raf – MEK – ERK cascade is not a simple linear pathway . Understanding how the cancer cell can adapt to inhibition of one specific signaling protein will help focus future efforts on approaches that target specific signaling networks at multiple levels . Third , while the limitations of the clas - sical tumor cell line xenograft tumor models have long been appreciated , early observations made with newer mouse models will acceler - ate the transition to greater reliance on geneti - cally engineered mouse models of cancer to more accurately predict drug response in the patient . Finally , the continued development and application of genome - wide unbiased func - tional screening efforts will lead to novel and unexpected new directions for anti - Ras drug discovery . The fact that these efforts have iden - tified protein kinases may render Ras a more tractable target . As we stay optimistic about Ras becoming a ‘tractable’ druggable target in the future , one has to keep in the mind the well - known adage , “nothing worth having comes easy” .

KRAS is the most commonly mutated RAS gene , and the predominant isoform mutated in lung , colorectal and pancreatic cancers . Limited evidence also suggests that the three RAS genes are not functionally equivalent . Thus , while HRAS was traditionally the most intensely studied , recent studies have now shifted the focus to KRAS .  To date , efforts to develop direct antagonists of mutant Ras proteins have not been successful . GTP - competitive inhibitors are not feasible due to the picomolar binding affinity for GTP binding . However , with new technology and information , it remains possible that such approaches can still be identified .  Although all Ras proteins are modified by FTase , the Ras isoforms most commonly mutated in human cancers ( K - Ras and N - Ras ) can be modified by GGTase - I when FTase activity is blocked , resulting in alternative prenylation by the related geranylgeranyl isoprenoid lipid . Despite this clear biochemical explanation for the failure of farnesytransferase inhibitors , there remains a misconception that these failed efforts suggest that Ras is not a clinically useful anticancer target .  Currently , the most promising approaches for blocking mutant Ras signaling involve inhibitors of Raf or PI3K effector signaling . Combination approaches that block a single effector signaling network at multiple points , or that block two distinct effector signaling networks , are believed to be the most promising directions for these efforts .  Recently , functional RNA interference screens have been performed to identify synthetic lethal genetic partners of mutant KRAS . Interestingly , these screens have identified protein kinases , thus identifying potentially more tractable directions for the development of anti - Ras inhibitors .
