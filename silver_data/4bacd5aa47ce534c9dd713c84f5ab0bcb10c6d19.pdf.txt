Coat proteins are required for cargo selection and membrane deformation to bud a transport vesicle from a donor compartment . It was once thought that a vesicle must uncoat before it recog - nizes its target membrane . However , recent ﬁndings have revealed a role for the coat in directing a vesicle to its correct intracellular destination . In this review we will discuss the literature that links coat proteins to vesicle targeting events . Introduction The transfer of material between organelles is mediated by carrier vesicles that continually bud from one membrane and fuse with another . In the past few decades , consider - able progress has been made in identifying the molecular machinery that maintains and regulates membrane trafﬁc ( for a review see Bonifacino and Glick , 2004 ; Mellman and Warren , 2000 ) . Each vesicle transport reaction can be divided into four essential steps that include vesicle bud - ding , transport , tethering , and fusion ( Bonifacino and Glick , 2004 ) . These steps are tightly regulated to ensure that vesicles generated from a donor compartment are delivered to their correct acceptor compartment . Although much has been learned about these processes , exactly howacarriervesicleﬁndsandfuseswithitstargetorganelle remains an unanswered question . In this review we will discuss how tethering factors may work together with coat proteins to mediate the intracellu - lar targeting of vesicles . Coat proteins , which are required for vesicle budding and cargo selection , have recently been shown to play an important role in tethering a vesicle to its correct target membrane ( Cai et al . , 2007 ) . Four Essential Steps in Vesicle Transport Vesicle budding is mediated by protein coats ( Bonifacino and Lippincott - Schwartz , 2003 ; Kirchhausen , 2000 ; McMahon and Mills , 2004 ) . Protein coats are dynamic structures that cycle on and off membranes . They are re - cruited from the cytosol onto donor membranes by small GTPases of the Arf1 / Sar1 family that regulate their assem - bly ( Springer et al . , 1999 ) . Coats deform ﬂat membranes into round buds , which leads to the release of coated ves - icles ( Figure 1 ) . Coat proteins also participate in cargo se - lection through the recognition of sorting signals present in the cytoplasmic domain of transmembrane cargo pro - teins . Clathrin was the ﬁrst coat to be identiﬁed ( Pearse , 1975 ) . Clathrin - coated vesicles are mainly derived from the plasma membrane or the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) and are transported to endosomes ( Owen et al . , 2004 ) . Subsequent studies identiﬁed two nonclathrin coats , COPI ( coat protein complex I ) and COPII ( coat protein complex II ) , that mediate vesicle transport in the early se - cretory pathway . COPI primarily acts from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and between Golgi cisternae , while COPII mediates trafﬁc from the ER to the Golgi ( Barlowe et al . , 1994 ; Letourneur et al . , 1994 ; Waters et al . , 1991 ) . In the last decade , several other nonclathrin coats have been identiﬁed ( Godi et al . , 2004 ; Seaman et al . , 1998 ; Wang et al . , 2006 ) . After budding , vesicles are transported to their ﬁnal des - tination by diffusion or by motor - mediated transport along a cytoskeletal track ( microtubules or actin , see Figure 1 ) . The molecular motors kinesin , dynein , and myosin have all been implicated in this process ( Hammer and Wu , 2002 ; Matanis et al . , 2002 ; Short et al . , 2002 ) . The third step in vesicle - mediated membrane trafﬁc is tethering ( Figure 1 ) . Tethering is a term used to describe the initial interaction between a vesicle and its target membrane . It precedes the pairing of transmembrane SNAREs ( soluble N - ethylma - leimide - sensitive factor attachment protein receptor ) on apposing membranes , an event that leads to membrane fusion ( So¨llner et al . , 1993 ) . Proteins and protein complexes called tethers or tethering factors have been identiﬁed in nearly all membrane - trafﬁcking events ( Sztul and Lupashin , 2006 ; Whyte and Munro , 2002 ) . Together with Rabs , small GTPases of the Ras superfamily , tethers play a critical role in determining the speciﬁcity of vesicle targeting . The last step in vesicle - mediated transport is the fusion of the vesicle with its target membrane ( Figure 1 ) . Fusion is thought to occur by the pairing of SNAREs , a family of membrane proteins that are related to three different neu - ronal proteins : synaptobrevin , syntaxin , and SNAP - 25 . A SNARE on a transport vesicle ( v - SNARE ) pairs with its cognate SNARE - binding partner ( t - SNARE ) on the Developmental Cell 12 , May 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . 671 appropriate target membrane ( Rothman , 1994 ; So¨llner et al . , 1993 ) . The energy derived from the assembly of the SNARE complex has been postulated to drive the fu - sion of two lipid bilayers ( Hanson et al . , 1997 ; Lin and Scheller , 1997 ) . However , factors acting downstream from the SNAREs may also contribute to membrane fusion ( Muller et al . , 2002 ; Ungermann et al . , 1998 ) . While the speciﬁc role of the SNAREs in membrane fusion remains to be determined , there is little doubt they play a key role in this process . For a recent review on SNAREs and their role in membrane fusion , see Jahn and Scheller ( 2006 ) . The pairing of SNAREs was once postulated to drive the speciﬁcity of vesicle targeting ( So¨llner et al . , 1993 ) . How - ever , several lines of evidence indicate this is not the case . First , since SNAREs are recycled after each fusion event , the same SNARE will be present on both antero - grade - and retrograde - directed vesicles . Thus , the mere presence of a SNARE cannot be the sole determinant of the direction in which a vesicle is traveling . Furthermore , the interactions of SNAREs are promiscuous ( Tsui and Banﬁeld , 2000 ; von Mollard et al . , 1997 ) , and the disrup - tion of SNARE complex formation does not block vesicle tethering ( Broadie et al . , 1995 ; Hunt et al . , 1994 ) . These ﬁndings indicate that SNAREs do not mediate the ﬁrst point of contact between a vesicle and its target . Instead , tethers , which act upstream of the SNAREs , appear to perform this function . The Structure of Multisubunit Tethers Although tethers are required for the initial interaction of a carrier vesicle with its target membrane , not all putative tethers have been shown to bind to vesicles . Almost all tethering factors fall into two broad categories : long puta - tive coiled - coil proteins and multisubunit complexes . This review will focus on the role of multisubunit complexes in vesicle tethering . The interaction of coats with tethers is best documented with this class of tethers . All large multisubunit complexes implicated in tethering were ﬁrst found in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( forreviewseeWhyteandMunro , 2002 ) . Todateeightcon - served complexes ( COG , CORVET , Dsl1 , exocyst , GARP / VFT , HOPS / Class C VPS , TRAPPI , and TRAPPII ) acting in exocytic and endocytic trafﬁcking events have been iden - tiﬁed ( see Figure 2 ) . Five of these complexes are required for secretion in vivo : TRAPPI ( ER - Golgi ) , Dsl1 ( Golgi - ER ) , TRAPPII ( intra - Golgi / endosome - late Golgi ) , COG ( endo - some - early Golgi ) , and the exocyst ( Golgi - plasma mem - brane ; endosome - plasma membrane ) ( Andag et al . , 2001 ; Cai et al . , 2005 ; Munson and Novick , 2006 ; Reilly et al . , 2001 ; TerBush et al . , 1996 ; Whyte and Munro , 2001 ) . Three of these complexes are required for vacuolar protein sorting in vivo : CORVET ( late Golgi - endosome ) , HOPS ( endosome - vacuole ) and GARP / VFT ( endosome - late Golgi ) ( Conibear et al . , 2003 ; Peplowska et al . , 2007 ; Peterson and Emr , 2001 ) . The HOPS complex is also re - quired for vacuole - vacuole fusion ( Price et al . , 2000 ) . The exocyst is needed for polarized growth , and it tethers a variety of vesicles to exocytic sites ( Munson and Novick , 2006 ) . Thus , some tethers act in only one trafﬁcking event , while others may participate in more than one . Structurally the best characterized tethering complexes are the (cid:2) 300 kDa TRAPPI complex ( Sacher et al . , 2001 ) Figure 1 .

Developmental Cell Review and the exocyst ( TerBush et al . , 1996 ) . Yeast TRAPPI has recently been visualized by single - particle electron microscopy ( Kim et al . , 2006 ) . It is a ﬂattened dumbbell ( (cid:2) 65 3 65 3 180 A˚ ) with two lobes . High - resolution struc - tures for subcomplexes of vertebrate TRAPPI were mod - eled into the EM reconstruction . The trs20 - trs31 - bet3 heterotrimer was ﬁt into one lobe , while the bet3 - trs33 - bet5 heterotrimer was ﬁt into the other lobe ( Figure 3A ) . The two lobes of TRAPPI are linked together by the trs23 subunit ( Kim et al . , 2006 ) . The signiﬁcance of the presence of bet3 in each lobe of TRAPPI will be addressed below when we discuss the interactions of tethers with coat proteins . TRAPPII contains all the subunits found in TRAPPI , plus three additional proteins ( trs130 , trs120 , and trs65 ) ( Sacher et al . , 2001 ) . The exocyst is a hetero - octameric (cid:2) 750 kDa complex with subunits that range in size from 50 to 150 kDa ( Guo et al . , 1999 ; TerBush et al . , 1996 ) . Quick - freeze / deep - etch / rotary - shadow electron micrographs demonstrated that the mammalian exocyst consists of 4 – 6 ‘‘arms . ’’ Each arm , which is 35 – 70 A ˚ wide and 100 – 300 A ˚ long , emanates from a central point ( Hsu et al . , 1998 ) . In sam - ples treated with glutaraldehyde , the exocyst looks like a tree . The arms coalesce to a thicker long trunk ( (cid:2) 300 A ˚ ) with two ﬂexibly disposed long branches ( (cid:2) 100 A ˚ ) . The crystal structure of the Exo70 subunit ( see Figure 3B ) revealed it to be a long rod ( (cid:2) 160 A˚ ) composed of contig - uous a - helical bundles ( Dong et al . , 2005 ; Hamburger et al . , 2006 ) . The C termini of three other exocyst subunits ( Drosophila Sec15 , yeast Exo84 , and Sec6 ; shown in Figure 3B ) were shown to be shorter rods composed of contiguous a - helical bundles ( Dong et al . , 2005 ; Sivaram et al . , 2006 ; Wu et al . , 2005 ) . These structures , together with secondary structure predictions , were the basis for proposing that all exocyst subunits are elongated with related folds ( Dong et al . , 2005 ) . Two or more of these rods may be aligned in forming the ‘‘trunk’’ and the ‘‘branches’’ of the exocyst . Based on regions of weak sequence similarity to exo - cyst subunits , it was proposed that two other tethering complexes , the hetero - octameric COG complex and the heterotetrameric GARP / VFT complex , are structurally and functionally similar to the exocyst ( Whyte and Munro , 2001 ) . Secondary structure algorithms for COG subunits suggest that , like exocyst subunits , COG subunits are a - helical . However , quick - freeze / deep - etch / rotary - shadow electron micrographs of glutaraldehyde - ﬁxed mammalian COG subunits showed a bilobed assembly that differs from the exocyst ( Ungar et al . , 2002 ) . Protein - protein inter - action studies suggest that each lobe contains a heterotri - meric COG subcomplex . The COG1 / COG8 heterodimer bridges the two lobes of the complex ( Fotso et al . , 2005 ; Ungar et al . , 2005 ) . Thus , the architecture of the COG complex superﬁcially resembles TRAPPI rather than the exocyst . TRAPPI and COG are similar in that they appear to mediate a single tethering event , while the exocyst Figure 2 .

The CORVET complex may be required for tethering events between the trans - Golgi and endosome , while HOPS functions between the endosome and vacuole . HOPS also has been implicated in homotypic vacuole fusion . The exocyst complex binds to post - Golgi and recycling vesicles at the plasma membrane .

A growing body of evidence implies that tethering is a multistep process that is mediated through interactions with coat proteins , tethers , Rabs , and SNAREs . In the following sections we will review this literature . Tethers Can Be Rab Effectors and Rab Exchange Factors Rabs are small GTPases of the Ras superfamily that continuously cycle between the cytosol and membranes . In the cytosol , the GDP - bound form of the Rab is com - plexedwithGDI ( guaninenucleotidedissociationinhibitor ) . Rabs are recruited to membranes with the aid of a GDF ( GDI displacement factor ) ( Dirac - Svejstrup et al . , 1997 ) and are inserted into the membrane via a prenyl group . The membrane - bound Rab is then activated by a speciﬁc GEF ( guanine nucleotide exchange factor ) through the exchange of GDP for GTP ( Soldati et al . , 1994 ; Ullrich et al . , 1994 ) . Upon activation , the Rab interacts with down - stream effectors . Activation of the Rab is terminated when GTP hydrolysis is stimulated by a speciﬁc GAP ( GTPase - activating protein ) ( Rybinet al . , 1996 ) . Todate , 11Rabpro - teins have been identiﬁed in yeast , and > 60 in mammalian cells ( Lazar et al . , 1997 ; Pfeffer , 2001 ) . Do Rabs regulate only one trafﬁcking step , or can the same Rab be required in multiple trafﬁcking events ? Ini - tially it was thought that each trafﬁcking event is regulated by a speciﬁc Rab . However , now it is clear this is not the case . In fact , genetic studies in yeast imply that some Rabs , like Ypt1p ( Rab1 in mammals ) , act at multiple stages of the exocyctic and endocytic pathway ( Bacon et al . , 1989 ; Finger and Novick , 2000 ) . In vivo and in vitro studies have conﬁrmed that Ypt1p ( Rab1 ) is required for ER - to - Golgi trafﬁc , intra - Golgi trafﬁc , and membrane re - cycling through the early endosome ( Bacon et al . , 1989 ; Baker et al . , 1990 ; Davidson and Balch , 1993 ; Jedd et al . , 1995 ; Lafourcade et al . , 2004 ) . For a recent review of Rabs and their role in membrane trafﬁc , see Grosshans et al . ( 2006 ) . The best understood function of Rab proteins is proba - bly their role in vesicle tethering . The earliest evidence for the involvement of Rabs in vesicle tethering and fusion was the observation that mutations in the gene that en - codes the Rab GTPase SEC4 lead to the accumulation Figure 3 . Structures of Tethering Complexes ( A ) High - resolution structures of mammalian TRAPP subcomplexes bet3 / trs31 / trs20 and bet3 / trs33 / bet5 / trs23 have been determined ( Kim et al . , 2006 ) . bet3 , trs31 , and trs33 have similar folds , as do trs20 , trs23 , and bet5 .

The fragments are colored from blue at their N termini to red at their C termini . 674 Developmental Cell 12 , May 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . Developmental Cell Review of post - Golgi vesicles in yeast ( Salminen and Novick , 1987 ) . With the development of in vitro transport assays , other Rabs were shown to participate in vesicle tethering . The yeast homotypic vacuole - fusion assay revealed that Ypt7p is needed at a step that precedes SNARE complex formation ( Mayer and Wickner , 1997 ; Ungermann et al . , 1998 ) . Subsequently , the Rab Ypt1p was shown to be required for the tethering of ER - derived COPII vesicles in vitro ( Cao et al . , 1998 ) . Rabs in their GTP - bound form appear to facilitate the recruitment of tethers to speciﬁc locations . A well - studied example of a tether that is a Rab effector is the exocyst complex . As mentioned above , the exocyst localizes to sites of polarized growth in yeast and is required to tether post - Golgi and recycling vesicles to the plasma mem - brane ( Munson and Novick , 2006 ; TerBush et al . , 1996 ) . Most exocyst subunits are delivered on post - Golgi vesi - cles to exocytic sites ( Boyd et al . , 2004 ) . They are recruited to vesicles via an interaction between the exocyst subunit Sec15p and the GTP - bound form of the Rab Sec4p ( Guo et al . , 1999 ) . Two other exocyst subunits , Sec3p and Exo70p , localize to the plasma membrane independent of the cytoskeleton and ongoing membrane trafﬁc ( Boyd et al . , 2004 ; Finger et al . , 1998 ) . The exocyst complex forms at the cell surface when post - Golgi vesicles tether to the plasma membrane ( Boyd et al . , 2004 ) . In epithelial cells , the exocyst is required for the transport of proteins to the basolateral cell surface ( Grindstaff et al . , 1998 ) . The COG and GARP / VFT complexes ( Figure 2 ) are also Rab effectors . COG is a multisubunit tethering complex that mediates membrane trafﬁc at the Golgi apparatus . The yeast COG complex ( also called the Sec34p / Sec35p complex ) is a Ypt1p effector that has been pro - posed to tether vesicles from the late Golgi / early endo - some to the early Golgi ( Suvorova et al . , 2002 ; Whyte and Munro , 2001 ) . GARP / VFT binds to the GTP form of Ypt6p and plays a role in retrograde trafﬁc from endo - somestothetrans - Golgi ( Conibearetal . , 2003 ; Quenneville et al . , 2006 ; Siniossoglou and Pelham , 2001 ) . The HOPS complex is the only tethering factor shown to act as an effector of a Rab ( Ypt7p ) and as a GEF . Homo - typic vacuole fusion occurs in ordered steps that includes priming , tethering , docking , and fusion . Proteins that reg - ulate this process assemble into a ‘‘vertex ring’’ around the apposed membranes of tethered vacuoles before fu - sion occurs ( Fratti et al . , 2004 ; Wang et al . , 2002 , 2003 ) . Ypt7p and HOPS are required for the homotypic fusion of yeast vacuoles and the fusion of transport vesicles to the vacuole ( Haas et al . , 1995 ; Mayer and Wickner , 1997 ; Price et al . , 2000 ; Seals et al . , 2000 ; Wichmann et al . , 1992 ; Wurmser et al . , 2000 ) . The HOPS subunit , Vps39p , converts Ypt7p from its GDP - bound form to its GTP - bound form to promote vesicle tethering ( Price et al . , 2000 ; Seals et al . , 2000 ; Wurmser et al . , 2000 ) . HOPS shares four subunits , Vps11p , Vps16p , Vps18p , and Vps33p , with the newly identiﬁed CORVET complex . CORVET binds to GTP - bound Vps21p , the Rab5 homolog in yeast ( Peplowska et al . , 2007 ) . Interestingly , human homologs of Vps11p , Vps16p , and Vps18p are also com - ponents of a mammalian complex that binds to Rab5 - GTP ( Rink et al . , 2005 ) . These recent ﬁndings suggest that the HOPS and CORVET complexes play a role in tethering events that lead to endosome - vacuole ( lysosomes in mammals ) biogenesis in both yeast and mammalian cells . One of the other subunits of the CORVET complex , Vps3p , has an afﬁnity for Vps21p - GDP ( Peplowska et al . , 2007 ) . This observation led to the suggestion that Vps3p is an exchange factor for Vps21p . Additional biochemical stud - ies will be needed to test this proposal . Vps9p , which is not a component of the CORVET or HOPS complexes , is an established Vps21p exchange factor ( Hama et al . , 1999 ) . All tethers discussed in this review article are Rab effectors , except for the TRAPP complexes . In 2001 , the tethers TRAPPI and TRAPPII were identiﬁed as exchange factors that speciﬁcally activate Ypt1p ( Sacher et al . , 2001 ; Wang et al . , 2000 ) . TRAPPI only functions in ER - to - Golgi trafﬁc ( Sacher et al . , 2001 ) , while TRAPPII regulates intra - Golgi trafﬁc and trafﬁc from the early endo - some to the late Golgi in vivo ( Cai et al . , 2005 ; Sacher et al . , 2001 ) . Interestingly , ﬁve TRAPP subunits are needed to fully reconstitute Ypt1p exchange activity in vitro ( Cai et al . , 2007 ; Kim et al . , 2006 ) , and all of these subunits are shared between TRAPPI and TRAPPII . This ﬁnding ﬁts well with the observation that both TRAPPI and TRAPPII are Ypt1p exchange factors ( Sacher et al . , 2001 ) . The activation of Ypt1p by two distinct but related exchange factors may explain how this small GTPase can function in different transport events . However , it has recently been reported that TRAPPII is not a Ypt1p exchange fac - tor , but instead activates Ypt31p / Ypt32p ( Morozova et al . , 2006 ) . Yeast must contain a Ypt31p / Ypt32p exchange factor distinct from TRAPPII , as previous studies demon - strated that the depletion of TRAPP from yeast lysates results in the loss of Ypt1p , but not Ypt31p / Ypt32p , ex - changeactivity ( Wangetal . , 2000 ; WangandFerro - Novick , 2002 ) . Additional experiments will be needed to resolve these discrepancies and to determine if TRAPPII acts as a Ypt1p or a Ypt31p / Ypt32p exchange factor in vivo . Tethers Interact with Coat Proteins to Mediate Vesicle Tethering Vesicle coats are multilayered complexes ( for review see Gurkan et al . , 2006 ) . One layer includes adaptor protein ( AP ) complexes that recognize and select cargo mole - cules . Another layer includes cage proteins ( CPs ) . CPs assemble into a lattice on the membrane surface to form a scaffold that collects AP - cargo complexes . This links cargo concentration with membrane deformation , which eventually leads to the formation of coated vesicles . As we discuss here , many tethers show biochemical interac - tions with coat proteins . The depletion of the mammalian COG3 subunit in HeLa cells results in the accumulation of COPI - coated , COG - complex - dependent ( CCD ) vesicles carrying the intra - Golgi SNAREs GS15 and GS28 . Anterograde trafﬁcking of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein to the plasma mem - brane was maintained in COG3 - depleted cells , while the Developmental Cell 12 , May 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . 675 Developmental Cell Review retrograde trafﬁc of Shiga toxin was inhibited . Additionally , mammalian COG bound to isolated CCD vesicles , and both mammalian and yeast COG showed speciﬁc interac - tions with COPI subunits ( Suvorova et al . , 2002 ; Zolov and Lupashin , 2005 ) . These studies led to the conclusion that the cis - Golgi - localized COG complex tethers retrograde COPI vesicles that bud from a trans - Golgi / endosomal compartment ( Zolov and Lupashin , 2005 ) . Speciﬁc interactions with COPI subunits were also observed with two other putative tethering complexes , TRAPPII and Dsl1 . TRAPPII localizes to the late Golgi / early endosome ( Cai et al . , 2005 ; Yu et al . , 2006 ) . Mutations in genes that encode two different TRAPPII - speciﬁc sub - units ( TRS130 and TRS120 ) have somewhat different phenotypes . Mutations in trs130 block intra - Golgi and endocytic trafﬁc , while mutations in trs120 only block en - docytic trafﬁc . TRAPPII also interacts with COPI in yeast lysates , and COPI subunits are mislocalized in trs120 mu - tants ( Cai et al . , 2005 ) . A putative role for TRAPPII is to tether vesicles that recycle through the early endosome and Golgi ( Cai et al . , 2005 ) . Dsl1 is a large ER - localized complex implicated in the tethering of retrograde COPI vesicles that direct trafﬁc from the Golgi to the ER ( Andag et al . , 2001 ; Reilly et al . , 2001 ) . The central acidic domain of the Dsl1p component interacts in vitro with the d - and a - subunits of the COPI coat . The d - subunit is a constituent of the F subcomplex of COPI that shares sequence similarities with clathrin adaptor components . The a - COPI subunit belongs to the B subcomplex of the COPI coat , which is thought to function like clathrin ( Andag and Schmitt , 2003 ) . Thus , Dsl1p interacts with both the F and B subcomplexes of the COPI vesicle coat . While several different large tethering complexes have been shown to interact with coat subunits and coat complexes , the function of these interactions has been unclear . Direct evidence that coat proteins play a role in vesicle tethering has come from a recent study that de - ﬁned the TRAPPI - binding partner on COPII vesicles ( Cai et al . , 2007 ) . The formation of COPII vesicles is initiated when the small GTPase Sar1p recruits the cargo adaptor complex Sec23p / Sec24p ( Yoshihisa et al . , 1993 ) . This leads to the capture of transmembrane cargo by Sec24p ( Kuehn et al . , 1998 ; Miller et al . , 2003 ) . Sec23p / Sec24p then recruits the Sec13p / Sec31p complex , which induces coat polymerization and membrane deformation ( Stagg et al . , 2006 ) . In yeast , COPII vesicles are believed to tether and fuse directly with the cis - Golgi ( Baker et al . , 1988 ; Ruohola et al . , 1988 ) . In mammalian cells , COPII vesicle tethering is thought to be largely a homotypic event ( Xu and Hay , 2004 ) . Homotypic COPII vesicle fusion results in the formation of membrane structures called VTCs ( vesicular tubular clusters ) , which are the compartments where soluble cargo concentrates ( Martinez - Menarguez et al . , 1999 ) . Anterograde cargo then moves from VTCs to the cis - Golgi ( Ben - Tekaya et al . , 2005 ; Presley et al . , 1997 ; Scales et al . , 1997 ) . TRAPPI is a stage - speciﬁc tether that binds directly to COPII vesicles ( Sacher et al . , 2001 ) . The most conserved component of the TRAPPI complex is Bet3 , as yeast and mammalian Bet3 ( mBet3 ) are 54 % identical ( Sacher et al . , 1998 ) . Immuno - EM studies demonstrated that mBet3 resides on COPII - coated vesicles and COPII bud - ding proﬁles , and in vitro mBet3 is required for homotypic COPII vesicle tethering ( Yu et al . , 2006 ) . Additional studies demonstrated that Bet3 mediates COPII vesicle tethering via an interaction with the coat subunit Sec23 in both yeast and mammalian cells ( Cai et al . , 2007 ) . These ﬁndings link vesicle budding to tethering and show that the mechanism of COPII vesicle tethering is conserved between yeast and mammals . The structure of TRAPPI ( Kim et al . , 2006 ) is consistent with a homotypic tethering model where a copy of Bet3 , in each of the two lobes of the TRAPPI com - plex , interacts with a different coated vesicle to bring two vesicles together . Although TRAPPI and TRAPPII share seven subunits , only TRAPPI binds to COPII vesicles ( Sacher et al . 2001 ) . One or more of the three TRAPPII - speciﬁc subunits must mask the Sec23p - binding site on Bet3p . Recently , another putative tethering factor that participates in ER - to - Golgi trafﬁc , Grh1p ( yeast homolog of GRASP65 ) , was reported to interact with the Sec23p / Sec24p complex ( Behnia et al . , 2007 ) . Although it was long thought that the vesicle coat is re - moved soon after the carrier vesicle is formed ( see review in Bonifacino and Glick , 2004 ) , these new ﬁndings imply that vesicles remain coated until the coat is recognized by a speciﬁc tether . The observation that TRAPPI binds to a component of a cargo adaptor complex links vesicle tethering to cargo recognition . This ﬁnding provides a sim - ple mechanism to explain how the directionality of vesicle transport is maintained . It also suggests that tethering factors may integrate the recognition of a vesicle to the process of vesicle uncoating . The molecular mechanism by which vesicle uncoating is regulated is still unclear . The disassembly of the COPI and COPII coats is thought to occur subsequent to the hydro - lysis of GTP by the Arf1 / Sar1 family of proteins . In the case of the COPII coat , Sec23p is the GAP for Sar1p , and this GAP activity is further stimulated by the Sec13p / Sec31p complex ( Antonny et al . , 2001 ; Yoshihisa et al . , 1993 ) . Although GTP hydrolysis is required for COPII vesicle uncoating , the COPII coat remains associated with vesi - cles for a considerable amount of time after Sar1p is hydrolyzed ( Barlowe et al . , 1994 ) . The binding of secretory cargo to the coat cargo adaptor complex stabilizes the COPII coat on vesicles after Sar1p is released from mem - branes ( Forster et al . , 2006 ; Sato and Nakano , 2005 ) . It was initially thought that ArfGAP1 induces COPI vesicle uncoating ( Bremser et al . , 1999 ; Goldberg , 1999 ; Reinhard et al . , 2003 ) . However , more recent ﬁndings have revealed that ArfGAP1 functions as a basic compo - nent of the COPI coat . In vitro studies have demonstrated that the incorporation of cargo into COPI vesicles depends on the hydrolysis of ARF1 - GTP ( Lanoix et al . , 1999 ; Nickel et al . , 1998 ) . When ArfGAP1 , ARF1 , and coat - omer were used to reconstitute vesicle formation , puriﬁed COPI coated vesicles were depleted of ARF1 and enriched in ArfGAP1 ( Yang et al . , 2002 ) . 676 Developmental Cell 12 , May 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . Developmental Cell Review Tethers Interact with SNAREs How do tethering factors coordinate the recognition of a vesicle to the process of membrane fusion ? Many tethers physically interact with SNAREs . Tethering factors may bring the vesicle in closer contact with its target com - partment after vesicle uncoating ( Malsam et al . , 2005 ) to increase the probability of SNARE interactions . Alterna - tively , tethering factors may actively promote SNARE - mediated membrane fusion by stimulating the formation of trans - SNARE complexes ( Shorter et al . , 2002 ) . Studies on the well - characterized coiled - coil tether , p115 , support both models . Rab1 - GTP recruits p115 onto COPII vesicles as vesicles bud from the ER ( Allan et al . , 2000 ) . On vesicles , p115 interacts with a select set of COPII vesicle - associated SNAREs ( Allan et al . , 2000 ) . The recruitment of p115 to membranes is dependent on SNAREs and is required for COPII vesicle tethering and VTC formation ( Bentley et al . , 2006 ; Brandon et al . , 2006 ) . The most amino - terminal coiled - coil region of p115 , which is weakly homologous to a SNARE motif ( Weimbs et al . , 1997 ) , also stimulates SNARE complex as - sembly ( Shorter et al . , 2002 ) . Therefore , p115 may not only tether vesicles to their target membrane via an interaction with SNAREs , it also catalyzes SNARE - mediated mem - brane fusion . Uso1p , the yeast homolog of p115 , is also required for the assembly of the ER - to - Golgi SNARE com - plex in vivo ( Sapperstein et al . , 1996 ) . Thus , in addition to participating in fusion , the SNAREs appear to act up - stream of fusion to recruit tethering machinery . Another example of a tether interacting with a SNARE is the GARP / VFT complex subunit Vps51p that binds to the N - terminal domain of the SNARE Tlg1p ( Conibear et al . , 2003 ; Siniossoglou and Pelham , 2001 ) . GARP / VFT , which localizes to the late Golgi in a Ypt6p - dependent fashion ( Siniossoglou and Pelham , 2001 ) , has been implicated in tethering endosomal derived vesicles to the late Golgi via an interaction with Tlg1p ( Conibear et al . , 2003 ; Coni - bear and Stevens , 2000 ) . Since Tlg1p is present on Golgi membranes as well , an alternative model is that Tlg1p is a receptor for GARP / VFT on the Golgi . In either case , it is possible that GARP / VFT interacts with Tlg1p to stimu - late SNARE complex formation . Tlg1p has an N - terminal domain that forms a three - helix bundle . Like other syntax - ins , it has been suggested that the function of Tlg1p is Figure 4 . Vesicles Tether via an Interaction with Coat Proteins ( A ) In homotypic tethering , the tether ( blueves - icle tether ) links two coated vesicles together via an interaction with a coat subunit . This in - teractionismaintainedasregionsofthevesicleuncoatandtheSNAREsareexposed . Other tethers ( red vesicle tether ) may then promote SNARE pairing and membrane fusion . ( B ) In heterotypic tethering , the tether ( blue vesicle tether ) targets the vesicle to its accep - tor compartment through a direct interaction with a coat subunit . As the vesicle uncoats , theSNAREs areexposed . Thisisthenfollowed by the formation of trans - SNARE pairs ( red vesicle tether ) and membrane fusion . Developmental Cell 12 , May 2007 ª 2007 Elsevier Inc . 677 Developmental Cell Review autoinhibited through an interaction of its N - terminal domain with its C - terminal SNARE motif ( Misura et al . , 2000 ) . Vps51p may release this autoinhibition as its N ter - minus binds to the N - terminal domain of Tlg1p ( Conibear et al . , 2003 ; Fridmann - Sirkis et al . , 2006 ; Siniossoglou and Pelham , 2001 ) . However , deletions or point mutations that eliminate the binding of Vps51p to Tlg1p do not affect the recycling of proteins from endosomes to the Golgi in vivo ( Fridmann - Sirkis et al . , 2006 ) . These ﬁndings imply that the binding of Tlg1p to Vps51p is not essential for GARP / VFT - mediated vesicle tethering . Tethering factors , like the exocyst and HOPS com - plexes , may promote SNARE - mediated membrane fusion by binding to Sec1 / Munc18 family proteins ( for review see Jahn and Sudhof , 1999 ; Waters and Hughson , 2000 ) . Recent in vitro studies showing that Munc18 binds to fully assembled SNARE complexes to promote membrane fu - sion support this hypothesis ( Dulubova et al . , 2007 ; Shen et al . , 2007 ) . The exocyst binds to Sec1p ( Wiederkehr et al . , 2004 ) , which in turn binds to the fully assembled Snc / Sso / Sec9p exocytic SNARE complex ( Carr et al . , 1999 ) . HOPS is the only multisubunit tethering complex that contains a Sec1 homolog , Vps33p . Vps33p binds to the vacuolar t - SNARE Vam3p ( Laage and Ungermann , 2001 ; Seals et al . , 2000 ; Wang et al . , 2001 ) . There are conﬂicting reports on the signiﬁcance of the HOPS / Vam3p interaction . In one study ( Laage and Ungermann , 2001 ) , deletion of the N - terminal domain of Vam3p was reported to reduce the formation of trans - SNARE com - plexes and homotypic vacuolar fusion in vitro . In another study ( Wang et al . , 2001 ) , deletion of the N - terminal domain of Vam3p did not disrupt fusion in vitro or in vivo . Recently , HOPS has been shown to bind to the SNARE Vam7p . This interaction may play a role in initi - ating SNARE complex assembly ( Stroupe et al . , 2006 ) . The COG and Dsl1 complexes are two other tethering complexes that exhibit speciﬁc interactions with SNAREs . COG interacts with intra - Golgi SNAREs ( Suvorova et al . , 2002 ; Zolov and Lupashin , 2005 ) , and Dsl1 binds to ER - localized SNAREs ( Kraynack et al . , 2005 ) . It has been sug - gested that Dsl1 maintains the stability of an ER - localized SNARE complex that contains Use1p , Ufe1p , and Sec20p ( Kraynack et al . , 2005 ) . Concluding Remarks and Future Perspectives Initially , tethers were proposed to act as structural bridges . It was speculated that a tether on the target mem - brane recognizes and binds to a speciﬁc determinant on the incoming vesicle to form a molecular link that holds two apposing membranes together . Since different tethers act in different places , it has been suggested that the localization of tethers is likely to be dependent on their interaction with either certain lipids or with acti - vated forms of small GTPases . These lipids and GTPases are usually present on a subset of internal membranes , providing each compartment with a unique identity that allows it to be recognized by tethering factors ( Munro , 2002 ) . Tethers must also recognize vesicular compo - nents . Coat proteins are likely candidates , as they bind to cargo and are directly recruited from the cytosol to the compartment where they function . In the past decade , a growing body of evidence has demonstrated that tethers work in conjunction with Rab GTPases and bind to coat proteins . Based on this obser - vation , we propose the following model for vesicle tether - ing . First , we speculate that in homotypic tethering events , the tether binds to two different coated membrane com - partments ( Figure 4A ) . In heterotypic tethering events , only the vesicle would be coated ( Figure 4B ) . In some cases , tethering may be initiated before the Rab is acti - vated ( Cai et al . , 2007 ; Wurmser et al . , 2000 ) . As domains on the vesicle begin to uncoat , Rab - GTP may recruit other tethers that promote SNARE pairing ( Shorter et al . , 2002 ) ( Figure 4 ) . The same tether could act both upstream and downstream of Rab activation , or multiple tethers may participate in these events . For example , in yeast ER - to - Golgi trafﬁc several components have been implicated in tethering COPII vesicles to their acceptor compartment ( Behnia et al . , 2007 ; Cai et al . , 2007 ; Sacher et al . , 2001 ) . Thus , vesicle tethering appears to be a highly regulated process . Additional studies will be needed to determine how coats , tethers , Rabs , and SNAREs work together to control the ﬁdelity of membrane trafﬁc . The ﬁnding that a Rab exchange factor is recruited to vesicles by a coat subunit ( Cai et al . , 2007 ) raises the intriguing possibility that Rabs regulate vesicle uncoating .
