E - mail : suetsugu @ bs . naist . jp Received 22 October 2015 ; Accepted 9 January 2016 Abstract Most cellular organelles contain lipid bilayer membranes . The earliest characterization of cellular organelles was performed by electron microscopy observation of such mem - branes . However , the precise mechanisms for shaping the membrane in particular subcel - lular organelles is poorly understood . Classically , the overall cellular shape , i . e . the shape of the plasma membrane , was thought to be governed by the reorganization of cytoskel - etal components such as actin and microtubules . The plasma membrane contains various submicron structures such as clathrin - coated pits , caveolae , ﬁ lopodia and lamelli - podia . These subcellular structures are either invaginations or protrusions and are associated with the cytoskeleton . Therefore , it could be hypothesized that there are membrane - binding proteins that cooperates with cytoskeleton in shaping of plasma membrane organelles . Proteins with the Bin – Amphiphysin – Rvs ( BAR ) domain connect a variety of membrane shapes to actin ﬁ laments . The BAR domains themselves bend the membranes by their rigidity and then mold the membranes into tubules through their assembly as spiral polymers , which are thought to be involved in the various submicron structures . Membrane tubulation by polymeric assembly of the BAR domains is supposed to be regulated by binding proteins , binding lipids and the mechanical properties of the membrane . This review gives an overview of BAR protein assembly , describes the signi ﬁ cance of the assembly and discusses how to study the assembly in the context of membrane and cellular morphology . The technical problems encountered in microscopic observation of BAR domain assembly are also discussed . Key words : BAR domain , I - BAR domain , F - BAR domain , scission , tubulation , membrane Introduction Most cellular organelles are composed of lipid bilayer membranes . The use of transmission electron microscopy to examine membrane shapes in freeze - fractured cells or ultra - thin sections of cells has promoted the identi ﬁ cation and def - inition of cellular organelles [ 1 , 2 ] . Subsequent development of ﬂ uorescence microscopy , along with the use of ﬂ uorescent proteins such as green ﬂ uorescent protein ( GFP ) , has greatly contributed to the understanding of organelles , based on ﬂ uorescence emission by the proteins upon exposure to exci - tation light . Fluorescence microscopy is a technique that allows the visualization of objects with ﬂ uorescent labeling exclusively , which has helped to study the functions and loca - lizations of numerous important proteins [ 3 – 5 ] .

Cellular membranes are composed of amphipathic lipids that contain a polar head group and two hydrophobic carbon tails ( acyl chains ) , which , in different combinations , have dif - ferent properties [ 6 – 9 ] . The four major lipids are phosphat - idylcholine , phosphatidylethanolamine , phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol , each of which is characterized by their polar head groups . The acyl chains are quite diverse [ 10 ] ; however , the signi ﬁ cance of this diversity in ( sub - ) cellular morphology has only been partially elucidated . In aqueous solution , these amphipathic lipids assemble through hydrophobic interactions , such that lipid molecules are not covalently attached to one another . Therefore , membranes composed of amphipathic lipids behave like bubbles of soap and naturally adopt an amorphous spherical shape [ 11 ] . Cellular membranes are not simply static structures that separate the internal and external compartments of cells . The importance of membrane lipid molecules as intracellu - lar signal molecules under rapid generation and degradation has been extensively studied . One of the earliest and most prominent discoveries was that of the enzyme phospholipase C , which degrades phosphatidyl - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate [ PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] to inositol - 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate [ IP 3 ] and diacylglycerol [ DAG ] [ 12 ] , all three of which regulate a variety of proteins involved in intracellular signal transduction . This pathway highlights the fact that lipids can function as mediators of intracellular signals in various cellular responses , including cellular proliferation and migration [ 8 ] . Furthermore , the importance of lipids as intracellular signaling molecules was con ﬁ rmed by subsequent studies of phosphoinositides , which identi ﬁ ed numerous protein domains that recognize lipid molecules , especially their polar head groups [ 13 ] . Thus , in the case of the actin cytoskeleton , both phosphatidylinositol - 3 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate [ PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ] and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 play essential roles in regulating Neural Wiskott – Aldrich Syndrome Protein ( N - WASP ) and Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein verprolin homologous protein ( WAVE ) , the activators of the actin - related protein ( Arp ) 2 / 3 complex for actin polymerization in lamellipodia and other subcellular structures [ 8 , 14 ] . Moreover , studies of the actin cytoskeleton have shown how the cellular shape is maintained and deformed by the actin cytoskeleton [ 11 ] , and that the actin cytoskeleton does not directly bind to the membrane . Since the actin cytoskeleton is widely present in cells , both temporally and spatially tight regulation of the cytoskeleton is crucial to discriminate among different subcellular organelles . At present , only a limited number of proteins are known to directly manipulate the shape of the membrane by their structures , as compared with proteins that structurally recognize the speci ﬁ c head groups of lipid molecules . The Bin – Amphiphysin – Rvs ( BAR ) domain superfamily proteins include one of the ﬁ rst protein domains shown to directly link the structure ( the shape ) of the protein to the shape of the membrane [ 15 ] . Importantly , the BAR domains are often found together with the SH3 domain and interact with the regulators of the actin cytoskeleton , N - WASP and WAVE , and the membrane scission protein dynamin [ 16 , 17 ] . Our understanding of these features of membrane morphology by these proteins relies on microscopic analysis , and this review also discusses these proteins as objects of microscopic ana - lysis of both electron and light microscopy . The BAR domain as a folding scaffold for membranes BAR domain - containing proteins ( BAR proteins ) were iden - ti ﬁ ed as binding proteins of dynamin that mediate mem - brane scission for endocytosis [ 18 , 19 ] . In addition , the BAR protein amphiphysin in Drosophila was ﬁ rst identi ﬁ ed as a mutant in which the thin membrane T - tubules in muscle cells are disorganized [ 20 ] , whereas Bin1 / M - Amphiphysin2 in human was identi ﬁ ed as a putative tumor suppressor [ 21 ] . Subsequent studies showed the in vitro membrane tubulation ability of the BAR domain through analysis of a Drosophila protein , as well as human proteins [ 20 , 22 ] , strongly suggest - ing their direct involvement in T - tubule biogenesis of muscle [ 23 , 24 ] . We discovered some BAR proteins through screening WASP / WAVE binding proteins [ 25 , 26 ] . The membrane tubulation by the BAR proteins was mostly examined by the observation of negatively stained liposomes ( arti ﬁ cial lipid membrane ) using electron microscopy . The ﬁ rst insight into how the BAR domain can mold the shape of the membrane was provided by the structure of the BAR domain [ 27 ] . It is currently understood that all of the known BAR domains form dimers of helix bundles [ 28 ] . Positively charged amino - acid residues accumulate on par - ticular surfaces of the domains , which are the membrane - binding surfaces ; in contrast , cellular membranes are nega - tively charged due to the presence of phosphatidylserine and phosphorylated phosphatidylinositols ( phosphoinositides ) [ 8 ] . Based on their amino - acid sequence similarities and structural differences , the BAR domains are classi ﬁ ed into the canonical BAR domain , the F - BAR ( FCH - BAR ) domain and the I - BAR ( Inverse BAR or IMD ) domain [ 8 , 17 , 29 ] . In addition , some BAR , F - BAR and I - BAR domains possess amphipathic helices or loops , which are inserted into the mem - brane as described later . Moreover , a large number of BAR domains with various degrees of curvature at the membrane - binding surfaces are involved in various membrane structures such as clathrin - coated pits , caveolae , ﬁ lopodia and lamelli - podia , which are described in a variety of reviews [ 30 – 32 ] . Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain how BAR domains bend the membrane . The ﬁ rst mechanism 2 Microscopy , 2016 , Vol . 0 , No . 0 a t O r t a D ogu T e kn i k U n i v e r s it y L i b r a r y ( OD T U ) on F e b r u a r y 20 , 2016 h tt p : / / j m i c r o . ox f o r d j ou r n a l s . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m involves the rigidity of the protein , i . e . a BAR domain com - posed of an α - helix bundle should be harder to bend than a membrane formed by hydrophobic interactions . The second mechanism involves the higher - order assembly of the BAR domain itself ( Fig . 1 ) . The sizes of membrane tubules and cellular organelles are generally larger than protein sizes . Therefore , higher - order assembly is required to shape mem - branes , such that the BAR domain protein ﬁ laments form decorations on the membrane surfaces and ‘ wrap up ’ part of the subcellular organelles as seen in in vitro membrane tubules [ 33 – 35 ] . Such higher - order assembly of the BAR domain is considered to be important for membrane molding . I will describe in detail on these two mechanisms . The rigidity of the BAR domain It seems to be correct and plausible that a protein with a helix bundle is rigid enough to bend the membrane where the membrane conforms to the relatively large surface of the BAR domain , as compared with the surface of each lipid molecule , thus redistributing the membrane lipids into the shape of the protein [ 36 – 38 ] . Examining the rigidity of protein using experimental approaches is not easily achiev - able , and thus computational approaches , such as molecular dynamic simulations , have been widely applied [ 39 – 41 ] . Molecular dynamic simulations for endophilin and amphi - physin have strongly suggested that the BAR domain func - tions as a rigid scaffold for membrane curvature [ 42 – 46 ] , but more detailed analyses of the structural ﬂ uctuations are required . Whole - atom molecular dynamic simulation revealed rigidity of the F - BAR domain of FBP17 enough to mold the membrane [ 47 ] , thus supporting the idea that the F - BAR domain functions as a molecular ‘ mold ’ or ‘ scaffold ’ for membrane shape . However , the F - BAR domain of FBP17 appears to have some ﬂ uctuation or bending proper - ties [ 47 ] . The extent of helix - bundle ﬂ uctuation in other BAR domains remains unclear , and the roles of ﬂ uctuation in BAR domain shape in shaping of the membrane also remain to be clari ﬁ ed . The assembly of BAR domains into ﬁ lamentous polymers and spirals Studies of the surfaces of BAR domain - induced tubules by cryo - electron microscopy revealed spiral formation by the BAR domains [ 33 – 35 , 48 ] . These observations were ana - lyzed at atomic resolution for the F - BAR domain of FBP17 and the BAR domain of endophilin A1 . Both proteins were assembled on the surface of the tubules by spiral formation , with tip - to - tip and lateral interactions between the dimers . The tip - to - tip interaction of the F - BAR domain was also found in the crystals of CIP4 , and PACSIN2 F - BAR domains [ 33 , 49 ] , suggesting that the interactions observed on the surface of tubules are also present in the crystals . The lateral interactions were different between FBP17 and endo - philin , with no apparent common binding mode between Fig . 1 . Location of BAR domain functions in cells . The BAR domains function as polymers at submicron - scale invaginations , such as clathrin - coated pits and caveolae , as well as in protrusions , including ﬁ lopodia and lamellipodia . The schematic illustration shows the BAR domain localization at plasma membrane invaginations . The typical scales for clathrin - coated pits and caveolae are 100 – 200 and 50 – 100 nm in diameter , respectively . The BAR domains have typically been approximated as arcs of 20 – 25 nm in length with a diameterof 3 – 6 nm . The membrane thickness istypically ∼ 5 nm .

Therefore , spiral formation can be regulated in a manner speci ﬁ c to each BAR domain . It is still unclear how the spiral of the BAR domain is formed on the surface of the tubules . Some BAR domains reportedly form ﬁ lamentous polymers in vitro , as observed for the F - BAR domain of FBP17 [ 50 ] . Filament formation can also occur independently of membrane deformation , as shown by the F - BAR domain of Cdc15 and the I - BAR domain of Ivy1p [ 51 – 53 ] . The PACSIN2 F - BAR domain was observed forming ﬁ laments in vitro without liposomes ( Fig . 2 ) . The formation of these ﬁ laments suggests that the BAR domain ﬁ rst forms polymers on the membrane , fol - lowed by polymer sheet or spiral formation , and ﬁ nally fol - lowed by membrane bending to form the spirals on the surface of the tubules [ 34 ] ( Fig . 3a ) . The spirals are loosely packed upon initial formation , and gradually become com - pacted , as demonstrated in cryo - electron microscopy studies [ 33 – 35 , 48 ] . Alternatively , the membrane may tubulate spontaneously with thermal ﬂ uctuation , and thus the BAR domain can sense a curved membrane and then bind to it , thereby decreasing the ﬂ uctuation and leading to the forma - tion of tubular membrane structures ( Fig . 3b ) . Such ﬁ laments of the BAR domain have not been observed in cells , due to lack of appropriate examination methods . Detailed kinetics of such ﬁ lament formation in vitro and in cells are also unclear . To address this problem , computational approaches have been applied . However , due to computa - tional limitations , all - atom molecular dynamic simulations could not be adapted for such analyses . Therefore , coarse - grained approaches have been utilized to examine how BAR domains assemble into ﬁ laments and then into sheets on ﬂ at membranes , which , in turn , then bend the membrane [ 54 – 56 ] . In coarse - grained simulations , BAR domain aligned on the membrane as a sheet , and then bent the membrane before wrapping it into tubules [ 45 – 47 ] . However , it is very hard to observe this process in live , because microscopic observation cannot distinguish polymeric status of BAR domain as described below . Possible regulation of BAR protein assembly through protein binding , lipid binding or mechanical properties of the membrane such as tension BAR domains themselves are able to assemble into polymers and then spirals on the surface of a membrane in vitro , a process apparently dependent on the concentration of the BAR protein . Then , BAR proteins bend the membrane , for which several mechanisms that facilitate the accumulation of BAR proteins to a speci ﬁ c location have been proposed , analo - gous to the mechanism of intracellular signaling cascades . Small GTPases are possible regulators of BAR proteins , since some BAR proteins have small GTPase binding sites such as the CRIB motif ( IRSp53 ) [ 57 , 58 ] and the HR domain ( FBP17 , Toca - 1 and CIP4 ) [ 59 , 60 ] . The Arfaptin BAR domain itself binds to small GTPase Rac and Arf [ 61 ] . These small GTPases are considered to regulate BAR proteins by modifying the intramolecular interactions or multimerization on the membrane . However , most BAR proteins lack the small GTPase binding sites , and therefore it remains unclear how BAR protein assembly is regulated by small GTPases . Because BAR domains bind to the membrane through elec - trostatic interactions between the positively charged protein surface and negatively charged lipids , such as phosphatidyl - serine and phosphoinositides , the accumulation or localized production of phosphoinositides , such as PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , should presumably regulate BAR domain assembly [ 25 , 62 , 63 ] , as well as the activity of N - WASP downstream of the BAR proteins [ 64 ] . However , since the plasma membrane is composed of more phosphatidylserine than phosphoinosi - tides , the contribution of phosphoinositides in membranes Fig . 2 .

Moreover , phos - phorylation of the BAR protein in the control of assembly has also been proposed whereby the introduction of negative charges by phosphorylation weakens electrostatic interactions [ 65 – 71 ] . However , no common phosphorylation sites have been found . Furthermore , the presence of a possible inhibitory factor has been hypothesized . The F - BAR - only protein PSTPIP2 antagonizes actin polymerization in the podosome by compet - ing with FBP17 , which has the SH3 domain for association with the actin regulators , at the membrane . However , the func - tion of PSTPIP2 with other BAR proteins remains unclear [ 72 ] . The precise role of molecular interactions in the regula - tion of BAR proteins is yet to be elucidated , however , the regulation independent of molecules is also proposed . Membrane tension was recently proposed to regulate the assembly of the F - BAR protein FBP17 on the plasma mem - brane [ 73 ] . The tension apparently inhibits the formation of invaginations and thus may regulate the formation of FBP17 - localized membrane invaginations ( Fig . 3a ) . Interest - ingly , BAR domain assembly seems to be tension - dependent at least in silico , as assessed by coarse - grained simulations [ 55 ] , suggesting that the formation of plasma membrane struc - tures is also possibly tension - dependent . Interestingly , clathrin - mediated endocytosis , which is considered to be regulated by FBP17 and N - WASP , reportedly has a different dependency on the actin cytoskeleton under various membrane tensions , as the actin cytoskeleton is required for the scission of clathrin - Fig . 3 . The spiral of the BAR domain proteins on membrane tubules . Schematic representation of BAR domain protein assembly on the surface of membrane tubules . ( a ) If the BAR domain positively catalyzes tubule formation , then its regulated or stochastic assembly promotes tubule formation . In this case , the BAR domain might ﬁ rst assemble into ﬁ laments and then into spirals on the surface of the membrane . Tension is supposed to inhibit this transition to spirals or the deformation of ﬂ at membrane into invaginated membrane . ( b ) If the BAR domain behaves as a sensor for membrane curvature , then the BAR domain assembles on stochastically generated tubules . In both cases , the tension is supposed to disrupt the membrane structures , thereby releasing the BAR proteins from the membrane .

If BAR protein assembly is inhibited by membrane tension , then BAR proteins should assemble in a stochastic manner on membranes without tension . Stochastic assembly of the F - BAR protein FCHo1 / 2 at clathrin - coated pits has been pro - posed [ 75 ] . The initial trigger for the formation of clathrin - coated pits is thought to be a signal such as ubiquitination of cargo proteins , including growth factor receptors , and the sto - chastic assembly of FCHo1 / 2 has been proposed to trigger the assembly of the cargo proteins [ 76 ] . Coarse - grained simula - tions suggested that spontaneous membrane curvature pro - motes the assembly of proteins , such as viral capsid proteins [ 77 ] , and hence it is possible BAR domains assemble in a similar manner . It is interesting that membrane tension and stochastic assembly are both mechanisms that are not depend - ent on interactions with other molecules , and thus they could be novel mechanisms for protein assembly . However , it is still possible that BAR proteins work as sensors for membrane curvature of existing organelles , without catalyzing the formation of subcellular membrane structures ( Fig . 3b ) . In this case , the tension is also reported to disrupt the membrane structures , thereby releasing the BAR proteins from the membrane ( Fig . 3b ) . As discussed above , there are several possible mechanisms , although the situation is likely to be a combination of these . Membrane tension is also reportedly buffered through ﬂ at - tening of another type of plasma membrane invagination , the caveolae [ 78 ] . The F - BAR domain protein PACSIN2 is involved in caveolae formation , and localization of PACSIN2 at caveolae has been found to be negatively regulated by phos - phorylation induced by tension - activated protein kinase C via either hypo - osmolality or shear stress [ 71 , 79 ] . In this case , the tension - mediated regulation of PACSIN2 assembly at caveolae might cooperate with the phosphorylation . It is still unclear whether the phosphorylation of PACSIN2 leads to ﬂ attening or the removal of caveolae by endocytosis , because the light microscopy cannot distinguish the ﬂ attening or the removal of caveolae if both are observed by disappearance of caveolae . If the ﬂ attened caveolae are visible , then the canonical light microscopic analysis cannot detect the change in the size of caveolae , because ﬂ attened caveolae are still supposed to be smaller than 200 nm in diameter . Therefore , for such an ana - lysis , electron microscopy is the only available method . Membrane insertion of the amphipathic helix , and scission of tubules by the possible polymerization of the BAR domain Some BAR domains insert amphipathic alpha - helices or loops into the membrane . The BAR domains from amphi - physin and endophilin have an amphipathic α - helix that can be inserted into the hydrophobic portion of the membrane bilayer [ 27 , 35 ] . PACSINs have a loop on the membrane - binding surface , and the loop contributes to the membrane binding by its insertion into the membrane [ 80 , 81 ] . The I - BAR domain of missing - in - metastasis also has an amphi - pathic helix inserted into the membrane , in contrast to the I - BAR domain of IRSp53 , which is not inserted into the membrane [ 63 , 82 ] . The presence of such an insertion is sup - posed to contribute to the membrane binding . The hemi - insertion can increase the area of the hemi - layer in the mem - brane bilayer and thus deform the membrane [ 8 , 15 ] . It is interesting that the insertion can directly interact with the hydrophobic acyl chains in the membrane . Endophilin binding to the membrane was reportedly dependent on the acyl chain composition of the lipids [ 83 ] . However , details of this interaction have not been elucidated . Another important aspect of this insertion is that it appears to contribute to membrane scission [ 29 , 84 , 85 ] . Although the detailed mechanisms have not been clari ﬁ ed , high concentrations of such BAR proteins reportedly contribute to membrane scis - sion both in vitro and in vivo , presumably by cutting the tubu - lated membrane into small vesicles . Multiple insertions into the membrane by assembled BAR domains could play a key role in scission , by regulating the ﬂ uidity of the lipid molecules in the membrane . Before the discovery of scission activity of the BAR domain , scission for endocytosis was thought to be mediated by the GTPase dynamin and the actin cytoskeleton [ 14 ] . However , in some endocytic pathways , including clathrin - independent pathways , vesicles are apparently formed by cutting the plasma membrane invaginations , independently of dynamin [ 86 , 87 ] . Scission activity of BAR domains may function in such cases . Intriguingly , endophi - lin itself has been proposed to mediate endocytosis , in cooperation with dynamin , with the endophilin - dependent scission activity appearing to function in this case [ 87 ] . Possible importance of higher - order structures Besides membrane cutting and deformation , higher - order structures of the BAR domain , i . e . spirals , could be import - ant for downstream molecules and should be considered as existing in a different state than the solubilized or ‘ sol ’ state [ 88 , 89 ] . BAR proteins are not freely diffusive or are not in the ‘ sol ’ state in spirals . The assumption that proteins are free in solution is the basis of understanding the molecule – molecule interactions governed by the dissociation constant ( K d value ) [ 11 ] . Thus , BAR proteins within spirals on the surface of membrane tubules are likely to have different properties than those in the soluble form . The local concen - tration of the higher - order protein can be in the millimolar 6 Microscopy , 2016 , Vol . 0 , No . 0 a t O r t a D ogu T e kn i k U n i v e r s it y L i b r a r y ( OD T U ) on F e b r u a r y 20 , 2016 h tt p : / / j m i c r o . ox f o r d j ou r n a l s . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m range , which is ∼ 1000 times higher than the typical concen - tration of a soluble protein in cells which is in the micromo - lar range [ 88 ] . Therefore , assembly of the BAR domain into spirals can have different properties in a different phase such as the ‘ gel ’ phase . In fact , the gel – sol transition of the adopter protein Nck , which contains several SH3 domains and the SH2 domain , has been shown to drastically change the activity of the downstream proteins , such as the actin regulator N - WASP , like phase transition [ 89 ] . Since BAR proteins also have the SH3 domain , the surface of the BAR domain - decorated membrane tubules could be in a ‘ gel ’ - like state . In fact , the F - BAR domain protein CIP4 and Toca - 1 at certain concentrations had over 10 - fold increased ability in the activation of N - WASP - dependent actin polymerization in vitro in the presence , compared with the absence , of lipo - some , suggesting a phase transition - like change [ 90 ] . This phase transition - like activation of actin polymerization could be important for ﬁ lopodia formation , since the same proteins could reconstitute the ﬁ lopodia - like actin bundles in the lipid bilayer [ 91 ] . Recently , some low - complexity pro - teins involved in RNA binding and spindle apparatus assembly were reported to be controlled by such phase tran - sition [ 92 , 93 ] , suggesting that this could be a novel mechan - ism of regulation of proteins , including BAR proteins . Further studies are required to further clarify this mode of protein regulation . Limitations of microscopic techniques in the study of membrane morphology The BAR domains have a lot of unknown features in their assembly as described above . To elucidate such features , sophisticated microscopic observations are de ﬁ nitely required . Precise elucidation of the actual assembly of BAR proteins and their downstream effectors would require the tracking of each molecule within a space smaller than the diffraction limits of light . This is a dif ﬁ cult technical problem to address , despite currently available super - resolution microscopy techniques such as stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ( STORM ) and photo - activated localization microscopy ( PALM ) [ 94 , 95 ] . The problem is exacerbated , in part , by the inability to estimate and control observable proteins with high accuracy [ 96 ] . One of the lim - itations of super - resolution microscopy is such unknown ef ﬁ ciency of observation ( i . e . the percentage of molecules visible using the technique cannot be predicted ) and insuf ﬁ - cient time resolution due to the dependency on single mol - ecule localization ( i . e . only one molecule is visible within the space of diffraction limit , with a diameter of ∼ 200 nm , that means at least 100 images are required to determine the localization of 100 molecules within this space ) . Resolution with a high - density protein is dependent on the development of ef ﬁ cient protein observation methods with high temporal and spatial resolutions , in both experimental and computational settings , both of which are under exten - sive development [ 40 , 97 , 98 ] . The BAR domain assembly is apparently a phenomenon within such a scale under diffrac - tion limit , and thus it is a challenge to observe the precise localization of each BAR domain in any particular mem - brane structures . There have been some examples of super - resolution observation of BAR proteins , but none has successfully addressed the proposed spirals and oligomers of BAR proteins at the neck of clathrin - coated pits or other sites [ 99 , 100 ] . Therefore , the visualization of BAR domain polymers in cells would require further development of super - resolution microscopy techniques . Conclusion remarks The binding of speci ﬁ c BAR proteins to the cellular mem - brane suggests that these proteins could serve as markers for organelles . The shapes of cellular organelles without any distinguishing characteristics cannot be observed by electron micrography , and thus the membranes of such organelles cannot have been described . With well - characterized pro - teins such as the BAR proteins used as molecular markers , in combination with modi ﬁ ed microscopy techniques , the discovery of novel , as - yet uncharacterized organelles might become possible .
