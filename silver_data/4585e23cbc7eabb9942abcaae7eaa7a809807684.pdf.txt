Despite their potential , EVs short half - life following systemic administration hinders their therapeutic ef ﬁ cacy . EVs have been reported to bind to extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins and play an essential role in matrix mineralisation . Chitosan and collagen type I are naturally - derived pro - osteogenic biomaterials , which have been demonstrated to control EV release kinetics . Therefore , this study aimed to develop an injectable ECM - mimetic hydrogel capable of controlling the release of osteoblast - derived EVs to promote bone repair . Pure chitosan hydrogels signi ﬁ cantly enhanced compressive modulus ( 2 . 48 - fold ) and osteogenic differentiation ( 3 . 07 - fold ) , whilst reducing gelation times ( 2 . 09 - fold ) and proliferation ( 2 . 7 - fold ) compared to pure collagen gels ( p ≤ 0 . 001 ) . EV release was strongly associated with collagen concentration ( R 2 > 0 . 94 ) , where a signi ﬁ cantly increased EV release pro ﬁ le was observed from chitosan containing gels using the CD63 ELISA ( p ≤ 0 . 001 ) . Hydrogel - released EVs enhanced human bone marrow stromal cells ( hBMSCs ) proliferation ( 1 . 12 - fold ) , migration ( 2 . 55 - fold ) , and mineralisation ( 3 . 25 - fold ) compared to untreated cells ( p ≤ 0 . 001 ) . Importantly , EV - functionalised chitosan - collagen composites signi ﬁ cantly promoted hBMSCs extracellular matrix mineralisation when compared to the EV - free gels in a dose - dependent manner ( p ≤ 0 . 001 ) . Taken together , these ﬁ ndings demonstrate the development of a pro - osteogenic thermosensitive chitosan - collagen hydrogel capable of enhancing the therapeutic ef ﬁ cacy of osteoblast - derived EVs as a novel acellular tool for bone augmentation strategy .

Approximately 10 million people suffer from musculoskeletal disorders in the United Kingdom , costing the National Health Service £5 billion annually ( Chance - Larsen et al . , Edited by : Nuno M .

Alarmingly , this is expected to escalate further in the future as a result of the growing ageing population and demand for continued quality of life , exacerbating the medical , and socio - economic burden worldwide . Traditional treatments such as autogenous or allogenous bone grafts have been seen as the gold standard for many decades , however , their use is associated with limitations such as donor site morbidity , limited availability and other complications ( Betz , 2002 ; Roberts and Rosenbaum , 2012 ) . Bone graft substitutes combined with hyper - concentrated osteoinductive growth factors have been utilised clinically with positive results ( Roberts and Rosenbaum , 2012 ) . For example , bone morphogenic protein 2 ( BMP2 ) loaded collagen scaffolds ( INFUSE ® ) has been widely used by orthopaedic surgeons to promote fracture repair ( Gresham et al . , 2021 ) . However , these supraphysiological doses of BMP2 can result in severe complications including heterotopic ossi ﬁ cation , hematoma , in ﬂ ammation , and myelopathy that may require further surgical interventions ( Epstein , 2013 ; Hustedt and Blizzard , 2014 ; James et al . , 2016 ) . Hence , there is a tremendous need for new approaches to rapidly regenerate bone , overcoming the limitations of current clinical strategies ( Giannoudis et al . , 2013 ) . Tissue engineering approaches for bone regeneration have been subject to extensive research in recent decades , with methods combining the use of cells with osteoinductive biomaterials as a promising strategy to promote osteogenesis . Cell - based therapies commonly utilise mesenchymal stromal cells ( MSCs ) due to their ease of procurement from numerous tissues and their multipotency ( Marolt Presen et al . , 2019 ; Man et al . , 2021a ) . The use of these treatments are attractive as they attempt to mimic the body ’ s endogenous repair mechanisms , with some promising results observed ( Tatara and Mikos , 2016 ) . The direct transplantation of MSC - based therapies , however are associated with several complications including their uncontrolled differentiation , immunological rejection , their inherent heterogeneity , functional tissue engraftment , and neoplasm formation ( Amariglio et al . , 2009 ; Herberts et al . , 2011 ) . Moreover , the translation of cell - based therapies to the clinical setting is hindered by signi ﬁ cant hurdles associated with intensive cost , government regulations , and ethical issues ( Heathman et al . , 2015 ) . Consequently , there is great precedence to develop new treatments that retain the therapeutic effects of cell - based therapies . In recent years , growing evidence has shown that bioactive factors secreted from cells play a critical role in the activation of stem / progenitor cell - mediated tissue repair ( Kim et al . , 2010 ; Li et al . , 2016 ) . Extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) are considered one of the most important secretory products of cells , involved in numerous trophic , and immunomodulatory processes . EVs are cell - secreted lipid nanoparticles that contain a diverse biological cargo including nucleic acids , proteins , and bioactive molecules ( Raposo and Stoorvogel , 2013 ; Börger et al . , 2017 ; Man et al . , 2020 ) . These nano - sized vesicles are thought to be heavily involved in intercellular communications , regulating tissue homeostasis and development ( Yoon et al . , 2014 ) . The bene ﬁ cial effects once attributed to cells are now thought to be partially due to the bioactive factors delivered by EVs ( Gnecchi et al . , 2005 ; Xin et al . , 2014 ) . Extensive research has investigated the use of EV - based therapeutics due to several advantageous properties when compared to cell - based treatments . For example , when compared to cells , EVs nanoscale size promotes administration , decreases vascular occlusion , and macrophage phagocytosis ( van den Boorn et al . , 2011 ; EL Andaloussi et al . , 2013 ) . Additionally , EVs possess high physiochemical stability GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT | Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www . frontiersin . org March 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 829969 2 Man et al . ECM - Mimetic Hydrogel Promotes Vesicle - Induced Mineralisation and innate biocompatibility when compared to similarly sized delivery vehicles such as arti ﬁ cial nanoparticles ( Clayton et al . , 2003 ; Man et al . , 2020 ) . These naturally - derived nanoparticles are thought to be fundamentally involved in bone development , as matrix - bound EVs are critical for endochondral ossi ﬁ cation ( Ferreira and Porter , 2018 ; Ansari et al . , 2021 ) . Moreover , EVs derived from bone cells have been found to play a role in mediating intercellular communication , regulating bone homeostasis ( Gao et al . , 2018 ; Tao and Guo , 2019 ) . Speci ﬁ cally , it has been shown that osteoblast - EVs contain RANKL , can stimulate RANKL - RANK signalling to promote osteoclast formation ( Deng et al . , 2015 ) . In addition , RANK - containing osteoclast - EVs may obstruct RANKL - containing osteoblast - EVs function , thus inhibiting osteoclast formation ( Huynh et al . , 2016 ) . Thus , harnessing these nanoparticles for regenerative medicine is an attractive acellular , but biological approach to recapitulate endogenous bone repair . Moreover , due to the limitations of current single growth factor treatments ( e . g . , BMP2 ) ( Hustedt and Blizzard , 2014 ) , the diverse biological cargo delivered by EVs presents a multitargeted strategy to stimulate tissue repair , an approach which is needed given the known synergistic role of angiogenesis , osteogenesis , innervation involved in bone regeneration ( Grosso et al . , 2017 ; Marrella et al . , 2018 ) . Previously , we reported that EVs derived from mineralising osteoblast were enriched with pro - mineralising proteins such as calcium channelling Annexins proteins , and several pro - osteogenic microRNA species ( Davies et al . , 2017 ; Man et al . , 2021b ) . Hence , there have been intensive investigations into the role EVs may play as novel acellular tools that support natural bone regeneration , overcoming the tremendous regulatory hurdles associated with the translation of cell - based therapies ( Sensebé et al . , 2013 ; Heathman et al . , 2015 ) . Several studies have demonstrated the osteoinductive capacity of EVs derived from stem / progenitor cells as an acellular approach to bone tissue engineering ( BTE ) ( Davies et al . , 2017 ; Yan et al . , 2020 ; Man et al . , 2021b ; Man et al . , 2021c ) . Although the potential of these nanoparticles have been shown , as with the administration of any bioactive molecules , controlling the half - life of EVs at the defect site is essential to therapeutic ef ﬁ cacy ( Man et al . , 2020 ) . Previous studies have reported the rapid clearance of systemically administrated EVs , which accumulate in the liver and lungs and are sequestered by circulating macrophages in the reticuloendothelial systems and cleared from the body ( Imai et al . , 2015 ) . Moreover , the direct FIGURE 1 | Experimental outline detailing the development of a chitosan - collagen composite hydrogel for promoting EV therapeutic ef ﬁ cacy for site speci ﬁ c bone regeneration . 1 ) Thein ﬂ uenceofchitosan - collagenhydrogelcontentonmaterialpropertiesandosteogenicdifferentiation . 2 ) EVisolation , characterisation , andhydrogel - EV release kinetics . 3 ) The biological ef ﬁ cacy of hydrogel - released EVs on hBMSCs behaviour . 4 ) The in ﬂ uence of EV - functionalised hydrogel on encapsulated hBMSCs mineralisation .

ECM - Mimetic Hydrogel Promotes Vesicle - Induced Mineralisation administration of EVs into the site of injury has only transient effects as they are rapidly cleared from the defect site , often requiring subsequent injections to be clinically effective ( Zhang et al . , 2016 ) . As such , there are growing investigations exploring the delivery of EVs within biomaterials to promote their bioavailability in vivo , ultimately improving their therapeutic ef ﬁ cacy ( Brennan et al . , 2020 ) . The use of injectable polymeric biomaterials presents an attractive platform to tailor the release of these naturally - derived nanoparticles for different clinical requirements , in addition to allowing for minimally invasive delivery ( Kearney and Mooney , 2013 ) . For example , stem cell - derived EVs substantially improved cardiac function in mice following myocardial infarction when delivered in a gelatin methacryloyl ( GelMA ) hydrogel when compared to saline solution ( Tang et al . , 2021 ) . Although several reports have demonstrated the sustained release kinetics of EVs from biomaterial systems ( Mol et al . , 2019 ; Nikravesh et al . , 2019 ) , there have been limited studies investigating the delivery of these nanoparticles within pro - osteoinductive materials to facilitate EV - induced bone formation . Hence , there is a current unmet clinical need to locally deliver these naturally - derived nanoparticles within biomaterials systems that control their release kinetics in vivo , in addition to promoting EV - induced bone formation . Numerous natural and synthetic polymeric materials have been shown to exhibit pro - osteoinductive properties ( Bai et al . , 2018 ; Zhang et al . , 2020 ) . It has been reported that secreted EVs are sequestered by extracellular matrix ( ECM ) components ( Huang et al . , 2016 ; Man et al . , 2020 ) , therefore , the delivery of these nanoparticles within an ECM - mimetic biomaterial could provide a template for EV - induced mineralisation . Chitosan , a natural polysaccharide derived from deacetylated chitin , a structural component of crustacean exoskeletons ( Saravanan et al . , 2019 ) , has been used for several applications due to its biocompatibility , antibacterial activity and low immunogenicity ( Chung et al . , 2012 ; Ahmadi et al . , 2015 ) . The polysaccharide unit of chitosan structurally resembles glycosaminoglycans ( GAGs ) , a major component of the bone matrix ( Khor and Lim , 2003 ) . The cationic nature of chitosan is attributed to its biological properties such as antimicrobial activity , hemostasis and osteoconduction ( Peschel et al . , 2012 ) . Additionally , the existence of hydroxyl and amino groups has been extensively exploited for the delivery of various growth factors or drugs ( Zhang et al . , 2010 ; Saravanan et al . , 2019 ) . Several studies have reported the enhanced therapeutic administration of EVs within thermosensitive chitosan hydrogels for numerous applications ( Li et al . , 2018 ; Shen et al . , 2020 ; Zhao et al . , 2021 ) , harnessing the electrostatic interactions between cationic chitosan and the anionic EVs . To induced thermo - gelation within chitosan , the addition of β - glycerophosphate ( β - GP ) has commonly be employed to facilitate its sol - gel transition at physiological temperatures ( Kong et al . , 2018 ; Rahmanian - Devin et al . , 2021 ) . Moreover , it has been previously reported that EVs require a phosphate - rich environment to stimulate hBMSCs mineralisation ( Davies et al . , 2017 ) . In BTE , chitosan has been combined with other materials to increase its osteoconductivity and mechanical strength ( Di Martino et al . , 2005 ) . Type I collagen is the fundamental protein found in the bone matrix and has been widely utilised as a biomaterial since it supports cell adhesion , proliferation , and differentiation ( Yang et al . , 2004 ; Glowacki and Mizuno , 2008 ) . Moreover , the integrin - mediated adhesion to collagen has been shown to enhance stem cell osteogenic differentiation ( Salasznyk et al . , 2004 ; Kundu and Putnam , 2006 ) . This interaction has also been used to immobilise EVs within collagen hydrogels for different clinical applications ( Buzás et al . , 2018 ; Ramírez et al . , 2020 ) . Additionally , it has been reported that the calcium binding Annexin proteins found on the surface of mineralising vesicles are essential in mediating proteoliposome attachment to collagen ﬁ brils ( Kirsch et al . , 2000 ; Davies et al . , 2017 ) . Hence , an ECM - mimetic composite hydrogel consisting of chitosan and type I collagen could control EV release kinetics and provide an osteoinductive delivery system to promote the therapeutic ef ﬁ cacy for EVs for bone repair . Therefore , in this present study , we developed an injectable thermo - responsive chitosan - collagen composite hydrogel with sustained EV release kinetics to promote bone formation . Initially , the in ﬂ uence of augmenting chitosan - collagen content on the hydrogel ’ s gelation time , mechanical strength and osteoinduction was investigated ( Figure 1 ) . EVs were isolated from mineralising osteoblasts and their release kinetics from these composite gels were analysed via a CD63 ELISA . The biological ef ﬁ cacy of hydrogel - released EVs on human bone marrow stromal cells ( hBMSCs ) proliferation and osteogenic differentiation was investigated . Finally , the effects of EV - functionalised hydrogels on encapsulated hBMSCs mineralisation was assessed . 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2 . 1 Preparation of Chitosan - Collagen Hydrogels Rat tail collagen type I ( Corning , United Kingdom ) was diluted in 0 . 02 M acetic acid to obtain a 4 mg / ml concentration . Medium molecular weight chitosan ( Sigma - Aldrich , United Kingdom ) was dissolved in 0 . 1 M acetic acid to obtain a 2 wt % chitosan stock solution . These two solutions were mixed at various chitosan / collagen ratios of 100 / 0 , 65 / 35 , 25 / 75 , or 0 / 100 wt % . Pre - cooled 58 wt % β - GP ( Sigma - Aldrich , United Kingdom ) solution was added to the above chitosan / collagen solutions to obtain a ﬁ nal β - GP concentration of 8 % . All procedures were conducted on ice to maintain a liquid state before initiating gelation at 37 ° C . Gelation was determined by the mobility of chitosan - collagen solutions after inverting a test tube and the transition from clear to opaque transparency . The pH of the hydrogels was recorded before and after gelation . 2 . 2 Mechanical Testing The Young ’ s modulus of the composite gels was assessed via cyclic testing using the Instron 5542 mechanical tester ( Instron , United States ) . Cylindrical hydrogels ( Ø8 mm × 2 mm ) were prepared as previously described and incubated in Phosphate buffered saline ( PBS , Lonza , United Kingdom ) for 4 h prior to testing . Compression testing was performed at a rate of 1 mm / Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www . frontiersin . org March 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 829969 4 Man et al . ECM - Mimetic Hydrogel Promotes Vesicle - Induced Mineralisation min to a maximum strain of 60 % of the original height by performing 8 cycles of loading / unloading . The load ( N ) and compressive strain ( mm ) was assessed using the Bluehill 3 software . The Young ’ s modulus was calculated from the slope of the linear region of the stress ( kPa ) / strain ( mm / mm ) curves from the 8th cycle . Samples were tested in triplicate for each condition . 2 . 3 Cell Culture and Reagents MC3T3 pre - osteoblasts were acquired from American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC , United Kingdom ) and hBMSCs were purchased from Lonza ( Lonza , United Kingdom ) . Cells were cultured in basal media consisting of minimal essential medium ( α - MEM ; Sigma - Aldrich , United Kingdom ) supplemented with 10 % foetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , 1 % penicillin / streptomycin ( Sigma - Aldrich , United Kingdom ) , and L - glutamine ( Sigma - Aldrich , United Kingdom ) . hBMSCs were used at passage 4 . Osteogenic medium was comprised of basal media supplemented with 50 μ g / ml L - ascorbic acid ( Sigma - Aldrich , United Kingdom ) and 10 mM β - GP ( Sigma - Aldrich , United Kingdom ) . The medium used for EV isolation and the culture of EV - functionalised hydrogels was depleted of FBS - derived EVs via ultracentrifugation at 120 , 000 g for 16 h prior to use . 2 . 4 The Biological Ef ﬁ cacy of Chitosan - Collagen Composite Hydrogel The in ﬂ uence of hydrogel composition on proliferation was assessed via quanti ﬁ cation of DNA content . Brie ﬂ y , MC3T3s were mixed at low density ( 5 × 10 5 cell / ml ) in the hydrogel prior to gelation . Following sol - gel transition , cell - laden hydrogels were cultured in basal medium for 2 weeks with media changes every 3 days . The cellular morphology was assessed at day 3 by incubated cell - laden hydrogels with Calcein - AM ( 1 μ g / ml in PBS , Sigma - Aldrich , United Kingdom ) and Propidium iodide ( 1 μ g / ml in PBS , Sigma - Aldrich , United Kingdom ) in the dark for 30 min . Samples were observed under an EVOS ﬂ uorescent inverted microscope ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c , United Kingdom ) . The DNA content was assessed using PicoGreen ( Life Technologies , United Kingdom ) according to the manufacturer ’ s protocol . To evaluate the hydrogel effect on osteoinduction , MC3T3s were mixed at high density ( 1 × 10 6 cell / ml ) in the hydrogel prior to gelation . Following sol - gel transition , hydrogels were incubated in basal medium for 24 h . The media was replaced with osteogenic medium and gels were cultured for 2 weeks , with media changes occurring every 3 days . 2 . 5 EV Isolation and Characterization 2 . 5 . 1 EV Isolation EVs were isolated from MC3T3s as previously reported ( Man et al . , 2021b ) . Brie ﬂ y , osteoblasts were cultured at scale in T175 ﬂ asks in osteogenic medium for 14 days . The conditioned media was collected every two days . EVs were isolated from the conditioned media by differential centrifugation : 2000 g for 20 min , 10 , 000 g for 30 min , and 120 , 000 g for 70 min to pellet EVs . The supernatant was removed , and the pellet was washed in sterile PBS and centrifuged at 120 , 000 g for 70 min and the resultant pellet was re - suspended in 500 μ L PBS . All ultracentrifugation steps were performed utilising the Sorvall WX Ultra Series Ultracentrifuge ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c , United Kingdom ) and a Fiberlite , F50L - 8×39 ﬁ xed angle rotor ( Piramoon Technologies Inc . , United States ) . 2 . 5 . 2 Particle Size and Concentration Analysis Nanoparticle tracking analysis was performed on isolated EVs to determine particle concentration using a ZetaView ® instrument ( Particle Metrix , Germany ) . EV samples were diluted at 1 : 100 in PBS and injected into the ZetaView ® , where 4 × 40 s videos were obtained of particles in motion . Particle size and concentration were determined with the ZetaView ® software . Dynamic Light Scattering ( DLS ) ( Zetasizer Nano ZS , Malvern Instruments , United Kingdom ) was used to analyse the size distribution of EVs before and after incorporation within the different hydrogels . 2 . 5 . 3 Transmission Electron Microscopy The morphology of isolated EVs was conducted via a JEOL JEM1400 transmission electron microscope ( TEM ) coupled with an AMT XR80 digital acquisition system . Samples were physiosorbed to 200 mesh carbon - coated copper formvar grids ( Agar Scienti ﬁ c , United Kingdom ) and negatively stained with 1 % uranyl acetate . 2 . 5 . 4 EV Marker Analysis The presence of tetraspanin markers on the surface of EVs was assessed using the ExoView ™ Tetraspanin Kit ( NanoView Biosciences , United States ) according to the manufacturers ’ protocol and as previously described ( Gupta et al . , 2020 ; Luo et al . , 2021 ) . Brie ﬂ y , 35 µL of EV suspension ( 1 : 1 , 000 dilution in Incubation Solution ) was incubated on the ExoView ™ chip for 16 h . The chip was washed with Incubation Solution for 3 min , three times using Wash Solution and then with deionized water . The chip was then dried and analysed using the ExoView R100 ( NanoView Biosciences , United States ) with the nScan software ( version 2 . 8 . 10 ) . Using single particle interferometric re ﬂ ectance imaging sensing ( SP - IRIS ) , CD9 and / or CD81 tetraspanin - positive nanoparticles were detected and counted spot by spot as they were immuno - captured on the chip . Rat IgG spots were used as an isotype control . The data were analysed using the NanoViewer software ( version 2 . 8 . 10 ) with sizing thresholds set to 50 – 200 nm diameter . 2 . 6 EV Release Kinetics From Hydrogels The in vitro release kinetics of EVs within the chitosan - collagen hydrogels was assessed as previously reported ( Nikravesh et al . , 2019 ) . Brie ﬂ y , EVs were introduced into the different hydrogel formulations at the concentration of 100 µg / ml of EV protein prior to gelation . EV - functionalised gels were then incubated in sterile PBS at 37 ° C . At day 1 , 3 , 5 , and 7 , the receiving medium was collected , and replaced by an equal volume of fresh PBS . Previous studies have shown that EVs derived from mineralising osteoblasts were CD63 positive and as such we selected this marker for the release study ( Man et al . , 2021b ; Man et al . , Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www . frontiersin . org March 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 829969 5 Man et al . ECM - Mimetic Hydrogel Promotes Vesicle - Induced Mineralisation 2022 ) . The EV concentration in the collected medium was evaluated using the CD63 ExoELISA - ULTRA complete kit ( System Biosciences , United States ) following the manufacturer ’ s protocol . Percentage of EVs released was calculated from the initial quantity of EVs added prior to gelation . 2 . 7 The Impact of Hydrogel - Released EVs on hBMSCs Proliferation , Migration , and Mineralisation 2 . 7 . 1 EV Cell Uptake EVs were labelled using Cell Mask ™ Deep Red Plasma Membrane Stain , 1 : 1 , 000 in PBS ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c , United Kingdom ) , and incubated for 10 min . Labelled EVs were washed twice with PBS via ultracentrifugation at 120 , 000 g for 70 min , then incorporated within the 100 / 0 hydrogel before gelation . hBMSCs were seeded at 3 × 10 3 cells / cm 2 in a 48 well plate for 24 h , then media was replaced with fresh basal medium and transwell inserts ( 0 . 4 µm pore size , Greiner Bio - One , United Kingdom ) containing Cell Mask - labelled EVs encapsulated within the hydrogel . Cells cultured with EV - free hydrogels were used as the control . After 24 h , cells were ﬁ xed with 10 % ( v / v ) neutral buffered formalin ( NBF , Cellpath , United Kingdom ) , stained with Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin , 1 : 20 ( Cell Signalling Technology , United Kingdom ) , and mounted with Prolong ™ Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c , United Kingdom ) to label the actin cytoskeleton and nuclei , respectively . Samples were imaged with an EVOS ﬂ uorescent inverted microscope ( M5000 , Thermo Scienti ﬁ c , United Kingdom ) . 2 . 7 . 2 Proliferation hBMSCs were plated at low density ( 1 × 10 4 cells / cm 2 ) in basal medium within a 48 well plate . After 24 h , media was replaced with fresh basal medium and transwell inserts ( 0 . 4 µm pore size , Greiner Bio - One , United Kingdom ) , containing EV - functionalised hydrogels , were placed into each well . Media was replaced every 3 days . DNA content was assessed using the PicoGreen ( Life Technologies , United Kingdom ) according to the manufacturer ’ s protocol .

Brie ﬂ y , cells at a density of 30 × 10 3 cells / cm 2 in a 48 well plate were plated and allowed to adhere for 24 h . A scratch was applied with a 200 µL pipette tip and the width was measured as the baseline .

Brie ﬂ y , hBMSCs ( 5 × 10 5 cell / ml ) were mixed with the EV - functionalised hydrogel ( 0 , 50 , or 100 µg / ml of EV protein ) prior to gelation . Following sol - gel transition , hydrogels were culture in basal medium . At day 7 , cell - laden hydrogels were incubated with Calcein - AM ( 1 μ g / ml in PBS , Sigma - Aldrich , United Kingdom ) , and Propidium iodide ( 1 μ g / ml in PBS , Sigma - Aldrich , United Kingdom ) in the dark for 30 min . Samples were observed under an EVOS ﬂ uorescent inverted microscope ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c , United Kingdom ) . The proliferation of cell - laden EV - hydrogels was assessed via quantifying DNA content following culture in basal medium for 7 days . The capacity of EV - functionalised hydrogels to stimulate encapsulated hBMSCs ( 1 × 10 6 cell / ml ) osteogenic differentiation and mineralisation was evaluated after culture in osteogenic medium for 3 weeks . Osteogenic differentiation was assessed by quantifying alkaline phosphatase activity , collagen production and mineral deposition , detailed below .

Pure and composite hydrogels without β - GP exhibited pH values ranging from 3 . 5 to 5 , with higher pH values at greater chitosan concentrations ( p ≤ 0 . 05 – 0 . 01 ) . Following β - GP addition , pH for all groups were signi ﬁ cantly elevated to approximately pH 7 . 3 ( p ≤ 0 . 001 ) . The gelation time of hydrogels was assessed at 37 ° C . Hydrogels containing increased collagen content exhibited signi ﬁ cantly reduced gelation times when compared to chitosan - containing gels ( 16 . 9 ± 0 . 25 min ( 100 / 0 ) , 12 . 65 ± 0 . 66 ( 65 / 35 ) , 9 . 93 ± 0 . 26 ( 25 / 75 ) , and 8 . 13± 0 . 41 min ( 0 / 100 ) ( p ≤ 0 . 01 ) ( Figure 2B ) . The compressive modulus of chitosan - collagen hydrogels is shown in Figure 2C . There was a chitosan - dependent increase in hydrogel stiffness , with compressive moduli of 7 . 43 ± 0 . 25 ( 100 / 0 ) , 4 . 97 ± 0 . 49 ( 65 / 35 ) , 3 . 71 ± 0 . 46 ( 25 / 75 ) , and 2 . 99 ± 0 . 28 kPa ( 0 / 100 ) ( p ≤ 0 . 05 – 0 . 001 ) . Macroscopic images of chitosan - collagen hydrogels following sol - gel transition are shown in Figure 2D , where the gels have transitioned from a clear to opaque transparency and displayed no mobility during inversion testing . 3 . 2 The Effects of Chitosan - Collagen Hydrogel Composition on Osteogenic Differentiation . The biological effects of altering chitosan - collagen content within the composite hydrogel on cell behaviour was evaluated ( Figure 3A ) . The morphology of encapsulated cells within the different hydrogel compositions were initially assessed . At day 3 in culture , cells in the 0 / 100 gels exhibited a rounded morphology , while the encapsulated cells in the collagen - containing gels displayed a spindle - shaped morphology ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . Moreover , these images indicated cell proliferation was increased in the collagen - containing gels , which was then evaluated through DNA quanti ﬁ cation . Hydrogels containing increased collagen proportions exhibited enhanced DNA content , where the 0 / 100 gels displayed a 1 . 70 - fold ( p ≤ 0 . 01 ) , and 2 . 71 - fold ( p ≤ 0 . 001 ) signi ﬁ cant increase compared to the 65 / 35 and 100 / 0 groups respectively after 2 weeks of culture ( Figure 3B ) . The osteogenic capacity of chitosan - collagen composites was initially assessed by quantifying ALP activity . Cells cultured within hydrogels containing more chitosan displayed enhanced ALP activity , with the 100 / 0 group exhibiting a 1 . 87 ( p ≤ 0 . 001 ) and 6 . 61 - fold ( p ≤ 0 . 001 ) signi ﬁ cant increase compared to the 65 / 35 and 0 / 100 gels respectively ( Figure 3C ) . A similar pro ﬁ le on calcium deposition was observed , with the cells cultured within the 100 / 0 gels exhibiting a 1 . 32 ( p ≤ 0 . 001 ) and 3 . 07 - fold ( p ≤ 0 . 001 ) enhancement in calcium content when compared to the 65 / 35 and 0 / 100 groups ( Figures 3D , E ) . An increased density of mineral - like nodules ( black staining ) were observed in the gels containing increased chitosan . 3 . 3 Characterisation of Isolated EVs and Hydrogel Release Kinetics EV were isolated from mineralising osteoblast conditioned media over a 2 - week period via differential centrifugation . Osteoblast - derived EVs exhibited a typical size and spherical morphology through TEM imaging ( Figure 4A ) . NTA analysis of isolated EVs displayed an average diameter of 131 . 3 ± 11 . 4 nm ( Figure 4B ) . The detection of EV tetraspanin markers was performed using the Exoview platform . The obtained data con ﬁ rmed the presence of CD9 and CD81 - positive nanosized particles immune - captured on anti - CD81 and CD9 antibodies ( Figure 4C ) .

ECM - Mimetic Hydrogel Promotes Vesicle - Induced Mineralisation kinetics from these composite hydrogels were investigated using the CD63 ELISA ( Figure 4D ) . The release of EVs from these hydrogel formulations was dependant on chitosan / collagen ratios , with an increased quantity of CD63 positive particles released from gels containing a greater proportion of chitosan . There was a high average correlation between the release of EVs and the proportion of collagen within the hydrogel ( R 2 > 0 . 94 ; Supplementary Figure S2 ) . The pure chitosan formulations ( 100 / 0 ) released a signi ﬁ cantly enhanced quantity of CD63 positive particles when compared to the hydrogels containing collagen ( 65 / 35 and 0 / 100 ) at day 1 , 3 , 5 , and 7 ( p ≤ 0 . 001 ) . At day 1 , 3 . 78 ± 0 . 76 % ( 100 / 0 ) , 2 . 68 ± 0 . 09 % ( 65 / 35 ) , and 0 . 6 ± 0 . 61 % of CD63 positive EVs were released . At day 7 , the quantity of CD63 positive EVs released from the gels increased to 18 . 91 ± 0 . 77 % ( 100 / 0 ) , 8 . 98 ± 0 . 66 % ( 65 / 35 ) , and 1 . 13 ± 0 . 18 % ( 0 / 100 ) . The size distribution of EVs before and after hydrogel incorporation did not signi ﬁ cantly shift over time between the different hydrogel groups ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) . 3 . 4 Hydrogel - Released EVs Enhance hBMSC Proliferation and Osteogenic Differentiation The therapeutic ef ﬁ cacy of hydrogel - released EVs on hBMSCs behaviour was evaluated using the transwell assay . We observed the successful internalisation of hydrogel - released EVs by hBMSCs , with the labelled vesicles primarily located within the cytoplasm of the cell ( Figure 5A ) . There was a signi ﬁ cant increase in the proliferation of hBMSCs in all EV - functionalised hydrogel groups when compared to the untreated control ( p ≤ 0 . 001 ) ( Figure 5B ) . Notably , there was a chitosan - dependent increased in hBMSCs proliferation at day 3 and 7 . Cells cultured with the 100 / 0 group exhibited a signi ﬁ cantly enhanced DNA content when compared to the 0 / 100 ( 1 . 07 - fold , p ≤ 0 . 01 ) and untreated control ( 1 . 10 - fold , p ≤ 0 . 001 ) at day 3 . At day 7 , a similar trend was observed , where the 100 / 0 group showed a signi ﬁ cantly enhanced hBMSCs DNA content compared to the cells cultured with the 65 / 35 ( 1 . 06 - fold , p ≤ 0 . 01 ) and 0 / 100 ( 1 . 06 - fold , p ≤ 0 . 01 ) and untreated control ( 1 . 12 - fold , p ≤ 0 . 001 ) . The EV functionalised hydrogels signi ﬁ cantly promoted hBMSCs migration when compared to the untreated control ( > 1 . 48 - fold , p ≤ 0 . 01 – 0 . 001 ) ( Figure 5C ) ( Supplementary Figure S4 ) . A chitosan - dependent increase in migration was observed , where the 100 / 0 group exhibited a 1 . 25 ( p ≤ 0 . 01 ) and 1 . 72 - fold ( p ≤ 0 . 001 ) enhancement in hBMSCs migration compared to 65 / 35 and 0 / 100 , respectively . The effects of hydrogel - released EVs on hBMSCs osteogenic differentiation was evaluated by analysing collagen production and calcium deposition during osteogenic differentiation . We observed a signi ﬁ cant increase in osteogenic differentiation in all EV - functionalised hydrogel groups when compared to the untreated control following 2 weeks of osteoinductive culture ( p ≤ 0 . 05 – 0 . 001 ) . There was a chitosan - dependent enhancement in hBMSCs collagen production , with the 100 / 0 group exhibited a 1 . 02 ( p > 0 . 05 ) , 1 . 05 ( p ≤ 0 . 05 ) , and 1 . 08 - fold ( p ≤ 0 . 01 ) greater collagen content compared to 65 / 35 , 0 / 100 and untreated control respectively ( Figures 5D , F ) . The effect on calcium deposition showed a similar pro ﬁ le , with the pure chitosan groups exhibiting a signi ﬁ cant 1 . 19 , 1 . 26 , and 3 . 25 - fold increase in hBMSCs calcium accumulation compared to the 65 / 35 , 0 / 100 , and untreated group respectively ( p ≤ 0 . 001 ) ( Figures 5E , F ) . 3 . 5 EV - Functionalised Chitosan - Collagen Composite Hydrogel Promoted hBMSC Osteogenic Differentiation and Mineralisation The 65 / 35 composite was utilised as it provides a suitable balance between compressive modulus , osteogenic properties and EV release kinetics . Hydrogels were functionalised with 0 , 50 , or 100 ug / ml of EV protein ( Figure 6A ) , and the viability of hBMSCs was assessed with live / dead staining and DNA quanti ﬁ cation . At day 7 , live / dead imaging showed an EV dose - dependent increase in the density of viable cells when compared to the untreated control ( Figure 6B ) . There was a signi ﬁ cant enhancement in hBMSC proliferation in an EV dose - dependent manner at day 3 ( untreated vs . EV - 100 , p ≤ 0 . 01 ) and 7 ( EV - 50 vs . EV - 100 , p ≤ 0 . 01 ) ( Figure 6C ) . The in ﬂ uence of EV - functionalised hydrogels on the mineralisation of encapsulated hBMSCs was assessed following 21 days osteogenic culture . Quanti ﬁ cation of ALP activity was initially conducted to evaluate the osteoinductive capacity of EV - hydrogels . An EV dose - dependent increase in ALP activity was observed from the hBMSCs at day 7 ( untreated vs . EV - 100 , p ≤ 0 . 05 ) and day 14 ( untreated vs . EV - 50 , p ≤ 0 . 01 ) in osteogenic culture ( Figure 6D ) , with the EV - 100 group exhibiting a non - signi ﬁ cant increase in ALP compared to the EV - 50 gels at both time points ( p > 0 . 05 ) . Extracellular matrix production and mineralisation were evaluated via quantifying collagen production and calcium deposition respectively . Both EV - 50 and EV - 100 groups exhibited a signi ﬁ cant increase in collagen production when compared to the untreated control ( 1 . 68 and 2 . 47 - fold , respectively ) ( p ≤ 0 . 001 ) , with the EV - 100 group eliciting a 1 . 46 - fold enhancement compared to the EV - 50 gel ( p ≤ 0 . 001 ) ( Figure 6E ) . A similar trend was observed for calcium deposition , with the EV - functionalised gels displaying signi ﬁ cantly enhanced calcium content compared to the untreated control . The EV - 50 and EV - 100 gels exhibited a 1 . 28 - fold ( p ≤ 0 . 05 ) and 2 . 03 - fold ( p ≤ 0 . 001 ) increased in calcium deposition when compared to the untreated control , with the EV - 100 gel displaying a signi ﬁ cantly greater degree of calcium deposition and mineral - like nodules when compared to the EV - 50 group ( 1 . 58 - fold ) ( p ≤ 0 . 01 ) ( Figures 6F , G ) . 4 DISCUSSION Harnessing EVs as an acellular tool for bone augmentation strategies has gained considerable interest in recent years ( Marolt Presen et al . , 2019 ; Man et al . , 2021b ) . For example , Davies et al . demonstrated that osteoblast - derived EVs enhanced hBMSCs mineralisation when compared to the use of the clinically relevant growth factor BMP2 ( Davies et al . , 2017 ) . Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www . frontiersin . org March 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 829969 12 Man et al . ECM - Mimetic Hydrogel Promotes Vesicle - Induced Mineralisation Due to the rapid clearance of systemically administered vesicles from the body ( Murphy et al . , 2019 ; Elsharkasy et al . , 2020 ) , the logical next step to advance EV - based therapies to the clinical setting , would be the development of an osteoinductive delivery system to enhance EVs bioavailability and bioactivity to promote bone repair . As cell - derived factors such as EVs are known to interact with ECM components during mineralisation , the delivery of vesicles within an ECM - mimetic biomaterial could recapitulate the EV function during bone formation . Therefore , in this study , we investigated the development of a pro - osteogenic chitosan - collagen composite hydrogel to control EV release kinetics and synergistically promote EV - induced hBMSCs osteogenesis . In recent years , a growing number of studies have investigated combining EVs with hydrogel systems to promote their release kinetics for different therapeutic applications ( Riau et al . , 2019 ; Man et al . , 2020 ) . For instance , Nikravesh et al . reported the development of a tailorable alginate - based EV release system , by controlling the physical structuring of the hydrogel during the sol - gel transition ( Nikravesh et al . , 2019 ) . Although the delivery of these nanoparticles from hydrogels has produced promising results , the administered biomaterial must also provide appropriate physical and biological properties to support the defect site and promote de novo bone formation respectively . As such , we investigated the in ﬂ uence of altering chitosan - collagen content on the general material properties of the hydrogel . Our ﬁ ndings showed that the chitosan - collagen formulations exhibited gelation times ranging from 5 to 15 min at 37 ° C , a clinically reasonable handling time for orthopaedic surgeries ( Costa , 2017 ) . Moreover , increasing chitosan content within the hydrogel , signi ﬁ cantly enhanced the compressive modulus of the hydrogel , consistent with studies in the literature ( Chicatun et al . , 2013 ; McBane et al . , 2013 ) . It has been reported that materials which exhibit increased stiffness , promote osteogenesis through enhanced mechanotransductive stimulation ( Ghasemi - Mobarakeh et al . , 2015 ; Sun et al . , 2018 ) , likely impacting the osteoinductive capacity of these gels . Together these ﬁ ndings demonstrate the composite hydrogels exhibit suitable in situ gelation times and mechanical properties facilitating its minimally invasive administration to the defect site . Although several reports have demonstrated the release kinetics of EVs over multiple days from biomaterial systems ( Mardpour et al . , 2019 ; Man et al . , 2020 ) , there have been limited investigations into the role of the delivery device on EV - induced biological activity . Chitosan and type I collagen were selected due to their biocompatible nature and their osteoinductive properties ( Hesse et al . , 2010 ; Liu et al . , 2020 ) . As such , we investigated the role of altering chitosan - collagen content within the composite hydrogel to stimulate osteogenic differentiation without EVs . Our ﬁ ndings showed that hydrogels containing increased chitosan content promoted osteogenic differentiation , while gels with greater collagen proportions enhanced proliferation . This distinct effect on cellular proliferation and osteogenic differentiation has been similarly observed in the literature ( Wang and Stegemann , 2010 ; Dang et al . , 2017 ) , likely due to the respective in ﬂ uence of each biomaterial on the composite microstructure . It has been reported that the introduction of collagen to chitosan hydrogel increases the porosity of the hydrogel ( Fernandes et al . , 2011 ) . Therefore , cells within collagen containing hydrogels will likely exhibit increased proliferation due to enhanced porosity , consistent with our ﬁ ndings . Moreover , the increased compressive modulus of chitosan containing hydrogels is expected to have a positive in ﬂ uence on osteogenesis due to eliciting increased mechanical stimulation ( Ghasemi - Mobarakeh et al . , 2015 ; Sun et al . , 2018 ) . As EVs are essentially ﬁ ngerprints of their parental cells ( Kobayashi et al . , 2015 ) , the chitosan and collagen substrates may differentially in ﬂ uence the osteoinductive ef ﬁ cacy of hydrogel - encapsulated cell secreted EVs . We previously demonstrated that 3D printed titanium scaffolds exhibiting a triangular pore conformation signi ﬁ cantly promoted osteoblast differentiation when compared to square pore scaffolds ( Man et al . , 2021c ) . Importantly , the EVs derived from these triangular pore scaffolds signi ﬁ cantly enhanced the mineralisation of hBMSCs when compared to osteoblast - derived EVs from square pore scaffolds . As chitosan containing hydrogels promoted mineralisation to a greater degree compared to collagen - containing gels in this study , it is likely the chitosan - laden cells secreted EVs promoted mineralisation within the hydrogel in an autocrine / paracrine manner , although this would require further investigation . Therefore , the distinct biological effects presented by chitosan or collagen within the hydrogel provides tunability depending on the clinical application . Due to issues associated with the scalable / reproducible manufacture of EVs and their rapid clearance in vivo ( Gimona et al . , 2017 ) , this further emphasises the importance of enhancing their bioavailability . There are numerous strategies to tether EVs to biomaterials , which have been extensively reviewed in the literature ( Brennan et al . , 2020 ; Man et al . , 2020 ) . In addition to selecting pro - osteoinductive materials , chitosan , and collagen were utilised due to their capacity to immobilise EVs via different mechanisms . Chitosan is a cationic polymer , which enables the formation of complexes with anionic molecules such as on the surface of EVs . Kumar et al . harnessed the electrostatic interactions of positively charged chitosan with the negative - charged membranes of vesicles to develop a simple and robust EV isolation method from a variety of bio ﬂ uids ( Kumar et al . , 2021 ) . Moreover , the amino and hydroxyl groups have been utilised to deliver numerous drugs and growth factors ( Zhang et al . , 2010 ) . Collagen hydrogels have been reported to immobilise EVs via integrin - mediated interactions ( Buzás et al . , 2018 ) . For example , Altei et al . demonstrated the integral role of EV - associated integrins with binding to collagen . Their ﬁ ndings showed that the introduction of a disintegrin inhibitor ( Dis B a - 01 ) inhibited the adhesion of EV - derived from MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cell on collagen coated tissue culture plastic ( Altei et al . , 2020 ) . Hao et al . further demonstrated the importance of integrins in binding EVs to matrix proteins . Their ﬁ ndings showed that functionalising an integrin α 4 β 1 ligand , LLP 2 A to a material surface enhanced MSC - derived EVs binding and improved vascularisation ( Hao et al . , 2020 ) . Furthermore , calcium channelling Annexin proteins have Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www . frontiersin . org March 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 829969 13 Man et al . ECM - Mimetic Hydrogel Promotes Vesicle - Induced Mineralisation been reported to play a pivotal role in matrix - mineralisation through collagen binding ( von der Mark and Mollenhauer , 1997 ) . Several studies have reported Annexin proteins are upregulated in mineralising EVs ( Eichholz et al . , 2020 ; Man et al . , 2021b ) , with these proteins shown to be critical for the binding of proteoliposomes to collagen ﬁ brils ( Kirsch et al . , 2000 ) . Thus , the chitosan - collagen composite could provide a multi - faceted mechanism of immobilising EVs to facilitate their controlled release . To investigate EV discharge from these biomaterials , different chitosan - collagen formulations were tested in regard to their EV release kinetics over 7 days . Our ﬁ ndings showed that an increased proportion of chitosan within the composite enhanced the release rate of EVs from the hydrogel system . This may be due to the differential EV af ﬁ nity and binding to ECM proteins . Studies have shown that the addition of β - GP to chitosan reduces the cationic nature of the hydrogel , possibly affecting its capacity to capture EVs ( Kolawole et al . , 2019 ) . Our ﬁ nding indicates that collagen exhibited an increased ef ﬁ cacy to sequester EVs within the composite material compared to chitosan . As EVs have been demonstrated to promote cell recruitment , an important process for endogenous bone repair ( Wang et al . , 2018 ) , these results suggest the importance of incorporating chitosan in the composite to facilitate the release of these vesicles from the hydrogel . Together , these ﬁ ndings demonstrate the importance of investigating the release kinetics of EV - functionalised hydrogels , as this will signi ﬁ cantly impact the vesicles bioavailability and functionality in situ . A potential concern with the delivery of EVs within biomaterials systems , is the possibility that the released nanoparticles functionality may be altered , ultimately impacting their therapeutic ef ﬁ cacy . Moreover , in the bone context , the recruitment of endogenous cells into the defect site / implanted material is essential for successful de novo tissue formation and osseointegration ( Wang et al . , 2018 ) . As EVs have been demonstrated to stimulate cellular recruitment ( Gholami et al . , 2021 ; Zhu et al . , 2021 ) , this highlights the importance of investigating the therapeutic ef ﬁ cacy of hydrogel - released EVs from the composite material . We reported that there were no signi ﬁ cant changes in the size distribution of EVs before and after hydrogel incorporation and between the different formulations . This suggests EV incorporation into the material did not cause substantial damage to the nanoparticle integrity or cause vesicle aggregation . Regarding the functionality of released EVs , we initially investigated the in ﬂ uence of these nanoparticles on stimulating the migration and proliferation of hBMSCs , a critical process for recruitment of endogenous cells into the defect site ( Perez et al . , 2015 ) . Our ﬁ ndings showed a chitosan - dependent increased in migration and proliferation rate induced by EV treatment , consistent with the EV release kinetics observed from these gels . This indicates that the released EVs exhibited a dose - dependent effect on hBMSCs migration and proliferation , signifying the EVs retained their biological ef ﬁ cacy in stimulating cellular recruitment , consistent with ﬁ ndings in the literature ( Mol et al . , 2019 ) . In addition to the role of hydrogel - released EVs on cellular recruitment , their capacity to stimulate hBMSCs osteogenesis was investigated . EVs released from the chitosan gel signi ﬁ cantly enhanced hBMSCs mineralisation when compared to the cells cultured with the collagen - released EVs . These ﬁ ndings were consistent with the in ﬂ uence of hydrogel - released EVs on proliferation and migration , indicating the increased quantity of EVs released from chitosan - containing gels promoted hBMSCs osteogenesis . Together , these ﬁ ndings indicate that the incorporated vesicles retained their biological potency once released from the hydrogel , demonstrating the viability of this composite hydrogel as a suitable delivery vehicle for these pro - osteogenic nanoparticles . For the development of an optimal EV delivery system , it is important to consider the biomaterials role on EV release and their functionality , but also to provide a suitable environment that facilitates tissue - speci ﬁ c regeneration . Several studies have demonstrated the osteoinductive capacity of chitosan and collagen biomaterials ( Wang and Stegemann , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2011 ) , thus providing an appropriate platform to support EV - induced regeneration . Moreover , to initiate thermo - gelation in chitosan hydrogels , β - GP was incorporated to facilitate its sol - gel transition at physiological temperatures . It has been previously reported that osteoblast - derived EVs require a phosphate - rich environment to facilitate hBMSCs mineralisation ( Davies et al . , 2017 ) . Therefore , the incorporation of β - GP provides the sol - gel transition of chitosan and a phosphate source to promote EV - induced mineralisation . Hence , in this present study , we investigated the in ﬂ uence of EV - functionalised chitosan - collagen hydrogel to stimulate encapsulated hBMSCs osteogenic differentiation . In this work , the 65 / 35 composite was utilised as it provides a suitable balance between compressive modulus , osteogenic properties and EV release kinetics . Moreover , several studies have reported the successful utilisation of chitosan - collagen hydrogels at similar ratios ( Wang and Stegemann , 2010 ; Sun et al . , 2011 ) . We initially showed that the encapsulated hBMSCs remained viable within the 65 / 35 composite hydrogel , consistent with ﬁ ndings in the literature ( Wang and Stegemann , 2010 ) . Moreover , our results showed an EV dose - dependent increase in cell proliferation within the hydrogel . This suggest that the incorporated EVs retained their biological functionality , further promoting hBMSCs proliferation in a dose - dependent manner . Importantly , we demonstrated that the EV - functionalised composite gels signi ﬁ cantly enhanced hBMSCs osteogenic differentiation and mineralisation when compared to the EV - free groups , consistent with observations in the literature ( Man et al . , 2021b ) . Similar to the effects on proliferation , our ﬁ ndings showed an EV dose - dependent increase in mineralisation within the hydrogel , consistent with the concentration - dependent increase in hBMSCs mineralisation observed within a GelMA nanocomposite hydrogel ( Man et al . , 2022 ) . These ﬁ ndings further signify the ef ﬁ cacy of encapsulated EVs in stimulating hBMSCs osteogenesis within this hydrogel system . Taken together , these ﬁ ndings demonstrate the 65 / 35 composite hydrogel provides a biocompatible environment that facilitates EV - induced stem cell mineralisation , indicating the therapeutic viability of this acellular approach to stimulate bone regeneration . In summary , we demonstrated the development of an injectable pro - osteogenic chitosan - collagen composite hydrogel capable of controlling the release of osteoblast - derived EVs and Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www . frontiersin . org March 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 829969 14 Man et al . ECM - Mimetic Hydrogel Promotes Vesicle - Induced Mineralisation promote the recruitment / mineralisation of hBMSCs . We reported the impact of changing chitosan - collagen content on augmenting the hydrogels gelation time , compressive modulus , osteoinductive properties and EV release kinetics . Moreover , we showed that EVs either released or encapsulated within the composite hydrogel retained their capacity to stimulate hBMSCs proliferation and mineralisation . Having demonstrated the in ﬂ uence of chitosan and collagen composition on EV release kinetics in vitro , future in vivo testing will be employed to further validate the capacity of this ECM - composite hydrogel to improve EV half - life . As it is dif ﬁ cult to replicate the systemic or local delivery of EVs in vitro , this would be an important group to include in future in vivo testing . Moreover , future studies investigating the potential of EV - functionalised chitosan - collagen hydrogels to stimulate bone regeneration within critical - sized bone defects in vivo would provide increased pre - clinical evidence into the ef ﬁ cacy of this EV - based approach to promote bone regeneration . CONCLUSION Together , these ﬁ ndings demonstrate the development of an injectable thermosensitive chitosan - collagen composite hydrogel capable of enhancing the therapeutic ef ﬁ cacy of osteoblast - derived EVs as novel acellular tools to promote bone regeneration .
