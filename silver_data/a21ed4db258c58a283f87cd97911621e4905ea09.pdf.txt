Here , we show that the epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor ( EGFR ) , when stimulatedwithlowdosesofEGF , isinternalizedalmostexclusively through the clathrin pathway , and it is not ubiquitinated . At higher concentrations of ligand , however , a substantial fraction of the receptor is endocytosed through a clathrin - independent , lipid raft - dependent route , as the receptor becomes ubiquitinated . An ubiquitination - impaired EGFR mutant was internalized through the clathrin pathway , whereas an EGFR (cid:1) ubiquitin chimera , that can signal solely through its ubiquitin ( Ub ) moiety , was internal - ized exclusively by the non - clathrin pathway . Non - clathrin inter - nalization of ubiquitinated EGFR depends on its interaction with proteins harboring the Ub - interacting motif , as shown through the ablation of three Ub - interacting motif - containing proteins , eps15 , eps15R , and epsin . Thus , eps15s and epsin perform an important function in coupling ubiquitinated cargo to clathrin - independent internalization . internalization (cid:2) rafts (cid:2) caveolae (cid:2) ubiquitination (cid:2) ubiquitin - interacting motif U biquitination is a posttranslational modification whereby substrate proteins are conjugated to a short highly con - served peptide , ubiquitin ( Ub ) , through the action of Ub ligases ( E3 enzymes ) . Polyubiquitination , in which a chain of Ub is appended , targets proteins to proteasomal degradation ( 1 ) . However , when a single Ub moiety is appended ( monoubiquiti - nation ) , the modification functions as a signaling device through interactions with intracellular proteins harboring Ub - binding domains , such as the Ub - interacting motif ( UIM ) ( 2 ) . In yeast , monoubiquitination has been known to act as an internalization signal for quite some time ( 3 ) . In mammals , however , this connection has remained more elusive . We are interested in the mechanisms of internalization of receptor tyrosine kinases and , in particular , the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . The EGFR is monoubiquiti - nated at multiple sites ( 4 ) through the action of the E3 enzyme Cbl . Although there is consensus on the function of Cbl and receptor ubiquitination in intracellular sorting of the EGFR , their role in the internalization step of endocytosis is less clear ( 5 , 6 ) . To gain insight into this issue , we generated a chimera in which the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the EGFR are fused to a mutant Ub ( Ubmut ) , unable to form polyUb chains ( EGFR (cid:1) Ubmut ) . With this chimera , we showed that ubiquitination is sufficient for internalization ( 4 ) . The present studies were undertaken to elucidate the molecular mechanisms through which receptor ubiquitination directs internalization . Materials and Methods Transfection and Biochemical Studies . Transfections were per - formed by using Lipofectamine or Oligofectamine ( Invitrogen ) . For biochemical experiments , cells were serum - starved and then stimulated with EGF ( 100 ng (cid:1) ml , unless otherwise indicated ) at 37°C . Lysis , immunoprecipitation , and immunoblotting were performed as described in ref . 7 . Plasmids , pharmacological agents , and antibodies are described in Supporting Materials and Methods , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site . Gene Silencing . Gene silencing of eps15 , eps15R , or epsin was obtained by pSUPER vectors encoding specific targeting se - quences . Two distinct small interfering RNAs (cid:1) targets were tested , with comparable results . Stable clones were obtained by cotransfection with a plasmid carrying puromycin resistance . Three independent clones were analyzed with similar results . Silencing of clathrin heavy chain was by transient transfection of two different short interfering RNA oligos ( which yielded com - parable results ) directed against the two previously described sequences ( 8 , 9 ) . Further details are in Supporting Materials and Methods . Immunofluorescence and Internalization Studies . Immunofluores - cence , internalization of rhodaminated ligands , 125 I - EGF or 13A9 antibody were performed as described in ref . 4 . At the single cell level , endocytosis was monitored both by rhodamine - EGF and by anti - EGFR 13A9 antibody ( which does not interfere with EGFR internalization ) with comparable results ( only one of the two procedures is shown in the pictures ) . Rhodaminated EGF ( 1 (cid:1) g (cid:1) ml ) or the 13A9 antibody ( 20 (cid:1) g (cid:1) ml in the presence of EGF ) were added for 1 h at 0°C , followed by wash and shift at 37°C for 20 – 30 min to allow internalization . After fixation , 13A9 was detected with Cy3 - conjugated secondary antibody . In assays with anti - hemagglutinin ( anti - HA ) ( see Fig . 6 B ) , 20 (cid:1) g (cid:1) ml anti - HA was substituted for 13A9 . Quantitation was performed on at least two experiments , in duplicate ( (cid:1) 100 cells per condition ) . Plasma membrane staining was compared with intracellular vesicle - associated staining . Internalizing cells dis - played preponderant intracellular staining but little , if any , plasma membrane staining . Noninternalizing cells displayed the opposite phenotype . Immunoelectron Microscopy . For preembedding immunolabeling ( Figs . 1 A and 2 B Left and Center and Table 1 ) , starved prechilled cells were incubated on ice for 30 min with 20 (cid:1) g (cid:1) ml anti - EGFR 13A9 , then with rabbit anti - mouse ( code no . ZO412 , DAKO ) , and finally with 10 - nm protein A - gold . Cells were then incubated at 37°C for 2 min with EGF ( at the indicated doses ) , fixed for 15 min at room temperature ( 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M caco - dylate buffer , pH 7 . 2 ) , and processed as described in ref . 10 .

Further details are in Supporting Materials and Methods . Results In HeLa cells , expressing endogenous EGFR , we found that EGFR follows different internalization routes , depending on the dose of EGF . We used two concentrations of EGF ( low EGF , 1 . 5 ng (cid:1) ml ; high EGF , 20 ng (cid:1) ml ) , both within the range of physio - logical EGF levels ( 1 – 2 ng (cid:1) ml in serum ; 10 – 100 ng (cid:1) ml in several other biological fluids , see Supporting Materials and Methods ) . At low EGF , EGFR localized predominantly into clathrin - coated pits , whereas , at high EGF , the receptor was roughly equally partitioned between coated pits and caveolae ( Fig . 1 A and Table 1 ) . At low EGF , the receptor was significantly tyrosine phos - phorylated and fully competent for downstream signaling ( as demonstrated by activation of ERK ) , whereas significant ubiq - uitination was only detectable at high EGF ( Fig . 1 B ) . Thus , there is correlation between the state of EGFR ubiquitination and its partition into caveolae . We have shown that a chimera encompassing the extracellular and transmembrane domain of the EGFR fused to Ub ( EGFR (cid:1) Ubmut ) is constitutively internalized ( 4 ) . By exploiting this chimera , whose internalization exclusively depends on the sig - naling abilities of the Ub moiety , we endeavored to determine how ubiquitination directs internalization . In EGFR - negative NR6 ( Fig . 2 A ) or Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) ( data not shown ) cells , the internalized EGFR (cid:1) Ubmut colocalized exten - sively with caveolin - 1 , a marker of the non - clathrin lipid raft (cid:1) caveolar pathway , but poorly with clathrin , whereas a transfected EGFR ( EGFRwt ) showed the opposite behavior ( Fig . 2 A ) . By immunoelectron microscopy , we detected EGFR (cid:1) Ubmut exclu - sively in caveolae ( Fig . 2 B ) , whereas EGFRwt partitioned be - tween coated pits and caveolae , with preference for coated pits ( data not shown ) .

Next , we used pharmacological and dominant negative inhib - itors of endocytosis and comparatively tested their effects on EGFRwt , EGFR (cid:1) Ubmut , and a mutant EGFR ( Y1045F ) , that cannot efficiently recruit Cbl ( 11 ) , thus showing considerably reduced ubiquitination ( Fig . 3 A ) . All these constructs were expressed in EGFR - negative CHO or NR6 cells . In an initial set of experiments , we monitored internalization of rhodamine - conjugated EGF ( Fig . 3 B and C ; see Fig . 8 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . DynaminII - K44A , a general endocytic inhibitor ( 12 , 13 ) , abro - gated internalization of EGFR (cid:1) Ubmut , EGFRwt , and Y1045F ( Fig . 3 B ) . Conversely , a mutant eps15 ( (cid:3) 95 (cid:1) 295 ) , which inter - feres predominantly with AP2 ( 14 ) , or an amphiphysin fragment ( A1 (cid:1) SRR ) that selectively interferes with clathrin ( 15 ) was ineffective on endocytosis of EGFR (cid:1) Ubmut , while reducing internalization of EGFRwt and Y1045F ( Fig . 3 B ) . Pharmaco - logical tools ( filipin , nystatin , and low - dose genistein ) that allow preferential interference with non - clathrin internalization ( 16 , 17 ) effectively inhibited the internalization of EGFR (cid:1) Ubmut ( Fig . 3 C ) . Of note , a different chimeric receptor harboring the extracellular domain of the transferrin receptor and intracellular Ub , was also internalized through a nystatin and filipin - sensitive pathway , whereas the wild - type transferrin receptor , which is internalized exclusively through coated pits , was insensitive to these drugs ( Fig . 9 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . EGFRwt was inhibited by the drugs to a lesser , albeit significant , extent ( Fig . 3 C ) . Conversely , the internalization of the Y1045F mutant was insensitive to these inhibitors ( Fig . 3 C ) . A quantitative assessment was obtained by measuring the internalization of 125 I - EGF ( Fig . 3 D ) . At high EGF , although the internalization of EGFRwt was partially sensitive to filipin , the drug had no significant effect on endocytosis of the Y1045 mutant , but it reduced the internalization of EGFR (cid:1) Ubmut to background levels ( Fig . 3 D ) . How does Ub couple with the intracellular machinery of non - clathrin endocytosis ? A family of UIM - containing proteins has been implicated in endocytosis , with eps15 and epsin func - tioning at the plasma membrane ( 10 , 18 , 19 ) and hepatocyte growth factor receptor substrate ( HRS ) in endosomes ( 20 ) . These proteins coimmunoprecipitated with EGFR (cid:1) Ubmut ( Fig . 4 A ) and were also found in caveolae containing the chimera and caveolin - 1 ( Fig . 4 B ) . In addition , the overexpression of an isolated UIM inhibited the internalization of EGFR (cid:1) Ubmut but not of the transferrin receptor ( Fig . 4 C ) . Finally , when EGFR (cid:1) Ubmut was modified , such as to harbor a Ub moiety incapable of interacting with UIMs ( 21 ) , it could not be internalized any longer ( Fig . 10 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . UIM proteins also coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous EGFR in a ligand - dependent fashion and with a time kinetic compatible with function ( s ) at different stations of the endocytic route ( Fig . 5 A ) . Of interest , eps15 showed a second peak of association at late time points , suggesting an additional role ( s ) at the endosomal level , as also recently suggested ( 22 ) . The association depended on the presence of Ub and functional UIMs , as shown by the lack of coimmunoprecipitation of Y1045F with the three UIM proteins ( Fig . 5 B ) and the lack of endogenous EGFR with mutant eps15 and epsin , which were carrying deletions in their UIMs ( Fig . 5 C ) . Thus , Ub , either biosynthetically added to EGFR (cid:1) Ubmut or posttranslationally appended to EGFR , might direct the receptors to non - clathrin internalization through an interaction ( s ) with UIM proteins . To address this point , we knocked down ( KD ) eps15 , eps15R ( a related protein ) , and epsin in HeLa cells ( Fig . 6 A ) . The endocytosis of EGFR (cid:1) Ubmut was abrogated in triple eps15 (cid:1) eps15R (cid:1) epsin KD cells but not in individual KD cells ( Fig . 6 B ; see Fig . 11 A , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . The reexpression of eps15 but not of an eps15 - UIM - deleted mutant in the triple KD cells restored the internalization of EGFR (cid:1) Ubmut ( Fig . 6B , see Fig . 11 B ) . Thus , Fig . 3 .

The rate of internalization is expressed as internalized (cid:1) surface - bound radioactivity . Actual images of the experiments described for B and C are in Fig . 8 . 2762 (cid:2) www . pnas . org (cid:1) cgi (cid:1) doi (cid:1) 10 . 1073 (cid:1) pnas . 0409817102 Sigismund et al . when a membrane protein is exclusively internalized as a func - tion of its ubiquitination in a nystatin (cid:1) filipin - sensitive pathway , the interaction with the UIM proteins eps15 (cid:1) eps15R (cid:1) epsin is essential . In addition , the functions of eps15 (cid:1) eps15R and epsin are redundant in this pathway . We then investigated the behavior of the endogenous EGFR . Initially , we investigated the role of clathrin because discordant results have been reported ( 8 , 9 , 23 ) . We reasoned that the scarce effect of clathrin KD in one of these studies could be explained by the use of high EGF in the internalization assay ( 8 ) .

As shown in Fig . 6C , at low EGF , the KD of clathrin ( levels of clathrin in KD cells are in Fig . 6 A ) almost completely abrogated internalization , demonstrating that , under this condition , clathrin is absolutely required . Next , we tested whether UIM - containing proteins are required in this pathway . At low EGF , although the individual KDs of eps15 (cid:1) eps15R or epsin had no effect , the triple eps15 (cid:1) eps15R (cid:1) epsin KD exhibited a significant decrease in EGFR internalization ( Fig . 6 C ) . Treatment with filipin had no effect in any of the KDs at low EGF ( Fig . 6 D ) . These results are in agreement with those reported by Huang et al . ( 23 ) and dem - onstrate that eps15 (cid:1) eps15R and epsin participate ( redundantly ) also in the clathrin pathway . However , they are not strictly essential , as clathrin endocytosis proceeds also in their absence . At high EGF , clathrin KD reduced internalization by (cid:4) 50 % . However , filipin treatment of clathrin KD cells reduced the residual internalization to background levels ( Fig . 6 D ) . These results show the existence of two modalities of internalization , one relying on clathrin ( at low EGF ) and one relying both on clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent pathways ( at high EGF ) . The triple eps15 (cid:1) eps15R (cid:1) epsin KD also reduced EGFR endocytosis at high EGF , albeit in a filipin - insensitive fashion , demonstrating that , in the triple KD , the non - clathrin nystatin (cid:1) filipin - sensitive component of EGFR endocytosis is completely abolished ( Fig . 6 D ) . Individual KDs of eps15 (cid:1) eps15R or epsin had no effect , reinforcing the notion of redundancy among these proteins ( data not shown ) . Finally , the quadruple eps15 (cid:1) eps15R (cid:1) epsin (cid:1) clathrin KD reduced EGFR internalization at high and low doses to background levels ( Fig . 6 C and D ) . Together with data obtained with EGFR (cid:1) Ubmut , these results prove that eps15 (cid:1) eps15R and epsin are ( redundantly ) indispens - able to the non - clathrin internalization of the EGFR . Discussion Our studies unveil important differences in the mechanisms through which the EGFR couples with the machinery of inter - nalization as a function of EGF dose . At low doses of ligand , the receptor is almost exclusively internalized through a clathrin - dependent mechanism , whereas , at higher doses , a non - clathrin pathway defined on the basis of its nystatin (cid:1) filipin - sensitivity emerges and becomes as relevant as the clathrin pathway . Of note , low and high EGF concentrations are physiologically relevant , as discussed in Supporting Materials and Methods . The emergence of the non - clathrin pathway correlates with the appearance of detectable ubiquitinated EGFR . A molecular genetics approach provided a mechanistic basis for this corre - lation , because a mutant EGFR that can no longer be ubiqui - tinated ( Y1045F ) was internalized through the clathrin pathway , even at high doses of EGF . The dependence of the non - clathrin pathway on ubiquitina - tion was further confirmed by a reductionistic approach , which exploited chimeric molecules that can signal solely through an Ub moiety . It should also be pointed out that such molecules are not ‘‘true’’ representations of receptors . In the case of the EGFR - based chimera , we have previously demonstrated that the chimera is constitutively internalized and routed to the degra - dative compartment , even in the absence of ligand stimulation ( 4 ) . Once , however , the relevance of ubiquitination in non - clathrin endocytosis was established on the holo - EGFR , as discussed above , the chimera proved very useful in simplifying the plethora of signals present on an activated receptor and in allowing studies of internalization solely as a function of cargo ubiquitination . Our results are consistent with data showing that EGFR internalization through clathrin - coated pits requires Cbl but not receptor ubiquitination ( 5 , 24 ) . These latter findings also indi - rectly stress the importance of Cbl - executed ubiquitination of other downstream endocytic proteins for proper clathrin endo - cytosis . A recent report by Stang et al . ( 25 ) , which shows that Cbl - dependent ubiquitination is required for progression of the EGFR into coated pits , further reinforces this notion . Taken Fig . 6 .

At higher doses of EGF , however , when cargo ubiquitina - tion becomes substantial , endocytosis is partially switched to a non - clathrin pathway . How is this ‘‘switch’’ achieved ? Our results directly implicate the recruitment of eps15 (cid:1) eps15R and epsin to the ubiquitinated cargo , as also shown by findings that expression of the EGFR (cid:1) Ub chimera was able to induce relocalization of these proteins into caveolae . In addition , we showed that these proteins are redun - dantly essential in non - clathrin endocytosis of the EGFR . How the signal is further propagated downstream of these molecules in this pathway is not known and warrants further investigation . Furthermore , other Ub - binding proteins have been implicated in endocytosis . Thus , their potential role in the internalization of ubiquitinated cargo , possibly in a cell - specific fashion , also appears worth investigating . Our results also indicate a role ( albeit nonessential ) for eps15 (cid:1) eps15R and epsin in clathrin internalization . Indeed , these proteins have been implicated in the formation of coated pits , and they have been proposed to function as adaptors between ubiquitinated cargo and components of the coat , such as AP2 and clathrin ( 2 , 26 ) . This latter possibility seems unlikely based on our present data , at least under a condition in which the clathrin route is paramount at low EGF concentrations , simply because there is not sufficient cargo ubiquitination at these doses . However , we have previously shown that clathrin - dependent synaptic vesicle recycling in Caenorhabditis elegans is negatively affected by the removal of eps15 through a mechanism that involves a genetic interaction with dynamin ( 27 ) . It is possible , therefore , that , at least in the case of eps15 , participa - tion to clathrin endocytosis involves mechanisms different from interactions with ubiquitinated cargo . Finally , we note that the TGF - (cid:3) receptor internalizes through coated pits and caveolae ( 28 ) . The two pathways were associated with increased receptor signaling and rapid receptor degrada - tion , respectively ( 28 ) . In the case of EGFR , at low EGF ( when internalization proceeds exclusively through coated pits ) , the receptor is already fully competent for effector signaling ( Fig . 1 B ) . Conversely , at high EGF ( when non - clathrin endocytosis becomes significant ) , there is no increase in signaling abilities but readily detectable increase in EGFR down - regulation ( Fig . 1 B ) . Thus , at minimum , caveolar (cid:1) raft internalization does not ap - parently contribute to EGFR signaling , and possibly it is pref - erentially associated with receptor degradation .
