The term JIA encompasses a heterogeneous group of diseases that is classified according to three major types of presentation : oligoarthritis , polyarthritis , and systemic onset JIA ( SoJIA ) . Each of these groups has different prognosis and responds dif - ferently to available therapies ( 1 – 4 ) , suggesting that their pathogenesis is also unique . Children with SoJIA usually present with systemic symptoms , fever and / or rash , which precede the development of arthritis for weeks or even years . Once arthritis develops , these patients have a highly variable disease outcome . The overall prognosis correlates with the persis - tence of systemic symptoms and the number of joints involved 6 mo after the initial presenta - tion ( 5 – 8 ) . Because of lack of success with con - ventional treatment , up to 50 % of patients with SoJIA continue to have active arthritis 5 – 10 yr after diagnosis ( 2 , 9 , 10 ) . Because long - term disability is directly correlated with duration of active disease , this group has the most severe outcome and thus has represented the most se - rious challenge to pediatric rheumatologists . We have recently shown that IL - 1 is a major mediator of the inflammatory cascade under - lying SoJIA ( 11 ) . Indeed , IL - 1Ra is an effective treatment for this disease ( 11 – 14 ) . IL - 1 is also involved in the pathogenesis of familial auto - inflammatory syndromes ( 15 – 17 ) , and blocking CORRESPONDENCE Virginia Pascual : Virginip @ Baylorhealth . edu OR Jacques Banchereau : Jacquesb @ Baylorhealth . edu OR Damien Chaussabel : Damienc @ Baylorhealth . edu Abbreviations used : CLIC - 2 , chloride intracellular channel 2 ; JIA , juvenile idiopathic arthritis ; mDC , myeloid DC ; pDC , plasmacytoid DC ; SLE , systemic lupus erythematosus ; SoJIA , systemic onset JIA .

We recently reported that interleukin ( IL ) 1 is an important mediator of this disease and that IL - 1 blockade induces clinical remission . However , lack of specificity of the initial systemic manifestations leads to delays in diagnosis and initiation of therapy . To develop a specific diagnostic test , we analyzed leukocyte gene expression profiles of 44 pediatric SoJIA patients , 94 pediatric patients with acute viral and bacterial infections , 38 pediatric patients with systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , 6 patients with PAPA syn - drome , and 39 healthy children . Statistical group comparison and class prediction identified genes differentially expressed in SoJIA patients compared with healthy children . These genes , however , were also changed in patients with acute infections and SLE . An analysis of significance across all diagnostic groups identified 88 SoJIA - specific genes , 12 of which accurately classified an independent set of SoJIA patients with systemic disease . Transcripts that changed significantly in patients undergoing IL - 1 blockade were also identified . Thus , leukocyte transcriptional signatures can be used to distinguish SoJIA from other febrile illnesses and to assess response to therapy . Availability of early diagnostic markers may allow prompt initiation of therapy and prevention of disabilities . T h e J ou r n a l o f E x p e r i m e n t a l M e d i c i n e 2132 DIAGNOSTIC SIGNATURES IN S o JIA BLOOD LEUKOCYTES | Allantaz et al . Two additional febrile patients ( Sys 85 and Sys 91 ; Table S1 ) were studied but later proved to have a different diagnosis . Samples from 11 patients with established diagnosis of SoJIA in whom the systemic symptoms had subsided but arthritis persisted ( SoJIA 2 ) and 14 patients with no systemic symp - toms and no arthritis at the time of blood draw ( SoJIA 3 ) were also analyzed . The demographic and clinical characteristics of these patients are summarized in Table S1 . 20 ml of blood was drawn after informed consent . PBMCs were isolated within 2 – 4 h and processed and analyzed using Affymetrix human U133A and U133B GeneChips . Blood leukocyte signatures differentiate SoJIA patients from healthy children To identify genes whose expression would differentiate SoJIA patients ( n  16 ) from healthy controls ( n  16 ) , statistical group comparisons were performed using the nonparametric Mann - Whitney rank test ( P  0 . 01 ) and Bonferroni correc - tion . Transcripts displaying statistically significant differences ( n  873 , 398 up - regulated and 475 down - regulated ) were ordered by hierarchical clustering ( Fig . 1 and Table S2 , which is available at http : / / www . jem . org / cgi / content / full / jem . 20070070 / DC1 ) . The 50 most significant genes are listed in IL - 1 with IL - 1Ra resolves the clinical symptoms of patients carrying mutations in the NALP3 / cryopyrin gene ( familial cold urticaria , Muckle - Wells syndrome , and NOMID / CINCA ) ( 18 – 21 ) and in the PSTPIP1 gene ( PAPA syndrome , a familial autoinflammatory disease that causes pyogenic sterile arthritis , pyoderma gangrenosum , and acne ) ( 22 , 23 ) . The diagnosis of SoJIA is currently based on clinical find - ings and requires the presence of arthritis ( 24 ) . Because this manifestation may take months to develop , one of the major remaining challenges is how to establish an early diagnosis . As the presenting symptoms ( fever and / or rash ) and laboratory tests ( anemia , leukocytosis , thrombocytosis , and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate ) are nonspecific , patients un - dergo extensive diagnostic tests and hospitalizations to exclude infections and malignancies . The availability of an effective treatment fosters the need for diagnostic markers that will per - mit the initiation of therapy at an early stage of the disease to minimize the risk of developing long - term disabilities . We have previously shown that microarray analyses of blood leukocytes from children with autoimmune diseases can be used to assess pathogenesis ( 25 , 26 ) . Here , we describe the use of blood leukocyte gene expression patterns to help diagnose patients with SoJIA during the systemic phase of the disease and to follow their response to therapy . RESuLTS Patient characteristics We analyzed 23 samples from 16 SoJIA patients display - ing systemic symptoms ( fever and / or rash ) and arthritis , and 3 SoJIA patients with only systemic symptoms ( fever , rash , and / or pericarditis ) at the time of blood draw . Four patients ( Sys12 , Sys21 , Sys25 , and Sys51 ) were analyzed twice dur - ing independent systemic flares separated by 7 – 23 mo . Eight samples from patients with long - standing disease were ob - tained at the time of systemic disease flare ( fever onset  4 preceding weeks ) . Five patients were newly diagnosed and also had had disease symptoms for no longer than 4 wk . SoJIA patients were predominantly females ( female / male , 15 / 4 ) . There were 10 Caucasian , 7 Hispanic , 1 Asian , and 1 African - American children in this group . Seven patients were not receiving any medication other than nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs at the time of blood draw . The remaining patients were receiving treatment with oral prednisone and / or IV methylprednisolone pulses , methotrexate , and / or anti - TNF therapy ( Table S1 , available at http : / / www . jem . org / cgi / content / full / jem . 20070070 / DC1 ) . However , none of the treated patients had received IV pulses ( methylprednisolone or infliximab ) for at least 4 wk before blood draw . All pa - tients fulfilled the International League of Associations for Rheumatology clinical diagnostic criteria for SoJIA ( 24 ) at the time of blood draw , during previous disease flares , or after blood draw . The average time from initiation of symptoms to establishment of diagnosis and initiation of therapy in these patients was 4 . 8 mo ( range , 6 wk – 3 yr ) . If the patient with the longest time to diagnosis ( 3 yr ) is excluded , the average time to diagnosis for the remaining patient group was 2 . 7 mo . Figure 1 . Differential gene expression in PBMCs isolated from SoJIA patients and healthy controls . 17 , 454 genes passing the control criteria were tested . Genes expressed at statistically different levels between the two groups ( P  0 . 01 ; Wilcoxon - Mann - Whitney test , Bonferroni correction ) were rearranged by hierarchical clustering to reveal differential expression . Expression values are normalized per gene to the healthy group . Transformed expression levels are indicated by color scale , with red representing relative high expression and blue indicating relative low expression .

Using this strategy , 100 % of the healthy and 88 % of the SoJIA samples were classified accu - rately ( seven were predicted accurately , and the class of the remaining sample was indeterminate ) . The ability of these transcripts to classify a test set composed of eight new healthy and eight independent SoJIA patients was tested . Using this approach , 100 % of the patients and controls were accurately classified ( Fig . 2 A , right ) . Some of the up - regulated transcripts that best classify SoJIA patients encode proteins involved in heme synthesis ( delta hemoglobin and erythroid - associated factor ) and erythrocyte - specific transcription factors ( Kruppel - like factor 1 ) , which could be related to the presence of nucleated erythroid pre - cursors in SoJIA blood as described above . Lack of specificity of the SoJIA signature Children with SoJIA present with severe systemic symptoms ( fever and rash ) that usually precede the development of arthritis from weeks to years . Thus , the main differential diagnosis at presentation is an infectious disease . The 50 best Table S2 ( marked with an asterisk ) . The expression of some of these genes can be interpreted based on our current knowledge of the disease . Related to the frequent anemia and the presence of erythroblasts in the blood of these patients , many erythroid lineage - specific genes are found up - regulated . Likewise , neutrophil - specific genes and genes that promote neutrophil survival ( i . e . , Foxo3a ) ( 27 ) are found overexpressed . This is consistent with the neutrophilia pre - sent in SoJIA patients . Many of the over - and underexpressed genes , however , cannot be linked to a particular cell type or function . To identify a potential diagnostic signature , a two - step class prediction analysis was performed . It consisted of the identi - fication of classifier genes and the validation of these genes in an independent cohort of patients and controls . A subset of eight healthy volunteers and eight patients with an established diagnosis of SoJIA was used as a training set to identify the classifier genes ( Fig . 2 A , left ) . The 50 most significantly differentially expressed transcripts ( Table I ) were then evaluated within the same set of patients in a leave - one - Figure 2 . Class prediction . ( A ) ( Left ) Eight healthy and eight SoJIA samples obtained from our initial study group were used as a training set to generate a list of classifier genes displaying the best ability to discriminate patients from healthy controls . In our training set , 100 % of healthy and 88 % of SoJIA patients were classified accurately . ( Right ) Those classifier genes were then tested on a test set ( eight Healthy and eight SoJIA ) , and 100 % of patients were classified accurately . Expression values were normalized per gene to the healthy group . Samples and genes were arranged by hierarchical clustering . Transformed expression levels are indicated by color scale , with red representing relative high expression and blue indicating relative low expression .

Genes are grouped based on functional ontology . SoJIA classifier transcripts described above were next tested for their ability to discriminate SoJIA patients from patients with infections ( 31 patients with Staphylococcus aureus , 15 patients with Streptococcus pneumoniae , 30 patients with Escherichia coli , and 18 patients with influenza A ) . As controls for noninfec - tious disease and steroid treatment , we included a group of 38 pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) patients and 6 patients with PAPA syndrome , an IL - 1 – mediated auto - inflammatory disease . These 50 genes were also dysregulated in patients with inflammatory conditions , as 45 % of S . aureus , 47 % of S . pneumoniae , 36 % of E . coli , 5 % of Influenza A , 29 % of SLE , and 33 % of PAPA syndrome patients were in - correctly classified as SoJIA ( Fig . 2 B ) . Some of the genes included in the 50 best classifiers were mildly dysregulated in patients with established SoJIA and persistent arthritis , but not systemic symptoms ( SoJIA 2 ) and in asymptomatic patients ( SoJIA 3 ) ( Fig . S1 A , available at http : / / www . jem . org / cgi / content / full / jem . 20070070 / DC1 ) . These patients , however , were correctly discriminated from the patients with systemic disease ( Fig . S1 B ) . Thus , the comparison of transcripts from SoJIA PBMCs and healthy controls is insufficient to yield SoJIA - specific signatures . Furthermore , the blood transcription patterns of SoJIA patients during the systemic phase of the disease are closer to those of patients with infections than to those of SoJIA patients in later ( arthritic ) stages of the disease . Identification of a specific SoJIA signature To identify a diagnostic SoJIA signature , the transcription profiles of SoJIA patients with systemic symptoms were di - rectly compared with all the other infectious / inflammatory conditions . However , a large proportion of the predictor genes identified using this approach was found expressed similarly in SoJIA patients and healthy controls ( unpublished data ) . Because it is difficult to control potentially confound - ing factors such as age or sex when comparing more than two groups of patients , we adopted a different strategy ( see Fig . S2 , available at http : / / www . jem . org / cgi / content / full / jem . 20070070 / DC1 , and reference 28 for details ) . First , we performed statistical comparisons between each group of patients ( 16 SoJIA , 16 S . aureus , 10 S . pneumoniae , 10 E . coli , 10 influenza A , and 16 SLE ) and their respective control groups composed of age - and gender - matched healthy donors . The p - values obtained from each comparison were then subjected to selection criteria that permitted the identifica - tion of genes significantly changed in SoJIA patients versus their control group , and not in any of the other disease versus control groups . A nonstringent statistical group comparison ( nonpara - metric Mann - Whitney rank test ; P  0 . 01 ) between 16 SoJIA and 10 healthy control samples yielded 4 , 311 differentially expressed transcripts ( Fig . 3 A ) . 88 of these transcripts were expressed with a p - value of  0 . 5 in all other diseases com - pared with their corresponding healthy control groups ( Fig . 3 B and Table II ) . More than 50 % of these genes ( 47 / 88 ) encode proteins with unknown function . Among those en - coding known proteins , several are involved in microtubule / cytoskeleton reorganization , ubiquitination , cellular transport , apoptosis , metabolism , transcription , protein biosynthesis , and posttranslational protein modification ( Table II ) . The gene tree corresponding to these differentially expressed transcripts in individual patients and controls is displayed in Fig . 3 C . Only 1 of these 88 best classifiers ( AK2 ) overlapped with the 50 genes that best discriminated SoJIA patients from healthy controls ( Tables I and II ) , confirming the lack of specificity of our initial approach . 2136 DIAGNOSTIC SIGNATURES IN S o JIA BLOOD LEUKOCYTES | Allantaz et al . and 6 new ones ) and 12 SoJIA , 5 S . aureus , 4 S . pneumoniae , 5 E . coli , and 5 influenza A patients ( all from our initial microarray study ) . The results of these experiments con - firmed that expression of these eight genes is significantly To validate the microarray data , we selected the 8 / 88 best - characterized genes based on their genomic sequence to perform RT - PCR . RNA samples were obtained from 12 healthy controls ( 6 from our initial microarray analysis Figure 3 . SoJIA - specific signature . ( A ) Genes expressed at statistically different levels in the SoJIA patient group compared with healthy volunteers ( P  0 . 01 ; Wilcoxon - Mann - Whitney test ) were selected ( 4 , 311 probe sets ) . p - values were similarly obtained from patients suffering from S . aureus , S . pneumoniae , E . coli , influenza A , and SLE . Each of these cohorts was compared with the corresponding control group . p - values are represented according to color scale : turquoise , low p - value ; pink , high p - value . ( B ) 88 / 4 , 311 transcripts were found expressed at statistically different levels in the SoJIA patient group compared with healthy controls ( P  0 . 01 ; Wilcoxon - Mann - Whitney test ) , but not in all of the other groups compared with their healthy controls ( P  0 . 5 ; Wilcoxon - Mann - Whitney test ) . ( C ) The 88 genes from B were hierarchically clustered in the 107 samples used in the meta - analysis . Expression values of those 88 genes were normalized per gene to the healthy group . ( D ) The 12 most significant genes ( P  0 . 0001 in SoJIA group ) were used as predictors for an independent test set of 10 healthy patients , 9 patients with febrile syndromes to rule out the diagnosis of SoJIA ( 2 of these patients were later on found to suffer from other diseases ) , 15 S . aureus , 5 S . pneumoniae , 20 E . coli , 8 influenza A , 22 SLE , and 6 PAPA syndrome patients . Expression values of those 12 genes were normalized per gene to the healthy group . Genes were arranged by hierarchical clustering . Transformed expression levels are indicated by color scale , with red representing relative high expression and blue indicating relative low expression . The list of the 88 and 12 genes shown in B – D is displayed in Table II . ( E ) The 12 gene signature displayed in D is shown in 16 healthy controls , 23 samples from 19 patients with established diagnosis of SoJIA while presenting systemic symptoms , and 11 patients with established diagnosis of SoJIA in whom the systemic symptoms had subsided but arthritis persisted . Only one patient with confirmed clinical diagnosis of SoJIA did not display the signature while having systemic symptoms ( * ) . JEM VOL . 204 , September 3 , 2007 ARTICLE 2137 To determine if a specific cell type is preferentially con - tributing to the overrepresentation of these transcripts , their expression was analyzed in B cells , T cells , monocytes , and neutrophils from healthy donors and SoJIA patients , as well as myeloid DCs ( mDCs ) and plasmacytoid DCs ( pDCs ) from healthy donors . Interestingly , 5 / 12 transcripts showed the highest expression levels in mDCs ( not depicted ) . Within the cells that we analyzed , expression of CLIC - 2 is restricted to this cell type ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . However , whether the 12 transcript signature derives from a cell type not normally pre - sent in the blood ( i . e . , a bone marrow precursor ) needs to be ruled out . Treatment with IL - Ra ( Anakinra ) partially extinguishes the SoJIA signature The effect of IL - 1 blockade on the SoJIA - specific signature was analyzed by comparing the expression of the 873 tran - scripts that differentiate SoJIA patients from healthy controls ( Fig . 1 and Table S2 ) in eight active SoJIA patients before and after initiation of IL - 1 blockade . Anakinra was found to induce a significant change ( P  0 . 05 ) in the expression levels of 389 transcripts . The 10 most significant are displayed in Fig . 5 . They include genes encoding proteins with anti - apoptotic function ( Pim - 1 ) ( 31 ) , lysosomal ATP - ase activity ( ATP6V0A1 ) , Cdc42 - binding proteins linked to F - actin accumulation at the immunological synapse ( Cdc42SE2 ) ( 32 ) , glutamate receptor ( GRINA ) , MAP2 kinase 3 ( MAP2K3 ) , prohibitin ( PHB ) , and the solute carrier protein family ( SLC25A37 ) . Of them , only MAP2K3 has a known poten - tial link to IL - 1 , as this molecule has been shown to down - modulate IL - 1 responses on fibroblast - like synoviocytes and to regulate p38 activation in experimental inflammatory ar - thritis ( 33 , 34 ) . Only 19 of the 88 diagnostic transcripts described above ( Table II ) overlapped with the 389 transcripts that signifi - cantly changed upon IL - 1 blockade . Thus , the majority of transcripts that best differentiate SoJIA patients from patients with other inflammatory conditions do not appear to be the target of IL - 1 . This is not surprising , as IL - 1 plays an impor - tant role in other diseases included in this analysis . Therefore , IL - 1 – related genes could have been counter - selected in our analysis of significance across diseases . DISCuSSIon SoJIA is the only form of JIA in which systemic symptoms precede the appearance of joint inflammation . Because sys - temic symptoms and current laboratory tests are nonspecific , a major remaining challenge is how to establish the prompt diagnosis of the disease during the systemic phase to avoid lengthy hospitalizations and initiate effective therapy . Here , we show that gene expression patterns in blood leukocytes may be used , together with careful clinical assessment , to dis - criminate SoJIA during the systemic phase of the disease from other febrile conditions . Patients with SoJIA display a very striking pattern of leuko - cyte gene transcription when compared with healthy controls . increased in SoJIA patients , but not in infections compared with healthy controls ( Fig . S3 , available at http : / / www . jem . org / cgi / content / full / jem . 20070070 / DC1 ) . 12 genes can be used to diagnose SoJIA A more stringent analysis ( P  0 . 0001 ) permitted us to iden - tify 12 / 88 genes highly differentially expressed in SoJIA com - pared with healthy controls , but not differentially expressed ( P  0 . 5 ) in all other disease groups compared with their re - spective controls . These 12 genes are included in Table II . The ability of this set of 12 genes to identify patients with SoJIA was then validated using independent groups of pa - tients and controls . A training set composed of 10 healthy and 16 SoJIA samples was used to predict sample class for an in - dependent test set composed of a random group of 10 healthy patients , 9 patients with fever of more than 10 d in duration and negative bacterial cultures ( suspected to have SoJIA ) , and 15 S . aureus , 5 S . pneumoniae , 20 E . coli , 8 influenza A , 22 SLE , and 6 PAPA syndrome patients ( Fig . 3 D ) . This analysis allowed us to accurately classify six out of seven patients ful - filling SoJIA clinical diagnostic criteria . The only SoJIA pa - tient not accurately classified ( Sys 99 in Table S1 ) had fever , rash , and arthritis at the time of blood draw and eventually responded well to treatment with steroids and methotrexate . Two additional patients who were not classified as SoJIA ( Sys 85 and Sys 91 ) were subsequently diagnosed with different diseases . Overall , 93 % of S . aureus , 100 % S . pneumoniae , 95 % of E . coli , 91 % of SLE , and 100 % of influenza A and PAPA syndrome samples were correctly discriminated from SoJIA ( Fig . 3 D ) . Thus , the “normalization” of each patient group to healthy control values and the comparison of significances rather than expression levels permitted us to extract a signature unique to the majority of SoJIA patients . The expression of the 12 transcripts was next tested in the 11 SoJIA patients described above , in whom the systemic symptoms had subsided but continued to display arthritis . As shown in Fig . 3 E , 11 / 11 patients did not differentially ex - press these genes compared with healthy controls , further in - dicating that this signature is specific to the systemic phase of the disease . Whether the dysregulated expression of these 12 genes is related to the pathogenesis of SoJIA remains to be deter - mined . Overall , seven of these genes encode uncharacterized proteins . Among those encoding proteins with known func - tion , the most significantly up - regulated transcript ( average , 8 . 2 - fold ) , chloride intracellular channel 2 ( CLIC - 2 ) , belongs to the ubiquitous glutathione transferase structural family . CLIC - 2 is one of only a few cytosolic inhibitors of cardiac ryanodine receptor 2 channels and may suppress their activity during diastole and stress ( 29 ) . Interestingly , CLIC - 2 is the only transcript encoding a protein with potential link to IL - 1 secretion , as chloride has been shown to play an important role in maintaining the P2X7 receptor ( P2X7R ) in a confor - mationally restrained state . This in turn limits the coupling of this receptor to signaling pathways that regulate caspase 1 and IL - 1b signaling cascade ( 30 ) . 2138 DIAGNOSTIC SIGNATURES IN S o JIA BLOOD LEUKOCYTES | Allantaz et al .

As age , gender , and time of day when the blood is drawn have been described to influence blood gene expres - sion patterns ( 35 ) , our samples were matched for age and gender with controls and most of them were obtained within similar time frames . There was a significant degree of overlap between the signatures of SoJIA patients and all the other inflammatory disease groups included in this study , especially Gram (  ) bac - terial infections , further stressing the need for multi - cohort studies when searching for disease - specific biomarkers . The overlap could be due to dysregulated cytokine production and / or signaling cascades that may be shared by some of these diseases . IL - 1 , for example , is important in the cascade of defense mechanisms against many bacterial infections ( 36 , 37 ) . Increased IL - 1b production has also been described in These differences might reflect changes in blood cell composi - tion , i . e . , the presence of a cell population not normally found in the blood , or fluctuations in numbers of blood - specific cell populations rather than real transcriptional changes . Active SoJIA patients , for example , display increased platelet and leukocyte numbers compared with healthy controls . Erythroid precursors , which are not normally present in peripheral blood , are also found in these patients , and erythroid - specific transcripts are among the most significantly up - regulated in SoJIA blood . To control for changes in cell composition and find a SoJIA - specific signature , we included in our analysis 138 samples from pediatric patients with systemic inflammation , including bacterial and viral infections , autoimmune ( SLE ) , and autoinflammatory ( PAPA ) diseases . Some of these pa - tients ( i . e . , bacterial infections and PAPA syndrome ) display Table II .

JEM VOL . 204 , September 3 , 2007 ARTICLE 2141 Using this approach , a SoJIA - specific signature composed of 88 genes was identified . This signature is very stable over time , as we could identify it in two samples from a patient obtained  2 yr apart ( unpublished data ) . Using a more strin - gent analysis ( P  0 . 0001 in SoJIA and P  0 . 5 in all other groups ) , 12 highly significant genes permitted to accurately classify the disease in 18 / 19 SoJIA patients . Furthermore , it allowed us to rule out SoJIA in two febrile patients who later developed arthritis but proved to suffer from different diseases . It also allowed us to discriminate systemic infections with Gram ( + ) and Gram ( − ) bacteria in 48 / 50 patients . Perhaps more interesting , six out of six patients with PAPA syn - drome were not classified as SoJIA . How this signature will perform in discriminating SoJIA patients from other auto - inflammatory diseases where IL - 1 is also dysregulated is currently being investigated . Most of the genes included within the SoJIA - specific sig - nature encode proteins that remain uncharacterized . Of those that encode known proteins , we did not find any obvious components of the IL - 1 pathway . As discussed above , this might be expected as IL - 1 also plays an important role in the inflammatory response against some of the infectious diseases autoinflammatory diseases including PAPA syndrome . Indeed , PAPA patients display a mutation in the PSTPIP1 gene ( 22 ) that exerts a dominant - negative effect on the activity of pyrin and leads to increased IL - 1b production by peripheral blood leukocytes ( 16 ) . Interestingly , the herein described blood transcription patterns of SoJIA patients during the systemic phase of the disease are closer to those of patients with infec - tions than to those of SoJIA patients who have resolved the systemic phase but continue displaying active arthritis . This could be explained if different pathogenic events , i . e . , different cytokine cascades , were responsible for the different phases of the disease . Alternatively , the same cytokine alteration in a more localized environment ( i . e . , the joint ) may not give rise to a blood cell signature . To identify a specific blood signature that would permit the accurate differential diagnosis of SoJIA patients during the systemic phase of the disease , we designed an analysis of significance across multiple febrile inflammatory diseases and control groups . One of the advantages of this analysis is that it permits us to normalize each disease group to its own matched control group , therefore avoiding biological ( i . e . , age , gender ) or technical ( i . e . , array runs ) confounding factors . Figure 5 . Anakinra effect on the specific SoJIA signature . Transcription levels ( raw values ) corresponding to the genes that best differentiate SoJIA patients from healthy controls ( from Fig . 1 and Table S2 ) were analyzed before and after the initiation of Anakinra in eight patients . The 10 genes with most significant p - values are displayed ( p - values were calculated using a paired , two - tailed t test ) . 2142 DIAGNOSTIC SIGNATURES IN S o JIA BLOOD LEUKOCYTES | Allantaz et al . S . pneumoniae ( 3 . 1 yr ; 2 mo – 16 yr ) , 18 with influenza A infections ( 1 . 5 yr ; 3 wk – 16 yr ) , 38 patients with SLE ( 12 yr ; 5 – 18 yr ) , and 6 patients with PAPA syndrome ( 32 . 6 yr ; 11 – 68 yr ) . Patients were divided in training and test sets according to age and treatment ( Table S1 ) . Subjects were recruited at Texas Scottish Rite Hospital and Children’s Medical Center of Dallas . Healthy controls included patients with hypermobility attending the rheumatology clinic and healthy children undergoing routine surgical procedures with no history of asthma , acute infections , or inflammatory conditions . Most of the samples were obtained between 9 : 00 a . m . and 12 : 00 p . m . The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of UT Southwestern Medical Center , Texas Scottish Rite Hospital , and Baylor Health Care System , and informed consent was obtained from all patients ( legal representatives and patients over 10 yr of age ) . Bacterial and viral infections were confirmed by standard bacterial cultures , direct fluorescent antigen testing , and viral cultures . Patients with infections were recruited once a confirmed microbiologic diagnosis was established . Respiratory viral cultures were performed in 60 of 73 ( 82 % ) patients with bacterial infections . The clinical and demographic characteristics of these patients are summarized in Table S1 and have been reported elsewhere ( 41 ) . PAPA syndrome patients were diagnosed based on clinical data and sequencing the PSTPIP1 gene . RNA and microarray sample preparation from PBMC and blood cell subpopulations . All blood samples were obtained in EDTA purple - top tubes ( BD Vaccutainer ) . Fresh PBMCs were isolated via Ficoll gradient . Cells were lysed in RLT lysis buffer containing  - mercaptoethanol ( QIAGEN ) . pDCs and mDCs were purified from a healthy donor’s buffy coats . Ficoll - enriched PBMCs were depleted of lineage  cells with CD3 , CD14 , CD19 , CD16 , CD56 , and glycophorin A microbeads ( Miltenyi Biotec ) . After staining with lineage cocktail - FITC , CD11c - allophycocyanin , and CD123 - PE ( BD - Biosciences ) , and HLA - DR - QR ( Sigma - Aldrich ) mAbs , cells were sorted on a FACSVantage ( Becton Dickinson ) to at least 99 % purity . Monocytes , B cells , and T cells were positively selected from PBMCs using CD14 microbeads , CD19 microbeads , or CD3 microbeads ( Miltenyi Biotec ) and MS column ( Miltenyi Biotec ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions to at least 95 % purity . Neutrophils were isolated from venous blood of healthy volunteers by dextran ( GE Healthcare ) sedimentation of erythrocytes and density gradient centrifugation of leukocytes . The resulting cell populations contained  2 % contaminating cells . Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit ( QIAGEN ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions , and the RNA integrity was assessed by using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer ( Agilent ) . For PBMCs and neutrophils , 5  g of total RNA was used to generate double - stranded cDNA containing the T7 - dT ( 24 ) promoter sequence ( Operon ) as a template for in vitro transcription single - round amplification with biotin labels , using the Enzo R BioArrayTm HighYieldTM RNA Transcript Labeling kit ( Affymetrix , Inc . ) . For the other cell subtypes , the same protocol was used starting with 50 ng of total RNA and performing two rounds of amplification . Biotinylated cRNA tar - gets were purified using the Sample Cleanup Module ( Affymetrix , Inc . ) and hybridized to human U133A and B GeneChips ( Affymetrix , Inc . ) according to the manufacturer’s standard protocols . Arrays were scanned using a laser confocal scanner ( Agilent ) . Microarray data analysis . For each Affymetrix U133A and B GeneChip , raw intensity data were normalized to the mean intensity of all measure - ments on that array and scaled to a target intensity value of 500 ( TGT ) in Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5 . 0 . Data were then further analyzed using GeneSpring software version 7 . 0 . Data were normalized to a set of healthy controls ( sex - and age - matched ) . An Affymetrix flag of “present” in at least 75 % of samples of each cohort designated the filter of reliable intensity mea - surement from each individual gene chip . The combined two lists ( 17 , 231 probes ) were used as quality control for statistical tests , class prediction , and clustering algorithms subsequently performed on the data . Class comparison was performed using nonparametric ranking statistical analysis test ( Mann - Whitney ) applied to quality control genes . In the vertical direction , hierar - chical clusters of genes were generated using the Spearman correlation . Class included in this study . IL - 1 – related genes would have there - fore been counter - selected . CLIC - 2 , the most up - regulated of the 12 transcripts that compose the SoJIA - specific signature , might be involved in the regulation of IL - 1 secretion . This gene encodes a chloride channel , and chloride levels control the conformation of P2X7R ( 30 ) . This in turn limits the coupling of this receptor to signaling pathways that regu - late caspase 1 and IL - 1b signaling cascade . Interestingly , ex - pression of CLIC - 2 within PBMCs seems to be restricted to mDCs ( 38 ) . IL - 1 amplifies DC function , and IL - 1 production is induced when monocytes are co - cultured with alloreactive T cells and autologous DCs through a cell contact – dependent mechanism ( 39 ) . Studies are currently underway to determine whether these genes are up - regulated in SoJIA blood mDCs or in a different cell population not normally present in the blood of healthy and infected children . Even though the clinical symptoms were controlled in the majority of SoJIA patients treated with an IL - 1 receptor antagonist , expression of only a fraction ( 389 / 873 ) of the dysregulated transcripts returned to control levels in treated patients . Several explanations might be put forward to ex - plain this observation . IL - 1 could be downstream of a factor present in SoJIA serum that is not blocked by Anakinra . In - deed , the residual SoJIA signature might be a tool to identify such an IL - 1 – inducing factor . The IL - 1 antagonist effect of Anakinra may be sufficient to silence the clinical symptoms , but not to erase the molecular signature . Finally , our limited patient sample before and after Anakinra treatment may not be enough to give statistical power to this analysis , and more patients may need to be studied to draw firm conclusions . The small number of genes identified in this study as SoJIA - specific might help in the diagnosis of patients with febrile conditions included under the term “fever of unknown origin . ” They might also allow to promptly initiate specific therapy in SoJIA patients even before arthritis develops , thus avoiding the need for additional therapies and the develop - ment of long - term disabilities . The identification of genes whose expression is restored back to normal levels upon successful IL - 1 blockade might also help identify predictors of response to therapy in longitudinal studies . SoJIA patients are heterogeneous , however , regarding severity of symptoms and disease course ( 38 , 40 ) . Further studies will therefore be required to confirm the value of blood gene transcription profiling in establishing the diagno - sis and predicting the response to IL - 1 blockade in larger patient cohorts . MATERIALS AND METHODS Patient information . Blood samples were obtained from 21 patients with clinical diagnosis of SoJIA ( 4 patients were tested twice at an interval of 1 – 2 yr ) during the systemic phase of the disease ( median age , 6 yr ; range , 2 – 17 yr ) . In two patients , subsequent clinical course ruled out this diagnosis . Samples were from 11 patients with SoJIA in the arthritis phase of the disease , 14 asymptomatic patients , and 8 patients with SoJIA treated with Anakinra ( 6 yr , 2 – 19 yr ) . These were also analyzed together with 94 patients hospitalized with active infections : 30 patients with E . coli infection ( 1 yr ; 2 wk – 16 yr ) , 31 patients with S . aureus infection ( 7 yr ; 3 mo – 18 yr ) , 15 patients with JEM VOL . 204 , September 3 , 2007 ARTICLE 2143 U19A1057234 - 02 to J .

Immunity . 20 : 319 – 325 . prediction was performed using a supervised learning algorithm , K - Nearest Neighbors Method , that assigns a sample to predefined classes in three steps : ( a ) identification of genes that have strong correlations to parameters ( pre - defined classes ) of a training set of samples ; ( b ) determination of an estimate of prediction error rates of training set by a leave - one - out cross - validation method ; and ( c ) validation with an independent test set to obtain a true pre - diction error rate . In step 1 , the Fisher exact test is used to identify genes by their degree of correlation to the predefined class ( by user ) of the training set of samples . Genes are then ranked by their predictive strength ( negative nat - ural log of p - value ) that represents the probability of obtaining the observed number of samples from each class above or below the ideal pattern by chance . In step 2 , samples from the training set are clustered using the k - NN method , where neighbors are identified by representing gene expression as vectors and placing samples according to the Euclidean distance . Each gene’s discriminative ability is considered equally regardless of its value determined by Fisher’s exact test ( i . e . , each classifier “votes” for a cohort and each vote is equal ) . After each gene evaluates the sample , the votes are summed to de - termine classification of the sample . Leave - one - out cross validation estimates the prediction error rate ( or accuracy ) by the systematic removal of one do - nor from the training set to use as a test sample . This process is repeated until all the donors have been “tested . ” A p - value ratio cutoff of 0 . 2 was used in all discrimination analyses . A p - value ratio of 0 . 2 ( equivalent to 1 / 5 ) indi - cates that the algorithm will make a prediction if the p - value ( probability that the test sample is predicted as belonging to one class by chance ) of the first best class is at least five times smaller than the p - value of the next best class . If the actual p - value ratio is less than the cutoff , a prediction will be made ; if the ratio is higher , no prediction will be made . Setting the p - value cutoff to 1 will force the algorithm to always make a prediction but may result in more prediction errors . Thus , each gene will cast a vote for each sample in the dataset if the p - value from the predicted class is at least five times smaller than the other class . Given this , it is possible to have a tie - in class prediction ( each predictor casts an equal vote ) , resulting in unclassified samples . In step 3 , an independent sample set is evaluated , as in step 2 , except for the leave - one - out cross - validation estimates . For the comparison between PBMCs and cell subtypes , Affymetrix U133A and B GeneChip raw intensity data were scaled to a target intensity value of 500 ( TGT ) in Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5 . 0 . Data were then im - ported into Genespring and analyzed without any further normalization steps . RT - PCR . RNA samples were DNase treated with TURBO DNA - free kit ( Ambion ) , and total RNA for RT - PCR analysis was further amplified due to low yields of total RNA . 5  g of each RNA sample was converted to cDNA using the High Capacity cDNA Archive kit ( Applied Biosystems ) in the PerkinElmer GeneAmp PCR System 9600 . Quantitative PCR was per - formed on selected targets using pre - developed primers and probe TaqMan Gene Expression Assays ( Applied Biosystems ) on the ABI Prism 7700 Se - quence Detection System . Expression results were calculated as the differ - ence in cycle threshold relative to the median of four healthy volunteers for each target confirmed . Online supplemental material . Fig .
