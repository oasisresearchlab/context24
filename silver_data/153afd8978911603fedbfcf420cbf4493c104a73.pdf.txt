Orchestrated by various actin binding proteins ( ABPs ) , F - actin is assembled into higher - order structures such as bundles and networks that provide mechanical support for the cell and play important roles in numerous cellular processes . Although mechanical properties of F - actin networks have been extensively studied , the underlying mechanisms for network elasticity is not fully understood , in part because different measurements probe different length and force scales . Here , we developed both passive and active microrheology techniques using optical tweezers to estimate the mechanical properties of F - actin networks at a length scale comparable to cells . For the passive approach we tracked the motion of a thermally fluctuating colloidal sphere to estimate the frequency - dependent complex shear modulus of the network . In the active approach , we used an optical trap to oscillate an embedded microsphere and monitored the response to obtain network viscoelasticity over a physiologically relevant force range . While both active and passive measurements exhibit similar results at low strain , the F - actin network subject to high strain exhibits non - linear behavior which is analogous to the strain - hardening observed in macroscale measurements . Using confocal and TIRF microscopy , we also characterize the microstructure of reconstituted F - actin networks in terms of filament length , mesh size , and degree of bundling . Finally , we propose a model of network connectivity by investigating the effect of filament length on the mechanical properties and structure .

Introduction Cells sense , generate and respond to forces in their environment through cytoskeletal dynamics , and mechanical force plays important roles in fundamental cellular processes such as migration , cytokinesis and apoptosis [ 1 - 3 ] . Actin , one of the principal constituents of the cytoskeleton , contributes to the mechanical integrity of the cell and is involved in numerous cellular functions organizing various microstructures according to functional demands [ 4 , 5 ] . Structural assembly of F - actin , critical in these processes , is regulated by over 100 actin binding proteins ( ABPs ) [ 6 , 7 ] . Two major structures of F - actin organized by ABPs are the cross - linked network and the bundled filament . For example , the ABP filamin assembles filaments into three - dimensional orthogonal networks serving as a scaffold for cell motility and signaling [ 8 , 9 ] ; in contrast , α - actinin at high concentration forms thick bundles contributing to structural stability of the cell providing added mechanical strength [ 10 , 11 ] . Therefore , an understanding of cytoskeletal mechanical properties governed by dynamic interactions between actin and ABPs is essential for understanding cell mechanics and the associated biological phenomena . Cell experiments have revealed that the cytoskeleton exhibits both elastic and viscous characteristics under applied stress [ 12 , 13 ] . Since it is difficult to accurately characterize the mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton in vivo due to active remodeling as well as the presence of numerous other , uncontrolled factors , in vitro experiments on re - constituted gels of F - actin have proven useful [ 14 - 19 ] . In vitro studies have characterized the viscoelastic properties of F - actin polymerized from purified actin in combination with various ABPs . Many of these measurements of mechanical properties have been performed using a bulk rheometer , which yields global properties of the F - actin matrix . Discrepancies have been observed , however , between these large length scale measurements and microrheometry using micron - scale beads 3 [ 20 ] . These have been attributed to a variety of factors including the non - uniform local stress field , different deformation modes [ 21 ] , the formation of a depletion zone around the microbead [ 22 , 23 ] , and other effects present when the bead is comparable in size to the characteristic dimensions of the actin mesh and individual actin filaments , both of which tend to be on the scale one to several microns [ 24 ] . While this similarity of length scales complicates interpretation of the results of microrheometry , it also provides an opportunity to probe the local mechanical response and provide insight into the specific roles of ABP in mediating rheological behavior . Other in vitro experiments have demonstrated that actin gels stiffen with increasing strain up to a point , then rapidly soften as strain is further increased [ 15 , 25 - 29 ] . Actin networks under shear deformation exhibit an irreversible non - linear behavior suggesting network remodeling and rupture of network bonds [ 26 ] . However , compressive force imposed on a dendritic actin network results in reversible stress softening suggesting that it might be caused by a different mechanism such as filament buckling [ 27 ] . The mechanisms for both the increase and sudden fall in modulus remain a subject of debate . Although models to explain these findings of actin cytoskeleton have been proposed [ 19 , 27 , 30 ] , observation of network’s response at the microscale will undoubtedly help elucidate the origin of this non - linear behavior . Here we employ both passive and active microrheology to measure mechanical properties at the microscale using optical tweezers . Optical tweezers - based microrheology provides the advantage of high - precision force control in the range of 0 . 1 ~ 100pN while simultaneously monitoring the motion of the bead with nanometer resolution [ 31 ] . Although this technique has been used to measure viscoelastic properties of fd viruses and micellar solutions [ 32 , 33 ] , its application to study F - actin networks has been limited [ 34 ] . In our passive approach , we track the motion of a thermally fluctuating microbead to estimate the frequency dependent complex 4 shear modulus of the F - actin network over a frequency range of 10 - 1 ~ 10 4 Hz . For the active approach , we apply a sinusoidal driving force to an embedded microbead and monitor its response to obtain the viscoelastic properties of the network . In particular , microscale non - linear behavior of F - actin network is demonstrated by performing the active measurement at large deformation . We investigate the effect of ABPs on the mechanical properties of F - actin networks using both passive and active techniques . To correlate mechanical properties with structural geometry , both material properties and microstructure of the cross - linked F - actin network are probed as a function of ABP concentration . Confocal microscopy and total internal reflection fluorescent ( TIRF ) microscopy are used to visualize the F - actin networks organized with filamin , α - actinin , and gelsolin . Unique features of F - actin networks polymerized with each ABP are visualized and quantified in terms of mesh size and degree of bundling . Average length of actin filaments is varied using gelsolin to investigate how the length of individual filaments alters network formation and its mechanical properties . While previous rheological measurements on entangled F - actin solutions have demonstrated that particle thermal motions are more constrained as the length of filament increases and as mesh size decreases [ 16 , 35 ] , to our knowledge , no comparable measurements have been reported in cross - linked F - actin networks . Based on our measurements , we propose a model to explain how the length of individual actin filaments influences connectivity of the cross - linked network and its elasticity . 5 2 . Materials and Methods 2 . 1 . Microspheres Amino functionalized beads ( 2 . 73 % solids , Polybead Amino Microspheres ; Polysciences , Warrington , PA ) 0 . 5 and 1  m in radius , are coated with mPEG - NHS ( 5 kDa ; Nektar , San Carlos , CA ) to prevent protein absorption as described previously [ 36 ] with the following modifications . Stock beads ( 40 μL ) are diluted with 200 μL of de - ionized water . This solution is spun down for 10 minutes at 14 , 000 rpm , supernatant is removed and the bead pellet is resuspended with 200 μL of methanol . Next , the bead solution is again centrifuged as described above , the supernatant is removed and the bead pellet is resuspended with 200 μL of 10 mg / mL PEG - NHS diluted in one part DMSO and four parts methanol . After gently mixing the bead solution for two hours at room temperature , the beads are stored at 4°C with continuous rotation to prevent aggregation by sedimentation . Beads are used within 6 months of preparation . 2 . 2 . Reconstituted in vitro F - actin networks Lyophilized actin monomers and α - actinin both from rabbit skeletal muscle are purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc ( Denver , CO ) . Activity and purity of actin are tested with sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) . Polymerized actin filaments are separated from the non - polymerized G - actin by centrifugation at 100 , 000g for 40min [ 37 ] and both supernatant and pellets are loaded on a 9 % [ wt / vol ] PAGE gel . Protein bands stained with Coomassie blue show that most of G - actin is polymerized into F - actin ( Fig . 1A ) . Protein activity is confirmed by examining the geometry of polymerized actin filaments in the micrographs ( Fig . 1B and C ) . Recombinant filamin - A is purified from Sf9 cell lysates [ 38 ] and recombinant human gelsolin is produced in Escherichia coli [ 39 ] . 6 Actin monomers are diluted in fresh G - buffer ( 5 mM Tris - HCl , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP , pH 8 . 0 ) and incubated on ice for at least two hours . Gelsolin , filamin or  - actinin are gently mixed with the actin monomer , followed by the addition of PEG - coated beads diluted in G - buffer . Actin polymerization is initiated by adding a tenth of the final volume of F - buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , 500 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM DTT , 5 mM ATP , 0 . 01 % ( w / v ) NaN 3 , pH 7 . 5 ) . The sample is gently mixed by pipetting and immediately loaded into a custom - made flow chamber , with dimensions 25 . 8 mm x 8 mm x 0 . 1 mm ( ~ 20 μL ) . Microspheres are firmly embedded in the F - actin network after several hours of polymerization . Concentrations of actin , filamin , α - actinin , and gelsolin are varied depending on the experiment . 2 . 3 . Characterizing F - actin microstructure We visualize reconstituted F - actin structures polymerized with various ABPs and characterize them in terms of mesh size and degree of filament bundling . For visualization , fluorescently labeled actin ( A - 12373 ; Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) and rhodamine phalloidin ( R415 ; Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) is used to stain actin filaments for confocal microscopy ( Axiovert 200M ; Carl Zeiss Inc . , Thornwood , NY ) and TIRF microscopy [ 40 ] , respectively . In confocal microscopy , actin filaments are labeled by polymerizing regular actin monomers in the presence of labeled monomers at a molar ratio of 5 : 1 . The sample is fixed by paraformaldehyde to minimize thermal fluctuations during image acquisition . A stack of 71 images is obtained with 100nm separation to obtain the three - dimensional ( 3D ) structure . Images are then deconvolved with HUYGENS ESSENTIAL software ( Scientific Volume Imaging , Hilversum , The Netherlands ) and assembled to construct the 3D image by IMARIS software ( Bitplane , Zurich , Switzerland ) . We characterize the mesh size of the actin networks from two - dimensional ( 2D ) plane images , instead of the projected images , in order to minimize the misinterpretation from a projection of 3D structure . 7 Mesh size of the structure is determined by two methods . Each open area bounded by actin filaments is measured and mesh diameter ( ξ ) is given by 1 / 2 ( 4 / ) Area     . Mesh size is also estimated by measuring the peak - to - peak distance in the intensity profiles of the images . Corrections to these 2D measurements for three - dimensionality of the network are made according to Overby et al [ 41 ] . 2 . 4 . Experimental setup using optical tweezers Optical tweezers - based microrheology is performed using a custom - built instrument described previously [ 40 ] . Briefly , a high numerical aperture objective ( 100X , 1 . 40 NA , oil IR ; Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) tightly focuses a 1064 - nm laser ( Coherent , Santa Clara , CA ) at the specimen plane for optical trapping . The trap location is computer - controlled with a pair of orthogonally oriented acousto - optic deflectors ( AODs ) ( Intra - Action , Bellwood , IL ) and sample positioning is controlled using a piezo - stage ( Polytech PI , Auburn , MA ) with nanometer resolution . The combination of a 975 nm laser ( Corning , Corning , NY ) and a position sensitive device ( PSD ) ( Pacific Silicon , West Lake Village , CA ) is employed for back - focal plane position detection [ 42 ] . The 975 - nm laser is operated at ~ 0 . 1 mW such that it forms a negligible trap with respect to the 1064 - nm laser operated between 5 - 100 mW . The detection zone consists of a circular area with radius of ~ 250 nm for 0 . 5 μm radius beads and ~ 500 nm for 1 . 0 μm beads . A second PSD is used to track the position of the trapping laser . The output voltages from both PSDs are collected by an A / D board ( National Instruments , Austin , TX ) and a custom program coded in LabView software ( National Instruments , Texas , NI ) is used to control experimental runs and data acquisition . Data analysis is performed using software written in MATLAB ( Mathworks , Natick , MA ) . 8 Once the sample is loaded in the sample chamber and placed on the microscope stage , single beads are located and centered in the detection zone using an automated routine . After experimental runs ( see below ) , the position of the bead is calibrated as described previously [ 43 ] . Optical tweezers were assumed to be a linear spring and the stiffness of the tweezers was characterized using free beads in buffer at different laser powers using standard calibration procedures [ 44 ] . 2 . 5 . Passive microrheology Thermal fluctuations of an embedded bead , either 0 . 5 or 1 . 0μm in radius , are recorded at 50 kHz for ~ 42 seconds using the PSD . The complex compliance of the matrix ,   f  , is computed from the power spectral density of the thermal motion using the fluctuation - dissipation theorem and the Kramers - Kronig relation [ 45 ] . The frequency - dependent complex shear modulus ,   f G , is determined by the generalized Stokes - Einstein relation ,       1 6 G f a f     , where a is the radius of the bead . The storage shear modulus ,   G f  , and loss shear modulus ,   G f  , are the real and imaginary components of   f G , respectively . We also acquire G by capturing and analyzing the time - evolution of the mean square displacement , < Δ r 2 ( t ) > , [ 46 ] . 2 . 6 . Active microrheology Sinusoidal force is applied to a microsphere embedded in the F - actin matrix by oscillating the optical tweezers using AODs . Amplitude of the sinusoidal excitation by the optical tweezers is set to ±200nm and frequency is varied from 0 . 1 to 10 Hz . Positions of both the optical tweezers and microsphere are detected by two separate PSDs simultaneously . We fit both the position of the trap , x trap , and the position of the bead , x bead , to sinusoidal functions of the form 9      ft A 2 sin , where A is amplitude , t is time , f is frequency of the input sinusoidal function and θ is the phase of each signal . The force , F ( t ) , exerted on the matrix is computed using       trap trap bead F t k x t x t       , ( 1 ) where k trap is the stiffness of the optical trap . Since deformation of the matrix is given by x bead , the frequency - dependent viscoelastic modulus is computed at a given frequency using     ( ) ( ) ( ) cos ( ( ) ) sin ( ( ) ) 6 ( ) bead F f G f G f iG f f i f ax f            , ( 2 ) where F is the force amplitude , bead x is the amplitude of the bead response and  θ is the phase delay between F ( t ) and x bead ( t ) . To impose large strain to the sample in the active measurement method , an optical tweezers is used to trap an embedded microsphere of a = 0 . 5 μm while moving the sample relative to the trap . The stage is moved sinusoidally with amplitudes of 400nm , 800nm and 1600nm at a frequency of 10Hz . We monitor the response of the microsphere and fit it to a sinusoidal function . Applied force is calculated from the distance of the microsphere from the center of the optical trap and k trap . Network displacement is determined by calculating the difference between bead and stage displacements . 10 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Microstructures of F - actin networks F - actin gels are prepared by polymerizing actin with filamin , α - actinin and gelsolin ( [ actin ] / [ gelsolin ] = 250 ) . They are visualized by confocal microscopy as described in Materials and Methods to investigate effects of cross - linking and bundling on F - actin network microstructure . For F - actin networks cross - linked with filamin , homogeneous networks are obtained over a range of the ratio of filamin to actin concentration ( R f ) between 0 . 001 and 0 . 01 at a fixed actin concentration of 10μM ( Fig . 2A ) . When R f < 0 . 0001 , F - actin networks form an inhomogeneous structure with large local variations , which is similar to the heterogeneity observed in F - actin networks cross - linked with low concentrations of heavy meromyosin [ 47 ] . When R f > 0 . 01 , the high concentration of filamin causes filament bundling and homogeneity of the network structure decreases consequently , as has also been reported in Goldmann et al [ 48 ] . F - actin networks with R f = 0 . 01 ( Fig . 2A ) exhibit nearly orthogonal branchings where actin filaments are cross - linked ( Fig . 2B ) . For F - actin organized by α - actinin , as the relative concentration of α - actinin ( R α ) to the fixed concentration of actin ( C A = 10μM ) increases , the degree of bundling increases as indicated by an increase in the relative fluorescent intensity of the filaments in confocal images ( Fig . 2C ) . While a relatively homogeneous network is observed at low concentrations ( R α < 0 . 2 ) , actin filaments form thick bundles at higher concentrations making the F - actin / α - actinin structure inhomogeneous . In the magnified image ( Fig . 2D ) for R α = 0 . 2 ( Fig . 2C ) , embedded bundles of actin filaments stand out compared to the smaller surrounding actin filaments . F - actin / filamin networks are characterized in terms of their mesh size , an important parameter in determining network mechanical properties . Mesh sizes for the homogeneous F - actin / filamin networks at both R f = 0 . 001 and R f = 0 . 01 are ~ 1μm ( Figs . 3A and 11 B ) , which is similar in value to the mesh size in a previous study of F - actin / scruin networks [ 49 ] . As expected , the mesh size of a cross - linked network is determined by the concentration of actin , and is relatively independent of the ABP concentration . In contrast , mesh size of F - actin / α - actinin networks increases with the concentration of α - actinin ( Figs . 3C and D ) . As more filament bundles are formed with increasing R α , bundling by α - actinin increases the mesh size of the F - actin network . The increase in degree of filament bundling is seen as an increase in normalized filament intensity ( Fig . 3E ) . 3 . 2 . Mechanical properties of F - actin networks Mechanical properties of the F - actin networks are estimated by passive and active methods . For C A = 10μM and R f = 0 . 01 , the frequency dependent shear modulus is estimated by the passive measurement using the compliance function ( Fig . 4A ) . At low frequency , G ' dominates over G " and approaches a constant value . At high frequency , G " > G ' and G ' scales as f 0 . 75 ( Fig . 4A ) . Active measurements were performed at low amplitude , ±200nm , for the same F - actin / filamin network . The mechanical responses of the microsphere to sinusoidal excitation have different phase delays and amplitudes depending on excitation frequency ( See Fig . 4B ) . As frequency increases , viscous dissipation increases as indicated by the large hysteresis in the curves ( Fig . 4B ) . Values for shear modulus of the F - actin network , calculated at each frequency ( Fig . 4C ) using Eq . ( 2 ) , are in good agreement with the result by passive measurement in Fig . 4A . To investigate the effects of large strain , active measurements were performed over a range of amplitudes . As the displacements increase , the response becomes non - linear as indicated by distortion of the force response ( Fig . 5A ) and the Lissajous curves ( Fig . 5B ) . However , this microscale non - linear behavior is weak compared to the significant increase of modulus by strain - hardening observed in the bulk measurements [ 15 , 19 ] . In all other measurements of the 12 mechanical properties , we set the excitation amplitude at a low level ( ±200nm ) to avoid nonlinear effects . The effect on mechanical properties of cross - linking with filamin was studied both actively and passively at C A = 10μM . As filamin concentration is increased from R f = 0 . 01 to 0 . 04 , both G ' and G″ increase over the entire frequency range ( Fig . 6A ) . Elastic effects become more dominant ; relaxation frequency of the network ( f r ) , defined as the frequency when G ' ( f r ) = G″ ( f r ) , increases 23 fold as R f increases four times . Complex shear moduli obtained by active and passive measurements are similar ( Fig . 6B ) . The plateau storage shear modulus , G 0 , estimated as that at the minimum value in G″ over the range of frequencies tested , also increases 14 fold as R f increases . 3 . 3 . Effect of filament length on network elasticity and structure We next investigated the effect of mean filament length on mechanical properties and microstructure of the cross - linked F - actin networks polymerized at C A = 10μM , R f = 0 . 01 and in the presence and absence of gelsolin to regulate filament length . In the addition of gelsolin , the molar ratio of gelsolin to actin was 1 : 1000 . To quantify the effect of gelsolin on filament length , we visualized single actin filaments polymerized in the presence and absence of gelsolin . While some long filaments are observed in the TIRF image for the actin polymerized in the absence of gelsolin ( Fig . 7A ) , the addition of gelsolin decreases the lengths of the filaments significantly ( Fig . 7B ) . Measurements from such micrographs show the average filament length to be 8 . 2 ± 5 . 2 μm and 2 . 2 ± 1 . 4 μm for the actin filaments polymerized in the absence and presence of gelsolin , respectively ( Figs . 7C and D ) . Cross - linked F - actin networks organized by actin filaments with different average lengths were also visualized . TIRF images show that actin filaments in networks polymerized without gelsolin ( Fig . 8A ) are much longer than those in 13 networks polymerized with gelsolin ( Fig . 8B ) . In the confocal images too , long filaments are observed only in the network without gelsolin ( Fig . 8C ) . Mesh sizes in the network appear to be independent of gelsolin , and therefore , independent of the length of the actin filaments forming the network ( Figs . 8E and F ) . However , both G′ and G″ measured passively decrease as the length of actin filaments decreases ( Fig . 8G ) . Plateau values seen in the MSD curves ( inset in Fig . 8G ) suggest that greater steric and elastic constraints are imposed in networks polymerized with longer actin filaments . The relaxation times ( = f r - 1 ) are approximately 0 . 2 sec for both short - and long - filament networks . Mechanical properties measured by the active method exhibit similar behavior having comparable values of both G 0 and f r ( Fig . 8H ) . Networks were also probed using microspheres with a = 1 μm . With the large microspheres as well , both G′ and G″ measured by the active method agrees well with corresponding values obtained with passive rheology . Agreement between the two methods does not depend on the average length of filaments as compared in Figs . 9A ( no gelsolin ) and 9B ( with gelsolin ) . Relaxation times for both networks are similar , ~ 1 sec , but larger than the 0 . 2 sec relaxation time found in measurements with the smaller microsphere , a = 0 . 5μm . G 0 decreases as the average length of actin filament decrease ( Fig . 9C ) . Although there is a discrepancy in G 0 between measurements made with a = 0 . 5 μm and a = 1 μm , G 0 of the network without gelsolin is higher than that with gelsolin indicating that , when the network is formed by long filaments , fluctuations of the embedded microsphere are more confined . 14 4 . Discussion In these experiments , we investigated the effects of actin filament length , method of measurement ( active vs . passive and small vs . large probe ) , degree of cross - linking , and strain amplitude on the frequency - dependent shear moduli of reconstituted actin gels using a carefully characterized system . Other studies have typically reported the effects of these parameters individually , and few have studied the effect of filament length and strain - dependent rheology at the microscale . In addition , because minor differences in experimental protocol can lead to significant effects on measured moduli , we felt that it would be useful to have one complete set of measurements examining these multiple effects in a single system under tight control . Passive and active microrheology produce similar results for F - actin networks , provided the strains are small and in the linear regime . We employed two complementary methods to measure gel microrheology . In the passive approach , frequency – dependent complex modulus was obtained over four decades in frequency by tracking thermal fluctuations of microspheres embedded in F - actin networks . The F - actin networks exhibit a plateau modulus ( G 0 ) and a low G ″ indicative of solid - like behavior at low frequencies . However , at high frequencies , G′ exhibits a significantly greater frequency - dependence compared to the weak power law observed in cells [ 13 , 50 ] . In active measurements , the complex shear modulus is estimated by monitoring the mechanical response to the external force imposed by optical tweezers . Previous studies showed that actin and myosin networks exhibit different viscoelastic responses when measured by the active method compared to the passive method , which was attributed to tension in the filaments induced by myosin [ 34 ] . Since our system lacks motor proteins and applied strains are small and in the linear response range , the active and passive results show good agreement for our cross - linked F - actin networks . To a varying degree depending on measurement methods , the 15 mechanical moduli ( G′ and G ″ ) of the in vitro F - actin networks tend to be smaller than those obtained from some measurements of living cells [ 12 , 13 , 51 ] . This difference has been attributed to the internal stresses in living cells arising from acto - myosin contraction , external adhesion , and potentially to the complexity of the cytoskeletal structure with the wide variety of ABPs found in a cell [ 34 , 51 ] . It is also important to note that our approaches are limited in that they probe local mechanical properties by monitoring the motion of a single particle . Single particle microrheology can be sensitive to the local environment of the embedded particle and the degree to which the particle is coupled to the matrix . Two - point microrheology overcomes these limitations by measuring the correlated motion of two particles [ 52 ] . As the length scale in the correlated motion is much larger than the size of the particle , two - point microrheology better reflects the bulk mechanical properties . Employing the active measurement method , we are able to observe the microscale non - linear behavior of a cross - linked F - actin network . When loading amplitude is increased , in the present experiment by increasing the amplitude of stage oscillation , the force response of an F - actin network becomes non - linear resulting in a distortion of the Lissajous figures ( Fig . 5B ) . This strain - dependent non - linear behavior at the microscale is qualitatively analogous to the mechanical properties of reconstituted actin gels under prestress probed at the macroscale [ 15 , 26 , 27 ] in that G′ is observed to increase as the bead amplitude increases . However , the non - linearity observed in the present measurements is considerably smaller . The difference can be attributed to several factors . It should be noted that the strain and stress estimated here are not the differential values which has been measured in the macroscopic measurement with prestress using a rheometer [ 15 ] , but rather , the total amounts in response to progressively larger sinusoidal oscillations of the bead . Also , in the macroscopic measurements , applied shear stress 16 produces a non - affine deformation of the cross - linked F - actin network [ 53 , 54 ] inducing extension in some actin filaments and compression in others . As the thermal undulation in the stretched filaments is reduced , network elastic modulus increases . By contrast , in our microscale measurements , local excitation using a probe particle deforms only nearby filaments within a characteristic distance comparable to the size of the probe particle . While the macroscale method estimates global properties by measuring the response of the entire network , active microrheology probes local , microscale mechanical properties at force levels in the physiological range . Therefore , our techniques can be applied to probe the characteristics of individual cross - links as studied in single molecule assays [ 55 ] . Further study of strain - dependent microrheology for F - actin networks cross - linked with other ABPs will provide a better understanding of the microscopic origin of non - linear behavior in the F - actin networks . The effects of ABP concentration are similar at the microscale to previous macroscale measurements . As filamin concentration increases for a given concentration of actin , G 0 increases 14 times as R increases four times . This is approximately consistent with previous macroscale studies showing a scaling of G 0 ~ R β , with typical exponent , β from 0 . 4 to 2 depending on the ABP used [ 17 , 18 , 49 ] . For example , a short and rigid ABP , scruin , has a scaling exponent of 2 and heavy meromyosin ( HMM ) follows the scaling G 0 ~ R 1 . 2 . As the dependence of G 0 on R reflects the molecular characteristics of the ABP ( e . g . , molecular structure , binding affinity and degree of dimerization [ 18 ] ) , filamin would appear to behave in a manner more similar to scruin than to HMM . It should be noted , however , that scaling of the modulus as a function of actin binding protein varies depending on the magnitude of R [ 26 , 47 ] . For the pre - stressed and highly cross - linked actin networks , the moduli are remarkably insensitive to concentrations of actin and actin binding protein [ 15 ] . 17 Elasticity of the F - actin network is influenced by the length of actin filaments constituting the network . Gelsolin , a severing and capping protein , was used to regulate the contour length of actin filaments [ 56 ] and mechanical properties of the network polymerized in the absence and presence of gelsolin were compared ( Fig . 8 ) . In vitro , F - actin polymerizes to contour lengths , L , of about 2 - 70  m with a mean length of 20μm [ 57 ] and the average length of actin filaments can be adjusted by the concentration of gelsolin [ 56 ] . The gelsolin concentration used in these experiments regulates L to be 2μm , consistent with Janmey et al [ 56 ] . The G o of cross - linked F - actin networks formed in the absence of gelsolin is higher than that in the presence of gelsolin , similar to the behavior seen with entangled F - actin solutions [ 16 , 20 ] . However , the effect on G 0 of gelsolin is smaller for cross - linked F - actin networks than for entangled F - actin solutions . While the elastic response of F - actin solutions is dominated by the entanglement length , L e , the elasticity of an F - actin network is determined by the distance between cross - link points , L c . Assuming affine deformations , the plateau storage shear modulus G 0 of a cross - linked F - actin network can be described by [ 58 ] 2 2 3 0 ~ c G L kT     , ( 3 ) where  is the mesh size , κ is the bending modulus of actin filament , k is Boltzmann’s constant , and T is the absolute temperature . If the networks with filamin are mostly cross - linked with negligible bundling , κ  and  should not change with filament length as confirmed by our confocal images ( Fig . 2 ) and their characterizations ( Fig . 3 ) . L c in Eq . 3 is determined by the concentration of cross - linking protein [ 17 ] . We note , however , that Eq . 3 does not account for the effects of filament length . When the actin filament length is much larger than the mesh size , most ABPs cross - link filaments at the intersection points forming a well - defined highly interconnected network . In contrast , if the length of actin filaments is comparable to or only 18 slightly greater than the mesh size , many loose ends exist , which contribute little to the overall stiffness of the network . ( Imagine the filaments of Fig . 10 ( A ) being cut at random locations . ) . Reducing the length of individual filaments leads to more loose ends in the network configuration thereby altering network connectivity . The resulting effect is a network that is less capable of withstanding stress , and therefore exhibits a smaller modulus . Our findings therefore suggest that the mechanical response of cross - linked actin networks to external force is affected by filament length , which affects network connectivity , as well as L c . Network connectivity can be investigated by visualizing cross - linking proteins as well as actin filaments . We tried to obtain the images of cross - linkers in a 3D actin network using filamin conjugated with fluorescent dye . However , it was difficult to identify individual cross - linking proteins because of the high background signal and thermal fluctuations of actin network that prevented us from obtaining clear images . The size of the probe particle also has an effect on measured network viscoelasticity . To further investigate the effects of characteristic length scales in F - actin network microrheology , mechanical properties of F - actin network were probed using a larger microsphere ( a = 1 μm ) and the results compared to those obtained with the smaller one ( a = 0 . 5 μm ) . G 0 of the network with L = 20 μm is consistently higher than that with L = 2 μm , however , values of G 0 are approximately 2 ~ 3 fold lower when measured using the larger microsphere as compared to the smaller one ( Fig . 9C ) . That is , the elastic modulus of the F - actin network probed by the tracer whose diameter is comparable to the length of actin filaments ( and mesh size ) is smaller than that measured by the probe tracer which is much smaller than the filament length . Interestingly , a significant transition in G 0 has been observed in entangled F - actin solutions when the average length of actin filaments is close to the diameter of the microsphere used in the measurements 19 [ 16 , 20 ] , which could , in both cases , be attributable to a local depletion zone created in the vicinity of a probe tracer . In network formation , long actin filaments are depleted from the immediate vicinity of the microsphere through a combination of their high bending stiffness and steric exclusion . Therefore , the microsphere resides in an environment that is more viscous than elastic leading to a reduced G′ but having little impact on G″ . This is reflected in the observation that the larger microsphere exhibits a smaller relaxation frequency ( f r ) at which G′ = G″ . Also the larger microsphere exhibits a scaling G″ ~ f 0 . 85 at high frequency indicating that the local environment behaves in a manner more reminiscent of a Newtonian fluid as compared to the scaling G″ ~ f 0 . 75 observed with a = 0 . 5 μm and L = 20 μm . 5 . Conclusions We employed methods of passive and active microrheology using optical tweezers and observed the mechanical properties of homogeneous F - actin networks . The microscale non - linear behavior of the cross - linked F - actin network was obtained by active measurement at high strain . The effects of length scale on both network elasticity and microstructure were investigated by controlling actin filament length and probe size . We showed that short actin filaments influence connectivity of the network structure resulting in a reduced elasticity . The results presented here and future similar studies with different actin - binding proteins will provide insight into the microscopic origin of mechanical properties in cross - linked F - actin networks .

Schematic illustrations of F - actin network organized by long ( A ) and short ( B ) actin filaments at identical concentrations of actin filaments and cross - linkers . In the network with long filaments ( A ) , most filaments are attached at each crossing point by ABPs that are arranged regularly along the filaments . In contrast , the network with short filaments ( B ) forms incomplete loops with many loose ends , and their arrangement is random compared to the network in ( A ) . This difference in structure would cause the network with short filaments to be less stiff than the one with long filaments . 26 Figures Fig . 1 50 kDa 40 kDa 60 kDa A B C 1 2 3 4 ~ 6nm 27 R α = 0 . 2 Fig . 2 A D R f = 0 . 01 R f = 0 . 001 B R α = 0 . 1 C R α = 0 . 5 28 Fig . 3 A B C D E R f = 0 . 001 ξ ( area ) = 1 . 04 ± 0 . 67 μm ξ ( peak ) = 0 . 83 ± 0 . 64 μm R f = 0 . 01 ξ ( area ) = 0 . 97 ± 0 . 80 μm ξ ( peak ) = 0 . 82 ± 0 . 52 μm R α = 0 . 1 ξ ( area ) = 1 . 25 ± 1 . 04 μm ξ ( peak ) = 1 . 11 ± 0 . 46 μm R α = 0 . 2 ξ ( area ) = 1 . 34 ± 0 . 77 μm ξ ( peak ) = 1 . 17 ± 0 . 53 μm 29 Fig . 4 A C 10 Hz 5 Hz 1 Hz 0 . 5 Hz 0 . 1 Hz B 30 Fig . 5 A B 31 Fig . 6 A B R f = 0 . 01 ( open ) R f = 0 . 04 ( closed ) R f = 0 . 01 ( open ) R f = 0 . 04 ( closed ) 32 A B D C Fig . 7 w / o gelsolin w / gelsolin 33 Fig . 8 A B C D F G H ξ ( area ) = 1 . 20 ± 1 . 08 μm ξ ( peak ) = 1 . 08 ± 0 . 60 μm ξ ( area ) = 1 . 13 ± 0 . 83 μm ξ ( peak ) = 1 . 02 ± 0 . 50 μm E w / o gelsolin ( open ) w / gelsolin ( closed ) w / o gelsolin ( open ) w / gelsolin ( closed ) 34 Fig . 9 A B C A w / o gelsolin w / gelsolin a = 1 . 0 μm ( dotted ) a = 0 . 5 μm ( solid ) 35 Fig . 10 A B
