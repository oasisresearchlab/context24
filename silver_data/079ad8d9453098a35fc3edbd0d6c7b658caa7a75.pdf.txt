Using genome - edited cell lines , we demonstrate that inhibition 30 of post - squalene cholesterol biosynthesis as observed in inborn errors of cholesterol 31 metabolism , results in striking immobilization of CME and impaired transferrin uptake . Imaging 32 of membrane bending dynamics and CME pit ultrastructure revealed prolonged clathrin pit 33 lifetimes and accumulation of shallow clathrin - coated structures that scaled with diminishing 34 sterol abundance . Moreover , fibroblasts derived from Smith - Lemli - Opitz syndrome subjects 35 displayed reduced CME function . We conclude that sterols lower the energetic costs of 36 membrane bending during pit formation and vesicular scission during CME and suggest 37 reduced CME contributes to cellular phenotypes observed within disorders of cholesterol 38 metabolism . 39 3 INTRODUCTION 40 Lipid composition is critical to the biophysical properties of membrane bilayers , permitting 41 maintenance of essential cellular functions such as membrane trafficking and signal 42 transduction ( Kusumi et al . , 2012 ; Raghunathan and Kenworthy , 2018 ) . Cholesterol has long 43 been recognized as a major regulator of lipid organization . Its unique structure influences lipid 44 packing , protein localization and interactions , and global membrane properties including 45 permeability , fluidity , and rigidity ( Maxfield and Tabas , 2005 ) . Synthesized de novo in the 46 endoplasmic reticulum or derived from circulating low - density lipoproteins , unesterified 47 cholesterol is distributed heterogeneously amongst various cell membranes , being 48 predominately enriched at the plasma membrane ( PM ) where it accounts for up to 45 % of the 49 total lipids present ( Das et al . , 2013 ) and 60 - 90 % of total cellular cholesterol ( de Duve 1971 ; 50 Lange et al . , 1989 ) . The importance of cholesterol composition to PM structure and function is 51 reflected in the tight regulation of intracellular transport and highly coordinated synthetic and 52 efflux mechanisms maintaining physiologic cholesterol levels ( Luo et al . , 2019 ; Mitsche et al . , 53 2015 ; Nohturfft et al . , 1998 ; Sun et al . , 2005 ; Tontonoz and Mangelsdorf , 2003 ; Vedhachalam et 54 al . , 2007 ) . 55 Membrane properties including rigidity and tension are especially pertinent to highly dynamic 56 membrane remodeling processes , such as endocytosis ( Hassinger et al . , 2017 ) . As the major 57 pathway regulating receptor - mediated signaling , clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) mediates 58 nutrient uptake , signal transduction , receptor recycling and desensitization , membrane 59 homeostasis , and developmental regulation ( Kaksonen and Roux , 2018 ) . Evidence for 60 cholesterol’s role in CME has been demonstrated by acute stripping of membrane cholesterol 61 using methyl - beta - cyclodextrin ( M β CD ) ( Rodal et al . , 1999 ; Subtil et al . , 1999 ) . Although M β CD 62 is a relatively non - specific means of cholesterol extraction contingent upon the carrier’s 63 4 hydrophobic cavity ( Zidovetzki and Levitan , 2007 ) , these classic experiments suggest a strong 64 defect in clathrin - coated pit budding and internalization upon M β CD treatment . 65 Amidst the extensive CME machinery described to date , the influence of cholesterol on plasma 66 membrane architecture may be overlooked as an active component within assembly , curvature 67 generation , and scission of clathrin - coated pits . CME is initiated by the recruitment of clathrin 68 triskelia by adapter and accessory proteins to sites of phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate 69 ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) enriched PM ( Cocucci et al . , 2012 ) . This assembly process may be sensitive to 70 alterations of lipid packing or shielding of charges secondary to cholesterol availability ( Hirama 71 et al . , 2017 ) . Progression of the PM from flat to highly curved clathrin - coated vesicles also 72 requires overcoming stiffness of the membrane and tension generated by lateral membrane 73 recruitment and opposed by membrane - cytoskeletal adhesions ( Bucher et al . , 2018 ; Scott et al . , 74 2018 ) . Recruitment of epsin NH2 - terminal homology ( ENTH ) , AP180 N - terminal homology 75 ( ANTH ) and later Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs ( BAR ) domain containing proteins likely contribute to the 76 energy required for membrane bending ( Liu et al . , 2009 ; McMahon and Gallop , 2005 ; Miller et 77 al . , 2015 ) . By interacting with these curvature effectors and stabilizing positive PM fluctuations , 78 the clathrin lattice is thought to act as a Brownian ratchet promoting curvature formation ( Liu et 79 al . , 2009 ) . This remodeling process creates energetically unfavorable membrane stress which 80 may be alleviated by cholesterol through rapid transbilayer redistribution ( Bruckner et al . , 2009 ) . 81 During vesicular scission , an energetically costly constriction requiring steep membrane 82 curvature must be achieved . The GTPase dynamin catalyzes this event by polymerizing into a 83 helical coat and constricting the endocytic pit neck by GTP hydrolysis and removal of dynamin 84 subunits . However , previous work has demonstrated constriction alone is insufficient for 85 scission to occur ( Danino et al . , 2004 ; Roux et al . , 2006 ) . Considering the severity of membrane 86 bending at these sites , the mechanical properties of the PM immediately adjacent to the 87 dynamin coat , including tension and bending rigidity , are thought to influence scission ( Morlot et 88 5 al . , 2012 ) . Bursts of actin polymerization also aid in overcoming resistance to membrane 89 bending by providing additional force leading to vesicle internalization and scission ( Collins et 90 al . , 2011 ; Grassart et al . , 2014 ) , especially in areas of high membrane tension ( Boulant et al . , 91 2011 ) . 92 Human diseases associated with disruption of cholesterol homeostasis may provide insight into 93 the lipid - specific requirements of CME , and conversely , find application from an understanding 94 of cellular trafficking within these disease states . The best characterized of these orphan 95 diseases , Smith - Lemli - Opitz syndrome ( SLOS ) , is caused by genetic mutations within the post - 96 squalene cholesterol synthesis enzyme 3 β - hydroxy - steroid - △ 7 - reductase ( DHCR7 ) ( Wassif et 97 al . , 1998 ) and presents clinically with multiple congenital malformations including distinctive 98 facial features , cardiac defects , genitourinary abnormalities , syndactyly , gastrointestinal 99 intolerance , and profound CNS dysfunction ( Smith et al . , 1964 ) . Clinical severity generally 100 correlates inversely with residual enzymatic activity ; however , significant phenotypic variability 101 exists even amongst similar pathogenic variants ( Cunniff et al . , 1997 ; Wassif et al . , 2005 ; 102 Waterham and Hennekam , 2012 ) , which ranges on a wide continuum from mild cognitive 103 impairment to embryonic lethality ( Tint et al . , 1995 ) . The relative contribution of cholesterol 104 depletion and / or accumulation of sterol precursors such as 7 - dehydrocholesterol ( 7DHC ) to 105 disease pathogenesis also remains an open question ( Wassif et al . , 2017 ) . To date , membrane 106 defects within SLOS have primarily been attributed to disruption of lipid rafts ( Gou - Fabregas et 107 al . , 2016 ; Keller et al . , 2004 ) . As a theory to explain membrane heterogeneity , the propensity for 108 cholesterol to tightly pack sphingomyelin and less saturated phospholipids underlies the basis 109 for liquid - ordered ( L o ) and liquid - disordered ( L d ) phase separation . As such , cholesterol 110 depletion is often considered evidence for lipid raft involvement . Nevertheless , consideration of 111 global effects on plasma membrane architecture is warranted , which may perturb processes 112 that are themselves independent of lipid rafts ( Kwik et al . , 2003 ; Sengupta et al . , 2007 ; van 113 6 Rheenen et al . , 2005 ) . While sterols may influence developmental pathways through a variety of 114 mechanisms , one hypothesis suggests that SLOS pathogenesis manifests in a highly temporal 115 and tissue specific context , driven by changes in signal transduction pathways ( Tulenko et al . , 116 2006 ) . Thus , defining the effects of disrupted sterol synthesis on the major pathway regulating 117 receptor - mediated signaling may also provide insight into the molecular and cellular basis for 118 the physiologic manifestations within these rare diseases . 119 In this study , we demonstrate that multiple stages of membrane remodeling during CME 120 progression are sensitive to sterol - dependent membrane properties . Clathrin pit ultrastructure 121 with cholesterol depletion exhibited asymmetric distorted structures , consistent with aberrant 122 membrane bending trajectories , suggesting that clathrin lattice assembly competes with the 123 elevated free energy costs of bending . Using sterol substitution strategies , we further 124 demonstrate that a small , C3 polar headgroup and B - ring conformation constitute structural 125 requirements for supporting efficient CME . Finally , we present evidence for disruption of CME 126 dynamics within SLOS and conclude that sterol abundance lowers the energetic barrier for 127 curvature generation during initiation of membrane bending and formation of the vesicle neck 128 during clathrin - mediated endocytosis . 129 RESULTS 130 Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is inhibited by altered cholesterol homeostasis 131 To test the hypothesis that sterol homeostasis contributes to efficient CME , we evaluated CME 132 during acute cholesterol depletion and perturbations of cholesterol synthesis in HEK293T cells . 133 Endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis was induced by culturing cells in media containing 7 . 5 % 134 lipoprotein - deficient fetal bovine serum ( LPDS ) . We used multiple targeting strategies to 135 delineate the effects of cholesterol depletion versus terminal cholesterol precursor accumulation 136 within the competing Bloch and Kandutsch - Russell ( KR ) pathways ( Figure 1A ) . AY9944 137 7 dihydrochloride , a potent inhibitor of DHCR7 ( Δ 7 - sterol reductase ) ( Fernandez et al . , 2005 ; 138 Gaoua et al . , 1999 ; Rahier and Taton , 1996 ) , has been used extensively to recapitulate the 139 biochemical hallmarks of SLOS both in vitro and in vivo ( Francis et al . , 2016 ; Kolf - Clauw et al . , 140 1996 ) . U18666A , a potent noncompetitive inhibitor of DHCR24 , was used to inhibit the final step 141 in the Bloch pathway at nanomolar concentrations where it does not perturb cholesterol 142 trafficking ( Cenedella , 2009 ; Lu et al . , 2015 ) . Comparison of AY9944 ( KR targeting ) with 143 U18666A ( Bloch targeting ) also provided access to structure - activity relationships . Specifically , 144 DHCR7 mediated reduction of the C ( 7 - 8 ) double bond confers the linear cholesterol ring 145 structure ( Serfis et al . , 2001 ) , such that treatment with AY9944 leads to accumulation of non - 146 planar sterols . Conversely , inhibition of DHCR24 leads to accumulation of sterols with more 147 rigidity as it prevents the DHCR24 mediated reduction of C ( 24 - 25 ) ( Chen and Tripp , 2012 ) . The 148 HMG - CoA reductase inhibitor Atorvastatin was used to inhibit synthesis of cholesterol and other 149 biosynthetic intermediates , while M β CD was used to acutely deplete sterols from the plasma 150 membrane ( Rodal et al . , 1999 ; Subtil et al . , 1999 ) . In this study , sterol content in HEK293T cells 151 relative to LPDS controls was raised ~ 25 % when cultured in FBS and reduced by ~ 50 % with 152 Atorvastatin , AY9944 , or M β CD . AY9944 treatment effectively led to the predicted accumulation 153 of 7 - dehydrocholesterol and zymostenol , while U18666A induced a mild accumulation of 154 desmosterol ( Figure 1B ) . 155 To monitor the effects of cholesterol homeostasis on CME , we used CRISPR / Cas9 gene editing 156 to fluorescently tag clathrin light chain A ( CLTA ) in HEK293T using our previously described 157 approach ( Figure S1A ) ( Anderson et al . , 2018 ; Scott et al . , 2018 ) . A pooled population of 158 genome - edited cells was enriched by FACS to create a homogenous population of CLTA mTq2 + 159 cells , thereby mitigating potential off - target effects that could arise in single cell clones ( Figure 160 S1B , C ) . Live - cell confocal microscopy taken at midsection planes revealed dynamic PM 161 budding and rapid trafficking of clathrin - mTq2 + vesicles in LPDS cultured cells . All sterol 162 8 depleted conditions , exemplified by AY9944 treatment , lead to striking immobilization of clathrin 163 vesicles at the PM despite ongoing intracellular transport ( Video 1 , panels 1 - 2 ) . Trafficking 164 deficits induced by AY9944 treatment were efficiently rescued by addition of cholesterol loaded 165 methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( M β CD - Chol ) as observed by rapid redistribution of clathrin - mTq2 + traffic 166 from the PM , indicating that plasma membrane cholesterol alone is sufficient and essential for 167 clathrin trafficking ( Video 1 , panel 3 ) . This effect was rapid , restoring CME within minutes of 168 M β CD - Chol addition and rendering mTq2 + - clathrin traffic indistinguishable from LPDS controls 169 within 1 h ( Video 1 , panel 3 ) . To exclude potential secondary effects from the lipophilic 170 properties of the cholesterol synthesis inhibitors , small molecules were administered in the 171 presence of exogenous cholesterol , thereby minimizing endogenous synthesis ( Wassif et al . , 172 2005 ) . Under these conditions , the cholesterol synthesis inhibitors did not produce clathrin 173 trafficking deficits ( Figure 1C ) . 174 To determine the extent of functional CME impairment , we used a high - content , non - biased 175 quantitation imaging assay to analyze the internalization of fluorescently - conjugated transferrin 176 ( Tfn ) across sterol depleted conditions . The degree of sterol depletion achieved with these 177 inhibitors ( Figure 1B ) , predicted the reduction in CME . Specifically , treatment with either 178 AY9944 , Atorvastatin , or M β CD reduced both sterol abundance and Tfn internalization by 179 approximately 50 % . U18666A had a smaller effect ( ~ 20 % reduction ) on both sterols and CME 180 ( Figure 1D ) . Confocal optical sections taken at midplane also confirmed the inhibition of Tfn 181 internalization ( Figure 1E ) , as seen by the loss of Tfn - 555 positive vesicles in the cytoplasm 182 and localization to the PM . Although Tfn internalization was impaired , high Tfn - 555 signal from 183 the PM suggests that the Tfn receptor also accumulated on the PM . Because CME was 184 impaired regardless of the step of cholesterol synthesis inhibition or time of cholesterol 185 depletion , we speculated that cholesterol depletion or decreased total sterol content was the 186 major mediator of this phenomenon , rather than accumulation of specific sterol precursors . 187 9 Parallel comparison of sterol profiles by GC / MS and Tfn uptake as a function of inhibitor 188 concentration demonstrated that CME activity was dependent on total sterol content ( Figure 1F , 189 G ) . 190 Recovery of CME traffic was also predicted by sterol abundance and availability . Addition of 191 M β CD - Chol following sterol depletion with AY9944 rapidly restored both mTq2 + - clathrin traffic 192 and transferrin internalization ( Figure 2B , top ) . In contrast , clathrin - mTq2 + vesicle trafficking 193 required 6 - 12 h to normalize following addition of FBS , indicating that lipoprotein - derived ( LDL ) 194 cholesterol uptake and redistribution was much slower ( Figure 2B , middle ) , likely due to 195 depressed CME - dependent LDL uptake ( Davis et al . , 1986 ) . Clathrin - mTq2 + vesicle trafficking 196 also did not recover upon removal of AY9944 and addition of LPDS within 12 h , indicating the 197 rate of CME rescue by endogenous cholesterol synthesis is much slower than either direct or 198 LDL - dependent cholesterol uptake ( Figure 2B , bottom ) . Feedback inhibition of 7DHC on the 199 synthetic pathway may also limit sterol biosynthesis ( Honda et al . , 1998 ) . Cellular sterol profiles 200 corresponded with the resumption of CME ( Figure 2C ) . Notably , incubation of AY9944 depleted 201 cells with M β CD - Chol corrected cellular sterol profiles more completely than availability of LDL - 202 derived cholesteryl esters over a 12 h period ( Figure 2C ) , suggesting greater efficacy and 203 bioavailability of cholesterol supplementation independent of endocytic traffic . These rescue 204 assays demonstrate a definitive requirement for an optimal concentration of cellular cholesterol 205 to facilitate clathrin vesicle trafficking . 206 7 - dehydrocholesterol can compensate for cholesterol in facilitating CME 207 As SLOS leads to a significant accumulation of 7DHC ( Irons et al . , 1993 ; Tint et al . , 1994 ) , we 208 wanted to directly address the ability of 7DHC to compensate for the activity of cholesterol with 209 regards to supporting CME . To this aim , rescue of aberrant clathrin trafficking following AY9944 210 treatment was evaluated by loading of cholesterol or 7DHC directly to cellular membranes using 211 10 M β CD as a water - soluble carrier . Incubation with M β CD - 7DHC efficiently rescued total sterol 212 levels back to cholesterol - replete conditions with 7DHC being the predominate form ( ~ 80 % of 213 total sterols ) ( Figure S2A ) . Addition of uncomplexed M β CD to cells already depleted of sterols 214 did not appreciably further reduce sterol levels , which may reflect diminished “free” cholesterol 215 available for M β CD exchange . Restoration of total sterol levels by either M β CD - Chol or M β CD - 216 7DHC resulted in resumed clathrin - mTq2 + trafficking ( Video 2 ) and robust Tfn internalization 217 ( Figure S2B , C ) . This finding suggests that loss of planarity within the sterol ring , due to the 218 additional double bond in 7DHC ( Serfis et al . , 2001 ) , does not impede its endocytic function at 219 the membrane . Although 7DHC has been suggested to impact other aspects of PM structure 220 including bending rigidity ( Gondre - Lewis et al . , 2006 ) and lipid packing ( Tulenko et al . , 2006 ) , 221 our results demonstrate 7DHC can compensate for cholesterol in sustaining CME activity . Thus , 222 CME appears to be sensitive to total sterol content but robust to sterol identity . 223 Altered sterol homeostasis inhibits clathrin - coated pit dynamics and membrane bending 224 Cholesterol’s multifaceted influence on PM properties likely contributes to lowering the energetic 225 cost of membrane remodeling ( Bruckner et al . , 2009 ) . Because EM studies following M β CD 226 treatment indicate arrest at preliminary stages of pit bending ( Rodal et al . , 1999 ; Subtil et al . , 227 1999 ) , sterol depletion may inhibit membrane curvature generation and recruitment of CME 228 proteins . To determine how cholesterol and sterols influence membrane bending during clathrin 229 assembly , we used polarized total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( polTIRFM ) of DiI , 230 which allows imaging of PM topography ( Aguet et al . , 2013 ; Anantharam et al . , 2010 ; Scott et 231 al . , 2018 ) . Imaging of membrane bending in polTIRFM is achieved by selective excitation of DiI - 232 labeled PM within the vertical ( P polarization ) or horizontal ( S polarization ) plane with respect to 233 the coverslip and quantified by the ratio of P / S fluorescence ( Anantharam et al . , 2010 ) . We 234 previously demonstrated that this approach can accurately measure changes in membrane 235 topography during membrane bending during CME by correlative light and electron microscopy 236 11 ( CLEM ) and atomic force microscopy ( CLAFM ) ( Scott et al . , 2018 ) . The membrane bending 237 dynamics of individual endocytic events were recorded in SK - MEL - 2 cells endogenously 238 expressing clathrin - mTq2 + and dynamin - eGFP + with DiI labeled membranes ( Video 3 ) . CME 239 dynamics of the SK - MEL - 2 cell line have been well characterized by live - cell TIRFM and 240 polTIRFM ( Doyon et al . , 2011 ; Scott et al . , 2018 ) . 241 Upon disruption of cholesterol homeostasis , total sterol content relative to LPDS culture was 242 found to be 147 ± 24 % ( FBS ) , 81 ± 7 % ( Atorvastatin ) , 82 ± 11 % ( AY9944 ) , or 34 ± 9 % ( M β CD ) 243 in SK - MEL - 2 treated cells ( data not shown ) . Under all sterol deplete conditions ( AY9944 , 244 Atorvastatin , and M β CD ) , the total number of unique , distinct clathrin assembly spots per cell 245 area over time was significantly lower relative to cells grown in complete media or LPDS 246 ( Figure 3C ) . Both moderate and severe sterol depletion led to an increase in the number of 247 persistent clathrin tracks ( > 400 s ) ( Figure 3D ) and average clathrin lifetimes per cell ( Figure 248 3F ) . Accumulation of clathrin - mTq2 + spots with sterol depletion indicated that the reduction in 249 clathrin tracks was not due to lack of clathrin assembly , but arrested CME ( Video 4 , Figure 3A ) . 250 Clathrin - mTq2 + tracks were further categorized according to detection of dynamin and P / S 251 signal . Although dynamin may contribute to early stages of clathrin - coated pit maturation ( Aguet 252 et al . , 2013 ; Srinivasan et al . , 2018 ) , it is most abundant during membrane fission . Dynamin - 253 eGFP + was visualized as a burst of accumulation immediately prior to the completion of 254 endocytosis and the disappearance of the clathrin - coated vesicle ( Figure 3B ) . Using dynamin 255 recruitment as a marker of completed CME events , we found that the number of productive 256 CME events per cell area was dramatically reduced during sterol depletion ( Figure 3E ) . When 257 CME events did occur , they exhibited longer lifetimes compared with FBS or LPDS controls 258 ( Figure 3G , Figure S3 ) . Following AY9944 treatment , the average lifespan of CME events 259 which could be observed was increased by 40 s ( 95 % CI [ 89 , 148 ] ) compared to LPDS controls 260 ( 95 % CI [ 66 , 97 ] ) . Moreover , CME lifetimes in AY9944 treated cells are underestimated by this 261 12 data due to temporal limitations in video tracking of persistent CME tracks . A detailed 262 breakdown of clathrin lifetimes under control or sterol depleted conditions is shown in Figure 263 S4 . 264 While both moderate ( AY9944 and Atorvastatin ) and severe ( M β CD ) cholesterol depletion led to 265 diminished rates of CME , we observed treatment - specific impacts on membrane curvature 266 dynamics . Cells displaying ~ 20 % reduction in total sterol content following AY9944 or 267 Atorvastatin treatment exhibited clathrin - mTq2 + spots associated with strong P / S signals , 268 indicating the presence of highly curved pits which stalled prior to acquiring bursts of dynamin 269 ( Figure 3A ) . DMN2 - eGFP + localization was delayed in both AY9944 and Atorvastatin treated 270 cells compared to LPDS controls , suggesting clathrin events inefficiently recruited dynamin and 271 many did not become productive CME events . As illustrated by kymographs of long - lived 272 clathrin tracks failing to undergo scission ( Figure S5 ) , fluctuations in P / S membrane bending 273 along clathrin tracks were noted . While weak DNM2 eGFP + signal was associated with many 274 curved clathrin structures , robust dynamin signatures could also be seen dissociating without a 275 loss of clathrin signal . No differences in dynamin lifetimes were observed in association with 276 productive CME events ( data not shown ) . These findings suggest moderate disruption of 277 cholesterol synthesis allowed membrane bending during the early stages of CME , but precluded 278 neck formation and the recruitment of dynamin . In contrast , cells displaying ~ 65 % reduction in 279 total sterols following M β CD treatment exhibited diminished P / S signals with little to no dynamin 280 recruitment ( Figure 3A , H ) , indicating that severe sterol depletion inhibits CME at the stage of 281 initial membrane bending . This result is consistent with previous studies describing flat clathrin - 282 coated structures following M β CD mediated sterol depletion , consistent with an inability of 283 clathrin - coated pits to invaginate ( Rodal et al . , 1999 ) . Altogether , these findings suggest a 284 homeostatic level of cholesterol is required at multiple stages of PM bending for the CME 285 pathway to proceed normally . 286 13 Sterol depletion inhibits curvature generation and neck formation during CME , producing 287 asymmetric pit structure 288 In order to understand the effects of sterol depletion on membrane curvature during CME , we 289 preformed platinum replica EM of unroofed SK - MEL - 2 cells to quantitatively assess 290 ultrastructure ( Sochacki et al . , 2017 ; Sochacki et al . , 2014 ) . We classified clathrin structures as 291 flat , shallow , domed , or spherical to quantitatively assess curvature status ( Figure 4B ) . In 292 cholesterol replete conditions ( FBS or LPDS culture ) , flat and spherical clathrin - coated pits were 293 most commonly observed with fewer shallow or domed structures . This observation was 294 consistent with rapid progression of CME pits from flat to spherical as previously described in 295 SK - MEL - 2 cells cultured in FBS ( Scott et al . , 2018 ) . In contrast , moderate sterol depletion with 296 either Atorvastatin or AY9944 increased the relative frequency of shallow and domed structures , 297 predominately at the expense of spherical pits ( Figure 4B ) . The increased frequency of 298 shallow / domed structures explains the high P / S signal observed on clathrin spots by polTIRFM 299 with AY9944 and Atorvastatin treatment ( Figure 3A ) . Combined with the fluctuations observed 300 in the P / S signals ( Figure S5 ) , these findings suggest that the structural transition from shallow 301 to domed morphology is metastable , potentially due to the energetics of clathrin - coat lattice 302 reorganization competing with elevated free energy costs of membrane bending upon sterol 303 depletion . Consistent with polTIRFM studies , severe sterol depletion by M β CD shifted the 304 relative frequency of coated pit curvature to predominately flat or shallow coated pits , reinforcing 305 the concept that sterol depletion from the PM dramatically increases the energetic cost of 306 membrane bending ( Figure 4A ) . Absolute values of the categorized clathrin structures per cell 307 are summarized in Figure S6 . In support of intrinsic membrane properties altering the 308 energetics of membrane bending , caveolae under cholesterol deplete conditions also exhibited 309 a flattened , disassembled morphology ( Figure 4F ) and were decreased in number at the 310 plasma membrane ( Figure 4G ) . These findings provide direct structural evidence that sterol 311 14 abundance influences the progression of CME events by altering membrane bending dynamics 312 at multiple stages of curvature generation . 313 Sterol depletion also resulted in loss of structural symmetry within pits . While most clathrin 314 structures were flat in M β CD treated cells , the few observable spherical pits were asymmetric 315 and distorted ( Figure 4D ) , suggesting aberrant energetics of membrane bending . Upon sterol 316 depletion with both AY9944 and Atorvastatin , distorted coated pits exhibiting elongated necks 317 without a narrow base were also observed ( Figure 4D inset ) and the quantified asymmetry 318 scaled with the severity of cholesterol depletion such that M β CD > > AY9944 ~ Atorvastatin 319 ( Figure 4D ) . Aside from the numerous flat clathrin structures within M β CD treatment which were 320 beginning to converge ( Figure 4E , panel 1 ) , no significant differences in the average size of 321 clathrin structures were observed across treatments within the shallow , domed , and spherical 322 subsets of curvature classification ( Figure 4E , panels 2 - 4 ) . This suggests that once energetic 323 barriers were crossed , general pit dimensions were constant . Notably , the area of the PM 324 covered by clathrin increased dramatically from approximately 1 . 5 % in FBS and LPDS controls 325 to 3 . 0 % , 4 . 0 % , and 8 . 7 % when treated with Atorvastatin , AY9944 , or M β CD , respectively 326 ( Figure 4C ) . A possible explanation for the loss of clathrin pit symmetry upon sterol depletion 327 may be due to the accumulation of stalled pits on the PM resulting in asymmetric membrane 328 bending trajectories during the remodeling of large flat clathrin lattices into vesicles ( Avinoam et 329 al . , 2015 ; Scott et al . , 2018 ) . This data demonstrates that perturbation of cholesterol 330 homeostasis alters the process of clathrin assembly and the trajectory of membrane bending 331 leading to an accumulation of normal and distorted clathrin - coated pits on the PM . 332 Phase separation predicts the sterol structural requirements for supporting CME 333 Considering that membrane bending was impacted at both early and late stages of pit formation 334 congruent upon total sterol abundance , the ability of a structurally dissimilar sterol ( 7DHC ) to 335 15 support CME , and the relative abundance of cholesterol within the PM , we wanted to further 336 define the biophysical properties of sterols necessary for facilitating curvature and CME . 337 Biophysical studies in model membranes have suggested rapid transbilayer redistribution ( flip - 338 flop ) of cholesterol relieves stress associated with membrane remodeling by alleviating the 339 molecular disparities between the inner and outer PM leaflets during bending ( Bruckner et al . , 340 2009 ; Lange et al . , 1981 ) . In contrast to other lipid components of the PM , cholesterol 341 transbilayer flip - flop occurs within milliseconds ( Choubey et al . , 2013 ; Hamilton , 2003 ; Steck et 342 al . , 2002 ) , a timescale sufficiently fast to support local membrane remodeling during an 343 endocytic event , which typically takes 80 - 100 s in the case of CME ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . 344 Additionally , cholesterol and select sterols have the capacity to partition bilayers into liquid - 345 ordered ( L o ) or liquid - disordered ( L d ) phases due to preferential tight packing of sterols and lipid 346 components . Phase separation is postulated to underlie membrane shape transitions by 347 minimizing line tension between domain boundaries ( e . g . driving progressive curvature 348 generation to neck structures ) ( Jülicher and Lipowsky , 1993 , 1996 ) and is implicated in 349 membrane curvature and budding behavior in artificial membranes ( Bacia et al . , 2005 ) . 350 To clarify the sterol structural requirements necessary to support CME , we used M β CD to 351 deliver structurally diverse sterols and tested their ability to rescue CME function following 352 AY9944 inhibition . As summarized in Figure 5A , Table S2 , sterols were chosen based on 353 differences in ring structure ( lathosterol , 7DHC ) , aliphatic tail structure ( desmosterol ) , and 354 predicted ability to phase separate or support transbilayer movement of sterols . Cholestenone , 355 which substitutes the 3 β - hydroxyl with a ketone group as typical of steroid hormones , likely 356 diminishes polar interactions at the membrane - water interface to promote more rapid interleaflet 357 exchange ( Róg et al . , 2008 ) . Conversely , increased polarity ( 4 β - hydroxycholesterol ) or charge 358 ( cholesterol sulfate ) would impede sterol exchange between membrane leaflets and do not 359 support phase separation ( Bacia et al . , 2005 ; Wenz and Barrantes , 2003 ) . Incubation with 360 16 desmosterol , 7DHC , lathosterol or 4 β - hydroxycholesterol M β CD - sterol complexes efficiently 361 rescued total sterol levels to LPDS levels ( Figure 5B ) . M β CD - cholesterol sulfate and 362 cholestenone complexes only allowed for sterol exchange ( total cellular sterol content remained 363 near AY9944 levels ) . Sterols previously demonstrated to allow for sterol flipping and supporting 364 phase separation ( desmosterol , 7DHC ) rescued Tfn internalization ( Figure 5C , D ) . However , 365 Tfn internalization was not rescued by sterols which do not support phase separation or allow 366 membrane flip - flop ( 4 β - hydroxycholesterol , galactosyl cholesterol ) ( Figure 5C , D ) . This 367 suggests that sterol structures supporting phase separation confer similar requirements 368 necessary to support CME . 369 Integrity of the actin cytoskeleton does not significantly modulate CME sterol 370 dependence 371 During CME , the polymerization energy of the clathrin lattice is opposed by membrane bending 372 energy ( Saleem et al . , 2015 ) . While the actin cytoskeleton is not absolutely required for CME in 373 mammalian cells , it becomes increasingly important as membrane tension increases 374 ( Batchelder and Yarar , 2010 ; Boulant et al . , 2011 ) . Actin polymerization is thought to provide 375 additional force during the transition of domed to spherical shaped pits in preparation for the 376 vesicle scission phase ( Grassart et al . , 2014 ) , ( Hassinger et al . , 2017 ; Skruzny et al . , 2012 ) . 377 Inhibition of CME dynamics within mitotic cells has been observed where rigid cortical actin and 378 increased membrane tension dominate ( Kaur et al . , 2014 ) . Moreover , cytoskeletal alterations 379 which occur following cholesterol depletion may enhance membrane - cytoskeletal adhesions , 380 resulting in either sequestration of actin away from CME or elevated membrane tension ( Ayee 381 and Levitan , 2016 ; Khatibzadeh et al . , 2012 ) . To determine whether inhibition of CME by sterol 382 depletion is mediated through changes to the actin cytoskeleton or specific to the membrane , 383 we depolymerized actin with latrunculin B pre - treatment during inhibition by AY9944 alone or 384 following recovery of CME activity by sterol repletion ( Figure S7C ) . We did not find evidence of 385 17 significant latrunculin B sensitivity in either restoring CME activity in sterol depleted cells or 386 inhibiting M β CD - cholesterol rescue ( Figure S7E ) . These data suggest the influence of sterols 387 on CME is largely independent of actin remodeling but directly dependent on changes to the 388 physical properties of the PM . 389 Patient fibroblasts containing mutations within cholesterol synthesis genes exhibit 390 functional CME deficits 391 To determine if CME activity was reduced within the context of a human disease characterized 392 by sterol disruption , Tfn uptake assays were performed on fibroblasts derived from SLOS 393 subjects . Three cell lines were selected to be representative of the SLOS phenotypic spectrum 394 ( Table S3 ) . Compared to an unaffected control , Tfn uptake was greatly reduced in SLOS 395 samples upon culture within LPDS conditions ( Figure 6A , D ) , responding similarly to AY9944 396 treated control fibroblasts . While CME activity was similarly inhibited in all three SLOS 397 fibroblasts when cultured in LPDS conditions , CME function correlated to the total sterol levels 398 of each cell line as determined by GC / MS ( Figure 6B ) . Notably , even under cholesterol replete 399 conditions , fibroblasts from the most biochemically severe SLOS cell lines trended towards 400 diminished Tfn internalization , suggesting that exogenous lipid supplementation and lipoprotein 401 is unable to fully rescue CME function ( Figure 6C ) . These data demonstrate a direct link 402 between sterol homeostasis and CME within SLOS subjects , while suggesting functional deficits 403 in CME may have clinical impact within this patient population . 404 DISCUSSION 405 Here , we present evidence for the role of sterols in aiding membrane curvature generation 406 during CME by direct observation of alterations in membrane - bending dynamics . Ultrastructure 407 analysis and polTIRFM of clathrin - coated pits under increasing degrees of cholesterol depletion 408 reveal domed and shallow structures respectively , supporting the model that redistribution of 409 18 sterols impacts the energetics of membrane bending during both initiation of curvature and 410 formation of the endocytic neck . We demonstrate that total sterol levels correlate with CME 411 productivity in multiple cell types , consider the structural requirements of sterols to support 412 CME , and find functional CME impairment in Smith - Lemli - Opitz patient samples , exhibiting 413 DHCR7 mutations and reduced sterol levels . 414 As the single most abundant lipid within the PM , the presence of cholesterol is critical to the 415 biophysical properties of the bilayer . Our findings suggest that cholesterol is relevant to multiple 416 stages of PM bending during an endocytic event , consistent with a structural role in alleviating 417 energetic stress associated with curvature formation . Rescue of trafficking deficits using sterol 418 substitution strategies suggest that the structural requirements for CME mirror the sterol 419 requirements for supporting L o domain formation , or minimally lipid packing capacity ( Megha et 420 al . , 2006 ; Wenz and Barrantes , 2003 ) . This is in agreement with a report by Kim , et . al . which 421 concludes that the presence of the 3 β - hydroxyl and ability of a sterol to support ordered domain 422 formation is necessary for endocytosis ( Kim et al . , 2017 ) . In our hands , desmosterol behaved 423 most similarly to cholesterol while the strongly raft promoting sterols , 7DHC and lathosterol , 424 compensated for cholesterol to a lesser degree . While this observation does not imply stable 425 PM rafts nor exclude regulation of membrane protein effectors , it is notable given a large body 426 of work implicating membrane phase separation within curved membranes ( Bacia et al . , 2005 ; 427 Bruckner et al . , 2009 ; Hilgemann et al . , 2020 ; Huttner and Zimmerberg , 2001 ; Jülicher and 428 Lipowsky , 1993 , 1996 ; Pandit et al . , 2004 ) . Budding theory originally proposed by Julicher and 429 Lipowsky ( Jülicher and Lipowsky , 1993 , 1996 ) predicts that the boundaries between L o and L d 430 domains tend to be minimized by “line tension” , such that induction of curvature progresses to 431 budding of either domain . This behavior has recently been reviewed as a driving force in other 432 clathrin - independent endocytic pathways ( Hilgemann et al . , 2020 ) and during CME ( Frey and 433 Schwarz , 2020 ) . Immediate stress relaxation due to fast sterol transbilayer flip - flop is an 434 19 underlying assumption within this model ( Jülicher and Lipowsky , 1996 ) and , moreover , rapid 435 sterol flip - flop explains how sterol structure determines curvature and budding phenomena 436 within GUVs undergoing osmotic deflation ( Bacia et al . , 2005 ) . During CME progression , a high 437 energetic cost is associated with the initiation of membrane bending and is problematic for 438 vesicle neck formation ( Lentz et al . , 2002 ) . In vitro studies in lipid monolayers demonstrate that 439 lipid distribution becomes non - uniform following bending with cholesterol concentrating to 440 regions of high curvature ( Wang et al . , 2007 ) . Interestingly , the effects of cholesterol on 441 membrane rigidity ( Henriksen et al . , 2004 ; Song and Waugh , 1993 ) would appear contradictory 442 to its observed effect in facilitating membrane curvature . Biophysical studies in artificial 443 membranes suggest cholesterol flip - flop may relax tension in L o domains despite their increased 444 stiffness ( Bacia et al . , 2005 ; Bruckner et al . , 2009 ) , explaining why lipid rafts may be preferential 445 sites for membrane budding and endocytosis ( Conner and Schmid , 2003 ; Huttner and 446 Zimmerberg , 2001 ) . Our findings suggest that sterol - mediated stress relaxation behavior 447 previously described within model membranes ( Bacia et al . , 2005 ; Bruckner et al . , 2009 ) may 448 translate to membrane remodeling in vivo . While it’s possible the relationship between sterol 449 abundance and PM curvature involves a previously unrecognized and complex lipid - sensing 450 mechanism , it seems parsimonious to consider that cholesterol passively facilitates membrane 451 remodeling through rapid transbilayer flip - flop , relieving membrane stress between the inner and 452 outer PM leaflets during pit formation to support high curvature ( Figure 7 ) . 453 In addition to modifying membrane bilayer architecture directly , sterol homeostasis may also 454 impact CME through secondary mechanisms . Membrane curvature itself may influence the 455 intrinsic activity of enzymes involved in membrane traffic ( Bozelli et al . , 2018 ) . Furthermore , 456 recruitment of curvature - sensing structural proteins may be affected , including ENTH / ANTH and 457 BAR domain proteins which further promote PM curvature through hydrophobic insertion into 458 the membrane or scaffolding mechanisms ( Haucke and Kozlov , 2018 ) . Cholesterol’s influence 459 20 on lateral packing and ordering of the local lipid environment may also disrupt PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 460 organization ( Kwik et al . , 2003 ) , which may affect association of PH domain containing CME 461 proteins . Packing of cargo is likely less affected by sterol depletion , as previous studies have 462 demonstrated that the concentration of transferrin receptor ( TfR ) increased in accordance with 463 coated pit surface area ( Rodal et al . , 1999 ) . Though not required for CME in mammalian cells , 464 actin assembles during the final stages of CME where it is thought to aid in the transition of 465 domed to spherical shaped pits and vesicle scission under conditions where membrane tension 466 is increased ( Boulant et al . , 2011 ; Hassinger et al . , 2017 ; Skruzny et al . , 2012 ) . While disruption 467 of actin integrity did not appreciably change CME responses to disruption of sterol synthesis , 468 acute cholesterol depletion with M β CD is known to lead to stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton 469 and increase membrane - cytoskeleton adhesions through micropipette aspiration and optical 470 tweezer membrane tether experiments ( Khatibzadeh et al . , 2012 ) . Given that the balance 471 between endocytosis / exocytosis and the cytoskeleton are highly coordinated through 472 membrane tension ( Diz - Munoz et al . , 2013 ) , a holistic understanding of membrane surface 473 dynamics in response to cholesterol depletion may lead to a more cohesive understanding of 474 cellular responses and those observed within SLOS ( Jiang et al . , 2010 ) . 475 As our findings favor a biophysical rather than a biochemical explanation for cholesterol’s role in 476 facilitating membrane curvature , we would predict the findings presented here for CME may 477 extend to other endocytic and membrane remodeling processes . Indeed , several other 478 endocytic pathways , including caveolar , clathrin - independent , macropinocytosis , and clathrin - 479 and caveolae / caveolin1 - independent endocytosis , are known to be sensitive to cholesterol 480 depletion ( Doherty and McMahon , 2009 ) . Within our own TEM analysis , we observed flattened 481 and disassembled caveolar structures , consistent with reports that caveolin - 1 may both sense 482 and induce membrane curvature by cholesterol clustering ( Krishna and Sengupta , 2019 ) . 483 Cholesterol also appears to be necessary for fusion pore kinetics during exocytosis as observed 484 21 in platelets ( Ge et al . , 2010 ) , chromaffin cells ( Wang et al . , 2010 ) , and neurons ( Najafinobar et 485 al . , 2016 ) . In the limited studies where endocytosis and exocytosis have been measured 486 simultaneously , sterol depletion appears to principally impair endocytosis ( Subtil et al . , 1999 ; 487 Yue and Xu , 2015 ) . Furthermore , intracellular recycling of TfR to the cell surface also appeared 488 to be unaffected , suggesting the PM may be more susceptible to sterol depletion than other 489 intracellular compartments ( Subtil et al . , 1999 ) . A plausible explanation for these phenomena 490 may lie in the transbilayer asymmetry of PM sterol distribution and directionality of sterol flux as 491 lipid gradients maintained across organelles have been proposed to provide a self - organizing 492 directionality to both the secretory and endosomal pathways ( Levental et al . , 2020 ) . 493 Our studies suggest that reduced endocytic activity may be an important contributor to the 494 cellular phenotypes observed within SLOS , potentially providing a unifying explanation for some 495 of the varied and highly tissue - specific abnormalities reported within SLOS . As endocytosis and 496 exocytosis are functionally coupled , impairment of CME may be linked to trafficking 497 abnormalities previously described within secretory granules of the pancreas , pituitary and 498 adrenal glands in Dhcr7 - / - and Sc5d - / - mouse models ( Gondre - Lewis et al . , 2006 ) . Similarly , 499 impaired endocytic traffic may lead to dysregulation of the endosomal - lysosomal pathway which 500 may be related to both aberrant Sonic Hedgehog signaling ( Blassberg and Jacob , 2017 ; 501 Blassberg et al . , 2016 ) and compromised phagosome maturation ( Futter et al . , 2012 ; 502 Ramachandra Rao et al . , 2018 ) described within SLOS models . During embryonic development , 503 CME is necessary for maintenance of pluripotency through regulation of pluripotent and 504 differentiation signals ( Narayana et al . , 2019 ) . Impaired Wnt / β - catenin and cadherin - related 505 signaling was recently identified within SLOS patient - derived stem cells which display 506 precocious differentiation ( Francis et al . , 2016 ) , suggesting a possible role for CME deficits 507 within cell fate decisions and developmental pathologies . Within the nervous system , dynamic 508 communication between neurons is highly dependent upon intact vesicular trafficking and CME 509 22 for rapid neurotransmission , receptor desensitization , dendritic spine plasticity , and myelination 510 ( Murthy and Stevens , 1998 ; Saheki and De Camilli , 2012 ; Watanabe et al . , 2014 ; Winterstein et 511 al . , 2008 ) . Interestingly , impairment of CME through DNM1 mutations causes epileptiform 512 discharges ( Dhindsa et al . , 2015 ) , a prevalent finding in SLOS individuals ( Schreiber et al . , 513 2014 ) . Rapid endocytosis is also of significant relevance to the brush boarder of small intestinal 514 enterocytes whose microvilli exhibit high curvature and are highly enriched in cholesterol 515 ( Hansen et al . , 2003 ; Huttner and Zimmerberg , 2001 ) . As such , endocytic deficits could 516 contribute to feeding difficulties and gastrointestinal intolerance commonly observed in SLOS . 517 Previous studies have also observed increased levels of Tfn protein present within the retina of 518 AY9944 - treated rats ( Tu et al . , 2013 ) and cerebrospinal fluid isolated from SLOS subjects 519 ( Cologna et al . , 2016 ) , possibly due to reduced TfR - mediated internalization . The varied and 520 complex role of cholesterol in different cellular functions indicates that malformations and 521 functional deficits observed within disorders of cholesterol synthesis could be due to competing 522 and disparate effects of the lipid . As such , the extent to which impairment of CME contributes to 523 disease pathogenesis and clinical phenotypes observed will require additional careful study . 524 Current treatment strategies for SLOS include empirical dietary cholesterol supplementation , 525 which has been shown to normalize plasma cholesterol with variable outcomes on sterol 526 precursors ( Linck et al . , 2000 ) . However , cholesterol supplementation does not universally 527 correct plasma cholesterol concentrations nor does plasma cholesterol necessarily reflect tissue 528 sterol content . Furthermore , the benefits of dietary cholesterol supplementation have been 529 modest ( Svoboda et al . , 2012 ) and longitudinal studies indicate that baseline cholesterol levels 530 are a better predictor of developmental trajectory than age of supplementation or increase in 531 cholesterol serum levels ( Sikora et al . , 2004 ) . Depressed CME activity may be linked to 532 suboptimal efficacy of cholesterol supplementation by further reducing cholesterol 533 bioavailability . Our studies indicate that once CME is effectively inhibited by AY9944 , recovery 534 23 of clathrin trafficking requires upwards of 6 - 12 hours to resume in the presence of FBS , yet 535 recovers within minutes if cholesterol is delivered directly to the PM via M β CD carrier . 536 Interesting , a secondary defect in LDL metabolism has been described within SLOS fibroblasts , 537 where decreased LDL apolipoprotein degradation products were observed ( Wassif et al . , 2002 ) . 538 While this mechanism likely involves impaired NPC1 function ( Wassif et al . , 2002 ) , it’s possible 539 that a defect in LDL internalization due to impaired CME efficiency also contributes to this effect . 540 A potential strategy to overcome impaired internalization and utilization of cholesterol in vivo 541 may be direct delivery of cholesterol via a mechanism independent of receptor - mediated 542 endocytosis , such as a cyclodextrin ( CD ) carrier . This seemingly straightforward approach could 543 preferentially target PM properties likely mediating CME impairment as well as bypass impaired 544 lysosomal function , necessary for liberation of cholesterol esters . Furthermore , our sterol 545 substitution studies indicate that cholesterol precursors are more readily mobilized by M β CD , 546 with cholesterol preferentially retained . Thus , cyclodextrin - mediated cholesterol delivery may 547 have the added benefit of aiding clearance of sterol precursors . CDs have been widely studied 548 for various applications within pharmacology ( Vecsernyes et al . , 2014 ) . Most recently “empty” 2 - 549 Hydroxypropyl - β - Cyclodextrin ( HP β CD ) received regulatory approval for treatment of Niemann - 550 Pick Type C1 , currently undergoing Phase II and III clinical trials ( Ory et al . , 2017 ) . A reversal of 551 this strategy as a cholesterol delivery mechanism in SLOS could theoretically overcome several 552 challenges hindering current cholesterol supplementation therapy . 553 In summary , we find that maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis is essential for efficient 554 clathrin mediated endocytosis , demonstrate an active role for sterols in mediating membrane 555 remodeling during this process , and provide mechanistic detail into the sterol functional 556 requirements necessary for this process . While the extent to which altered CME dynamics and 557 function contribute to the pathogenesis of disorders of cholesterol metabolism is unclear , further 558 investigation into CME’s role within these orphan disease is warranted . 559 24 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 560 This study was supported by NIH grants ( NIGMS P20 GM103620 and P20 GM103548 ) .

Curved clathrin events were classified as exhibiting positive P / S 637 curvature signal , but failed to recruit dynamin . Curved CME events were classified by the ability 638 of clathrin positive events to recruit dynamin . 639 Figure 4 .

Model of cholesterol - mediated stress relaxation during clathrin - mediated 680 endocytosis . Proposed mechanism of sterol dynamics during membrane remodeling and 681 associated energy landscape of local curvature generation during CME . As sterols influence the 682 29 tight packing of lipid bilayers , rapid cholesterol interleaflet flip - flop may relieve compression and 683 expansion of the PM leaflets to negate energy costs associated with deformation of the 684 membrane [ inset ] . This cholesterol - mediated stress relaxation reduces the energetic 685 requirements necessary for membrane remodeling . Experimental evidence presented herein 686 supports the model that cholesterol - mediated stress relaxation may facilitate initiation of 687 curvature generation as well as formation of the highly curved vesicle neck . Tight lipid packing 688 of sterols , thought to underlie formation of L o and L d domains ( e . g . lipid rafts ) , may serve a 689 driving force for membrane budding as increasing curvature minimizes line tension between 690 phase boundaries . 691 30 MATERIALS AND METHODS 692 Cell culture . HEK293T ( parental and hCLTA EN - Tq2 ) and human SK - MEL - 2 ( hCLTA EN - Tq2 693 hDNM2 EN - eGFP , as previously described ( Scott et al . , 2018 ) ) were maintained in DMEM ( Gibco , 694 4 . 5 g / L glucose , 110 mg / L pyruvate ) , supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) FBS ( Hyclone ) , and 1 , 000 695 U / mL penicillin / streptomycin . For inhibition of cholesterol synthesis , cells were rinsed twice in 696 serum - free DMEM and cultured under cholesterol deplete conditions in 7 . 5 % delipidated serum 697 ( LPDS ) for 48 h with small molecule inhibitors AY9944 ( 2 . 5 µM , Cayman Chemical ; DHCR7 698 inhibitor ) , U18666A ( 20 nM , Cayman Chemical ; DHCR24 inhibitor ) , Atorvastatin ( 1 µM , Cayman 699 Chemical ) , or Simvastatin ( Cayman Chemical ) , or at concentrations as otherwise specified . 700 Acute sterol depletion was achieved by 1 h incubation with 5 mM M β CD ( Alfa Aesar , 1303 . 31 701 g / mol ) at 37°C . De - identified fibroblasts cultured from skin punch biopsies from Smith - Lemli - 702 Opitz subjects ( kind gift from Dr . Forbes Porter , NICHD ) were maintained in DMEM ( Gibco , 4 . 5 703 g / L glucose , 110 mg / L pyruvate ) , supplemented with 15 % ( v / v ) FBS ( Hyclone ) , and 1 , 000 U / mL 704 penicillin / streptomycin . SLOS fibroblasts were rinsed twice in serum - free DMEM and cultured 705 for 10 days in 7 . 5 % ( v / v ) LPDS to induce biochemical profiles . 706 CRISPR / Cas9 gene editing of clathrin light chain . C’ terminal targeting of the CLTA gene to 707 enable fluorescence tracking with mTuroquise2 ( mTq2 ) was performed using a homology - 708 directed repair strategy as previously described ( Anderson et al . , 2018 ; Scott et al . , 2018 ) . 709 Briefly , a guide RNA ( 5’ - GCAGATGTAGTGTTTCCACA - 3’ ) targeting the open reading frame in 710 the immediate vicinity of the stop codon was cloned into the Cas9 expression vector pX330 - U6 - 711 Chimeric _ BB - CBh - hSpCas9 ( gift from Feng Zhang ( Cong et al . , 2013 ) , Addgene plasmid 712 # 42230 ) . The donor vector consisted of 1 kB homology arms flanking a cassette containing 713 puromycin N - acetyl - transferase expressed in - frame with CLTA and Tq2 via the self - cleavable 714 peptide sequence P2A . 1 x 10 6 HEK293T cells were transfected with 4 µg donor and 2 . 5 µg 715 pX330 Cas9 plasmid ( CalPhos TM Mammalian Transfection kit , Clontech ) . After 72 h , Tq2 716 31 positive cells were isolated with a FACSJazz Cell Sorter ( BD Biosciences ) and characterized as 717 described previously ( Figure S1 ) ( Anderson et al . , 2018 ) . 718 Preparation of delipidated serum . To facilitate cell culture under defined lipid conditions , fetal 719 bovine serum ( FBS ) devoid of sterols , triglycerides , and other neutral lipids was prepared based 720 on previously described techniques ( Cham and Knowles , 1976 ) . To prevent oxidation due to 721 trace peroxides , 0 . 1 mg ethylenediamine tetraacetate ( EDTA ) was added per 50 mL FBS . 722 Serum was mixed 1 : 2 with organic phase ( consisting of 3 : 2 ratio diisopropyl ether : n - butanol ) 723 followed by vigorous stirring for 1 h protected from light . After centrifugation at 4°C for 15 min at 724 2200 rpm , the aqueous layer was collected and lyophilized . Following resuspension in 725 molecular grade H 2 O , ITS - G supplement ( Invitrogen ) was added , the solution filter - sterilized , 726 and stored at - 20°C . GC / MS analysis indicated nearly undetectable cholesterol levels . 727 Delipidated serum ( LPDS ) was substituted for regular FBS to stimulate expression of de novo 728 cholesterol biosynthesis . 729 Sterol loading of M β CD . Methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( M β CD ) - cholesterol complex commercially 730 available ( Sigma , C4951 ) . For M β CD - sterol complexation , 50 mg / mL sterol stocks in 1 : 1 731 chloroform : methanol were prepared for desmosterol , lathosterol , cholestenone , cholesterol 732 sulfate , 4 β - hydroxycholesterol ( Avanti Polar Lipids ) , 7DHC and cholesterol ( Sigma or Avanti 733 Polar Lipids ) . Stoichiometry of M β CD - cholesterol complexes typically consists of one 734 cholesterol molecule entrapped within two CDs ( 1 : 2 molar ratio ) . We found optimal loading 735 conditions using a 1 : 7 molar ratio , where desired sterol concentration was dried under nitrogen 736 flow , followed by addition of 5 mM M β CD ( Alfa Aesar , 1303 . 31 g / mol ) prepared in serum - free 737 DMEM . Sterol suspensions were sonicated for 5 min and incubated at 37°C with agitation 738 overnight . Sterol crystals were subsequently removed via 0 . 45 µm filtration . Sterol loading 739 rescue experiments were performed by incubation for 1 h at 37°C supplemented with 0 . 5 % 740 32 BSA , followed by removal and addition of 7 . 5 % LPDS for imaging or subsequent analysis to 741 limit prolonged exposure to M β CD . 742 GC / MS sterol analysis . Cell pellets flash frozen on dry ice were reconstituted in 1 mL of water 743 and lysed by successive freeze / thaw cycles in a 50 ° C bead bath . 50 µL per sample was 744 removed for protein quantification ( MicroBCA Protein Assay , Pierce Biotechnology ) . 1 mL 745 saponification buffer containing 7 % KOH in 92 % ethanol with 10 ug / mL coprostan - 3 - ol ( Abcam ) 746 was added to 900 µL cell lysate . Following saponification at 60°C for 1 h , an additional 1 mL of 747 water was added to each sample and the aqueous phase extracted with 3 mL ethyl acetate by 748 vortexing and centrifugation at 2200 rpm . The organic phase was then extracted with 2 mL 749 water , concentrated to dryness by heating at 50°C under nitrogen flow , residue dissolved in 50 750 µL pyridine ( CHROMASOLV Plus , Sigma ) , and sterols derivatized in 50 µL N , O - 751 bis ( trimethylsilyl ) trifluoroacetamide with 1 % trimethylchlorosilane ( BSTFA + 1 % TMCS , Thermo 752 Fisher TS - 38831 ) at 60°C for 1 h . Sterol levels were determined by GC / MS analysis as 753 previously described ( Kelley , 1995 ) . Samples were analyzed by automatic injection of 1 µL of 754 the derivatized sterol mixture into an Agilent 7890 GC using a split injection port ( 4 mm ID x 755 78 . 5 mm quartz wool liner , Restek 23309 ) leading to a 0 . 18 mm ID x 20 m 1 , 4 - 756 bis ( dimethylsiloxy ) phenylene dimethyl polysiloxane column ( Restek , 43602 ) . Helium was used 757 as a carrier gas at a linear rate of 46 . 9 cm / sec . After 0 . 5 min at 170°C , the oven temperature 758 was raised to 250°C at 18°C / min , then to 280°C at 3°C / min , and finally to 320°C at 20°C / min 759 and held for 7 min . An Agilent 5977B mass spectrometer was operated in the electron impact 760 mode at 70 eV with an ion source temperature of 275°C . Analysis was performed using 761 MassHunter software . Identification of TMS ethers of natural sterols was determined through 762 comparison to commercially available standards for cholesterol , 7DHC , lathosterol , and 763 desmosterol ( Avanti Polar Lipids , Inc . ) , as well as comparison to MS spectra through the 764 National Institute of Standards and Technologies Standard Reference Database when available . 765 33 Identification of 8DHC was inferred as an isomer of 7DHC and comparison to SLOS fibroblasts ; 766 zymostenol identification was based on spectra from Conradi - Hünermann - Happle syndrome 767 ( CDPXD2 ) fibroblasts . Retention times and mass to charge ( m / z ) ratios are summarized in 768 Table S1 . Representative MS fragmentation patterns available upon request . TMS derivatives 769 of sterols exhibiting abundance < 3 % were excluded from analysis . For peak quantitation , sterol 770 abundance was normalized to both the internal standard ( coprostanol ) and protein 771 concentration . Data is presented relative to control samples using GraphPad Prism software . 772 Transferrin uptake assay . HEK293T cells were plated onto 0 . 1 % gelatin coated 12 mm 773 coverslips or 96 well glass bottom plates ( Cellvis ) and treated for 48 h under respective 774 treatment conditions . For AY9944 rescue experiments , cells were placed in DMEM / BSA ( DMEM 775 containing 0 . 5 % w / v BSA ; bovine serum albumin ) alone or DMEM / BSA containing 5 mM M β CD - 776 sterol complexes for 1 h in a 37°C humidified incubator containing 5 % CO 2 . HEK293T cells 777 were then incubated with transferrin ( Tfn ) conjugated to Alexa Fluor TM 555 ( 25 ug / mL , 778 Invitrogen ) for 30 mins at 37°C , followed by rinsing in ice - cold PBS , and fixation in 4 % 779 paraformaldehyde for 20 min . For high - content imaging analysis , 24 well glass bottom plates 780 ( Cellvis ) were imaged using CX7 Rescue High - Content Screening ( HCS ) Navigator software 781 ( PerkinElmer , Waltham , MA ) and standard HCS imaging protocol . 782 Patient fibroblasts were plated onto 0 . 1 % gelatin coated 12 mm coverslips 3 days prior to 783 imaging . Uptake was performed as described above using Tfn conjugated to Alexa Fluor TM 555 784 ( 25 ug / mL , Invitrogen ) for 15 min at 37°C . Following incubation , cells were rinsed with ice - cold 785 PBS . Cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 20 min , rinsed three times in PBS , and 786 mounted onto glass slides with Dako mounting media ( Agilent ) . Cell outlines were traced using 787 the freehand selection tool and the integrated density of 25 cells from 8 - 12 fields was quantified 788 using ImageJ software ( v1 . 8 . 0 ) . 789 34 Confocal microscopy . Images were captured using a Nikon A1R resonant scanning 790 multispectral confocal microscope ( Nikon Instruments , Inc . Melville , NY ) , equipped with a live 791 cell chamber ( 37°C with humidified 5 % CO 2 ) , Nikon Ti Perfect Focus system , and NIS - Elements 792 analysis software ( Nikon ) . 48 h prior to live - cell imaging , HEK293T cells plated onto 0 . 1 % 793 gelatin - coated FluoroDish TM culture plates ( 35 mm , World Precision Instruments Inc . ) were 794 rinsed twice with DMEM ( Gibco ) to remove residual lipids and respective treatments were 795 added . Prior to imaging , culture media was refreshed . Time - lapse videos were obtained at 100x 796 magnification ( 1 . 45 NA oil objective ) at 5 - 20 s intervals over a 5 min duration . 797 Polarized TIRF microscopy . SK - MEL - 2 hCLTA EN - Tq2 hDNM2 EN - eGFP cells were seeded 798 onto fibronectin - coated ( Corning ) 25 mm coverslips at a density of 8 . 0 x 10 4 cells / cm 2 and 799 imaged within 4 - 6 hours of plating . To facilitate membrane labeling , a fresh DiI ( 1 , 1’ - 800 Dioctadecyl - 3 , 3 , 3’ , 3’ - teramethylindocarboncyanine perchlorate ) solution containing 1 µg / mL DiI 801 in 2 . 5 % DMSO / HBSS ( Corning ) was prepared for each coverslip from a 1 mg / mL DiI stock 802 dissolved in DMSO and stored under nitrogen . After incubating the freshly prepared DiI solution 803 at 37°C for 5 min , 200 - 300 µL was added dropwise to coverslips containing 1 mL HBSS . Cells 804 were labeled for 20 s with gentle pipetting , rinsed three times in HBSS , and placed into imaging 805 buffer . Imaging buffer for all treatment conditions consisted of Leibovitz’s L - 15 media 806 supplemented with either 10 % FBS or delipidated ( LPDS ) serum ( Hyclone ) to monitor basal 807 CME events . Following DiI labeling , coverslips were immediately imaged for no more than 45 808 min . To ensure consistency in DiI labeling , only cells with mean S polarization intensities 809 between 350 - 800 were included in the analysis . 810 As previously detailed , TIRFM images were captured on a custom built Till iMic ( Till Photonics , 811 Germany ) inverted microscope outfitted with a 60x / 1 . 49 NA oil immersion objective and 812 environmental chamber kept at 37°C ( Scott et al . , 2018 ) . In brief , excitation for mTurquise2 , 813 eGFP , and polTIRF was achieved by 445 ( 470 / 22 ) , 488 ( 510 / 10 ) , 561 ( 595 / 50 ) nm lasers 814 35 respectively , collected on three EMCCD cameras ( iXon3 885 , Andor Technology ) . Back focal 815 plane centering was performed daily to optimize the incidence angle using MatLab analysis to 816 map the angles of TIRF reflectance and determine mirror angle adjustments to center the 817 optical plane . 2 - point TIRF illumination facilitated polarization of the 561 nm laser to enable 818 monitoring of membrane curvature . Focused excitation at 90° and 270° positions preferentially 819 excite vertically oriented , DiI - labeled membrane ( P polarization ) , while excitation at positions 0° 820 and 180° selectively excite horizontally labeled membrane ( S polarization ) . 821 Polarized TIRFM image analysis . Image registration was performed to align Turquoise2 and 822 eGFP channels onto the polTIRF channel . Calibration images of fluorescent beads on a glass 823 coverslip were acquired simultaneously on all three detectors and used to determine the 824 geometric transformation during pre - processing . Bias images , acquired by capturing images 825 with a closed shutter , were subtracted from each frame of the raw data . Using MatLab , 826 detection and tracking of fluorescence over time was performed using a modified version of 827 cmeAnalysis software ( Aguet et al . , 2013 ) and custom scripts were used for association and 828 classification of mTq2 , eGFP , and P / S events ( Scott et al . , 2018 ) . Detection criteria included a 829 clathrin peak SNR > 4 , dynamin SNR > 2 , clathrin lifetime > 7 seconds , and a buffer of two 830 consecutive frames before and after each clathrin track . Faulty tracks were filtered from the 831 analysis due to clathrin events crossing paths with another track and curvature signal unrelated 832 to the tracked clathrin event itself . 833 Transmission electron microscopy . SK - MEL - 2 cells were prepared as described for polTIRF 834 imaging by seeding onto fibronectin - coated 25 mm coverslips and allowed to adhere for 5 h . 835 Coverslips were transferred into 2 mL stabilization buffer ( 70 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 3 mM 836 EGTA , 30 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 ) prior to unroofing with a 10 mL syringe and 22 gauge , 1 . 5 in 837 needle containing 2 mL 4 % PFA ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) diluted in stabilization buffer . 838 Coverslips were transferred to fresh 2 % PFA / stabilization buffer and allowed to fix at RT for 20 839 36 min . Coverslips were mounted in 2 % glutaraldehyde and sealed with VALAP ( 1 : 1 : 1 vasoline , 840 lanolin , paraffin ) for shipping . Sample preparation and TEM imaging of platinum cell membrane 841 replicas was performed as previously described ( Sochacki et al . , 2017 ; Sochacki et al . , 2014 ) . 842 Representative full EM images available upon request . 843 Statistical analysis . All statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 8 . 0 . 2 844 ( GraphPad Software , Inc . , CA , US ) . Homogeneity of variances was tested by the Brown - 845 Forsythe test . In cases of equal variances , data was analyzed by one - way ANOVA and post hoc 846 Dunnett t - test for multiple comparisons relative to LPDS control group . In cases of unequal 847 variances , Welch ANOVA and post - hoc Dunnett’s T3 test was performed . P (cid:3) < (cid:3) 0 . 05 was 848 accepted as significant . Statistical details for each experiment can be found within figure 849 legends . 850 Data availability .
