Photobleaching analyses indicated dynamic exchange of aurora B between a centromeric and a cyto - plasmic pool before anaphase onset , and stable associations with microtubules after anaphase onset . Bleaching near centromeres upon anaphase onset affected the subsequent appearance of ﬂuorescence along midzone microtubules , but not that near the lateral equatorial cortex , suggesting T that there were centromeric - dependent and - independent pathways that transported aurora B to the equator . The former delivered centromeric aurora B along midzone microtubules , whereas the latter delivered cytoplasmic aurora B along astral microtubules . We suggest that cultured cells use midzone microtubules as the primary signaling pathway for cytokinesis , whereas embryos , with their stockpile of cytoplasmic proteins and large sizes , rely primarily on astral microtubules . Introduction Cytokinesis is the final stage of cell division critical for the proper separation of chromosomes and organelles into two daughter cells . Despite much attention , it is still unclear how cytokinesis is coordinated with mitosis . Two major models have been raised for signaling cytokinesis ( for reviews see Glotzer , 1997 ; Oegema and Mitchison , 1997 ; Glotzer , 2001 ; Wang , 2001 ) . The first model contends that astral micro - tubules are primarily responsible for signaling cytokinesis . Its main evidence came from the classical study by Rappaport ( 1961 ) , who demonstrated the formation of ectopic furrows between two adjacent mitotic spindles in micromanipulated sand dollar embryos . A similar study with artificially fused epithelial cells also found ectopic furrowing between neigh - boring spindles in a fraction of cells ( Rieder et al . , 1997 ) . These experiments not only supported a model of stimulation based on overlapping astral microtubules ( Rappaport , 1986 ; Devore et al . , 1989 ; Harris and Gewalt , 1989 ) , but also argued against a direct contribution of chromosomes to cytokinesis . An equally compelling set of evidence suggests that chromo - somes and midzone microtubules , which extend from separated chromosomes toward the equatorial region during late mitosis , play a key role in signaling cytokinesis . For example , cyto - kinesis is inhibited by a perforation between the equatorial cortex and the spindle , even though the cortex has main - tained its access to astral microtubules ( Cao and Wang , 1996 ) . In addition , under a number of experimental condi - tions , cortical ingression is correlated with the organization of midzone microtubules and their proximity to the cortex ( Wheatley and Wang , 1996 ; Eckley et al . , 1997 ; Giansanti et al . , 1998 ) . Treatment of cells with topoisomerase II inhib - itors further revealed a set of microtubules that emanated laterally from the tangled chromosomes toward the cortex immediately before the ingression ( Wheatley et al . , 1998 ) . These observations were corroborated by the discovery of a set of chromosomal passenger proteins , which relocate from centromeres to the equatorial region along midzone micro - tubules after anaphase onset ( Martineau - Thuillier et al . , 1998 ; Adams et al . , 2001a ) . At least some of these proteins , including inner centromere protein ( INCENP ) * and aurora B , were essential for cytokinesis ( Schumacher et al . , 1998 ; Kaitna et al . , 2000 ; Severson et al . , 2000 ; Adams et al . , 2001b ; Giet and Glover , 2001 ; Leverson et al . , 2002 ; Murata - Hori et al . , 2002 ) .

Critical insights into this puzzle may be gained by a de - tailed understanding of the dynamics of chromosomal pas - senger proteins . One of these proteins , aurora B , is known to play an essential role in both early and late stages of cell divi - sion , including chromosome congression , spindle check - point , chromosome segregation , and cytokinesis ( Schu - macher et al . , 1998 ; Kaitna et al . , 2000 ; Severson et al . , 2000 ; Adams et al . , 2001b ; Giet and Glover , 2001 ; Kallio et al . , 2002 ; Tanaka et al . , 2002 ; Leverson et al . , 2002 ; Murata - Hori and Wang , 2002 ; Murata - Hori et al . , 2002 ) . In the present study , we have applied FRAP , micromanipulation , and drug treatment to probe the dynamics of aurora B in di - viding normal rat kidney ( NRK ) cells . Our data suggested that centromeric aurora B exchanges dynamically with a cy - toplasmic pool during early mitosis . This exchange process stops upon anaphase onset , when centromeric aurora B be - comes relocated to midzone microtubules and cytoplasmic aurora B is localized to astral microtubules . We further sug - gested that both pathways contribute to the signaling of cytokinesis , and that the differences in their relative con - tributions may explain the apparently conflicting views of cytokinesis signaling . Results Aurora B is a dynamic component of the centromere during early mitosis We first applied FRAP analysis to investigate the mobility of aurora B at centromeres during prometaphase . Cells express - ing aurora B fused to GFP ( aurora B – GFP ; Murata - Hori et al . , 2002 ) were photobleached at centromeres with a small laser beam , and the recovery rate assessed from time - lapse images . The bleaching caused an (cid:2) 4 % decrease in total cel - lular fluorescence , with no detectable effect on mitosis or cy - tokinesis . As shown in Fig . 1 ( Video 1 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200207014 / DC1 ) , fluo - rescence returned to bleached centromeres with a relatively high rate ( t 1 / 2 (cid:2) 47 (cid:3) 24 s , n (cid:2) 13 ) and extent ( 78 % ; Table I ) , indicating that most aurora B at centromeres was able to exchange with a noncentromeric pool . Similar results were obtained whether the bleached centromere was isolated or within a group of centromeres . To assess if microtubules affect the turnover of aurora B at centromeres , we performed FRAP experiments after the dis - assembly of microtubules with 1 (cid:4) M nocodazole ( Fig . 2 A ; Video 2 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200207014 / DC1 ) . The mobile fraction of centromeric aurora B decreased from 78 % to 59 % , and the turnover rate also decreased slightly from that in untreated cells ( t 1 / 2 (cid:2) 62 (cid:3) 19 s , n (cid:2) 20 ; Table I ) . However , only the former was statistically significant ( P (cid:5) 0 . 01 ; Table I ) . We next asked if the turnover rate of aurora B was affected by its kinase activ - Table I .

FRAP analysis of GFP - tagged , kinase - inac - tive mutant of aurora B ( aurora B [ K - R ] - GFP ; Fig . 2 B ; Video 3 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200207014 / DC1 ) at centromeres indicated a significant difference from wild - type aurora B - GFP in both the turn - over rate ( t 1 / 2 (cid:2) 84 s vs . 47 s , P (cid:5) 0 . 01 ; Table I ) , and the mobile fraction ( 48 % vs . 78 % , P (cid:5) 0 . 01 ; Table I ) . These re - sults suggested a limited dependence of the turnover of cen - tromeric aurora B – GFP on microtubules and a stronger de - pendence on its kinase activity . Aurora B shows a very slow turnover along midzone microtubules during late mitosis Aurora B is known to relocate from centromeres to midzone microtubules after anaphase onset , and eventually to the midbody during telophase ( Schumacher et al . , 1998 ; Adams et al . , 2001b ; Giet and Glover , 2001 ; Murata - Hori et al . , 2002 ) . To determine if aurora B underwent similar turnover at the midbody as at centromeres , we bleached half of the midbody with a small laser beam . As shown in Fig . 3 ( Video 4 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200207014 / DC1 ) , there was only a very limited recov - ery of aurora B – GFP in the bleached region , and a corre - sponding limited loss of fluorescence in the unbleached re - gion , during the period of observation . In both regions the rate of change was too low for a reliable measurement of the halftime . These results suggested that aurora B was stably as - sociated with the midbody . The turnover rate of aurora B during anaphase was more difficult to measure , due to the rapid , extensive reorganiza - tion of spindle structures and the relocation of chromosomal passenger proteins . Therefore , we performed bleaching im - mediately after anaphase onset , when most aurora B in the equatorial region was still localized either at centromeres or Figure 2 .

This allowed us to bleach nearly all aurora B at or near centromeres with a large laser beam , and to ask if midzone microtubules subse - quently became fluorescent as in nonbleached cells . The bleaching caused an (cid:2) 30 % decrease in total cellular fluores - cence ; however diffuse , cytoplasmic fluorescence returned to the bleached region within 10 s . As shown in Fig . 4 ( Video 5 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200207014 / DC1 ) , except for the region near the lateral equatorial cortex ( discussed below ) , no bright fluorescent structures were subsequently found in the equatorial region at the onset of cytokinesis . This was in contrast to the strik - ing concentration of fluorescence along the array of midzone microtubules seen in unbleached cells ( n (cid:2) 20 ; Fig . 4 , C and C (cid:7) ) . The extent of equatorial localization remained much lower in bleached cells than that in unbleached cells through - out cytokinesis over a period of 5 min ( Fig . 4 , D and D (cid:7) ) . Furthermore , when aurora B – GFP was partially bleached around centromeres , reduced fluorescence was found along the corresponding portion of midzone microtubules during cytokinesis ( unpublished data ) . Together , these results sug - gest that aurora B relocated directly from centromeres to midzone microtubules with a very limited turnover . Cytoplasmic aurora B is transported to the equatorial cortex along astral microtubules Surprisingly , despite the extensive bleaching of fluorescence at central equatorial region , and the large decrease of aurora B – GFP fluorescence along midzone microtubules in the pre - vious experiment , concentration of aurora B – GFP developed near the lateral equatorial cortex ( Fig . 4 , C and D , arrows ) , suggesting that there might be a centromere - independent pathway that delivered cytoplasmic aurora B to the equatorial cortex . To determine if astral microtubules played a role in this process , NRK cells expressing aurora B – GFP were treated with a low dose of nocodazole ( 150 nM ) , which causes a pref - erential disassembly of astral microtubules ( O’Connell and Wang , 2000 ) . Compared with control cells ( Fig . 5 A , right ) , nocodazole - treated cells showed a pronounced reduction of aurora B along the lateral equatorial cortex ( Fig . 5 A , left ) , whereas midzone microtubules maintained a strong accumu - lation of aurora B ( Fig . 5 A , right ; Murata - Hori et al . , 2002 ) . As an alternative approach , a perforation was generated be - tween the central spindle and the equatorial cortex ( Fig . 5 B ) . As was shown previously ( Cao and Wang , 1996 ) , the region between the perforation and the lateral cortex contained only astral microtubules . Immunofluorescence staining of aurora B indicated a small but detectable amount of aurora B along the cortex of this region ( 4 / 5 , Fig . 5 B , inset ) , suggesting that astral microtubules were able to mediate the transport of a minor fraction of aurora B to the equatorial cortex . Both midzone and astral microtubules contribute to the signaling of cytokinesis To determine the functional role of astral microtubules in cy - tokinesis , we examined the cytokinesis of cells treated with 150 nM nocodazole to disassemble preferentially astral mi - crotubules as described above . As reported previously , these cells showed a high frequency of mispositioned spindles ( O’Connell and Wang , 2000 ) . We found that cytokinesis be - came highly asymmetric when the spindle was located closer to one side of the lateral cortex than the other side by (cid:8) 50 % ( Fig . 6 A ) . Deep ingression occurred on the side with a short distance , whereas no ingression or shallow ingression took place on the other side ( 77 % , n (cid:2) 13 ) . Thus , midzone mi - crotubules by themselves were not able to signal cytokinesis over a long distance , and astral microtubules were likely in - volved in the early phase of cytokinesis before the cortex was brought near the spindle by the ingression . However , astral microtubules by themselves were insufficient for stimulating cortical ingression in NRK cells , as indicated by the previous observation that a perforation imposed between the cortex and the spindle blocks local ingression despite the presence of astral microtubules and some aurora B in the region ( 0 / 9 , Fig . 5 B ; Video 6 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200207014 / DC1 ; Cao and Wang , 1996 ) . To test the possibility that the effectiveness of astral mi - crotubules in stimulating cytokinesis is determined by the amount of aurora B delivered by these microtubules , we per - formed the perforation experiment with cells expressing a Figure 3 . Stable association of aurora B at the midbody . Fluorescence images of the cells were acquired before ( A ) and after ( B – E ) photobleaching half of the midbody in a cell expressing aurora B – GFP . Time is shown in min : s . The graph shows a very slow increase of fluorescence intensity in the bleached region . Conversely , the unbleached half shows no appreciable decrease in fluorescence intensity .

In contrast to non - transfected cells ( Fig . 5 B ) , these cells showed a variable de - gree of ingression along the equatorial cortex blocked from the spindle ( 15 / 18 , Figs . 6 B , arrow , and S1 ; Video 7 , avail - able at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200207014 / DC1 ) . Immunofluorescence confirmed the presence of a larger amount of aurora B along the cortex than in untrans - fected cells ( Fig . 6 B ) . Together , these experiments indicate that both astral and midzone microtubules played a role in signaling cytokinesis . Discussion Dynamics of aurora B during early mitosis Previous studies have demonstrated an essential role of au - rora B and other chromosomal passenger proteins in signal - ing cytokinesis . These proteins are localized at centromeres in early mitosis , and along midzone microtubules during late mitosis ( Adams et al . , 2001a ) . Thus , the simplest model for the stimulation of cytokinesis would involve a transport mechanism , which delivers these proteins from centromeres to the equatorial cortex along midzone microtubules . How - ever , although this model provides a plausible explanation for the spatial and temporal coordination of cytokinesis with mitosis , it does not easily explain the observations that con - vincingly demonstrated the involvement of astral microtu - bules ( Rappaport , 1961 ; Rieder et al . , 1997 ) . A more comprehensive understanding of this signaling process may be achieved through a better characterization of the behavior of the chromosomal passenger proteins during various stages of cell division . In the present study , we have applied a combination of FRAP , drug treatment and micro - manipulation to study the dynamics of aurora B . The first significant finding is that aurora B , and likely other chromo - somal passenger proteins , is not a stable passenger of the chromosomes , but constantly hops on and off centromeres prior to anaphase onset . Moreover , because the turnover rate is not significantly affected by the disassembly of microtu - bules , the process likely involves a cytoplasmic pool that in - teracts directly with the centromeres . The half recovery time of aurora B at centromeres , 47 (cid:3) 24 s , was not drastically different from that of the check - point protein Mad2 ( (cid:2) 24 – 28 s ; Howell et al . , 2000 ) . More - over , nocodazole had a similar detectable effect on the mo - bile fraction of both proteins at centromeres ( Howell et al . , 2000 ) . The similar behavior of aurora B and Mad2 during prometaphase raises the possibility that checkpoint proteins and chromosomal passenger proteins may form a complex during early stages of mitosis . A mechanism linked to the spindle checkpoint may maintain the integrity of the com - plex and keep aurora B from associating with microtubules upon anaphase onset . Consistent with this idea , we found that the kinase activity of aurora B is involved in maintain - ing the binding of Mad2 and microtubule motor proteins at prometaphase kinetochores ( Murata - Hori and Wang , 2002 ; Murata - Hori et al . , 2002 ) . In addition , the possibility of a kinase - regulated complex is supported by the dependence of the mobility of aurora B on its kinase activity ( Table I ) , and by the dependence of Mad2 turnover on ATP ( Howell et al . , 2000 ) . Dynamics of aurora B during late mitosis and cytokinesis Upon anaphase onset , aurora B is transferred from cen - tromeres to midzone microtubules . The concentration and limited turnover of fluorescence at the midbody suggested a change from dynamic association at centromeres , to stable association with a highly possessive motor that migrated along microtubules to the midbody . However , the most in - teresting finding was the identification of two discrete path - ways that deliver aurora B to the equatorial region . First , bleaching of aurora B – GFP at central equatorial region dur - ing early anaphase caused a strong reduction in the subse - quent concentration of fluorescence along midzone microtu - bules . The observation is most easily explained by a direct relocation of centromeric aurora B to midzone microtubules during early anaphase , coupled to a limited exchange of Figure 4 . Photobleaching of aurora B – GFP during anaphase . A large laser beam was used to bleach aurora B – GFP around centromeres at early anaphase . Fluorescence images were acquired before ( A ) and after ( B – D ) photobleaching . Few fluorescent structures emerged in the spindle midzone ( C and D ) , whereas strong fluorescence was observed along the midzone microtubules in a nonbleached cell ( C (cid:7) and D (cid:7) ) . Concentration of aurora B – GFP was observed primarily along the lateral edges of the equatorial region despite the bleaching ( C and D , arrows ) . Time after the anaphase onset is shown in min : s .

However , some fluorescent aurora B did appear near the lateral equatorial cortex despite the extensive bleaching of the equatorial region at early anaphase . Although it is dif - ficult to rule out the contributions from residual unbleached aurora B , or from a very slow exchange between microtu - bule - associated and cytoplasmic aurora B , we noticed that the distribution of fluorescent structures is biased toward the lateral edges of the cell . This suggests that the fluorescence was associated with a subset of microtubules and that there may be a second mechanism that delivered noncentromeric aurora B to the equator . Our results corroborate the previous finding that a number of chromosomal passenger proteins showed discrete localiza - tions both on the lateral equatorial cortex and along midzone microtubules during anaphase , whereas some kinetochore proteins such as CENP - E were found only along midzone microtubules ( Martineau - Thuillier et al . , 1998 ) . The inhibi - tion of lateral cortical localization by low doses of nocoda - zole , and the insensitivity of such localization to cell perfora - tion , further suggests that the transport of this fraction of aurora B involves primarily astral microtubules . These micro - tubules reach various regions of the dividing cell : some con - centrated directly onto the equatorial cortex whereas others are incorporated into midzone microtubule bundles near the equatorial cortex . This explains the curious pattern of fluores - cence seen during early and late cytokinesis after the equato - rial region was bleached with a large laser beam ( Fig . 4 D ) . Therefore , the most plausible explanation is that the cy - toplasmic pool of aurora B , which is involved in the ex - change with the centromeric pool during prometaphase , is recruited preferentially to astral microtubules after ana - phase onset and subsequently transported to the cortex by a similar mechanism that transports centromeric aurora B along midzone microtubules . The preferential recruitment of cytoplasmic aurora B to astral microtubules implies that midzone microtubules may differ qualitatively from astral microtubules , as suggested also by their differential sensitiv - ity to nocodazole ( Wheatley and Wang , 1996 ; O’Connell and Wang , 2000 ) . Alternatively , the localization to astral microtubules may require specific entry points such as the spindle pole . Signaling of cytokinesis in animal cells We suggest that there are two mechanisms that deliver cleavage signals to the equatorial cortex . The first mechanism is medi - ated by cytoplasmic aurora B and astral microtubules . It func - tions primarily during the early stage of cytokinesis , before the cortex is brought to the vicinity of the mitotic spindle by in - gression . In addition , it is capable of delivering the signal not only to the equator but also to other regions accessible to astral microtubules , including the polar cortex . Thus , this mecha - nism is responsible for the ectopic furrowing between two adja - cent mitotic spindles , as seen in the experiments of Rappaport ( 1961 ) and Rieder et al . ( 1997 ) . The second mechanism is me - diated by centromeric aurora B and midzone microtubules . It Figure 5 . Transport of cytoplasmic aurora B to the equatorial cortex along astral microtubules .

( B ) Immunofluorescence of endogenous aurora B after cell perforation ( arrow ) . The perforation , positioned near the left edge of the metaphase plate , caused inhibition of cytokinesis on the side blocked from the mitotic spindle ( boxed region ) . The perforation migrated toward the upper right as a result of biased ingression activities ( arrow ; Cao and Wang , 1996 ) . The cell was subse - quently fixed and stained with anti – aurora B antibodies . Most aurora B was detected on the cleaving side . However , very faint staining of aurora B was observed along the cortex of the perforated side upon enhancement of the image ( inset ) .

The relative contribution of the two pathways likely varies among different cell types . In NRK cells , the astral microtu - bule pathway delivers only a limited amount of aurora B to the cortex , and is insufficient for stimulating cytokinesis as indicated by the failure of ingression in perforated cells . However , it plays a synergistic role with the midzone micro - tubule pathway and becomes increasingly important as the spindle is further separated from the cortex , as indicated by the experiments with low dose nocodazole . This mechanism also explains the somewhat equivocal role of centrosomes in cytokinesis , as suggested by an increased failure in cyto - kinesis upon the ablation of centrosomes ( Khodjakov and Rieder , 2001 ) . The contribution of the astral microtubule versus mid - zone microtubule pathway is likely determined by the rela - tive amount of centromeric and cytoplasmic aurora B at ana - phase onset , the length of astral microtubules , and the distance between the spindle and the cortex . We found that the effect of astral microtubule pathway increased with the level of expression of aurora B in NRK cells , eventually over - coming the inhibitory effect of perforation . This pathway likely plays a major role in early embryos , where aurora B may exist in stockpiles and the spindle is separated from the cortex by up to several hundred microns . Although our results readily reconcile the two apparently conflicting models of cytokinesis , many important questions remain . Of prime importance is the mechanism that regu - lates the localization and dynamics of aurora B at early ana - phase , and the mechanism that transports aurora B to the cortex . Equally important are the targets of aurora B both before and after anaphase onset . The diverse effects of the disruption of aurora B suggest that there are multiple targets at various structures including centromeres and the cortex . Moreover , as an increase in aurora B is sufficient to over - come the inhibitory effect of perforation , it is reasonable to assume that aurora B indeed represents a key component in the signaling mechanism of cytokinesis .

The cells were maintained at 37 (cid:9) C in a stage incubator built on top of a Zeiss Axiovert S100TV or an Axiovert 35 inverted microscope , Figure 6 . Involvement of both astral and midzone microtubules in signaling cytokinesis . ( A ) Cells were treated with 150 nM nocodazole ( a – d ) for at least 3 h before observation .

All images were acquired with a cooled charge - coupled device camera ( ST133 controller and CCD57 chip ; Roper Scientific ) and processed with custom software for background subtraction . Transfection , drug treatment , and micromanipulation of the cells NRK cells were plated on a coverslip chamber dish and incubated for 18 – 24 h . Immediately before transfection , the cells were rinsed once in Opti - MEM I medium ( Life Technologies ) . The cells were transfected with the DNA constructs ( 1 to 2 (cid:4) g ) using LipofectAMINE according to manu - facturer’s instructions ( Life Technologies ) . After 4 h incubation , the me - dium containing DNA - LipofectAMINE was replaced with the F12K me - dium containing 10 % FBS , and the cells were cultured for an additional 14 – 16 h . Nocodazole ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was stored at – 20 (cid:9) C as 10 3 (cid:10) stocks in DMSO and diluted into prewarmed medium before application to cells . Cell perforation was performed as described previously ( Cao and Wang , 1996 ) . Laser photobleaching and data analysis Photobleaching experiments were performed with 476 . 5 nm Argon ion laser at 50 mW for bleaching small areas , or 200 mW for bleaching large areas . The laser beam was passed through a combined spatial fil - ter – beam expander ( Newport Corp . ) and was focused with an f (cid:2) 475 mm plano - convex lens ( Optics for Research ) to the plane of the epi - illu - minator field diaphragm of a Zeiss Axiovert 35 microscope . All bleach - ing experiments were performed with a 100 (cid:10) , NA 1 . 30 Fluar lens and with 50 - ms laser pulses . The size of the laser beam was controlled by moving the exit lens of the spatial filter – beam expander . The full - width half - maximal size of the laser beam on the objective plane , measured by imaging the attenuated beam with a thin layer of fluorescent solu - tion , was 0 . 6 (cid:4) m for small beams and 5 . 7 (cid:4) m for large beams . The ac - tual size of the bleached region was measured by dividing the images of the cell immediately before and after bleaching , and determining the di - ameter where the ratio drops by 50 % . The small beam typically created a bleached region 4 . 3 (cid:4) m in diameter , whereas the large beam created a spot 11 . 1 (cid:4) m in diameter . A mirror mounted on a computer - controlled , rotating wheel controlled the entry of laser versus the illumination beam from an attenuated 103W mercury arc lamp into the microscope . The computer , with custom pro - grams , also controlled the acquisition of images before and after bleach - ing . The dichroic mirror and emission filter for the epi - illuminator were from a Chroma Technology 51004 v2 SBX double - band filter set for fluo - rescein and tetramethylrhodamine . The excitation filter was a 490 nm , 7 . 3 - nm band - pass filter ( Coherent Ealing ) , mounted with a BG - 38 heat filter in front of the arc lamp . Images of fluorescence recovery were captured every 5 – 30 s . The measurement of the fluorescence intensity was performed with custom software . Because the image acquisition process caused no signifi - cant fluorescence photobleaching ( (cid:2) 3 % over the period of acquisition ) , the images were corrected only for the camera background . The turnover rate was determined by plotting ln ( i (cid:11) (cid:6) i t ) versus time , where i (cid:11) is the fluorescence intensity in the bleached area at time infinity and i t is the fluorescence intensity at time t . The rate constant k was mea - sured as the negative slope of the plot and the halftime was calculated as t 1 / 2 (cid:2) ln2 * ( (cid:6) 1 / k ) . The percent mobile fraction was calculated from i (cid:11) , the intensity immediately after bleaching i 0 , and the prebleaching fluorescence in - tensity i pre : 100 % [ i (cid:11) – i 0 ] / [ i pre - i 0 ] . The value of i 0 was calculated by extrapolat - ing the plot of ln ( i (cid:11) - i t ) versus t to t (cid:2) 0 . The significance of the results was as - sessed using analysis of variance and Student’s t test in Microsoft Excel . Immunofluorescence Cells were rinsed with warm cytoskeleton buffer and fixed with 4 % para - formaldehyde ( EM Science ) in warm cytoskeleton buffer for 10 min ( Wheatley and Wang , 1996 ) . They were then rinsed thoroughly in the cy - toskeleton buffer and permeabilized by incubation with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in cytoskeleton buffer for 5 min . Fixed cells were rinsed with the cytoskel - eton buffer , blocked for 10 min with 1 % BSA ( Boehringer Mannheim ) in PBS , and then incubated with anti – AIM - 1 monoclonal antibodies ( Murata - Hori et al . , 2000 , 2002 ) at a dilution of 1 : 100 in PBS with 1 % BSA for 45 min at 37 (cid:9) C . After washing with PBS / BSA thoroughly , the cells were incu - bated with Alexa 546 – conjugated goat anti – mouse antibodies ( Molecular Probes ) at a dilution of 1 : 100 for 30 min at 37 (cid:9) C .
