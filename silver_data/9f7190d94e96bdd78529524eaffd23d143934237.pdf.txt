A graphic table illustrating MDFF refinement of a model of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase using a high - resolution map . The map represents an open conformation while the initial search model was obtained through crystallography of a closed conformation . This search model was independently fitted , using direct MDFF , to individual members of a set of maps obtained by applying Gaussian blurs of various half - widths ( s , first column ) to the experimental density . These maps are visualized as a 3D surface in the second column , while the resulting MDFF potentials V EM are represented in cross - section in the third column . Notice the increase in number of contiguous density regions as s increases . This increase in contiguity is manifested in the lowering of high V EM barriers ( red ) for small s values to low or flat energy profiles ( blue ) for larger s values , as observed in the V EM potential cross - sections . Reduced barrier heights allow the structure to explore the conformational space freely during fitting . The structure after 500 ps of fitting , shown in red , is superimposed on the known target structure , shown in blue , in the fourth column . The time evolution of RMSD with respect to the target during fitting is shown in the fifth column . The RMSD plots show that direct fitting to lower resolution maps requires fewer time steps to reach convergence . In fact , the structure never becomes less deviated than the initial 7 - A˚ RMSD from the target in the direct MDFF of the highest - resolution map ( i . e . in the absence of Gaussian blurring ) . The inset shows refinements of the same structure through cMDFF and ReMDFF employing the same set of maps . A clear improvement over direct MDFF is apparent , with convergence to within 1 . 7 A ˚ and 1 . 0 A ˚ of the target achieved within 1000 and 100 ps for cMDFF and ReMDFF respectively .

Models of ( a ) b - galactosidase and ( b ) TRPV1 , obtained from cMDFF ( blue ) and direct MDFF ( red ) fitting simulations are superimposed . The cMDFF - fitted models fit well into the high - resolution maps ( grey ) of each molecule , whereas the direct MDFF models have become trapped in local minima that result in portions of the models protruding from the maps . ReMDFF - fitted models are almost identical to those from cMDFF and are therefore not shown . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 16105 . 005 Singharoy et al . eLife 2016 ; 5 : e16105 .

Global cross - correlation as a measure of fit . The blue and red structures represent the same region of a segment of TRPV1 that have been fitted differently into the density map shown . The global cross - correlations of the structural region shown in each case are 0 . 728 ( red ) and 0 . 723 ( blue ) . However , the blue structure is clearly better fitted than the red structure , as reflected in RMSDs from the published structure of 6 . 2 A˚ ( red ) and 2 . 3 A˚ ( blue ) . Although the case described is an extreme one , it shows that global cross - correlation , as a measure of fit , can be misleading , particularly in regards to local correspondence of residues to the map .

Comparison of initial models to target ( published ) models . For the purpose of testing cMDFF on ( a ) b - galactosidase and ( b ) TRPV1 , the published models ( blue ) were distorted to provide the initial models ( red ) for fitting . In the case of TRPV1 , the distortion was applied to only one subunit . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 16105 . 007 Singharoy et al . eLife 2016 ; 5 : e16105 .

Convergence of cMDFF , ReMDFF , and direct MDFF simulations . RMSD over simulation time is plotted for the cMDFF , ReMDFF , and direct MDFF simulations of ( a ) b - galactosidase and ( b ) TRPV1 monomer . RMSD is calculated with respect to the published models ( PDB 3J7H for 3 . 2 - A˚ resolution and PDB 5A1A for 2 . 2 - A˚ resolution ) . For ReMDFF , the plot contains data from a single , best - fit , replica . ( inset ) Same as ( b ) but now for the TRPV1 tetramer . For both b - galactosidase , and TRPV1 monomer and tetramer , cMDFF and ReMDFF outperformed direct MDFF in terms of both efficiency and fitting accuracy , as reflected in Tables 1 and Supplementary file 1A .

Local cross - correlations during direct MDFF to refine de novo structures . Local cross - correlations of residues within the fitted regions of ( a ) b - galactosidase and ( b ) TRPV1 plotted over the course of direct MDFF of the respective de novo structures show little change . The large - scale structure of the starting de novo models are already well - fitted within the maps , increases in fit and overall structure quality of the refined de novo structures over the starting structures are thus due to local , sporadic improvements .

Equilibration of cMDFF - refined model of b - galactosidase . The model resulting from a cMDFF fitting of b - galactosidase to the 3 . 2 - A˚ map is subject to an equilibration MD simulation . The RMSD plot of the structure shows that it converges within 10 ns to an RMSD value of 3 A˚ . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 16105 . 011 Singharoy et al . eLife 2016 ; 5 : e16105 .

Residues of b - galactosidase fitted within density map . Several examples of residue segments , consisting of residues ( a ) 50 – 55 , ( b ) 179 – 189 , ( c ) 310 – 320 , and ( d ) 413 – 420 , are shown within the corresponding map regions . In general , both backbone and sidechains were found to have fitted well after MDFF refinement . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 16105 . 012 Singharoy et al . eLife 2016 ; 5 : e16105 .

The reported structures for ( a ) b - galactosidase and ( b ) TRPV1 were each fitted by direct MDFF against two half - maps , labelled 1 and 2 , from their respective EM data . Simulated maps were generated from the resulting structures , with labels corresponding to the half - maps used in the fitting . FSC plots of the simulated maps against the half - maps are so similar that they superimpose on one another . In addition , the differences in iFSCs between the various plots are negligible . These results demonstrate that the MDFF method , with the parameters used in the present study , does not overfit the structure .

Models colored by local resolution , square of RMSF , and B - factor . The published models of ( a ) b - galactosidase ( PDB 5A1A ) and ( b ) TRPV1 ( PDB 3J5P ) are colored by the local EM map resolutions , the per - residue mean square fluctuations ( RMSF 2 ) during MDFF simulation , and published B - factors . Comparison of these figures shows qualitative agreement between local resolution , RMSF 2 , and B - factor . In fact , the local resolutions and B - factors correlate linearly with RMSF 2 of a fitted model both in the presence as well as absence of the EM map ( more details in Figure 4 ) .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 16105 12 of 22 Tools and resources Biophysics and Structural Biology Computational and Systems Biology Figure 4 . RMSF vs . local resolution plots for various simulations . For each test case shown , atoms in the MDFF - refined structure are classified by local resolution of the map regions they are fitted into . The average RMSF value of atoms ( during MDFF simulation ) in each resolution bin is calculated and plotted against the local resolution in the cases of ( a ) b - galactosidase ( b - gal ) at 2 . 2 A˚ , ( b ) TRPV1 at 3 . 4 A˚ , g - secretase ( g - sec ) at ( c ) 3 . 4 A˚ and ( d ) 4 . 5 A˚ resolution , and proteasome ( see Figure 4—figure supplement 3 ) . The numbers of atoms in the resolution bins are displayed as a histogram ( in red ) spanning a system - specific range of resolutions . The lowest resolution bins contained low ( < 20 ) populations and visual inspection consistently revealed the atoms to be on the edges of the density or were otherwise located inside map noise , and were therefore ignored during further analysis . A clear linear correlation between RMSF and local resolution can be found in each case , such that applying a linear fit produces the high R 2 value shown in each graph heading . Also displayed in each heading is an overall RMSF , averaged over all atoms in the system . The overall RMSF reflects the conformational variety of structures that fit within the map , and is found to correspond to the map resolution such that higher resolutions produce lower RMSFs . The second row of plots show that the RMSF during MDFF simulation also linearly correlates with RMSF during unbiased MD simulations of ( e ) b - gal , ( f ) TRPV1 and ( g , h ) g - sec , establishing that fluctuations during MDFF reflect the inherent flexibility of a system .

EMRinger score and LCC do not predict local resolution in TRPV1 . Published models corresponding to the 2 . 2 - A˚ and 3 . 2 - A˚ maps of b - galactosidase are fitted to their respective maps using direct MDFF . The RMSF values of all the residues along the protein sequence are plotted showing those from the 2 . 2 - A˚ map are lesser than those from 3 . 2 - A˚ map .

Average RMSF vs . local resolution during MDFF simulation of proteasome .

Effect of map sharpening on residue flexibility of b - galactosidase . ( a ) Overall RMSF of a fitted 2 . 2A˚ b - galactosidase structure ( PDB 5A1A ) during direct MDFF fitting as a function of the B - factor of the fitting map exhibits a parabolic trend . Guinier analysis identifies a B - factor of (cid:0) 75 as optimal , for which the corresponding RMSF ( shown in red ) coincides with the minimum of the trend line . EMRinger scores ( shown in blue ) of the same structures show a negative parabolic trend , with the peak coinciding with the minimum of the RMSF plot . ( b ) The linear relationships between local RMSF during MDFF and during unbiased MD for the unsharpened map and optimally sharpened map are compared . While the linear relationship is preserved in both cases , RMSFs in the sharpened case are slightly lower than in the unsharpened case .

Effect of map sharpening on residue flexibility in TRPV1 . RMSF values of a fitted TRPV1 structure during MDFF fitting as a function of the B - factor of the fitting map exhibits a parabolic trend . This trend is prsented for ( a ) the whole protein , ( b ) the soluble region , and ( c ) the transmembrane domain . Guinier analysis identifies a B - factor of (cid:0) 100 as optimal for the whole protein as well as the transmembrane domain ; the soluble region is characterized by a B - factor of (cid:0) 150 . These B - factors are in close agreement with those representing a minimal RMSF : (cid:0) 100 ( whole protein ) , (cid:0) 150 to (cid:0) 200 ( soluble region ) , (cid:0) 100 to (cid:0) 125 ( transmembrane domain ) .

Effect of map sharpening on residue flexibility in g - secretase . ( a ) Overall RMSF of a fitted g - secretase structure during MDFF fitting plotted as a function of the B - factor of the fitting map forms a parabola . Guinier analysis of map sharpening identifies a B - factor of (cid:0) 131 as optimal . The corresponding RMSF ( shown in red ) lies close to the minimum of the parabola . ( b ) The linear relationships between local RMSF during MDFF and during unbiased MD for the unsharpened map and the sharpened map of B - factor (cid:0) 100 are compared . For all but the first resolution bin , RMSF for the sharpened map is higher than that of the unsharpened map . However , the first resolution bin contains about 98 % of atoms in the structure , so that atoms in the other bins are outliers , which fall into map regions of non - optimal local resolution .

EMRinger scores as a function of B - factor . For the cases of ( a ) b - galactosidase and ( b ) g - secretase , the reported model was fitted to maps sharpened with various B - factors . EMRinger scores for the fitted model / map pairs are plotted against the corresponding B - factors . The maxima of the plots , at B - factors (cid:0) 50 and (cid:0) 100 for b - galactosidase and g - secretase respectively , correspond with the RMSF minima in Figures 4a and 4—figure supplement 1a .

Atom - by - atom B - factor for a b - galactosidase monomer . The B - factor , measured for each atom employing the relationship 8 p 2 / 3 ( RMSF ) 2 employing RMSF values from Figure 3 ( black line ) , are fairly comparable to the B - factors reported experimentally ( red rhombus ) . An overall cross - correlation of 55 % is found between these two sets of B - factors . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 16105 . 026 Singharoy et al . eLife 2016 ; 5 : e16105 .
