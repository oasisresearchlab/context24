Volume 28 November 7 , 2017 3203 MBoC | ARTICLE Analysis of interphase node proteins in fission yeast by quantitative and superresolution fluorescence microscopy ABSTRACT We used quantitative confocal microscopy and FPALM superresolution micros - copy of live fission yeast to investigate the structures and assembly of two types of interphase nodes—multiprotein complexes associated with the plasma membrane that merge together and mature into the precursors of the cytokinetic contractile ring . During the long G2 phase of the cell cycle , seven different interphase node proteins maintain constant concentrations as they accumulate in proportion to cell volume . During mitosis , the total numbers of type 1 node proteins ( cell cycle kinases Cdr1p , Cdr2p , Wee1p , and anillin Mid1p ) are constant even when the nodes disassemble . Quantitative measurements provide strong evidence that both types of nodes have defined sizes and numbers of constituent proteins , as observed for cyto - kinesis nodes . Type 1 nodes assemble in two phases—a burst at the end of mitosis , followed by steady increase during interphase to double the initial number . Type 2 nodes containing Blt1p , Rho - GEF Gef2p , and kinesin Klp8p remain intact throughout the cell cycle and are con - stituents of the contractile ring . They are released from the contractile ring as it disassembles and then associate with type 1 nodes around the equator of the cell during interphase . INTRODUCTION Fission yeast divide by cytokinesis , in which constriction of a con - tractile ring made of actin and myosin ( Stachowiak et al . , 2014 ) and growth of the extracellular septum ( Proctor et al . , 2012 ) form a fur - row at the equator of the cell . The contractile ring forms from clus - ters of cytokinesis proteins called nodes that are associated with the plasma membrane around the middle of the cell ( Vavylonis et al . , 2008 ) . Cytokinesis nodes have stoichiometric proportions of con - stituent proteins ( Wu and Pollard , 2005 ; Laporte et al . , 2011 ) . Super - resolution measurements ( Laplante et al . , 2016b ) and two - color con - focal distance measurements ( Laporte et al . , 2011 ) show that cytokinesis nodes have a regular organization , with myosin - II tails anchored to a compact base near the plasma membrane containing anillin Mid1p and myosin - II heads projecting into the cytoplasm . Mid1p serves as a scaffold for other cytokinesis proteins ( Paoletti and Chang , 2000 ; Celton - Morizur et al . , 2004 ; Wu et al . , 2006 ; Almonacid et al . , 2009 ; Laporte et al . , 2011 ; Saha and Pollard , 2012 ) . During interphase , two types of nodes composed of different proteins appear in distinct regions of the cell and later merge to form cytokinesis nodes ( Akamatsu et al . , 2014 ) . Stationary type 1 nodes containing cell cycle kinases Cdr1p , Cdr2p , and Wee1p form around the middle of cells early during interphase and accumulate anillin Mid1p from the nucleus ( Martin and Berthelot - Grosjean , 2009 ; Moseley et al . , 2009 ) . The type 2 node proteins Blt1p , Gef2p , and Nod1p are concentrated in contractile rings and emerge as dis - crete , punctate structures as the ring disperses ( Moseley et al . , 2009 ; Zhu et al . , 2013 ; Akamatsu et al . , 2014 ) . During interphase , type 2 nodes diffuse along the cell cortex until they are captured by stationary type 1 nodes around the equator after 1 . 5 – 2 h ( Akamatsu et al . , 2014 ) . The combined nodes subsequently accumulate cytoki - nesis proteins early in mitosis ( Moseley et al . , 2009 ; Saha and Pollard , 2012 ) to form cytokinesis nodes . Animal cells may also use node - like clusters of contractile ring proteins as precursors for Monitoring Editor Diane Lidke University of New Mexico Received : Jul 19 , 2016 Revised : Apr 14 , 2017 Accepted : May 15 , 2017 This article was published online ahead of print in MBoC in Press ( http : / / www . molbiolcell . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1091 / mbc .

Akamatsu et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell ( Gef2p , Blt1p , and Klp8p ) were constant during the cell cycle ( Figure 1 , A and B ) , that is , their total numbers per cell increased in proportion to cell size . The scaffold proteins Cdr2p and Blt1p are present at higher concentrations than the other node proteins . Our data confirm previous fluorescence intensity measurements on Mid1p ( Wu and Pollard , 2005 ) using a range of calibration stan - dards and on Cdr2p ( Pan et al . , 2014 ) using the ratio of Cdr2p - GFP to Rlc1p - GFP and the concentration of Rlc1p - GFP ( Wu and Pollard , 2005 ; Supplemental Table S1 ) . Our numbers also agree within a factor of two with measurements by mass spectrometry of Cdr2p , contractile rings ( Straight et al . , 2003 ; Werner et al . , 2007 ; Hickson and O’Farrell , 2008 ; Zhou and Wang , 2008 ; Wollrab et al . , 2016 ; Henson et al . , 2017 ) . Previous work left open four important questions about inter - phase nodes . First , the wide range of fluorescence intensities of in - terphase nodes marked with Cdr2p , Mid1p , Gef2p , or Blt1p ( Laporte et al . , 2011 ; Ye et al . , 2012 ; Zhu et al . , 2013 ; Pan et al . , 2014 ) raised the question of whether interphase nodes are defined units or might be amorphous protein aggregates . It was uncertain whether the compositions of interphase nodes are heterogeneous , whether the presence of variable numbers of unitary structures was obscured by the limited resolution of the confocal microscope , or both . Second , the numbers of nodes during interphase was uncertain . Three studies using confocal microscopy agreed that type 1 nodes marked by Cdr2p – green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) double in num - ber during interphase ( Deng and Moseley , 2013 ; Bhatia et al . , 2014 ; Pan et al . , 2014 ) . However , the reported number of type 1 nodes varied from 10 – 20 in a midfocal plane ( Bhatia et al . , 2014 ) to 25 – 40 ( Pan et al . , 2014 ) or ∼ 52 – 106 in whole cells ( Deng and Moseley , 2013 ) . Third , incomplete information about the cellular concentrations of interphase node proteins ( especially those in type 2 nodes ) left us wondering whether any of their concentrations change during the cell cycle . Quantitative confocal microscopy was used to estimate the number of interphase node proteins including Mid1p ( Wu and Pollard , 2005 ; Coffman et al . , 2011 ; Laporte et al . , 2011 ) , Gef2p and Nod1p ( Zhu et al . , 2013 ) , and Cdr2p ( Pan et al . , 2014 ) in whole cells and interphase nodes . Mass spectrometry showed that the numbers of Cdr2p , Blt1p , and Klp8p were constant around the time of mito - sis , but no measurements were made for the other ∼ 80 % of the cell cycle during interphase ( Carpy et al . , 2014 ) . No quantitative mea - surements were available for Klp8p , Cdr1p , or Wee1p . Fourth , Blt1p , the presumed scaffold for type 2 nodes , is incor - porated into contractile rings , but nodes are not resolved within rings by confocal microscopy ( Moseley et al . , 2009 ; Goss et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore , we did not know whether nodes remain intact or whether Blt1p disperses in contractile rings . We used quantitative confocal microscopy and high - speed fluo - rescence photoactivation localization microscopy ( FPALM ; Huang et al . , 2013 ) of live fission yeast cells to address each of these ques - tions . We investigated the organization and stoichiometry of proteins in interphase nodes across the cell cycle . Both types of measure - ments suggest that interphase nodes are unitary structures that in - crease in number over the cell cycle . The observations also confirmed our speculation ( Akamatsu et al . , 2014 ) that type 2 nodes marked by Blt1p persist as discrete structures within the contractile ring . RESULTS Interphase node proteins accumulate in proportion to cell volume We measured the total numbers per cell of seven interphase node proteins tagged with GFP or monomeric enhanced GFP ( mEGFP ) at the N - or C - terminus by quantitative confocal microscopy ( Figure 1 and Table 1 ) . Six of these proteins were expressed from the genome under the control of their native promoters . mEGFP - Gef2p was overexpressed due to a second promoter upstream of the resis - tance gene ( Zhu et al . , 2013 ) . These tagged strains grew normally ( Supplemental Figure S1 ) . We examined populations of asynchro - nous cells and used cell lengths to estimate cell cycle time . The cellular concentrations of the four type 1 node proteins ( Cdr1p , Cdr2p , Wee1p , and Mid1p ) and three type 2 node proteins FIGURE 1 : Global and local numbers of molecules of interphase node proteins over the cell cycle measured by quantitative fluorescence microscopy ( see Materials and Methods ) .

The x - axis ( relative cell length ) is defined as the cell length scaled relative to the smallest ( 1 ) and largest ( 2 ) cell in the population . Extrapolation of linear fits to x = 1 give the average number of molecules at the cell equator at cell birth . Cells expressing Cdr1p - 3GFP were shorter than wild - type cells ( Martin and Berthelot - Grosjean , 2009 ; Moseley et al . , 2009 ) and so their lengths were scaled independently .

Cells were classified into interphase stages by cell length . Volume 28 November 7 , 2017 Organization of interphase nodes | 3205 Cdr1p dispersed from nodes during mitosis . When expressed at endogenous concentrations , the kinase GFP - Wee1p was present in interphase nodes ( Supplemental Figure S2B ) , but the low signal and its presence at the spindle pole body ( SPB ) precluded accurate measurements of its number in the equatorial broad band . The frac - tion of each type 1 node protein in the broad band of nodes re - mained relatively constant throughout interphase ( 30 – 50 % of the total cellular pool ; Figure 1E ) . Type 2 nodes began the cell cycle concentrated at the new poles created by cytokinesis ( Moseley et al . , 2009 ; Saha and Pollard , 2012 ; Akamatsu et al . , 2014 ; Goss et al . , 2014 ) , and their numbers around the equator were low . During interphase , type 2 nodes moved to the cell equator ( Akamatsu et al . , 2014 ) , where the total numbers of Blt1p and Klp8p increased fourfold to fivefold ( Figure 1D ) . From early G2 to mid G2 , the fraction of Blt1p and Klp8p located in the broad band of nodes increased from 20 to 30 % ( p < 0 . 01 ; Figure 1F ) . Once type 1 and 2 nodes merged around the equator ( Akamatsu et al . , 2014 ) , the ratios of their constituent proteins in nodes re - mained fairly constant ( Table 2 ) . Overexpressed mEGFP - Gef2p did not increase around the equator during interphase , most likely be - cause most of the signal was in the cytoplasm and was included in the measurements of the broad band . We calculated the ratios of molecules in the broad band during late interphase relative to the least abundant protein measured , 1 Cdr1p : ∼ 12 Cdr2p , 5 Mid1p , 2 Klp8p , and 8 Blt1p ( Table 1 ) . These ratios changed little between mid G2 and G2 / M ( Table 2 ) . Number of proteins in interphase nodes is quantized We used quantitative confocal microscopy to measure the fluores - cence intensities of individual nodes of interphase fission yeast cells Blt1p , and Klp8p during the G2 – S interval of the cell cycle ( Carpy et al . , 2014 ) . That study did not report the numbers of these node proteins for the vast majority of interphase , ∼ 80 % of the cell cycle , and the time of interest for our study . Carpy et al . ( 2014 ) examined cells arrested at G2 / M for 5 h , which produced a heterogeneous population of abnormally large cells . They divided all of their num - bers by 3 . 5 , an estimate of the average difference in size of their cell population and wild - type cells . They and Zhu et al . ( 2013 ) re - ported ∼ 2000 Gef2p molecules at the end of G2 , so Gef2p was overexpressed by ∼ 3 . 5 - fold in our cells . Other counts of cytokinesis proteins by mass spectrometry ( Marguerat et al . , 2012 ) differ from fluorescence measurements even by more than an order of magni - tude ( Coffman and Wu , 2014 ; Supplemental Table S1 ) . Interphase node proteins accumulate around the equator during interphase Owing to their accumulation in nodes , the total numbers of type 1 node proteins increased linearly in the broad band around the equa - tor during interphase ( Figure 1 , C and D ) . These measurements are consistent with previous qualitative observations ( Deng and Mose - ley , 2013 ; Pan et al . , 2014 ) . Type 1 nodes form around the equator before cell separation ( Paoletti and Chang , 2000 ; Morrell et al . , 2004 ; Martin and Berthelot - Grosjean , 2009 ; Moseley et al . , 2009 ; Akamatsu et al . , 2014 ) , and so the numbers of type 1 node proteins in the broad band are already high in short early G2 cells . Linear regression fits to the counts of molecules versus cell length allowed us to determine the mean number of molecules in the broad band of nodes ( y - intercepts ) in early interphase : ∼ 2200 Cdr2p , ∼ 800 Mid1p , and 200 Cdr1p .

Molecular Biology of the Cell The foregoing analysis excluded the brightest nodes , which rep - resented at least half of the total nodes . Using larger regions of in - terest to examine a sample of bright nodes that were well separated from each other , we found that their fluorescence intensities were up to 10 times the unitary fluorescence ( Supplemental Figure S2 , A and C – E ) . The fluorescence per unitary node did not change as a function of cell length ( Supplemental Figure S4 ; Pan et al . , 2014 ) . We conclude that nodes are discrete structures with stoichiomet - ric ratios of proteins , but many nodes are too close together to be resolved by confocal microscopy even during interphase . Therefore we turned to superresolution microscopy to test this hypothesis . Superresolution microscopy of interphase nodes We used the photoconvertible fluorescent protein monomeric EOS version 3 . 2 ( mEOS3 . 2 ; Zhang et al . , 2012 ) to tag the C - termini of Cdr2p and Blt1p in the genome , so the native promoter controlled the expression of the fusion proteins . Both strains grew normally ( Supplemental Figure S1 ) . We acquired FPALM images of these cells at 200 frames / s using laser intensities that photoconverted , imaged , and bleached most of the tagged proteins in a field within 50 s ( Huang et al . , 2013 ; Laplante et al . , 2016a ; Supplemental Figure S5 ) . The localization precision was ∼ 35 nm ( Supplemental Figure S5C ) . We imaged nodes from two perspectives—either by focusing in the middle of the cell to obtain side views of nodes along the sides of cells ( Figures 3 , A – C , and 4 , A , B , E , and F ) or by focusing on the cell surface to obtain face views ( Figures 3 , D – G , and 4 , D and F – I ) . High - speed FPALM of cells expressing tagged interphase node proteins showed that both Cdr2p - mEOS3 . 2 and Blt1p - mEOS3 . 2 concentrated in discrete structures < 100 nm in diameter ( Figures 3 , A – C , and 4 , A , B , E , and F ) . The following sections trace the life histories , numbers , locations , and surface densities of interphase nodes throughout the cell cycle . expressing one of seven interphase node proteins tagged with mEGFP at the N - or C - terminus ( Supplemental Table S2 ) . We col - lected z - series of confocal images and measured the fluorescence intensities in five confocal slices separated by 260 nm ( Figure 2A ) . The fluorescence intensities of individual interphase nodes were stable during 2 . 5 min of observation at intervals of 1 or 2 s after cor - recting for the overall photobleaching of the cells ( Supplemental Figure S3 ) . The two presumed scaffold proteins , Cdr2p and Blt1p , are the most abundant proteins in the two types of nodes . Both type 1 and 2 interphase nodes varied widely in fluorescence intensity and size in the confocal microscope ( Figure 2A ; Coffman et al . , 2011 ; Laporte et al . , 2011 ; Ye et al . , 2012 ; Zhu et al . , 2013 ; Pan et al . , 2014 ) . The large , bright , heterogeneous nodes attracted the eye , but most nodes had low intensities and uniform sizes . We used two strategies to measure fluorescence intensity in these nodes . The analysis in Figure 2 was restricted to small nodes that were well sep - arated from other nodes and with their fluorescence included en - tirely in five z - sections . We measured the fluorescence in regions 7 pixels ( ∼ 583 nm ) in diameter encircling these small nodes . Histograms of the fluorescence intensities of the interphase node proteins revealed peaks corresponding to multiples of a uni - tary value ( Figure 2 , B – H ) . Nodes with the unitary fluorescence were the most numerous . For example , in the sampled population of nodes marked with Cdr2p , 57 % were unitary , 28 % were binary , and the remainder had higher fluorescence intensities . Thus some nodes are located so close together that we count them as one node with a multiple of the unitary fluorescence . These fluores - cence intensity histograms were better fitted by multiple Gaussian distributions ( Figure 2 ) than by continuous log - normal distributions ( Supplemental Figure S2 , H – N , and Supplemental Table S3 ) . In cells coexpressing Cdr2p - mCherry and Cdr1p - 3GFP , the fluores - cence intensities per node were correlated in the two channels ( Supplemental Figure S2 , F and G ) .

Volume 28 November 7 , 2017 Organization of interphase nodes | 3209 in two parallel disks of discrete , punctate structures spread along the plasma membrane forming the cleavage furrow ( Figure 4B and Supplemental Figure S5H ) . These arrays of type 2 nodes were sepa - rated by ∼ 155 nm ( Figure 4C ) , corresponding to the thickness of the septum ( Johnson et al . , 1973 ; Cortés et al . , 2012 ) , a distance well within the precision of the FPALM measurement ( Supplemental Figure S5C ) . These data confirm that type 2 nodes emerge from the disassembling contractile ring ( Akamatsu et al . , 2014 ) and associate with the newly expanded plasma membrane lining the cleavage furrow . After the two daughter cells separated , type 2 nodes could be observed as discrete structures at the new cell poles formed by cytokinesis and also spread along the sides of the cells ( Figure 4E ) . These nodes were blurred in the FPALM images ( Figure 4F ) because diffusion coefficients ranged from 10’s to ∼ 1800 nm 2 / s ( Akamatsu et al . , 2014 ) . During interphase , the type 2 node markers accumulated around the equator in discrete structures < 100 nm in diameter , indistinguishable from interphase nodes elsewhere in the cell . Thus the number of type 2 nodes per unit area around the equator in - creased more than threefold ( Figure 4D ) . The positions of each of these objects varied little over the course of 1 min of imaging , which leads to the conclusion that type 2 nodes around the equator were relatively stationary . This behavior is consistent with them being co - localized with and anchored by type 1 nodes at the equator during late interphase ( Akamatsu et al . , 2014 ) . Similar to Cdr2p - mEOS3 . 2 in type 1 nodes , the numbers of de - tections of Blt1p - mEOS3 . 2 per node covered a wide range but dis - tributed into multiples of a unitary number of 28 localizations per node ( Figures 4I , Supplemental Figure S4I , and Supplemental Table S3 ) . Fifty - four percent of type 2 nodes marked with Blt1p were uni - tary , 26 % were binary , and the remainder had more detections . Ra - dial density distributions of the numbers of detections fell off with distance from the center , with 75 % of the detections appearing within 53 nm of the centers ( Figure 4 , G and H ) . We conclude that both type 1 and type 2 nodes are discrete structures with defined sizes and numbers of constituent proteins . Whereas type 1 node proteins cycle between a diffuse cytoplasmic pool ( during mitosis ) and cortical nodes ( during interphase ) , type 2 nodes remain intact throughout the cell cycle . DISCUSSION Our quantitative measurements by confocal microscopy and FPALM support our hypothesis that both types of nodes have defined sizes and numbers of constituent proteins . These unitary type 1 and 2 nodes are relatively uniform over the cell cycle in terms of dimen - sions and appearance ( measured by fluorescence intensity or num - bers of detections ; Supplemental Figure S4 ) . Nodes appear hetero - geneous by confocal microscopy because unitary nodes cannot be resolved in local clusters of two or more nodes . Numbers of nodes Three groups measured the numbers of interphase nodes by confo - cal microscopy . Pan et al . ( 2014 ) reported that Cdr2p - GFP nodes increased in number from 25 to 40 , an acknowledged underesti - mate . Bhatia et al . ( 2014 ) studied the midfocal plane during inter - phase , in which the number of nodes marked with Cdr2 - GFP dou - bled from 10 to 20 , but they did not report the total number of nodes . Deng and Moseley ( 2013 ) collected the most extensive mea - surements of the number of Cdr2p nodes , which increased linearly from ∼ 52 to 106 as cells grew longer during interphase . Our esti - mates are similar . Superresolution microscopy of type 1 interphase nodes After being dispersed in the cytoplasm during mitosis ( Figures 2A and 3Bj ) , Cdr2p - mEOS3 . 2 reappeared in discrete , punctate struc - tures < 100 nm in diameter on the inside of the plasma membrane around the nuclei of both daughter cells ( Figure 3A , a and b ) . Throughout interphase , Cdr2p - mEOS3 . 2 remained localized to these discrete structures distributed in a broad band around the cell equator . These images of type 1 nodes were sharp because type 1 nodes have low diffusion coefficients ( Akamatsu et al . , 2014 ) and moved less than the precision of the imaging method during the time of acquisition . These punctate structures appeared similar in side views ( Figure 3 , A – C ) and face views ( Figure 3E ) . The appearance of Cdr2p - mEOS3 . 2 in these new nodes was indistinguishable from that in type 1 nodes later during interphase , so we did not detect any intermediate forms . The numbers of localized detections of Cdr2p per node covered a wide range but clustered in discrete peaks corresponding to multi - ples of a unitary number of 36 detections per node ( Figure 3G ) , simi - lar to our confocal microscopy observations ( Supplemental Figure S4I and Supplemental Table S3 ) . In the sampled population of nodes marked with Cdr2p ( all discrete spots with Gaussian distributions of detections ) , 58 % were unitary , 17 % were binary , and the remainder had higher numbers of detections . Thus many nodes were located so close to neighbors that they were not resolved even by superresolu - tion microscopy . The numbers of localized detections per node did not change as a function of cell length ( Supplemental Figure S4H ) . We assessed the spatial distribution of Cdr2p - mEOS3 . 2 detec - tions within nodes with unitary numbers of detections ( < 55 detec - tions per node ) by measuring the radial distance of each detection from the center of mass of the node . The numbers of detections declined radially from the center , with 75 % within 51 nm of the center ( Figure 3F ) . All of these unitary nodes were similar in size ( Supplemental Figure S4 , J – M ) . The local densities ( Supplemental Figure S6 ) of nodes imaged around the equator by FPALM varied from cell to cell but increased modestly during interphase ( Figure 3D ) . This is consistent with previ - ous measurements by confocal microscopy , which showed that the numbers of nodes ( Deng and Moseley , 2013 ; Pan et al . , 2014 ) in - creased during interphase faster than the increase in the width of the broad band of nodes ( Bhatia et al . , 2014 ; Pan et al . , 2014 ) . Superresolution microscopy of type 2 interphase nodes Blt1p - mEOS3 . 2 appeared in discrete , punctate structures < 100 nm in diameter near the plasma membrane throughout the cell cycle ( Figure 4 , A and E ) . The appearance of these nodes was similar in side views ( Figure 4 , A , B , E , and F ) and face views ( Figure 4G ) . However , clusters of detections of Blt1p - mEOS3 . 2 in type 2 nodes were larger near the cell poles than around the equator ( Figure 4F ) . Temporal color coding showed that some clusters of Blt1p - mEOS3 . 2 moved on a scale of hundreds of nanometers during data acquisition , giving rise to streaks or rainbow colors . Such motions are expected from the high diffusion coefficients of type 2 nodes at the tips of cells ( Aka - matsu et al . , 2014 ) . FPALM showed for the first time that Blt1p forms discrete struc - tures in contractile rings during cytokinesis ( Figure 4A ) . These clus - ters of Blt1p - mEOS3 . 2 in contractile rings were sometimes blurred but were generally indistinguishable in size and shape from inter - phase type 2 nodes ( Figure 4 , A and E ) . These Blt1p nodes are spaced too closely in contractile rings to be resolved by confocal microscopy . Once a dividing cell had constricted its contractile ring and formed a septum in the cleavage furrow , Blt1p - mEOS3 . 2 remained 3210 | M . Akamatsu et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell We find that type 1 nodes assemble in two phases : a burst at the end of mitosis assembles about half of these nodes , followed by steady increase in numbers during interphase to double the initial number . Type 1 nodes appear quickly at the end of the eclipse phase ( Figure 3 ) , either assembling on the plasma membrane or forming in the cytoplasm before binding to the plasma membrane . Pan and Chang ( 2014 ) proposed that type 1 nodes grow by accre - tion of smaller Cdr2p assemblies moving along the inner surface of the plasma membrane . Such small , fast - moving units cannot be de - tected by live - cell FPALM because they generate too few single - molecule detections . Mid1p accumulates in type 1 nodes , which then mature by merging with type 2 nodes before accumulating cytokinesis pro - teins . Thus the mechanisms concentrating stationary type 1 nodes around the equator determine the distribution of type 2 nodes and site of the cleavage furrow . Mid1p comes along as a passen - ger on type 1 nodes rather than determining their location . In ad - dition , Mid1p has an uncharacterized influence on the location of cytokinesis nodes because they are not confined to the equator in mid1 ∆ cells ( Daga and Chang , 2005 ; Wu et al . , 2006 ; Almonacid et al . , 2009 ; Laporte et al . , 2011 ; Lee and Wu , 2012 ; Saha and Pollard , 2012 ) . Life cycle of type 2 nodes Type 2 nodes remain intact throughout the cell cycle , including time in the contractile ring . Confocal microscopy established that Blt1p is associated with cytokinesis structures across the entire cell cycle , in - cluding interphase nodes , cytokinesis nodes , and the contractile ring ( Moseley et al . , 2009 ; Akamatsu et al . , 2014 ; Goss et al . , 2014 ) . However , the discrete node structure is lost to view during mitosis , when the fluorescence in confocal images is spread uniformly throughout the contractile ring . This raised a question about the or - ganization of Blt1p in the contractile ring . The 10 - fold improvement in resolution provided by FPALM has provided a clear answer . Blt1p remains in compact foci the size of interphase nodes within the contractile ring . The shape and size of these Blt1p loci are similar to those of cytokinesis nodes in contractile rings ( Laplante et al . , 2016b ) . As the ring constricts and disassembles , Blt1p nodes remain along the cleavage furrow and can be resolved by FPALM ( Figure 4 and Supplemental Figure S5 ) . Once the nodes spread away from the division site they can again be resolved by confocal microscopy . Formation of cytokinesis nodes Cytokinesis nodes form by a series of reactions . First , diffusing type 2 nodes encounter and merge with stationary type 1 nodes , which establish the location of cleavage , as shown by mutations that alter the distribution of type 2 nodes ( Celton - Morizur et al . , 2006 ; Padte et al . , 2006 ; Moseley et al . , 2009 ; Lee and Wu , 2012 ) . The unitary nature of interphase nodes suggests that cytokinesis nodes form by docking of fully formed type 1 and type 2 nodes , a hypothesis for testing by further experimentation . Less likely , type 2 node proteins may add to type 1 nodes by accretion , as observed for Myo2 adding to cytokinesis nodes ( Vavylonis et al . , 2008 ) . The ∼ 35 - nm resolution of our FPALM images did not allow us to test this docking hypoth - esis or resolve any substructure . Second , Mid1p transfers from type 1 to type 2 nodes before the type 1 node proteins disperse during mitosis ( Morrell et al . , 2004 ; Martin and Berthelot - Grosjean , 2009 ; Moseley et al . , 2009 ; Saha and Pollard , 2012 ; Guzman - Vendrell et al . , 2013 ; Jourdain et al . , 2013 ; Zhu et al . , 2013 ; Akamatsu et al . , 2014 ; Goss et al . , 2014 ) . Gef2p and binding partner Nod1p likely aid in the transfer , as Gef2p We used Deng’s counts of nodes versus cell length ( Deng , per - sonal communication ) to calculate the numbers of unitary nodes . Our FPALM observations show that the wide range of intensities of Cdr2p nodes in confocal micrographs comes from many confocal spots containing multiple unitary nodes ( Figure 2 , A and B ) . About 57 % of confocal “nodes” are unitary , 28 % have two unitary nodes , and 15 % have three or more unitary nodes . Given these ratios , the number of unitary type 1 nodes is ∼ 80 in early G2 and ∼ 160 at the end of interphase . This number of unitary type 1 nodes at the end of interphase is similar to the ∼ 140 unitary cytokinesis nodes that Laplante et al . ( 2016b ) measured by FPALM , given that 75 – 80 % of type 1 nodes associate with type 2 nodes ( Akamatsu et al . , 2014 ) and presumably mature to cytokinesis nodes . Compositions of interphase nodes We used this new estimate of node numbers and our measurements of the numbers of molecules in a broad band of nodes to calculate ( see Materials and Methods ) the approximate numbers of molecules in unitary interphase nodes at the end of G2 phase ( Table 1 ) . Like cytokinesis nodes ( Laplante et al . , 2016b ) , mature type 1 nodes each have ∼ 10 molecules of Mid1p . Our estimates of 10 Mid1p mol - ecules and 30 Cdr2p molecules per node are lower than previous measurements of Cdr2p ( Pan et al . , 2014 ) and Mid1p ( Laporte et al . , 2011 ) by confocal microscopy because the diffraction - limited spots in those studies were not always unitary nodes . Isolated Blt1p forms tetramers ( Goss et al . , 2014 ) , and so the 5 Blt1p tetramers may each associate with single copies of Klp8p . Gef2p and Nod1p are also present in stoichiometric ratios ( Zhu et al . , 2013 ) . Cdr2p and Blt1p are the leading candidates to be the core pro - teins of type 1 and 2 interphase nodes . They are the most abundant proteins in their respective nodes and are required for other node proteins to assemble ( Almonacid et al . , 2009 ; Martin and Berthelot - Grosjean , 2009 ; Moseley et al . , 2009 ) . Both types of interphase nodes are closely associated with the plasma membrane . Multiple candidates are available to link inter - phase nodes to plasma membrane lipids : in type 1 nodes , Cdr2p has a C - terminal KA1 domain ( Moravcevic et al . , 2010 ; Rincon et al . , 2014 ) and Mid1p has both PH and C2 domains ( Celton - Morizur et al . , 2004 ; Sun et al . , 2015 ) , and Blt1p in type 2 nodes binds phos - pholipids ( Guzman - Vendrell et al . , 2013 ) . Life cycle of type 1 nodes The numbers of each interphase node protein are constant during mitosis ( Carpy , 2014 ) , but during interphase , each accumulates in proportion to cell volume . In parallel , the numbers of molecules of type 1 node proteins increase around the middle of the cell due to an increase in the number of nodes , as the numbers of molecules per node ( proportional to intensity or number of detections ) do not change over the cell cycle ( Supplemental Figure S4 ; Bhatia et al . , 2014 ; Pan et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore the biochemical state of the cell rather than gene ex - pression controls the assembly of nodes . For example , type 1 node proteins cycle between a diffuse cytoplasmic pool ( during mitosis ) and cortical nodes ( during interphase ) . The septation initiation net - work ( SIN ) signaling pathway disperses type 1 node proteins into the cytoplasm during mitosis ( Morrell et al . , 2004 ; Martin and Ber - thelot - Grosjean , 2009 ; Moseley et al . , 2009 ; Akamatsu et al . , 2014 ; Pu et al . , 2015 ; Supplemental Figure S3 ) , and the decline of SIN activity allows type 1 nodes to reassemble around the equators of the daughter cells at the end of mitosis ( Pu et al . , 2015 ) . The pro - teins recycle because Cdr2p nodes remain in cells treated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cyclohexamide ( Pan et al . , 2014 ) . Volume 28 November 7 , 2017 Organization of interphase nodes | 3211 Confocal microscopy We imaged cells on gelatin pads in growth chambers containing EMM5S medium and 100 µM n - propyl gallate at 25°C . We used an inverted microscope ( Olympus , IX - 71 ) with a 100 × / 1 . 4 numeri - cal aperture Plan Apochromat objective ( Olympus ) fitted with a spinning - disk confocal head ( CSU - X1 ; Yokogawa Corporation of America ) , electron - multiplying charge - coupled device camera ( iXon 897 ; Andor Technology ) , argon - ion lasers ( Melles Griot ) , acousto - optical tunable filters ( Gooch and Housego ) , and dichroic mirrors and filters ( Semrock ) . Images were acquired using Andor IQ2 software . For still images , we took z - series of twenty - one 260 - nm confocal slices encompassing 5 . 2 µm , which covered the entire cell . For time - lapse imaging , we took z - series of three 400 - nm confocal slices clos - est to the coverslip at 1 - or 2 - s intervals for ∼ 200 s . Data analysis Image correction . We corrected for uneven illumination and camera offset in the confocal micrographs by imaging slides of purified monomeric yellow fluorescent protein and using automated image correction software ( McCormick et al . , 2013 ) . We corrected for uneven illumination in three dimensions , which also corrects for the ∼ 40 % difference in fluorescence intensity between the top and the bottom of the 3 . 5 - µm - diameter cells due to spherical aberrations , the difference in refractive index between the coverslip and sample . After correction , the fluorescence intensity per node was similar in nodes at the top and bottom of the cell . We wrote custom image analysis software in ImageJ64 and MATLAB ( R2015a ) to semiautomatically make measurements and perform calculations on the confocal stacks of images using user - defined regions of interest . ImageJ software was written using JEdit ( 1 . 0 ) , and some functions were adapted from published software ( McCormick et al . , 2013 ; Akamatsu et al . , 2014 ) . We corrected the final fluorescence intensity values based on the fluorescent protein used : mEGFP is 1 . 1 times brighter than GFP ( Coffman et al . , 2011 ) and 3 × GFP is three times brighter than GFP ( Wu and Pollard , 2005 ) . For the high – copy number calibration strain fim1 - mEGFP , we reduced the electron multiplication ( EM ) gain from 300 to 100 to maintain the camera intensity values within the linear range , and scaled the resultant values accordingly . The EM gain was linear up to a value of 300 . Analysis of asynchronous cells . We used cell length as a proxy for cell cycle time ( Baumgärtner and Tolic - Nørrelykke , 2009 ; Akamatsu et al . , 2014 ) . We subdivided the 4 – 5 h of interphase into five stages based cell on morphology or length : early G2 cells were < 8 . 5 µm long , mid G2 cells were 8 . 5 – 10 . 5 µm long , late G2 cells were 10 . 6 – 12 . 5 µm long , and G2 / M cells were > 12 . 5 µm long . Cdr1p - 3GFP cells are shorter than wild - type cells ( Martin and Berthelot - Grosjean , 2009 ; Moseley et al . , 2009 ) , and so we defined these stages as for wild type minus 1 . 5 µm ( Akamatsu et al . , 2014 ) . Wee1p - GFP and GFP - Wee1p cells are longer than wild type cells , so we define these stages as for wild type plus 5 . 5 µm . For Figures 1 , 3 , and 4 , we report the relative length of cells , defined as the difference ratio between current cell length and shortest cell in the population divided by the difference between the longest and shortest cells in the population . The values range from 1 at cell birth to 2 during mitosis . The y - intercept of these plots at x = 1 provides a measure of the mean number of molecules in the region of interest at cell birth . We scaled the length values for Cdr1p - 3GFP cells independently because their mean length differs from that of wild - type cells . immunoprecipitates with Mid1p and the three proteins reside stoi - chiometrically in nodes ( Ye et al . , 2012 ; Guzman - Vendrell et al . , 2013 ; Zhu et al . , 2013 ) . Then cytokinetic nodes slowly accumulate other cytokinesis proteins , resulting in ratios of one Mid1p molecule for each myosin - II Myo2 dimer , F - BAR protein Cdc15p dimer , and IQGAP Rng2p dimer ( Wu and Pollard , 2005 ; Laporte et al . , 2011 ; Laplante et al . , 2016b ) . Based on the total numbers of these mole - cules around the equator and the numbers of unitary nodes counted by FPALM , cytokinesis nodes have ∼ 10 copies of these units . Finally , forces produced by myosin on actin filaments condense cytokinesis nodes into the contractile ring ( Vavylonis et al . , 2008 ) . Type 2 nodes containing Blt1p are platforms for assembly of cy - tokinesis nodes and ultimately the contractile ring . They are the only component of the contractile ring that remains intact throughout the cell cycle , so it is remarkable that cells lacking Blt1p are nearly normal , with only modest delays in the constriction of the contractile ring ( Moseley et al . , 2009 ; Zhu et al . , 2013 ; Goss et al . , 2014 ) . This indicates that cells have a reliable mechanism to back up the con - nections that Blt1p normally makes between proteins and the plasma membrane . For example , if mutations cdr2 ∆ or blt1 ∆ disrupt the mechanisms that normally target proteins to interphase nodes , the F - BAR protein Cdc15p slowly recruits node proteins , including Gef2p and Nod1p , to the contractile ring around or after the time of SPB separation ( Ye et al . , 2012 ; Zhu et al . , 2013 ) . This interdepen - dence of redundant pathways explains the strong negative genetic interaction between mutations of cdc15 and blt1 ( Goss et al . , 2014 ) . Type 2 interphase node proteins may be some of many proteins that recruit and retain Mid1p , perhaps in relationship to its phosphoryla - tion status during mitosis . Fits of our histograms of fluorescence intensity or FPALM detec - tions per node suggest that interphase nodes are discrete macro - molecular assemblies ( quantized distributions ) rather than amor - phous aggregates of proteins ( continuous log - normal distributions ; Supplemental Figures S2 , H – N , and S5 , I – J , and Supplemental Table S3 ) . A unitary structure for nodes is consistent with the stoichiometric ratios of proteins in nodes ( Supplemental Figure S2G and Table 1 ; Coffman et al . , 2011 ; Laporte et al . , 2011 ; Zhu et al . , 2013 ) , the nar - row distribution of node sizes ( Figures 3E and 4H ; Laplante et al . , 2016b ) , and defined positions of proteins within nodes ( Laporte et al . , 2011 ; Laplante et al . , 2016b ) . This architectural information serves as the foundation for mechanistic studies of the internal orga - nization of interphase nodes and their functions in cytokinesis . MATERIALS AND METHODS Strain construction We created strains of Schizosaccharomyces pombe with genetically encoded fluorescent proteins using standard PCR - based gene - target - ing methods ( Bähler et al . , 1998 ; Laplante et al . , 2016a ) and plasmids PFA6a - mEGFP - kanMX6 PFA6a - 3GFP and pFA6a - mEos3 . 2 - kanMX6 to insert genes for fluorescent protein mEGFP 3GFP or mEOS3 . 2 up - stream or downstream of the open reading frame in the endogenous chromosomal locus ( Supplemental Table S2 ) . We constructed the other strains by genetic crosses to laboratory stock strains . Some fluorescent fusion proteins were not fully functional in cells . cdr1 - 3GFP cells were shorter than wild - type cells ( Martin and Berthelot - Grosjean , 2009 ; Moseley et al . , 2009 ; Akamatsu et al . , 2014 ) , and GFP - wee1 cells were longer than wild - type cells ( Mose - ley et al . , 2009 ; Supplemental Figure S1B ) . The additional promoter in the kanMX6 cassette increased the cellular expression of N - termi - nally labeled mEGFP - Gef2 by approximately three to four times ( Zhu et al . , 2013 ) . The addition of mEOS3 . 2 to the C - terminus of Cdr2p or Blt1p did not affect cell growth ( Supplemental Figure S1B ) . 3212 | M . Akamatsu et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell using a nonlinear least squares method . We used equations for the sum of three or four Gaussian distributions . We set the amplitudes , SDs , and means for each of the Gaussian distributions as free pa - rameters , with constraints that the parameters be positive . We set parameter starting values for the fit as integers within the order of magnitude observed for each distribution . Comparison of fit quality . We calculated the F statistic to compare the quality of the fits between multiple Gaussian distributions and a log - normal distribution for each histogram in Figures 2 , 3G , and 4I ( Supplemental Figures S2 and S4 and Supplemental Table S3 ) . The F statistic is the ratio of the sum of squared errors between the two fits normalized by the number of degrees of freedom ( where a higher F value corresponds to a better fit for the first model ) . Analysis of time - lapse images . To analyze time - lapse fluorescence images of nodes , we used a simplified version of software that tracks actin patches ( Berro and Pollard , 2014 ) . Regions were selected man - ually , automatically recentered at each time point with a custom algorithm using a Gaussian kernel ( Berro and Pollard , 2014 ) , and then plotted with custom MATLAB software . For nodes that changed in fluorescence intensity over the course of imaging , we checked that the maximum fluorescence stayed in the middle slice for the duration of the imaging . We measured the background fluorescence over time from 10 – 20 peripheral regions containing no discrete fluorescence . We averaged the fluorescence measurements over time and between regions within a cell to gen - erate a background measurement for each cell . The value of the background varied by 6 – 8 % in regions within the cell ( coefficient of variation 0 . 05 – 0 . 08 ) and varied by 5 % between cells in an asynchro - nous population . We previously used these time - lapse images to report the diffusion coefficients of nodes using their positions over time ( Akamatsu et al . , 2014 ) , but we did not report their fluores - cence intensities over time . Analysis of node number and estimate of molecules per node . We used raw unbinned data from Deng and Moseley ( 2013 ) to calculate the number of unitary type 1 nodes . Their measurements of type 1 node number by confocal microscopy are the most reli - able and agree with our estimates by FPALM , using average sur - face density measurements and assumptions about the surface area of the broad band of nodes . We used their linear regression to estimate that the measured number of nodes increased from 52 ( 7 . 5 - µm cells ) to 106 ( 14 . 8 - µm cells ) . We used the ratios of unitary versus multiple nodes from Figure 2A to convert this number to the number of unitary nodes . We divided our measurements of the numbers of molecules per broad band by these measurements of node number to estimate the numbers of molecules per node . FPALM We imaged cells on gelatin pads in growth chambers containing EMM5S and 100 µM n - propyl gallate at 25°C . We imaged cells with a custom - built single - molecule switching microscope ( Laplante et al . , 2016a ) with the following modifications : fluorescence emission from mEos3 . 2 was collected by the objective and separated from the excitation light by a dichroic mirror ( FF01 - 408 / 504 / 581 / 667 / 762 ; Semrock ) and a bandpass filter ( ET605 / 70 ; Chroma ) before being focused onto the sensor chip of the scientific complementary metal - oxide semiconductor ( sCMOS ) camera . FPALM acquisition . We illuminated the cells with 3 – 8 kW / cm 2 from the 561 - nm laser for 10 s before acquisition to bleach Calculating cellular concentrations . We counted molecules using a calibration curve that related fluorescence intensity to number of mol - ecules based on quantitative immunoblots ( Wu and Pollard , 2005 ; Mc - Cormick et al . , 2013 ) . This calibration method agrees with orthogonal methods of measuring molecules within ∼ 30 % ( Coffman et al . , 2011 ; Lawrimore et al . , 2011 ; McCormick et al . , 2013 ) . We circled cells man - ually and measured the fluorescence summed over all 21 260 - nm slices . From the cellular regions , we extracted the cell length ( Feret’s diameter , defined as the longest distance between two points in the region ) , area , and sum fluorescence intensity for analysis . We esti - mated the cytoplasmic volume for each cell based on its area , the av - erage area of the cells measured , and the assumption that the average fission yeast cell cytoplasm has a volume of 27 µm 3 ( Wu and Pollard , 2005 ) . These concentration measurements are the total number of molecules per cell divided by the scaled estimate of cellular volume . Calculating the number of molecules per region . We measured the fluorescence in a region the width of the cell and containing > 95 % of the fluorescence of the object of interest : 1 µm wide for the contractile ring and 4 µm wide for the equatorial band of nodes . To account for cytoplasmic and cellular background , we measured fluo - rescence from a region containing the original measurement region that was two times greater in area or the length of the cell if twice the original region exceeded the cell length ( Wu et al . , 2008 ) . For cells in early interphase with nodes near the cell tips , this back - ground measurement did not cover the nodes concentrated at the new cell tip but sometimes included other nodes scattered outside the broad band of nodes . We could not measure the number of molecules of Wee1p per broad band due to the low signal of GFP - Wee1p in nodes relative to background and its localization to the spindle pole body . The fraction of proteins in broad band ( Figure 1 , E and F ) is defined as the number of molecules per broad band di - vided by the number of molecules per cell on a per - cell basis . We used a two - sample Kolmogorov – Smirnov test to evaluate the sig - nificance of the increase in the fraction of molecules per broad band between early and mid G2 ( Figure 1F ) . Calculating fluorescence intensity per node . We measured the fluorescence intensity per node as the sum of fluorescence intensity in five consecutive 260 - nm confocal slices closest to the coverslip . We made measurements of nodes containing fluorescence in at least three consecutive slices that did not have fluorescence in the adja - cent slices outside the five - slice stack . We measured background fluorescence intensity from cytoplasmic regions in the cell ( Sirotkin et al . , 2010 ; Coffman and Wu , 2012 ) . For Supplemental Figure S2 , C – E , we measured the total fluorescence within continuous regions corresponding to a node or a clump of nodes , as depicted in Supple - mental Figure S2A . This included regions that contained additional fluorescence outside the five - slice stack used for quantification . For Supplemental Figure S2 , F and G , we compared the fluorescence intensity of nodes marked by Cdr2p - mCherry and Cdr1p - 3xGFP in the same cell . We generated regions of interest surrounding diffrac - tion - limited spots that contained the fluorescence of nodes in each channel . We report the intensity in each channel subtracted by the mean cytoplasmic background fluorescence in the field . To generate the background fluorescence measurements in Figure 2 , we mea - sured the fluorescence intensity for each background region of inter - est , subtracted by all the other background regions in that cell . We plot the mean ± SD of this background fluorescence value . Fitting Gaussian distributions to histograms . We used the MAT - LAB curve - fitting tool to fit each histogram in Figures 2 , 3G , and 4I Volume 28 November 7 , 2017 Organization of interphase nodes | 3213 REFERENCES Akamatsu M , Berro J , Pu K - M , Tebbs IR , Pollard TD ( 2014 ) .

To minimize premature photoactivation and bleaching , we found the correct fo - cal plane by bright - field microscopy . We focused on the middle of a field of cells in bright field to image cells in a longitudinal section ∼ 400 nm thick . To image the surface of cells closest to the coverslip , we imaged regions 1 . 6 µm closer to the coverslip than the medial section . Software used to construct superresolution images We performed data analysis and superresolution image recon - struction using sCMOS - specific single - molecule localization algo - rithms ( Huang et al . , 2013 ) . Briefly , we first corrected the raw data frames for the camera offset and gain . After single - molecule iden - tification from the calibrated images , we cropped images of the molecules ( 7 × 7 pixels ) and used maximum - likelihood estimation of two - dimensional ( 2D ) Gaussian fits to obtain the position , pho - ton number , and background information . We used a rejection algorithm based on the log - likelihood ratio metric to remove non - convergent fits or overlapping fluorescence signals from multiple emitters . Localization uncertainty estimates were determined using Cramér – Rao lower bound with the sCMOS likelihood function . To reconstruct super - resolution images , we binned the localization es - timates into 2D histogram images with 5 . 15 × 5 . 15 nm pixel size . To aid visualization , each resulting image was convolved with a 2D Gaussian kernel with σ = 1 . 5 pixels . Analysis of reconstructed FPALM nodes Calculating local density of nodes . We generated Voronoi diagrams ( also called Voronoi tessellations ) to calculate the local density of nodes from FPALM images of cells . We used ImageJ to manually select all discrete spots in the image with regions of interest 231 nm in diameter and record the spots’ x - and y - positions within each cell . We wrote a MATLAB program to record the position of each node , length of the cell , and its long - axis angle relative to the x - axis . The program retained nodes with ≥ 14 detections for further analysis . The program calls the function “voronoin . m” to generate a Voronoi diagram for all of the nodes in each cell . The Voronoi diagram partitions the cell surface into polygons each containing one node . For a given node and its polygon , each point on the polygon is closer to that node than to any other node . The area of each polygon is the inverse of the local density of that node . To account for overlapping nodes , we divided the area of the polygon by integer values corresponding to the number of unitary nodes as determined from the numbers of detections ( Figures 3G and 4I ) . To account for cell edges , the boundary was periodic and rotated according to the cell axis angle . For the plots in Figures 3D and 4F , we calculated the mean node density for the middle 1 . 8 µm of the cell’s length for consistency with confocal measurements . The slopes and r 2 values in these figures were similar if the middle region was 4 µm long . Calculating number of detections per node and radial distance . We manually selected all discrete regions in 50 - s reconstructions of FPALM images and saved the regions for analysis using the al - gorithms described in Laplante ( 2016a ) . Briefly , for each region , we made 2D histograms of the detections within the region with a pixel size of 2 nm and identified the radial symmetry center ( Parthasarathy , 2012 ) of each region . We fitted radially symmetric 2D Gaussian distributions to each FPALM node using a maximum - likelihood method and retained nodes for further analysis based on the quality of the fit . For nodes retained after the foregoing filtering step , we mea - sured the numbers of detections per region and report these values as histograms in Figures 3 and 4 . We fitted three Gaussian distribu - tions as explained for the histograms of fluorescence per node to identify the number of detections corresponding to unitary , double , or triple nodes . For nodes within the unitary number of detections ( ≤ 55 detec - tions for Cdr2p or ≤ 50 detections for Blt1p ) , we measured the dis - tance of each detection from the node center ( obtained by the Gaussian fit ) and report histograms of the radial distances , with each distance bin normalized by the value of the radius . We plot the cumu - lative distributions of these histograms and report the radial distance that contains at least 75 % of localizations , as well as the full - width at half - maximum , defined as two times the 50th percentile of radial dis - tances . These two measurements are not directly comparable be - cause each radial distance bin occupies a different amount of area . 3214 | M . Akamatsu et al .
