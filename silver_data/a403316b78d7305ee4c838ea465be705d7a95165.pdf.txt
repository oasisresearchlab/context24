UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME , NOTRE DAME , INDIANA 46556 MIDWEST MECHANICS SEMINAR SPEAKER : Professor David J . Steigmann Department of Mechanical Engineering University of California at Berkeley Berkeley , California TOPIC : BOUNDARY - VALUE PROBLEMS IN THE THEORY OF LIPID MEMBRANES DATE : TIME : PLACE : Tuesday , March 2 , 2010 3 : 30 p . m . 138 DeBartolo Hall ABSTRACT The mechanics of lipid bilayers is discussed in the context of the theory of elastic shells with fluid symmetry . New contact conditions are developed for lipid membranes interacting with curved substrates along their edges . These include the anchoring conditions familiar from liquidÂ­ crystal theory and accommodate non - uniform membranes and non - uniform adhesion between a bulk fluid or membrane and a rigid substrate . The theory is illustrated through explicit solutions and numerical simulations . NOTE : Ifyou are interested in meeting individually with Prof . Steigmann , please contact Evelyn at 631 ~ 5431 .
