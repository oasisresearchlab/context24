Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) has had a significant impact on hospitals , including the occupational health departments in charge of handling healthcare worker ( HCW ) staffing during high rates of exposure and infection of HCWs . HCWs who were exposed to a patient or community member infected with SARS - CoV - 2 were required to isolate from work for a minimum of 14 days from the date of exposure . Aims This study was aimed to assess the relative risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection following different types of workplace and community exposures . Methods We analyzed the details of workplace and community exposures of HCWs to SARS - CoV - 2 at Montefiore Medical Center in New York between 22 June 2020 and 22 November 2020 . Results Of 562 HCW SARS - CoV - 2 exposures analyzed , 218 were from the community and 345 were from the workplace . Twenty - nine per cent of community exposures resulted in infection , which was sig - nificantly greater than workplace exposure infection ( 2 % ) . Household community exposures re - sulted in a larger frequency of infection than non - household community exposures . Of the seven infections after workplace exposures , five had qualifying exposures to a co - worker and two were exposed to an infected patient during a non - aerosolized procedure . Conclusions HCW exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 continues to present staffing challenges to healthcare systems . Even with deviations from standard personal protective equipment protocol , workplace exposures resulted in low frequencies of infection . In our study , the primary source of HCW infection was exposure in the community . Our findings support investing in efforts to educate around continued masking and social distancing in the community in addition to interventions targeted at addressing vaccine hesitancy .

Introduction Avoiding transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) remains a pri - ority for all healthcare settings . Infection prevention measures like proper personal protective equipment ( PPE ) adherence , hand hygiene and contact tracing to identify and mitigate high - risk exposures remain a central strategy to fight coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) . The New York State Department of Health ( NYSDOH ) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) have defined criteria for ex - posures in the workplace and in the community [ 1 , 2 ] . The goal of this study was to analyse the SARS - CoV - 2 exposures of healthcare workers ( HCWs ) at a large , urban , academic medical centre to better understand the likelihood of subsequently testing positive for SARS - CoV - 2 . Page 2 of 4 OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE Methods This retrospective cohort study analysed all commu - nity and workplace SARS - CoV - 2 exposures reported to Occupational Health and Safety ( OHS ) at Montefiore Medical Center in New York between 22 June 2020 and 22 November 2020 . Before June 2020 , HCWs were not quarantined after all exposures due to critical staffing issues . After November 2020 , the exposure quarantine duration was shortened , there was increased community interaction during holidays , and vaccination began . Exposures reported to OHS by HCWs and additional results of workplace contact tracing investigations by Infection Prevention and Control ( IPC ) were included in the analysis . The details of all exposures were docu - mented in an OHS REDCap database hosted at Albert Einstein College of Medicine [ 3 ] . All HCWs were offered diagnostic testing and were required to quarantine at home for a minimum of 14 days following the exposure regardless of symptoms . This study considered only diag - nostic testing completed within 14 days of exposure . The NYSDOH generally aligns with the CDC on exposure definitions , but the definitions changed a few times and the NYSDOH was ultimately more conserva - tive during our study period [ 1 , 2 , 4 ] . Exposures were de - fined as being within 6 feet of an infected individual for greater than 10 min over a 24 - h period [ 2 ] . Community exposures use these criteria regardless of masking status . Workplace exposures were stratified into four workplace categories : ( i ) exposures from aerosol - generating pro - cedures ( AGPs ) , ( ii ) exposures from patients without an AGP ( non - AGP ) , ( iii ) exposures between HCWs who share a workspace and ( iv ) exposures between HCWs over a break or mealtime . Patient AGP exposures were defined as the HCW not wearing a gown , gloves , eye protection and / or N95 respirator for any amount of time during patient care . The remaining exposure types were when the HCW or index case was not wearing a mask . If the index case was not masked , but the HCW had both a mask and eye protection , the HCW was not considered exposed [ 1 ] . Fischer’s exact tests were used to compare percentages of infection between exposure categories . All analyses were performed using Stata ( version 11 . 2 , StataCorp , College Station , TX , USA ) . This study was approved by the affiliated Institutional Review Board . Results A total of 562 HCWs met study criteria : 218 ( 39 % ) had community exposures and 344 ( 61 % ) had workplace exposures . Sixty - four ( 29 % ) of the community exposures tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 in the 14 days after exposure . Of the community exposures , 129 ( 59 % ) were from household members . When exposed to a household member , 42 ( 33 % ) tested positive versus 22 ( 25 % ) of 89 community exposures to non - household members ( Table 1 ) . Seven ( 2 % ) workplace exposures tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 within 14 days following exposure . Of the workplace exposures , 59 ( 17 % ) were ‘patient AGP’ , of which none had positive tests , and 106 ( 31 % ) were ‘patient non - AGP’ , of which 2 ( 2 % ) had positive tests . Key learning points What is already known about this subject : • Increased duration and proximity to people with COVID - 19 is known to be a risk for COVID - 19 . • Healthcare workers’ use of personal protective equipment and hand hygiene decrease the risk of COVID - 19 . • Studies show an increased risk of infection for healthcare workers caring for COVID - 19 patients and that proper personal protective equipment is effective in preventing transmission . • It is less clear which specific exposures put healthcare workers at greatest risk now that advances were made in availability of personal protective equipment , testing and contact tracing . What this study adds : • COVID - 19 exposures at the healthcare workplace led to a much lower frequency of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission than expected . • Community exposures to COVID - 19 led to a much higher frequency of SARS - CoV - 2 positivity than exposures from the healthcare workplace . What impact this may have on practice or policy : • Healthcare facilities should focus efforts on mitigating community risk for their healthcare workers , including programs to overcome vaccine hesitancy and education around community spread . • Workplace exposures continue to happen even with increased availability of PPE and enhanced knowledge around transmission . • Continued efforts to promote vaccination , universal masking and social distancing during times where SARS - CoV - 2 is prevalent remain necessary . F . A . GANZ - LORD ET AL . : SARS - COV - 2 EXPOSURES AMONG HEALTHCARE WORKERS Page 3 of 4 Fifty - nine ( 17 % ) were ‘shared workspace , ’ of which four ( 7 % ) had positive PCR tests . One hundred twenty - one ( 35 % ) were ‘meals or break’ , of which one ( 1 % ) had a positive PCR test ( Table 1 ) . SARS - CoV - 2 positivity following workplace expos - ures when the specific PPE is not used is presented in Table 2 . The two HCWs who tested positive after ‘pa - tient non - AGP’ exposures were not wearing eye pro - tection while interacting with unmasked patients . Five HCWs tested positive after ‘HCW – HCW’ exposures . Four of these cases involved both co - workers being un - masked . In the fifth case , the HCW was masked but the index case was not . Using Fischer’s exact test , we identified that HCWs with community exposures had a significantly higher risk of having a positive SARS - CoV - 2 test in the 14 days fol - lowing their exposure than HCWs with workplace expos - ures ( P < 0 . 001 ) . Discussion This study found a very low frequency of transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 after qualifying workplace exposures . But similar to other studies [ 5 – 8 ] , we found that community exposures , particularly those in the household , resulted in a high frequency of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . Our findings also align with Lentz et al . , who showed that routine contact had a higher risk of nosocomial trans - mission to HCWs than AGPs [ 8 ] . Of the 345 workplace exposures , only 7 resulted in positive SARS - CoV - 2 tests . Five were after exposure to a co - worker and two were after patient exposures . Both of these types of exposures have previously been identi - fied as potential sources of spread in hospitals [ 9 , 10 ] , but these frequencies are still low . The pace of healthcare de - livery may not allow for prolonged co - worker interactions and shorter exposure times could partially account for the lower transmission seen versus community expos - ures . Although total numbers are low , longer duration could explain why exposures from shared offices had a higher frequency of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission than ex - posures from meals and breaks . Our study suggests that even when PPE strategies break down , workplace expos - ures in healthcare are lower risk than anticipated regard - less of whether the index case is a patient or co - worker and the PPE deviations . A limitation of our study was the reliance on HCWs to self - report community exposures . Workplace exposures are typically revealed during contact tracing but are still subject to recall bias . Additionally , our study took place prior to the emergence of new variant strains of SARS - CoV - 2 and prior to vaccination availability . Our analysis showed that exposure in the commu - nity , not the workplace , accounted for the vast majority of positive SARS - CoV - 2 cases after HCW exposures . Workplace exposures were associated with very low SARS - CoV - 2 positivity . Healthcare facilities should con - sider focusing on methods to decrease HCW risk for COVID - 19 and associated exposures outside the work - place , including community education programs and continued programs to reduce vaccine hesitancy .
