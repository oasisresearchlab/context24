In vivo dynamics of RNA polymerase II transcription Xavier Darzacq 1 , 2 , Yaron Shav - Tal 1 , 3 , Valeria de Turris 1 , Yehuda Brody 3 , Shailesh M Shenoy 1 , Robert D Phair 4 & Robert H Singer 1 We imaged transcription in living cells using a locus - speciﬁc reporter system , which allowed precise , single - cell kinetic measurements of promoter binding , initiation and elongation . Photobleaching of ﬂuorescent RNA polymerase II revealed several kinetically distinct populations of the enzyme interacting with a speciﬁc gene . Photobleaching and photoactivation of ﬂuorescent MS2 proteins used to label nascent messenger RNAs provided sensitive elongation measurements . A mechanistic kinetic model that ﬁts our data was validated using speciﬁc inhibitors . Polymerases elongated at 4 . 3 kilobases min – 1 , much faster than previously documented , and entered a paused state for unexpectedly long times . Transcription onset was inefﬁcient , with only 1 % of polymerase - gene interactions leading to completion of an mRNA . Our systems approach , quantifying both polymerase and mRNA kinetics on a deﬁned DNA template in vivo with high temporal resolution , opens new avenues for studying regulation of transcriptional processes in vivo . Transcription by RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) is at the core of gene expression and hence is the basis of all cellular activities . Little information exists about the kinetics of this process in live cells 1 , as understanding of gene expression regulation comes from studies using puriﬁed proteins . For instance , the subunits of the elongating Pol II are well known 2 and the crystal structure of this enzyme explains much of its behavior in vitro 3 , 4 . mRNA transcription can be decon - structed into a succession of steps : promoter assembly , clearance and escape 5 , followed by elongation and termination . The process of transcriptional initiation involves several structural changes in the polymerase as the nascent transcript elongates 6 . Early in initiation , the polymerase can produce abortive transcripts 7 , 8 . These abortive cycles have been observed with a single prokaryote polymerase ( RNAP ) releasing several transcripts without escaping the promoter 9 , 10 . The elongation step can be regulated by pausing for various times , as demonstrated using prokaryotic polymerases in vitro 11 , 12 . For eukaryotic cells , attempts have been made to calculate the endo - genous elongation speed using run - on assays 13 , reverse - transcription ( RT ) - PCR 14 or ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) 15 on speciﬁc mRNAs , and these have yielded apparent elongation estimates ranging from 1 . 1 to 2 . 5 kilobases ( kb ) min – 1 . To date , no assay has been developed to measure the various steps of Pol II transcription in a living cell . For instance , although abortive initiation is widely believed to occur , the dynamics of this event are unknown , including whether initiating polymerases are committed to entering processive elonga - tion or whether they may dissociate from the DNA , and the prob - ability of each event . Furthermore , no assay exists that can measure elongation speed on a chromatin template within a live cell . Accurate measurements of the kinetics of transcription are fundamental to the understanding of transcription assembly , transcriptional regulation and cross - talk with transcription - coupled processes . Here we report accurate in vivo measurements of the mammalian Pol II engaged in each of the steps of active transcription . We previously developed a method for the in vivo labeling of mRNA transcripts containing a series of repeated stem - loops ( from phage MS2 ) , which are speciﬁcally bound by an MS2 coat protein fused to green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) 16 . The assay consists of a human cell line harboring a gene array into which these stem - loops have been integrated 17 . We have now used this system to follow the synthesis of RNA in real time . Our method allows direct measurement of Pol II initiation events as well as elongation in isolation from the other steps of transcription . By using a deterministic computational model constrained by extensive data sets and tested with transcription inhibitors , we were able to extract features of transcription heretofore unexplored and provide a guide for application of the method to other genes . RESULTSKineticsof Pol II transcription We used a cell line with a stable integration of approximately 200 repeats of a gene cassette at a single locus 17 , each containing 256 upstream lacO repeats 18 and a minimal cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) promoter coupled to a tetracycline - operator cassette controlling a gene that encodes a functional mRNA with 24 MS2 repeats in its 3 ¢ untranslated region 16 , 19 ( Fig . 1 ) .

Transcription was acti - vated by the doxycycline - induced binding of a VP16 transactivation domain fused to a modiﬁed tetracycline repressor DNA - binding element . Upon transcriptional activation , we monitored the number of nascent precursor mRNAs ( pre - mRNAs ) at the locus using quanti - tative FISH 20 ( Fig . 1p , t ) , the binding of MS2 - GFP protein to the nascent mRNAs ( Fig . 1o , s ) or the recruitment of RNA polymerase to the site ( Fig . 1c , f , i , l ) . The total number of mRNAs detected at the site ranged from 200 to 400 , with an average of two polymerases per transcription unit . Probes directed to either exon ( Fig . 1w ) or intron sequences ( Fig . 1x ) demonstrated the presence and correct excision of the intron at the transcription site ; exon probes detected the distribution of messenger ribonucleoprotein particles in the nucleoplasm 19 and cytoplasm 21 , whereas intron probes detected only the transcription site 22 , 23 . Phosphorylation of the C - terminal domain ( CTD ) of the Pol II large subunit ( RPB1 ) indicates its activity status 24 . Immunostaining with antibodies to the unphosphorylated CTD ( Fig . 1b – d ) , CTD phosphorylated on Ser5 ( Fig . 1e – g ) or CTD phosphorylated on Ser2 ( Fig . 1h – j ) indicated that all polymerase activity states are present at the transcription site , suggesting that they participate in the three main processes of transcription : promoter binding , promoter clear - ance and elongation ( Fig . 1a ) . A yellow ﬂuorescent protein ( YFP ) fusion of the large subunit of Pol II was recruited and detected at the transcription site , allowing study of the dynamics of these three states ( Fig . 1k – m ) .

By measuring several hundred engaged polymerases , we averaged out the stochastic ‘noise’ of individual gene expression . We selected a stable cell line expressing YFP fused to an a - amanitin – resistant RPB1 mutant ( YFP - RPB1 a Am r ) . Under a - amanitin selection , endogenous RPB1 was degraded 26 and there was no detectable growth phenotype 27 . Doxycycline - induced cells expres - sing YFP - RPB1 a Am r showed an accumulation of the YFP – Pol II signal at the actively transcribing locus ( Fig . 1l ) . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) was measured by bleaching the YFP – Pol II signal enriched at transcription sites ( Fig . 2 ) while the locus was continuously tracked using the RFP - LacI signal ( Fig . 2b ) . A multi - exponential ﬁt of the recovery data revealed that a minimum of three kinetically distinct populations of polymerases were needed to describe the data ( Fig . 2j ) . We postulated that the fraction of the recovery data showing the slowest kinetics represents post - initiation polymerases engaged with the gene and involved in elongation , the fastest fraction represents transient Pol II primary interactions at the promoter site , and the intermediate fraction represents initiation events . We then analyzed ﬂuorescence recovery at the transcription site using mechanistic kinetic models 25 to quantitatively assess our hypothesis . We chose to apply a binding - dominated model , as we were able to verify that nucleoplasmic diffusion of YFP – Pol II did not inﬂuence our results ( see below ) . The model ( Fig . 3a ) simulated the kinetics of Pol II assembly and elongation , and allowed the resolution of time constants for polymerases entering at a single site and the relative molecular ﬂux for each step of the transcription process . A simple , linear sequential model could not ﬁt the data , as this would mean that at steady state almost all the polymerases would accumulate at the slowest ( rate - limiting ) step , so three kinetically distinct popula - tions would not be resolved . Two types of models could ﬁt the data : the ﬁrst would simulate three independent populations of Pol II , each committed to perform - ing only a speciﬁc step of transcription , whereas the second model would involve three interconnected and dependent populations . We considered the ﬁrst solution biologically unrealistic , because then each Pol II subpopulation would have to be recruited independently for promoter binding , initiation and elongation . We therefore pursued the second model and formulated it as a system of ordinary differential equations ( Fig . 3b ) . The model included the sequential steps of polymerase assembly , initiation and elongation as well as exit points for the polymerase from each step , and it therefore was not con - strained to linearity ( see above ) . These exit points represented abortive release from the pre - initiation or initiation complex 28 ( Fig . 3a ) , as suggested by the observation that RNA polymerases have an intrinsic tendency to abort initiation after transcribing a short RNA mole - cule 5 , 29 . Parameter optimization constrained by the experimental data yielded a consistent solution ( Fig . 3c , gray curve ) . In the solution , the mean residence times of the three kinetic fractions for promoter binding , initiation and elongation were 6 , 54 and 517 s , respectively ( Fig . 3c , green , blue and purple curves , respectively ; Table 1 sum - marizes all the measurements ) . These data indicate that , as in many nuclear events , the association of a molecule with its target is based on a series of transient interactions 30 . Pol II commitment to the gene is highly inefﬁcient The best - ﬁt solution of this model predicts that only 13 % of the polymerases interacting with the promoter are delivered to the initiation step and that only 8 . 6 % of these engage in a longer - lasting process consistent with elongation ( Fig . 3c ) . The net result of these sequential processes is that only 1 polymerase in 90 interaction events proceeds to elongation and produces an mRNA molecule . Despite the progressive order - of - magnitude increases in the residence time ( 6 s , 54 s and B 500 s ( 517 ± 103 s ) ) for their respective components , each of the polymerase populations represents about one - third of the steady - state polymerases ( Fig . 3c , green , blue and purple bars ) . This equilibrium is the result of the balanced loss of polymerases during the steps of transcription . In our analysis , we assumed that Pol II diffusion would not affect the measured recovery speed and therefore need not be included in the model ; however , we tested this assumption using established meth - ods 31 , 32 . First , we compared the dynamics of recovery of the gene array to the corresponding recovery of a nucleoplasmic region distant from the array , where it has been shown that the freely diffusing Pol II represents nearly three - fourths of the signal , whereas the engaged polymerases represent one - fourth 33 . This approach compared regions with different numbers of binding sites . The transcription site , contain - ing 200 copies of the gene cassette , ampliﬁed the bound signal , whereas the nucleoplasmic region , expected to contain few active genes , reﬂected the recovery expected from predominately free rather than Gene array Nucleoplasm Free k in k out Promoter Initiating Engaged k ini k escape k abor k term b [ promoter ] = k in [ free ] – k out [ promoter ] – k ini [ promoter ] [ initiating ] = k ini [ promoter ] – k escape [ initiating ] – k abor [ initiating ] [ engaged ] = k escape [ initiating ] – k term [ engaged ] d t d d t d d t d Promoter Initiation Engaged 517 ± 103 s 6 s 54 s 1 . 1 13 c 1 R e l a t i v e i n t e n s i t y 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 0 . 2 0 100 200 300 400 500 Time ( s ) 0 Engaging % Initiating % 30 % 31 % 39 % U nb l eac h e d a Figure 3 Polymerase II mechanistic kinetic model used to simulate the data .

The recovery curve ( Fig . 4a , gray curve ) was ﬁt to a simple differential equation : d i d t ¼ k dif ½ nPolII (cid:1) (cid:2) k dif ½ rPolII (cid:1) where i is the intensity at the site , k dif is the kinetic rate constant of diffusion for this particular setting , [ nPolII ] is the concentration of YFP – Pol II molecules present outside the bleached area and [ rPolII ] is the concentration inside the bleached area . This allowed us to obtain a k dif of 0 . 4 s – 1 , corresponding to a residence time in the bleached region of 2 . 5 s . The three kinetic components extracted from the Pol II simulation were then plotted ( all the diffusion simulations were normalized to range from 0 to 0 . 6 , so that they represent a diffusive range of that magnitude in comparison to the data normalized to range from 0 to 1 ) . The resulting graph demonstrates that even the fastest two components revealed by the model have recovery curves that are distinguishable from diffusion . Diffusion of Pol II represented 60 % of the recovery observed in the nucleoplasm ( Fig . 4a ) , whereas a quickly diffusing component on the gene array remained undetectable over the bound state . This suggests that ( i ) the enrichment provided by the gene array bound by many polymerases rendered the number of molecules diffusing in and out minimal by comparison , and ( ii ) none of the processes observed at the locus occurred at a speed similar to that of diffusion . In addition , we tested whether diffusion limits the binding of polymerases at the transcription site . To address this , we performed FRAP experiments using increasingly large bleach spots , as described 32 . Recovery time was not inﬂuenced by an increase in the diffusional distance in the bleached volume , indicating that the diffusing polymerase molecules are available to the locus within the timescale of our fastest observed component .

( a ) FRAP was measured for YFP – Pol II in the nucleoplasm , where the local concentration of genes is lower than at the gene array . During 40 s of recovery , we observed only the diffusing population of polymerases ( 60 % of the recovery signal ; black dots ) . This component was ﬁt with a kinetic rate constant ( k dif ) to describe the inﬂux and efﬂux of molecules with respect to the nucleoplasmic bleached regions ( gray curve ) . We also plotted the transcription site ( TS ) kinetic components for comparison . The fastest component ( green ) corresponds to a residence time of 6 s . The intermediate component ( blue ) is an order of magnitude slower , and the elongating polymerase ( purple ) is an order of magnitude slower still , as a ﬁxed fraction near 0 was seen on this timescale . Error bars show s . e . m . ; n ¼ 5 . ( b ) FRAP of YFP – Pol II was monitored for 2 . 5 min at the transcription site using four different bleached areas and measuring the recovery of the central transcription site .

Although diffusion does not contribute to the two slower states , the fastest step could reﬂect the binding time plus a small contribution from the diffusion of polymerases entering the system ( Fig . 4a ) . In any case , this interaction time cannot be greater than the residence time of 6 s calculated from the model . Therefore , for the purposes of modeling , we disregarded diffusion . The transcriptional inhibitor DRB affects only elongation We used a transcriptional inhibitor targeting elongation events on the gene array to test and validate the model . We veriﬁed that the slow Pol II recovery component represented elongation by FRAP experiments in the presence of 5 , 6 - dichloro - 1 - b - D - ribofuranosylbenzimidazole ( DRB ) 35 , an elongation inhibitor that acts on the positive transcription elongation factor P - TEFb 36 ( Fig . 5a ) . Under these conditions , the slow recovery phase was undetectable , with a residence time longer than our detection limit , validating this phase as the elongation step . In contrast , the two fastest components were unaffected , irrespective of the acquisition source . This demonstrates that the Pol II slow component depends on elongating polymerases . We checked our model by drawing curves based on residence times that varied by 20 % ( Fig . 5b , gray ) or 40 % ( red ) from the elongation time calculated from the best - ﬁt curve ( blue ) . The data fall within the 20 % error curves . Hence , we set the elongation time at 517 ± 103 s . Direct measurements of elongation kinetics The average polymerase velocity over this time ( 517 s ) for the 3 . 3 - kb gene would be approximately 378 bases min – 1 , much slower than has been reported 37 . This suggests that an additional process may be taking place within the elongating population . To investigate the elongation kinetics at a temporal resolution capable of distinguishing subpopulations and independent of the preceding initiation events , we directly imaged transcription of the MS2 - labeled RNA on the last 2 . 3 kb of the gene ( Fig . 1a ) . We measured the recovery kinetics of ﬂuorescent MS2 fusion protein bound to the MS2 stem - loops in the mRNA after photobleaching the transcription site ( Fig . 6a – i ) , provid - ing readouts that correlate with the rate of transcription on the gene . Notably , the FRAP curve best ﬁt a sum of two exponential functions , one fast and one much slower ( Fig . 6j ) . Because the recovery was dominated by the faster component , the second exponential could not be resolved with conﬁdence . Consequently , to delineate the kinetics of the slower fraction , we used a photoactivatable GFP ( paGFP ) fusion of the MS2 protein 19 ( Fig . 6k – s ) . In contrast to the photobleaching experiment , previously transcribed MS2 - tagged mRNA was ﬂuores - cently activated and monitored until its release from the transcription machinery . This allowed resolution of the slower fraction with higher conﬁdence , as it quickly became the sole contributor to the measured ﬂuorescence after the fast component had disappeared ( Fig . 6t ) . The photoactivation experiment thus conﬁrmed the hypothesis that elongation consists of two kinetically resolved components , one fast and one much slower . Both photobleaching recovery and photoactivation data were ﬁt to a single kinetic model ( as they measured the same events ) , in which their initial step ( entry point ) was elongation , the process responsible for synthesizing new MS2 - binding sites , and the end step ( exit point ) was mRNA release into the nucleoplasm 19 . The slow component of the FRAP and photoactivation curves must correspond to a transcriptional process , because adding DRB resulted in the disappearance of the signal at the transcription site ( data not DIC 6 . 6 206 52 . 1 15 3 . 2 546 a e d c b f g h i MS2 - GFP RFP - LacI Pre j R e l a t i v e i n t en s i t y 1 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 0 . 2 – 0 . 1 – 0 . 1 – 0 . 2 0 R e l a t i v e i n t en s i t y 1 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 0 . 2 0 6 . 6 206 52 . 1 15 3 . 2 546 Pre k o n m l p q r s MS2 - paGFP RFP - LacI DIC 0 100 200 300 400 500 Time ( s ) 0 0 t 0 100 200 300 400 500 Time ( s ) f ( t ) = 1 + A 1 e – a 1 t + A 2 e – a 2 t f ( t ) = 1 + A 1 e – a 1 t + A 2 e – a 2 t A 1 A 2 a 1 a 2 – 0 . 672 0 . 079 0 . 014 – 0 . 192 – 0 . 846 - - - - - - 0 . 02 AIC BIC – 2 . 99 – 2 . 04 – 2 . 89 – 1 . 99 A 1 A 2 a 1 a 2 – 0 . 412 0 . 03 0 . 004 – 0 . 603 1 - - - 0 . 02 - - - AIC BIC – 2 . 10 – 0 . 85 – 2 . 02 – 0 . 82 Figure 6 Quantifying mRNA synthesis in vivo .

It is therefore likely that this slow component corresponds to the data above for DRB - sensitive polymerase activity . Therefore , in the model proposed above , we considered the slow polymerase process highlighted by the MS2 experiments to be a component of elongation , thereby incorporating both sets of kinetics . As polymerase pausing during elongation has been observed for both prokaryotic 38 and eukaryotic transcriptional machinery 39 , we also added the possibility of pausing to the model . The two polymerase states were modeled as elongation with a stochastic transition to pausing ( Fig . 7a ) . Optimization of the differential equations from this model ( Fig . 7b ) , constrained by ﬁtting of both the photobleaching recovery and photoactivation data simultaneously , yielded an elongation speed of 4 . 3 kb min – 1 with a stochastic transition to a slower synthesis rate ( pausing for a cumulative time of 4 min ) . Modeling showed that this transition from elongation to pausing affected only 4 . 2 % of the polymerases that enter elongation . However , because they stay on the gene longer , they represent 26 % of the polymerases seen at the locus ( Fig . 7c summarizes these parameters for the ﬁts in Fig . 7d , e ; also see Discussion ) . As with the curves ﬁt to the polymerase kinetics data , we tested the signiﬁcance of the best ﬁts ( Fig . 7f , g , blue ) for photobleaching recovery and photoactivation by varying the para - meters by 20 % ( gray ) and 40 % ( red ) . We tested the ﬁt of each of the components of the model , elongation and pausing . For elongation , we varied the calculated polymerase velocity to ﬁnd how well this velocity ﬁt ( Fig . 8a , b ) . We did the same for pausing , testing various pause efﬁciencies and times ( Fig . 8c , d ; see Discussion ) . In addition , we eliminated alternative models using criteria described in the Discus - sion , because they did not accommodate the experimental results . These FRAP and photoactivation data resolved Pol II elongation into two processes , rapid elongation and probabilistic pausing . Transcriptional inhibitors reduce elongation kinetics To validate the elongation component further , we performed GFP - MS2 FRAP experiments after treatment with drugs that inhibited transcription . Actinomycin D intercalates into DNA and stalls the polymerase 34 , generating a predominantly static fraction in the recovery curve ( Fig . 9a ) . The remaining recovering fraction could be ﬁt ( albeit with low conﬁdence ) to our model using the same para - meters as for the data from untreated cells , opening the possibility that our short actinomycin D treatment did not completely abolish transcription . This is in agreement with the hypothesis that actinomycin D acts on transcription by stalling polymerases . A polymerase could therefore be either stalled by the drug or fully active between intercalation sites . Upon treatment with actinomycin D for longer times , the transcription sites could not be detected owing to the release or degradation of the nascent RNAs . Camptothecin 40 targets topoisomerase I 41 , 42 , which is necessary to relax DNA super - coiling during transcription . Treatment with this drug yielded a slower transcriptional rate of 1 kb min – 1 ( Fig . 9b ) , consistent with the expected effect of slower DNA unwinding . This quantiﬁes topoisome - rase I’s contribution to elongation speed . The effects of these drugs were in accordance with their known modes of action . In addition , kinetic modeling provided a quantitative insight into the mechanism of action for each of the drugs . For instance , the increased torsion of the DNA in the presence of the topoisomerase inhibitor reduced the velocity of the polymerase to about one - fourth of its normal speed , a measure of the contribution of unwinding to transcription . As mentioned above , we also treated cells with DRB before FRAP analysis of MS2 - GFP – labeled sites , but the MS2 - GFP signal decreased faster than with actinomycin D and did not permit us to perform FRAP measurements even soon after treatment . Therefore , the experi - ments described above were done at after short DRB treatments on transcription sites where the drug’s effect is probably not complete . DISCUSSION We have analyzed the transcriptional process in vivo on a speciﬁc gene array in the mammalian nucleus .

The results of our analysis and modeling suggest the following conclusions . 1 . A small fraction of polymerases at any moment are paused during elongation for cumulatively long periods . At steady state , they account for about one - fourth of all polymerase signals , because polymerases that do not pause contribute their ﬂuorescent signals for much shorter times . We cannot distinguish whether the pausing of a single polymerase consists of many short pauses or one long pause . If a larger number of polymerases were paused , the genes would ﬁll up with paused polymerases . In our analysis , a model in which more polymerases are paused at any time ( for example , 10 % ) is inconsistent with the data ( Fig . 8c ) . Notably , the pausing described here is different from the promoter - proximal pausing observed using chromatin immunoprecipitation of Pol II subunits 5 , 43 – 46 , as the pausing we detected occurred 1 kb downstream from the promoter . Stochastic pausing can be detected only by time - resolved live - cell measurements , and not by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay , which cannot differentiate paused polymerases that are distributed randomly along each gene and are present in only a small subpopulation of the genes . 2 . Elongation in the absence of pausing proceeded much faster than published estimates of overall mRNA synthesis rates ( about 70 bases s – 1 , compared with about 30 bases s – 1 ) . This is because we measured only the maximum polymerase velocity . Previous studies measured the total time required to produce mRNAs , from transcriptional induction to accumulation of mature mRNAs 13 , 14 , 34 . Those analyses therefore provide an averaged polymerase velocity slower than what we observed . As the slowest population comprises elongating polymerases , we can estimate the time necessary for transcription starting at the promoter . The mean interaction time of 517 ± 103 s corresponds to an elongation speed of 0 . 4 ± 0 . 08 kb min – 1 . This result is in accordance with a previous report 34 that RNA polymerase’s average residence time in random positions of the nucleus is about 20 min , corresponding to an elongation speed of 0 . 7 kb min – 1 for an average transcription - unit size of 14 kilobases . We consider these values to be lower estimates , as the measurements reﬂect all the events from commitment to elongation to release from the gene . For instance , it is known that polymerases do not elongate at constant rates : site - speciﬁc pauses have been described at splicing and polyadenylation sites , and during early elongation 47 . Additionally , polymerases are known to transcribe further downstream past the cleavage and polyadenylation site 48 . Finally , nothing is known about the time necessary for subsequent release of the RNA . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 1 2 3 4 5 Time ( s ) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 Time ( s ) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 Time ( s ) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 Time ( s ) R e l a t i v e i n t en s i t y 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 R e l a t i v e i n t en s i t y 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 R e l a t i v e i n t en s i t y 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 R e l a t i v e i n t en s i t y Elongation speeds ( kb min – 1 ) Elongation speeds ( kb min – 1 ) 1 2 3 4 5 MS2 - GFP FRAP elongation speed MS2 - paGFP elongation speed 60 120 180 240 300 360 420 480 MS2 - paGFP pausing time Pausingtimes ( s ) a b d MS2 - paGFP pausing efficiency 90 % 0 % 5 % 10 % 15 % 20 % 30 % 40 % 50 % 80 % 70 % 60 % S l o w p r o c e ss en t r y e ff i c i en cy c Figure 8 Simulations of RNA synthesis curve ﬁtting to test the effects of different pausing percentages and residence times on our model . ( a , b ) Different elongation speeds ranging from 1 to 5 kb min – 1 were simulated to illustrate that slower elongation speeds are inconsistent with our FRAP and photoactivation data . Data in a , b ( black dots ) are the same as in Figure 6j , t , respectively . ( c ) Best - ﬁt solution predicts that a small fraction of polymerases ( 4 . 2 % in our solution ) enter long pauses ; here we explored situations where different amounts of polymerases are forced to pause , ranging from 0 % ( dark blue ) to 90 % ( green ) . A nonpausing system is simulated by a single - exponential fast decay , and increasing percentages of pausing allow the slow decay to dominate the simulation , gradually becoming the predominant population at the locus . This demonstrates that our model depends on only a small fraction of the polymerases pausing . Data ( black dots ) are the same as in Figure 6t . ( d ) Curves based on different pausing times illustrate that although our data ( black dots ; same as in Fig . 6t ) cannot distinguish small differences in pausing time , larger variations are inconsistent with the data . A R T I C L E S 802 VOLUME 14 NUMBER 9 SEPTEMBER 2007 NATURE STRUCTURAL & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY © 2007 N a t u r e P ub li s h i ng G r oup h tt p : / / www . n a t u r e . c o m / n s m b High rates of elongation ( 5 . 6 kb min – 1 ) have been reported previously for RNA polymerase I transcription in the nucleolus 49 . This value was determined by measuring recovery after photobleach - ing of the polymerase , but it is similar to our measurement of Pol II elongation speed using the MS2 sites . This suggests that pausing is a Pol II – speciﬁc behavior . In the case of Pol I , the high efﬁciency of promoter escape led to 70 - base distances between polymerases , as observed in Miller spreads 50 , implying that pausing within these transcription units would lead to catastrophic stalling . In contrast , polymerases observed on nonribosomal DNA spreads are spaced more than 4 kb apart 51 , consistent with our observations of an average of two polymerases per gene ( Table 1 ) . Taking into account these considerations , transcription by RNA polymerases I and II can be seen as two evolutionarily selected modes of regulation of the same enzymatic process , a view strengthened by their common subunits and conserved structural features . 3 . Transcription can be inefﬁcient . According to the above calcula - tion , only 1 in 90 polymerases proceeds to elongation . The observed lack of processivity through the initial step of transcription—promoter escape , or clearance—makes a recycling model unlikely ; otherwise , the transcription sites would not have completely recovered from photo - bleaching . Moreover , it suggests that the low efﬁciency with which the polymerase binds and engages at the promoter may be biologically useful . For instance , it may reduce the background of transcriptional noise , ensuring efﬁcient transcription from a promoter only when many polymerases persistently interact 52 . Notably , this result contrasts with recent ﬁndings on insect systems , which have suggested a recycling mechanism for Pol II molecules sequestered at induced heat - shock loci on polytene chromosomes 53 . A recycling mechanism for Pol II is not supported by the conditions of our model , where the number of free polymerases is large compared to the number of promoters , but these conditions may not hold for the polytene heat - shock locus . 4 . At the single - gene level , the production of mRNA may not be a continuous process . The model predicts that a single gene in the array produces an RNA about once or twice per minute ( Table 1 ) . As one - fourth of elongating polymerases are paused , at least one - fourth of genes would have a paused polymerase at any given time . A nonpausing polymerase could transcribe the entire 3 . 3 - kb gene in 46 s ( at 4 . 3 kb min – 1 ) . If transcription were initiated by a lead polymerase that paused for a total of 4 min , other polymerases might ‘pile up’ behind it ( as though it were a Sunday driver on a narrow road ) . This would result in discontinuous production of RNA . If the gene were highly expressed ( that is , if its transcription were initiated frequently ) this could result in ‘pulsing’ of transcription 54 , where the polymerases pile up and then the obstructed transcripts ‘burst’ when the pausing of the downstream polymerase is relieved , possibly by rephosphorylation of the CTD or ‘bumping’ by an upstream polymerase 38 . Previous work has clearly shown that poly - merases can pause for some time before resuming transcription , for instance in response to heat shock or other factors 5 , 46 . 5 . The ampliﬁed gene array provides an ensemble measurement . It allows clear visualization of the transcriptional process owing to the high signal - to - noise ratio of the measured ﬂuorescence . Although transcription has been shown to take place in assemblies of genes and polymerases termed ‘transcription factories’ , one should be cautious when extrapolating from the present array system to single genes or single factories . The results obtained from the array were interpreted under the assumption that all genes were equally active . However , the yield per gene would be different if a smaller number of different genes were transcribed . Still , the number of genes could not be small ( for example , 20 ) , as the polymerases would become too closely packed to allow the low percentage of pausing we modeled . It is probably also possible that other genes are transcribed more efﬁciently that the construct described here . For instance , recent unpublished results using similar approaches ( E . Bertrand , Institut Ge´ne´tique Mole´culaire de Montpellier , personal communication ) suggest that transcription of viral genes may be much more efﬁcient . Thus , varieties of gene expression may be revealed and described more completely and mechanistically using similar quantitative approaches . A systems - modeling approach combined with a quantitative assess - ment of the various kinetic parameters of transcription has allowed a more complete understanding of the components of gene expression .

These data are consistent with the drug causing inhibition of topoisomerase I , so that polymerases can not proceed at full speed owing to torsional stress imposed by the supercoiling of the DNA 41 .

As the initiation frequency increases , pausing becomes more of a limiting factor ; hence , regulation of the pause time is essential to allow high levels of gene expression over short periods of time . Recently , elegant work on the assembly of transcription factors on the heat - shock locus in living Drosophila cells 53 has demonstrated that new developments in microscopy will allow testing of kinetic hypotheses using endogenous genes to determine the time dependence of splicing or termination . We therefore expect that future results with endogenous genes , as more sensitive microscopy methods are introduced , will reveal the myriad of controls by which genes are expressed 55 . METHODS Cell line . A genomic locus into which a gene was integrated served as an inducible transcription site for a 3 . 4 - kb pre - mRNA 17 ( Fig . 1a ) . Preceding the transgene were 256 lacO repeats , which could be detected with a LacI repressor protein fused to a ﬂuorescent tag ( CFP or RFP , depending on the color combination needed for the experiment ) to identify the chromosomal site of integration in living cells 18 . The promoter consists of a minimal CMV promoter preceded by 96 Tet operator repeats , which bind a chimeric transcriptional activator composed of the reverse tetracycline repressor ( rTetR ) doxycycline - dependent DNA - binding domain and the VP16 transactivation domain . The mRNA contained a 5 ¢ sequence encoding CFP bearing a tripeptide peroxisome - targeting sequence , allowing us to monitor the translation of the mRNA via accumulation of the CFP signal in cytoplasmic peroxisomes . For real - time detection of the RNA , we inserted 24 MS2 - binding sites downstream of the open reading frame . These sequences are bound efﬁciently and speciﬁcally by a ﬂuorescently tagged MS2 bacteriophage coat protein . The 3 ¢ end of the transcript consisted of the last intron - exon module of the mRNA encoding human b - globin , followed by its terminator . Approximately 200 copies of this gene were stably integrated into a euchromatic site in a human osteosarcoma cell line ( U2OS ) 17 . Cell culture and transfection . Human U2OS osteosarcoma cells containing the integrated gene ( clone 2 - 3 - 6 ) were cultured , transfected and transcriptionally activated as described 17 . Brieﬂy , cells were cultured in low - glucose DMEM ( Invitrogen ) with 10 % ( v / v ) FBS and , for live - cell experiments , were main - tained in phenol red – free Leibovitz’s L15 medium . Cells were transfected by electroporation ( using a Bio - Rad Gene Pulser Xcell ) with 2 m g of pTet - On , 2 m g of pSV2 - XFP - Lac repressor and 40 m g of sheared salmon sperm DNA ( Amresco ) . Plasmids encoding GFP - MS2 with a nuclear localization signal ( GFP - MS2 - NLS ) and a similar construct with photoactivatable GFP ( paGFP - MS2 - NLS ) were cotransfected in some experiments . Cells were plated on coverslips or dishes coated with Cell - Tak ( BD Biosciences ) . Transcription was induced by the addition of doxycycline ( 1 m g ml – 1 ) to the medium for 30 min . A stable cell line expressing a YFP - fused , a - amanitin – resistant RPB1 mutant ( YFP - RPB1 a Am r ) was established using a - amanitin as a selection marker . Under a - amanitin selection , endogenous RPB1 is degraded 26 ; selected cells were viable for over 1 month with no detectable growth phenotype , demon - strating the full functionality of YFP - RPB1 a Am r ( ref . 27 ) .

Because we experimentally determined the number of nascent mRNAs present at the transcription site , we assumed that polymerases were evenly distributed on the gene to estimate the number of polymerases loaded on the transcription unit upstream of the MS2 - binding repeats ( using the ratio 2 . 3 kb / 3 . 3 kb ) .

Photoactivation and ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching . Transfected cells were plated on 0 . 17 - mm Delta T dishes ( Bioptechs ) , and transcription was induced by doxycycline 30 min before live - cell imaging . Experiments were performed at 37 1 C using a temperature - controlled Delta T4 culture dish system with a heated lid and an objective heater ( Bioptechs ) . Images were collected using independent imaging platforms , three confocal systems and a wide - ﬁeld microscope for live - cell imaging , described below . On the Leica confocal microscope , cells were scanned using a 488 - nm laser for detection of GFP - MS2 , paGFP - MS2 or YFP – Pol II at the locus , and with a 543 - nm laser for detection of RFP - LacI . GFP ﬂuorescence was activated at the transcription site using one full - power pulse of a 405 - nm laser for 1 . 635 s . Time - lapse imaging was done after bleaching , in two phases : a fast acquisition ( 593 Hz for FRAP and 612 Hz for photoactivation ) for 30 frames followed by a second acquisition at 100 Hz for 50 frames . We tested constant imaging frequencies of 500 , 200 and 100 Hz for 80 frames to check that the frequency change did not inﬂuence the recovery , verifying that data from the constant - frequency protocol were consistent with those from our dual - frequency protocol ( data not shown ) . With the wide - ﬁeld microscope used for live - cell imaging , the cells were photoactivated or bleached using a Mosaic Digital Diaphragm System ( Photo - nic Instruments ) and imaged in three dimensions over time using a 200 - nm z - axis step size over a range of 2 . 2 m m to capture the transcription site , which moves in three dimensions . Three three - dimensional stacks were acquired before bleaching . The recovery was imaged in two phases . Milliseconds after bleaching , three - dimensional stacks were acquired every 3 s for 120 s . Then the stacks were acquired every 10 s for 500 s . Each stack was composed of 11 frames . The three - dimensional data were transformed into two - dimensional movies using a maximum projection , and the data were analyzed using the same protocol as for analysis of the confocal data , described below . Pol II diffusion was imaged in two dimensions , one image every 0 . 5 s for the ﬁrst 25 s and then one every 0 . 6 s for 60 s . The spot - size experiments were done with a Zeiss LSM 5 Live DuoScan microscope and images were acquired in two dimensions every 0 . 5 s for 10 s , then every 3 s for 90 s and ﬁnally every 5 s for 50 s . Drug treatments . For DRB treatment , stable cells expressing YFP – Pol II and growing regularly in a - amanitin ( 25 m g ml – 1 ) , were transfected , plated and induced with doxycycline . After 30 min of induction , DRB ( Sigma ) was add to the medium at 37 – 50 m g ml – 1 . FRAP experiments were done 10 – 60 min after drug treatment . For actinomycin D treatment , doxycycline - induced cells transfected with GFP - MS2 were incubated with 5 m g ml – 1 actinomycin D ( Sigma ) for 20 min and transcription sites were photobleached thereafter . For camptothecin treatment , doxycycline - induced cells transfected with GFP - MS2 were incubated with 14 m M of ( S ) - ( + ) - camptothecin ( Sigma ) for 15 – 45 min as described 42 . The experiments were done on a Zeiss confocal microscope at 37 1 C using the FCS2 live - cell chamber system ( Bioptechs ) and an objective heater ( Bioptechs ) . Cells were scanned using a 488 - nm laser for detection of GFP - MS2 and a 543 - nm laser for detection of RFP - LacI repressor protein at the locus . To compare the microscope systems , we also photobleached doxycycline - induced cells without drug treatment , and the recovery curve was identical to the one collected on the Leica confocal system ( Fig . 9b ) . Mechanistic kinetic modeling . FRAP and photoactivation experiments were modeled using ProcessDB ( Integrative Bioinformatics ; http : / / www . integrative bioinformatics . com ) to generate the systems of differential equations , and Berkeley Madonna ( http : / / www . berkeleymadonna . com ) was used to solve and ﬁt the models . Table 1 summarizes all the kinetic parameters obtained in this paper and explains how they were calculated . Additional methods .
