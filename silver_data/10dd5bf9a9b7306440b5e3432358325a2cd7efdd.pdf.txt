A key inducer of this transition is the transcription factor Snail , which represses E - cadherin . We report that conditional expression of the human transcriptional repressor Snail in colorectal cancer cells induces an epithelial dedifferentiation program that coincides with a drastic change in cell morphology . Snail target genes control the establishment of several junctional complexes , intermediate filament networks , and the actin cytoskeleton . Modulation of the expression of these genes is associated with loss of cell aggregation and induction of invasion . Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments showed that repression of selected target genes is associated with increased binding of Snail to their promoters , which contain consensus Snail - binding sites . Thus , Snail constitutes a master switch that directly represses the epithelial phenotype , resulting in malignant carcinoma cells . ( Cancer Res 2005 ; 65 ( 14 ) : 6237 - 44 ) Introduction Snail is a transcriptional repressor that plays a central role in epithelial - mesenchymal transition , a process by which epithelial cells lose their polarity and are converted to a mesenchymal phenotype ( 1 ) . Epithelial - mesenchymal transition is important in many developmental processes , such as gastrulation and neural crest migration , but its deregulation in cancer cells can lead to tumor progression . Multiple signaling pathways seem to converge to Snail expression during different normal developmental steps but also during tumor progression . Besides their involvement in epithelial - mesenchymal transition , Snail family members have been implicated in a variety of other processes , such as apoptosis and left - right asymmetry ( 2 , 3 ) . Up to now , the mechanism by which Snail influences these different cellular processes remains largely unresolved . Snail can repress E - cadherin through binding to E - boxes in the E - cadherin promoter ( 4 , 5 ) . Other candidate repressors for E - cadherin are Slug , E12 / E47 , y - EF1 ( ZEB1 ) , and SIP1 ( ZEB2 ; reviewed in ref . 6 ) . Furthermore , Snail suppresses the expression of claudins and occludins ( 7 ) , and other epithelial genes such as MUC1 and cytokeratin 18 ( 8 ) . However , until now , few studies have focused on the global effects of Snail transcriptional activity , and information on the early response genes in cells expressing Snail is limited . Here , we show that conditional expression of human Snail ( hSnail ) in human colon cancer cells promotes an epithelial - mesenchymal transition – like process in which loss of intercellular adhesion coincides with induction of invasiveness . To identify transcriptional changes that are specific responses toward hSnail expression , a comparative differential gene expression analysis using cDNA microarrays was done . This molecular functional analysis revealed that Snail induction leads to a general ( de ) regulation of epithelial differentiation , metabolism , and signal transduction . Using chromatin immunoprecipitation , we identified several new direct cellular targets of Snail . These molecular data provide a better understanding of the functional consequences of Snail expression during tumor progression . Materials and Methods Cell culture and generation of stable cell lines . DLD - 1TR21 cells were cultured in RPMI with 10 % FCS , 100 units / mL penicillin , and 100 A g / mL streptomycin . Linearized pcDNA4 / TO - hSnailMyc / His plasmid was stably transfected by electroporation . Clones were isolated after 2 weeks of selection on 500 A g / mL zeocin and 10 A g / mL blasticidin ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) . Expression was induced using doxycycline ( 1 A g / mL , Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) . DLD - 1TR21 - hSnailMyc / His cells were retrovirally transduced with pFB - Neo - hEcad . Cells were selected on 300 A g / mL neomycin for 2 weeks . DLD - 1TR21 cells were retrovirally transduced with either the pFB - Neo - enhanced green fluorescent protein ( EGFP ) or the pFB - Neo - EGFP - hSnail vector . After selection for 2 weeks , cells underwent two cycles of sorting using the FACSVantage ( Becton Dickinson , San Jose , CA ) . All constructs used were obtained with standard cloning techniques . Sequence verification was carried out with sequence - specific primers . Quantitative real - time PCR . Design of primers and probes , cDNA synthesis , and PCR amplification were described previously ( 9 ) . In addition , we used TaqMan Gene Expression Assays ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) . Sequences of primers and probes are listed in Supplementary Table S1 . The average threshold cycle of triplicate reactions was used for all subsequent calculations using the D C t method . Immunocytochemistry . Immunocytochemistry was done using stan - dard procedures ( 9 ) . In addition , mouse monoclonal antibodies recognizing E - cadherin ( HECD - 1 , Takara , Kyoto , Japan ) , p120ctn ( Transduction , San Jose , CA ) , plakophilin - 2 ( Progen , Heidelberg , Germany ) , and claudin - 4 ( Zymed , San Francisco , CA ) were used . Collagen invasion and fast aggregation assay . The assays were done as described ( 9 ) . RNA preparation . Cells were grown to subconfluency , trypsinized , washed , and resuspended in 4 mol / L guanidine thiocyanate buffer . Lysates were homogenized on ice with a syringe and needle . RNA was pelleted by ultracentrifugation through CsCl buffer at 32 , 000 rpm . The pellet was resuspended in 0 . 3 mol / L sodium acetate ( pH 6 . 0 ) and precipitated with 100 % ethanol . RNA was further purified by phenol / chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation before removal of genomic DNA by DNase Note : Supplementary data for this article are available at Cancer Research Online ( http : / / cancerres . aacrjournals . org / ) .

Treated samples were then purified again in the same way . cDNA microarray analysis . Construction of the four human 5K microarrays , probe labeling , hybridization , washing , and scanning were carried out at the MicroArray Facility of the Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology ( details in ref . 10 ) . A gene was scored as down - regulated if the [ normratio 3 ] Av + 2 . 33 r [ normratio 3 ] Av < 0 . 75 and the [ normratio 2 ] Av < 0 . 57 ; a gene was scored as up - regulated if the [ normratio 3 ] Av (cid:1) 2 . 33 r [ normratio 3 ] Av > 1 . 25 and the [ normratio 2 ] Av > 1 . 75 . Genes were selected only if they complied with these selection criteria in the three hybridization experiments representing RNA samples harvested at three time points after Snail induction . Northern blot analysis . Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) . Hybridizations were done as described before ( 9 ) . Specific sequences were amplified from MicroArray Facility clones that had been sequenced with universal M13 forward and reverse primers . Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis . Chromatin immunopre - cipitation analysis was done as previously described ( 11 ) . The Snail antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology ( Santa Cruz , CA ) . For EGFP , we used living colors peptide antibody ( Clontech , Mountain View , CA ) . Fragments were analyzed by quantitative real - time PCR . Results and Discussion Human Snail induction in colorectal cancer cells leads to morphologic changes that coincide with loss of aggregation and induction of invasion . To elucidate the functional consequences of Snail expression on epithelial differentiation , we made use of an inducible cell system , the epithelial DLD - 1TR21 cell line , which expresses high levels of the tetracycline activator ( 12 ) . These cells were stably transfected with an expression vector harboring a Myc - tagged full - length human Snail under control of a responsive tetracycline operator element . hSnail expression was induced by adding doxycyclin to the medium , and mRNA could readily be observed 12 hours after induction , as shown by real - time quantitative PCR ( Fig . 1 A ) . This was confirmed by immunofluorescent analysis , which clearly showed nuclear localization of induced hSnail ( Fig . 1 B ) . Changes in morphology from an epithelioid morphotype to a fibroblast - like type could be seen 48 hours after hSnail induction , and became more pronounced after long - term doxycyclin adminis - tration ( Fig . 1 C ) . This transition is in agreement with previous reports of mouse Snail expression in the dog Madin - Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cell line ( 4 , 5 ) . To our knowledge , an inducible cell line for hSnail has not been reported thus far . Expression of hSnail altered the aggregation behavior of the cells . Whereas noninduced cells showed significant aggregation after 30 minutes , hSnail induction abrogated this normal cell - to - cell aggregation to an extent similar to that caused by an E - cadherin blocking antibody , DECMA - 1 ( Fig . 1 E ) . In addition , invasion into collagen type I gels was efficiently induced by hSnail ( Fig . 1 D ) . Altogether , this colon cancer cell system for conditional hSnail expression enables the study of the very early molecular mechanisms by which hSnail executes its function as promoter of cancer invasion . Functional analysis of induced Snail expression using gene expression profiling . To understand the molecular mechanism by which hSnail expression induces loss of epithelial differentiation , we analyzed differential gene expression upon hSnail induction . To search in the population of differentially expressed genes for those directly under the control of hSnail , microarrays were used to monitor expression profiles 12 , 24 , and 48 hours after hSnail induction . Of the 17 , 268 cDNAs examined , hSnail consistently Table 1 .

These data indicate that hSnail acts mainly as a transcriptional repressor . It may be surprising that a set of genes is up - regulated by a transcriptional repressor , but it had already been shown that Snail induces the promoter activity of ZEB1 ( 8 ) . Our data mining comprised the annotation of the most characteristic gene ontology term to a cluster of genes . The analysis was done with the Web - based gene ontology tools FatiGO ( http : / / fatigo . bioinfo . cnio . es / ) and AmiGO ( http : / / www . godatabase . org ) . Gene ontology analysis revealed that Snail has a strong impact on genes involved in epithelial differentiation , metabolism , and signal transduction ( Table 1 ) . Snail acts on different epithelial adhesion junctions . The first cluster of down - regulated genes concerns epithelial differentiation , suggesting a profound effect on cytoskeletal orga - nization and different intercellular junctional and adhesive complexes ( Table 1 ) . This cluster was studied in more detail . Surprisingly , E - cadherin was not detected in the microarray analysis as a gene repressed by hSnail . E - cadherin had been described as a major target gene for mSnail ( 4 , 5 ) . However , we found only a moderate repression of E - cadherin mRNA levels upon hSnail expression in the DLD - 1TR21 system ( Fig . 2 A ) .

Furthermore , a drop in E - cadherin protein expression is detectable only after 4 days of hSnail induction ( Fig . 2 B ) . Additional retroviral transduction of E - cadherin in the inducible cell line DLD - 1TR21 - hSnail generated high E - cadherin expression levels inde - pendently of hSnail repression , but was unable to restore the loss of aggregation or prevent induction of invasion ( Fig . 1 D and data not shown ) . Seemingly , high E - cadherin expression by itself is unable to counteract the epithelial dedifferentiation induced by Snail . This is in agreement with the observation that reintro - duction of E - cadherin in MDCK - Snail cells does not alter the fibroblastic morphology of the cells ( 13 ) . Claudin - 4 , an important component of the tight junctions , was dramatically repressed on both the mRNA and protein levels ( Fig . 2 A - C ) . There exists in vitro and in vivo evidence that this protein acts as a tumor suppressor ( 14 ) . Moreover , transforming growth factor - h ( TGF - h ) , a known inducer of members of the Snail family , is able to repress claudin - 4 . Interestingly , it has been reported that members of the TGF - h family induce Snail family members in several different systems ( 15 , 16 ) . It was previously shown that mSnail can repress the promoter activities of the mouse claudin - 3 , claudin - 4 , and claudin - 7 genes ( 7 ) . Also , plakophilin - 2 is repressed after hSnail induction ( Fig . 2 C ) . Plakophilin - 2 is a desmosomal component that can directly interact with desmo - plakin , plakoglobin , desmoglein - 1 and desmoglein - 2 , and desmo - collin - 1a and desmocollin - 2a ( 17 ) . Eliminating plakophilin - 2 by hSnail would then likely lead to a significant perturbation of the desmosomal assembly . Human Snail regulates genes involved in a program that remodels the cytoskeleton . A remarkably high number of genes down - regulated by hSnail belong to the cytoskeleton group ( Table 1 ) . This group embraces microfilaments , interme - diate filaments , and microtubules . The various elements of the cytoskeleton not only serve the maintenance of cell shape but also have roles in other cellular functions , including cell movement , cell division , endocytosis , and movement of organelles .

July 15 , 2005 Research . on May 1 , 2017 . © 2005 American Association for Cancer cancerres . aacrjournals . org Downloaded from hSnail modulates a large subset of seven different epithelial - specific cytokeratins whose transcriptional repression was confirmed by Northern blot analysis for four cytokeratins ( Fig . 3 A ) . The primary function of these proteins is to impart resistance to mechanical stress to cells , as cytokeratins are the major structural proteins in epithelial cells , forming a cytoplasmic network of intermediate filaments . Studies in knockout mice showed functional redundancy between keratins . However , in double - knockout mice , a failure of the compensation mechanism can lead to fragility of the cell ( 18 ) . In this respect , the modulation of a whole set of keratins seems to be an excellent strategy for breaking the topological organization of the cell . Intriguingly , a cluster of cytokeratin genes was previously found to be up - regulated after expression of KLF - 4 , an epithelial enriched , zinc finger – containing transcription factor ( 19 ) . We showed that KLF - 4 is down - regulated after hSnail expression ( Fig . 4 A ) . KLF - 4 controls in vivo differentiation of specific epithelial functions , as was shown by knockout studies ( 20 ) . It is likely that some key factors , such as KLF4 , are involved in the coordinated up - regulation of a cluster of cytokeratin genes , conferring epithelial characteristics to the cell , whereas other factors , such as Snail , have the opposite effect . Actin filaments represent another important part of the cytoskeletal framework . They are linked to the plasma membrane through various linker proteins and are associated with many actin - modulating proteins . Induction of hSnail leads to a dramatic change in actin cytoskeleton organization , as was shown by staining with phalloidin - FITC ( Fig . 3 C ) . Noninduced cells show a cortical localization of actin , whereas hSnail induction leads to the organization of actin in stress fibers . Gelsolin and its homologue CAPG are capping proteins that are strongly down - regulated upon hSnail induction ( Fig . 3 B ) . Our microarray analysis revealed down - regulation of other actin - modulating genes as well . SLC9A3R1 , better known as NHE - RF , is highly expressed in the epithelia of many tissues , particularly in cells with numerous microvilli , and is often concentrated at the luminal membrane . It interacts with merlin ( NF2 tumor suppressor ) , ezrin , radixin , and moesin ( MERM proteins ) , which are involved in cytoskeletal reorganization and signal transduction ( 21 ) . Another putative linker that is repressed is ABLIM - 1 ( Fig . 4 A ) , which binds F - actin via its villin headpiece and has been suggested to function in signaling pathways through its LIM domain ( 22 ) . EPLIN would promote the formation of stable actin filament structures at the expense of more dynamic actin filament structures ( 23 ) , and reduction in expression of EPLIN , as is observed here under the influence of hSnail , may contribute to the motility of invasive tumor cells . Identification of human Snail target genes by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis . Next , we wanted to evaluate whether hSnail was able to directly repress the genes identified in our microarray analysis . For this purpose , the DLD - 1TR21 cell line was retrovirally transduced with an EGFP - hSnail fusion construct . Real - time quantitative reverse transcription - PCR ( RT - PCR ) of a subset of sequence verified cDNAs confirmed their repression in the cells expressing EGFP - hSnail ( Fig . 4 A ) . These quantitative RT - PCRs together with the Northern experiments validated without exception > 10 % of the microarray data for corresponding genes with diverging levels of signal ratios . Consequently , the complete list of differentially expressed genes can be considered largely reliable . We analyzed in more detail the promoters of 11 genes identified in the microarray analysis ( Fig . 4 B ) . The depicted promoters have E - boxes close to the transcription initiation site . E - boxes are the characterized binding sites for Snail family members , as was already showed by in vitro experiments using promoter reporter constructs for several genes , such as E - cadherin ( 4 , 5 ) , claudins , and occludins ( 7 ) . Using EGFP - and Figure 3 . Modulation of the cytoskeleton by hSnail . A , Northern blot analysis of a set of keratin genes down - regulated by hSnail .

Rab25 is a small GTP - binding protein with an epithelial distribution . It is associated with the apical recycling system , through which polarized epithelial cells maintain the polarized distribution of basolateral and apical membrane proteins ( 24 ) . Binding to the E - cadherin promoter ( CDH1 ) could be detected as well . Because of the low repression capacity of hSnail on this promoter , we suggest that other cell - specific corepressors are needed for complete shutdown of the E - cadherin transcription . Furthermore , binding of hSnail to the promoters of PFKP and SLC27A2 was also shown , suggesting that other pathways including lipid and carbohydrate metabolism could also be involved in the dediffer - entiation of cells . The data we obtained from a genome - wide screening for target genes not only give a comprehensive view of the thorough impact of hSnail on epithelial differentiation , they also offer new candidate genes that are putatively involved in invasion and metastasis .
