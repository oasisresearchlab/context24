Spudich , Stanford University School of Medicine , Stanford , CA , and approved August 26 , 2015 ( received for review May 1 , 2015 ) Single cardiomyocytes contain myofibrils that harbor the sarcomere - based contractile machinery of the myocardium . Cardiomyocytes differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells ( hPSC - CMs ) have potential as an in vitro model of heart activity . However , their fetal - like misalignment of myofibrils limits their usefulness for modeling contractile activity . We analyzed the effects of cell shape and sub - strate stiffness on the shortening and movement of labeled sarco - meres and the translation of sarcomere activity to mechanical output ( contractility ) in live engineered hPSC - CMs . Single hPSC - CMs were cultured on polyacrylamide substrates of physiological stiffness ( 10 kPa ) , and Matrigel micropatterns were used to generate physio - logical shapes ( 2 , 000 - μ m 2 rectangles with length : width aspect ratios of 5 : 1 – 7 : 1 ) and a mature alignment of myofibrils . Translation of sarcomere shortening to mechanical output was highest in 7 : 1 hPSC - CMs . Increased substrate stiffness and applied overstretch induced myofibril defects in 7 : 1 hPSC - CMs and decreased mechan - ical output . Inhibitors of nonmuscle myosin activity repressed the assembly of myofibrils , showing that subcellular tension drives the improved contractile activity in these engineered hPSC - CMs . Other factors associated with improved contractility were axially directed calcium flow , systematic mitochondrial distribution , more mature electrophysiology , and evidence of transverse - tubule for - mation . These findings support the potential of these engineered hPSC - CMs as powerful models for studying myocardial contractil - ity at the cellular level . contractility | sarcomeres | cardiomyocyte | stem cell | single cell M yocardial contractility is essential for heart function . Dis - ruption of the contractile activity of heart muscle cells , cardiomyocytes ( CMs ) , can lead to heart disease , and altering CM contractility is a common approach to treating a failing heart ( 1 ) . Single CMs contain all of the machinery involved in myo - cardial contractility ( 2 ) , which consists of sarcomeres in series that shorten along myofibrils as a result of myosin activity ( 3 ) . Sarcomeric myosins convert the chemical energy of ATP into mechanical energy ( 4 ) upon binding to actin thin filaments and promote sarcomere shortening . Each sarcomere occupies the space between Z lines ( 5 ) , and collective shortening of sarcomeres translates to mechanical output in the CM contractile cycle . CMs differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells ( hPSC - CMs ) have potential for studying heart disease ( 6 ) . Specifically , hPSC - CMs can model myocardial physiology in vitro ( 7 ) . hPSC - CMs may be better in vitro models of contractility than neonatal or mature murine primary CMs , because they can be maintained in culture longer ( 2 ) and because the sarcomeric contractile ma - chinery differs between human and murine CMs ( 8 , 9 ) . However , hPSC - CMs derived from current differentiation protocols present myofibril alignment resembling that of fetal CMs , limiting their ability to replicate the contractility of primary adult CMs ( 6 ) . Microfabrication techniques can engineer hPSC - CMs to develop systems in which cell properties and function match physiological properties ( 10 , 11 ) . Engineered multicellular cultures of hPSC - CMs can model cardiac contractility ( 10 , 11 ) but are limited by cell - to - cell variations in myocyte type ( atrial , ventricular , and nodal ) , cell size , shape , and myofibril alignment , which can lead to in - accurate measurements of contractile output ( 12 ) . To create a mature alignment of myofibrils , we cultured single hPSC - CMs on polyacrylamide substrates of physiological stiff - ness ( 10 kPa ) ( 13 ) with rectangular 2 , 000 - μ m 2 Matrigel micro - patterns and aspect ratios ( length to width ) of 3 : 1 – 7 : 1 . Matrigel is an extracellular matrix mixture ( 14 ) , and CMs assume the shape of micropatterns of extracellular proteins printed on surfaces ( 11 , 15 , 16 ) . A rectangular shape of hPSC - CMs with a physio - logical aspect ratio of 7 : 1 and area of 2 , 000 μ m 2 engineers a physiological organization of sarcomeres ( 11 ) , with myofibrils aligned along the main cell axis , as in primary adult murine CMs ( 17 ) . Culturing primary neonatal murine CMs on substrates with a physiological stiffness ( ∼ 10 kPa ) leads to mature myofibril organization and cell function ( 13 , 18 ) . Significance Human cardiomyocytes differentiated from pluripotent stem cells ( hPSC - CMs ) have potential as in vitro models of cardiac health and disease but differ from mature cardiomyocytes . In single live engineered hPSC - CMs with physiological shapes , we assayed the mechanical output and activity of sarcomeres and myofibrils in a nondestructive , noninvasive manner . Substrates with physiological stiffness improved contractile activity of patterned hPSC - CMs , as well as calcium flow , mitochondrial organization , electrophysiology , and transverse - tubule forma - tion . The mechanical output and activity of sarcomeres and myofibrils varied as a function of mechanical cues and dis - rupted cell tension . This study establishes a high - throughput platform for modeling single - cell cardiac contractile activity and yields insight into environmental factors that drive matu - ration and sarcomere function in hPSC - CMs .

Our goals were ( i ) to determine whether sarcomere activity affects contractility as a function of cell shape and substrate stiffness , and ( ii ) to understand how these cues regulate contractility . We calcu - lated the mechanical output of beating hPSC - CMs and simulta - neously imaged fluorescently labeled actin to quantify myofibril organization and sarcomere dynamics . We then tested the effects of substrate stiffness and subcellular tension on the mechanical output and myofibril organization of engineered hPSC - CMs . We also assayed calcium flow , mitochondrial organization , electrophysiol - ogy , and the presence of transverse - tubule ( t - tubule ) structures . Results Increased Myofibril Alignment Improves Sarcomere Activity and Mechanical Output . To induce a mature alignment of myofibrils in single hPSC - CMs on 10 - kPa polyacrylamide substrates ( SI Appendix , Fig . S1 and SI Materials and Methods ) , we cultured hPSC - CMs on rectangular 2 , 000 - μ m 2 Matrigel micropatterns with aspect ratios of 3 : 1 – 7 : 1 . Single hPSC - CMs attached to the micropatterns and as - sumed their shapes ( Fig . 1 A , SI Appendix , Fig . S2 , and Movies S1 and S2 ) . Unpatterned hPSC - CMs and hPSC - CMs on square pat - terns ( 1 : 1 ) with a constant area of 2 , 000 μ m 2 were also cultured ( Fig . 1 ) . To reveal sarcomeres along myofibrils ( Fig . 1 B and SI Appendix , Fig . S3 ) , we labeled F - actin with Lifeact ( 19 ) . Increasing the aspect ratio of patterns progressively increased myofibril alignment ( Fig . 1 B ) . In these engineered hPSC - CMs , sarcomeres laterally registered with sarcomeres in neighboring myofibrils , inducing intersarcomeric alignment of Z lines perpendicular to the di - rection of myofibril alignment ( SI Appendix , Fig . S2 ) , as in pat - terned neonatal murine CMs ( 20 , 21 ) and hPSC - CMs patterned on glass ( 11 ) . However , in unpatterned and square hPSC - CMs , myofibrils had random directionality . The sum of hPSC - CM contractile force magnitudes ( Σ j F c j ) ( Figs . 1 C and 2 A ) , work , and power ( SI Appendix , Fig . S4 ) increased with cell aspect ratio . Unpatterned contractile cells had random shapes , and their Σ j F c j increased with adhesion area ( SI Appendix , Fig . S5 A ) . Unpatterned ∼ 2 , 000 - μ m 2 hPSC - CMs had the same Σ j F c j as 1 : 1 hPSC - CMs . Unpatterned > 2 , 000 - μ m 2 hPSC - CMs generated Σ j F c j similar to 3 : 1 engineered hPSC - CMs . Aspect ratio did not affect the mean cell - shortening velocity ( SI Appendix , Fig . S5 B ) . Because power scales with velocity , differences in the power output of these cells mainly reflected differences in Σ j F c j . In engineered hPSC - CMs , power varied exponentially with Σ j F c j , independent of aspect ratio ( SI Appendix , Fig . S5 C ) . Calculation of the maximal velocity of microbead displacement during cell contraction ( V C ) and cell relaxation ( V R ) showed that V C and V R increased with the cell aspect ratio ( SI Appendix , Fig . S5 D ) , possibly due to differences in cell contractility . Evidently , improved sarcomere activity drives the greater mechanical output of engineered hPSC - CMs . Next , we determined whether the effects of cell shape on me - chanical output are independent of different dynamics and orga - nization of sarcomeres and myofibrils . In primary adult CMs , sarcomeres are ∼ 2 . 2 μ m apart between Z lines when relaxed ( 6 ) , contract along the CM major axis , and register with one another across parallel myofibrils ( 22 ) . Fixed cells contained α - actinin colocalized with periodic dark bands along Lifeact - labeled myofibrils , validating those regions as bona fide Z lines ( SI Appendix , Fig . S3 ) . To simultaneously measure the mechanical output and dynamics of sarcomeres , we acquired videos of engineered hPSC - CMs with Lifeact - labeled ( 19 ) myofibrils contracting under electrical field stimulation at 1 Hz ( Fig . 2 B and Movies S3 and S4 ) . Labeling did not alter Σ j F c j ( SI Appendix , Fig . S6 A ) . Sarcomere shortening was calculated as the difference between sarcomere length when hPSC - CMs were contracted and relaxed ( Fig . 2 B and SI Appendix , Fig . S7 ) . Interestingly , Σ j F c j per μ m of shortening increased with cell Fig . 1 .

S6 B ) . Thus , we asked whether myofibril and sarcomere alignment increased with aspect ratio to more efficiently translate sarcomere shortening to mechanical output . Using particle - tracking velocimetry , we quantified myofibril movement in 7 : 1 engineered hPSC - CMs along the cell major ( x ) and minor axes ( y ) ( SI Appendix , Fig . S8 ) by tracking actin movement between the relaxed and contracted states . We then calculated the displacement ratio [ u ( x ) / v ( y ) ] of myofibrils for single hPSC - CMs with different aspect ratios ( Fig . 2 D ) . Overall movement of myofibrils along the major axis was greatest in 7 : 1 hPSC - CMs . Increased myofibril motion [ u ( x ) ] and increased myofibril alignment induced sarcomere shortening to maximize the axial contractile output of engineered hPSC - CMs . High myofibril alignment along the major axis is a hallmark of CM maturity ( 6 ) , and the myofibril alignment index ( AI ) also in - creased with the aspect ratio ( Fig . 2 E ) . Cell Shape and Substrate Stiffness Coordinate the Contractile Machinery by a Tuned Tension Mechanism . Along with cell shape , substrate stiff - ness affects the cytoskeleton ( 23 ) and mechanical phenotypes of cells ( 24 , 25 ) and may regulate the mechanical output of engineered hPSC - CMs . Generally , tension along the cell membrane increases with the aspect ratio of adherent cells ( 26 ) . Intracellular tension also increases with substrate stiffness ( 27 , 28 ) , and the contractility of primary neonatal murine CMs varies with substrate stiffness ( 18 , 29 ) . We used multiple approaches to test the idea that tension varies with shape and substrate stiffness and regulates changes in the contractile output of our engineered hPSC - CMs . To test the effect of substrate stiffness , we made different hydrogels with the stiffness of embryonic myocardium ( 6 kPa ) , healthy myocardium ( 10 kPa ) , and ischemic or fibrotic myocardium ( 35 kPa ) ( 13 ) . When cultured on 35 - kPa hydrogels , engineered hPSC - CMs generated 90 % less Σ j F c j than on 6 - and 10 - kPa hydrogels ( Fig . 3 A ) . On 35 - kPa hydrogels , 7 : 1 hPSC - CMs generated higher Σ j F c j than 5 : 1 hPSC - CMs ; however , on 6 - kPa hydrogels , Σ j F c j did not differ between 7 : 1 and 5 : 1 hPSC - CMs ( Fig . 3 A ) . Mechanical output was highest on hydrogels with the stiffness of healthy myocardium ( 6 and 10 kPa ) . However , intracellular tension also decreases with decreasing substrate stiffness ( 27 ) , and fewer engineered hPSC - CMs on 6 - kPa hydrogels retained their myo - fibril organization over the contractile cycle but instead exhibited myofibril buckling during relaxation ( SI Appendix , Fig . S9 and Movies S5 – S8 ) . Cells with laterally registered sarcomeres had less myofibril buckling ( Movie S9 ) . We next tested whether de - creased Σ j F c j on 35 - kPa hydrogels also correlated with myofibril disorganization . Myofibrils exhibited discontinuities and were disrupted in ∼ 25 % of cells on 35 - kPa hydrogels ( Fig . 3 B and SI Appendix , Fig . S10 ) but not on 6 - or 10 - kPa substrates . To test the hypothesis that tension increased above a threshold by stiffer substrates leads to myofibril rupture and decreased mechanical output , we stretched engineered hPSC - CMs with a glass rod to shear the hydrogel proximal to a cell and measured the contractile power output vs . stretch ( SI Appendix , Fig . S11 ) . Cell power increased for stretches of 5 – 10 % cellular strain but myofibrils ruptured at 14 % strain ( Fig . 3 C ) . Above 14 % strain , cells stopped beating or power output decreased . In healthy myocardium , physiological strains up to 10 % increase mechani - cal output ( 17 ) ; primary CMs also only increase output over a limited range of tension ( 30 ) , above which sarcomere activity also decreases ( 31 ) . Thus , we asked whether contractility is necessary to drive myofibril rupture in our overloaded cells . Consistent with prior reports ( 11 ) , myofibrils did not rupture when engineered hPSC - CMs were cultured on glass , where sarcomeres twitched but cells did not shorten with beating ( SI Appendix , Fig . S12 and Movie S10 ) . To further test the idea that mechanical output decreases on 35 kPa because higher intracellular tension decreases sarcomere and myofibril activity , we increased contractile activity by in - creasing the extracellular calcium concentration ( SI Appendix , Fig . S13 A ) ( 32 ) . The fraction of hPSC - CMs with disrupted myofibrils ( SI Appendix , Fig . S13 B and Movies S11 and S12 ) increased to 50 % ( SI Appendix , Fig . S13 D ) . To determine whether intracellular tension is needed to main - tain myofibril alignment , we incubated patterned hPSC - CMs in EDTA to chelate calcium and reduce integrin - mediated cell - sub - strate adhesion ( 33 , 34 ) and disrupt myofibril tension ( 35 ) and the intracellular balance of forces . Beating stopped upon EDTA ad - dition , whereas buckling , disruption , and loosening of myofibrils and loss of sarcomere periodic organization increased with in - cubation ( SI Appendix , Fig . S14 ) . hPSC - CMs with high myofibril density and sarcomere registration ( SI Appendix , Fig . S15 ) resisted myofibril damage and detachment from the substrate for > 1 h . To determine whether myofibrils realign as adhesion and in - tracellular tension recover , we induced myofibril defects with short - term EDTA incubation and added fresh medium . Myofi - bril alignment recovered in just 4 h ( SI Appendix , Fig . S16 ) . We repeated this experiment but added small molecules to the new medium to abrogate intracellular tension . We inhibited cytoskele - ton polymerization ( nocodazole for microtubules and cytochalasin D for F - actin ) or intracellular tension ( blebbistatin to block non - muscle myosin II binding to actin , ML - 7 to inhibit nonmuscle my - osin light - chain kinase , or BDM to inhibit ATPase of nonmuscle myosin ) . In the presence of nocodazole , myofibrils realigned after Fig . 3 . Substrate stiffness and substrate stretching affect the myofibril in - tegrity and mechanical output of engineered hPSC - CMs .

S17 B ) , as did bleb - bistatin , ML - 7 , and BDM ( SI Appendix , Fig . S18 ) . Cells without EDTA - induced myofibril defects shortened when incubated with ML - 7 or BDM for 4 h but their myofibril organization changed little ( SI Appendix , Fig . S19 ) . Thus , tuned intracellular tension mediated by actomyosin activity is necessary for myofibril align - ment . A 7 : 1 aspect ratio and substrate stiffness of 10 kPa develop the required tension for hPSC - CMs to establish mature myofibrils and contractile function . We next examined expression of titin , which regulates tension along myofibrils ( 36 , 37 ) , and troponin I ( TnI ) and troponin T ( TnT ) , which regulate sarcomere contraction ( 38 , 39 ) . We com - pared expression of TnI , TnT , and titin isoforms ( N2A and N2B ) in unpatterned hPSC - CMs on 10 - kPa hydrogels vs . patterned on glass and 10 - and 35 - kPa hydrogels ( SI Appendix , Fig . S20 ) . Titin expression did not change in cells patterned on 10 and 35 kPa but differed significantly on patterned and unpatterned hydrogels and patterned hydrogels and glass . N2A expression was highest on unpatterned hydrogels and patterned glass ; N2B expression was higher on glass than on unpatterned hydrogels . TnT expression was highest on glass but similar in patterned and unpatterned hydrogels , whereas TnI expression was significantly higher on patterned hydrogels than on glass or unpatterned hydrogels . These results support the notion that substrate stiffness and cell shape act cooperatively to regulate the function of hPSC - CMs via mechanisms known to tune sarcomere tension and contractility . Improved Mechanical Activity of Sarcomeres Enhances Other Maturity Metrics . Engineered hPSC - CMs have more physiological myofi - bril alignment , sarcomere lateral registry , cell shape , and direction of contractile movement than unpatterned hPSC - CMs ( Figs . 1 – 3 ) . However , calcium signaling , mitochondrial organization , electro - physiology , gene expression , and t - tubule formation also define the maturity of primary CMs ( 6 , 10 ) . Intracellular calcium regu - lates cardiac contractility and flows along the major axis of beating primary adult CMs to trigger contractility ( 40 ) . We saw that cal - cium flow propagates anisotropically along the major axis in engineered hPSC - CMs but isotropically in unpatterned cells ( Fig . 4 A ) . Mitochondria were systematically distributed in engineered hPSC - CMs , with higher concentrations around the perinuclear space and cell extremities , but were sparse and randomly distrib - uted in unpatterned hPSC - CMs ( Fig . 4 B and SI Appendix , Fig . S21 ) ( 6 ) . In primary CMs , mitochondria are homogeneously dis - tributed and occupy up to 60 % of the cell volume ( 41 ) . To analyze electrophysiology , we made patch - clamp recordings from single cells ( Fig . 4 C ) . The maturity and type ( ventricular , atrial , or nodal ) of primary CMs are reflected in the temporal profile of action potentials during contractions . We evaluated hPSC - CMs with a ventricular profile , a cell fate of interest for modeling cardiac activity ( 42 ) . The engineered cells had lower resting membrane potential , higher action potential amplitude , and higher maximum upstroke velocity than unpatterned cells ( Fig . 4 C ) and were thus more similar to ventricular CMs . Next , we used single - cell quantitative ( q ) RT - PCR to quantify the relative expression of cardiac maturation genes encoding ion chan - nels , transcription factors , and sarcomere proteins . These genes were expressed at similar levels in engineered and unpatterned single hPSC - CMs ( Fig . 4 D ) . Thus , the greater maturity of engineered hPSC - CMs was not associated with changes in the expression of Fig . 4 . hPSC - CMs on 7 : 1 patterns have phenotypes similar to those of mature CMs .

Primary adult CMs have t - tubules — deep invaginations of the sarcolemma ( 43 ) that organize periodically like Z lines and have only been seen in hPSC - CMs in engineered micro - tissues ( 32 ) . Engineered single hPSC - CMs had t - tubule – like structures distributed along the cell membrane ( Fig . 4 E ) , sug - gesting that improved sarcomere and myofibril maturity are coupled to other maturity markers . Discussion This study shows that physiological shape and substrate stiffness increase the translation of sarcomere shortening to mechanical output in hPSC - CMs by setting the necessary intracellular ten - sion that regulates contractility and establishes and maintains myofibril alignment . Sarcomere activity and myofibril alignment were highest in engineered 7 : 1 hPSC - CMs , which resembled mature CMs in their electrophysiology , direction of calcium flow , organization of mitochondria , and presence of t - tubules . Greater cell maturity seemed to correlate with improved mechanical activity of sarcomeres . Our findings suggest that engineered hPSC - CMs are a biologically suitable model for studying the contractility of human CMs . Our engineered hPSC - CMs had Σ j F c j similar to that of primary adult CMs ( micronewton range ) ( 44 ) when the extracellular con - centration of calcium was increased ( SI Appendix , Fig . S13 A ) . Otherwise , Σ j F c j of 7 : 1 hPSC - CMs was similar to maximal values reported in other studies of single hPSC - CMs ( 0 . 1 – 500 nN ) ( 45 , 46 ) , possibly reflecting the use of different force - measuring tech - niques and improved myofibril alignment . Sarcomere length varies with cell aspect ratio in murine neonatal CMs micropatterned on glass ( 16 , 20 ) . However , we observed physiological sarcomere lengths around 2 μ m and detected no difference in sarcomere length for aspect ratios from 3 : 1 to 7 : 1 . This may be due to sar - comeric differences of human and murine CMs ( 8 , 9 ) . Overall , cell function improved with physiological shape on substrates with physiological stiffness ( 10 kPa ) . The stiffness of primary adult murine CMs is 10 – 40 kPa ( 47 ) , which matches the stiffness of our hydrogels . In contrast , engineered cells on 6 - and 35 - kPa substrates had defects in myofibril organization through overtension and myofibril rupture ( 35 kPa ) or undertension and myofibril buckling ( 6 kPa ) ( 48 ) . Previous studies found that 10 - kPa substrates yield useful cultures of immature primary neo - natal murine CMs with physiological shape ( 21 , 23 ) . Increasing substrate stiffness without controlling cell shape increases the force output of neonatal murine CMs ( 25 ) and unpatterned hPSC - CMs ( 24 ) . We found that variations in stiffness affect the mechanical output of engineered hPSC - CMs by changing myofibril function . Thus , hPSC - CMs grown without shape constraints may adapt to increased substrate stiffness and the resultant increase in in - tracellular tension by varying their shape and myofibril organi - zation to balance intracellular forces ( 35 ) . Our observations support the idea that physiological substrate stiffness and cell shape tune the distribution of intracellular tension necessary for physiological sarcomere activity and me - chanical output of hPSC - CMs . Tension is tuned by myofibril alignment and distribution and strength of cell adhesion , which are set by cell shape and substrate stiffness . Tension is also tuned by modified expression and activity of contractile and structural genes downstream of myofibril organization and cell adhesion . The assembly of actin filaments into contractile stress fibers follows a mechanism common among adherent cell types ( 49 ) , and actin stress fiber alignment is also seen in other cell types patterned into rectangular shapes ( 26 , 50 , 51 ) . Nonmuscle actin stress fibers have several homologies with their myofibril iso - forms in contractility , organization , and composition ( 49 , 52 , 53 ) . Nonmuscle actin fibers also develop as bipolar linear structures with periodically distributed clusters of α - actinin and myosin ( 54 – 56 ) . In developing myocytes , premyofibrils , a muscle - specific type of actin stress fiber , interact with the cell membrane ( 57 – 59 ) and evolve into myofibrils . A rectangular shape prealigns the cell membrane along what will be the major contractile axis . In our engineered hPSC - CMs , mature myofibrils were highly concen - trated near the cell membrane and tension was required to es - tablish and maintain myofibril alignment and organization . Intracellular tension was downstream of myofibril distribution and density , actomyosin activity , and cell - adhesion strength ( SI Appendix , Figs . S14 – S19 ) . Cell adhesions in the extremities of engineered hPSC - CMs anchor myofibrils to the substrate and regulate the tension necessary for contractile function . For adherent cells in general , a rectangular cell shape strengthens substrate adhesions at the extremities ( 60 , 61 ) . Intracellular tension increases with the aspect ratio of cells and is necessary for strong adhesions in cell extremities ( 26 ) . Substrate stiffness regulates the strength , activity , and stability of cell adhesions to the substrate , and their strength is reflected in the development of intracellular tension to maintain equilibrium of forces ( 62 – 64 ) . Our findings are consistent with these observations and with evidence that sarcomere activity in cardiac muscle is regulated by intracellular tension of CMs ( 30 , 31 , 65 ) . The recovery of myofibril alignment after loss of intracellular tension and contractility upon calcium chelation shows a role for shape - and substrate - induced tension in driving myofibrillogenesis and enhanced maturity . The inhibition of tension with small - mol - ecule inhibitors of the actin cytoskeleton and contractility further support the idea that these mechanisms of tension generation are essential for myofibril maturation ( SI Appendix , Figs . S17 – S19 ) . The intracellular tension and contractility of primary CMs also depend on these intra - and extrasarcomeric cytoskeletal structures ( 1 , 31 , 36 , 39 ) . The expression levels of titin isoforms ( N2A and N2B ) and TnI and TnT differed in cultures of 7 : 1 hPSC - CMs on polyacrylamide vs . glass ( SI Appendix , Fig . S20 ) and in patterned vs . unpatterned cells . Thus , cells may actively regulate sarcomere proteins to tune tension on these different substrates . Interestingly , the up - regulation of troponins is a marker of heart failure ( 66 ) . The differential expression of TnT relative to TnI in heart disease ( 67 ) supports the idea that differences in their expression are related to CM function . Further study is needed to understand how stiffness and shape regulate the expression of sarcomere proteins . We expected force to scale with cellular cross - sectional area , and the number of sarcomeres in parallel and velocity to scale with the number of sarcomeres in series . However , we found that contrac - tion velocities are similar across the different cellular aspect ratio . Thus , power scales only with force , which may be due to the con - stant cell spread area ( 2 , 000 μ m 2 ) and imaging at one focal plane . In addition , the alignment and organization of myofibrils are different between hPSC - CMs with different aspect ratios , which affects the translation of sarcomere shortening to force between these cells . Future work should explore variations in cell volume with aspect ratio and spread area , as well as quantification of sarcomeres in patterned hPSC - CMs . Studies of varied volumes and edge shapes will also enable us to test whether increased membrane tension provides the structural cues ( 68 ) needed for t - tubule formation ( 69 ) . Our findings , along with the developed methods and plat - forms , will facilitate studies to understand the biomechanics of engineered hPSC - CMs and their use as models of human heart physiology to elucidate CM function and test hypotheses about the causes of heart diseases .

Pruitt , pruitt @ stanford . edu Ribeiro et al . : Supporting Information / 2 SI Materials and Methods Fabrication of Polyacrylamide Hydrogel Devices with Matrigel Micropatterns Cardiomyocytes ( CMs ) derived from human pluripotent stem cells ( hPSC - CMs ) were cultured on 2000 µ m 2 rectangular patterns of Matrigel ( BD Matrigel hESC - qualified Matrix , BD Biosciences ) on polyacrylamide hydrogels ( Fig . S1 ) . The cells attach to the Matrigel on patterned regions but not to the regions surrounding the patterns , which sterically hinder protein adsorption and assume the shape of the Matrigel micropatterns . Matrigel micropatterns were initially stamped on glass coverslips by microcontact printing with microstamps inked with Matrigel and transferred from the micropatterned glass coverslips onto the surface of polyacrylamide hydrogels . To manufacture elastomeric microstamps of polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ; PDMS - 182 , Sylgard ) for microcontact printing , we used standard soft lithography and microfabrication techniques ( 1 ) . The microstamp areas ( 1 . 5 cm x 1 . 5 cm ) contained arrays of 2000 - µ m 2 rectangular features with aspect ratios of 1 : 1 to 7 : 1 , spaced 50 – 100 µ m apart . We also patterned hPSC - CMs with aspect ratios of 9 : 1 and 11 : 1 , however , these cells rarely contracted and thus were not analyzed . Multiple microstamp designs were printed at 40 , 000 dpi resolution on transparency masks ( FineLine Imaging ) . We fabricated 2 . 5 - dimension microstamp molds using a 10 - µ m layer of negative photoresist ( SU - 8 3010 , Microchem ) on mechanical - grade , silicon wafers ( ø10 cm , University Wafer ) . Each wafer was mounted on a spin - coater ( Laurel Technologies ) and SU - 8 negative photoresist was added to cover the surface of the wafer . The wafer was spun at 300 rpm for 10 s and at 1000 rpm for 30 s and baked on a hotplate with a temperature cycle of 30 ° C to 95 ° C at 4 ° C / min , 95 ° C for 6 min and 95 ° C to 30 ° C at 4 ° C / min . After incubation in a closed container for 15 min at room temperature , the wafer was exposed to 20 mW / cm 2 light ( OAI collimated light source centered at 365 nm ) for 10 s through a high - pass ultraviolet filter ( PL - 360 - LP , Omega Optical ) with the transparency mask described above . Then each wafer was baked on a hotplate with a temperature cycle of 30 ° C to 95 ° C at 4 ° C / min , 95 ° C for 4 min and 95 ° C to 30 ° C at 4 ° C / min . After incubation in a closed container for 15 min at room temperature , each wafer was placed in a beaker containing SU - 8 developer ( Microchem ) for 6 min with constant swirling . A stream of new developer was squirted onto the wafers for 15 s every minute to enhance removal of undeveloped SU - 8 . These SU - 8 microstamp molds were dried with N 2 gas and then cast with PDMS . For preparation of PDMS - 184 ( Sylgard - 184 ) , prepolymer and curing agent ( 10 : 1 ) were mixed and degassed in a Thinky mixer . PDMS was then poured on the molds , degassed in a bell jar for 1 h and cured in a 70°C oven for 24 h . After curing , the solidified layer of PDMS was carefully peeled from the molds and stamps areas ( 1 . 5 cm x 1 . 5 cm ) were cut from the PDMS layer . The surface of each PDMS stamp was incubated with Matrigel diluted 1 : 10 in L - 15 medium ( Invitrogen ) at 4°C overnight , washed twice with L - 15 medium and gently dried with N 2 gas . Glass coverslips were sterilized in an oxygen plasma asher ( Branson IPC / Novellus ) as described elsewhere ( 2 ) . To microcontact print protein to clean coverslips ( VWR ; 12 or 18 - mm - diameter ) , the microstamps were placed pattern - side down and weighted ( 50 g ) for 2 min . The weight was removed and , after a 3 - min rest , the microstamp was carefully removed to ensure precise transfer of the Matrigel micropatterns to the coverslips ( 3 ) . Ribeiro et al . : Supporting Information / 3 We silane - treated other glass coverslips or glass dishes to bind the base of polyacrylamide hydrogel substrates ( 3 ) . Clean glass coverslips ( 12 , 18 , or 25 mm ; VWR ) and glass - bottom dishes ( MatTek Corp . ) were treated with 0 . 4 % 3 - ( trimethoxysilyl ) propyl methacrylate ( Sigma ) in Milli - Q water , pH 3 . 5 , for 1 h , washed six times with Milli - Q water and dried with N 2 gas ( 4 ) . These surfaces support and stabilize the hydrogel substrates for handling , cell culture and cell analysis . To fabricate hydrogel devices , we polymerized polyacrylamide at room temperature between the Matrigel - micropatterned glass coverslips and the silane - treated glass coverslips or dishes ( 3 ) . Prepolymer solutions of acrylamide ( Sigma ) ( 10 % w / v ) , bisacrylamide ( Sigma ) ( 0 . 05 – 0 . 3 % w / v ) , ammonium persulfate ( Sigma ) ( 0 . 1 % w / v ) , N , N , N ′ , N ′ - tetramethylethylenediamine ( Sigma ) ( 0 . 1 % v / v ) , HEPES ( Life Technologies ) ( 35 mM ) and Milli - Q water were mixed . To vary the stiffness of the hydrogels , different concentration of bisacrylamide were used in the prepolymer solutions : 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) for 10 kPa ( 5 , 6 ) , 0 . 05 % for 6 kPa and 0 . 3 % ( w / v ) for 35 kPa ( 6 ) . For hydrogel devices used to assess mechanical output in single hPSC - CMs by traction force microscopy ( see below ) , fluorescent microbeads ( diameter 0 . 5 µ m , Life Technologies ) were added to the prepolymer solution ( 7 ) . Stock microbead solution ( 30 mL ) was sonicated for 15 min and mixed with 90 µ L of Milli - Q water ; 86 µ L of this solution was added to each milliliter of gel prepolymer solution to yield a final concentration of 6 . 25 × 10 9 microbeads / mL . Finally , the prepolymer solution was placed in the center of each silane - treated glass coverslip ( 12 , 18 , or 25 mm ) or glass - bottom dish and each micropatterned glass coverslip was placed on top of the prepolymer solution . The prepolymer solution gelled after 15 min of incubation at room temperature . We used 15 µ L of prepolymer solution for 12 - mm stamped coverslips and 40 µ L for 18 - mm stamped coverslips . The gel was sandwiched between the stamped and silane - treated coverslips . ( Fig . S1 ) . After 15 min , the hydrogel was placed in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) ( Life Technologies ) , pH 7 . 2 , for at least 1 h to hydrate and the top stamped coverslip was gently removed with a razor blade . Micropatterns on the micropatterned glass were transferred to the hydrogel surface . At this point , the micropatterned hydrogel device was ready for seeding cells . Cells assume the shape of Matrigel micropatterns on polyacrylamide hydrogel substrates . However , Matrigel is not fluorescent and is not easily observed on the surface of hydrogel substrates . To illustrate how protein micropatterns are present on the surface of polyacrylamide hydrogel - based devices after being transferred from microprinted glass coverslips , we micropatterned fluorescent gelatin from pig skin ( Oregon green conjugated ; Life Technologies ) on the surface of polyacrylamide with embedded red fluorescent microbeads ( 4 ) ( Life Technologies ) , following the protocol described above ( Fig . S1 ) . Cells were also cultured on glass micropatterned with Matrigel . The glass surface was microcontact printed with Matrigel microstamps as described above and washed six times with Milli - Q water . Then , 0 . 1 mg / mL poly ( L - lysine ) - g - poly ( ethylene glycol ) ( Surface Solutions , Switzerland , PLL ( 20 ) - g [ 3 . 6 ] - PEG ( 2 ) ) in PBS , pH 7 . 4 , was added by immersion for 1 h ( 1 ) . This solution was removed from the glass substrates by serial dilution in PBS ( 1 : 4 , six times ) . The devices were used immediately for cell culture or stored in PBS for no more than 4 days before use . Ribeiro et al . : Supporting Information / 4 Differentiation , Purification and Culture of Engineered hPSC - CMs We engineered and analyzed cells from a single differentiation batch . H7 human embryonic stem cells ( NIH Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry ) were differentiated into spontaneously beating monolayers of hPSC - CMs with a small - molecule - mediated , Wnt - modulating protocol ( 8 ) . This protocol yields cells that express α - actinin , cardiac troponin T and the α - myosin heavy chain ; populations consist of up to 77 % hPSC - CMs that express cardiac troponin T at high levels ( 8 ) . The proportion of hPSC - CMs was increased to 90 – 95 % by glucose depletion and use of lactate as the carbon source ( 9 ) . Cells were frozen in fetal bovine serum ( Life Technologies ) with 10 µ M Y27623 ROCK inhibitor ( Stemcell Technologies ) and 10 % dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) for later use . Cells were thawed in the wells of sterile six - well culture plates coated with fibronectin from bovine serum ( Sigma ) and cultured in RPMI - 1640 medium plus B27 supplement ( 50X ) , penicillin ( 25 µ g / mL ) and streptomycin ( 50 µ g / mL ) ( all from Life Technologies ) with 5 µ M Y27623 ROCK inhibitor . After 2 days of culture , culture medium without ROCK inhibitor was added and the cells were allowed to recover from thawing for 2 more days . hPSC - CMs were passaged onto Matrigel - patterned hydrogel devices in six - well culture plates ; cultures were passaged when most of the cells were actively contracting . Cultures were washed with PBS and Accutase ( 0 . 5 mL , Millipore ) was added at 37°C . After 8 – 10 min , when the cells had detached from the bottom of the wells , the Accutase was quenched with Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10 % fetal bovine serum . The cells were gently re - suspended as a single - cell suspension and the cell concentration was determined with a hemocytometer . The cell solution was centrifuged at 83 rcf for 3 min at room temperature , the supernatant was aspirated and the cell pellet was re - suspended in enough medium ( RPMI - 1640 cell - culture medium with 5 µ M ROCK inhibitor ) to allow addition of 100 µ L of the cell solution to hydrogels at a concentration of 1000 cells / cm 2 . After 1 h of incubation , medium was added to cover the substrates . Within 1 h , cells had attached only to regions patterned with Matrigel ( Fig . 1 , S1 and S2 ) . After 2 days of culture , fresh medium without ROCK inhibitor was added and changed every 2 days . Cell phenotypes were assessed after 9 days of culture , when most engineered cells were beating spontaneously . Fluorescence Labeling and Visualization of Live and Fixed Cells To label actin with LifeAct , a small peptide that labels F - actin in live cells ( 10 ) , we incubated hPSC - CMs with the adenovirus rAV CAG - LifeAct - TagRFP ( Ibidi ; 1 × 10 5 IU / mL in RPMI - 1640 cell - culture medium ) overnight at 37°C in a humid 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . The cells were washed once with PBS at 37°C and new medium was added . Myofibrils were labeled in cells after 2 days ( Fig . S3 ) . To image calcium flow , we used the Fluo - 4 Direct Kit ( Life Technologies ) ( 11 ) as recommended by the manufacturer . Mitochondria in live cells were labeled with MitoTracker Green ( Life Technologies ) ( 12 ) at a concentration of 50 nM for 10 min at 37°C . The cells were washed once with warm PBS and new warm culture medium was added immediately before imaging . Nuclei were visualized by incubating live cells in medium with 1 µ g / mL Hoechst 3342 ( Life Technologies ) for 5 min at 37°C and fresh medium was added . Ribeiro et al . : Supporting Information / 5 To visualize nascent t - tubule formation , we used di - 8 - ANEPPS ( Life Technologies ) , a lipophylic voltage - sensitive dye that localizes to t - tubules in mature hPSC - CMs ( 13 ) . We prepared 100 µ M di - 8 - ANEPPS in 20 % ( w / v ) Pluronic - F127 ( Sigma ) in DMSO from a stock solution of 2 mM di - 8 - ANEPPS in DMSO and added enough cell - culture medium to incubate cells in 10 µ M di - 8 - ANEPPS for 15 min at 37°C ( 13 ) . The medium was changed and cells were imaged 30 min later . This protocol was also used to label primary CMs from mice as a positive control for t - tubule labeling . Primary ventricular CMs were obtained as described ( 14 ) from 3 - month - old C57Bl6 mice ( 15 ) . The mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation . All animal care and experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California , San Francisco . Hearts were rapidly removed and perfused through the aorta , first with isolation solution ( 134 mM NaCl ; 11 mM glucose ; 4 mM KCl ; 1 . 2 mM MgSO 4 ; 1 . 2 mM NaH 2 PO 4 ; 10mM HEPES ) , pH 7 . 34 , for 4 minutes ; then with a solution containing collagenase type II ( 0 . 6 mg / mL ; Worthington ) and proteases type XIV ( 0 . 075 mg / mL ; Sigma ) for 9 minutes ; and finally with Tyrode solution containing 50 mM taurine , pH 7 . 34 , at room temperature for 12 minutes . The ventricles were removed , placed in Tyrode - taurine solution , cut in half and pipetted up and down through a Pasteur pipette in 5 ml of Tyrode - taurine solution to release CMs . For labeling , cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) in PBS for 15 min at 37°C , washed three times in PBS with 1 % bovine serum albumin , incubated in 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ( Fisher Scientific ) in PBS for 20 min and washed three times with PBS ( room temperature ) with 1 % bovine serum albumin . The cells were labeled with antibodies against α - actinin ( A7811 , Sigma ; 1 : 200 ) and troponin - I ( sc - 15368 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ; 1 : 200 ) at room temperature . To avoid nonspecific binding , cells were blocked in goat serum ( Life Technologies ) at room temperature for 1 h before antibodies were added . To image cells and devices , we used an inverted microscope equipped with a CCD camera : either a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M with a Zeiss Axiocam MRm camera or a Leica Microsystems DMI6000B with a Hamamatsu ORCA - R2 camera . Both microscopes had environmental chambers ( PeCon ) to maintain the temperature at 37°C and the CO 2 level at 5 % , fluorescence capabilities and automated stages to save positions for time - lapse studies . A confocal microscope ( Leica TCS SP5 ) was used to image t - tubules labeled with di - 8 - ANEPPS ( 13 ) . During video acquisition , cells were electrically paced at 1 Hz with 10 - ms - wide biphasic pulses at 10 – 15 V electric - field stimulation ( Myopacer , IonOptix ) . Mechanical Output of Contractile Single hPSC - CMs Traction stresses generated during the contraction of single hPSC - CMs were estimated by traction force microscopy ( 7 ) . Cells were maintained in culture on deformable hydrogels with dispersed fluorescent microbeads ( described above ) and videos of moving microbeads were acquired for 10 s at a minimum speed of 26 frames / s with a 40X objective . To estimate forces from substrate displacements ( 16 ) , images of moving microbeads were processed with ImageJ 1 . 48 ( National Institutes of Health ) plugins . In brief , displacements were measured by particle image velocimetry ( PIV ) ( 16 ) from an image of microbeads within the substrate under a relaxed cell and another image of microbeads under that cell at its maximal contraction . Fields of stress Ribeiro et al . : Supporting Information / 6 vectors ( P i , j ) , where i ( x ) and j ( y ) are the vector coordinates with magnitude | P i , j | were reconstructed from PIV displacements by a Fourier transform traction cytometry method ( 16 ) and regularization scheme on the grid obtained from PIV . The regularization parameter was set at 9 × 10 - 9 for traction - force reconstructions . The absolute values of all the estimated stress vectors | P i , j | in the area displaced ( A d ) by the beating hPSC - CM were averaged < | P i , j | > Ad and multiplied by A d to estimate the sum of generated forces Σ | F c | during cell contractions . Σ F ! = | P ! , ! | ! ! . A ! [ 1 ] All micropatterns used in measurements of mechanical output had an area of 2000 µ m 2 ( Figs . 1 , S1 and S2 ) . Beating hPSC - CMs on rectangular micropatterns generate a dipole of contractile forces ( F c ) with a zero vector sum ( Fig . 1 ) . Thus we compare contractile outputs as the absolute value of the sum of force magnitudes . With this method of estimating force , Σ | F c | is equivalent to the sum of the absolute values of the force dipole for rectangular cells . The contractile activity of square cells and unpatterned cells does not generate a force dipole . Maximal work was estimated by multiplying Σ | F c | and the sum of the absolute displacement values from PIV . The duration of contraction was calculated as the time difference between images taken at full contraction and at full relaxation . Contraction velocity was calculated by dividing the sum of absolute displacements by the duration of contraction . The power output of single cells was calculated by multiplying Σ | F c | by the velocity of displacements . Dimensions in acquired images were converted from pixels to µ m with Zeiss software ( ZEN 2011 blue edition ) and verified with calibration slides ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) . We calculated cell shortening velocity by subtracting the cell length in full contraction from the cell length in full relaxation and dividing the result by the time that takes the cell to fully contract . To calculate maximal velocity of contraction ( V C ) and maximal velocity of relaxation ( V R ) of substrate microbeads displaced by each cell , we analyzed adjacent frames of videos of microbeads that moved during contractile events of beating hPSC - CMs . For each pair of frames of videos of moving microbeads , we determined the average displacement of microbeads with the MATLAB ( Mathworks ) - based digital image correlation software package Ncorr ( 17 ) . We calculate the velocity of displacement of microbeads between adjacent frames in the video by multiplying the average displacement of each pair of frames by the camera acquisition speed in frames per second . For each contractile event , we selected the maximal value of average displacement of microbeads during cell contraction ( V C ) and relaxation ( V R ) . For these specific measurements , videos of moving microbeads were acquired at speeds at or above 30 frames per second depending on the dimensions of the field of view . To increase the extracellular concentration of calcium , we added CaCl 2 ( Fisher Scientific ) to the cell culture medium up to a concentration of 1 mM and incubated cells overnight . According to vendor instructions ( Life Technologies ) , the concentration of the cell culture medium is 0 . 4 mM . Quantification of Sarcomere and Myofibril Organization Sarcomere length , myofibril alignment and direction of sarcomere movement during contraction Ribeiro et al . : Supporting Information / 7 were determined from images or videos of myofibrils fluorescently labeled with LifeAct ( 10 ) . Specifically , videos of LifeAct - labeled myofibrils were acquired at speeds above 5 frames per second with a 40X objective at exposures between 100 - 200 ms . As needed , images were rotated to define the major axis of the cell as the x - axis and the minor cell axis as the y - axis . Sarcomere length was calculated by using ImageJ to draw a line in video - frame sequences along several myofibrils in contractile cells . We plotted the profile of fluorescence intensity and measured the distance between adjacent troughs of minimum intensity along the line . These distances correspond to the regions between Z - lines ( Fig . S3 ) ( 18 , 19 ) . Since distances were calculated from videos , we determined sarcomere distances in both relaxed and contracted cells . Sarcomere shortening length was defined as the difference between mean sarcomere length during relaxation and contraction . To quantify myofibril alignment , we used ImageJ to perform fast Fourier transforms ( 20 ) of fluorescent images of cells with LifeAct - labeled myofibrils ; for subsequent processing , we contrasted the resulting Fourier spectrum to exclude low frequencies . We split the resulting Fourier spectrum image into sections radially distributed around the center of the image and calculated the spectrum intensity for each radial section ( 20° angle ) ( Fig . 4A ) . The myofibril alignment index was calculated by dividing the intensity of the spectrum section at 80° by the intensity of the spectrum section at 0° . Alignment index values scale with the level of myofibril alignment within each cell ( Fig . 4A ) . To quantify the direction of contracting myofibrils , we analyzed videos of contracting cells with LifeAct labeled myofibrils ( Fig S8 ) with a set of MATLAB ( Mathworks ) - based algorithms in a particle traction velocimetry graphical user interface ( 21 ) . We adjusted the threshold of fluorescence intensity in video frames above which sarcomeres were identified as particles and analyzed videos of moving myofibrils by particle traction velocimetry ( Fig S8 ) . Sarcomere locations were mapped in Cartesian coordinates—u ( x ) and v ( y ) —and u / v was calculated to qualify myofibril movement along the x - axis relative to the y - axis . Inhibition of Cytoskeleton Polymerization and Intracellular Tension To induce defects in the organization , alignment and shape of myofibrils , hPSC - CMs expressing LifeAct were incubated in a solution of EDTA ( Life Technologies ) dissolved in PBS at a concentration of 1 mM . To assess the development of defects , cells were incubated for various times . To test the recovery of myofibril alignment , we washed the cells to remove EDTA and incubated them in fresh medium for 4 h . To evaluate the roles of intracellular tension in the recovery of myofibril alignment from EDTA - induced defects , we incubated hPSC - CMs with one of several cytoskeleton and tension inhibitors for 4 h . We added nocodazole ( Sigma - Aldrich ; 5 μ M ) to inhibit polymerization of microtubules ( 22 ) ; cytochalasin - D ( Sigma - Aldrich ; 1 μ M ) to inhibit actin polymerization ( 23 ) ; blebbistatin ( Sigma - Aldrich ; 1 μ M ) to inhibit actin – myosin II interactions ( 24 , 25 ) ; 1 - ( 5 - iodonaphthalene - 1 - sulphonyl ) - 1Hhexahydro - 1 , 4 - diazepine hydrochloride ( ML - 7 ; Sigma ; an inhibitor of myosin light - chain kinase ; 2 μ M ) to inhibit nonmuscle myosin activity ( 26 ) ; and 2 , 3 - butanedione monoxime ( BDM ; Sigma - Aldrich ; 1 mM ) to inhibit myosin - actin interactions by reducing ATPase activity ( 27 ) . Drugs were added directly to fresh RPMI - 1640 culture medium . After 4 h of incubation , we tested the effect of blebbistatin , ML - 7 and BDM on the length of Ribeiro et al . : Supporting Information / 8 7 : 1 hPSC - CMs that were not treated with EDTA . To study the effect on the percent change in length , we subtracted the length of each cell after 4 h of incubation from the initial cell length and divided by the initial cell length . Electrophysiological Measurements of Single Cells To assess cell electrophysiology as a measure of cell maturity and to determine cell type ( atrial vs . ventricular ) ( 28 ) , we used the whole - cell patch - clamp technique , an Axopatch 200B amplifier ( Molecular Devices ) , pClamp 9 . 2 software ( Axon Instruments ) and thin - walled borosilicate glass patch pipettes ( resistance , 4 – 6 M Ω ) . Voltage - and current - clamp recordings were made at 35°C . For recording of action potentials , cells were stimulated at 0 . 5 nA for 5 ms to elicit a response . Standard electrophysiological protocols were used for voltage - clamp recordings ( 28 ) . Gene expression analysis with qRT - PCR We harvested hPSC - CMs from patterns for gene expression analysis with qRT - PCR . For populations of several cells , total RNA was Trizol extracted , column - purified and reverse transcribed with a high - capacity reverse transcription kit ( Applied Biosystems ) . All qPCR analyses were performed using the Fast Taqman Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems ) . Gene expressions levels were normalized to GAPDH and are shown relative to unpatterned cardiomyocytes unless otherwise stated . We analyzed the expression of the titin gene ( TTN ) isoforms NA2 and N2B and the expression of TTNI3 ( troponin - I type 3 ( cardiac ) ) and TNNT2 ( troponin - T type 2 ( cardiac ) ) . Single hPSC - CMs were aspirated from each pattern and analyzed with the CellsDirect One - Step qRT - PCR Kit ( Life Technologies ) . Cells were lysed at 50 ° C for 30 min and subjected to 21 cycles of target - specific pre - amplification ( 29 ) . Expression of the following genes was determined : BIN1 ( Myc box - dependent - interacting protein 1 ) , KCNH2 ( potassium voltage - gated channel , subfamily H ( eag - related ) , member 2 ) , KCNE1 ( potassium voltage - gated channel , Isk - related family , member 1 ) , GATA4 ( GATA binding protein 4 ) , CACNA1C ( calcium channel , voltage - dependent , L type , alpha 1C subunit ) , ACTN2 ( actinin , alpha 2 ) , NKX2 . 5 ( NK2 homeobox 5 ) , TNNI3 ( troponin - I type 3 ( cardiac ) ) , MYH7 ( myosin , heavy chain 7 , cardiac muscle , beta ) , MYL7 ( myosin , light chain 7 , regulatory ) , MYL2 ( myosin , light chain 2 , regulatory , cardiac ) , GAPDH ( glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ) , NPPA ( natriuretic peptide A ) , ACTB ( actin , beta ) , MYH6 ( myosin , heavy chain 6 , cardiac muscle , alpha ) , SCN5A ( sodium channel , voltage - gated , type V , alpha subunit ) , NEUROD1 ( neuronal differentiation 1 ) and COL1A1 ( collagen , type I , alpha 1 ) . qRT - PCR was performed on an ABI 7900HT ( Applied Biosystems ) with TaqMan probes for each gene . All negative values were assigned a log2 expression of 0 . The higher the value of log2exp , the higher the expression of that transcript . Log2exp data were hierarchically clustered in Cluster 3 . 0 and plotted with Treeview . Mechanical Stimulation hPSC - CMs on 7 : 1 patterns were mechanical stimulated by stretching their substrate ( 30 , 31 ) with a glass probe ( tip diameter 30 – 50 µm ) created from 2 - mm glass rods with a pipette puller ( World Precision Instruments ) . The probe was mounted on a micromanipulator ( Narishige MHW - 3 ) , positioned at the hydrogel surface , landed 50 – 100 µm from the end of an engineered Ribeiro et al . : Supporting Information / 9 hPSC - CM and moved with the micromanipulator to stretch the hydrogel substrate . Cell elongation and any effects associated with stretching were monitored with an inverted microscope . We acquired videos of moving cells and the substrate for further analysis . We stopped acquiring videos after cells stopped beating . Statistical Analysis The Wilcoxon - Mann - Whitney rank - order test ( 32 ) was used to evaluate statistical differences between populations without the requirement for normal distribution . For two populations with samples of size n 1 and n 2 , the observations were ranked regardless of the population to which they belong and the ranks for each population were added . The smallest observation n i , where 0 < i < n , had rank 1 ; the largest observation n j , where j = I and 0 < j < n , had rank n 1 + n 2 . All the ranks for each sample were summed and the test statistic value U was computed . A two - sided p - value for the Wilcoxon - Mann - Whitney test was calculated for a cumulative normal density function . We performed one - way ANOVA ( analysis of variance ) tests with Bonferroni’s all pairs comparison post hoc test assuming a 95 % confidence level . This analysis involves adjustments made to p - values when several dependent or independent statistical tests are done simultaneously on a single data set ( 33 ) . References 1 .
