For instance , image acquisition speed can only be increased in exchange for a lowered signal quality , or for an increased rate of photo - damage to the specimen . Computational denoising can recover some loss of signal , extending the trade - off margin for high - speed imaging . Recently proposed denoising on the basis of neural networks shows exceptional performance but raises concerns of errors typical of neural networks . Here , we present a work - flow that supports an empirically optimized reduction of exposure times , as well as per - image quality control to exclude images with reconstruction errors . We implement this work - flow on the basis of the denoising tool Noise2Void and assess the molecular state and three - dimensional shape of RNA Polymerase II ( Pol II ) clusters in live zebrafish embryos . Image acquisition speed could be tripled , achieving 2 - second time resolution and 350 - nanometer lateral image resolution . The obtained data reveal stereotyped events of approximately 10 seconds duration : initially , the molecular mark for initiated Pol II increases , then the mark for active Pol II increases , and finally Pol II clusters take on a stretched and unfolded shape . An independent analysis based on fixed sample images reproduces this sequence of events , and suggests that they are related to the transient association of genes with Pol II clusters . Our work - flow consists of procedures that can be implemented on commercial fluorescence microscopes without any hardware or software modification , and should therefore be transferable to many other applications .

A specific area of application is the visualization of 4 fluorescently labeled molecules . The design of such experiments is subject to inherent 5 limitations [ 2 , 3 ] , requiring a trade - off between acquisition speed , signal - to - noise ratio 6 ( SNR ) , and prevention of photo - damage to the specimen [ 4 ] . These parameters cannot 7 be optimized separately . For instance , to increase acquisition speed , exposure time 8 must be reduced , leading to lower SNR [ 5 , 6 ] . SNR can be recovered by , for example , 9 increased power of the light used to excite fluorescence in the sample , resulting however 10 in increased photo - damage . 11 While the experimental parameters during acquisition are subject to firm trade - off 12 relationships , computational processing of images after acquisition can recover image 13 quality . These approaches allow , for example , a further reduction of exposure times 14 followed by computational reconstruction of low - SNR images . Conventional approaches 15 for reconstruction of low - SNR images include projection methods [ 7 ] , deconvolution filters 16 [ 8 , 9 ] , and denoising methods [ 10 , 11 ] . In the past decade , deep learning methods have 17 become widely used in a variety of image processing applications , often outperforming 18 conventional approaches [ 12 ] . In biological microscopy , deep learning has been successfully 19 used for image classification [ 13 – 15 ] , segmentation [ 16 , 17 ] , and restoration [ 18 – 21 ] . Initial 20 deep learning approaches used standard deep networks to restore fluorescence microscopy 21 images , requiring training data sets of matched low - quality and high - quality images . 22 For example , networks can be trained on a reference data set with high SNR ( “ground 23 truth” ) , so as to restore matched images with low SNR ( “noisy data” ) [ 22 ] . One obstacle 24 to the wide - spread application of such reconstruction approaches is the requirement for 25 matched high - quality training data [ 23 , 24 ] . These data are laborious or sometimes even 26 impossible to obtain in a fashion that is sufficiently matched to noisy data . An alternative 27 is provided by Noise2Noise ( n2n ) techniques , which enable the training of deep networks 28 from matched pairs of noisy images [ 25 , 26 ] . The requirement for any matched images is 29 fully removed in the Noise2Void ( n2v ) technique , where learning and removal of noise 30 are carried out based on a single noisy image data set [ 26 , 27 ] . Reconstruction based on 31 a single noisy data set also allows per - image training , thus compensating for day - to - day 32 variability of , for example , fluorescence labeling or fine - adjustment of optical parts . 33 A second obstacle to the wide application of deep learning methods is the possibility 34 of errors in the reconstructed fluorescence images [ 23 , 24 ] . These errors manifest as 35 deviations between the high - quality ground truth images and the images reconstructed 36 from low SNR data . A dilemma arises , where the effective application of deep learning 37 networks can only proceed without acquisition of ground truth data , but ground truth 38 data are required to assure the experimenter that reconstruction is error - free . In this 39 work , we develop a pragmatic work - flow for the quality - controlled adjustment and 40 application of n2v for denoising in high - speed fluorescence microscopy . In this work - flow , 41 for every acquired view of a given sample , a small data set with high - quality data is 42 recorded to control reconstruction quality , followed by full time - lapse acquisition of only 43 compromised data . We demonstrate the applicability of this work flow in the analysis 44 of fluctuations in molecular clusters in live zebrafish embryos . Our analysis reveals 45 a close coordination between post - translational modifications of RNA polymerase II 46 ( Pol II ) and changes in the three - dimensional ( 3D ) shape of these clusters on the scale 47 of a few seconds . These observations are confirmed by an alternative experimental 48 approach , where still images from chemically fixed cells are sorted based on an additional 49 fluorescence marker for genes that transiently engage with the molecular clusters . Our 50 approach provides a guideline for other microscopists interested in the quality - controlled 51 application of ground - truth - free image reconstruction methods . The approach can be 52 implemented on any fluorescence microscope typically used for time - lapse recordings 53 without the need of software development or hardware control beyond the standard 54 functionality . 55 2 Results 56 Quantification of image reliability and effective resolution in re - 57 constructed microscopy images 58 The structural reliability and effective spatial resolution of reconstructed images can 59 be assessed by a combination of widely used metrics . The structural reliability can be 60 assessed via the structural similarity index metric ( SSIM ) . SSIM quantifies the similarity 61 between two images and returns a value between 0 and 1 [ 28 , 29 ] . SSIM values close to 62 1 indicate that two images are very similar , lower SSIM values indicate images that are 63 less similar . One application is the comparison of two images obtained with the same 64 acquisition and post - processing steps , providing a quantification of the reliability of the 65 obtained images . Using SSIM , we can , for example , demonstrate how changes in image 66 acquisition settings , such as the reduction of exposure time , can compromise image 67 reliability ( Fig . S1 ) . Applying n2v to pairs of reconstructed super - resolution microscopy 68 images , we can illustrate how denoising can increase image reliability ( Fig . 1A , B ) . SSIM 69 can also be used to assess whether reconstructions of low - quality images obtained with , 70 for example , low exposure times can approximate high - quality images ( Fig . 1A , B ) . The 71 assessment of image reliability via SSIM is , however , not sensitive to localized differences 72 between images , as are typically introduced at edges during denoising procedures . Such 73 local occurrences of unreliable reconstruction are readily detected by the local SSIM ( Fig . 74 S3 ) [ 30 ] . The combination of SSIM and local SSIM thus allows an assessment of image 75 reliability based on paired images , as well as the similarity between a reconstructed and 76 a corresponding high - quality image . 77 A key aspect of performance in microscopy is the effective image resolution . The 78 effective image resolution is determined by both the optical resolution of a given imaging 79 instrument , and by the ratio of photons emitted by the structure of interest over polluting 80 photons , often referred to as SNR . This effective resolution can be quantified via Fourier 81 ring correlation ( FRC ) [ 31 , 32 ] . FRC evaluates the similarity of a pair of images in 82 frequency space , so as to determine the spatial frequency up to which the images are 83 consistent with each other ( Fig . 1C ) . The inverse of this spatial frequency is then taken as 84 the effective spatial resolution ( Fig . 1D ) . Applying the FRC metric to our super - resolution 85 microscopy data reveals that , indeed , n2v - denoising can recover effective resolution in 86 low - quality images ( Fig . 1D , Fig . S2 ) . Taken together , SSIM and FRC can objectively 87 assess image reliability and effective resolution in matched pairs of reconstructed images . 88 Optimization of exposure time for high - speed time - lapse imaging 89 While denoising with n2v can , in principle , reconstruct images acquired with reduced 90 exposure time ( t exp ) , for a given experiment it is not known a priori just how far t exp 91 can be reduced while ensuring a sufficient image reconstruction . To demonstrate how 92 SSIM and FRC can guide the choice of t exp , we carried out live sample microscopy of 93 cells obtained from buccal smears ( “human cheek cells” ) for a range of exposure times , 94 t exp = 20 , 40 , 70 , 100 , 150 ms ( Fig . 2A ) . For each t exp , a n2v - network was separately 95 trained on a pair of images and the effective resolution for these reconstructed images 96 was assessed ( Fig . 2B ) . For t exp = 70 ms , of 70 ms or higher , an effective resolution 97 of ∼ 200 nm was attained for the reconstructed images ( Fig . 2C ) . This resolution was 98 not further improved by longer exposure times , but could not attained for shorter 99 exposure times ( Fig . 2C ) . This FRC - based assessment suggest t exp = 70 ms as an 100 optimal exposure time . We controlled the structural reliability of the reconstructed 101 images by local SSIM , finding reconstruction errors for t exp = 20 ms ( Fig . S3A - G ) . 102 Considering both the FRC and local SSIM results , all t exp ≥ 40 ms seem structurally 103 reliable , while only t exp ≥ 70 ms allows maximal effective image resolution after image 104 3 Fig 1 . Metrics for the reliability and effective resolution in Noise2Void - reconstructed images . A ) Representative micrographs of the DNA distribution in a nucleus in a fixed zebrafish embryo , recorded with a stimulated emission depletion ( STED ) super - resolution microscope . The same image plane was recorded twice at low quality , once at high quality , and two Noise2Void - reconstructed images were prepared from the low - quality images . B ) SSIM values for pair - wise comparison ( image 1 vs . image 2 ) and comparison against the high - quality image ( image 1 vs . high - quality and image 2 vs . high - quality ) for the low - quality images and the reconstructed images . C ) FRC curves calculated based on a low - quality image pair and the corresponding reconstructed image pair . D ) FRC - based effective resolution for four pairs of low - quality images and the corresponding pairs of reconstructed images . reconstruction . In this setting , the experimenter can therefore choose between faster 105 acquisition ( t exp = 40 ms ) or higher effective resolution ( t exp = 70 ms ) , all while ensuring 106 a high certainty of structural reliability . 107 A two - phase acquisition protocol for quality - controlled denoising 108 of time - lapse recordings 109 To integrate the metric - based assessment of n2v - processed images with the recording 110 of high - speed time - lapse data , we propose an acquisition protocol that contains two 111 distinct phases and is carried out at every position in a given sample ( Fig . 3A ) . In the 112 first phase ( A , assessment ) , all image data required for the application of SSIM and FRC 113 metrics are recorded ( Fig . 3B ) . In particular , for each of the image planes that make 114 up the acquired 3D volume , the following images are obtained : one low - quality image 115 ( t exp ) , two high - quality images recorded with a longer reference exposure time ( t ref ) , 116 followed by two more low - quality test images ( t exp ) . In the second phase ( B , time - lapse ) , 117 a sequence of 3D volumes is acquired with only a single low - quality images for each of 118 the image planes , reducing the time spent for the acquisition of a 3D volume ( Fig . 3B ) . 119 The data acquired by this two - phase acquisition protocol allow a comprehensive 120 quality control assessment for every recorded position . Specifically , we first train a n2v 121 network for each position , with which we reconstruct the low - quality test images 1 and 122 2 . We can then assess the effective resolution using the FRC metric and additionally 123 control the reconstructed image for reconstruction errors using SSIM and local SSIM . 124 For positions where a sufficient effective resolution is achieved by the reconstruction , 125 and a sufficiently low level of reconstruction error is found , the trained n2v - network 126 is then applied to the time - lapse data from phase B , thus providing n2v - reconstructed 127 time - lapses with per - position quality - control . 128 4 Fig 2 .

B ) FRC curves calculated from a pair of matched low - quality images , from a pair of reconstructed images , and a pair of high - quality images for the different t exp . C ) Effective resolution for the indicated t exp , n = 5 nuclei per t exp , values are shown with mean . High - speed imaging reveals coordinated changes of phosphoryla - 129 tion and morphology of RNA polymerase II clusters 130 To demonstrate the applicability of our proposed protocol for quality - controlled n2v - 131 supported live imaging protocol , we attempted to visualize changes in the molecular 132 state as well as the 3D shape of macro - molecular clusters enriched in Pol II . To this 133 end , we recorded microscopy images from live zebrafish embryos with an instant - SIM 134 microscope [ 33 ] . We visualized Pol II that is recruited to macromolecular clusters ( Pol 135 II Ser5P ) or has transitioned towards production of RNA transcripts ( Pol II Ser2P ) by 136 fluorescently labeled antibody fragments ( Fabs ) . These Fabs provide good sensitivity in 137 zebrafish embryos and do not perturb embryonic development in any obvious fashion 138 [ 34 – 36 ] . To establish exposure times , we first adjusted imaging parameters so as to obtain 139 images that reveal cluster shape in the Pol II Ser5P channel on the microscope’s live 140 display without any processing . We chose this reference exposure time as t ref = 200 ms , 141 resulting in an overall time of 6 s that is required to obtain a full 3D image stack . Using 142 t ref = 200 ms , we recorded image data in line with the two - phase acquisition protocol , 143 with the phase B spanning a total time of 2 min . Specifically , we recorded data for four 144 different exposure times ( t exp = 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 ms , Fig . S4A - C ) . For all t exp , we achieve 145 an effective resolution of 400 nm ( lateral ) or better after n2v - based reconstruction , 146 which compares favorably to an effective resolution of approximately 700 nm in the 147 high - quality images ( Fig . S4D ) . Analysis by local SSIM suggests that reconstructions 148 5 Fig 3 . A two - phase acquisition protocol to combine acquisition of quality control images with high - speed time - lapse imaging . A ) Image data were acquired at multiple positions in a sample , thus obtaining multiple viewpoints containing several objects of interest ( nuclei , indicated in green ) . B ) For each position , a sequence of two acquisition phases is carried out . In phase A , for each z position , a low - quality image , two high - quality reference images , and two low - quality test images are recorded . Low - quality images are recorded at a shortened exposure time ( t exp ) , high - quality images at a reference exposure time resulting in images of the desired quality ( t ref ) . Acquisition phase A obtains the images required for Noise2Void model training as well as the assessment of effective image resolution and reconstruction errors . In phase B , only single low - quality images are recorded with the shortened exposure time ( t exp ) , resulting in an increased rate of acquisition compared to acquisition with full exposure time ( t ref ) . Acquisition phase B obtains only low - quality images , which are reconstructed after the experiment is completed . for t exp ≥ 20 ms offer a reliability similar to a comparison between two high - quality 149 images , reconstructions of images obtained with t exp = 10 ms are prone to reconstruction 150 errors ( Fig . S4E ) . Accordingly , we selected images acquired with t exp = 20 ms ( effective 151 lateral resolution ∼ 400 nm ) and t exp = 50 ms ( effective lateral resolution ∼ 350 nm ) for 152 further analysis , which provided full 3D image stacks at a time resolution of 1 s and 2 s , 153 respectively . 154 As previously observed , clusters seen in the Pol II Ser5P channel were persistent 155 during the entire phase B acquisition period [ 36 ] . The n2v - processed Pol II Ser5P 156 time - lapse images were thus segmented to detect Pol II - enriched clusters , each cluster 157 was then tracked over the whole time - lapse based on spatial proximity in consecutive 158 time points ( Fig . 4B ) . Based on the Pol II Ser5P - derived segmentation masks , Pol 159 II Ser5P and Ser2P intensities as well as shape quantifiers ( elongation and solidity ) 160 could be determined for each time point ( Fig . 4A ) . The resulting time courses exhibit 161 fluctuations , and the question arises whether a systematic relationship exists between 162 the different quantities ( Fig . 4C ) . Indeed , cross - correlation analysis that was anchored 163 on cluster elongation reveals a systematic relationship ( Fig . 4D ) . The cross - correlation 164 analysis reveals an initial increase in Pol II Ser5P intensity , followed by a transient 165 increase in Pol II Ser2P intensity ∼ 5 s later , and a transient decrease in Pol II Ser5P 166 intensity another ∼ 5 s later . These changes are accompanied by an initial rounding up 167 of clusters ( solidity increase ) , followed by transient unfolding ( solidity decrease ) ∼ 10 s 168 later . These cross - correlation analysis results are obtained at both t exp = 50 ms ( Fig . 169 4 ) and t exp = 20 ms ( Fig . S5 ) , indicating that our findings are not mere coincidence . 170 Our observations are representative of a stereotypical sequence of events , which occurs 171 repeatedly and is therefore detected by the cross - correlation analysis : Pol II Ser5P 172 intensity increases and the cluster rounds up due to the rapid recruitment of Pol II to 173 a given cluster , Pol II Ser5P intensity decreases and Pol II Ser2P intensity increases 174 as some of the recruited Pol II proceeds into transcript production , while the cluster 175 gets elongated and unfolded due to a shape perturbation resulting from transcript 176 production . Previous work indicates that transcribing Pol II and the resulting nascent 177 6 RNA transcripts induce distinct rearrangements in molecular clusters , explaining a 178 potential source for the shape perturbation [ 35 – 38 ] . Notably , these works suggest that 179 changes in Pol II state and cluster organization come about due to transient engagement 180 of genes with Pol II - enriched clusters , leading to the induction of genes and to their 181 release from these clusters . 182 Fig 4 .

D ) Cross - correlation analysis of the temporal coordination of Pol II Ser5P intensity , Pol II Ser2P intensity , and solidity with elongation . Gray lines indicate the time - shifted correlation for single cluster time courses , thick lines indicate the mean , and the gray region the 95 % bootstrap confidence interval . Analysis based on n = 30 tracked clusters , recorded from one sphere stage embryo . E ) Summary of the coordinated changes in phosphorylation and cluster shape suggested by the cross - correlation analysis . A stereotypical sequence of events can be seen : cluster Pol II Ser5P intensity transiently increases ( red ) and the cluster becomes rounder , then cluster Pol II Ser2P transiently intensity increases ( blue ) , until finally the cluster transiently unfolds and becomes elongated . Pseudo - time analysis from fixed sample images also detects coor - 183 dinated changes in phosphorylation and cluster shape . 184 To verify the conclusions obtained by the fluctuation analysis , we assessed changes 185 in cluster state by an independent approach based on the interaction with a gene . 186 Specifically , we fixed zebrafish embryos in the sphere stage , and fluorescently labeled 187 a panel of 8 genes as well as Pol II Ser5P and Pol II Ser2P ( Fig . 5A ) . Fixation of 188 samples prevents live imaging , thus removing the temporal information from the images . 189 In exchange , images with distinctly higher signal can be obtained without the need of 190 n2v - processing , and the location of the labeled gene can be used as additional information 191 that is not available in our live imaging data . The analysis of the obtained image data 192 was therefore based on gene - Pol II cluster interaction pairs . An interaction pair is 193 constructed by the detection of the location of a labeled gene , and by logical association 194 of this gene with the Pol II Ser5P cluster that is closest in space ( Fig . S6A , B ) . For each 195 interaction pair , fluorescence intensities of the gene , fluorescence intensities of the the Pol 196 7 Fig 5 . Pseudo - time analysis of data from fixed embryos relates transient engagement and activation of a gene to the phosphorylation and shape changes observed in live embryos . A ) Example images of Pol II Ser5P ( magenta signal ) clusters sorted by a pseudo - time progress coordinate ( s , periodic , defined on the interval [ 0 , 1 ) ) , which is calculated based on interaction with the gene klf2b ( green represents oligopaint fluorescence in situ hybridization signal for klf2b ) . Center positions ( weighted centroid ) are indicated for the Pol II Ser5P cluster ( white circle with black filling ) and the gene ( black circle with white filling ) and connected with a white line for illustration . For details of the reconstruction , see Fig . S6 . For an overview containing all eight genes that were assessed , see Fig . S7 . B ) Pol II Ser5P and Ser2P intensity , elongation , and solidity of Pol II Ser5P clusters sorted by pseudo - time s . A total of n = 186 clusters from N = 4 independent samples , obtained in two independent experiments , were included in the analysis . C ) Cross - correlation analyses for different register shifts in the coordinate s , the register shift is in units of data points by which the coordinate s was shifted . Gray regions indicate 95 % bootstrap confidence interval . 8 II cluster , distance between both objects , and shape properties of the Pol II cluster were 197 combined into a vector representing the interaction pair . Principal component analysis 198 of these pairs revealed a cyclical pattern , based on which a pseudo - time coordinate was 199 constructed ( Fig . 5B and Fig . S6C ) . The assignment of a pseudo - temporal order to 200 image data obtained from fixed samples has been used previously , for example for the 201 nanoscale assessment of endocytosis [ 39 , 40 ] . Ordering the interaction pairs along the 202 pseudo - time coordinate allowed the extraction of time - shifted correlations ( Fig . 5C ) , 203 which directly mirrored those we obtained from on our live imaging data ( Fig . 4D ) . We 204 suspected that the location of a gene that interacts with Pol II Ser5P clusters provides 205 the crucial information for successful pseudo - time reconstruction ( Fig . S7 , genes foxd5 , 206 klf2b , zgc : 64022 ) . Indeed , when we attempted pseudo - time reconstruction on the full 207 panel consisting of eight genes , we found that for genes that only rarely come close 208 to Pol II Ser5P clusters , the pseudo - time approach failed to reproduce the correlation 209 analysis results ( Fig . S7 , genes vamp2 , ripply1 , drll . 2 , gadd45ga , iscub ) . In the case 210 of successful pseudo - time reconstruction , our results suggests that a gene visits a Pol 211 II Ser5P cluster in close coordination with changes that occur in the Pol II cluster . 212 Specifically , genes engage in close contact when cluster Pol II Ser5P intensity increases , 213 and detach at a time when clusters undergo transient elongation ( Fig . 5A , B and Fig . 214 S7 , genes foxd5 , klf2b , zgc : 64022 ) . The time - scales of this interaction can be estimated 215 by a comparison of the distance between the cross - correlation maximum and minimum 216 in the cluster Pol II Ser5P signal ( ∼ 50 steps in pseudo - time , corresponding to ∼ 10 s 217 in the cross - correlation analysis based on live - imaging results ) and the total number 218 of observed interaction pairs ( 169 , 186 , 191 for foxd5 , klf2b , zgc : 64022 , respectively ) , 219 implying in an average duration of ∼ 36 s between two consecutive interaction events . 220 To conclude , the correlation analysis based on pseudo - time reconstruction provides an 221 independent confirmation of the coordination between Pol II phosphorylation levels and 222 cluster shape obtained by n2v - supported live imaging . This agreement suggests that 223 these two approaches provide complementary views of the same , stereotyped sequence of 224 changes in molecular properties and the shape of Pol II clusters . 225 Discussion 226 In this study , we describe how the quality of images that are reconstructed by deep - 227 learning algorithms can be controlled for , addressing the specific case of unsupervised 228 denoising by Noise2Void . We implemented our approach of quality control towards the 229 acceleration of high - speed imaging , where camera exposure times are reduced and the 230 resulting loss of signal quality is recovered by n2v - denoising . We then apply our approach 231 to the example of imaging the molecular state and the shape of RNA polymerase II 232 clusters in live zebrafish embryos . Our work illustrates how , in a practical application 233 setting , the performance improvements from deep - learning algorithms in fluorescence 234 microscopy can be combined with a high level of confidence in the reconstructed images . 235 We specifically apply our quality - control approach to an unsupervised denoising 236 technique , the deep learning - based tool Noise2Void [ 27 ] . Currently , reconstructions that 237 map from noisy to high - quality data on the basis of paired training image data offer the 238 highest reconstruction performance [ 22 ] . In many practical settings , such pairs of noisy 239 and high - quality images cannot be obtained . An alternative is offered by reconstructions 240 based on matched pairs composed of noisy images only ( Noise2Noise [ 26 ] ) . Further 241 developments now offer the possibility to reconstruct high - quality images directly from 242 single noisy images ( Noise2Self [ 41 ] and Noise2Void [ 27 ] ) . A self - supervised approach 243 seems ideally suited to reconstruction tasks where fluorescence labeling exhibits strong 244 variability , optical components are changed between different experiments , or sample 245 properties vary on a day - to - day basis . These characteristics are typical of biological 246 9 microscopy applications , highlighting the applicability of self - supervised reconstruction 247 methods in this area . A crucial assumption of self - supervised denoising approaches is that 248 the noise in each pixel is an uncorrelated sample from the same probability distribution . 249 Newer variants of these algorithms explicitly adjust the probability distribution of 250 the noise to different parts of the image , thus improving the results where additional 251 information on the noise characteristics is available [ 19 , 42 , 43 ] . Yet other variants model 252 the structure of the signal itself [ 44 ] . These newer variants of self - supervised denoising 253 could provide further improvements in reconstruction performance , while retaining most 254 of the pragmatic applicability of self - supervised reconstruction methods . 255 We base our assessment of image quality on two metrics , ( local ) SSIM and FRC . 256 More generally , metrics for image quality assessment belong to three main groups of 257 functionality . The first group includes methods assessing the quality of images against 258 a corresponding reference image ( high - quality image ) . These methods are called full - 259 reference , emphasizing the need for high - quality reference data [ 28 , 45 ] . SSIM and 260 consecutive similarity ( CSS ) metric , which is a variation of SSIM [ 46 ] , are in this 261 category . We used ( local ) SSIM , which provides an error map by structurally comparing 262 the reconstructed image with the reference image , and based on that error map controlled 263 for reconstruction defects . The second group , called reduced - reference , contains methods 264 which are not using matched reference images , but rather general knowledge of properties 265 and statistics that are typical of a set of reference images [ 47 ] . Natural scene statistics 266 ( NSS ) is one major method in this category [ 45 ] . The underlying hypothesis of all 267 NSS - based method is that all the original images are “natural” and that a distortion 268 process introduces some unnaturalness that can be quantified by deviation from models of 269 natural signals . Due to the day - to - day variability of the signals produced by fluorescence 270 microscopy of biological samples , modeling natural signals appears challenging . The 271 third category of image quality assessment methods is called no - reference , because quality 272 assessment proceeds without a matched reference image or other prior knowledge [ 48 ] . 273 Fourier ring correlation ( FRC ) is in this category and we used it to assess the spatial 274 resolution of the reconstructed images . Based on the achieved spatial resolution , we 275 could decide how far exposure times could be reduced while still supporting successful 276 denoising . One tool that implements several of these metrics for the assessment of local 277 anomalies in super - resolution microscopy data is SQUIRREL [ 49 ] . The quality scores 278 and error mapping provided by SQUIRREL can , in principle , also be applied to images 279 reconstructed by deep - learning methods . 280 The image acquisition protocol we propose consists of a phase during which all 281 necessary data for quality control are collected for a single time point ( phase A ) , followed 282 by high - speed time - lapse imaging with compromised image quality ( phase B ) . This 283 protocol seems appropriate for the acquisition of short bursts of images , where the main 284 limitation lies in how many images can be acquired in a short amount of time . For other 285 imaging challenges , different protocols could be developed . In a different situation where , 286 for example , photo - bleaching limits the acquisition of long time courses , excitation light 287 levels could be reduced , and the compromised signal could be recovered by denoising . In 288 such an experiment , quality control points could be placed at regular intervals over the 289 course of acquisition . In a setting where , for example , sample structure or the level of 290 fluorescence labeling changes significantly over the course of recording , a quality control 291 phase at the beginning and at the end of the experiment might be advisable . Besides 292 the implementation of additional control points in the experimental procedure , such 293 extensions of our simple two - phase protocol would need no further modification to the 294 quality control approach we used in our work . 295 Our live - sample microscopy recordings reveal a stereotypical sequence of events , 296 where the Pol II recruitment and pause - release steps of transcriptional induction are 297 closely coordinated with changes in the shape of Pol II clusters . While previous studies 298 10 achieve high spatial or temporal resolution , our approach combines high resolution in 299 time as well as in space . Our temporal resolution of 1 - 2 seconds for a full 3D stack 300 is comparable to previous assessments of Pol II localization [ 50 , 51 ] . These studies , 301 however , do not monitor the specific phosphorylation states associated with Pol II 302 regulation . Imaging of these phosphorylation states was previously performed with an 303 effective time resolution of 1 min for a single gene [ 38 ] or 10 s for an engineered gene 304 array [ 52 ] for the acquisition of full 3D volumes . By fitting of kinetic models of Pol II 305 regulation , these studies suggest rates of promoter escape of 2 - 2 . 5 min and production 306 of the first 1 kb of transcript length within 2 . 5 min ( assuming an elongation rate of 307 0 . 4 kb per minute ) . Photobleaching experiments assessing endogenous Pol II combined 308 with computational modeling indicated 2 . 3 s for initiation and 42 s of pausing at the 309 promoter , as well as an elongation rate of 2 kb per minute [ 53 ] . Lastly , another study 310 suggests that 6 . 3 s are sufficient for Pol II to loosely associate with an induced gene as 311 well as proceed into elongation [ 50 ] . While these estimates for the duration of induction 312 and pause - release imply a broad spectrum of kinetics , our estimates of 2 - 3 s for promoter 313 escape and approximately 36 s for the duration of one complete gene - cluster interaction 314 cycle fall within the previously estimated range for promoter escape and RNA production . 315 Besides temporal coordination , also relative distances have been assessed , for example 316 between Pol II clusters and nascent mRNA [ 38 ] and between enhancers , Pol II , and 317 the transcription start site [ 54 , 55 ] . In these studies , nascent mRNA is displaced one 318 hundred to several hundred nm relative to sites harboring transcriptional regulators 319 and recruited Pol II . This displacement is in line with our observations that genes that 320 undergo elongation are located outside of Pol II Ser5P clusters . In contrast to previous 321 work , our approach reveals the full shape of the Pol II Ser5P clusters . Taken together , 322 the kinetics of single - gene induction suggested by our live - sample experiments seem in 323 line with previous work , and the spatial organization of clusters and interacting genes 324 directly correlates with previous work assessing relative distances of different components 325 of the transcriptional machinery . 326 Our pseudo - time reconstruction revealed that the changes in Pol II phosphorylation 327 and cluster shapes are temporally coordinated with the visit of genes to the Pol II clusters . 328 Previous work suggests that the Pol II clusters in early embryonic development form on 329 regulatory chromatin regions , including super - enhancers [ 36 , 56 , 57 ] . Accordingly , our 330 data seem to directly show single genes that undergo transcriptional activation during a 331 visit to Pol II - enriched cluster that contain regulatory chromatin regions . Different models 332 for such enhancer - promoter communication in transcriptional control were proposed [ 58 – 333 60 ] . The stereotypical sequence suggested by our data fits most closely to a condensate 334 hit - and - run model , where genes transiently interact with enhancer - associated condensates 335 for transcription initiation , and leave from the condensate in association with the onset 336 of transcriptional elongation [ 60 ] . A condensate hit - and - run model can also explain 337 earlier observations suggesting cyclic interactions , where genes repeatedly engage with 338 and depart from Pol II - enriched clusters [ 61 ] . Such a model also could support the 339 proximity - dependent activation of Shh by its enhancer ZRS [ 62 , 63 ] . The activation 340 of genes by enhancers was also found to not require direct contact , but can occur over 341 a distance of 200 nm or more [ 64 , 65 ] . These observations , together with evidence in 342 support of the condensate hit - and - run model , allow speculations about a liquid - bridge 343 model of enhancer - gene communication . In such a liquid - bridge model , genes transiently 344 become embedded within an enhancer - associated condensate , allowing the transfer of 345 transcriptional machinery , including Pol II , to the gene promoter [ 60 , 66 , 67 ] . While 346 previous work indicates that the onset of RNA production at newly activated genes 347 results in their exclusion from the enhancer - associated condensates [ 37 , 68 – 71 ] , the 348 initial engagement with the enhancer - associated condensates is less well understood . 349 Such an engagement would , however , be naturally explained by the formation of small 350 11 condensates at promoters . Such condensates could emerge , for example , at CpG - rich 351 regions that are placed directly upstream of promoter regions of many developmental 352 genes and were found to contribute to gene - promoter contacts in three - dimensional space 353 [ 72 ] . 354 Materials and Methods 355 Live imaging of primary cell culture of human cheek cell 356 Cells were obtained by a buccal smear with a P1000 pipette tip . Short - term primary 357 cell cultures were then created by adding the pipette tip to a micropipette and pipetting 358 up and down several times in 2 ml of PBS ( Dulbecco’s formulation ) with 0 . 8 mM CaCl 2 359 and 4 µ M Hoechst 33342 . 500 µ l of this primary cell culture were transferred to one 360 well of an 8 - well ibidi µ - Slide ( 8 - well glass bottom # 1 . 5 selected D263 M Schott glass ) . 361 The ibidi slide was sealed with parafilm to prevent evaporation and incubated for 1 h at 362 room temperature to ensure flattening of the cell nuclei before microscopy . Participants 363 provided free and informed consent . Procedures were reviewed and accepted by the 364 Karlsruhe Institute of Technology ethics committee . Raw image data were stored in an 365 anonymous fashion and are not for public release . 366 Zebrafish husbandry 367 All zebrafish husbandry was performed in accordance with the EU directive 2010 / 63 / EU 368 and German animal protection standards ( Tierschutzgesetz § 11 , Abs . 1 , No . 1 ) and 369 is under supervision of the government of Baden - W¨urttemberg , Regierungspr¨asidium 370 Karlsruhe , Germany ( Aktenzeichen35 - 9185 . 64 / BH KIT ) . Embryos used for the different 371 experiments were obtained through spontaneous mating of adult zebrafish . Collected 372 embryos were dechorionated with Pronase , washed 3 times with E3 embryo medium , 373 once with 0 . 3x Danieau’s solution , and subsequently kept in agarose - coated Petri dishes 374 or 6 - well plates in 0 . 3x Danieau’s solution at 28 . 5 o C . 375 STED microscopy of DNA in fixed zebrafish embryos 376 Following protocols from our previous work [ 73 ] , sphere - stage zebrafish embryos were 377 fixed overnight in 0 . 3X Danieu’s solution supplemented with 2 % formaldehyde and 378 0 . 2 % Tween - 20 at 4 ◦ C , permeabilized for 15 min using 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in PBS , 379 washed three times with PBS supplemented with 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 , and mounted in 380 TDE - media supplemented with 10x SPY - 595 DNA fluorescence stain under selected 381 # 1 . 5 glass cover slips . STED microscopy was performed using a Leica TCS SP8 STED 382 microscope ( Leica Microsystems , Wetzlar , Germany ) with a 775 nm depletion line and 383 a motorized - correction 93x NA 1 . 30 glycerol objective ( HC PL APO 93X / 1 . 30 GLYC 384 motCORR ) . 100 % 3D - STED depletion was used . 385 Live imaging of RNA Pol II CTD phosphorylation in zebrafish 386 embryos 387 One - cell - stage embryos were dechorionated with pronase in 0 . 3x Danieau’s solution and 388 covalently labeled fragments of antibodies ( Fab ) were micro - injected into the yolk . In 389 each embryo , 1 nl of Fab mix ( 0 . 2 µ l 1 % Phenol Red , 1 . 5 µ l A488 - labelled anti - Pol 390 II Ser2P Fab , 3 . 3 µ l JF646 - labelled anti - Pol II Ser5P Fab , Fab stock cencentration 391 approximately 1 mg / ml ) was injected . The embryos were mounted for microscopy in 392 0 . 7 % low - melting agarose in 0 . 3x Danieau’s solution in ibidi 35 mm imaging dishes ( # 1 . 5 393 12 selected glass cover slips ) at 512 - cell stage of development , images were acquired at the 394 sphere stage . 395 Oligopaint FISH and immunofluorescence in fixed whole embryos 396 Embryos were fixed in the sphere stage of development ( 4 % formaldehyde , 0 . 2 % Tween - 20 397 in 0 . 3x Danieau’s , fixation overnight at 4 ◦ C ) , permeabilized ( 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 in PBS , 398 15 min ) , washed in PBS with 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ( PBST ) for 2 minutes , and treated with 399 0 . 1 N HCl for 5 min . A sequence wash steps followed : twice with 1 ml 2x saline sodium 400 citrate buffer with 1 % Tween - 20 ( 2xSCCT ) , once with 2xSCCT + 50 % formamide for 2 401 min at room temperature , and once with preheated 2xSCCT + 50 % formamide at 60 o C 402 for 20 minutes . Liquid was replaced with a hybridiziation mix : 50 µ l formamide , 25 µ l 403 4x hybridization buffer ( 40 % dextran sulfate , 8xSSC , 0 . 8 % Tween - 20 ) , 2 µ l 20 µ g / µ l 404 RNase A , 10 µ M oligopaint probes labeled with Alexa 594 , and ddH 2 O added to reach 405 a total volume of 100 µ l . Denaturation at 90 o C for 3 min was followed by overnight 406 hybridiziation at 37 ◦ C . Hybridization was followed by the following wash steps : four 407 times with preheated 2xSSCT at 60 o C and twice with 2xSSCT at room temperature , 408 5 min incubation time for each step . Before proceeding with the immunofluorescence 409 protocol , the samples were additionally washed three times with 1 ml PBST for 5 minutes . 410 Samples were blocked with 4 % BSA in PBST , 30 minutes at room temperature , followed 411 by incubation of primary antibodies ( mouse anti - Pol II Ser5P ( 4H8 , 1 : 300 ) and rabbit 412 anti - Pol II Ser2P ( EPR18855 , 1 : 300 ) ) in 4 % BSA - PBST overnight at 4 ◦ C . Samples 413 were washed three times for 5 min with PBST , once with 4 % BSA - PBST , and again 414 incubated overnight , 4 ◦ C with secondary antibodies ( goat anti - mouse conjugated with 415 STAR RED ( 1 : 300 ) and goat anti - rabbit conjugated with Alaxa 488 ( 1 : 300 ) ) in 4 % 416 BSA - PBST . Finally , samples were washed three times with 1 ml PBST and mounted in 417 Vectashield H - 1000 under # 1 . 5 selected cover glass . 418 An overview of the oligopaint probe sets is shown in table 2 . Full oligo sequences and 419 scripts used in probe design are provided as a supplementary file . The raw image data 420 and analysis scripts are provided in the form of Zenodo repositories , see Data Availability 421 statement . 422 Staining of a repetitive region to establish fluorescence in - situ hybridization 423 To test the FISH procedure without the need of a full oligopaint library , a single probe 424 against a repetitive region was designed . The zebrafish genome was screened for long 425 repetitive regions using BLAST . A region containing 100 repeats on chromosome 25 426 was selected ( repeat sequence : 5’ - CCGACGCATCTTCGTGCTGG CTTACATACTC - 427 CGCTGCACC AATGACTTGAATTGCAGCCT TGGGCGTATGCTGCTC ) . Probes 428 were produced by the same protocol used for actual oligopaint production , using a primer 429 Alexa Fluor 594 - conjugation at the 5’ end ( Thermofisher ) . Primer sequences are shown 430 in Tab . 1 ) . 431 OligoPaint probe library 432 Genes were chosen based on their Pol II Ser5P ChIP - Seq from Zhang et al . , 2014 433 [ 74 ] . For each gene , Pol II Ser5P ChIP - Seq peaks in the promoter region ( 2 kb region 434 upstream from the gene ) was called using MACS2 [ 75 ] . For each peak , a p - value , q - value 435 ( Benjamini - Hochberg corrected p - value ) and a signal value ( fold enrichment of peak 436 against background ) was calculated . The peaks with p - value < 10 − 5 , q - value < 10 − 4 437 and signal value > 3 were chosen . For these genes RNA - Seq data from White et al . 438 2017 , were compared [ 76 ] .

Microscopy data from live human cheek cells , live and fixed zebrafish embryos 453 were recorded using a commercial implementation of the instant - SIM high - speed super - 454 resolution confocal microscopy principle ( VisiTech iSIM ) [ 33 ] . The microscope was build 455 on a Nikon Ti2 - E stand . For live imaging a Nikon Silicone Immersion Objective ( NA 456 1 . 35 , CFI SR HP Plan Apochromat Lambda S 100XC Sil ) and for fixed imaging a Nikon 457 Oil Immersion Objective ( NA 1 . 49 , CFI SR HP Apo TIRF 100XAC Oil ) were used . 458 Laser at 405 nm , 488 nm , 561 nm and 642 nm were used for excitation . The acquisition 459 settings were kept constant across all samples of a given experimental repeat . 460 461 Optimizing the exposure time for high - speed time - lapse imaging : In the 462 process , on the one hand , time lapse recordings with a short exposure time of 150 ms , 463 100 ms , 70 ms , 40 ms or 20 ms were recorded every 5 seconds ( 21 loops ) , on the other 464 hand , successive recordings with different exposure times ( short , long , long , short , short ) 465 were recorded , in which “long” corresponds to an exposure time of 300 ms . For each 466 exposure time a different cell nucleus was recorded . For each nucleus , on the one hand 467 successive recording with different exposure times ( short , long , long , short , short ) , on 468 the other hand , time lapse images with the corresponding short exposure time for a total 469 duration of 2 minutes , were recorded ( see table 4 ) . For each exposure time images from 470 three embryos were recorded . 471 Condition Exposure time Full z - stack interval Number of z - stacks High - quality 200 ms 6 s 21 Shortened 100 ms 3 s 41 Shortened 50 ms 2 s 61 Shortened 20 ms 1 s 121 Shortened 10 ms 1 s 121 Table 4 . Time - lapse parameters for high - speed imaging of Pol II clusters in live zebrafish embryos . total duration of time - lapse was 2 min . Noise2Void processing of STED microscopy data 472 For each nucleus , a pair of low - quality images a high - quality image were acquired . 473 We first trained an n2v - network on the low - quality images 1 and reconstructed both 474 low - quality images using this n2v - network . 475 Noise2Void processing of cheek cell microscopy data 476 For each acquired position , we trained an n2v - network on the first low - quality image 477 and reconstructed both low - quality images with the trained network . Procedures were 478 reviewed and accepted by the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology ethics committee . Raw 479 image data were stored in an anonymous fashion and are not for public release . 480 Metrics for image assessment 481 The SSIM metric for the comparison of images x and y is given by SSIM ( x , y ) = (cid:26) 2 µ x µ y + C 1 µ 2 x + µ 2 y + C 1 (cid:27) α × (cid:26) 2 σ x σ y + C 2 σ 2 x + σ 2 y + C 2 (cid:27) β × (cid:26) 2 σ x , y + C 3 σ x σ y + C 3 (cid:27) γ 15 where C 1 , C 2 and C 3 are constants with the default value of 0 . 01 and 0 . 03 , C 2 / 2 respectively . With three constant α , β and γ ( default values are ( 1 , 1 , 1 ) ) , the contribution of each term can be defined . µ x and µ y are the mean over each of the images’ pixel intensities , σ x and σ y are the standard deviations , and σ x , y the covariance of the two images’ pixel intensity values . The first , second and the third term are respectively called luminance ( mean ) , contrast ( standard deviation ) and structural ( covariance ) . As the standard deviation of an image is not usually affected by denoising [ 46 ] , in our experiment , we only focused on luminance and structural term and we investigated how luminance and structural terms of SSIM depend on the duration of photon collection in integrating versus averaging mode detectors . We observed that , for integrating detectors , the mean term influences the SSIM value , so that structural reliability cannot be directly compared if this term is included in the calculation of the SSIM value ( Fig . S1A - D ) . For SSIM and local SSIM analysis , we therefore only consider the structural term , given by SSIM ( x , y ) = 2 σ x , y + C 3 σ x σ y + C 3 In local SSIM experiments , we used a Gaussian kernel with standard deviation of 12 482 pixels for weighting the neighborhood pixels around a pixel . 483 The Fourier ring correlation ( FRC ) analysis is based on the cross - correlation of two images in frequency space , and relies on the assumption that the two images are two independent reconstructions of the same object with independent noise realizations . The spatial frequency spectra of the two images are first divided into bins , which are in turn sorted by location within ring - shaped regions relative to the center of the Fourier spectrum polar coordinates . The FRC curve then is calculated based on the cross - correlation of the power values over all bins for a given ring radius , r , as follows : FRC ( r ) = (cid:80) r i ∈ r F 1 ( r i ) · F 2 ( r i ) ∗ (cid:113)(cid:80) r i ∈ r ( F 1 ( r i ) ) 2 · (cid:80) r i ∈ r ( F 2 ( r i ) ) 2 where F 1 , F 2 are the Fourier transforms of two images and r i refers to all frequency 484 space bins that fall within a given ring radius r . The cut - off spatial frequency is the 485 smallest r value for which the FRC ( r ) value drops below the widely used threshold 486 value of 1 / 7 . Up to the spatial frequency given by 1 / r , the object is considered to be 487 reliably resolved . 488 Analysis of morphology fluctuations in RNA polymerase II clus - 489 ters 490 Input images are recruited RNA polymerase II ( Ser2P and Ser5P ) in live zebrafish 491 embryos visualized with antibody fragments ( Fab ) labelled with Janelia Fluor ( Kimura 492 Lab , Tokyo Tech ) , consisting of two channels , Pol II Ser2P and Pol II Ser5P , recorded by 493 our proposed phase - AB imaging protocol ( Fig . 3 ) with phase B spanning a time of 2 min . 494 Data are specifically recorded for four different exposure times ( t exp = 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 ms ) 495 ( Fig . S4A ) . 496 Noise2Void denoising We run the n2v script on Google Colab at the beginning of 497 every exposure time for channel 2 ( Pol II Ser5P ) images . The patches which are 498 given to the network are of size ( 16 , 64 , 64 ) , while 45 of the patches were used to 499 train the network and 15 of all patches were used for the validation . We leave the 500 network to be trained on each image for 70 epochs with the neighbourhood radius 501 = 10 . After assessing the n2v - processed images with FRC and local SSIM ( Fig . 502 S4 ) , time - lapse Ser5P series recorded by 20 and 50 ms exposure time were selected 503 16 and reconstructed using the trained network . The Pol II Ser2P time - lapse series 504 left unchanged . 505 Median filter After n2v - recovery of Pol II Ser5P series , to recover the signal a median 506 filter of size 100 pixel is conducted on both Pol II Ser2P and Ser5P images . 507 3D segmentation We used an adaptive threshold based on the neighbourhood of size 508 [ 101 , 101 ] to segment each focus of Pol II ser5p images in 3 dimensions . Adapt 509 threshold is a local threshold calculated based on the local mean intensity ( first - 510 order statistics ) in the neighbourhood of each pixel . The Pol II Ser5P foci are 511 segmented in 3 dimensions and the equivalent area in Pol II Ser2P images is also 512 masked . 513 Foci tracking Then , each focus is to be tracked over time . The distances between foci 514 are used as the metric of tracking . Tracking was continued if a focus disappeared 515 at t n and again appeared at t n + 1 . We then extracted and saved the foci which 516 lasted longer than 70 s for the further analysis . 517 2D segmentation We then picked the middle plane of each 3D focus and segment 518 the middle plane in 2 dimensions . The plane which is used for 2D segmentation 519 is rough of size ( 100 × 100 ) pixels . An adaptive threshold is again used for 2D 520 segmentation ( Fig . 4B and Fig . S5A ) . 521 Shape quantification For each focus , we reported four properties ( Ser2P mean inten - 522 sity , Ser5P mean intensity , solidity , area and elongation ) ( Fig . 4C and Fig . S5B ) . 523 If the focus lost at t n and again appeared at t n + 1 , the average quantification 524 of the focis at t n − 1 and t n + 1 is instead considered . The elongation property is 525 calculated by the division of the major axis and the minor axis of the focus . For the 526 calculation of Ser2p mean intensity property , the corresponding Ser5P segmented 527 area in Ser2P images is considered . For Ser5P intensity property , the intensities of 528 central pixels ( rough of size 9 × 9 pixels ) is averaged . 529 Correlation analysis In this step , time lagged ( [ − 20 , 20 ] ) cross correlation between 3 530 pairs of ( Ser5P intensity , elongation ) , ( Ser2P intensity , elongation ) and ( Solidity , 531 elongation ) are quantified ( Fig . 4D , Fig . S5C ) . 532 Pseudo - time analysis from single time point fluorescence images 533 In this analysis , we work with still images of Pol II clusters , which were obtained from 534 fixed zebrafish embryos . While these do not allow tracking Pol II clusters over time , 535 the additional oligopaint fluorescence label can be used as information to sort images 536 along hypothetical timeline . The pseudo - time analysis used for this sorting approach 537 works under the assumption that , in cases where genes engage with Pol II clusters for 538 transcriptional activation , a stereotyped sequence of events occurs that includes changes 539 in Pol II phosphorylation , cluster shape changes , and association of the gene with a 540 given cluster . Based on this assumption , the goal of this analysis is to reproduce such a 541 stereotypical sequence by sorting Pol II cluster - gene pairs detected from an ensemble of 542 still images 543 Nuclei were segmented by Otsu thresholding of blurred ( Gaussian blurring , σ = 544 1 . 0 µ m ) and background - subtracted ( after Gaussian blurring , σ . = 10 µ m ) . Only nuclei 545 with a volume greater than 40 µ m 3 and a solidity greater than 0 . 7 were retained for 546 further analysis . Pol II clusters were segmented inside each nucleus separately by robust 547 background thresholding ( 2 standard deviations above intensity mean ) after background 548 subtraction ( 3 . 0 µ m ) from the Pol II Ser5P channel . Only Pol II clusters with a volume 549 greater than 0 . 03 µ m 3 were retained for further analysis . Oligopaint - labeled genes were 550 17 detected by robust background thresholding ( 6 standard deviations above intensity mean ) 551 of smoothed ( Gaussian blurring , σ = 100 nm ) and background - subtracted ( Gaussian 552 blurring , σ = 5 µ m ) images of the oligpaint channel . Only objects with a volume greater 553 than 0 . 05 µ m 3 were retained for further analysis . 554 Gene - cluster interactions should be detectable by spatial proximity of a given gene to 555 a Pol II cluster . The analysis thus connects any detected gene to the nearest neighboring 556 Pol II cluster ( Euclidean distance , Fig . S6B ) , resulting in a cluster - gene pair . These 557 cluster - gene pairs are from here on treated as single observations , the remaining task is 558 to sort these cluster - gene pairs into a coherent sequence . Only gene - cluster pairs with a 559 cluster volume greater than 0 . 2 µ m 3 were retained for further analysis . 560 The sorting of cluster - gene pairs is based on a mapping of correlated changes in the 561 properties of cluster - gene pairs . Specifically , each cluster - gene pair is represented as a 562 point an 8 - dimensional feature space ( R 7 ) defined by the gene and cluster properties 563 ( S6B ) . Application of a principal component analysis ( PCA ) to this ensemble of R 8 564 coordinates allows an effective reduction of dimensionality , and provides a mapping 565 into distinct regions in the space spanned by the two first principal components ( Fig . 566 S6C ) . Plotting the projections of cluster volume and gene Ser5P level ( check what the 567 support lines actually are ) into this PCA plot , an orthogonal coordinate system can 568 be defined ( Fig . S6C ) . Using only linear transformations ( rotation and reflection ) , the 569 cluster volume can be used as one axis of the coordinate system , and the gene Pol Ser5P 570 placed to the left side of the plot . Inside this plot , data points can now be directly 571 sorted in clock - wise order , providing a pseudo - time sorted dataset ( Fig . S6C ) . This 572 pseudo - time sorting is only successful when a gene engages in close contact with Pol II 573 clusters with an increased frequency ( centroid - centroid distance threshold for contact 574 detection of 200 nm ) ; genes that only engage Pol II clusters less often do not exhibit a 575 useful pseudo - time sorting ( Fig . S6D ) . 576 For the pseudo - time - sorted data points , a periodic progress coordinate s ∈ [ 0 , 1 ) can be defined , assigning to each data point i a coordinate s = n i / N , where n i is the pseudo - time sorted index of the data point i in a data set consisting of 577 a total of N data points . This progress coordinate can , in turn , be used to carry out 578 cross - correlation analyses , based on a pseud - time shift ∆ s ( Fig . S7 ) . For genes with 579 high frequencies of engagement with Pol II clusters , this cross - correlation analysis closely 580 reproduces the relationship between cluster morphology and Pol II Ser5 phosphorylation 581 seen in our live imaging experiments ( Fig . S7 foxd5 , klf2b , zgc : : 64002 ) . For genes 582 with lower frequencies of engagement , the clear patterns of correlation between cluster 583 elongation and Pol II Ser5 phosphorylation are not detected ( Fig . S7 vamp2 , ripply1 , 584 drll . 2 , gadd45ga , iscub ) . 585 Data Availability 586 Scripts and raw data are available at the following URLs . 587 Microscopy data and scripts for analysis of local SSIM and FRC in live zebrafish 588 embryos : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 5281 / zenodo . 5568871 589 Python scripts for assessment of different SSIM terms for integrating vs . averaging 590 photon collection : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 5281 / zenodo . 5569195 591 Scripts for SSIM and Fourier ring correlation analysis of Noise2Void - reconstructed 592 STED images : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 5281 / zenodo . 5569432 593 Microscopy data of RNA Pol II CTD phosphorylation in live zebrafish embryos : 594 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 5281 / zenodo . 5566880 595 18 Scripts used for morphology fluctuations analysis in Pol II clusters : 596 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 5281 / zenodo . 5569475 597 Matlab scripts used in the analysis of oligopaint - immunofluorescence image data : 598 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 5281 / zenodo . 5524939 599 Microscopy data for the gene drll . 2 : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 5281 / zenodo . 5266592 600 Microscopy data for the gene iscub : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 5281 / zenodo . 5266736 601 Microscopy data for the gene vamp2 : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 5281 / zenodo . 5266903 602 Microscopy data for the gene gadd45ga : ttps : / / doi . org / 10 . 5281 / zenodo . 5268538 603 Microscopy data for the gene foxd5 : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 5281 / zenodo . 5266995 604 Microscopy data for the gene klf2b : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 5281 / zenodo . 5268833 605 Microscopy data for the gene ripply1 : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 5281 / zenodo . 5268779 606 Microscopy data for the gene zgc : : 64022 : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 5281 / zenodo . 5268683 607 Acknowledgement 608 This work is supported by the Helmholtz Association under the joint research school 609 “HIDSS4Health – Helmholtz Information and Data Science School for Health” and the 610 Helmholtz program Natural , Artificial , and Cognitive Information Processing ( NACIP ) . 611 HH was supported by HIDSS4Health , IM and LH were supported by the Priority 612 Program Molecular Mechanisms of Functional Phase Separation of the German Science 613 Foundation ( DFG - SPP2191 ) .

Structural similarity is a metric of proper structure . Figures are DNA distribution in a nucleus in a fixed zebrafish embryo , obtained by stimulated emission depletion ( STED ) microscopy . A ) Depending on the microscope detector type and settings , photons can be accumulated over time without normalization ( integrating detector ) or with normalization ( averaging detector ) . To illustrate how the different terms of the structural similarity index metric ( SSIM ) depend on the duration of photon collection in the integrating type detector , images were acquired with line - repeat scans in the accumulation mode , using increasing numbers of line repetitions ( 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 ) , accumulation steps . B ) In the integrating detector case , the luminance ( mean ) as well as the structural ( covariance ) term of the SSIM depend on the number of accumulation steps . Overall SSIM values contain contributions from both terms , so that an assessment of structural reliability would be obscured by changes in overall image intensity . SSIM values were calculated based on n = 6 images obtained by a reduced number of accumulation steps and a reference image obtained with the highest number of accumulation steps ( 16 ) . Individual values are shown with the mean . C ) To illustrate how the different terms of the SSIM metric depend on the duration of photon collection in the averaging detector type , DNA images were acquired with the detector is left open to collect photons at each pixel for longer times ( dwell time t ) , then the photon count is normalized by the dwell time t . D ) In the integrating detector case , the luminance term is constant and close to the value of 1 . 0 . Only the structural term changes with increasing t , so that also the overall SSIM values directly reflect structural reliability for a given t . SSIM values were calculated based on n = 6 images obtained for a given t , combined with a matching image recorded with the highest t = 10ms . Individual values are shown with the mean . 2 A B Fig S2 . Fourier ring correlation can quantify improvements in effective image resolution obtained by Noise2Void reconstruction . A ) DNA distribution in micrographs of nuclei in a fixed zebrafish embryo , obtained by stimulated emission depletion ( STED ) microscopy . Low quality image 1 and 2 are acquired with identical acquisition settings . Reconstructed image 1 and 2 are obtained by Noise2Void reconstruction from the low quality images 1 and 2 , respectively . The high quality image was acquired in the same scanning sequence as the low quality images , but included accumulation by repeated line - scanning to improve image quality . B ) Fourier ring correlation ( FRC ) analysis to determine the improvement in effective resolution of reconstructed images relative to the unprocessed low quality images . 3 Fig S3 .

C ) Corresponding high quality reference images captured with an t exp of 200ms . D ) Effective resolution as determined by FRC analysis for low quality images , reconstructed images , and high quality images for the indicated t exp . n = 4 , 3 , 3 values from N = 3 different embryos are shown with the mean . E ) Average SSIM values based on the 5 % lowest local SSIM values of the 5 % brightest pixels . n = 4 , 4 , 3 values from N = 3 different embryos are shown with the mean . 5 Fig S5 .

A ) Representative series of time - lapse images showing a single RNA polymerase II cluster in the Pol II Ser5p channel ( single image plane from the middle z position of the cluster , exposure time t exp = 20ms , effective time resolution for acquisition of full 3D volumes 1 s ) . B ) Time courses of the Pol II Ser5P intensity , the Pol II Ser2P intensity , elongation , and solidity for the example track shown in panel A . C ) Cross - correlation analysis Gray lines indicate the analysis results for individual cluster time - courses , thick lines the mean over all analyzed clusters , the gray region is the bootstrap 95 % confidence interval . Analysis based on n = 27 clusters , recorded from one sphere - stage embryo . 6 Fig S6 . Single images of clusters from fixed embryos can be sorted in pseudo - time based on their interaction with visiting genes . A ) Example micrographs of a nucleus of a fixed sphere - stage zebrafish embryo with Pol II Ser5P , Pol II Ser2P , and oligopaint fluorescence in situ hybridization ( target gene foxd5 ) signal . B ) Sketch of properties extracted from Pol II Ser5P cluster - oligopaint nearest neighbor pairs . C ) Overview of the pseudp - time reconstruction procedure in the case of a gene with a high frequency of visiting Pol II Ser5P clusters ( quantified as the fraction f of observations with less than 200nm distance between the oligopaint signal and the nearest Pol II Ser5P cluster , d ) . The top three principal component ( PC ) support vectors are displayed ( top two PC vectors are sorted so that the top vector has the higher weight in the volume dimension ) . The two top vectors are used to plot single observations in a two - dimensional overview plot . A rotation and inversion transformation are then applied to ensure the always the volume points exactly North , and the oligopaints Pol II Ser5P intensity towards the West half of the graph . Values can now be sorted according to angle relative to the direction North , and a running average over these angles indicates how well the sorted values are distributed away from the coordinate origin . In the case of the gene foxd5 , a clear separation away from the origin can be seen , indicating a successful sorting by pseudo - time . D ) In the case of the gene iscub , which does not frequently associate closely with Pol II Ser5P clusters , the individual points form a single cloud close to the origin and the running average line is also close to the coordinate origin , indicating that the attempt of sorting by a pseudo - time coordinate is not successful . 7 Fig S7 . Pseudo - time sorting reproduces correlation analysis results only for genes that frequently associate with RNA polymerase II clusters . Results of the pseudo - time sorting for eight genes that were labeled oligopaint fluorescence in - situ hybridization . Percentage of contact ( f ) is calculated as the percentage of OP - cluster pairs with distance d of 200nm or less . Shown are the pseudo - time sorted oligopaint - cluster distance , the Pol II Ser5P and Ser2P signals at the oligopaint - labeled gene ( OP S5P , OP S2P , normalized against the whole nucleus median intensity ) , the Pol II Ser5P and Ser2P intensity at the nearest Pol II Ser5P cluster ( Cl . S5P , Cl . S2P ) , cluster volume ( Cl . Vol . ) , cluster elongation ( Cl . Elo . ) , and cluster solidity ( Cl . Sol . ) . The coordinate s represents the progress in pseudo - time . A register shift in pseudo - time was used to calculate the cross - correlation between cluster Pol II Ser5P intensity and elongation , cluster Pol II Ser2P intensity and elongation , and cluster solidity and elongation . Number of cluster - gene pairs included in the analysis indicated as n for each gene . For each gene , images were recorded from four samples , distributed over two independent experiments . 8
