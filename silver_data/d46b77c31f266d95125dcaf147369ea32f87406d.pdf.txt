Integrins undergo constant endo / exocytic shuttling to facilitate the dynamic reg - ulation of cell adhesion . Integrin activity toward the components of the extracellular matrix is regulated by the ability of these receptors to switch between active and inactive conformations . Several cellular signalling pathways have been described in the regulation of integrin trafﬁc under different conditions . However , the interrelationship between integrin activity conformations and their endocytic fate have remained incompletely understood . Here , we have investigated the endocytic trafﬁcking of active and inactive β 1 integrins in cancer cells . Both conformers are endocytosed in a clathrin - and dynamin - dependent manner . The net endocytosis rate of the active β 1 integrins is higher , whereas endocytosis of the inactive β 1 integrin is counteracted by rapid recycling back to the plasma membrane via an ARF6 - and early endosome antigen 1 - positive compartment in an Rab4a - and actin - dependent manner . Owing to these distinct trafﬁcking routes , the two receptor pools display divergent subcellular localization . At steady state , the inactive β 1 integrin is mainly on the plasma membrane , whereas the active receptor is predominantly intracellular . These data provide new insights into the endocytic trafﬁc of integrins and imply the possibility of a previously unappreciated crosstalk between pathways regulating integrin activity and trafﬁc .

Integrins are a large family of heterodimeric cell surface adhesion receptors consisting of 24 non - covalently associated α Re - use of this article is permitted in accordance with the Terms and Conditions set out at http : / / wileyonlinelibrary . com / onlineopen # OnlineOpen _ Terms and β subunits with overlapping substrate binding ( 2 ) . The binding of extracellular matrix ligands to integrin heterodimers induces a conformational change in the extracellular β subunit , followed by a separation of the α / β cytoplasmic tails ( 3 , 4 ) . The tail separation creates space for binding of many cytoskeletal proteins and adaptor proteins ( APs ) , leading to a focal adhesion complex build - up in the cytosolic interface ( 5 ) . Integrin - containing adhesions allow cells to exert adhesion forces between different parts of the cell body which is a prerequisite for cell shape changes and cell motility ( 6 , 7 ) . In migrating cells , membrane trafﬁcking is orchestrated with the actin cytoskeleton to promote the formation of new adhesions and lamellipodial protrusions on the cell . Endocytosis and recycling of integrins , growth factor receptors and lipids is necessary for maintaining cell polarization and to co - ordinate the formation and release of cell - substrate attachments ( 1 , 8 ) . Integrins are known to undergo constant endo / exocytic trafﬁc in adherent cells ( 9 ) . The endocytosed integrins are predominantly recycled back to the membrane . In comparison to receptor trafﬁc , the degradation of integrins is slow . The pool of cell surface α 5 β 1 integrins is endocytosed and recycled once every 30min back to plasma membrane ( 10 , 11 ) , whereas the half - life of integrin α 5 β 1 in lysosomal degradation is 18h ( 12 ) . This highlights the importance of integrin trafﬁc in cell migration and in the maintenance of an appropriate balance between internalized and cell surface integrins in cells . The endocytosis of integrin heterodimers occurs by clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent mechanisms . Ligand occupied α 2 β 1 is internalized in a clathrin / Rab21 - dependent manner ( 13 , 14 ) , whereas α 5 β 1 , α V β 3 and virus / antibody clustered α 2 β 1 have been shown to associate with caveolin - 1 ( 15 ) . However , the same heterodimer may use multiple pathways for endocytosis . For example , α 5 β 1 integrin endocytosis is caveolin dependent during ﬁbronectin assembly ( 16 ) , but clathrin - dependent endocytosis of α 5 β 1 has been described in migrating cells as well as during cytokinesis ( 17 , 18 ) . Thus far , four integrin recycling pathways have been described : The Rab4 - dependent short - loop , Rab11 - dependent long - loop , stimulation - dependent ARF6 path - way and tubular actin - dependent recycling endosomes . Integrin α V β 3 has been shown to cycle via the short - loop pathway , whereas β 1 integrins have been described to trafﬁc via the long - loop route ( 10 , 19 , 20 ) . The actin - dependent recycling pathway has been described for β 1 integrins and for β 2 adrenergic receptor ( 21 , 22 ) . In addition to integrin trafﬁcking , integrin activity has a clear impact on cell motility as well . Extracellular matrix 610 www . trafﬁc . dk Distinct Recycling of Active and Inactive β 1 Integrins ( ECM ) ligand concentrations , integrin expression levels and integrin – ECM binding afﬁnities all contribute to cell migration ( 23 ) . The activity of integrins is based on the conformation of the heterodimeric receptor . The current model suggests an equilibrium among ( i ) an inactive , bent conformation with a closed headpiece , ( ii ) a primed , extended conformation with a closed headpiece and ( iii ) an active , extended conformation with a ligand bound open headpiece ( 3 ) . It has been suggested that β 1 integrins are mainly in an inactive conformation at the cell surface ( 24 ) . Integrin activation occurs via inside - out or outside - in signalling events . These trigger intracellular conforma - tional changes and the separation of the cytoplasmic tails . The conformational change from a bent to an extended conformation increases integrin - ligand afﬁnity ( 25 , 26 ) . The inside - out activation of integrins is induced by binding of cytoplasmic adaptors like talin - 1 / 2 and kindlin - 1 / 2 / 3 to the β 1 integrin cytoplasmic tail . Integrin activity is inhibited by binding of Shank - associated RH domain - interacting protein ( SHARPIN ) to the α - cytoplasmic tail ( 27 ) . Individual studies have indicated differences in the endocy - tosis of active and inactive integrin β 1 conformations . Focal adhesions are known to contain clustered , talin - associated and ECM - bound integrins ( 28 ) . The disassembly of focal adhesions involves clathrin / Dab2 / Arh - dependent endocy - tosis of ECM - bound α 5 β 1 integrins ( 29 , 30 ) . Thus , this pathway would be predicted to target activated integrins for uptake . However , clathrin adaptor Dab2 - dependent endocytosis has also been shown to target free non - occupied α 1 β 1 , α 2 β 1 and α 3 β 1 integrins ( 31 ) . Another clathrin adaptor , Numb , is involved in focal adhesion dis - assembly and in β 1 integrin endocytosis , but the activity status of these integrins remains unclear ( 17 ) . Neuropilin - 1 has been linked to endocytosis of active α 5 β 1 integrin in endothelial cells ( 32 ) , and endocytosis of inactive α 2 β 1 integrins is induced during echovirus 1 internalization into cells ( 33 ) . However , because of different cell lines and experimental methodology used , these data are difﬁcult to compare and to the best of our knowledge , a compre - hensive analysis of the trafﬁcking of inactive and active pools of β 1 integrins is missing . Here , we have studied the endocytic trafﬁcking of active and inactive β 1 integrins . Using antibody - based detection , we demonstrate distinct trafﬁcking kinetics for active and inactive β 1 integrins . The net endocytosis rate of active β 1 integrin is higher , whereas the inactive β 1 integrin endocytosis is increasingly shifted toward Rab4a and actin - dependent recycling back to the plasma membrane protrusions . Results Active β 1integrinsarepredominantlycytoplasmic , whereasinactive β 1integrinslocalizetotheplasma membraneandprotrusions Monoclonal anti - integrin β 1 antibodies have been well characterized , and their ability to detect conformation - dependent epitopes has been deﬁned ( 34 ) . We measured the levels of active and inactive β 1 integrin expressions on cell surface using ﬂow cytometry and epitope - speciﬁc antibodies . In three independent cancer cell lines ( NCI - H460 , PC - 3 and MDA - MB - 231 ) , the cell surface β 1 integrins were found to be mainly in the inactive conformation ( mAb13 and 4B4 ) , whereas approximately only 20 % of cell surface β 1 integrins were in the active conformation ( 12G10 and 9EG7 ) ( Figure 1A ) . This is in line with a previous report ( 24 ) . Interestingly , the immunoﬂuorescence staining of ﬁxed , unstimulated NCI - H460 lung carcinoma cells shows distinct localizations of active and inactive β 1 integrins . Confocal mid - sections of cells reveal that active β 1 integrins ( detected with 9EG7 , Huts - 21 and 12G10 mAbs ) are more intracellular and show endosomal staining inside the cell body ( Figure 1B ) . Conversely , the inactive β 1 integrins ( detected with mAb13 , 1998 , P1H5 and 4B4 mAbs ) localize to the plasma membrane and to protrusions ( Figure 1B , C ) . The total β 1 integrin pool stained with K20 antibody shows intracellular and plasma membrane staining . At the bottom of cells , the active β 1 integrin shows punctate - and focal contact - like staining throughout the basal side of the cell ( Figure 1C ) . The inactive β 1 integrin is highly enriched in protrusions at the cell edges ( Figure 1C ) . Furthermore , total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence microscopy shows that the active β 1 integrins are more clustered at the plasma membrane compared to the inactive conformation ( Figure 1D ) . On the basis of these observations , we hypothesized that the endosomal trafﬁcking of integrins would be different for the active and the inactive receptors . Theactive β 1integrinisinternalizedmoreefﬁciently thantheinactiveconformation The differences in the cell surface β 1 integrin levels and in the staining patterns of ﬁxed cells at steady state would implicate preferred endocytosis of the active integrins . Thus , we labelled cell surface β 1 integrins in living cells with monoclonal primary antibodies against active and inactive conformations . A previous study using antibodies to study integrin endocytosis obtained identical trafﬁcking results with immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) molecules and monovalent Fab - fragments , suggesting that the possible clustering effect of IgG - molecules has no signiﬁcant impact on integrin trafﬁc ( 21 ) . We followed the endocytosis of antibody - labelled cell surface integrins in serum - containing medium without additional stimulation of cells . The primary antibody chase showed signiﬁcantly more endocytosis of active β 1 integrin recognizing anti - bodies compared to the inactive β 1 integrins ( Figure 2A , B ) . Antibody - andquenching - basedmethodallows directmeasurementofintegrintrafﬁcking To better analyse β 1 integrin endocytic trafﬁcking , we developed a ﬂuorescence - based assay to measure the endocytosis and recycling rates of β 1 integrins ( Figure 3A ) .

The quenching antibody has previously been successfully used to study the endocytosis of CD8 ( 35 ) . We tested our method using a ﬂuorescent multiwell plate - reader to analyse integrin endocytosis in adherent cells and ﬂow cytometry to analyse cells in suspension under similar conditions . Endocytosis is temperature dependent and clearly more efﬁcient in adherent cells ( Figure S1B ) . To validate the results of the antibody - based integrin trafﬁcking method , we reproduced the experiments using previously published cell surface biotinylation , immuno - precipitation and western blotting - based assays for 612 Trafﬁc2012 ; 13 : 610 – 625 Distinct Recycling of Active and Inactive β 1 Integrins Endocytosed active integrin β 1 12G10 9EG7 mAb13 4B4 ) % ( 1 β n i r ge t n i de s o t yc odn E 12G10 9EG7 mAb13 4B4 p = 0 . 28 p = 0 . 0001 p < 0 . 0001 p = 0 . 0299 A B Midslice Midslice p = 0 . 3802 Inactive integrin β 1 Active integrin β 1 0 10 20 30 40 50 Endocytosed inactive integrin β 1 60 Figure 2 : The active β 1 integrin is internalized more efﬁciently than the inactive conformation .

The antibody - based assay showed sim - ilar kinetics and end - point rates of β 1 integrin endocytosis and recycling as the biotin - immunoprecipitation ( IP ) - based assay . Approximately 45 % of the cell surface β 1 integrins were endocytosed in 30min ( Figure 3B ) in MDA - MB - 231 cells . PC - 3 cells showed similar kinetics of β 1 integrin endocytosis with both assays ( Figure S2A ) . The recycling of β 1 integrins was approximately 70 % in 30min with the biotin – IP assay . A slightly lower 30 - min end - point rate of β 1 integrin endocytosis was obtained with the antibody - based assay , but the kinetics were nearly the same ( Figure 3C ) . Blocking of endosomal recycling with the anti - malaria drug Primaquine ( PQ ) , an established inhibitor of integrin recycling ( 36 , 37 ) , showed a clear inhibitory effect in our antibody - based assay ( Figure 3C ) . Similar levels of β 1 inte - grin endocytosis and recycling were also measured with ELISA - based detection in biotin – IP assay ( Figure S2B , C ) . There were differences in the sensitivity , linearity and the total signals depending of the detection method . However , none of the methods produced signiﬁcantly discrepant results or showed systematically lower or higher kinetics or end - point rates . Therefore , we conclude that our antibody - based assay is a valid method to detect integrin trafﬁc in cells . Cellsurfaceboundmonoclonalanti - β 1integrin antibodiesdonotsigniﬁcantlytriggerdownstream signalling The labelling of the cell surface with activating anti - β 1 integrin antibodies could in theory induce cell signalling and thus lead to increased endocytosis . In order to evaluate the effects of antibody labelling in live cells , we tested whether the labelling regime used in the trafﬁcking assays would inﬂuence downstream integrin signalling . Addition of anti - β 1 integrin antibodies ( 9EG7 , 12G10 and mAb13 ) with or without secondary antibody clustering or ﬁbronectin ligand to the cell surface did not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase 1 and p42 / 44 ( Figure S3 ) . On the basis of these data , we conclude that integrin labelling used here and in previous work published by us and others does not signiﬁcantly trigger integrin signalling in cells . Active β 1integrinhashighernetendocytosisrate andco - trafﬁcswithligand Having validated the antibody - based trafﬁc assay , we compared the endocytic rates of different β 1 integrin cell surface populations using antibody chase as a function of time . In line with the previous primary antibody - chase experiments , both the active and inactive β 1 integrin conformations were endocytosed in a time - dependent manner ( Figure 4A ) . We veriﬁed the results using three cancer cell lines ( PC - 3 , MDA - MB - 231 and NCI - H460 , respectively ) . The active β 1 integrin showed signiﬁcantly higher net endocytosis rates when compared to the inactive conformer or the total pool of all β 1 integrins in all three cell lines . Fibronectin has been detected in integrin - containing endosomes ( 13 , 38 ) . In addition , ubiquitination followed by FN - ligand binding targets a fraction of α 5 β 1 integrin to speciﬁc lysosomal compartments ( 12 ) .

As expected , the co - endocytosis and overlap of active β 1 integrin and the FN - fragment were higher ( Pearson’s correlation , PC = 0 . 4 ) than with the inactive β 1 integrin ( PC = 0 . 15 ) . The inactive β 1 integrin was not endocytosed together with ligand - engaged integrins ( Figure 4B ) . In summary , these data suggest distinct trafﬁcking of active and inactive β 1 integrins . The active integrin is co - endocytosed and co - trafﬁcked with the ligand . In contrast , the unoccupied inactive integrin is not signiﬁcantly present in ligand - containing structures and shows reduced net endocytosis .

Active and inactive β 1 integrins were clearly found in Rab5 - , Rab4a - and Rab21 - positive compartments 30min after endocytosis ( Figure 5A , B ) .

One hundred and twenty minutes after endocytosis , Rab11 perinuclear recycling compartment ( PNRC ) was also positive for both conformations , whereas Rab25 showed no clear colocalization in either time - points ( Figure S4B ) . These observations indicate that ligand occupied β 1 integrins may be en route to lysosomal degradation as has been suggested before ( 12 ) . The observed difference does not directly explain the higher net endocytic rate of active β 1 integrin as both conformations colocalize to the same extent with early endosomal markers ( Rab5 and Rab21 ) and fast - loop recycling endosome marker ( Rab4a ) .

Dynamin - 2 mutant K44A blocks the dynamin - dependent abscission of endocytic vesicles ( 40 ) . Eps15 lacking the EH domains disturbs the AP2 – clathrin complex formation and thus blocks clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( 41 ) . N - terminally enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein ( EGFP ) - tagged caveolin - 1 has been shown to function as a dominant negative ( DN ) inhibitor of SV40 internalization into cells ( 42 ) . Antibody chase against active and inactive β 1 integrins in the transfected cells showed that dynamin - 2 K44A and Eps15 EH29 inhibited the endocytosis of both conformations , whereas the EGFP - caveolin - 1 ( DN ) had no effect on the endocytosis of either conformation ( Figure 6 ) . We used transferrin endocytosis ( known to be clathrin and dynamin dependent ( 43 ) ) as a positive control and to validate the functionality of the system ( Figure S5A ) .

To test this , we labelled the cell surface simultaneously with antibodies against active and inactive β 1 integrins . After a 30 - min antibody chase , the cells were ﬁxed , counterstained and analysed . Again , the staining of the inactive β 1 integrin was mostly seen at the plasma membrane , whereas the active β 1 integrin was more intracellular ( Figure 7A ) . Interestingly , the overlap between endocytosed active and inactive β 1 integrin increased signiﬁcantly ( from 0 . 32 to 0 . 6 PC ) after inhibiting the recycling from endosomes to the plasma membrane with PQ .

This was reﬂected in the appearance of the endocytosed inactive β 1 integrin in round endosomal looking compartments in the presence of PQ ( Figure 7D , bottom row ) . These structures were also detected in cells stained after ﬁxation with different inactive β 1 integrin antibodies ( mAb13 , 1998 , P1H5 and 4B4 ) , indicating that the formation of these endosomes was not due to the antibody chase ( Figure S6 ) . The subcellular localization of the endocytosed active β 1 integrin was slightly changed following PQ treatment , indicated by trapping to early endosomes ( Figure 7A , bottom row ) , but the amount of endocytosed active β 1 integrin was not markedly changed ( Figure 7C , D , top row ) . Unlike the inactive receptor , active β 1 integrin did not form swollen endosomes in the presence of PQ . Trafﬁc2012 ; 13 : 610 – 625 619 Arjonen et al . Inactive β 1integrinundergoesRab4 - dependent recycling In ﬁbroblasts , α V β 3 integrin has been shown to recycle back to the plasma membrane in a Rab4a - dependent manner followed by growth factor stimulation ( 10 ) . Because in our study , both β 1 integrin conformations showed clear colocalization with Rab4a ( Figure 5C ) , we tested whether dominant - negative Rab4a ( Rab4a - S22N ) would affect β 1 integrin recycling . Expression of EGFP - Rab4a - S22N increased the amount of endocytosed inactive β 1 integrins to a similar extent as PQ treatment ( Figure 7E ) . Rab4a - S22N had no effect on active β 1 integrin . These data suggest the inactive , but not the active , β 1 integrin is actively recycled back to plasma membrane via a Rab4 - dependent fast - loop pathway and thus the net endocytic rate of the inactive β 1 integrin is lower compared to the slower recycling active β 1 . Inactive β 1integrinrecyclingisdependentonactin It has been previously shown that rapid β 1 integrin recycling is an F - actin - dependent process ( 20 , 21 ) . In these studies , actin polymerization has been inhibited with the drug Cytochalasin D ( CytD ) or by overexpressing point mutated ARF6 ( Q37E / S38I ) which also inhibits the recycling of the β 1 integrin ( 20 , 21 ) . We found that PQ - induced inactive β 1 integrin endosomes signiﬁcantly overlapped with F - actin staining ( Figure 8A ) , in line with the notion of F - actin - dependent recycling endosomes . Next , we analysed the functional relationship between inactive β 1 integrin recycling and actin polymerization . We studied the effect of CytD in the localization of endocytosed β 1 integrin after PQ washout ( Figure 8B ) . As shown earlier , in non - treated cells , the inactive β 1 integrin localized predominantly to the plasma membrane , whereas the active β 1 integrin was mainly endosomally localized . PQ treatment signiﬁcantly induced accumulation of the inactive β 1 integrin inside the cells ( Figure 8B , second column , top ) . After 60 - min PQ washout , the inactive β 1 integrin was relocalized to plasma membrane protrusions ( Figure 8B , third column , top , arrowheads ) , whereas no apparent changes were detected in the localization of the active β 1 integrin . Inhibition of F - actin polymerization with CytD during PQ washout blocked the recycling of inactive β 1 integrin to the plasma membrane ( Figure 8B , last column , top ) . No obvious redistribution of the active β 1 integrin was observed after PQ washout or in CytD - treated cells . These data were validated by analysis of the level of internal β 1 integrin after PQ - induced endocytosis by quenching the cell surface ﬂuorescence . Blocking the recycling with PQ increased the total level of endocytosed inactive β 1 integrin almost twofold , whereas the difference was not signiﬁcant for active β 1 integrin ( Figure 8C ) . PQ washout restored the levels of both conformations , but inhibition of actin polymerization during PQ washout clearly inhibited the recycling of inactive β 1 integrin . CytD had no effect on active β 1 integrin recycling . This suggests that the recycling of the inactive β 1 integrin is an F - actin - dependent process . Inactive β 1integrinlocalizestoARF6 - positive protrusionsandendosomes ARF6 has been shown to localize to the plasma membrane and to regulate endosomal β 1 integrin recycling and actin polymerization ( 21 , 44 , 45 ) . In line with our data on the inactive β 1 integrin recycling being more dependent on actin polymerization , we also see increased inactive β 1 colocalization with ARF6 in protrusions , endosomes and in dorsal cell surface microspikes ( Figure 9A – C ) . Active β 1 integrin was found in the regions of ARF6 endosomes , but it did not localize to the limiting edges of ARF6 endosomes like the inactive β 1 integrin did ( Figure 9B ) . Also , active β 1 integrin was not found in ARF6 protrusions and it did not colocalize in ARF6 - positive dorsal microspikes ( Figure 9A , C ) . Closer observation of ARF6 - positive microspikes shows that the inactive β 1 integrin localizes to the tips of the microspikes ( Figure 9D and Movie S1 ) . Interestingly , these microspikes resemble greatly the actin tail comets pushing endosomes using actin polymerization for propulsion , as described by Taunton et al ( 46 ) . Taken together , our data indicate that the inactive and active β 1 integrins initially follow the same endocytosis routes and trafﬁcking pathways but have distinct trafﬁck - ing kinetics in cells ( Figure 10 ) . The active β 1 integrin is targeted to a Rab7 compartment , whereas the endocyto - sis of the inactive β 1 integrin is balanced with rapid F - actin and Rab4 - dependent recycling targeting integrins back to ARF6 - positive protrusions on the plasma membrane . In contrast , active β 1 integrin has higher net endocytosis rate as it recycles with slower kinetics . Discussion We have studied the endocytic trafﬁcking of active and inactive β 1 integrins . To the best of our knowledge , the data presented here include many previously undescribed details regarding integrin trafﬁc . We show that integrins trafﬁc with signiﬁcantly different kinetics based on their activity status . The active receptor is predominantly localized to endosomes under steady - state conditions in untreated cancer cells . In contrast , the inactive integrin is predominantly localizing to detached membrane protrusions on the plasma membrane . The distinct localizations are due to different trafﬁcking kinetics of the two receptor pools . We show that the inactive β 1 integrin trafﬁcs through a Rab4 - and actin - dependent fast - loop recycling pathway , whereas active integrin trafﬁcs predominantly along the previously described long - loop pathway ( 21 ) . These data have important implications to our understanding of integrin function in cell migration as they demonstrate a clear link between the regulation of receptor activity and the dynamic regulation of the availability of the receptor on the plasma membrane RE , recycling endosome . To date , limited data have been available on whether integrin trafﬁc is regulated differently based on the activity 620 Trafﬁc2012 ; 13 : 610 – 625 Distinct Recycling of Active and Inactive β 1 Integrins EGFP - ARF6 EGFP - ARF6 0 . 00 0 . 25 0 . 50 0 . 75 1 . 00 p = 0 . 0019 EGFP - ARF6 A B Dorsal cell surface Endosomes : 15µm ROI Merge Merge e v i t c A 1 β n i r g e t n i e v i t c an I 1 β n i r ge t n i e v i t c A 1 ß n i r ge t n i e v i t c an I 1 ß n i r ge t n i e v i t c A 1 β n i r ge t n i e v i t c an I 1 β n i r ge t n i Inactive integrin β 1 Active integrin β 1 C EGFP - ARF6 Dorsal microspikes : 5µm ROI e v i t c an I 1 β n i r ge t n i D 0 20 40 60 80 100 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 0 20 40 60 80 100 1 4 7 10 13 16 19 22 L i ne p r o f il e a l ong m i c r o s p i k e F l uo r e sc en t i n t en s i t y ( A .

Here , we describe a detection method for the different β 1 integrin pools and conformational epitopes that is based on antibody labelling of cell surface β 1 integrins . One of the major advantages of this antibody - based trafﬁcking assay is the ability to distinguish between active and inactive β 1 integrin pools and visualize the subcellular trafﬁcking without the need for harsh acid - stripping regimens .

A model of active and inactive β 1 integrin trafﬁcking . Both conformations are endocytosed clathrin and dynamin dependently to early endosomes ( EE ) and to Rab5 / Rab21 - positive endosomes where the conformer separation probably takes place . The active β 1 integrin is targeted to a Rab7 compartment , whereas the endocytosis of the inactive β 1 integrin is balanced with rapid F - actin and Rab4 - dependent recycling targeting integrins back to ARF6 - positive protrusions on the plasma membrane . The active β 1 integrin recycling is less efﬁcient , and it is currently unclear whether ligand separation or integrin inactivation is needed as a signal for active integrin recycling and reusage . Active β 1 integrin is seen in Rab4a - and Rab11 - positive compartments , but more careful studies in respect to active β 1 integrin recycling are needed . RE , recycling endosome . Here , we demonstrate that the net endocytic rate of the active β 1 integrin is higher when compared against the inactive β 1 integrin . Different recycling rates of endocytosed integrins have been attributed to changes in cell migration and invasion , co - trafﬁcking of integrins and the EGFR to the plasma membrane and induced targeting of integrins to the plasma membrane in response to hypoxia ( 47 ) . Here , we present evidence that the recycling of inactive and active β 1 integrins display distinct kinetics and that the recycling of the inactive integrin is more dependent on actin . We describe a conformer - speciﬁc inactive β 1 integrin - positive endosomal compartment that appears de novo after brief inhibition of receptor trafﬁc with PQ . These compartments are positive for F - actin , and the recycling of inactive β 1 integrin after PQ washout is dependent on actin polymerization . Owing to the faster recycling , the net endocytic rates of the inactive receptor appear lower . Interestingly , we show that the inactive integrin is rapidly returned to ARF6 - positive membrane rufﬂes and dorsal cell surface microspikes . This would be in line with the possibility that inactive integrins are preferentially targeted to actively protruding areas of the plasma membrane where they would be available to be activated and incorporated into newly forming adhesion sites ( Figure 10 ) . However , this remains to be shown . The endocytosis of both β 1 integrin conformations was dynamin and clathrin dependent . However , we cannot fully exclude the possibility of other endocytic routes . In our system , caveolin - 1 inhibition had no effect on the endocytosis . However , the role of caveolin - 1 in β 1 integrin endocytosis is most likely cell line speciﬁc as other studies clearly show that caveolin - 1 is important in the endocytosis of β 1 integrins ( 16 ) . Interestingly , our results show caveolin - 1 localizing to the rear of the motile MDA - MB - 231 cells with no colocalization with the endocytosed β 1 integrins . In contrast , colocalization is seen with clathrin and endocytosed active and inactive β 1 integrins ( Figure S5B , C ) . These observations are in line with previous studies where endocytic trafﬁcking is shown to be toward the leading lamella and caveolar endocytosis would take place in the rear ( 1 ) . Also , the observed requirement of dynamin - mediated abscission implies that the antibodies are not internalized via macropinocytosis . The generally accepted view of β 1 integrin trafﬁc is that receptors are endocytosed via different routes and trafﬁc via a Rab5 / Rab21 - positive early endosomal compartment en route to the Rab11 / ARF6 - positive recycling endosomes ( 48 , 49 ) . We see both conformations clearly colocalize with Rab5 , Rab21 , Rab4a and later to some extent with Rab11 . Exit of β 1 integrins from the early endosomes is dependent on a transient interaction between integrin α - tail and p120RasGAP which serves to displace Rab21 bound to the integrin α - tail ( 50 ) . We ﬁnd that under basal conditions , the limited number of inactive β 1 vesicles do not overlap with the active integrin . However , once the recycling of the inactive β 1 integrin is blocked , both conformations are detected in the same early endosomal compartment near the plasma membrane . This indicates that both conformations trafﬁc through the early endosomes and that the inactive integrin is diverted to a fast - recycling pathway through a yet unidentiﬁed mechanism . Supporting this , the dominant - negative Rab4a inhibits the recycling of inactive β 1 integrin but not the active β 1 integrin . The active receptors trafﬁc with slower kinetics , possibly because of the requirement for the ligand to be dissociated prior to receptor recycling . This is supported by a higher fraction of active β 1 integrin found in Rab7 - positive compartments . In conclusion , we have developed a novel method to study β 1 integrin trafﬁcking . Using this method , we have identiﬁed differences in the trafﬁcking of active and inactive β 1 integrins . In the future , it will be interesting to study integrin trafﬁcking from the point of view of the α - heterodimer since it has been suggested that the α - chains would have a role in integrin endocytic cycling ( 51 ) .

The remaining biotin at the cell surface after internalization was removed with 60 m M MesNa ( 63705 ; sodium 2 - mercaptoethanesulfonate : Fluka ) in MesNa buffer ( 50 m M Tris – HCl , pH 8 . 6 , 100 m M NaCl ) for 30min at 4 ◦ C , followed by quenching with 100 m M iodoacetamide ( Sigma ) for 15min on ice . To detect the total amount of surface biotinylation , one of the cell dishes was left on ice after biotin labelling followed by treatment without reducing MesNa . Cells were washed with PBS and in the case of recycling , the cells were incubated again at 37 ◦ C for the indicated time - points followed by reduction and quenching of the recycled biotin - labelled surface molecules as above . The cells were lysed by scraping in lysis buffer [ 1 . 5 % octylglucoside , 1 % NP - 40 , 0 . 5 % BSA , 1 m M EDTA with phosphatase and protease inhibitor coctails ( Roche ) ] and incubation at 4 ◦ C for 20min . Cell extracts were cleared by centrifugation ( 16 000 × g , 10min , 4 ◦ C ) , and the biotinylated integrins were immunoprecipitated from the supernatant with 2 ng / μ L of anti - β 1 integrin antibody ( CD29 K20 ; Custom Design Service , Beckman Coulter ) and protein G sepharose beads ( 17 - 0618 - 01 ; GE Healthcare ) . Internalized integrins were detected from immunoblots with horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) - conjugated anti - biotin antibody ( # 7075 ; Cell Signaling Technology ) , and after stripping the immunoblot , the total amount of immunoprecipitated integrinswas detected with anti - β 1 integrin antibody ( MAB2252 , Chemicon , or610468 , BDTransductionLaboratories ) . Enhancedchemiluminescence - detectedbiotinand β 1integrinsignalswere quantiﬁed as integrated densities of the protein bands with I MAGE J ( version 1 . 43u ) , and each biotin signal was normalized to the corresponding integrin signal . In the case of internalization , the relative amounts of biotin - labelled integrins inside the cell were normalized to the biotin signal of all surface labelled integrins , while in the case of recycling , the relative biotin signals were normalized to the corresponding biotin signal of all internalized integrins . The decreasing amount of biotin - labelled integrins inside the cell was inverted to represent the increase of β 1 integrin recycling . The ELISA - based endocytosis assays were performed as described above . To determine the amount of internalized , biotinylated integrins , the cell lysate was incubated in a 96 - well plate using the well - coating anti - β 1 integrin antibody K20 and an HRP - coupled anti - biotin antibody for ELISA detection .

The concentration of Alexa - conjugated secondary antibodies ( Invitrogen ) was 5 μ g / mL . Confocal 3D images were taken using Zeiss Axiovert 200M with spinning disc confocal unit Yokogawa CSU22 and Zeiss Plan - Neoﬂuar 63xOil / 1 . 4 NA objective . Z - stacks with 1 airy - unit ( approximately 0 . 7 μ m ) opticalsliceswereacquiredwithstepsizeof0 . 5 μ mbetweenslices . Image analysis and image projections were created with NIH I MAGE J . JACop plugin was used to calculate colocalizations ( 57 ) . β 1 - Integrin endocytosis was measured from mid - slice confocal images using ROI drawn inside the cell with plasma membrane as the boundary . Integrated densities were measured using I MAGE J , and the inside signals were normalized against the total ﬂuorescence signal of the same slice and cell ( ROI around the whole cell ) . Flowcytometry Cells were grown to 60 – 80 % conﬂuency and harvested with HyQTase ( HyClone ) . Cells were diluted in culture medium with 30 m M HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) . Cells were lifted on ice , and cell surface β 1 integrins were stained with primary antibody diluted 1 : 100 for 60min at 4 ◦ C , followed by counterstaining with 1 : 400 diluted Alexa Fluor 488 - conjugated secondary antibodies ( Molecular Probes ) for 60min at 4 ◦ C . The internalization and recycling assays were performed as described . Cells were analysed using BD FACSCalibur and AccuriC6 . Westernblotting Whole cell lysates were collected from nearly conﬂuent six wells of a 6 - well plate . Standard SDS sample buffer and scraping was used to lyse the cells .
