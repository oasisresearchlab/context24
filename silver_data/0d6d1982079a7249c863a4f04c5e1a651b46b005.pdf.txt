Previous data have also directly implicated one of the best supported schizophrenia - associated loci , zinc ﬁnger binding protein 804A ( ZNF804A ) , as showing trans - disorder effects , and the same is true for one of the best supported bipolar loci , calcium channel , voltage - dependent , L type , alpha 1C subunit ( CACNA1C ) which has also been associated with schizophrenia . We have undertaken a cross - phenotype study based upon the remaining variants that show genome - wide evidence for association in large schizophrenia and BD meta - analyses . These comprise in schizophrenia , SNPs in or in the vicinity of transcription factor 4 ( TCF4 ) , neurogranin ( NRGN ) and an extended region covering the MHC locus on chromosome 6 . For BD , the strongly supported variants are in the vicinity of ankyrin 3 , node of Ranvier ( ANK3 ) and polybromo - 1 ( PBRM1 ) . Using data sets entirely independent of their original discoveries , we observed strong evidence that the PBRM1 locus is also associated with schizophrenia ( P 5 0 . 00015 ) and nominally signiﬁcant evidence ( P < 0 . 05 ) that the NRGN and the extended MHC region are associated with BD . Moreover , considering this highly restricted set of loci as a group , the evidence for trans - disorder effects is compelling ( P 5 4 . 7 3 10 2 5 ) . Including earlier reported data for trans - disorder effects for ZNF804A and CACNA1C , six out of eight of the most robustly associated loci for either disorder show trans - disorder effects . INTRODUCTION For the last 100 years , psychosis occurring in the absence of an organic brain disorder has been subdivided into two cat - egories corresponding to the modern diagnostic equivalents of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder ( BD ) . At a mechanistic level , the causes of these disorders are almost completely unknown . Both are familial , and a substantial amount of the variance in risk for each disorder is genetic , twin studies revealing heritabilities for schizophrenia and BD of around 80 % or more ( 1 , 2 ) , with largely unknown environ - mental factors also being involved . Recent genetic ﬁndings , as well as ﬁndings from other areas of biomedical research , are mounting a strong challenge to the view that schizo - phrenia and BD are distinct entities ( 3 ) . Among the key ﬁnd - ings from epidemiology , a study from Sweden based upon over two million nuclear families showed risk of both dis - orders was increased in the family members of an index proband regardless of whether that proband had schizo - phrenia or BD ( 4 ) . Moreover , a recent Danish population study of the offspring of parents , one or both of whom had schizophrenia or BD , reported patterns of recurrence in those offspring suggestive of partial overlap in genetic risk for the disorders ( 5 ) . ∗ To whom correspondence should be addressed at : MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics , Henry Wellcome Building , Department of Psychological Medicine and Neurology , School of Medicine , Cardiff University , Cardiff CF14 4XN , UK .

For example , one study using gene - wide tests showed a signiﬁcant increase in the number of genes showing evidence for association to both schizophrenia and BD than would be expected by chance ( 6 ) . Highly persua - sive evidence for shared genetic risk was also provided by an analysis of schizophrenia and BD GWAS data sets by the International Schizophrenia Consortium ( 7 ) , which showed that sets of putative risk alleles deﬁned on the basis of very weak trends for association in a schizophrenia GWAS were highly signiﬁcantly , but weakly , predictive of schizophrenia in independent GWAS data sets . Moreover , the same sets of alleles were also predictive of risk for BD in two independent BD GWAS data sets . The evidence for shared risk from genetic epidemiology and global analyses of genome - wide sets of SNPs strongly sup - ports the hypothesis of shared genetic risk between schizo - phrenia and BD , but in order to start to identify shared pathophysiology , it is necessary to demonstrate overlap in risk at the level of individual alleles . Moreover , given the still limited GWAS sample sizes available ( limited in terms of power to detect speciﬁc loci ) , the strong case for shared genetic risk offers an important opportunity to derive conﬁr - matory evidence for individual loci identiﬁed as being associ - ated with schizophrenia by testing those variants in BD ( and vice versa ) . However , with the advent of large consortia in which data sets are shared , one potential pitfall of cross - phenotype analyses is that the same controls are often used in multiple studies , a fact that has the potential to result in con - vergent associations across phenotypes that reﬂect the use of overlapping controls ( 8 ) . In the present study , we have undertaken a cross - phenotype study based upon variants that show genome - wide evidence for association ( 9 ) in the largest publicly available schizo - phrenia and BD data sets . Variants that have been reported at genome - wide signiﬁcant levels for association with BD were tested in a fully independent schizophrenia GWAS data set , and the converse for variants that have been reported to be associated with schizophrenia at this level of support . In conducting these analyses , we have taken care to ensure that no samples , cases or controls , used to test the cross - disorder association overlap with samples used for the initial discovery . In doing so , our evaluations of variants are based upon smaller samples than were initially used by those reporting the associ - ation . Moreover , as discussed below , to ensure no overlap of controls , it was necessary to use different sets of controls for each analysis . RESULTS Association to the MHC region was detected at genome - wide levels of signiﬁcance through a combined analysis of three schizophrenia GWASs ( 7 , 10 , 11 ) . Although each study reported genome - wide signiﬁcant association at this extended locus ( each had meta - analysis of similar data sets ) , the study of Stefansson et al . ( 10 ) included an additional follow - up sample and as a result , attained the strongest evidence for association . That study therefore acts as the source of putative risk alleles at this locus . Spanning a wide region , the authors reported the most signiﬁcant evidence for association at rs6932590 ( Ch6 , 27 . 4 Mb , P ¼ 1 . 4 × 10 2 12 ) . They also reported association to a second locus in the region ( rs3131296 , 32 . 3 Mb , P ¼ 2 . 3 × 10 2 10 ) which was substan - tially statistically independent . Thus , we evaluated both for evidence for association to BD . For this analysis , we used the primary WTCCC GWAS BD data set ( 12 ) which had no sample overlaps with the study of schizophrenia ( 10 ) . As neither SNP was on the array , we used imputed data . Quality metrics for both SNPs indicated imputation at high quality ( RSQR ¼ 0 . 94 and 0 . 99 , respectively ) . For each locus , the associated allele reported in the source study was signiﬁcantly associated with BD , and the effect size lay within the conﬁdence interval reported in the primary study ( Table 1 ) . We also tested transcription factor 4 ( TCF4 ) in the WTCCC BD data set . The strongest schizophrenia - associated SNP ( 10 ) was rs9960767 ( Ch18 , 51 . 3 Mb ; P ¼ 4 . 1 × 10 2 9 ) , which was not on our array , but it was imputed at high quality ( RSQR ¼ 0 . 94 ) . This variant showed no evidence for association ( Table 1 ) . We also note that rs10401120 , a proxy ( r 2 ¼ 0 . 87 ) for rs9960767 used in the schizophrenia study ( 10 ) , was also not associated with BD in this sample . At neurogranin ( NRGN ) , the most strongly schizophrenia - associated SNP was rs12807809 ( Ch10 , 124 . 1 Mb ; P ¼ 2 . 4 × 10 2 9 ) ( 10 ) . Again not on the array , imputed data ( RSQR ¼ 0 . 63 ) showed signiﬁcant evidence for association ( P ¼ 0 . 02 ) in the WTCCC BD data set to the same allele and with an effect size within the conﬁdence interval of the discovery sample ( Table 1 ) . From the perspective of BD , a combined analysis of data from ﬁve GWASs ( largely BD but including schizoaffective disorder and major depressive disorder ) and data from three replication studies ( one BD , two major depressive disorders ) identiﬁed genome - wide signiﬁcant evidence at rs2251219 in PBRM1 ( Chr3 , 52 . 6 Mb , P ¼ 1 . 7 × 10 2 9 ) ( 13 ) . In our UK GWAS schizophrenia data set ( 479 cases , 2937 controls ) ( 14 ) , the same allele ( array data ) showed strong evidence for association ( P ¼ 0 . 00015 ) , with an effect size ( OR 0 . 76 ) somewhat stronger than was reported for major mood disorder , though the 95 % conﬁdence intervals were overlapping . Since the previous meta - analysis ( 13 ) included the WTCCC BD data set with which our schizophrenia sample shares controls , this evidence is not independent of the discovery . In order to test this fully independently , we used the combined non - psychiatric disorder case samples from the WTCCC . This yielded a virtually identical effect size and also a similar degree of statistical evidence for association ( Table 2 ) , con - ﬁrming that in schizophrenia , the evidence for association is entirely independent of the data originally reported . Genome - wide signiﬁcant evidence for ankyrin 3 , node of Ranvier ( ANK3 ) in BD comes from a meta - analysis of GWASs combining a total 4387 cases and 6209 controls with a maximum P - value of 9 . 1 × 10 2 9 for rs10994336 ( 15 ) . As the meta - analysis of ANK3 used the WTCCC BD data set , we used the combined non - psychiatric disorder case samples from the WTCCC to test the evidence for association in schizophrenia . We were unable to directly test rs10994336 as there are no imputed or array data available to us for this 388 Human Molecular Genetics , 2011 , Vol . 20 , No . 2 control set . However , we had data available for rs1938526 , which was also genome - wide signiﬁcant in the study of Fer - reira and colleagues ( P ¼ 1 . 3 × 10 2 8 ) . For this marker , the results were not - signiﬁcant ( P ¼ 0 . 82 ) ( Table 2 ) . As we have already published cross - disorder data on ZNF804A and calcium channel , voltage - dependent , L type , alpha 1C subunit ( CACNA1C ) across the disorders ( 16 , 17 ) , we do not represent those analyses here . DISCUSSION The present study was designed with the explicit goal of testing a very restricted number of genetic hypotheses , namely , that variants implicated at genome - wide levels of sig - niﬁcance by the largest available studies of schizophrenia are associated with susceptibility to BD , and that those similarly identiﬁed as associated with BD are associated also with schizophrenia . In contrast with much of the earlier work in this area , our own included , the genes we evaluate for cross - disorder effects have very strong prior support for involvement in one of the disorders , allowing a more secure interpretation of the relevance of the ﬁndings in the secondary phenotype . To test these hypotheses independently of the discovery data sets , we were unable to use a number of publically available data sets ( e . g . the GAIN schizophrenia and BD data sets ) as those include cases and or controls that contributed to the orig - inal discoveries . Future replication analyses will therefore require new , independent data sets for both disorders to become available . Nevertheless , at the general level , there is clear evidence for an excess of trans - disorder associations over and above chance expectations . Under the assumption of six independent tests ( allowing for two independent tests at the extended chromosome 6 locus ) , the probability for the observed distribution of trans - disorder association P - values under the null hypothesis is P ¼ 4 . 7 × 10 2 5 ( Fisher’s test for combining independent P - values , conservatively assigning values of P ¼ 1 for association to those hypothesized risk alleles where any trend for association is in the opposite direc - tion to that predicted ) . The evidence is also strong ( P ¼ 4 . 2 × 10 2 4 ) , allowing for only a single independent test of the MHC locus , that being rs6932590 for which the evidence was stron - gest in the discovery sample ( 10 ) . Thus , in aggregate , the present study provides further support for the burgeoning and increasing body of evidence that points to an overlap in genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia and BD . At the level of speciﬁc loci , we provide the ﬁrst support ( P ¼ 1 . 3 × 10 2 4 ) for the involvement in schizophrenia of variation at or around PBRM1 . Considering the level of statistical support in the original ( 13 ) and our own independent study , the evidence implicating this locus in schizophrenia and BD is now very strong . Polybromo - 1 ( PBRM1 ) encodes polybromo - 1 , a gene thatisimportantin chromatinremodelling , butgiventheextensive LDintheregion , asnotedbytheauthorsofthepreviousstudy ( 13 ) , it is not clear the signal speciﬁcally points to that gene . Thus , func - tional interpretation is premature until the source of the signal is better localized . We also provide the ﬁrst independent support for the involvement of both the MHC region and NRGN in BD , albeit at levels of signiﬁcance that are weaker than that for schizo - phrenia and the region surrounding PBRM1 . Although the levels of statistical signiﬁcance for these regions are only nominally sig - niﬁcant , and do not survive correction for multiple testing within this study , we note the enhanced prior probability for each of these as schizophrenia - associated from genome - wide studies and the overlap of conﬁdence intervals for estimated effect sizes in the two phenotypes . We , therefore , consider that our data add impor - tant evidence that those original ﬁndings represent true associ - ations , and that the loci additionally confer risk to BD . The potential implications of those ﬁndings for understanding the pathophysiology of psychosis are discussed in the original schizo - phrenia manuscripts . Noting that the functional interpretations are necessarily speculative since the true functional variants are still unknown , the associations between psychosis and the extended Table 1 .

Human Molecular Genetics , 2011 , Vol . 20 , No . 2 389 MHC locus potentially lend supportto long - heldhypotheses of the importance in psychosis of either infective agents and / or autoim - munity ( 11 ) . This support is not strong given that the association signal spans several megabases which contain large numbers of genes with no known role in immunity . Under the assumption that the association on chromosome 11 at around 124 . 1 Mb points to the gene encoding neurogranin , that ﬁnding is intriguing since it might functionally converge with the cross - disorder associations at CACNA1C ( 17 ) . Thus , CACNA1C encodes the major constituent of the brain L - type voltage - gated calcium chan - nels that are critical to dendritic calcium inﬂux ( 18 ) while neuro - granin has been proposed to act as a sensor of dendritic calcium concentration . In response to rising Ca 2 + levels , neurogranin releases calmodulin , which is then free to trigger a number of pro - cesses central to the induction of long - term potentiation and regu - lation of synaptic sensitivity ( 19 ) . Including ZNF804A and CACNA1C , the data for which have been presented elsewhere , six ( two MHC loci , ZNF804A , CACNA1C , NRGN , PBRM1 ) of eight loci that have now been implicated at genome - wide levels of signiﬁcance by large com - bined studies of either schizophrenia or BD have now been demonstrated to show at least nominally signiﬁcant trans - disorder effects , the exceptions being TCF4 ( associated so far in schizophrenia but not BD ) and ANK3 ( associated so far in BD but not schizophrenia ) . It might be argued that apparent shared effects across loci are trivially the result of the misappli - cation of diagnostic categories that are actually of fundamental biological validity , that is , trans - disorder associations simply arise because the BD samples are contaminated by schizo - phrenic cases and / or vice versa . However , given that the schizophrenia - associated alleles have similar effect sizes in BD , and vice versa ( Tables 1 and 2 ) , this would require assign - ment to the diagnostic category to be virtually random . Given that most , if not all , samples used to date in GWASs have been subjected to stringent research diagnostic criteria and prac - tices , this does not seem as plausible an explanation as the exist - ence of true overlap in genetic susceptibility . The observation that some alleles impact on both schizo - phrenia and BD does not imply the existence of a unitary con - dition ( 3 ) . For example , while it may be the case that some cross - disorder associations reﬂect alleles that cause a non - speciﬁc rise in risk of major psychiatric syndromes , others might exert effects on the function of brain networks , pertur - bation of which result in domains of psychopathology and / or alterations of behaviour that occur in subsets of people who are correctly ( under present diagnostic schemes ) assigned to the diagnostic categories schizophrenia and BD . For example , psychotic symptoms , depressed mood and altered drive and activity are frequent occurrences in people with either disorder . Therefore , if there are alleles that impact on those domains , those alleles may appear as risk factors for both disorders . It is our expectation that exploring the relation - ships between risk alleles and clinical phenotypes , for example , phenotypes that appear hybrids of both disorders such as schizoaffective disorder , psychopathological domains ( e . g . depressive symptoms , presence of psychotic features ) as well as other types of phenotypes ( e . g . cognitive and brain imaging endophenotypes ) , may ultimately lead to classi - ﬁcation systems that are quite different from those currently in place . How those will look can obviously at this point not be known ; the main point we wish to make here is that overlap in risk alleles does not imply homogeneity ; rather that current diagnostic classiﬁcations do not divide cases neatly on the basis of distinct underlying aetiologies . We also note that the underlying true proportion of suscep - tibility alleles for the individual disorders that confer risk across disorders remains to be determined . It is certainly not our contention that all genetic risk is shared across diagnostic groups ; indeed , recent family study data using very large samples indicate non - shared as well as shared genetic risk factors for schizophrenia and BD ( 4 , 5 ) , and it is possible that the currently observed high proportion may be inﬂated due to ascertainment bias in the susceptibility alleles discov - ered so far . The reasoning is that if multiple overlapping pathogenic pathways contribute to the spectrum of mood and psychotic illness , power considerations dictate that it is likely that the alleles with broadest phenotypic effect will be those discovered earliest because their detection is least sensi - tive to phenotypic variation in samples and , hence , will be well represented in most samples studied . In summary , the present study adds strong support for the hypothesis of shared genetic risk between schizophrenia and BD . We also provide evidence for the involvement of speciﬁc loci in these disorders , in particular , strong evidence for a locus in the vicinity of PBRM1 , but also support for NRGN1 and the MHC locus . Further studies will be required to identify whether these associations map on to particular clinical ( or endophenotype ) variables that might usefully be used to clas - sify these disorders on more aetiologically relevant grounds . MATERIALS AND METHODS Tested variants In order to rigorously test the hypothesis of trans - disorder , we restricted our analysis to variants which have strong prior evidence for association to one or other disorder . Thus , we only tested variants that surpass a widely accepted bench - mark for genome - wide signiﬁcance ( P ≤ 7 . 2 × 10 2 8 ) ( 9 ) in large meta - analyses . These comprise in schizophrenia , SNPs in or in the vicinity of zinc ﬁnger binding protein 804A ( ZNF804A ) ( 16 ) , TCF4 ( 10 ) , NRGN ( 10 ) and an extended region covering the MHC locus on chromosome 6 ( 7 , 10 , 11 ) . For BD , the strongly supported variants are in or in the vicinity of CACNA1C ( 15 ) , ANK3 ( 15 ) and PBRM1 , the latter showing genome - wide support in a composite phenotype of BD , schi - zoaffective disorder and major depressive disorder ( 13 ) . Cross - disorder analyses involving the samples included in the present study already support evidence for association for ZNF804A and CACNA1C across the disorders ( 16 , 17 ) . GWAS data sets Full details of the GWAS samples ( all white and of UK origin ) and the conduct of the GWAS analyses are fully described in the primary schizophrenia ( 14 ) and BD ( 12 ) manuscripts . Since both primary GWASs exploited the same sets of controls , where the sourced evidence for association included one of the UK GWAS samples , it was necessary to use an alterna - tive control data set for the present analysis to ensure the 390 Human Molecular Genetics , 2011 , Vol . 20 , No . 2 cross - disorder test was fully independent of the discovery . To achieve this , we adopted an approach reported by the WTCCC ( 12 ) in which a ‘control’ population was derived by combining the data from the six other ( non - psychiatric disorder ) case samples used in that study , all of which were genotyped contem - poraneously using the same pipeline as our primary GWAS data sets . Although these samples were not screened for presence of psychiatric illness , this does not have an appreciable effect on the outcome of association analyses when the rate of the disorder in the general population is low ( 8 ) . These six case samples gave a total sample size of 11 374 subjects . Imputation Genome - wide imputation was performed using Mach 1 . 0 ( 20 ) with the 1000 genomes - Sanger 2009 - 08 data release ( http : / / www . sph . umich . edu / csg / yli / mach / download / 1000G - Sanger - 0908 . html ) as the reference source for the variants to be imputed . That sourcecomprisesthevariationderivedfrom112haploidgenomesandcontainsovereightmillionSNPs . Following the authors rec - ommendations ( http : / / www . sph . umich . edu / csg / yli / mach / tour / imputation . html ) , Step 1 of the imputation process was based on a subset of 450 individuals ( 150 BD subjects , 150 schizo - phrenia subjects and 150 controls selected at random from our data sets ) from which the sample recombination parameters were derived for use in imputing the whole sample , therefore removing the chance that one data set could bias the imputation parameters . Also , following the guidelines , only SNPs with an RSQR above 0 . 3 were retained . Tests for association were with a likelihood ratio test using mach2dat ( 21 ) . Note that imputed data were not available for the ‘controls’ derived from the six sets of non - psychiatric disorder cases reported by the WTCCC .
