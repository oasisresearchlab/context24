Numerical simulations carried out in three dimensions allow us to explore the microscopic partitioning of stresses and strains between the stiff and ﬂoppy fractions c s and c f and reveal a nontrivial relationship between the mechanical behavior and the relative fraction of stiff polymer : when there are few stiff polymers , nonpercolated stiff ‘‘inclusions‘‘ are protected from large deformations by an encompassing ﬂoppy matrix , while at higher fractions of stiff material the stiff network is independently percolated and dominates the mechanical response .

The mechanical properties of these biomaterials are biologically highly signiﬁcant [ 1 , 2 ] . Understanding these properties at the bulk or continuous level is not sufﬁcient : biological entities such as cells , motor proteins , and sensory complexes experience , manipulate , and inter - act with these polymer networks at single - ﬁlament length scales and are therefore intimately aware of the discrete nature of these materials . Another complication arises when considering that most structural biomaterials are in fact composites : bidisperse or polydisperse mixtures of different protein polymers . The extracellular matrix con - sists of a mixture of stiff collagen and ﬂexible elastin ﬁlament ( bundles ) , and the relative abundance of these two greatly affects mechanical properties [ 3 ] . A more speciﬁc example that derives much of its biological func - tion from the side - by - side deployment of mechanically vastly different ﬁlaments is articular cartilage—a complex , partially ordered composite containing type - II collagen and proteoglycans as its main structural components [ 4 ] . Composite physics may be at play in single - component networks : coexistent and interlinked single ﬁbers and ﬁber bundles determine the mechanical properties of actin gels and actin - ﬁlamin networks [ 5 ] . The interplay between stiff and ﬂoppy elements goes far beyond simple property mix - ing , as demonstrated by yet another striking example of a composite network : the cytoskeleton . The network of rela - tively ﬂoppy ﬁlamentous actin ( F - actin ) and intermediate ﬁlaments is believed to be nonlinearly stiffened by the rigid microtubules , and experiments have hinted at signiﬁcant tensional forces in the cellular actin [ 6 , 7 ] . The cell cytos - keleton , which is built up from microtubules , actin ﬁlaments , and intermediate ﬁlaments , is yet another strik - ing example of a composite network . Signiﬁcant effort has been devoted to model systems of homogeneous and isotropic single - component networks of biopolymers , such as F - actin and collagen [ 8 – 16 ] . The single ﬁlaments that constitute these networks can be de - scribed by the semiﬂexible wormlike chain force - extension curve , where extension requires that thermal ﬂuctuations of the ﬁlaments be suppressed leading to a steep and non - linear increase in the force . Compression requires consid - erably smaller forces that become constant in the Euler buckling limit [ 8 , 9 ] . Networks of such ﬁlaments show highly nonlinear strain stiffening and negative normal forces under shear [ 10 , 11 ] . Recent theoretical studies and simulations have also underlined the importance of non - afﬁne bending deformations in these networks [ 12 , 14 – 16 ] . Models applying a similar method to composite biomate - rials have only recently begun to emerge [ 17 , 18 ] and have focused on bulk behavior . In this Letter , we report the results of a series of numeri - cal experiments of two - component networks of biopoly - mers to determine the relationship between composition and mechanical properties , both on the single ﬁlament as well as on the bulk level . Furthermore , we compare our results to a theoretical model . Our networks consist of long ﬁlaments that are perma - nently cross - linked . These cross - links force a binary bond between two ﬁlaments , without angular preferences . The ﬁlaments are described by the semiﬂexible wormlike chain model [ 8 , 9 ] . The degrees of freedom of the segments ( parts of ﬁlaments in between two cross - links ) are inte - grated out to obtain an effective Hamiltonian . This effec - tive Hamiltonian gives the energy for each network PRL 105 , 118101 ( 2010 ) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending 10 SEPTEMBER 2010 0031 - 9007 = 10 = 105 ( 11 ) = 118101 ( 4 ) 118101 - 1 (cid:1) 2010 The American Physical Society conﬁguration , characterized by the network topology , the positions of the cross - links , and the link - to - link separation of the ﬁlaments between cross - links . Starting from a ran - dom , isotropic network consisting of cross - links and seg - ments , we apply a large number of Monte Carlo moves which alter the network topology such that ﬁlaments with a persistent directionality along segments are formed . At this point , we designate ﬁlaments to be either stiff or ﬂoppy by assigning to each segment a persistence length and an equilibrium backbone length . We then further relax the conﬁguration by applying new Monte Carlo moves . All our networks have periodic boundary conditions and con - tain 1000 cross - links . Their lateral sizes are determined by the condition of zero pressure . A detailed description of this approach is presented in [ 14 ] . Our networks are char - acterized by the following set of parameters : the persis - tence length ‘ p of the stiff ﬁlaments , the stiffness ratio R p ¼ ‘ p = ‘ p ; floppy , the average ﬁlament length L , the aver - age distance between cross - links along a polymer’s back - bone ‘ c , and ﬁnally the relative fraction of stiff ﬁlaments c s . In this work , we examine the c s dependence of the mechanical behavior . We restrict ourselves to a biologi - cally relevant region of parameter space : the persistence length ‘ p ; floppy of the ﬂoppy ﬁlaments and the cross - link distance ‘ c are of comparable magnitude . On average , each ﬁlament is cross - linked 6 times ( L ¼ 6 l c ) . The ratio of the persistence lengths of stiff and ﬂoppy ﬁlaments R p is chosen to be 16 or 64 . While this ratio is smaller than that for collagen and elastin composites ( R p (cid:2) 100 ) [ 3 ] , or microtubule and F - actin composites ( R p > 200 ) [ 19 ] , it is large enough to capture the qualitative behavior of such composite networks . Unless otherwise stated , all data shown represent the averages of nine network realizations . Our key ﬁndings are summarized in Fig . 1 . In Fig . 1 ( a ) we plot a 50 = 50 composite : rather than averaged , the mechanical behavior is bimodal—approaching the fully ﬂoppy system at low strains but , at ﬁnite strains , resem - bling the fully stiff network . We stress that this type of response can only be achieved in a composite . Even the linear behavior does not interpolate simply between stiff and ﬂoppy : Fig . 1 ( b ) shows that at low to intermediate c s , the modulus is quite insensitive to c s , but rises very quickly at higher c s . Figure 1 ( c ) , ﬁnally , reinforces the point of Fig . 1 ( a ) : although the effects of adding stiff polymer are hardly noticeable in the linear elastic behavior , their effect on the nonlinear behavior is felt much earlier . The critical strain ( (cid:1) c ) for the onset of the nonlinear regime reacts immediately to the addition of stiff material , but saturates at a point roughly coincident with the rise of the linear modulus . The qualitative picture that emerges at small c s is one of a ﬂoppy matrix encompassing isolated stiff ﬁlaments , or nonpercolated clusters . Intuitively , the initial insensitivity of the linear modulus K 0 to the addition of stiff material makes sense : deforming the stiff ﬁlaments requires higher energies than deforming the softer elements , and therefore the low - energy modes of the system favor straining the ﬂoppy elements over the stiff ones . As long as stiff ﬁla - ments do not form an independently load - bearing subnet - work , these low - energy modes exist and are compatible with the bulk deformation . This interpretation is conﬁrmed by an examination of the microscopic deformation ﬁeld , characterized by the nonafﬁnity parameter A ¼ hj x aff (cid:1) x j 2 i = (cid:1) 2 [ Fig . 2 ( a ) ] . This parameter quantiﬁes the deviation of the local defor - mations , x , from a homogeneous afﬁne deformation ﬁeld , x aff . As shown in previous numerical work [ 16 ] and in experiments [ 20 ] , the nonafﬁnity generally increases with increased stiffness of the ﬁlaments , as bending deforma - tions are more important for the network response of stiffer ﬁlaments . Indeed we ﬁnd that the nonafﬁnity is minimal 50 100 150 200 250 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 0 50 100 150 200 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 0 . 16 0 . 20 0 . 24 0 . 28 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 0 FIG . 1 ( color online ) .

Such a linear increase repre - sents the generic behavior of low - density ( stiff ) inclusions that independently perturb the deformation ﬁeld of their surrounding ( ﬂoppy ) matrix [ 21 ] . These additional non - afﬁne deformations bring the ﬂoppy ﬁlaments closer to the nonlinear part of their force - extension relation , giving rise to the decrease of the critical strain (cid:1) c as displayed in Fig . 1 ( c ) . In the nonlinear regime the inherent stiffening of a single semiﬂexible polymer makes the distinction between ﬂoppy and stiff fractions highly strain dependent , with the ratio of their nonlinear moduli tending to unity in the high strain limit . This suggests a self - matching behavior at ﬁnite strain : the ﬂoppy network stiffens up to the point where its modu - lus matches that of the stiff network . Beyond this point , the entire meshwork behaves as a nearly monodisperse system of stiff ﬁlaments . This effect is the origin of the behavior in Fig . 1 ( a ) : at high strains , the entire system is ultimately forced to couple to the stiffer deformation modes . This mechanism of stiffness matching is further illus - trated in Fig . 2 ( b ) , which shows the average forces in the stiff and ﬂoppy ﬁlaments during deformation . By compar - ing with the one - component networks ( gray lines ) , we can deﬁne a strain shift (cid:2)(cid:1) : For given network strain (cid:1) , the ﬁlaments in the composite behave as if they were strained up to (cid:1) þ (cid:2)(cid:1) . Apparently , the effective strain on the ﬂoppy ﬁlaments is much larger than that on the stiff ﬁlaments . Equivalently , high forces in stiff ﬁlaments are suppressed , at the cost of increased forces in ﬂoppy ﬁlaments . Interestingly , this load partitioning persists even at zero strain , where stiff ﬁlaments are , on average , compressed while ﬂoppy ﬁlaments are stretched out . This simulta - neously stretched and compressed ground state is tantaliz - ingly reminiscent of tensegrity states [ 7 ] . Apparently , dense cross - linking restricts relaxation of the network , and the absolute minimum of mechanical energy cannot be attained . There is , therefore , always a ﬁnite amount of residual elastic energy . This suggests that such force dis - tributions may not be a deliberate design principle but rather are the necessary by - product of polydispersity in ﬁlamentous composites . The picture of a ﬂoppy matrix embedding stiffer inclu - sions breaks down when the stiff ﬁlaments become inde - pendently rigidity percolated : the point where deformation of the stiff elements becomes inevitable . We may estimate the percolation threshold by a counting argument [ 22 ] . Equating the number of degrees of freedom of the stiff ﬁlaments to the number of constraints due to cross - links between stiff ﬁlaments gives ( for L = ‘ c ¼ 6 ) a threshold c s ¼ 0 : 56 . This marks the transition from the low to the high c s regime and coincides roughly with the rise in the linear modulus K 0 [ Fig . 1 ( b ) ] . Two separate observa - tions conﬁrm the onset of stiff dominance : First , c s ¼ 0 : 56 is the point at which the nonafﬁnity , which we attribute to the ﬂoppy matrix attempting to work around the stiff frac - tion , begins to plateau at the level of the bending dominated response of a purely stiff network . Second , the critical strain (cid:1) c levels off around this same value of c s . In the range of stiffness ratios ( R p ) accessible to the simulations , the per - colation is rather ‘‘soft’’ and represents a smooth crossover phenomenon . The approach towards the singular percola - tion limit , R p ¼ 1 , has , for example , been studied in simulations of mixed random resistor networks [ 23 ] . To address the analogous problem we compare our results with theoretical considerations , in which the parameter R p can be tuned to arbitrarily large values . The ‘‘ﬂoppy - mode’’ theory [ 12 ] has recently been shown to capture quite well the elasticity in one - component isotropic [ 24 , 25 ] as well as anisotropic networks [ 26 ] . Within this theoretical frame - work the calculation of the network elastic modulus is reduced to the description of a ‘‘test’’ ﬁlament in an array of pinning sites . The coupling strength to these sites , k , represents the elastic modulus of the network and has to be 0 1 2 - 0 . 2 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 2 3 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 FIG . 2 ( color online ) .

To generalize this model to the case of composite networks , we use two different test chains with coupling parameters k f and k s , representing ﬂoppy and stiff ﬁlaments , respectively [ 27 ] . The use of two different coupling strengths quite naturally takes into ac - count the load partitioning encountered in the simulations . The network modulus , k ¼ c s k s þ ð 1 (cid:1) c s Þ k f , is obtained by solving the two equations k f = s ’ (cid:1) min y (cid:2) W f = s b ½ y ð s Þ(cid:3) þ 1 2 X n i ¼ 1 k (cid:3) i ð y ð s i Þ (cid:1) (cid:1) y i Þ 2 (cid:3)(cid:4) ; ( 1 ) where k (cid:3) i ¼ k s ; k f with probability c s and 1 (cid:1) c s , respec - tively . The two energy contributions on the right - hand side of Eq . ( 1 ) reﬂect the competition between the bending energy of the ( ﬂoppy or stiff ) ﬁlament , W f = s b , and the energy due to deformation of the surrounding medium by displac - ing the pinning sites ( located at arclength position s i along the ﬁlament ) . The nonlinear entropic stretching elasticity is not included in these equations . The minimization is to be performed over the contour of the ﬁlament , y ð s Þ , the angular brackets specify the disorder average over the network structure . Figure 2 ( c ) displays the results from this calculation for various stiffness ratios R p , showing a sharp percolation transition in the limit R p ! 1 . The model compares well with the simulation data , even though the stretching elas - ticity is not accounted for . This indicates that the bending stiffness is likely the dominant factor in determining the rise of the linear elastic modulus , in agreement with the proposed mechanism of load partitioning and the observed increase of the nonafﬁnity . In conclusion , our results demonstrate that the mechani - cal behavior of ﬁlamentous composites is considerably richer than the simple proportional mixing of properties . The fact that the ﬂoppy and stiff networks are physically linked causes a strongly nonlinear coupling between the strain ﬁelds which deeply affects composite mechanics . This may explain the ubiquity of composites in structural biological applications : slight variations in composition cause large changes in mechanical behavior . This high susceptibility makes the composite architecture an attrac - tive motif for biological regulation . Likewise , the ‘‘best of both worlds‘‘ aspect may be exploited by nature : compo - sites combine the initial softness of their most compliant components with the ultimate toughness of the stiffest elements . This greatly enhances the stiffness range of non - linearly elastic materials . Moreover , composites do so in a manner that could never be attained in monodisperse ma - terials , since linear and nonlinear properties of composites are determined by two physically different materials and therefore may be independently varied . This possibility of independently tuning the linear and nonlinear behavior also has considerable potential for the design of biomi - metic or bioinspired synthetic materials and deserves fur - ther exploration .
