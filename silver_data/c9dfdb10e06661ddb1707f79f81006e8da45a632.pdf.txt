How these sheets develop and withstand three - dimensional deformations has remained unclear . Here we combine measurements of epithelial tension and shape with theoretical modelling to show that epithelial sheets are active superelastic materials . We produce arrays of epithelial domes with controlled geometry . Quantification of luminal pressure and epithelial tension reveals a tensional plateau over several - fold areal strains . These extreme strains in the tissue are accommodated by highly heterogeneous strains at a cellular level , in seeming contradiction to the measured tensional uniformity . This phenomenon is reminiscent of superelasticity , a behaviour that is generally attributed to microscopic material instabilities in metal alloys . We show that in epithelial cells this instability is triggered by a stretch - induced dilution of the actin cortex , and is rescued by the intermediate filament network . Our study reveals a type of mechanical behaviour—which we term active superelasticity—that enables epithelial sheets to sustain extreme stretching under constant tension . Epithelial tissues enable key physiological functions , including mor - phogenesis , transport , secretion and absorption 1 . To perform these functions , epithelia often adopt a three - dimensional ( 3D ) architec - ture that consists of a curved cellular sheet enclosing a pressurized fluid - filled lumen 2 , 3 . The loss of this 3D architecture is associated with developmental defects , inflammatory conditions and cancer 4 , 5 . The acquisition of a 3D shape by epithelial sheets requires a tight control of cellular deformation , mechanical stress and luminal pres - sure . How these mechanical variables are tuned together to sculpt 3D epithelia is unknown , because current techniques to map epithelial mechanics are largely restricted to two - dimensional ( 2D ) layers seeded on a flat substrate 6 , 7 or freely standing between cantilevers 5 . Here we report direct measurements of traction , tension , pressure and defor - mation in 3D epithelial monolayers of controlled size and shape . These measurements establish that epithelial monolayers exhibit active super - elasticity , an unanticipated mechanical behaviour that enables extreme deformations at nearly constant tension . Micropatterned epithelial domes We used transmural pressure as the morphogenetic driving force to shape epithelial monolayers in 3D . We seeded Madin - Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cells on a soft polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) substrate that was homogeneously coated with fibronectin except for micropat - terned , non - adhesive areas of precise geometry ( Fig . 1a ) . A few hours after seeding , cells covered the adherent regions of the gel , and with time they invaded the non - adherent areas 8 , 9 . Because MDCK cells are known to actively pump osmolites in the apico - basal direction 10 , 11 , we reasoned that fluid pressure should build up in the interstitial space between cells and the impermeable substrate , which would lead to tissue delamination from the substrate in the non - adherent regions . Consistent with this rationale , we observed the spontaneous formation of multicellular epithelial domes that closely followed micropatterned shapes , such as circles , rectangles and stars ( Fig . 1b – e , Extended Data Fig . 1a – d ) . In contrast to spontaneous doming by delamination 10 , 11 , our control of the dome footprint gave us access to large variations in the dome aspect ratio ( Fig . 1c – e ) . Measurement of dome mechanics To measure dome mechanics , we focused on circular patterns and implemented 3D traction microscopy to determine the three compo - nents of tractions at the surface of the PDMS substrate ( Fig . 2a , b ) . Tractions in adherent regions showed large fluctuations without a clear spatial pattern ( Fig . 2b ) . By contrast , non - adherent areas exhibited sys - tematic normal and nearly uniform negative tractions that indented the substrate . In a narrow annular region at the margin of the dome footprint , the traction vector consistently exhibited a positive normal component that pulled the substrate upward . These observations— along with the morphology of the domes—established that the lumen was in a state of hydrostatic pressure , and that the free - standing part of the monolayer sustained tension to balance this pressure ( Fig . 2a ) . We then wondered whether we could map the tensional state of the dome , even though constituent cells did not directly generate tractions on the substrate . Epithelial domes followed a spherical cap geometry very closely ( Fig . 2b ) , which implies that their surface tension ( σ ) was isotropic , uniform and obeyed Laplace’s law ( 2 σ = R × Δ P , where Δ P is the transmural pressure and R the radius of curvature of the dome ; see Supplementary Note 1 ) . This equation enabled us to meas - ure the epithelial tension of the domes , as the normal traction in the non - adherent regions provides a direct readout of Δ P and R could be measured from confocal stacks . We found tissue tensions in the millinewton per metre range , similar to previous measurements in 2D monolayers 5 , 7 . To test the principle behind our tension measurement , we perturbed the system with the Rho kinase inhibitor Y - 27632 , which is known to reduce tissue tension . Because the epithelial barrier has finite perme - ability to water , the enclosed volume—and hence R —cannot change 1 Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia ( IBEC ) , The Barcelona Institute for Science and Technology ( BIST ) , Barcelona , Spain . 2 LaCàN , Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya - BarcelonaTech , Barcelona , Spain . 3 INM - Leibniz Institut für Neue Materialien , Saarbrücken , Germany . 4 Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red en Bioingeniería , Biomateriales y Nanomedicina , Barcelona , Spain . 5 Chemistry Department , Saarland University , Saarbrücken , Germany . 6 CNRS UMR 7592 , Institut Jacques Monod ( IJM ) , Université Paris Diderot , Paris , France . 7 Mechanobiology Institute ( MBI ) , National University of Singapore , Singapore , Singapore . 8 Unitat de Biofísica i Bioenginyeria , Universitat de Barcelona , Barcelona , Spain . 9 Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats ( ICREA ) , Barcelona , Spain . * e - mail : marino . arroyo @ upc . edu ; xtrepat @ ibecbarcelona . eu 8 N O V e M B e r 2 0 1 8 | V O l 5 6 3 | N At U r e | 2 0 3 © 2018 Springer Nature Limited .

This prediction was confirmed by our measurements ( Fig . 2c – g , Extended Data Fig . 2a – c , Supplementary Video 1 ) . We also examined water trans - port by subjecting domes to hyper - osmotic shocks ( Supplementary Note 2 ) . Volume dynamics under osmotic perturbations were consist - ent with a simple physical picture in which the epithelium behaves in a manner similar to a semi - permeable membrane actively pumping osmolites at nearly constant rate . Constitutive relation between dome tension and strain In the absence of pharmacological or osmotic perturbations and over timescales of hours , epithelial domes exhibited large volume fluctu - ations ( Fig . 3a , Supplementary Video 2 ) . These fluctuations involved periods of slow swelling and de - swelling combined with sudden vol - ume drops , often up to total dome collapse and subsequent rebirth . The magnitude of collapse events , presumably caused by localized disruptions of epithelial integrity , and the duration of swelling phases exhibited high variability ( Fig . 3a , b , Extended Data Fig . 3 ) . During these spontaneous fluctuations , we tracked luminal pressure and dome geometry , which provided a measurement of epithelial tension at different degrees of swelling ( Fig . 3c – e , Supplementary Video 2 ) . To examine these data , we represented tension in the free - standing tissue as a function of nominal areal strain of the dome ε d = ( h / a ) 2 , which is defined as the difference between the actual area of the dome π ( h 2 + a 2 ) and the area of the non - adhesive region π a 2 , normalized by the latter ( see Fig . 2b for a definition of h and a ) . All domes exhib - ited tensions of about 1 mN m − 1 at small strains . At moderate strains ( below 100 % ) , tension progressively increased according to a highly reproducible law . Beyond this point , tension exhibited larger scatter but reached a plateau at about 2 mN m − 1 for areal strains up to 300 % ( Fig . 3e , Extended Data Fig . 4a ) . The existence of this plateau is nota - ble , as it reveals that epithelial domes maintain tensional homeosta - sis while undergoing deformations that change their area by up to fourfold . Human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma ( Caco - 2 ) cells showed a plateau at similar tension but lower strain ( Extended Data Fig . 4b , c ; see Supplementary Table 1 for a list of cell lines known to form domes ) . A number of mechanisms could contribute to such tensional homeo - stasis , including directed 12 or accelerated 13 cell division , junctional network rearrangements 14 , and cell exchange between domes and the adjacent adhered tissue . Visual examination of the domes showed that cell division and extrusion were rare ( Supplementary Videos 3 , 4 ) . Moreover , the number of cells in the dome remained constant during the several - fold increases in dome area ( Extended Data Fig . 1f ) .

All rights reserved . Article reSeArcH We thus concluded that the tension – strain response of the tissue had to depend on the mechanics of cell stretching . To understand the tension – strain relation of the dome monolayer , we developed a theoretical vertex model in 3D 15 , 16 . The model is based on the well - established observation that the major determi - nant of epithelial - cell mechanics is the actin cortex 17 . In the timescales of our experiments , this thin cytoskeletal network behaves in a manner similar to a fluid gel , and is capable of developing contractile tension owing to myosin motors 17 . In 3D vertex models , these active tensions act along lateral ( γ l ) and apico - basal ( γ ab ) faces of pol - yhedral cells ( Fig . 3g , Supplementary Note 3 ) . Assuming constant cell volume 5 and idealizing cells as regular hexagonal prisms of uniform thickness under uniform equibiaxial strain , this model predicts that the effective surface tension of the tissue depends on cellular areal strain ε c as σ γ γ ε = − + / k ( 1 ) ( 1 ) ab l c 3 2 where k is a non - dimensional constant . This active constitutive relation recapitulates the initial increase in tension and the subsequent plateau at larger areal strain that are observed experimentally ( Fig . 3e , f ) . The tendency of tension to plateau at large strains emerges naturally from the fact that the area of lateral faces decreases with cell stretching and , hence , tissue tension converges to apico - basal tension . To theoretically examine tissue stretching by dome swelling , we developed a compu - tational version of the vertex model shown in Fig . 3g ( Supplementary Note 3 ) . The tension – strain law evaluated using this computational approach closely matched the analytical constitutive relation in equa - tion ( 1 ) ( Fig . 3f ) . Although this simple theoretical framework captured the tension – strain relationship , it missed a notable experimental feature : during swelling and de - swelling , we systematically observed cells that barely changed area coexisting with cells that reached cellular areal strains of up to 1 , 000 % , which is five times greater than the average dome strain ( Fig . 4a , b , Extended Data Fig . 5a – e , Supplementary Videos 5 – 7 ) . This extreme heterogeneity in strain is reminiscent of that observed in highly stretched epithelia in vivo , such as the trophoblast in human and mouse blastocysts 18 , 19 ( Extended Data Fig . 5f , g ) . In both epithelial domes and blastocysts , strain heterogeneity would seem to be in contradiction with their spherical shape , which implies tensional uniformity . The heterogeneity of cellular strain increased sharply beyond areal strains of approximately 100 % ( Fig . 4a , Extended Data Fig . 5 ) . This strain threshold coincides with the onset of the tensional plateau and with the increase in the scatter of tissue tension ( Fig . 3e ) . Epithelial domes exhibit superelastic behaviour Taken together , our experiments show that epithelial domes exhibit large reversible deformations and a tensional plateau during which superstretched constitutive elements coexist with barely stretched ones . These uncommon material features are defining hallmarks of superelasticity , a behaviour that is observed in some inert materials such as nickel – titanium alloys 20 . These materials are able to undergo large and reversible deformations at constant stress by heterogeneously switching between low - and high - strain phases 20 . The microscopic trigger of superelasticity is a mechanical instability that results from a decreasing branch in the stress – strain relation of the material ( strain softening ) . We reasoned that , by analogy with this behaviour , cell monolayers might behave as superelastic materials by switching from barely stretched to superstretched cellular states at constant tension .

Article reSeArcH To explore this possibility further , we sought a strain - softening mech - anism that would explain the mechanical instability that underlies the transition between low - and high - strain phases . Because cellular deformations increased the surface area of the actin cortex by over threefold , we hypothesized that strain softening arose from the limited availability of cytoskeletal components 21 . Scarcity of cytoskeletal components could lead to stretch - induced cortical dilution , which could impair the ability of the cortex to generate active tension 22 ( Supplementary Note 3 ) . To test this hypothesis , we incorporated cor - tical dynamics in the 3D vertex model . We focused on actin as the main cortical component , although cortical depletion could also affect actin cross - linkers , polymerization agents and molecular motors . In our model , cortical thickness—or , equivalently , cortical surface density ρ —is determined by a balance between polymerization at the plasma membrane and depolymerization in the bulk of the actin gel 23 . If the availability of cytoskeleton components ready for polymerization is infinite , this model predicts that cortical density ρ , and hence corti - cal tension γ , are constant and independent of strain , which leads to equation ( 1 ) . However , if free cytoskeleton components are limited , the model predicts a progressive depletion of cortical density ρ with cellular areal strain—and hence strain softening when the cortex becomes sufficiently thin 22 ( Fig . 4c ) . To test this physical mechanism , we measured cortical surface density ρ in cells located at the apex of fixed domes and represented this surface density as a function of cell strain ε c . These experiments showed that superstretched cells system - atically exhibited less - dense cortices ( Fig . 4d – g , Extended Data Fig . 6 ) . Moreover , live imaging of cells labelled with SiR – actin showed that the actin cortex became progressively and reversibly diluted with cell stretching ( Fig . 4h – j , Supplementary Video 8 ) . We exogenously interfered with cell – cell junctions and the actin cytoskeleton ( Extended Data Figs . 2 , 7 ) . Notably , we locally triggered actin depolymerization using a photoactivatable derivative of cytoch - alasin D . Upon activation , targeted cells increased their area without noticeable changes in the overall shape of the dome ( Extended Data Fig . 8 , Supplementary Video 9 ) , which indicates that cortical dilution is sufficient to cause large increases in cell area . Taken together , these results are consistent with our hypothesis that cortical dilution under - lies cellular superstretching . Besides strain softening , superelasticity also requires re - stiffening at large strains to confine the high - strain phase . Without such a mech - anism , the first cell to reach the softening regime would easily deform further , relaxing neighbouring cells and eventually localizing deforma - tion in an unbounded fashion 24 ( Supplementary Note 3 , Supplementary Video 10 ) . Multiple mechanisms could stiffen cells that are subjected to extreme stretching , including exhaustion of the plasma membrane reservoir 25 , crowding of adhesion molecules in shrinking cell – cell adhesions 26 , confinement of the nucleus between tensed cortices or load transfer to the otherwise - relaxed intermediate filament cytoskel - eton 5 . Our experiments do not rule out any of these possibilities but do provide support for the last . Indeed , intermediate filaments in super - stretched cells appeared unusually straight , which suggests that these filaments are load - bearing ( Fig . 4l – n , Extended Data Fig . 9 ) . To fur - ther test this mechanism , we laser - ablated keratin - 18 filaments . In weakly stretched cells , laser ablation did not induce changes in cell area . By contrast , laser ablation in superstretched cells resulted in a rapid increase in cell area , indicating that intermediate filaments in superstretched cells—but not in relaxed cells—bear tension ( Fig . 4o , p , Extended Data Fig . 10 ) . By introducing re - stiffening at large strains into our computational vertex model , we were able to recapitulate our most - salient experimental observations ( Supplementary Videos 11 , 12 ) . At low levels of dome stretching , tissue tension increased with strain , and heterogeneity in cellular strain was low ( Fig . 4k , q , r ) . By contrast , at high levels of stretching , the domes reached a tensional plateau and heterogeneity in cellular strain rose sharply . Thus , strain softening by stretch - induced depletion of cortical components followed by re - stiffening at extreme stretches configures an effective bistable energy landscape of active origin that explains the emergence of a stable high - strain phase of superstretched cells under sufficiently large ten - sion ( Fig . 4r , Supplementary Note 3 ) . Active superelasticity provides a mechanism for epithelial tissues to undergo extreme and reversible deformations at nearly constant tension by progressive switching of individual cells to a superstretched state . Our study suggests that , because the underlying subcellular mecha - nisms are generic , superelasticity may have a broad applicability in vivo . For example , epithelial superelasticity may mediate the spreading of superstretched extra - embryonic tissues and their subsequent rapid compaction 27 . Active superelasticity may also enable extreme cellu - lar strains in the trophectoderm during the swelling and hatching of mammalian blastocysts 18 , 19 . Besides providing a framework to under - stand epithelial mechanics and morphogenesis in vivo , the material laws established here set the stage for a rational manipulation of cell monolayers in organoids and organ - on - a - chip technologies 28 .

The experiments were not randomized and investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment . Fabrication of soft silicone gels . Soft elastomeric silicone gels were prepared using a protocol based on previous publications 29 – 32 . In brief , a silicone elastomer was synthesized by mixing a 1 : 1 weight ratio of CY52 - 276A and CY52 - 276B poly - dimethylsiloxane ( Dow Corning Toray ) . After degassing for 5 min , the gel was spin - coated on glass - bottom dishes ( 35 - mm , no . 0 coverslip thickness , Mattek ) for 90 s at 400 r . p . m . The samples were then cured at 80 °C for 1 h . The substrates were kept in a clean , dust - free and dry environment and they were always used within 4 weeks of fabrication . Coating the soft PDMS substrate with fluorescent beads . After curing , the soft PDMS was treated with ( 3 - aminopropyl ) triethoxysilane ( APTES , Sigma - Aldrich , cat . no . A3648 ) diluted at 5 % in absolute ethanol for 3 min , rinsed 3 times with ethanol 96 % , and dried in the oven for 30 min at 60 °C . Samples were incubated for 5 min with a filtered ( 220 nm ) and sonicated solution of 200 - nm - diameter red fluorescent carboxylate - modified beads ( FluoSpheres , Invitrogen ) in sodium tetraborate ( 3 . 8 mg / ml , Sigma - Aldrich ) , boric acid ( 5 mg / ml , Sigma - Aldrich ) and 1 - ethyl - 3 - ( 3 - dimethylaminopropyl ) carbodiimide ( EDC , 0 . 1 mg / ml , Sigma - Aldrich ) , as previously described 29 . Next , gels were rinsed 3 times with type - 1 water and dried in the oven for 15 min at 60 °C . Beads were passivated by incubating the samples with tris - buffered saline ( TBS , Sigma - Aldrich ) solution for 20 min at room temperature . Finally , substrates were rinsed again 3 times with type - 1 water and dried in the oven for 15 min at 60 °C . Soft PDMS stiffness measurements . Gel stiffness was measured by indenting the gel with a large metal sphere ( diameter , 1 , 000 μ m ) of known mass . The indentation caused by the weight of the sphere was determined using confocal microscopy . From the measured indentation and sphere mass , we obtained Young’s modulus by applying Hertz theory , corrected for the finite thickness of the gel 33 . We found a Young’s modulus of 2 . 9 ± 0 . 5 kPa ( mean ± s . d . , n = 6 ) , in good agreement with published data 29 – 32 , 34 , 35 . Cell patterning on soft PDMS . PDMS patterning stamps were incubated with a fibronectin solution at 40 μ g / ml ( fibronectin from human plasma , Sigma - Aldrich ) for 1 h . Next , the protein was transferred to poly vinyl alcohol ( PVA , Sigma - Aldrich ) membranes which were then placed in contact with the gel surface for 1 h . Membranes were dissolved and the surface was passivated at the same time using Pluronic F127 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) 0 . 2 % w / v overnight at 4 °C . Afterwards , the soft silicone gels were washed with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS , Sigma - Aldrich ) and incubated with cell culture medium for 30 min . For cell seeding , the culture medium was removed and a 70 - μ l drop containing ~ 150 , 000 cells was placed on the soft PDMS . Fifty minutes after seeding , the unattached cells were washed away using PBS and more medium was added . Cells were seeded at least 48 h before experiments . PDMS patterning stamps . PDMS ( Sylgard , Dow Corning ) stamps for micropat - terning were fabricated . In brief , SU8 - 50 masters containing cylinders that were 80 μ m or 100 μ m in diameter were raised using conventional photolithography . Uncured PDMS was poured on the masters and cured for 2 h at 65 °C . PDMS was then peeled off from the master and kept at room temperature in a clean and dust - free environment until use . Three - dimensional traction microscopy . Three - dimensional traction forces were computed using traction microscopy with finite gel thickness 36 , 37 . To account for both geometrical and material nonlinearities , a finite element method ( FEM ) solu - tion was implemented . Confocal stacks of the fluorescent beads covering the gel surface were taken with z - step = 0 . 3 μ m and total depth of 15 μ m . A 3D displace - ment field of the top layer of the gel between any experimental time point and its relative reference image ( obtained after cell trypsinization ) were computed using home - made particle imaging velocimetry software based on an iterative algorithm with a dynamic interrogation window size and implementing convergence criteria based on image intensity as described in previous publications 38 . Results for the normal traction inside the dome were compared to analytical solutions for a liquid droplet over an elastic substrate with finite thickness 39 – 42 . Cell culture . MDCK strain II and Caco - 2 cells were used . To visualize specific cell structures , the following stable fluorescent cell lines were used : MDCK expressing LifeAct – GFP ( MDCK – LifeAct ) to visualize the actin cytoskeleton , MDCK express - ing CIBN – GFP – CAAX to visualize the plasma membrane ( MDCK – CAAX ) , MDCK expressing keratin - 18 – GFP ( MDCK – K18 ) to visualize intermediate fila - ments . All MDCK lines were cultured in minimum essential medium with Earle’s Salts and l - glutamine ( Gibco ) supplemented with 10 % v / v fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; Gibco ) , 100 μ g / ml penicillin and 100 μ g / ml streptomycin . Selection antibiotic geneticin ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) was added at 0 . 5 mg / ml to LifeAct stable cell lines . Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5 % CO 2 . Live imaging of F - actin was performed by incubating cells ( 12 h , 100 nM ) using live cell fluorogenic F - actin labelling probe ( SiR – actin , Spirochrome ) . Caco - 2 cells were imaged using BODIPY FL C16 dye ( 1 μ M , 1 h incubation , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . MDCK – LifeAct cells were obtained from the laboratory of B . Ladoux . MDCK keratin - 18 – GFP cells were obtained from the laboratory of G . Charras . MDCK – CAAX cells were obtained by viral infection of CIBN – GFP – CAAX . Caco - 2 cells were bought from Sigma Aldrich ( 86010202 ) . Cell lines tested nega - tive for mycoplasma contamination . All MDCK cell lines were authenticated by the laboratories that provided them . Caco - 2 cells were authenticated by the provider ( Sigma Aldrich , from the ECACC ) . Pharmacological interventions and osmotic shocks . To perturb actomyosin contractility , cells were treated with Rho kinase inhibitor Y - 27632 ( InSolution Calbiochem , Merck - Millipore , 30 μ M , 5 - min incubation ) . To inhibit ARP2 / 3 complex , cells were treated with CK666 ( Sigma Aldrich , 100 μ M , 1 - h incuba - tion ) . To perturb the osmolarity , d - mannitol ( Sigma - Aldrich , final concentration 100 mM ) was added to the medium . To weaken cell – cell junctions , EGTA ( Sigma - Aldrich , final concentration 2 mM , 30 - min incubation ) was added to the medium . Cell immunofluorescence . MDCK cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and permeabilized using 0 . 1 % Triton X100 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature . Cells were blocked in 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA , Sigma - Aldrich ) in PBS for 1 h ( at room temperature ) . Phalloidin ( Alexa Fluor 555 phalloidin , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) was then added at 1 : 1 , 000 dilution in PBS and incubated for 30 min at room temperature . To iden - tify nuclei , cells were then incubated for 10 min in a Hoechst solution ( Hoechst 33342 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) at 1 : 2 , 500 dilution in PBS . Images were acquired with a spinning disk confocal microscope using a Nikon 60 × oil 1 . 4 numerical aperture ( NA ) lens . Time - lapse microscopy . Multidimensional acquisition for traction force meas - urements was performed using an inverted Nikon microscope with a spinning disk confocal unit ( CSU - W1 , Yokogawa ) , Zyla sCMOS camera ( Andor , image size 2 , 048 × 2 , 048 pixels ) using a Nikon 40 × 0 . 75 NA air lens . The microscope was equipped with temperature control and CO 2 control , using Andor iQ3 or Micro - Manager software 43 . Laser ablation . The set - up used has previously been described 44 . In brief , MDCK keratin - 18 – GFP cells were cultured on thin PDMS micropatterned substrates and allowed to form domes . We then used a sub - nanosecond ultraviolet pulsed laser to ablate individual filament bundles in weakly stretched and superstretched cells . Immediately after ablation we monitored the time evolution of keratin filaments , and we obtained bright - field images of the domes to measure cell area . Experiments were performed at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 . Photoactivatable cytochalasin D . We used a phototriggerable derivative of cyto - chalasin D that includes a nitroveratryloxycarbonyl photoremovable group located at the hydroxyl group at C7 of cytochalasin D . Attachment of the chromophore renders cytochalasin D temporarily inactive . Upon light exposure , cytochalasin D becomes active and causes local depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton . For experiments , MDCK – CAAX domes were incubated with SiR – actin to visualize the cortical cytoskeleton . Individual cells were illuminated with a 405 - nm laser to activate cytochalasin D . After the pulse , the cell area and actin cytoskeleton were visualized using time - lapse microscopy ( 63 × oil , Zeiss LSM 880 ) . Image analysis . Fiji software was used to perform the image analysis 45 . The pair - wise stitching plugin was used to create 3D montages , the maximum intensity z - projection and the sum - slices z - projection were used where appropriate . Actual cell areas were computed from z - projections using the methodology described in Supplementary Note 4 . Animals . Animal care and experiments were carried out according to protocols approved by the Ethics Committee on Animal Research of the Science Park of Barcelona ( PCB ) , Spain ( Protocol number 7436 ) . Outbred B6CBAF1 / JRj mice ( male and females of 5 – 6 weeks of age ) were obtained from Janvier Labs . Mice were kept in a 12 h light : dark cycle ( lights on 07 : 00 – 19 : 00 ) with ad libitum access to food and water . Embryo collection and in vitro culture . For embryo collection , superovulation was induced in B6CBAF1 / JRj female mice by intraperitoneal injection of 7 . 5 I . U . of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin ( PMSG ) , followed—after 48 h—by 7 . 5 I . U . of human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) . Superovulated females were then paired with male mice , and subsequently euthanized by cervical dislocation 20 h after hCG injection . Then , one - cell stage embryos ( zygotes ) were collected from the excised oviducts into medium containing 0 . 1 % ( w / v ) hyaluronidase ( Sigma ) to remove cumulus cells under a dissection microscope . Recovered zygotes were cultured in micro - droplets of culture medium covered with mineral oil at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 until the blastocyst stage . No randomization nor blinding were performed as experiments did not involve comparisons between groups . Experiments were reproduced four times . Blastocyst immunofluorescence . Blastocysts at different degrees of development were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Aname ) for 20 min at room temperature . Then , fixed blastocysts were washed three times with PBS containing 1 % bovine © 2018 Springer Nature Limited . All rights reserved . Article reSeArcH serum albumin ( Sigma ) , 2 % goat serum ( Sigma ) and 0 . 01 % Triton X - 100 ( Sigma ) , referred to as blocking buffer . Next , blastocysts were permeabilized with 2 . 5 % Triton X - 100 ( Sigma ) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and subsequently washed three times with blocking buffer . Blastocysts were incubated overnight at 4 °C in anti - E - cadherin primary antibody ( 610181 , BD Biosciences ) , diluted 1 : 50 in blocking buffer . The following day , blastocysts were washed three times with block - ing buffer and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C in Alexa Fluor ( A ) 488 - conjugated secondary antibody ( A21202 , Thermo Fisher ) , diluted 1 : 200 in blocking buffer . Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI ( D1306 , Life Technologies ) for 30 min . Image acquisition was performed in a SP5 Leica microscope or a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope using a plan - apochromat 40 × oil DIC M27 objective . Code availability .
