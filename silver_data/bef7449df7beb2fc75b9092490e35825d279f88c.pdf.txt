In budding yeast , most of the proteins known to be fluorescence microscopy and particle tracking algo - rithms , we define an early endocytic pathway wherein involved in endocytic internalization localize to punctate cortical structures that often partially or fully colocalize an invariant sequence of changes in cortical patch protein composition correlates with changes in patch with cortical actin patches , structures of mysterious ori - gin and function that were first observed in fixed cells motility .

Positions of the centers of patches were determined in each frame of a movie from a medial focal plane of a cell and consecutive positions were connected by lines .

The time difference between each position along the track is 0 . 25 s for Abp1 - GFP and Arc15 - GFP , 0 . 5 s for Sla1 - GFP , Pan1 - GFP , and Sla2 - GFP , and 1 s for Las17 - GFP due to different exposure times needed to visualize different patch proteins .

( E – F ) Quantitation of fluorescence intensity and distance from the site of patch formation for Abp1 - GFP ( E ) and Sla1 - GFP ( F ) labeled patches as a function of time . Each curve represents data from one patch . Fluorescence intensity over time was corrected for photobleaching . Data shown for four ( E ) or five ( F ) patches . Cell478 patches develops in a very regular manner , increasing first , and then decreasing ( Figures 1E and 1F ) . Fast movement of Abp1p patches away from the site of for - mation starts suddenly and only after the intensity has already fallen considerably ( Figure 1E ) . In contrast , Sla1p patches started to move at the time when their fluorescence intensity just begins to decline ( Figure 1F ) . Abp1p and the Sla1p intensity developed in a highly regular manner , suggesting that the assembly and dis - assembly of endocytic complexes is tightly regulated . The changes in intensity appear intimately linked to the onset of motility . The average apparent speed of the Sla1p patches in the plane of focus during the motile phase is about 25 nm / s . The speed of Abp1p patches during the final fast phase is about 230 nm / s . Spatiotemporal Colocalization of Patch Proteins To reveal the spatiotemporal relationships between dif - ferent patch proteins , we coexpressed GFP and CFP tagged pairs of proteins , and imaged the cells in real time with a YFP / CFP filter set . YFP tagged proteins photo - bleached too quickly to be useful for collection of images over time . Although the GFP signal is low through YFP filters , there was no detectable bleed - through and the signal was very stable . Remarkably , the two - color analyses revealed an in - variant pathway in which different proteins are recruited to patches in a sequential manner . For example , Sla1 - GFP appeared at patches early , and was later joined by Abp1 - CFP ( Figures 2A and 2B and Supplemental Movie S4 ) . The two proteins coexisted on a patch only tran - siently , with Sla1 - GFP disappearing from the patch shortlybeforeAbp1 - CFP . Sla1 - GFPpatcheswereinvari - ably joined by Abp1 - CFP shortly before the patches disappeared ( n (cid:4) 141 patches ) . Conversely , Abp1 - GFP patches were always derived from Sla1 - CFP patches ( n (cid:4) 151 ) . This behavior explains the finding that only about 30 % of Sla1p patches contain Abp1p ( Warren et al . , 2002 ) . Las17pandSla2pshowedrelationshipstoAbp1psim - ilar to Sla1p . Both appeared at a cortical patch early and were later joined by Abp1p ( Figures 2C , 2D , 2G , and 2H and Supplemental Movies S5 and S7 ) . Pan1p colocalized with Sla1p extensively ( Figures 2E and 2F and Supplemental Movie S6 ) . Arc15p , however , joined Sla1p patches late , similar to Abp1p ( Figures 2I and 2J and Supplemental Movie S8 ) , and showed essentially complete colocalization with Abp1p ( data not shown ) . Furthermore , Sla1p showed nearly complete colocaliza - tion with both Las17p and Sla2p throughout the patch lifetime ( data not shown ) . These results suggest that Figure 2 .

Upper and middle panels show two separate channels and onset of patch movements suggest that the changes the lower panel shows merged images . in patch composition are coupled to changes in patch behavior . To illustrate this point , in Figure 3A we show an alignment of averaged intensity and distance curves for Sla1 - GFP and Abp1 - GFP patches using the data A Pathway for Endocytic Internalization 479 from the patch just before the fast Abp1p - associated patch movements start ( Figure 3A ) . As Abp1p and F - actin show indistinguishable localization at cortical patches in fixed cells ( Drubin et al . , 1988 ) , and as the Arp2 / 3 complex component Arc15p colocalized exten - sively with Abp1p ( data not shown ) , we hypothesized that actin polymerization might propel endocytic vesi - cles containing Sla1p , Sla2p , and Pan1p into the cyto - plasm ( Figure 3B ) as has been proposed for clathrin - coated vesicles in mammalian cells ( Merrifield et al . , 2002 ) . To test this possibility , we incubated cells ex - pressing Sla1 - GFP with 200 (cid:5) M latrunculin A ( lat A ) , a drug that sequesters actin monomers ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ) . This treatment leads to disassembly of cortical actin patches and to delocalization of Abp1p from the cell cortex into the cytoplasm ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ) . LatAtreatmentalsoinhibitsendocytosis . Patchlocaliza - tion of Sla1p and Sla2p is known to be resistant to lat A treatment ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ) . Interestingly , the movement of Sla1 - GFP patches was completely blocked by lat A ( Figures 3C and 3D and Supplemental Movies S9 and S10 ) . Also , Sla1 - GFP patch disassembly was inhibited by lat A , with these patches being stable for at least 2 min compared to about 30 s in the non - treated cells . Lat A treatment also inhibited movement of Pan1p patches and the disappearance of Pan1p and Las17p from patches ( data not shown ) . These results demonstrate that actin polymerization is required for the movement of the presumed endocytic vesicle and its associated protein complex away from the plasma membrane , and for the subsequent disassembly of the complex . Our results presented thus far reveal a pathway in which endocytic proteins become associated with corti - cal patches on the plasma membrane in an invariant order , then move away from the cell cortex , toward the interior of the cell , finally disassembling . We propose that this dynamic pathway represents the endocytic in - ternalization process . Since Sla2p , also referred to as Figure 3 . Patch Stabilization in Absence of Actin or Sla2p Function End4p , has been shown to be required for endocytic ( A ) Alignment of averaged intensity and distance measurements of internalization , we next tested effects of sla2 (cid:6) on patch Sla1p and Abp1p patches .

However , instead of normal punctate cortical actin patches , we observed comet tails associ - ated with the cell cortex . To analyze how these comet tails change over time , we collected images at 0 . 5 s presented in Figures 1E and 1F . The curves were aligned based on two - color movies , though the data presented intervals for 1 min . In contrast to the rapid movement of Abp1 - GFP patches in wild - type cells , we observed are from separate single color movies of Sla1 - GFP and Abp1 - GFP .

Actin - GFP showed normal actin patch localization in wild - type To analyze the localization of additional patch compo - nents in sla2 (cid:6) cells , we next observed both Pan1 - CFP / cells , and localization in the actin comet tails in sla2 (cid:6) cells . We chose areas densely packed with actin comet Abp1 - GFP and Las17 - CFP / Abp1 - GFP pairs in an sla2 (cid:6) strain . Pan1p and Las17p both localized to the junctions tails for the FRAP experiments to average out the effect of continuous waving of individual comet tails .

To further Actin Filament Assembly Is Nucleated at Endocytic Sites test this possibility , a bar was bleached across the comet tails near where they contact the cell cortex . As Actin can generate forces either by new filament assem - bly , as occurs at the leading edge of a migrating cell , shown in Figure 6C and Supplemental Movie S18 , the Cell482 Figure 6 .

Discussion Moreover , after the photobleaching fully recovered , stripes with similar slopes due to nonuniformity in the An Early Endocytic Pathway A model for the early endocytic pathway in budding assembling actin comet tails , continued to be observed in the kymographs ( Figures 6B and 6D ) , reinforcing the yeast is presented in Figure 7 . First , several early pro - teins , including Arp2 / 3 activators and endocytic adap - conclusion that at steady - state actin in the comet tails continuously assembles near the cortical endocytic tors and scaffolds , assemble in a nonmotile complex at the plasma membrane . Whether cargo proteins are complexes and disassembles toward the cell interior . Interestingly , FRAP analysis of Arc15 - GFP , which is recruited to this complex subsequent to its formation or vice versa is presently not known . These early pro - present throughout the tails , gave a similar rate and pattern of recovery to actin - GFP ( data not shown ) . In teins are known to interact with each other physically . A Pathway for Endocytic Internalization 483 Figure 7 . Pathway for the Association of Receptors , Adaptors , and Actin during Endocytic Internalization Time in seconds indicated at top . See text for description . For example , Sla1p can bind directly to Sla2p , Pan1p , is recruited to the endocytic site just as a membrane invagination is formed , has been observed in mamma - and Las17p ( Gourlay et al . , 2003 ; Li , 1997 ; Tang et al . , 2000 ) . Actin , Abp1p , and the Arp2 / 3 complex are re - lian cells ( Merrifield et al . , 2002 ) . We note that essentially all of the proteins investigated in our study have mam - cruited late in the life of the patch , whereupon the com - plex containing Sla1p , Sla2p , and Pan1p moves away malian counterparts that have been implicated in endo - cytosis , and therefore speculate that general features from the plasma membrane , toward the interior of the cell . The early patch components are disassembled dur - of the pathway presented here are widely conserved . ing this directed , actin - dependent slow movement phase . The patches containing only late components Does the Model Fit the Earlier Observations ? Since actin patches were first observed some two de - then transition to a fast movement phase during which the late components are disassembled . We speculate cades ago , their functions have been unclear and expla - nations for their properties obscure . that forces from actin polymerization propel the early complex into the cytoplasm , and possibly invaginate First , it has been observed that there are different kinds of cortical patches with different protein composi - the plasma membrane and contract the vesicle neck to release an endocytic vesicle . The early components are tions and motile properties ( Warren et al . , 2002 ) . Do different classes of patch exist ? Our real - time two - color likely to be disassembled as a response to phosphoryla - tion by Prk1 and Ark1 kinases . Prk1p - dependent phos - analysis of patch dynamics provided an answer . The different kinds of cortical patches observed previously phorylation of Pan1p and Sla1p has been shown to pre - vent these two proteins from interacting ( Zeng et al . , are different intermediates along the highly regulated endocytic internalization pathway . The changes in the 2001 ) . Ark1p and Prk1p are localized to actin patches in an Abp1p - dependent manner ( Cope et al . , 1999 ) , and patch protein composition take place in a predictable and invariant sequence and they correlate with changes are thus likely to be late patch components . In fact , inhibition of Ark kinase activity causes the Arp2 / 3 - in patch motility ( Figures 1 and 2 ) . A second open question was whether actin polymer - dependent accumulation of large actin clumps that con - tain endocytic vesicles and many known cortical patch ization is needed for patch motility . Different investiga - tors have made apparently contradictory observations proteins ( Cope et al . , 1999 ; Sekiya - Kawasaki et al . , 2003 ) . Sla2p appears to couple actin polymerization and about whether patch motility requires Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin filament assembly ( Belmont and Drubin , 1998 ; endocytic internalization because actin is continuously nucleated from nonmotile endocytic complexes in Carlsson et al . , 2002 ; Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ; Winter et al . , 1997 ) . Our group has observed that muta - sla2 (cid:6) cells . It is striking that , despite the lack of evidence for tionsinactinorcofilinthatgreatlyreduceactinassemblyanddisassemblykineticshavenoeffectontheaverage a direct involvement of clathrin and dynamin in yeast endocytosis , asimilarsequenceofevents , inwhichactin rate of patch motility ( Belmont and Drubin , 1998 ; Lappa - Cell484 lainen and Drubin , 1997 ) . Others , however , reported that either because the association is too transient , or be - cause the cargo is not sufficiently concentrated , or both . patch motility was reduced in mutants of the Arp2 / 3 complex , and they therefore suggested that patches We speculate that when endocytosis is blocked in sla2 (cid:6) cells , cargo proteins “pile up” at the blocked endo - may move by a mechanism akin to the one in which actin polymerization propels certain intracellular pathogens cytic sites . through the cytoplasm ( Winter et al . , 1997 ) . Our pathway model provides a harmonious interpretation of these Distinct Roles for Three Arp2 / 3 Activators disparate observations . We observed that two different The Arp2 / 3 complex , which is a major nucleator of actin kindsofpatchmotilityexist : directedshortrangemotility filaments , is essential for yeast endocytosis ( Moreau et of patches containing both early ( Sla1p , Sla2p , Pan1p ) al . , 1997 ) . Importantly , this complex does not work and late ( Abp1p , Arc15p ) patch components , and more alone , but requires an activating cofactor . Three bud - rapid long range movement of patches containing only ding yeast Arp2 / 3 activators are known , and each of the late components ( Figure 1C ) . The short - range motil - these proteins is localized to cortical patches . These ity takes place when actin joins the patch and the long - activators are Las17p ( yeast WASP ) , Pan1p ( yeast range motility follows immediately thereafter when early Eps15 ) , and Abp1p . Importantly , we showed that each patch components are gone . Both the actin poison latA behaves in a distinct manner , suggesting distinct roles and an sla2 (cid:6) mutation prevent the onset of the first in endocytic internalization ( Figures 1B and 1C ) . Las17p motility phase ( Figure 3 ) . We propose that the first phase has the longest lifetime and therefore appears to be the of motility represents endocytic vesicle formation and first activator in the patches . Pan1p is also an early release dependent on Arp2 / 3 - nucleated actin filament component . However , when the patch complex moves assembly , and that the second phase of motility is the away from the cell cortex , Pan1p , but not Las17p , is actin independent movement of a newly released endo - still associated with the complex . As this movement is cytic vesicle . The second phase is dependent on the dependent on actin polymerization , Pan1p could be the first but may not directly require actin polymerization . If Arp2 / 3 activator that triggers vesicle release . This possi - the first phase is completely blocked , there is no second bility is consistent with the observations that pan1 mu - phase . However , when the first phase is only partially tants accumulate long plasma membrane invaginations , impaired , the second phase can proceed normally , al - consistent with failure of vesicle scission ( Wendland et beit at a reduced frequency . al . , 1996 ) , and that mammalian Eps15 , related to Pan1p , decorates rims of clathrin - coated pits , where it is well - positioned to participate in scission ( Tebar et al . , 1996 ) . Are Cortical Patches Sites of Endocytosis ? Abp1p localizes to the patches late in the pathway Inherent to our endocytic model is the assumption that when actin recruitment to patches is maximal . Abp1p cortical patches are sites of endocytosis . However , is nonessential but deletion of ABP1 in sla2 (cid:6) mutants whether this is the case has been a matter of some is lethal ( Wesp et al . , 1997 ) , so it may have a fine - tuning debate . Arguing in favor of such an involvement were role , perhaps modulating stability of Arp2 / 3 - generated the observations that endocytic internalization can be branches formed when Las17p and / or Pan1p activates blocked both by mutations in many cortical patch pro - the Arp2 / 3 complex . A similar proposal for sequential teins and by chemical or genetic impairment of actin functioning by Arp2 / 3 activators has been made for filament turnover . Moreover , one patch protein , Sla1p , mammalian cortactin and WASP ( Uruno et al . , 2003 ) . is thought to interact directly with the cytoplasmic tail The initiation of Arp2 / 3 and actin recruitment to the of the endocytic cargo protein Ste2p ( Howard et al . , endocytic complex appears to be delayed compared to 2002 ) . In addition , mammalian Hip1R and Eps15 , which the appearance of the Arp2 / 3 activators Las17p and are homologs of the budding yeast patch proteins Sla2p Pan1p . This suggests that the activities of these activa - andPan1p , respectively , bothlocalizetoclathrin - coated tors are negatively regulated , with their activation re - pits , which are known to be sites of endocytic internal - sulting in a burst of actin polymerization once the patch ization ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 1999 ; Tebar et al . , structures have acquired a certain size , composition , or 1996 ) . While clathrin - coated pits have not been ob - architecture . Potential inhibitors of Las17p activity are served in budding yeast , actin , cofilin , and Abp1p were SH3domainproteinsSla1pand Bbc1p , whicheachhave shown by immuno electron microscopy to associate a biochemical inhibitory activity toward Las17p ( Rodal with fingerlike plasma membrane invaginations that et al . , 2003 ) . Sla2p is another candidate to negatively could be intermediates in a pathway for endocytic vesi - regulate Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin nucleation at endocytic cle formation ( Mulholland et al . , 1994 ) . Arguing against sites because sla2 (cid:6) cells have more cortical F - actin a direct involvement of patch proteins in endocytosis than wild - type cells ( Figure 4 ) ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 ) . was the observation that endocytic cargos have shown poor or nonexistent colocalization with actin patches by light and electron microscopy ( Mulholland et al . , 1999 ) . Actin Polymerization Is Nucleated at Endocytic Sites and Made Productive by Sla2p Here , an association between the endocytic cargo protein Ste2p and patch proteins could be seen . How - Sla2p has an N - terminal ENTH domain that binds PIP 2 , a central coiled - coil region that interacts with clathrin , ever , colocalization was only observed when endocytic internalization was blocked by an sla2 (cid:6) mutation ( Figure and a C - terminal talin - like actin binding domain . Sla2p could thus potentially be required to link endocytic pro - 5C ) . This result is the first direct demonstration of an association between the endocytic cargo protein Ste2p teins to the actin cytoskeleton . However , we observed that cells lacking Sla2p form a stable association be - and patches . Observing the association of Ste2p with cortical patches in wild - type cells may not be possible tween actin comet tails , endocytic cargo , and adaptors .

Simple suggest the former possibility . Using FRAP analysis on thresholding using a constant threshold value did not give good actin comet tails formed in sla2 (cid:6) cells , we were able to results , as the local background was variable . The patch positions demonstrate that actin assembly is nucleated at endo - were then determined by calculating the center of fluorescence cytic sites ( Figure 6 ) . Another unresolved issue was intensity for each patch . The patch positions from each frame of a movie were finally connected to the patch position in the next frame whether yeast are capable of rapid actin polymerization to trace the patch trajectories . The thresholding parameters were at rates characteristic of assembly in motile cells . Since selected to give results that agreed with visual inspection of the yeast are nonmotile and reportedly have low levels of patch behavior . The tracking results were visually confirmed by free actin monomers , it has been speculated that their comparing trajectories to the original movies . Patches that at any actin cytoskeletons might be very static by comparison point in their lifetime were too close to another patch to be clearly to those of motile cells wherein actin filaments can un - resolved were excluded from our analysis . Patch lifetime analyses were done by visually identifying the time points of appearance dergo very rapid cycles of assembly and disassembly and disappearance of individual patches from the movies .
