2278 A n extensive body of work has demonstrated that athero - sclerotic plaques form preferentially at sites of disturbed blood flow encountered at vessel bifurcations , resulting in part from the loss of anti - inflammatory , antithrombotic , and anti - oxidative effects that occur in straight vessel segments because of laminar pulsatile flow . 1 The production of nitric oxide ( NO ) by endothelial NO synthase ( eNOS ) is a central mechanism of these protective effects . 2 Transcriptional and posttransla - tional regulation of eNOS combine to augment NO produc - tion in response to flow - induced mechanical stimulation of the apical endothelial cell surface . 3 AMPK ( AMP - activated protein kinase ) and the deacetylase sirtuin 1 ( SIRT1 ) are key mediators of multiple vascular endothelial processes . AMPK mediates metformin - induced protection from oxidative stress 4 and regulates coronary hemodynamics 5 and arteriogenesis , 6 whereas SIRT1 suppresses endothelial senescence produced by disturbed flow . 7 Laminar flow increases the activity of both AMPK and SIRT1 , which then act synergistically on eNOS via phosphorylation by AMPK priming and subsequent deacetylation by SIRT1 to increase NO bioavailability . 8 See accompanying article on page 2358 In the current issue of Arteriosclerosis , Thrombosis , and Vascular Biology , Shentu et al 9 now substantially advance our understanding of this important process by demonstrating that AMPK and SIRT1 similarly work together to coregulate func - tion of the actin - binding protein cortactin , leading to altered peripheral cytoskeletal and membrane structures in vascu - lar endothelial cells that , in turn , contribute to eNOS activa - tion and decreased atherosclerosis . Cortactin is a multidomain cytoskeletal scaffold protein that was first identified > 20 years ago as a novel F - actin - binding protein and substrate of v - Src . 10 The gene encoding cortactin , EMS1 , was initially detected as highly overexpressed in human carcinomas 11 but subsequently recognized as ubiquitously expressed in almost all tissues and is especially abundant in the endothelium . Cortactin is an ideal candidate to integrate signal transduction and cytoskeletal structural changes because of its ability to bind actin , interact with a variety of cytoskeletal effector proteins , including Arp 2 / 3 ( actin - related protein complex 2 and 3 ) , N - WASP ( neural Wiskott – Aldrich Syndrome protein ) , and MLCK ( myosin light chain kinase ) , and serve as a target for key regulatory kinases , including Src , ERK ( extracellular signal - regulated kinase ) , and c - Abl ( mammalian Abelson tyrosine kinase ) . 12 , 13 The peripheral cellular distribution of cortactin and its association with corti - cal actin were early observations are implicit in its name and further strengthen the idea that cortactin is an important link between extracellular stimuli , cytoskeletal organization , and membrane dynamics . Over the past 2 decades , critical roles for cortactin have been described in cell migration , tumor invasion , host – pathogen interactions , endocytosis , vesicle trafficking , intercellular junctional assembly , leukocyte diapedesis , and endothelial barrier function . 12 , 14 – 16 These processes are essen - tial components of vascular endothelial function and pathology , and it is not surprising that this tissue has served as the back - drop for much of the work highlighting the diverse structural and functional roles of cortactin . As noted earlier , mechanisms by which blood flow induces atherosclerosis or atheroprotec - tion are intriguing areas of investigation requiring the endo - thelial cell to translate properties of the local environment , especially flow , into dynamic alterations of the cytoskeleton , cell membrane , and biochemical signaling . 17 , 18 The present study identifying cortactin as a key player in atheroprotective eNOS regulation sheds new light on how laminar pulsatile flow mediates atheroprotection and serves to expand the influential role and importance of this protein in endothelial biology . The authors hypothesized that pulsatile flow leads to concerted regulation of cortactin by AMPK / SIRT1 similar to that observed in eNOS because cortactin contains con - sensus sequences for both proteins . After confirming spe - cific AMPK phosphorylation of cortactin at threonine - 401 in proteomic experiments , they subsequently demonstrate AMPK priming of cortactin for SIRT1 deacetylation in cultured endothelial cells subjected to pulsatile shear stress . Next , using gene knockdown and both gain and loss of function mutants in an elegant series of experiments , Shentu et al 9 determined that activated cortactin plays a direct role in eNOS activation in response to pulsatile shear stress . Mechanistically , this occurs via cortactin transloca - tion to the periphery in a close association with F - actin , which subsequently facilitates the transfer of eNOS from lipid to nonlipid raft domains , eNOS phosphorylation , and generation of atheroprotective NO . Finally , in vivo studies in cortactin + / − mice revealed impaired NO production and flow - induced vasodilation associated with reduced caveo - lae and phosphorylated eNOS at the cellular level . This endothelial dysfunction was associated with an increase in atherosclerotic plaques in Apolipoprotein E − / − cortactin + / − animals as compared with Apolipoprotein E − / − cortactin + / + .

Cortactin is a rich target for investigation into the coor - dination of numerous signaling pathways terminating in altered peripheral cytoskeletal and membrane dynamics , qualities vital to endothelial migration , barrier integrity , and interaction with the local physical and cellular environment . Interestingly , differential patterns of cortactin phosphoryla - tion lead to markedly different outcomes in actin structure and function . Serine and tyrosine phosphorylation by Src and ERK affects cortactin’s interaction with effectors of actin polymerization and tensile force generation , 15 , 19 , 20 with Src tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin also associated with focal adhesion disassembly and turnover . 21 Although threo - nine - 401 phosphorylation by Akt has been implicated in can - cer cell migration and invasion , 22 the current study adds to this complexity with phosphorylation at this same threonine - 401 site by AMPK , significantly impacting cortactin – F - actin asso - ciation and regulation of membrane - associated caveolae . The specific alterations in cytoskeletal structure and dynamics responsible for these varied effects remain unknown and are intriguing areas for further study . The vascular endothelium is a varied and intensely regu - lated tissue with the ability to adapt its structure and function specifically to the requirements of each organ system and Figure . Atheroprotective eNOS activation is mediated by AMPK / SIRT1 and cortactin . Endothelial cells exposed to laminar pulsatile flow ( bottom cell ) demonstrate AMPK phosphorylation of cortactin on threonine - 401 , priming it for subsequent deacetylation by SIRT1 . After these modifications , cortactin locates to cortical regions where it associates with F - actin to chaperone eNOS from lipid rafts to the cyto - plasm . Subsequent eNOS activation increases nitric oxide to produce vasodilation and reduce atherosclerotic plaque formation . In areas of turbulent flow ( top cell ) , a lack of AMPK / SIRT1 activation and absence of the downstream cytoskeletal rearrangements mediated by cortactin reduce eNOS activation and nitric oxide bioavailability to increase atherosclerotic plaques .
