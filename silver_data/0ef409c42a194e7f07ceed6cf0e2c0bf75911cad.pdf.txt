Previous studies on tool site selection have addressed the relevance of targeted 27 resources and raw materials for tools , but few have considered the broader foraging 28 landscape . In this first landscape - scale study of the ecological contexts of wild chimpanzee 29 ( Pan troglodytes verus ) tool - use , we investigate the conditions required for nut - cracking to 30 occur and persist over time at discrete locations in Bossou ( Guinea ) . We examine this at three 31 levels : selection , frequency of use , and inactivity . We find that , further to the presence of a nut 32 tree and availability of raw materials , abundance of food - providing trees as well as proximity 33 to nest sites were significant predictors of nut - cracking occurrence . This suggests that the 34 spatial distribution of nut - cracking sites is mediated by the broader behavioural landscape and 35 is influenced by non - extractive foraging of predictable resources , as well as non - foraging 36 activities . Additionally , the number of functional tools was greater at sites with higher frequency 37 of nut - cracking and was negatively correlated with site inactivity . Our findings indicate that the 38 technological landscape of the Bossou chimpanzees shares affinities with the ‘favoured 39 places’ model of hominin site formation and provides new insights for reconstructing ancient 40 patterns of landscape use . 41 42 Key words : behavioural ecology , landscape - use , nut - cracking , primate archaeology , wild 43 chimpanzees 44 45 Résumé 46 L’écologie est fondamentale pour le développement , la transmission et la pérennité de 47 la technologie des primates . Des études antérieures ont identifié la disponibilité des 48 ressources cibles ainsi que les matières premières pour les outils comme des facteurs 49 3 influents dans la sélection des emplacements pour les activités technologiques . Cependant , 50 il y a peu d ' études qui abordent cette recherche à l ' échelle du paysage et du comportement 51 fourrager . Dans cette première étude paysagère sur l ' utilisation d ' outils par le chimpanzé 52 sauvage ( Pan troglodytes verus ) , nous recherchons les conditions écologiques qui influencent 53 la sélection , l ' utilisation et l ' inactivité des emplacements utilisés pour le cassage des noix en 54 Bossou , Guinée . Nos résultats montrent qu ' en plus de la présence d ' un noyer et de la 55 disponibilité des matières premières , l ' abondance d ' arbres nourriciers ainsi que la proximité 56 des sites de nidification étaient des prédicteurs significatifs de l ' occurrence du cassage des 57 noix . Cela suggère que la distribution spatiale des sites de cassage de noix est influencée par 58 le paysage comportemental et est influencée par le fourrage non - extractive de ressources 59 prévisibles , ainsi que par des activités non - fourragers . Nos résultats indiquent que le paysage 60 technologique des chimpanzés de Bossou partage des affinités avec le modèle des « lieux 61 favoris » de la formation des sites hominidés et fournit de nouvelles perspectives pour 62 reconstruire les modes d ' utilisation du paysage anciens . 63 64 Introduction 65 Ecology plays an important role in shaping non - human primate behaviour from foraging 66 strategies , to ranging patterns , and sociality ( Robbins and Hohmann , 2006 ; Strier , 2011 ) . Tool - 67 use , particularly for extractive foraging , is no exception . Recent studies have highlighted that 68 ecology is key in determining whether tool - use emerges in a population , how it manifests itself , 69 and how it is maintained once it is established ( S . Carvalho et al . , 2007 , 2011 ; Grund et al . , 70 2019 ; Koops et al . , 2013 , 2014 ) . 71 Stone tool - use is often recurrent in spatially discrete locations , frequently involves the 72 reuse of tools , and leaves a recognisable archaeological footprint that can be traced back 73 thousands of years ( Falótico et al . , 2019 ; Mercader et al . , 2007 ) . However , little is known about 74 the ecological factors influencing selection and repeated use of specific locations for these 75 4 activities and how they fit within the broader foraging landscape . Lithic - based foraging 76 technology has been recorded in several wild , non - human primate species including 77 chimpanzees ( Pan troglodytes ssp . ; Whiten et al . , 1999 ) , bearded capuchin monkeys 78 ( Sapajus libidinosus ; Ottoni and Izar , 2008 ) , Burmese long - tailed macaques ( Macaca 79 fascicularis ; Gumert , Kluck and Malaivijitnond , 2009 ) , and , most recently , in white - faced 80 capuchins ( Cebus capuchinus ; Barrett et al . , 2018 ) . 81 Chimpanzees are of particular interest because they are our closest living relatives 82 ( Langergraber et al . , 2012 ) , and they present the largest , most diverse and ecologically 83 adaptable technological repertoire compared to any other non - human species , reflecting a 84 level of cognitive flexibility akin to the earliest hominin toolmakers ( S . Carvalho et al . , 2013 ; 85 Pascual - Garrido and Almeida - Warren , 2021 ; Rolian and Carvalho , 2017 ) . Chimpanzee nut - 86 cracking assemblages have been found to have close similarities to the low - density 87 assemblages characteristic of the early hominin record ( S . Carvalho et al . , 2008 ; S . Carvalho 88 and McGrew , 2012 ) . Thus , understanding how patterns of nut - cracking behaviour accumulate 89 across the landscape can provide valuable insights into the formation and spatial distribution 90 of early hominin assemblages and allow the modelling of ancient landscape use and resource 91 exploitation . 92 Previous research on chimpanzee nut - cracking has established that the spatial 93 availability of nut trees and raw materials for tools influences site location and reuse , as well 94 as frequency and distance of tool transport ( S . Carvalho et al . , 2007 , 2011 ) . Nevertheless , 95 nut - cracking assemblages are yet to be explored within the context of the broader ecological 96 and foraging landscape . This requires the study of nut - cracking sites not only in relation to 97 direct ecological correlates such as access to raw materials and nuts , but also in relation to 98 ecological requirements of other daily activities critical to survival such as food , water , and 99 shelter . 100 Chimpanzees living in forested environments spend approximately 50 % of their waking 101 hours foraging and travelling between feeding locations ( Pruetz and Bertolani , 2009 ) . Recent 102 studies have shown that chimpanzee ranging patterns are dynamic and are influenced by the 103 5 spatial distribution and seasonality of food ( Trapanese et al . , 2019 ) , which may also determine 104 where non - foraging activities , such as nesting , take place ( Basabose and Yamagiwa , 2002 ; 105 Hernandez - Aguilar , 2009 ; Janmaat et al . , 2014 ) . Their diet mainly consists of fruit ( Morgan 106 and Sanz , 2006 ) , but high - energy foods such as insects , nuts and honey acquired through 107 tool - assisted foraging are also important staples or nutritional supplements for many 108 chimpanzee populations ( Sanz and Morgan , 2013 ) . Yet , little is known about how extractive 109 foraging interacts with other feeding activities and the broader behavioural landscape . This 110 study explores this question for the first time in the context of chimpanzee nut - cracking using 111 stone tools . 112 Water is essential to life ( Popkin et al . , 2010 ) . For non - human primate species living in 113 extremely arid conditions , such as savannah - dwelling chimpanzees and baboons , water is a 114 critical resource that constrains movement patterns and landscape use ( Barton et al . , 1992 ; 115 Pruetz and Herzog , 2017 ; Wessling et al . , 2018 ) . It has also featured in many discussions 116 surrounding early hominin evolution and behaviour ( Joordens et al . , 2019 ) , and has been 117 spatially linked with early stone tool sites ( Rogers et al . , 1994 ) . Similarly , the location of 118 chimpanzee nut - cracking sites has been suggested to coincide with the proximity to 119 hydrological features , such as streams and rivers ( S . Carvalho et al . , 2007 ) , possibly because 120 they are the most likely sources of eroded lithic raw materials for tools ( S . Carvalho , 2011 ) , 121 although this remains to be empirically tested . 122 Chimpanzees habitually make a sleeping nest at the end of every day , and sometimes 123 make day nests for resting ( Koops et al . , 2012 ) . They have been an important focus of 124 research since Sept ( 1992 ) recognised that they form clusters of debris akin to early hominin 125 assemblages , and saw their potential for understanding patterns of early hominin landscape 126 use and the origins of human shelter ( Mcgrew , 2021 ) . Nesting locations have subsequently 127 been linked with a range of ecological parameters such as tree species and tree architecture , 128 as well as surrounding topography and vegetation types ( Badji et al . , 2018 ; J . S . Carvalho et 129 al . , 2015 ; Hernandez - Aguilar , 2009 ; Hernandez - Aguilar et al . , 2013 ; Koops et al . , 2012 ; 130 Ndiaye et al . , 2018 ; Stewart et al . , 2011 ) . Other studies have found additional links between 131 6 nest sites and proximity to areas of high fruit availability ( Basabose and Yamagiwa , 2002 ; 132 Furuichi and Hashimoto , 2004 ; Goodall , 1962 ; Janmaat et al . , 2014 ) . While the exact 133 conditions determining nest site suitability appears to be population - specific rather than 134 universal , these findings demonstrate that nesting activities shape chimpanzee landscape 135 use , and , in turn , are shaped by resource distribution and the local environment . Nevertheless , 136 little is known about how nesting relates to other activities such as spatially discreet forms of 137 tool use ( e . g . , nut - cracking and termite - fishing ) . 138 This is the first landscape - scale investigation of the ecological drivers of chimpanzee 139 tool - use , where we examine the conditions required for nut - cracking to occur and persist over 140 time in discrete locations at the long - term field site of Bossou ( Guinea ) . This is divided into 141 three points of enquiry : 1 ) tool site selection ; 2 ) tool site use ; 3 ) tool site inactivity . 142 Tool site selection explores the ecological conditions that determine where nut - cracking 143 sites are established within the chimpanzee home - range . This is critical to understanding how 144 technological activities occur within the broader behavioural landscape , and how these 145 activities produce locally discrete assemblages that can remain archaeologically identifiable 146 for thousands of years ( e . g . Falótico et al . , 2019 ; Mercader et al . , 2007 ) . There is a growing 147 body of research on habitat selection for daily activities such as foraging , travelling , socializing 148 and sleeping , particularly within the context of anthropogenic landscapes and the implications 149 for conservation ( Bryson - Morrison et al . , 2017 ; K . B . Potts et al . , 2016 ) . However , regarding 150 technological activities , although we are beginning to learn more about raw material selection 151 for tools ( S . Carvalho et al . , 2008 ; Pascual - Garrido and Almeida - Warren , 2021 ) , the selection 152 of locations for tool use remains unexplored . 153 Tool site use focuses on the ecological factors that influence the frequency with which 154 established sites attract nut - cracking activity . How often a site is used can serve as a proxy 155 for inferring preference in relation to other sites . From an archaeological perspective , generally 156 the more a location is used for debris - generating activities , the larger and more conspicuous 157 an archaeological signature becomes . This has important implications for understanding the 158 spatial clustering of activities and material evidence over time and can offer many insights into 159 7 the formation and perpetuity of early hominin archaeological assemblages ( S . Carvalho and 160 Almeida - Warren , 2019 ; McGrew , 2010 ) . Ethoarchaeological studies of chimpanzee nests 161 have found that sleeping sites are frequently revisited and the nests themselves may be 162 reused ( Hernandez - Aguilar , 2009 ; Sept , 1992 ; Stewart et al . , 2011 ) . However , comparable 163 literature on the use of tool sites is scarce , except for the reuse of stone tools ( S . Carvalho et 164 al . , 2009 ) , and sources of perishable raw materials ( Pascual - Garrido , 2018 ; Pascual - Garrido 165 and Almeida - Warren , 2021 ) . 166 Tool site inactivity investigates the ecological conditions that may cause the cessation 167 of nut - cracking activity at an established tool site . Chimpanzees live in dynamic landscapes 168 shaped by environmental change . Whether natural or anthropogenic , these shifts often result 169 in changes in resource distributions that may in turn lead to the development of new 170 behavioural adaptations and ranging patterns ( e . g . Kalan et al . , 2020 ) . New opportunities may 171 arise ( e . g . , foraging food from crops : Hockings et al . , 2015 , 2012 ; nesting in novel plant 172 species : McCarthy et al . , 2017 ) , while formerly habitual activities may shift to new locations or 173 become obsolete ( Gruber et al . , 2012 ; Kühl et al . , 2019 ) . Environmental changes have been 174 identified as important drivers of our own evolutionary history ( Bobe et al . , 2002 ; Bobe and 175 Carvalho , 2019 ; Joordens et al . , 2019 ; R . Potts , 1998 ; R . Potts et al . , 2020 ; Reed , 1997 ) , but 176 few studies have addressed empirically how these changes may have affected patterns of 177 landscape use and the distribution of early hominin tool sites ( e . g . Rogers et al . , 1994 ) . Thus , 178 investigating the conditions that influence the cessation of activity at chimpanzee tool sites , 179 can provide important clues as to the factors that lead to their temporary or long - term 180 abandonment . 181 Throughout these steps we assess the effect of ecological parameters that have been 182 found to correlate with nut - cracking activities ( nut availability ; abundance of raw materials ; 183 distance to water ) as well as variables that encapsulate two key aspects of chimpanzee activity 184 patterns : non - extractive foraging ( abundance of food resources : wild food trees ; wild fruit 185 trees ; THV - terrestrial herbaceous vegetation ) and sleeping ( distance to nesting site ) . 186 8 Methods 187 Study site and subjects 188 Bossou ( 7° 39’ N , 8° 30’ W ) is located in the southeast of the Republic of Guinea ( West 189 Africa ) , 6 km from the foothills of Mount Nimba Strict Nature Reserve ( Figure 1 ) ( Humle , 190 2011a ; Yamakoshi and Sugiyama , 1995 ) . The chimpanzee community has been studied 191 continuously in both natural ( since 1976 ) and experimental ( outdoor laboratory since 1988 ) 192 settings ( Tetsuro Matsuzawa et al . , 2011 ; Sugiyama and Koman , 1979 ) . Between 1976 and 193 2003 the population size ranged from 18 to 23 individuals ( Sugiyama , 2004 ) , but has since 194 declined largely due to a catastrophic flu - like epidemic from which it never recovered ( Humle , 195 Figure 1 – Map of the Bossou Forest and surrounding area . Mount Nimba Strict Nature Reserve shapefile adapted from the WDPA database ( UNEP - WCMC and IUCN , 2019 ) 9 2011b ; Sugiyama and Fujita , 2011 ) . At the time of this study , the population consisted of seven 196 individuals . The Bossou chimpanzees habitually crack and consume oil - palm nuts ( Elaeis 197 guineensis ) and are currently the only population known to use portable stones as both 198 hammers and anvils ( Carvalho , Matsuzawa and McGrew , 2013 ; but see Ohashi , 2015 for 199 recent discoveries in Liberia ) . Bossou has two seasons – a short dry season lasting from 200 November to February , and a long rainy season extending from March to October ( Humle , 201 2011a ; Yamakoshi , 1998 ) . Nut - cracking occurs year - round , but is most prevalent during peak 202 wet season ( June – August ) and at the start of the dry season ( November – December ) when 203 fruit is less abundant ( Yamakoshi , 1998 ) . 204 The Bossou forest has an estimated area of 16 km 2 and is intersected by roads ( Figure 205 2 ; Hockings , Anderson and Matsuzawa , 2006 ) . Within this , the chimpanzees range a core 206 Figure 2 – Map of the study area and surrounding area , highlighting the locations of recorded nut - cracking sites , quadrats , nests , and watercourses . 10 area of approximately 7 km 2 ( Hockings et al . , 2006 ) . The habitat is comprised of a composite 207 of primary , secondary and riverine forests , savanna and cultivated fields ( Hockings et al . , 208 2012 ) . The northern slope of Mont Gban , in the Eastern part of the forest , is considered a 209 sacred area – forêt sacrée – by the local Manon culture , and access is forbidden to outsiders . 210 Out of respect to this tradition , no research was conducted in this area . 211 Data collection 212 Data were collected over two field trips : 14DEC17 - 01MAY18 and 28OCT18 - 13DEC18 , 213 encompassing 160 days of fieldwork . We employed a mixed - method approach that combined 214 direct behavioural observation through active group follows of the chimpanzee population , with 215 archaeological documentation of nut - cracking sites ( indirect behavioural observations ) , and 216 ecological research using the transect and quadrat method . At an initial stage , we targeted 217 nut - cracking sites that had previously been documented by SC in 2006 and 2008 - 09 . Further 218 nut - cracking sites were discovered during surveys and group follows throughout both research 219 seasons . For each nut - cracking site we established 1 - km transects intersecting the site datum 220 at 500 metres . Nut - cracking sites within 100 metres of a pre - established transect were either 221 assigned to that transect or became the mid - point of a new perpendicular transect , to ensure 222 even forest coverage . All transects were oriented N - S or E - W , except for two that were 223 oriented NE - SW and NW - SE due to access difficulties ( Figure 2 ) . 5 - metre radius survey 224 quadrats were established at every 100 - metres along the transects starting from the midpoint 225 where the nut - cracking site was located . At each quadrat nut - cracking specific and general 226 ecological and vegetation data were collected ( further details below ) . 227 We employed a fully digital method of data collection . Quadrat datums and all data 228 entries ( food - providing vegetation , tools , raw materials ) were georeferenced using an Arrow 229 Gold GNSS receiver ( µ HRMS = 2 metres ; Almeida - Warren et al . , 2021 ; EOS Positioning 230 Systems Inc . , 2017 ) . Coordinates were instantly downloaded via Bluetooth to the GeoGrafi - M 231 11 application ( MGISS , 2019 ) on an android device where further data could be entered through 232 custom made forms . 233 Oil palms 234 For each oil palm encountered during quadrat surveys we documented diameter at 235 breast height ( DBH ) , and number of fruit bunches ( total and ripe ) . For 25 of the nut trees 236 associated to nut - cracking sites we also collected information on nut availability and new 237 traces of nut - cracking on a weekly basis during the first field season ( 22JAN18 - 03MAY18 ) and 238 once at the beginning and end of the second season ( weeks of 29OCT18 ; 10DEC18 ) . 239 Additional data was collected by Henry Camara during the weeks of 30SEP19 , 27APR20 , and 240 25MAY20 . As per Koops et al . ( 2013 ) , we scored presence of edible nuts on the ground within 241 a 2 - metre radius of the nut tree : ( 0 ) nuts absent ; ( 1 ) 1 - 50 nuts ; ( 2 ) 51 - 100 nuts ; ( 3 ) > 100 nuts . 242 With aid from field guides , nut suitability was determined by checking a sample of randomly 243 collected nuts for whether the nuts contained an edible kernel or were rotten ( following Koops 244 et al . , 2013 ) . Nuts were not opened so as not to affect future availability , but the local people 245 also crack oil palm nuts and are able to identify whether or not they are edible ( Humle and 246 Matsuzawa , 2004 ) . 247 Tools and raw materials 248 All lithic material was recorded for size , raw material type , and portability ( whether loose 249 or imbedded in the ground ) . Adapted from Koops et al . ( 2013 ) , size was scored into six 250 categories : ( 1 ) 1 - 2 cm ; ( 2 ) 3 - 5 cm ; ( 3 ) 6 - 10 cm ; ( 4 ) 11 - 20 cm ; ( 5 ) 21 - 30 cm ; ( 6 ) > 30 cm . Tools 251 and bi - products of nut - cracking were defined as stones that showed at least one of the 252 following : a ) traces of wear from nut - cracking ; b ) nutshell remains on or around them ; c ) could 253 be refitted with another stone with evidence of a ) or b ) . For this study , the variable Tools 254 included all lithic materials used for nut - cracking excluding fragments that no longer or could 255 no longer be used for nut - cracking . 256 12 The collective tool assemblage was also scored for status of nut - cracking activity : 257 ( Active ) New signs of nut - cracking activity were recorded during the fieldwork period . Nut 258 powder or cracked nut kernels were visible on top of or around tools , and there was at least 259 one hammer and anvil pair with impact points that had not rusted over ; ( Inactive ) There were 260 no signs of recent nut - cracking activity during the entire fieldwork period . Cracked nut kernels 261 were either absent or present but showed clear signs of decay . Iron oxide or moss developing 262 on tool impact points . 263 Vegetation 264 We recorded all wild non - THV plants with a DBH > 2cm of species known to be 265 consumed by the chimpanzees of Bossou . We then cross - referenced the recorded species 266 with the current list of chimpanzee food resources to identify those which were sources of fruit 267 – the preferred food - type of chimpanzees . To distinguish permanent food sources from 268 ephemeral food sources , THV was documented separately . Domesticated or crop species 269 were not included in this study . 270 Nests 271 Because few nests were documented at the quadrat level or along transects , additional 272 forest - wide surveys were conducted through random walks and strategic walks targeting 273 areas that were known nesting locations . When a nest was encountered , elevation and 274 direction of travel were maintained along topographical contours and all nests within 50 - metres 275 of the nest and either side of the projected route were documented until no further nests were 276 visible over a 50 - metre stretch ( modified from Hernandez - Aguilar , 2009 ) . For data analysis , 277 nests were divided into spatial clusters . A cluster was defined as a 50 - metre radius area with 278 a minimum of 21 documented nests , representing a minimum of three sleep - events for the 279 collective chimpanzee population ( N = 7 ) as a proxy for a habitual nesting location . This was 280 achieved on QGIS ( Version 2 . 18 . 4 ) , by creating a 50 - metre buffer zone around each nest and 281 13 using the ‘count points in polygon’ function to identify zones with a minimum of 21 nests . The 282 distance to nearest nest cluster variable used in the following analyses was computed with 283 the ‘distance to nearest hub’ function and was defined as the distance from a quadrat datum 284 to the centre of the nearest nest cluster . 285 Watercourses 286 Watercourse data was collected in 2008 / 2009 by SC . With the help of field guides , 287 streams and rivers were traced on foot and recorded using the track feature on a Garmin 288 hand - held GPS device . The distance to nearest river variable used in the following analyses 289 was computed in QGIS and was defined as the distance between a quadrat datum to the 290 nearest point along the watercourse polylines . 291 292 Data analysis 293 Tool site selection 294 Initial inspection of the data revealed that no nut - cracking occurred in quadrats where 295 nut trees were absent . This is consistent with previous literature describing that nut - cracking 296 occurs in close proximity to a nut tree ( S . Carvalho et al . , 2008 ) . Additionally , there was very 297 little variation in the number of oil palms in each quadrat with only 15 % of oil palm quadrats 298 documented with more than one oil palm . For these reasons , we restricted data analysis to 299 quadrats where an oil palm was present and did not include the number of oil palms as a 300 predictor , as this would mask the potential effect of the other variables of interest . The final 301 dataset had a total of 82 quadrats , 40 of which had traces of nut - cracking activity . We used a 302 binomial generalized linear model ( GLM ; Zuur et al . , 2009a ) with a logit link function to 303 investigate the effect of five main predictors : raw materials , wild food trees , wild food THV , 304 distance to nearest nest cluster , distance to nearest river , on the presence ( 1 ) versus absence 305 14 ( 0 ) of a tool site in a given quadrat . We also analysed three sub - models to determine whether 306 more restricted variables yielded a better model fit ( Appendix , Table A2 ) . The first sub - model 307 replaced raw materials with a subset of raw materials of size class corresponding to the three 308 most common tool size classes ( 95 % of tools . Size class : 3 , 4 , 5 ; Appendix , Table A1 ) . The 309 second sub - model replaced wild food - providing trees with a subset formed only of fruit - 310 providing trees . The third sub - model included raw materials of size class 3 - 5 and fruit - 311 providing trees . Akaike’s Information Criterion for small sample sizes ( AICc ) was used to 312 compare models ( Burnham and Anderson , 2004 ) , whereby the model with the lowest AICc 313 was chosen as the final model . 314 Tool site use 315 We investigated whether the hypothesized ecological variables ( i . e . , nut availability , raw 316 materials , food trees , distance to nearest nest cluster , and distance to nearest river ) influenced 317 the frequency a nut - cracking site was used . From a total of 361 monitoring observations , only 318 35 cases of recent nut - cracking events were identified for 17 out of the 25 monitored nut - 319 cracking sites , where frequency of recent activity ranged between 1 and 4 . Because of single 320 ( N = 1 ) sample sizes for 2 and 4 events , frequency of activity was recoded as “Low” ( ≤ 2 321 events ; N = 10 ) and “High” ( > 2 events ; N = 7 ) . The small sample size ( N = 17 ) was deemed 322 too small to justify a GL ( M ) M , therefore we only discuss descriptive statistics for this question 323 using two - sample t - tests ( or Man - Whitney U tests when assumptions of normality were not 324 met ) . 325 Tool site inactivity 326 We used a binomial GLM with ‘logit’ link to investigate the effect of mean nut availability , 327 raw materials , and food trees , on tool - site inactivity . The response variable included nut - 328 cracking sites that were classified as active ( response = 0 ; N = 24 ) with those classified as 329 inactive ( response = 1 ; N = 16 ) . The final dataset included 40 tool sites . Akin the model for 330 15 tool site selection , we also investigated four sub - models with raw materials of size class 3 - 5 , 331 tools , and fruit tree subsets ( Appendix , Table A6 ) . The model with the lowest AICc was then 332 chosen as the final model . 333 General considerations 334 All analyses were processed in R Studio ( version 1 . 1 . 383 ; R Studio Team , 2016 ) , using 335 R ( version 4 . 1 . 0 ; R Core Team , 2021 ) . Data exploration for each GLM , following the protocol 336 described in Zuur , Ieno & Elphick ( 2010 ) , did not raise any concerns . Collinearity among the 337 explanatory variables was assessed by calculating the Variance inflation factors ( VIF ) using 338 the function ‘vif’ of the car package ( Jon Fox and Weisberg , 2011 ) . None of the models 339 indicated any multicollinearity issues ( Maximum VIF = 1 . 39 , Quinn and Keough , 2002 ) . To 340 assess the significance of the full models and sub - models , we ran likelihood ratio tests ( LRT ) 341 using the ‘anova’ function which compared each model to a corresponding null model from 342 which all fixed effects were excluded ( Dobson , 2002 ) . We tested the significance of main 343 effects for each model by systematically dropping them one at a time and comparing the 344 resulting model with the full model using the ‘drop1’ function ( Dobson , 2002 ) . P - values for the 345 individual effects were based on the LRT results from the ‘drop1’ function . The AICc for model 346 selection was calculated using the ‘MuMIn’ package ( Bartón , 2020 ) . Model assumptions were 347 verified by plotting residuals versus fitted values and versus each covariate in the model ( Zuur 348 and Ieno , 2016 ) . Influential observations were assessed by calculating and plotting the Cook’s 349 distance ( Smith and Warren , 2019 ) ; all values were under the recommended threshold of 1 , 350 suggesting no evidence of influential points ( John Fox , 2002 ; Smith and Warren , 2019 ) . 351 For tool site use , comparisons between low and high frequency of nut - cracking activity 352 were computed for each of the variables of interest using unpaired two - sample t - tests or the 353 non - parametric equivalent , Wilcoxon rank - sum test ( i . e . , Mann - Whitney U test ) . Normality 354 assumptions were assessed using the Shapiro - Wilk test . Threshold for statistical significance 355 was set to p ≤ 0 . 05 . 356 16 Data availability 357 The datasets generated during and / or analysed during the current study will be available 358 from the corresponding author on reasonable request .

Efforts to ensure minimal disturbance of nut - cracking sites included : keeping 363 all tools in their original locations ; not removing or cracking nuts ; collecting stone samples from 364 existing tool fragments whenever possible . Research was conducted in accordance with all 365 the research requirements of Guinea , and the ethical protocols set out by The University of 366 Oxford , the Kyoto University Primate Research Institute , and the Institut de Recherche 367 Environmentale de Bossou ( IREB ) . 368 Results 369 Tool site selection 370 The sub - model where raw materials were replaced by a subset of size class 3 - 5 was the 371 best fitted model according to the AICc ( Appendix , Table A3 ) , and had a clear effect on the 372 probability of a nut - cracking site occurring in a location where at least one oil palm was present 373 ( full - null model comparison , LRT : df = 5 , deviance = 56 . 52 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Raw materials had a 374 significant positive effect on tool site prediction , as did food trees , while distance to nest cluster 375 had a significant negative effect ( Table 1 ; Figure 3 ) . All other fixed effects were non - significant 376 ( Table 1 ) . The sub - model replacing wild food trees with the fruit trees subset yielded the worst 377 model fit in which fruit trees were not a significant predictor ( Appendix , Table A3 , Table A4 ) . 378 379 17 Table 1 – Results of the final GLM investigating potential predictors influencing tool site 380 selection 381 Term Estimate SE χ 2 p a Intercept - 1 . 139 0 . 472 NI b Raw materials ( size class 3 - 5 ) 0 . 358 1 . 298 21 . 929 < 0 . 001 Wild food trees 0 . 313 0 . 407 5 . 758 0 . 016 THV - 0 . 103 0 . 383 0 . 392 0 . 531 Distance to nearest nest cluster - 0 . 007 0 . 485 6 . 109 0 . 013 Distance to nearest river 0 . 005 0 . 411 1 . 397 0 . 237 a Results from the likelihood ratio test using the ‘drop1’ function . b Not indicated because it has a limited interpretation . Tool site use 382 Over a total period of 15 weeks , only 33 cases of nut - cracking were recorded for 17 out 383 of 25 monitored tool sites . 10 of the 17 sites recorded one or two nut - cracking events ( low 384 Figure 3 – Probability of tool site presence in response to : a ) Raw materials of size class 3 – 5 ; b ) Trees that are sourced by chimpanzees for food ; c ) Distance to the nearest nest cluster . 18 frequency ) , with the remaining seven showing recent traces between three and four times 385 during the monitoring period ( high frequency ) . In general , mean nut availability was 386 significantly higher at nut - cracking sites that registered a higher frequency of nut - cracking 387 activity ( T - test : p = 0 . 03 ; Figure 4 ; Table A5 ) . Furthermore , distance to nearest nest cluster 388 revealed a negative trend , whereby high frequency sites tended to be nearer to nesting 389 locations ( Wilcoxon rank - sum test : p = 0 . 07 ) . For all other variables of interest ( raw materials , 390 mean fruit bunches , wild food trees and distance to nearest river ) there were no significant 391 differences between the groups ( p > 0 . 15 ; Figure 4 ; Table A5 ) . 392 393 Figure 4 – Frequency of tool site use in relative to : a ) Raw materials that have been used as tools ; b ) Distance to nearest nest cluster ( km ) ; c ) Raw materials of size class 3 to 5 ; d ) Wild trees that are sourced by chimpanzees for food ; e ) Wild trees that are sourced by chimpanzees for fruit ; f ) Distance to nearest river ( km ) .

Comparison of the tool subset model with the null model was 397 significant ( LRT : df = 3 , deviance = 13 . 20 , p < 0 . 01 ) . Overall , we found that lower values of 398 mean nut availability and a lower number of tools were both significant predictors of tool site 399 inactivity , while wild food trees had no effect ( Figure 6 ; Table 3 ) . However , the data 400 distributions shown in Figure 6 suggest that the model is not very robust . 401 402 403 Figure 6 – Probability of tool site inactivity in response to : a ) Mean nut availability ; b ) Raw materials that have been used as tools . 20 Table 3 – Results of the final GLM model investigating potential predictors influencing tool site 404 abandonment 405 Term Estimate SE χ 2 p a Intercept 2 . 957 1 . 263 NI b Mean . nut availability - 2 . 186 0 . 851 8 . 947 0 . 003 Tools - 0 . 186 0 . 093 5 . 183 0 . 023 Wild food trees 0 . 093 0 . 109 0 . 752 0 . 386 a Results from the likelihood ratio test using the ‘drop1’ function . b Not indicated because it has a limited interpretation . 406 Discussion 407 Tool site selection 408 From the initial inspection of the data , it is evident that a minimum of one oil palm , 409 specifically an oil palm in close proximity ( within 10 metres ) , is required for nut - cracking to 410 occur in a given location . Further to this , our results show that the abundance of raw materials 411 and food trees as well as proximity to the nearest nest cluster are also important predictors for 412 whether a tool site is established at an oil palm location . This suggests that , in addition to the 413 ecological pre - requisites of nut - cracking , i . e . , a producing oil palm and raw materials for tools , 414 other predictable resources that form part of the chimpanzee diet ( wild food - providing trees ) , 415 as well as non - food related activities ( sleep sites ) , are influential in the spatial distribution of 416 nut - cracking locations . In contrast , THV had a negative but non - significant effect on whether 417 tool - sites occurred . While THV is a frequently consumed food item by the chimpanzees of 418 Bossou ( Humle , 2011a ) , it differs from other wild plant foods in that they have low calorific 419 value and an individual plant often can only be sourced once , after which it is permanently 420 depleted . In contrast , food trees are replenishable , often seasonally , and constitute reliable 421 and predictable resources that can be returned to on a seasonal basis . The fact that THV does 422 21 not bear a clear effect on tool site occurrence suggests that unpredictable food sources are 423 not ecological drivers of tool site selection . 424 Previous research has found that many primate species have goal - orientated foraging 425 trajectories towards spatially permanent resources and that they likely use mental maps to 426 guide their resource exploitation strategies ( Trapanese et al . , 2019 ) . Our results provide 427 tentative evidence that the chimpanzees of Bossou may behave in a similar way , whereby 428 nut - cracking activities take place within a foraging strategy that primarily targets predictable , 429 high - value foods , while low - energy unpredictable foods like THV act as part of an opportunistic 430 strategy during forage - on - the - go . 431 Distance to nearest nest cluster was a significant predictor in all models , whereby the 432 likelihood of a tool site occurring increased with proximity to nest locations . Previous research 433 has found that nests sites occur in areas of high food availability ( Basabose and Yamagiwa , 434 2002 ; J . S . Carvalho et al . , 2015 ; Furuichi and Hashimoto , 2004 ; Goodall , 1962 ; Janmaat et 435 al . , 2014 ) . Given that nut - cracking sites are also located in areas with a greater number of 436 food providing trees , and bearing in mind that the Bossou chimpanzees source oil palms for a 437 range or other resources ( e . g . fruit , pith , palm heart ) and also nest in their crowns ( Humle and 438 Matsuzawa , 2001 , 2004 ; Yamakoshi and Sugiyama , 1995 ) , it is possible that the relationship 439 between nut - cracking sites , proximity to nest sites , and food availability , is indicative that these 440 areas are activity hotspots , rich in resources and with habitat characteristics that are suitable 441 for a range of core chimpanzee activities . 442 Distance to the nearest river was not a significant predictor in any of the models . This 443 contradicts previous research in the nearby forest of Diecké , that identified that nut - cracking 444 locations occurred near waterlines ( S . Carvalho et al . , 2007 ) . Emerging research on the role 445 and importance of water in shaping primate behaviour , adaptations , and landscape use , is 446 providing increasing evidence that there are differences in water - dependence between 447 populations . Rainforest - dwelling apes can usually obtain their daily hydration requirements 448 from the food they consume , and can go several days without drinking ( Pontzer et al . , 2021 ) . 449 However , for primates that live in year - round or seasonally arid landscapes water is a critical 450 22 resource that shapes movement patterns and landscape use ( Barton et al . , 1992 ; Pruetz and 451 Herzog , 2017 ; Wessling et al . , 2018 ) . Fongoli chimpanzees usually drink water at least once 452 a day and often spend time near water sources during dry months to stay cool ( Wessling , 453 pers . comm . ; Pruetz and Bertolani , 2009 ) . Conversely , the Bossou forest is much more humid , 454 with a long - wet season . It’s many streams , and small forest area provide a hydrological 455 landscape in which chimpanzees are rarely more than 300 metres away from water . 456 Furthermore , during a total of ~ 500 hours of focal follows , the Bossou chimpanzees were only 457 seen to drink water on eight occasions , suggesting that they can get most of their fluids from 458 the foods they consume , in line with the general trend for non - human apes ( Pontzer et al . , 459 2021 ) . 460 While water was not a significant factor for Bossou , we predict that it could be a major 461 ecological driver regarding the spatial distribution and reuse of tool sites by savannah - living 462 chimpanzees . The Fongoli chimpanzees do not crack nuts , but they engage in termite - fishing , 463 which is also a spatially discrete technological activity tethered to the location of termite 464 mounds ( Bogart and Pruetz , 2008 , 2011 ) , much like nut - cracking . 465 Nevertheless , climatic or hydrological differences cannot explain the differences 466 between Bossou and Diecké . Given the proximity of both field sites ( approx . 50 km ) and similar 467 climates it is unlikely that this is due to differences in aridity or water availability . However , the 468 chimpanzees of Diecké crack different nut species , Panda oleosa and Coula edulis , which are 469 absent in Bossou and may be more water dependent than the oil palm . Thus , this discrepancy 470 may be connected to the different plant species exploited and their respective ecology and 471 distribution . 472 Tool site use 473 Number of tools was the only variable of interest that differed significantly between sites 474 with low or high frequency of nut - cracking events . This could indicate that the visible traces of 475 nut - cracking found on tools act as visual cues for stimulating further nut - cracking behaviour . 476 23 The repeated use of discrete locations through stigmergy has been suggested to have led the 477 emergence of persistent places during the Middle Pleistocene ( Matthew Pope et al . , 2006 ; 478 Matthew Pope , 2017 ; Shaw et al . , 2016 ) . Similar hypotheses featuring local and stimulus 479 enhancement in chimpanzees have also been discussed as processes of social learning ( e . g . 480 in the development of technical skills ; Musgrave et al . , 2020 ; Tennie et al . , 2020 ; Whiten , 481 2021 ) as well why some plants are sourced more intensively than others for the manufacture 482 of termite fishing tools ( Almeida - Warren et al . , 2017 ) . Conversely , it could indicate that 483 chimpanzees prefer sites with material that they are already familiar with . Previous research 484 in Bossou has demonstrated that chimpanzees reuse hammer - anvil pairs ( tool - sets ) more 485 often than others , that there is both group - and individual - level preference for certain tool - sets 486 ( S . Carvalho et al . , 2009 ) , and that chimpanzees are selective of the types of materials they 487 use for nut - cracking ( S . Carvalho et al . , 2008 ) . Analogous studies on chimpanzee plant 488 technologies , suggests similar patterns in the selection of materials for termite - fishing , ant - 489 dipping , honey gathering and water extraction ( Almeida - Warren et al . , 2017 ; Lamon et al . , 490 2018 ; Pascual - Garrido et al . , 2012 ; Pascual - Garrido and Almeida - Warren , 2021 ) . 491 Distance to nearest nest cluster showed a weak yet noteworthy difference , whereby the 492 frequency of nut - cracking events was marginally greater at tool sites that were closer to nest 493 locations . These results mirror those found for tool - site selection and offer further tentative 494 support that active tool sites and their frequency of use is influenced by their distribution 495 relative to current activity hotspots . 496 The number of wild food and fruit trees was largely the same for all active nut - cracking 497 sites . This suggest that , while food providing trees are good indicators of tool - site selection , 498 they may not good predictors of site use because the data collected did not capture temporal 499 changes in food availability or frequency of foraging activity . On the other hand , nests are 500 temporary features that rarely preserve for longer than six months in non - savannah 501 environments ( Ihobe , 2005 ; Kamgang et al . , 2020 ; Zamma and Makelele , 2012 ) . Therefore , 502 they are a better spatial proxy for recent ranging patterns and possibly explains why 503 differences were found for nests , but not for vegetation . 504 24 Some consideration needs to be given as to the low number of weekly traces of nut - 505 cracking events recorded per tool site during the 15 - weeks of monitoring . This is partially due 506 to the fact that not all active tool sites were monitored , with a further seven traces were found 507 through indirect observations at non - monitored sites . Our data indicates that a minimum of 40 508 nut - cracking events took place at natural nut - cracking sites during the 15 week monitoring 509 period , averaging approximately three events per week , which may be sufficient for the 510 existing chimpanzee population . 511 Furthermore , out of the nine nut - cracking events witnessed during group follows , six 512 took place at the outdoor laboratory , where nuts and stones were being artificially provisioned 513 for another project . The outdoor laboratory is located at the intersection of several routes which 514 the chimpanzees frequently travel through to access different parts of the forest . As a location 515 that has always experienced a high degree of natural thoroughfare ( Tetsuro Matsuzawa , 516 2011 ) , it may represent a pre - existing activity hotspot that has been enhanced by the 517 guaranteed encounter of tools and edible nuts . This could explain why a comparatively higher 518 number of nut - cracking events were observed there , similar to patterns recorded by Hockings 519 et al . ( 2009 ) . 520 Nevertheless , due to small sample sizes and the limitations of the statistics employed , 521 more data are needed to explore these hypotheses further . For future research , it would be 522 important to investigate over a longer timescale whether and how often chimpanzees visited 523 the part of the forest where the tool site is located . This could make the use of complementary 524 data from camera traps placed in strategic locations , as full - day focal follows are not permitted 525 in Bossou . 526 Tool site inactivity 527 Understanding the contexts of tool site inactivity is an important step in investigating the 528 conditions required for nut - cracking to occur and persist over time in a particular location , and 529 the factors that might lead to their abandonment . Our data suggests that mean nut availability , 530 25 used as a proxy for tree productivity , and a high abundance of tools are important in 531 maintaining the active status of a nut - cracking site . However , there are clear exceptions that 532 appear to not quite fit the model ( Figure 6 ) , suggesting that other factors that were not 533 considered in the analysis may also be at play . 534 The Bossou forest suffers from a great deal of human activity , particularly slash - and - 535 burn agriculture , which leads to frequent and rapid changes in the spatial distribution of 536 resources and localized vegetation composition ( Hockings , 2011 ) . While oil palms are not cut 537 down during this process and are highly resistant to fire ( Yamakoshi , 2011 ) , the changes in 538 the surrounding landscape and the increase in human presence may deter chimpanzees from 539 visiting those areas , especially if they are near the forest boundary . Conversely , cultivated 540 land that contains desirable food items ( e . g . banana , mango , papaya ) can often attract 541 chimpanzees ( Hockings , 2011 ) , and perhaps , under these conditions , the chimpanzees 542 prioritize the prized fruit over nuts that can be found almost anywhere . Site inactivity could 543 also be an artefact of population decline , whereby fewer resources are sufficient to sustain the 544 entire population . Previous literature has suggested that the Bossou forest has a carrying 545 capacity for around 20 chimpanzees ( Sugiyama and Fujita , 2011 ) , so it is possible that the 546 current population may no longer need to depend as highly on nuts to supplement their diets . 547 A future longitudinal comparison drawing from historical and contemporary data will help 548 investigate and test this further . 549 Conclusions 550 Our results indicate that proximity to a nut tree , an abundance of raw materials and 551 predictable resources , as well as proximity to a nesting site are important ecological 552 parameters for the establishment of a nut - cracking site in a given location . Distance to nearest 553 nest cluster was also correlated with frequency of nut - cracking , which could potentially indicate 554 that nesting sites are important anchors for ranging and activity patterns . Similarly , tool 555 availability was significantly correlated with tool site use , as well as tool site inactivity , suggests 556 26 that familiarity of materials used for tools or the visual cues of tool use could be important in 557 the persistence of nut - cracking activities once a site has been established . While there was 558 no significant difference in nut availability among oil palms at active sites , the odds of tool site 559 inactivity were greater when mean nut availability was low , potentially indicating that a decline 560 in oil palm productivity at nut - cracking sites is driver of sites disuse . Together , these results 561 postulate that nut - cracking in Bossou is not only tethered to locations that provide the 562 necessary resources for this activity but is also intimately connected to a broader foraging and 563 behavioural landscape that is mediated by the spatio - temporal availability of primary target 564 resources , such as predictable food - providing trees , as well as the distribution of frequently 565 used nesting locations . 566 Preliminary comparisons with other sites regarding the importance of ecological features 567 such as the effect of water on tool use and ranging patterns , suggests that the ecology of 568 chimpanzee technology is context - specific and should be examined with this in mind . Further 569 studies investigating the technological landscapes of other chimpanzee populations , as well 570 as the integration of long - term data , will help better understand the effect of different 571 environmental and demographic contexts on the factors driving the spatial distribution and 572 reuse of tool sites , adding further detail to this picture . 573 While current evidence suggests that early hominin and chimpanzee lithic technologies 574 differ in form and function ( Arroyo and de la Torre , 2016 ; Toth et al . , 2006 ) , it is likely they had 575 similar plant - dominated diets supported by insects and sporadic meat consumption ( Panger 576 et al . , 2003 ) . Thus , it is plausible that , like chimpanzees , early hominin tool - use operated within 577 behavioural landscapes conditioned by localized environmental parameters , where foraging 578 strategies were shaped by the distribution and availability of predictable food sources , the 579 dietary dependence on extractive foraging and the availability of the necessary raw materials , 580 as well as the location of safe places for sleeping . With the aid of primate archaeological 581 inference , visualizing the spatial distribution of hominin lithic assemblages within this 582 framework will be instrumental in providing crucial insights for reconstructing the patterns of 583 landscape use and resource exploitation . 584 27 The present study suggests that the technological landscape of the chimpanzees of 585 Bossou shares affinities with the ‘favoured places’ model ( Schick and Toth , 1993 ; Shick , 586 1987 ) , which proposed that hominin tool sites formed at the centre of foraging areas where 587 hominins would process and consume food , rest and socialize , with sites being used more 588 intensively in areas with higher resource abundance . Such ‘activity hotspots’ would have acted 589 as ecological tethers , shaping early hominin movement and foraging patterns , which , in turn , 590 would have led to the formation and repeated use of tool sites over time . As the most 591 conspicuous evidence of these locations , stone tool assemblages may hold important clues 592 for uncovering behaviours beyond those associated to lithic technology and serve as starting 593 points to search for traces of other activities , such as sleeping , foraging , and insectivory , that 594 are currently extremely rare in the archaeological record . This research draws upon the work 595 of Glynn Isaac ( e . g . Isaac , 1981 ; Isaac et al . , 1981 ; Isaac and Harris , 1980 ) who pioneered 596 the application of landscape - scale approaches to the study of hominin assemblages , from 597 which the first concrete models of hominin site formation were developed . Further studies will 598 help guide future human origins research and provide an empirical framework for modelling 599 and testing hypotheses of early hominin behaviour associated to the archaeological record of 600 our earliest ancestors . 601 Acknowledgements 602 We are grateful to Vincent Mamy , Lawe Goigbe , Boniface Zogbila , Gouanou Zogbila , 603 Jules Doré , Henry Camara , and Pascal Goumi for support in the field ; Dr .
