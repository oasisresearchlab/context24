Drubin 1 , 4 clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( cMe ) is the best - studied pathway by which cells selectively internalize molecules from the plasma membrane and surrounding environment . previous live - cell imaging studies using ectopically overexpressed fluorescent fusions of endocytic proteins indicated that mammalian cMe is a highly dynamic but inefficient and heterogeneous process . in contrast , studies of endocytosis in budding yeast using fluorescent protein fusions expressed at physiological levels from native genomic loci have revealed a process that is very regular and efficient . to analyse endocytic dynamics in mammalian cells in which endogenous protein stoichiometry is preserved , we targeted zinc finger nucleases ( ZFns ) to the clathrin light chain a and dynamin - 2 genomic loci and generated cell lines expressing fluorescent protein fusions from each locus . the genome - edited cells exhibited enhanced endocytic function , dynamics and efficiency when compared with previously studied cells , indicating that cMe is highly sensitive to the levels of its protein components . our study establishes that ZFn - mediated genome editing is a robust tool for expressing protein fusions at endogenous levels to faithfully report subcellular localization and dynamics . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is characterized by recruitment of clathrin triskelia , composed of heavy and light chains , to the plasma membrane and their assembly into polygonal cages that mediate mem - brane invagination . During late stages of this process the GTPase dynamin is recruited to the necks of these invaginations 1 , where it functions in vesicle release through membrane scission and the sub - sequent internalization of plasma - membrane molecules , extracellular fluid and specific ligands from the environment 2 , 3 . Three decades of evidence directly connect perturbation of CME to a broad range of pathophysiological outcomes , including atherosclerosis 4 , disorders of the peripheral and central nervous system 5 and infection by the hepatitis C virus 6 . The study of CME has been greatly advanced through the use of fluorescent fusion proteins 7 . In yeast , direct genomic tagging of pairs of genes with different fluorescent tags has allowed researchers to define a very regular series of spatiotemporal events for CME in living cells 8 . Conversely , in mammalian cells these events have been described as being much more heterogeneous and inefficient 9 – 12 , but the inability to do precise genome editing has forced researchers to rely heavily on overexpression of fusion proteins 1 , 9 – 14 . Furthermore , these fusion pro - teins are often derived from a different cell type or species from the cell type being studied , and encode non - native splice variants . An accurate description of endocytic dynamics is the foundation for understanding the mechanism and regulation of this crucial process . Because evidence from fields ranging from developmental and cell biology to plant physi - ology has shown that overexpression can result in protein mislocaliza - tion , aggregation and altered signalling 15 – 20 , we sought to re - examine the highly dynamic process of CME using fluorescent fusion proteins expressed from their native loci . reSUltS ZFn - mediated editing as an efficient and accurate method for generating stable cell lines expressing fluorescent protein fusions from native loci To engineer precise gene fusions at endogenous loci , we used zinc finger nucleases ( ZFNs ) 21 designed to cleave their target genes near the stop codons . The resulting double - strand breaks were mended by homology - directed repair using an exogenously supplied DNA donor that encodes a fluorescent tag ( Fig . 1a ) . In all cases , ZFNs and donor constructs were co - transfected into the cells . The high - editing efficiency and accuracy of the open reading frame ( ORF ) addition process , coupled with the expression of proteins bearing fluorescent markers , allowed us to obtain the desired cells simply by using fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) without drug selection ( Supplementary Fig . S1a and Table S1 , top ) . Single - cell - derived clones were then generated by limiting dilution . We found that ZFN treatment had a negligible impact on cell survival ( Supplementary 1 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology , University of California Berkeley , Berkeley , California 94720 , USA . 2 Sangamo BioSciences , Incorporated , Richmond , California 94804 , USA . 3 These authors contributed equally to this work . 4 Correspondence should be addressed to D .

ZFn - mediated insertion of rFp at the CLTA locus in monkey cells We designed ZFNs targeting the 3ʹ - terminus of clathrin light chain A ( CLTA ; Fig . 1a and Supplementary Table S2 ) and first used them in African green monkey kidney epithelial cells ( BSC - 1 ) , which have been used for many important studies of endocytic dynamics 10 , 11 , 22 , 23 . We generated a cell line , mkCLTA EN , in which one CLTA allele was tagged with red fluorescent protein ( RFP ; Table 1 and Supplementary Fig . S1c and Table S1 , bottom ) . Genotyping and western blot analysis con - firmed the accurate addition of the tag to the CLTA locus ( Fig . 1b , c and Supplementary Fig . S2a ) . As expected , mkCLTA EN cells demonstrated punctate plasma membrane and perinuclear CLTA – RFP distribution ( Fig . 1d and Supplementary Fig . S3a ) , and complete co - localization of CLTA – RFP with clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ; Supplementary Fig . S3b ) , indicating that the endogenously tagged CLTA is correctly incorporated into clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) . Genome - edited clta – rFp monkey cells exhibit increased cMe dynamics and function relative to overexpression lines Numerous reports have documented striking heterogeneity in the size , dynamics and productivity of CCPs 10 – 12 , yet the nature of this heteroge - neity and its functional implications have not been established . Because determining the time required to form coated pits and vesicles is critical for gaining a mechanistic and regulatory understanding of CME 11 , 22 – 24 , we sought to quantitatively analyse clathrin dynamics in mkCLTA EN cells using total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy and semi - automated particle tracking . Analysis of a well - studied BSC - 1 - derived cell line ( rCLTA X , Table 1 ) , which overexpresses rat brain CLTA fused to green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) from a randomly integrated transgene 12 , yielded an overall mean lifetime for the fusion protein at the plasma membrane of 46 ± 2 . 2 s ( Fig . 1e and Supplementary Fig .

Strikingly , analysis of the endogenously tagged mkCLTA EN cell line revealed a significantly shorter mean lifetime ( 25 ± 0 . 9 s , P < 0 . 0001 ; Fig . 1e and Supplementary Fig . S4a , Table S3 and Movie S2 ) . Our single - allele tagged , genome - edited cell lines exhibited consid - erably dimmer fluorescent structures than the stable overexpression cell lines . As such , we were concerned that this decreased fluorescence might affect our ability to faithfully quantify endocytic protein dynam - ics . To address this concern , we conducted two tests of the effects of low fluorescence signal on our lifetime measurements . First , we determined whether the measured lifetime for an overexpression line is affected by decreasing the exposure time . Whether the rCLTA X cell line was ana - lysed with an exposure time of 900 ms ( as used in this study ) or 30 ms ( to simulate low fluorescence ) , similar mean lifetimes of 46 ± 2 . 2 s and 51 ± 6 . 3 s , respectively , were obtained . Second , we predicted that if we are faithfully measuring the lifetimes of low - fluorescence structures in the single - allele edited lines , then their arrival and disappearance at individual endocytic sites should be coincident with those of the same protein fused to a different tag , and expressed in the same cell . Indeed , when we transiently overexpressed human CLTA fused to GFP in the hCLTA EN – 1 cell line ( expressing CLTA – RFP ) , we found that , despite the low fluorescence of the endogenous CLTA – RFP , its arrival and disap - pearance were coincident with those of CLTA – GFP ( data not shown ) . These data collectively demonstrate that the observed shorter mean life - times of our single - allele genome - edited lines , compared with all - allele edited and overexpression lines , were not the result of a decreased ability to detect clathrin for its entire membrane lifetime . To address whether the species ( rat versus monkey ) and splice vari - ant of rCLTA X could account for the discrepancy in CCP lifetimes , we generated a stable overexpression BSC - 1 cell line ( mkCLTA X ; Table 1 ) in which the major endogenously expressed mkCLTA splice variant was fused to RFP . Relative to the endogenously tagged mkCLTA EN cell line , CLTA was overexpressed 3 . 5 - fold in mkCLTA X and 5 . 7 - fold in rCLTA X cells ( Fig . 1c and Supplementary Fig . S2a ) . mkCLTA X cells had an average CLTA – RFP lifetime of 35 ± 2 . 4 s—a value significantly longer than that of the mkCLTA EN line ( P < 0 . 05 ; Fig . 1e and Supplementary Fig . S4a , Table S3 , and Movie S3 ) —indicating that protein overexpres - sion increases CCP lifetime . Moreover , mkCLTA EN cells showed robust uptake of transferrin ( a CME cargo ) , similar to that of control cells , with intense perinuclear accumulation . By contrast , the transferrin distribu - tion was more diffuse in mkCLTA X cells , suggesting a diminished rate of internalization ( Fig . 1f ) . These results indicate that overexpression of CLTA can also negatively impact endocytic function and are consist - ent with previous studies implicating clathrin light chains as negative regulators of CME 7 , 23 , 25 . Collectively , these findings demonstrate a more faithful representation of CME than was achieved using previous meth - ods requiring overexpression and highlight the importance of studying the dynamics of proteins at physiological expression levels . Genome - edited clta – rFp human cells exhibit increased cMe dynamics and function To test the generality of these results , we used the same ZFN pair to gen - erate a human skin melanoma cell line , SK - MEL - 2 , in which CLTA was tagged with RFP at its native locus . Genotyping and western blot analy - sis confirmed the precise addition of the tag to the CLTA locus , yielding both single - allele tagged ( hCLTA EN – 1 ) and all - allele tagged ( hCLTA EN – all ) cell lines ( Fig . 2a , b , Table 1 and Supplementary Fig . S2b ) . Importantly , hCLTA EN – all cells showed complete co - localization of CLTA – RFP with CHC ( Supplementary Fig . S3c ) . Analysis of hCLTA EN – 1 revealed a mean CLTA – RFP lifetime ( 44 ± 3 . 1 s ) that was significantly shorter than the lifetime in a cell line overexpressing the same CLTA – RFP fusion ( hCLTA X ; 63 ± 2 . 9 s , P < 0 . 001 ; Fig . 2c and Supplementary Fig . S4b , Table S3 and Movies S4 and S5 ) . Notably , analysis of the homozygous hCLTA EN – all cell line revealed large , stable clathrin - coated structures at the plasma membrane that were not seen in the isogenic heterozygous line . We also observed diffraction - limited CCPs in hCLTA EN – all cells , and their analysis yielded an intermediate CLTA – RFP mean lifetime of 52 ± 2 . 0 s ( Fig . 2c and Supplementary Fig . S4b , Table S3 and Movie S6 ) . Finally , we found that hCLTA EN cells maintain robust transferrin uptake , similar to control cells , whereas the overexpression hCLTA X cell line exhibited diminished endocytic function ( Fig . 2d , e ) . Taken together , our data from isogenic cells in two different species support two major conclusions : CME in mammalian cells is a significantly more dynamic process than previously thought , and increasing fusion protein levels has a detrimental effect on CCP dynamics and endocytic function . ZFn - mediated insertion of GFp at the DNM2 locus in human cells reveals unprecedented dynamics We next sought to address whether overexpression might affect the native dynamics of another CME factor , dynamin - 2 ( DNM2 ) . Previous studies on the dynamics of dynamin fluorescent protein fusions required examination of cells with a low level of overexpression , shortly Table 1 Cell lines used in this study Cell lines with marker ORFs added to the endogenous locus Designation Cell line Species Gene Marker mkCLTA EN BSC - 1 Cercopithecus aethiops monkey CLTA ( clathrin light chain A ) RFP hCLTA EN SK - MEL - 2 Homo sapiens human CLTA ( clathrin light chain A ) RFP hDNM2 EN SK - MEL - 2 Homo sapiens human DNM2 ( dynamin 2 ) GFP hCLTA EN / DNM2 EN SK - MEL - 2 Homo sapiens human CLTA , DNM2 RFP / GFP Cell lines carrying overexpressed , randomly integrated marker ORFs Designation Cell line Species Gene Marker rCLTA X BSC - 1 Cercopithecus aethiops rat brain CLTA ( clathrin light chain A ) GFP mkCLTA X BSC - 1 Cercopithecus aethiops monkey CLTA ( clathrin light chain A ) RFP hCLTA X SK - MEL - 2 Homo sapiens human CLTA ( clathrin light chain A ) RFP hDNM2 X SK - MEL - 2 Homo sapiens human DNM2 ( dynamin 2 ) GFP nature cell biology advance online publication 3 t e c h n i c a l Re p oR t after transfection ( 14 – 16 h ) , because high levels of overexpression at longer intervals resulted in the appearance of large , stationary struc - tures 12 , 24 . We created SK - MEL - 2 cell lines in which one ( hDNM2 EN – 1 ) or all ( hDNM2 EN – all ) endogenous DNM2 alleles were tagged with GFP ( Fig . 3a , Table 1 and Supplementary Fig . S1a , d ) and compared them with a cell line overexpressing the identical DNM2 – GFP fusion that was generated from a randomly integrated transgene ( hDNM2 X ; Table 1 ) . The hDNM2 EN lines were shown by genotyping and pheno - typic analysis to express physiological levels of fusion protein ( Fig . 3b , c and Supplementary Fig . S2c ) that localized as punctate structures on the plasma membrane ( Fig . 3d ) . Consistent with previous reports 12 , 24 , our attempts to generate sta - ble overexpression hDNM2 X cell lines by random transgene insertion resulted in cells that exhibited bright , irregular and highly stable dynamin structures . This made it impossible , as previously reported 11 – 12 , 22 – 24 , to implement a global and unbiased analysis of DNM2 plasma membrane dynamics in these lines . In striking contrast , the genome - edited lines exhibited highly dynamic DNM2 – GFP localization , allowing us to globally quantify their lifetimes . The single - allele - tagged hDNM2 EN – 1 cell line exhibited significantly shorter average lifetimes than isogenic hDNM2 EN – all cells : 24 ± 1 . 0 s versus 36 ± 2 . 1 s ( P < 0 . 0001 ; Fig . 3e and Supplementary Fig . S4c , Table S3 , and Movies S7 and S8 ) . Furthermore , hDNM2 X - overexpressing cells had diminished endocytic function when compared with the endogenously tagged cell lines ( Fig . 3f ) . Thus , simi - larly to CLTA , DNM2 dynamics and function are highly sensitive to protein expression level and tagging . Simultaneous tagging of CLTA and DNM2 reveals that mammalian cMe is highly efficient In budding yeast , direct genomic tagging of pairs of genes encoding endo - cytic proteins with different fluorescent tags has implicated > 60 proteins in CME and has allowed researchers to define , in detail , a very regular series of spatiotemporal events 8 . To generate mammalian cells possessing tagged forms of CLTA and DNM2 in a single cell , we co - delivered ZFNs and donors for both CLTA and DNM2 and used FACS to isolate a pool of double - marker - positive cells . We isolated a single - cell - derived clone with one copy of CLTA tagged with RFP and all copies of DNM2 tagged with GFP ( hCLTA EN / DNM2 EN ; Fig . 4a , b , Table 1 and Supplementary Fig . S2d ) . To our knowledge , this represents the first example in human somatic cell genetics of a cell carrying tags at two distinct endogenous non - allelic loci . Similarly to the individually tagged cell lines ( Supplementary Table S3 ) , the measured lifetimes of CLTA and DNM2 in this dual - tagged cell line were 45 ± 1 . 0 s and 32 ± 3 . 3 s , respectively . As expected 1 , DNM2 was robustly recruited to clathrin - intense plasma membrane puncta in the final moments of CCP maturation ( Fig . 5a , b and Supplementary Movie S9 ) . 0 10 20 30 40 50 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 M ea n fl u o r e s ce n ce ( a . u . ) Time ( min ) e 45 min 30 min 15 min 5 min d * * * M ea n li f e t i m e ( s ) # 70 65 60 55 50 45 40 35 c RFP 55 - 35 - CLTA CLTA – RFP C o n t r o l Actin b CLTA – RFP CLTA C o n t r o l SK - MEL - 2 a M r ( K ) C o n t r o l h C L T A E N – 1 h C L T A X h C L T A E N – 1 h C L T A E N - a ll h C L T A E N – 1 h C L T A E N - a ll h C L T A E N – 1 h C L T A E N - a ll h C L T A X h C L T A X Figure 2 Editing of CLTA using ZFNs in SK - MEL - 2 cells .

Previous efforts to define the percentage of productive clathrin - coated structures have relied on inference - based statistical analysis of popula - tion lifetimes in several overexpression cell lines , yielding CME effi - ciency estimates of 40 % ( refs 11 , 22 , 23 ) . As dynamin is required for clathrin - coated vesicle scission at the plasma membrane , the hCLTA EN / DNM2 EN line allowed us to monitor clathrin and dynamin dynamics simultaneously in a global and unbiased manner and to use dynamin as a marker to directly measure CCP productivity . To our surprise , 91 % ( n = 276 CCPs ) of disappearing clathrin puncta in our genome - edited cells displayed bright peaks of dynamin recruitment , suggesting that most CME events are productive ( Fig . 5c , left panel ) . By contrast , cells overexpressing both CLTA – RFP and DNM2 – GFP displayed extensive , large stationary dynamin - containing clathrin - coated structures ( Fig . 5c , right panel ) . This result suggests that CME efficiency in mammals and yeast is more similar than was previously appreciated . DiScUSSion Significant advances in our understanding of endocytosis have been made by generating cell lines carrying overexpressed transgenes encod - ing fluorescent protein fusions 1 , 2 , 9 – 14 , 22 – 29 . Although such studies have provided unique and powerful insights into understanding endocytic mechanisms and regulation , the impact of fusion protein overexpression on proper endocytic function was unclear . We found that the dynam - ics and function of both clathrin and dynamin in two different species ( monkey and human ) are significantly impaired by overexpression . We expect the same phenomenon to be true for many other proteins , includ - ing those that have multiple interaction partners and / or regulate rate - limiting steps in biosynthetic or signalling pathways . In this study , we performed ZFN - mediated genome editing in mam - malian cells to create precise , in - frame fluorescent protein fusions at the genomic loci of endocytic proteins . In yeast cells , where construction of precise protein fusions at genomic loci has long been routine for expres - sion of fluorescent protein fusions at endogenous levels , endocytosis has been described as a very regular process . The predictable timing and ordering of endocytic protein recruitment in yeast have allowed for detailed descriptions of the timing of events in the endocytic pathway C o n t r o l h D N M 2 E N – 1 h D N M 2 E N – 1 h D N M 2 E N - a ll 5 30 Time ( min ) h D N M 2 X h D N M 2 X f ND * * * 50 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 DNM2 – GFP hDNM2 EN – 1 hDNM2 EN - all d 130 - 100 - c C o n t r o l h D N M 2 E N – 1 h D N M 2 E N - a ll C o n t r o l h D N M 2 E N – 1 h D N M 2 E N - a ll h D N M 2 X b ATG TAG DNM2 Exon 21 GFP Exon 22 (cid:42)(cid:36)(cid:38)(cid:55)(cid:36)(cid:42)(cid:42)(cid:38)(cid:17)(cid:42)(cid:42)(cid:42)(cid:42)(cid:42)(cid:42)(cid:42)(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:55)(cid:38)(cid:36)(cid:38)(cid:42)(cid:38)(cid:36)(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:42)(cid:38)(cid:42)(cid:42)(cid:38)(cid:42)(cid:38)(cid:36)(cid:42)(cid:42)(cid:36)(cid:42)(cid:38)(cid:55)(cid:55)(cid:38)(cid:36)(cid:42)(cid:55)(cid:42)(cid:42)(cid:55)(cid:39)(cid:3)(cid:17)(cid:38)(cid:55)(cid:42)(cid:36)(cid:55)(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:42)(cid:17)(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:42)(cid:42)(cid:36)(cid:42)(cid:55)(cid:42)(cid:38)(cid:42)(cid:55)(cid:42)(cid:42)(cid:42)(cid:38)(cid:42)(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:42)(cid:38)(cid:42)(cid:55)(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:55)(cid:38)(cid:42)(cid:36)(cid:36)(cid:42)(cid:55)(cid:38)(cid:36)(cid:38)(cid:38)(cid:36) ZFN - DNM2 - R ZFN - DNM2 - L 20 bp ZFN target Donor a Right HA Left HA M r ( K ) DNM2 – GFP DNM2 DNM2 – GFP DNM2 GFP Actin M ea n li f e t i m e ( s ) e Figure 3 Editing of DNM2 using ZFNs in SK - MEL - 2 cells .

By contrast , reports of variability in the size and dynamic behaviour of clathrin structures in mammalian cells have raised questions about the underlying biological significance of the different populations and about the regulatory mechanisms responsible for this heterogeneity . Furthermore , this heterogeneity has limited the ability to perform a global analysis of protein dynamics to detect the phenotypes that are caused when endocytic protein functions are impaired . Our data suggest that conventional overexpression - based methods in mammalian cells contribute to heterogeneity in the size and dynamics of clathrin - coated structures , thus warranting the use of genome - edited cells for re - examination of the effects of cargo , cell physiology and function - perturbing manipulations on endocytic dynamics and productivity . ZFN - mediated genome editing has several advantages over conven - tional methods for generating cell lines that stably express fluorescent fusion proteins . First , conventional methods require selection of a single splice variant for study and , consequently , dominant expression of a sin - gle isoform . Moreover , these methods result in transgene overexpression , leading to total protein levels ( comprising both tagged and untagged forms ) that are significantly higher than in wild - type cells . Although transient overexpression methods can generate cells that express a fusion protein closer to physiological levels , they often result in heterogene - ous cell - to - cell protein expression levels , necessitating experimental bias in the selection of ‘low - expression’ cells for study . By contrast , a ZFN - mediated strategy allows for creation of single - or multiple - allele tagged cell lines for greater control of a tagged protein’s expression level . Furthermore , our tagging strategy preserves native RNA splicing , ena - bling the analysis of protein isoforms at physiological stoichiometry and levels . Although such an approach precludes an analysis of individual splice variants , alternative ZFNs and donors could be readily designed to achieve exclusive expression of a desired isoform at endogenous levels . Although the need to perturb a biological process to observe it is a general shortcoming of experimental research , we believe that our studies strike a balance between modifying a cell to faithfully report on its biology and retaining its natural state . In particular , the ability to engineer isogenic human cells using ZFN technology 21 , 30 , 31 in a manner that has been the gold standard in budding and fission yeast for decades has the potential to transform the way that researchers study dynamic processes .

ZFNs designed to cleave precisely at or in the immediate vicinity of the stop codons of CLTA and DNM2 were assem - bled using an archive of pre - validated zinc finger modules 32 – 34 . All ZFNs carried enhanced obligate heterodimer ( eHF ) alleles of the FokI endonuclease 35 : Q486E / I499L / N496D and E490K / I538K / H537R . ZFNs were pre - screened for activity in K562 and SK - MEL - 2 cells using Surveyor nuclease ( Cel - 1 , Transgenomic ) 33 to detect insertions and deletions of DNA segments ( indels ) . Briefly , Accuprime Taq HiFi ( Invitrogen ) was used with the Cel - 1 primers listed in Supplementary Table S4 to amplify a short region surrounding the ZFN - target site in a 28 - cycle PCR . Resulting amplicons were denatured , slowly re - annealed , and treated with Cel - 1 for 20 min at 42 °C , then separated on 10 % criterion gels ( Bio - Rad ) and visualized by ethidium - bromide staining . Out - out PCR to detect targeted integration at CLTA and DNM2 . PCR was used to screen BSC - 1 and SK - MEL - 2 clones that were RFP - ( CLTA ) and / or GFP - ( DNM2 ) positive after FACS enrichment . For the initial pre - screening of clones , 2 μl of genomic DNA prepared using QuickExtract ( Epicentre Biotechnologies ) was ampli - fied in a 35 - cycle Accuprime Taq HiFi ( Invitrogen ) PCR with the TI primers listed in Supplementary Table S4 . An extension time of 10 min was used to minimize bias against the tagged allele ( s ) of the targeted gene . PCR products were analysed on 5 % criterion gels ( Bio - Rad ) that were run for 3 – 4 h at 150 V and visualized with ethidium bromide . Positive clones were then re - analysed independently using genomic DNA prepared with the Masterpure kit ( Epicentre Biotechnologies ) in 30 - cycle PCRs with 100 ng template DNA . The resulting amplicons were analysed as described above . Clones suitable for further analysis were identified by cloning the out - out PCR prod - ucts into pCR2 . 1 TOPO ( Invitrogen ) and conventional sequencing . Cell culture . SK - MEL - 2 cells and BSC - 1 cells were purchased from the ATCC . BSC - 1 GFP – LCa ( rCLTA X ) cells were provided by T . Kirchhausen ( Harvard Medical School , USA ) 12 . All cells were maintained under 5 % CO 2 at 37 °C in DMEM / F - 12 ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with 10 % FBS ( fetal bovine serum ; HyClone ) , except for BSC - 1 GFP – CLTA cells , for which the media was supple - mented with 0 . 5 mg ml – 1 G418 ( Invitrogen ) for selection . Plasmid construction . Human clathrin light chain A ( CLTA ) was amplified by PCR from a plasmid that was provided by L . Greene ( NIH , USA ) 36 . This CLTA sequence is identical to the CLTA expressed in SK - MEL - 2 cells . The African green monkey CLTA gene was amplified by reverse transcription PCR ( RT – PCR ) from poly - A mRNA of BSC - 1 cells and subcloned into a pEGFP - N1 vector ( Clontech ) in which GFP was replaced with TagRFP - T ( RFP ) 37 . TagRFP - T was a gift from R . Tsien ( UC , San Diego , USA ) . A GTSGGS linker was placed between CLTA and RFP . Dynamin - 2 ( DNM2 ) was amplified by RT – PCR from poly - A mRNA of SK - MEL - 2 cells and subcloned into a pEGFP - N1 vector with a GTSGGS linker between DNM2 and GFP . Donor Design . Approximately 1 . 5 kb of genomic DNA sequence surrounding the CLTA ( monkey or human for BSC - 1 or SK - MEL - 2 , respectively ) and DNM2 stop codons was amplified using the ‘HA’ primers listed in Supplementary Table S4 , and cloned into pCR8 - TOPO ( Invitrogen ) . Next , a unique KpnI site was intro - duced through Quikchange ( Agilent Technologies ) site - directed mutagenesis with the ‘QC’ primers . Finally , RFP or GFP was amplified using the ‘KpnI’ primers , which encode an amino - terminal GTSGGS linker , and cloned into the KpnI site of the CLTA or DNM2 homology arm constructs , respectively . Generation of stable overexpression cell lines . Human CLTA – RFP and DNM2 – GFP plasmids were transfected into SK - MEL - 2 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) according to manufacturer’s instructions . After 72 h , transfected SK - MEL - 2 cells were selected in DMEM / F - 12 containing 10 % FBS and 1 mg ml – 1 G - 418 . African green monkey CLTA – RFP plasmid was transfected into BSC - 1 cells using Fugene 6 ( Roche ) , following a standard protocol . After 72 h , transfected BSC - 1 cells were selected in DMEM / F - 12 containing 10 % FBS and 0 . 4 mg ml – 1 G418 ( Geneticin ) . Single - cell clones were selected and amplified by dilution clon - ing in 96 - well plates . Generation of genome - edited cell lines . ZFN and donor plasmids were trans - fected into cells using a single cuvette Amaxa Nucleofector device ( Lonza ) , according to manufacturer’s instructions . In brief , cells grown to ~ 80 % confluency were harvested by trypsinization , and 1 – 1 . 5 × 10 6 BSC - 1 or SK - MEL - 2 cells were resuspended in Nucleofector solution L or R and transfected using Nucleofector program A - 020 or T - 020 , respectively . After transfection , cells were subjected to cold - shock treatment 38 by incubation at 30 °C for 48 h before being transferred to 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 . Depending on the experiment , recovered cells were sorted for RFP - positive , GFP - positive or RFP - and GFP - positive signals using a DAKO - Cytomation MoFlo High Speed Sorter , either directly into 96 - well plates , or fol - lowed by growth for 1 week and cloning by limiting dilution . Western immunoblotting . For the preparation of lysates , cells were briefly washed in PBS , incubated with 0 . 5 mM EDTA for 5 min , and pelleted at 110 g for 2 min . The supernatant was subsequently removed , and hot 2 × protein sample buffer ( 125 mM Tris – HCl at pH 6 . 8 , 10 % glycerol , 10 % SDS , 130 mM dithiothreitol ; DTT , 0 . 05 % bromophenol blue and12 . 5 % β - mercaptoethanol ) was immediately added . After pellet resuspension by pipetting , samples were heated to 95 °C , for 3 min , separated by 8 % or 12 % SDS – PAGE , and transferred to Immobilon - FL PVDF transfer membrane ( IPFL - 00010 , Millipore ) or nitrocellulose membrane in transfer buffer ( 25 mM Trizma base , 200 mM glycine , 20 % methanol and 0 . 025 % SDS ) at 50 V and 4 °C , for 1 h . The membrane was subsequently rinsed in TBS ( Tris - buffered saline ) and incubated in Odyssey blocking buffer ( diluted 1 : 1 in PBS ) at room temperature for 1 h . Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated with the membrane at 4 °C overnight . The membrane was incubated in the following primary antibodies : anti - CLTA ( H - 55 ; 1 : 100 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , anti - DNM2 ( C - 18 ; 1 : 1000 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , anti - actin ( C4 ; 1 : 20 , 000 ; MP Biomedicals ) , anti - GFP ( B2 ; 1 : 2000 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) or anti - tRFP ( AB233 ; 1 : 500 ; Evrogen ) . Blots were subsequently incubated in the dark for 1 h at room temperature with secondary IRDye 680 or 800CW antibodies ( LI - COR Biosciences ) diluted to 1 : 5000 in Odyssey blocking buffer / PBS solution containing 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 . After washing with TBST ( Tris - Buffered Saline Tween - 20 ) , the membrane was incubated in TBS and scanned on an Odyssey infrared imager ( LI - COR Biosciences ) . Quantification of protein bands was performed using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System ( version 3 . 0 ) . Total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy and live - cell imag - ing . TIRF microscopy images were captured using Metamorph software on an Olympus IX - 81 microscope using a ×60 / NA 1 . 49 objective and an ORCA - R 2 cam - era ( Hamamatsu ) . The system was maintained at 37 °C using a WeatherStation chamber and temperature controller ( PrecisionControl ) . At 16 – 24 h before imaging , cells were seeded onto uncoated glass coverslips in growth medium . During imaging , cells were maintained in DMEM without phenol red that was supplemented with 5 % FBS and 10 mM HEPES . A 488 nm solid - state laser ( Melles Griot ) and a 561 nm diode - pumped solid - state laser ( Melles Griot ) were used to excite GFP and RFP fluorophores , respectively . For lifetime analysis , images were acquired every 2 s for 6 min , with an exposure time of 900 ms . Simultaneous two - colour TIRF images were obtained using a DV2 image splitter ( MAG Biosystems ) to separate GFP and RFP emission signals . Transferrin uptake assay . Cells were grown on glass coverslips in 6 - well plates overnight . The cells were serum - starved at 37 °C for 1 h in starving medium ( DMEM containing 20 mM HEPES at pH 7 . 4 and 5 mg ml – 1 BSA ; bovine serum albumin ) . They were then incubated in starving medium containing 25 mg ml – 1 Alexa Fluor 488 - or Texas Red - conjugated human transferrin ( Invitrogen ) at 37 °C for 0 – 45 min before fixation in 4 % paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min . After three washes with PBS , the coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent ( Invitrogen ) . The degree of trans - ferrin uptake was quantified using ImageJ software ( NIH , V1 . 44e ) . In brief , cell outlines were traced by using polygon or freehand selection tools , and the mean fluorescence intensity ( arbitrary units ) was measured for individual cells . Immunofluorescence staining . Cells were grown on glass coverslips in 6 - well plates overnight before fixation in 4 % paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min . After three washes with PBS , the coverslips were quenched with 1 mg ml – 1 NaBH 4 for 15 min twice , and the cells were permeabilized in 0 . 1 % saponin / PBS or 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 / PBS . After brief washing with PBS , the coverslips were incubated with anti - clathrin HC antibody ( MA1 - 065 , Thermo Scientific ) at 1 : 500 overnight at 4 °C . The coverslips were then washed with PBS for 15 min before incubation with anti - mouse secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 ( A21202 , Invitrogen ) or Alexa Fluor 568 ( A10037 , Invitrogen ) at 1 : 1000 dilution for 2 h at room tem - 8 nature cell biology advance online publication Doi : 10 . 1038 / ncb2175 Me t h oD S perature . After three washes with PBS , the coverslips were mounted on glass slides using ProLong Gold Antifade Reagent ( Invitrogen ) . Particle detection , tracking and image analysis . Particle detection and tracking were performed using Imaris 7 . 1 software ( Bitplane Scientific ) . Before particle detec - tion , images were first subjected to background subtraction . The Spots module of Imaris was then used to automatically detect point - like particles with an estimated spot diameter of 500 nm ( ~ 5 pixels ) . After automatic detection , detected spots were filtered based on satisfying minimum ‘intensity standard deviation’ and ‘quality’ control parameters . Only spots with values higher than the set threshold values were considered for analyses . Quality is defined as the intensity at the centre of the spot , Gaussian filtered by ¾ of the spot radius . Appropriate threshold values were con - firmed by visual inspection of correct particle detection . To trace objects through sequential frames of time data , a Brownian motion particle - tracking algorithm was applied . A maximum search distance of 350 nm was defined to disallow connections between a spot and a candidate match if the distance between the predicted future position of the spot and the candidate position exceeded the maximum distance . A gap - closing algorithm was also implemented to link track segment ends to track seg - ment starts to recover tracks that were interrupted by the temporary disappearance of particles . The maximum permissible gap length was set equal to 7 frames . Track outputs were then visually inspected and , as necessary , edited to correct for tracking errors . Only tracks that appeared and disappeared during the lifetime of the acquisi - tion ( that is , 181 frames , 6 min ) were subjected to lifetime analyses . Statistical analysis . One - way ANOVAs were used to assess the effect of genome editing on the mean lifetime of endocytic proteins at the plasma membrane . Significant results were followed by post - hoc Tukey – Kramer HSD ( honestly sig - nificant difference ) tests . All tests were performed using JMP 8 . 0 . 2 ( SAS Institute ) .

Top panel : The number of genotyped clones is given for each target in each cell type , along with the number ( percentage ) of correctly tagged clones having at least one ( but less than all ) allele tagged , or all alleles tagged . Clones that had smaller , larger , or unexpected combinations of out - out PCR products are classified as “Imprecise or Ambiguous” . Note that in all cases , cells were enriched by FACS for the cognate fluorescent marker prior to limiting dilution and genotyping . Lower panel : Summary of genotypes for genome - edited clones . Each clone was processed by out - out PCR ( as in Figs . 1b , 2a , 3b , and 4a ) , and the number of topo clones representing tagged or untagged alleles is given . The genotype of these alleles is shown in parenthesis . An asterisk ( * ) denotes alleles containing the indicated short insertion / deletion ( number in parentheses ) at the predicted cleavage site for DNM2 ZFN pair , which is located 43 bp downstream of the DNM2 stop codon in the 3’ UTR . Table S2 ZFN target sites and designed zinc finger helix sequences ( top panel ) . Bases in lower - case are skipped from a DNA recognition perspective by the zinc finger proteins ( ZFPs ) .
