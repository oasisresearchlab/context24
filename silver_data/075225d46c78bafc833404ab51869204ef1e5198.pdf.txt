We are studying intercompartmental protein transport to the yeast lysosome - like vacuole with a reconstitution assay using permeabilized spheroplasts that measures , in an ATP and cytosol dependent reac - tion , vacuolar delivery and proteolytic maturation of the Golgi - modified precursor forms of vacuolar hydro - lases like carboxypeptidase Y ( CPY ) . To identify the potential donor compartment in this assay , we used subcellular fractionation procedures that have uncov - ered a novel membrane - enclosed prevacuolar transport intermediate . Differential centrifugation was used to separate permeabilized spheroplasts into 15K and 150K g membrane pellets . Centrifugation of these pellets to equilibrium on sucrose density gradients separated vacuolar and Golgi complex marker en - zymes into light and dense fractions , respectively . When the Golgi - modified precursor form of CPY ( p2CPY ) was examined ( after a 5 - min pulse , 30 - s chase ) , as much as 30 - 40 % fractionated with an inter - mediate density between both the vacuole and the Golgi complex . Pulse - chase labeling and fractionation of membranes indicated that p2CPY in this gradient region had already passed through the Golgi complex , which kinetically ordered it between the Golgi and the vacuole . A mutant CPY protein that lacks a functional vacuolar sorting signal was detected in Golgi fractions but not in the intermediate compartment indicating that this corresponds to a post - sorting compartment . Based on the low transport efficiency of the mutant CPY protein in vitro ( decreased by sevenfold ) , this in - termediate organelle most likely represents the donor compartment in our reconstitution assay . This or - ganelle is not likely to be a transport vesicle inter - mediate because EM analysis indicates enrichment of 250 - 400 nm compartments and internalization of surface - bound 35S - or - factor at 15°C resulted in its ap - parent cofractionation with wild - type p2CPY , indicat - ing an endosome - like compartment ( Singer , B . , and H . Reizman . 1990 . J . Cell Biol . 110 : 1911 - 1922 ) . Frac - tionation of p2CPY accumulated in the temperature sensitive vpsl5 mutant revealed that the vpsl5 trans - port block did not occur in the endosome - like com - partment but rather in the late Golgi complex , pre - sumably the site of CPY sorting . Therefore , as seen in mammalian cells , yeast CPY is sorted away from secretory proteins in the late Golgi and transits to the vacuole via a distinct endosome - like intermediate . p ROTEIN transport within the eukaryotic secretory path - way involves the intercompartmental delivery of pro - teins from the ER to the cell surface via the Golgi complex ( Palade , 1975 ) . The compartmental framework of the Golgi complex includes the cis Golgi network , medial Golgi cisternae , and the TGN , which are topologically and functionally distinct ( Mellman and Simons , 1992 ) . Carrier vesicles facilitate transport from the ER , to and through the Golgi compartments , to the TGN , where selection and sort - ing occurs for intracellular and extracellular destinations ( Griffiths and Simons , 1986 ) .

Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants and biochemical re - constitution assays in mammalian systems have greatly en - hanced our understanding of the discrete vesicle - mediated steps between various secretory pathway organelles ( for re - views see Rothman and Orci , 1992 ; and Pryer et al . , 1992 ) . The temperature - sensitive sec mutants not only identified a variety of gene products required for movement of secretory proteins to the cell surface ( Novick et al . , 1980 ) , but also determined their epistatic relationships , which confirmed the order of events within the eukaryotic secretory pathway ( Novick et al . , 1981 ; Kaiser and Schekman , 1990 ) . Cell - free biochemical assays , measuring transfer between membrane - enclosed donor and acceptor compartments , have also played a role in elucidating details of vesicle - mediated trans - © The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 93 / 06 / 1245 / 12 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 121 , Number 6 , June 1993 1245 - 1256 1245 port ( Balch , 1989 ) . This approach has identified several pro - teins acting as transport factors such as the N - ethylmale - imide sensitive fusion factor , NSE ( Block et al . , 1988 ) , numerous small molecular weight G proteins ( Balch , 1990 ; Pfeffer , 1992 ) , several soluble NSF attachment proteins , SNAPs , ( Clary et al . , 1990 ; Clary and Rothman , 1990 ) , ETF1 , a protein involved in recycling from late endosomes to the TGN ( Goda and Pfeffer , 1991 ) , and a 145 - kD protein that acts during Ca2 + - regulated secretion in neuroendocrine cells ( Walent et al . , 1992 ) . The genetic and biochemical ap - proaches studying protein transport within the early secre - tory pathway have been highly complementary as several SEC gene products are homologous to mammalian proteins identified with cell - free assays . Genetics and biochemistry are also being combined to dis - sect a branch point in the yeast secretory pathway , sorting and transport to the lysosome - like vacuole . The vacuole pro - tein sorting defective mutants , vps , fall into over 40 com - plementation groups whose principle phenotype is the secre - tion of vacuolar precursor proteins ( Bankaitis et al . , 1986 ; Rothman and Stevens , 1986 ; Robinson et al . , 1988 ; Rothman et al . , 1989 ) . Specific modifications , which mark transit through secretory organelles , occurs for most precur - sor forms of vacuolar proteins like carboxypeptidase Y ( CPY ) . ~ The 67 kD plCPY precursor has four N - linked core oligosaccharides and resides in the ER and early Golgi complex ( Stevens et al . , 1982 ; Franzusoff and Schekman , 1989 ) . The 69 - kD p2CPY precursor contains additional mannose residues , predominately cd , 3 - 1inked , and resides in later compartments of the Golgi complex ( Franzusoff and Schekman , 1989 ; Graham and Emr , 1991 ) . Upon arrival in the vacuole , the 90 aa propeptide on p2CPY is proteolyti - cally removed , Which gives rise to the 61 - kD mature form ofCPY ( mCPY ; Stevens et al . , 1982 ) . All of the vps mutants secrete the Golgi - modified p2CPY precursor to the cell sur - face . A biochemical assay that faithfully reconstitutes inter - compartmental transport and proteolytic maturation of CPY has recently been developed ( Vida et al . , 1990 ) . In addition to being ATP and cytosol dependent , the in vitro assay shows VPS gene product - dependence and specificity for p2CPY . The specificity for p2CPY indicates that the assay shows preference for a specific donor compartment , which could be the Golgi complex . The basic compartmental transport path - way for CPY ( ER - - " Golgi - * vacuole ) ( Stevens et al . , 1982 ) is now more completely understood with recent evidence demonstrating the existence of yeast Golgi subcompartments ( Cunningham and Wickner , 1989 ; Franzusoff and Schek - man , 1989 ; Bowser and Novick , 1991 ; Graham and Emr , 1991 ) . Indeed , p2CPY travels through the Kex2p - containing late Golgi compartment , which is the presumptive site for sorting vacuolar proteins away from secreted proteins ( Gra - ham and Emr , 1991 ) . However , even with this more highly refined view , little is known about the steps between the late Golgi and the vacuole . We have characterized the pathway between the late Golgi and the vacuole using subcellular fractionation techniques . The results demonstrate that a novel prevacuolar compart - ment exists between the late Golgi and the vacuole . This 1 .

The prevacuolar , endosomal compartment appears to act as the donor organelle during in vitro reconstitution of intercompartmental transport to the vacuole . Additionally , vacuolar proteins are not sorted in this compartment but rather must be sorted to this compartment before they reach the vacuole . Overall , the data suggest that yeast vacuolar protein traffic is remarkably similar to mammalian lyso - somal protein traffic : each appears to require transit through an endosomal intermediate compartment . Materials and Methods Strains and Plasmids The wild - type parental strain for these studies was SEY6210 MATo ~ ; ura3 - 52 ; his3 - A200 ; trpl - A901 ; 1eu2 - 3 , 112 ; lys2 - 801 ; suc2 - A9 ; GAL . SEY6210 was transformed with lineafized pJL1 , which generated TVY6 containing a complete replacement of the PRC1 gene with the HIS3 gene ( Aprcl : : HIS3 ) . TVY6 was separately transformed with the centromeric vector pSEYC58 containing the EcoR1 to EcoR1 fragment of the PRC1 gene , and with pLV41 ( Vails et al . , 198 % 1990 ) , which replaces glutamine 24 with lysine . TVY6 containing these two plasmids was used for all experiments with the missorting CPY mutant . Tom Stevens ( University of Oregon , Eu - gene , OR ) kindly provided both pLV41 and piLl .

Binding and internalization of 35S - t ~ - factor were performed with spheroplasts using previously published methods ( Singer and Riezman , 1990 ) . Growth and Radiolabeling of Yeast Strains Yeast strains were grown and converted to spheroplasts as described previ - ously ( Vida et al . , 1990 ) except 0 . 2 - 0 . 5 % glusulase ( Dupont / New England Nuclear , Boston , MA ) was included with lyticase during the first 15 min of digestion followed by a 10 - min digestion with Novozyme ( NOVO - Nor - disk , Copenhagen , Denmark ; used at 10 / zg / OD600 U ) . Spheroplasts were pulsed with Tran35S - label ( ICN , Irvine , CA ) for 2 , 5 , or 15 rain and chased for varying times with 5 mM Met , 1 mM Cys , and 0 . 5 % yeast extract de - pending on experimental needs . Spheroplasts were mock labeled under identical conditions for marker protein analysis . Fractionation of Yeast Spheroplasts Differential Extraction and Centrifugation . All spheroplast preparations were frozen over liquid nitrogen vapors as previously described ( Vida et al . , 1990 ) , containing 25 - 30 OD ~ 00 U / tube . After thawing , spheroplasts were washed on ice in the following scheme : 3 - 5 min with 250 mM sorbitol in 20 mM Hepes - KOH pH 6 . 8 , 150 mM potassium acetate , and 5 mM mag - nesium acetate ( transport buffer salts ) ; 3 min with 50 mM sorbitol in trans - port buffer salts ; 5 min with 2 . 0 M potassium acetate , 250 mM sorbitol , in transport buffer salts ; and 5 rain with 250 mM sorbitol in transport buffer salts . After each resuspension / incubation , the cells were harvested in a microfuge ( model 235B , Fisher Scientific Co . , Pittsburgh , PA ) for 30 - 45 s at full speed ( , o13 , 000 g ) . The combined supernatants from the four washes were designated the $ 1 supernatant ( cytosol ) and resulting pellet designated the P1 ( permeabilized cells ) . A small portion of the P1 pellet ( usually 5 - 10 % of the total ) was used for in vitro assays reconstituting intercompartmental transport to the vacuole using 1 mg / ml exogenous cytosol as previously de - scribed ( Vida et al . , 1990 ) . The remaining 90 - 95 % of the P1 pellet was ex - tracted three times with 1 ml of 0 . 8 M sorbitol , 10 mM triethanolamine - acetic acid , 1 mM EDTA , pH 7 . 6 ( TEA buffer ) by resuspension through a 26 gauge syringe needle ( up and down 3 - 5 times ) . Every extraction was in - cubated on ice for 5 min and then the pellet was harvested in a microfuge for 5 rain at 13 , 000 g . The combined supernatants from TEA buffer extrac - tion were subjected to centrifugation in an SS - 34 Sorvall rotor at 15 , 000 g The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 121 , 1993 1246 Figure 1 . CPY with a mutant sorting signal is inefficiently trans - ported in vitro . ( A ) In vivo . Spheroplasts from TVY6 , containing plasmids encoding either the wild - type PRCI gene ( WT CPY ) or with glutamine 24 changed to lysine ( Q24K CPY ) , were pulsed with Tran3 ~ S - label for 5 min and then chased for the indicated times . At each chase point , the cells were diluted into ice - cold iso - tonic buffer containing 10 mM NaN3 and NaF and separated into an extracellular media ( E ) and intracellular cell pellet ( / ) fractions by centrifugation . Both fractions were then immunoprecipitated for CPY . ( B ) In vitro . Permeabilized ceils were made from the 30 s ( WT ) and 6 min ( Q ~ d ~ ) chase points and incubated with buffer alone , ATP , an ATP regeneration system , and cytosolic protein ex - tracts as indicated . CPY was immunoprecipitated first ( upper ) and then PrA was immunoprecipitated from the same samples ( lower ) . Quantitation of efficiency is the quotient of the amount of mature protein and of Golgi - modified precursor plus mature expressed as a percent . for 15 min . The resulting supernatant was designated the $ 2 and the small pellet was combined with large pellet in the microfuge tube and designated the pellet . The $ 2 supernatant was then subjected to centrifugation in a Beckman TLA100 . 1 rotor at 150 , 000 g ( average ) for 30 rain and the result - ing supernatant and pellet were designated the $ 3 and P3 , respectively . Equilibrium Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation . All sucrose so - lutions were made wt / wt , % with ultra - pure sucrose ( J . T . Baker ) from a 66 % stock solution and contained 10 mM Hepes - KOH pH 7 . 6 . The gradient consisted of 0 . 5 m161 % , 1 . 0 m142 % , 1 . 0 m137 % , 1 . 5 m134 % , 2 . 0 m132 % , 2 . 0 ml 29 % , 1 . 0 ml 27 % , and 1 . 5 rnl 22 % . The P3 or P2 pellets were separately resuspended ( or combined ) in 1 ml TEA buffer with 0 . 8 M sor - bitol and loaded on top of the gradient . The gradient was subjected to cen - trifugation in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 170 , 000 g for 16 - 20 h at 4°C . 16 0 . 72 ml fractions were collected from the top and any pellet resuspended in the last fraction . For radiolabeled samples , 300 t ~ g of carrier BSA was added to each fraction and precipitated with TCA ( 10 % final ) for at least 30 rain on ice . The TCA pellets were then processed and immunoprecipi - tared as described previously ( Vida et al . , 1990 ) . All quantitation of gels was done with either a Molecular Dynamics Phosphorimager ( Sunnyvale , CA ) or a LKB densitometer ( ULTRASCAN XL ) . Enzyme Assays All enzymes were measured using standard conditions as reported for NADPH cytochrome c reductase ( Kubota et al . , 1977 ) , guanosine diphos - phatase ( Abeijon et al . , 1989 ) , Kex2p ( Fuller et al . , 1989 ) . Total protein was measured with the BioRad Laboratories ( Richmond , CA ) protein dye binding assay according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . Electron Microscopy Approximately 250 ODt00 U of SEY6210 spheroplasts were subjected to differential extraction and centrifugation as described above . The 1 > 2 and P3 pellets were then separately applied to sucrose gradients and subjected to centrifugation for 18 - 20 h at 170 , 000 g . After taking 16 fractions from the top , fractions 1 and 2 ( from the gradient of the P2 pellet ) and fractions 5 and 6 , and 12 and 13 ( from the gradient of the P3 pellet ) were pooled separately and 1 ml was immediately fixed with 1 ml of 3 . 0 % glutaralde - hyde , 1 . 6 M sorbitol , 10 mM Hepes - KOH , 2 mM EDTA , and 100 mM caco - dylate buffer pH 7 . 5 for 1 h on ice . One ml of 0 . 1 M cacodylate pH 7 . 6 was then added and the fixed membranes were sedimented at 150 , 000 g ( aver - age ) for 2 h at 4°C in a Beckman TLA100 . 1 rotor . The three pellets were then processed for electron microscopy as described ( Hobman et al . , 1992 ) . Results CPY with a Mutant Sorting Signal Is Ine ~ iciently Transported In Vitro The reconstitution assay , measuring intercompartmental protein transport to the yeast vacuole , relies on radiolabeling spheroplasts to generate CPY precursors in vivo . The spec - ificity of the assay for the Golgi - modified CPY precursor ( p2 ) suggested that it reconstituted a single step in the vacu - ole delivery pathway ( Vida et al . , 1990 ) . To investigate this specificity in more detail , a mutant form of CPY was used as a substrate for the in vitro assay . The 90 amino acid NH2 - terminal propeptide in CPY contains information that is both necessary and sufficient for directing this protein to the vacuole ( Johnson et al . , 1987 ; Vails et al . , 1987 ) . Indeed , a minimal sorting signal has been mapped to amino acids 24 - 27 , QRPL . Normally , > 95 % of wild - type CPY is sorted to the vacuole . However , when glutamine 24 is replaced with lysine ( Q24K ) , 80 - 90 % of newly synthesized CPY is not sorted to the vacuole but instead is secreted to the cell sur - face ( Vails et al . , 1990 ) . After a 5 - min pulse and 60 - min chase , , , o85 % of the p2 precursor form of this mutant CPY was secreted from spheroplasts ( Fig . 1 , A ) . Importantly , the glutamine to lysine change in the propeptide does not affect proteolytic processing of the small amount of CPY that is de - livered to the vacuole ( Vails et al . , 1990 ; and Fig . 1 A ) . The transport properties of Q ~ K CPY made it an excel - lent candidate for testing the specificity of the intercompart - mental reconstitution assay . Using permeabilized sphero - Vida et al .

The S1 supernatant and P1 pellet were coimmunoprecipitated for the cytosolic enzyme glucose - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GtPDH ) . plasts , nearly 60 % of wild - type p2CPY is converted to mCPY after incubation with ATP and cytosol ( Fig . 1 B ) . In contrast , only about 9 % of Q24K p2CPY was converted to mature CPY after a comparable incubation ( Fig . 1 B ) . As an internal control , the in vitro transport characteristics of proteinase A ( PrA ) were examined with the same permeabi - lized cells . The transport efficiency for PrA was essentially the same using permeabilized spheroplasts from wild - type cells or cells expressing Q2 , K CPY ( Fig . 1 B ) . This dem - onstrated that both permeabilized cell samples were equally competent for re , constitution of intercompartmental protein transport to the vacuole and the low efficiency seen with the Q24K mutant reflected its inability to be sorted to the vacu - ole . The nearly sevenfold reduction in vacuolar transport efficiency of the mutant p2CPY relative to wild - type CPY suggested that sorting information in the CPY propeptide was required for efficient reconstitution ofintercompartmen - tal transport to the yeast vacuole . One explanation consistent with this result is that the intracellular sorting apparatus does not efficiently recognize Q24K CPY and subsequent deliv - ery to the vacuole or perhaps to another organeUe that func - tions as the donor compartment is perturbed . To address this , subcellular fractionation techniques were used to iden - tify organelles that contain the p2CPY precursor . Fractionation of CPY Precursors by Differential Extraction and Centrifugation Subcellular fractionation requires specific strategies to gen - erate organelles for separation on the basis of their inherent characteristics , which can be followed by marker protein analysis . The radiolabeled precursors of CPY , particularly the Golgi - modified p2 precursor , were initially used as marker proteins to develop conditions for their separation . We chose to use permeabilized cells ( rather than completely lysed cells ) as the starting point in our fractionation studies for two reasons : ( a ) quantitative removal of cytosolic protein af - forded a quick purification step and ( b ) with a functional as - The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 121 , 1993 1248 1 ~ o - A 1 . 2 . 5 . 1 . 20 - " 1 . 15 - " 1 . 10 • l . f ~ . 1 . 00 • ' , o , • , • , , • , • , • • • 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 , , B 20 - 4 - - o - GDPase lO 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 c 30 25 20 15 1o $ o 2 , ~ 6 s ~ o ~ z ~ 4 ~ 6 Fraction No .

We included a 2 . 0 M potassium acetate step during the washing protocol for permeabilized cell preparation ( Fig . 2 A ) . This routinely ensured quantita - tive removal of cytosolic protein ( S1 supernatant in Fig . 2 B and Table I ) . Organdies of the early secretory pathway ( ER and Golgi complex ) remained intact after these washes as measured by their ability to retain pl and p2CPY ( P1 pellet in Fig . 2 B and Table I ) . They also remained functional for the intercompartmental in vitro protein transport assay ( Fig . 1B ) . The buffers used to remove cytosol contain physiological levels of magnesium and potassium ions , which are required to maintain organelle associations with the permeabilized cells ( Vida et al . , 1990 ) . Subsequent differential extraction with an isotonic , low ionic strength buffer ( 0 . 8 M sorbitol , 10 mM triethanolamine - EDTA ) resulted in disassociation of permeabilized cells into dispersed organelles . After three such extractions , low speed centrifugation ( 15 , 000 g ) sepa - rated precursor and mature forms of CPY ( 10 ' pulse , 5 ' chase ) into the resulting supernatant ( $ 2 ) and pellet ( P2 ) , respectively ( Fig . 2 B and Table I ) . The amount of p2CPY that remained in the $ 2 supernatant fraction was variable de - pending on the precise pulse / chase conditions but was rou - tinely at least 40 - 50 % of the total ( Table I ) . The p2CPY that did not sediment after repeated centrifugation at 15 , 000 g was not merely a result of lysed compartment ( s ) , because it did sediment to the P3 pellet fraction after centrifugation at 150 , 000 g ( Fig . 2 B and Table I ) . In contrast , > 75 % of the plCPY precursor reproducibly sedimented in the P2 pellet fraction regardless of the pulse / chase conditions . Likewise , nearly 80 % of the vacuolar marker protein alkaline phospha - tase ( ALP ) sedimented to the P2 pellet fraction after cen - trifugation at 15 , 000 g . The sedimentation characteristics of resident organellar marker proteins were compared with ra - diolabeled CPY during differential extraction ( Table I ) . As expected , plCPY behaved like the ER marker NADPH cytochrome c reductase . In contrast , almost 50 % of two Golgi marker proteins , Kex2p and GDPase , were in the S1 supernatant fraction whereas Golgi - modified p2CPY was re - covered almost quantitatively in the P1 permeabilized cell pellet . Nearly half of the Kex2p activity in the S1 could be sedimented at 150 , 000 g , suggesting that a portion of this late Golgi complex marker was not solubilized during cell per - meabilization ( data not shown ) . Finally , when examined un - der the light microscope , the P2 and P3 pellets did not con - tain significant amounts of unbroken or permeabilized cells ( data not shown ) . A Large Portion ofGolgi - Modified p2CPY Fractionates with a Novel Prevacuolar Compartment The conditions for dissociating organelles from permeabi - lized cells led to the enrichment of certain organelles after differential centrifugation , which were further fractionated on sucrose density gradients . Under isopycnic conditions , this technique separates organelles on the basis of inherent buoyant density differences and when applied to yeast or - ganelles , resolves the ER , mitochondria , plasma membrane , vacuole , and the Golgi complex ( Walworth et al . , 1989 ) . We established conditions to optimize separation of the vacuole and the Golgi complex , such that their marker proteins banded near the top and the bottom of a sucrose density gra - dient , respectively . Essentially , this involved constructing a shallow density gradient of sucrose ( Fig . 3 A ) . Two different vacuolar marker proteins , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) and mCPY , were recovered at the top of such a sucrose gradient ( Fig . 3 C ) . Because ALP is an integral membrane protein and mCPY is a soluble lumenal marker , the cofractionation of these two enzymes suggests that the vacuole remained in - tact during the different fractionation procedures . Although Vida et al . Prevacuolar Compartment in Yeast 1249 Figure 4 . Equilibrium sucrose gradient fractionation of Golgi - modified vacuolar precursor proteins . The same TVY6 sphero - plasts from Fig . 1 were extracted and subjected to differential cen - trifugation as described in Materials and Methods . The 150 , 000 g P3 pellet was subjected to equilibrium sucrose gradient centrifuga - tion and immunoprecipitated for CPY and PrA . ( A ) Wild - type CPY ( 39 , 686 , 850 cpm loaded ) . ( B ) Q24K CPY , and ( C ) Wild - type PrA from the same gradient as Q24K CPY ( 33 , 903 , 350 cpm loaded ) . the mCPY may have been released from ruptured vacuoles , this lumenal marker also migrated to the top of the gradient after loading a resuspended membrane pellet at the bottom ( data not shown ) . Under these conditions , both enzymes were recovered in a single peak at fraction 1 of the gradient , indicating that the vacuole had a low density of x < 1 . 059 g / ml ( 15 % , wt / wt sucrose ) . In contrast to these vacuolar en - zymes , two Golgi complex enzymes , GDPase and Kex2p , banded at higher density in the sucrose gradient at fractions 8 - 10 ( 1 . 133 - 1 . 140 g / ml ) and fraction 13 ( 1 . 163 g / ml ) , respec - tively ( Fig . 3 B ) . The fractionation characteristics of Golgi - modified forms of CPY also were examined in this type of sucrose gradient . To enhance detection of these transient precursors , sphero - plasts were radiolabeled using a 5 - rain pulse and a 30 s chase . The spheroplasts were subjected to differential extrac - tion and centrifugation to generate a 150 , 000 g P3 pellet , which was further fractionated on the sucrose gradient . Im - munoprecipitating each fraction with CPY antiserum showed that p2CPY migrated through the gradient with peak frac - tions at 6 , 8 , and 10 ( Fig . 4 A ) . The p2CPY with peak frac - tions at 8 and 10 overlapped well with the Golgi complex markers , GDPase and Kex2p ( Fig . 3 B ) . In contrast , the p2CPY at fraction 6 , representing 35 - 40 % of the total , was not coincident with the fractionation behavior of Golgi or vacuolar marker proteins ( Fig . 3 , B and C ) . This p2CPY at fraction 6 ( Fig . 4 A ) was less dense ( 1 . 119 g / ml ) than GDPase at fraction 8 ( Fig . 3 B ) and was very well separated from the late Golgi - containing Kex2p at fraction 13 ( Fig . 3 B ) . Be - cause CPY is known to transit through this late Golgi sub - compartment ( Graham and Emr , 1991 ) , the low density peak of p2CPY was localized in a compartment distal or proximal to the Kex2p - containing late Golgi . To determine if a kinetic relationship existed between the high and low density p2CPY - containing fractions , mem - branes from different times of chase were fractionated to dis - tinguish which represented early and late compartments . Af - ter a 2 - min pulse , cells were chased for 1 and 20 min to stop p2CPY at potentially different points in the secretory path - way . These time points were chosen because p2CPY repre - sented 15 - 20 % of the total radiolabeled CPY . At 1 min of chase , the majority of CPY was still present as the pl precur - sor whereas at 20 min of chase the majority of CPY had been converted to the mature vacuolar form ( data not shown ) . When membranes from these time points were fractionated on sucrose gradients , the amount of p2CPY that was recov - ered in fractions 3 - 7 increased over threefold after 20 rain of chase , whereas recovery in fractions 9 - 13 decreased over threefold ( Fig . 5 ) . This demonstrated that early p2CPY moved from a compartment ( s ) with relatively high density , like the Golgi complex , to a compartment ( s ) with lower den - sity , unlike both the late Golgi and the vacuole . The Qz , K Mutant Form of CPY Does Not Fractionate with the Low Density Prevacuolar Compartment The fractionation profile of p2CPY on sucrose gradients sug - gested that its route to the vacuole involved transit through a low density compartment distal to the Kex2p - containlng late Golgi compartment . The Kex2p - containing compart - ment appears to be the site where protein sorting occurs as it is the last compartment where vacuolar and secreted pro - teins are present together ( Graham and Emr , 1991 ) .

Golgi - modified CPY moves from dense to light compart - ments during pulse / chase analysis . Spheroplasts from SEY6210 were pulse labeled for 2 min and chased for 1 and 20 min at 30°C ( as indicated ) . The cells were extracted and subjected to differential centrifugation as described in Materials and Methods . The 15 , 000 g 132 and 150 , 000 g P3 pellets were combined , subjected to equilib - rium sucrose gradient centrifugation , and immunoprecipitated for CPY . if the Q ~ , K mutant form of CPY transits through the low density compartment on its way to the cell surface , the mis - sorting mutant was fractionated on sucrose gradients using 150 , 000 g P3 pellets from the same cells shown in Fig . 1 . Very little of Q2 ~ K p2CPY was found in the gradient at Figure 6 . Equilibrium sucrose gradient fractionation of Golgi - modified CPY from a temperature sensitive vps15 mutant blocked at the nonpermissive temperature . Spheroplasts from PHY112 har - boring pPHY192 were shifted to 38°C for 2 rain . The ceils were then pulse labeled for 5 min and chased for 30 rain . After the chase , the cells were extracted and subjected to differential centrifugation as described in Materials and Methods . The 15 , 000 g P2 and 150 , 000 g P3 membrane pellets were combined , subjected to equi - librium sucrose gradient centrifugation , and immunoprecipitated for CPY . fraction 6 while the majority was found in fractions 12 - 14 ( Fig . 4 B ) . This resulted in " o30 - fold more QE4K p2CPY in the denser region of the gradient compared to wild - type CPY ( Fig . 4 A ) . In addition , fractions 12 - 14 also contained the late Golgi marker , Kex2p ( Fig . 3 B ) . The Golgi - modified PrA precursor had a distinctly different fractionation pattern than Q ~ K p2CPY within the same gradient . It behaved very similar to wild - type CPY ( Fig . 4 C ) . From this analy - sis , a strong correlation existed between the fractionation of p2CPY or p2PrA in a compartment ( s ) of low density ( Fig . 4 ) and the sorting capabilities of these precursors . Further - more , this correlation extended to their efficiency for inter - compartmental transport in vitro ( Fig . 1 B ) , suggesting that this low density compartment acted as a donor compartment . A vps15 Temperature Sensitive Mutant Blocks Transport of Vacuolar Proenzymes in the Late Golgi Complex In the previous experiments with wild - type cells , different times of chase were used to enrich for intermediate forms of vacuolar proteins in different organelles throughout the secretory pathway . Alternatively , temperature sensitive mu - tants can be used to block protein transport at distinct steps that lead to specific organelles quantitatively accumulating normally transient precursor proteins . Temperature - condi - tional vpsl5 mutants that contain COOH - terminal trunca - tions impose a reversible block in the vacuolar protein deliv - ery pathway ( Herman et al . , 1991 ) . Immediately upon shift to the nonpermissive temperature , these temperature sensi - tive mutants accumulate Golgi - modified p2CPY . To deter - mine where in the pathway this block occurs , a temperature sensitive vpsl5 mutant strain was shifted to the nonpermis - sive temperature ( 38°C ) for 2 rain , pulse labeled for 5 min , and chased for 30 rain . Under these conditions , ~ 85 % of the newly synthesized p2CPY accumulated intracellularly . Af - ter differential extraction and centrifugation , ~ 85 % of the blocked p2CPY sedimented in the 15 , 000 g P2 pellet ( data not shown ) . When the P2 and P3 pellets were combined and analyzed on a sucrose gradient , , ~ 60 % of the p2CPY was found in fractions 12 - 14 ( Fig . 6 ) . A smaller amount of p2CPY was observed at fractions 2 - 3 ( Fig . 6 ) . Unlike the p2CPY in fractions 12 - 14 , the p2CPY in fractions 2 - 3 could not be sedimented at 100 , 000 g indicating that this CPY was released during centrifugation by lysis of the compartment . The 38°C labeling conditions used to impose the vpsl5 block did not change the fractionation profile of Kex2p ( data not shown ) . Thus , the peak of p2CPY at fraction 13 was identi - cal to the fractionation pattern of Kex2p ( Fig . 3 B ) , suggest - ing the transport block occurs in a late Golgi compartment . Endocytosed s - Factor Cofractionates with the Low Density Prevacuolar Compartment The organelle ( s ) in the low density region of the sucrose gra - dients ( fractions 3 - 7 ) that contained substantial amounts of Golgi - modified vacuolar precursors did not cofractionate with known yeast marker proteins . Therefore , these fractions may have represented a unique compartment in the yeast cell , which could be a transport vesicle intermediate be - tween the late Golgi and the vacuole . However , the density of this compartment was very similar , if not identical , to the density of the endosomal compartment in which internalized Vida et ill .

Equilibrium sucrose gradient fractionation of 35S - c ~ - factor internalized at 15°C . ( A ) Approximately 375 , 000 cpm of 35S - or - factor were incubated with spheroplasts from GPY385 for 60 min at 0°C . The cells were briefly washed , and incubated at 15°C for 25 rain in the presence or absence of NaN3 and NaF as indicated . After internalization , the cells were extracted and sub - jected to differential centrifugation as described in Materials and Methods . The 150 , 000 g P3 pellet was subjected to equilibrium su - crose gradient centrifugation and the amount of radioactivity in each fraction was determined with a scintillation counter . The start - ing 35S - or - factor was judged to be > 98 % pure when analyzed with both SDS - PAGE and TLC . ( B ) Spheroplasts from GPY74 - 15C were pulse labeled at 30°C for 5 rain and chased for 1 min . The cells were washed briefly , then incubated at 0°C for 60 min , and at 15°C for 25 min . After this incubation scheme , the radiolabeled CPY comprised ' °20 % plCPY , 65 % p2CPY , and 15 % mCPY . The cells were extracted and subjected to differential centrifugation as de - scribed in Materials and Methods . The 150 , 000 g P3 membrane pellet was subjected to equilibrium sucrose gradient centrifugation and each fraction was immunoprecipitated for CPY . u - factor has been detected during endocytosis and transport to the vacuole ( Singer and Riezman , 1990 ) . To examine this apparent similarity , ~ factor was fraction - ated under the above conditions after receptor - mediated internalization . Spheroplasts were incubated with 35S - u - fac - tor at 0°C for 60 min , resulting in 50 - 60 % of the ligand bound to the cell surface . Internalization was performed at 15°C to slow membrane transport , which allows the inter - nalized ligand to localize between the vacuole and the plasma membrane ( Singer and Riezman , 1990 ) . A parallel incuba - tion was performed in the presence of energy poisons ( NAN3 and NaF ) , which blocks imternalization and traps the ligand at the plasma membrane . During differential cen - trifugation , nearly 80 % of the ligand remained associated with the P1 permeabilized cell pellet ( Table I ) . After cen - trifugation to equilibrium on sucrose gradients , 35S - u - factor exhibited an energy dependent difference in its banding profile . Under conditions that block internalization ( NAN3 and NaF ) , a sharp peak of 35S - u - factor at fraction 14 was recovered in the dense region of the gradient ( Fig . 7 A ) , con - sistent with the density of the plasma membrane ( Singer and Riezman , 1990 ) . In the absence of energy poisons , the amount of radiolabeled u - factor at fraction 14 dropped , , ~ threefold and resulted in a lower density peak between fractions 4 - 6 with a broad shoulder between fractions 7 - 10 ( Fig . 7 A ) . When p2CPY was examined under these condi - tions , namely incubation of cells at 150C , it cofractionated with the low density peak of internalized 35S - u - factor be - tween fractions 4 - 6 ( Fig . 7 B ) , which suggested this com - partment was endosome - like rather than a transport vesicle intermediate . Morphology and Polypeptide Composition of Membrane Pellets Enriched for the Golgi Complex , the Prevacuolar Compartment , and the Vacuole Various sucrose density gradient fractions were examined by electron microscopy to determine their morphological char - acteristics . Three pairs of fractions from two sucrose gra - dients were pooled , fixed , and sedimented to obtain three membrane pellets : fractions 1 and 2 from a gradient loaded with a 15 , 000 g P2 pellet ; and fractions 5 and 6 , and 12 and 13 from a gradient loaded with a 150 , 000 g P3 pellet . The general appearance of all these pellets consisted of mem - brane - enclosed compartments of varying size ( Fig . 8 ) . The Golgi complex pellet ( fractions 12 and 13 from P3 ) consisted of relatively small 150 - 250 nm vesicles that contained numerous electron - dense 300 - 1 , 000 nm long tubule cister - nae ( Fig . 8 , A and D ) . This structure is reminiscent of both mammalian ( Mellman and Simons , 1992 ) and yeast Golgi ( Preuss et al . , 1992 ) . The vacuole - enriched pellet ( fractions 1 and 2 from P2 ) contained large 750 - 1 , 250 nm membrane - bounded organelles , some of which contained multiple smaller 50 - 200 nm vesicles within them ( Fig . 8 , C and F ) . The endosomal - enriched pellet ( fractions 5 and 6 from P3 ) was devoid of Golgi - like tubule cisternae and contained mem - brane - enclosed compartments of 250 - - 400 nm in diameter ( Fig . 8 , B and E ) . Thus , the morphology of the endosome - enriched membrane fraction was distinct from both the vacu - ole and the Golgi complex , suggesting that it may have con - sisted of a unique membrane - enclosed compartment ( s ) . The protein composition of these membrane pellets was Figure 8 . Morphology of membranes enriched for the vacuole , Golgi complex , and the prevacuolar , endosomal compartment .

Approximately 2 . 5 x 109 cells from SEY6210 were con - verted to spheroplasts and subjected to differential extraction and centrifugation as described in Materials and Methods . The P2 and P3 pellets were then subjected to centrifugation on sucrose gra - dients .

The total protein content ( 73 and that which was soluble ( S ) or sedimentable ( P ) in sodium carbonate were analyzed from each fraction on a 12 % SDS polyacrylamide gel . 5 # g of protein were loaded in each lane and visualized with a silver stain . Molecular weights are given in kilodaltons . compared using one - dimensional SDS - PAGE , which further indicated their differences . Even in total protein , the poly - peptide composition differed significantly between the frac - tions enriched for the late Golgi complex ( Fig . 9 lane 1 , T ) , the low density endosome - like compartment ( Fig . 9 lane 2 , T ) , and the vacuole ( Fig . 9 , lane 3 , T ) . Detection of these differences was enhanced after extracting the membranes with sodium carbonate into soluble and sedimentable frac - tions . The soluble portion ( peripheral and lumenal proteins ) from each consisted of about 10 major polypeptides most of which were unique ( Fig . 9 , lanes 1 - 3 , S ) . The polypeptide composition from the sodium carbonate pellets ( 10 - 16 differ - ent proteins ) was also unique among these fractions with the most conspicuous difference observed in the 25 - 26 kD range ( Fig . 9 , lanes 1 - 3 , P ) . Together with the morphology of these membranes ( Fig . 8 ) , the polypeptide composition suggested that the low density endosome - like compartment was distinct from both the late Golgi and the vacuole . Discussion The vectorial movement of newly - synthesized yeast vacuolar proteins , like CP¥ , through the early secretory pathway was initially characterized in the sec mutants ( Stevens et al . , 1982 ) . Those studies provided the first definitive evidence that CPY went from the ER to the Golgi complex before delivery to the vacuole . The yeast Golgi complex , although morphologically elusive , is composed of functional subcom - partments like the mammalian organelle ( Bowser et al . , 1991 ; Cunningharn et al . , 1989 ; Franzusoff and Schekman , 1989 ) . Specific carbohydrate modification , temperature sen - sitive transport blocks , and better marker proteins have al - lowed functional dissection of the yeast Golgi complex . For example , the early Golgi sect block ( Franzusoff and Schek - man , 1989 ) , acquisition of od , 3 - 1inked mannose residues , and transit through the Kex2p - containing late Golgi ( Gra - ham and Emr , 1991 ) , all occur in separate Golgi subcom - partments . The identification of a distinct fractionation pat - tern for p2CPY in this study might have suggested the existence of yet another Golgi subcompartment distal to the Kex2p - containing compartment . However , the evidence sup - ports models that have predicted the presence of an endosome - like organelle between the Golgi and the vacuole ( Seeger and Payne , 1992 ; Raymond et al . , 1992 ) . Clarification of the vacuolar protein delivery pathway was possible through the use of yeast mutants , a mutant form of CPY , subcellular fractionation techniques , and a specific in - tercompartmental reconstitution assay . From the results ob - tained in this analysis , the model for localization of vacuolar proteins , like CPY , is shown in Fig . 10 . This model builds upon the previous demonstration that p2CPY transits through the Kex2p - containing late Golgi compartment and confirms this as the site for sorting vacuolar precursors away from pro - teins destined for secretion ( Graham and Emr , 1991 ) . How - ever , for the first time a new compartment distal to the late Golgi is demonstrated to exist in the yeast vacuolar protein delivery pathway . After 2pCPY travels through the late Golgi , the precursor localizes to a post - Golgi , prevacuolar compartment rather than being sorted directly to the vacu - ole . Proteolytic maturation of p2CPY occurs after delivery from the prevacuolar compartment to the vacuole . The pre - vacuolar compartment is most likely an endosome because endocytosed u - factor appears to colocalize with this or - ganelle after internalization at 15°C , conditions that slow transport from the cell surface to the vacuole . This suggests that endocytic and biosynthetic protein traffic to the yeast vacuole converge at a common compartment , analogous to the late endosome in mammalian ceils ( Griffiths et al . , 1988 ) . This refined model for protein transport to the vacuole rests on several lines of evidence . ( a ) The physical separation of organelle ( s ) that contain p2CPY from both the late - Golgi marker , Kex2p , and the vacuole markers alkaline phospha - tase and mCPY indicates the prevacuolar compartment is distinct . Equilibrium sucrose gradient analysis establishes the p2CPY - containing prevacuolar compartment to have a density of ' ~ 1 . 12 g / ml , the late Golgi ~ 1 . 16 g / ml , and the vacuole no more than 1 . 06 g / ml . ( b ) Pulse / chase analysis demonstrated a kinetic relationship between the Golgi com - plex and the prevacuolar compartment . At early chase times , p2CPY fractionated with the higher density late Golgi Kex2p compartment but at later chase points p2CPY frac - tionated with the lower density prevacuolar compartment . This places the order of the p2CPY - containing low density prevacuolar compartment after the late - Golgi but before the The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 121 , 1993 1254 Plasma Vacuole ~ Membrane a - 1 . 6 it - L2 { I a - l , 3 ~ Figure 10 .

See Discussion for other details . vacuole . ( c ) or - factor fractionated with the same density as the prevacuolar compartment after internalization at 150C , which suggests that this organelle is endosome - like rather than a transport vesicle intermediate between the late Golgi and the vacuole . ( d ) Reconstitution analysis demonstrated a strong correlation between highly efficient vacuolar delivery of p2CPY in vitro and its localization to the low density prevacuolar compartment in vivo . ( e ) Sorting ' determinants in the propeptide of CPY are required to localize p2CPY in the low density prevacuolar compartment . The amount of Golgi - modified CPY from the Q ~ K missorting mutant was significantly decreased ( three - to fourfold ) in this intermedi - ate compartment . However , the mutant CPY cofractionated with the late - Golgi Kex2p marker . ( f ) Electron microscopy revealed that the prevacuolar organelle fraction was com - posed of 250 - 400 nm compartments distinct from both the larger vacuole and the smaller and tubule - like Golgi com - partments . This data also corroborates that this prevacuolar compartment is most likely not a transport vesicle by virtue of its relatively large , nonuniform size . ( g ) Polypeptide com - position is another independent level of criteria to establish the prevacuolar compartment as being distinct from both the Golgi and the vacuole . The subcellular fractionation results presented in this study independently confirm earlier work that implicates the Kex2p - containing late Golgi as the sorting site for soluble vacuolar proteins from the default pathway of secretion ( Gra - ham and Emr , 1991 ) . Compelling evidence was obtained with analysis of two different components that affect sorting ( a ) a point mutation in the propeptide sorting signal of CPY and ( b ) the vpsl5 temperature - sensitive vacuolar protein sorting mutant . In both cases , Golgi - modified p2CPY co - fractionates with the Kex2p - containlng late Golgi indicating that events within this compartment promote proper protein sorting to the vacuole away from the secretory pathway . In - terestingly , introduction of a positive charge in the CPY propeptide ( Q ~ K ) not only results in substantial missorting to the cell surface , but also a kinetic delay in transport through the late Golgi complex . Together these observations indicate that the Kex2p - containing late Golgi compartment functions as the yeast cell equivalent of the mammalian TGN ( Griffiths and Simons , 1986 ; Mellman and Simons , 1992 ) . With this in mind , the vpsl5 temperature sensitive transport block provides the first demonstration for a cytoplasmic fac - tor , the VPSI5 protein kinase , that functions in the regulation of protein sorting in the late Golgi complex . Several points about the kinetics of vacuolar delivery in yeast become clear from our analysis of sorting and trans - port . The data suggest that the rate limiting event in p2CPY delivery to the vacuole is not in movement from the od , 3 marmosyltransferase to the Kex2p compartment or from the Kex2p compartment to the endosome but rather in transport from the endosome to the vacuole . Sucrose gradient frac - tionation of p2CPY from different chase points shows that cofractionation with the late Golgi marker , Kex2p , is very transient . Over multiple time points only small amounts of wild - type p2CPY or p2PrA were observed to cofractionate with the Kex2p - containing late Golgi ( fractions 12 and 13 ; Vida and Emr , unpublished results ) . This suggests that the kinetics ofp2CPY movement from the dense Kex2p - contain - ing late Golgi compartment to the less dense prevacuolar compartment are relatively fast . In contrast , a large pool of p2CPY cofractionates with the prevacuolar endosome com - pa ~ - hi ~ ent at several chase points . Thus , the slowest step in vacuolar delivery of CPY is most likely not movement from the late Golgi to the endosome , but rather transport from the endosome to the vacuole . Importantly , p2CPY was not ob - served to cofractionate with vacuolar marker proteins , indi - cating that proteolytic maturation is not rate limiting . Techniques to resolve yeast organelles on sucrose gra - dients are fast - becoming the standard method to characterize the subcellular location of an unknown protein ( Walworth et al . , 1989 ; McCaffrey et al . , 1991 ; Bowser et al . , 1991 ; New - man et al . , 1992 ) . The fractionation behavior of newly - synthesized p2CPY or p2PrA delineate the compartments in - volved with vacuolar delivery of these precursor proteins . For CPY , the pl form generally follows the fractionation be - havior of the ER while the p2 form fractionates with the Golgi complex and the endosome - like prevacuolar compart - ment . No stable resident marker proteins for this low density compartment exist yet , only the transient passage of Golgi - modified vacuolar precursors and internalized or - factor through this compartment permit its detection . The steady state amount of both these transient markers within this compart - ment is negligible . Future efforts will be directed toward the identification of integral membrane proteins associated with the prevacuolar endosomal compartment to serve as func - tional markers like the recently identified 57 - kD protein of the mammalian prelysosomal compartment ( Park et al . , 1991 ) . Interestingly , the density of this organelle in yeast ( " , , 1 . 12 g / ml ) is nearly identical to the density of the mam - malian prelysosomal compartment ( Mullock et al . , 1989 ; Park et al . , 1991 ) . The molecular mechanism for protein transport from the prelysosome to the lysosome is poorly understood . One ma - Vida et al . Prevacuolar Compartment in Yeast 1255 jor question is whether transport carder vesicles shuttle cargo between these organelles or if the late endosome " ma - tures " into a lysosome . The genetic and biochemical ap - proaches in yeast should provide insight into this problem . The reconstitution assay for measuring intercompartmental transport to the vacuole in yeast is most efficient for the step between the prevacuolar intermediate and the vacuole . The characteristics of this assay imply that a carder vesicle func - tions to transfer contents to the vacuole ( Vida et al . , 1990 ) . To demonstrate this unequivocally will require isolation of these vesicles separated from the donor compartment , the endosome , and the target organelle , the vacuole . Addition - ally , purification of the endosome - like compartment will en - able efforts to identify resident marker proteins and could permit reconstitution of vacuolar protein delivery into a cell - free donor / acceptor reaction .
