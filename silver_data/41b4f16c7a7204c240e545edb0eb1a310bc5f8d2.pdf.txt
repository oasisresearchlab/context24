Mechanism of Action of Acanthamoeba Profilin : Demonstration of Actin Species Specificity and Regulation by Micromolar Concentrations of MgCI2 PETER CHIEN - HUA TSENG and THOMAS D . POLLARD Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy , Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore , Maryland 21205 ABSTRACT Acanthamoeba profilin strongly inhibits in a concentration - dependent fashion the rate and extent of Acanthamoeba actin polymerization in 50 mM KCI . The lag phase is prolonged indicating reduction in the rate of nucleus formation . The elongation rates at both the barbed and pointed ends of growing filaments are inhibited . At steady state , profilin increases the critical concentration for polymerization but has no effect on the reduced viscosity above the critical concentration . Addition of profilin to polymerized actin causes it to depolymerize until a new steady - state , dependent on profilin concentration , is achieved . These effects of profilin can be explained by the formation of a 1 : 1 complex with actin with a dissociation constant of 1 to 4 / ~ M . MgCI2 strongly inhibits these effects of profilin , most likely by binding to the high - affinity divalent cation site on the actin . Acanthamoeba profilin has similar but weaker effects on muscle actin , requiring 5 to 10 times more profilin than with amoeba actin . Profflin is a small protein which was first isolated from lymph - oid tissue in a 1 : 1 complex with actin ( 4 ) , but its mechanism of action and its biological function are not established , in part , because profdin purified from both mammals ( 4 , 9 ; 2 ) and A canthamoeba ( 16 ) did not interact strongly with purified actin . The vertebrate profdins consist of a single polypeptide with a molecular weight , calculated from its sequence , of 15 , 220 ( 14 ) , whereas the Acanthamoeba profdin had a lower molecular weight ( ~ 12 , 000 ) as shown by gel electrophoresis . All of the purified profdins prolong the lag phase at the outset of the polymerization of monomeric actin . This led several authors to conclude that profdin inhibits the rate of actin nucleus forma - tion . There is less agreement about the effects of profflin on the extent of polymerization at steady state . It is difficult to compare the four different published studies , because there is no uniformity in the buffer conditions or the concentration or type of actin . In five published experiments using 14 to 18 tzM muscle actin in phosphate buffer with 2 mM MgCI2 or CaC12 , 8 to 12 btM profilin from brain , spleen , thymus ( 2 ) , or platelets ( 9 ) inhibited the steady - state viscosity < 20 % . With 30 pM platelet profdin there was no inhibition in 2 mM MgClz . However 34 / zM spleen , brain , or thymus profdin all inhibited the steady - state viscosity of muscle actin > 90 % in 2 mM CaCI2 ( 2 ) . There were no experiments to test whether the buffer composition ( especially the divalent cation ) might explain these differences . In the single experiment with 12 t ~ M A canthamoeba actin and 34 btM Acanthamoeba profflin in phosphate buffer THE JOURNAL OF CELL BIOLOGY - VOLUME 94 JULY 1982 213 - 218 © The Rockefeller University Press • 0021 - 9525 / 82 / 07 / 0213 / 06 $ 1 . 00 with 2 mM MgCI2 , there was no inhibition of the steady - state viscosity ( 16 ) . Although it was stated in several of these papers that profilin does not inhibit the elongation of actin fdaments , none of the experiments actually allow one to evaluate possible effects of profilin on this step . Perhaps the most definitive information available on the interaction of purified profdin with actin was obtained by Mockrin and Korn ( 12 ) . They showed that Acanthamoeba profflin increases the rate of ATP exchange between muscle actin monomers and the medium . The dependence of the reaction rate on profflin concentration allowed them to calcu - late that the proteins form a l : l complex with Kd = 4 . 7 X 10 - 5 . Other than this elegant , but indirect , assay there is no published information on the binding of profflin to actin monomers , although there is evidence that neither mammalian ( 4 ) nor A canthamoeba ( 16 ) profdin binds to actin filaments in pelleting assays . The conclusion of this brief summary is that we do not know how actin and profflin interact . To make progress towards this goal , we need detailed quantitative information about the binding of prof ' din to actin and the effects of profilin on each step in the polymerization of actin . It will be necessary to explore how each of the reaction parameters is influenced by the concentration of profflin , the species of actin , and the solution conditions . Here we have examined the effects of Acanthamoeba profflin on the nucleation rate , elongation rate and the steady - state extent of polymerization of both A cantha - 213 moeba and muscle actin . The experiments show that Acantha - moeba profdin reacts more strongly with Acanthamoeba than muscle actin and that the interaction is affected dramatically by micromolar concentrations of MgCI2 . MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials We used the following sources : Sigma Chemical Co . ( St . Louis , MO ) : grade 1 ATP ; grade 1 imidazole ; dithiothreitol ( DTT ) ; ethanolamine ; Sephadex G - 25 . Polysciences , Inc . ( Warrington , PA ) : glutaraldehyde . Pharmacia Fine Chemicals ( Piscataway , N J ) : Sephacryl S - 200 . Other chemicals were reagent grade . Methods PROTEIN PURIFICATION : Acanthamoeba profilin was purified by minor modifications of the method of Reichstein and Korn ( 16 ) and its concentration was measured by absorbance at 280 nm using E = 1 . 4 x 104 M - I cm - i ( Tseng et al . Manuscript submitted for publication ) . Acanthamoeba actin was purified by a modification of the method of Gordon et al . ( 8 ) . Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was purified from acetone powder according to MacLean - Fletcher and Pollard ( 1 I ) , a procedure which includes gel filtration as the final step . Actin concentration was measured by absorbance at 290 nm using E = 2 . 7 × 104 M - ~ cm - L Chicken muscle myosin subfragment - I ( S - l ) was prepared by a - chymotrypsin digestion according to Weeds and Pope ( 18 ) and purified by gel filtration on Sepliacryl S - 200 in 0 . 5 M KC1 , 20 mM imidazole , pH 7 , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM DTT , 3 mM sodium azide . POLYMERIZATION ASSAYS : In most cases actin polymerization was fol - lowed by measurements of the viscosity of 0 . 6 - mi samples in Ostwald capillary viscometers size 150 from Cannon Instruments ( State College , PA ) . The temper - ature was 25°C and buffer flow times were 28 to 30 s . As described in detail elsewhere ( 5 ) , the shearing in the viscometer breaks some of the actin filaments and accelerates the polymerization of bulk samples by increasing the number of ends available for growth . To keep this factor constant , measurements were made at regular intervals , usually 1 or 2 min , whenever possible . In those cases where polymerization was nucleated by preformed actin filaments , the filament concen - tration was adjusted to give both ( a ) hyperbolic plots of viscosity vs . time and ( b ) initial rates dependent on the monomer concentration . In this way viscometry could be used to give a semiquantitative data on elongation rates . The constituents of the samples were mixed in the following order : 10 - fold concentrated buffer , profllin or its buffer , water , nuclei ( if used ) , and actin monomer . The standard buffer contained 50 mM KC1 , 10 mM imldazole ( 1 M stock was pH 7 . 5 @ 25°C , but pH was 6 . 9 to 7 . 0 after dilution ) , 0 . 2 mM ATP . The actin buffer contributed , in addition , 0 . 8 mM Tris - Cl , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 0 . 08 mM CaCI , , 0 . 08 mM ATP . In some experiments MgC12 was included in the concentrations noted in figure legends . Elongation rates were also measured directly using a modification of the approach originally described by Woodrum et al . ( 19 ) . Cross - finked decorated nuclei were prepared as follows : equal concentrations ( 17 # M ) of polymerized Acanthamoeba actin and muscle S - I were mixed in 10 mM imidazole pH 7 , 2 mM MgC12 for 2 h at room temperature to allow the S - 1 to hydrolyze all of the free ATP from the actin sample and to combine with the actin filaments . The proteins were then treated with 10 mM glutaraldehyde for 8 rain followed by 50 mM ethanolamine for 10 min , both at room temperature . The cross - linked decorated fdaments were then separated from the other reactants on a 1 . 5 x 12 cm column of Sephadex G - 25 equifibrated and eluted with 50 mM KCI , 10 mM imidazole pH 7 . The fixed decorated f ' daments were fragmented by 25 passages through a 26 - gauge needle just before use . Elongation experiments were carried out by mixing reactants in a small tube in the following order : variable volumes of water , 20 / tl of 250 mM KCI , 50 mM imidazole pH 7 ; decorated nuclei ; variabW volumes of profilin and , finally , 16 pl of 24 ~ tM actin to bring the volume to 100 # 1 and start the reaction . The final sample contained 0 . 45 mg / mi of nuclei ( that is ~ 2 . 5 gM actin in decorated f ' flaments ) , 4 ~ tM actin monomer and various concentrations of profilin in 50 mM KCI , 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . Immediately after mixing samples were transferred carefully to parafilm . Glow - discharged , carbon - coated electron microscopy grids were touched to the surface of the droplet . After 15 to 60 s from the addition of monomers , the reaction was stopped by draining the sample from the grid by contact with filter paper and staining the absorbed material with 1 % uranyl acetate for 5 s . In another experiment , 1 mM MgC12 was included in the reaction mixture . Electron micrographs of random , well - stained areas were taken at 10 , 000 times with a JEOL 100 CX microscope . The length of t - daments grown from the decorated nuclei was measured on prints enlarged to 25 , 000 times . Most samples consisted of 35 to 60 filaments with a range of 5 to 88 . The sample of 5 came from a 15 - s time point , with the highest concemration ( 20 / ~ M ) of profilin where there was no growth on most of several hundred nuclei photographed . 214 RAPID COMMUNICATIONS RESULTS Polymerization from Monomeric Actin When purified Aeanthamoeba ( Fig . IA and B ) or muscle ( Fig . 1 C and D ) actin monomers are polymerized in 50 mM KCI + 1 mM MgCI2 the time course of the viscosity change is sigmoidal , because slow steps limit the initial rate of the reaction . The initial lag is shorter in MgCI2 ( Fig . 1 B and D ) , because Mg + + increases the rate of nucleation ( 6 ) without altering the polymer elongation rate . Purified Acanthamoeba profdin prolongs the initial lag phase for both types of actin with or without MgCI2 ( Fig . 1 . 4 - F ) . The duration of the lag phase depends on the concentration of prof ' din , the type of actin and the ionic conditions ( Fig . 1 E and F ) . 10 # M profflin doubles the lag phase for Acanthamoeba actin with or without 1 mM MgCI2 , but 4 to 5 times more is required to double the lag phase of muscle actin ( + MgCI2 ) . Experiments similar to this led previous investigators to con - clude that profdin from spleen ( 2 ) , Acanthamoeba ( 16 ) and platelets ( 9 ) inhibits nucleation , but all of these results are also A B 0 P 8 . 5 17 42 I : : °oL , w 0 P , eeg e , °°o ~ o non ~ z ~ 0 . 4 0 P ego o . , / o _ , o : OFT 7 I : - o - < ' : : 2° I ' - " ' ' - o I o OP 42 ~ - OP ~ so ' " i f o . o _ _ _ _ _ o , o . , i , . : . ! , • tJ ~ 0 . 2 • / Z ~ 0 . 2 A l ! ! ° : o o IDle / Profilin so 40 6o . o to so Minutes > 80i . . , : 4oT - : " " s° / O0 9 - - ? , so 4 ' 0 " Do ' , ' o ' : o Profilin FIGURE 1 Effect of profilin on the time course of gel - filtered actin monomer polymerization assayed by Ostwald capillary viscornetry .

Steady State In 50 mM KC1 , purified Acanthamoeba profilin strongly inhibits the steady state viscosity ofAcanthamoeba actin ( Fig . 1 C , inset ) and weakly inhibits the steady - state viscosity of muscle actin ( Fig . 1 C , inset ) . Muscle actin is ~ 15 times less sensitive to profilin than Acanthamoeba actin . In contrast , profdin has no effect at concentrations up to 42 / ~ M on the steady - state viscosity of either actin in 50 mM KCI with 1 mM MgCh ( Fig . 1 D , inset ) . Nearly identical resuRs are obtained when polymerization is nucleated with preformed fdaments ( see Fig . 3 , below ) . In 50 mM KCI the steady - state viscosity of 10 # M Acantha - moeba actin is inversely proportional to the profdin concentra - tion , with a 50 % reduction in viscosity at 10 / ~ M profdin ( Fig . 1A and C ) . The viscosity is lower in the presence of profilin , because the critical concentration for Acanthamoeba actin po - lymerization in 50 mM KC1 is higher ( Fig . 2A ) . The critical concentration depends on the concentration of profilin ( Table I ) . Above the critical concentration the reduced viscosity ( slope of viscosity vs actin concentration ) is the same as the control for all profilin concentrations up to at least 10 / ~ M ( Fig . 2A and other experiments not illustrated ) . Since the viscosity depends on fdament length ( 13 ) , we interpret this result to mean that profiUn has no effect on the polymer size distribution at steady state , at least when measured in a high - shear viscom - eter . Acanthamoeba profilin has no effect on the critical con - centration or the viscosity of any concentration of Acantha - moeba actin tested in 50 mM KCI with 1 mM MgC12 ( Fig . 1 D , inset , and 2 B ) . Elongation Two independent assays demonstrate that Acanthamoeba profdin is a strong inhibitor of Acanthamoeba actin fdament elongation in 50 mM KC1 . First , in a nucleated polymerization assay where the initial rate of the viscosity change is propor - tional to the actin monomer concentration above the critical concentration ( Fig . 3 A ) , profilin reduced the initial rate of the viscosity change in a concentration - dependent fashion ( Fig . 3 B , C , and inset ) .

The concentration of complex was calculated from the observed critical concen - tration minus the critical concentration without profilin assuming a 1 : 1 ( A , ® ) ( P , ) complex . Free profilin is total profilin minus complex . KD - - . In 50 ( AP ) mM KCI A1 = = 1 . 40 . In 50 mM KCI , 1 mM MgCI2 A1 ® = 0 . 35 . times from 0 to 60 rain before adding nuclei and KCI had no effect on the time course of the viscosity change . In 50 mM KC1 , 1 mM MgCh high concentrations of protlin inhibit the initial rate of the viscosity change of nucleated samples ( Fig . 3 C ) . About five times more profilin is required than in 50 mM KCI without MgCI2 . Profflin also inhibits the rate of the viscosity change when muscle actin monomers are used with the nuclei ( Fig . 3 D ) , but the effect is weaker . Compared with the effect on the nucleated polymerization of Acanthamoeba actin , five to seven times more prot ' din is required for an equivalent effect on muscle actin . Second , we measured the growth of actin from the ends of myosin S - 1 decorated nuclei by electron microscopy ( Fig . 4 ) . Under the conditions of the assay the length of new polymer at the barbed end was proportional to the time of incubation . In 50 mM KCI , profilin inhibited the rate of barbed end elongation ( Fig . 4 ) even more strongly than in the viscometric assay ( Fig . 3 C , inset ) 1 . In another experiment , 10 # M profdin inhibited barbed end elongation of 4 # M actin 85 % by electron microscopy . Profilin also inhibited elongation at the pointed end because no growth was seen there on hundreds of nuclei . However , events at the pointed end were impossible to quan - titate using these nuclei , because the growth rate there is so slow even in the controls . In 50 mM KC1 with 1 mM MgCI2 , there was no inhibition of the elongation rate by 8 or 16 # M profdin ( Fig . 4 ) . Depolymerization When profdin is added to Acanthamoeba actin fdaments at steady state in 50 mM KCI the ffflaments will depolymerize ( Fig . 5 ) . After an extended period of time required to reach a new equilibrium , the viscosity plateaus at the same value as a It is not expected that the electron microscopy and viscometric assays of elongation should agree , because the viscometric assay is only semiquantitative due to concurrent nucleation and filament breakage , both of which increase the rate of the viscosity change . An additional factor contributing to the difference is the concentration of actin . When the total actin monomer concentration is 4 # M ( Fig . 4 ) compared with 10 / ~ M ( Fig . 2 ) , less than half as much profflin is required to reduce the free monomer concentration to less than the critical concentration .

Effect of MgCI2 As noted in the previous sections , MgCl2 has a strong effect on the polymerization of mixtures of profflin and Acantha - moeba actin . In its absence , profflin inhibits the growth rate and extent of polymerization , but while in 1 ram MgC12 there is no effect on the steady - state viscosity and a weak effect on the growth rate . These effects of MgCI2 occur at very low concentrations . In the nucleated polymerization assay , 20 / ~ M profflin reduces the initial rate of the viscosity change to approximately zero in l0 # M MgCI2 ( Fig . 6A ) but has relatively tittle effect in 1 mM MgC12 .

Inset : . a double reciprocal plot of the viscosity ( cs - 1 ) vs . MgCI2 concentration ( raM - l ) . The Ko is 33 / ~ M MgCI2 . The steady - state viscosity of actin - profdin mixtures is even more sensitive to the MgCI2 concentration ( Fig . 6B ) . The steady - state viscosity after 18 - h incubation has a hyperbolic dependence on MgC12 concentration . A double reciprocal plot ( Fig . 6B , inset ) is linear and gives a KD of 33 / tM MgCI2 . In another experiment ( Fig . 6A ) the steady - state viscosities at - tained in 10 to 30 rain for 50 , 75 , 100 , and 1 , 000 pM MgCI2 fit on the same hyperbola as the 18 - h data and give a linear reciprocal plot with a KD of 38 pM . Note that these samples contained both 100 / ~ M ATP and 100 / zM CaCI2 in addition to the MgCI2 . The low concentrations of MgCI2 giving a half - maximal effect on the profflin action are insufficient by themselves to cause the polymerization of the actin , but they do affect the critical concentration in 50 mM KCI . The critical concentration for Acanthamoeba actin polymerization in 50 mM KCI is 1 . 4 # M without MgC12 and 0 . 35 / ~ M in 1 mM MgC12 . The depend - ence of the critical concentration on MgCI2 concentration between 0 . 025 and 1 mM gives a linear double reciprocal plot ( I / MgC12 vs . I / Keq ) with KD = 35 / ~ M MgCI2 . DISCUSSION To summarize our findings , in 50 mM KCI , Acanthamoeba profdin prolongs the lag phase at the outset of Acanthamoeba actin polymerization , decreases the elongation rate , increases the critical concentration for polymerization , and depolymer - izes preformed actin filaments . In 50 mM KCI , I mM MgC12 , Acanthamoeba profdin has a weak effect on the lag phase and the rate of elongation but no effect on the steady - state extent ofAcanthamoeba actin polymerization . Acanthamoeba profdin affects muscle actin polymerization in a similar way , but the prorilin concentration must be five to ten times higher for an equivalent effect . Our observations on profflin effects on the steady - state po - lymerization of actin are consistent with previous work re - viewed in the Introduction . Reichstein and Korn ( 16 ) probably did not observe an effect of 34 pM Acanthamoeba profiUn on Acanthamoeba actin because of the 2 mM MgCI2 in the buffer . Grumet and Lin ( 9 ) may not have observed an effect of 30 / ~ M platelet profdin because they used muscle actin in 2 mM MgCI2 for their assay . Blikstad et al . ( 2 ) found that high concentrations of mammalian profilin reduce the steady - state viscosity of muscle actin presumably because they used CaCI2 instead of MgCI2 in their buffer . To explain the mechanism of action of profilin quantitatively it will be necessary to measure directly the stoichiometry and affinity of profilin binding to the two actins under various conditions . However , some estimates of these parameters can be made from the profdin concentration dependence of the critical concentration of steady - state polymerization ( Table I ) and of the elongation rate ( Table II ) using Eq . I . ( A1 ) ( Pf ) KD - - - - ( AP ) ( 1 ) In the case where polymerization was allowed to go to steady state , the free actin monomer concentration ( AI " ) is simply the critical concentration for actin polymerization in that buffer without profilin . The concentration of actin - profilin complex ( AP ) is the critical concentration observed in the presence of profdin minus A : ® . Free profdin ( Pf ) is obtained by difference , assuming a 1 : 1 complex between actin and profdin , Since we have been unable to detect by a pelleting assay the binding of profilin to actin filaments under the conditions of our experi - TABLE II Calculation of Actin - Profilin Affinity in 50 mM KCl from the Polymerization Rate Experiment ( Fig . 4 ) Polymeri - Total zation Free Free profilin rate actin Complex profilin KD ~ M s - ~ ~ M ~ M ~ M ~ M 0 18 . 6 3 . 8 0 - - - - 2 . 5 10 . 9 2 . 8 1 . 0 1 , 5 4 . 0 5 . 0 4 . 0 1 . 9 1 . 9 3 . 1 3 . 1 7 . 5 1 . 4 1 . 6 2 . 2 5 . 3 3 . 7 The concentration of free actin monomer was estimated using the knowledge that the polymerization rate is directly proportional to the actin concentration above the critical concentration ( 1 . 4 pM ) where dl / dt = 0 . Using the rate in the absence of profilin the slope of this line is k + = 7 . 8 x 10 6 M - 1 s - 1 . The concentration of complex is the difference between the total and free actin concentrations . Free profilin is the difference between the concentrations of ( A , ) ( P , ) total profiiin and complex . This assumes a 1 : 1 stoichiometry . K v = ~ ( AP ) ments , we assume that no profdin is bound to filaments . In the growth rate experiment the concentrations of free actin mon - omer , complex and free profdin could be estimated directly from the growth rates ( Table II ) . The stoichiometry of actin and profdin in the complex is the major unknown in this analysis and will have to be established by direct binding studies . We chose 1 : 1 stoichiometry for this analysis because mammalian profilactin consists ofa 1 : 1 ratio of the two proteins ( 3 , 4 ) . Another note of caution is that the analysis in both Tables I and II disregards any binding of prof ' flin to actin which does not alter the polymerization process . The results of these calculations are summarized in Tables I and II . The apparent KD ' s for profdin binding to amoeba actin in 50 mM KC1 are between 1 and 4 pM . The apparent affinity is strongly dependent on the MgC12 concentration , with the KD being unmeasurably large in l mM MgCI2 . For muscle actin we have less data , but the apparent affinity is much less , with the KD > 30 t ~ M . Most of our observations can be explained by a simple mechanism of action in which profflin binds to actin monomers at a site or sites which inhibit polymerization . These sites are probably buried in the filament , because profilin does not bind to filarnents . Alternatively , profilin might fail to bind to ex - posed sites on the filament due to the conformation of the actin in the filament . We favor the former model , because binding to a buried site would explain by steric interference why the actin - profdin complex would not polymerize . A simple monomer sequestering mechanism does not com - pletely explain why the lag phase is so much more sensitive to profdin than elongation rate or steady - state extent of polym - erization . This discrepancy is especially clear in MgCI2 . Hope - fully , this will become clear when we learn more about nuclea - tion and other reactions which occur during the lag phase . The great difference in the affinity ofAcanthamoeba profilin for Acanthamoeba and muscle actins is fascinating , because of the sequences of the two actins are so similar ( 15 ) . The NH2 - terminal sequence of Acanthamoeba actin has not been com - pleted , but most of the primary structures of the two actins are nearly identical . There are 14 isopolar substitutions and one charge difference , a histidine at position 228 in the amoeba actin where muscle actin has an alanine . We speculate that profdin may bind near this histidine or possibly to the NH2 - terminus . This should eventually become clear from crystallo - graphic studies ( 3 ) . The profound effect of MgCI2 on Acanthamoeba actin - pro - RAPID COMMUN JCATIONS 217 filin interaction occurs at low MgCh concentrations with a haft - maximal effect at about 35 / ~ M Mg + + in the presence of 100 # M CaATP . Most likely this is due to Mg + + binding to the high - affinity divalent cation site on the actin ( 7 ) . On the other hand , a direct effect of MgCI2 on profilin cannot be ruled out at the present time . These results suggest that profilin binds weakly or not at ati to Mg + + - actin , a matter which deserves further study because of the implications for the action of profdin in the cell , where it is generally assumed that there is Mg + + bound to actin . Our new information about profdin makes it clear that it is similar to other actin monomer sequestering proteins such as DNase - I ( 10 ) , brain depolymerizing protein ( 1 ) , and vitamin D - binding protein ( 17 ) which all affect actin polymerization by simply binding to actin monomers in a way that prevents them from polymerizing . For the most part , the differences in their action are accounted for by the affinity of the sequestering protein for actin relative to the equilibrium constant for the polymerization reaction . Compared with the other proteins , profflin has a lower affinity for actin , especially muscle actin , and is very sensitive to MgCh . Until in vivo studies are carried out , the function of profdin in the cell will remain speculative , especially since we know so little about Mg + + in the amoeba . However , the available bio - chemical data indicate that profdin might function as an actin monomer buffer in the cytoplasm ) We thank John Cooper for his advice on these experiments , Dan Kiehart for the myosin $ 1 , and Drs .
