Biophysical Journal Volume 72 January 1997 445 - 448 Atomic Force Microscope Imaging Contrast Based on Molecular Recognition M . Ludwig , W . Dettmann , and H . E . Gaub Lehrstuhl fur Angewandte Physik , Ludwig Maximilians Universitat , 80799 Munchen , Germany ABSTRACT The contrast in atomic force microscope images arises from forces between the tip and the sample . It was shown recently that specific molecular interaction forces may be measured with the atomic force microscope ; consequently , we use such forces to map the distribution of binding partners on samples . Here we demonstrate this concept by imaging a streptavidin pattern with a biotinylated tip in a novel imaging mode called affinity imaging . In this mode topography , adhesion , and sample elasticity are extracted online from local force scans . We show that this technique allows the separation of these values and that the measured binding pattern is based on specific molecular interactions . INTRODUCTION The scanning probe microscopes ( Binnig et al . , 1986 ; Bin - nig et al . , 1983 ; Hansma et al . , 1988 ) have evolved into universal instruments for experiments on the nanoscopic length scale ( Wickramasinghe , 1990 ) . Particularly in the life sciences , the atomic force microscope ( AFM ) has been estab - lished as the most widely used variant of this family ( Engel , 1991 ; Hansma and Hoh , 1994 ; Radmacher et al . , 1992 ) . A broad spectrum ofkey experiments has demonstrated its ability to image biological samples under quasi - physiological condi - tions at length scales ranging from the cellular ( Henderson et al . , 1992 ) to the molecular level ( Bezanilla et al . , 1994 ; Hoh et al . , 1991 ; Muller et al . , 1996 ; Weisenhom et al . , 1990 ) . More - over , dynamic processes have been investigated as they occur again on both macroscopic ( Fritz et al . , 1994 ) and nanoscopic dimensions ( Radmacher et al . , 1994 ) . Molecular interactions can now be studied with unparalleled sensitivity and resolution ( Dammer et al . , 1995b ; Florin et al . , 1994a ; Lee et al . , 1994b ; Moy et al . , 1994 ) . Image formation in AFM is based on forces between the tip and the sample . It was recognized early on that under certain conditions , the different contributions may be sepa - rated by suitable instruments : sample viscoelasticity by force modulation microscopy ( Florin et al . , 1994b ) or force volume mapping ( Cleveland et al . , 1994 ) , lateral forces by scanning friction microscopy ( Erlandsson et al . , 1988 ) and Coulomb forces in aqueous environments by electric dou - ble - layer imaging ( Manne and Gaub , 1995 ) , just to name a few of them . Recently , specific adhesion forces were mea - sured with the AFM in so - called force scans ( Chilkoti et al . , 1995 ; Dammer et al . , 1995 ; Dammer et al . , 1996 ; Florin et al . , 1994a ; Lee et al . , 1994 ; Moy et al . , 1994 ; Hinterdorfer et al . , 1996 ) . In this paper we have expanded this approach toward mapping speciflc adhesion forces by affinity imaging . Received for publication 12 April 1996 and infinal form 9 October 1996 .

Several de - rivatives and many thermodynamic and structural data are available . The unbinding forces have been measured by several groups ( Chilkoti et al . , 1995 ; Dammer et al . , 1995 , 1996 ; Florin et al . , 1994a ; Lee et al . , 1994a ; Moy et al . , 1994 ) and were corroborated by molecular dynamic calcula - tions ( Grubmuller et al . , 1996 ; Schulten , personal communication ) . Here we have used this molecular pair to demonstrate the concept of affinity imaging with the AFM . For this purpose a pattern of streptavidin , similar to the one reported by Mazzola and Fodor ( 1995 ) , was made as follows : after silanization of standard glass cover slides with epoxysilane { 2 % [ 3 - ( 2 , 3 - epoxypropoxy ) - propyl ] trimethoxysilane in 2 - propanol } for 5 min , the slides were dried at 70°C for 1 h , washed with 2 - propanol , and again dried at room temperature . After incubating in a dextran solution ( 30 wt % dextran T500 in MilliQ H20 ) for about 20 h ( LofAs , 1995 ; LMas and Johnson , 1990 ) , a pattern of 200 A - thick gold patches was deposited by evaporating through an electronmicroscope grid ( 2000 mesh , Plano , Mar - burg , Germany ) . Then the hydroxy groups of the dextran were converted into hydrocarboxy groups by adding bromoacetic acid ( 1 M bromoacetic acid in 2 M sodium hydroxide ) for 16 h . N - hydroxysuccinimide ( NHS ) groups were added by incubating the samples in a solution of EDAC [ 1 - ethyl - 3 - ( 3 - dimethylamino - propyl ) carbodiimide hydrochloride ] and NHS ( 0 . 2 M EDAC and 0 . 05 M NHS ) for 30 min . The lysine groups in the streptavidin ( 300 , ug / ml streptavidin in 0 . 01 M sodium acetate at pH 5 . 0 , Bohringer Mannheim , Tutzing , Germany ) were allowed to bind to the NHS - activated dextran for - 12 h . Finally the glass cover slides were washed in an ethanolamine hydrochloride solution to react the active esters and to remove free streptavidin ( 1 M ethanolamine hydrochloride adjusted to pH 8 . 5 with sodium hydroxide ) . To avoid unspecific adhesion to the gold patches , they were blocked with bovine serum albumin ( 1 mg / ml in phosphate buffered saline ) . The tip was functionalized in the following way : first the SiO " layer of the standard commercially available Si3N4 cantilever ( Digital Instruments , Santa Barbara , USA ) was silanized with dimethyl - dichlor - silane . Then it was incubated in 0 . 1 mg biotin - bovine serum albumin ( BBSA ) in 1 ml phosphate buffered saline at 4°C for 24 h . The cantilever was then rinsed extensively with MilliQH2O to remove free reagents . Unless otherwise noted all chemicals were purchased from Sigma ( Deisenhofen , Germany ) . Adhesion imaging Recently several groups have suggested ways to image adhesion by mod - ulating the imaging force and analyzing the resulting response in the deflection signal ( van der Werf et al . , 1994 ) . However , because we had 445 Volume 72 January 1997 NH - 3 0 N o ~ ~ ~ ~ 0 0 0 .

To speed up the imaging process , we did not follow the route suggested by Cleveland et al . ( 1994 ) to first record force volumes and then to extract adhesion images offline . We developed a scheme for the online analysis of the force - distance curve taken at each point which works as follows : while lowering and raising the functionalized tip of our home - built scanned stylus - type instrument , the deflection of the cantilever , which is propor - tional to the force between tip and sample , is recorded . Between two force scans the data are analyzed and the sample height , the adhesion between the tip and the sample , and the elasticity of the sample are extracted . The minimum time required for a force scan was 60 ms , the maximal amplitude was 3 , gm , resulting in a maximal speed of the cantilever of 5X 10 - 5 m / s . The force scans were stopped and truncated in the case that the maximum indentation force between tip and sample exceeded a threshold value , in this case 5 nN . The online data analysis was performed as follows : first the approach contact ( point B , Fig . 2 a ) was determined by subtracting the measured approach track from the line between point A and point C . Points C and A are the start and the end point of the approach curve . Then the minimum of the difference curve was determined . The z - coordinate of the minimum was taken as the height signal . The elasticity of the tip - sample interaction was derived from the slope of the line AB , following the analysis given in Radmacher et al . ( 1993 , 1995 ) and Weisenhorn et al . ( 1993 ) . For the extraction of the adhesion force , the minimum of the retract trace D was projected onto the line BC , and the difference of the deflection values was used to calculate the adhesion force . In the case of faster force scans ( t < 40 ms ) the hysteresis of the piezo required a separate analysis of retract and approach curves . These three extracted values were then stored and displayed in separate gray scale windows . The spring constant of the cantilever was determined in each experiment using the thermal noise technique reported earlier ( Florin et al . , 1995 ) . Values of 60 ± 5 mN / m were obtained with the cantilevers used here . The piezo was calibrated with standard calibration grids . Typical data acquisition rates in this mode are - 17 min per frame with 128 X 128 pixels . Examples for typical force scans are given in Fig . 2 b . The traces show the differences in elasticity between the gold - coated areas of the pattern and the uncovered dextran . The only trace that shows significant adhesion is the one between the biotin tip and the streptavidin surface . Note that in this case the unbinding occurs in several steps . Our algorithm will detect the highest step and take it as the adhesion value . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In Fig . 3 the images are given that were recorded on the avidin pattern with a biotin tip . Fig . 3 a shows the topog - raphy image of the pattern . Clearly visible are the elevated gold squares that were evaporated onto the substrate . The height step corresponds to the deposited film thickness . In the affinity image ( Fig . 3 b ) these squares are low in affinity , whereas the areas that where covered by the meshes of the grid show high affinity . The adhesion histogram ( Fig . 3 e ) shows that the adhesion has a broad distribution and is centered at about 1000 pN . Taking into account that the unbinding force of individual molecular pairs is 250 pN , this adhesion seems to be caused by several molecular pairs in parallel . Inasmuch as the instrument used in this study is not sensitive enough to resolve the binding forces with the necessary accuracy , and the anchoring of the molecular partners had a high spring constant , we did not attempt here to discriminate among individual unbinding events . To confirm that the measured adhesion image is due to specific molecular recognition , the sample was blocked by adding an excess of free biotin ( ImmunoPure Biotin , Pierce , e ) 2500 - . , 1500 - W3 500 - L o 0 600 1200 Adhesion [ pN ] f ) 250011 11 * W 1500 - I - 0 600 1200 Adhesion [ pN ] FIGURE 3 Affinity image of the streptavidin / gold pattern showing the topography images ( a and c ) as well as the affinity images ( b and d ) before and after blocking with free biotin . Adhesion histograms of images b and d are shown in e andf , respectively . USA ) . Under these conditions virtually no contrast was measured in the affinity image ( Fig . 3 d ) , whereas the topography contrast did not change ( Fig . 3 c ) . To show that the tip was still functional , we tested it on streptavidin - labeled agarose beads . Here we found adhesion again , which we could block by adding free streptavidin . It should be noted here , however , that in many cases the tip gradually lost its sensitivity with the half - lifetime of a few images . Preliminary experiments ( data not shown here ) have revealed that in most cases the tip is not damaged , but rather blocked by streptavidin that was only loosely at - tached to the sample . A thorough and extensive washing helped in most cases to circumvent this problem . CONCLUDING REMARKS Affinity imaging has the potential to become a very versa - tile AFM imaging mode for a broad range of samples in life sciences . Here we have demonstrated that a well - defined pattern of strongly interacting molecular partners can be imaged with satisfying contrast and in a reasonable image acquisition time . An improvement in tip stability , enhanced sensitivity , and faster image acquisition are desirable to apply this technique to a wider range of " real " samples , e . g . , markers on live cells . The lateral resolution is given by the 447 Ludwig et al . 448 Biophysical Journal Volume 72 January 1997 length of the spacers on the tip and the geometry of the tip . Luckily , measuring weaker binding forces is , at least in principle , easier at higher unbinding rates , so that improving this part of the experiment seems to be only an issue of technology . A basic limitation , however , is to be expected in the case of membrane - bound surface markers of cells . Several groups have shown ( Evans et al . , 1991 ; Leckband et al . , 1995 ) that above several tens of pN , the membrane anchors of the molecules are extracted from the lipid moiety of the mem - brane . This is an additional reason to further develop this promising technique toward the detection of smaller forces .
