This study used secondary data ( N = 933 ) from a mental health clinic serving homeless adults . Primary outcomes were the number and types of self - reported medical conditions and medications . About half ( 52 . 60 % ) of participants were taking one or more medications ( mean = 1 . 67 ; SD = 2 . 30 ) , most commonly antidepressants , antipsychotics , and anticon - vulsants . Most frequently reported medical conditions were headaches / migraines , hypertension , and arthritis with a mean of 3 . 09 ( SD = 2 . 74 ) conditions . Age and sex were significant predictors of the number of medical conditions . Age and the length of time homeless were significant predictors of the number of medications taken . Results suggest that those who are older and have been homeless longer appear to be increased risk for health problems and may need more medications to manage these conditions . Keywords Homeless · Medication use · Mental health · Co - morbidities · Health care Introduction Persons who are homeless and struggle with psychiatric disorders often have multiple comorbid medical problems , which can lead to poor quality of life and make the treat - ment of their psychiatric disorder more complex . Compared to the general population , those experiencing homelessness tend to have worse overall health status , suffer from higher rates of both chronic and acute disease , and may be manag - ing multiple chronic health conditions ( Fazel et al . 2014 ; Lebrun - Harris et al . 2013 ; Schanzer et al . 2007 ; Sun et al . 2012 ) . In a recent study of over 25 , 000 people experiencing homelessness , about one - fourth of those who were unshel - tered reported having a chronic medical illness other than a mental illness ( Montgomery et al . 2016 ) . Others have found higher rates of co - morbidity with the largest numbers among veterans ( Schinka et al . 2016 ; Weber et al . 2013 ) . Chronic medical conditions frequently reported among individuals who lack housing include cardiovascular disease , diabetes , skin disorders , dental and periodontal disease , HIV / AIDS , sexually transmitted infections , chronic obstructive pulmo - nary disease , and tuberculosis ( Victor 1997 ; Hwang 2001 ; Barnes et al . 1996 ; Jones et al . 2009 ; Allen et al . 1994 ; Zolopa et al . 1994 ; Culhane et al . 2001 ) . Other commonly reported chronic health conditions among the homeless include hearing and vision difficulty , arthritis , and podiatric problems ( Goss et al . 2003 ; Wiersma et al . 2010 ; Padgett and Struening 1992 ) . The burden of managing a mental illness and one or more physical health problems can be challenging and can lead to increased mortality ( Pascual et al . 2008 ; Beijer and Andreas - son 2010 ; Fazel et al . 2008 ; Nordentoft and Wandall - Holm 2003 ; Hwang et al . 1998 ; Barrow et al . 1999 ; Babidge et al . 2001 ; Beijer et al . 2011 ; Nielsen et al . 2011 ) . Morbidity and mortality are concerns for the homeless , particularly as the number of older adults who are homeless increases ( Davidson 2016 ) . Others have found that the mortality rate for home - less adults is almost 4 times higher than the general popula - tion ( Hibbs et al . 1994 ) . Life expectancy is lowest for sin - gle homeless adults ( 64 . 2 years for males and 69 . 6 years for * Elizabeth Mayfield Arnold Liz .

Females and those who have been homeless for more than five years may have increased risk of mortality ( Montgomery et al . 2016 ) . The problems associated with a medical condi - tion itself are often further complicated by the stressors and vulnerabilities associated with homelessness . For example , homeless individuals with cardiovascular disease may have elevated traditional and non - traditional risk factors that cause difficulties in diagnosing and managing the disease that can lead to increased mortality ; programs tailored to the homeless population may be an effective means to address these dispari - ties ( Baggett et al . 2018 ) . Despite the complex medical problems that are common among the homeless , little is known about the use of medica - tions by these individuals . A handful of studies of medica - tion use among the homeless in urban areas and in institutions have shown that anti - hypertensives , cholesterol modifying agents , pain relievers , nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , and opioids , are the most commonly prescribed medications ( Chong et al . 2014 ; Sfeatcu et al . 2011 ; Rhoades et al . 2014 ) . Among homeless adults in Puerto Rico , Gama and colleagues found that over half ( 56 . 8 % ) of these seeking social services were taking one of more medications ( median = 2 ) with the most common being nervous system psychiatric drugs such as antipsychotics , drugs used for opiate depend - ence , and benzodiazepines ( Paudyal et al . 2017 ) . Another study found that among behavioral health clinic patients , the average number of medications reported at intake was 3 . 4 with about one - third of patients struggling with adherence ( Bag - gett et al . 2018 ) . Homeless individuals may both intentionally and unintentionally fail to adhere to recommendations to take medications , which may be impacted by their perceptions of the consequences of non - adherence , the goals of treatment , and the impact of environmental factors ( Paudyal et al . 2017 ) . Homeless individuals face the challenge of not only obtaining a medication , a tremendous challenge if one is uninsured , as well as storing the medication safely . This paper focuses on the following research questions : ( 1 ) What are the self - reported medical conditions of home - less adults who present for psychiatric treatment ? ( 2 ) What are the medications used by homeless adults who present for psychiatric treatment ? and ( 3 ) What are the predictors of the number of self - reported medical conditions problems and medications used ? Methods The data for this project were collected in 2009 – 2017 from a mental health clinic for homeless adults ( age 18 and older ) housed in a homeless shelter in mid - sized city in the southeastern United States . The clinic was open to anyone who was homeless in the county regardless of where they were staying , including those staying in other shelters , on the streets , or “doubled up” or “coach surfing . ” All care was provided at no costs to participants who could be self - referred or referred by another agency or health care facility . The clinic was staffed by a variety of mental health profes - sionals , including psychiatrists . Participants in the clinic ( N = 933 ) self - identified as having a mental health problem and participated in a clinic intake , a formal assessment by a mental health provider , and one or more treatment visits . As part of the intake , participants were asked to provide back - ground information that included information about their medical history and medication use at the time of entry into the clinic . Results Description of the Sample As noted in Table 1 , about two - thirds of the sample was male . Slightly more than half of the sample was African - American , single , and disabled ( via self - report ) . However , less than one - fifth were receiving disability benefits . About two - thirds of participants were uninsured . The average age of participants was 41 . 89 ( SD = 11 . 60 ) . Participants had been homeless an average of 2 . 57 years ( SD = 5 . 41 ) . Medical Conditions The average number of medical conditions reported at base - line was 3 . 09 ( SD = 2 . 74 ) , and about three - fourths ( 80 . 97 % ) percent of the sample reported one or more medical condi - tions at the time of entry into the clinic . As noted in Table 2 , 42 unique medical conditions were reported . Headaches / migraines ( 40 . 66 % ) , hypertension ( 29 . 45 % ) , and arthritis ( 28 . 88 % ) were the most common self - reported medical con - ditions . Overall , men reported higher percentages of each medical condition reported , which may be due to the fact that the majority of the sample consisted of men . However , differences by sex were not tested for statistical significance due to concerns about family wise error rate and unequal group sizes ( Wickens and Keppel 2004 ) . Medications The average number of medications taken at the time of intake was 1 . 67 ( SD = 2 . 30 ) . Slightly more than half ( 52 . 60 % ) of the sample reported using one or more medica - tions at the time of intake . Table 3 presents data on the 27 types of medications that were reported . For both males and females the most commonly reported medications used were 887 Community Mental Health Journal ( 2020 ) 56 : 885 – 893 1 3 psychiatric medications such as antidepressants ( 22 . 42 % ) , antipsychotics , ( 15 . 97 % ) , and anticonvulsants ( 13 . 36 % ) . The most commonly used non - psychiatric medications reported were over - the - counter ( OTC ) / supplements ( 12 . 23 % ) , anti - hypertensives ( 12 . 00 % ) , and allergy medications ( 7 . 02 % ) . Statistical Models ZNIB Models : Statistical Analysis The two outcome variables for the analyses were as follows : ( 1 ) the number of self - reported medical conditions ; and ( 2 ) the number of self - reported medications taken . Both vari - ables were assessed at the time of intake . As both variables were count variables and a large proportion of participants had zero scores for these variables , a zero inflated negative binomial regression ( ZINB ) was used for the analysis . The ZINB is the preferred method of analysis when using count variables with a large proportion of participants answering zero , and when over dispersion ( i . e . , variance is greater than Table 1 Demographic characteristics ( N = 933 ) Values and percentages in this table do not include missing data N ( % ) Sex Male 633 ( 67 . 85 ) Female 300 ( 32 . 15 ) Race African - American 502 ( 53 . 80 ) Caucasian 354 ( 37 . 94 ) Unknown 51 ( 5 . 47 ) Other 23 ( 2 . 47 ) Multiracial 2 ( 0 . 21 ) Native - American 1 ( 0 . 11 ) Marital status Single 538 ( 58 . 99 ) Divorced 193 ( 21 . 16 ) Separated 96 ( 10 . 53 ) Married 58 ( 6 . 36 ) Widowed 27 ( 2 . 96 ) Self - report disabled status Yes 456 ( 51 . 12 ) No 436 ( 48 . 88 ) Receiving disability No 417 ( 82 . 09 ) Yes 91 ( 17 . 91 ) Insurance None 694 ( 77 . 80 ) Medicaid / medicare 179 ( 20 . 07 ) Private insurance 19 ( 2 . 13 ) Table 2 Self - reported medical conditions ( N = 883 ) Total N for each condition reflects missing data .

ZINB models were analyzed in R version 3 . 5 . 1 ( Team 2013 ) using the PSCL package ( Jackman 2015 ; Zeileis et al . 2008 ) . The two ZNIB models were compared to two negative binomial regression models using Vuong’s non - tested hypothesis test ( Vuong 1989 ) . The results from this analysis found that the ZNIB models fit the data better than the negative binomial regression models ( p < 0 . 001 ) . Two separate ZNIB models were examined with the number of medical conditions ( Model 1 ) and the number of medications ( Model 2 ) as the outcome variables . Table 4 presents the estimates for model 1 and 2 for the traditional negative binomial regression ( i . e . count analysis ) for pre - dicting the number of medical conditions / medications and the zero inflated logit analysis for predicting whether an individual reported no medical conditions nor any medi - cation use . For both ZNIB models , the coefficients from the ZNIB models were converted to odds ratios for easier interpretation . Model 1 Controlling for sex and the length of time homeless in the negative binomial model , as age increased , the higher the odds of comorbidity ( OR = 1 . 02 , p < 0 . 001 , CI [ 1 . 02 , 1 . 03 ] ) . In the zero inflated model , age was a significant predictor in that as the older the individual was , the lower the odds that he or she had no medical conditions after controlling for the other predictors ( OR = 0 . 97 , p = 0 . 026 , CI [ 0 . 94 , 0 . 99 ] ) . In both the negative binomial and the zero inflated models , sex was a significant predictor of the number of Table 3 Self - reported medications ( N = 883 ) For each category , two or more examples are included , but when only one is provided , there was only one drug for the category .

Being male decreased the odds of comorbidity ( binomial model ) and significantly increased the odds of having no medical conditions at all ( zero inflated model ) . Length of time homeless was not a significant pre - dictor in either analyses ( p > 0 . 05 ) . Model 2 Age was a significant predictor of the number of medica - tions taken ( OR = 1 . 02 , p < 0 . 001 , CI [ 1 . 02 , 1 . 03 ] ) . In addi - tion , the zero inflated analyses showed that as age increased within our sample , the odds of not taking any medications decreased ( OR = 0 . 98 , p = 0 . 012 , CI [ 0 . 96 , 0 . 99 ] ) when con - trolling for sex and the length of time homeless . The length of time an individual was homeless was not significant in the negative binomial analysis , but was significant in the zero inflated analysis ( OR = 1 . 06 , p = 0 . 004 , CI [ 1 . 02 , 1 . 09 ] ) . When controlling for age and sex in the zero inflated analy - sis , the longer the individual was homeless , the more likely he or she was to not be taking any medication . Sex was not a significant predictor in either analyses ( Table 4 ) . Discussion Consistent with the literature documenting poor health among persons who are homeless ( Fazel et al . 2014 ; Lebrun - Harris et al . 2013 ; Schanzer et al . 2007 ; Sun et al . 2012 ) , the majority of homeless adults in this study reported hav - ing multiple medical conditions and taking a number of different types of medications . Similar to the findings of others ( Victor 1997 ; Cohen et al . 1988 ; Nikoo et al . 2014 ) , we found a large number of individuals with hypertension , arthritis , and headaches / migraines in this sample . We were also able to classify and report 42 unique medical condi - tions in this population with the majority of these conditions being considered chronic and debilitating . Interestingly , we had higher rates of antihypertensives and diabetes medica - tions but lower rates of cholesterol lowering medications than found in another recent study of homeless adults ( Gama et al . 2014 ) . However , our rates of hypertension and diabetes were comparable to rates reported in recent meta - analysis ( 27 . 0 % and 8 . 0 % respectively for the meta - analysis com - pared to 29 . 45 % and 10 . 19 % for our sample ) ( Bernstein et al . 2015 ) . Many of the conditions reported by participants in this sample can be complex and costly to treat and may require specialists ( i . e . , cardiologists , neurologists ) who are not easily accessible by those who are homeless . In a survey of homeless adults , 73 % of respondents reported that they had at least one unmet health need , and 32 % were unable to attain needed medical or surgical care ( Baggett et al . 2010 ) . Inability to pay for needed services is a challenge for those who are homeless . For example , among hypertensive adults in New York City shelter - based clinics , Asgary and col - leagues documented that lack of insurance was associated with poorer control of hypertension ( Asgary et al . 2016 ) . As one might expect , there were several factors that appeared to impact the presence of one or more medical conditions and medication use . Our analyses showed that age significantly increased the likelihood that a homeless individual would have a medical condition and be using medication , which is consistent with previous research on Table 4 Zero inflated - negative binomial regression analysis for predicting the number of self - reported medical conditions ( Model 1 ) and the number of self - reported medications ( Model 2 ) The N for Model 1 was 832 and for Model 2 it was 833 .

Others have found that older home - less individuals ( i . e . , 50 or older ) have higher functional impairment when compared to a population cohort ( Brown et al . 2012 ) and were 3 . 6 more likely to have a chronic medi - cal condition than younger homeless individuals ( Garibaldi et al . 2005 ) . Pribish and colleagues found that increasing age was associated with worse health and noted that these problems will likely worsen as the age of the homeless popu - lation continues to increase ( Stergiopoulos and Herrmann 2003 ) . Others have asserted that homeless individuals who are 50 years of age biologically / physically appear to be 10 to 20 years older than their actual age , and those who are 50 and older should be considered elderly ( Cohen et al . 1988 ) . Even though the average age of our sample was approxi - mately 42 years of age , this assertion about the unique aging process among the homeless may explain why we found more medical conditions in the older homeless individu - als in our sample . Nonetheless , there is considerable debate within literature on what constitutes “elderly” in the home - less population ( Stergiopoulos and Herrmann 2003 ) . Interestingly , women in this sample were more likely to have one or more medical conditions as compared to men . This finding confirms previous research on sex differences in medical comorbidities among the homeless ( Pribish et al . 2018 ) . O’Carroll and O’Reilly found that homeless women reported worsening self - reported health over the past year compared to men and were more likely to have depression , asthma , and anxiety ( O’Carroll and O’Reilly 2008 ) . In other research , homeless women reported greater physical health symptoms than men ( Ritchey et al . 1991 ) . While biologi - cal and cultural factors may both contribute to this finding , it is important to note the unique challenges that home - less women face . Compared to men , homeless women are more often the victims of physical victimization and sexual victimization ( Cheng and Kelly 2008 ; Kushel et al . 2003 ) . Domestic violence is often cited as a reason for homeless - ness in women , and many homeless women report being vic - tims of this type of victimization ( Baker et al . 2010 ; Zorza 1991 ) . Thus , homeless women represent a vulnerable group within the homeless population that may not have their health care needs met . Cheng and Kelly assert that gender specific substance abuse programs are needed for homeless women with mental illness so that they can have the oppor - tunity to address many of the gender - specific issues common among this population , including abuse and trauma ( Cheng and Kelly 2008 ) . Future research on the health care needs of homeless women should also examine gender specific interventions to address the medical needs of this population which may be different from those of homeless . Furthermore , in this sample , the longer a person was homeless the less likely he or she was to report no medica - tion use . To our knowledge , no other known studies have specifically examined this issue , which does not allow for comparisons to other research . However , this finding makes sense given that the longer an individual is homeless , the more disconnected and isolated he or she may be from health services which may impact access to medications . Perceived lack of access to health care is a documented problem among the homeless ( Paudyal et al . 2017 ) . In addition , paranoia and mistrust of medications are common challenges faced by those who provide services to homeless adults with mental illness . For some conditions , there were comparable percentages of participants with a specific medical condition who were on a medication for that problem . For example , there was about a 5 % difference between the percentage of partici - pants who had a diagnosis of diabetes and the percentage who reported taking a medication for diabetes . By contrast , approximately 29 % of participants reported a diagnosis of hypertension , but about 17 % fewer reported that they were on an antihypertensive medication . Similarly , there were fairly large differences for asthma ( 16 . 64 % ) . For other con - ditions , direct comparisons cannot easily be made . For those on pain medications of some type , the exact reason for tak - ing the medication can vary . While only about 5 % reported having seizures , about 13 % were on an antiepileptic suggest - ing that these medications might be taken for other reasons such as mood stabilization . There were also conditions for which there were higher rates of medication use reported as compared to the number of individuals who reported having the condition ( e . g . , allergies ) . Overall , our findings support the notion that there may be a cycle of poverty , homelessness , and health that is highly complex and impacts the health of these individuals . Those who are homeless may cycle in and out of homelessness with varying access to financial and healthcare resources over time . Martin and colleagues ( citation ) found even those with housing insecurity ( i . e . , worry about paying for their housing ) may delay health checkups and primary care . Additionally , others have reported that when people who have been homeless obtain supported housing , the number of medical problems may decrease , but receipt of housing itself may not impact medical outcomes or health - related quality of life ( Tsai et al . 2019 ) . It may simply be too late to see improvement in ongoing health problems once housing is obtained ( Tsai et al . 2019 ) . Thus , homelessness prevention programs that also include access to free or low - cost health services may be part of the solution yet such programs typi - cally do not exist . While this study contributes to the limited existing litera - ture on the medical conditions and medication use among homeless adults , there are several limitations that must be noted . First , these data were collected from one clinic , and thus , our findings may not be generalizable to other areas , particularly large urban cities where the homeless popula - tions where access to health care may be different . Similar 891 Community Mental Health Journal ( 2020 ) 56 : 885 – 893 1 3 to the work of others who have examined the health of the homeless ( Montgomery et al . 2016 ; Weber et al . 2013 ) , we used self - report data which is subject to recall or other forms of bias . In conclusion , our findings suggest those who are home - less and living with mental illness face multiple health challenges that are exacerbated by being homeless . As pre - viously noted by others , ( Weber et al . 2013 ) this work sup - ports the need for integrated care models that allows mental and physical health needs to be treated collaboratively . The clinic where this project took place provided mental health care , but participants were referred to outside providers for non - psychiatric health services , which at times , presented challenges . Both cost and trust of the health care system played a role in whether those referred would ever access the recommended services outside of our clinic . Health services need to focus on identifying and treating problems common among the homeless , and providers should take into account the unique circumstances of this population and adapt the management of these conditions ( Fazel et al . 2014 ) . Provid - ing comprehensive health services can be costly but can help prevent the escalation of chronic health problems which in the long - term can be cost - effective and lead to improved quality of life .
