Do research subsidies crowd out private R & D of large ﬁrms ? Evidence from European Framework Programmes Florian Szücs ∗ This draft : March 13 , 2019 Abstract We evaluate whether public research subsidies are complements or substitutes to the private R & D spending of large ﬁrms . Combining data on the EC’s three most recent Framework Programmes with data on the world’s largest research companies , we use matching and difference - in - difference esti - mation to compute the causal impact of subsidies on private R & D spending . While on average , subsi - dies have not led to increased private research budgets , we identify heterogeneities across a number of sub - samples , ﬁnding that subsidies increased own R & D for smaller ﬁrms and projects as well as more R & D - intensive ﬁrms . Finally , we also ﬁnd that while its predecessors did not , Horizon 2020 successfully stimulated ﬁrms’ private R & D spending .

The goal of this endeavour has been to further European integration and cooperation , as well as to foster innovation and ensure Europe’s competitiveness in the global economy . The means to achieve this have been generously increased over the years : while the ﬁrst so - called Framework Programmes ( FPs ) in the 1980s were budgeted at less than ten billion Euros , the Seventh Framework Programme ( FP7 ) , running from 2007 to 2013 , received funding of about e 50bn , corresponding to a 41 % increase over its predecessor . Its current successor , the Horizon 2020 ( H2020 ) programme , is budgeted at e 80bn and its future successor is expected to cost more than e 100bn . The degree to which these policies have achieved their goals have been the subject of scientiﬁc debate . The question of whether cooperation was successfully increased has been addressed by the literature on knowledge spillovers ( Kantor and Whalley , 2014 ; Montmartin and Herrera , 2015 ) and the effects on in - novation and economic indicators have also been evaluated ( Aguiar and Gagnepain , 2017 ; Szücs , 2018 ) . Another strand of the literature has investigated whether public research subsidies to private companies induce them to increase their private R & D efforts or whether they displace the companies’ private re - sources . The former case has been labelled the ’crowding out’ of private R & D through subsidies and the empirical literature has found some evidence for this ( Lach , 2002 ; Marino et al . , 2016 ; Wallsten , 2000 ) . The opposite case , subsidies increasing private R & D or enabling projects that would otherwise not have been undertaken , is consequently called the ’crowding in’ , or ’additionality’ of private efforts and has been documented as well ( Aerts and Schmidt , 2008 ; Czarnitzki and Licht , 2006 ; González et al . , 2005 ) . The basis for public subsidies to ﬁrms’ private innovation efforts is the presence of market imper - fections . Limited appropriability of innovation , uncertainty regarding the outcomes of a project and the indivisibility of resource - intensive research may cause private R & D to fall short of the socially optimal level . Public subsidies can thus be justiﬁed as offsetting this inefﬁciency . Thus , government subsidies have the goal of incentivizing research that is socially beneﬁcent , but might not have been privately proﬁtable for the ﬁrm . In an optimal setting , such a policy equates the marginal cost of research with its marginal social return and thus avoids inefﬁciency and increases innovation . Firms of course have an incentive to apply for subsidies whenever possible , even if the project in question could have been proﬁtably realized using private funding . In such a case , the subsidy is socially inefﬁcient and constitutes a transfer from the public to the ﬁrm . The choice of recipients for research subsidies is thus of considerable policy importance . For this reason , the previous literature has made efforts to identify areas in which subsidies effectively achieve additionality effects . First , some papers evaluating the impact of R & D subsidies have differentiated between effects on small and large ﬁrms , where these categories are usually deﬁned relative to the available sample . A recurring 2 ﬁnding is that subsidies are usually more effective when targeted towards smaller ﬁrms ( Bronzini and Piselli , 2016 ; González and Pazó , 2008 ) and that crowding out is higher for large ﬁrms ( Lach , 2002 ) . Conversely , Lööf and Broström ( 2008 ) ﬁnd that collaboration with universities creates knowledge spillovers for large manufacturing ﬁrms . Other research has focused on the size of the research subsidy or the subsidized project . While there is some evidence that small grants are particularly effective ( Görg and Strobl , 2007 ) and that larger sub - sidies may be susceptible to substituting private R & D ( Marino et al . , 2016 ) , other studies have found that innovation outcomes improve with larger subsidies ( Szücs , 2018 ) . The type of subsidy programme and the mechanism of resource allocation have been the subject of scrutiny as well . The effects of subsidies have been shown to depend on whether the subsidized projects are closer to a ’research’ or to a ’development’ stage ( Clausen , 2009 ) ; on whether funding is allocated competitively or rule - based ( Colombo et al . , 2011 ) ; and on the speciﬁc funding programme ( Benfratello and Sembenelli , 2002 ) . Another potential determinant of the success of research subsidies might lie in the tech - intensity of the subsidized ﬁrms and industries . While there is some evidence that crowding out is higher for ﬁrms with lower R & D intensities ( Marino et al . , 2016 ) , other studies have found evidence for crowding in and innovation effects in low - tech sectors ( González and Pazó , 2008 ; Maietta , 2015 ) This study aims to contribute to the body of literature cited above by investigating the crowding out hypothesis in an interesting dataset containing the world’s largest R & D performers and comprising more than 90 % of corporate R & D expenditures . Almost 500 of these ﬁrms ( with a combined research budget in excess of e 200 bn as of 2016 ) have participated in subsidized research projects under the FP6 , FP7 and H2020 programmes . We show that the decision to participate is non - random and that the subsidized ﬁrms differ signiﬁcantly from the average ﬁrm . However , the randomness of the participation decision is restored through a matching procedure . In the resulting balanced sample , we analyze the causal impact of three different treatments : project participation , the level of overall project funding and the speciﬁc sub - sidies received by a ﬁrm . Effects on the ﬁrms’ R & D efforts are estimated through difference - in - difference ( DiD ) estimation . We show that on average all three treatments have neither crowded out nor crowded in private R & D funding , such that all average treatment effects on the treated ( ATTs ) are insigniﬁcant . In a second step , we show that this average null - effect obscures interesting and policy - relevant heterogeneities . Differentiating small and large ﬁrms , we ﬁnd some evidence for crowding in effects for small ﬁrms . Similarly , when distinguishing large and small research grants , we ﬁnd that private funding is strongly increased by small grants , but not by large ones . Allowing for different effects on ﬁrms with low and high R & D intensity respectively , we ﬁnd that low R & D intensity ﬁrms experience some crowding out , while high R & D intensity ﬁrms further increase their research efforts . Furthermore , as our data comprises three distinct subsidy schemes ( FP6 , FP7 and H2020 ) , 3 we can discriminate between their individual effects . This reveals that while the ATTs of FP6 and FP7 remain insigniﬁcant , H2020 projects have stimulated participants to increase their private spending . The remainder of this article is organized as follows : Section 2 reviews the relevant literature on crowding out and EC subsidies . Section 3 describes the dataset , the matching procedure and the empirical model . Section 4 presents the ﬁndings of the analysis and section 5 concludes . 2 Literature 2 . 1 Private R & D efforts and public subsidies In a review of studies addressing the complementarity or substitutability of public and private research efforts , David et al . ( 2000 ) survey more than three decades of evidence . Unfortunately and owing to the multiplicity of approaches and levels of aggregation in the reviewed studies , the survey does not arrive at a deﬁnitive conclusion regarding the relationship of interest . They suggest that future studies should employ panel data , account for endogeneity and use quasi - experimental settings or policy experiments to identify effects and increase comparability . In a more recent review of the empirical literature on R & D subsidies and their relation with private R & D funding , Dimos and Pugh ( 2016 ) survey 52 studies . These studies are more comparable than those surveyed by David et al . and all of them account , to some degree , for selection issues . Still , they report a broad range of empirical ﬁndings . Motivated by this lack of conclusiveness of the individual ﬁndings , Dimos and Pugh conduct a meta - regression analysis on the studies . Although they can reject crowding - out of public funding , they ﬁnd no evidence of additionality effects . Thus , while individual empirical studies continue to ﬁnd different and often contrasting effects , the - at least partial - standardization of empirical approaches has made it possible to derive some generalizations . 1 Empirical studies can be classiﬁed as either ﬁnding evidence for crowding in effects , ﬁnding evidence for crowding out effects , or neither . The ﬁrst group includes a rather large number of studies ( Almus and Czarnitzki , 2003 ; Duguet , 2004 ; Aerts and Schmidt , 2008 ; ? ; Einiö , 2014 ; Hud and Hussinger , 2015 ; Bronzini and Piselli , 2016 ; ? ; González and Pazó , 2008 ; Hussinger , 2008 ; Guellec et al . , 2003 ; Czarnitzki and Licht , 2006 ) . Aerts and Schmidt ( 2008 ) use ﬁrm - level data from an innovation survey in Germany and the Belgian region of Flanders to test the impact of R & D subsidies on private spending . In both cases , they reject the crowding out hypothesis and ﬁnd that the R & D intensity of subsidized ﬁrms is by 64 - 100 % higher than that non - subsidized ﬁrms . Similarly , using data on public research grants in Eastern Germany , Almus and Czarnitzki ( 2003 ) use 1 A similar meta - analysis on the topic of R & D tax credits is conducted in Castellacci and Lie ( 2015 ) . They ﬁnd evidence for additionality , particularly in small - and medium - sized enterprises and in low - tech sectors . 4 non - parametric matching to investigate the performance of subsidized ﬁrms . They ﬁnd that subsidies do not crowd private efforts out , but that recipients increase their R & D intensity . The efﬁcacy of Finnish R & D subsidies is evaluated by Einiö ( 2014 ) . Exploiting a population - density rule in the allocation of subsidies , he ﬁnds that subsidized ﬁrms on average increase R & D investment , sales and employment and , after a 3 - year lag , also experience productivity gains . Bronzini and Piselli ( 2016 ) also employ a discontinuity - based approach by comparing barely - granted with barely - rejected subsidy applications in Italy . They ﬁnd that grant - receiving ﬁrms apply for more patents than non - receivers and that subsidies are particularly effective for smaller ﬁrms . Hud and Hussinger ( 2015 ) investigate small and medium sized companies in Germany in the period 2006 - 2010 . They ﬁnd that , on average , subsidies had a positive effects on ﬁrms’ R & D efforts and thus conclude in favour of additionality effects . They ﬁnd that the effect was negative ( i . e . crowding - out ) in 2009 , which they attribute to the ﬁnancial crisis . González and Pazó ( 2008 ) use a dataset of Spanish manufacturing ﬁrms and also look for hetero - geneities between large and small ﬁrms and high and low - tech sectors . They reject full or partial crowd - ing out and conclude that some ﬁrms , particularly small and low - tech ﬁrms , were incentivized to conduct R & D through the subsidies . The impact of public subsidies on private R & D per employee and on new product sales is evaluated in Hussinger ( 2008 ) . Using two - step estimators , she shows that the R & D intensity of subsidized ﬁrms increases and that subsidies are as productive as private R & D in generating new product sales . Guellec et al . ( 2003 ) evaluate the impact of R & D subsidies and tax credits across 17 OECD member states and two decades . They ﬁnd that both subsidies and tax credits individually have a positive effect on private R & D efforts by ﬁrms , but that the two are substitutes : increasing one diminishes the effect of the other . They also ﬁnd evidence for diminishing returns to public subsidies . Looking at the case of Eastern Germany , Czarnitzki and Licht ( 2006 ) consider the effect of research subsidies on private R & D expenditures . Accounting for selection , they ﬁnd positive treatment effects : subsidized ﬁrms increase both their R & D intensity and their innovation intensity . Subsidized ﬁrms are also more likely to apply for patents . Interestingly , many ﬁrms from Eastern Germany would not have innovated in absence of research subsidies and the authors conclude that R & D promotion has made a crucial contribution to R & D in Eastern Germany . Providing evidence for France , Duguet ( 2004 ) studies research subsidies from French ministries to ﬁrms in the 1985 - 1997 period . Controlling for selection , he ﬁnds no evidence for crowding out and concludes that subsidies increase the R & D efforts of ﬁrms . Studies ﬁnding evidence for the crowding out of private R & D through subsidies include Lach ( 2002 ) ; Marino et al . ( 2016 ) ; Wallsten ( 2000 ) . In a study on Israeli R & D subsidies , Lach ( 2002 ) focuses on the manufacturing sector in the 1990s . While the subsidies seem to have a strongly increased the R & D of small ﬁrms , the effect of subsidies on larger ﬁrms is found to be insigniﬁcantly negative . As most grants 5 go to larger ﬁrms , the overall effect is not signiﬁcantly different from zero and crowding out cannot be rejected . Marino et al . ( 2016 ) study a sample of French ﬁrms receiving R & D subsidies and tax credits in the 1993 - 2009 period . They ﬁnd that research subsidies and tax credits substitute private R & D spending . Distin - guishing large , medium and small subsidies , they report that crowding out is particularly pronounced for the recipients of medium and large subsidies . Wallsten ( 2000 ) focuses on a dataset of small US companies receiving federal research grants and emphasizes the role of endogeneity . He ﬁnds that public funding fully crowds out private funding of R & D and that it does not generate additional employment . Finally , a number of studies ( Clausen , 2009 ; Hottenrott et al . , 2017 ; González et al . , 2005 ; Görg and Strobl , 2007 ; Czarnitzki et al . , 2007 ; Gelabert et al . , 2009 ) report mixed ﬁndings with regard to the crowding out hypothesis . Clausen ( 2009 ) investigates whether public subsidies and private R & D spending are complements or substitutes using a sample of Norwegian ﬁrms . He ﬁnds that subsidies induce additional private spending when a project is ’far from the market’ ( i . e . research ) , but crowd - out private spending when projects are ’close to the market’ ( i . e . development ) . Similar ﬁndings are reported by Hottenrott et al . ( 2017 ) . Using Spanish ﬁrm - level data , González et al . ( 2005 ) ﬁnd no evidence for crowding - out of private funds through subsidies . Conversely , while they ﬁnd that some ﬁrms would cease their R & D activities without public funding , they also ﬁnd that most subsidies go to ﬁrms that would have performed R & D even without subsidies . In Görg and Strobl ( 2007 ) , Irish manufacturing ﬁrms receiving government R & D support are evaluated . Findings suggest that small grants to domestic ﬁrms can trigger R & D , while large grants may crowd it out . For foreign ﬁrms , the size of the grant does not seem to play a role . Focusing on Finland and Germany Czarnitzki et al . ( 2007 ) , estimate the impact of both subsidies and collaboration . While the authors ﬁnd that collaboration increases the R & D of German ﬁrms , there seems to be little evidence for the impact of subsidies on R & D or patenting . Conversely , in Finland both R & D subsidies and collaboration have a positive effect on R & D spending and patenting . Taking into account the degree to which an innovation can be appropriated by ﬁrms , Gelabert et al . ( 2009 ) investigate the question of additionality using a dataset of Spanish ﬁrms from 2000 - 2005 . They ﬁnd that in areas , where appropriation mechanisms are effective , public funding crowds out private efforts . Conversely , the effect of public funding is three times larger in a projects , where appropriability is low . In summary , the empirical evidence on crowding out remains rather diverse , but a few regularities emerge . First , while the evidence for additional private spending induced through subsidies remains sparse , most studies reject a full crowding out of private efforts . Thus , in most of the samples studied , ﬁrms engage in more R & D through subsidies . Second , most studies taking heterogeneities seriously and reporting results for e . g . different groups of ﬁrms or different industries , ﬁnd non - uniform effects . In 6 particular , when small and large ﬁrms are distinguished , many studies ﬁnd that subsidies are particularly effective for small ﬁrms . 2 . 2 Evidence on the EC’s research subsidies We now summarize ﬁve other studies analyzing the impact of the EC’s research subsidy programs on participating ﬁrms , Barajas et al . ( 2012 ) ; Benfratello and Sembenelli ( 2002 ) ; Bayona - Sáez and García - Marco ( 2010 ) ; Aguiar and Gagnepain ( 2017 ) and Szücs ( 2018 ) . Evaluating the effects of the Fifth , as well as parts of the Fourth and Sixth Framework Programmes on Spanish ﬁrms in the 1995 - 2005 period , Barajas et al . ( 2012 ) ﬁnd that participants substantially increase their intangible capital . This increase leads , in turn , to increased productivity . Benfratello and Sembenelli ( 2002 ) compare the effects of the EC’s earlier research subsidy programmes ( EUREKA , active from 1985 to 1996 ) with those of the early FPs 3 and 4 ( active from 1992 to 1996 ) . 411 participating companies , matched to AMADEUS data , form the basis of their evaluation . Their ﬁndings show that ﬁrms participating in EUREKA programs increase their labour productivity and price - cost margins . They ﬁnd no similar effects for the two FPs . The effects of EUREKA participation are also evaluated in Bayona - Sáez and García - Marco ( 2010 ) . Studying 284 participating ﬁrms in the 1994 - 2003 period , the authors ﬁnd that subsidy recipients ex - perience increased return on assets . They also distinguish manufacturing and non - manufacturing ﬁrms and ﬁnd that while the former reap higher beneﬁts , those for the latter group manifest more quickly . The Fifth FP is evaluated in Aguiar and Gagnepain ( 2017 ) . Focusing on market - oriented collaboration , they ﬁnd a large increase in participants’ labour productivity , while proﬁts are not affected . A more recent Framework Programme , FP7 , is evaluated in Szücs ( 2018 ) . Considering a range of patent - related innovation indicators , it is shown that an insigniﬁcant average effect of participation masks important heterogeneities . The effects on innovation are positive for larger projects and projects involving universities and increase with the academic quality of the participating universities . 3 Data and estimation 3 . 1 EU Industrial R & D Investment Scoreboard data The EU Industrial R & D Investment Scoreboard ( IRI ) , 2 compiled by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre , collects data on the largest corporate R & D investors , based on the companies’ annual 2 Available at http : / / iri . jrc . ec . europa . eu / scoreboard . html . 7 reports . It contains ﬁrms from many different countries and industries , 3 and has , over the years , increased in scope : while in its ﬁrst year , 2003 , data were collected for the 500 largest EU companies and the 500 largest non - EU companies , a total of at least 2 , 500 ﬁrms have been included since 2013 . 4 The largest R & D investors in the data are Volkswagen , Microsoft , Intel , Pﬁzer and Roche , having spent e 108bn , e 101bn , e 87bn e 86bn and e 85bn respectively , over the years . The ﬁrst six columns of table 1 contain summary statistics on the ﬁrms contained in IRI . The number of observations , displayed in the ﬁrst column , increases over time . The second columns reports yearly mean R & D spending by IRI companies , ranging from e 186m to e 297m . The R & D reported in IRI are the investments funded by the companies themselves and excludes contract R & D and joint ventures . It is thus net of subsidies received by the companies . All R & D expenditures were converted to 2016 Euros . No data on the location of R & D expenditures is collected and the R & D of subsidiaries is consolidated with that of the parent company . Thus , all R & D expenditures are allocated to the country of the parent companies’ registered ofﬁce . It should also be noted that mean R & D spending is likely inﬂuenced by the changes sample com - position ( the same applies to the sum of R & D spending ) . In the years from 2013 to 2017 , in which the sample size remained mostly constant , average spending increased from e 189m to e 254m , or by 34 % . The remaining columns report the sum of R & D spending , the standard deviation , the minimum and the maximum . For 2016 and 2017 , the sum of included R & D expenses is about e 743bn , corresponding to 90 % of global , corporate R & D ( EU R & D Scoreboard , 2017 , 2018 ) . R & D expenses are also quite concentrated among a few companies : the share of the 30 largest companies in the total R & D expenses contained in the data varies between 30 and 37 % over the years . The share of European companies in total R & D has remained relatively constant and around 26 % , with the R & D expenditures of US companies slightly in - creasing to 40 % . The share of Japan has declined from 24 % to around 16 % , while that of China and of the rest of the world has increased ( EU R & D Scoreboard , 2017 ) . The accumulated R & D spending by the 5 , 737 included companies over the years amounts to e 7 . 4 trillion . Due to the construction of the IRI dataset ( recording the largest companies in each year ) , many companies enter or drop out from the panel each year . By focusing on companies for which at least three years of data are available , we reduce the number of included ﬁrms to 3 , 841 , while retaining more than 97 % of total R & D expenditures . The remaining six columns of table 1 contain information on IRI companies , that received research subsidies from the EC . As can be seen from their mean R & D expenditures , these ﬁrms are substantially 3 Firms in the IRI data are headquartered in 55 different countries with the US ( 31 % ) , Japan ( 14 % ) , the UK ( 10 % ) , Germany ( 8 % ) and China ( 5 % ) most prominently represented . Firms are assigned to about 30 sectors , the largest of which are pharmaceuticals ( 13 % ) , industrial ( 11 % ) , software ( 9 % ) , electrical ( 9 % ) and automobiles ( 6 % ) . 4 IRI typically contains the top - 2 , 000 or top 2 , 500 worldwide R & D ﬁrms , along with the top - 1 , 000 for Europe . As there is a varying degree of overlap between these lists , sample sizes change across years . 8 Table 1 : R & D expenditures of ﬁrms in EU Industrial R & D Investment Scoreboard All IRI ﬁrms Firms matched to EU projects N Mean Sum SD Min Max N Mean Sum SD Min Max 2003 994 297 295050 700 . 2 9 5946 89 404 35947 752 . 5 9 3714 2004 1391 226 313941 617 . 2 5 5658 185 371 68633 811 . 9 5 4550 2005 1987 186 369192 586 . 4 3 6782 245 372 91043 927 . 2 3 5582 2006 1984 187 370195 574 . 1 3 5763 288 330 95181 875 . 3 3 5403 2007 1987 190 377672 578 . 8 4 5584 306 349 106731 920 . 1 4 5584 2008 1987 216 428933 640 . 2 4 7610 329 351 115555 957 . 1 4 7610 2009 1990 205 407427 599 . 5 4 6768 335 326 109179 878 . 1 4 6768 2010 1990 232 461440 676 . 9 5 7181 334 394 131432 1039 . 1 5 6741 2011 2077 249 516592 733 . 4 5 7754 320 454 145286 1205 . 1 5 7754 2012 2458 220 541078 695 . 7 5 9515 329 470 154644 1283 . 3 5 9515 2013 2847 189 538434 653 . 4 5 11743 314 502 157532 1388 . 8 6 11743 2014 2875 211 607765 744 . 2 5 13120 293 482 141263 1336 . 9 5 13120 2015 2893 241 697083 845 . 2 6 13612 308 633 195106 1768 . 6 7 13612 2016 2918 255 743281 898 . 0 7 13672 299 713 213311 1945 . 9 7 13672 2017 2919 254 742445 896 . 4 8 13437 281 693 194611 1848 . 4 8 13135 Total 33297 223 7410528 722 . 1 3 13672 4255 460 1955452 1284 . 5 3 13672 Notes : All monetary values are in million e . 9 Figure 1 : R & D spending and growth of EU funding recipients and non - recipients larger than the average ﬁrm contained in IRI , raising issues of selection . The sum of R & D spending by ﬁrms matched to EU projects amounts to e 195bn in 2017 and accumulates to almost e 2 trillion over the sample period . Thus , their R & D expenditures amount to almost a quarter of worldwide , corporate R & D . Figure 1 plots average R & D spending ( panel ( a ) ) and growth ( panel ( b ) ) over time and distinguishes EU funding recipients from non - recipients . While both types of ﬁrms experience similar dynamics in their R & D spending , we again see that funding recipients are larger than non - recipients . In panel ( b ) , we see that the R & D growth of non - recipients is both higher on average and more volatile . 3 . 2 CORDIS data on FP6 , FP7 and H2020 research projects To evaluate the impact of research subsidies on R & D spending , we link the companies in the IRI database to data on EU - funded research projects collected in the CORDIS database . 5 More speciﬁcally , we com - bine three CORDIS datasets , containing information on projects subsidized under the Sixth Framework Programme ( FP6 ) , the Seventh Framework Programme and the Horizon 2020 Programme . From CORDIS , we obtain data on the identity of companies participating in subsidized projects , as well as project - speciﬁc information such as the start and end date , the total cost and the EC’s contribution . Since 5 Available at http : / / data . europa . eu / euodp / en / data . 10 we are looking to match these data with the IRI data on ﬁrm - level R & D expenditures , we remove names that indicate academic institutions , research organizations and government institutions . From the list of all corporations involved in FP6 , FP7 or H2020 projects we retain those that are labelled " participants " by the EC ( 79 % ) . 6 We drop some projects that were eventually terminated or cancelled . The database thus compiled contains information on 23 , 547 projects ( 6 , 162 FP6 projects , 11 , 308 FP7 projects and 6 , 077 H2020 projects ) subsidized by the EC and on 48 , 679 companies participating in them . We link the names of these ﬁrms to the names of the ﬁrms in the IRI database . Since both databases also record a companies’ country of origin , we also require the countries to coincide in order to record a match . The matching algorithm proceeds in three stages : ﬁrst , we run exact string matching between the name in the CORDIS database and the name recorded in IRI . Next , we run exact matching based on substrings obtained by incrementally simplifying all names . This is achieved by removing confounding strings such as " PLC " , " LTD " , " GmbH " and many more . Finally , the remaining names are matched using a fuzzy matching procedure , which assigns a probability score to pairs of CORDIS and IRI names . The resulting matches were evaluated manually . This procedure results in 580 IRI companies being linked to a total of 3 , 210 projects recorded in CORDIS . Since some of the projects started either before or after the sample period or do not overlap with the available ﬁrm - level data , we are left with 2 , 945 matched projects in the 2003 - 2016 period . For these projects , we record i ) the total amount of subsidies paid by the EC at the project level ( available for all three programmes ) and ii ) the speciﬁc subsidy paid out to the matched IRI ﬁrm ( available only for FP7 and H2020 ) . Thus , while all three programmes are included for evaluation , the evaluation of ﬁrm - level subsidies can only be performed for FP7 and H2020 . Since the timing of payments for both the project - and the ﬁrm - speciﬁc subsidy amounts are not further speciﬁed in the data , we allocate all funding evenly distributed across the entire duration of a project . Table 2 contains summary statistics on the projects in the data . While few projects are active at the beginning of the sample period , their number quickly increases and from 2007 to 2017 we observe more than 700 active projects per year . The average subsidies paid out per project vary between e 1 . 5 and 2 . 1m over the years , the total amount exceeds e 1bn annually after 2005 . Total project - level subsidies amount to more than e 17bn . Firm - level subsidies are not observed in the 2003 - 2007 period ( when only FP6 projects are active ) and then amount to an average of e 67 , 000 to 149 , 000 per ﬁrm and year . The subsidies paid to ﬁrms under FP7 and H2020 projects in the data amount to a total of e 646m . 6 The remaining roles are " coordinators " ( 16 % ) and " host institutions " ( 4 % ) , which fulﬁl mostly administrative or logistic functions . Almost all of these are either research centres or universities and are thus eliminated through the focus on companies . 11 Table 2 : Summary statistics of FP6 / FP7 / H2020 projects matched Project level Firm level Projects Average Total Average Total active Subsidy Subsidy Subsidy Subsidy 2003 20 1 . 657 28 0 . 000 0 2004 236 2 . 125 474 0 . 000 0 2005 412 1 . 877 742 0 . 000 0 2006 694 1 . 725 1166 0 . 000 0 2007 723 1 . 669 1176 0 . 000 0 2008 841 1 . 646 1357 0 . 067 3 2009 815 1 . 608 1285 0 . 076 18 2010 859 1 . 557 1314 0 . 083 31 2011 860 1 . 553 1314 0 . 088 48 2012 914 1 . 519 1367 0 . 087 60 2013 926 1 . 596 1457 0 . 084 64 2014 778 1 . 688 1291 0 . 087 59 2015 826 1 . 860 1512 0 . 124 99 2016 796 2 . 012 1576 0 . 140 123 2017 798 2 . 092 1644 0 . 149 141 Total 2945 1 . 721 17702 0 . 108 646 Notes : All monetary values are in million e . 12 3 . 3 Propensity score matching and sample balance As demonstrated in table 1 and ﬁgure 1 , ﬁrms that participated in subsidized research projects appear to be non - randomly selected : they have substantially larger levels of R & D ( mean expenditures of e 460m versus e 223m on average across all ﬁrms ) and lower volatility of R & D expenditures than non - participating ﬁrms . Therefore , it is important to take selection into treatment seriously ( Imbens and Wooldridge , 2009 ) . If treated and untreated ﬁrms differ systematically , a straight up comparison may not be valid : any difference in performance attributed to the treatment might also be caused by one of the other disparities between groups . Put differently , if receiving or not receiving treatment is not the only difference between groups , we cannot determine which difference was the cause of the effects we are interested in . Further , we are confronted with a ’missing counterfactual’ problem , since we only observe either treated outcomes ( i . e . the R & D spending of ﬁrms that received subsidies ) or non - treated outcomes ( i . e . the R & D spending of ﬁrms that did not receive subsidies ) . A widespread approach to address these issues is to construct a control group using matching and to estimate the causal impact of treatment using difference - in - difference ( DiD ) estimation . The matching pro - cedure consists of two steps : ﬁrst , we calculate the likelihood of treatment ( the propensity score ) for both treated and non - treated ﬁrms , based on observable characteristics . This measure is then used by a match - ing algorithm to select the control group . By matching treated observations to control observations based on the similarity of their propensity scores , one obtains two groups that do not differ systematically with respect to the characteristics that the propensity score was based on ( Rosenbaum and Rubin , 1983 ) . This approach therefore controls for the observable heterogeneity between treated and control observations . 7 Thus , for every ﬁrm that received a research subsidy , we identify a ﬁrm with a similar likelihood of receiving a subsidy that was not subsidized during the observation period . If the algorithm successfully balances treated and non - treated ﬁrms , it solves both problems described above : since both subsidized and non - subsidized ﬁrms have the same ex - ante probability of receiving a subsidy in a balanced sample , the assignment to treatment is essentially random . Further , since the expected outcomes of non - treated 7 To successfully implement the propensity score approach , two conditions must be satisﬁed . First , the conditional independence assumption , stating that selection into treatment is based on observed characteristics , needs to hold . This means that assignment into treatment needs to be independent of the outcomes , conditional on observable characteristics . This assumption cannot be empirically tested ; essentially , we have to be conﬁdent that our selection model captures all important determinants driving the process of selection into treatment . While this is a strong assumption , it is very widespread in the evaluation of R & D subsidies . For example , more than half of the 52 studies surveyed by Dimos and Pugh ( 2016 ) use propensity score matching and thus assume conditional independence of assignment to treatment . Second , treated and non - treated units must have a common support , that is , they must have a sufﬁciently large overlap in their likelihood of receiving treatment . This condition can not only be tested , but also imposed by dropping certain treated units . In our case , we ﬁnd that after estimating the selection model three treated units have a propensity score higher than the maximum among potential controls . These three treatments are dropped from the analysis . For a more thorough discussion , see Rosenbaum and Rubin ( 1983 ) and Caliendo and Kopeinig ( 2008 ) . 13 ﬁrms differ from treated ﬁrms only by treatment , they can be used as the counterfactual observations required for treatment analysis . We estimate a probit model relating treatment status to R & D spending and growth , sales and proﬁts as well as country , industry and year ﬁxed - effects . The dependent variable is a treatment indicator set to one , if a ﬁrms starts receiving EC funds in the focal year . The 2 , 945 projects in the data lead to 518 treatments , i . e . periods , in which a ﬁrm starts to receive EC funding . Results are reported in table 3 .

Model in - cludes ﬁxed - effects for years ( 15 ) , countries ( 30 ) and industries ( 22 ) . The model conﬁrms that observable characteristics do indeed affect selection into treatment : while a high R & D growth reduces the probability of project participation , the level of R & D spending increases it . The sales and proﬁt rate of a ﬁrm ( deﬁned as proﬁts over sales ) do not affect the probability of treatment . The ( unreported ) ﬁxed - effects have the expected signs and show that participation is less likely for non - European ﬁrms and for certain industries , such as the media and ﬁnancial industry . The year ﬁxed - effects also play a signiﬁcant role , reﬂecting that many projects an the data start early in the sampling period . A pseudo - R 2 of 22 % indicates that the model is able to explain a reasonable amount of variation in the dependent variable . Based on the estimated model coefﬁcients , we predict the propensity score , the ex - ante probability of receiving EC funds . We use a 1 : 1 nearest - neighbour matching algorithm ( Caliendo and Kopeinig , 2008 ) . Each treated ﬁrm is matched to that non - treated ﬁrm which has the most similar probability of treatment . The pool of potential matches is constrained to the same year , industry and country as the treated ﬁrm . We thus ensure that each control observation refers to the same time period ( to control for time - speciﬁc effects ) , belongs to the same industry ( to control for industry - speciﬁc shocks ) and is headquartered in the same country ( to control for country - speciﬁc effects ) as the respective treated observation . In some cases , when under these strict criteria no match is found , we relax the country - constraint ( i . e . allow the control observation to originate from another country ) , but retain the time - and industry - constraints . If still no 14 suitable match can be found we discard the observation . This matching procedure results in a sample of 489 treated - control ﬁrms - pairs . This constitutes the estimation sample . The 489 treatment - control pairs are observed for up to 15 years of time in the 2003 - 2017 period . The panel is unbalanced due to data limitations , but ﬁrms are observed for more than 8 years on average . The estimation sample comprises 7 , 615 observations . While the sample is not overly large , it does comprise the world’s largest corporate R & D investors . Of the 978 ﬁrms in the data , 803 report total R & D expenditures in excess of e 100m , with two of them ( Volkswagen and Microsoft ) spending more than e 100bn over the years . The total R & D expenditures of ﬁrms in the sample amount to more than e 3 . 5 trillion , corresponding to almost half of worldwide , corporate R & D in the 2003 - 2017 period . The included ﬁrms are active in 22 industries ( the most prominent being pharmaceuticals ( 15 % ) , indus - trial ( 13 % ) and chemicals ( 8 % ) ) and 42 different countries ( 17 % of ﬁrms are from Germany , 16 % from the US and 14 % from the UK ) . Table 4 provides summary statistics for the dataset before and after matching .

To assess whether the matching procedure was successful in levelling the differences between treated and non - treated ﬁrms , we test for statistically signiﬁcant differences between the two groups . Before matching , the propensity score , logs of R & D and sales and the proﬁt rate is higher for treated than for control ﬁrms , while their R & D growth is lower . All differences are statistically signiﬁcant with most p - values close to zero ( colums 1 - 3 of table 4 ) . Re - running the t - tests after matching ( colums 4 - 6 of table 4 ) , we ﬁnd that the initial differences in means have been successfully levelled and that the matching covariates are no longer signiﬁcantly different across treatment and control groups . Figure 2 illustrates the initial level and reduction of the standardized biases in the matching covariates . Rubin ( 2001 ) proposes that the standardized bias ( deﬁned as ¯ X 1 − ¯ X 0 1 2 ( σ 1 + σ 0 ) , that is the difference in means of treated and control groups divided by the mean of their standard deviations ) of covariates should be below 0 . 25 after matching . This condition is generously met in our sample . 15 Figure 2 : Standardized biases before and after matching Three additional checks to test for covariate balance are proposed by Rubin ( 2001 ) . First , the mean propensity scores of treated and control group should not differ by more than half their standard deviation . Second , the ratio of the variances of the propensity scores should be close to one ( i . e . between 0 . 5 and 2 ) . Third , the ratio of the residuals after regressing covariates on propensity scores should be close to one . All three criteria are met in the matched sample : the difference in propensity score between the two groups is 0 . 0095 and thus much lower than half the standard deviation of 0 . 092 . The ratio of the variances of the propensity scores is 1 . 30 . Thus , the variance is higher for the treated group , but the ratio remains well within the bounds deﬁned by Rubin ( 2001 ) . Similarly , the ratio of residual variances for the four covariates ( log R & D and sales , R & D growth and the proﬁt rate ) all lie between 0 . 96 and 1 . 22 . Thus , all three additional balancing checks indicate that that the matching procedure succeeded in purging the observable heterogeneity between treatment and control groups . Figure 3 plots the evolution of mean R & D spending across the two groups . Before matching occurs in period t = 0 , the R & D spending of both subsidized ﬁrms and the control group declines . As both R & D trajectories evolve in a very similar fashion , there is evidence for a common trend prior to the matching period . The existence of a common trend - the so - called ’common trend assumption’ - is central to the validity of inference in a DiD setting . A more formal test of this assumption is described in footnote 8 . After matching , the evolution of the treatment group is remarkably similar to that of the control group : in the years after the start of the research subsidies , the R & D expenditures of treated and control ﬁrms evolve in a roughly parallel fashion , with no strong deviations from the growth trend . However , as the 16 Figure 3 : Evolution of R & D spending of subsidized ﬁrms and control group ﬁrms in the data are - by construction of the dataset - the largest R & D performers in the world , the subsidies received are small relative to their own R & D expenditures . The ﬁrm - speciﬁc subsidies received under FP7 and H2020 on average amount to just 0 . 3 % of total , ﬁrm - level R & D costs . The total cost of EU - subsidized projects ( FP6 , FP7 and H2020 ) the ﬁrms in the data are involved in amounts to an average of 18 % of their own R & D spending . Thus , the potential impact of the subsidies could be relatively small and need not be apparent from visual inspection of the data , but might be picked up in a regression analysis . 3 . 4 Estimation After having constructed the treatment and control groups , we proceed to estimate the effects of research subsidies on own R & D in a DiD setting . The average treatment effect on the treated ( ATT ) is estimated as the difference between both the before and after periods and the treatment and control groups . Formally , we estimate log ( R & D ) i , t = α + treated i + post t + ( treated i × post t ) × ξ i , t + X it + ε i , t ( 1 ) where log ( R & D ) i , t designates the log of ﬁrm i ’s R & D expenditures at time t , treated i indicates the treatment group ( ﬁrms that received subsidies ) and post t indicates the evaluation period , i . e . the period in which subsidies were received . In the regression output , coefﬁcients for treated i and post t are not reported , as their impact will be captured by ﬁrm ﬁxed - effects and time - ﬁxed effects respectively . Thus , while their impact is accounted for , they will not be separately estimated due to collinearity . Their product , treated i × post t , is the ATT . The interaction term ξ i , t is either equal to one ( when we 17 estimate the ATT ) , or equals a measure of treatment intensity , such as the total amount of project funding or subsidies received . Further , ξ i , t can be used to split sample and estimate effects in a speciﬁc sub - sample . For example , by letting ξ i , t indicate sub - samples of different ﬁrm sizes , R & D intensities or subsidy programmes , we can estimate the effects of subsidies in these speciﬁc sub - samples . 8 We subsume control variables in the matrix X it . Depending on the speciﬁcation , it includes ﬁxed - effects for 15 time periods and 978 ﬁrms or additionally includes ﬁxed - effects for 280 industry / country pairs . ε i , t is an error term that is robust to heteroskedasticity and allows for clustering on the ﬁrm - level . We estimate equation 1 for three distinct kinds of treatment : a binary variable , indicating participation in a project that was subsidized by the EC ; a variable containing the amount of project - level EC subsidies ( if a ﬁrm simultaneously participates in more than one subsidized project , subsidies are summed up ) ; and a variable containing the EC subsidies directly paid to the focal ﬁrm ( again , in case of multiple projects , subsidies are summed up ) . All three treatments are evaluated in two speciﬁcations : ﬁrst , we let X it contain ﬁrm and year ﬁxed - effects ; second , we add industry / country ﬁxed - effects . Thus , the regression tables presented below contain ( 3 treatments × 2 speciﬁcations = ) 6 models . 4 Results The results of estimating equation 1 in the sample are presented in table 5 . All estimated ATT coefﬁcients are positive : participating in a subsidized project increases R & D expenditures by 1 . 7 - 3 % and the elasticities of own R & D with respect to project - and ﬁrm - level funding received are around 4 and 7 % respectively . However , none of the reported coefﬁcients are statistically signiﬁcant and the null hypothesis of no effect cannot be rejected . Thus there either is no effect of research subsidies on own R & D ( i . e . no crowding out but also no additionality ) , or their effect is obscured through heterogeneities in the data . 9 This is investigated in the following tables . In table 6 , we set ξ i , t from equation 1 equal to an indicator , that splits subsidy recipients into two equally - sized groups , based on their median sales . We thus repeat the exercise from the previous table , 8 We also use this estimation setting to provide an extra check on the common trend assumption . To this end , we let ξ i , t denote pre - treatment periods and check for period - speciﬁc effects on the treated group in t < 0 . The logic of this test is similar to a placebo check . We check for differences in the pre - treatment evolution of treated and control groups in up to 14 years prior to treatment and ﬁnd no signiﬁcant differences between groups , indicating that the common trend assumption holds . Similarly , using a t - test to test for systematic differences in pre - treatment periods fails to reject the null hypothesis of no effect . This corroborates the visual evidence on a common trend provided in ﬁgure 3 . 9 The lack of signiﬁcance is partially owed to the fact that the regression standard errors are allowed to cluster at the level of the ﬁrm , increasing them substantially . Using only heteroskedasticity - robust errors ( without clustering them ) results in the ATTs for project funding and ﬁrm funding in table 5 becoming signiﬁcant ( the coefﬁcients remain unchanged ) . Similarly , the signiﬁcance of some results in the following tables also increases with non - clustered standard errors . Yet , ﬁrms might be subject to unit - speciﬁc shocks , inducing correlation of their standard errors . Recognizing this , we prefer to report the more conservative estimates allowing for this possibility . 18 Table 5 : Effects of participation , project - and ﬁrm - level funding on R & D Participation Project funding Firm funding ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) Treated * Post 0 . 017 0 . 030 ( 0 . 035 ) ( 0 . 034 ) log ( Project Subsidy ) 0 . 038 0 . 037 ( 0 . 028 ) ( 0 . 028 ) log ( Firm Subsidy ) 0 . 074 0 . 074 ( 0 . 077 ) ( 0 . 078 ) R2 0 . 958 0 . 961 0 . 958 0 . 961 0 . 958 0 . 961 N 7615 7615 7615 7615 7615 7615 Firm FE (cid:88) (cid:88) (cid:88) (cid:88) (cid:88) (cid:88) Period FE (cid:88) (cid:88) (cid:88) (cid:88) (cid:88) (cid:88) Industry × Country FE (cid:88) (cid:88) (cid:88) Notes : Robust standard errors ( in parentheses ) allow for clustering at the ﬁrm - level , ∗ p < 0 . 1 , ∗∗ p < 0 . 05 , ∗∗∗ p < 0 . 01 . but distinguish effects on above - and below - median sized ﬁrms . Note , however , that due to the nature of our dataset both groups of ﬁrms are relatively large , with the below - median group achieving average yearly sales of around e 800 m and the above median group exceeding e 12 bn in average yearly sales . The effects of participation and project funding are close to zero and insigniﬁcant for small ﬁrms . For large ﬁrms , the coefﬁcients indicate R & D increases of 3 to 6 % , but remain insigniﬁcant . When looking at the subsidies received directly by the ﬁrms , we observe no signiﬁcant effect for large ﬁrms , but see that they crowd in additional R & D from small ﬁrms : the elasticity of own R & D with respect to ﬁrm subsidies is estimated at 0 . 2 for small ﬁrms . Yet , this ﬁnding is only signiﬁcant at the 10 % level .

Similarly to distinguishing small and large ﬁrms , we are able to distinguish small and large funded 19 research projects . The CORDIS database contains information on the total cost of subsidized projects ( which is highly correlated with the total subsidy received at ρ = 0 . 99 ) , allowing us to split the sample at the median of project size . While the average project in the data costs approximately e 7 m in total , the averages below and above the median are e 290 , 000 and e 15 . 4 m respectively . Table 7 contains the regression results . Independently of project size , the treatment effects of partici - pation and project funding again remain insigniﬁcant . Differences become apparent when evaluating the effects of ﬁrm - level funding : while the coefﬁcient for large projects is comparable to the overall effect from table 5 and not signiﬁcant , the coefﬁcient for small projects is large and signiﬁcant . The coefﬁcient in column ( 6 ) suggests that public and private R & D are complements and that a subsidy of e 1 triggers an additional 61 cents of private spending .

In a next step , we implement the same median split based on ﬁrms’ R & D intensities . We thus calculate ﬁrms R & D intensities as the ratio of their R & D expenditures to their total sales and split the sample at the median value of 4 . 8 % , resulting in median R & D intensities of 3 . 1 % and 13 . 1 % for the two subsamples above and below the median . The results are presented in table 8 . Here , we see a clear difference between the two subsamples : for ﬁrms with low R & D intensity , project participation crowds out 9 - 10 % of own efforts , while the effects of project - and ﬁrm - level funding are insigniﬁcantly negative . Conversely , for ﬁrms with high R & D intensities , all treatment effects are positive and signiﬁcant . Project participation increases own R & D by 13 - 14 % , while the elasticities of own R & D with respect to research subsidies are 8 % and the project funding level and 15 % at the ﬁrm funding level . Finally , we differentiate the impact of the three distinct subsidy programmes contained in the data : FP6 , FP7 and H2020 . Of the 2 , 945 matched projects in the data ( see section 3 . 2 ) , 814 were commissioned under FP6 , 1 , 457 under FP7 and 674 under H2020 . If a ﬁrm is involved in more than one project , we calculate the shares of the three programmes accordingly . Note that for FP6 , ﬁrm - level subsidies are not 20 Table 8 : Effects on R & D by R & D intensity Participation Project funding Firm funding ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) Low R & D Intensity − 0 . 102 ∗∗∗ − 0 . 091 ∗∗ − 0 . 004 − 0 . 006 − 0 . 040 − 0 . 038 ( 0 . 038 ) ( 0 . 038 ) ( 0 . 028 ) ( 0 . 028 ) ( 0 . 116 ) ( 0 . 118 ) High R & D Intensity 0 . 128 ∗∗∗ 0 . 143 ∗∗∗ 0 . 077 ∗∗ 0 . 077 ∗∗ 0 . 146 ∗ 0 . 146 ∗ ( 0 . 041 ) ( 0 . 040 ) ( 0 . 032 ) ( 0 . 033 ) ( 0 . 083 ) ( 0 . 085 ) R2 0 . 958 0 . 962 0 . 958 0 . 961 0 . 958 0 . 961 N 7615 7615 7615 7615 7615 7615 Firm FE (cid:88) (cid:88) (cid:88) (cid:88) (cid:88) (cid:88) Period FE (cid:88) (cid:88) (cid:88) (cid:88) (cid:88) (cid:88) Industry × Country FE (cid:88) (cid:88) (cid:88) Notes : Robust standard errors ( in parentheses ) allow for clustering at the ﬁrm - level , ∗ p < 0 . 1 , ∗∗ p < 0 . 05 , ∗∗∗ p < 0 . 01 . observed and thus only the impact of participation and project level funding can be estimated . Table 9 contains the results , when the ATT is allowed to vary by programme . The results show , that the ﬁndings for FP6 and FP7 do not differ from those obtained in the full sample ( table 5 ) : on average , the treatments do not exert a signiﬁcant effect on the R & D of participants . H2020 projects , on the other hand , seem to perform signiﬁcantly better in terms of stimulating private R & D efforts . Participation increases private R & D by 11 - 12 % and the crowd in elasticities are 7 % for project funding and 17 % for ﬁrm - level funding .

The economic rationale is that , without such subsidies , private ef - forts would fall short of the social optimum . A considerable literature is devoted to the question whether these subsidies actually improve innovation outcomes , or merely replace - or crowd out - private efforts . This article contributes to that literature by providing new evidence from a novel and interesting dataset and by speciﬁcally addressing a number of questions that are still left open in the discussion . We combine a dataset containing the world’s largest research companies ( comprising 90 % of global corporate R & D , about 50 % of which ends up in the matched evaluation sample ) with a dataset containing three of the largest research subsidy programmes , the Sixth and Seventh Framework Programmes , as well as Horizon 2020 , all ﬁnanced by the EC . We identify almost 500 companies that participated in subsidized research projects and match them to a control group , such that each ﬁrm is assigned a non - participant from the same country , industry and year . The resulting sample of treated / non - treated pairs is balanced , i . e . there are no signiﬁcant differences left between the groups . We proceed to estimate the effect of research subsidies in a DiD framework , deﬁning three different kinds of treatment : the ( binary ) participation decision , the size of the project as measured by total subsidy and the total amount of funding received by a subsidized ﬁrm . We ﬁnd that the average effect of all three treatments is not signiﬁcantly different from zero . Exploring heterogeneities , we differentiate small and large ﬁrms in the data and ﬁnd , that small ﬁrms complement the subsidies received with private resources , such that a crowding in effect is achieved . Similarly , the smaller projects ( in terms of total cost ) in the data are more successful in stimulating private efforts than the larger ones . We further distinguish ﬁrms in terms of their R & D intensity . We ﬁnd that ﬁrms with a high R & D intensity signiﬁcantly increase their own R & D when participating in subsidized projects . Firms with a low R & D intensity , on the other hand , decrease theirs . Finally , we directly compare the treatment effects of the three different programmes . While we ﬁnd no signiﬁcant average effects for FP6 and FP7 , participation in Horizon 2020 projects seems to have encouraged ﬁrms to increase their own efforts as well . The ﬁndings of this study therefore suggest , that public money is best used to support the R & D of small and R & D intensive ﬁrms , working on ( relatively ) small projects , as such investments are most likely to trigger a substantial amount of private effort . From a policy perspective it is also encouraging , that while previous programmes did not ( on average ) result in the crowding in of additional private R & D , the most recent ( and still active ) subsidy programme has achieved this . 22 References Aerts , Kris and Tobias Schmidt , “Two for the price of one ? : Additionality effects of R & D subsidies : A comparison between Flanders and Germany , ” Research Policy , 2008 , 37 ( 5 ) , 806 – 822 .
