KEYWORDS AMPA receptor , Src family protein tyrosine kinase , palmitoylation , tyrosine phosphorylation , membrane , lipid rafts Introduction Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system ( CNS ) . Glutamate receptors ( GluRs ) majorly mediate fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain ( Seeburg , 1993 ; Hollmann and Heinemann , 1994 ; Mori and Mishina , 2003 ) . Excitatory synaptic strength is largely controlled by dynamic changes of α - amino - 3 - hydroxy - 5 - methyl - 4 - isoxazole propionate ( AMPA ) - type GluRs ( AMPA receptors ) expression on the synaptic surface , especially by a balance between rapid insertion of intracellular AMPA receptors into the surface and internalization of surface - expressing AMPA receptors in a stimulation - dependent manner ( Collingridge et al . , 2004 ; Kessels and Malinow , 2009 ; Huganir and Nicoll , 2013 ) . AMPA receptors are composed of four subunits , GluA1 – 4 ( also known as GluR1 – 4 , GluRA – D , or GluR α 1 – 4 ) . Major functional AMPA receptors in the adult Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience 01 frontiersin . org fnsyn - 14 - 921772 October 27 , 2022 Time : 12 : 13 # 2 Hayashi 10 . 3389 / fnsyn . 2022 . 921772 CNS comprise GluA1 / GluA2 - and GluA2 / GluA3 - containing receptors ( Shepherd and Huganir , 2007 ; Heine et al . , 2008 ; Henley and Wilkinson , 2016 ; Diering and Huganir , 2018 ) . The GluA2 subunit is the primary determinant during endocytosis from synapses and post - endocytic endosomal sorting ( Anggono and Huganir , 2012 ; Diering and Huganir , 2018 ) . Previous studies have revealed that traﬃcking processes of AMPA receptors are regulated by several post - translational protein modiﬁcations of the AMPA receptor subunits , including reversible phosphorylation , and S - palmitoylation of them ( Jiang et al . , 2006 ; Anggono and Huganir , 2012 ; Lu and Roche , 2012 ; Parkinson and Hanley , 2018 ) . Among those dynamic modiﬁcations , tyrosine phosphorylation of the GluA2 subunit enhances AMPA receptors internalization from the synaptic surface ( Hayashi and Huganir , 2004 ; Gladding et al . , 2009 ; Hu et al . , 2010 ; Yong et al . , 2020 ) . We have shown that Src family protein tyrosine kinases ( PTKs ) catalyze tyrosine phosphorylation of GluA2 at tyrosine 876 ( Hayashi and Huganir , 2004 ) . GluA2 tyrosine phosphorylation induces an exchange of GluA2 - binding scaﬀolding proteins from glutamate receptor - interacting proteins 1 / 2 ( GRIP1 / 2 ) to protein interacting with C - kinase ( PICK1 ) , which sequentially drives endocytosis of surface AMPA receptors ( Hayashi and Huganir , 2004 ; Yong et al . , 2020 ) . Furthermore , the interaction of GluA2 with the synaptic protein BRAG2 , a guanine - nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) for the coat - recruitment GTPase Arf6 , occurs in a GluA2 tyrosine phosphorylation - dependent manner , which induces the AMPA receptor endocytosis in long - term synaptic depression ( Scholz et al . , 2010 ) . Src family PTKs are palmitoylated and myristoylated at their N - terminal regions ( Neet and Hunter , 1996 ) . Covalent attachments of saturated fatty acids , 16 - carbon containing palmitate and 14 - carbon containing myristate , on the non - receptor type PTKs generally increase their aﬃnity to membrane fraction and induce their translocation from cytosolic region to membrane ( Nadolski and Linder , 2007 ; Resh , 2016 ) . Furthermore , accumulating evidence indicates that these protein lipidations enable signaling molecules to limitedly localize in a speciﬁc lipid microdomain in the cellular membrane , termed lipid rafts ( Simons and Vaz , 2004 ; Turner et al . , 2005 ; Pike , 2006 ) . Lipid rafts are primarily sphingolipids and cholesterol - enriched dynamic membrane microdomains , which have been proposed as a center for the interaction or assembly of palmitoylated signaling molecules , including Src family PTKs , G - proteins , and various membrane receptors ( Kasahara et al . , 2000 ; Moﬀett et al . , 2000 ; Foster et al . , 2003 ; Fujita et al . , 2007 ) . The brain is the organ with the highest enrichment in lipids , including sphingolipids and cholesterol ( Aureli et al . , 2015 ; Schnaar , 2016 ) . Lipid rafts abundantly exist in the dendrites of neurons and function in the maintenance of synapses as well as in the stabilization of surface AMPA receptors ( Hering et al . , 2003 ) . Here , I present that the lipid rafts structure is essential for GluR agonist - induced tyrosine phosphorylation of GluA2 , which exhibits the importance of lipid rafts as enzymatic reactive sites for Src family PTKs - mediated AMPA receptor modiﬁcation . Materials and methods Drugs and antibodies Filipin III and Optiprep TM , a non - ionic iodixanol - based density gradient medium , were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich ( St . Louis , MO , USA ) . Anti - GluA2 N - terminal monoclonal antibody ( MAB397 , Chemicon , Temecula , CA , USA ) , anti - GluA2 phospho tyrosine 876 polyclonal antibodies ( JH3410 , Hayashi and Huganir , 2004 ; Hu et al . , 2010 ; Yong et al . , 2020 ) , anti - Fyn monoclonal antibody ( F19720 , Transduction Laboratories , Lexington , KY , USA ) , and anti - Caveolin1 polyclonal antibodies ( N - 20 , sc - 894 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA , USA ) were used for the experiments . Primary neuron culture and stimulation High - density cultured cortical neurons were prepared on poly - L - lysine coated culture dishes of 60 mm diameter dish as described previously ( Hayashi and Huganir , 2004 ) . Cultured cortical neurons ( 10 6 cells per lane ) were used between 3 and 4 weeks [ at 24 , 29 , 31 , and 34 days in vitro ( DIV ) ] after plating for biochemical experiments . For stimulation of AMPA receptors , cortical culture neurons at 25 – 26 days DIV were washed three times with 3 ml of extracellular artiﬁcial cerebrospinal ﬂuid ( aCSF ) solution containing 15 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 5 , 140 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM glucose , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , and 0 . 12 % NaHCO 3 . The extracellular solution was replaced by a 2 ml aCSF solution containing 5 µ M TTX to inhibit neuronal activity . Then , cultured cortical neurons were treated with or without 10 µ g / ml Filipin III and incubated in the same buﬀer at 37 ◦ C for 10 min before stimulation with 100 µ M AMPA for 10 min . An amount of 2 . 5 mg / ml of Filipin III dissolved in DMSO was prepared at the time of use as a stock solution , and 8 µ l Filipin III ( ﬁnal 10 µ g / ml ) solution or DMSO was added to extracellular solutions of cultured cortical neurons ( Gimpl et al . , 1997 ; Foster et al . , 2003 ; Lambert et al . , 2006 ) . Analysis of proteins Neurons were lysed in 1 . 2 ml buﬀer containing 50 mM Tris – HCl , pH8 . 0 , 1 % Triton X - 100 , 150 mM NaCl , 20 mM EDTA , 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 100 µ g / ml phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride ( PMSF ) , 2 µ g / ml aprotinin , 1 µ g / ml pepstatin , and 0 . 5 µ g / ml leupeptin .

Blocking and washing solutions for immunoblotting were 5 % skim milk and 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 in tris - buﬀered saline ( TBS ) ( 50 mM Tris – HCl , pH 7 . 5 , and 150 mM NaCl ) and TBS containing 0 . 05 % Triton X - 100 , respectively . Reactive bands were visualized with the electrochemiluminescence ( ECL ) . Chemiluminescent images were acquired using the ImageQuant LAS 4000 mini imager ( GE Healthcare , Tokyo , Japan ) . The phosphorylation ratio was estimated by comparing the intensity of each band : tyrosine phosphorylated GluA2 to total GluA2 protein amount in the cultured neurons and control without ﬁlipin III treatment was deﬁned as 100 % . Density gradient fractionation Cultured neurons at 27 – 35 DIV were washed twice with 1 . 0 ml cold phosphate - buﬀered saline ( PBS ) and scraped in 1 . 5 ml buﬀer containing 20 mM Tris – HCl , pH7 . 5 , 250 mM Sucrose , 50 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , a cocktail of protease inhibitors . Collected neurons were mechanically homogenized on ice by ﬁve passages through a 22G syringe needle , followed by centrifugation at 1 , 000 × g for 10 min at 4 ◦ C . The pellets were resuspended in 0 . 5 ml buﬀer and repeatedly homogenized by ﬁve passages through the 22G syringe needle and centrifugation . Combined 2 . 0 ml supernatants were adjusted to 35 % Optiprep in a total of 4 . 8 ml and overlaid with 2 . 5 ml of each 30 , 20 , and 5 % Optiprep prepared in the same buﬀer . The gradients were spun at 40 , 000 rpm for 3 h at 4 ◦ C in an SW41 rotor using a Beckman ultracentrifuge . The interface 5 and 20 % boundary ( 900 µ l ) was collected , followed by the addition of two - thirds volume ( 600 µ l ) of the same buﬀer containing 1 . 25 % Triton X - 100 ( ﬁnal 0 . 5 % ) , and lysed for 60 min at 4 ◦ C with rotation . Then , lysates were adjusted to 35 % Optiprep in a totally of 3 . 6 ml and overlaid with 7 . 5 ml of 30 % Optiprep and 1 . 5 ml of 0 % Optiprep prepared in the same buﬀer containing 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 . The gradients were spun at 40 , 000 rpm for 5 h at 4 ◦ C in the SW41 rotor . Six fractions were collected from top to bottom of centrifuge tubes ( Smart et al . , 1995 ; Lafont et al . , 1998 , 1999 ; Oliferenko et al . , 1999 ; Lindwasser and Resh , 2001 ; Inoue et al . , 2004 ; Nakagawa et al . , 2005 ; Pike et al . , 2005 ) . An amount of 2 ml of each fraction was diluted by the addition of equal volume ( 2 ml ) PBS and concentrated by ultraﬁltration with Centricon30 ( Amicon ) . Fractionated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with each antibody . For the estimation of signal intensities , the rafts fraction ( Fr . 1 ) in Figure 1B and the soluble fractions ( Fr . 6 ) in Figures 1C , D were deﬁned as 100 % .

Results Tyrosine phosphorylated GluA2 is concentrated in the lipid rafts fraction To clarify the submembrane domain where tyrosine phosphorylated AMPA receptors localize , subcellular membrane fractionation was performed using Optiprep - density gradients . The method for the preparation of lipid rafts involves the extraction of crude membrane fraction from cultured cortical neurons in 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , followed by Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience 03 frontiersin . org fnsyn - 14 - 921772 October 27 , 2022 Time : 12 : 13 # 4 Hayashi 10 . 3389 / fnsyn . 2022 . 921772 separation of the low - density raft membranes in an Optiprep - density gradient ( Figure 1A ) . Localization of Fyn PTK , as representative of palmitoylated Src family PTKs , and lipids raft - associated protein Caveolin - 1 ( Nabi and Le , 2003 ; Michel and Bakovic , 2007 ) were examined to conﬁrm accurate isolation of lipid rafts domain ( Figure 1A ) . Tyrosine phosphorylated GluA2 signals were majorly detected in fraction 1 , corresponding to the lipid rafts fraction ( Figure 1B , n = 3 , p = 0 . 0020 ) . Whereas most GluA2 proteins were detected in the detergent soluble fraction indicated as fraction 6 ( Figure 1C , n = 3 , p = 0 . 0004 ) , tyrosine - phosphorylated GluA2 was remarkably concentrated in the lipid rafts fraction ( Figure 1D , n = 3 , p = 0 . 0315 ) . GluA2 and its tyrosine phosphorylation signals retain at the undetectable level in Fractions 2 – 5 . Reduced GluA2 tyrosine phosphorylation by disruption of cholesterol - enriched membrane fraction Filipin is an antibiotic polyene , which forms a complex with cholesterol in membranes and is widely used to disrupt lipid rafts in cells ( Gimpl et al . , 1997 ; Foster et al . , 2003 ) . Filipin is a mixture of four components , ﬁlipin I , II , III , and IV , and ﬁlipin III is the major component of the ﬁlipin complex , which provides a useful tool for studying the role of lipid rafts in cellular mechanisms ( Lambert et al . , 2006 ) . Treatment of cultured neurons with ﬁlipin III blocks cholesterol - mediated endocytosis of membrane proteins ( Auriac et al . , 2010 ) . As we previously showed ( Hayashi and Huganir , 2004 ) , stimulation of cultured cortical neurons with an agonist AMPA increases phosphorylation of GluA2 C - terminus at Tyr876 without aﬀecting GluA2 protein expression amounts ( Figure 2 ) . Pretreatment of cortical neurons with ﬁlipin III signiﬁcantly suppressed the AMPA - induced GluA2 tyrosine phosphorylation in cortical neurons [ Figure 2 , n = 4 each , ANOVA , F ( 3 , 15 ) = 19 . 79 , p = 0 . 0042 ] . Discussion Src family PTKs - mediated phosphorylation of the AMPA receptor and subsequent exchange of GluA2 - binding proteins play crucial roles in the endocytosis of GluA2 - containing synaptic AMPA receptors ( Hayashi and Huganir , 2004 ; Gladding et al . , 2009 ; Hu et al . , 2010 ; Yong et al . , 2020 ) . Src family PTKs are associated with gangliosides - containing lipid rafts prepared from the rodent brain ( Kasahara et al . , 1997 , 2000 ) . Our previous study showed that stimulation with AMPA induces the activation of AMPA receptor - associated Src family PTKs in cultured neurons ( Hayashi et al . , 1999 ) . The experimental data presented here revealed that tyrosine phosphorylated - AMPA receptors are concentrated in lipid rafts ( Figure 1 ) . Moreover , GluR agonist stimulation - induced FIGURE2 Effects of ﬁlipin III treatment on AMPA - induced tyrosine phosphorylation of GluA2 in cultured cortical neurons . Cultured cortical neurons were treated with DMSO or 10 µ g / ml Filipin III for 10 min , followed by stimulation with 100 µ M AMPA for 10 min . Cell lysates from cultured cortical neurons were immunoblotted with anti - GluA2CpY or anti - GluA2 antibodies to quantify tyrosine phosphorylated GluA2 and GluA2 protein expression . Typical blots as representatives are shown ( Top ) . The ratio of tyrosine phosphorylated GluA2 to GluA2 protein amounts is statistically analyzed ( Bottom ) . Error bars represent SEM . ∗ p < 0 . 05 , compared with control . tyrosine phosphorylation of AMPA receptors occurs in a lipid rafts - dependent manner ( Figure 2 ) . Treatment with ﬁlipin III should disrupt the accumulation of AMPA receptors and Src family PTKs in the lipid rafts , which prevent subsequent Src family PTKs - mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of GluA2 . Collectively , these results suggest that lipid rafts may provide a place for eﬀective AMPA receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and they consequently enable receptor internalization from the synaptic surface . We have previously shown that Src family PTKs - mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of GluA2 is detected in the cerebral cortex , hippocampus , and cerebellum of the intact mouse brain to a greater or lesser degree ( Hayashi and Huganir , 2004 ) . Moreover , stimulation with glutamate , AMPA , or N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) upregulates GluA2 tyrosine phosphorylation and induces the following AMPA receptor internalization in cultured cortical neurons . The existence of signaling pathways is predictable , including AMPA receptors - , NMDA receptors - , and mGluRs - mediated activation of downstream Src family PTKs , whereas crosstalk among these signaling still remains unclear . Here , I showed that the lipid rafts are required for the most essential AMPA receptor - mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience 04 frontiersin . org fnsyn - 14 - 921772 October 27 , 2022 Time : 12 : 13 # 5 Hayashi 10 . 3389 / fnsyn . 2022 . 921772 FIGURE3 Model of the role of AMPA receptor palmitoylation in lipid rafts . Diagram of the role of AMPA receptor palmitoylation and tyrosine phosphorylation . ( A , B ) The balance between palmitoylated and de - palmitoylated forms of the AMPA receptor can be regulated by glutamate receptor agonists treatment , suggesting that synaptic activity can regulate the steady - state level of AMPA receptor palmitoylation . De - palmitoylation of the AMPA receptor on the C - terminal site increases the receptors’ afﬁnity for 4 . 1N , which stabilizes AMPA receptors at the synaptic surface by the interaction of 4 . 1N with F - actin and spectrin ( A ) . In contrast , the palmitoylated forms of surface AMPA receptors are less stably associated with the synaptic membrane and are more susceptible to neuronal activity - induced internalization ( B ) . ( C ) The palmitoylated AMPA receptors are assumed to translocate to the synaptic membrane lipid rafts , where the palmitoylated Src family protein tyrosine kinases are concentrated . Phosphorylation of GluA2 at Tyr876 by Src family protein tyrosine kinases induces the exchange of AMPA receptor - binding proteins from GRIP1 / 2 to PICK1 and the receptor interaction with BRAG2 , which drive endocytosis of surface AMPA receptors . GluA2 as a place of phosphorylation reaction . Future analysis will reveal the detailed upstream signaling , which regulates the activation and localization of Src family PTKs in the lipid rafts . Covalent attachments of the most abundant saturated fatty acid , palmitate , to integral membrane receptors as well as to signaling molecules such as Src family PTKs are supposed to increase proteins’ aﬃnity to lipid rafts ( Linder and Deschenes , 2007 ; Fukata et al . , 2016 ) . Many neuronal receptors and ion channels are regulated by their reversible modiﬁcation of the palmitoylation and depalmitoylation cycle ( Kang et al . , 2008 ; Shipston , 2011 ; Borroni et al . , 2016 ; Hayashi , 2021a ) . In various modiﬁcations evolutionarily established in the vertebrate glutamatergic excitatory synapses , the most probable mechanism that forces AMPA receptors to translocate into lipid rafts microdomain is the palmitoylation of the receptors themselves ( Hayashi et al . , 2005 ; Matt et al . , 2019 ; Hayashi , 2021a , b ) . These ﬁndings oﬀer a possible model that links tyrosine phosphorylation and palmitoylation of AMPA receptors as follows . Depalmitoylated AMPA receptors are trapped on synaptic action ﬁbers through their binding with the 4 . 1N - spectrin protein complex and these unmodiﬁed AMPA receptors show stable surface expression ( Figure 3A ) . Neuronal activity - induced palmitoylation of AMPA receptors should serve as a trigger for the translocation of the receptors to lipid rafts domain ( Figure 3B ) . There , lipid rafts - enriched palmitoylated Src family PTKs phosphorylate GluA2 at Tyr876 , followed by an exchange of GluA2 - binding scaﬀolding proteins from GRIP1 / 2 to PICK1 and interaction with BRAG2 , which accelerate AMPA receptor endocytosis ( Figure 3C ) . Appropriate membrane localization of receptor proteins generally ensure dynamic regulation of the receptor functions in neurons . Our studies suggest the signiﬁcance of crosstalk between two distinct signaling pathways , tyrosine phosphorylation and palmitoylation of AMPA receptors in compartmentalized synapses .
