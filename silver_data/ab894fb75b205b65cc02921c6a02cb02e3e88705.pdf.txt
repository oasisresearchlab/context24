Methods : Outbreak studies were performed between 11 November and 15 December 2020 when the wild - type variant of SARS - CoV - 2 was dominant . Clusters of SARS - CoV - 2 infections within schools were identified through a prospective school surveillance study . All school contacts of cluster cases , irrespective of symptoms , were invited for PCR testing twice within 48 hrs and 4 - 7 days later . Combined NTS and saliva samples were collected at each time point along with data on recent exposure and symptoms . Surface and active air samples were collected in the school environment . All samples were PCR - tested and sequenced when possible . Results : Out of 263 sampled school contacts , 24 tested SARS - CoV - 2 positive ( secondary attack rate 9 . 1 % ) , of which 62 % remained asymptomatic and 42 % had a weakly positive test result . Phylogenetic analysis on 12 subjects from 2 schools indicated a cluster of 8 and 2 secondary cases , respectively , but also other distinct strains within outbreaks . Of 51 collected air and 53 surface samples , none were SARS - CoV - 2 positive . Conclusion : Our study confirmed within school SARS - CoV - 2 transmission and substantial silent circulation , but also multiple introductions in some cases .

Throughout most of the first year of the pandemic , the Dutch government implemented only a limited set of COVID - 19 preventive measures in educational settings to minimise educational disruption . Between November and December 2020 , we conducted a series of four detailed outbreak investigations in schools that reported clusters of SARS - CoV - 2 infections . At the time , all primary and secondary schools were open and had full occupancy . There was little prior immunity against SARS - CoV - 2 , vaccines were not yet available and the wild - type variant with the D614G mutation was dominant at the time of the study . The aim of the outbreak investigations was to provide a more detailed analysis on transmission risk in secondary school settings under the prevailing community incidence and COVID - 19 mitigation policy , and to gain insight into the potential role of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission via air and surfaces in schools . Methods The outbreak investigations were part of a prospective school surveillance study that evaluates the interactions between indoor air quality , ventilation , environmental SARS - CoV - 2 contamination and transmission . At the time the outbreak investigations were performed , physical distancing ( > 1 . 5 meters ) in schools was implemented for staff - staff and staff - student interactions , but not required in or outside school among children below 18 years . Students and teachers who tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 had to self - isolate at home . Classroom contacts were not quarantined unless considered a close contact , defined as exposure of > 15 minutes at < 1 . 5 meter distance to a SARS - CoV - 2 infected individual . From December 2020 onwards , mask mandates were in place for students and staff during movement . Seated students and staff did not wear masks . Schools were recommended to increase hand hygiene and the degree of ventilation , plastic shields were installed on teacher desks and all school - based extracurricular activities were cancelled . Testing of asymptomatic close contacts was implemented during the study period ( 1 December 2020 ) . Other national COVID - 19 measures in place at the time , are described in the supplement . All schools participating in the prospective study kept daily logs of reported SARS - CoV - 2 infections among students and staff and whether there was a possible epidemiological link between cases . Schools notified the study team if a cluster was identified , which was defined as three or more cases in the same school within two weeks of whom at least two cases had an epidemiological link . An epidemiological link was defined as cases who shared ( class ) rooms for at least two course hours in the .

If the most recent index case ( s ) belonging to the cluster had been attending school in the 48 hours prior to symptom onset or PCR test result , an outbreak investigation was initiated . Outbreak study A school visit was scheduled within 48 hours after the notification of a cluster to sample participating school contacts . School contacts were defined as students and staff who had shared a ( class ) room for at least two course hours in the two days preceding symptom onset in the index case or , if this was unknown , the date of a positive test . A sampling location at the school was set - up where participants could self - collect a combined mid - turbinate NTS sample and a saliva sample under direct supervision of trained study staff after instructions had been provided . For participants who were not present at school , samples were self - collected under supervision of study staff at their home address . Participants also completed a questionnaire including basic demographics , other recent exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 infected individuals ( other than school index case ) , prior infection and presence of COVID - 19 like symptoms . A second sampling visit was scheduled after 4 - 7 days , depending on the weekends , for a follow - up NTS and saliva sample from each participant , along with a follow - up questionnaire on recent exposure , symptoms and whether household members tested positive since the previous visit . For a schematic overview of the study design see Supplementary Figure S1 . All samples were transported to the laboratory the same day and participants were notified about the results of the PCR test within 48 hours . Positive results were followed by self - isolation as per national policy . Saliva samples were stored at - 80 ℃ and analysed at a later time . At the first visit , extensive air and surface sampling took place in school buildings ( see Supplementary Methods and Figure S1 ) . Briefly , air samples and surface swab samples were collected at three locations : 1 ) classrooms attended by students previously in contact with the index cases , 2 ) the teachers’ lounge and 3 ) the school cafeteria area . At each location , air sampling consisted of twice a 6 - hr filtration - based sample , once a 6 - hr cyclone - based sample and once a 1 . 5 - hr impingement - sample ( school cafeteria and teachers’ lounge only ) . Surface swab samples of high - and low - touch surface areas were collected as described previously [ 1 ] . A total of five samples were taken in each of the areas above and , when possible , from the classroom where index case teachers were located prior to self - isolation . Field blank samples were collected every other outbreak measurement for air samples , and each outbreak for surface swab samples . Samples were sent to the laboratory at 4 °C and processed within 24 - hours . Sample analysis Detailed methods are described in the Supplementary Methods . NTS were collected in tubes containing virus transport medium and total nucleic acid was extracted as described [ 2 ] . Oral fluid was collected using the ORACOL S10 saliva collection system ( Malvern Medical Developments ) . Total .

RT - qPCR was performed as described previously [ 2 ] , with some modifications on the primers and probe of the RdRP - gene ( see Supplementary Methods ) . From the environmental samples , RNA was isolated using an in - house method as described before [ 3 ] . Samples were tested with a SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR , targeting the E gene of SARS - CoV - 2 [ 2 ] . Sequencing of NTS RT - PCR positive samples with Ct - values < 32 was performed using an amplicon - based approach as described [ 4 ] . For RT - PCR positive saliva samples , sequencing was performed using the Nanopore protocol [ 5 , 6 ] with several modifications ( see Supplementary Methods for details ) . The sequences have been submitted to GISAID ( www . gisaid . org ; accession ID : EPI _ ISL _ 722426 - 722430 , EPI _ ISL _ 722432 , EPI _ ISL _ 722290 , EPI _ ISL _ 722334 . A secondary case was defined as a school contact participating in the study and testing positive by RT - PCR in at least one of the samples collected during initial or follow - up visits . According to standardised local lab protocols a Ct - value cut - off for sample positivity was set < 40 for both targets or at < 33 if only one target was positive . Samples were defined as ‘weakly positive’ if the Ct - value for a single target was between 33 - 40 and negative for the other target . Statistical analysis SARS - CoV - 2 incidence rates per schools were calculated by dividing the number of reported infections by the total number of students and staff members . Next , the secondary attack rate ( SAR ) per cluster was determined by dividing the secondary cases by the total number of participants , both overall and stratified for teachers and students . Case characteristics , school attendance , presence of symptoms and time since exposure were graphically displayed for all secondary cases . For each secondary case , we compared RT - PCR results for NTS versus saliva by means of a paired t - test on the gene with the lowest Ct - value of each specimen type . All successfully sequenced NTS and saliva samples from both test rounds were combined in a phylogenetic reconstruction and are depicted per sample type . If the sequence was available from both test rounds , only the sequence of first round was included in the tree . We also included human sequences from the municipalities of the respective schools as background data , which was retrieved from GISAID . SPSS version 26 . 0 . 0 . 1 ( IBM ) , and R version 4 . 0 . 3 ( R core team ) was used for data management and statistical analysis . Ethical statement The study was not subjected to the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act ( WMO ) and therefore no Ethics review was needed . Informed consent was obtained prior to sampling from participants and , for those < 16 years of age , their legal representatives . .

The overall weekly incidence of SARS - CoV - 2 across the four participating schools during the study period varied between 299 - 820 per 100 , 000 students and staff members , while the weekly incidence in het Dutch population during the same period varied between 184 and 430 per 100 , 000 inhabitants ( Table 1 ) [ 7 , 8 ] . Index cluster size varied between 3 and 12 cases ( Supplementary Table S1 ) . In total , 27 SARS - CoV - 2 index cases belonged to the clusters , including 6 staff members and 21 students . A total of 1121 school contacts were invited to participate ( Figure 1 ) . Cluster C further developed during the outbreak study and additional school contacts were therefore invited during the second sample round . The number of staff exposed to a teacher index case could not be determined reliably as staff - staff contacts occur mostly in the teachers’ lounge . Therefore , all staff members were invited , but informed that they should only participate if they had been in close contact with any of the index cases . In total , 263 school contacts participated , including 93 staff members ( Figure 1 ) . The participation rate was 10 . 6 % to 41 . 8 % among staff , and 7 . 5 % to 56 . 1 % among students ( Supplementary Table S2 ) . Eighteen subjects participated only in the first test round . In total 508 paired NTS and saliva samples were collected . Secondary cases In total , 24 school contacts ( 9 . 1 % ) tested positive by RT - PCR in at least one sample ( Figure 1 ) . Of these , 10 ( 41 . 6 % ) had a weakly positive PCR result . The SAR by cluster varied between 1 . 8 - 18 . 1 % and was generally higher among students compared to staff ( Supplementary Table S2 ) . Table 2 describes the temporal pattern of exposure , school attendance , SARS - CoV - 2 PCR results and symptoms among secondary cases . Out of the 21 secondary cases of whom we obtained symptom data , only eight ( 38 . 1 % ) were symptomatic at any time during follow - up . In four of these participants , the symptoms were present at the time of first sample collection . Notably , three of them attended school while symptomatic . The other four subjects developed symptoms one to three days after the positive PCR result . Out of the 13 asymptomatic individuals , 8 ( 62 % ) were weakly positive , while none of the symptomatic individuals were weakly positive . Onwards SARS - CoV - 2 infection among household members was reported for 2 out of 21 ( 10 % ) . One of the participants from school A was already quarantined because of a positive test of a household member , while a student from cluster C reported a family member who tested positive the same day . .

Discrepancies in test results between the two , self - collected , specimens were observed in 19 out of 46 pairs ( Supplementary Table S3 ) . Eight of the 24 secondary cases tested positive only in saliva and five only in NTS . Testing of a second NTS and saliva sample after 3 - 7 days increased the detection rate by 33 % . Lowest Ct - values were detected for samples taken between day five and eight since last exposure and in symptomatic individuals ( Figure 2 ) . In school A and C multiple secondary cases were present which allowed to investigate confirmation of a cluster of infection by phylogenetic analysis ( Figure 3 ) . A total of 12 individuals were successfully sequenced of which 9 and 3 originated from school A and C respectively . In school A , the SARS - CoV - 2 RNA sequences originating from eight participants formed a cluster . Demographic data revealed that all participants from this cluster were students and had only been in contact with each other during school hours . They came from two different classes who had been in contact with the same index case teacher . All participants within the cluster did not report any household members or other contacts testing positive before their positive test result . In addition , in one student a divergent strain was identified , indicating a separate instruction . In school C , four SARS - CoV - 2 sequences from two students phylogenetically clustered . They were classmates and only had been in contact with each other and the student index case during classes . One of the students reported a household member who tested positive the same day . For this school , also a phylogenetically distinct strain within the outbreak was identified , again showing a second , independent introduction . These results clearly show genetically linked transmission clusters , but also show other distinct strains within outbreaks , indicative of multiple introductions . Environmental sampling of air and surfaces In total 104 environmental samples were collected from clusters B , C and D at the start of each investigation . All the 51 collected air and 53 surface swab samples tested negative for SARS - CoV - 2 . All field blank samples tested negative in PCR . For a complete overview of sample locations and results , see Supplementary Results and Table S4 . Discussion This detailed outbreak investigation among school contacts of four SARS - CoV - 2 clusters using repeated PCR testing of two complementary specimens yielded a positivity rate of 9 . 1 % with the majority of cases ( 61 . 9 % ) being asymptomatic . The sequence results together with detailed contact data indicate the presence of a cluster within school A . Likewise , in school C the sequencing and contact tracing data suggest that two individuals within the same class had infected each other . Combined , these observations indicate that silent transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in secondary schools may occur . Yet , no .

Reported ( SAR ) values from other school outbreak investigations from the same period that used comparable methodology ranged between 0 . 0 to 6 . 5 % [ 9 – 18 ] . The majority of the secondary cases in these studies were asymptomatic ( 47 . 8 % - 66 . 6 % ) , in line with our observations [ 10 , 17 ] . Studies that used symptom based testing alone reported no secondary cases [ 19 , 20 ] . In comparison , in our study symptom - based testing by means of a single NTS as was the policy at the time , would only have identified six cases yielding a SAR of 2 . 3 % compared to 9 . 1 % . In Israel , a large outbreak was reported in a school 10 days after reopening . Testing of the complete school community revealed an attack rate of 13 . 2 % in students and 16 . 6 % in staff members of which 47 . 8 % were asymptomatic [ 21 ] . Combined , these results illustrate the importance of the applied testing strategy in estimating outbreak sizes in ( school ) populations , where silent circulation of SARS - CoV - 2 infections can be easily missed . In our study , we increased our detection rate by repeated testing after seven days and combining NTS and saliva samples , which could partially explain our higher detection rate compared to other outbreak studies . It should be noted that 10 individuals were weakly positive and for mitigating transmission ( early ) detection of such cases may be less important . Nevertheless , the role of asymptomatic and pre - symptomatic infections in propagating the COVID - 19 epidemic is now widely acknowledged , in particular among school students because of their more intense contact patterns . In our study , onward transmission to household members was suggested for 10 % of the secondary cases for whom this data was available . Although we found evidence of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission within secondary schools , the lack of detectable SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in collected air and surface samples suggests that major environmental contamination is uncommon in schools under the prevailing conditions at the time of the study . This is in contrast with findings from previous outbreak investigations conducted at mink farms and nursing homes , where similar sampling technologies were applied [ 1 , 22 ] . In these studies , several air samples collected in COVID - 19 infected mink farms , and a high percentage of both air and surface swab samples collected in rooms in nursing homes with SARS - CoV - 2 positive patients [ 1 , 22 ] . A previous study in London also found limited evidence of SARS - CoV - 2 contamination in school environments [ 18 ] . Only in a minority ( < 2 - 5 % ) of surface swab samples taken in both the classrooms of index cases and the washrooms , low amounts of viral RNA could be detected , some of which were collected before deep cleaning took place . In this study only 1 / 68 ( 1 . 5 % ) of the air samples was positive for SARS - CoV - 2 [ 18 ] . .

First , schools implemented various measures to increase ( hand ) hygiene and prevented social gatherings . Second , schools increased their ventilation regimes by opening doors and windows and installing new mechanical ventilation systems . Although , the effect of these interventions on SARS - CoV - 2 transmission is still unclear . Third , in the nursing home and mink farm studies samples were collected in the vicinity of acute phase shedding SARS - CoV - 2 patients or minks . This is in contrast with the secondary schools , where the known cases were isolated at home . Moreover , most infected students and teachers were asymptomatic or pauci - symptomatic which is known to be associated with lower infectiousness [ 23 ] . Lastly , SARS - CoV - 2 spread and transmission is suggested to be a more local phenomenon , suggesting direct droplet contact and / or close range aerosol ( up to several meters ) as the dominant route of transmission in the school environment [ 22 , 24 ] . The major strength of this study is that we collected a large amount of data in school contacts ( e . g . sequencing , symptom onset and recent exposure ) , irrespective of symptoms , which provided an opportunity to obtain extensive virological and contact tracing information from the subjects . Furthermore , we increased our detection rate by combining specimens and testing twice . Lastly , the combined sampling of the environment and school contacts facilitated identification of transmission mechanisms within secondary schools . However , some limitations need to be addressed : First , we investigated only four outbreaks and observed a high variability in SAR between clusters , reflecting the stochasticity in our data . Second , the low participation rate among contacts may have resulted in under - or overestimation of the SAR due to selection bias . Third , we only invited students to participate if they shared a classroom with the index case . Consequently , we may have missed secondary cases among other school contacts with whom the index case spent time during breaks . Fourth , we cannot conclude that the observed SAR solely reflects school transmission rates , because sequencing of samples was incomplete for secondary cases and not available for index cases . The SAR may therefore have been somewhat inflated by simultaneous unrelated introductions . However , apart from two participants in our study , no other participants reported contact with a known case outside the cluster . Lastly , the outbreak investigation was performed during the pre - alpha period when school aged children were not vaccinated and there was less prior immunity in the population . Therefore , the results should be interpreted in the context of the epidemiological situation at the time . Conclusion In conclusion , our study confirmed within school SARS - CoV - 2 transmission , but also multiple introductions and substantial silent circulation at a time with limited COVID - 19 prevention measures .

Absence of widespread air or surface contamination suggests transmission may have occurred most likely via direct route or close range aerosol transmission route . Repeated testing is complementary and therefore recommended when complete case detection is desired . These insights can contribute to the discussion on the role of secondary schools in the transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 and how to improve future outbreak studies . .
