Introduction The coronavirus 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic has been a pub - lic health crisis of global importance . 1 The impact of acute infection by SARS - CoV - 2 in the paediatric population has been low , as its course is generally mild . 2 , 3 However , the changes the pandemic has imposed on the lives of children and adolescents ( which we will refer to from this point as ‘‘children’’ for the sake of brevity ) has brought their men - tal health into focus . 4 , 5 One of the main changes has been the interruption of their schooling . It is estimated that up to 1500 million youth and children aged less than 20 years did not attend school during the ﬁrst wave of the pandemic . According to an analysis by UNICEF , 6 > 13 % of children aged 10 - - - 19 years had some form of mental health disorder in 2019 . Early data on the impact of COVID - 19 on mental health were ﬁrst reported for the adult population 7 and later for the paediatric population . 8 These studies evinced a deterio - ration of mental health caused by the disease itself but also by the policy and public health measures adopted to con - tain transmission of the virus and respond to the pandemic . 9 Other authors reported substantial increases in the preva - lence of depression and anxiety in children . 10 , 11 In Spain , the pandemic prompted the imposition of home conﬁnement for nearly 3 months and the closure of schools for 6 months . 12 Various domestic studies evinced an increased incidence of stress , anxiety and depression in adolescents . 13 Many parents and caregivers ( which we will refer to from this point as simply ‘‘parents’’ ) noticed changes in their children’s mood and behaviour . 14 A study conducted in our autonomous community , Catalonia , found an increased incidence of mood and behavioural symptoms in young children during the home conﬁnement period . 15 Some studies demonstrated that the impact was greater in socially vulnerable families . 16 Certain authors proposed that the impact on mental health could persist or even increase 2 ARTICLE IN PRESS + Model Anales de Pediatría xxx ( xxxx ) xxx - - - xxx with time , 17 although there is scarce data from population - based and longitudinal studies 18 on the mental health of children during the COVID - 19 pandemic . The aim of the study presented here , ‘‘Paediatrics and Mental Health’’ ( PEDSAME ) , was to assess the mental health of the paediatric population and potentially associated fac - tors at the population level and prospectively in the ﬁrst school year of the COVID - 19 pandemic . Material and methods Study design We conducted a prospective , longitudinal and observational study between September 2020 and July 2021 ( 2020 - - - 2021 school year ) . The study was conducted through the primary care paediatrics research network ( XaRePAP ) of the Sec - tion on Primary Care of the Societat Catalana de Pediatria ( Catalonian Society of Paediatrics ) . This network includes primary care paediatricians and paediatric nurses with full representation of the Catalonian territory , including rural and urban areas . Participants Each participating paediatrician or nurse ( Appendix B in Sup - plementary material ) used a random number list to select a sample of 15 children from their caseloads . The sample consisted of children aged 5 - - - 14 years residing in Catalo - nia included in the caseloads of the participating providers . The exclusion criteria were lack of signed informed consent , inability to contact the patient by telephone and presence of a language barrier . We estimated the necessary sample size based on the size of population aged 5 - - - 24 years in Catalonia ( 833 000 , source : Statistical Institute of Catalonia [ IDESCAT ] ) . 19 The expected prevalence of mental health disorders used as reference was 7 . 5 % . 19 We calculated the sample size required for a preci - sion of 3 % and a 95 % level of conﬁdence . The result was that the sample needed to include a minimum of 297 individual ( calculation made with the Epidat software , version 3 . 1 ) . Data collection Once the sample was selected , we contacted one par - ent / legal tutor per child by telephone to invite them to participate in the study . A link was then provided via electronic mail through the RedCap platform 20 to access all the necessary information about the study , sign the informed consent form and complete the online question - naire ( Appendix B in Supplementary material ) . For families without internet access , we offered the possibility of par - ticipating through an in - person interview . We collected data at 4 timepoints during the school year : start of school year ( September - - - October 2020 ) , end of ﬁrst term ( December 2020 - - - January 2021 ) , end of second term ( March - - - April 2021 ) and end of the school year ( June - - - July 2021 ) . At each time point , the parents completed the par - ent version of the Strengths and Difﬁculties Questionnaire ( SDQ ) 21 in relation to the child at the present moment . They also answered different questions regarding the impact of the COVID - 19 pandemic on the family and household , any psychological symptoms the child may have developed since the previous timepoint , any existing medical or psychiatric diagnoses in the child , and aspects related on sleep pat - terns , appetite , feelings , behaviour , worry and screen use ( Appendix B in Supplementary material ) . The SDQ is a validated instrument for assessment of the risk of psychiatric disorders in minors . 21 It can detect emo - tional and behavioural problems in children aged 5 - - - 17 years . It is composed of 25 items grouped in 5 scales : emotional symptoms , conduct problems , peer relationship problems , hyperactivity / inattention and prosocial behaviour . We used the validated Spanish version of the SDQ , 22 available at www . sdqinfo . com . To allow comparison with prepandemic results , 19 we interpreted the results applying the same cat - egories as the Department of Health of Catalonia : normal ( 0 - - - 13 points ) , possible case ( 14 - - - 16 points ) and probable case ( 17 - - - 40 points ) . Ethical considerations The study was developed in adherence with good clini - cal practice protocols . The PEDSAME was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Jordi Gol Institute of Primary Care Research ( IDIAP ) under code 20 / 142 - PVC . Statistical analysis We performed a descriptive analysis of the sample data . We summarised quantitative data using the mean and compared them with the t - test . We summarised categorical data as percentages and compared them with the (cid:2) 2 test . We con - sidered differences statistically signiﬁcant if the P value was less than 0 . 05 . The total SDQ score was calculated at each time point . For each timepoint , we compared the different variables under study in patients who were ‘‘probable cases’’ ver - sus all other patients . We performed a multivariate analysis by means of binary logistic regression to determine which factors were associated with SDQ scores in the pathological range , including in the model those variables that remained signiﬁcant at every timepoint of the follow - up . The statistical analyses were performed with the soft - ware SPSS , version 25 ( SPSS Inc , Chicago , IL , USA ) . Results Of the 529 children selected at random , 369 were included in the analysis of the ﬁrst timepoint ( September 2020 ) and 321 in the analysis at the end of the study ( July 2021 ) ( 13 % lost to follow - up ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Descriptive analysis of the sample Table 1 summarises the general characteristics of the sam - ple ; it is worth highlighting that 9 . 5 % of the patients had a previous psychiatric or neurodevelopmental disorder diag - nosis . 3 ARTICLE IN PRESS + Model E .

At the beginning of the year , 9 . 8 % of the patients were probable cases of a psychiatric disorder ( while 11 . 1 % were possible cases ) . The percentage of probable cases decreased gradually in the course of the school year , and was lowest in June 2021 with 6 . 2 % probable cases ( and 9 . 7 % possible cases ) ( Fig . 2 ) . 4 ARTICLE IN PRESS + Model Anales de Pediatría xxx ( xxxx ) xxx - - - xxx Figure 2 Trends in abnormal SDQ scores ( probable case ) through the school year . Figure 3 Trends on SDQ scale scores through the school year . In the separate analysis of the SDQ scales ( Fig . 3 ) , con - duct problems and hyperactivity / inattention exhibited clear improvement during the school year . These problems were signiﬁcantly more prevalent in children aged 5 - - - 8 years in the ﬁrst timepoint . Emotional symptoms were the most preva - lent problem at the end of the second term , and problems with peer relationships were the most prevalent at the end of the school year . Children with abnormal SDQ scores in September wor - ried more than those with scores in the normal range . In the course of the year , this difference stopped being signiﬁcant , while a positive perception of the home environment was 5 AR T I C L E I N P R ESS + M od e l E . A l c o v e r B l o c h , A .

None of the variables associated with the COVID - 19 pandemic ( conﬁnement measures , disease in the child or a family member , hospital admissions or deaths ) was associ - ated with abnormal scores in the SDQ . On the other hand , a previous history of psychiatric illness was strongly asso - ciated with having an abnormal SDQ score throughout the follow - up . In the last 2 timepoints , scoring in the abnormal range was also signiﬁcantly associated with the initiation of mental health care ( Table 2 ) . We conducted a logistic regression analysis introducing in the model the 2 variables in which we found statisti - cally signiﬁcant differences between children with normal and abnormal SDQ scores in all 4 timepoints : the perception of the home environment and the having a pre - existing psy - chiatric diagnosis . Table 3 presents the corresponding odds ratios . A positive home environment was associated with normal scores in the SDQ throughout the school year , while having a pre - existing psychiatric diagnosis was associated with abnormal scores in the SDQ . Trends in worrying during the school year Table 4 presents the changes over the school year in the worry of children regarding their own health , the worry of parents regarding health in the family , the perception of the home environment , the impact of COVID - 19 on the family and the potential impact on mental health . Children tended to worry less than their parents ( Fig . 4 ) . The level of worry of families and children about their health were greater in the ﬁrst and second terms and had improved by the end of the third term . The percentage of families that perceived the home environment as very bad decreased signiﬁcantly over time , and at the end of the year none reported a bad home environment . Discussion The results obtained at the beginning of the school year , after a 6 - month closure of schools in Catalonia , yielded a percentage of probable cases of psychiatric disorder of 9 . 8 % among the patients , 23 a clear increase compared to the 7 . 5 % reported before the pandemic . 19 Higher levels of worry in children regarding their own and their family’s health were associated with the presence of mental health problems , especially at the start of the year , while a positive percep - tion of the home environment was associated with a lower risk . None of the variables related to COVID - 19 were asso - ciated with abnormal scores in the SDQ . The proportion of children at risk of mental health disorders decreased grad - ually over the 4 timepoints to 6 . 2 % at the end of the school year . To our knowledge , no study published to date has fol - lowed up a cohort through the entire ﬁrst year of school in 7 AR T I C L E I N P R ESS + M od e l E . A l c o v e r B l o c h , A .

Most studies conducted on the pae - diatric population have been cross - sectional , which carries intrinsic limitations , and only a few have yielded longitudi - nal data . Most of the latter have compared the prepandemic period with a single timepoint in the pandemic . 9 , 24 The COPSY study published data on 2 timepoints covering a longer period . The clearest worsening in mental health occurred between the prepandemic period and the ﬁrst timepoint ( May - - - June 2020 ) , although the mental health of children and adolescents continued to get worse through the second timepoint ( December 2020 - - - January 2021 ) , coincid - ing with a signiﬁcant conﬁnement measures . 25 In contrast , adolescents and young adults in the United States recovered prepandemic levels of mental health earlier , by summer of 2020 . 26 This differed from the results of the PEDSAME study , which found an even higher frequency of mental health problems in the autumn / winter of 2020 ( 9 . 8 % / 8 . 8 % ) , with - out recovery of prepandemic mental health until later , in March and especially June 2021 ( 6 . 2 % ) . The recovery of mental health to prepandemic levels could take longer in children and adolescents compared to adults , 27 perhaps due to the imposition of greater restrictions to their school and social lives . Most studies have identiﬁed adolescents as a subset of the population particularly vulnerable to mental health dis - orders during the COVID - 19 pandemic . 24 , 28 Our study also found a higher frequency of emotional symptoms in this age group compared to prepubertal children . However , we ought to underscore that the most affected age group was children aged 5 - - - 8 years , a difference that was signiﬁcant in the ﬁrst timepoint , in agreement with other studies that also used the SDQ or equivalent instruments . 29 , 30 This could be due to a frequent focus on internalizing disorders , such as depres - sion and anxiety , 18 , 31 while little attention has been paid to externalising disorders 32 ( conduct disorder or attention - deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder ) , the incidence of which , as observed in our study , is higher at younger ages . The SDQ has proven to be a useful instrument to assess the risk of mental health disorders in children . It allows assessment , on one hand , of internalizing symptoms and , on the other , exter - nalising symptoms , which are more prevalent in younger children and which may go undetected . The restrictions imposed in successive waves , although generally less strict compared to the initial home conﬁ - nement measure , could explain the greater impact on the mental health of younger children , who need spaces outside the home to move around and socialize , as opposed to ado - lescents who can partly make up for restrictions through online social interaction . In younger children , the inabil - ity to understand the reasons for conﬁnement and other changes in their routine on account of the pandemic could contribute to the increase in anxiety and suffering related to COVID - 19 . 29 , 33 When it came to the variables associated with changes in mental health , we found that the level of worry of both children and parents regarding health , identiﬁed as a deter - minant of mental health , 34 decreased over the school year . In fact , only the worry of children was signiﬁcantly associ - ated with an increased risk of mental health problems , and only at the beginning of the school year . On the other hand , a positive perception of the home environment was associ - ated with adequate mental health throughout the follow - up . Numerous studies have found that the level of anxiety 10 or neuroticism of parents 35 is associated with abnormal SDQ results in children . 36 Several authors 25 , 37 have found that a positive home environment ( adequate social support and good communication within the family ) was associated with better mental health status in children , and especially in adolescents , during the pandemic . 38 On the other hand , none of the variables directly related to COVID - 19 was sig - niﬁcantly associated with mental health . Contrary to the ﬁndings of Matalí - Costa and Camprodon - Rosanas , 29 we did not ﬁnd an association between a death in the family and less favourable results in the SDQ . The CLoCk study , conducted in England , also did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences in the fre - quency of abnormal SDQ scores between children that had positive SARS - CoV - 2 test results and children who did not . 39 The variable associated most strongly with abnormal results in the SDQ was a previous diagnosis of psychiatric or neu - rodevelopmental disorders , in agreement with the previous literature , 32 , 40 as was to be expected . The analysis of the data collected in the PEDSAME study throughout the 2020 - - - 2021 school year show that , in spite of experiencing the pandemic , the percentage of children con - sidered probable cases of mental disorder decreased over the year . Each of the timepoints happened to coincide with the different waves of the COVID - 19 pandemic in Spain , in spite of which the percentage of children with SDQ scores in the abnormal range kept decreasing . It is possible that the relaxation of social distancing measures ( opening schools and allowing a degree of social contact ) played a part in this improvement . Several studies have evinced the neg - ative impact of school closures on the mental health of children . 4 , 24 , 25 , 40 While the PEDSAME study was not designed to assess the role of schools in paediatric mental health , the progressive decrease in mental health problems over the school year supports this hypothesis and could support the exertion of extreme caution in imposing school closures in the future . The most important limitation of the study is that we did not have questionnaires completed by the children them - selves from a certain age . Internalizing symptoms are more easily identiﬁed if the source is the patient versus a proxy ; nevertheless , the analysis detected an increase in emotional symptoms in the subgroup aged 12 - - - 14 years . The mother completed the questionnaire in 86 . 2 % of cases , a sex dispar - ity that could be a source of bias . This is a consistent issue across studies . 29 , 34 , 39 We controlled for the risk of selection bias associated with differences in internet access by offer - ing an interview , in person or by other means . We ought to highlight that the Catalonian public health system is uni - versal and free of cost for all children , which limits the possibility of selection bias due to socioeconomic or cultu - ral factors . The main strength of the PEDSAME study is that it was conducted in a random sample representative of the population , as opposed to a sample of convenience recruited through social networks or other channels . Secondly , it is one of the few longitudinal studies analysing child and ado - lescent mental health in the context of the pandemic , and the only one at the time of this writing that followed up the sample throughout the entire 2020 - - - 2021 school year , at 4 different timepoints , which allowed an adequate assess - ment of temporal trends in the cohort . The low proportion of participants lost to follow - up ( 13 % ) makes the results robust . 9 ARTICLE IN PRESS + Model E . Alcover Bloch , A . Gatell Carbó , J . V . Balaguer Martínez et al . Additional population - based longitudinal studies would be helpful to gain a better understanding of the impact of pandemics on child and adolescent mental health . This would allow the identiﬁcation and development of the most appropriate measures to confront them . Conclusion The mental health of children and adolescents in Catalo - nia , assessed by means of the SDQ in a paediatric sample , worsened 6 months into the pandemic during the closure of physical schools compared to previous population - based data . During the follow - up of the study cohort , we found that the proportion of children with a SDQ score in the abnor - mal range decreased through the 2020 - - - 2021 school year . The level of worry experienced by children about their own health and that of their family members was associated with the presence of mental health disorders , especially at the beginning of the school year . A positive perception of the home environment was associated with a lower frequency of mental health problems . None of the variables pertaining to COVID - 19 was associated with having SDQ scores in the abnormal range . Conﬂicts of interest The authors have no conﬂicts of interest to declare .
