Data were analysed using thematic analysis . Results This research found that people with disabilities in six countries - representing a diverse geographic spread , with different health systems and COVID - 19 responses - all experienced additional difficulties accessing healthcare during the pandemic . Key barriers to accessing healthcare during the pandemic included changes in availability of services due to systems restructuring , difficulty affording care due to the economic impacts of the pandemic , fear of contracting coronavirus , and a lack of human support to enable care - seeking . Conclusion These barriers ultimately led to decreased utilisation of services which , in turn , negatively impacted their health and wellbeing .

International Journal for Equity in Health ( 2023 ) 22 : 172 Background The COVID - 19 pandemic and measures employed for its containment , such as lockdowns , have severely impacted people’s livelihoods [ 1 – 4 ] , social support networks and access to health [ 5 ] , education [ 6 ] , and general wellbeing [ 7 , 8 ] in ways which are only now beginning to be under - stood . Particularly salient have been impacts on access to healthcare services . The pandemic has placed consider - able strain on health systems , especially in low - and mid - dle - income countries ( LMICs ) , leading to reductions in the availability of routine health services [ 9 ] . Moreover , people have become less willing to seek routine services , possibly out of fear of infection [ 10 ] , and loss of house - hold income has negatively impacted treatment seeking and adherence , and health [ 11 , 12 ] . Equitable access to health is essential for the one bil - lion people with disabilities globally [ 13 , 14 ] . People with disabilities often have greater needs for healthcare : they require both the same general healthcare as people with - out disabilities ( e . g . , sexual and reproductive health , pri - mary care ) , as well as healthcare needs associated with their impairments and underlying health conditions ( e . g . , rehabilitation or specific medications ) [ 15 – 17 ] . Yet , people with disabilities are often underserved by exist - ing health systems [ 18 ] . Even before the emergence of COVID - 19 , people with disabilities frequently encoun - tered barriers to seeking and receiving quality , affordable healthcare services [ 19 – 23 ] . These challenges are due to a confluence of factors , including stigma [ 24 ] , inaccessible services [ 19 ] , lack of appropriate transport to and from healthcare facilities [ 19 ] , and high costs [ 25 , 26 ] . Emerging evidence suggests that people with disabili - ties have encountered marked challenges in accessing healthcare services and supports in the context of the pandemic [ 27 – 30 ] . For example , people with disabilities in the United Kingdom were much more likely to report difficulties accessing healthcare during the initial months of the pandemic compared to people without disabilities [ 29 ] . Further research is needed to explore specific barri - ers to accessing healthcare during the pandemic , and any strategies that promoted continued access to health services in LMICs where the vast majority of people with disabilities live [ 14 , 31 ] . This evidence is essential to inform inclusive responses in future pandemics or share lessons learned and implement in similar settings . Con - sequently , this research set out to explore the experiences of people with disabilities in accessing healthcare during the COVID - 19 pandemic between 2020 and 2021 in six LMICs . Methods Qualitative in - depth interviews were conducted with persons with disabilities in Ghana , Zimbabwe , Viet Nam , Türkiye ( Syrian refugees ) , Bangladesh , and India as part of a larger project exploring the experiences of people with disabilities during the COVID - 19 pandemic and their inclusion in government response activities . For this paper , we are focusing on the experience of people with disabilities in accessing disability - related and general healthcare during the pandemic . Data were collected at different time points in 2020 – 2021 ( Table 1 ) . Selection and recruitment of participants In each setting , interviews were conducted with between 20 and 60 people with disabilities . People with disabilities were recruited through different avenues in each setting . Modes of recruitment included : • Previous quantitative surveys : in Bangladesh , people with disabilities were recruited from recently completed surveys run research team that included questions on disability . In Viet Nam , people with disabilities were recruited from the lists provided by the government of people certified as having disability . • Organizations of Persons with Disabilities ( OPDs ) / Non - Governmental Organizations ( NGOs ) : In all settings , at least a portion of participants were recruited through OPDs / NGOs working with people with disabilities , using membership / contact lists . Participants were purposively selected using these tech - niques to maximise heterogeneity by gender , location , age ( children , working age adults , older adults ) and impair - ment types ( vision , hearing , intellectual / cognitive , physi - cal , psychosocial / mental ) . Participants were contacted by phone and invited to participate . Data collection People with disabilities were interviewed relatively early in the pandemic ( mostly between waves 1 and 2 ) . In most settings , interviews were conducted remotely due to restrictions on in - person meetings at the time of data collection . In Ghana and Zimbabwe , national and local guidance allowed for at least a portion of interviews to be done in - person . Where interviews were conducted remotely , respondents were provided with mobile phone data to engage in the call . All interviewers received a one to two - day training on study methods , disability , and research ethics . They also received in - depth feedback on all pilot interviews which were conducted . In - depth interviews were conducted using a semi - structured interview guide . The interviews lasted approximately an hour , and were audio and / or video recorded , transcribed , and at least a portion trans - lated into English . These guides covered similar domains Page 3 of 12 Hunt et al . International Journal for Equity in Health ( 2023 ) 22 : 172 but were adapted for each setting and piloted prior to use . The full interview guide explored the impact of COVID - 19 amongst people with disabilities across mul - tiple life areas ( e . g . , education , employment , social partic - ipation , household finances ) . The topic guide specifically asked people with disabilities to reflect on their experi - ence accessing the healthcare they required both before the introduction of COVID - 19 and at different stages of the pandemic . Participants were also asked to reflect on barriers and enablers to access , and important avenues for improving the inclusiveness of responses to future pandemics . Details of country data collection are shown in Table 1 . Ethical considerations Ethics approval for this study was obtained from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and national review boards in each country : Medi - cal Research Council of Zimbabwe ( MRCZ ) ( No . MRCZ / A / 2731 ) in Zimbabwe ; Koc University Commit - tee on Human Research ( 2020 . 306 . IRB3 . 113 ) in Türkiye ; Ethical Review Board For Biomedical Research of Hanoi University of Public Health ( No . 427 / 2021 / YTCC - HD3 ) in Viet Nam ; Institutional Review Board , BRAC James P Grant School of Public Health , BRAC University ( IRB Reference No . IRB - 22 March’21 − 008 ) in Bangladesh ) ; Institutional Ethics Committee , Indian Institute of Pub - lic Health Hyderabad ( IIPHH / TRCIEC / 22 / 3 / 2020 ) ; and Ghana Health Service Ethics Review Committee ( GHS - ERC009 / 06 / 20 ) in Ghana . All research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki . Local OPDs , NGOs , and other community networks known to the country research teams were asked to advertise the study . Lists of phone numbers of individu - als interested in participating based on the initial advert were provided to study staff ( usually the local Principal Investigator ( PI ) or project manager working under the PI’s supervision ) , who contacted them by phone to invite them to participate . They were then read the informa - tion sheet for the study by the researcher . Consent was obtained in a way which was accessible to the individual being interviewed . This meant that in some cases , sim - plified , easy read versions of information sheets were explained to participants , or the consent form was explained using sign language . If they were interested in participating , then an interview was scheduled for a time and platform ( telephone , Skype , Teams , Zoom etc . ) which suited them . Prior to the commencement of all interviews , informed consent was sought . Consent to participate was sought directly from all participants above the age of consent in each country . Consent from carers was also sought for children below the age of consent and for adults who lack capacity to consent on their own ( e . g . , people with severe intellectual / cognitive impairments ) . In these instances , researchers still sought input from participants directly where possible and rel - evant ( e . g . , children over the age of 10 years ) and in these instances received assent from the participant . Both con - sent and assent were provided orally and recorded for remote interviews and written for in - person interviews . Wherever possible , participants were interviewed directly . Adaptations were put in place to support the participation of people with different impairments .

International Journal for Equity in Health ( 2023 ) 22 : 172 example , sign language interpretation via video con - ference was available for people with profound hear - ing impairments . Simplified interview schedules were used for people with cognitive / intellectual impairments and for younger children . For some children and people with severe difficulties understanding or communicat - ing with available adaptations ( e . g . , people who are Deaf , illiterate and with no knowledge of sign language ; people with severe intellectual / cognitive impairments ) , inter - views with caregivers or joint interviews with caregiv - ers and the person with a disability were used . All data were stored in line with local internal review board ( IRB ) requirements , in password - protected formats and on secure devices . referral services were identified in the event that respondents reported concerns that were an immediate threat to their or others’ safety . Data analysis Data analysis took place in several stages . Firstly , coun - try specific analysis took place . Drawing on the local language transcripts , each country team conducted an in - depth thematic analysis of all transcripts and drafted a report of country - specific themes . This was done to establish a ‘true’ account of the findings based on origi - nal language analysis . Next , cross - country analysis took place . A proportion of transcripts ( 10 – 15 per country ) were translated into English ( using gold standard prac - tices for translation , including forward and back transla - tion ) and independently coded by three researchers ( XH , SH , LMB ) . This was done to allow for cross - cutting find - ings to be identified for the dataset as a whole ( across countries ) . This team coded transcripts interpedently for a country at a time before meeting to discuss prog - ress and resolve any issues arising . For this latter analysis , all transcripts were coded deductively in NVivo 12 ( QRS International , 2022 ) using a coding framework developed using the semi - structured interview guide as a starting point . Additional codes were added based on findings emerging from the data . Themes were developed using thematic analysis . Similarities and differences between countries and sub - groups of participants ( e . g . , by gender , impairment type ) were explored . Finally , the findings of the cross - country analysis were written up and compared to the findings from the country - specific analysis . Final themes and sub - themes for presentation in this paper were discussed with country teams through a group Zoom call to determine the final content . Results Details of participants are outlined in Table 2 . Themes and sub - themes identified through the thematic analysis are outlined in Table 3 . Barriers to access Most participants reported that they required regular access to health services related to their impairment and underlying health conditions ( e . g . , rehabilitation , medi - cations , services for chronic conditions ) . Even before COVID - 19 , many reported difficulties to timely , afford - able access to the services they required . However , the pandemic had created new or exacerbated existing barriers . A wide range of factors – including systems restructuring , costs , fear , and lack of support from pub - lic institutions – led to increased difficulties accessing healthcare among participants during the pandemic . Some of these challenges were direct impacts of pan - demic itself , including fear of becoming ill or over - stretched health systems . Curfew and other travel restrictions made it difficult to attend clinics . There were also barriers created by indirect impacts of the pandemic , such as job loss and increased financial strain . System restructuring In all settings , there were changes in health systems func - tioning during the pandemic , as health personnel and facilities were often reoriented to COVID - 19 prevention and treatment activities . Consequently , many routine ser - vices were affected by staff and resource shortages . Many participants shared difficulties in accessing healthcare they had previously been receiving , pointing to difficul - ties getting appointment times . For example , a 40 - year - old woman with a physical disability in Türkiye explained how “ …there aren’t many appointments . They began to rarely give appointments , only a small amount . Because a lot of pressure happened during COVID - 19 . ” Further , in some settings , the closure of schools led to loss of linked health services that had previously been delivered in schools for children with disabilities . As one caregiver of a six - year - old boy with autism explained , her son used to receive occupational therapy , music , and speech therapy through his school . However , when schools closed , these services were lost . She explained that , as of the time of the interview , it had been two months without services . Costs and ability to pay Cost was a significant barrier to healthcare for people with disabilities during the pandemic . Although cost was a pre - pandemic barrier to seeking healthcare before the pandemic , the pandemic was reported to have affected prices and ability to pay . Some participants felt that the cost of care had increased during the pandemic . Increased costs were , in some cases , linked to disruptions in services , as people were forced to seek alternative , often costlier sources for health services , particularly medications . Further , indirect costs associated with accessing healthcare were Page 5 of 12 Hunt et al . International Journal for Equity in Health ( 2023 ) 22 : 172 reported to have increased , particularly transport . When services that had previously been provided through the public sector were unavailable , some people sought pri - vate providers , if they could afford to , but those who could not pay for private care were excluded . Participant : I used to go to a clinic near my house to write me a medicine that I take periodically because I am sick with blood pressure . Interviewer : What about the time of COVID - 19 ? Participant : It became difficult sometimes I could not buy it and I had to go and buy medicine directly from the pharmacy at a high price because the clinic was not available to give me medicine for free at the time of COVID - 19 . [ 58 - year - old man with a physical disability from Türkiye ] In addition to increased prices , capacity to pay was also affected by economic downturns associated with the pan - demic and restrictions . Many participants were working in the informal sector , without workplace protections , and in jobs that were heavily reliant on customer inter - actions . For instance , in Türkiye , where this study was conducted among a Syrian refugee population , difficulty Table 2 Participant details 2 Country Number of participants Age of participants Gender distribution ( % ) Impairment types ( % ) 3 Bangladesh 60 < 19 years : 20 20 – 59 years : 31 > 60 years : 9 M : 50 % F : 50 % Visual = 18 . 3 % Hearing = 15 % Physical = 16 . 6 % Remembering & concentrating = 16 . 6 % Self - care = 15 % Communication = 11 . 6 % Psychosocial = 2 . 4 % Ghana 58 < 17 years : 20 18 – 59 years : 38 M : 41 % F : 59 % Visual = 26 % Hearing and speaking = 26 % Physical = 34 % Mental / intellectual = 14 % India 61 < 18 years : 16 18 – 64 years : 32 > 65 years : 13 M : 67 % F : 33 % Physical : 24 . 5 % Hearing : 13 . 11 % Vision : 32 . 8 % Intellectual / developmental : 29 . 5 % Mental Health : 0 % Türkiye 60 < 18 years : 12 18 – 64 years : 40 > 65 years : 8 M : 55 % F : 45 % Vision = 22 % Hearing = 17 % Physical = 52 % Intellectual / developmental = 5 % Communication = 5 % Psychosocial = 8 % Viet Nam 23 18 – 40 years : 13 41 – 55 years : 6 > 56 years : 4 M : 53 % F : 47 % Vision = 17 % Hearing and speaking = 7 % Physical = 43 % Intellectual = 17 % Psychosocial = 17 % Zimbabwe 24 < 20 years : 5 21 – 50 years : 10 > 50 years : 9 M : 46 % F : 54 % Vision = 20 % Hearing and speaking = 20 % Physical = 33 % Intellectual / behavioural = 16 % Epilepsy = 16 % 2 Data on demographic information were collected using different forms in each country , and so some categories of reporting cannot be standardised 3 For impairment type , % can be more than 100 % ( i . e . , people with multiple disabilities were counted in each category , so if a person had a physical and hear - ing impairment , they were in both the physical and hearing categories ) .

International Journal for Equity in Health ( 2023 ) 22 : 172 receiving work permits saw participants over - repre - sented in the informal sector and in precarious employ - ment . As such , many individuals lost their livelihoods or experienced reduced income particularly during periods with the strictest restrictions ( e . g . , lockdowns , closures of non - essential businesses ) . As one participant noted : Yes , buying the medicine even during Covid was a major problem because getting money to buy the medicine was difficult but , in the past , I would use the money I got from selling my farming goods to buy it . [ 19 - year - old man with multiple impairments from Zimbabwe ] Fear of illness Many participants felt anxious attending healthcare facil - ities for fear of becoming infected with coronavirus . Hos - pitals in particular were seen as high risk . This concern was a particular problem for accessing disability - related healthcare , which was often delivered in large , tertiary institutions that were at the frontlines of the COVID - 19 response . For example , a man in Viet Nam explained that he had not gone for rehabilitation services in almost two years due to fear of infection : Before the pandemic , I used to go to the hospital for the rehabilitation service to restore my hand and leg functions every two months… Nonetheless , I have not been to the hospital since the beginning of the pandemic because I’m frightened about the disease transmission . Extremely frightened ! [ 50 - year - old man with mental 1 and physical dis - abilities in Viet Nam ] Public facilities were also seen as higher risk . Although more affordable to access , some participants noted that state - sponsored healthcare was often overcrowded and had inadequate hygiene . Private healthcare facilities were seen as safer . However , private facilities were not afford - able for many . Lack of support Many participants reported requiring assistance to seek medical care . Many people with disabilities reported that , before the pandemic , when they went to healthcare ser - vices they often relied on members of the public , friends , family members , or healthcare workers to help them , by , for instance , providing mobility or communication 1 In Viet Nam , impairment type data were validated against participants’ certificate of disability . In Viet Nam , the term mental disability is used to cover psychiatric and psychosocial impairments ( and can be distinguished from intellectual disabilities ) . support . However , given the restrictions on contact asso - ciated with the pandemic , these kinds of informal sup - ports were more limited due to fear of infection or not wanting to be seen violating COVID - 19 guidance . Fur - ther , some informal support structures were disrupted in other ways , such as by people moving to other areas in response to economic or other pressures brought about by the pandemic . These disruptions to informal support posed challenges to people with disabilities trying to get to healthcare facilities . You see , sometimes when I’m in need of something , I go to some friends to ask if they can be of help ; but now that we are not able to visit people at will due to Covid . [ 29 - year - old woman with a physical disability from Ghana ] Impact of disrupted access to healthcare The pandemic - related barriers to accessing healthcare discussed above resulted in negative impacts for many participants , including poorer health and functioning , and feeling left behind in government responses . Poorer health and functioning One of the most common impacts of pandemic - related barriers to accessing healthcare was that participants either discontinued or received less of the services and products they required . Some participants stopped tak - ing their medications or reduced the dosage : I have stopped taking medicine since the pandem - ic’s beginning [ 18 months ] . The most crucial need is food . So , I have to save the money to buy food . I can’t stand the hungriness but the painfulness of the con - ditions . [ 62 - year - old man with a physical disability from Viet Nam ] Now we don’t have a place to sell our stuff and get money for pills . We spend lots of time without pills , but we are supposed to always have pills . [ 53 - year - old woman with epilepsy from Zimbabwe ] Others stopped going for regular check - ups and ther - apy sessions , including one man from Bangladesh who explained that he had stopped going for vision checks because he could no longer afford the hospital visits : Participant : They check how much vision ( level of eyesight ) is left in me . You see , my vision is reduc - ing every moment . They just check how much is left . After checking , they write it down . Page 7 of 12 Hunt et al . International Journal for Equity in Health ( 2023 ) 22 : 172 Interviewer : So , you didn’t go there due to the COVID - 19 , right ? Participant : No , no , I didn’t go there recently . Interviewer : Do you have any plans to go there ? Participant : Well , at this moment , I don’t . [ 32 - year - old man with a vision impairment from Bangladesh ] As a consequence of reduced healthcare access , many participants reported that their health and functioning was deteriorating . One caregiver from India reflected on her 6 - year - old boy with cerebral palsy and noted how “ because of lack of physiotherapy his walking , his postures , they are not in that good shape right now . ” Similarly , other caregivers worried that disruptions to healthcare were affecting their child’s development and resulting in the loss of previously attained milestones . Another partici - pant described her and her husband’s worsened health and functioning : Participant : In the last two years , “cô vít cô veo” [ COVID - 19 pandemic ] has prevented us [ the par - ticipant and her husband who also live with a physi - cal disability ] from going to a hospital . Even its hurt to die , we dare not to go to a hospital . Well , and now we’re like “lá mùa thu” [ autumn leaves which are yellow and almost shed ] , maybe gone soon . My groin joint is more painful four or five times than before [ the COVID - 19 pandemic ] because I can’t go to a hospital and can’t walk around . My husband’s arms and legs are weaker and weaker . [ 59 - year - old woman with a physical disability from Viet Nam ] Feeling left behind Exclusions and challenges in accessing services by people with disabilities during the pandemic had the effect of making people feel that they had been left behind . Some participants felt that while services commonly used by people without disabilities had been maintained during the pandemic , auxiliary services , including the therapies on which they rely to function optimally , had fallen to the wayside . One participant articulated this in terms of the government de - prioritising non - emergency services : [ Physiotherapy and similar therapies ] are very badly affected and government I think could not , but it was maybe not intentionally , not yet something that was overlooked but I think the times were such com - pelling and pressing that the government could not also look at that . [ 30 - year - old man with a vision impairment from India ] Others reported that they felt there had been a wide - spread disregard for people with disabilities needs in the design and delivery of COVID - 19 containment mea - sures and the COVID - 19 response more broadly . As one respondent concluded : …there was no measure / arrangement for persons with disabilities . [ 49 - year - old man with a physical disability from Ghana ] Enablers of healthcare access to the pandemic Local availability of services In general , there was a greater continuity of care for ser - vices delivered locally – for instance , where medications were dispensed from local pharmacies rather than hos - pitals . In one setting , doctors did home visits to people’s houses . Interviewer : But is the doctor regularly available during the COVID - 19 as well ? Participant : Yes . Interviewer : Does he come here regularly even dur - ing the COVID - 19 ? Participant : The doctor is available here all the time . Interviewer : Okay . So , you didn’t face any trouble even in the middle of the COVID - 19 ( pandemic ) , right ? Participant : Right . [ 55 - year - old man with multiple impairments from Bangladesh ] Telemedicine and home - based care A few participants , mainly in Bangladesh and India , reported the use of telemedicine to overcome access bar - riers to in - person services . The main users were children with disabilities who had been previously receiving ser - vices in schools and were connected to online support by their school ( although not all children with school - based services were connected to online health services ) . For example , a caregiver noted that her son was receiving online physiotherapy , where a therapist would provide a demonstration of what they should do with him in the week that followed . However , she noted that the phys - iotherapy time slots available clashed with his schooling and that she did not have the equipment or training to deliver services of the same quality as a professional . Participant : Like we used to go to vision therapy weekly five days and then again physio for three days , and occupational two days . So , it has com - pletely moved to online now and , the timing is also Page 8 of 12 Hunt et al . International Journal for Equity in Health ( 2023 ) 22 : 172 not [ great ] … because school is also going online… And the things the therapist has , like some toys , or some things which is required to do a therapy , that is not present at our home . All the things , we can’t get , Ok ? For there is somewhat compromise in the qual - ity . Ok ? [ Caregiver of an 8 - year - old boy with cerebral palsy from India ] Still , telemedicine and home - based care were not widely used in any setting . Even when available , other barriers prevented uptake . For example , in Bangladesh , barriers to access included low awareness of the availability of ser - vices as well as lack of access to required technology ( e . g . , internet / data , computer / smartphone ) . Role of OPDs / NGOs Many participants had ties to OPDs and NGOs working on disability due to the means of recruitment . Partici - pants frequently noted that OPDs and NGOs had been helpful to them during the pandemic , for example pro - viding financial support or food packages . There were also accounts , from participants , of receiving special allowances due to their medical needs , allowances which could allow them to meet healthcare costs . For instance , the Turkish Red Crescent runs a programme for refu - gees called Kizilaykart which is a cash - based humanitar - ian relief scheme which participants described receiving assistance from : Participant : Red crescent card , yes . We have the red crescent card… . Interviewer : And did this change in some way , Aunt ? Increase or decrease ? Participant : Yes , it increased . They increased it . So , we used to get 125 , then it became 155 and now for the situations – for medical cases . Like now my dif - ficult health situation , yes now it is 250 per person . [ 52 - year - old woman with a hearing impairment from Türkiye ] In other settings , participants described OPDs providing food packages . Participants also noted that OPDs were well - placed to identify and distribute support to people with disabilities and that they often filled roles that gov - ernments had not . For example , a 56 - year - old man with a vision impairment in Ghana noted that OPDs were important implementers “ because the Blind they know where the Blind people are , and the physical knows where they are , and it comes . ” Discussion This research found that people with disabilities in six countries - representing a diverse geographic spread , with different health systems and COVID - 19 responses - all experienced additional difficulties accessing health - care during the pandemic . Key barriers to accessing healthcare during the pandemic included changes in availability of services due to systems restructuring , dif - ficulty affording care due to the economic impacts of the pandemic , fear of contracting coronavirus , and a lack of human support to enable care - seeking . These barriers ultimately led to decreased utilisation of services which , in turn , negatively impacted their health and wellbeing . However , we also found that certain factors , including active and engaged OPDs / NGOs played a role in reduc - ing some of the impact of pandemic - related healthcare access barriers . Concerns over disruptions in accessing healthcare amongst people with disabilities were raised widely at the start of the pandemic [ 27 , 32 , 33 ] . This research and other studies highlight that these concerns were well - founded . For children , for example , school closures led to the loss of essential therapeutic and rehabilitation services deliv - ered through schools in many countries including the UK [ 34 ] , Italy [ 35 ] , and India [ 36 ] . Caregivers have reported a very negative impact of the loss of services and sup - ports , and many have felt ‘left on their own to meet com - plex educational , sensory - related , medical and social care needs’ of young people with disabilities [ 34 ] . A French survey among 1000 caregivers of children with disabilities found that the pandemic had led to drastic reductions in children’s engagement in healthcare and therapies [ 37 ] . In the US , 80 % of children with behavioural and mental health needs rely on school - based services for therapy [ 38 ] . As such , school closures have meant a far - reaching loss of critical health resources for children with dis - abilities . In order for health disparities between children with and without disabilities not to worsen , it is impera - tive that public health planning in the future takes these circumstances into account and recognise the role con - tinuity of education and services delivered through schools play in continuity of care for young people with disabilities . For adults , disruptions were similarly dam - aging . A recent review by McBride - Henry [ 39 ] and col - leagues notes that people with disabilities struggled to access healthcare services during the pandemic , resulting in feelings of ‘invisibility’ and poor mental health . These authors also highlight that people with disabilities with compounding vulnerabilities ( such as ethnic minorities , or those of low socioeconomic status ) were at the most risk of experiencing disruptions in healthcare access [ 39 ] . In the present work , rising costs and reduced ability to pay were also factors affecting healthcare access , which was found in some other studies , including in Japan [ 40 ] . Page 9 of 12 Hunt et al . International Journal for Equity in Health ( 2023 ) 22 : 172 Affordability of healthcare for people with disabilities has been a widespread challenge even before COVID - 19 . However , COVID - 19 and the emerging cost of liv - ing crisis have now exacerbated these challenges . People with and without disabilities were affected by job and earnings losses during the pandemic , however people with disabilities appear disproportionately affected . For example , people with disabilities are overrepresented in informal employment [ 41 ] , which is often not covered by employment protections and is heavily reliant on cus - tomer interactions that were restricted during periods of lockdowns and business closures . In a survey of the three largest cities in Viet Nam , people with disabilities were three times more likely to report having lost their job during the pandemic and 20 % more likely to report their household income had decreased compared to peo - ple without disabilities [ 42 ] . People with disabilities also already faced a heightened risk of poverty [ 43 ] , mean - ing many had less of a safety net to withstand short - term shocks such as the income loss during restrictions or ris - ing costs due to inflation . There is also some evidence that inflation has disproportionately affected healthcare , including medications and assistive devices [ 44 , 45 ] . For example , in Türkiye , inflation was 80 . 21 % in August 2022 , and one of the most affected costs were medicine [ 46 ] . This fits a global pattern : in the Maldives , for instance , 8 % for assistive products and 9 % for medicines in the first quarter of 2022 , compared to an overall national inflation rate of 0 . 6 % [ 47 ] . Fear of infection was also a barrier to seeking care , par - ticularly in settings that had high COVID - 19 caseloads . This fear appears well - founded for many , given evidence that some people with disabilities overall are at higher risk of COVID - 19 infection and of negative health out - comes , including death [ 48 – 50 ] . Older adults , people with learning disabilities , and people with certain under - lying chronic conditions are at particularly heightened risk . Finally , disruptions to informal support also impacted health and access to health services . Personal assistance and human support are often delivered through informal networks of family or friends or community members , particularly in settings that lack formal social care ser - vices . These informal care networks appeared disrupted during the pandemic , due to regulations on social dis - tancing and universal difficulties experienced by many members of the community . As early as March 2020 , commentators were already warning of the possible implications which measures such as physical distancing or self - isolation might have on the provision of human support for people with disabilities who rely on assis - tance for medical and personal care [ 51 ] . These authors and others [ 52 , 53 ] called for mitigation strategies to allow care workers and family members to continue to safely support people with disabilities . However , this study indicates that gaps still remained in the provision of personal assistance , which had wide ranging impacts on people with disabilities’ health , participation , and well - being . Our study also revealed that the cumulative effect of these barriers meant that people stayed out of care , and that their well - being and health deteriorated during the pandemic . People with disabilities reported worsening health during the pandemic resulting from loss of disabil - ity - related and routine healthcare secondary to increased financial strain and pandemic - related barriers to access - ing services . It also reinforced perceptions that the needs and concerns of people with disabilities were not ade - quately considered by governments . This perception is in line with findings from a recent scoping review of key learning points emerging from the COVID - 19 literature [ 54 ] , which found that public - health policies and strate - gies during the pandemic have often been made without an awareness and involvement of people with disabilities , their family , or carers . It is also important to note that participants high - lighted that certain factor played a role in minimising the impact of pandemic - related healthcare access bar - riers . These included locally available and accessible services , telemedicine interventions and home - based care , social support , and the role of OPDs / NGOs in sup - porting people with disabilities . Whilst informal social networks were often disrupted and the vast majority of participants experienced isolation , those who had increased social support found that the community sup - port helped to maintain their resilience , wellbeing , and access to services . Additionally , local service delivery appeared protective of people with disabilities’ health . While participants expressed fear of seeking services at crowded public facilities , they also noted the relative ease with which they could adhere to medication regimens and treatment protocols when they were locally avail - able outside of hospital settings , including through com - munity - based pharmacies or clinics , or through mobile healthcare workers . Telemedicine was not widely used by study participants ; however , other studies have shown that it holds promise in improving access to rehabilitation and other health services for people with disabilities even after it is no longer a pandemic - related necessity [ 55 – 57 ] . Complementary interventions - and evaluations of these interventions - are needed to support widespread uptake of telemedicine , such as by providing people with disabil - ities with required technology and training to use it . Our study feeds into the emerging evidence on the positive role played by OPDs in the pandemic , includ - ing in advocating for a more inclusive policy response from governments , and in providing practical support to people with disabilities [ 58 ] . Indeed , advocacy briefs , Page 10 of 12 Hunt et al . International Journal for Equity in Health ( 2023 ) 22 : 172 policy notes , and other documentation released at vari - ous stages during the pandemic by civil society organisa - tions have noted the significant role played by OPDs in terms of planning , programming , and advocating for peo - ple with disabilities in the context of the pandemic and possibly exclusionary governmental responses to it [ 59 – 61 ] . A rapid assessment of the effects of the COVID - 19 pandemic on OPDs in Bangladesh , Nigeria and Zimba - bwe reported that OPDs played a critical role responding to gaps in provision of key services due to non - inclusive planning [ 60 ] . However , the same study noted that OPDs experienced significant reductions to funding and opera - tional capacity during the pandemic . These constraints , coupled with the fact that provision of healthcare ser - vices is often outside of the purview of many OPDs’ stan - dard operations , meant that the role played by OPDs in bridging the gap between need to healthcare , and ser - vices , while important , was somewhat limited . However , the role which these organisations can play in linking people with disabilities to services , advocating for inclu - sion , and providing other forms of assistance to people with disabilities to enable healthcare - seeking , should be capitalised on and further invested in for emergency response planning going forward . This said , the reach of OPDs can be limited in some settings : for example , in a study that included survey data from nine countries , women , older adults , people with intellectual and com - munication impairments and people living in poverty and in rural settings were less likely to be affiliated with an OPD [ 62 ] . As such , alternative ways to enable access to care for people with disabilities are needed , to ensure that the most marginalised are reached during crises . Limitations This study has several limitations that should be consid - ered when interpreting the results . The first is that par - ticipants were mainly recruited through OPDs . OPDs , while extremely valuable networks for people with dis - abilities , are not necessarily representative of all people with disabilities in a setting [ 63 ] , and so our sample may be biased in systematic ways which reflect the differences between people who are , and are not , part of OPD net - works . It is also worth reflecting on how remote data col - lection impacted on the study . In most settings , remote data collection was used , meaning that people with dis - abilities were interviewed via telephone or videoconfer - ence . This meant that interviewers did not have access to some of the non - verbal cues which form an impor - tant part of interpersonal communication in in - person interactions , and this may have limited the depth of par - ticipants’ accounts in some instances . Further , relying on these forms of communication excluded people without access to the required technology . This is an important limitation as in some of the sites , rates of cell phone and computer access were low . Next , while accommodations were made as extensively as possible to ensure that peo - ple with disabilities were able to engage in the research , remote interviewing was particularly difficult for people with intellectual disabilities and communication impair - ments to utilise . This may have resulted in interviews with people with specific impairment types lacking depth compared to interviews with others . Finally , participants from Türkiye were all Syrian refugees for whom there are many NGOs providing targeted services . As such , find - ings should not be generalized the host community in Türkiye . Conclusion and directions for future research In most countries , there are no longer wide - ranging restrictions such as there were during the start of the pandemic . However , the aftershocks of the pandemic are still being felt , including in a burgeoning cost of living cri - sis [ 64 ] . Findings from studies such as those presented in this paper foreground a need for more research on strat - egies which allow people with disabilities to maintain access to needed services in the event of shocks , includ - ing future pandemics , climate , or humanitarian crises . In the wake of crises , there is often a call to ‘build back better’ - to learn from mistakes made and uti - lise the opportunities of a recovering healthcare system to improve services moving forward . The experiences of adults and children with disabilities in the context of COVID - 19 were marked by a range of unintentional exclusions and profound challenges accessing health services . If this clarion call to move forward with better , stronger , more responsive healthcare systems is to be answered , disability inclusion must be centred . Further research is required to trial interventions that can sup - port access of people with disabilities to required health services , including during times of crisis .
