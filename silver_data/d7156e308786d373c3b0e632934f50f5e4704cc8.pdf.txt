Palladin is a key cytoskeletal ABP whose normal function is to enable cell motility during development of tissues and organs of the embryo and in wound healing , but palladin is also responsible for regulating the ability of cancer cells to become invasive and metastatic . The membrane phosphoinositide phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) is a well known precursor for intracellular signaling , as well as a bonafide regulator of actin cytoskeleton re - organization . Our results show that two palladin domains ( Ig3 and Ig34 ) interact with the head group of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 with moderate affinity ( apparent K d = 17  M ) . Interactions with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 decrease the actin polymerizing activity of Palld - Ig3 . Further , NMR titration and docking studies show that residues K38 and K51 , present on the  sheet C and D , form salt bridges with the head group of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Moreover , charge neutralization at lysine 38 in the Palld - Ig3 domain severely limits the actin polymerizing and bundling activity of Palld - Ig3 . Our results provide biochemical proof that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 functions as a moderator of palladin activity and have also identified residues directly involved in the crosslinking activity of palladin .

PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is concentrated on the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane and accounts for less than 1 % of the total cellular pool of lipids [ 4 , 5 ] . In particular , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 plays an important role in actin cytoskeleton remodeling by directly interacting with and controlling subcellular localization of several actin binding proteins both spatially and temporally . For instance , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 promotes actin polymerization near the cell membrane by activating the actin nucleating and branching protein Arp2 / 3 complex via activation of N - WASP [ 6 ] and / or blocking the barbed - end capping activity of gelsolin [ 7 , 8 ] . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 also downregulates the activity of filamin and  - actinin and thereby decreases crosslinking of F - actin [ 9 , 10 ] . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 can also upregulate adhesion by inducing conformational changes in otherwise autoinhibited actin crosslinking proteins vinculin and talin [ 11 ] . Moreover , reduced cellular concentrations of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 result in the loss of cytoskeleton adhesion from cell membranes [ 12 ] . In general , the phosphoinositol head group mediates the interaction of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 with actin binding proteins , which is facilitated by electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged lipid head group and positively charged basic amino acids of the protein . However , in some cases the acyl chain of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 also facilitates this interaction with proteins [ 13 ] . Moreover , some actin binding proteins are indiscriminate in recognizing other phosphoinositides [ PI , PI ( 4 ) P , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ] . For example , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is capable of inhibiting the actin depolymerization activity of cofilin proteins in chicken and yeast , yet cofilin can likewise bind to PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 with relatively high affinity [ 13 , 14 ] . These diverse actions highlight the broad scope of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 activities in re - organizing the actin cytoskeleton . A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Phosphoinositide regulation of palladin 5 Palladin , a cytoskeletal actin binding protein , is widely expressed in muscle and non - muscle cells of vertebrates [ 15 ] . It has been functionally linked to the regulation of actin dynamics in normal embryonic development [ 16 ] , wound healing [ 17 , 18 ] and in invasive cancers [ 19 , 20 ] . Suppression of palladin expression results in the loss of stress fibers in fibroblasts cells [ 21 ] , decrease in the amount of filamentous actin [ 22 ] , defects in cell motility through reduced expression of contractile proteins [ 23 ] and loss of cytoskeletal organization . Conversely , overexpression of palladin in cultured cells increases the number and size of actin bundles [ 24 ] . Palladin is multi - domain scaffolding protein that also interacts directly with actin and crosslinks actin filaments [ 25 , 26 ] . Its scaffolding activity regulates actin dynamics via interactions with other actin binding and crosslinking proteins , such as ENA / VASP [ 27 ] , profilin [ 28 ] ,  - actinin [ 29 ] , Lasp - 1 [ 24 ] , and Ezrin [ 15 ] . Moreover , palladin interacts with signaling intermediates ( Src , SPIN - 90 and Abl / Arg kinase binding protein ( ArgBP2 ) ) that are associated with cytoskeletal reorganization [ 30 , 31 ] . The largest isoform of palladin ( isoform # 1 , M . W . ~ 200 kDa ) contains five immunoglobulin ( Ig ) domains : two amino terminal Ig domains ( Ig1 , Ig2 ) , followed by two polyproline rich regions and three C - terminal Ig domains ( Ig3 - Ig5 ) [ 32 , 33 ] . The Ig3 domain of palladin ( Palld - Ig3 ) has been shown to be both necessary and sufficient for both actin binding and crosslinking [ 25 , 26 , 34 ] . Despite the fact that the Ig4 domain and the linker between the Ig3 and Ig4 domains of palladin do not interact directly with actin , their addition increases actin binding and crosslinking activity significantly over that of the Ig3 domain alone [ 35 ] . Two lysine patches ( K15 / 18 and K51 ) on the surface of Palld - Ig3 have been implicated directly in its actin binding activity and it was suggested initially that these sites are also involved in its actin crosslinking activity [ 26 ] . Vattepu et al . ( 2015 ) have shown that actin A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Phosphoinositide regulation of palladin 6 crosslinking is the result of actin induced homodimerization of the Palld - Ig3 domain [ 35 ] , however the residues of Palld - Ig3 involved in homodimerization have not yet been identified . Our lab has recently shown that palladin can increase the rate of actin polymerization and also alters the organization of the resulting filaments [ 34 ] . Moreover , removal of the actin binding domain ( Palld - Ig3 ) results in the relocation of palladin to the nucleus [ 26 ] , suggesting that direct binding with actin has major implications for palladin’s role in cytoskeletal reorganization . Palladin also binds numerous cellular components other than F - actin , including multiple other actin - binding proteins , signaling intermediates , and transcription factors . Many of these binding partners regulate actin assembly ; therefore palladin resides at the center of a complex network to organize actin architecture . Therefore , it is crucial to understand the mechanisms through which the interactions in this network are regulated . Despite its well - established role in normal and invasive cell motility , regulation of palladin remains unexplored . Here , we have determined the functional regulation of palladin by anionic membrane phospholipids . We show that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 directly interacts with the actin binding domain of palladin ( Palld - Ig3 ) . The Palld - Ig3 interaction with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 appears to be electrostatic in nature , which also drives weaker interactions with PI , PI ( 4 ) P and Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 . Functionally , binding of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to Palld - Ig3 decreases its crosslinking activity and de novo actin filament assembly without significantly affecting actin binding . We have also identified the potential PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 interacting residues on the Palld - Ig3 domain . Interestingly , these interactions involve two lysine residues that do not have any significant effect on actin binding and lie on the face opposite one of the known actin binding sites . While mutation of these sites did not affect the actin binding activity ; the actin crosslinking activity and the rate of actin polymerization by A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Phosphoinositide regulation of palladin 7 Palld - Ig3 are both significantly decreased . Together , these results suggest that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is a potent regulator of palladin that interferes with actin crosslinking . Results Palld - Ig3 / Ig34 domains interact with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 enriched liposomes . As a preliminary experiment to determine the interaction of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 with palladin domains ( Palld - Ig3 , 4 , or 34 ) , we used the well - established liposome co - sedimentation assay [ 36 - 38 ] . In liposome co - sedimentation assays the amount of protein bound to liposomes was examined by using a constant concentration of Palld - Ig3 / 4 / 34 ( 10  M ) while varying the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentration ( 5 - 20 % ) in POPC vesicles ( 95 - 80 % ) . We observed significant co - pelleting of both Palld - Ig3 and Ig34 with increasing concentrations of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in POPC vesicles ( Fig . 1A , B ) . Although Palld - Ig4 showed some increase in sedimentation at higher PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentrations ( 15 - 20 % ) , the pelleted amount was significantly lower than Palld - Ig3 or Ig34 . Moreover , Palld - Ig34 showed significantly more co - sedimentation ( P < 0 . 0001 ) than Palld - Ig3 ( P < 0 . 0014 ) at all PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentrations and nearly all of the Palld - Ig34 pelleted at higher concentrations of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 15 - 20 % ) . Co - sedimentation of these individual palladin domains with POPC only vesicles produced minimum sedimentation of proteins in comparison to POPC : PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 vesicles , however co - sedimentation of Palld - Ig34 is greater than that for Palld - Ig3 or Ig4 with POPC vesicles . Importantly , co - sedimentation of palladin domains increased significantly with increasing concentrations of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the vesicles . Electrostatic interaction mediates PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 interaction with Palld - Ig3 / 34 . The next set of experiments were carried out to determine whether interactions between Palld - Ig3 and Ig34 with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 are dependent on the charge of the head group of anionic phosphatidylinositols ( PtdIns ) and whether other anionic membrane phospholipids have any propensity to interact with A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Phosphoinositide regulation of palladin 8 Palld - Ig3 and Ig34 . Vesicle co - sedimentation assays were repeated with vesicles prepared by mixing POPC with 15 % PI , PI ( 4 ) P , or PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . These phospholipids ( PtdIns ) differ in their subcellular distribution as well as the charge on their head group . PI , PI ( 4 ) P , and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 carry net charges of - 1 , - 2 , and - 3 , respectively [ 39 ] . Although some phospholipid binding proteins can discriminate between different phosphoinositides ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 ) in in vitro binding assays , the cellular concentration and membrane distribution of these phosphoinositides ensures in vivo binding specificity . As the most abundant phosphorylated phsophoinositide , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 represents ~ 1 – 2 % of the total pool of cellular phospholipids and is distributed asymmetrically to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane [ 4 ] . Yet , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , which is also present in the inner leaflet of plasma membrane , has a concentration that is hundred - fold lower than that of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( at 2 - 5 % of total phosphoinositde pool ) . While PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 carries a net negative charges similar to that of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , it is localized almost entirely to the late endosomes and comprises only < 0 . 05 % of total phosphoinositides in mammalian cells [ 40 ] . We observed significant co - sedimentation of Palld - Ig3 and Ig34 with these vesicles ; however , the amount of pelleted protein increased with the order of PI < PI ( 4 ) P < PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Fig . 1C , D ) . This suggests that phospholipid binding by Palld - Ig3 and Ig34 increases with increasing charge on the head group and is indicative of an electrostatically - driven interaction between the negatively charged head group of PtdIns and the positively charged amino acids of Palld - Ig3 . The interaction of vesicles of different lipid compositions with Palld - Ig3 was further investigated by monitoring changes in the NMR signal upon titration with increasing amounts of phospholipids [ 41 , 42 ] . As shown in Supplemental Fig . 6 , small signal losses were observed upon titration of Palld - Ig3 with liposomes containing PC , however PC - liposomes containing increasing amounts of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 resulted in significantly increased signal attenuation , indicating A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Phosphoinositide regulation of palladin 9 that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 enhances the affinity of palladin for liposomes . A more moderate effect was measured for PI ( 4 ) P - containing liposomes and PS promoted even less effective binding at similar concentrations . This result clearly indicates that the perturbation increased with increasing amounts of negatively charged lipids . Quenching of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Intrinsic tryptophan quenching assays were performed next to further characterize the interaction of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 with palladin domains . Tryptophan quenching was previously employed to measure PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding to several other actin binding proteins [ 43 - 45 ] . The fact that most immunoglobulin domains have a single tryptophan in the hydrophobic core , including the Ig3 and Ig4 domains of palladin [ 46 ] , facilitates the use of tryptophan quenching studies . In this assay , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 was serially added to the protein solution and the fluorescence signal was recorded . We did not detect any red or blue shift in the position of emission maxima wavelength , which remained essentially around 330 nm for all three domains ; suggesting that the addition of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 does not affect the structural integrity of the palladin domains . Similar to the results obtained in our vesicle co - sedimentation assay , maximum quenching of tryptophan fluorescence was observed for both the Palld - Ig3 and Ig34 domains upon addition of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Fig . 2A , C ) ; whereas no significant change in the intensity was observed for Palld - Ig4 ( Fig . 2D ) . We analyzed fluorescence quenching data as a function of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentration to determine the binding affinity of Palld - Ig3 and Ig34 with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 by fitting the respective values in equation 1 which yielded a dissociation constant ( K d ) of 17 . 3 ± 2 . 1 and 13 . 5± 4  M , respectively ( Fig . 2B ) . Titration of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in Palld - Ig34 resulted in fluorescence quenching akin to the titration of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in Palld - Ig3 , albeit with higher standard deviation ( S . D . ) . Yet , the overall trend remained similar in all three repetitions for Palld - Ig34 . A similar assay was carried out to ascertain the effect of POPC on palladin A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Phosphoinositide regulation of palladin 10 domains and we observed minimal tryptophan quenching for all three proteins in comparison to the results obtained for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 titration ( supplementary Fig . 1 ) , however we did detect some minor differences in the extent of quenching . Here the most significant quenching occurred for Palld - Ig34 followed by Ig3 and Ig4 and this trend mirrored the results we obtained in the POPC vesicle co - sedimentation assay . POPC , although zwitterionic , displays only a slightly negatively charged behavior in salt solutions , which has been attributed to the binding of anion to the trimethylammonium group of the POPC lipid [ 47 , 48 ] . This propensity to carry a net negative charge by POPC lipids is a likely explanation for the minimal binding to palladin domains that leads to some measurable co - sedimentation and tryptophan quenching in our assays . Together these results suggest that while Palld - Ig4 has very minor affinity for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , the primary PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding activity resides in the actin binding domain of palladin ( Palld - Ig3 ) . Binding of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 decreases actin crosslinking and polymerizing activity of palladin . Dixon et al . ( 2008 ) have shown that both Palld - Ig3 and Ig34 can bind to filamentous actin and that the actin binding activity of palladin resides mainly within the Ig3 domain [ 25 ] . Although the Ig4 domain and the intervening linker between the Ig3 and Ig4 domains of palladin have not shown any direct interaction with actin [ 25 ] , the actin binding and crosslinking activity of the tandem Ig34 domain are both significantly greater than the isolated Palld - Ig3 domain [ 25 , 26 ] . Recognizing that the Ig3 domain is the minimal structural unit of palladin that is sufficient for actin binding and crosslinking , we wanted to know the functional significance of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 interaction with this domain . First we performed conventional actin binding cosedimentation assay with filamentous actin and Palld - Ig3 in the presence of varying concentrations of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . This assay revealed that addition of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 has minimal effect on the actin binding activity of Palld - Ig3 ( supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Therefore we next investigated the effect of A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Phosphoinositide regulation of palladin 11 PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 on the actin crosslinking activity of Palld - Ig3 . We chose non - polymerizing conditions because the actin crosslinkng activity of Palld - Ig3 is significantly higher as a result of co - polymerization with actin as opposed to the addition of Palld - Ig3 to pre - polymerized actin filaments [ 34 ] . We observed a significant decrease in actin crosslinking ( 15 - 40 % with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 as opposed to 60 % without PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) in dose dependent manner upon addition of varying concentration of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 mixed Palld - Ig3 with G - actin ( Fig . 3A , B ) . The fact that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 reduces the actin crosslinking activity of Palld - Ig3 , without significantly altering its actin binding activity , suggests that the actin binding and crosslinking sites on Palld - Ig3 are structurally independent . Recently we have shown that the Palld - Ig3 domain also promotes de novo actin nucleation and polymerization [ 34 ] . Therefore we next sought to determine whether PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding has any effect on palladin’s actin nucleation and polymerization activity . Therefore , we first used an actin co - sedimentation assay with the modification that we initiate the reaction with monomeric actin ( G - actin ) , instead of filamentous actin ( F - actin ) , and strictly avoid any polymerization inducing cations ( K + and Mg 2 + ) . Moreover , we have added 1 mM EGTA to the G - actin and G - buffer just prior to the experiment to chelate any calcium , which could lead to aggregation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Most of the G - actin is polymerized and is found in high speed pellets in the control sample ( without PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) for both Ig3 and Ig34 ( Fig . 3C , first lanes ) ; however we detected an increasing amount of monomeric actin in the supernatant fraction upon co - incubation of monomeric actin with complex of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 50 - 150  M ) and Palld - Ig3 or Ig34 in G - buffer conditions . Likewise , less palladin co - pelleted with actin with increasing concentrations of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Fig . 3C , D ) . As much as a fifty percent decrease in the actin polymerization was observed at the highest concentration of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Fig . 3D ) . Moreover , chelation of calcium A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Phosphoinositide regulation of palladin 12 from the G - actin did not alter the actin nucleation and polymerization activity of palladin , which is in agreement with mechanism proposed by Gurung et al . ( 2016 ) whereby binding of Palld - Ig3 to actin transforms globular actin to nucleation and polymerization competent form through charge neutralization or conformational change [ 34 ] . Next we monitored the effect of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 on the rate of F - actin assembly as promoted by Palld - Ig3 / Ig34 in a bulk solution assay that takes advantage of the fact that the fluorescence intensity of pyrenyl - G - actin increases 7 - 10 fold upon polymerization , which is directly proportional to the amount of G - actin incorporated into F - actin [ 49 ] . We measured the complete time course of actin polymerization , using 5 µM G - actin and 20  M Palld - Ig3 or 10  M Ig34 in the presence of varying concentrations of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 0 - 100 µM ) under polymerizing and non - polymerizing conditions . We observed a decrease in actin polymerization with increasing concentrations of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in both Palld - Ig3 and Ig34 in F - buffer conditions ( Fig . 4A , B ) . Moreover , a lag phase that is characteristic of a slow nucleation step in actin polymerization was observed at higher concentrations of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . A similar trend for actin polymerization by Palld - Ig3 in the presence of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 was observed in non - polymerizing conditions ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Similar experiments with Palld - Ig34 in non - polymerizing conditions could not be monitored accurately due to the extremely fast polymerization rate , which could not be resolved well at initial time points . Importantly , we observed a significant decrease in the rate of actin polymerization promoted by Palld - Ig3 or Ig34 with increasing concentrations of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Moreover , the rate of actin polymerization was found to be two - fold higher for Palld - Ig34 ( 15 nM / sec ) than for Palld - Ig3 ( 7 nM / sec ) at saturating concentrations of these proteins ( Fig . 4C ) . This difference likely reflects the fact that Palld - Ig34 has a greater apparent actin - binding A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Phosphoinositide regulation of palladin 13 affinity ( K d ~ 9  M ) , which is closer to that of full - length palladin ( K d ~ 2 . 1  M ) , than Ig3 ( K d ~ 60  M ) [ 25 ] . Mapping of inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate induced chemical shift change . To define the nature and specific binding site for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 on Palld - Ig3 , we have collected a pair of 1 H - 15 N HSQC spectra of Palld - Ig3 ( 0 . 2 mM ) with or without saturating concentrations ( 1 mM ) of Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( i . e . , head group of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) . Since , we were interested in the specific interaction of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 head group without any interference by the acyl tail of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , we consciously choose to collect NMR spectra with Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 . However , we did observe significant chemical shift perturbations ( CSPs > 0 . 04 ppm ) for a cluster of residues on the Palld - Ig3 domain : K38 , I39 , W41 , F42 , Q47 , S49 , K51 , and I57 ( Fig . 5 ) . In addition , we detected few residues ( F9 , T64 , H68 , and N86 ) that were spatially separated from the first cluster of residues but display significant chemical shift changes upon titration of Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( Fig . 5B ) . Mapping these signifiantly perturbed residues onto the soultion structure of Palld - Ig3 ( PDB Id : 2LQR ) reveals that the most perturbed residues lie at the interface between  strands C and D as well as the loop between these strands ( Fig . 6A and B ) . Interestingly , these residues are located on the face opposite to that of the known actin bindng site ( K15 and K18 ) [ 26 ] . The only tryptophan ( W41 ) present in the Palld - Ig3 domain , which is partially buried in the hydrophobic core , shows strong chemical shift deviations in the presence of Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 . This strong CSP substantiates the previously observed tryptophan quenching results and indicates that W41 resides near the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding site . We infer from the CSP result that two surface - exposed lysines ( 38 and 51 ) might play an important role in Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 interactions . Decreased actin binding and crosslinking activity has been associated with mutation of one of these lysine residues ( K51A ) [ 26 ] . However , a similar mutation K38A in Palld - Ig3 did not affect actin binding in previous A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Phosphoinositide regulation of palladin 14 actin co - sedimentation assays [ 26 ] . The exposure of strong CSPs for both K38 and K51 upon Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 titration suggests that electrostatics are important determinants for palladin’s interactions with Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , reminiscent of palladin’s interactions with actin . Molecular docking of Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 onto the Palld - Ig3 structure . The polar head group of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) was used for docking studies aimed at identifying the sites of interaction between Palld - Ig3 and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . The docking procedure was initiated with the NMR structure of Palld - Ig3 domain ( PDB : 2LQR ) [ 26 ] and Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( PDB : 1N4K ) as starting coordinates using the guru interface of HADDOCK2 . 2 [ 50 ] . Rigid body docking with flexible side chains of Palld - Ig3 and Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 resulted in a total of 198 water refined conformers in 3 clusters . The cluster with lowest HADDOCK score ( - 114 . 6 ± - 3 . 2 kCal / mol ) contained 175 conformers with RMSD of 0 . 5 from lowest energy structure . Examination of the best representative conformer from the cluster suggests that the Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 molecule binds at the concave side formed between  strand C and D via basic residues from the  strand C and the following loop ( K38 and K51 ) . The Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 molecule interacts with Palld - Ig3 via a salt bridge between side chains of K38 , Q47 , S49 , K51 , R59 and inositol phosphates ( Fig . 6C , D ) . Lysine muatation of K38 / 51A decrease the actin crosslinking substantially . A previous study revealed that alanine substitutions of lysine 38 in Palld - Ig3 had only minor or no effect on actin binding , while mutation of lysine 51 resulted in a 10 % decrease in binding in comparison to Palld - Ig3 WT [ 26 ] . Identification of these residues as the likely lipid binding site from docking studies prompted us to revisit the actin binding assay with a Palld - Ig3 - K38 / 51A double mutant protein . We observed that ~ 30 % of WT Palld - Ig3 co - sediments with F - actin at and above saturating concentrations , which was similar to the previously published data [ 26 ] . However actin binding for Palld - Ig3 K38 / 51A mutant only reached 20 - 22 % at saturating concentrations in A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Phosphoinositide regulation of palladin 15 similar reaction conditions as for WT palld - Ig3 ( Fig . 7A , supplementary Fig . 4A ) . While this decrease in actin binding for the K38 / 51A mutant is minor , it may be significant in terms of highlighting a potential secondary actin binding site that could facilitate crosslinking of F - actin . In the previous study by Beck et al . ( 2014 ) , an actin crosslinking model was proposed in which two basic patches are involved in actin binding : namely one involving lysine15 and 18 and a second located at lysine 51 on the opposite face of Palld - Ig3 [ 26 ] . Both lysines 38 and 51 are located on the face opposite that of lysines 15 and 18 ; thus , our results suggest that K51 is joined by K38 to form a cluster of lysine residues that are involved in actin binding and / or bundling . Therefore we next examined the actin crosslinking activity of the K38 / 51A Palld - Ig3 mutant . We chose non - polymerizing conditions for this assay similar to that of Palld - Ig3 actin crosslinking in the presence of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . In this co - polymerization bundling assay , crosslinking by Palld - Ig3 - K38 / 51A was dramatically decreased to approximately 5 - 15 % as opposed to 70 % for wild type Palld - Ig3 ( Fig . 7B , supplementary Fig 4B ) . Moreover , a significant fraction of actin remained monomeric when incubated with mutant Palld - Ig3 , suggesting this mutation also affects the polymerizing activity . Therefore , we have identified lysine residues ( K38 and K51 ) in the actin binding domain of palldin that affect actin crosslinking to a much greater degree than actin binding . This finding will be useful in teasing apart the two separate roles for palladin in actin binding versus crosslinking . To monitor the effect of these mutations on the rate of actin polymerization , we repeated the actin polymerization kinetic assay with Palld - Ig3 - K38 / 51A ( Supplementary Fig . 5B ) . In contrast to our previous experiments invovling PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 : Palld - Ig3 complexes , here we used a priming solution ( 0 . 1 mM MgCl 2 and 1 mM EGTA ) to convert to Mg - actin just prior to each assay . The K38 / 51A mutant took twice as long as wildtype Palld - Ig3 to reach the plateau A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Phosphoinositide regulation of palladin 16 ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Moreover , polymerization of actin exhibited a lag phase even at higher concentrations of Palld - Ig3 K38 / 51A , suggesting a minimal effect on the rate of actin polymerization . Discussion Previous studies have demonstrated the role of palladin as a cytoskeletal scaffold and an actin crosslinking protein . Recently , our group has shown that Palld - Ig3 is capable of de novo actin nucleation by promoting the G  G * transition of monomeric actin leading to an increased rate of actin polymerization as well as stabilization of actin filaments [ 34 ] . This previous work has provided causative links between overexpression of palladin and altered cytoskeletal dynamics that lead to the formation of invadopodia required for metastasis of cancer cells [ 20 , 34 , 51 ] . However , the mechanism for regulating the actin binding activity of palladin is not well understood . Several studies of actin binding proteins have illustrated that surface exposed positively charged residues facilitate interactions with actin , which has also been found true in the case of palladin [ 26 ] . Previous studies have also shown that some acidic phosphoinositides , such as PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , can mask or expose actin binding sites and thereby modulate the actin dynamics essential to cell surface events [ 4 ] . In this study , we report that membrane phosphoinositide PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 interacts with the actin binding domain of palladin with moderate affinity and also diminishes the actin polymerization activity of palladin . Moreover , we have also identified two lysine residues ( K38 and K51 ) in the actin binding domain of palladin that do not significantly affect actin binding , but notably reduce the actin crosslinking activity . Our data show that the Ig3 and Ig34 domains of palladin bind to acidic phospholipids under physiological conditions ; whereas , the isolated Ig4 domain did not show significant co - sedimentation in similar experimental conditions . Interestingly , while Palld - Ig4 binding to A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Phosphoinositide regulation of palladin 17 POPC : PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 liposomes was minimal , a much higher degree of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 co - sedimentation with the tandem Palld - Ig34 was observed than that for Palld - Ig3 alone . This enhancement is similar to the previous reports for actin binding of Palld - Ig3 as compared to Ig34 [ 25 ] . While the isolated domain of Palld - Ig4 does not bind directly to actin , it does enhance the actin binding and crosslinking activity of Palld - Ig3 when present as the tandem domain ( Palld - Ig34 ) [ 25 ] . Although the mechanism governing this phenomenon has not been fully uncovered , a previous study by Vattepu et al . ( 2014 ) suggested that actin binding stabilizes palladin homodimers , which in turn enhances actin binding and crosslinking [ 35 ] . A similar mechanism for the enhanced co - sedimentation of Palld - Ig34 with POPC : PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 cannot be resolved at this point ; however , it is quite likely that the weak interaction of Palld - Ig4 with POPC : PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 or Palld - Ig34 with POPC contributes to the enhanced co - sedimentation . As part of our analysis we determined the dissociation constant , K d , for Palld - Ig3 and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 using a tryptophan - quenching assay . We determined that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 interacts with Palld - Ig3 with moderate affinity ( K d ~ 17  M ) ; which is similar to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding affinities reported for gelsolin ( 40  M ) , CapG ( 32  M ) and vilin ( 39 . 4  ) from similar fluorescence quenching assays [ 43 , 52 ] . While the isolated Ig3 domain of palladin displays similar binding affinities for both actin ( 60  M ) and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( ~ 17  M ) , the binding affinities of full - length palladin and Palld - Ig34 for actin are both stronger ( K d ~ 2  M and ~ 9  M , respectively ) that represent the binding affinity of palladin for actin [ 25 ] . Both the non - homogeneous distribution and discrete clustering of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the cell membrane affect local concentration of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in vivo [ 53 ] , which in turn , can modulate the interaction of lipid - binding proteins . Therefore the competing interaction between palladin and actin may not preclude its interaction with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in dense regions of this phospholipid in the cell membrane environment . Although there is no direct A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Phosphoinositide regulation of palladin 18 evidence for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 interactions with palladin in vivo , plenty of indirect evidence supports this interaction . In general , it is well established that palladin localizes at the cell membrane and is involved in communication with various forms of external stimuli . Palladin co - localizes with bundles of actin filaments at dorsal stress fibers that are distributed throughout the cytoplasm , but palladin is also found at sites that are associated with the plasma membrane where cells form connections to the extracellular matrix or cell - cell association , such as membrane ruffles , podosomes and invadapodia [ 53 ] . Recent work from von Nandelstadh et al . ( 2014 ) has demonstrated that the C - terminal domain of palladin ( Ig3 - 5 ) interacts with the intracellular domain of membrane - type 1 matrix metalloproteinase ( MT1 - MMP ) at extracellular matrix ( ECM ) adhesion sites and promotes ECM degradation [ 54 ] . Moreover , it has been shown that palladin maintains the structural integrity of lamellipodia and focal adhesions [ 22 ] . Palladin also cooperates with lipoma partner protein ( LPP ) at focal adhesions [ 55 ] . This growing list of membrane associated functions and partners suggests that palladin belongs to the class of proteins that connects adhesion molecules in the cell membrane to the cytoskeleton and indicates an important functional role for phospholipid binding by palladin . While previous work has established that the Ig3 domain of palladin promotes actin , crosslinking and polymerization , here we show that interactions with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 affect both activities . On the one hand , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 decreases actin crosslinking and polymerization by palladin . This is in contrast to the observation that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 did not affect actin binding by Ig3 in polymerizing conditions ( F - buffer ) . This dichotomy can be explained by highlighting the fact that actin binding requires only one binding site , however crosslinking and polymerization likely involve multiple interactions and / or conformational changes in palladin , such as actin - induced dimerization [ 35 ] . Our previous work indicated that Palld - Ig3 stimulates actin nucleation and A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Phosphoinositide regulation of palladin 19 polymerization and that crosslinking of actin filaments that occurs during polymerization is far greater than bundling of pre - formed actin filaments [ 34 ] . Here , we observe an obvious decrease in actin crosslinking by palladin upon binding to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , which correlates with decreases in actin polymerization . Moreover , our current study clearly indicates that Palld - Ig34 is at least four times more efficient than Palld - Ig3 in stimulating de novo actin nucleation and polymerization . This claim is based on the fact that the rate of polymerization increased by a factor of two for half the concentration of Palld - Ig34 , as compared to Ig3 ( Fig . 4C ) . The steady - state plateau in fluorescence signal intensity reached by the tandem Ig34 domain is more than double that for the single domain and reaches this concentration of polymerized actin more rapidly and at a lower concentration of Palld - Ig34 in similar experimental conditions . This combination of factors suggests that Palld - Ig34 is much more effective than Palld - Ig3 in promoting and stabilizing actin polymerization and is therefore a better model for in vitro studies where the highly unstable , full - length palladin protein cannot be used . Our results suggest that electrostatic interactions between PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and Palld - Ig3 or Ig34 are critical . Using NMR , we have identified a cluster of residues ( K38 , I39 , W41 , F42 , Q47 , S49 , K51 , and I57 ) on the Ig3 domain of palladin that represent the putative PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 binding sites . Moreover , docking of Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 onto the structure of Palld - Ig3 substantiates the involvement of residues K38 and K51 in this interaction . Correlation of tryptophan fluorescence quenching upon addition of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and the significant CSP observed for W41 in Palld - Ig3 : Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 suggests that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 share a binding region on Palld - Ig3 . A similar phosphoinositide binding motif has been identified in a group of actin binding proteins that consists of a series of positively charged amino acids in the following arrangement : R / K - ( X ) 4 - [ R / K ] - X - [ RR / KK ] [ 52 , 56 ] . Sequence comparison of Palld - Ig3 with this phosphoinositide A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Phosphoinositide regulation of palladin 20 binding motif reveals that at least three charged residues are conserved in the lipid binding region of Palld - Ig3 , between residues K38 to K46 ( Fig . 8 ) . In fact , palladin contains lysines that are positioned much like the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding motif in cortexillin , where every fifth position after lysine was occupied by another lysine . This binding motif has also been suggested to be involved in PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding for cortexillin [ 57 ] . Two lysine residues ( K43 and K46 ) of the putative PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding motif are located quite far from K38 and K51 in the three dimensional structure ( on the loop between  strand C and D ) and do not show significant CSP in the presence of Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 . However , considering the flexibility of unstructured region ( K43 - D53 ) , the role of K43 and K46 cannot be ruled out in case of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 interactions . Interestingly , this predicted PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding motif of Palld - Ig3 does not belong to the previously identified actin binding basic patch ( K15 , K18 ) [ 26 ] . The Palld - Ig3 domain has several lysine residues that are clustered on one face of the molecule ( K13 , K15 , K18 ) , while another set of lysines ( K36 , K38 , K43 , K46 , K51 ) can be found on the opposite face of this  - sandwich structure [ 26 ] . Only three of these residues ( K15 , 18 and 51 ) have been shown to affect actin binding upon mutating to a neutral residue [ 26 ] . Interestingly , with the exception of K51 , we did not observe any CSPs that were associated with residues involved in actin binding ( K15 , K18 ) . The previous study by Vattepu et al . , ( 2014 ) reveals that Palld - Ig3 dimerization enhances actin crosslinking [ 35 ] . However the residues of Palld - Ig3 involved in homodimerization have not been identified . We extend this finding with our results here that suggest that the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - interacting cluster of Palld - Ig3 ( K38 - K51 ) may be involved in this dimerization surface , which would in turn would affect actin crosslinking . To test this hypothesis , we generated K38 / 51A mutation in Palld - Ig3 . We observed that this mutation significantly reduced the in vitro actin crosslinking and polymerizing activity of Palld - Ig3 , while only modestly lowering actin binding . A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Phosphoinositide regulation of palladin 21 Our results are the first to indicate that two different regions in Palld - Ig3 are responsible for actin binding and bundling . Moreover , we also reveal that decreased bundling activity also affects de novo actin polymerization by palladin , perhaps by interfering with the stable palladin dimer . Our results also indicate a role for PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 regulation of palladin’s activity via alteration of its actin crosslinking activity . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 interferes with actin binding in many other actin binding proteins , such as villin [ 52 ] , vinculin [ 58 ] , cofilin [ 13 ] , by competing with actin for overlapping binding sites . However , a similar mechanism for palladin regulation is not likely because this would result in the localization of palladin in the cytoplasm in the absence of actin , which is contrary to the established result of nuclear localization of palladin when the actin binding site is interrupted by mutagenesis [ 26 ] . This suggests that it is more plausible for the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to regulate palladin’s activity via regulation of crosslinking activity rather than actin binding and our data supports this mode of regulation . Materials and methods Expression and purification of palladin domains , palladin mutant ( K38 / 51A ) and actin . The M . musculus Ig3 , Ig4 and Ig34 domains of palladin were subcloned into the pTBSG ( or pTBMalE ) expression vector as described [ 35 ] . All constructs were transformed into BL21 ( λDE3 ) E . coli cells ( New England Biolabs ; Ipswich , MA ) for protein expression . E . coli cultures were grown at 37 °C until the OD 600 reached 0 . 7 and further grown overnight at 18 °C in ZYM - 5052 auto - induction media as described [ 59 ] . Cell cultures were pelleted down and resuspended into lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 ; 300 mM NaCl ; 10 mM imidazole ) followed by sonication and clearing of cell lysate by centrifugation . Supernatant was loaded onto a pre - equilibrated Ni - NTA column and protein was purified according to the manufacturer’s guidelines ( ThermoFisher Scientific ; Waltham , MA ) . The N - terminal histidine tag was cleaved by TEV protease and A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Phosphoinositide regulation of palladin 22 further purified as previously reported [ 25 ] . Additionally , the MBP fusion protein was removed from Palld - Ig34 construct by loading TEV digested Palld - Ig34 on amylose resin and purified as manufacturer’s guidelines ( New England Biolabs ; Ipswich , MA ) . All three palladin domains were finally dialyzed in HBS buffer ( 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 ; 50 mM NaCl ; 1 mM DTT ) . A double lysine point mutation ( K38 / 51A ) in the Palld - Ig3 domain was cloned in pQlinkH vector , and mutations were verified by sequencing . Palld - Ig3 K38 / 51A protein was purified as described for wildtype protein . Uniform 15 N - isotopically labeled Palld - Ig3 was prepared by growing the E . coli cells in N - 5052 auto - induction minimal media containing 10 mM 15 NH 4 Cl ( Sigma - Isotec , St . Louis , MO ) as the sole nitrogen source [ 59 ] . Further , Palld - Ig3 was purified as described for unlabeled protein and buffer exchanged into NMR buffer ( 20 mM HEPES , pH 6 . 9 ; 50 mM NaCl ; 1 mM DTT ; 0 . 05 % NaN 3 ; 10 % D 2 O ) . Actin was purified from rabbit muscle acetone powder ( Pel - Freez Biologicals ; Rogers , AR ) using the method described by Spudich and Watt [ 60 ] and gel - filtered on 16 / 60 Sephacryl TM S - 200 column ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) . Purified monomeric actin was stored at 4 °C in G - buffer ( 5 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 ; 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 ; 0 . 2 mM DTT ; 0 . 2 mM ATP ; 0 . 02 % NaN 3 ) and used within 1 - 2 weeks . Pyrene - labeled actin was prepared by the reaction of N - ( 1 - pyrenyl ) iodoacetamide ( Sigma - Aldrich ) with gel - filtered G - actin as described previously [ 49 ] . Preparation of phospholipid vesicles and vesicle co - sedimentation assay . 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( POPC ) , L - α - phosphatidylinositol ( PI , 18 : 2 ) , and L - α - phosphatidylinositol - 4 - phosphate ( PI ( 4 ) P , 18 : 4 ) ( 1 mg / mL ) dissolved in chloroform : methanol or chloroform were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids , Inc . ( Alabaster , AL , USA ) . Phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PI ( 45 ) P 2 , diC8 ) in lyophilized form was purchased from A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Phosphoinositide regulation of palladin 23 Echelon Biosciences , Inc . ( Salt Lake City , UT ) . A liposome co - sedimentation assay was carried out as described previously [ 36 ] to determine whether Palld - Ig3 / Ig4 / Ig34 interacts with POPC and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . In brief , lipid vesicles of POPC with different ratios of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 5 - 20 % ) were made by mixing various quantities of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 12 . 5 - 50 µg ) and POPC ( 237 . 5 - 200 µg ) . Lipid mixtures were then vacuum dried overnight and re - suspended in HBS buffer before extensive sonication in a water bath for 15 minutes with highest power ( model G112SPIT ; Laboratory supplies , Inc . Hicksville , NY ) . Care was taken to keep the pH of lipid vesicles identical to the protein solutions . Similarly , lipid vesicles of POPC and PI / PI ( 4 ) P ( 15 % ) were prepared . Protein stock solutions of Palld - Ig3 / Ig4 / Ig34 were centrifuged at 100K x g for 50 min ( Beckman TL - 100 ultracentrifuge ; Beckman - Coulter ) to remove any protein aggregates . Liposomes of POPC and POPC / PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 were mixed 10 µM Palld - Ig3 / Ig4 / Ig34 and incubated for 30 minutes before centrifugation at 100K x g for 40 min . The supernatants were removed , the pellet was resuspended in 100 µl of 0 . 1 % SDS buffer ( 25 mM Tris , pH 8 . 3 ; 25 mM glycine ; and 0 . 1 % SDS ) and the proteins in pellet and supernatant were separated using 10 % tricine - SDS - PAGE gels . The amount of protein pelleted in each fraction was quantified by using ImageJ software [ 61 ] . At least 3 data sets were averaged and standard deviation calculated . Further statistical analysis was done by one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) test on GraphPad Prism software version 6 for Windows , ( GraphPad Software , San Diego , California ) . Differences between values were considered significant if P < 0 . 05 . Tryptophan fluorescence quenching assay . Tryptophan fluorescence spectra of Palld - Ig3 / Ig4 / Ig34 were collected on a Cary - Eclipse spectrofluorometer ( Varian , Agilent Technologies , Inc . ) . POPC vesicles ( 4 mM stock ) were prepared for this experiment as described above , while 4 mM PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 micelle stock was prepared by resuspending PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 powder in A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Phosphoinositide regulation of palladin 24 HBS buffer followed by sonication in water bath for 5 minutes . Palld - Ig3 ( 10 µM ) , Palld - Ig34 ( 10 µM ) or Palld - Ig4 ( 20 µM ) in HBS buffer were placed in a 1 - cm square quartz cuvette with a sample volume of 200 µL at constant temperature of 25 ºC . POPC vesicle or PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 micelles at final concentrations ranging from 2 . 5 µM to 70 µM were used in increments of 0 . 25 or 0 . 5 µL . Tryptophan fluorescence spectra were collected twice after 5 minutes of incubation at excitation wavelength of 295 nm and slit width of 5 nm for excitation and emission . The total volume of vesicle / micelles added did not exceed 2 % of the initial protein solution at lower concentrations of POPC / PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . The decrease in fluorescence emission of Palld - Ig3 at 329 nm was plotted as a function of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentration , and the change was assumed to be proportional to the concentration of protein - PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 complex . The apparent dissociation constant , K d , for Palld - Ig3 and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 was calculated using the equation 1 as described by Ward [ 62 ] and Lin [ 43 ] , where ΔF is the fluorescence quenching at a given PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentration , ΔF max is the total fluorescence quenching of the protein saturated with ligand , and [ lipid T ] is the concentration of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Data were fitted and ΔF max was determined for Palld - Ig3 and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding by nonlinear regression analysis in GraphPad Prism version 7 . Actin crosslinking , co - polymerization and pyrene fluorescence assay . Actin co - sedimentation assays were carried out to quantitate the effect of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 on actin crosslinking by Palld - Ig3 that occurs during co - polymerization . Quantities of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 0 - 150 µM ) were incubated with 20 µM Palld - Ig3 for 30 min . , that was further incubated with Ca - G - actin in non - polymerizing conditions ( G - buffer ) . The reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 hour and then centrifuged at 5 , 000 x g for 10 min . To pellet all actin filaments , the supernatant was then centrifuged at 100K x g for 50 min . ( Beckman TL - 100 ultracentrifuge ) . Supernatant and pellet A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Phosphoinositide regulation of palladin 25 fractions were separated . All the fractions were resuspended in 100 µl of 0 . 1 % SDS buffer that were further separated on 15 % SDS - PAGE gels . The amount of Palld - Ig3 present in each fraction was quantified by using ImageJ software [ 61 ] . The actin cosedimentation assay was adapted to determine the effect of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding on the actin polymerizing activity of Palld - Ig3 / Ig34 . In these assays , Palld - Ig3 / Ig34 ( 10 µM ) was incubated with various amounts PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 0 - 150 µM ) in HBS buffer with 1 mM EGTA for 30 min , thereafter G - actin ( 10 µM ) was added in non - polymerizing conditions ( G - buffer ) and further incubated for 1 hour . To quantify polymerized actin induced by PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - Palld - Ig3 / Ig34 , the reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 100K x g for 30 min . The supernatants were removed carefully and the pellets were resuspended in 100 µl of 0 . 1 % SDS buffer ( 25 mM Tris , pH 8 . 3 ; 25 mM glycine ; and 0 . 1 % SDS ) . Pellet and supernatant fractions were further analyzed on 15 % SDS - PAGE gels . The amount of actin polymerized in each sample was quantified by using ImageJ software [ 61 ] . To ascertain the effect of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 on the rate of actin polymerization by Palld - Ig3 , the change in fluorescence intensity of 5 % pyrenyl - actin was measured , which is 7 - 10 times greater than the fluorescence intensity of monomeric actin as described [ 49 ] . Palld - Ig3 ( 20 µM ) was mixed with various concentrations of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 20 - 100 µM ) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature . Pyrenyl - G - actin and unlabeled G - actin were mixed together to make a 20 µM , 5 % pyrene labeled G - actin stock . Right before the experiment , 5 µM of this stock was incubated for 2 minutes upon addition of 1 mM EGTA . Polymerization was then initiated by addition of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - Palld - Ig3 / 34 mixture with 25 mM KCl ( polymerizing condition ) to 5 µM G - actin . Pyrene fluorescence of actin was measured with excitation at 365 nm and emission at 385 nm in fluorescence spectrophotometer ( PTI , Edison , New Jersey ) . We added equal amounts of storage A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Phosphoinositide regulation of palladin 26 buffer in the entire reaction sample to insure that no contributions from Palld - Ig3 storage buffer affected polymerization . Baseline fluorescence was subtracted from the raw data . To determine the rate of overall polymerization raw data were first normalized by subtracting the baseline fluoroscence and then dividing the fluorescence values by the steady - state plateau fluoroscence . Then the overall polymerization rate of each polymerization curve was determined by plotting the slope of linear region of curve and converting relative fluoroscence units / s into nM actin / s . We can assume that at equillibrium , the total amount of polymer is equal to the total concentration of actin minus the critical concentration , as Palld - Ig3 does not alter the critical concentration [ 34 ] . Similar experiments were done to determine the effect of Palld - Ig3 K38 / 51A mutation on actin polymerization . In brief , 5 µM pyrenyl - Ca - G - actin ( 5 % labeled ) was converted to Mg - G - actin by incubating in priming solution ( 1 mM EGTA and 0 . 1 mM MgCl 2 ) for 2 min . Palld - Ig3 K38 / 51A ( 0 - 20 µM ) was added with 25 mM KCl to collect the fluorescence signal with instrument setting identical to previous . Positive controls of wild type Palld - Ig3 / Ig34 were also recorded for each experimental condition . All fluorescence values were corrected for baseline fluorescence signal . NMR chemical shift mapping of Palld - Ig3 - Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 complex . NMR spectra were collected on a Bruker Avance 800 MHz NMR instrument equipped with TCI cryoprobe and Z - axis pulse field gradients at the University of Kansas Bio - NMR Lab . For the NMR experiments , the Palld - Ig3 solution was concentrated to 0 . 6 mM in NMR buffer . The PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 head group , Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 in lyophilized form was purchased from Echelon Biosciences , Inc . and 1 mg was dissolved in NMR buffer to make a 2 mM stock solution . 2D 15 N - 1 H HSQC experiments were recorded for 0 . 2 mM Palld - Ig3 without and with Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( 1 mM ) . Spectra were processed A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Phosphoinositide regulation of palladin 27 using NMRPipe [ 63 ] and analyzed by CARA [ 64 ] . Chemical shift perturbations ( CSPs ) were analyzed using CARA version 1 . 8 . 4 and combined chemical shift perturbations Δδ TOTAL of 1 H N and 15 N nuclei were weighted to normalize the larger chemical shift range of 15 N following the method as described by Williams et al . , ( 2014 ) [ 65 ] : The cutoff of significance was measured by the mean value of the chemical shift difference ( δ mean ) for the 84 chosen residues was 22 . 9 ppb , and the standard deviation ( δ std ) was 19 . 5 ppb . The residues whose chemical shift changed by more than 41 . 4 ppb ( δ mean + δ std ) or 0 . 04 ppm [ 66 ] . Molecular Docking . To validate the Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 binding site onto the Palld - Ig3 domain , we performed docking utilizing guru interface of High Ambiguity Driven protein - protein DOCKing ( HADDOCK2 . 2 ) [ 50 ] with 5000 structures for rigid body docking . Palld - Ig3 coordinates used for the docking were extracted from the NMR structure of Palld - Ig3 ( PDB entry : 2LQR ) [ 26 ] . The ligand coordinates used for molecular docking were extracted from X - ray crystal structure of the inositol 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate receptor binding core in complex with Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( PDB entry : 1N4K ) . HADDOCK2 . 2 docking of Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 onto Palld - Ig3 resulted in a total of 198 conformers clustered in three groups that represented 99 . 0 % of the water - refined models . All conformers were clusters according to their HADDOCK score , which is defined as a weighted sum of different energies ( 1 * E VDW + 0 . 2E elec + 0 . 1E AIR + 1 * E desolv ) . The results of the docking were visualized and analyzed by UCSF chimera [ 67 ] , WeNMR [ 68 ] and LIGPlOTv . 4 . 5 . 3 [ 69 ] . Actin cosedimentation assay and crosslinking assay of Palld - Ig3 K38 / 51A mutant . Actin co - sedimentation assays were carried out to quantitate the F - actin binding of Palld - Ig3 K38 / 51A A CC EP T E D M A N U S CR I P T ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Phosphoinositide regulation of palladin 28 mutant . In this assay , G - actin ( 10 µM ) was polymerized into F - actin by addition of polymerizing buffer ( 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 ; 100 mM KCl ; 2 mM MgCl 2 ) for 40 min . and subsequently incubated for 1 hr with 10 - 40 µM Palld - Ig3K38 / 51A . This mixture of F - actin and protein was centrifugation at 100K x g for 50 min ( Beckman TL - 100 ultracentrifuge ) . To isolate the co - pelleted protein with F - actin , the supernatant was removed carefully and the pellet was resuspended in 100 µl of 0 . 1 % SDS buffer and further separated on 15 % SDS - PAGE gels . The amount of Palld - Ig3K38 / 51A present in each fraction was quantified by using ImageJ software [ 61 ] , while Palld - Ig3 WT was used as positive control . To quantitate the effect of Palld - Ig3K38 / 51A on actin crosslinking that occurs during co - polymerization , 10 µM Ca - G - actin was incubated with various amount of Palld - Ig3 ( 0 - 40 µM ) in non - polymerizing conditions ( G - buffer ) . Reaction conditions and sample analysis were done by following protocol similar to the crosslinking of actin by Palld - Ig3 in presence of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 .
