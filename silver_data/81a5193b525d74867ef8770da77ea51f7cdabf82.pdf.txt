Photoactivation and biochemical approaches show that lysosomally tar - geted integrins are not degraded but are retrogradely transported and recycled to the plasma membrane at the back of invading cells . This requires CLIC3 , a protein upregulated in Rab25 - expressing cells and tumors , which colocalizes with active a 5 b 1 in late endosomes / lysosomes . CLIC3 is necessary for release of the cell rear during migration on 3D matrices and is required for invasion and mainte - nance of active Src signaling in organotypic microen - vironments . CLIC3 expression predicts lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis in operable cases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) . The identiﬁcation of CLIC3 as a regulator of a recycling pathway and as an independent prognostic indicator in PDAC highlights the importance of active integrin trafﬁcking as a potential drive to cancer progression in vivo . INTRODUCTION Metastasizing cells need to invade the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) that surrounds tissues and tumors , and must survive and grow within these microenvironments ( Sahai , 2005 ) . As they invade , tumor cells form dynamic interactions with the ECM that not only provide traction force for forward motion and ECM remod - eling but also promote cell growth and survival ( Kumar and Weaver , 2009 ) . Both the motility and the growth and survival of tumor cells are controlled by integrins : transmembrane proteins that interact extracellularly with ECM proteins , such as ﬁbro - nectin and collagen , and intracellularly with the cytoskeleton and the cell’s signaling and vesicular transport machinery ( Caswell et al . , 2009 ; Hynes , 2002 ) . Although the ECM protein , ﬁbronectin , is not normally found in adult tissue , it is a very abundant component of the tumor - associated ECM ( Zetter , 1993 ) , and the cell’s major ﬁbronectin - binding integrin ( a 5 b 1 ) is key to the survival ( Lee and Juliano , 2000 ; O’Brien et al . , 1996 ; Zhang et al . , 1995 ) and migration ( Caswell et al . , 2007 , 2008 ; Muller et al . , 2009 ) of tumor cells . a 5 b 1 is continuously endocytosed and then returned , or recycled , to the plasma membrane via Rab11 - and Arf6 - depen - dent pathways ( Powelka et al . , 2004 ; Roberts et al . , 2001 ; Tayeb et al . , 2005 ) . Membrane trafﬁcking pathways mediating a 5 b 1 recycling inﬂuence its capacity to promote cancer invasion . Expression of p53 mutants or inhibition of a v b 3 integrin can drive recruitment of the Rab11 effector , Rab - coupling protein ( RCP ) , to the cytotail of b 1 integrin , which then enables RCP to asso - ciate with the EGF receptor 1 ( EGFR1 ) . a 5 b 1 and EGFR1 are then coordinately recycled to the plasma membrane in a way that potentiates EGFR1 signaling to Akt , a kinase that promotes invasion ( Caswell et al . , 2008 ; Muller et al . , 2009 ) , cell growth , and survival . Another Rab11 family member , Rab25 , is associated with aggressive cancers ( Caswell et al . , 2007 ; Cheng et al . , 2004 ) , and drives invasion by binding to a 5 b 1 to control its recruitment to the tips of invasive projections ( Caswell et al . , 2007 ) . There is also evidence that Rab25 can suppress tumor progression . Nam et al . ( 2010 ) have shown that loss of Rab25 promotes intestinal neoplasia , and low levels of Rab25 are associated with human colorectal cancer . Rao and coworkers ( Cheng et al . , 2006 , 2010 ) have found that Rab25 expression is reduced in many breast tumors , and its loss in estrogen - receptor - negative breast cancer cell lines promotes aggression . These discrepancies led us to further investigate the mechanisms by which Rab25 inﬂuences invasive behavior in vitro and the progression of cancer in vivo . We show that Rab25 directs conformationally active a 5 b 1 integrin to the lysosome . Lysosomally routed a 5 b 1 is not degraded but is rapidly recycled to the plasma mem - brane via a pathway requiring the Chloride Intracellular Channel Protein 3 ( CLIC3 ) . CLIC3 is required for cell migration and is Developmental Cell 22 , 131 – 145 , January 17 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . 131 Figure 1 .

Moreover , CLIC3 levels dictate metastasis and poor patient survival , thus high - lighting the importance of integrin trafﬁcking to cancer progres - sion in vivo . RESULTS CLIC3 Is Upregulated in a Rab25 and 3D Matrix - Dependent Fashion We plated A2780 cells stably expressing either Rab25 ( A2780 - Rab25 ) or a control vector ( A2780 - DNA3 ) onto plastic or cell - derived matrix ( CDM ) —a thick , pliable matrix composed mainly of ﬁbrillar collagen and ﬁbronectin that recapitulates aspects of the matrix found in connective tissues—and compared their mRNA proﬁles using Affymetrix arrays . We ranked gene expression changes primarily according to the less conservative step - up p value ( one that controls for false discovery rate ) and secondarily according to fold changes ( see Table S1 available online ) , and this revealed CLIC3 to be the most signiﬁcant Rab25 - upregulated gene when cells were plated onto CDM , but not following adherence to plastic surfaces ( Figure 1A ) . To conﬁrm CLIC3 induction , mRNA from A2780 - DNA3 and A2780 - Rab25 cells was analyzed by real - time quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) . CLIC3 mRNA was induced 6 - fold by Rab25 on plastic dishes , and this increased to > 20 - fold when cells were adherent to CDM ( Figure 1B ) . Moreover , CLIC3 mRNA expression in A2780 - Rab25 cells was reduced by siRNA of Rab25 ( but not Rab11 ) ( Figures 1B and 1C ) , indicating that altered regulation of CLIC3 levels was not due to clonal variation between the two A2780 lines but was Rab25 speciﬁc . We generated a highly speciﬁc polyclonal antibody that rec - ognized CLIC3 , but not CLIC1 and CLIC4 : the two CLIC family members most closely related to CLIC3 ( Figure 1D ) . Our anti - CLIC3 recognized a protein of the expected molecular weight ( 27 kDa ) that was abundant in lysates from A2780 - Rab25 cells but barely detectable in control cells ( Figure 1E ) . Moreover , CLIC3 protein levels were somewhat increased by plating A2780 - Rab25 cells on CDM ( Figure 1F ) , and this was opposed by knockdown of Rab25 ( Figure 1C ) . Conversely , siRNA of CLIC3 did not alter Rab25 levels ( Figure 1G ) . To evaluate the relationship between Rab25 and CLIC3 expression in tumor cells , we compared their mRNA and protein levels in a large cohort of pancreatic and ovarian tumors ( see Figure S1 for validation of Rab25 and CLIC3 antibodies ) . Rab25 and CLIC3 levels correlated with one another in both pancreatic and ovarian carcinoma ( Figure 1H ) . These data indi - cate that elevated Rab25 is associated with enhanced CLIC3 expression both in a cell culture model and human tumors . Rab25 - Dependent Sorting of Ligand - Engaged a 5 b 1 to CLIC3 - Positive Late Endosomes / Lysosomes In glass - attached A2780 - Rab25 cells , Cherry - CLIC3 was not present at early ( EEA1 ) or recycling ( Rab11 ) endosomes ( Figures S2A and S2B ) but colocalized with the late endosomal marker Rab7 ( Figure S2C ) , and was particularly coincident with LAMP1 , Sialin ( Figures 2A and 2B ) , and lysotracker ( Fig - ure S2D ) , which are well - established markers of late endo - somes / lysosomes . Many Rab25 - positive structures colocalized with Rab11a and internalized transferrin , particularly in the perinuclear region , consistent with previous observations that this GTPase is located at recycling endosomes ( Figure 2C ) ( Casanova et al . , 1999 ) . Nevertheless , many Rab25 - positive structures did not colocalize with Rab11a or internalized trans - ferrin but displayed marked coincidence with LAMP1 ( Fig - ure 2C ) and Rab7 ( data not shown ) , indicating that Rab25 was also present at late endosomes . Moreover , Rab11a did not colocalize with LAMP1 , indicating that late and recycling endosomes are morphologically distinct in these cells ( Fig - ure 2C ) . Examination of time - lapse movies indicated a relation - ship between Rab25 and CLIC3 - positive endosomes , such that the two structures appear frequently to contact one another and remain in close apposition for z 20 s at a time ( see arrows and inset in Figure 2D ; Movie S1 ) . We have quantiﬁed the number and duration of contact events occurring between Rab25 and CLIC3 structures , and compared these with those observed between the CLIC3 compartment and Rab11 recy - cling endosomes . Rab25 endosomes contact CLIC3 structures on average 1 . 8 ± 0 . 2 times / min / cell , and these events persist , on average , for 21 ± 2 . 4 s ( Figure 2D ) . By contrast , contact events between Rab11 endosomes and CLIC3 structures are fewer ( 0 . 9 ± 0 . 2 times / min / cell ) and persist for less time ( 9 ± 2 . 0 min ) . Taken together , these data indicate that Rab25 is localized not only to recycling endosomes but also to a late endosomal population that is distinct from Rab11 / transferrin endosomes . Furthermore , Rab25 - positive structures contact the CLIC3 compartment ( which is also late endosomal / lysosomal in nature ) signiﬁcantly more than do recycling endosomes . Fibronectin , the main ligand for a 5 b 1 , is known to be trans - ported to lysosomes following internalization ( Shi and Sottile , 2008 ) . Consistently , we found that ﬂuorescently labeled soluble ﬁbronectin accumulated in late endosomes / lysosomes to colocalize closely with CLIC3 ( Figures 2A , 2B , and S2C ) , sug - gesting that ligand - occupied a 5 b 1 may also be trafﬁcked toward lysosomes . Indeed , quantitative ﬂuorescence imaging indicated that addition of soluble ﬁbronectin to A2780 - Rab25 cells promoted delivery of a 5 b 1 to CLIC3 - positive late endo - somes / lysosomes ( Figure 2E ) . Conversely , in the absence of Rab25 , ﬁbronectin did not increase colocalization of a 5 b 1 with CLIC3 ( Figure 2E ) , indicating that Rab25 plays a role in di - recting ﬁbronectin - occupied a 5 b 1 heterodimers to the lyso - somal system . The Conformational Status of a 5 b 1 Dictates Its Late Endosomal / Lysosomal Sorting Binding of ﬁbronectin to integrins leads to structural reor - ganization such that they assume an active conformation ( G ) Levels of Rab25 protein in A2780 - Rab25 cells following CLIC3 suppression ( using siRNA ) were determined by western blotting .

Integrin activation can also be induced from within the cell by association of cytoplasmic proteins , such as talin , or by introduction of point mutations that weaken intermolecular interactions between the a - and b - integrin cyto - tails ( Hughes et al . , 1996 ) . Previous studies have shown that F1025A mutation in the a 5 integrin cytodomain leads to constitu - tive a 5 b 1 activation ( Webb et al . , 2007 ) . Using an antibody speciﬁc for the active conformation of b 1 ( 9EG7 ) , we found that addition of ﬁbronectin or expression of constitutively active a 5 ( CA a 5 ) increased the amount of immunoprecipitable active b 1 integrin ( Figure S3A ) . This was independent of Rab25 status , indicating that this GTPase does not inﬂuence ﬁbronectin’s ability to activate b 1 integrins . 9EG7 staining colocalized with Sialin in ﬁxed A2780 - Rab25 cells ( Figure S3B ) , indicating that active - conformation integrins can be sorted to late endosomes / lysosomes . Consistently , quantitative ﬂuorescence imaging indicated that GFP - tagged CA a 5 ( GFP - CA a 5 ) integrin was localized to CLIC3 - positive late endosomes / lysosomes ( Figure 2E ) even in the absence of added ﬁbronectin . Moreover , transport of GFP - CA a 5 to CLIC3 vesicles was not apparent in A2780 cells that did not express Rab25 ( Figure 2E ) . These data indicate that active - conformation a 5 b 1 hetero - dimers are routed to late endosomes / lysosomes where they co - localize with CLIC3 , and that Rab25 ( which is also located on elements of the late endosomal system ) is necessary for this sorting event . CLIC3 Controls a 5 b 1 Recycling from Late Endosomes / Lysosomes When surface - labeled a 5 b 1 was endocytosed in the absence of added ﬁbronectin , it returned to the plasma membrane with largely single order kinetics , and this was unaffected by knock - down of CLIC3 ( Figure 3A ) . However , following inclusion of ﬁbronectin during the internalization period , or expression of CA a 5—two situations under which transport of a 5 b 1 to late en - dosomes / lysosomes is promoted—the integrin recycled with altered kinetics ( Figures 3A – 3C ) . There was an initial , rapid component to a 5 b 1’s return to the plasma membrane that was reduced by knockdown of CLIC3 using two independent siRNA duplexes , or by addition of baﬁlomycin , a drug that opposes late endosome / lysosome acidiﬁcation ( Figures 3A – 3C ) . Moreover , the ability of CLIC3 knockdown to oppose recycling of CA a 5 b 1 was negated by expression of an siRNA - resistant ‘‘rescue’’ mutant of CLIC3 ( FLAG - CLIC3 ) , but not by a control vector ( pcDNA3 ) ( Figure 3C ) . We then performed trafﬁcking assays using the 9EG7 antibody so as to detect recycling only of active b 1 heterodimers . This revealed that active b 1 integrins were returned to the plasma membrane with kinetics that corresponded to the rapid , CLIC3 - dependent component of recycling ( Figures 3A – 3C ) . Moreover , recycling of active integrin was opposed by CLIC3 knockdown ( Figures 3A – 3C ) , and this was particularly apparent following expression of CA a 5 ( Figure 3C ) . Baﬁlomycin also suppressed recycling of the 9EG7 - positive integrins in a way that was mostly apparent at earlier time points ( Figure 3A ) . These data indicate that CLIC3 is required for recycling of lysosomally targeted a 5 b 1 and that the heterodimers can return to the plasma membrane in their active conformation . Visualization of Integrin Recycling from Late Endosomes / Lysosomes in Glass - Attached Cells To visualize integrin recycling from CLIC3 - positive late endo - somes / lysosomes in glass - attached A2780 cells , we used pho - toactivatable GFP - a 5 ( paGFP - a 5 ) . We expressed paGFP - a 5 together with Cherry - CLIC3 and incubated the cells with ﬁbro - nectin to promote transport of the integrin to late endosomes / lysosomes . Alternatively , to visualize recycling of integrins in the active conformation while obviating the need to include ﬁbronectin , we used a photoactivatable GFP version of CA a 5 ( paGFP - CA a 5 ) . We then aimed a 405 nm laser at a ‘‘single point’’ corresponding to a Cherry - CLIC3 - positive vesicle , and this led to photoactivation of late endosomally / lysosomally localized wild - type ( Figure 3D ; Movie S2 ) or constitutively active ( Fig - ure S4A ) integrin . Following this , ﬂuorescence was lost from the photoactivated vesicle , which was accompanied by increased ﬂuorescence at an adjacent region of the plasma membrane ( Figures 3D and S4A ; Movie S2 ) . Quantiﬁcation of movies indicated that both CA a 5 and the ﬁbronectin - engaged wild - type integrin recycled at rates that were indistinguishable ( Figure 3E ) . Consistent with results from biochemical assays , paGFP - a 5 remained within the CLIC3 compartment following photoactivation and did not recycle following baﬁlomycin addi - tion ( Figures 3D and 3E ; Movie S3 ) . While addressing the fate of active a 5 b 1 heterodimers following CLIC3 knockdown , we found it impossible to photoac - tivate integrin in late endosomes / lysosomes following CLIC3 knockdown , suggesting that it had been degraded . To address this , we surface labeled GFP - CA a 5 in A2780 - Rab25 cells and used a capture ELISA to record its degradation . Active a 5 b 1 was degraded slowly in control knockdown cells , and this was markedly increased following siRNA of CLIC3 ( Figure 3F ) . More - over , expression of an siRNA - resistant CLIC3 ‘‘rescue’’ construct protected CA a 5 from degradation in CLIC3 knock - down cells ( Figure 3F ) . Taken together , these biochemical and photoactivation - imaging data indicate that ‘‘active’’ conformation a 5 b 1 hetero - dimers that have been routed to CLIC3 - positive late endo - somes / lysosomes are not degraded , but rapidly recycled to the plasma membrane , via a mechanism that requires CLIC3 and lysosome acidiﬁcation . In the absence of CLIC3 , lysosomally routed a 5 b 1 heterodimers cannot return to the plasma membrane and are degraded . Activated a 5 b 1 Integrins Are Transported Retrogradely during Migration on CDM A2780 - Rab25 cells move on CDM by extending long pseudo - pods in the direction of migration ( Caswell et al . , 2007 ) . Fluores - cence imaging indicated that Rab25 colocalized closely with LAMP1 ( Figure S5A ) and Rab7 ( data not shown ) within the tip and shaft of these pseudopods . Moreover , there were frequent and persistent contact events between Rab25 ( but not Rab11 ) and CLIC3 - positive structures that were observable primarily in the pseudopod shaft ( see white arrows in Figures S5B and S5C ) . Furthermore , CLIC3 colocalized with LAMP1 ( data not shown ) and Sialin ( Figure S5D ) , and these late endoso - mal / lysosomal compartments moved bidirectionally within the pseudopod shaft , suggesting the possibility that they mediate transport of cargo to or from the cell front .

CLIC3 Is Required for Recycling of Activated a 5 b 1 Integrin ( A ) A2780 - Rab25 cells were either left untransfected or were transfected with nontargeting siRNA ( siRNA - NT ) or with siRNA targeting CLIC3 ( siRNA CLIC3 # 4 ) . They were then surface labeled with 0 . 2 mg / ml NHS - S - S - Biotin at 4 (cid:1) C , and internalization was then allowed to proceed for 30 min at 37 (cid:1) C in the presence or absence of 3 m g / ml FN , baﬁlomycin ( 100 nM ) , or vehicle control ( DMSO ) . Biotin remaining at the cell surface was removed by exposure to MesNa at 4 (cid:1) C , and the cells wereincubated forthe indicated times at37 (cid:1) C . Thequantityof biotinylated receptors remaining within thecells was determined by capture ELISA using microtiter wells coated with monoclonal antibodies recognizing a 5 or active b 1 ( 9EG7 ) . Values are mean ± SEM ( n = 3 independent experiments ) . ( B ) A2780 - Rab25 cells were transfected with nontargeting ( siRNA - NT ) or siRNA oligonucleotide targeting CLIC3 ( siRNA - CLIC3 # 4 ) , in conjunction with GFP - a 5 . Recycling assays were performed in the presence of ﬁbronectin ( 3 . 0 m g / ml ) as for ( A ) . Biotinylated integrins were detected by capture ELISA using antibodies recognizing GFP or active b 1 ( 9EG7 ) . Values are mean ± SEM ( n = 3 independent experiments ) . Developmental Cell CLIC3 , a 5 b 1 Recycling , and Cancer 136 Developmental Cell 22 , 131 – 145 , January 17 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . We photoactivated paGFP - a 5 within Rab25 vesicles near the pseudopod tip and , consistent with previous observations , paGFP - a 5 recycled preferentially at the cell front ( Figures 4A and 4B ; Movie S4 ) . By contrast , paGFP - CA a 5 did not recycle primarily at the pseudopod tip but was retrogradely trafﬁcked to the cell rear ( Figures 4C and 4E ; Movie S5 ) . Retrograde traf - ﬁcking of paGFP - CA a 5 was opposed by baﬁlomycin ( Figures 4D and 4E ; Movie S6 ) , which blocks recycling of active a 5 b 1 in glass - attached cells ( Figure 3 ) . Indeed , in the presence of baﬁlomycin , paGFP - CA a 5 did not efﬁciently recycle at the cell rear but appeared to move slowly from the photoactivated vesicle to more rearward late endosomes ( Figure 4D ) that were LAMP1 and CLIC3 positive ( Figure S4B ) . Further experi - ments indicated that paGFP - CA a 5 photoactivated within Cherry - CLIC3 vesicles toward the cell front did not recycle at the pseudopod tip but was destined for other intracellular compartments and the plasma membrane in the cell rear ( Figure S4C ) . Taken together , these data indicate that when cells migrate on CDM , wild - type a 5 b 1 is recycled at the cell front , whereas integ - rins locked in the active conformation are transported backward via the CLIC3 / lysosomal pathway and recycled at the rear . CLIC3 Is Required for Migration on CDM and for Invasion into 3D Microenvironments When CLIC3 knockdown A2780 - Rab25 cells were plated onto CDM , they moved , on average , more slowly than control cells , and this was rescued by re - expression of an siRNA - resistant form of CLIC3 ( Figure 5A ) . Moreover , pseudopods at the front of CLIC3 knockdown ( but not control ) cells became longer with increasing plating time on CDM ( Figures 5B and 5C ) . We noticed that CLIC3 knockdown cells tended to remain stationary for long periods , but following these pauses they moved quickly forward as the cell body was released ( Figure 5B ; Movie S7 ) . To quantify this , we deﬁned a cell that moved less than 3 m m within 90 min as one that was engaged in ‘‘pausing . ’’ CLIC3 knockdown or addition of baﬁlomycin markedly increased the duration and incidence of these pauses , and this was restored to control levels by re - expression of CLIC3 ( Figures 5C and 5D ) . Further - more , the limited pausing that was exhibited by control cells was reduced to almost negligible levels by addition of soluble ﬁbronectin or expression of CA a 5 integrin ( Figure 5C ) , indicating that CLIC3’s ability to transport active integrin contributes to the suppression of cellular pausing . To determine the effect of CLIC3 knockdown on cell move - ment during the period in which cells were moving , we calculated the frame - to - frame displacement of cells while they were not pausing , and we have termed this the ‘‘momentary velocity . ’’ Consistent with our observations that CLIC3 cells tend to ‘‘jump’’ forward following release of the cell body and rear ( Fig - ure 5B ; see arrow in Movie S7 ) , we found that momentary velocity was increased following CLIC3 knockdown or baﬁlomy - cin addition ( Figures 5C and 5D ) . These data indicate that CLIC3 is required to coordinate cell body translocation with pseudopod extension to enable pause - free cell migration . A2780 - Rab25 cells invade ﬁbronectin - supplemented Matrigel in an a 5 b 1 - dependent fashion ( Caswell et al . , 2007 ) . Suppres - sion of CLIC3 ( with four independent siRNA sequences , or a ‘‘SMARTPool’’ ) consistently reduced the penetration of A2780 - Rab25 cells into ﬁbronectin - supplemented Matrigel over a 48 hr period ( Figure 5E ) . Transient expression of GFP - Rab25 ( which is insufﬁcient to drive CLIC3 expression ) had limited capacity to invade ﬁbronectin - supplemented Matrigel ( Figure 5F ) ( Caswell et al . , 2007 ) . We therefore tested whether CLIC3 could collaborate with Rab25 to drive invasion when ex - pressed transiently . Indeed , A2780 cells transiently expressing both GFP - Rab25 and FLAG - CLIC3 displayed similar invasive - ness to the stable A2780 - Rab25 ( endogenously CLIC3 - express - ing ) cells ( Figure 5F ) . To determine whether CLIC3 inﬂuences the ability of tumor cells to thrive in 3D microenvironments over a more prolonged period , we generated A2780 - Rab25 lines that stably express small hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) duplexes to suppress CLIC3 levels ( Figure 6A ) . These CLIC3 knockdown lines had similar capacity to grow and survive on plastic surfaces as control knockdown cells ( Figure 6A ) . We then assessed growth and invasiveness of these cells in organotypic gels formed from acid - extracted rat tail collagen preconditioned with human dermal ﬁbroblasts that are thought to closely recapitulate a tumor stromal environ - ment ( Marsh et al . , 2008 ) . Control A2780 cells moved into orga - notypic matrices and survived in considerable numbers over a 14 day period ( Figure 6B ) . By contrast , CLIC3 knockdown clone # 1 cells invaded and survived in reduced numbers , and knockdown clone # 2 cells ( which displayed a much greater reduction of CLIC3 protein ) were undetectable following a 14 day incubation period ( Figure 6B ) . These data indicate that CLIC3 is required for movement of Rab25 - expressing A2780 cells into Matrigel , and also for their sustained growth ( C ) A2780 - Rab25 cells were transfected with GFP - CA - a 5 in conjunction with nontargeting ( siRNA - NT ) or siRNA oligonucleotides targeting CLIC3 ( siRNA - CLIC3 # 3 and # 4 ) , as indicated .

Activated integrins can alter cell - invasive behavior by recruit - ing focal adhesion kinase leading to activation and autophos - phorylation of Src on tyrosine 416 . Integrin - mediated Src activa - tion is required for tumor cell invasion ( Brunton and Frame , 2008 ) , and the use of phospho - speciﬁc antibodies to detect levels of phosphotyrosine 416 - Src is a robust way to determine integrin signaling in tissue sections . Active phospho - Src was clearly visible at the plasma membrane of A2780 - Rab25 cells both within and near the top of the organotypic plug ( Figure 6C ) . However , in CLIC3 knockdown cells levels of phospho - Src were signiﬁcantly reduced , as indicated by quantitative anal - ysis of anti - phospho - Src immunohistochemical signal ( brown pixels ) with respect to the hematoxylin stain ( blue pixels ) ( Fig - ure 6C ) . Importantly , the histoscore values for CLIC3 and phospho - Src were strongly correlated with one another in pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( Figure 6D ) , indicating the possi - bility that CLIC3 is associated with upregulated integrin sig - naling in vivo . CLIC3 Expression in Ovarian and Pancreatic Cancer Because we have found that CLIC3 acts to recycle integrins that have been targeted to late endosomes / lysosomes by the action of Rab25 , we wished to evaluate the expression of CLIC3 in cancers thought to be driven by Rab25 . High levels of Rab25 have been shown to correlate with poor prognosis and aggres - siveness of ovarian cancers ( Cheng et al . , 2004 ) , so we initially looked at CLIC3 in patient samples from this disease . We de - tected CLIC3 expression in various types of ovarian tumors including serous ( Figure 7A ) , endometrioid , clear cell , and mucinous carcinoma ( data not shown ) primarily in punctate cytoplasmic structures but also within the nucleus of some tumors . Ovarian tumors can be categorized into type I , which includes low - grade micropapillary serous carcinoma , mucinous , endometrioid , and clear cell carcinomas , and type II , which comprises high - grade serous carcinomas , malignant mixed mesodermal tumors , and undifferentiated carcinomas and is commonly highly invasive and much more likely to present with disseminated disease ( Vang et al . , 2009 ) . Histoscore analysis indicated that CLIC3 protein levels were higher in type II than in type I ovarian tumors ( Figure 7B ) , supporting a potential role for this protein in cancer invasion . Moreover , Rab25 levels were similarly elevated in type II tumors , further supporting the close relationship between this GTPase and CLIC3 ( Figure 7B ) . Given the histological and pathophysiological similarities between ovarian and pancreatic cancers ( Hruban et al . , 2007 ) , we analyzed CLIC3 expression in neoplastic lesions of the human pancreas . CLIC3 was undetectable in ductal and acinar tissues of normal human pancreas ( Figure 7C ) . Pancreatic cancers are thought to arise via precursor lesions called pan - creatic intraepithelial neoplasms ( PanINs ) ( Hruban et al . , 2000 ) . Examination of early PanINs revealed that CLIC3 expression was low within well - organized epithelia ( Figure 7C , green arrows ) , whereas dysplastic PanIN regions were more abundant in CLIC3 ( Figure 7C ; red arrows ) . CLIC3 was highly expressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) ( Figure 7C ) , being localized to cytoplasmic granules but also observable in the nucleus of some cancers with high CLIC3 levels . Moreover , CLIC3 expression was highly enriched in regions where the tumors were invading normal tissue ( Figure 7C ) , suggesting a role for CLIC3 in the invasive / metastatic behavior of pancreatic cancer . CLIC3 Predicts Metastasis and Poor Survival in PDAC To determine the relationship between CLIC3 levels and metas - tasis in vivo , we performed immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray ( TMA ) containing 118 cases ( 6 cores per patient ) of PDAC . Levels of CLIC3 did not differ in terms of tumor size , grade , stage , vascular invasion , or resection margin status . In univariate analysis , high CLIC3 expression at both the protein ( Figure 7E ) and mRNA ( Figure 7F ) levels was associated with signiﬁcantly decreased survival following resection of PDAC . Moreover , tumors removed from patients presenting with a lymph node ratio > 50 % had elevated levels of CLIC3 by com - parison with those with lower levels of lymph node involvement ( Figure 7D ) . Most importantly , in multivariate Cox proportional - hazards regression analysis , high CLIC3 expression remained an independent predictor of poor survival ( Table S2 ) . Rab25 has been reported to both promote and oppose tumor progression . We considered whether these conﬂicts in the literature may , in part , be explained by Rab25’s capacity to elevate CLIC3 levels in the tumor in question . Indeed , although the correlation between Rab25 and CLIC3 in pancreatic tumors is highly statistically signiﬁcant , this relationship is not hard and fast , and there are many tumors that express Rab25 that do not express CLIC3 and vice versa ( Figure 1H ) . In low CLIC3 expressors , high Rab25 levels were associated with signiﬁ - cantly increased patient survival ( Figure 7G ) . Conversely , Rab25 levels do not predict good clinical outcomes when CLIC3 is expressed ( Figure 7G ) . Taken together , these data indicate that in the absence of CLIC3 , Rab25 acts as a tumor suppressor . However , by driving CLIC3 expression , Rab25 increases tumor aggressiveness . DISCUSSION Here we demonstrate a pathway for trafﬁcking of activated a 5 b 1 integrins in tumor cells that relies ﬁrst on the ability of Rab25 to sort active heterodimers toward lysosomes , and then on CLIC3 to mediate the return of a 5 b 1 from late endosomes / lysosomes to the cell surface . Routing of receptors to lysosomes normally leads to their degradation . Indeed , a recent publication has shown that activated a 5 b 1 integrins are ubiquitinylated , trafﬁcked to lysosomes , and degraded ( Lobert et al . , 2010 ) . We concur that this is indeed the fate of lysosomally targeted integ - rins in the absence of CLIC3 expression . However , Rab25 is associated with elevated CLIC3 in both cultured A2780 cells and in pancreatic and ovarian tumors , and CLIC3 functions to return lysosomally targeted a 5 b 1 to the plasma membrane , thus opposing receptor degradation . Moreover , although it appears that ﬁbronectin and a 5 b 1 part company during passage through the late endosome / lysosome ( data not shown ) , photo - activation experiments and biochemical recycling assays indicate that the integrin need not , and does not , return to the inactive conformation prior to recycling . Thus , rather than switching conformations as they move through the endosomal pathway , integrins may be segregated into spatially distinct Developmental Cell CLIC3 , a 5 b 1 Recycling , and Cancer Developmental Cell 22 , 131 – 145 , January 17 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . 139 Figure 5 . Knockdown of CLIC3 Causes Migrating Cells to Pause and Suppresses Invasion into Fibronectin - Supplemented Matrigel ( A – D ) A2780 - Rab25 cells were transfected with nontargeting siRNA ( si - NT ) or with an siRNA targeting CLIC3 ( oligo # 4 ) ( si - CLIC3 ) , in combination with a 5 integrin ( a 5 b 1 ) , constitutively active a 5 integrin ( CA a 5 b 1 ) , and an siRNA - resistant CLIC3 rescue vector ( rescue ) as indicated . Transfected cells were plated onto CDM in the presence or absence of soluble ﬁbronectin ( 2 . 5 m g / ml ) , with or without baﬁlomycin ( 10 nM ) , and allowed to adhere for 24 hr prior to time - lapse microscopy .

It is reasonable to propose that a 5 b 1 that is recycled at the front contributes to pseudopod elongation , presumably by engaging fresh ECM . However , effective cell migration needs coordination of pseudopod extension with release / retraction of the cell rear . Following CLIC3 knockdown , although ad - vancing pseudopods continue to extend , the cell body does not efﬁciently translocate , causing migrating cells to pause for extended periods . These data are consistent with a role for retrograde integrin transport in retraction of the cell rear and / or release of the cell body from the substratum . In addition to promoting cell attachment , activated integrins are responsible for signaling events , such as Src activation , which lead to disas - sembly of adhesions , and CLIC3 is required to maintain active Src in invading cells . Thus , it is possible that CLIC3 - dependent retrograde integrin transport leads to activation of kinases such as Src at the cell rear to allow adhesion disassembly . It may seem counterintuitive to propose that delivery of an acti - vated adhesion receptor would act to reduce , rather than increase , adhesion . However , addition of plasma ﬁbronectin markedly decreases the pausing of cells migrating on CDM , and this may be owing to the ability of this soluble ligand to increase the quantity of active a 5 b 1 that is engaged in endocytic trafﬁcking and signaling to the adhesion disassembly machinery while decreasing that available for attachment to the substratum .

This is further supported by our observations that CLIC3 is enriched at tumor invasive margins , and that its expression correlates with lymph node metastases and subsequent death from disseminated disease . Signaling downstream of activated integrins cannot only promote cell migration but also other processes that are associated with metastasis , such as cell growth and survival . For instance , Src promotes cell transforma - tion by activating the transcription factor , STAT3 , which , in turn , leads to enhanced expression of genes such as cyclin D1 ( Sini - baldi et al . , 2000 ) . It is likely , therefore , that increased cycling through the CLIC3 pathway may contribute not only to cell migration but also to growth and survival of metastases by enhancing the capacity of active a 5 b 1 to activate Src and its downstream effectors . Furthermore , it is now apparent that a 5 b 1 - dependent Src activation contributes to suppression of apoptosis in suspended cells ( Haenssen et al . , 2010 ) , further supporting a role for a population of mobile ‘‘trafﬁcking’’ hetero - dimers in activating signaling in a way that does not require engagement with a substratum . There are conﬂicts in the literature as to whether Rab25 func - tions primarily as a promoter or suppressor of cancer . Loss of Rab25 is associated with tumor initiation in the colon ( Nam et al . , 2010 ) and ER - negative breast cancer ( Cheng et al . , 2006 , 2010 ) . Conversely , Rab25 expression correlates with decreased survival and increased aggressiveness of ovarian cancer ( Cheng et al . , 2004 ) , and enhanced invasive migration of ovarian cancer cells in vitro ( Caswell et al . , 2007 ) . The present study may resolve some of these conﬂicts . We propose that in tumors where CLIC3 is absent , Rab25 will act to route active integrins to lysosomes whereupon they will be degraded , thus terminating integrin signaling . Under these circumstances Rab25 will likely act as a tumor suppressor . Conversely , in tumors where Rab25 drives upregulation of CLIC3 , lysosomally routed active integrins will be returned to the plasma mem - brane , thus avoiding degradation and enabling their continued signaling to drive tumor progression . Further work will be necessary to deﬁne other key molecular components of the CLIC3 - regulated recycling pathway , and to determine how these can dictate Rab25’s capacity to promote or retard cancer progression . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cell Culture and Transfection Stable clones of A2780 - DNA3 and A2780 - Rab25 cells were generated as described previously . A2780 cells were cultivated in RPMI supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) serum at 37 (cid:1) C and 10 % CO 2 . Transfection of all vectors , small hairpin RNA interference ( shRNAi ) , and siRNA oligonucleotides ( Dharmacon ) was carried out using the Amaxa Nucleofector system ( solution T , program A - 23 ) according to manufacturer’s instructions . CDMs were generated as described previously ( Bass et al . , 2007 ; Cukierman et al . , 2001 ) , but in many experiments telomerase - immortalized ﬁbroblasts were substituted for primary cultured human dermal ﬁbroblasts without any noticeable alteration to the results . qPCR Analysis Cells were plated onto plastic and CDMs for 16 hr , and RNA was extracted using RNeasy kit ( QIAGEN ) . cDNA was synthesized using ImpromII kit ( Promega ) . qPCR was performed using SYBR green ( QIAGEN ) , QuantiTect Primer Assay kits ( QIAGEN ) , and a Chromo4 Engine ( Bio - Rad ) . DD C ( t ) method was used to calculate changes in gene expression with b - actin and GAPDH serving as reference genes . Antibody Generation , Immunohistochemistry , and Histoscore Analysis Recombinant GST - CLIC3 and His - tagged Rab25 were expressed in BL21 ( DE3 ) pLysS E . coli ( GST - tag was removed with PreScission Protease ) , and the Rab25 and CLIC3 proteins were afﬁnity puriﬁed and used for rabbit immunization ( Eurogentec ) . Formalin - ﬁxed and parafﬁn - embedded tissue sections were dewaxed in xylene and passed through ethanol ( 2 3 100 % , 1 3 70 % ) for rehydration . Heat - induced epitope retrieval was carried out in TRIS - EDTA ( pH 8 ) buffer . Endogenous peroxidase was then blocked using 3 % H 2 O 2 / methanol for 5 min before polyclonal rabbit CLIC3 - speciﬁc antibody was applied at 1 : 500 dilution for 45 min at room temperature . Tissue sections were then incubated in secondary antibody ( Dako Envision rabbit kit , K4003 ) for 40 min , and the staining was visualized with DAB and counterstained with Gills Hematoxylin . TMA The human pancreaticobiliary and ovarian TMAs were produced in the West of Scotland Pancreatic Unit , Glasgow Royal Inﬁrmary , and the Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre , Western General Hospital Edinburgh , respectively . The respective local Research Ethics Committees approved tissue sample collection . A total of 1 , 500 cores from 224 patients with pancreaticobiliary cancer ( including 118 cases with PDAC ) were arrayed on the TMA . From each patient at least six tumor cores ( 0 . 6 mm diameter ) and two cores of adja - cent normal tissue were sampled . For the ovarian TMA , 455 single cores were taken from representative tumor areas identiﬁed by a specialist gynecological pathologist and arrayed on two blocks . Full clinicopathological parameters and complete follow - up data were available for both tissue sets . To compare the length of survival between the two pancreatic expressor groups , a log rank analysis was performed . To adjust for competing risk factors , a Cox proportional hazards model and univariate analysis were used , and hazard ratios ( HRs ) with 95 % conﬁdence interval ( CI ) were reported as an estimate of the risk for disease - speciﬁc death . Clinicopathological parameters that wereidentiﬁedassigniﬁcant ( p < 0 . 10 ) inunivariateanalysiswereincorporated into the multivariate Cox regression analysis in a backward stepwise fashion . Statistical signiﬁcance for independent outcome predictors was set at p % 0 . 05 . Statisticalanalyseswereperformed withtheSPSSversion15 . 0 package ( SPSS , Chicago , IL , USA ) . For the quantiﬁcation of CLIC3 and Rab25 RNA levels in pancreatic tumors , fresh tumor tissue was collected from a more recent cohort of 48 patients with PDAC following pancreaticoduodenectomy along with 10 normal pancreatic specimens . Cancerous and normal tissue was frozen and stored at the Glas - gow Royal Inﬁrmary Biobank storage facility and subsequently underwent RNA extraction and microarray analysis ( Whole Human oligo - Microarray Kit 4 3 44K multiplex format ; Agilent Technologies , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . A comparison between normal tissue and PDAC specimens revealed that CLIC3 was overexpressed in the PDAC specimens . An unsupervised Kaplan - Meier survival analysis identiﬁed CLIC3 as being associated with outcome . Using the median CLIC3 mRNA expression value of the PDAC specimens as a cutoff , the cohort stratiﬁed into two groups with signiﬁcantly different survival outcomes . Cell Imaging and Photoactivation A2780 cells were seeded onto glass - bottomed 3 cm plates and imaged with a 64 3 objective of an inverted confocal microscope ( Fluoview FV1000 ; Olympus ) in an atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 at 37 (cid:1) C . Photoactivation of paGFP - a 5integrinwasachievedusinga405nmlaserofthatmicroscopeandOlympus SIM scanner . Colocalization quantiﬁcation was performed using ImageJ software , where the confocal images underwent two rounds of local contrast enhancement ( image blurring , subtraction of the blurred image , and subse - quentcontrastenhancement ) andthresholdadjustment . Thenumberofyellow pixels was then expressed as a percentage of pixels in the red channel . Recycling Assays Integrin recycling assays were performed as described previously in Roberts et al . ( 2001 ) . Brieﬂy , A2780 - Rab25 cells were serum starved for 1 hr , trans - ferred to ice , washed twice in cold PBS , and surface labeled at 4 (cid:1) C with 0 . 13 mg / ml NHS - SS - biotin ( Pierce ) in PBS for 30 min . Following surface labeling , cells were transferred to RPMI containing 10 % FCS with or without Developmental Cell CLIC3 , a 5 b 1 Recycling , and Cancer Developmental Cell 22 , 131 – 145 , January 17 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . 143 2 . 5 m g / ml bovine ﬁbronectin at 37 (cid:1) C to allow internalization of tracer . Cells were returned to ice and washed twice with ice - cold PBS , and biotin was removed from proteins remaining at the cell surface by reduction with MesNa . The internalized fraction was then chased from the cells by returning them to37 (cid:1) CRPMIcontaining10 % FCSwithorwithout2 . 5 m g / mlbovineﬁbronectin at 37 (cid:1) C . At the indicated times , cells were returned to ice , and biotin was removed from recycled proteins by a second reduction with MesNa . Biotinylated integrins were then determined by capture ELISA as follows . MaxiSorp 96 - well plates ( Life Technologies ) were coated overnight with 5 m g / ml of the appropriate anti - integrin antibodies ( PharMingen # 555651 for a 5 integrin or PharMingen 9EG7 for active b 1 ) in 0 . 05 M Na 2 CO 3 ( pH 9 . 6 ) at 4 (cid:1) C and blocked in PBS containing 0 . 1 % Tween 20 ( PBS - T ) with 5 % BSA for 1 hr at room temperature . Integrins were captured by overnight incubation of 50 m l of cell lysate at 4 (cid:1) C . Unbound material was removed by extensive washing with PBS - T , and wells were incubated with streptavidin - conjugated horseradish peroxidase ( Amersham ) in PBS - T containing 1 % BSA for 1 hr at 4 (cid:1) C . Following further washing , biotinylated integrins were detected by chromogenic reaction with ortho - phenylenediamine . Inverse Invasion Assay Inverse invasion assays were performed as described previously ( Hennigan et al . , 1994 ) . Brieﬂy , complete Matrigel was diluted in an equal volume of ice - coldPBSsupplementedwithsolubleﬁbronectin ( 25 m g / mlﬁnalconcentra - tion ) . A total of 100 m l of the diluted Matrigel mix was pipetted into a Transwell ( 8 m mdiameter pores ) , insertedinto awellof a24 - well tissueculture plate , and left to set at 37 (cid:1) C . The Transwells were then inverted , and 4 3 10 4 cells were placedontheundersideoftheﬁlter . TheTranswellswerethencoveredwiththe base of the 24 - well tissue culture plate so that they made contact with cell suspension droplets . Cell attachment was allowed to proceed for 4 hr , before the plate was inverted back and the nonadherent cells were washed off by three sequential washes in 1 ml of serum - free medium . The Transwells were placed in 1 ml of serum - free medium , which constituted the lower chamber of the assay , and 100 m l of 10 % FCS - RPMI supplemented with 25 ng / ml EGF was pipetted on top of the Transwell . The cells were then allowed to invade into the Matrigel and toward the gradient of serum and EGF for 48 hr at 37 (cid:1) C in the atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 . To visualize cells that migrated into the Matrigel plug , 4 m M Calcein AM ( acetoxymethyl ester of calcein ) was used . After 1 hr at 37 (cid:1) C , the cells were imaged by confocal microscopy using a Leica SP2 confocal microscope and a 20 3 objective at an excitation wave - length of 488 nm and emission wavelength of 515 nm . Optical sections were captured at 15 m m intervals , starting from the underside of the Transwell ﬁlter and moving upward in the direction of cell invasion . The resulting images were quantiﬁed and assembled into invasive strips using ImageJ software . The threshold ﬂuorescence intensity of the images was set to only register cells that lay within each individual optical slice , and the sum of the ﬂuorescence in the sections from 30 or 45 m m and above was divided by the total ﬂuo - rescence of all the sections , thus giving an invasion index ‘‘beyond 30 or 45 m m , ’’respectively . Dataweregeneratedfromatleastthreeindividualexper - iments , in which each condition was represented by three Transwells , and optical sections were taken from at least three areas of each Transwell . Organotypic Invasion Assays Approximately 7 . 5 3 10 4 / ml primary human ﬁbroblasts were embedded in a matrix of rat tail collagen I . Rat tail tendon collagen was prepared by extrac - tionwith0 . 5Maceticacid , toaconcentrationof (cid:3) 2mg / ml . Polymerizedmatrix was allowed to contract for approximately 7 days and until the ﬁbroblasts contracted the matrix to a plug of approximately 1 . 5 cm in diameter . Subse - quently , 4 3 10 4 A2780 - Rab25 cells were plated onto the matrix and allowed to grow to conﬂuence for 4 days . The matrix was then transferred onto a metal grid and raised to the air / liquid interface . The matrix was thus fed from under - neath with complete media supplemented with 25 ng / ml EGF , which was changed every 2 days . After 14 days , the plugs were ﬁxed in 4 % PFA , parafﬁn embedded , sectioned , and stained for H & E or for P - Src and counterstained with hematoxylin . Expression Constructs a 5 integrin constructs were expressed as GFP - fusion proteins and were tagged with GFP at the C terminus ( cytoplasmic domain ) . The GFP a 5 integrin was generously donated by Donna Webb and is exactly as described in Laukaitis et al . ( 2001 ) and Webb et al . ( 2007 ) . The human gene sequence for CLIC3 ( a generous gift from Mark Berryman ) was inserted into the pEGFP - C1 vector using XhoI ( 5 0 ) and BamHI ( 3 0 ) . The EGFP sequence was then replaced with the red ﬂuorescent protein , mCherry , sequence using AgeI ( 5 0 ) and XhoI ( 3 0 ) such that the ﬂuorescent tag is attached in frame to the N terminus of CLIC3 . The human sequence of CLIC3 was tagged with the FLAG epitope at the N terminus using PCR and then inserted into the pcDNA3 expression vector using BamHI ( 5 0 ) and Nod ( 3 0 ) . For expression of GST - tagged proteins , the human sequence of CLIC3 was ligated into the pGEX - 6P - 1 vector using BamHI ( 3 0 to the prescission site and 5 0 of the CLIC3 sequence ) and Nod ( 3 0 to CLIC3 ) .
