Introduction Uncontrolled proliferation of mesangial cells in kidney is a com - mon feature of numerous diseases that can eventually end up with end - stage renal failure . IgA nephropathy ( IgAN ) , a type of mesan - gioproliferative glomerulonephritis , is the most frequent primary form of glomerulonephritis worldwide and is considered as the major cause of end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) [ 1 , 2 ] . Severe impair - ment of renal function occurred in ESRD leads to the need of renal replacement therapy including kidney transplantation and dialysis . In long term follow - up , approximately 30 – 50 % of patients with IgAN will register for renal replacement therapy [ 3 , 4 ] . Mesangial proliferation is the major histological characteristics of IgA nephropathy independent from different etiologies of the disease , which occurs in association with IgA dominant or co - dominant immune deposits on these cells [ 5 , 6 ] . Mesangial cells , located between the capillary endothelial cells and the basal membrane of the glomeruli , are involved in blood ﬂow regulation and phagocytosis [ 7 – 9 ] . Intracapillary location and inﬂammatory molecule synthesis of mesangial cells makes them potential sensitive places for glomerular injury [ 10 ] . Occur - rence of proliferation could be reinforced and resumed by a revival cycle mediated by growth factors , cytokines , chemokines and oxi - dant molecules and with the involvement of extracellular matrix deposition and glomerulosclerosis [ 11 , 12 ] . The stepwise mecha - nism of mesangial cell proliferation and the precise set of the involved signaling molecules are still to be discovered . Due to technical limitations , identiﬁcation of the signaling intermediates is typically not a cost effective task . A predictive method by bioinformatics tools based on evidence - based data - bases could be a more logical start point for identiﬁcation of candi - date intermediate signaling molecules . For example , in order to ﬁnd pathways involved in IgAN , Cox et al . [ 13 ] used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to assess the biological relationships among dif - ferentially expressed genes of peripheral blood mononuclear cell . Unfolding the puzzle of proliferation mechanism of mesangial cells in IgAN by means of in silico methods may help to predict key regulatory pathways , and consequently , suggest potential tar - gets for efﬁcient therapeutic intervention . In the present study , an attempt was made to predict the speciﬁc molecular mechanism of proliferation in the glomerular mesangial cells as the main site of injury in IgAN . The results suggest candidate pathologic pathways http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . mehy . 2016 . 10 . 014 0306 - 9877 / (cid:1) 2016 Elsevier Ltd .

Hypothesis Mesangial cell proliferation is a key histological marker in a number of renal diseases including IgA nephropathy , mesangial proliferative lupus glomerulonephritis , membranous proliferative glomerulonephritis and diabetic nephropathy [ 14 ] . One of the important functions of mesangial cells is phagocytosis of locally accumulated macromolecules such as imunoglobulines ( e . g . , IgA and IgG ) through speciﬁc or non - speciﬁc mechanisms [ 15 ] . The speciﬁc removal is mediated by receptors and triggers speciﬁc pathways by which mesangial cells respond to signals like prolifer - ation . Proliferation of mesangial cells might be due to compensa - tion for removal of immunoglobulins or other macromolecules or might be due to stimulatory effect of growth factors including PDGF - C , ﬁbroblast growth factor , hepatocyte growth factor , EGF , connective tissue growth factor , and TGF - b [ 16 – 18 ] . However , while immunoglobulin deposition is suggested as one of the possi - ble causes of proliferation process in mesangial cells , it is not com - mon in glomerulonephritis diseases other than IgA nephropathy . On the other hand , IgA deposition ( in IgA nephropathy and not essentially in other forms of proliferative glomerulonephritis ) is always associated with proliferation process . As mesangial cell proliferation is the possible phenomenon which occurs in different types of glomerulonephritis , we specu - late that different mechanisms and signaling pathway ( s ) might contribute in this process based on etiology of the disease . In other words , mesangial proliferation occurs only in some cases of focal segmental glomerulonephritis , membranous glomerulonephritis , membranous proliferative glomerulonephritis and lupus nephritis and other glomerulopathies but always happens in IgAN . Further - more , it has been previously observed that in IgAN , IgA1 - containing immune complexes differentially inﬂuence the prolifer - ation of mesangial cells [ 19 ] . Based on these facts , we hypothesized that mesangial proliferation in IgA nephropathy must have a speci - ﬁc mechanism related to IgA which is induced directly by deposi - tion of IgA dominated immune complexes on mesangial cells in the glomeruli . Induction of proliferation process by IgA is likely to be initiated by interaction between IgA and its speciﬁc receptor on mesangial cells . As transferrin receptor ( TFRC ) expression on mesangial cells was strongly correlated with the presence of IgA deposits , based on experimental data [ 20 , 16 ] , one may consider it as a major ( but not the only ) candidate IgA receptor on mesangial cells [ 10 ] . We selected TFRC as the mesangial receptor speciﬁc for IgA and considered it as the start point of proliferation signaling pathway . Exploration of interacted intermediate proteins between TFRC and proteins of which expression were differentially changed in mesangial cells of IgA nephropathy patients by means of protein - DNA interaction analysis could elucidate the possible pathway ( s ) responsible for proliferation . Evaluation of the hypothesis We analyzed kidney biopsy samples of 98 non - IgA nephropathy patients to investigate the mesangial cell proliferation status . The immunoﬂuorescent staining was used to determine whether IgA deposit occurs on mesangial cells or not and light microscopy imaging was applied to investigate the proliferation of mesangial cells in the glomeruli . The results of this analysis are summarized in Table 1 . Based on these data 62 . 5 % of cases with mesangial pro - liferation were not associated with deposition of immunoglobulins or other immune molecules ( 26 % of all cases ) . This observation suggests that : ( a ) removal of immune complex or other macro - molecule deposits might not be the major cause of mesangial pro - liferation ; ( b ) proliferation process in non - IgA nephropathy cases might be either speciﬁc ( receptor dependent ) or non - speciﬁc ( receptor independent ) , while it is deﬁnitely speciﬁc for IgA nephropathy ; and ( c ) mesangial proliferation is a complex process regulated by different pathways in different diseases . Furthermore , based on these preliminary data , while IgA deposition is not neces - sarily associated with mesangial proliferation in non - IgAN cases ( such as lupus nephritis without mesangial proliferation ) , speciﬁc forms of IgA ( polymeric form or poor galactosilated form ) , which is only present in IgAN , might stimulate proliferation in the mesan - gial cells through a speciﬁc pathway . Based on the literature , receptor candidates which interact with IgA are : ( 1 ) IgA Fc receptor ( CD89 ) , which binds both IgA1 and IgA2 [ 21 ] ; ( 2 ) the polymeric - Ig receptor , which binds polymeric IgA and IgM [ 22 ] ; ( 3 ) Fc a / l R , which binds IgA and IgM [ 17 ] ; ( 4 ) asialogly - coprotein receptor ( ASGP - R ) , which binds IgA1 and IgA2 through terminal galactose moiety ; and ( 5 ) transferrin receptor ( TFRC or CD71 ) which binds IgA1 [ 16 ] . The latter receptor is the only IgA speciﬁc receptor overexpressed on the glomerular mesangial cells in IgAN [ 20 ] , and hence , it is considered as the best candidate for investigation its role on proliferation through IgA induction . More - over , involvement of transferrin receptors in the cell growth and proliferation has been reported earlier [ 23 – 25 ] . In another study , Moura et al . indicated that interaction between IgA1 and TFRC induces mesangial cell proliferation and secretion of inﬂammatory cytokines such as IL - 6 and TGF - b [ 10 ] . Moreover , Tamouza et al . in 2007 showed that TFRC in cultured HMC is overexpressed under the inﬂuence of sera from IgAN patients in an IgA - dependent manner [ 26 ] . These ﬁndings are in favor of activation of speciﬁc signaling pathway ( s ) originated from TFRC induction by IgA1 but the molecular mediators of such signal - ing pathway ( s ) are to be determined . In the following sections we review proliferation signaling initiation from TFRC and prolifera - tion signaling in the mesangial cells . TFRC - related proliferation pathways According to the literature , there is a known relationship between TFRC and cell proliferation [ 27 – 29 , 16 ] but the stimulators of cell activation seem to be different in different cell types and hence different pathways might be involved . For instance , Kindrat et al . recently have shown that epigenetic controls of TFRC gene and impaired iron homeostasis inﬂuence proliferation in hepato - cellular carcinoma [ 27 ] . Pham et al . showed the effect of Sphin - gosine kinase 1 ( SK1 ) on the expression of TFR1 and transferrin uptake in tumor development [ 28 ] . Other researchers believe the ﬁbrosis and renal impairment following TFR related proliferation in the kidney is consequence of inﬂammatory response by promot - ing the release of proinﬂammatory cytokines , such as IL - 1 , IL - 6 and TNF - a [ 29 , 16 ] . Well deﬁned signaling pathways related to transferrin trafﬁck - ing and proliferation are : ( 1 ) inositol - 1 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate and dia - cylglycerol signaling pathway , ( 2 ) MAPK signaling pathway , and ( 3 ) growth factors signaling pathway [ 30 ] . In the ﬁrst pathway , phospholipase C ( PLC ) is activated and hydrolizes phosphatidylino sitol - 4 , 5 - diphosphate ( PI - 4 , 5 - P2 ) to inositol - 1 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate ( InsP3 ) and diacylglycerol ( DAG ) . DAG , thus activates protein kinase C ( PKC ) and InsP3 inﬂuences the release Ca2 + stored in the endoplasmic reticulum . The InsP3 / Ca2 + signaling can control proliferation [ 31 – 33 ] . The second pathway ( MAPK signaling ) is activated by tyrosine kinase - linked receptors ( such as TFRC ) result - ing in the phosphorylation of extracellular signal - regulated kinases 1 / 2 ( ERK1 / 2 ) that then translocate into the nucleus which controls many cellular processes , particularly those related to cell prolifer - ation [ 30 ] . The third signaling pathway through growth factors E . S . Mirfazeli et al . / Medical Hypotheses 97 ( 2016 ) 38 – 45 39 produce phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) that contributes to sending information to the target of rapamycin ( TOR ) signaling pathway [ 30 , 33 ] . TOR is a serine / threonine protein kinase that acti - vates cell proliferation under the condition of starvation [ 30 ] . Pathways related to proliferation in the mesangial cells A few pathways and mediator molecules that can potentially be involved in mesangial cell proliferation are reviewed here . Tamouza et al . performed a study speciﬁcally on proliferation mesangial cells in IgA nephropathy patients [ 34 ] . They could recog - nize a pattern of signaling molecules which was dependent on the level of proteinuria . Accordingly , phosphor ( p ) - ERK1 / 2 expression was detected by immunohistochemical analysis in > 20 % mesangial cells of the renal biopsy from subjects with IgA nephropathy and with > 1 g / day proteinuria . ERK1 / 2 are known signaling molecules from mitogen - activated protein kinase / extracellular signal – regulated kinase ( MAPK / ERK ) pathway involved in regulation of cell proliferation , hypertrophy , cytokine secretion , and extracellular matrix synthesis [ 35 ] . In the Tamouza et al . study , p - ERK1 / 2 was observed in the cell nuclei in patients with > 1 g / day proteinuria . Furthermore , expression pat - tern of these signaling molecules was correlated with high blood pressure . Activation of MAPK / ERK signaling pathway was detected in a fraction of the subjects and lack of correlation with serum galactose ( Gal ) - deﬁcient IgA1 levels , which are often ( but not always ) elevated in IgAN patients [ 36 ] , support the hypothesis regarding the possibility of involvement several pathways in the mesangial proliferation depends on different clinical manifesta - tions in IgA nephropathy . Furthermore , those results conﬁrmed that the pathways leading to mesangial proliferation originate from TFRC engagement by pIgA1 . The details of the involved sig - naling pathway were not determined in that study . Gao et al . on the other hand , investigated the proliferative effect of TNF - like weak inducer of apoptosis ( TWEAK ) on mesangial cells in the kidney [ 37 ] . They observed a signiﬁcant proliferation in in vitro and in vivo studies presumably through TWEAK receptor Fn14 . The study was performed on a human mesangial cell line and the following signaling molecules remained unclear . In a recent study on animal models , Lu et al . suggested the involvement of cyclins and p53 in the pathology of mesangial pro - liferative nephritis . However , they did not evaluate human sub - jects , and speciﬁcally , patients with IgA nephropathy [ 38 ] . To sum up , the details of the pathways which mediate the mesangial cell proliferation in IgA nephropathy are to be deter - mined . The goal of this study is to present new hypotheses on the nature of these pathways and their involved intermediates . However , this study does not rule out the other possible pathways implicated in the mesangial proliferation via IgA dominant immune complex . Pathway analysis ( for Evaluation of the Hypothesis ) Identiﬁcation of the novel signaling network For uncovering the signaling pathways in the context of interac - tion network , ANAT ( Advanced Network Analysis Tool ) was applied [ 39 , 40 ] . ANAT is an interactive tool for inferring functional protein - protein interaction and protein - DNA interaction networks running in Cytoscape platform [ 41 ] . Unlike most of PPI network inference tools , the database of ANAT includes only physical interactions . Each interaction in the network is assigned a conﬁdence score Table 1 The preliminary data on involvement the mesangial immune depositions in mesangial proliferation in non - IgA nephropathy patients .

For instance , IgM might exist in some patients with membranous glomerulonephritis but not in other patients with the same disease and vice versa . 40 E . S . Mirfazeli et al . / Medical Hypotheses 97 ( 2016 ) 38 – 45 based on the experimental evidence that support them . Another distinguishing feature of the application is offering anchored PPI analyses tool that connects phenotype related proteins to one or more anchor nodes initiating the signaling pathway . In this study , we deﬁned TFRC , the speciﬁc receptor of glomeru - lar mesangial cells , as the root node which is responsible for initi - ation of the signaling cascade of cell proliferation . Furthermore , a list of 203 phenotype - related genes , which represent the speciﬁcally - expressed genes in the mesangial cells of IgA nephropathy patients , are chosen as the terminal nodes . Contribu - tion of these differentially - expressed genes in IgAN had been con - ﬁrmed experimentally [ 42 ] . The complete list of these proteins is presented in Table S1 . In order to obtain the highest possible amount of information and correctly recognize the transcription factors which regulate the pathways , we selected protein interaction of human as the background network . ANAT uses ‘‘Charikar - a algorithm” for con - structing the network . In this algorithm , parameter a is the sole adjustable parameter , which can be set in the range of 0 – 0 . 5 . This parameter can control the relative importance of the local and glo - bal criteria . The local approach provides reliable pathways between the root and the terminal nodes , by maximization of the likelihood of connecting pathways and includes many extra genes that are not known to be phenotype - related . IN contrast the global approach results in a holistic but adjusted network connecting the root to all the terminals by minimization the number of such extra genes . The value for a was set as 0 . 25 to consider the equal impor - tance between local and global models in the network and achiev - ing the best results . The Charikar - a algorithm analyzes all of the available interaction data that connect the root to subsets of the terminals iteratively until the entire set of terminals is covered and then identiﬁes subtrees with a high conﬁdence level . The path - ways are then reported with the corresponding gene ontology enrichment [ 43 ] results by Cytoscape . Evaluation of the constructed network The constructed network was ﬁltered in three steps : 1 ) ﬁltration based on the corrected p - value of Gene Ontology enrichment analysis ; 2 ) evaluation of the speciﬁcity of the method ; and 3 ) literature based veriﬁcation , i . e . , only pathways with reason - able direction of interaction ( from root toward terminals ) are kept in the analysis . To evaluate the speciﬁcity of the results ( step 2 above ) , we per - formed a permutation - based validation . Brieﬂy , the interaction network was reconstructed 50 times using 50 lists of 200 terminal nodes that randomly selected from the human glomerular gene expression proﬁle reported by Lindenmeyer et al . [ 44 ] . The sur - vived pathways from the original list after the ﬁrst ﬁltration of which conﬁdence level > 95 % of the conﬁdence level in the random pathways were considered signiﬁcant . In this analysis , only minor adjustments were done on the pre - liminary network . The changes include removing Transferrin pro - tein from the network due to its irrelevance to our disease and forcing directionality from TFRC to its neighboring proteins . Analysis of the signaling network Fig . 1 shows the view of the interaction network . Overall , ANAT generated 203 pathways , of which 29 pathways were found to be signiﬁcant according to Gene Ontology enrichment analysis ( cor - rected p - value < 0 . 05 ) . Signiﬁcant pathways according to the ﬁrst step of ﬁltration are listed as Table S2 . In the second step of ﬁltra - tion , the conﬁdence level of 13 pathways in the original anchored network was > 95 % of conﬁdence level in the random pathways after 50 times permutations ( see the bold pathways in Table S2 ) . In the third step of ﬁltration , direction of the interactions was examined by literature searching and seven annotated pathways containing reverse interactions from terminals toward root were excluded . At the end , six pathways were considered as ﬁnal signif - icant subnetwork involved in proliferation of mesangial cells in IgAN ( see Table 2 and Fig . 2 ) . We also considered the results of gene ontology enrichment analysis of the ANAT ﬁnal report to ﬁnd the biological processes which are involved in this disease . Using gene ontology analysis , ‘‘positive regulation of cell killing” , ‘‘positive regulation of immune effector process” and ‘‘multicellular organismal homeostasis” pro - cesses were found to be signiﬁcantly over - represented in the pathways . Suggestion for experimental evaluation of the hypothesis Beside statistical methods bioinformatic approaches are safe and affordable technique that helps to introduce valuable candi - dates for experimental testing based on a computational logical trend . This hypothesis and signaling targets with a reasonable background could be tested in vitro ( human mesangial cells ) or in vivo ( animal models ) . Suggested in vitro procedure is : ( 1 ) puriﬁ - cation IgA dominant immune complex from the serum of patients with IgA nephropathy , ( 2 ) Treated human mesangial cells ( HMC ) with appropriate concentration of extracted immune complexes ( IC ) and comparison with control group ( non - treated HMC ) , ( 3 ) proliferation assay of HMC after treated with IC , 4 ) evaluation the changes of target proteins using western blotting , ELISA or using high resolution mass spectrometric based quantiﬁcation method such as selective reaction monitoring ( SRM ) . Discussion Deposition of IgA1 on mesangial cells in the glomeruli followed by mesangial cell proliferation is one of the characteristics of initial phase of IgAN [ 45 , 46 ] . The mechanism for proliferation of mesan - gial cells is still unclear . However phospholipase C - c 1 activation , inositol triphosphate formation , and Ca 2 + mobilization , which is linked to activation of tyrosine kinase , were reported earlier as the possible mediators of proliferation via IgA Fc receptor [ 47 ] . The characterization of transferrin receptor as a speciﬁc IgA1 receptor on renal mesangial cells [ 16 ] , elucidated the TFRC – IgA1 interaction as a basis for mesangial IgA1 deposition in IgAN , and consequently , functional changes including proliferation in the mesangial cells . However , this ﬁnding does not exclude the possi - bility of involvement of other IgA receptors ( e . g . , Fc receptor [ 48 – 50 ] or asialoglycoprotein receptor [ 51 ] ) , which are not speciﬁcally expressed in glomerular mesangium . Our computational results propose the signaling pathways by which proliferation is induced . These ﬁndings can be seen as a starting point for the future experiments . Based on these results , at the beginning of the signaling cascade , IgA1 - activated TFRC binds to HFE ( Hereditary hemochromatosis protein ) , a protein associated in iron homeostasis [ 10 , 52 ] . Nevertheless , activation of proliferation signaling through TFRC and HFE in IgAN is indepen - dent from their role in iron homeostasis [ 10 ] . HFE , which has been originally identiﬁed as a human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) class I - like protein , then interacts with B2 - microglobulin ( b2M ) for the presentation of HFE to the cell surface and correct subcellular dis - tribution [ 53 ] . B2 - microglobulin is a subunit of all major histocom - patibility class ( MHC ) 1 molecules that subsequently interacts with HLA - A . Involvement of HLA class I signaling pathways has been E . S . Mirfazeli et al . / Medical Hypotheses 97 ( 2016 ) 38 – 45 41 reported in the proliferation of various cells ( e . g . vascular ECs , SMCs , T cells , and B cells ) and regulation of apoptosis in activated T and B cells [ 54 – 56 ] . Here , we suggest the possible involvement of this protein in the mesangial proliferation signaling . HLA - A stimu - lates tyrosine phosphorylation activity of a member of SRC family [ 57 ] , a non - receptor protein tyrosine kinase participates in a diverse spectrum of signaling pathways , which likely results in activation of ESR1 proteolysis [ 58 ] . Negative correlation of SRC and ESR1 levels has been previously reported in uncontrolled pro - liferative cells like primary breast cancer cells [ 58 ] . On the other hand , there is evidence on stimulation of Src / Shc / Ras / Erk pathway via ESR1 [ 59 ] . Under proliferative conditions , estradiol activation can lead to increased expression of cyclin D1 , nuclear exclusion of the CDK inhibitor p27 , and stimulation of G1 - S transition in can - cer cells [ 60 , 61 ] , and therefore , can positively regulate prolifera - tion . In line with the contradictory data , it seems that the relationship between SRC and ESR1 is reciprocal , complex and depend on the conditions . In addition , according to experimental data , ESR1 is the dominant isoform of estrogen receptors expressed in glomeruli and in isolated mesangial cells [ 62 , 63 ] that involves in regulation of numerous target genes , including regulators of prolif - eration . Some reports suggest a reverse relationship between sig - Fig . 1 . The protein interaction network of proliferation in mesangial cells in IgA nephropathy .

S . Mirfazeli et al . / Medical Hypotheses 97 ( 2016 ) 38 – 45 naling pathways via estrogen mediators and renal damage , espe - cially in mesangial cells [ 64 , 65 ] . In other words , ECM synthesis stimulated by TGF - b 1 , angiotensin II , and endothelin - 1 leading to ﬁbrosis , as well as the production of growth promoters that induce glomerulosclerosis are inhibited by estrogen metabolites [ 66 , 67 ] that act through estrogen receptors . This observation implies that estrogen metabolites ( and consequently , the estrogen receptor ) have renoprotective roles [ 65 ] . In our results , the complex interac - tion between SRC and ESR1 suggests activation of the proliferation pathway . This activation results in altered expression of prolifera - tive and apoptotic markers speciﬁcally in kidney mesangial cells , independent from estrogen and estrogen metabolite ligands . Nota - bly , this activation is done through a network started from immune complex deposition . Association between polymorphism of ESR1 gene and IgAN also conﬁrms the importance of this protein in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy [ 68 ] . Additionally , our ﬁnd - ings are consistent with other observations about estrogen recep - tor involvement in the pathogenesis of renal diseases [ 69 ] . In our results , all of the six signiﬁcant pathways share the same interactions from TFRC toward ESR1 . Therefore , ESR1 has the high - est degree of interactions and acts as a key molecule that could affect a set of proteins and transcription factors . According to gene ontology ( GO ) annotations , we suggest that IgA deposition might stimulate down regulation of terminal nodes of the pathways ( including CEBPB , CAV1 , MGMT , COX5A ) under the annotation of ‘‘positive regulation of cell killing” . This claim can be conﬁrmed experimentally in the further analysis . In addition , as mentioned earlier , involvement of MAPK / ERK signaling pathway in mesangial proliferation has been proven experimentally [ 34 ] . Interaction between ESR1 , as a key molecule in the signiﬁcant sub - network , and other four nodes ( i . e . CAV1 , EP300 , TAL1 and CEBPB ) with elements of MAPK / ERK signaling pathway indicates the cross - talk between these two pathways ( Fig . 3 ) . Activation of MAPK sig - naling by TFRC [ 30 ] , Strengthen the possibility of interconnection between IgA - speciﬁc pathway and known MAPK signaling via ESR1 . Our ﬁndings are in accordance with the observation of Tamouza et al . [ 34 ] and elucidates the candidate missing molecules by which p - ERK1 / 2 induce proliferation in mesangial cells in response to IgA deposition . This interaction , also highlights the role of ESR1 as an important player in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy , and additionally , as a potential target for its therapy . Conclusion In this study , we constructed a network of mesangial cell prolif - eration pathways speciﬁc for IgA nephropathy . The ﬁnal signiﬁcant subnetwork starts from TFRC , a speciﬁc receptor of IgA1 on the glomerular mesangial cells , and ends in six proteins related to pro - liferation of the mesangial cells , namely COX5A , LTF , CEBPB , CAV1 , MGMT , and XBP1 . Among the pathway mediators , ESR1 is the most important intermediate node in the signiﬁcant subnetwork and we suggest it as a potential target for the future experiments . The sug - gested pathway improves our understanding of the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy , and suggests the existence of a speciﬁc prolif - eration process in this disease , which is distinct from other prolif - erative glomerulonephritis . Future interventions to regulate this pathway can be promising for presenting a new therapeutic strat - egy for IgA nephropathy .
