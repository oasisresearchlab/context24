Here , common crossbills with clipped wings produced redder 21 feathers than controls . 22 23 Abstract 24 The animal signaling theory posits that conspicuous colorations exhibited by many 25 animals have evolved as reliable signals of individual quality . Red carotenoid - based 26 ornaments may depend on enzymatic transformations ( oxidation ) of dietary yellow 27 carotenoids , which could occur in the inner mitochondrial membrane ( IMM ) . Thus , 28 carotenoid ketolation and cell respiration could share the same biochemical 29 pathways . Accordingly , the level of trait expression ( redness ) would directly reveal 30 the efficiency of individuals ' metabolism and hence , the bearer quality in an 31 unfalsifiable way . Different avian studies have described that the flying effort may 32 induce oxidative stress . A redox metabolism modified during the flight could thus 33 influence the carotenoid conversion rate and , ultimately , animal coloration . Here , we 34 aimed to infer the link between red carotenoid - based ornament expression and flight 35 metabolism by increasing flying effort in wild male common crossbills Loxia 36 curvirostra ( Linnaeus ) . In this order , 295 adult males were captured during winter in 37 an Iberian population . Half of the birds were experimentally handicapped through 38 wing feather clipping to increase their flying effort , the other half being used as a 39 control group . The rump feathers were also plucked in all the birds to stimulate 40 plumage regrown of a small surface during a short time - lapse . Thirty - four birds with 41 fully grown rump feathers could be recaptured in the subsequent weeks . Among them , 42 male crossbills with experimentally impaired flying capacity showed redder rump 43 feathers than controls . This result would support the hypothesis that the flying 44 metabolism influences the redox enzymatic reactions required for converting yellow 45 dietary carotenoids to red ketocarotenoids . 46 47 48 INTRODUCTION 49 Conspicuous colorations in many animal species have attracted the attention of 50 evolutionary biologists from Charles Darwin . The current animal signaling theory 51 posits that these traits may evolve as individual quality signals that act in sexual or 52 social signaling contexts ( Maynard Smith and Harper 2003 ) . If evolving as individual 53 quality signals , the traits should transmit reliable information favoring the receiver’s 54 fitness ( Maynard Smith and Harper 2003 ) . It has been hypothesized that the signal 55 reliability is maintained by the costs of trait production , preventing potential cheaters 56 from correctly expressing the trait ( i . e . handicap signals ; Zahavi 1975 , Grafen 1990 ; 57 also e . g . a recent review in Penn and Számadó 2020 ) . Additionally , or alternatively , 58 signal reliability could be assured when a close link between the trait development 59 process and the signaler’s intrinsic quality is established . These traits are known as 60 index signals ( Maynard Smith and Harper 2003 ) . The most easily recognizable index 61 signals are some beetles ' huge weapons ( mandibles ) , big antlers of ungulates and frog 62 or deer vocalization frequencies , which are all strongly correlated to individual body 63 size ( e . g . Bierniasky et al . , 2014 ) . All of them should allow inferring individual quality 64 because body size determines individual fitness in these species ( Maynard Smith and 65 Harper 2003 ) . 66 In the last years , another index signal type has been proposed . It is produced 67 by pigments ( red keto - carotenoids ) whose synthesis could be produced at the core of 68 the cell respiratory function , i . e . into the mitochondrion ( Hill 2011 ; Johnson and Hill 69 2013 ; Cantarero and Alonso - Alvarez 2017 ) . We should first mention that , in many 70 avian species , the red colorations are generated by converting yellow carotenoids 71 acquired with food into red keto - carotenoids ( McGraw 2006 ; Johnson and Hill 2013 ) . 72 That transformation involves redox enzymatic reactions ( McGraw 2006 ; Johnson and 73 Hill 2013 ) . The cited change is performed by a group of enzymes ( ketolases ) that 74 seems to be located at the inner mitochondrial membrane ( IMM ; Johnson and Hill 75 2013 ; Hill et al . 2019 ) . This means they would share the biochemical pathways 76 involved in cell respiration ( i . e . the shared - pathway hypothesis ; see Hill 2011 ; 77 Johnson and Hill 2013 ) . Thus , the level of trait expression ( redness ) would directly 78 reveal the basis of metabolic function and , therefore , the bearer quality in an 79 unfalsifiable way ( Hill 2011 ) . 80 Otto Völker ( 1957 ) was probably the first to suggest that red carotenoid - based 81 colorations are constrained by redox metabolism ( see also Weber 1953 and 1961 ) . He 82 studied male common crossbills ( Loxia curvirostra , Linnaeus ) , whose plumage color 83 ranges from dull yellow to bright red , and feather redness is due to feather 84 ketocarotenoid accumulation ( Del Val et al . 2009a ; Cantarero et al . 2020a ) . The 85 researcher observed that the red males housed in cages could not replace their 86 original red plumages and were always molted to produce yellow feathers . He 87 suspected that , contrarily , crossbills allowed to fly could produce red feathers because 88 they would have a better redox metabolism favoring the conversion of dietary yellow 89 pigments ( also Weber 1961 ) . 90 Different avian studies have described that the flying effort may increase 91 oxidative stress ( e . g . Costantini et al . 2008 ; Jenni - Eiermann et al . , 2014 ; Yap et al . , 92 2017 ) . Oxidative stress is usually defined as an imbalance between the production 93 rate of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) due to cell metabolism and the state of different 94 antioxidant defenses ( e . g . Sies and Jones 2007 ) . It leads to oxidative damage , which is 95 involved in senescence and age - related diseases ( Barja 2014 ) . An important part of 96 ROS in cells is generated into the mitochondrion during cell respiration ( St - Pierre et 97 al . , 2002 ; Zhang and Wong 2021 ) . The flying effort , manipulated by training or 98 inferred from migratory behavior , was positively correlated to mitochondrial 99 oxidative stress in birds ' blood and pectoral muscles ( i . e . , Gerson et al . , 2012 ; 100 Gutierrez et al . , 2019 ) . It has also been correlated to higher superoxide dismutase 2 ( a 101 specific mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme ) gene expression in avian pectoral muscles 102 ( Banerjee and Chaturvedi , 2016 ) . Therefore , we can hypothesize that the redox 103 metabolism modified during the flight could influence the carotenoid conversion rate 104 and , ultimately , body coloration , such as early proposed by Völker ( 1957 ) . 105 However , the evidence to the present date is weak and mostly based on a few 106 avian studies where flying effort was increased and color expression measured . First , 107 Schmidt - Wellenburg et al . ( 2008 ) augmented the flying workload of captive Rosy 108 starlings ( Pastor roseus ; Linnaeus ) by using a wind tunnel . Their pink plumage is 109 generated by red ketocarotenoids ( Galván et al . 2019 ) , but no significant effect on 110 plumage color after the natural molt was detected ( Schmidt - Wellenburg et al . 2008 ) . 111 Leclaire et al . ( 2011 ) also increased the flying effort of wild adult kittiwakes ( Rissa 112 trydactila ; Stephens ) but in this case by clipping some wing feathers during 113 reproduction . This technique has often been used to manipulate the cost of 114 reproduction with different objectives ( e . g . Slagsvold and Lifjeld 1990 ; Ardia and 115 Clotfelter 2007 ; Cantarero et al . , 2014 ) . Leclaire et al . ( 2011 ) reported a brightness 116 decline in the red bill gape of kittiwakes ( a trait also colored by ketocarotenoids : see 117 Leclaire et al 2019 ) . However , they did not detect changes in the hue or saturation of 118 the gape , which are color parameters linked to tissue carotenoid concentrations 119 ( McGraw 2006 ) . Moreover , the red ketocarotenoids are obtained with food in the 120 seabirds and directly deposited on ornaments without metabolic conversion 121 ( reviewed in McGraw 2006 ) . Tarvin et al . ( 2016 ) performed a similar feather clipping 122 in wild female American goldfinches ( Spinus tristis Linnaeus ) and did not detect bill 123 color change when recaptured three weeks later . However , red ketocarotenoids have 124 still not been described in the bill of this species . Lastly , a fourth study indeed 125 detected a change in the color of a ketocarotenoid - based ornament . Wild male red - 126 backed fairy - wrens ( Malurus melanocephalus Latham ) with clipped wings increased 127 the surface of red plumage after natural molt compared to controls ( Barron et al . , 128 2013 ) , which would agree with Völker ( 1957 ) ’s hypothesis . However , the wing - 129 clipped birds reported better body condition ( inferred from a body fat score ) than 130 controls . The authors thus deduced that the red surface increment was due to lower 131 mobility or higher food intake . The birds could not have endured a higher flying effort . 132 Note that body mass loss is often detected in feather clipping studies ( e . g . Lifjeld and 133 Slagsvold 1988 ; Weimerkirsch et al . , 1995 ; Lind and Jacobson 2001 ; Ardia and 134 Clotfelter 2007 ; Harding et al 2009 ; Leclaire et al 2011 ; Matysiokova and Remes 2011 ; 135 Wegmann et al . , 2015 ; Casagrande and Hau 2018 ) . 136 The present study aims to infer the link between red carotenoid - based 137 ornament expression and flight metabolism by increasing flying effort in wild male 138 common crossbills . In captive males of this species , we have recently described that 139 the treatment with synthetic mito - targeted antioxidant ( mitoTEMPO ) favored the 140 production of a redder plumage ( Cantarero et al . , 2020a ) . We have also found that 141 wild male crossbills lose plumage redness with age , which may suggest a link to 142 senescence and , accordingly , oxidative stress ( Fernández - Eslava et al . , 2021a ) . Redder 143 crossbills also have higher probabilities of being recaptured ( i . e . , a proxy of survival ; 144 Fernández - Eslava et al . , 2021a , b ) , thus linking plumage color to individual fitness . 145 Importantly , we have recently found that redder males have proportionally longer 146 flying feathers , thus probably correlating flying activity to carotenoid conversion 147 ( Fernández - Eslava et al . , under review ; see also Alonso and Arizaga , 2013 ) . 148 We have used the same technique applied in other studies to increase flying 149 effort ( i . e . wing feather clipping ) . We also plucked the rump feathers in all the birds to 150 stimulate plumage regrown in a small surface during a short time - lapse , a method 151 previously used in this species ( i . e . Cantarero et al . , 2020a ) . We measured the rump 152 color just before plucking it and when the birds were recaptured several weeks later . 153 Almost 300 male common crossbills were captured throughout autumn - winter in the 154 same Iberian population . This sample size was needed to obtain a minimum recapture 155 sample allowing comparisons . We assume that our manipulation increased the flying 156 effort . We should note that crossbills are social birds during the winter ( e . g . Benkman 157 1997 ) , clipped individuals being probably forced to increase their energy expenditure 158 to follow the flock . In this regard , the individual body mass change was tested , a body 159 mass loss being predicted in clipped birds but not in controls . In terms of plumage 160 coloration , two alternative predictions can be formulated . First , a higher flying effort 161 reduces plumage redness . This could be expected if wing - feather clipping reduces the 162 capacity to acquire dietary yellow carotenoids or augments oxidative stress , 163 decreasing carotenoid availability to feathers ( e . g . carotenoids being bleached by ROS 164 or consumed as antioxidants ; e . g . Simons et al . , 2012 ; Koch et al . , 2018 ) . A hypothetical 165 flight - related oxidative stress could also directly impair ketolase activity , considering 166 that high ROS levels alter the mitochondrial metabolism ( reviewed in e . g . Barja 2014 ) . 167 Alternatively , the manipulation could increase plumage redness . If joined with a body 168 mass loss , this outcome would agree with a scenario where exercise raises redox rates 169 ( often described in mammals ; e . g . Campos et al . , 2013 ; Park et al . , 2016 ) , favoring 170 carotenoid conversion , such as early envisaged by Völker ( 1957 ) . 171 172 MATERIALS AND METHODS 173 Experimental design 174 The manipulation of free - ranging male crossbills required many captures , allowing to 175 recapture enough experimental and control birds . This was only feasible during 176 autumn and winter when birds group in flocks and crossbill captures rise . In that 177 period , the birds are mostly resident individuals with high recapture probabilities 178 ( Alonso and Arizaga 2011 , 2017 ) . According to this , the manipulation period was 179 performed from October 19 , 2019 , to February 14 , 2020 . This allowed capturing 295 180 adult male crossbills in the same ringing station ( El Royo , Soria , Spain ) throughout 17 181 sampling sessions . All the birds were captured in two 12 long 16 mm mesh mist - nets 182 placed close to sites traditionally used to provide salt for livestock ( Fernandez - Eslava 183 et al . 2020 ) . 184 The captured birds were ringed , and their sex and age EURING code were 185 notated ( based on Jenni and Winkler , 1994 and Svensson , 1998 ) . The minimum age in 186 months was subsequently established based on plumage features following 187 Fernández - Eslava et al . ( 2021a ) . The birds were then weighed ( ±0 . 1 g ) and several 188 biometric variables were measured with a digital caliper . These included the wing 189 length ( ± 0 . 5 mm , method III of Svensson , 1998 ) , tail length ( ± 0 . 5 mm ) , tarsus length 190 ( ± 0 . 01 mm ) and head length ( ± 0 . 01 mm ) . The subcutaneous fat extension and 191 pectoral muscle shape were registered in a visual score ( fat : 0 - 8 , with 0 . 25 subclasses 192 in Kaiser 1993 ; muscle : 0 - 3 scale , in Bairlein 1995 ) and always by the same person 193 ( DA ) . Lastly , a four - level score was used to classify each bird ' s plumage color , and two 194 digital pictures of each individual were taken ( see Color measurements below ) . 195 Birds were then assigned to the control or feather - clipped group . In the latter 196 group , primaries 3 and 5 of each wing ( counting inward from the distal wing margin ) 197 were clipped at the base of the rachis with scissors in feather - clipped males . Control 198 males were similarly handled but without feather clipping . Additionally , the rump 199 feathers of both groups were plucked after taking pictures ( see below ) to stimulate 200 plumage regrown . The group assignation was a priori made randomly . However , we 201 also attempted to balance the treatments regarding the cited plumage color categories 202 and the bird ' s age . Thus , finally , 151 controls and 144 clipped - feather birds were 203 assigned . Only three controls and one clipped bird were ending their wing molt at the 204 time of manipulation ( treatment x molt occurrence : χ 2 = 0 . 92 , df = 1 , p = 0 . 337 ) . 205 Among these four birds , only one control bird was recaptured . The results were 206 similar when excluding these four individuals from the analyses . 207 Recaptures took place from January 2 to July 24 , 2020 . This means that some 208 birds could be recaptured during the period dedicated to treatment assignment and 209 manipulation of other birds . Only those recaptures that took place more than three 210 weeks after the first capture were included in the statistical analyses . This was the 211 minimum period observed to allow birds to regrow their rump feathers fully . Five 212 recaptures produced within less than three weeks were accordingly discarded as the 213 rump was not regrown ( lapse mean ± S . D : 81 ± 9 . 3 d , range 21 - 208 d ) . The first birds 214 showing a natural molt of the rump were found after July 24 . Thus , only the color of 215 the feathers induced by the experimental plucking was analyzed—a full inspection of 216 body plumage from pictures and wing feather molting patterns allowed to verify this . 217 Thirty - four recaptured birds met these criteria ( 20 control and 14 feather - clipped 218 birds ) . The probability of being recaptured did not differ between the two groups 219 tested in the analyses ( χ 2 = 0 . 89 , df = 1 , p = 0 . 344 ) . 220 All the experimental work was approved by the government office in charge of 221 the ethics in animal experiments ( i . e . , Organo Competente Consejeria de Medio 222 Ambiente de la Comunidad de Madrid ; approval ref . PROEX 103 . 4 / 20 ) . 223 224 Color measurements 225 Digital photographs of the breast and the back of red crossbills were always taken by 226 putting the birds at the same position and fixed distance from the objective ( Canon 227 Macro Lens EF 50 mm ; see also Cantarero et al . , 2020a ; see Fig . 1 ) . A Kaiser Repro 228 Base ( Kaiser Fototechnik , Buchen ) was used , including a gridded board and a column 229 to place the camera at the same height ( distance from the board to the lens : 38 cm ) . 230 The base was covered with opaque grey cellular polycarbonate sheets placed 231 vertically to cover the four sides of the board . It allowed us to enter the camera 232 objective and ring flash from the top ( Canon Macro Ring Lite MR - 14EX ) . The sheets 233 were perforated to allow entering the hands of a person that would hold the bird ' s 234 body resting on the board surface . All the open surfaces were covered with PVC 235 blackout fabric to reduce the light on the board surface . The focus and diaphragm of 236 the camera and the ring flash were all manually fixed to avoid the interference of 237 automatic functions . 238 Two digital pictures of each bird were taken ( i . e . one including the breast and 239 abdomen , and another the backside ) . Thus , the bird was placed in face - up or prone 240 positions by pulling the bill and legs . A standard grey card ( Kodak , NY , USA ) was used 241 as a reference , placed next to the bird’s flank on the board surface , and always in the 242 same position . Digital photographs were standardized and analyzed using ‘SpotEgg’ 243 software ( Gómez and Liñán - Cembrano 2017 ) , which allows the user to manually draw 244 any region and provide information about its coloration , size or shape . Areas with 245 disorganized feathers were avoided . For each individual , the average of red , green , 246 and blue components of the colored area of the chest ( 1 ) , the head and back ( 2 ) , and 247 rump ( 3 ) were separately calculated . The rump area in the picture of the first capture 248 was similar to that measured on the new rump and highly correlated ( Pearson’s r = 249 0 . 83 , p < 0 . 001 ) . We then determined each area ' s hue ( º ) , chroma and brightness 250 through the Foley and van Dam ( 1982 ) algorithms . In a previous study on the same 251 species , the repeatability ( Lessells and Boag 1987 ) of these three variables taken 252 twice was very high ( all r > 0 . 90 , n = 30 ; Cantarero et al . , 2020a ) . Finally , since a low 253 hue indicates a redder color , we reversed their values ( i . e . multiplying by - 1 ) to obtain 254 a more intuitive variable , i . e . " redness . " We rescaled the variable by adding the 255 minimum negative value to obtain positive data . Thus , high plumage redness values 256 indicate redder traits ( e . g . Cantarero et al . , 2020a , b ) . The rump hue measures taken 257 from another sample of crossbills reported a high correlation to red ketocarotenoid 258 concentrations in rump feathers ( Supplementary Information ) . 259 In addition , the birds were also classified in one of the four - color categories 260 described by del Val et al . ( 2009b ) , i . e . , yellow , patchy , orange or red . These categories 261 consider the whole body area ( Fernández - Eslava et al . , 2021a ) . This body color score 262 allowed to balance the treatment assignation in terms of individual coloration . The 263 score correlates with objective colorimeter measures ( del Val et al . 2009b ) and is 264 repeatable when assessed twice by the same person ( DA ) naïve to bird identity 265 ( measures separated by one week ; see Cantarero et al . 2020a ) . Moreover , the score 266 also positively correlated with the concentration of red ketocarotenoids in feathers , 267 but not with yellow carotenoid levels ( Supplementary Information ) . 268 269 Statistical analyses 270 The analyses were performed with SPSS version 27 . In the initial capture ( i . e . N = 271 295 ) , the sampling date , minimum age ( i . e . Fernández - Eslava et al . , 2021a ) , and wing , 272 tail , and bill lengths , did not follow a Gaussian distribution ( Shapiro - Wilk tests ) , and 273 arithmetic procedures could not normalize them . Accordingly , treatment comparisons 274 were made by non - parametric Mann - Whitney’s U tests in these variables . The body 275 mass and tarsus length were normally distributed and comparisons were tested by 276 Student ' s t - tests . An ANCOVA model testing initial body mass as dependent , the 277 treatment as a fixed factor , and morphometries as covariates was also performed to 278 test potential biases in size - corrected body mass at the first capture ( only covariate 279 terms at p < 0 . 10 were retained in the model after a backward stepwise procedure ) . 280 In the dataset only including the recaptured birds ( i . e . n = 34 ) , the initial date of 281 capture , number of days elapsed to the recapture and tail length were not normally 282 distributed and compared by Mann - Whitney’s U tests . The initial body mass , body 283 mass change to recapture ( % ) and other morphometries followed a Gaussian 284 distribution and were analyzed by Student’s t - tests . Size - corrected body mass was 285 tested using an ANCOVA , testing body mass as the dependent variable , the treatment 286 as a fixed factor and significant body morphometries as covariates . Also , in this subset , 287 the hue , chroma or brightness at the first or second capture dates , and in any body 288 part , were normally distributed . However , the hue of the rump did not follow a normal 289 distribution , and it could not be normalized by arithmetic transformations , being 290 tested by Mann - Whitney’s U or Wilcoxon matched - pairs tests . Bivariate Spearman’s 291 correlation coefficients were used when at least one of the variables was not normal . 292 In Student’s t - tests , homoscedasticity was analyzed by Levene’s F tests . Two - tailed 293 tests were always used . 294 295 RESULTS 296 Testing potential initial biases 297 Among the initially captured birds , the minimum age in months , initial date of capture 298 and plumage color categories were not significantly biased between treatments 299 ( Mann - Whitney’s U = 10232 , p = 0 . 379 , U = 9804 , p = 0 . 143 and χ 2 = 4 . 78 , df = 4 , p = 300 0 . 310 , respectively ) . Moreover , the wing , tail and bill lengths did not differ ( all MW 301 tests p > 0 . 240 ) and neither the body mass or tarsus length ( t = 0 . 939 , df = 286 , p = 302 0 . 349 and t = 0 . 872 , df = 292 , p = 0 . 384 , respectively ) . Size - corrected body mass was 303 also balanced between treatments at the first capture ( treatment : F 1 , 278 = 0 . 01 , p = 304 0 . 978 ; tarsus length : F 1 , 278 = 19 . 1 , p < 0 . 001 ; wing length : F 1 , 278 = 13 . 8 , p < 0 . 001 ) . 305 Finally , the muscle and fat scores did not differ ( Mann - Whitney’s U , both p > 0 . 80 ) 306 In the subsample of recaptured birds ( i . e . n = 34 ) , no significant difference in 307 rump hue ( redness ) , saturation or brightness was found at the first capture ( U = 119 , 308 p = 0 . 462 , t = - 0 . 93 , df = 32 , p = 0 . 361 and t = 0 . 17 , df = 32 , p = 0 . 863 , respectively ) . 309 Similarly , no color component of any other body region ( i . e . head and back or breast 310 areas ) reported any significant difference between treatments ( all t - tests : p > 0 . 13 ) . 311 Moreover , the minimum age in months , the initial capture date , the number of days 312 elapsed from that date to the recapture , and body morphometries including size - 313 corrected body mass did not significantly differ with treatments in this subset ( all 314 tests p > 0 . 20 ) . Only the initial body mass showed a trend to statistical significance ( t = 315 1 . 75 , df = 32 , p = 0 . 090 ) , with clipped birds tending to be heavier than controls 316 ( means± SD : 38 . 6 ± 1 . 5 g and 37 . 4 ± 2 . 2 g , respectively ) . However , initial body mass 317 did not correlate with rump redness at the first capture or recapture ( Spearman’s r = - 318 0 . 202 , p = 0 . 251 and r = 0 . 08 , p = 0 . 654 , respectively ) . Lastly , muscle and fat scores did 319 not differ ( Mann - Whitney’s U , both p > 0 . 74 ) 320 321 Experimental effects 322 The body mass change ( % ) from the initial to the second capture clearly differed 323 between control and clipped birds ( i . e . t = 2 . 97 , df = 32 , p = 0 . 006 ; Cohen’s d effect size : 324 1 . 04 ; see Fig . 2 ) . Clipped birds lost about 1 . 7 % of their initial body mass ( difference to 325 zero : t = - 3 . 03 , df = 13 , p = 0 . 010 ) , whereas controls showed a statistical trend to 326 increase body mass in a similar proportion ( t = 1 . 96 , df = 19 , p = 0 . 065 ; Fig . 2 ) . The 327 muscle score at recapture ranged from 1 to 3 in the 0 - 3 scale , and did not differ 328 between treatments : U = 91 , p = 0 . 236 ) . The subcutaneous fat score did not show 329 variability , being untested ( always a 0 . 5 - value , small stripe into the furcular 330 depression ) . 331 The redness of the rump strongly declined from the first to the second capture 332 ( Fig . 3 ; Z = - 3 . 92 , p < 0 . 001 and Z = - 2 . 79 , p < 0 . 001 ; Wilcoxon matched - pairs tests for 333 control and clipped birds , respectively ) . The redness of the regrown rump redness 334 was uncorrelated to the original value ( Spearman’s r = 0 . 126 , p = 0 . 477 ) . This could be 335 due to reduced redness variability ( SD dropped from 5 . 95 to 2 . 98 ) and the 336 experimental effect ( Fig . 3 ) . Thus , a positive correlation seems to arise among controls 337 but not in clipped birds ( r = 0 . 395 , p = 0 . 085 and r = - 0 . 125 , p = 0 . 669 , respectively ) . 338 Despite the evident color decline and lack of within - individual correlation , the redness 339 of the new regrown feathers significantly differed between treatments ( U = 80 . 5 , p = 340 0 . 037 ) , with clipped birds developing a redder rump than controls ( Fig . 3 ) . 341 342 DISCUSSION 343 Here , male crossbills with experimentally impaired flying capacity and , probably , 344 obligated to alter their metabolism ( Fig . 1 ) produced redder feathers than controls 345 ( Fig . 2 and 3 ) . The red coloration of male common crossbills is due to the 346 accumulation of red ketocarotenoids ( mainly 3 - hydroxyechinenone ) in feathers , 347 which requires enzymatic oxidation ( ketolation ) of yellow dietary carotenoids ( del Val 348 et al . , 2009a ; Cantarero et al . , 2020a ) . Thus , the main result mostly supports the 349 hypothesis that flying effort influences carotenoid conversion . 350 Control male crossbills tended to gain weight during the study ( Fig . 1 ) . 351 Increased body mass and fat reserves from winter to spring have been documented in 352 captive and wild common crossbills from North America ( Hahn 1995 ; Cornelius and 353 Hahn 2012 ) , but this effect was non - significant in North Spanish populations ( i . e . 354 Alonso and Arizaga 2011 ) . In contrast to controls , clipped crossbills lost body mass . A 355 body mass loss of males wing clipped during the breeding period has been reported in 356 many species and mostly interpreted as a consequence of increased flying effort due 357 to reduced lift ( e . g . Lifjeld and Slagsvold 1988 ; Weimerkirsch et al . , 1995 ; Harding et 358 al . , 2009 ; Leclaire et al 2011 ; Wegmann et al . , 2015 ; Casagrande and Hau 2018 ) . 359 Reduced body mass was also detected in captive wing - clipped tree sparrows ( Passer 360 montanus Linnaeus ) during their molt , pectoral muscles increasing mass probably due 361 to higher flight activity ( Lind and Jacobson 2001 ) . Here , fat and muscle scores did not 362 provide any clue , but they reported low variability and were probably insensitive to 363 subtle changes . 364 Alternatively , the clipped birds could have reduced body mass to compensate 365 for the high flying cost imposed by increased wing loading . Compensatory body mass 366 loss has mostly been described during the nestling - feeding period and interpreted as 367 a way to optimize foraging efficiency ( e . g . Moreno 1989 ; Merkle and Barclay 1996 ; 368 Slagsvold and Johansen 1998 ; but see also Lind and Jacobson 2001 ) . Crossbills have 369 the main breeding peak between February and March ( Alonso and Arizaga 2011 ) . 370 Unfortunately , we did not know the reproductive status of each bird . Nonetheless , at 371 first capture , a rough index of active reproduction ( i . e . cloacal protuberance 372 occurrence ; Schut et al . , 2012 ) was registered . Among the recaptured birds , it showed 373 high incidence ( 28 / 34 : 82 % ) and equal distribution between both treatments ( χ 2 = 374 0 . 23 , df = 1 , p = 0 . 628 ) . Therefore , we cannot infer that clipped individuals were 375 engaged in different body mass regulation , although it cannot be fully discarded . 376 However , we should note that a programmed body mass loss should involve reduced 377 food intake ( i . e . programmed anorexia ; Jones 1994 ) , probably constraining carotenoid 378 ingestion and limiting pigment conversion . Thus , in our view , the most parsimonious 379 interpretation of reduced body mass in clipped birds is that it was indeed a 380 consequence of higher energy consumption to face flying effort . 381 Interestingly , the redness value of the new rump was approximately three 382 times lower than that found at the first capture ( Fig . 2 ) . The birds were only able to 383 regrown yellowish to orange feathers . We propose three non - excluding explanations . 384 First , birds were mostly captured out of the molting season ( see Alonso and Arizaga 385 2011 ; Fernández - Eslava et al . , 2019 ) . The natural molt involves a specific endocrine 386 profile in birds ( reviewed in Dawson 2015 ) , and hormones could have constrained 387 carotenoid conversion . For instance , high thyroid hormone levels are involved in 388 avian molt activation ( Gulde et al . 2009 ; Dawson 2015 ; Pérez et al . , 2018 ) . In captive 389 male zebra finches ( Taeniopygia guttata Vieillot ) , a triiodothyronine ( T3 ) treatment 390 triggered the molt of body feathers ( Cantarero et al . , 2020b ) . Simultaneously , the bill 391 redness of these birds ( a red - ketocarotenoid - based trait ; McGraw and Toomey 2010 ) 392 was affected by the interaction of a mitochondria - targeted antioxidant ( mitoTEMPO ) 393 treatment and T3 dosage ( Cantarero et al . , 2020b ) . Thus , although the carotenoid - 394 based ornament of zebra finches is not a plumage trait , the result suggests that the 395 mitochondrial function could require a certain endocrine profile to favor pigment 396 conversion . Second , low autumn - winter temperatures could affect redox metabolism . 397 Low winter temperatures increase oxygen consumption and heart rates in common 398 crossbills ( Dawson and Tordoff 1964 ; Draud 2019 ) . A different metabolism could then 399 force a trade - off favoring survival over color expression , perhaps biasing 400 mitochondrial metabolism from cell respiration linked to carotenoid conversion to 401 heat production . Nonetheless , such a mitochondrial uncoupling is still unclear in birds 402 ( e . g . Walter and Seebacher 2009 ; Teulier 2010 ; Salin et al . , 2015 ) . Third , a low 403 availability of dietary substrate carotenoids during winter could have limited 404 carotenoid transformation . In male American redstart ( Setophaga ruticilla Linnaeus ) , 405 a hypothetical scarcity of carotenoids in food was also argued when interpreting 406 decreased red chroma detected in a tail feather plucked and regrown during winter 407 ( Tonra et el . 2014 ) . Moreover , in another close - related crossbill ( i . e . Loxia leucoptera 408 Gmelin ) , circulating β - cryptoxanthin levels ( substrate for red ketocarotenoids in 409 common crossbills ; del Val et al . , 2009a ; Cantarero et al . , 2020a ) decrease out of the 410 molting months , suggesting a decline in the availability of dietary sources of pigments 411 ( Deviche et al . , 2008 ) . 412 Whatever the factors constraining carotenoid conversion during the study , the 413 new regrown plumage produced enough color variability to detect a significant 414 experimental effect ( Fig . 2 ) . Contrarily to the prediction that increased flying effort 415 could constrain carotenoid acquisition or impair redox transformations due to higher 416 oxidative damage , leading to less red plumage , clipped crossbills produced redder ( or 417 more orange ) feathers than controls . We highlight that , in a similarly short color range 418 ( yellow to orange ) derived from a plucking experiment under captivity ( Cantarero et 419 al . , 2020a ) , a positive correlation ( Spearman’s r = 0 . 53 ) between crossbill rump 420 redness and feather red ketocarotenoid concentration was detected ( also 421 Supplementary information ) . This suggests that the effect found here was indeed due 422 to a higher activity of oxidase enzymes in charge of carotenoid biosynthesis ( i . e . 423 ketolases ; e . g . Lopes et al . , 2016 ) among wing - clipped birds . Thus , the result seems to 424 support a link between flight - related metabolism and carotenoid conversion . At first 425 glance , it coincides with Barron et al . ( 2013 ) ’s study where wing - clipped male red - 426 backed fairy - wrens produced larger red plumage areas than controls ( the red color is 427 also due to ketocarotenoids in this species ; Rowe and McGraw 2008 ) . Their analyses 428 focused on recaptured birds ( ten controls and ten clipped birds ) , surprisingly finding 429 that only control birds lost body fat during the study ( Barron et al . , 2013 ) . The authors 430 attributed this to reduced activity or more time to acquire carotenoids , but not to 431 higher flight effort . A link to flying metabolism was , thus , not considered . Moreover , 432 the study did not report the number or characteristics of all the wrens initially 433 manipulated or used as controls , potential biases or differential recovery rates being 434 untested . 435 In the context of animal signaling theory , our result may suggest that common 436 crossbill coloration could inform signal receptors about the intrinsic quality of the 437 bearer in terms of cell metabolism ( i . e . Hill 2011 ; Hill et al . , 2019 ) . However , it could 438 also reveal a general phenotypic profile , including the flying capacity and other 439 correlated traits linked to fitness . In this line , Chui et al . , ( 2011 ) found that male 440 golden - crowned kinglets ( Regulus satrapa Lichtenstein ) with redder crowns colored 441 by ketocarotenoids left for migration earlier than yellow - crowned individuals , 442 probably allowing early reproduction in breeding grounds and better reproductive 443 success ( e . g . Potti 1998 ) . In the same line , Mateos - Gonzalez et al . , ( 2014 ) found that 444 redder male house finches ( Haemorhus mexicanus Müller ) were better able to escape 445 from capture into the aviaries than yellowish birds , suggesting that red birds are 446 better at avoiding predation . Note that the house finch plumage is colored by the same 447 red transformed ketocarotenoid ( 3 - hydroxy - echinenone ) that male common 448 crossbills deposit on their plumage ( McGraw 2006 ; Del Val et al . , 2009a ; Cantarero et 449 al . , 2020a ) . Moreover , we have recently found that redder male crossbills have 450 proportionally longer flight feathers than yellow birds ( Fernández - Eslava et al . , under 451 review ; see also Alonso and Arizaga , 2013 ) and more probabilities of being recaptured 452 in the wild ( an index of survival and , hence , of individual quality ; Fernández - Eslava et 453 al . , 2021a , b ) . 454 In summary , the flying effort seems to favor carotenoid conversion and the 455 production of redder plumage in male common crossbills . This is an experimental 456 approach forcing all the clipped birds to afford the challenge during a relatively short 457 time - lapse ( a few weeks ) . Natural covariation between carotenoid - conversion rates , 458 coloration and flying capacity could have evolved so that the ornament might reveal a 459 general phenotypic profile including a certain flight - related metabolism . To confirm 460 this , more correlational and experimental studies in free - ranging birds captured must 461 be performed . Moreover , future work in this or similar animal models should 462 specifically focus on cell respiration metabolism and ketolase activity rates during the 463 trait development . 464 465 466 Acknowledgements 467 We acknowledge the personnel of the Autonomous region government Comunidad de 468 Castilla Leon ( Spain ) for authorizing the captures in the Sorian crossbill population . 469 470 Competing interest 471 No competing interest is declared . 472 473 Funding . 474 The study was partially funded by Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación ( project ref . 475 PID2019 - 109303GBI00 , MCIN / AEI / 10 . 13039 / 501100011033 ) . 476 477 Data availability 478 Data will be available at DIGITAL .
