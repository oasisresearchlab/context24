NIHR Health Technology Assessment programme T he Health Technology Assessment ( HTA ) programme , part of the National Institute for Health Research ( NIHR ) , was set up in 1993 . It produces high - quality research information on the effectiveness , costs and broader impact of health technologies for those who use , manage and provide care in the NHS . ‘Health technologies’ are broadly defined as all interventions used to promote health , prevent and treat disease , and improve rehabilitation and long - term care . The research findings from the HTA programme directly influence decision - making bodies such as the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) and the National Screening Committee ( NSC ) . HTA findings also help to improve the quality of clinical practice in the NHS indirectly in that they form a key component of the ‘National Knowledge Service’ . The HTA programme is needs led in that it fills gaps in the evidence needed by the NHS . There are three routes to the start of projects . First is the commissioned route . Suggestions for research are actively sought from people working in the NHS , from the public and consumer groups and from professional bodies such as royal colleges and NHS trusts . These suggestions are carefully prioritised by panels of independent experts ( including NHS service users ) . The HTA programme then commissions the research by competitive tender . Second , the HTA programme provides grants for clinical trials for researchers who identify research questions . These are assessed for importance to patients and the NHS , and scientific rigour . Third , through its Technology Assessment Report ( TAR ) call - off contract , the HTA programme commissions bespoke reports , principally for NICE , but also for other policy - makers . TARs bring together evidence on the value of specific technologies . Some HTA research projects , including TARs , may take only months , others need several years . They can cost from as little as £40 , 000 to over £1 million , and may involve synthesising existing evidence , undertaking a trial , or other research collecting new data to answer a research problem . The final reports from HTA projects are peer reviewed by a number of independent expert referees before publication in the widely read journal series Health Technology Assessment . Criteria for inclusion in the HTA journal series Reports are published in the HTA journal series if ( 1 ) they have resulted from work for the HTA programme , and ( 2 ) they are of a sufficiently high scientific quality as assessed by the referees and editors . Reviews in Health Technology Assessment are termed ‘systematic’ when the account of the search , appraisal and synthesis methods ( to minimise biases and random errors ) would , in theory , permit the replication of the review by others . The research reported in this issue of the journal was commissioned by the National Coordinating Centre for Research Methodology ( NCCRM ) , and was formally transferred to the HTA programme in April 2007 under the newly established NIHR Methodology Panel . The HTA programme project number is 06 / 92 / 02 . The contractual start date was in October 2007 . The draft report began editorial review in November 2008 and was accepted for publication in June 2009 . The commissioning brief was devised by the NCCRM who specified the research question and study design . The authors have been wholly responsible for all data collection , analysis and interpretation , and for writing up their work .

Data sources : The main literature search , in August 2008 , covered the Cochrane Methodology Register Database , MEDLINE , EMBASE , AMED and CINAHL . In May 2009 , PubMed , PsycINFO and OpenSIGLE were also searched . Reference lists of retrieved studies were also examined . Review methods : In Part I , studies were classified as evidence or method studies and data were extracted according to types of dissemination bias or methods for dealing with it . Evidence from empirical studies was summarised narratively . In Part II , 300 systematic reviews were randomly selected from MEDLINE and the methods used to deal with publication and related biases were assessed . Results : Studies with significant or positive results were more likely to be published than those with non - significant or negative results , thereby confirming findings from a previous HTA report . There was convincing evidence that outcome reporting bias exists and has an impact on the pooled summary in systematic reviews . Studies with significant results tended to be published earlier than studies with non - significant results , and empirical evidence suggests that published studies tended to report a greater treatment effect than those from the grey literature . Exclusion of non - English - language studies appeared to result in a high risk of bias in some areas of research such as complementary and alternative medicine . In a few cases , publication and related biases had a potentially detrimental impact on patients or resource use . Publication bias can be prevented before a literature review ( e . g . by prospective registration of trials ) , or detected during a literature review ( e . g . by locating unpublished studies , funnel plot and related tests , sensitivity analysis modelling ) , or its impact can be minimised after a literature review ( e . g . by confirmatory large - scale trials , updating the systematic review ) . The interpretation of funnel plot and related statistical tests , often used to assess publication bias , was often too simplistic and likely misleading . More sophisticated modelling methods have not been widely used . Compared with systematic reviews published in 1996 , recent reviews of health - care interventions were more likely to locate and include non - English - language studies and grey literature or unpublished studies , and to test for publication bias . Conclusions : Dissemination of research findings is likely to be a biased process , although the actual impact of such bias depends on specific circumstances . The prospective registration of clinical trials and the endorsement of reporting guidelines may reduce research dissemination bias in clinical research . In systematic reviews , measures can be taken to minimise the impact of dissemination bias by systematically searching for and including relevant studies that are difficult to access . Statistical methods can be useful for sensitivity analyses . Further research is needed to develop methods for qualitatively assessing the risk of publication bias in systematic reviews , and to evaluate the effect of prospective registration of studies , open access policy and improved publication guidelines .

All rights reserved . ix Background The validity of research synthesis is threatened if studies with significant or striking findings are more likely to be published than those with non - significant results . A previous Health Technology Assessment ( HTA ) monograph published in 2000 by the present authors reviewed studies on publication and related biases . Since then , many new studies on publication and related biases have been published . This report aims to update the 2000 HTA monograph on publication bias by synthesising findings from previous studies and newly indentified ones . Objectives • To identify and appraise empirical studies on publication and related biases published since 1998 . • To assess the usefulness and limitations of available methods to deal with publication and related biases . • To examine in a random sample of published systematic reviews , measures taken by the authors to prevent , reduce and detect different types of dissemination bias . Methods Part I : Review of evidence and method studies Study selection The report included evidence studies that provided empirical evidence on the existence , consequences , causes and / or risk factors of dissemination bias ; and method studies that developed or evaluated methods for preventing , reducing or detecting dissemination bias . Data sources The following electronic databases were searched : Cochrane Methodology Register Database ( CMRD ) , MEDLINE , EMBASE , AMED and CINAHL . The main literature search was conducted in August 2008 and a final search of PubMed , PsycINFO and OpenSIGLE was conducted in May 2009 to identify more recently published studies . We also examined reference lists of retrieved studies . Data extraction and synthesis The identified studies were classified by one reviewer as evidence or method studies and checked by a second reviewer . One reviewer extracted data directly into tables ( specifically designed according to types of bias or methods ) , which were checked by a second reviewer . Evidence from empirical studies was summarised narratively . Where appropriate , the results have been quantitatively pooled . Part II : Survey of published systematic reviews We searched MEDLINE for systematic reviews published in 2006 , and randomly selected 100 reviews of effects of health - care interventions , 50 reviews of diagnostic accuracy , 100 reviews of association between risk factors and health outcomes , and 50 reviews of gene - disease associations . We assessed the methods used to deal with publication and related biases in these systematic reviews . Results Empirical evidence on dissemination bias Updated analyses of data from cohort studies confirmed findings from the previous HTA report that studies with significant or positive results are more likely to be published than those with non - significant or negative results . Publication bias occurs mainly before the presentation of findings at conferences and before the submission of manuscripts to journals . Recent high - quality studies have provided convincing evidence that outcome reporting bias exists and has an important impact on the pooled summary in systematic reviews . Studies with significant results tend on average to be published earlier than studies with non - significant results , although the new evidence is less clear than that from the previous review . New empirical evidence suggests that published studies tend to report a greater treatment effect than those Executive summary Executive summary x from grey literature . However , for individual cases , the direction of bias is unpredictable , and grey literature studies may be relatively small and of poor quality . The impact of non - English language studies was highly heterogeneous . Exclusion of non - English language studies appears to result in a particularly high risk of bias in some areas of research such as complementary and alternative medicine . The updated review also identified limited evidence on citation bias , duplicate publication bias , place of publication bias , database or index bias , country bias and media attention bias . Limitations of the available evidence Empirical studies on publication and related biases have focused mainly on certain areas of research such as clinical trials of health - care interventions . When studies are classified as positive or important , bias may be introduced due to inevitable subjectivity . Much of the empirical evidence comes from case reports , which may be selectively reported because of their striking findings . Cohort studies often included studies that were diverse in terms of design and research questions . It is usually impossible to exclude the impact of confounding factors on the observed association between study results and publication status . Consequences of research dissemination bias The most important consequences of publication bias include avoidable suffering of patients and waste of limited resources . This updated review identified only a few new cases that indicate the detrimental impact of publication and related biases . Consequences of publication and related biases are different for different types of research studies . Dissemination bias can jeopardise the integrity of scientific research . Sources of publication bias The dissemination profile of a research finding is determined by the interests of research sponsors , investigators , peer - reviewers and editors . The updated review identified further evidence indicating that publication bias is often due to investigators’ failure to write up and submit , although it should be recognised that the investigators’ decision to write up an article and then submit it may be affected by pressure from research sponsors , preferences of journal editors , and the requirements of the research award system . Newly identified and previous included evidence suggested that the interests of research sponsors , particularly industry’s commercial interests , can restrict the dissemination of the research findings . Studies that can be conducted without the use of large amounts of resource investment , and those that are of great variations in results are more subject to publication bias . Methods to prevent , reduce or detect publication and related bias The available methods can be classified according to the stage of a literature review : to prevent publication bias before a literature review ( e . g . prospective registration of trials ) , to detect publication bias during a literature review ( e . g . locating unpublished studies , funnel plot and related tests , sensitivity analysis modelling ) , or to minimise the impact of publication bias after a literature review ( e . g . confirmatory large - scale trials , updating the systematic review ) . The first step for the prevention of publication bias is a wide public awareness of detrimental consequences of publication bias , and the need for the results of all studies to be made accessible . One important solution to publication bias is the prospective registration of all studies at inception . The compulsory policy of trial registration adopted by the International Committee of Medical Journals in 2004 may be the most influential initiative so far to promote prospective registration of clinical trials . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) initiated a project in 2005 to set international standards for clinical trial registration . Further action through government regulations ( e . g . the FDA Modernisation Act in the USA ) may still be required . In spite of the greater risk of publication bias , the prospective registration and disclosure of data from unpublished basic research , observational studies and early stage exploratory trials has faced considerable difficulties . The development of prospective trial registration itself is not sufficient for the prevention of publication bias . It is important to make sure that results of registered trials are publically accessible . The usefulness of trial registrations relies on systematic reviewers searching them , using the data they provide and spending time contacting trialists where studies have not yet been published . The recent development of clinical trial registration and electronic publication of results from clinical DOI : 10 . 3310 / hta14080 Health Technology Assessment 2010 ; Vol . 14 : No . 8 © 2010 Queen’s Printer and Controller of HMSO . All rights reserved . xi trials will facilitate the identification and location of ongoing or unpublished clinical trials . Funnel plot and related statistical tests have been widely used to assess publication bias . Unfortunately , the interpretation of results of funnel plot tests was often too simplistic and likely misleading . Many sophisticated modelling methods have not been widely used in systematic reviews , possibly because of their complexity and lack of user friendly software . Survey of published systematic reviews Compared with systematic reviews published in 1996 , recent systematic reviews of health - care interventions are making greater efforts to locate and include non - English language studies ( 47 % versus 30 % ) , and grey literature or unpublished studies ( 53 % versus 35 % ) . There was also an increased use of available methods to test for publication bias in recent reviews ( 22 % versus 17 % ) . Grey literature , unpublished studies or non - English language studies were more likely to be searched for in reviews of treatment efficacy or diagnostic accuracy than in reviews of epidemiological studies . However , the risk of publication bias was less likely to be tested in reviews of treatment and diagnosis as compared with reviews of epidemiological studies . Conclusions Dissemination of research findings is likely to be a biased process , although the actual impact of such bias is still uncertain , depending on specific circumstances . Therefore , the potential problem of research dissemination bias should be taken into consideration by all who are involved in evidence - based decision making . The recent initiatives in the prospective registration of clinical trials and the endorsement of reporting guidelines may prevent or reduce publication and reporting bias in future systematic reviews of clinical trials , although prospective registration of basic research , early stage clinical studies and observational studies is still underdeveloped . However , trial registers will only be helpful in reducing publication bias if the results of registered trials are accessible . In systematic reviews , measures can be taken to minimise the impact of research dissemination bias by systematically searching for published and unpublished studies . All statistical methods , simple or complex , are by nature indirect and exploratory , and are often based on certain assumptions that can be difficult to justify . The available statistical methods can be useful for the purpose of sensitivity analyses . Recommendations for future research • Further empirical research is needed to evaluate the effect of prospective registration of studies , open access policy and improved publication guidelines in the prevention of research dissemination bias . • The role of developments in computer science and information technology for the prevention of research dissemination bias needs to be investigated by further research . • The impact of publication bias on health decision - making and the outcomes of patient management need to be investigated by further research . • Methods that can be used to assess qualitatively the risk of publication bias in systematic reviews need to be developed by further research . • Further research should focus on the practical application of the available statistical methods .

However , the validity of research synthesis based on published literature will be threatened if published studies comprise a biased selection of all studies that have been conducted . 1 A previous Health Technology Assessment ( HTA ) monograph published in 2000 comprehensively reviewed studies that provided empirical evidence of publication and related biases , and studies that developed or tested methods for preventing , reducing or detecting publication and related biases . 2 The review found evidence indicating that studies with significant or favourable results were more likely to be published , or were likely to be published earlier than those with non - significant or unimportant results . There was limited and indirect evidence indicating the possibility of full publication bias , outcome reporting bias , duplicate publication bias , and language bias . The review identified little empirical evidence relating to the impact of publication and related biases on health policy , clinical decision - making and the outcome of patient management . Considering that the spectrum of the accessibility of research results ( dissemination profile ) ranges from completely inaccessible to easily accessible , it was suggested that a single term , ‘dissemination bias’ , could be used to denote all types of publication and related biases . 2 In the previous HTA report published in 2000 , the available methods for dealing with dissemination biases were classified according to measures that could be taken before , during or after a literature review : to prevent publication bias before a literature review ( e . g . prospective registration of trials ) , to reduce or detect publication and related biases during a literature review ( e . g . locating grey literature or unpublished studies , and funnel plot related methods ) , and to minimise the impact of publication bias after a literature review ( e . g . confirmatory large - scale trials , updating systematic reviews ) . 2 It was concluded that the ideal solution to publication bias is the prospective , universal registration of all studies at their inception . It was also concluded , although debatable , that available statistical methods for detecting and adjusting publication bias should be mainly used for the purpose of sensitivity analysis . 2 Since the publication of the 2000 HTA report on publication bias , many new empirical studies on publication and related biases have been completed and published . For example , Egger et al . ( 2003 ) provided further empirical evidence on publication bias , language bias , grey literature bias and MEDLINE index bias , 3 and Moher et al . ( 2003 ) evaluated language bias in meta - analyses of randomised controlled trials . 4 Recently , more convincing evidence on outcome reporting bias has been published . 5 – 7 The new empirical evidence may contradict or strengthen the empirical evidence included in the previous HTA report . There are also some new published studies that investigated methods for dealing with publication bias ( e . g . references 8 and 9 ) . More importantly , perhaps , new initiatives have been introduced to enhance the prospective registration of clinical trials . 10 This report aims to update the 2000 HTA report on publication bias , by incorporating findings from newly identified studies . We first discuss the concepts and definitions about publication and related biases in this chapter . After a description of review objectives and methods in Chapter 2 , evidence from empirical studies on the existence and consequences of publication bias is summarised in Chapters 3 to 5 . We discuss sources of publication bias in Chapter 6 , while methods for dealing with publication bias are examined in Chapters 7 and 8 . The results of a survey of systematic reviews published in 2006 are presented in Chapter 9 . Finally , the major findings of this updated review are discussed in Chapter 10 . Definition of publication and related biases The observation that many studies are never published was termed ‘the file - drawer problem’ by Rosenthal in 1979 . 11 The importance of this problem depends on whether or not the published studies are representative of all studies that have Chapter 1 Introduction Introduction 2 been conducted . If the published studies are the same as , or a random sample of , all studies that have been conducted , there will be no bias and the average estimate based on the published studies will be similar to that based on all studies . If the published studies comprise a biased sample of all studies that have been conducted , the results of a literature review will be misleading . 12 The efficacy of a treatment will be exaggerated if studies with positive results are more likely to be published than those with negative results . Publication bias is specifically defined as ‘the tendency on the parts of investigators , reviewers , and editors to submit or accept manuscripts for publication based on the direction or strength of the study findings’ . 13 In the definition of publication bias , there are two basic concepts : study findings and publication status . Study findings are commonly classified as being statistically significant or non - significant . In addition , study results may be classified as being positive or negative , supportive or unsupportive , favoured or disliked , striking or unimportant . It should be noted that the classification of study findings is often dependent on subjective judgement and may be unreliable . For example , people may have a different understanding about what are positive or negative findings . The formats of publication include full publication in journals , presentation at scientific conferences , reports , book chapters , discussion papers , dissertations or theses . In fact , ‘publication is not a dichotomous event : rather it is a continuum’ . 14 Although a study that appears in a full report in a journal is generally regarded as published , there may be different opinions about whether it should be classified as published or unpublished when results are presented in other formats . The accessibility of research results is dependent not only on whether a study is published but also on when , where and in what format this occurs . In the 2000 HTA report on publication bias , we used the term ‘dissemination profile’ to describe the accessibility of research results , or the possibility of research findings being identified by potential users . The spectrum of the dissemination profile ranges from completely inaccessible to easily accessible , according to whether , when , where and how research is presented or stored . Dissemination bias occurs when the dissemination profile of a study is determined by its results . The term dissemination bias could be used to embrace publication bias and other related biases caused by time , type and language of publication , multiple publication , selective citation , database index , and biased media attention ( see Box 1 for definitions ) . The advantages of the term ‘dissemination bias’ are that it avoids the need to define publication status and it is more directly related to accessibility than publication . For example , media attention can have a major impact on dissemination , but it is not normally included within the definition of publication bias . Along with the development of information technology and changes in regulations and policy , data from some ‘unpublished’ studies may be conveniently accessible to the public , and formal publication in journals is only one of several ways to disseminate research findings . Therefore , dissemination bias is a better expression to replace this broad use of the term publication bias . However , the term ‘publication bias’ and ‘publication and related biases’ are already established in research literature and they will also be used for discussion in this report .

The dis - semination profile is defined as the accessibility of research results or the possibility of research findings being identified by potential users . The spectrum of the dissemination profile ranges from completely inaccessible to easily accessible , ac - cording to whether , when , where and how research is published . Publication bias Occurs when the publication of research results depends on the nature and direction of the results . Because of publica - tion bias , the results of published studies may be systematically different from those of unpublished studies . outcome reporting bias Occurs when a study in which multiple outcomes were measured reports only those that were significant . Time lag bias Occurs when the speed of publication depends on the direction and strength of the trial results . For example , studies with significant results may be published earlier than those with non - significant results . Grey literature bias Occurs when the results reported in journal articles are systematically different from those presented in reports , working papers , dissertations or conference abstracts . Full publication bias Occurs when the full publication of studies that have been initially presented at conferences or in other informal formats is dependent on the direction and / or strength of their findings . Language bias Occurs when languages of publication depend on the direction and strength of the study results . Multiple publication bias ( duplicate publication bias ) Occurs when studies with significant or supportive results are more likely to generate multiple publications than studies with non - significant or unsupportive results . Duplicate publication can be classified as ‘overt’ or ‘covert’ . Multiple publica - tion bias is particularly difficult to detect if it is covert , when the same data are published in different places or at different times without providing sufficient information about previous or simultaneous publication . Place of publication bias In this review , this is defined as occurring when the place of publication is associated with the direction or strength of the study findings . For example , studies with positive results may be more likely to be published in widely circulated journals than studies with negative results . The term was originally used to describe the tendency for a journal to be more enthu - siastic towards publishing articles about a given hypothesis than other journals , for reasons of editorial policy or readers’ preference . Citation bias Occurs when the chance of a study being cited by others is associated with its result . For example , authors of published articles may tend to cite studies that support their position . Thus , retrieving literature by scanning reference lists may pro - duce a biased sample of articles and reference bias may also render the conclusions of an article less reliable . Database bias ( indexing bias ) Occurs when there is biased indexing of published studies in literature databases . A literature database , such as MEDLINE or EMBASE , may not include and index all published studies on a topic . The literature search will be biased when it is based on a database in which the results of indexed studies are systematically different from those of non - indexed studies . Media attention bias Occurs when studies with striking results are more likely to be covered by the media ( newspapers , radio and television news ) .

Objectives 1 . To identify relevant evidence studies published since 1998 . Evidence studies are defined as those that provide empirical evidence on the existence , consequences , causes and risk factors of dissemination bias . 2 . To identify relevant method studies published since 1998 . Method studies are those that have developed or investigated methods for preventing , reducing or detecting dissemination bias . 3 . To categorise evidence and method studies identified according to a conceptual framework of dissemination profile , and to critically appraise studies that provided direct empirical evidence . 4 . To synthesise findings from newly identified and previously included studies to enable us to assess whether each type of dissemination bias does exist , and if so the extent of the effect that it may have on results of systematic reviews and hence decision - making . 5 . To assess the usefulness and limitations of available methods through synthesis of the methodological studies . 6 . To examine measures taken in a representative sample of published systematic reviews to prevent , reduce and detect different types of dissemination bias . We included both narrative and quantitative ( meta - analytic ) systematic reviews that evaluated effect of health - care interventions , systematic reviews that evaluated the accuracy of diagnostic tests , systematic reviews that evaluated association between genes and disease , and systematic reviews of epidemiological studies that evaluated association of risk factors and health outcomes . 7 . To bring together current evidence on the existence and scale of each type of dissemination bias , effects of methods to combat these biases , and current use of these methods to create recommendations for reviewers , policy - makers and health professionals . Review of empirical and methodological studies Criteria for inclusion We included studies that provide empirical evidence on the existence , consequences , causes and / or risk factors of types of dissemination bias ; and method studies that develop or evaluate methods for preventing , reducing or detecting dissemination bias in biomedical or health - related research . Evidence studies are those that provided empirical evidence on the existence , consequences , causes and risk factors of types of dissemination bias ; and method studies are those whose main objectives involved one of the following : to develop or evaluate methods for preventing , reducing or detecting dissemination bias . In some cases , a study may be considered as both an evidence study and a method study . Literature search strategy The following health - related or biomedical bibliographic databases were searched to identify relevant studies pertaining to empirical evidence and methodological issues concerning publication and related biases : MEDLINE , the Cochrane Methodology Register Database ( CMRD ) , EMBASE , AMED and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature ( CINAHL ) . The strategies used to search these electronic databases are presented in Appendix 1 . The period searched was from 1998 to August 2008 . A further search of PubMed ( from 2008 to 2009 ) , PsycINFO ( from 1998 to 2009 ) , and OpenSIGLE ( from 1998 to 2009 ) was carried out in May 2009 by one reviewer to identify relevantly published or grey literature studies . References ( titles with or without abstracts ) gathered by searching MEDLINE and CMRD were independently examined by two reviewers . References from other databases were Chapter 2 Review objectives and methods Review objectives and methods 6 assessed by one reviewer because they were mostly duplicates of those from MEDLINE . Literature searches for methodological studies are often difficult because of ill - defined boundaries and inappropriate indexing in commonly used bibliographic databases . 15 In addition , a large number of relevant issues need to be considered in this methodological review . It is hence possible that many relevant studies may be missed by formal searches of electronic databases . Therefore , an iterative approach for literature search was adopted by examining the reference lists of retrieved studies , and examining citations of identified key studies , to identify additional relevant studies . A more focused search of databases was also conducted during the review of specific issues . Classification of identified relevant studies According to findings from the previous HTA report , 2 the relevant evidence and method studies were numerous in quantity and substantially diverse in quality . To facilitate subsequent assessment and synthesis , identified studies were classified according to a framework of study classification ( Figure 1 ) . The identified studies were initially classified by one reviewer as evidence or method studies . Empirical evidence studies were further subcategorised into various types of dissemination bias according to a framework of dissemination profile : non - publication ( never or delayed ) ; incomplete publication ( outcome reporting or abstract bias ) ; limited accessibility to publication ( grey literature , language or database bias ) ; other biased dissemination ( citation , duplicate or media attention bias ) . Some studies were included in more than one category . The evidence studies were separated into two groups – direct and indirect evidence studies . Direct evidence referred to findings that could be used directly to indicate dissemination bias , including admissions of bias on the part of those involved in the publication process , comparison of the results of published and unpublished studies , and the prospective and retrospective follow - up Cactus Design and Illustration Ltd Figure Number : 00 . 01 . ai Title : 06 - 92 - 02 Proof Stage : 2 Evidence studies – Existence – Consequences – Causes Method studies Stage of literature review Pre During Post Other Studies identified Non - publication : – Publication bias – Time delay bias Incomplete publication : – Outcome reporting – Abstract bias Limited accessibility : – Grey literature bias – Language bias – Database bia Other biased dissemination : – Citation bias – Duplicate bias – Media attention bias – Prospective study registration – Research publication policy and process : journal editorial and peer reviewing process , electronic publications – Comprehensive literature search – Funnel plot and related methods – Other statistical and modelling methods – Updating systematic reviews Any other methods / approaches – Confirmatory studies – Updating systematic reviews – Scepticism about research findings FiGure 1 Classification of identified relevant studies on publication and related biases .

Indirect evidence referred to findings that could presumably have some relation with dissemination bias but where other alternative explanations could not be completely excluded . The availability of empirical evidence is very different for different types of research dissemination bias . This updated review focused on direct evidence , although indirect evidence was also considered when direct evidence was limited or absent . The initial search of the electronic databases yielded a total of 1353 records , with much duplication , many studies being indexed in several different databases . These search results were assessed by one reviewer and 705 potentially relevant articles were identified . These studies were then independently assessed by two reviewers based on their abstracts . Finally , 300 studies were included , of which 109 were classified as evidence studies , 52 as method studies and 9 as both evidence and methods . The remaining studies were classified as background or other studies . Data extraction and synthesis We planned to apply a checklist of quality assessment critically to appraise studies that provided empirical evidence ( Appendix 2 ) . However , we found it was extremely difficult because of poor reliability of the checklist ; different reviewers often disagreed about the overall quality of studies . The task of quality assessment was made more difficult because the designs and objectives of relevant studies in this review were highly diverse . Considering the very limited time available , we decided not to apply the checklist for quality assessment . However , we did try to identify and summarise the main limitations in studies that provided empirical evidence on publication bias in the review , although this assessment of study validity was not as systematic as specified in the protocol . Initially , data from the included studies were independently extracted by two reviewers using separate data extraction forms for empirical and methodological studies ( Appendix 2 and Appendix 3 ) and any disagreements were resolved by consensus . However , we found that data extracted using Appendix 2 and Appendix 3 were often insufficient , and the extraction of data from studies directly into study tables was more flexible and efficient . To save time , one reviewer extracted data directly into tables , which were checked by a second reviewer . Findings from the newly identified studies and the previously identified studies 2 are summarised to assess each type of publication bias and the impact of these biases on the results of the systematic review and consequently decision - making . Evidence and method studies were narratively synthesised . Where judged appropriate , the results have been quantitatively pooled ( e . g . the odds ratio of full publication of studies according to results ) . Heterogeneity across studies within each subgroup was measured using the I 2 statistic . 16 Meta - analyses were carried out using Review Manager ( RevMan Version 5 . 0 . Copenhagen : The Nordic Cochrane Centre , The Cochrane Collaboration , 2008 ) . Assessment of a sample of published reviews In the previous HTA report , 193 systematic reviews taken from the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness ( DARE ) were used to identify further evidence of dissemination bias and to illustrate the methods used in systematic reviews for dealing with publication bias . However , there were several shortcomings in our previous assessment . Firstly , systematic reviews included in the DARE database might on average have been of better quality than those from the general bibliographic databases ( such as MEDLINE ) so the representativeness of systematic reviews assessed in the previous HTA report was questionable . Secondly , 91 % of systematic reviews evaluated effectiveness of health - care interventions and 9 % evaluated the accuracy of diagnostic technologies , and these were not separately assessed . The problem of dissemination bias might be different between the two types of systematic reviews . Thirdly , neither reviews of epidemiological studies of association between risk factors and health outcomes nor reviews of studies of association between genes and diseases were included in the previous HTA report . To overcome these shortcomings , in the current updated review we have obtained a representative sample of systematic reviews from the general bibliographic database MEDLINE and have separately assessed them as ( 1 ) systematic reviews of studies on effects of health - care interventions or treatment reviews , ( 2 ) systematic reviews of epidemiological studies on association between risk factors and health outcomes or epidemiological reviews , ( 3 ) systematic reviews of genetic studies on association between genes and disease or genetic reviews , and ( 4 ) systematic reviews of studies on accuracy of diagnostic tests or diagnostic reviews . Review objectives and methods 8 We have also assessed a sample of systematic reviews that tested for publication bias . Identifying and sampling of reviews A search of MEDLINE using ‘systematic review’ or ‘meta - analysis’ ( in titles or in abstracts ) identified 3503 English - language references published in 2006 and 2007 . In this updated review , any published literature reviews of primary studies that reported methods for literature search were considered systematic reviews . Editorials , letters and review of reviews were excluded . These references were assessed by one reviewer to identify systematic reviews . Then the identified systematic reviews ( n = 2481 ) were categorised by one reviewer into four categories – treatment effect , diagnostic accuracy , risk factors , and gene - disease association reviews – and checked by another reviewer . The final sample of reviews comprised 1448 treatment reviews , 251 diagnostic reviews , 598 epidemiological reviews and 184 genetic reviews . We then obtained computer - generated random numbers to select a random sample of 100 systematic reviews of treatment effects , 50 reviews of studies of diagnostic accuracy , 100 reviews of epidemiological studies , and 50 reviews of gene - disease associations . For the assessment of reviews that explicitly considered or tested for publication bias , we used a restrictive search strategy limited to systematic reviews or meta - analyses that tested publication bias and were published from 2000 to 2008 in the English language ( Appendix 1 ) . The search was conducted in August 2008 and identified 204 potentially relevant reviews . These were assessed by one reviewer to identify those reviews that tested for publication bias and then computer - generated random numbers were used to select a random sample of 50 such reviews . Data extraction and analysis Using a data extraction form ( Appendix 4 , slightly revised according to types of reviews ) , two reviewers independently extracted data from included systematic reviews . Any disagreements between the two reviewers were resolved by discussion or by scrutiny from a third reviewer . A pre - derived scoring system was tested to assess the reviewers’ judgement on efforts taken to reduce publication bias and risk of publication bias to assess the degree of agreement between the two reviewers . According to measures taken to deal with publication and related biases in a systematic review , efforts to minimise publication bias were judged to be ‘sufficient’ , or ‘partial sufficient’ or ‘insufficient’ . Risk of publication bias was correspondingly considered to be ‘low’ , or ‘moderate’ or ‘high’ ( see Chapter 9 for more details ) . Data were separately extracted from systematic reviews of effects of health - care interventions , systematic reviews of epidemiological studies , systematic reviews of genetic studies and systematic reviews of studies on accuracy of diagnostic tests . Each category of systematic reviews was analysed separately and then compared . Within each category of systematic reviews , methods used for identifying and preventing or reducing publication and related biases were examined and compared . Data from the reviews that tested for publication biases were assessed separately to find the most commonly used method to test publication bias and risk of publication bias in such reviews . The findings are synthesised and discussed in detail in Chapter 8 . Systematic reviews of effects of health - care interventions and systematic reviews of diagnostic accuracy published in the previous HTA report were also compared with the present findings to examine whether the reporting and treatment of dissemination bias have improved over time .

This evidence is indirect because factors other than publication bias may also lead to the observed disparities . The existence of publication bias was first suspected by Sterling in 1959 , after observing that 97 % of studies published in four major psychology journals were statistically significant . 18 In 1995 , the same author concluded that the practices leading to publication bias had not changed over a period of 30 years . 19 Direct evidence includes the admissions of bias on the part of those involved in the publication process ( investigators , referees or editors ) , comparison of the results of published and unpublished studies , and the follow - up of cohorts of registered studies . 2 The 2000 HTA report on publication bias included both direct and indirect evidence . Because of a large amount of new direct evidence , this updated review focuses on direct evidence from empirical studies , but indirect evidence will also be considered when direct evidence is limited . Surveys of authors and investigators that provide evidence on publication bias are included in Chapter 5 ( sources of publication bias ) . This section includes any empirical studies that tracked a cohort of studies before their formal publication and reported the rate of publication by study results . Cohort studies on time to publication and selective outcome reporting will be reviewed later . Included cohort studies of publication bias were classified into four subgroups according to the starting point of follow - up of cohorts : inception cohort studies , regulatory cohort studies , abstract cohort studies and manuscript cohort studies . A study that followed up a cohort of research from their beginning ( even if retrospectively ) was termed an inception cohort study . A regulatory cohort study refers to a study that examined formal publication of research submitted to regulatory authorities . An abstract cohort study refers to a study that investigated the subsequent full publication of abstracts presented at conferences . A manuscript cohort study refers to a study of manuscripts submitted to journals . Primary studies included in cohort studies of publication bias may be clinical trials , observational studies or basic research . Publication of a study was usually defined as the full publication in journals . However , study results may be categorised differently in the included cohort studies . In this review , study results were classified as ‘statistically significant ( p ≤ 0 . 05 ) ’ versus ‘non - significant ( p > 0 . 05 ) ’ or ‘positive’ versus ‘non - positive’ . Positive results included those that were considered being ‘positive’ , ‘favourable’ , ‘significant’ , ‘important’ , ‘striking’ , ‘showed effect’ and ‘confirmatory’ . Non - positive result refers to other results labelled as being ‘negative’ , ‘non - significant’ , ‘less or not important’ , ‘invalidating’ , ‘inconclusive’ , ‘questionable’ , ‘null’ and ‘neutral’ . Inception cohort studies Five cohort studies were included in the 2000 HTA report . 20 – 24 Cohorts of research protocols approved by Research Ethics Committees ( REC ) , Institutional Review Boards ( IRB ) or registered by research sponsors were followed up to investigate factors associated with subsequent publication . The study by Ioannidis included randomised controlled trials ( RCTs ) conducted by two groups of trialists [ sponsored by the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) from 1986 to 1996 ] and was focused mainly on time lag bias . 23 The rate of publication ranged from 60 % to 98 % for studies with statistically significant results and from 20 % to 85 % for studies with statistically non - significant results . Dickersin ( 1997 ) combined the results from four cohort studies 20 – 22 , 24 and found that the pooled adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) for publication bias ( publication of studies with significant or important results versus those with unimportant results ) was 2 . 54 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 44 to 4 . 47 ) . 25 Chapter 3 Evidence from cohort studies of publication bias Evidence from cohort studies of publication bias 10 The updated review included seven additional inception cohorts that provided data on the rate of publication according to study results ( Appendix 5 ) . 26 – 32 Seven other inception cohort studies were excluded because they did not examine the association between publication and study results . 33 – 39 The cohort study by Bardy ( 1998 ) included 188 of the 274 drug trials notified to the Finnish National Agency in 1987 . 26 Study results were classified as being positive if the risk - benefit ratio was in favour of the drug under investigation , or if the objective of the study was supported . Results were considered inconclusive if the risk - benefit assessment was inconclusive or if the study was non - comparative , whereas studies were judged as negative if the benefit - risk ratio was not in favour of the drug or no different from placebo . The rate of publication was 47 % for positive results , 33 % for inconclusive results , and 11 % for negative results . 26 Cronin and Sheldon ( 2004 ) sent a questionnaire to project leaders of 101 projects sponsored by the UK NHS R & D ( research and development ) programme to obtain information on study findings and publication status . 27 The method suggested by Dickersin and Min 40 was used to define study results . Studies were categorised as ‘showed ( an ) effect’ or not , depending on whether results were statistically significant ( p < 0 . 05 ) or considered to be of great importance . The rate of publication of studies with statistically significant or important results was not statistically significantly different from those with non - significant or non - important results ( 76 % versus 64 % ) . 27 Two cohort studies by Decullier and colleagues ( 2005 , 2006 ) followed up biomedical research protocols approved by French RECs in 1994 and 1997 . 28 , 29 In one of the two French studies , results of 501 completed studies were classified by original investigators as being confirmatory , invalidating or inconclusive ( see Appendix 5 for details ) . 28 The rate of publication of studies with confirmatory results was higher than those with inconclusive results ( OR = 4 . 59 ; 95 % CI : 2 . 21 to 9 . 54 ) . 28 In the other French study of 47 completed studies , the importance of results was subjectively rated by investigators from 1 to 10 , and important results were those graded as > 5 . 29 The rate of publication was 70 % for studies with important results and 60 % for those with less important results ( OR = 1 . 58 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 37 to 6 . 71 ) . 29 Misakian and Bero identified a cohort of 61 passive smoking research projects that were sponsored by 76 organisations between 1981 and 1995 . 30 A semi - structured telephone interview of investigators was carried out to verify study results and publication status . Study results were classified as statistically significant or statistically non - significant . The mixed result refers to a situation in which at least one of multiple primary outcomes was statistically significant . The rate of publication was 85 % for statistically significant results , 86 % for non - significant results , and only 14 % for the mixed results . 30 The publication status of 68 RCTs processed through the pharmacy department of an eye hospital since 1963 was examined by Wormald et al . 31 This study was published only as a conference abstract and additional data were provided in Dwan et al . 41 The rate of publication was 93 % for statistically significant results and 71 % for non - significant results . Zimpel and Windeler investigated the subsequent publication of 140 medical theses on complementary medical subjects . 32 Results were classified as positive or non - positive ( this classification is slightly unclear as the article was published in German ) . Publication status was tracked by searching MEDLINE and by personal communication with authors or supervisors . The rate of publication was 40 % for positive results and 28 % for negative results . 32 Regulatory cohort studies No regulatory cohort studies of publication bias were included in the previous HTA report . In this updated review we identified four regulatory cohort studies that examined formal publication of clinical trials submitted to regulatory authorities ( Appendix 6 ) . 42 – 45 Of the four regulatory cohort studies , two did not specify clinical fields 42 , 44 and two focused on antidepressants . 43 , 45 One study was not included because the association of journal publication and study results was not reported . 46 Melander et al . conducted a study of 42 randomised placebo - controlled trials of five antidepressants submitted by industry to the Swedish drug regulatory authority for marketing approval . 43 Studies were classified according to whether they found the test drug was significantly more effective than the placebo with the primary outcome . Publication status ( including stand - alone , pooled or multiple publications ) of the trials was investigated by searching electronic bibliographic DOI : 10 . 3310 / hta14080 Health Technology Assessment 2010 ; Vol . 14 : No . 8 © 2010 Queen’s Printer and Controller of HMSO . All rights reserved . 11 databases and contacting the companies . All 21 studies with significant results were published ( stand - alone or pooled ) while only 81 % of studies with non - significant results were published . 43 Turner et al . examined 74 clinical trials of 12 antidepressant agents submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) between 1987 and 2004 . 45 Trial results were classified as positive , questionable or negative according to the FDA’s regulatory decisions . Publication status of trials was determined by searching literature databases and contacting trial sponsors . The rate of publication was 97 % for studies with positive results , 50 % for studies with questionable results , and 33 % for studies with negative results . 45 In a study by Lee et al . , formal publication of 909 trials supporting 90 new drugs approved by the FDA between 1998 and 2000 was verified by searches of PubMed and other databases . 42 Statistical significance of the primary outcome was defined as being p < 0 . 05 or a CI excluding no difference . For equivalency or non - inferiority trials , the statistically significant result refers to those with ‘ p > 0 . 05 or a CI including no difference or a CI excluding the pre - specified difference described in the trial’ . 42 It was reported that the rate of formal publication was higher for trials with significant results than those with non - significant results ( 66 % versus 36 % ) . Similar to the above study , a more recently published study included all efficacy trials supporting new drug applications approved by the FDA from 2001 to 2002 . 44 Favourable results were those being significantly ( p < 0 . 05 ) in favour of the new drug or those confirming equivalence in non - inferiority trials . Trials with favourable results were more likely to be published compared with trials with not favourable or unknown results ( 82 % versus 64 % ) . 44 Cohorts of meeting abstracts In the 2000 HTA report on publication bias , 2 we identified eight reports that examined the association between study results and the subsequent full publication of research initially presented as abstracts in meetings or journals . 47 – 54 A Cochrane Methodology Review included 79 studies of the subsequent full publication of biomedical research results initially presented as abstracts or in summary form . 55 Sixteen of the 79 studies reported data on the rate of publication by significance or importance of study results . Our updated search identified 22 additional cohort studies of research abstracts that provided data on publication bias ( for details of all these studies , see Appendix 7 ) . 56 – 77 Almost all of the 30 cohort studies of conference abstracts were restricted to a specific clinical field , such as emergency medicine , anaesthesiology , perinatal medicine , cystic fibrosis or oncology . The rate of full publication of meeting abstracts ranged from 37 % to 81 % for statistically significant results , and from 22 % to 70 % for non - significant results . Manuscript cohort studies We identified four studies of cohorts of manuscripts submitted to journals ( Appendix 8 ) . 78 – 81 Two studies examined manuscripts submitted to general medical journals [ Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) , British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) , The Lancet and Annals of Internal Medicine ] 78 , 81 and two used manuscripts submitted to the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery ( American Version ) . 79 , 80 The study results of submitted papers were classified according to the significance of statistical tests ( p < 0 . 05 or not ) in the two studies of manuscripts submitted to general medical journals . 78 , 81 In the studies of manuscripts submitted to the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery , results were classified as being positive or negative or neutral , although the definitions of these outcomes may be different between the two studies ( Appendix 8 ) . 79 , 80 Results from these studies suggested that the acceptance of submitted papers for publication by journals was not significantly associated with the direction or strength of their findings . In the study of Olson et al . , 81 133 accepted manuscripts were further examined and it was found that time to publication was not associated with statistical significance ( median 7 . 8 months for positive and 7 . 6 months for negative results , p = 0 . 44 ) . 82 However , a subgroup analysis of 156 manuscripts with a high level of evidence ( level I or II ) in the study by Okike et al . found that the acceptance rate was significantly higher for studies with positive or neutral results than for studies with negative results ( 37 % , 36 % and 5 % respectively ; p = 0 . 02 ) . 80 These manuscript cohort studies are generally well designed and conducted . Although no conflict of interest was declared in these studies , this kind of study will always need support or collaboration Evidence from cohort studies of publication bias 12 from editors of the journals . In prospective studies , editors’ decisions on the acceptance of manuscripts may be influenced by their awareness of the ongoing study . 81 Pooled analyses of cohort studies Results from different studies of publication bias have been quantitatively combined in previous reviews , 25 , 55 , 83 although it is still controversial because of heterogeneity across individual studies . 41 Pooled estimates may improve statistical power and the generalisability of results . In this review , the association between study results and the possibility of subsequent publication was measured by using odds ratios ( OR ) . Heterogeneity across studies within each subgroup was measured using the I 2 statistic . 16 A random - effects model was used in meta - analyses . The formal publication of statistically significant results ( p < 0 . 05 ) could be compared with that of non - significant results in four inception cohort studies , one regulatory cohort study , 12 abstract cohort studies and two manuscript cohort studies ( Figure 2 ) . The rate of publication of studies in the four inception cohorts ranged from 60 % to 93 % for significant results and from 20 % to 86 % for non - significant results . The rate of full publication of meeting abstracts ranged from 37 % to 81 % for statistically significant results , and from 22 % to 70 % for non - significant results . Heterogeneity across the four cohort studies from the inception subgroup was statistically significant ( I 2 = 61 % , p = 0 . 05 ) . There was no statistically significant heterogeneity across studies within the cohort studies of abstracts and cohort studies of manuscripts . The pooled odds ratio for publication bias by statistical significance of results was 2 . 40 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 18 to 4 . 88 ) for the four inception cohort studies , 1 . 62 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 34 to 1 . 96 ) for the 12 abstract cohort studies , and 1 . 15 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 64 to 2 . 10 ) for the two manuscript cohort studies ( Figure 2 ) . To include data from other cohort studies , a positive result was defined as being important or confirmatory or significant , while a ‘non - positive’ result included negative , non - important , inconclusive or non - significant results . This more inclusive definition of positive results allowed the inclusion of all 12 inception cohort studies , four regulatory cohort studies , 29 abstract cohort studies , and four manuscript cohort studies ( Figure 3 ) . There was statistically significant heterogeneity across cohort studies within the inception ( p = 0 . 06 ) , regulatory ( p = 0 . 04 ) and abstract subgroups ( p < 0 . 001 ) . Pooled estimates of odds ratios consistently indicated that studies with positive results were more likely to be published than studies with non - positive results , but this was not true after the submission to journals ( Figure 3 ) . Types of studies included in the cohort studies varied , and included basic experimental , observational and qualitative research , and clinical trials . When the analyses were restricted to clinical trials , the result was not significantly different from that based on all studies . Although the number of cohort studies that could be included was small , clear evidence of publication bias can still be observed when the analysis was restricted to clinical trials ( Figure 4 and Figure 5 ) . We constructed funnel plots separately for the four subgroups of cohort studies ( Figure 6 ) . The asymmetry of these funnel plots was tested using the method recommended by Peters et al . 9 ( This is a method of linear regression analysis , using log odds ratio as the dependent variable and the inverse of the total sample size as the independent variable . Please see Chapter 8 for more details about this method . ) There was no statistically significant asymmetry for the funnel plots of inception cohort studies ( p = 0 . 178 ) , regulatory cohort studies ( p = 0 . 262 ) , abstract cohort studies ( p = 0 . 233 ) or manuscript cohort studies ( p = 0 . 942 ) . Main results of the above meta - analyses of cohort studies are summarised in Table 1 . Factors associated with publication bias Some cohort studies have examined the impacts of certain factors on the publication of research . The factors investigated included study design , type of study , sample size , funding source and investigators’ characteristics . Easterbrook et al . ( 1991 ) conducted subgroup analyses to examine susceptibility to publication bias among various subgroups of studies . They found that observational , laboratory - based experimental studies and non - randomised trials had greater risk of publication bias than RCTs . Factors associated with less bias included a concurrent comparison group , a high investigator rating of study importance and a sample size above 20 . 22 Dickersin et al . ( 1992 ) investigated the association between the risk of publication bias and type of study ( observational , clinical trial ) , multi - or single DOI : 10 . 3310 / hta14080 Health Technology Assessment 2010 ; Vol . 14 : No . 8 © 2010 Queen’s Printer and Controller of HMSO .

After excluding Misakian and Bero ( 1998 ) 30 from inception cohort studies , pooled OR = 3 . 19 ( 2 . 21 to 4 . 61 ) ; heterogeneity : I 2 = 0 % , p = 0 . 79 . centre , sample size , funding source and principal investigator ( PI ) characteristics ( such as gender , degree and rank ) . They found that none of the factors examined was associated with publication bias . 20 Dickersin and Min ( 1993 ) reported that the OR for publication bias was 0 . 84 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 07 to 9 . 68 ) for multicentre studies compared to 21 . 14 ( 95 % CI : 2 . 60 to 171 . 7 ) for single centre studies . 21 In addition , the risk of publication bias was different between studies with a female PI ( OR = 0 . 47 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 02 to 11 . 61 ) and studies with a male PI ( OR = 20 . 70 ; 95 % CI : 2 . 61 to 164 . 2 ) . One interesting explanation for the difference in study publication between female and male PIs posted by Dickersin and Min was that ‘women have fewer studies to manage’ , related to their relatively lower rank ( 35 % of women PIs were professors compared to 65 % of male PIs ) , and are thus less selective in study publication . They did not find an association between publication bias and other study features Evidence from cohort studies of publication bias 14

After excluding Misakian and Bero ( 1998 ) 30 from inception cohort studies , pooled OR = 2 . 93 ( 2 . 31 to 3 . 71 ) ; heterogeneity : I 2 = 17 % , p = 0 . 27 . such as the use of randomisation or blinding , having a comparison group or a large sample size . 21 Stern and Simes ( 1997 ) found that the risk of publication bias tended to be greater for clinical trials ( OR = 3 . 13 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 76 to 5 . 58 ) than other studies ( for all quantitative studies OR = 2 . 3 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 47 to 3 . 66 ) . When analysis was restricted to studies with a sample size ≥ 100 , publication bias was still evident ( HR = 2 . 00 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 09 to 3 . 66 ) . 24 Discussions of findings from cohort studies The updated review identified limited new evidence on publication bias based on a follow - up of research protocols , and a large number of new studies on subsequent publication of meeting abstracts . Updated analyses yielded results similar to those from the 2000 HTA report and other existing reviews : studies with statistically significant or positive results are more likely to be formally published than those with non - significant or non - positive results . 2 , 25 , 41 , 55 , 83 Dickersin in 1997 combined the results from four inception cohort studies 20 – 22 , 24 and found that the pooled adjusted odds ratio for publication bias ( publication of studies with significant or important results versus those with unimportant results ) was 2 . 54 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 44 to 4 . 47 ) . 25 A recent systematic review of inception cohort studies of clinical trials found the existence of publication bias and outcome reporting bias , although pooled meta - analysis was not conducted due to perceived differences between studies . 41 A Cochrane methodology review of publication bias by Hopewell et al . 83 included five inception cohort studies of trials registered before the main results were known , 20 , 21 , 23 , 24 , 26 in which the pooled odds ratio for publication bias was 3 . 90 ( 95 % CI : 2 . 68 to 5 . 68 ) .

(cid:19)(cid:17)(cid:24) (cid:20) (cid:21) (cid:24) (cid:20)(cid:19) was examined in 16 of 79 abstract cohort studies . 55 According to these 16 abstract cohort studies , the subsequent full publication of conference abstracts was statistically significantly associated with positive study results ( pooled OR = 1 . 28 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 15 to 1 . 42 ) . Compared with the previous reviews on cohort studies of publication bias , our review is more inclusive in terms of types of studies and is the first to enable an explicit comparison of results from cohort studies of publication bias with fundamentally different sampling frames . Biased selection for publication may affect research dissemination over the whole process from before study completion , to presentation of findings at conferences , manuscript submission to journals , and formal publication in journals . It seems that publication bias occurs mainly before the presentation of findings at conferences and before the submission of manuscript to journals ( see Figure 2 and Figure 3 ) . The subsequent publication of conference abstracts was still biased but the extent of publication bias tended to be smaller compared with all studies conducted . After submission of FiGure 3 Rate of publication of positive versus non - positive results : all studies . After excluding Misakian and Bero ( 1998 ) 30 from inception cohort studies , pooled OR = 2 . 93 ( 2 . 31 to 3 . 71 ) ; heterogeneity : I 2 = 17 % , p = 0 . 27 ( continued ) .

significant versus non - significant results : clinical trials only . manuscript to journals , editorial decisions were not clearly associated with study results . Limitations of the available evidence on publication bias There are some caveats to the available evidence on publication bias . Study findings have been defined differently among the empirical studies assessing publication bias . The most objective method would be to classify quantitative results as statistically significant ( p < 0 . 05 ) or not . However , this was not always possible or appropriate . When other methods were used to classify study results as important or not , bias may be introduced due to inevitable subjectivity . The funnel plot asymmetry is not statistically significant for inception , regulatory , abstract cohort studies and manuscript cohort studies ( see Figure 6 ) . However , there are reasons to suspect the existence of publication and reporting bias in studies of meeting abstracts . A large number of reports of full publication of research abstracts were assessed for inclusion into this review but did not mention the association between publication and study results and so were excluded . This association might not have been examined ; or not reported when the association was not significant . As an example , Zaretsky and Imrie ( 2002 ) 77 reported no significant difference ( p = 0 . 53 ) in the rate of subsequent publication of 57 meeting abstracts between statistically significant and non - significant results ; but this study was not included in the analysis as insufficient data were provided . Large cohort studies on publication bias usually included cases that were highly diverse in terms of research questions , designs and other study characteristics .

Adjusted analyses by some factors may be conducted but it was generally impossible to exclude the impact of confounding factors on the observed association between study results and formal publication . There is very limited and conflicting evidence on factors ( such as study design , sample size , etc . ) that may be associated with publication bias . To improve the understanding of factors associated with publication bias , findings from qualitative research on the process of research dissemination may be helpful . 84 , 85 Evidence from cohort studies of publication bias 18 Cactus Design and Illustration Ltd Figure Number : 00 . 06 . ai Title : 06 - 92 - 02 Proof Stage : 2 Inception cohorts Abstract cohorts In OR 10 8 6 4 2 0 – 5 – 4 – 3 – 2 – 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 10 8 6 4 2 0 – 5 – 4 – 3 – 2 – 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 10 8 6 4 2 0 – 5 – 4 – 3 – 2 – 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 10 8 6 4 2 0 – 5 – 4 – 3 – 2 – 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 1 / S E 1 / S E 1 / S E 1 / S E In OR In OR In OR Manuscript cohorts Regulatory cohorts FiGure 6 Funnel plots – publication of positive and non - positive results .

The observed heterogeneity may be a result of differences in study designs , research questions , how the cohorts were assembled , definitions of study results , and so on . For example , the statistically significant heterogeneity across inception cohort studies was due to one study by Misakian and Bero ( see Figure 2 and Figure 3 ) . 30 After excluding this cohort study , there was no longer significant heterogeneity across inception cohort studies . The cohort study by Misakian and Bero included research on health effects of passive smoking , and the impact of statistical significance of results on publication may be different from studies of other research topics . 30 The four cohorts of trials submitted to regulatory authorities showed greater extent of publication bias than other subgroups of cohort studies ( see Figure 3 ) . 42 – 45 Only 855 primary studies were included in the regulatory cohort studies , and two of the four regulatory cohort studies focused on trials of antidepressants . 43 , 45 Therefore , the four regulatory cohort studies may be a biased selection of all possible cases . Conclusions Despite many caveats about the available empirical evidence on publication bias , there is little doubt that dissemination of research findings is likely to be a biased process . There is consistent empirical evidence that the publication of a study that exhibits statistically significant or ‘important’ results is more likely to occur than the publication of a study that does not show such results . Indirect evidence indicates that publication bias occurs mainly before the presentation of findings at conferences and the submission of manuscripts to journals .

Outcome reporting bias Outcome reporting bias occurs when studies with multiple outcomes report only some of the outcomes measured and the selection of an outcome for reporting is associated with the statistical significance or importance of the result . This bias is due to the incomplete reporting within published studies , and is also called ‘within - study reporting bias’ in order to distinguish it from selective non - reporting of a whole study , 86 or publication bias ‘in situ’ . 87 Number of outcomes measured within trials The existence of a large number of measured or calculated outcomes within a study is the prerequisite of selective reporting bias , which is present in almost all research studies . The selection of outcomes to report can be further classified into three categories : 87 ( 1 ) the selection of outcomes investigated , ( 2 ) the selection of methods to measure the selected outcome , and ( 3 ) the selection of results of multiple subgroup analyses . A large number of results can be generated by the combination of all possible choices . Pocock et al . ( 1987 ) found that the median number of reported end points was six per trial . 88 They also discussed selective reporting of results and related issues of subgroup analyses , repeated measurements over time , multiple treatment groups , and multiple tests of significance . 88 Tannock ( 1996 ) examined 32 RCTs published in 1992 and found that the median number of therapeutic end points per trial was five ( range 2 – 19 ) and 13 trials did not define their primary end point . 89 Each of the 32 trials , on average , reported six ( range 1 – 31 ) statistical comparisons of major outcome parameters ; and more than half of the implied statistical comparisons had not been reported . 89 The number of outcomes estimated from published articles may underestimate the actual number of outcomes measured in trial studies . Based on information from trial protocols , Chan et al . 6 , 7 found that the median number of efficacy outcomes was 20 per trial and the median number of harm outcomes was six or five per trial . Although outcome reporting bias was highly suspected , there was very limited empirical research included in the 2000 HTA report . 90 The updated review has identified many recently published empirical studies that provided direct evidence with which to assess the existence and extent of outcome reporting bias ( see Appendix 9 for details of the included studies ) . Direct evidence on outcome reporting bias The most direct evidence on the existence and extent of outcome reporting bias is from studies that compared outcomes specified in research protocols and those reported in subsequent articles . A pilot study by Hahn et al . ( 2002 ) 36 was the first attempt to compare outcomes specified in trial protocols approved by a local REC and results reported in subsequent publications . They compared outcomes in 15 pairs of protocols and journal articles . Six of the 15 studies stated primary outcome variables in their protocols and four used the same outcomes as primary outcomes in the reports . An analysis plan was mentioned in eight studies , but the plan was followed in only one published report . Chan and colleagues provided the most direct evidence on outcome reporting bias by investigating a cohort of 102 RCT protocols approved by the Danish REC from 1994 to 1995 , 6 and another cohort of 48 RCT protocols approved by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research from 1990 to 1998 . 7 Data on unreported and reported Chapter 4 Evidence of different types of dissemination bias Evidence of different types of dissemination bias 22 outcomes were collated based on trial protocols , subsequently published journal articles , and a survey of trialists . If a published article provided insufficient data for meta - analysis , the outcome was defined as being incompletely reported . They found that 50 % of efficacy outcomes and 65 % of harm outcomes were incompletely reported in the Danish cohort ; and 31 % and 59 % respectively in the Canadian cohort . Primary outcomes specified in protocols were different from primary outcomes stated in the corresponding journal articles in 62 % ( Danish cohort ) and 40 % ( Canadian cohort ) of cases . Statistically significant outcomes were more likely to be fully reported than non - significant outcomes . The odds ratio of an efficacy outcome being fully reported if it were statistically significant versus non - significant was 2 . 4 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 4 to 4 . 0 ) in the Danish cohort and 2 . 7 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 5 to 5 . 0 ) in the Canadian cohort . The biased reporting of significant outcomes appears more severe for harm data , the odds ratios were 4 . 7 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 8 to 12 . 0 ) and 7 . 7 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 5 to 111 ) respectively . 6 , 7 Further work by Chan and Altman ( 2005 ) identified 519 RCTs indexed in PubMed in December 2000 , and they conducted a survey of trialists to obtain information on unreported outcomes . 5 The median proportion of incompletely reported outcomes per trial was 42 % for efficacy outcomes and 50 % for harm outcomes . The pooled odds ratio for outcome reporting bias was 2 . 0 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 6 to 2 . 7 ) for efficacy outcomes and 1 . 9 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 1 to 3 . 5 ) for harm outcomes . Reasons given by authors for not reporting efficacy and harm outcomes included space constraints ( 47 % and 25 % ) , lack of clinical importance ( 37 % and 75 % ) , and being statistically non - significant ( 24 % and 50 % ) . 5 Ghersi et al . ( 2006 ) compared 103 published RCTs and their protocols approved by Central Sydney Area Health Service REC from 1992 to 1996 . 91 They found that 17 % of primary outcomes specified in the protocols and 15 % reported in articles differed between the protocols and publications . Trials for which all comparisons were statistically significant were more likely to report all outcomes fully ( p = 0 . 06 ) . As the study by Ghersi et al . was presented only as an abstract there was a lack of information on its study design and other results . 91 Other evidence One consequence of outcome reporting bias is that many trials cannot be included in meta - analyses because of incompletely reported outcomes in published papers . Although unreported data may be available from trialists , such communication can be time consuming and often does not result in additional data becoming available . McCormack et al . 92 compared the results of a meta - analysis based on published data with an updated IPD ( individual patient data , where the complete original datasets of the included studies are used to pool study data , rather than simply using summary measures from published reports ) meta - analysis of trials of hernia surgery . For the outcome of hernia recurrence , the number of contributing RCTs was similar and the results were not significantly different between the two analyses . For the outcome of persisting pain , IPD meta - analysis included many more RCTs ( 3 versus 20 ) and provided qualitatively divergent results , as compared with the meta - analysis of published data . This case study indicates that some outcomes ( e . g . persisting pain ) may be more vulnerable to selective reporting than other outcomes ( e . g . hernia recurrence ) . 92 In a recent study , Bekkering et al . examined 767 observational studies ( with 3284 results ) and found that only 61 % of the reported results could be used in meta - analyses investigating dose – response associations between diet and prostate or bladder cancer . 93 Usable results were more likely to indicate the existence of the association than those that were not usable . 93 Furukawa et al . 94 investigated the association between the proportion of contributing RCTs and the pooled estimates of 156 Cochrane systematic reviews . A median of 46 % [ interquartile range ( IQR ) 20 % to 75 % ] of identified RCTs in each meta - analysis contributed to the pooled estimates . The results of regression analysis revealed a general trend that the greater the proportion of contributing RCTs the smaller the treatment effect . It was concluded that outcome reporting may be biased . 94 A methodological study by Williamson and Gamble 95 provided a motivating example and four cases in which results of Cochrane reviews were compared with results of sensitivity analysis ( by imputation ) when within - study outcome reporting bias was suspected . The example was a meta - analysis of beta - lactam versus a combination of beta - lactam and aminoglycoside in the treatment of cancer patients with neutropenia , in which only five of the nine eligible RCTs could be included . They found that the pooled treatment effect was considerably decreased in sensitivity analysis where DOI : 10 . 3310 / hta14080 Health Technology Assessment 2010 ; Vol . 14 : No . 8 © 2010 Queen’s Printer and Controller of HMSO . All rights reserved . 23 the missing results were imputed . For the other four selected cases , within - study selection was suspected in several trials but the impact on the conclusions of the meta - analyses was minimal . 95 Scharf and Colevas compared adverse events reported in 22 published articles and corresponding protocols or data from Clinical Data Update System ( CDUS , the National Cancer Institute’s electronic database of clinical trial information ) . 96 The study found considerable mismatch in high - grade adverse events between the articles and the CDUS data , but it was not clear whether the mismatch was due to bias . It is important to note that published articles under - reported low - grade adverse effects : only 58 % of low - grade adverse effects recorded in the CDUS database were reported in articles . 96 Selective reporting of multiple alternative analyses Bias may be introduced by selective reporting of multiple results generated by different analyses for a given outcome . Melander et al . 43 compared 42 trials of five selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) antidepressants submitted to the Swedish Drug Regulatory Authority for marketing approval and published articles . The study considered only one outcome , response rate . Both intention - to - treat ( ITT ) analysis and per protocol analysis were presented in 41 of the 42 submitted reports , but in only two stand - alone publications . The stand - alone publications tended to report the more favourable result by per protocol analysis . 43 Compared with clinical trials , epidemiological studies may be more susceptible to selective reporting of results because of their exploratory nature . Kyzas et al . ( 2005 ) 97 conducted a meta - analysis to assess the association between a prognostic factor , the tumour suppressor protein 53 ( TP53 ) , and mortality outcome of patients with head and neck squamous cell cancer . They compared the results using ( 1 ) data from 18 studies that were indexed with ‘survival’ or ‘mortality’ in MEDLINE or EMBASE , ( 2 ) data from 13 published studies that were not indexed with ‘survival’ or ‘mortality’ in MEDLINE or EMBASE , and ( 3 ) data retrieved from authors for 11 studies in which data on mortality were collected but no usable data were reported . The pooled relative risk for mortality was 1 . 27 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 06 to 1 . 53 ) using 18 published and indexed studies , 1 . 13 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 81 to 1 . 59 ) using 13 published but not indexed studies , and 0 . 97 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 72 to 1 . 29 ) using retrieved data . According to the study by Kyzas et al . , 97 TP53 status can be measured by different methods . When available , Kyzas et al . used immunohistochemistry data , and a TP53 - positive status was defined as nuclear staining in at least 10 % of tumour cells or at least moderate staining in qualitative scales . They also standardised all - cause mortality to 24 months of follow - up . It was found that the association was stronger by using the definitions preferred by each publication ( RR 1 . 38 ; 1 . 13 – 1 . 67 ) than when definitions were standardised ( RR 1 . 27 ; 1 . 06 – 1 . 53 ) . Kavvoura et al . investigated the discrepancy between abstracts and full papers of epidemiological studies using 389 abstracts and 50 randomly selected full papers . 98 In the abstracts , 88 % reported one or more statistically significant relative risks and only 43 % reported one or more non - significant relative risks . The prevalence of significant results was less prominent in full texts of the articles . A median of nine ( IQR 5 – 16 ) significant and six ( IQR 3 – 16 ) non - significant relative risks were presented in the full text of the 50 articles . They also found that ‘investigators selectively present contrasts between more extreme groups when relative risks are inherently lower’ . 98 Summary of evidence on outcome reporting bias The most direct evidence is from the two studies that compared outcomes specified in trial protocols and outcomes reported in subsequent publications . 6 , 7 The results of unreported outcomes were obtained by a survey of original investigators . Due to low response rates and insufficient data for 2 × 2 tables , many included cases were excluded from the calculation of odds ratios . In the Danish cohort of 102 trials , 6 the odds ratio for reporting bias was based on 50 trials for efficacy outcomes and 18 trials for harm outcomes . Thirty trials for efficacy and only four trials for harm outcomes were used in the Canadian cohort of 48 trials . 7 This low response rate is likely to lead to an underestimation of outcome reporting bias . Trials included in these two studies were mostly published before the CONSORT statement appeared in 2001 , so it would be interesting to investigate whether outcome reporting bias has been reduced in trials published since 2001 . Findings from ongoing studies may provide further empirical evidence . For example , one study by Ghersi et al . compared 103 published RCTs and Evidence of different types of dissemination bias 24 their protocols , and was presented in 2006 as a conference abstract . It is now available only in abstract form with insufficient study detail . 91 We also identified an ongoing MRC - funded study 99 that aims to investigate the proportion and impact of within - study outcome reporting in an unselected cohort of 300 Cochrane systematic reviews . Although case studies often yield evidence of limited usefulness , they may provide evidence indicating what further research is required . For example , the study by McCormack et al . of IPD meta - analysis indicated that some subjectively assessed outcomes may be more vulnerable to reporting bias than objectively assessed outcomes . 92 Time lag bias When the speed of publication depends on the direction and strength of the study results , this is referred to as time lag bias . 100 Empirical evidence on time lag bias could be separated into two categories : ( 1 ) the relationship between the study results and time to publication , and ( 2 ) changes in reported effect size over time . Time to publication The process of research is usually complex and involves several important milestones . These include development of the research proposal , approval by a research ethics committee , obtaining research funding , recruitment of participants , completion of follow - up , submission of manuscripts to a journal , and final publication in peer - reviewed journals . Measurement of elapsed ‘time to publication’ could be considered to start from any of these milestones , for example , from the date of REC approval , funding received , initiation or completion of enrolment , completion of follow - up , or manuscript submission . Four cohort studies were analysed in the 2000 HTA report ( see Appendix 10 ) . Simes ( 1987 ) examined the time from trial closure to publication , using 38 published or unpublished trials on advanced ovarian cancer or multiple myeloma . 101 All six trials that showed a statistically significant survival difference were published within 5 years of study closure , while 5 of the 32 trials that showed no significant difference were published more than 5 years after study closure , and 7 of the 32 trials with non - significant results were not yet published . 101 In a survey of 218 quantitative studies approved by a hospital Ethics Committee in Australia , Stern and Simes observed that the median time from granting of ethical approval to the first publication in a peer - reviewed journal was 4 . 8 years for studies with significant results as compared with 8 . 0 years for studies with null results ( HR 2 . 32 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 47 to 3 . 66 ) . 24 Adjustment for other factors that affect publication ( e . g . research design and funding source ) did not change this result materially . When only the large quantitative studies ( sample size > 100 ) were analysed , the time lag bias remained evident ( HR 2 . 00 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 09 to 3 . 66 ) . 24 Studies with non - significant trend ( 0 . 05 < p < 0 . 10 ) were published later compared with studies with null results ( p > 0 . 10 ) ( HR 0 . 43 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 15 to 1 . 24 ) . For qualitative studies ( n = 103 ) , there was no clear evidence of time lag bias involving studies with unimportant or negative results . 24 Further empirical evidence on time lag bias came from a cohort of 66 completed phase 2 or phase 3 trials , conducted between 1986 and 1996 by a clinical trials group on AIDS . 23 The results were classified as ‘positive’ if an experimental therapy for AIDS was significantly ( p < 0 . 05 ) better than the control therapy . ‘Negative results’ included those with no statistically significant difference and those in favour of the control therapy . Definition of publication was that the trial findings had to be published in a peer - reviewed journal . The median time from start of enrolment to publication was 4 . 3 years for positive trials as compared to 6 . 4 years for negative trials ( p < 0 . 001 ) . Positive trials were submitted for publication more rapidly after completion ( median 1 . 0 year versus 1 . 6 years ; p = 0 . 001 ) and were published more rapidly after submission ( median 0 . 8 years versus 1 . 1 years ; p = 0 . 04 ) , compared with negative trials . 23 Misakian and Bero identified 61 completed studies through a survey of 89 organisations that supported research on the health impact of passive smoking . 30 Time to publication was assessed from the start date of funding because it was difficult to decide the time of study completion . ‘Published studies’ were those that appeared in a peer - reviewed , non - peer - reviewed , or in - press publication , but not if published only as abstracts . The median time from funding start to publication was 5 years ( 95 % CI : 4 to 7 ) for statistically non - significant studies , and 3 years ( 95 % CI : 3 to 5 ) for statistically significant studies ( p = 0 . 004 ) . Multivariate analysis revealed that time to publication was associated with the statistical significance of the results ( p = 0 . 004 ) , experimental study design ( p = 0 . 01 ) , study size ( p = 0 . 01 ) and animals as subjects ( p = 0 . 03 ) . 30 DOI : 10 . 3310 / hta14080 Health Technology Assessment 2010 ; Vol . 14 : No . 8 © 2010 Queen’s Printer and Controller of HMSO . All rights reserved . 25 The updated review identified five new empirical studies of the interval before manuscript submission to publication ( Appendix 10 ) , 27 , 37 , 102 – 104 and one study of time from manuscript submission to publication . 81 Min and Dickersin found that statistically significant or important results were associated with time from completion of enrolment to full publication ( HR = 1 . 75 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 14 to 2 . 93 ) , according to a study of 242 observational studies initiated at Johns Hopkins University . 104 However , Cronin and Sheldon examined a cohort of 70 studies sponsored by the UK NHS R & D programme and did not observe a significant difference in time from study completion to publication by whether a study result was significant ( p < 0 . 05 or important ) or not ( HR = 0 . 53 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 25 to 1 . 1 ) . 27 Similarly , study results were not found to be significantly associated with time to publication , according to findings from the remaining three empirical studies ( Appendix 10 ) ; however , in all of the studies where data were provided the trend suggested a shorter time for statistically significant or ‘positive’ studies than for non - significant or negative ones , and the cohorts of studies were often small . 37 , 102 , 103 Dickersin et al . tracked 133 manuscripts of comparative studies accepted for publication by the Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) and investigated time from manuscript submission to publication . 82 Results were classified as positive if a statistically significant ( p < 0 . 05 ) difference was reported for the primary outcomes . Seventy - eight ( 59 % ) manuscripts reported positive results , 51 ( 38 % ) reported negative results and the results of four ( 3 % ) articles were unclear . The median time interval between submission and publication was 7 . 8 months for positive studies versus 7 . 6 months for negative studies ( p = 0 . 44 ) . 82 Findings of this study indicated that time lag bias ( if any ) may likely occur before , not after , the manuscript submission to journals . We also identified six studies that investigated the time from abstract presentation at meetings to subsequent full publication ( Appendix 10 ) . 49 , 60 , 61 , 69 , 70 , 105 The study by Krzyzanowska et al . 70 included 510 abstracts of large ( n > 200 ) phase 3 trials presented at an oncology meeting between 1989 and 1998 . They found that trials with statistically significant results were published earlier than those with non - significant results ( median time to publication 2 . 2 versus 3 . 0 years ; HR = 1 . 4 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 1 to 1 . 7 ) . 70 Findings from two other studies 60 , 69 also suggested that time from abstract presentation to full publication was associated with significant results . However , the observed association between study results and time from abstract presentation to publication was not statistically significant in the remaining three studies ( two of which were small in terms of the number of abstracts assessed ) . 49 , 61 , 105 Change in reported effect size over time The 2000 HTA report on publication bias 2 discussed only two brief reports on the temporal trend of reported effect size . 106 , 107 Rothwell and Robertson found that the treatment effect was overestimated by early trials as compared with subsequent trials in 20 of the 26 meta - analyses of clinical trials . 106 In another report , a significant correlation ( p < 0 . 10 ) between the year of publication and the treatment effect was observed in 4 of the 30 meta - analyses published in BMJ or JAMA during 1992 – 6 . 107 The updated review included two new case studies of pharmaceutical interventions 108 , 109 and two studies in research on ecology or evolution 110 , 111 ( Appendix 10 ) . Gehr et al . found that reported effect size significantly decreased over time in three of the four meta - analyses of studies on pharmaceutical interventions . 108 In a case study of N - acetylcysteine in the prevention of contrast - induced nephropathy , Vaitkus and Brar found that trials published earlier reported more favourable results than trials published later . 109 In a study of 44 meta - analyses in ecology , Jennions and Moller found a significant relationship between year of publication and estimated effect size , and the association remained significant even after controlling for sample size ( p < 0 . 01 ) . 110 However , in another case study in the area of ecology , Leimu and Koricheva did not find a significant association between the effect size and year of publication in two meta - analyses of studies testing plant defence theories . 111 Ioannidis and Trikalinos hypothesised that highly contradictory results are more likely to be rapidly published than other results . 112 They investigated changes in between - study variance over time in 44 meta - analyses of epidemiological studies on genetic associations and in 37 meta - analyses of clinical trials of health - care interventions . It was found that early published studies tended to be more heterogeneous than later published studies Evidence of different types of dissemination bias 26 in meta - analyses of genetic associations . There was no significant change in the between - study variance over time in meta - analyses of clinical trials . 112 Summary of evidence on time lag bias Empirical evidence on time lag bias came mainly from studies that investigated time to publication using cohorts of studies . Because of the strict inclusion criteria , the Cochrane Methodology Review on time lag bias 113 included only two cohort studies . 23 , 24 We have adopted a more comprehensive approach and included more relevant studies ( Appendix 10 ) . Four of the five newly identified cohort studies on time lag bias ( before submission ) did not find a significant association between time to publication and study results . 27 , 37 , 101 , 103 These four studies were relatively small , and the sources of the sample were diverse . It is unclear whether poor quality studies may tend to overestimate or underestimate the association between study results and time to publication . Of the six newly included studies of time from abstract presentation at meetings to full publication , three large studies reported significant time lag bias 60 , 69 , 70 while the other three studies ( one large , two small ) did not . 49 , 61 , 105 Considering all the available evidence from cohort studies on time to publication , we conclude that on average studies with significant or important results still tend to be published earlier than studies with non - significant results . However , this conclusion may not be generalisable to many individual cases . Studies included in the identified cohort studies were usually divergent in terms of research questions and design , so that the observed association between study results and time to publication may be influenced by other confounding factors . 109 Limited evidence suggests that study findings that were difficult to interpret , for example , when the p value was greater than 0 . 05 but smaller than 0 . 10 or when results were mixed negative or positive , may take even longer to be published than studies that had clear negative results . If it does exist , time lag bias is likely to occur before manuscript submission for journal publication . 81 One consequence of time lag bias ( earlier publication of significant results ) may be a diminishing effect size reported by studies over time . Therefore , temporal trends of reported effect size in meta - analysis may indicate the existence of time lag bias ( the ‘fading of reported effectiveness’ coined by Gehr et al . ) . 108 Compared with studies included in cohort studies of time to publication , studies in meta - analyses for the investigation of temporal trends of reported effect size were much more similar in term of participants , interventions and outcomes . However , time lag bias is only one of several possible explanations for changes in reported treatment effect over time . 108 It is surprising that only very limited research has been conducted to investigate temporal trends of reported effect size in meta - analysis . Grey literature bias The distinction between grey literature and unpublished or published studies may sometimes be ambiguous . Studies presented in the form of grey literature may be considered as published or as unpublished , according to different definitions . 2 The Third International Conference on Grey Literature defined grey literature as ‘that which is produced on all levels of governmental , academic , business and industry in print and electronic formats , but which is not controlled by commercial publishers’ . 114 Grey literature consists of an immense range , which includes brochures , pamphlets , internal reports , memoranda , databases on ongoing research , newsletters , conference proceedings and abstracts , technical reports , assignments and dissertations 115 as well as personal correspondence , web pages , data archives , policy documents and book chapters . A survey published in 1993 found that 31 % of published meta - analyses included unpublished data . 116 The proportion of people who supported the inclusion of unpublished data in meta - analysis at that time was 78 % for meta - analysts or methodologists , while it was only 47 % for journal editors . 116 Taus et al . reported in 1999 that 11 % of the 814 references of included studies in 75 neurological reviews from the Cochrane Library were from books , theses or other unpublished sources . 117 Tetzlaff et al . presented a survey in 2006 that found that while both editors and review methodologists had become more in favour of including grey literature , editors were still less inclined towards the inclusion of grey literature ( 69 % ) than systematic reviewers or methodologists ( 85 % ) . 118 Empirical evidence on grey literature bias may be separated into two categories : ( 1 ) the subsequent DOI : 10 . 3310 / hta14080 Health Technology Assessment 2010 ; Vol . 14 : No . 8 © 2010 Queen’s Printer and Controller of HMSO . All rights reserved . 27 full publication of a cohort of grey literature ( such as meeting abstracts ) according to study results , and ( 2 ) a comparison of results of fully published studies and grey literature studies that aimed to answer the same research question . Evidence from the first category has been summarised in the cohort studies section . This section focuses on empirical studies that compared results from published and corresponding grey literature . Unpublished and grey literature studies were not separately considered , since it is usually impossible to distinguish the two . Studies of multiple meta - analyses The previous HTA report 2 included one study using multiple meta - analyses . 119 The updated review identified five new studies of multiple meta - analyses in which the results of published studies were compared with those estimated by using grey literature ( see Appendix 11 for six included studies of at least 10 meta - analyses , and 16 individual case studies ) . 3 , 45 , 120 – 122 McAuley et al . ( 2000 ) 119 investigated the impact of exclusion of grey literature from meta - analyses on the estimate of intervention effectiveness . In a sample of 135 meta - analyses , of which 41 meta - analyses ( 30 % ) included some form of grey literature ( between 4 . 5 % and 75 % of included studies ) the removal of grey literature resulted in an increase in the estimate of treatment effect of at least 10 % in nine meta - analyses and a reduction of treatment effect of at least 10 % in five . On average , published literature yielded significantly larger estimates of treatment effect , by 15 % compared with grey literature [ ratio of odds ratio ( ROR ) = 1 . 15 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 04 to 1 . 28 ] . This study concluded that the exclusion of grey literature can lead to overestimation of treatment effects . 119 The empirical study by Egger et al . ( 2003 ) included 60 meta - analyses in which results of published studies ( n = 630 ) could be compared with those of grey literature trials ( n = 153 ) . 3 Estimated treatment effect based on grey literature ranged from 97 % more to 209 % less beneficial than those based on corresponding published trials . Pooled effect estimates from the grey literature were on average 7 % greater than those from published trials ( ROR 1 . 07 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 98 to 1 . 15 ) . 3 However , published trials tended to have a larger sample size and be of better quality than unpublished trials . Therefore , there is a possibility that bias could be introduced by including poor quality grey literature . 3 A recent study by Turner et al . ( 2008 ) compared published and unpublished clinical trials of 12 antidepressant agents . 45 From the FDA database they identified 74 clinical trials of 12 antidepressants approved by the FDA between 1987 and 2004 . Of the 74 trials , 23 were unpublished . It was found that the standardised effect size ( Hedges’ g ) using data from the journal articles ( 0 . 41 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 36 to 0 . 45 ) was on average 32 % ( ranged from 11 % to 69 % ) greater than the effect size using data from the FDA reviews ( 0 . 31 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 27 to 0 . 35 ) ( sign test p < 0 . 001 ) . In addition , negative or questionable findings ( according to the FDA’s decision ) were less likely to be published , and if published , the result was often conveyed as a positive outcome . 45 The remaining three studies of multiple meta - analyses in which the impact of inclusion of grey literature could be investigated 120 – 122 consistently found that published studies on average yielded a greater estimate of treatment effect compared with grey literature studies , although the difference was not statistically significant individually and the direction of bias was unpredictable for individual reviews . Five of the six studies of multiple meta - analyses were included in the Cochrane methodology review on grey literature bias . 123 Using data from three studies 3 , 119 , 122 suitable for combining in meta - analysis , Hopewell et al . estimated that published trials on average suggested a 9 % greater treatment effect than grey literature trials ( pooled ROR for grey literature versus published trials = 1 . 09 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 03 to 1 . 16 ) . 123 Case studies of grey literature bias The previous HTA report 2 reviewed several case studies that investigated the impact of inclusion of grey literature . In the field of psychological and educational research , several case studies reported a tendency for the average effects reported in journal articles to be greater than the effects reported in the corresponding dissertations . 124 – 126 In the medical and health field , the previous HTA report included four case studies . 127 – 130 However , the validity of empirical evidence from case studies may be questionable because of selective reporting . 123 According to findings from the 16 case studies included in this review ( see Appendix 11 for details of the individual studies ) , published studies Evidence of different types of dissemination bias 28 tended to report a greater estimate of effect sizes than grey literature , although the difference was statistically significant in only some studies . 109 , 131 – 134 For example , in an IPD meta - analysis of paternal cell immunisation for recurrent miscarriage , Jeng et al . ( 1995 ) found that the estimated relative risk was 1 . 29 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 03 to 1 . 60 ) using data from four published trials , and it was 1 . 01 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 74 to 1 . 28 ) by using data from four unpublished studies . 131 A meta - analysis of animal experimental studies of nicotinamide for stroke found that abstracts reported a statistically significantly lower estimate of effect size than fully published studies ( p < 0 . 001 ) . 132 One case study by MacLean et al . was at first ( in 1999 ) presented as a meeting abstract 130 and then fully published in 2003 . 135 The study compared data from published studies with data from FDA New Drug Application Reviews for assessing non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) - associated dyspepsia . The quality of unpublished data from FDA reviews was comparable with that of published data . The pooled relative risk for NSAID - induced dyspepsia was 1 . 07 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 70 to 1 . 63 ) using the FDA data , and 1 . 21 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 81 to 1 . 81 ) using data from published trials . Meta - regression analyses found that estimates varied significantly by NSAID dose ( p = 0 . 037 ) but were not related to whether the study was published or not ( p = 0 . 73 ) . 135 The reported difference between the published and grey literature appeared greater in the abstract 130 than that in the full publication . 135 It is interesting to compare two case studies on the same topic . 136 , 137 Whittington et al . ( 2004 ) compared the results of published and unpublished data from clinical trials of SSRIs in childhood depression . 136 They found that the results of published trials indicated a favourable risk - benefit profile for some SSRIs , while unpublished data tended to be unfavourable . They concluded that ‘non - publication of trials , for whatever reason , or the omission of important data from published trials , can lead to erroneous recommendations for treatment’ . 136 In another case study by Wallace et al . ( 2006 ) , a cumulative meta - analytic approach was used to synthesise evidence from trials of SSRIs in paediatric depression . 137 Although the unpublished data tended to suggest that the SSRIs were less efficacious and more harmful , the overall interpretation of evidence on efficacy and safety would not change on inclusion of unpublished trials . 137 Batt et al . ( 2004 ) compared the quality , quantity and nature of grey and published evidence on costs and cost - effectiveness of strategies to increase coverage of routine immunisations in low and middle income countries . 138 Of 34 included studies on effectiveness from the grey literature , 63 % met the quality criteria set for inclusion , while 57 % of published literature met these criteria , suggesting that in this area grey literature is of higher quality . Inclusion of grey literature almost doubled the number of included studies , covered different geographical areas , covered operational research and finance ( rather than the economics and policy - making covered in published literature ) and was more up to date . There were no statistically significant differences between published and grey literature in terms of effectiveness ( final coverage or changes in coverage ) . 138 Summary of evidence on grey literature bias There is good evidence that published literature tends to be more positive about the effectiveness of interventions than corresponding grey literature , although this can vary in individual reviews . The quality of grey literature studies can be higher , lower or the same as the corresponding published studies . Studies of cohorts of meeting abstracts found that a large number of abstracts presented at conference meetings will not be published in full , and the subsequent publication of abstracts is associated with study results ( see Cohorts of meeting abstracts and Pooled analyses of cohort studies ) . Such studies included abstracts of studies on diverse research questions , and it is difficult to exclude the influence of many confounding factors on the association between study results and subsequent full publication . Therefore , findings from such cohort studies provided only indirect evidence on grey literature bias . More direct evidence on grey literature bias came from studies that compared the result of published studies and grey literature within a meta - analysis . Many case studies were identified , but the interpretation of findings from these case studies was complicated due to concern over possible selective reporting . Therefore , empirical studies that used an unbiased sample of multiple meta - analyses provided the most valid evidence on grey literature bias . The updated review identified several recent studies of multiple meta - analyses DOI : 10 . 3310 / hta14080 Health Technology Assessment 2010 ; Vol . 14 : No . 8 © 2010 Queen’s Printer and Controller of HMSO . All rights reserved . 29 in which the results of published studies could be compared with that of grey literature . Available evidence from good quality studies suggested that published studies tend to report a greater treatment effect compared with a more complete set of data from published and unpublished studies , but that for individual reviews the effects may not always be in this direction . Grey literature studies may be relatively small and of relatively poor quality , although again this is not always the case . The impact of grey literature in meta - analysis is usually small , although occasionally data from grey literature may have important clinical implications . A case - by - case approach is required to decide whether grey literature should be comprehensively searched and included in systematic reviews . The inclusion of grey literature may sometimes introduce bias , as will exclusion of grey literature in other cases . 3 , 139 The most commonly included unpublished data used in reviews are conference abstracts , but there are difficulties in using data from abstracts as they provide limited information , may be on partial datasets and may be misleading when compared with later full publications . Evidence on the importance and utility of other types of unpublished material is less clear . Language bias Many prestigious international scientific journals are published in English , and journals published in English are more likely to have greater journal impact factors ( JIF ) . 140 However , writing for journals published in English can be more difficult for researchers who are non - native English speakers . 141 – 143 Quality of studies published in English and non - English languages When fictitious manuscripts with identical methodological flaws were sent to referees , Nylenna et al . ( 1994 ) found that Scandinavian referees awarded higher quality scores to English - language manuscripts than to the manuscripts in a referee’s own national language . 144 Moher et al . ( 1996 ) compared completeness of reporting of 133 trials published in English and 96 trials published in French , German , Italian or Spanish . 145 They found no significant difference between English and non - English trials in the completeness of reporting or overall quality score ( 51 . 0 % versus 46 . 2 % ) . It was therefore concluded that all trial reports should be included in systematic reviews irrespective of the language in which they are published . 145 Junker ( 1998 ) 146 identified deficiencies in the quality of reporting of 32 German and 89 English - language reports of placebo - controlled trials published by the same group of authors . The mean quality score was 8 . 4 ( on a scale of 0 to 18 ) , with a non - significant difference in the mean quality score between English and German - language reports ( 0 . 27 ; 95 % CI : – 0 . 97 to 1 . 52 ) . However , Junker’s assessment is somewhat limited because the investigators looked only at published papers involving German - speaking authors from a single research group . 146 More recently , Moher et al . ( 2003 ) found that there were only minor differences in the quality of reports between RCTs published in English and in non - English languages in a study of 42 meta - analyses . 4 However , Egger et al . ( 2003 ) observed that on average , 115 non - English - language trials tended to include fewer participants , were more likely to show statistically significant results , and were of lower methodological quality , than 485 other trials published in English . 3 Therefore , studies published in languages other than English cannot be generally excluded for the reason of study quality . The previous HTA report on publication bias 2 included a study of multiple meta - analyses 147 and a study that compared 40 pairs of RCTs published in German and in English . 148 Since then , two major HTA - supported studies have been completed and these provide more evidence on the differences in estimated treatment effects between English and non - English language trials in meta - analysis ( see Appendix 12 for details of the six studies included in this section ) . 3 , 4 Comparison of studies published in different languages Egger et al . ( 1997 ) 148 identified 40 pairs of RCTs , each pair comprising an RCT published in German , and a matched RCT by the same author published in English during the same period . The investigators found that design characteristics and quality features were similar between RCTs published in German , and RCTs conducted in Evidence of different types of dissemination bias 30 German - speaking Europe that were published in English . Statistically significant results ( p < 0 . 05 ) were reported in 35 % of German language articles and 62 % of English language articles ( OR 3 . 75 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 25 to 11 . 3 ) . Logistic regression analysis found that a statistically significant finding was the only variable that was associated with a trial’s publication in English - language journals . It was therefore concluded that ‘authors are more likely to publish RCTs in an English language journal if the results were statistically significant’ . 149 A similar study by Heres et al . ( 2004 ) reported similar findings in a comparison of 21 pairs of trials in the field of neuroscience matched by the key authors . 150 In this instance , significant results were reported in 33 % of German - language articles as compared with 57 % of the English - language articles ( Wilcoxon’s test p = 0 . 14 ) . 150 Studies of multiple meta - analyses Direct evidence on the impact of language bias comes from evaluations of multiple meta - analyses where the results of studies on the same research question but published in different languages could be compared ( Appendix 12 ) . Gregoire et al . ( 1995 ) studied meta - analyses published in eight medical journals between January 1991 and April 1993 . 147 They found that 28 of the 36 meta - analyses had language restrictions . By repeating the same searches without language restrictions in these 28 meta - analyses , they identified 19 individual studies that had not been included for language reasons . The inclusion of eight of these 19 studies to the five corresponding meta - analyses did not change the findings . However , inclusion of the other 11 studies to the remaining seven corresponding meta - analyses had the potential to modify the results . The most important difference was the change in the 95 % CI of the overall OR estimated in a meta - analysis of selective decontamination of the digestive tract in intensive care units . The pooled OR was 0 . 70 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 45 to 1 . 09 ) in the original meta - analysis , and this became 0 . 67 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 47 to 0 . 95 ) after including a study published in a Swiss journal . 147 Moher et al . ( 2000 ) examined a set of 19 meta - analyses to investigate whether different estimates of treatment effect were obtained in meta - analyses restricted to English - language studies compared with those without this restriction . Language - restricted meta - analyses , compared with meta - analyses involving non - English language studies , did not differ with respect to the overall estimate of effectiveness ( ROR 0 . 96 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 78 to 1 . 18 ) . 151 Meta - analyses without language restrictions had narrower confidence intervals ( average width 0 . 79 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 51 to 1 . 07 ) compared with language - restricted meta - analyses ( average width 0 . 92 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 53 to 1 . 32 ) , which represents a statistically significant relative difference in precision of 16 % . These findings were limited by small sample size , small sampling frame , limited clinical topics and limited interventions . The meta - analyses that did include non - English - language trials had a very low number of such studies . Moreover , the majority ( 13 / 19 ) of the meta - analyses included only one trial published in languages other than English . 151 A further study using 42 meta - analyses ( including 529 English - and 133 non - English - language trials ) was conducted by Moher and his colleagues ( 2003 ) . 4 , 152 The 42 meta - analyses included 34 meta - analyses of conventional interventions , and eight meta - analyses of complementary and alternative medicine . The exclusion of trials in languages other than English , compared with their inclusion , did not yield a significantly different estimate of treatment effect overall ( ROR 1 . 11 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 92 to 1 . 34 ) , or when the meta - analyses looked only at conventional interventions ( ROR 1 . 02 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 83 to 1 . 26 ) . However , in meta - analyses of complementary medicine , exclusion of non - English trials resulted in a 63 % smaller protective effect ( ROR 1 . 63 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 03 to 2 . 60 ) . The authors concluded that language bias is unlikely to be a problem for many meta - analyses in the field of conventional medicine , but it may substantially alter the results of meta - analyses of complementary medicine . 4 Egger et al . ( 2003 ) provided further empirical evidence by independently examining the influence of non - English - language trials in a sample of meta - analyses . 3 , 153 They identified 50 meta - analyses that included a total of 485 English - language trials and 115 non - English - language trials . Within these meta - analyses , treatment effect estimates were on average 16 % more beneficial in non - English - language trials ( ROR 0 . 84 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 74 to 0 . 97 ) but with considerable heterogeneity . Excluding non - English - language studies led to a variety of changes , from a reduction in benefit of 42 % to an increase of 23 % . The exclusion of non - English - language studies resulted in greater benefit of the intervention in five meta - analyses , reduction in benefit in 16 meta - analyses , with little or no effect ( < 5 % ) in 29 meta - analyses . The average precision of treatment effect estimates decreased DOI : 10 . 3310 / hta14080 Health Technology Assessment 2010 ; Vol . 14 : No . 8 © 2010 Queen’s Printer and Controller of HMSO . All rights reserved . 31 from 8 . 34 to 7 . 68 after exclusion of non - English language trials . 3 Summary of evidence on language bias The impact of excluding non - English - language studies in systematic reviews appears to be highly heterogeneous . Different types of non - English - language studies ( involving different areas of health care , and from different countries ) may either be more or less likely to show statistically significant effects than comparable English - language studies , and they may be of lower or similar methodological quality . However , a common finding was that exclusion of non - English - language studies reduced the precision of the estimate of effect . While there are specific areas where omitting non - English - language studies appears to result in a very high risk of bias ( studies in the area of complementary medicine , for example ) their exclusion in other areas may , or may not , result in bias . If exclusion does result in bias it is impossible to assess beforehand which direction this bias may take , as it may inflate or deflate the apparent effect size . This will be difficult to assess unless non - English - language studies are first included and later excluded . The best way to ensure that a review does not contain language bias is to search for and include relevant non - English language studies . The cost - effectiveness of this strategy ( given the additional searching and translation time and costs ) is unclear . Citation bias In published articles , references to other studies are cited for various reasons , for example , to show the importance of a research question , to borrow methods and techniques , or to give positive credit to the material referenced . 154 The chance of a study being cited by others may be associated with many factors like the journal impact factor , nationality of authors , working partnerships , etc . Citation bias occurs when the probability that a study will be cited is associated with the study result . The previous HTA report 2 in 2000 included several studies that provided empirical evidence on citation bias . 155 – 160 Five recently published empirical studies on citation bias were identified in this updated review ( see Appendix 13 for the included studies ) . 161 – 165 The previously cited studies will be discussed first , followed by the newer studies . Shadish et al . ( 1995 ) randomly selected one citation from each of 283 articles published in three psychological journals and asked each author about the most important reason for citing the selected references . 155 It was found that citation was most commonly used to support the author’s argument , while study quality was not considered in most cases . 155 In one study examining the judgement and decision literature , it was found that poor - performance results were significantly more likely to be cited than positive good - performance results . 156 This could not be explained by the journal’s popularity or the year of publication . This did suggest citation bias but the results were questionable since the poor - performance and good - performance articles were published in different journals and reported different evidence . 166 Gotzsche ( 1987 ) examined the existence of citation bias by using 111 comparative trials on non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs . 157 The trial result was defined as positive if the benefit : harm ratio was in favour of the experimental drug . The pattern of citation was then classified as positive , neutral or negative selection of references by comparing the proportion of references reporting positive and negative results . For example , selection was classified as positive when the proportion of trials with a positive outcome in the reference list was higher than that in all available trials . Among the 76 trials in which citation bias was probable , the selection of references was classified as neutral in 10 , negative in 22 , and positive in 44 . In conclusion , positive selection of references is more likely to happen than neutral and negative selection , suggesting citation bias . 157 Ravnskov ( 1995 ) examined citations in three authoritative reviews on diet – heart issues and found that only one of six relevant RCTs with a negative outcome was cited and by only one of the three reviews . However , two , four and six non - randomised trials with a positive outcome were cited in each review respectively , suggesting that ‘fundamental parts of the diet - heart idea are based on biased quotations’ . 158 Hutchison et al . ( 1995 ) assessed citation bias by comparing the proportion of relevant supportive and non - supportive trials used in 17 reviews on the clinical effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccine . Supportive trials were defined as those that reported significantly fewer failures in vaccinated Evidence of different types of dissemination bias 32 subjects than among the controls . It was found that unsupportive trials were more likely to be cited than supportive trials ( 11 . 9 % versus 5 . 8 % ) . The tendency to cite recent trials may be one reason for this disproportionate citation of unsupportive studies because six of the seven trials published after 1980 were unsupportive and all seven trials published before 1980 were supportive . 159 In an assessment by Song et al . ( 1997 ) of published narrative reviews on the prophylactic removal of impacted third molars , it was found that reviews with similar aims included very different evidence on which to draw conclusions . 160 Of 69 studies that were discussed in nine general reviews about the association between pathology and impacted third molars , one was quoted in five reviews while 43 were cited only once . This discrepancy in the use of relevant studies cannot be reasonably explained by the year of publication or quality criteria . This selective citation of studies corresponded with conflicting conclusions from these narrative reviews . 160 Five more recent studies have been added to this update . Chapman et al . ( 2009 ) examined association between citation frequency and reported prevalence in studies of smoking among schizophrenia patients . 162 They found that a 10 % increase in reported prevalence of smoking was associated with a 61 % ( 95 % CI : 30 % to 98 % ) increase in citation rate . 162 Another study by Callaham et al . ( 2002 ) evaluated how 204 emergency medicine studies presented to a meeting in 1991 were cited , and the factors associated with citation . 161 Predictors for citation frequency were the impact factor of the journal , the presence of a control group , newsworthiness score and sample size , while biased citation of positive outcomes was not observed . 161 Kjaergard and Gluud ( 2002 ) reviewed 530 hepato - biliary disease trials to assess whether trials with statistically significant outcomes were cited more often than those with non - significant results . 163 They found a significant positive association between a statistically significant study outcome and citation frequency . The citation frequency was also associated with disease area and adequate generation of allocation sequence . 163 In another study of 368 research papers published in four psychiatric journals , Nieminen et al . ( 2007 ) found that citation rate was related to p - value . 164 Median number of citations for papers reporting ‘significant’ and ‘non - significant’ results was 33 versus 16 respectively . Compared with studies with non - significant results , the ratio of citation rate for studies with significant results was 1 . 63 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 32 to 2 . 02 ) . 164 Schmidt and Gotzsche ( 2005 ) investigated reference bias in 42 narrative reviews of physical interventions on house dust mite antigens . 165 Reference selection in each review was classified as positive , neutral or negative according to whether the proportion of trials with a statistically significant outcome in the review was higher than that among all trials available . For example , positive selection of references meant that the proportion of studies with positive results cited in a review was higher than the proportion of positive trials in all relevant trials available . Of the 38 reviews in which physical interventions were recommended , 10 reviews were neutral in terms of reference selection , 27 reviews had a positive selection of references and one a negative selection . The four reviews that did not recommend physical interventions all had a negative selection of references . 165 Summary of evidence on citation bias Empirical evidence indicates that studies with positive or significant results are on average associated with a higher frequency of citation , although this may not always be the case in specific areas of the literature . Non - systematic narrative reviews are a specific area where biased citation of research findings can result in misleading conclusions . Duplicate ( multiple ) publication Duplicate , redundant , repetitive or multiple publications are defined as submission of similar manuscripts to more than one journal or the republication of the same data in two or more journals . 167 It has been estimated that 10 – 25 % of the published literature in biomedical sciences represents duplicate or redundant publications . 168 The publications may overlap partially or completely , representing a similar portion or major component of a study , and may share the same hypotheses , methods , results and / or discussion . Multiple publications of the same data in different journals has been condemned mainly for wasting journal space and editors’ and referees’ time , as well as readers’ time . 167 , 169 – 171 However , publication of the same data in different ways may help to DOI : 10 . 3310 / hta14080 Health Technology Assessment 2010 ; Vol . 14 : No . 8 © 2010 Queen’s Printer and Controller of HMSO . All rights reserved . 33 disseminate important research results , providing any previous or parallel publications have been explicitly referenced . However , researchers and journal editors may have different understanding about duplicate publication and it is sometimes difficult to distinguish the unacceptable redundant publication from the acceptable ‘parallel’ publication . 172 Recently , a database of duplicate publication and potential plagiarism ( Déjà vu ) has been developed by using a text similarity algorithm to identify extremely similar references from MEDLINE . 173 Duplicate publication can be classified as ‘overt’ or ‘covert’ . 174 Overt duplicate publication is defined as reanalysis of data from a study with appropriate cross - referencing of original reports . Covert duplicate publication is when the same data are published in different places or at different times without adequate reference to a previous or parallel publication . Bias may be introduced in systematic reviews by including data from the same study more than once because of covert duplicate publication . Empirical evidence on duplicate publication bias The previous HTA report on publication bias included several case studies that provided empirical evidence on duplicate publication bias . 22 , 174 – 176 No new published studies and only one conference abstract were identified in this updated review . Gotzsche ( 1989 ) examined 44 multiple publications of 31 controlled trials of NSAIDs in rheumatoid arthritis and found important reported differences in design , exclusion of protocol violators , number of effect variables , number of side effects , and the significance levels between duplicated publications of the same studies . 175 The conclusion became more positive for the new drugs in the late publications of three trials . He also suggested that multiple publications were difficult to detect because the first author and the number of authors cited often differ . 175 Tramer et al . ( 1997 ) assessed the impact in a meta - analysis of duplicate data on efficacy estimates of ondansetron on postoperative emesis . It was found that , for three trials that were published in six reports , there was no cross - referencing . 174 The estimated number - needed - to - treat ( NNT ) to prevent one vomit within 24 hours was 9 . 5 ( 95 % CI : 6 . 9 to 15 ) in 16 non - duplicated reports and 3 . 9 ( 95 % CI : 3 . 3 to 4 . 8 ) in the three reports that were duplicated . The efficacy was overestimated by including duplicated data ( NNT = 4 . 9 ; 95 % CI : 4 . 4 to 5 . 6 ) compared with the report without duplicated data ( NNT = 6 . 4 ; 95 % CI : 5 . 3 to 7 . 9 ) . Tramer et al . also discussed difficulties in identifying duplicated publications of the same trial data . For example , the same trial might report a different number of patients or different patient characteristics , or use completely different authors in separate publications . 174 Huston and Moher ( 1996 ) found that identifying the data from single centres of multicentre trials of risperidone for schizophrenia was far from simple because of the chronology of publications , changing authorship , lack of transparency in reporting , and frequent citation of abstracts and unpublished reports . 176 For example , a North American trial had been reported in part , transparently , and not so transparently , in six different publications by using different author names . It had also been cited in several unpublished forms . 176 Easterbrook et al . ( 1991 ) conducted a survey of studies approved by an REC and found that studies with significant results were more likely to generate multiple publications and more likely to be published in journals with a high citation impact factor when compared with those with non - significant results . 22 Vandekerckhove et al . ( 1993 ) identified a review of RCTs of infertility treatment and found that ‘six studies with a significant result ( but none with a non - significant result ) were reported in four publications from the same institution’ . 177 The updating identified only an abstract by Martin et al . ( 2004 ) in which they examined the impact of including duplicate publications in a meta - analysis of off - pump versus on - pump coronary artery bypass surgery . 178 Trials were classified as covert duplicates when there was no citation of the original publication and non - covert duplicates when the publication declared the duplication or cited the original publication . The authors found that a total of 15 ( 34 % ) of the 44 trials were duplicate publications . Of the 15 duplicate published trials , 10 were covert and five were non - covert publications . However , there was no significant difference in the estimate of mortality when duplicates were included ( OR 0 . 85 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 46 to 1 . 57 ) or not included ( OR 0 . 86 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 48 to 1 . 54 ) . 178 Evidence of different types of dissemination bias 34 Summary of evidence on duplicate bias We identified only very limited empirical evidence from case studies about the existence of duplicate publication bias . However , it is clear that covert duplicate publication of data from the same study may introduce bias in systematic reviews as the weights carried by particular studies are magnified . Place of publication bias Ben - Shlomo and Davey - Smith ( 1994 ) found that the BMJ published more research articles supporting the ‘early life hypothesis’ ( about the impact of early life development on the risk of adult disease ) than the The Lancet . 179 They suggested that there may be ‘place of publication’ bias because , for reasons of editorial policy or readers’ preference , one journal is more enthusiastic towards publishing articles about a given hypothesis than other journals . 179 In a study that compared published and registered trials in advanced ovarian cancer , Simes ( 1986 ) found that trials with significant results ( p < 0 . 05 ) in favour of the treatment tended to be published in prominent journals ( such as the New England Journal of Medicine and Cancer ) , while trials with non - significant results tended to be published in less widely circulated journals . 127 Bero et al . ( 1994 ) compared 297 symposium articles in journal supplements and a sample of 100 journal articles on environmental tobacco smoking published between 1995 and 1993 , and found that ‘symposium articles were more likely to agree with the tobacco industry’s position ( 46 % vs . 20 % ) ’ . 180 This updated review includes a study by Penel and Adenis 181 that examined the association between the results of 74 phase II trials investigating anticancer targeted therapies and the impact factors of journals publishing these trials . Positive trials were defined as those with an objective response rate equal or superior to the prespecified efficacy threshold , and negative trials were those with a response rate lower than expected . It was found that positive results were more likely to be published in journals with high impact factors , compared with negative results ( p = 0 . 004 ; median 6 . 14 versus 2 . 71 ) . 181 We also identified a new study on location bias that examined the results of clinical trials of complementary and alternative medicine ( CAM ) therapies published in mainstream medical journals or in complementary medicine journals . Pittler et al . ( 2000 ) identified 19 systematic reviews that included 351 controlled trials of complementary medicine . 182 Mainstream medical journals with a high impact factor tended to publish a relatively low proportion of trials with significant results compared with complementary medicine journals ( 50 % versus 63 % ) . They suspected that ‘this may reflect the reluctance of authors to submit positive trial reports to these “flagship” orthodox journals , perceiving them to be hostile to CAM’ . 182 Country bias The causes of variable results from studies on the same topic between different countries are complex , and selective publication is only one possible explanation . The variable results between different countries were studied by Ottenbacher and DiFabio ( 1985 ) . 183 They observed that the estimated efficacy of spinal manipulation therapy was greater in studies reported in English - language journals published outside the USA than for similar studies in journals published in the USA ( average effect size 0 . 45 versus 0 . 29 ) . It was suggested that this finding might be explained by the existence of publication bias and / or other intervention characteristics . 183 A study by Vickers et al . ( 1998 ) examined 666 abstracts from MEDLINE of clinical trials published up to 1995 . 184 The proportion of positive results ( when the test treatment was superior to control ) in trials comparing acupuncture with controls was 100 % for 50 trials originating from China , Taiwan , Japan and Hong Kong . 184 Conversely the results were 56 . 7 % for 180 trials originating from 14 western countries such as the USA , UK , Sweden , Denmark , Germany and Canada . The study also identified that the percentage of positive results in trials of interventions other than acupuncture was 99 % for trials originating from China , 97 % from the USSR / Russia , 95 % from Taiwan , 89 % from Japan and 75 % from England . It was concluded that publication bias was a possible explanation for the unusually high proportions of positive results reported from some countries . 184 Tang et al . ( 1999 ) confirmed the existence of publication bias in Chinese journals of traditional medicine by presenting an asymmetric funnel plot of 49 trials of acupuncture in the treatment of stroke . 185 Continuing the theme of more positive results appearing in published work from specific countries , Pan et al . ( 2005 ) explored country DOI : 10 . 3310 / hta14080 Health Technology Assessment 2010 ; Vol . 14 : No . 8 © 2010 Queen’s Printer and Controller of HMSO . All rights reserved . 35 bias in the area of genetic epidemiology . 186 They worked with 13 gene - disease associations with existing meta - analyses of at least 15 non - Chinese studies and searched for relevant Chinese studies . Of the 161 studies found ( augmenting the 301 non - Chinese studies already included in the meta - analyses ) only 20 were included in MEDLINE . Despite having smaller sample sizes than the non - Chinese studies , significantly more Chinese studies showed statistically significant associations ( 48 % versus 18 % ) and the largest effects were seen in the small sample of MEDLINE indexed Chinese studies . This reinforces the finding that there are large bodies of literature that are commonly missed from meta - analyses using only MEDLINE , but that such bodies may display high levels of publication bias so that caution is needed in interpreting the results of such groups . Lack of publication by authors from developing countries may lead to ‘country bias’ , both under - representing the research questions of such areas and causing an important gap in our ability to locate and synthesise the results of the whole body of conducted research . For example , King ( 2004 ) found that 31 countries accounted for 98 % of the world’s highly cited papers , the remaining 192 countries accounting for less than 2 % . 187 If the results of such studies are different from the results of similar studies by researchers from developed nations then we will observe publication bias . Database indexing bias Database indexing bias occurs when there is biased indexing of published studies in literature databases . 188 A literature database , such as MEDLINE or EMBASE , may not include and index all published studies on a topic . 189 – 191 The literature search will be biased when it is based on a database in which the results of indexed studies are systematically different from those of non - indexed studies . This bias is likely because the result of a study may determine whether and where the study is published . This updated review identified no new studies on database indexing bias . The following two studies were included in the previous HTA report . A study by Zielinski in 1995 estimated that about 98 % of journals indexed in the major literature databases were from western developed countries . 192 Nieminen and Isohanni ( 1999 ) suggested that there was a bias against European journals in medical literature databases because 27 % of psychiatric research papers by Finnish authors published in English were not indexed in MEDLINE . 193 Media attention bias The general population gets most of its information about the latest developments in science and medicine from the popular media . How the press presents the findings of these developments has a very powerful influence on public perception . Media attention bias occurs when studies with striking results are more likely to be covered by newspapers , radio and television news . The overly optimistic portrayal of the scientific findings to the public affects the public participation in policy discussions and creates unrealistic expectation of the potential benefits of a new scientific development . 194 It was not clear whether media coverage was influenced by people’s opinions about what is important , or whether people’s judgements were influenced by the media coverage , although both directions of influence are possible . 195 The 2000 HTA report on publication bias 2 included limited evidence on media attention bias . Combs and Slovic in 1979 found that the coverage by two newspapers in the USA about causes of death was not related to the statistical frequency of their occurrence . 195 The newspaper overemphasised homicides , accidents and disasters , and under - reported diseases as causes of death . Violent accidents and homicides make more interesting and exciting stories than diseases . 195 Houn et al . ( 1995 ) examined the popular press coverage of research in the USA in 1985 and in 1992 on the association between alcohol and breast cancer . 196 They identified 58 scientific articles and 89 newspaper or magazine stories . Only 11 of these 58 scientific articles were cited in the newspaper or magazine stories . Press stories cited all scientific articles that were published in JAMA and the NEJM but articles published in other journals were often ignored by the newspaper and magazine reports . There was no significant difference between the scientific articles and press stories in the frequency of reporting positive , negative or neutral results . It was concluded that ‘the vast majority of scientific studies on alcohol and breast cancer were ignored in press reports’ . 196 Koren and Klein ( 1991 ) 197 compared newspaper coverage in the USA of one positive study that reported a significant association between radiation exposure and cancer risk 198 and one negative study Evidence of different types of dissemination bias 36 that did not , 199 published in the same issue of JAMA in 1991 . Nine of the 19 newspaper reports covered only the positive study . In the other 10 reports that covered both the positive and the negative studies , the average number of words was 354 for the positive result and 192 for the negative result . It was suggested that the number , length and quality of newspaper reports on the positive study were greater than news reports on the negative study , which suggests a bias against news reports of studies that show no effects or no adverse effects . 197 This updated review identified two studies that examined the media coverage of abstracts presented at scientific meetings . Schwartz et al . ( 2002 ) examined 252 news stories about 147 research articles presented at scientific meetings in 1998 , and found that the 43 abstracts that received prominent news coverage were no more likely to be formally published . 200 Woloshin and Schwartz ( 2006 ) found that the media coverage of scientific meetings in major international outlets in 2003 often failed to report basic study facts , so that the public would be likely to be misled about the validity and relevance of the science presented , especially as there were no published findings to refer back to for confirmation . 201 Whiteman et al . ( 2001 ) examined the scientific publications that do and do not support an association between hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) and breast cancer to assess whether they were cited in the popular media in similar proportions . 202 A total of 32 scientific publications were identified , 20 ( 63 % ) of which had positive conclusions in which the results supported the HRT – breast cancer association , and 12 ( 38 % ) did not . Of the 203 citations in the media reports , 82 % were of positive studies and 18 % were of negative studies , representing a significant excess of citations of positive publications ( p < 0 . 01 ) . 202 The reporting of clinical trials of herbal remedies by the popular media may be influenced by the disclosure of funding information and competing interest in the scientific and medical literature . Koper et al . ( 2006 ) 203 used a coding frame analysis technique to systematically compare newspaper articles with the reporting of the same trials in the medical literature . The analysis of 389 newspaper articles from the UK , USA and Canada indicated that media coverage of conflicts of interest had an effect on the overall tone of the article . 203 Limitations of the available evidence Empirical studies on publication and related biases have focused mainly on certain areas of research such as clinical trials of health - care interventions . There is only very limited evidence on publication bias in many other research fields including basic research and observational studies . Studies of publication and related biases themselves may be as vulnerable as other studies to the selective publication and reporting of significant or striking findings . 1 Much of the empirical evidence comes from case reports that may be selectively reported because of their striking findings . Studies that are less selective are able to provide more convincing evidence on publication and related biases , including cohorts of research protocols , submitted or registered studies . However , many empirical studies were based on cohorts of studies that were diverse in terms of design and research questions . It is usually impossible to exclude the impact of confounding factors on the observed association between study results and publication status . There is very limited and conflicting evidence on factors that may be associated with the direction and extent of publication and related biases . Findings from individual empirical studies were often heterogeneous , and pooled estimates of publication and related biases can indicate some average trends but may not be generalisable to many individual cases . A case - by - case approach is required to gauge the possible impact of publication and related biases and to decide appropriate measures to deal with these biases . Conclusions The 2000 HTA report included very limited evidence on outcome reporting bias . Recently published studies have provided convincing evidence that outcome reporting bias exists and is likely to have important effects on pooled summary data within systematic reviews . Limited evidence indicates that harm and subjectively assessed outcomes may be more vulnerable to biased selective reporting than efficacy and objectively assessed outcomes .

However , new evidence is less clear about time lag bias than was suggested in the previous review . One consequence of time lag bias would be a diminishing effect size reported by studies over time , although very limited research has been conducted to investigate temporal trends of reported effect size in meta - analysis . The updated review identified substantially new evidence on grey literature bias . Evidence suggests that published studies tend to report a greater treatment effect than those of grey literature or unpublished studies . However , for individual cases , the direction of bias is unpredictable , and grey literature studies may be relatively small and of poor quality , although this is not always the case . In some reviews inclusion of data from grey literature or unpublished studies have important clinical implications . Substantially new evidence on language bias has been identified . The impact of excluding non - English - language studies from systematic reviews was highly heterogeneous . Exclusion of non - English - language studies from systematic reviews may be associated with greater , similar or smaller estimates of treatment effects . However , exclusion of non - English - language studies appears to result in a particularly high risk of bias in some areas of research such as complementary and alternative medicine . Empirical evidence indicates that studies with significant or positive results are on average associated with a higher frequency of citation . Non - systematic narrative reviews are a specific area where biased citation of research findings can result in misleading conclusions . The updated review identified very limited new evidence on duplicate publication bias , although it is clear that covert duplicate publication of data may introduce bias in systematic reviews . Available evidence on the existence of place of publication bias , database or index bias , country bias and media attention bias is still very limited . The impact of these biases could be prevented in well - conducted systematic reviews . 204 There is limited evidence on place of publication bias , database bias , country bias and media attention bias . It is helpful to be aware of the potential existence of these biases . DOI : 10 . 3310 / hta14080 Health Technology Assessment 2010 ; Vol . 14 : No . 8 © 2010 Queen’s Printer and Controller of HMSO .

As a direct consequence of publication and related biases , published studies may provide misleading estimates of treatment effects or associations between variables . The previous 2000 HTA report identified very little direct evidence on the impact of publication and related biases on health policy , clinical decision - making and the outcome of patient management . 2 In this updated review , we considered consequences of publication bias according to types of studies , classifying them into three categories : basic research , observational studies and clinical trials . Basic research studies Many new treatments are initially investigated in basic laboratory and animal research . Based on findings from basic research , clinical trials may be conducted to test an intervention in humans . However , subsequent clinical trials often fail to provide confirmatory positive results , inconsistent with findings from basic animal research . 205 One of several possible explanations for the observed discrepancies in results between basic research and clinical trials is biased publication of positive results of basic studies . 206 If positive results from basic research are more likely to be published than negative results , results of published studies of basic research will represent an overestimation of potential treatment effects . It is unlikely that clinical trials that are designed based on false - positive findings from basic research will provide a positive result . Empirical evidence on the existence and impact of publication bias is very limited in the field of basic laboratory and animal research . This updated review included a case study of a neuroprotective drug , nicotinamide , for focal cerebral ischaemia in animal experimental studies . 132 The animal experimental studies suggested potential efficacy of neuroprotective drugs , but clinical trials failed to confirm these drugs’ efficacy . Macleod et al . ( 2004 ) conducted a systematic review of animal experimental studies of nicotinamide . They found that animal studies that were fully published showed a greater effect ( effect size 0 . 306 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 241 to 0 . 371 ) than studies that were presented in abstract form ( 0 . 162 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 066 to 0 . 258 ) . It was suspected that some studies with negative results may not be available even in abstract form . 132 Observational studies A large number of epidemiological studies have been conducted to investigate various risk factors associated with diseases . 207 However , there are contradictory findings from epidemiological studies regarding many risk factors . 208 For example , the results of epidemiological studies were contradictory regarding the risk of hair dyes , coffee , oat bran , oral contraceptives , environmental exposure to residential radon , and the presence of DDT metabolites in the bloodstream . 209 Ioannidis and Trikalinos found that early published studies of genetic associations tended to be extremely contradictory , and hypothesised that ‘highly contradictory results are most tantalizing and attractive to investigators and editors’ . 112 Two further studies ( all by Ioannidis and his colleagues ) found considerable outcome reporting bias in studies of cancer prognostic factors , 97 and in studies of epidemiological risks . 98 Therefore , publication and related biases may be an important reason for many of the controversies surrounding the results of epidemiological studies . Clinical trials The impact of publication bias in clinical trials will depend on the extent of bias , and the underlying effects evaluated . The worst scenario would be where a harmful intervention is falsely reported as effective because of publication bias , which may result in patients receiving a harmful treatment . If an ineffective intervention is falsely considered as effective , patients may receive an ineffective treatment and be denied effective treatments . For an effective intervention , its effects may be Chapter 5 Consequences of dissemination bias Consequences of dissemination bias 40 overestimated because of publication bias . New interventions are generally more expensive than conventional interventions , so overestimation of the efficacy of new interventions is likely to result in increased cost without a corresponding improvement in outcome . A perinatal trial observed that routine hospitalisation was associated with more unwanted outcomes in women with uncomplicated twin pregnancies , but this finding remained unpublished for 7 years . 210 Chalmers pointed out that ‘at the very least , this delay led to continued inappropriate deployment of limited resources ; at worst , it may have resulted in the continued use of a harmful policy’ . 210 The non - publication of research findings may indirectly harm patients who are involved in future research . For example , a clinical study may find that an intervention is harmful but this finding is not published . Other investigators may subsequently repeat the same research , testing the harmful treatment on different patients . In 1980 , a trial tested lorcainide in patients with acute and recovering myocardial infarction . More deaths were observed in the lorcainide group than in the placebo group ( 9 / 48 versus 1 / 47 ) . 211 The trial results were not published because the development of lorcainide was stopped for ‘commercial reasons’ . About a decade later , an increased mortality was observed among patients treated with the related agents , encainide and flecainide , in two trials . 212 , 213 Encainide , flecainide and lorcainide all belong to a class of I C antiarrhythmic agents . If the results of the trial in 1980 had been published , the increased mortality of patients included in the two later trials might have been avoided . Recently there were several high - profile cases of alleged publication or reporting bias in drug trials . Rofecoxib was withdrawn from the market by Merck on 30 September 2004 , because of increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke according to unpublished data from a clinical trial . 214 Editors of NEJM expressed their concern about a trial of rofecoxib , published in the journal in 2000 , in which three cases of myocardial infarction were not disclosed in the article . 215 Although authors of the trial denied any wrongdoing , 216 the NEJM editors restated their concern . 217 Further , in the year before the withdrawal , the authors of a systematic review had written directly to the primary author of every published trial of rofecoxib asking about cardiovascular events and major bleeds ; however , they received only a single reply and it did not provide data on cardiovascular events . 218 In a more recent case study , Psaty and Kronmal ( 2008 ) found biased reporting of findings from clinical trials of rofecoxib for Alzheimer’s disease or cognitive impairment . 219 Before its withdrawal , rofecoxib had been used in more than 80 million patients . 214 Biased reporting of findings from trials may have encouraged more patients to use rofecoxib and delayed the detection of harmful effects of rofecoxib . In 2003 , medicine regulatory authorities in several countries advised that a new antidepressant , paroxetine , should not be used in children with depression ( with several other SSRIs added to the list later on ) , based mainly on findings from unpublished trials from industry . 220 , 221 This case actually suggests that formal publication may not be the most effective and timely approach to disseminating important research findings . Findings from clinical trials indicated that these SSRI antidepressants were ineffective and associated with increased suicidality and aggression in children with depression . Kondro and Sibbald ( 2004 ) revealed a drug company’s internal document in which staff were advised to withhold data about SSRI use in children . 222 and GlaxoSmithKline was threatened with legal action over concealment of trial results . 223 A meta - analysis by Turner et al . examined 74 FDA - registered clinical trials of antidepressants and found that trials with positive results were more likely to be published than those with negative results . 45 Ioannidis suspected that some relevant trials conducted after market approval may not be included even in the FDA database . 224 Summary The most important consequences of publication bias include avoidable suffering of patients and waste of limited resources . This updated review identified only a couple of new cases that indicate the detrimental impact of publication and related biases . Consequences of publication and related biases are different for different types of research studies . Because of the possibility of such bias , the integrity of scientific research could have been jeopardised .

This chapter provides an updated review of evidence about the responsibility of investigators , journal editors or peer - reviewers , and research sponsors for the existence of publication bias . Other study - level factors ( including sample size , underlying true effect , study design and quality ) that may exacerbate the risk of publication of a biased selection of studies are then discussed . Investigators and authors There are various reasons for not writing up an article or not submitting it , such as pressure from research sponsors and instructions from journal editors . The previous HTA report 2 included nine studies of reasons given by investigators for not publishing studies . 20 – 22 , 30 , 50 , 54 , 228 – 230 We identified an additional 12 studies in this updated review ( Appendix 14 ) . 28 , 35 , 67 , 70 , 72 , 231 – 237 It should be noted that studies often used different ways to categorise reasons for non - publication and reasons given in a study may not be independent of each other . For example , citing ‘result not important enough’ as the reason may be the cause of other given reasons such as ‘not worth the trouble’ and ‘not enough time’ . Studies included in the previous HTA report and those newly identified reported similar reasons for not publishing ( Appendix 14 ) . Of the 21 studies included , there are five studies of investigators of protocol cohorts , 11 studies of authors of meeting abstracts , and five studies of other or miscellaneous authors . Percentages of specific reasons from individual studies were transformed to log odds and pooled using random - effects model , although there was significant heterogeneity across studies ( Figure 7 ) . The main reasons for non - publication were lack of time or low priority ( 34 . 5 % ; 95 % CI : 27 . 4 % to 42 . 3 % ) , results not important enough ( 19 . 6 % ; 95 % CI : 12 . 0 % to 30 . 4 % ) and journal rejection ( 10 . 2 % ; 95 % CI : 5 . 5 % to 18 . 2 % ) ( see Figure 7 ) . Pooled percentages of specific reasons were similar across different types of empirical studies , except that the lack of time or low interest were significantly higher in studies of meeting abstracts ( 43 . 1 % ; 95 % CI : 35 . 9 % to 50 . 6 % ) than in studies of protocol cohorts ( 23 . 8 % ; 95 % CI : 15 . 9 % to 34 . 0 % ) or studies of other authors ( 20 . 7 % ; 95 % CI : 7 . 7 % to 44 . 9 % ) ( see Figure 7 ) . In the five studies of meeting abstracts , fear of journal rejection was given as a reason for 23 . 7 % ( 95 % CI : 8 . 9 % to 49 . 6 % ) of unpublished studies . It should be noted that ‘lack of time’ may be more likely used as the excuse for not publishing unimportant results . The same researcher may have several different simultaneous studies that need attention , and may be reluctant to spend already limited time on the preparation of manuscripts for studies with unimportant or non - significant results that are less likely to be accepted by high - profile journals . In a qualitative study of causes of publication bias in genetic epidemiology , an experienced researcher in genetic epidemiology admitted that because of time constraints and ‘piles’ of results available , efforts will inevitably focus on the publication of ‘wonderful results’ , not ‘negative results’ . 84 These findings indicated that investigators may be the main source of publication bias , for not writing up or submitting studies with ‘unimportant’ results . Blumenthal et al . conducted a postal survey of 3394 life sciences faculty members at 50 universities that received the most funding from the NIH in 1993 . 231 Delay to publication by more than 6 months in the last 3 years was reported at least once by 19 % of the 2167 respondents . Principal reasons given by respondents for delay to publication included patent application submission ( 46 % ) , protection of scientific lead ( 31 % ) , patent negotiation ( 26 % ) , time for resolution of intellectual property ownership ( 17 % ) and slow dissemination of undesired results ( 28 % ) . 231 According to a recent survey of 119 authors of papers published in six general medical journals , authors still considered that good study quality , Chapter 6 Sources of publication bias Sources of publication bias 42 Cactus Design and Illustration Ltd Figure Number : 00 . 07 . ai Title : 06 - 92 - 02 Proof Stage : 2 T o t a l E s t i m a t e ( % a n d 95 % C I ) Lack of time or not interested 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Results not important Rejected by journal Fear of being rejected P r o t o c o l A b s t r a c t O t h e r T o t a l P r o t o c o l A b s t r a c t O t h e r T o t a l T o t a l P r o t o c o l A b s t r a c t A b s t r a c t O t h e r FiGure 7 Reasons given by investigators for not publishing : scatter plot . manuscript writing and statistical significance of results were important factors associated with the possibility of a study being published . 238 Findings from surveys of investigators are supported by evidence from other studies . Stern and Simes found that quantitative studies with significant results were more likely to be submitted than studies with null results ( 78 % versus 54 % , p < 0 . 001 ) . 24 Ioannidis found that studies with positive results were often submitted for publication more rapidly after completion than were negative studies . 23 Cain and Detsky believed that even physicians can be biased . 227 A study investigating enthusiasm for radiotherapy after radical mastectomy when stage was not distinguished showed 21 out of 29 radiotherapists were enthusiastic compared with 5 out of 34 authors in other specialties . 239 A systematic review of risk of strokes and death following endarterectomy for symptomatic carotid stenosis showed a higher risk in studies where neurologists assessed the patients and lowest where the single author was affiliated to a department of surgery ( 7 . 7 % versus 2 . 3 % ) . 240 Authors’ criteria for selecting journals was investigated in a study of all active clinical and research faculty at Stanford University School of Medicine . 241 A response rate of 63 . 7 % with factors ranked from unimportant ( 1 ) to very important ( 6 ) showed journal prestige ( 5 . 2 ) , makeup of journal’s readership ( 4 . 8 ) , whether the journal publishes articles on the topic ( 4 . 8 ) and likelihood of manuscript acceptance ( 4 . 4 ) to be the important factors at primary submission . For subsequent submission , manuscript acceptance ( 5 . 0 ) and whether the manuscript usually publishes articles on the topic ( 4 . 7 ) were the most important factors determining submission . 241 McCambridge ( 2007 ) discussed a case of publication bias in reviews of drug education . 242 A series of systematic reviews of drug education in schools were conducted by Tobler et al . , and formally published in 1986 , 1997 and 2000 . 243 – 245 Findings from these reviews indicated that interventions delivered by mental health clinicians were more effective than those by others ; and interactive programmes were effective and non - interactive programmes were not . These findings have had considerable impact on research , policy and practice . Through personal communication , McCambridge obtained some unpublished results of updated meta - analysis conducted by the same team of the previous three systematic reviews . 242 According to the unpublished results of updated meta - analysis , differences between different intervention programmes are no longer statistically significant , but these findings have not been formally published in peer - reviewed journals at 4 years after the end of the review project . The non - positive finding is likely to be one of the reasons for non - publication . 242 Editorial review process Editorial policies Little is known about the actual editorial process itself . A semistructured interview of editors of DOI : 10 . 3310 / hta14080 Health Technology Assessment 2010 ; Vol . 14 : No . 8 © 2010 Queen’s Printer and Controller of HMSO . All rights reserved . 43 three leading biomedical journals found a great diversity in editorial policies and procedures between the journals . 246 A retrospective review of studies published in 2006 found that medical journals were more likely to publish reports from their own editorial board than from other journals . 247 Although editorial rejection was not a frequent reason given by investigators for studies remaining unpublished ( see Figure 7 ) , authors may not submit articles with ‘unimportant’ results because of anticipated rejection according to journals’ instructions to authors and their own ( or colleagues’ ) experience . The 2000 HTA report on publication bias included several studies that surveyed authors or investigators about manuscript submission for publication . 23 , 230 , 248 A study by Weber et al . reported that anticipated rejection by journals was cited as a reason for failure to submit a manuscript by 20 % of 179 authors . 230 In another study , 17 of 45 submitted trials were rejected by at least one journal , and at least four negative trials with over 300 patients each were rejected two or three times , while no positive trial was multiply rejected . 23 In a survey of 80 authors of articles published in psychology or educational journals in 1988 , 61 % of the 68 respondents agreed that , if the research result is not statistically significant , there is little chance of the manuscript being published . 248 Several new studies identified in the updated review provide results similar to those reported in the previous studies . 67 , 233 , 236 , 237 Anticipated rejection by journals was the reason for not submitting a study given by 10 % of investigators in the article by Vuckovic Dekic et al . , 237 by 13 % in Hashkes and Uziel , 67 by 13 % in Sprague et al . , 236 and by up to 26 % in Hartling et al . 233 The 2000 HTA report also included several studies that surveyed journal editors . A survey of 429 editors or members of advisory boards of 19 leading journals in management and the related social sciences in 1974 found that non - significant results , replications , lack of new data , similarity to recently published articles , or having previously been presented at meetings were factors associated with reduced chance of acceptance . 249 A survey in 1996 of 36 editors of English - language journals found that editors primarily valued the significance and importance of the research above validity of the experimental and statistical methods . 250 Originality and clinical significance of results are also important criteria for manuscript acceptance . Negative results may have less of an effect on clinical practice , supporting their publication in pay - to - publish journals or open access electronic journals unless they show a widely used intervention is ineffective . 19 , 251 Qualitative criteria for assessing study importance include originality of results , predictability , triviality , narrow interest , highly specialised and few / no clinical implications . 252 Unoriginality accounted for 14 % of all reasons given for rejection of manuscripts in 1989 by the American Journal of Surgery . 253 Confirmatory studies , either positive or negative , have a low chance of being accepted . 254 , 255 The updated review included only one new relevant study that surveyed journal editors . A survey of the editors of 33 medical journals owned by not - for - profit organisations showed that 70 % reported having complete editorial freedom and the remainder reported having a high level of freedom . 256 However , 42 % reported being pressurised by the association’s leadership , 30 % by senior staff and 39 % by rank - and - file members . Ultimately 48 % of the journal’s board of directors had authority to hire and 55 % to fire the editor indicating that editorial independence from journal owners needs protection . 256 Several cases of inappropriate instructions to authors by journal editors that may lead to publication bias were reported in the 2000 HTA report on publication bias . For example , a journal on diabetes clearly stated that ‘mere confirmation of known facts will be accepted only in exceptional cases ; the same applies to reports of experiments and observations having no positive outcome’ . 255 More journal editors may have realised the detrimental impact of selective publication of positive results , and we are not currently aware of explicit journal instructions to authors that may be a cause of publication bias . However , further efforts will be required to translate this change in journal editorial policies to the submission behaviour of authors and investigators . Journal peer review Journal peer review has been defined as ‘the assessment by experts ( peers ) of material submitted for publication in scientific and technical periodicals’ . 257 Unacceptable biases in the peer review process include biases related to certain types of author ( prestige , gender , nationality ) , or certain types of manuscript ( language , innovation , positive / negative results ) . 225 , 258 The process of journal peer reviewing is a complex process and there are many studies on different types of biases in peer reviewing . This report considers only Sources of publication bias 44 biased peer reviewing process as a possible cause of selective publication according to study results . The 2000 HTA report on publication bias included several studies that used sham papers to investigate publication bias in the peer review process . No new relevant studies have been identified in this update review , and studies included in the previous HTA report are discussed below . Mahoney sent a sham paper with identical experimental procedures but different results to 75 journal referees and found poor agreement between reviewers and bias against the manuscript that reported results conflicting with referees’ own perspectives ( confirmatory bias ) . 259 A further study gave a similar result , in which a sham paper about transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) was sent to 33 referees identified as pro - or contra - TENS . 260 Referees’ judgement was associated with preconception and experience , and inter - rater reliability was again found to be poor . 260 Abbot and Ernst sent four versions of a sham study in complementary medicine to 200 authors , and found that the poor quality manuscript was rejected significantly more often than the good quality manuscript ( 55 % versus 16 % ; p < 0 . 05 ) , and no evidence of peer - reviewer bias against a positive or negative outcome . 261 Abstract reviewing may be less predictable than reviewing a full article . Ector et al . compared the agreement between reviewers in grading abstracts submitted to a conference ( the sixth European Symposium on Cardiac Pacing ) . 262 Each abstract was graded on a scale of 1 to 10 by two peer - reviewers . There was no statistically significant correlation between reviewers in 13 of the 28 pairs . It was suggested that reviewing abstracts is less predictable and more likely to be biased than reviewing a full article . 262 A study of 1983 posters submitted for three annual conferences for bias was conducted by Blackburn et al . 263 Posters having authorship that included at least one reviewer received higher ratings than those having only non - reviewing authors . 263 Wager et al . compared reviews from reviewers selected by authors and those selected by editors , and found that reviewer source had no impact on review quality or tone but that author - nominated reviewers were significantly more likely to recommend acceptance and less likely to recommend rejection than editor - chosen reviewers after initial review . 264 Another similar study also found that editor - selected reviewers were less likely to recommend acceptance than author - chosen reviewers , although there was no significant difference in review quality or speed between them . 265 Geographical bias can also influence peer review . In a Scandinavian study , two versions of a sham paper with methodological flaws , one in Scandinavian and one in English , were sent to 180 Scandinavian reviewers . 144 The 156 referees who returned 312 reviews considered the English - language version significantly better than the Scandinavian version ( p < 0 . 05 ) . 144 A retrospective analysis of original submissions received by the journal Gastroenterology in 1995 and 1996 also showed geographical bias . 266 There were 2355 US and 1297 non - US reviewers ( p = 0 . 31 ) , with US reviewers recommending acceptance of papers submitted by US authors more often than non - US reviewers ( p = 0 . 001 ) . Non - US reviewers ranked US papers slightly more favourably than non - US papers ( p = 0 . 09 ) , with US reviewers ranking US papers much more favourably ( p = 0 . 001 ) . 266 However , a study of 3444 papers submitted to the journal Cardiovascular Research between 1997 and 2002 showed that US reviewers assigned significantly higher priority to manuscripts regardless of where the manuscript was from ( p < 0 . 0005 ) . 267 The same study also found that manuscripts received significantly higher priority ratings when reviewers and authors originated from the same country ( p < 0 . 05 ) . 267 Gender bias during peer review of manuscripts and grant proposals has also been demonstrated in several studies . A study of manuscripts received by JAMA in 1991 comprising 1698 male and 462 female authors with eight male editors , five female editors , 2452 male and 930 female reviewers showed significant gender differences . 268 Female editors were assigned manuscripts from females more often than males ( p < 0 . 001 ) . Female editors also used more reviewers per manuscript if sent for other review and rejected more manuscripts ( p < 0 . 001 ) . 268 However , articles submitted were not accepted at significantly different rates based on gender ( p < 0 . 4 ) . A Scandinavian study used a sham paper with either a female or male author to assess gender bias in 1637 randomly selected Swedish physicians . 269 Female authors were ranked higher than male authors , with female assessors upgrading female authors more than male authors and male assessors reflecting no gender differences . 269 A study conducted by Caelleigh et al . of 50 female and 50 male reviewers showed no gender bias when assessing an empirical study with two versions , one attributing lower forecast income of women to DOI : 10 . 3310 / hta14080 Health Technology Assessment 2010 ; Vol . 14 : No . 8 © 2010 Queen’s Printer and Controller of HMSO . All rights reserved . 45 intrinsic gender factors and the other attributing the difference to extrinsic social learning factors . 270 In a retrospective study , the effect of institutional prestige on referees’ recommendation and editorial decision was assessed . 271 Institutional prestige was determined according to the monetary value of research and training grants and contracts funded by the National Institutes of Health . The association between the recommendation for acceptance and institutional prestige was observed for the 147 brief reports ( i . e . case reports and similar short papers ) but not for 258 major papers ( such as case series , research reports and epidemiological studies ) . 271 Study results and journal editorial decisions Rejection by journals was given by investigators as a reason for 5 % to 33 % of non - publication of studies ( see Figure 7 ) . If the decision to accept or reject studies for publication is not based on study findings , the rejection of studies by journals will not result in publication bias . The 2000 HTA report on publication bias included several studies that provided limited evidence on the acceptance of manuscript by study results . Epstein sent two versions of a fictitious paper with either positive or negative results to 146 social work journals . 272 The positive manuscript was accepted in 35 % and the negative manuscript was accepted in 25 % ( p > 0 . 05 ) . 272 A study found that 17 of 45 submitted trials were rejected by at least one journal , four negative trials were rejected two or three times and no positive trial was multiply rejected . 23 However , another study found no difference in the rate of publication of submitted manuscripts between studies with significant results and studies with null results ( 87 % versus 82 % , p = 0 . 54 ) . 24 In a case – control study of 100 accepted and 100 rejected papers in two Spanish medical journals , it was found that publication status was associated with high study quality , not positive findings . 273 The updated review identified four studies that followed cohorts of manuscripts submitted to journals ( Appendix 15 ) . 78 – 81 Results of these four studies of manuscript cohorts have been discussed in Chapter 3 . Two studies examined manuscripts submitted to general medical journals ( JAMA , BMJ , The Lancet , and Annals of Internal Medicine ) 78 , 81 and two used manuscripts submitted to the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery ( American Version ) . 79 , 80 The study results of submitted papers were classified according to the significance of statistical testing ( p < 0 . 05 or not ) in the two studies of manuscripts submitted to general medical journals . 78 , 81 In the studies of manuscripts submitted to the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery , results were classified as being positive , negative or neutral , although the definitions of these outcomes may be different between the two studies ( Appendix 15 ) . 79 , 80 Figure 8 shows the results from the four studies and the pooled odds ratio of acceptance rate ( OR 1 . 06 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 80 to 1 . 39 ) , which suggested that the acceptance of submitted papers for publication by journals was not significantly associated with the direction or strength of their findings . In addition , Olson et al . 81 further examined 133 accepted manuscripts and found that time to publication was not associated with statistical significance ( median 7 . 8 months for positive and 7 . 6 months for negative results , p = 0 . 44 ) . 82 Because the acceptance of manuscripts for publication by journal editors was not determined by the direction or strength of study results , the existence of publication bias may be largely due to biased selection of studies to submit by investigators . This may also be supported by the fact that a large proportion of submitted papers showed statistically significant results ( 51 % to 87 % ) or positive results ( 71 % to 72 % ) in the four cohort studies . Since any author will inevitably consider the possibility of their manuscripts being accepted before submission , submitted studies with negative results may be a biased selection of all studies with negative results . In Olson et al . ’s cohort study of manuscripts submitted to JAMA , there was a tendency that studies with significant results had a higher rate of acceptance than studies with non - significant or unclear results ( 20 . 4 % versus 15 . 2 % , p = 0 . 07 ) . 81 In the cohort study by Okike et al . , a subgroup analysis of 156 manuscripts with a high level of evidence ( level I or II ) found that the acceptance rate was significantly higher for studies with positive or neutral results than for studies with negative results ( 37 % , 36 % and 5 % respectively ; p = 0 . 02 ) . 80 The studies included in Appendix 15 are generally well designed and conducted . Although no conflict of interest was declared in the four cohort studies of submitted manuscripts , this kind of study will always need support or collaboration from editors of the journal .

Unadjusted odds ratio . be influenced by their awareness of the ongoing study . 81 Therefore , biased selection for publication by journals cannot be completely ruled out . Readers and users of research findings Journal editors’ policy may reflect readers’ preferences , and it has been suggested that editors should find ways to incorporate the reader’s perspective into the peer review process and study the effects of their efforts . It is likely that readers’ preferences for certain findings may be an important reason for the biased publication of studies in journals . We have identified no new relevant studies in the updated review , although two studies were discussed in the previous HTA report on publication bias . A survey of 452 readers showed readers were generally satisfied with the quality of manuscripts but dissatisfied with the lack of manuscripts relevant to medical practice . 274 The difference of opinion between readers and peer - reviewers may be attributable to clinicians avoiding unestablished treatments but journals being more likely to accept for publication manuscripts with novel treatments . 274 Research funding bodies and commercial interests Research commissioning bias may contribute to publication bias since industry sponsors research and often own the data , making them susceptible to manipulation and suppression . Rosenberg noted the conflict between dissemination of research findings with the protection of investors who have supported the research that pervades modern science . 275 An editorial in JAMA noted that 35 % of signed agreements in a sample of university - industry research centres allowed the sponsor to delete information from publication , 53 % allowed publication to be delayed and 30 % allowed both . 276 The 2000 HTA report on publication bias included several studies that investigated association between study results and industry sponsorship in biomedical research . A study of clinical trials published in 1984 in five general medical journals showed 89 % of drug company - funded trials supported a new therapy compared with 61 % of generally funded trials ( p = 0 . 002 ) . 277 Another study of 56 RCTs published between 1987 and 1990 and concerning NSAIDs in the treatment of arthritis showed that in all trials manufacturer - associated drugs were reported to be comparable with ( 71 % ) or superior to ( 29 % ) the control drugs . 278 Of the 22 trials that reported a drug with less toxicity , the manufacturer - associated drug’s safety was reported to be superior in 86 % of cases with justification provided in only 55 % , suggesting selective publication or biased interpretation of results in manufacturer - associated trials . 278 Stelfox et al . examined the published safety profiles of calcium - channel antagonists and the financial association of authors with the pharmaceutical industry . 279 They identified 77 articles and a questionnaire was sent to 86 authors of 70 articles , of whom 69 authors completed the survey . Of the authors that supported the safety of calcium - channel antagonists , 96 % had financial relationships with the manufacturers compared to 60 % of neutral authors and 37 % of critical authors ( p < 0 . 001 ) . 279 Therefore , the DOI : 10 . 3310 / hta14080 Health Technology Assessment 2010 ; Vol . 14 : No . 8 © 2010 Queen’s Printer and Controller of HMSO . All rights reserved . 47 importance of full disclosure of relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers in journal articles was highlighted . 279 – 284 The updated review identified several recently published reviews or primary studies about industry sponsorship in biomedical research . 285 – 287 A systematic review published in 2003 by Bekelman et al . found that industry research funding was received by 23 % to 28 % of academic researchers , and was associated with restrictions on open collaboration , data access or publication of results . 285 Pooling of results from eight studies found that industry sponsorship was statistically significantly associated with pro - industry conclusions ( pooled OR 3 . 60 ; 95 % CI : 2 . 63 to 4 . 91 ) . 285 A similar systematic review by Lexchin et al . , also published in 2003 , found that ‘research funded by drug companies was less likely to be published than research funded by other sources’ , and industry - sponsored studies were more likely to report outcomes favouring the sponsor compared with studies supported by others ( pooled OR 4 . 05 ; 95 % CI : 2 . 98 to 5 . 51 ) . 286 Findings of the above two systematic reviews in 2003 285 , 286 are confirmed by results of recently published studies . 288 – 298 Jorgensen et al . compared Cochrane reviews with industry - supported meta - analyses of the same drugs . They found that industry - supported meta - analyses of drugs ‘were less transparent , had few reservations about methodological limitations of the included trials , and had more favourable conclusions than the corresponding Cochrane reviews’ . 299 Sawka and Thabane pointed out significant heterogeneity across studies in the meta - analysis by Bekelman et al . of results of industry - sponsored studies , and suggested that the pooled odds ratio is ‘unconventional’ . 300 In many studies included in the two systematic reviews , 285 , 286 industry - sponsored studies may not be comparable with non - industry - sponsored studies from many perspectives , 301 although they had similar methodological quality . Studies that included homogeneous research in terms of patients and interventions seemed less likely to find significant differences in results between industry - sponsored and non - industry - sponsored research . For example , in a meta - analysis of trials of antimuscarinic medications for overactive bladder , Tulikangas et al . found ‘no difference in outcomes when comparing studies funded by industry or not for tolterodine and oxybutynin’ . 302 Barden et al . investigated industry bias using comparable trials on acute pain and migraine and found no evidence indicating that industry - sponsored trials on acute pain and migraine were biased . 301 Therefore , publication bias ( including outcome reporting bias ) is only one of several possible explanations for observed association between favourable results and the industry sponsorship . However , direct evidence showing industry’s commercial interests as a source of publication bias does exist . 303 Identified case studies on biased reporting of research due to commercial interests are summarised in Appendix 16 . 136 , 214 , 215 , 217 , 220 , 276 , 304 – 332 Some pharmaceutical companies attempted to suppress the publication of ‘negative’ results by taking legal action , and all cases occurred before 2000 . 276 , 304 – 309 One company took legal action against an investigator in order to stop the publication of negative results from a study on deferiprone in patients with thalassaemia . 305 , 306 A study by Dong et al . showing bioequivalence of generic and brand name levothyroxine was suppressed by the pharmaceutical company due to the deleterious effect of the results on the price of the company’s product . 333 A pharmaceutical company also tried to suppress a systematic review that would have had a negative economic impact on statins . 334 Publication of a meta - analysis with unsupportive results of bovine somatotrophin was blocked by a pharmaceutical company using its legal rights over the raw data . 304 It seems that industry is no longer able to suppress the publication of results of entire sponsored research . However , the updated review identified several new cases in which results of industry - sponsored research were selectively reported or misrepresented in publication ( Appendix 16 ) . 136 , 217 , 219 , 220 , 222 , 323 , 324 , 331 , 332 , 335 Non - publication of ‘negative’ results was common . 317 – 320 , 322 , 336 For example , Psaty and Kronmal compared published and unpublished mortality findings in two trials of rofecoxib for Alzheimer’s disease . 219 The two published articles only mentioned on - treatment mortality in the text without any statistical analyses , and concluded that rofecoxib is well tolerated . 330 , 337 However , the company’s unpublished intention - to - treat analyses and the independent analyses based on data provided by the sponsor in the New Jersey Vioxx litigation found a statistically significant increase in total mortality ( HR 2 . 99 ; 95 % CI 1 . 55 to 5 . 56 ; and HR 2 . 13 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 55 to 5 . 77 , respectively ) . 219 Sources of publication bias 48 The direct evidence included in Appendix 16 was mainly restricted to some high - profile cases where investigators determined to challenge industry’s suppression of publication , or where the open access policy facilitated the identification of discrepancies between published and unpublished results . There may be many hidden cases where research results were not disclosed because investigators gave in to the pressure from research sponsors . A more recently published systematic review included seven studies that compared the reporting of adverse effects according to funding sources . 287 There was no clear evidence that the reporting of the raw adverse effects data was biased . However , a drug was more likely to be interpreted as safe by industry - funded authors compared with authors without pharmaceutical funding . 287 Variation in study results If the results from all possible studies were the same or similar , selected publication of results would not be biased . Greater variation in the results may be associated with an increased risk of publication bias . Factors that influence variation in study results include small sample size , small or moderate effect size , subjective nature of outcome measurement , and complex interventions . However , we have not been able to identify any studies that provide direct empirical evidence on results variation and publication bias .

Small sample size Studies with small sample sizes tend to produce variable results and present a range of results to select for publication . Simulations have demonstrated that small sample size is associated with considerable publication bias when only studies with significant results are published . 338 , 339 In practice , a small study with a non - significant result may be readily abandoned without trying to publish because it is easy and cheap to carry out in terms of time , staff and other resources invested . In addition , small trials may often be poorly designed and conducted . Therefore , the risk of publication bias will be great if many small trials have been conducted . 340 However , small trials may still be helpful in many aspects , and publication bias should not be considered ‘as a good reason to discourage trials with low power’ . 341 Figure 9 shows the results of a stochastic simulation investigating the relationship between publication bias and the range of possible sample sizes . Given a true odds ratio of 0 . 73 and other conditions assumed in the simulation , the estimated odds ratio is 0 . 23 when the sample sizes range from 20 to 100 , 0 . 44 when the sample sizes range from 20 to 500 , and 0 . 70 when the sample sizes range from 20 to 5000 . When the possible sample sizes range from 20 to 10 , 000 , the estimated odds ratio is 0 . 72 , nearly identical to the true value of 0 . 73 .

Sources of publication bias 50 significant results is reduced when there are many large - scale trials . Small effect size The simulation results also indicated that the extent of bias , by selecting the significant results to publish , is greater when the true effect is small or moderate than when the true effect is zero or large . 339 Figure 10 shows the results of a computer simulation about the relation between the true effect ( log odds ratio ) and the extent of bias . The difference between the true and the biased effect was large when the true effect is small compared with that when the treatment effect is zero or larger . Therefore , a small or moderate effect ( or weak association ) can be considered as a risk factor for publication bias . This risk factor may exist in most cases because clinical trials are mainly designed to assess health - care interventions with small or moderate ( but clinically important ) effects . Study design and other quality characteristics The design quality of studies may be associated with the risk of publication bias . Non - randomised studies , single - centre studies , and phase I and II trials might be more susceptible to publication bias than randomised studies , multicentre studies and phase III trials . 12 , 342 Risk factors for publication bias were assessed but not consistently identified across several cohort studies of publication bias . 20 – 22 , 24 Irwig and colleagues 343 suggested that publication bias is more of a problem for diagnostic tests than for randomised trials because ‘many studies of test accuracy may use data collected primarily as part of clinical care , there may be no clear record of attempted evaluations’ . It is therefore useful to estimate how easy it would be for investigators to abandon a completed study with unimportant results without publication , according to some study characteristics . Summary Investigators , peer - reviewers , editors and funding bodies may all be responsible for the existence of publication bias . The dissemination profile of a research finding is determined by the interests of research sponsors , investigators , peer - reviewers and editors . Evidence from newly identified studies confirmed findings from the previous HTA report that publication bias is often due to investigators’ failure to write up and submit . However , it should be recognised that the investigators’ decision to write up an article and then submit it may be affected by pressure from research sponsors , instruction from journal editors , and requirements of the research award system . Newly identified as well as previous included evidence indicates that the interests of research sponsors , particularly industry’s commercial interests , can restrict the dissemination of the research findings . Large differences in likely study results across similar studies that can be easily conducted and abandoned will further exacerbate the biased selection of findings for publication .

Although investigators , peer - reviewers , editors and funding bodies may all be responsible for the existence of publication bias , the importance of these responsibilities in terms of preventing publication bias may be different . As discussed in Chapter 6 , dissemination biases are related to many complicated factors , and these factors are inter - related . People’s tendency to notice only a portion of relevant research results has complicated social , cultural , political , economic and psychological bases . In spite of these difficulties , it is possible that biased publication of research and the impact of publication bias may be prevented to a certain extent and its impact minimised . In this chapter , we review measures that may help to reduce the existence and impact of publication bias , including changes to the publication of research , electronic publishing , an open access policy , the prospective registration of studies at inception and confirmatory large - scale studies . Changes in publication process Because of the huge number of published studies and specialist information needs , health - care practitioners , policy - makers and researchers must selectively receive information that is perceived relevant . At the same time , curiosity about new and atypical events by general readers means that to maintain a journal’s circulation , editors may have to accept studies for publication according to readers’ preference and type of information that readers required . Investigators might not write up and submit studies with negative results because of anticipated rejection according to journals’ instructions to authors and their own experience . The 2000 HTA report on publication bias listed some measures that could reduce publication bias by journals , including accepting manuscripts for publication mainly based on research protocols , 344 making prospective registration of trials a precondition for their publication , 345 disclosing conflict of interest or competing interests , 280 and electronically publishing and archiving research . 346 Early initiatives included that by The Lancet , a general medical journal , which in 1997 began to assess and register selected protocols of randomised trials and systematic reviews , and to provide a commitment to publish the main findings of the study . 347 In the same year , over 100 medical journals around the world invited readers to send in information on unpublished trials in a so called ‘trial amnesty’ . 348 Recently , biomedical journals have launched several initiatives and made important progress in the prevention of publication bias . The international guidelines for writing and editing publications 349 may help to prevent incomplete and biased reporting by the endorsement of sound reporting guidelines for specific study designs , including CONSORT ( Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials ) for randomised controlled trials , STARD ( Statement for Reporting Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy ) for studies of diagnostic accuracy , QUOROM ( Quality of Reporting of Meta - analyses ) for systematic reviews , and STROBE ( Standards for the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology ) for observational studies in epidemiology . 349 To help editors , peer - reviewers and authors to ensure transparent and complete reporting of health research , the EQUATOR ( Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research ) network has been developed . 350 – 352 Further empirical evidence is required to indicate the impact of reporting guidelines on reporting bias . Below , we discuss the prevention of publication bias by improved peer review , disclosure of competing interests , and electronic publication . The role of medical journals on the prospective registration of trials will be discussed later under ‘Prospective registration of trials’ . Peer review process Journal peer review has been defined as ‘the assessment by experts ( peers ) of material submitted for publication in scientific and technical periodicals’ . 257 The aim of peer review is to improve the general quality of published studies Chapter 7 Prevention of publication bias Prevention of publication bias 52 and screen out articles with flawed methodology or conclusions . 253 , 353 A large number of studies on the peer reviewing process are available but few are directly relevant to the prevention of publication bias . The previous HTA report on publication bias included some studies showing that the general quality of peer review had not been improved by blinding peer - reviewers to authors’ identities . 354 – 357 A recently published systematic review of studies on editorial peer review by Jefferson et al . 358 identified 19 comparative studies on editorial peer review . They included nine RCTs that investigated the effect of blinding on peer review . Of the nine RCTs , five found no effect of blinding on review quality and four found that blinding affected review quality although these studies highlighted the difficulty of ensuring robust blinding procedures . The effect of a submission checklist was investigated in two studies , with one showing no benefit and the other showing some benefit ( though this study had a small sample size ) . The limitations of this systematic review ( as noted by the authors ) included atypical settings , involvement of few major journals , small numbers of reviews and reviewers , and methodological weaknesses making validity of the studies reviewed difficult to assess . 358 Disclosure of commercial interest In order to reduce bias due to research funding many journals require authors to disclose their ‘conflict of interests’ or ‘competing interests’ . 349 The updated review identified several studies of disclosure of commercial interest of authors . Cooper et al . performed a study of the characteristics of conflict of interest policies of biomedical journals with regards to authors , peer - reviewers and editors using a survey . 359 The response rate for the survey was 67 % , with 93 % of journals reporting having an author conflict of interest policy and 11 % reporting that they restricted author submissions based on the conflict of interest policy . However , whilst 77 % of journals reported collecting conflict of interest information , only 57 % published author disclosures . Of interest , only 3 % of respondents published conflict of interest disclosures of peer - reviewers and 12 % published editor conflict of interest disclosures . 359 Conversely , a study by Cain et al . showed that disclosure may exacerbate bias rather than prevent it with the possibility of a conflict of interest statement subconsciously absolving the author of responsibility . 360 Whilst a conflict of interest statement may appear transparent in acknowledging bias , it is insufficient to prevent it . 361 Electronic publication The volume of electronic publishing has greatly increased due to its advantages of rapid publication , no limit in length of articles , no limit in numbers of studies , interconnected articles , cost - effective dissemination , and cost - effective archiving . 362 – 365 Because of reduced or no space limitations , electronic publishing may reduce publication and related biases by publishing research protocols and by allowing studies to be judged on their design and methodology rather than the immediate relevance of findings to current practice , novelty or exciting results . 366 Publication of research protocols prior to study completion has been recommended as a measure to prevent poor medical research . 346 The development of electronic publishing has provided great potential for the publication of research protocols . Any discrepancies between the research protocols and published studies will become transparent and outcome reporting bias may be prevented by the publication of protocols . 346 Electronic journals with no space limitations may encourage publication of studies with negative or no significant results as well as those that replicate previous studies . 366 Peer review in the context of electronic publishing is still important to ensure quality , but this could also be published in conjunction with the article . For example , online BioMed journals publish any accepted papers with their initially submitted versions and comments from peer - reviewers plus responses from authors to these comments . There are two forms of electronic publishing : printed journals with electronic supplementary materials , and electronic only journals . Sim and Rennels have suggested using the Trial Bank Model to publish traditional prose form studies and a concurrent electronic database of additional data . 367 This model has been adopted by the BMJ using the ‘electronic long – paper short’ ( ELPS ) mode of publishing . 368 Medical journals have two basic functions : medical recorder and medical newspaper . 369 The ELPS model , and the web - based supplementary material model , seem logical choices for these two different but related basic functions .

All rights reserved . 53 As a specific remedy for publication bias , the Journal of Negative Results in Biomedicine , an open access online journal , was introduced in 2002 with a remit to publish studies with negative results . 370 This journal is indexed by MEDLINE , EMBASE , Scopus and Google Scholar , making retrieval of the negative results it publishes more likely during systematic review . From inception to August 2008 it had published 60 articles . The recent development of electronic publishing has provided great opportunities for preventing publication and related biases , but we have found little direct evidence of how effective they are in practice . Electronic publishing itself won’t be able to resolve biased publication and reporting of research results . Many online open access journals [ including BioMed and Public Library of Science ( PLoS ) ] charge authors a fee to cover the publishing costs . It is still unclear what impact this pay - to - publish model has on publication and related biases and the general quality of studies published in these open access electronic journals . Prospective registration of trials In 1997 , over 100 medical journals around the world invited readers to send in information on unpublished trials in a so called ‘trial amnesty’ . 348 This was a request to retrospectively register conducted trials , even where outcome data were not provided , to enable other researchers , specifically systematic reviewers , to know of the existence of the study and write to the trialists for further details . One year after its launching , only 165 trials were registered 371 and it was considered a failure by 2004 . 372 This failure of retrospectively registering unpublished results led to further support for the development of prospective registration of studies . Accepting studies for publication based mainly on their pre - submitted research protocol could help to reduce publication bias by ensuring that the publication maintains its pre - stated primary outcomes , and is published regardless of whether that primary outcome shows a statistically significant effect . In 1997 , a general medical journal , The Lancet , began assessing and registering selected protocols of randomised trials and systematic reviews , and providing a commitment to send for peer review the main clinical findings of the study ( there is currently no commitment to publish a final paper ) 347 ( see also http : / / www . thelancet . com / journals / lancet / misc / protocol ) . Only 75 protocols had been accepted and registered in The Lancet by June 2007 , 373 and up to the time of writing ( August 2008 ) fewer than 100 protocols had been registered in this way ; other journals are yet to follow suit . Registration of study protocols by paper journals , although a good idea , is clearly not going to help to prevent publication bias in the bulk of research , and it is still feasible for a study to be registered with The Lancet , but not published by them if the results are not deemed appropriate for whatever reason . Prepublication of protocols has been recommended as an important measure to prevent poor medical research . 346 Electronic publication of systematic review protocols prior to study completion has become part of the online - only Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews , where all accepted reviews have their protocols peer reviewed and published before the completed review is published . This allows for feedback by any reader on the methodology or question addressed and prevents duplication of effort in defining research that is about to be undertaken . The development of electronic publishing has provided great potential for the publication of research protocols . Theoretically this ensures that any discrepancies between the research protocols and published studies become transparent and outcome reporting bias may be prevented . 346 Boissel et al . defined a clinical trial registry ‘as a database of planned , ongoing or completed clinical trials , published as well as unpublished , in which details concerning the trial’s objectives , main design features , sample size , and tested treatment are stored’ . 374 It has been generally accepted that prospective registration of trials at their inception may prevent publication bias . 103 Even if not all trials are registered , a prospective registration of some trials may provide an unbiased sample of all studies that have been conducted . 1 For example , the International Cancer Research Data Bank was used to assess alkylating agent therapy in advanced ovarian cancer . 127 The Clinical Trials Registry of the International Committee on Thrombosis and Haemostasis , established in 1974 , may be the first registry of clinical trials . 375 In 1988 , Easterbrook identified 24 registries of clinical trials . 376 Clinical trials included in these registries were prospectively or retrospectively identified by surveying selected individuals , organisations , pharmaceutical companies or other industries ; from conferences Prevention of publication bias 54 and selected journals ; searching other related registries of trials ; and by funding bodies or research ethic committees . 376 Currently , the two most important registries of clinical trials are the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number ( ISRCTN ) register and ClinicalTrials . gov . The ISRCTN ( available at http : / / www . Controlled - trials . com ) was launched in 2000 by the publisher Current Science Group and its ownership was transferred to a not - for - profit entity in 2005 . 377 ClinicalTrials . gov ( at www . ClinicalTrials . gov ) was developed in 2004 by the National Library of Medicine . As of August 2008 ISRCTN included over 7000 trial registrations , while ClinicalTrials . gov had registered almost 60 , 000 . Other important trial registries include the Australian Clinical Trials Registry , the Netherlands Trial Registry , and UMIN ( University Hospital Medical Information Network ) Clinical Trials Registry . 378 Voluntary registration of clinical trials is often incomplete and a mandatory system by government regulation may be necessary . 379 , 380 Spain’s Royal Decree of 1978 and a Ministerial Order of 1982 established a register of clinical trials . 381 The FDA Modernisation Act of 1997 in the USA also requests the establishment of a federally funded database containing information on both government - funded and privately funded trials of drugs designed to treat serious or life - threatening conditions . 382 The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has recognised the importance of trial registration and initiated a project in 2005 to set international standards for clinical trial registration . 383 The WHO Registry Network provides prospective trial registries with a forum to exchange information and work together to establish best practice for clinical trial registration . By establishing international standards , the WHO Trial Registry Portal will help to prevent selective dissemination of trial information by specific trial registers . The Clinical Trials Search Portal ( CTSP ) could be searched online by users to identify registered trials included in WHO’s trial registration database . 384 The most influential initiative is the introduction of a trials registration policy by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors ( ICMJE ) in 2004 . 10 Since 2005 , as a condition of consideration for publication in ICMJE member journals , trials must register at or before the onset of patient enrolment in a registry that is accessible to the public at no charge , open to all prospective registrations , and managed by a not - for - profit organisation . 10 A similar compulsory registration of clinical trials is also required by BMJ , with modified criteria for suitable registries . 372 The policy of compulsory trial registration required by journals has greatly increased the number of trials registered . 385 The number of trials registered in the ClinicalTrials . gov database increased by more than 70 % between May and October 2005 , after the implementation of ICMJE’s policy . 386 Even prospective registration of trials may not be sufficient to prevent all biases in the publication of trial results , including outcome reporting bias . The registration of all trial results ( published and unpublished ) has been advocated . 387 , 388 Although there is still disagreement about the registration of trial results , 378 publicly available full summary results from trials will help to reduce publication bias and outcome reporting bias . In addition , the prospective registration of research has currently focused mainly on phase III and phase IV trials . Biased selection for publication of early stage trials and non - trial studies ( such as basic research , observational studies and studies of diagnostic accuracy ) is still far from being resolved . For example , biased publication of early stage phase I studies may increase the failure rate of phase II studies . 389 Choi et al . suggested a global registry of anticipated public health studies . However , the establishment and maintenance of a comprehensive registration of non - trial studies will need to overcome more difficulties . 390 Trials registries will only be helpful in reducing publication bias if systematic reviewers include the registries in their search strategies and results of trials are accessible . Ramsey and Scoggins identified 2028 completed or terminated cancer trials from NIH’s ClinicalTrials . gov registry in September 2007 . 391 They then searched ClinicalTrials . gov and PubMed for peer - reviewed publications of these trials . It was found that only 19 . 5 % of the 1791 completed cancer trials and 3 . 4 % of the 237 terminated trials had been published in peer - reviewed journals . 391 Open access policy Since 1997 , the practice of incomplete release of information about licensed drugs in Europe for reasons of commercial interests and intellectual property has been challenged . 392 – 394 Abraham and Lewis 392 suggested that ‘the secrecy and confidentiality of EU medicines regulation is not DOI : 10 . 3310 / hta14080 Health Technology Assessment 2010 ; Vol . 14 : No . 8 © 2010 Queen’s Printer and Controller of HMSO . All rights reserved . 55 essential for a viable pharmaceutical industry’ , considering that European pharmaceutical companies often obtain data on competitors’ products by using the US Freedom of Information Act . There were already ‘encouraging signs’ in 1998 within the pharmaceutical industry to improve public access to the findings of clinical studies that the industry sponsored . 394 However , there were setbacks in transparent reporting of clinical trials sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry until several recent high - profile cases of incomplete reporting of industry sponsored trials . 380 Recently , policies of mandatory open access to the results of studies they sponsored have been adopted by many important research funding bodies , including the UK Medical Research Council ( MRC ) , the Wellcome Foundation , the European Research Council , the Canadian Institutes of Health Research , and the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) in the USA . 395 , 396 However , the current policies of open access focus on the openness of results of non - industry - sponsored studies , and it cannot prevent biased publication and reporting of results from industry - sponsored research . There is no convincing evidence indicating that online open access to published studies increases the number of their citations . 397 A study found that the possibility of an article being found on a non - publisher website was higher for articles published in journals with higher impact factors . 398 Therefore , self - archiving for open access is likely to be selective and may be biased . 399 Right to publication Some high - profile cases of publication bias reviewed in Chapter 6 were due to suppression by the industry of publication of negative results from industry - sponsored research . In 1997 , a pharmaceutical company changed its policy about dissemination of research it sponsored , allowing investigators ‘to publish studies conducted under generally accepted standards of scientific rigour without company prior approval’ , subject to the ‘right to review prepublication drafts to address intellectual property issues’ . 400 To prevent publication bias due to industry suppression , Rennie recommended that investigators ‘should never allow sponsors veto power’ , 276 and Rosenberg suggested that scientists should refuse ‘to keep information confidential and refuse to sign any agreements for the transfer of information or reagent that included a requirement of confidentiality . 275 A recently published study found that standards for clinical trial agreements with industry varied considerably among 107 academic medical centres , and subsequent disputes on intellectual property ( 30 % ) and control of or access to data ( 17 % ) were common . 401 Research sponsors’ guidelines Funders of clinical research often require investigators of sponsored studies to follow research guidelines . Influential research guidelines include International Conference on Harmonisation ( ICH Topic E6 ) , the EU Clinical Trial Directive , the Declaration of Helsinki , and the CONSORT Statement . 41 Dwan et al . surveyed research guidelines issued by 17 organisations and 56 charities that funded clinical trials . 41 They found that 11 of these organisations or charities emphasise the publication of both positive and negative results , and three request the adherence to trial protocols in data analysis and that any changes need to be explicitly reported . It was concluded that research funders’ guidelines should be improved to prevent selective reporting of outcomes . 41 Confirmatory large - scale trials For the purpose of avoiding moderate biases and moderate random errors in assessing or refuting moderate benefits , a large number of patients in randomised controlled trials are required . 402 Large - scale trials are generally believed to be less vulnerable to publication bias ; this is the fundamental assumption of many methods for detecting publication bias . When the existence of publication bias is likely and the consequences of such bias are clinically important , a confirmatory , multicentre , large - scale trial may be conducted to provide more convincing evidence . The updated review included no new studies for this section . Disagreements in results between large - scale trials and corresponding meta - analyses of small trials were observed in empirical studies . 403 – 405 Although small trials tend to lack statistical power and be more vulnerable to publication bias , the systematic review of small studies may provide useful information about whether a confirmatory large study is required and how to design such a study . 406 Prevention of publication bias 56 Large - scale confirmatory trials become necessary after a systematic review has reported a clinically significant finding but publication bias cannot be safely excluded as an alternative explanation . Confirmatory large trials are still important even when prospective registries of trials are available . This is because publication bias is only one of many potential threats to trial validity . Compared with a universal register of all trials , confirmatory large trials are more selective about the research areas and objectives , but more flexible at the same time to minimise the impact of other biases , for example , biases related to study design , selection of control , participants and setting . Summary The first step for the prevention of publication bias is a wide public awareness of detrimental consequences of publication bias , and the need for the results of all studies to be made accessible . Important actions by government , journals and research sponsors have been taken after several high - profile cases of incomplete disclosure of trial results by pharmaceutical companies were recently brought to light . Changes in editorial policy , the peer review process , disclosure of commercial interest , electronic publication , trial registration , and open access policy may all help to prevent publication and related biases , although there is as yet little direct evidence as to how well they work in practice . The recent development of electronic publication provides great technical potential to overcome some limitations of conventional printed journals . Publication and related biases may be reduced by electronic publication because of unlimited space , linkage between references , timely publication , and cost - effective dissemination and archiving . One important solution to publication bias may be the prospective registration of all studies at inception . Voluntary registration of clinical trials is usually incomplete . The policy of compulsory trial registration adopted by the International Committee of Medical Journals in 2004 may be the most influential initiative to promote prospective registration of clinical trials . Further mandatory government regulations may still be required . The development of prospective trial registration itself is not sufficient for the prevention of publication bias . It is important to make sure that results of registered trials are publically accessible . The usefulness of trial registrations relies on systematic reviewers searching them , using the data they provide and spending time contacting trialists where studies have not yet been published . Successful efforts so far have focused on biased reporting of phase III and phase IV trials , because of their immediate health consequences . Prospective registration of basic laboratory research , early stage clinical studies and observational studies is still underdeveloped . Open access policy is often mandatory only to public - or charity - supported research . Therefore , although publication bias might be reduced it could still be a problem in many fields of biomedical and health research .

Literature searching , locating unpublished trials and assessment of the risk of publication bias will be discussed first . Then methods designed to be used in meta - analysis are discussed , including funnel plot and related statistical methods , fail - safe N , and more sophisticated modelling methods . Finally , the importance of updating systematic reviews is discussed . Literature searching If time and resources were unlimited , it is possible that a literature search could identify all published studies relevant to a particular review question . In the real world , a balance must instead be struck between sensitivity ( the number of relevant studies identified as a proportion of the total number in existence ) and precision ( the number of relevant studies identified as a proportion of the total number retrieved ) . 2 These two parameters tend to be inversely correlated , such that effort expended on increasing sensitivity is costly in terms of retrieving non - eligible studies , which must subsequently be excluded on an individual basis . Bennett has developed methodology to assess the number of studies potentially missed in a systematic review . 407 Despite the need to work within a realistic framework , two main issues at this stage of a review can create significant bias in any subsequent analysis : limited exploitation of searching modalities , and low sensitivity within electronic search strategies . Limited exploitation of searching modalities Research literature exists in a number of different formats , such as peer - reviewed material published in academic journals , conference abstracts ( which may or may not be peer reviewed ) , other forms of grey literature and personal records . To carry out an effective systematic review , it is necessary to devise a literature search that can take account of this diversity . 204 Systematic reviewers have a range of searching modalities at their disposal ( e . g . electronic bibliographic databases , citation tracking , hand - searching of journals and bibliographies , contacting experts , etc . ) , but sometimes only one or two are exploited . In particular , search strategies sometimes concentrate almost exclusively on electronic bibliographic databases . This approach may lead to biased searching . For example , studies reporting non - significant results may be overlooked if they tend to be consigned to lower profile journals or other sources that are poorly indexed ( or not indexed at all ) . 408 – 410 Hand - searching initiatives are one of the few means of addressing the issue of poor indexing . 408 , 411 Such work may also tend to appear more often as grey literature or other unpublished material ( due to publication bias ) , in which case it may again be overlooked if the search is restricted to standard bibliographic databases . In addition , reliance on a standard protocol - driven strategy ( e . g . prespecified bibliographic database searches supplemented by limited hand - searching ) may be associated with the false impression that a search is necessarily exhaustive . Greenhalgh and Peacock recently showed that only 30 % of the studies eligible for their review could be obtained from a purely protocol - driven search , compared with the additional inclusions identified through ‘snow - balling’ ( reference and citation tracking ) and drawing on personal knowledge ( both within and beyond the research team ) . 412 Low sensitivity within electronic search strategies Some degree of bias is clearly possible when a search is based exclusively on bibliographic databases , but in some cases the effects may be too small to influence the results of a systematic review ; the power of contemporary search platforms to scan the vast numbers of records held in such databases also underlines the value of electronic searches . However , further bias may Chapter 8 Reducing or detecting publication and related biases in systematic reviews Prevention of publication bias 58 arise if searches are designed without adequate sensitivity . At a simple level , searches are sometimes only applied to a single database ( generally MEDLINE ) , or a limited set of databases , even though individual databases may only have partial coverage of the journals and other sources holding relevant studies . 413 Search results will then necessarily be constrained by the same criteria used to identify sources for inclusion on the databases themselves . The incorporation of excessively specific search terms ( e . g . methodological terms ) may also tend to reduce ( rather than increase ) sensitivity if the terms are used to limit ( rather than expand ) search results . Sensitivity may instead be maximised by favouring relatively generic terms , 414 , 415 albeit potentially at the cost of some reduction in precision . Similarly , the difficulties noted above in terms of the quality of database indexing 408 necessitate designing electronic strategies that combine text and index terms effectively . Language restrictions ( most commonly to English ) may also greatly reduce sensitivity where they are applied , depending on the amount of research published in the excluded languages . This may be a further source of bias where study outcome is linked to publication language ( particularly biased publication of non - significant results in non - English - language journals ) : although some evidence indicates the effects on meta - analyses may be small , comprehensive searching without language restriction remains an important safeguard . 153 , 416 , 417 In addressing a particular research question , it is important that systematic reviewers attempt to reduce the potential impact of dissemination bias on subsequent analyses . Accepting that there is a trade - off between search sensitivity and precision , 2 literature searches should therefore draw on as many different searching modalities as are necessary to identify relevant studies . In particular , searches may need to be extended beyond standard bibliographic databases to identify material from , for example , conference abstracts , other forms of grey literature ( such as reports by companies , governments or regulatory bodies ) , and personal or research group data ( which may only be disseminated locally ) . 204 , 409 Electronic search strategies should also be designed to ensure that the desired level of sensitivity is achieved ( thus reducing biases associated with particular databases , search terms , language restrictions and so on ) , for example by developing sensitive search filters . 418 However , it is clear that reviewers face particular obstacles in attempting to search comprehensively , in relation to both the grey literature , and ongoing / unpublished trials . Grey literature and non - English - language studies The ease with which conference abstracts can be identified is not always clear , because research organisations and societies may have different policies on publishing this material as official proceedings ( i . e . in society journals ) . 419 In many cases , conference proceedings are well indexed on databases such as MEDLINE , the Cochrane Library , and possibly SIGLE ( System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe ) , but it may be necessary to determine the best means of identifying abstracts in each individual case before a full search is performed . For example , reviewers could check with relevant societies and organisations to determine how conference abstracts are processed and design search strategies accordingly . Company and regulatory authority reports can be an additional source of useful unpublished data . For example , FDA reviews were used in one study to identify 10 unpublished FDA trial reports . 135 Although assessment of methodological quality was problematic due to poorer reporting , including this unpublished work did not appear to confound effect estimates by introducing ‘small study bias’ . 420 Even well - designed and non - language - restricted searches run on MEDLINE and EMBASE may miss a large number of non - English - language studies . One potential solution to this is to search the Cochrane Library . The Cochrane Collaboration has an extensive programme of hand - searching that covers a wide range of journals to ensure that controlled trials from a wide range of sources ( including non - English - language journals and conference abstracts ) are identified and correctly indexed . Additionally searching of language - specific databases ( such as LILACS – Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature ) may be appropriate , but relies on the reviewer having some knowledge of the relevant language ( s ) to ensure that the correct terms are entered . Locating ongoing or unpublished trials Ongoing trials can be defined as any trials that have started but where the results are not yet DOI : 10 . 3310 / hta14080 Health Technology Assessment 2010 ; Vol . 14 : No . 8 © 2010 Queen’s Printer and Controller of HMSO . All rights reserved . 59 available or only interim results are reported , although it is not always straightforward to distinguish between ongoing studies and unpublished completed studies . 421 Ongoing trials should be considered seriously in systematic reviews because of a possible time lag bias or ‘pipeline effect’ where the speed of publication depends on the direction and strength of the trial results . 113 Large - scale trials often follow early small trials , and results of early published small trials may be overturned by more convincing evidence from later large - scale trials . 403 – 405 In addition , ongoing trials may be designed particularly to answer important clinical or policy questions that have not been investigated in previous trials . 422 Awareness of ongoing trials will be helpful in making recommendations about when a systematic review needs to be updated and about the need for further research . 423 Trial registers and grey literature are important sources of information about ongoing trials . A study in 2003 that assessed six commonly used trial registers found that most registers provided sufficient information for reviewers to decide the relevance of identified ongoing trials . 421 However , it is sometimes difficult to know whether ongoing trials identified from different sources ( registers ) are the same trials or belong to the same multicentre trials , which may be resolved by the wide endorsement of the ISRCTN . Carefully tailored internet searches 424 , 425 and email surveys 426 , 427 may provide useful means of identifying such trials . However , direct communication with trial investigators can be difficult to establish and maintain . 428 – 430 More targeted approaches to investigators , based on hand - searching of conference abstracts and review articles , may help to ensure that reliable contacts are established . 431 Difficulties can also be encountered in relation to requests for unpublished material from completed but only partially published trials ; only 50 % of study authors responded to such requests in one study . 432 A survey in 1993 found that about 31 % of published meta - analyses included unpublished data . 116 The unpublished trials were often identified by surveying individuals , organisations or pharmaceutical companies . 228 , 229 , 433 – 437 The number of questionnaires needed to elicit information for each unpublished study ranged from one to five in surveys without restrictions on the study area . However , if the purpose was to obtain unpublished studies for a meta - analysis , the number of questionnaires needed for one unpublished study was 173 in the study by Shadish and colleagues’ . 436 In many meta - analyses , there might be no unpublished trials identified by surveying potential authors , research funding agents and industry . For example , in a systematic review of near patient testing , no unpublished data were obtained by sending questionnaires to 194 academics and 152 commercial companies . 438 The inclusion of unpublished data may not necessarily reduce the bias in meta - analysis , if the unpublished data are provided by interested sources such as pharmaceutical companies . 139 Unless one can decide whether the identified unpublished trials represent all unpublished trials and decide the proportion of identified unpublished trials in all unpublished trials , the potential publication bias cannot be convincingly solved by locating unpublished trials . Assessing the risk of publication bias Some study characteristics were found to be related to the risk of publication bias , such as observational studies , small sample size and small effect size ( see Chapter 5 ) . In addition , a comprehensive assessment of study quality is important to detect other potential biases , including selection bias , performance bias , attrition bias and detection bias . 439 A very important consideration is the conflict of interest of research and funding sources , particularly for deciding the possible direction of bias due to selective publication and reporting of results . The risk of bias may be great if all trials are funded by a single body with explicit or implicit reasons for favouring a particular finding . Conversely , when similar results are obtained from trials funded by sponsors with different competing interests , the risk of bias due to funding bodies may be less . In an article regarding false - positive findings from published studies , Ioannidis provided a list of circumstances where a finding is less likely to be true , 440 which may also be associated with a high risk of publication bias . Such situations include small sample size , small effect sizes , a large number of tested relationships , greater flexibility in designs or data analyses , great financial and other interests and prejudices , and hot scientific fields . 440 Prevention of publication bias 60 Funnel plot and related statistical methods Because of a larger random error , the results from smaller studies will be more widely spread around the average effect as compared with the results from larger studies . A plot of sample size versus treatment effect from individual studies in a meta - analysis should be shaped like a funnel if there is no publication bias or small - study effects . 441 To help the interpretation of funnel plot asymmetry , Peters et al . have recently proposed contour - enhanced funnel plots by adding contour lines indicating conventional milestones in levels of statistical significance ( e . g . for p < 0 . 01 , p < 0 . 05 ) . 442 A contour - enhanced funnel plot makes it possible to ascertain whether areas where studies are perceived to be missing are in areas of statistical significance and hence whether publication bias is the likely cause of the asymmetry . If the chance of publication is greater for trials with statistically significant results , the shape of the funnel plot may become skewed . In a funnel plot , the treatment effects from individual studies are often plotted against their standard errors ( or the inverse of the standard errors ) instead of the corresponding sample sizes ( Figure 11 ) . The use of standard errors has some advantages because the statistical significance is determined not only by the sample size but also by the level of variation in the outcome measured , or the number of events in the case of categorical data . 443 Light and Pillemer described two ways in which the shape of the funnel plot can be modified when studies with statistically significant results are more likely to be published . 441 Firstly , assume that the true treatment effect is zero . Then the results of small studies can be statistically significant only when they are far away from zero , either positive or negative . If studies with significant results are published and studies with results around zero are not published , the funnel plot may not be obviously skewed but there will be an empty area around zero ( see Figure 11 , 1 - B ) . These polarised results ( significant negative or positive results ) may cause many debates ; however , the overall estimate obtained by combining all studies is unlikely to be biased . Secondly , when the true treatment effect is small or moderate but not zero , small studies reporting a small effect size will not be statistically significant and therefore are less likely to be published , while small studies reporting a large effect size may be statistically significant and more likely to be published . Consequently , there will be a lack of small studies with small effect in the funnel plot , and the funnel plot will be skewed with a larger effect among smaller studies and a smaller effect among larger studies ( see Figure 11 , 2 - B ) . This will result in an overestimation of the treatment effect in a meta - analysis . The selection of a study for publication may be a function of many variables , such as sample size , level of statistical significance , extent or direction of difference between comparison groups , and design quality of a study . If the publication of a study is associated with the direction of the results , the extent of publication bias may be much greater than when publication is associated with only the level of statistical significance . Figure 11 , 1 - C and 1 - D are the funnel plots in which the selection is a function of statistical significance and sample size when the true treatment effect is zero . Figure 11 , 2 - A to 2 - D show the funnel plots of the results of computer simulation under different selection assumptions when there is a small treatment effect ( true odds ratio 0 . 8 ) . Limitations of funnel plot for detecting publication bias For a funnel plot to be useful there needs to be a range of studies with varying sizes . The funnel plot is an informal and subjective method for assessing potential small - study effect ; different people may interpret the same plot differently . The visual impression of a funnel plot may change depending on which measure of trial magnitude ( SE , variance , sample size , etc . ) or which outcome scale ( e . g . risk difference , relative risk , odds ratio ) is used . 444 It should be stressed that a skewed funnel plot may be caused by factors other than publication bias . Possible sources of asymmetry include different intensity of intervention , differences in underlying risk , poor methodological design of small studies , inadequate analysis , fraud , choice of effect measure , and chance . 149 Clinical heterogeneity as a source of funnel plot asymmetry can be illustrated using data adopted from the meta - analysis by Hofmeyr et al . of calcium supplementation in pregnancy for the prevention of pre - eclampsia . 445 The funnel plot ( Figure 12 ) is visually asymmetric , showing a tendency for large trials to be associated with a smaller treatment effect . However , it has been noted that the effect of calcium supplementation was greater for women with a high baseline risk of hypertension ( Figure 13 ) . 445 DOI : 10 . 3310 / hta14080 Health Technology Assessment 2010 ; Vol . 14 : No . 8 © 2010 Queen’s Printer and Controller of HMSO .

Therefore , the discrepancy in results between smaller and larger trials in this case may be partially explained by the different baseline risk of hypertension and other patient characteristics ( dietary calcium intake ) . 445 Terrin et al . asked 41 medical researchers visually to assess funnel plots of simulated meta - analyses ( each included 10 trials ) . 458 They found that 44 % of the funnel plots showed moderate to very high asymmetry when publication bias did not exist , whereas 34 % of the funnel plots showed no clear asymmetry even when publication bias did exist . That is , the shape of a funnel plot may be asymmetric purely by chance without selection bias , and a symmetrical funnel plot cannot exclude the existence of publication bias . It was concluded that ‘researchers who assess for publication bias using the funnel plot may be misled by its shape’ . 458 Statistical tests for funnel plot asymmetry It is often difficult for people to decide visually whether a funnel plot is asymmetrical or not . Therefore , some statistical methods have been developed to examine formally the skewness of a funnel plot . The 2000 HTA report on publication bias 2 included two methods for testing funnel plot asymmetry : the rank correlation test by Begg and Mazumdar ( 1994 ) 340 and a linear regression method by Egger et al . ( 1997 ) . 149 Since then , some new or modified tests have been proposed , all designed to test whether studies with smaller sample size or greater variation in results tend to report greater treatment effects in meta - analysis ( Table 2 ) . 8 , 9 , 149 , 340 , 444 , 459 – 462 Almost simultaneously , many recent studies have been conducted to compare the performance of these tests . 8 , 9 , 459 – 468 Different tests often lead to different conclusions in terms of the funnel plot asymmetry . All the proposed tests have some important limitations , including low statistical power to identify funnel plot asymmetry when it exists , and inflated rates of type I error when funnel plot asymmetry does not exist . The performance of tests for funnel plot asymmetry is particularly poor when heterogeneity in meta - analysis is large . 469 Ioannidis and Trikalinos ( 2007 ) 470 suggested that statistical tests for funnel plot asymmetry may be appropriate only if the following four criteria are met : • no significant heterogeneity • I 2 < 50 % • 10 or more studies ( with statistically significant results in at least one study ) • ratio of the maximal to minimal variance across studies > 4 . A survey of 846 independent meta - analyses from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews found that only 12 % of the meta - analyses met all the above four criteria . 470 The number of studies was fewer than 10 in 74 % of the meta - analyses and none of the studies was statistically significant in 34 % of the meta - analyses . About 30 % of the meta - analyses had statistically significant heterogeneity . 470 However , it should be noted that the above criteria were not based on convincing empirical evidence and further simulation studies may help to investigate how valid these criteria are . In the recently updated Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions , 469 Sterne et al . have provided some recommendations about the use of statistical tests for funnel plot asymmetry . The main points of their recommendations are summarised below . • The tests for funnel plot asymmetry should not be used in meta - analyses that include less than 10 studies . • To test funnel plot asymmetry , studies included in a meta - analysis should have different sizes , although it is not clear when the difference in study sizes are sufficient . • Egger’s test can be used for continuous outcomes measured by mean differences . • For dichotomous outcomes measured by odds ratio , tests proposed by Harbord et al . , 459 Peters et al . 9 or Rucker et al . 461 can be used in the absence of significant heterogeneity ( ι 2 < 0 . 1 ) . • Arcsine random - effect regression test 461 should be used when both treatment effect and heterogeneity are large ( e . g . ι 2 > 0 . 1 ) . • Funnel plot testing strategy should be specified in advance , and only one test should be used . Other tests for funnel plot asymmetry included in Table 2 are not recommended in the updated Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews 469 mainly because of low power 8 , 340 , 460 , 462 or lack of statistical evaluation . 444 There is very limited empirical evidence on the performance of the available tests for dichotomous outcomes measured as risk ratios or risk differences , and for continuous outcomes measured by standardised mean differences . 469 Prevention of publication bias 64 Trim and fill method The trim and fill method is a rank - based data augmentation technique , designed to estimate the number of missing studies and to provide an estimate of the treatment effect by adjusting for funnel plot asymmetry in a meta - analysis . 471 , 472 Briefly , the asymmetrical outlying part of the funnel is firstly ‘trimmed off ’ after estimating how many studies are in the asymmetrical part . Then the symmetrical remainder is used to estimate the ‘true’ centre of the funnel . Finally , the ‘true’ mean and its variance are estimated based on the ‘filled’ funnel plot in which the trimmed studies and their missing ‘counterparts’ symmetrical about the centre are replaced . 471 An early simulation study reported that the trim and fill method estimates the point estimate of the overall effect size approximately correctly and the coverage of the confidence interval is substantially improved , compared with ignoring publication bias . 471 However , further simulation studies found that the trim and fill method may perform poorly with high false - positive findings when heterogeneity in meta - analysis is large . 473 , 474 Because of the existence of clinical heterogeneity , as with all other funnel plot - based tests , the trim and fill method may provide a misleading estimate by spuriously adjusting for bias that actually does not exist . Other statistical and modelling methods Fail - safe N methods Several methods have been proposed to estimate the number of unpublished studies in a meta - analysis . 11 , 475 – 479 The first and most commonly used is Rosenthal’s fail - safe N , designed to estimate the number of unpublished studies required , with zero effect on average ( z = 0 ) , to overturn a significant result ( p < 0 . 05 ) in a meta - analysis . 11 If the number of unpublished studies with null results required to overturn the statistically significant result is large , and therefore unlikely to exist , the impact of publication bias is considered to be ignorable and thus the results obtained from published studies are held to be robust . The plausible number of unpublished studies may be hundreds in some areas or only a few in others . Therefore , the estimated fail - safe N should be considered in proportion to the number of published studies ( K ) . Rosenthal suggested that the fail - safe N may be considered as being unlikely if it is greater than a tolerance level of ‘5 K + 10’ . 11 There are problems with the fail - safe N method . 480 Firstly , the method overemphasises the importance of statistical significance . Secondly , it may be misleading when the unpublished studies have an average effect that is in the opposite direction to the observed meta - analysis . If the unpublished studies reported contrary results compared with those in the published studies , the number of unpublished studies required to overturn a significant result would be smaller than that estimated , assuming an average effect of zero in unpublished studies . In addition , the interpretation of estimated fail - safe N may be misleading because it is often difficult to decide the plausible number of unpublished studies . Becker has suggested that ‘the failsafe N should be abandoned in favour of other more informative analyses . ’ 481 Recently , a weight function method of sensitivity analysis proposed by Copas and Jackson 482 has been used to estimate a range of possible numbers of unpublished studies in a meta - analysis . This method is discussed below . Sophisticated modelling methods The impact of missing studies may also be assessed by using more sophisticated modelling methods . Many of the sophisticated modelling methods were discussed in depth in the 2000 HTA report 2 and in a review article by Sutton et al . 483 These methods are usually based on weighted distribution theory derived from both classical 338 , 484 – 492 or Bayesian 493 – 497 perspectives . There are two aspects to the selection models that use weighted distribution theory : an effect size model , which specifies what the distribution of the effect size estimate would be if there were no selection , and the selection model , which specifies how this effect size distribution is modified by the selection process . 498 In some methods the nature of the selection process is predefined by the researcher , while in others it is dictated by the available data . The appropriate application of modelling methods to test publication bias usually requires a large number of studies ( e . g . 100 or more ) in a meta - analysis . 499 However , the number of studies was fewer than 10 in most published meta - analyses . 470 In addition , it is difficult if not impossible empirically to verify the validity of assumed selection processes , since the true mechanisms and extent of biased publication or reporting are usually unknown . 482 Therefore , it has been DOI : 10 . 3310 / hta14080 Health Technology Assessment 2010 ; Vol . 14 : No . 8 © 2010 Queen’s Printer and Controller of HMSO . All rights reserved . 65 recognised that weight function models should be used to conduct sensitivity analyses , rather than to provide a single ‘correct’ estimate by adjusting for the assumed selection bias . 482 , 499 A sensitivity analysis method using weight function for assessing the impact of publication bias has been proposed by Copas et al . 482 , 489 , 500 The probability of study selection is assumed to be associated with estimated effect sizes and corresponding standard errors . Then a range of plausible values for inestimable parameters can be tested using the model to provide a range of corresponding estimates on the size of bias or the number of unpublished studies , which can be used to indicate the possible impact of selection bias under different assumptions . 482 Vevea and Woods recently proposed a new weight function model for the purpose of sensitivity analysis . 499 Similar to the sensitivity analysis approach proposed by Copas , 482 Vevea’s new model can be used to conduct sensitivity analyses using a range of assumed weight function parameters ( such as moderate or severe , one - or two - tailed selection ) , rather than to provide ‘a best guess’ at the true effect size . 499 Many proposed modelling methods require a large number of studies and therefore may not be appropriate for use in typical meta - analyses . Sensitivity analysis approaches proposed by Copas et al . 482 , 489 , 500 and by Vevea and Woods 499 could be used even when the number of studies is not large . Unfortunately , the complexity of these methods means that they have mostly been used only by statistical experts in method studies . Further development of user - friendly software is required to bring the methods into more mainstream use . Methods for detecting outcome reporting bias The existence of outcome reporting bias is suspected when some eligible studies could not be included in a meta - analysis due to a lack of data on an outcome . Outcome reporting bias is not a problem for studies that had not measured the outcome of interest . Therefore , it is crucial , although difficult , to investigate whether the outcome was measured or not in studies in which the outcome has not been reported . Published studies can compared with their protocols when available , or authors of published studies may be contacted to request clarifications about or data on the unreported outcomes . 439 Williamson and Gamble proposed a method to investigate the possible impact of outcome reporting bias by imputing data for unreported outcomes . 95 More recently , they compared their imputation method and the sensitivity analysis method proposed by Copas and Jackson 482 in the assessment of outcome reporting bias . 501 Results of simulation indicate that outcome reporting bias may be overadjusted by using the imputation method as compared to the Copas method . 501 Other statistical methods Bennett et al . proposed that a capture - recapture method may be used to assess the risk of publication bias . 407 The performance of the capture - recapture method has not been properly investigated by simulations . Ioannidis and Trikalinos proposed a test for an excess of significant findings . 502 The exploratory test can be used to estimate the number of the expected studies with statistically significant results according to certain assumptions . Then the number of expected significant studies is compared with the number of observed studies with statistically significant results . 502 Publication and related bias may be one of the reasons for the excess of significant studies . Fixed or random - effects models In meta - analysis , larger studies will give greater weight than smaller studies when results are quantitatively combined . 503 This procedure may have an advantage in reducing the impact of publication bias because less weight is given to smaller studies that are more vulnerable to publication bias . There are two statistical models that can be used to combine results of individual studies in a meta - analysis : the fixed - effects model or the random - effects model . 504 In the fixed - effect model it is assumed that all individual studies are measuring a single value of the true effect and that the observed difference between the studies is due to sampling error . The precision ( e . g . the inverse of within - study variance ) of individual results is employed as the weight for each study to estimate the pooled result in meta - analysis using the fixed - effect model . By contrast , the random - effects model assumes that individual studies are measuring a distribution of effects . In addition to the variation within studies , Prevention of publication bias 66 the variation between studies is also incorporated into a meta - analysis using the random - effects model . The differences between the fixed - effects model and the random - effects model are often ignorable when heterogeneity is small . 505 When there is large heterogeneity between individual studies , the confidence interval estimated by using the random - effects model will be wider than that by using the fixed - effect model . Jackson investigated the impact of publication bias on estimates of between - study variance ( ι 2 - statistic ) in meta - analysis . 506 The results of mathematical analysis demonstrate that publication bias may increase or decrease the between - study variance in meta - analysis . The weights used to combine individual studies are the inverse of within - study variances in the fixed - effect model , and are the inverse of total variance ( i . e . within - study variance plus between - study variance ) in the random - effects model . Therefore , by giving relatively larger weights to smaller studies , the random - effects model may be more vulnerable to publication bias than the fixed - effect model . 507 For this reason , it has been recommended that the result of the random - effects model should be compared with the result of the fixed - effect model when there is heterogeneity in meta - analysis . 469 If the pooled effect size by the random - effects model is greater than that by the fixed - effect model , underlying causes will need to be investigated , to exclude the possibility of publication bias . Updating systematic reviews Updating of systematic reviews may reduce the impact of publication bias because of the following reasons . First , publication of studies with negative or less favourable results may have a longer delay than studies with positive or favourable results . 113 Secondly , large - scale confirmatory trials are usually conducted and published after the publication of early small trials . Small trials may be more vulnerable to biased selection for publication , and the conclusions based on limited evidence from early small trials may be overturned by more convincing evidence from later large - scale trials . 403 – 405 Jadad et al . 508 compared 36 Cochrane reviews with 39 meta - analyses published in paper - based journals ( randomly selected sample ) published in 1995 . They found that , within 2 years after publication , 18 of the 36 Cochrane reviews had been updated versus only one of the 39 reviews published in paper - based journals . Possible reasons given for a very low update rate among paper - based reviews included editors of such journals not being sufficiently interested in publishing updated versions of previously published systematic reviews , authors not being aware of such interest , or authors lacking the interest or resources to update previously published reviews . 508 French et al . examined the effect of updating Cochrane systematic reviews from 1998 to 2002 . 509 They found that 137 ( 38 % ) of the 362 completed reviews published in 1998 were updated and had included new studies by 2002 . Among the 119 reviews that included new studies with comparable results , statistical significance of the primary outcome was changed from significant ( p < 0 . 05 ) to non - significant ( p > 0 . 05 ) in five and from non - significant to significant in six reviews . There was no mention of any changes in the direction of the estimates of treatment effects . French et al . concluded that ‘a priority - setting approach to the updating of Cochrane systematic reviews may be more appropriate than a time - based approach’ . 509 A recent study by Shojania et al . used 100 randomly selected systematic reviews of conventional therapy published from 1995 to 2005 to investigate important changes in evidence by updating . 510 They defined quantitative signals for updating as any ‘changes in statistical significance or relative changes in effect magnitude of at least 50 % ’ , and qualitative signals for updating as ‘new information about harm and caveats about the previously reported findings that would affect clinical decision making’ . Important changes in evidence were observed in 57 % of the reviews . Updating was required for important changes in evidence by 15 % of reviews within 1 year after publication , and by 23 % of reviews within 2 years after their publication . Multivariate analysis suggested that systematic reviews with cardiovascular topics and heterogeneity may need to be frequently updated . 510 Shojania et al . 510 also reported details about important changes in evidence for seven selected systematic reviews . Compared with findings from the original seven reviews , important changes in evidence suggested that treatments of interest were less beneficial in four cases , and more beneficial in another two cases , and less harmful in one . 510 This limited evidence indicates that estimated treatment DOI : 10 . 3310 / hta14080 Health Technology Assessment 2010 ; Vol . 14 : No . 8 © 2010 Queen’s Printer and Controller of HMSO .

( 1997 ) 149 The method is based on a regression analysis of Galbraith’s radial plot . 515 The standard normal deviate ( SND ) is defined as the ln OR divided by its standard error ( SE ) . The SND is then regressed against the estimate’s precision ( the inverse of the SE ) , weighted by the inverse of the variance . The intercept of the regression line provides a measure of funnel plot asymmetry The test is unbiased for continuous outcomes . For binary data , Egger’s test is biased due to the intrinsic association of the SND and its precision . 516 Egger’s test is more powerful than Begg’s rank correlation test , but has high false - positive rates , particularly when the treatment effect and / or the number of studies is large 464 Tang and Liu ( 2000 ) 444 A sample size - based linear regression in which the estimate of the effect size is regressed against the square root of the average number of participants in the two trial groups , weighted by the sample size Tang and Liu ( 2000 ) mentioned that the interpretation of the intercept alpha and its p value is the same as that of Egger’s method . The power and type I error of the method have not been properly investigated Macaskill et al . 2001 460 Linear regression of the estimated treatment effects ( dependent variable ) and corresponding sample size ( N t ) , weighted by the inverse of the variance of the logit of the pooled proportion ( using the marginal total ) The correlation between the weight and treatment effect is reduced . The statistical power of the test is low Deeks et al . ( 2005 ) 8 Linear regression of ln OR against 1 / ( ESS ) 1 / 2 , weighting by ESS , where effective sample size ESS = 4 ⋅ N 0 ⋅ N 1 / N t The test is developed for the evaluation of diagnostic odds ratio ( DOR ) . The power is likely to be low , particularly when heterogeneity across a study is large Harbord et al . ( 2006 ) 459 Modified Egger’s test : a regression of Z / √ V against √ V , where Z is the efficient score , and V the score variance With large heterogeneity ( e . g . ι 2 > 0 . 1 ) , the test has the problems of high false - positive rate and low power similar to Egger’s and Macaskill’s methods Peters et al . ( 2006 ) 9 Linear regression of estimated treatment effect against 1 / √ N t ; weight used as in Macaskill’s test The test is superior to Egger’s test in terms of more appropriate type I error rates . As with other statistical tests for funnel plot asymmetry , the statistical power is low when heterogeneity is large ( e . g . ι 2 > 0 . 1 ) Schwarzer et al . ( 2007 ) 462 Rank correlation test , based on observed and expected cell frequencies , and the variance of the observed cell frequencies , in 2 × 2 tables The test is developed for meta - analysis with sparse binary data . The power of the test is low Rucker et al . ( 2008 ) 461 The test is based on the arcsine transformation to stabilise the variance of binomial random variables . Then arcsine transformed statistics can be used to replace variables used in Begg’s test , Egger’s test , or a random - effects regression analysis Compared with other tests , arcsine transformed random - effects regression has improved power when both effect size and heterogeneity are large . The test is relatively conservative with small sample size and in the absence of heterogeneity effects may be reduced or increased by updating systematic reviews . Updating a meta - analysis involves repetitive statistical testing and the risk of type I errors will increase . 511 Under certain circumstances , type I errors due to repetitive tests for meta - analysis updating may be greater than publication bias . 512 To adjust for random error risk , Brok et al . recommended the use of trial sequential analysis ( TSA ) in meta - analysis . 511 However , possible type II errors and other biases are also important and the risk of type I error should not be a reason for not updating systematic reviews . Prevention of publication bias 68 Summary Many methods have been suggested for preventing , testing or adjusting for publication bias . The available methods could be classified as methods for preventing publication bias ( discussed in Chapter 6 ) and methods for dealing with publication bias in systematic reviews ( discussed in this chapter ) . In addition , it is possible to classify the available methods according to the stage of a literature review : to prevent publication bias before a literature review ( e . g . prospective registration of trials ) , to detect publication bias during a literature review ( e . g . locating unpublished studies , funnel plot and related tests , sensitivity analysis modelling ) , or to minimise the impact of publication bias after a literature review ( e . g . confirmatory large - scale trials , updating the systematic review ) . The recent development of clinical trial registration and electronic publication of results from clinical trials will facilitate the identification and location of ongoing or unpublished clinical trials . However , for non - trial studies , including basic laboratory research , epidemiological studies and even early stage clinical studies , publication and result reporting bias seems still at large as before . Funnel plot and related statistical tests have been widely used in systematic reviews to assess the possibility of publication bias . Unfortunately , the interpretation of results of funnel plot - related tests was often too simplistic and likely misleading . 513 , 514 Therefore , detailed recommendations have been recently proposed about when and how to use the funnel plot - related statistical tests in meta - analysis , 469 , 470 which may facilitate more cautious interpretation of funnel plot asymmetry . However , the current recommendations about tests for funnel plot asymmetry are based on very limited and fast changing empirical evidence , and they may have to be revised when new evidence emerges . Many sophisticated modelling methods have not been widely used in systematic reviews , possibly because of their complexity and lack of user - friendly software . The main development of sophisticated modelling methods perhaps is the more general recognition that these methods should be used to conduct sensitivity analyses , rather than to provide an estimate of the ‘true’ effect size by adjusting for assumed selection bias . However , it is unclear how useful such sensitivity analyses are when the results of meta - analyses are used for decision - making in practice . We concluded previously in the 2000 HTA report that all statistical methods ‘are by nature indirect and exploratory , and often based on certain strict assumptions that can be difficult to justify in the real world’ ; and ‘the attempt at identifying or adjusting for publication bias in a systematic review should be mainly used for the purpose of sensitivity analyses’ . 2 The updated review indicates that the above conclusions are still held .

However , the systematic reviews included in DARE were probably , on average , of higher quality than those from general bibliographic databases and hence the representativeness of the reviews assessed was questionable . In addition , reviews on effectiveness of health - care interventions and accuracy of diagnostic technologies were not assessed separately . The problem of dissemination bias might be different between the two types of systematic reviews . In the current updated review we have obtained a sample of systematic reviews from a general bibliographic database ( MEDLINE ) and classified these reviews into the following categories : ( 1 ) systematic reviews of studies on effects of health - care interventions , ( 2 ) systematic reviews of studies on accuracy of diagnostic tests , ( 3 ) systematic reviews of epidemiological studies on association between risk factors and health outcomes , and ( 4 ) systematic reviews of genetic studies on association between genes and disease . We also assessed a sample of systematic reviews that explicitly discussed publication bias . Assessment of randomly selected reviews We searched MEDLINE for systematic reviews published in 2006 ( see Chapter 2 for methods ) and randomly selected 100 systematic reviews of studies of effectiveness of interventions , 50 reviews of studies of diagnostic accuracy , 100 reviews of epidemiological studies on risk factors and health outcomes , and 50 reviews of studies of gene - disease associations ( Appendix 17 ) . The reviews were assessed independently by two reviewers using a data extraction form , tailored to the type of review being assessed ( Appendix 4 ) . Main characteristics of included reviews The 100 treatment effectiveness reviews comprised 54 reviews of pharmaceutical interventions , 10 reviews of psycho - educational interventions , 11 reviews of surgical interventions , and 25 reviews of mixed or other interventions . The median number of individual studies included in each review was 14 ( range 2 to 198 ) . The tests or techniques investigated in the 50 reviews of diagnostic accuracy included laboratory tests ( n = 21 ) , imaging techniques ( n = 28 ) , electrical tests ( n = 5 ) , clinical examinations ( n = 10 ) and other tests ( n = 7 ) ( several reviews assessed more than one test or technique ) . The median number of studies included in the 50 reviews was 20 ( range 4 to 213 ) . Risk factors investigated in 100 reviews of epidemiological studies included lifestyle ( n = 31 ) , environmental ( n = 17 ) , biomedical ( n = 45 ) , mental ( n = 6 ) and other factors ( n = 18 ) . Cancer ( n = 24 ) and cardiovascular diseases ( n = 20 ) were common health outcomes considered in these reviews . The median number of studies included in each review was 20 ( range 3 to 200 ) . In 50 reviews of gene - disease association , diseases investigated included cancer ( n = 13 ) , cardiovascular disease ( n = 4 ) , diabetes ( n = 3 ) and mental diseases ( n = 15 ) . The median number of studies per review was 13 ( range 3 to 86 ) . Among the 300 systematic reviews 83 were narrative systematic reviews in which the results of the primary studies were summarised but not statistically combined , and 217 were meta - analyses , in which statistical methods were used to combine the results of two or more primary studies ( Table 3 ) . There were 16 ( 16 % ) Cochrane reviews amongst the 100 treatment reviews . Systematic literature search Similar to the findings reported in the 2000 HTA report , MEDLINE ( 74 % to 95 % ) and checking Survey of published systematic reviews 70 TABLe 3 Types of reviews – narrative or meta - analyses Narratives ( % ) Meta - analyses ( % ) Total ( % ) Treatment 40 ( 40 % ) 60 ( 60 % ) 100 Diagnostic 9 ( 18 % ) 41 ( 82 % ) 50 Risk factor 32 ( 32 % ) 68 ( 68 % ) 100 Genetic 2 ( 4 % ) 48 ( 96 % ) 50 Total 83 ( 28 % ) 217 ( 72 % ) 300 TABLe 4 Searching of prospective registers of trials or other studies in reviews Study register Treatment review Diagnostic review Risk - factor review Genetic review Physician Data Query clinical trial register 2 UK National Research Register 8 3 2 ClinicalTrials . gov 8 1 Current Controlled Trials 3 1 1 Other / unclear 5 Number of reviews searched study registers 18 / 100 3 / 50 2 / 100 0 / 50 reference lists of retrieved studies ( 42 % to 73 % ) were most commonly used to search literature ( Figure 14 ) . EMBASE was now searched in about half of the treatment and diagnostic reviews ( 50 % and 54 % , respectively ) , compared with only 17 % in the previous reviews . There was a considerable increase in the utilisation of the Cochrane Library , from only 5 % in reviews published in 1996 to 58 % in treatment reviews , 46 % in diagnostic reviews , 24 % in risk - factor reviews and 6 % in genetic reviews . The search of the CINAHL ( Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature ) database increased from 8 % in 1996 to 24 % in treatment reviews , 20 % in diagnostic reviews , and 18 % in risk factor reviews in 2006 . Prospective registers of clinical trials and other studies were searched for unpublished or ongoing studies in 18 treatment reviews , three diagnostic reviews and two risk - factor reviews ( Table 4 ) . The UK National Research Register and ClinicalTrials . gov are the two commonly searched prospective registers . Language restriction The current review examined whether language restrictions ( e . g . included studies were limited to English - language ones only ) were applied by the review authors . It was found that 35 % of the reviews showed language restriction , with the majority of them being restricted to English language . Thirty - five percent of the reviews did not explicitly report whether any language restrictions were applied or not . The proportion of reviews that explicitly stated no language restriction was 39 % in treatment reviews , 42 % in diagnostic reviews , and 20 % in risk - factor reviews and genetic reviews ( Table 5 ) . Non - English - language studies were explicitly searched for in 45 % treatment reviews , 52 % diagnostic reviews , 34 % risk - factor reviews and 22 % genetic reviews . Overall , 39 % of the reviews explicitly searched for non - English - language studies , compared with 19 % in the reviews published in 1996 . However , only 15 % of the reviews actually included non - English - language studies ( Table 5 ) . Authors did not always explicitly mention that they had searched for non - English - language studies , even though non - English studies were indeed listed in the review . Treatment reviews and diagnostic reviews were more likely to have no language restrictions , and more frequently searched for or included non - English - language literature compared with DOI : 10 . 3310 / hta14080 Health Technology Assessment 2010 ; Vol . 14 : No . 8 © 2010 Queen’s Printer and Controller of HMSO .

Checking the reference list of the reviews indicates that conference abstracts were frequently included . Grey literature was explicitly sought in 50 % of treatment reviews , 30 % of diagnostic reviews , 32 % of risk - factor reviews , and only 8 % of genetic reviews ( Table 6 ) . Overall , 34 % of the 300 reviews explicitly searched for grey literature , although only 13 % included them . To identify other unpublished studies , the commonly used method was through contacting authors or experts , and pharmaceutical companies . Of the 300 reviews , 27 % explicitly searched for other unpublished studies and only 8 % actually included them ( Table 6 ) . When grey literature and other unpublished studies were combined , the proportion of reviews that explicitly searched for grey or unpublished studies was 58 % for treatment reviews , 36 % for diagnostic reviews , 35 % for risk - factor reviews and 10 % for genetic reviews ( Table 6 ) . In addition , Table 6 also shows that grey literature and unpublished studies were more likely to be included in treatment reviews than diagnostic or risk - factor reviews . The previous HTA report showed that only about 35 % of reviews explicitly searched for or included studies that were unpublished or presented as abstracts . 2 In reviews published in 2006 , this was 61 % for treatment reviews , 36 % for diagnostic reviews , 41 % for risk - factor reviews and 20 % for genetic reviews ( Table 6 ) .

All rights reserved . 73 Consideration of outcome reporting bias Outcome reporting bias is related to the incomplete reporting within published studies and occurs when studies with multiple outcomes selectively report only some of the measured outcomes . We examined whether outcome reporting bias was considered and / or reported in our sample of 300 reviews . We found that outcome reporting bias was explicitly mentioned in 18 % of treatment reviews , 14 % of diagnostic reviews , 3 % of risk - factor reviews and 16 % of genetic reviews . Methods used to test for publication bias Available tests for publication bias were not used in the majority of treatment reviews ( 79 % ) , diagnostic reviews ( 76 % ) and risk - factor reviews ( 69 % ) ( Table 7 ) . Compared with other reviews , publication bias was more likely to be tested in genetic reviews , possibly due to perceived high risk of bias in such reviews . The most commonly used methods for testing the association between sample sizes and treatment effects were funnel plots complemented by other related methods ( Egger’s and Begg’s test ) . Egger’s test was explicitly used in 45 reviews and Begg’s test in 24 reviews . Funnel plot and other related methods were used in 26 % of the 300 reviews , compared with less than 6 % in the 193 reviews published in 1996 . In contrast to reviews published in 1996 , the fail - safe N method was used in far fewer reviews ( 7 % versus 1 % ) . All other statistical methods to test publication bias were only rarely used . In the reviews that explicitly tested for publication bias , 23 % of the 21 treatment reviews , 42 % of the 12 diagnostic reviews , 52 % in the 31 risk - factor reviews , and 48 % in the 27 genetic reviews showed some evidence of the existence or absence of publication bias . Consideration of publication bias In accordance with the findings of the previous report , 2 publication bias was discussed or mentioned more often in the meta - analyses than in the narrative reviews ( Table 8 ) . The possibility of potential publication bias was discussed more often in the genetic reviews ( 70 % ) than in treatment reviews ( 32 % ) , diagnostic reviews ( 48 % ) and risk - factor reviews ( 42 % ) ( Table 8 ) . When conclusions of authors of reviews were classified as positive , not positive and unclear , we found positive conclusions in 61 % of treatment reviews , 35 % of diagnostic reviews , 91 % of risk - factor reviews and 32 % of genetic reviews . Because of the small number of available reviews , it is not clear whether authors’ conclusions were associated with whether or not publication bias was explicitly tested or considered in a review ( Table 8 ) . Similarly , there was no clear trend to show that publication bias was more or less likely to be explicitly tested or discussed in meta - analyses that reported statistically significant results ( Table 8 ) . Assessors’ judgement Efforts taken to minimise publication bias As part of our study , we used two assessors to assess independently the efforts taken by review authors to minimise publication bias within the selected sample of reviews . The assessors’ judgements were based on the following measures : literature searching approach used , consideration of outcome reporting bias , reporting of any missing outcomes and methods used to deal with the missing outcomes , and discussion of publication bias and any methods used to deal with publication bias . For each review , two assessors independently scored TABLe 7 Methods used to deal with publication bias in reviews Treatment Diagnostic Risk factor Genetic Not used 79 ( 79 % ) 38 ( 76 % ) 69 ( 69 % ) 23 ( 46 % ) Funnel plot and related methods 15 ( 15 % ) 9 ( 18 % ) 27 ( 27 % ) 26 ( 52 % ) Egger’s test 9 ( 9 % ) 2 ( 4 % ) 16 ( 16 % ) 18 ( 36 % ) Begg’s test 5 ( 5 % ) 0 8 ( 8 % ) 11 ( 22 % ) Trim - fill method 0 0 2 ( 2 % ) 0 Fail - safe N 2 ( 2 % ) 0 1 ( 1 % ) 0 Modelling 0 0 0 1 ( 2 % ) Other 2 ( 2 % ) 1 ( 2 % ) 5 ( 5 % ) 5 ( 10 % ) Survey of published systematic reviews 74 T A B L e 8 C o n s i d e r a t i o n o f p ub li c a t i o n b i a s and r e s u l t s o r c o n c l u s i o n s o f r e v i e w s T r e a t m e n t r e v i e w s D i a g n o s t i c r e v i e w s R i s k f a c t o r r e v i e w s G e n e t i c r e v i e w s T o t a l T e s t e d % D i s c u ss e d % T o t a l T e s t e d % D i s c u ss e d % T o t a l T e s t e d % D i s c u ss e d % T o t a l T e s t e d % D i s c u ss e d % A u t h o r s ’ c o n c l u s i o n s P o s i t i v e 61 26 . 2 % 32 . 8 % 35 28 . 6 % 48 . 6 % 91 34 . 1 % 45 . 1 % 32 56 . 3 % 71 . 9 % N o t p o s i t i v e 12 25 . 0 % 33 . 3 % 9 1 / 9 4 / 9 5 0 / 5 1 / 5 17 47 . 1 % 64 . 7 % U n c e r t a i n 27 7 . 4 % 29 . 6 % 6 1 / 6 3 / 6 4 0 / 4 0 / 4 1 1 / 1 1 / 1 M e t a - ana l y s i s r e s u l t s N o t c o n d u c t e d 40 2 . 5 % 15 . 0 % 32 6 . 3 % 21 . 9 % 2 0 / 2 1 / 2 S i g n i fi c a n t 49 36 . 7 % 44 . 9 % 66 43 . 9 % 53 . 0 % 33 57 . 6 % 72 . 7 % N o n - s i g n i fi c a n t 11 18 . 2 % 36 . 4 % 2 0 / 2 0 / 2 15 53 . 3 % 66 . 7 % T o t a l 100 21 . 0 % 32 . 0 % 50 24 . 0 % 48 . 0 % 100 31 . 0 % 42 . 0 % 50 54 . 0 % 70 . 0 % A c t u a l nu m b e r s a r e g i v e n w h e n d e n o m i n a t o r s a r e < 1 0 .

Efforts taken to minimise bias were ‘sufficient’ if the review attempted to search and probably include non - English - language studies , grey literature and unpublished studies , considered outcome reporting bias , the issue of publication bias and reported any missing outcome data . ‘Partial’ efforts to minimise bias were when the review searched at least two of the three , i . e . non - English - language studies and / or grey literature and / or unpublished studies , may or may not have considered outcome reporting bias and publication bias , and may or may not have reported missing outcome data . Efforts taken to minimise bias were ‘insufficient’ when no attempts were made by the review authors to search for non - English - language studies , grey literature or unpublished studies , they did not consider outcome reporting bias or publication bias , and did not report missing outcome data . These judgements were then converted to scores as follows : insufficient = 0 ; partial = 1 and sufficient = 2 , and pooled together for each assessor . Table 9 shows the results of assessors’ judgement about whether the review authors’ efforts to minimise publication bias were sufficient or not . There was a fair agreement between assessors for the treatment reviews ( κ = 0 . 30 ) and risk factor reviews ( κ = 0 . 35 ) . Moderate agreement was seen for genetic ( κ = 0 . 43 ) and diagnostic reviews ( κ = 0 . 40 ) . The rate of agreement between assessors was 55 % for treatment reviews , 68 % for diagnostic and risk factor reviews , and 74 % for genetic reviews . Based on the agreed judgement by two independent assessors , efforts to minimise publication bias were less likely to be insufficient in treatment reviews ( 18 % ) compared with diagnostic reviews ( 30 % ) , risk factor reviews ( 55 % ) and genetic reviews ( 56 % ) ( Table 9 ) . Risk of publication bias Two assessors also independently assessed the possibility that review authors’ conclusions might be invalid because of possible publication and related biases . The judgement for assessing the potential risk of publication bias was based on the efforts taken to minimise publication bias , discussion of publication bias , methods used to deal with publication bias and finally the authors’ conclusion . The assessment was subjective without proper validation of the criteria . Two assessors independently scored the perceived risk of publication bias in systematic reviews . Risk of bias was marked as ‘high’ if the efforts taken to minimise publication bias were partial or insufficient , publication bias was not discussed and the authors’ conclusions were positive . Risk of bias was ‘moderate’ if partial efforts were taken to minimise bias , publication bias was probably considered , and the author’s conclusions might have been positive with cautious interpretation . Risk of bias was ‘low’ if partial or sufficient efforts were taken to minimise bias , publication bias was considered with some methods used to deal with it , and the author’s conclusions were negative . These judgements were converted to the following scores : low = 0 , moderate = 1 and high = 2 . Table 10 shows the results of assessors’ assessment of the risk of publication bias in reviews . Agreement between assessors was poor for treatment reviews ( κ = 0 . 17 ) , fair for genetic and diagnostic reviews ( κ = 0 . 29 and κ = 0 . 25 respectively ) , and moderate for risk factor reviews ( κ = 0 . 44 ) . The rate of agreement between the two assessors was 53 % for treatment reviews , 68 % for diagnostic reviews , 73 % for risk factor reviews and 60 % for genetic reviews . According to the agreed judgement by two independent assessors , the rate of moderate to high risk of publication bias was relatively lower in treatment reviews ( 48 % ) in comparison with diagnostic reviews ( 64 % ) , risk factors reviews ( 71 % ) and genetic reviews ( 58 % ) . Assessment of reviews that explicitly tested for publication bias A random sample was obtained of 50 reviews , published from 2000 to 2008 in MEDLINE , that explicitly tested for or considered publication bias . Data extraction of these 50 reviews was independently conducted by two reviewers and any disagreements were resolved by discussion between the two reviewers or by a third reviewer . Three reviews were further excluded as the full publication could not be obtained ; hence a total of 47 reviews were analysed . Of the 47 reviews included , 18 ( 38 % ) evaluated effects of treatment intervention , 16 ( 34 % ) studied the association between various risk factors and disease , seven ( 15 % ) studied the association between a specific gene and disease , three ( 6 % ) evaluated the accuracy of diagnostic tests , and the remaining three ( 6 % ) had other objectives .

Non - English - language studies were explicitly searched for in 38 % of reviews including four narrative reviews and 14 meta - analyses . None of the four narrative reviews included non - English - language studies . The remaining reviews ( 40 % ) were unclear regarding the search for or inclusion of non - English - language studies . Grey literature was searched for in 14 % of the reviews and 13 % included them . A majority of the reviews ( 85 % ) did not clearly mention searching for or including grey literature . The analysis showed that 72 % of the reviews did not mention searching for or including unpublished studies . Only nine ( 19 % ) exclusively searched for unpublished studies and only two ( 4 % ) included them . The assessment of the sources searched in these reviews is consistent with the findings of the 300 reviews assessed in the first part of this chapter . MEDLINE ( 96 % ) was the most commonly searched database . Other sources used to identify literature were checking of reference lists of identified studies ( 81 % ) , EMBASE ( 64 % ) , specialised and other databases ( 53 % ) , Cochrane Library ( 47 % ) , contacting authors or experts ( 30 % ) , hand searching journals ( 17 % ) , CINAHL ( 17 % ) , PsycINFO ( 15 % ) , conference proceedings ( 13 % ) , SIGLE ( 6 % ) , and contacting pharmaceutical companies ( 6 % ) .

Outcome reporting bias was not considered in 87 % of the reviews , and only 11 % of the reviews reported missing outcome data . The analysis of reviews for discussion of publication bias and the methods used to test publication bias showed that publication bias was discussed in 44 ( 94 % ) of the reviews , and that funnel plot was the most commonly used method to detect publication bias ( 75 % ) . This method was then followed by Egger’s test ( 49 % ) and Begg’s test ( 32 % ) . Methods like identifying unpublished trials , the fail - safe N method and trim and fill method were only rarely used ( 2 % each ) . Of the 44 reviews in which authors explicitly considered risk of publication bias , 19 ( 43 % ) reviews had a high risk of bias , eight ( 18 % ) had a moderate risk of bias and 17 ( 39 % ) had a low risk of bias . We further assessed the association of discussion of publication bias with the review authors’ conclusions and found that 39 reviews that discussed publication bias had significant results with considerable uncertainty . Another four reviews that discussed publication bias had non - significant results and only one review had significant results . This indicates that in most of the reviews the authors have interpreted the results with caution when there is any consideration or existence of publication bias . Survey of published systematic reviews 78 Two assessors independently assessed the efforts taken to minimise publication bias within the selected sample , and the risk of publication bias . In assessing whether the efforts taken to minimise publication bias were sufficient , partial or insufficient , there was a fair agreement between assessors ( κ = 0 . 32 ) . The judgement for assessing the potential risk of publication bias was based on the efforts taken to minimise publication bias , discussion of publication bias , methods used to deal with publication bias and finally the authors’ conclusion . The 47 reviews showed a poor agreement between assessors for the risk of publication bias ( κ = 0 . 09 ) . Summary A survey of systematic reviews of studies of treatment efficacy and diagnostic accuracy published in 1996 concluded that the issue of publication bias was largely being ignored in systematic reviews , and very few of them actually used any methods to deal with publication bias . However , in the current survey of reviews published in 2006 , there was some improvement in the methods used to deal with publication bias . Reviews of health - care interventions ( therapeutic or diagnostic ) are making greater efforts to locate and / or include non - English - language studies ( 47 % versus 30 % ) , and grey literature or unpublished studies ( 53 % versus 35 % ) . A thorough literature search while conducting a systematic review may reduce the possibility of excluding unpublished studies , those published in non - English languages or as grey literature . It is always advisable to search more than one electronic database as many journals are indexed in only one of the commonly used databases . 517 Compared with the previous sample of reviews , there was an increase in the use of available methods to test for publication bias in recent reviews ( 22 % versus 17 % ) . However , the proportion of reviews in which publication bias was explicitly discussed remained the same between recent treatment and diagnostic reviews and the previous sample ( 37 % versus 36 % ) . The previous assessment recognised that the problems of publication and related biases were more often dealt with in meta - analysis than in narrative reviews . This finding is unchanged in the updated review and which could merely be a reflection of marked heterogeneity within the sample . Assessment of the narrative reviews showed an overall lack of efforts taken to reduce or minimise publication bias in all four categories of reviews . Funnel plot and related statistical tests ( including Egger’s test and Begg’s test ) are common methods used to detect publication bias in systematic reviews , particularly in risk factor reviews . The fail - safe N method was used in some previous reviews but it was much less likely to be used in recent reviews ( 7 % versus 1 % ) . All other methods are not , or very rarely , used in the 300 general reviews and in the 44 reviews in which publication bias was explicitly tested . Non - English - language studies and grey literature or unpublished studies were more likely to be explicitly searched for in treatment and diagnostic reviews , compared with reviews of epidemiological studies ( 50 % versus 35 % , and 53 % versus 34 % , respectively ) . Conversely , publication bias was less likely to be tested and discussed in treatment and diagnostic reviews than in epidemiological reviews ( 22 % versus 39 % , and 37 % versus 51 % , respectively ) . These differences between reviews of intervention studies and reviews of observational studies are possibly due to different approaches taken by authors in different fields to deal with perceived problems of publication bias . In a recent study that examined the frequency and determinants of full publication of studies of diagnostic accuracy submitted as abstracts at international stroke meetings , it was found that 76 % of 160 abstracts were subsequently published in full and that clinical utility of results or other study characteristics did not predict their publication . However , this study was unable to assess the extent of a possible bias in the selection of abstracts for presentation . 57 When assessors were asked to assess independently the level of efforts taken to minimise publication bias and the risk of publication bias in reviews , the rate of agreement was on an average 64 % and 63 % respectively . Based on the agreed judgement , reviews of treatment effect were more likely to have insufficient efforts to minimise publication bias , but less likely to have moderate or high risk of publication bias , compared with reviews of diagnostic accuracy or risk factors ( including gene - disease association ) . According to data from 44 reviews in which risk of publication bias was explicitly considered by authors , 43 % of reviews had a high risk , 18 % had a moderate risk and 39 % had a low risk of publication bias .

Most of the variables in the data extraction form were assessed subjectively as ‘yes’ , ‘no’ or ‘unclear’ and hence information may have been lost . For example , many studies reported that non - English - language studies were included , but to what extent they were searched for was unclear . The extent of searching for studies in languages other than English may vary , from having no language restriction in a PubMed search to running searches in specific non - English language databases . The same applies for grey literature and unpublished studies . The risk of publication bias was assessed from several perspectives : completeness of literature search , findings of any efforts to detect publication bias , and results of meta - analysis . This assessment was qualitative and the criteria have not been properly validated . However , we reported the results of the assessment of risk of bias to illustrate difficulties in any such attempts .

It appears that publication bias occurs mainly before the presentation of findings at conferences and the submission of manuscripts to journals . However , factors associated with publication bias remain unclear . The existence of outcome reporting bias has been demonstrated by recently published empirical studies . There is limited evidence indicating that harm outcomes and subjectively assessed outcomes may be more vulnerable to reporting bias than efficacy outcomes and objectively assessed outcomes . Studies with significant or important results were , on average , published earlier than studies with non - significant results , although the new evidence was less clear than was suggested in the previous report . Any time lag bias is likely to occur before manuscript submission for journal publication . 81 Substantial new evidence on grey literature and language bias was identified in this updated review . Grey literature or non - English - language studies on average reported smaller treatment effects than studies that were formally published or studies that were published in English . However , the direction and extent of bias was usually unpredictable . There is limited evidence indicating that the risk of language bias may be particularly high in some areas of research such as complementary and alternative medicine . The updated review also identified limited new evidence on citation bias , duplicate publication bias , place of publication bias , database bias and media attention bias . As a direct consequence of publication and related biases , estimates based on published studies may be misleading . For example , publication and related bias may result in an overestimation of treatment effects or an underestimation of adverse effects . In this updated review , the consequences of publication and related biases were separately discussed for basic ( animal and laboratory ) research , observational studies and clinical trials . Biased publication of results of basic research may explain negative results from subsequent clinical trials . Contradictory findings from epidemiological studies may be partly due to publication and related biases . The consequences of publication bias in clinical trials may be more serious , resulting in the use of less cost - effective , or ineffective , or even harmful interventions in clinical practice . This updated review identified a few new cases that indicated the detrimental impact of publication and related biases . This updated review confirmed findings from the previous HTA report that the most common reason for publication bias was that investigators failed to write up or submit studies with non - significant results ( see Figure 7 ) . However , it should be recognised that investigators’ decision to write up an article and then submit it may be affected by pressure from research sponsors , instruction from journal editors , and requirements of the research award system . Clearly , commercial and other competing interests of research sponsors and investigators may influence the profile of dissemination of research findings . Limitations of evidence studies on publication bias The most important evidence on publication bias comes from cohort studies showing that the publication of studies is associated with the strength or direction of the results . However , the definition of publication status and classification of study results are often different in empirical studies of publication bias . For time lag bias , time to publication could be measured starting from different time points ( e . g . approval by REC , recruitment of participants , completion of follow - up ) during the process of research . Therefore , bias may be introduced in studies of publication bias because of inevitable subjectivity in the choice of definitions and methods . Large cohort studies on publication and related biases usually included cases that were highly diverse in terms of research questions , designs and other study characteristics . Many factors ( e . g . sample size , design , research question and Chapter 10 Discussion Discussion 82 investigators’ characteristics ) may be associated with both study results and the possibility of publication . Adjusted analyses by some factors may be conducted but it was generally impossible to exclude the impact of confounding factors on the observed association between study results and formal publication . However , confounding factors may not be a problem in many single case studies that provided empirical evidence on publication and related biases . But , evidence from case studies is susceptible to bias due to selective reporting . 123 There are several high - quality empirical studies that were less selective and in which the impact of confounding factors could be controlled . For example , Egger et al . ( 2003 ) 3 and Moher et al . ( 2003 ) 4 used multiple meta - analyses to investigate grey literature and language bias ( see Chapter 3 ) . The results of trials published in English and those published in non - English languages was compared within each meta - analysis that aimed to answer the same clinical question . In empirical studies by Chan et al . , 6 , 7 outcomes reported in published papers were compared with outcomes specified in protocols within each trial , so that the observed outcome reporting bias is unlikely to be due to confounding factors . However , generalisability is still an issue even for findings from these good quality empirical studies . Studies of publication bias themselves may be as vulnerable as other studies to the selective publication of significant or striking findings . 1 , 518 Dubben and Beck - Bornholdt ( 2005 ) used the funnel plot approach , and found no evidence of publication bias in studies of publication bias . 519 They acknowledged that the analysis was handicapped by insufficient power ( with only 26 included studies ) and also by the diverse definitions of publication bias in the primary studies . Song et al . pointed out that the study had other more important limitations so that dissemination bias of studies on publication bias could not be safely excluded . 520 Funnel plot analysis was used in Chapter 3 to detect small study effects in cohort studies of publication bias ( see Figure 6 ) , and the plot was not statistically significantly asymmetric . However , there is still reason to suspect the existence of publication or reporting bias in studies of publication bias . We identified a large number of reports of full publication of meeting abstracts , and the association between study results and full publication had not been reported in most of these reports . It is often unclear whether this association had not been examined , or was not reported because the association proved to be non - significant . In addition , we have mentioned earlier that single case studies that provided empirical evidence on publication bias may be biased because of selective reporting of striking findings . The existence of publication and related biases was usually confirmed by comparing results of published studies with those of unpublished studies . However , the actual impact of such bias is best investigated by a comparison of the result of published studies with the result of a combination of published and unpublished studies . In most cases , the actual impact of publication and related biases was non - significant in a systematic review that combined evidence from all relevant studies . 3 How to deal with publication bias ? The consequences of publication bias were previously overlooked by many leading experts . 2 According to Beveridge , research with non - significant results ‘clutters up the journals and does more harm than good to the author’s reputation in the minds of the discerning . ’ 521 A book about ethics in the dissemination of new knowledge even recommended that ‘it is preferable to publish positive research findings , because they advance knowledge’ . 522 The importance of ‘negative’ findings from research has now been generally recognised . A wide public awareness of detrimental consequences of publication bias has promoted recent efforts to prevent and reduce publication bias . For example , regulatory authorities , journals and research sponsors have taken action to improve the current situation because of several high - profile cases of incomplete disclosure of negative results of trials sponsored by pharmaceutical companies ( see Chapter 7 ) . According to the stage of a literature review , measures to combat publication and related bias can be classified as those before , during or after a literature review ( see Figure 1 ) . 2 Table 11 shows various methods that can be used to deal with different types of publication and related biased . For example , methods that can be used to combat the non - publication of ‘negative’ findings include prospective registration of studies , disclosure of data from unpublished studies , searching for and inclusion of unpublished studies , and assessment of risk of publication bias in systematic reviews .

All rights reserved . 83 The recent development of information technology and electronic publication provides great technical potential to overcome some limitations of conventional printed journals . Publication bias may be reduced by publication in electronic media with unlimited space , direct electronic linkage between references , timely publication , and cost - effective dissemination and archiving . In addition , electronic open - access databases maintained by regulatory bodies , research societies or research sponsors are increasingly important sources of published and unpublished studies . It seems still reasonable to claim that ‘the ideal solution to publication bias is the prospective , universal registration of all studies at their inception’ . 2 Voluntary registration of trials is usually incomplete . The most important development was initiated by the compulsory policy of trial registration adopted by the International Committee of Medical Journals in 2004 . 10 Efforts so far have focused on the registration , publication and disclosure of confirmatory phase III / IV trials due to the perceived immediate consequences . In spite of the greater risk of publication bias , there have been considerable difficulties facing the prospective registration of and disclosure of data from unpublished basic research , observational studies and early stage exploratory clinical trials . Trials registers will only be helpful in reducing publication bias if systematic reviewers include the registries in their search strategies and results of trials are accessible . According to findings presented in Chapter 9 ( see Table 4 ) , only 18 % of the treatment reviews and few reviews of diagnostic and epidemiological studies searched prospective research registers . Certain types of dissemination bias , such as database bias , duplicate publication bias , citation bias and media attention bias , could be dealt with by following approaches adopted in standard systematic reviews ( Table 11 ) . The risk of publication bias may be assessed in a systematic review according to certain risk factors associated with publication bias , although the method has not been adequately investigated in empirical studies ( Chapter 8 ) . Funnel plot and related statistical methods have been widely used to assess publication bias in systematic reviews . Because the interpretation of a funnel plot can often be misleading , some recommendations have been recently proposed about when , and how to use the funnel plot and related statistical tests . 469 , 470 However , these recommendations were based on limited and fast - changing evidence and have not been empirically validated . Many complex statistical methods have been developed to detect or even adjust for assumed publication bias in meta - analysis . But they have never or very rarely been used in practice , possibly because of their complexity and the lack of user - friendly software . More importantly , the usefulness of any statistical methods , simple or complex , may be very limited in typical systematic reviews or meta - analyses ( Chapter 9 ) . It is now generally recognised that sophisticated modelling methods may be used to conduct sensitivity analyses , rather than to provide an adjusted estimate , although the usefulness of such sensitivity analyses is still unclear . Dealing with publication bias in published systematic reviews The 2000 HTA report on publication bias surveyed a sample of 193 systematic reviews published in 1996 , and concluded that the issue of publication bias was largely being ignored , and methods to deal with publication bias were rarely used in these reviews . 2 This updated review found that in 300 systematic reviews published in 2006 there have been some improvements in dealing with publication bias ( Chapter 9 ) . Compared with reviews published in 1996 , recently published reviews made greater efforts to locate and include grey literature or unpublished studies and studies published in non - English languages . In addition , more recently published reviews used methods to assess publication bias in systematic reviews . The previous report found that for publications in 1996 the problems of publication bias were more often dealt with in meta - analyses than in narrative reviews . This phenomenon is also observed in systematic reviews published in 2006 , which may be due to lack of methods that can be used in narrative reviews . We observed some differences between different categories of systematic reviews published in 2006 . Grey literature , unpublished studies or non - English - language studies were more likely to be searched for in reviews of treatment efficacy or diagnostic accuracy than in reviews of epidemiological studies . However , the risk of publication bias was less likely to be tested in reviews of treatment and diagnosis compared Discussion 84 TABLe 11 Publication - related biases and methods to deal with these biases Methods / approaches Dissemination bias N o n - pub li c a t i o n o f ‘ n e g a t i v e ’ r e s u l t s T i m e l a g b i a s O u t c o m e r e p o r t i n g b i a s G r e y li t e r a t u r e b i a s L a n g u a g e b i a s D a t a b a s e b i a s D up li c a t e b i a s C i t a t i o n b i a s M e d i a b i a s Prospective registration of studies , publication of research protocols       Right to publication    Open access policy / regulation , improved research funders’ guidelines    Endorsement of sound reporting guidelines for journal publication  Disclosure of unpublished studies or data     Systematic literature review – Searching for and including grey literature , unpublished studies / data , and non - English - language studies    Assessing risk of publication bias in systematic reviews – Considering risk factors , funnel plot and related tests      Contacting authors for missing data or clarification    Individual patient data meta - analysis   Updating systematic reviews  Confirmatory studies with reviews of epidemiological studies ( Chapter 8 ) . These differences between different types of reviews may be caused by the different availability of sources of grey literature or unpublished studies , and perceived risk of publication bias in different types of primary studies . For example , many initiatives have been taken to prevent biased publication of clinical trials and there are some good sources of grey literature and unpublished trials . At the same time , the limitations of available methods to test publication bias in systematic reviews have been more widely recognised . Therefore , the authors of reviews of treatment efficacy may focus their efforts on the completeness of literature search , rather than on the assessment of publication bias . However , there have been no great efforts to prevent publication bias in epidemiological studies . No good databases of unpublished epidemiological studies could be used by the authors of reviews of epidemiological studies . In view of the great risk of publication bias , authors of reviews of epidemiological studies may have to rely on the available methods to test publication bias , even if the results of such tests are often difficult to interpret .

Therefore , the potential problem of publication and related bias should be taken into consideration by all who are involved in evidence - based decision - making . • Decision - makers , research funders and RECs at the national and international level should continue to support the development of prospective research registration , and the implementation of research open - access policy . • Practical and sound reporting guidelines should be endorsed by journals , and authors should report all measured outcomes in their studies . • Whenever possible , a thorough literature search should be conducted in systematic reviews to identify all relevant studies . Registers of clinical trials and available databases of unpublished studies should be routinely searched for relevant clinical trials . • The impact of grey literature or studies published in languages other than English may be non - significant in many cases . However , the exclusion of grey literature or non - English - language studies may introduce bias in a systematic review , particularly in the field of complementary medicine . Therefore , systematic reviews should not routinely exclude unpublished studies or conference abstracts . The quality of unpublished studies or abstracts should be assessed using the same criteria as for formally published studies . • Outcome reporting bias has been confirmed by new evidence and should be seriously considered in systematic reviews . When relevant studies cannot be included owing to a lack of data on relevant outcomes , original authors should be contacted to clarify whether the outcome was actually measured , and to obtain data on missing outcomes . • Funnel plot and related statistical tests can be used to detect ‘small study effect’ . However , it is usually impossible to separate the influence of factors other than publication bias on the observed association between the estimated effects and sample sizes across studies in meta - analysis . The inappropriate interpretation of the funnel plot and its related tests may be reduced by following recent recommendations in the updated Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews . 469 • The risk of publication bias should be qualitatively assessed according to suspected factors associated with publication bias , including small sample size , small effect size , the shape of a funnel plot , the potential number of studies that may have been conducted , conflicting interests of investigators or research sponsors , and any other direct or indirect evidence . The estimated risk of publication bias should be incorporated into the review’s conclusions . • Large - scale confirmatory studies become necessary after a systematic review has reported a clinically significant finding , but publication bias cannot be safely excluded . Recommendations for future research • Further empirical research is needed to evaluate the effect of prospective registration of studies , open - access policy and improved publication guidelines in the prevention of research dissemination bias . • The role of the developments in computer science and information technology for the prevention and reduction of research dissemination bias needs to be investigated by further research . • There is still a lack of evidence about the impact of publication bias on health decision - making and the outcomes of patient management . Further research is required in this area . • Many systematic reviews still have to depend upon studies identified retrospectively from the published literature , particularly in systematic reviews of basic research and observational studies . Further research is required to develop methods that can be used qualitatively or narratively to assess the risk of publication bias in systematic reviews . • Many available statistical methods to test publication bias have never , or very rarely , been used in systematic reviews . Further research should focus on the practical application of these statistical methods .

The company took legal action against the investigator , Dr Nancy Olivieri , in order to stop the disclosure of the negative finding Rennie 1997 276 , 309 Publication suppression : Bioequivalence of brand name and generic forms of thyroxine sodium A company - sponsored study in 1987 by Dong et al . showed bioequivalence of generic and brand name levothyroxine . The publication of the trial was suppressed for 7 years by the pharmaceutical company due to deleterious effect of results on price of company’s product Skolnick 1998 308 Publication suppression : HTA report on cholesterol - lowering statin drugs A pharmaceutical company tried unsuccessfully to suppress the publication of findings from a health technology assessment on cholesterol - lowering statin drugs by the Canadian Coordinating Office of Health Technology Assessment in 1997 Millstone et al . 1994 304 Publication suppression : Increased somatic cells in cow’s milk and bovine somatotrophin ( BST ) Millstone et al . reported that their meta - analysis with unsupportive results of BST was blocked by a pharmaceutical company using legal rights over raw data Shuchman 1999 307 Publication suppression : Ontario Ministry of Health : omeprazole and draft prescribing guidelines Shuchman reported that a company threatened legal action over draft prescribing guidelines that concluded that all proton pump inhibitors had equivalent effect on peptic ulcers and gastro - oesophageal reflux disease . However , the company responded by saying that the company ‘is not pursuing any legal action against any physician’ 534 McCarthy 2000 310 – 316 Publication suppression : Remune ( HIV - 1 immunogen ) for HIV infection A company - sponsored trial found no difference in efficacy between the vaccine and placebo . The manufacturer of Remune attempted to block the paper’s publication because authors refused to include a post - hoc subgroup analysis Lauritsen 1987 317 Non - publication : Prostaglandin for gastric ulcer A company - sponsored trial compared prostaglandin analogue with ranitidine for gastric ulcer , and stopped in 1985 . Ranitidine was better than prostaglandin in all centres except one . One of the trial centres in Denmark had asked for a copy of the report in March 1986 but had still not received the full report by April 1987 Symmonds et al . 2004 318 and Panahloo 2004 336 Non - publication : Neuraminidase inhibitors ( oseltamivir ) for asthmatic children suffering from influenza Two trials showed no significant difference in time to freedom from illness between children taking the drug and placebo . Data were submitted to European Marketing Authorisation , but not published Wilmshurst 1986 321 and 1987 322 Non - publication : Amrinone A company discontinued trials that showed negative results and failed to report adverse events of amrinone Appendix 16 166 Cases Brief descriptions van Heteren 2001 319 Non - publication : Deep venous thrombosis after using third generation oral contraceptive pills Results of a study on the risk of deep venous thrombosis after using third generation contraceptive pills were submitted to the European Medicines Evaluation Agency in 1999 , but remained unpublished . The company stated that ‘the study was not submitted for publication because it was felt that the study did not offer any new scientific information’ van Veldhuisen and Poole - Wilson 2001 320 Non - publication : ‘Negative’ drug trials in patients with chronic heart failure van Veldhuisen and Poole - Wilson ( 2001 ) discussed three unpublished trials that were terminated prematurely because of increased mortality or adverse effects . These trials were presented at conferences but not fully published Gottlieb 2001 324 , 326 , 327 , 535 Selective publication : Celecoxib for arthritis A trial published in JAMA in 2000 concluded that celecoxib was associated with a lower incidence of symptomatic ulcers and ulcer complications compared with ibuprofen and diclofenac . However , the publication was based on the 6 - month data . Unpublished 12 - month data ( submitted to FDA ) was much less favourable for celecoxib Topol 2004 214 , 215 , 217 , 323 Selective publication : Rofecoxib for arthritis A trial of rofecoxib vs naproxen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis did not include three cases of myocardial infarctions ( MIs ) in the rofecoxib arm . The authors of the trial explained that the three MIs were observed after the cut - off date for reporting cardiovascular events 216 , 536 Steinman 2006 331 Selective publication : Internal industry documents and the promotion of gabapentin for off - label uses Steinman et al . reviewed internal industry documents about the promotion of gabapentin for off - label uses . They found that the company’s ‘management expressed concern that negative results could harm promotional efforts , and several documents indicate the intention to publish and publicis results only if they reflected favourably on gabapentin’ Garland 2004 220 Selective publication : Paroxetine and venlafaxine for depression in children and adolescents Garland reported that none of the large negative trials of paroxetine and venlafaxine in children and adolescents were published . The GlaxoSmithKline internal document revealed that the company experts advised staff to withhold data about SSRI use in children . 222 GSK faces US lawsuit over concealment of trial results in 2004 223 Reines 2004 330 , 337 Selective publication : Rofecoxib for Alzheimer’s disease or cognitive impairment The two published trials of rofecoxib for Alzheimer’s disease only mentioned on - treatment mortality in the text without any statistical analyses , and concluded that rofecoxib is well tolerated . However , the company’s unpublished intention - to - treat analyses and the independent analyses based on data provided by the sponsor in the New Jersey Vioxx litigation found a statistically significant increase in total mortality ( HR 2 . 99 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 55 to 5 . 56 ; and HR 2 . 13 ; 95 % CI : 1 . 55 to 5 . 77 respectively ) 219 Whittington et al . 2004 136 Selective publication : Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( SSRIs ) in children and adolescents Whittington et al . compared results of published trials and unpublished data . They concluded that published data presented a favourable risk - benefit profile , whereas unpublished data indicated that risks could outweigh benefits of these drugs ( except fluoxetine ) in children and adolescents Applegate et al . 1997 328 Selective publication : Isradipine Several investigators of a multicentre trial of isradipine dropped out when the paper was in preparation , because ‘the sponsor of the study was attempting to wield undue influence on the nature of the final paper’ DOI : 10 . 3310 / hta14080 Health Technology Assessment 2010 ; Vol . 14 : No . 8 © 2010 Queen’s Printer and Controller of HMSO . All rights reserved . 167 Cases Brief descriptions Metcalfe et al . 2008 335 Selective ( or delayed ) publication : Trastuzumab ( Herceptin ® ) for early breast cancer An industry - sponsored three - arm trial ( NCCTG - N9831 ) directly compared sequential , concurrent Herceptin , and usual care control . According to a conference abstract in 2005 , interim results indicated concurrent Herceptin was more effective than sequential therapy ( HR 0 . 64 ; 95 % CI : 0 . 46 to 0 . 91 ) . However , a journal paper in 2005 reported only data on concurrent therapy and the control , without including sequential - group data . Because of these missing data , ‘sequential trastuzumab seems more effective than it probably is’ . 335 The principal investigator for the trial responded that the publication of concurrent therapy data was according to an analysis plan prespecified while data on sequential therapy were not sufficiently mature 537 Lenzer 2002 329 Delayed publication : Alteplase ( a thrombolytic agent ) for acute ischaemic stroke A trial found that alteplase did not improve stroke recovery and increased mortality . The negative result was not published for 6 years after the trial’s completion Lenzer 2002 329 Delayed publication : Release of results from a trial on ezetimibe – a cholesterol - lowering drug Negative results of a trial on ezetimibe were released by the company only after a US Congressional inquiry was set up to look into why the results had not been published 2 years after the study was completed Alasbali et al . 2009 332 Discrepancy between results and abstract conclusions Topical prostaglandins Alasbali et al . examined the discrepancy between the statistical significance of the publication’s main outcome measure and its abstract conclusions . The published abstract conclusion was not consistent with the results of the main outcome measure in 18 of 29 industry - funded studies compared with zero of 10 non - industry - funded studies on the efficacy of topical prostaglandin analogues DOI : 10 . 3310 / hta14080 Health Technology Assessment 2010 ; Vol . 14 : No . 8 © 2010 Queen’s Printer and Controller of HMSO .

Title : RM05 / JH29 : Dissemination bias in medical and health related research - an updated synthesis of empirical evidence and a critical assessment of available methods Background Synthesis of published research is becoming increasingly important in providing relevant and valid research evidence to clinical and health policy decision making . However , the validity of research synthesis based on published literature will be threatened if published studies comprise a biased selection of all studies that have been conducted . A previous HTA monograph published in 2000 systematically reviewed studies that provided empirical evidence on publication and related biases , and studies that developed or tested methods for preventing , reducing , or detecting publication and related biases . 1 The review found evidence indicating that studies with significant or favourable results were more likely to be published , or were likely to be published earlier than those with non - significant results . There was limited and indirect evidence indicating the possibility of full publication bias , outcome reporting bias , duplicate publication bias , and language bias . The review identified little empirical evidence relating to the impact of publication and related biases on health policy , clinical decision making and the outcome of patient management . Considering that the spectrum of the accessibility of research results ( dissemination profile ) ranges from completely inaccessible to easily accessible , it was suggested that a single term “dissemination bias” could be used to denote all types of publication and related biases . 1 In the previous HTA report , the available methods for dealing with dissemination biases were classified according to measures that could be taken before , during or after a literature review : to prevent publication bias before a literature review ( eg , prospective registration of trials ) , to reduce or detect publication and related biases during a literature review ( eg , locating grey literature or unpublished studies , and funnel plot related methods ) , and to minimise the impact of publication bias after a literature review ( eg , confirmatory large scale trials , updating systematic reviews ) . 1 It was concluded that the ideal solution to publication bias is the prospective , universal registration of all studies at their inception . It was concluded , although debatable , that available statistical methods for detecting and adjusting publication bias should be mainly used for the purpose of sensitivity analysis . Since the publication of the HTA review of publication and related biases , many new studies on publication and related biases have been published . For example , Egger et al ( 2003 ) provided further empirical evidence on publication bias , language bias , grey literature bias , and MEDLINE index bias , 2 and Moher et al ( 2003 ) evaluated language bias in meta - analyses of randomised controlled trials . 3 Recently , more convincing evidence on outcome reporting bias has been published . 4 , 5 The new empirical evidence may contradict or strengthen the empirical evidence included in the previous HTA report . Funnel plot and related statistical methods have been applied in new studies to collections of meta - analyses to estimate possible publication bias in systematic reviews . 6 - 8 There are also new published studies that investigated methods for dealing with publication bias ( for example 9 - 11 ) . Dubben and Beck - Bornholdt ( 2005 ) used the funnel plot approach , and found no evidence of publication bias in studies of publication bias . 12 They acknowledged that the analysis was handicapped by insufficient power ( with only 26 included studies ) and also by the diverse definitions of publication bias in the primary studies . However , Song et al pointed out that the study had other , more important , limitations so that dissemination bias of studies on publication bias could not be safely excluded . 13 Purpose ( aims , objectives ) 1 . To identify all relevant empirical studies published since 1998 . Empirical studies are defined as those that provide empirical evidence on the existence , consequences , causes and / or risk factors of dissemination bias . 2 . To identify all relevant methodological studies published since 1998 . Methodological studies are those that have developed or investigated methods for preventing , reducing or detecting dissemination bias . 3 . To categorise empirical and methodological studies identified according to a conceptual framework of dissemination profile , and to critically appraise studies that provided direct empirical evidence .

To synthesise findings from newly identified and previously included studies to enable us to assess whether each type of dissemination bias does exist , and if so the extent of the effect that it may have on results of systematic reviews and hence decision making . 5 . To assess the possibility of dissemination bias of studies that provide empirical evidences on dissemination bias . 6 . To assess the usefulness and limitations of available methods , and resources required to use these methods to combat each type of dissemination bias , through synthesis of the methodological studies . 7 . To examine measures taken in a representative sample of published systematic reviews to prevent , reduce and detect different types of dissemination bias . We will include both narrative and quantitative ( meta - analytic ) systematic reviews that evaluated effect of healthcare interventions , systematic reviews that evaluated the accuracy of diagnostic tests , and systematic reviews of epidemiological studies that evaluated association of risk factors and health outcomes . 8 . To bring together current evidence on the existence and scale of each type of dissemination bias , effects and costs of methods to combat these biases , and current use of these methods to create recommendations for reviewers , policy makers , health professionals and service users , and to disseminate these recommendations . Investigation methods The review contains three parts : ( 1 ) review of empirical and methodological studies ; ( 2 ) an assessment of published systematic reviews ; ( 3 ) synthesising all findings , providing and disseminating recommendations . Part 1 . Review of empirical and methodological studies Methods used in the previous HTA report will be modified to identify and categorise relevant studies . We will adopt a new framework to categorise relevant studies , and important studies will be assessed using a more critical and structured approach . Details of the review methods are described below and in the Figure . U Criteria for inclusion and literature search strategies A preliminary literature search indicated that there are a large number of potentially relevant studies in fields of medical and health related research , and searches in the area of social sciences produced few studies in the initial review , so we plan to focus on dissemination bias in health and related research . We will include studies that provide empirical evidence on the existence , consequences , causes , and / or risk factors of types of dissemination bias ; and studies that develop or evaluate methods for preventing , reducing or detecting dissemination bias . Literature searches for methodological studies are often difficult because of ill - defined boundaries and inappropriate indexing in commonly used bibliographic databases . 14 Our previous experience and initial searching suggests that the most productive and efficient methods include searching the Cochrane Methodology Register , references of retrieved articles and citation search of key studies . We will search the Cochrane Methodology Register ( CRM ) and MEDLINE for relevant empirical and methodological studies published since 1998 . We will compare studies identified from the MEDLINE and those identified from the Cochrane Methodology Register , to check the completeness and usefulness of the two bibliographic databases for methodological reviews . Key words used in the search of electronic databases will include : publication bias , dissemination bias , language bias , national bias , country bias , reporting bias , grey literature bias , conference / abstract bias , full publication bias , citation bias , time lag / delay bias , reference bias , selection bias , location bias , duplication or multiple publication bias , database bias , index bias , and file drawer . References ( titles with or without abstracts ) gathered by searching the CMR and MEDLINE will be assessed independently by two reviewers for inclusion or exclusion . Any disagreement will be discussed . We will also search EMBASE ( from 2005 to 2007 , as EMBASE is searched for the Methodology Register , but we will ensure that we have included the most recent references ) , Ahmed ( 1998 - 2007 ) , Cinahl ( 1998 - 2007 ) , PsychInfo ( 1998 - 2007 ) , SIGLE ( 1998 - 2007 ) and Dissertation Abstracts ( 1998 - 2007 ) for any additional relevant studies . Searching of EMBASE , Ahmed , Cinahl , PsychInfor , SIGLE , and Dissertation Abstracts will be conducted by one reviewer . References of retrieved reviews and studies will be examined by one reviewer to identify additional relevant studies , including any relevant studies published before 1998 but Appendix 18 186 - 3 – missed in the previous HTA report . Citations of the key studies will also be searched . The literature search will not be restricted by publication language . We have conducted a preliminary search of the Cochrane Methodology Register for relevant studies that published since 1998 . According to titles ( with or without abstracts ) of identified references , there are a large number of possibly relevant studies ( 300 - 400 , after excluding obvious duplicates ) . More than 200 references were empirical studies , including publication bias ( n = 26 ) , publication of conference abstracts ( n = 66 ) , outcome reporting bias ( n = 26 ) , country or language bias ( n = 39 ) , grey literature ( n = 13 ) , time lag bias ( n = 15 ) , causes of publication bias ( n = 16 ) , citation bias ( n = 16 ) . We found 58 studies of methods for dealing with publication bias , including 30 studies of statistical methods , 17 studies of literature search methods , and 11 studies of other methods ( eg , trial registration or large scale confirmation trials ) . U Classification of identified studies According to findings from our preliminary literature search , relevant studies are numerous in quantity and substantially diverse in quality . It is crucial to classify identified studies using a pre - specified structure to facilitate subsequent assessment and synthesis ( Figure ) . First , one reviewer will classify identified studies as ( 1 ) evidence studies or ( 2 ) methodological studies . Evidence studies are defined as studies that provide empirical evidence on the existence , extent , consequences , causes or risk factors of dissemination bias . Methodological studies are defined as those that develop or investigate methods for preventing , reducing or detecting dissemination bias . Some studies may be classified as both an evidence and a methods study . U Review of evidence studies Evidence studies will be categorised into various types of dissemination bias , according to a framework of dissemination profile ( that is , accessibility of research results ) : non - publication ( never , or delayed ) ; incomplete publication ( e . g . biased outcome reporting , data dredged subgroup effects , biased full publication of conference abstracts ) ; published but difficult to access ( e . g . grey literature , language bias , database bias ) ; other biased dissemination activities ( e . g . citation bias , duplicate bias ) . It is possible that some studies may be included in more than one category . Then evidence studies will be further separated into two groups : studies that provided direct evidence , and studies that provided indirect evidence . Direct evidence refers to data or observations that could be used to directly indicate dissemination bias , including admissions of bias on the part of those involved in the publication process , comparison of the results of published and unpublished studies , and the prospective or retrospective follow - up of dissemination profile of cohorts of studies . Indirect evidence refers to observations that could be explained indirectly by dissemination bias but other alternative explanations could not be excluded . For instance , a disproportionately high proportion of positive findings in the published literature might provide indirect evidence , as might larger effect sizes in smaller studies compared with larger studies . We will apply a checklist of quality assessment to critically appraise studies that provided direct empirical evidence and studies that assessed association between sample size and effects in multiple meta - analyses , with regard to scientific rigorousness , the sample’s representativeness , and appropriateness of data analyses and interpretation . Topic specific items will be considered if judged appropriate for different types of bias . More details about the proposed quality assessment are described below . • Scientific rigorousness : We aim to detect potential threats to the validity of study results . For example , prospective studies are more valid than retrospective studies . Selection and inclusion of samples may be more or less biased , and whether assessments and judgements were independently duplicated . • Generalisability : It is important to consider whether results of studies could be generalisable to different fields of research , settings , and designs . For example , dissemination bias in randomised trials may not be similar to that in epidemiological studies . • Appropriateness of data analysis : We will assess whether the data analysis method is appropriate to address the objectives of the study . • Appropriateness of interpretation : Limitations of the study should be considered when results of a study were interpreted . Relevant studies included in the previous HTA report 1 will also be critically appraised using the same checklist .

Results of included empirical evidence studies will be independently categorised by two reviewers as positive ( significant dissemination bias ) , non - significant ( no clear dissemination bias ) , or can’t tell ( see Appendix 1 ) . Then we will examine the association of the results of empirical studies and studies’ quality and dissemination profile ( including time of publication , journal impact factor , number of citations after a given period of publication , and study’s impact on guidelines / recommendations for systematic reviews ) . U Review of methodological studies There may be multiple studies investigating the same method . Method studies will be categorised according to methods they investigated , to generate a list of available methods and corresponding studies identified . Then each method will be cross - classified from two aspects : ( 1 ) type of dissemination bias and ( 2 ) stage of literature review ( see Figure ) . It is possible that the same method may be relevant to different types of dissemination bias or applicable to the different stage of a literature review . Using a standardised method classification sheet ( Appendix 2 ) , the review of method studies will be conducted by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer . Disagreements will be resolved by discussion . Based on findings of included studies , available methods will be critically appraised in terms of underlying assumptions , conditions under which the method could be used , usefulness , limitations , and resource required . U Presentation and summary of literature review findings Data extracted from the included studies and results of critically appraisal will be presented in tables and described narratively . If appropriate , results from individual studies will be quantitatively pooled ( for example , pooled odds ratio of full publication of conference abstracts with statistically significant results versus those with statistically non - significant results ) . Results of critical appraisal will be taken into consideration to interpret and explain findings from empirical and methodological studies . We will highlight whether findings from studies newly identified contradict or strengthen findings from studies included in the previous HTA report . Part 2 . Assessment of a sample of published systematic reviews In the previous HTA report , 193 systematic reviews taken from the Database of Abstract of Reviews of Effectiveness ( Centre for Reviews and Dissemination , University of York ) were used to identify further evidence of dissemination bias and to illustrate the methods used in systematic reviews for dealing with publication bias . However , there are several shortcomings in the previous assessment . First , systematic reviews included in the DARE database might on average have better quality than those from the general bibliographic databases ( such as MEDLINE ) so that the representativeness of systematic reviews assessed in the previous HTA report may be questionable . Secondly , 91 % of systematic reviews that evaluated the effectiveness of healthcare interventions and 9 % that evaluated the accuracy of diagnostic technologies were not separately assessed . The problem of dissemination bias might be different between the two types of systematic reviews . Thirdly , systematic reviews of epidemiological studies of association between risk factors and health outcomes were not included in the previous HTA report . To overcome these shortcomings , we plan to obtain a representative sample of systematic reviews from the general bibliographic database MEDLINE , including ( 1 ) systematic reviews of studies on effects of healthcare interventions , ( 2 ) systematic reviews of studies on accuracy of diagnostic tests , and ( 3 ) systematic reviews of epidemiological studies on association between risk factors and health outcomes . A preliminary search of MEDLINE using “systematic review” or “meta - analysis” ( in titles or in abstracts ) identified 2779 English - language references published in 2005 . We examined the first 300 of the 2779 references and identified 109 systematic reviews that evaluated effects of healthcare interventions ( including preventive interventions ) , 13 systematic reviews of studies of diagnostic tests , and 53 systematic reviews of epidemiological studies ( including 18 systematic reviews of genetic studies ) . This preliminary exercise indicates that there are about 1009 systematic review of effects of health interventions , about 120 systematic reviews of diagnostic tests , and about 490 systematic reviews of epidemiological studies . The following approach is based on findings from this preliminary work . DOI : 10 . 3310 / hta14080 Health Technology Assessment 2010 ; Vol . 14 : No . 8 © 2010 Queen’s Printer and Controller of HMSO . All rights reserved . 189 - 6 – U Identifying and sampling systematic reviews First , we will search MEDLINE for systematic reviews published in 2005 . References identified from MEDLINE will be examined by one reviewer and categorised as systematic reviews of effects of healthcare interventions , systematic reviews of accuracy of diagnostic tests , or systematic reviews of epidemiological studies ( genetic epidemiology or not ) . Then we will use computer - generated random numbers to obtain a random sample of 100 systematic reviews of effects of healthcare interventions , 50 systematic reviews of accuracy of diagnostic tests , and 100 systematic reviews of epidemiological studies ( of which 50 will be reviews of genetic epidemiology studies ) from all identified systematic reviews . U Extracting data from included systematic reviews The data extraction from included systematic reviews will be independently conducted by two reviewers to collect the following information ( see preliminary data extraction sheet in Appendix 3 ) : type of review ( effect , diagnostic , epidemiological ) , method of data synthesis ( narrative or quantitative ) , whether the issue of publication bias was considered , whether unpublished studies or those published in non - English languages were searched for and included ; methods used for dealing with publication bias ; any evidence on the existence , extent and consequence of publication bias . A checklist will also be applied independently by two reviewers to assess the overall quality of included systematic reviews ( see Appendix 3 ) . Any disagreements between the two reviewers will be resolved by discussion . U Analysing data from included systematic reviews Data extracted from systematic reviews of effects of healthcare interventions , systematic reviews of accuracy of diagnostic test , and systematic reviews of epidemiological studies will be separately presented and compared . We will also examine the subgroup of genetic epidemiology reviews separately . We will compare findings from narrative systematic reviews and quantitative systematic reviews ( meta - analyses ) . Systematic reviews of effects of healthcare interventions and systematic reviews of diagnostic accuracy published in 2005 will be compared with those included in the previous HTA report to examine whether the reporting and treatment of dissemination bias has improved over time . Part 3 . Synthesising findings from Part 1 and Part 2 Findings from Part 1 will illuminate the existence or otherwise , extent and potential impact on policy of different types of dissemination bias , and suggest a range of methods for dealing with such biases . Part 2 will provide findings about what actually happens in the practice of systematic reviews . Part 3 aims to compare findings from Part 1 and Part 2 , and to identify gaps between empirical and methodological research on dissemination bias , and actual practice of systematic reviews ( see the proposed summary table below ) . For example , considerable resource might be wasted in systematic reviews identifying , translating , and assessing studies published in languages other than English if evidence suggests that language bias is not a problem . Some statistical methods developed may have rarely been used in practice for various reasons ( eg , too complicated or no additional advantages as compared with simple methods ) . Bias category Evidence of existence Methods to combat this bias Usefulness and limitations of the method Resources required to use the method Type of dissemination bias Based on literature review Based on literature review Effect of the methods , as well as limitations , based on literature review and a sample of systematic reviews Including time , staff , and costs .
