To elucidate the molecular and cell biological mechanism for trans - enhancement , we performed an shRNA screen of several hundred genes involved in organelle and membrane trafﬁcking in immature human mono - cyte - derived dendritic cells ( MDDCs ) . We identiﬁed TSPAN7 and DNM2 , which control actin nucleation and stabilization , as having important and distinct roles in limiting HIV - 1 endocytosis and in maintaining virus particles on dendrites , which is required for efﬁ - cient transfer to T lymphocytes . Further character - ization of this process may provide insights not only into the role of DCs in transmission and dissem - ination of HIV - 1 but also more broadly into mecha - nisms controlling capture and internalization of pathogens . INTRODUCTION Despite major progress in unraveling the mechanism of the HIV replication cycle in human T lymphocytes , the role of cells involved in the innate response to HIV and other retroviruses is only now receiving growing attention . Dendritic cells ( DCs ) serve a key function in host defense , linking innate detection of microbes to activation of pathogen - speciﬁc adaptive immune responses ( Banchereau et al . , 2000 ) . DCs express cell surface receptors for HIV - 1 entry but undergo very limited productive infection as a result of host cell restriction factors ( Wu and Kewal - Ramani , 2006 ) . DCs do , however , facilitate infection of co - cultured T - helper cells through a process of trans - enhancement ( Cameron et al . , 1992 ; Geijtenbeek et al . , 2000 ) . A cell - intrinsic sensor for HIV - 1 , cGAS , has the potential to activate the type I interferon response to reverse - transcribed viral DNA in DCs but is not typically engaged owing to a block in reverse transcrip - tion mediated by the host dinucleotide triphosphate ( dNTP ) hy - drolase SAMHD1 ( Gao et al . , 2013 ; Laguette et al . , 2011 ; Lahaye et al . , 2013 ; Manel et al . , 2010 ) . The virus appears to have evolved to avoid infecting these cells , and it has been proposed that it instead exploits DCs to facilitate rapid infection of a large pool of T cells and , perhaps , to reside in non - replicating reser - voirs within DCs ( Wu and KewalRamani , 2006 ) . trans - enhancement is deﬁned as the capacity of DCs to augment infection of T cells with a minimal HIV inoculum ( Cameron et al . , 1992 ; Geijtenbeek et al . , 2000 ) . Binding of the HIV envelope glycoprotein to mannose receptors has been implicated in trans - enhancement , although the C - type lectin DC - SIGN is not absolutely required ( Boggiano et al . , 2007 ; Geij - tenbeek et al . , 2000 ; Kwon et al . , 2002 ) . Recently , SIGLEC - 1 ( CD169 ) was described as an interferon - inducible receptor for HIV - 1 transfer from lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) - matured DCs to T cells ( Izquierdo - Useros et al . , 2012 ) . trans - enhancement was originally thought to involve classical endocytosis ( Kwon et al . , 2002 ) , but it was later found that the internalized virus was still accessible to solvent ( i . e . , soluble CD4 could inactivate captured HIV ) ( Cavrois et al . , 2007 ) . This discrepancy was potentially reconciled by the observation that , in mature DCs , HIV - 1 is internalized in a tetraspanin - rich compartment ( containing CD81 ) , called the ‘‘invaginated pocket , ’’ which is still accessible to solvent but is topologically distinct from the cell membrane ( Yu et al . , 2008 ) . To gain more insight into the mechanism of trans - enhance - ment , we performed a short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) screen in immature human primary monocyte - derived DCs ( MDDCs ) . We focused on several hundred genes involved in organelle and membrane trafﬁcking to identify those that impact HIV - 1 transfer , and identiﬁed and validated the function of tetraspa - nin 7 ( TSPAN7 ) and dynamin 2 ( DNM2 ) . TSPAN7 is localized at the plasma membrane and has a critical role in neurite outgrowth ( Bassani et al . , 2012 ) . The large GTPase DNM2 plays a key role in endocytosis ( Ferguson and De Camilli , 2012 ) and is recruited to the neck of coated pits where it can assemble into a collar structure to mediate membrane ﬁssion . More recently , DNM2 was described as an important regulator at the interface between the membrane and the dy - namic actin cytoskeleton , modulating actin nucleation and promoting the stability of the actin ﬁlament network ( Ferguson and De Camilli , 2012 ; Gu et al . , 2010 ; Lee and De Camilli , 2002 ; Orth et al . , 2002 ) . We show here that during HIV - 1 trans - fer from DCs , TSPAN7 and DNM2 control nucleation and cortical stabilization of actin , which limits HIV - 1 endocytosis and maintains the virus on dendrites for efﬁcient transfer to T lymphocytes .

RESULTS RNAi Screen for Genes Involved in DC to T Cell HIV Transfer To identify genes involved in the transfer of HIV - 1 from DCs to T lymphocytes , we performed an shRNA screen , in human pri - mary - monocyte - derived dendritic cells ( MDDCs ) , of 455 genes ( 4 or 5 shRNAs per gene ) whose products are involved in organ - elle and membrane trafﬁcking ( Table S1 ) . We used Vpx - contain - ing SIV virus - like particles to achieve highly efﬁcient transduction of MDDCs with lentiviral vectors encoding the shRNAs . To assess the transfer of HIV - 1 from MDDCs to T cells , we co - cultured transduced MDDCs at a ratio of 1 : 1 with autologous CD4 + T cells activated with IL - 2 and PHA ( Figure 1A ) . The cul - tures were infected with a replication - competent CXCR4 - tropic HIV - 1 encoding GFP in place of Nef , and the proportion of in - fected GFP + CD4 + T cells was assessed by ﬂow cytometry after 2 days . There was no detectable replication of HIV - 1 in MDDCs , and presence or absence of Nef had no impact on viral transfer from MDDCs to T cells ( M . M . M . , unpublished data ) . Several con - trols were included for each donor : the PLK0 . 1 vector with a scrambled shRNA , empty vector , or transduction without vector , allowing assessment of nonspeciﬁc effects due to transduction and / or processing of shRNAs . The variation of transfer among the controls was lower than 5 % on average , with a maximal vari - ation never reaching > 20 % ( Figures S1A and S1B ) . Among the targeted genes , we found a > 30 % decrease in HIV - 1 transfer with at least two shRNAs for 43 genes and with one shRNA for 38 genes . Targeting of another 25 genes with at least two shRNAs per gene and of 28 genes with one shRNA increased transfer by at least 30 % ( Figure 1B ; Table S1 ) . Among the hits for which we observed reduced HIV - 1 transfer , there was enrichment for genes involved in actin nucleation ( 18 genes out of 81 ) and / or membrane protrusions ( 10 genes out of 81 ) ( Figure S1C ) , including four out of the seven subunits of the ARP2 / 3 complex . Direct regulators of this complex , including WASP and CDC42 ( Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ) , also scored in the assay , as did CFL1 , which promotes debranching of actin ﬁla - ments and whose knockdown enhanced HIV - 1 transfer ( Martin et al . , 2006 ) . Proteins whose functions are mainly in formation and stabilization of cortical actin , including ARL13B ( Casalou et al . , 2014 ) and DNM2 ( Ferguson and De Camilli , 2012 ; Gu et al . , 2010 ; Lee and De Camilli , 2002 ; Menon et al . , 2014 ; Orth et al . , 2002 ) , were similarly required for efﬁcient HIV - 1 transfer . Hits that resulted in increased HIV - 1 transfer were enriched for genes ( 24 out of 53 ) involved in several endocytic pathways ( Fig - ure S1D ) . These included genes involved in clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) such as those encoding clathrin heavy and light chain ( CLTC , CLTB and CLTA ) ; members of the clathrin - associated protein complexes AP - 1 ( AP1M1 ; AP1G1 ) , AP - 2 ( AP2M1 ) , and AP - 4 ( AP4M1 ) ; and myosin Va ( MYO5A ) , an actin - based motor protein ( Boettner et al . , 2012 ; Doherty and McMahon , 2009 ) . Genes encoding molecules involved in caveo - lin - mediated endocytosis included CAV3 , CAV1 , and FLOT1 ( Glebov et al . , 2006 ) . Together , these results thus suggested roles for actin nucleation and endocytosis in enhancing or limiting HIV - 1 transfer , respectively . TSPAN7 Is Required for HIV - 1 Transfer and Dendrite Formation Among the genes whose knockdown resulted in robust decrease in transfer ( Figure 1B ) , TSPAN7 caught our attention , as it is a yet uncharacterized member of the tetraspanin family , for which several members ( CD9 , CD63 , CD81 , and CD82 ) were reported to be involved in HIV - 1 cell - to - cell transfer and / or trafﬁcking ( Garcia et al . , 2005 ) . We conﬁrmed , using blood from multiple donors , a reproducible nearly 50 % decrease of HIV - 1 transfer using shRNA sequences targeting different re - gions of TSPAN7 as compared to scrambled shRNA ( Figures 2A and 2B ) ( Bassani et al . , 2012 ) . The efﬁciency and speciﬁcity of TSPAN7 knockdown were assessed by both qPCR and immu - noblot ( Figures S2A and S2B ) . Additionally , TSPAN7 expression was induced during differentiation of MDDCs from monocytes in the presence of granulocyte - macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) and IL - 4 and was correlated with appearance of dendrites ( Figure S2C ; M . M . M . , unpublished data ) . By confocal microscopy , there was a marked change in DC morphology resulting from reduced TSPAN7 expression . Phalloidin staining revealed a loss of long and thin actin - rich membrane extensions , or dendrites , upon TSPAN7 knockdown ( Figure 2C ) . Transmission and three - dimensional scanning elec - tron microscopy ( 3D - SEM ) analysis conﬁrmed this effect and showed that a decrease in TSPAN7 expression shifted the bal - ance from dendrites toward formation of short and large blebs of the plasma membrane ( Figures 2D and 2E ; Movie S1 ) . TSPAN7 Prevents HIV - 1 Redistribution from Dendrites to Macropinosomes To study localization of incoming HIV - 1 particles by confocal microscopy , we exposed MDDCs to replication - competent virus containing a Gag - internal GFP ( iGFP ) , as previously described ( Hu¨bner et al . , 2007 ) . Upon TSPAN7 shRNA knock - down , the loss of dendrites was accompanied by redistribution of HIV - 1 particles from dendrites to cytosolic compartments , observed by both confocal ( Figure 3A ) and transmission electron microscopy ( Figures 3B and 3C ) . By comparison , electron mi - croscopy of control co - cultures revealed synaptic clefts with numerous HIV - 1 particles in very close vicinity of dendrites , but Figure 1 .

HIV - 1 - loaded vesicles were abundant only in the infected T cells ( Figure S2D ) . Aggregates of HIV - 1 were present in large vesicles ( between 0 . 3 and 1 m M ) that also internalized dextran , a marker of macropinosome - like vesicles ( 94 . 8 % ± 5 % colocalization ) ( Wang et al . , 2014 ) ( Figures 3B , 3D , and S2E ) , contained MHC class II and Rab7 ( 97 . 5 % ± 2 . 9 % and 93 . 38 % ± 5 % colocaliza - tion respectively ) , a marker for late endosomes , and were sur - rounded by the tetraspanin CD81 ( 25 . 8 % ± 9 . 3 % colocalization ) , which is usually localized at the plasma membrane and in endo - somes ( Figure 3D ) . By electron microscopy , we were able to observe HIV - 1 internalization through mechanisms resembling bleb retraction ( Figure 3B , bottom ) . There was no co - localization of HIV - 1 aggregates with clathrin - or caveolin - positive vesicles ( 1 . 2 % ± 0 . 9 % and 1 % ± 0 . 6 % colocalization , respectively ) or with markers of early endosomes ( EEA1 ) and lysosomes ( Lamp2 ) ( 6 % ± 6 . 4 % and 3 . 5 % ± 5 . 3 % colocalization , respec - tively ) ( Figure S2F ; M . M . M . , unpublished data ) . Uptake by MDDCs of both dextran and HIV - 1 particles was markedly enhanced upon knockdown of TSPAN7 ( Figures 3E and S2G – S2J ) , consistent with increased macropinocytosis activity . Together , these observations suggest that the decrease in HIV - 1 transfer from MDDCs to T cells is linked to the loss of actin - rich dendrites and to an increase in virus uptake in macropinosomes . Inhibition of ARP2 / 3 Mimics TSPAN7 Phenotypes The ARP2 / 3 complex performs critical functions in formation of membrane protrusions and actin - rich structures , catalyzing actin ﬁlament nucleation required for assembly of actin ﬁlament net - works ( Goley and Welch , 2006 ) . Treatment of MDDCs with CK666 and CK869 , speciﬁc inhibitors of ARP2 / 3 - mediated actin nucleation , reduced viral transfer ( Figures 4A , 4B , and S3A ) ( He - trick et al . , 2013 ) . The drugs had no effect on cell - free infection of T cells with HIV - 1 , supporting a speciﬁc role for actin nucleation in DCs during viral transfer ( Figure S3A ) . The decrease in transfer was accompanied by loss of actin - rich dendrites ( Figures 4C and 4D ) , increased HIV - 1 capture ( Figures 4E and 4F ) , and increased virion uptake in macropinocytic - like vesicles ( M . M . M . , unpub - lished data ) . There was a global increase of macropinocytosis - like endocytic processes upon inhibition of actin nucleation , with accumulation of dextran in MDDCs ( Figures S3B – S3D ) . There was no synergistic or additive effect on HIV - 1 transfer when ARP2 / 3 was inhibited in MDDCs treated with TSPAN7 shRNAs ( Figures 4G and 4H ) . Dendritic to T cell contact is required for HIV - 1 trans - enhance - ment ( McDonald et al . , 2003 ) . There was no change in the num - ber of contacts between MDDCs and T cells upon inhibition of ARP2 / 3 - mediated actin nucleation or TSPAN7 knockdown , as assessed by ﬂow cytometry analysis of doublet formation ( Fig - ure S3E ) and confocal microscopy analysis , in which conjugate formation was deﬁned as contact between plasma membranes and enrichment of actin staining at the zone of contact ( Figures S3F and S3G ) . However , the nature of the contacts was different , with a shift from dendrite - mediated contact to tight contact be - tween plasma membranes ( Figures S3F and S3G ) . No differ - ences in surface expression of molecules previously implicated in DC - T cell interactions and HIV - 1 transfer , including LFA - 1 , ICAM - 1 , SIGLEC - 1 , DC - SIGN , and DC - IR , were detected by ﬂow cytometry analysis ( M . M . M . , unpublished data ) . Thus , decreased HIV - 1 transfer following inhibition of actin nucleation was most likely due to the loss of dendrites and an accumulation of HIV - 1 in macropinocytic structures and not to reduced con - tact of MDDCs with T cells . Requirement for DNM2 in HIV - 1 Transfer Independent of Dendrite Formation Dynamin 2 ( DNM2 ) , a strong hit in the shRNA screen ( Figures 1 , 5A , and 5B ) , has been implicated in nucleation and stabilization of actin networks ( Gu et al . , 2010 ; Lee and De Camilli , 2002 ; Me - non et al . , 2014 ; Orth et al . , 2002 ) . The speciﬁcity of DNM2 knockdown and function was validated by qPCR ( Figure S4A ) and by use of the dynamin - speciﬁc inhibitors dynasore and Dyn V - 32 ( Yamada et al . , 2009 ) that inhibited HIV - 1 infection of T cells only when MDDCs were present in the co - culture ( Figures 5C and S4B ) . After DNM2 knockdown , there was a 3 - fold in - crease in HIV - 1 capture ( Figures 5D and S4C ) and increased dextran internalization by MDDCs , similar to what was observed with TSPAN7 knockdown ( Figures S4D and S4E ) . There was no difference in contacts between T cells and MDDCs ( Figure S4F ) or in surface expression of LFA - 1 , ICAM - 1 , SIGLEC - 1 , DC - IR , Figure 4 .

M . , unpublished data ) . HIV - 1 was relocal - ized from dendrites to aggregates ( Figures 5E and 5F ) that were also positive for dextran uptake , Rab7 , HLA - DP - DQ - DR , and CD81 ( Figure 5G ) ( 89 . 4 % ± 6 % , 92 . 1 % ± 3 . 4 % , 95 . 1 % ± 3 . 9 % , and 21 . 1 % ± 5 . 1 % colocalization , respectively ) but differed from clathrin - or caveolae - associated vesicles , early endosomes , and lysosomes ( 4 . 7 % ± 1 . 4 % , 8 . 9 % ± 7 . 5 % , 1 . 8 % ± 1 . 6 % , and 1 . 4 % ± 1 . 8 % colocalization respectively ) ( Fig - ure S4G ) . No synergy or additive effects were noticed when cells were treated with CK666 , dynasore , or a combination of both drugs , suggesting that they inhibit HIV - 1 transfer through the same pathway ( Figure 5H ) . In contrast to inhibition of TSPAN7 expression , there was no noticeable reduction of actin - rich dendrites , as assessed by confocal microscopy , after blockade of DNM2 expression ( Fig - ure 5E ) . Electron microscopy revealed an unusual mix of den - drites and blebs at the surface of the dendritic cells ( Figure S4H , left ) , with large vesicles ( from 0 . 3 to 1 m M ) that are likely macro - pinosomes containing HIV - 1 particles ( Figure S4H , right ) . Although TSPAN7 and DNM2 differed in their requirement for dendrite formation and / or maintenance , there was disruption in the continuity of phalloidin staining beneath the plasma mem - brane when either molecule was knocked down , as shown by analysisandmeasurement ofmultiplezstackimages ( FigureS5 ) . Disruption of the actin ﬁlaments following inhibition of TSPAN7 or DNM2 expression was associated with mislocalization of HIV - 1 particles beyond the cortical region adjacent to the plasma membrane ( Figure S5A ) . Together , these ﬁndings suggest that TSPAN7 and DNM2 are critical for establishment and / or mainte - nance of a stable cortical actin barrier that limits HIV - 1 uptake by dendritic cells . Inhibition of Macropinocytosis Can Rescue HIV - 1 Transfer upon DNM2 Knockdown in MDDCs To assess the impact of HIV - 1 internalization on its transfer to T cells , we treated MDDCs with inhibitors of the main endocytic pathways , before co - culturing them with HIV - 1 and T cells . We established optimal conditions to inhibit clathrin - or caveolae - mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis in MDDCs by respectively using chlorpromazine ( CPZ ) , nystatin , or rottlerin ( Figures S6A and S6B ) ( Ivanov , 2008 ; Sarkar et al . , 2005 ) . We observed enhanced HIV - 1 transfer with all inhibitors , but most prominently with rottlerin ( Figures 6A and S6C ) . The increase in HIV - 1 transfer was accompanied by decreased HIV - 1 internali - zation , most marked in the presence of rottlerin , as monitored by ﬂow cytometry after p24 intracellular staining ( Figures 6B and 6C ) . Increased HIV - 1 transfer was also observed in the pres - ence of other drugs ( IPA - 3 [ 10 m M ] , NEIPA [ 10 m M ] , and antimycin A1 [ 10 m M ] ) that block macropinocytosis ( Figures S6D and S6E ) . These results suggested that uptake of HIV - 1 by way of multi - ple pathways can reduce transfer to T cells . We found that , indeed , MDDCs can internalize small numbers of HIV - 1 particles in vesicles containing either clathrin , caveolin , or , more frequently , internalized ﬂuorescently labeled dextran ( 26 . 9 % ± 6 . 8 % , 16 . 75 % ± 5 . 61 % , and 53 . 81 % ± 12 . 5 % colocalization , respectively ) ( Figure S6F ) . Macropinocytic events , depicted by plasma membrane rufﬂes folding back on HIV - 1 , were visible by electron microscopy ( Figure S6G ) . HIV uptake by MDDCs thus appears to involve multiple mechanisms , although macropi - nocytosis is favored . The magnitude of this uptake differs from the much more prominent virion internalization observed almost exclusively in dextran - containing compartments following inhibi - tion of TSPAN7 or DNM2 expression . We next examined whether accumulation of HIV - 1 in macropi - nosome - like vesicles , observed after TSPAN7 and DNM2 knock - down , contributes to decreasing HIV - 1 transfer by lowering availability of HIV - 1 at the plasma membrane . MDDCs in which TSPAN7 or DNM2 were knocked down were incubated with CPZ , rottlerin or nystatin and HIV - 1 transfer to T cells was as - sessed . The endocytosis inhibitors had no apparent effect on in - hibition of transfer following TSPAN7 knockdown , despite their enhancement of transfer in control shRNA - treated MDDCs ( Fig - ures 6D and 6E ) . However , inhibition of macropinocytosis specif - ically restored HIV - 1 transfer after knockdown of DNM2 , to a level similar in magnitude to that observed in control shRNA - treated MDDCs ( Figures 6D and 6E ) . Thus , inhibition of HIV - 1 up - take by macropinocytosis overcomes dependency on DNM2 , but not TSPAN7 , for efﬁcient HIV - 1 transfer to T cells . Figure 5 .

Inhibition of Actomyosin Contraction Rescues Dendrite Formation and HIV - 1 Transfer As inhibition of actin nucleation leads to the replacement of actin - rich dendrites with blebs , we next wondered what would be the impact on HIV - 1 transfer if we blocked bleb formation . For this purpose , we inhibited non - muscle myosin II ATPase ac - tivity in MDDCs using the speciﬁc inhibitor blebbistatin ( Straight et al . , 2003 ) . This inhibition resulted in a dose - dependent in - crease in HIV - 1 transfer , following 2 hr treatment of wild - type MDDCs with the active enantiomer of blebbistatin ( Figures 7A and S7A ) . Inhibiting actomyosin contractility also rescued HIV - 1 transfer from MDDCs in which TSPAN7 or DNM2 had been knocked down or that were subsequently treated with CK666 or dynasore ( Figures 7A and S7A ) . We observed a very strong correlation ( Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient = 0 . 94 ) between the level of inhibition of HIV - 1 transfer due to disruption of actin nucleation and the ability of blebbistatin to rescue and increase HIV - 1 transfer ( Figure S7B ) . Of note , treatment of T cells alone with either blebbistatin enantiomer had no effect on their infec - tion with HIV - 1 ( Figure S7C ) . The blebbistatin - mediated increase or rescue of HIV - 1 transfer waslinked toan impressiveincreaseorrestoration in formationof ﬁlopodiaandactin - richdendrites ( Figure7B , leftandmiddle ) . This was accompanied by increased or restored localization of HIV - 1 on actin - rich dendrites ( quantiﬁed in Figure 7C ) . Inhibition of DNM2 function did not prevent the increase in ﬁlopodia and ‘‘extended’’ actin - rich dendrites , but it limited the maintenance of HIV - 1 on the ‘‘extended’’ dendrites ( Figure 7B , right , and Fig - ure 7C ) . By comparison , although inhibition of macropinocytosis with rottlerin attenuated HIV - 1 internalization in multiple condi - tions ( scramble , TSPAN7 , or DNM2 shRNA knockdown ) , it did notenhanceactinnucleationandformationofactin - richdendrites ( Figures 7B and 7C ) . Finally , active blebbistatin reduced the mac - ropinocytosis - dependent HIV - 1 and dextran internalization following TSPAN7 or DNM2 knockdown ( Figures 7D and S7D ) . In conclusion , inhibition of actomyosin contraction compen - sates for defective actin nucleation and cortical actin stability in MDDCs and thus facilitates HIV - 1 localization on extracellular dendrites and concomitant viral transfer to T cells . DISCUSSION Although the phenomenon of trans - enhancement has been known for over two decades , studies to date have mainly focused on which DC receptors are involved and whether virions are internalized prior to being handed off to T cells . Actin - rich sheet - like membrane extensions dependent on Cdc42 were pre - viously described as critical for HIV - 1 transfer in immature MDDCs ( Nikolic et al . , 2011 ) . Using a robust quantitative genetic screen , we were able to identify , with high conﬁdence , that actin nucleation and an intact cortical actin cytoskeleton are required to maintain HIV - 1 association with dendrites and prevent engulf - ment of virus into macropinocytic vesicles . These results rein - force the growing consensus that HIV - 1 is transmitted directly from the cell surface , rather than through an obligate endocytic pathway ( Cavrois et al . , 2008 ; Do et al . , 2014 ; Yu et al . , 2008 ) . TSPAN7 and Regulation of Actin Nucleation Tetraspanin family members are involved in multiple aspects of cell biology and physiology , including cell motility , signaling , morphology , neurite outgrowth , viral entry , and tumorigenesis ( Charrin et al . , 2014 ) . In cultured hippocampal neurons , TSPAN7 is required for ﬁlopodia and dendritic spine formation and stabi - lization , a role that is consistent with the subcellular phenotypes associated with the characterized X - linked mental retardation pathology , due to mutations in TSPAN7 ( Bassani et al . , 2012 ; Zemni et al . , 2000 ) . Even though TSPAN7 expression is not as high in MDDCs as in brain , its expression was induced during monocyte to DC differentiation and correlated with the formation of dendrites . We found that inhibitors of the ARP2 / 3 complex phenocopied the TSPAN7 knockdown in MDDCs . As dendritic spine formation is dependent on actin nucleation , a role for TSPAN7 in regulating the actin cytoskeleton was proposed . Accordingly , the C - terminal tail of TSPAN7 binds the PDZ domain of PICK1 ( Bassani et al . , 2012 ) , a molecule that interacts with ARP2 / 3 and F - actin ﬁlaments to inhibit actin nucleation ( Rocca et al . , 2008 ) . Thus , in DCs , TSPAN7 may sequester PICK1 to prevent its inhibition of ARP2 / 3 . Another mode of action of TSPAN7 could be through interactions with phosphatidylino - sitol 4 - kinase ( PI4K ) ( Yauch and Hemler , 2000 ) and b 1 - integrin ( Bassani et al . , 2012 ; Berditchevski , 2001 ) , which regulate the actin cytoskeleton through biosynthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate and recruitment of ARP2 / 3 complex - interact - ing proteins to the vicinity of plasma membrane phosphoinositi - des ( Berditchevski , 2001 ; Hilpela¨ et al . , 2004 ) . DNM2 and Regulation of Cortical Actin DNM2 is a large GTPase , which can self - assemble into higher - or - der structurestopromote endocytosis bystimulating the ﬁssionof budding vesicles upon GTP hydrolysis ( Doherty and McMahon , Figure 6 .

DNM2 is also recognized as a regulator of the actin network and has been found co - local - izing with actin - rich structures such as podosomes , actin comet tails , phagocytic cups , dynamic cortical rufﬂes , and lamellipodia ( Ferguson and De Camilli , 2012 ; Gu et al . , 2010 ) . Within lamellipo - dia , DNM2 regulates the spatiotemporal distribution of a - actinin and cortactin , actin - binding proteins that inﬂuence the actin network ( Menon et al . , 2014 ) . DNM2 also binds directly to F - actin ﬁlaments and aligns them into bundles and participates in the elongationofactin ﬁlamentsbyreleasing theactin capping protein gelsolin ( Gu et al . , 2010 ) . Interestingly , it has been reported that DNM2 - depleted cells retain their capacity to form membrane pro - trusions even though there is a reduction in the dense network of branchedcorticalactin ( Menon etal . , 2014 ) . Thisisconsistentwith our observation that , in MDDCs , there was retention of actin - rich dendrites despite the loss of a continuous barrier of cortical actin upon knockdown of DNM2 . Regulation of HIV - 1 Internalization by Macropinocytosis Our results show that , in MDDCs , extension of membrane pro - trusions and endocytosis are tightly linked and inversely corre - lated , based on their dependency on actin nucleation and cortical actin . Upon disruption of the cortical actin ﬁlament network , we observed a selective increase in macropinocyto - sis - mediated solute uptake and sequestration of HIV - 1 particles in large intracellular vesicles , also enriched for MHC class II . Tar - geting of this pathway may thus improve presentation of HIV an - tigens to T cells , restricting viral dissemination . The cortical actin network creates tension that inhibits endo - cytosis ( Gauthier et al . , 2012 ; Kaur et al . , 2014 ) , and debranching and subsequent actin remodeling and / or depolymerization are required for membrane bending and vesicle morphogenesis dur - ing endocytosis ( Martin et al . , 2006 ) . Our results in MDDCs are consistent with such a role . A form of macropinocytosis that in - volves blebs , which are largely devoid of branched and polymer - ized actin , has been described for vaccinia virus , whose internal - ization has been linked to bleb retraction ( Mercer and Helenius , 2008 ) . TSPAN7 knockdown or CK666 treatment induced a switch from actin - rich protrusions to blebs . By inhibiting bleb for - mation using blebbistatin we demonstrated that increased inter - nalization of HIV - 1 occurs through bleb retraction , following disruption of actin nucleation . Treatment of MDDCs with bleb - bistatin also led to a marked increase in an ‘‘extended’’ network of actin - rich dendrites that were adorned with HIV - 1 particles in a context of intact actin nucleation ( Figure S7E ) . The concomitant increase in HIV - 1 transfer reinforces the importance of viral main - tenance on actin - rich dendrites in this process . Bleb formation , which is driven by actomyosin contraction ( Ridley , 2011 ) , is antagonized in a dynamic and ﬁnely regulated manner by Arp2 / 3 activity that controls the cellular actin cortex and cortical tension ( Bergert et al . , 2012 ) . Growth cone collapse , which occurs in the absence of protrusive forces derived from actin nucleation , can be rescued by inhibition of contractile forces ( actomyosin ) produced by nonmuscle myosin II ( Yang et al . , 2012 ) . Our data suggest that the same mechanism is uti - lized during formation of actin - rich dendrites in immature MDDCs ( Figure S7E ) . Results with DNM2 knockdown , which reduced HIV - 1 transfer and was reversed by inhibition of macro - pinocytosis , suggest that DNM2 functions independently of the ARP2 / 3 complex to control cortical actin stability ( Figure S7E ) . Dendritic Cell Function in HIV Pathogenesis DCs are likely the ﬁrst cells to encounter and capture HIV - 1 dur - ing viral transmission . By localizing to the surface of actin - rich ﬁ - lopodia - like structures , HIV - 1 may increase its likelihood of encountering CD4 + T cells . By failing to efﬁciently replicate in DCs , HIV - 1 has the potential to avoid innate immune detection ( Manel et al . , 2010 ) and instead exploit DCs to rapidly and efﬁ - ciently infect CD4 + T cells through trans - enhancement . Such a model was recently supported by in vivo evidence for a contribu - tion of trans - infection to retroviral spread in humanized mice ( Sewald et al . , 2015 ) . Our genetic approach is a ﬁrst step toward a better understanding of the molecular and cell biological as - pects of HIV - 1 transmission between DCs and T lymphocytes , which is needed to evaluate the importance of this process in an - imal models and , eventually , in infected individuals . The genes identiﬁed in this study may thus serve as targets for limiting early HIV - 1 transfer and propagation . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Transduction and shRNA Screen Blood monocytes were plated at 1 3 10 5 cells per well in 100 m l medium with cytokines ( humanGM - CSF andhumanIL - 4 ) andweretransducedwith50 m lof SIVmac VLP / Vpx ( Mangeot et al . , 2002 ) in the presence of 5 m g / ml polybrene and 50 m l ( 10 7 IU / ml ) viral supernatant containing each shRNA from a human vesicular and membrane trafﬁcking library ( Broad Institute [ SIGMA ] ; Moffat et al . , 2006 ) . Approximately 50 , 000 transduced MDDCs were recovered per well after 4 days of differentiation and were used for transfer experiments in co - cultureswithautologousTcellsandX4 - HIV - 1GFP . SeealsoSupplemental Experimental Procedures . trans - enhancement and Flow Cytometry Analysis After 4 days of stimulation with human GM - CSF ( 50 ng / ml ) and human IL - 4 ( 10 ng / ml ) , 50 , 000 MDDCs ( 1 million / ml ) were mixed with 50 , 000 ( 1 million / ml ) autologous CD4 + T cells ( activated for 4 days in the presence of phytohe - magglutinin A [ PHA - L2 m g / ml ] + IL - 2 [ 10IU / ml ] ) and 150 m lX4 - tropic HIV - 1 en - coding GFP ( 50 ngp24 GAG , quantiﬁed by ELISA ) per wellin 96 - well round - bot - tom plates .
