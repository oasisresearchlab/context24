Here , we report the real - time visuali - zation of these structures in living cells reliably tracked by rapid , three - dimensional imaging with the use of a spinning - disk confocal microscope . We imaged relatively sparse , diffraction - limited , ﬂuores - cent objects containing chimeric ﬂuorescent protein ( clathrin light chain , s adaptor subunits , or dyna - min2 ) with a spatial precision of up to (cid:1) 30 nm and a temporal resolution of (cid:1) 1 s . The dynamic charac - teristics of the intracellular clathrin / AP1 and cla - thrin / AP3 carriers are similar to those of endocytic clathrin / AP2 pits and vesicles ; the clathrin / AP1 coats are , on average , slightly shorter - lived than their AP2 and AP3 counterparts . We conﬁrmed that although dynamin2 is recruited as a burst to clathrin / AP2 pits immediately before their budding from the plasma membrane , we found no evidence supporting a similar association of dynamin2 with clathrin / AP1 or clathrin / AP3 carriers at any stage during their life - time . We found no effects of chemical inhibitors of dynamin function or the K44A dominant - negative mutant of dynamin on AP1 and AP3 dynamics . This observation suggests that an alternative budding mechanism , yet to be discovered , is responsible for the scission step of clathrin / AP1 and clathrin / AP3 carriers . INTRODUCTION Clathrin - based carriers are responsible for a large fraction of the endocytic trafﬁc between the plasma membrane and endo - somes , for trafﬁc between endosomes , and for trafﬁc between endosomes and the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) . Protein compo - nents of the clathrin coat selectively recruit cargo into the carrier . Assembly of the coat drives membrane engulfment into a clathrin - coated pit , which pinches off as a coated vesicle . Clathrin - coated pits and vesicles are diffraction - limited objects with typical diameters ranging between 75 and 130 nm . The smaller (cid:1) 75 nm coats contain at least 36 copies of clathrin , a heterohexameric protein of three heavy chains and three light chains , and about half that number of copies of the heterotetra - meric AP adaptor complex ( Kirchhausen , 2000 ) ; the larger coats , which are more abundant , contain proportionally more clathrin and APs . Intracellular clathrin - coated vesicles contain AP1 or AP3 adaptors ; endocytic clathrin - coated vesicles contain AP2 ( Kirchhausen , 1999 ; Robinson and Bonifacino , 2001 ) . The assembly of the endocytic clathrin - based carriers can be fol - lowed by expression of clathrin light chains or the s 2 subunit of AP2 fused with enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein ( EGFP ) or related ﬂuorescent proteins ; suitably designed chimeric proteins do not affect the functional properties of the labeled carriers ( Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ) . Thus , the dynamics of AP2 - contain - ing clathrin - coated structures at the surface of a cell attached to a glass coverslip have been studied by two - dimensional ( 2D ) time - lapse imaging , using confocal or total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence microscopy ( Cocucci et al . , 2012 ; Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ; Merriﬁeld et al . , 2005 ; Mettlen et al . , 2009 ; Saffarian et al . , 2009 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ; Yarar et al . , 2005 ) . Results from these experiments have shown that clathrin and AP2 adaptors are recruited continuously during coat formation and that the average lifetime of endocytic coats is 40 – 60 s . Efforts to follow AP1 - containing intracellular carriers have been less successful ( Waguri et al . , 2003 ) , however , because the rapid three - dimensional ( 3D ) movement of endosomes has not permitted one to distinguish initiation of assembly or dissoci - ation of their coat from passage into or out of the imaging plane . No data are available for AP3 . We have circumvented these problems by using a 3D tracking method that yields accurate results for relatively weak ﬂuorescent objects that vary in position and intensity from image to image . The approach , which is simple to apply , uses data from 3D time series recorded with a spinning - disk confocal microscope from cells stably express - ing s 1 - EGFP or s 3 - EGFP . It reveals previously undetected Cell Reports 2 , 1 – 9 , November 29 , 2012 ª 2012 The Authors 1 Please cite this article in press as : Kural et al . , Dynamics of Intracellular Clathrin / AP1 - and Clathrin / AP3 - Containing Carriers , Cell Reports ( 2012 ) , http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . celrep . 2012 . 09 . 025 properties of AP1 - and AP3 - containing carriers in mammalian cells . We ﬁnd conclusive evidence for colocalization of AP - 3 and clathrin in intracellular carriers . We also ﬁnd that intracellular , AP - 1 - containing clathrin carriers are on average slightly shorter - lived than intracellular clathrin / AP3 and endocytic clathrin / AP2 carriers . The large GTPase , dynamin , drives the ﬁnal pinching - off of a clathrin - coated membrane vesicle from a fully constricted coated pit ( Hinshaw , 2000 ; Macia et al . , 2006 ; Mettlen et al . , 2009 ; Praefcke and McMahon , 2004 ; Sever et al . , 2000 ; Urrutia et al . , 1997 ) . At the plasma membrane , this step requires acute recruitment of dynamin immediately following completion of cla - thrin / AP2 coat assembly ( Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ; Merriﬁeld et al . , 2002 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) , detected as a burst of ﬂuorescence from dynamin2 - EGFP just after the ﬂuorescence from tagged clathrin has reached its maximum ( Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ; Lee et al . , 2006 ; Massol et al . , 2006 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . Dynamin activity is also necessary at an earlier stage in endocytic - coated pit assembly : blocking dynamin with the small - molecule inhib - itor , Dynasore ( Kirchhausen et al . , 2008 ; Macia et al . , 2006 ) , arrests clathrin incorporation before the coat has fully closed , but generally after at least half the clathrin has already accumu - lated ( Macia et al . , 2006 ) , a result conﬁrmed by measurements of the effect of overexpressed mutant dynamin on the maturation of endocytic clathrin - coated pits ( Loerke et al . , 2009 ) . This assembly - arrest function appears to correspond to a steady recruitment of dynamin , at a level generally well below that of the ﬁssion - inducing burst , during the growth of an endocytic clathrin coat ( Macia et al . , 2006 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . We have examined the dynamics of dynamin recruitment and the effects of dynamin inhibition on the AP1 - and AP3 - containing clathrin carriers we can now detect . We ﬁnd no evidence of a detectable burst of dynamin2 - EGFP associated with clathrin / AP1 or clathrin / AP3 carriers at any point in their assembly - disas - sembly cycle , and we conﬁrm this result by immunoﬂuorescence imaging of endogenous dynamin2 . In the same cells , dynamin2 - EGFP exhibits the characteristic recruitment burst at clathrin / AP2 - coated pits at the plasma membrane . Moreover , we ﬁnd no evidence that treating cells with dynasore ( 3 - hydroxy - naphtha - lene - 2 - carboxylic acid ( 3 , 4 - dihydroxy - benzylidene ) - hydrazide ) or with its more active hydroxylated analog , dynasore - OH ( 3 - hydroxy - N 0 - [ ( 2 , 4 , 5 - trihydroxyphenyl ) methylidene ] naphthalene - 2 - carbohydrazide ) or dyngo - 4a ( Harper et al . , 2011 ; Nguyen et al . , 2012 ) , prevents release of AP1 - or AP3 - containing carriers from thetheir donor membranes . These resultsare inline with the absence of effects from overexpressed dominant negative mutant dynamin K44A on the maturation of AP1 - and AP3 - con - taining carriers . These observations , which are also consistent with earlier work that demonstrated lack of functional interfer - ence with trafﬁc along the secretory pathway by overexpression of dominant negative mutant dynamins , suggest that an alterna - tive budding mechanism , yet to be discovered , is responsible for the scission step of clathrin / AP1 and clathrin / AP3 carriers . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 3D Tracking We implemented a method for tracking the 3D position of a diffraction limited object with up to (cid:1) 30 nm precision and for determining the ﬂuorescence intensity associated with its 3D point - spread function . The approach is suitable for 3D time series recorded from living cells with a spinning - disk confocal microscope . It yields accurate results for relatively weak ﬂuores - cent objects that might vary in intensity from image to image . Our tracking routine accepts data as a time series of z stacks , each plane in the stack being a recorded optical section . The required z spacing is approximately one - fourth to one - third of the full height of the point spread function ( PSF ) ; in the examples described here , D z (cid:1) 250 – 450 nm . We detect single ﬂuorescent spots in the maximum projection image of a stack by a three - step procedure : 2D Gaussian and Laplacian ﬁltering , followed by a local maximum - ﬁnding algorithm . The x and y positions of the spots are then obtained in a window of 7 3 7 pixels ( 94 nm per pixel ) by a previously described 2D Gaussian ﬁtting algorithm ( Yildiz et al . , 2003 ) . For each spot , the 7 3 7 pixel window is then extended to each plane in the z stack , and integrated intensities for each plane are calculated by summing the pixel values and subtracting the local background . The background on each plane was determined in an 11 3 11 pixel window around each spot , by taking the average of the lowest - intensity pixel in each row . This average of minima ensures that no signal from a neighboring spot contributes to the calculation . The centroid of the intensity distribution in z was calculated as C z = P ni = 1 z i I i = P ni = 1 I i where n is the number of planes in the z stack , z i is the coordinate of a plane on the z axis , and I i is the integrated signal of that plane . The integrated intensity of the plane with the minimum signal is the threshold subtracted from all planes . To establish the feasibility of the localization method just described , we imaged AP1 adaptors tagged by stable expres - sion in BSC1 cells of the small AP1 subunit , s 1 , fused to EGFP ( Figure 1A ) , rather than beads or other idealized objects . We ﬁrst tested axial localization accuracy in ﬁxed cells for AP1 - carriers ( Figure 1B ) containing 20 – 40 EGFP ﬂuorophores per spot ( Fig - ure S1 ) imaged in a spinning disk confocal microscope equipped with a piezo - driven stage . For a particular position of the stage , we recorded a set of ten independent z stacks ( each stack con - taining seven optical sections at a spacing of 350 nm ; Figure 1B ) . We then displaced the stage ( and hence the cell ) by 100 nm and recorded a second set of z stacks . We repeated the displace - ment three more times , yielding ten seven - plane z stacks for each of ﬁve stage positions . We determined , by the method out - lined above , the z coordinate for the object in each of the ten stacks at different stage positions . The 100 nm steps taken by the stage were resolved with an estimated error of (cid:1) 30 nm ( Fig - ure 1B ) despite the relatively coarse sampling ( the interval between optical sections was 350 nm and the total height of the point - spread function was nearly 1 m m ) ; similar values were obtained using data from four instead of seven optical sections ( red and green tracings , Figure 1B ) . Because the xy translations of our stage were not accurate enough to calibrate the precision by direct translation , we used instead the SD of the centroid determination in x and y , which were < 10 nm , to set an accuracy of (cid:1) 10 nm . We then tested the applicability of the 3D approach in living cells by following the dynamics of an AP1 - containing carrier in BSC1 cells . We recorded z stacks of ﬁve optical planes 2 Cell Reports 2 , 1 – 9 , November 29 , 2012 ª 2012 The Authors Please cite this article in press as : Kural et al . , Dynamics of Intracellular Clathrin / AP1 - and Clathrin / AP3 - Containing Carriers , Cell Reports ( 2012 ) , http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . celrep . 2012 . 09 . 025 separated by 350 nm ( after correction by the axial distortion ) ; the time interval between stacks was 1 s ; each exposure was for 25 ms . The x and y positions ( Figure 1C ) of a diffrac - tion - limited , AP1 - containing object followed for 60 s were determined at each time point from the center of a Gaussian ﬁt to the maximum projected image of the stack . The correspond - ing z position , equivalent to the center of the intensity proﬁle along the z axis , was established by centroid analysis of the integrated intensity of the spot determined in each plane ( Figures 1C and 1D ) . 3D Tracking of AP1 and AP3 Clathrin - Coated Carriers We proceeded to image a large number of intracellular AP1 - or AP3 - containing carriers ( tagged by stable expression of s 1 - EGFP or s 3 - EGFP , respectively ) in a volume deﬁned by a region (cid:1) 1 – 2 m m thick between the dorsal and ventral plasma membrane at the cell periphery or between the ventral surface and the nucleus immediately above it . By using this spatial constraint , we ensured that the carriers were completely tracked during the assembly and disassembly cycle of the coat . Acquisi - tion of interpretable 3D tracings from the perinuclear region containing the TGN was not feasible , however , because the AP1 or AP3 ﬂuorescent spots were so dense that single carriers were not resolvable . This imaging approach overcomes a signif - icant limitation of 2D visualization with wide - ﬁeld or single - plane laser confocal microscopy , in which movement of the carriers along the z axis leads to the possibility that appearance or disap - pearance of the ﬂuorescence signal might be explained by entering or departing the imaging volume , rather than by initia - tion or dissociation of the coat . We conﬁrmed that all ﬂuorescently tagged AP1 - and AP3 - containing structures were within the endosomal and perinuclear Figure 1 . 3D Fluorescence Microscopy Visualization Strategy and Tracking ( A ) Schematic representation of the 3D visualization strategy used to image the intracellular region of a cell .

In addition we conﬁrmed that all AP1 spots colocalized with clathrin ( one representative example shown in Figures 1E and 1F ) and found that AP3 also colocalized with clathrin tagged by transient expression of its light chain LCa fused to tomato ( Figures 2A – 2C and S3 ) . We also established by immunoﬂuores - cence that stable expression of s 3 - EGFP did not affect the extent of colocalization between objects containing AP3 and clathrin identiﬁed with a newly available anti - d adaptin antibody ( Peden et al . , 2004 ) and an antibody speciﬁc for clathrin light chain ( Figures S4A and S4B ) . The nearly complete colocalization of all AP3 spots with clathrin resolves a long - standing contro - versy concerning the extent of their association .

We then measured the lifetimes of intracellular AP1 - and AP3 - containing carriers and compared them with the life - times of endocytic AP2 - containing carriers ( Figures 2D – 2F ) . The average ± SD values for AP1 - , AP2 - , and AP3 - containing carriers were 45 ± 16 s , 53 ± 18 s , and 53 ± 15 s , respectively ( Figure 2E ) . Most clathrin - and AP2 - containing carriers are within 200 nm of the plasma membrane ( Saffarian and Kirchhausen , 2008 ) ( Figure 2G ) , whereas the AP1 - and AP3 - containing carriers are further displaced toward the cell interior ( Figures 1A and 2G ) . By applying this simple geometric categorization , we could differentiate endocytic from intracellular clathrin events occur - ring within the same cell ( Figure 2G ) and hence control for variation due to expression level or extent of replacement of endogenous light chains with ectopically expressed LCa - EGFP . We then compared the ﬁnal sizes of the clathrin coats associated with AP1 and AP3 intracellular carriers with those of coats associated with AP2 ( Figure 2F ) using the maximum ﬂuorescence intensity of the clathrin signal as a measure of size ( Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ; Saffarian et al . , 2009 ) . Both sets of carriers had similar distributions of maximum clathrin ﬂuores - cence intensities , indicating a similar range of sizes for AP1 - , AP2 - , and AP3 - containing carriers . This conclusion agrees with previous measurements from electron microscopy of ﬁxed samples ( Kirchhausen , 2000 ) . Assuming that the molar ratio of clathrin to AP2 or to AP1 in the coated vesicles of these cells is the same as in brain ( (cid:1) 0 . 7 : 1 ) ( Blondeau et al . , 2004 ) , we estimate that like AP2 - coated vesicles , a typical clathrin intracellular carrier contains 30 – 80 AP1 or AP3 adaptors . This range is consistent with the maximum number of s 1 - EGFP or s 3 - EGFP molecules associated with a given ﬂuorescent spot ( Figure S1 ) after a correction by a factor of 2 if one assumes an (cid:1) 50 % replacement of the endogenous s 1 or s 3 subunit with the ectop - ically stably expressed subunits , a replacement value deter - mined for s 2 in AP - 2 in BSC1 cells stably expressing s 2 - EGFP ( Cocucci et al . , 2012 ) . A biochemical conﬁrmation of this analysis by western blot analysis is currently not possible because appro - priate antibodies speciﬁc for s 1 or s 3 are not available . Absence of Detectable Bursts of Dynamin Recruited to Intracellular Clathrin / AP1 - and Clathrin / AP3 - Containing Carriers Mammalian genomes encode three dynamins . Dynamin1 is brain - speciﬁc , dynamin2 is ubiquitously expressed , and dyna - min3 is found in brain , lung , and testis ( Urrutia et al . , 1997 ) . It is well established that dynamin mediates budding of endocytic AP2 / clathrin - coated vesicles from the plasma membrane ( Hinshaw , 2000 ; Macia et al . , 2006 ; Mettlen et al . , 2009 ; Praefcke and McMahon , 2004 ; Sever et al . , 2000 ) . In this process , dynamin drives the ﬁssion of the membrane neck connecting the invaginated pit to the plasma membrane , in a process that requires acute recruitment of dynamin ( Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) around the neck immediately after completion of the clathrin / AP2 coat and prior to its uncoating . Complete assembly of endocytic clathrin / AP2 pits also depends on the steady recruitment of smaller amounts of dynamin during growth of the coat , particularly during later stages of coat formation ( Macia et al . , 2006 ) . Although these properties of dynamin have been thoroughly characterized for endocyticAP2 / clathrin - coated pits , the target - ing of dynamin to intracellular AP1 - and AP3 / clathrin - containing carriers and its possible role in maturation of these carriers remains controversial . Some immunolocalization studies showed targeting of endogenous dynamin to the perinuclear region ( Jones et al . , 1998 ; Maier et al . , 1996 ; van Dam and Stoor - vogel , 2002 ) , whereas other immunoﬂuorescence studies failed to show any signiﬁcant localization of endogenous dynamin with clathrin , AP1 , or TGN markers in the endosome - enriched perinuclear region ( Altschuler et al . , 1998 ; Kasai et al . , 1999 ; Yoon et al . , 1998 ) . Only when dynamin2 was overexpressed could it consistently be found in perinuclear regions , by immuno - ﬂuorescence , by immunoelectron microscopy visualization ( Cao et al . , 1998 ; Damke et al . , 1994 ; Jones et al . , 1998 ; Liu et al . , 2011 ; Nicoziani et al . , 2000 ) , or by live cell imaging ( data not shown ) . Overexpression of dominant negative forms of dynamin have also been used to test its effects of the intracellular trafﬁc in intact cells ; some groups reported no detectable effects ( Altsch - uler et al . , 1998 ; Banting et al . , 1998 ; Damke et al . , 1994 ; Kasai et al . , 1999 ) whereas others reported inhibition ( Bonazzi et al . , 2005 ; Cao et al . , 2000 , 2005 ; Jones et al . , 1998 ; Lauvrak et al . , 2004 ; Nicoziani et al . , 2000 ; van Dam and Stoorvogel , 2002 ) . A more recent report showed that simultaneous elimination of dynamin1 and dynamin2 by gene knockout or by siRNA deple - tion had no effect on the perinuclear intracellular distribution of AP1 , but the effects on the assembly dynamics of clathrin / AP1 carriers were not determined ( Ferguson et al . , 2009 ) . To resolve the uncertainties arising from these various obser - vations , we used immunoﬂuorescence to establish the extent of association of endogenous dynamin2 , visualized in BSC1 cells with an antibody speciﬁc for dynamin2 , with AP1 , AP2 , or AP3 ﬂuorescently labeled by stable expression of s 1 , s 2 , or s 3 - EGFP ( Figure 3 ) . We conﬁrmed that many AP2 - containing structures contained dynamin2 ( 24 ± 4 % ; 1 , 915 AP2 spots , n = 5 cells ) , reﬂecting that the association of dynamin2 with endocytic clathrin / AP2 pits , at low levels during coat assembly , and as an acute burst immediately before coated pit budding ( Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ; Macia et al . , 2006 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . In contrast , only a very small fraction of the AP1 or AP3 ﬂuorescent spots ( 4 ± 1 % and 5 ± 2 % ; n = 1 , 639 AP1 spots , n = 5 cells and 871 AP3 spots , n = 4 cells , respectively ) showed detectable presence of dynamin2 . It is possible that steric hindrance of the dynamin epitope might explain the low level of association of the dynamin anti - body with clathrin / AP1 - or clathrin / AP3 - containing carriers . We ruled out this by live cell imaging experiments carried out with human SK - MEL - 2 cells expressing dynamin2 alone ( hDNM2EN ) or clathrin light chain A and dynamin2 ( hCLTAEN / DNM2EN ) ( Doyon et al . , 2011 ) ( Figure 4 ) . We took advantage that in these recently developed cell lines , there is full replacement of the endogenous untagged dynamin2 with a dynamin2 - EGFP chimera , constitutively expressed at the same level as the native protein ( Doyon et al . , 2011 ) . Expression of this dynamin2 - EGFP has no detectable functional consequences for the cells .

We used live - cell , 3D imaging to compare in the same hCLTAEN / DNM2EN cells the recruitment of dynamin2 to the plasma membrane ( e . g . , to endocytic AP2 / clathrin - containing struc - tures ) with the recruitment of dynamin2 to internal membranes including all intracellular , clathrin - containing structures ( e . g . , those containing AP1 or AP3 ) . We collected time series in a volume (cid:1) 1 . 8 m m thick , starting at the ventral plasma membrane and extending through the intracellular region to the dorsal ( Figures 4A – 4C ) . We conﬁrmed that the 3D imaging approach correctly monitored the behavior of dynamin2 - EGFP by demon - strating that most of the dynamin2 - EGFP ﬂuorescence diffrac - tion - limited spots at the plasma membrane appeared as transient events with rapid kinetics . As expected , the majority of these spots ( (cid:1) 80 % ) colocalized with LCa - cherry , displaying the characteristic burst of dynamin recruitment toward the end of the clathrin growth phase and immediately before the clathrin uncoating step ( Figure 4C ) . Similar dynamin2 - EGFP kinetics were observed at the plasma membrane of hDNM2EN cells , in which dynamin2 - EGFP is the only protein that has replaced its wild - type counterpart , indicating that the dynamin behavior is not inﬂuenced by expression of clathrin light chain LCa - cherry ( not shown ) . In contrast to dynamin activity at the plasma membrane , we detected very few dynamin2 - EGFP ﬂuorescent spots in the intracellular region of the same two types of cells ( Figures 4B and 4D ) ; the few detected spots failed to display the rapid formation and disappearance that would report an acute recruitment to intracellular sites . These live cell - imaging results show that the budding mechanism of intracellular cla - thrin / AP1 - and clathrin / AP3 - containing carriers does not involve a process with dynamics that resemble the acute recruitment of dynamin2 to budding endocytic clathrin / AP2 carriers at the plasma membrane . Our failure to detect dynamin associated with AP1 - or AP3 - containing carriers indicates that no more than a limited amount of dynamin is likely to associate with these structures . It does not Figure 3 . Extent of Colocalization of AP1 , AP2 , or AP3 with Dynamin2 Immunoﬂuorescence of dynamin2 together with EGFP ﬂuorescence imaging of AP1 - , AP2 - , and AP3 - containing carriers in BSC1 cells stably ex - pressing s 1 - EGFP , s 2 - EGFP , or s 3 - EGFP visu - alized in 3D . The ﬁxed samples were stained with an antibody speciﬁc for dynamin2 and imaged in 3D using optical sections spaced 0 . 1 m m .

Scale bar represents 10 m m . rule out a potential parallel for the activity of dynamin that is required to avoid mid - to late - stage assembly arrest of endocytic - coated vesicles ( Macia et al . , 2006 ) , because the associated accumu - lation could have been below the threshold of detection in our experiments . To test this possibility , we examined the effects of inhibiting dy - namin on AP1 and AP3 dynamics , and found that adding 160 m M to cells expressing s 1 - or s 3 - EGFP had no detectable effect on the dynamics of AP1 and AP3 ( Figure 2E ) . Moreover , addition of dynasore - OH , a more potent analog of dynasore , also had no detectable effect on AP1 and AP3 dynamics ( 20 m M dynasore - OH [ Figure 2E ] or 40 m M [ not shown ] ) . As a positive control for the inhibitory endocytic effect of dynasore or dynasore - OH , we established that transferrin uptake in the same cells was completely blocked ( not shown ) , as were AP2 dynamics ( Fig - ure 2E ) . These experiments were complemented by examining AP dynamics in BSC1 cells following transient expression of WT dynamin2 or the dynamin2 mutant K44A 16 hr postviral transduction ( Altschuler et al . , 1998 ) . Under these conditions , expression of the dynamin2 K44A mutant but not WT dynamin2 fully inhibited AP2 dynamics and strongly blocked receptor - mediated endocytosis of transferrin in every cell observed in the ﬁeld ( Figure 2E and data not shown ) . We found no evidence , however , of inhibition of AP1 and AP3 dynamics ( Figure 2E ) even though the uptake of transferrin was also blocked in cells expressing s 1 - or s 3 - EGFP ( data not shown ) . These results are consistent with electron microscopy data showing accumu - lation of incomplete coated structures at the plasma membrane but not in the perinuclear region ( Damke et al . , 1994 ) and are in agreement with absence of defects in clathrin - dependent intra - cellular trafﬁc in cells overexpressing dominant negative forms of dynamin ( Altschuler et al . , 1998 ; Banting et al . , 1998 ; Damke et al . , 1994 ; Kasai et al . , 1999 ) . These observations suggest that dynamin is not used for the scission of AP1 and AP3 carriers and that their budding may be different in mechanism from the budding of AP2 - containing carriers . We have noticed that expression of WT or mutant dynamin2 driven by viral transduction or plasmid transfection decreased the ﬂuorescence intensity of all s - EGFP subunits associated with APs spots , presumably a result of promoter competition . This effect is particularly strong 24 hr posttransfection , a period 6 Cell Reports 2 , 1 – 9 , November 29 , 2012 ª 2012 The Authors Please cite this article in press as : Kural et al . , Dynamics of Intracellular Clathrin / AP1 - and Clathrin / AP3 - Containing Carriers , Cell Reports ( 2012 ) , http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . celrep . 2012 . 09 . 025 required in order to block endocytosis due to the accumulation of sufﬁcient amounts of dynaminK44A , so that it was not possible to detect ﬂuorescent spots containing s 1 , s 2 , or s 3 - EGFP , even though the localization of APs spots detected by immune ﬂuorescence microscopy was not affected ( not shown ) . Conclusions We have used data from 3D time series corresponding to z stacks recorded with a spinning - disk confocal microscope to follow the fate of AP1 - and AP3 - containing intracellular carriers . We have been able to track them from assembly to uncoating , despite their relatively rapid motion in all three dimensions . These structures have lifetimes and sizes ( the latter as estimated from maximum ﬂuorescence intensity ) comparable to those of endocytic , clathrin - coated AP2 / clathrin - containing carriers . We were unable to detect participation of dynamin in AP1 - and AP3 - directed clathrin carrier formation either during coat assembly or at the vesicular pinching off steps . The molecular mediators of membrane ﬁssion for these carriers remain to be determined .

Live Cell Spinning Disk Confocal Imaging Approximately 1 3 10 5 BSC1 or SK - MEL - 2 cells were plated 16 hr prior to imaging on 25 mm in diameter No . 1 . 5 glass coverslips . Imaging medium was phenol red free DMEM supplemented with 10 % FCS and 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 . For imaging , the coverslips were placed on a temperature - controlled 5 % CO 2 humidiﬁed chamber ( 20 / 20 Technologies , Wilmington , NC ) mounted on thepiezo - electricdrivenstageofaMarianaimagingsystem ( IntelligentImaging Innovations , Denver , CO ) basedonanAxiovert200Minvertedmicroscope ( Carl Zeiss , Thornwood , NY ) , a CSU - X1 spinning disk confocal unit ( Yokogawa Electric , Tokyo , Japan ) , a spherical aberration correction device ( SAC , Inﬁnity Photo - Optical , Boulder , CO ) and a 63 3 objective lens ( Plan - Apochromat , NA 1 . 4 , Carl Zeiss ) . The SAC was placed between the oil - based objective lens and thecameratoresolvethesphericalaberrationintroducedby therefractive indexmismatchbetweenlivingcellsandtheglassoptics . Thedataacquiredfor the experiments using the SK - MEL - 2 cells were obtained with a CSU - 22 spinning diskconfocalunit ( Yokogawa Electric ) modiﬁedwithaBorealisillumi - nation system ( Spectral Applied Research , Richmond Hill , Ontario , Canada ) and without SAC correction . Fluorescence images from cells expressing EGFP and RFP chimeras were simultaneously collected on two sides of the same CCD chip by using a dual view unit ( Roper Scientiﬁc ) mounted before the camera and equipped with a 565DCXR dichroic mirror and HQ525 / 40 and HQ620 / 50 ( Chroma ) emission ﬁlters ( Saffarian et al . , 2009 ) . All the data wereacquiredusingSlidebook5 ( IntelligentImagingInnovations , Denver , CO ) . Data Acquisition and Image Analysis Three - dimensional time - lapse movies correspond to z stacks of four to six consecutive optical planes spaced 0 . 25 – 0 . 45 m m after correction by the axial distortion ( equivalent to 0 . 36 – 0 . 64 m m displacement of the stage ) . Axial distor - tion ( elongation ) stemming from the refractive index mismatch between the glass coverslip and the biological sample was corrected by applying an axial correction value of 0 . 7 ( Ferko et al . , 2006 ; Lu et al . , 2009 ) obtained by imaging 15 m m ﬂuorescent polystyrene beads with the spinning disk confocal micro - scopeequippedwiththesphericalaberrationcorrectiondevice . Allzdistances reportedintheﬁgureshavebeencorrectedbytheaxialdistortion . The3Ddata were acquired at a frequency of 0 . 3 – 2 Hz per stack and 20 – 50 ms exposures per frame ; the movies had durations between 120 and 330 s . Slidebook 5 was used to generate a maximum intensity z projection from each time point of the 3D time series . Custom made MATLAB - based algorithms were used to deter - mine the ﬂuorescence intensity of a given diffraction limited spot and their location along the x and y axis ( from the maximum intensity images ) and along the z axis ( from the z stacks ) . Step sizes for the data in Figure 1B were calcu - lated as D z i = z i + 1 (cid:4) z i , where z i is the average position of step number i . The SD of D z i was calculated by error propagation : s 2 D z i = s 2z i + 1 + s 2z i . ThecolocalizationanalysisofAPswithdynamin2wasperformedusingﬁxed BSC1 cells imaged with the spinning disk confocal microscope . Three - dimen - sional images made of z stacks composed of 0 . 1 m m sequential optical sections were restored using constrained iterative deconvolution ( SlideBook 5 ) . Three - dimensional binary masks were then created by segmentation for both ﬂuorescence channels ( APs and dynamin2 ) , and overlapping regions were determined using the AND operator between the two masks . Each over - lapping region was counted as a colocalization event .

Data are from a time - series acquired every 750 ms using 700 ms exposures . The ﬂuorescence amplitude of the step was used to calibrate the ﬂuorescence intensity associated with a single molecule of EGFP . The relative ﬂuorescence intensity for a single EGFP molecule ( 4301 ± 1134 ; N = 94 ) followed the Gaussian distribution expected for single ﬂuorophores ( not shown ) .

The ﬂuorescence intensities were obtained from the maximum intensity projection extracted from a 3D stack of 15 optical sections spaced 200 nm , each obtained with 700 ms exposure . The number of EGFP molecules associatedwithagivenAP1 ( blue ) orAP3 ( green ) spotwascalculatedbycomparingtheirﬂuorescenceintensitywiththeaveragerelativeﬂuorescenceintensityof a single EGFP determined in ( A ) using the same imaging conditions . The number of s 1 - or s 3 - EGFP molecules associated with diffraction limited intracellular AP1 - or AP3 - containing carriers were 25 ± 13 ( N = 325 ) and 22 ± 11 ( N = 323 ) , respectively .

Extent of Colocalization of AP3 and Clathrin Determined by Live Cell Imaging , Related to Figures 2 and S4 The extent of colocalization of intracellular AP3 and clathrin was determined using spinning disk confocal microscopy of live BSC1 cells stably expressing s 3 - EGFP ( to label AP3 ) and transiently expressing clathrin light chain A – tomato ( to label clathrin ) . Time - series from a single optical section were simultaneously acquired for both ﬂuorophores from split images obtained every 1 . 5 s using a Dual View device placed in front of the camera with 25 ms exposures .

While almost all AP3 spots colocalized with clathrin , only a fraction of clathrin colocalized with AP3 ; this is the expected result given that intracellular clathrin carriers containing AP3 do not contain AP1 or AP2 .
