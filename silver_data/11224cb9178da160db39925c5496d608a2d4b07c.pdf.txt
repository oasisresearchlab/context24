Cover Received : 8 May 2016 ; Accepted : 15 June 2016 ; Published : 18 June 2016 Abstract : Vacuolating cytotoxin A ( VacA ) is a secreted pore - forming toxin and one of the major virulence factors of Helicobacter pylori ( H . pylori ) , which actively supports the persistence and survival of the bacteria in the special ecological niche of the human stomach . H . pylori genomes harbor different allelic forms of the vacA gene , which translate into functionally distinct VacA toxin types . VacA internalizes into various cell types via membrane or speciﬁc receptor interactions ﬁnally forming acidic endocytic VacA - containing vacuoles ( VCVs ) . In this review , we focus on different characteristics of VacA , its interaction with host cells , the formation and protein content of VCVs and their intracellular transport into human T cells , which ﬁnally leads to the immunosuppressive phenotype of VacA . Immunomodulatory activities of VacA on human T cells are discussed with a focus on T - cell proliferation and calcium signaling . Keywords : cell vacuolation ; VacA channel ; protein - protein interaction ; apoptosis ; IL - 2 secretion ; proliferation inhibition ; vesicle transport 1 . Introduction The human bacterial pathogen Helicobacter pylori ( H . pylori ) , ﬁrst cultured and identiﬁed in 1982 , still infects more than 50 % of the world’s population [ 1 ] . H . pylori contributes to the development of diseases such as gastritis , duodenal and gastric ulcers , and gastric cancer , earning it a place on the WHO list of class 1 carcinogens , even though only a minority of infected individuals develop clinical symptoms [ 2 ] . It holds an impressive inventory of virulence factors , which enable the bacteria to persist in the human stomach and cause lifelong infections . Among these , the vacuolating cytotoxin A ( VacA ) displays an impressive list of abilities [ 3 ] . VacA has been termed a paradigm for toxin multifunctionality [ 3 ] . Research on VacA over the last quarter of a century reveals the impressive association of this toxin with many different cell types , affecting membrane structure and function , the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , the mitochondria , and the Golgi apparatus , seemingly causing a plethora of cellular effects , including the concurrent suppression and stimulation of immune cells among other things [ 4 , 5 ] . Its main deﬁning feature is the formation of large acidic intracellular vacuoles [ 6 ] . This review will brieﬂy outline VacA’s composition and some of its effects before delving further into the possible intracellular movements of the VacA - containing vacuoles ( VCVs ) and their effects on human T cells , especially its immunomodulatory potential . 2 . The Production of Functionally Distinct VacA Toxin Types by H . pylori The vacA gene codes for a signaling sequence , the p33 , p55 , and autotransporter domains and translates into a 140 - kDa protoxin [ 3 , 4 , 7 ] . Mosaicism of this gene has been found to inﬂuence the Toxins 2016 , 8 , 190 ; doi : 10 . 3390 / toxins8060190 www . mdpi . com / journal / toxins Toxins 2016 , 8 , 190 2 of 10 toxicity , namely variations in the signal sequence ( s1a - c , s2 ) , the intermediate region ( i1 , i2 ) , and the mid - region ( m1 , m2 ) [ 8 ] . From early on , varying disease probabilities have been linked to the different s and m regions of VacA . Thus , most effective immune regulatory effects and an association with generally more severe disease states have been attributed to an s1 / m1 genotype [ 8 , 9 ] . Gonzalez - Rivera et al . showed that an i1 form of VacA was more adept at inhibiting T - cell function as well as binding better to the target T cells than an i2 form [ 10 ] . Winter et al . discovered a correlation between the presence of the i1 form of VacA and gastric metaplasia in patients , while the i2 form of VacA was associated with an almost complete absence of metaplasia in the stomach of H . pylori - infected individuals [ 11 ] . To become active , the protoxin is processed at the amino - and carboxyl - terminals , yielding a mature 88 - kDa cytotoxin , which is then secreted via a type Va secretion system [ 7 , 12 ] . As VacA is secreted it forms spontaneous hexameric and dodecameric ﬂower - shaped structures [ 13 ] . These oligomers need to be monomerized via acid - activation to be internalized and to fully unfold their potential [ 13 ] . The p33 N - terminal region contains a short residue sequence essential for vacuolating activities [ 14 ] , and the p55 C - terminal region is important for the toxins’ target binding abilities . However , both fragments are needed for internalization and vacuolation [ 15 ] . Near the amino - terminal , there is a short and very hydrophobic segment , whose presence is required for vacuole formation . Bacterial mutants missing a 21 amino acid stretch ( ∆ 6 - 27aa ) of this 32 amino acid region produce a VacA toxin that is incapable of causing vacuolation [ 14 , 16 ] . 3 . The Effects of VacA on Eukaryotic Cells Several distinct effects of the VacA toxin have been described in different cell types in vitro and the gastric epithelium in vivo . The occurrence of vacuolation in cells incubated with H . pylori culture supernatant was the ﬁrst piece of evidence of a secreted toxin being responsible for some of the cellular damage possibly causing ulcers [ 6 , 17 ] . Since that discovery , many more effects have been added to the list of abilities of the vacuolating toxin A . Remarkably , it causes permeabilization of the plasma membrane [ 18 ] , reduction of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential , mitochondrial cytochrome C release [ 19 – 21 ] , mitochondrial fragmentation [ 22 ] , and even cell cycle arrest [ 14 ] . Furthermore , VacA is known to cause cell death via apoptosis [ 23 , 24 ] as well as programmed necrosis [ 25 ] . Initially , VacA was studied exclusively for its effects on epithelial cells , which indeed represent the ﬁrst barrier for VacA in the gastric mucosa . However , it may rapidly pass this initial barrier . Another of H . pylori ’s toxins , the cytotoxin associated antigen A ( CagA ) comes to its aid by associating with the scaffolding protein ZO - 1 in epithelial cells and disrupting their barrier function [ 26 ] , possibly allowing VacA access past the epithelial barrier . Having accessed the lamina propria , it can get into contact with many other cell types , especially cells of the immune system such as granulocytes , macrophages , dendritic cells ( DCs ) , natural killer ( NK ) cells , and B and T cells . There , VacA interacts with DCs to reprogram them towards a tolerogenic phenotype and may efﬁciently inhibit proliferation of T lymphocytes , as shown under in vitro conditions [ 27 , 28 ] . In recent years , VacA research has extended towards its immunomodulatory effects . By migration of lymphocytes , monocytes , and granulocytes to the inﬂamed area in the gastric submucosa , the ﬁght of H . pylori for survival and persistence begins . This can , unfortunately , worsen the disease state , as the adaptive immune response is known for its collateral damage by the production of cytokines from effector cells [ 29 ] . Due to H . pylori ’s long co - evolution with humans , VacA was able to adapt to host defence mechanisms , allowing H . pylori to survive and thrive despite the presence of an acquired immune response . H . pylori ’s effect on the host immune response , as a whole , is unconventional , as it shows both signs of being anti - inﬂammatory and pro - inﬂammatory . On the one hand , it inhibits B - and T - lymphocyte activation by various means ; on the other , it induces mast cell migration and the production of pro - inﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines [ 4 , 30 ] . Infection stimulates a humoral response with the production of IgA and IgG antibodies against various H . pylori antigens , also against VacA . Although these latter antibodies may interfere with the vacuolating activity , antibodies in general do not seem to faze the bacteria much , as suggested by their presence in chronically infected patients [ 31 ] . Toxins 2016 , 8 , 190 3 of 10 4 . VacA—T Cell Interaction , Internalization , and Formation of Acidic Vacuoles It is known that in order to exert its many effects , VacA must be internalized via endocytosis . VacA – target binding has been associated with the larger p55 subunit , but it has also been shown that both the p33 and the p55 subunits are required for internalization [ 15 ] . Since the formation of vacuoles is largely dependent on VacA acid - activation , it is assumed that VacA needs to join with the membrane in a monomeric form before internalization [ 32 ] . However , the vacuolating effect of this toxin is dependent on oligomerized VacA , as elegantly demonstrated by Vinion - Dubiel et al . ( 1999 ) , showing that the addition of a mutant toxin prevented vacuole formation in a dominant negative fashion . Interestingly , the pore formation was inhibited by the mutant VacA ( non - vacuolating ) , which oligomerized with the wild - type VacA , forming non - functional pores , and hence prevented swelling and vacuolation [ 14 ] . To internalize , VacA must bind to the cell , and various receptors have been shown to bind to VacA among different cell types [ 33 – 35 ] . In human T cells , the deciding binding receptor is the integrin β 2 subunit , CD18 , as identiﬁed by Sewald et al . in 2008 . Ricci et al . has already described that vacuolating activity was interrupted when lipid rafts were disabled in a membrane via a cholesterol - sequestering agent [ 36 ] . This highlighted the important role of cholesterol - rich lipid rafts for a productive interaction of VacA with the target cell membrane . Furthermore , the important plasma membrane sphingolipid sphingomyelin ( SM ) was identiﬁed to be essential for VacA toxin binding to the plasma membrane . Taking this information together with the fact that the internalization was dependent on certain members of the protein kinase C ( PKC ) family , Sewald et al . suggested a working model for the internalization of VacA into human T cells [ 37 ] . This model suggests that VacA endocytosis is achieved by VacA’s binding as a monomer to sphingomyelin , resulting in its recruitment to the uropod of the T - cell trailing edge , where it then binds to the integrin β 2 subunit CD18 , which is associated with lipid rafts in activated T cells . Here , the integrin heterodimer ( CD18 and CD11a ) and the Leukocyte function - associated antigen 1 ( LFA - 1 ) oligomerizes , leading to the phosphorylation of Thr 758 of CD18’s cytoplasmic domain by PKC η or PKC ζ . As a consequence , calpain removes talin from the CD18 cytoplasmic tail , allowing the adaptor protein 14 - 3 - 3 to bind to phosphorylated Thr 758 , which subsequently initiates the activation and recruitment of small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac - 1 to enable actin rearrangements that lead to the endocytosis of VacA into the cell [ 37 , 38 ] . During or after endocytosis , VacA molecules oligomerize to form anion - selective channels that facilitate the inﬂux of chloride ions , which leads to the swelling of the endosome . For these channels to form , the aforementioned hydrophobic region near the amino - terminal is essential [ 32 ] , as shown by the inability of a mutant lacking this region , VacA ∆ 6 - 27 , to form vacuoles [ 14 ] . These vacuoles show VacA in their membranes as well as in their interior [ 5 , 37 ] . Shortly after infection , these vacuoles also contain markers pertaining to early and late endosomes , Rab - 5 and Rab - 7 , respectively , and LAMP - 1 colocalization , a marker for lysosomes [ 37 ] , even though VacA escapes lysosomal degradation [ 39 ] . At 24 h after infection , the vacuoles show only the late endo / lysosomal markers Rab - 7 and LAMP - 1 , suggesting maturation from early to late endosomes [ 37 , 40 ] . As the endosomes swell forming VCVs , they need to recruit further membrane material to enable expansion without bursting . The origin of this material is still of some debate , but it was demonstrated that the VCVs co - localize with the SNARE protein syntaxin - 7 , which is involved in intracellular membrane fusions , suggesting that the vacuoles integrate other endosomes , lysosomes , or both upon vacuolation , enabling them to grow in size [ 41 ] . However , the VCVs apparently do not associate with the recycling endosomes , as indicated by the lack of VacA interaction with Rab - 11 [ 37 ] . 5 . VCV Intracellular Transport , Toxin – Host Protein Interaction , and the Targeting of Cellular Organelles The VCV mode of transport is still poorly understood , but it is known that they acquire an actin tail and use this to propel themselves around the cell cytoplasm [ 42 ] . It has long been implicated that VacA reaches mitochondria causing measurable effects [ 21 , 43 ] and has more recently been seen to co - localize with the ER and the Golgi [ 5 ] . It enters the cell in an endocytic vesicle that matures into Toxins 2016 , 8 , 190 4 of 10 a late endosome - like VacA - containing vacuole ( VCV ) . Lysosome – endosome hybrids usually travel to the Golgi apparatus , where their content is redistributed around the cell in Golgi vesicles via the Trans Golgi Network ( TGN ) . Since the VCVs seem to co - localize with the Golgi , VacA might contact the Golgi in this way . Thereby , VacA possibly uses various transport methods to get to its desired locations ( Figure 1 ) .

Thereby , VacA possibly uses various transport methods to get to its desired locations ( Figure 1 ) . Figure 1 . VCV intracellular transport , the toxin – host protein interaction , and the targeting of cellular organelles . VacA interacts with the host cell membrane binds to a cellular receptor and associates with lipid rafts . As a consequence , VacA enters into the membrane and oligomerizes to form anion ‐ selective channels . Next , the VacA ‐ receptor complex is endocytosed and matures from early via late endosomes into acidic vacuoles to form VacA ‐ containing vacuoles ( VCVs ) . The V ‐ ATPase acidifies the endosomal compartment , resulting in the uptake of weak bases ( NH 3 ) and H 2 O . The VacA channel supports the entry of Cl − ions , resulting in their swelling . VacA then might contact the Golgi apparatus either as a VCV or by entering the cytosol to bind to and pass the mitochondrial membranes by a yet unknown mechanism . Furthermore , VacA seems to also make contact with the ER . VacA not only travels within the cell’s cytoplasm itself , it can also alter vesicular trafficking in cells [ 44 – 46 ] and can alter the protein content of endocytic compartments [ 40 ] . Recently , the contents of these VCVs were precisely analyzed to give an insight into their function [ 5 ] . VCVs were shown to contain 122 VCV ‐ specific proteins coming from various cellular compartments , including 24 . 5 % that are usually located at the nucleus , 12 . 3 % in the mitochondria , 11 % at the ER , and even 4 . 9 % in the Golgi [ 5 ] . These proteins also had a wide range of functions , among which the signaling proteins made up a large part ; however , interestingly , 14 . 7 % of the proteins found were involved in vesicle trafficking . VacA was successfully identified to co ‐ localize with the ER via fluorescence microscopy and via Western blotting and mass spectrometric analysis of the VCV ( Figure 1 ) [ 5 ] . Interestingly , this study also identified lysosomal membrane proteins as well as ER markers , including membrane and luminal proteins , mitochondrial markers including inner membrane proteins , and Golgi markers , including membrane lipid anchors and vesicle proteins to be VCV ‐ specific . Colocalization of VacA with the ER was demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy and validated by Western blotting and MS data . VCVs also contained the protein ITPR3 , a calcium channel in the ER and STIM1 , a calcium sensor in the ER ( Figure 2 ) . Interestingly , the calcium sensing , channeling , and signaling in the ER are very important for the activation of T cells in vitro and in vivo , and their presence in the VCV along with the fact that VacA inhibits T ‐ cell activation is remarkable .

Figure 2 . VacA interferes with T ‐ cell activation and proliferation by manipulating the T ‐ cell receptor pathway and the cell cycle . Upon the stimulation of T cells via TCR and CD28 , two major pathways are activated ( the Ca 2 + ‐ dependent pathway and the MAP ‐ kinase and NFkB pathway ) . The anion ‐ selective channel activity of VacA is thought to depolarize the plasma membrane and to prevent the opening of the CRAC calcium channel , either directly or via the blocking of the ER ‐ located Ca 2 + sensor STIM1 , which is operated by calcium released from intracellular stores . Alternatively , VacA might also block calcineurin activation directly . This might result in abrogation of transcription of IL ‐ 2 and IL ‐ 2R α genes . At low doses , VacA inhibits T ‐ cell activation by inducing a cascade of phosphorylation events involving a still unidentified receptor , Vav , and MKK3 / 6 , resulting in an increase of the active form of p38 . Vav induces actin rearrangement through the small GTPase Rac , which leads to inhibition of T ‐ cell proliferation .

Cellular Immune Response and Immunoregulatory Activities of VacA in Human T Cells Very little is known about the immune response to H . pylori in an acute infection setting , as most patients are asymptomatic and infection often occurs in early childhood . However , chronic infection can be readily investigated [ 47 ] . Naïve CD4 + T cells can be differentiated into T helper 1 ( Th1 ) , Th2 , Th17 , and T regulatory ( Treg ) phenotypes , depending on the cytokine milieu with which they are confronted . Th1 cells can produce interleukin ‐ 2 ( IL ‐ 2 ) and interferon ‐ gamma ( IFN ‐γ ) and aid in cell ‐ mediated immune responses , whereas Th2 cells can produce IL ‐ 4 and aid B cells to activate and differentiate . The only recently identified Th17 cells are often involved in host defence mechanisms involving extracellular bacteria . Tregs , on the other hand , are capable of suppressing these effector T cells in their cytokine production and proliferation and therefore act as a crucial part of the immune response to pathogens and regulating inflammation to prevent host damage [ 47 ] . In contrast , increased numbers of Tregs have been associated with peptic ulceration and gastric adenocarcinoma [ 48 ] .

Cellular Immune Response and Immunoregulatory Activities of VacA in Human T Cells Very little is known about the immune response to H . pylori in an acute infection setting , as most patients are asymptomatic and infection often occurs in early childhood .

The only recently identiﬁed Th17 cells are often involved in host defence mechanisms involving extracellular bacteria . Tregs , on the other hand , are capable of suppressing these effector T cells in their cytokine production and proliferation and therefore act as a crucial part of the immune response to pathogens and regulating inﬂammation to prevent host damage [ 47 ] . In contrast , increased numbers of Tregs have been associated with peptic ulceration and gastric adenocarcinoma [ 48 ] . Thus , the ability of VacA to regulate the expression of Foxp3 , a regulator of Tregs , and miR - 155 was discovered [ 48 ] . In another study , Tregs marked as CD4 + / CD25 high , were isolated from H . pylori - infected patients and were shown to induce memory T - cell suppression when added to memory cell assays [ 49 ] . ( Further details on the VacA immunoregulatory activities pertaining to Tregs can be found in the accompanying review by Djekic and Müller ) . In the same study , the authors showed that this unresponsiveness is limited to H . pylori - speciﬁc memory cells , as there was no marked decrease in the response of memory cells to tetanus toxoid . However , in their setup , the addition of IL - 2 was able to overcome the suppression . The H . pylori T cells response is largely made up of Th1 and Th17 T helper cells [ 30 ] . As Th1 cells are producers of IFN - γ , a major risk factor in the development of gastritis , and IL - 2 , which is important for T - cell proliferation and hence bacterial clearance , a Th1 response usually increases gastritis severity and leads to lower colonization densities [ 30 ] . In vaccine studies in mice , successful vaccinations resulted in a shift from a Th1 to a Th2 response . A general increase in the Th1 response results in a stronger H . pylori - induced gastritis [ 50 ] . Curiously , vaccine - induced protection in IL - 4 deﬁcient mice suggests that a Th2 - derived response is not needed for protection [ 51 ] . In humans , VacA shows mainly immunosuppressive tendencies towards T cells , it can inhibit IL - 2 production and T - cell activation [ 9 , 27 , 28 ] and , in conjunction with the gammaglutamyl - transferase ( GGT ) , promotes persistence and immune tolerance [ 52 ] . The VCV content strongly suggests an interaction of VacA , or VCVs , with many parts of the T - cell activation system as well as with other immune response molecules . A major effect of VacA on T cells is the inhibition of their proliferation , but also the suppression of IL - 2 production and secretion . Several independent groups reported that VacA tested in vivo caused a marked decrease in IL - 2 secretion in the human Jurkat T - cell line , which was artiﬁcially stimulated by phorbol myristate acetate ( PMA ) [ 9 , 27 , 28 ] . Two of these groups also demonstrated the effects of VacA on IL - 2 production of primary human CD4 + T cells and found that it was relatively unchanged if the T cells were activated by anti - CD3 and anti - CD28 antibody activation ( CD3 / CD28 activation ) . Interestingly , IL - 2 secretion of primary T cells treated with VacA was unchanged upon CD3 / CD28 activation , but was markedly reduced upon PMA activation . This indicates that the inhibitory effect was downstream of the PMA activation pathway , which can be overridden by a TCR CD3 / CD28 activation [ 28 ] . PMA induces NF κ B via PKC θ to activate IL - 2 transcription . The CD3 / CD28 activation signaling utilizes many routes ; in addition to signaling via PKC θ , it can also induce IL - 2 production via IP3 , causing a subsequent intracellular Ca 2 + increase , which in turn activates NFAT transcription of the IL - 2 gene , or it can even promote transcription via the AP - 1 activator protein via diacylglycerol ( DAG ) signaling towards the Erk – MAPK – Jun / Fos pathway ( Figure 2 ) . In vivo , the T cells would be activated via their TCRs ; hence , the CD3 / CD28 activation is the more natural activation . The decrease in proliferation of primary human T cells or peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBLCs ) treated with VacA is still very apparent [ 9 , 27 , 28 ] . IL - 2 is needed as a proliferation stimulant by T cells , and evidence suggests that IL - 2 secretion is relatively unchanged ( in primary human CD4 + cells via CD3 / CD28 activation ) [ 28 ] . Surprisingly , proliferation is reduced despite IL - 2 supplementation of the media , suggesting that the possible lack of IL - 2 , due to suppressive effects , was not the proliferation limiting factor [ 27 , 28 ] . It is implicated that T - cell proliferation inhibition is caused by inducing a cell cycle arrest in T lymphocytes [ 27 , 28 ] , achieved by downregulating the cyclin D3 and E and consequently strongly reducing the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein ( Rb ) , the downstream target of those cyclins [ 27 ] . It was demonstrated that proliferation was inhibited even if Toxins 2016 , 8 , 190 7 of 10 VacA was added 48 h after activating the cells , suggesting that VacA’s effect on proliferation is not through the inhibition of activation [ 28 ] . In 2007 , Torres et al . demonstrated that VacA inhibits the proliferation of T cells that are stimulated by PMA / ionomycin or by CD3 / CD28 activation , and of B cells stimulated either by PMA / anti - IgM or by T cells . This effect was evident in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells . The study went on to show that the proliferation of CD4 + T cells was also inhibited when the cells were activated by superantigens on antigen presenting cells ( APCs ) [ 53 ] . VacA suppresses the IL - 2 production by various means . One of which is by interfering with the calcium signaling pathway at the level of the calcium - calmodulin - dependent phosphatase calcineurin [ 27 ] , thereby preventing the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) and resulting in the downregulation of transcription of the IL - 2 gene ( Figure 2 ) . Interestingly , VCVs contained IP3R and were associated with STIM1 , both of which are involved in calcium signaling in the ER , but also identiﬁed some PKCs needed for T - cell activation and IL - 2 production as well as PI3 kinase ( PI3K ) , another T - cell activation factor . Thus , the VCV content strongly suggests an intensive interaction of VacA , with many components of the T - cell activation system as well as with other immune response molecules ( Figure 2 ) . 7 . Concluding Remarks We have learned much about the structure and function of the vacuolating toxin of H . pylori over the last quarter of a century . We know about several components of the host cell membrane that are targeted for VacA internalization , and we know about some of the players involved in the endocytosis process . We have recently learned that VacA - containing vacuoles ( VCVs ) formed after VacA uptake into T lymphocytes are considerably complex membrane and protein assemblies that seem to target several host cell organelles when VacA travels through the host cell cytoplasm . However , we still do not understand the major strategies very well , how VacA induces its major immunomodulatory activities , neither in antigen presenting cells nor in T cells . Calcineurin was identiﬁed earlier as a major intracellular target of VacA , but we know that many more targets of the calcium signaling cascade of the T cells seem to be interaction partners of VacA in VCVs and therefore within the scope of VacA . In the future , we hope to sort out which of the VacA interaction partners are of relevance for the immunoregulatory activities of this fascinating bacterial toxin .
