A MAP Kinase - Signaling Pathway Mediates Neurite Outgrowth on L1 and Requires Src - Dependent Endocytosis Ralf - Steffen Schmid , Wendy M . Pruitt , and Patricia F . Maness Department of Biochemistry , School of Medicine , University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill , North Carolina 27599 - 7260 The neural cell adhesion molecule L1 mediates the axon out - growth , adhesion , and fasciculation necessary for proper devel - opment of synaptic connections . Mutations of human L1 cause an X - linked mental retardation syndrome termed CRASH ( corpus callosum hypoplasia , retardation , aphasia , spastic paraplegia , and hydrocephalus ) , and L1 knock - out mice display defects in neuro - nal process extension resembling the CRASH phenotype . Little is known about the biochemical or cellular mechanism by which L1 performs neuronal functions . Here it is demonstrated that clustering of L1 with antibodies or L1 protein in rodent B35 neuroblastoma and cerebellar neuron cultures induced the phosphorylation / activation of the mitogen - activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) and extracellular signal - regulated kinases 1 and 2 . MAPK activation was essential for L1 - dependent neurite outgrowth , because chemical inhibitors [ 2 - ( 2 9 - amino - 3 9 - methoxyphenyl ) - oxanaphthalen - 4 - one and 1 , 4 - diamino - 2 , 3 - dicyano - 1 , 4 - bis ( 2 - aminophenylthio ) butadiene ] of the MAPK ki - nase MEK strongly suppressed neurite outgrowth by cerebellar neurons on L1 . The nonreceptor tyrosine kinase pp60 c - src was required for L1 - triggered MAPK phosphorylation , as shown in src - minus cerebellar neurons and by expression of the kinase - inactive mutant Src ( K295M ) in B35 neuroblastoma cells . Phos - phatidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3 - kinase ) and the small GTPase p21 rac were identiﬁed as signaling intermediates to MAPK by phosphoinositide and Rac – GTP assays and expression of in - hibitory mutants . Antibody - induced endocytosis of L1 , visual - ized by immunoﬂuorescence staining and confocal microscopy of B35 cells , was blocked by expression of kinase - inactive Src ( K295M ) and dominant - negative dynamin ( K44A ) but not by inhibitors of MEK or PI3 - kinase . Dynamin ( K44A ) also inhibited L1 antibody - triggered MAPK phosphorylation . This study sup - ports a model in which pp60 c - src regulates dynamin - mediated endocytosis of L1 as an essential step in MAPK - dependent neurite outgrowth on an L1 substrate . Key words : neurite outgrowth ; endocytosis ; neural cell adhe - sion molecule ; signal transduction ; Src ; MAP kinase ; PI3 - kinase The cell adhesion molecule L1 functions broadly in regulating the growth of axons in developing neurons and in fostering learning in the adult brain ( Persohn and Schachner , 1990 ; Scholey et al . , 1993 ; Luthi et al . , 1994 ) . L1 is localized in the plasmalemma of growth cones and processes of developing neurons , on axons of mature nonmyelinated neurons , and in Schwann cells , astrocytes , and some hematopoietic cells ( for review , see Schmid and Man - ess , 2000 ) . L1 knock - out mice show axon guidance errors in the corticospinal tract ( Cohen et al . , 1997 ) and corpus callosum ( Demyanenko et al . , 1999 ) , misoriented dendrites of cortical pyramidal cells ( Demyanenko et al . , 1999 ) , degeneration of sen - sory axons ( Haney et al . , 1999 ) , and enlarged ventricles ( Dahme et al . , 1997 ; Demyanenko et al . , 1999 ) . Many of these features are present in humans with the X - linked mental retardation syn - drome termed CRASH ( corpus callosum hypoplasia , retardation , aphasia , spastic paraplegia , and hydrocephalus ) , resulting from L1 gene mutations ( Fransen et al . , 1997 ) . Little is known about the mechanism by which L1 directs axonal growth or guidance , but the structural features of L1 suggest that it may differ from that used by other classes of receptors to stimulate neurite outgrowth . The L1 extracellular region mediates homophilic ( L1 – L1 ) and heterophilic binding via its six immunoglobulin - like and ﬁve ﬁbronectin type III domains ( Appel et al . , 1993 ; Zhao et al . , 1998 ) . Its short cytoplasmic region of 110 amino acids lacks a tyrosine kinase domain but contains an actin - interaction domain ( Dahlin - Huppe et al . , 1997 ) , an ankyrin - binding region ( Davis and Bennett , 1994 ) , and a neuronal - speciﬁc sequence , RSLE , which targets L1 to axons ( Kamiguchi and Lemmon , 1998 ) . This motif is also involved in binding adaptor protein 2 , a clathrin adaptor , which enables L1 to be internalized in growth cones via receptor - mediated endocytosis ( Kamiguchi et al . , 1998 ) . It is not known whether endocytosis of L1 plays any role in the biological functions of L1 or merely directs L1 to intracellular pathways for degradation . A requirement for the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase pp60 c - src in L1 - mediated neurite outgrowth has been identiﬁed in src - minus neurons ( Ignelzi et al . , 1994 ) , but how pp60 c - src regulates neurite growth on L1 is not known . pp60 c - src is tethered by N - terminal myristylation to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane and interacts functionally with a variety of receptor types ( Man - ess et al . , 1996 ) . On the basis of the recent ﬁnding that pp60 c - src is required for endocytosis and signaling of the b - adrenergic receptor ( Ahn et al . , 1999 ) , we have investigated the hypothesis that pp60 c - src regulates the internalization of L1 as a critical determinant of L1 - mediated neurite outgrowth . Like the b - adrenergic receptor , L1 clustering activates mitogen - activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) in neuronal cells ( Schmid et al . , 1997 ; Schaefer et al . , 1999 ) , but it is not known whether MAPK has a Received Feb . 1 , 2000 ; revised March 15 , 2000 ; accepted March 17 , 2000 .

L1 triggering also modulates intracellular levels of phosphoi - nositides , pH , and Ca 2 1 ( Schuch et al . , 1989 ; von Bohlen und Halbach et al . , 1992 ) and activates tyrosine phosphatases in growth cones ( Atashi et al . , 1992 ; Klinz et al . , 1995 ) , suggesting that an array of signaling intermediates may coordinate the com - plex intracellular program that allows growth cones to navigate through the developing brain and form synaptic connections . Here we demonstrate that MAPK activation triggered by L1 in neuronal cells is required for neurite outgrowth on L1 and is mediated via pp60 c - src and the small GTPase p21 rac and phospha - tidylinositol 3 - kinase ( PI3 - kinase ) . Furthermore , it is shown that pp60 c - src functions by controlling dynamin - mediated endocytosis of L1 as an essential step in MAPK activation . This L1 pathway has the potential to regulate both actin cytoskeletal dynamics in growth cones and gene expression in the nucleus , events that may coordinate to regulate the growth and navigation of neuronal processes . MATERIALS AND METHODS Antibodies and plasmids .

Morrison , National Cancer Institute , Fred - erick , MD ) ; and HA - tagged ERK2 ( Melanie Cobb , University of Texas Southwestern Medical School , Dallas , TX ) . Other plasmids used encoded enhanced cyan ﬂuorescence protein ( Invitrogen , San Diego , CA ) and glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) plasmids encoding the c - Jun ( 1 – 79 ) – GST fusion protein ( Shelton Earp , University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill , NC ) and the Rac - binding domain ( RBD ) – GST fusion protein ( Richard Cerione , Cornell University , Ithaca , NY ) . Cell cultures and methods of L1 clustering . To produce a cell line stably expressing human L1 ( with RSLE ) , we transfected rat B35 neuroblas - toma cells ( Schubert et al . , 1974 ) with human neuronal L1 cDNA in the pcDNA3 vector ( gift of John Hemperly , Becton Dickinson ) . After selec - tion in 0 . 5 mg / ml G418 , 17 clones were assayed for L1 expression by Western blotting , and L1 localization on the cell surface was veriﬁed by indirect immunoﬂuorescence staining with Neuro4 antibodies . One clone ( designated B35 - L1 ) exhibiting intermediate levels of L1 expression was chosen for the studies reported here . B35 - L1 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ; HyClone , Logan , UT ) and G418 ( 0 . 25 mg / ml ) . Primary cultures of mouse cerebellar neurons were prepared from postnatal day 8 Sv129 / C6B57 hybrid mice by the method of Schnitzer and Schachner ( 1981 ) and grown in DMEM with 10 % FBS ( HyClone ) , 25 m M KCl , and penicillin / streptomycin . The medium was replaced with OptiMEM ( Life Technologies , Gaithersburg , MD ) , and cells were incubated for 8 hr before initiating signaling . For clustering of L1 on B35 - L1 cells and cerebellar neurons , L1 monoclonal antibody Neuro4 ( 30 m g ) or L1 – Fc fusion proteins ( 50 m g ) were prein - cubated with F ( ab 9 ) 2 fragments of secondary antibodies raised against Fc fragments of mouse or human IgG for 1 hr at 4°C in 50 m l of OptiMEM . The complexes were added directly to cells in a 60 mm dish containing 1 ml of medium at 37°C . Clustering of L1 into patches on the cell surface was observed by indirect immunoﬂuorescence staining ( data not shown ) . MAPK phosphorylation assays . Cells were stimulated with the indi - cated L1 antibodies or fusion proteins , rinsed once with cold HBSS , and extracted in Nonidet P - 40 ( NP - 40 ) lysis buffer containing 1 % NP - 40 , 0 . 25 % ( w / v ) Na - deoxycholate , 50 m M HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 137 m M NaCl , 1 m M Na - EDTA , 10 m M NaF , 1 m M Na - orthovanadate , 10 m M p - nitrophenylphosphate , 1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride , 10 m M b - glycerophosphate , 10 m g / ml leupeptin , 0 . 1 TIU / ml aprotinin , 1 m g / ml pepstatin , 2 n M calyculin A , and 10 % ( v / v ) glycerol . Lysates were clariﬁed by centrifugation at 14 , 000 3 g for 20 min at 4°C . Protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) . Proteins in cell extracts were separated by SDS - PAGE and trans - ferred to a nitrocellulose membrane . The membrane was blocked for 2 hr in 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) in Tris - buffered saline containing 0 . 05 % Tween 20 ( TTBS ) and then incubated overnight at 4°C either with anti - active MAPK antibodies or p38 MAPK antibodies in 1 % BSA in TTBS . After washing in TTBS , the membrane was incubated with goat anti - rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate in TTBS for 1 hr . The membrane was again washed in TTBS , and immune complexes were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence ( ECL ; NEN ) with Sterling x - ray ﬁlm ( BioWorld ) . Membranes were stripped and reprobed in the same manner with ERK antibodies to detect total ERK protein . For assaying phosphorylation of HA - tagged ERK2 , B35 - L1 cells were transfected for transient expression with an HA - tagged ERK2 plasmid with or without plasmids expressing dominant - negative mutants . Subcon - ﬂuent cultures were transfected in 60 mm dishes containing OptiMEM using Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( Life Technologies ) . Signaling experiments were initiated 36 – 40 hr after transfection . Cells were lysed in NP - 40 lysis buffer , and HA - tagged ERK2 was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts ( 500 m g ) with anti - HA antibody ( Babco ) for 1 . 5 hr , followed by Protein G - Sepharose for 0 . 5 hr at 4°C . Immune complexes were washed in lysis buffer and subjected to SDS - PAGE , followed by immunoblotting with anti - active MAPK anti - body . For all assays , the exposed bands on x - ray ﬁlm were quantitated by densitometric scanning and analysis with Image - Quant NT software . MEK inhibitors [ 2 - ( 2 9 - amino - 3 9 - methoxyphenyl ) - oxanaphthalen - 4 - one ( PD98059 ; 50 m M ; New England Biolabs ) and 1 , 4 - diamino - 2 , 3 - dicyano - 1 , 4 - bis ( 2 - aminophenylthio ) butadiene ( U0126 ; 10 m M ; Promega ) ] or a PI3 - kinase inhibitor [ Ly294002 ( 10 – 20 m g ; Promega ) ] dissolved in di - methylsulfoxide ( DMSO ; , 0 . 01 % ) was added to cells for 1 hr before signal initiation . The Rho inhibitor C3 botulinum endotoxin ( 20 m g ) was added with Lipofectamine ( 5 m g ) to cells for 4 hr before stimulation . Control cultures received the same concentration of DMSO or Lipofectamine . For assaying the activity of c - Jun N - terminal kinase ( JNK ) , cell extracts ( 100 m g of protein ) in NP - 40 lysis buffer were incubated with c - Jun ( 1 – 79 ) – GST fusion protein for 4 hr at 4°C . Immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer ( 25 m M HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 25 m M MgCl 2 , 25 m M b - glycerophosphate , 2 m M dithiothreitol , 0 . 1 m M Na - orthovanadate , and 2 m M p - nitrophenyl - phosphate ) and then incubated in kinase buffer with 50 m M ATP and 0 . 5 m Ci of [ g 32 P ] ATP ( ICN ) at 30°C for 30 min . Proteins were separated on SDS - PAGE . The dried gel was exposed to x - ray ﬁlm , and exposed bands were quantitated by densitometric scanning and analysis with Image - Quant NT software . Assay of phosphoinositides . PI3 - kinase activity was assayed by immu - noprecipitating phosphotyrosine - modiﬁed PI3 - kinase from cell extracts with phosphotyrosine antibodies and measuring the production of phos - phoinositides from phosphatidylinositol in an immune complex kinase assay ( Myers et al . , 1993 ) . Cell extracts ( 800 m g ) were incubated with phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 for 8 hr at 4°C and then for 1 hr with Protein G - Sepharose . Immunoprecipitates were collected and washed twice with buffers I , II , and III ( buffer I , 20 m M Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 150 m M NaCl , 1 % NP - 40 , and 100 m M Na - orthovanadate ; buffer II , 100 m M Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 500 m M LiCl , and 100 m M Na - orthovanadate ; and buffer III , 10 m M Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 100 m M NaCl , and 100 m M Na - orthovanadate ) . Phos - phatidylinositol ( 0 . 5 mg / ml ; Avanti Polarlipids ) was sonicated in 20 m M Tris , pH 7 . 4 , and 1 m M Na - EGTA and incubated with the immune complexes for 10 min at room temperature in kinase reaction buffer ( total volume of 50 m l ) containing 20 m M ATP , 1 m Ci of [ g 32 P ] ATP ( 3000 Ci / mmol ) , 10 m M MgCl 2 , 20 m M Tris , pH 7 . 4 , and 100 m M NaCl . The reaction was terminating by adding 6N HCl ( 15 m l ) and 1 : 1 ( v / v ) chlo - roform : methanol ( 120 m l ) . Samples were vortexed for 30 sec and centri - fuged at 10 , 000 3 g for 1 min . Aliquots ( 30 m l ) of the chloroform phase were spotted on SilicaG60 plates ( Whatman , Maidstone , UK ) and sub - jected to thin - layer chromatography in chloroform : methanol : 25 % ( w / w ) NH 4 OH : water ( 60 : 47 : 2 : 11 . 3 , v / v / v / v ) . Commercially available phospha - tidylinositol 4 - phosphate ( PIP ; Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) was used to indicate the location of the product . The plate was dried and exposed to 4178 J .

Phospholipids were visualized by incubating the thin - layer plate with iodine vapors , and radioactive spots were scraped from the plate and quantitated for 32 P incorporation in a scintillation counter . Assays for GTP - bound p21 rac and Raf kinase activity . For measure - ment of activated , GTP - bound Rac ( Bagrodia et al . , 1998 ) , B35 - L1 cells were stimulated with L1 antibodies or normal IgG as described ; then lysates ( 500 m g ) were incubated for 30 min at 4°C with 20 m g of a puriﬁed GST fusion protein ( RBD – GST ) consisting of the Rac - binding domain of PAK1 together with glutathione Sepharose . RBD – GST binds only to the activated form of Rac ( Rac – GTP ) but not to inactive Rac – GDP . RBD – GST / Rac – GTP complexes were collected by centrifugation and analyzed by SDS - PAGE and Western blotting with anti - Rac antibodies ( Transduction Laboratories , Lexington , KY ) . To assay Raf activation , we subjected lysates in NP - 40 lysis buffer ( 800 m g ) to immunoprecipitation using polyclonal antibodies speciﬁc for c - Raf or B - Raf ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) and Protein G - Sepharose . In a coupled assay measuring myelin basic protein ( MBP ) phosphorylation ( Upstate Biotechnology , Lake Placid , NY ) , Raf immune complexes were preincubated with inactive MEK and MAPK for 30 min at 37°C and then with MBP and [ g 32 P ] ATP for 10 min at 37°C . MBP was adsorbed to Whatman P81 paper and quantitated for incorporation of radioactivity by scintillation counting . An activated form of Raf provided by the manu - facturer was used as a positive control . The amounts of Raf immunopre - cipitated were determined in parallel by immunoblotting with Raf antibodies . Measurement of neurite outgrowth . Cultures of mouse cerebellar neu - rons consisting chieﬂy of granule cells were prepared from postnatal day 7 or 8 pups by the method of Schnitzer and Schachner ( 1981 ) . Immunoafﬁnity - puriﬁed L1 protein from adult mice brain was applied in 10 m l spots onto nitrocellulose - coated plastic coverslips ( 22 3 22 mm 2 ) in 35 mm Petri dishes as described ( Ignelzi et al . , 1994 ) . After blocking with 1 % bovine serum albumin , 2 3 10 6 cerebellar cells were added per coverslip in 2 ml of basal medium with Eagle’s salts ( Life Technologies ) with 10 % heat - inactivated horse serum , 2 . 5 gm / l glucose , and penicillin / streptomycin . No neurons attached to uncoated areas of the nitrocellu - lose . The MEK inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 were dissolved in DMSO and added at the time of plating at 50 or 10 m M ﬁnal concentration , respectively , resulting in a ﬁnal concentration of 0 . 1 % DMSO . Control cultures received the same concentration of DMSO . Cells were ﬁxed after 24 hr with 4 % p - formaldehyde and then mounted on microscope slides . The length of the longest neurite per cell was measured using a microscope - mounted image processor with cursor overlay . Only neurites longer than ; 10 m m and not in contact with other cells were measured . Neuron attachment to L1 was assayed by counting at least 100 cells from 30 or more randomly selected ﬁelds . Data were obtained from three independent experiments . Immunoﬂuorescence staining for endocytosis of L1 . For experiments in which cell surface L1 and endocytosed L1 were differentially labeled in living cells , a modiﬁcation of the method of Kamiguchi et al . ( 1998 ) was used . Rat B35 - L1 neuroblastoma cells ( 20 , 000 cells / well ) were plated in LabTek II chamber slides ( Nunc , Naperville , IL ) coated with poly - D - lysine . After 24 hr , cells were transfected using Lipofectamine with a plasmid encoding enhanced cyan ﬂuorescence protein ( 0 . 15 m g of cDNA ) together with a plasmid expressing one of the following ( 0 . 25 m g of cDNA ) : wild - type c - Src , kinase - inactive Src ( K295M ) , dominant - negative dynamin ( K44A ) , or dominant - negative PI3 - kinase ( D p85 ) . At 24 hr after the start of transfection , cells were incubated for 45 min at 37°C with 25 m g / ml Neuro4 IgG or normal mouse IgG to induce endocytosis . Cells were washed with cold DMEM and then incubated with goat anti - mouse IgG conjugated to rhodamine for 30 min at 4°C to label L1 on the cell surface . The cells were rinsed with HBSS and ﬁxed in 4 % p - formaldehyde for 30 min . After washing cells once with 0 . 1 m M glycine in PBS and twice with PBS , cells were blocked with goat anti - mouse IgG for 1 hr at 4°C . After rinsing once in cold PBS , the cells were again ﬁxed in 4 % p - formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature . Cells were washed once with 0 . 1 m M glycine in PBS and twice with PBS , and the membrane was permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS containing 10 % goat serum for 1 hr at room temperature . Cells were washed once with PBS and incubated with anti - mouse IgG conjugated to ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) for 1 hr to label cytoplasmic L1 . After additional washes , slides were mounted with Vectashield . Cells were viewed in a Zeiss LSM10 confocal laser microscope equipped with an argon laser ( excitation lines of 488 and 514 nm ) resulting in an optical thickness of 0 . 5 m m at the University of North Carolina Microscopy Services Facility , Department of Pathology ( Chapel Hill , NC ; Dr . Bob Bagnell , Director ) . RESULTS L1 clustering activates the MAPK pathway in cerebellar neurons L1 signal transduction was investigated in primary cultures of mouse cerebellar neurons , which express endogenous L1 and are comprised of . 90 % granule cells ( Schnitzer and Schachner , 1981 ) . Signaling by cell adhesion molecules of the Ig superfamily , such as neural cell adhesion molecule ( NCAM ) , integrins , and certain receptor tyrosine kinases , is initiated by the clustering of receptors with multivalent ligands or antibodies ( Heldin , 1995 ) . L1 molecules were clustered on the surface of cerebellar neurons with antibodies against the L1 extracellular domain ; then cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with phospho - speciﬁc MAPK antibodies recognizing a dually phosphorylated / activated form of the extracellular - regulated kinases ERK1 and ERK2 . These MAP kinases are activated by dual phosphorylation of Thr 202 and Tyr 204 ( Crews et al . , 1992 ; Marshall , 1994 ) . L1 cluster - ing in cerebellar neurons stimulated ERK2 dual phosphorylation ﬁvefold , increasing rapidly within 5 – 10 min and then declining to nearly basal levels by 20 min ( Fig . 1 ) . The decline in phosphory - Figure 1 . Clustering of L1 in cerebellar neurons activates ERK2 . A , Top , Cerebellar cultures were incubated with nonimmune mouse IgG ( NIgG ) , monoclonal antibodies against L1 ( Neuro4 ) complexed with F ( ab 9 ) 2 frag - ments of anti - mouse IgG ( L1 Ab ) , or L1 – Fc fusion protein complexed with F ( ab 9 ) 2 fragments of anti - human IgG ( L1 protein ) . Where indicated ( 1 PD ) , cells were treated with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 ( PD ; 25 m M ) . Cell extracts were subjected to SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting with anti - active MAPK antibodies speciﬁc for phosphorylated ERKs ( pERK1 and pERK2 ) . Bottom , The same nitrocellulose ﬁlter was stripped and reblotted with antibodies recognizing phosphorylated and nonphospho - rylated ERK proteins ( ERK1 and ERK2 ) . This experiment was repeated twice with similar results . B , Densitometric quantiﬁcation of the ERK phosphorylation in A is shown in arbitrary units of phosphorylation relative to that of the nonimmune IgG control . Error bars indicate SEs based on three experiments ; an asterisk denotes statistical signiﬁcance ( p , 0 . 05 ) . Schmid et al . • L1 / MAPK Mediates Neurite Growth by Src - Regulated Endocytosis J . Neurosci . , June 1 , 2000 , 20 ( 11 ) : 4177 – 4188 4179 lation could be caused by activation of a dual speciﬁcity tyrosine / threonine phosphatase such as MAPK phosphatase ( MKP - 1 ) ( Fuller et al . , 1997 ) or L1 - triggered phosphatase activities present in a subcellular fraction enriched in growth cone membranes ( Klinz et al . , 1995 ) . L1 clustering did not induce phosphorylation of ERK1 in the cerebellar neuron cultures even though similar levels of ERK1 and ERK2 were indicated by immunoblotting with antibodies against ERK1 and ERK2 protein ( Fig . 1 A ) . Nonim - mune IgG complexes had no effect on ERK phosphorylation . Multivalent L1 protein , consisting of the L1 extracellular region fused to the Fc portion of human IgG , also stimulated the phosphorylation of ERK2 approximately four - to ﬁvefold in cer - ebellar neurons with kinetics similar to that induced by L1 anti - body complexes ( Fig . 1 ) . ERK2 phosphorylation in cerebellar neurons induced by cross - linked L1 antibodies or L1 – Fc protein was effectively inhibited by the inhibitor PD98059 , which is spe - ciﬁc for MEK ( MAP kinase kinase ) ( Fig . 1 ) . PD98059 binds the inactive form of MEK1 and to a lesser extent MEK2 , preventing the MEK activation required for MAPK phosphorylation ( Alessi et al . , 1995 ) . An intact MAPK pathway is required for neurite outgrowth on L1 To determine whether the MAPK pathway participated in L1 - directed neurite outgrowth , primary cultures of mouse cerebellar neurons ( postnatal day 7 – 8 ) were analyzed for neurite outgrowth on puriﬁed mouse L1 protein adsorbed to nitrocellulose - coated dishes as described previously ( Ignelzi et al . , 1994 ) . L1 - stimulated neurite outgrowth was inhibited by the MEK inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 ( Fig . 2 , Table 1 ) . Mean neurite length decreased 56 % in the presence of PD98059 and 66 % with U0126 ( Fig . 2 ) . U0126 was slightly more effective than PD98059 , probably because U0126 inhibits active and inactive forms of MEK ( Favata et al . , 1998 ) . The residual neurite outgrowth observed in the presence of MEK inhibitors suggested that there may be both MAPK - dependent and - independent pathways for neurite growth on L1 . Neither PD98059 nor U0126 affected cerebellar neuron attach - ment to puriﬁed L1 protein ( Table 1 ; Cells / mm 2 ) , the ability of cerebellar neurons to initiate neurite growth ( Table 1 ; Cells with neurites / mm 2 ; % cells with neurites ) , or the morphology of the neurons . Cells did not adhere to or extend neurites on areas of the nitrocellulose - coated dishes without L1 protein . Effects on fasciculation could not be evaluated in these sparsely plated cultures . These results reveal a functional role for the MEK – MAPK pathway in L1 - dependent neurite outgrowth by cerebellar neurons . L1 activates ERK1 and ERK2 in B35 - L1 neuroblastoma cells The rat neuroblastoma cell line B35 ( Schubert et al . , 1974 ) is a useful CNS model for investigating signaling pathways of neural cell adhesion molecules ( Schmid et al . , 1999 ) . The B35 cell line displays differentiated neuronal properties such as membrane excitability and expression of enzymes for neurotransmitter me - tabolism ( Schubert et al . , 1974 ) and is more easily transfected than primary neurons . B35 cells express little or no L1 as detected by immunoblotting and immunoﬂuorescence staining with L1 antibodies . To deﬁne the L1 - signaling pathway for MAPK acti - vation further , a B35 cell line was generated that stably expressed the RSLE - containing neuronal isoform of L1 ( B35 - L1 cells ) . L1 molecules were clustered on the surface of B35 - L1 cells with L1 antibody complexes ; then cell lysates were analyzed for dual phosphorylation of endogenous MAPKs by immunoblotting with phospho - speciﬁc MAPK antibodies . Phosphorylation of both ERK1 and ERK2 increased four - to ﬁvefold within 10 min of L1 clustering , whereas nonimmune IgG had no effect ( Fig . 3 A , B ) . Phosphorylation was rapid and transient with similar kinetics for ERK1 and ERK2 . Clustering of L1 on the cell surface was necessary for MAPK activation , because monovalent Fab frag - ments of L1 antibodies did not induce ERK phosphorylation ( data not shown ) . The ability of L1 to stimulate phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 in B35 - L1 cells , in contrast to the phosphor - ylation of only ERK1 in cerebellar neurons , suggested that these pathways were differentially regulated . Similar results were ob - tained during NCAM stimulation in cerebellar neurons and B35 cells expressing NCAM140 ( Schmid et al . , 1999 ) . Selective acti - vation of ERK2 and not ERK1 in neuronal cells also occurs during stimulation of protein kinase C or NMDA receptors ( English and Sweatt , 1996 ) . Differential MAPK regulation was characterized previously in yeast in which mating and pseudohy - phal differentiation are independently controlled by the MAPKs Fus3 and Kss1 ( Madhani et al . , 1997 ) . To address the speciﬁcity of L1 activation of the MAPK - signaling pathway , B35 - L1 cells were assayed for L1 - dependent phosphorylation of the MAP kinases , JNK , and p38 , which are activated in response to multiple cellular stressors ( Waskiewicz and Cooper , 1995 ) . No increase of JNK phosphorylation was observed within 5 – 20 min of L1 clustering , whereas sorbitol - treated cells as a positive control showed prominent JNK activity ( Fig . 3 C ) . Similarly , the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was not increased over basal levels compared with anisomycin - treated cells as positive controls ( Fig . 3 D ) . L1 activates the MAPK pathway via PI3 - kinase and Rac To investigate whether L1 clustering activated PI3 - kinase in L1 antibody - triggered B35 - L1 cells , the production of phosphoi - nositides by PI3 - kinase was quantitatively determined . During activation , PI3 - kinase becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine and can be immunoprecipitated with phosphotyrosine antibodies . In - cubation of immune complexes from L1 antibody - stimulated B35 - L1 cells with phosphatidylinositol and [ g 32 P ] ATP produced radiolabeled phosphatidylinositol 3 - phosphate , which was sepa - Figure 2 . Effect of MEK inhibitors on L1 - dependent neurite outgrowth by cerebellar neurons . Mouse cerebellar neurons were plated on puriﬁed L1 protein adsorbed to nitrocellulose - coated coverslips and allowed to extend neurites for 24 hr without or with MEK inhibitors ( 50 m M PD98059 or 10 m M U0126 ) . Cells were ﬁxed , neurite lengths were mea - sured , and results were plotted in a neurite length distribution curve . Two hundred or more cells were analyzed for each condition ( see Table 1 for additional data ) . This experiment was repeated twice with similar results . 4180 J . Neurosci . , June 1 , 2000 , 20 ( 11 ) : 4177 – 4188 Schmid et al . • L1 / MAPK Mediates Neurite Growth by Src - Regulated Endocytosis rated from reactants by thin - layer chromatography ( Fig . 4 A ) . The amount of activated PI3 - kinase increased two - to threefold within 3 – 8 min after antibody triggering . A similar extent of increase in PI3 - kinase activity occurs in cells treated with epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) , platelet - derived growth factor , or phorbol esters and is effective in mediating their physiological functions ( Con - ricode , 1995 ; Nave et al . , 1996 ; Cross et al . , 1997 ) . To determine whether PI3 - kinase was involved in regulating L1 - triggered ERK phosphorylation , a dominant - negative PI3 - kinase mutant ( D p85 ) was cotransfected with HA – ERK2 for transient expression in B35 - L1 cells . This dominant inhibitory mutant contains a deletion in the PI3 - kinase regulatory subunit ( p85 ) that abolishes its binding to the catalytic subunit ( p110 ) ( Hara et al . , 1994 ) . Stim - ulation of B35 - L1 cells expressing this mutant with L1 antibodies resulted in complete inhibition of ERK2 phosphorylation ( Fig . 4 B ) . Treatment of B35 - L1 cells with 10 m M Ly294002 , a selective chemical inhibitor of PI3 - kinase ( Vlahos et al . , 1994 ) , prevented L1 antibody - induced phosphorylation of endogenous ERK1 and ERK2 ( Fig . 4 D ) . Rac and Cdc42 are members of the Rho family of small GTPases that regulate actin cytoskeletal dynamics ( Ridley et al . , 1992 ) , signal to JNK ( Vojtek and Cooper , 1995 ) , and cause cross - cascade activation of the ERK pathway ( Frost et al . , 1997 ) . PI3 - kinase contributes to the activation of Rac and Cdc42 by providing phosphoinositides that bind the plextrin homology do - main of speciﬁc guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) ( Quilliam et al . , 1995 ) . To investigate the role of small GTPases in L1 - stimulated MAPK activation , B35 - L1 cells were cotrans - fected with HA - tagged ERK2 and dominant - negative Rac1 , Ccd42 , and RhoA plasmids , which act by sequestering respective GEFs . ERK2 phosphorylation in antibody - triggered B35 - L1 cells was effectively blocked by the expression of dominant - negative Rac1 ( 17N ) but not RhoA ( 19N ) or Cdc42 ( 17N ) mutants ( Fig . 4 B ) . C3 botulinum toxin , which inhibits RhoA , B , and C but not Rac or Cdc42 ( Braun et al . , 1989 ; Chrzanowska - Wodnicka and Burridge , 1996 ) , also had no effect on L1 - dependent ERK phos - phorylation ( Fig . 4 D ) . The participation of Rac in L1 signaling was conﬁrmed in an assay that directly measured the production of activated , GDP - bound Rac ( Bagrodia et al . , 1998 ) . Cell lysates from L1 antibody - treated B35 - L1 cells were incubated with puri - ﬁed RBD – GST fusion protein , which selectively binds Rac – GTP and not Rac – GDP . The amount of Rac – GTP pulled down by the RBD – GST complexes was signiﬁcantly increased after L1 stim - ulation of B35 - L1 cells ( Fig . 4 C ) . These results supported a role for Rac in L1 signaling to MAPK . L1 - triggered MAPK activation in B35 - L1 neuroblastoma cells differed from NCAM140 signaling to MAPK in its independence from Ras and the focal adhesion kinase p125 fak . Cotransfection of B35 - L1 cells with HA – ERK2 and a dominant - negative Ras ( 15A ) plasmid , which sequesters Ras – GEFs ( Quilliam et al . , 1994 ) , had no effect on L1 antibody - stimulated ERK phosphorylation , whereas it strongly inhibited MAPK activation by EGF ( Fig . 4 B ) . Expression of a Ras dominant - negative mutant ( Ras17N ) or a competitive N - terminal Raf peptide that binds Ras ( Brtva et al . , 1995 ) also had no effect ( data not shown ) . Under the same conditions , Ras ( 15A ) and Ras ( 17N ) interfered strongly with NCAM140 - dependent MAPK activation in B35 cells ( Schmid et al . , 1999 ) . In a coupled immune complex kinase assay for Raf - induced phosphorylation of MBP ( Fucini et al . , 1999 ) , neither c - Raf nor B - Raf became activated to a signiﬁcant degree ( . 10 % over the normal IgG control ) during L1 antibody stimulation of B35 - L1 cells . Dominant - negative Raf - 1 or B - Raf mutants ( S621A or R89L ) also produced insigniﬁcant inhibition of ERK2 phos - phorylation ( . 1 . 2 - fold ) . Similarly , expression of FRNK ( Schaller et al . , 1993 ; Richard - son and Parsons , 1996 ) or the autophosphorylation site mutant Fak ( Y397F ) ( Schaller et al . , 1994 ) , which are dominant interfer - ing inhibitors of p125 fak , did not affect L1 - triggered HA – ERK2 activation ( Fig . 4 B ) , whereas under the same conditions they inhibited NCAM140 - triggered MAPK activation in B35 cells ( Schmid et al . , 1999 ) . Tyrosine phosphorylation of p125 fak was also not increased after L1 antibody triggering , as assessed by Western blotting with phosphotyrosine antibodies in Fak immu - noprecipitates ( data not shown ) . pp60 c - src mediates ERK phosphorylation induced by L1 Because neuronal process extension on puriﬁed L1 is regulated by the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase pp60 c - src ( Ignelzi et al . , 1994 ) , we investigated whether pp60 c - src played a role in MAPK activa - tion triggered by L1 . B35 - L1 neuroblastoma cells were cotrans - fected with HA – ERK2 and the dominant - negative c - Src ( K295M ) plasmid , which expresses a kinase - inactive form of pp60 c - src be - cause of mutation of an essential lysine residue ( K295 ) in the ATP binding site ( Twamley - Stein et al . , 1993 ) . Expression of the dominant - negative src plasmid inhibited ERK2 phosphorylation by ; 70 % in B35 - L1 neuroblastoma cells treated with L1 antibod - ies ( Fig . 5 A ) . Moreover , endogenous ERK2 phosphorylation in cerebellar neurons from src - minus mice was 60 % lower than that in wild - type neurons ( Fig . 5 B ) . The residual ERK2 phosphoryla - tion in src - minus neurons and B35 - L1 cells expressing dominant - negative Src suggested that there may an additional L1 pathway that is pp60 c - src independent , in accord with the incomplete inhibition of L1 - dependent neurite outgrowth in MEK - inhibited cells and by src - minus neurons ( Ignelzi et al . , 1994 ) . L1 did not form a stable complex with pp60 c - src , because L1 and pp60 c - src did not coimmunoprecipitate from Brij97 - detergent extracts of B35 - L1 cells with or without L1 clustering ( data not shown ) under the same conditions in which NCAM140 coimmunoprecipitated with the Src family kinase p59 fyn ( Beggs et al . , 1997 ) .

Neurosci . , June 1 , 2000 , 20 ( 11 ) : 4177 – 4188 4181 pp60 c - src is required for dynamin - mediated endocytosis of L1 L1 has been shown to be endocytosed at the growth cone by a clathrin - mediated mechanism ( Kamiguchi et al . , 1998 ) . To deter - mine whether L1 endocytosis was mediated by pp60 c - src , B35 - L1 cells were analyzed for L1 endocytosis by double immunoﬂuo - rescence staining to visualize internalized and surface L1 with different ﬂuorochromes . Cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild - type Src , kinase - inactive Src ( K295M ) , or dominant - negative dynamin ( K44A ) together with a plasmid ex - pressing cyan ﬂuorescent protein to identify transfected cells . To induce internalization of L1 , we incubated living cells for 30 min at 37°C with the monoclonal antibody Neuro4 , which is directed against an extracellular epitope of L1 . Cells were ﬁxed and stained for L1 on the cell surface with rhodamine - conjugated secondary antibodies . Cells were then permeabilized and stained for internalized L1 with FITC - conjugated secondary antibodies . Confocal microscopy revealed strong FITC labeling of internal - ized L1 antibody complexes in a punctuate , vesicular pattern throughout the cytosol both in cyan - positive cells ( Fig . 6 , arrows , arrowheads ) expressing wild - type Src from a transfected plasmid ( Fig . 6 A , E ) and in nontransfected cells expressing endogenous Src ( Fig . 6 D , H ) . This observation suggested that the amount of endogenous pp60 c - src was not rate - limiting for endocytosis of L1 antibody complexes in B35 - L1 cells . In striking contrast , cyan - positive cells ( Fig . 6 , arrows , arrowheads ) in cultures transfected with dominant - negative Src ( K95M ) showed little L1 endocytosis ( Fig . 6 B , F , C , G ) , whereas cyan - negative cells serving as nontrans - fected controls within the same cultures exhibited prominent vesicular staining in the cytosol . Rhodamine staining for L1 on the cell surface appeared relatively unaltered by endocytosis , suggesting that the amount of internalized L1 was a relatively small portion of the total L1 expressed in B35 - L1 cells . L1 endocytosis was not inhibited in B35 - L1 cells treated with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 ( 50 m M ) ( Fig . 6 J , N ) , in cells expressing PI3 - kinase D p85 ( Fig . 6 K , O ) , or in cells treated with the PI3 - kinase inhibitor Ly294002 ( 20 m M ) , suggesting that PI3 - kinase and MEK - MAPK did not contribute to the mechanism of endocytosis . Dynamin GTPase plays a critical role in the formation of clathrin - coated vesicles during endocytosis of many receptors ( Hinshaw and Schmid , 1995 ) , as shown by the ability of dominant - negative dynamin ( K44A ) to block effectively the formation of endocytotic - coated vesicles ( Damke et al . , 1994 ) . Dynamin - ( K44A ) also prevented L1 internalization in L1 - B35 cells ( Fig . 6 M ) , conﬁrming its role in internalizing L1 by a clathrin - mediated mechanism ( Kamiguchi et al . , 1998 ) in B35 cells . Al - though Rac has been shown to modulate receptor - mediated en - docytosis in some systems ( Lamaze et al . , 1996 ) , expression of dominant - negative Rac1 ( 17N ) in B35 cells did not affect L1 antibody - induced internalization ( data not shown ) , suggesting that this small GTPase did not regulate L1 endocytosis . Impor - tantly , the dynamin ( K44A ) mutant effectively inhibited L1 antibody - induced phosphorylation of HA – ERK2 in transfected B35 - L1 cells ( Fig . 5 A ) , thus indicating that an intact endocytotic mechanism was necessary for L1 triggering of the MAPK cascade . Taken together these results demonstrated that the dynamin - mediated internalization of L1 in B35 - L1 cells depended on pp60 c - src and that L1 endocytosis was required for activation of an MAPK cascade that regulated neurite outgrowth on L1 . DISCUSSION Here we report that an MAPK - signaling pathway mediates neu - rite outgrowth on L1 and requires pp60 c - src - dependent endocyto - sis . This is the ﬁrst demonstration of a neuronal function regu - lated by L1 via MAPK and of the role of pp60 c - src in regulating Figure 3 .

Neurosci . , June 1 , 2000 , 20 ( 11 ) : 4177 – 4188 4183 dynamin - mediated endocytosis of L1 as an essential initial step in MAPK activation . Key intermediates on the L1 – MAPK - signaling pathway were identiﬁed to be the small GTPase Rac and PI3 - kinase . Because ERKs activate gene expression via phos - phorylation of the transcription factors Elk - 1 ( Marais et al . , 1993 ) and CRE - binding protein ( Ginty et al . , 1994 ) , these results raise the possibility that neurite outgrowth may rely on signaling events in the growth cone and nucleus . The proposed signaling pathway is outlined in Figure 7 . Results of this study demonstrate the requirement of an intact MEK – ERK pathway in regulating neurite outgrowth by cerebel - lar neurons on an L1 substrate . ERK phosphorylation is widely used for neurite outgrowth in response to pleiotropic axon growth / guidance cues , which include L1m NCAM ( Schmid et al . , 1999 ) , the extracellular matrix ( Ihara et al . , 1997 ) , and neurotro - phins ( Xia et al . , 1995 ; Riccio et al . , 1997 ) . L1 signaling to MAPK may also function in synaptic plasticity as suggested from anti - body perturbation experiments ( Luthi et al . , 1994 ) , because ERKs are phosphorylated in neurons during b - adrenergic and serotonergic stimulation ( Koch et al . , 1994 ; Michael et al . , 1998 ) and in hippocampal long - term potentiation ( LTP ) ( English and Sweatt , 1997 ) . The extent of ERK phosphorylation triggered by L1 ( four - to ﬁvefold ) approximated that induced by NCAM ( Schmid et al . , 1999 ) , NGF ( Riccio et al . , 1997 ) , integrins ( Chen et al . , 1994 ) , and LTP ( English and Sweatt , 1997 ) , underscoring its potential physiological relevance . By transducing signals that converge within the MAPK pathway , adhesion molecules , growth factors , and neurotransmitters may coordinately regulate the growth or branching of axons and dendrites . While our work was in progress MAPK was shown to be activated in L1 - transfected NIH3T3 cells dependent on endocytosis ( Schaefer et al . , 1999 ) . Our studies in neural cells are in accord with this report but go further by demonstrating a physiological role for MAPK in L1 - dependent neurite outgrowth and by identifying pp60 c - src , Rac , and PI3 - kinase as key signaling intermediates in the pathway . An important ﬁnding of our work is the requirement for pp60 c - src in dynamin - dependent endocytosis of L1 and activation of MAPKs in neural cells . These results provide a mechanistic understanding of the inhibition of L1 - dependent neurite out - growth observed in src - minus neuronal cultures ( Ignelzi et al . , 1994 ) . Our studies suggest ( 1 ) that pp60 c - src acts as a gatekeeper of the MAPK cascade by regulating L1 endocytosis and ( 2 ) that endocytosis and MAPK activation are needed for neurite growth on L1 . Dynamin - mediated endocytosis is also an early step in MAPK activation induced by EGF ( Vieira et al . , 1996 ) , serotonin 5 - HT1A ( Della Rocca et al . , 1999 ) , insulin - like growth factor I ( Chow et al . , 1998 ) , lysophosphatidic acid ( Luttrell et al . , 1997 ) , and b 2 - adrenergic agonists ( Daaka et al . , 1998 ) . Although only L1 and the b 2 - adrenergic receptor have been shown to depend on pp60 c - src for endocytosis and MAPK activation ( Ahn et al . , 1999 ) , it is conceivable that Src family kinases may participate in endo - cytosis / signaling by other receptors . It remains to be determined whether L1 clustering activates pp60 c - src by dephosphorylating Tyr 527 in the Src C - terminal domain ( Bjorge et al . , 1996 ) possibly via tyrosine phosphatase PTP - a ( Ponniah et al . , 1999 ) . A role for tyrosine phosphatases in L1 signaling is consistent with the ability of L1 antibodies to induce dephosphorylation of ty - rosine in growth cone proteins ( Atashi et al . , 1992 ; Klinz et al . , 1995 ) . Because neurite outgrowth by cerebellar neurons on L1 was not totally suppressed by MEK inhibitors or in src - minus neurons ( Ignelzi et al . , 1994 ) , there may be an additional Src / MAPK - independent mechanism for L1 - dependent neurite growth . For example , neurite growth responses in common to L1 , NCAM , and N - cadherin have been shown to occur via the basic ﬁbroblast growth factor receptor , phospholipase C , and produc - tion of arachidonic acid ( Saffell et al . , 1997 ) . It should be noted that because different cell types ( cerebellar neurons and B35 neuroblastoma cells ) were used to measure neurite outgrowth and endocytosis , the results do not formally prove that endocy - tosis of L1 is required for the regulation of neurite outgrowth . Other than pp60 c - src it is not clear whether components of the L1 – MAPK cascade identiﬁed in B35 cells are also deployed for signal transduction and neurite outgrowth in cerebellar neurons and other neuronal cell types . Nonetheless , the ﬁnding that pp60 c - src was needed for ERK activation in both cell types and that deletion of the src gene causes inhibition of neurite out - growth in cerebellar neurons ( Ignelzi et al . , 1994 ) supports the possibility that Src - dependent endocytosis mediates neurite out - growth on L1 . L1 signaling , as delineated in B35 cells , differed from the prototypical Ras – MAPK cascade used by NCAM and integrins ( Schlaepfer and Hunter , 1997 ; Schmid et al . , 1999 ) in its inde - pendence from Ras and Fak . However , Ras - independent ( Howe and Juliano , 1998 ) and FAK - independent signaling pathways are Figure 5 .

FAK - independent signaling in platelets shares with the L1 pathway the involvement of pp60 c - src , Rac , and PI3 - kinase ( Miranti et al . , 1998 ) . Although we have not found b 1 - integrins stably associated with L1 , a role for speciﬁc b - integrin subtypes in L1 – MAPK signaling remains open , be - cause L1 has been shown to interact functionally with integrins for neurite outgrowth and cell migration on L1 , mediated in part by an RGD sequence in the sixth Ig domain ( Montgomery et al . , 1996 ; Yip et al . , 1998 ) . Neuronal growth cones display distinctive morphologies on L1 , NCAM , and laminin ( Payne et al . , 1992 ; Abosch and Lagenaur , 1993 ; Burden - Gulley et al . , 1995 , 1997 ) ; yet each substrate can activate MAPKs , raising the question of how speciﬁcity arises . Activation of different signaling intermediates on the MAPK pathway may allow neurons to respond to extracellular cues in distinct ways . In B35 cells , L1 signals to MAPK via pp60 c - src , PI3 - kinase , and Rac , whereas NCAM140 signals to MAPK via Fyn , FAK , Ras , and Rho ( Schmid et al . , 1999 ) . Nonetheless , the involvement of Rac in L1 signaling is consistent with the lamel - lipodial morphology displayed by growth cones of retinal gan - glion cells on L1 ( Payne et al . , 1992 ; Burden - Gulley et al . , 1995 ) . Activated Rho family GTPases differentially modulate actin cy - toarchitecture ( Nobes and Hall , 1995 ) . Rac generates lamellipo - dia by inducing actin depolymerization via LIM kinase - 1 ( Arber et al . , 1998 ; Yang et al . , 1998 ) , Rho induces actin stress ﬁbers and growth cone collapse ( Kozma et al . , 1997 ) , and Cdc42 elicits ﬁlopodia via LIM kinase - 2 ( Sumi et al . , 1999 ) .

PI3 - kinase is an important determi - nant of growth cone guidance , required for the turning of Xeno - pus growth cones toward a netrin gradient ( Hong et al . , 1999 ) . The ability of L1 to phosphorylate ERKs via Rac could occur by cross - cascade stimulation of MEK . Rac typically activates the JNK pathway ( Crespo et al . , 1996 ) but is an upstream regulator of p21 - activated kinase , which directly phosphorylates MEK and stimulates ERK phosphorylation in a Ras - independent manner ( Frost et al . , 1997 ) . Such cross - talk allows pathways for Rac activation to cooperate with prototypical Ras – Raf – MEK – MAPK pathways ( Frost et al . , 1997 ) . In this way , NCAM or neurotrophin signaling via Ras may cooperate with L1 signaling via Rac for MAPK activation and neurite outgrowth . Although we found no evidence of c - Raf 1 or B - Raf in L1 signaling , basal levels of a Raf isoform might participate . The ability of L1 clustering to activate PI3 - kinase also supports a role for L1 in neuronal survival . PI3 - kinase promotes neuronal survival and blocks apoptosis in response to neurotrophins and insulin - like growth factor I via the serine / threonine kinase Akt ( Ashcroft et al . , 1999 ) . Although Akt was not examined in our studies , a role for L1 in neuronal survival is consistent with a 30 % reduction in the number of hippocampal neurons in L1 knock - out mice ( Demyanenko et al . , 1999 ) and with the ability of L1 to enhance the survival of dopaminergic neurons ( Hulley et al . , 1998 ) and to prevent apoptotic death of cerebellar and hippocam - pal neurons in culture ( Chen et al . , 1999 ) . Src - mediated endocytosis of L1 has the potential for not only local actin cytoskeletal rearrangements in the growth cone but also nuclear transcriptional control . Via Rac and PI3 - kinase , L1 could cause actin rearrangements to form lamellipodial exten - sions needed for neurite elongation . Endocytosis of L1 might also serve to release the growth cone from attachment to the substra - tum , facilitating its forward migration . L1 in endocytic vesicles would be oriented with its C terminal projecting toward the cytoplasm , enabling downstream signaling molecules in the growth cone to be recruited and / or activated , a scenario consis - tent with the observation that activated ERK colocalizes with L1 in endocytosed vesicles of L1 - transfected ﬁbroblasts ( Schaefer et al . , 1999 ) . L1 - signaling complexes might also be transported from the growth cone to the cell body , as shown for internalized NGF – Trk receptor complexes in pheochromocytoma 12 cells ( Riccio et al . , 1997 ) . There dually phosphorylated ERKs would be in position to translocate into the nucleus , where they may induce transcription of the genes needed for neuronal process extension or cell survival .

Figure 7 . Proposed L1 - signaling pathway . Cross - linking of L1 molecules on the growth cone membrane is proposed to induce dynamin - mediated endocytosis of L1 via the Src tyrosine kinase , leading to initiation of an intracellular signal transduction cascade involving the sequential activa - tion of PI3 - kinase , Rac , MEK , and MAPK . Inhibitors of PI3 - kinase ( Ly294002 ) and MEK ( PD98059 and U0126 ) are shown . It is suggested that Rac activation in the growth cone leads to cytoskeletal changes resulting in lamellipodia and that MAPK may have nuclear effects on gene expression , both of which may be needed for neurite outgrowth . 4186 J .
