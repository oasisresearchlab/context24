S . A . Real options reasoning ( ROR ) is a conceptual approach to strategic investment that takes into account the value of preserving the right to make future choices under uncertain conditions . In this study , we explore ﬁrms’ motivations to invest in a new option . We ﬁnd , based on an analysis of a large sample of patents by ﬁrms active in the pharmaceutical industry , that their investments in R & D are consistent with the logic of ROR . We identify three constructs—scope of opportunity , prior experience , and competitive effects—which have an inﬂuence on ﬁrms’ propensity to invest in new R & D options and which could usefully be incorporated in a strategic theory of investment . Copyright  2003 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strategic management research has long focused on understanding differentials in performance across ﬁrms ( Helfat , 2000 ) . An important expla - nation for observed differentials in performance is the ability of ﬁrms to introduce innovations that permit them to garner rents . Broadly con - strued , innovation consists of the development of new products , new processes , and / or new markets ( Schumpeter , 1934 ) . The rents attainable through innovative activities are often termed ‘Schumpeter - ian’ or ‘entrepreneurial’ rents , because they are the rewards to ﬁrms who are prepared to act in the face of ex ante uncertainty ( Knight , 1921 ; Rumelt , 1987 ) . While innumerable empirical studies have linked innovation to superior performance ( e . g . , Lawless and Anderson , 1996 ; Christensen , 1997 ) and many scholars have offered theoretical insights on decision making surrounding innovation within ﬁrms ( March , 1991 ; Van de Ven , 1986 ; Dougherty , Key words : real options ; pharmaceutical industry ; patent - ing ; innovation * Correspondence to : Rita Gunther McGrath , Graduate School of Business , Columbia University , Armstrong Hall , 4th Floor , 2880 Broadway , New York , NY 10025 , U . S . A . 1992 ) , little empirical research integrates norma - tive theories developed largely in ﬁnance , and behavioral theories emerging from organizations research regarding the drivers of decisions to invest in innovation . In this paper , we use real options reasoning ( ROR ) to bridge these theories , by examining innovation investment decisions that take a ﬁrm into new technological areas . We characterize the initial foray into a new technological area as a real option , which creates a somewhat proprietary opportunity for the investing ﬁrm to make later decisions , such as to further exploit or to exit the area ( Kim and Kogut , 1996 ) . The question we address in this paper is : Why do ﬁrms take out real technology options ? A real options perspective offers a comple - mentary approach to normative models of invest - ments under uncertainty borrowed from the ﬁeld of ﬁnance ( Fama and French , 1992 , 1993 , 1995 , 1996 ) and behavioral theories of decision making ( March , 1991 ) . Where ﬁnance theories are based on assumptions of efﬁcient markets and static equi - librium , ROR presumes information asymmetries , Copyright  2003 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Received 17 December 2001 Final revision received 9 June 2003 2 R . G . McGrath and A . Nerkar path - dependent accumulation processes , and uncer - tainty ( Miller , 1998 ) . As many scholars have observed , assumptions borrowed from the ﬁeld of ﬁnance are often at odds with managerial realities , leading to lack of support for hypothesized rela - tionships and to observed inconsistency in manage - rial application ( Dixit , 1992 ) . Chatterjee , Lubatkin , and Schulze ( 1999 ) suggest that a key reason such inconsistencies occur is that the markets in which ﬁrms compete ‘are not as perfect’ as the assumptions underlying models from ﬁnance might suggest . Nonetheless , powerful ideas from ﬁnance offer an economic rationale for observed manage - rial behavior . Kogut ( 1983 , 1991 ) , Bowman and Hurry ( 1993 ) , and Sanchez ( 1993 ) were early advocates of resolv - ing the tension between the rationality of ﬁnance - based models and the observations of behavioral researchers through an options lens . As they point out , options reasoning accommodates the value of ﬂexibility , differing resource allocation horizons , the process of retrospective sense making , and path dependence . In this paper , we offer support for an options perspective by showing that the investment strategies of a group of ﬁrms—in this case , pharmaceutical ﬁrms—are consistent with ROR . By ‘real options reasoning , ’ we mean to imply that decision - makers implicitly ( or explic - itly ) respond to the value of the right to preserve decision rights in the future in their investment choices . We believe that ROR can explain some of the differences between actual managerial invest - ment behavior and theorized investment behavior . Our goal is to advance a theory of investment appropriate to the strategy ﬁeld . In short , we seek to explore whether decision - makers in pharmaceutical ﬁrms demonstrate ROR in R & D investments . We follow an established body of scholarly work that identiﬁes certain investment decisions as amenable to ROR , then examines evidence for whether actual investment patterns are consistent with the predictions of real options theory . Such analyses have been conducted with respect to joint ventures ( Kogut , 1991 ) , inter - national entry decisions ( Chi and McGuire , 1996 ; Reuer and Leiblein , 2000 ) , governance choices in collaboration ( Folta , 1998 ) , foreign direct invest - ment decisions ( Kogut and Kulatilaka , 1994 ) , and R & D investments ( Kumaraswamy , 1996 ) . If we ﬁnd such evidence , it suggests to us that ROR has much to contribute to a theory of investment in the ﬁeld of strategy . The research reported here builds upon a growing literature that offers empir - ical evidence to test propositions originating from ROR ( such as Hurry , Miller , and Bowman , 1992 ; Folta , 1998 ; and Kumaraswamy , 1996 ) . We studied patterns of R & D patenting for all participants in the U . S . pharmaceutical industry over a period of 17 years ( from 1979 to 1995 ) , with emphasis on the strategies of the leading 31 ﬁrms . Our focus was on identifying inﬂuences on the decision of ﬁrms to invest in growth options . We operationalized the decision to take out options in an R & D arena by measuring patents in phar - maceutical subclasses , on the premise that with - out investment input the knowledge creation that leads to patenting outputs would be impossible . We believe the study to be timely , for although ROR has attracted considerable scholarly attention , empirical research is still rather sparse . REAL OPTIONS REASONING AND STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS In recent research there has been intense inter - est in understanding how ROR might usefully complement net present value - based approaches to investment decisions ( Mitchell and Hamilton , 1988 ; Nichols , 1994a ; McGrath , 1997 ; Trigeor - gis , 1996 ; see also Bettis and Hitt , 1995 ) . A fur - ther incentive is for scholars to develop models that more closely align with managerial practice . Brennan ( 1995 : 17 ) observed in a retrospective of developments in ﬁnance that a general trend in cor - porate ﬁnance is a ‘shift away from attempts to prescribe normative rules for decision - makers that would assist them to take decisions that are opti - mal from the point of view of shareholders and towards attempts to describe more realistically the way that decisions are actually made’ ( emphasis in the original ) . An option creates value by generating future decision rights . The theory of real options , in which the option in question is a real asset , is derived from theories originally developed in ﬁnance to account for the value of ﬁnancial options contracts ( Black and Scholes , 1973 ) . A ﬁnancial option contract conveys the right , but not the obli - gation , on the purchaser to either buy or sell an underlying asset at some point in the future . By analogy , an investment in a real option conveys the right , but not the obligation , for a ﬁrm to make fur - ther investments or defer such investments . Thus , Copyright  2003 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 25 : 1 – 21 ( 2004 ) Real Options and Pharmaceutical R & D 3 a ﬁrm that invests in R & D can create a unit of new knowledge . It can secure its claim to com - mercialize this knowledge through patenting . Sub - sequently , it may elect to proceed to extend the knowledge , commercialize its knowledge , to do nothing with it , or to seek to leverage the knowl - edge in some other way , for example by sharing it with a joint venture partner or licensing it out . Investing in real options can allow ﬁrms access to a greater variety of opportunities than would be possible if each investment represented a full - scale launch . The cost of an option on an asset is small , relative to the cost of purchasing the asset . Thus , with the same resources to spend , more opportunities can be explored using options . Once uncertainty is reduced , an investor can then elect to exercise only those options that are ‘in the money’ and allow the remainder to expire . By investing relatively small amounts in learning about several promising technical directions simul - taneously , a ﬁrm can broaden the range of alter - natives it can apprehend , generating conceptual variety with parsimony . As Gavetti and Levinthal ( 2000 : 115 – 116 ) point out , ‘If low - outcome draws can be costlessly discarded , then greater variance in the sample , holding the mean constant , increases the expected value of those draws that are adopted . This is the basic intuition behind the recent inter - est in the idea of “real options” in the business strategy literature . ’ Expanding the number of trials that can be undertaken when uncertainty is high is valuable from a strategic point of view . As Chatterjee et al . ( 1999 : 560 ) point out , ‘strategy is about making resource commitments before the relation - ship between these commitments and their poten - tial performance outcomes are fully understood . ’ Options , they suggest , are an important mecha - nism through which ﬁrms reduce the strategic risk of making commitments . From their argument , we can identify constructs that are relevant to a strate - gic theory of investment incorporating ROR . Here , we will focus on variance or scope of the oppor - tunity , portfolio or prior experience effects , and competitive effects in the R & D investment deci - sion . The logic for selecting these constructs is that variance is relevant to the individual invest - ment proposition , portfolio effects to the activities of the ﬁrm as a whole , and option expiration to the viability of the underlying asset on which options are taken in future competition . They thus reﬂect the inﬂuence of factors at three levels of analysis relevant to the value of a real option . Scope of opportunity Strategic decisions with respect to entry into new markets have at their core ﬁrm - speciﬁc risk . The core question is whether an investment or entry into a new area has the potential to help a ﬁrm protect its future earnings streams from industry and macro - economic pressures reﬂected in mar - ket portfolio returns . If such entry contributes to competitive advantage , investment in the area is valuable , a conclusion that is not controversial ( Porter , 1980 ) . However , it is important to consider the scope of opportunity , potential access to other avenues of growth or , in other words , the variance underlying such investments . For ﬁnancial options , an increase in the scope of the opportunity repre - sented by the volatility of the stock on which an option contract is written leads to an increase in the value of the option . This occurs because the investment in the option is ﬁxed at the price of the option , giving the investor access to a greater range of potential outcomes on the upside , while con - taining exposure on the downside . This effectively truncates the left - hand tail of a performance distri - bution , creating a performance distribution curve that is skewed to the right , yielding asymmetric pay - offs . The real options analogue is that provided the downside loss an organization would sustain if it elects to stop further investment in a technology area is contained , its investments increase in value with increases in variance of results ( Mitchell and Hamilton , 1988 ) . Thus , the presence of poten - tially high variance in performance outcomes for an investment should be positively associated with investment using ROR , where they might depress the value of an investment using other approaches ( Morris , Teisberg , and Kolbe , 1991 ) . In an argument consistent with this line of thought , Dixit and Pindyck ( 1994 ) have suggested that a test for the presence of ROR in R & D strategy is whether those making investment choices favor exploratory research , with a scope well beyond that of current activities . Exploratory research is likely to show the potential for opening up new lines of scientiﬁc inquiry in a signiﬁcant manner , increasing the potential variance of returns . Such increase in scope can potentially lead to a radi - cal departure from prevailing practice . The greater Copyright  2003 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 25 : 1 – 21 ( 2004 ) 4 R . G . McGrath and A . Nerkar the scope of an opportunity area , the greater is the potential upside of an uncertain investment . The following hypothesis is consistent with our expectations that the presence of ROR in invest - ment decisions will be reﬂected in a propensity to engage in more exploratory R & D : Hypothesis 1 : There will be a positive associ - ation between a ﬁrm’s propensity to take out growth options in a new technological area and the scope of the opportunity area . Prior experience In large pharmaceutical ﬁrms , the R & D function encompasses many projects across many therapeu - tic and scientiﬁc areas . Decisions about making investments in R & D are therefore always made in the context of a portfolio of other , compet - ing investments . As we observed earlier , making investments in options implies that an investor can explore a larger number of possibilities than were each exploratory foray to be a full launch . But does ROR offer any insight into trade - offs decision - makers must make when considering alternative investment proposals ? Conventional investment theory suggests that ﬁrms should proceed to invest in all projects with a positive net present value . If resources for invest - ment are limited , as would be the case under capital rationing , the conventional wisdom is to establish a discounted cash ﬂow valuation for each project independently . The next step is to eval - uate which combinations of affordable projects would yield the ﬁrm the highest total net present value , then invest in this combination of projects . The assumptions underlying this approach are that projects can be evaluated independently , and that their joint effect on future value is largely additive ( although correct application of the NPV rule is based on incremental cash ﬂows ) . ROR allows instead for an interaction among investments that changes the value not only of a given investment but also of the other options within a ﬁrm’s R & D portfolio . Because options interact , making a decision with respect to one option affects the value of other options . For instance , subsequent option investments in R & D arenas can increase the value of options opened earlier , because they lead to increase in the value of the underlying knowledge as such knowledge is typically created in a path - dependent cumulative manner ( Nelson and Winter , 1982 ) . Lack of con - tinued investment in an arena can also diminish the value of earlier options because this terminates the learning process , effectively extinguishing the earlier option ( Dierickx and Cool , 1989 ; Trige - orgis , 1996 : 257 – 258 ) . Because options within a portfolio may not be additive , and because opening options consumes resources , adding more options to an existing portfolio does not necessar - ily increase the value of the portfolio . Real options that are compound options often involve nested investments such as entry into new technologi - cal areas ( Miller and Folta , 2002 ) . For instance , patents in new areas can be considered as com - pound options that require additional investments before the value of the original option is real - ized . This is in stark contrast to the net present value approach , which largely assumes indepen - dence and additivity for each project . Present value analysis also does not explicitly recognize the often positive effects on the value of an asset of deferring investment or of the risk of loss of value due to option expiration . As we mentioned , the decision to open or not open an option has value under conditions of uncertainty . The value of waiting , however , is sensitive to the extent to which contingencies are highly uncertain , and the claim of a ﬁrm on the underlying real asset can be maintained . As uncertainty is reduced over time , the beneﬁts of waiting relative to investing or abandoning decrease . Trigeorgis ( 1996 : 241 ) , for instance , suggests that the value of the option if not exercised is subject to diminishing returns with the passage of time . This insight has important portfolio implications . For a decision - maker using ROR , the value of a new option will be inﬂuenced by the presence of preexisting options . Moreover , its contribution to a ﬁrm’s existing portfolio of R & D opportunities depends to a large extent on the ﬁrm’s prior experience and the declining value of waiting to exercise previously created options . Thus , if a ﬁrm has made extensive investments in opening options , its managers should not be anxious to open still more options . Rather , they will be inclined to invest in better understanding those options they have already created , because the value of their option to defer exercise will begin to decline if they do not . Regardless of the inherent attractiveness of a new opportunity , if a ﬁrm’s resources are already engaged in the pursuit of other attractive opportunities , it is likely to value new ones less . This is consistent with March’s Copyright  2003 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 25 : 1 – 21 ( 2004 ) Real Options and Pharmaceutical R & D 5 ( 1991 ) proposition that ﬁrms need to incorporate a balance of exploration and exploitation - oriented investments in their knowledge - creating strategies . We thus suggest that extensive prior commitment is likely to dampen enthusiasm for subsequent investment , as in this hypothesis : Hypothesis 2a : There will be a negative associ - ation between ﬁrm propensity to take out growth options in new technological areas and the extensiveness of its commitments to new areas in the past . A second , portfolio - related characteristic consists of the ﬁrm’s experience or previous track record of investing in new areas . Strong incentives exist for learners to deepen their understanding of areas in which they have gained initial experience . This is due to increases in absorptive capacity that make the assimilation of each new unit of knowl - edge easier , faster , and less expensive ( Cohen and Levinthal , 1990 ) . Further , self - reinforcing behav - iors cause the level of competence with an exist - ing technology to exceed the level of compe - tence a learner could quickly achieve with a new technology , however potentially superior the new one might be ( Levitt and March , 1988 ; Lane and Lubatkin , 1998 ) . With respect to R & D invest - ments , Sørensen and Stuart ( 2000 ) ﬁnd empirical evidence supportive of the idea that as ﬁrms age and gain experience with the knowledge genera - tion process they pursue more innovations . Other researchers have suggested that this effect is most pronounced when the new innovations sustain previous technological trajectories for established ﬁrms ( Christensen , 1997 ; Henderson and Clark , 1990 ) . Extending the argument we developed above , a ﬁrm that has opened options on an area will have incentives to persist in making investments in that area . Because the value of an option is subject to diminishing returns , a ﬁrm cannot indeﬁnitely put off making a decision with respect to the new area without the value of its existing options eroding . Further , the decision to divert resources from an option ( once opened ) to pursue another opportu - nity effectively decreases the value of the original option in two ways . First , it truncates the poten - tial of the investing ﬁrm to idiosyncratically reduce uncertainty and claim an underlying asset for itself . Second , the decision to divert resources implies that the routines accumulated to date in exploring the option will be forgotten , essentially leading the option to expire . The effect is to diminish the ﬁrm’s incentive to invest in attractive new areas because it is already committed to areas it had pre - viously explored . We can state this argument as a hypothesis : Hypothesis 2b : There will be a negative asso - ciation between a ﬁrm’s propensity to take out growth options in a new technological area and its cumulative investment experience in previous technological areas . Competition The third construct we consider in our exploration of ROR concerns the effects of competition on a ﬁrm’s propensity to invest in new options . Attrac - tive opportunities tend to attract competition . This creates a tension for the decision - maker . On the one hand , options on more attractive spaces are likely to be more valuable while , on the other , competitors are likely to also perceive the oppor - tunity and seek to take out their own options . Further , a key premise of ROR is that investments are sequential . Failing to take out an investment when others are investing creates the potential for subsequent lock - out . The use of ROR should be reﬂected in the way in which this tension is resolved ( Dixit , 1992 ) . Decision - makers from different ﬁrms are likely to have different expectations with respect to the worth of an emerging arena . The behavior of com - peting ﬁrms is then interpreted as either supporting or disconﬁrming these expectations . If a decision - maker observes that no other ﬁrm is taking out options in an area that he or she has independently concluded is attractive , one reasonable inference is that the judgment was excessively optimistic , which decreases the incentive to invest . If no other organizations take out options , it makes sense to postpone investment . Conversely , let one ﬁrm invest and decision - makers from other ﬁrms are likely to revise their expectations upward , creating what Dixit ( 1992 : 119 ) calls a ‘bunching’ of invest - ment . Investment by one thus provokes investment by many ( see also Trigeorgis , 1991 ) . Because knowledge development is a cumula - tive process , competitive entry into an area is not only a signal of its attractiveness , but actually does make the arena more valuable by increasing the total investment in knowledge creation across all Copyright  2003 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 25 : 1 – 21 ( 2004 ) 6 R . G . McGrath and A . Nerkar actors in the area . Hambrick , MacMillan , and Bar - bosa’s ( 1983 ) conclusion that total investment mat - ters more than relative investment to technological success is supportive of this argument . When a new technological area is just emerging , it is in the collective interest of all participants to invest to create a substantive body of underlying scientiﬁc knowledge , and even to share this knowledge with one another ( see McGrath and McGrath , 2001 , for a recent review of the issues involved in knowl - edge spillovers ) . Singly and collectively , ﬁrm - level investments in R & D thus help to deepen knowledge in a ﬁeld , reducing uncertainty . Dixit and Pindyck ( 1994 ) refer to the taking of such options in uncertain new areas as investments to reduce ‘technical uncer - tainty . ’ This uncertainty cannot be reduced by postponing investment , unlike uncertainties that might have to do with purely exogenous factors such as the cost of raw materials inputs . High lev - els of technical uncertainty thus create pressure to invest . 1 We capture this set of arguments in the following hypothesis : Hypothesis 3 : There will be a positive associa - tion between ﬁrm propensity to take out growth options in new technological areas and compe - tition in those areas . RESEARCH METHODS Research setting : The pharmaceutical industry Investment in pharmaceutical R & D has often been characterized in the literature as investment in the creation of real options ( Dixit and Pindyck , 1994 ; Trigeorgis , 1996 : 1 – 30 ; Mitchell and Hamilton , 1988 ; McGrath , 1997 ) . Indeed , it is precisely the uncertainty , long time horizons and asymmetric pay - off distributions to investments in R & D that have prompted considerable scholarly and prac - tical interest in furthering the development of real options theory for pharmaceutical R & D ( for instance , at Merck ; Nichols , 1994b ) . The pharmaceutical industry is attractive as a setting in which to test ideas about ROR . R & D 1 Increasing competition typically leads to decreases in proﬁt potential in the context of product markets ( Porter , 1980 ) but not necessarily in technology markets ( Arora , Fosfuri , and Gam - bardella , 2001 ) . In such cases , using real options as a preemptive mechanism might be a useful strategy . See Miller and Folta ( 2002 ) for a detailed exposition of these and related issues . investment in pharmaceuticals can be assessed by reference to published patents . Patents are an important source of technological advantage in general but more speciﬁcally in the pharmaceutical industry ( Levin et al . , 1987 ) , with the consequence that it is a reasonable assumption on our part that investment in an area is reﬂected by the patents granted to a ﬁrm in that area . Successful patenting is a precursor to product development in pharma - ceuticals . The upside of a successful discovery that becomes a new drug is assured , to some extent , by the intellectual property protections in the patent . We use patent data to assess the propensity to make R & D investments by ﬁrms , consistent with the research efforts of other scholars who have used patents to measure R & D knowledge ( Ahuja , 2000 ; Silverman , 1999 ; Dutta and Weiss , 1997 ; Hender - son and Cockburn , 1994 ; Jaffe , Trajtenberg and Henderson , 1993 ; Engelsman and van Raan , 1994 ) . There is considerable precedent for our treat - ment of patents as real options . Pakes ( 1986 ) , for instance , uses option valuation to assess the propensity of patent holders to exercise or allow their patents to expire . Patents align with the cri - teria for a real option . Because the pay - off to later commercialization is uncertain , their perfor - mance distribution is unknown . Because taking out a patent does not commit the ﬁrm to follow - on commercialization , a ﬁrm can control the poten - tial downside loss and make sequential decisions , creating the asymmetric distribution of potential returns that is characteristic of real options . In short , a patent confers on the ﬁrm the right but not the obligation to make further investments , culmi - nating in a decision whether to commercialize its knowledge or not . Investments made towards com - mercializing the knowledge underlying the patent are analogous to the exercise price on the real option . Operationalizing options in R & D investment decisions A core issue for our empirical research is distin - guishing among those decisions that might result from random chance or luck and those that result from strategic decision making ( Alchian , 1950 ; Barney , 1986 ) . We have operationalized invest - ment in an option as the granting of a sec - ond patent to a ﬁrm in a technological area that was previously new to it . One could argue that obtaining a ﬁrst patent in a new area could arise Copyright  2003 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 25 : 1 – 21 ( 2004 ) Real Options and Pharmaceutical R & D 7 because of luck . The patent might simply be a product of the uncertain stochastic processes that underlie success and failure in R & D ( Levinthal , 1990 ; Nelson and Winter , 1982 ) . Irrespective of whether taking out a ﬁrst patent can be viewed as an option or not , a second patent in a new area is prime evidence of the initiation of a pattern of investment in that area , indicates a ﬁrm - level commitment to that area and is a much stronger indicator of a deliberate choice to focus there than a ﬁrst patent . We collected data for the period 1971 – 95 , but we used only the data in our sample from 1979 to 1995 , a period of 17 years , to test our hypothe - ses . The data we collected from 1971 to 1979 were used to help alleviate the problem of left censoring by ensuring that we did not systemati - cally omit patents whose precursor investment took place before our period of observation began , or count third patents as second patents because a ﬁrst patent was granted in the period before our observation period began . We deﬁned a technological area in a way that is consistent with U . S . Patent Ofﬁce Classiﬁcations and earlier research ( Shane , 2001 ; Ahuja , 2000 ; Rosenkopf and Nerkar , 2001 ) . Each patent con - tains extensive information about the inventor , the company to which the patent is assigned , the tech - nological antecedents of the invention in the form of other patents that it cites , and the claims each patent proposes for its technical contribution . The above information can be accessed in computer - ized form . Every patent is assigned to a three - digit technical class . Within each three - digit class there are many subclasses . In this study , we deﬁne a technical area as the three - digit subclass within the 514 area ( i . e . , drugs and bio - affecting compo - sitions ) as the pharmaceutical class ( Penner - Hahn , 1998 ) . The unit of analysis is the individual patent and its associated content , and the level of the analysis is the ﬁrm . We consider only patents ﬁled in the United States . The sources for this information include the U . S . Patent and Trademark Examiners Ofﬁce and online databases such as Lexis - Nexis  and Derwent  . Focal organizations Our research question relates to the strategic choices made by ﬁrms . In the pharmaceutical industry , 31 ﬁrms account for 80 percent of all drug development and patenting in the phar - maceutical sector . The remaining actors include smaller start - up organizations , universities , inde - pendent researchers , and a variety of other ﬁrms ( for instance , those not competing in pharmaceuti - cals at all ) . For purposes of our study , the invest - ment decisions of greatest interest are those involv - ing the 31 major players in pharmaceuticals . The data set on which we test our hypotheses consists of 45 , 757 patents established by these 31 ﬁrms from the 17 - year period from 1979 to 1995 . Each of the 31 ﬁrms lists as their primary Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation ( SIC ) code Number 2834 ( pharmaceutical ) and each had at least 100 patents granted to them during the time frame of the study . By examining these ﬁrms , we capture the major - ity of activity taking place in the pharmaceutical sector . The results of our analysis may not generalize across smaller ﬁrms with fewer than 100 patents . It is important for the reader to realize this , because smaller ﬁrms are regarded as likely to undertake more exploratory forays in the development of new technical knowledge , have fewer resources , and are apt to be more limited in the extent to which they open new options . During the period of the study , based on the 47 , 757 patents , the ﬁrms in our sample took out 7654 ﬁrst patents and 4013 second patents in the same technical area ( patent subclass ) . Our sample of options thus consists of 4013 observations of second patents in technological areas new to the ﬁrms taking out the patents . A sample data point is shown in Figure 1 . Dependent variable The dependent variable for this study is the propen - sity of a ﬁrm to take out a new option , which is operationalized as the instantaneous probability or hazard rate of taking out a second patent in a patent subclass that is new to the ﬁrm ( i . e . , it has only one previous patent in a pharmaceutical subclass that it had not patented in before ) . Independent variables Scope of opportunity The scope of an investment in a second patent is measured by the potential of the opportunity presented by the ﬁrst patent for a ﬁrm .

We use two measures of scope : claims made in the patent and overall potential . Number of claims . While the number of classes indicates the categorization of knowledge within the patent into different areas , the entire patent is constructed around the claims it makes ( Tong and Frame , 1994 ) . A claim is the actual contribution made by the invention . For instance , a patent ﬁled by a ﬁrm with respect to a cure for arthritis might have two claims . The ﬁrst one deals with the compound , while the second describes the manner in which it is administered . Firms are only allowed to ﬁle claims that are considered nontrivial and nonobvious by the patent examiner . In addition to potential within and outside pharmaceuticals , the number of claims made by a patent indicates the areas of impact . More claims increase the potential application areas for a patent ( Lanjouw and Schankerman , 1999 ) , increasing variance in performance outcomes and hence the option value of pursuing a second patent . To measure breadth of potential impact we measured the number of claims granted in the ﬁrst patent . Overall potential . Following Lerner ( 1995 ) , Ros - enkopf and Nerkar ( 2001 ) , and Shane ( 2001 ) , who suggest that patents classiﬁed in more technologi - cal areas are broader in scope , we operationalized the scope of a patent by measuring the number of technological classes into which it is categorized . Prior experience Extensiveness of previous commitments was mea - sured by counting the cumulative number of new areas entered by the ﬁrm . First we determined the total number of all new technical areas ( new subclasses ) that the ﬁrm has entered in the past , measured at the time that the ﬁrst patent in the current new technical area was granted . The more options it has taken out in the past , the more the ﬁrm needs to be concerned with expiration of those options . Cumulative investment experience : here we used two measures . Pharmaceutical patents . This is the cumulative number of patents the ﬁrm has been granted in the pharmaceutical sector , calculated at the time when the ﬁrst patent in a new technical area was granted . This is a measure of the degree to which the ﬁrm may be concerned with exploitation of existing options . Non - pharmaceutical patents . This is measured as the cumulative number of patents that the ﬁrm has been granted in other sectors , calculated at the time when the ﬁrst patent in a new technical area was granted . This is another , even broader measure of the degree to which the ﬁrm may be concerned with the exploitation of existing options . Effects of competition We used two measures for effect of competition . Competitor commitment . This is measured as the average number of patents granted per competitor in the new technical area for the ﬁrm , measured at the time the ﬁrst patent was granted to the ﬁrm in that new technical area . 2 Very low commitment by competitors indicates limited opportunity for ﬁrms seeking patents , signaling a sparse environment unattractive to potential new entrants . A large number of patents per competitor signals a hotly contested environment , also unattractive to new entrants . Number of competitors . This is measured as the number of competitors in the technical area at the time the ﬁrst patent in the new technical area was granted to the ﬁrm . Competitors were deﬁned as any other organization with patents in the technical area of concern . This might include not - for - proﬁt organizations ( such as universities ) . Figure 2 depicts the operationalization of our theoretical model developed in Hypotheses 1 , 2a , 2b , and 3 . Analytical techniques Following Podolny and Stuart ( 1995 ) and Podolny , Stuart , and Hannan ( 1996 ) we use event history 2 We also ran regression models with number of patents instead of patents per competitor and the results were similar . However , we prefer using patents per competitor as the number of patents is highly correlated with number of competitors . Copyright  2003 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt .

Hazard rate models are used as they incorporate information on both censored and uncensored cases , i . e . , whether a ﬁrm ﬁles a second patent in the area . If T is the duration since the ﬁrst patent was granted , then the instantaneous ( hazard ) rate of a second patent being ﬁled at time t is deﬁned as r ( t ) = lim (cid:1)t → 0 Pr ( t ≤ T < t + (cid:1)t ) (cid:1)t We modeled the hazard rate using semiparametric Cox models ( Cox , 1972 ; Kalbﬂeisch and Prentice , 1980 ; Allison , 1995 ) . The equation that we esti - mate takes the following speciﬁcation : r ( t ) = h ( t ) exp { Xβ } where r ( t ) is the transition rate or hazard rate of a second patent being ﬁled after the grant of the ﬁrst patent , h ( t ) is an unspeciﬁed baseline rate for the transition , X is a matrix of time - constant covariates and β is a vector of unknown regression parameter . Because h ( t ) is an unspeciﬁed step function , the Cox model offers an extremely ﬂexible means for modeling time dependence ( Sørensen and Stuart , 2000 ) . In this case X consists of the set of controls and the independent variables . The models also include dummy variables to control for ﬁxed ﬁrm and year effects that account for factors inside the ﬁrm and time - changing fac - tors that may have affected the pharmaceutical industry . These dummy variables control for omit - ted variables that may have constant effects on the ﬁrms in the sample but vary over time . Our analysis also includes the number of options taken out in the past ( second patents in new areas ) as an explanatory variable . By including the num - ber of times the dependent variable has previously occurred for each ﬁrm we control for unobserved heterogeneity ( Heckman and Borjas , 1980 ) . As Stuart ( 2000 ) indicates , by including such vari - ables we can control for the time constant effects of unobserved factors that produce variance in ﬁrms’ abilities or dispositions to patent in new areas .

The increase in log likelihood is statistically signiﬁcant as com - pared to the model that included only the ﬁrm and year ﬁxed effects . Also , the parameter estimates of both these variables are positive and statistically signiﬁcant , offering strong support for Hypothesis 1 . These results are consistent with ROR as there is an increasing propensity to take out a second patent , or real option , with corresponding increases in potential and claims . Model 2 includes only the variable for cumula - tive number of areas as a measure for the exten - siveness of prior experience . This variable is neg - ative , statistically signiﬁcant , and in the hypothe - sized direction , offering support for Hypothesis 2a . The improvement in log likelihood as compared to the baseline model with ﬁxed effects is also signiﬁcant . A similar result supporting Hypoth - esis 2b is seen in Model 3 , where only vari - ables measuring cumulative prior investments are included . These results generally support the argu - ment that the R & D investment decisions of the ﬁrm will be inﬂuenced by past option investment decisions , rather than showing no impact from pre - vious investments , as the net present value model might suppose . The independent effects of competition are tested for by including the two variables of competitor commitment and number of competitors in Model 4 . Both these variables are positive , statistically signiﬁcant , and in the hypothesized direction . The improvement in log likelihood over the baseline ﬁxed effects model is statistically signiﬁcant . The results of Model 4 generally support the ROR argu - ment that the R & D option decisions of the ﬁrm will be inﬂuenced by the signals of option poten - tial emanating from the activities of competition . The pattern of our results suggests that both the number of competitors and their patenting record will have a positive effect on a ﬁrm’s propensity to take out an option . Model 5 is the full model and a complete speciﬁcation that includes all variables measuring the different constructs described in the differ - ent hypotheses . All the independent effects except those represented by the variable measuring cumu - lative prior investments continue to be signiﬁ - cant in this model , offering strong support for Hypotheses 1 , 2a , and 3 , and partial support for Hypothesis 2b . Comparing the results across the four sets of constructs from Model 5 offers some insight into their relative strengths in terms of their impact on likelihood of taking out an option . An increase of 10 percent in the overall potential measure from its mean level leads to a 6 . 48 percent increase in the hazard of taking out an option 3 ( exp [ 0 . 034 × 1 . 8515 ] = 1 . 0648 ) . In contrast , an increase of 10 percent in the mean commitment exhibited by competitors leads to an increase of 51 . 6 percent in the hazard of taking out an option ( exp [ 0 . 2033 × 2 . 047 ] = 0 . 1516 ) . The correspond - ing percentage increase or decrease in the hazard of taking out a second patent with 10 percent increase in mean value of the various constructs is as follows : claims ( 6 . 56 ) , cumulative areas entered ( 37 . 9 ) , pharmaceutical patents is ( − 1 . 72 ) , non - pharmaceutical patents is ( − 9 . 48 ) and number of competitors ( 28 . 31 ) . In other words , the effect of the average commitment exhibited by competitors is nearly eight times the magnitude of the effect of the average potential exhibited by the oppor - tunity area . The above comparison also suggests that competitive effects have the greatest inﬂu - ence on the likelihood of taking out an option , followed by prior options taken out and the scope of the opportunity . These differences in magnitude are consistent with research that technical attrac - tiveness is not the only variable that drives entry decisions ( Podolny and Stuart , 1995 ) . Effects of competition : Testing for curvilinear effects As uncertainty is reduced , however , the value of options decreases , and the potential value of the underlying knowledge asset becomes easier to assess . The implication is that , in the early stage of a new technological arena , the more competitors take out options , the greater will be the incentive for additional ﬁrms to take out options . As the area matures , however , continued investment will only be attractive for those ﬁrms who perceive that they will be in a good position to exercise their options . For the rest , allowing their options to expire ( or 3 To examine the multiplier effect of each variable on the hazard rate , keeping all other variables at their mean , one needs to compute the exponential function of the product of the new value of the focal variable and its parameter estimate . For instance , in our case the 10 percent increase in mean value of overall potential leads to a value of 1 . 8515 . On taking the exponential function of this value multiplied by the parameter estimate ( 0 . 34 ) we get the increase in the hazard rate , i . e . , 1 . 0648 . For a more detailed explanation of how multiplier rates are computed see appendix B of Haveman and Cohen ( 1994 ) . Copyright  2003 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt .

The options story is thus not so much about competition creating resource pressure upon rivals ( as in the ecological litera - ture ) but rather about strategic redirection of effort , based on the joint effects of uncertainty reduc - tion and the potential of heterogeneous resource combinations . Both the positive effects of collab - oration and positive spillovers from competitors doing R & D and the negative effects of rivalry amongst competition are possible on likelihood of entry . Thus the curvilinear results for competition are worth further exploration . To do this we ana - lyzed three models , shown in Table 4 , where we include the squared terms of the variables measur - ing effects of competition . Models 6 and 7 show support for the indepen - dent curvilinear effects of competitor commitment and number of competitors respectively . Model 8 includes both curvilinear effects and the results continue to support a curvilinear relationship bet - ween the likelihood of taking out an option and competition . To ﬁnd the point at which the impact of number of competitors on the hazard of taking an option is at a maximum , we differentiate the results for Model 8 with respect to number of competitors , and set the result equal to zero : 4 This gives : 0 . 0096 − 2 × ( 0 . 0315 ) × number of competitors / 1000 = 0 Solving gives the number of competitors as 152 . 6 . This suggests that the deterrent effects of excessive 4 In the absence of curvilinear effect of competitor commitment the number of competitors at which the hazard is at a maximum is 142 . 15 .

Nerkar competition on a ﬁrm’s propensity to invest are at their maximum when 152 competitors have entered the area . Only after as many as 152 competitors are in the market do ﬁrms actually ﬁnd the competi - tiveness discouraging , but the evidence of curvi - linearity suggests a negative marginal effect . The positive effect of increase in competition begins to tail off as the number of competitors increases . Examination of the basic statistics in Table 1 sug - gests that very few of the data points in our sample have a number of competitors exceeding 152 ( the mean number of competitors is 36 . 8 while the stan - dard deviation is 30 . 28 ) . 5 This result needs to be interpreted with care , as these 152 competitors are not competitors in the product market context but in the resource or R & D market . A brief exami - nation of a few entries in our data set suggests that early entrants in new areas are universities , research organizations , and independent inventors who are less likely to be interested in the commer - cial aspects of the knowledge they generate . Future research could examine the nature of competition in R & D markets to explore whether signals from entry of different competitors are equal . To ﬁnd the point at which the impact of number of patents per competitor on the hazard of taking an option is at a maximum we differentiate the results for Model 8 with respect to competitor commitment , and set the result equal to zero : 6 This gives : 0 . 4455 − 2 × 0 . 0461 × number of patents = 0 Solving gives the number of patents per com - petitor as 4 . 83 . This further supports the ROR argument—only after as many as 4 . 83 patents per competitor do ﬁrms reduce their patenting . Again statistics from Table 1 suggest very few cases in our sample have competitor commitment beyond 4 . 83 ( mean is 1 . 86 and standard deviation is 0 . 72 ) , but again the evidence of curvilinearity suggests a decreasing positive effect as the number of patents per competitor increases . In both cases the concave function obtained strongly suggests that the rate of increase in the log likelihood of a ﬁrm taking out an option goes down with increases in the number 5 We are thankful to an anonymous reviewer for identifying this pattern in our data . 6 In the absence of curvilinear effects of number of competitors the competitor commitment at which the hazard rate is maximum is 4 . 45 patents per competitor . of competitors and competitor commitment . Thus ﬁrms in our sample are initially increasingly , then decreasingly inclined to take out options in new technical areas as the opportunity space becomes more competitive . We see that the effect of patent / competitor is much more than that of number of competitors . This is consistent with the argument that com - petitive entry has an important signaling effect on the propensity to enter . Signs that competitors are making signiﬁcant headway in the new area , as evidenced by their success at patenting there , however , can be expected to act as a deterrent , consistent with our results . DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS Our study of R & D investments in the pharmaceuti - cal industry suggests that strategic decision - makers do either intuitively or explicitly use ROR when making investment choices under uncertainty . We identiﬁed three constructs that are derived from ROR but that at present have not been incorporated into a theory of investment for the ﬁeld of strat - egy , namely the potential for increased variance , effects of previous portfolio investments , and the tension created by competitive entry . Rather than being deterred in making investment by their potential variance enhancement , we found that scope ( potential of the previous patent in a new area ) had a positive effect on ﬁrms’ propensity to invest in R & D . One implication is that variance , measured as the scope of the opportunity area , rather than being a negative that would require greater risk premiums from investors , is positive when the investment in question is an option . An implication for the strategic theory of investment is that different standards should apply to evalu - ation for scope - increasing options as opposed to commitments . It may make sense to allocate dif - ferent resource pools for the different kinds of investments , because different assessment criteria are appropriate and because different discount rates are also appropriate . Such a distinction , based on options logic , was urged by McGrath and MacMil - lan ( 2000 : 163 – 196 ) . A criticism of net present value - based invest - ment models is that they tend to underestimate future cash ﬂows that are generated from oppor - tunities discovered at a later point in time than were obvious at the point of initial investment .

J . , 25 : 1 – 21 ( 2004 ) Real Options and Pharmaceutical R & D 17 Scholars have argued that ROR , because it allows for consideration of future opportunities , miti - gates undervaluing investments with latent poten - tial . Our ﬁndings suggest that decision - makers do appear in practice to take future opportuni - ties into account , at least when they invest in options . Firms were more likely to invest in new options in areas revealed to be radically differ - ent in scope . Those options with greater scope are also those which are more likely to lead to potentially valuable future growth opportunities . By implication , the taken - for - granted assumption that variance - enhancing potentially radical oppor - tunities are likely to be unattractive to established ﬁrms should be questioned . Established ﬁrms are often characterized as risk - averse , rigid and resis - tant to change . Our study suggests that investing in change through an options lens may offer a path to greater innovation , mitigating organiza - tional rigidity . We also found evidence that decisions to invest in new options were inﬂuenced by the state of the existing portfolio of options in a ﬁrm . The pri - mary implication of this ﬁnding is that assessment ( and logically , quantitative evaluation ) of any sin - gle option is interdependent with the rest of the ﬁrm’s portfolio . Failing to invest in more options in an area diminishes the worth of all previous options in that area because new discoveries with growth potential are less likely . 7 Attractiveness of an established area diminishes a ﬁrm’s propen - sity to invest in additional new areas because of diminishing returns to postponement of exercise in the established area . Because of these effects , investing in new options is not necessarily addi - tive . It is conceivable that adding more options to an existing portfolio can actually decrease its value , not increase it as a simple additive model would assume . Thus , in our thinking and modeling we need to go from assumptions of independence and additivity of new investments to assumptions of interdependence and nonlinear effects . Portfolio effects offer some interesting points of intersection between ROR and theories of orga - nizational learning in strategy . In a highly inﬂu - ential article , March ( 1991 ) argued that ‘balance’ between exploration and exploitation was essen - tial to organizational viability . Our study con - tributes to the burgeoning literature sparked by 7 However , real options are not additive in nature and the drop due to investment may not be linear . March’s paper . We found two different mecha - nisms that appear to inﬂuence ﬁrm investments in new areas . The scope of a new area triggered an exploratory investment response . In contrast , the successful results of past exploration inﬂuenced ﬁrms to respond with less exploratory investing , presumably to focus on the learning they had done that was most vulnerable to diminishing returns and eventual erosion . To the extent that previously opened options have not been exercised or allowed to expire , a ﬁrm is rational to divert resources from the exploration of new options to concluding its investigations of old ones . Options reasoning thus offers insight into the mechanism through which prescriptions for ﬁrms to achieve balance in knowl - edge creation can be translated to actual strategic decision making . We also found explanations consistent with ROR in the way in which ﬁrms responded to com - petitive entry . In the early period of discovery of a new technological area , competitive entry induced investment . The observation that competi - tors have found the arena attractive is likely to lead a decision - maker to adjust expectations for the attractiveness of the area upward as well , mak - ing investments in the area more likely . As players enter , all of them beneﬁt from the net investment into the area and the concomitant reduction in tech - nical uncertainty that this produces . With reduction in uncertainty , however , comes evidence of which options will be ‘in the money’ and which will not . Not all players will be in a position to exercise those options that they have opened . Firms with - out a potential advantage are then likely to exit as a matter of strategic choice ( exercising their option to stop or to redirect ) . Although this pattern has been identiﬁed in previous empirical studies , in which ﬁrms have entered , faced stiff competi - tion , and exited from a ﬁeld ( for instance , Sahlman and Stevenson , 1985 ) , this has mostly been exam - ined at the level of a line of business . Researchers focusing on the business level of analysis have thus developed a different rationale for the pat - tern—namely , entry prompted by high ( and often unrealistic ) expectations of the carrying capacity of an attractive area , with exit prompted by the inability to sustain the business in the face of com - petition . Some important caveats to our conclusions are other explanations that could exist for our results and which should be addressed in future research . For instance , past research has shown that some Copyright  2003 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 25 : 1 – 21 ( 2004 ) 18 R . G . McGrath and A . Nerkar technologies are more accessible than others , lead - ing to simultaneous inventions by multiple inven - tors ( Merton , 1972 ) . Our data set does not per - mit us to analyze such effects but future research , by gathering detailed information on the nature of each sub - area , could begin to examine these effects—speciﬁcally , the extent to which knowl - edge in the area is easily articulated , codiﬁable , and accessible ( Winter , 1987 ) and the extent to which there are network effects on the likelihood of innovation ( Powell , Koput , and Smith - Doerr , 1996 ) . For instance , in the business methods area or software arena where knowledge is articulated , codiﬁed , and accessible , and where the need for complementary assets such as R & D facilities is minimal , one would expect the likelihood of entry to be driven by the extent to which ﬁrms can quickly appropriate rents from such inventions ( Bagby , 2000 ) . Another avenue for research is to develop bet - ter measures of value and variability of value from entering a new area . Our measure of the scope of the opportunity , while a reasonable proxy for the underlying variance , is still crude . Future research could develop alternate measures based on licens - ing or royalty agreements . Finally , we motivate our study by offering a complementary approach to normative investment models borrowed from the ﬁnance ﬁeld . Our intention was to provide evi - dence that investment strategies of pharmaceutical ﬁrms are consistent with ROR . An important topic for future research is to compare the efﬁcacy of these two approaches . Qualitative evidence gath - ered from our ﬁeld studies suggests that the real options approach resonates with the thinking of at least a few R & D managers ( Nichols , 1994b ) . How - ever , more rigorous empirical testing of these two approaches in the R & D context is required before further comparisons are made . ROR , and our study , suggests a different logic for investment within the ﬁrm than that reﬂect - ing conventional assumptions . Based on this logic , we see entry prompted indeed by expectations for future success . Signiﬁcant new investment , how - ever , actually does make the area more valuable by leading multiple ﬁrms to reduce uncertainty and establish a base of knowledge . Entry eventu - ally slows and ceases , not necessarily as a conse - quence of resource pressures , but because the area is now revealed to be differentially attractive to different players . Those for whom the upside is no longer substantial stop making further investments in options in it . An implication for scholars is that the concave function that underlies the relationship between competitive entry and propensity to invest has a different causal explanation for options than for businesses ( which are by deﬁnition more likely to represent commitments , not options ) . The chal - lenge for researchers is not to stop at identifying the pattern and attributing causality ( as is all too often done ) but at identifying the logic underlying the pattern . CONCLUSION In this research , we explored whether actual ﬁrm investment behavior appears consistent with ROR . We thus examined the outcome of ﬁrm - level investment decisions in the pharmaceutical sector over a long period of time ( 17 years ) . Our ﬁndings support the premise that decision - makers either implicitly or explicitly utilize ROR . Our results suggest that the options concept could prove to be a fruitful approach to developing theories of invest - ment in the strategy ﬁeld that are more consistent with observed managerial behavior than those the - ories that rely purely on the assumptions of ﬁnance or economics . Speciﬁcally , we found that decisions to pursue an option on a new technological area ( measured by successful second patents ﬁled in those areas ) are inﬂuenced by the scope of the technological opportunity , the competition in the area , and a ﬁrm’s past investment behavior . To our knowledge , this is one of the ﬁrst studies to empirically test the options premise so extensively . The options approach has implications for im - proving theories in strategy of how managers mat - ter to the creation of competitive advantage . A core idea in ROR is that of making limited - downside , relatively small investments until sufﬁcient uncer - tainty has been reduced to make commitments with greater conﬁdence . One effect is to increase the number of areas that can be explored while decreasing the cost of each exploratory foray . Other things being equal , one might therefore expect that under high levels of uncertainty ﬁrms managed with an options sensibility have greater internal variety than those that do not , improv - ing their chances for both survival and advan - tage under rapidly changing external circumstances ( Ashby , 1956 ) . Options reasoning provides an economic ration - ale for the emergence of performance heterogeneity Copyright  2003 John Wiley & Sons , Ltd . Strat . Mgmt . J . , 25 : 1 – 21 ( 2004 ) Real Options and Pharmaceutical R & D 19 subsequent to the investment in options . By observ - ing how ﬁrms take out options , thus beginning the developmental path for what may turn out to become valuable capabilities , we have speci - ﬁed and measured a point at which management decisions directly inﬂuence capability formation . Moreover , options theory offers an economic ratio - nale for this behavior , tying together powerful con - cepts of future value developed in ﬁnance and the observed incremental - investment behavior of ﬁrms operating under uncertainty . As organizations seek to cope with ever more rapidly moving compet - itive environments , creating new capabilities and doing so in a cost - effective way will become a competitive necessity . By examining the process of investing in real options , such as patents in a new pharmaceutical subclass , we provide a point of departure for better understanding resource - based competitive advantages , because at the time of investment the future beneﬁt is not yet known . Thus , the research presented here offers an exam - ple of an empirical approach strategy researchers might use to respond to the criticism that the ﬁeld relies on post hoc rationalization ( see Cockburn , Henderson , and Stern , 2000 ) . A further theme that is central to ROR but not yet to our theories of strategic investment is the idea that investments in uncertainty reduction erode in value over time . To use the language of options , they expire . Future research on the erosion of option value and the expiration of real options should test whether ﬁrms adopting ROR for invest - ments do let options expire as uncertainty associ - ated with the underlying option is reduced . Fur - ther , if existing resource combinations that under - lie technology investments become commoditized , and options expire at a rapid rate , ﬁrms must be able to rapidly go from exploration of new pos - sibilities to exploiting the commercial potential of those opportunities . In established organizations , such rapid learning and responsiveness is difﬁcult to create as established systems are constructed to yield reliable performance rather than engage in innovative behavior . Our ﬁnding of evidence sup - portive of option expiration , when coupled with the tendency for the products of existing competences and routines to become commoditized , suggests why organizational learning and knowledge man - agement have become a central focus for scholarly attention . ROR offers a perspective from which to develop ideas that are relevant to the problems facing decision - makers in established ﬁrms . We demon - strated that it is possible to derive testable hypothe - ses grounded in ROR and to collect data that can be used to test the hypotheses . The support for our hypotheses suggests that decision - makers in prac - tice ( at least in the U . S . pharmaceutical industry ) deploy a pattern of investment choices that is con - sistent with ROR . As we conclude , it is our hope that real options concepts might offer a useful per - spective for those seeking to develop a theory of investment for the ﬁeld of strategic management .
