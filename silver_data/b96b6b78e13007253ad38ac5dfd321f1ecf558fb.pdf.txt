British Joumal of Cancer ( 1998 ) 78 ( 11 ) , 1442 - 1448 Â© 1998 Cancer Research Campaign Intratumoral infusion of fluid : estimation of hydraulic conductivity and implications for the delivery of therapeutic agents * Y Boucher , C Brekkent , PA Netti , LT Baxter and RK Jain Steele Laboratory , Department of Radiation Oncology , Massachusetts General Hospital , and Harvard Medical School , Boston MA 02114 , USA Summary We have developed a new technique to measure in vivo tumour tissue fluid transport parameters ( hydraulic conductivity and compliance ) that influence the systemic and intratumoral delivery of therapeutic agents . An infusion needle approximating a point source was constructed to produce a radially symmetrical fluid source in the centre of human tumours in immunodeficient mice . At constant flow , the pressure gradient generated in the tumour by the infusion of fluid ( Evans blue - albumin in saline ) was measured as a function of the radial position with micropipettes connected to a servo - null system . To evaluate whether the fluid infused was reabsorbed by blood vessels , infusions were also performed after circulatory arrest . In the colon adenocarcinoma LS174T with a spherically symmetrical distribution of Evans blue - albumin , the median hydraulic conductivity in vivo and after circulatory arrest at a flow rate of 0 . 1 , ul min - ' was , respectively , 1 . 7x1 0 - 7 and 2 . 3x1 0 - 7 cm2 mmHg - ' s . Compliance estimates were 35 gl mmHg - ' in vivo , and 100 , ul mmHg - ' after circulatory arrest In the sarcoma HSTS 26T , hydraulic conductivity and compliance were not calculated because of the asymmetric distribution of the fluid infused . The technique will be helpful in identifying strategies to improve the intratumoral and systemic delivery of gene targeting vectors and other therapeutic agents . Keywords : human tumour xenografts ; intratumoral fluid infusion ; hydraulic conductivity ; compliance ; interstitial fluid pressure Systemic delivery of therapeutic agents to solid tumours is gener - ally hindered by vascular and interstitial barriers ( Sands , 1992 ; Jain , 1993 ) . To circumvent these transport barriers , intratumoral infusions or injections have received increasing interest in recent years ( Order et al , 1994 ; Viola et al , 1995 ; Heise et al , 1997 ; Nomura et al , 1997 ) . While the vascular barrier is circumvented by this route , the interstitial matrix still poses a formidable barrier . Key determinants for the success of intratumoral delivery include the tissue hydraulic conductivity ( K ) and compliance ( C ) . However , there are presently no direct in vivo data for these two parameters in solid tumours . The lack of such measurements is mainly due to experimental difficulties . In normal tissues , resistance to fluid flow is a function of the concentration of interstitial matrix constituents ( glycosaminogly - cans and collagen content ) and the degree of hydration of the matrix ( Swabb et al , 1974 ; Jain , 1987 ; Levick , 1987 ) . K has been estimated mostly under in vitro conditions and in a few studies in vivo . In vitro , K is generally estimated by measuring the flow after applying pressure across a tissue slice of known area and thick - ness . In this case , hydration , slicing of the tissue and compression are potential factors that can influence the determination of K . In vivo estimates of K are also not straightforward , because the char - acterization of tissue dimensions can be difficult . Furthermore , fluid reabsorption by blood vessels or lymphatics may result in an overestimation of K ( Guyton et al , 1966 ; Levick , 1980 ; Netti et al , 1995 ) . Also , K cannot be determined independently in the tran - Received 22 August 1997 Revised 10 March 1998 Accepted 18 March 1998 Correspondence to : Y Boucher sient state of infusion , because C is involved in the process . To uncouple K from C , the measurements for K must be performed in steady - state conditions ( Swabb et al , 1974 ; Ford et al , 1991 ; Tokita and Tanaka , 1991 ) . The goal of the present study was , therefore , to develop a new technique to estimate K in solid tumours , in vivo , at steady state and with a good spatial resolution . To this end , fluid ( Evans blue - albumin in saline ) was infused at low flow rates into the centre of a tumour with a special needle approximating a point source . The pressure increased gradually during fluid infusion and reached a plateau , indicating the attainment of steady state . At steady state , the pressure was measured at known distances from the source with a micropipette connected to a servo - null device . K and C were estimated in tumours with a spherically symmetrical distribution of the fluid infused as determined by the distribution of Evans blue albumin . In the sarcoma HSTS 26T , the distribution of Evans blue was asymmetric . K and C were estimated in LS 1 74T following the confirmation of a spherically symmetrical fluid distribution . C was estimated from the time constant required for the equilibrium of the infusion pressure .

The needle was constructed from a 22 - gauge needle and a thin steel wire . The sharp tip of a 22 - gauge needle was cut and glued to one end of the steel wire . The other end of the steel wire was placed in the 22 - gauge cylinder . A fixed opening of approximately 0 . 7 mm was produced between the tip and cylinder by bending the wire perpendicular to the main axis of the needle . PE 50 tubing was used to stabilize the opening between the tip and cylinder , and for connection with the infusion pump and pressure transducer . B Schematic diagram of the experimental set - up . The point - source needle ( 1 ) was placed in the centre of the tumour ( radius R ) and fluid infused at a constant flow rate . Steady - state radial pressure profiles were measured with high spatial resolution using a glass micropipette ( 2 ) in a region 0 . 3 - 2 . 0 mm from the edge of the infusion needle ( 3 ) were fed sterilized rodent food and water ad libitum . Two human tumours , the colon adenocarcinoma LS 1 74T and the sarcoma HSTS 26T , were implanted subcutaneously in the leg of each mouse . K was estimated when the tumours had reached a volume between 200 and 500 mm3 . Infusion needle To infuse fluid into the centre of a tumour , an infusion needle was constructed to produce a spherically symmetrical fluid source ( Figure 1A ) . A very thin stainless - steel wire ( 35 mm long ) was fixed to the sharp portion ( 2 mm in length ) of a 22 - gauge needle with epoxy glue . The other end of the wire was introduced in the lumen of a 22 - gauge cylinder . A fixed opening of approximately 0 . 7 mm in length between the sharp portion and the 22 - gauge cylinder was produced by bending the wire perpendicular to the main axis of the needle . To fix the opening between the sharp portion and the cylinder , PE - 50 tubing was attached to the cylinder . The needle and the PE 50 tubing were glued to a Plexiglas arm mounted on a graded micromanipulator , which was used for controlling the depth of needle insertion . To measure the pressure of infusion , the needle was connected to the side port of the dome of a pressure transducer ( Statham 23b , Spectramed , Oxnard , CA , USA ) by the PE - 50 tubing , and another side port on the dome was connected by PE 50 tubing to a l - ml syringe controlled by a constant flow infusion pump ( Pump 22 , Harvard Apparatus , South Natick , MA , USA ) . The compliance of the pres - sure transducer infusion pump setup was 0 . 04 , ul mmHg - ' . Pressure measurements The pressure was measured with micropipettes and a servo - null device as previously described previously ( Boucher et al , 1990 ; Boucher and Jain , 1992 ) . To prepare the micropipettes , thick - wall capillary tubing ( 0 . 86 mm outer diameter , 0 . 38 mm inner diam - eter ) was pulled with a micropipette puller . Micropipettes with a tip diameter between 2 and 4 gm were filled by capillarity with a 1 M sodium chloride solution prepared from filtered , distilled , deion - ized water . The micropipettes and the servo - null device were used to measure the baseline interstitial fluid pressure ( IFP ) profiles in the tumour as well as the pressure profiles generated by the low flow rate infusions . A graded micromanipulator was used to insert micropipettes at known depths from the tumour surface . The pressure was measured for periods of 25 - 50 s , once a patent fluid communication between the tissue and micropipette was estab - lished . The following criteria were used to validate the measure - ments : ( a ) the fluid communication between the micropipette and the tissue was confirmed electrically , ( b ) the pressure remained stable after varying the feedback gain of the system and ( c ) the zero pressure in saline at the tumour surface did not change during the measurements . Experimental procedure During fluid infusion into the tumour centre , there is a transient redistribution of fluid . This phenomenon is controlled by K and the C of the tissue . At steady state , the steepness of the pressure profile around the infusion site is controlled by K only . Therefore , it is possible to evaluate K by measuring the pressure profile generated by the intratumoral infusion . The mice were anaesthetized with ketamine / xylazine ( 90 / 10 mg kg - ' ) . During all procedures , mice were placed on a temper - ature - regulated heating pad and the body temperature was main - tained between 36Â°C and 37Â°C . To minimize the deformation of the tumour during the insertion of the infusion needle , a small skin incision was made . The insertion depth of the needle was controlled by the moving arm of a graded micromanipulator . Before the infusion , the baseline IFP in the tumour was measured with micropipettes . To estimate K in LS 174T , 5 % albumin and 0 . 25 % Evans blue in saline ( 0 . 9 % ) were infused at a rate of 0 . 10 or 0 . 14 gl min - ' with the infusion pump . Because of the low compli - ance of HSTS 26T , infusions were made at a flow rate of 0 . 05 Rtl min - ' in that tumour . The steady - state pressure profile induced by the infusion needle was measured with micropipettes ( Figure 1B ) . With a reference mark on the infusion needle , the micropipette was inserted close to the infusion source at an angle of 450 with a graded micromanipulator under stereomicroscopic British Journal of Cancer ( 1998 ) 78 ( 11 ) , 1442 - 1448 0 Cancer Research Campaign 1998 1444 Y Boucher et al Figure 2 Distribution of Evans - blue albumin in HSTS 26T and LS174T tumours after infusions at flow rates of 0 . 05 and 0 . 14 RImin - ' respectively .

The soli , lines represent the monoexponential curves ( P ( a ) = P ( a ) Â±AP ( a ) [ 1 - exp ( - t ' . ) ] ) from a least squares non - linear regression to the experimental data . Note that the time constants of the increase and the decay in pressure were similar ( approximately 10 min ) guidance . The error in the radial position was Â± 20 jm , as deter - mined by the tip of the micropipette touching the tumour surface before and after the measurements . The pressure was measured within a distance of 0 . 3 - 2 . 0 mm from the edge of the infusion cavity . Measurements were not obtained closer to the infusion cavity , because the drop in pressure is very steep in that region . An error in the radial position close to the source would , therefore , lead to a relatively large error in the pressure profile . Furthermore , the region close to the source is characterized by flow irregulari - ties . To evaluate whether tumour blood vessels reabsorbed the fluid infused , K was estimated after circulatory arrest by sacri - ficing the animals . Distribution of the Evans blue - albumin complex The assumption of a spherical distribution of the infusion solution was evaluated following the completion of the measurements . The tumour was cut in the centre , and 2 - 3 mm anterior and posterior to the fluid source . Measurement of water content To evaluate whether the infusion volume significantly modified the water content in the tumour , we compared the water content of tumours infused in vivo and tumours without infusion . After the infusion of 8 , ul of saline , a 3 - mm - thick slice from the infusion region was obtained from the centre of five tumours , and cut to obtain a piece of tissue of 3x3x3 mm . A similar piece of tissue was also obtained from the centre of five tumours that were not infused . The wet weight ( Tw ) was measured immediately after cutting . The dry weight ( Td ) was measured 24 and 48 h after drying at 50Â°C . The tumour water content ( T ) was calculated as [ ( T - Td ) / TW ] x 100 % . Histology At the end of the infusion , the animals were sacrificed . The leg with the tumour was dissected from the animal , being careful not to move the needle in the tumour . The tumours with the needle were placed in fixative solution ( formaldehyde 3 . 5 % , methanol 1 . 5 % ) for 2 - 3 days . To examine the infused area , the tumour was cut in half and two tissue slices ( 2 mm thick ) were then obtained from each side of the central cut . The tissue was processed for histology and embedded in the plastic resin JB4 . Tissue sections ( 1 - 2 gm thick ) were obtained and stained with toluidine blue . Data analysis K was estimated by applying Darcy ' s law for flow through a porous medium ( Baxter and Jain , 1989 ) , British Journal of Cancer ( 1998 ) 78 ( 11 ) , 1442 - 1448 0 Cancer Research Campaign 1998 Hydraulic conductivity of solid tumours 1445 normalized ( viscosity 5 % albumin in isotonic saline / viscosity isotonic saline ) at 20Â°C for comparison with literature values ( Levick , 1987 ) . Furthermore , we estimated tissue compressibility from the time constant of the pressure transients ( Basser , 1992 ) . The time constant was obtained from a least squares non - linear regression of a monoexponential function to the experimental data P ( a ) = P ( a ) , Â± AP ( a ) [ I - exp ( - t / T ) ] Average baseline pressure ( 4 ) where P ( a ) , is the pressure in the infusion cavity , P ( a ) , is the initial pressure in the infusion cavity before a step change in flow rate AP ( a ) is the difference in steady - state pressure and t is the charac - teristic time constant . Compressibility was given by the following formulation 0 . 4 0 . 8 1 . 2 1 . 6 2 2 . 4 2 . 8 Radial position ( mm ) Figure 4 Typical radial pressure profiles measured during infusion at 0 . 1 gl min - 1 into a LS174T xenograft . Two sequential measurements of pressure were made at each spot . The radius of the infusion cavity ( a ) was 0 . 35 mm . The dotted line represents the average interstitial fluid pressure measured before infusion . Errors in IFP and radial position were determined from measurement of zero pressure on the surface and from the surface coordinates respectively . The solid line represents the least squares non - linear regression of the theoretical profile to the experimental data collected during infusion . The theoretical profile used was P ( r ) = PO + ( Q / 4nK ) [ ( 1 / r ) - ( 1 / R ) ] . The value of Kobtained in this tumour was 2 . 3x10 - 7 cm2 / mmHg - 1 s - 1 . Note that the pressure measured in the infusion cavity was not included in the determination of K u = - KVp T = [ 4 4 a2 ] I [ n2 K ] ( 5 ) where 4 is the tissue compressibility ; and a is the radius of the infusion cavity . C was obtained from the product of 4 and the tumour volume . Statistical analysis The data are given as the median and the range . Significant differ - ences between two experimental groups were analysed with the Mann - Whitney U - test . The relationship between parameters were tested with a Spearman correlation . ( 1 ) RESULTS where u is the fluid velocity and Vp is the pressure gradient . Based on the experimental data , the baseline IFP was considered constant throughout the tumour . The radial steady - state pressure profile during infusion was fitted for estimation of K using this Darcy ' s law model P ( r ) = PO + ( Q / 4itK ) [ ( l / r ) - ( 1 / R ) ] ( 2 ) where P ( r ) , is the pressure at radial position r , P0 is the baseline IFP , Q is the constant flow rate and R is the tumour radius . A regional distribution of K was obtained from contiguous points in the induced pressure gradients , using the differential form of the theoretical profile . K = ( Q / 47t ) [ ( r2 - r , ) / r1r2 ] [ P ( r , ) - P ( r2 ) ] ( 3 ) The mean radial position was taken as ( r , + r2 ) / 2 . Only pressure measurements which were 1 mmHg above the baseline plateau pressure were included in the differential analysis . The values of K obtained were considered as average tissue K - values and were To estimate K , we verified the assumption that spherically symmetrical fluid flow occurred . After infusions , the tumours were cut to evaluate the distribution of the Evans blue - albumin complex . In HSTS 26T , the distribution of Evans blue was asym - metric . The non - uniform distribution was observed in the region of infusion or as a significant accumulation of Evans blue separated from the infusion site ( Figure 2A ) . Histological examination of tumour slices revealed that in some tumours the accumulation of Evans blue at some distance from the infusion site was associated with necrotic regions . In other HSTS 26T tumours , the distribution of Evans blue was associated with viable tumour tissue , and it was impossible to characterize the causes of the asymmetric distribution of the Evans blue - albumin complex . In contrast , in LS174T tumours at flow rates of 0 . 1 or 0 . 14 tl min - ' the dye occupied , after approximately 90 min , a circular region of 2 . 5 - 4 . 0 mm in the centre of most tumours , thus confirming the assumption that spherically symmetrical fluid flow occurred ( Figure 2B ) . The main mode of transport was , thus , bulk flow .

The formula used was : K = ( Q / 4n ) [ ( r2 - r1 ) Ir , r2 ] [ P ( rl ) - P ( r2 ) ] . The mean radial position was taken as ( rl + r2 ) / 2 . Note that , at this flow rate , neither in vivo ( 0 ; n = 8 ) nor after CA ( 0 ; n = 7 ) do the data suggest any radial dependence of K arrest . At a flow rate of 0 . 1 , gl min - ' , by both types of analysis , the median K - values were less in vivo compared with circulatory arrest ; however , the differences were not significant ( Table 1 ) . If K was increased by the infusion ( hydration of the tissue ) , the effect could be more pronounced close to the source where the pressure was higher . A linear regression of K ( estimated by differ - ential analysis ) vs distance from the source showed no significant differences in K - values in vivo ( R2 = 0 . 09 ; P > 0 . 1 ) or after circula - tory arrest ( R2 = 0 . 11 ; P > 0 . 8 ) at a flow rate of 0 . lOugl min - ' ( Figure 5 ) . The median water content in the central regions of infused tumours was 83 . 4 % , and 83 . 3 % in tumours that were not infused ; the difference was not significant ( P > 0 . 3 ) . Histological examination of the infusion area also suggested that the intratu - moral infusion at low flow rates used in this study did not alter the organization of the tissue . No pockets of fluid were found in the immediate periphery of the hole left by the needle . The width of the space between tumour cells was comparable in the proximity and at some distance from the infusion cavity . At a flow rate of 0 . 10 Il min - ' , K was apparently not affected by hydration . However , K increased by 80 % at a flow rate of 0 . 14 gl min - ' compared with 0 . 10 ugl min - ' ( Table 1 ) . DISCUSSION diffusion coefficient ( 3 x 107 cm2 s - l ) of albumin in LS174T tumours ( D Berk and RK Jain , unpublished data ) cannot explain the volume of penetration of the Evans blue - albumin complex . Based on a length scale approximation ( ' 4Dt where D is the diffu - sion coefficient and t is time ) , albumin in the LS174T tumour could penetrate by diffusion approximately 0 . 8 mm in 90 min . The data collected in HSTS 26T were not included in the analysis for K and C because of the asymmetric fluid distribution . In previous studies , we have shown that the baseline IFP throughout a tumour is quasi - uniform , except for a sharp pressure drop in the tumour periphery ( Boucher et al , 1990 ; Boucher and Jain , 1992 ) . In the LS 174T tumour , the IFP was also uniform in the centre and dropped close to the surface . The median tumour IFP in vivo was 14 . 0 mmHg ( range 7 - 23 . 5 ) . The placement of the infusion needle in the tumour did not modify the steady - state IFP profiles . Figure 3 shows typical changes in the infusion needle pres - sure in a tumour during infusion in vivo , at a rate of 0 . 10 , ul min - ' . The infusion pressure reached steady state within 25 - 60 min , with a time constant of 7 - 18 min . The pressure profile induced by the infusion was measured at steady state ( Figure 4 ) . At 0 . 3 - 0 . 5 mm from the infusion source , the pressure measured with micropipettes was 3 - 12 mmHg higher than the baseline IFP in the tumour before the infusion . The pressure dropped to the baseline IFP value in the tumours within a radius of 1 - 2 mm from the source . In LS 174T , at a flow rate of 0 . 1 p1l min - ' , median K in vivo was 1 . 7 x 10 - 7 cm2 mmHg - ' s , both by differential analysis and by least squares non - linear regression of the theoretical profile to the measured pressure profile . After circulatory arrest , median K by differential analysis was 2 . 8 x 10 - ' and from a fit to the complete profile 2 . 3 x 10 - 7 ( Table 1 ) . No significant differences were found by estimating K by differential analysis or by fitting the complete profile ( Table 1 ) . Because of the high hydraulic permeability of the tumour vasculature ( Sevick and Jain , 1991 ) , we expected that the fluid infused would be reabsorbed in part by the blood vessels , thus the estimate of K in vivo could be an overestimate . To evaluate whether fluid was reabsorbed , K was measured after circulatory K has been measured with in vitro and in vivo techniques . Two approaches are used to measure K in vitro : the measurement of fluid extrusion from tissue under compression or by applying a pressure head across a tissue slice of known thickness . With in vitro techniques , the influence of compression and hydration on the measurements of K have to be considered ( Levick , 1987 ) . K in vivo is obtained from the measurement of fluid velocity resulting from a natural or an applied pressure gradient ( Guyton et al , 1966 ; Swabb et al , 1974 ; Levick , 1979 ; DiResta et al , 1993 ) . Most in vivo measurements of K are limited by the poor definition of geometric dimensions and by difficulties in separating K from C . The present technique measures with micropipettes the radial pres - sure profile generated by a constant - flow infusion . The resolution provided by micropipettes permits precise determinations of the distance between the infusion source and the tip of the micropipette . Measurements of K in vivo or after circulatory arrest are made at steady state , the contribution of C is , thus , negligible . K can be measured by differential analysis at different radial posi - tions from the infusion needle or by fitting the complete pressure profile . Because the technique is dependent on the spherically symmetrical distribution of the fluid infused , heterogeneity in fluid flow limits the determination of K ( e . g . HSTS 26T tumour ) . Potentially , K could be estimated from the pressure in the infusion needle . This estimation would be less accurate because it is not possible to determine precisely the size of the cavity ( needle radius + tissue displacement ) . A small error in the estimation of this dimension would lead to a big error in the K estimation . A potential limitation of the present and also of previous in vivo techniques estimating K is the possibility that the fluid infused could be reabsorbed by blood or lymphatic vessels ( Guyton et al , 1966 ; Levick , 1980 ) . We addressed the issue of reabsorption by estimating K in vivo and after circulatory arrest . Mellander ( 1960 ) demonstrated that fluid reabsorption in the hind limb microcircula - tion ceased completely within 1 min of circulatory arrest . Recent data suggest that this is also the case in tumours ( Netti et al , 1995 ) . We found in the LS 174T tumour similar values of K in vivo and British Journal of Cancer ( 1998 ) 78 ( 11 ) , 1442 - 1448 10 7 CI , 0 ) I E 0 c ) . 6 Z , 8 6 4 2 0 Cancer Research Campaign 1998 Hydraulic conductivity of solid tumours 1447 after circulatory arrest , thus suggesting that reabsorption of the fluid infused is minimal or zero in the LS174T tumour . A possible reason why reabsorption was not significant in vivo could be because of local properties in the region of the infusion . The infu - sions were done in the tumour centre . Generally , vascular density and blood flow in experimental tumours are reduced in the centre compared with peripheral regions ( Thompson et al , 1987 ; Jirtle , 1988 ; Tozer et al , 1990 ) . However , in the region surrounding the infusion needle , blood vessels were observed on histological slides . In some cases , the blood vessels appeared congested with red blood cells suggesting a stagnant flow . If blood perfusion was stopped in the vicinity of the needle , reabsorption would be minimal and most of the fluid would be transported by bulk flow through the interstitial matrix . The fact that K - values were similar in vivo and after circulatory arrest in LS174T tumours demon - strates that K can be measured in two different types of prepara - tions without being modified . However , this cannot be a general rule , it is possible that in other tumour types K estimates could be significantly different in vivo and after circulatory arrest . If K is estimated in vivo , it should also be measured after circulatory arrest to determine whether reabsorption is significant . Several studies have shown that K is modified by tissue hydra - tion ( Guyton et al , 1966 ; Fatt , 1968 ; Zawieja et al , 1992 ) . At a flow rate of 0 . 10 tl min - , we did not detect any influence of the infusion on K . No significant differences in water content could be found between infused and non - infused tumour tissue . We speculated that hydration and K could be higher when closer to the infusion needle . However , K estimated by differential analysis did not change with distance from the source . At a constant flow of 0 . 14 , tl min - ' , K was 80 % higher than at a flow of 0 . 10Itl min - ' . This increase might be due to reabsorption or hydration . Reabsorption was probably not playing a major role , because the pressures induced at infusion rates of 0 . 10 and 0 . 14 Rl min - ' were similar . In normal tissues , K - values span four orders of magnitude . High K - values have been measured in lung tissue and vitreous body , and lower K - values have been found for cartilage , corneal stroma and subcutaneous tissue ( Levick , 1987 ; Lai Fook et al , 1989 ) . Swabb et al ( 1974 ) reported the first measurements of K for tumour tissue , K in vitro for a slice of rat hepatoma ( 0 . 3 x 107 cm2 / mmHg / s ) was fivefold higher than in normal subcutaneous tissue . Our in vivo values of K ( 1 . 7 x 10 - 7 ) for the colon adenocarcinoma LS 174T are almost sixfold higher than K for slices of rat hepatoma . In another study with the same tumour ( LS 174T ) , we found that K in vitro ( 2 . 4 x 10 - 7 cm2 / mmHg / s ) measured with a flow chamber was comparable to the present in vivo values ( C Znati , Y Boucher and RK Jain , unpublished data ) . Swabb et al ( 1974 ) also estimated Kin vivo by measuring the unsteady flow from micropore chambers embedded in a subcutaneous tumour , and reported values that were tenfold lower than their in vitro values . Because of the uncertainty in the calculations to obtain K , it is possible that their in vivo values were not accurate , as acknowledged by Swabb et al ( 1974 ) . In a recent study , DiResta et al ( 1993 ) calculated from IFP gradi - ents and bulk flow measurements a K - value of 59xlO - 7 cm2 / mmHg / s in a human neuroblastoma transplanted into immuno - deficient animals . Estimation of C and implication for estimation of Lp By estimating K in vivo at steady state with the present technology , it would be possible to estimate other fluid transport parameters . The transient evolution of the infusion pressure ( Figure 3 ) is controlled by the product of C and K ( Ford et al , 1991 ; Basser , 1992 ) . From the estimate of the time constant of this evolution and K , it is possible to estimate compressibility and C ( Table 1 ) . Because these measurements of compressibility and C are highly dependent on the assumptions and the formulation used to calculate them , they have to be considered as first order approximations . A better estimate could be provided by a proper mathematical model that would describe more accurately the transient phenomena . The steepness of the baseline IFP profiles in tumours can be defined by the parameter oc & ( Jain and Baxter , 1988 ; Baxter and Jain , 1989 ) . OC2 = R2 ( L IK ) ( S / V ) where R is the tumour radius , Lp the vascular hydraulic conduc - tivity and S / V surface area per unit tissue volume for transcapillary exchange . By knowing K and obtaining & 2 from measurements of peripheral IFP profiles , Lp could also be estimated . The accuracy of Lp determination will be dependent on careful estimates of SIV and K . Implications for systemic and intratumoral delivery of therapeutic agents The tissue hydraulic conductivity ( K ) is a key determinant of the systemic and intratumoral delivery of therapeutic agents . A rela - tively low K can contribute to the elevated IFP which has been associated with the poor accumulation of macromolecules ( e . g . monoclonal antibodies ) in tumours ( Sands , 1992 ; Jain , 1993 ) . We previously demonstrated that the IFP profiles in experimental tumours were uniform throughout the tumour and dropped steeply in the periphery ( Boucher et al , 1990 ) . In a mathematical model for fluid transport in solid tumours , the ratio of LpIK was identified as a determinant of the steepness of the IFP profiles ( Jain and Baxter , 1988 ; Baxter and Jain , 1989 ) . In a subsequent study , we found that the superficial microvascular pressure was similar to the central IFP , whereas in the tumour periphery the microvascular pressure was significantly higher than the IFP ( Boucher and Jain , 1992 ) . The IFP distribution in tumours suggests that fluid filtration is negligible in the centre and high in the periphery . Because extrava - sation of macromolecules and filtration of fluids are potentially coupled , this could explain the poor accumulation of macromole - cules in the central areas of tumours ( Jain and Baxter , 1988 ; Baxter and Jain , 1989 ) . A large increase in K could reduce the IFP in the centre of tumours and , thus , increase the filtration of fluids and the extravasation of macromolecules . To improve the penetration of monoclonal antibodies , gene vectors and other therapeutic agents in normal or tumour tissues , interstitial infusion methods have been developed ( Bobo et al , 1994 ; Morrison et al , 1994 ; Order et al , 1994 ) The present tech - nique is able to characterize key determinants ( K , compliance , pressure gradients and reabsorption ) that will influence the success of intratumoral infusions . If K is elevated , a uniform distribution of the infused drug throughout the tumour would be expected . However , if K is very low , the enhancement provided by intratu - moral infusion may be less . As K decreases the volume of tissue penetrated by fluid will reduce to a small region around the infu - sion source . Heterogeneity in K or in compliance could result in the asymmetric distribution of therapeutic agents or other mole - cules that are infused into the tumour . Significant differences in the British Journal of Cancer ( 1998 ) 78 ( 11 ) , 1442 - 1448 0 Cancer Research Campaign 1998 1448 Y Boucher et al distribution of Evans blue - albumin were found between HSTS 26T and LS174T tumours . In general , in LS174T tumours the distribution of Evans blue - albumin was uniform , whereas in HSTS 26T tumours the distribution was asymmetric . The asym - metric distribution of Evans blue - albumin in HSTS 26T tumours was observed in viable and necrotic regions . Large deposits of Evans - blue were associated with necrotic regions at distance from the infusion site , thus suggesting that necrotic areas could repre - sent preferential pathways ( higher K ) and sinks for the accumula - tion of therapeutic agents ( Figure 2A ) . The non - uniform distribution of therapeutic agents could significantly limit the success of intratumoral infusions . To increase K , enzymatic degradation of the interstitial matrix could be used . Degradation of the matrix with hyaluronidase increased K by ten - to 20 - fold in muscle fascia ( Day , 1952 ) , and by a factor of 24 in the lung ( Lai Fook et al , 1989 ) . In a preliminary study , we measured K in vivo in two tumours following the intra - tumoral infusion ( 0 . 1 tl min - ' ) of hyaluronidase . By least squares non - linear regression of the measured pressure profile , the values were 7 . 7 x 107 and 11 . 0 x 107 cm2 / mmHg - ' s . These two values are greater than the maximum values of K in the control group ( Table 1 ) . Further studies are needed to evaluate the effect of enzyme digestion on K and on the IFP profiles in solid tumours . In conclusion , we have developed a new technique to estimate K in vivo and after circulatory arrest in tumours with a spherically symmetrical distribution of the fluid infused . The precise spatial resolution of the micropipette technique provides a significant advantage over other techniques for estimating K in vivo . Most importantly the technique can be used to measure and manipulate fluid transport parameters in tumours to improve the delivery of therapeutic agents .
