Results : Dynamin is recruited to membranes by BAR domain proteins , which in turn rely on interaction with dynamin to bind membranes . Conclusion : Membrane binding by dynamin and BAR domain proteins is cooperative and stimulates dynamin and GTP - de - pendent membrane scission . Significance : Our results imply synergy of dynamin and BAR domain proteins to promote GTP - dependent vesicle release . Dynamin mediates various membrane fission events , including thescissionofclathrin - coatedvesicles . Here , weprovidedirectevi - denceforcooperativemembranerecruitmentofdynaminwiththe BIN / amphiphysin / Rvs ( BAR ) proteins , endophilin and amphiphy - sin . Surprisingly , endophilin and amphiphysin recruitment to membranes was also dependent on binding to dynamin due to auto - inhibition of BAR - membrane interactions . Consistent with reciprocalrecruitment invitro , dynaminrecruitmenttotheplasma membrane in cells was strongly reduced by concomitant depletion of endophilin and amphiphysin , and conversely , depletion of dynamin dramatically reduced the recruitment of endophilin . In addition , amphiphysin depletion was observed to severely inhibit clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Furthermore , GTP - dependent membrane scission by dynamin was dramatically elevated by BAR domainproteins . Thus , BARdomainproteinsanddynaminactinsyn - ergyinmembranerecruitmentandGTP - dependentvesiclescission . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) 4 is a major cellular pathway for synaptic vesicle recycling , receptor internalization , and the uptake of extracellular nutrients ( 1 ) . It relies on the concerted action of numerous proteins , many of which bind to membranes and sense or induce bilayer morphology changes . BIN / amphiphysin / Rvs ( BAR ) domain - containing proteins have been proposed to recruit dynamin to the neck regions of forming clathrin - coated pits via their SRC homology 3 ( SH3 ) domains that bind to the C - terminal proline - rich domain ( PRD ) of dynamin ( 2 – 4 ) . Theyarealsoimplicatedinmembranesculptingoftheneck regions and thereby forming a template for dynamin oligomeriza - tion ( 5 ) . A mutant of dynamin lacking the PRD remains cytosolic in cells ( 3 ) but can still oligomerize in vitro on negatively charged membranes ( 6 ) , suggesting that dynamin oligomerization is facil - itated in vivo by proteins binding to its PRD . Amphiphysin and endophilin are two prominent contenders . Both have a similar domain organization containing an N - BAR domain and an SH3 domain ( 7 , 8 ) thatbindstothePRDofdynamin ( 9 , 10 ) . Inaddition , amphiphysin also binds to AP2 and clathrin ( 11 , 12 ) . Overexpres - sion of the amphiphysin SH3 domain inhibits transferrin endocy - tosis , a defect that can be rescued by overexpression of dynamin but not by an SH3 - binding - deficient mutant of dynamin ( 12 , 13 ) . Injection of amphiphysin SH3 domain also inhibits clathrin - coated pit scission in lamprey synapses and in epithelial cells ( 14 , 15 ) . Endophilin is also implicated in synaptic vesicle retrieval ( 10 , 16 – 18 ) and was found to accumulate at the necks of invagi - nated vesicles in dynamin knock - out ( KO ) cells ( 19 ) . In addi - tion , it has been shown that endophilin forms a pre - scission complex with dynamin in lamprey synapses ( 20 ) . Both amphiphysin and endophilin form complexes with dynamin on membranes ( 21 , 22 ) . Another protein proposed to be involved in CME is sorting nexin 9 ( SNX9 ) ( 23 , 24 ) . It has a BAR and an SH3 domain that binds to dynamin . The involvement of BAR domain proteins in dynamin activ - ity is implied from the direct interaction with dynamin ( 21 , 22 ) , * This work was supported by the Medical Research Council File Reference U105178805 , a Human Frontiers Science Program Fellowship ( to M .

MARCH 1 , 2013• VOLUME 288•NUMBER 9 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 6651 the modulation of dynamin’s GTPase activity by these interac - tions ( 25 , 26 ) , and the coincidence of their recruitment and that of dynamin to sites of vesicle scission ( 27 ) . However , the role of these BAR domain proteins in dynamin recruitment has remained an inference , which we now investigate . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell Culture , RNAi , and Fixed - and Live - cell Fluorescent Microscopy —SK - MEL - 2 DNM2 en - all - eGFP and DNM2 en - all - eGFP CLTA en - all - RFP genome - edited cells ( 28 ) were cultured in DMEM / F - 12 Ham’s ( 1 : 1 v / v ) , 0 . 25 % sodium bicarbonate ( w / v ) , 1 m M GlutaMAX , and 10 % FBS . Approximately 2 (cid:2) 10 5 or 2 . 5 (cid:2) 10 4 cells were cultured on 35 - mm glass bottom dishes ( MatTek ) or 13 - mm coverslips , respectively . Cells were transfected twice ( on day 1 and 2 ) with Oligofectamine ( Invitrogen ) with a total of 80 pmol of each indicated siRNA and analyzed on day 4 ( 72 h after the first transfection ) . The siRNAs used were as follows : Amph1 (cid:3) 2 pool 1 , HSS100465 ( two oligos against human amphiphysin1 , Invit - rogen ) and 4392420 s1341 ( one oligo against human amphiphysin2 ( BIN1 ) , Ambion ) ; Amph1 (cid:3) 2 pool 2 , HSS100466 ( two oligos against human amphiphysin1 , Invitro - gen ) and 4392420 s1342 ( one oligo against human amphiphy - sin2 ( BIN1 ) , Ambion ) ; Amph1 (cid:3) 2 pool 3 , HSS100467 ( two oli - gos against human amphiphysin1 , Invitrogen ) and 4392420 s1343 ( one oligo against human amphiphysin2 ( BIN1 ) , Ambion ) ; EndoA1 (cid:3) 2 (cid:3) 3 pool 1 , L - 012597 ( four oligos against human endophilinA1 , Dharmacon ) , L - 019582 ( four oligos against human endophilinA2 , Dharmacon ) , and L - 015728 ( four oligos against human endophilinA3 , Invitrogen ) ; EndoA1 (cid:3) 2 (cid:3) 3 pool 2 , HSS109708 ( two oligos against human endophilinA1 , Invitrogen ) , HSS109705 ( two oligos against human endophilinA2 , Invitrogen ) , and HSS109711 ( two oligos against human endophilinA3 , Invitrogen ) ; EndoA1 (cid:3) 2 (cid:3) 3 pool 3 , HSS109709 ( two oligos against human endophilinA1 , Invit - rogen ) , HSS109706 ( two oligos against human endophilinA2 , Invitrogen ) , and HSS109712 ( 2 oligos against human endo - philinA3 , Invitrogen ) ; SNX9 siRNA - 1 , HSS122185 ( two oligos against human SNX9 , Invitrogen ) ; SNX9 siRNA - 2 , HSS122186 ( two oligos against human SNX9 , Invitrogen ) , SNX9 siRNA - 3 , HSS122187 ( two oligos against human SNX9 , Invitrogen ) ; SNX9 pool , HSS122185 , HSS122186 , and HSS122187 ( a total of six oligos against human SNX9 , Invitrogen ) ; DNM1 (cid:3) 2 pool 1 , HSS176208 ( two oligos against human dynamin1 , Invitrogen ) and J - 004007 - 06 ( one oligo against human dynamin2 , Thermo Scientific ) ; DNM1 (cid:3) 2 pool 2 , HSS102821 ( two oligos against human dynamin1 , Invitrogen ) and J - 004007 - 08 ( one oligo against human dynamin2 , Thermo Scientific ) . Control samples were transfected in the same way as the RNAi samples but a scrambled control siRNA oligo ( Invitrogen ) was used instead . In some experiments , cells were transfected using Lipofectamine2000 ( Invitrogen ) using 0 . 05 to 0 . 2 (cid:2) g or 1 (cid:2) g ( overexpression experiments ) of amphiphysin1 - eGFP , amphiphysin1 - TagRFP - T , amphiphysin2 - eGFP , amphiphy - sin2 - TagRFP - T , TagRFP - T - SNX9 , endophilinA2 - eGFP , or endophilinA2 - TagRFP - T ( all human ) . Cells were incubated for 24 h to express the constructs before imaging . Cells were imaged live directly or fixed ( 3 . 7 % paraformaldehyde , 20 min at room temperature ) and stained using goat anti - endophilin ( S - 15 ) ( sc10880 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , rabbit anti - endo - philin ( H - 60 ) ( sc - 25495 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , and don - key anti - goat Alexa - 546 or goat anti - rabbit Alexa - 546 ( Molec - ular Probes ) and mounted on slides using 1 , 4 - diazobicyclo - [ 2 , 2 , 2 ] - octane . Just before live - cell imaging , the medium was changed to minimum Eagle’s medium without phenol red , sup - plemented with 20 m M HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , and 5 % FBS , and placed into a temperature - controlled chamber on the microscope stage with 95 % air , 5 % CO 2 and 100 % humidity . Live - cell imag - ing was performed as in Ref . 29 . Briefly , live - cell and fixed - cell imaging data were acquired using a fully motorized inverted microscope ( Eclipse TE - 2000 , Nikon ) equipped with a CSU - X1 spinning disk confocal head ( Ultraview Vox , PerkinElmer Life Sciences ) using a (cid:2) 60 lens ( Plan Apochromat VC , 1 . 4 NA , Nikon ) under control of Volocity 5 . 0 ( Improvision , UK ) . 14 - Bit digital images were obtained with a cooled EMCCD camera ( 9100 – 02 , Hamamatsu , Japan ) . Two 50 milliwatt solid - state lasers ( 488 and 561 ; Crystal Laser and Melles Griots ) coupled to an individual acoustic - optical tunable filter were used as the light source to excite eGFP and TagRFP - T or Alexa - 546 as appropriate . Dynamin en levels at the plasma membrane ( Fig . 1 , B and E ) were measured by summing the fluorescence signals on at least 10 , 000 (cid:2) m 2 of cell membrane from snapshots at various times along live - cell imaging time lapses . Lifetimes of dynamin en were measured on kymographs . Please note that endogenous dynamin is detected for a longer time than transiently expressed versions ( 28 ) . Relative levels of BAR domain proteins at the plasma membrane ( Fig . 1 , F and H ) correspond to the sum of the fluorescence intensities of at least 100 punctae , nor - malized to the control levels . Transferrin Uptake and Flow Cytometry —Approximately 1 (cid:2) 10 6 RPE1 cells grown in 100 - mm dishes were transfected twice ( on day 1 and 2 ) with Oligofectamine ( Invitrogen ) with a total of 600 pmol of the indicated siRNA and analyzed on day 4 ( 72 h after the first transfection ) . AlexaFluor - 488 - labeled human transferrin ( Molecular Probes , used at 20 (cid:2) g / ml ) uptake was carried at 37 °C for 7 min . Cells were then washed with ice - cold PBS , detached by a 1 - min incubation with 0 . 25 % trypsin / EDTA , spun , acid - washed ( ice - cold buffer , pH 5 , to remove surface - bound ligand ) , washed , fixed ( paraformaldehyde 3 . 7 % for 20 min ) , washed , and resus - pended in PBS and analyzed using LSR II flow cytometer ( BD Biosciences ) . Flow cytometry provided similar phenotypes than those obtained by classical microscopy - based measurement of ligand uptake but allowed an increase in at least 2 log in the number of cells analyzed . Generation of Giant Unilamellar Vesicles —1 - (cid:2) l drops of lipid mixtures ( 50 mol % Folch Avanti Polar Lipids ( Avanti ) , 40 mol % Folch Sigma ( Sigma ) , 5 mol % 1 - palmitoyl - 2 - oleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phospho - l - serine ( Avanti ) , and 4 mol % phosphati - dylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( Avanti ) , 1 mo % rhodamine - PE ( Avanti ) ) were applied to indium / tin oxide - covered glass slides . A GUV generation chamber was assembled by separating two slides by a 400 m M glucose solution and thin rubber spacer . We adjusted a previously described electro - formation protocol ( 30 ) Membrane Recruitment of Dynamin and BAR Domain Proteins 6652 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 288•NUMBER 9• MARCH 1 , 2013 so that an electrical field ( AC ) was applied for 195 min at 55 °C ( 45 min , 0 . 1 – 1 . 4 V at 10 Hz ; 120 min , 1 . 4 V at 10 Hz ; 30 min , 2 . 1 V at 4 . 5 Hz ) . GUVs were freshly prepared for each experiments and used immediately . Giant Unilamellar Vesicle Assays —Experiments were car - ried out using the spinning - disc confocal microscope described above . Reactions took place in a 250 - (cid:2) l chamber ( Lab - Tek , Borosilicate ) . To avoid disruption of the GUVs on contact , the chamber was coated with BSA . 50 (cid:2) l of GUV solution ( 400 m M sucrose , 20 m M HEPES , pH 7 . 4 ) was added to 150 (cid:2) l of buffer ( 200 m M NaCl , 20 m M HEPES , pH 7 . 4 ) . Osmolalities of the GUV solution and the buffer were matched to the osmolalities of the protein solutions . Proteins were added using a 50 - (cid:2) l Hamilton syringe with a bent tip . Protein concentrations are indicated in the figure legends , but these are likely overestimates , as the protein tends to coat the walls of the incubation chamber , as seen from the increasing fluorescent signal . To avoid disruption of the GUVs , the solution was mixed by gentle rotation of a pipette tip . If GTP was used , 100 (cid:2) M MgCl 2 was mixed into the buffer before GUVs were added . All experiments were carried out at 37 °C . Cloning and Protein Purification —Full - length rat amphiphy - sin 2 – 6 and full - length rat endophilin A1 were cloned into pGEX - 6P2 . Proteins were expressed in BL21 cells for 1 h at 37 °C for amphiphysin and 16 h at 18 °C for the remaining pro - teins . Cells were lysed using Emulsiflex C3 and spun at 40 , 000 rpm for 40 min at 4 °C in a Beckman Ti45 rotor , and the super - natant was bound to glutathione beads for 30 min . The beads were washed extensively with 150 m M NaCl , 20 m M HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , 2 m M DTT , 2 m M EDTA , with two washes at 500 m M NaCl in between . The GST tag was cleaved using PreScission prote - ase . Cleaved proteins were further purified by Superdex 200 gel filtration . Full - length rat dynamin 1 was cloned into pET15b . The SH3 domain of rat amphiphysin 2 ( 13 ) was cloned into pGEX - 4T2 . Proteins were expressed in BL21 cells for 16 h at 18 °C . Cell pellets were mixed in a ratio of 1 liter of amphiphysin SH3 to 6 liters of dynamin . Cells were lysed using Emulsiflex C3 and spun at 125 , 000 (cid:2) g for 40 min at 4 °C in a Beckman Ti45 rotor , and the supernatant was bound to glutathione beads for 30 min . The beads were washed extensively with 300 m M NaCl , 20 m M Tris , pH 8 . 5 , 2 m M DTT , 2 m M EDTA . Proteins were eluted with free glutathione and bound to Q - Sepharose at 150 m M NaCl and eluted with a salt gradient to 1 M NaCl . Fractions containing dynamin alone were pooled and concentrated . Protein was fur - ther purified by Superdex 200 gel filtration . Dynamin 1 (cid:4) PRD was cloned into pET15b with a PrSc cleav - age site after Thr - 752 . Overexpression and purification were done according to full - length dynamin protocol until the beads were washed . Protein was then eluted by adding PrSc protease to the beads and further purified by Superdex 200 gel filtration . Protein Labeling —Proteins were labeled with Alexa dyes using commercially available labeling kits ( Alexa - 488 and Alexa - 647 protein labeling kits from Invitrogen ) . Co - sedimentation Assays —Liposomes had the same compo - sition as GUVs excluding rhodamine - PE . Lipids were mixed and dried under a stream of argon . To get rid of the remaining solvents , lipids were desiccated for 2 h . Buffer was added to give a final concentration of 1 mg / ml liposomes . Liposomes were re - hydrated for 1 h followed by five freeze - thaw cycles . Lipo - somes were extruded 21 times through a 100 - nm filter ( Nucleo - pore , Track - Etch , Whatman ) and used immediately . Lipo - somes were incubated with 1 (cid:2) M of the protein ( s ) indicated in the figures . After 20 min at 37 °C , the liposomes were centri - fuged at 150 , 000 (cid:2) g for 20 min . Supernatants and pellets were separated , and equal amounts of each were loaded onto an SDS gel . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Mutual Recruitment of Dynamin and BAR Domain Proteins in Live Cells —The role of BAR domain proteins thought to recruit dynamin to clathrin - coated pits was assessed in a genome - edited skin fibroblast cell line ( SK - MEL - 2 ) having all endogenous clathrin and dynamin2 molecules tagged with red fluorescent protein and eGFP , respectively ( 28 ) . Depletion of amphiphysin ( Amph1 (cid:3) 2 ) by RNA interference ( RNAi ) led to an increased and prolonged dynamin recruitment to the plasma membrane ( Fig . 1 , A – C ) . The increased dynamin recruitment is consistent with the known action of amphiphysin in preventing dynamin assembly into larger structures in vitro ( 13 ) . The result also implies that other proteins in addition to amphiphysin are involved in dynamin recruitment . Consistently , amphiphysin RNAi led to defective CME as measured by transferrin ( Tf ) uptake ( Fig . 1 , D and E ) . This strong dependence of CME on amphiphysin is in line with Saccharomyces cerevisiae amphiphysin homologues , with Rvs164 / 167 being important for endocytosis and observed on the necks of endocytic struc - tures ( 31 , 32 ) . The severity is less consistent with the weak endocytic phenotype of knock - out ( KO ) mice for amphiphy - sin1 , where amphiphysin2 expression levels are seen to be con - comitantly decreased and where synaptic vesicle recycling defects are only observed with strong stimulations ( 33 ) . How - ever , residual amphiphysin2 in these mice is likely to be functional . Endophilin is also proposed to be involved in dynamin recruitment to the plasma membrane . Depletion of endophilin ( EndoA1 (cid:3) 2 (cid:3) 3 ) induced a small decrease in dynamin recruit - ment , a slight increase in dynamin lifetime at clathrin - coated pits , but no significant decrease in Tf uptake ( Fig . 1 , B – E , and supplemental Fig . S1 A ) . Consistent with the observation that SNX9 is recruited after dynamin , endophilin , and amphiphysin ( 27 ) , RNAi of SNX9 did not result in detectable changes in dynaminlevelsattheplasmamembranenorinTfuptakedecrease ( Fig . 1 , A – E , and supplemental Fig . S1 A ) , and thus it is unlikely to mediate dynamin recruitment at clathrin - coated pits . The concomitant knockdown of both endophilin and amphiphysin , however ( EndoA1 (cid:3) 2 (cid:3) 3 (cid:3) Amph1 (cid:3) 2 RNAi , supplemental Fig . S2 ) , induced a significant diminution of dynamin recruitment to the plasma membrane ( Fig . 1 , A and B ) as well as a marked reduction in Tf uptake ( Fig . 1 , D and E ) . Although overexpression of individual full - length BAR (cid:3) SH3 domain proteins promoted dynamin recruitment to mem - branes in cells ( Fig . 1 , F and G , and supplemental Fig . S1 B ) , a significant reduction of dynamin recruitment required the depletion of multiple proteins , implying redundancy between them ( Fig . 1 B ) . Membrane Recruitment of Dynamin and BAR Domain Proteins MARCH 1 , 2013• VOLUME 288•NUMBER 9 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 6653 Given the altered dynamin recruitment with BAR protein depletion , we asked if the plasma membrane localization of BAR (cid:3) SH3 domain - containing proteins could be altered by decreased dynamin levels . When testing BAR domain protein recruitment to the plasma membrane upon dynamin depletion ( DNM1 (cid:3) 2 RNAi ) , we saw that amphiphysin and SNX9 recruit - ment was unchanged ( Fig . 1 H and supplemental Fig . S1 B ) , con - sistent with their additional binding to AP2 and clathrin through their middle domains ( 11 , 23 ) . In the case of amphiphysin , these interactions have been shown to mediate recruitment , as mutations of this region ( 11 , 34 ) or acute per - turbation of its interaction with clathrin using the small mole - cule pitstop2 ( 35 ) were enough to render the protein cytosolic ( Fig . 1 , I and J , and supplemental Fig . S1 D ) . Pitstop2 had no FIGURE 1 . Recruitment of dynamin and of BAR domain proteins in live cells .

Membrane Recruitment of Dynamin and BAR Domain Proteins 6654 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 288•NUMBER 9• MARCH 1 , 2013 effect on endophilin recruitment ( Fig . 1 J and supplemental Fig . S1 D ) . Neither RNAi of amphiphysin nor addition of pitstop2 prevents dynamin recruitment to sites of CME ( Fig . 1 , B and J ) , yet in both cases the lack of amphiphysin at clathrin - coated pits does not allow for functional vesicle scission , implying that amphiphysin plays a key role in the precise localization of dynamin and / or its function . Finally , dynamin depletion led to a clear reduction of endo - philin recruitment to the plasma membrane ( Fig . 1 , F and G , and supplemental Fig . S1 , B and C ) . This indicates a degree of cooperativity of dynamin and endophilin binding to the mem - brane , as endophilin displays no direct clathrin interaction as an alternative means for recruitment . We next asked if we could investigate cooperative recruitment of BAR domain proteins and dynamin to membranes in vitro . Dynamin Recruitment to Membranes Is Facilitated by Endo - philin and Amphiphysin —Membrane localization and the assay of CME in cells show a strong relationship between BAR proteins and dynamin . However , to gain a more precise molec - ular understanding , we developed a system with reduced com - plexity . We have therefore reconstituted the activities of these proteins on membranes in vitro . Membrane binding of endo - cytic proteins has classically been shown with spin or flotation assays using small unilamellar vesicles . We considered small unilamellar vesicles an inadequate membrane model system to study dynamin recruitment , because dynamin recruitment to small unilamellar vesicles is robust even in the absence of inter - action partners ( 36 ) . This may be due to enhanced polymeriza - tion of dynamin on membranes of high curvature ( 5 ) . Thus , to visualize dynamin recruitment to membranes , we employed GUVs , which present a virtually flat surface at the protein scale . Shortly after the addition of Alexa - 488 - labeled dynamin , we observed almost no dynamin recruitment to GUVs ( Fig . 2 A , upper panel ) . However , within 30 min , a strong dynamin signal was seen on the membrane ( Fig . 2 , A , bottom panel , B and C ) . This suggested the possibility that GUVs represent a suitable model membrane system to study potential factors involved in dynamin recruitment . Addition of labeled endophilin to the assay accelerated the recruitment of dynamin to GUV mem - branes ( Fig . 2 D ) , as seen also in time courses ( Fig . 2 , E and F ) . Co - recruitment experiments with dynamin and amphiphysin showed comparable results ( Fig . 2 , G and H ) , consistent with earlier results showing an increased rate of GTP hydrolysis by dynamin on membranes in the presence of amphiphysin ( 26 ) . The addition of endophilin not only led to a more efficient membrane binding of dynamin but also to clustering of both proteins on the membrane ( Fig . 2 D , arrows , and supplemental Movie 1 ) . Such protein clusters were not observed in experi - ments with dynamin alone ( Fig . 2 A ) or with dynamin in the presence of amphiphysin ( Fig . 4 ) . This observation fits with earlier experiments showing that amphiphysin disassembles dynamin oligomers ( 13 ) , whereas endophilin more strongly promotes dynamin assembly ( 20 ) . From these initial experi - ments , we conclude that BAR (cid:3) SH3 proteins promote a more efficient recruitment of dynamin to membranes , and given the variety of these proteins , with various membrane specificities , this should facilitate specific dynamin recruitment to many dif - ferent membrane scission events . Endophilin and Amphiphysin Recruitment to Membranes Depends on the PRD of Dynamin —Surprisingly , when changing the order of protein addition , we did not detect the recruitment of full - length endophilin to membranes in the absence of dynamin ( Fig . 3 A ) . This is similar to our observation in cells where RNAi of dynamin led to a reduced recruitment of endo - philin ( Fig . 1 , D and F ) . The in vitro system allowed this to be further probed . The N - BAR module alone of endophilin was efficiently recruited ( Fig . 3 B ) , ruling out any potential interfer - ence of protein and lipid labeling with membrane binding and implying that membrane binding of full - length endophilin is auto - inhibited by its cognate SH3 domain . Addition of endo - philin N - BAR in many cases also led to visible tubulation of GUVs ( Fig . 4 A ) . When dynamin was added to full - length endo - philin , both proteins were recruited to GUV membranes within seconds ( Fig . 3 C ) . To further test for auto - inhibition , we per - formed a series of co - sedimentation assays with SUVs ( Fig . 3 D ) . Endophilin N - BAR domain efficiently bound to SUVs , as expected , whereas membrane binding was decreased for full - length endophilin . Almost complete membrane binding was restored in the presence of dynamin PRD ( Fig . 3 D ) that is known to bind to the SH3 domain of endophilin ( 10 ) . It is tempting to speculate that the stronger membrane binding of full - length endophilin to SUVs might be due to the higher cur - vature of the small vesicles serving as a binding template or to an increased membrane tension of the GUVs due to the high sucrose concentration within the vesicles . On GUVs , the addition of dynamin lacking its PRD ( dynamin (cid:4) PRD ) did not induce endophilin membrane bind - ing , although full - length dynamin did ( Fig . 3 E , top and middle panels ) . Addition of the PRD from dynamin was sufficient to restore endophilin membrane binding , demonstrating that occupying the SH3 domain of endophilin can reverse its auto - inhibited state . To investigate if this is a general mechanism to regulate membrane binding of N - BAR domain proteins , we performed a similar set of experiments with amphiphysin ( Fig . 4 ) , and we found the same regulatory mechanism . Membrane recruitment of dynamin and endophilin / am - phiphysin is thus observed to be cooperative . Dynamin needs a critical concentration for self - polymerization . This can be arti - ficially achieved by increasing the strength of this interaction ( low ionic strength buffers ) or by using negatively charged membranes with high curvature as a template ( 36 , 37 ) . In a more physiological context , N - BAR domains can likely cooper - ate with dynamin to make a template for assembly , and in addi - tion , the BAR domain of amphiphysin / endophilin will form a strong dimer in the context of membranes , thus providing two SH3 domains for recruiting dynamin dimers , providing a sig - nificant dynamin affinity for relieving the auto - inhibition of the amphiphysin in the first place . The involvement of SH3 domains in the regulation of amphiphysin , endophilin , and syndapin ( also called pacsin ) has been noted previously ( 38 , 39 ) . For endophilin and amphiphy - sin , cognate SH3 domains are proposed to form intramolecular interaction with proline - rich sequences between the BAR and SH3 domains . For pacsins , the BAR domain is suggested as the site of SH3 binding ( 39 ) , but a functional consequence on mem - Membrane Recruitment of Dynamin and BAR Domain Proteins MARCH 1 , 2013• VOLUME 288•NUMBER 9 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 6655 brane binding was not uncovered . Here , we establish for endo - philin and amphiphysin that their SH3 domains directly inhibit membrane binding , pointing to the BAR domain as the most likely site for the SH3 interaction . In addition , we show that the N - BAR domain alone of endophilin recapitulates the binding of full - length endophilin (cid:3) the PRD of dynamin . The exact site of this interaction has not been mapped in this study .

Membrane Recruitment of Dynamin and BAR Domain Proteins MARCH 1 , 2013• VOLUME 288•NUMBER 9 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 6657 Membrane Recruitment of Dynamin and BAR Domain Proteins 6658 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY VOLUME 288•NUMBER 9• MARCH 1 , 2013 dynamin structures propose a mechanism of how GTP hydro - lysis could be coupled to membrane scission ( 40 , 41 ) , and a very recently published model is taking physical parameters of the membrane into account ( 42 ) . Although our assay does not allow us to test for possible scission mechanisms , we can ask the following question . What is the likely consequence of coopera - tive membrane binding on dynamin - dependent membrane scission ? It has been shown in the past that dynamin is sufficient to release small vesicles from membrane templates in a GTP - dependent manner ( 6 , 43 ) , and dynamin is capable of causing scission of membrane tethers ( 44 , 45 ) . Using GUVs , we observed that addition of dynamin resulted in sporadic tubular structures on the vesicle surfaces and that those structures were released in response to GTP addition ( results not shown ) . How - ever , these events were rather infrequent , and thus we asked if we would see a difference in the presence of BAR domain pro - teins . In the presence of dynamin and endophilin , GUVs were stable for hours ( Fig . 5 A , (cid:7) GTP ) . However , subsequent addi - FIGURE5 . GTP - dependentvesiclereleaseleadstoshrinkageofparentGUVs .

Membrane Recruitment of Dynamin and BAR Domain Proteins MARCH 1 , 2013• VOLUME 288•NUMBER 9 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 6659 tion of GTP led to a visible release of small vesicles from the GUVs ( Fig . 5 A , arrows ) . Following the same GUV over a longer period of time revealed a significant volume reduction ( Fig . 5 A , 60 min ) , most likely due to the continuous release of small ves - icles and the consumption of the GUV . Because it was neither possible to reliably quantify by micros - copy the number and rate of released vesicles nor to separate or purify them biochemically from the rather fragile GUVs , we used the GUV shrinkage rate as a robust readout of vesiculation under different conditions ( Fig . 5 , B and C ) . GUVs alone were stable for hours . After incubation with dynamin for 30 min ( to allow for the slow recruitment ) , we observed sporadic tubules on GUVs , which over time led to marginal changes of the GUV diameter . The addition of GTP to membrane - bound dynamin resulted in some vesicle release and a minor shrinkage of GUVs ( Fig . 5 , B and C , GUV (cid:3) Dyn (cid:3) GTP ) . The GUV shrinkage was dramatically increased if GTP was added to vesicles loaded with dynamin and either endophilin or amphiphysin ( Fig . 5 , B and C ) . Addition of GTP (cid:1) S did not lead to visible changes ( Fig . 5 D ) . We conclude that amphiphysin and endophilin promote GTP - dependent membrane scission . Assuming the release of 10 - nm vesicles , a decrease in the GUV diameter from 10 to 5 (cid:2) m over 60 min will result from the release of between 5000 and 10 , 000 vesicles , or at least 1 – 2 vesicles / s . To ask if the promotion of membrane scission is a result of enhanced recruitment or if the BAR protein may be participat - ing in the scission event , we used a small peptide inhibitor of dynamin - amphiphysin interactions . The P4 peptide is derived from the amphiphysin - binding site in dynamin ( sequence , QVPSRPNRAP ) ( 4 , 13 ) and has been used in cells to disrupt endocytic activity ( 46 , 47 ) . Addition of P4 caused the release of amphiphysin ( bound in the presence of dynamin ) from GUVs , but the dynamin signal was not diminished ( Fig . 4 D ) . GUVs now showed no shrinkage after GTP addition ( Fig . 5 E ) , showing that vesicle scission is dependent on the presence of all three components , dynamin , GTP , and amphiphysin . Our results show that N - BAR proteins are indeed necessary for dynamin recruitment and activity . We propose that both the enhanced recruitment and the regulation of dynamin activity in the presence of N - BAR proteins explain the importance of these proteins in vivo . We see that depletion of amphiphysin or blocking its recruitment to clathrin - coated pits are both effec - tive ways to inhibit CME . The inhibition of amphiphysin recruitment observed upon treatment with pitstop2 , a small molecule previously shown to inhibit CME ( 35 ) , points to the importance of amphiphysin in membrane scission and in the regulation of dynamin activity . Our results are consistent with a view of CME as a network of interactions where the membrane scission molecule , dynamin , is recruited by proteins that themselves aid in making the neck tem - plate and in addition are synergistically regulated by dynamin .
