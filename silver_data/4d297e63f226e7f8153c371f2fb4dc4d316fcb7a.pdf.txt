Analysis of three - node motifs ( triads ) was used in this paper to track the temporal changes in the structure of large social network derived from email communication between the employees of Wroclaw University of Technology . 1 . Introduction A biased distribution of local network structures , a . k . a . network motifs is widely observed in complex biological or technology - based networks . In this paper network motifs were used to track temporal changes in the local structure of large email – based social network of the Wroclaw University of Technology ( WUT ) , consisting of over 5 , 700 nodes and 140 , 000 edges . The local structure of this network has been investigated by analyzing three node motifs ( triads ) . The rest of the paper is structured as follows : section 2 introduces the motifs and their existing applications in network analysis . Section 3 briefly presents former results obtained for the social network of WUT . Section 4 presents the results of temporal analysis , while section 5 summarizes the work and defines the next research steps . 2 . Related work The analysis of both biological and engineered , networks with respect to so – called network motifs was first presented in [ 10 ] . The motifs are small ( usually 3 to 7 nodes in size ) subgraphs that occur in the given network far more ( or less ) often then in the equivalent ( in terms of the number of nodes and edges ) random networks . Despite all structural and statistical similarities , networks from different fields have very different local topological structure . It was recently shown that concentration of network motifs may help to distinguish and classify complex biological , technical and social networks . We can define so – called superfamilies of networks [ 9 ] , which correspond to the specific significance profiles ( SP s ) . To create a SP for the given network , the concentration of individual motifs is measured and compared to their concentration in a number of random networks . The statistical significance of motif M is usually defined by its Z – score measure Z M : randM randM M M n n Z (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:4) ( 1 ) where n M is the frequency of motif M in the given network , randM n and randM (cid:2) are the mean and standard deviation of M ’s occurrences in the set of random networks , respectively [ 3 ] . Most algorithms for detecting network motifs assume exhaust enumeration of all subgraphs with a given number of nodes in the network . Their computational cost dramatically increases with the network size . However , it was recently shown that it is possible to use random sampling in order to effectively estimate concentrations of network motifs . The algorithm presented in [ 5 ] is asymptotically independent of the network size and enables fast detection of motifs in very large networks with hundreds of thousands of nodes and larger . The existence of network motifs affects not only topological but also functional properties of the network . For biological networks , it was suggested that network motifs play key information processing roles [ 11 ] . For example , so – called FFL motif – Feed – Forward Loop ( motif no . 5 in Fig . 1 ) has been shown both theoretically and experimentally to perform tasks like sign – sensitive filtering , response acceleration and 2008 IEEE / WIC / ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology 978 - 0 - 7695 - 3496 - 1 / 08 $ 25 . 00 © 2008 IEEE DOI 10 . 1109 / WIIAT . 2008 . 245 9 2008 IEEE / WIC / ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology 978 - 0 - 7695 - 3496 - 1 / 08 $ 25 . 00 © 2008 IEEE DOI 10 . 1109 / WIIAT . 2008 . 245 9 pulse – generation [ 7 ] . Such results reveal that , in general , we may conclude about function and properties of very large networks from their basic building blocks [ 8 ] . In another work , motif analysis was proved to give us the ability of fast detection of the small – world and clustering properties of the large network [ 2 ] . This result open promising but still unexplored possibilities of reasoning about network’s global properties with sampling of local topological structures . Very little research has been done on motifs in computer science and sociology . SPs for small social networks ( < 100 nodes ) were studied in [ 9 ] . A web network counting 3 . 5x10 5 nodes [ 1 ] was used to show the usability of sampling algorithm [ 5 ] . 3 . Motif Analysis Applied to Large Social Network To discover properties of large social networks using the motif analysis , some important issues should be respected . The key parameter that reflects the significance of motifs is Z – score ( Eq . 1 ) . It is based on comparing the actual concentration of subgraphs ( motifs ) in the considered network with their concentration in a set of random networks . For computational complexity reasons the size of this set should be as small as possible . For example , our former research has revealed that 100 random networks provide sufficient accuracy of calculations in case of WUT social network [ 4 ] . The actual profile of the network is expressed by the set of Z – scores of the motifs . In our experiments , we checked all the directed three – node subgraphs called triads . Their concentration values for all triads form so – called Triad Significance Profile of the network ( TSP ) [ 9 ] . The experiments were carried out on the logs from the Wroclaw University of Technology ( WUT ) mail server , which contained only the emails incoming to the staff members as well as organizational units registered at the university [ 6 ] . All experiments were performed with FANMOD tool [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] dedicated for motif detection in large networks . First , the data cleansing process was executed . The bad email addresses were removed from the analysis and the duplicated ones were unified . Additionally , only emails from and to the WUT domain were left . WUT social network consists of nodes and relations between these nodes . The email addresses are the nodes of this network and the relationship between two nodes exists if and only if there is any email communication between them . This network was used for motifs detection in order to check how the TSP profile changes when different periods of time are considered . There are 13 different motifs that consist of three nodes ( Fig . 1 ) . Their IDs = 1 , 2 , … , 13 are used in the further descriptions interchangeably with the corresponding abbreviations M1 , M2 , … , M13 . Fig . 1 . Directed triads and their IDs . The research [ 4 ] confirmed the typical property of social networks – the small – world phenomenon . Loosely connected motifs with only 2 edges , like M2 , M3 , M4 , M7 , M10 occur less frequently compared to the random networks ( which property corresponds to their negative Z - score ) . Triads with edges between any of the three nodes have typically positive ( and large ) Z - scores . It obviously proves the high clustering level , i . e . high probability that two neighbouring nodes have connected neighbours . The only exception is M1 which is met relatively often . This reflects specific property of email – based social networks : there are relatively many broadcasting nodes who spread messages ( news , announcements , bulletins ) which are never answered . 4 . Temporal characteristics of TSPs The next stage of experiments ( which results are presented in this paper ) was conducted to tract the temporal changes in local network structure by creating a set of TSPs for communication data from each month in the period of February 2006 – September 2007 ( further on referred to as months no . 1 up to 20 ) . The results in the form of 3D chart are presented on Fig . 2 . We may see that general shape of the TSP remains constant through time ( and sticks to the properties defined in section 3 ) , but there are also visible differences between consecutive months . To distinguish the motifs , which are most valuable for detecting changes in TSP of the network , the variance of their Z - scores was computed . The best candidates ( for their maximal variance ) appeared to be M1 and M13 ( other interesting motifs , like M4 and M7 will be discussed below ) . 10 10 Fig . 2 TSP changes in WUT social network during 20 months’ period . On Fig . 3 . the changes in the Z - score of M1 and M13 are presented in detail . It can be noticed that maximum values ( which correspond to strong above - statistical occurrence of subgraphs M1 and M13 ) were detected for March 2006 ( month no . 2 ) and February 2006 ( month no . 13 ) in the case of M1 - August 2006 ( no . 6 ) and 2007 ( no . 19 ) for M13 respectively . This effect is correlated with the general business profile of the activities of the WUT employees . Obviously - August , as a peak of holiday season may be associated with minimal communication activity . Correspondingly , February - March period is where the winter and summer semesters meet ( which results in mass communication especially of the broadcast type – reports , announcements etc . ) . - 300 - 200 - 100 0 100 200 300 400 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 Consecutive Months Z - s c o r e M1 M13 M7 M4 Fig . 3 . The changes in Z - score of chosen motifs . In order to confirm these interpretation , the analysis of the intensity of communication in the network was conducted . The number of directed edges in the communication graph was assumed to be the measure of communication intensity ( we are investigating the topology of the network ) . The number of edges and its changes in time are presented on Fig . 4 . 0 5000 10000 15000 20000 25000 30000 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 Consecutive Months N o . o f E dg e s Edges Uni - Dir Bi - Dir Fig . 4 . The number of edges in the network . Note that the activity of WUT employees dramatically decreases during holiday season , but not all types of communication are affected to the same extent . Holiday months ( July - September ) are characterized by relatively big ( clearly bigger then these of M1 ) Z - scores of M13 . For the M13 – a fully connected triad – it means that bi - directional communication in dense cliques is sustained regardless of ( proportionally equal and exceeding 50 % ) decrease in the number of both unidirectional and bi - directional graph edges . On the other hand , unidirectional communication characterized by the over - statistical presence of M1 ( bigger or equal to M13 Z - scores ) is typical for normal business operation during both university semesters . Moreover , from the results of experiments described in [ 4 ] and concerning the same dataset ( with the difference that a static graph for entire 20 - month long communication period was created ) we know that the Z – score of M13 exceeding that of M1 is typical for subnetworks of strong links ( network edges formed only by the intense email communication ) . It can be noticed that these links do not extinct during low activity periods , prevailing over weak , unidirectional ties . Another conclusion concerns M7 , a motif containing a node bi - directionally communicating with the two neighbours from different cliques ( Fig3 ) . Thus , M7 is responsible for connecting cliques . The changes in the occurrence of M7 ( which was shown to have the minimal representation in both classic and email - based social networks , with decisively the smallest Z – score [ 9 ] [ 4 ] ) , however significant , cannot be associated with the abovementioned temporal changes and the business activity of network participants – the links connecting 11 11 groups of users remain unchanged regardless of the level of activity . 5 . Conclusions and further work All the above described changes in the structure of investigated email - based social network are detectable with fast methods dedicated for motif detection ( like sampling method proposed in [ 5 ] ) . This leads a new way of detecting the properties of the network with low computational overhead and minimal cost . An interesting possibility of future temporal motif analysis will be addressing relationship strengths in detail . Complementarities between results of [ 4 ] invoked in sec . 4 and the temporal TSP changes suggest that further experiments may bring interesting results . The most important conclusions concerning temporal characteristics of an email - based social organizational networks are : – the known changes in the all - year activity of university - type organization are detectable with motif analysis and clearly reflected in the TSP of the network . – communication in cliques is sustained during periods of low overall activity , which effect is detectable and characterized by the Z – scores of M13 prevailing over these of M1 . – there is a proportionally equal drop in the number of uni - and bi - directional edges of the network during periods of low activity . At the same time the TSP significantly changes which brings conclusion that not all links are affected in the same way . We have shown that temporal changes in connection patterns of the social network are correlated with changes in the intensity of communication and are detectable by means of motifs analysis ( which , along with fast network sampling techniques , gives us a possibility to insight into the structure of large social network without significant computational overhead ) .
