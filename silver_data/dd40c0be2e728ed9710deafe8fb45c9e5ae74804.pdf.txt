Practical Meta - Analysis - - Lipsey & Wilson Overview 1 Practical Meta - Analysis David B . Wilson American Evaluation Association Orlando , Florida , October 3 , 1999 2 The Great Debate (cid:127) 1952 : Hans J . Eysenck concluded that there were no favorable effects of psychotherapy , starting a raging debate (cid:127) 20 years of evaluation research and hundreds of studies failed to resolve the debate (cid:127) 1978 : To proved Eysenck wrong , Gene V . Glass statistically aggregate the findings of 375 psychotherapy outcome studies (cid:127) Glass ( and colleague Smith ) concluded that psychotherapy did indeed work (cid:127) Glass called his method “meta - analysis” 3 The Emergence of Meta - Analysis (cid:127) Ideas behind meta - analysis predate Glass’ work by several decades – R . A . Fisher ( 1944 ) (cid:127) “When a number of quite independent tests of significance have been made , it sometimes happens that although few or none can be claimed individually as significant , yet the aggregate gives an impression that the probabilities are on the whole lower than would often have been obtained by chance” ( p . 99 ) . (cid:127) Source of the idea of cumulating probability values – W . G . Cochran ( 1953 ) (cid:127) Discusses a method of averaging means across independent studies (cid:127) Laid - out much of the statistical foundation that modern meta - analysis is built upon ( e . g . , inverse variance weighting and homogeneity testing ) 4 The Logic of Meta - Analysis (cid:127) Traditional methods of review focus on statistical significance testing (cid:127) Significance testing is not well suited to this task – highly dependent on sample size – null finding does not carry to same “weight” as a significant finding (cid:127) Meta - analysis changes the focus to the direction and magnitude of the effects across studies – Isn’t this what we are interested in anyway ? – Direction and magnitude represented by the effect size 1 Practical Meta - Analysis - - Lipsey & Wilson Overview 5 When Can You Do Meta - Analysis ? (cid:127) Meta - analysis is applicable to collections of research that – are empirical , rather than theoretical – produce quantitative results , rather than qualitative findings – examine the same constructs and relationships – have findings that can be configured in a comparable statistical form ( e . g . , as effect sizes , correlation coefficients , odds - ratios , etc . ) – are “comparable” given the question at hand 6 Forms of Research Findings Suitable to Meta - Analysis (cid:127) Central Tendency Research – prevalence rates (cid:127) Pre - Post Contrasts – growth rates (cid:127) Group Contrasts – experimentally created groups (cid:127) comparison of outcomes between treatment and comparison groups – naturally occurring groups (cid:127) comparison of spatial abilities between boys and girls (cid:127) Association Between Variables – measurement research (cid:127) validity generalization – individual differences research (cid:127) correlation between personality constructs 7 Effect Size : The Key to Meta - Analysis (cid:127) The effect size makes meta - analysis possible – it is the “dependent variable” – it standardizes findings across studies such that they can be directly compared (cid:127) Any standardized index can be an “effect size” ( e . g . , standardized mean difference , correlation coefficient , odds - ratio ) as long as it meets the following – is comparable across studies ( generally requires standardization ) – represents the magnitude and direction of the relationship of interest – is independent of sample size (cid:127) Different meta - analyses may use different effect size indices 8 The Replication Continuum PureReplications ConceptualReplications You must be able to argue that the collection of studies you are meta - analyzing examine the same relationship . This may be at a broad level of abstraction , such as the relationship between criminal justice interventions and recidivism or between school - based prevention programs and problem behavior . Alternatively it may be at a narrow level of abstraction and represent pure replications . The closer to pure replications your collection of studies , the easier it is to argue comparability . 2 Practical Meta - Analysis - - Lipsey & Wilson Overview 9 Which Studies to Include ? (cid:127) It is critical to have an explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria ( see handout ) – the broader the research domain , the more detailed they tend to become – developed iteratively as you interact with the literature (cid:127) To include or exclude low quality studies – the findings of all studies are potentially in error ( methodological quality is a continuum , not a dichotomy ) – being too restrictive may restrict ability to generalize – being too inclusive may weaken the confidence that can be placed in the findings – must strike a balance that is appropriate to your research question 10 Searching Far and Wide (cid:127) The “we only included published studies because they have been peer - reviewed” argument (cid:127) Significant findings are more likely to be published than nonsignificant findings (cid:127) Critical to try to identify and retrieve all studies that meet your eligibility criteria (cid:127) Potential sources for identification of documents – computerized bibliographic databases – authors working in the research domain – conference programs – dissertations – review articles – hand searching relevant journal – government reports , bibliographies , clearinghouses 11 Strengths of Meta - Analysis (cid:127) Imposes a discipline on the process of summing up research findings (cid:127) Represents findings in a more differentiated and sophisticated manner than conventional reviews (cid:127) Capable of finding relationships across studies that are obscured in other approaches (cid:127) Protects against over - interpreting differences across studies (cid:127) Can handle a large numbers of studies ( this would overwhelm traditional approaches to review ) 12 Weaknesses of Meta - Analysis (cid:127) Requires a good deal of effort (cid:127) Mechanical aspects don’t lend themselves to capturing more qualitative distinctions between studies (cid:127) “Apples and oranges” ; comparability of studies is often in the “eye of the beholder” (cid:127) Most meta - analyses include “blemished” studies (cid:127) Selection bias posses continual threat – negative and null finding studies that you were unable to find – outcomes for which there were negative or null findings that were not reported (cid:127) Analysis of between study differences is fundamentally correlational 3 Practical Meta - Analysis - - Lipsey & Wilson Effect Size Overheads 1 The Effect Size (cid:127) The effect size ( ES ) makes meta - analysis possible . (cid:127) The ES encodes the selected research findings on a numeric scale . (cid:127) There are many different types of ES measures , each suited to different research situations . (cid:127) Each ES type may also have multiple methods of computation . 2 Examples of Different Types of Effect Sizes : The Major Leagues (cid:127) Standardized Mean Difference – group contrast research (cid:127) treatment groups (cid:127) naturally occurring groups – inherently continuous construct (cid:127) Odds - Ratio – group contrast research (cid:127) treatment groups (cid:127) naturally occurring groups – inherently dichotomous construct (cid:127) Correlation Coefficient – association between variables research 3 Examples of Different Types of Effect Sizes : Two from the Minor Leagues (cid:127) Proportion – central tendency research (cid:127) HIV / AIDS prevalence rates (cid:127) Proportion of homeless persons found to be alcohol abusers (cid:127) Standardized Gain Score – gain or change between two measurement points on the same variable (cid:127) reading speed before and after a reading improvement class 4 What Makes Something an Effect Size for Meta - Analytic Purposes (cid:127) The type of ES must be comparable across the collection of studies of interest . (cid:127) This is generally accomplished through standardization . (cid:127) Must be able to calculate a standard error for that type of ES – the standard error is needed to calculate the ES weights , called inverse variance weights ( more on this latter ) – all meta - analytic analyses are weighted 4 Practical Meta - Analysis - - Lipsey & Wilson Effect Size Overheads 5 The Standardized Mean Difference (cid:127) Represents a standardized group contrast on an inherently continuous measure . (cid:127) Uses the pooled standard deviation ( some situations use control group standard deviation ) . (cid:127) Commonly called “d” or occasionally “g” . pooled G G s X X ES 2 1 (cid:16) (cid:32) (cid:11) (cid:12) (cid:11) (cid:12) 2 1 1 2 1 2 22 1 21 (cid:16) (cid:14) (cid:16) (cid:14) (cid:16) (cid:32) n n n s n s s pooled 6 The Correlation Coefficient (cid:127) Represents the strength of association between two inherently continuous measures . (cid:127) Generally reported directly as “r” ( the Pearson product moment coefficient ) . r ES (cid:32) 7 The Odds - Ratio (cid:127) The Odds - Ratio is based on a 2 by 2 contingency table , such as the one below . Frequencies Success Failure Treatment Group a b Control Group c d bc ad ES (cid:32) (cid:127) The Odds - Ratio is the odds of success in the treatment group relative to the odds of success in the control group . 8 Methods of Calculating the Standardized Mean Difference (cid:127) The standardized mean difference probably has more methods of calculation than any other effect size type . 5 Practical Meta - Analysis - - Lipsey & Wilson Effect Size Overheads 9 The different formulas represent degrees of approximation to the ES value that would be obtained based on the means and standard deviations – direct calculation based on means and standard deviations – algebraically equivalent formulas ( t - test ) – exact probability value for a t - test – approximations based on continuous data ( correlation coefficient ) – estimates of the mean difference ( adjusted means , regression B weight , gain score means ) – estimates of the pooled standard deviation ( gain score standard deviation , one - way ANOVA with 3 or more groups , ANCOVA ) – approximations based on dichotomous data G r ea t G ood P oo r 10 Methods of Calculating the Standardized Mean Difference pooled s X X n n n s n s X X ES 2 1 2 1 2 22 1 21 2 1 2 ) 1 ( ) 1 ( (cid:16) (cid:32) (cid:16) (cid:14) (cid:16) (cid:14) (cid:16) (cid:16) (cid:32) Direction Calculation Method 11 Methods of Calculating the Standardized Mean Difference 2 1 2 1 n n n n t ES (cid:14) (cid:32) Algebraically Equivalent Formulas : 2 1 2 1 ) ( n n n n F ES (cid:14) (cid:32) independent t - test two - group one - way ANOVA exact p - values from a t - test or F - ratio can be converted into t - value and the above formula applied 12 Methods of Calculating the Standardized Mean Difference A study may report a grouped frequency distribution from which you can calculate means and standard deviations and apply to direct calculation method . 6 Practical Meta - Analysis - - Lipsey & Wilson Effect Size Overheads 13 Methods of Calculating the Standardized Mean Difference 2 1 2 r r ES (cid:16) (cid:32) Close Approximation Based on Continuous Data - - Point - Biserial Correlation .

(cid:127) An ES based on 100 subjects is assumed to be a more “precise” estimate of the population ES than is an ES based on 10 subjects . (cid:127) Therefore , larger studies should carry more “weight” in our analyses than smaller studies . (cid:127) Simple approach : weight each ES by its sample size . (cid:127) Better approach : weight by the inverse variance . 11 What is the Inverse Variance Weight ? (cid:127) The standard error ( SE ) is a direct index of ES precision . (cid:127) SE is used to create confidence intervals . (cid:127) The smaller the SE , the more precise the ES . (cid:127) Hedges’ showed that the optimal weights for meta - analysis are : 2 1 SE w (cid:32) 12 Inverse Variance Weight for the Three Major League Effect Sizes (cid:127) Standardized Mean Difference : 2 1 se w (cid:32) ) ( 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 n n ES n n n n se sm (cid:14) (cid:14) (cid:14) (cid:32) (cid:127) Zr transformed Correlation Coefficient : 3 (cid:16) (cid:32) n w 3 1 (cid:16) (cid:32) n se 13 Practical Meta - Analysis - - Lipsey & Wilson Analysis Overheads 13 Inverse Variance Weight for the Three Major League Effect Sizes (cid:127) Logged Odds - Ratio : 2 1 se w (cid:32) d c b a se 1 1 1 1 (cid:14) (cid:14) (cid:14) (cid:32) Where a , b , c , and d are the cell frequencies of a 2 by 2 contingency table . 14 Ready to Analyze (cid:127) We have an independent set of effect sizes ( ES ) that have been transformed and / or adjusted , if needed .

If residual Q is significant , fit a mixed effects model . 18 Practical Meta - Analysis - - Lipsey & Wilson Analysis Overheads 33 Review of Weighted Multiple Regression Analysis (cid:127) Analysis is weighted . (cid:127) Q for the model indicates if the regression model explains a significant portion of the variability across effect sizes . (cid:127) Q for the residual indicates if the remaining variability across effect sizes is homogeneous . (cid:127) If using a “canned” regression program , must correct the probability values ( see manuscript for details ) . 34 Random Effects Models (cid:127) Don’t panic ! (cid:127) It sounds far worse than it is . (cid:127) Three reasons to use a random effects model – Total Q is significant and you assume that the excess variability across effect sizes derives from random differences across studies ( sources you cannot identify or measure ) . – The Q within from an Analog to the ANOVA is significant . – The Q residual from a Weighted Multiple Regression analysis is significant . 35 The Logic of a Random Effects Model (cid:127) Fixed effects model assumes that all of the variability between effect sizes is due to sampling error . (cid:127) Random effects model assumes that the variability between effect sizes is due to sampling error plus variability in the population of effects ( unique differences in the set of true population effect sizes ) . 36 The Basic Procedure of a Random Effects Model (cid:127) Fixed effects model weights each study by the inverse of the sampling variance . (cid:127) Random effects model weights each study by the inverse of the sampling variance plus a constant that represents the variability across the population effects . 2 1 i i se w (cid:32) (cid:84) v se w i i ˆ 1 2 (cid:14) (cid:32) This is the random effects variance component . 19 Practical Meta - Analysis - - Lipsey & Wilson Analysis Overheads 37 How To Estimate the Random Effects Variance Component (cid:127) The random effects variance component is based on Q .

(cid:127) Studies often cannot simply be grouped into “good” and “bad” studies . (cid:127) Some methodological weaknesses may bias the overall findings , others may merely add “noise” to the distribution . 22 Practical Meta - Analysis - - Lipsey & Wilson Interpretation Overheads 5 Confounding of Study Features (cid:127) Relative comparisons of effect sizes across studies are inherently correlational ! (cid:127) Important study features are often confounding , obscuring the interpretive meaning of observed differences (cid:127) If the confounding is not severe and you have a sufficient number of studies , you can model “out” the influence of method features to clarify substantive differences 6 Concluding Comments (cid:127) Meta - analysis is a replicable and defensible method of synthesizing findings across studies (cid:127) Meta - analysis often points out gaps in the research literature , providing a solid foundation for the next generation of research on that topic (cid:127) Meta - analysis illustrates the importance of replication (cid:127) Meta - analysis facilitates generalization of the knowledge gain through individual evaluations 23
