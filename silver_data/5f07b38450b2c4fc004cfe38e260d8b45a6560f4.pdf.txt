Within a multicellular tissue , the precise control of these physical characteristics in space and time is critical for the maintenance of mechanical integrity and biological function . Deviation from mechanical haemostasis is associated with diseases , including aberrant wound repair , developmental abnormalities and cancer 11 – 17 . In isolated cells in vitro , for example , increased deform - ability 18 – 21 , intracellular dynamics 22 , contractility 23 and mobility have each been identified as a physical hallmark of different types of can - cer 24 and have been proposed as potential targets for cancer treat - ment 25 . Despite the promise of in vitro approaches , extensive studies have shown that the mechanical properties of cells are regulated by their microenvironment , including but not limited to stiffness of the surrounding matrix , cell densities and dimensions 26 , 27 . Hence , in the context of a multicellular system in the three - dimensional ( 3D ) microenvironment , it remains unknown how the physical charac - teristics of individual cells regulate and coordinate tumour develop - ment and invasion . By integrating confocal microscopy with optical tweezers , we have developed a platform to measure morphological char - acteristics , physical properties and migratory dynamics of indi - vidual cells throughout a growing multicellular 3D breast cancer model 11 , 12 . By tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of individual cells during the growing process , we find heterogeneous patterns of cellular physical characteristics that facilitate tumour cell inva - sion . Compared with cells in the organoid core , those at the inva - sive leading edge are faster , softer and larger . The volumes of both the cell body and the nucleus are larger at the invasive leading edge , and the temporal fluctuations characterizing cytoplasmic dynamics become stronger . Blocking gap junctions ( GJs ) sig - nificantly suppresses these changes , suggesting that supracellular fluid flow may drive the evolution of the observed patterns of cel - lular properties . Furthermore , the elimination of the softer sub - population in the cancer organoid strongly delays the transition to an invasive phenotype . These findings highlight a causal role of spatiotemporal coordination of cellular physical properties— especially cell swelling and softening—in tumour development and invasive dynamics . Epithelial cancer organoids have been widely used to model glandular epithelial cancers in 3D culture systems 28 ; these models recapitulate distinguishing physiological features of epithelial tis - sues and capture the pathological features of epithelial tumours . For example , the well - ordered epithelial architecture becomes dis - rupted , the lumen fills with cells and invasive branches then form 28 . To reveal the mechanical underpinnings of this process , we trans - fected MCF 10A human breast epithelial cells with a green fluores - cent protein ( GFP ) tagged with a nuclear - localization signal ( NLS ) . We then seeded these cells into a 3D interpenetrating network hydrogel composed of 5 mg ml − 1 alginate and 4 mg ml − 1 Matrigel 12 , with a shear modulus close to 300 Pa to mimic the mechanical microenvironment of a breast carcinoma in vivo 12 , 29 . Starting from a single cell , a multicellular cluster grows , and invasive branches develop over approximately 10 days ( Fig . 1a – c ) ; in accordance with recent definitions , we call this cluster a cancer organoid 30 . During the early stage , an individual MCF 10A cell pro - liferates to form a spherical cluster ( early stage ; Fig . 1a , day 3 ) . This cell cluster grows into a larger spheroid with cells both in the core and on the periphery ( middle stage ; Fig . 1b , day 5 ) . As this spher - oid develops further , invasive branches extend from the main body and invade the surrounding extracellular matrix ( ECM ) ( later stage ; Fig . 1c , day 10 ) . The phenotype observed in this 3D breast can - cer model shows uncontrolled cellular proliferation , lack of cel - lular polarization and the initiation of matrix invasion , much like those observed in vivo in invasive ductal carcinomas ( Fig . 1d ) .

Fredberg 7 and Ming Guo 1 * Control of the structure and function of three - dimensional multicellular tissues depends critically on the spatial and temporal coordination of cellular physical properties , yet the organizational principles that govern these events and their disruption in disease remain poorly understood . Using a multicellular mammary cancer organoid model , we map here the spatial and tempo - ral evolution of positions , motions and physical characteristics of individual cells in three dimensions . Compared with cells in the organoid core , cells at the organoid periphery and the invasive front are found to be systematically softer , larger and more dynamic . These mechanical changes are shown to arise from supracellular fluid flow through gap junctions , the suppression of which delays the transition to an invasive phenotype . These findings highlight the role of spatiotemporal coordination of cel - lular physical properties in tissue organization and disease progression .

The molecular pathways that regulate the invasion process in this model system have been well studied 11 , 12 , but the associated changes in the physical properties of cells remain largely unknown . To char - acterize cell mechanics in this growing epithelial cancer organoid , we used optical tweezers to perform active microrheology and thus measure the mechanical properties of the cytoplasm within indi - vidual cells . To do this , we mixed small particles ( 0 . 5 μ m diameter ) into the ECM that became endocytosed by individual constitu - ent cells . These particles were dragged unidirectionally by optical tweezers at 0 . 5 μ m s − 1 to obtain a force – displacement relationship in the cytoplasm ( illustrated in Fig . 1e ) , which thus characterized the cytoplasmic stiffness within each cell 31 . This force – displacement relationship was found to vary spatially within the growing cancer organoid ( Fig . 1f , inset ) . To compare different regions , we spatially segmented the cancer organoid into three different populations : core , periphery and branch . At early stages , only one population was evident . At middle stages , however , cells were classified as being in the core if they were within the inner 40 % of the cancer organ - oid radius . After branches formed , a central spheroidal mass was defined and separated into core and periphery cells , with all other cells assigned to the branches ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ) . We found that the force required to deform the cytoplasm of cells in the core of the cancer organoid was appreciably greater than that required for cells in the periphery or in a branch ( Fig . 1f , inset ) . To further quantify this difference , we measured an apparent modulus E A of the cytoplasm by taking the average slope of the linear regime of the normalized force – displacement curve . We found that the cells in the core of the cancer organoid were the stiffest , while the cells in the branches were the softest ( Fig . 1f ) . Moreover , the range of stiffness and the population heterogeneity increased as the cancer organoid developed ( Fig . 1g ) , consistent with findings from in vivo samples , where increasing mechanical heterogeneity during disease progression has been observed 32 . This evolution from a homoge - neous to heterogeneous population with distinct mechanical prop - erties is reminiscent of the epigenetic heterogeneity that has been observed in breast tumour progression 33 . Given the spatial variation observed in cell stiffness , we won - dered whether cytoplasmic dynamics also vary in different regions of the cancer organoid . To quantify cytoplasmic dynamics , we used confocal microscopy to image spontaneous fluctuations of endo - cytosed fluorescent particles ( 0 . 5 μ m diameter ) , which are larger than the typical cytoskeletal mesh size ( ∼ 50 nm ) ; particle motions reflect the active non - equilibrium force fluctuations that spon - taneously arise within the cytoplasm and thus also influence the dynamics of proteins and organelles in the cytoplasm 22 . By tracking trajectories of these particles , we calculated the time - and ensem - ble - averaged mean - squared displacement ( MSD ) < Δ r 2 ( τ ) > , where Δ r ( τ ) = r ( t + τ ) − r ( t ) , r and τ represent the particle displacement and the lag time . When comparing the MSD for different regions of the cancer organoid , we found that the dynamics in the core were smallest , followed by those in the periphery cells , with branch cells showing the greatest cytoplasmic dynamics ( Fig . 2a ) .

While the change in intracellular dynamics was consistent with the changes in cytoplasmic stiffness , the dynamics are influenced not only by the passive mechanical properties of the cytoplasm but also by active ATP - dependent force fluctuations within the cell 22 . To measure the latter , we used force spectrum microscopy ( FSM ) , which combines measurements of the spontaneous fluctuations of probe particles with the micromechanical measurement in the cyto - plasm to quantify the spectrum of the aggregate force fluctuations < f 2 ( ω ) > in the cell , where f is the aggregate force in the cytoplasm and ω is the frequency ; this force fluctuation spectrum reflects the total enzymatic activity 22 . Using FSM , we found that cells in the branch have the highest cytoplasmic force fluctuations , with magni - tudes approximately five times greater at 1 Hz than those of cells in the spheroid core ( Fig . 2b ) . We also assessed cell motility by imaging the cancer organoid at a high spatial and temporal resolution . Full 3D images of the organoid were recorded by confocal microscopy every 10 min over a period of 24 h subsequent to a branch forming ( Supplementary Videos 1 and 2 ) . By tracking the position of every cell nucleus , cell tracks were constructed ( Fig . 2c ) . From the cell tracks , the migration speed of every cell in this 3D organoid was calculated . All cells were constantly migrating , but cells in the branches or in the periphery migrated faster than cells in the core ( Fig . 2d ) . This spatial depen - dence in migration speed mirrored the spatial dependence of cyto - plasmic dynamics . Cell volume is another important physiological property that is known to correlate with cell stiffness and dynamics 26 , 34 . To compare cell and nuclear volumes , we fluorescently labelled the whole cell using cytoplasmic staining ( in addition to the already GFP - NLS - labelled cell nuclei ) and measured volumes using 3D confocal microscopy . We found that over a wide range of organoid sizes , the ratio of nuclear to cell volume in individual cells remained constant ( 13 ± 1 % , Supplementary Fig . 3 ) , in agreement with previous find - ings 26 , 35 , allowing us to measure nuclear volume in lieu of cell vol - ume . At early stages of cancer organoid development , when no clear subregions existed , cells had similar nuclear volumes ( Fig . 3a , day 3 ) . As the organoid developed , nuclear volumes increased in spatial variability ( Fig . 3a , days 5 and 10 ) ; the nuclear volume of the cells correlated strongly with the relative cell positions within the cancer organoid ( Fig . 3b , days 5 and 10 ) , with smaller cells in the core . The transition from the early to middle period of development led to cells in the core becoming systematically smaller ( Fig . 3c , day 5 ) .

While the core and periphery still displayed clearly distinct nuclear volumes , the formation of invasive branches resulted in cells with even larger nuclear volumes ( Fig . 3c , day 10 ) . The nuclear volume of cells in the same regime also evolved as the cancer organoid grew ; cell nuclei in the core became smaller as the size of the cancer organoid increased from days 5 to 10 ( Fig . 3c , blue boxes ) . This spatial pattern of nuclear volume was also observed in other 3D mammary cancer models using different cell lines and ECMs , such as MCF 10A and MCF 10AT in the collagen – Matrigel system 11 ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . GJs are specialized intercellular connections between epithe - lial cells and have been widely observed in normal and malignant breast tissues 36 . They connect the cytoplasm of two neighbouring cells , and thus allow molecules and ions to directly pass through 37 , 38 . Accumulating evidence has shown that there is compressive stress within tumour tissue and 3D cancer models 39 – 42 . Therefore , we hypothesize that the observed volume gradient in our system is a result of supracellular fluid flow through cell – cell GJs , driven by the higher intratumour compressive stress . To test whether the volume gradient is GJ - dependent , we added a GJ inhibitor ( car - benoxolone 43 , 500 µ M ) to our system on day 3 , when the volume gradient was not yet present ( Fig . 3a , b , day 3 ) . As the cancer organ - oid continued to grow , we did not observe a significant difference in the nuclear volume of cells between those in the core and the periphery ( Fig . 3d ) . Similar results were observed when we used a different type of GJ inhibitor , connexin mimetic peptides ( CMPs ) 44 ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) .

NATure PHYSiCS | VOL 16 | JANUArY 2020 | 101 – 108 | www . nature . com / naturephysics 104 Articles NaTUre PhysiCs the organoid play a role in the development of the observed cellular volume pattern . It has also been consistently shown that externally applied mechanical stress can drive fluid flow between cells through GJs in a two - dimensional ( 2D ) monolayer 45 and in 3D MCF 10A clusters 46 to induce cell volume variations . To investigate this hypothesis further , we tested whether the intratumour mechanical stress 39 – 42 is a factor in the observed cell volume gradient . Using organoids cultured in a collagen – Matrigel network , we reduced the mechanical stresses on day 5 by releas - ing the organoids from the matrix confinement using collagenase . Six hours after stress release , we observed a significant increase in the cellular volume in the core and a decrease in cellular volume in the periphery ( Fig . 3e , stress release ) . The initial cell volume gradi - ent then became much weaker , suggesting an inverse supracellular fluid flow from the periphery to the core following stress release . To further test our hypothesis that GJs play a role in supracellular fluid flow , we blocked the GJs 6 h before releasing the stress , and we did not observe any significant changes in cellular volume or cell volume gradient on stress release ( Fig . 3e , ‘GJ inhibitor + stress release’ ) . These results indicate that the imbalance of intratumour stress drives a fluid flow through GJs in the 3D cancer model sys - tem , which results in the swelling and shrinking of cells in the periphery and the core , respectively . For both isolated cells and confluent monolayers in 2D , cell vol - ume has been found to vary with cell stiffness and internal dynam - ics , with a decrease in cell volume corresponding to an increase in cell stiffness and a decrease in internal dynamics 26 , 34 . Similar trends prevailed in the developing 3D cancer organoid . Cells in the core became smaller , stiffer and less dynamic . By contrast , cells in the branches became bigger , softer and more dynamic . When we tracked individual cell positions over time , we found that cells transit from the core to the periphery or vice versa ( Supplementary Fig . 6a , b ) . Moreover , if we track a cell in a branch it tends to be swollen , but as it moves towards the core , it shrinks . The converse is true for tracking a cell in the core ( Supplementary Fig . 6c , d ) ; as a cell transits the cancer organoid , it adjusts its physical properties to its local microenvironment . The responsiveness of cell volume to the local microenviron - ment raises the question of whether similar variability in cell vol - ume exists in real tumour samples . To answer this question , we obtained grade - 2 ER + invasive ductal carcinoma human breast cancer tissue samples from a patient , then fixed and sectioned each sample before staining and imaging them with confocal microscopy ( Fig . 4a , b ) . Within the tumour mass , spheroidal , acinar clusters of cells surrounded by basement membrane were evident ( Fig . 4c and Supplementary Video 3 ) , which share simi - lar characteristics with our 3D cancer model . In such spheroidal acinar clusters , we found that the nuclear volume increased as the distance from the centre increased ( Fig . 4d ) , consistent with our model system . Cells in the core had smaller volumes , while inva - sive cells that appeared to have escaped from the main cluster had larger volumes ( Fig . 4e ) . These findings raise the interesting question of whether the swelling and softening of peripheral cells are important factors in invasive dynamics . To investigate this further , we artificially manipulated the stiffness and volume of peripheral cells . For exam - ple , we changed the osmotic pressure to either compress ( with an additional 2 % PEG300 ) or swell ( with an additional 10 % water ) the cells on day 3 , before the formation of various subpopulations ( Fig . 5a – c ) . We also tried increasing cell stiffness using the chemo - therapy medication daunorubicin ( 0 . 5 μ M ) , jasplakinolide ( 5 μ M ) 47 or overexpression of actin crosslinking protein α - actinin . We found that the volume of cells in the periphery changed , while little change was observed in the core ( Fig . 5f ) . The decrease or increase in cell volume was accompanied by a corresponding increase or decrease in cell stiffness ( Fig . 5f ) . Long - term exposure to any of these inter - ventions did not significantly impair cell proliferation ; the projected area of individual growing cancer organoids increased over time in a fashion similar to those in the control medium ( Fig . 5d ) . However , the invasion changed considerably compared with the control case , where invasiveness was quantified as the percentage of can - cer organoids that formed invasive branches after 11 days in each sample , with softer peripheral cells leading to greater invasiveness ( Fig . 5e , Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . Furthermore , we used GJ inhibi - tors ( carbenoxolone 43 , 500 µ M , or CMPs 44 , 600 µ M ) to perturb the spontaneous cell swelling and softening process in our system on day 3 ( Fig . 5f ) and found that the invasion of the tumour cells was also delayed ( Fig . 5e ) . To exclude the possibility that GJ inhibitors directly impact cell mechanics , we measured the cytoplasmic stiff - ness of isolated MCF 10A cells with GJ inhibitors on a 2D surface and found that the GJ inhibitors did not affect cytoplasmic stiffness ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) .

An understanding of how mechanical changes in cells enable dis - ease advancement is critical for determining how cancer progresses . The invasion of MCF 10A clusters has previously been shown to depend on ECM mechanics through PI3K activation 11 , 12 , 48 ; we indeed confirm that this is critical for disease initiation ( Supplementary Figs . 9 and 10 ) . However , after this initial stage of disease progres - sion , we found that mechanical heterogeneity increased , giving rise to larger , softer cells and enhanced invasiveness . For isolated cells in the 3D culture , cell – matrix interactions can potentially lead to an increase in cell volume 49 ; this cannot be excluded from the fac - tors that play a role in peripheral cells . Nonetheless , the inhibition of GJs interfered with cell volume change during growth and stress release , indicating that fluid flow across cell boundaries plays a role in mechanical pattern formation . The role of GJs in cancer progres - sion is still under debate , with both promotion and suppression of invasiveness having been observed across various types of cancer and GJ 50 . Our results hint at a purely physical mechanism by which GJs can affect cancer progression . A change in the water content of cells and hence the degree of molecular crowding 26 , 34 will affect a wide range of downstream cell functions and properties . As such , our emerging physical picture of tumour progression now includes 3D spatiotemporal evolution of cellular physical properties .

The mammary epithelial cancer organoid with invasive phenotype was cultured and induced following a previously established protocol 11 , 12 . Briefly , MCF 10A cells ( ATCC ) were cultured in a DMEM / F12 medium ( Invitrogen , 11965 - 118 ) supplemented with 5 % horse serum ( Invitrogen , 16050 - 122 ) , 20 ng ml − 1 epidermal growth factor ( Peprotech , AF - 100 - 15 ) , 0 . 5 μ g ml − 1 hydrocortisone ( Sigma , H - 0888 ) , 100 ng ml − 1 cholera toxin ( Sigma , C - 8052 ) , 10 μ g ml − 1 insulin ( Sigma , I - 1882 ) and 1 % penicillin and streptomycin ( Thermo Fisher , 15140122 ) . The cells were collected using a 0 . 05 % trypsin - EDTA solution ( Thermo Fisher , 25300054 ) after they reached confluence within T - 25 flasks in a normal cell culture incubator and were mixed with the gel precursor solution at a low cell concentration ( 10 4 ml − 1 ) to avoid interaction between cancer organoids . For alginate – Matrigel interpenetrating network hydrogels , the gel was composed of alginate ( FMC Biopolymer ) and Matrigel ( Corning , 354234 ) with final concentrations of 5 mg ml − 1 and 4 mg ml − 1 , respectively . The gel precursor with cells was put in the cell culture incubator for gelation . After 1 h , an additional complete culture medium was added to keep the gel hydrated . Cancer organoids developed in the 3D gels in the following ∼ 10 days . For the collagen – Matrigel system , the gel was composed of 3 . 5 mg ml − 1 collagen and 0 . 5 mg ml − 1 Matrigel . The MCF 10AT cell line was a gift from J . Nickerson at the University of Massachusetts Medical School and was cultured under the same conditions as the MCF 10A cell line . For immunohistochemical staining , the cancer organoids were cultured from normal MCF 10A cells ( without GFP - NLS ) . The 3D gel with embedded cancer organoids was fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min . To increase the permeability of the cell membrane , the gel was immersed in PBS supplied with 0 . 2 % Triton - X100 ( 2 h , room temperature ) . The sample was then blocked with 0 . 5 % BSA in PBS for 5 h at room temperature and subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies for Cytokeratin 8 ( 1 : 300 diluted in PBS ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , sc - 8020 ) , Cytokeratin 14 ( 1 : 300 diluted in PBS ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , sc - 53253 ) , Phospho - Akt ( 1 : 200 diluted in PBS ; Cell Signaling , 9271T ) , β - catenin ( 1 : 300 diluted in PBS ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , sc - 7963 ) , Integrin β 4 ( 1 : 300 diluted in PBS ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , sc - 13543 ) or laminin - 5 ( 1 : 300 diluted in PBS ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , sc - 13587 ) . Corresponding secondary antibodies were added and incubated for another night at 4 °C ( 1 : 800 ; Thermo Fisher , A - 11001 or A - 11008 ) . Finally , 4 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( Thermo Fisher , D1306 ) was added for another 4 h to stain the cell nuclei . After each step , the samples were washed with PBS for at least 6 h . Optical tweezer measurement . The laser beam ( 10 W , 1 , 064 nm ) was tightly focused through a series of Keplerian beam expanders and a high numerical aperture objective ( × 100 , 1 . 45 , oil , Nikon ) . A high - resolution quadrant detector was used for position detection . To measure the mechanical properties of the cytoplasm , 0 . 5 - μ m - diameter latex particles ( Sigma , L3280 ) were embedded in the gel and were endocytosed by the cells as they grew into cancer organoids . The linear regions of the detector and the trap stiffness were calibrated with the same bead using an active power - spectrum method and the equipartition theorem 31 , 51 , 52 . The endocytosed bead was dragged at a constant velocity of 0 . 5 μ m s − 1 by the optical trap , and the force – displacement curve of the local cytoplasm was recorded . To calculate E A , the force and displacement were normalized by the cross - section area and the diameter of the particle , respectively . The slope in the linear range of the normalized force – displacement curve was taken as the E A . FSM . FSM combines measurements of the spontaneous fluctuation of probe particles with the micromechanical measurement in the cytoplasm to quantify the spectrum of < f 2 ( ω ) > in the cell , which in turn reflects total enzymatic activity 22 . To measure the spontaneous fluctuation of the cytoplasm , 0 . 5 - μ m - diameter fluorescent particles ( Sigma , L5530 ) were embedded in the gel and were endocytosed by the cells as they grew into cancer organoids . The motions of the particles within the cytoplasm were recorded with a 10 ms interval using confocal microscopy . Particle centres were determined in each frame , and the trajectories of particles were obtained by minimizing the overall displacement between consecutive frames as demonstrated previously 22 , 53 using a customized particle tracking algorithm . Time - and ensemble - averaged values of MSD were then calculated . The force spectrum was calculated using < f 2 ( ω ) > = | K ( ω ) | 2 < r 2 ( ω ) > , where < r 2 ( ω ) > was obtained through the Fourier transform of MSD and the cytoplasmic spring constant K ( ω ) was obtained from the optical tweezer measurement with a power law assumption K ( ω ) = K ( ω = 1 Hz ) ω β , with β = 0 . 15 ( refs . 22 , 54 ) . Cell dynamics within the growing cancer organoid . To track the movement of individual cells , cancer organoids of GFP - NLS - labelled cells at different stages ( days 3 , 5 and 10 ) were imaged every 10 min for 24 h in a customized incubator ( 5 % CO 2 , 37 °C , 95 % humidity ) on a confocal microscope ( Leica , TCL SP8 ) . The 3D positions of cell nuclei were determined at each frame , and the trajectory of each cell was determined using the same particle - tracking method and algorithm as described above . The velocity of the cells can be calculated from the adjacent positions on the trajectory of each cell . Cell and nuclear volume measurements . To visualize the cell nucleus , the MCF 10A cell line was transfected with GFP - NLS using lentivirus ( Essen Bioscience , 4475 ) . Stable cell lines were selected in a puromycin - containing culture medium ( 0 . 4 mg ml − 1 ; Thermo Fisher , A1113802 ) . To study the volume evolution during the growth of the cancer organoid , cancer organoids were formed in the hydrogel and cultured in a customized incubator ( 5 % CO 2 , 37 °C , 95 % humidity ) on a confocal microscope . The 3D conformation of the cancer organoid was recorded every 6 h for 2 weeks . The 3D structure of each cell nucleus within a cancer organoid was reconstructed , and the nuclear volume was calculated by counting the voxels contained within the 3D structure using a customized algorithm in MATLAB ( 2017a ) . Deconvolution ( HUYGENS software ) was applied to the image before we calculated the volume , which helps improve the z resolution of traditional confocal microscopy . To estimate the error in the volume calculation from anisotropic resolution of the confocal microscope , we repeated our volume measurements using stimulated emission depletion microscopy with a super - resolution mode in the z direction ( ∼ 250 nm ) , which is similar to the resolution in the x – y plane , to provide an isotropic volume reconstruction . We found a consistent volume pattern , as shown in Supplementary Fig . 11a . We also imaged the same cancer spheroid with both confocal microscopy and the super - resolution mode in stimulated emission depletion microscopy ; we compared the cell volume measurement of each cell with these two methods and found consistent results ( Supplementary Fig . 11b ) . To calculate the distance from a cell to the centre of the cancer organoid , the centre of each cell was determined by locating the local intensity maximum within the nucleus , and the centre of the cancer organoid was calculated as the geometric centre of the shape formed by all of the cells . Cells were classified as being in the core if they were within the inner 40 % of the cancer organoid radius at middle stage . After branches formed , a central spheroidal mass was defined and separated into core and periphery cells , with all other cells assigned to the branches . Using this geometrical categorization , the cell nuclear volume distribution is consistent with the results using molecular signatures as metric 55 , as shown in Supplementary Fig . 12 . To obtain the nuclear volume heat map , we projected each cell from a 20 - µ m - thick section at the middle plane of the cancer organoid into the x – y plane , and the nuclear volume at each location ( 6 . 5 μ m × 6 . 5 μ m grids on the x – y plane ) was obtained by averaging the nuclear volumes of all cells going through this particular location during a 2 h window . To measure the cell volume , the GFP - NLS - expressing MCF 10A cells were incubated with cell - tracker deep - red dye ( Thermo Fisher , C34565 ) and were mixed with non - fluorescent cells ( those without cell - tracker red ) to make the individual fluorescent cells distinguishable from their neighbours within the formed cancer organoid ; these cancer organoids for cell volume measurement were formed using a poly ( ethylene glycol ) - based microwell . The 3D morphology of both the nucleus and cell body were then imaged with confocal microscopy , and volumes were calculated with the same algorithm in MATLAB . Human tissue . Human tissue samples , including the normal breast tissue and tumour tissue , were obtained at the Xuanwu Hospital in Beijing , China , with the pre - approval of the Institutional Review Board . Invasive ductal carcinoma samples were obtained from patients undergoing surgical removal . The pathologically normal breast tissue was obtained 2 cm away from the tumour lesions in the same patient . Informed consent or assent was obtained from all patients and / or their parent or legal guardian . To measure the nuclear volume within surgical tumour samples , these samples were sectioned and fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 1 h . The central section crossing the tumour mass centre was then stained with Hoechst 33342 ( Sigma , 14533 ) for 1 h to visualize cell nuclei and washed three times with PBS . The 3D structure of the tumour slice was imaged with confocal microscopy and the volume was calculated as described above . To exclude the lymphocytes from the analysis , we labelled the pan - cytokeratin ( a common epithelial cell maker for humans ; Thermo Fisher , MA5 - 13156 ) in patient samples using antibodies and found that the tumour tissue indeed contains many pan - cytokeratin - negative cells , which suggests non - cancer cells ( Supplementary Fig . 13a ) . However , we rarely find lymphocytes near the invasive acinar - like structures , and almost all of the cells within the structure are positive for pan - cytokeratin ( Supplementary Fig . 13b ) . Mechanical and chemical perturbations . For osmotic compression experiments , PEG ( 300 MW ; Sigma , 90878 ) was added to complete the culture media with a final concentration of 2 % ( v / v ) either on day 3 ( long - term ) or day 5 ( short - term ) . To record the growth of the cancer organoids in the long - term experiments , we frequently recorded bright - field images of cancer organoids for the 10 days following osmotic compression , and the areas of the cancer organoids were quantified using IMAGEJ ( 1 . 52e ) . To study the effect of osmotic compression on cell nuclear volume and cell stiffness within the cancer organoid , we took high - resolution 3D images before and after a 12 h osmotic compression , and the cell nuclear volume and stiffness were analysed as described above . Alternatively , we added common drugs , including 0 . 5 μ M daunorubicin ( Sigma , D8809 ) or 5 μ M jasplakinolide ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , sc - 202191 ) , or overexpressed α - actinin ( Addgene , 54975 ) using Lipofectamine 3000 ( Thermo Fisher , L3000001 ) on day 3 to increase the stiffness of the cells within cancer NATure PHYSiCS | www . nature . com / naturephysics Articles NaTUre PhysiCs organoids . The growth of cancer organoids was recorded for 10 days . To investigate the effect of osmotic compression on organoid proliferation and apoptosis , we performed immunostaining of Ki67 ( Cell Signaling , 9129S ) and caspase - 3 ( Thermo Fisher , C10423 ) and found that these interventions did not affect cell proliferation or induce apoptosis in our system ( Supplementary Fig . 14 ) . To investigate the role of the PI3K pathway in the evolution of the cellular physical properties during the growing of the cancer organoid , we added 20 μ M LY294002 ( Sigma , L9908 ) to inhibit PI3K on day 3 , and the growth of the cancer organoids was recorded for 10 days thereafter . The cell nuclear volume and stiffness were measured on day 10 . To block the GJ communication between neighbouring cells within the cancer organoids , either 500 µ M carbenoxolone ( Sigma , C4790 ) or a mixture of ( 37 , 43 ) Gap 27 ( 300 µ M ; Anaspec Inc . , AS - 62642 ) and ( 40 ) Gap 27 ( 300 µ M ; Anaspec Inc . , AS - 62642 ) connexin mimetic peptides was added on day 3 . Statistics . A two - tailed Student’s t - test was used when comparing the difference between two groups . For comparison between multiple groups , one - way analysis of variance with the Tukey method was used . In all cases , * P < 0 . 05 ; * * P < 0 . 01 ; * * * P < 0 . 001 ; ns , not significant . In all box plots , the boxes represent the interquartile range between the first and third quartiles , whereas the whiskers represent the 95 % and 5 % values , and the squares represent the average .

Sample size Five to fifteen microtumors are measured in each experiment . The precise number used are given in the figure legend . Data exclusions For imaging process , only clusters started from a single cell were examined to synchronize the growth of the clusters . To avoid the effects from other clusters , clusters that have close neighbor clusters were also excluded . Replication All the measurements were done at least in three independent experiments to verify the reproducibility of the experimental findings ( precise number are given in the figure legend ) , and the results were consistent . Randomization Analyzed microtumors are randomly chosen . Blinding The investigators were blinded to group allocation during data collection and analysis for osmotic pressure and drug perturbation results .
