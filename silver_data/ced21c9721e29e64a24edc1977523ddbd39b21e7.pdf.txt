Cantley 1 , 5 The rapid increase in genomic information requires new techniques to infer protein function and predict pro - tein – protein interactions . Bioinformatics identifies modular signaling domains within protein sequences with a high degree of accuracy . In contrast , little success has been achieved in predicting short linear sequence motifs within proteins targeted by these domains to form complex signaling networks . Here we describe a pep - tide library - based searching algorithm , accessible over the World Wide Web , that identifies sequence motifs likely to bind to specific protein domains such as 14 - 3 - 3 , SH2 , and SH3 domains , or likely to be phosphorylat - ed by specific protein kinases such as Src and AKT . Predictions from database searches for proteins contain - ing motifs matching two different domains in a common signaling pathway provides a much higher success rate . This technology facilitates prediction of cell signaling networks within proteomes , and could aid in the identification of drug targets for the treatment of human diseases . The ability to accurately integrate proteins into signaling pathways is critical for functional annotation of genome sequences , as well as for understanding the relevance of known and newly discovered pro - teins in human disease . At the level of protein architecture , sequences can be parsed into two basic components : modular structural domains capable of autonomous function such as catalytic domains , DNA binding domains , and protein – protein interaction domains 1 ; and short linear sequence motifs that mediate binding to domains or become covalently modified to regulate location or activity . Proteins in signaling cascades generally contain one or more of each compo - nent , constituting a theoretical basis for cascade organization . For example , the catalytic domains of activated receptor tyrosine kinases autophosphorylate tyrosine - containing motifs outside the catalytic domain . Signaling proteins with SH2 or PTB domains bind to these motifs in the tyrosine - phosphorylated receptor . These proteins , in turn , become phosphorylated , altering their function or recruiting additional signaling molecules into the complex . This coupling of stoichiometric binding via short motif sequences along with catalyt - ic activation through covalent protein modifications allows high fidelity and amplification in the signaling process . Bioinformatics - based methods of sequence alignment and profil - ing 2 , 3 and Hidden Markov Models 4 dramatically improve the recog - nition of modular signaling domains from primary structure . In contrast , little progress has been made in developing accurate meth - ods that predict short linear sequence motifs that these domains rec - ognize within proteins in a genome - wide manner . The optimal amino acid sequences phosphorylated by protein ser - ine / threonine and tyrosine kinases , or recognized by modular signaling domains can be experimentally determined from oriented peptide library and phage display experiments . Both techniques involve screen - ing libraries for specific peptides or peptide – phage fusion proteins that bind tightly to a modular signaling domain . In addition , the optimal protein kinase substrate motif can be determined by enriching for and sequencing phosphorylated peptides following the kinase reaction . In many instances , the optimal peptide sequence motifs determined by these methods closely match the corresponding phosphorylation / binding sites on intact proteins when these have been determined experimentally . Though providing retrospective confirmation , these observations do not address whether the opti - mal peptide motifs alone can accurately predict phosphorylation and binding sites on proteins a priori . Both methods screen a collection of degenerate peptides involving 10 7 – 10 13 amino acid sequences with all amino acids ( except cysteine and sometimes tryptophan ) , at each degenerate position . In peptide library screening , the entire ensemble of phosphorylated ( for kinases ) or bound ( for binding domains ) peptides is sequenced to reveal statis - tically significant preference values for each amino acid at each posi - tion within a motif . These preference values can generate sequence profile motif matrices in which favorable or unfavorable contributions from individual amino acids are weighed quantitatively . We devised a profile scanning algorithm to investigate whether these experimentally based motif profiles can accurately identify motifs within protein sequences . The algorithm evaluates individual sequence queries or scans entire protein databases via a World Wide Web interfaced program , Scansite ( http : / / cansite . bidmc . harvard . edu / cantley85 . phtml ) , returning a sorted list of top - ranking matches for signaling motifs , and a site score that describes the quality of the match . Information from this search allows proteins to be incorpo - rated into known signaling pathways , or new signaling pathways to be constructed from predicted component molecules when search - ing across an entire proteome . Results and discussion The motif profile scoring algorithm . To identify potential motifs within a protein query , the sequence is scanned to identify amino acid residues critically invariant for a particular motif , that is , all ser - ine and threonine residues as potential serine / threonine kinase phosphorylation sites , and all tyrosine residues as potential SH2 1 Division of Signal Transduction , Department of Medicine and 2 Department of Surgery , Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center , Harvard Institutes of Medicine , 10th Floor , 330 Brookline Ave .

Each putative site is quantitatively scored using a 15 - residue window centered on the invariant residue . A selectivity value χ i is assigned to each amino acid at each position in the motif , using a motif - specific position - dependent amino acid matrix from peptide library and phage display experimental data ( see Experimental Protocol ) . Bit scores , defined as ln ( χ i ) / ln2 , are derived for each position i , and a raw sequence score S raw = Σ [ ln ( χ i ) / ln2 ] / i ( i = 1 , ≤ 15 ) is calculated , where normalization over the number of scored positions , i , partially corrects for edge effects at the N and C terminus of the protein . Raw scores are compared with the best possible score for each motif , S opt , giving the final sequence scores , S f = ( S opt – S raw ) / S opt . The S f value for each motif site within the query sequence is compared to pre - tabulated scores for all possible sites for that motif within all vertebrate sequences in SWISS - PROT to derive a percentile rank . A query site is tentatively scored as a “hit” if the S f value falls within the top 0 . 2 % ( high stringency ) , 1 % ( medi - um stringency ) , or 5 % ( low stringency ) of all scored sites within ver - tebrate SWISS - PROT ( ref . 5 ) . The program contains > 50 matrices optimized for many inten - sively studied protein kinases and protein interaction domains , including serine / threonine kinases , protein tyrosine kinases , SH2 domains , SH3 domains , PTB domains , PDZ domains , and 14 - 3 - 3 proteins , and will be continually updated as new matrices become available from experimental data . Most matrices are based on results using an oriented peptide library technique developed in the laboratory 6 – 8 . The Scansite program . Figure 1 shows typical program output , detailing results for human epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) as an example . Modular signaling domains within the query protein are first identified using Pfam 9 , and boundaries indicated in a linear cartoon ( Fig . 1A ) . Motif sites , denoted by vertical lines , show an abbreviated name for the identified motif at the corresponding position . A plot of surface accessibility calculated using the method of Emini et al . 10 and the amino acid fractional surface probabilities of Janin et al . 11 is shown below the cartoon , along with a sequence ruler . The default scan condition reveals only motifs scoring in the top 0 . 2 percentile . At this cutoff most matrices fail to score " hits " in EGFR . Many of the predicted sites shown have been previously con - firmed from in vivo or in vitro experiments , including Y1173 , a major tyrosine autophosphorylation site 12 ; T654 , a PKC phosphorylation site 13 ; T669 , a MAPK phosphorylation site 14 ; Y1068 , the binding site for the Grb2 SH2 domain 15 ; and Y1148 / Y1086 , the major and minor binding sites for the Shc PTB domain 16 . Additional EGFR autophosphorylation sites at Y1068 / Y1148 ( ref . 12 ) and the PLC γ SH2 - binding site , Y992 ( ref . 17 ) are identified at medium - and low - stringency scoring . Clicking on the protein cartoon brings up a table ( Fig . 1B ) detail - ing the motif site positions , their S f score , percentile rank , the sequence segment containing the motif , surface accessibility , and a link to GeneCard 18 for the relevant signaling module for which the motif was found in the query .

Clicking on the sequence seg - ment shows the motif within the entire query sequence , compares the S f score and percentile rank for the query protein with several known targets for the signaling module recognizing that motif , and permits a BLAST search 19 with the motif - matching sequence in the query . Confidence in motif assignment is bolstered when the BLAST search reveals conservation of the motif within related protein fami - ly members or in the same protein within different species , indicat - ing a functional interaction . We have observed relatively few false - positive " hits " using the 0 . 2 percentile scoring threshold . For example , no sites are identified within the extracellular domain of the EGFR ( amino acids 1 – 654 ; Fig . 1A ) , nor within the extracellular and seven transmembrane seg - ments of the α 2 - adrenergic receptor , and only a single hit is found within the 531 N - terminal amino acids of the extracellular domain of the PDGF receptor ( data not shown ) . Similarly , human myosin heavy chain ( α - isotype ) scores only 2 " hits " within 1 , 939 amino acids , whereas IRS - 1 , an adaptor molecule phosphorylated at multi - ple serine / threonine and tyrosine residues that binds to multiple SH2 - containing proteins , scores numerous " hits " consistent with published mapping studies ( data not shown ) . These results suggest that motif - based profile scanning using oriented peptide library and phage display data can indeed be used to accurately pinpoint sites within individual proteins . The Scansite program also allows an entire protein database or database subset to be searched using pre - calculated motif profiles , or a customized motif profile entered by the user . To evaluate this , we scanned the 76 , 310 sequences within the vertebrate proteome subset of GenPept using the motif profile determined for the serine / threo - nine protein kinase AKT by peptide library screening 20 . Table 1 shows top - scoring proteins identified by our profile - matching algo - rithm . Most known in vivo AKT substrates , such as members of the Forkhead transcription factor family , glycogen synthase kinase - 3 , and endothelial nitric oxide synthase , scored in the top 0 . 3 percentile . In addition , many new potential AKT substrates were identified , including the protein kinases Clk2 and MEKK3 , the p53 - associated protein MDM2 , and the disease gene proteins Huntingtin and Tuberin . Whether these proteins are bona fide AKT substrates remains to be verified , although the predicted AKT phos - phorylation sites are conserved from humans to rodents . For comparison , we investigated a simple pattern - matching tech - nique of the type implemented by the widely used program PROSITE 21 for database screening with the consensus AKT motif , XXRXRXX - ( S / T ) - X , where each X position incorporates all amino acids with equal weighting . Pattern matching identifies 13 , 774 potential AKT sites within 9 , 502 proteins in vertebrate GenPept , with no way of identifying low - likelihood from high - likelihood sites . The Scansite program , based on experimentally determined amino acid weighting matrices , returns the results from a database search in a sorted list format showing the rank - ordered scores , iden - tification / accession number , and protein name , along with the posi - tion and sequence matching the motif profile . A submit button to the left of each protein allows direct entry into Scansite in single pro - tein search mode , revealing additional motifs within that query . This ability to follow database screening with detailed characterization of the best - scoring proteins for additional signaling motifs allows con - struction of complex signaling pathways in silico , that can then be tested experimentally .

Figure 2A shows the frequency distribution of individual sites within each database matching a given score for the AKT kinase motif , and reveals extremely similar global score distributions for all three database subsets . Figure 2B shows the cumulative per - centile of sites scoring at or below a certain score , yielding nearly superimposable curves . Because only a very small fraction of mam - malian proteins are in vivo substrates of AKT , one might only expect to see a higher frequency of protein “hits” for the mam - malian versus the bacterial or shuffled mammalian databases at the top end of the percentile ranking ( i . e . , the top 0 . 2 % of scores ) . Indeed , there is a significant elevation of the highest scoring ( left - most ) portion of the mammalian distribution that contains many known AKT substrates as discussed above ( Fig . 2B , inset ) . These results argue that the AKT motif matrix from peptide library screens teases out a subset of serine / threonine residues in mam - malian proteins that have evolved in higher eukaryotes as sub - strates of AKT or closely related serine / threonine kinases . Close matches to the motif are found less frequently in randomized mammalian databases or prokaryotic databases , although some top - scoring sites are still identified within these databases when screened using a single motif profile . Similar results were also obtained when databases were scanned using the motif for the tyrosine kinase Src ( below , Fig . 3A ) . The general shape of these score - percentile curves closely matches that expected for an extreme - value distribution ( cf . refs 3 , 19 , and references therein ) . We reasoned that the accuracy , statistical likelihood , and biologi - cal importance of motif identification might be improved by simul - taneously scanning for dual motifs to elucidate coupled components of signaling pathways . For example , in eukaryotes several proteins bind the chaperone / adaptor protein 14 - 3 - 3 following AKT phospho - rylation . All entries within mammalian and bacterial GenPept were therefore scored simultaneously for optimal AKT phosphorylation and for 14 - 3 - 3 binding motifs ( Fig . 2C ) . The top - scoring mam - malian proteins in this search included numerous Forkhead tran - scription factor and BAD family members , scoring within the top 0 . 032 % and 0 . 164 % of sites , respectively . Both proteins are known to bind to 14 - 3 - 3 as a direct result of AKT phosphorylation 22 , 23 . Furthermore , dual - motif scoring reduced the number of high - scoring hits within the bacterial proteome to nearly baseline values ( Fig . 2C ) . Thus , database profile searching using combined AKT and 14 - 3 - 3 filters identifies a smaller set of protein targets , significantly elevates the distribution of high - scoring sites in the mammalian database over that of prokaryotes , and demonstrates how motif pro - file - based scoring can be used to construct hypothetical signaling pathways using bioinformatics . A global database search of bacterial and mammalian GenPept using the Src tyrosine kinase motif matrix is shown in Figure 3A . As with the AKT motif , there was a slight but significant elevation in the highest scoring ( left - most ) portion of the mammalian dis - tribution . In these highest scores are found many known Src and Src family sites in known substrates such as FYB , Cortactin , and Ras - GAP . Many protein kinases , particularly tyrosine kinases , con - tain additional modular signaling domains in addition to their kinase domains . To determine whether the motifs for these A B C A B Figure 2 . Statistical distribution of motif scores . ( A ) Bacterial ( dashed line ) , mammalian ( solid line ) , and randomized mammalian ( dotted and dashed line ) subsets of the GenPept database were scored for matches to the motif profile for the serine / threonine kinase AKT .

Ligands possessing both motifs might bind and activate the enzyme via an SH3 - directed interaction 24 while providing an excellent kinase substrate in cis . This search strategy dramatically elevated mammalian proteome scores , while reducing the number of similarly scoring bacterial proteins to nearly zero . Within the 35 top - scoring mammalian proteins ( from 72 , 302 proteins scanned ) are the Src substrate SAM68 and close homologs ( 8 hits ) , an SLP - 76 - binding protein ( SLAP130 ) that binds the SH3 domain and is tyrosine phosphorylated by Fyn ( 4 hits ) , and p130Cas , a protein tyrosine - phosphorylated in v - src transformed cells ( 4 hits ) . Thus , coupling multiple signaling modules within a single enzyme dra - matically increases specificity and selectivity for downstream sig - naling targets in prospective database searching , consistent with models in which multiple domains of signaling pro - teins cooperate to insure fidelity in signal transduc - tion . Profile searching weighs positive and negative amino acid selection at each position within a sequence motif from peptide - based experimental data . Applying this to mine proteomes could theoretically overestimate motif sites solely as a result of amino acid bias flanking serine , threonine , and tyrosine . To investigate this , amino acid frequencies in a 15 - residue window flanking serine , threonine , and tyrosine were examined and normalized to the global amino acid frequencies in bacterial and mammalian GenPept . Because only a small fraction of serine , threonine , and tyrosine residues are phosphory - lated in vivo , the pattern that emerges should be domi - nated by sequences where phosphorylation does not occur . Figure 4A shows kingdom / class variability in each flanking position , and a lack of perfect symmetry around the central serine , threonine , and tyrosine residues . More importantly , the distributions are skewed away from the most common amino acids criti - cal for functional recognition of many short signaling motifs . Figure 4B shows the distribution of residues flanking serine and threonine for all 173 known PKA phosphorylation sites in proteins within PhosphoBase , and residues flanking tyrosine for all mapped Src and EGFR sites ( a total of 51 sites ) . There is a striking paral - lel between positively selected residues in PKA , EGFR , and Src motifs and negatively selected residues within the mammalian database as a whole . Both mammalian and bacterial proteomes contain a relative paucity of critical residues for serine / threonine phosphorylation by basophilic and acidophilic kinases ( i . e . , arginine / lysine in the – 2 , – 3 , and – 5 positions and glu - tamic acid / aspartic acid spanning – 4 to + 4 positions , respectively ) , and the mammalian proteome contains a paucity of glutamic acid residues flanking tyrosine sites that are critical for tyrosine kinase phosphorylation ( Fig . 4B ) . Methionine , valine , isoleucine , phenylalanine , and leucine are also underrepresented in the Tyr + 3 position in the mammalian proteome . Most tyrosine kinases select these residues at + 3 , as do a subset of SH2 domains . Similarly , the bacterial proteome contains a large number of Thr - Pro sites that are significantly reduced in frequency in the mammalian proteome , where they could be potential targets for MAP kinase phosphorylation . Taken together , these observations argue that the recognition of motif sites by profile scan - ning is not dominated by sequence “noise” when applied to a rele - vant proteome , and suggest that negative selection against fortuitous motif sites may occur during evolution of signaling motifs . It is difficult to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of motif site prediction , partly because only a very small fraction of in vivo protein phosphorylation sites have been accurately mapped . Nevertheless , to provide a crude measure of accuracy we used Scansite to score all pro - tein sequences within PhosphoBase 25 and compared this with the known phosphorylation site data ( see Experimental Protocol ) . Approximately 70 % of the Src , Lck , calmodulin - dependent protein kinase II , casein kinase II , Cdc2 , PKA , and PKC phosphorylation sites reported in PhosphoBase are correctly predicted at the top 5 % cutoff level . Whether the ∼ 30 % of sites not predicted are due to limitations of Scansite or due to incorrect assignments of the kinase responsible for in vivo phosphorylation is unknown . In any event , this level of predictive accuracy for phosphorylation sites is comparable to that for algorithms used to predict protein secondary structure , and is sig - Figure 4 .

Amino acid sequence alone is not the sole predictor of phosphorylation . Other determinants include surface accessibility , spatial configuration , and kinase docking sites . Thus , dual matrix searches that include kinase site specificity and docking site specifici - ty ( i . e . , Src kinase and Src SH3 , Fig . 3B ) will improve prediction accu - racy . As with any bioinformatics tool , it is essential that users of the program verify all predicted motifs experimentally . In summary , this WWW - accessible profile - based searching algo - rithm identifies short sequence motifs within query proteins that regulate protein – protein interactions in cell signaling . The use of experimental data from oriented peptide library and phage display experiments allows a quantitative ranking of the motif score . The motif search can be applied to proteins of known and unknown func - tion , including disease gene products and drug targets identified in high - throughput screens . Predictive accuracy is significantly increased when query sequences are simultaneously searched for motifs corre - sponding to two domains within a single molecule of interest ( i . e . , Src ) or to two adjacent components of a signaling pathway ( i . e . , AKT and 14 - 3 - 3 ) . This technique , particularly when combined with other methods for predicting functional links between proteins , such as cor - related evolution 26 , cluster analysis of genome - wide messenger RNA ( mRNA ) expression patterns 27 , 28 , and the Rosetta Stone method of interpreting domain fusion events 29 , should greatly facilitate the pre - diction of protein interaction networks within complex proteomes . Experimental protocol Software was written in C , PERL5 , PHP3 / 4 , Javascript , and HTML . The motif - specific matrix of χ i values for each protein kinase or modular signal - ing domain was generated from raw selectivity values for each position - specific amino acid based on peptide library and phage display experiments as described 30 , 31 . Details of χ i calculations are provided as supplementary information in the Web Extras page of Nature Biotechnology Online . An S f value in the top 0 . 2 % was selected as the cutoff for high - stringency scoring to optimize the difference between the distribution of scores in the mam - malian versus bacterial databases ( cf . Figs 2 , 3 ) . The S f values for moderate - and low - stringency scoring ( top 1 % and 5 % of scores , respectively ) were chosen arbitrarily . Prokaryotic and mammalian subsets of GenPept were sorted by filtering raw GenPept sequence files . A randomized mammalian database was created by a stochastic single amino acid shuffling of the corresponding sequence in the mammalian proteome of GenPept . This involved constructing an empty array of the same length as each GenPept sequence , randomly selecting a residue from within the original sequence using RAND ( x ) seeded from a table of sRAND ( x ) values , placing it in position 1 of the array , and truncating the original sequence length by 1 . The second residue was then randomly selected from within the truncated sequence using RAND ( x ) and placed in position 2 , etc . RAND ( x ) was sequentially re - seeded using the next sRAND ( x ) value between protein entries . Comparison of individual sequences from the original and randomized databases using BLAST and FASTA verified randomization at the single amino acid level . A crude estimate of sensitivity and specificity was obtained using PhosphoBase , the best resource database of phosphorylation sites 25 . As many as 30 – 50 % of proteins encoded within the genome may be phosphorylated , corresponding to perhaps 50 , 000 sequences , each of which is likely to be phosphorylated at multiple sites . The most current version of PhosphoBase , however , contains only 1 , 052 sites , of which approximately one third involve data from the in vitro phosphorylation of peptides . Furthermore , many docu - mented protein phosphorylation sites are based on either in vitro phosphory - lation or loss of in vivo phosphorylation following mutagenesis rather than on direct phosphopeptide mapping .
