Here , we describe the general procedure for using FM dyes to study endosomal trafﬁcking in general , and synaptic vesicle recycling in particular . The dye , dissolved in normal saline solution , is added to a chamber containing the preparation to be labeled . Stimulation evokes exocytosis , and compensatory endocytosis that follows traps FM dye inside the retrieved vesicles . The extracellular dye is then washed from the chamber , and labeled endocytic structures are examined with a ﬂuorescence microscope . Fluorescence intensity provides a direct measure of the labeled vesicle number , a good measure of the amount of exocytosis . If the preparation is stimulated again , without dye in the chamber , dimming of the preparation provides a measure of exocytosis of labeled vesicles . With a synaptic preparation on hand , this protocol requires 1 day . INTRODUCTION FM dyes are widely used to image synaptic vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis . These dyes were originally synthesized by Fei Mao ( hence , FM ) at Molecular Probes in collaboration with our labora - tory , with the speciﬁc goal of imaging synaptic vesicles in living preparations 1 , 2 . Before the introduction of FM dyes , only sulfor - hodamine had successfully labeled these subdiffraction - limited structures 3 . Unfortunately , sulforhodamine does not work in non - reptilian systems . FM dyes are modiﬁed styryl dyes , which have been used as ﬂuorescent probes of membrane potential for many years ( reviewed in ref . 4 ) . Once FM dyes were shown to work well in several nerve – muscle preparations 1 , the dye was adapted for use in many other synaptic preparations . These included rat hippocampal culture 5 , Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction 6 , rat cerebellar granule cell culture 7 , goldﬁsh bipolar cell 8 , crayﬁsh neuromuscular junction 9 , snake neuromuscular junction 10 and brain slice 11 , 12 . Additionally , FM dyes have been used to label chromafﬁn cells 13 , anterior pituitary cells 14 , 15 , pancreatic cells 16 , 17 , yeast 18 , lung epithelia 19 , intestine epithelia 20 , fat adipocytes 21 and plant cells 22 . The utility of FM dyes relies on several key structural features of the molecule ( Fig . 1 ) . First , the tail region is lipophilic and causes the dye to partition into lipids and other hydrophobic domains . Second , the middle region contains two aromatic rings that create the ﬂuorophore . The number of double bonds in the bridge connecting the two rings determines the ﬂuorescence spectrum of the dye ; bridges with more double bonds shift the emission spectrum to the red . The excited - state charge transfer across the conjugated region of the molecule is solvent polarity - dependent . In polar solvents such as water , quantum yield is reduced by more than two orders of magnitude compared to non - polar solvents , such as membranes . Thus , virtually the entire signal is emitted by dye molecules in membranes ( or other hydrophobic environments ; some FM dyes have been shown to bind to lipophilic proteins such as prolactin in rat pituitary lactotrophs 23 ) . Third , the FM dye’s positively charged head group prevents the dye from ﬂipping across the membrane . Thus , once dye is trapped inside a vesicle , it can escape from the cell only by exocytosis of the vesicle . FM dyes are relatively easy to photoconvert , making it possible to identify ultrastructurally the location of the dye in cells . A discus - sion of the photoconversion process is outside of the scope of this protocol and the methods may be found elsewhere 24 – 26 . Labeled synaptic vesicles typically contain a few hundred dye molecules , nearly all of them in the membrane , and only a few at most in solution 24 . During exocytosis of a labeled vesicle , dye molecules rapidly diffuse into the surrounding plasma membrane and then , over a period of a few seconds , departition into the extracellular solution , losing ﬂuorescence 27 , 28 . The loss in ﬂuores - cence intensity is used to quantify the amount and rate of exocytosis . The FM dyes are stable , non - toxic and relatively easy to use . Even 24 h after staining , labeled synaptic vesicles can be unloaded by nerve stimulation 29 . The dyes are not inert , however , but can bind to and block both nicotinic 30 and muscarinic acetylcholine recep - tors 31 , and pass through and block mechanotransduction channels in hair cells of the cochlea ( refs . 32 , 33 but see ref . 34 ) . Molecular Probes ( an Invitrogen company ) offers several differ - ent FM dyes designed for different applications ( see Table 1 ) . FM 1 - 43 is the most widely used dye and works with ﬂuorescein optics . FM 4 - 64 was designed to use different optics ( rhodamine ) , which makes it useful for dual labeling with green ﬂuorescent protein 35 . The emission spectra of FM dyes are broad compared to many other ﬂuorescent labels ; thus , controls for bleedthrough into other emission channels are always necessary when using an FM dye with another dye . The Molecular Probes website provides a spectrum viewing tool for comparing spectra of a wide variety of ﬂuorescent probes including FM 1 - 43 and FM 4 - 64 ( http : / / www . probes . invitrogen . com / resources / spectraviewer ) .

That is , a chemically pure FM dye may appear as different colors in different structures , evidently reﬂecting differences in the microscopic environments into which FM dye molecules penetrate 1 ( Johnson , J . M . & Betz , W . J . Biophysical Society Meeting , abstract 90 , ( 2006 ) ) . In addition to the FM dyes available from Molecular Probes , several ‘‘generic’’ versions of FM dyes are available from Biotium including Synaptogreen ( 1 - 43 ) and Synaptored ( 4 - 64 ) . Biotium sells ﬁxable dyes ( AM 1 - 43 and AM 2 - 10 ) that are designed to prevent dye loss during ﬁxation and permeabilization of labeled preparations . The ﬁxable dyes have been used successfully with low detergent concentrations ( 0 . 01 % ( vol / vol ) Triton - X 15 , 36 ) . Molecular Probes recently started offering ﬁxable versions of FM 1 - 43 and 4 - 64 as well . In some preparations , a several minute wash eliminates most background ﬂuorescence . Brain slices , on the other hand , are a special problem . The high density of surface membranes causes high background ﬂuorescence , which can be difﬁcult to wash out . This background can be reduced by adding a quencher ( e . g . , sulforho - damine 101 ( see ref . 12 ) ) , or by using a dye scavenger to bind to and remove background dye ( e . g . , ADVASEP - 7 , a b - cyclodextran derivative 11 ) . More recently , Winterer et al . 37 claimed improvements over both of the above methods by using two - photon laser scanning microscopy to reduce out - of - focus ﬂuorescence . Currently , FM dye is still probably the easiest way to label synaptic vesicles , but other methods have been developed and offer new and different opportunities . Fluorescently labeled anti - bodies have been used to measure uptake and movement of vesicles 38 , but cannot show unloading or exocytic rates . Synap - tophluorin ( spH , a pH - sensitive version of green ﬂuorescent protein connected to the vesicle snare protein synaptobrevin 39 ) has become more widely used , but requires either a system for transfection of the spH or a genetically modiﬁed organism with spH knocked - in . spH and other phluorin - tagged proteins , have revealed new aspects of synaptic vesicle endocytosis 40 – 43 . The protocol listed below describes the basic FM dye loading and unloading protocols . Although these steps have changed little since they were ﬁrst introduced , small reﬁnements in the loading and unloading stimulation times , or adjusting when and for how long FM dye is present have created numerous opportunities to study the synaptic vesicle cycle . Measurement of endocytosis is achieved by quantifying the amount of dye uptake during stimulation . Additionally , spontaneous vesicle cycling can be observed by applying the dye to resting terminals for several to tens of minutes 44 – 46 . The rate of uptake can be measured by washing away the dye at variable time points after the end of stimulation 29 . Less sticky dyes that wash out faster ( see Table 1 ) can facilitate this experiment . Once vesicles have been endocytosed , vesicle locations inside the cell can be measured in resting terminals simply by imaging or by using ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching 47 – 49 or ﬂuorescence correlation spectroscopy experiments ( FCS 50 , 51 ) . Exocytosis of labeled vesicles is monitored by measuring the decrease in ﬂuorescence during stimulation . Many of the methods utilizing FM dye labeling can be found in reviews on the topic 52 – 54 .

Preparing the synapse for labeling 2 | Prepare most neuronal cultures 2 – 3 weeks before labeling . Brain slices are prepared the day of labeling and should be allowed to recover from the dissection for about 1 h before adding FM dye . Neuromuscular junction preparations are dissected and prepared the same day as labeling .

NATURE PROTOCOLS | VOL . 1 NO . 6 | 2006 | 2917 PROTOCOL debris or damaged tissue will be strongly labeled by FM dye . A clean and healthy preparation is essential for a successful experiment . In culture preparations , recurrent activity should be blocked for all following steps with speciﬁc antagonists such as CNQX . Dye loading 3 | Add working concentration of dye to buffer or saline solution used with particular neuronal preparation ( see Table 1 for typical working concentrations for each dye ) . Addition of the dye will label exposed membranes immediately ( Fig . 2b ) . 4 | Stimulate synaptic vesicle exocytosis using nerve stimula - tion , ﬁeld stimulation ( using parallel platinum electrodes placed near the synapse ) , hypertonic sucrose ( typically 500 mM ) or a depolarizing solution ( high potassium – typically 50 – 100 mM ) . Table 2 provides some basic information on choosing a stimulation protocol . Any vesicles exposed to the extracellular space will be labeled by FM dye partitioning into the vesicular membrane ( Fig . 2c ) . The time required for stimulation varies depending on the preparation used and is typically 1 – 5 min . 5 | Let the nerve terminal recover in the presence of the dye to allow for complete endocytosis of all released vesicles . Depend - ing on the particular preparation , this may require up to 10 – 15 min ( Fig . 2d ) . Note : spontaneous exocytosis may occur during this step , possibly causing more dye uptake . m CRITICAL STEP In some nerve terminals including both central and peripheral nerve terminals , endocytosis occurs slowly ( bulk endocytosis 55 , 56 ) and washing the FM dye out of the sample immediately after stimulation will result in little or no vesicle labeling . In cases where stimulation is applied with high potassium treatment , a switch to normal saline containing FM dye is necessary for about 15 – 20 min for completion of endocytosis . 6 | Wash away the extracellular FM dye by exchanging the solution multiple times with fresh saline solution . This will remove excess dye in exposed membranes ( Fig . 2e ) . m CRITICAL STEP Washing should continue for at least 15 min before imaging to minimize background ﬂuorescence and to allow all endocytosed membrane to reform into release - competent vesicles 57 . Spontaneous exocytosis may occur during this step , possibly resulting in some dye loss before imaging begins . Therefore , the length of this step should remain same for all experiments performed . Some laboratories use low - or zero - calcium solutions during the wash step to minimize spontaneous release ( Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction 58 ) . Application of ADVASEP - 7 ( 1 mM ) may shorten wash times ( hours to minutes in some slice preparations 11 ) and reduce background ﬂuorescence . Endocytosis should be allowed to complete before addition of ADVASEP - 7 ( see Step 5 ) . Use of ADVASEP - 7 and sulforhodamine to reduce background has seen some use in culture and little use in acute nerve – muscle preparations where just a 15 min wash is usually sufﬁcient . Imaging7 | Place the sample under a ﬂuorescence microscope and set optics to ﬂuorescein ( FM 1 - 43 , 2 - 10 and 1 - 84 ) or rhodamine ( FM 4 - 64 and 5 - 95 ) . As mentioned in INTRODUCTION , some shifting of the emission spectra may occur depending on the dye’s microscopic environment . The signal for the FM 1 - 43 family of dyes may be stronger in a typical rhodamine emission channel . puo r G gn i h s il bu P e r u t a N 7002 © n a t u r e p r o t o c o l s / m o c . e r u t a n . www / / : p tt h a b c d e f Figure 2 | Typical FM dye experiment .

Stimulation type Overview Comments Direct stimulation Electrical stimulation of nerve using an electrode , ﬁeld stimulation using electrodes placed near the synapse , or stimulation through a patch directly on the terminal Very controlled amount of vesicle release ; may be technically difﬁcult in some preparations Hypertonic sucrose 500 mM sucrose osmotically stresses the membrane and causes fusion of docked vesicles Loads selectively , vesicles docked at the plasma membrane High potassium Application of higher than normal concentration of potassium to depolarize the neurons ( typically 50 – 100 mM ) Less controlled and non - physiological but easily labels all terminals from many neurons at once 2918 | VOL . 1 NO . 6 | 2006 | NATURE PROTOCOLS PROTOCOL Using long - pass emission ﬁlters ( see EQUIPMENT ) will collect all emitted light wavelengths from FM 1 - 43 . However , in cases where dual imaging or choice of ﬁlter sets is limiting , use whichever ﬁlter set ( FITC or rhodamine ) produces the strongest ﬂuorescence for the FM 1 - 43 signal , so that excitation intensity can be minimized ( see below ) . 8 | Image total ﬂuorescence levels to quantify the relative number of synaptic vesicles endocytosed during the stimula - tion and recovery periods ( Steps 4 and 5 ) . m CRITICAL STEP It is important to reduce excitation intensity reaching the sample because phototoxicity can be a problem with FM dyes . The light reaching the sample should be reduced to the point where detection of 7 – 8 bits of dynamic range is achieved ( meaning the brightest pixel is 200 – 300 counts higher than the dimmest pixel ) . Reducing the light reaching the sample will also minimize any photobleaching of the FM dye resulting from the image collection . ? TROUBLESHOOTING Dye unloading 9 | To image vesicle release , start by collecting several control images . Next stimulate synaptic vesicle exocytosis ( as in Step 4 ) while imaging . As vesicles containing dye exocytose , dye releases into extracellular space and quickly washes away ( Fig . 2f ) . Any loss in ﬂuorescence measured during stimulation is indicative of the rate and amount of synaptic vesicle exocytosis . Note : to image exocytosis during stimulation in nerve – muscle preparations , a drug such as curare should be added to prevent muscle contraction . ? TROUBLESHOOTING 10 | Exhaustively stimulate the nerve terminal ( either prolonged nerve stimulation or repeated high potassium applications ) to unload completely all releasable FM dye . Any dye remaining after this step can be used as the terminal background level . This background contribution has been attributed to non - vesicular ﬂuorescence as well as non - releasing vesicles 26 . m CRITICAL STEP To quantify observations made on preparations loaded with FM dye , terminal background levels must be measured . This step allows for measurements in Steps 8 and 9 to be attributed to activity - dependent , recycling synaptic vesicles . Analysis11 | Quantify the amount of ﬂuorescence in each terminal for each time point . Using image analysis software ( ImageJ is a commonly used , open source freeware with a large community of contributors ; http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / ) , outline the nerve terminal and record the ﬂuorescence intensity inside the region . 12 | Measure the ﬂuorescence in the image background or non - synaptic area of the image . The background is attributed to non - terminal FM dye , autoﬂuorescence or image detector settings . Subtract this value from the terminal ﬂuorescence for each time point . The resulting background - subtracted ﬂuores - cence reﬂects the amount of vesicle release . 13 | Use the ﬂuorescence in the control images taken before stimulating the preparation to measure any loss of ﬂuores - cence as a result of imaging . Any measurable loss is likely due to photobleaching of the terminal .

Fluorescence plotted versus time . The ﬂuorescence should be mostly ﬂat before stimulation begins . Any reduction in ﬂuorescence before stimulation is likely a result of photobleaching or spontaneous release . See PROCEDURE for ways to reduce these two possibilities . During stimulation ( red line ) , the ﬂuorescence will decay during a timescale t depending on the preparation .

Therefore , the decline in ﬂuorescence during destaining needs to be corrected to account for photobleaching .

TROUBLESHOOTING Troubleshooting advice can be found in Table 3 . ANTICIPATED RESULTS Imaging ( Step 8 ) should reveal ﬂuorescently labeled terminals ( Fig . 3a , b ) . Unloading ( Step 9 ) should result in ﬂuorescence loss over time ( Fig . 3c , Supplementary Video 1 online ) . Depending on the particular synapse under study and the stimulation protocol used , the rate of destaining may vary dramatically . Figure 4 shows a plot of ﬂuorescence decline during time t . Table 4 lists typical timescales for t for a variety of synaptic preparations and stimulation protocols . These destain rates are typical for fully loaded terminals undergoing destain . Under these conditions , central neurons typically destain more quickly than motor nerve terminals . Different loading protocols designed to label speciﬁc pools of synaptic vesicles ( reviewed in ref . 59 ) , such as the readily releasable pool , will result in quicker destain rates . One terminal type not listed in Table 4 is the ribbon synapse . In these terminals , exocytosis rates may be measured during dye loading 60 .

Problem Possible reason Solution Step 8 : no dye visible in terminals Little or no exocytosis Terminal must be healthy for vesicles to recycle properly . In many terminals , checking for transmitter release by recording post - synaptically should conﬁrm the health of the terminal . In preparations where the nerve is stimulated to generate exocytosis , the health of the nerve may not be sufﬁcient to transmit the signal . Try using high potassium stimulation to load the vesicles Step 9 : dye does not unload during stimulation Phototoxicity If the total amount of loading is not important , try loading with a weaker stimulus . Fewer FM dye molecules in the excitation light will reduce photodamage . Otherwise , take images farther apart in time to reduce the amount of light reaching the sample TABLE 4 | FM dye destain times .
