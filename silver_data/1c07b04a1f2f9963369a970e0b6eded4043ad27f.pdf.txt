These approaches do not allow scientists to search on the deeper seman - tics of scientiﬁc resources , or to discover resources on the basis of the scientiﬁc approaches taken . This article evaluates a user interface that allows users to discover scientiﬁc resources through structured knowledge in the form of ontologies describing the domain and the scientiﬁc knowledge inherent within the scientiﬁc resource , and also through informal user tags . These combined capabilities provide scientists with new and powerful options for resource discovery . A qualitative user evaluation explored how scien - tists felt about the approach for resource discovery in the context of their scientiﬁc work . The study showed that marine scientists were enthusiastic about the capabilities of such an approach and appreci - ated the ability to browse the visual structure of the knowledge and query on scientiﬁc method but , overall , preferred the use of tags over ontologies . The exploratory nature of the user study was used to identify future directions for such improvements . 1 Introduction Tools for the discovery of information resources that assist scientists in the advancement of science ( for example , publications , data sets and web services ) are , currently , predominantly focused around either keywords that are applied in an unstructured manner , or predeﬁned tax - onomies that can be inﬂexible . Such approaches do not capture the deeper semantics of a sci - entiﬁc resource , and are thus limited in their ability to allow scientists to discover resources on the basis of rich domain knowledge or scientiﬁc approaches taken .

This application was developed by the authors with a view to demonstrating how sci - entists working in geoscientiﬁc domains might be given tools to search for scientiﬁc resources on the basis of their scientiﬁc content . The approach is underpinned by ontologies of scientiﬁc knowledge ( describing aspects like scientiﬁc models , analysis methods , processes , conclusions and theories ) and of domain knowledge ( in this case , the marine domain ) . The evaluation approach was qualitative in nature and involved observation and in - depth interviews with a small number of scientists working in the marine domain . The goal was to determine the strengths and weaknesses of this approach to resource discovery , and to identify future direc - tions for the development of discovery tools for geoscientiﬁc knowledge infrastructures . A qualitative approach was taken in order to allow participants to direct areas of focus ( in regard to both strengths and weaknesses ) , rather than imposing a quantitative framework of questions that were mandated by the researchers , and to gain a detailed understanding of the issues of relevance . Although the interface provides a number of functionalities to offer a com - plete user experience , the focus of the evaluation was on two aspects of the user interface : 1 . The use of ontologies for querying and the comparison of the ontology approach to a more informal approach of querying using unstructured user - deﬁned tags ( keywords ) ; and 2 . The ability to query on both domain knowledge and scientiﬁc knowledge ( information about the scientiﬁc method , models or approaches used ) . The outline of this article is as follows : Section 2 presents a user scenario to illustrate the kind of problem this approach might address ; Section 3 provides a brief summary of current work in the area of tools for scientiﬁc resource discovery ( with particular reference to the geo - sciences ) ; Section 4 describes the COMPASS interface and explains how it differs from and extends current work ; Section 5 explains the method that was adopted for the user study ; Section 6 presents the results and recommendations from the user study and Section 7 is a dis - cussion of the results and future directions . A brief summary of the underlying architecture and information models that underpin these discovery tools is provided in Section 4 . 4 , and the interested reader is referred to Stock et al . ( 2012 ) and Stock ( 2009 ) for details of those aspects . Stock et al . ( 2009 ) provides an over - view of the system and user interfaces that are reported and evaluated in more detail in this article . 2 User Scenario A scientist wishes to examine the environmental impact of a proposed port extension in the Severn Estuary in the UK , but would also like to consider environmental alternatives to the development and the ways in which the impacts of the development may be offset . She is par - ticularly interested in the hydrography of the dredged channel that is proposed , and would therefore like to identify information resources that relate to the current hydrography , along with marine tidal models , in order to evaluate expected impacts of the development . In par - ticular , she is interested in information derived using automated image analysis techniques from passive sonar devices , as she would like to extend such approaches to predict the impacts of the proposed channel and other alternatives . While this is her initial focus , she would also like to consider other related work in differ - ent ﬁelds , so that she can be sure that she is fully aware of the methods that might be suitable Finding Science with Science 613 © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd Transactions in GIS , 2013 , 17 ( 4 ) to address the problem . She is aware that other researchers have worked on similar problems , but does not have expertise in all of the measurement and analysis approaches , so hopes to identify potential collaborators for the project . 3 Related Work The work described in this article brings together a number of different strands of research and application in different ﬁelds , addressing the issue of displaying scientiﬁc resources ( for example , publications , data sets and web services ) in ways that enhance discovery to support the scientiﬁc process . This section brieﬂy reviews previous work in these strands and is fol - lowed by the presentation of the COMPASS discovery interface , which illustrates how these strands are addressed by the current research . 3 . 1 Resource Discovery Tools Currently , the most dominant method for scientists to discover resources involves searching on keyword - based Internet search engines like Google ( including Google Scholar ) , combined with keyword searches in library databases . Attempts have been made to extend these approaches with more advanced search and social networking capabilities , providing researchers with the ability to connect and communicate with each other . Examples include the following : • ResearchGate ( http : / / www . researchgate . net ) ( Herring 2011 ) is a social networking site for researchers that includes semantic search capabilities . It is focussed on making and manag - ing contacts , discussions and connecting with people . Members can list their publications ; and it provides access to publications from the major literature databases using semantic correlations , and provides recommendations for similar publications . It also does text matching based on abstracts that have similar themes using semantic methods , and is thus more advanced than keyword searches . • Mendeley ( http : / / www . mendeley . com ) ( Henning and Reichelt 2008 ) is a desktop download for managing publications ( the researcher’s own and those of other researchers ) . It pro - vides a number of functions for analysing research trends . Tools for identifying the most popular authors , papers , journals and tags and various other statistics about use of publi - cations are available . • WikiProfessional ( http : / / www . wikiprofessional . com ) ( Giles 2007 ) is a tool for the medical research community that allows medical and biological concepts to be viewed , and links followed to related concepts and publications . Its visualizations are mainly in the form of lists and histograms that show how closely related different terms are . • Zotero ( http : / / www . zotero . org / ) is a tool for collecting and organizing research sources ( publications , web pages , etc . ) . It provides simple reports , generates citation lists , and ﬁnds references on browsed web pages , but beyond that it has limited functions for resource dis - covery , querying or visualization . • BioPortal ( http : / / bioportal . bioontology . org ) is a site for accessing multiple biomedical ontolo - gies , and also provides functionality to search for publications by ontology concept , with ontology annotations for the publications being automatically generated by the system . These resource discovery tools focus mainly on the discovery of publications . However , scientiﬁc datasets and web services for the provision of data and functions also play an important role in the scientiﬁc process . Such data sets and web services are particularly 614 K Stock et al . © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd Transactions in GIS , 2013 , 17 ( 4 ) important in the context of geographical and environmental research , as they often describe and illustrate scientiﬁc models and research results that may be used by other researchers . Research communities working in these areas have expended some effort in recent years in trying to enhance discovery of these scientiﬁc resources to support scientists . The inclusion of such resources in a scientiﬁc infrastructure has the added beneﬁt of opening the way for the future development of workﬂows that consist of multiple web services to achieve a par - ticular scientiﬁc outcome ( Berkley et al . 2005 ) . The myGrid consortium has developed a suite of tools designed to support scientists in their use of web services , including tools for designing and executing workﬂows ( for example , Taverna ) and for sharing workﬂows and data with scientists ( for example , myExperiment ) . These tools have focussed on use in bioinformatics ( Wolstencroft et al . 2007 ) , but are also being applied to geographic information , for example in the soils area ( McLeod et al . 2009 ) . KEPLER is another system that supports scientists in deﬁning workﬂows in a range of domains ( Ludäscher et al . 2006 ) . Bowers and Ludäscher ( 2004 ) have combined ontologies with workﬂows by using ontologies to perform data transformations in the biodiversity domain , removing some of the burden of detailed data transformations from scientists . Finally , the PANGAEA data library links data sets to publications in the earth science and environ - mental domains ( Deis 2010 ) . The geospatial standards community has spent some years developing standards to support the discovery and exchange of scientiﬁc resources , including standards to describe : • Metadata about all kinds of resources , for example ISO 19115 / 119 ( International Stand - ards Organization 2003 ) ; • Web services that provide access to data , for example the OGC Web Feature Service ( Vre - tanos 2005 ) ; • Web services that execute scientiﬁc processes , for example the OGC Web Processing Service ( Shut and Whiteside 2005 ) • Data schemas , for example the Geography Markup Language ( Portele 2007 ) ; and • Metadata repositories to support management of spatial data infrastructures , also known as registries or catalogues , for example the OGC Catalogue Services Speciﬁcation ( Nebert and Whiteside 2007 ) . The availability of these standards and widespread international support have meant that many clients have been developed to support simple keyword - based discovery of such standards - based resources using their metadata and / or the self - describing nature of the OGC web services . However , infrastructures or clients that support more advanced semantic discovery of data sets and web services are rare . One such infrastructure is the Geosciences Network ( GEON ) , a cyber - infrastructure to support geoscience research . It has a services oriented architecture , and includes intelligent search , semantic data integration and visualization of earth science data . This work integrates heterogeneous geological data sets using ontologies ( Lin and Sinha 2006 , Lin and Ludäscher 2003 ) . Searching is by keyword , as well as other parameters , but ontology - supported search is the goal of future research . Other work in the geosciences uses ontologies to support semantic discovery of remote - sensing images ( Durbha and King 2005 ) as well as geospatial data connected to ontologies ( Lutz and Klien 2006 , Klien et al . 2006 , Wiegand and Zhou 2003 ) . Both the keywords and the semantics approaches described above focus search around static concepts or categories that exist in the domain of discourse . However , an approach has been proposed that organizes and discovers scientiﬁc resources on the basis of the research process rather than static thematic areas . This approach recognizes that much of the meaning in scientiﬁc data , models and publications comes from the scientiﬁc process that Finding Science with Science 615 © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd Transactions in GIS , 2013 , 17 ( 4 ) was used to create those resources . This process may be described textually in publications , but is not usually searchable ( Pike and Gahegan 2007 , Gahegan et al . 2009 ) . This proposed approach is explored further in this work . Table 1 summarizes the features of these tools in relation to the contributions of the current work . 3 . 2 Ontology Visualization Tools and Techniques A large number of tools for ontology visualization that can be used in both desktop and web environments have been developed and are reviewed by Katifori et al . ( 2007 ) . A number of techniques have been developed for graph simpliﬁcation and organization to make navigation and browsing of network structures easier ( Wong et al . 2011 , Ware and Mitchell 2008 ) . Many of these techniques have their origins in the biological sciences , as knowledge in this area is often organized in ways that are well suited to visualization in a tree structure . Ontology visualizations are most commonly used to show how knowledge within a domain is structured . For example , BioPortal ( http : / / bioportal . bioontology . org / ) is a portal to a large number of medical ontologies , and allows these ontologies to be visualized through its search function ) , rather than as a tool to assist with discovery of information about that knowledge . However , ResearchGate allows users to ﬁnd other researchers working in related areas , and provides a visualization of researchers and publications , but the visualization is not organized semantically . The Concept Web ( Giles 2007 ) provides a knowledge visualization to assist with knowledge discovery , but this takes the form of a histogram rather than a semantic network or ontology , and GEON supports discovery of resources through connected ontolo - gies ( Gahegan et al . 2009 . 3 . 3 Approaches to Description of Scientiﬁc Knowledge COMPASS attempts to support the process of discovery of scientiﬁc resources using a model of scientiﬁc knowledge through the components and processes from which it is constructed ( for example , analysis methods , hypotheses , scientiﬁc theories and models ) . Such discovery support allows users to discover scientiﬁc resources on the basis of the science , rather than the domain , supporting collaboration across different domains among people who are taking similar approaches , as well as more advanced examination of patterns in the process of the advancement of science . This approach depends on an adequate description of scientiﬁc knowledge and the process by which it is attained . Efforts to this end have included the creation of models of scientiﬁc knowledge ( Hars 2001 ) and discovery . Hars’ model has been implemented as a database and web server ( cybrarium , see http : / / cybrarium . usc . edu ) as a ﬁrst step towards a knowledge infra - structure ( Hars 1998 ) . The model includes concepts such as Idea , Method , Theory , Frame - work , Construct , Variable and Concept , as well as the notion of Statement , which may be a Proposition , Hypothesis , Deﬁnition , Axiom or Law . Work by Brodaric et al . ( 2008 ) has then used this work together with the DOLCE upper ontology ( Guarino 1998 ) to create an ontol - ogy of scientiﬁc knowledge , referred to as SKIo . Using a less complex framework , Gahegan and Pike ( 2006 ) also provide a set of different perspectives by which concepts in geographical domains can be viewed . These perspectives allow ontology concepts to be considered from different viewpoints , rather than requiring a single one size ﬁts all ontology . While these perspectives do not provide a rich model of the scientiﬁc process and its aspects , they do point out the importance of other types of information ( for example , researchers , tasks , tools ) . 616 K Stock et al . © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd Transactions in GIS , 2013 , 17 ( 4 ) T a b l e 1 C o m p a r i s on o f e x i s t i n g r e s ou r c e d i s c o v e r y t oo l s F un c t i on R e s e a r c h G a t e M e nd e l e y W i k i - P r o f e ss i on a l Zo t e r o B i o P o r t a l G E O N M y G r i d P r o v i d e s r i c h s e m a n t i c s e a r c h Y e s N o Y e s N o Y e s N o N o P r o v i d e s on t o l o g y b r o w s i n g N o N o N o N o Y e s Y e s N o P r o v i d e s s e a r c h b y s c i e n t i ﬁ c p r o c e ss / m e t hod N o ( e xc e p t i f m e n t i on e d i n a b s t r ac t t h r o u g h s e m a n t i c s e a r c h ) N o N o N o Y e s ( i f i n c l ud e d i n t h e on t o l o g i e s ) N o N o I n c l ud e s d a t a s e t s , w e b s e r v i c e s , e t c . i n a dd i t i on t o pub li ca t i o n s N o N o N o N o N o Y e s Y e s Finding Science with Science 617 © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd Transactions in GIS , 2013 , 17 ( 4 ) 3 . 4 User Tagging The use of informal user tagging to aid in searching has become popular in web applications ( for example , Facebook , YouTube ) , and has also been applied in the context of discovery of scientiﬁc resources ( for example , CiteSeer ) . The tagging approach allows users to assign their own tags to resources to aid in searching , and supports the creation of folksonomies ( Pink 2005 ) . Folksonomies are used in many popular web applications and provide a convenient approach to searching , but have limited internal structure . Currently , most approaches use either ontologies or informal user tagging , but there have been some attempts to combine the two philosophically different ideas ( Ankolekar et al . 2008 ) . This section has provided a brief summary of work in a number of different areas that relates to the research described in this article . Although these different efforts have approached different aspects of the same goal , the combination of these different aspects still requires further attention . Thus the work described herein extends and advances previous work by providing a new approach to discovery of scientiﬁc resources to support the process of the advancement of science . 4 The COMPASS Application The COMPASS application is intended to provide enhanced tools to scientists for discovery of scientiﬁc resources . More speciﬁcally , the objectives of the work were : 1 . To allow users to search based not just on keywords but on scientiﬁc approaches ( scientiﬁc models and theories , analysis methods ) , by displaying a scientiﬁc knowledge ontology . 2 . To allow users to ﬁnd resources based on semantically related terms ( parents , children , other types of connections ) , by displaying the domain and scientiﬁc knowledge ontologies . 3 . To compare the preferences of users for formal ontologies and the more common approach of informal user tags in searching for data . The application was implemented using three different interfaces in a web browser . Each interface is described in the following subsections . This article focuses on the user experience of the geospatial knowledge infrastructure , and the interested reader may refer to Stock et al . ( 2009 , 2012 ) and Stock ( 2009 ) for more information about the underlying design and imple - mentation of the infrastructure . All ontologies used in the geospatial knowledge infrastructure were created using Web Ontology Language ( OWL ) ( McGuinness and van Harmelen 2004 ) . 4 . 1 The Discovery Interface The COMPASS discovery interface displays six boxes that can all be resized to allow the user to construct his or her query . Five of the boxes can be used to specify different aspects of the query that the user is constructing . The sixth box displays the user selections from all the other boxes to give a preview of the query that is to be executed . The boxes can be used in any order ( and thus the discovery selection need not follow a set sequential order ) , and the user can return to any box and make a new or additional selection . Any , all or none of the boxes may be used in any one query ( although if none are used , the query will be very slow and return many results ) . The six boxes are explained in Table 2 , together with an example query based on the sce - nario described in Section 2 , using all of the boxes . A demonstration ﬁlm of this example query is also available for viewing ( http : / / www . youtube . com / watch ? v = qiNVDnME674 ) . 618 K Stock et al . © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd Transactions in GIS , 2013 , 17 ( 4 ) T a b l e 2 C o m po n e n t s o f t h e d i s c o v e r y i n t e r f ac e a nd e xa m p l e qu e r y Bo x P o s i t i on D e s c r i p t i on Exa m p l e qu e r y D o m a i n k no w l e d g e b y on t o l o g y T op l e ft T h i s bo x a ll o w s t h e u s e r t o i d e n t i f y on t o l o g y c on c e p t s o f i n t e r e s t i n t h e r e s ou r c e s s h e o r h e w ou l d li ke t o ﬁ n d .

A demonstration ﬁlm of the interface is also available ( http : / / www . youtube . com / watch ? v = 6h - reLHwRbI ) . The top left box shows the resources that Figure 1 Domain ontology querying Figure 2 User tag querying Finding Science with Science 621 © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd Transactions in GIS , 2013 , 17 ( 4 ) were returned by the query selected in the Discovery interface , and are grouped into Publica - tions , Data Sets and Journal Articles . For each resource , new tags may be added ( see Section 4 . 3 ) , and users may choose to view recommendations . The recommendations make use of the ontology knowledge representation of the system , and three different types of recommenda - tions are offered : Figure 3 Scientiﬁc knowledge ontology querying Figure 4 Temporal query 622 K Stock et al . © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd Transactions in GIS , 2013 , 17 ( 4 ) • Geography , showing other resources addressing a similar geographical area as the selected resource , ordered by spatial nearness ; • Domain , showing other resources that are connected to the same or semantically similar classes as the selected resource in the domain ontology ( Figure 7 shows recommendations based on Domain similarity ) ; Figure 5 Geographic query Figure 6 Preview query Finding Science with Science 623 © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd Transactions in GIS , 2013 , 17 ( 4 ) • Scientiﬁc Approach , showing other resources that use a similar scientiﬁc approach as the selected resource , using an algorithm based on matching classes and instances from the sci - entiﬁc knowledge ontology . Users may also view detailed information about the selected resource . This includes meta - data and also the means to access the resource itself via a link : • In the case of publications , the link opens either the publication itself or the login / payment page ( if the publication is not openly accessible on the Internet ) . The metadata itself comes from existing , standards - compliant digital library repositories that are queried dynamically by the infrastructure . 1 • In the case of datasets , the link opens a page listing the dataset , from which it can be downloaded . • In the case of web services , the link executes the web service . Figure 8 shows the input screen for an OGC Web Map Service , and once the user clicks ‘Execute’ , the map is dis - played according to the user speciﬁcation . In this implementation , users can execute web services separately , and the capacity to deﬁne and execute workﬂows that combine multiple web services is not provided , but the connection of the work to some workﬂow software would provide a useful additional function for scientists in the future . Following the example query from Section 4 . 1 , Figure 7 shows a set of resources that meet the selected query from the query preview box ( Table 2 ) . The resources that are visible in the top left window in Figure 7 are Publications , but other resources are listed further down in the box and may be accessed through the scroll bar . Figure 7 shows recommendations based on Figure 7 Results tab 624 K Stock et al . © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd Transactions in GIS , 2013 , 17 ( 4 ) Domain , which means that the bottom left window shows resources that were annotated with the same ontology domain concepts as the resource that is selected in the top left window . The detailed view on the right shows the Abstract and other metadata for the selected resource in the top left window . Figure 8 shows some web services that appear further down the list of resources for the example query . The listed services are Web Feature Services and a Web Map Service . The bottom left window shows recommendations based on domain for the selected service ( that is , resources that are annotated with the same ontology domain concepts ) , and the window on the right shows metadata for the web service . 4 . 3 The Tagging Interface The Tagging interface allows users to add new tags to a scientiﬁc resource , which are then dis - played in the Discovery tab ( domain knowledge by user tag box ) on subsequent loads . Tags are added by clicking on the ‘Add Tag’ icon in the Results interface ( Figure 7 ) , upon which the Tagging Interface is opened with the appropriate resource loaded . The Tagging Interface uses the third - party open source gnizr software ( http : / / code . google . com / p / gnizr / ) . This functionality was not a core part of the knowledge infrastructure and was not evaluated in this research . 4 . 4 Implementation The COMPASS project implemented a geospatial knowledge infrastructure , and this article focuses on a user interface to this infrastructure that supports discovery of scientiﬁc resources . Figure 8 Web Map Service execution Finding Science with Science 625 © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd Transactions in GIS , 2013 , 17 ( 4 ) This section brieﬂy describes the infrastructure , and more detail is contained in Stock et al . ( 2009 , 2012 ) and Stock ( 2009 ) . The architecture of the COMPASS infrastructure is based around ontologies and open standards . A number of ontologies with different purposes lie at its core ( Stock et al . 2012 ) : • Domain ontologies describing the marine domain ( in this case , but could cover any domain ) , displayed in the user interface to allow the ontology to be browsed ; • A scientiﬁc knowledge ontology describing the structure of scientiﬁc knowledge , displayed in the user interface to allow the ontology to be browsed ; • An information source ontology describing the structure of publication and dataset resources ; • OWL - S Web service ontologies describing the web service resources . The ontologies are stored in an ontology - registry ( Stock 2009 ) . The registry component of the ontology - registry is an interface to the ontologies that complies with the OGC Catalogue Services Speciﬁcation ( CSW ) ( Nebert and Whiteside 2007 ) and enables their content to be accessed alongside other repositories in an interoperable manner . Underneath the interface , the ontologies are stored in their native OWL ( text ﬁle ) format . In the geospatial knowledge infrastructure , each resource is described using an application ontology , and these ontologies drive the display of the scientiﬁc resources . The application ontologies contain instances of classes from an information source ontology to describe some of the metadata aspects of the resources as well as additional information like bounding box ( which describes the geographic area covered by instances in the dataset , whether they be lines , points or polygons ) , and also instances of classes from other ontologies ( the domain ontology and the scientiﬁc knowledge ontology ) to describe the semantics of the resource . For the pur - poses of this project , the application ontologies were created manually ( including their bound - ing boxes ) , but this was a cumbersome process . It is anticipated that for a fully operating infrastructure , tools for automatic creation of application ontologies from existing metadata repositories would be created , and methods to achieve this are becoming more advanced ( Noy et al . 2009 ) . However , basic metadata from existing repositories may need to be supplemented by the inclusion of detailed information about the scientiﬁc process , which requires under - standing of the science itself . This would be best done by the scientists who conducted the work , and it is hoped that an incentive system together with user - friendly tools would encour - age scientists to tag their work in this way . When the user selects his or her query options and clicks the search button , the user inter - face constructs a CSW query from the selections , which it submits to digital library repositor - ies conforming to Z39 . 50 ( http : / / www . biblio - tech . com / html / z39 _ 50 . html ) and OAI - PMH ( http : / / www . openarchives . org / pmh / ) standards , in order to access resources that are not yet described by ontologies in the infrastructure ( although resources retrieved this way are not semantically rich and therefore may not be retrieved through domain ontology selection unless the keywords coincidentally match ) , and also the knowledge management adapter that is part of the COMPASS infrastructure . The knowledge management adapter accesses the application ontologies for the resources through knowledge management middleware ( Jena ) , and retrieves the relevant resources . The application ontologies are also connected to relevant concepts in the domain and scientiﬁc knowledge ontologies , and resources are retrieved through these con - nections . The ontology connections are then used to provide recommendations , and more advanced functionalities are possible in future developments , making use of the inference over the ontologies . 626 K Stock et al . © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd Transactions in GIS , 2013 , 17 ( 4 ) 5 Method In software design and development , it is common to conduct user evaluations using quantita - tive approaches , to examine aspects such as efﬁciency , effectiveness and satisfaction ( Koua et al . 2006 , Frokjaer et al . 2000 , Hoffer et al . 1999 ) . However , the proposed approach to sci - entiﬁc resource discovery is at the early stages of its development , and presents a new approach to resource discovery that is not commonly available to scientists ( in particular the use of scientiﬁc knowledge as a search tool is not familiar ) . For this reason , an exploratory research method was adopted , that would allow us to examine how marine scientists felt about these new approaches to querying . Speciﬁcally , we wanted to examine how well the application could support scientists as they conducted their research using their own , ‘native’ approaches and processes ; whether scientists thought this was a direction that would be useful to them in conducting their science ; whether it should be pursued and if so , how we might direct future development of the approach . In order to extract this kind of meaningful data a qualitative rather than a quantitative approach was adopted . Previous research in human - computer interaction has shown that user - based evaluations which aim to understand how users interact with computer interfaces and measure usability indicators such as user’s attitudes and opinions beneﬁt from a qualitative approach ( Maquire and Sweeney 1989 , Sweeney et al . 1993 , MacEachren and Kraak 2001 , Bhowmick et al . 2008 ) . As Rubin ( 2008 ) argues , while numbers can tell us whether a product is effective , there is also a distinctive qualitative element to how usable something is , which is often difﬁcult to capture with numbers . User - testing through qualitative methods is also particularly beneﬁcial if : ( 1 ) a summative evaluation is sought , i . e . to determine the extent to which the product actually supports the user to complete the experimental task ; and ( 2 ) the product is at the simulation stage of devel - opment where the objective is to determine whether the speciﬁcation for the proposed systems meets the requirements ( Sweeney et al . 1993 ) ; what might be called an iterative design process ( Rubin 2008 ) , through which earlier studies such as Bhowmick et al . ( 2008 ) have shown quali - tative methods to be especially useful . Both of these criteria were relevant to the COMPASS application . In this study , as well as observing participants during the testing process , the structured interview was considered appropriate for extracting the kind of subjective information sought , for two speciﬁc reasons : First , interviews can employ the use of open - ended ques - tions , allowing interviewees to respond with their own means of expression , submitting their own views and value judgements . Qualitative methods such as the use of interviews are therefore ideal for such bottom - up exploratory analysis ( Hennink et al . 2011 ) . While quan - titative approaches could have been used to provide information about efﬁciency , speed , usability and to perform numerical comparison with existing keyword searches , we were interested in a deeper analysis of the way scientists thought about and used the tool , in terms of their own ways of conducting science and thinking about the scientiﬁc process . Again , qualitative methods are suitable for studying a topic from the perspective of the par - ticipants , rather than imposing an external set of measures ( Hennink et al . 2011 ) . Secondly , qualitative approaches which measure usability indicators such as attitudes and levels of enthusiasm and motivation , i . e . interviews and observation for the purposes of further devel - opment of the tool ( Sweeney et al . 1993 ) , are considered viable at the prototype stage of development . We observed and interviewed 12 participants , all of whom were marine scientists con - ducting research in the marine science ﬁeld . We recruited the participants by asking marine Finding Science with Science 627 © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd Transactions in GIS , 2013 , 17 ( 4 ) scientists who were involved in the project to recommend people who could be approached . Those people were approached and followed up once . About half of those approached agreed to take part . We visited them at their ofﬁces , recorded their actions and aimed to build up a rapport with them in order to get detailed information on their views of the application . This allowed us to gain a view of what they actually thought of the approach . Participants were not given payment or incentives . The use of a small number of non - randomly selected participants is appropriate in quali - tative research , because the goal is to understand the views of the participants in depth , and not to generalize to a wider population ( Hennink et al . 2011 ) . Similar themes and views ran through the interviews with the different respondents , and triangulation between the Microsoft Desirability Toolkit results and the open question parts of the user study supported the results , suggesting that sufﬁcient respondents had been included in the sample according to qualitative research methods ( Boyce and Neal 2006 ) . Participants varied in their age and level of scientiﬁc experience , and views of the application were relatively consistent across the participants . As discussed in Section 1 , while the interfaces present a number of different functions , the main focus of the evaluation was on the two most innovative aspects of the approach , being : ( 1 ) the use of formal ontologies for the querying of knowledge ( which was compared with the use of informal user tags for querying ; and ( 2 ) querying by scientiﬁc knowledge ( models , theo - ries and procedures ) in addition to domain knowledge . Therefore the user evaluation protocol demonstrated and allowed users to try all functionality , but the questions and evaluations address the three query functions : • Domain knowledge querying by ontology ; • Domain knowledge querying by user tags ; and • Scientiﬁc knowledge querying by ontology . The user evaluation protocol was as follows : 1 . The evaluator brieﬂy explained the purpose of the evaluation to the participant . 2 . The evaluator provided a brief ( 10 minute ) demonstration of the functionality of the application . This was the time required to demonstrate and explain all of the functionality of the application . 3 . The participant was given the opportunity to use the application freely in any way he or she chose for 15 minutes and keystrokes were recorded . This length of time was chosen in order to allow users to have a signiﬁcant amount of time with the application , to provide some focus but to avoid the boredom that might result from a longer period . The partici - pant was not given a speciﬁc task to complete , but was simply invited to explore , in line with the exploratory nature of the study . 4 . The evaluator checked with the participant that she or he had tried all of the main func - tions in the application to ensure that subsequent evaluation could be completed . The par - ticipant was given the opportunity to try any functions not previously tested . 5 . The participant was asked to complete the modiﬁed ( word list ) version of the Microsoft Desirability Toolkit ( MDT ) ( Travis 2008 ) for the three query functions of interest for the evaluation ( querying with the domain ontology ; querying with tags and querying with the scientiﬁc knowledge ontology ) . This involved being provided with a randomized list of 105 words , being asked to tick those that applied , then being asked to select the ﬁve that seemed most applicable . 6 . The evaluator conducted an interview with the participant , ﬁrst asking the participant to explain why he or she chose each of the ﬁve words selected in the previous step , using 628 K Stock et al . © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd Transactions in GIS , 2013 , 17 ( 4 ) in - depth interviewing techniques in which the participant was asked to elaborate as much as possible . The participant was then asked three open - ended questions : ( a ) Which aspects of the application did you like ? ( b ) Which aspects of the application didn’t you like ? ( c ) Would you like to make any suggestions for improvements ? This evaluation protocol was intended to provide method triangulation through two different methods : MDT and structured interviews based around the open - ended questions . 6 Results This section presents the results of the user evaluation , including consideration of the three speciﬁc query options , followed by the open - ended questions . Direct quotations from partici - pants are shown in square brackets and quotation marks [ “thus” ] . This section reports on the themes that emerged from the content analysis and encoding of the interview transcripts , along with the results of the MDT testing . 6 . 1 Views about Querying Options The MDT testing and the ﬁrst section of the interviews were focussed around each of the three querying options that were the focus of the evaluation . 6 . 1 . 1 Querying by domain ontology Figure 9 is a matrix showing the results of the Microsoft Desirability Toolkit ( MDT ) testing for all three query approaches . Matrices are often used to display results in qualitative research , and to allow patterns to be observed in a non - quantitative way giving value to individual judgements . Only the words that were selected by participants are shown ( out of the total 105 words available in the MDT ) , and they are organized into clusters of related words ( by the authors ) to facilitate interpretation . The grey shades indicate the number of participants who selected the word ( if more participants selected the word , the relevant square in the matrix is darker ) and each column represents a participant to allow patterns among participants to be observed . The words are broadly positioned with those that are positively associated towards the top of the matrix , and those that are negatively associated at the bottom . The matrix shows that a focus on the themes relating to complexity , clutter and confusion / frustration , and lack of reﬁnement / performance . The cluttered / busy / overwhelming cluster of words was also reﬂected in the themes emerging from the interviews ( see below ) , but the other faults were less prominent in the interviews . At the more positive end , clusters relating to the innovative / new / unconventional nature and to the engaging and stimulating nature of the query approach were also identiﬁed by par - ticipants as relevant to their experience . The interviews revealed more detailed information about the aspects of the approach that gave it these more positive qualities . Content analysis and encoding of transcripts of the ﬁrst part of the interviews ( addressing the reasons for selection of the MDT words ) revealed four main themes : 1 . Linkages and connections : These were mentioned repeatedly and participants said that they liked seeing the overall structure , the connections and linkages between different Finding Science with Science 629 © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd Transactions in GIS , 2013 , 17 ( 4 ) concepts in the domain ontology . They liked having an overview [ “like a family tree” , “a box of everything” ] , being able to see the overall structure in its entirety . This emerged as one of the most important and beneﬁcial aspects of the application . 2 . Possibilities for reﬁnement : The support for reﬁnement made possible by the domain ontology was seen as useful by several participants . To start out in one place and focus down , to review a search and then become increasingly speciﬁc without having to start the search from the beginning , were all different expressions of this same theme . 3 . Visualization : The concept of seeing a domain ontology as a hierarchy ( presented with the top node at the centre and child nodes arranged radially ) was considered intuitive and clear , prompted ideas and allowed in - depth and speciﬁc searching . 4 . Rationalization / simpliﬁcation : Participants expressed the wish to get rid of the things they were not interested in . The problem of overlap was mentioned repeatedly : [ “there is so much” ] . Figure 9 Participant - selected MDT word matrix 630 K Stock et al . © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd Transactions in GIS , 2013 , 17 ( 4 ) 6 . 1 . 2 Querying by tags The matrix ( Figure 9 ) shows a marked contrast to the participant responses for querying by domain ontology , in that the aspects considered relevant were focussed around the clean / clear / simple / efﬁcient cluster ; and also the easy - to - use / accessible / straightforward and appealing / attractive clusters . Criticisms of the querying by tags approach were much less pronounced than for the querying by domain ontology . Analysis and coding of interview transcripts relating to the querying by tags approach highlighted the following six themes : 1 . Simplicity of interface design : The design was clean , clear , attractive and [ “easy on the eye” ] . 2 . Ease of use : The function was simple and easy to use , much easier than the domain ontol - ogy . Several people said that they preferred it to the other approaches : [ “It’s the best one” ] . 3 . Proportional text sizing : The difference in size in the keywords was important in making the display attractive and useable . Some respondents said that they liked the difference in size and the way that it indicated the importance of the concept , while others said that they didn’t know what the difference in text size indicated . In fact , the text size is deter - mined by the number of resources that are tagged with that particular keyword . The mix of different types of tags ( subject areas , parameters , place names ) was seen as a good thing by most participants . 4 . Efﬁciency : This was mentioned by most participants as an advantage of this approach . It was considered quicker than the domain ontology and than typing in a search term . 5 . Prompts new ideas : As with the domain ontology , several participants also thought that this function prompted new thoughts [ “picked up several tags that you hadn’t considered before” ] , and promoted depth of search . 6 . Familiarity [ of approach ] : The approach was familiar to most , and one participant men - tioned that she liked the application of an approach from social networking to the scien - tiﬁc context . 6 . 1 . 3 Querying by scientiﬁc knowledge ontology The matrix ( Figure 9 ) showed a much more scattered range of words than for the other two querying approaches , with focuses in the frustrating / hard - to - use and time - consuming clusters , and to a lesser extent , the powerful / advanced cluster . Only about half of the users actually used this function ( due to lack of time and lack of understanding of its purpose ) , so some responses were based on the demonstration and their experiences with the domain ontology , which offers broadly the same functionality but with different subject matter and outcomes . This problem could have been addressed by varying the order in which participants reviewed the different query functionalities . The coding and analysis of the interview transcripts for querying by scientiﬁc knowledge ontology showed less support for this approach than for the other two approaches . Most par - ticipants were strongly in support of the idea of ﬁnding resources based on methodology or technique , and thought this was an important and powerful idea . However , the scientiﬁc knowledge ontology interface was not well regarded . In addition to the criticisms directed at the domain ontology visualization , the scientiﬁc knowledge ontology was found more difﬁcult to use because participants were not able to ﬁnd the terms they were looking for , and without knowing the ontology content , it was hard to navigate around to ﬁnd the correct term . Finding Science with Science 631 © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd Transactions in GIS , 2013 , 17 ( 4 ) 6 . 2 Open Questions The interview ended with three open questions . Participants were asked to identify aspects they liked , did not like , and to suggest improvements to the application . Overall , the responses were very positive and supported the analysis of the interviews regarding the speciﬁc types of querying ( see Section 6 . 1 above ) . Content analysis and encoding of the interview transcripts revealed the themes discussed in the following subsections . 6 . 2 . 1 What participants liked Participants particularly liked the overall approach , commenting on its power , innovative nature and the potential improvement over existing approaches . The following themes emerged : 1 . Visual interface : Participants liked the visual nature of the interface , and the presentation of the ontologies . 2 . Tagging approach : The tag cloud and its query method were popular . 3 . Overall search approach : Participants considered it an interesting , powerful and time - saving way to search for data , once it was understood . • [ “Very related to academia , you only get scientiﬁc publications or services related to your actual needs – no silly things . ” ] • [ “Prompted ideas , think broader than original search , open up whole range of other alternatives . ” ] • [ “Like the idea to be able to search for similar techniques elsewhere . ” ] • [ “Forces you to do a little more about your search – putting in a lot of effort but much more sophisticated results . ” ] 4 . Links , connections and interrelationships : The ability to visualise semantic links was con - sidered useful [ “Like the connection of the concepts – very intuitive . ” ] . 5 . Geographic querying : Participants liked the geographic query tool , both its operation and the functionality that it offered . The spatial and temporal querying functions were not speciﬁcally examined in the user study , as they were straightforward and the spatial querying in particular was considered to be a standard , familiar component of many geographic information querying tools . However , spatial querying was used by most participants and temporal querying by about half of the participants . In the open questions , participants identiﬁed the geographic search as being something they particularly liked , and these functions were used by most participants , suggest - ing their relevance ( and familiarity ) over and above the place - name tag selection . Recommen - dations based on geography were also offered and were used by most participants . 6 . 2 . 2 What participants did not like The following themes emerged from the interviews in regard to participants’ dislikes : 1 . Difﬁculty with functions / navigation : This theme related to usability problems and uncer - tainty over the way in which the interfaces worked . Many users pointed to the need for user help . 2 . System functions not working properly : Users pointed to cases in which functions did not work or were prohibitively slow [ “when you enlarge the boxes , when you click them to make them smaller again it jumps , not immediately back to the original size” ] . 632 K Stock et al . © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd Transactions in GIS , 2013 , 17 ( 4 ) 3 . Clutter / busyness : This ﬁnding conﬁrms the main themes identiﬁed in Figure 9 . 4 . Speciﬁc problematic aspects of the interface : ( a ) Format of results presentation . ( b ) The text autocomplete function in the ontology search box [ “it was thinking ahead of you” ; “the typing is horrible” ] . ( c ) The layout of the ontologies . ( d ) The preview query box : not visible enough and not well presented . 6 . 2 . 3 Suggested improvements In many cases , suggested improvements reﬂected the dislikes in Section 6 . 2 . 2 , with some addi - tional ideas for improvements . The following major themes emerged : 1 . Documentation / help / user manual / tutorial : Participants identiﬁed the importance of more context - sensitive help and a detailed user manual . 2 . Clear direction on expected path : One participant suggested the inclusion of a map or ﬂow chart showing how the boxes should be followed . However , this suggests some mis - understanding , as the boxes do not need to be followed in any particular order , and are a set of options that can be used or not as required . 3 . Need to correct problems relating to speed : This theme was a direct consequence of Theme 2 in Section 6 . 2 . 2 . 4 . Better display of ontologies . 6 . 3 Summary of Findings In summary , the main ﬁndings from the user study that may be useful in directing future devel - opment were : • Querying by tagging was best . It was efﬁcient , quick , clean , simple and easy to use . The dif - ferences in font size were an essential part of this . • The ability to view the entire structure and the linkages / connections between concepts when querying by domain ontology was considered powerful and beneﬁcial , but con - versely , the visualization was too cluttered and difﬁcult to use . The idea of querying by scientiﬁc knowledge ( speciﬁcally methodology or technique ) was considered useful , powerful and important , but this particular design and implementation ( using a scientiﬁc knowledge ontology ) was too complicated and difﬁcult . It is important to note that most users were much more accustomed to querying by tags than by ontologies ( domain or scientiﬁc knowledge ) , so were familiar with the concept and this may have affected the results . While the user interface was evaluated with only 12 participants , which is far fewer than would be used for a quantitative study , the results received from the 12 participants converged and there was general agreement among the participants . Furthermore , the agreement between the results from the MDT and the open questions in terms of the emerging themes provided method triangulation to further validate the methodological approach . 7 Discussion In Section 5 , three broad goals for the user study were identiﬁed : Finding Science with Science 633 © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd Transactions in GIS , 2013 , 17 ( 4 ) 1 . To examine how well the application could support scientists as they conducted their research using their own , ‘native’ approaches and processes ; 2 . To identify whether scientists thought this was a direction that should be pursued and if so ; 3 . To determine how future development of the approach should be directed . Speciﬁcally , two main aspects of the querying tools were of interest in the evaluation : the use of ontologies compared with the use of user tags ; and the use of scientiﬁc knowledge . The user study suggested that the parts of the application particularly useful in supporting the participating marine scientists in conducting research using their own particular approaches were : ( 1 ) the ability to view the entire structure and linkages of the domain knowl - edge ; and ( 2 ) the ability to query by scientiﬁc methodology or technique . These were sup - ported by the participants as directions that should be pursued , along with the tagging approach , which was popular . The study also identiﬁed clear deﬁciencies in the proposed approach , and this section goes on from these ﬁrst two conclusions and addresses the issue of the future direction that might be taken . 7 . 1 Domain Knowledge Querying through Ontologies and Tags Two alternative methods for querying based on domain knowledge were offered : ontologies and tags . Tags have been used on social networking and blogging sites for the last few years , and many studies have been made of their beneﬁts and usability ( Halvey and Keane 2007 , Hassan - Montero and Herrero - Solana 2006 , Rivadeneira et al . 2007 ) . In our work , we wanted to explore how useful they might be for scientiﬁc resource discovery , and how they compared to ontologies . The tags used were not restricted to domain concepts , but also included place names ( for example , Forth Estuary ) and parameters . Most participants considered this an advantage . The tagging approach was the most popular , and was widely supported , and thus is clearly a suitable candidate for future development . However , there were scalability problems as the number of tags becomes greater . Some approaches have been proposed to resolve or reduce this problem , including the following : • The introduction of a simple structure to the tags ( folksonomies ) ( Al - Khalifa et al . 2007 ) , in which users creating tags can specify relationships with other tags , creating a kind of hybrid between an ontology and informal tagging . In this case , some methods could be used to display subsets of tags and navigate among them , although this moves away from the beneﬁts of the tag cloud querying identiﬁed by participants . • The development of automated approaches for reduction or consolidation of tags . Some social networking applications display only the most popular tags ( Knauf et al . 2010 ) , so this approach could be adopted , with automatic re - tagging of more popular alternative tags using algorithms to identify semantically related tags . However , this would result in some loss of precision in expression of domain knowledge , considering that a limited number of tags would be expected to apply across a range of disciplines . The method for determining font size is likely to have the result that more general tags would be used more often and therefore appear larger . There is some evidence for this among the 200 tags in the prototype . The larger tags are often general concepts ( ecology , bathymetry ) , while very speciﬁc tags like enterococci have a small font size . The use of an ontology for querying domain knowledge was less popular than tags , but two aspects were particularly attractive to the participants : ( 1 ) the ability to see the entire 634 K Stock et al . © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd Transactions in GIS , 2013 , 17 ( 4 ) ontology in a structured way ; and ( 2 ) the ability to see linkages . While many alternatives to ontology querying have been proposed , including using the ontology as a back end , and explaining how queries were decomposed and mapped to databases ( for example , McGuinness et al . 2006 ) , participants still saw the direct use of ontologies as providing beneﬁts . However , these beneﬁts were clearly limited by the ontology visualization problems . Most existing examples of web - based visualization of ontologies , semantic networks and trees use only small ontologies . This project developed an ontology for part of a small sub - domain ( marine instruments , based around a subset of instruments ) , and as such is only a very small part of the ontology or ontologies that would be needed to describe the domain of interest more completely . In reality , domains cannot be neatly divided up , and many publications touch on a number of different domains ( for example , the publications explored often also related to generic concepts like ecology or topography ) . Thus potentially for this approach to work properly , very large ontologies would be required , and more effective tools for visualizing them , such as those mentioned in Section 3 . 2 . Most work to date addresses the problem of clutter and complexity of ontology visualiza - tion by either showing only a particular sub - tree of the ontology ( Katifori et al . 2007 ) , or by using some algorithm to remove some of the less - relevant nodes ( Xu et al . 2010 ) , potentially using cognitive approaches to such ﬁltering ( Falconer and Storey 2007 ) . There was some support in the current user study for this idea ( one participant said that he would “like to be able to get rid of the things you’re not interested in” , and another mentioned ﬁltering out ) , but there was more support for the beneﬁts of seeing everything as a whole ( including by those who also wanted to ﬁlter some items out ) . We therefore propose to address this apparently contradictory wish to see everything , including all the connections without the clutter , using a two - windowed visualization ( as suggested by the participants ) , showing an overview window of the entire ontology , and a detail window that can zoom in progressively . This does not rule out some of the visually appealing approaches reviewed by Katifori et al . ( 2007 ) , but does support the display of an ontology in its entirety , rather than in parts or with some nodes removed . The information provided by the ontology is much richer than that provided by the tags , in that it allows links to be followed . However , it is visually more difﬁcult to handle , particu - larly considering the absence of an ideal ontology visualization approach . It is likely that the beneﬁts of the ontologies would increase and the tags decrease as the number of concepts / terms became larger . As soon as the list of tags ﬁlls more than one screen , it becomes less useable , while well implemented ontology navigation could handle large amounts of informa - tion in a more convenient way . It is also unclear how important familiarity was in the evalua - tion . Participants were much more familiar with the use of tags than ontologies for querying , and it therefore likely that the results are biased against the latter . 7 . 2 Scientiﬁc Knowledge While the ability to query on some aspects of scientiﬁc knowledge ( methodology , technique ) was supported by participants , the ontology approach was rejected by participants . The scien - tiﬁc knowledge ontology itself assumes some understanding of the philosophy of science , which raises two problems . Firstly , users of the system may not have a good understanding of the philosophy of science , and secondly , the terminology used in the ontology may not reﬂect their terminology or way of thinking about the scientiﬁc process , which is often discipline - speciﬁc . Many participants said that they did not know what to search for and could not ﬁnd the term they entered . Therefore , any future development of this work would require a Finding Science with Science 635 © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd Transactions in GIS , 2013 , 17 ( 4 ) simpliﬁed version of the ontology , and would probably require some variations for particular domains . The other advantage of a simpliﬁed scientiﬁc knowledge ontology is that it makes automation of the identiﬁcation of scientiﬁc approaches , theories and methods from publica - tions more achievable , particularly since approaches to this kind of automation are becoming increasingly advanced ( for example , Noy et al . 2009 ) . The prototype included the ability to ask for recommendations ( once some results had been given ) on the basis of scientiﬁc knowledge . This allows users to ﬁnd other resources that use similar scientiﬁc approaches and removes the complexity from them , but it does not allow the same level of reﬁnement . For example , it is not possible to dictate a particular scientiﬁc methodology or technique . Given the popularity of the tagging approach and the beneﬁts that users saw in combining all of the different aspects of a resource ( for example , domain concept , parameter , location ) , and notwithstanding the scalability issues , the inclusion of scientiﬁc knowledge in the tags may prove a useful approach . This has a number of beneﬁts : • It reduces the signiﬁcant overhead required in annotating a resource with concepts from the scientiﬁc knowledge ontology . • It removes the constraint on the particular view of the scientiﬁc process reﬂected in the sci - entiﬁc knowledge ontology , as the creator chooses his or her own tags . • It avoids a problem that was encountered during creation of the ontologies in distinguish - ing between concepts that belonged to the domain ontology and concepts that belonged to the scientiﬁc knowledge ontology . In particular , the use of a marine instruments ontology resulted in some confusion about which ontology should contain some marine instruments , their methods , and the parameters they measured . 8 Conclusions The outcome of this work and the user study resulted in the following recommendations : 1 . Querying by informal tags is the preferred approach if there are few tags . 2 . Direct querying of a scientiﬁc knowledge ontology is not appropriate , but participants do want to search on scientiﬁc method . Inclusion of scientiﬁc knowledge as tags is proposed as an alternative to be explored . 3 . Display of the domain ontology using a two - windowed approach is proposed as a prefer - able approach to a single ontology window . This article has presented an approach to the discovery of scientiﬁc resources to support scientists in more advanced ways than currently popular discovery tools . This approach allows discovery on the basis of semantic information in the form of ontologies , and also on the basis of scientiﬁc knowledge and the process by which science is developed ( including scientiﬁc theo - ries , models and analysis methods ) , combined with tools for immediate access to scientiﬁc resources ( whether publications , datasets or web services ) that are of particular beneﬁt in the context of the geosciences . The approach also has the potential , in future work , to allow pat - terns in time and space to be discovered using the ontologies that describe the resources . A qualitative user study showed that participants were enthusiastic about the idea of such searching and recognized its power . Querying by tag was the most popular approach , followed by querying by domain ontology , allowing users the ability to get an overview of the entire domain conceptual content . Querying of the scientiﬁc knowledge ontology was less popular in 636 K Stock et al . © 2012 John Wiley & Sons Ltd Transactions in GIS , 2013 , 17 ( 4 ) part due to problems with visualization of the ontology and ﬁnding the terms of interest . However , participants did consider the ability to be able to specify searches based on scientiﬁc method and technique a powerful and appealing function . Nevertheless , future development of this approach would require a simpliﬁed scientiﬁc knowledge ontology to address lack of understanding and knowledge of the scientiﬁc process by the scientists themselves , cluttered and complex visualization of the scientiﬁc knowledge ontology and difﬁculties in annotating resources to describe the scientiﬁc approach .
