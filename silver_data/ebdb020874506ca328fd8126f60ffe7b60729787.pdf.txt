In budding yeast , the heterotetrameric MIND complex ( Mtw1 , Nnf1 , Nsl1 , Dsn1 ) , ortholog of the metazoan Mis12 complex , joins the centromere - proximal compo - nents , Mif2 and COMA , with the principal micro - tubule - binding component , the Ndc80 complex ( Ndc80C ) . We report the crystal structure of Kluy - veromyces lactis MIND and examine its partner interactions , to understand the connection from a centromeric nucleosome to a much larger microtu - bule . MIND resembles an elongated , asymmetric Y ; two globular heads project from a coiled - coil shaft . An N - terminal extension of Dsn1 from one head regulates interactions of the other head , blocking binding of Mif2 and COMA . Dsn1 phosphorylation by Ipl1 / Aurora B relieves this autoinhibition , enabling MIND to join an assembling kinetochore . A C - terminal extension of Dsn1 recruits Ndc80C to the opposite end of the shaft . The structure and properties of MIND show how it integrates phospho - regulatory in - puts for kinetochore assembly and disassembly . INTRODUCTION Kinetochores are multi - protein assemblies that attach eukary - otic chromosomes to spindle microtubules and mediate chro - mosome segregation in mitosis . Genomic stability depends on tight coordination of kinetochore assembly , orientation , spindle attachment , and disassembly with cell - cycle progression . In budding yeast , kinetochores assemble on ‘‘point’’ centro - meres and connect to a single spindle microtubule . Yeast centromeric DNA has a deﬁned sequence of approximately 150 bp , which speciﬁes kinetochore assembly by associating with a centromere - speciﬁc nucleosome core ( Biggins , 2013 ) . In metazoans , kinetochores assemble on ‘‘regional’’ centromeres of up to several megabases and establish attachments to multi - ple microtubules ( Przewloka and Glover , 2009 ; Verdaasdonk and Bloom , 2011 ) . Nonetheless , structural and functional conservation of kinetochore components shows that central elements of kinetochore architecture and mechanism are conserved across eukaryotic phyla ( Cheeseman and Desai , 2008 ; Joglekar et al . , 2008 , 2009 ; Santaguida and Musacchio , 2009 ) . Moreover , the copy number of kinetochore proteins in point and regional centromeres is proportional to the number of kinetochore - microtubule attachments , not to the length of centromeric DNA , suggesting that kinetochores of multi - cellular eukaryotes are effectively parallel repeats of the single kineto - chore - microtubule assembly found in budding yeast ( Joglekar et al . , 2009 ; Zinkowski et al . , 1991 ) . The conserved core of a kinetochore comprises approxi - mately 35 different protein species , most of them present in mul - tiple copies , giving a total assembly of more than 250 protein subunits , not including transiently attached regulatory compo - nents ( Biggins , 2013 ; De Wulf et al . , 2003 ; Joglekar et al . , 2006 ; Westermann et al . , 2003 ) . The core components form well - deﬁned subassemblies , usually classiﬁed as inner , centro - mere - associated , and outer , microtubule - associated protein complexes . Electron micrographs of kinetochores isolated from budding yeast show a dense , central hub , approximately 37 nm in diameter , surrounded by ﬁve to seven projecting mod - ules , believed to contain the proteins that contact taxol - stabi - lized microtubules ( Gonen et al . , 2012 ) . The heterotetrameric MIND complex of budding yeast , comprising Mtw1 , Nnf1 , Nsl1 , and Dsn1 , is essential for kineto - chore bi - orientation and proper chromosome segregation ( Cheeseman et al . , 2006 ; Hornung et al . , 2014 ; Kline et al . , 2006 ; Pagliuca et al . , 2009 ) . It is a conserved structural element that links inner - layer kinetochore components , Mif2 and COMA , with outer - layer components , Ndc80 complex ( Ndc80C ) and Spc105 ( Biggins , 2013 ; De Wulf et al . , 2003 ) . The MIND complex is thus the crucial bridge between chromatin - associated and microtubule - associated subassemblies and a central regulatory target . ‘‘Mis12 complex’’ ( Mis12C ) is the designation of its close homolog in ﬁssion yeast and metazoans . As seen by negative - stain electron microscopy ( EM ) , MIND / Mis12C is a 200 - A ˚ - long , rod - like structure with a globular region at one end ( Cho et al , 2011 ; Hornung et al . , 2011 , 2014 ; Maskell et al . , 2010 ; Petrovic et al . , 2010 , 2014 ; Screpanti et al . , 2011 ) . The narrower end binds the microtubule - associated Ndc80C and Spc105 ( Maskell et al . , 2010 ; Petrovic et al . , 2014 ) . Ndc80C , a 550 - A ˚ - long rod , deﬁnes the axis of a kinetochore . It 1014 Cell 167 , 1014 – 1027 , November 3 , 2016 ª 2016 Elsevier Inc . is a heterotetramer , with a globular module at each end of an a - helical , coiled - coil stalk . Subunits Ndc80 and Nuf2 form the larger , microtubule - binding globular end and most of the stalk ; Spc24 and Spc25 form the remainder of the stalk and the smaller , MIND - binding globular end ( Ciferri et al . , 2008 ; Wei et al . , 2005 , 2006 ) . Ndc80C also binds the ten - protein DASH / Dam1 complex , an essential , yeast - speciﬁc , outer kinetochore component crucial for microtubule attachment ( Cheeseman et al . , 2001 ; De Wulf et al . , 2009 ) . Ipl1 / Aurora B , a principal regulatory kinase for mitosis , promotes kinetochore stability , corrects microtubule attach - ment , and recruits spindle assembly checkpoint proteins . Lack of bi - orientation , and thus absence of tension between sister centromeres , leads to Ipl1 / Aurora B phosphorylation of Ndc80C and DASH / Dam1 , activation of the spindle checkpoint , and kinetochore - microtubule detachment and reattachment during anaphase delay ( Biggins and Murray , 2001 ; Cheeseman et al . , 2002 ; Krenn and Musacchio , 2015 ; Tien et al . , 2010 ; Stern and Murray , 2001 ) . Ipl1 / Aurora B is also required to assemble functional kinetochores . Phosphorylation of Dsn1 by Ipl1 / Aurora B promotes recruitment of MIND to centromeres and strengthens the association of inner - and outer - kinetochore components ( Akiyoshi et al . , 2013 ; Emanuele et al . , 2008 ; Kim and Yu , 2015 ; Yang et al . , 2008 ) . Two serines on Dsn1 , conserved in the human and S . cerevisiae proteins , are sites of Ipl1 / Aurora B phosphorylation ( Akiyoshi et al . , 2013 ; Welburn et al . , 2010 ; Yang et al . , 2008 ) . Regulation at these sites thus appears to be conserved , despite differences between yeast and metazoans in the timing of kinetochore reassembly and microtubule reattachment . We present here the X - ray crystal structure of the budding - yeast MIND complex . An accompanying paper ( Petrovic et al . , 2016 [ this issue of Cell ] ) describes the very similar structure of human Mis12C . They are heterotetrameric coiled - coil rods with two centromere - proximal globular domains . We map the binding of Mif2 and COMA subunit Ame1 to one globular head of MIND and show that an N - terminal segment of Dsn1 is an autoinhibi - tory regulator of these interactions . We present a model for relief of autoinhibition by Ipl1 / Aurora B phosphorylation of Dsn1 , allowing Mif2 and COMA to recruit MIND to kinetochores . We have also determined the structure of the C - terminal , microtu - bule - proximal tail of Dsn1 bound to the Spc24 / Spc25 subcom - plex of Ndc80C ; it occupies a conserved cleft previously shown to also bind Cnn1 ( Malvezzi et al . , 2013 ) . The structural data presented here enable us to propose a molecular model for the central kinetochore assembly in point - centromere yeast , ex - plaining the role of MIND in kinetochore organization and regula - tion through its association with Mif2 , COMA , and Ndc80C . RESULTS A Stable MIND Core Complex The yeast MIND complex is a heterotetramer , with one chain each of Mtw1 , Nnf1 , Nsl1 , and Dsn1 ( De Wulf et al . , 2003 ) . Stable subcomplexes of Mtw1 / Nnf1 and Dsn1 / Nsl1 can also be prepared as recombinant products ( Hornung et al . , 2011 ) . We expressed ( in bacteria ) and puriﬁed the K . lactis MIND heterote - tramer , which has less extensive regions of apparently unstruc - tured polypeptide chain than does its otherwise very similar S . cerevisiae ortholog ( 29 % – 44 % identity and 59 % – 77 % amino acid similarity for the four subunits ) . Secondary - structure predic - tion suggests the presence of extended coiled - coil regions in each of the four components ( Data S1 ) . We analyzed by mass spectrometry both trypsin - treated and spontaneously proteo - lyzed MIND complexes and found proteolytically sensitive seg - ments at the N and C termini of Dsn1 ( residues 1 – 229 and 480 – 491 ) and at the C terminus of Mtw1 ( residues 234 – 288 ) . We therefore made a truncated heterotetrameric MIND core , comprising Dsn1 ( 230 – 479 ) , Mtw1 ( 1 – 233 ) , and full - length Nsl1 ( 1 – 216 ) and Nnf1 ( 1 – 205 ) . We call this construct ‘‘MIND complex 1’’ ( MIND - C1 ) ( Figure S1 ) . Crystallization of MIND - C1 ultimately led to the structures described here . X - Ray Crystallographic Structure Determination MIND - C1 crystallized in four different space groups , but weak and anisotropic data required an iterative strategy for structure determination ( STAR Methods ; Figure S2 ; Table S1 ) . An initial low - resolution structure showed us how to prepare a heterodi - meric ‘‘MN complex 2’’ ( MN - C2 ) containing Mtw1 ( 1 – 120 ) and Nnf1 ( 1 – 102 ) . Crystals of MN - C2 yielded high - resolution data ( Table S2 ) and a structure that contributed to phase determina - tion for MIND - C1 . We traced residues Mtw1 1 – 233 , Nnf1 8 – 179 , 186 – 203 , Nsl1 5 – 150 , 167 – 216 , and Dsn1 253 – 310 , 354 – 405 , 419 – 479 and validated the amino acid sequence assignment by anomalous difference Fourier analysis ( Figure S2B ) ; loop 311 – 353 in Dsn1 is partially modeled as poly - alanine ( 311 – 343 , 349 – 353 ) . Some segments connecting a helices are in poor den - sity , and the chain trace in those regions is approximate . The beginning and end of each segment and a string of broken den - sity deﬁne the overall conﬁguration of the segment in question , and we have therefore kept the poorly deﬁned residues in the model . We list these segments in STAR Methods and provide details in Figure S3 . We reﬁned the ﬁnal MIND - C1 coordinates with data to minimum Bragg spacings of 3 . 2 , 4 . 1 , and 3 . 4 A˚ along a * , b * , and c * , respectively ( R free / R work = 36 . 4 / 32 . 5 % ) ( Table S1 ) . Molecular Structure of the MIND Complex MIND - C1 is an asymmetric ‘‘Y , ’’ with a coiled - coil rod and two globular modules , of which one ( ‘‘head II’’ ) caps one end of the rod and the other ( ‘‘head I’’ ) branches off about one - third of the way toward the other end ( Figure 1A ) . Its general outline thus agrees with published images from negative - stain EM . Head I contains N - proximal segments of Mtw1 and Nnf1 ; head II , N - proximal segments of Dsn1 and Nsl1 ( Figure 1A ) . These N - proximal segments are helical hairpins , with various local elaborations ; the two hairpins in each head pack onto each other to create four - helix bundles . Head I , which includes Mtw1 resi - dues 1 – 120 and Nnf1 residues 1 – 102 ( MN - C2 ) , has docking sites on its surface for peptidic segments of interacting partners , as we show later . Head II includes Dsn1 residues 253 – 303 and Nsl1 residues 1 – 90 ( Figure 1B ) . Dsn1 residues 230 – 252 , at the N terminus of the Dsn1 polypeptide chain in our crystals , are disordered . A long loop ( residues 303 – 363 ) at the C - terminal end of the Dsn1 helical hairpin projects away from the globular core and folds back along it , connecting into the coiled - coil rod . Although we can trace this loop in the electron density Cell 167 , 1014 – 1027 , November 3 , 2016 1015 A CC 3 CC 2 CC 1 J2 J1 B C Mtw1Nnf1 Nsl1Dsn1 90 210 Å head I head II Mtw1Nnf1 l1n1 head I head II Mtw1 1 233 288 head I 116 168 CC2 CC3 Nsl1 216 1 head II CC1 CC3 97 CC2 150 168 Dsn1 1 23 0 479 253 363 head II CC1 424 CC3 491 CC2 395 Nnf1 1 205 121 179 head I CC2 CC3 α 1 ’ α1 α2 α2’ α3 α4 α5 226 3 16 21 47 61 88 96 116 101 167 189 212 208 α1 α1’ α2 α2’ α3 α4 16 32 38 49 52 84 86 102 121 178 187 199 α4 α3 α2’ α2 α1 β1 β2 11 31 45 63 76 97 147 87 168 210 α4 α3 α2 α1 258 278 285 303 363 395 424 464 Figure 1 .

See also Figures S1 and S2 . 1016 Cell 167 , 1014 – 1027 , November 3 , 2016 map , most of its structure derives from contacts with neigh - boring molecules in the crystal lattice . The connection of the he - lical hairpin of Nsl1 with the coiled coil is through a short helix a 2 0 ( Figures 1A and 1C ) , which reinforces the core bundle of head II , and a short peptide that interacts with the C - terminal end of the Dsn1 loop . In the various crystal forms we have characterized , head II swivels 20 (cid:2) about the axis of the coiled coil , while the angle at which head I projects from the coiled - coil backbone of the complex appears to vary less . The two heterodimeric sub - complexes alternate in contrib - uting to the coiled coil that deﬁnes the axis of the MIND complex . The Dsn1 - Nsl1 coiled coil ( CC1 ) that emanates from head II ter - minates at the junction ( J1 ) from which head I projects ( Fig - ure 1A ) . A long , Mtw1 - Nnf1 coiled coil ( CC2 ) , roughly coaxial with CC1 , extends from this junction ; a continuation of the Nsl1 chain as a third coiled - coil element may help ensure this approx - imate coaxial orientation and further restrict any tendency to bend . Dsn1 continues as a partly disordered extended chain and then reinforces the Mtw1 - Nnf1 coiled coil toward the C - ter - minal end of CC2 . The third part of the rod ( CC3 ) has contri - butions from all four chains , creating a transition to a short coiled - coil segment that pairs Dsn1 and Mtw1 . The C - terminal peptides of these two chains are not part of the MIND - C1 construct ( Figure 1B ) ; as we show below , Dsn1 connects MIND with the Spc24 / Spc25 end of Ndc80C . We can consider all four chains in the MIND complex as ‘‘structural paralogs’’—related polypeptide - chain organization and similar three - dimensional conformation—because each has a helical hairpin near its N terminus linked to a long , segmented a - helical stem ( Figure 1C ) . The Dsn1 - Nsl1 and Mtw1 - Nnf1 pairs are also structural paralogs , and in the same sense , because of the interchain contacts within each heterodi - meric sub - complex . Comparison of structures in several crystal forms suggests that head I has a relatively ﬁxed orientation with respect to the rod axis , that head II can rotate by up to 20 (cid:2) about the coiled - coil axis , and that a hinge point of even larger range is between CC2 and CC3 ( Figure S6C ) . In crystals with a nanobody bound on head II , the axis of the rod bends by about 60 (cid:2) at the CC2 - CC3 junction . The bend must be imposed by packing in the crys - tal , as it is about 160 A˚ distant from the nanobody contact . Mif2 and Ame1 Interact with MIND Head I An N - terminal region of human CENP - C 1 – 71 and its S . cerevisiae ortholog Mif2 1 – 38 share a sequence motif sufﬁcient for high afﬁn - ity binding with the Mis12C / MIND complex ( Hornung et al . , 2014 ; Screpanti et al . , 2011 ) . We prepared Mtw1 1 – 120 / Nnf1 1 – 102 and Dsn1 230 – 397 / Nsl1 1 – 118 and showed by size - exclusion chroma - tography that K . lactis Mif2 1 – 41 co - elutes with the former but not with the latter ( Figure 2A ) . We puriﬁed the resulting complex , crystallized it , and determined the structure at 2 . 9 - A˚ resolution by molecular replacement with MN - C2 as the search model ( Figure 2B ; Table S2 ) . We could build Mif2 residues 5 – 36 into continuous density . The peptide wraps around the domain , with residues 5 – 15 contacting Mtw1 a 1 , a 2 , and residues 28 – 36 contacting Mtw1 a 2 and Nnf1 a 1 ( Figure 2B ) . The Mif2 resi - dues in these interfaces are conserved in all budding yeast ( Fig - ure 2C ) . Those in the C - terminal part of the peptide are also conserved in metazoans , as are the contacting residues in Mtw1 and Nnf1 ( Data S1 ) . The accompanying paper shows that the interaction of the human Mis12C with CENP - C resem - bles the one shown here , particularly for Mif2 residues 28 – 36 and CENP - C residues 35 – 43 ( Petrovic et al . , 2016 ) . The heterotetrameric COMA ( Ctf19 , Okp1 , Mcm21 , Ame1 ) complex associates tightly with MIND ( Hornung et al . , 2014 ) . The Ame1 - Okp1 heterodimeric sub - complex is essential for MIND recruitment to kinetochores and for viability in budding yeast ( Hornung et al . , 2014 ) . Negative - stain electron microscopy and binding experiments suggest that Ame1 - Okp1 interacts with the Mtw1 - Nnf1 globular domain ( head I ) , through a conserved , 15 - residue N - terminal motif ( Hornung et al . , 2014 ) . In experiments analogous to those in the preceding section , we showed that this N - terminal Ame1 peptide indeed associates with head I . Mapping of conserved residues in an alignment of Mtw1 1 – 120 / Nnf1 1 – 102 sequences from ten fungal species onto the structure of MN - C2 yields three discrete surface patches ( Figure 3A ; Data S1 ) . One of these ( site I ) is the Mif2 binding site . Mif2 and COMA do not compete for interaction with MIND ( Hornung et al . , 2014 ) . We can therefore eliminate any substantial part of site I as an Ame1 contact . After conﬁrming by a size - exclusion experiment that Ame1 ( 1 – 24 ) indeed binds Mtw1 1 – 120 / Nnf1 1 – 102 , we tested a panel of head I constructs mutated in sites II and III , to deter - mine the likely interaction surface . The experiments in Figure 3B show that site II is necessary for COMA binding with MIND . Dsn1 Interaction with Spc24 / Spc25 Deletion of 28 residues at the C terminus of S . cerevisiae Dsn1 perturbs binding to the Spc24 / Spc25 components of Ndc80C and generates a lethal phenotype in yeast ( Malvezzi et al . , 2013 ) . A related segment from Cnn1 also binds Spc24 / Spc25 , and we expect from the structure of that complex that neither the Cnn1 nor the Dsn1 segment will be tightly folded in the absence of its target ( Malvezzi et al . , 2013 ; Schleiffer et al . , 2012 ) . Our limited proteolysis experiments indeed led us to delete the C - terminal residues ( 480 – 491 ) of K . lactis Dsn1 when designing MIND - C1 . Moreover , deletion of these residues without truncating Mtw1 made the Mtw1 C terminus very prote - ase sensitive , with aggregation of the residual MIND , so our design for MIND - C1 had a 55 - residue C - terminal deletion in Mtw1 as well as the 12 - residue C - terminal deletion in Dsn1 ( Figure 1B ) . The MIND - C1 structure shows close approach of the trimmed C termini of Dsn1 and Mtw1 . We therefore tested whether the C - terminal region of Mtw1 contributes , either directly or indirectly , to the interaction of Dsn1 with the Ndc80 complex . We synthesized S . cerevisiae Dsn1 560 – 576 and two conserved peptides from the C terminus of Mtw1 ( Mtw1 230 – 262 and Mtw1 274 – 289 ) and labeled them with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) for ﬂuorescence polarization binding assays . Spc24 / Spc25 bound Dsn1 560 – 576 with K D (cid:3) 12 m M ; Mtw1 230 – 262 and Mtw1 274 – 289 did not bind ( Figure 4A ) . We tested whether addition of either of the Mtw1 peptides would increase the afﬁnity of Dsn1 560 – 576 for Spc24 / Spc25 but did not detect a measurable change ( data not shown ) . Thus , Dsn1 560 – 576 is necessary and sufﬁcient for binding Spc24 / Spc25 . Cell 167 , 1014 – 1027 , November 3 , 2016 1017 Structure of Spc24 / Spc25 Bound with the C - Terminal Segment of Dsn1 Dsn1 and Cnn1 compete for binding with Spc24 / Spc25 ( Schleiffer et al . , 2012 ) . Cnn1 60 – 84 binds by insertion of a short a helix into a hydrophobic cleft on the Spc24 / Spc25 heterodimer ( Malvezzi et al . , 2013 ) . Mps1 - dependent phos - phorylation of Ser74 on Cnn1 regulates the association . We crys - tallized S . cerevisiae Spc24 155 – 213 / Spc25 132 – 221 with bound Dsn1 560 – 572 and determined the structure at a resolution of 1 . 8 A ˚ ( Table S2 ) . An a helix , Dsn1 residues 560 – 571 , lies in the cleft previously identiﬁed from the Cnn1 structure , with conserved Dsn1 serine residues ( S567 and S569 ) at the interface ( Figures 4B and 4C ) . We further showed that a peptide with both these serines mutated to aspartic acid , Dsn1 560 – 576 : S2D failed to bind Spc24 / Spc25 , consistent with previous data showing that phosphorylation of Cnn1 blocks its interaction with Spc24 / Spc25 ( Figure 4A ) ( Malvezzi et al . , 2013 ) . Dsn1 N - Terminal Arm Interacts with MIND Head I Ipl1 / Aurora B regulates the interaction of CENP - C / Mif2 with Mis12C / MIND by phosphorylating two conserved serine resi - dues on Dsn1 ( S100 and S109 in humans , S240 and S250 in S . cerevisiae ) ( Akiyoshi et al . , 2013 ; Yang et al . , 2008 ) . In human cells that express phospho - mimetic Dsn1 S100E , S109E or that have a deletion in Dsn1 of residues 92 – 113 , CENP - C binds more tightly with Mis12C than it does in wild - type controls ( Kim and Yu , 2015 ) .

These data suggest that phosphorylation displaces the Dsn1 segment bearing the serines from an autoin - hibitory site elsewhere on MIND , opening up the complex for recruitment by CENP - C / Mif2 . We could not examine this potential mechanism directly in the MIND - C1 structure , because our crystals of K . lactis MIND - C1 lack Dsn1 residues 1 – 229 and because electron den - sity of the N terminus of the truncated protein is uninterpretable from Q230 to S252 ( Figure 1 ; Data S1 ) . Nonetheless , the struc - ture of the complex , inspection of crystal contacts , and oligo - merization properties of various constructs prompted us to determine whether Dsn1 205 – 255 binds the globular , head I domain of Mtw1 / Nnf1 . We created three head II constructs containing different portions of the Dsn1 N - terminal region : head II D205 contains Dsn 205 – 313 / Nsl1 1 – 83 ; head II D230 contains Dsn1 230 – 313 / Nsl1 1 – 83 ; and head II D256 contains Dsn1 256 – 313 / Nsl1 11 – 83 ( Figure S1 for MIND constructs ) . We systematically tested each head II construct by size exclusion chromatography for binding with head I ( Mtw1 1 – 102 / Nnf1 1 – 120 ) ( Figure 5 ) . Head II D256 did not bind head I ( Figure 5A ) , but head II D230 and head II D205 both bound strongly enough for co - elution ( Figures 5B and 5C ) . Only the latter bound MIND - C1 , however ( Figure 5E ) . We interpret these results to indicate that intramolecular binding of the Dsn1 N - ter - minal segment ( residues 230 – 255 ) present in MIND - C1 masks the site for association of an exogenous Dsn1 230 – 255 peptide ( here supplied on head II D230 ) , but that it does not mask addi - A B Figure 3 .

( It is likely that binding of head II D205 also displaces the partial intramolecular inhibition from residues 230 – 255 , but our experiments are insensitive to that possibility . ) We take these data as direct evidence for intramolecular interaction between the N - terminal arm of Dsn1 and head I . Why is the intramolecular interaction of Dsn1 residues 230 – 255 with head I not present in our crystals ? Our best ordered crystals grew from an optimized mother liquor that included 0 . 2 M KSCN and 0 . 2 M KBr—i . e . , from mildly chaot - ropic conditions , presumably required to avoid aggregation and poor crystal growth ( Table S3 ) . An occasional inter molecular association through the Dsn1 N - terminal arm , at the high protein concentration used for crystallization , could account for aggre - gation . We have shown that in 0 . 2 M KSCN , 0 . 2 M KBr , head II D230 does not bind head I ( Figure S4 ) . That is , the conditions needed for well - ordered crystals precluded formation of the contact . Evidence that Dsn1 Phosphorylation Relieves Autoinhibition We tested whether phosphorylation of S213 and S223 might affect the Dsn1 interaction with head I and found that phos - pho - mimetic version of head II D205 ( designated head II D205 - 2D ) , with aspartic acid instead of serine at positions 213 and 223 , failed to bind MIND - C1 . The phospho - mimetic substitutions evidently weakened or eliminated any binding from the ﬁrst part of the arm ( residues 205 – 230 ) , and internal competition from Dsn1 residues 230 – 255 presumably blocked interaction with the second part ( Figure 5F ) . These observations support our inference that the consequence of Ipl1 / Aurora B phosphory - lation of serines 213 and 223 is to relieve autoinhibition—specif - ically by dissociating the N - terminal extension of head II from the surface of head I , allowing CENP - C / Mif2 to bind instead . We also tested directly , whether Mif2 and the arm of Dsn1 compete , using bacterially expressed K . lactis Mif2 , MIND - C1 Cell 167 , 1014 – 1027 , November 3 , 2016 1019 and head II D205 . Mif2 bound stably to MIND - C1 as shown by a shift in the peak elution volume in analytical size exclusion chromatography ( Figure 6A ) . A mixture of Mif2 , MIND - C1 and head II D205 gave two distinct elution peaks : peak 1 ( fractions 2 – 5 ) containing Mif2 bound to MIND - C1 and peak 2 ( fractions 8 – 10 ) containing MIND - C1 bound to head II D205 ( Figure 6A ) . The two ligands are thus mutually exclusive in their association with MIND - C1 . We further investigated this competition by measuring the afﬁnity of synthesized FITC - Mif2 1 – 41 with different MIND complexes in a ﬂuorescence polarization experiment . The afﬁnity of Mif2 1 – 41 for MIND - C1 : D205 was negligible when compared with a K D of 1 . 8 m M for the phospho - mimetic MIND - C1 : D205 : S2D ( Figures 6B and 6C ) . Furthermore , deleting the Dsn1 arm ( residues 205 – 229 ) led to a 10 - fold increase in the afﬁnity of Mif2 for MIND - C1 ( K D (cid:3) 0 . 17 m M ) . These measure - ments are consistent with the Dsn1 autoinhibition mechanism proposed above . Dsn1 and Ame1 Compete for Binding Mtw1 / Nnf1 Head I Ame1 1 – 24 and Mif2 1 – 41 both bind head I . The results of the previ - ous section show that the Mif2 site overlaps the site for associ - ation of the Dsn1 segment comprising residues 205 – 230 . One model for autoinhibition is that part of the Dsn1 arm ( residues 205 – 229 ) competes with Mif2 for one site on head I and part of the arm ( residues 230 – 255 ) competes with Ame1 for another site . The results in Figure S4B ( panels 4 and 5 ) are consistent with this simple picture ; they show that head II D230 , which con - tains only one part of the Dsn1 arm , binds with wild - type head I but not with head I Site II mut , which bears mutations that like - wise prevent Ame1 from binding ( Figure S4B ) . We also examined the effect of the Ame1 1 – 24 peptide on the association of head I with head II D205 . Panels 1 and 2 of Fig - ure S4C show that head I and head II D205 associated with 1 : 1 stoichiometry , even when the latter had the two phospho - mimetic mutations ( II D205 - S2D ) . Addition of Ame1 peptide to these complexes interfered with their heterodimeric association . Fig - ure S4C , panels 3 and 4 , shows that His 6 - GST - Ame1 ( 1 – 24 ) shifted more of head I ( Mtw1 1 – 120 / Nnf1 1 – 102 ) into fractions 2 and 3 than it did of head II D205 ( Dsn1 205 – 313 / Nsl1 1 – 83 ) . The phos - pho - mimetic mutant of head II , which associates less strongly with head I than does wild - type , was essentially absent from fraction 2 and only weakly present in fraction 3 . Using ﬂuores - cence polarization experiments , we also measured the afﬁnity of Ame1 1 – 25 for different MIND constructs . Like Mif2 , Ame1 bound strongly to MIND - C1 ( K D (cid:3) 0 . 26 m M ) and to the phos - pho - mimetic MIND - C : D205 - 2D ( K D (cid:3) 1 . 5 m M ) , but did not associate with wild - type MIND - C1 : D205 , which includes the un - modiﬁed Dsn1 arm ( residues 205 – 255 ) ( Figures 6B and 6C ) . We conclude that not only do Ame1 and Dsn1 interact with a com - mon site on head I but that Ame1 can exclude Dsn1 230 – 255 in the absence of the additional Dsn1 : head I contacts made by the 205 – 229 part of the Dsn1 arm—i . e . , the contacts eliminated by phosphorylation of Ser213 and Ser223 . Thus , the same Ipl1 phosphorylation event can in principle stimulate recruitment and stronger binding of MIND by both Mif2 and COMA . DISCUSSION Kinetochores of point - centromere yeast expand by about 5 - fold , both in dimension and in molecular multiplicity , in bridging a single , centromeric nucleosome with a single , kinetochore microtubule . The dimensional expansion is from (cid:3) 100 A˚ for the nucleosome to (cid:3) 500 A˚ for the Ndc80C - DASH / Dam1 ‘‘corona’’ surrounding an end - on linked microtubule ; the molecular multi - plicity expansion is from two , for Cse4 and Mif2 , to eight to ten for Ndc80C and a still larger number for DASH / Dam1 ring ( Jogle - kar et al . , 2006 ) . The MIND complex links these two levels , con - necting Cse4 and Mif2 , bound at its globular end , with Ndc80C , bound by its narrow end . The molecular structure of MIND and the characteristics of its contacts with partner proteins together suggest how it can expand the kinetochore and show how it integrates phospho - regulatory inputs for both assembly and B Dsn1 ( 560 - 571 ) Spc24 ( 155 - 213 ) Spc25 ( 132 - 221 ) 40 90 C K . lactis / 476 - 491 K . waltii / 524 - 539 S . kluyveri / 523 - 538 A . gossypii / 500 - 515 C . glabrata / 447 - 461 S . pombe / 307 - 322 H . sapiens / 331 - 346 M . musculus / 331 - 346 G . gallus / 332 - 347 S . cerevisiae / 557 - 571 Ser 567 Leu 563 Phe 570 Leu 566 Leu 562 Ser 569 Ser 567 Phe 570 Leu 562 Ser 569 A • • 0 10 20 30 40 50 0 50 100 150 200 P o l a r i z a t i o n ( m P ) Mtw1 ( 230 - 262 ) K D = n . b .

Its dimensions and apparent oligomerization prop - erties ﬁt a hub - and - spokes model for EM images of negatively stained , isolated yeast kinetochores ( Gonen et al . , 2012 ) . Mechanism of Phospho - Dsn1 Promoted Kinetochore Assembly The N - terminal segment of Dsn1 ( residues 1 – 255 , of which only residues 230 – 255 are present in our crystals ) , probably unstruc - tured , projects from head II . Inner - kinetochore components Mif2 and Ame1 bind noncompetitively to head I at adjacent , but distinct interfaces ( Figures 2 and 3 ) . Both interactions are through ﬂexible peptide segments at termini of the respective proteins , minimizing steric exclusion and allowing two relatively large proteins to contact a single , small domain on MIND . The positions of the two heads of MIND and the relatively ﬂexible connection between head II and the coiled - coil stalk enable the extended , N - terminal arm of Dsn1 to associate with head I . Amino acid residues in Dsn1 between positions 205 and 255 bind head I and block the sites for Mif2 and Ame1 ( Figure 6D ) . Phosphorylation of serine residues within this region ( Ser213 and Ser223 , known targets for the Ipl1 / Aurora B protein kinase ) eliminates the contact and exposes the sites , so that Mif2 and Ame1 can associate instead . Dsn1 residues between 205 and 230 contact the Mif2 site ; residues between 230 and 255 , the Ame1 site . Although serines 213 and 223 are both in the former segment , Ame1 binds tightly enough to displace Dsn1 230 – 255 , unless the arm is also ‘‘clamped down’’ by binding of 205 – 230 to the Mif2 site . Differential afﬁnities , the highly effective con - centration of a locally attached ligand , and Dsn1 phosphoryla - tion are thus components of a MIND - based , regulatory switch in kinetochore assembly . Signiﬁcance of Small Interfaces and Flexible Linkers for Efﬁcient Kinetochore Assembly and Disassembly MIND binds its partners , Mif2 , Ame1 , and Spc24 / Spc25 , through 33 - , 23 - , and 12 - residue peptides that project from the ends of even longer , unstructured , ﬂexible linkers , of between 12 and 200 amino acid residues . The characteristics of these linkers facilitate efﬁcient capture and localization of other kinetochore components . Moreover , the positions of these linkers on the rod reﬂect a likely order of kinetochore assembly . The linkers from Mif2 and Ame1 recruit MIND through contacts at its glob - ular end ; a linker from the opposite end of MIND recruits Ndc80C . Thus , each extended linker is distal to the interface established by the preceding step . Interfaces of folded , globular domains with short peptides have several advantages for regulated assembly and disas - sembly . ( 1 ) As noted above for Mif2 and Ame1 , one small , glob - ular domain can bind two ( or more ) , much larger partner proteins or protein complexes , if the contacts are with peptide segments that extend away from the bulky , folded domains of the partners . ( 2 ) Peptides are much better substrates for modiﬁcation than are surfaces of folded domains . For example , full activity of a protein kinase requires that several residues adjacent to the residue to be modiﬁed ﬁt into speciﬁcity pockets on the surface of the enzyme . A residue on an unfolded peptide is clearly a more avail - able substrate than one on a stably folded , domain surface . Similar arguments apply to other post - translational modiﬁca - tions . ( 3 ) Even a tightly bound ligand will dissociate ( and reasso - ciate ) many times during the course of a cell cycle . Thus , even an assembled interface can be subject to modiﬁcation by a suitably localized enzyme . The interfaces between Mif2 and Mtw1 / Nnf1 , Ame1 and Mtw1 / Nnf1 , and Dsn1 and Spc24 / Spc25 all have conserved serine and threonine residues , and phospho - regu - lated disruption of kinetochore interfaces at conserved , modi - ﬁable residues ( e . g . , serines 567 and 569 in the C - terminal segment of S . cerevisiae Dsn1 , leading to loss of contact with Spc24 / Spc25 ) is a potential mechanism for disassembling a kinetochore . Cell - cycle - dependent activation or recruitment of the relevant kinase can provide the required temporal control . ( 4 ) Flexible connections between more rigid structural members allows an assembly to adapt in shape to distinct functional demands and to respond to external force without rupturing . In the case of a yeast kinetochore , for example , side - on and end - on attachment to microtubules have very different geomet - ric requirements . The compliance of such interactions , both in extension ( if the interacting segment is part of a longer , ﬂexible linker ) and direction , may be relevant when a kinetochore is under tension in metaphase and anaphase . Model of the Core Kinetochore Complex A yeast kinetochore connects an (cid:3) 150 - bp centromere , marked by a centromeric nucleosome , with a single microtubule . The progressive expansion in scale from inner to outer kinetochore is both in dimension and in stoichiometry , and MIND appears to be a critical spatial and stoichiometric adaptor ( Figure 7A ) . Quantitative ﬂuorescence microscopy suggests that a yeast centromeric nucleosome recruits one Mif2 dimer ( perhaps clamped across its dyad ) and that the attached microtubule has approximately eight Ndc80 complexes ( Joglekar et al . , 2006 ) . The estimates for COMA and MIND are two to three and six to seven , respectively . Electron micrographs of negatively stained kinetochore particles isolated from yeast cells show a hub with ﬁve to seven projections , about 400 A˚ long ( Gonen et al . , 2012 ) . Although the microscopy did not allow assignment of molecular identity , our results suggest that interactions of the MIND complex could determine the observed organization of these particles .

Cell 167 , 1014 – 1027 , November 3 , 2016 1023 molecular ratios are correct , what we know about the various components makes MIND the only plausible candidate . Taking these data into account , we propose a model for kinetochore as - sembly in which oligomeric clustering of MIND creates a core that recruits outer - kinetochore components and deﬁnes their copy number ( Figure 7B ) . We have reported here various observations supporting the notion that MIND can oligomerize even in the absence of COMA or Mif2 . In each of the four crystal forms we have examined , we ﬁnd the same crystallographic packing interface between heads I and II of neighboring MIND - C1 mol - ecules ( Figures S5 and S6A ) .

Kinetochore Model ( A ) Schematic cross - section through a point - centromere kinetochore , illustrating the dimensional expansion from a centromeric nucleosome ( bottom ) to a microtubule ( top ) . Various conserved molecular complexes are labeled and color coded . MIND occupies a central position in the hierarchy extending from nucleosome to Ndc80C / DASH . ( B ) Surface rendering of a 3D view similar to the cross - section in ( A ) , but omitting the nucleosome - proximal components . The choice of a 6 - fold structure is arbitrary—EM images appear to show ﬁve , six , and seven ( Gonen et al . , 2012 ) . We have used head I - head II interactions seen in all our crystal forms to construct this model ; most of its features do not depend on assuming that those particular contacts are present . ( C ) Comparison of kinetochoremodel withexperimentaldata . EM images adapted from Macmillan Publisher Ltd : [ Nature Structural & MolecularBiology ] ( Gonen et al . , 2012 ) , copyright ( 2012 ) . End - on view of the surface rendering , with nucleosome - proximal components omitted along with the microtubule and DASH , shows proposed head I to head II interactions that generate the central core . Perspective view on the right includes DASH and the microtubule from ( B ) . See also Figures S5 and S6 . 1024 Cell 167 , 1014 – 1027 , November 3 , 2016 predominantly monomeric at low concentration in solution , at concentrations greater than about 10 mg / mL , we detect formation of a discrete dimer ( Figure S6B ) . The contact be - tween complexes is evidently not sufﬁcient to create a larger , long - lived oligomer , but further contributions from COMA , Mif2 , or post - translational modiﬁcation could reinforce the interaction we have detected . We can model 5 - , 6 - , and 7 - fold rings of MIND complexes , with contacts between heads of adjacent complexes that closely resemble the conserved interface in our crystals ( Figures 7 and S6D ) . Inter - action of two of the MIND complexes in the ring with the N termini of the two chains in the nucleosome - bound Mif2 dimer will stabilize a ring - like MIND oligomer , as will the con - tacts with Ame1 , since COMA also binds Mif2 ( Hornung et al . , 2014 ) . The structure of the MIND complex also suggests an inter - pretation of published images from negative - stain EM of iso - lated kinetochores ( Gonen et al . , 2012 ) ( Figure 7C ) . The size of the hub - and - spokes assembly in these images is consistent with the diameter expected for a radially displayed MIND structure ( Figures 7C and S6D ) . The inner - kinetochore compo - nents CBF3 , Cse4 nucleosome , COMA , and Mif2 would contribute further to the density at the center of the particles seen in the micrographs ( Gonen et al . , 2012 ) . The organization of these isolated kinetochore assemblies does not depend on microtubules or DASH / Dam1 , as neither are present in the preparation ( Gonen et al . , 2012 ) . Our molecular interpretation of the micrographs is compatible with the head - head contacts and MIND oligomerization proposed in the preceding paragraph and chosen in constructing Figure 7B ; small adjustments in the contacts and observed ﬂexibility in the connection between head II , and CC1 could accommodate the observed variation in number of spokes . The same molecular picture is equally compatible , however , with any other set of interactions that clusters the heads , provided that it generates a hub - and - spokes assembly having the observed dimensions . The model in Figure 7 illustrates that the structure of a kinet - ochore has both the regulatory properties derived from ﬂexible peptide links to relatively small interfaces and the tensile strength required to resist the forces exerted by microtubule depolymerization . Although any one interface would not with - stand the force needed to move a chromosome , a series of parallel interfaces can readily do so . Further reinforcement , for speciﬁcity as well as stability , comes from crosslinking through interactions of COMA with both MIND and Mif2 . The open framework , generated by the long , coiled - coil rods that are common features of both Ndc80C and MIND , is necessary to allow rapid escape of dissociating tubulin heterodimers , while the ﬂexibility of the hinge - like linkages between subcomplexes ( Mif2 to MIND , MIND to Ndc80C , COMA to MIND , and pre - sumably similar connections with additional kinetochore com - ponents ) imparts compliance in response to both lateral and longitudinal forces . The structure and interactions of MIND are thus appropriate for its function as the adaptor between a centromere anchoring subassembly and a microtubule - contacting framework that can track during depolymerization .

Harrison ( harrison @ crystal . harvard . edu ) . EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS Expression plasmids contained cDNA sequences from Kluyveromyces lactis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Recombinant proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta2 pLysS cells ( Novagen ) in 2xYT broth ( Yeast Extract Tryptone from Research Prod - ucts International ) or M9 , minimal salts media ( Sigma ) for selenomethionine - derivatized proteins . Cells were grown at 37 (cid:2) C at 220 rpm in 2 L shaking ﬂasks until A 600 reached 0 . 6 then immediately induced by addition of isopropyl b - D - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG from GoldBio ) to a ﬁnal concentration of 0 . 25 – 0 . 5 mM . After induction , cells were grown for 16 – 18 hr at 18 (cid:2) C . METHOD DETAILS Protein Expression and Puriﬁcation Production of MIND Complex Components Kluyveromyces lactis ( K . lactis ) genes for Mtw1 , Nnf1 , Nsl1 and Dsn1 proteins were cloned by PCR ampliﬁcation from genomic DNA into a pET3aTR vector modiﬁed for ligation - independent cloning ( LIC ) ( Schmitzberger and Harrison , 2012 ; Tasto et al . , 2001 ) . All con - structs were designed for poly - cistronic co - expression as heterotetramer or heterodimer with a tobacco etch virus ( TEV ) protease cleavable hexahistidine ( His 6 ) - tag at the N terminus of each protein in the following order : Dsn1 , Mtw1 , Nnf1 and Nsl1 for MIND - C1 and Mtw1 , Nnf1 and Dsn1 , Nsl1 for head I and head II constructs ( see Figure S1 for full list of constructs ) . All MIND constructs were overexpressed in Escherichia coli ( E . coli ) Rosetta2 pLysS cells ( Novagen ) as described above and harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm in a J6 - MI centrifuge for 30 min ( Beckman Coulter ) . Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer made of 50 mM HEPES ( 4 - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) - 1 - piperazineethanesulfonic acid ) , pH 7 . 5 , 600 mM NaCl , 10 mM imidazole , 1 mM tris ( 2 - carboxyethyl ) - phosphine ( TCEP ) , 10 % glycerol , supplemented with protease inhibitors ( 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl ﬂuoride , 2 m g / ml aprotinin , 1 m g / ml leu - peptin , 1 m g / ml pepstatin , all from Roche ) .

The sample was immobilized on Co 2 + resin ( TALON Metal Afﬁnity Resin , Clontech ) and incubated for 1 hr at 4 (cid:2) C while rotating . The immobilized protein was washed with 15 bed volumes of buffer containing 50 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 5 , 600 mM NaCl , 10 mM imidazole , 1 mM TCEP , 10 % glycerol , and eluted in 50 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 5 , 50 mM NaCl , 400 mM imidazole , 1 mM TCEP , 10 % glycerol . Protein samples were immediately loaded on HiTrap Q HP ( GE Healthcare ) anion exchange column followed by size exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) on a preparative Superdex - S200 HiLoad 16 / 60 column ( GE Healthcare ) . All proteins were concentrated with Amicon Ultra centrifugal ﬁlters ( Millipore ) and immediately used for crystallization trials or frozen and kept at (cid:4) 80 (cid:2) C for biochemical experiments . All MIND constructs , except head I ( Mtw1 1 - 120 / Nnf1 1 - 102 ) were stored in SEC buffer from the ﬁnal Superdex 200 run including : 30 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM TCEP and 50 mM CHES , pH 9 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM TCEP for head I ( Mtw1 1 - 120 / Nnf1 1 - 102 ) . Production of Mif2 and Ame1 K . lactis full - length Mif2 and Mif2 1 - 41 peptide were cloned with a cleavable TEV protease site after the N - terminal His 6 - maltose bind - ing protein ( MBP ) - tag , expressed and puriﬁed as described above . Full - length Mif2 was used without removing the His 6 - MBP - tag in 30 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM TCEP . The elution fractions from Superdex 200 of His 6 - MBP - Mif2 1 - 41 were combined and concentrated to less than 2 mL using Amicon Ultra 10K centrifugal ﬁlters and incubated with TEV while rotating overnight at 4 (cid:2) C . After cleaving the tag , the sample was processed with an Amicon Ultra 10K centrifugal ﬁlter , separating the His 6 - MBP - tag and TEV protease as retentate from the Mif2 1 - 41 peptide as ﬁltrate . The Mif2 1 - 41 peptide was added to different MIND constructs and concen - trated together to test binding and for crystallization experiments with Mtw1 1 - 120 / Nnf1 1 - 102 . K . lactis Ame1 1 - 24 was cloned into a single expression LIC vector with an N - terminal His 6 - glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) - tag as described above . His 6 - GST - Ame1 1 - 24 peptide was puriﬁed the same way as the MIND constructs , stored and used for binding experiments in 50 mM CHES , pH 9 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM TCEP . Production of Spc24 / Spc25 and Dsn1 560 - 572 The coding region for Spc24 and Spc25 were ampliﬁed by PCR from isolated S . cerevisiae genomic DNA and cloned into a pET3aTR vector encoding an N - terminal His 6 - tag with TEV protease cleavage site added to Spc25 . The heterodimer Spc24 ( residues 155 – 213 ) / Spc25 ( residues132 – 221 ) was recombinantly expressed and puriﬁed following a protocol similar to the one described above for the production of MIND constructs . After the Co 2 + - resin afﬁnity puriﬁcation step , TEV protease was added to the eluted sample to cleave the His 6 - tag and the product was passed again over Co 2 + - resin to clear sample of free His 6 - tag and His 6 - TEV protease . Spc24 155 - 213 / Spc25 132 - 221 was concentrated and loaded on gel ﬁltration Superdex - S200 HiLoad 16 / 60 column ( GE Health - care ) equilibrated in gel ﬁltration ( GF ) buffer ( 20 mM bis - tris propane , pH 7 . 6 , 300 mM NaCl , 5 mM dithiothreitol ) . The S . cerevisiae Dsn1 peptide fragment ( residues 560 – 572 : QQLLKGLSLSFSK ) was produced by Tufts University Core Facility ( Boston , MA ) , and resuspended in GF buffer . Generation of Nanobodies NanobodiesagainsttheMIND - C1complexwereraisedinalpacasaccordingtoestablishedprotocolsinthelaboratoryofHiddePloeghat the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research . Brieﬂy , recombinantly produced MIND - C1 was injected into an alpaca at 2 mg / mL to elicit an immune response . After two rounds of immunization , total RNA was isolated and used to synthesize the variable fragments of heavy chain antibodies . Nanobodies were selected for binding MIND - C1 by phage display as described in detail in ( Li et al . , 2016 ) . Production and Screening of Nanobodies Eight nanobodies with a C - terminal His 6 - tag were recombinantly expressed in Rosetta2 pLysS cells as described above . Cells were harvested following the protocol for MIND complexes described above . Puriﬁcation of the nanobodies included gravity ﬂow Co 2 + - afﬁnity column , concentration of the sample eluted in 30 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 5 , 200 mM NaCl and 400 mM imidazole , followed by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex - S200 HiLoad 16 / 60 column in buffer containing 30 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA . To test binding , each nanobody ( at 20 m M concentration ) was incubated for 30 min with MIND - C1 ( at 2 m M ) and loaded on an analytical Superdex - S200 Increase 10 / 300 GL column ( GE Healthcare ) . One of the eight nanobodies tested formed a complex with MIND - C1 that was stable throughout the chromatography run and was used for crystallization trials . Limited Proteolysis and Mass Spectrometry To identify a stableMIND heterotetramersuitable forcrystallizationtrials , weperformed limited proteolysis with trypsin usingfull - length recombinantlyproduced K . lactis MINDcontainingMtw1 , Nnf1 , Nsl1andDsn1 .

Trypsindigestionwasstoppedby adding crystalline powder of guanidine hydrochloride ( Sigma ) until saturation and submitted for ion trap mass spectrometry analysis at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Mass Spectrometry Laboratory at University of California , Berkeley . The most stable MIND - C1 complex had two Dsn1 deletions ( residues 1 - 229 and 480 - 491 ) and a Mtw1 C - terminal deletion ( residues 234 - 288 ) . Protein Crystallization and Data Collection All crystals of MIND - C1 , MIND - C1 - nanobody , MN - C2 , MN - C2 - Mif2 1 - 41 and Spc24 / Spc25 - Dsn1 560 - 572 were grown in 48 well plates at 18 (cid:2) C by hanging - drop vapor diffusion with 200 m L reservoir solution and a drop of 1 – 2 m L each , protein and reservoir solution at different ratios . Details of protein concentration , sample buffer , crystallization condition and cryo - protection solution for each of the crystallized complexes are provided in Table S3 . e3 Cell 167 , 1014 – 1027 . e1 – e6 , November 3 , 2016 All datasets except selenomethionine - labeled MN - C2 were collected at the Advanced Photon Source at Argone National Labora - tory on NE - CAT beamlines 24ID - C and 24ID - E . The datasets for labeled MN - C2 were collected at beamline 8 . 2 . 2 at the Advanced Light Source . We screened 3046 crystals , collected and processed more than 400 promising datasets to build the ﬁnal K . lactis MIND - C1 structure . X - ray Structure Determination MIND - C1 MIND - C1 native and mercury - derivative crystals are both in space group P2 1 , with one complex per asymmetric unit . Soaking with ethylmercurithiosalicylic acid ( EMTS ) made the derivate non - isomorphous , however , and not useful for phasing by isomorphous replacement . Anomalous signal from selenomethionine - substituted and tantalum bromide - derivatized crystals was too weak to be used for de novo phasing , but proved useful for structure validation ( see below and also Figure S2 ) . We therefore obtained starting phases from the mercury anomalous signal , relying on high redundancy for adequate signal ( Akey et al . , 2014 ) . We processed with XDS ( Kabsch , 2010 ) the single anomalous dispersion ( SAD ) data from 37 mercury derivative crystals . We only reﬁned crystal orientation and unit cell dimensions in the INTEGRATE step but carried out full post - reﬁnement of experimental pa - rameters in CORRECT . We observed substantial ﬂuctuations in data quality in frames recorded along the goniometer rotation , pre - sumably because of the small crystal size ( 10 - 15 m m ) and the difﬁculty in mounting single ones . We therefore excluded frames for which the mosaicity exceeded a heuristically determined threshold . After comparing individual crystals to a reference dataset ( cross R factors ) , we selected 33 and scaled them together in XSCALE . The merged data used for phasing have over 30 - fold redundancy and anomalous signal to about 5 A˚ resolution ( Table S1 ) . We found 6 mercury sites using SHELXD ( Sheldrick , 2010 ) , reﬁned them in SHARP ( Vonrhein et al . , 2007 ) and calculated phase probabilities . Initial maps were obtained after statistical density modiﬁcation using RESOLVE ( 54 % solvent content ) ( Terwilliger , 2000 ) ( Figure S2A ) . Phases for the native , two selenomethionine - substituted and a tantalum - derivatized crystal forms were determined by molecular replacement using PHASER ( McCoy et al . , 2007 ) . For this , we ﬂooded the initial map with dummy atoms and carved out individual domains by inspection in PyMol ( Schro¨dinger , LLC ) . To extract density , we used masks calculated from the dummy atom domain models . As we know a posteriori , the domains are head I , head II , coiled - coil 1 ( CC1 ) , coiled - coil 2 ( CC2 ) and the third part of the rod ( CC3 ) . Molecular replacement solutions were difﬁcult to obtain when we used density of the whole complex as a search model . We attribute this difﬁculty to the differences between crystal forms in bending or twisting along the rod of MIND - C1 , leading to an overall poor match due to the extended shape of the complex . We therefore tested different combinations of domains as search models and found solutions when head I , CC1 and CC2 were deﬁned as a single rigid group . We subsequently could place head II and CC3 ( plus a nanobody in case of SeMet II and Tantalum ) . In the native crystal form , MIND - C1 is shifted about 5 A˚ in the a / c - plane with respect to the crystallographic origin with respect to its position in the mercury derivative , conﬁrming non - isomorphism . To obtain better phases , we used the MN - C2 head I structure ( see below ) as partial model for SAD phasing in PHASER and multi - crystal density averaging with DMMULTI ( Cowtan , 1994 ) and PHENIX multi _ crystal _ average ( Adams et al . , 2010 ) , applying the pre - viously determined domain masks and transformation matrices obtained from the molecular replacement solutions . The visual appearance of the resulting maps convinced us that we had obtained reasonable phase information to approximately 4 . 5 A˚ resolution ( Figure S2A ) , but phase extension to the diffraction limit in the native crystal form worked poorly , because of the lower resolution limits for the other crystal forms and the native - crystal solvent content of only 54 % . We built poly - alanine models for the helical parts of the complex manually and with PHENIX ﬁnd _ helices _ strands . We matched the lengths and positions of observed helices to secondary structure predictions ( https : / / www . predictprotein . org / ) ( Yachdav et al . , 2014 ) , thereby obtaining a consistent picture of all subunit connectivities . We assigned the amino - acid sequence with the help of cysteine and methionine positions observed in anomalous difference Fourier maps calculated from the mercury - and the two sele - nomethionine - substituted crystal forms of MIND - C1 , respectively . The anomalous difference Fourier analysis conﬁrmed the position of 6 out of 7 cysteines and 10 out of 17 methionines ( Figure S2B ) . We completed the model by iterations of interactive model building in O ( Jones et al . , 1991 ) with reﬁnement . Native diffraction data were processed as described above for the mercury derivative . Because of strong anisotropy , we ellipsoi - dally truncated native intensities at Bragg spacings of 3 . 2 , 4 . 1 , 3 . 4 A˚ along the crystallographic a * , b * and c * axis , respectively , using the anisotropy server ( Figure S2C ) ( Strong et al . , 2006 ) . After conversion of intensities to structure factor amplitudes , we applied an overall isotropic Wilson B factor of 80 A˚ 2 . We reﬁned the model in PHENIX with individually restrained coordinates and B factors , applying rotamer and secondary structure restraints throughout the reﬁnement , and analyzed the ﬁnal model with MolProbity ( Chen et al . , 2010 ) . Reﬁnement and model statis - tics are in Table S1 . The ﬁnal model includes Mtw1 ( residues 1 - 233 ) , Nnf1 ( 8 - 203 ) , Nsl1 ( 5 - 216 ) and Dsn1 ( 253 - 471 ) . Flexible residues that have not been traced in the electron density map include Nnf1 ( 180 - 185 ) , Nsl1 ( 151 - 166 ) , and Dsn1 ( 230 - 252 , 344 - 348 , 406 - 418 and 472 - 479 ) . We modeled all but ﬁve omitted residues in the long loop of Dsn1 , residues 311 - 353 , as poly - alanine ( 311 - 343 , 349 - 353 ) . Electron density for the segments Mtw1 44 - 58 and 169 - 188 is poor and did not allow conﬁdent assignment of backbone ste - reochemistry , and C a positions will have larger errors than in the rest of the model . However , the former segment is well deﬁned in the MN - C2 structure . Cell 167 , 1014 – 1027 . e1 – e6 , November 3 , 2016 e4 The ﬁnal R factors with R work / R free of 32 . 2 / 36 . 3 % are higher than expected for a 3 . 2 A˚ resolution structure , because of the strongly anisotropic diffraction ( Figure S2C ) . If we calculate R factors with data cut off at 3 . 8 A˚ resolution , at which completeness drops below 84 % and thus is a more realistic number for the overall resolution for the electron density map , R work / R free is 31 . 3 / 34 . 8 % and within the acceptable range of R factors observed for structures in the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) determined at similar resolution . The native unit - cell dimensions , with a and c almost equal in length ( Table S1 ) , could in principle allow pseudo - merohedral twinning in space group P2 1 . Native moments and the L - test ( Padilla and Yeates , 2003 ) calculated from intensities or amplitudes with phenix . xtriage do not indicate twinning ( the expected values calculated from acentric reﬂections for untwinned and perfectly twinned crystals , respectively , are given in parenthesis ) : < I 2 > / < I > 2 = 2 . 04 ( 2 . 0 , 1 . 5 ) , < F > 2 / < F 2 > = 0 . 797 ( 0 . 785 , 0 . 885 ) , < j E 2 - 1 j > = 0 . 716 ( 0 . 736 , 0 . 541 ) , < j L j > = 0 . 471 ( 0 . 500 , 0 . 375 ) , < L 2 > = 0 . 301 ( 0 . 333 , 0 . 200 ) . We also excluded twinning by test reﬁnement with ‘‘l , - k , h’’ as twin law , obtaining R work / R free equal to 31 . 0 / 36 . 3 % , with a twin fraction of 0 . 11 . MN - C2 Native and selenomethionine - labeled MN - C2 ( Mtw1 1 - 120 / Nnf1 1 - 102 ) complex both crystallized in space group P6 2 . We indexed and integrated the data with XDS and used 13 SAD datasets from 11 selenomethionine - labeled crystal of MN - C2 for phase determination . We located the heavy atom sites with SHELXD ( Sheldrick , 2010 ) and used them as input in PHENIX AutoSol wizard ( Terwilliger et al . , 2009 ) for phase calculation with PHASER and solventﬂattening with RESOLVE ( Terwilliger , 2000 ) . We completedan initial model from PHENIX AutoBuild by iterative rounds of manual building in Coot ( Emsley et al . , 2010 ) and reﬁned it with phenix . reﬁne ( Adams et al . , 2010 ) ( Table S2 ) . The ﬁnal model includes Mtw1 residues 3 - 98 and Nnf1 residues 13 - 102 . MN - C2 - Mif2 1 - 41 Complex Rod - shaped crystals of the MN - C2 ( Mtw1 1 - 120 / Nnf1 1 - 102 ) - Mif2 1 - 41 complex were in space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 ( Table S2 ) . Diffraction was anisotropic and required ellipsoidal truncation of the intensities at Bragg spacings of 3 . 1 , 2 . 4 , 2 . 9 A˚ along the crystallographic a * , b * and c * axis , respectively , using the anisotropy server ( Strong et al . , 2006 ) . We determined the structure of the complex by molecular replacement with PHASER ( McCoy et al . , 2007 ) using MN - C2 as a search model ( two molecules per asymmetric unit with 51 % sol - vent content ) . We built the Mif2 peptide into difference maps with Coot and O and reﬁned the ﬁnal model ( Figure 2B ) , including Mif2 residues 5 - 38 , with phenix . reﬁne ( Afonine et al . , 2012 ) . Spc24 / Spc25 - Dsn1 Complex Crystals of S . cerevisiae Spc24 155 - 213 / Spc25 133 - 221 - Dsn1 560 - 572 complex grew in space group I4 1 22 with one molecule per asym - metric unit . We indexed and integrated reﬂections using XDS and scaled the data using the CCP4 - suite program Aimless ( Winn et al . , 2011 ) . We determined phases by molecular replacement in PHASER with the crystal structure of Spc24 / Spc25 as a search model ( PDB : 2FTX ) ( McCoy et al . , 2007 ) and used difference F o - F c maps from Phaser and composite omit maps calculated with PHENIX to build the peptide ( plus two N - terminal residues inherited from the TEV protease cleavage site , Ser - 2 and Asn - 1 ) with Coot ( Emsley et al . , 2010 ) . We reﬁned the model with maximum likelihood targets in phenix . reﬁne ( Afonine et al . , 2012 ) ( Table S2 ) . The ﬁnal model includes the entire sequences of Spc24 155 - 213 and Spc25 133 - 221 and residues 560 - 571 of Dsn1 . Binding Studies by Size Exclusion Chromatography Analytical size exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) experiments were performed at 4 (cid:2) C on a Superdex - S200 Increase 10 / 300 GL col - umn ( GE Healthcare ) . Protein samples were mixed at different concentrations , speciﬁed in the ﬁgure legends for each experimental complex , and incubated for 30 min on ice before injecting onto the column in a ﬁnal volume of 200 m l . The SEC buffer for binding experiments with S . cerevisiae Spc24 155 - 213 / Spc25 133 - 221 included 30 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM TCEP . The rest of the experiments testing the interaction of MIND - C1 , head I and head II mutants with different binding partners ( Figures 2 , 3 , 5 , and 6 ) were with an SEC buffer containing 50 mM CHES , pH 9 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM TCEP . Elution fractions were resolved on 4 % – 20 % SDS - PAGE gels and stained with Coomassie blue . Binding Studies by Fluorescence Polarization We carried out binding experiments in low - volume 384 well plates ( Corning ) on a SpectraMax M5 e instrument ( Molecular Devices ) at 23 (cid:2) C ( excitation wavelength , 484 nm ; emission wavelength , 525 nm ) . FITC - Mif2 1 - 41 and FITC - Ame1 1 - 25 peptides were synthesized by the Tufts University Core Facility . Each reaction contained FITC - labeled peptide at 50 nM and concentrations of MIND - C1 , MIND - C1 : D205 and MIND - C1 : D205 - 2D ( see Figure S1 for MIND construct details ) ranging from 0 – 10 m M . The experiments were done in 50 mM CHES , pH 9 , 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM TCEP in a ﬁnal volume of 20 m l . We also carried out binding experiments of S . cerevisiae Spc24 / Spc25 with Dsn1 and Mtw1 peptides in conditions similar to the protocol described above .
