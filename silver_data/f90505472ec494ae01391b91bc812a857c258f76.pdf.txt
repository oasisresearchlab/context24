During these events , the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton act in concert with the cellular machinery that controls endo - and exocytosis , thus regulating polarized traffic of mem - branes and membrane - associated pro - teins . Small GTPases of the Rho family orchestrate cytoskeletal dynamics . Rho GTPase signaling is tightly regulated and mislocalization or constitutive activation may lead to , for example , morphogenetic abnormalities , tumor cell metastasis or apoptosis . There is increas - ing evidence that traffic to and from the plasma membrane constitutes an import - ant mechanism controlling Rho GTPase activation and signaling . This brief over - view discusses a group of proteins that function at the interface between mem - brane dynamics and RhoGTPase signal - ing . These proteins all share a so - called BAR domain , which is a lipid and pro - tein binding region that also harbors membrane deforming activity . In the past 15 years , a growing number of BAR domain proteins have been identified and found to regulate Rho GTPase signaling . The studies discussed here define several modes of RhoGTPase regulation through BAR - domain containing proteins , identi - fying the BAR domain as an important regulatory unit bridging membrane traffic and cytoskeletal dynamics . Introduction Rho GTPases constitute a distinct sub - family within the superfamily of Ras - related small GTPases and are involved in the regulation of cell polarity and motility through their effects on the actin cytos - keleton , membrane traffic and cell adhe - sion . 1 , 2 RhoGTPases act as molecular switches , cycling between an inactive GDP - bound state and an active GTP - bound state . This transition is regulated by guanine - nucleotide - exchange factors ( GEFs ) that promote the exchange of GDP for GTP 3 and by GTPase activating proteins ( GAPs ) that stimulate the low intrinsic GTPase activity . 4 While acti - vated Rho GTPases generally are localized at the plasma membrane , inactive Rho GTPases , with some exceptions , e . g . , RhoB , associate with a cytosolic chaper - one Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor ( RhoGDI ) . 5 Increasing evidence indicates that traffic to and from the plasma membrane is an important event controlling Rho GTPase signaling . For example , active Rac1 resides in cholesterol - enriched membrane domains 6 and cell detachment can trigger inter - nalization of these domains resulting in the inactivation of Rac1 . Thus , interna - lization plays a key role in the regulation of Rac1 activity . In line with this , it was shown that the large GTPase Dynamin , which is involved in endocytosis , plays an indispensable role in Rac1 traffic . Dynamin inhibition results in an increase in Rac1 activity . 7 This is accompanied by a relocation of active Rac1 to aberrant dorsal ruffles which results in inhibition of cell spreading and lamellipodia forma - tion . 7 Conversely , Rho GTPases control endocytosis and membrane dynamics . For example , Cdc42 regulates the uptake of GPI - anchored proteins and bacterial toxins via the CLIC / GEEC pathway which functions independently from COMMENTARY Small GTPases 3 : 1 , 45 – 52 ; January / February / March 2012 ; G 2012 Landes Bioscience www . landesbioscience . com Small GTPases 45 © 2012 Landes Bioscience .

In a recent study , we showed that the adaptor protein PACSIN2 regulates the activity of Rac1 . PACSIN2 is an F - BAR and SH3 - domain - containing protein which is involved in membrane dynamics such as tubulation and internalization . Our findings suggest that PACSIN2 controls cell spreading and migration by targeting Rac1 to intracellular compartments for GAP - mediated inactivation . 11 PACSIN2 is part of the BAR - domain family of proteins that are important regulators of membrane dynamics . Currently , this family comprises proteins encoding one of six classes of BAR - domains : the archetypical BAR domain , or N - BAR , BAR - PH , PX - BAR , F - BAR and I - BAR domains . 12 BAR - domain proteins are capable of sensing membrane curvature and , by binding as banana - shaped dimers to phospholipids ( the specificity of lipid binding depends on the type of BAR protein ) , they can further promote curva - ture , which eventually leads either to mem - brane invagination or protrusion depending on the type of BAR domain . 13 As most BAR domain proteins can form dimers and contain one or more protein - binding scaffolding / adaptor domains , they link membrane dynamics to signaling proteins that control actin dynamics . As a result , many BAR - domain containing proteins are potentially important regulators of Rho GTPase - dependent signaling . Here , we discuss the role of BAR - domain proteins in the regulation of Rho GTPases . So far , two classes of BAR - domain proteins have been characterized that affect Rho GTPase function : proteins harboring a BAR domain that regulate Rho GTPase function ( Table 1 ) and proteins that , in addition to their BAR domain , encode a RhoGAP / GEF domain and regulate Rho GTPase activity ( Table 2 ) . Regulation of RhoGTPase Function by BAR Domain Proteins that Lack a RhoGAP / GEF Domain Over the past 15 years , several BAR - domain - containing proteins have been described that regulate the function of RhoGTPases ( Table 1 ) . These proteins are all structurally related and encode , next to the common BAR domain , one or more adaptor - or scaffolding domains ( Fig . 1 ) . Recently , we have shown that the F - BAR domain protein PACSIN2 specifically interacts , through its SH3 domain , with the small GTPase Rac1 . Via its F - BAR domain , PACSIN2 can bind to and induce invagination of the plasma membrane . We found that in HeLa cells , loss of PACSIN2 expression increases Rac1GTP levels and , as a consequence , promotes spreading and migration of cells . The effect of PACSIN2 on Rac1 activity depends on their asso - ciation as well as on membrane binding , since a PACSIN2 BAR - domain mutant , deficient in membrane tubulation , fails to inactivate Rac1 . Furthermore , we showed that inactivation of Rac1 by PACSIN2 is prevented when dynamin is inhibited . Our Table1 .

Do not distribute . data , therefore , suggest a model in which PACSIN2 , in conjunction with dynamin , promotes internalization of Rac1GTP , subsequently targeting it to intracellular sites for GAP - mediated inactivation . 11 Another family of F - BAR domain - containing proteins that controls RhoGTPase function is the CIP4 family , consisting of CIP4 and Toca - 1 . Both CIP4 and Toca - 1 interact with the small GTPase Cdc42 in fibroblasts , 14 , 15 regulat - ing Cdc42 - dependent actin reorganiza - tion . 15 , 16 Activated Cdc42 interacts with Toca - 1 and the N - WASP - WIP ( WASP - interacting protein ) complex which leads to activation of N - WASP and Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization . 15 Similar to Toca - 1 , CIP4 is an effector of activated Cdc42 . 14 In addition , CIP4 promotes formation of invadopodia in breast cancer cells through the activation of N - WASP . 16 Both CIP4 and Toca - 1 localize to mem - branes via their F - BAR domains where they act as scaffolding proteins for N - WASP and Cdc42 . Whether the F - BAR domain is dispensable for this function remains to be established . However , it is worth mentioning that binding of Cdc42 and N - WASP to Toca - 1 regulates its tubulating capacity which depends on its F - BAR domain as an F - BAR domain mutant failed to induce tubulation even in presence of activated Cdc42 and N - WASP . 17 Interestingly , a third family member , FBP17 ( forming - binding protein 17 ) , is involved in actin reorganization as well . Similar to CIP4 and Toca - 1 , FBP17 localizes to sites of membrane curvature via its F - BAR domain and targets the N - WASP - WIP complex to the membrane , stimulating Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization . 18 However , unlike Toca - 1 and CIP4 , FBP17 does not interact with Cdc42 , 19 leaving its mode of regulation to be established . Another F - BAR domain protein that acts in conjunction with Cdc42 is Nwk ( Nervous Wreck ) . Nwk is present at the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction . The mammalian genome encodes two Nwk homologs but these have not been characterized yet . 20 Drosophila Nwk inter - acts with various endocytic proteins via its SH3 domain and promotes , together with Cdc42 , WASP - mediated actin polymeriza - tion , which is important in the regulation of synaptic morphology . 20 The exact role of the F - BAR domain and whether Nwk physically interacts with Cdc42 , similar to CIP4 and Toca - 1 , remains to be established . In addition to the proteins discussed above , one other family of BAR domain - containing proteins has been described to control RhoGTPase function . This family consists of IRSp53 , MIM ( B ) and Abba . They all share an N - terminal IMD domain which is also known as I - BAR domain . IRSp53 is an effector of both Rac1 and Cdc42 and binds to active Rac1 via the I - BAR domain and to active Figure1 . BAR - Domain proteins lacking a RhoGAP / GEF domain that regulate Rho GTPase function . Several BAR - domain - containing proteins have been shown to regulate Rho GTPase function . These proteins encode , in addition to their common BAR domain , one or more adaptor or scaffolding domains .

Cdc42 via its CRIB domain . 21 , 22 IRSp53 mediates the interaction between Rac1 and WAVE2 ( via its SH3 domain ) which is important because WAVE proteins , unlike WASP , lack a GTPase binding domain ( GBD ) . IRSp53 thus couples Rac1 to WAVE2 resulting in proper actin polymerization and formation of lamelli - podia . 22 , 23 In addition to its function in Rac1 - dependent actin dynamics , IRSp53 also acts as a Cdc42 effector stimulating the formation of filopodia by coupling membrane protrusion ( mediated by the I - BAR domain ) with actin dynamics through SH3 - domain mediated interac - tions with proteins such as N - WASP . 21 , 24 Thus , whereas the IRSp53 I - BAR domain is involved in both Rac1 binding and formation of protrusions ( by creating outward curvature ) , for Cdc4 , the I - BAR domain mainly functions to create out - ward curvature . Via its CRIB domain , IRSp53 targets activated Cdc42 to these sites . Unlike IRSp53 , which mediates signals from both Rac1 and Cdc42 , Abba and MIM ( B ) interact with Rac1 but not with Cdc42 . Whereas Abba associates to GTP - bound Rac1 , MIM ( B ) binds Rac1 in a nucleotide - independent fashion . 25 , 26 MIM ( B ) binds and bundles actin filaments and induces membrane protrusions through the interaction with and activa - tion of Rac1 ( both processes mediated via the IMD / I - BAR domain ) . Moreover , MIM ( B ) acts as a scaffold protein to recruit Rac1 effectors that drive actin assembly . 25 , 27 Abba regulates plasma - membrane - and actin dynamics as well and interacts with Rac1 via its IMD / I - BAR domain , similar to MIM ( B ) . 28 Abba localizes with active Rac1 in membrane ruffles and was shown to bind to both wild - type and constitutively active Rac1 . 26 PDGF treatment enhanced the Abba - Rac1 interaction and an Abba mutant , deficient in Rac1 binding , prevented Rac1 activa - tion and induction of membrane ruffling by PDGF . 26 These results reveal an important role for Abba in Rac1 signaling downstream of the PDGF receptor . Thus , it is clear that BAR - domain proteins play key roles in regulating RhoGTPases and that the BAR domain itself is important for this function . Although BAR - domain proteins have similar structures , the mechanisms by which they regulate GTPases differ . Whereas some are targeted , via their BAR domain , to specific sites to control GTPase traffic ( e . g . , PACSIN2 ) , or act in concert with GTPases to ensure efficient activation of downstream signaling ( e . g . , Toca - 1 ) , others form a physical link via their BAR domain between GTPases and their upstream activators ( e . g . , Abba ) or downstream effectors ( e . g . , IRSp53 ) . Moreover , some of the BAR - domain proteins ( e . g . , Toca - 1 ) act either as positive regulators or signal transducers , whereas others ( e . g . , PACSIN2 ) serve to down - regulate GTPase output . Regulation of RhoGTPase Function and Activation by BAR Domain - Containing GAPs or GEFs A large number of RhoGEF and RhoGAP proteins have been identified so far . 3 , 29 More recently , several of these GAP / GEF proteins were shown to contain a BAR domain as well ( Table 2 ) and to have important functions in controlling the activity and consequently the function of RhoGTPases . Similar to the BAR - domain proteins described in the previous section , these BAR - GAP / GEF proteins are struc - turally similar in that they all harbor a BAR domain , a GAP / GEF domain , and one or more scaffolding domains / regions ( Fig . 2 ) . The Slit - Robo ( sr ) GAPs are critical for neuronal migration because of their inactivation of RhoGTPases . Four differ - ent family members ( srGAP1 - 4 ) have been characterized . 30 - 33 Slit proteins are secreted , cell or extracellular matrix - associated proteins that guide neuronal migration through binding to the trans - membrane Robo receptors . Slit proteins increase the interaction between Robo1 and srGAP1 which results in the activation of srGAP1 and consequent inactivation of GTPases . 33 Whereas srGAP1 regulates Cdc42 , both srGAP2 and srGAP3 mediate their function through inactivation of Rac1 . The srGAP2 F - BAR domain pro - motes formation of filopodia - like mem - brane protrusions and neurite outgrowth in cortical neurons . 31 Thus , the F - BAR and RhoGAP domain of srGAP2 cooper - ate to regulate neuronal cell migration . The third family member , srGAP3 / WRP , is part of the WAVE1 complex . 34 WAVE1 induces actin polymerization downstream of activated Rac1 . 35 As part of the WAVE1 complex , srGAP3 / WRP functions as a signal - termination factor for Rac1 through its Rac1 - GAP activity . 34 Furthermore , srGAP3 / WRP regulates spine develop - ment through F - BAR domain - dependent formation of dendritic filopodia , and loss of srGAP3 / WRP results in impaired long - term memory in mice . 30 Finally , the less - well characterized srGAP family member srGAP4 / p115 , is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells and was shown to stimulate the intrinsic GTPase activity of RhoA and to inhibit stress - fiber formation . 32 Furthermore , srGAP4 / p115 associates to MEKK1 , thereby reducing MEKK1 - induced signaling to the transcription factor AP - 1 . 36 However , additional studies are necessary to under - stand the biological function of srGAP4 / p115 and the role of the F - BAR domain in this process . Similar to srGAPs , RICH1 ( also called Nadrin ) , is a BAR domain - containing protein which also posseses a RhoGAP domain . RICH1 shows GAP activity toward Cdc42 , Rac1 , and RhoA . 37 , 38 3T3 fibroblasts expressing full - length RICH1 or its isolated GAP domain were unable to form membrane ruffles after PDGF stimu - lation . 38 Furthermore , RICH1 localizes to tight - and adherens junctions in epithelial cells , mediated through its interaction with the adaptor protein Amot . RICH1 associates via its BAR domain with the ACCH domain of Amot . 39 , 40 This inter - action inhibits RICH1 function prevent - ing RICH1 from properly downregulating activated Cdc42 . In addition , Amot induces relocalization of the polarity proteins Pals1 and Par - 3 . Thus , RICH1 in conjunction with Amot maintains the integrity of tight junctions through the regulation of Cdc42 activity and traffick - ing of polarity proteins . 39 As an additional member of this family RICH2 , a RacGAP , was identified as a regulator of the actin cytoskeleton in epithelial cells . RICH2 and Ezrin interact with the integral membrane protein CD317 linking it to the actin cytoskeleton at the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells . 41 As RICH2 inhibits formation of Rac1 - induced 48 Small GTPases Volume 3 Issue 1 © 2012 Landes Bioscience . Do not distribute . membrane ruffles , 38 its presence in this complex possibly ensures proper regu - lation of actin cytoskeleton remodeling at the apical side of polarized epithelial cells . The exact role of the BAR domain is not known in this process although it could well be that RICH2 is targeted to the membrane ( where it interacts with CD317 ) via the lipid - binding properties of the BAR domain . In addition to the srGAP family and the RICH family , one more family of BAR - domain containing RhoGAP proteins is expressed in mammalian cells . The GRAF ( GTPase regulator associated with focal adhesion kinase - 1 ) family consists of four members , GRAF 1 - 3 and Oligophrenin - 1 . GRAF proteins play a role in the clathrin - independent endocytosis pathway CLIC / GEEC . 42 GRAF1 exhibits GAP activity toward RhoA and Cdc42 and binds to Focal Adhesion Kinase ( FAK ) via its SH3 domain . 43 Moreover , GRAF1 regulates the uptake of , for example , GPI - anchored proteins and bacterial toxins via the CLIC / GEEC pathway and internalization via this pathway was shown to be dependent on Cdc42 activation . 8 , 44 Through its BAR domain , GRAF1 localizes to tubular and vesicular membranes that define the CLIC / GEEC pathway . Here , GRAF1 regulates internalization of cargo by regu - lating the activity of Cdc42 via its GAP domain . Depletion of GRAF1 , leading to impaired CLIC / GEEC function , reduces cell spreading and migration 45 indicating the importance of well - coordinated mem - brane dynamics and protein traffic in the control of cell shape and motility . A close relative of GRAF1 , Oligophrenin - 1 , stimulates GTP hydrolysis of Cdc42 , Rac1 , and RhoA . 46 Through the regula - tion of GTPase activity and the interac - tion with endophilin A1 , Oligophrenin - 1 controls synaptic vesicle endocytosis . 47 Figure2 . BAR - Domain - containing RhoGAP / GEF proteins . Several BAR - domain proteins have been characterized that harbor , in addition to their BAR domain , a RhoGAP / GEF domain also . In addition , they encode of one or more scaffolding or adaptor domains . Abbreviations for domains are as follows : BAR , Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs ; C1 , cysteine - rich phorbol ester binding ; F - BAR , Fes / CIP4 homology Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs ; PH , pleckstrin homology ; RhoGAP , Rho GTPase activating protein ; RhoGEF , Rho guanine - nucleotide - exchange factors ; SH3 , Src homology 3 .

Oligophrenin - 1 was also shown to be involved in cognitive impairment . 46 As malfunctions in synaptic vesicle recycling are linked to cognitive defects 48 it could well be that Oligophrenin - 1 - associated cognitive impairment is caused by a defect in synaptic vesicle traffic due to improper Oligophrenin - 1 signaling . A third GRAF family member , GRAF2 , also known as PSGAP , has been shown to interact with PYK2 which is structur - ally related to FAK . PYK2 binds to the GRAF2 SH3 domain thereby inhibiting its RhoGAP function . This results in activation of Cdc42 and cytoskeletal reorganization . 49 The exact role of the GRAF2 BAR domain needs further investigation , but it could well be involved in targeting of GRAF2 to sites where GTPase regulation is required . Finally , two more BAR - RhoGAP pro - teins have been characterized so far , GMIP and SH3BP1 . 50 , 51 GMIP associates with the Ras - related protein Gem which is involved in regulating voltage - gated Ca 2 + channels and cytoskeletal reorganization ( Aresta et al . , 2002 ; Beguin et al . , 2001 ) . 50 , 52 Gem , which binds Ezrin at the plasma membrane , downregulates RhoA - dependent stress fibers via its inter - action with GMIP which exhibits GAP activity toward RhoA but not Cdc42 and Rac1 . 50 , 53 The exact role of the GMIP BAR domain remains unclear . However , it was shown that the GMIP - Gem interaction is mediated via the GMIP N - terminal part which harbors the BAR domain . 50 Similar to IRSp53 , 22 GMIP possibly uses its BAR domain for pro - tein - protein interactions . SH3BP1 exhibits GAP activity toward the Rac family GTPases and was shown to inhibit PDGF - induced membrane ruffling . 51 Furthermore , it was shown that SH3BP1 binds Exo84 and Sec8 , both exocyst components , in a BAR domain - dependent fashion . 54 Together with the exocyst , SH3BP1 is targeted to the leading edge of polarized , motile cells . Here it mediates cell migration by regulating the activity of Rac1 . Loss of SH3BP1 causes formation of disorganized instable protru - sions . 54 Thus at the leading edge , in con - cert with GEF - mediated activation of Rac1 , SH3BP1 ensures proper Rac1 inactivation to mediate efficient cell migration . Whereas several RhoGAP proteins encode BAR domains , only one BAR - RhoGEF protein , called Tuba , has been described so far . Tuba has four N - terminal SH3 domains , a central DH domain followed by a BAR domain and two C - terminal SH3 domains ( Fig . 2 ) . Tuba was shown to exhibit GEF activity toward Cdc42 but not Rac1 and RhoA . 55 , 56 As Tuba can bind both Dynamin and actin - regulatory proteins such as N - WASP and WAVE1 , 56 Tuba was proposed to be an important link between endocytosis , actin dynamics , and GTPase signaling . 56 Furthermore , Tuba activates Cdc42 and subsequently atypical PKC , thereby regu - lating polarized spindle orientation in epithelial cells . 57 To be functional , RhoGEF proteins generally need a DH - PH motif . The DH domain forms the catalytic core while the PH domain can be involved in plasma membrane targeting and in protein - protein interactions . 3 In general , DH domains without adjacent PH domains are less active than those that are flanked by a PH domain . 3 Intriguingly , it was shown that the Tuba DH domain showed little activity com - pared with the DH - BAR fragment . 56 This suggests that the BAR domain of Tuba acts as a substitute for a PH domain . It is clear that BAR - GAP / GEF proteins are important regulators of GTPase activa - tion and consequent signaling . In general , the BAR domain is important for the targeting to membranes and to sites of actin dynamics where they can induce membrane curvature . In addition , the BAR domain can mediate protein - protein interactions . Thus , the BAR domain and GAP / GEF domain cooperate to regulate processes dependent on membrane traffic and actin remodeling including cell spreading , cell polarization and motility . It is perhaps not coincidental that appar - ently more RhoGAPs than RhoGEFs encode BAR domains . GTPase activation is generally associated with the trans - location to the plasma membrane . Although it is not as firmly established that turning off GTPase signaling requires the reverse process , e . g . , GTPase inter - nalization , there is accumulating support for this notion , based on previous studies showing that e . g . , dynamin , caveolin - 1 and PACSIN2 are all required for proper Rac1 inactivation . The fact that also many RhoGAPs encode BAR domains therefore suggest a functional link between membrane traffic and termination of GTPase signaling . Concluding Remarks Over the past 15 years , a series of BAR domain - containing proteins have been characterized that are linked to Rho GTPase signaling pathways . The BAR domain itself , through its capacity to bind lipids as well as proteins , plays an important role in the regulation of Rho GTPase activity and output . BAR domains play important roles in the targeting of proteins to specific regions within the plasma membrane where actin remodeling is necessary ( e . g . , for formation of protrusions or stimulating endocytosis ) . At these sites , BAR - domain proteins can control Rho GTPase activity , either by regulating the activation status of Rho GTPases , as some of these proteins harbor a RhoGAP / GEF domain , or by linking Rho GTPases to their upstream activators ( e . g . , growth factor signaling ) or to their downstream effectors ( e . g . , the actin machinery proteins such as WASP pro - teins and the Arp2 / 3 complex ) . Strikingly , the Rho GTPase - regulating BAR domain proteins identified so far all harbor BAR , F - BAR , or I - BAR domains but not any of the other types of BAR domain . In conclusion , BAR - domain proteins are emerging as an important group of RhoGTPase regulators . As this field is relatively young and many previously identified proteins are now found to also include a BAR domain , it is very likely that in the near future more BAR - domain proteins that regulate Rho GTPase signal - ing will be identified . The challenge then lies in defining their contribution to the promotion or inhibition of localized GTPase signaling . Acknowledgments This work was supported by an LSBR grant to P . L . H .
