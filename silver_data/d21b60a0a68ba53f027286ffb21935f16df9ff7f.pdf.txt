Online discussions that span diverse agendas can help readers mitigate the biased influences from news media . However , displaying comments based on popular voting often fails to reveal such diversities to readers . In this paper , we de - signed a proof - of - concept Hagendas that aims to improve awareness of divergent agendas in online news discussions . It presents possi - ble agendas automatically derived from news articles , and enables readers to view and filter the comments accordingly . We evaluated how Hagendas would affect users’ online news discussion practices through a within - subjects experiment with 95 online participants from MTurk . While the agenda tags and filtering features did not significantly increase the number of distinct agendas people iden - tified through reading comments , 77 . 9 % of participants preferred having those features for exploring online news discussion .

In this paper , we denote such topics of comments as ‘agendas’ . However , the current ways of displaying news - related comments in social media are not supportive for users to stay aware of divergent agendas of comments shared by the public [ 13 , 14 ] . The vast amount of comments under a thread are often presented in an ordered fashion such as recency or popularity ( e . g . , ‘Best’ , ‘Top’ sorting in Reddit ) . While such display methods could help screen out low - quality comments , it holds a drawback that comments with relatively less popular but valuable agendas would not be easily visible to the public [ 24 ] . In addition , those whose perspective is seemingly different from that of the majority as revealed in the popular comments may hesitate to speak out ( a . k . a . the spiral of silence [ 22 , 32 ] ) , which could further discourage sharing comments with divergent subjects . Prior studies have explored various methods to increase readers’ awareness of divergent opinions in online spaces . One stream of research focused on organizing comments by their contents in dichotomous settings [ 14 , 17 , 21 ] . This , however , is not sufficient in the context of news because not every discussion falls into a bilateral setting . Other work attempted to summarize the contents of large - scale threaded comments through a text analytic visualization ( e . g . , Sankey diagram [ 15 , 16 ] ) to show their topic distributions . Although these tools are effective means to encapsulate existing subjects in the comments , they still leave out any related agendas that have never been voiced out in the discussion . Little work has studied how to let readers aware of unvoiced topics from comments in online news discussions . In this regard , we designed Hagendas ( H ashtag + agendas ) , a proof - of - concept for improving readers’ awareness of divergent agendas in online news discussion . It derives five agendas from the headline and the first sentence of the news article as they usu - ally cover the gist of the news [ 10 , 25 ] . It displays these agendas in the form of hashtags above the threaded discussion ( see Fig 1 ) . Hagendas let users tag agendas when they leave comments . Also , it supports users to filter comments relevant to each of presented agenda . We conducted a within - subjects online experiment with 95 participants ( 57 male , 38 female ) . We counterbalanced three con - ditions : [ i ] the Baseline : mimicked the interface of a popular online forum ( i . e . , r / news in Reddit ) , where the comments are displayed 99 CSCW ’21 Companion , October 23 – 27 , 2021 , Virtual Event , USA Kim , et al .

The possible agendas for discussion about the news article are displayed on [ C ] . Users can tag any corresponding tags among [ C ] for their comments . By clicking ones in [ D ] , users can check corresponding comments for the agenda . by popular votes of the crowd , [ ii ] Agenda tags : baseline interface + displaying agenda tags , and [ iii ] Agendas & Filters : Agenda tags interface + enabling comment filters by associated agenda tags . Participants found new agendas more with Agendas & Filters . They noted that filtering comments by agendas enabled them to search comments easier . In addition , they preferred having those two fea - tures significantly more than the baseline , especially for exploring comments and discussions online . 2 HAGENDAS : MANIFESTING POSSIBLE AGENDAS FOR DISCUSSIONS ONLINE As illustrated in Fig . 1 , we mimicked the essential features of r / news in Reddit , which is a popular place for sharing comments to dis - cuss social issues with online news articles . Our proof - of - concept , Hagendas , generates five possible agendas for discussion threads , and display them on [ C ] as a form of hashtag to let commentators consider the provided agendas while leaving their comments , and [ D ] to improve the readers’ awareness of diverse agendas from others’ comments . We decided to present five agendas because we did not want to overwhelm readers by providing too many agendas , but still present a number of agendas that would spark divergent considerations on the issue . We described the details of how the agendas are derived in 2 . 1 . Followings are the rationales for the key features of Hagendas : • Hashtag : Hagendas extracts possible agendas from news headline and article contents . Then it presents the agendas as a form of tag , to resemble the prior use cases of hashtags for raising the public awareness [ 18 , 19 ] . • Word - level : Hagendas provides word - level tags , neither a phrase - level nor clause - level , as they may impose a particular intention with a specific viewpoint ( e . g . , # BlackLivesMatter ) . In such cases , readers often lose the motivation to read the contents of the post [ 27 ] , which is against our intention . • Filtering : Hagendas allows readers filtering to leave associ - ated comments by the attached agendas . Once a user clicks one of the tags , the system shows the comments with the corresponding hashtag . 2 . 1 Identifying Possible Agendas We implemented a natural language processing ( NLP ) pipeline to extract agendas from online news articles . First , the pipeline identifies nouns , using Stanford CoreNLP Part - of - Speech ( POS ) tag - ger [ 30 , 31 ] and spaCy Named Entity Recognition ( NER ) model [ 8 ] , from the headline and the first sentence of a news article where the important aspects of the article are presented [ 25 , 26 ] . Then it clus - ters similar agendas using Google’s word2vec pre - trained model [ 1 ] to avoid presenting agendas with similar or replaceable ones . Only one representative agenda from each cluster will be chosen . The pipeline utilizes WordNet [ 11 , 20 ] and selects the agenda farthest from the core node ( i . e . , ‘entity’ ) as the representative agenda of each cluster . Table 1 shows examples of the pipeline outputs for seven news articles . 3 ONLINE EXPERIMENT We conducted an online study to evaluate the effects of Hagendas on readers’ experiences in the online news discussion . We recruited 95 participants ( 57 male , 38 female ) from Amazon MTurk . We re - cruited only U . S . residents to ensure the participants to have at least minimal background knowledge on the incidents covered in the articles . They are all with 97 % or higher of acceptance rates to minimize recruiting trolling inputs . Their ages ranged from 21 to 68 ( M = 37 . 96 , SD = 10 . 81 ) . The duration for the completion of the entire task was 55 . 4 minutes on average ( SD = 29 . 7 minutes ) . The participants were compensated with 8 USD for participation . We set up a within - subjects experiment with three interface con - ditions ( [ i ] Baseline , [ ii ] Agenda tags , and [ iii ] Agendas & Filters ) to investigate and compare the effects of different features – tags and filters , respectively . We counterbalanced these three conditions to get rid of ordering effects . The participants read one article per interface condition – ( Wrong Arrest , Lawsuit , and Espionage ) . We fixed the sequence of news articles to mix the pairing between the articles and the interface conditions . On each article , we crawled the top - level comments from Reddit r / news and crowdsourced to label each comment with agendas . • Wrong Arrest [ 6 ] : Police admit they arrested the wrong man , yet he still sits in jail .

S . special forces veteran arrested for passing secrets to Russia . A former U . S . special forces captain has been arrested on charges of espionage , the U . S . Department of Justice says . 3 . 1 Task & Procedure Participants were first asked to fill out a pre - study survey on their basic demographics and familiarity on reading online news articles . Then they were provided a headline and the original link of the news article ( see [ A ] and [ B ] on Fig 1 ) . They were supposed to read the online news article and leave their initial thoughts about it . To prevent them from leaving comments without reading the article , they are only allowed to submit their initial comments at least one minute later from the moment they clicked the link to read the article . In this stage , the participants were not allowed to see the others’ comments to avoid them to leave their thoughts influenced by others . After submitting the initial comment , the participants were allowed to see the comments on the news article with the experimental interface ( Fig 1 ) . They were asked to read other comments at least for a minute and leave their comments again , as if they were leaving a comment on the discussion in social media . They are also required to attach an appropriate agenda to their comment in Agenda tags and Agendas & Filters condition . After submitting a comment , they were asked to answer a short survey , including open - ended questions “From the comments , what agendas have you found ? ” and “Did you make any changes on your comment after looking at others’ comments ? Why did ( or did not ) change your comments ? ” . The participants repeated the procedure for all three interfaces . After using all three interfaces , they were asked to tag their comments with the corresponding agendas . Finally , the participants were asked to respond to a final survey with questions “Among the three systems , in which one of them could you easily find various topics from comments ? ” and “Among three systems , in which one of them could you easily find some comments holding similar topics as yours ? ” 4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We can see that overall participants identified more agendas in total after reading comments in the forum in Agendas & Filters than in Agenda tags , and both surpass Baseline ( see the fifth column in Table 2 ) . However , the Friedman test results show that these differences are insignificant ( p ≥ . 05 ) . Instead , we looked into not just the sheer count but what agendas have been observed by participants in each condition to verify the effects of Hagendas . Improvementonawarenessofdivergentagendas . We found several agendas brought up by more than 10 % of the participants in both conditions [ ii ] and [ iii ] but did not get much attention from the participants in the baseline . For example , participants in both conditions [ ii ] and [ iii ] paid their attentions on victim and felony in others’ comments , while none of participants in the baseline did ( see the Wrong Arrest row in Table 3 ) . Those in the baseline instead identified arrest , admit , and brutality as more salient commentary topics . All these top frequent agendas in the baseline are centered around police in the context of this article – the police arrested the [ wrong man ] , the police admitted [ their fault ] , and the police is brutal . We can also find the similar outcomes in the case of article Lawsuit . Participants found lawsuit , Colorado , and teenager with both conditions [ ii ] and [ iii ] . These agendas how - ever are hardly found by those in the baseline . With the baseline , they noticed shot , murder , and violence , which are describing what the officer committed in the context of the given news article . Prefer having the features . Majority of the participants ( 77 . 9 % : 74 out of 95 ) preferred Hagendas for various reasons but with two difference reasons . A group of them ( 13 out of 41 valid responses ) liked it because the agenda tags and filters helped them gain a quick overview of diverse agendas at a glance , as was our intention . They noted that they could improve their awareness of diverse agendas in news comments through the support of Hagendas features . On the other hand , another group ( 6 out of 41 valid responses ) addressed that the features helped them easily exclude what they do not want to see . It tells us that Hagendas has a potential to enhance users’ filter bubble [ 23 ] or selective exposure [ 12 ] which is against our original intention . Prefer not having the features . In contrast , 22 . 1 % of partici - pants ( 21 out of 95 ) preferred the baseline which is without any agenda tags and filters . Their main claim was any additional features 101 CSCW ’21 Companion , October 23 – 27 , 2021 , Virtual Event , USA Kim , et al .

Although those who preferred Hagendas appreciated the feeling of control over the interface , those who preferred the baseline found themselves mentally and cognitively overloaded with additional features . Therefore , they got lost on how to explore the comments due to the complicated interface . As they do not understand how to manage the novel features , they are more likely to feel overwhelmed [ 29 ] . Designing an effective display of agendas without significantly hindering the comment - reading experiences could be a next step .
