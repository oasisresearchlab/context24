A System for Semantic Integration of Geologic Maps via Ontologies ∗ Kai Lin and Bertram Lud¨ascher San Diego Supercomputer Center University of California at San Diego 9500 Gilman Drive , La Jolla , CA 92093 - 0505 { klin , ludaesch } @ sdsc . edu Abstract This paper describes a prototype system for registering geo - logic data sets through ontologies to assist in integrating and querying heterogeneous geologic data sets . The system con - sists of three components : an ontology repository , the data set registration , and ontology - aware applications . User - deﬁned ontologies in OWL are saved and used by the system . Each data set must be registered before it becomes available , and the registration semi - automatically generates a mapping from data sets to ontologies . The mapping between data sets and ontologies are used by applications to explore and extract in - formation from the data set . Introduction It is widely recognized that ontologies ( Guarino 1998 ) play a central role in modern GIS systems ( Fonseca & Egen - hofer 1999 ) and other scientiﬁc data integration systems ( Lud¨ascher , Gupta , & Martone 2003 ) . A GIS system of - ten needs to integrate heterogeneous data sets with a uniﬁed logical view . However , integrating and using these data sets can be very difﬁcult . This is primarily due to the fact that each data set uses different schema and semantics . In gen - eral , data heterogeneity can be divided into three categories ( Sheth 1998 ; Schuster 2000 ) : syntactic heterogeneity , struc - tural heterogeneity and semantic heterogeneity . Syntactic and structural transformation approaches ( e . g . , database me - diation ) can be used to adequately handle the ﬁrst two kinds of heterogeneities , however , they are not adequate for re - solving semantic differences . The use of ontologies is con - sidered a possible solution of the semantic heterogeneity problem ( Wache et al . 2001 ) . In the GEON project ( GEON 2003 ) we are developing an interoperability framework and system that allows a data provider to register a data set with one or more “mediation ontologies” and subsequently query the different data sets in a uniform fashion . The capability of querying the medi - ated data sets is signiﬁcantly improved when all available data sets are registered in this way : Heterogeneous source vocabularies are made compatible via the ontologies , and multiple conceptual dimensions become queryable simulta - ∗ This work supported in part by the National Science Founda - tion ( NSF ) under grants No .

Within the system a user registers a geologic map using interac - tive tools against previously deﬁned ontologies for geologic age ( Poling 1997 ) and rock types ( Gillespie et al . 1999 ; Struik et al . 2002 ) . Some details of our system are described in the next section . We also report some initial experiences of using the system to build an ontology - enabled map inte - grator ( OMI ) . Design In this section , we discuss the prototype system developed in the GEON project for exploring and integrating geologic data sets . The system consists of three components : the on - tology repository , the data set registration , and ontology - aware applications . Ontology Repository The system accepts and saves user - deﬁned ontologies in OWL DL , the description logic variant of the Web Ontol - ogy Language OWL ( W3C - Consortium 2003 ) . The follow - ing is a fragment of the rock genesis classiﬁcation ontol - ogy in the ontology repository for OMI , in which a class Metamorphic is deﬁned : . . . . . . < owl : Class rdf : ID = " Metamorphic " / > . . . . . . The ( chemical ) composition classiﬁcation ontology is de - ﬁned based on the genesis ontology . The following shows a fragment of the composition ontology : . . . . . . < owl : Ontology > < owl : imports rdf : resource = " http : / / www . geongrid . org / genesis " / > < / owl : Ontology > < owl : Class rdf : ID = " Marble " > < rdfs : subClassOf rdf : resource = " # Calcium " / > < rdfs : subClassOf rdf : resource = " http : / / www . geongrid . org / genesis # Metamorphic " / > < / owl : Class > . . . . . . A new class Marble is declared to be a subclass of the composition class Calcium and the genesis class Metamorphic . Additional ontologies for rock fabric and texture have been derived from a multi - hierarchical classiﬁ - cation scheme ( Struik et al . 2002 ) . In general , any web - accessible ontology having a URI can be imported and used by the system . If a user - deﬁned on - tology imports another ontology which is not in the system repository , the system will download the imported ontology and use the local copy whenever the remote ontology is not available . The system also provides a basic navigation tool to browse the ontologies in the system repository . Ontology Mappings Frequently a world can be modelled in several different ways . For instance , we have initially employed two different rock classiﬁcations , deﬁned separately by the British Geo - logical Survey ( Gillespie et al . 1999 ) and a Canadian work - ing group ( Struik et al . 2002 ) . Although these rock classiﬁ - cations have totally different class hierarchies , it is still pos - sible to deﬁne mappings which translate between classes and properties in one classiﬁcation and corresponding classes and properties in a second classiﬁcation . The mappings between ontologies provide the possibility of combining and parameterizing and switching ontologies , and they are very useful in practice . More research on ontology map - ping can be found in ( Kalfoglou & Schorlemmer 2002 ; Bench - Capon & Malcolm 1999 ; Sleeman et al . 2002 ) . In the following , we assume that all ontologies are formal - ized in the same logic , i . e . , we consider mappings between different ontologies ( not between different logics ) . An ontology mapping from an ontology O A to O B con - sists of a class mapping f and a property mapping g . The class mapping f is a partial function from the class set of O A to the set of all derived classes in O B , where a derived class is a class deﬁned from other classes , for example , an intersection of two other classes . The class mapping should preserve the subclass ( isa ) relation , i . e . , if A 1 and A 2 are classes in O A and A 1 is a subclass of A 2 , then f ( A 1 ) must be a subclass of f ( A 2 ) in O B : A 1 isa (cid:47) (cid:47) (cid:174) (cid:182) A 2 (cid:174) (cid:182) f ( A 1 ) isa (cid:47) (cid:47) f ( A 2 ) If f does not preserve the subclasses relation , then a query about individuals in f ( A 1 ) may incorrectly return some in - dividuals in f ( A 2 ) . The property mapping g is a partial mapping from the property set of O A to the set of all derived properties in O B , and should satisfy the following condition : If p is a prop - erty between the classes A 1 and A 2 in O A , then g ( p ) is a property between the classes f ( A 1 ) and f ( A 2 ) : A 1 p (cid:47) (cid:47) (cid:95) (cid:95) (cid:95) (cid:95) (cid:174) (cid:182) A 2 (cid:174) (cid:182) f ( A 1 ) g ( p ) (cid:47) (cid:47) (cid:95) (cid:95) (cid:95) f ( A 2 ) Note that a class mapping and a property mapping in - duce a natural translation from the constraints of O A to the constraints of O B . For instance , if O A has a con - straint | A | < 30 , i . e . , the cardinality of A is less than 30 , then this constraint can be translated into an O B constraint | f ( A ) | < 30 . An ontology mapping should satisfy the fol - lowing condition : if a constraint c a in O A can be naturally translated into a constraint c b in O B by its class mapping and property mapping , then c b is implied by O B . In other words , this condition says that an ontology mapping should not introduce any new constraints into the target ontology . In fact , the requirement that a class mapping should preserve the subclass relation is a special case of this condition . The validation of an ontology mapping can be done when its un - derlying logic is decidable , as is the case , for instance , for description logics ( Baader et al . 2003 ) . If there is an ontology mapping from O A to O B , then from any model M of O B , a submodel can be extracted and naturally transformed into a submodel of O A based on this ontology mapping . An ontology mapping is more general than a simple equivalence relation on classes and proper - ties . In fact , it deﬁnes a structural translation from one on - tology to another ontology . For example , let O A contain a class Person and a data property hasName and O B con - tain a class Employee and two data properties name and id , then a mapping sending Person to Employee and hasName to name is a valid general ontology mapping from O A to O B , so any model of O B can be naturally transformed into a model of O A via this mapping , that is , an employee is a person , but a person may be not an employee . In general , combining several ontologies can not be done by a simple union operation , because these ontologies may contain similar but different deﬁnitions for the same con - cept . For example , suppose ontology O A has a property p deﬁned between the classes A 1 and A 2 ( i . e . , A 1 p → A 2 ) and O B has a property q between B 1 and B 2 , and assume that A 1 and B 1 are conceptually the same . Combining O A and O B should give an ontology O containing a property p between a new concept A ( of O , representing A 1 and B 1 ) and A 2 , and a property q between A and B 2 . In OWL , this can be done by using equivalentClass or sameAs tags . Theoretically this result is equivalent to the pushout ( Barr & Wells 1990 ) of the following diagram : O (cid:48) ψ 1 (cid:47) (cid:47) ψ 2 (cid:178) (cid:178) O A (cid:178) (cid:178) (cid:194)(cid:194)(cid:194) O B (cid:47) (cid:47) (cid:95) (cid:95) (cid:95) O where O (cid:48) is an ontology containing only one class A . The ontology mapping ψ 1 sends A to A 1 , and ψ 2 sends A to B 1 . Note that parameterized ontologies and their instantiation can be implemented based on the same principle . A param - eterized ontology is a pair ( O (cid:48) , O A ) where the parameter on - tology O (cid:48) is included in the body ontology O A , which means that there is an inclusion ontology mapping from O (cid:48) to O A . To instantiate this parameterized ontology with an actual on - tology O B , an ontology mapping from the formal ontology O (cid:48) to O B must be provided . The instantiation result is the Figure 1 : OMI interface showing the integrated ontology and a web form allowing users to change ontology . pushout of the diagram above , i . e . , the ontology O in the diagram . It is unique up to ontological isomorphisms . Our system accepts ontology mappings in the form of OWL ﬁles . Currently , most axioms relating con - cepts between different ontologies simply use the equivalentClass tag . The following is a small fragment of an ad - hoc ontology mapping from the BGS rock classiﬁcation ( Gillespie et al . 1999 ) to the Canadian rock classiﬁcation ( Struik et al . 2002 ) : 1 . . . . . . < owl : Class rdf : about = " http : / / www . geongrid . org / br # FoidBearingMonzonite " > < owl : equivalentClass rdf : resource = " http : / / www . geongrid . org / composition # FoidMonzonite " / > < / owl : Class > . . . . . . Ontology mappings are used in navigation and query pro - cessing . If a data set is registered to an ontology O A , and there is an ontology mapping from O B to O A , then users can choose both , ontology O A and ontology O B to query the data set . In the example above , a user can use BGS rock classiﬁcation and / or the Canadian rock classiﬁcation to send their queries to the system . If an another data set is registered to the ontology O B , then the system that integrates two data sets still can use either ontology for accepting queries . Figure 1 shows how different ontologies can be selected using the simple forms - based interface of our current proto - type . 1 The current mapping is ad - hoc , since it has been based mainly on syntactic matches – in particular , our immediate purpose was not to achieve an actual domain - speciﬁc semantic reconcilation , but rather to illustrate the capabilities of OWL as a concept deﬁ - nition language . For a more rigorous mapping , domain scientists need to be consulted . Data Set Registration Each data set must be registered to an ontology before it is accessible from the system . In our current prototype only shapeﬁles ( ESRI 1998 ) are acceptable for registering . Each shapeﬁle consists of at least 3 ﬁles : shapefile . shp , shapefile . shx , and shapefile . dbf . The latter is the shapeﬁle’s feature attribute table stored in dBASE format . A shapeﬁle can contain only one table . The other two ﬁles ( shapefile . shp and shapefile . shx ) contain informa - tion about feature geometry . Our registration procedure takes the following 3 interac - tive steps to create the integration mapping from a shapeﬁle to some ontologies : 1 . Ontology Selection : The user is asked to select some class names from the OWL ontologies . Choosing a class name indicates that it might be able to ( virtually ) popu - late a corresponding class with instance object for each row based on some table columns . Such instance object can be considered as a value of a property of the polygon for this row . If a class is selected , its subclass are cal - culated and become automatically selected ( see example below ) . So , to classify the objects generated for all rows , it is sufﬁcient to choose one or several top level classes in the class hierarchy . The system can infer implied facts in the selected ontolo - gies . As a consequence , users can provide minimum in - formation to map their data into the ontologies . For exam - ple , suppose the classes A and B are two top level classes of two classiﬁcations : A B A 1 (cid:69) (cid:69) (cid:174)(cid:174)(cid:174)(cid:174)(cid:174)(cid:174) A 2 (cid:89) (cid:89) (cid:51)(cid:51)(cid:51)(cid:51)(cid:51)(cid:51) (cid:59) (cid:59) (cid:119)(cid:119)(cid:119)(cid:119)(cid:119)(cid:119)(cid:119)(cid:119)(cid:119)(cid:119) B 1 (cid:68) (cid:68) (cid:170)(cid:170)(cid:170)(cid:170)(cid:170)(cid:170) B 2 (cid:79) (cid:79) B 3 (cid:90) (cid:90) (cid:53)(cid:53)(cid:53)(cid:53)(cid:53)(cid:53) where an arrow represents an isa relation , i . e . a subclass relation . Consider a data provider who has data about ob - jects that belong to the class A , she will register her data relative to A or its subclasses A 1 and A 2 . Although A 2 is a subclass of B , it is sufﬁcient to choose A as the target class to map data , ignoring B . The system can automatically use the fact that A 2 is a subclass of B to answer queries like “ ﬁnd all instances of B ” . The of ontology constraints are important for the data reg - istration . For example , if the following constraint is de - clared : A 1 ∩ A 2 = ∅ A = A 1 ∪ A 2 which means A 1 and A 2 are disjoint subclasses of A , then it is illegal to populate A 1 and A 2 with instance objects from the same row . If we only have the constraint below : A = A 1 ∪ A 2 then each row of a table can generate instance objects of the class A 1 and A 2 at the same time . 2 . Mapping Data to Ontologies : For each selected class , the user is asked to choose one or several columns to ( vir - tually ) populate the class . If a single column is chosen and Figure 2 : OMI Interface showing the integrated geologic maps ( left ) , and ontology - aware query forms ( right ) . the data set contains classiﬁcation information , we found the following functions to be very useful in practice ( here , we chose general examples instead of geological ones , for clariﬁcation ) : ( a ) All Matches : If the name of a subclass of the target class is matched the value of the selected column , then assume an instance object of this subclass can be gen - erated . This method can be used for a column contain - ing multiple valid options , for example , “ student / housekeeper ” . ( b ) First Match : If there are multiple matches by using the All Matches method , then take the ﬁrst match to ( virtually ) create objects . This method can be used to select the begin point of an interval , for example , “ 1960 - 1970 ” . ( c ) Last Match : Similar to the First Match , this method takes the last match . This method ﬁt best if the column contains a sequence of narrowing down descriptions , for instance , “ java . util . Hashtable ” . ( d ) Manual Setting : The user decides the classes to create instance objects . The user can select one of these methods to populate the class . If multiple columns are selected , then the Manual Match method will be used to create ( virtual ) instances . If the selected class has some properties deﬁned on it , then for each property , the user is asked to select columns for populating it . 3 . Mismatch Resolution and Manual Setting : The system prompts this step when one of following two cases occurs : 1 ) The manual setting is selected in the second step ; 2 ) No match was found for some rows by the selected method other than the manual setting method in the second step . The user is then asked to select classes for these rows . Ontology - Aware Applications Any application that understands some ontologies in the sys - tem can be plugged into the system . There are two conﬁg - urable options to launch the application : entities in the on - tologies and data sets . Users can choose interesting concepts and data sets to start an application . The Ontology - enabled Map Integrator ( OMI ) As a part of the GEON , we try to build a system for inte - grating geologic maps from different geologic surveys . The objective is to integrate available geologic data sets to pro - vide a web - based interactive geologic map for ﬁnding the location where rock has a speciﬁed geologic age or compo - sition or fabric or texture or genesis property or any com - bination of these properties . The current prototype uses the open source MapServer ( University of Minnesota 2003 ) to implement the required standard GIS functions ; an integra - tion with ESRI’s commercial technology is planned as well . Five ontologies are submitted to the system : GeologicAge , Genesis , Texture , Fabric and Composition ( Struik et al . 2002 ) ( Harland et al . Figure 3 : Snapshot of two adjunct geologic map ( left ) , and some raw data ( right ) , obtained by selecting a point of interest . 1989 ) . All these ontologies represent the hierarchies of some classiﬁcations . The geologic age ontology can be simply described as the tree below : GeologicAge Cenozoic (cid:79) (cid:79) Measozoic (cid:104) (cid:104) (cid:81)(cid:81)(cid:81)(cid:81)(cid:81)(cid:81)(cid:81)(cid:81)(cid:81)(cid:81)(cid:81)(cid:81) . . . . . . Quaternary (cid:79) (cid:79) Tertiary (cid:97) (cid:97) (cid:68)(cid:68)(cid:68)(cid:68)(cid:68)(cid:68)(cid:68)(cid:68) Cretaceous (cid:79) (cid:79) Jurassic (cid:97) (cid:97) (cid:66)(cid:66)(cid:66)(cid:66)(cid:66)(cid:66)(cid:66)(cid:66) Triassic (cid:103) (cid:103) (cid:80)(cid:80)(cid:80)(cid:80)(cid:80)(cid:80)(cid:80)(cid:80)(cid:80)(cid:80)(cid:80)(cid:80) The other ontologies demonstrate the similar tree struc - tures . Furthermore , each subclass of composition or texture or fabric class may be a subclass of three genesis classes Igneous , Sedimentary and Metamorphic . The diagram below shows a part of composition classiﬁcation , which says that calcium and limestone rock is also sedimentary rock , whereas marble rock is also metamorphic rock . Composition Genesis . . . . . . (cid:79) (cid:79) Sedimentary (cid:58) (cid:58) (cid:117)(cid:117)(cid:117)(cid:117)(cid:117)(cid:117)(cid:117)(cid:117)(cid:117) Metamorphic (cid:79) (cid:79) Igneous (cid:98) (cid:98) (cid:70)(cid:70)(cid:70)(cid:70)(cid:70)(cid:70)(cid:70)(cid:70) Calcium (cid:79) (cid:79) . . . (cid:79) (cid:79) . . . (cid:79) (cid:79) . . . (cid:79) (cid:79) Limestone (cid:79) (cid:79) (cid:76) (cid:76) Marble (cid:100) (cid:100) (cid:74)(cid:74)(cid:74)(cid:74)(cid:74)(cid:74)(cid:74)(cid:74)(cid:74) (cid:76) (cid:76) Carbonitite (cid:106) (cid:106) (cid:84)(cid:84)(cid:84)(cid:84)(cid:84)(cid:84)(cid:84)(cid:84)(cid:84)(cid:84)(cid:84)(cid:84)(cid:84)(cid:84)(cid:84)(cid:84) (cid:77) (cid:77) In one of our test case , nine data sets are attached to the ontologies above ; they contain the rock age information in the states Arizona , Colorado , Idaho , Montana East , Mon - tana West , Nevada , New Mexico , Utah and Wyoming . Ad - ditionally Idaho and Montana West data sets also provide rock type information . The following is the table schema of Arizona data set : Arizona ( AREA , PERIMETER , AZ _ 1000 _ , AZ _ 1000 _ ID , GEO , PERIOD , ABBREV , DESCR , D _ SYMBOL , P _ SYMBOL ) where the column PERIOD gives geologic age information . No rock classiﬁcation information is provided . To register Arizona data set , we select GeologicAge class at the ﬁrst step , then select the column PERIOD and the All Matches method at the second step . The system scans the data in the column PERIOD and found two unmatched terms : Water and Algonkian , we choose Ignore to omit these rows . Other data sets have different schemas . For example , the Idaho data set has the following schema : Idaho ( AREA , PERIMETER , ID _ 500 _ , ID _ 500 _ ID , FORMATION , UNIT _ NAME , ROCK _ TYPE , ERA , SYSTEM , SERIES , LITH1 , LITH2 , LITH3 , LITH4 , LITH5 , LITH6 , LITH7 , LITH8 , LOCATION1 , LOCATION2 , COMMENTS , IDCARB , IDK , IDBASE , IDFAM , IDPHOS , IDSG , IDBATHAB , LITHA , LITH _ FORM , PERIOD , D _ SYMBOL , P _ SYMBOL , LITH _ MAJOR , LITH _ MINOR , LITHOLOGY , AGE , IDLITH ) Geologic ages can be found in the column AGE , whereas LITHOLOGY contains information about rock composition , texture , fabric and genesis . All these data sets are registered with the similar procedure as above . Figure 2 shows the interface of the application for auto - matic map integration , where the map is the result of query - ing rock with the age Mesozoic . If Info is chosen , click - ing on the map will return the raw data associated with the clicked polygon . Figure 3 shows the result after zooming in and selecting Info and clicking on a polygon . It took sev - eral days to integrate these data sets by hands before we built the system . With this data registration tool , a similar system for mid - atlantic area has been done in less than half a hour . The ontology RockAndSediment derived from BGS rock classiﬁcation and an ontology mapping from the RockAndSediment to the union of Genesis , Texture , Fabric and Composition are also submitted to the sys - tem . Then users are able to choose ontologies to send their queries . Conclusions An ontology based prototype for geologic map integration and its data set registration procedure have been discussed in this paper . The experiments we have done show that on - tology based approaches are promising for scientiﬁc data in - tegration and navigation . The novel design of the system makes it extremely easy to dynamically plug - in new data sets . Many problems are open for future research , for in - stance , what is the best way to organize the ontology and on - tology mapping repositories , and what kind of reasoning ser - vices over those ontologies and mappings are needed . Also we plan to extend our system to be able to register database tables as well as XML documents in the future , and make it part of a generic framework for semantic registration of scientiﬁc data ( Bowers & Lud¨ascher 2003 ) .
