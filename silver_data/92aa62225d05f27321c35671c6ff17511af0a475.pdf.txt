By 15 combining structural and molecular approaches , we define a new mechanism by which an 16 essential transcription factor ( TF ) targets co - transcriptional splicing through physical and 17 functional interaction with RNA and RNA binding proteins ( RBPs ) . We show that an essential 18 TF co - transcriptionally regulates sex - specific alternative splicing by directly interacting with a 19 subset of target RNAs on chromatin and modulating the dynamics of hnRNPA2 homolog nuclear 20 splicing condensates . 21 22 23 Main text ( 1500 words ) 24 25 Mechanisms to drive precise alternative splicing at thousands of genomic loci , which establish 26 sex and cell type - specific transcriptome diversity , remain important targets for biological 27 understanding because they establish sex and cell type - specific transcriptome diversity . 28 Chromatin - bound transcription factors ( TFs ) and RNA binding proteins ( RBPs ) co - 29 transcriptionally regulate alternative splicing 1 - 4 . However , the mechanisms by which TFs and 30 RBPs coordinate transcription and alternative splicing at specific genomic locations in a 31 2 particular cell type to drive specific alternative splicing events remain poorly understood . Most 32 TFs bind DNA and RNA 5 - 7 and interact with diverse RBPs 8 , 9 . Nevertheless , the mechanisms by 33 which interactions between TFs , RNA , and RBPs generate the specific alternatively spliced 34 transcripts essential for developmental decisions remain unknown . We hypothesize that TFs are 35 critical to targeting the correct co - transcriptional splicing events to specific genomic locations 36 due to their unique ability to bind chromatin , RNA , and spliceosomal RBPs . 37 38 We test this hypothesis by defining the role of GA - binding TF CLAMP ( chromatin - linked 39 adapter for MSL Proteins ) in targeting sex - specific splicing to the correct genomic locations on 40 chromatin in Drosophila . CLAMP has several properties that suggest that it could target sex - 41 specific alternative splicing events to chromatin : 1 ) CLAMP binds to specific GA - enriched DNA 42 motifs via its mapped DNA binding domain , and its binding sites differ in males and females 10 - 43 13 ; 2 ) CLAMP is a pioneer TF that regulates sex - specific splicing in embryos at genes where it 44 does not regulate transcription 14 ; 3 ) CLAMP is enriched at the intronic region of CLAMP - 45 dependent sex - specifically spliced genes 11 , 14 ; 4 ) CLAMP is associated with RBPs that are 46 spliceosome components 9 . 47 48 Here , we define direct CLAMP - RNA interactions and compare them to CLAMP - DNA 49 interactions to identify associations between TF - DNA and TF - RNA binding at genes where 50 CLAMP regulates sex - specific alternative splicing . Furthermore , we determine how CLAMP 51 affects the dynamics of RBPs , which are known to regulate alternative splicing as part of nuclear 52 splicing condensates . 53 54 To define RNA species that interact with CLAMP in different cellular compartments at high 55 resolution , we performed fractionation iCLIP ( i ndividual - nucleotide resolution C ross L inking 56 and I mmuno P recipitation ) to identify CLAMP RNA targets in chromatin ( ChF ) and 57 nucleoplasmic ( NF ) fractions of male ( S2 ) and female ( Kc ) Drosophila cell lines , S2 well 58 established cell lines for studying sex - specific processes such as dosage compensation 15 , 16 . 59 60 Most CLAMP interaction with RNA occurs on chromatin with unique sex - specific targets ( Fig 61 1A , Table 1a ) . Interestingly , CLAMP also directly interacts with spliceosomal RNAs sex - 62 3 specifically ( Fig 1B ) . In the male chromatin fraction , CLAMP interacts with the catalytic step 2 63 spliceosome consisting of U2 , U5 , and U6 snRNAs ( FDR : 1 . 7E - 3 ) . In contrast , the female 64 chromatin fraction is enriched for transcripts that encode proteins that bind to the U1 - U2 65 snRNAs ( FDR : 1 . 1E - 2 ) , suggesting that CLAMP regulates splicing differently in males and 66 females . 67 68 Next , we asked how the CLAMP interaction with DNA correlates with its interaction with RNA 69 on chromatin . Therefore , we plotted the frequency of identifying a CLAMP RNA binding peak 70 on chromatin over a region ±1 kb from the closest CLAMP DNA binding peak to define the 71 following categories : a ) complete overlap of RNA peaks with DNA peaks ; b ) partial overlap of 72 RNA peak with the ends of a DNA peak ; and c ) RNA peaks nearby ( ±1 kb ) DNA peaks ( Fig 1C , 73 Fig S1a - c ) . We found that most overlapping CLAMP RNA peaks are within 250 bp of the 74 middle of the nearest CLAMP DNA peak in both male and female cells ( Fig 1C ) , suggesting that 75 CLAMP links RNA to DNA during co - transcriptional splicing at a subset of its target genes ( Fig 76 1D - E ; Table 1b ) . 77 78 Next , we combined in vivo and in vitro approaches to define how CLAMP regulates alternative 79 splicing through interaction with RNA and RBPs . CLAMP does not have a canonical R NA 80 r ecognition m otif ( RRM ) but contains a prion - like domain ( PrLD ) , a subclass of intrinsically 81 disordered domains ( IDR ) that are enriched in polar residues and found in yeast prion proteins 82 ( Fig 1F - H ) . Many RBPs and TFs contain PrLD domains 17 , 18 that can promote RNA - binding and 83 drive the formation of phase - separated biomolecular condensates 19 . PrLD domains in TFs 84 promote co - aggregation with RBPs to regulate transcription 20 - 22 . However , mechanisms by 85 which the PrLD domains in TFs regulate alternative splicing remained unknown . 86 87 We define the role of CLAMP PrLD by generating complete ( CLAMP Δ 154 - 290a . a ) and partial 88 ( CLAMP Δ 160 - 290a . a ) PrLD deleted mutant fly lines using CRISPR / Cas9 genomic mutagenesis 89 and homologous repair 39 . Complete deletion of the PrLD ( CLAMP delPrLD ) results in embryonic 90 lethality . In contrast , partial deletion ( clamp delPrLD + 6Q ) mutants that retain a stretch of 6 91 glutamines survive , suggesting that these glutamines ( aa154 - 160 ) are essential for viability ( Fig 92 1H ) . Therefore , we assayed sex - specific alternative splicing in trans - heterozygous mutants 93 4 ( clamp delPrLD / clamp delPrLD + 6Q ) to assure viability until it is possible to define the sex of animals at 94 the larval stage . Analysis of RNA sequencing data using the time2splice pipeline ( Ray , Conard , 95 et al . , 2023 ) from trans - heterozygous mutants ( clamp delPrLD / clamp delPrLD + 6Q ) identifies CLAMP 96 PrLD - dependent female ( Table 2a ) and male - specific splicing ( Table 2b ) . Therefore , the 97 CLAMP PrLD is essential for viability and impacts sex - specific alternative splicing . 98 99 Next , we asked whether the PrLD domain regulates the CLAMP - RNA interaction using NMR 100 and RNA - Protein EMSAs ( Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays ) . Both assays demonstrated 101 that the PrLD domain in CLAMP promotes the interaction of CLAMP with RNA ( Fig 1I - J ) . 102 Using NMR spectroscopy to probe a mixture of total yeast RNA extract and the isolated CLAMP 103 PrLD , we find that CLAMP PrLD directly interacts with RNA ( Fig 1I ) . CLAMP is associated 104 with the Male Sex - lethal Complex ( MSL ) , which regulates dosage compensation in males and 105 contains the roX long non - coding RNAs 12 , 23 . However , it was not known whether CLAMP 106 directly interacts with the roX RNAs . Because the roX RNAs have a defined structure and 107 function 24 , we used roX2 , identified by iCLIP as an in vivo male - specific CLAMP interactor 108 ( Table 1a ) , to determine whether CLAMP directly interacts with RNA in vitro . Therefore , we 109 used a roX2 probe ( 411 nt ) for RNA - Protein EMSA gel shift assays with full - length CLAMP WT 110 and CLAMP delPrLD proteins that were expressed and purified from E . coli . At the same protein 111 and RNA concentrations , the CLAMP delPrLD protein binds to RNA less efficiently than 112 CLAMP WT ( Fig 1J ) . Furthermore , iCLIP data indicate that CLAMP binds to the roX2 RNA 113 adjacent ( 12nt downstream ) to a stem - loop region ( Fig S2 ) , which is essential for roX2 114 interaction with RNA helicase A , a component of both the MSL complex and the spliceosome 24 . 115 Therefore , we hypothesized that the roX2 stem loop promotes interaction with CLAMP . To test 116 this hypothesis , we also designed and tested the following roX2 mutant probes : a ) a full - length 117 probe lacking the stem - loop and CLAMP binding region ( 69nt ) , which reduced CLAMP binding 118 to the roX2 RNA ( Fig S2 , Fig 1K ) , and b ) a full - length probe lacking only the in vivo CLAMP 119 binding region ( 25nt ) but not the stem loop , which did not qualitatively affect CLAMP binding 120 to the roX2 RNA in vitro ( Fig S2 , Fig 1L ) . Therefore , the presence of the roX2 RNA stem - loop 121 and the CLAMP PrLD domain increased the ability of CLAMP to interact with RNA . 122 123 5 To determine whether the CLAMP PrLD domain regulates sex - specific alternative splicing of 124 RNAs that are directly bound by CLAMP ( Table 2a , b ) , we compared the RNAs bound to 125 CLAMP in vivo identified by iCLIP ( Table 1a ) in cell lines with CLAMP PrLD - dependent sex - 126 specifically spliced genes in L3 larvae ( Table 2a , b ) . We determined that 14 CLAMP PrLD - 127 dependent sex - specifically spliced genes are direct CLAMP RNA interactors , identifying a 128 smaller subset of key genes for further analysis ( Table 3 ) . Moreover , most of these 14 direct 129 targets are themselves regulators of alternative splicing ( Table 3 ) . Therefore , it is possible that 130 CLAMP , which is heavily maternally deposited 25 and regulates 60 % of all sex - specific spliced 131 isoforms , functions as an essential upstream splicing regulator by directly regulating the splicing 132 of splicing factors , which then regulates alternative splicing of additional target genes . 133 134 To define how CLAMP regulates sex - specific splicing beyond directly interacting with the RNA 135 of target genes , we determined how CLAMP regulates the splicing and dynamics of one of its 136 essential target genes and interactors , the hnRNPA2B1 orthologue , hrp38 . One of the 14 137 CLAMP PrLD - dependent spliced genes that is a direct CLAMP RNA target is the hrp38 138 transcript ( Table 2a , 3 ) . Furthermore , we previously demonstrated using proteomics that CLAMP 139 sex - specifically interacts with the Hrp38 protein that regulates alternative splicing 9 , 26 . 140 141 Due to the functional interaction between CLAMP and Hrp38 at both the RNA and protein 142 levels , we further defined how CLAMP regulates both the sex - specific splicing of the hrp38 143 transcript and the sex - specific dynamics of Hrp38 which is a component of highly mobile 144 nuclear splicing speckles which regulate alternative splicing 27 - 30 . First , we defined how CLAMP 145 interacts with hrp38 RNA using RNA EMSA . Integrating iCLIP with alternative splicing 146 analysis suggested that CLAMP binds to exon1 of the hrp38 transcript in males , which 147 undergoes splicing to remove exon2 . In contrast , in CLAMP delPrLD / CLAMP delPrLD + 6Q mutants , the 148 hrp38 transcript retains exon2 ( Fig 2A , B ) . Therefore , we compared CLAMP WT binding to hrp38 149 exon1 and exon2 probes using RNA EMSAs and found that at the same protein and RNA 150 concentrations , CLAMP binds strongly to hrp38 exon1 RNA with no unbound RNA remaining 151 ( Fig 2C ) . Furthermore , the PrLD domain of CLAMP is important for CLAMP - hrp38 RNA 152 binding ( Fig 2D ) . Interestingly , CLAMP WT still binds to hrp38 exon2 in vitro even though it does 153 6 not bind in vivo , suggesting that other RBPs modulate the specificity of CLAMP - RNA 154 interactions in vivo . 155 156 Next , we validated that the alternative splicing of the hrp38 gene is sex - specifically regulated by 157 the CLAMP PrLD domain in vivo during development at the third instar larval stage in males 158 and females . We found that in clamp delPrLD / clamp delPrLD + 6Q mutants , splicing of intron 159 AF : r6 : 3R : 28600568 : 28600718 : + between exon2 and exon4 ( Fig 2B ) is regulated by CLAMP as 160 predicted by genome - wide splicing analysis ( Table 2b ) . In both female and male mutants , 161 splicing of intron AF : r6 : 3R : 28600568 : 28600718 : + occurs However , in males , splicing was more 162 efficient than in females ( Fig 2E , F ) . Our in vivo splicing analysis demonstrates that the CLAMP 163 PrLD domain is important for hrp38 RNA splicing during male and female development . PrLD 164 domains can drive the phase separation of proteins 19 and promote the formation of subnuclear 165 bio - condensates involved in transcription 20 , 31 and splicing 19 , 32 , therefore , we performed 166 biochemical phase separation assays to determine how the CLAMP PrLD domain regulates the 167 phase separation behavior of CLAMP ( Fig 2G ) . We found that the CLAMP PrLD domain 168 contributes to phase separation of the N - terminal half of CLAMP ( residues 1 - 300 ) , which is 169 important because many RBPs involved in splicing form splicing condensates , and TFs form 170 transcription condensates , which interact during co - transcriptional splicing 33 . Although the PrLD 171 domains of TFs can promote co - aggregation with RBPs , current work does not yet explain how 172 TF - RBP interaction regulates the dynamics of splicing condensates , which is known to regulate 173 their function . 174 175 Interestingly , one splicing component that is part of dynamic nuclear splicing condensates or 176 speckles is Hrp38 27 - 30 , which is associated at three levels with CLAMP : 1 ) CLAMP interacts 177 with hrp38 RNA transcript ( Table 1a ) ; 2 ) CLAMP regulates alternative splicing of the hrp38 178 transcript , and 3 ) CLAMP interacts with Hrp38 protein 9 ( Fig . 1 ; Table 1a ) . Therefore , we 179 hypothesized that CLAMP PrLD - mediated phase separation affects the phase separation 180 properties of Hrp38 condensates . We tested our hypothesis by combining in vitro and in vivo 181 approaches to measure condensate formation , stability , and dynamics . In vitro , CLAMP 1 - 182 300 WT and Hrp38 co - phase - separate into liquid - like ( Fig 2H ) . To complement in vitro studies , 183 we analyzed the dynamics of Hrp38 nuclear speckles / condensates in vivo during development in 184 7 live tissues isolated from males and females . Therefore , we compared the dynamics of Hrp38 - 185 GFP nuclear speckles / condensates in the presence of CLAMP WT and CLAMP delPrLD proteins . 186 FRAP analysis shows that in both clamp delPrLD / clamp delPrLD + 6Q mutant male and female 187 individuals , Hrp38 remains in a more immobile phase compared with matched wild - type controls 188 ( Fig 2I ) . Next , we analyzed the trajectories of moving Hrp38 speckles over time to determine 189 whether CLAMP regulates their mobility . When we analyze trajectories of moving Hrp38 190 speckles over time , more restricted tracks denote more immobile fractions , while freely moving 191 particles represent mobile fractions 34 . Interestingly , we found that even in wild - type controls , 192 female Hrp38 speckles are more immobile than male Hrp38 speckles . Furthermore , in the 193 absence of the CLAMP PrLD domain , Hrp38 speckles in males become more immobile ( Fig 2J ) , 194 becoming more female - like . Therefore , the CLAMP PrLD domain regulates the dynamics of 195 Hrp38 speckles sex - specifically in live tissues , promoting their enhanced mobility in males . 196 197 Prior studies 35 - 38 suggest that larger aggregates of hnRNPs are more immobile and have 198 decreased function . In CLAMP delPrLD mutants , we observe bigger Hrp38 speckle size ( Fig 2K ) 199 and loss of mobility ( Fig 2I , J ) . We thus conclude that the CLAMP PrLD domain regulates 200 Hrp38 splicing condensate size and , therefore , is likely to modulate the ability of Hrp38 201 condensates to regulate alternative splicing . Furthermore , the PrLD domain in CLAMP promotes 202 CLAMP liquid droplet formation ( Fig 2G ) , which co - localizes with Hrp38 splicing condensates 203 ( Fig 2H ) . Hence CLAMP PrLD may help maintain Hrp38’s dynamic properties , preventing them 204 from forming large non - functional aggregates . Therefore , our data support a model in which sex - 205 specific differences in alternative splicing arise from differential TF - RBP and TF - RNA 206 interactions ( Fig . 1 ) . How the sex - specific differential interactions are established requires future 207 investigation . 208 209 Thus , we show for the first time that an intrinsically disordered domain ( IDR ) in a TF regulates 210 alternative splicing by regulating the dynamics of splicing condensates . Also , our data suggest 211 that TFs that bind to specific DNA motifs and have RNA binding properties are the best 212 candidates for understanding how specific alternative splicing events are regulated in specific 213 cellular contexts . 214 215 8 216 217 218 219 220 Methods : 221 222 Cell culture : Kc and S2 cells were maintained at 25°C in Schneider ' s media supplemented with 223 10 % Fetal Bovine Serum and 1 . 4X Antibiotic - Antimycotic ( Thermofisher Scientific , USA ) . 224 Cells were passaged every three days to maintain an appropriate cell density . 225 226 Fly strains and husbandry : Drosophila melanogaster fly stocks were maintained at 24°C on 227 standard corn flour sucrose media . Fly strains with complete ( CLAMP Δ 154 - 290a . a ) and partial 228 ( CLAMP Δ 160 - 290a . a ) PrLD deleted mutant fly lines using CRISPR / Cas9 genomic mutagenesis 229 and homologous repair 39 . We used the flyCRISPR Optimal Target Finder tool from the 230 University of Wisconsin to design a CRISPR target sequence for clamp delPrLD and 231 clamp delPrLD + 6Q39 . We cloned target sequence oligonucleotides ( one gRNA ) for clamp delPrLD 232 ( sense : 5 ' CTTCGGGTACAACGCCAAAGCGAG3 ' ; antisense : 3 ' CCCATGTTGCGGTTTCGCTC 233 - CAAA5 ' ) and two gRNAs for clamp delPrLD + 6Q ( sense : 5 ' CTTCG - 234 AATAGAATCGCCGCCCGCT3 ' ; antisense : 3 ' CTTATCTTAGCGGCGGGCGACAAA5 ' ) and ( se 235 nse : 5 ' CTTC - GTTGTGGCTGCACAGACTGG3 ' ; antisense : 3 ' CAACACCGACGTGTCTGACC - 236 CAAA5 ' ) into the pU6 - BbsI - chiRNA plasmid ( Addgene no . 45946 ) , following the protocol 237 outlined on the flyCRISPR website . We validated the correct ligation of the clamp CRISPR 238 target sequence into the pU6 - BbsI - chiRNA plasmid by Sanger sequencing using universal M13 239 primers . For homologous repair , we used 240 ssODN15 ' ACATAAGCTTTAAGTGTGACGTATGTTCAGATATGTTCCCTCATTTGGCAC 241 TTCTTAATGCTCATAGAGAGGCGAGCAGTGGGTCTGGCCATCATCCTGTGAAAAAAC 242 GAAATTCCCAGCAGATGACCAAAT3 ' for clamp delPrLD andssODN2 243 5 ' CTTCTTAATGCTCATAAGCGGATGCATACAGACGGGGAACAGCAGCAACAACAGC 244 AACATAACGCCCAAGCTGGCGGTACAACGCCAAAGCGAGAGGCGAGCAGTGGGTCT 245 GGCCATCATCCTGTGAAAAAA3 ' for clamp delPrLD + 6Q . The commercial service , BestGene 246 9 Inc . , microinjected the validated pU6 - BbsI - chiRNA plasmid containing the clamp target 247 sequence into germline - expressing Cas9 flies Bloomington stock # 51324 . Flies containing a 248 single mutation were returned balanced over the Curly of Oster ( CyO ) second chromosome 249 balancer . From these progenies , we identified the CRISPR / Cas9 - generated mutations by PCR 250 across the target region ( forward : 5 ′ - GATATGTTCCCTCATTTGGCAC - 3 ′ , reverse : 5 ′ - 251 CACTCCCATGCTTCACACAG - 3 ′ ) . We isolated two independent clamp alleles from this 252 validation : ( 1 ) y 1 , w 1118 ; clamp delPrLD / CyO ; and ( 2 ) y 1 , w 1118 ; clamp delPrLD + 6Q / CyO . These were 253 crossed to obtain male and female clamp delPrLD + 6Q / clamp delPrLD genotypes .

An equal 259 number of cells for each category were suspended in wash buffer and subjected to Cut & Run 260 assay according to Skene et al . 2018 40 using rabbit anti - CLAMP ( 5 µ g ) to immunoprecipitate 261 CLAMP bound DNA fragments from male ( S2 ) and female ( Kc ) cell lines . Three replicates for 262 males and females were run , but one female sample was dropped during later stages due to 263 insufficient starting material . Rabbit IgG was used as a control for each male and female cell line 264 sample . 1ng CUT & RUN DNA was used to generate libraries using the Kapa Hyper prep kit 265 ( Roche , USA ) and SeqCapAdapter Kit A ( Roche , USA ) . 14 PCR cycles were used to amplify the 266 libraries .

Data is 279 to be submitted to the GEO repository . 280 281 iCLIP : Cells were allowed to grow to confluency , and UV crosslinked using 254 nm UV light in 282 Stratalinker 2400 on ice ( Stratagene , USA ) . UV - treated cells were lysed to get different cellular 283 fractions ( Cytoplasmic , Nucleoplasmic , and Chromatin ) according to the Fr - iCLIP 284 ( fractionation - iCLIP ) protocol from Brugiolo et al 2017 42 . Chromatin and nucleoplasmic 285 fractions were sonicated with a Branson digital sonicator at 30 % amplitude for 30 seconds ( 10 286 sec on and 20 sec off ) to disrupt DNA before IP . All three fractions were separately centrifuged 287 at 20 , 000 xg for 5 min at 4 ℃ . Fractions were tested by Western blotting using RNApolI for 288 Chromatin Fraction and Actin for Cytoplasmic Fraction . Protein quantification for each fraction 289 was done using the manufacturer’s protocol for Pierce 660 nm protein assay reagent ( Thermo 290 Scientific , USA ) .

Heyl et al . 2020 42 methods using the Galaxy CLIP - Explorer were followed to 297 preprocess , perform quality control , post - process , and peak calling . 298 299 300 Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) : 301 In vivo ( Malphighian tubule principle cell nucleus expressing Hrp38GFP in control and 302 clamp delPrLD + 6Q / clamp delPrLD male and female third instar larvae ) FRAP was performed on a 303 Nikhon Spin - disc Confocal Microscope with a 488 nm laser on a 60 × objective taking frames 304 without delay ( short time course and fast - recovering control ) with 3 - sec acquisition pre - 305 bleaching , bleaching using 473 nm laser at 100 % and2 minutes acquisition post - bleach . 306 Malphighian tubules ( MTs ) were dissected in Grace’s Insect media with 1 : 50 dilution of 307 ProlongLive ( antifading agent ) . A 6 % slurry of low melting agarose ( A9414 - 5G ) in Grace’s 308 11 Insect media was used to stabilize the MTs during imaging on a bridge slide with a cavity to pour 309 the agarose , which was allowed to solidify , forming a soft base to mount the tissue . The 310 intensities recorded on selected regions of interest were obtained using NIS element software . 311 Data fitting and immobile fraction analysis were obtained with NIS element software FRAP 312 analysis module . 313 314 In - vivo live imaging : Salivary gland expressing Hrp38GFP ( nuclear ) in control and 315 clamp delPrLD + 6Q / clamp delPrLD male and female third instar larvae were dissected in Grace’s Insect 316 media with 1 : 50 dilution of ProlongLive ( antifading agent ) and mounted in the dissecting media 317 on a bridge slide with low melting agarose ( A9414 - 5G ) in Grace’s Insect media as a base . 318 Moving Hrp38GFP condensates in the nucleus were imaged using a 488 nm laser on Nikon 319 Spin - disc Confocal Microscope at 60X magnification for 2 minutes each without any delay in 320 acquisition . 321 322 Validation of hrp38 splicing using RT - PCR assay : Total RNA was extracted from 5 third 323 instar larvae ( L3 ) female and male embryos expressing clamp delPrLD + 6Q / clamp delPrLD and y 1 , w 1118 . 324 Following the manufacturer ' s protocol , we reverse - transcribed one microgram of total RNA 325 using the SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit ( Life Technologies , USA ) . We amplified target 326 sequences by PCR using primers designed to span alternatively spliced junctions ( FP - 327 5’AGAACGGCAACTCCAATGGC3’ and RP - 5’GCCAGTCTCCTTGTCAATGA3’ ) and Quick 328 load Taq 2X Master mix ( # M0271L , NEB , USA ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol ( 28 329 cycles ) . 10ul of PCR product of each replicate for each gene was loaded in separate wells in 2 % 330 agarose gels and imaged using a ChemiDoc TM MP Imaging system ( BioRad , USA ) . All 331 replicates for each gene were loaded on the same gel . The gel images were quantified using the 332 densitometry steps with the Fiji image analysis tool . Student’s t - tests were performed to 333 determine significant differences between groups ( two samples at a time ) . Three replicates for 334 RT - PCR samples were performed . 335 336 CLAMP Protein Expression and Purification : Vectors encoding Maltose binding protein 337 ( MBP ) - tagged CLAMP 1 - 300 and MBP - tagged CLAMP 1 - 300 delPrLD were produced by 338 cloning into the pTHMT vector . Plasmids were transformed into BL21 cells and bacteria cultures 339 12 were grown in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 15 N ammonium chloride . Cultures were 340 grown at 37°C and 200 RPM to an optical density of 0 . 6 - 0 . 8 and subsequently induced with 1 341 mM isopropyl - β - D - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside ( IPTG ) for 4 hr at 37°C . Cell pellets were harvested 342 by centrifugation at 6 , 000 RPM , resuspended in lysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH 8 , 1 M NaCl , 10 343 mM Imidazole , 1 mM DTT , and one EDTA - free protease inhibitor tablet ( Roche ) per liter of 344 culture ) , and lysed by sonication . The lysed cell suspension was centrifuged at 20 , 000 RPM for 345 50 min . The supernatant was filtered using a 0 . 2 µm syringe filter , and loaded onto a HisTrap HP 346 5 ml column . The HisTrap column was first washed with 20 mM Tris pH 8 , 1 M NaCl , 10 mM 347 Imidazole , 1 mM DTT Buffer , and then the bound protein was eluted with 20 mM Tris pH 8 , 1 348 M NaCl , 500 mM Imidazole , 1 mM DTT buffer . Fractions containing MBP - CLAMP 1 - 300 were 349 collected and purified on a Superdex 200 ( 26 / 600 ) column equilibrated in 20 mM Tris pH 8 , 1 . 0 350 M NaCl buffer . CLAMP PrLD ( 154 - 290 ) was expressed and purified using Histrap HP as above . 351 Following that ( instead of size exclusion chromatography ) , CLAMP PrLD was collected from 352 the Histrap HP , concentrated to 1 mL , and cleaved overnight with TEV protease to separate 353 CLAMP PrLD from the MBP in 20 mM Tris pH 8 , 1 M NaCl , 10 mM Imidazole , and 1 mM 354 DTT Buffer . The cleaved protein was separated from the HisTag by a HisTrap subtraction with 355 the same Tris buffer previously described . MBP - tagged Full - Length CLAMP was grown 356 following the same methods above . Once the Full - Length CLAMP cell lysate supernatant was 357 loaded onto HisTrap HP 5 ml column , the protein was eluted with a gradient from 10 to 500 mM 358 imidazole in pH 5 . 5 20 mM MES and 361 mM CaCl 2 . Fractions containing MBP - CLAMP FL 359 were collected and purified on a Superdex 200 ( 26 / 600 ) column equilibrated in pH 5 . 5 , 20mM 360 MES , and 361mM CaCl2 buffer . For each CLAMP construct , fractions containing the desired 361 protein were verified using SDS - PAGE , concentrated using a 10 kDa centrifugation filter 362 ( Millipore ) , aliquoted , and frozen . 363 364 Hrp38 protein purification and phase separation assay : Maltose binding protein ( MBP ) - 365 tagged Hrp38 was expressed in BL21 E . coli cells . The cells were resuspended in 20 mM NaPi at 366 pH 7 . 4 with 300 mM NaCl and 10 mM imidazole , and the lysate was cleared by centrifuging at 367 20 , 000 rpm for 60 mins at 4 o C . The supernatant was filtered using 0 . 2 µ M filters and loaded on 368 a 5 ml Histrap HP column . The protein was eluted using an imidazole gradient of 10 - 300 mM 369 over 5 - column volumes . The protein fractions were pooled and loaded on a Superdex 200 370 13 ( 26 / 600 ) column for size exclusion . 20 mM NaPi with 300 mMNaCl at pH 7 . 4 was used for size 371 exclusion chromotography and storage . Protein was flash frozen as aliquots of 1 mM . 372 Fluorescent labeling of the CLAMP 1 - 300 and CLAMP 1 - 300 dPrLD was done using 373 AlexaFluor 488 maleimide dye , while Hrp38 was labeled using 555 maleimide . The protein was 374 diluted to 100 µ M in 20 mM Tris buffer at pH 7 . 4 with 50 mMNaCl , and a 5 - fold concentration 375 ( 500 µ M ) of the dye dissolved in DMSO was added to 5 % of the total volume . The reaction 376 mixture was incubated for 1 hour , and then , unbound AlexaFluor was removed using 1 ml Zeba 377 spin desalting columns . The proteins were concentrated to 1 mM , flash frozen , and stored . For 378 phase separation assay and microscopy Hrp38 was buffer exchanged to 20 mM Tris buffer at pH 379 7 . 4 with 50 mM NaCl to a final concentration of 20 µ M . We calculated all concentrations on 380 NanoDrop by using the extinction coefficient 130 , 000 M - 1 cm - 1 for Hrp38 and 78270 for MBP 381 CLAMP 1 - 300 and MBP CLAMP 1 - 300 dPrLD . 1 uM of AlexaFluor labeled CLAMP was 382 added to Hrp38 and TEV protease was added to cleave the MBP tag . Less than 1 % fluorescent 383 protein was used in all samples . A Nikon spin - disc confocal microscope was used for imaging at 384 20X magnification with 1 . 5X zoom . The images were processed using ImageJ . 385 386 NMR Sample Preparation and Spectroscopy : 15 N Isotopically labeled samples of CLAMP 1 - 387 300 were prepared at 50 µ M in a buffer containing 20 mM MES pH 5 . 5 , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM 388 DTT , and 5 % D 2 O and then moved into a 5 mm NMR tube using a glass pipette . CLAMP 389 concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 280 nm ( and then dividing absorbance 390 by the extinction coefficient estimated by the Expasy ProtParam ) . NMR spectra were recorded 391 on Bruker Avance 850 MHz 1 H Larmor frequency spectrometer with HCN TCI z - gradient 392 cryoprobes . A two - dimensional 1 H 15 N HSQC was acquired using spectral widths of 10 . 5 ppm 393 and 30 . 0 ppm in the direct and indirect dimensions , with 3072 and 512 total points and 394 acquisition time of 172 ms and 99 . 0 ms , respectively . Samples of isotopically labeled CLAMP 395 PrLD were prepared at 20 µ M in a buffer containing 50 mM MES pH 5 , and 5 % D 2 O . Because 396 the PrLD domain of CLAMP contains no tyrosines or tryptophans , the A 280 absorbance could not 397 be measured to determine the protein concentration . Instead , sample concentration was estimated 398 by measuring the absorbance at 230 nm , and calculating the extinction coefficient to be 300 M - 399 1 cm - 1 per peptide bond ( 40 . 5 mM - 1 cm - 1 for CLAMP PrLD ) . Torula yeast was added to one PrLD 400 sample at a 1 : 1 Protein to RNA ratio by weight and NMR spectra were acquired in 5 mm NMR 401 14 tubes on a Bruker Avance 850 MHz 1 H Larmor frequency spectrometer . Both two - dimensional 402 1 H 15 N HSQC were acquired using spectral widths of 14 . 0 ppm and 25 . 0 ppm in the direct and 403 indirect dimensions , with 2048 and 256 total points and acquisition time of 86 . 0 ms and 59 . 4 ms , 404 respectively . All data was processed and analyzed using NMRPipe and CCPNMR Analysis 2 . 5 405 software 50 , 51 . 406 407 RNA Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays : rox2 RNA probes at 100 nM and hrp38 RNA 408 probes at 50nM were incubated with MBP - tagged FL CLAMP WT protein or MBP - tagged FL 409 CLAMP delPrLD protein in REMSA binding buffer provided with the LightShift Chemiluminescent 410 RNA EMSA kit ( Thermo Scientific , USA ) at room temperature for 30 min according to 411 manufacturer’s protocol . Reactions were loaded onto 6 % TBE retardation gels ( Thermo Fisher 412 Scientific ) and run in 0 . 5 × Tris – borate – EDTA buffer for one hour . RNA - Protein complex was 413 transferred to the Nylon membrane using the iBlot transfer system ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) , 414 and the probe signal was detected using a Chemiluminescent Nucleic acid detection module 415 ( # 80880 , ThermoFisher Scientific ) . 416 417 418 Computational Methods 419 CUT & RUN Data analysis : Sequenced reads were run through FASTQC 43 ( fastqc 420 replicate _ R1 _ 001 . fastq . gz replicate _ R2 _ 001 . fastq . gz ) with default parameters to check the 421 quality of raw sequence data and filter out any sequences flagged for poor quality . Sequences 422 were trimmed and reassessed for quality using TrimGalore 423 ( https : / / github . com / FelixKrueger / TrimGalore / issues / 25 ) and FastQC 43 , respectively . All Illumina 424 lanes of the same flow cell . fastq files were merged , and sequenced reads were mapped to release 425 6 Drosophila melanogaster genome ( dm6 ) . We compared Bowtie2 44 , HISAT2 45 , and BWA 46 . 426 We found the best alignment quality with BWA and thus used this method’s results downstream . 427 Next , we performed conversion to bam and sorting ( e . g . , using : bowtie2 - x dm6 _ genome - 1 428 replicate _ R1 _ 001 . fastq . gz - 2 replicate _ R2 _ 001 . fastq . gz - S out . sam > stout . txt 2 > 429 alignment _ info . txt ; samtools view - bSout . sam > out . bam ; rm - rfout . sam ; samtools sort out . bam - o 430 out . sorted . bam ) . We removed reads ( using samtools ) with a MAPQ less than 30 and any reads 431 with PCR duplicate reads ( identified using MarkDuplicates Picard - 2 . 20 . 2 ) . Peaks identified 432 15 using MACS2 47 ( macs2 callpeak - t out . sorted . bam - B - f BAM - - nomodel - - SPMR - - keep - dup all 433 - g dm - - trackline - n outname - - cutoff - analysis - - call - summits - p 0 . 01 - - outdiroutdir ) and keep 434 duplicates separate . To calculate fold - enrichment macs2 is rerun ( macs2 bdgcmp - t $ treat - c 435 $ control - o $ out . sorted . bam _ FE . bdg - m FE 2 > $ out . sorted . bam _ FE . log ; macs2 bdgcmp - t $ treat 436 - c $ control - o $ out . sorted . bam _ logLR . bdg - m logLR - p 0 . 00001 2 ) . For motif analysis , the 437 MEME 48 suite was used . Data was submitted to the GEO repository ( # GSE174781 , 438 # GSE220981 and # GSE220053 ) . 439 440 iCLIP Data analysis : The method from Heyl et al . 2020 42 using the Galaxy CLIP - Explorer was 441 followed to preprocess , perform quality control , post - process and perform peak calling . UMI 442 tools were used for preprocessing , and then UMI tools and Cutadapt were used for Adapter , 443 Barcode , and UMI removal . Cutadapt ( Galaxy version 3 . 5 ) was used for filtering with a custom 444 adaptersequenceAGATCGGAAGAGCGGTTCAGCAGGAATGCCGAGACCGATCTCGTAT 445 GCCGTCTTCTGCTTG . All other settings followed the Heyl et al . 2020 Galaxy iCLIP - explorer 446 workflow . UMI - Tools Extract ( Galaxy Version 1 . 1 . 2 + galaxy2 ) was then used with a barcode 447 pattern of NNNXXXXNN . No unpaired reads were allowed . The barcode was on the 3 ' end . Je - 448 Demultiplex ( Galaxy Version 1 . 2 . 1 ) was then used for demultiplexing . FastQC was used for 449 quality control . Mapping was done by RNA STAR ( Galaxy version 2 . 5 . 2b - 2 ) using dm6 . All 450 settings were chosen based on the existing parameters from the iCLIP - explorer settings . We 451 selected FALSE for the option to use end - to - end read alignments with no soft - clipping . bedtools 452 used for Read - Filtering , and UMI - Tools ( Galaxy version 0 . 5 . 3 . 0 ) for de - duplication . PEAKachu 453 was used for Peak Calling to generate bed files . The PEAKachu settings were followed using the 454 Galaxy CLIP - explorer workflow . The maximum insert size was set to 150 , the minimum cluster 455 expression fraction was set to 0 . 01 , the minimum block overlap was set to 0 . 5 , and the minimum 456 block expression was set to 0 . 1 . The Mad Multiplier was set to 0 . 0 , the Fold Change Threshold 457 was set to 2 . 0 , and the adjusted p - value threshold was set to 0 . 05 . Peaks were annotated using 458 RCAS 49 ( RNA Centric Annotation System ) , an R package using Rstudio . MEME Suite is used 459 for motif detection . RCAS was used for functional analysis of the transcriptomes isolated by 460 iCLIP , such as transcript features . Data was submitted to the GEO repository ( # GSE205987 ) . 461 462 16 Integrating CUT & RUN and iCLIP data : A Python script was created that iterates through all 463 of the DNA peak bed files for CLAMP DNA binding sites in Kc and S2 cell lines ( CUT & RUN 464 data , # GSE220053 ) as a reference and tests for overlap with CLAMP - bound RNA peaks ( each 465 sequence is between 25 - 50bp in size ) in the Kc and S2 ( iCLIP data , ( # GSE205987 ) . The 466 overlaps are categorized into four main categories based upon the location of the overlap : 1 ) 467 completely overlapping ( purple lines in frequency plot ) , 2 ) partially overlapping at the DNA 468 peak start site ( red lines in frequency plot ) ; 3 ) partially overlapping at the DNA peak end site 469 ( blue lines in frequency plot ) and 4 ) non - overlapping , i . e . , when there is an overlap in a region 470 outside the DNA binding site ( yellow lines in frequency plot ) . This extended region is defined by 471 the scope variable in the script , allowing the overlap to look for binding sites near the DNA 472 binding site ( this scope is 2 kb , including the DNA binding site ) . We note that multiple RNA 473 peaks can be found on one DNA peak . These overlaps are placed onto a [ - scope , scope ] region . 474 Then , each type of overlap shown with a different color is overlaid and plotted onto a frequency 475 plot . So , if the frequency at a given base pair is 5 , five overlaps contain that base pair within the 476 region defined by the scope . 477 478 Analysis of Imaging data : Live - image 2 minutes movies acquired through confocal microscopy 479 were pre - processed using Fiji ( ImageJ ) Jython macro script , involving Fiji Plugins and built - in 480 software on the Hrp38 condensate ( green channel ) to distinguish Hrp38 phase condensates from 481 the cell background . Simple Ratio bleach correction was applied , and the minimum and 482 maximum intensity adjustment was executed based on the mean intensity and standard deviation 483 of intensity . The specific adjustment method varied depending on the image quality , ensuring 484 optimal visibility of Hrp38 condensate speckles . Then , background subtraction was performed 485 with a rolling ball radius of 120 pixels . The conversion to a binary image involved max entropy 486 thresholding , although the minimum thresholding method was employed for some images to 487 accommodate diverse lighting conditions . The thresholded images were saved as TIFF files for 488 use in the TrackIt tracking software . In total , 15 male control movies , 28 male CLAMP del PrLD 489 mutant movies , 15 female control movies , and 38 female CLAMP del PrLD movies were utilized 490 in subsequent analyses . 491 492 17 For tracking analysis , TIFF movies from each experimental condition were loaded into TrackIt 34 , 493 a program for tracking and analyzing single - molecule experiments developed by the Gebhardt 494 lab . The analysis was conducted using MATLAB on a Windows 10 PC , utilizing default settings 495 with specific parameter adjustments : threshold ( 4 ) , tracking radius ( 8 ) , minimum track length 496 ( 2 ) , one gap frame allowed , and minimum track length before the gap ( 3 ) . Each experimental 497 condition was analyzed using TrackIt ' s MATLAB - based data visualization tool , with settings 498 further edited for formatting in a MATLAB script . 499 500 Bound fraction analysis was done according to TrackIt package 34 . TrackIt provided information 501 on tracked events , including long , short , linked , and nonlinked events . The calculation of bound 502 fractions by TrackIt involved determining the ratio of the sum of short and long events to non - 503 linked events . Movie - wise means were plotted , and the mean across all movies and the pooled 504 fraction ( sum over all movies for each type of event ) were plotted to ensure that one movie did 505 not unduly influence the mean . 506 507 Competing Interest Statement 508 The authors declare no conflicting interests . 509 510 Acknowledgments 511 This work was supported by R35GM126994 to E .
