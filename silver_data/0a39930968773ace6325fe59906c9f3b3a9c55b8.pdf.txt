This study examined cognitive demands imposed on working memory by different types of instruction to speak with maximum pitch variation : visual analogy , verbal analogy and explicit verbal instruction . Method : Forty participants were asked to memorise a set of 16 visual and verbal stimuli while reading aloud a Cantonese paragraph with maximum pitch variation . Instructions about how to achieve maximum pitch variation were presented via visual analogy , verbal analogy , explicit rules or no instruction . Pitch variation was assessed off - line , using standard deviation of fundamental frequency . Immediately after reading , participants recalled as many stimuli as possible . Result : Analogy instructions resulted in significantly increased pitch variation compared to explicit instructions or no instructions . Explicit instructions resulted in poorest recall of stimuli . Visual analogy instructions resulted in significantly poorer recall of visual stimuli than verbal stimuli . Conclusion : The findings suggest that non - propositional instructions presented via analogy may be less cognitively demanding than instructions that are presented explicitly . Processing analogy instructions that are presented as a visual representation is likely to load primarily visuospatial components of working memory rather than phonological components . The findings are discussed with reference to speech therapy and human cognition . Keywords : Analogy instruction , speech motor task , visuospatial sketchpad , phonological loop Introduction Often information that can facilitate learning is presented by the coach , therapist or clinician as explicit , verbal instructions . The ability of a learner to follow the instructions is a function of their ability to memorise the information and use it during attempts to learn . The neuropsychological frame - work for this ability is often is conceptualised as working memory ( e . g . Miller , Galanter , & Pribram , 1960 ; Baddeley , 1995 ; Baddeley & Hitch , 1974 ) . Working memory is considered to be a process of the brain that provides temporary storage and manipula - tion of the information necessary for complex cogni - tive tasks , such as language , comprehension , learning and reasoning . Three sub - components of working memory are proposed , including a visuospatial sketchpad that handles visual and spatial information ; a phonological loop that handles speech - based and auditory information and a central executive that coordinates attention to the information in the different components ( Baddeley , 1995 ; 2003 ; 2012 ) . A significant limitation of working memory is that it has a limited capacity to hold information ( Cowan , Fristoe , Elliot , Brunner , & Saults , 2006 ; Engle & Kane , 2004 ) . The central executive , therefore , regu - lates distribution of attentional resources to different levels of a task ( allocation ) , switches attentional priorities ( updating ) and blocks irrelevant information ( inhibition ) ( Montgomery , Magimairaj , & Finney , 2010 ) . A more recent model proposed by Miyake and Friedman ( 2012 ) stated that the central executive focuses on constant monitoring and rapid modifica - tion of working memory information ( updating ) , switching flexibility between tasks and mental sets ( shifting ) and overriding dominant responses ( inhib - ition ) . Regardless of which model is more Correspondence : Dr Choi Yeung Andy , TSE , Doctor of Philosophy , Institute of Education , Hong Kong , Department of Health and Physical Education , Rm D4 - 2 / F - 03 , Block D4 , 10 Lo Ping Road , Tai Po , N .

The limitations of working memory are often noticeable during motor learning , as is self - evident when a learner - driver loses track of the road rules when paying attention in heavy traffic . To reduce the information load on working memory during motor learning , it has been suggested that instructional information can be presented in a non - propositional manner , rather than explicitly ( e . g . Masters & Poolton , 2012 ) . Analogies , for example , have been used to aid learning of a new concept , by relating it to a fundamentally similar concept , without neces - sity for explicit instruction ( Gentner , 1988 ; Gentner , Anggoro , & Klibanoff , 2011 ; Newton & Newton 1995 ; Schustack & Anderson , 1979 ) . Typically , motor analogy learning has been shown to produce performance that is less likely to be disrupted in cognitively demanding conditions that overload working memory , such as psychological stress or multi - tasking ( e . g . Lam , Maxwell , & Masters , 2009 ; Liao & Masters , 2001 ; Orrell , Eves , & Masters , 2006 ) . Liao and Masters ( 2001 ) , for instance , showed that learners who were instructed how to impart top - spin to a table tennis forehand shot via an analogy ( i . e . move the bat up the hypotenuse of a right - angle triangle ) displayed stable performance under a labora - tory stressor , compared to learners who were instructed via explicit rules ( e . g . keep the wrist firm , complete the swing with the racquet above the ball ) . Liao and Masters ( 2001 ) speculated that analogy instructions present information about the complex rule structures underlying the to - be - learned skill in a form that requires less conscious processing than verbal propositions ( see also Masters , 2000 ; Masters & Liao , 2003 ) . The benefits of analogy learning appears in the speech motor domain . Tse , Masters , Whitehill , and Ma ( 2012 ) , for instance , examined the effect of a ‘waves at sea’ analogy on pitch variation ( i . e . intonation ) during speech . Pitch variation is a universal feature of speech that is shared by lan - guages of different origins . Participants instructed via analogy achieved better control of their pitch variation than participants instructed explicitly . Importantly , Tse et al . ( 2014 ) showed that analogy instucted speech remained more stable under psy - chological stress than explicitly instructed speech , suggesting that the cognitive demands of analogy instructions may be lower . In most of these studies , however , the analogy instructions have been presented verbally ( i . e . described in words ) . Although the analogies undoubt - edly are visual , it is unclear whether they can be considered to be truly non - propositional ( see Liao & Masters , 2001 , for the same concern ) . Researchers ( e . g . Dagher , 1995 ; Donnelly & McDaniel , 1993 ; Schwartz , 1993 ) have reported that verbal and visual presentation modes have a differential impact on understanding of the conceptual information intrinsic to the analogy . For example , Orgill and Bodner ( 2004 ) found that people were better able to mem - orise a visual analogy instruction than a verbal analogy instruction and Mayer and Gallini ( 1990 ) showed that recall of conceptual information and the ability to infer its meaning , benefitted from incorporating a visual representation in a verbal analogy instruction , compared to a verbal analogy instruction alone . The objective of the present study was , therefore , to examine the effect of a verbal analogy , a visual analogy , explicit instructions and no instructions on pitch variation during a speech task . The second objective was to determine if the different forms of analogy place a differential load on ( a ) the visuo - spatial sketchpad , a component of working memory that serves to store visual and kinesthetic informa - tion , or ( b ) the phonological loop , a component that stores verbal and acoustic information ( Baddeley , 2003 ; Baddeley & Hitch , 1974 ) . We assessed pitch variation off - line by calculating standard deviation of fundamental frequency ( SDF 0 ) , a commonly used assessment of pitch variation ( Baudonck , D’haeseleer , Dhooge , & Van Lierde , 2011 ) and estimate of within - participant variability , which we subsequently converted to semitone units ( a loga - rithmic scale of pitch variation ) . Following a baseline read - aloud task , participants were instructed to memorise a random sequence of eight visual stimuli and eight verbal stimuli . Immediately after the stimuli were presented , partici - pants completed a second reading task in which they were instructed how to speak with maximum pitch variation via either ( 1 ) an analogy of a ‘‘choppy’’ sea that was presented verbally , ( 2 ) the same analogy presented visually , ( 3 ) explicit instructions about how to speak with maximum pitch variation or ( 4 ) no instructions . Based on the superior speech perform - ance of analogy instructed participants in our previ - ous study ( Tse et al . , 2013 ) , it was hypothesised that analogy instructions , regardless of visual or verbal form , would be more effective ( i . e . elicit increased pitch variation ) than explicit instructions or no instructions . It was hypothesised , however , that pro - cessing visual analogy information would depend upon primarily the visuospatial sketchpad , so recall of previously seen visual stimuli would be disrupted ; whereas , processing verbal analogy information or explicit instructions would depend upon primarily the phonological loop , so recall of previously seen verbal stimuli would be disrupted . Method Participants Forty healthy native Cantonese speakers ( 20 males , 20 females : mean age ¼ 20 . 47 years , SD ¼ 1 . 41 ) were recruited from the University of Hong Kong . 2 C . Y . Andy et al . D o w n l o a d e d by [ N e w Y o r k U n i v e r s it y ] a t 02 : 18 10 M a r c h 2016 The inclusion criteria were : ( 1 ) no history or presence of vision deficits or voice , speech or hearing impairments ; ( 2 ) no formal public speech or singing training ; and ( 3 ) total number of correct responses in the Digit Span Test ( Wechsler , 1945 ) equal to or more than 12 out of 16 ( mean ¼ 14 . 37 , SD ¼ 0 . 75 ) . Mean baseline reading SDF 0 of males ( mean SDF 0 ¼ 27 . 51 Hz ) and females ( mean SDF 0 ¼ 21 . 34 Hz ) was comparable to previous work ( Tse et al . , 2012 ) . Participants were allocated randomly to a visual analogy instruction group , a verbal analogy instruction group , an explicit instruc - tion group or an uninstructed control group . Apparatus and procedures Speech samples were recorded by a microphone ( Model : Shure Beta 58A ) positioned 6 cm from the participant’s mouth corner . The microphone was connected to a computer ( Model : Dell 2410 desk - top ) via an external soundcard ( Model : M - audio Mobile PreUSB ) in a sound attenuated room , with background noise less than 42 . 23 dBA . Using the classification scheme of the National Centre for Voice and Speech ( Titze , 1995 ) , all speech samples were categorised as Type 1 with periodic voice patterns displayed in the phonetic software of Praat ( version : 5 . 3 . 04 , Boersma & Weenink , 2012 ) . A standardised Cantonese passage North Wind and the Sun ( International Phonetics Association , 1999 ) , which is commonly used in speech research , was used . The passage was divided into three paragraphs , each of which consisted of 51 Chinese characters . The paragraphs were counterbalanced across partici - pants to minimise possible order effects . The study comprised baseline reading , memorisation task , instructed speech with memory recall and instructed speech without memory recall . Baseline reading . All participants read aloud a paragraph of North Wind and Sun once using their habitual speaking voice . Instructed speech with memory recall . After a 3 - minute resting period , participants were seated before a computer screen ( Dell analogue LCD monitor ) wearing headphones ( Sennheiser HD280 Pro ) . Eight visual stimuli ( abstract shapes , see Figure 1 ) and eight verbal stimuli ( Cantonese disyllabic words , see Figure 1 ) were randomly presented for 2 seconds ( E - prime version 2 . 0 ) . Visual stimuli were presented visually and verbal stimuli were presented auditorally . Participants were asked to memorise as many of the items as they could for later recall . To limit involve - ment of the visuospatial sketchpad in short - term storage of the verbal stimuli and involvement of the phonological loop in short - term storage of the visual stimuli , the stimuli were deliberately abstract . That is , the visual stimuli were difficult to verbalise and the verbal stimuli were difficult to visualise . Pilot work ( n ¼ 5 participants ) suggested that recall of the visual and verbal items was similar ( mean ¼ 6 . 6 , SD ¼ 1 . 1 and mean ¼ 7 . 0 , SD ¼ 1 . 4 , respectively ) . Following presentation of the stimuli , participants again completed a 1 - minute reading aloud task ; however , they were instructed to speak with max - imum pitch variation . Participants in the visual analogy instruction group were presented with an image of a ‘‘choppy sea’’ ( Figure 2 ) and were instructed to ‘‘read aloud the paragraph like this picture’’ , whereas participants in the verbal analogy instruction group were instructed to ‘‘read aloud the paragraph like a choppy sea’’ . Participants in the explicit instruction group were instructed to ‘‘read aloud the paragraph with maximum pitch variation . . . that is , read aloud with extremely high and low pitch variability’’ and participants in the uninstructed control group were asked to ‘‘read aloud the para - graph’’ , without any instruction . Immediately after the reading task , participants were asked to recall as many of the stimuli as possible , by drawing the visual stimuli or saying the verbal stimuli . Recall of a visual stimulus was considered to be correct if the partici - pant correctly replicated the identical shape and Figure 2 . Visual analogy instruction . Figure 1 .

Recall of a verbal stimulus was considered correct if the participant repeated the identical Cantonese disyllabic word . Instructed speech without memory recall . Finally , after a 3 - minute resting period , participants were asked to read aloud a new paragraph with maximum pitch variation , using the same instructions that were provided in the previous condition . No memory recall was required . Dependent measures Praat software was used to measure the mean SDF 0 of the speech samples . Females tend to speak with higher pitch than males ( Grieser & Kuhl , 1988 ) , so the absolute values of SDF 0 ( in the unit of Hertz ) were converted to a logarithmic scale ( in the unit of semitone relative to an arbitrary musical note A1 or 55 Hz ) to permit gender comparisons . All spectro - grams were examined for mistracking errors of pitch by visually inspecting the narrowband spectrogram using the pitch analysis function provided by the Praat software . Any mistrackings were smoothed and filtered based on 20 Hz ( minimum ) and 2000 Hz ( maximum ) , using the Praat software ( Styler , 2013 ) . Each speech sample was extracted manually and pauses ( i . e . the period of time that the signal fell below 95 % of peak intensity in the intensity envelope shown in Praat ) during reading were removed . Reliability As manual segment extraction of speech samples involves subjective judgement , inter - and intra - experimenter reliability was determined . Inter - experimenter reliability was examined by having a research assistant repeat the segment extraction for 50 % of the audio - recorded clips ( speech samples of 20 participants ) . The extractions were considered to be correct if their duration did not differ by more than 5 % . The overall inter - experiment agreement was 96 . 26 % . Intra - experimenter reliability was determined by the first author who repeated the calculations on all samples 1 week after the first calculation ; agreement was 95 . 81 % . Data analysis For pitch variability using semitone as dependant measurement , a two - way ANOVA with repeated measures was used to examine the difference in pitch variability for the four groups ( non - instructed , explicit instructions , verbal analogy instructions and visual analogy instructions ) in the three testing conditions ( baseline reading , instructed speech with memory recall and instructed speech without memory recall ) . Correlations between overall digit span test and recall measures were examined using Pearson correlational coefficient . For memory recall analysis , non - parametric data analysis using Wilcoxon’s tests was used to examine within - group differences in the number of visual and verbal stimuli recalled . Kruskal - Wallis one - way analysis of variance was used to examine between - group differences in recall of visual stimuli and verbal stimuli separately . Also , Mann - Whitney tests with a Bonferroni adjust - ment ( p ¼ 0 . 05 / 6 ¼ 0 . 0083 ) were used to examine if there were any pairwise differences . Non - parametric tests were used because the data ( i . e . number of visual and verbal stimuli recalled ) was nominal in nature . Result Pitch variation The two - way ANOVA revealed a main effect of Condition ( F ( 2 , 72 ) ¼ 46 . 52 , p ¼ 0 . 001 , (cid:2) 2 ¼ 0 . 56 ) and Group ( F ( 3 , 36 ) ¼ 5 . 90 , p ¼ 0 . 002 , (cid:2) 2 ¼ 0 . 33 ) and a significant interaction between Condition and Group ( F ( 6 , 72 ) ¼ 11 . 94 , p ¼ 0 . 001 , (cid:2) 2 ¼ 0 . 50 ) ( Figure 3 ) . Separate one - way ANOVAs showed no differences in the non - instructed control group or the explicit instructions group ( p 4 0 . 05 ) ; however , Figure 3 .

D o w n l o a d e d by [ N e w Y o r k U n i v e r s it y ] a t 02 : 18 10 M a r c h 2016 differences were evident in both analogy instruction groups ( p 5 0 . 05 ) . Bonferroni adjusted ( p ¼ 0 . 05 / 3 ¼ 0 . 0167 ) for three pairwise comparisons showed that SDF 0 of participants in both analogy instruction groups increased significantly from baseline reading to instructed speech with memory recall and instructed speech without memory recall ( p 5 0 . 001 ) . SDF 0 did not differ in the instructed speech with memory recall and instructed speech without memory recall conditions ( p 4 0 . 0167 ) . Memory recall Significant correlations between overall digit span test and recall measures were not evident ( r ¼ 0 . 47 – 0 . 69 , all p s 4 0 . 05 ) , indicating that spurious effects of baseline working memory ability did not influence memory recall . The number of visual and verbal stimuli recalled in each group is presented in Table I . With the use of Wilcoxon’s tests , significantly fewer visual stimuli were recalled than verbal stimuli in the visual analogy group ( median ¼ 3 . 0 and 4 . 0 , respect - ively ; T ¼ 0 . 00 , p 5 0 . 05 , r ¼ (cid:2) 0 . 64 ) . Differences in recall of visual or verbal stimuli were not evident in the other groups ( p 4 0 . 05 ) . For recall of visual stimuli , significant differences were evident by Kruskal - Wallis one - way analysis of variance , H ( 3 ) ¼ 9 . 91 , p 5 0 . 05 . Mann - Whitney tests with a Bonferroni adjustment ( p ¼ 0 . 05 / 6 ¼ 0 . 0083 ) revealed that participants in the visual analogy instruction group recalled significantly fewer visual stimuli than those in the uninstructed control group ( U ¼ 16 , r ¼ (cid:2) 0 . 59 , p 5 0 . 0083 ) , but no other differ - ences emerged ( p 4 0 . 05 ) . For recall of verbal stimuli , Kruskal - Wallis one - way analysis of variance showed that significant differences were also evident between groups , H ( 3 ) ¼ 15 . 51 , p 5 0 . 05 . Mann - Whitney tests , using the same Bonferroni adjustment , indicated that participants in the explicit instructions group recalled significantly fewer verbal stimuli than those in the visual analogy instruction group ( U ¼ 9 . 0 , r ¼ (cid:2) 0 . 72 , p 5 0 . 0083 ) or the unin - structed control group ( U ¼ 5 . 5 , r ¼ (cid:2) 0 . 77 , p 5 0 . 0083 ) . There were no other significant differ - ences ( p 4 0 . 05 ) . Overall recall was also significantly different between the groups , H ( 3 ) ¼ 10 . 87 , p 5 0 . 05 . Mann - Whitney tests indicated that participants in the explicitly instructed group recalled significantly fewer stimuli ( Mean ¼ 5 . 10 ; SD ¼ 1 . 71 ) than in the uninstructed control group ( Mean ¼ 8 . 90 ; SD ¼ 1 . 70 ) , U ¼ 12 . 0 , r ¼ (cid:2) 0 . 65 , p 5 0 . 0083 , but that no other differences were evident ( p 4 0 . 05 ) . Discussion The purpose of the present study was to examine speech motor performance ( i . e . reading with max - imum pitch variation ) following different types of instructions and to examine the nature of the cognitive demands imposed on working memory by the instructions . With this purpose , it would enable us to have a better understanding on how analogy works from the theoretical framework of working memory ; that is , whether analogy instruc - tion requires less working memory as suggested by previous studies ( e . g . Liao & Masters , 2001 ; Lam et al . , 2009 ) . Not surprisingly , uninstructed control participants displayed no change in pitch variability between baseline reading and reading with or with - out memory recall . Significantly increased pitch variability in response to both modes of analogy instruction ( verbal , visual ) occurred with and with - out the memory recall task , suggesting that partici - pants were able to memorise the requirement to speak with greater pitch variation , despite the demands of the recall task . In previous motor learning studies , robust performance under second - ary task loading has also been demonstrated follow - ing analogy instructions ( e . g . Lam et al . , 2009 , Liao & Masters , 2001 ) . However , these effects have always been demonstrated after a period of prac - tice / learning . Here the effects of analogy instructions were evident post - instruction , without the need for practice . Limb and speech motor control share many commonalities in terms of motor planning and execution ( Grimme , Fuchs , Perrier , & Scho¨ner , 2011 ) , but one distinctive feature of speech motor control is that the motor goals follow each other in a rapid sequence of articulatory events , which require advanced planning and coordination to enable fast anticipatory adjustments to predictable articulatory challenges ( Grimme et al . , 2011 ) . Surprisingly , participants who were instructed explicitly displayed no increase in pitch variability compared to baseline . The cognitive demands associated with conceptualising and executing the explicit instructions may have been greater than in the analogy instruction conditions . Consistent with this possibility , the explicitly instructed participants displayed the poorest overall recall of stimuli , although the differences only reached statistical significance for the the uninstructed control group . More telling , the explicitly instructed participants recalled the fewest verbal stimuli , implying that demands associated with processing the instructions targeted the phonological component of working memory . As expected , participants instructed by visual analogy recalled significantly fewer visual stimuli Table I . Number of visual and verbal stimuli recalled of different groups .

Their recall of verbal stimuli , however , was not different to the uninstructed control par - ticipants , suggesting that presentation of the analogy visually , reduced demands on the phonological component of working memory . The verbal analogy instructed participants did not display differences in recall of visual and verbal stimuli . We expected that processing the descriptive content of the verbal analogy would utilise the phonological component of working memory and thus impair recall of verbal stimuli ; however , it is likely that the multimodal nature of the ‘‘visual’’ representation potentially evoked by the verbal analogy ( e . g . Donnelly & McDaniel , 1993 ) utilised the visuospatial component of working memory , thus impacting recall of visual stimuli equally . Given the human ability for multimodal represen - tation and integration of objects and words ( e . g . Stein & Meredith , 1993 ) , it is perhaps not surprising that the visual and verbal modes of analogy had an identical effect on overall stimulus recall . Our work suggests , however , that the mechanisms underlying that effect may differ with respect to the mode in which the information is initially presented . Theories of embodied cognition propose that human cognition and the manner in which we represent objects , experiences or abstract phenomena , such as analo - gies , is influenced by our physical interactions with the environment ( e . g . Wilson , 2002 ) . In particular , the visual modality integrates information from other senses ( e . g . Roach , Heron , & McGraw , 2006 ; Witten & Knudsen , 2005 ) , so it is perhaps not surprising that the visual analogy had a differential effect on memory recall , appearing to load the visuospatial component of working memory more heavily . Our findings may have implications for treatment of clinical populations such as individuals with dysarthria ( Schlenck , Bettrich , & Willmes , 1993 ) or speakers with athetoid dysarthria ( Darley , Aronson , & Brown , 1975 ) , who are known to struggle with the demands of controlling pitch variation during speech . However , speech - language pathologists should be aware of the finite working memory capacity . For example , the working memory deficits exhibited by some of the children with specific language impartment are closely associated with their language impairments ( Marton , & Schwartz , 2003 ; Montgomery et al . , 2010 ) . It is , therefore , important to assess working memory capacity in the speech language impaired population so as to develop the most suitable treatment strategy ( e . g . phonological short - term memory training ) for them ( Montgomery et al . , 2010 ) . Our findings may also have implications for experts and novices . Schlapkohl , Hohmann , and Raab ( 2012 ) , for exam - ple , showed that explicit instructions were more effective than analogy instructions when teaching expert table tennis players to acquire a new hitting style . The experts acquired significantly more declarative knowledge about the task , but the knowledge did not appear to overload working memory or disrupt performance . Analogy instruc - tions were more effective for novices , however . Analogy instructions may therefore be suitable for patients who display cognitive deficits that reduce their ability to process verbal information , or for children whose working memory components were shown to be separable . Alloway , Gathercole , and Pickering ( 2006 ) showed that the storage compo - nents ( visuospatial sketchpad and phonological loop ) and processing component ( the executive control ) were seperable in a child population . Therefore , we speculated that analogy of either visual or verbal modes may be equivalently useful for children to learn the similar speech motor tasks as in the present study . Analogy in both presentation modes may lower the workload of executive control ( i . e . processing component ) without interfering with the storage capacity on visuospatial and phono - logical components ( i . e . the storage component ) as a result of the separability ( Alloway et al . , 2006 ) . Further investigation on this speculation in a child population is warrented . Limitations One of the limitations in using analogy is the indigenous culture background of the learners . Poolton , Masters , and Maxwell ( 2007 ) suggested that , if the content of an analogy is not appropriate for the indigenous culture , the advantage ( i . e . the lower cognitive demand in this case ) can be lost . It is , important for speech - language pathologists to adopt culturally suited analogical instructions to convey their desired message to clients . We acknow - ledge also that analogies and metaphors may play very different roles within cultures and languages , which modifies their potential impact on conceptual understandings derived from logic or reasoning . Another limitation is the generalisability of the result due to the language nature between Cantonese and English . As Cantonese is a tonal language that carries different meanings with different tones , cognitive load , particularly demands on the phono - logical loop during change of pitch , may be different to other non - tonal languages , such as English . Future research comparing cognitive load associated with analogy instructions in different languages is warranted . Caution is needed , however , when drawing conclusions about the analogy instructions in terms of visual stimuli recall . There was no visual memory test before the experiment , so poor visual memory may have compromised recall of visual stimuli . Conclusion Our data suggest that analogical instructions poten - tially provide an effective alternative medium of 6 C . Y . Andy et al .

In cases where critical information from multiple modalities must be processed , visually presented analogies may be more effective because they appear to load primarily visuospatial components of work - ing memory , leaving phonological components free to memorise other verbal information .
