TGF - b induction of stress ﬁbers in epithelial cells requires high molecular weight tropomyosins encoded by TPM1 and TPM2 genes . Here , we investigated the mechanism underlying the failure of TGF - b to induce stress ﬁbers and inhibit cell migration in metastatic cells . RT – PCR analysis in carcinoma cell lines revealed a signiﬁcant reduction in TPM1 transcripts in metastatic MDA - MB - 231 , MDA - MB - 435 and SW620 cell lines . Treatment of these cells with demethylating agent 5 - aza - 2 0 - deoxycytidine ( 5 - aza - dC ) increased mRNA levels of TPM1 with no effect on TPM2 . Importantly , 5 - aza - dC treatment of MDA - MB - 231 cells restored TGF - b induction of TPM1 and formation of stress ﬁbers . Forced expression of TPM1 by using Tet - Off system increased stress ﬁbers in MDA - MB - 231 cells and reduced cell migration . A potential CpG island spanning the TPM1 proximal promoter , exon 1 , and the beginning of intron 1 was identiﬁed . Bisulﬁte sequencing showed signiﬁcant cytosine methylation in metastatic cell lines that corre - lated with a reduced expression of TPM1 . Together these results suggest that epigenetic suppression of TPM1 may alter TGF - b tumor suppressor function and contribute to metastatic properties of tumor cells . Oncogene ( 2005 ) 24 , 5043 – 5052 . doi : 10 . 1038 / sj . onc . 1208688 ; published online 9 May 2005 Keywords : metastasis ; TGF - b ; tropomyosin ; Smad ; DNA methylation Introduction The transforming growth factor beta ( TGF - b ) signaling pathway is a major cellular growth inhibitory and proapoptotic pathway in epithelial , endothelial , hema - topoietic and other cell types ( Roberts and Wakeﬁeld , 2003 ) . Clinical and experimental studies indicate that TGF - b can enhance the metastatic behavior of the tumor cells ( Saito et al . , 2000 ; Derynck et al . , 2001 ) . This apparent paradox has been associated with a progressive decline in TGF - b antitumorigenic function and a gain of protumorigenic activities including induction of epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , cell migration and invasion during tumor progression ( Derynck et al . , 2001 ; Roberts and Wake - ﬁeld , 2003 ) . Oncogenic Ras , Src and ErbB2 as well as alterations in TGF - b signaling mediated by Smads , mitogen - activated protein ( MAP ) kinases , Rho kinases and Akt / PKB are thought to contribute to the meta - static phenotype ( Derynck et al . , 2001 ; Roberts and Wakeﬁeld , 2003 ) . The actin cytoskeleton plays a central role in the regulation of cellular processes linked to metastasis including cell proliferation , apoptosis , anchorage - inde - pendent cell growth , cell migration , and invasion ( Jaffe and Hall , 2002 ) . Oncogenic transformation alters regulation and organization of the actin cytoskeleton by suppressing actin - binding proteins involved in stabilization of actin microﬁlaments ( Pawlak and Helf - man , 2001 ) or by disabling the RhoA / ROCK pathway ( Sahai et al . , 2001 ; Pawlak and Helfman , 2002a , b ; Vial et al . , 2003 ) . In normal and tumor epithelial cells , TGF - b regulates dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton ( Bakin et al . , 2002 ; Edlund et al . , 2002 ) through mechanisms involving Smads ( Piek et al . , 1999 ) , Rho kinase ( Bhowmick et al . , 2001 ) and p38 MAP kinase ( Hanni - gan et al . , 1998 ; Bakin et al . , 2002 ; Edlund et al . , 2002 ) . A recent study has shown that high molecular weight ( HMW ) tropomyosins are critical components of Smad / p38MAPK - dependent actin stress ﬁber formation in response to TGF - b in epithelial cells ( Bakin et al . , 2004 ) . In normal and tumor nonmetastatic epithelial cells TGF - b upregulates HMW tropomyosins through p38MAPK - and Smad - dependent mechanisms leading to the formation of stable actin ﬁlaments ( stress ﬁbers ) and reduction of cell motility ( Bakin et al . , 2004 ) . Tropomyosins have been implicated in the assembly and stabilization of actin ﬁlaments and control of cell motility ( Pawlak and Helfman , 2001 ) . Tropomyosins form a - helical coil - coil dimers that bind along the length of the actin ﬁlaments interacting with 6 – 7 actin monomers and stabilize actin ﬁlaments ( Ayscough , 1998 ) . In vertebrates , more than 10 different isoforms of HMW tropomyosins are expressed from TPM1 ( a - TM ) and TPM2 ( b - TM ) genes , and by alternative RNA splicing ( Pittenger et al . , 1994 ) . Early studies have shown that cell transformation by oncogenic Ras and Src leads to downregulation of HMW tropomyosins and Received 30 December 2004 ; revised 15 February 2005 ; accepted 10 March 2005 ; published online 9 May 2005 * Correspondence : AV Bakin ; E - mail : andrei . bakin @ roswellpark . org Oncogene ( 2005 ) 24 , 5043 – 5052 & 2005 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved 0950 - 9232 / 05 $ 30 . 00 www . nature . com / onc disruption of actin stress ﬁber ﬁlaments ( Leonardi et al . , 1982 ; Hendricks and Weintraub , 1984 ) . Subsequently , it has been found that ectopic expression of HMW tropomyosins in Ras - transformed ﬁbroblasts restores stress ﬁbers and signiﬁcantly reduces cell motility and cell growth ( Braverman et al . , 1996 ; Gimona et al . , 1996 ; Janssen and Mier , 1997 ) . Several studies have reported that high - grade tumors of breast , prostate , bladder and brain express signiﬁcantly lower levels of HMW tropomyosins compared to normal tissues ( Franzen et al . , 1996 ; Wang et al . , 1996 ; Hughes et al . , 2003 ; Raval et al . , 2003 ; Pawlak et al . , 2004 ) . Thus , HMW tropomyosins and thereby stress ﬁbers may play a critical role in control of tumor invasion and metastasis . Previously , we have reported that TPM1 was not regulated by TGF - b 1 in metastatic breast cancer MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Bakin et al . , 2004 ) , although these cells express TGF - b receptors and Smad signaling compo - nents ( Dumont et al . , 2003 ) . Here we investigated the mechanism underlying suppression of TPM1 gene expression in metastatic cells . Our data show that suppression of TPM1 gene expression is associated with hypermethylation of CpG sites within the TPM1 promoter in metastatic breast and colon cell lines . Demethylation of MDA - MB - 231 cells restored TGF - b induction of TPM1 expression and stress ﬁber forma - tion . Expression of tropomyosin in MDA - MB - 231 cells using Tet - Off system inhibited cell migration . Thus , epigenetic inactivation of TPM1 may alter TGF - b tumor suppressor function and contribute to acquisition of malignant phenotype . Results Stress ﬁber formation in response to TGF - b in epithelial cells We investigated TGF - b induction of tropomyosins and actin stress ﬁbers in human lung epithelial A549 cells , cervical carcinoma SiHa cells and breast carcinoma MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Figure 1a ) . Treatment of cells with TGF - b resulted in the formation of stress ﬁbers in SiHa and A549 cells , but not in MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Figure 1a ) . Tropomyosin expression was analysed with the TM311 monoclonal antibody recognizing the N - terminal epitope in tropomyosin 1 ( TM1 ) , a TPM2 gene product , and tropomyosin isoforms 2 , 3 and 6 ( TM2 , 3 , 6 ) , products of the TPM1 gene ( Temm - Grove et al . , 1998 ) . Immunoblotting showed that TGF - b stimulated expression of TM1 - 3 , and 6 in A549 and SiHa cells . TPM1 gene products were not expressed in MDA - MB - 231 cells , while TM1 , a TPM2 product , was expressed at signiﬁcantly lower levels compared to SiHa cells ( Figure 1b ) . RT – PCR with gene - speciﬁc primers showed TPM2 mRNA expression in both cell lines , whereas TPM1 mRNA was induced by TGF - b in SiHa and A549 cells but not in MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Figure 1c ) . MDA - MB - 231 cells express TGF - b recep - tors , Smad factors , and respond to TGF - b with activation of Smad and p38 MAPK signaling , as well as regulation of gene expression ( Bakin et al . , 2002 ; Dumont et al . , 2003 ) . Hence , the absence of TPM1 expression in MDA - MB - 231 cells could arise from genetic or epigenetic abnormalities in the TPM1 gene or because tissue - speciﬁc differences in cell lines used . Together , these results indicate that the ability of TGF - b to induce stress ﬁbers in epithelial cells correlates b c a Figure 1 Actin stress ﬁbers and tropomyosin expression are upregulated by TGF - b 1 in epithelial cells .

Suppression of TPM1 expression in metastatic breast cancer cell lines by DNA methylation To rule out the involvement of tissue - speciﬁc differ - ences , mRNA levels of TPM1 and TPM2 were compared in several commonly used human mammary and colon epithelial cell lines by RT – PCR . TPM1 transcripts were expressed in normal MCF10A and several breast carcinoma cell lines , but were absent or found at lower levels in metastatic MDA - MB - 231 and MDA - MB - 435 cell lines ( Figure 2a ) . TPM2 transcripts were present at comparable levels in all examined breast cell lines ( Figure 2a ) . Of note , although TPM2 was expressed in MCF7 cells no TM1 protein was detected by immunoblotting ( A Bakin , unpublished ; Bharadwaj and Prasad , 2002 ) , suggesting a post - transcriptional regulation of the TPM2 gene expression in these cells . To further test a correlation between TPM1 expression and a metastatic behavior of tumor cells , tropomyosin transcripts were examined in two colon cancer cell lines established from primary tumor ( SW480 ) and a meta - static lesion ( SW620 ) of the same patient ( Gagos et al . , 1995 ) . TPM2 was expressed in both cell lines , whereas TPM1 transcripts were below a detection level in metastatic SW620 cells ( Figure 2d ) . These results indicate that TPM1 is expressed in normal mammary epithelial cells , but signiﬁcantly reduced or absent in metastatic cell lines . To determine whether DNA methylation contributes to suppression of the TPM1 gene in breast cancer MDA - MB - 231 and MDA - MB - 435 cell lines , tumor cells were treated with demethylating agent 5 - aza - dC . RT – PCR analysis showed that 5 - aza - dC treatment restored TPM1 expression in MDA - MB - 435 cells to the levels comparable with MCF10A and MCF7 cell lines ( Figure 2b ) . Treatment with 5 - aza - dC of MDA - MB - 231 cells increased TPM1 mRNA levels that were further upregulated by TGF - b 1 ( Figure 2c ) . TPM2 transcripts were reduced by approximately 40 % in 5 - aza - dC - treated cells ( Figure 2d ) , although , TPM2 protein level ( TM1 isoform ) was induced ( Figure 3b ) , suggesting indirect effect of 5 - aza - dC on TPM2 expres - sion . These results indicate that DNA methylation may be involved in suppression of the TPM1 gene expression in metastatic carcinoma cell lines , and that low expression of HMW tropomyosins correlates with metastatic phenotype of tumor cells . Re - expression of TPM1 in MDA - MB - 231 cells results in stress ﬁber formation To verify RT – PCR data and to test effects of TPM1 expression on stress ﬁber formation , we examined tropomyosin proteins and actin ﬁlaments in 5 - aza - dC - treated MDA - MB - 231 cells .

Immuno - blot analysis revealed induction of TM2 / 3 isoforms by TGF - b 1 in 5 - aza - dC - treated MDA - MB - 231 cells and enhancement of basal TM1 expression ( Figure 3b ) . Since MEK - ERK signaling may affect tropomyosin expression ( Bakin et al . , 2004 ) , we examined phosphor - ylation and total levels of ERK1 / 2 in control and 5 - aza - dC - treated MDA - MB - 231 cells . Immunoblots showed that 5 - aza - dC - treatment did not decrease levels of phospho - ERK1 / 2 and total ERK1 / 2 ( Figure 3c ) . This result indicates that induction of TPM1 in 5 - aza - dC - treated MDA - MB - 231 cells cannot be explained by inhibition of ERK1 / 2 . Phalloidin staining showed higher levels of microﬁla - ments in 5 - aza - dC - treated MDA - MB - 231 cells com - pared to control cells that were further enhanced by treatment with TGF - b 1 ( Figure 3d ) . Importantly , 5 - aza - dC treatment inhibited wound closure in MDA - MB - 231 cell monolayers in response to TGF - b 1 , indicating that de - methylation reduces cell migration ( Figure 4 ) . We then asked whether ectopic expression of TM3 encoded by the TPM1 gene , in MDA - MB - 231 cells is sufﬁcient for stress ﬁber formation . Rat TM3 cDNA ( Gimona et al . , 1996 ) was transiently transfected in MDA - MB - 231 cells and expression of HA - tagged TM3 was conﬁrmed by immunoblotting ( Figure 3e , inset ) . Actin microﬁlament ﬁbers were signiﬁcantly increased in TM3 - expressing cells even in the absence of TGF - b 1 compared to control cells ( Figure 3e ) . Selection of stable TM3 clones failed as TM3 - expressing cells did not grow and eventually died due to block in cytokinesis and accumulation of multiple nuclei . To overcome this problem we generated MDA - MB - 231 Tet - Off cells with inducible expression of rat TM3 . Expression of tropo - myosin was induced by incubating the Tet - Off cells in the absence of doxycycline ( Figure 5a ) .

TM3 - expressing cells showed an increase in actin microﬁlament ﬁbers and reduction in actin rufﬂes at the cell edges compared to cells grown in the presence of doxycycline when TM3 is not expressed ( Figure 5b ) . Migration of TM3 - expressing cells in transwell assay was reduced approximately 1 . 7 - fold ( Figure 5c , d ) . These results suggest that DNA methylation is involved in silencing of the TPM1 gene in MDA - MB - 231 cells , and that re - expression of TPM1 leads to stress ﬁbers and reduces cell migration . Identiﬁcation of a CpG island in the TPM1 promoter The TPM1 gene is expressed in most tissues and its disruption in mice results in early embryonic lethality , suggesting that it is critically involved in development ( Robbins , 1998 ) . We hypothesized that TPM1 may contain a CpG island in the promoter . As no studies have reported on the DNA structure of human TPM1 gene , database - mining was performed to deﬁne the exon – intron structure , promoter and CpG island of human TPM1 gene . Comparison of the 5 0 cDNA sequences of mammalian TPM1 with mouse and human genomic DNA ( gDNA ) sequences obtained from BLAT ( http : / / genome . ucsc . edu / cgi - bin / hgBlat ) using ClustalW ( http : / / www . ebi . ac . uk / clustalw ) revealed that the 5 0 - end of the mouse cDNA is located within 21 bp from a TATATA sequence , which is identical in both human and mouse gDNA sequences ( Figure 6a ) . The potential TATA box is located in the highly conserved gDNA region containing several Sp1 - like binding sequences . The analysis of gDNA sequences using BLAT revealed two large CpG islands in both human TPM1 and mouse Tpm1 , with one near exon 1 and the other in a region further downstream , in a sequence aligning with rat exon 1b ( GenBank accession M34137 ) . The CpG islands of both human and mouse TPM1 conformed to the CpG island deﬁnition ( Antequera and Bird , 1993 ; Cross and Bird , 1995 ) . The two human TPM1 CpG islands are of length 1 . 829 kb with 163 CpG sites , a G / C content of 67 % and a CpG : GpC ratio of 0 . 8 ; and 1 . 208 kb with 110 CpG sites , a G / C content of 70 % and a CpG : GpC ratio of 0 . 71 , covering putative exons 1 and 1b , respectively . The human 1 . 8 kb TPM1 CpG island encompasses the transcription start , exon 1 and a portion of intron 1 ( Figure 6a ) . This region contains several potential Sp1 - binding sites overlapping with CpG dinucleotides . To test whether Sp1 is involved in TPM1 expression , mouse mammary epithelial NMuMG cells were treated with TGF - b 1 in the presence of MTA , which inhibits Sp1 binding to DNA and TGF - b 1 - induced gene expression ( Chung et al . , 1996 ; Albo et al . , 1997 ; Greenwel et al . , 1997 ; Park et al . , 2000 ) . Treatment with 200 n M MTA signiﬁcantly reduced basal and TGF - b 1 - induced levels of TPM1 transcripts , suggesting involvement of Sp1 - like factors in TGF - b 1 - mediated induction of the TPM1 expression ( Figure 6b ) . Thus , both human and mouse TPM1 genes contain CpG islands , and the proximal promoter CpG island includes a putative transcription start site , the TATA box and Sp1 - like sites . Methylation of the TPM1 CpG island in metastatic cell lines We investigated DNA methylation of the human 1 . 8 kb TPM1 CpG island by the bisulﬁte - sequencing method ( Frommer et al . , 1992 ) .

The methylation status of 30 CpG dinucleotides sites in cell lines is shown in Figure 6c . DNA - bisulﬁte - sequencing showed a nearly complete methylation of CpG sites in MDA - MB - 231 cells and a high degree of methylation in MDA - MB - 435 cells ( Figure 6c ) . The level of DNA methylation inversely correlated with expression level of TPM1 mRNA in these cells ( Figure 6c and 2a ) . 5 - aza - dC - treatment of MDA - MB - 231 resulted in demethylation of cytosine residues ( Figure 6c ) and increased TPM1 expression ( Figure 2c , 3b ) . Colon cancer SW480 cell line showed a low level of DNA methylation and also expressed TPM1 mRNA ( compare Figure 6c and 2d ) . Metastatic SW620 cell line showed a high level of DNA methylation ( Figure 6c ) and very low levels of TPM1 , which was upregulated by 5 - aza - dC treatment ( Figure 2d ) . Thus , high level of methylation of TPM1 promoter region correlates with low TPM1 expression and demethylation of DNA upregulates TPM1 expression in metastatic cell lines . Discussion The molecular mechanism ( s ) underlying the prometa - static conversion of the TGF - b function at the late stages of tumorigenesis is not well understood ( Derynck et al . , 2001 ; Roberts and Wakeﬁeld , 2003 ) . TGF - b function in development of highly invasive and meta - static tumors has been associated with induction of EMT , cell migration and activity of matrix proteinases ( Derynck et al . , 2001 ; Wakeﬁeld and Roberts , 2002 ) . Recent studies have shown that stimulation of cell migration by TGF - b inversely correlates with expression of HMW tropomyosins encoded by TPM1 and TPM2 genes involved in formation of stable actin ﬁlaments ( stress ﬁbers ) ( Bakin et al . , 2004 ) . Here , we report that TPM1 promoter hypermethylation correlates with a reduced expression of tropomyosins and inability of TGF - b to induce stress ﬁbers in metastatic carcinoma cells . Tropomyosins are actin - binding proteins involved in stabilization of actin ﬁlaments and control of cell motility ( Pawlak and Helfman , 2001 ) . Although the role of tropomyosins in muscle contraction is well established , their role in non - muscle cells is less clear . Several lines of evidence suggest that HMW tropomyo - sins encoded by TPM1 ( a - TM ) and TPM2 ( b - TM ) genes may contribute in tumor suppressor activity of TGF - b : ( i ) HMW tropomyosins are required for TGF - b - mediated formation of stress ﬁbers and inhibition of cell migration ( Bakin et al . , 2004 ) ; ( ii ) oncogenic Ras and Src downregulate HMW tropomyosins leading to disruption of actin stress ﬁber ﬁlaments ( Hendricks and Weintraub , 1981 ; Leonardi et al . , 1982 ) and ectopic expression of HMW tropomyosins in Ras - or Src - tranformed cells restores stress ﬁbers and reduces cell motility and cell growth ( Braverman et al . , 1996 ; Gimona et al . , 1996 ; Janssen and Mier , 1997 ) ; and ( iii ) high - grade tumors of breast , prostate , bladder , and brain express signiﬁcantly lower levels of HMW tropomyosins compared to normal tissues ( Franzen et al . , 1996 ; Wang et al . , 1996 ; Hughes et al . , 2003 ; Raval et al . , 2003 ; Pawlak et al . , 2004 ) . In this study , a marked reduction in HMW tropo - myosin was found in metastatic breast and colon cancer cell lines ( Figure 2 ) . Low tropomyosin levels in metastatic breast cancer MDA - MB - 231 cells correlated with a reduced stress ﬁber formation in response to TGF - b ( Figure 1 ) . Recently , we have reported that Ras - MEK signaling decreases TPM2 expression and stress ﬁber formation in MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Bakin et al . , 2004 ) . The current study showed the absence of basal and TGF - b 1 - regulated expression of the TPM1 gene in MDA - MB - 231 cells , although these cells express TGF - b receptors and Smad signaling components ( Dumont et al . , 2003 ) . TPM1 mRNA expression is also reduced in metastatic breast cancer MDA - MB - 435 cell line and in metastatic colon cancer SW620 cell line ( Figure 2 ) . Interestingly , colon cancer SW480 cell line established from the primary lesion of the same patient expressed higher level of TPM1 compared to metastatic SW620 . These ﬁndings show that low level of TPM1 expression correlates with metastatic phenotype of tumor cells . Treatment of metastatic breast and colon cancer cell lines with demethylating agent 5 - aza - dC increased TPM1 expression ( Figure 2 ) . Previously , one study has reported that 5 - aza - dC treatment upregulates expression of TPM2 , but not TPM1 , in MCF7 and MDA - MB - 231 cell lines ( Bharadwaj and Prasad , 2002 ) , while another group showed that both TPM1 and TPM2 are up - regulated in ﬁbrosarcoma HT1080 cells ( Shields et al . , 2002 ) . Both of the studies used Northern blot probes that do not distinguish TPM1 and TPM2 genes . In the Figure 6 The human TPM1 promoter and methylation of a CpG island .

Sp1 - like sites are depicted above the sequence . The CpG dinucleotides are in bold font and underlined . The positions of the bisulﬁte - speciﬁc primers relative to the promoter and exon 1 are shown . ( b ) Effect of mithramycin A on Tpm1 expression in response to TGF - b 1 in NMuMG cells examined by RT – PCR . b - actin ( Actb ) is a control . ( c ) Methylation analysis of 30 CpG pairs from a 328 bp region of the human TPM1 CpG island in human cell lines and tissue samples . The presence of methylated cytosine at CpG sites in DNA from cancer - derived cell lines and 5 - aza - dC - treated MDA - MB - 231 . PCR fragments of bisulﬁte treated DNA were cloned into pGEM - Teasy and sequenced in both directions . The sequencing results for the individual CpG sites are depicted . Each horizontal line depicts a single clone and black circles represent methylated cytosines ; open circles : unmethylated cytosines ; and gray circles : equivocal data . CpG sites are positioned with respect to the þ 1 ( Figure 4 ) : (cid:2) 162 , (cid:2) 143 , (cid:2) 141 , (cid:2) 134 , (cid:2) 124 , (cid:2) 119 , (cid:2) 113 , (cid:2) 108 , (cid:2) 99 , (cid:2) 85 , (cid:2) 83 , (cid:2) 64 , (cid:2) 55 , (cid:2) 51 , (cid:2) 48 , (cid:2) 43 , (cid:2) 40 , (cid:2) 35 , (cid:2) 8 , þ 8 , þ 11 , þ 15 , þ 21 , þ 29 , þ 33 , þ 40 , þ 42 , þ 51 , þ 64 , þ 69 Methylation of Tropomyosin - 1 in metastatic cells AE Varga et al 5049 Oncogene current study , RT – PCR with TPM1 and TPM2 gene - speciﬁc primers was used to show that TPM2 transcripts are expressed at comparable levels in all tested breast cancer and normal cell lines , whereas TPM1 is down - regulated in metastatic MDA - MB - 231 , MDA - MB - 435 and SW620 cell lines ( Figure 2 ) . 5 - aza - dC treatment signiﬁcantly enhanced TPM1 mRNA levels but not TPM2 in all three metastatic cell lines ( Figure 2 ) . These data suggest that methylation may not regulate TPM2 expression directly . Demethylation of MDA - MB - 231 cells restored the ability of TGF - b to induce TPM1 expression , stress ﬁbers and reduced cell migration ( Figures 3 and 4 ) , suggesting that silencing of TPM1 by DNA methylation reduces stress ﬁbers and enhances cell motility . Importantly , expression of TPM1 gene product in MDA - MB - 231 cells using Tet - Off system increased stress ﬁbers and reduced cell migration ( Figure 5 ) . However , TGF - b can induce stress ﬁbers even in the absence of TPM1 expression ( Bakin et al . , 2004 ) . A forced expression of either TPM1 or TPM2 can reduce anchorage - independent cell growth ( Boyd et al . , 1995 ; Braverman et al . , 1996 ; Masuda et al . , 1996 ) and TPM2 can induce anoikis ( Raval et al . , 2003 ) . These facts suggest that a critical threshold level of HMW tropomyosins encoded by TPM1 and TPM2 genes is required for stress ﬁber formation in response to TGF - b in epithelial cells . Database - mining revealed in both human and mouse TPM1 genes a CpG island within a proximal promoter region , which includes the TATA box , a putative transcription start site , and several Sp1 - like sites ( Figure 5 ) . Bisulﬁte sequencing showed a high degree of cytosine methylation within the (cid:2) 186 þ 142 region of the TPM1 promoter in metastatic cell lines , but not in cell lines established from non - neoplastic ( MCF10A ) or primary tumors ( MCF7 , SiHa and SW480 ) ( Figure 5c ) . Treatment with demethylating agent of metastatic breast cancer MDA - MB - 231 cells removed methylation and upregulated TPM1 expression , suggesting an inverse correlation between TPM1 expression and hypermethylation of the TPM1 promoter . Basal expression of TPM1 appears to not require Smad4 since TPM1 is expressed in Smad4 - null MDA - MB - 468 cells ( Figure 2 ) . However , Smad4 is required for TGF - b induction of TPM1 ( Bakin et al . , 2004 ) . Experiments with MTA suggest that Sp1 or Sp1 - like factors may contribute to basal and TGF - b - mediated expression of TPM1 ( Figure 5b ) . Thus , TPM1 may represent a group of TGF - b target genes that are regulated by both Sp1 and Smads including p21CIP1 ( Moustakas and Kardassis , 1998 ) , alpha2 collagen ( Chung et al . , 1996 ; Greenwel et al . , 1997 ) and p15Ink4B ( Feng et al . , 2000 ) . Interestingly , Sp1 - mediated expres - sion of p21Cip1 is sensitive to DNA methylation ( Zhu et al . , 2003 ) . Thus , cytosine methylation in Sp1 - like sites of the TPM1 promoter may contribute in suppression of basal and TGF - b - induced expression of TPM1 . In summary , our studies revealed that hypermethyla - tion of the TPM1 promoter associates with a reduced TPM1 expression in metastatic cell lines . Suppression of TPM1 may underlie failure of TGF - b to induce stress ﬁbers and to inhibit migration in metastatic cells . Thus , epigenetic suppression of tropomyosin - mediated stress ﬁbers may represent an essential characteristic of pro - metastatic changes in TGF - b function and restoration of the stress ﬁber response is a potential strategy for antimetastatic therapy . Materials and methods Cell lines Human cell lines of breast carcinoma MCF7 , MDA - MB - 231 , MDA - MB - 435 , MDA - MB - 453 , MDA - MB - 468 , BT549 , SKBr3 and T - 47D , normal breast MCF10A , cervical carcino - ma SiHa , colon carcinoma SW480 and SW620 , lung carcino - ma A549 and mouse mammary epithelial cell line NMuMG were purchased from American Tissue Culture Collection ( ATCC ) . Cell lines were cultured as recommended by ATCC . Generation of Tet - Off MDA - MB - 231 cells Human breast carcinoma MDA - MB - 231 cells ( ATCC ) were cotransfected with pBabe - Puro and ptTA - IRES - Neo plasmid ( tTA , tet activator , IRES , internal ribosome entry site ) ( Yu et al . , 1999 ) . Puromycin - resistant clones exhibiting TGF - b responses equal to parental cells were selected in the presence of 1 m g / ml of puromycin . Two clones with a tight regulation of the tet - responsive reporter plasmid pBI - MCS - EGFP ( Yu et al . , 1999 ) were chosen to generate inducible cell lines . cDNA for rat tropomyosin 3 isoform ( Gimona et al . , 1996 ) was subcloned in pBluescript II KS ( þ ) ( Stratagene ) at Bam HI / Xba I sites and then shuttled into pTRE2hyg ( BD Biosciences Clontech , Palo Alto , CA , USA ) at Not I / Sal I sites to generate pTRE2hygTM3 . The MDA - MB - 231 Tet - Off cell lines were transfected with pTRE2hyg - TM3 encoding un - tagged rat TM3 and cells retaining TGF - b responses were selected in the presence of 200 m g / ml hygromycin and 2 m g / ml doxycycline . Induction of TM3 expression by removal of doxycycline was conﬁrmed by immunoblotting with TM311 antibody . Antibodies , plasmids and other reagents TGF - b 1 was obtained from R & D Systems . The following antibodies were used : mouse monoclonal to Smad2 / 3 ( BD Transduction Laboratories , BD Biosciences ) ; rabbit polyclo - nal to hemaglutinin ( HA ) epitope ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . ) ; mouse monoclonal TM311 to tropomyosin ( Sigma ) ; to phospho - Smad2 / 3 , phosphor - ERK1 / 2 and total ERK1 / 2 ( Cell Signaling ) . Phalloidin - Alexa Green and phalloidin - Texas Red were from Molecular Probes . Isolation of DNA and RNA DNA was isolated using the high salt extraction method ( Miller et al . , 1988 ) . RNA was isolated as described in Bakin and Curran ( 1999 ) . 5 - aza - 2 0 - deoxycytidine and TGF - b 1 treatment of cell lines MDA - MB - 231 cells ( 1 (cid:4) 10 6 ) were seeded into 25 cm 2 ﬂasks and were treated with 2 m M 5 - aza - 2 0 - deoxycytidine ( 5 - aza - dC ) for 48h . Cells were washed with PBS , and were incubated in fresh media for a further 48 h . Cells were seeded into 25 cm 2 ﬂasks and 2 m M 5 - aza - dC treatment was repeated , followed by Methylation of Tropomyosin - 1 in metastatic cells AE Varga et al 5050 Oncogene the addition of media containing 5 % serum . The next day , to cells requiring TGF - b 1 treatment , 2 ng / ml TGF - b 1 was added for 24h . DNA , RNA and protein were extracted from samples . MCF10A , MCF7 and MDA - MB - 435 were treated with 5 - aza - dC as previously described ( Li et al . , 2004 ) . Mithramycin A ( MTA ) treatment of cells NMuMG cells ( 6 (cid:4) 10 5 ) were seeded in media containing 5 % serum . Cells were subsequently left untreated or treated with both 200 m M MTA and 2ng / ml TGF - b 1 for 1 or 8h . Total RNA was analysed by RT – PCR for expression of TPM1 and b - actin . RT – PCR Ampliﬁcation of transcripts was performed using 50ng of total RNA and the one - step RT - PCR system from Invitrogen according to the manufacturer’s protocol , using primers designed with the assistance of Primer3 ( http : / / frodo . wi . mit . e - du / cgi - bin / primer3 / primer3 _ www . cgi ) . PCR in the one - step system were performed at an annealing temperature of 55 1 C within a linear range of ampliﬁcation .

Forward and reverse primers for human TPM1 and TPM2 genes cover amino acids 43 – 48 and 205 – 209 of TPM1 , and 65 – 71 and 145 – 150 amino acids of TPM2 , respectively . The associated product sizes for human TPM1 , TPM2 , b - actin and mouse Tpm1 and b - actin were 506 , 258 , 353 , 506 and 352 bp respectively . Transient transfection Plasmids encoding rat HA - tagged TM2 and TM3 isoforms ( Gimona et al . , 1995 ) were obtained from David Helfman ( CSHL , Cold Spring Harbor , NY , USA ) . In total , 10 m g plasmid was transfected with FuGENE 6 ( Roche ) into MDA - MB - 231 cells , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Identiﬁcation of CpG island within the TPM1 promoter and bisulﬁte sequencing The promoter region of human and mouse TPM1 genes were initially predicted using BLAST against rat exonic sequences , and then analysed in BLAT at http : / / genome . ucsc . edu / cgi - bin / hgBlat ( Genome Bioinformatics Group , University of Cali - fornia , USA ) . Both human and mouse CpG islands were identiﬁed in BLAT . Primers S1 - h a TM ( 5 0 - TTGGGGATTT - TAATGGTTGG - 3 0 ) and AS1 - h a TM ( 5 0 - CATTCCTCAAAA - CAACCAATACTT - 3 0 ) amplifying bisulﬁte - treated DNA were designed with Primer3 . Bisulﬁte treatment was performed as previously described ( Varga et al . , 2004 ) . PCR reactions were carried out under the following conditions : 3 min at 94 1 C , followed by 40 cycles of 30s at 94 1 C , 30 s at 50 1 C , and 55 s at 72 1 C , followed by a ﬁnal elongation for 7min at 72 1 C before holding at 4 1 C . PCR products were resolved on a 1 % agarose gel , puriﬁed with a PCR puriﬁcation kit ( Marligen Biosciences , USA ) and cloned into pGEM - Teasy ( Promega , USA ) . Clones were isolated and sequenced in both directions and CpG sites were analysed for methylation . Immunoblot analysis Cells were incubated in medium containing 5 % serum for 24 h prior to treatment with 2ng / ml TGF - b 1 . Cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 m M Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 137m M NaCl , 1 % NP - 40 , 10 % glycerol , 20m M NaF , 1m M Na orthovanadate , 1m M PMSF , 2 m g / ml aprotinin and 2 m g / ml leupeptin . Immunoblot analyses of whole - cell extracts were performed as described ( Bakin et al . , 2002 ) . Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy Cells ( 10 5 cells / well ) were grown in DMEM containing 5 % FBS on glass coverslips ( 22 (cid:4) 22 mm ) for 24 h before treatment with 2 ng / ml TGF - b 1 . Cells were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde and stained as described ( Bakin et al . , 2002 ) . Actin ﬁlaments were stained with phalloidin - Alexa Green or phalloidin - Texas Red and tropomyosins were visualized using TM311 antibody . Fluorescent images were captured using a Nikon TE2000 - E inverted microscope . Transwell migration The MDA - MB - 231 - Tet - Off - TM3 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 2 m g / ml doxycycline for 24h prior to the migration assay . Cells ( 1 (cid:4) 10 5 / well ) were placed in DMEM / 1 % FBS in the upper chamber of 5 - m m pore ( 24 - well ) transwells ( Costar , High Wycombe Bucks , UK ) and incubated alone or with 2 m g / ml doxycycline for 16h . The cells were ﬁxed in 100 % methanol and cells remaining at the top of the polycarbonate membrane were removed with cotton swabs . The cells that had migrated through pores to the lower surface were stained with Diff - quick stain ( VWR Scientiﬁc ) . Mem - branes were mounted on 25 (cid:4) 75 - mm 2 microslides . Cells were counted from ﬁve random ﬁelds at (cid:4) 200 magniﬁcation . Experiments were performed in duplicates . Wound closure assay MDA - MB - 231 cells ( 1 – 2 (cid:4) 10 5 / well ) were seeded in 12 - well plates . Cells were incubated in serum - free medium for 24 h prior to wounding . The wounds were made by scraping with plastic tip across the cell monolayer . The wounded cells were treated or untreated with 2 ng / ml TGF - b 1 . Phase contrast images were recorded at the time of wounding ( 0h ) and 20 h thereafter . Experiments were repeated with two independent 5 - aza - dC treatments .
