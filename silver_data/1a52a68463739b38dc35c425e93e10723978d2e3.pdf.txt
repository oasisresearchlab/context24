Journal of Inflammation ( 2023 ) 20 : 11 Introduction The coronavirus disease - 19 ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic remains a major challenge for healthcare systems world - wide . Severe acute respiratory syndrome - coronavirus - 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) infection can be asymptomatic or cause a disease ( called COVID - 19 ) of different grades of severity . The main cause of severe COVID - 19 and death is repre - sented by pneumonia with acute ( or acute on chronic ) respiratory failure until the acute respiratory distress syn - drome ( ARDS ) which requires often intensive care unit ( ICU ) admission and mechanical ventilation [ 1 ] . The molecular pathogenesis of COVID - 19 - related ARDS ( by now termed c - ARDS ) is still poorly under - stood . We will review here the literature on the genetic susceptibility , the pathogenesis and the local and sys - temic biomarkers correlated with c - ARDS compared with ARDS non - COVID - 19 - related including poten - tial new therapeutic options targeting the cell signalling pathways of c - ARDS . Genetic susceptibility in developing of c‑ARDS Many single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) and sev - eral autosomal or X - linked deficiency involving both innate and adaptative immune system and their intra - cellular pathways , may have a role in the development of c - ARDS [ 2 , 3 ] and are summarized in Table 1 . Spe - cifically , the genetic background can increase the cellular entry and the replication of SARS - CoV - 2 or the immuno - logical response to the infection . SNPs and deficiency of genes that increase SARS‑CoV‑2 entry and replication into airway cells ACE2 gene SNPs Several angiotensin I - converting enzyme ( ACE ) 2 SNPs ( located in Xp22 . 2 ) have shown an increased receptor affinity for the SARS - CoV - 2 proteins , therefore facili - tating its access into cells . For example , the ACE2 SNP rs2285666 GG genotype ( prevalence of 0 . 2 % and 0 . 55 % of European and Asian populations , respectively ) can triple the susceptibility to the development of severe COVID - 19 , whereas the TT genotype increases the risk of hospi - talization and acute respiratory failure [ 4 , 5 ] . TLRs SNPs and deficiency Autosomal dominant deficiencies of the toll - like receptor ( TLR ) 3 expression ( located in 4q35 . 1 ) including p .

Journal of Inflammation ( 2023 ) 20 : 11 WT , p . Pro554Ser / WT , p . Trp769 * / WT , p . Met870Val / WT are found in ~ 3 . 5 % of severe COVID - 19 patients ( and also in life - threatening influenza - associated pneumonia ) but absent in asymptomatic / mild SARS - CoV - 2 infected patients [ 6 ] . In addition , SNP rs3775291 of TLR3 is weakly cor - related with both susceptibility of SARS - CoV - 2 infection and mortality [ 7 ] . Moreover , also very rare X - linked TLR7 variants ( located in Xp22 . 2 ) in ~ 1 % male patients such as L134P / Y , N158Tfs11 * / Y , L227fs * / Y , D244Y / Y , F310L / Y , L372M , I505T / Y , H630Y / Y , I657T / Y , F670Lfs * 8 , F670Lfs * 8 , K684 * / Y , P715S / Y , H781L / Y , L988S / Y , L988S / Y and M854I ; L988S / Y were not found in asymptomatic / mild SARS - CoV - 2 infected patients , but only in some severe / critical COVID - 19 patients [ 8 ] . Pro‑inflammatory mediators signalling abnormalities Some patients with severe COVID - 19 , ~ 12 . 5 % and ~ 2 . 6 % in males and females respectively , have serum IgG neu - tralizing autoantibodies anti - interferon ( IFN ) α and / or IFNω not detectable in the asymptomatic / mild SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 9 ] . The SNP rs2236757 characterized by A allele of the interferons ( alpha , - beta , and - omega ) receptor 2 ( IFNAR2 ) , located in 21q22 . 11 , is weakly associated with its decreased expression and increased risk of severe COVID - 19 [ 10 , 11 ] . Other SNPs of IFNAR2 such as rs13050728 expressing T allele and rs33242905 are correlated to weak increased risk of severe COVID - 19 [ 7 , 12 , 13 ] . Moreover , an analysis of the Arabic population has shown that the rs12252 SNP within the interferon - induced transmembrane protein ( IFITM ) 3 gene ( geno - type GA or GG ) is strongly associated with increased risk of hospitalization due to COVID - 19 and mortal - ity , correlating with decreased serum IFNγ levels [ 14 ] ; whereas 2 studies on Caucasian and Chinese popula - tion have shown that this SNP was strongly correlated to increased risk of hospitalization when character - ized by the C allele , in particular when in homozygosis [ 15 , 16 ] . However , another study evaluating a German population has not confirmed these data showing that this SNP is not associated with increased risk of severe COVID - 19 [ 17 ] . Another study has shown that the rs10735079 SNP within the antiviral oligoadenylate synthase ( OAS ) - 1 and - 3 genes that are IFN - induced , are weakly correlated with increased risk of hospitalization during SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 18 , 19 ] . In addition , the rs28368148 ( CG genotype ) correlating with the interferon - alpha - 10 ( IFNA10 ) gene was found strongly correlating with severe COVID - 19 , whereas the rs8178521 ( CT genotype ) of the IL - 10 - receptor - beta ( IL - 10RB ) gene was found weakly correlated with severe COVID - 19 [ 13 ] . Moreover , although there is not a direct correlation with the SARS - CoV - 2 infection , both the rs6734238 ( located on 2q14 , GA genotype ) of the IL - 1R gene and the rs4537545 ( located on 1q21 , TC genotype ) of the IL - 6R gene are correlated with increased serum levels of IL - 6 that are correlated with COVID - 19 severity and in addition represent a main target in the COVID - 19 ther - apy ( see below ) [ 20 ] . Both autosomal recessive deficiencies of IFN regu - latory factor 7 ( IRF7 ) , located in 11p15 . 5 , including p . Pro364fs / p . Pro364f and p . Met371Val / p . Asp117Asn and autosomal dominant IRF7 including p . Arg7fs / WT , p . Gln185 * / WT , p . Pro246fs / WT , p . Arg369Gln / WT , p . Phe95Ser / WT deficiencies are found in ~ 3 . 5 % of severe COVID - 19 patients ( and also in life - threatening influenza - associated pneumonia ) but absent in asympto - matic / mild SARS - CoV - 2 infected patients [ 6 ] . Moreover , an analysis of Italian population has shown that 3 SNPs of the chemokine CC - motif receptor ( CCR ) 5 gene such as rs9845542 , rs12639314 , and rs35951367 ( this when characterized by genotype GT ) are weakly associ - ated to increased risk of development of severe COVID - 19 correlating with decreased lung expression of CCR5 [ 21 ] . HLA system SNPs and alleles Several SNPs and alleles of both human leukocyte anti - gen ( HLA ) class I and II ( respectively located in 6p22 . 1 and 6p21 . 32 ) increase the risk of severe COVID - 19 , although it is still now not fully clear the mechanism induced severe COVID - 19 HLA - mediated , growing evi - dence suggest that this can be induced by different SARS - CoV - 2 antigen presentation HLA - mediated that correlate with abnormal immune cells response [ 12 , 22 – 24 ] . Class I HLA alleles such as HLA - A * 11 : 01 , HLA - B * 51 : 01 , HLA - B * 54 , HLA - C * 14 : 02 , were found to be strongly correlated with increased risk of hospitalization due to SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 24 – 27 ] . In addition , the class I HLA - C * 04 : 01 allele is correlated with increased risk of development of COVID - 19 with double risk of onset acute respiratory failure needed intu - bation [ 28 ] . Moreover , patients with a decreased class II HLA - DR cluster 1 showed increased risk of developing severe COVID - 19 [ 22 , 28 ] , and in particular rs9271609 ( TC genotype ) of the HLA - DRB1 was weakly correlated with severe COVID - 19 [ 13 ] . Similarly , although there is not a direct correlation with the SARS - CoV - 2 infection , the rs660895 SNP ( located on 6p21 , genotype GA ) of the HLA - DRB1 and HLA - DRB5 are correlated with increased serum levels of IL - 6 [ 20 ] . Page 4 of 24 Scaramuzzo et al . Journal of Inflammation ( 2023 ) 20 : 11 ABO blood gene The ABO blood antigens have also been found to be associated with an increased inflammatory response to COVID - 19 . The O blood group was found to be less sus - ceptible to severe COVID - 19 particularly compared to the A blood group [ 29 – 32 ] . This is probably correlated to the presence of serum autoantibodies to A and B anti - gens in O group patients that may decrease SARS - CoV - 2 entrance into cells by binding to several components on the virus envelope . In addition , increased susceptibility of blood group A patients to severe COVID - 19 may be cor - related to increased ACE1 expression levels on lung epi - thelial cells [ 30 ] . Recent studies confirmed that the expression in the ABO gene locus ( located in 9q34 . 2 ) of specific SNPs such as rs657152 and rs9411378 are respectively strongly and weakly associated to an increased risk of severe COVID - 19 [ 33 , 34 ] . Finally , the rs48697960 SNP ( CT genotype ) within the fucosyltransferase 2 ( FUT2 ) gene which regulates expression of the ABO blood group antigens is weakly correlated with increased risk of severe COVID - 19 devel - opment [ 13 ] . Acquired risk factors for severe COVID‑19 Aging Age is a well - described risk factor for severe COVID - 19 outcomes . Importantly , concomitant comorbidities and underlying genetic and acquired diseases need to be considered when interpreting age - related risk fac - tors for severe COVID - 19 . Children are reported to be at similar risk of infection with SARS - CoV - 2 as com - pared to other age groups , however are more likely to develop asymptomatic or mild SARS - CoV - 2 infec - tion , and are less likely to require hospitalisation or need of mechanical ventilation [ 35 – 37 ] . Children also develop robust cellular and humoral immune responses to SARS - CoV - 2 which are sustained for > 12 months after infection , irrespective of COVID - 19 severity [ 38 ] . Comparatively , increasing age is positively correlated with ICU admission , mechanical ventilation , and severe COVID - 19 [ 39 ] , with case fatality dramatically increas - ing from 50 years onwards [ 40 , 41 ] . Severe pneumonia and acute lung injury were much more likely to occur in older patients [ 42 ] , with reduced circulating lym - phocytes and heightened circulating inflammatory bio - markers [ 40 ] . In line with human clinical observations , studies using golden hamsters have shown that older animals had dampened immune responses , impaired tissue repair responses and fewer germinal centre B cells resulting in lower neutralising antibody responses against SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 43 ] . Conversely , a study both ex vivo and in vitro has shown that SARS - CoV - 2 infection is correlated with increased expression in alveolar cells type 2 of several cell senescence markers including p16 INK . In addition , through a next - generation - sequencing analysis it was demonstrated that these senescent cells are correlated with increased risk to mediated SARS - CoV - 2 mutations during its replication [ 44 ] . Sex Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that sex dif - ferences play a prominent role in determining severe COVID - 19 and mortality outcomes . Males and females express varying levels of SARS - CoV - 2 entry receptors such as ACE2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 ( TMPRSS2 ) , which is often further confounded by addi - tional factors such as cigarette smoke ( CS ) exposure and increasing age [ 45 ] . Both males and females have been shown to be equally represented in terms of SARS - CoV - 2 infection burden , irrespective of variable ACE2 expres - sion [ 46 ] . Interestingly , males are much more likely to be admitted to intensive care unit ( ICU ) and have increased risk of mortality due to COVID - 19 [ 46 , 47 ] . Additional studies further support these findings , however they also reported that males were much more likely to have underlying chronic diseases such as systemic arterial hypertension , diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , renal failure , and congestive heart failure , suggesting that confounding disease cannot be entirely excluded as an additional risk factor [ 48 ] . Comparison of SARS - CoV - 2 viral burden in nasal swabs and saliva revealed no sex differences , how - ever males were found to have significantly elevated CXCL8 and IL - 18 pro - inflammatory mediators in plasma samples , likely contributing to severe COVID - 19 and increased mortality [ 49 ] . Cigarette smoke and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease While , smoking habit seems not be correlated with increased mortality of COVID - 19 patients , a study has shown that whilst smoking COVID - 19 patients ( n = 791 ) correlated with increased risk of complica - tions , including c - ARDS and acute respiratory fail - ure compared to never smokers COVID - 19 patients ( n = 5098 ) , there were not differences in terms of mor - tality [ 50 ] . CS is the main aetiological factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) development , which typically occurs after decades of chronic CS exposure [ 51 ] . COVID - 19 diagnosis in COPD patients is often associated with increased hospital admission , mechanical ventilation , severe disease features and higher mortality [ 52 ] , but there are contrasting data in literature . CS is known to upregulate ACE2 expression ; Page 5 of 24 Scaramuzzo et al . Journal of Inflammation ( 2023 ) 20 : 11 the main SARS - CoV - 2 viral entry receptor which is essential for infection and may ultimately predispose to elevated infection risk [ 53 ] . Recent work has shown that primary bronchial epithelial cells from COPD patients are much more susceptible to SARS - CoV - 2 infection than healthy individuals , due to increased expression of SARS - CoV - 2 entry receptors such as TMPRSS2 and cathepsin B , and that COPD cells had much higher pro - inflammatory cytokine responses and blunted type I IFN responses [ 54 ] . Moreover , another in vitro study analys - ing human bronchial epithelial cells , has confirmed the increased susceptibility to SARS - CoV - 2 infection in COPD patients compared healthy subjects through the increased expression of the ACE2 receptor that medi - ate SARS - CoV - 2 cell entry . In particular , the most sus - ceptible cells to the SARS - CoV - 2 entry were the globet cells that are increased in COPD patients [ 55 ] . COPD cells had 24 - fold increased viral burden compared to healthy subjects , reiterating the importance of height - ened SARS - CoV - 2 co - receptor expression in facilitat - ing infection [ 54 ] . Works from in vivo animal models is eagerly awaited . Diabetes mellitus DM is the most important risk factor for develop - ing severe COVID - 19 [ 56 ] . There are many studies that show increased risk of development severe COVID - 19 in patients with DM compared to COVID - 19 patients without this disease ; in addition , several evidence show how COVID - 19 mortality is negatively associated with glycaemic control both before and during the hospital stay . Moreover , higher serum levels of HbA1c are also positively correlated with an increased risk of mortality from COVID - 19 patients with DM [ 57 – 60 ] . Patients with DM have an increased expression of ACE2 in both lungs and endothelium that can increase chronic inflammation , impair the endothelial cell activation , enhance the pro - inflammatory response , and therefore determine a dys - function of the alveolar - capillary barrier [ 61 , 62 ] . Obesity Obesity is another risk factor for hospitalization rate and ICU admission due to COVID - 19 and a body mass index ( BMI ) > 40 has been found to be an independent risk fac - tor for mortality in COVID - 19 patients [ 63 – 66 ] . Obese adipocytes express high levels of ACE2 receptor , may increase IL - 6 circulating levels and induce a pro - throm - botic state . Moreover , impaired chest - wall elastance and decreased lung function can contribute to acute respira - tory failure [ 67 , 68 ] . Conversely , a retrospective study on German hospital - ized COVID - 19 patients has shown that obesity and in particular grade I obesity , did not increase the patient mortality [ 69 ] . Systemic arterial hypertension Systemic arterial hypertension increases the risk of severe COVID - 19 , need of invasive mechanical venti - lation and death [ 70 – 72 ] and this can be related to an unbalance of the renin – angiotensin – aldosterone system . In addition , patients with systemic arterial hypertension treated with ACE2 receptor blockers showed a decreased mortality due SARS - CoV - 2 infection compared to untreated patients with uncontrolled blood pressure values or treated with other forms of anti - hypertension medications [ 56 ] . Chronic kidney diseases Chronic kidney diseases also represent an important risk factor for severe COVID - 19 , hospitalization , and mortal - ity , but the molecular mechanism that induce increased COVID - 19 severity mediated by chronic kidney diseases are still not clear [ 73 ] . Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) is a well - known risk factor for severe COVID - 19 outcomes and increased mortality as compared to the general population [ 52 , 74 ] but there are contrasting data in the literature . IPF is also known to increase the risk for hospitalisation , critical care , acute kidney injury and need for mechanical ventilation in COVID - 19 patients [ 75 ] . IPF and COVID - 19 share simi - larities in disease features , such as stiffening of pulmonary tissue and impaired gas exchange [ 76 ] . To date , there has been no laboratory study which has investigated the causal relationship between IPF and severe COVID - 19 . Protective genetic factors for severe COVID‑19 As well as genetic susceptibility , several data demonstrated several factors correlated with decreasing risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection and with the development of severe dis - ease COVID - 19 and these are summarized in Table 1 . TMPRSS2 SNPs The SNP rs12329760 within the TMPRSS2 gene is cor - related with decreased susceptibility to COVID - 19 when the T allele is expressed as the C / T genotype [ 31 , 77 ] , and particularly as the T / T genotype . The latter genotype being characterized by further decreased susceptibility to COVID - 19 [ 78 ] . The rs12329760 SNP also correlated Page 6 of 24 Scaramuzzo et al . Journal of Inflammation ( 2023 ) 20 : 11 with a decreased risk of development of severe COVID - 19 , mediated through a decreased expression of the receptor for SARS - CoV - 2 along with a decreased affinity binding to SARS - CoV - 2 [ 7 ] . HLA system SNPs and alleles Despite there being very little data about class I and II HLA alleles correlated to decreased risk to develop - ment of COVID - 19 , a study has shown that the alleles HLA - A * 02 : 01 and HLA - A * 03 : 01 , only when express in homozygosity , are not correlated to severe COVID - 19 development [ 23 ] ; HLA - A * 68 : 02 was correlated to decreased risk to ICU admission in hospitalized COVID - 19 patients and in addition , HLA - B * 14 was correlated to decreased mortality in COVID - 19 patients [ 27 ] , however , the molecular mechanism is still not fully clear . Protective pro‑inflammatory mediators signalling A study evaluating a Spanish population has shown that the deletion of the CCR5 variation Δ32 ( rs333 ) , ( in homozygosis genotype ) is correlated to mild disease induced by SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 79 ] . Immune system dysregulation in the COVID‑19 pathogenesis Growing evidence shows that the development of severe COVID - 19 and of c - ARDS are determined by the dysreg - ulation of many components of the innate immune sys - tem , including alveolar macrophages , blood monocytes , neutrophils and complement [ 80 , 81 ] . While , further data are needed to better clarify the role of adaptative immunity in the pathogenesis of COVID - 19 and c - ARDS , several lines of evidence show that the three main com - ponents of the adaptive immune system , such as CD4 + T cells , CD8 + T cells , and B cells producing neutralizing antibodies , all contribute to controlling SARS - CoV - 2 infection during the acute phase and regulate immune memory [ 1 , 81 ] . Dysregulation of these components can induce a more severe clinical presentation [ 82 ] . In addi - tion , severe COVID - 19 patients exhibit a correlation to increased expression of several genes mediating activa - tion of inflammatory innate immune responses compared to both moderate and mild COVID - 19 patients [ 83 ] . This includes activation of : intracellular IFN and TLR signal - ling pathways ( Fig . 1 ) , signal transducer and activator of transcription ( STAT ) 3 and receptors expressed on mye - loid cells ( TREM1 ) to CXCL8 , IL - 6 and IL - 22 . Blood Blood neutrophils of COVID - 19 patients are repre - sented by a particular subpopulation characterized by enhanced expression of several gene correlated to IFNs pathways including interferon inducing protein ( IFI ) 44L , IFI44 , interferon - induced protein with tetratri - copeptide repeats ( IFITINIB1 ) and IFI6 when compared to blood neutrophils of healthy subjects , but also when compared to patients with bacterial ARDS [ 84 ] . A study has shown that blood neutrophils of severe / critical COVID - 19 patients ( n = 44 ) , were character - ized by several markers of immature and immuno - suppressive state including decreased surface CD13 expression and increased surface CCR5 expression , compared to blood neutrophils of patients with mild SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( n = 40 ) and to non - infected subjects ( n = 22 ) [ 85 ] . Similarly , another study has shown that COVID - 19 patients ( n = 27 ) are characterized by blood neutro - phils expressing increased levels of neutrophil activation markers , such as CD11b and CD66b compared to healthy subjects ( n = 12 ) . In addition , these neutrophils also expressed increased levels of CD47 that positively corre - lated to enhanced neutrophils survival [ 86 ] . In addition , blood neutrophils of COVID - 19 patients ( n = 15 ) when stimulated with phorbol 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) produced increased levels of reac - tive oxygen species ( ROS ) when compared with healthy subjects ; in addition , neutrophil ROS production was positively correlated with blood neutrophil levels in COVID - 19 patients . However , there was no difference in neutrophil ROS production when comparing neutrophils of COVID - 19 patients against patients with sepsis unre - lated to SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 87 ] . Whilst no significant differences were found in blood monocytes between severe ( n = 43 ) , moderate ( n = 16 ) and mild ( n = 27 ) COVID - 19 patients , severe patients did show a blood monocyte sub - population that mostly expressed decreased “nonclassical” CD14 Low CD16 High markers , whereas monocytes from mild / moderate patients expressed enhanced CD14 High CD16 High mark - ers . In addition , severe COVID - 19 patients showed increased blood neutrophil levels expressing an imma - ture phenotype characterized by CD10 Low CD101 - and elevated release of calcium binding protein ( S100 ) A8 / 9 [ 88 ] . Moreover , COVID - 19 patients may have a reduced number of circulating monocytes levels [ 89 ] . Profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from COVID - 19 patients ( n = 125 ) , mild infected SARS - CoV - 2 patients ( n = 36 ) and healthy subjects ( n = 60 ) helped to identify three different immunotypes correlated with disease severity . The phenotype that correlated with the most severe disease was characterized by highly activated CD4 + and CD8 + T - cells and enhanced plasmablast responses . The second phenotype that correlated less with disease severity was characterized by decreased CD4 + T cell activation and enhanced proliferation of B memory cells . The third phenotype was unrelated Page 7 of 24 Scaramuzzo et al . Journal of Inflammation ( 2023 ) 20 : 11 to severe disease and was characterized by a low or an absence T and B cell activation [ 90 ] . One of the first studies on the role of the adaptative immune system in COVID - 19 showed reduced blood levels of both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in COVID - 19 patients ( n = 522 ) compared to healthy subjects ( n = 40 ) [ 91 ] . Blood total T cells levels negatively correlated with severity and mortality in COVID - 19 patients and those admitted to ICU ( n = 43 ) had further decreased total blood T cells levels compared to COVID - 19 patients not admitted to ICU ( n = 479 ) . Another study con - firmed these findings where blood levels of both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells from severe COVID - 19 patients ( n = 11 ) were decreased compared to moderate COVID - 19 patients ( n = 10 ) [ 92 ] . These findings correlated with decreased serum IFN levels produced by CD4 + T cells . Aging is a well - known important risk factor for increased severity of COVID - 19 and is characterized by changes in adaptative immunity with a decreased T cell response to viral infection , a decreased gen - eration of CD3 + and naïve T cells , inversion of blood CD4 + : CD8 + T cell ratio through decreasing blood CD8 + T cells , and enhanced proliferation of regulatory T cells ( Treg ) [ 93 ] that are immune - suppressive cells . Interestingly , a cohort study of 12 hospitalized COVID - 19 patients showed than an enhanced and rapid blood T cell activation and response against SARS - CoV - 2 infection was correlated with reduced disease severity and length of hospitalization [ 94 ] . Moreover , a recent study has shown that aging can alter subset clustering of both B and T cells , in par - ticular , hospitalized COVID - 19 patients > 70 years of age ( n = 10 ) , when compared to hospitalized COVID - 19 patients < 60 years of age ( n = 7 ) , showed decreased blood levels of both CD8 + naïve T cells ( CD8 + , CCR7 + , CD45RA + , CD45R0 - , CD27 + , CD28 + ) and CD4 + memory T cells ( CD4 + , CCR7 + , CD54RA - , CD45R0 + , CD27 + , CD28 + ) , these were Fig . 1 IFNs signalling pathway activation mediated by intracellular TLRs following viral infection . Several intracellular TLRs such as TLR - 3 and - 7 can recognize viral RNA of SARS - CoV - 2 , activating several intracellular pro - inflammatory pathways including NF - κB and inducing transcription and release of several pro - inflammatory mediators ( including IL - 1β and IL - 6 ) forming the so termed “cytokines storm” . Beetwen these mediators , also anti - viral cytokines such as IFNα , IFNβ , IFNγ can be released . The mediators IFNAR1 , - 2 and JAK1 , - 2 , respectively can activate intracellular anti - inflammatory pathways involving STAT1 , - 2 , mediating expression of ISGs .

Journal of Inflammation ( 2023 ) 20 : 11 also characterized by a decreased proliferation index . Conversely , hospitalized COVID - 19 patients > 70 years of age showed increased blood plasmablast B cells ( CD19 low , CD20 - , IgD - , IgM - , CD80 + , CD38 + ) , com - pared to hospitalized COVID - 19 patients < 60 years of age [ 95 ] . Serum biomarkers Patients with prominent B cell responses had increased severity and risk of mortality . In particular , in paediat - ric COVID - 19 patients , who are typically characterized by better prognosis compared to adults / older patients , both severe ( n = 16 ) and non - severe ( n = 31 ) were char - acterized by decreased B cell response compared to both severe ( n = 19 ) and non - severe ( n = 13 ) adult patients , showing both decreased serum levels of antibodies against SARS - CoV - 2 , but in addition different antibodies class and type , where paediatric patients showed mainly production of IgG against Spike protein , while adult patients were characterized by production of IgG , IgM and IgA against both Spike protein and nucleocapsid pro - teins [ 96 ] . Moreover , hospitalized COVID - 19 patients ( n = 376 ) had increased serum levels of both IgG and IgA anti - Spike and anti - nucleocapsid antibodies levels compared to asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infected patients [ 97 ] . In addition , IgG and IgA anti - Spike and anti - nucleocapsid antibodies levels positively correlated with COVID - 19 severity . The subtypes of the antibodies are critical and the antibodies able to targeting the class 4 epitope , can bind the conserved receptor binding domain supersite and sterically inhibit ACE2 interactions are most effec - tive [ 98 ] . Finally , several data have shown that in hospitalized COVID - 19 patients , but not in asymptomatic / mild SARS - CoV - 2 patients , the presence and increased levels of one or more serum auto - antibodies [ including anti - phosphatidylserine / prothrombin ( aPS / PT ) IgM and IgG , anticardiolipin IgM and IgA , and anti - β2 - glycoprotein 1 IgG positively correlated with increased severity of COVID - 19 mortality [ 99 – 101 ] , and , in vitro , to increased neutrophil extracellular traps ( NETs ) [ 101 ] . Bronchoalveolar lavage biomarkers Bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) in severe / critical COVID - 19 patients ( n = 28 ) is characterized by increased neu - trophil levels and decreased lymphocytes and alveolar macrophages levels , compared to mild / moderate COVID - 19 patients ( n = 5 ) [ 102 ] . In addition , BAL alveolar mac - rophages from severe / critical COVID - 19 patients showed an increased surface expression of several markers , such as ficolin - 1 and secreted phosphoprotein 1 ( SPP1 ) . Moreover , the increased expression of fatty acid - binding protein 4 ( FABP4 ) correlated with mild / moderate COVID - 19 disease [ 103 ] . Lung tissue Analysis of postmortem lung biopsies taken from 7 patients who died from COVID - 19 has shown that the main immune cells localized in alveolar space of all these patients were represented by alveolar macrophages and T - cell lymphocytes . Interestingly , biopsy samples from 3 of these patients were also characterized by increased localization of neutrophils in the alveolar space [ 104 ] . Additional studies on patients who died following COVID - 19 infection also showed that lung tissue was characterized by an increased infiltration of alveolar mac - rophages [ 105 ] . Conversely other analysis have found an increased infiltration of CD8 + T - lymphocytes [ 106 ] . Finally , more recent and robust data focusing immune inflammatory cells expressed in post - mortem lung tissue of COVID - 19 patients has confirmed that levels of several immune cells can change between COVID - 19 patients . However , the immune cell populations that have the greatest increase and prevalence in the interstitial space and alveolar space are represented by CD3 + , CD4 + , CD8 + and CD45 + lymphocytes and macrophages [ 107 ] . In particular , lung tissue levels of macrophages and CD8 + T - cells positively correlated with diffuse alveolar damage ( DAD ) in COVID - 19 patients who had died from the disease [ 108 ] . Pro‑inflammatory signalling pathways in COVID‑19 pathogenesis Blood As shown previously , severe COVID - 19 patients are characterized by increased blood neutrophil levels . Addi - tional studies have confirmed this correlation and in addition shown that in severe COVID - 19 , blood neutro - phils are characterized by an altered expression though epigenic control ( hyper - or hypomethylation ) of several genes correlated to viral defense such as ; type I IFNs , 2 - prime , 5 - prime oligoadenylate synthetases ( OAS ) 1 , - 2 , IFIT3 , IRF7 , TRIM2 [ 109 ] . Patients with severe / critical COVID - 19 were also char - acterized by an increased activation of TLR2 pathway with enhanced expression of TLR2 RNA in the circulat - ing mononuclear cells , when compared with moderate COVID - 19 or healthy subjects . In addition , these data were confirmed in vivo since mice treated with a TLR2 inhibitor did not develop severe disease after SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 110 ] . A study by Kunadi et al . showed that blood CD8 + T cells from infected SARS - CoV - 2 patients ( n = 17 non hospitalized , n = 13 hospitalized non - ICU , n = 9 ICU patients ) had different grades of activation that Page 9 of 24 Scaramuzzo et al . Journal of Inflammation ( 2023 ) 20 : 11 positively correlated with disease severity [ 111 ] . The most active CD8 + T cells had impaired IFN - responses and cytotoxicity , expressed CD38 , CD279 and HLADR and a cluster of several pro - inflammatory genes char - acterized by increased release of mediators such as ; tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) α , IFNγ , CCL3 , CCL4 , CXCL1 and CXCL2 [ 9 ] . Serum pro‑inflammatory mediators Serum NETs levels are increased in SARS - CoV - 2 infected patients ( n = 33 ) as compared to healthy controls ( n = 17 ) and their levels positively correlated with thrombosis risk and disease severity , since higher levels were found in patients intubated or that died [ 112 ] . In COVID - 19 , increased levels of IL - 6 support the differentiation of pro - inflammatory Th17 cells and a decrease of the T cells , such as CD4 + T cells , CD8 + T cells and natural killer ( NK ) cells [ 113 ] . This induced lym - phopenia prevents the production of antiviral antibodies by the adaptive immune system , and delays or precludes the clearance of the virus . Literature data also shows that complement pathway is enhancing activated in SARS - CoV - 2 infection and positively correlated with disease severity [ 80 ] . Serum C5a and C5aR levels were increased in COVID - 19 patients ( n = 82 ) , compared to healthy subjects ( n = 10 ) and C5a / C5aR serum levels positively correlated with disease severity where the most severe COVID - 19 patients ( n = 28 ) showed the most increased levels com - pared to moderate ( n = 34 ) and mild ( n = 10 ) patients [ 114 ] . Serum Cb5 levels were also increased in COVID - 19 patients ( n = 134 ) , compared to hospitalized patients with influenza ( n = 54 ) . Moreover , further increased serum Cb5 levels were found in ICU COVID - 19 patients ( n = 72 ) compared to non - ICU COVID - 19 patients ( n = 62 ) and positively correlated with increased mortal - ity risk [ 115 ] . Similarly , another study showed that serum levels of several complement subunits such as C5b , C5a , C3bc and C4d were increased in hospitalized COVID - 19 patients ( n = 39 ) compared to healthy subjects . How - ever , serum C5b and C4d levels were further increased or tended to increase during hospitalization in COVID - 19 patients with acute respiratory failure ( n = 23 ) [ 116 ] . Recently , increased complement levels and activation ( C3a fragment ) were found in the lung tissue of criti - cally ill ( n = 24 ) , compared to non - critically ill ( n = 49 ) , COVID - 19 patients [ 117 ] . BAL pro‑inflammatory mediators BAL alveolar macrophages from severe COVID - 19 patients ( n = 23 ) were characterized by an increased production and release of several pro - inflammatory mediators , such as IL - 1β , IL - 6 , CCL3 and CCL4 and increased expression of IL - 1R and S100A8 / 9 proteins , compared to those from mild COVID - 19 patients [ 118 ] . In addition , severe COVID - 19 patients BAL alveolar macrophages ( n = 88 ) are characterized by a cluster acti - vation , involving genes encoding several pro - inflamma - tory mediators such as CCL7 , CCL8 and CCL13 , that can mediate recruitment and activation of monocytes and T cells [ 119 ] . An alveolar macrophage sub - population characterized by increased secretion of CCL8 , CXCL10 , CXCL11 , and IL - 6 and a blood monocyte sub - population character - ized by increased secretion of IL - 1β , CCL20 , CXCL2 , CXCL3 , CCL3 , CCL4 , and TNFα were found in the BAL of severe COVID - 19 patients ( n = 38 ) or patients that were characterized by a severe progression of COVID - 19 ( n = 54 ) [ 120 ] . In a cohort study of severe COVID - 19 patients ( n = 9 ) it was shown that their BAL contained a clonal expansion of a sub - population of memory Th17 cells that increase the secretion of several pro - inflammatory mediators , such as IL - 17A and granulocyte – macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) [ 121 ] . Lung tissue pro‑inflammatory biomarkers Analysis of postmortem lung tissue taken from patients who died from COVID - 19 showed that SARS - CoV - 2 infection caused diffuse alveolar damage ( DAD ) char - acterized by formation of hyaline membranes in lung parenchyma and perivascular lung vessels inflammation inducing intravasal fibrin thrombi / microthrombi [ 122 – 124 ] . Moreover , DAD extension was positively correlated with male sex and premortem serum LDH levels [ 106 ] , while large vessels thrombosis and microthrombi of lung vessels were found in deceased COVID - 19 patients who had a longer average disease duration compared to COVID - 19 patients who died after a short disease dura - tion [ 125 ] . Furthermore , deceased COVID - 19 patients had increased infiltration of alveolar macrophages into the lung along with increased expression of several pro - inflammatory mediators such as IL - 6 [ 105 ] . Similar to “classical” ARDS [ 126 ] , c - ARDS is character - ized by a specific pro - inflammatory mediator profile in several lung compartments that represent promising bio - markers for diagnosis , stratification of disease severity , prognosis and response to therapy . Lung epithelial and alveolar cell biomarkers in c‑ARDS Different lung epithelial and alveolar biomarkers have been found in COVID - 19 patients , which could help diagnosis and monitoring of patients [ 127 , 128 ] . Growing Page 10 of 24 Scaramuzzo et al . Journal of Inflammation ( 2023 ) 20 : 11 evidence shows that several proteins expressed by the epithelial cells of the lower airways in COVID - 19 cor - relate with acute lung injury and potential fibrotic evo - lution of both lung epithelial and alveolar cells . These include Krebs von den Lungen - 6 ( KL - 6 ) , surfactant pro - teins ( SP - A , SP - B , SP - C , SP - D ) , and club cell secretory protein 16 ( CC16 ) [ 127 ] , representing potential biomark - ers in acute SARS - CoV - 2 pulmonary infection [ 129 ] . Krebs von den Lungen‑6 Serum KL - 6 levels are increased during severe , but not in mild , SARS - CoV - 2 infection . This can be explained by epithelial cell injuries that can induce leakage in the air - blood barrier , increasing serum levels of KL - 6 [ 127 ] . Thus , KL - 6 represents a potential biomarker of severe cases and correlates with fibrotic evolution of lung paren - chyma but has low sensitivity [ 130 ] . Indeed , increased serum KL - 6 levels were found in severe COVID - 19 ( n = 12 ) compared to mild SARS - CoV - 2 infected patients ( n = 10 ) [ 131 ] . Another study confirmed increased serum KL - 6 levels in COVID - 19 patients ( n = 21 ) compared to healthy subjects ( n = 43 ) . In addition , serum KL - 6 lev - els positively correlated with disease severity in terms of decreasing oxygen partial pressure ( PaO2 ) and SARS - CoV - 2 induced pneumonia as assessed by chest CT scan [ 132 ] . In particular , the presence and extension of lung opac - ity at lung CT scan in SARS - CoV - 2 infected patients correlated with increased KL - 6 levels compared to SARS - CoV - 2 infected patients without lung opacity [ 133 ] . Interestingly , serum KL - 6 levels were increased in COVID - 19 patients ( n = 83 ) compared to healthy sub - jects ( n = 70 ) , positively correlating with severity , but not when compared with serum levels in patients with other lung interstitial diseases ( n = 31 ) including IPF and sar - coidosis [ 134 ] . Moreover , increased serum KL - 6 levels have been found in severe COVID - 19 patients ( n = 21 ) as compared to non - severe ones ( n = 54 ) and serum KL - 6 levels further increased after 1 week from diagnosis in severe patients [ 135 ] . Similarly , although serum KL - 6 levels were increased in hospitalized COVID - 19 patients with SARS - CoV - 2 - mediated pulmonary fibrosis ( n = 12 ) compared to hospitalized COVID - 19 patients without pulmonary fibrosis ( n = 10 ) , serum KL - 6 levels tended to decrease after hospital discharge in a time - dependent manner correlating with the resolution of pulmonary fibrosis [ 131 ] . Another study confirmed increased serum KL - 6 levels in severe COVID - 19 patients ( n = 36 ) , com - pared to moderate ( n = 28 ) and mild ( n = 49 ) patients , demonstrating that serum KL - 6 levels positively corre - lated with an increased risk of developing lung fibrosis [ 136 ] . Surfactant proteins Many studies have evaluated levels of surfactant pro - teins ( SP ) in serum during both acute pulmonary diseases ( such as “classical” ARDS ) and chronic lung dis - eases ( such as COPD and IPF ) [ 127 ] . Growing evidence shows that serum SPs levels are increased in COVID - 19 patients and correlate with disease severity , suggesting that SPs may be useful biomarkers in COVID - 19 . In par - ticular , SP - D seems to have a key role in pathogenesis of c - ARDS correlating with COVID - 19 severity [ 137 ] . Stud - ies measuring SP - D after SARS - CoV - 1 and SARS - CoV - 2 infections found higher levels in both disease and cor - related with the disease severity [ 138 ] . Moreover , SP - D serum levels are higher in COVID - 19 patients ( n = 88 ) as compared to healthy subjects ( n = 20 ) and are furtherly increased in those with poor prognosis ( n = 33 ) [ 139 ] . Finally , due to the key role of SPs in pathogenesis of severe COVID - 19 , use of systemic or inhaled exogenous SPs as therapeutic options to prevent the most severe COVID - 19 form has been proposed and currently there are several promising data in vivo evaluating effective - ness of these compounds [ 140 ] . Club cell secretory protein 16 There are several studies showing that serum CC16 levels are positively correlated to inflammatory damage impair - ing the alveolar - capillary barrier especially when induced by acute lung injury ( ALI ) or “classical ARDS” represent - ing a biomarker correlated to “classical ARDS” severity [ 127 , 141 , 142 ] . Although data on the role of CC16 in COVID - 19 and c - ARDS are poor , serum CC16 protein levels are increased in COVID - 19 and c - ARDS [ 143 ] . Soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products Levels of the soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products ( sRAGE ) in serum are increased in sev - eral inflammatory disease associated to lung epithelial injury , such as bacterial infection , COPD , lung fibrosis and “classical” ARDS [ 126 , 144 ] . However , there is limited data on the role of sRAGE in c - ARDS . One study showed that serum sRAGE levels are increased during SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( n = 164 ) compared to healthy subjects ( n = 15 ) , and positively correlated with COVID - 19 sever - ity , the need for mechanical ventilation and / or high flow oxygen therapy and increased mortality [ 145 ] . However , there were no significant differences between COVID - 19 patients and patients with pneumonia unrelated to SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( n = 23 ) . Similarly , another study showed that increases in serum sRAGE levels in COVID - 19 patients during hospitalization correlated with increased risk of ICU admission and mortality [ 146 ] . Conversely , another study showed increased serum Page 11 of 24 Scaramuzzo et al . Journal of Inflammation ( 2023 ) 20 : 11 sRAGE levels in asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infected patients ( n = 23 ) compared to COVID - 19 patients with pneumonia ( n = 35 ) [ 147 ] . Finally , a recent study showed that serum sRAGE levels were increased in severe COVID - 19 patients in need of mechanical ventilation ( n = 73 ) compared to those who did not ( n = 152 ) . In addition , sRAGE levels tended to decrease during hospitalization and could potentially be an early biomarker of COVID - 19 severity [ 148 ] . Lung endothelial cell biomarkers in c‑ARDS As previously reported , in COVID - 19 patients , the pathogenesis of disease is related to immune responses to SARS - CoV - 2 , which is responsible for direct tissue dam - age , with the interplay of the endothelium , complement activation and pro - coagulable states playing a significant role during the later stages [ 149 ] . Moreover , increased data obtained through several post - mortem studies analysing lung tissue of deceased patients showed that SARS - CoV - 2 infection is correlated to coagulopathy inducing the formation of microthrombi in lung tissue as well as in extra - pulmonary organs [ 107 , 150 ] . Similar to “classical” ARDS [ 126 ] there are several mol - ecules that have been identified as endothelial dysfunc - tion biomarkers in c - ARDS , such as ACE2 receptor , von Willebrand factor ( vWF ) , angiopoietin - 2 ( Ang2 ) and plasminogen activator inhibitor ( PAI ) - 1 . These tend to be increased in the serum of COVID - 19 patients compared to healthy subjects and correlate with disease severity and mortality [ 151 ] . In particular , SARS - CoV - 2 entry into endothelial cells induces a prothrombotic status through the decreased levels of ACE2 and the increased release of coagula - tion factors such as tissue factor ( TF ) , Ang2 , fibrin and increased platelet adhesion mediated by direct virus - induced endothelial damage . In addition , accumulation of PAI - 1 and Ang2 decreases fibrinolysis activity which in turn mediates a vasoconstriction effect [ 152 ] ( Fig . 2 ) . Thus , these molecules may be used to identify patients with risk factors for c - ARDS and enable better clini - cal stratification following diagnosis , considering that endothelial biomarkers are significantly higher in patients Fig . 2 Pro - thrombotic status induced by SARS - CoV - 2 infection . SARS - CoV - 2 can bind endothelial ACE2 receptor inducing downregulation . Decreased levels of ACE2 induce decreased levels of Ang1 and - 7 and consequently vasoconstriction . Moreover , Ang2 tends to accumulate inducing vasoconstriction and increased levels of PAI - 1 and thus , decreased fibrinolysis . Conversely , endothelial damage SARS - CoV - 2 induced , mediate increased levels of TF inducing increased fibrin levels and increased levels of vWF and P - selectin mediating enhanced platelet adhesion .

Journal of Inflammation ( 2023 ) 20 : 11 requiring high - flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation at ICU admission [ 153 ] . In addition , growing data shows that endothelial dysfunction during COVID - 19 has a key role in the pathogenesis of several thrombotic complica - tions such as myocardial infarction , stroke and pulmo - nary embolism [ 151 , 154 ] . Biomarker levels of endothelial injury such as Ang2 are increased in c - ARDS , probably because endothelial damage may be predominant in the pathogenesis of severe forms of ARDS [ 155 ] . Conse - quently , defining the molecular mechanisms of endothe - lial dysfunction , could have diagnostic , prognostic and therapeutic implications [ 156 ] . ACE2 receptor Growing evidence shows that a correlation exists between SARS - CoV - 2 endothelial damage , clini - cal manifestations , and organ failure , reflecting the impact of high immune inflammatory responses [ 156 , 157 ] , although some studies found similar ACE2 levels in SARS - CoV - 2 infected patients ( n = 24 ) and healthy subjects ( n = 61 ) [ 158 ] . Both lung tissue and serum ACE2 levels were increased in severe COVID - 19 patients with c - ARDS ( n = 15 ) compared to healthy subjects ( n = 13 ) . How - ever , both ACE2 levels were also increased in patients with “classical” ARDS , showing no significant differ - ences with COVID - 19 patients [ 159 ] . Another study showed that serum ACE2 levels were increased in COVID - 19 patients with c - ARDS ( n = 68 ) compared to those without c - ARDS ( n = 21 ) [ 160 ] . Similarly , serum ACE2 levels were increased in critical ( n = 110 ; mean SOFA score 11 ) compared to non - critical ( n = 66 , mean SOFA score 4 ) COVID - 19 patients , but also patients with severe sepsis ( n = 32 ) . In addition , increased serum ACE2 levels were found in critical COVID - 19 patients who died ( n = 86 ) compared to survivors ( n = 24 ) [ 161 ] . Moreover , autoantibodies against ACE2 positively cor - related with severity of SARS - CoV - 2 infection and they were higher in moderate ( n = 68 ) compared to mild ( n = 31 ) COVID - 19 patients , and were further increased in severe COVID - 19 patients ( n = 20 ) [ 162 ] . Von Willebrand factor In “classical” ARDS , serum vWF levels are increased and positively correlate with risk of mortality [ 126 ] . Grow - ing evidence shows that both vWF and thrombospon - din type 1 motif member ( ADAMTS ) 13 have a key role in thrombus formation and organ failure in COVID - 19 patients [ 163 ] . Decreased serum ADAMTS13 levels correlate with increased hospitalization risk in COVID - 19 patients and poor outcomes [ 149 ] . Serum vWF levels and ADAMTS13 activity are positively and negatively correlated with COVID - 19 severity , respectively . Severe COVID - 19 patients ( needed for mechanical ventilation , n = 19 ) showed the greatest increase in serum vWF lev - els and decreases in ADAMTS13 activity compared to moderate ( needed for high flow oxygen therapy , n = 17 ) and mild ( needed for low - flow oxygen therapy , n = 14 ) patients [ 164 ] . Similarly , serum vWF levels in COVID - 19 patients ( n = 102 ) compared to healthy subjects ( n = 26 ) is associated with severity and ICU admis - sion ( n = 17 ) . Moreover , deceased COVID - 19 patients ( n = 25 ) showed the greatest increase in serum vWF levels , as compared to hospitalized COVID - 19 patients with ( n = 33 ) and without oxygen therapy ( n = 27 ) . In addition , serum ADAMTS13 activity tended to nega - tively correlate with COVID - 19 severity , with the great - est decreases in serum ADAMTS13 activity being found in deceased patients [ 165 ] . These findings were confirmed by another study show - ing that serum vWF levels were increased in COVID - 19 patients admitted to ICU ( n = 32 ) compared to non - ICU COVID - 19 patients ( n = 32 ) , whereas serum ADAMTS13 levels were decreased and negatively correlated with patient mortality and SOFA score [ 166 ] . Nevertheless , Doevelaar et al . did not find any differ - ence in ADAMTS13 levels between healthy subjects ( n = 30 ) and COVID - 19 patients ( n = 75 ) . However , the ADAMST13 / vWF ratio tended to decrease in COVID - 19 patients compared to healthy controls , negatively corre - lating with severity disease [ 167 ] . Levels of both serum vWF and its multimers were increased in SARS - CoV - 2 infected patients ( n = 127 ) compared to healthy subjects ( n = 23 ) . Moreover , these levels positively correlated with COVID - 19 severity where critical COVID - 19 patients ( n = 89 ) had the most increased levels compared to non - critical ( n = 96 ) and outpatients ( n = 23 ) COVID - 19 patients [ 168 ] . Another study showed that serum vWF levels in severe COVID - 19 patients admitted to ICU ( n = 28 ) tended to increase during the first days of hospitalization and to then decrease after the acute phase , until 3 months of convalescence following ICU discharge . However , severe COVID - 19 patients who died in ICU ( n = 3 ) had signifi - cantly higher vWF levels at ICU admission that did not decrease during hospitalization , although these findings were based on low patient numbers [ 169 ] . Serum vWF levels at the time of hospital admission correlates with different grades of COVID - 19 severity ( mild , moderate and severe / critical ; n = 333 ) , and with increased risk of mortality during hospital stay [ 170 ] . These findings were confirmed also by Thomas et al . who found serum vWF levels being correlated with COVID - 19 severity showing different levels in severe ( n = 36 ) , moderate ( n = 36 ) and mild ( n = 34 ) COVID - 19 patients Page 13 of 24 Scaramuzzo et al . Journal of Inflammation ( 2023 ) 20 : 11 [ 171 ] , with vWF levels independently associated with mortality . Finally , a study performed on lung tissue of deceased COVID - 19 patients ( n = 9 ) also found increased tissue expression of vWF [ 172 ] . Plasminogen activator inhibitor‑1 Serum PAI - 1 levels positively correlate with poor prog - nosis and mortality in ALI / “classical” ARDS [ 126 ] . However , currently there is limited data on the role of PAI - 1 in the pathogenesis of c - ARDS . One study showed that serum PAI - 1 levels were increased in COVID - 19 patients admitted to the hospital compared to less severe COVID - 19 patients , and levels positively correlated with mortality [ 173 ] . Endothelial cell adhesion molecules Increased levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule ( VCAM ) - 1 , ICAM - 1 , P - selectin and E - selectin were found in lung oedema and serum from patients with “classical” ARDS . Although these molecules seem to have a role in the pathogenesis of COVID - 19 correlat - ing with disease severity and thrombosis development , their pathways of involvement are still unclear [ 174 ] . First reports have shown that serum VCAM - 1 and ICAM - 1 levels were increased in COVID - 19 patients ( n = 36 ) , as compared to healthy subjects ( n = 16 ) , positively correlat - ing with disease severity and tending to decrease during convalescence [ 175 ] . However , although another study confirmed the increased levels of VCAM - 1 in COVID - 19 patients ( n = 14 ) compared to healthy subjects ( n = 14 ) , others adhesion molecules such as ICAM - 1 and P - selec - tin did not differ between these groups [ 176 ] . Another study showed that in the serum of COVID - 19 patients ( n = 250 ) VCAM - 1 and ICAM - 1 levels positively corre - lated with SARS - CoV - 2 RNAemia . Moreover , increasing serum VCAM - 1 levels in COVID - 19 patients during hos - pitalization correlated with increased risk of ICU admis - sion and mortality [ 146 ] . In severe COVID - 19 patients admitted to ICU ( n = 38 ) , increased levels of ICAM - 1 and E - selectin , but not VCAM - 1 or P - selectin , were found in COVID - 19 patients who died during hospi - talization ( n = 10 ) , compared to survivors ( n = 28 ) [ 160 ] . Both P - and E - selectin levels were increased in the serum of COVID - 19 patients ( n = 103 ) compared to healthy controls , and a further increase was found in those who developed thrombosis ( n = 35 ) compared to those who did not ( n = 68 ) . Moreover , increased serum sVCAM - 1 levels were independently associated with longer dura - tion of mechanical ventilation [ 177 ] . In contrast , a study of lung tissue from patients who died from COVID - 19 ( n = 9 ) showed a reduced local expression of ICAM - 1 , VCAM - 1 , E - selectin , and P - selectin [ 172 ] . Neo‑angiogenic proteins Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) and Ang2 drive neo - angiogenesis and vascular formation , are upregulated during inflammatory responses , and cor - relate with mortality in both COVID - 19 and “classical” ARDS [ 178 ] . Several studies showed how VEGF / Ang2 axis is involved in both “classical” ARDS and c - ARDS pathogenesis [ 126 , 179 ] . These data show that increased serum levels of both VEGF and Ang2 positively correlate with increased ARDS severity and risk of mortality [ 126 ] . Serum Ang2 levels were also increased in severe COVID - 19 patients needing mechanical ventilation ( n = 73 ) as compared to patients that did not need it ( n = 152 ) . However , increases in Ang2 levels started 3 days after hospitalization representing a late biomarker of COVID - 19 severity [ 148 ] . Moreover , increased serum levels of Ang2 were found in patients with c - ARDS ( n = 31 ) com - pared to hospitalized COVID - 19 patients without ARDS ( n = 12 ) ; serum Ang2 levels were positively correlated to severity of disease and mortality . In addition , lung autopsy of deceased patients showed that Ang2 levels correlated with microthrombi development and necrotic lung endothelial cell death [ 180 ] . Serum pro‑inflammatory mediators as biomarkers of c‑ARDS The hallmark of COVID - 19 pathogenesis is an unre - strained and abnormal over - production of pro - inflam - matory mediators . This so - called “cytokine storm” ( Fig . 3 ) is characterized by increased levels of cytokines and chemokines including GM - CSF , IL - 2 , IL - 6 , TNFα , CCL2 , CCL3 and CXCL10 that further worsen inflammation . One possible explanation is that inflammatory proteins , including IL - 6 , are part of both an inflammatory loop and host responses to the infection , similar to other conditions like endocarditis and sepsis [ 1 , 181 ] . The level of cytokine storm , as well as lymphopenia , are considered biomarkers of COVID - 19 , and are commonly used to predict the sub - sequent disease severity and mortality [ 182 ] . As a result , guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID - 19 ( first published in January 2020 ) recommended an early cytokine levels monitoring to reduce mortality [ 183 ] . One of the first studies to evaluate the serum cytokine storm in COVID - 19 patients showed that several pro - inflam - matory mediator levels , such as TNFα , IL - 2 , IL - 7 , IL - 10 , G - CSF , CXCL10 , CCL2 and CCL3 , were increased in ICU ( n = 13 ) compared to non - ICU COVID - 19 patients ( n = 28 ) [ 184 ] . This was confirmed in a bigger sample by Diao et al . who evaluated COVID - 19 patients ( n = 522 ) and found increased levels of IL - 6 , IL - 10 , and TNFα com - pared to healthy subjects ( n = 40 ) [ 91 ] . They positively correlated with severity and mortality in COVID - 19 Page 14 of 24 Scaramuzzo et al . Journal of Inflammation ( 2023 ) 20 : 11 patients admitted to ICU ( n = 43 ) compared to non - ICU admitted patients ( n = 479 ) . Similarly , another study con - firmed that several serum pro - inflammatory mediators including IL - 2R , IL - 6 , IL - 10 , and TNFα are increased in severe ( n = 11 ) compared to moderate ( n = 10 ) COVID - 19 patients , while serum IFNγ levels were decreased nega - tively correlating with disease severity [ 92 ] . Increased serum IL - 6 levels were found in non - surviving ( n = 54 ) compared to surviving ( n = 137 ) COVID - 19 patients [ 185 ] . Similarly , serum IL - 6 , CXCL8 , TNFα levels were increased in hospitalized COVID - 19 patients ( n = 1484 ) compared to non - infected by SARS - CoV - 2 ( n = 257 ) and serum levels of these pro - inflammatory mediators were positively correlated with mortality [ 186 ] . SARS - CoV - 2 infection induced the cytokine storm development driv - ing the pathogenesis of several severe manifestations of COVID - 19 such as c - ARDS , thromboembolic diseases , encephalitis , acute kidney injury and vasculitis [ 93 ] . Nev - ertheless , another study showed that in paediatric / young COVID - 19 patients ( n = 65 , < 24 years ) who generally suf - fer less severe disease there were increased serum levels of IFNγ and IL - 17A but not of IL - 6 and TNFα protein com - pared to adult COVID - 19 patients ( n = 65 ) . In addition , serum IFNγ levels were negatively correlated to disease severity [ 187 ] . Another study has confirmed these data showing that serum levels of several pro - inflammatory mediators such as IL - 6 , CXCL8 and TNFα and also serum NETs levels are increased in COVID - 19 patients ( n = 27 ) , compared to healthy subjects ( n = 12 ) [ 86 ] . IFNγ serum levels in SARS - CoV - 2 infected patients are also closely related to the development of clinical symptoms , causing flu - like symptoms as general malaise , headaches , fever and fatigue , but increased serum INFγ levels is usually correlated to non - severe COVID - 19 [ 188 ] . Serum CCL2 , CCL3 , CCL7 , CXCL9 , CXCL10 , IL - 1β and IL - 1Ra levels increased in critical COVID - 19 patients ( n = 11 ) when compared to both severe COVID - 19 patients ( n = 25 ) and moderate COVID - 19 patients ( n = 14 ) . Moreover , serum levels of these pro - inflamma - tory mediators were positively correlated to risk develop - ment and severity of acute respiratory failure [ 189 ] . Fig . 3 Immune cells involved in the development of a “cytokines storm” and severe COVID - 19 . Both innate and adaptative immune cells are involved in secretion of several pro - inflammatory mediators ( including IL - 1β and IL - 6 ) forming the so termed “cytokines storm” . This induces alveolar damage , vascular endothelial damage and increased pro - thrombotic factors mediating micro - thrombi development . On the other hand , the “cytokine storm” can induce recruitment and activation of others lung immune cells maintaining the pro - inflammatory status . Abbreviations : AM : Alveolar macrophage ; IL : interleukin ; LYM : lymphocyte ; NEU : neutrophil ; PMN : polymorphonuclear Page 15 of 24 Scaramuzzo et al . Journal of Inflammation ( 2023 ) 20 : 11 A recent study has also showed that aging can alter several cytokines expression during COVID - 19 ; in par - ticular , hospitalized COVID - 19 with > 70 years ( n = 23 ) were characterized by increased serum IL - 6 levels and decreased serum IFNγ levels , compared hospitalized COVID - 19 with < 60 years ( n = 26 ) . These features , as pre - viously reported , are correlated to poor prognosis [ 95 ] . Finally , lung tissue , in particular the alveolar cells type 2 , of COVID - 19 patients expressed increased senescence markers including p16 INK that positively correlated with expression of pro - inflammatory mediators such as IL - 1β and IL - 6 compared with lung tissue of patients with pneumonia not correlated with SARS - CoV - 2 infection ; these data were also confirmed with an in vitro analysis using alveolar cells type 2 infected with SARS - CoV - 2 [ 44 ] . Although the release of inflammatory mediators significantly contributes to respiratory dysfunction in COVID - 19 , the lungs are not the only organs affected . Indeed , the sustained systemic inflammatory responses can also cause multiple organ failure , particularly in high - risk individuals such as those affected by DM , obesity and systemic arterial hypertension [ 190 ] . Because the severity of COVID - 19 is associated with altered cytokine release , immunomodulatory therapies are used and / or proposed to control these responses [ 1 , 191 , 192 ] . Immunomodulation in COVID‑19 The severity of COVID - 19 may be largely due to a dysregulated inflammatory response . Progression of the host immune response , that follows the initial phase of viral replication , leads an increased release of pro - inflammatory cytokines which could exacerbate c - ARDS and multiorgan failure [ 193 – 195 ] . According to this evidence , several immunomodulator drugs are currently strongly recommended in the treatment of severe COVID - 19 [ 195 ] . However , the use of several antiviral drugs ( alone or in combination ) in hospitalized COVID - 19 patients such as remdesivir , hydroxychlo - roquine , lopinavir , IFNβ and polyclonal convalescent plasma , have not shown improvement in terms of mor - tality , need of mechanical ventilation and length of hos - pitalization when compared to standard care . However , there are new compounds / drugs in ongoing clinical tri - als that may have benefits in these patients [ 195 – 198 ] . Systemic glucorticoids Although glucocorticoids , such as dexamethasone , are not specific drugs , these can act as immunomodulators and growing evidence show that systemic glucocorticoids reduce mortality among patients with severe COVID - 19 . In some trials , these appeared to have synergistic effects with IL - 6R antagonists [ 195 ] and JAK blockers . The use of dexamethasone ( 6 mg once daily for 10 days ) in addition to standard care reduced mortality in hos - pitalized COVID - 19 patients ( n = 2104 ) , compared to hospitalized COVID - 19 patients treated only with stand - ard care ( n = 4321 ) . However , only COVID - 19 patients treated with dexamethasone who required mechanical ventilation and / or oxygen therapy showed a significant decreasing of mortality rate [ 199 ] . Another study investigated methylprednisolone in hospitalized COVID - 19 patients ( n = 62 ) and found a decreased risk of c - ARDS development and need of mechanical ventilation , compared to COVID - 19 patients that were not treated with methylprednisolone ( n = 139 ) [ 200 ] . Moreover , the use of dexamethasone ( 20 mg intra - venously daily for 5 days , followed by 10 mg intrave - nously daily for additional 5 days or until ICU discharge ) in addition to the standard care in hospitalized COVID - 19 patients ( n = 151 ) decreased the need for mechanical ventilation compared to hospitalized COVID - 19 patients treated with only the standard care ( n = 148 ) [ 201 ] . Furthermore , another study has shown the key role of the timing of starting systemic glucocorticoids therapy , use of early dexamethasone 6 mg / die i . v . in hospital - ized COVID - 19 patients within 24 h of ICU admission ( n = 372 ) was correlated to decreased risk of acute res - piratory failure development and the need for mechani - cal ventilation , compared to hospitalized COVID - 19 patients treated much later with dexamethasone 6 mg / die i . v . [ 202 ] . However , no further beneficial effect was found when using an increased dose of dexamethasone ( 12 mg / daily i . v . ) in severe COVID - 19 patients ( n = 503 ) as compared to the standard dose ( n = 497 ) ( 6 mg / daily i . v . ) [ 203 ] . Targeting IL‑1β , IL‑6 signalling pathways An increased and abnormal release of several pro - inflam - matory mediators , including IL - 1β and IL - 6 , has been found [ 195 ] in the dysregulated inflammatory responses of c - ARDS . Consequently , several drugs / compounds tar - geting IL - 1β or IL - 6 have been evaluated in several phase 3 clinical trials each ( NCT04372186 , NCT04409262 , NCT04678739 , NCT04364009 , NCT04443881 and NCT04324021 ) as therapeutic option of SARS - CoV - 2 infection to treat or prevent severe COVID - 19 evalu - ated . Currently , both inhibitors of both IL - β1 and IL - 6 pathways were approved for the treatment of hospitalized severe COVID - 19 patients [ 204 ] ( Fig . 4 ) . Several clinical trials have evaluated also the use of anakinra , an anti - IL - 1β drug . A study in severe COVID - 19 patients ( n = 59 ) using anakinra 200 mg twice for 3 days and after 100 mg twice for 1 day and 100 mg / die for 1 day , did not show any improvement in terms of survival , improvement of Page 16 of 24 Scaramuzzo et al . Journal of Inflammation ( 2023 ) 20 : 11 clinical symptoms and in decreasing need of mechanical ventilation compared standard care [ 205 ] . Conversely , a clinical study in hospitalized COVID - 19 patients ( n = 12 , i . v . 300 mg / die for 5 days and then then tapered with lower dosing over 3 days ) has shown a clinical improvement with a decreased need of oxygen therapy with or without mechanical ventilation , as com - pared to COVID - 19 patients treated with standard care ( n = 10 ) [ 206 ] . These finding were confirmed by Balkhair et al . , which used anakinra ( subcutaneous 100 mg twice daily for 3 days and then by 100 mg daily for 7 days ) in hospitalized COVID - 19 patients ( n = 45 ) and found a decreased need of invasive mechanical ventilation , as compared to hospitalized COVID - 19 patients ( n = 24 ) treated with standard care [ 207 ] . Moreover , anakinra ( subcutaneous 100mg once daily for 10 days ) in hospi - talized COVID - 19 patients ( n = 130 ) was also associated with a decreased risk of acute respiratory failure onset compared to hospitalized COVID - 19 patients treated with standard care ( n = 130 ) [ 208 ] . Finally , in hospitalized COVID - 19 patients ( n = 52 ) , the administration of anakinra ( subcutaneous 100 mg twice a day for 3 days , then 100 mg daily for 7 days ) decreased risk of need of mechanical ventilation and mortality compared to hos - pitalized COVID - 19 treated with standard care ( n = 44 ) [ 209 ] . The use of another inhibitor of IL - 1β in severe COVID - 19 patients , such as canakinumab , ( n = 227 ; intravenously injected 450 mg for body weight of < 60 kg , 600 mg for 60 – 80 kg , and 750 mg for > 80 kg ) did not reduce mortal - ity or the need of invasive mechanical ventilation com - pared to the placebo group ( n = 227 ) [ 210 ] . Immune dysregulation may be influenced by IL - 6 , as suggested by the correlation between its levels and SARS - CoV - 2 viremia and COVID - 19 severity [ 211 ] . Conse - quently , research has focused on inhibitors to interrupt this inflammatory cascade . Tocilizumab , a monoclonal antibody against IL - 6R used to treat multiple inflam - matory diseases , improved outcomes in patients with severe COVID - 19 [ 212 – 214 ] . The use of tocilizumab ( i . v . Fig . 4 Immunomodulation in COVID - 19 targeting IL - 1β and IL - 6 pro - inflammatory signalling pathways . Anakinra is a soluble IL - 1Ra that acting as a decoy receptor binds IL - 1β and prevents the activation of its receptor . Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody against IL - 6R , blocking IL - 6 binding to it and Canakinumab is a monoclonal antibody that bind IL - 1β preventing activation of its receptor . Baricitinib is a dual JAK1 and - 2 blocker . All these drugs inhibit the activation of several intracellular pro - inflammatory signalling pathways that induce the gene expression and the release of several pro - inflammatory mediators during SARS - CoV - 2 infection that develops into a “cytokines storm” .

Journal of Inflammation ( 2023 ) 20 : 11 8 mg / Kg not to exceed 800 mg ) in hospitalized COVID - 19 patients that did not receive mechanical ventilation ( n = 249 ) , decreased the risk of need of mechanical ven - tilation during hospital - stay as compared to COVID - 19 patients treated with placebo ( n = 128 ) [ 215 ] . Similarly , tocilizumab ( i . v . 8 mg / Kg ) in hospitalized COVID - 19 not requiring mechanical ventilation or ICU admission ( n = 63 ) , decreased the risk of need of mechanical ven - tilation as compared to hospitalized COVID - 19 patients treated with standard care ( n = 67 ) , however , tocilizumab treatment did not decrease mortality [ 216 ] . Conversely , a large study evaluating tocilizumab in COVID - 19 patients ( n = 2022 , 800 mg if weight > 90 kg ; 600 mg if weight > 65 and ≤ 90 kg ; 400 mg if weight > 40 and ≤ 65 kg ; and 8 mg / kg if weight ≤ 40 kg ) showed a decreased mortality , length of hospitalization and need of invasive mechanical ventilation compared to placebo group ( n = 2094 ) [ 217 ] . Also , in critical ICU COVID - 19 patients use of tocilizumab ( N = 353 , 8 mg / kg i . v . 1 or 2 / die ) decreased mortality compared to critical ICU COVID - 19 patients treated with standard care ( n = 402 ) [ 218 ] . In addition , a meta - analysis evaluating 27 trials has confirmed the effectiveness of tocilizumab , where use of this anti - IL - 6 antibody decreased 28 - day all - cause mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID - 19 [ 219 ] . Conversely , a clinical trial has shown that the use of toci - lizumab ( i . v . 8 mg / Kg not to exceed 800 mg ) in hospital - ized COVID - 19 patients ( n = 161 ) did not induce clinical improvement and decrease risk of intubation or mortal - ity , compared to hospitalized COVID - 19 patients treated with placebo ( n = 82 ) [ 220 ] . Similarly , in another cohort of hospitalized COVID - 19 patients , use of tocilizumab ( n = 294 , 8 mg / Kg daily i . v . ) did not improve clinical sta - tus and decrease hospital stay and mortality when com - pared to hospitalized COVID - 19 patients treated with standard care ( n = 144 ) [ 221 ] . Finally , another study has demonstrated that use of tocilizumab in COVID - 19 patients ( n = 79 ) was corre - lated with decreased need of mechanical ventilation and blood total leukocytes and neutrophils count and serum CRP levels even with several dosages such as < 400 mg / die , 400 – 800 mg / die and > 800 mg / die and with differ - ent timing of starting treatment such as 1 – 7 days post symptoms onset , 8 – 15 days , or more than 16 days , com - pared to COVID - 19 treated with standard care . However , significantly decreased mortality was detected only in COVID - 19 patients treated with 400 – 800 mg / die during the 8 – 15 days post symptoms onset [ 222 ] . Targeting other cytokine such as IL - 37 and IL - 38 rep - resents a novel potential therapeutic option whereby their inhibition can decrease IL - 1β release [ 93 ] . Targeting kinases Inhibitors of janus kinase ( JAK ) block the intracellu - lar signalling pathways of cytokines that promote and sustain inflammation in severe COVID - 19 , including IL - 2 , IL - 6 , IL - 10 , GM - CSF and IFNγ [ 195 ] . Baricitinib is currently used in COVID - 19 treatment , this is a selec - tive JAK inhibitor ( JAK1 and JAK2 ) that has shown to indirectly decrease IL - 6 production [ 195 , 223 ] ( Fig . 4 ) . Use of baricitinib ( 4 mg twice / die for 2 days and after 4 mg / die for 7 days ) in hospitalized COVID - 19 patients ( n = 20 ) , decreased serum levels of both IL - 1β and IL - 6 and moreover , increased the P / F ratio decreasing need of oxygen therapy as compared to hospitalized COVID - 19 ( n = 56 ) treated with standard care [ 224 ] . Similarly , baricitinib treatment ( 4 mg twice / die for 2 days and after 4 mg / die for 7 days ) in addition to systemic glucocorti - coids in hospitalized COVID - 19 with acute respiratory failure ( n = 62 ) , was correlated with increased PaO2 / FiO2 ratio at discharge time compared to hospitalized COVID - 19 with acute respiratory failure ( n = 50 ) treated only with systemic glucocorticoids [ 225 ] . A randomized trial evaluated the combination of baricitinib plus rem - desivir ( anti - viral ) in > 1 , 000 hospitalized patients with COVID - 19 , finding that the combination of both drugs was superior to remdesivir alone in reducing recovery time and improving clinical status , particularly among non - intubated patients [ 226 ] . Moreover , a phase 3 clini - cal trial has shown that use of baricitinib ( 4 mg / day for 14 days ) in hospitalized COVID - 19 patients ( n = 764 ) in addition to standard care decreased 28 - day and 60 - day mortality compared to hospitalized COVID - 19 patients treated only with standard care [ 227 ] . Several ongoing , or just completed , clinical trials are further evaluating the efficacy of baricitinib ( NCT04970719 , NCT04693026 , NCT05074420 , NCT05082714 ) . Tofacitinib ( 10 mg twice for 14 days ) has also shown some effect in hospitalized COVID - 19 patients . It showed , in addition to standard care , a decrease in mor - tality and onset of respiratory failure ( n = 114 ) when compared to hospitalized COVID - 19 patients ( n = 145 ) treated only with standard care [ 228 ] . Prevention of thrombosis in COVID‑19 patients As previously described , COVID - 19 is characterized by a pro - thrombotic status induced by both a SARS - CoV - 2 induced endothelial cell damage and an inhibition of fibrinolysis [ 152 ] correlating to increased risk of coagu - lopathy and venous thromboembolism development . For these reasons , use of anticoagulant drugs and in par - ticular low - molecular - weight heparin , was evaluated to improve outcomes of COVID - 19 patients [ 229 ] . Page 18 of 24 Scaramuzzo et al . Journal of Inflammation ( 2023 ) 20 : 11 Although low - molecular - weight heparin is an antico - agulant drug , it is also known that can indirectly induce anti - inflammatory effects through binding and modu - lating pro - inflammatory mediators including ; CXCL8 , platelet growth factor 4 ( PGF4 ) and the pro - inflamma - tory transcription factor nuclear factor kappa - B ( NF - κB ) both in endothelial and bronchiolar cells . This could explain how use of this therapy in COVID - 19 patients improves their outcomes [ 229 ] . Currently , use of low - molecular - weight heparin at a thromboprophylaxis dosage is recommended in all hos - pitalized patients with pneumonia induced by SARS - CoV - 2 infection . However , a clinical trial has shown that the use of low - molecular - weight heparin at therapeutic dosages in criti - cally ill COVID - 19 patients ( n = 536 ) did not improve survival , nor did it decrease the risk for ventilation sup - port when compared to low - molecular - weight heparin at a thromboprophylaxis dosage ( n = 567 ) [ 230 ] . Conversely , in non - critically ill COVID - 19 patients ( n = 1181 ) use of low - molecular - weight heparin at thera - peutic dosages was correlated to decreased mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation , compared to non - critically ill COVID - 19 patients ( n = 1050 ) treated with low - molecular - weight heparin at a thromboprophylaxis dose [ 231 ] . Finally , use of enoxaparin in hospitalized COVID - 19 patients ( n = 96 ) , was correlated to decreased mortality compared to hospitalized COVID - 19 patients ( n = 96 ) treated with unfractionated heparin [ 232 ] . A further clinical trial has shown that use of low - molecular - weight heparin at thromboprophylaxis dos - ages did not induce any benefits in non - hospitalized SARS - CoV - 2 infected patients ( n = 105 ) , compared to standard treatments ( n = 114 ) [ 233 ] . Similarly , use of low - molecular - weight heparin at thromboprophylaxis dosages in non - hospitalized patients did not decrease need of hospitalization in SARS - CoV - 2 infected patients ( n = 234 ) compared to SARS - CoV - 2 infected patients ( n = 238 ) treated with standard care [ 234 ] . Conclusion Although the COVID - 19 pandemic still represents a major challenge for the healthcare systems worldwide , the cellular and molecular pathogenic pathways cor - related to severe SARS - CoV - 2 infection are still incom - pletely understood . There is growing evidence that c - ARDS is characterized by different cellular and molec - ular inflammatory pathways , compared to “classical” ARDS . This knowledge has therapeutic relevance for understanding the molecular basis of current drug treat - ments for c - ARDS and the search for novel compounds . For this reason , further investigations are needed to fully clarify the pathogenesis of this disease and to increase the clinical efficacy of our treatments .
