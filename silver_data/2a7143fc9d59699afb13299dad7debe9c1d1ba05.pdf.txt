Dissection of Arabidopsis ADP - RIBOSYLATION FACTOR 1 Function in Epidermal Cell Polarity W Jian Xu and Ben Scheres 1 Department of Molecular Cell Biology , Utrecht University , 3584 CH Utrecht , The Netherlands Vesicle trafﬁcking is essential for the generation of asymmetries , which are central to multicellular development . Core components of the vesicle transport machinery , such as ADP - ribosylation factor ( ARF ) GTPases , have been studied primarily at the single - cell level . Here , we analyze developmental functions of the ARF1 subclass of the Arabidopsis thaliana multigene ARF family . Six virtually identical ARF1 genes are ubiquitously expressed , and single loss - of - function mutants in these genes reveal no obvious developmental phenotypes . Fluorescence colocalization studies reveal that ARF1 is localized to the Golgi apparatus and endocytic organelles in both onion ( Allium cepa ) and Arabidopsis cells . Apical - basal polarity of epidermal cells , reﬂected by the position of root hair outgrowth , is affected when ARF1 mutants are expressed at early stages of cell differentiation but after they exit mitosis . Genetic interactions during root hair tip growth and localization suggest that the ROP2 protein is a target of ARF1 action , but its localization is slowly affected upon ARF1 manipulation when compared with that of Golgi and endocytic markers . Localization of a second potential target of ARF1 action , PIN2 , is also affected with slow kinetics . Although extreme redundancy precludes conventional genetic dissection of ARF1 functions , our approach separates different ARF1 downstream networks involved in local and speciﬁc aspects of cell polarity . INTRODUCTION The generation of polarity within cells is crucial for cell intrinsic functions , such as localized protein secretion and cell division . In addition , cell polarity plays multiple roles in the multicellular context , for example , in the partitioning of fate determinants during asymmetric cell division . Asymmetries for both cell - intrinsic and developmental purposes in yeast and animal sys - tems depend on vesicle trafﬁcking ( Mostov et al . , 2003 ) . Genetic screens have revealed speciﬁc regulators of vesicle trafﬁcking in animal and plants ( see below ) , but core factors , such as ADP - ribosylation factors ( ARFs ) , have mainly been studied in cultured cells . ARF family members cycle between an active GTP - bound and an inactive GDP - bound state . A subset of ARF proteins is referred to as class 1 based on their sequence conservation , and these proteins regulate intracellular vesicular trafﬁcking at multiple stages of the secretory and lysosomal / vacuolar trans - port pathways in mammalian and plant cells ( Balch et al . , 1992 ; Lee et al . , 2002 ; Presley et al . , 2002 ; Takeuchi et al . , 2002 ; Pimpl et al . , 2003 ) . In particular , class 1 ARF proteins participate in the formation of transport vesicles and the selection of transmem - brane protein cargo from donor compartments in mammalian cells ( Goldberg , 2000 ; Spang , 2002 ) . The vesicle transport inhibitor brefeldin A ( BFA ) has been shown to interfere with ARF action in mammalian , fungal , and plant cells ( Chardin and McCormick , 1999 ; Nebenfuhr et al . , 2002 ) . BFA inhibits the rate of guanine nucleotide exchange exhibitedbyARF1andinterfereswithARF1functioninCOPIcoat recruitment . Crystal structure of the ARF1 - GDP / Sec7 / BFA com - plex shows that BFA binds at the protein – protein interface to inhibit conformational changes in ARF1 required for Sec7 to dislodge the GDP molecule ( Mossessova et al . , 2003 ) . BFA induces redistribution of Golgi proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) in mammalian and plant cells ( Lippincott - Schwartz et al . , 1989 ; Saint - Jore et al . , 2002 ) . Moreover , in - terference of BFA with the endocytic pathways in animals and plants has been reported ( Lippincott - Schwartz et al . , 1991 ; Geldner et al . , 2003 ; Grebe et al . , 2003 ) . BFA also interferes with cell polarity in plants , in which it disturbs zygote polarity in Fucus ( Shaw and Quatrano , 1996 ) , randomizes the root hair initiation site of Arabidopsis thaliana trichoblast cells , and inter - feres with the localization of putative auxin efﬂux carrier compo - nents of the PIN family and auxin inﬂux carrier AUX1 ( Geldner et al . , 2001 ; Grebe et al . , 2002 ) . Consistent with a potential role for the ARF proteins in the establishment of plant cell polarity , mutations in BFA - sensitive Arabidopsis GNOM / EMB30 ARF - GEF ( guanine nucleotide ex - change factor ) lead to aberrant cell shape and orientation of cell division ( Mayer et al . , 1993 ; Shevell et al . , 1994 ) .

The Plant Cell Preview , www . aspb . org ª 2005 American Society of Plant Biologists 1 of 12 Additional targets for ARF - dependent vesicle trafﬁcking are suggested by the observation that BFA inhibits early polar localization of ROP ( RHO of plants ) proteins at the root hair initiation site ( Molendijk et al . , 2001 ) . ROP proteins are homologs of the RHO / RAC / CDC42 , members of the RHO family GTPases , which include key regulators of cell polarity in yeast and animals ( Etienne - Manneville and Hall , 2002 ) . ARF family GTPases are required for several CDC42 - mediated functions because human CDC42 is BFA sensitive and expression of a dominant - negative form of human ARF1 results in the redistribution of Golgi - localized human CDC42 to the cytosol ( Erickson et al . , 1996 ) . In comparison with yeasts and animals , Arabidopsis has many class 1 ARF proteins ( Ju¨rgens and Geldner , 2002 ; Vernoud et al . , 2003 ) . Transient expression of constitutively active ( GTP - locked form ) or constitutively inactive ( GDP - locked form ) mutants of ARF1 in tobacco ( Nicotiana tabacum ) and Arabidopsis cultured cells shows that this protein is required for the sequence - speciﬁc vacuolar sorting route to the lytic vacuole ( Pimpl et al . , 2003 ) and inﬂuences ER - to - Golgi transport as well as Golgi - derived trans - port to the plasma membrane , dependent on the cargo molecule ( Lee et al . , 2002 ; Takeuchi et al . , 2002 ) . Moreover , Arabidopsis ARF1 is able to complement and rescue the ARF1 - ARF2 lethal yeast double mutant ( Takeuchi et al . , 2002 ) . These results suggest that class 1 ARF proteins in Arabidopsis have similar cellular functions to their yeast and animal counterparts . Here , we investigate developmental functions of Arabidopsis ARF1 . As our expression and loss - of - function analysis suggests extensive redundancy , we expressed GTP - and GDP - locked mutants of ARF1 using region - speciﬁc and heat shock – inducible promoters and analyzed the consequences in the context of the multicellular organism . We demonstrate that class 1 ARF func - tion is essential in plant development and that regulated expres - sion of GTP - and GDP - locked mutants of ARF1 can be used to demonstrate roles of ARF1 in apical - basal polarity of epidermal cells and for ROP and PIN protein localization . RESULTS Arabidopsis Class 1 ARF Proteins Have Redundant Functions and Overlapping Expression Patterns In Arabidopsis , six class 1 ARF proteins have been identiﬁed by the genome sequencing project . They share 98 to 100 % amino acid identitywith oneanother andconserved splice sitepositions ( data not shown ) . Four of them can be grouped into two pairs derivedfrom segmentalgenomeduplication events ( Ju¨rgensand Geldner , 2002 ) . T - DNA insertion lines from the SIGNAL and the Syngenta GARLIC collections ( McElver et al . , 2001 ; Alonso et al . , 2003 ; data not shown ) revealed no obvious phenotypes , indicating extensive functional redundancy . Multiple RNA interference lines targeted to a common class 1 ARF sequence also revealed no speciﬁc phenotypes ( data not shown ) . If class 1 ARF proteins perform overlapping functions in Arabidopsis development , they should also share expression domains . We therefore created promoter fusions for all six class 1 ARF proteins using the ER - localized yellow ﬂuorescent protein ( ERYFP ) as a reporter . For each promoter fusion , 20 independent transgenic lines were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy ( CLSM ) . ERYFP expression was observed in all the promoter fusion lines except for ARF6 ( At5g14670 ) , which is preferentially expressed in anthers and pollen ( see Supplemen - tal Figure 1A online ) . The promoter fusion lines for the other ﬁve class 1 ARF proteins showed essentially the same expression pattern with constitutive ERYFP expression in young seedlings ( see Supplemental Figures 1B to 1F online ) , indicating extensive overlap of class 1 ARF gene expression . We focused our studies on the Arabidopsis ARF1 ( At2g47170 ) because this member has been studied at the cellular level ( Lee et al . , 2002 ; Takeuchi et al . , 2002 ; Pimpl et al . , 2003 ) . GenBank EST expression data ( http : / / www . ncbi . nih . gov / Genbank / ) con - ﬁrmthat ARF1 isexpressedinallorgansexamined . Toinvestigate tissue speciﬁcity of ARF1 mRNA expression in different organs and at different developmental stages , we created ARF1 pro - moter fusions using b - glucuronidase ( GUS ) as a reporter . GUS activity was detected throughout the roots of all the transgenic lines examined ( see Supplemental Figure 1G online ) . In addition , we also observed strong GUS activity in vascular bundles , leaf primordia , stomata , trichomes , style , stigmatic tissue , and young pollen ( see Supplemental Figures 1H to 1J online ) . Intense GUS activity was detected in embryo sacs and dissected embryos of all stages ( see Supplemental Figure 1K online ) . We investigated whether posttranscriptional regulation af - fected ARF1 expression by making stable transgenic Arabi - dopsis plants carrying the fusion construct of wild - type ARF1 ( ARF1 - WT ) and enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein ( EGFP ) under control of the Arabidopsis ARF1 promoter ( arf1 - ARF1 - WT - EGFP ) . Constitutive GFP expression was found in all the ARF1 - WT - EGFP translational fusion lines . For example , GFP ﬂuorescence was observed in all cells within the root meristem , and GFP ﬂuorescence localized to the region of forming cell plate , to thegrowing root hairs , and also wasdetected in stomata and trichome cells ( see Supplemental Figures 1L to 1P online ) . Collectively , our data suggest that the ARF1 protein is ubiqui - tously expressed and overlaps with the expression domain of the class 1 ARF members . Arabidopsis ARF1 Localizes to Golgi Apparatus and Endocytic Organelles In both yeast and mammalian cells , ARF1 - Q71L ( GTP - locked form ) has signiﬁcantly reduced GTPase activity and therefore behaves as a constitutively activated mutant ( Pepperkok et al . , 2000 ) that cannot hydrolyze its GTP and interferes with the sorting of membrane proteins into Golgi - derived COPI vesicles . ARF - T31N ( GDP - locked form ) has low afﬁnity for GTP and has been shown to behave as a dominant - negative mutant ( Dascher and Balch , 1994 ) that blocks the formation of COPI - coated vesicles . Asthecritical amino acidsare conservedamongclass1 ARF proteins ( data not shown ) , both mutants are expected to also impair ARF1 - mediated vesicle transport in plants . We made protein fusion constructs of ARF1 - WT and the GTP - and GDP - locked dominant mutants of ARF1 , namely ARF1 - Q71L and ARF - T31N with EGFP , enhanced cyan ﬂuorescent protein ( ECFP ) , or enhanced yellow ﬂuorescent protein ( EYFP ) , under control of a 35S promoter of Cauliﬂower mosaic virus ( CaMV ) . We 2 of 12 The Plant Cell studied the intracellular localization and dynamics of the trans - location of ARF1 protein during transient expression in onion ( Allium cepa ) epidermal cells . GTP - locked ARF1 colocalized with wild - type ARF1 in multiple punctuate structures , whereas no ﬂuorescent motile organelles were observed in cells with GDP - locked ARF1 construct ( Figures 1A to 1D ; see Supplemental Movie 1 online ) . Colocalization studies using ARF1 - WT - EC / YFP and a resident Golgi protein N - a - 2 , 6 - sialyltransferase ( N - ST ) fused to YFP ( N - ST - YFP ; Grebe et al . , 2003 ) or a Golgi - targeted N - acetylglu - cosaminyl ( NAG ) transferase fused to ECFP ( NAG - ECFP ) sug - gest that ARF1 largely resides in or associates with the Golgi apparatus but also localizes to organelles negative for the Golgi markers ( Figure 1E ; see Supplemental Figure 2A and Movies 2 to 4 online ) . The Golgi localization of ARF1 is in agreement with observations on maize ( Zea mays ) and tobacco cells using ARF1 antisera ( Pimpl et al . , 2000 ; Ritzenthaler et al . , 2002 ) . However , our data indicate that ARF1 localizes to additional sites . Indeed , we found that ARF1 - WT - EGFP ﬂuorescence partially overlaps with the endocytic marker FM4 - 64 ( Figure 1F ; see Supplemental Movie 5 online ) , which does not label Golgi apparatus in both onion and Arabidopsis cells ( see Supplemental Figures 2B , 2D , and Movie 6 online ) , suggesting that Arabidopsis ARF1 is also localized to endocytic organelles . Furthermore , a subpopulation of ARF1 ﬂuorescence coincides with a red ﬂuorescent protein ( RFP ) fusion to the conventional type RAB5 homolog ARA7 from Arabidopsis ( RFP - ARA7 ; Figure 1G ; see Supplemental Movie 7 online ) but not with a plant unique RAB GTPase ARA6 fused to EYFP ( ARA6 - EYFP ; Ueda et al . , 2001 ; see Supplemental Figure 2C and Movie 8 online ) , indicating that ARF1 and ARA7 reside in different endocytic organelles from ARA6 . In addition , we found that ARF1 - EYFP ﬂuorescence moves along actin ﬁlaments , illustrated by an EGFP fusion to the mouse F - actin – binding protein TALIN ( EGFP - TALIN ; Kost et al . , 1998 ; Figure 1H ; see Supplemental Movie 9 online ) . We next studied the intracellular localization of wild - type ARF1 and its mutated forms in transgenic Arabidopsis plants . A heat shock – inducible promoter from the Arabidopsis HSP18 . 2 gene ( Takahashietal . , 1993 ) wasusedtodrive expression ofthefusion proteins . Intense GFP expression was induced in Arabidopsis root cells within 2 h after heat shock induction ( 37 8 C , 2 h ) . Both heat shock – induced ARF1 - WT - YFP and ARF1 - Q71L - YFP dis - tribute similar to arf1 - ARF1 - WT - EGFP ( Figures 2A , 2B , and 2D1 ) , suggesting that the heat shock promoter activity levels used did not alter protein localization . In hsp18 . 2 - ARF1 - T31N - ECFP lines , CFP ﬂuorescence is largely cytosolic and localizes to the nucleus , whereas no moving organelles were labeled ( Figure 2C ) .

Taken together , our data suggest that ARF1 resides both in Golgi stacks and in a subpopulation of vesicles that move along actin ﬁlaments . ARF1 Function in Arabidopsis Trichoblast Cells The Arabidopsis root allows dissection of different aspects of cell polarity in plants . Distally , meristematic root cells divide in oriented planes . In the more proximal cell elongation and cell differentiation zones , trichoblast cells will develop root hairs at Figure 2 .

Furthermore , root hairs elongate by polar tip growth . BFA treatment interferes with both aspects of epidermal polarity in a concentration - dependent manner ( Grebe et al . , 2002 ; Figures 4F and 4I ) , indicating that ARF - dependent processes are involved in apical - basal polarity and polar tip growth . In a search for speciﬁc ARF1 effects , we focused on polarity aspects of a single cell type : the trichoblast . To dissect ARF1 functions , the GAL4 - VP16 ( GV ) / UAS binary expression system ( Brand and Perrimon , 1993 ) was used for region - speciﬁc expression of wild - type ARF1 and its mutated forms . Manipulation of ARF1 function in the root meristem using the root meristem – speciﬁc rch1GV driver affected root develop - ment , directional cell expansion , and cytokinesis ( see Supple - mental Figure 3 online ) , consistent with the expected household role of ARF1 in vesicle trafﬁcking . However , it did not cause any obvious defects in root hair initiation and root hair tip growth ( see Supplemental Figures 3C , 3F , 3H , and 3J online ) . We therefore speciﬁcally interfered with ARF1 function in trichoblasts . ARF1 - WT and ARF1 mutants were expressed using a trichoblast - speciﬁc driver prp3GV whose expression is initiated at the onset of root hair outgrowth ( Bernhardt and Tierney , 2000 ; Figure 3A ) . No alteration in apical - basal epidermal polarity or tip growth occurred in ARF1 - WT – overexpressing lines ( Figures 3B , 3G , 3L , and 3M ) , but trichoblast - speciﬁc expression of ARF1 - Q71L or ARF1 - T31N signiﬁcantly inhibited tip growth ( Figures 3C to 3F , 3H to 3K , 3N , and 3O ) . Root hair formation can be completely abolished after strong heat shock induction ( 37 8 C , 4 h ) in transgenic lines carrying hsp18 . 2GV and UAS - ARF1 - Q71L or UAS - ARF1 - T31N , whereas root hairs are normal in wild - type plants or ARF1 - WT – over - expressing lines under the same conditions ( n ¼ 100 ; Figures 4A to 4C ) . Unlike in ARF1 - T31N – expressing lines ( Figures 4C and 4E ) , proper root hair formation recovers abruptly in ARF1 - Q71L – expressing lines within 2 d , demonstrating that the effects of GTP - locked ARF1 on root hair formation are reversible ( Figures Figure 3 . ARF1 Function Is Required for Root Hair Tip Growth in Arabidopsis Trichoblast Cells . ( A ) Expression of the GFP reporter gene under the control of the trichoblast - speciﬁc PRP3 promoter .

Root hairs are able to develop in ARF1 - Q71L – and ARF1 - T31N – expressing lines after mild heat shock induction ( 37 8 C , 2 h ) , but polarized root hair tip growth is signiﬁcantly inhibited ( Figures 4G , 4H , and 4J ) . These data suggest a dose - dependent effect of ARF1 manipulation on tip growth in Arabi - dopsis root hairs . Consistent with the effect of BFA treatment ( Grebe et al . , 2002 ) , apical - basal polarity in root hair initiation is dramatically affected by heat shock – induced expression of ARF1 - T31N but not ARF1 - Q71L ( Figures 4G , 4H , and 4J ) . The difference in effect of the GTP - and GDP - locked mutants of ARF1 on epidermal polarity might indicate that they act on different targets , but can also reﬂect differences in protein level or stability . Apical - basal trichoblast polarity was not affected by the ARF1 mutants expressed in PRP3 or RCH1 expression domain as well as in the root cap region ( data not shown ) . We concluded that root hair positioning in response to epidermal polarity and the decision to grow out a hair per se occur in the elongation zone . ARF1 Function Is Required for ROP2 Localization and Action The Arabidopsis ROP2 / ARAC4 gene has been implicated as a regulator of both apical - basal polarity in root hair initiation and polarized root hair tip growth . The ROP2 gene is expressed throughout root hair development , and ROP2 overexpression results in longer root hairs with multiple tips , whereas constitu - tively active GTP - bound ROP2 ( ROP2 - G14V ) expression inhibits and depolarizes root hair tip growth ( Jones et al . , 2002 ) . Trans - genic lines carrying prp3GV and UAS - ROP2 - G14V display the bulged root hair phenotype reported for 35S - ROP2 lines ( Figure Figure 4 .

BFA inhibits early polar localization of ROP proteins at the root hair initiation site , suggesting that root hair initiation requires an early - acting ARF - dependent process ( Molendijk et al . , 2001 ) . To determine whether ARF1 function is involved in ROP2 action , we studied genetic interactions between ARF1 and ROP2 in tricho - blast cells . We crossed UAS - ARF1 - Q71L or UAS - ARF1 - T31N into the transgenic lines carrying prp3GV and UAS - ROP2 - G14V , and performed epistasis analysis in the F1 progeny . In all the F1 lines examined , root hairs showed tip growth defects but displayed no bulging ( Figures 5D to 5I ) , indicating that ROP2 function in controlling polarized tip growth is ARF1 dependent . We next investigated the localization of the ROP2 protein in Arabidopsis plants carrying the fusion construct of EYFP and ROP2 ( EYFP - ROP2 ) under the control of the ROP2 promoter . YFP ﬂuorescence is highly enriched in the apical and basal plasma membranes of the root meristematic cells ( Figure 5J ) , and consistent with its role in cell polarity , EYFP - ROP2 localized to the future site of root hair formation as well as to the tips of growing root hairs ( Figure 5K ) . Moreover , EYFP - ROP2 partially colocalized with endocytic marker FM4 - 64 upon BFA treatment ( Figures 5L to 5N ) , implying ARF - dependent ROP2 trafﬁcking . Heat shock ( 37 8 C , 2 h ) – induced overexpression of wild - type ARF1 had no obvious effects on the localization of the EYFP - ROP2 fusion protein ( Figure 5O ) . However , in ARF1 - Q71L – or ARF1 - T31N – expressing lines , localization of the EYFP - ROP2 fusion protein was signiﬁcantly altered within 20 h after heat shock induction , illustrated by strong internalization and reduced YFP ﬂuorescence on the plasma membrane ( Figures 5P and 5Q ) . These results suggest that ARF1 function is required for ROP2 localization . ARF1 - Q71LandARF1 - T31NActRapidlyonGolgiTrafﬁcking and FM4 - 64 Uptake but Slowly on PIN2 Localization Delocalization of ROP2 after ARF1 manipulation was not clearly observed until 20 h after heat shock , which posed the question whether dominant ARF1 mutants act slowly on all ARF1 - dependent processes or whether ROP2 localization defects might require intermediate steps . To assess whether heat shock – induced ARF1 mutants can rapidly affect known vesicular trafﬁcking pathways in the intact plant , we analyzed changes in the distribution of Golgi markers , a functional auxin efﬂux com - ponent PIN2 - EGFP fusion , and the endocytic marker FM4 - 64 . As a control , we timed the delocalization response of these markers to ARF - GEF inhibition by BFA treatment . Figure 5 . ARF1 Function Is Required for ROP2 Localization and Action .

ADP - RIBOSYLATION FACTOR 1 and Cell Polarity in Arabidopsis 7 of 12 No changes were observed in the distribution of any marker after the overexpression of ARF - WT at all heat shock periods used ( Figures 6A , 6E , 6I , 6M , 6Q , and 6U ) . However , within 3 h of heat shock at 37 8 C , ﬂuorescence of the two Golgi markers N - ST - YFP and NAG - EGFP was signiﬁcantly altered in both ARF1 - Q71L – and ARF1 - T31N – expressing lines ( Figures 6B , 6C , 6F , and 6G ) . Surprisingly , PIN2 - EGFP was visibly internalized only after prolonged heat shock ( Figures 6J , 6K , 6N , and 6O ) , suggesting that PIN2 exocytosis responds slowly to ARF1 manipulation . We found almost no internalization of FM4 - 64 after 3 h of induction of ARF1 - Q71L and ARF1 - T31N expression ( Figures 6R and 6S ) , and almost no vacuoles were labeled by FM4 - 64 within 3 h of heat shock at 37 8 C when FM4 - 64 was added before heat shock induction ( Figures 6V and 6W ) . Thus , uptake of FM4 - 64 at the plasma membrane and endocytic trafﬁcking of FM4 - 64 from endocytic organelles to the vacuole are affected , consistent with the inhibition of endocytosis by GTP - locked human ARF1 ( Zhang et al . , 1994 ) . BFA treatment affects the localization of Golgi markers within 15 min to 1 h ( Figures 6D and 6H ) , consistent with the rapid changes observed upon ARF1 modulation . However , PIN2 - EGFP , a slow responder to ARF1 modulation , responds rapidly to BFA ( Figures 6L and 6P ) . More strikingly , the response to BFA of the endocytic marker FM4 - 64 differs from its response to ARF1 manipulation because BFA strongly interferes with endo - cytic trafﬁcking of FM4 - 64 from endocytic organelles to the vacuole but not with FM4 - 64 uptake ( Figure 6T and 6X ) . This might suggest that ARF1 modulates uptake through interaction with a BFA - insensitive ARF - GEF . DISCUSSION In Arabidopsis , multiple almost identical ARF1 family members exist , but their highly similar expression domain and the lack of mutant phenotypes in individual knockouts suggest that all family members have extensively shared functions . Expansion of gene families hampers straightforward dissection of context - speciﬁc roles during multicellular development . Moreover , com - plete knockouts of central players of the secretory system often lead to male gametophytic or embryonic lethality , which makes it very difﬁcult to analyze their precise cell - biological roles ( Zizioli et al . , 1999 ; Sanderfoot et al . , 2001 ) . Yet , studies on ARF interactors and their inhibitors suggest that the ARF system serves such context - speciﬁc roles , as illustrated by recent investigations on the GNOM / EMB30 ARF - GEF and its link to polar auxin transport inplanta ( Geldner et al . , 2003 ) . Here , we use ARF1 - WT and GTP - and GDP - locked dominant mutants of ARF1 ( ARF1 - Q71L and ARF1 - T31N ) to dissect roles of ARF1 in Arabidopsis . We show that manipulation of Arabidopsis ARF1 function in separate domains inﬂuences expected processes such as cytokinesis and tip growth . However , we also reveal speciﬁc modulation of apical - basal epidermal polarity in a dis - tinct phase of development . At the molecular level , we show that the kinetics of inducible ARF responses can be used to separate direct and indirect effects on protein localization . ARF1 has been shown to localize to Golgi apparatus in both mammalian and plant cells ( Vasudevan et al . , 1998 ; Pimpl et al . , 2000 ; Ritzenthaler et al . , 2002 ) . Unexpectedly , we detected Arabidopsis ARF1 in endocytic organelles , suggesting that it plays a role in the trafﬁcking of endocytic vesicles like non - plant ARF1 ( Gaynor et al . , 1998 ; Gu and Gruenberg , 2000 ) . Consistent with this notion , uptake and trafﬁcking of the endocytic marker FM4 - 64isinhibited bybothGTP - and GDP - lockedforms ofARF1 . Moreover , a subpopulation of Arabidopsis ARF1 coincides with the RAB5 homolog ARA7 but not with ARA6 ( Ueda et al . , 2001 ) . The effects of the ARF - GEF inhibitor BFA suggest that ARF - dependent vesicle trafﬁcking plays an important role in the establishment of apical - basal epidermal polarity and in root hair tip growth ( Grebe et al . , 2002 ) . Here , we show that dominant mutants of ARF1 interfere with both aspects of cell polarity , raising the question whether ARF1 is a target for both BFA - sensitive ARF - GEF – dependent polarity changes . Which effectors are important for these polarization events ? We show that polar ROP2 localization to the hair tip and phe - notypic activity of ROP2 in this region require ARF1 function . These data functionally support the idea that root hair initiation involves ARF1 - dependent polar localization of the ROP proteins ( Molendijk et al . , 2001 ) . The slow relocalization of ROP2 after ARF1manipulationsuggeststhatintermediatestepsareinvolved and that ARF1 may not be the principal ARF regulated by BFA - sensitive ARF - GEFs in ROP2 trafﬁcking . However , we cannot exclude the formal possibility that these slow kinetics reﬂect interference of ARF1 manipulation with unrelated pathways . The auxin transport machinery and actin cytoskeleton have been implicated in the establishment of apical - basal trichoblast polarity ( Masucci and Schiefelbein , 1994 ; Sabatini et al . , 1999 ; Grebe et al . , 2002 ; Ringli et al . , 2002 ) . Furthermore , auxin inﬂux and efﬂux carriers are BFA sensitive , and actin - mediated vesicle trafﬁcking is required for the recycling of auxin efﬂux carriers ( Morris and Robinson , 1998 ; Geldner et al . , 2001 , 2003 ; Grebe et al . , 2002 , 2003 ) . We show that ARF1 manipulation can affect apical - basal polarity and interferes with PIN2 - EGFP recycling , indicating that auxin transport carriers require proper ARF function . However , dominant ARF1 mutant – mediated PIN2 - EGFP internalization is slow compared with changes in Golgi and endocytic markers , whereas PIN2 - EGFP is among the fastest responders to BFA . These observations raise the possi - bility that ARF1 also inﬂuences vesicular cycling of auxin efﬂux carriers in an indirect way , whereas GNOM and / or other BFA - sensitive ARF - GEFs interact with another ARF member that is more directly involved in PIN recycling . Our ﬁndings suggest that ARF1 may not be the most BFA - sensitive target in polarization events involving ROP and PIN proteins , and they illustrate that caution needs to be exerted in inferring direct interactions from developmental phenotypes upon ARF manipulation . Further dissection of speciﬁc ARF1 - mediated processes will be required to reach a better understanding of its role in multiple distinct polarization events . A spectrum of interacting proteins , such as ARF - GEFs and ARF - GAPs , can provide speciﬁcity to ARF1 action . Furthermore , connected trafﬁcking pathways may be secondarily affected , and these will have to be identiﬁed in each case . Our tissue - speciﬁc approach for ARF1 misregulation deﬁnes a ready - to - go system to search for speciﬁc vesicle transport components impinging on cell and tissue polarity by straightforward suppressor and enhancer screens . 8 of 12 The Plant Cell Figure 6 .

ADP - RIBOSYLATION FACTOR 1 and Cell Polarity in Arabidopsis 9 of 12 METHODS Plant Growth Conditions Arabidopsis thaliana seeds were sterilized with the vapor - phase steriliza - tion protocol described at http : / / plantpath . wisc . edu / ; afb / vapster . html and imbibed for 4 d at 4 8 C in the dark , then germinated on vertically oriented plates containing half - strength MS agar ( Duchefa , Haarlem , The Netherlands ) and 1 % sucrose , pH 5 . 8 , and grown in a plant room at 22 8 C with a 16 - h - light / 8 - h - dark cycle . Plasmid Construction and Plant Transformation ARF1 and ROP2 cDNA were ampliﬁed from an Arabidopsis cDNA library using PCR , and cDNA sequences were veriﬁed . Q71L and T31N muta - tions in ARF1 and the G14V mutation in ROP2 were introduced using a PCR - based site - mutagenesis strategy ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) . For the arf1 - ERYFP and arf1 - GUS promoter fusion constructs , 2 . 64 kb of upstream sequence from the Arabidopsis ARF1 gene was fused to an ERYFP or GUS reporter gene and nopaline synthase terminator engi - neered in pGREENII - 0229 . To make the arf1 - ARF1 - WT - EGFP , 35S - ARF1 - WT - EGFP ( or ECFP or EYFP ) , 35S - ARF1 - Q71L - EGFP , 35S - ARF1 - T31N - EGFP , hsp18 . 2 - ARF1 - WT - EGFP , hsp18 . 2 - ARF1 - Q71L - EYFP , and hsp18 . 2 - ARF1 - T31N - ECFP constructs , EGFP ( orECFPorEYFP ) was fusedinframe to theCterminus of ARF1 wild - type or mutant proteins . The resulting fusions were cloned into the pGREENII - 0229 vector ( http : / / www . pgreen . ac . uk ) under the control of the Arabidopsis ARF1 promoter , CaMV 35S promoter , or Arabidopsis HSP18 . 2 promoter ( 847 bp ) , respectively . NAG - EYFP and NAG - ECFP were generated from NAG - EGFP ( Grebe et al . , 2003 ) by exchanging of EGFP to EYFP or ECFP . For ARA6 - EYFP , NAG cDNA was exchanged for ARA6 cDNA . To create EGFP - TALIN , the mouse TALIN F - actin – binding sequence from pSYC14 ( a generous gift fromN . H . Chua , RockefellerUniversity , NewYork , NY ) wasfusedinframe to the C terminus of EGFP engineered in pGREENII - 0229 between the CaMV 35S promoter and nopaline synthase terminator . To create the rch1GV construct , 2 . 7 kb of upstream sequence from the Arabidopsis RCH1 gene ( Casamitjana - Martinez et al . , 2003 ) was fused to the GV coding sequence ; the resulting construct also contained a UAS - ERGFP or UAS - GUS reporter engineered in the pGREENII - 0029 vector . For prp3GV and hsp18 . 2GV constructs , 2 kb of Arabidopsis the PRP3 gene promoter region or the Arabidopsis HSP18 . 2 promoter sequence was subcloned before the GV coding sequence in the pGREENII - 0029 vector with a UAS - GUS reporter . To generate UAS - ARF1 - WT , UAS - ARF1 - Q71L , UAS - ARF1 - T31N , and UAS - ROP2 - G14V plant transforma - tion constructs , ARF1 cDNA , ARF1 - Q71L , ARF1 - T31N , and ROP2 - G14V were subcloned into a UAS cassette engineered in pGREENII - 0229 , and these constructs were transformed directly into the GV lines . For the EYFP - ROP2 protein fusion , the EYFP coding sequence was fused in frame to N terminus of the Arabidopsis ROP2 gene in pGREENII - 0229 vector between 1 . 8 kb of the ROP2 promoter sequence and 400 bp of the ROP2 3 9 - untranslated region . PIN2 - EGFP was generated by insertion of EGFP into PIN2 ( Luschnig et al . , 1998 ; Muller et al . , 1998 ) genomic fragment ( nucleotides (cid:1) 2157 to 4380 from ATG ) at position 2312 . Its functionality was veriﬁed by the complementation of the eir1 - 1 ( pin2 ) agravitropic phenotype ( Luschnig et al . , 1998 ) . All the constructs were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C1 ( GV3101 ) with the pSoup plasmid ( http : / / www . pgreen . ac . uk ) byelectroporation . PlanttransformationwasdoneinArabidopsisColumbia ecotype using the ﬂoral - dip method ( Clough and Bent , 1998 ) . Histochemical Analysis of GUS Activity Embryos and small seedlings were immersed in the staining solution ( 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer , pH 7 . 2 , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 . 5 mM potassium ferricyanide , 1 . 5 mM potassium ferrocyanide , and 1 . 5 mg / mL X - glucoronide ) and incubated in the dark at 37 8 C . After staining , all the samples were cleared in 8 : 3 : 1 chloral hydrate : distilled water : glycerol and visualized using Nomarski optics on a Zeiss ( Jena , Germany ) Axioskop 2 microscope with a Nikon ( Tokyo , Japan ) DXM1200 digital camera . Particle Bombardment – Mediated Transient Expression in Onion Epidermal Cells For particle bombardment , all plasmids were ampliﬁed in Escherichia coli strain and puriﬁed using plasmid midi or mini kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) . Onion ( Allium cepa ) bulb scale epidermis was bombarded with gold particles coated with plasmids using a Bio - Rad ( Hercules , CA ) PDS - 1000 / He particle delivery system . Bombarded specimens were incubated in water before CLSM analysis . Inhibitor Treatments , FM4 - 64 Staining , and Analyses in Live Roots BFA treatments were performed as described previously ( Grebe et al . , 2003 ) . For FM4 - 64 stainings , onion epidermis or Arabidopsis seedlings were incubated in 2 mL of distilled water containing 5 m M FM4 - 64 for indicated periods at room temperature . Stained samples were washed twice with water and underwent heat shock treatment , or were directly observed by CLSM and / or two - photon LSM . Microscopy GFP , YFP , and CFP seedlings were visualized using a Leica ( Wetzlar , Germany ) MZ FLIII ﬂuorescence stereomicroscope equipped with GFP andYFPﬁlters . Propidiumiodide ( 10 m g / mLindistilledwater ) wasusedto stain the cell walls of living root cells ( red signal ) . Two - photon LSM and CLSM were used as described ( Grebe et al . , 2003 ) .
