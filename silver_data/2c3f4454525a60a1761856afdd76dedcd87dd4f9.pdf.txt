Biochemical and Immunochemical Analysis of Rat Brain Dynamin Interaction with Microtubules and Organelles In Vivo and In Vitro Robin Scaife and Robert L . Margolis The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center , Seattle , Washington 98104 Abstract . We have purified a 100 - kD rat brain protein that has microtubule cross - linking activity in vitro , and have determined that it is dynamin , a putative microtubule - associated motility protein . We find that dynamin appears to be specific to neuronal tissue where it is present in both soluble and particulate tis - sue fractions . In the cytosol it is abundant , represent - ing as much as 1 . 5 % of the total extractable protein . Dynamin appears to be in particulate material due to association with a distinct subcellular membrane frac - tion . Surprisingly , by immunofluorescence analysis of PC12 cells we find that dynamin is distributed uni - formly throughout the cytoplasm with no apparent microtubule association in either interphase , mitotic , or taxol - treated cells . Upon nerve growth factor ( NGF ) induction of PC12 cell differentiation into neu - rons , dynamin levels increase approximately twofold . In the cell body , the distribution of dynamin again re - mains clearly distinct from that of tubulin , and in axons , where microtubules are numerous and ordered into bundles , dynamin staining is sparse and punctate . On the other hand , in the most distal domain of growth cones , where there are relatively few microtu - bules , dynarnin is particularly abundant . The dynamin staining of neurites is abolished by extraction of the cells with detergent under conditions that preserve microtubules , suggesting that dynarnin in neurites is associated with membranes . We conclude that dyna - min is a neuronal protein that is specifically associated with as yet unidentified vesicles . It is possible , but un - proven , that it may link vesicles to microtubules for transport in differentiated axons . M ICROTUBULES frequently perform functions that require their coalescence into ordered arrays , and their specific association with a variety of subcel - lular organelles . These linkages most likely result from the specific association of the polymer with proteins of special - ized function . Among the brain - derived mierotubule - associated proteins ( MAPs ) , L some have been reported to induce linkage be - tween microtubules and intermediate filaments ( Bloom and Vallee , 1983 ) or with F - actin ( Griffith and Pollard , 1978 ) . The well - characterized MAPs , tau and MAP2 , induce microtubule bundles after eDNA overexpression or mieroin - jection in cultured cells ( Kanai et al . , 1989 ; Lewis et al . , 1989 ) , and , for MAP2 , a putative carboxy terminal domain that could function in dimerization has been suggested as the cause of this bundling effect ( Lewis and Cowan , 1990 ) . Other MAPs have also been reported to cross - link between microtubules in vitro ( Aamodt et al . , 1989 ; Campbell et al . , 1989 ; Hollenbeck and Chapman , 1986 ; Turner and Mar - golis , 1984 ) . In addition to those MAPs that apparently play structural roles on microtubules by stabilizing and organizing the poly - 1 .

Biocherni - eal and immunofluorescenee studies have identified kinesin as an important mechanochemieal enzyme involved in microtubule - directed organelle movement ( Vale et al . , 1985 ; Hollenbeck , 1989 ; Pfister et al . , 1989 ) . Additionally , several proteins have been identified in a number of lower eukary - otes , and Drosophila , with presumed motility functions and substantial domain homologies to kinesin ( Enos and Morris , 1990 ; Meluh and Rose , 1990 ; Endow et al . , 1990 ; McDonald and Goldstein , 1990 ) . Cytoplasmic dynein is also a likely candidate for a variety of intraeeUular microtubule - based motility events , ranging from axonal vesicular trans - port to mitotic chromosome segregation ( Paschal and Vallee , 1987 ; Pfarr et al . , 1990 ; Steuer et al . , 1990 ) . Recently , Shpetner and Vallee ( 1989 ) have isolated a microtubule bun - dling protein dynamin , which they characterized as a third type of putative mierotubule - based motor protein . Several proteins form cross - links between microtubules and appear to induce ATP driven interpolymer sliding in vitro . Both dynein , the motor protein of axonemes , and dy - namin have the capacity to link between mierotubule poly - mers in vitro ( Goodenough and Heuser , 1984 ; Shpetner and Vallee , 1989 ) and to cause one polymer to slide relative to another ( Sale and Satir , 1977 ; Shpetner and Vallee , 1989 ) . © The Rockefeller University Press , 0021 - 9525 / 90 / 12 / 3023 / 11 $ 2 . 00 The Journal of CeU Biology , Volume 111 ( No . 6 , Pt . 2 ) , Dec . 1990 3023 - 3033 3023 on J u l y 13 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m It is thus evident that microtubule cross - linking may be gener - ated by proteins with other than purely structural roles . In the case of dynein , it is clear that both microtubule cross - linking and motor behavior are interdependent processes with physiological meaning for flagellar motility . Cross - linking by associated proteins can involve apparently specific interactions with micrombules . Both the cytoplasmic homo - logue of dynein , MAP1C ( Paschal et al . , 1987 ) , and dynamin ( Shpetner and Vallee , 1989 ) appear to generate ordered micrombule bundles ( Amos , 1989 ; Shpetner and Vallee , 1989 ) . We have previously demonstrated extensive bundling of rat brain - derived microtubules in the presence of the microtubule stabilizing drug taxol , and we have shown that the activity was ATP sensitive and correlated with the pres - ence of a 100 - kD doublet protein ( Tamer and Margolis , 1984 ) . It is evident that the characteristics of this protein and those of the recently described dynamin are strikingly simi - lar . We have examined this possibility and now confirm that the 100 - kD protein we described is a rat brain homologue of dynamin . In this report , we show that rat brain dynamin may be purified by a rapid procedure , incorporating an N - 6 - 1inked ATP affinity column that binds dynamin with substantial dis - crimination . We confirm the previous report ( Shpetner and Vallee , 1989 ) that dynamin cross - links microtubules in an ATP sensitive manner , and copurifies with microtubules through in vitro assembly cycles . Additionally , we have generated a specific polyclonal an - tiserum against rat brain dynamin . We use the antibody to demonstrate that dynamin is a major neuronal protein and is substantially membrane associated . By immunofluores - cence assay , it is shown that dynamin has no apparent associ - ation with microtubules in the cell body or in mitotic spin - dles . It further shows no close association with microtubules in axons but rather is present as detergent sensitive foci in axons and accumulates in growth cones . These data together might suggest a neurite specific function for dynamin in the motility of as yet unidentified vesicles upon microtubules in axons but evidence for specific association with microtu - bules is weak at best . The role of dynamin as a motor protein is still unresolved . Dynamin does not induce ATP dependent sliding of microtubules on coverslips ( Shpetner and Vallee , 1989 ) , nor does it exhibit ATPase activity in the absence of crude extract factors ( Shpetner and Vallee , 1989 ) . The possi - bility therefore exists that the in vitro association of dynamin with microtubules may be irrelevant to its true intracellular function . Materials and Methods Microtubule Protein Preparation Fresh rat brains were homogenized in MME buffer ( 100 mM Mes , 1 mM MgSO4 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 02 % sodium azide , pH 6 . 8 ) at 2 mi / g of tissue . After centrifugation at 4°C for 30 rain at 150 , 000 g , micmtubule assembly was induced in the clarified supernatant by adding 10 % ( vol / vol ) DMSO and warmin ~ tO 30°C . The resulting micmtubules were collected by cen - trifugation through I ml of MME containing 20 % glycerol ( vol / vol ) for 30 rain at 150900 g ( 30°C ) . Pure tubulin was prepared from beef brain micrombule protein that was recycled according to previously published procedures ( Margolis et ai . , 1986 ) . Tubulin was prepared from three cycle - purified microtubule protein by passage through a phosphocellulose chromatography column ( Wil ] iamg and Detrich , 1979 ) and a subsequent cycle of assembly ( in MME buffer plus 20 % DMSO and 0 . 25 mM GTP ) at 30°C . Dynamin Purifu : ation Dynamin was purified by first assembling rat brain micmtubules from the crude extract in MME buffer . Pelleted microtubules were disassembled by shearing with a 25 gauge needle and exposure to 4°C for 30 rain , and the resulting solution was centrifuged at 12 , 000 g for 10 min . The supernatant was loaded onto a DEAE - cellulose ( Whatman Inc . , Clifton , NJ ) column and the resulting flow - through fraction was then loaded onto an ATP - agarose column with N - 6 linkage ( No . A9264 ; Sigma Chemical Co . , St . Louis , MO ) . Dynamin was eluted with 0 . 2 M NaCI in MME . Peak fractions were drop frozen in liquid nitrogen , and stored at - 70°C . lmmunofluorescence Microscopy of Individual Microtubules Samples containing taxol - stabilized pure mbulin microtubules and dynamin F / gure 1 .

Microtubules were as - sembled from purified tubulin ( 0 . 8 mg / ml ) with GTP ( 0 . 1 mM ) in MME buffer plus 10 % DMSO for 20 rain at 30°C . After add - ing taxol ( 20 / zM ) to stabilize the microtu - bules , 1 / d aliquots were incubated for 15 min at 30°C with 9 / ~ 1 of ATP - agarose - pu - rifled dynamin ( , , o . 015 mg / ml final concen - tration ) and with or without Mg2 + - ATP ( 5 raM ) . Samples were fixed at 30°C in MME buffer containing 20 % glycerol and 1 % ghtaraldehyde . After dilution , fixed mi - crotubules were spun onto glass coverslips and processed for immunofluorescence mi - croscopy with anti - / ~ mbulin serum as de - scribed in Materials and Methods .

Aliquots were then diluted with buffer and centrifuged onto coverslips at 15 , 000 g for 60 min , and subsequently treated successively with 0 . 5 mg / ml NaBI - I4 , 1 : 200 mouse anti - ~ tubulin serum ( East Acres Biological , South - bridge , MA ) and fluorescein - conjugated goat anti - mouse antibodies ( 1 : 200 dilution , TAGO , Inc . , Burlingame , CA ) . Coverslips were mounted on glass slides with PBS containing 90 % glycerol and 50 mg / ml N - propylgallate , and viewed with a Leitz Ortholux microscope equipped for epifluorescence microscopy . Cell Culture and Immunofluorescence Microscopy Rat neuronal PCI2 cells were grown on a collagen - treated substrate in DME medium plus 5 % FCS and 1 % heat - treated horse serum . Cells were induced to differentiate with 100 ag / ml nerve growth factor ( NGF ) ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) , and after 3 - 7 d in NGF they were either lysed in SDS containing buffer and immediately heated to 100°C ( for subsequent electrophoretic analysis ) or prepared for immunofluoresceuce microscopy by fixation at 37°C for 15 rain in MME buffer containing 2 . 5 % pexaformaldehyde , 0 . 1 % glutaralde - hyde . Texol ( obtained from Dr . Sugness , National Institutes of Health ) treatment of cells was at 10 / ~ M for 18 h before fixation . After permeab ' diza - tion with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 for 15 rain , coverslips were immersed in PBS containing 0 . 5 mg / ml sodium borohydride , rinsed in PBS containing 0 . 05 % Tween 20 , and blocked with 2 % FBS before incubation with antibodies . The anti - cx and anti - fl tubuiin sera ( diluted 1 : 250 in PBS plus 1 mg / ml BSA ) used ware mouse ascites fluids from Amersham Corp . ( Arlington Heights , IL ) . The antidynamiq serum was an affinity - purified rabbit serum . Poly - clonai antidynamin sera were produced by injection of electrophoretically purified 100 - kD antigen as previously described ( Margolis et al . , 1986 ) and a ~ nity - purified antiserum to dynamin was obtained by exposure of nitrocel - lulose strips from blots containing eloctrophorefically separated dynamin ( first purified by DEAE cellulose and ATP - agarose chromatography ) , to dy - namin antiserum , and removal of the dynamin - speciflc antibodies with 50 mM giycine - HCl , pH 2 . 2 . Control affinity - purified antiserum was obtained from nitrocellulose blots by washing strips that did not contain dynamin . Coverslips were then incubated with 1 : 250 diluted rhodamine - conjugated goat anti - rabbit ( TAGO , Inc . ) and then in sequence , rhodamine - conjugated swine anti - goat sera , followed by 2 % normal goat serum and 1 : 250 diluted fluorescein - conjugated goat anti - mouse serum ( TAGO , Inc . ) . Coverslips were mounted on glass slides with PBS containing 90 % glycerol and 50 mg / ml N - propylgallate , and viewed with a Nikon microscope equipped for confocal microscopy ( MRC - 500 ; Bio - Rad Laboratories , Cambridge , MA ) . Fixation with methanol at - 20°C resulted in qualitatively similar images to those presented here , as did use of fluorescein conjugated goat anti - rabbit ( TAGO , Inc . ) and Texas red - conjugated goat anti - mouse ( TAGO , Inc . ) secondary sera .

During cen - trifugation , we employed a linear 12 - ml 0 . 05 - 1 . 2 M sucrose gradient for each one milliliter of lysate . The gradient fractions containing dynamin , as determined by immunoblotting procedure , were pooled and loaded onto a 1 . 5 × 70 - cm controlled pore glass bead column for further fractionation . Sucrose gradient and controlled pore glass column fractions were processed for electron microscopy as described ( Huttner et al . , 1983 ) . Other Procedures PAGE was performed using 8 % polyacrylamide , 0 . 1 % SDS gels as previ - ously described ( Laemmli , 1970 ) . Molecular mass marker positions ( 205 , 116 , 97 , 66 , 45 , and 32 kD ) are indicated by horizontal bars alongside the gels . Immunoblotting was essentially according to Towbin et aL ( 1979 ) .

Protein concentra - tions were determined by ODs ~ o m assay with bicinchoninic acid ( Pierce Chemical Co . , Rockford IL ) . Results Purification of a lO0 - kD Rat Brain Antigen and Its Identification as Dynamin This laboratory has reported that a protein doublet of 100 kD is highly enriched on microtubules assembled in vitro from rat brain tissue in the presence of taxol ( Turner and Margolis , 1984 ) . Further , the presence of the 100 - kD pro - tein correlates with ATP sensitive bundling of isolated microtubules ( Turner and Margolis , 1984 ) . The ATP sensi - tive bundling led us to suspect the 100 - kD protein might bind with high affinity to ATP . We therefore have made use of ATP affinity matrices for the purification of this 100 - kD species . We have now devised a simple three step purification proce - dure that incorporates the ATP affinity column , and that yields a nearly homogeneous 100 - kD protein doublet ( Fig . 1 A ) . In the first step , soluble 100 - kD protein associates and copellets with microtubules assembled from a rat brain crude extract ( Fig . 1 A , lanes I and 2 ) . The resolubilized pel - let is then applied to a DEAE ion exchange column , from which we recover the 100 - kD doublet , but no other major MAPs ( i . e . , MAP1 and MAP2 ) , in the flow - through eluate ( Fig . 1 A , lane 3 ) . This eluate is then applied to an N - 6 link - age ATP affinity column , and the 100 - kD doublet is recov - ered from this column as a near homogeneous preparation at 0 . 2 M salt ( Fig . 1 A , lane 4 ) . As predicted from the previ - ous study ( Turner and Margolis , 1984 ) , the three step purified 100 - kD protein cross - links pure tubulin microtu - bules in vitro in an ATP sensitive manner ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . We have developed a rabbit polyclonal antiserum against electrophoretically purified 100 - kD protein . On Western blots , this serum recognizes a single doublet antigen in crude rat brain extract ( Fig . 1 B , lane / ) , of the same apparent molecular mass as the three step purified antigen ( Fig . 1 B , lane 4 ) . The similarity of mass and cross - linking properties of this 100 - kD protein to the recently described beef brain microtu - bule motor protein , dynamin ( Shpetner and VaUee , 1989 ) , suggested that the 100 - kD protein might be rat dynamin . We have used antisera to probe the relationship between these proteins . For this purpose , a blot of crude rat brain extract ( Fig . 1 C , lane / ) and three step purified antigen ( Fig . 1 C , lane 4 ) was sent to the laboratory of Dr . VaUee where it was probed with antiserum raised against dynamin . The major bands detected with this serum correspond to a 100 - kD dou - blet in the crude extract , and the three step purified 100 - kD protein ( Fig . 1 C ) . Additionally , our antiserum to the 100 - kD protein reacts strongly with purified dynamin on hi - The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 111 , 1990 3026 on J u l y 13 , 2017 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Figure 4 .

The resulting pellet was resuspended in MME buffer and subjected to electrophoresis ( lane 7 ) . The high speed supernatant ( lane 6 ) was incubated at 30°C for 30 min with 10 % DMSO to assemble microtubules and centrifuged again at high speed for 30 min at 30°C . The resulting snpernatant and pellet fractions were subjected to electrophoresis ( lanes 8 and 9 , respectively ) .

Vallee ( data not shown ) . Therefore , the 100 - kD protein species that we have identified is clearly the same protein as beef brain dynamin . We hereafter refer to this protein as dynamin . By quantitative analysis of our blots , we have determined that dynamin represents as much as 1 . 5 % of the total extractable protein in rat brain . For this purpose , soluble dynamin con - tent was quantitated by Phosphor Imager analysis of crude rat brain soluble extract and highly purified dynamin West - ern blot signals , and then corrected for protein content in each of the gel lanes analyzed . Distribution of Rat Brain Dynamin To determine the tissue distribution of dynamin , we have analyzed extracts from seven different rat tissues by Western blot assay using the polyclonal serum ( Fig . 3 ) . Assaying whole cell extracts that were loaded on an equal protein basis ( Fig . 3 A ) , we found high levels of dynamin in both brain and spinal cord , while all other tissues tested negative for the presence of dynamin ( Fig . 3 B ) . A , u60 - kD antigen is also present in these samples . This antigen is probably human keratin , since its detection is dependent on the presence of mercaptoethanol in the sample buffer ( Shapiro , 1987 ) . Affinity - purified dynamin antibody , used below for immuno - fluorescence assays , does not recognize this 60 - kD band . The dynamin epitope ( s ) recognized by this polyclonal anti - body are clearly neuron specific , but it cannot be ruled out that other isotypes of the protein exist in other tissues .

By performing sequential centrifugation of whole rat brain tissue homogenate at low , medium , and high speed we have found , surprisingly , that dynamin is relatively abundant in all three particulate fractions ( Fig . 4 ) . After a low speed ( 3 , 000 g ) centrifugation of the homogenate , , , o70 % of the dynamin was recovered in the particulate fraction ( Fig . 4 , A and B , lane 3 ) . The low speed supematant ( Fig . 4 , A and B , lane 2 ) was centrifuged at medium speed ( 18 , 000 g ) . A substantial proportion of the dynamin was again recovered in the particulate fraction ( Fig . 4 , A and B , lane 5 ) . The me - dium speed supernatant ( Fig . 4 , A and B , lane 4 ) was centri - fuged at high speed ( 150 , 000 g ) . Again , dynamin was recov - ered in the particulate fraction ( Fig . 4 , A and B , lane 7 ) . The high speed supernatant ( Fig . 4 , A and B , lane 6 ) was incu - bated at 30°C for 30 rain with 10 % DMSO , to assemble mi - crotubules , and centrifuged again at high speed . Nearly all the supernatant dynamin was then recovered along with the microtubules in the pelleted fraction ( Fig . 4 , A and B , lane 9 ) . This soluble dynamin associates quantitatively with mi - crotubules through successive in vitro assembly - disassembly cycles ( data not shown ) . We have also observed quantitative retention of soluble purified dynamin on microtubules in the presence of millimolar ATP ( Fig . 4 C ) , in accord with re - suits of Shpetner and Vallee ( 1989 ) , despite the relaxation of dynamin dependent microtubule bundling at this ATP con - centration ( Fig . 2 B ; Shpetner and Vallee , 1989 ) . A substantial proportion of rat brain dynamin is thus in a particulate form . As dynamin is suggested to be a putative microtubule motor protein ( Shpetner and Vallee , 1989 ) , it was of interest to assay for its potential membrane associa - tion . We began analysis by isolation of rat brain synapto - somes , which contain high levels of dynamin . Upon hypo - osmotic lysis of a synaptosome preparation , we recovered synaptosome associated dynamin in a high speed particulate fraction ( data not shown ) . This material was fractionated further by sucrose density gradient centrifugation ( data not shown ) , and finally by controlled pore glass bead chroma - tography ( Fig . 5 ) . Western blot analysis of the column frac - tion demonstrates that dynamin is specifically associated with a subfraetion of membranous material distinct from the synaptic vesicle peak ( Fig . 5 B ) . This conclusion is drawn both on the basis of the absence of synapsin from the dyna - min rich fraction ( Fig . 5 B ) and the finding that the dynamin rich fraction consists primarily of large membranous mate - rial ( Fig . 5 C ) , in contrast to the small vesicles comprising the synapsin rich fraction ( Fig . 5 D ) .

Exposure of the cells to NGF induces neu - rite outgrowth ( Greene and Tischler , 1976 ) and increases the dynamin level approximately twofold ( Fig . 6 B ) . We have applied the antidynamin antibody , affinity purified from nitrocellulose blots , for immunofluorescence analysis ofintracellular dynamin distribution ( Figs . 7 - 10 ) . At the earliest stages of neurite extension dynamin was detect - able as a nearly uniform punctate stain throughout the cytoplasm ( Fig . 7 A ) i ~ r contrast to the distinctly filamentous tubulin staining ( Fig . 7 B ) . The staining with antidynamin antibody is , however , specific since substitution with a nega - tive control antiserum ( see Materials and Methods ) yielded no signal ( Fig . 7 E ) . The difference between dynamin and tubulin staining was particularly apparent in the leading ruffles of growth cones where dynamin was very abundant relative to tubulin ( Fig , 7 , A and B , arrows ) . We have neither thus far observed a convincing codistribution of dynamin with interphase microtubules in the cell bodies of these cells . For the cell shown in Fig . 7 ( C and D ) , differentiation of cells was more advanced . As in earlier stages of differentiation , dynamin staining was present as a punctate pattern through - out the cytoplasm and in the neuritic extensions ( Fig . 7 C ) . Dynamin staining was particularly intense relative to the tubulin signal in the distal portions of neuritic extensions ( Fig . 7 , C and D , open arrows ) . Additionally , in view of the reports on in vitro microtubule bundling by dynamin , it was surprising to find relatively low levels of dynamin stain in areas of the neurites where tubulin staining was strongest , and where microtubules have a bundled appearance ( Fig . 7 , C and D , solid arrows ) . Although the low levels of dynamin stain in these areas could be a result of epitope masking in the dense microtubule bundles , this is not likely to be the case with a polyclonal serum . Also , we have found that microtubule bundling per se does not mask dynamin epi - topes , as in vitro formed bundles readily stain with our dyna - rain antibody ( data not shown ) . The apparent absence of close association of dynamin with individual microtubules or microtubule bundles in PC12 cells is particularly apparent following taxol treatment ( Fig . 8 ) . Extensive rearrangement and bundling of microtubules occurred after addition of taxol to the culture media ( Fig . 8 B ) . The dynamin staining , on the other hand , remained uni - formly punctate and was clearly not influenced by the dra - matic taxol - induced microtubule rearrangements ( Fig . 8 A ) . The punctate nature of the dynamin stain in PC12 cells and the detection of dynamin in particulate fractions from 1 ' C12 cells ( data not shown ) suggest an association of PC12 cell dynarnin with cellular membranes . Further , the punctate staining of PC12 growth cones by dynamin antibody ( Fig . 7 ) correlates with evidence that dynamin is present in synaptosome - derived membrane fractions ( Fig . 5 ) , suggest - ing that dynamin is present in synaptosomes as a membrane - associated antigen . To distinguish whether the bulk of the dynamin staining in axons is associated with membrane surfaces , we have detergent - extracted ceils before fixation . Detergent treat - ment of cells before fixation generally results in the extrac - tion of membrane - associated antigens and concomitant loss of immunofluorescent staining ( Brown et al . , 1976 ; Hollen - beck , 1989 ; Pfister et al . , 1989 ) , whereas detergent extrac - tion , performed in a microtubule stabilizing buffer ( Osborn and Weber , 1982 ) , has no effect on microtubules or its as - sociated antitubulin staining . Extraction of PC12 cells , after 4 d ( Fig . 9 , A and B ) or 7 d ( data not shown ) in NGF , with 0 . 2 % Triton had no significant effect on antibody staining of microtubules ( Fig . 9 B ) , but substantially attenuated the dy - namin stain ( Fig . 9 A ) . After extraction , neuritic extensions were not stained at all ( Fig . 9 A , arrows ) while , curiously , cell bodies retained much of their uniform dynamin distri - bution . In view of its ability to cross - link and slide on microtu - bules , dynamin would seem to be an attractive candidate for an anaphase B mitotic motor protein . Since the epitopes rec - ognized by our polyclonal antibodies are restricted to neu - ronai tissue ( Fig . 3 ) , we probed for dynamin in the mitotic spindles of PC12 cells in culture . After release from nocoda - zole block , PC12 cells in mitosis were fixed and stained with antidynamin ( Fig . 10 A ) and antitubulin ( Fig . 10 B ) antisera . While mitotic spindles are clearly visible with the antitubu - lin antibody , staining of spindles with antidynamin antise - rum was not apparent . Instead , dynamin appears as a uni - form punctate background characteristic of its appearance in the cell bodies of interphase cells . Although a dynamin homologue may function in these cells in the mitotic spindle , it is clear that the neuronal dynamin is not spindle as - sociated .

Discussion We have purified and characterized a rat brain 100 - kD dou - blet protein that associates with microtubules in vitro and in - duces polymer bundling . This confirms the postulate in our previous work ( Turner and Margolis , 1984 ) that microtubule bundling in vitro is associated with and probably a conse - quence of the specific presence ofa 100 - kD protein . We have determined that this protein is dynamin , a 100 - kD MAP first isolated from beef brain , which has been reported to induce microtubule cross - linking in vitro ( Shpemer and Vallee , 1989 ) . The 100 - kD protein described here is dynamin as determined by cross - identification on Western blots and microtubule binding properties . Dynamin is very abundant in neuronal tissue ( as much as 1 . 5 % of the total soluble pro - tein content ) , but it is not apparent as an antigen in non - neuronal tissue . This suggests that dynamin plays a role in processes specific for neuronal cells . We have developed a simple purification protocol to ob - tain dynamin from rat brain .

On applying a brain crude extract to this column ( not shown ) , we have found that dynamin is by far the most abundant protein eluting in the column specific fraction . We have also developed a polyclonal antiserum against dy - narnin and have used it both to study the association of dyna - min with subcellular fractions in vitro and to determine the distribution of dynamin in cultured cells by immunofluores - cence analysis . Dynamin is abundant in the particulate frac - tion of neuronal tissue and is apparently associated with membranous material . Immunocytochemistry shows dyna - min present in punctate arrays in cells , presumably as - sociated with organelles . The possibility that dynamin may act as a motor protein in mitosis ( Shpetner and Vallee , 1989 ) is not supported by immunofluorescence evidence , which shows that dynamin , like kinesin ( Hollenbeck , 1989 ; Ptister et al . , 1989 ) but unlike cytoplasmic dynein ( Pfarr et al . , 1990 ; Steuer et al . , 1990 ) or STOP ( Margolis et al . , 1990 ) , remains dispersed in the cytoplasm during mitosis . This ob - servation does not of course preclude the possibility that a motor protein substantially homologous to dynamin might perform such a function , but , if so , it does not share epitopes with the neuronal dynamin that we have purified and used for polyclonal antibody production . Dynamin levels increase approximately twofold after NGF treatment of PC12 cells , in contrast to MAPs such as MAP2 and tan , which increase (cid:127)10 - 12 - fold upon NGF treatment ( Drubin et al . , 1985 ) . These MAPs appear to be structural components of neuronal microtubules , since they are uni - formly distributed on polymers ( Bloom and Vallee , 1983 ) . These MAPs appear capable of inducing microtubule bun - dles ( Lewis et al . , 1989 ; Kanai et al . , 1989 ) , apparently through dlmerization ( Lewis and Cowan , 1990 ) . This capac - ity for bundling has been proposed to play . a role in the ob - served bundling of microtubules in axons and dendrites ( Lewis et al . , 1989 ; Kanai et al . , 1989 ) . Purified dynarnin also induces microtubule bundling in vitro , forming bundles that are ATP sensitive . However , it appears unlikely that dy - namin is responsible for microtubule bundling in the axon , since it is sparsely represented among the bundled axonal microtubules . Dynamin appears punctate and randomly dispersed in the cytoplasm , and displays no discernable interaction with the microtubule array of the cell body . Similarly , another presumptive microtubule motor protein , kinesin , appears to be distributed in a dispersed and punctate pattern in the cytoplasm , but kinesin also shows some apparent association along microtubules ( Ptister et ai . , 1989 ; Hollenbeck , 1989 ) . Similarly , in some instances ( particularly in axonal branch points near growth cones ) , immunofluorescence suggests sporadic colocalization of dynamin with microtubules . Therefore , if dynamin can specifically associate with microtubules in the cell , it would appear to result from a specific activation during PC12 cell differentiation . Even in the most favorable cases , however , colocalization of dynamin with microtubules is very limited and most of the protein is dispersed in a punctate in distribution throughout the cell . Any association of dynamin with microtubules must be tran - sitory , since , upon taxol - induced rearrangement and bun - dling of the mlcrotubules , the dynamin remains uniformly dispersed and punctate . This contrasts with MAPIA , which remains superimposed with the microtubules upon taxol treatment of PC12 cells ( Bloom et al . , 1984 ) . In view of the in vitro bundling of microtubules by dynamin , our finding that the neuritic microtubule bundles contain only very little dynamin , if any , is surprising . Of this dynamin only a small fraction can be meaningfully associated with microtubules , since the punctate dynamin evident on neurites is entirely de - tergent extractable whereas , under these conditions , micro - tubules and many of their associated proteins remain . Our finding that dynamin is present in rat brain particulate frac - tions is in agreement with the apparent preferential associa - tion of dynamin with membranes in axons . In distal portions of neurites dynamin is relatively abun - dant , and it appears in growth cones beyond the region con - taining microtubules . The abundance of dynamin at these sites may be due to an accumulation of dynamin containing vesicles after their transport along the neurite microtubules . We have not : yet determined if dynamin is directly involved in transport of these vesicles . As dynamin does not copurify with classical synaptic vesicles , the nature of the dynamin rich organelles visualized in the cell remains to be deter - mined . In summary , despite strong evidence for association ofdy - namin containing vesicles with microtubules in axons , the quantitative association of soluble dynamin with microtu - bules in vitro and the reported in vitro capacity of dynamin to act as a motor protein on microtubules in the presence of other soluble factors ( Shpetner and Vallee , 1989 ) would ar - gue that it could operate as a motor protein for the transport of specific as yet unidentified vesicles on microtubules to - ward the axonal synapse where these dynamin containing vesicles seem to accumulate . Any apparent motor function would appear to be specific to neuronal cells and to overlap with kinesin function ( Vale et al . , 1985 ; Schroer et al . , 1988 ) . It is possible that dynamin and kinesin move different sets of vesicles toward synapses , or that they are distinct for reasons of physiological regulation of vesicle traffic . We would caution against premature judgement , however , with respect to dynamin motor function on microtubules . Unlike dynein or kinesin , dynamin does not move microtubules on glass substrates ( Shpetner and Vallee , 1989 ) , nor does it ex - hibit ATPase activity in the absence of crude factors ( Shpet - ner and Vallee , 1989 ) . Our failure to find it convincingly as - sociated with micrombules in vivo leaves us that much more skeptical as to its potential role in microtubule - based motil - ity , or in microtubule bundling in vivo .
