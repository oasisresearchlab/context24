Review Article Substrate stiffness - dependent exacerbation of endothelial permeability and inflammation : mechanisms and potential implications in ALI and PH ( 2017 Grover Conference Series ) Pratap Karki and Anna A . Birukova Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine , Department of Medicine , University of Maryland Baltimore , School of Medicine , Baltimore , MD , USA Abstract The maintenance of endothelial barrier integrity is absolutely essential to prevent the vascular leak associated with pneumonia , pulmonary edema resulting from inhalation of toxins , acute elevation to high altitude , traumatic and septic lung injury , acute lung injury ( ALI ) , and its life - threatening complication , acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) . In addition to the long - known edemagenic and inflammatory agonists , emerging evidences suggest that factors of endothelial cell ( EC ) mechanical microenvir - onment such as blood flow , mechanical strain of the vessel , or extracellular matrix stiffness also play an essential role in the control of endothelial permeability and inflammation . Recent studies from our group and others have demonstrated that substrate stiffening causes endothelial barrier disruption and renders EC more susceptible to agonist - induced cytoskeletal rearrangement and inflammation . Further in vivo studies have provided direct evidence that proinflammatory stimuli increase lung microvascular stiffness which in turn exacerbates endothelial permeability and inflammation and perpetuates a vicious circle of lung inflammation . Accumulating evidence suggests a key role for RhoA GTPases signaling in stiffness - dependent mechanotransduction mechanisms defining EC permeability and inflammatory responses . Vascular stiffening is also known to be a key contributor to other cardio - vascular diseases such as arterial pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) , although the precise role of stiffness in the development and progression of PH remains to be elucidated . This review summarizes the current understanding of stiffness - dependent regulation of pulmonary EC permeability and inflammation , and discusses potential implication of pulmonary vascular stiffness alterations at macro - and microscale in development and modulation of ALI and PH .

The overall regulation of endothelial permeability is governed not only by bioactive soluble mediators , mechanical forces , and cell – cell interactions but also by the stiﬀness of the substrate to which EC are adhered . 1 , 2 The role of the surrounding ECM on the regulation of EC response to various biochemical or mechanical stimuli has recently gained signiﬁcant attention with the ﬁndings that substrate stiﬀness per se is suﬃcient to cause EC permeability . 1 , 3 , 4 The matrix stiﬀness in lung parenchyma of healthy lungs is in the range of 0 . 5 – 3 kPa , but increases six - to eightfold in pulmonary ﬁbrosis . The range of natural stiﬀness microenvironment for other cells in the body is in the range of 1 kPa in the brain to (cid:2) 30 kPa in pre - calciﬁed bone and (cid:2) 100 kPa in calciﬁed sites of atherosclerotic thoracic arteries ( Fig . 1 ) . These ﬁndings highlight an important , although under - studied , role of sub - strate stiﬀness in pathophysiology of many diseases and Corresponding author : Anna A .

We will also discuss potential mechanisms of stiﬀness - dependent modulation of EC permeability and inﬂammation with focus on RhoA GTPase - mediated signaling . Lastly , we will brieﬂy review the role of stiﬀness in the development and progression of pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) . EC cellular stiffness and endothelial permeability Since the dynamic actomyosin contractility and cytoskeletal reorganization controls EC permeability , a direct inter - action between EC and ECM plays a vital role in this pro - cess . 2 , 18 , 19 Multiple studies have demonstrated that the microenvironment of EC governs its many cellular features including adhesion , cell – cell contact , migration , and force generation . 20 – 22 The studies have shown that EC develop stiﬀening response to shear stress , tumor necrosis factor - a ( TNF - a ) , and oxidized low - density lipoprotein . 23 – 25 The stiﬀness of surrounding ECM and strength of cell – cell inter - actions also deﬁne the intrinsic levels of basal actomyosin contraction and stiﬀness of vascular EC . 26 , 27 Analysis of EC force generation and intracellular stiﬀness distribution in pulmonary EC stimulated with barrier - protective and bar - rier - disruptive agents has been performed using traction force microscopy ( TFM ) and atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) and related to endothelial permeability responses . 28 – 31 These studies showed that barrier - disruptive agonists activated EC force generation and increased stiﬀ - ness in the central region ( Fig . 2 ) . In turn , barrier - protective agents decreased overall EC contractile response and stiﬀness in the central regions and caused redistribution of cytoskeleton leading to formation of peripheral actomyosin rim and increased local cytoskeletal stiﬀness at the periphery of the cell . Consistently , the attenuation of agonist - induced EC permeability by barrier - protective agonists well corre - lated with the reduction of EC contraction and decreased cellular stiﬀening in the central part . 28 Substrate stiffness and endothelial permeability Changes in endothelial mechanical microenvironment take place under physiological circumstances and appear to play an important role in endothelial function . For example , age - related intimal stiﬀening increases EC permeability and leukocyte transmigration in atherosclerosis by upregulating cell contractility and disrupting cell – cell junctions . 4 These observations suggested that the age - dependent increase in ECM stiﬀness , a normal phenomenon of aging , directly induces EC permeability and might play a role in the pro - gression of vascular disease . Likewise , traction force micros - copy studies showed that EC monolayers grown on stiﬀer substrates generate higher levels of endothelial contractile forces leading to more robust EC permeability . 1 Thrombin treatment of pulmonary EC monolayers grown on stiﬀer substrates increased generation of traction forces and enhanced formation of intercellular gaps in EC , as com - pared to the cells grown on softer substrates . EC grown on stiﬀer substrates showed disrupted adherens junctions and an appropriate level of ECM stiﬀness ( 4 kPa ) was essen - tial to maintain EC barrier function . 32 Pulmonary EC grown on three diﬀerent grades of stiﬀness - very low ( 0 . 55 kPa ) , physiologically relevant ( 8 . 6 kPa ) , and very high ( 42 kPa ) showed that the formation of stress ﬁber increases with increasing substrate stiﬀness , and thrombin induces the maximal stress ﬁber formation in the cells grown on very high stiﬀness matrices . 3 In support of these ﬁndings , a recent study has shown that thrombin or TNF - a treatment increases traction force , monolayer ten - sion , and permeability in EC grown on stiﬀer substrates . 33 Maximal barrier disruptive and contractile response to thrombin in EC grown on high stiﬀness substrates was Fig . 1 . Stiffness induces cytoskeletal reorganization . ( a ) The stiffness varies among the tissues according to their physiological needs with softer tissues having low and harder tissue such as bone having higher elastic modulus ( figure modified from Janmey and Miller 89 ) . Endothelial cells have (cid:2) 1200 – 2000Pa elastic modulus . ( b ) Stiffness causes the cytoskeletal remodeling via integrin signaling with elongated focal adhesion ( FA ) , increased traction force , and formation of actin stress fibers . 2 | Role of stiffness in ALI and PH Karki and Birukova associated with high and sustained activation of Rho signal - ing . Interestingly , although EC grown on lower substrate stiﬀness substrates developed less pronounced Rho activa - tion at early time points of response to thrombin , they exhibited higher levels of Rac GTPase activation at later time points after thrombin challenge ; the signaling event consistent with the eﬃciency of EC barrier recovery . 3 Substrate stiﬀness in coordination with force - transduction signaling by VE - Cadherin is also suggested to increase cell contractility and gap formation . 34 A recent study has sug - gested a role of gap junction - mediated cell – cell interaction in the regulation of EC stiﬀness . 35 These recent ﬁndings clearly indicate that the interplay between substrate stiﬀness and mechanotransduction signaling modulate endothelial permeability . Interestingly , inhibition of lysyl oxidase , an enzyme involved in collagen and elastin crosslinking and overall stiﬀening of the lung tissue , reduced pulmonary vas - cular leak in mice . 32 Mechanism of stiffness - induced endothelial permeability EC respond to the change in their microenvironment by cytoskeletal remodeling and cell contractility that modulates endothelial permeability . 28 The enhanced adhesion and spreading of EC on stiﬀer substrate is mediated by integrins signaling with cytoskeleton reorganization and actomyosin contractility . 26 , 36 – 39 The Rho signaling pathway is the major regulator of actomyosin contraction and cell - matrix adhe - sion . 2 , 40 Rho and its downstream eﬀector Rho - associated kinase ( ROCK ) induce the phosphorylation of myosin light chain ( MLC ) either by directly phosphorylating it or by phosphorylation and suppression of myosin phosphatase activity . 41 – 43 The increased MLC phosphorylation leads to cell contraction , F - actin stress ﬁber formation , and ultim - ately causes endothelial barrier dysfunction . 44 , 45 The gener - ation of Rho - activated contractile forces , stress ﬁber formation , and increased number of focal adhesions have all been associated with stiﬀness . 1 , 45 , 46 In addition to the regulation of EC contractility , the activation of Rho path - way with increased ROCK activity is shown to enhance matrix stiﬀness - induced ﬁbroblast contractility and myoﬁ - broblast diﬀerentiation . 16 It has been demonstrated that the increased traction forces generated on EC grown on stiﬀer substrate is depend - ent on the activation of Rho kinase , ROCK . 1 In turn , EC grown on stiﬀer substrate ( 11 kPa ) compared to those on softer substrate ( 1 . 2 kPa ) revealed a high level of throm - bin - induced Rho kinase activation . 1 Consistently , inhibition of Rho kinase activity with ROCK selective pharmaco - logical inhibitor , Y - 27632 , decreased basal traction forces and prevented thrombin - induced cellular gap formations . The role of Rho signaling pathway in stiﬀness - induced endothelial permeability was further conﬁrmed in another study where EC grown on hydrogels of stiﬀer substrate ( 10 kPa ) had robustly increased Rho activity compared to the cells grown on stiﬀer substrate ( 2 . 5 kPa ) . 4 Again , inhib - ition of Rho activation with Y - 27632 decreased traction forces uniformly on EC grown on all diﬀerent levels of matrices and also decreased stiﬀness - induced endothelial permeability . 4 The decrease of stiﬀness - caused permeability was observed with siRNA mediated depletion of ROCK and Fig . 2 . EC stiffness changes by agonists and antagonists . Barrier - disruptive and - protective agents change the local stiffness distribution differ - ently . Human pulmonary EC were grown on glass coverslips and elasticity was measured using atomic force microscopy . Thrombin increased elastic modulus at the center ( Ec ) while iloprost increased it at the cell periphery ( Ep ) . 28 Pulmonary Circulation Volume 8 Number 2 | 3 pharmacological inhibition of ROCK abolished the desta - bilization of cell – cell junctions , thereby improving the endo - thelial barrier function in mice . A growing body of evidence from multiple studies has further established the crucial role of Rho in mediating stiﬀness - induced endothelial permeabil - ity . For example , the activation of Src - Vav2 - RhoA signaling axis is shown to regulate stiﬀness - induced cytoskeletal organization and proliferation of EC . 47 Likewise , ROCK - mediated contractility facilitates the increase in EC mono - layer tension and permeability in response to thrombin and TNF - a . 33 Substrate stiffness and inflammation As mentioned above , substrate stiﬀness exacerbates the eﬀects of pro - inﬂammatory cytokine TNF - a on EC perme - ability . More importantly , substrate stiﬀness has been dir - ectly implicated in inﬂammation since increased substrate stiﬀness is shown to promote leukocyte transendothelial migration . 4 , 48 In turn , the adhesion , spreading , and migra - tion of leukocytes on EC is determined by EC stiﬀness - dependent clustering of ICAM1 where integrins mediate the mechanosensitive response of leukocytes . 38 , 49 , 50 As dis - cussed earlier , endothelial stiﬀness is directly regulated by the stiﬀness of underlying substrate and therefore increases in inﬂammatory settings . These mechanisms are summarized in Fig . 3 . Patients and animal models of lung dysfunction show the decrease in lung compliance which might reﬂect a signiﬁcant alteration of mechanical properties of lung tissues . Bacterial pathogens as well as bacteria - derived endotoxins stimulate the production of ECM proteins by lung cells 51 , 52 leading to increased expression of ECM proteins ( ﬁbronectin , colla - gen ) and their deposition in the inﬂamed lung and further stiﬀening of the lung . 53 , 54 Tissue remodeling and increased ECM production has been observed as a prominent feature in the course of ALI . Direct measurements of microvascular wall stiﬀness had been performed in the murine model of LPS - induced lung inﬂammation . Atomic force microscopy measurements in precisely cut live lung slices showed that LPS increased peri - vascular stiﬀness in lung and stimulated expression of ECM proteins : ﬁbronectin , collagen I , and ECM crosslinking enzyme , lysyl oxidase . 55 Increased stiﬀness and ECM remodeling exacerbated LPS - induced inﬂammation reﬂected by the enhanced expression of adhesive surface molecules : intercellular adhesion molecule ( ICAM - 1 ) and vascular cell adhesion protein 1 ( VCAM - 1 ) along with the increased pro - duction of IL - 8 by lung EC . 55 Increased expression of EC surface adhesion molecules facilitated the adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes , an early key event of inﬂam - mation . 56 Stiﬀness - augmented EC inﬂammatory responses to LPS and TNF - a were also conﬁrmed in EC cultures grown on compliant matrices of diﬀerent stiﬀness . Attenuation of LPS - induced inﬂammation by lipoxin analog 15 - epi - lipoxin A4 ( eLXA4 ) inhibited LPS - increased lung stiﬀness and attenuated stiﬀness - dependent activation of EC inﬂammation . These ﬁndings suggest a direct role of matrix stiﬀness in lung inﬂammation and attenuation of local vascular stiﬀness by anti - inﬂammatory agents like lipoxin could be a potential therapeutic for stiﬀness - caused lung dysfunction . Increased vascular endothelial permeability contributes to inﬂammation . For example , destabilization of cell – cell adherens junctions and internalization of EC - speciﬁc adhe - rens junction structural protein VE - cadherin increases endo - thelial permeability and positively regulates the leukocyte transmigration into the vessel wall , a key event to parenchy - mal inﬂammation . 57 , 58 Increased matrix stiﬀness also induced the leukocyte transmigration in TNF - a - stimulated EC . 4 We studied the interplay between substrate stiﬀness and pro - inﬂammatory agonists in inducing lung inﬂamma - tion and found that LPS - activated inﬂammatory response on EC is augmented on stiﬀer ( 40 kPa ) compared to softer ( 1 . 5 kPa ) polyacrylamide hydrogels . 59 LPS - induced inﬂam - mation was accompanied by the increased expression of ECM proteins ﬁbronectin and collagen I , enhanced expres - sion and activity of lysyl oxidase , increased production of IL - 8 , and augmented expression of ICAM - 1 and VCAM - 1 . A strong association between the matrix stiﬀness and inﬂammation is considered a major contributing factor to the progression of ﬁbrosis . During ﬁbrosis , excessive accu - mulation of ECM further enhances matrix stiﬀening that Fig . 3 . Stiffness - induced EC permeability and inflammation in ALI . Extracellular matrix ( ECM ) stiffening leads to leukocyte transen - dothelial migration via integrin signaling and ICAM - 1 clustering in endothelial cells ( EC ) . The activation of Rho and Rho - associated kinase ( ROCK ) increase myosin light chain ( MLC ) phosphorylation inducing actomyosin contractility and ultimately causing increased permeability and inflammation which are two major hallmarks of acute lung injury ( ALI ) . 4 | Role of stiffness in ALI and PH Karki and Birukova escalates the inﬂammatory response which stimulates ﬁbro - blasts to secret more ECM , aiding to the exacerbation of ﬁbrosis . 6 , 60 , 61 The role of matrix stiﬀness in ﬁbrosis was fur - ther revealed in a recent study where the loss of Fibulin - 5 , an elastin ﬁber component of ECM , decreased tissue stiﬀ - ness , inﬂammatory response , and abolished ﬁbrotic pheno - type in a mouse of cutaneous ﬁbrosis . 62 Mechanism of stiffness - induced endothelial inflammation Rho - ROCK pathway also appears to play a key role in stiﬀness - induced regulation of inﬂammation . Given that inﬂammation involves the activation of Rho pathway , Rho - ROCK - actomyosin contractility is suggested to be the major mechanotransduction signaling axis employed by both EC and leukocytes during stiﬀness - induced leuko - cytes transmigration . 39 , 63 , 64 In fact , the increased transmi - gration of leukocytes with increasing matrix stiﬀness was signiﬁcantly decreased by the inhibition of Rho pathway . 4 Our study has shown that LPS - induced activation of guan - ine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF - H1 ) , a Rho activator , is dependent on stiﬀness . 59 EC grown on 40 kPa hydrogels had higher basal level of GEF - H1 expression and LPS - induced increase in GEF - H1 expression was attenuated by pharmacological or genetic inhibition of lysyl oxidase . An earlier study had allocated the role of GEF - H1 in mediating cellular stiﬀness in response to mechanical forces . 65 In regards to the relation between stiﬀness and inﬂammation , a recent study reported that matrix stiﬀening induces the activation of nuclear factor - kappa B ( NF - k B ) , a major path - way leading to the activation of several inﬂammatory genes , causing the disruption of endothelial barrier and increased susceptibility to proinﬂammatory agonists . 66 Role of other factors in ECM stiffness - induced pathologies There is a growing appreciation of the role of other factors which in association with matrix stiﬀness play a role in modulating the EC behavior in various pathological condi - tions . For example , ﬂuid shear stress enhances EC barrier integrity by downregulating RhoA activation in cells grown in softer matrices . 67 Likewise , matrix stiﬀness modulates the functional crosstalk between EC , epithelial cells , smooth muscle cells , and immune cells and may be an important factor contributing to severity of disease . 68 ECM composition changes also have a big impact in the development of various diseases . Since ECM is a dynamic structure that constantly undergoes remodeling to control tissue homeostasis , any change in the composition of ECM proteins may play a crucial role in the vascular pathophysi - ology of various organs including the lung . 69 As an example , acute exposure of endothelial cells to shear stress stimulates NF - k B through a pathway involving activation of integrin a v (cid:2) 3 . 70 However , shear stress - induced activation of NF - k B and increased expression of the proinﬂammatory proteins ICAM - 1 and VCAM - 1 occur on ﬁbronectin ( FN ) or ﬁbrino - gen ( FG ) matrix , but not in cells plated on collagen ( Coll ) or laminin . 71 Such contrasting eﬀects are explained by diﬀerent types of integrins interacting with FN / FG and Coll / laminin substrates and bearing distinct sets of integrin - associated signaling molecules . The other important factor aﬀecting endothelial responses in pathologic conditions that needs special con - sideration is ECM proteins post - translational modiﬁcations including enzymatic and chemical crosslinking , glycation and glycosylation , oxidation , and enzymatic degradation . These factors also signiﬁcantly aﬀect overall ECM biomech - anics . For instance , the ECM glycation or reactive oxygen species - induced ECM oxidation leads to ECM stiﬀening , altered mechanical microenvironment of vascular EC , and has been linked to ﬁbrosis . 72 Implications of stiffness - induced vascular permeability and inflammation in ALI and PH Acute lung injury The increased endothelial permeability and inﬂammation are two major hallmarks of many pulmonary disorders including ALI , ARDS , and edema . An extensive study in the recent years have established that most of the barrier disruptive agonists induce EC hyperpermeability and acti - vate inﬂammatory signaling cascades that ultimately leads to vascular leak , lung injury , and inﬂammation . 2 , 73 As dis - cussed above , matrix stiﬀness is directly associated with the onset of both endothelial permeability and inﬂammation , suggesting that ECM mechanics might play a key role in the pathogenesis of ALI ( Fig . 4 ) . With the consistent ﬁnd - ings from AFM studies and EC culture on hydrogels of varying degree of stiﬀness , it is now widely accepted that mechanodynamics of ECM composition play a pivotal role in regulating endothelial barrier integrity , with increased stiﬀness acting as a trigger for endothelial perme - ability and inﬂammation . Some in vivo studies have further bolstered this evidence demonstrating that agonists - induced vascular leak and inﬂammation is accompanied by stiﬀer lung phenotype mediated by the change in ECM . 32 , 55 The adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes , a key event in initiation of inﬂammation , is also determined by endothelial and ECM stiﬀness , indicating an important interplay between ECM and inﬂammation that might play a pivotal role in the etiology of ALI . The activation of Rho signaling functions as a common central pathway to mediate the eﬀects of barrier disruptive and inﬂammatory agonists during the induction of ALI . 74 – 76 The concurrent ﬁndings that matrix stiﬀness also leads to the activation of Rho and inhibition of Rho - ROCK pathway protects stiﬀness induced EC dysfunction suggest that stiﬀness likely exacerbates eﬀects of various agonists , bacterial pathogens , and endo - toxins which trigger ALI . Pulmonary Circulation Volume 8 Number 2 | 5 Pulmonary hypertension Increased vascular stiﬀness has been recognized as a major risk factor for cardiovascular disorders including PH . Speciﬁcally , higher levels of pulmonary arterial stiﬀness are suggested to precede development of clinical picture of PH . 77 , 78 The reactive phase of hypertension indicated by an increased smooth muscle contractility during pathogenesis of PH is followed by an organic phase , i . e . morphological and structural changes in the vessel wall with increased thickness of smooth muscle layer and strengthening the ECM . At the macroscale , these changes increase the stiﬀness of the vessel as anatomical structure leading to decrease in arterial compliance and increased pulse wave velocity . The decrease in the compliance of pulmonary arteries due to the increased collagen deposition is considered as a predictor of increased mortality rate in PH patients . 79 The decreased arterial compliance leads to an increase in pulse wave vel - ocity which is also regarded as an important contributor to PH . 78 Since the changes in arterial stiﬀness followed by altered pulse wave velocity are two established major causes of PH , the eﬀorts have been directed to develop new tools to measure these parameters to have a better prog - nosis and diagnosis of PH . Although the precise role of pulmonary artery stiﬀening in PH remains to be elucidated , some studies have shown that it increases ﬂow pulsatility in the pulmonary vasculature that can contribute to endothe - lial dysfunction and inﬂammation . 80 – 82 In line with this , stiﬀening - induced high pulsatility ﬂow induces inﬂammation in pulmonary artery EC by the activation of TLR2 / NF - k B pathway . 83 The cellular and molecular mechanisms behind this eﬀect are not clear , but the increased pulsatility caused by stiﬀening of large pulmonary artery increases ﬂow shear stress and EC might sense and respond to these mechanical forces by activating inﬂammatory signaling pathways ( Fig . 4 ) . In fact , the high pulsatility ﬂow induces the proin - ﬂammatory responses in the vascular endothelium and causes EC dysfunction by promoting endothelial to mesen - chymal transition . 84 Based on these ﬁndings , it was sug - gested that there might be sequential molecular events that dictate high pulsatility force - induced PH hypertrophy , inﬂammation , endothelial phenotype transition , and ﬁbro - sis . 84 Conversely , mechanical stretch in combination with inﬂammation induced aortic stiﬀening in hypertension by promoting collagen deposition . 85 Thus , direct role of vascu - lar stiﬀness - induced endothelial permeability as in athero - sclerosis is not well - known in PH and future studies are required to address it . Nevertheless , the beneﬁcial eﬀects of Rho kinase inhibitor fasudil , which improves endothelial function in both atherosclerosis and PH , hints that both diseases might involve the common feature of vascular stiﬀ - ness - induced EC dysfunction by Rho activation . 86 – 88 Fig . 4 . Mechanism of stiffness - induced ALI and PH . During ALI , pathogens or their virulent components induce inflammatory response by facilitating the leukocyte extravasation and may also simultaneously increase endothelial permeability by the activation of GEF - H1 / Rho signaling pathway . The increased ECM proteins and adhesion molecules synthesis is mediated by NFkB pathway which acts as a feedback mechanism to increase stiffness . In pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) , the causes yet to be known induce pulmonary artery stiffening with increased flow pulsatility which possibly initiates inflammation and EC dysfunction . 6 | Role of stiffness in ALI and PH Karki and Birukova Summary Vascular stiﬀening and decreased lung compliance are common features of aging and are implicated as risk factors for multiple cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases includ - ing ALI and PH . The role of mechanodynamic changes in ECM and subsequent EC barrier dysfunction by increased endothelial permeability and inﬂammation has now been well appreciated . The studies have established that Rho - mediated actomyosin contractility and cytoskeletal remodeling plays a critical role in mediating stiﬀness - induced vascular leak and inﬂammation . The inhibition of Rho signaling pathway could be a potential therapeutic for matrix stiﬀness - caused diseases as augmented by the fact that Rho inhibitors provided promising beneﬁcial eﬀects in preclinical trials against multiple cardiovascular disorders including PH . Furthermore , the future studies employing the advanced cell culture systems including 3D and organotypic tissue culture would closely mimic the in vivo microenviron - ment and help to better explore the role of substrate stiﬀness in the pathophysiology of ALI , PH , and other diseases . 2017 Grover Conference Series This review article is part of the 2017 Grover Conference Series .
