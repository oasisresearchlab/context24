ORIGINAL RESEARCH Confocal Microscopy Study of Arabidopsis Embryogenesis Using GFP : mTn Sung Soo Whang Received : 25 February 2009 / Revised : 22 April 2009 / Accepted : 29 April 2009 / Published online : 27 May 2009 # The Botanical Society of Korea 2009 Abstract Embryogenesis in transgenic Arabidopsis plants with GFP : mTn , a chimeric fusion of soluble shifted green fluorescent protein and a mouse actin binding domain , was studied . Confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to determine patterns of formation and cellular responses during asymmetric cell division . Before such cells divide , the nucleus moves to the position where new cell walls are to be formed . The apical – basal axis of the embryo develops mainly at the zygote to octant stage , and these events are associated with asymmetric divisions of the zygote and hypophyseal cells . Formation of the radial axis is estab - lished from the dermatogen to the globular - stage embryo via tangential cell division within the upper tiers . Bilateral symmetry of the embryo primarily happens at the triangular stage through zig - zag cell divisions of initials of the cotyledonary primordia . All stages of embryogenesis are described in detail here . Keywords Arabidopsis . Asymmetric cell divisions . Cellular responses . Embryogenesis . GFP : mTn . Pattern formation During plant embryogenesis , the zygote transforms and begins to function as an embryo . Undifferentiated cells initially lack the features found in mature plants . However , positional and genetic information during the embryogenic process determine the apical – basal axis and the radial pattern of the pre - embryo , which comprises hundreds of cells ( Laux and Jürgens 1997 ; Jürgens 2001 ; Nawy et al . 2008 ) . Critical steps in early embryogenesis entail asymmetric or symmetric cell divisions with mutual coordinated growth . Although such divisions occur in accordance with positional and genetic information at certain stages of embryogenesis ( Mayer et al . 1993 ; Berleth and Jürgens 1993 ; Torres - Ruiz and Jürgens 1994 ; Scheres et al . 1995 ; Di Laurenzio et al . 1996 ; Lotan et al . 1998 ; Willemsen et al . 1998 ; Berleth and Chatfield 2002 ) , little is known about the specific cellular responses within these cells . Plant embryogenesis is defined by three phases — early , medial , and late . In the early phase , patterns form while an apical – basal axis and tissue systems begin to develop . During the medial phase , maturation of both axes and tissues is accompanied by the storage and accumulation of various compounds . Embryos in the late phase enter into arrested development in preparation for long - term dorman - cy . Embryogenesis of Arabidopsis proceeds relatively faster than those of other plants , with the early and medial phases coming within 12 days after pollination and the late phase beginning at day 14 , leading to a dried seed ( Lyndon 1990 ) . These three main phases can be subdivided into 20 stages , from zygote to mature dried embryo ; such categories are utilized in genetics and molecular biology research ( Jürgens and Mayer 1994 ; Laux et al . 2004 ) . Depending on the available genetic or positional information , two types of asymmetric cell division occur during embryogenesis ( Liu et al . 1993 ; Yadegari et al . 1994 ; Hardtke and Berleth 1998 ; Willemsen et al . 1998 ; Ogas et al . 1999 ; Steinmann et al . 1999 ; Bowman and Eshed 2000 ; Helariutta et al . 2000 ; Wysocka - Diller et al . 2000 ; Nakajima et al . 2001 ; Takada et al . 2001 ; Berleth and Chatfield 2002 ; Casson and Lindsey 2006 ; Kim 2007 ; Spencer et al . 2007 ) . These events eventually give rise to the formation of external morphologies , e . g . , cotyledons , radicle , and hypocotyl , as well as a variety of internal J . Plant Biol .

The first division of the zygote must be asymmetric and under genetic control , producing a smaller apical cell and a large basal cell ( Jürgens and Mayer 1994 ; Colette and Heidstra 2007 ) . Later , the apical cell will be responsible for aboveground activities , while the basal cells will control those of the belowground plant portions . Lens - shaped cells , which appear via asymmetric division and under genetic control , are found in the 33rd cell stage of the globular embryo , as part of the underground organs ( Laux et al . 2004 ) . In contrast , positional information controls both asymmetric cell division , such as that of the inner cells during the 17th cell phase at the dermatogen stage , and also the elongated central cells that form the vascular procam - bium during the 65th cell phase at the mid - globular stage . Research on the patterns of embryogenesis has focused on several plant mutants . Although the first division usually sets up the apical – basal axis of the embryo , mutated genes confer a loss of polarity and result in an undeveloped embryo . The radial tissue pattern is established during the globular stage by genes that are responsible for cell identity ( Mayer et al . 1993 ; Przemeck et al . 1996 ; Vroemen et al . 1996 ; Hardtke and Berleth 1998 ; Long et al . 2006 ) . Genes that affect the early steps in embryonic cell division include AtML1 , SCR , SHR , ZLL , STM , ANT , AS1 , FIL , REV , and YAB3 ( Jürgens 2001 , 1993 ) . Mutations such as GNOM , AtLTP1 , PIN1 , and MP adversely influence the formation of the epi - and hypocotyl . Their expression can also prevent normal embryo development under extreme conditions ( Hardtke and Berleth 1998 ) . The observational method of embryogenesis has mainly been utilized with permanent preparation slides that display special characteristics at each developmental stage , as well as various aspects of cell division and pattern formation in mutant tissues ( Steeves and Sussex 1989 ; Goldberg et al . 1994 ; Brownlee and Berger 1995 ; Laux and Jürgens 1997 ; Berleth and Chatfield 2002 ; Casson et al . 2005 ) . Now , researchers have introduced green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) as a reporter gene for conducting developmental studies ( Davis and Vierstra 1998 ) . Here , the objective was to investigate the features of cell division during Arabidopsis embryogenesis . Trans - genic plants containing a chimeric gene between GFP and talin , an actin binding domain , were generated , and confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed with living embryos . Materials and Methods Plant Materials and Growing Conditions “ Columbia - O ” , a wild - type Arabidopsis , was obtained from The Arabidopsis Information Resource . After imbibition at 4°C for 5 days , seeds were germinated in pots containing a 1 : 1 : 1 mixture of top soil / perlite / vermiculite , plus approx . 1 g of 14 - 14 - 14 Osmocote ( Song and Clark 2005 ) . Plants were grown at 24°C under approx . 800 foot - candles of constant cool - white fluorescent light . DNA Construct , PCR , and Transformation GFP , modified according to the method of Haseloff et al . ( 1997 ) , was used as a reporter protein . A chimeric fusion , GFP : mTn , was made between this green fluorescence protein and a mouse talin f - actin binding domain . The stop codon at the 3 ′ end of the GFP sequence was replaced with an oligonucleotide encoding a 5× Gly Ala linker followed by a multiple cloning site ( MCS ) . The mTn binding sequence was PCR - amplified from pGST - Tn2345 ∼ 2541 ( McCann and Craig 1997 ; Kost et al . 1998 ) using primers FmTn ( 5 ′ - GGATCCATCCTAGAAGCTGCCAAGTC - 3 ′ ) and RmTn ( 5 ′ - TCTAGATTAGTGCTCGTCTCGAAGCT - 3 ′ ) . These were inserted in - frame with GFP into the MCS of pSTblue - 1 ( Novagen ) . PCR was performed with an initial 1 min of denaturation at 94°C , followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 94°C , 30 s at 56°C , and 1 min at 72°C . The vector construct was introduced into Escherichia coli DH ∂ 5 and Agrobacterium tumefaciens AGL1 strain by the freeze – thaw method ( An et al . 1988 ) . For Agrobacterium - mediated transformation of Arabidopsis thaliana , a GFP : mTn expres - sion cassette was cloned into binary vector pCB302 - 3 ( Xiang et al . 1999 ) with Ham H1 and Xba 1 ( Fig . 1 ) . Arabidopsis plants were transformed via floral dipping ( Clough and Bent 1998 ) . T 1 and T 2 transgenics were first screened for BASTA resistance before strong signals for GFP in the seedlings were detected under a fluorescence stereo - microscope ( SMZ1000 , Type 108 ; Nikon , Japan ) . Confocal Microscopy Siliques of T 3 transgenic plants were prepared with forceps and dissecting knives under a stereo - microscope . Embryos at serial stages of development were selected and mounted on hol - slide glasses with distilled water . They were then covered and sealed with transparent glue . Slide samples were examined with a 100× oil immersion lens under a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning microscope ( Carl Zeiss , Germany ) . GFP fluorescence was imaged using excitation with the 488 - nm line of an argon laser and a 505 ∼ 530 nm band - pass emission filter . Results and Discussion Vector DNA containing the GFP : mTn expression cassette was 4 . 4 kb long ( Fig . 1 ) . This cassette comprised 716 bp of J . Plant Biol . ( 2009 ) 52 : 312 – 318 313 GFP and 588 bp of mTn . Embryogenesis was examined in T 3 plants transformed with GFP : mTn and lacking specific phenotypes . The fifth to seventh silique from the top of the inflorescence served as the control point for dissection to obtain globular - stage embryos , with the upper ones being younger than those from the lower siliques . Cell divisions in the zygote after fertilization showed nearly similar patterns in time and space during morphogenesis , activation of the primary meristem , cell differentiation , and preparation of the embryo for dormancy ( Jürgens 2001 ) . Defining features included formation of the apical – basal and radial axes and bilateral symmetry of the seedling through symmetric and asym - metric divisions . Zygote to Octant - Stage Embryo : Formation of the Apical – Basal Axis Within a few hours post - fertilization , the zygote elongates about three - fold along the chalaza - micropyle axis of the ovule ( Mansfield and Briaty 1991 ) . It then undergoes perpendicular cell division to the axis , giving rise to apical – basal polarity . This is manifested by a smaller apical cell that is elliptically swollen and a larger , rod - shaped basal cell ( Fig . 2a ) . That is the first asymmetric cell division controlled by genetic information after fertilization ( Mayer et al . 1993 ; Friml et al . 2003 ; Vernon and Meinke 1994 ) . The upper cell will generate the entire embryo , with two exceptions : its very basal end and the lower hypophysis , which will produce the embryo radicle and the suspensor that provides nutrients ( Yeung and Sussex 1979 ; Jürgens and Mayer 1994 ) . Two cellular responses occur during zygote expansion , i . e . , the cyto - plasm and the nucleus are re - located toward the apical end ( Mòl et al . 1994 ; see the basal cell in Fig . 2a ) . Directional expansion of the zygote may be related to the orientation of the apical – basal axis of the ovule and associated with a reorganization of the microtubular cytoskeleton ( Webb and Gunning 1991 ) . This initial round of apical cell division is characterized by the first longitudinal division , resulting in two half - moon - shaped daughter cells ( Fig . 2b ) . The second round is the same , producing a quadrant - stage embryo and giving rise to a quarter - shaped cell that resembles a Rugby ball ( Fig . 2c ) . The third round leads to partitioning into eight pro - embryo cells that will undergo the first periclinal cell divisions ( Fig . 2d ) . This octant - stage embryo develops into an upper and a lower tier . The former will establish an apical domain that comprises the shoot apical meristem and most of the cotyledon , whereas the latter will contain the central domain hypocotyl , vascular primordia , and root and proximal initials of the root meristem . Dermatogen to Globular - Stage Embryo : Formation of the Radial Axis The first radial patterning event occurs at the dermato - gen stage ( Fig . 3a ) and within a relatively short time . This stage consists of 16 cells that have resulted from a single round of tangential division from the octant - stage embryo ( Jürgens and Mayer 1994 ; Berleth and Chatfield 2002 ) . Such a division is characterized by the separation of eight inner cells plus an outer layer of eight epidermal precursor cells called the protoderm ( Fig . 3a ) . This is the first asymmetric cell division ruled by positional information ( Mansfield and Briaty 1991 ) . Meanwhile , the uppermost derivative of the basal daughter cell undergoes asymmetric cell division controlled by intrinsic factors ( Haecker et al . 2004 ) . The daughter cell adjacent to the embryonic cell mass originates a lens - shaped cell ( Fig . 3a ) that will eventually cover the quiescent center and the initials of the central root cap . This early globular - stage features another round of division from the dermatogen stage , resulting in 33 cells ( Fig . 3b ) . The vascular primordia split into a central vasculature and a surrounding layer of pericycle cells . This stage is characterized by the first appearance of primordia for vascular tissue in the central part of the lower tier . These vascular primordia are rod - shaped due to expansion along the apical – basal axis , and their nuclei are polarized to the top of the end wall ( Fig . 3b ) .

( 2009 ) 52 : 312 – 318 315 globular - stage embryo , with 65 cells , shows transverse and asymmetric cell division of the inner cells derived from the lower tier , making that division appear much smaller ( Fig . 3c ) . This step is controlled by extrinsic factors ( Scheres et al . 1994 ; Haecker et al . 2004 ) . Interestingly , the inner cells derived from the upper tier do not undergo any transverse cell division at this stage . The radial axis is completed at the late globular stage by both perpendicular and transverse divisions throughout the tiered inner cells ( Fig . 3d ) . Triangular to Mature Embryo Stage : Formation of Bilateral Symmetry The triangular stage is characterized by the development of cotyledon initials from zig - zag cell divisions in the upper tier ( Fig . 4a ) . Upon reaching 150 ∼ 250 cells , the apical surfaces of the embryo are now flattened , with their overall shape gradually becoming triangular in laterally flattened views , thereby forming a bilateral symmetry .

Plant Biol . ( 2009 ) 52 : 312 – 318 structures — cotyledonary primordia , initials for shoot and root meristems , and the hypocotyl ( Fig . 4b ) . This stage eventually numbers 500 cells ( Jürgens and Mayer 1994 ) . The late heart stage first shows initials for both the lateral root cap and the root epidermis due to periclinal divisions of the epidermal cells in the nearby hypophysis ( Fig . 4c ) . Cotyledonary primordia in the early torpedo stage grow rapidly and are in parallel at the distal parts ( Fig . 4d ) . The late torpedo stage is characterized by round to oval cotyledonary primordia ( Fig . 5a ) , and the embryo is now up to 300 μ m long and 100 μ m wide . The mature embryo stage marks the end of embryogenesis and presents structures for an eventual seedling . Its overall length is 800 μ m , with 15 , 000 ∼ 20 , 000 cells ( Fig . 5b ; Jürgens and Mayer 1994 ) . The cotyledonary primordia are folded back to the root cap and have developed vasculature . Cellular Responses During Asymmetric Cell Division Asymmetric cell divisions play an important role in morphogenesis during embryo formation and are controlled by genetic or positional information ( Laux et al . 2004 ; Colette and Heidstra 2007 ) . The goal of this study was to determine the cellular responses of asymmetric divisions by using GFP : mTn visualization . Before such division occurs , the nucleus is shifted to a position where new cell walls will be formed , a process that is directed by both intrinsic factors ( Fig . 3a ) and positional information ( Fig 3b ) . Although the nucleus of the basal cell is still sited in the center at the beginning of that stage ( Fig . 2d ) , it then re - locates to the top of the cell ( Fig . 3a ) . That event of asymmetric division gives rise to lens - shaped cells ( Fig . 3b ) . In addition , the nuclei of vascular primordial cells clearly expand in the upper part of the cells ( Fig . 3b ) , which then undergo asymmetric cell division to produce smaller apical and larger basal cells ( Fig . 3c ) .
