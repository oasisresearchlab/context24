Chintakuntlawar , Jeong Yoon Lee , Mirja Ramke , James Chodosh , Jaya Rajaiya * Department of Ophthalmology , Harvard Medical School , Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary , Boston , Massachusetts , United States of America Abstract The cellular entry of viruses represents a critical area of study , not only for viral tropism , but also because viral entry dictates the nature of the immune response elicited upon infection . Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis ( EKC ) , caused by viruses within human adenovirus species D ( HAdV - D ) , is a severe , ocular surface infection associated with corneal inflammation . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis has previously been shown to play a critical role in entry of other HAdV species into many host cell types . However , HAdV - D endocytosis into corneal cells has not been extensively studied . Herein , we show an essential role for cholesterol rich , lipid raft microdomains and caveolin - 1 , in the entry of HAdV - D37 into primary human corneal fibroblasts . Cholesterol depletion using methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( MβCD ) profoundly reduced viral infection . When replenished with soluble cholesterol , the effect of MβCD was reversed , allowing productive viral infection . HAdV - D37 DNA was identified in caveolin - 1 rich endosomal fractions after infection . Src kinase activity was also increased in caveolin - 1 rich endosomal fractions after infection , and Src phosphorylation and CXCL1 induction were both decreased in caveolin - 1 - / - mice corneas compared to wild type mice . siRNA knock down of caveolin - 1 in corneal cells reduced chemokine induction upon viral infection , and caveolin - 1 - / - mouse corneas showed reduced cellular entry of HAdV - D37 . As a control , HAdV - C2 , a non - corneal pathogen , appeared to utilize the caveolar pathway for entry into A549 cells , but failed to infect corneal cells entirely , indicating virus and cell specific tropism . Immuno - electron microscopy confirmed the presence of caveolin - 1 in HAdV - D37 - containing vesicles during the earliest stages of viral entry . Collectively , these experiments indicate for the first time that HAdV - D37 uses a lipid raft mediated caveolin - 1 associated pathway for entry into corneal cells , and connects the processes of viral entry with downstream proinflammatory cell signaling .

Introduction Human adenoviruses ( HAdVs ) cause a broad range of infections at mucosal sites [ 1 ] . Additionally , HAdV vectors are widely used for the study of cellular processes , and are chosen as gene and vaccine delivery vehicles for clinical use . A shortcoming of HAdVs in therapy for human diseases is their intrinsic tendency , as with infection by naturally occurring HAdVs , to induce innate immune responses and inflammation [ 2 , 3 ] . One potential mechanism for HAdV induced inflammation can be found in the process of viral entry , in which cellular components involved in viral internalization directly induce subsequent inflammatory gene expression by infected cells [ 4 – 7 ] . Therefore , to understand basic mechanisms of HAdV induced inflammation , and to mitigate complications of adenoviral gene therapy , it is important to understand modes of HAdV entry into various cell types . Endocytosis is a multi - step process that involves internalization of macromolecules and particles into specific transport vesicles derived from a cell’s plasma membrane . Clathrin mediated endocytosis is a well studied endocytic pathway used by both enveloped and non - enveloped viruses [ 8 ] . The cell surface is abundantly endowed with other components that allow detection and response to external stimuli . Lipid rafts represent one of the major constituents of the cell membrane , contain a heterogeneous population of proteins , and act as centers for downstream cell signaling . Caveolae are a special type of lipid raft that by electron PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 1 October 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e77462 microscopy appear as uncoated , flask - shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane , and are responsible for uptake and efflux of cholesterol esters . Caveolar , lipid raft mediated endocytosis plays an important role in cell adhesion and growth [ 9 , 10 ] . Caveolins are the major integral membrane protein of caveolae [ 11 ] and include three types with a similar molecular weight of 22 kDa [ 12 , 13 ] . Caveolin - 1 and - 2 are found in most cell types , while caveolin - 3 is present only in muscle cells . Knockout of the gene for caveolin - 1 in mice also reduces caveolin - 2 expression , and leads to loss of morphologically defined caveolae [ 14 ] . Caveolae - like structures were identified as possible pathways of viral entry for SV40 in 1989 [ 15 ] , however , SV40 entry via caveolae was recently disputed [ 16 ] . In addition to SV40 , caveolae and lipid rafts have been implicated in the entry of filovirus [ 17 ] , human enterovirus [ 18 ] , echovirus [ 19 ] and human immunodeficiency virus [ 20 , 21 ] , among others [ 22 – 26 ] . Importantly , the specific means of host cell entry by viruses appears to be dependent on the type of cell and its state of activation , and may be redundant [ 27 , 28 ] . Signaling molecules are an integral part of the host immune response to viral infection , and recent studies have shown a role for cell signaling in viral entry [ 29 – 32 ] and viral replication [ 33 ] . For adenoviruses , viral attachment to specific integrins activates PI3K which in turn activates the small GTPases , Rac and Cdc42 [ 34 ] . Inhibition of cell signaling can drastically reduce virus infection [ 35 , 36 ] . SV40 entry is regulated by at least five different kinases [ 37 ] . Virus attachment to cells can induce lipid raft formation by clustering of specific surface proteins and lipids . Interestingly , many viruses bind glycophosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) - anchored proteins and gangliosides , associated with the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane , and this may lead directly to activation of cellular kinases [ 30 ] , adding to increasing evidence that virus binding to lipid rafts specifically initiates intracellular signaling . For the entry of adenoviruses , existing evidence suggests entry begins with a requisite binding of the adenovirus capsid fiber knob to a cellular receptor such as the coxsackie adenovirus receptor ( CAR ) [ 38 ] , CD46 [ 39 , 40 ] , or in particular for viruses causing epidemic keratoconjunctivitis , GD1a glycan [ 41 ] . Initial binding is followed by a secondary interaction between the arginine - glycine - aspartic acid ( RGD ) motif in the viral capsid penton base and cellular integrins α v β 3 , α v β 5 , and α V β 1 [ 42 – 45 ] This secondary interaction is thought to induce a host cell signaling cascade resulting in clathrin mediated endocytosis [ 46 – 48 ] , and possibly , activation of the rab5 dependent classical endosomal pathway [ 49 ] . Herein , we show that HAdV - D37 , an etiologic agent of epidemic keratoconjunctivitis , enters primary human corneal fibroblasts predominantly via lipid rafts and caveolae , suggesting both redundancy and cell specificity in mechanisms of adenoviral entry . Results Cell and virus specific infection To test whether viral entry is cell and / or virus specific as previously shown for HAdV - C [ 50 ] , we directly compared pathways of infection in human corneal fibroblasts and A549 cells using HAdV - D37 and HAdV - C2 . Individual confocal image slices were loaded to measure co - localization pixels ( Amira 5 . 2 . 2 ) in cells ( green : caveolin - 1 or LAMP1 , a late endosomal marker associated with conventional endosomes [ 51 ] , red : Cy3 - labeled HAdV - D37 ) . In human corneal cells , Cy3 - labeled HAdV - D37 co - localized to a greater degree with caveolin - 1 than with LAMP1 ( p = . 0068 ) , while in A549 cells HAdV - 37 predominantly co - localized with LAMP1 ( p = . 0025 ) , indicating an entry pathway other than caveolae ( Figures 1A and B ) . HAdV - C2 , not known to infect the cornea , failed to infect corneal cells in culture , and in A549 cells co - localized predominantly with caveolin - 1 ( p = . 02 ) . ( Figures 1A and B ) . Cholera toxin B subunit ( CTXB ) has been used to track and identify lipid rafts . To further examine the role of lipid raft microdomains in HAdV - D37 entry , we treated corneal cells with both Cy3 - labeled virus and 488 - CTXB , and tracked their cellular localization over time ( Figure 1C ) . Co - localization of virus and CTXB was observed in the cell membrane at 30 min , cytoplasm at 60 min , and perinuclear region at 90 min , supporting a role for caveolin - 1 and lipid rafts in HAdV - D37 entry into corneal cells . Cholesterol Dependent HAdV - D37 Cell Entry In order to directly determine a role for cholesterol - laden lipid rafts in HAdV - D37 entry , primary corneal cells were pretreated with MβCD ( 5 mM ) to deplete cholesterol prior to infection with Cy3 - labeled HAdV - D37 . Earlier studies showed an essential role for both integrins and Src kinase in HAdV entry [ 31 , 35 , 45 , 46 , 52 ] . Therefore , control pretreatments also included an RGD - containing 15 - mer ( 50 μM ) designed to match the amino acid sequence in the HAdV - D37 penton base ( DAVP ( RGD ) NYASAAEA ) [ 53 , 54 ] , in order to block integrin aggregation , and its KGE - containing 15 - mer control ( DAVP ( KGE ) NYASAAEA ) , otherwise identical to the RGD 15 - mer . The chemical PP2 ( 10 μM ) was used to inhibit Src kinase activity . At both 30 min and 1 hr post infection , viral entry appeared nearly completely blocked by pretreatment with either MβCD or RGD , and partially by PP2 , but not by KGE ( Figure 2A ) . Replenishment of cholesterol ( 0 . 4mg / ml in 0 . 2mM MβCD ) for 1 hr appeared to restore both normal cell morphology and viral entry , as assessed by confocal microscopy ( Figure 2B ) . Western blot analysis of detergent free lipid raft preparations at 1 hr post infection revealed increased caveolin - 1 in lipid rafts from virus infected cells as judged collectively in fractions 4 , 5 and 6 ( Figure 2C ) . Caveolin - 1 was seen at much lower levels and only in the 5 th fraction of mock infected cells . In cells that were MβCD treated prior to virus infection , caveolin - 1 was reduced . We also observed increased phospho - Src ( pSrc ) in virus infected cell fractions 5 and 6 . Reductions in both caveolin - 1 and pSrc were observed in RGD pretreated cells , whereas PP2 pretreatment reduced only pSrc and not caveolin - 1 ( Figure 2C ) . These results suggest a relationship between caveolin - 1 and Src in HAdV - D37 entry . HAdV - D37 enters corneal cells via caveosomes Our results indicate that cholesterol depletion in corneal cells presents an impediment to entry of HAdV - D37 past the cell membrane .

Upon viral infection , fractions 4 - 6 maximally expressed LAMP1 indicating the presence of late endosomes [ 56 ] , while fractions 9 - 11 were enriched with caveolin - 1 , indicating the presence of caveolae ( Figure 3A ) . When the blots were stripped and reprobed , the caveolin - 1 containing fractions were found to also contain pSrc . RAB5 , a marker for early endosomes [ 57 ] was observed in fractions 14 - 16 upon viral infection , but was not evident in the fractions expressing pSrc . We confirmed Src activation in fractions 10 and 11 using a Src kinase assay in which substrate fluorescence and kinase activity are inversely proportional ( Figure 3B ) . These results suggest that a pathway mediated by caveolin - 1 , and involving Src kinase , is an important route of HAdV entry into human corneal cells . MβCD pretreatment altered the fractionation of caveolin - 1 , and resulted in reduced identification of endosomal markers ( Figure 3A ) . However , we cannot exclude alternative possible effects of MβCD on clathrin mediated mechanisms , as previously shown [ 58 , 59 ] . Real - time PCR was then performed to amplify HAdV - D37 genomic E1A nucleotide sequence [ 54 ] in order to determine the presence of viral DNA in different endosomal fractions . Upon infection of corneal cells , significantly more viral DNA was present in the fraction 10 , containing caveolin - 1and pSrc , than in fraction 6 , which was abundant in LAMP1 ( Figure 3C ) Figure 3 . HAdV - D37 uses primarily caveolin - 1 to enter corneal cells . A . Endosomal purification was performed on postnuclear extracts from corneal cells at 1 hr post infection in 62 % , 35 % and 25 % sucrose solution . Fractions were immunoblotted for caveolin - 1 ( Cav 1 ) , pSrc , RAB5 , and LAMP1 . B . Src kinase assay was performed on endosomal fraction # ’s 5 - 11 . In this assay , fluorescence is inversely proportional to kinase activity . As shown , fractions 10 and 11 , which previously showed increased caveolin - 1 , also demonstrated greater Src kinase activity . C . Fractions that had maximum expression of LAMP1 ( # 6 ) and caveolin - 1 ( # 10 ) were then subjected to real time PCR . For both fractions , the quantity of viral DNA was reduced by MβCD pretreatment ( * p < . 05 ) . Cholesterol replenishment resulted in restoration of E1A expression ( * p < . 05 ) . There was no difference in E1A expression between virus infected cells and those pretreated with MβCD but replenished with cholesterol and then virus infected . The data presented is representative of four experiments each run in duplicate . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0077462 . g003 HAdV Entry and Caveolin - 1 PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 5 October 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e77462 ( fraction 6 vs . fraction 10 in virus infected cells : p = . 0027 ) . MβCD pretreatment reduced viral DNA content in both endosomal fractions ( p < . 05 , both comparisons ) . Viruses can often circumvent artificial barriers to cell entry by use of alternate entry pathways [ 50 , 60 , 61 ] . However , in our study , MβCD pretreatment reduced the presence of viral DNA in both the caveolin - 1 containing fraction and in the LAMP1 containing fraction . We also examined for the presence of viral DNA in lipid raft fractions from MβCD treated cells when replenished with cholesterol , as compared to those treated with MβCD alone prior to viral infection . In lipid raft fractions from MβCD treated , cholesterol replenished cells , E1A content was equivalent to that from cells not treated with MβCD prior to infection ( Figure 3C ) . Caveolin - 1 and cholesterol are necessary for viral entry Caveolin - 1 is a critical protein to caveolae [ 62 ] , and upon reduction in caveolin - 1 expression , cells lose the ability to form caveolae . We prepared a siRNA oligo against caveolin - 1 that by real - time PCR reduced its expression in corneal cells to ~ 5 % of normal ( p = . 0002 , Figure 4A ) . Western blot analysis after siRNA transfection also showed reduction in caveolin - 1 protein as compared to untransfected or control siRNA ( Figure 4B ) . Specificity of the caveolin - 1 siRNA was validated by showing expression of unrelated protein kinase C was not reduced compared to control ( data not shown ) . However , HAdV - D37 infection of corneal cells after caveolin - 1 knock down by siRNA reduced IL - 8 expression by ~ 50 % ( p = . 0001 , Figure 4C ) . Using the mouse adenovirus keratitis model [ 5 , 63 , 64 ] , we then analyzed the role of caveolin - 1 in viral infection . Cy3 - labeled HAdV - D37 was injected into the corneal stroma of caveolin - 1 - / - mice on a C57BL / 6J background or wild type C57BL / 6J controls . By confocal microscopy performed at 30 min , 1 hr , and 24 hr post infection , viral entry , but not viral attachment , appeared markedly reduced in caveolin - 1 - / - as compared to wild type mice at these time points ( Figure 5A ) . Western blot analysis of wild type and caveolin - 1 - / - mice corneas after infection revealed increased pSrc in wild type corneas at 1 and 24 hr post infection , compared to caveolin - 1 - / - mice , suggesting that caveolin - 1 is necessary for Src activation after infection ( Fig , 5B ) . Similarly , upon viral infection , CXCL1 protein expression was reduced in caveolin - 1 - / - mice as compared to wild type mice ( p = . 0001 , Figure 5C ) . These results suggest that caveolin - 1 is important to viral entry , kinase activation , and subsequent chemokine expression . Src kinase has been previously shown critical to both HAdV - D37 entry [ 35 ] and inflammatory consequences of infection of human corneal cells [ 35 , 52 , 65 – 67 ] . Data presented above further suggest that Src may play an important role in lipid raft mediated HAdV entry into corneal cells . Therefore , we applied the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 ( 10 μM ) to the mouse adenovirus keratitis model . When injected 30 min prior to HAdV - D37 infection , PP2 reduced corneal inflammation as assessed by histology 4 days post infection ( Figure 5D ) and also reduced CXCL1 expression by ELISA at 16 hr post infection ( p < . 05 , Figure 5E ) , while the PP2 solvent DMSO alone did not reduce inflammation or CXCL1 expression . Taken together , these data suggest HAdV - D37 enters corneal cells at least in part via caveolae , in an integrin dependent and Src kinase mediated pathway . Ultrastructure of caveolin - associated viral entry Caveolae are submicroscopic , membrane associated vesicles found abundantly in some but not all mammalian cells . A Caveola has a characteristic flask or bulb - shaped appearance [ 68 – 70 ] , without the obvious coat of clathrin pits [ 71 ] . Initially , SV40 was reported to use the caveolar pathway to enter cells [ 15 , 72 ] , but was later observed to use a caveolae independent pathway [ 16 , 60 , 73 ] . Each caveolae contains approximately 140 - 150 caveolin - 1 molecules [ 74 ] . To confirm caveolin associated viral entry into corneal fibroblasts , we performed ultrastructural studies with and without viral infection ( Figure 6 ) . Electron micrographs of uninfected fibroblasts demonstrate abundant membrane associated vesicles , visible as flask shaped invaginations of the cell membrane ( Figure 6A ) . Within 1 hr after HAdV - D37 infection , viruses were seen in some of these Caveola - like structures ( Figure 6B - D ) . In some tissue sections , it appeared that caveolae were fusing to form caveolar vesicles ( caveosomes ) as reported earlier [ 75 ] . Viruses also accumulated in these presumed caveosomes ( Figure 6D ) . In order to confirm that the membrane associated vesicles seen ultrastructurally are indeed caveolae , we applied immuno - electron microscopy with primary antibodies against caveolin - 1 or clathrin , and secondary antibody bound to protein - A nanogold . Membrane - associated vesicles in human corneal fibroblasts labeled well with antibody against caveolin - 1 ( Figure 6E ) . Within 30 min after viral adsorption , many caveolin - 1 expressing vesicles were seen to contain virus ( Figure 6F ) . The size of the caveolin - 1 containing vesicles in corneal cells ranged from ~ 80 - 140nm in diameter ( data not shown ) . Therefore some vesicles appeared able to accommodate the ~ 90 nm diameter adenovirus . Notably , clathrin staining vesicles in the same cells were much less abundant and no clathrin staining vesicles were seen to contain virus ( data not shown ) . These results confirm that HAdV - D37 uptake into human corneal fibroblasts occurs in vesicles containing caveolin - 1 . Discussion Endocytosis is used by pathogens as a gateway to cellular entry . The specific pathway of entry seems to be host and pathogen specific [ 76 ] . The most well studied mechanism of receptor - mediated entry is clathrin - dependent endocytosis . Most previous reports suggest that HAdVs use clathrin mediated endocytosis for cellular entry [ 77 , 78 ] , with macropinocytosis as an alternate pathway [ 77 , 79 – 81 ] . Caveolae are ubiquitous on the surface of cells , particularly in fibroblasts [ 82 ] , and appear large enough to accommodate human adenoviruses [ 83 – 85 ] , which typically measure ~ 90 nm in diameter . Recently , HAdV - C was shown to utilize lipid raft mediated , caveolar endocytosis in non fibroblast cell lines [ 50 , 61 ] . Because of our longstanding interest in pathogenesis of HAdVs in the human cornea , we sought to test viral entry in primary human corneal fibroblasts . We used two cell types , HAdV Entry and Caveolin - 1 PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 6 October 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e77462 Figure 4 .

Our results clearly demonstrate caveolin - 1 associated entry into corneal cells by the highly cornea - tropic HAdV - D37 . In contrast , HAdV - D37 entry into A549 cells was less robust and appeared to predominantly involve the LAMP1 pathway . As an additional control , we also tested the entry of HAdV - C2 , a non corneal pathogen , but the degree of entry into human corneal cells was too low to permit quantitative analysis . Caveolae mediated entry of another non - enveloped DNA virus , SV40 , is controversial [ 16 , 60 , 73 ] , and in the absence of caveolin - 1 , SV40 still successfully enters cells [ 60 ] , suggesting redundant and alternative mechanisms . However , in corneal stromal cells , HAdV - D37 appears to rely largely on lipid raft mediated , caveolin - 1 associated endocytosis . Cholera toxin B subunit ( CTXB ) has been shown to bind glycosphingolipid ligand , GM1 , and has been used to identify distinct , lipid raft endocytic pathways [ 87 ] . In our study , CTXB co - localized with HAdV - D37 in corneal cells during entry . We show the presence of viral DNA predominantly in caveolin - 1 associated membrane fractions . It is important to acknowledge that clathrin - mediated endocytosis is also sensitive to acute depletion of cholesterol [ 58 , 88 ] and that raft recruitment has been shown to precede clathrin - dependent endocytosis for anthrax toxin , EGFR , and BCR , respectively [ 89 – 91 ] . In our study , cholesterol depletion also reduced viral DNA in LAMP1 rich fractions in corneal cells , indicating a similar redundancy in cholesterol function . When cholesterol was replenished in cells treated with MβCD , there Figure 5 . The role of caveolin - 1 and Src kinase in HAdV entry and inflammation . A . C57BL / 6J wild type ( WT ) and caveolin - 1 - / - mice ( on the C57BL / 6J background ) were injected intrastromally with Cy3 - labeled ( red ) HAdV - D37 ( 10 5 tissue culture infectious doses ) or buffer control , and the corneas harvested for confocal microscopy . Phalloidin ( green ) co - staining was used to better visualize the cells . Virus entry was apparent by 1 hr post infection in WT mice . In caveolin - 1 - / - mice , virus remained mostly membrane bound in the first hour post infection and internalization appeared reduced at 24 hr compared to WT mice . B . Western blot analysis of the cornea from mice infected with HAdV - D37 revealed increasing pSrc at 1 and 24 hr post infection , while expression was minimal in untouched ( uninfected ) corneas . Caveolin - 1 - / - mice did not show increased pSrc even after 24 hr infection . Actin controls are shown in the bottom panel . C . ELISA for CXCL1 chemokine performed on WT and caveolin - 1 - / - mice corneas at 24 hr post infection with HAdV - D37 . Infected caveolin - 1 - / - mice corneas showed approximately 60 % less CXCL1 expression as compared to infected wild type corneas ( * p = . 0001 ) .

We also previously showed the critical role of Src in HAdV infection [ 35 , 52 , 66 , 67 , 92 ] . The observation of increased Src kinase activity specifically in caveolin - 1 enriched fractions in infected cells strongly suggests a role for caveosomal signaling upon viral infection . At 1 hr post infection , PP2 , a chemical inhibitor of Src kinases , partially reduced viral entry , whereas both MβCD and RGD more completely blocked viral entry . Using a mouse keratitis model [ 63 ] , caveolin - 1 - / - mice showed reduced entry of virus as compared to wild type mice and showed reduced levels of both pSrc and CXCL1 expression complimenting our in vitro data . Taken together , these findings suggest a role for Src kinase in the caveosome during viral entry , with downstream effects on chemokine expression by infected cells . Viruses even within the same virus family can utilize different endocytic pathways , and there may be extensive cross talk between pathways . For example , within the polyomaviruses , JC virus enters cells via clathrin mediated endocytosis [ 93 ] and is later sorted into caveosomes [ 94 ] , while BK virus uses pH dependent caveolar endocytosis [ 95 ] . Other polyomaviruses enter cells using uncoated vesicles independently of both caveolin and clathrin [ 96 ] . These studies do not account for potential differences in cell types used to determine viral entry . Our ultrastructural studies confirm the association between HAdV - D37 with caveolin - 1 in corneal fibroblasts during viral entry , but not clathrin in the same cells . Our data also suggests that HAdV - D37 may utilize different entry pathways in different cell types . Time course studies with a panel of cell types relevant to corneal infection will be necessary to determine the range of entry mechanisms utilized by HAdV - D37 , and to better understand the infectious and inflammatory outcome of different entry pathways . HAdV - D37 replicates readily in human corneal fibroblasts [ 53 ] , and in our hands , knockdown of caveolin - 1 reduced chemokine expression , suggesting that caveolin contributes to both productive infection and corneal inflammation . However , our data may be relevant only to the earliest stages of infection , and does not address possible sorting of virus later in infection to different endosomal compartments . In summary , we have shown that HAdV - D37 enters corneal stromal cells via a caveolin - 1 associated , lipid raft specific pathway , inducing caveosomal signaling and expression of pro - inflammatory mediators . Lipid raft mediated endocytosis may prove a useful target for antiviral therapy in corneal infection . Experimental Methods Ethics Statement The animals involved in this study were procured , maintained , and used in accordance with the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act of 1966 , as amended and NIH 80 - 23 , Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals , National Research Council , and upon approval from the Animal Care Committee at the Mass . Eye and Ear Infirmary . The derivation of corneal cells from deceased human donors was approved by the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary Human Studies Committee , and conformed to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki ; written informed consent for the use of the corneas from the deceased donors or their families was deemed unnecessary by the Human Studies Committee , because the corneal tissues arrived without identifying data , and were tissues that were found by the eye banks to be unsuitable for corneal transplantation and would have been discarded if not used in research . Cells and virus Primary human corneal fibroblasts were derived from human donor corneas as previously described [ 97 ] . Cells from multiple deceased donors from multiple eye banks were pooled and the cell monolayers used at passage two or three . The A549 cells and HAdVs used in this study were purchased from American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC , Manassas , VA ) . Virus purification was performed by cesium chloride gradient . Cy3 - labeled virus was prepared as previously described [ 98 ] . Mice Eight to 12 - week - old wild type C57BL / 6J and caveolin - 1 - / - mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories ( Bar Harbor , ME ) . For experimental infection , female mice were anesthetized by intramuscular injection of ketamine ( 85 mg / kg ) and xylazine ( 14 mg / kg ) . Anesthetic drops ( 0 . 5 % proparacaine hydrochloride , Alcon , Fort Worth , TX ) were applied topically to the right cornea , followed by injection with 1 μl PP2 ( 10 μM ) , DMSO carrier , and then HAdV - 37 after 1 hour . One μl of virus ( 10 5 tissue culture infective dose ( TCID ) ) , or virus - free dialysis buffer was injected into the central corneal stroma with a glass micropipette needle fitted with a gas - powered microinjection system ( MDI , South Plainfield , NJ ) under an ophthalmic surgical microscope ( Carl Zeiss Meditec , Inc . , Thornwood , NY ) . At 4 days post infection , mice were euthanized using CO 2 inhalation prior to removal of corneas for histology . Confocal Microscopy Cells grown on slide chambers ( Nunc , Rochester , NY ) were treated with MβCD ( 5mM ; Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) , RGD 15 - mer ( 50mM , GenScript , Piscataway , NJ ) , KGE 15 - mer ( 50mM , GenScript , Piscataway , NJ ) or PP2 ( 10 μM , Calbiochem , La Jolla , CA ) for 1 hr , and then infected with Cy3 - labeled HAdV for 30 min and 1 hr . Cells were partially fixed in 0 . 05 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min , washed in PBS containing 2 % FBS , and permeabilized in solution containing 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 5 min . After 30 min blocking in 3 % FBS - PBS , the cells were incubated in 5 μg / ml of Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin ( Invitrogen , Eugenia , OR ) for 30 min at room temperature , washed three times in 1x PBS containing 2 % FBS . Cells were then fixed in 2 % paraformaldehyde , and mounted using Vectashield ( Vector labs , Burlingame , CA ) mounting medium containing DAPI . Images were taken in a Leica SP5 confocal microscope using a 63x glycerol immersion objective . Mouse corneas were harvested at various time points after HAdV - D37 injection and stained with Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin , ( Invitrogen ) , fixed , and mounted using Vectashield . For co - localization studies after infection , cells were fixed and stained with antibodies to caveolin - 1 , ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , CA ) LAMP1 , ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , or 488 - CTXB , ( Invitrogen , HAdV Entry and Caveolin - 1 PLOS ONE | www . plosone . org 10 October 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e77462 OR ) . Individual confocal image stacks were loaded to measure co - localization pixels by Amira 5 . 2 . 2 ( Amira , Burlington , MA ) from cells stained green ( caveolin - 1 or LAMP1 ) and red ( Cy3 - labeled HAdV - D37 ) . Three frames each from 3 separate experiments were chosen in masked fashion and , used to generate mean and standard deviation . Non - detergent isolation of lipid rafts Cells were treated with MβCD , washed thoroughly , and infected with purified HAdV at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 10 for 30 min or mock treated with dialysis buffer . After infection , LR fractions were isolated using detergent free methods . Briefly , cells were washed once in ice cold PBS , suspended in 500mM Na 2 CO 3 , and lysed by 20 strokes in a prechilled dounce homogenizer . Further disruption of cell membranes were achieved by passing the lysate through a 23 gauge needle 5 times , followed by 3 cycles of sonication for 15 s . The subsequent lysate was mixed with an equal volume of 90 % sucrose - MBS ( 25mM MES { 2 - ( N - morpholinoethanesulfonic acid ) plus 0 . 15M NaCl [ pH 6 . 5 ] ) , overlaid on an equivalent volume of 35 % sucrose - MBS - Na 2 CO 3 , and centrifuged for 16 - 18 hr at 4°C . 500μl fractions were collected and the protein concentrations measured . The lysates were immunoblotted with anti - pSrc ( Cell Signaling , Danvers , MA ) to identify phosphorylated Src in LR along with the LR marker caveolin - 1 . Endosome isolation Flotation gradient fractionation of post nuclear supernatants was performed with 62 % , ( 2 . 351M ) 35 % , ( 1 . 177M ) and 25 % , ( 0 . 806M ) sucrose gradients [ 55 ] and 100 μl fractions collected . One hr post HAdV infection after pretreatment with MβCD ( 5mM ) , untreated controls and mock infected cells were collected and post nuclear supernatants were prepared by using NucBuster ( Novagen , Germany ) . Post nuclear supernatants were then mixed with an equal amount of 62 % sucrose , layered over with 1 . 5 volume of 35 % sucrose and 1 volume of 25 % sucrose , and centrifuged for 1 hr at 149 , 000 x g at 4°C . A series of 100 μl fractions were collected from the surface and subjected to western blot analysis for caveolin - 1 , phosphorylated Src , RAB5 , and LAMP1 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , and real - time PCR for the HAdV - D37 E1A gene in order to determine the presence of viral DNA in the endosomes . siRNA construction and transfection The siRNA for caveolin - 1 and its control scrambled siRNA ( Table 1 ) were constructed using SciTools from Integrated DNA Technology ( IDT , Coralville , IA ) . One nm was transfected using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) following the manufacturer’s instructions . At 48 hr post transfection , cells were infected with HAdV for 2 hr , and then analyzed for caveolin - 1 and IL - 8 message using real - time RT - PCR ( Table 1 ) . For Western blot analysis , 20 μg of protein was separated in a 4 - 20 % gradient gel ( Invitrogen ) and immunoblotted with antibodies against caveolin - 1 and actin ( Thermo Scientific , Pittsburgh , PA ) , the latter as an internal control . Real - time PCR To quantify the presence of viral DNA in endosomal compartments , the E1A gene was amplified from endosomal fractions after sucrose gradient with primers ( IDT , Table 1 ) designed based on the HAdV - D37 genomic E1A nucleotide sequence [ 54 ] . Real - time PCR was performed with Fast SYBR Green master mix ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA ) with the following conditions , 40 cycles at 95°C ( 10 s ) , 55°C ( 20 s ) , and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min . To determine mRNA expression for caveolin - 1 and IL - 8 , total RNA was extracted from caveolin - 1 or scrambled siRNA transfected , HAdV - D37 infected cells , at 2 hr post - infection using TRIzol ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Total RNA was then treated with DNase I ( 1 unit ) ( New England BioLabs , Ipswich , MA ) at 37°C for 1hr . Two μg of the DNase treated RNA was subjected to reverse transcription with M - MLV reverse transcriptase ( Promega , Madison , WI ) and oligo dT 15 primers ( IDT ) . Primers for caveolin - 1 and IL - 8 were designed using Primer3 plus software ( http : / / www . bioinformatics . nl / cgi - bin / primer3plus / primer3plus . cgi ) , and synthesized by IDT ( Table 1 ) . The cDNAs were diluted by 1 : 10 and 1 µl was used for qRT - PCR using Fast SYBR Green master mix under the conditions : 40 cycles oat 95°C ( 30 s ) , 60°C ( 1 min ) , 72°C ( 30 s ) , and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min . A non - template control and endogenous control ( human GAPDH ) were measured for the relative quantification . The related expression levels were calculated by the 2 - ΔΔCT method against the untransfected / uninfected controls [ 99 ] . Src kinase assay Src activity assays were performed by using ProFluor® Src - Family Kinase Assay ( Promega , Madison , WI ) . One microgram of each endosomal fractions ( peptide substrate ) and 25 μl of 100 μM ATP was added to the reaction buffer and incubated for 60 min at room temperature , followed by the addition of protease reagent for another 60 min at room temperature . The reaction was then stopped by addition of stabilizer reagent . When there is no kinase activity , the peptide substrate remains nonphosphorylated , and the protease will remove all amino acids from the peptide substrate and liberate the highly Table 1 .

In the presence of active kinase , the peptide substrate will be phosphorylated , effectively blocking the protease activity and resulting in low fluorescence of the Src - Family Kinase R110 substrate . The resulting fluorescence is read at excitation wavelength 485 and emission wavelength of 530 nm . ELISA Mouse corneas were removed at 16 hr post infection ( n = 3 / group ) . Corneas were then homogenized in 400 µL of PBS with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ( PMSF ) , 1 µg / mL aprotinin , and 10 µg / mL leupeptin ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) . The lysates were centrifuged at 10 , 000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C , and the supernatants were used for ELISA . Mouse CXCL1 ( KC ) ( R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) protein detection was performed with commercially available sandwich ELISA kits with capture and detection antibodies , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Each sample and standard was analyzed in duplicate . The plates were read on a microplate reader ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) and analyzed ( SOFTmax ; Molecular Devices ) . Histopathology Upon euthanasia at 4 d post infection , mouse corneas were removed surgically , rinsed in PBS , and fixed with 10 % neutral buffered formalin for 24 hr at room temperature . After paraffin embedding , whole eyes were cut into 5 - μm - thick sections , mounted on positively charged slides and air dried overnight . After deparaffinization and rehydration , slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histology , coverslipped , and photographed ( Axiovert 135 ; Carl Zeiss Meditec , Inc . ) , using a 40× objective . Electron Microscopy Human corneal fibroblasts plated on 10 cm dishes and grown to 95 % confluence were infected with cesium chloride purified HAdV - D37 virus at a MOI of 10 , and incubated at 30 min at 4° C , followed by incubation at 37° C for 30 min . The cells were then washed with PBS , and fixed in 2 % paraformaldehyde containing 2 . 5 % gluteraldehyde , 0 . 1 M cacodylate and 2 . 5 mM CaCl 2 for 1 hr , and harvested in 2 % agarose . The cell pellet was fixed for 1 . 5 hr in 2 % aqueous OsO 4 , and dehydrated . Following dehydration , the cell pellet was embedded in epon and sectioned at 70 - 90 nm . The specimens were stained with saturated aqueous uranyl acetate , and Sato’s lead stain . Photomicrographs were taken on a Philips CM - 10 electron microscope ( Koninklijke Philips Electronics N . V . , Amsterdam , Netherlands ) operating at 80 kv and fitted with a CCD camera . Immunogold Electron Microscopy For immunostaining , cells were adsorbed with purified HAdV - D37 or mock infected with buffer for 30 min at 4° C , followed by incubation at 37° C for 30 min , washed in PBS , fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 1 hr , and harvested . Cells were treated with 2 . 3 M sucrose in PBS for 15 min , frozen and sectioned at - 120° C at 50 - 80 nm thickness , and transferred to formvar - carbon coated copper grids . Grids were blocked with 1 % BSA for 10 min and incubated for 30 min with 5 µl of rabbit polyclonal caveolin - 1 antibody , ( BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA ) at 25 µg / ml in 1 % BSA , followed by wash in PBS , and incubation with protein - A nanogold ( Cell Microscopy Center , Department of Cell Biology , University Medical Center , Utrecht , The Netherlands ) [ 100 ] with a particle size of 10 nm , for 20 min .
