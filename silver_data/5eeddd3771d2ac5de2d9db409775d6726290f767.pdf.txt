Homogeneity 2 DO PEOPLE MAKE THE PLACE ? AN EXAMINATION OF THE A ' l " l ' RACTION - SELECTION - A ' l ' TRITION HYPOTHESIS Abstract This study tests the hypotheses that ( 1 ) congruence between internal need states and external environments drives the organizational - choice process , and ( 2 ) those attracted to particular organizations are more homogeneous than the applicant pool in general . Subjects were evaluated on fourteen needs using the Jackson Personality Research Form . They then viewed two video - taped segments of simulated campus interviews to gain information about two distinct organizational types . The interview segments entered the discussion in - progress to avoid any reference to a particular job which might introduce an occupational confound . Subjects received job offers from both organizations and were asked to indicate which of the two organizations they found more attractive by accepting one of the offers . Analysis of variance results indicated only weak support for the congruency hypothesis . Differences were observed in n Ach between the groups of subjects attracted to each organization . No differences were found for any of the other need strength measures . This suggests that the subjects attracted to the different organizations are substantially similar . Implications for the homogeneity hypothesis are discussed and suggestions for further study of this concept are offered . Homogeneity 3 00 PEOPLE MAKE THE PLACE ? : AN EXAMINATIONOF THE ATTRACTION - SELECTION - ATTRITION HYPOTHESIS Schneider ( 1983 , 1987 ) has argued that over time , forces within an organization operate to attract , select , and retain an increasingly homogeneous group of employees . These individuals are hypothesized to share common backgrounds , characteristics , and orientations . As a result of this homogeneity , organizations are expected to become less able to respond to changes , threats , and opportunities in the external environment . Because of this , the organization enters a period of stagnation . Unless the powers that operate to create and perpetuate homogeneity are combated , stagnation will be followed by decline and eventual demise ( Schneider , 1983 ) . Organizations routinely engage in activity to identify and select individuals from the applicant population that are somewhat homogeneous . By relying on established recruiting sources ( e . g . specific universities for college recruiting ) , and established screening and selection techniques ( e . g . specific tests and minimum cut - off scores ) , organizations narrow the range of characteristics chosen applicants are likely to possess . In doing so , it appears that organizations often attempt to create , rather than stifle , homogeneity . Interactional psychology suggests how naturally occurring interactions between persons and settings operate to shape behavior ( Bowers , 1973 ) . This behavior in turn determines the organizational environment . Schneider ( 1987 ) develops an attraction - selection - attrition framework on the basis of interactionist ideology , and sets forth a series of propositions that suggest how homogeneity may develop as a result of these naturally occurring Homogeneity 4 interactions . While these propositions appear to be based on sound theoretical principles , there exists no known empirical investigation of the extent to which homogeneity exists among those attracted to the organization , those selected by the organization , or those retained in the organization . This study attempts empirical investigation of the homogeneity hypothesis at the attraction phase of the cycle . Organizational Search and Choice The degree to which individuals find organizations to be attractive is central to the organizational search and choice literature . The manner in which individuals evaluate and choose between available job alternatives has been studied in a number of ways . Economic debate over the processes used has focused on discussion of whether the choice follows a rational or irrational model ( e . g . Parnes , 1954 ; Rottenberg , 1956 ) . Direct estimation procedures have asked potential employees to rank or rate several predetermined job attributes in terms of their importance to the job choice ( Jurgensen , 1978 ) . Expectancy theory methodologies have used both between - subject , and within - subject applications to capture applicants ' decision - making models in mathematical expressions ( Arnold , 1981 ; Einhorn , 1971 ; Feldman & Arnold , 1978 ; Fischer , 1976 ; Huber , Daneshgar & Ford , 1971 ; Singh , 1975 ; Stahl & Harrell , 1981 ; Strand , Levine , and Montgomery , 1981 ; Rynes , 1981 ; Rynes , Schwab & Heneman , 1983 , and Zedeck , 1977 ) . Unfortunately , though this research concerns itself with identifying subjects ' attraction to organizations , it does not test the homogeneity question since subjects are not classified . As the notable exception , Zedeck ( 1977 ) used policy - capturing combined with " judgment analysis clustering " to classify subjects into groups on the Homogeneity 5 basis of similarity between their individual policy equations . His results suggest that subjects who are alike in their job choice decision making processes also display similarity on certain biographical factors ( e . g . age , sex , college major , and work experience ) . This result is important here since Zedeck has shown that organizational characteristics influence the organizational - choice process differently for different identifiable groups of people . A small body of literature addresses the role of congruence between person and setting in organizational choice . This handful of studies draws primarily on two theories from the occupational choice literature . Super ( 1953 ) views a person ' s career as a synthesis of the person ' s self concept and the realities of the occupational environment . Holland ( 1966 ) also assumes that person - situation congruence will drive the vocational choice . He hypothesizes an interaction between the individual ' s personality and the environment offered by the occupation . Organizational choice can be seen as the first step a person takes to implement an occupational choice ( Keon , Latack , and Wanous , 1982 ) . Since homogenization resulting from an attraction - selection - retention cycle is theoretically based on the interactionist notion of naturally occurring interactions between individuals and settings , the vocational choice theories that predict occupational choice on the basis of person - environment congruence are particularly applicable . Tom ( 1971 ) extended Super ' s ( 1953 ) proposition that vocational development is a process of implementing one ' s self concept by applying Super ' s theory to the problem of organizational choice . Tom asked subjects to describe themselves and two organizations : one they would most prefer to work for and one they would least prefer to work for . He found that the similarity Homogeneity 6 between how an individual described himself and how he described the organiza - tion he most preferred to work for was greater than the similarity between how he described himself and how he described the organization he least preferred to work for . A more recent application of person - environment congruence to organizational choice concerns the choice of a graduate school . Keon , Latack , and Wanous , ( 1982 ) examined the relationship between self - image and organizational choice . Previous research suggests that occupational choice and self - image are related ( Korman , 1966 ) . The authors report that this result extends to organizational choice as well . Within - subject correlational analysis between self - image and school image showed that for subjects with positive self - image , the greater the congruence between organization image and self - image , the more attractive the organization was . For subjects with negative self - image , less congruence between organization image and self - image was associated with higher levels of attractiveness . Since conflicting results are offered , little can be concluded about the drive to seek congruence . Noting the relationship between Type A behavior and several negative consequences , Burke and Deszca ( 1982 ) investigated the relationship between Type A behavior in graduating students and preference for particular organizational climates . Personality attributes used to describe Type A individuals include : ambition , competitiveness , hostility , need for achievement , and impatience . Type A behavior scores were related to working environments characterized by high performance standards , spontaneity , ambiguity , and toughness . The results are supportive of the individual - environmental congruency hypothesis . Homogeneity 1 Ellis and Taylor ( 1983 ) studied the role of self - esteem in the job search process . Subjects ' self - esteem was measured prior to the job search process . After four months of job search activity several relationships between self - esteem and search / outcome activity were noted . Self - esteem was related to sources used . Subjects with low self - esteem used more formal informational sources . Self - esteem was related to evaluation by interviewers . Subjects with higher self - esteem received better evaluations . Self - esteem was also related to several outcome variables . Number of job offers , acceptance of a position , and intended job tenure were all positively related to self - esteem . While this research does not examine the person - environment congruency issue , per se , it does provide support for Super ' s ( 1953 ) contention that self - image influences an individual ' s decision making process . Turning to Holland ' s ( 1966 ) theory of personality congruence , Niener and Owens ( 1985 ) used biographical data to predict job choice . Entering freshmen provided biographical data . Several years after graduation these same subjects completed a questionnaire describing their job . Jobs were then classified into one of the six Holland occupational types ( artistic , investigative , conventional , realistic , social , or enterprising ) . Discriminant analysis explained 24 % of the variation in job type for males and 20 % for women . Chance level is 16 . 67 % . The results suggest that a person ' s background and opportunity for skill and ability development do appear to influence both occupational and organizational choice . The authors suggest that this supports Holland ' s congruency hypothesis . The realistic job preview ( RJP ) literature is also based on congruency ( e . g . Wanous , 1980 ) . It posits that displaying an accurate preview of the job both reduces unrealistic expectations and allows applicants to self - select Homogeneity 8 out of incongruent environments . Unfortunately , this literature has focused on job characteristics and has not yet considered the impact of organizational information on applicants ' attraction to particular organizations . Taken as a whole , this literature suggest that the occupational choice framework appears to have merit for organizational choice as well . However , while these studies indicate that individuals may seek congruence between internalized characteristics and external conditions and thereby suggest support for the homogeneity hypothesis , they fall short of actually testing the degree to which individuals attracted to an organization are more or less alike than the population from which they were drawn . This study attempts to do that . If homogeneity exists at the attraction stage , initial support is indicated for the congruency and homogeneity hyPOtheses . If however , individuals attracted to particular organizations do not share common characteristics , the negative consequences resulting from increasing homogeneity appear less likely . Hypotheses Schneider ( 1987 ) suggests describing organizations in terms of what they reward , support , and expect . He further suggests that personality measures may be useful in determining which types of individuals are attracted to which types of organizations . Two personality dimension in particular seem to offer the highest potential for examining both the congruency and the homogeneity questions . The characteristics that describe need for achievement ( n Ach ) , include a focus on individual effort and achievement , competitive disposition , and a contest orientation toward mobility and reward allocation . These characteristics are highly congruent with reward systems characterized by Homogeneity 9 merit pay , individual performance appraisal , and promotion on the basis of proven ability . Alternatively , the characteristics that describe need for affiliation ( n Aff ) , include a desire for high levels of interaction , and a cooperative disposition . These characteristics are highly congruent with reward systems which encourage high degrees of cooperative work effort and distribute rewards on the basis of organizational performance through practices such as profit - sharing and bonuses . If vocational choice theories apply in the organizational attractiveness context , directional hypotheses are possible . In particular , subjects finding the individually - oriented system more attractive should display higher need for achievement while those finding the organizationally - oriented system more attractive should display higher need for affiliation . However , the homogeneity question is not dependent upon the congruency hypothesis . To test for homogeneity , the hypothesis need merely state that within group differences on individual characteristics ( such as , but not limited to n Ach and n Aff ) will be smaller than differences observed in the entire sample on these individual attributes . The groups of interest are defined by the choice of one organization or the other as described in the following section . Method To test for homogeneity it is first necessary to obtain measures of individual differences . The Jackson Personality Research Form ( PRF ) was used to assess subjects on their needs for achievement , affiliation , aggression , autonomy , dominance , endurance , exhibition , harm avoidance , impulsivity , nurturance , order , play , social recognition , and understanding . The PRF was Homogeneity 10 chosen over other measures of individual differences because it is firmly grounded in interactionist psychology by virtue of its direct association with Murray ' s ( 1938 ) model and taxonomy of person - setting interaction . The PRF is specifically designed to assess the personality dimensions formulated by Murray . Murray ' s original trait definitions have been reformulated in light of new theoretical and empirical developments , but the PRF follows directly from Murray ' s framework and remains true to Murray ' s apparent intent . The PRF also displays better psychometric properties than other tests of this type ( Anastasi , 1972 ) . Odd - even reliability coefficients range from . 48 to . 90 ; K - R 20 coefficients range from . 54 to . 86 ; and test - retest coefficients range from . 69 to . 90 . Additionally , the PRF has received consistently favorable critiques by subject matter experts ( Buros , 1972 , 1978 ) . Once individual differences are known , it is necessary to determine which organizations are attractive to which individuals . Two organizational types were created . One represented an environment that encouraged and rewarded individual behavior . The other encouraged and rewarded effort directed at the organization ' s collective wellbeing ( Staw , 1986 ) . Characteristics of each system are presented in Table 1 . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Table 1 Here - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Four video - taped segments of simulated campus interviews were created by crossing the two organizational types with two interviewers . Since the subjects would be viewing video - taped interview segments from both organizations , two interviewers were needed to create a more realistic manipulation . The interviewers ' appearance and dress were matched as closely Homogeneity 11 as possible and the design was balanced to minimize interviewer and order affects . The applicant in each tape was played by the same person . The applicant ' s responses were video - taped one time and edited into each tape in order to minimize variations on her part . Recall that the vocational choice literature offers substantial empirical evidence to suggest that particular types of people are attracted to specific occupations ( e . g . Super , 1953 ; Holland , 1966 ) . Therefore , any methodology that makes reference to a particular occupation risks confounding occupational choice with attraction for the particular organization . Most interview methodologies require reference to a particular job . To avoid this problem , the video - tapes used here enter the interview in - progress at a point where the applicant is asking the interviewer questions about the nature of the organization . The interviewer respQnds in a fashion consistent with the points outlined in Table 1 . Since the video - tape enters the interview in - progress , subjects are free to , and are encouraged to assume that the job in question is consistent with their occupational preferences . Therefore , organizational attractiveness , independent of occupational attributes should influence the subjects ' perceptions and subsequent decisions . To measure organizational attractiveness , subjects received job offers from both of the organizations portrayed in the interviews , and were asked to indicate which of the two they would rather join by accepting one of the offers . Subjects were reminded that the choice of one of the two companies precluded the other from any further consideration . This is a better measure of attractiveness than the more commonly used rating scales since it imposes a cost on the subject in the form of lost opportunity . It is also much more realistic and precludes the subjects from considering the alternatives to Homogeneity 12 be equally attractive ; an outcome that is common in procedures that ask applicants to rate the attractiveness of each organization . Subjects students approaching graduation , many of whom were currently engaged in the process of campus recruiting , were used as subjects . Subjects were enrolled in either an upper - level personnel management course or in an upper - level theory of the interview course at a large midwestern university . All subjects received course credit for participating . Subjects were mostly seniors ( 92 % ) enrolled in either the school of business ( 41 % ) or the college of liberal arts and sciences ( 53 % ) . The sample was 54 % male and many areas of occupational interest were represented : human resource management ( 27 % ) , sales ( 19 % ) , general management ( 17 % ) , accounting ( 9 . 5 % ) , marketing ( 8 . 5 % ) , and finance ( 4 % ) . The remainder of the sample indicated overlapping areas of interest or diverse areas such as ministry , farming , or law . Power analysis indicated that in order to detect a moderate effect ( f = . 25 ; where f is the standard deviation of the standardized group means ) with a power of . 80 , an alpha level of . 05 , a minimum sample size of 144 is required ( Cohen , 1977 ) . A total of 211 subjects completed the experiment therefore sample size is considered adequate . Procedure The video - tapes were pilot tested to insure that ( 1 ) the message intended to be conveyed by the tapes was actually being received , ( 2 ) the subjects were sufficiently able to put themselves into the role of the applicant and remove the possible occupational confound , and ( 3 ) any interviewer affect to place themselves in the role of the applicant were averaged to form the variable Occupational Confound . The greater the subject ' : > ' ability to assume that the interview in question was one in their area of interest , the more The experiment consisted of two phases . In the first phase , the PRF was administered . In the second phase , subjects were informed of the procedure that would follow and were given the opportunity to ask questions about the Homogeneity 13 would be minimized . Subjects viewed either the video - tape conveying individually - oriented information or the video - tape conveying organizationally - oriented information . They then responded to a questionnaire asking them to indicate the likelihood ( 1 = very unlikely to 5 = very likely ) of the organization engaging in specific activities ( e . g . How likely is it that this organization would have a profit - sharing plan ? ) . The responses to the individually - oriented questions were averaged to form the variable Individual System and the responses to the organizationally - oriented questions were averaged to form the variable Organizational System . Similarly , responses to questions about the interviewer were average to form the variable Interviewer Effect and responses to questions about the subjects ' ability likely it is that the occupational confound was removed . Table 2 shows that the manipulations were achieved , and that the occupational confound was controlled . The pilot study also indicated a marginally significant interviewer affect . To control for this the design was balanced so that an equal number of subjects viewed each organization being represented by each interviewer . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Table 2 Here - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Homogeneity 14 process . They were then told to listen carefully to the information in the video - tapes , to try to imagine that the job in question was one in their area of interest , to try to place themselves in the role of the applicant , and to be prepared to answer questions about the tapes upon their completion . Each tape lasted about five minutes . Upon completion of the tapes , subjects were given a fact sheet telling them that the organizations they had just previewed were essentially alike in regard to reputation , location , career opportunity and salary levels . They were informed that both had job openings in their area of interest , and that they would receive job offers from both organizations . They were then asked to consider the information presented in the video - tapes and choose one organization over the other ( i . e . accept one of the job offers ) realizing that doing so precluded the not - chosen organization from any furth€r consideration . A manipulation check questionnaire was then completed . The results are presented in Table 3 . The results are similar to those found in the pilot study . The manipulations were powerfully achieved and the occupational confound was controlled . An interviewer affect was noted but since the means were both highly favorable and the design was balanced , it does not represent a significant problem . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Table 3 Here - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Analysis In the initial analysis , n Ach and n Aff were used as the dependent variables and organization chosen was used as the independent variable . The Homogeneity 15 issue of concern is whether there are identifiable differences on the individual measures between the subgroups determined by organizational choice . Analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) is used to test the hypothesis . Discriminant function analysis was also used to test whether any possible combination of scores on the fourteen need strength measures derived from the PRF would predict organizational choice . Since choice indicates the relative attractiveness of the two alternatives , a constellation of need strength scores that predict choice would be indicative of a tendency toward homogeneity at the attraction stage . Results Preliminary results suggested only weak support for the directional hypothesis that the drive for congruence would cause those with a high need for achievement to find the individually - oriented system to be more attractive , and those with a high need for affiliation would find the organizationally - oriented system to be more attractive . ANOVA results show a weak effect for n Ach ( F = 3 . 177 , E = . 076 ) indicating that n Ach scores tended to be higher among subjects attracted to the individually - oriented system than they did among subjects attracted to the organizationally - oriented system . However , no differences were noted on n Aff between the two groups of subjects ( F = . 101 , E = . 750 ) indicating that subjects who find the individually - oriented system to be more attractive exhibit the same need for affiliation as do those attracted to the organizationally - oriented system . Complete ANOVA results are given in Table 4 .

The discriminant function was only able to correctly classify 60 % of the subjects on the basis of their need strength profiles . This result is well within the probability limits of occurring by chance ( Chi squared = 15 . 25 , E = . 437 ) . Results of the discriminant analysis are given in Table 5 . - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Table 5 Here - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Table 6 shows the mean scores and standard deviations for all need strengths for the combined sample and for the subsamples preferring each of the two organizations . There are no significant differences noted between the groups on any of the characteristics with the exception of n Ach . It appears that the subjects attracted to the individually - oriented system are very similar to those attracted to the organizationally - oriented system . In the absence of significant differences , it is not surprising that the discriminant function was unable to predict at better than chance level .

Because the characteristics that describe high need for achievement also seem to describe an individually - oriented organizational atmosphere , sound arguments can be made for expecting those with a high need for achievement to be attracted to environments that encourage and reward competitive , individual effort and accomplishment . It appears that to a limited degree the subjects in this study did self - select on the basis of n Ach . There was not however any effect noted for n Aff , thus precluding a strong argument in favor of homogeneity on the basis of drive for congruence . What is perhaps more revealing is the inability of the discriminant function to predict organizational preference on the basis of the entire need constellation provided by the PRF . While is it clear that need strengths are but one scheme upon which individuals may be classified ( e . g . Owens and Schoenfeldt , 1979 ) , they were chosen as the defining characteristics here because of their role in the interactionist ideology : People with similar needs are attracted to particular settings and tend to stay in those settings if their needs are met . Failure to find any meaningful combination of need Homogeneity 18 strengths that predict organizational preference casts doubt on the legitimacy of the homogeneity hypothesis at the attraction phase . Homogeneity can be detected in two ways . First , as with n Ach , the means between the two groups may be significantly different indicating that the characteristic in question is present to a greater degree in one group than in the other . However , absence of mean differences does not necessarily negate the possibility of homogeneity within the groups . It is possible that the means could be similar but that the degree of dispersion around the means might differ . This being the case , comparison of within group variances is indicated . Examination of the standard deviations in Table 6 reveals that the variances on these characteristics between organizations are also substantially similar . These arguments suggest that for this sample , the subjects attracted to one organization do not appear to be much different than those attracted to the other . Schneider ( 1987 ) downplayed the significance of experimental laboratory research on the basis that it generally included the random assignment of subjects to conditions and thereby subverted the interactionist ideology that people self - select into and out of situations . He also suggested that the use of personality measures " should be useful for identifying the types of people who cluster in different organizations " . This research has attempted to address those concerns and yet can not offer much support for Schneider ' s hypotheses . Perhaps other personality measures might offer different results but this is unlikely given the psychometric properties of the PRF vis a vis other instruments of this type ( Buros , 1972 , 1978 ) . The method in which organizations are described should also influence the degree to which individuals self - select . The organizations in this study Homogeneity 19 were described mainly in terms of their reward systems . The systems were described such that their internal characteristics were highly congruent and differences between what the two organizations reward , support , and expect were maximized . The manipulation check suggested that subjects were able to comprehend the differences between the systems described , so failure to find homogeneity can not be assigned to a misunderstanding of the organizational conditions . The experimental design used here focused subjects ' attention on a highly visible and important organizational dimension that is ( 1 ) likely to be known by applicants at the time they make job choices , and ( 2 ) theoretically linked to person - situation congruence . Furthermore , Schneider ( 1987 , p . 448 ) suggests that organizations can be classified on the basis of what they " reward , support , and expect " . The reward systems used in this study follow Schneider ' s recommendation by conveying information about what is important to the organizations . However , since other organizational characteristics also influence attractiveness , the homogeneity hypothesis cannot be rejected outright on the basis of these results . This research represents the first empirical investigation of the hypothesis and should serve as a model upon which future research can build to more completely test the legitimacy of the homogeneity hypothesis . Since this research has called into question homogeneity among a group of attracted subjects , more research using different individual measures and different organizational characteristics is called for . The use of student subjects may represent a problem . While this was not truly a convenience sample since the hypotheses apply to entry level positions and the degree of organizational attractiveness at that stage , there Homogeneity 20 are some problems associated with using student subjects . The major concern is that the majority of these subjects have never held a full - time job and many have not worked even part - time for more than one employer . Because of this , the concerns that others have voiced about the ability of student subjects to understand the message conveyed in the manipulation may be a problem here ( e . g . Rynes , Heneman , and Schwab , 1980 ; Schwab , 1982 ) . The argument is that because student subjects have so little job experience on which to draw , the relevant job - or organization - specific attributes conveyed in the manipulations may be irrelevant . Given the magnitude of the F statistics in the manipulation check , there can be no question that the subjects understood the differences between the organizations . However , given their lack of experience , they may have understood the differences but may not have known what working under each type of system would really be like . Further research with more experienced subjects may yield different results . The homogeneity question deserves further research . Different subject pools ( such as the use of non - student populations ) is just one area of possible exploration . The question should also be tested in field studies that actually examine the types of people that apply at different organizations . This would require in - depth analysis of the information that the applicant has about the organization at the time of application as well as analysis of some individual characteristics . This will only be an improvement over a laboratory study if we are able to ascertain what applicants know , or think they know about the organization when they apply . A cross - sectional approach could also be used to examine homogeneity within an organization . If it is true that homogeneity develops over time , one would expect lower levels of Homogeneity 21 homogeneity at the entry level , increasing amounts at middle levels , and the greatest amount at upper levels . Comparisons of mean and variance differences on individual characteristics at different organizational levels may be enlightening . Homogeneity 22 References Anastasi , A . ( 1972 ) .
