The Increasing Dominance of Teams in Production of Knowledge Stefan Wuchty , 1 * Benjamin F . Jones , 2 * Brian Uzzi 1 , 2 * † We have used 19 . 9 million papers over 5 decades and 2 . 1 million patents to demonstrate that teams increasingly dominate solo authors in the production of knowledge . Research is increasingly done in teams across nearly all fields . Teams typically produce more frequently cited research than individuals do , and this advantage has been increasing over time . Teams now also produce the exceptionally high - impact research , even where that distinction was once the domain of solo authors . These results are detailed for sciences and engineering , social sciences , arts and humanities , and patents , suggesting that the process of knowledge creation has fundamentally changed . A n acclaimed tradition in the history and sociology of science emphasizes the role of the individual genius in scientific dis - covery ( 1 , 2 ) . This tradition focuses on guiding contributions of solitary authors , such as Newton and Einstein , and can be seen broadly in the tend - ency to equate great ideas with particular names , such as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle , Eu - clidean geometry , Nash equilibrium , and Kantian ethics . The role of individual contributions is also celebrated through science ’ s award - granting in - stitutions , like the Nobel Prize Foundation ( 3 ) . Several studies , however , have explored an apparent shift in science from this individual - based model of scientific advance to a teamwork model . Building on classic work by Zuckerman and Merton , many authors have established a rising propensity for teamwork in samples of research fields , with some studies going back a century ( 4 – 7 ) . For example , de Solla Price ex - amined the change in team size in chemistry from 1910 to 1960 , forecasting that in 1980 zero per - cent of the papers would be written by solo au - thors ( 8 ) . Recently , Adams et al . established that over time , teamwork had increased across broader sets of fields among elite U . S . research universities ( 9 ) . Nevertheless , the breadth and depth of this projected shift in manpower remains indefinite , particularly in fields where the size of experiments and capital investments remain small , raising the question as to whether the projected growth in teams is universal or cloistered in specialized fields . A shift toward teams also raises new ques - tions of whether teams produce better science . Teams may bring greater collective knowledge and effort , but they are known to experience so - cial network and coordination losses that make them underperform individuals even in highly complex tasks ( 10 – 12 ) , as F . Scott Fitzgerald concisely observed when he stated that “ no grand idea was ever born in a conference ” ( 13 ) . From this viewpoint , a shift to teamwork may be a costly phenomenon or one that promotes low - impact science , whereas the highest - impact ideas remain the domain of great minds working alone . We studied 19 . 9 million research articles in the Institute for Scientific Information ( ISI ) Web of Science database and an additional 2 . 1 million patent records . The Web of Science data covers research publications in science and engineering since 1955 , social sciences since 1956 , and arts and humanities since 1975 . The patent data cover all U . S . registered patents since 1975 ( 14 ) . A team was defined as having more than one listed author ( publications ) or inventor ( patents ) . Following the ISI classification system , the universe of scientific publications is divided into three main branches and their constituent subfields : science and engineering ( with 171 subfields ) , social sciences ( with 54 subfields ) , and arts and humanities ( with 27 subfields ) . The universe of U . S . patents was treated as a separate category ( with 36 subfields ) . See the Supporting Online Material ( SOM ) text for details on these classifications . For science and engineering , social sciences , and patents , there has been a substantial shift toward collective research . In the sciences , team size has grown steadily each year and nearly 1 Northwestern Institute on Complexity ( NICO ) , North - western University , Evanston , IL 60208 , USA . 2 Kellogg School of Management , Northwestern University , Evanston , IL 60208 , USA . * These authors contributed equally to this work . † To whom correspondence should be addressed .

Shifts toward teamwork in science and en - gineering have been suggested to follow from the increasing scale , complexity , and costs of big science . Surprisingly then , we find an equally strong trend toward teamwork in the social sci - ences , where these drivers are much less notable . Although social scientists in 1955 wrote 17 . 5 % of their papers in teams , by 2000 they wrote 51 . 5 % of their papers in teams , an increase similar to that in sciences and engineering . Mean team size has also grown each year . On average , today ’ s social sciences papers are written in pairs , with a continuing , positive trend toward larger teams . Unlike the other areas of research , single authors still produce over 90 % of the papers in the arts and humanities . Nevertheless , there is a positive trend toward teams in arts and human - ities ( P < 0 . 001 ) . Lastly , patents also show a rising dominance of teams . Although these data are on a shorter time scale ( 1975 – 2000 ) , there was a similar annualized increase in the propen - sity for teamwork . Average team size has risen from 1 . 7 to 2 . 3 inventors per patent , with the positive trend toward larger teams continuing . The generality of the shift to teamwork is captured in Table 1 . In sciences and engineering , 99 . 4 % of the 171 subfields have seen increased teamwork . Meanwhile , 100 % of the 54 subfields in thesocial sciences , 88 . 9 % ofthe27subfields in the humanities , and 100 % of the 36 subfields in patenting have seen increased teamwork . Trends for individual fields are presented in table S1 . In the sciences , areas like medicine , biology , and physics have seen at least a doubling in mean team size over the 45 - year period . Sur - prisingly , even mathematics , long thought the do - main of the loner scientist and least dependent of the hard sciences on lab scale and capital - intensive equipment , showed a marked increase in the frac - tion of work done in teams , from 19 % to 57 % , with mean team size rising from 1 . 22 to 1 . 84 . In the social sciences , psychology , economics , and political science show enormous shifts toward teamwork , sometimes doubling or tripling the propensity for teamwork . With regard to average team size , psychology , the closest of the social sciences to a lab science , has the highest growth ( 75 . 1 % ) , whereas political science has the lowest ( 16 . 6 % ) . As reflected in Fig . 1A , the humanities show lower growth rates in the fraction of publications done in teams , yet a tendency toward increased teamwork is still observed . All areas of patents showed a positive change in both the fraction of papers done by teams and the team size , with only small variations across the areas of patenting , suggesting that the conditions favoring teamwork in patenting are largely similar across subfields . Our measure of impact was the number of citations each paper and patent receives , which has been shown to correlate with research quality ( 15 – 17 ) and is frequently used in promotion and funding reviews ( 18 ) . Highly cited work was defined as receiving more than the mean number of citations for a given field and year ( 19 ) . Teams produced more highly cited work in each broad area of research and at each point in time . To explore the relationship between team - work and impact in more detail , we defined the relative team impact ( RTI ) for a given time period and field . RTI is the mean number of citations received by team - authored work divided by the mean number of citations received by solo - authored work . A RTI greater than 1 indicates that teams produce more highly cited papers than solo authors and vice versa for RTI less than 1 . When RTI is equal to 1 , there is no difference in citation rates for team - and solo - authored papers . In our data set , the average RTI was greater than 1 at all points in time and in all broad research areas : sciences and engineering , social sciences , humanities , and patents . In other words , there is a broad tendency for teams to produce more highly cited work than individual authors . Further , RTI is rising with time . For example , in sciences and engineering , team - authored papers received 1 . 7 times as many citations as solo - authored papers in 1955 but 2 . 1 times the citations by 2000 . Simi - lar upward trends in relative team impact appear in sciences and engineering , social science , and arts and humanities and more weakly in patents , although the trend is still upward ( 20 ) . During the early periods , solo authors received substantially more citations on average than teams in many subfields , especially within sciences and engi - neering ( Fig . 2E ) and social sciences ( Fig . 2F ) . By the end of the period , however , there are almost no subfields in sciences and engineering and social sciences in which solo authors typical - ly receive more citations than teams . Table S1 details RTIs for major individual research areas , indicating that teams currently have a nearly uni - versal impact advantage . In a minority of cases , RTIs declined with time ( e . g . , – 34 . 4 % in mathe - matics and – 25 . 7 % in education ) , although even here teams currently have a large advantage in citations received ( e . g . , 67 % more average cita - tions in mathematics and 105 % in education ) . The citation advantage of teams has also been increasing with time when teams of fixed size are compared with solo authors . In science and engi - neering , for example , papers with two authors received 1 . 30 times more citations than solo au - thors in the 1950s but 1 . 74 times more citations in the 1990s . In general , this pattern prevails for comparisons between teams of any fixed size versus solo authors ( table S4 ) . A possible challenge to the validity of these observations is the presence of self - citations , giv - en that teams have opportunities to self - cite their work more frequently than a single author . To address this , we reran the analysis with all self - citations removed from the data set ( 21 ) . We found that removing self - citations can produce modest decreases in the RTI measure in some fields ; for example , RTIs fell from 3 . 10 to 2 . 87 in medicine and 2 . 30 to 2 . 13 in biology ( table S1 ) . Thus , removing self - citations can reduce the RTI by 5 to 10 % , but the relative citation advantage of teams remains essentially intact . Because the progress of knowledge may be driven by a small number of key insights ( 22 ) , we further test whether the most extraordinary con - cepts , results , and technologies are the province of solitary scientists or teams . Pooling all papers and patents within the four research areas , we calculated the frequency distribution of citations to solo - authored and team - authored work , com - paring the first 5 years and last 5 years of our data . If these distributions overlap in their right - hand tails , then a solo - authored paper or patent is just as likely as a team - authored paper or patent to be extraordinarily highly cited . Our results show that teams now dominate the top of the citation distribution in all four re - search domains ( Fig . 3 , A toD ) . Inthe earlyyears , a solo author in science and engineering or the social sciences was more likely than a team to receive no citations , but a solo author was also more likely to garner the highest number of cita - tions , that is , to have a paper that was singularly influential . However , by the most recent period , a team - authored paper has a higher probability of being extremely highly cited . For example , a team - authored paper in science and engineering is currently 6 . 3 times more likely than a solo - authored paper to receive at least 1000 citations . Lastly , in arts and humanities and in patents , in - dividuals were never more likely than teams to produce more - influential work . These patterns al - so hold when self - citations are removed ( fig . S5 ) . Fig . 1 . The growth of teams . These plots present changes over time in the fraction of papers and patents written in teams ( A ) and in mean team size ( B ) . Each line represents the arithmetic average taken over all subfields in each year . www . sciencemag . org SCIENCE VOL 316 18 MAY 2007 1037 REPORTS on M a y 18 , 20 07 www . sc i en c e m ag . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Taken together , these results suggest two im - portant facts about preeminent work in our obser - vational periods . First , it never appeared to be the domain of solo authors in arts and humanities and in patents . Second , solo authors did produce the papers of singular distinction in science and engi - neering and social science in the 1950s , but the mantle of extraordinarily cited work has passed to teams by 2000 . Over our 5 - decade sample period , the in - creasing capital intensity of research may have been a key force in laboratory sciences where the growth in teamwork has been intensive ( 8 ) , but it is unlikely to explain similar patterns in mathe - matics , economics , and sociology , where we found that growth rates in team size have been nearly as large . Since the 1950s , the number of researchers has grown as well , which could promote finer divisions of labor and more collaboration . Similarly , steady growth in knowl - edge may have driven scholars toward more specialization , prompting larger and more diverse teams ( 7 , 10 ) . However , we found that teamwork is growing nearly as fast in fields where the number of researchers has grown relatively slowly ( see Supporting Online Material ) . Declines in communication costs could make teamwork less costly as well ( 9 , 23 ) . Shift - ing authorship norms may have influenced co - authorship trends in fields with extremely large teams , suchasbiomedicineandhigh - energyphys - ics ( 24 , 25 ) , and yet our results hold across diverse fields in which norms for order of authorship , existence of postdoctorates , and prevalence of grant - based research differ substantially .

Citations received were counted from publication year to 2006 . Recent publications have smaller citation counts because they have had less time to be cited , but this effect is standardized when comparing team versus solo publications within a given year . 20 . In patenting , we may observe weaker trends because ( i ) citing earlier work can limit a patent ’ s scope , so that applicants may avoid citations , and ( ii ) patent examiners typically add the majority of citations , which makes patent citations different from paper citations ( 26 , 27 ) . 21 . A self - citation is defined as any citation where a common name exists in the authorship of both the cited and the citing papers . All citations were removed in which a citing and cited author ’ s first initial and last name matched . This method can also eliminate citations where the authors are different people but share the same name . However , performing Monte Carlo simulations on the data , we find that such errors occur in less than 1 of every 2000 citations . Thus , any errors introduced by this method appear negligible . We did not remove self - citations from patents because citations to previous work in the patent literature are primarily assigned by the patent examiner ( 27 ) , who independently assigns citations to earlier work based on the relevance of previous patents ’ content . 22 .

MET Amplification Leads to Gefitinib Resistance in Lung Cancer by Activating ERBB3 Signaling Jeffrey A .

Jänne 4 , 5 * The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib are effective treatments for lung cancers with EGFR activating mutations , but these tumors invariably develop drug resistance . Here , we describe a gefitinib - sensitive lung cancer cell line that developed resistance to gefitinib as a result of focal amplification of the MET proto - oncogene . inhibition of MET signaling in these cells restored their sensitivity to gefitinib . MET amplification was detected in 4 of 18 ( 22 % ) lung cancer specimens that had developed resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib . We find that amplification of MET causes gefitinib resistance by driving ERBB3 ( HER3 ) – dependent activation of PI3K , a pathway thought to be specific to EGFR / ERBB family receptors . Thus , we propose that MET amplification may promote drug resistance in other ERBB - driven cancers as well . T yrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) are an emerging class of anticancer therapies that have shown promising clinical activity . Gefitinib ( Iressa ) and erlotinib ( Tarceva ) inhibit the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) ki - nase and are used to treat non – small cell lung cancers ( NSCLCs ) that have activating mutations in the EGFR gene ( 1 – 4 ) . Although most EGFR mutant NSCLCs initially respond to EGFR in - hibitors , the vast majority of these tumors ulti - mately become resistant to the drug treatment . In about 50 % of these cases , resistance is due to the occurrence of a secondary mutation in EGFR ( T790M ) ( 5 , 6 ) . The mechanisms that contribute to resistance in the remaining tumors are unknown . To explore additionalmechanismsof gefitinib resistance , we generated resistant clones of the gefitinib hypersensitive EGFR exon 19 mutant NSCLC cell line , HCC827 , by exposing these cells to increasing concentrations of gefitinib for 6 months . The resultant cell line , HCC827 GR ( gefitinib resistant ) , and six clones isolated from single cells were resistant to gefitinib in vitro ( IC 50 > 10 m M ) ( Fig . 1A ) . Unlike in the parental HCC827 cells , phosphorylation of ERBB3 and Akt in the HCC827 GR cells was maintained in the presence of gefitinib ( Fig . 1B ) . We previously observed that EGFR mutant tumors activate phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) / Akt signaling through ERBB3 and that down - regulation of the ERBB3 / PI3K / Akt signal - ing pathway is required for gefitinib to induce apoptosis in EGFR mutant cells ( 7 , 8 ) . In addi - tion , persistent ERBB3 phosphorylation has also been associated with gefitinib resistance in ERBB2 - amplified breast cancer cells ( 9 ) . We therefore hypothesized that gefitinib resistance in EGFR mutant NSCLCs might involve sustained signaling via ERBB3 . After excluding the presence of a secondary resistance mutation in EGFR ( 10 ) , we investigated whether aberrant activation of another receptor might be mediating the resistance . We used a phospho – receptor tyro - sine kinase ( phospho - RTK ) array to compare the effects of gefitinib on 42 phosphorylated RTKs in HCC827 and HCC827 GR5 cells ( Fig . 1C ) . In the parental cell line , EGFR , ERBB3 , ERBB2 , and METwere all phosphorylated , and this phos - phorylation was either completely or markedly reduced upon gefitinib treatment . In contrast , in the resistant cells , phosphorylation of MET , ERBB3 , and EGFR persisted at higher levels in the presence of gefitinib ( Fig . 1C ) . We next performed genome - wide copy num - ber analyses and mRNA expression profiling of the HCC827 GR cell lines and compared them with the parental HCC827 cells ( fig . S1 and table S1 ) . The resistant but not parental cell lines showed a marked focal amplification within chro - mosome 7q31 . 1 to 7q33 . 3 , which contains the MET proto - oncogene ( Fig . 1D ) . MET encodes a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor for the hepatocyte growth factor ( scatter factor ) , and MET amplification has been detected in gastric and esophageal cancers ( 11 , 12 ) . Analysis by quanti - tative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) confirmed that MET was amplified by a factor of 5 to 10 in the resistant cells ( fig . S2 ) , and sequence analysis provided no evidence of mutations in MET . To determine whether increased MET signaling underlies the acquired resistance to gefitinib , we examined whether MET inhibition suppressed growth of the resistant cells . HCC827 GR cells were exposed to PHA - 665752 , a MET tyrosine kinase inhibitor , alone or in combination with gefitinib ( 13 ) . Although the HCC827 GR5 cells were resistant to both gefitinib alone and PHA - 665752 alone , combined treatment resulted 1 Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center , Boston , MA 02114 , USA . 2 Department of Systems Biology , Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA 02115 , USA . 3 Department of Signal Transduction , Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center , Boston , MA 02115 , USA . 4 Lowe Center for Thoracic Oncolo - gy , Dana - Farber Cancer Institute , Boston , MA 02115 , USA . 5 Department of Medical Oncology , Dana - Farber Cancer Institute , Boston , MA 02115 , USA . 6 Department of Thoracic Surgery , Aichi Cancer Center Hospital , Nagoya 464 - 8681 , Japan . 7 Department of Pathology , Brigham and Women ’ s Hospital , Boston , MA 02115 , USA . 8 Pfizer Global Research and Development , Department of Research Pharmacology , La Jolla Laboratories , La Jolla , CA 92121 , USA . 9 Istituto Clinico Humanitas , Department on Hematology - Oncology , Rozzano 20089 , Italy . 10 Department of Clinical Oncology , Chinese University of Hong Kong , Shatin , New Territories , Hong Kong , China . * To whom correspondence should be addressed .
