However , the regulatory mechanisms balancing cell - surface dynamics and bleb formation remain elusive . Here , we show that an acute reduction in cell volume activates clathrin - independent endocytosis . Hence , a decrease in sur - face tension is buffered by the internalization of the plasma membrane ( PM ) lipid bilayer . Membrane invagination and endocytosis are driven by the ten - sion - mediated recruitment of the membrane sculpt - ing and GTPase - activating protein GRAF1 ( GTPase regulator associated with focal adhesion kinase - 1 ) to the PM . Disruption of this regulation by depleting cells of GRAF1 or mutating key phosphatidylinosi - tol - interacting amino acids in the protein results in increased cellular blebbing and promotes the 3D motility of cancer cells . Our data support a role for clathrin - independent endocytic machinery in balancing membrane tension , which clariﬁes the previously reported role of GRAF1 as a tumor suppressor . INTRODUCTION The physical barrier of the cell comprises the plasma membrane ( PM ) , which impairs passive diffusion , and an actin cortex , which globally controls cellular rigidity . The actin cortex is cross - linked to the PM via protein and lipid interactions transferring the rigid physical properties of the cytoskeleton to the PM ( Braunger et al . , 2014 ; Raucher et al . , 2000 ) . This support is needed to withstand the tension on the lipid bilayer generated by intra - cellular hydrostatic pressure ( Diz - Mun ˜ oz et al . , 2013 ) . The cell surface is constantly reshaped and remodeled in response to extracellular cues , such as growth factors , nutrients , osmolarity , and pH , which continuously alter the association between the lipid bilayer and the cytoskeleton . One way of balancing membrane tension is by invagination or internalization of mem - branes through endocytic processes ( Anitei and Hoﬂack , 2011 ; Doherty and McMahon , 2009 ; Gauthier et al . , 2012 ) . Such pro - cesses have been proposed to build up a reservoir of internalized membrane , which can be used as membrane buffer to respond to changes in osmotic pressure and membrane tension ( Pietuch et al . , 2013 ; Raucher and Sheetz , 1999 ) . In addition to conven - tional receptor - mediated uptake , other mechanisms have been reported that drive endocytosis to manage alterations in cell sur - face area . It was recently shown that an unknown energy - depen - dent endocytic process rapidly mediates the turnover of excess PM during cell shrinkage ( Kosmalska et al . , 2015 ) . However , it is not yet clear how clathrin - dependent or clathrin - independent en - docytic systems respond to alterations in membrane tension . Endocytic membrane invaginations require the coordination of membrane sculpting and cytoskeletal rearrangements to over - come local rigidity caused by the adhesion between the PM and the cortical actin ( de Curtis and Meldolesi , 2012 ) . Members of the Rho family of small guanosine triphosphatase ( GTPases ) are key regulators of both actin polymerization and membrane trafﬁcking and play important roles in coordinating these events to balance membrane tension ( Bretou et al . , 2014 ; Masters et al . , 2013 ) . Altered activity of these GTPases has been shown to trigger membrane blebbing and rufﬂing , which inﬂuences cellular migration in three - dimensional ( 3D ) environments ( de Toledo et al . , 2012 ; Laser - Azogui et al . , 2014 ; Sahai and Marshall , 2003 ; Tozluo (cid:1) glu et al . , 2013 ) . Membrane blebs form due to the local disruption of membrane - actin cortex interactions resulting in spherical protrusions powered by the hydrostatic pressure ( Paluch and Raz , 2013 ) . GRAF1 regulates the activity of Rho GTPases and controls endocytosis via clathrin - independent carriers ( CLICs ) ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) . The Bin / amphiphysin / Rvs ( BAR ) and pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domains in GRAF1 mediate binding and tubula - tion of membranes enriched in phosphatidylinositol - ( 4 , 5 ) - bi - sphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) ( Doherty and Lundmark , 2009 ; Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) . CLICs coated by GRAF1 have been described to form following changes in cellular adhesion , spreading , and 2D migration ( Doherty et al . , 2011a ) . Cells lacking GRAF1 showed reduced levels of endocytosis and impaired cortical actin remodeling , integrin trafﬁcking , adhesion , and spreading , Cell Reports 20 , 1893 – 1905 , August 22 , 2017 ª 2017 The Author ( s ) . 1893 This is an open access article under the CC BY - NC - ND license ( http : / / creativecommons . org / licenses / by - nc - nd / 4 . 0 / ) .

Disruption of the gene encoding GRAF1 , ARH - GAP26 , was reported to result in a dramatic loss of an epithelial cellular phenotype and increased invasiveness ( Yao et al . , 2015 ) . Although GRAF1 has been implicated as a tumor suppressor in various invasive cancers ( Aly and Ghazy , 2014 ; Bojesen et al . , 2006 ; Borkhardt et al . , 2000 ; Qian et al . , 2011 ; Yao et al . , 2015 ) , the underlying mechanisms have yet to be resolved . In this study , we investigated how extracellular cues such as ﬂuctuationsinosmolaritycanactivateclathrin - independentendo - cytosisandinternalization ofPMtowardinternalmembranereser - voirs . We identify key structural features in GRAF1 essential for recruitment to membranes and show that depletion or mutation of GRAF1 has profound effects on surface dynamics , cellular blebbing , and cancercell invasionin 3D . In the contextof our ﬁnd - ings we believe that internalization of PM via CLICs constitutes a major cellular mechanism to buffer excess PM . This could serve as a way to suppress uncontrolled changes in cell morphology . RESULTS Clathrin - Independent Endocytosis Majorly Contributes to Membrane Internalization during Cell Volume Decrease As a tool to study PM internalization , the extracellular osmolarity can be altered . When cells are exposed to a hypertonic solution , they respond by decreasing their volume through water loss . To maintain the PM tension , excessive membrane is internalized leading to an increase in the pool of internal reservoir of mem - brane . Reversely , fusion of the internal membrane pool with the PM helps to balance the tension as the cell volume increases ( Figure 1A , scheme ) ( Pietuch et al . , 2013 ) . To visualize how acute cell volume changes affect the distribu - tion of membrane , we transfected cells with a ﬂuorescent mem - brane probe ( BFP - Mem ) . This probe binds to the PM and to a vesicular membrane pool and was used to quantify the PM reser - voir ( Kosmalska et al . , 2015 ) . For temporal control of the medium exchange during live - cell microscopy , a microﬂuidics system was used ( Figure 1A ) . Cells were ﬁrst imaged for ﬁve minutes ( ‘‘isotonic’’ ) and then exposed to water for ten minutes ( ‘‘hypo - tonic’’ ; Figure 1A ) . Segmentation of the cell surface area and the vesicular pool using software analysis tools showed a 2 - fold increase in cell volume as well as a decrease of the BFP - Mem labeled vesicular pool upon cell swelling ( Figures 1B and 1C ) . The water was then exchanged for isotonic medium . After ﬁve minutes , the volume was restored and BFP - Mem marked the reemergence of a vesicular membrane pool ( ‘‘recovery’’ ; Figures 1A – 1C ) . To study if clathrin - independent endocytosis contributed to the reemerging membrane reservoir , we generated a doxycy - cline - inducible Flp - In TRex HeLa ( FTH ) cell line expressing a GFP - tagged version of the CLIC regulator GRAF1 . To measure endocytosis , we determined the ﬂuid - phase uptake of ﬂuores - cent dextran - S - S - 650 in cells using an established assay ( Fran - cis et al . , 2015 ) . This showed that endocytosis was almost abol - ished during hypotonic treatment and increased by 2 . 5 - fold during the recovery phase ( Figure 1D ) . This response was inde - pendent of GFP - GRAF1 expression since non - induced FTH cells responded similarly . However , when cells were depleted of GRAF1 with small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) , we saw that the dextran uptake was signiﬁcantly reduced under isotonic condi - tions and even more pronounced during the recovery phase ( Fig - ure 1D ; see Figure 1E for protein levels ) . This showed that GRAF1 - dependent endocytosis participates in the recovery - induced compensation in ﬂuid - phase uptake . To establish the role of clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( CME ) , AP - 2 , an adaptor protein of this pathway , was knocked down using siRNA . Similar to the GRAF1 knockdown , ﬂuid - phase uptake was reduced at isotonic conditions , which is in agreement with previous data ( Francis et al . , 2015 ; Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) . During recovery , the uptake was not reduced to the same levels as in GRAF1 - depleted cells , suggesting that CME does not contribute to re - covery - induced endocytosis to the same degree . Together , these data indicate that GRAF1 is required for the internalization of membrane during acute volume decrease .

To monitor the effects of acute changes in cell sur - face volume and area on the dynamics of GRAF1 - coated CLICs , we used the microﬂuidic system and live imaged GFP - GRAF1 - induced cells . Following cell swelling , the majority of the GRAF1 punctae disappeared ( Figures 1F and S1A ) . However , during recovery GRAF1 was rapidly reassembled into bright punctae at the cell surface . Most of the assemblies were de - tected close to the basal cell surface ( see side view in Fig - ure S1A ) . Quantiﬁcation of the GFP - GRAF1 - coated structures in this z - plane revealed that the number of assemblies increased by approximately 50 % at four minutes of the recovery phase and normalized after eight minutes ( Figure 1F ; Movie S1 ) . Subjecting cells to hypertonic conditions by adding 100 mM NaCl or 2 mM dextran solution , also induced the formation of increasing amounts of punctuate and tubular PM structures coated with GRAF1 ( Figures S1B – S1D ) . This showed that GRAF1 was re - cruited to the cell surface in response to acute volume decrease and reduced membrane tension . To test if this feature was unique for GRAF1 , we also analyzed SNX9 , another BAR - domain - containing protein , which partici - pates in the late steps of clathrin - dependent endocytosis ( Lund - mark and Carlsson , 2003 ; Na´ndez et al . , 2014 ; Posor et al . , 2013 ) . As for GRAF1 , we found that SNX9 punctuate assemblies disappeared following hypotonic treatment , but in contrast , SNX9 reassembled at the PM already after one minute and re - mained at a constant number similar to that seen before the water treatment ( Figure 1G ; Movie S2 ) . Recovery of cells from hypotonic treatment has been found to induce mechanical remodeling of the basal PM due to entrap - ment of secreted water between the PM and a glass surface . This typically results in formation of large invaginations and vac - uole - like dilations ( VLDs ) and is quickly counteracted by active endocytosis ( Kosmalska et al . , 2015 ) . We also noticed this phe - nomenon and could conﬁrm , as previously shown ( Vidal - Quad - ras et al . , 2017 ) , a very clear recruitment of GRAF1 to VLDs one to two minutes after formation ( Figure S2A ) . In contrast , SNX9 was very rarely assembled at VLDs ( Figure S2B ) , suggest - ing that GRAF1 , but not SNX9 , is involved in the endocytic response to VLD formation . Together , our data show that GRAF1 is recruited to the cell surface in the presence of excess membrane and reduced PM tension . This was found to be a distinct feature of GRAF1 , which may imply a role of CLICs in balancing cell surface tension via endocytosis of membrane . Membrane Tension Sensitivity Is Conveyed by the BAR and PH Domains in GRAF1 To address which domains of GRAF1 are required for its mem - brane recruitment following tension decrease , we generated sta - ble cells expressing truncated versions of GRAF1 ( scheme in Figure 2A ) . The GFP tag was placed at the C terminus to prevent degradation of the truncated protein variants . Using spinning disk microscopy , the number of GRAF1 assemblies was tracked during isotonic and hypotonic conditions as well as during the re - covery phase . Moving the tag from the N - terminal to the C - termi - nal did not affect the response of GRAF1 to these treatments ( Figures 1D and 2A ) . Surprisingly , we found that removal of the SH3 domain or both the SH3 and GAP domain did not impair the ability of the protein to be recruited during recovery . In fact , a protein construct containing just the BAR - PH domains dis - played an increased rate of assembly during the ﬁrst three mi - nutes of recovery ( Figure 2B ) . Furthermore , the recruitment of the BAR - PH protein to VLDs was even more pronounced than that of the full - length GRAF1 , and BAR - PH - coated tubules were frequently emanating from the VLDs before their disap - pearance ( Figure 2B ; Movie S3 ) . This suggested that the BAR and PH domains are sufﬁcient to mediate membrane recruitment following tension decrease and that the GAP and SH3 domains are not important for this but might have other regulating roles . It has previously been shown that positively charged amino acids ( K131 / K132 ) in the BAR domain are required for membrane binding in vivo and that GRAF1 speciﬁcally binds to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - enriched liposomes via the BAR and PH domains ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) . The BAR domain cannot be individually puriﬁed , suggesting that the BAR and the PH domains form a structural unit . It is not clear , however , if the PH domain participates in membrane binding or other interactions ( Lenoir et al . , 2015 ) . Based on the homologous protein ACAP1 ( Pang et al . , 2014 ) , we generated a structure model of the BAR - PH dimer of GRAF1 . The positive charge distribution in the model suggested thattheBARandPHdomainsmightformacontinuousmembrane interaction surface ( Figure 2C ) . To test the membrane binding of the PH domain , we compared it to the PH domain of phosphoino - sitide phospholipase C ( PLC ) and the joint BAR - PH domains in liposome - sedimentation assays . The data show that the puriﬁed PH domain of GRAF1 interacted weakly with phosphatidyl serine ( PS ) or PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - enriched liposomes on its own ( Figure 2D ) . This suggests that the PH domain might serve other roles or that the orientation of a larger combined interface encompassing the BAR and PH domains are critical for binding to membranes . Membrane Binding Is Supported by a Positive Ridge and Hydrophobic Amino Acids in the PH Domain of GRAF1 PH domains have been shown to bind to phospholipids via a canonical and / or an atypical site surrounding a conserved loop ( Lenoir et al . , 2015 ) . To test if the PH domain contributes to mem - brane binding in the context of the BAR domain , we introduced mutations in the loop 1 region of the PH domain in a truncated construct containing only the BAR and the PH domain . Expres - sion of BAR - PH GFP in cells showed typical membrane tubules ( Figure 3A ) . However , when mutations disrupting a positively charged ridge in the structure model ( Figure 2C ) were introduced ( K277E / R278Q ) , these structures were not observed , suggesting that its membrane recruitment was impaired ( Figure 3A ) . To test if these residues directly inﬂuenced membrane bind - ing , we performed liposome sedimentation assays with puriﬁed BAR - PH - GAP regions of wild - type and mutated GRAF1 pro - teins . To increase stability of the puriﬁed proteins , the GAP domain was included . We used liposomes with PS or PS plus PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 or liposomes generated from Folch extracts . Co - sedi - mentation of BAR - PH - GAP proteins with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing liposomes and Folch liposomes showed that nearly 50 % of the protein was bound to the liposomes . Conversely , only approxi - mately 25 % of the protein was bound to liposomes containing only PS ( Figure 3B ) , which is in agreement with that GRAF1 binds to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) .

Cell Reports 20 , 1893 – 1905 , August 22 , 2017 1897 ( legend on next page ) 1898 Cell Reports 20 , 1893 – 1905 , August 22 , 2017 was signiﬁcantly decreased by around 50 % compared to wild - type showing that the positively charged ridge generated around loop 1 is critical for membrane binding of GRAF1 . To further analyze the membrane interacting interface of the PH domain , we established a model system using GROMACS bioinformatics to simulate the interaction between the PH domain and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - enriched membranes . With this approach , we found that the PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 interface spanned a larger surface including seven positively charged amino acids involving both the canonical and atypical sites ( Figures 3C and 3D ) . When approximating the simulated PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 contact - interface to the BAR - PH dimer , we saw that it surrounds two exposed phenylal - anines ( F280 and F303 ) in the modeled structure of the BAR - PH dimer ( Figures 3D and 3E , contact - interface highlighted in blue ) . Interestingly , the homologous F280 in ACAP1 was found deeply inserted into the membrane ( Pang et al . , 2014 ) . In comparison , the interface of a K277E / R278Q mutated version of the PH - domain with PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - enriched membrane resulted in half the amount of contacts to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and altered orientation of the PH domain and no contact interphase around F303 ( Figures 3D and 3E ) . By mutating F280 and F303 to alanines in GRAF1 , we found that both these residues were essential for the localiza - tion of the BAR - PH protein to tubular membranes in the cell and for binding to liposomes in vitro ( Figures 3F and 3G ) . This suggested that a larger combined interface in GRAF1 encom - passing the BAR and PH domains are critical for binding to mem - branes and to position a positive ridge spanning around K277 / R278 to favor the potential insertion of F280 and F303 into membranes . GRAF1 Suppresses Cellular Blebbing To test the effect of the K277E / R278Q mutation in vivo , we gener - ated stable - inducible FTH cells expressing GFP - GRAF1 ( K277E / R278Q ) . We conﬁrmed that these cells were completely devoid of GRAF1 assemblies ( Figure 4A ; Movie S4 ) . Recovery experi - ments combined with dextran uptake assays showed that ﬂuid - phase endocytosis was signiﬁcantly inhibited in these cells under isotonic conditions but also during recovery from hypotonic treat - ment ( Figure S3B ) . Interestingly , cells expressing GRAF1 ( K277E / R278Q ) appeared much blebbier compared to cells expressing GFP - GRAF1 ( Movie S4 ) . To study cellular blebbing , cells were ﬁxed and stained with non - muscle myosin IIA antibody and the number of cells with the entire cell surface covered in blebs was determined ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . Quantiﬁcation revealed that expression of GFP - GRAF1 , but not GFP - GRAF1 ( K277E / R278Q ) , reduced blebbing as compared to non - induced cells ( Figure 4B ) . By contrast , depletion of GRAF1 increased blebbing ( Figures 4B and S4C for protein levels ) . These results were conﬁrmed with live - cellimaging ( MoviesS4andS5 ) andcorrelativelightandelec - tron microscopy ( Figures S4A and S4B ) . This implied that GRAF1 has a major role in controlling membrane tension and preventing cellular blebbing . Cells can respond to a decrease in membrane tension by rein - forcement through cortical stress ﬁbers ( Burridge and Wittchen , 2013 ) . To investigate how GRAF1 expression affects the cortical actin , the cellular actin cytoskeleton was stained with phalloidin . We observed that the number of cells with ventral stress ﬁbers decreased following GFP - GRAF1 expression but increased following GRAF1 depletion ( Figures 4A and 4C ) , which is in agreement with previous results ( Taylor et al . , 1999 ) . An increased number of cells with ventral stress ﬁbers was also seen when GRAF1 ( K277E / R278Q ) was expressed ( Figures 4A and 4C ) . Stress ﬁber formation is characteristic for an increased RhoA activity , which can result in membrane blebbing ( Gadea et al . , 2007 ) . GRAF1 has previously been shown to downregulate RhoA activity ( Stergiou et al . , 2013 ) . Therefore , the previously characterized GAP - domain mutant GFP - GRAF1 ( R412D ) ( Fran - cis et al . , 2015 ; Jelen et al . , 2009 ) was expressed to investigate its impact on cellular blebbing and stress ﬁber formation . This mutant did not signiﬁcantly affect membrane endocytosis and blebbing ( Figures S4D and S4E ) . However , the number of cells with stress ﬁbers was increased , similarly to the K277E / R278Q mutant ( Figures 4C and S4D ) . Together , these data suggest that membrane recruitment of GRAF1 suppresses membrane blebbing by coordinated RhoA downregulation and membrane internalization . Membrane shrinkage and cortical actin remodeling have been predicted to cooperate to retract blebs ( Woolley et al . , 2015 ) . To study the activity of GRAF1 during blebbing , membrane blebbing was induced by inhibiting the polymerization of tubulin microﬁla - ments using nocodazole ( Samson et al . , 1979 ) . Time - lapse confocal microscopy of cells expressing GFP - GRAF1 and Life - Act - RFP showed that actin covered most of the inside of the no - codazol - induced blebs during retraction ( Figures 4D and 4E ) .

Cell Reports 20 , 1893 – 1905 , August 22 , 2017 1899 ( legend on next page ) 1900 Cell Reports 20 , 1893 – 1905 , August 22 , 2017 This result was in agreement with contractile cortical actin being assembled during membrane bleb retraction ( Charras et al . , 2006 ) . Interestingly , although GRAF1 assemblies formed at the cell surface during blebbing , they were never detected inside blebs , and their numbers did not change following nocodazole treatment ( Figures 4D and 4E ) . This suggested that GRAF1 is not involved in retraction of established blebs ( Figure 4D ) but rather that it is important to prevent blebbing . Cancer Cell Invasion Is Inhibited by GRAF1 Recently , it has become clear that the 3D motility of cancer cells gradually increases when cells transition from epithelial to mesenchymal to amoeboid - like cellular morphologies ( Charras and Paluch , 2008 ; Laser - Azogui et al . , 2014 ; Liu et al . , 2015 ) . As GRAF1 depletion leads to a spontaneous polarization with an elongated cellular morphology ( Doherty et al . , 2011a ; Vidal - Quadras et al . , 2017 ; Yao et al . , 2015 ) and higher percentage of cells show global cell - surface blebbing , we hypothesized that these cells may have increased 3D motility . To study this , we performed 3D invasion assays comparing cells expressing GFP - GRAF1 , GFP - GRAF1 ( K277E / R278Q ) and cells depleted of GRAF1 . Cells were seeded into 3D migration chambers in fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) depleted medium and were allowed to invade through Matrigel - ﬁlled pores to a medium containing 10 % FBS as a chemoattractant ( Figure S5A ) . Imaging analysis and quantiﬁcation of the number of invading cells showed that cells expressing GFP - GRAF1 ( K277E / R278Q ) or cells lacking GRAF1 were signiﬁ - cantly more invasive as compared to GFP - GRAF1 - expressing cells treated with control siRNA ( Figures 5A and 5B ) . To clarify if membrane blebbing was contributing to the invasiveness of these cells , we treated cells with blebbistatin , which is known to inhibit myosin II and the formation of membrane blebs ( Straight et al . , 2003 ) . Notably , this treatment abolished the increased invasiveness observed in cells expressing GFP - GRAF1 ( K277E / R278Q ) or in cells depleted of GRAF1 ( Figures 5A and 5B ) . To ensure that this effect was not restricted to FTH cells , we tested the non - invasive colon cancer cell line SW480 . Depletion of GRAF1 in SW480 cells ( Figure S5D ; see also Figure S5B for relative GRAF1 expression ) also signiﬁ - cantly increased the invasive behavior in 3D ( Figure 5C ) . The stronger invasiveness observed was dependent on blebbing since cell numbers of samples treated with blebbistatin were comparable to control without blebbistatin treatment ( Figures 5C and S5D ) . These data show that increased blebbing due to loss of GRAF1 activity dramatically increased the invasive behavior of cancer cells . In summary , our ﬁndings demostrate that reduced membrane tension triggers GRAF1 recruitment to the cell surface to facilitate membrane internalization and RhoA regulation to restrict blebbing and subsequent invasion in 3D . DISCUSSION In the present study , we show that GRAF1 , a regulator of clathrin - independent endocytosis , is activated and recruited to the PM upontensiondecreaseinordertoendocytoseexcessmembrane . We further revealed that GRAF1 depletion provokes cell blebbing and by using a 3D migration assay we demonstrate for the ﬁrst timethatcellslacking GRAF1migrateandbecomemoreinvasive . Earlier studies linked the loss of or inactivation of the gene tran - script to various forms of cancer , which indicated a role of GRAF1 as a tumor suppressor ( Aly and Ghazy , 2014 ; Bojesen et al . , 2006 ; Borkhardt et al . , 2000 ; Qian et al . , 2011 ; Yao et al . , 2015 ) . Moreover , loss of GRAF1 has previously been shown to affectcellspreadingandmigrationin2D ( Dohertyetal . , 2011a ; Hil - debrand et al . , 1996 ) resulting in spontaneous polarization and distortion of the 3D organization of cells ( Vidal - Quadras et al . , 2017 ) . ItwaspreviouslyreportedthatdisruptionofGRAF1expres - sion causes a cellular morphology similarly observed for cancer cells undergoing epithelial to mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , which supports our ﬁndings ( Regev et al . , 2017 ; Yao et al . , 2015 ) . Although previous studies propose that GRAF1 inhibits EMT , they do not explain the major principles governing mainte - nance of the epithelial phenotype . Our ﬁndings demonstrate the underlying principles for the control of membrane tension via endocytosis of excess PM and coordination of GTPase activity . Previously , the motility of cells was thought to occur only through the formation of lamellipodia . However , cancer cells for instance make use of other forms of protrusive structures , such as blebs ( Paluch and Raz , 2013 ) . The ability of metastatic cancer cells to switch between these different modes of migra - tion enables the adaption to varied environments , which contrib - utes to their high degree of invasiveness ( Paluch and Raz , 2013 ) . Our data clearly show that GRAF1 depletion enhances bleb - based migration of FTH cells and that of a colon cancer cell line . Furthermore , our results indicate that a lack of GRAF1 re - sults in profound membrane blebbing and the formation of stress Figure 4 .

Cell Reports 20 , 1893 – 1905 , August 22 , 2017 1901 ﬁbers , highlighting the role of GRAF1 in coordinating dynamics at the cell surface . Endocytosis is believed to be an important factor for removing excess membrane ( Pietuch et al . , 2013 ) , but at present , the roles of speciﬁc endocytic systems are not understood . Although cav - eolae have been shown to be mechanosensors , the membrane capacity of these invaginations is not sufﬁcient to account for Figure 5 .

All error bars represent mean ± SEM . See also Figure S5 . membraneinternalizationduringacutevol - ume decrease ( Kosmalska et al . , 2015 ) . Our ﬁndings show that clathrin - indepen - dent endocytosis is a major participant in membrane buffering , but also that cla - thrin - dependent endocytosis is partly involved in membrane uptake . Clathrin - dependentendocytosismediatesincorpo - ration of speciﬁc receptors into vesicles and might therefore serve to readjust the levels of surface exposed receptors and subsequently membrane area . We further propose that clathrin - independent ma - chinerycouldratherbeviewedasasystem to quickly turnover the PM lipid bilayer toward the internal membrane reservoir without receptor speciﬁcity . This would be in agreement with that a vast variety of receptors and main PM constituents were detected in mass spectrometric analysis of membrane carriers from this pathway ( Howes et al . , 2010 ) . Consis - tently , GRAF1 is recruited to dynamic areas of the cellular PM , where large amounts of membrane is constantly being remodeled , such as at the leading edge of amigratingcell ( Francisetal . , 2015 ; Howes et al . , 2010 ) . Recently , yeast membrane invaginations termed eisosomes were described to form a membrane reservoir by which the yeast cell can respond to changes in osmolarity ( Ka - becheetal . , 2015a , 2015b ) . Eisosomesareprimarilycomposedof the BAR domain proteins Pil1 and Lsp1 that , much like GRAF1 , bind and tubulate PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 containing membrane ( Karotki et al . , 2011 ; Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) . Here , we describe a similar system for mammalian cells . BAR domain containing proteins are known to cluster and create stable microdomains of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the lipid 1902 Cell Reports 20 , 1893 – 1905 , August 22 , 2017 bilayer ( Zhao et al . , 2013 ) . Thus , it is possible that GRAF1 mediate speciﬁc membrane tension sensitive internalization of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to control actin assembly at the PM . In agreement with previous ﬁndings ( Yao et al . , 2015 ) , our data suggest that GRAF1 negatively regulates RhoA and thus pre - vents stress ﬁber and membrane bleb formation . This is further supported by studies showing that the GAP domain of GRAF1 is important for the regulation of small GTPases , such as Cdc42 and RhoA ( Doherty et al . , 2011b ; Francis et al . , 2015 ; Hil - debrand et al . , 1996 ; Taylor et al . , 1999 ) . The GAP regulatory ac - tivity might be tightly coupled to the membrane remodeling ac - tivity of GRAF1 . We show , in agreement with previous work ( Lundmark et al . , 2008 ) , that the BAR and the PH domain are the only domains required for membrane binding . Furthermore , we establish that the PH domain is highly important for mem - brane localization as mutations in the PH domain prevent mem - brane recruitment of GRAF1 . Our data suggest that the BAR and the PH domains form a combined lipid - interacting surface that facilitates recruitment to the PM following reduced membrane tension . This dual activity might enable GRAF1 to spatially direct the GAP activity to curved membranes during invagination to regulate the activity of small GTPases . Hereby , endocytic turn - over of excess PM can progress until hydrostatic pressure and the counteractive force from the cortical actin has reached equi - librium . It was previously shown that transient membrane local - ization of a similar protein in C . elegans , SPV - 1 , containing a F - BAR domain coupled to a RhoGAP domain , can provide feed - back between a mechanical signal ( membrane stretching ) and actomyosin contractility ( Tan and Zaidel - Bar , 2015 ) . This sug - gests that transient recruitment of speciﬁc protein systems in response to changes in membrane tension might be a general feature needed across species to adjust to external stimuli . The work described here highlights the critical role of GRAF1 in regulating endocytic membrane sculpting , which reduces cell surface area and therefore membrane tension . Blebbing , a mechanism employed during cellular motility , requires excess PM and our research demonstrates that the endocytic activity of GRAF1 plays an inhibitory role in this process . GRAF1 serves as a mechanistic link between the control of membrane remod - eling and blebbing . Given the role of blebbing in invasive can - cers , our work provides valuable fundamental knowledge about the role of GRAF1 as a tumor suppressor . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Cell Lines FTH cell lines expressing various ﬂuorescently tagged GRAF1 proteins were generated by co - transfecting pcDNA5 / FRT / TO ( + ﬂuorescent protein ) con - structs with the Flp recombinase - encoding plasmid pOG44 ( Invitrogen ) into FTH cells as described by the manufacturer ( Invitrogen ) . The FTH cells were a kind gift from Stephen S . Taylor ( University of Manchester ) . The cell lines wereroutinely usedwith24hrof1ng / mldoxycyclinetoinducelowexpression of ﬂuorescently tagged GRAF1 . SW480 colorectal cancer cells were a kind gift from Richard Palmqvist ( Department of Medical Biosciences , Umea˚ University , Sweden ) . Cell Culture All cell lines were cultured in DMEM ( 4 . 5 mg / ml glucose , L - glutamine , sodium pyruvate , HEPES , and phenol red ) , supplemented with 10 % FBS ( GIBCO ) . FTH cell lines with tetracycline - inducible expression of tagged GRAF1 variants were cultured in media supplemented with 100 m g / ml hygromycin B and 5 m g / ml blasticidin S HCl ( Invitrogen ) . Unless otherwise stated , all plastic - ware for cell culturing was from Sarstedt . Quantiﬁcation of GRAF1 Assemblies in Cells The intensity threshold was manually adjusted to cover visible spots and the spot populations were analyzed using the colocalization function with a distance threshold of 1 . Assemblies were counted by a semi - automated approach using Imaris Software ( v . 7 . 5 ) ( Bitplane ) or the plugin Feature J Lap - lacian in ImageJ to analyze 3D micrographs or maximum - projected confocal z stacks from live - cell imaged cells . Fluorescent Microscopy Images of ﬁxed cells and living cells were captured using a 60 3 lens ( Plan - Apochromat 1 . 40 3 Oil DIC 0 . 17 ) A1 R Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope system ( Nikon Instruments ) under the control of NIS - Elements Microscope Imaging Software . Recovery Experiment and DIC Imaging For the live - cell experiments , the CellASIC ONIX microﬂuidics system ( Milli - pore ) was used to control the perfusion of cells loaded into a microﬂuidic plate ( Millipore cat . no . M04S - 03 ) attached to the stage of the microscope . The microﬂuidic plate was loaded with induced FTH cells 24 hr before the experi - ment , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The experiment was per - formed using medium removal at 5 psi for 1 min , followed by constant ﬂow at 0 . 25 psi , both for water addition ( hypotonic treatment ) and for medium add - back ( recovery ) . The cells were imaged using a Zeiss Cell Observer Spinning Disk Confocal controlled by ZEN interface with an Axio Observer . Z1 inverted microscope with a 63 3 lens ( Plan - Apochromat 1 . 40 3 Oil DIC M27 ) equipped with a CSU - X1A 5000 Spinning Disk Unit and an EMCCD camera iXon Ultra from ANDOR . All live - cell confocal images and movies were recorded in a 37 (cid:1) atmosphere with 5 % CO 2 . Micrographs and acquired movies were pre - pared ( cropped , rotated , linearly adjusted for intensity , and converted ) using ImageJ and Adobe Photoshop . Invasion and Migration Assay Cellular motility in 3D was measured using Corning BioCoat Matrigel Invasion and Migration Chamber ( Corning , Discovery Labware , Bedford , MA ) . The collagen layer of the cell culture inserts was rehydrated by adding 500 m L of serum - free media to the inner compartment , and 1 3 10 5 FTH cells or 2 . 5 3 10 5 SW480 cells were plated into each chamber insert in serum - free media withDMSO ( untreated ) or100 m Mblebbistatin ( dissolvedinDMSO ) . Thecham - ber inserts were then transferred to a 24 - well plate ﬁlled with 500 m L media supplemented with 10 % FBS as a chemoattractant . The cells were incubated for 24 hr at 37 (cid:1) C with 5 % CO 2 . After incubation , non - invasive cells were removed from the interior of the inserts . Invasive cells on the exterior side of theinsertmembranewere photographed using anOlympus BX50microscope witha20 3 / 0 . 5objective lengthafterstainingwithCellStainSolution ( CellBio - labs , San Diego , CA ) .
