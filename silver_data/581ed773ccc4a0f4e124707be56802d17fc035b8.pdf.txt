In the eukaryotic model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae , the brewer’s or baker’s yeast , polarity is evident during the cell cycle when budding has to happen at a distinct site of the mother cell to give rise to a daughter cell . Budding is genetically determined in this process to follow precise patterns : haploid a - and α - cells bud in an axial fashion , by which mother as well as daughter cells bud predominantly at the proximal cell pole ; diploid a / α cells of the yeast cell form bud in a bipolar manner with the budding process initiating equally at the proximal and distal cell pole . A variety of S . cerevisiae genes and their products are required for the establishment of such budding patterns . According to a current model , components of a polarity - mediating signal transduction cascade are directed by specific marker proteins to the budding pole to result in reorganisation of cytoskeletal components and to initiate bud formation . Previous studies had characterised the gene products Bud8p and Bud9p as spatial markers and polarity determinants , however without gaining further insights related to their function and role in polarity establishment in yeast . The results of this thesis describe , besides co - localisation studies , a detailed structure - function analysis based on mutant Bud8 and Bud9 proteins ; as a result , regions in each primary structure could be identified that are necessary for function , i . e . mediating the correct budding pattern , for localisation , or for interaction with specific components of a signal transduction module called the ‘polarisome’ . Distinct regions presumably mediate interaction with Bud5p , which is an element of a GTPase signalling module , and with Rax1p , a protein involved in expressing the bipolar budding pattern ; other parts of both proteins appear to be important for their delivery to the cells’ surface and poles . Moreover , it was found that transport of Bud8p and Bud9p to the cell poles via the secretory pathway is likely to occur independently of secretion pathway component Sec18p . The achieved mass of data may explain the fact that the bipolar budding pattern is established after some cell division cycles . Furthermore , they allow an appropriate refinement of the model on polarity establishment in S . cerevisiae . V Zusammenfassung Polarität stellt eine fundamentale zelluläre Eigenschaft von Lebewesen dar und ist eine Grundvoraussetzung für Orientierung und Überleben innerhalb einer mehrdimensionalen Umgebung . In dem eukaryotischen Modellorganismus Saccharomyces cerevisiae , der Bier - bzw . Bäckerhefe , wird Polarität im Rahmen der Zellteilung dann offensichtlich , wenn die Sprossung an einer bestimmten Stelle der Mutterzelle zur Abschnürung der Tochterzelle erfolgen soll . Dabei folgt die Sprossung in verschiedenen Zellformen nach genetisch determinierten Mustern : haploide a - bzw . α - Zellen sprossen nach einem axialen Sprossmuster , bei dem sowohl die Mutter - als auch die Tochterzelle die Sprossung vorwiegend am proximalen Zellpol beginnen ; diploide a / α - Zellen der Hefeform sprossen nach einem bipolaren Muster , bei dem die Sprossung mit gleicher Wahrscheinlichkeit am proximalen oder distalen Zellpol beginnt . Eine Vielzahl von Genen bzw . deren Produkte sind zur Ausbildung derartiger Sprossmuster in S . cerevisiae notwendig . Einem aktuellen Modell zufolge dirigieren spezifische Markerproteine das Modul einer Polaritäts - Signaltransduktionskaskade zum Sprosspol , mit dem Ergebnis , dass Komponenten des Zytoskeletts dorthin ausgerichtet werden , um die Ausbildung des Tochtersprosses zu veranlassen . Vorangegangene Arbeiten hatten die Genprodukte Bud8p und Bud9p als räumliche Marker und Polaritätsdeterminanten charakterisiert , ohne jedoch genauere Erkenntnisse bzgl . deren Funktion und Rolle innerhalb der Polaritätsetablierung in Hefe zu liefern . Die in dieser Arbeit präsentierten Ergebnisse beschreiben neben Co - Lokalisierungsstudien eine detaillierte Struktur - Funktionsanalyse von mutanten Bud8 - bzw . Bud9 - Proteinen ; im Ergebnis wurden hierbei distinkte Bereiche der jeweiligen Primärstruktur identifiziert , die zur Funktion , d . h . der Vermittlung des korrekten Sprossmusters , zur Lokalisierung oder für die Interaktion mit bestimmten Komponenten des als ' Polarisom ' bezeichneten Signaltransduktionsmoduls notwendig sind . Bestimmte Regionen spielen vermutlich eine Funktion bei der Interaktion mit Bud5p , einer Komponenten des GTPase - Signalmoduls , und mit Rax1p , einem Protein , das an der Ausbildung des bipolaren Sprossmusters beteiligt ist ; andere Bereiche beider Proteine scheinen für die Freisetzung an der Zelloberfläche und an den Zellpolen wichtig zu sein . Darüber hinaus konnte festgestellt werden , dass der Transport von Bud8p und Bud9p durch den sekretorischen Weg zu den Zellpolen unabhängig von der Sec18p - Komponente des Sekretionsappararates zu sein scheint . Die erzielten Ergebnisse könnten eine Erklärung bieten , warum das bipolare Sprossmuster erst nach einigen Zyklen der Zellteilung etabliert ist . Sie erlauben außerdem die Verfeinerung des Modells zur Polaritätsvermittlung in S . cerevisiae . 1 1 . Introduction 1 . 1 Definition and Importance of Cell Polarity The polarization of a cell structure along a defined axis at a specific time point is an important event in the lives of many cell types ( Chant and Pringle , 1991 ) . In general , cell polarity is most simply defined as an asymmetric distribution of specific proteins , nucleic acids , macromolecular assemblies , and organelles near a defined spatial site , thereby allowing the expansion of the surface in an asymmetrical or polar fashion . This process is fundamentally important for differentiation , proliferation , morphogenesis , and function of unicellular and multicellular organisms . Prokaryotic as well as eukaryotic cells respond to extracellular and intracellular signals to direct asymmetric cell growth and cell division ( Madden and Snyder , 1998 ) . Polarized cell growth involves asymmetric growth from a distinct region of a cell to form specific cell structures and shapes . These structures play a key role for the function of different cell types and often mediate diverse cellular interactions during development . Examples of cellular processes that rely on the formation of polarized cell structures are nutrient absorption by the microvilli of epithelial cells ( Mooseker , 1985 ) , plant fertilization ( Bedinger et al . , 1994 ) , or the interaction of helper T cells with antigen - presenting B cells ( Kupfer et al . , 1986 , Madden and Snyder , 1998 ) . Directional cell division is a process in which cells divide along specific cleavage planes . It occurs during the life cycle of many organisms , for instance during early embryogenesis in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans ( Hyman and White , 1987 ) , neurogenesis in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster ( Kraut et al . , 1996 ) , spore development in Bacillus subtilis ( Shapiro , 1993 ) , or development of the snail body plan ( Freeman and Lundelius , 1982 ) . In the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe , cell polarization plays an important role in cell division and the mating process ( Bähler and Peter , 2000 ) . However , the mechanisms for selecting sites of polarized growth and division as well as for directing growth toward these sites are only beginning to be understood ( Madden and Snyder , 1998 ) . As one of the best - characterized eukaryotic organisms , the budding yeast S . cerevisiae has become an excellent model system that is appropriate to study the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity . Basic biological research in this organism has contributed to get I NTRODUCTION 2 a first insight into the framework of genes and their products that control cell polarity , among them many regulatory and cytoskeletal components . However , a number of proteins linked to cell polarity have been identified whose mechanism of action is not well understood and that have to be investigated in forthcoming works . The aim of this introductory chapter is to summarize recent advances on the molecular machinery that controls establishment and maintenance of cell polarity in S . cerevisiae . 1 . 2 Polarization in Yeast The baker ' s yeast S . cerevisiae undergoes polarized growth during several stages of its life cycle , and growth occurs at defined positions on the cell surface ( Madden and Snyder , 1998 ) . Cells become highly polarized during three different phases ( Figure 1 ) : In the presence of ample nutrients , yeast grows by budding and exhibit polarized cell growth during this phase . The position where the bud forms ultimately determines the plane of cell division , and this location of the bud site depends on the mating type and pedigree of the cell ( Freifelder , 1960 ; Chant and Pringle , 1995 ) . During the late G1 stage , a bud emerges from a mother cell and continues to grow , first at the bud tip and then throughout the bud , until late nuclear division and cytokinesis occur ( Lew and Reed , 1993 ) . A second form of polarized growth in yeast occurs when the access to nitrogen is limited . Under these conditions diploid yeast cells switch from their yeast form ( YF ) to so - called pseudohyphal ( PH ) growth and cell morphology is altered from ellipsoidal - shaped yeast - form cells to long , thin pseudohyphal cells . Furthermore , pseudohyphae exhibit invasive growth behavior resulting in direct substrate invasion . Moreover , cell separation switches from complete to incomplete scission leading to multicellular growth where cells remain attached to each other ( Gimeno et al . , 1992 ; Kron et al . , 1994 ) . A related response occurs in haploids , termed haploid invasive growth , in which daughter cells bud to form chains of cells that penetrate an agar medium ( Roberts and Fink , 1994 ) . It is known that specific mechanisms exist to ensure that defined sites for growth are used during budding and the pseudohyphal response ( Madden and Snyder , 1998 ) . A third form of polarized growth occurs in yeast during the mating response . Haploid yeasts are of two kinds of cell types , either MAT a or MAT α . After exposure to pheromone from cells of the opposite mating type , cells arrest in late G1 and form an elongated mating projection ( Cross et al . , 1988 ; Sprague and Thorner , 1992 ) . Growth usually occurs at a cell surface location that is nearest to the mating partner ( Madden and Snyder , I NTRODUCTION 3 1992 ) . Thus , in contrast to bud site selection , in which defined sites for growth are used , external factors influence the selection of sites for polarized growth during mating . Figure 1 : Polarization in yeast . Three phases of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae life cycle exhibit polarized cell growth . Cells grown in a rich medium are round or oval and have defined budding patterns that depend on the mating type . Under nitrogen starvation conditions cells elongate and bud from the distal end to form pseudohyphae . Haploid cells exposed to pheromone from cells of the opposite mating type arrest in G1 and extend a projection towards their mating partner . Although vegetative growth , pseudohyphal growth , and mating response are distinct cellular processes , in each instance the cellular organization is very similar ( Madden et al . , 1992 ) . Virtually all aspects of cell polarization derive from polarization of the actin cytoskeleton , which is organized primarily into cortical patches and actin cables ( Chant , 1999 ; Pruyne and Bretscher , 2000a ) . Actin directs secretion to the bud tip ( in YF or PH cells ) or a mating projection to enable the cell to grow selectively at this region . During both processes , budding and mating , actin patches cluster at the tip of the yeast cell . In case of budding , these patches accumulate around regions of cell surface growth and may serve as docking site for vesicles or , in case of mating , as endocytosis sites for membrane retrieval . Strikingly , the actin patches display a rapid movement ( Doyle and Botstein , 1996 ; Waddle et al . , 1996 ) , presumably powered by myosin molecules that are associated with the patches ( Belmont and Drubin , 1998 ) . Probably , actin cables that emanate from the bud site or mating projection tip serve as tracks for myosin - directed movement of vesicles and organelles to the growth site . At the end of each budding or mating process , cortical cables and actin patches redistribute I NTRODUCTION 4 randomly in the mother and daughter cell or diploid zygote , respectively , until repolarization occurs during the next budding or mating event . The establishment of polarity can be divided into three different steps , which are independent of the cell type and the budding pattern ( Fig . 2 ) . The formation of a polarized axis is unfold in temporal sequence and can be distinguished genetically . In a first step , the cell integrates relevant information to choose a direction for polarization . Budding yeast cells use spatial landmark proteins to produce precise patterns of polarization , from which bud formation and cell division follows . Mating cells polarize in the direction of their mating partner , which is defined by gradients of secreted peptide mating pheromones . In a second step , an axis is build in that the pursued direction is recognized by a series of further proteins that are collectively called polarity establishment proteins or actin - organizing complex . In a last step , the polarity establishment proteins recruit the machinery required to organize and polymerize the actin cytoskeleton . Fig . 2 : Basic steps of polarity establishment in yeast . The establishment of polarity can be divided into three different steps . ( 1 ) Establishment of cell polarity requires a spatial site ( landmark ) on the cell cortex towards cells will polarize ; the position of this site can be defined genetically or in response to internal and external signals . ( 2 ) Once a site of polarization has been chosen , this landmark recruits a number of proteins , collectively termed polarity establishment proteins or actin - organizing components . ( 3 ) The polarity establishment proteins eventually recruit the machinery required to organize and polymerize actin patches and actin cables . I NTRODUCTION 5 1 . 3 Genetic Control of Bud Site Selection in Saccharomyces cerevisiae 1 . 3 . 1 Budding in cell - type - specific patterns Although S . cerevisiae is a unicellular organism , it can grow in form of different specialized cell types , which play distinctive and important roles in its life cycle . Two of the specialized cell types are haploid a and α cells , which mate with nearly 100 % efficiency with each other when placed adjacent to each other ( Herskowitz , 1988 ) . The result of this mating process , in which cells and nuclei fuse , is a diploid cell . This zygote has a distinctive shape and is able to produce diploid daughter cells of the usual shape by budding . The diploid a / α cell formed by mating is the third kind of specialized cell : this cell type is unable to mate with a or α cells , but it is capable of undergoing meiosis under conditions of nutritional starvation . A result from a single meiosis is the formation of four haploid spores that are wrapped up together in the ascus ( Herskowitz , 1988 ) . When diploid cells are limited for nitrogen , they are also able to switch to a multicellular growth form where S . cerevisiae grows as linear filaments of pseudohyphal cells ( Kron et al . , 1994 ) . The precise selection of budding sites appears to be of great importance for free - living yeasts , because yeast cells have maintained highly regulated control mechanisms of budding patterns that depend on the cell type and environmental conditions ( Fig . 3 ) . They divide in precise spatial patterns ( Freifelder et al . , 1960 ; Hicks et al . , 1977 ; Chant and Pringle , 1995 ; Chant , 1999 ) : Haploid a or α cells divide in an axial pattern , in which the mother and daughter cell are constrained to form their buds immediately adjacent to the previous site of cell separation ; diploid a / α YF cells divide in a bipolar pattern , where buds form either at the proximal pole ( that corresponds to the birth site ) or at the site opposite to it , called the distal pole ; upon nitrogen starvation , diploid cells that have switched to growth as pseudohyphal filaments preferentially bud in a unipolar distal pattern , where most of the buds emerge at the distal cell pole ( Gimeno et al . 1992 ; Kron et al . , 1994 ) . I NTRODUCTION 6 Fig . 3 : Bud site selection patterns of different yeast cell types . Haploid a and α cells preferentially form buds in an axial pattern at the proximal pole , which corresponds to the birth site . Diploid a / α yeast form ( YF ) cells bud in a bipolar pattern , where buds are formed either at the proximal pole ( that corresponds to the birth site ) or at the site opposite to it , called the distal pole . Upon nitrogen starvation , diploid pseudohyphal ( PH ) cells bud in a unipolar distal pattern , where most buds emerge at the distal cell pole . 1 . 3 . 2 Choosing a direction for polarization : orienting axes for budding Genetic analyses have revealed that selection of cell division sites is regulated by at least three different classes of genes and corresponding proteins ( Madden and Snyder , 1998 ; Chant , 1999 ) . The first class of genes is required for axial , bipolar and unipolar distal budding . This class includes RSR1 / BUD1 , BUD2 , and BUD5 ( Bender and Pringle , 1989 ; Chant and Herskowitz , 1991 ; Chant et al . , 1991 ) , and mutations in any of these genes cause random budding patterns in haploid and diploid cells . The corresponding gene products ( Rsr1p / Bud1p , Bud2p , and Bud5p ) constitute a GTPase signaling module that is assumed to assist in directing bud formation components to the selected site of growth . A second class is specifically required for the axial pattern of haploid cells without affecting the bipolar pattern of diploids . This class comprises the genes AXL1 , AXL2 / BUD10 , BUD3 , and BUD4 ( Chant and Herskowitz , 1991 ; Fujita et al . , 1994 ; Roemer et al . , 1996 ; Halme et al . , 1996 ) . The products of these genes are involved in marking the mother - bud neck during one cell cycle as a site for budding in the next cell cycle . A third class is required for the bipolar budding pattern of diploid cells but not for haploid axial budding . Genetic screens have identified many genes corresponding to this class , including AIP3 / BUD6 , BUD7 , BUD8 , BUD9 , BNI1 , PEA2 , and SPA2 ( Snyder , 1989 ; Valtz and Herskowitz , 1996 ; Zahner et al . , 1996 ) . Mutations in most of these genes cause random budding specifically in diploid cells without affecting axial budding in haploids . Only two genes of this class , BUD8 and BUD9 , have been I NTRODUCTION 7 described to shift the budding pattern from a bipolar pattern to a unipolar pattern and therefore appear to exhibit the most specific effects on bipolar budding . Mutations in BUD8 cause a unipolar proximal budding pattern in diploids , whereas bud9 mutants bud with a high frequency from the distal cell pole ( Zahner et al . , 1996 ) . Therefore , Bud8p and Bud9p have been proposed to act as bipolar landmarks that might recruit components of the common budding factors , e . g . Bud2p , Bud5p , or Rsr1p / Bud1p , to either one of the cell poles ( Chant , 1999 ) . 1 . 3 . 3 General polarity genes As outlined above , RSR1 / BUD1 , BUD2 , and BUD5 belong to a class of genes that are important for axial budding , bipolar budding as well as for unipolar distal budding . The corresponding proteins Rsr1p / Bud1p , Bud2p , and Bud5p constitute a GTPase signaling module , which is thought to help direct bud formation components to the selected site of growth . Mutations in one of these genes lead to randomization of the budding patterns in haploid and diploid cells but no other obvious morphological phenotypes ( Bender and Pringle , 1989 ; Chant et al . , 1991 ; Chant and Herskowitz , 1991 ; Park et al . , 1993 ) . RSR1 / BUD1 encodes a Ras - related GTPase , whereas preceding experiments indicate that BUD2 and BUD5 encode a GTPase - activating protein ( GAP ) ( Bender , 1993 ; Park et al . , 1993 ) and a guanine - nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) ( Chant et al . , 1991 ; Powers et al . , 1991 ; Zheng et al . , 1995 ) for the Rsr1p / Bud1p GTPase , respectively . It is predicted that the activity of either Bud2p or Bud5p at the future bud site might regulate Rsr1p / Bud1p and hence mediate proper bud site selection ( Madden and Snyder 1998 ) . Presumably , the Rsr1p / Bud1p GTPase signaling module directs bud formation components to cortical landmark proteins at future bud sites ( Chant et al . , 1991 ; Chant and Herskowitz , 1991 ; Herskowitz et al . , 1995 ; Michelitch and Chant , 1996 ; Park et al . , 1993 ) . This hypothesis is consistent with the results of a previous study , which stated that Bud5p plays a key role in linking a spatial signal to polarity establishment ( Kang et al . , 2001 ) . It was shown that Bud5p physically interacts with the axial landmark protein Axl2p / Bud10p . Recently , also a direct physical link between Bud5p and Bud8p could be established ( Kang et al . , 2004a ) . Further genetic analyses suggest an interaction between the Rsr1p / Bud1p GTPase module and the polarity - establishment components Cdc42p , Cdc24p , and Bem1p . Cdc42p is a I NTRODUCTION 8 Rac / Rho - type GTPase ( Johnson and Pringle , 1990 ) , whose activity is regulated by the GEF Cdc24p ( Zheng et al . , 1995 ) . Bem1p is an SH3 - domain protein and functions as a scaffold protein that binds Cdc24p and Cdc42p ( Leeuw et al . , 1995 ) . All these proteins are involved in the establishment of yeast cell polarity , but up to the present , the mechanism by which the GTPase module and the polarity establishment components interact with the cortical tags is not known . 1 . 3 . 4 Genes required for the axial budding pattern Cells exhibiting an axial budding pattern utilize a cytokinesis tag in which a component at the cytokinesis site persists into the next cell cycle and directs formation of a new bud at an adjacent site ( Madden and Snyder , 1998 ) . Presumably , this tag functions as template for directing assembly of bud formation components at the selected site growth ( Chant and Herskowitz , 1991 ; Madden et al . , 1992 ; Snyder et al . , 1991 ) . Different yeast septin proteins such as Cdc3p , Cdc10p , Cdc11 , and Cdc12p ( Chant et al . , 1995 Flescher et al . , 1993 ) as well as Bud3p ( Chant and Herskowitz , 1991 ; Chant et al . , 1995 ) , Bud4p ( Chant and Herskowitz , 1991 ; Sanders and Herskowitz , 1996 ) , and Axl2p / Bud10p ( Halme et al . , 1996 ; Roemer et al . , 1996 ) may be components of this tag . Genetic studies led to identification of four proteins specifically required for axial budding : Bud3p , Bud4p , Axl1p , and Axl2p / Bud10p . Loss of any of these four proteins results in a bipolar budding pattern ( Adames et al . , 1995 ; Fujita et al . , 1994 ; Sanders and Herskowitz , 1996 ) . Bud3p and Bud4p were identified in a screen for mutants that are characterized to be defective in bud site selection ( Chant and Herskowitz , 1991 ) . The predicted Bud3p sequence is somewhat uninformative ( Chant , 1999 ) , whereas Bud4p contains a potential GTP - binding motif near its carboxy terminus . Both proteins could be localized as double rings encircling the mother - bud neck during mitosis , a pattern that is similar to that of the septins . Previous studies also exhibited that localization of Bud3p and Bud4p is dependent on the neck filament - associated proteins Cdc3p , Cdc4p , Cdc11p , and Cdc12p ( Chant et al . , 1995 ; Sanders and Herskowitz , 1996 ) . Conversely , there is no evidence for septin localization requiring Bud3p and Bud4p . These observations indicate that Bud3p and Bud4p assemble at the septin complex and that they help select cortical sites for axial budding ( Madden and Snyder , 1998 ) . I NTRODUCTION 9 AXL2 / BUD10 encodes a single - spanning integral membrane glycoprotein , which is required for axial budding in haploid cells ( Halme et al . , 1996 ; Roemer et al . , 1996 ) . The protein consists of a 300 amino acid ( aa ) intracellular domain and a 500 aa extracellular domain ( Halme et al . , 1996 ; Roemer et al . , 1996 ) , which is highly O - glycosylated by the mannosyltransferase Pmt4p ( Sanders et al . , 1999 ) . The localization pattern of Axl2p / Bud10p resembles that of many proteins involved in polarized growth as it localizes as a patch at the incipient bud site and at the bud periphery of small - budded cells ( Roemer et al . , 1996 ) . Moreover , Axl2p / Bud10p is also present in form of a ring at the bud neck in medium - and large - budded cells ( Halme et al . , 1996 , Roemer et al . , 1996 ) , which is similar to the localization pattern of the putative neck filament proteins , Bud3p and Bud4p . The exact mechanism by which Axl2p / Bud10p participates in choosing the bud site is not yet known . Currently , it is assumed that there are two possibilities how Axl2p / Bud10p might function in axial bud site selection ( Halme et al . , 1996 , Roemer et al . , 1996 ) . One possibility is that Axl2p / Bud10p functions together with the septin proteins Bud3p and / or Bud4p as part of the cytokinesis tag , which marks the site of cell division and recruits other proteins required for the establishment of polarized growth ( Halme et al . , 1996 , Roemer et al . , 1996 ) ; another possibility is that Axl2p / Bud10p is involved in tag recognition ( Roemer et al . , 1996 ) . Coincident with the hypothesis that Axl2p / Bud10p plays a role in tag recognition are observations that it localizes to the incipient bud site and that the axl2 Δ / bud10 Δ mutant strains contain ' droopy ' buds , a phenotype suggestive of a role in the early steps of the bud formation ( Roemer et al . , 1996 ; Madden and Snyder , 1998 ) . A further convincing reason for the involvement of the protein in tag recognition is the fact that Axl2p / Bud10p physically interacts with Bud5p , which is part of the GTPase signaling module ( Kang et al . , 2001 ) . A fourth gene that plays a role in axial bud site selection is AXL1 ( Adames et al . , 1995 ; Fujita et al . , 1994 ) . This gene encodes a haploid - specific endoprotease , which performs one of two NH 2 - terminal cleavages during maturation of the a - factor mating pheromone . However , the protease activity is not required for axial bud site selection ( Adames et al . , 1995 ; Chen et al . , 1997 ; Fujita et al . , 1994 ; Lord et al . , 2002 ) . AXL1 is particularly interesting , because its expression is specific to haploid cells ( Adames et al . , 1995 ; Fujita et al . , 1994 ) . Furthermore , artificial high - level expression of AXL1 in diploid cells promotes axial budding ( Fujita et al . , 1994 ) . However , this result must be interpreted cautiously , because AXL1 was highly overexpressed and only a modest , twofold increase in budding at I NTRODUCTION 10 the proximal pole was observed . Nevertheless , Axl1p is a candidate for a haploid - specific gene product that specifies axial budding in haploid cells ( Madden and Snyder , 1998 ) . At least two further genes , KRE9 and HKR1 , are important for axial bud site selection . The gene product of KRE9 encodes a glycoprotein that is involved in cell wall ( 1 → 6 ) β - glucan assembly , whereas Hkr1p is a serine / threonine - rich cell surface protein that plays a role in the regulation of cell wall ( 1 → 3 ) β - glucan biosynthesis ( Brown and Bussey , 1993 ; Yabe et al . , 1996 ) . Deletion of either KRE9 or HKR1 leads to an increase of budding events at random sites . There are two possibilities how the proteins might participate in the axial bud site selection : On the one hand , the mutations might affect either the localization or the function of a cortical tag like Axl2p / Bud10p , which has an extracellular domain , or , on the other hand , the mutations might disturb underlying cytoskeletal components to disrupt bud site selection . Thus , a combination of different proteins – intracellular cortical proteins , transmembrane proteins , and extracellular proteins – appears to be crucial for axial bud site selection in yeast ( Madden and Snyder , 1998 ) . 1 . 3 . 5 Genes required for the bipolar budding pattern The bipolar budding pattern is more complex than axial budding in haploid cells . Generally , daughter cells bud at the distal pole , whereas mother cells choose either the proximal or the distal pole . A lot of genes have been identified in previous studies that are important for the establishment and maintenance of the bipolar budding pattern in diploid cells . However , much less is known about the molecular mechanisms by which proximal and distal sites are selected . A model according to Madden and Snyder ( 1998 ) is ' ' that ' growth and polarity ' components deposited at the cell surface during early bud formation and growth can serve as cortical tags for selecting distal sites in daughters . ' ' Another group of proteins localized at the neck region during cytokinesis might be involved in selecting proximal sites ( Chant and Herskowitz , 1991 ; Chant et al . , 1995 ; Snyder et al . , 1991 ; Zahner et al . , 1996 ) . As for the axial budding process in haploids , recognition of these components is thought to require the Rsr1p GTPase module . 1 . 3 . 5 . 1 The actin cytoskeleton and actin - binding proteins The actin cytoskeleton and actin - binding proteins play an important role in the bipolar budding process . The yeast actin cytoskeleton consists of two filament - based structures : the I NTRODUCTION 11 actin cortical patches and the actin cables ( Adams and Pringle , 1984 ; Kilmartin and Adams , 1984 ) , which are both assembled from monomers encoded by the ACT1 gene . The actin cytoskeleton is essential for different processes , and , therefore , it is not astonishing that the actin cortical patches show a polarized distribution that changes during the cell cycle . First , actin localizes at the incipient bud , suggesting a role in bud emergence . Soon thereafter it is also found within the growing bud , indicating a role in bud growth . Late in the cell cycle the actin cortical patches reorganize into two rings in the neck , where they are believed to be involved in septation and cytokinesis . A number of mutations in the ACT1 gene that affect the bipolar budding in diploid cells have been identified ( Drubin et al . , 1993 ; Yang et al . , 1997 ) . Strikingly , these mutations only affect the budding pattern of diploid mother cells , which bud more and more randomly with each cell division . Interestingly , ACT1 mutations do not influence the budding pattern of daughter cells and additionally have little or no effect on axial budding in haploid cells ( Madden and Snyder , 1998 ) . In further experiments , a distinct region on the actin protein was found that is thought to recognize bipolar - specific proteins or cues ( Kabsch et al . , 1990 ; Wertman et al . , 1992 ; Yang et al . , 1997 ) . It should be noted that mutations in several genes would shift the bipolar pattern to a random pattern without affecting the axial pattern . One such group includes several genes encoding actin - associated proteins ( e . g . Sac6p , Srv2p , Sla2p , Rvs167p ) , another contains genes whose gene products disrupt actin organization ( e . g . Sla1p , Rvs161p ) . All mutations cause defects that are similar to those of act1 mutations ( Adams et al . , 1991 ; Amberg et al . , 1995 ; Bauer et al . , 1993 ; Crouzet et al . , 1991 ; Drubin , 1990 ; Drubin et al . , 1988 ; Freeman et al . , 1996 ; Holtzman et al . , 1993 ; McCann and Craig , 1997 ; Sivadon et al . , 1997 ; Vojtek et al . , 1991 ; Zhao et al . , 1995 ) . It seems unlikely that all these gene products have a direct mechanistic role in bipolar budding , so most , if not all , of these genes are expected to affect the actin cytoskeleton or the secretory pathway ( Chant , 1999 ) . Although most actin - associated proteins are apparently not important for distal budding of diploid cells , there is one exception : Bni1p . This protein belongs to the highly conserved formin protein family that can be found in S . cerevisiae ( Evangelista et al . , 1997 ) , S . pombe ( Chang et al . , 1997 , Petersen et al . , 1995 ) , mouse ( Mass et al . , 1990 ) , and Drosophila ( Castrillon and Wasserman , 1994 ; Emmons et al . , 1995 ) . It could be demonstrated that Bni1p interacts with regulators of the actin cytoskeleton such as Cdc42p or profilin I NTRODUCTION 12 ( Evangelista et al . , 1997 ) . Mutations in the BNI1 gene become obvious only in diploid strains , which are characterized by a randomized budding pattern in the first and in subsequent divisions , whereas haploid bni1 Δ strains exhibit a quite normal budding ( Zahner et al . , 1996 ) . Therefore , it is assumed that Bni1p might also be involved in the establishment of the distal tag in diploid daughter cells beside its function in bipolar budding of mother cells ( Madden and Snyder , 1998 ) . 1 . 3 . 5 . 2 Additional proteins participating in diploid bud site selection Beside actin and actin - associated proteins , a variety of further components have been identified that also play a role in bipolar budding . It is evident that some of these proteins may also regulate the actin cytoskeleton . Spa2p , Pea2p , and Aip3p / Bud6p belong to a class of proteins , which are important for bipolar bud site selection ( Amberg et al . , 1997 ; Snyder , 1989 ; Valtz and Herskowitz , 1996 ; Zahner et al . , 1996 ) . Effects of mutations in SPA2 , PEA2 , and AIP3 / BUD6 are similar to act1 mutations : selection of distal bud sites in diploid daughter cells is not affected , but the number of cells which choose random sites during budding increases with the number of successive cell divisions . A current model is that Spa2p , Pea2p , Aip3p / Bud6p , and Bni1p form a multiprotein complex - the 12S polarisome - that helps to concentrate the actin cytoskeleton and / or exocytic vesicles at growth sites ( Sheu et al . , 1998 ) . This idea is consistent with several observations : First , Spa2p , Pea2p , Aip3p / Bud6p , and Bni1p are able to interact with one another ( Fujiwara et al . , 1998 ; Sheu et al . , 1998 ) ; second , Spa2p , Pea2p , Aip3p / Bud6p , and Bni1p co - localize at the tips of buds and mating projections ( Amberg et al . , 1997 ; Evangelista et al . , 1997 ; Gehrung and Snyder , 1990 ; Snyder , 1989 ; Snyder et al . , 1991 ; Valtz and Herskowitz , 1996 ) ; and third , the examination of distribution of the polarized secretion marker Sec4p demonstrates that spa2 Δ , pea2 Δ , aip3 Δ / bud6 Δ , or bni1 Δ mutant strains fail to concentrate Sec4p at the bud tip during apical growth and at the division site during repolarization just prior to cytokinesis ( Sheu et al . , 1998 ) . Therefore , it is likely that the 12S polarisome comprising Spa2p , Pea2p , Aip3p / Bud6p , and Bni1p concentrates components of the actin cytoskeleton and secretory vesicles at growth sites during growth and separation ( Sheu et al . , 1998 ) . Two further proteins that appear to be implicated in the bipolar budding are Rax1p and Rax2p ( Kang et al . , 2004b ) . The gene product that is encoded by RAX2 is suggested to be an integral membrane protein with type I orientation . Rax1p also appears to be an integral I NTRODUCTION 13 membrane protein but a detailed characterization of this protein requires considerable further investigations . Both genes , RAX1 and RAX2 , were originally identified in a mutant screen in which an axl1 strain , which buds in the bipolar budding pattern , was mutagenized and examined for isolates defective for the bipolar budding pattern ( Chen et al . , 2000 ; Fujita et al . , 1994 ) . However , it became clear that this phenotype reflects the involvement of Rax1p and Rax2p in bipolar rather than in axial budding . Further examinations of the mutant phenotypes then revealed that rax1 and rax2 mutations do not influence the axial budding of haploid cells but that they disrupt bipolar budding of diploids ( Chen et al . , 2000 ; Kang et al . , 2004b ; Ni and Snyder , 2001 ) . It could be shown that both proteins play a role in selecting bud sites at both the distal and the proximal poles of daughter cells as well as near previously used division sites on mother cells ( Kang et al . , 2004b ) . Careful analysis suggests that Rax1p and Rax2p function together in helping to mark the sites that are thought to possess landmarks used in bipolar budding ( Chant and Pringle , 1995 ) . Several additional observations are consistent with this model ( Kang et al . , 2004b ) . First , Rax1p and Rax2p localize interdependently at the tips of buds and the distal poles of daughter cells as well as at the division site on both mother and daughter cell . Localization to the division site was persistent through multiple cell cycles . Second , in co - purification experiments it was shown that Rax1p interacts with both Bud8p at the bud tip and the distal pole and with Bud9p at the proximal pole . Because of the existing association between Rax1p and Rax2p an interaction between Rax1p and the potential marker proteins Bud8p and Bud9p can be assumed . In additional experiments , it was also found that the localization of Rax1p and Rax2p to the bud tip and the distal pole depends on the presence of Bud8p , whereas a normal localization of Bud8p is only partially dependent on Rax1p and Rax2p . Although localization of Rax1p and Rax2p to the division site did not appear to depend on Bud9p , normal localization of the proximal pole marker appeared largely or entirely dependent on Rax1p and Rax2p ( Kang et al . , 2004b ) . Taken together , these data indicate that Rax1p and Rax2p interact closely with each other and with the landmark proteins Bud8p and Bud9p in the establishment and / or maintenance of the cortical landmarks for bipolar budding . The genes SUR4 , FEN1 , and BUD7 encode additional proteins required for the bipolar budding . SUR4 and FEN1 code for homologous and functionally redundant proteins ( Revardel et al . , 1995 ) . Unfortunately , less is known about these proteins . To date , it is known that mutations in SUR4 and FEN1 cause randomization of the bipolar budding pattern . This I NTRODUCTION 14 defect has not been analyzed in detail but suggests the involvement of the proteins in the bipolar budding process ( Durrens et al . , 1995 ; Revardel et al . , 1995 ) . A mutation in BUD7 causes heterogeneous defects in bipolar budding : in contrast to a normal budding , the a / α cells produce chains of bud sites starting at the distal pole or the equatorial region , as well as the proximal pole ( Zahner et al . , 1996 ) ; a null allele of BUD7 has not been reported . Further studies with respect to SUR4 , FEN1 , and BUD7 may provide additional insights into mechanisms for recognition of sites during bipolar budding of diploid yeast cells ( Madden and Snyder , 1998 ) . 1 . 3 . 5 . 3 The role of Ste20p and the diploid - specific landmark proteins Bud8p and Bud9p Beside the proteins described above , three further components - Bud8p , Bud9p , and Ste20p - play essential roles in the bipolar budding process . Deletions of the corresponding genes cause a unipolar budding pattern in diploid cells ( Sheu et al . , 2000 ; Taheri et al . , 2000 ; Zahner et al . , 1996 ) . STE20 encodes a signal transducting kinase of the PAK ( p21 - activated kinase ) family . It could be demonstrated by Sheu et al . ( 2000 ) that Ste20p is involved in both apical growth and bipolar bud site selection . Disruption of the gene results in cell elongation defects and shortens the apical growth phase . Furthermore , mutations in STE20 result in a unipolar budding pattern with bud scars clustered adjacent to the birth scar , at the proximal pole ( Sheu et al . , 2000 ) . This budding pattern is identical to that of diploid bud8 Δ mutants and ste20 Δ bud8 Δ double mutants . The observation of this phenotype indicates that Ste20p and Bud8p , which is proposed as cortical tag at the distal cell pole , function in the same pathway to promote budding at the distal pole . In addition , it has been shown that Ste20p and Bud8p interact in the yeast two - hybrid system ( Drees et al . , 2001 ) . However , the exact function of Ste20p could not be clarified in detail . It is supposed that Ste20p might be involved in phosphorylating the potential distal tag Bud8p in addition to its role in apical growth . Another hypothesis according to Sheu et al . ( 2000 ) is that Bud8p may function in apical growth like Ste20p . More information about Ste20p is given below ( see chapter 1 . 3 . 7 ) . The bipolar budding pattern of diploid cells appears to depend on persistent spatial markers in the cortex at the two poles of the cell . Previous analysis of mutants that affect the bipolar budding pattern of diploid cells but not the axial pattern of haploids identified two interesting candidates , BUD8 and BUD9 . Corresponding gene products potentially represent I NTRODUCTION 15 components of markers at the poles distal and proximal to the birth scar , respectively , a hypothesis that is supported by further studies . Mutations in BUD8 and BUD9 have been described to shift the bipolar to a unipolar budding pattern with bias to either the distal or the proximal pole . Thus , BUD8 and BUD9 appear to have the most specific effects on bipolar budding ( Mösch and Fink , 1997 ; Taheri et al . , 2000 ; Zahner et al . , 1996 ) . Diploid bud8 Δ / bud8 Δ mutant strains bud predominantly at the proximal pole , whereas bud9 Δ / bud9 Δ mutants choose the distal pole for budding ( Chant , 1999 ; Harkins et al . , 2001 ; Taheri et al . , 2000 ) . Strains lacking both genes exhibit a randomization of their budding pattern with bud scars being scattered all over the cell surface . This phenotype suggests that the bipolar budding pathway has been totally disabled . Furthermore , it could be shown that the expression of these genes at high levels can cause either an increased bias for budding at the distal ( BUD8 ) or the proximal ( BUD9 ) pole or a randomization of the bud position , depending on the level of expression ( Harkins et al . , 2001 ) . The biochemical properties and localizations of Bud8p and Bud9p are consistent with their postulated roles as cortical landmark proteins . Both proteins appear to be integral membrane proteins of the plasma membrane . The overall structures of Bud8p and Bud9p are similar in that both are predicted to consist of a large NH 2 - terminal extracellular domain that is highly N - and O - glycosylated followed by a pair of putative membrane - spanning domains , surrounding a short loop which is presumably cytoplasmic , and a very short extracellular domain at the COOH - terminus ( Chant , 1999 ; Harkins et al . , 2001 ; Taheri et al . , 2000 ) . The putative transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the two proteins are very similar in sequence , suggesting that these parts of Bud8p and Bud9p might be important for the recruitment of the common budding factors , e . g . Rsr1p / Bud1p , Bud2p , and Bud5p , which are necessary to transmit the positional information from ( the axial and bipolar ) cortical markers to the proteins responsible for cell polarization ( Chant , 1999 ; Harkins et al . , 2001 ; Pringle et al . , 1995 ; Taheri et al . , 2000 ) . When Bud8p and Bud9p are localized by fluorescence microscopy , each protein can be found at the expected location : Bud8p appears to localize primarily to the presumptive bud site , the distal pole of the bud , and the distal pole of daughter cells ( Harkins et al . , 2001 ; Taheri et al . , 2000 ) . Bud9p localizes at the presumptive bud site , the bud tip of growing daughter cells , as well as the mother - daughter neck region , apparently the proximal pole of the daughter cell ( Harkins et al . , 2001 ) . Because Bud9p is also found at the distal pole and I NTRODUCTION 16 physically interacts with Bud8p , it might fulfil an additional function at the this pole where it seems to act as a nutritionally controlled inhibitor of distal budding ( Fig . 4 ; Taheri et al . , 2000 ) . Further examinations concerning the localization of both proteins exhibited that the delivery of Bud8p is dependent on actin , whereas the delivery of Bud9p is dependent on actin and septin ( Harkins et al . , 2001 ; Schenkman et al . , 2002 ) . Fig . 4 : Model for regulation of bud site selection at the distal cell pole of S . cerevisiae . In yeast form ( YF ) cells , Bud9p is localized at the distal cell pole and interferes with Bud8p - mediated bud site selection via the Rsr1p / Bud1p - Bud5p - Bud2p GTPase module . In pseudohyphal ( PH ) cells , nutritional starvation for nitrogen prevents distal localization of Bud9p , allowing efficient Bud8p - mediated distal budding . Previous data indicate that the transcription of BUD8 and BUD9 is cell cycle - regulated . Examinations of Bud8p by fluorescence microscopy suggests that the protein is delivered to the nascent bud site shortly before or coincident with bud emergence , whereas Bud9p appears to be delivered to the neck very late in the cell cycle just before cytokinesis I NTRODUCTION 17 ( Schenkman et al . , 2002 ) . In general agreement with the assumption that the delivery of Bud8p and Bud9p appears to be under different cell cycle control , further experiments exhibited that the BUD8 mRNA peaks in G2 / M , whereas BUD9 mRNA peaks in late G1 . These results were surprising in that each mRNA peaked long before the corresponding protein appears to be delivered to the cell surface ( Schenkman et al . , 2002 ) . The timing of gene expression seems to be the primary determinant of Bud8p and Bud9p localization and function : when Bud8p is expressed from the BUD9 promoter , it localizes if it were Bud9p and appears fully competent to provide Bud9p ( but not Bud8p ) function . Moreover , when Bud9p is expressed from the BUD8 promoter , it localizes as if it was Bud8p and is unable to provide Bud9p function ; however , the protein at the distal pole is only partially effective in providing Bud8p function . Thus , features of the Bud8p polypeptide itself are likely to be important for its efficient delivery , stability , and / or function at the distal cell pole ( Schenkman et al . , 2002 ) . Although genetic and cell biological analyses have led to the identification of a large number of components that constitute the bud site selection pathway in diploid yeast cells , the molecular functions of both Bud8p and Bud9p are poorly understood . For instance , distinct domains that are important for a correct function and polar localization of these potential landmark proteins are not known . 1 . 3 . 6 Genes required for the unipolar distal budding In response to nitrogen starvation , diploid yeast cells are able to switch their bipolar budding pattern to a unipolar distal one , where most of the buds emerge at the distal cell pole . This unipolar distal budding program is required for the establishment of filamentous structures and therefore can be viewed as a process that is regulated by nutritional signals to guide the direction of the growing pseudohyphal filaments ( Mösch , 2002 ) . Therefore , pseudohyphal development is an optimal model to study factors that determine oriented cell division in response to external signals . However , the molecular mechanisms that control this change in cell polarity are only little understood , because most studies have addressed the function of genes controlling bud site selection under nutrient - rich conditions where S . cerevisiae will grow and divide as single yeast form cells . Only a few studies have aimed at identification of genes required for the unipolar distal pattern of the pseudohyphal growth form . To date , no class of genes has been identified that is specifically required for the unipolar distal of PH cells without affecting the bipolar budding of YF cells . An initial study I NTRODUCTION 18 has identified Rsr1p / Bud1p to be required for the pseudohyphal development , because expression in the dominant negative form of RSR1 / BUD1 , RSR1 Asn16 , suppresses filament formation in response to nitrogen starvation ( Gimeno et al . , 1992 ) . This suggestion is confirmed by data from another study that showed that strains lacking RSR1 / BUD1 are not able to undergo filamentous growth ( Taheri et al . , 2000 ) . A genetic screen directed at the identification of genes specifically required for pseudohyphal development has revealed several genes that are actually known to be important for bipolar bud site selection , e . g . BUD8 , BNI1 , PEA2 , and SPA2 ( Mösch and Fink , 1997 ) . These findings suggest that the pseudohyphal polarity switch might be achieved by alteration of components that control the bipolar budding process ( Mösch , 2002 ) . 1 . 3 . 7 The role of polarity establishment components A set of proteins that are critical for bud formation in yeast are the polarity establishment proteins . These include Cdc42p , a GTPase most closely related to members of the Rho family , and its GEF , Cdc24p ( Adams et al . , 1990 ; Sloat et al . , 1981 ; Zheng et al . , 1994 ) . Cells containing temperature - sensitive mutations in either of these genes fail to form buds and form large , round , unbudded cells with multiple nuclei ( Adams et al . , 1990 ; Field and Schekman , 1980 ; Sloat and Pringle , 1978 ; Sloat et al . , 1981 ) . At restrictive temperature , these strains fail to localize many polarized components important for yeast budding properly , including Spa2p , actin patches , and septins ( Adams and Pringle , 1984 ; Adams et al . , 1990 ; Johnson and Pringle , 1990 ; Snyder et al . , 1991 ; Ziman et al . , 1991 ) . In localization studies Cdc42p was detected at polarized sites of growth , whereas Cdc24p , its GEF , localizes over the entire cell periphery ( Pringle et al . , 1995 ) . Therefore , either Cdc24p functions only at polarized growth sites where Cdc42p accumulates or it has additional targets besides Cdc42p ( Madden and Snyder , 1998 ) . Published data from Zheng et al . ( 1993 ) suggest that Cdc24p regulates the activity of Cdc42p . In mammalian cells , Cdc42p interacts with the PAK protein kinase to help mediating cell polarization ( Manser et al . , 1994 ; Martin et al . , 1995 ) . Yeast cells contain three PAK kinase homologs , Ste20p ( see chapter 1 . 3 . 5 . 3 ) , Cla4p , and Skm1p ( Cvrcková et al . , 1995 ; Martin et al . , 1997 ) . Strains containing either ste20 Δ or cla4 Δ or skm1 Δ are viable and do not exhibit any apparent defects ( Cvrcková et al . , 1995 ; Martin et al . , 1997 ) . Interestingly , ste20 Δ cla4 Δ double mutant strains are not viable indicating that the functions between these two I NTRODUCTION 19 kinases overlap ( Cvrcková et al . , 1995 ) . Combinations between the skm1 Δ mutation with either ste20 Δ or cla4 Δ produced no detectable phenotype indicating that Skm1p is not redundant with Ste20p or Cla4p ( Martin et al . , 1997 ) , but the exact function of Skm1p is not known . Further studies revealed that Ste20p and Cla4p interact physically with Cdc42p and that this association is important for the function ( s ) of these proteins ( Cvrcková et al . , 1995 , Leberer et al . , 1997 ; Peter et al . , 1996 ; Simon et al . , 1995 ) . Another protein that helps to establish and maintain polarity in yeast is Bni1p . Bni1p is a member of the highly conserved formin protein family found in S . cerevisiae ( Evangelista et al . , 1997 ) , S . pombe ( Chang et al . , 1997 ; Petersen et al . , 1995 ) , mouse ( Torres et al . , 1991 ) , and Drosophila ( Castrillon and Wasserman , 1994 ; Emmons et al . , 1995 ) . Bni1p associated with actin in two - hybrid assays and with regulators of the actin cytoskeleton ( Cdc42p ) and its effectors ( Ste20p and Cla4p ) in co - immunoprecipitation or in vitro binding experiments ( Evangelista et al . , 1997 ) . Diploid bni1 Δ mutant strains bud randomly both in the first division and in subsequent division ( Zahner et al . , 1996 ) , but bni1 Δ haploid cells bud normally . Thus , Bni1p might play an important role in the establishment of the distal tag in diploid daughter cells . Other components that genetically interact with Cdc42p and Cdc24p have been identified . These include Bem3p , a Rho - GAP homolog that serves as a GTPase activating protein for Cdc42p in vitro ( Stevenson et al . , 1995 ; Zheng et al . , 1993 ; Zheng et al . , 1994 ) . Rga1p and Rga2p , two Rho - GAP homologs , serve as GAPs for Cdc42p in vivo ( Stevenson et al . , 1995 ) . Moreover , both proteins are involved in control of septin organization , pheromone response , and haploid invasive growth ( Smith et al . , 2002 ) . Zds1p and Zds2p appear to down - regulate Cdc42p in vivo ( Bi and Pringle , 1996 ) . Mutations in another polarity establishment protein , BEM1 , are co - lethal with MSB1 , a high - copy suppressor of both cdc24 and cdc42 ( Bender and Pringle , 1991 ) . Bem1p is an SH3 - domain protein that physically interacts with Cdc24p , Ste5p , and Ste20p ( Leeuw et al . , 1995 ) . It could be shown that this protein strongly facilitates bud emergence , possibly as a scaffold to assist the clustering of Cdc24p - Cdc42p ( Pruyne and Bretscher , 2000a ) . Finally , two potential targets of Cdc42p , Gic1p and Gic2p , have been described recently ; Gic1p and Gic2p interact genetically with Cdc42p and contain a CRIB domain , which is characteristic of many Cdc42p - interacting proteins ( Brown et al . , 1997 ; Chen et al . , 1997 ) . Bem1p , Gic1p , Gic2p , Zds1p , and Zds2p are all important for cell polarity in yeast , and each of these proteins except Zds2p is localized to sites of polarized cell I NTRODUCTION 20 growth , similar to Cdc42p ( Bi and Pringle , 1996 ; Brown et al . , 1997 ; Chen et al . , 1997 ; Pringle et al . , 1995 ) . 1 . 3 . 8 A model for choosing bud sites in the axial and bipolar pattern Both haploid and diploid yeast cells use spatial cues for producing the axial or bipolar budding pattern . In case of haploid cells , Bud10p is assumed to function as marker protein for the axial budding process ( Fig . 5 ) . The extracellular domain of Bud10p is highly glycosylated and may serve to anchor the protein in the cell wall . Besides Bud10p , septins , Bud3p , and Bud4p are also part of the so - called cytokinesis tag , and the tight clustering between these proteins presumably helps to generate a potent signal ( Roemer et al . , 1996 ; Halme et al . , 1996 ) . Kang et al . ( 2001 ) could show that Bud10p directly interacts with Bud5p , which is a component of the Bud1p GTPase signaling module . Local activation of the Bud1p GTPase in turn activates the Cdc42p GTPase , which leads to recruitment of other proteins required for establishment of polarized growth . Diploid yeast cells use spatial cues for producing the bipolar pattern that are entirely distinct from those used in the axial pattern ( Chant , 1999 ) . In diploids , Bud8p and Bud9p were proposed to function as bipolar landmarks at the distal and proximal pole , respectively ( Fig . 5 ) . As described before , sequence analyses on Bud8p and Bud9p predict related transmembrane proteins that are highly glycosylated ( Harkins et al . , 2000 ) . A physical interaction between Bud8p and Bud5p was shown by Kang et al . ( 2004a ) , an association between Bud9p and Bud5p is demonstrated in this work . It is supposed that the same components needed for polarity establishment in haploids are involved in further signal transduction that finally leads to recruitment of components essential for polarized growth . I NTRODUCTION 21 Fig . 5 : Molecular machinery guiding the axes of polarization during budding . Both haploid and diploid yeast cells use spatial cues for producing the axial and bipolar budding pattern , respectively . In haploid yeast cells , Bud10p functions as spatial landmark protein for axial budding . In diploids , Bud8p and Bud9p fulfill a function as distal and proximal pole marker , respectively . These markers interact with Bud5p , a component of the Bud1p GTPase signaling module . Local activation of the Bud1p GTPase in turn activates the Cdc42p GTPase , which leads to recruitment of other proteins required for establishment of polarized growth . I NTRODUCTION 22 1 . 4 Aim of this Work Although genetic and cell biological analysis has led to the identification of a large number of components that constitute the bud site selection pathway in diploid yeast cells , the molecular function of the involved factors is poorly understood in many cases . Within the scope of this work , it was intended to better characterize individual components that play a role in the process of bud site selection in yeast . The potential landmark proteins Bud8p and Bud9p are objects of peculiar interest . It is known that both Bud8p and Bud9p localize to the distal and the proximal pole , respectively , to fulfill their function as landmarks in the bipolar budding process of diploid cells . In former studies concerning the localization of Bud8p and Bud9p , the proteins were each investigated separately . To get a better insight in appearance of the landmark proteins , one purpose of this study should be the realization of co - localization experiments enabling the detection of both Bud8p and Bud9p within the same cell . As described in above , the overall structure of Bud8p and Bud9p is similar in that both proteins are predicted to consist of a large NH 2 - terminal extracellular domain , followed by a membrane - spanning domain ( TM1 ) , a short cytoplasmic loop , a second membrane - spanning domain ( TM2 ) , and a very short extracellular domain at the COOH - terminus . The NH 2 - terminal portion of both proteins contains several N - and O - glycosylation sites that appear to be functional . However , characterization of distinct domains of the landmark proteins that are required for , e . g . , correct function of the proteins , transport of the proteins to the cell poles , or that confer interaction with other proteins or downstream components of the budding machinery are not known . To answer this these questions , a systemic analysis of Bud8p and Bud9p should be carried out to better understand the structure and the function of the bipolar landmark proteins . Furthermore , deletion sets resulting from systemic analysis of Bud8p and Bud9p should be used to investigate the existing association between Bud8p and Bud9p and their interaction partners Bud5p and Rax1p via co - immunoprecipitation experiments . In a last approach , investigations should be carried out to get more information on the intracellular transport of Bud8p and Bud9p to the yeast cell poles . Therefore , tagged versions of both proteins should be investigated by ' pulse - chase ' experiments , which should allow predictions about secretion of the proteins via the secretory pathway and their half - life periods within the cell . 23 2 .

CFP and YFP coding sequences ( carried by BHUM393 and BHUM394 ) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) as Bgl II - fragments using the oligonucleotides AO - FP - 2 - 1 and AO - FP - 2 - 2 . In a following step , pME1771 ( BUD8prom - GFP UV - BUD8 in pRS316 ) was digested with Bgl II to remove GFP UV - coding sequence and replace it by a CFP or a YFP fragment . The obtained constructs were checked by restriction analysis . DNA sequencing using the ABI Prism Big Dye terminator sequencing kit and an ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer ( A PPLIED B IOSYSTEMS , Weiterstadt , D ) confirmed correct sequence and correct orientation of the CFP and YFP fragments . Since co - localization experiments presuppose usage of a 2 µ m vector containing a cassette encoding a LEU2 selection marker , the obtained CFP - BUD8 and YFP - BUD8 coding sequences from the previous step were cloned in pRS425 ( Christianson et al . , 1992 ) yielding the plasmids BHUM941 and BHUM942 . BHUM943 ( pRS426 ( 2 µ m , URA3 ) , CFP - BUD8 ) and BHUM944 ( pRS426 ( 2 µ m , URA3 ) , YFP - BUD8 ) , which were necessary for expression analysis , were constructed in a similar way as described for BHUM941 and BHUM942 . The generation of Bud9p variants fused to CFP and YFP was carried out analogously . CFP and YFP encoding sequences ( carried by BHUM393 and BHUM394 ) were amplified by PCR as Bam HI fragments using the oligonucleotides AO - FP - 1 - 1 and AO - FP - 1 - 2 . Restriction analysis followed DNA sequencing confirmed sequence and correct orientation of CFP and YFP . The obtained CFP - and YFP - BUD9 constructs were each digested with proper enzymes and cloned into pRS426 yielding the plasmids BHUM951 and BHUM952 . 2 . 1 . 2 . 2 Construction of BUD8 and BUD9 deletion sets The set of myc 6 - BUD8 and myc 9 - BUD9 alleles carrying systematic deletions in their open reading frames was constructed by a PCR - based strategy involving several steps . To generate the strains YHUM842 - YHUM855 , fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a six - fold myc - tagged wild type version of BUD8 ( carried by BHUM498 ) as parts with differences in length . Six fragments were generated , comprising 924 bp of the upstream sequence and parts of the BUD8 open reading frame ( ORF ) , using the oligonucleotides T3 and BUD8DEL01 - BUD8DEL06 . All fragments of this group exhibit an inserted Bgl II restriction site at their 3 ' - end . Another six fragments , comprising parts of the BUD8 ORF and M ATERIALS AND M ETHODS 36 588 or 712 bp of the downstream sequence , were amplified using the primers BUD8DEL07 - BUD8DEL12 as well as BUD8X - 6 and BUD8DEL13 , respectively . Fragments of this group display inserted Bgl II sites at their 5 ' - end . The fragments of both groups were first digested with Not I / Bgl II and Bgl II / Xho I , respectively , and then subcloned into pBlueskript KS ( + / - ) . DNA sequencing using the ABI Prism Big Dye terminator sequencing kit ( T3 - I and T7 - I were used as primers ) and an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer ( A PPLIED B IOSYSTEMS , Weiterstadt , Germany ) confirmed that the fragments had been cloned . After verification selected fragments of both groups were joined together using the integrated Bgl II restriction site . The resulting BUD8 deletions were cloned as Not I - Xho I fragments into the plasmid pRS306 . The obtained plasmids BHUM782 - BHUM793 as well as a myc - tagged full - length version of BUD8 ( BHUM498 ) were linearized within URA3 by digestion with Stu I ( Eco 147I ) and integrated in the haploid a - and α - strains YHUM904 and YHUM861 . Successful integration of the constructs was confirmed by southern analysis . Haploid strains with corresponding constructs were combined to receive homozygous diploid strains for investigations . YHUM856 was constructed in a similar manner as described for the other BUD8 constructs . For joining of the two amplified fragments , a Xho I restriction site was introduced instead of a Bgl II site . Confirmation of the obtained plasmid BHUM794 as well as transformation and crossing of corresponding yeast strains were carried out essentially as described above . For construction of a BUD9 deletion set a plasmid carrying a three - fold myc - tagged wild type version ( BHUM795 ) was chosen as template . Seven fragments were generated that contain parts of the BUD9 ORF plus 944 bp upstream sequence . For their amplification the oligonucleotides BUD9X - 1 and BUD9DEL01 - BUD9DEL07 were used , which introduce a Spe I restriction site at the 5 ' - end and an Eco RI site at the 3 ' - end of the PCR products . Additionally , the complete BUD9 coding sequence plus 944 bp upstream sequence and 384 bp downstream sequence was amplified as Spe I - Xho I fragment with BUD9X - 1 and BUD9Y - 1 . After subcloning of all fragments and the entire BUD9 gene in pBlueskript KS ( + / - ) each myc 3 - epitope was replaced with a myc 9 - epitope that was cut out as Bgl II fragment from BHUM894 . Another seven fragments comprising parts of the BUD9 ORF and 384 bp of the downstream region were amplified as Eco RI - Xho I fragments using the oligonucleotides BUD9DEL08 - BUD9DEL14 and BUD9Y - 1 and then subcloned into pBlueskript KS ( + / - ) digested with Eco RI and Xho I . Sequencing confirmed the cloning of M ATERIALS AND M ETHODS 37 each PCR product and the correct orientation of the myc 9 - epitopes in the Spe I - Eco RI fragments and the full - length version of BUD9 . Distinct fragments were combined using the inserted Eco RI restriction site and then cloned as Spe I - Xho I fragment into pRS304 and pRS305 yielding the plasmids BHUM796 - BHUM823 . The haploid MAT a bud9 deletion strain BHUM994 was transformed with BHUM796 - BHUM809 after digestion within the TRP1 with Bst 1107I . BHUM810 - BHUM823 were linearized within the LEU2 locus with Bst EII and then integrated in the haploid MAT α deletion strain BHUM995 . Successful integration of each construct at the TRP1 and the LEU2 locus , respectively , was confirmed by southern blot analysis . Appropriate transformants were mated to obtain the homozygous bud9 deletion strains YHUM1009 - YHUM1022 . 2 . 1 . 2 . 3 Construction of Bud8p and Bud9p deletion constructs for Bud5p interaction studies For co - immunoprecipitation of myc 6 - tagged wild type versions of the landmark proteins Bud8p and Bud9p as well as selected deletion constructs of both proteins with a GST - fused version of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Bud5p , sequences coding for myc 6 - BUD8 and myc 9 - BUD9 had to be cloned into a vector that allows selection and expression of a pair of plasmids within the cell . Furthermore the proteins should be produced at high levels to ensure expression of adequate protein amounts for co - purification experiments . Since BUD5 encoding sequences are expressed from a vector containing a URA3 cassette , corresponding BUD8 and BUD9 variants were cloned into pRS425 , a vector carrying a LEU2 selection marker .

The obtained plasmids were termed as BHUM1016 to BHUM1026 . The myc 6 - BUD8 as well as the myc 6 - BUD8 Δ 513 - 600 versions already existed as constructs cloned into a high - copy - number plasmid with LEU2 selection marker ( BHUM532 and BHUM706 , respectively ) and were directly used for the interaction studies .

After incubating the gel with ' Amplify ' ( A MERSHAM P HARMACIA B IOTECH , Buckinghamshire , GB ) for 45 min the proteins were detected by exposing the gels to X - Omat AR ( E ASTMAN K ODAK C O . , Rochester , NY , USA ) at - 80°C . 2 . 2 . 9 Protein localization by GFP fluorescence microscopy Strains harbouring plasmids encoding GFP - Bud8p or GFP - Bud9p variants were individually grown to the mid - log phase in liquid YNB medium as described for bud scar staining . Cells from 1 ml of the cultures were harvested by centrifugation and immediately viewed in vivo on a Z EISS A XIOVERT microscope by either differential interference microscopy ( DIC ) or fluorescence microscopy using a GFP filter set ( AHF A NALYSENTECHNIK AG , Tübingen , Germany ) . Cells were photographed using a H AMAMATSU O RCA ER digital camera and the I MPROVISION O PENLAB software ( I MPROVISION , Coventry , UK ) . 2 . 2 . 10 Pseudohyphal growth assays Assays for pseudohyphal development were performed as described previously ( Mösch and Fink , 1997 ) . After three days of growth at solid SLAD medium , pseudohyphal colonies were viewed with a Z EISS A XIOLAB microscope and photographed using a digital camera DX30 and the Kappa Image Base Noah software ( K APPA O PTO - E LECTRONICS , Gleichen , Germany ) . 2 . 2 . 11 Bud scar staining and determination of budding patterns For characterization of budding patterns , bud scars and birth scars were visualized by fluorescence microscopy . Bud scar staining was performed on YF cells grown in to the exponential phase . Cells in the exponential phase were prepared by growing strains in liquid YPD medium at 30°C to an OD 600 of 0 . 6 and then collected by centrifugation in conical polystyrene tubes . To disperse clumps , cells of diploid strains were resuspended in 1 ml water and sonicated briefly . Cells of haploid strains had been sonicated more intensively . Suspensions were generally fixed at room temperature for 2 h in 3 . 7 % formaldehyde . Samples were rinsed twice in water and resuspended in 100 µ l of a fresh stock of 1 mg / ml calcofluor white ( Fluorescent Brightener 28 ; S IGMA , St . Louis , MO ) . After 10 min incubation with calcofluor solution samples were washed thrice and were then resuspended in water . Birth scars and bud scars were visualized by fluorescence microscopy using a Z EISS A XIOVERT microscope and photographed using H AMAMATSU O RCA ER digital camera and the M ATERIALS AND M ETHODS 49 I MPROVISION O PENLAB software ( I MPROVISION , Coventry , UK ) . Bud scar distribution of diploid cells was determined qualitatively and quantitatively . For qualitative analysis , cells with between 5 and 12 bud scars were divided in four classes : unipolar proximal , cells with ( nearly ) all bud scars at the proximal cell pole immediately adjacent to one another ; unipolar distal , cells with ( nearly ) all bud scars at the distal cell pole immediately adjacent to one another ; bipolar , cells with at least three bud scars at the distal cell pole and at least one bud scar at the proximal pole ; and random , cells with bud scar distribution other than bipolar or unipolar . For each experiment , the budding pattern was determined for 200 cells . For quantitative evaluation , the position of all bud scars was determined for 100 cells with one , two , three , and four bud scars . Positions of bud scars were scored as proximal cell pole ( the third of the cell centred on the birth scar ) , equatorial ( the middle third of the cell ) , or the distal pole ( the third of the cell most distal to the birth scar ) . Bud scar distribution of haploid cells was determined qualitatively . For each experiment , the budding pattern of 200 cells with more than 4 bud scars was determined and divided in three different classes : axial ( cells with bud scars immediately adjacent to the previous site of cell separation ) , bipolar , and random . 50 3 . Results 3 . 1 Co - localization of the cortical tag proteins Bud8p and Bud9p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae In accordance with their function as cortical tag proteins , Bud8p and Bud9p are localized at the cell poles of S . cerevisiae . Previous studies showed that Bud8p is localized at the distal pole of mother and daughter cells ( Taheri et al . , 2000 ; Harkins et al . , 2001 ; Schenkman et al . , 2002 ) . In contrast to this , Bud9p could be detected at the proximal pole ( Harkins et al . , 2001 ; Schenkman et al . , 2002 ; Kang et al . , 2004b ) as well as the distal pole ( Taheri et al . , 2000 ) . Former studies were carried out in vivo by using GFP fusion proteins and in situ by using myc - tagged versions of both proteins . Because in previous studies only one of each protein had been labelled , co - localization studies by labelling both proteins with different fluorescence markers were performed . For this purpose , Bud8p and Bud9p were fused to CFP ( cyan fluorescent protein ) and YFP ( yellow fluorescent protein ) . The obtained CFP and YFP fusion proteins are well - suited for the intended localization studies , because the different excitation ( CFP : 436 nm ; YFP : 514 nm ) and emission wavelengths ( CFP : 476 nm ; YFP : 527 nm ) of the fluorescence proteins ensure that either CFP or YFP is excited and consequently detected . 3 . 1 . 1 Expression of CFP and YFP fusion proteins in S . cerevisiae strains To investigate their localization , BUD8 and BUD9 were fused to CFP and YFP . In this way , four different constructs were obtained : BHUM941 ( CFP - BUD8 in pRS426 ) , BHUM942 ( YFP - BUD8 in pRS426 ) , BHUM951 ( CFP - BUD9 in pRS426 ) , and BHUM952 ( YFP - BUD9 in pRS426 ) . To study the expression of these constructs , BHUM943 and BHUM944 were transformed into the diploid bud8 Δ strain RH2449 . BHUM951 and BHUM952 were transformed into the diploid bud9 ∆ strain YHUM1049 . Expression of BUD8 and BUD9 constructs was determined by preparing total protein extracts from the obtained yeast strains and analysis by Western blot hybridization . Thus , equivalent amounts of each sample were subjected to SDS - PAGE , transferred to nitrocellulose , and probed with a polyclonal anti - GFP antibody ( α - GFP ) as primary antibody and a peroxidase - coupled anti - mouse antibody as secondary antibody . Bud8p fused to CFP and YFP , respectively , appeared reproducibly as pattern of multiple signals ( Fig . 6 ) . The lowest molecular form appeared around 85 kDa , and several bands of higher molecular weight could be observed around 180 kDa . Separation of R ESULTS 51 CFP - and YFP - Bud9p by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis typically led to appearance of double bands , whereof one could be observed in the range of 90 kDa and the other at a size of approximately 120 kDa ( Fig . 6 ) . The calculated molecular weight of each analyzed protein was lower than the observed one . Presumably , the appearance at a higher size than the predicted mass had been shown to result in part from glycosylation ( Harkins et al . , 2001 ) . Our findings suggest that the four fusion proteins consisting of BUD8 and BUD9 fused to either CFP or YFP were expressed in adequate amounts . Conclusively , neither the expression of BUD8 nor BUD9 was disturbed by fusion with CFP or YFP . Fig . 6 : Expression of Bud8p and Bud9p fusion proteins . Total protein extracts were prepared from a diploid bud8 Δ strain expressing CFP - BUD8 ( BHUM943 ) or YFP - BUD8 ( BHUM944 ) and a diploid bud9 Δ strain expressing CFP - BUD9 ( BHUM951 ) or YFP - BUD9 ( BHUM952 ) . Extracts were analyzed for expression of Bud8p and Bud9p fused to CFP or YFP by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal anti - GFP antibody ( α - GFP ) ( upper panel ) . As an internal control , the expression of Fus3p was measured using an anti - Fus3p antibody ( lower panel ) . Molecular size standards ( in kDa ) are indicated on the left hand side . 3 . 1 . 2 Bud8p and Bud9p fusion proteins are partially functional To study functionality of the Bud8p and Bud9p fusion proteins , their ability to confer bipolar budding in diploid yeast strains was investigated ( Fig . 7 ) . For this purpose , a diploid bud8 ∆ strain ( RH2449 ) expressing either CFP - BUD8 or YFP - BUD8 and a diploid bud9 ∆ strain ( YHUM993 ) carrying CFP - BUD9 and YFP - BUD9 were used . Furthermore , a diploid bud8 ∆ bud9 ∆ double mutant strain ( RH2453 ) expressing CFP - BUD8 in combination with YFP - BUD9 or vice versa was examined . Also all strains , RH2449 , BYHUM993 , as well as RH2453 , carrying no plasmids were used as reference strains . As additional controls , a diploid bud1 ∆ strain ( RH2448 ) and a diploid wild type strain ( RH2495 ) were inspected . Bud scars of cells growing in the yeast form ( YF ) to the exponential phase were stained with calcofluor , and budding patterns were determined by quantitative evaluation of the position of the first four bud scars as well as by determination of the final budding pattern of cells with four to twelve bud scars . R ESULTS 52 Fig . 7 : Early budding patterns in yeast strains expressing CFP - and YFP - fusion proteins . Exponentially growing cultures from yeast strains expressing CFP - and YFP - fusion proteins were stained with calcofluor to evaluate the bud scar distribution by fluorescence imaging of cells . Following strains were investigated : ( A ) RH2495 ( wild type ) , ( B ) RH2449 ( bud8 Δ / bud8 Δ ) , ( C ) YHUM993 ( bud9 Δ / bud9 Δ ) , ( D ) RH2453 ( diploid bud8 Δ bud9 Δ ) , ( E ) RH2448 ( bud1 Δ ) , ( F , G ) RH2449 transformed with BHUM943 ( CFP - BUD8 ) and BHUM944 ( YFP - BUD8 ) , respectively , ( H , I ) YHUM993 transformed with BHUM951 ( CFP - BUD9 ) and BHUM952 ( YFP - BUD9 ) , respectively , and ( J , K ) RH2453 transformed with BHUM943 / BHUM952 or BHUM944 / BHUM951 . For each strain , the positions of all bud scars were determined for 100 cells with one bud scar ( representing in total 100 bud scars per bar ) , 100 cells with two bud scars ( representing 200 bud scars per bar ) , 100 cells with three bud scars ( representing 300 bud scars per bar ) , and 100 cells with four bud scars ( representing 400 bud scars per bar ) . Bud scars were scored as proximal ( the third comprising the birth end of the cell ) , equatorial ( the middle third of the cell located between proximal and distal cell pole ) , or distal ( the third that is at the opposite to the birth scar ) . Bars represent the percentage of cells at the proximal , the equatorial , and the distal region . For each strain the average value from two independent experiments is shown . R ESULTS 53 The analysis of the bud position of the first four bud scars showed that wild type yeast cells produce the first bud scar nearly always at the distal cell pole of the mother cell . The first bud scar at the proximal pole appeared soonest after formation of the third daughter cell . Mutant strains carrying a BUD8 deletion bud almost exclusively from the proximal pole , whereas the absence of BUD9 typically leads to a unipolar distal budding pattern ( Zahner et al . , 1996 ) . Strains with null mutations in both genes , BUD8 and BUD9 , firstly also bud almost exclusively from the proximal pole ( Zahner et al . , 1996 ) . In the course of further budding events , bud scars are scattered increasingly all over the cell surface . A bud1 ∆ strain displayed randomization of the budding pattern in combination with an increased frequency of budding events in the middle of the cell between the proximal and the distal cell pole . In case of the yeast strain carrying a BUD8 deletion , the budding pattern defect could be rescued when such a strain was transformed with plasmids expressing CFP - BUD8 and YFP - BUD8 , respectively . In both cases , the transformants displayed bipolar budding . The same was true for a diploid bud9 ∆ strain . Transformation of this strain with CFP - or YFP - BUD9 led to nearly normal bipolar budding . Nevertheless , the amount of bud scars in the middle of the cell was slightly increased , which might be due to the fact that high copy number plasmids were used . Re - establishment of bipolar budding in bud8 ∆ bud9 ∆ double mutants was successful when a corresponding strain ( RH2453 ) was transformed with plasmids containing CFP - BUD8 and YFP - BUD9 , respectively . Similarly , expression of YFP - BUD8 and CFP - BUD9 in bud8 Δ bud9 Δ mutants principally re - established bipolar budding , although a higher percentage of cells were observed that select the proximal pole during the first or second division . Thus , the CFP - Bud8p , YFP - Bud8p , CFP - Bud9p , and YFP - Bud9p proteins appear to be functional , although with strongly reduced activity . The partial rescue of bud8 Δ bud9 Δ mutants by expression of both Bud8p and Bud9p fusion proteins might further be present due to overexpression of both proteins . The results obtained with quantitative evaluation of the initial first four bud scars correlated with the further investigation of the final budding pattern ( Fig . 8 ) . This analysis showed that wild type cells typically bud in a bipolar budding pattern , where newborn daughter cells emerge from the proximal and the distal pole in a 1 : 1 distribution . As found in former studies , bud8 ∆ strains formed daughter cells with a high frequency at the proximal cell pole , and strains lacking BUD9 exhibit a unipolar distal budding pattern . Strains , which are R ESULTS 54 not able to produce neither Bud8p nor Bud9p , are characterized by a randomization of bud site selection similar to bud1 ∆ strains . Expression of fluorescent variants of Bud8p and Bud9p led to re - establishment of the bipolar pattern , although a higher proportion of random budding was observed when compared to a control strain . Fig . 8 : Late budding pattern of yeast strains expressing CFP - and YFP - fusion proteins . Cells described in Fig . 7 were exponentially grown and stained with calcofluor . For qualitative evaluation of the budding pattern , cells with 5 to 12 bud scars were analyzed and divided in following classes : ' unipolar proximal ' for cells with most bud scars at the proximal cell pole ; ' unipolar distal ' for cells with most bud scars at the distal cell pole immediately adjacent to one another ; ' bipolar ' for cells with at least three bud scars at the distal pole and at least one bud scar at the proximal pole ; ' random ' for cells with bud scar distribution other than unipolar or bipolar . For each strain and experiment at least 200 cells were analyzed . R ESULTS 55 Similar effects on the budding pattern were observed when bud8 ∆ bud9 ∆ double mutant strains expressed both fusion proteins ( CFP - Bud8p together with YFP - Bud9p or YFP - Bud8p together with CFP - Bud9p ) at high levels . Although bipolar budding was observed in 40 - 60 % of the cells , more than 40 % of the investigated cells displayed a random budding pattern . This effect is more pronounced in strains that express YFP - Bud8p in combination with CFP - Bud9p than in strains synthesizing CFP - Bud8p and YFP - Bud9p . Thus , although expression of fluorescent fusions of Bud8p and Bud9p does not completely rescue the budding defects of bud8 Δ bud9 Δ mutants , these proteins appear to be suitable for co - localization studies . 3 . 1 . 3 Co - localization of Bud8p and Bud9p using CFP - and YFP - fusion proteins For co - localization studies BUD8 and BUD9 fused to CFP or YFP were each transformed into the haploid bud8 Δ bud9 Δ strains YHUM1050 ( MAT α , bud8 Δ : : HIS3 , bud9 Δ : : HIS3 , ura3 - 52 , his3 : : hisG , leu2 : : hisG ) and YHUM1051 ( MAT a , bud8 Δ : : HIS3 , bud9 Δ : : HIS3 , ura3 - 52 , his3 : : hisG , leu2 : : hisG , trp1 : : hisG ) , respectively . Four strains were obtained , which were crossed in a way that diploid strains were generated expressing either CFP - Bud8p in combination with YFP - Bud9p or YFP - Bud8p in combination with CFP - Bud9p . To localize fusion proteins , cultures of these diploid strains were grown in YNB medium to the exponential phase . Investigation of the proteins was done by microscopic visualization using a suited filter set for CFP and YFP , respectively . The investigation of CFP - and YFP - Bud8p under the fluorescence microscope revealed that the proteins could be detected in unbudded cells as distinct signal at one of the both cell poles , presumably the distal pole ( Fig . 9 ) . In parallel , Bud9p fused to CFP or YFP could be detected as tiny spot at both poles ( Fig . 9 ) . Once cells begin to form a bud , Bud8p is localized asymmetrically at the site of the budding event . In rare cases ( approximately 10 % of all unbudded cells with a detectable signal ) , an additional signal could be observed at the site opposite of that , where the daughter cell emerged . We suggest that these signals might be unspecific aggregations because of the overexpression of the proteins within the cell . At this stage , Bud9p could be detected partly as a distinct signal at the bud tip . With increasing size of the daughter cell , localization patterns of Bud8p and Bud9p were maintained : Bud8p was still localized as an asymmetrical signal at the bud site of the mother cell and as crescent - like R ESULTS 56 structure at the emerging daughter cell , and Bud9p remained as tiny dot at the distal cell pole of the bud tip . Fig . 9 : Co - localization of CFP and YFP fusion proteins with Bud8p and Bud9p . Images show localization patters of CFP - and YFP - fused Bud8p and Bud9p proteins as visualized by CFP or YFP filter sets , respectively . Different stages of the cell cycle are shown : cells without a bud ( 1 & 2 ) , with a small ( 3 & 4 ) , middle - sized ( 5 & 6 ) , or large ( 7 & 8 ) bud ; cells were observed and photographed by Nomarski filter ( DIC ) or fluorescent microscopy ( CFP / YFP ) . ( 1 - 5 ) bud8 Δ bud9 Δ + CFP - BUD8 / YFP - BUD9 ; ( 6 - 8 ) bud8 Δ bud9 Δ + YFP - BUD8 / CFP - BUD9 . In summary , these co - localization studies support that Bud8p and Bud9p function as marker at the distal and proximal cell pole , respectively . Bud8p is primarily detected at the distal pole , whereas Bud9p is found at both poles , substantiating the hypothesis that Bud9p does not only play a role as proximal pole marker but also as negative regulator of Bud8p at the distal pole . R ESULTS 57 3 . 2 Characterization of domains of landmark proteins Bud8p and Bud9p 3 . 2 . 1 Generation of Bud8p and Bud9p deletion sets The exact mechanism , by which the potential landmark proteins Bud8p and Bud9p regulate site - specific initiation of cell division , is not known . The overall structures of Bud8p and Bud9p are similar in that both are predicted to consist of a large NH 2 - terminal extracellular domain , followed by a membrane - spanning domain ( TM1 ) , a short cytoplasmic loop , a second membrane - spanning domain ( TM2 ) , and a very short extracellular domain at the COOH - terminus ( Chant , 1999 ; Harkins et al . , 2001 ; Taheri et al . , 2000 ) ( Fig . 10 ) . The NH 2 - terminal portion of both proteins contains several N - and O - glycosylation sites that appear to be functional ( Harkins et al . , 2001 ) . Fig . 10 : Domain structures of Bud8p and Bud9p . Proteins are shown as bars from the NH 2 - to the COOH - terminus with ruler on top numbering the position of amino acid residues . TM1 and TM2 indicate the positions of the two transmembrane domains . To identify regions necessary for proper function and localization of Bud8p and Bud9p , deletion sets of both proteins were constructed . Generally , deletions were chosen in a way by which the deleted parts overlap . Furthermore , all proteins were tagged with myc - epitopes for detection by immunoblotting . In the case of BUD8 , twelve deletion variants were generated . Constructs expressing deletion proteins were transformed into the haploid a - strain YHUM904 and the α - strain YHUM861 . Strains with corresponding constructs were combined to receive diploid strains for investigations . In the case of BUD9 , thirteen deletion constructs were established . These deletion constructs were transformed into the haploid a - strain YHUM994 and the α - strain YHUM995 . Diploid strains were received by crossing of corresponding a - and α - strains . R ESULTS 58 To measure expression of the different Bud8p and Bud9p deletion variants , total protein extracts from corresponding diploid yeast strains were prepared and analyzed by Western blot analysis using monoclonal anti - myc antibodies . The expression of both proteins in endogenous amounts resulted in strong signals , which could be clearly visualized ( Fig . 11 & Fig . 12 ) . A wild - type strain expressing non - tagged full - length Bud8p and Bud9p proteins was used as control and does not display any signals . In case of Bud8p , all epitope - tagged mutant proteins produced specific and detectable signals when corresponding yeast strains were analyzed by Western blot analysis . The myc 6 - tagged full - length protein from BUD8 ( with a calculated mass of 75 kDa ) reproducibly appeared as multiple signal - pattern when separated in a 10 % SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( Fig . 11 ) . The lowest molecular form appeared around 85 kDa , and several bands of a higher molecular weight could be observed between 130 kDa and 140 kDa . Appearance of Bud8p at a size higher than the calculated molecular weight was shown to result in part from glycosylation ( Harkins et al . , 2001 ) . Ten out of the twelve Bud8p mutant proteins also produced multiple bands , with one band appearing in the range of the calculated molecular weight and with further bands appearing at a higher size . In contrast , the two mutant proteins Bud8p Δ 375 - 417 and Bud8p Δ 375 - 505 produced only a single band , with Bud8p Δ 375 - 417 appearing in the range of the calculated size and Bud8p Δ 375 - 505 appearing at a size higher than the predicted . Essentially similar results were obtained in case of epitope - tagged myc 9 - Bud9p ( Fig . 12 ) . The calculated weight of this polypeptide is 75 kDa . Expression of myc 9 - Bud9p resulted in multiple signals where the lowest signal appeared around 80 kDa and further diverse bands around 110 and 130 kDa . The appearance of the Bud9p polypeptide at higher molecular levels than the predicted one reflects the glycosylation of the protein as found in case of Bud8p ( Harkins et al . , 2001 ) . R ESULTS 59 Fig . 11 : Expression levels of Bud8p variants . Total protein extracts were prepared from strains expressing non - tagged BUD8 ( RH2495 , control ) , myc 6 - BUD8 ( YHUM842 , BUD8 ) , and myc 6 - BUD8 mutant alleles ( YHUM843 , Δ 7 - 53 ; YHUM844 , Δ 7 - 114 ; YHUM847 , Δ 74 - 114 ; YHUM848 , Δ 74 - 216 ; YHUM849 , Δ 173 - 216 ; YHUM850 , Δ 173 - 325 ; YHUM851 , Δ 268 - 325 ; YHUM852 , Δ 268 - 417 ; YHUM853 , Δ 375 - 417 ; YHUM854 , Δ 375 - 505 ; YHUM855 , Δ 468 - 505 ; YHUM856 , Δ 513 - 600 ) . Extracts were analyzed for expression of myc - epitope tagged proteins by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal anti - myc antibody ( α - myc ) . As an internal control , the expression of Cdc42p was measured using an anti - Cdc42p antibody ( lower panel ) . Molecular size standards ( in kDa ) are shown on the left hand side . Fig . 12 : Expression levels of Bud9p variants . Total protein extracts were prepared from a reference strain carrying the wild type allele of BUD9 ( RH2495 ) , a strain carrying a myc 9 - BUD9 allele ( YHUM1009 , BUD9 ) as well as strains expressing the epitope - tagged BUD9 mutant alleles ( YHUM1010 , Δ 8 - 48 ; YHUM1011 , Δ 8 - 130 ; YHUM1012 , Δ 91 - 130 ; YHUM1013 , Δ 91 - 218 ; YHUM1014 , Δ 168 - 218 ; YHUM1015 , Δ 168 - 283 ; YHUM1016 , Δ 244 - 283 ; YHUM1017 , Δ 244 - 369 ; YHUM1018 , Δ 323 - 369 ; YHUM1019 , Δ 323 - 450 ; YHUM1020 , Δ 406 - 450 ; YHUM1021 , Δ 406 - 544 ; YHUM1022 , 460 - 544 ) . Equivalent amounts of each sample were subjected to SDS - PAGE , transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with a monoclonal anti - myc antibody ( α - myc ) . As an internal control , protein levels of Cdc42p were measured in the same extracts using a polyclonal anti - Cdc42p antibody ( α - Cdc42p ) ; molecular size standards ( in kDa ) are shown on the left hand side . R ESULTS 60 3 . 2 . 2 Functionality and localization of Bud8p and Bud9p mutant proteins 3 . 2 . 2 . 1 Bipolar budding of diploid strains To test the functionality of Bud8p and Bud9p deletion proteins , the budding patterns produced by corresponding mutant strains were determined by staining bud scars with calcofluor and early ( first four ) and late ( cells with 5 to 12 bud scars ) bud site selection patterns ( Fig . 13 & Fig . 14 ; Table 4 ) were analyzed . As previously shown , diploid bud8 Δ / bud8 Δ deletion strains elaborated a unipolar proximal budding pattern ( Harkins et al . , 2001 ; Taheri et al . , 2000 ) . A strain expressing the myc 6 - tagged full - length version of BUD8 was phenotypically indistinguishable from a strain expressing the non - tagged BUD8 wild type gene in that both produced a bipolar budding pattern in YF cells ( Fig . 13 ) . The analysis of the BUD8 mutants revealed three different phenotypic classes . A first class included four mutants ( BUD8 Δ 7 - 53 , BUD8 Δ 7 - 114 , BUD8 Δ 74 - 114 , and BUD8 Δ 468 - 505 ) establishing a bipolar budding pattern like a wild - type strain or a strain expressing a six fold myc - tagged wild - type version of BUD8 ( Fig . 13 ) . Evaluation of the bud positions of the first four bud scars revealed that three strains expressing either BUD8 Δ 7 - 53 , BUD8 Δ 7 - 114 or BUD8 Δ 74 - 114 , formed their first and second bud scars almost exclusively at the distal cell pole ( Fig . 14 ) . This pattern is also characteristic for the wild - type strain . The fourth mutant of this class expresses the BUD8 Δ 468 - 505 allele , coding for one variant of Bud8p lacking a segment that is situated close to the first of two putative transmembrane domains at the C - terminus . However , the bipolar budding pattern of this strain is not identical to the wild type pattern , because the amount of cells with a random budding is slightly enhanced . Analysis of the early budding pattern revealed that the BUD8 Δ 468 - 505 mutant strain formed bud scars at both cell poles with almost equal frequency already during the first rounds of cell division of newborn cells , whereas the initial bud scars of a control strain emerged predominantly from the distal pole . The second class included four mutants , which expressed the BUD8 Δ 74 - 216 , BUD8 Δ 375 - 417 , BUD8 Δ 375 - 505 , or BUD8 Δ 513 - 600 alleles . All of these strains selected the proximal pole for budding with a frequency that is similar to strains in which BUD8 is completely deleted ( Fig . 13 and Fig . 14 ) . These mutants define two segments of Bud8p , one residing in the NH 2 - terminal portion and the other being located at the COOH - terminal part , that appear to be indispensable for functionality of the protein . R ESULTS 61 A third class included the strains expressing BUD8 Δ 173 - 216 , BUD8 Δ 173 - 325 , BUD8 Δ 268 - 325 , and BUD8 Δ 268 - 417 . Surprisingly , these strains produced a random budding pattern with a very high frequency ( Fig . 13 ; Table 4 ) . The lowest amount of randomized cells in a population ( around 56 % ) was determined in case of the mutant strain , which expressed the BUD8 Δ 173 - 216 allele . The remaining strains ( BUD8 Δ 173 - 325 , BUD8 Δ 268 - 325 , and BUD8 Δ 268 - 417 ) established this phenotype with a significant higher frequency : 75 - 83 % of the cells developed a random budding pattern . To date this budding phenotype has not been observed for BUD8 mutants , except when BUD8 is completely deleted together with BUD9 resulting in more than 90 % of randomly budding cells ( Taheri et al . , 2000 ) . In addition , random budding is typical for mutations in general budding genes , such as RSR1 / BUD1 , BUD2 or BUD5 , and for mutations affecting the actin cytoskeleton ( Chant et al . , 1991 ; Chant and Herskowitz , 1991 ; Ni and Snyder , 2001 ) . However , the evaluation of the early budding pattern revealed that the random phenotypes of the BUD8 variants differ somewhat from the bud8 Δ bud9 Δ double mutant ( Fig . 15 , Fig . 16 ) as well as the rsr1 Δ / bud1 Δ mutant strain ( Fig . 13 , Fig . 14 ) . While strains with a bud8 Δ bud9 Δ or an rsr1 Δ / bud1 Δ deletion bud randomly already during the initial rounds of cell division of newborn daughter cells , the random budding pattern observed for BUD8 Δ 173 - 216 , BUD8 Δ 173 - 325 , BUD8 Δ 268 - 325 , and BUD8 Δ 268 - 417 mutants required several rounds of cell division to be fully established . However , after 5 to 10 rounds of cell division , the final budding pattern of these mutant strains is very similar to strains lacking BUD8 and BUD9 ( Table 4 ) . R ESULTS 62 Fig . 13 : Regulation of bud site selection by BUD8 mutant alleles in diploid YF cells . Exponentially growing cells were stained with calcofluor to evaluate the budding pattern by fluorescence imaging of YF cells . Representative cells of the diploid strains are shown . RH2495 ( wild - type ) , RH2449 ( bud8 Δ / bud8 Δ ) , RH2448 ( bud1 Δ / bud1 Δ ) , and YHUM996 ( BUD8 ) , a strain expressing a myc - epitope - tagged version of BUD8 , were used as reference strains . The strains carrying truncated versions of BUD8 fused to six myc - epitopes were termed as YHUM843 ( Δ 7 - 53 ) , YHUM844 ( Δ 7 - 114 ) , YHUM847 ( Δ 74 - 114 ) , YHUM848 ( Δ 74 - 216 ) , YHUM849 ( Δ 173 - 216 ) , YHUM850 ( Δ 173 - 325 ) , YHUM851 ( Δ 268 - 325 ) , YHUM852 ( Δ 268 - 417 ) ; YHUM853 ( Δ 375 - 417 ) , YHUM854 ( Δ 375 - 505 ) , YHUM855 ( Δ 468 - 505 ) , and YHUM856 ( Δ 513 - 600 ) . For each strain , the budding pattern of 200 cells was determined from two independent experiments .

The reference strains RH2495 ( wild - type ) , RH2449 ( bud8 Δ / bud8 Δ ) , RH2448 ( bud1 Δ / bud1 Δ ) , and YHUM842 ( BUD8 ) expressing the myc - tagged wild - type protein of BUD8 , as well as the strains carrying integrated versions of different myc - epitope tagged BUD8 alleles ( BUD8 Δ 7 - 53 , BUD8 Δ 7 - 114 , BUD8 Δ 74 - 114 , BUD8 Δ 74 - 216 , BUD8 Δ 173 - 216 , BUD8 Δ 173 - 325 , BUD8 Δ 268 - 325 , BUD8 Δ 268 - 417 , BUD8 Δ 375 - 417 , BUD8 Δ 375 - 505 , BUD8 Δ 468 - 505 , and BUD8 Δ 513 - 600 ) were grown in YPD medium to the logarithmic phase . Cells of the indicated strains were stained with calcofluor to visualize the bud scars . For each strain , the positions of all bud scars were determined for 100 cells with one bud scar ( representing totally 100 bud scars per bar ) , 100 cells with two bud scars ( representing totally 200 bud scars per bar ) , 100 cells with three bud scars ( representing totally 300 bud scars per bar ) , and 100 cells with four bud scars ( representing totally 400 bud scars per bar ) . Bud scars were scored as proximal ( the third comprising the birth end of the cell ) , equatorial ( the middle third of the cell located between proximal and distal cell pole ) , or distal ( the third that is at the opposite to the birth scar ) . Bars represent the percentage of cells at the proximal , the equatorial and the distal region . For each strain , the average value from two independent experiments is shown .

Analysis of budding patterns revealed that the heterozygous BUD8 mutant strains also exhibit a random budding pattern , although somewhat less pronounced as observed in the homozygous diploid mutants ( Table 4 ) . Nevertheless , the presence of the BUD8 wild - type gene was not able to rescue the bipolar phenotype , indicating that all of the mutations are dominant . These data suggest that the segments deleted in the third class of BUD8 mutant alleles might be required for site - specific interaction of Bud8p with the general bud site selection machinery , because these Bud8p variants are able to initiate budding at random sites even in the presence of functional Bud8p . If interaction with the bud site selection machinery was completely lost , the BUD8 alleles would be expected to cause a unipolar proximal pattern as observed in the complete absence of Bud8p . The investigation of the BUD9 mutant alleles with respect to their functionality in bud site selection was performed as in case of the BUD8 mutants and also revealed three different classes ( Figure 15 & 16 , Table 4 ) . The first class comprises three mutant alleles , which code for Bud9p versions truncated at the NH 2 - terminus ( BUD9 Δ 8 - 48 , BUD9 Δ 8 - 130 , or BUD9 Δ 91 - 130 ) . Yeast strains expressing these variants established a bipolar budding pattern and did not differ significantly from a strain expressing the wild - type or a myc - tagged BUD9 gene ( Fig . 15 ) . Thus , similar to Bud8p , the NH 2 - terminal part of Bud9p ( residues 8 - 130 ) is not required for establishment of the bipolar budding . A second class included eight mutants , which carried the BUD9 Δ 91 - 218 , BUD9 Δ 168 - 218 , BUD9 Δ 168 - 283 , BUD9 Δ 244 - 283 , BUD9 Δ 323 - 450 , BUD9 Δ 406 - 450 , BUD9 Δ 406 - 544 , or BUD9 Δ 460 - 544 allele . These mutants select the distal cell pole for budding with a very high frequency over many generations similar to a strain carrying a full deletion of BUD9 ( Fig . 15 & Fig . 16 ) . Thus , the segments deleted in these Bud9p variants are likely to fulfil an essential function of the protein . Two further strains expressing BUD9 Δ 244 - 369 and BUD9 Δ 323 - 369 , respectively , presented a third class of mutants . Similar to randomly budding BUD8 mutants , these BUD9 mutant strains normally recognized the distal cell pole during early rounds of cell division , but had produced a random budding pattern after a larger number of budding events ( Fig . 15 & Fig . 16 ; Table 4 ) . However , random budding frequency was significantly lower than in bud8 Δ R ESULTS 66 bud9 Δ double mutants . When compared to the homozygous BUD9 mutant strains , the corresponding heterozygous BUD9 mutants of this class maintained a significant increase in randomly budding cells , albeit not as pronounced ( Table 4 ) . These results indicate that both alleles BUD9 Δ 244 - 369 and BUD9 Δ 323 - 369 are dominant and that corresponding Bud9p proteins might interfere with regular execution of the bipolar budding program . Fig . 15 : Regulation of bud site selection by BUD9 mutant alleles in diploid YF cells . Cells that were exponentially grown in YPD medium were stained with calcofluor to determine the budding pattern by fluorescence microscopy of YF cells . Representative cells of the diploid strains were shown . RH2495 ( wild - type ) , YHUM993 ( bud9 Δ / bud9 Δ ) , RH2453 ( bud8 Δ / bud8 Δ bud9 Δ / bud9 Δ ) , and YHUM1009 ( BUD9 ) , a strain carrying a myc - tagged wild - type version of the protein , were used as controls . The strains expressing truncated versions of BUD9 tagged with nine myc - epitopes were termed as YHUM1010 ( Δ 8 - 48 ) , YHUM1011 ( Δ 8 - 130 ) , YHUM1012 ( Δ 91 - 130 ) , YHUM1013 ( Δ 91 - 218 ) , YHUM1014 ( Δ 168 - 218 ) , YHUM1015 ( Δ 168 - 283 ) , YHUM1016 ( Δ 244 - 283 ) , YHUM1017 ( Δ 244 - 369 ) ; YHUM1018 ( Δ 323 - 369 ) , YHUM1019 ( Δ 323 - 450 ) , YHUM1020 ( Δ 406 - 450 ) , YHUM1021 ( Δ 406 - 544 ) , and YHUM1022 ( Δ 460 - 544 ) . For each strain , the budding pattern of 200 cells was determined . The average value from two independent experiments is displayed . R ESULTS 67 Fig . 16 : Quantitative evaluation of the bud scar distribution in BUD9 mutant strains . The distribution of bud scars of wild type and myc - epitope tagged BUD9 mutant strains was determined by fluorescence imaging . Therefore , cells of the indicated strains were exponentially grown in YPD medium and then stained with calcofluor to visualize the bud scars . RH2495 ( wild - type ) , YHUM993 ( bud9 Δ / bud9 Δ ) , RH2453 ( bud8 Δ / bud8 Δ bud9 Δ / bud9 Δ ) , and YHUM1009 ( BUD9 ) expressing the myc - tagged wild - type protein were used as reference strains . Strains expressing truncated versions of BUD9 fused to a myc 9 epitope were termed as YHUM1010 ( Δ 8 - 48 ) , YHUM1011 ( Δ 8 - 130 ) , YHUM1012 ( Δ 91 - 130 ) , YHUM1013 ( Δ 91 - 218 ) , YHUM1014 ( Δ 168 - 218 ) , YHUM1015 ( Δ 168 - 283 ) , YHUM1016 ( Δ 244 - 283 ) , YHUM1017 ( Δ 244 - 369 ) ; YHUM1018 ( Δ 323 - 369 ) , YHUM1019 ( Δ 323 - 450 ) , YHUM1020 ( Δ 406 - 450 ) , YHUM1021 ( Δ 406 - 544 ) , and YHUM1022 ( Δ 460 - 544 ) . For each experiment , the positions of all bud scars were determined for 100 cells with one bud scar , 100 cells with two bud scars , 100 cells with three bud scars , and 100 cells with four bud scars ( representing in total 100 , 200 , 300 or 400 bud scars per bar ) . The positions of all bud scars were scored as proximal cell pole ( the third comprising the birth end of the cell ) , equatorial ( the middle third of the cell located between proximal and distal cell pole ) , or distal cell pole ( the third that is at the opposite to the birth scar ) . Bars represent the percentage of cells at the proximal , the equatorial , or the distal third . For each strain , the average value from two independent experiments is shown . R ESULTS 68 3 . 2 . 2 . 2 Axial budding of haploid strains Previous studies have shown that BUD8 and BUD9 are expressed also in haploid strains , although in this cell type the haploid - specific landmark protein Bud10p mainly functions as spatial landmark at the proximal pole . Thus , it is possible that altered variants of Bud8p and Bud9p could influence the budding pattern of haploid yeast cells . To test this possibility , the budding patterns of haploid a - strains expressing selected BUD8 and BUD9 mutant alleles were determined ( Table 5 ) . A strain expressing wild - type Bud8p and Bud9p produced the well - known axial budding pattern , in which the mother and daughter cells are constrained to form their buds immediately adjacent to the previous site of cell separation with a very high frequency ( Table 5 ) . In the case of Bud8p , the budding pattern of a haploid strain expressing a myc 6 - tagged full - length version of BUD8 was phenotypically almost indistinguishable from the haploid wild - type strain , as more than 90 % of cells of this strain developed an axial pattern . Similarly , development of an axial pattern could be observed for most of the strains expressing truncated BUD8 versions including BUD8 Δ 7 - 53 , BUD8 Δ 7 - 114 , BUD8 Δ 74 - 216 , BUD8 Δ 173 - 325 , BUD8 Δ 268 - 325 , BUD8 Δ 375 - 505 , BUD8 Δ 468 - 505 , and BUD8 Δ 513 - 600 . However , in the case of a strain expressing the Bud8p Δ 268 - 417 variant , every forth cell produced either a random or a bipolar pattern , and only 75 % of the cells divided in an axial pattern . Thus , this variant of Bud8p might interfere with downstream components required for the bud site selection programs not only in diploids ( see 3 . 2 . 2 . 1 ) but also in haploid cells . The evaluation of the budding patterns of haploid strains expressing different BUD9 variants revealed similar results as found for the haploid BUD8 mutants . A haploid strain expressing the myc 9 - tagged full - length version of BUD9 produced an axial pattern that does not distinguishable from the haploid reference strain . All of the examined strains producing the truncated versions Bud9p Δ 8 - 48 , Bud9p Δ 8 - 130 , Bud9p Δ 91 - 218 , Bud9p Δ 168 - 218 , Bud9p Δ 168 - 283 , Bud9p Δ 244 - 369 , Bud9p Δ 323 - 450 , Bud9p Δ 406 - 450 , Bud9p Δ 406 - 544 or Bud9p Δ 460 - 544 also produced an axial budding pattern with a very high frequency . In summary , most of the Bud8p and Bud9p mutant proteins do not interfere with haploid budding process indicating that although Bud8p and Bud9p are expressed in this cell type , levels might be sufficient to affect the interaction of Bud10p with downstream acting general budding components .

For this purpose , fusions to fluorescent proteins should be created . To ensure that signals were produced that are suitable for the measurements , different fluorescent marker proteins were fused to unaltered Bud8p and Bud9p by creation of gene fusions that were also expressed at different levels . 3 . 2 . 3 . 1 Investigation of different Bud8p and Bud9p fusion proteins for localization studies First , fusion genes of GFP with BUD8 and BUD9 that are expressed from their own promoters had to be generated . When GFP - BUD8 was expressed from low - copy plasmids , the signals produced were very weak , and only in exceptional cases GFP - Bud8p could be localized by GFP fluorescence microscopy . In the case of strains carrying a low - copy GFP - BUD9 plasmid no fluorescent signal was detectable . Because of the difficulties GFP - BUD8 and GFP - BUD9 were expressed from high - copy - number plasmids . In general , high - copy expression of GFP - BUD8 led to a remarkable increase of cells with a detectable signal . Furthermore , the signals were brighter and more defined than signals obtained using low - copy - number plasmids , although the localization patterns were comparable . In contrast , strains carrying a high - copy GFP - BUD9 plasmid , still only little or no signals were detectable . Therefore , the GFP portion was replaced with YFP , and YFP - BUD9 fusions were expressed from high - copy plasmid . As a consequence , the amount of cells showing detectable fluorescent signals was considerably higher . Typically , the fusion protein was observed as spot at the tip of the growing daughter cell throughout cell division . Moreover , YFP - Bud9p was found to be concentrated as distinct patch at one pole in unbudded cells , and as spot between mother and daughter cell . 3 . 2 . 3 . 2 Localization of Bud8p and Bud9p deletion proteins On the basis of the results described the previous section , BUD8 deletion alleles were NH 2 - terminally fused to GFP and BUD9 deletion variants to YFP . Fusion genes were then expressed in diploid strains from high - copy plasmids to determine the localization of mutant proteins by fluorescence microscopy . R ESULTS 71 Localization analysis of different GFP - Bud8p variant in bud8 Δ mutant strains led to three types of localization patterns ( Fig . 17 ) . The full - length protein of Bud8p and five fusion proteins ( GFP - Bud8p Δ 7 - 53 , GFP - Bud8p Δ 7 - 114 , GFP - Bud8p Δ 74 - 114 , GFP - Bud8p Δ 74 - 216 and GFP - Bud8p Δ 468 - 505 ) produced similar localization patterns and defined a first class . These proteins were localized on only one side of unbudded cells . In the case of GFP - Bud8p Δ 74 - 114 the localization was slightly different . Most of the unbudded cells of the corresponding strain showed a characteristic spot at one side of the cell , but in some cases had patches at both cell poles as well as weak signals along the plasma membrane were visible . This result agrees with earlier observations , where high - level expression of GFP - BUD8 led to detectable signals at both cell poles ( Harkins et al . , 2001 ) . In small - and large - budded cells , Bud8p variants of this first class appeared in form of crescent - like structures at the tip of daughters and at the mother side of the bud neck ( Fig . 17B , C , D , E , L ) . With the exception of Bud8p Δ 468 - 505 , Bud8p variants that produce this first class of localization pattern carry truncations at the NH 2 - terminus , indicating that the NH 2 - terminal part of Bud8p does not carry signals for correct delivery of the protein to the distal cell pole . GFP - Bud8p Δ 173 - 216 , GFP - Bud8p Δ 173 - 325 , GFP - Bud8p Δ 268 - 325 , and GFP - Bud8p Δ 268 - 417 that contain truncations in the median segment of Bud8p define a second type of localization pattern . Mutant proteins belonging to this group are not delivered to the expected bud site ( Fig . 17F , G , H , I ) . Actually , these proteins are evenly distributed at the cell periphery . Two strains of this group ( carrying the GFP - BUD8 Δ 173 - 325 and GFP - BUD8 Δ 268 - 325 allele , respectively ) showed an additional distinctive feature : some of the budded YF cells had detectable signals at the tip of nascent buds of various sizes ( Fig . 17G , H ) . These observations were rather faint . To this end , it could not be clarified whether this irregular appearance of fluorescence signals at the tips of daughter cells were artefacts because of the high - level expression of the proteins or whether this pattern was actually typical for localization pattern of these mutant proteins . The results indicate that the median part of Bud8p might be required for either delivery of the proteins to polar positions or for polar maintenance after delivery . A third type of localization pattern was defined by the GFP - BUD8 Δ 375 - 417 , GFP - BUD8 Δ 375 - 505 , and GFP - BUD8 Δ 513 - 600 fusion genes , which code for variants of Bud8p with truncations at the COOH - terminus ( Fig . 17J , K , M ) . This group of proteins was characterized by their appearance as patches at the mother - daughter neck region and dot - like structures along the cell periphery of mother and daughter cells . Remarkably , rapid movement R ESULTS 72 of dot - like structures of GFP - Bud8p variants along the cell periphery could frequently be observed . In addition , a significant amount of the proteins was found to be enriched in the cytoplasm . These variants might define segments in the COOH - terminal part of the protein that are essential for the delivery of the protein to the cell surface and the distal cell pole . Fig . 17 : Subcellular localization of GFP - Bud8p mutant proteins in living cells . Representative cells of a diploid bud8 Δ strain RH2449 expressing either a GFP - fused wild - type version of Bud8p ( A ) from the plasmid BHUM824 or GFP - Bud8p variants from the plasmids BHUM825 ( B , Δ 7 - 53 ) , BHUM826 ( C , Δ 7 - 114 ) , BHUM827 ( D , Δ 74 - 114 ) , BHUM828 ( E , Δ 74 - 216 ) , BHUM829 ( F , Δ 173 - 216 ) , BHUM830 ( G , Δ 173 - 325 ) , BHUM831 ( H , Δ 268 - 325 ) , BHUM832 ( I , Δ 268 - 417 ) , BHUM833 ( J , Δ 375 - 417 ) , BHUM834 ( K , Δ 375 - 505 ) , BHUM835 ( L , Δ 468 - 505 ) , and BHUM836 ( M , Δ 513 - 600 ) , respectively , were shown . Pre - cultures of corresponding Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were grown overnight in YNB - medium . Main cultures were inoculated in the same medium and were grown to the exponential phase . Living cells were visualized under the microscope using Nomarski optics or fluorescence microscopy ( GFP ) . J and K show time - lapse observations of GFP - Bud8p variants with images collected at intervals of 30 sec . R ESULTS 73 Analysis of the different YFP - Bud9p mutant proteins by fluorescence microscopy defined four different types of localization pattern ( Fig . 18 ) . The six mutant proteins YFP - Bud9p Δ 8 - 48 , YFP - Bud9p Δ 8 - 130 , YFP - Bud9p Δ 91 - 130 , YFP - Bud9p Δ 91 - 218 , YFP - Bud9p Δ 168 - 218 , and the YFP - Bud9p Δ 323 - 369 produced a similar localization pattern as the full - length YFP - Bud9p control and defined a first class . In unbudded cells , these proteins appeared as single patches at one or both poles ( Fig . 18B , C , D , E , F , J ) . The results of previous studies suggest that these cells were daughter cells that had never budded before ( Harkins et al . , 2001 ) . In small - budded cells , these proteins were typically found at the tip of daughters and in mother cells at the pole opposite to the neck . In large - budded cells , proteins were found at the tip of daughters and in addition with high frequency at the mother - bud neck . All proteins producing this type of localization pattern ( except YFP - Bud9p Δ 323 - 369 ) contain truncations in the NH 2 - terminal region , indicating that this part of protein does not carry sequences essential for normal localization of Bud9p . A second type of localization pattern was defined by YFP - Bud9p Δ 168 - 263 , YFP - Bud9p Δ 244 - 263 , and YFP - Bud9p Δ 244 - 369 . These proteins produced enhanced cytoplasmic staining of cells . No significant difference with regard to fluorescence intensity in budded and unbudded cells could be observed ( Fig . 18G , H , I ) . As a common feature this group of mutant proteins contain truncations in the median segment of Bud9p , indicating that this part of the Bud9p protein might be required for correct delivery to the cell surface . A third group of proteins included YFP - Bud9p Δ 323 - 450 and YFP - Bud9p Δ 406 - 450 that contain truncations , which are adjacent to the region coding for the transmembrane domains . Typically , fluorescent signals were detectable as patches at the tip of the daughter cells . A specific feature of this class of Bud9p proteins is that they are concentrated predominantly in small - budded YF cells ( Fig . 18K , L ) . In general , the amount of cells producing clear signals was lower than in the wild - type strain and the patches observed at the bud tips were often diffuse . Despite these complications , the localization pattern was similar in all cells that produced a detectable signal . A forth class of mutant proteins was defined by YFP - Bud9p Δ 406 - 544 and the YFP - Bud9p Δ 460 - 544 that are characterized by deletion of both transmembrane domains . These proteins were enriched in the cytoplasm and in addition often formed a distinct spot at the tip of the growing daughter ( Fig . 18M , N ) . Strikingly , signals could be detected predominantly in cells with small - or medium - sized buds . In unbudded cells , YFP - Bud9p Δ 406 - 544 and R ESULTS 74 YFP - Bud9p Δ 460 - 544 typically accumulated in form of a single patch at one cell pole . In exceptional cases , the proteins were delivered to the neck region ( Fig . 18M ) . Fig . 18 : Localization of Bud9p mutant proteins with the use of YFP - tagged proteins in living cells . Representative cells of a diploid bud9 Δ strain YHUM993 expressing either an YFP - fused wild - type version of Bud9p ( A ) from the plasmid BHUM837 or YFP - Bud9p variants from the plasmids BHUM838 ( B , Δ 8 - 48 ) , BHUM839 ( C , Δ 8 - 130 ) , BHUM840 ( D , Δ 91 - 130 ) , BHUM841 ( E , Δ 91 - 218 ) , BHUM842 ( F , Δ 168 - 218 ) , BHUM843 ( G , Δ 168 - 283 ) , BHUM844 ( H , Δ 244 - 283 ) , BHUM845 ( I , Δ 244 - 369 ) , BHUM846 ( J , Δ 323 - 369 ) , BHUM847 ( K , Δ 323 - 450 ) , BHUM848 ( L , Δ 406 - 450 ) , BHUM849 ( M , Δ 406 - 544 ) , and BHUM850 ( N , Δ 460 - 544 ) , respectively , were shown . Pre - cultures of corresponding Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were grown overnight in YNB - medium . Main cultures were inoculated in the same medium and were grown to the exponential phase . Living cells of different stages of the cell cycle were chosen for photography and were viewed under the microscope using Nomarski optics or by fluorescence microscopy ( YFP ) . R ESULTS 75 In summary , examination of the localization patterns of Bud9p deletion proteins leads to the conclusion that the NH 2 - terminal part of Bud9p is not required for normal localization and that segments of both the median and the COOH - terminal region might confer transport of the protein to the cell surface and / or the proximal cell pole . Thus , the segments of Bud8p and Bud9p necessary for the delivery of the proteins to the correct cell pole appear to cover similar regions of the polypeptides . In both cases the NH 2 - terminal part is not required but delivery of the proteins to the cell periphery depends on the median part . In addition , both proteins require parts of the COOH - terminal domains for correct polar localization . 3 . 3 Investigation of Bud8p and Bud9p interaction partners 3 . 3 . 1 Bud9p exhibits in vivo protein - protein - association with Bud5p Previous studies have revealed that Bud8p and Bud9p interact with the cortical tag protein Rax1p to establish the cortical landmarks ( Kang et al . , 2004b ) . However , the Rax1p - interacting domains of Bud8p and Bud9p are not known . In addition , Bud8p has been shown to interact with the GDP / GTP exchange factor Bud5p , a component of the general bud site selection machinery ( Kang et al . , 2004a ) . Again , the Bud5p - interacting domains of Bud8p are not known , but it has been shown that the NH 2 - terminal part of Bud5p is required for interaction with Bud8p . Whether Bud9p also interacts with Bud5p is not known . In a first step , the association between Bud5p and Bud8p was confirmed . For this purpose , the haploid strain YHUM1008 ( MAT α , bud8 Δ : : HIS3 , ura3 - 52 , his3 : : hisG , leu2 : : hisG , trp1 : : hisG ) was transformed with BHUM1041 ( GST - BUD5 N Δ 1 - 70 ) and BHUM1042 ( GST - BUD5 ) , respectively . BHUM532 , which carries a sequence coding for myc 6 - BUD8 , was transformed into the haploid MAT a - strain YHUM1027 ( congenic to YHUM1008 ) . Appropriate transformants were mated to generate diploid strains expressing for co - immunoprecipitation . By crossing , two strains were obtained , one expressing myc 6 - Bud8p together with GST - Bud5p , the other expressing myc 6 - Bud8p in combination with the truncated version GST - Bud5p N Δ 1 - 70 . Further analyses revealed that GST - Bud5p was visible reproducibly as strong signal around 100 kDa . GST - Bud5p N Δ 1 - 70 could be detected around 90 kDa . In case of both Bud5p variants , additional signals were observed as lower molecular forms , which might be caused R ESULTS 76 by proteolytic degradation of the proteins . Myc - epitope - tagged Bud8p appeared as pattern consisting of three bands in the range from 85 to 140 kDa . Extracts were then incubated with glutathione - sepharose to purify GST - Bud5p and associated proteins . Affinity purified extracts were again analyzed by immunoblotting for the presence of Bud5p variants and myc 6 - Bud8p ( Fig . 19 ) . As expected , these GST pulldown experiments confirmed the studies of Kang et al . ( 2004a ) and demonstrate that Bud8p can be co - purified with GST - Bud5p but not with a truncated version of Bud5p lacking the N - terminal 70 amino acids ( Fig . 19 ) . To investigate a possible interaction between Bud5p and Bud9p , transformation and crossing of corresponding yeast strains were carried out essentially as described for Bud8p : Plasmids carrying sequences encoding different Bud5p variants ( see above for description of BHUM1041 and BHUM1042 ) were each transformed in YHUM995 ( MAT α , bud9 Δ : : HIS3 , ura3 - 52 , his3 : : hisG , leu2 : : hisG , trp1 : : hisG ) . Plasmid BHUM1027 carrying myc 9 - BUD9 was transformed into the haploid MAT a - strain YHUM994 ( congenic to YHUM995 ) . Appropriate transformants were mated to yield two strains that carry myc 9 - BUD9 / GST - BUD5 N Δ 1 - 70 and myc 9 - BUD9 / GST - BUD5 alleles , respectively . Immunoblot analysis of crude extracts revealed that GST - Bud5p variants and myc - tagged Bud9p were expressed properly ( Fig . 19 ) . These strains were then used for co - affinity purification analysis as described in case of Bud8p . Analysis of affinity - purified extracts revealed Bud9p was efficiently co - purified with full - length GST - Bud5p but not with the truncated version GST - Bud5p N Δ 1 - 70 ( Fig . 19 ) . Thus , similar to Bud8p , Bud9p associates with Bud5p via the NH 2 - terminal part of this GDP / GTP exchange factor . R ESULTS 77 Fig . 19 : Interaction of Bud8p and Bud9p proteins with Bud5p . Protein extracts were prepared from diploid yeast strains carrying the plasmid BHUM723 ( BUD8 ) or BHUM1027 ( BUD9 ) in combination with pHP772 ( GST - BUD5 Δ 1 - 70 ; Kang et al . , 2004a ) and pHP1301 ( GST - BUD5 ; Kang et al . , 2004a ) , respectively . GST - Bud5p constructs were pulled down with glutathione - sepharose . Presence of Bud8p and Bud9p , respectively , was analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti - myc antibody ( α - myc ) , and GST was detected using antibodies against GST ( α - GST ) . 3 . 3 . 2 Distinct parts of Bud8p and Bud9p interact with Bud5p In a next step , regions of Bud8p and Bud9p should be identified , which mediate interaction with the GDP / GTP exchange factor Bud5p . Therefore , deletion variants of Bud8p and Bud9p as described in chapter 3 . 2 . 1 were used with respect to their ability to associate with full - length Bud5p fused to GST . For this purpose , yeast strains were used that carry GST - BUD5 on a plasmid ( pHP1301 ) and either myc 6 - BUD8 alleles or myc 9 - BUD9 alleles on a second plasmid . After induction of GST - BUD5 expression , protein extracts were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting before and after co - affinity purification with glutathione - sepharose . R ESULTS 78 Fig . 20 : Interaction of Bud8p and Bud9p deletion constructs with Bud5p . ( A ) Co - purification of different variants of Bud8p with GST - Bud5p . Protein extracts were prepared from diploid yeast strains carrying the plasmid pHP1301 ( GST - BUD5 ; Kang et al . , 2004a ) in combination with BHUM723 ( BUD8 ) , BHUM1016 ( Δ 7 - 53 ) , BHUM1017 ( Δ 7 - 114 ) , BHUM1018 ( Δ 74 - 114 ) , BHUM1019 ( Δ 74 - 216 ) , BHUM1020 ( Δ 173 - 216 ) , BHUM1021 ( Δ 173 - 325 ) , BHUM1022 ( Δ 268 - 325 ) , BHUM1023 ( Δ 268 - 417 ) , BHUM1024 ( Δ 375 - 417 ) , BHUM1025 ( Δ 375 - 505 ) , BHUM706 ( Δ 513 - 600 ) , and GST - Bud5p was pulled down with glutathione - sepharose . Presence of Bud8p proteins in extracts before ( input ) and after GST - Bud5p pull downs was analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti - myc antibody ( α - myc ) , and GST was detected using antibodies against GST ( α - GST ) . ( B ) Co - purification of different variants of Bud9p with GST - Bud5p was analyzed using diploid yeast strains carrying plasmid pHP1301 and the plasmid BHUM1027 ( BUD9 ) , BHUM1028 ( Δ 8 - 48 ) , BHUM1029 ( Δ 8 - 130 ) , BHUM1030 ( Δ 91 - 130 ) , BHUM1031 ( Δ 91 - 218 ) , BHUM1032 ( Δ 168 - 218 ) , BHUM1033 ( Δ 168 - 283 ) , BHUM1034 ( Δ 244 - 283 ) , BHUM1035 ( Δ 244 - 369 ) , BHUM1036 ( Δ 323 - 369 ) , BHUM1037 ( Δ 323 - 450 ) , BHUM1037 ( Δ 406 - 450 ) , BHUM1038 ( Δ 406 - 450 ) , BHUM1039 ( Δ 460 - 450 ) , or BHUM1040 ( Δ 460 - 544 ) . R ESULTS 79 In the case of Bud8p , all mutant proteins were produced at levels comparable to the wild - type protein and appeared dependent on their size between 70 and 150 kDa when analyzing crude extracts . Analysis of affinity - purified extracts showed that Bud8p Δ 7 - 53 , Bud8p Δ 7 - 114 , Bud8p Δ 74 - 114 , Bud8p Δ 173 - 216 , Bud8p Δ 173 - 325 , Bud8p Δ 268 - 325 , Bud8p Δ 268 - 417 , Bud8p Δ 468 - 505 , and Bud8p Δ 513 - 600 could be co - purified with GST - Bud5p ( Fig . 20A ) . However , Bud8p Δ 74 - 216 , Bud8p Δ 375 - 417 and Bud8p Δ 375 - 505 failed to co - purify with GST - Bud5p , indicating that the segments absent in these variants of Bud8p might confer association with Bud5p . In the case of Bud9p , analysis of protein crude extracts showed that all fusion variants of Bud9p were detectable as multiple signals ( mainly as double bands ) between 70 and 115 kDa ( Fig . 20B ) . Affinity purification revealed that Bud9p Δ 8 - 48 , Bud9p Δ 8 - 130 , Bud9p Δ 91 - 130 , Bud9p Δ 168 - 218 , Bud9p Δ 244 - 369 , Bud9p Δ 323 - 369 , and Bud9p Δ 460 - 544 proteins could be co - purified with GST - Bud5p ( Fig . 20B ) . In contrast , Bud9p Δ 91 - 218 , Bud9p Δ 168 - 283 , Bud9p Δ 244 - 283 , and Bud9p Δ 406 - 544 did not associate with Bud5p ( Fig . 20B ) . In summary , the results of these interaction studies between the GDP / GTP exchange factor Bud5p and the pole marker proteins indicate that both Bud8p and Bud9p contain distinct domains that confer a direct or an indirect association with Bud5p . 3 . 3 . 3 Bud8p and Bud9p physically interact with Rax1p 3 . 3 . 3 . 1 Distinct parts of Bud8p and Bud9p interact with Rax1p Based on the findings from Kang et al . ( 2004b ) who identified Rax1p as interaction partner of Bud8p and Bud9p , we were interested to clarify which parts of both landmark proteins might be involved in association with Rax1p . For this purpose , the diploid strain YHUM829 was co - transformed with plasmid pHP1156 carrying GST - RAX1 together with a second plasmid carrying either different myc 6 - BUD8 genes or myc 9 - BUD9 genes ( see previous section ) . Protein crude extracts were then prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting before and after affinity purification with glutathione - sepharose . These experiments revealed that mutant proteins of Bud8p lacking the regions 173 - 216 , 268 - 417 , 468 - 505 , or 513 - 600 could be co - purified with GST - Rax1p indicating that these truncated versions of Bud8p are not required for interaction with Rax1p ( Fig . 21A ) . In the case of Bud8p Δ 74 - 216 , Bud8p Δ 268 - 325 , and Bud8p Δ 375 - 505 , co - purification with Rax1p was partially reduced , suggesting that these variants lack regions that are in part essential for Rax1p - binding ( Fig . 21A ) . In the case of Bud8p Δ 7 - 114 and Bud8p Δ 74 - 114 , no co - purification with R ESULTS 80 GST - Rax1p was possible , indicating that the region lacking in these proteins is essential for association with Rax1p ( Fig . 21A ) . In the case of Bud9p , Bud9p Δ 8 - 48 , Bud9p Δ 8 - 130 , Bud9p Δ 91 - 218 , Bud9p Δ 168 - 218 , Bud9p Δ 244 - 369 , and Bud9p Δ 323 - 450 could be co - purified with GST - Rax1p ( Fig . 21B ) . In the case of Bud9p Δ 168 - 283 , Bud9p Δ 406 - 450 , Bud9p Δ 406 - 544 , and Bud9p Δ 460 - 544 , interaction with Rax1p was significantly reduced or not detectable , indicating that these variants lack domains that are essential for efficient association with Rax1p ( Fig . 21B ) . Fig . 21 : Co - purification of different variants of Bud8p and Bud9p with Rax1p . Interaction of Bud8p with Rax1p was analyzed in diploid yeast strains carrying the plasmid pHP1156 ( Kang et al . , 2004b ) and either one of the plasmids expressing different variants of BUD8 ( A ) or BUD9 ( B ) as described in Fig . 20 . Conclusively , these results indicate that both Bud8p and Bud9p contain specific domains that confer a direct or an indirect association with Rax1p .

Previous studies have shown that higher molecular weight forms of the proteins stem in part from N - and O - glycosylation ( Harkins et al . , 2001 ) . To learn more about the kinetics of post - translational modifications of Bud8p and Bud9p , the appearance of high mobility forms of the proteins should be analyzed by pulse - chase experiments . For this purpose , yeast strains expressing myc 6 - BUD8 and myc 9 - BUD9 were grown overnight at 25°C in minimal medium supplemented with nutrients as needed to maintain the corresponding plasmid . Cells were pulse - labelled with 35 [ S ] methionine / cysteine , and after 10 minutes of labeling , the chase was initiated by addition of an excess of unlabelled methionine and cysteine . Samples were then taken at different time points , with the first one directly after the pulse to define the time point ' 0 ' and the last one 30 minutes after the chase . Protein extracts were then prepared , and myc 6 - Bud8p and myc 9 - Bud9p proteins were analyzed by immunoprecipitation using anti - myc - antibodies and Protein A - sepharose followed by separation of the proteins in SDS - PAGE and autoradiography . In the case of Bud8p , no specific signals could be detected preventing further analysis . However , in the case of Bud9p , the protein could be detected directly after the pulse as a well - defined signal around 85 kDa corresponding to the calculated molecular weight of myc 9 - Bud9p ( Fig . 22 ) . In course of time , this signal became increasingly weaker and more indistinct . However , after 30 minutes , an additional band could be observed in the range of 95 kDa indicating the enrichment of a modified form of Bud9p . To further characterize the kinetics of modification of Bud9p , the pulse - chase experiment was repeated , but sampling was performed in 10 minutes intervals over a time period of 60 minutes . Kinetics of Bud9p modification was similar , in that after 30 minutes approximately 50 % of the protion was shifted to higher mobility . After 60 minutes , most of the signal at 85 kDa had been shifted to a signal around 95 kDa indicating that modifications of newly synthesized Bud9p takes about 60 minutes to finish . R ESULTS 83 Fig . 22 : Pulse - chase experiments with myc 9 - Bud9p . Shown are two independent pulse chase experiments tracing myc 9 - Bud9p expressed in high - copy manner in wild - type strain BY4742 . After a pulse of 10 minutes with 35 S - methionine and 35 S - cysteine , samples were taken at chase time points of 0 and 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , and 30 minutes . In the second experiment , samples were taken at time points 0 and 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , and 60 minutes . Myc 9 - Bud9p was isolated from these samples by immunoprecipitation , separated by SDS - PAGE , and detected by autoradiographies after exposure to X - ray film material . 3 . 4 . 2 Post - translational modification of Bud8p and Bud9p occur independent of Sec18p To address the question of how Bud8p and Bud9p are transported to the cytoplasmic membrane , proteins were analyzed in a temperature - sensitive sec18 mutant . SEC18 encodes an ATPase required for the release of Sec17p during the priming step in homotypic vacuole fusion and for ER - to - Golgi transport ( Newman and Ferro - Novick , 1990 ) . Thus , protein transport between the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and the Golgi complex is disrupted in a sec18 ts mutant strain at restrictive temperature . To analyze , whether transport and post - translational modification of Bud8p and Bud9p depend on Sec18p , myc 6 - BUD8 and myc 9 - BUD9 on high - copy plasmids were each transformed into the haploid wild - type strain BY4742 ( Brachmann et al . , 1998 ) and the temperature - sensitive haploid sec18 - 1 mutant strain S18H3 ( H . - D . Schmitt , personal communication ) . Resulting strains were first analyzed for expression of Bud8p and Bud9p when grown at permissive temperature : Strains were grown to mid - log phase before preparation of total protein extracts and analysis of myc 6 - Bud8p and myc 9 - Bud9p by Western blot hybridization ( Fig . 23A ) . In both cases the control and the sec18 ts mutant strain , myc 6 - Bud8p and myc 9 - Bud9p was expressed at normal levels and exhibited the post - translationally modified forms . In a next step , Sec18p - dependent post - translational modification of Bud8p and Bud9p was analyzed by pulse - chase experiments ( Fig . 23B ) . For this purpose , the myc 6 - BUD8 - and R ESULTS 84 myc 9 - BUD9 - expressing control and sec18 ts strains were grown at the permissive temperature , and pulse - chase experiments were performed both at permissive ( 28°C ) and at restrictive ( 37°C ) temperature . Myc 6 - Bud8p and myc 9 - Bud9p proteins were analyzed by immuno - precipitation followed by SDS - PAGE and autoradiography to detect 35 S - labelled proteins at the time points directly at the pulse and 20 minutes after the chase . In the case of myc 6 - Bud8p , the protein appeared as a distinct band at 80 kDa in the control strain grown at the permissive temperature when analyzed directly after the chase . Most likely this band represents the unmodified form , because its size corresponds to the calculated molecular weight of myc 6 - Bud8p . However , a shift to a higher molecular weight of 120 kDa was observed after 20 minutes , indicating that Bud8p had become post - translationally modified . Interestingly , the higher band of 120 kDa could be observed already very slightly after the chase in control strains grown at the restrictive temperature , which might indicate , that post - translational modification is temperature - regulated . However , similar patterns were observed for myc 6 - Bud8p when expressed in the sec18 ts mutant strain , although expression levels were significantly reduced . However , the time depending shift to the 120 kDa band was not suppressed at the restrictive temperature , indicating that post - translational modification observed is not dependent on Sec18p . Similar results have been obtained for myc 9 - Bud9p . A shift in the apparent molecular weight from 85 kDa to 95 kDa could be observed at the permissive temperature in both a control and a sec18 ts mutant strain . At the restrictive temperature , the higher molecular weight band at 95 kDa could be observed already after the chase ( time point 0 ) , again both in a control strain and a sec18 ts mutant strain . Thus , as in the case of Bud8p , post - translational modification of Bud9p appears to depend on the temperature but not on Sec18p . In summary , both Bud8p and Bud9p seem to be transported to the plasma - membrane on a SEC18 - independent mechanism , if the post - translational modifications represents N - and O - glycosylation , which is expected to occur by transport of the proteins through the secretory pathway . R ESULTS 85 Fig . 23 : Analysis of post - translational modifications of Bud8p and Bud9p . ( A ) Western analysis of myc 6 - BUD8 and myc 9 - BUD9 constructs . For Western hybridizations , crude extracts from yeast strains BY4742 and S18H3 were prepared , which express either six - fold myc - tagged Bud8p or nine - fold myc - tagged Bud9p , respectively , and separated under denaturing conditions by SDS - PAGE . After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes both fusion proteins were detected by cross - reaction with an anti - myc primary antibody and an anti - murine secondary antibody . For standardization of protein contents , levels of Cdc42p were detected by an anti - Cdc42p antibody . ( B ) Post - translational modification of Bud8p and Bud9p in a sec18 ts mutant strain . Cultures of yeast strains BY4742 ( wild - type control ) and S18H3 ( sec18 - 1 mutant ) transformed with BHUM498 and BHUM795 , respectively , were split and subjected to pulse chase experiments at 25°C or 37°C . For that purpose , cells were labeled for 10 minutes at the respective temperature by addition of 35 S - trans - label mix ( pulse ) . Samples were isolated immediately after the pulse as well as after 20 minutes . Myc - tagged proteins were enriched from these samples by immunoprecipitation , separated by SDS - PAGE , and detected by autoradiography . 86 4 . Discussion The two membrane - bound glycoproteins Bud8p and Bud9p are thought to function as cortical tags for spatial control of cell division in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , which is necessary to establish the bipolar budding pattern that is observed in diploid yeast cells ( Harkins et al . , 2001 ; Taheri et al . , 2000 ; Zahner et al . , 1996 ) . Bud8p acts by directing bud initiation to the distal cell pole , whereas Bud9p functions to tag the proximal pole . However , the exact molecular mechanisms by which Bud8p and Bud9p act to control site - specific initiation of budding are not fully understood . It is thought that Bud8p and Bud9p are delivered to the cell surface in vesicles via the secretory pathway during specific stages of the cell cycle ( Schenkman et al . , 2002 ) . Timing of BUD8 and BUD9 expression appears to be important for a correct localization of both Bud8p and Bud9p , and each of the proteins must contain specific domains that are required for localization and function ( Schenkman et al . , 2002 ) . Two further proteins , Rax1p and Rax2p , are involved in correct localization and function of Bud8p and Bud9p ( Kang et al . , 2004b ) , and the GDP / GTP exchange factor Bud5p interacts with Bud8p ( Kang et al . , 2004a ) , suggesting that the Bud1p GTPase signaling module recognizes the spatial cues for bipolar budding . In this work , the landmark proteins Bud8p and Bud9p were further characterized to better understand the polar transport and the function of these cortical tag components . The major findings of this study will be discussed below and concern ( i ) co - localization of Bud8p and Bud9p , ( ii ) post - translational modification of the proteins , and ( iii ) the identification of domains in Bud8p and Bud9p that are necessary for delivery and anchoring at the cell poles or interaction with the general bud site selection machinery . 4 . 1 Bud8p and Bud9p co - localize at the distal cell pole in growing buds In previous studies , Bud8p could be primarily detected at the distal pole of mother and daughter cells , and Bud9p was detected at the proximal pole of the daughter cell ( Harkins et al . , 2001 ; Taheri et al . , 2000 ) . In addition , Bud9p was found at the distal pole , leading to the assumption that Bud9p not only fulfils the function as proximal pole marker but might also acts a negative regulator of Bud8p at the distal cell pole ( Taheri et al . , 2000 ) . One concern of this particular study might be the use of the genetic Σ 1287b strain background to analyze the localization of Bud9p . In this previous study , carried out in this genetic background , GFP - Bud9p was predominantly detected at the tips of small - and large - budded D ISCUSSION 87 daughters , whereas any localization at the mother - bud neck of large - budded cells was only observed infrequently . Other studies , in which another strain background had been used , stated that GFP - Bud9p could be found predominantly at the proximal pole of unbudded cells and at the bud site of the neck in large - budded cells ( Harkins et al . , 2001 ; Schenkman et al . , 2002 ) . During preliminary tests , Bud9p fused to different fluorescent proteins ( GFP , CFP , YFP ) was investigated with respect to brightness and signal intensity ; here it was found that functional YFP - Bud9p constructs produced much clearer signals in the Σ 1287b strain background than the GFP - Bud9p fusion . It was possible to observe the chimeric protein with much higher frequency ( up to 40 % of stained cells ) at the proximal pole of unbudded cells and at the mother - bud neck of large - budded cells . This localization pattern of Bud9p in the Σ 1287b background is in much better agreement with the one observed in an alternative strain background and , therefore , is more consistent with the presumption of Bud9p being a landmark protein for the proximal pole . Thus , the experiments using YFP - Bud9p constructs appear to be sufficiently suited to identify putative localization signals in Bud9p , even though the reason for the additional tip localization of Bud9p that was routinely observed in the Σ 1287b strain background is not known . Previous studies had been performed with yeast strains expressing only either GFP - Bud8p or GFP - Bud9p , which do not allow observing both proteins simultaneously in individual cells . In this study , Bud8p and Bud9p proteins were for the first time co - localized at different stages of the cell cycle ; these experiments confirm previous observations and refine the model on the polar localization of the two cortical tags during cell division ( Fig . 24 ) : In newborn cells , only Bud8p is localized at the distal cell pole . Bud9p appears exclusively at the proximal cell pole , excluding a negative regulation of Bud9p at the distal cell pole . Consequently , initiation of the first budding event in newborn cells occurs with a very high frequency at the distal pole because Bud8p is the more effective pole marker . During the following cell cycles , Bud9p starts to accumulate at the distal pole , leading to a partial inhibition of Bud8p at this site . As a consequence , the proximal budding frequency starts to increase until a bipolar budding pattern is established after three to four division cycles . This model presumes that Bud9p is delivered to the bud site very late during the cell cycle , which has been observed in a previous study showing that Bud9p appears at the cell surface after activation of the mitotic exit network and just before cytokinesis ( Schenkman et al . , 2002 ) . D ISCUSSION 88 Fig . 24 : Distribution of Bud8p and Bud9p during the cell cycle . The figure shows a schematic model of the distribution of Bud8p and Bud9p at the distal and the proximal cell pole during the budding process . During the first cell cycle Bud8p can be localized at the distal pole . It is assumed that inhibition of the distal pole budding does not occur because Bud9p is localized during the first cell cycle exclusively at the proximal pole . From the beginning of the second cycle Bud9p begins to accumulate also at the distal pole of the mother cell , so that a negative regulation of Bud8p by Bud9p at the distal pole allows budding at the proximal pole . ' M ' signifies the mother cell , ' D ' the daughter cell . In summary , the co - localization experiments performed in this work provide an explanation for the long - known observations that the first budding events in newborn diploid daughter cells occur almost exclusively at the distal cell pole and that bipolar budding does not occur before several rounds of cell division . 4 . 2 Post - translational modification of Bud8p and Bud9p Previous studies have shown that Bud8p and Bud9p appear as multiple signals in Western blot experiments , suggesting a post - translational modification of both proteins . Typically , secreted and plasma membrane proteins are characterized by different features . For instance , most of them carry NH 2 - terminal sorting signals . Furthermore , the majority of these proteins D ISCUSSION 89 are glycoproteins . The addition of oligosaccharides occurs by N - linked and / or O - linked glycosylation , and it is necessary for proper folding of the proteins . The fact that both Bud8p and Bud9p carry multiple N - and O - glycosylation sites indicates that they might be delivered by the secretory pathway to their point of action , albeit they do not contain classical ER signal sequences ( Harkins et al . , 2001 ) . The results of this study’s pulse - chase experiments provide further evidence for a post - translational modification of Bud8p and Bud9p . In both cases , a shift in the molecular weight can be observed within approximately one hour after protein synthesis . Interestingly , these obtained results indicate that synthesis of Bud8p and Bud9p occurs very slowly . For comparison , in an early study it was shown that the secretion of the yeast invertase Suc2p appears very rapid by demonstrating that completion of its export requires not more than 5 min ( Novick et al . , 1981 ) . Another protein , whose secretion has been studied in detail , is for instance the vacuolar enzyme carboxypeptidase Y ( CPY ) . Also for this protein , processing and transport by the secretion machinery occurs with a half - time of approximately six minutes ( Hasilik and Tanner , 1978 ; Schekman , 1985 ) . First hints on the transport of both proteins were gained in this study by pulse chase experiments with a sec18 - 1 mutant strain that is blocked for the transport of a number of proteins through the secretory pathway ( H . - D . Schmitt , personal communication ) . As , however , an increase in the molecular weight of both Bud8p and Bud9p was evident in such a sec18 ts mutant strain , the proteins might be transported to the cell surface through the secretory pathway by a SEC18 - independent mechanism . Classical studies of temperature - sensitive secretory ( sec ) mutants conclude that the majority of secreted and plasma membrane proteins follow a common SEC pathway via the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , Golgi apparatus , and secretory vesicles to the cell periphery . Yet recently , it could be shown that the yeast integral membrane protein Ist2p travels from the ER to the plasma membrane via a novel route that operates independently from the formation of the coat - protein complex II ( COPII ) - coated vesicles ( Jüschke et al . , 2005 ) . The study yielded that the COOH - terminal domain of Ist2p comprises all the necessary information for the targeting of Ist2p ( and other integral membrane proteins ) to the plasma membrane in a SEC18 - independent manner , defining it as a novel sorting determinant . The only requirements for sorting to the plasma membrane are the presence of upstream hydrophobic domains , which mediate the integration of the polypeptide into the ER membrane , and a topology that confers a cytosolic orientation of this domain ( Jüschke et al . , 2005 ) . To yield additional information on post - translational D ISCUSSION 90 modifications of Bud8p and Bud9p , further strains must be tested in pulse - chase experiments employing additional sec mutants or other mutants in , e . g . , various signalling pathways to study glycosylation of these cortical tags . 4 . 3 Functional domains of Bud8p and Bud9p With the exception of the predicted COOH - terminal transmembrane segments , Bud8p and Bud9p lack any known functional domains . In order to identify regions of these spatial landmark proteins , a detailed structural and functional analysis was performed here . One specific aim was to uncover regions that contain segments important for polar localization of the proteins and for mediating the interaction with the GDP / GTP exchange factor Bud5p as well as the cortical tag protein Rax1p . Systematic deletion sets of Bud8p and Bud9p were generated to achieve this aim . Previous studies had shown that in many cases this approach is promising to identify functional domains of poorly characterized proteins . Although deletion mutations bear a certain risk to create global alterations on protein conformation , many domains will fold properly if neighbouring sequences are removed or even if isolated from their natural context . In addition , deletions that affect only a subset of the properties of the full - length protein are likely to define functional domains . In this study , the construction of suitable deletion sets led to uncovering of such mutations within Bud8p and Bud9p , indicating that the omitted regions carry domains with specific functions and therefore validating the approach . The results of this study show that deletions at the NH 2 - terminus of Bud8p ( residues 7 - 216 ) and Bud9p ( residues 8 - 218 ) influence neither the correct localization of the proteins at the cell poles nor their function . Corresponding deletion proteins localize to the cell poles , and the mutant strains are not conspicuous with respect to their budding pattern . These results indicate that the equivalent segments do not carry any transport signals , because proteins are released to their site of action where they are able to fulfil their function as pole marker . The prediction that deletions in this part do not affect localization and / or function agrees with the fact that classical NH 2 - terminal signal sequences are absent in the amino acid sequences of Bud8p and Bud9p . As mentioned above , the results of the structure - function analyses indicate that the NH 2 - terminal part does not play a role in correct localization or function of Bud8p and Bud9p . Accordingly , it is assumed that segments that are involved in the transport of Bud8p D ISCUSSION 91 and Bud9p can be found in the median and COOH - terminal part , respectively : Deletions in these parts of the proteins hamper correct localization , indicating that signals for transport to the cell surface and / or the cell poles are encoded in these regions . In case of Bud8p , deletions in either the median or the COOH - terminal part correlated with two distinct mislocalization patterns . Mutant proteins deleted for portions of the median part are evenly distributed at the cell surface , indicating that they are either randomly delivered to the plasma membrane or diffuse freely in the membrane after polar delivery . The data do not allow distinguishing between these two possibilities but they suggest that the median part of Bud8p does not carry sequences that are essential for cell surface delivery . Two mutations in the COOH - terminal part ( Δ 375 - 505 and Δ 513 - 600 ) cause Bud8p enrichment in the cytoplasm , indicating that the deleted segments could carry transport signals . It is noticeable that these proteins also appear frequently as patches that rapidly move within the cell . This observation might indicate that these variants get stuck during secretion to the cell surface at an unknown time point . Strikingly , the Δ 375 - 505 mutation also blocks interaction with Bud5p and Rax1p , which led to the assumption that this deletion could cause global structure alterations that generally affect properties of Bud8p . In contrast , the Δ 513 - 600 mutation does not influence the interaction with Bud5p and Rax1p , making it more likely that the observed localization defect is due to loss of a putative transport signal in the deleted region . Comparison of the deduced primary structure of both proteins showed that this part of Bud8p ( residues 513 - 600 ) displays a high degree of similarity to the corresponding segment of Bud9p ( residues 460 - 544 ) . In former studies with chimeric Bud8p / Bud9p proteins it could be shown that these portions of Bud8p and Bud9p carrying two transmembrane domains that are functionally interchangeable ( Schenkman et al . , 2002 ) ; thus , Bud8p and Bud9p might carry similar transport signals in their COOH - terminal regions . The finding that deletion of the Bud9p residues 460 to 544 also causes cytoplasmic localization strengthens this hypothesis . A number of further deletions were found to affect localization of Bud9p . Two deletions in the median part of the protein ( Δ 168 - 283 and Δ 244 - 369 ) caused Bud9p to become enriched in the cytoplasm . The Δ 168 - 283 deletion also abolished interaction with Bud5p and Rax1p , making a definite conclusion difficult . The Δ 244 - 369 deletion mutant was competent for binding to Bud5p and Rax1p , indicating that a specific rather than a global defect caused cytoplasmic staining , e . g . , due to loss of a sequence required for transport of Bud9p to the cell D ISCUSSION 92 surface . However , correct transport does not appear to be completely lost in this mutant , because a bipolar budding pattern was observed for approximately 50 % of mutant cells . Two mutant proteins ( Δ 323 - 450 and Δ 406 - 450 ) were non - functional and appeared as patches predominantly in small - budded cells . Both variants are still competent for interaction with Bud5p and Rax1p , indicating a more specific defect and not a global alteration of protein conformation . It is assumed that the transcription of both pole marker proteins is cell cycle - regulated and that the time of transcription plays an important role for correct localization of the proteins . Former studies showed in case of BUD9 , the abundance of mRNA peaks in late G1 , whereas delivery of Bud9p appears to be delayed , because the protein arrives at the bud site of the neck very late in the cell cycle - after activation of the mitotic exit network and just before cytokinesis ( Schenkman et al . , 2002 ) . Thus , the Δ 323 - 450 and Δ 406 - 450 proteins might lack a sequence that directs Bud9p to the bud neck after peak expression . It is puzzling that these proteins accumulate as patches predominantly in small - budded cells and not in large - budded cells . A possible explanation might be altered stability of these proteins at later stages of the cell cycle . Although the exact reason ( s ) for the defects caused by these mutations are currently unknown , it seems likely that the deleted segments carry sequences that are involved in correct delivery of Bud9p to the proximal pole of daughter cells . Although the NH 2 - terminal part of both Bud8p and Bud9p appears to play no role for transport to the cell poles and establishment of the bipolar budding pattern , this study revealed that deletions in this part of both proteins can specifically affect the association of both Bud8p and Bud9p with Bud5p but not with Rax1p . Two variants of Bud8p ( Bud8p Δ 74 - 216 ) and Bud9p ( Bud9p Δ 91 - 218 ) were uncovered that are not functional in vivo and not able to interact with the GDP / GTP exchange factor Bud5p . Therefore , it is likely that the NH 2 - terminal regions of both proteins contain a domain that mediates interaction with Bud5p to activate the general bud site selection machinery . It is noticeable that these regions of Bud8p and Bud9p carry a similar stretch of approximately 30 amino acids in length ; whether these particular stretches , that share 40 % identity in amino acid sequence , confer interaction with Bud5p remains to be determined . It has been suggested that Bud8p and Bud9p might interact with downstream components through the conserved short cytoplasmic loops that are located between the two cytoplasmic domains ( Harkins et al . , 2001 ) . The obtained results of this study do not confirm this hypothesis , as Bud8p and Bud9p variants lacking this region are able to interact with D ISCUSSION 93 Bud5p . Because the portions of Bud8p and Bud9p , which are presumably necessary for the interaction with the cytoplasmic exchange factor Bud5p , are predicted to point toward the extracellular space , it is more likely that the association between the landmark proteins and Bud5p is mediated by another , yet unknown factor . In former studies it was found that specific residues at the NH 2 - terminal part of Bud5p are involved in the interaction with the spatial landmark of the distal pole Bud8p to recruit Bud5p to the proper bud site ( Kang et al . , 2004b ) . The results of this study indicate that the same residues are necessary for interaction with Bud9p , suggesting that the same region of Bud5p is involved in recognition of the spatial cues . This finding is in good agreement with the fact that bud5 Δ cells carrying deletions of the NH 2 - terminal 70 residues of Bud5p show random budding in all cell types ( Kang et al . , 2004b ) . Taken together , these data indicate that extracellular segments of Bud8p and Bud9p could interact with the NH 2 - terminal portion of Bud5p via additional unknown factors ; the identities of these factors remain to be clarified in future studies . Because all mutant strains that produce proteins with deleted segments in the median part exhibited a random budding pattern , it might be assumed that the interaction between them and Bud5p is impaired . However , results of co - affinity - purifications showed that the median part does not appear to confer interaction with the general budding machinery , as deletions within this segment demonstrably do not block interaction with Bud5p . Instead , the mutations result in dominant random budding , which might be caused by the even distribution of mutant proteins on the plasma membrane . Consequently , the entire cell surface might be competent for Bud5p - binding , and subsequent budding events occur at random positions at the cell cortex . This study uncovered several Bud8p and Bud9p mutants defective for interaction with Rax1p . In case of Bud8p mutants , the Rax1p - binding defect did not correlate with specific defects in bud site selection , Bud8p localization , or interaction with Bud5p ( Table 6 , p . 81 ) . These data suggest that the Bud8p - Rax1p interaction is not essential for transport and functionality of Bud8p , a conclusion that is in agreement with the previous finding that GFP - Bud8p localization does not depend on Rax1p ( Kang et al . , 2004a ) . Thus , while it is interesting to note that several regions of Bud8p might participate in Rax1p - binding , the actual role of the Bud8p - Rax1p interaction remains elusive . For Bud9p , we observed a correlation between Rax1p - binding and transport of the protein to the cell surface , because D ISCUSSION 94 both deletions that strongly affect Rax1p binding ( Δ 168 - 283 or Δ 460 - 544 ) also caused cytoplasmic staining of Bud9p . As discussed above , the Δ 168 - 283 mutation results in pleiotrophic defects , hampering a clear interpretation . However , in case of the Δ 460 - 544 mutant , which is competent for interaction with Bud5p , loss of Rax1p - binding might be one of the causes for mislocalization of Bud9p . This interpretation would be in agreement with the previous finding that deletion of Rax1p causes Bud9p to become mislocalized ( Kang et al . , 2004b ) . 4 . 4 Résumé In conclusion , the accomplishment of structure - function analyses of Bud8p and Bud9p has defined domains for both proteins that ( i ) seem to be involved in delivery of the proteins to the cell surface and to polar sites , ( ii ) that are likely to confer interaction with components of the general budding machinery and ( iii ) that appear to mediate interaction with other components of the bipolar landmarks ( Fig . 25 ) . As such , the study aids in extending the still limited knowledge on structure and function of these cortical tag proteins and helps to better understand how these transmembrane glycoproteins participate in spatial control of cell division . Unfortunately , it is not possible in all cases to explain the observed phenotype or combinations of different phenotypes within one mutant in detail . This might be put back to the fact that this investigation of poorly characterized proteins using systematic deletion sets bears a risk of creating global alterations of protein conformation . In this case domains are not able to fold properly because neighbouring sequences are removed from their natural context . In addition , deletions that affect only a subset of the properties of the full - length protein are likely to define functional domains . Generation of deletion sets led to uncovering of such mutations within Bud8p and Bud9p indicating that the deleted regions carry domains with specific functions and that our approach was successful . Future studies will have to address specific partners interacting with these domains of the spatial landmarks in a stable or transient manner . Furthermore , detailed biochemical studies must resolve temporal and spatial interactions between Bud8p and Bud9p and their associated partners . D ISCUSSION 95 Fig . 25 : Model for functional domains of Bud8p and Bud9p . Both proteins are drawn schematically as bars with NH 2 - terminal ( N ) and COOH - terminal ( C ) halves shown on the left and right , respectively . TM1 and TM2 designate the two putative transmembrane domains of each protein . Regions that were identified to be necessary for proper function are drawn as rectangles with the corresponding functions of these domains noted on the right hand side . To conclude , the aim of this study was to shed light on the molecular mechanisms that determine a fundamental feature of a simple single - celled eukaryote . Polarity , i . e . the anisotropic expression of cellular characteristics is a crucial trait especially for unicellular microorganisms in order to respond to external signals or environmental changes . The baker ' s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a well - suited model system to study such cellular qualities as it shows various but defined patterns of budding that depend on specific external conditions . Several genetic determinants necessary for this cellular program could be identified in the past , and in this study two spatial landmark proteins were characterized with respect to their cellular function . The approach chosen to do so , the generation of a comprehensive set of deletion mutants , proved to be valid as well as fruitful , as it gained novel information about the structure - function relationship of these polar markers . Moreover , by clarifying localizations and interactions of the mutant proteins with components of a polarity signalling module , further insights into this cellular process were obtained . First steps to investigate a potential role of ( polarized ? ) secretion of both cortical tag factors top this study off , and it is desirable that future studies will that might be built up on these data will contribute to our understanding how cells in general progress in a three - dimensional context . 96 5 .

An dieser Stelle möchte ich mich bei allen bedanken , die mich bei der Erstellung dieser Arbeit unterstützt haben . Hier ist zunächst Professor Dr . Hans - Ulrich Mösch zu nennen für die Möglichkeit , meine Doktorarbeit in seiner Abteilung anzufertigen . Ein Dankeschön gebührt auch Professor Dr . Gerhard H . Braus , der sich kurzfristig bereit erklärt hat , das Korreferat dieser Arbeit zu übernehmen . Bei meinen fleißigen Helfern David Löper und Inken Wollenweber möchte ich mich herzlich für die Ergebnisse ihrer Diplomarbeiten bedanken . Diese waren entscheidend für die Aufklärung vieler Fragen und haben damit maßgeblich zum Gelingen dieser Arbeit beigetragen . Während meiner Zeit in Göttingen ist mir Maria Meyer eine große Hilfe gewesen . Maria hat sich nicht nur dadurch ausgezeichnet , dass sie mich in verschiedenen Phasen meiner Promotion tatkräftig unterstützt hat , sondern auch dadurch , dass sie mir den manchmal " grauen " Laboralltag mit Campingwecken und Geschichten von Berti , Pauline und Hannelore versüßt hat . Bei Dr . Hans - Dieter Schmitt möchte ich mich für seine Unterstützung bei der Durchführung der pulse - chase - Experimente bedanken - ohne ihn wären diese wohl nie zustande gekommen . Beeindruckt war ich von seiner spontanen Hilfe , die er mir kurz vor dem Abgabetermin dieser Arbeit gewährt hat - Danke dafür ! Ein weiteres Dankeschön geht an meine „Mitdenker“ , mit denen ich in vielen Stunden über die Tücken der Molekularbiologie diskutiert habe , die mich oft aber auch einfach nur auf andere , „forschungsfremde“ Gedanken gebracht haben . Vor allem einigen ehemaligen Kollegen sei an dieser Stelle gedankt : Claudia , Katrin , Patrick , Britta und Malte , es war eine tolle Zeit ! Ole danke ich für kritische Diskussionen , die wir während meiner Doktorarbeit mehr als einmal miteinander geführt haben . Nicht zu vergessen ist Gaby , die immer ein offenes Ohr für mich hatte : Danke dafür ! Neben den Göttingern gab es auch in Marburg einige Menschen , die zum Gelingen dieser Doktorarbeit beigetragen haben . Ein großer Dank gilt hier der Arbeitsgruppe von Professorin Dr . Regine Kahmann am MPI FÜR TERRESTRISCHE M IKROBIOLOGIE und der Arbeitsgruppe von Professor Dr . Michael Bölker am Fachbereich Biologie der P HILIPPS - U NIVERSITÄT ; beide haben ein molekularbiologisches Arbeiten in Marburg überhaupt erst möglich gemacht . Ein besonderes Dankeschön möchte ich an dieser Stelle Volker Vincon und Nicole Rössel aussprechen , die mich und meine Mitstreiter auf besonders freundliche und umsichtige Art und Weise am Marburger MPI eingeführt haben . Diana Kruhl danke ich für ihre Unterstützung bei diversen praktischen Laborarbeiten . Danke auch meinen lieben Marburger Laborkollegen Reinhard Böcher und Hanne Moll : ich habe mich bei Euch sehr wohl gefühlt ! Bei Steffi Lindow , Petra Mann und Lucia Forzi möchte ich mich für ihre angenehme Gesellschaft und ihre lieben ( Petra , Lucia ) und direkten ( Steffi ) Worte während mancher Kaffeepause bedanken , schön war ' s ! In der Riege der Kollegen , die mir während meiner Zeit in Göttingen und Marburg besonders an Herz gewachsen sind , sind Melanie und Stefan einzureihen . Ich danke Euch für die vielen anregenden Diskussionen und dafür , dass ich den Forschungsalltag gemeinsam mit Euch meistern durfte . Unvergessen werden die zahlreichen , gemütlichen Abende mit Euch beim Essen , beim Bowling oder im Kino sein . Ohne Euch wäre die Zeit nicht einmal halb so erträglich gewesen . Euch beiden Danke für alles ! Nicht vergessen möchte ich ein Dankeschön für meine treue Weggefährtin Sonja , mit der mich das vor 10 Jahren begonnene Biologiestudium in Göttingen verbindet und eine genauso lange währende Freundschaft . Meinen Eltern und meinen Geschwistern kann ich gar nicht genug für ihre moralische Unterstützung und ihre aufmunternden Worte während meines Studiums und vor allem während des letzten Jahres danken . Es ist schön zu wissen , dass ihr mir vertraut und dass ich mich auf Euch verlassen kann ! Klein - Jonah möchte ich danken , dass er sich ganz heimlich in mein Leben geschlichen hat und damit den praktischen Arbeiten auf unkonventionelle Weise ein Ende gesetzt hat . Ein Leben ohne ihn kann und möchte ich mir nicht mehr vorstellen ! Mein allergrößter Dank gebührt Sven , der mit mir alle Höhen und Tiefen dieser Arbeit durchlebt hat . Ohne ihn wäre diese Arbeit so nie zustande gekommen . Ich danke Dir dafür , dass Du mit mir diese Zeit durchgestanden hast und immer für mich da gewesen bist ! 111 Curriculum Vitae Name : Anne - Brit Krappmann ( geb .
