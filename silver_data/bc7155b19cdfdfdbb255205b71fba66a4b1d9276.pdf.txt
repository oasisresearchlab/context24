Glyceraldehyde - 3 - Phosphate Dehydrogenase of Streptococcus pneumoniae Is a Surface - Displayed Plasminogen - Binding Protein Simone Bergmann , 1 Manfred Rohde , 2 and Sven Hammerschmidt 1 * Research Center for Infectious Diseases , University of Wu¨rzburg , Wu¨rzburg , 1 and GBF - German Research Centre for Biotechnology , Braunschweig , 2 Germany Received 18 August 2003 / Returned for modiﬁcation 7 November 2003 / Accepted 22 December 2003 The recruitment of plasminogen endows the bacterial cell surface of Streptococcus pneumoniae with proteo - lytic activity . In this study we demonstrate speciﬁc plasmin - and plasminogen - binding activity for the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) , which is located in the cytoplasm as well as on the surface of pneumococci . GAPDH exhibits a high afﬁnity for plasmin and a signiﬁcantly lower afﬁnity for plasminogen . A prerequisite for the invasiveness of a pathogen is the pathogen’s ability to breach epithelial as well as endothelial barriers in order to gain access to the submucosa and blood . A successful strategy used by pathogenic bacteria to degrade the extracellular matrix and to promote invasiveness is the recruit - ment of proteolytic activity to the bacterial cell surface ( 19 , 21 ) . Streptococcus pneumoniae , a common etiologic agent of respi - ratory tract diseases and life - threatening invasive diseases , is able to capture plasminogen on the bacterial cell surface . Sub - sequent activation by tissue - type and urokinase - type eukary - otic plasminogen activators allows the bacteria to acquire sur - face - associated proteolytic activity ( 10 , 17 ) . Plasminogen , a glycoprotein , is the zymogen of the serine protease plasmin , which is a key enzyme of the ﬁbrinolytic pathway ( 7 ) . The acquired plasmin activity promotes dissemination and transmi - gration of the pathogen through reconstituted basement mem - branes ( 6 , 10 , 21 ) . Analysis of plasminogen binding to viable pneumococci by the method described by Scatchard ( 25 ) indicated the presence of more than one plasminogen receptor on the pneumococcal cell surface . A blot overlay with soluble radioiodinated human plasminogen showed binding to eight pneumococcal compo - nents ( 2 ) . (cid:2) - Enolase ( Eno ) was identiﬁed as the major plas - minogen - and plasmin - binding protein of S . pneumoniae ( 2 ) . A further peptide sequence , obtained by an N - terminal sequence analysis of excised proteins positive for plasminogen binding , showed 100 % homology to the N - terminal sequence of glyc - eraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ; GapA ) in S . pneumoniae strains ( http : / / www . tigr . org / tigr - scripts / CMR2 / CMRGenomes . spl ) ( 16 , 26 ) . These results identiﬁed the GAPDH of S . pneumoniae , which is an essential enzyme of the glycolytic pathway , as a putative plasminogen - binding protein . For expression cloning of gapA , the gene was ampliﬁed by PCR using the chromosomal DNA of S . pneumoniae serotype 2 ( ATCC 11733 ) and oligonucleotide primers SB 13 ( 5 (cid:3) - GGAT CCTTGCTTGCACACTTGTTGAAATAC - 3 (cid:3) ) , incorporating an in - frame BamHI restriction site at the 5 (cid:3) end , and SB 14 ( 5 (cid:3) - AAGCTTTTATTTAGCAATTTTTGCGAAGTATT - 3 (cid:3) ) , incorporating an in - frame HindIII restriction site at the 3 (cid:3) end . The BamHI - and HindIII - digested PCR product was cloned into the similarly digested expression vector pQE30 ( Qiagen ) . The puriﬁcation of His - tagged GAPDH under native condi - tions was conducted according to a standard protocol ( Qia - gen ) . In order to identify the subcellular localization of GAPDH by immunoblot analysis , polyclonal antibodies against puriﬁed recombinant GAPDH were raised in rabbits by rou - tine immunogenic procedures ( Eurogentec ) . Results indicated the presence of GAPDH in both the cytoplasmic fraction and the cell surface protein fraction of S . pneumoniae ( Fig . 1 ) . A sequence comparison performed with the algorithm of Lipman and Pearson ( 18 ) revealed 89 . 0 % identity to the group A strep - tococcal GAPDH Plr / streptococcal surface dehydrogenase and 85 . 2 % identity to GapC in Streptococcus equisimilis ( 14 , 20 , 24 ) . Plasminogen - and plasmin - binding activity , which is most likely mediated via C - terminal lysyl residues ( 28 ) , to both streptococcal proteins has been reported . The pneumococcal GAPDH contains two C - terminal lysine amino acids which are separated by isoleucine and alanine . The C - terminal sequences ( (cid:4) 40 amino acids ) of the above - mentioned GAPDH proteins are 100 % identical . Moreover , sequence comparison revealed identical C termini in the GAPDHs of Streptococcus agalactiae , * Corresponding author .

Interestingly , the GAPDHs of streptococci of groups A , C , and G were recently identiﬁed as extracellular targets for a broad spectrum of extracellular matrix proteins and especially for plasmin and plasminogen ( 20 , 22 ) . In order to demonstrate the plasminogen - binding activity of the pneumococcal GAPDH , total proteins of the serotype 2 strain and the serotype 2 eno internal deletion ( eno int / del ) mu - tant were incubated with immobilized plasminogen . The mu - tant expresses an (cid:2) - enolase with a deletion of the C - terminal lysyl residues and amino acid substitutions in the internal plas - minogen - binding motif of Eno . The Eno int / del mutant exhibited substantially reduced plasminogen - binding activity ( 3 ) and was used in order to avoid binding of the (cid:2) - enolase to plasmino - gen . Plasminogen ( obtained from Sigma or provided by K . Preissner , Giessen , Germany ) was immobilized on a polyviny - lidine ﬂuoride membrane , and GAPDH binding was detected with polyclonal anti - GAPDH antiserum followed by horserad - ish peroxidase - conjugated anti - rabbit antibody . Results dem - onstrated a concentration - dependent GAPDH - plasminogen interaction , in which the protein - protein interaction depends on both the amount of immobilized plasminogen and the amount of soluble GAPDH ( Fig . 2 ) . In an attempt to visualize the subcellular localization of GAPDH and the binding of plasminogen to GAPDH protein , preembedding , labeling studies were carried out as recently demonstrated for Eno ( 2 ) . The unencapsulated pneumococcal strain R6x and the encapsulated pneumococcal strains of se - rotypes 2 ( ATCC 11733 ) and 35A ( NCTC 10319 ) were prela - beled with polyclonal protein A - puriﬁed anti - GAPDH immu - noglobulin G and 15 - nm - diameter gold particles coupled to protein A before embedding . Ultrathin sections revealed that the GAPDH of S . pneumoniae resembles the (cid:2) - enolase located on the bacterial cell surface of unencapsulated ( Fig . 3B ) and encapsulated ( Fig . 3A and C ) strains . These results indicate that the common surface disposition of GAPDH is indepen - dent of the state of capsular polysaccharide expression . The surface - located glycolytic enzymes of the Embden - Meyerhof - Parnas pathway and other surface - displayed proteins like PavA of S . pneumoniae ( 15 ) and FBP54 of Streptococcus pyogenes ( 8 , 9 ) lack the classical secretion and anchoring mechanisms ( 11 , 12 , 27 , 29 ) and thus constitute a novel class of exported pro - teins of gram - positive bacteria ( 5 ) . The conditions and factors required for protein secretion , as well as the mechanism of anchoring these proteins , are not known . How plasminogen is bound to GAPDH or Eno through the capsule also remains unknown . The dynamics of GAPDH - plasminogen and GAPDH - plas - min complex formation and their dissociation were analyzed by surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) technique . GAPDH was covalently immobilized on a BIAcore CM5 sensor chip as previously described ( 3 , 23 ) . The association and dissociation kinetics of Glu - plasminogen and plasmin ( Sigma ) to GAPDH were evaluated according to the heterogeneous ligand model ( A (cid:1) B1 7 AB1 ; A (cid:1) B2 7 AB2 ) . This revealed two equi - librium constants ; for plasminogen , K D1 was equal to 4 . 3 (cid:5) 10 (cid:6) 7 M and K D2 was equal to 1 . 6 (cid:5) 10 (cid:6) 10 M , and for plasmin , K D1 was equal to 2 . 8 (cid:5) 10 (cid:6) 8 M and K D2 was equal to 5 . 2 (cid:5) 10 (cid:6) 8 M . Studies using SPR showed that the pneumococcal GAPDH had a higher afﬁnity for the serine protease plasmin than for its zymogen plasminogen ( Fig . 4 ) , as has also been shown previously for the Plr / streptococcal surface dehydroge - nase of group A streptococci ( 20 ) .

The interaction of GAPDH and plasminogen produced lower equilibrium constants than the Eno - plasminogen dissociation and complex formation did ( K D1 , 8 . 6 (cid:5) 10 (cid:6) 8 M ; K D2 , 5 . 5 (cid:5) 10 (cid:6) 10 M ) in S . pneumoniae ( 3 ) , indicating a lower afﬁnity of GAPDH for plasminogen . Patho - genic bacteria acquire proteolytic activity by the recruitment and subsequent activation of plasminogen . A recent study in - dicated that the nonglycolytic property of (cid:2) - enolase contrib - utes to the pathogenesis of pneumococci ( 3 ) . The concerted action of both (cid:2) - enolase and GAPDH on the bacterial cell surface might , therefore , result in an enhancement of the pathogen’s ability to degrade the extracellular matrix and to invade host tissues .
