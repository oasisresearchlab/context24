Resistant and remediating design John Knight Arts , Design and Architecture , Aalto University , Tarporley , UK ABSTRACT Little is known about designers ’ experience in fast - paced sprint work . This article draws on case work research within consulting and in - house design teams that sheds light on this important topic . The findings indicated differences in digital designers ’ practices and occupational experiences . Designers reported stress in working in extreme agile deliv - ery teams and struggles in maintaining design integrity in scrum development . Resilience strategies that habituate designers in work contexts were also identified from the research . These stratagems combined remediating methods together with principled practitioner resistance . In the final inquiry , fifty - seven participants from in - house and consult - ing design teams were surveyed . The results indicated sig - nificant differences between the cohorts including higher levels of job satisfaction for consultants . This group also applied the remediating practices and positive resistance strategies to a greater extent than their in - house peers . These differences suggest that the occupational context of design is a fundamental influence on real world practice . KEYWORDS Digital design , design economy , agile , service design , design methods , occupation , agency Introduction Studies of consulting and in - house design teams are rare . Bj € orklund and van der Marel ( 2019 ) concluded that , to understand the digital design sector , ‘ research [ needs ] to take an organizationally situated perspective to design ’ ( Bj € orklund and van der Marel 2019 , 754 ) . Notable examples of an occupa - tional stance include those presented by Mayer - Ahuja and Wolf ( 2007 ) and by McKinlay and Smith ( 2010 ) . These early explorations examined design embedded in digital product and service production . In the past decade , this domain has undergone exponential growth , driven by agile development . Agile development ( Beck et al . 2001 ) , augmented by design operations , ena - bles organizations to digitally transform their operations .

Agile development is mature , widely adopted and delivers many benefits ( Senapathi and Srinivasan 2012 ) . Increased quality and efficiency , as well as reduced production costs and code errors , are some credible gains reported in the related literature ( see Kahkonen 2004 ; McInerney and Maurer 2005 ; Rodr (cid:2) ı guez et al . 2012 ) . Impressive increased team performance , productivity and output have been reported ( Federoff and Courage 2009 ) . The agile advantage comes at a cost . Methodological issues identified in early research ( e . g . Nerur , Mahapatra , and Mangalaraj 2005 ) have persisted through to recent studies ( Dingsøyr et al . 2023 ) . Well - documented challenges include accumulating technical debt ( Lindskog and Magnusson 2021 ) , sprint - task sequencing difficulties ( Persson et al . 2018 ) and ineffective decision - mak - ing stalling team productivity ( McAvoy and Butler 2009 ) . In good conditions , high - performing teams deliver at velocity . However , many factors dissipate the positive potential of agile delivery . The reality can often be chaotic ( Rigby , Elk , and Berez 2020 ) rather than high - performance collaboration . Problems proliferate with the scale needed to deliver transformational projects ( Gulliksen Stray , Moe , and Dingsøyr 2011 ) that require many ( > 10 ) sprint teams . Decision - making in agile work is highly distributed , often impeding strategic value realization ( Moe et al . 2021 ) in critical areas such as time to market and product differentiation . Dependencies grow exponentially with each additional sprint team in scaled agile . This pervasive problem is exacerbated as ‘ there is no leader who can deal with conflicts ’ ( Lindsjørn et al . 2016 , 281 ) . Lack of leadership results in ambiguity that aggravates interpersonal conflicts ( Sekitoleko et al . 2014 ) and detriments well - being ( Conboy et al . 2011 ) . Lastly , agile ’ s founda - tional practice of autonomous working can similarly inflame cross - team ten - sions , increasing individuals ’ self - regulation efforts , causing fatigue and stress ( Mueller and Benlian 2022 ) . Designers ’ role in agile production is varied , often challenging and highly contingent on the host organization ’ s production methods ( as can be seen in participant verbatims below ) . Agile design ranges from working in small teams using shared - task ticketing through to extreme , scaled agile involving tens of sprint teams . On the positive side , sprint - based working can give designers increased individ - ual agency ( Knight 2022 ) . Seeing work ‘ go live ’ quickly , ‘ just doing the work ’ 1 and the camaraderie of close collaboration teams are some of the positive aspects . Bj € orklund and van der Marel reported on designers ’ positive job satisfac - tion ( Bj € orklund and van der Marel , 2019 , 765 ) , even in these often intense working conditions . They also noted differences between consultants ’ and in - house practitioners ’ experiences ( Bj € orklund and van der Marel 2019 , 763 THE DESIGN JOURNAL 605 and 759 ) . Variations in designers ’ occupational experiences are common , 2 arguably due to factors that go beyond differences in modes of employment . Designers face many difficulties in agile . They are often assigned to mul - tiple scrum teams ( Jurca , Hellmann , and Maurer 2018 , 28 ) , and they can experience marginalization ( Cajander , Larusdottir , and Geiser 2022 , 2 ) , disem - powerment ( Schell and O ’ Brien 2015 , 225 and xi ) and identity issues ( Rosenberg 2014 , 75 ) . Digital designers deal with endemic agile issues and other issues specific to their practice . Many factors reduce designers ’ ability to maintain profes - sional integrity and derive personal meaningfulness in intense production work . Time pressure is a critical factor that leads teams to cut down design activities ( Dayton and Barnum 2009 ) to meet sprint goals . Higher - value cre - ative work is often deprioritized in favour of piecemeal ( Ferreira 2012 ) quick wins that ‘ feed the agile beast ’ . 3 Senior designers ’ authority and ability to craft their practice can be thwarted in these kinds of ‘ dev - led ’ cultures . 4 Tasked with delivering ‘ slice - of - value ’ increments , they are often diverted from positioning their practice at a more strategic level . These factors affect job satisfaction . The ratio of satisfying flow - type work ( Jonsson and Persson 2006 ) is low compared with mundane ‘ small - change ’ work ( 80 % ) 5 that takes up the bulk of working time . Unlike other pod mem - bers , designers commonly work in multiple sprint teams , carrying out many small tasks ; this causes constant context switching . Chaotic middling projects often lack organizational alignment and structure , which contributes to reworking taking up half of designers ’ working time in these kinds of projects . 6 Potential methods for improving integration are well researched ( see , e . g . Jurca , Hellmann , and Maurer 2018 ) . However , their effectiveness is less evi - dent . Dybå and Dingsøyr ( 2008 , 841 ) found that most ( 39 % ) were based on single cases . Najafi and Toyoshiba ( 2008 ) and Kuusinen et al . ( 2016 ) are not - able exceptions in basing recommendations on longitudinal , multiple case studies . Similarly , Kollmann , Sharp , and Blandford ( 2009 ) combine interviews with some ‘ shadowing ’ to substantiate their recommendation of improving visioning and co - working . Hoda , Noble , and Marshall ( 2012 ) took these two approaches further and used grounded theory in their analysis . Dingsøyr et al . ( 2023 ) argued that there is an ‘ urgent need for more studies involving mature agile development teams ’ ( Hoda , Noble , and Marshall 2012 , 1219 ) . Generally , methodological solutions are proposed to remedy these issues . Many researchers ( e . g . Peres et al . 2014 ) combine design and agile techni - ques into a single methods - based framework . The potential of such solutions is limited as they neglect practitioner agency in collaborative teamwork and 606 J . KNIGHT effective method use . A methodological approach that helps structure agile design work , augmented with the means to empower practitioners , ought to provide a more holistic solution . To address this , a mixed - methods approach was adopted in this research . This included case work , diary studies , surveys and experiments that gener - ated findings and habituating interventions including the Foundation prac - tice framework . Discovery research A sizeable corpus was elicited through the research . This enabled thematic analysis and hypotheses building from utterances taken from studies across a variety of cohorts ( as shown in Table 1 ) . An early - stage participant self - reported on her work : The biggest stress in agile projects is [ that ] not everyone [ is ] marching to the same drum : the process is a mess … expectations are not aligned . ( Remediation issue ) I work on multiple projects at one time . The pace of sprints means that I am unable to complete the research part of my job . I ’ m lucky to get design work done . And the developers always want to move faster than the stories [ are ] planned . ( Remediation issue ) Since [ there are ] often changes to what will be worked on in the next sprint , it is easy to get behind . ( Remediation issue ) Table 1 . The research framework .

THE DESIGN JOURNAL 607 Designers fell behind development as they weren ’ t included in the cross - functional scrum team but were brought in on demand . ( Remediation issue ) Similarly , a designer noted that design can cause bottlenecks : Yes , this [ falling behind development work ] happens sometimes when the requirements change in the middle of the sprint , which in turn lengthens the design time and [ hinders ] gets it signed off . ( Remediation issue ) A senior designer reported on the dangers of an incremental focus including : There is a lack of emphasis on research and design . It ’ s all about shipping products . Not products with great experiences . ( Remediation issue ) Other comments allude to tensions and strategies to improve work , for example : The incessant planning and tracking … combined with the short - sightedness of solving a problem now , not the right problem tomorrow . ( Remediation issue ) Conversely , participants relished solving work problems and noted agile developments positive aspects : Getting things done quickly , focus , team alignment and energy , test and learn culture . Strong relationship with developers makes it easy to bring products to life . Understanding challenges and wrestling with the complexity in order to get to a decent solution . ( Resistant behaviour ) Leading with methods , process , and ideas ’ ( Resistant behaviour ) Definition research Working as a practitioner , the author was embedded in six design teams dur - ing the research . This research approach was taken for several reasons . Foremost was the need to dialogically identify and understand success fac - tors in digital design first - hand . This approach is also advantageous as it fol - lows the occupational principle of gaining understanding in order to make valuable habilitation and rehabilitation interventions . Firstly , an agency design team ( Case A ) was studied ( Knight 2017 ) as they moved from waterfall to agile . Consulting work ( Case B ) was then under - taken in the enterprise sector . Case work at Camelot ( Case C ) enabled first - hand observation of a team deeply embedded in dev - led production . This allowed thorough exploration of different project types and design roles ( see Knight 2019 ) . Returning to consultancy ( Case D ) service design work helped with identifying and trialing remediation interventions ( Knight , et al . 2020 , Knight et al . 2019 , 2020 ) . Lastly , two in - house teams ( Cases E and F ) with 608 J . KNIGHT mature design operations capabilities but in different sectors were explored . Insights gained from hands - on case work included identifying rework , the role of design systems ( Churchill 2019 ) and seniority differences in resistant behaviour . Interventions included end - to - end project work , such as work in planning , execution and supporting activities ( such as training , daily practi - tioner engagement and team surveys ) . The insider stance of this research aligns with classic work studies . These commonly involve observation ( e . g . Trist and Bamforth 1951 ) , narrative description ( e . g . Burawoy 1979 ) and inquiry ( Lawlor 2000 ) , participant obser - vation ( e . g . Tang 1991 ) and formal methods of data collection and analysis ( e . g . action research [ Levin 1934 , cited in Adelman 1993 ] ) . This research was looser , more recursive , and dialogically improved work through the work itself . Echoing agile principles ( Beck et al . 2001 ) , the work was the product , rather than the research being an end in itself . The field - work produced data ( fieldnotes and internal ‘ found ’ artefacts ) . These ephem - era marked moments of realization or epiphanies ( Ellis , Adams , and Bochner 2011 ) for further formal validation and were not concrete data points in themselves . While the somewhat unconventional research approach might have been improved with more structure , it proved effective in grounding the overall direction of insights within the field of inquiry being researched . Occupational experience The next stage of research involved recruiting 42 designers . Most were aged between 25 and 44 ( 82 % ) . The majority of respondents were female ( 62 % ) , and most were based in the UK ( 59 % ) . Some limitations arise in regard to the generalizability of the findings due to the self - selection approach of this recruitment . As the recruitment was undertaken during COVID - 19 , this was a pragmatic decision as many in - house and consulting designers had moved from co - located to remote team working . The participants kept a diary for four weeks . During this time , they were prompted to record their design tasks and how they felt at specific times during the working day . They added notes ( used in transcription ) and scored their feelings against a set of descriptors ( e . g . stressed to calm – see Table 2 ) when prompted . The findings helped define a framework mapping designers ’ occupational experience within eleven bi - polar facets ( see Table 2 ) . These results align and extend the framework of Wilcock et al . ( 1997 ) and Bj € orklund and van der Marel ’ s ( 2019 ) top and bottom moments with varying levels of fit . For example , autonomy , an innate need is allocated to authority in the frame - work . Likewise , knowing ( identified in this research ) is mapped with competency . THE DESIGN JOURNAL 609 The respondents also kept a reflective diary and co - wrote a five - act narra - tive . Using a shared digital workspace they developed characters , scripted events , and wrote the dialog for an imaginary agile design project . This ‘ Practitioners ’ Tale ’ describes the characters fluctuating fortunes in agile pro - duction work . The text records points of consensus and conflict . Situations when remediating methods were applied and where the designers resisted prevailing power relations are also detailed . Remediation problems generally arose from dealing with ambiguity , poor working practices , and a lack of structure . Resistant issues commonly occurred out of needing to challenge the direction of work : The designer gets frustrated when business analysts and product managers ignore his or her point of view on how to approach a problem because of his or her lack of knowledge of the business process and technical constraints . ( Resistant problem ) the client , referring back to what she or he signed off on and , at times , the design having to be changed causes delays to the go - live date and cause friction in the team due to pressure from senior staff . ( Resistant and remediating problem ) The product owner and product manager haven ’ t really gauged an understanding of why this is a problem to solve – they have just assembled the team and hope that it will ‘ figure it out ’ with little direction . ( Resistant and remediating problem ) [ in the agile world , sometimes designers do not have enough time to come up with great solutions . The team ends up delivering something good but not great . ( Remediation problem ) senior stakeholders and product owners have not [ bought ] into the research … design process , or they think research ‘ takes too long ’ . ( Remediation problem ) The intuitive and improvised nature of resistant design echoes the crucial role of practitioner agency that is noted in the related literature ( e . g . Buchanan 1992 ; Lawson 1979 ) . Remediating design , on the other hand , exemplifies the structured and methodical design strand found in the litera - ture ( e . g . Rittel [ see Krippendorff 2008 ] and Jones 1992 ) . However , this research cautions against dualist theories of design . Table 2 . Designers occupational experience framework .

KNIGHT The occupational standpoint suggests a more constructivist approach to designing . Resistance maps with Denis , Langley , and Rouleau ’ s pluralistic framing construct of ‘ spontaneity , creativity and imagination ’ ( 2007 ; cited in Bj € orklund and van der Marel 2019 , 756 ) , while remediating overlaps with the collective aspects of civic legitimization at the level of practice . Combining these strategies provides an outcome that is greater than the sum of its parts : it improves job satisfaction and design integrity . Designers are habituated through design work using structure and agency . Together , these offer creative ways to tackle ‘ wicked ’ design chal - lenges , and crucially , they also enable the designers to work their craft with success and integrity in difficult real - world contexts . This in turn accords with the occupational literature : work is contestable within the given power relations in any production domain . In this context every designer must find her or his way to thrive in chal - lenging conditions through a combination of grit , technique , and cunning . This can be difficult for new designers who are developing their own ways of working . Overtime , these personal strategies become second nature , ena - bling practitioners to shape their work to impose structure on ambiguity and promulgate design integrity with composure . Research findings in this study provide detail on designers ’ thriving strat - egies . These insights resonate with other knowledge - based work legitimiza - tion ( ibid . ) and habituation ( Rowles 2000 ) strategies . The study data was recursively coded and calculated to show the percent - age of data within four facets . The facet with lowest percentage of data ( 3 % ) covered the physical and mental capabilities needed to do design work . The next ( 7 % ) consisted of theoretical knowledge that connects day - to - day doing to an esteemed body of knowledge . This facet maps to Denis , Langley , and Rouleau ’ s construct of legitimization ( ibid . ) through tradition and hierarchy . The two top ranking facets comprised resistant - oriented ( 67 % ) and remediat - ing - oriented knowing ( 23 % ) . The first of these is highly personal and context dependent as it develops through an individual ’ s occupational experience ( as seen in Table 3 ) . The lat - ter is generalizable as it pertains to common routines , repertoires and meth - ods taken from cases and applied to work . Together these strategies enable practitioners to work with authority through codified practices and amplifies their agency to apply them masterfully . The findings suggest that two combined factors help practitioners thrive in agile and in design toplay a more dominant role vis - (cid:3) a - vis management and development . These comprise method - based structures and positive resistant ( McCabe , Ciuk , and Gilbert 2020 ) and productive resistant ( Courpasson , Dany , and Clegg 2012 ) behaviour , in accordance with the occu - pational literature . THE DESIGN JOURNAL 611 Remediating methods help harmonize design with agile by imposing a structure that enhances creative collaboration and fast - paced production . Resistant behaviour ranges from individual ‘ pushbacks ’ against compromise , promoting principled solutions , through to formal escalations that are pre - sented to management . How these factors work together is , however , beyond the scope of this research . While there is no silver bullet for every situation , the research points to generalizable ways of improving agile design . Specific remediating enhance - ments arise from a combination of the four ‘ D ’ methods ( see Figure 1 ) that form the proposed and validated foundation practice framework . Firstly , a lack of vision is addressed through collaborative service blueprinting ( method D1 ) . Method D2 centres on design thinking to aid cross - team know - ledge sharing and direction ( Adikari , McDonald , and Campbell 2013 ) . Meanwhile , design operations ( method D3 ) help designers integrate into continuous delivery . Lastly , method D4 mitigates risk through design research and legitimizes practice through aligning with human - centred design standards and methodologies . Table 3 .

Foundation practice framework . 612 J . KNIGHT Summative research design In the final inquiry , research questions surveyed practitioner resilience and success strategies in agile across internal and consulting contexts . The first set of questions aimed to extend understanding of how design work oper - ates in the two different kinds of organization as an indicator of remediating and resistant design . The second set of questions centred on occupational differences in the level of agency and tackled the practitioners ’ level of authority and autonomy . Questions about their future employment prospects were also tackled as markers of job satisfaction and value . The last set of questions focussed on levels of resistant and remediating design integration . Precise questions included questions about stakeholder relationships , requirements for quality , levels of ambiguity , method adoption , time utiliza - tion and levels of rework . Method The participants were recruited through a popular professional social media platform . Fifty - seven subjects were selected to complete an online question - naire . The cohort included 37 agency workers and 20 in - house respondents . The respondents had a majority of men in the in - house teams ( 74 % ) and a majority of women in the agencies ( 57 % ) . This recruitment approach intro - duced some limitations in sampling . Results Most of the respondents were between 25 and 34 years old . The agency cohort was relatively evenly spread age wise , forming a discernible pyramid with a minority of elders . The salaried cohort formed a rough bell - curve dis - tribution of age . Tenure was less evenly spread . The consultancy cohort had more senior practitioners with over 10 years ’ experience in the role . The in - house group was distinctive in having designers with under four years ’ experience . Seniority differed significantly at mid - weight level , with the in - house popula - tion ( 82 % ) far exceeding the consultants ( 18 % ) . Overall , the findings show a positive ( . 99 ) correlation and significant differ - ence between salaried designers and agency designers across all the survey questions ( as shown in the study population correlation data , displayed in Table 4 ) . This was calculated from the mean of all data points across populations . Design work is distinctly different in the two contexts . Overall , consultants apply the foundation practices more fully and with greater strategic focus than in - house designers ( see Figure 2 ) . Integrating design and research into THE DESIGN JOURNAL 613 this cohesive framework helps align incremental , tactical and transform - ational types of work and improve job satisfaction . The two groups remediating practices were slightly different . Service design was reported as more widely adopted by the consultants in the data . This strategic marker suggests they do more rewarding and impactful work . Unsurprisingly , design operations ranked higher for in - house respondents , suggesting a strong production orientation to their work . Similarly , the higher ranking of design thinking suggests that stakeholder collaboration is more challenging in - house . The consultants ’ positive responses are reflected in significant differences in improvised work shown in Figure 3 . These findings also suggest in - house designers have less control over the direction of projects and weaker author - ity to mandate how they do the work compared to consultants . This in turn diminishes their individual autonomy and may explain the differences in job satisfaction between the two cohorts . The two groups diverged on assimilation levels within their host organiza - tions . Surprisingly , the data suggests consultants are more deeply integrated Table 4 .

External designers reported nearly double ( 62 % ) the level of integration compared to their in - house peers ( 26 % ) . Employee satisfaction ( measured by standardized Employee Net Promoter Score ) data indicated a clear advantage for the consultants . These designers ’ responses suggest they have stronger growth and career opportunities and apply foundation practices more fully than the in - house group . Similarly , the external group reported higher levels of relatedness and autonomy as well as having greater clarity , better quality requirements and less stress com - pared to their in - house peers ( as seen in Figure 4 ) . Across the two populations , learning through doing was paramount . Second was education through working with others , and someway distant , came formal and self - directed learning ( as seen in Figure 5 ) . This suggests that habituation is an outcome of occupation itself rather than being a pre - requisite for it . Design is learnt through a complex interaction of using meth - ods , delivering project work , collaborating with peers and developing personal resistant strategies . The data indicates consultants benefit from strong portfolios , suggesting their work merits attention . Project variety and the proximity of senior practi - tioners suggests strong , supportive and inclusive cultures for the consultants as seen in Figure 6 . This cohort also benefits from learning within a wider variety of project types , across differing sectors , and from a more design - dominant working culture . 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Self structuring Applying methods Controling direc(cid:2)on Improvising work In - house Consultants Figure 3 .

This kind of work is arguably more rewarding than production activities and certainly less constrained and protracted . Consultants benefit from positive client perceptions too . Status gained through affiliation with a creative agency or renowned technology consult - ancy can only enhance external designers ’ status and sense of coherence . There are some negatives to consulting design , however . Consulting designers rarely see their work in production . Changing clients regularly gives consultants variety but also means that they lack the strong relation - ships and connection with the product or service that their in - house peers enjoy . Conversely , internal teams face considerable challenges in gaining visi - bility at a tactical level and in gaining traction at a strategic level . This posi - tioning reduces their ability to influence the type of work they do and their opportunities to do rewarding , meaningful work . Similarities between the in - house workers and consultants centre on com - mon practices and learning preferences . For both groups , learning through doing is predominant . As methods are integral to doing , then it is plausible that they aid learning as they structure ambiguity into doable tasks with potential learning outcomes . Naturally , differences in projects ( e . g . regarding the technology stack , timelines etc . ) are contributing factors too . 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 In - house Consultants Figure 6 . Practitioners ’ habituation comparisons . THE DESIGN JOURNAL 617 The findings support the overarching finding of Bj € orklund and van der Marel ( 2019 , 760 ) regarding innate needs mapping with designers ’ top and bottom moments in work . Foremost among these is competency . There is a clear advantage for consulting designers in this regard , as well as opportuni - ties for autonomy and relatedness within work . Bj € orklund and van der Marel ( ibid . ) also highlighted the primacy of mean - ing in design work . From an occupational perspective , meaningful work ( Hammell 2004 ) gives individuals purpose , agency and knowledge . Consultants ’ chance of doing this kind of work is far greater than that of their in - house peers . However , these findings indicate that in - house design - ers ’ work is distinctly different from consulting designers , possibly because they are tightly integrated into a production - oriented servicing model . Conclusion The findings offer an important contribution to challenging dualist theories of design . Designers are habituated to tackle ‘ wicked ’ design challenges and crucially work their craft to model design integrity in multi - disciplinary teams tasked in difficult real - world contexts . This conclusion , based on practice - based research , indicates a strong divergence between the related literature and the realities of design work . The implications of this key finding are wide - ranging , spanning the theoretical foundations of design through to practical questions about apposite educational curricula . Contributions to practice emanating from this research include the foun - dation practice framework to remediate extreme digital production . This addresses the gap noted in the literature ( Hinderks et al . 2022 ) regarding the lack of an overarching framework with which to harmoniously integrate design and agile . As a practical , non - proscriptive framework , this solution aims to help habituate designers rather than constrain their individuality . In contrast to other integrative approaches , this research points to the importance of practitioner agency regarding , not only assuring design integ - rity through methodology , but also at the behavioural level of doing . Principled resistance against occupational imbalance and disciplinary degrad - ation is proposed as an important counterbalance that transcends methods . Methods correlate with knowledge ; they evolve through practice , from rote through to improvisation . Non - practitioners also develop knowledge about design through methods as they codify legitimate practice . The research methodology also contributes to practice . This includes spe - cific novel methods of doing fieldwork , including collaborative writing and the case - work approach itself . The latter provides rich insights into practice . Similarly , practitioner diary studies proved to be effective in compensating for the relatively ad hoc nature of the immersive fieldwork . Together these 618 J . KNIGHT two research methods help achieve a holistic account of practice , connecting emic and etic perspectives on the field of inquiry . A more structured approach to might build on the wider potential of this mixed - methods approach . These various modes of inquiry and the insightful data they produced were amplified by the overarching occupational perspective of this research . From this standpoint , work is much more than salaried time for designers . Design is the work as well as the resultant deliverable product or service . Occupational experience ( Håkansson , Dahlin - Ivanoff , and Sonn 2006 ) gives individuals meaning ( Hammell 2004 ) , agency and understanding of the world ( Filstad 2014 ) . These insights suggest that individual purpose is actualized through doing . In this research , positive resistant agency ( McCabe , Ciuk , and Gilbert 2020 ) and productive resistant agency ( Courpasson , Dany , and Clegg 2012 ) , combined with structuring methods , help make design work better . Lastly , this occupational standpoint closes the gap between research and intervention . Gaining more insight into this topic is perhaps the most challenging out - come to achieve . At the same time , it has potential to extend our under - standing of work in general , as well as our understanding of the possibilities for design to intervene in this critical field of human activity at an occupa - tional level . More formal validation would substantiate the claims made based on the final research inquiry results . Notes 1 . Knight ( 2023 ) , Studies A , B , and C . 2 . Knight ( 2019 ) , Studies D to J . 3 .
