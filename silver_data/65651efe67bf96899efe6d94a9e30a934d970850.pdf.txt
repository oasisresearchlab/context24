Under two different instruction conditions ( standard instruc - tion or explicit “be creative” instruction ) , students also took a battery of multi - item , product - based tests of creativity in three domains ( artistic , verbal , and mathematical creativity ) . Fac - tor analyses showed evidence of domain - generality of creativ - ity . Furthermore , results from structural equation models showed that motivational and personality traits and intellec - tual abilities were associated with the domain - general compo - nent of creativity . Only one variable ( SAT quantitative score ) was found to be associated with the domain - specific com - ponent of mathematical creativity under the explicit “be creative” instruction condition . These results affirm the domain - generality of creativity and challenge researchers to identify correlates of domain - specific components of creativity . The debate on the domain - generality vs . domain - specificity of creativity has intensified over the past two decades and is reaching a new height with the publication of a volume mainly devoted to this issue ( Sternberg , Grigorenko , & Singer , 2004 ) . Both sides of the debate have accumulated theoretical and empirical evidence to support their arguments . Domain - generality of creativity has been supported by evidence such as the power of tests of creative thinking ( e . g . , Torrance Tests Volume 40 Number 3 Third Quarter 2006 180 Domain Generality of Creativity of Creative Thinking [ TTCT ] ) to predict subsequent creative achievement ( Plucker , 1999a ; Sternberg , 1989 ) and the reli - ability and validity of self and others’ ( e . g . , teachers’ ) ratings of an individual’s general creativity ( e . g . , Creative Personality Scale ) ( e . g . , Plucker , 1999b ) . The key evidence for domain - specificity derives from the low correlations among ratings of creative performance in dif - ferent domains ( e . g . , poetry , mathematics , and drawings ) ( Baer , 1991 , 1994a ; Conti , Coon , & Amabile , 1996 ; Kaufman & Baer , 2004 ; Han , 2003 ; Han & Marvin , 2002 ; Runco , 1989 ; Ruscio , Whitney , & Amabile , 1998 ) or even within the domain of verbal creativity ( e . g . , poetry vs . story , Baer , 1994a ; paint - ing vs . drawing , Conti et al . , 1996 ) ; low correlations between creativity in specific domains and creativity assessed with measures such as TTCT ( Diakidoy & Spanoudis , 2002 ) and Wallace - Kogan Creative Thinking Test ( Han , 2003 ; Han & Marvin , 2002 ) ; a lack of transfer of learning of creativity skills across domains ( Baer , 1994b , 1996 ) ; and the small number of geniuses who excel in multiple domains ( Baer , 2004 ; Sternberg & Lubart , 1995 ) . The evidence for both sides of the debate , however , has serious weaknesses . For example , when arguing against the domain - generality of creativity , Baer ( 1998 ) questioned the rel - evance and significance of self - report indices of creativity . He believed that response - bias in self - reports may have resulted in the appearance of domain - generality . The explanatory power of TTCT and other divergent thinking tests has also been challenged ( Amabile , 1983 ; Diakidoy & Spanoudis , 2002 ; Han , 2003 ; Han & Marvin , 2002 ; Hocevar & Bachelor , 1989 ) . Research is needed to explore new correlates that may better account for the domain - general components of creativity . One such set of variables involves the trait forms of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation . Research has shown that creative per - formance in various domains is promoted by state intrinsic motivation ( Amabile , 1996 ) although the effects of state extrinsic motivation are less well understood ( Eisenberger & Shanock , 2003 ) . Additionally , in several different domains cre - ative behavior has been associated with stable individual dif - ferences in intrinsic and extrinsic motivational orientations in schoolwork and employment ( Amabile , Hill , Hennessey , & Tighe , 1994 ; Kaufman , 2002 ) and with need for cognition , which Cacioppo and Petty ( 1982 ) define as trait intrinsic moti - vation to engage in effortful cognitive processing ( Dollinger , 2003 ; Tierney , Farmer , & Graen , 1999 ) . In the present study , Journal of Creative Behavior 181 we measured these types of trait motivational orientation . Cre - ative performance in different domains has also been associ - ated with the Creative Personality Scale ( e . g . , Gough , 1979 ; Kaduson & Schaefer , 1991 ; Koestner , Walker , & Fichman , 1999 ) and with measures of originality in word associations ( e . g . , Gough , 1976 ; MacKinnon , 1962 ; Upmanyu , Bhardwaj , & Singh , 1996 ) . Hence , we also included measures of these individual differences . Finally , because creativity , intellectual ability , and academic performance are closely related ( Kuncel , Hezlett , & Ones , 2004 ) , we included students’ SAT scores as potential correlates . The arguments for domain - specificity also have weaknesses . The most fundamental weakness is that they rely almost exclusively on the absence of good evidence in favor of domain - generality , rather than on direct evidence either for domain - specificity or against domain - generality . Reliance on the absence of good evidence for domain - generality is prob - lematic because such an absence may be due to reasons other than domain - specificity . One alternative reason is that evidence from previous research had methodological problems , thus failing to gener - ate good evidence for domain - generality . For example , the low correlations among creativity scores from different domains can be explained by the poor psychometric properties of exist - ing creativity tests , most of which consist of a single item ( i . e . , single task ) . According to measurement theories ( Nunnally , 1978 ) , when a construct is difficult to measure without error , it is recommended that measures include as many alternative indicators as possible in order to increase internal consistency . It would be informative to ask what would the results have been if creativity tests had included more items . Based on existing data summarized by Baer ( 1998 ) , inter - domain correlations ( based on one item in each domain ) were typically around . 20 ( e . g . , r = . 18 in Runco , 1989 ; r = . 23 in Baer , 1991 ; r = . 19 in Baer , 1994a ; r = . 37 in Sternberg & Lubart , 1995 ; also see Conti et al . , 1996 , and Ruscio et al . , 1998 , for modest inter - domain correlations ) . Baer interpreted this mod - est magnitude of correlation as evidence for a lack of domain - generality and hence as evidence for domain - specificity . But if those studies had included more items , say , 10 items , an aver - age inter - item correlation of . 20 would have generated a Cronbach alpha of . 70 ( assuming that the actual association between items were similar to that of the studies summarized by Baer ) . If the number of items was 16 and the inter - item 182 Domain Generality of Creativity correlations were averaged at . 20 , Cronbach alpha would have reached . 80 . Such a level of internal consistency would likely have been interpreted as evidence for domain - generality . It is instructive to consider that most achievement tests have 40 - 50 items . The above discussion suggests that a lack of strong evidence for domain - generality may be due mainly to a lack of multiple - item tests , an issue that was explored in the current study . It should also be pointed out that creativity researchers typically report data from every single item of a creativity test . Although such a practice is understandable given the frequently labor - intensive nature of data collection , one should keep in mind that most other areas of research endorse a process of sys - tematic elimination of items that are not correlated with the total test score . A rigorous examination of the domain - generality of creativ - ity requires as many valid and reliable test items as practically possible . In the present study , we used eight tests — most of which had multiple items — to examine creativity in three domains ( artistic , verbal , and mathematical ) . After establish - ing the factor structure of creativity , structural equation mod - els were used to test whether the correlates were associated with the domain - general vs . domain - specific components of creativity . Finally , test instruction may influence the way domain - general and domain - specific components of creativity are revealed . In some creativity studies , research participants were explicitly asked to “be creative , ” whereas in other studies they were only told to complete a task and might not even be aware that creativity was being measured . Previous research ( e . g . , Chen et al . , 2005 ; Harrington , 1975 ) has found that the explicit “be creative” instruction ( EI ) greatly increased creative performance . More relevant to the present study , there is some evidence that , as compared to the standard condition ( SI ) , the EI condition results in creativity scores that are more closely associated with other measures of creativity . Harrington ( 1975 ) and Katz and Poag ( 1979 ) found that test scores obtained under the EI condition were more closely associated with the scores on the creative personality and ability scales than they were under the SI condition . Similarly , Chand and Runco ( 1993 ) reported that divergent thinking test scores obtained under the EI condition , but not those under the SI condition , were related to self - reports of creative activities and accomplishment . These Journal of Creative Behavior 183 results suggest that domain - generality may be better revealed under the EI condition than under the SI condition . This is perhaps due to the fact that the explicit “be creative” instruc - tion helps to direct research participants’ attention to the cre - ativity dimension of the criteria that will be used in performance evaluation . Participants were 158 ( 72 % females ) undergraduate students enrolled in a large public university in Southern California . This was a subsample of a larger study ( Chen et al . , 2005 ) . This subsample was given a complete battery of eight creativity tests and asked to complete a questionnaire that included measures of motivation and personality traits ( to be described below ) . The mean age of the sample was 21 . 66 yrs . ( s . d . = 3 . 79 yrs . ) . The sample was ethnically diverse : 30 % European Americans , 40 % Asian Americans / Pacific Islanders , and 30 % other ethnic background ( including Mexican Americans , African Ameri - cans , bi - ethnic or multi - ethnic students ) . More than half of the participants’ fathers ( 59 % ) and 46 % of their mothers had a four - year college education or post - graduate degrees . After obtaining informed consent , all students completed a questionnaire that included demographic information , their SAT scores , a creative personality scale , a word association test , and two measures of motivation orientation . Participants were then randomly assigned to either the explicit “be creative” instruction ( EI ) condition or the standard instruction ( SI ) con - dition to complete the creativity tasks . Under the EI condition , participants were explicitly asked to be creative and imagina - tive ( but still appropriate ) in their responses . For example , the specific instruction for the EI condition for drawing was titled “Drawing Creatively” and included the instruction : “This task involves drawing creatively . We want you to create drawings that are highly creative , imaginative . That is , please create drawings that are both original ( novel , uncommon ) and also appropriate ( artistically effective ) . . . And remember : Be as creative and imaginative as you can be ! ” For verbal tasks , students were asked to write a creative story and poems with assigned titles and to write creative titles for photographs . For example , poetry instruction included : “We want you to be as creative as you can possibly be in writing a poem . That is , we want you to write a poem that is both highly original ( unusual , uncommon , non - ordinary ) and highly appropriate ( sensible , poetically effective , beautifully written ) . ” For the chair design and mathematical creativity tasks , the METHOD Participants Procedures 184 Domain Generality of Creativity following sentence was used ( in upper case ) “Try to be as creative ( original ) as you can in solving the problem . ” Under the standard condition , all references to the word “cre - ativity” or related words ( e . g . , original , uncommon , etc . ) were removed . For example , “Drawing Creatively” was replaced with “Visual Imagery” and “Writing Creative Poetry” with “The Poetry of Your Mind . ” Students completed these tasks in their classrooms for extra course credits . Participants created original products in the verbal , artistic , and mathematical domains , and these products were subse - quently assessed for level of creativity . Verbal creativity . Each participant was asked to create two poems , one story , and two titles . The poetry task was adapted from that introduced by Amabile and used extensively in pre - vious creativity studies ( e . g . , Amabile , 1996 ) . Participants were asked to write poems in which line 1 consisted of one noun , line 2 consisted of two adjectives that modified the noun , line 3 consisted of three verbs that were related to the noun , lines 4 and 5 could have any number of words of any grammatical type as long as they were related to the noun , and line 6 repeated the noun in line 1 . As in previous research by other investigators , participants were given the first lines of each poem . Within each instructional condition , participants were randomly assigned either two commonplace titles ( “Hope” and “Sunshine” ) or two unusual titles ( “Ear” and “Window” ) . These title words were selected from a list of 100 words that are deemed to have universal meanings ( Osgood , May , & Miron , 1975 , p . 72 ) . Participants were allowed 6 minutes to write each poem . For the story task , participants were given 15 minutes to write a story with the title “Beyond the Edge” ( from Sternberg & Lubart , 1992 ) . Story writing tasks have been used in many previous creativity studies ( e . g . , Amabile , Hennessey , & Grossman , 1986 ; Koestner , Walker , & Fichman , 1999 ; Moneta & Siu , 2002 ; Sternberg & Lubart , 1995 ) . For the final verbal creativity task , participants were asked to create titles for art photographs . Although title - writing tasks have been employed in a few previous creativity studies ( e . g . , Eisenberger & Rhoades , 2001 ) , the use of photographs as stimuli for such tasks is original to our study . Two photographs featured commonplace photographic subject matter ( Ansel Adams’s realistic landscapes of a dead tree on a hilly pasture , “Tree , Sierra Foothills , CA , 1938 , ” and of a stream running through a field of tall grass , “Bear Track Cove , Alaska , 1948 , ” Measures of Creativity Journal of Creative Behavior 185 in De Cook , 1972 , pp . 43 and 48 , respectively ) , and two photo - graphs featured unusual imagery ( photomontages of a hang - ing door suspended within a boulder and a human face superimposed upon a large rock ; Uelsmann , 1992 , pp . 65 and 111 ) . Participants who were assigned commonplace titles for the poetry tasks were asked to create titles for the two photo - graphs that featured commonplace images , whereas the par - ticipants who had received unusual poetry titles were asked to create titles for the two photographs of unusual imagery . Pho - tographs were presented in counterbalanced order . Participants had 3 minutes to title each photograph . Artistic creativity . To measure artistic creativity , two types of tasks were used which required only minimal technical skill . The drawing task was adapted from tasks used in many previ - ous creativity studies ( e . g . , Chen et al . , 2002 ; Getzels & Cskszentmihalyi , 1976 ; Sobel & Rothenberg , 1980 ; Sternberg & Lubart , 1995 ) . Participants were given 10 minutes to create eight small drawings with the following titles ( four geometric shapes and four non - geometric titles ) : circle , rectangle , triangle , oval , contrast , person , motion , and dream . For the design task , participants were given 8 minutes to design a chair by using two triangles , two ovals , two rectangles , and three lines ( par - ticipants were allowed to use just eight of the nine components if they so desired ) of any size or length . This task was designed for the present study . Mathematical creativity . To measure creativity in math - ematics , two tasks were adapted from Haylock’s ( 1987 ) mea - sures of the originality and flexibility in solutions to ambiguous mathematical problems . On each type of task , participants were given guidelines that defined appropriateness and , within these parameters , were asked to generate multiple responses , which varied greatly in originality . For the “Cutting Rectangles Task , ” participants were asked to partition rectangles by draw - ing straight lines . Participants had 6 minutes to work on four rectangles , of which two were to be segmented into four com - ponent rectangles and two were to be segmented into nine com - ponent rectangles . On the “Nine - Dot Areas Task , ” participants were given a 2 " by 2 " space ( demarcated by nine dots ) and asked to partition the space into segments of 2 square inches by drawing straight lines and connecting the dots . Participants had 6 minutes to work on three “Nine - Dot Areas Tasks . ” We used three methods to assess the creativity of different types of original products . Before presenting products for assessment , we removed each product from its original test Procedures for Creativity Judgment and Coding 186 Domain Generality of Creativity packet , typed each poem , story , and title , and grouped prod - ucts together with other participants’ products of the same type . Judges and coders were trained undergraduate research as - sistants , both for reasons of economy and because previous research has found that judgments made by undergraduates were reliable and valid ( e . g . , highly correlated with judgments made by experts ; Amabile , 1996 , pp . 72 - 73 ; also see Sternberg & Lubart , 1995 ) . Different sets of judges were used for tests in the different domains or sub - domains ( i . e . , geometric draw - ings , nongeometric drawings , chair design , story writing , poem and title writing , and mathematical creativity ) . Consensual assessment technique . Poems , drawings , and stories were judged following Amabile’s ( 1982 ) consensual assessment technique . Although we gathered ratings on mul - tiple dimensions ( e . g . , creativity , liking , technical quality ) , the present study focuses only on the creativity dimension . Judges were instructed to employ their own subjective understanding of creativity , rate each product relative to the others , and use the entire 5 - point rating scale , which ranged from 1 ( not at all creative ) to 5 ( highly creative ) . For each task , products were arranged into a different random order before they were rated by judges . The number of judges ranged from 6 to 8 per task . Inter - rater reliability ( Cronbach alpha ) ranged from . 72 to . 97 and averaged . 89 . Sorting method . For the title writing and chair design tasks , we developed a sorting method to measure creativity . For each task , after the products were randomly shuffled , judges were first asked to sort the products into three approximately equal piles that represented low , medium , and high creativity , and then were asked to further divide the low creativity and the high creativity piles each into two smaller piles , such that prod - ucts were eventually sorted into five levels that approximated a normal distribution . Several previous studies have employed similar methods of pre - normalizing judges’ assessments of creativity ( e . g . , Getzels & Csikszentmihalyi , 1976 ) . Inter - rater reliability ( Cronbach alpha ) ranged from . 75 to . 88 , with a mean of . 82 . Coding method . To measure mathematical creativity , we developed simple objective coding schemes based on Haylock ( 1987 ) . Undergraduate research assistants were trained to use these schemes in coding products . On the Cutting Rectangles Task , products that featured only vertical lines or only hori - zontal lines were coded as low creativity , products that featured vertical and horizontal lines of different lengths ( resulting in Journal of Creative Behavior 187 rectangles of varying size ) were coded as medium creativity , and products that featured more complex configurations ( e . g . , three - dimensional or imbedded rectangles ) were coded as high creativity . For the Nine - Dot Areas Task , we coded creativity according to how small of a unit participants used to generate the 2 - square - inch segments , assigning higher creativity to prod - ucts that featured smaller units . For example , products that featured large segments ( e . g . , a segment half the size of the 4 - square - inch space ) were coded as low in creativity , whereas products that featured the smallest possible unit ( a unit of one - sixteenth of the larger space created by drawing straight lines across all nine dots ) were coded as most highly creative . All products were coded independently by two coders , yielding an initial agreement rate of > 85 % ; inter - coder disagreements were examined and resolved during meetings with the authors . The validity of these coding schemes is supported by Chen et al . ’s ( 2005 ) finding that explicit instruction to be creative significantly increased mathematical creativity , as measured by these coding schemes . Motivational orientation . Two scales were used to assess motivational orientation : the Work Preference Inventory ( Amabile et al . , 1994 ) and the Need for Cognition scale ( Cacioppo , Petty , & Kao , 1984 ) . From the Work Preference Inventory , separate scores were calculated for intrinsic and extrinsic orientations . The intrinsic motivation scale had 15 items . A sample item is “Curiosity is the driving force behind much of what I do . ” The extrinsic motivation scale also had 15 items . A sample item is “I am strongly motivated by the grades I can earn . ” Participants responded to a 6 - point Likert scale , ranging from – 3 ( strongly disagree ) to + 3 ( strongly agree ) . The Cronbach α was . 70 for the intrinsic motivation scale and . 77 for the extrinsic motivation scale . The 18 - item Need for Cog - nition scale ( Cacioppo , Petty , & Kao , 1984 ) was used to mea - sure the intrinsic motivation to engage in effortful cognitive processing . Sample items include “I really enjoy a task that involves coming up with new solutions to problems . ” Partici - pants responded to a 6 - point Likert scale , ranging from – 3 ( strongly disagree ) to + 3 ( strongly agree ) . Cronbach α for this scale was . 88 . Creative Personality Scale . The Creative Personality Scale of the Adjective Checklist ( Gough , 1979 ) included 30 adjectives , 18 of which are considered to be positively indica - tive of creativity ( e . g . , inventive , original , unconventional ) and 12 of which are coded negatively ( e . g . , conservative , cautious , Measures of MotivationalOrientation , Creative Personality , and Word Associations 188 Domain Generality of Creativity interests narrow ) . This scale has been linked to creative performance ( Gough , 1979 ; Kaduson & Schaefer , 1991 ; Koestner , Walker , & Fichman , 1999 ) . Cronbach α of the scale was . 66 . Word Association Test . We used 41 stimulus words ( e . g . , Anger , Chair , Egg , Food , House , Life , Moon , Woman ) . These words often appear in daily language , and most of them are included in the list of 100 words that have similar semantic differential meanings world - wide ( Osgood , May , & Miron , 1975 ) . An originality score was created in the following way . We first assigned a number to each word - association based on how many participants in the study gave the same response to the same stimulus word . The frequency number or score was then standardized within each stimulus word across all subjects . The standardized score was then reversed to reflect original - ity : That is , a response used by few subjects got a high origi - nality score . Finally , the originality scores were averaged across all stimulus words to create a total score . Cronbach α of this scale was . 76 . The scores from the eight tests of creativity were submitted to a principal component analysis ( see Table 1 for the means and standard deviations and other descriptive statistics of these and other key variables used in the present study ) . Three fac - tors were extracted for both the standard instruction ( SI ) con - dition and the explicit “be creative” instruction ( EI ) condition . For the SI condition , the first factor accounted for 25 % of the variance , the second , 18 % , and the third , 14 % , yielding a total of 57 % of the variance . The corresponding numbers for the EI condition were 31 % , 16 % , and 13 % , yielding a total of 59 % explained variance . After varimax rotations , the loadings of the tests on the factors generally corresponded to the three domains of artistic , verbal , and mathematical creativity ( see Table 2 ) . Given this evidence , summary scores were created for the three domains of creativity . The three summary scores were again submitted to a factor analysis to see whether they loaded on a single second - order factor of overall creativity . For both conditions , only one fac - tor was extracted . It accounted for 45 % of the variance for the SI condition and 52 % of the variance for the EI condition . The loadings of artistic , verbal , and mathematical creativity on this one factor were respectively . 74 , . 79 , and . 41 for the SI condi - tion and . 81 , . 70 , and . 65 for the EI condition .

The absolute possible range for the raw scores ranged from – 6478 ( when every of 158 subjects picked the same word for each of the 41 target word ) to 41 ( when no one but the individual subject picked the same word for each of the 41 target words ) . Another way of examining the domain - generality of creativ - ity is to conduct reliability analyses at the item level . As dis - cussed in the introduction , we anticipated that , with a moderate number of items , there might be a satisfactory level of internal consistency among creativity test items . Using all 21 items ( four geometric drawings , four non - geometric drawings , one chair design , one story writing , two poems , two titles of photographs , 190 Domain Generality of Creativity four rectangles for the cutting task , and three nine - dot area tasks ) , Cronbach a was . 83 for the whole sample ( . 73 for the SI condition and . 82 for the EI condition ) . These results provide clear evidence for a domain - general component of creativity . Given that about half of the variance of the three summary scores was shared ( i . e . , domain - general ) and the other half contributed by a combination of domain - specific components and measurement errors ( see second - order factor analysis above ) , we proceeded to examine the associations between motivation and personality factors and the domain - specific vs . domain - general components of creativity . Structural equation models are ideal for these analyses because they simulta - neously evaluate the covariance structure among the three domains of creativity ( with a latent construct of domain - gen - eral creativity ) and their associations with a potential correlate ( see Figure 1 ) . The model depicted in Figure 1 was used to test all seven correlates ( intrinsic motivation , extrinsic motiva - tion , need for cognition , creativity personality scale , original - ity in word association , SAT - verbal score , and SAT - quantitative score ) . The null hypothesis for this model is that each corre - late was associated only with the domain - general component of creativity ( i . e . , the latent construct of creativity ) .

Factor loadings greater than . 40 are in bold . Journal of Creative Behavior 191 terms ( e ) for each domain of creativity include both measure - ment errors and domain - specific aspects of creativity . In the null hypothesis , the covariance between the correlate and the domain - specific aspects of creativity was set to zero ( i . e . , no association between the correlate and domain - specific aspects of creativity in this model that simultaneously takes into ac - count the association between the correlate and the domain - general component of creativity ) . When the model does not fit the data , the null hypothesis should be rejected . In that case , one should examine the residuals to find out whether there is a potential covariance between the correlate and a particular domain of creativity . The model should be re - tested after the addition of a covari - ance between the correlate and the error term ( which , as indi - cated earlier , includes the domain - specific component of creativity as well as measurement error ) . Before we show the results from the structural equation models , it is helpful to show the bivariate correlations between the correlates and creativity ( see Table 3 ) . Clearly , all correla - tions were in the expected directions , although not all reached the conventional significance level . Most importantly , 11 out of the 14 correlations for the total creativity score were sig - nificant and 1 was marginally significant . That number of sig - nificant correlations was greater than that for each of the domains ( four for artistic creativity , seven for verbal creativity , and five for mathematical creativity ) . These results appear to indicate that the total score ( a proxy of the domain - general component of creativity ) had a more consistent association with the correlates than did the domain - specific scores . It is not clear , however , whether there were correlates that were associated with domain - specific components after the domain - FIGURE 1 . Structural Equation Models Used to Assess Correlates of Do - main - General and Domain - Specific Components of Creativity . 192 Domain Generality of Creativity general components are taken into consideration ( or partialed out in traditional correlational analyses ) . Structural equation models tested this in a systematic manner . Tables 4 and 5 present the results of the structural equation models . As shown in Table 4 , six of the seven models for the SI condition fit the data very well ( non - significant chi - square , fit indices about . 90 or higher ) . All standardized residuals were small . Only one model ( the one involving extrinsic motivation ) had less than adequate fit according to some of the indices ( e . g . , NNFI ) but not others ( e . g . , chi - square ) . However , a close examination of the standardized residuals did not show any evidence that extrinsic motivation was a domain - specific cor - relate . In sum , all seven correlates were correlated ( at least marginally ) with the domain - general component of creativity , and none of them was correlated with any domain - specific component of creativity . Similar results were found with the EI condition , but with one important exception . As shown in Table 5 , six of the seven initial models fit the data very well and each correlate was sig - nificantly or marginally associated with the domain - general component of creativity .

For the SAT - quantitative score , how - ever , the model did not fit ( i . e . , a significant chi - square and poor fit indices ) . An examination of the residuals showed that the SAT - quantitative score had a unique association with math - ematical creativity with a standardized residual of . 32 . A modi - fied model ( with the addition of a covariance term between SAT - quantitative score and the error term of mathematical creativity ) was re - run and the results showed a very good fit between the model and the data . Whether creativity is domain - general or domain - specific has been debated for some time . Few prior studies have found strong evidence for domain generality . The “splitters” ( borrow - ing the terminology from a parallel debate about the domain - specificity of intelligence ) have interpreted a lack of evidence for domain - generality as proof of domain specificity . However , a lack of evidence for domain - generality could have been due to measurement problems and poor choices of correlates for domain - general components of creativity . With improved mea - surement of creativity in multiple domains and the inclusion of variables that have been found to be consistently related to creativity in various domains , the present study found clear evidence of domain - generality and little evidence of domain - specificity . This is the first study to our knowledge that pro - vides reasonable psychometric evidence ( Plucker , 2004 ) for domain - generality of creativity . We hasten to point out that there is still much room for im - provement in the measurement of creativity . More and better items are needed for each domain . A much - improved battery of creativity tests might better distinguish the domain - general and domain - specific components of creativity and better iden - tify the correlates for each . Future research should include new domains and new potential correlates of domain - specific com - ponents of creativity . A better measure of creativity may also improve the factor structure . Although our results generally agreed with existing conceptions of the three domains , we had two tests whose load - ings can be improved . For example , chair design loaded at a modest level of between . 40 and . 50 across two factors , one of which differed across the two conditions . Title writing also failed to have adequate loading on verbal creativity under the stan - dard condition . Future researchers need to improve on these tests and perhaps include new domains of creativity ( e . g . , sci - entific creativity , musical creativity ) . A more comprehensive DISCUSSION 196 Domain Generality of Creativity test of creativity would likely involve a multi - level ( items , subdomains , domains , and domain - general ) factor structure involving first - , second - , and even third - order factors of creativ - ity . A large sample will also be needed to test such a model directly with confirmatory factor analysis . It is clear from this study , however , that when the number of test items is adequate ( half a dozen for each domain ) , a reasonable level of internal consistency of the overall creativity test can be achieved . Finally , instruction condition should also be considered when studying the domain - specificity of creativity . Consistent with our hypothesis , the degree of domain - generality of creativity was affected by the instruction condition . The EI condition re - sulted in 6 - 7 % more shared variance among the various tests ( first principal component , 31 % – 25 % = 6 % ) and among the three domains ( 52 % – 45 % = 7 % ) than the SI condition . These results shed further light on the effects of the explicit “be cre - ative” instruction on the testing of creativity . The explicit “be creative” instruction not only elicits more creative responses ( e . g . , Chen et al . , 2005 ; Harrington , 1975 ) , but also increases the domain - general component of creative performance . Future research should investigate the mechanisms ( e . g . , goal - setting function , Locke & Latham , 1990 ) involved in the instruc - tion effects . AMABILE , T . M . ( 1982 ) .
