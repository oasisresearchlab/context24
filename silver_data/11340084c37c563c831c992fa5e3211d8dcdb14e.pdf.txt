Jaffe 4 The emergence of HIV - 1 group M subtype B in North American men who have sex with men was a key turning point in the HIV / AIDS pandemic . Phylogenetic studies have suggested cryptic subtype B circulation in the United States ( US ) throughout the 1970s 1 , 2 and an even older presence in the Caribbean 2 . However , these temporal and geographical inferences , based upon partial HIV - 1 genomes that postdate the recognition of AIDS in 1981 , remain contentious 3 , 4 and the earliest movements of the virus within the US are unknown . We serologically screened > 2 , 000 1970s serum samples and developed a highly sensitive approach for recovering viral RNA from degraded archival samples . Here , we report eight coding - complete genomes from US serum samples from 1978 – 1979—eight of the nine oldest HIV - 1 group M genomes to date . This early , full - genome ‘snapshot’ reveals that the US HIV - 1 epidemic exhibited extensive genetic diversity in the 1970s but also provides strong evidence for its emergence from a pre - existing Caribbean epidemic . Bayesian phylogenetic analyses estimate the jump to the US at around 1970 and place the ancestral US virus in New York City with 0 . 99 posterior probability support , strongly suggesting this was the crucial hub of early US HIV / AIDS diversification . Logistic growth coalescent models reveal epidemic doubling times of 0 . 86 and 1 . 12 years for the US and Caribbean , respectively , suggesting rapid early expansion in each location 3 . Comparisons with more recent data reveal many of these insights to be unattainable without archival , full - genome sequences . We also recovered the HIV - 1 genome from the individual known as ‘Patient 0’ ( ref . 5 ) and found neither biological nor historical evidence that he was the primary case in the US or for subtype B as a whole . We discuss the genesis and persistence of this belief in the light of these evolutionary insights . No comprehensive genomic analysis of the emergence and early spread of HIV - 1 in North America—where HIV / AIDS was first recognized—has been possible because the only pre - 1980 HIV - 1 group M genome currently available ( strain Z321B ) was sampled in Africa . To fill this gap , we performed serological screening and viral genome sequencing of archived serum samples dating back to 1978 – 1979 , originally collected from men who have sex with men ( MSM ) cohort patients in New York City ( NYC ) and San Francisco ( SF ) . NYC samples were from volun - teers in a prospective study of AIDS established in 1984 ( ref . 6 ) , 378 of whom had been part of an earlier cohort of 8 , 906 men involved in hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) studies beginning in 1978 ( ref . 7 ) , and for which stored sera from 1978 and / or 1979 were available 8 . Previous work showed that 6 . 6 % of these sera from NYC in 1978 – 1979 were HIV - 1 seropositive 6 ; 33 of these positive samples were chosen for attempted HIV - 1 sequencing . The sera from SF originated from a study of approximately 6 , 875 patients enrolled in the late 1970s in HBV studies at the San Francisco City Clinic 9 . We tested 2 , 231 of these samples from 1978 and found , by western blot , that 83 ( 3 . 7 % ) were positive for HIV - 1 antibodies ; of these , 20 were randomly chosen for attempted HIV - 1 sequencing . Low template number and degradation arising from long - term stor - age were major challenges for genomic analysis , as encountered previ - ously with similar samples 10 : recovered RNA was generally below the limits of quantification and initial attempts at amplification of reverse - transcribed viral RNA failed consistently and indicated that viral RNA survived in the 1970s samples only in short fragments . This led us to design an RNA ‘jackhammering’ approach to greatly increase both the ability to detect viral RNA - positive samples and to recover complete genomic HIV - 1 sequences from them . Briefly , we used large panels of primers to amplify many short fragments in separate pools , such that amplicons overlapped between but not within each pool ( Extended Data Fig . 1 and Supplementary Table 1 ) . Each pool’s amplicon set filled gaps between those of complementary pools , with the entire panel pro - viding complete genomic coverage . Moreover , a preliminary , multiplex amplification step greatly concentrated target RNA before final ampli - fication and sequencing . Three samples from SF and five from NYC provided sufficient data to assemble coding - complete sequences . Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of these HIV - 1 genomes ( Fig . 1 and Extended Data Fig . 2 ) showed that although they were the oldest sampled outside Africa , they do not fall on the deepest branches even within subtype B . Instead , the 1970s genomes and the US epidemic as a whole were phylogenetically nested within the more genetically diverse , older subtype B epidemic in Caribbean countries . Separate analyses of gag , pol and env sequences also placed the US sequences in a strongly supported monophyletic clade nested within the paraphyletic Caribbean subtype B sequences from Haiti , Dominican Republic , Jamaica , Trinidad and Tobago and Haitian immigrants in the US ( Extended Data Figs 3 , 4 ) . Molecular clock phylogeographic analysis of the complete genome data sup - ported a subtype B ancestor in the Caribbean ( posterior probability > 0 . 99 ) dating to 1967 ( 95 % credibility interval 1963 – 1970 ) ( Extended Data Table 1 ) . This provided genome - wide evidence that the epidemic moved from the Caribbean to the US rather than from the US to the Caribbean 2 . Location transition estimates recovered a relatively precise date ( 1971 ( 1969 – 1973 ) , Extended Data Table 1 ) for the HIV - 1 jump from the Caribbean , very shortly before the US most recent common ancestor ( MRCA ) . This narrow timing is aided by the basal relationship of a very close relative from the Caribbean ( sequence ‘H6’ from an individ - ual who entered the US from Haiti in 1981 ) 2 ( Extended Data Fig . 2 ) . The probability density of the date of introduction to the US over - laps with the deep branching structure in Caribbean diversity ( Fig . 1 and Extended Data Fig . 3 ) , indicating that the US clade emerged from the Caribbean epidemic during its early growth phase . We estimated a relatively fast logistic growth rate of 0 . 62 ( 0 . 26 – 0 . 99 ) yr − 1 within the Caribbean population ( Fig . 2 ) . That of the US population was even 1 Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology , University of Arizona , Tucson , Arizona 85721 , USA . 2 Department of History and Philosophy of Science , University of Cambridge , Cambridge CB2 3RH , UK . 3 Departments of Biomathematics , Biostatistics and Human Genetics , David Geffen School of Medicine , University of California Los Angeles , Los Angeles , California 90095 , USA . 4 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Atlanta , Georgia 30333 , USA . 5 UCB , Brussels BE - 1070 , Belgium . 6 Laboratory of Infectious Disease Prevention , The New York Blood Center , New York , New York 10065 , USA . 7 Department of Microbiology and Immunology , Rega Institute , KU Leuven—University of Leuven , Minderbroedersstaat 10 , 3000 Leuven , Belgium . © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited , part of Springer Nature .

These mean growth rate estimates corresponded to doubling times of 1 . 12 years and 0 . 86 years for the Caribbean and the US , respectively ; both the more rapid and longer growth in the US appear to have contributed a higher number of ‘effective infections’ ( Fig . 2 ) , with the US overtaking the Caribbean by around 1977 despite the later HIV - 1 emergence in the US . Molecular clock analyses of larger numbers of env sequences revealed similar time of the most recent common ancestor ( TMRCA ) estimates for the key nodes ( Fig . 3 , Extended Data Table 1 and Extended Data Figs 5 , 6 ) . Interestingly , our modest snapshot of 1970s sequences from NYC and SF ( Fig . 3 , Extended Data Fig . 5b ) encompassed the full diver - sity exhibited by HIV - 1 sequences from later years ( that is , it shares the same MRCA as larger sequence sets sampled in later years ) : all post - 1985 US sequences are nested within the early diversity captured by the lim - ited number of 1970s sequences we recovered ( Extended Data Fig . 6 ) . A phylogeographic reconstruction including only those US sequences sampled from known locations between 1978 – 1984 ( Fig . 1 ) demonstrated that the NYC epidemic was already relatively mature and genetically diverse by 1979 , tracing back to an MRCA estimated at 1972 ( 1970 – 1974 ) and there is strong support for the idea that the US subtype B ancestor circulated in NYC ( posterior probability = 0 . 99 ) . Indeed , the extensive genetic diversity in the US ( and in NYC in particular ) in 1978 – 1979 can be explained only by several years of circulation of the virus before 1978 – 1979 . Using sequences sampled from NYC , North Carolina and California relatively late in the epidemic ( comparable to the 1978 – 1984 East coast , West coast and Southern sampling ) , we still inferred a US ancestor in NYC , but with only modest support that prevents us from drawing firm conclusions ( pp = 0 . 67 , Extended Data Figure 6b and Extended Data Table 1 ) . As a generality , early samples close to the deep branching structure are essential to confidently reconstruct the initial spatio - temporal expansion dynamics in exponentially growing populations . Compared to NYC , the SF epidemic in 1978 appeared to have been established more recently ( Figs 1 , 3 , and Extended Data Figs 2b , 5b ) . It is striking that all three independently detected complete HIV - 1 genomes we found are so closely related ; moreover , they form a cluster with three partial env sequences sampled in SF during the same period 10 ( Extended Data Fig . 5b ) . This suggests that the bulk of the HIV - 1 infections in SF in 1978 traced back to a single introduction from NYC in around 1976 ( consistent with the lower HIV - 1 seroprev - alence in the SF cohort ) . The sampled sequences thus reveal a series of key founder events in the genesis of subtype B ( for example , Fig . 3 and Extended Data Table 1 ) , with the epidemic spreading from the African HIV - 1 group M epicentre to the Caribbean by about 1967 , from the Caribbean to NYC by about 1971 and from NYC to SF by about 1976 , quickly followed by extensive geographical mixing in the US and beyond . Reports of one cluster of homosexual men with AIDS linked through sexual contact were important in suggesting the sex - ual transmission route of an infectious agent before the iden - tification of HIV - 1 ( refs 5 , 11 ) . Beginning in California , CDC investigators eventually connected 40 men in ten American cities to this sexual network . Investigators placed one man with Kaposi’s sarcoma near the centre of a sociogram representing this cluster and identified him as ‘Patient 0’—a ‘non - Californian AIDS patient’ and a possible ‘carrier’ of an infectious agent ( Extended Data Fig . 7 ) . Before publication , Patient ‘O’ was the abbreviation used to indicate that this patient with Kaposi’s sarcoma resided ‘Out ( side ) - of - California . ’ As investigators numbered the cluster cases by date of symptom onset , the letter ‘O’ was misinterpreted as the number ‘0 , ’ and the non - Californian AIDS patient entered the literature with that title 12 . Although the authors of the cluster study repeatedly maintained that Patient 0 was probably not the ‘source’ of AIDS for the cluster or the wider US epidemic , many people have subsequently employed the term ‘patient zero’ to denote an original or primary case , and many still believe the story today 13 . We therefore recovered the complete HIV - 1 genome of Patient 0 and exam - ined it against the backdrop provided by the 1970s sequences . Although labelled as the cluster study’s ‘index patient’ , Patient 0 was neither the first AIDS case to come to CDC researchers’ Africa California Caribbean Georgia New York 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 Patient 0 1979 | B | US | 1979 | 12NY79 1978 | B | US | 1978 | 20SF78 1978 | B | US | 1978 | 3SF78 1979 | B | US | 1979 | 4NY79 1979 | B | US | 1979 | 16NY79 1978 | B | US | 1978 | 4SF78 1979 | B | US | 1979 | 1NY79 1979 | B | US | 1979 | 7NY79 Year Figure 1 | Maximum clade credibility ( MCC ) tree summary of the Bayesian spatio - temporal reconstruction based on complete HIV - 1 genome data .

In general , the CDC numbered cases in the order that the reports reached the agency from different cities and employed the terms ‘cases’ and ‘patients’ interchangeably . Patient 0 , until he was linked to the cluster and took on his new name , was Case ( or Patient ) 057 . The cluster study’s LA 6 was the CDC’s Case 032 , and several cases in the New York section of the cluster 5 ( Extended Data Fig . 7 ) were also reported before Patient 0 ( and thus brought to investigators’ attention first ) : NY 3 was Case 001 , NY 2 was Case 002 , NY 6 was Case 010 and NY 5 was Case 053 ( ref . 14 ) . The information available for CDC investigators to establish symp - tom onset dates was often fragmentary and thus resisted uniform categorization . Sometimes onset was determined on the basis of lym - phadenopathy , other times by the appearance or diagnosis of Kaposi’s sarcoma or Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia . Investigators were unable to link to the cluster several NYC - based cases that had much earlier dates of symptom onset . For example , Case 154 was a middle - aged European man whose reported onset date for Kaposi’s sarcoma was January 1975 ; and Case 153 , when he was diagnosed with Kaposi’s sarcoma in September 1981 , recalled having swollen glands as early as June 1977 ( ref . 15 ) . Yet even within the cluster , Case 057’s symp - toms ( lymphadenopathy in December 1979 and a Kaposi’s sarcoma lesion diagnosed in May 1980 , ref . 5 ) appeared considerably later than those of several other cases . LA 1 ( Case 335 ) developed a lesion in February 1978 ( ref . 16 ) , whereas NY 1 ( Case 152 ) experienced the onset of Kaposi’s sarcoma in December 1978 , NY 2 ( Case 002 ) in May 1979 and NY 3 ( Case 001 ) in August 1979 ( ref . 14 ) . In his book And the Band Played On , Randy Shilts identified ‘Patient Zero’ by name as a highly sexually active French - Canadian flight attendant 17 . Unlike the initial reports of the cluster , media coverage of Shilts’s book strongly insinuated that this individual was the source of the North American epidemic and an exemplar of dangerous disease transmission 18 —ideas which found a global audience ( Supplementary Discussion ) . However , we found that the HIV - 1 genome from this indi - vidual appeared typical of US strains of the time and was not basal to the US diversity , let alone to the deeper Caribbean subtype B diversity , in a manner that might be suggestive of a special role ( Figs 1 , 3 ) . In short , we found no evidence that Patient 0 was the first person infected by this lineage of HIV - 1 . In addition to donating plasma for analysis , Patient 0 provided investigators with the names of nearly 10 % of his sexual partners over several years 5 , while many other cluster patients were una - ble to share more than a handful of names 16 . This strongly sug - gests that ascertainment bias contributed to his central role in the cluster study and its diagrammatic representation . Later research would also call into question the cluster study’s estimated average latency period of 10 . 5 months between sexual contact and symp - tom onset , with a revised average incubation period approaching 10 years for MSM . In retrospect , the study’s sociogram ( Extended Data Fig . 7 ) almost certainly depicted the sexual contacts of these men years after they had contracted HIV - 1 ( ref . 19 ) ( Supplementary Discussion ) . Other East coast HIV - 1 sequences fall much closer to the main early - California clade we identify than does that of Patient 0 ( Fig . 3 ) . Thus , while he did link AIDS cases in New York and Los Angeles through sexual contact , our results refute the widespread mis - interpretation that he also infected them with HIV - 1 . Much like historical reconstructions , phylogenetic inferences are often generated from data collected long after the critical events occurred . Our work highlights the importance of complete viral genomes from early archival specimens , carefully contextualized through historical analysis , without which this detailed picture of these early landmarks in the HIV / AIDS pandemic would not have been possible .

The map inset shows the initial introduction of the subtype B lineage into the Caribbean from Africa . From there , the virus spreads first to NY and subsequently to different locations in the United States . The tree depicts the US clade , plus the most closely related basal Haiti strain , as inferred from the ‘env 74’ analysis ( Extended Data Fig . 5b ) .

HIV - 1 serological screening of serum samples from San Francisco from 1978 . We tested 2 , 231 samples collected from the MSM cohort in San Francisco in 1978 ( ref . 9 ) and detected 83 HIV - 1 - positives by Western Blot ( 3 . 7 % preva - lence ) . Samples were first screened by GS HIV - 1 / HIV - 2 Plus O EIA ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) and reactive samples were further tested by WB Genetic Systems HIV - 1 Western Blot ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) . HIV - 1 nucleic acid amplification . A total of 33 samples of frozen serum from New York City previously identified as positive for antibody to HIV - 1 6 – 8 were assayed ; and a total of 20 frozen serum samples from San Francisco 9 , identified as part of the present study as positive for antibody to HIV - 1 , were assayed . The New York City samples were from 1978 and 1979 though no complete genomic sequences from 1978 were developed . The San Francisco samples were all from 1978 . RNA recovered from samples from both NY and SF was generally undetectable when assaying 5 - μ l aliquots in a Qubit 2 . 0 fluorometer using the Qubit RNA HS reagents ( detection limit , 250 pg μ l − 1 ) . Additionally , a sample of peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) and a sample of serum were both assayed ; these had been collected from a single indi - vidual in 1983 ( Patient 0 ) , and the samples were stored at CDC Atlanta . Other than Patient 0 , now deceased , the data recorded were unlinked to individual identifiers and the work was approved by the Human Subjects Protection Program at the University of Arizona . Four panels of degenerate primers ( Supplementary Table 1 and Extended Data Fig . 1 ) were designed using a suite of North American subtype B sequences . We aimed to design primers able to amplify both conserved regions and predictably variable sites . Primers within each panel were designed to generate sequence from the 5 ′ end of gag to the 3 ′ end of nef and were designed to amplify overlapping frag - ments . Two panels ‘HIVL’ ( n = 25 ) and ‘HIVLb’ ( n = 22 ) were designed to amplify fragments of approximately 500 – 650 bases in length . Two other panels ‘HIVM’ ( n = 50 ) and ‘HIVR’ ( n = 46 ) were designed to amplify fragments of approximately 200 – 320 bases in length . Nucleic acids from 100 - μ l aliquots of serum ( or PBMCs in the case of Patient 0 ) were isolated using the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit ( Qiagen ) with 5 mcg added carrier RNA . Serum samples were then treated with DNase I ( Invitrogen , Life Technologies ) before reverse transcription . PBMC nucleic acids were left untreated . Proviral DNA from Patient 0’s PBMCs was amplified with all four primer panels and from multiple separate isolations . Amplification was achieved using Invitrogen platinum Taq DNA polymerase high fidelity ( Life Technologies ) and run for 55 cycles at an annealing temperature of 52 °C . Additionally , attempts were made to amplify longer fragments using PCR supermix high fidelity ( Life Technologies ) and forward and reverse primers matched from the HIVLb primer panel for long fragment length followed by nesting with primers for slightly shorter fragment length . A single fragment of slightly more than 7 , 000 bases was generated after mul - tiple attempts with multiple primer combinations and cloned using the Invitrogen TOPO XL PCR cloning kit ( Life Technologies ) . Fragments of individual clones were then amplified using HIVLb forward and reverse primers matched to give approximately 1 , 000 - base overlapping fragments and then sequenced . RNA jackhammering . RNA jackhammering of the serum samples proceeded as follows : aliquots of RNA extract were reverse transcribed using the GoScript reverse transcription system ( Promega ) using a program of 4 cycles of 50 °C for 30 min followed by 55 °C for 30 min and a final incubation at 85 °C for 10 min . Primers used were pools of reverse primers from widely spaced amplicons ( Supplementary Table 1 , Extended Data Fig . 1 ) , typically nine or ten primers per pool in a single reaction tube , with the wide spacing abrogating the possibility of incorporation of an internal primer into any given amplicon . Reverse transcription products were then briefly amplified in multiplex reactions in the pool - specific tube ( denaturation for 3 min at 94 °C followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s , 52 °C for 30 s , 68 °C for 30 s , and a final extension of 68 °C for 5 min ) with matching forward primer pools ( a ‘preliminary amplification’ step ) . Sequences were then amplified from individual aliquots taken from the pool - specific tubes , via single primer pairs ( denaturation for 3 min at 94 °C followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s , 52 °C for 30 s , 68 °C for 30 s , and a final extension of 68 °C for 5 min ) . Two separate isolates were amplified from each sample in this manner , with a minimum of one amplification with each primer panel per isolate . Five out of the 33 ( 15 % ) of the NY sera assayed yielded complete HIV - 1 genomic data as did 3 out of the 20 ( 15 % ) SF sera , suggesting that levels of viral RNA preservation were very similar in each collection . In Extended Data Fig . 1 we schematically illustrate the RNA jackhammering approach and its advantages over standard RT – PCR procedures for degraded , low input samples . For a conventional RT – PCR approach with a fairly long amplification product we would perform reverse transcription and obtain one potentially ampli - fiable cDNA product . We would then aliquot ~ 10 % of the reverse transcription product for amplification in a PCR reaction with forward and reverse primers . Even if the single cDNA product made it into the PCR reaction , the desired amplification product would be too long and a PCR amplicon would therefore not be obtained . For RT – PCR with a shorter amplification product , more appropriately sized given the damaged RNA in the sample , there was still a 90 % chance that it would be deemed a negative sample since most aliquots will not contain the rare cDNA product . Using multiple primer sets would increase the chance of a PCR - positive result , but most PCR reactions remained negative because most aliquots lack target cDNA . Even with a 10 primer - pair pool and 10 final PCR reactions , there may be no amplified product . The RNA jackhammering approach targets large panels of appropriately short amplicons , uses discrete pools of non - overlapping primers pairs for reverse transcription , and includes a crucial multiplex pre - amplification step to ensure that each aliquot contained ample template molecules for the final PCR amplification ( a separate reaction for each primer pair in the entire panel ) . Sequencing was performed at the University of Arizona Genetics Core using an ABI 3730XL . The Patient 0 sample contained considerable heterogeneity ( mixed bases ) both in proviral assembly and in viral RNA amplification . Heterogeneity in the NY and SF samples ( all sequences derived from viral RNA ) was low . In all cases consensus sequences were used in the phylogenetic analyses . Primer sequences were computationally removed from all sequence data before assembling genomic consensus sequences , which yielded coding - complete genomic data with exception of a few small gaps and the 3 ′ end of the nef gene ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . Validation of the jackhammering approach . To validate this approach we obtained seed stock samples from the NIH AIDS Reagent program of subtype B viruses from the US ( US657 ) and Haiti ( HT599 ) and applied a jackhammering approach with independent runs of both the HIVM and HIVR primer panels ( Extended Data Fig . 8 ) . For US657 we recovered , in total , from both runs combined , 8 , 194 nt of high quality data . HIVM and HIVR are independent runs with completely different primer sets , yet where the data overlapped , they were > 99 . 9 % similar . Moreover , the few heterogeneities did not line up with heterogeneous primers but fell in regions between primers , demonstrating that differences could not be attributed to the incorporation of primers into the recovered sequences . This was expected both because the wide spacing of amplicons within a single pool of primer pairs pre - vents incorporation of primers within amplified products and because all primer sequences from final amplification products were computationally removed from the sequences before assembly of genomic sequences . There are 3 , 354 bases in the published US657 sequence . Our data covered about 90 % of the 3 , 354 bases of previously published US657 sequence ( GenBank accession number U04908 ) and all of our individual amplicons in the region of overlap had US657 as the highest BLAST hit and were > 99 % similar to the published sequence . For HT599 the HIVM and HIVR primer panels developed 8 , 545 nt of data , 99 . 6 % of the target . The HIVM - derived sequence was > 99 . 9 % similar to the HIVR - derived sequence . We recovered 100 % of the overlap with the previously published HT599 sequence ( 2 , 881 nt , GenBank accession number U08447 ) with 99 . 5 % similarity . To evaluate discrepancies between the jackhammering - recovered sequences and both US657 and HT599 , we compared consensus sequences of combined HIVM and HIVR data with the respective published sequences by adding them to our complete genome alignment and reconstructing a maximum likelihood tree ( Extended Data Fig . 8a ) . As expected , the independently generated sequences from each virus clustered very closely and only had short tips from their common ancestors , resulting from a very small number of substitutions in their overlapping regions . In a root - to - tip analysis ( Extended Data Fig . 8b ) , our sequences ( with a target symbol ) were associated with somewhat smaller residuals than the published sequences ( with a circle ) , indicating that our data are likely to be more accurate and , importantly , cannot contain primer remnants as this would result in much larger residuals . Sequence data . To construct the data sets for the analyses shown in Fig . 1 and Extended Data Figs 2 – 4 we searched the Los Alamos National Laboratories ( LANL ) HIV database ( http : / / hiv . lanl . gov / ) for all available genome - length HIV - 1 sequences from Caribbean countries , which had previously been shown to exhibit diverse subtype B lineages that fall basal to a monophyletic ‘pandemic’ clade of subtype B that accounts for most US and other non - Caribbean subtype infections 2 . These included sequences sampled in Haiti , Dominican Republic , Jamaica and from Haitians who had recently immigrated to the US from Haiti ( ‘H3’ and ‘H5’ from 1982 , ‘H6’ and ‘H7’ from 1983 , ‘RF _ HAT’ from 1983 ) 2 . For sequences H3 , H5 , H6 and H7 pol sequences were not available , but partial gag and full - length env sequences were available . For the full - genome analyses the pol gene was treated as missing data . We then added a similar number of genomes from the US from © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited , part of Springer Nature . All rights reserved . Letter reSeArCH a similar time period ( 1982 – 2005 ) , plus one each from France and the UK , as well as outgroup sequences of subtype D from the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( D . R . C . ) . We called this the ‘full genome 46’ data set because it contained 46 genomes . The gag , pol and env data sets depicted in Extended Data Fig . 3 were each derived from the respective sub - genomic region of this same set of taxa . The subset of ‘full genome 46’ that contained only those US sequences sampled from 1978 – 1984 we called ‘full genome 38’ . For the env analyses in Fig . 3 and Extended Data Fig . 5 the alignment from ref . 2 was used , with the addition of the sequences generated for the present study , additional Caribbean subtype B sequences from 2000 to 2005 , and four early sub - type B partial env sequences from San Francisco 10 . This alignment we called ‘ env 105’ . The subset that contained only those US sequences sampled from 1978 – 1984 we called ‘ env 74’ . For Extended Data Fig . 6 we added to ‘ env 105’ a comparable number—relative to those sampled from 1978 – 1984 from known locations ( New York , California , Georgia , Pennsylvania , New Jersey ) ( Extended Data Fig . 4b ) – of randomly sampled sequences from 1997 – 2007 from NY , SF , and North Carolina ( the closest available site with sufficient numbers to stand in for the Georgia ones from the 1978 – 1984 sample ) . We called this alignment ‘ env 133’ . In all cases sequences were manually aligned using Se - Al ( http : / / tree . bio . ed . ac . uk / software / seal / ) . All sequence alignments , input files , tree files and primer sequences are available at the Dryad Digital Repository ( doi : 10 . 5061 / dryad . 7mv7v ) . Recombination analysis and maximum likelihood tree reconstruction . Maximum likelihood phylogenies were reconstructed using RAxML under on a general time - reversible model of substitution with gamma distributed rate varia - tion among sites 20 . Bootstrap support values were calculated using 1 , 000 pseudo - replicates . To detect the presence of recombination , we first performed the Phi test 21 on every data set ( Extended Data Table 1 ) . When the null hypothesis of absence of recombination was rejected ( P < 0 . 05 ) , we subsequently analysed the data set using RDP4 ( ref . 22 ) and produced new alignments in which the minor recombinant regions were deleted from putative recombinants . Re - analyses of these ‘recombination - free’ data sets using the Phi test confirmed the absence of detectable recombination signal ( P > 0 . 05 , Extended Data Table 1 ) . Bayesian phylogenetic inference . Time - measured phylogeographic histories were reconstructed using a Bayesian phylogenetic inference approach implemented in BEASTv1 . 8 . 2 ( ref . 23 ) . Our full probabilistic model combined sequence substitu - tion over an unknown phylogeny calibrated in time units using a molecular clock process with dated tips 24 , a coalescent tree prior and a discrete diffusion process among discrete location states 25 . For the sequence substitution process , we used the same model as for the maximum likelihood reconstructions . We accommodated rate variation among lineages using a lognormal distribution in an uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock model 26 and integrated out each sampling date over an uncertainty interval of one year . Visual inspections of root to tip divergence as a function of sampling time using TempEst 27 indicated a strong temporal signal with no clear outlier sequences ( Extended Data Fig . 9 ) . For most analyses , we flexibly modelled changes in effective population size through time by specifying a Bayesian skygrid non - parametric tree prior with a grid of 50 years and yearly effective population size parameters 28 . ( The notion of ‘effective population size’ , or ‘effective infections’ in epidemiological applications , comes from population genetics , and is typically lower than the full ( that is , census ) population size , reflecting , for example , variance in reproductive success among individuals—transmissions to new hosts in this context ) . To estimate viral popu - lation growth rates in both the Caribbean and US populations , we fitted a ‘nested’ coalescent model to the data set with the largest taxon sampling ( env 133 ) . This model fits a constant - logistic demographic function 29 to the genealogy excluding the US clade . The initial constant phase was included in the model to accommodate the deep branching between the subtype B sequences and the African subtype D outgroup sequences . Nested within this model , a separate logistic growth model was fitted to the US clade in the genealogy . The process of discrete diffusion among locations was modelled using a general non - reversible substitution model 30 . In our analyses including the African subtype D outgroup lineages , we set the root state frequency to one for the African state and zero for all other possible discrete states . We obtained estimates of the transitions among locations ( Markov jumps ) using a stochastic mapping implementation capable of inferring the complete Markov jump history 31 , 32 . We approximate the posterior distribution for our full probabilistic model using Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) sampling . We use BEAGLE in conjunction with BEAST to improve the computational performance of our analyses 33 . MCMC chains were run for 50 , 000 , 000 generations , sampling every 5 , 000 generations . We diagnosed the runs by examining trace plots and effective samples sizes , and summarized continuous parameters ( mean and 95 % highest posterior density ( HPD ) intervals ) using Tracer ( http : / / tree . bio . ed . ac . uk / software / tracer / ) after discarding a 10 % burn - in . Trees were summarized as maximum clade credibility trees using TreeAnnotator and visualized in FigTree ( http : / / tree . bio . ed . ac . uk / software / figtree / ) . In two specific phylogeographic analyses , we assessed ( i ) to what extent sequences sampled early in the US epidemic characterize the subtype B diversity in the US clade ( Extended Data Fig . 6a ) and ( ii ) to what extent the location state at the origin of the US clade can be estimated using sequences sampled later in the epidemic from three different US states ( Extended Data Fig . 6b ) . For this purpose , we first reconstructed time - measured phylogenies for the env 133 data set using the substitution model , molecular clock model and coalescent model described above and subsequently reconstructed ancestral locations on the inferred posterior distribution of trees . For Extended Data Fig . 6a , we classified US sequences as ‘early’ or ‘late’ depending on whether they were sampled before or after ( and including ) 1985 . For Extended Data Fig . 6b , we first pruned the necessary US sequences from the posterior distributions in order to retain only ‘late’ sequences from New York , North Carolina and California ( matching the sampling from New York , Georgia and California in Fig . 3 and Extended Data Fig . 5b ) . In this case , the support for a NYC ancestral state is likely upheld by the presence of two basal NYC representa - tives , but location estimates in a star - like tree structure with long tip branches will be critically dependent on how well the diversity of any location is represented in the contemporaneous sampling , as recently noted 34 . Comparison of phylogeographic estimates before and after deleting minor recombinant regions from putative recombinants ( Extended Data Table 1 ) indi - cated highly consistent results .

In a , we classified US sequences as ‘early’ or ‘late’ depending on whether they were sampled before or after ( and including ) 1985 . In b , the analysis was conducted on an empirical tree distribution of ‘ env 133’ from which we pruned early US sequences ( in grey ) , but we still annotate the reconstruction on the complete phylogenies for reference .
