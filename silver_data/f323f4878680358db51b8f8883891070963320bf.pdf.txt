Abstract Understanding biomechanics of biological systems is crucial for unraveling complex processes like < ssue morphogenesis . However , current methods for studying cellular mechanics in vivo are limited by the need for specialized equipment and oSen provide limited spa < otemporal resolu < on . Here we introduce two new techniques , Tension by Transverse Fluctua < on ( TFlux ) and in vivo microrheology , that overcome these limita < ons . They both oﬀer < me - resolved , subcellular biomechanical analysis using only ﬂuorescent reporters and widely available microscopes . Employing these two techniques , we have revealed a planar cell polarity ( PCP ) - dependent mechanical gradient both in the cell cortex and the cytoplasm of individual cells engaged in convergent extension . Importantly , the non - invasive nature of these methods holds great promise for its applica < on for uncovering subcellular mechanical varia < ons across a wide array of biological contexts . 3 Introduc1on : Individual cells both generate and sense mechanical forces and the crucial role of single - cell mechanics in the larger - scale emergent processes of < ssue morphogenesis is now well established . That said , the general principles of individual cell mechanics in vivo remain poorly deﬁned , and several hurdles stand between us and a more comprehensive understanding . First , we currently possess only a sparse sampling of subcellular mechanics in embryos , with most work focused on a rela < vely narrow set of cell types and organisms . This limita < on stems in part from the sophis < cated hardware required for exis < ng methods . For example , while atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) , pulsed laser systems , op < cal trapping , micro - aspira < on , and magne < c manipula < on of ferroﬂuids are the core tools of embryo biomechanics analysis in vivo ( Campàs , 2016 ; Davidson , 2011 ; Gjorevski and Nelson , 2010 ; Haase and Pelling , 2015 ; Trier and Davidson , 2011 ; Trubuil et al . , 2021 ) , rela < vely few inves < gators have access to such instrumenta < on . Alterna < ve , imaged - based methods collec < vely termed “force inference” have been developed ( Roca - Cusachs et al . , 2017 ; Roﬀay et al . , 2021 ; Veldhuis et al . , 2015 ) , but these generally rely on cell geometry and force balance across mul < ple cells in any given image at one < me point , which introduce two key limita < ons : The methods have diﬃculty assessing dynamic changes in cell cortex tension over < me and they generally do not provide informa < on on sub - cellular heterogeneity of cortex tension . This second issue is also a more general hurdle , as many commonly used methods do not provide suﬃcient spa < al resolu < on to address the issue of sub - cellular mechanics . For example , the widely used method of laser microdissec < on generally reports only the mean behavior of the en < re junc < on . In the realm of theory , most commonly used vertex models of morphogenesis also treat junc < ons as mechanically homogeneous along their lengths ( Alt et al . , 2017 ; Fletcher et al . , 2014 ) . These are key concerns because evidence from cultured cells , from embryos , and from theory all suggest that individual cell - cell junc < ons can display signiﬁcant mechanical heterogeneity ( Cavanaugh et al . , 2022 ; Huebner et al . , 2021b ; Lieber et al . , 2015 ; Shi et al . , 2018 ; Strale et al . , 2015 ; Vanderleest et al . , 2018 ) . Finally , while we have witnessed an accelera < on of recent work on cell cortex mechanics in embryonic morphogenesis ( e . g . ( Heer and Mar < n , 2017 ; Lecuit and Lenne , 2007 ; Stooke - Vaughan and Campàs , 2018 ) , the mechanical proper < es of the cytoplasm also inﬂuence cell behavior ( Mathieu and Manneville , 2019 ; Salbreux et al . , 2012 ; Wirtz , 2009 ) . For example , local pakerning of cytoplasmic s < ﬀness is important for the movement of ﬁbroblasts and axonal growth cones in vitro ( Kole et al . , 2005 ; O ' Toole et al . , 2008 ) . In vivo , hydraulic behavior of the cytoplasm transmits forces generated at cell - cell junc < ons to form the Drosophila ventral furrow ( He et al . , 2014 ) , and cytoplasmic pressure in Drosophila germ cells tunes the shape of neighboring follicle cells ( Lamiré et al . , 2020 ) . Nonetheless , apart from ini < al samplings in the early embryos of Drosophila and C . elegans ( Daniels et al . , 2006 ; Doubrovinski et al . , 2017 ) , very few studies of cytoplasmic viscosity in embryonic morphogenesis have been reported . Moreover , the rela < onship between the cytoplasmic and cor < cal mechanical proper < es remains an uncharted territory . New tools for the explora < on of these important issues would therefore be welcome . Here , we report two new approaches for quan < fying the mechanical proper < es of the cell cortex and the cytoplasm in vertebrate embryonic cells . Each method enables 1 ) < me - resolved biomechanics in vivo , 2 ) at subcellular scales , 3 ) using only ﬂuorescent reporters and widely available microscopes . Using these tools , we describe and quan < fy planar polarized mechanics of both the cortex and the cytoplasm in individual cells engaged in convergent extension during Xenopus gastrula < on and show that both are 4 dependent on planar cell polarity ( PCP ) signaling . Cri < cally , because these tools require only expression of ﬂuorescent proteins and reasonably high spa < otemporal imaging resolu < on , they should be easily adaptable to other systems , and thus have the poten < al to provide a far broader view of the diversity of cellular and subcellular biomechanics during embryonic morphogenesis . Results : Our desire to develop new methods for single cell biomechanics in vivo was spurred by studies of cell intercala < on during convergent extension ( CE ) , the evolu < onarily conserved collec < ve cell movement that elongates diverse < ssues and organs ( Huebner and Wallingford , 2018 ; Tada and Heisenberg , 2012 ) . In a previous study , we showed that the transverse ﬂuctua < ons of ver < ces provide a convenient proxy for local mechanics ( Huebner et al . , 2021b ) . We therefore reasoned that quan < fying transverse ﬂuctua < on at all pixels along a junc < on might provide a temporally and spa < ally resolved reporter of mechanical heterogeneity ( Fig . 1A ) . TFlux allows subcellular , 1me - resolved assessment of cell cortex tension in vivo . To visualize transverse ﬂuctua < ons of cell cor < ces , we labeled membranes with a ﬂuorescent protein tagged with CAAX , and we imaged cells in the Xenopus gastrula mesoderm with confocal microscopy . We then segmented cells with Ilas < k ® pixel classiﬁca < on and carving ( Berg et al . , 2019 ; Kreshuk and Zhang , 2019 ) to generate 3D ( X - Y - < me ) meshes ( Fig . 1B , C ) . By taking the microscopy at 0 . 31 µm / pixel and 0 . 05 frame / sec , the coarse meshes revealed highly heterogeneous cell behaviors associated with overall cell movement ( Fig . 1C ) . We then increased both spa < al and temporal resolu < on to 0 . 205 µm / pixel and 1 . 0 frame / sec for microscopy , followed the same procedure to generate ﬁner 3D meshes , and used a customized MATLAB script to focus our analysis on junc < on of interest over < me ( Fig . 1D ) . To quan < fy transverse ﬂuctua < ons , we deﬁned a base - line posi < on for each junc < on at each < me point by calcula < ng a moving average in space over 2 µm along the length of the junc < on and in < me over 20 seconds ( Supp . Fig . 1A - C ) . The selec < on of these speciﬁc baseline sampling rates was guided by two key considera < ons : 1 ) In the spa < al domain , we aimed to capture local mechanical heterogeneity imparted by cadherin clusters , which typically act at the 1 µm scale ( Huebner et al . , 2021a ) . Hence , we opted for a 2 µm distance for background smoothing . 2 ) In the temporal domain , we wanted to eliminate overall cell movement as shown in Fig . 1C , so we employed the same 20 - sec interval for temporal background smoothing . Transverse ﬂuctua < on ( TFlux ) was then measured at each < me point as the distance from the junc < on posi < on to the baseline ( Supp . Fig . 1D ) . Consistent with our previous ﬁndings with mul < cellular ver < ces ( Huebner et al . , 2021b ) , Kymographic heatmaps demonstrate that cell - cell junc < ons displayed localized , heterogeneous pakerns of transverse ﬂuctua < on ( Fig . 1E ) . From these data , we deﬁned a “force index” as the reciprocal of the mean square transverse ﬂuctua < on ( Alvarado and Koenderink , 2014 ; MacKintosh et al . , 1995 ) of the junc < on over 2 µm along the length and over a 20 - second period of observa < on ( Fig . 1F ) . This in turn allows us to quan < fy cell cortex tension in both space and < me ( Fig . 1F ) . Importantly , this technique reproduced the mediolateral mechanical heterogeneity reported in our previously work ( Huebner et al . , 2021b ) , but now with addi < onal spa < otemporal insights that warrant further explora < on . 5 To validate TFlux as a relevant metric , we reasoned that cell cortex tension is imparted largely by a contrac < le actomyosin network just below the plasma membrane , and that disrup < on of actomyosin should reduce the TFlux force index . We therefore pharmacologically inhibited myosin using Blebbista < n or ac < n using Latrunculin B ( Morton et al . , 2000 ; Straight et al . , 2003 ; Wakatsuki et al . , 2001 ) and made paired comparisons of the same junc < on before and aSer addi < on of drug ( Fig . 2A , a’ ) . To also test the sensi < vity of TFlux , we used doses of these drugs well below those required to robustly disrupt CE ( Devik et al . , 2023 ; Skoglund et al . , 2008 ) . Cri < cally , even though these low doses elicited no apparent changes in cell shape ( Fig . 2B , b’ ) , they did signiﬁcantly reduce the force index of junc < ons ( Fig . 2C , D ) . As a further test , we asked if TFlux could recapitulate known diﬀerences in cell cortex tension during CE . We previously showed using laser microdissec < on that mediolaterally - aligned “v - junc < ons” display roughly 2 . 1 - fold higher cor < cal tension than do anteroposteriorly aligned “t - junc < ons” ( Fig . 2E , F ) ( Shindo and Wallingford , 2014 ) . Using TFlux , we observed a similar ( 1 . 7 - fold ) diﬀerence in these tensions ( Fig . 2G ) . Together , the ability to detect both the eﬀects of actomyosin disrup < on and known tension diﬀerences determined by laser microdissec < on suggest that TFlux is a sensi < ve and useful method for in vivo analysis of cell cortex mechanics . TFlux reveals a PCP - dependent polarity in cell cortex tension within single cells enaged in convergent extension . To ask if TFlux could provide new insights , we considered that CE requires a superﬁcial “node - and - cable” meshwork of ac < n ( Kim and Davidson , 2011 ; Pﬁster et al . , 2016 ; Skoglund et al . , 2008 ) . Because we recently found this meshwork to be organized diﬀerently in the anterior and posterior regions of single cells ( Devik et al . , 2023 ) , we used TFlux to test the possibility that the anterior and posterior cell cor < ces of each individual cell during CE may experience dis < nct tensions . We labeled the plasma membrane of single cells in an otherwise unlabeled notochord using targeted microinjec < on ( Kieserman et al . , 2010 ) , segmented the anterior and posterior cell membrane , and performed TFlux ( Fig . 3A ) . By taking paired measurements from mul < ple individual cells , we found that the anterior plasma membrane consistently displayed signiﬁcantly elevated cor < cal tension ( i . e . , less transverse ﬂuctua < on and high force index ) compared to the posterior of the same cell ( Fig . 3B , C ) . In our previous study , we also found that the anteroposterior polariza < on of ac < n node - and - cable organiza < on requires the core PCP protein Vangl2 and its downstream eﬀector , the ac < n regulator Sep < n7 ( Devik et al . , 2023 ) . Consistent with a link between the polarity of ac < n organiza < on and the polarity of cell cortex tension , we found that knockdown of either Vangl2 or Sep < n7 eliminated the diﬀerences in cell cortex tension between the anterior and posterior faces of single cells ( Fig . 3D , E ) . Interes < ngly , loss of Vangl2 or Sep < n7 disrupted polariza < on by reducing the elevated tension anteriorly ( i . e . , by causing anterior tensions in experimental cells to resemble posterior tensions in control cells ) ( Fig . 3D , E ) . It’s noteworthy then that Vangl2 or Sept7 KD had a parallel eﬀect on ac < n organiza < on ( Devik et al . , 2023 ) , correla < ng higher order of cytoplasmic ac < n organiza < on with higher cor < cal tension . A phase separated ﬂuorescent report enables in vivo microrheology 6 Combined with an accelera < ng apprecia < on of local mechanical heterogenei < es in cell cortex mechanics ( Cavanaugh et al . , 2022 ; Huebner et al . , 2021b ; Vanderleest et al . , 2018 ) , our ﬁndings with TFlux prompted us to ask if cells displayed similar subcellular heterogeneity in the mechanics of the cytoplasm . We therefore turned to microrheology , which is typically performed with ﬂuorescent microbeads that are tracked over < me providing measurement of mean - squared displacement ( MSD ) that in turn reports cytoplasmic viscosity ( Weihs et al . , 2006 ; Wirtz , 2009 ) . The method has been applied in several cultured cell types ( Daniels et al . , 2006 ; Kole et al . , 2005 ; Weihs et al . , 2006 ; Wirtz , 2009 ) , as well as in Drosophila and C . elegans embryos ( Daniels et al . , 2006 ; He et al . , 2014 ) . However , in the laker cases , analysis was limited to only early stages and few results have been reported . In Xenopus , we found that microbeads clump and are extruded ( not shown ) . We reasoned that phase - separated , droplet - forming proteins may provide a solu < on ( Banani et al . , 2017 ; Shin and Brangwynne , 2017 ) . Indeed , expression of a ﬂuorescent fusion to the phase - separa < ng stress granule protein Tia1 ( Mackenzie et al . , 2017 ) generated discrete , well - dispersed foci in the cytoplasm Xenopus notochord cells ( Fig . 4A ) . Foci remained brightly ﬂuorescent when imaged at 2 frames per second over approximately 2 minutes , allowing eﬀec < ve tracking ( Fig . 4B , b’ ) . Using < me - lapse movies of phase separated foci , we measured MSDs as a func < on of lag < me ( Fig . 4C ) . We performed a rough es < ma < on of the cytoplasmic viscosity , by assuming the Brownian mo < on of the Tia1 - GFP foci , where the MSD of a random walker scales linearly with < me , i . e . diﬀusion ( Weihs et al . , 2006 ; Wirtz , 2009 ) . We es < mated a mean cytoplasmic viscosity of 2 . 20 ± 0 . 20 Poise . Importantly , this values is generally consistent with viscosi < es observed for the cytoplasm of one - cell C . elegans embryos or serum starved 3T3 ﬁbroblasts ( Daniels et al . , 2006 ; Kole et al . , 2005 ; Wirtz , 2009 ) , sugges < ng our method is generally useful for assessing cytoplasmic viscosity in vivo . A PCP - dependent gradient of cytoplasmic viscosity in single cells enaged in convergent extension . We also no < ced that the diﬀusive mo < on of Tia1 - GFP foci was anomalous , in that the MSD follows a sublinear increase with < me , ﬁwng a power - law rela < on with the exponent 𝛼 < 1 . Such a subdiﬀusive mo < on has been proposed as a measure of macromolecular crowding in the cytoplasm ( Weiss et al . , 2004 ) , and recent work has directly linked cytoplasmic crowding with sub - diﬀusivity in both yeast and human cells ( Delarue et al . , 2018 ) . We therefore examined the anomalous diﬀusion exponent 𝛼 to ask if the macromolecular crowding of the cytoplasm of cells engaged in CE displayed a polariza < on similar to that observed for the cell cortex ( Fig . 3 ) and the ac < n cytoskeleton ( Devik et al . , 2023 ) . We found that Tia1 - GFP - labelled foci in the anterior regions of cells consistently displayed highly constrained sub - diﬀusion , with an exponent 𝛼 ~ 0 . 7 ( Fig . 4C , D ) . By contrast , par < cles in the posterior region displayed a signiﬁcantly more diﬀusive movement , with the exponent 𝛼 closer to 1 ( Fig . 4C , D ) . These data suggest that the anterior cytoplasm of a cell engaged in CE is more crowded than the posterior cytoplasm of the same cell . Strikingly , knockdown of either Vangl2 or Sept7 eliminated these anterior - to - posterior diﬀerences in par < cle mo < on , sugges < ng a compromised anterior - to - posterior polarity in the internal organiza < on of the cell ( Fig . 4C , D ) . These eﬀects were not related to any change in the size of Tia - GFP foci in the diﬀerent condi < ons ( Supp . Fig . 2 ) . Vangl2 or Sept7 KD speciﬁcally reduced the normally elevated viscosity in anterior regions , reﬂec < ng similar eﬀect on cortex tension ( Fig . 3 ) and ac < n organiza < on ( Devik et al . , 2023 ) in the anterior regions of these cells . Thus , disrup < on of PCP signaling or its 7 downstream eﬀector Sept7 results in loss of an anteroposteriorly oriented gradient of ac < n organiza < on , cell cortex tension , and cytoplasmic viscosity in individual cells engaged in CE . Discussion : Here , we describe new tools for assessing sub - cellular biomechanics in vivo . We deploy these tools to study convergent extension , a process that was the subject of many seminal studies of < ssue mechanics ( Adams et al . , 1990 ; Feroze et al . , 2015 ; Jacobson and Gordon , 1976 ; Moore et al . , 1995 ; Shook et al . , 2018 ; von Dassow and Davidson , 2009 ; Zhou et al . , 2009 ; Zhou et al . , 2010 ) . More recently , the underlying mechanics of single cells involved in CE have begun to be probed ( Huebner et al . , 2021b ; Shawky et al . , 2018 ; Shindo and Wallingford , 2014 ) , but those studies have been limited , in part due to the limita < ons of exis < ng methods . Using TFlux and in vivo microrheology , we now provide evidence for a PCP - dependent mechanical gradient across each single cell in the Xenopus notochord during CE . The mechanical gradient was observed using tools to probe both the cytoplasm and the cell cortex . These data are signiﬁcant for several reasons . First , they provide a link between the molecular and the mechanical proper < es at a subcellular level during vertebrate CE . Indeed , the core PCP proteins are enriched on the anterior and posterior faces of cells during CE ( Butler and Wallingford , 2018 ; Ciruna et al . , 2006 ; Shindo et al . , 2019 ; Yin et al . , 2008 ) . These , in turn , impart an anteroposterior organiza < on of the ac < n cytoskeleton ( Devik et al . , 2023 ) , and our data here suggest that this in turn imparts a mechanical gradient . Second , this coherent molecular / mechanical gradient adds weight to the idea that very local , sub - cellular mechanical heterogenei < es are important features of cell movement , both in single cultured cells and in < ssues ( Cavanaugh et al . , 2022 ; Huebner et al . , 2021b ; Lieber et al . , 2015 ; Shi et al . , 2018 ; Strale et al . , 2015 ; Vanderleest et al . , 2018 ) . Third , our data suggested that cells are mechanically polarized in two axes , both mediolaterally and anteroposteriorly . The func < ons of such a cellular mechanical pakern warrant further explora < on . Finally , the methods reported here oﬀer broad u < lity . Their non - invasive nature allows the collec < on of < me - resolved data , making them especially akrac < ve for studies of cell movement . Moreover , these techniques require only expression of ﬂuorescent proteins and microscopes with reasonable temporal and spa < al resolu < on , and so should be easily adaptable by many labs to many biological systems . Moreover , the methods are also compa < ble with other image - based approaches , such as assessment of cadherin dynamics using ﬂuorescence recovery aSer photobleaching ( FRAP ) ( Huebner and Wallingford , 2022 ) or membrane tension through ﬂuorescence life < me imaging microscopy ( FLIM ) ( Colom et al . , 2018 ) . Of par < cular interest , the TFlux method opens doors to a more comprehensive understanding of biomechanical and biophysical features in < ssue morphogenesis . In our current analysis , we have chosen speciﬁc baseline smoothing rates to quan < fy transverse ﬂuctua < on . The poten < al for a comprehensive spa < al and temporal analysis of the 3D mesh in Fig . 1C holds great promise for iden < fying addi < onal matrices linked to various cellular and subcellular behaviors and proper < es . Furthermore , while our force index is presently deﬁned based on a model of a semiﬂexible biopolymer at equilibrium pulled at two ends , it is important to acknowledge that cell cortex experiences forces along its en < re length with varia < ons . The method’s u < lity could be further enhanced with a more precise biophysical model . Our aspira < on is that by extending these analyses across mul < ple scales , and exploring diverse < ssue and animal types , we come closer to a more comprehensive understanding of biomechanics in < ssue morphogenesis . 8 Acknowledgements : This work was supported by R01HD099191 and R21HD112657 .

Supplemental Materials and Methods : Xenopus embryo manipula1ons Ovula < on was induced by injec < ng adult female Xenopus laevis with 600 units of human chorionic gonadotropin ( HCG , MERCK Animal Health ) and animals were kept at 16 dc overnight . Eggs were 9 collected the following day by gently squeezing the ovula < ng females , and were fer < lized in vitro . Eggs were dejellied in 2 . 5 % cysteine ( pH 7 . 9 ) 1 . 5 hours aSer fer < liza < on and moved to 1 / 3x Marc’s modiﬁed Ringer’s ( MMR ) media . For micro - injec < on , embryos were placed in 2 % ﬁcoll in 1 / 3x MMR or DI Water during injec < on and moved to 1 / 3x MMR 30 min aSer injec < on . Embryos were injected in the dorsal blastomeres at the 4 - cell stage targe < ng the C1 cells at 32 - cell stage and presump < ve notochord . For mosaic labelling , embryos were injected at the 32 - cell stage targe < ng one of the C1 cells . Keller explants were dissected at stage 10 . 25 in Steinberg’s solu < on using hair tools . Plasmids and mRNA for microinjec1ons Membrane - BFP , membrane - GFP , membrane - RFP plasmids were made in pCS2 + , Lifeact - RFP was made in pCS , and Tia1 - GFP was made in pCS10R . Capped mRNAs were generated using the ThermoFisher SP6 mMessage mMachine kit ( Catalog number : AM1340 ) . The amount of injected mRNAs per blastomere were as follows : Membrane - BFP , membrane - GFP , membrane - RFP or Lifeact - RFP , 60 - 80 pg per injec < on at 4 - cell stage or 8 - 10 pg per injec < on at 32 - cell stage ; Tia1 - GFP , 50 ng per injec < on at 4 - cell stage or 6 ng per injec < on at 32 - cell stage . Inhibitor treatments : Inhibitors were solubilized in DMSO to a stock concentra < on of 2 mM for Latrunculin B ( Cayman Chemical , 10010631 ) and 10 mM for para - amino - Blebbista < n ( Cayman Chemical , 22699 ) . Explants were treated with 0 . 5 µM Latrunculin B or 20 µM of Blebbista < n diluted in Steinberg’s solu < on . Same samples were imaged before and 30 min aSer the addi < on of inhibitors . Imaging Xenopus explants : Explants were submerged in Steinberg’s solu < ons and cultured on glass coverslips coated with Fibronec < n ( Sigma - Aldrich , F1141 ) at 2 µg / cm 2 . All images for TFlux were taken on a laser scanning confocal microscope ( Nikon A1R ) , at the focal plane 5 µm deep into the explant , and at the spa < al and temporal resolu < on of 0 . 205 µm / pixel and 1 . 0 frame / sec , respec < vely . Images for microrheology were taken on a spinning disk confocal microscope ( Nikon W1 ) , at the spa < al and temporal resolu < on of 0 . 130 µm / pixel and 2 frame / sec , respec < vely . Tension by Transverse Fluctua1on ( TFlux ) TFlux measurement is based on the idea that the transverse ﬂuctua < on of a junc < on is inversely propor < onal to tension on the junc < on . To track the junc < on movement , we labeled cell membrane with ﬂuorescent protein tagged with CAAX and imaged on a Nikon A1R confocal microscope for 5 min at the spa < al and temporal resolu < on of 0 . 205 µm / pixel and 1 . 0 frame / sec , respec < vely . Prior to segmenta < on , we preprocessed the < melapse movies in ImageJ following the ﬂowing procedures to improve the cost eﬃciency of segmenta < on : crop region of interest , smooth once , subject background , and adjust contrast without oversatura < on . ASer that , preprocessed < me - lapse movies were imported into Ilas < k® and cells of interest were segmented using Ilas < k® pixel classiﬁca < on and Ilas < k® Carving . 3D ( xyt ) meshes of cells were then imported to a customized MATLAB script to detect the transverse ﬂuctua < on of regions of interest over < me . Brieﬂy , we ﬁrst deﬁned a base - line posi < on of the junc < on at each < me point to account for the overall movement of the cells and the junc < on . To do so , we performed a moving average over 2 µm along the junc < on length at each < me point ( Supp . Fig . 1B ) , and then another moving average over a 20 - sec period in < me ( Supp . Fig . 1C ) . Transverse ﬂuctua < on was then measured at each < me point as the distance from the original junc < on posi < on to the base line ( Supp . Fig . 1D ) . We deﬁned a “force index” as the reciprocal of the mean square transverse ﬂuctua < on ( Alvarado and Koenderink , 2014 ) of the junc < on . For the kymographic heatmap , force index was calculated over 2 µm along the length of the junc < on and over a 20 - second period of observa < on . For 10 the overall junc < on tension , force index was calculated along the en < re junc < on over a 5 - min of observa < on . Par1cle tracking microrheology Par < cle tracking microrheology was performed by tracking the displacement of Tia1 - GFP par < cles using Nikon W1 spinning disk confocal microscope . Time - lapse movies of Tia1 - GFP par < cles in cells co - expressing Lifeact - RFP were taken at the interval of 0 . 5 sec for 5 minutes . Customized MATLAB scripts were used to track the par < cle displacement , and then generate the Mean Square Displacement ( MSD ) , 〈 r ^ 2 ( τ ) 〉 as a func < on of lag < me , τ for each par < cle . We presumed that the MSD data follows the anomalous diﬀusion and thus the MSD follows a power law 〈 r ^ 2 ( τ ) 〉 ∝ τ ^ α . The power law exponent α = 1 for Brownian mo < on ; α < 1 for subdiﬀusion , a sign of macromolecular crowding ; and α > 1 for superdiﬀusion , when par < cle movement is strongly inﬂuenced by other ac < ve cellular movement , such as ac < n ﬂow .
