Schellenberg 15 & Hakon Hakonarson 1 , 11 Autismspectrumdisorders ( ASDs ) are childhood neurodevelopmen - tal disorders with complex genetic origins 1 – 4 . Previous studies focus - ing on candidate genes or genomic regions have identified several copy number variations ( CNVs ) that are associated with an increased risk of ASDs 5 – 9 . Here we present the results from a whole - genome CNVstudyonacohortof859ASDcasesand1 , 409healthychildrenof European ancestrywho were genotyped with 550 , 000single nucleo - tide polymorphism markers , in an attempt to comprehensively identify CNVs conferring susceptibility to ASDs . Positive findings were evaluated in an independent cohort of 1 , 336 ASD cases and 1 , 110 controls of European ancestry . Besides previously reported ASD candidate genes , such as NRXN1 ( ref . 10 ) and CNTN4 ( refs 11 , 12 ) , several new susceptibility genes encoding neuronal cell - adhesion molecules , including NLGN1 and ASTN2 , were enriched with CNVs in ASD cases compared to controls ( P 5 9 . 5 3 10 2 3 ) . Furthermore , CNVs within or surrounding genes involved in the ubiquitin pathways , including UBE3A , PARK2 , RFWD2 and FBXO40 , were affected by CNVs not observed in controls ( P 5 3 . 3 3 10 2 3 ) . We also identified duplications 55kilobases upstream of complementary DNA AK123120 ( P 5 3 . 6 3 10 2 6 ) . Although these variants may be individuallyrare , theytargetgenesinvolvedinneuronalcell - adhesion or ubiquitin degradation , indicating that these two important gene networks expressed within the central nervous system may contri - bute to the genetic susceptibility of ASD . ASDs , including autism , are neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by impairments in social and communication skills , as well as stereotyped and repetitive behaviours and / or a restricted range of interests . Current prevalence estimates in the United States are 0 . 1 – 0 . 2 % for autism and 0 . 6 % for ASDs 1 , 2 . Linkage and candidate gene association studies have implicated several chromosomal regions in autism 3 , 4 . However , positive findings in one study often fail to replicate in other studies , and a consistent picture of susceptibility loci in autism is still lacking . Some telling clues about ASD genetics arose from recent studies on CNVs 5 , includ - ing the association of de novo CNVs with ASDs 6 . Although de novo CNVs that disrupt specific genes may contribute to the pathogenesis of ASDs , heritable CNVs are much more common but have been less studied as risk factors of ASDs . A family - based genome - wide linkage and CNV analysis by the Autism Genome Project Consortium using Affymetrix 10K single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) arrays impli - cated chromosome 11p12 - 13 and neurexin 1 ( NRXN1 ) as candidate loci 7 . A study using the Affymetrix 500K SNP array in a Canadian population reported 277 rare CNVs that were only observed in ASD patients but not in 1 , 652 healthy controls or in the Database of Genomic Variants 8 . Furthermore , 16p11 . 2 deletions and duplica - tions have been reported in independent cohorts of autism patients 9 . These studies concordantly implicate a role for CNVs in the genetic susceptibility to ASDs . To search systematically for CNVs that confer a risk to ASDs , we used a genome - wide approach with the Illumina HumanHap550 BeadChip . We assembled an Autism Case - Control ( ACC ) cohort by collecting 859 ASD cases ( from a total of 1 , 246 ACC cases , parents , and siblings ) of European ancestry , and 1 , 409 healthy controls . Among these case subjects , all met the diagnostic criteria for autism on the basis of Autism Diagnostic Interview ( ADI ) , and 124 met the criteria for other ASDs on the basis of Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule ( ADOS ) 13 . Fifty - four per cent were from simplex families , the rest were from multiplex families . In addition , we also analysed 1 , 336 ASD cases ( from a total of 3 , 398 cases , parents , and siblings ) in the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange ( AGRE ) 14 collection , as well as 1 , 110 control subjects as a replication cohort . Among the AGRE cases , 5 % were from simplex families and 95 % 1 Center for Applied Genomics , Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania 19104 , USA . 2 Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment , Department of Psychiatry , MountSinaiSchoolofMedicine , NewYork , NewYork10029 , USA . 3 UniversityofWashington , Seattle , Washington98105 , USA . 4 DepartmentsofPsychiatryandHuman Genetics , University of Pittsburgh , Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania 15260 , USA . 5 Institute for Juvenile Research and Department of Psychiatry , University of Illinois at Chicago , Chicago , Illinois 60608 , USA . 6 Center for Molecular Neuroscience and Vanderbilt Kennedy Center , Vanderbilt University , Nashville , Tennessee 37235 , USA . 7 Neurodevelopmental Disorders ResearchCenterandDepartmentofPsychiatry , UniversityofNorthCarolina , ChapelHill , NorthCarolina27412 , USA . 8 UniversityofIowa , IowaCity , Iowa52242 , USA . 9 Universityof Utah , Salt Lake City , Utah 84112 , USA . 10 Indiana University , Indianapolis , Indiana 46202 , USA . 11 Department of Pediatrics , Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia , University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania 19104 , USA . 12 Departments of Psychiatry and Neurology , University of Pittsburg School of Medicine , Pittsburg , Pennsylvania 15260 , USA . 13 Dept of Genetics , Biology and Biostatistics , University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania 19104 , USA . 14 Departments of Neuroscience , and Genetics and Genomic Sciences , Mount Sinai School of Medicine , New York , New York 10029 , USA . 15 Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine , University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine , Philadelphia , Pennsylvania 19104 , USA .

All rights reserved ©2009 were from multiplex families : 1 , 202 met the criteria for autism and 134 for other ASDs 13 ( Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 ) . We generated 78 , 490 CNV calls ( 22 , 581 in the ACC series and 55 , 909 in the AGRE series ) from all the ASD subjects and their family members that met strictly established data quality thresholds ( Methods ) . On average , 15 . 5 CNV calls were made for each individual using the PennCNV software 15 , with similar frequency observed in cases and controls ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . We first examined eight genomic regions that have been previously implicated in ASDs . Among those , CNVs involving the 15q11 - 13 , 22q11 . 21 , and NRXN1 regions have well - established associations with autism 10 . CNVsaffecting CNTN4 inASDcaseshavealsobeenreported in independent studies 11 , 12 . We statistically adjusted for relatedness of cases with permutation and our results demonstrate that duplications of 15q11 - q13 and the 22q11 . 21 region , deletions of NRXN1 , as well as deletions and duplications of CNTN4 replicate in our cohorts ( Table 1 ) . Conversely , we did not obtain statistical support for several other genomic regions previously shown to associate with ASD , including AUTS2 ( ref . 16 ) , NLGN3 ( ref . 17 ) , SHANK3 ( ref . 18 ) and 16p11 . 2 ( ref . 9 ) ( Table1 ) . Weobservedasimilarfrequencyofdeletions and duplications of the 16p11 . 2 locus in the ASD cases ( , 0 . 3 % ) as previously reported 9 ; however , the CNV frequency in the control subjects at this locus was also comparable to that of the cases ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . It is noteworthy that CNVs at the 16p11 . 2 locus do not segregate to all cases in three of the affected families and theyarealsotransmittedtounaffectedsiblings ( SupplementaryFig . 4 ) . These results indicate that CNVs at the 16p11 . 2 locus may not be sufficient to be causal variants in ASD . To identify other new genomic loci contributing to ASDs , we applied a segment - based scoring approach that scans the genome for consecutive SNPs with more frequent copy number changes in cases compared to controls . This approach defines copy number variation regions , or CNVRs ( Supplementary Fig . 5 , upper panel ) . In the ACC cohort , we identified four CNVRs that were observed in cases but not in controls , as well as five CNVRs that had significantly higher frequency in cases versus controls ( Table 2 ) . To replicate the CNVRs exclusively observed in ACC cases , we examined the AGRE case - control data set ; of the four case - specific CNVRs , twowere also exclusive to AGRE cases ( PARK2 and RFWD2 ) , whereas the other two ( AK057321 and FBXO40 ) were not observed in either the cases or controls ( combined P values ranging from 3 . 57 3 10 2 6 to 0 . 1 , unadjusted for multiple testing ) ( Table 2 ) . Interestingly , four genes ( UBE3A , PARK2 , RFWD2 and FBXO40 ) that were significantly enriched for CNVs and observed in the ASD cases only , belong to the ubiquitin gene family ( UniProt category ‘Ubl conjugation pathway’ , P 5 3 . 3 3 10 2 3 ) . Theotherfive CNVRs , as well as being enriched in the ACC cases compared with controls , were over - represented in the AGRE cases compared with the independent controls ( Table 2 ) .

ToensurereliabilityofourCNVdetectionmethod , weexperimentally validated all the significant CNVRs using other methods , including quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) and multiplex ligation - dependent probe amplification ( MLPA ) ( Fig . 2 ) . Affymetrix 5 . 0 array data were also available for a subset of the AGRE subjects for validation .

LETTERS NATURE | Vol 459 | 28 May 2009 570 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved ©2009 Besides a segment - based scoring approach for CNV association , an alternative method is the gene - based scoring approach that examines CNV calls affecting any region of the gene ( Supplementary Fig . 5 , lower panel ) . Using this approach , we further identified seven genes with an increased frequency of CNVs in ASD cases versus controls ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . For each gene , most CNVs target different parts of the gene and would have been missed by the segment - based approach . Of note , four of the genes identified by the segment - and gene - basedapproachesareinvolvedinneurondevelopment ( NRXN1 , CNTN4 , ASTN2 and NLGN1 ) ( GeneOntologyterm‘neurondevelop - ment’ , P 5 9 . 5 3 10 2 3 ) . Therefore , by combining evidence from two complementary CNV association approaches , the large sample size has enabled us to implicate two specific gene networks or biological pathways in ASDs : the ubiquitination system and neuronal cell - adhesion molecules . The genes from the ubiquitin pathway ( UBE3A , PARK2 , RFWD2 and FBXO40 ) represent a new CNV finding in ASD susceptibility . Ubiquitination is a post - translational modification which can rapidly alter protein function and target proteins for proteasome - mediated degradation . The ubiquitin – proteasome system operates pre - and post - synaptic compartments , regulating synaptic attributes , including neurotransmitter release , synaptic vesicle recycling in pre - synaptic terminals , and dynamic changes in dendritic spines and the post - synaptic density ( PSD ) 20 . Of the four ubiquitin - related genes highlighted in our study , UBE3A , a ubiquitin protein ligase , has been the most extensively studied in the context of autism . PARK2 is a ubiquitin - protein ligase , mutations of which cause autosomal recess - ive juvenile Parkinson’s disease 21 , and RFWD2 and FBXO40 are also ubiquitin - protein ligases , but neither has been previously associated with disease - causing mutations . The role of ubiquitin in the turnover of synaptic components such as the neuronal cell - adhesion molecules in a process involving regulation of activity - dependent synaptic plas - ticity presents a mechanism that links these two major gene networks . In addition to the genes described above , several ubiquitin - related genes are involved in human neurological diseases . These include NHLRC1 , UBR , CUL4B , BRWD3 and HUWE1 , genes that encode ubiquitin protein E3 ligases .

Genes from the second group of genes implicated in our study , neuronal cell - adhesion molecules , are critical in the development of the nervous system , contributing to axonal guidance , synaptic forma - tion and plasticity , and neuronal – glial interactions . Recent genetic evidence has suggested associations between autism susceptibility and neuronal cell - adhesion molecules , including NRXN1 ( ref . 10 ) , CNTNAP2 ( ref . 23 ) , NLGN3 ( ref . 17 ) , NLGN4X ( ref . 17 ) , and specific cadherins . Our results provide support for some previously reported genes ( NRXN1 and CNTN4 ) , andalsoimplicateadditionalgeneswith cell - adhesion functions , including NLGN1 and ASTN2 . Mutations in neuroligin superfamily members have previously been found in individuals with autism , and have subsequently been shown to be functionally relevant 24 . ASTN1 , a well - studied homologue of ASTN2 , is a neuronal protein receptor integral in the process of glial - guided granule cell migration during development 25 , and ASTN2 deletions have recently been associated with schizophrenia 26 . Using a genome - wide approach for high - resolution CNV detec - tion , we have identified candidate genomic loci with enrichment of CNVsinASDcasesascomparedtocontrols , andhavereplicatedmany of them using an independent set of cases . Most of these genes fall within two pathways / networks involving neuronal cell - adhesion and ubiquitin degradation . The enrichment of genes within these molecu - lar systems suggests new susceptibility mechanisms for ASDs . Our results call for functional and expression assays to be completed to assess the biological effects of CNVs in these candidate genes .
