Good , University of South Florida , St . Petersburg , FL , October 28 , 1997 ( received for review September 2 , 1997 ) ABSTRACT Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome ( WAS ) is an X - linked immunodeficiency caused by mutations that affect the WAS protein ( WASP ) and characterized by cytoskeletal abnormalities in hematopoietic cells . By using the yeast two - hybrid system we have identified a proline - rich WASP - interacting protein ( WIP ) , which coimmunoprecipitated with WASP from lymphocytes . WIP binds to WASP at a site distinct from the Cdc42 binding site and has actin as well as profilin binding motifs . Expression of WIP in human B cells , but not of a WIP truncation mutant that lacks the actin binding motif , increased polymerized actin content and induced the appearance of actin - containing cerebriform projections on the cell surface . These results suggest that WIP plays a role in cortical actin assembly that may be important for lymphocyte function . Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome ( WAS ) is characterized by throm - bocytopenia , eczema , impaired immunity , and a predisposition to develop lymphomas and leukemias ( 1 ) . The size of platelets and lymphocytes is reduced in WAS , and scanning electron microscopy of T lymphocytes shows a relatively smooth surface with decrease in the number and size of microvilli , suggesting a defect in cytoskeletal architecture ( 2 ) . The WAS gene is located on Xp11 . 22 – Xp11 . 23 and encodes a 502 - aa - long pro - line - rich protein ( WASP ) ( 3 ) . WASP contains an N - terminal pleckstrin homology domain , which partially overlaps with a WASP homology ( WH ) domain , WH1 , found in several pro - teins involved in the maintenance of cytoskeletal integrity that include Ena , Mena , Evl , and VASP ( 4 ) . The WH1 domain in WASP is followed by a GTPase binding domain ( GBD y CRIB ) ( 5 ) , a number of proline - rich stretches , a second WH domain ( WH2 ) , a short verprolin homology sequence , a cofilin ho - mology sequence , and an acidic C - terminal region . Recently , a protein homologous to WASP was cloned from bovine brain and was termed N - WASP ( 6 ) . N - WASP has a domain orga - nization similar to that of WASP , and is widely expressed , in contrast to WASP , which is expressed only in hematopoietic cells . WASP binds via its GBD to the small molecular weight GTPase Cdc42 and weakly to Rac but not to Rho ( 7 – 9 ) . Cdc42 , Rac , and Rho regulate cytoskeletal organization ( 10 ) . Over - expression of WASP induces the formation of actin - containing clusters ( 9 ) . This formation is inhibited by dominant negative mutants of Cdc42 , but not of Rac or Rho ( 9 ) . These findings suggest that WASP may provide a link between Cdc42 , Rac , and the cytoskeleton . WASP interacts with components of signal transduction pathways via their Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domains , which recognize the proline - rich domain in WASP ( 11 ) . WASP associates with the adaptor protein Nck ( 12 ) . Nck can be recruited via its SH2 domain to tyrosine phosphorylated receptors ( 13 ) . WASP also binds in vivo to fyn ( 12 , 14 ) and in vitro to the src kinase fgr , to the tyrosine kinases btk , itk , and Abl and to the p85 subunit of PLC - g ( 14 – 16 ) . In an attempt to better understand the function of WASP , we cloned , by using the yeast two - hybrid system , a novel human gene whose 503 - aa product interacts with WASP . We named the protein WIP for WASP - interacting protein . Overexpres - sion of WIP increases F - actin content and induces actin containing structures in the human B cell line BJAB , suggest - ing an important role for WIP in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton . MATERIALS AND METHODS Molecular Cloning of WIP by Using Yeast Two - Hybrid System . Full - length WASP cDNA , obtained by reverse tran - scription – PCR from peripheral blood T cells , sequence veri - fied , and cloned into the bait vector pGBT9 ( CLONTECH ) was used to screen a cDNA library constructed from the human lymphoma T cell line KT3 in the activation domain vector pGAD424 ( 17 ) . Double transformants were selected on Leu 2 , Trp 2 , His 2 plates containing 20 mM aminotriazole to suppress nonspecific background . Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends ( RACE ) . The 5 9 end of WIP cDNA was obtained by RACE . Two nested antisense primers corresponding to nucleotides 487 – 510 ( 5 9 - GCG - GCATTCGGTTCCTCTGAGGCT , WIP - out ) and 452 – 476 ( 5 9 - ACTTCTGTGGCCTGGAGAAGGCACA , WIP - in ) of the WIP cDNA were constructed and used to PCR a RACE - ready library from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( Marathon library , CLONTECH ) along with the anchor prim - ers supplied by the vendor and LA Taq enzyme ( Panvera , Madison , WI ) . The PCR parameters were as follows : dena - turation at 94°C for 30 sec , annealing at 65°C for 1 min , and extension at 68°C for 4 min . Five independent clones derived from three independent PCRs were sequenced to verify the sequence of WIP cDNA . Sequence analysis was performed by using the GCG version 8 . 1 package ( Genetics Computer Group , Madison , WI ) . The BLAST and the FASTA programs were used to search the GenBank databases at the National Center for Biotechnology Information . Northern Blot Analysis of WIP mRNA Expression . Human multiple tissue Northern blots were purchased from CLON - TECH . After overnight hybridization with radiolabeled full - length WIP cDNA , the blots were washed with 0 . 5 3 SSC The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

Glutathione S - Transferase ( GST ) and Maltose Binding Protein ( MBP ) Fusion Proteins . To obtain the GST - WASP 1 – 270 construct , cDNA coding for amino acids 1 – 270 of WASP was amplified by PCR using Pfu polymerase ( Stratagene ) and oligonucleotides with Eco RI ( 5 9 end ) or Sal I ( 3 9 end ) recog - nition sequence and cloned into Eco RI – Sal I - digested pGEX4T1 ( Pharmacia ) . MBP fusion construct of WIP 4 ( MBP - WIP4 ) was made by ligating WIP4 ( a clone of WIP obtained by two - hybrid screen , see Results ) cDNA excised from pGAD424 by digestion with Eco RI and Bgl II to Eco RI – Bam HI - digested pMAL - c2 expression vector ( New England Biolabs ) . GST - WIP2 construct was made by ligating WIP2 cDNA excised from the yeast vector pGAD424 by Eco RI – Bgl II digestion to Eco RI – Bam HI - digested pGEX4T1 . All expres - sion constructs were verified by DNA sequence analysis and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 for the expression of the fusion proteins . Expression of fusion proteins was induced as follows : GST - WASP 1 – 270 expression was induced for 2 hr with 0 . 075 mM isopropyl b - D - thiogalactoside ( IPTG ) . After induction , the bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation , suspended in GST - lysis buffer [ 20 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 y 150 mM NaCl y 1 mM EDTA y 1 mM DTT y 0 . 5 % Nonidet P - 40 y protease inhibitor mixture ( Complete , Boehringer Mannheim y 0 . 1 % lysozyme ] and lysed by sonication ( 3 3 15 sec ) . The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 10 , 000 3 g for 5 min at 4°C . GST expression was induced by addition of 0 . 1 mM IPTG , and the cells were processed as above . MBP - WIP4 was induced with 0 . 3 mM isopropyl b - D - thiogalactoside ( IPTG ) for 16 hr at 30°C . MBP - M was induced with 0 . 3 mM IPTG for 2 hr at 37°C . Bacteria were collected by centrifugation and suspended in 1 y 20 growth volume in E . coli lysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 y 200 mM NaCl y 1 mM EDTA with protease inhibitors ) and frozen at 2 20°C for 2 hr . The suspensions were thawed , sonicated ( 3 3 15 sec ) , and centri - fuged for 20 min at 10 , 000 3 g and 4°C . The supernatants were used in affinity precipitation experiments . In Vitro Binding Assay Using GST and MBP Fusion Pro - teins . Supernatant of bacterial cell lysates containing GST or GST - WASP 1 – 270 fusion protein was mixed with supernatant of bacterial cell lysates containing MBP - WIP4 or MBP - M for 20 min . at 4°C . One half of the mixture was tumbled with glutathione beads and the other with amylose resin at 4°C for 40 min . The beads were washed thrice with tris - buffered saline containing 0 . 5 % Tween 20 , and the beads were suspended in 1 3 Laemmli PAGE buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis . Generation of WIP Expressing BJAB Cells . WIP and WIP4 cDNAs were cloned into modified pcDNA3 vector that ex - presses cloned cDNA as a N - terminal FLAG fusion protein ( gift of V . Ramesh , Massachusetts General Hospital , Boston , MA ) . Twenty micrograms of plasmid were used to transfect 30 3 10 6 BJAB cells by electroporation ( 1 , 600 m F , 200 V ) , and cells were selected in medium containing 1 . 5 mg y ml G418 ( GIBCO y BRL ) . The surviving cells were cloned by plating at 0 . 3 cells y well in a 96 - well plate . The clones were checked for WIP4 expression by Western blotting with anti - FLAG . Be - cause full - length WIP - FLAG did not transfer for immunoblot - ting , expression of WIP - FLAG was ascertained by PCR and by the presence of WASP in anti - FLAG immunoprecipitates . Affinity Precipitation of WASP and Profilin from Cell Lysates by WIP . BJAB cells were washed twice with serum - free RPMI 1640 medium and suspended on ice for 30 min in lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 y 150 mM NaCl y 1 mM EDTA y 30 % glycerol y 0 . 4 mM sodium orthovanadate y 10 mM NaF y 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate y protease inhibitor mix - ture y 1 % Brij 96 , Sigma ) at 40 3 10 6 cells y ml . Lysates were centrifuged at 16 , 000 3 g for 15 min at 4°C and precleared for 1 hr with 25 m l of GSH - Sepharose ( Pharmacia ) . Supernatants were tumbled for 16 hr with ’ 1 m g of GST - WIP2 immobilized on glutathione beads . The beads were washed three times with modified lysis buffer containing 10 % glycerol and 0 . 2 % Brij 96 ( wash buffer ) , suspended in Laemmli loading buffer , and subjected to PAGE on 10 % or 4 – 15 % gradient gels and Western blotting . The blots were developed with rabbit anti - WASP peptide antiserum and protein A - HRP or with anti - profilin rabbit antibody . Immunoprecipitation of FLAG - WIP from BJAB Cells . BJAB cells transfected with WIP or with pcDNA3 vector were washed twice with serum - free RPMI 1640 medium and lysed ( 40 3 10 6 cells y ml ) in ice - cold lysis buffer ( 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 y 150 mM NaCl y 1 mM EDTA y 1 % Triton X - 100 y 1 % so - dium deoxycholate y 0 . 1 % SDS y 1 mM sodium orthovana - date y 50 mM NaF y 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride ) . The lysates were incubated at 4°C overnight with 7 m g of anti - FLAG M2 antibody ( Kodak - IBI ) preadsorbed onto 40 m l of protein G Sepharose ( Pharmacia ) . The precipitates were washed four times with wash buffer , eluted in Laemmli loading buffer , and subjected to SDS y PAGE on 4 – 15 % gradient gels and Western blot analysis with anti - FLAG mAb or anti - WASP antiserum . Determination of Polymerized Actin Content . F - actin con - tent was estimated by flow cytometry using fluorescein iso - thiocyanate ( FITC ) - phalloidin ( 18 ) . The fluorescence of FITC - phalloidin in this assay is proportional to the amount of F - actin . Cells were fixed with 2 % paraformaldehyde , perme - abilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , and labeled with FITC - phalloidin for 30 min at room temperature . The samples were immediately read in a Becton - Dickinson Excalibur flow cy - tometer . The samples were gated for live lymphocytes accord - ing to forward and side scatter profiles . Immunofluorescence Microscopy . Cells were fixed with 3 . 7 % paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 30 min , washed twice with PBS , and permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS at room temperature for 20 min . The cells were incubated with 2 m M tetramethylrhodamine B isothio - cyanate - conjugated phalloidin ( Sigma ) for 1 hr at 37°C . The cells were washed twice with PBS , examined , and photo - graphed in a fluorescent microscope ( Olympus ) . RESULTS Molecular Cloning of WIP . We used the yeast two - hybrid system to search for novel WASP interacting protein ( s ) . A cDNA library from the human lymphoma T cell line KT3 was constructed in the activation domain vector pGAD424 ( 17 ) and was screened in the yeast two - hybrid system by using full - length WASP cDNA . Six clones that grew on Leu 2 Trp 2 His 2 plates also tested positive for b - galactosidase with blue color developing in less than 30 min . The two largest cDNAs , designated WIP2 ( 1 . 7 kb ) and WIP4 ( 1 . 6 kb ) , were chosen for further detailed characterization . DNA sequence analysis re - vealed that WIP2 and WIP4 cDNAs are products of the same gene because the WIP4 protein coding sequence was com - pletely contained within WIP2 ( Fig . 1 A ) . The 3 9 - untranslated region of WIP4 was 0 . 5 kb larger than that of WIP2 . Genbank database search revealed that WIP is virtually identical to Prpl2 , a partial human cDNA isolated from tonsillar B cells whose function is unknown ( accession number X86019 ) . The last seven amino acids of the predicted Prpl2 protein are replaced in WIP by 17 amino acids of a different sequence ( Fig . 1 A ) . In addition , there is a deletion of one amino acid ( aa 270 of the Prpl2 sequence ) . Both of these differences are unlikely to be cloning artifacts because they are found in both WIP2 and WIP4 , which were isolated during independent screenings . The 5 9 end of the WIP mRNA was obtained by rapid ampli - fication of cDNA ends , by using a peripheral blood leukocyte cDNA library . Fig . 1 B shows the deduced amino acid sequence 14672 Immunology : Ramesh et al . Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 94 ( 1997 ) of WIP . The predicted protein product is a 503 - aa - long proline - rich protein with a calculated molecular mass of ’ 52 kDa . The N - terminal region contains two stretches , 28 and 17 aa residues in length , that are highly homologous to corre - sponding amino acid stretches in the N - terminal region of the yeast protein verprolin ( Fig . 1 C ) . Verprolin is involved in cytoskeletal organization because vrp1 2 conditional mutants fail to grow at the restrictive temperature of 37°C , have abnormal actin formation and chitin deposition , and are defective in bud formation ( 19 ) . Of note is the presence of the KLKK motif in the first WIP verprolin homology domain . This motif originally was identified in thymosin - b 4 as a motif that is critical for actin binding ( 20 ) . Identical , or similar ( KLRK , KLRR ) motifs , are present in the putative actin binding protein members of the Ena y VASP family ( 4 ) raising the possibility that WIP may interact directly with actin . In addi - tion , WIP contains two APPPPP sequences ( denoted by p in Fig . 1 B ) , which have been shown to bind profilin ( 21 ) , a protein that regulates actin polymerization . WIP contains a number of putative SH3 binding motifs with the sequence PPP C XP . A unique proline - rich motif , GRSG - PXPPXP , is repeated three times in WIP ( Fig . 1 D ) . This motif recurs twice in WASP and has been implicated in the binding of WASP to the SH3 domain containing proteins fyn , fgr , and phospholipase C g 1 ( 16 ) . The presence of conserved SH3 binding motifs in WIP suggests that WIP may link the signal transduction machinery to the cytoskeleton . WIP Associates with WASP Both in Vitro and in Vivo . To confirm the association of WASP and WIP , we first examined the interaction of WASP and WIP expressed as recombinant bacterial fusion proteins with GST and MBP , respectively . GSH - Sepharose retained MBP - WIP after incubation with a mixture of MBP - WIP and GST - WASP , indicating binding of WIP to WASP ( Fig . 2 A ) and suggesting that posttranslational modification of these proteins is not necessary for their interaction .

WASP 1 – 270 , WIP4 , and the control protein M were expressed in E . coli as fusion proteins with GST or MBP . Soluble extracts from induced bacteria were mixed , and the fusion proteins were affinity - precipitated by using glutathione beads , or amylose resin , run on 4 – 15 % gradient SDS y PAGE , and examined for the presence of MBP fusion proteins by Western blotting with rabbit anti - MBP antiserum . The blots were developed by using protein A conjugated to horseradish peroxidase followed by ECL . The position of MBP - WIP is indicated by a dot . Note that the molecular masses of MBP - WIP and the control MBP - M proteins are similar . The lower molecular bands represent degradation products of the fusion proteins . The presence of GST - WASP 1 – 270 in lanes 3 and 5 and GST in lane 7 was confirmed by Western blotting with anti - GST mAb ( data not shown ) . ( B ) Affinity precipitation of endogenous WASP by GST - WIP . Lysates of BJAB cells were incu - bated with GSH - Sepharose beads coupled to GST - WIP2 or GST . Bound proteins were eluted , run on 10 % SDS y PAGE , and examined for the presence of WASP by immunoblotting with rabbit anti - WASP peptide antibody . The blots were developed as described in A . ( C ) In vivo association of WIP and WASP . FLAG - tagged full - length WIP cDNA was transfected into BJAB cells , and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with M2 anti - FLAG mAb , blotted , and probed with anti - WASP peptide antibody . Immunology : Ramesh et al . Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 94 ( 1997 ) 14673 human B cell line BJAB binds to purified recombinant GST - WIP2 ( Fig . 2 B ) . More importantly , WIP and WASP were shown to associate in cells . Fig . 2 C shows that a protein band corresponding to WASP was detected in anti - FLAG immu - noprecipitates from BJAB cells transfected with full - length FLAG - WIP cDNA , but not in anti - FLAG immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with empty vector . WASP was not detected in control MOPC21 ( mouse IgG1 ) immunoprecipi - tates from FLAG - WIP transfected BJAB cells ( data not shown ) . WASP binds to activated Cdc42 at a conserved GBD ( amino acids 238 – 257 ) ( 7 – 9 ) . To map the WIP binding site , trunca - tions of WASP were examined for WIP binding in the yeast two - hybrid system . The results show that the WIP binding region lies within the N - terminal 170 amino acids of WASP ( Fig . 3 A ) . Because this region lacks the GBD ( amino acids 238 – 257 ) , the WIP binding site on WASP is distinct from the Cdc42 binding site . Neither the WASP 1 – 137 truncation mutant , which contains the WH1 domain , nor the proline - rich amino acid 139 – 270 region were able to bind WIP . Thus , both of these regions are necessary but not sufficient for WIP binding . Deletion of the N - terminal 46 amino acids , which disrupt the pleckstrin homology domain , but not the WH1 domain , sharply reduced the affinity of WASP for WIP , suggesting that amino acids 1 – 46 are required for optimal binding to WIP . Curiously , the majority of point mutations in patients with WAS are located in the WH1 domain , although this domain makes up only 18 % of the WASP sequence ( 22 ) . Mutations in the WH1 domain potentially could disrupt the association of WASP with WIP , raising the possibility that interaction of WASP with WIP may be critical for WASP function . The carboxy terminal 183 amino acid of WIP , i . e . , WIP4 ( aa 321 – 503 ) are sufficient for WASP binding . To further localize the binding site of WASP on WIP , truncation mutants of WIP4 were constructed and examined for binding to WASP in the yeast two - hybrid system ( Fig . 3 B ) . The results show that the WASP binding region lies within aa 377 – 503 of WIP . WIP Is Expressed Hematopoietic and Nonhematopoietic Tissues . The expression of WIP transcripts in human tissues was analyzed by Northern blot analysis of poly ( A ) 1 RNA from a panel of tissues that used full - length WIP cDNA as probe . Fig . 4 shows that three species of mRNA with estimated sizes of 2 . 4 kb , 3 . 5 kb , and 5 kb are present in all tissues tested . The different RNA species could represent a family of proteins or differently spliced y polyadenylated mRNA . Because the RNA bands are evident even when washed at relatively stringent condition ( 0 . 5 3 SSC , 0 . 5 % SDS ) , it suggests that the different bands are probably splice variants . The level of expression of the WIP transcripts is highest in peripheral blood mononuclear cells with the 2 . 4 - kb species expressed at a higher level than the other two species . Expression of WIP in nonhematopoietic tissues , which do not express WASP , suggests that WIP may have other interaction partners than WASP . Expression of WIP Causes Actin Polymerization . WIP con - tains the highly charged KLKK sequence ( amino acids 45 – 48 ) in its N - terminal verprolin homology domain , immediately preceded by a region that could fold as an a - helix . This motif mediates contact between G - actin and thymosin b 4 ( 20 ) . WIP also contains two copies of the actin - based motility sequence ABM - 2 , APPPPP , which has been implicated in binding to profilin in VASP and Mena ( 4 , 23 ) . One of the two profilin binding motifs in WIP ( amino acids 8 – 13 ) is located in relative proximity to the G - actin binding motif as found in the Ena y VASP family of proteins . Simultaneous binding of G - actin and profilin by Ena y VASP is thought to promote actin polymer - ization ( 4 ) . To examine the role of WIP on actin polymeriza - tion , the effect of overexpression of WIP on F - actin content was examined in B lymphocytes . FLAG - tagged full - length WIP and FLAG - tagged WIP4 ( amino acids 321 – 503 ) were cloned into pcDNA3 and transfected into BJAB cells . Trans - fected cells were selected by using the antibiotic G418 and cloned . To ascertain the expression of FLAG - WIP proteins , cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti - FLAG mAb M2 . F IG . 3 .

The numbers under the bar at the bottom of the diagram represent the amino acids of WASP . Truncation mutants of WASP , generated either by PCR or cleavage with appropriate restriction enzymes , were cloned into the pGBT9 vector and examined for WIP binding in the yeast two - hybrid system . Blue color develop - ment by b - galactosidase activity was used to score the interaction of WIP with WASP truncations . 111 represents color change in 30 min or less , 1 represents color change in 3 hr , and 2 indicates no color change and lack of growth in His 2 medium .

Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 94 ( 1997 ) The FLAG - WIP4 product was readily detectable in cell lysates ( data not shown ) and in immunoprecipitates with anti - FLAG M2 mAb as shown for the representative clone I in Fig . 5 A ( Left ) . Despite multiple attempts using a number of immuno - blotting conditions , the full - length FLAG - WIP product could not be immunoblotted ( Fig . 5 A , Center ) , possibly because of its very high proline content . However , as illustrated in Fig . 5 A ( Right ) for the representative clone 3 , we were able to dem - onstrate the presence of WASP in anti - FLAG immunopre - cipitates from FLAG - WIP - transfected cells , providing evi - dence for expression of tagged WIP protein that interacted with WASP . Expression of FLAG - WIP mRNA also was ascertained in several clones by reverse transcription – PCR . F - actin content was assessed by staining permeabilized cells with FITC - conjugated phalloidin followed by flow cytometry analysis . Table 1 shows that there was an increase in baseline F - actin content in BJAB cell clones that overexpressed full - length WIP , but not in control transfected cells . The effect of WIP overexpression on F - actin content was dependent on the N - terminal region of WIP . Overexpression of WIP4 , which lacks the first 320 amino acids and thus lacks the actin binding KLKK motif and one of two profilin binding ABM - 2 se - quences , did not cause an increase in F - actin content . It previously was shown that overexpression of WASP causes the formation of cytosolic aggregates containing F - actin and WASP ( 9 ) . The effect of WIP overexpression on F - actin distribution was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy of permeabilized BJAB cells stained with tetramethylrhodam - ine B isothiocyanate - phalloidin . Fig . 5 B shows that F - actin is uniformly distributed around the cortex in untransfected cells ( control ) and in cells transfected with pcDNA3 . In contrast , in clone 3 , which overexpresses full - length FLAG - tagged WIP , the cell surface was covered with cerebriform projections containing actin . The cerebriform nature of the projections is reflected in the lacey staining pattern . Formation of surface projections and the increase in F - actin content were dependent on the N - terminal region of WIP , because F - actin staining in clones that overexpress WIP4 was indistinguishable from that of control cells . GST - WIP Affinity Precipitates Endogenous Profilin . In light of the capacity of WIP to increase F - actin content , the critical role of profilin in actin polymerization ( 24 , 25 ) , and the presence of profilin binding motifs in WIP , we examined the capacity of WIP to bind profilin . Fig . 6 shows that profilin is readily detected in lysates of BJAB cells by immunoblotting with rabbit anti - profilin antibody . GST - WIP2 , but not GST , retained endogenous profilin after incubation with BJAB cell lysate . DISCUSSION We have identified a novel gene whose product , WIP , associ - ates with WASP . WIP mRNA is expressed in many tissues although its level of expression varies between tissues . The finding that WASP is expressed only in hematopoietic cells suggests that WIP may interact with partners other than WASP . e . g . , N - WASP , which we recently showed to interact with WIP ( data not shown ) . Overexpression of WIP exerts powerful effects on the actin cytoskeleton , which include increase in the cellular content of polymerized actin and appearance of cerebriform projections on the cell surface containing F - actin .

The F - actin content represents the mean ratio of the F - actin content in transfected cells to that in untransfected BJAB cell in four experi - ments . t tests revealed that FLAG - WIP clones 2 , 3 , and 4 were significantly higher ( P # 0 . 001 ) . There was no significant difference between clone A . 11 and clone I ( P 5 0 . 20 ) . Immunology : Ramesh et al . Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 94 ( 1997 ) 14675 actin cytoskeleton required the N - terminal end of the mole - cule ( amino acids 1 – 320 ) , which contains the actin binding KLKK motif . A number of proteins have been shown to assemble into a spatial actin monomer delivery system . These proteins , which include Mena and VASP , bind profilin via a proline - rich ABM - 2 motif , XPPPPP , where X denotes G , A , L , or S ( 4 , 21 , 23 ) . The sequence APPPPP is represented twice in WIP , once at the N - terminal end and once in the C - terminal region ( Fig . 1 B ) . Immobilized WIP bound profilin from cell lysates ( Fig . 6 ) , suggesting a direct interaction of WIP with profilin . Recombinant profilin was affinity - precipitated from bacterial cell lysates by MBP - WIP , further indicating that WIP interacts directly with profilin ( data not shown ) . Thus , WIP may modulate actin dynamics by direct interaction with actin , via the KLKK motif , as well as with profilin , and possibly with other proteins that regulate actin polymerization , such as WASP . The platelet and lymphocytes structural abnormalities in WAS support a functional link between WASP and the actin cytoskeleton . In addition , T lymphocytes from WAS patients fail to proliferate to immobilized anti - CD3 ( 15 ) , a response that depends on actin cytoskeleton rearrangement ( 26 , 27 ) . The mechanism by which WASP modulates the actin cytoskel - eton is unclear . Although WASP overexpression induces the actin clusters that contain WASP ( 9 ) , no evidence exists for direct interaction between WASP and actin ; however , N - WASP has been shown to interact with actin in vitro ( 9 ) . Because WIP binds WASP and overexpression of WIP induces actin cytoskeletal changes , WIP may play an important role in linking WASP to the actin cytoskeleton . The actin - binding KLKK motif and one of the two profilin - binding ABM - 2 motifs in WIP are located in proximity to each other , just as they are in members of the Ena y VASP family . Simultaneous binding of profilactin by WIP may promote actin polymeriza - tion by increasing the local concentration of actin monomers . Actin polymerization by a WASP - WIP complex may be further enhanced by the recruitment of profilin to the ABM - 2 motifs in WASP . Cytoskeletal rearrangement is triggered by a variety of signaling pathways induced by external stimuli such as growth factors , stress , and adhesion through integrins ( 28 ) , and is mediated by small GTPases . WIP does not contain any dis - cernible GBD ; thus direct interaction of WIP with GTPases is unlikely . However , WASP may bridge Cdc42 to WIP , allowing Cdc42 to regulate WIP function . The WASP - WIP complex may get targeted by stimuli that activate Cdc42 to locate to the actin cytoskeleton via interactions between the WH1 domain of WASP and the proline - rich ABM - 1 motifs of structural proteins such as zyxin and vinculin ( 21 ) . The presence of SH3 binding motifs in both WIP and WASP suggests that the WASP - WIP complex couples additional signaling pathways to the actin cytoskeleton .
