l e t t e r s Actin - driven chromosomal motility leads to symmetry breaking in mammalian meiotic oocytes Hongbin Li 1 , Fengli Guo 1 , Boris Rubinstein 1 and Rong Li 1 , 2 Movement of meiosis I ( MI ) chromosomes from the oocyte centre to a subcortical location is the first step in the establishment of cortical polarity . this is required for two consecutive rounds of asymmetric meiotic cell divisions , which generate a mature egg and two polar bodies 1 . Here we use live - cell imaging and genetic and pharmacological manipulations to determine the force - generating mechanism underlying this chromosome movement . Chromosomes were observed to move toward the cortex in a pulsatile manner along a meandering path . this movement is not propelled by myosin - II - driven cortical flow but is associated with a cloud of dynamic actin filaments trailing behind the chromosomes / spindle . Formation of these filaments depends on the actin nucleation activity of Fmn2 , a formin - family protein that concentrates around chromosomes through its amino - terminal region . symmetry breaking of the actin cloud relative to chromosomes , and net chromosome translocation toward the cortex require actin turnover . Oocyte meiotic divisions are highly asymmetric , and symmetry breaking initiates with chromosome movement from the oocyte centre towards the cortex in many vertebrate and invertebrate organisms 1 , 2 . The subcor - tically located chromosomes then elicit a signal to induce assembly of an actomyosin - rich cortical domain for polar - body extrusion , as shown in mouse oocytes 3 . Chromosomal translocation to the cortex is micro - tubule - dependent in Caenorhabditis elegans , Drosophila melanogaster and sea cucumber oocytes 2 , 4 , 5 , but in mouse oocytes , is known to rely on F - actin 6 , 7 . The actin cytoskeleton drives cellular and intracellular motility through three distinct mechanisms . First , actin filaments or bundles serve as oriented tracks for transport motors , such as myosin V 8 . This form of actin - based motility is used to traffic cellular organelles and membrane vesicles . Second , contractile networks consisting of actin and type II myosin can drive cortical flow and transport of signalling complexes 9 and structures such as centrosomes 10 . A contractile actin network is also thought to drive the first phase of chromosome con - gression in starfish oocytes 11 . Third , actin can generate propulsive force directly through polymerization at filament barbed ends . This type of mechanism is crucial for leading - edge movement in motile cells , as well as intracellular movement of certain vesicles and pathogens , such as Listeria monocytogenes and vaccinia virus 12 . We first used four - dimensional ( 4D ) tracking to obtain quantita - tive parameters characterizing this process . DNA was stained with Hoechst bisbenzamide in live MI oocytes at a low concentration that had no toxic effects ( see Methods ) . 4D imaging was performed using a two - photon microscope , and the movement of chromosomes towards the cortex after formation of the metaphase plate was tracked at 5 - min intervals using the Imaris software ( Fig . 1a ; Supplementary Information , Movies 1 , 2 ) . Along the initial position - destination ( ID ) axis ( Fig . 1b ) , the displacement of meiotic chromosomes increased with time ( Fig . 1c ) , with an average total displacement of 17 . 0 ± 1 . 8 µm ( n = 16 ) and an aver - age velocity of 0 . 05 ± 0 . 01 µm min – 1 ( velocity = displacement / time ) . However , the average length of the path covered by the movement was much larger , 46 . 4 ± 4 . 7 µm , with an average speed of 0 . 13 ± 0 . 01 µm min – 1 ( speed = path length / time ) . The straightness of the path , defined as displacement / path length , for chromosomes in each oocyte is shown in Fig . 1d and averaged 0 . 37 ± 0 . 05 ( Table 1 ) . The efficiency of movement during each time - interval was further analysed using a correlation analy - sis to generate a Pearson’s coefficient ( see Methods ) between speed and displacement ( Fig . 1d ) . This coefficient should be close to 1 for movement with maximum straightness ; however , the average Pearson’s coefficient was 0 . 50 ± 0 . 13 , suggesting that the movement was inefficient . We plotted the angle of direction change between two consecutive time - points ( θ ) over time ( Fig . 1b ) . There were large changes in θ along the movement path for all oocytes ( Fig . 1e ) , suggesting that the movement was unlikely to be guided by a straight pre - established actin track . We next examined the pattern of speed during chromosome movement to the cortex . The average speed was highly consistent ( Fig . 1f ; Table 1 ) ; however , chromosome speed in individual oocytes oscillated between about 0 . 06 µm min – 1 and 0 . 25 µm min – 1 in the course of the movement ( Fig . 1g ) . The pulsatile motion can be more easily seen in the example in Fig . 1h , which shows an average periodicity ( time between two adjacent peaks ) of 14 . 6 min . The average periodicity in speed for all oocytes observed was 15 . 0 ± 0 . 7 min ( n = 16 ) . This periodic pattern of movement was previously observed for the actin polymerization - driven motility of certain Listeria mutants and large beads coated with an Arp2 / 3 complex activator 13 , 14 . 1 Stowers Institute for Medical Research , 1000 E . 50th Street , Kansas City , MO 64110 , USA . 2 Correspondence should be addressed to R .

We first confirmed that treatment of oocytes with the actin polymerization inhibitor latrunculin A ( Lat A ) ( 10 µM ) completely abolished chromosome migration , pro - ducing an average displacement of 2 . 0 ± 1 . 2 µm ( Fig . 2a ; Table 1 ) and an average speed of 0 . 04 ± 0 . 03 µm min – 1 ( n = 15 ) , compared with 0 . 13 ± 0 . 01 µm min – 1 for untreated oocytes ( Fig . 2b ; Table 1 ) . Treatment of oocytes with nocodazole to depolymerize microtubules resulted in even faster chromosome movement , compared with untreated oocytes ( Table 1 ; Supplementary Information , Fig . S1a , b ) .

As these inhibitors can be absorbed by mineral oil , the treatments were performed in medium without oil , which did not permit time - lapse imaging of the movement . Neither ML - 7 ( 20 µM ) nor blebbistatin ( 50 – 75 µM ) blocked chromosome move - ment to the cortex ( Fig . 2c ) . At this concentration range , blebbistatin completely inhibited polar - body extrusion , suggesting that myosin II motor activity was dispensable for chromosome movement to the cortex . Wheat germ agglutinin ( WGA ) , a lectin that binds to cell sur - face glycoproteins and thus blocks cortical flow 10 , also had no effect , as shown with 4D tracking , even though WGA completely blocked polar body extrusion ( Fig . 2c ; Table 1 ) . This further suggests a lack of involvement of cortical flow in chromosome movement . To test whether dynamic actin is required for chromosome migra - tion , oocytes were treated with the actin depolymerization inhibitor jasplakinolide ( Jas ) . The effect of Jas treatment was similar to that of Lat A on chromosome migration to the cortex , with an average displacement of 3 . 0 ± 0 . 4 µm ( Table 1 ) . No cell division or polar - body extrusion was observed ( data not shown ) . However , in Jas - treated oocytes , meiotic chromosomes moved at a higher average speed ( 0 . 09 ± 0 . 03 µm min – 1 ) than in Lat A - treated cells ( Fig . 2b ; Table 1 ) . Comparison of the trajectories of chromosome movement in control and Lat A - treated oocytes showed significant chromosome movement in Jas - treated oocytes , but the net displacement was minimal due to constant changes in direction ( Fig . 2d ; Supplementary Information , Movie 3 ) . This result suggests that actin turnover may be important for a decisive symmetry - breaking event , which is required for persistent movement towards the cortex . It is well documented that actin filaments are present on the cortex of mouse oocytes after germinal vesicle breakdown . After chromosomes have moved to the cortex , actin forms a cortical cap 6 , 7 ; however , pre - vious studies with phalloidin - labelling were unable to show F - actin in the vicinity of chromosomes in the cytosol 7 , 15 , 16 ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S1a ) . To immunostain mouse oocytes for actin , we used anti - β - actin as the primary antibody and FluoNanogold - anti - mouse Fab ´ - Alexa Fluor 488 as the secondary antibody . In addition to cortical actin , cytosolic patches of actin were observed 6 h after release from the interphase arrest , some apparently in the vicinity of the chro - mosomes ( Fig . 3a ; Supplementary Information , Movie 4 ) . This stain - ing was further confirmed using pre - embed labelling immuno - electron microscopy after gold enhancement ( Fig . 3b ) . However , the paucity of actin structures observed suggests that cytosolic actin in oocytes may be too dynamic to preserve under formaldehyde fixation . To observe F - actin during chromosome movement in live oocytes , we used the recently developed Lifeact peptide , which binds specifically to F - actin but does not alter actin dynamics 17 . Oocytes injected with FITC - labelled Lifeact ( F - Lifeact ) showed chromosome movement with normal speed and displacement ( Table 1 ) . In the FITC channel , a cloud of F - actin occupying a circular area , with a radius of about 12 – 18 µm , was observed around the meiotic chromosomes after germinal vesicle breakdown ( Fig . 3c , d ) . Injection of control FITC – dextran 4 did not show this pat - tern of localization ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S1c ) . Furthermore , this actin cloud was not present in Lat A - treated oocytes ( Fig . 3f ) . Two - colour 4D movies showed that the actin cloud initially distributed sym - metrically around the chromosome / spindle region , but as chromosomes initiated movement towards the cell periphery , the actin distribution became asymmetric , with actin concentrated towards the back of the chromosomes / spindle ( Fig . 3c , d ; Supplementary Information , Movie 5 ) . When viewed along a plane parallel to the trajectory of the movement , the space between the chromosome mass and actin cloud was expected to be occupied by the spindle structure ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S1a ) . The symmetry - breaking event described above can be repre - sented quantitatively in a plot of the distance between the centre of the chromosomal mass and the centre of the actin cloud mass over time ( Fig . 3h , red line ) . Initially the two centres of mass were close to each other , but a sudden increase in the distance between them correlated with a large chromosome displacement towards the cortex ( Fig . 3 ) . Actin continued to concentrate behind the chromosomes / spindle as they moved towards the cortex ( Fig . 3c , d ; Supplementary Information , Movie 5 ) . In Jas - treated cells , a much denser actin cloud maintained a roughly symmetric distribution around the chromosomes ( Fig . 3e ; Supplementary Information , Movie 6 ) . We used thin - section electron microscopy to observe cytoskel - etal structures in the vicinity of the chromosomes in better detail . Filaments of 7 – 10 nm in width were frequently observed in striated bundles of 0 . 2 – 1 . 5 µm in length and 0 . 08 – 0 . 15 µm in width in the vicin - ity of meiotic chromosomes ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S2a , b ) . On - section labelling immuno - electron microscopy using an anti - actin antibody showed that these structures contained actin ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S2h ) . Consistent with these being actin - associated structures , the filament bundles were sensitive to Lat A treatment ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S2e , g ) . Similar structures were also reported in a previous study , which showed the presence of both actin and keratin in the observed bundles 18 . Fmn2 ( a formin - family protein ) was previously shown to be required for the movement of meiotic chromosomes to the cortex and polar - body extrusion in mouse oocytes 15 , 19 .

Indeed , in oocytes from Fmn2 – / – mice , neither the actin cloud nor the fila - ment bundles surrounding the chromosomes was observed ( Fig . 3g ; Supplementary Information , Fig . S2f , g ) . 4D - tracking experiments further confirmed that Fmn2 – / – oocytes were deficient in chromosome movement ( Fig . 2a , b , d ; Table 1 ) . To test whether Fmn2 can indeed nucleate actin filaments , a recombinant Fmn2 fragment containing the FH1 and FH2 domains ( FH1FH2 ) was produced and tested using the pyrene – actin assembly assay . Actin polymerization was stimulated in a concentration - dependent manner in the presence of FH1FH2 ( Fig . 4a ) ; mutation of residues Ile 1215 , Arg 1295 and Lys 1371 in the FH2 domain ( conserved residues directly contacting actin ) 21 , 22 to Ala ( FH1FH2 IRK ) abolished this activity ( Fig . 4a ) . To test whether the actin nucleation activity of Fmn2 is required for chromosome movement towards the cortex , mRNA encoding full - length Fmn2 , the FH1FH2 fragment or the full - length Fmn2 IRK mutant was injected into Fmn2 – / – oocytes .

These results suggest that the actin nucleation activity of Fmn2 is required for chromosome movement to the cortex . As injection of mRNA encoding GFP – Fmn2 rescued chromosome movement in Fmn2 – / – oocytes ( Fig . 4b ) , we used this construct to observe Fmn2 localization . Before germinal vesicle breakdown , GFP – Fmn2 was diffuse throughout the oocyte ( Fig . 4c ) . After germinal vesicle break - down , GFP – Fmn2 localized , similarly to F - actin , around the meiotic chromosomes in a circular area with a radius of 14 – 17 µm ( Fig . 4d ) . On - section labelling immuno - electron microscopy using an anti - GFP antibody showed the presence of gold particles on or near the chromo - somes ( Supplementary Information , Fig . S3 ) . In oocytes where chromo - somes were on their way to the cortex , GFP – Fmn2 concentrated behind the chromosomes / spindle ( Fig . 4e ) ; however , time - lapse imaging was unsuccessful as the fluorescence signal was low . To identify the region of Fmn2 required for the observed localization , mRNA encoding the GFP - tagged N - terminal 1 – 734 amino acids was injected . This N - terminal fragment was sufficient for localization to the chromosome vicinity and the location was insensitive to Lat A treatment ( Fig . 4f , g ) . In contrast , the remaining C - terminal half ( amino acids 735 – 1578 , containing FH1 and FH2 ) showed only a diffuse distribution in the cytosol ( Fig . 4h ) . a b c d e f g h 0 : 00 1 : 00 2 : 00 3 : 00 4 : 00 0 : 00 1 : 00 2 : 00 3 : 00 4 : 00 0 5 10 15 0 100 200 300 Time ( min ) D i s p l ace m e n t ( µ m ) Figure 3 Visualization of actin in the vicinity of meiotic chromosomes .

All rights reserved . l e t t e r s Taken together , the results described above do not favour the model that chromosomes are moved as cargo along a pre - existing actin track or through an actin / myosin - II - based contractile network . Instead , our observations are consistent with a model in which chromosome movement to the cortex is driven by actin polymerization . An inter - esting property of chromosome movement is the periodicity in speed . A similar pattern of movement was previously observed for the actin polymerization - driven movement of Listeria or VCA - coated beads 13 , 14 . An elastic analysis of these motility systems suggests that such a move - ment pattern may be explained by intrinsic physical parameters , such as the diameter of the beads 14 . Another important property of actin polymerization - driven motility observed with beads is the capacity for spontaneous symmetry breaking from a cloud of actin that initially forms symmetrically around the beads 14 , 23 , 24 . A stochastic model based on Brownian ratchet 25 predicted that a moderate filament depolymeri - zation rate would be critical for the conversion of random motions to directional motions by a polymerizing actin network . This prediction is consistent with our observation that Jas prevented symmetry breaking of the actin cloud and movement of meiotic chromosomes away from the oocyte centre . Examples of actin polymerization - driven motility that have been well studied involve actin nucleation by the Arp2 / 3 complex , which leads to assembly of a dendritic network composed of branched actin filaments 20 . However , in recent studies , filament bundles containing actin and kera - tin were observed in the vicinity of meiotic chromosomes . The formation of these bundles around chromosomes depends on both Fmn2 and actin polymerization , as indicated by latA sensitivity . Thus , one interesting question for future research is how Fmn2 might mediate co - assembly of actin and intermediate filaments to exert force on meiotic chromosomes . In addition , it remains to be determined whether actin directly exerts force on meiotic chromosomes . The observed cloud of F - actin or Fmn2 did not appear to be always in tight association with the chromosomes , and it is therefore possible that an as - yet unidentified structure serves as a scaffold for the actin - based force .

More remarkably , symmetry breaking in this system to achieve an overall displacement is also the origin of symmetry breaking at the cellular level , which enables oocytes to establish cortical polarity and undergo asymmetric meiotic cell divisions . MetHODs Oocyte dissection , preparation and culture . All experiments involving higher vertebrates were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Stowers Institute for Medical Research . Ovaries were collected from 4 – 7 - week - old wild - type FVB , Fmn2 + / + and Fmn2 – / – female mice 44 – 48 h after injecting with pregnant mare serum gonadotropin ( 5 IU ; Sigma ) . Mice were euthanized by CO 2 asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation . Oocytes were released by puncturing the ovaries with needles in M2 medium , which contained 0 . 2 mM 3 - isobutyl - 1 - methylxanthine ( IBMX , Sigma ) to maintain prophase arrest . Time - lapse imaging . Oocytes from FVB mice were cultured in a chamber with appropriate humidity and 5 % CO2 at 37 °C . To visualize DNA , oocytes were cultured in M16 medium ( Specialty Medium ) containing Hoechst bisbenzimide 33258 ( 0 . 5 µg ml – 1 ; Sigma ) . We examined the toxicity of Hoechst ( 1 – 200 µg ml – 1 ) on mouse oocyte maturation . Oocytes stained with 200 µg ml – 1 Hoechst showed a normal rate of polar - body extrusion ( 76 % , n = 60 ) , which is comparable to unstained oocytes ( 70 % , n = 70 ) . The time required for maturation ( 9 . 1 ± 0 . 2 h ) was also similar to that in unstained oocytes ( 8 . 5 ± 0 . 3 h ) . In time - lapse imag - ing , Hoechst was added after GVBD but before chromosome movement to further reduce possible toxicity . In drug - treatment experiments , the medium was supplemented with 200 µg ml – 1 wheat germ agglutinin ( WGA , Sigma ) , 20 µM ML - 7 ( Sigma ) , 10 µM Lat A ( Molecular probes ) , or 1 µM or 10 µM Jas ( Molecular probes ) , 10 µM nocodazole ( Sigma ) and 75 – 100 µM blebbistatin ( + / – ) ( Biomol ) . Imaging was performed with a LSM 510 META ( Carl Zeiss ) with a Plan Apochromat ×20 / 0 . 75 objective . Hoechst was excited at 775 nm using a 2 - photon coherent chameleon laser at low power ( 4 % ) and emission was collected at 435 – 485 nm . To visualize F actin , 10 pl of 1 mg ml – 1 FITC – Lifeact peptide 17 was injected into oocytes and was excited at 488 nm with 10 % argon laser power . Emission was collected at 500 – 550 nm with Plan 40 × 1 . 2 NA C - Apochromat . All 4D images were tracked and anaysed using Imaris ( Bitplane ) . Statistical analysis . Statistical analysis , including determination of Pearson’s coef - ficient , was performed using Excel and OriginPro 7 . 5 software . To determine P values , a heteroscedatic two - tailed test was used . Immunofluorescent staining and electron microscopy .

Fixed oocytes were permeabilized with 4 % BSA and 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 for 10 min and incubated with anti - β - actin ( A5441 , Sigma , diluted 1 : 1000 in blocking buffer ) antibodies for 2 h at room temperature . DNA was stained with DAPI mount - ing medium ( Vector Laboratories ) . After washing six times in blocking buffer , the sample was incubated with secondary FluoNanogold anti - mouse Fab ´ - Alexa Fluor 488 ( Nanoprobes ; 1 : 100 diluted in blocking buffer ) for 2 – 3 h . For pre - embed labelling immuno - electron microscopy 26 , 27 , oocytes were fixed in 4 % paraformeldehyde and 0 . 01 % glutraradehyde , and washed with blocking solution ( PBS containing 1 % normal goat serum , 50 mM glycine , 1 mg ml – 1 BSA , 0 . 02 % sodium azide , and 0 . 01 % saponin ) for 2 × 30 min . The sample was incu - bated with anti - β - actin ( A5441 , Sigma , diluted 1 : 1000 in blocking buffer ) for 24 – 48 h at 4 °C and rinsed four times in blocking buffer ( 15 min each time ) fol - lowed by incubation with secondary FluoNanogold anti - mouse Fab ´ - Alexa Fluor 488 ( Nanoprobes ; 1 : 100 diluted in blocking buffer ) for 2 – 3 h . After washing with blocking buffer , the sample was post - fixed in 1 % glutaraldehyde / PBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) overnight at 4 °C , washed , enhanced with goldenhance - EM ( Nanoprobes ) and visualized using a Tecnai TEM ( FEI ) . For on - section labelling immuno - electron microscopy , oocytes were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde and 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde in PBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) for 4 – 6 h , and washed 3 times in 0 . 1 M PBS for 15 minutes each . The sample was dehydrated by washing three times in a graded series of alcohol ( in PBS ) for 15 min each : 30 % ethanol , 50 % ethanol , 70 % ethanol , 90 % ethanol and 100 % ethanol , and then infiltrated with LR White resin in two 1 h changes and embedded in LR White resin . The section was stained with mouse anti - β - actin ( Sigma ) or anti - GFP ( Rockland ) , and secondary 10 nm gold - conjugated goat anti - mouse antibodies ( Sigma ; 1 : 20 dilution ) . For ultrastructural visualization of actin 28 , oocytes were washed three times ( 2 min each ) in warm HPSS ( + NaHCO3 ) . Samples were fixed with 2 % glutarade - hyde in 0 . 1 M HEPES ( pH 7 . 3 ) , 0 . 05 % saponin and 0 . 2 % tannic acid ( freshly filtered , 0 . 2 µm filter pore ) for 40 min . Fixative was removed by washes in 0 . 1 M HEPES . Samples were post - fixed with 0 . 1 % OsO 4 ( aqueous ) for 10 min , washed in twice in distilled water ( 10 min each ) . Oocytes were dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol to 100 % , infiltrated with resin ( epon 812 ) : ethanol ( 1 : 3 and 1 : 1 , each for 1 h ) , then stored in 3 : 1 resin : ethanol overnight at 4 °C . The resin was polymerized at 37 °C and 60 °C each for 24 h ; ultrathin sections ( approximately 50 – 70 nm ) were cut on a Leica ultramicrotome using diamond knives . Sections were stained with 2 % uranyl acetate and lead citrate for 10 min and 5 min , respectively . Pyrene actin assembly assay and protein purification . Wild - type and mutant ( FH1FH2 IRK ) FH1FH2 fragments were inserted into pET28C vector ( Novagen ) and expressed in BL21 bacteria . The His6 - labelled proteins were purified by Ni - NTA agarose ( Qiagen ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and then dialysed into G - actin buffer containing 5 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 0 . 2 mM DTT and 0 . 2 mM ATP . Pyrene actin assembly assay using 5 µM G - actin containing 10 % pyrene - labelled actin was performed as described previously 29 . mRNA injection . Full - length Fmn2 and mutant Fmn2 IRS were inserted into pCS2 + ( ref . 19 ) . Genes encoding the FH1FH2 fragment , N - terminal ( amino acids 1 – 734 ) or C - terminal ( amino acids 735 – 1578 ) region of Fmn2 – GFP and Fmn2 – GFP were inserted into pBluescript RN3 ( ref . 30 ) . Capped mRNA was synthesized from a linearized template using mMessage mMachine ( Ambion ) , purified with an mEG - Aclear kit ( Ambion ) and dissolved in RNase - free water ( Ambion ) . 1 – 5 % oocyte volume was injected at a constant flow rate with a microinjector ( Eppendorf ) .
