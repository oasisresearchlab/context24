Stephens 1 , 3 & Rajan Sah 1 , 3 , 4 Insulin secretion is initiated by activation of voltage - gated Ca 2 + channels ( VGCC ) to trigger Ca 2 + - mediated insulin vesicle fusion with the β - cell plasma membrane . The ﬁ ring of VGCC requires β - cell membrane depolarization , which is regulated by a balance of depolarizing and hyperpolarizing ionic currents . Here , we show that SWELL1 mediates a swell - activated , depolarizing chloride current ( I Cl , SWELL ) in both murine and human β - cells . Hypotonic and glucose - stimulated β - cell swelling activates SWELL1 - mediated I Cl , SWELL and this contributes to membrane depolarization and activation of VGCC - dependent intracellular calcium sig - naling . SWELL1 depletion in MIN6 cells and islets signi ﬁ cantly impairs glucose - stimulated insulin secretion . Tamoxifen - inducible β - cell - targeted Swell1 KO mice have normal fasting serum glucose and insulin levels but impaired glucose - stimulated insulin secretion and glu - cose tolerance ; and this is further exacerbated in mild obesity . Our results reveal that β - cell SWELL1 modulates insulin secretion and systemic glycaemia by linking glucose - mediated β - cell swelling to membrane depolarization and activation of VGCC - triggered calcium signaling .

Accordingly , therapeutic strategies for the treatment of diabetes aim to improve insulin sensitivity ( thiazolidinediones ) or augment insulin secretion from the pancreatic β - cell ( sulphonylurea receptor inhibitors ) . Insulin secretion from the pancreatic β - cell is triggered by Ca 2 + in ﬂ ux through voltage - gated Ca 2 + channels ( VGCC ) to promote insulin vesicle fusion with the β - cell plasma membrane . The ﬁ ring of VGCC depends on the β - cell membrane potential , which is in turn mediated by the balance of depolarizing ( excitatory ) and hyperpolarizing ( inhibitory ) ionic currents 4 — thus , the β - cell membrane potential is a critical regulator of insulin secretion . Hyperpolarizing , inhibitory potassium currents have been extensively studied , including I KATP 5 , delayed recti ﬁ er K + cur - rents 4 , 6 , and more recently TASK - 1 7 and TALK - 1 8 potassium channels . Indeed , a cornerstone of current diabetes pharma - cotherapy , the sulphonylurea receptor inhibitors ( i . e . , glibenclamide / glyburide ) , is aimed at antagonizing the hyperpo - larizing I K , ATP current to facilitate β - cell depolarization and thereby potentiate insulin secretion . While much attention has focused on these inhibitory hyperpolarizing currents , there is little knowledge about the excitatory currents required to depolarize the β - cell in the ﬁ rst place , including the molecular identity of these currents 4 , with the exception of emerging data demon - strating that transient receptor potential ( TRP ) channels may contribute to β - cell excitability 9 – 12 in mice . There is a longstanding hypothesis , ﬁ rst proposed in the 1990s , that an elusive chloride ( Cl − ) conductance known as the volume regulatory anion current ( VRAC ) or swell - activated Cl − current ( I Cl , SWELL ) is responsible for an important glucose sensitive , swell - activated depolarizing current that is required for β - cell depo - larization and subsequent activation of VGCC - mediated Ca 2 + signaling , insulin vesicle fusion and insulin secretion 13 – 20 . These studies and others propose that β - cell depolarization requires not only the release of a “ brake , ” mediated by I KATP , but also acti - vation of an undiscovered swell - activated “ accelerator ” to drive the β - cell membrane potential to the threshold potential for VGCC activation required for insulin secretion . In the current study , we combine β - cell patch clamp with shRNA - and CRISPR / cas9 - mediated gene silencing , to show for the ﬁ rst time that the gene Lrrc8a , a member of the leucine - rich repeat ( LRR ) containing proteins 21 , 22 ( Swell1 ) is required for this prominent swell - activated chloride current in MIN6 β - cells , and in mouse and human primary β - cells . SWELL1 forms a hetero - multimeric channel with LRRC8b - e 21 – 23 and is responsible for VRAC and I Cl , SWELL in cell lines . SWELL1 and associated LRRC8b - e are broadly expressed 21 , 24 , and although principally thought of as volume regulatory ion channels , the physiological function of SWELL1 – LRRC8 channels remain unknown . We show that SWELL1 is required for normal swell and glucose - stimulated β - cell membrane depolarization , Ca 2 + signaling , insulin secretion , and systemic glucose homeostasis in response to a glucose load . These data highlight SWELL1 - mediated “ swell - secretion ” coupling as required for glucose - stimulated insulin secretion ( GSIS ) and for regulation of systemic glycaemia . Results SWELL1 mediates swell - activated I Cl , SWELL in β - cells . Recent studies have identi ﬁ ed SWELL1 as a required component of a swell - activated Cl − current I Cl , SWELL or VRAC in common cell lines 21 , 22 , forming multimeric channels with LRRC8b - e 23 . To determine if SWELL1 is also required for I Cl , SWELL in pancreatic β - cells , we adenovirally transduced mouse insulinoma ( MIN6 ) cells with either an shRNA - directed against Swell1 ( Ad - U6 - shswell1 - mCherry ; Fig . 1a ) or a scrambled shRNA control ( Ad - U6 - shSCR - mCherry ) . We observe robust knockdown of SWELL1 protein ( Fig . 1b and Supplementary Fig . 6a ) and a signi ﬁ cant reduction in hypotonic swell - activated I Cl , SWELL in Ad - sh Swell1 relative to Ad - shSCR - transduced MIN6 cells ( Fig . 1c , d ) . To determine whether SWELL1 is also required for I Cl , SWELL in mouse primary β - cells , we isolated islets from Swell1 ﬂ oxed mice ( Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ ) 25 and transduced them with an adenovirus - expressing GFP under control of a rat insulin promoter ( Ad - RIP2 - GFP ) to allow positive identi ﬁ cation of β - cells ( GFP + cells ) . Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ islets were further treated with either an adenovirus - expressing Cre - mCherry to induce Cre - mediated excision of the ﬂ oxed Swell1 allele or a control virus expressing mCherry alone ( Supplemen - tary Fig . 1a ) . By selecting GFP + / mCherry + cells , we patch clamped either control WT β - cells ( Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ β - cells ) or Swell1 KO β - cells ( Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ / Cre β - cells ; Fig . 1e ) . We ﬁ nd that WT β - cells express substantial swell - activated current that is entirely abolished upon Cre - mediated recombination in Swell1 KO β - cells ( Fig . 1f – h ) . We next tested whether SWELL1 is also required for I Cl , SWELL in human β - cells and applied a similar approach . We transduced human islets with Ad - RIP2 - GFP and Ad - sh Swell1 - mCherry or Ad - sh - SCR - mCherry ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) , in order to isolate and patch clamp human β - cells ( GFP + ) subjected to shRNA - mediated SWELL1 KD or to a scrambled control ( GFP + / mCherry + ; Fig . 1i ) . Similar to mouse β - cell recordings , we ﬁ nd that human β - cells also express signi ﬁ cant SWELL1 - mediated swell - activated current ( Fig . 1j – l ) . Indeed , in all β - cells patch clamped , the reversal potential is ~ − 12 mV , which is near the reversal potential for Cl − under our recording conditions , con - sistent with SWELL1 mediating a swell - activated Cl − conductance in β - cells , as reported previously 13 , 16 , 17 . These data demonstrate that SWELL1 is required for VRAC or I Cl , SWELL in pancreatic β - cells . Extracellular glucose activates SWELL1 - mediated I Cl , SWELL in β - cells . Having established that SWELL1 is required for this previously enigmatic depolarizing swell - activated Cl − current 16 , 17 in MIN6 cells , and in both mouse and human primary β - cells , we asked whether glucose - mediated β - cell swelling 19 is suf ﬁ cient to activate SWELL1 - mediated I Cl , SWELL . First , we measured β - cell size by light microscopy in WT and Swell1 KO / KD primary murine and human β - cells , respectively , in response to glucose - stimulated swelling ( at 35 – 37 °C ) . WT murine β - cells swell 6 . 8 ± 1 . 6 % in cross - sectional area upon perfusion of 16 . 7 mM glucose ( from 1 mM basal glucose ) and reach a maximum size at 12 min post glucose stimulation , followed by a reduction in β - cell size ( Fig . 2a ) , consistent with regulatory volume decrease ( RVD ) . In contrast , Swell1 KO murine β - cells swell monotonically to 8 . 2 ± 2 . 4 % and exhibit no RVD ( Fig . 2a ) . WT human β - cells show a similar trend , swelling 8 . 6 ± 3 . 5 % , followed by RVD , whereas Swell1 KD human β - cells swell monotonically to 6 . 0 ± 1 . 5 % ( Supplementary Fig . 2a ) , and similar to Swell1 KO murine β - cells ( Fig . 2a ) , fail to exhibit RVD . These data indicate that increases in glucose induce β - cell swelling and that SWELL1 is required for RVD in primary β - cells , as observed in cell lines 21 , 22 , 26 . Next , we applied the perforated patch clamp technique to primary β - cells at 35 – 37 °C in order to measure currents under the same con - ditions that induce glucose - mediated β - cell swelling . We ﬁ nd that increases in glucose ( 16 . 7 mM ) activate an outwardly rectifying current in both mouse ( Fig . 2b , d ) and human ( Supplementary Fig . 2b , c ) β - cells . This outwardly rectifying glucose - activated β - cell current is blocked by the selective VRAC or I Cl , SWELL inhi - bitor , DCPIB ( Fig . 2d and Supplementary Fig . 2b , c ) , and is absent in Swell1 KO murine β - cells ( Fig . 2c , e , f ) . Importantly , the activation time - course of the glucose - stimulated SWELL1 - ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 017 - 02664 - 0 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2018 ) 9 : 367 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 017 - 02664 - 0 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications mediated current either tracks or lags the latency of β - cell swel - ling in response to stimulatory glucose , consistent with a mechanism of glucose - mediated β - cell swell activation . Thus , SWELL1 mediates a glucose sensitive swell - activated Cl − current in β - cells . SWELL1 depletion reduces β - cell membrane depolarization . To determine whether the inward Cl − current carried by SWELL1 – LRRC8 channels is suf ﬁ cient to depolarize the β - cell , we next measured β - cell membrane potential ( MP ) in murine and human WT and SWELL1 - de ﬁ cient β - cells upon hypotonic β - cell swelling ( 210 mOsm / kg ) in current - clamp mode using whole - cell con ﬁ guration ( 0 mM ATP i ; Fig . 3a – f ) . Under these conditions , K ATP channels will remain open while SWELL1 - mediated I Cl , SWELL is selectively activated by hypotonic swelling . We ﬁ nd that β - cell resting MP is similar between WT and Swell1 KO / KD β - cells ( Fig . 3b , e ) under basal conditions ; however , the β - cell membrane depolarization rate ( Fig . 3c , f ) is signi ﬁ cantly reduced 1 . 9 - fold in Swell1 KO murine β - cells and 2 . 5 - fold in SWELL1 - de ﬁ cient human β - cells upon hypotonic swelling . These data con ﬁ rm that hypotonic swell - activated SWELL1 - mediated I Cl , SWELL contributes to β - cell membrane depolarization . To determine the contributions of SWELL1 - mediated I Cl , SWELL to glucose stimulation in β - cells , we next measured β - cell MP in response to 16 . 7 mM glucose in WT and Swell1 KO murine β - cells at 37 °C in perforated patch con ﬁ guration ( Fig . 3g ) , similar to recording conditions used to measure glucose - stimulated SWELL1 currents shown in Fig . 2 . WT and Swell1 KO β - cells have comparable resting MP ( Fig . 3h ) while glucose - stimulated β - cell membrane depolarization rate is signi ﬁ cantly reduced 2 . 6 - fold in Swell1 KO β - cells ( Fig . 3i ) . Collectively , these data show that SWELL1 - mediated I Cl , SWELL contributes a signi ﬁ cant glucose - stimulated depolarizing current in β - cells . β - cell SWELL1 is required for glucose and swelling - induced Ca 2 + signaling . Having established that SWELL1 - mediated I Cl , SWELL contributes signi ﬁ cantly to both glucose and hypotonic swell - activated β - cell membrane depolarization , we next sought to examine intracellular Ca 2 + signaling in WT and SWELL1 - de ﬁ cient MIN6 β - cells , primary mouse and primary human β - cells in response to these stimuli . Using CRISPR / Cas9 technology , we generated multiple Swell1 KO MIN6 cell lines ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) , con ﬁ rming Swell1 gene disruption by PCR ( Supplemen - tary Fig . 3 ) , SWELL1 protein deletion ( Fig . 4a and Supplementary Fig . 6b ) and ablation of SWELL1 - mediated current ( Fig . 4b ) in these cells . We ﬁ nd that glucose - stimulated Ca 2 + transients are entirely abolished in Swell1 KO MIN6 compared to WT cells ( Fig . 4c – d , f ) , despite preserved KCl ( 40 mM ) stimulated Ca 2 + – 100 100 50 100 150 C u rr en t den s i t y ( p A / p F ) Voltage ( mV ) Hypo Iso 10 12 14 – 50 – 50 – 50 50 0 50 100 150 200 Time ( min ) C u rr en t den s i t y ( p A / p F ) Hypo WT SWELL1 KO 4 6 8 – 100 100 50 100 150 200 WT SWELL1 KO C u rr en t den s i t y ( p A / p F ) Voltage ( mV ) – 30 0 30 60 90 120 * * * C u rr en t den s i t y ( p A / p F ) * * C on t r o l β - c e ll s S W E LL1 K O β - c e ll s 0 30 60 90 S W E LL1 K D β - c e ll s * * * * * – 20 0 20 40 60 80 Time ( min ) Scramble SWELL1 KD Hypo C u rr en t den s i t y ( p A / p F ) 5 10 15 20 – 100 100 20 40 60 C u rr en t den s i t y ( p A / p F ) C u rr en t den s i t y ( p A / p F ) Voltage ( mV ) Scramble SWELL1 KD – 50 0 50 100 150 C on t r o l β - c e ll s S W E LL1 K D β - c e ll s * * * C u rr en t den s i t y ( p A / p F ) h – 100 100 – 50 – 50 – 50 50 – 50 50 50 100 150 C u rr en t den s i t y ( p A / p F ) Voltage ( mV ) Hypo Iso g f e Brightfield Brightfield Ad - Cre - mCherry Ad - sh SWELL1mCherry Ad - RIP - GFP Ad - RIP - GFP Dispersed SWELL1fl murine primary β - cells Dispersed SWELL1fl human primary β - cells Scale bar : 20 μ m GFP + / mCherry + GFP + / mCherry + i j Murine primary β - cells Human primary β - cells Human primary β - cells k l Murine primary β - cells d c β - actin Scale bar : 10 μ m SWELL1 sh - SWELL1 - mCherry b 50 kDa 37 kDa a sh - SCR - mcherry Ad - sh - SWELL1 - mCherry 100 kDa P r o t e i n m a r k e r s s h - S CR - m c he rr y s h - S W E LL1 - m C he rr y – 20 – 50 50 – 30 C on t r o l β - c e ll s Fig . 1 SWELL1 mediates I Cl , SWELL in MIN6 cells and primary mouse and human pancreatic β - cells . a mCherry ﬂ uorescence of the mouse insulinoma cell line ( MIN6 ) transduced with an adenovirus expressing a short hairpin RNA directed to Swell1 ( sh Swell1 - mCherry ) . b SWELL1 western blot in MIN6 cells transduced with sh Swell1 compared to scrambled short hairpin RNA ( shSCR ) . β - actin was used as loading control ( Supplementary Fig . 6a for full blots ) . c Current – voltage relationship of I Cl , SWELL in MIN6 cells at baseline ( red ) and after hypotonic swelling ( Hypo , 210 mOsm / kg , black ) after adenoviral transduction with shSCR ( left ) and sh Swell1 ( right ) . d Mean current inward and outward densities at + 100 and − 100 mV ( n shSCR = 3 cells ; n shswell1 = 4 cells ) . e Bright ﬁ eld , GFP , mCherry , and merged images of freshly dispersed primary β - cells from Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ mouse islets co - transduced with Ad - RIP2 - GFP and Ad - CMV - Cre - mCherry .

Co - application of a selective VGCC blocker nifedipine ( 10 µ M ) fully inhibits these glucose - stimulated Ca 2 + transients in WT MIN6 cells , consistent with a mechanism of membrane depolarization and VGCC activation ( Fig . 4e , f ) . As β - cells are also known to depolarize , ﬁ re Ca 2 + transients , and secrete insulin via a glucose - independent hypotonic swelling mechanism 16 , 20 , we next examined swell - induced Ca 2 + signaling in β - cells in response to hypotonic stimulation ( 220 mOsm / kg ) in the absence of glucose stimulation ( 0 mM glucose ) . These conditions are anticipated to selectively activate SWELL1 - mediated I Cl , SWELL ( Fig . 4b ) while leaving K ATP channels open , thereby dissociating the contributions of SWELL1 - mediated I Cl , SWELL activation from K ATP closure . We ﬁ nd that hypotonic swelling alone can trigger robust Ca 2 + transients in WT MIN6 cells ( Fig . 4g , j ) and these elevations in cytosolic Ca 2 + recover rapidly upon restoration of isotonic solution ( Fig . 4g ) . In contrast , Swell1 KO MIN6 cells do not exhibit hypotonic swelling - induced Ca 2 + transients ( Fig . 4h , j ) , despite preserved KCl - stimulated Ca 2 + responses , consistent with SWELL1 mediating a swell - activated depolarizing current in β - cells ( Figs . 3a – f and 4b ) . As with glucose - stimulated Ca 2 + signaling , we also ﬁ nd that hypotonic swelling triggered Ca 2 + transients are fully inhibited by VGCC blockade ( Fig . 4i , j ) , implicating β - cell membrane depolarization followed by VGCC activation , as opposed to alternative hypo - osmotically activated Ca 2 + in ﬂ ux pathways , such as TRP channels 27 . To measure SWELL1 - dependent Ca 2 + signaling in primary mouse and human β - cells , we generated adenoviruses expressing the genetically encoded Ca 2 + - sensor GCaMP6s under control of the rat insulin promoter 1 ( RIP1 ) , either alone ( Ad - RIP1 - GCaMP6s ) , or in combination with Cre - recombinase ( Ad - RIP1 - Cre - P2A - GCaMP6s ) . This approach provides a robust β - cell - restricted ﬂ uorescent Ca 2 + sensor while simultaneously allowing for β - cell - targeted Cre - mediated Swell1 deletion in cultured islets isolated from Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice ( Fig . 5a ) . GCaMP6s Ca 2 + imaging reveals robust glucose - stimulated Ca 2 + transients in freshly dissociated WT primary murine β - cells ( Ad - RIP1 - GCaMP6s / Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ ; Fig . 5b , d ) and these are signi ﬁ cantly suppressed in Swell1 KO β - cells ( Ad - RIP1 - Cre - P2A - GCaMP6s / Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ ; Fig . 5c , d ) , despite preserved KCl - stimulated Ca 2 + responses . We used a similar approach in human islets , whereby we co - transduced islets with Ad - RIP1 - GCaMP6s ( Fig . 5e ) and either Ad - U6 - sh Swell1 - mCherry or Ad - U6 - shSCR - mCherry . Upon islet dissociation , we imaged only double - labeled GCaMP6s + / mCherry + primary human β - cells . As with mouse primary β - cells , we observe robust glucose - stimulated Ca 2 + transients in Ad - shSCR - treated human primary β - cells ( Fig . 5f , h ) and this is markedly abograted upon Ad - sh Swell1 - mediated SWELL1 knockdown ( Fig . 5g , h ) . Collectively , these data demonstrate that SWELL1 mediates a glucose and hypotonic swell - sensitive depolarizing I Cl , SWELL current that is necessary for normal β - cell depolarization and consequent intracellular Ca 2 + signaling . The balance of I Cl , SWELL and I KATP regulates β - cell Ca 2 + sig - naling . Physiological increases in extracellular glucose and sub - sequent glucose metabolism induces both β - cell swelling 15 ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Fig . 2a ) and increases β - cell cyto - plasmic ATP / ADP ratio 2 . Therefore , glucose metabolism is pre - dicted to concurrently activate depolarizing SWELL1 - mediated I Cl , SWELL and deactivate hyperpolarizing I KATP — suggesting that SWELL1 and K ATP coordinately regulate β - cell membrane depolarization . Indeed , application of 3 - O - methyl - glucose , a non - metabolizable form of glucose , is ineffective at stimulating β - cell Ca 2 + transients ( Fig . 6a ) 19 , however , it is also incapable of inducing β - cell swelling 19 and K ATP closure , as both require glucose metabolism 19 . To parse the relative contributions of depolarizing SWELL1 - mediated I Cl , SWELL and hyperpolarizing I KATP to β - cell excitability , we measured intracellular Ca 2 + in WT and Swell1 KO β - cells in response to selective modulators of either K ATP or [ Cl − ] i , the latter indirectly regulating I Cl , SWELL . In pancreatic β - cells , [ Cl − ] i is maintained relatively elevated ( 34 – 36 mM ) 28 , 29 by Na + / K + / Cl − ( NKCC1 ) cotransporters 30 , 31 .

NKCC1 inhibition by bumetanide 33 , 34 reduces [ Cl − ] i , which drops E Cl − closer to − 70 mV , thereby diminishing or abolishing the glucose - stimulated depolarizing current carried by I Cl , SWELL . Indeed , we ﬁ nd that bumetanide ( 10 µ M ) fully inhibits glucose - stimulated ( 16 . 7 mM ) Ca 2 + signaling in both WT MIN6 cells ( Fig . 6b , c ) and WT primary murine β - cells ( Fig . 6d , e ) , to an extent comparable to Swell1 KO β - cells ( Fig . 5c , d ) . These data suggest that elevated [ Cl − ] i maintained by β - cell NKCC1 activity is necessary for β - cell depolarization via a SWELL1 - mediated glucose - stimulated depolarizing Cl − current . To examine the contribution of I KATP to β - cell depolarization in WT and Swell1 KO β - cells , we measured basal and glucose - stimulated intracellular Ca 2 + in response to the K ATP opener , diazoxide , and K ATP inhibitor , glibenclamide . K ATP activation ( 100 µ M diazoxide ) fully suppresses glucose - stimulated intracel - lular Ca 2 + in murine β - cells ( Fig . 6f , g ) , without blocking I Cl , SWELL ( Supplementary Fig . 4a , b ) , indicating that K ATP closure is necessary for glucose - stimulated β - cell excitation . Moreover , application of low - dose glibenclamide ( 0 . 25 nM ) , which is predicted to block ~ 25 – 30 % of K ATP channels 35 ( without activating I Cl , SWELL , Supplementary Fig . 4c , d ) is suf ﬁ cient to stimulate WT but not Swell1 KO β - cells ( Fig . 6h – j ) . These data suggests that , under basal conditions , there is a background of constitutively active SWELL1 - mediated depolarizing I Cl , SWELL that is balanced by hyperpolarizing I KATP to maintain resting β - cell membrane potential . Indeed , basal I Cl , SWELL has been reported in neurons 36 , 37 and , importantly , has been measured in β - cells ( NP = ~ 0 . 06 , at 1 mM glucose ) 38 . Near full I KATP inhibition with higher dose glibenclamide ( 10 nM , 0 mM glucose ) 35 is capable of activating intracellular Ca 2 + in both WT and Swell1 KO β - cells ( Fig . 6k – m ) , just as robust I Cl , SWELL activation with hypotonic swelling ( at 0 mM glucose ) can overcome I KATP and trigger Ca 2 + transients ( Fig . 4g ) and insulin release from β - cells 16 . Taken together , these data support a model whereby SWELL1 - mediated I Cl , SWELL and I KATP counterbalance each other to regulate glucose - stimulated β - cell Ca 2 + signaling . SWELL1 depletion selectively impairs glucose - mediated insulin secretion . To determine the impact of SWELL1 - dependent glu - cose - stimulated Ca 2 + signaling on insulin secretion in β - cells , we measured glucose - stimulated insulin secretion ( GSIS ) in WT and Swell1 KO MIN6 cells . We ﬁ nd that the glucose - dependent ( 1 , 5 . 5 , and 30 mM ) increase in insulin secretion in WT MIN6 cells is signi ﬁ cantly diminished in Swell1 KO MIN6 cells ( Fig . 7a ) , par - ticularly at higher glucose concentration ( 30 mM ) , despite no change in total insulin content ( Fig . 7b ) .

Similar to MIN6 cells , we note a signi ﬁ cant reduction in GSIS ( 16 . 7 mM glucose ) in Swell1 KO compared to WT islets ( Fig . 7d ) , despite relatively preserved L - arginine - stimulated insulin secre - tion ( Fig . 7d ) , and similar total insulin content ( Fig . 7e ) . Com - parable to murine islets , SWELL1 KD human islets also exhibit a selective impairment in GSIS ( Fig . 7f , g ) . Swell1 deletion impairs insulin release and systemic glycaemia in vivo . We next generated tamoxifen ( Tm ) - inducible β - cell - targeted Swell1 KO mice by crossing Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice with Ins1 CreERT2 mice ( Ins1 CreERT2 ; Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ , Fig . 8a ) 39 , 40 to examine the requirement of β - cell SWELL1 for insulin secretion and regulation of systemic glycaemia in vivo . Ins1 CreERT2 mice have been previously characterized and validated to be indistinguish - able from WT mice with respect to body weight and glucose homeostasis , while providing ef ﬁ cient , Tm - inducible , β - cell selective recombination 40 . Indeed , islets isolated from Ins1 CreERT2 ; Rosa26 - tdTomato ; Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice reveal ef ﬁ cient β - cell - targeted recombination after Tm - administration ( 40 – 80 mg / kg / day gavage × 5 days ; Supplementary Fig . 5 ) , similar to prior studies 40 . Moreover , we observe no evidence of β - cell loss upon Swell1 deletion based on the number of tdTomato - positive β - cells present in the islet . We observe pancreas - restricted Swell1 recombination in Tm - induced Ins1 CreERT2 ; Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice ( + ) by PCR across Swell1 Exon 3 ( 426 bp amplicon ; Fig . 8b ) ; and this recombination is not observed in vehicle - treated Ins1 CreERT2 ; Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice ( − ) . Finally , we observe complete ablation of SWELL1 - mediated I Cl , SWELL in 80 % of β - cells isolated from Tm - induced Ins1 CreERT2 ; Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ ( 8 / 10 cells ; Fig . 8c – d ) , while 100 % of β - cells from vehicle - induced Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ ( WT ) exhibit robust hypotonically activated SWELL1 - mediated currents ( 4 / 4 cells ) . We next measured glucose tolerance in Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ and Ins1 CreERT2 ; Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ before and after Tm - induced β - cell selective Swell1 deletion . Pre - Tm - induction , Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ ( − ) and Ins1 CreERT2 ; Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ ( − ) mice have identical fasting glucose levels ( 6 h fast ) and glucose tolerance in response to a glucose load ( Fig . 8e ) . However , post - Tm - treatment , Ins1 CreERT2 ; Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ ( + ) mice exhibit signi ﬁ cantly impaired glucose tolerance compared to Tm - induced Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ ( + ) mice , predominantly soon after the glucose load ( Fig . 8f ) . In a separate cohort of mice , we measured serum insulin in Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ and Ins1 CreERT2 ; Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice after Tm - induction ( + ) . We ﬁ nd that basal ( fasting ) serum insulin values are similar between genotypes ( Fig . 8g ) , however , with glucose stimulation insulin secretion is signi ﬁ cantly impaired in Tm - induced Ins1 CreERT2 ; Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ ( + ) mice compared to Tm - induced Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice ( + ) ( Fig . 8g , h ) , and this is also associated with impaired glucose tolerance ( Fig . 8i ) . When these mice are placed on a high - fat diet ( HFD ; 60 % fat ) for 5 – 6 weeks to induce mild obesity , and a state of pre - diabetes , we ﬁ nd that Tm - induced Ins1 CreERT2 ; Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ ( + ) mice exhibit elevated fasting serum glucose ( Fig . 8j ) and exacerbated glucose intolerance ( Fig . 8k ) as – 100 – 50 50 100 – 1000 1000 2000 3000 WT Hypo WT baseline SWELL1 KO baseline SWELL1 KO Hypo C u rr en t ( p A ) Voltage ( mV ) h g 30 35 40 40 mMKCI 30 mM glucose + nif WT MIN6 WT MIN6 f e SWELL1 KO MIN6 100 kDa 75 kDa 50 kDa 37 kDa SWELL1 KO MIN6 d WT MIN6 WT MIN6 c a SWELL1 β - actin W T 1 W T 2 K O 1 K O 2 b Hypo 40 mM KCl * * * * * * SWELL1KO WT ns ns WT Hypo + nif * * * 1 mM glucose 30 mM glucose 40 mM KCl * * * SWELL1KO WT * ns WT 30 mM glucose + nif 0 10 15 20 Time ( min ) 40 mMKCl 10 15 20 25 30 Time ( min ) 0 10 15 20 25 30 35 Time ( min ) Hypo 40 mMKCl Hypo 40 mMKCl 30 mM glucose 40 mMKCl 0 10 15 20 25 Time ( min ) 30 mM glucose 40 mMKCI i j 340 / 380 r a t i o 2 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 . 0 340 / 380 r a t i o 340 / 380 r a t i o 2 . 0 2 . 0 3 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 . 0 340 / 380 r a t i o 2 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 . 0 0 . 0 5 0 10 15 20 25 Time ( min ) 340 / 380 r a t i o 2 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 . 0 5 0 10 15 20 25 Time ( min ) 340 / 380 r a t i o 1 . 5 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 . 0 340 / 380 r a t i o 1 . 5 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 . 0 5 5 0 5 5 Hypo + nif 340 / 380 r a t i o 1 . 8 1 . 2 0 . 6 0 . 0 Iso Fig . 4 SWELL1 - mediated I Cl , SWELL is required for both glucose - and hypotonic swelling - induced Ca 2 + signaling in MIN6 cells . a SWELL1 western blot in WT and CRISPR / Cas9 - mediated Swell1 KO MIN6 cell lines ( Supplementary Fig . 6b for full blots ) . b Current – voltage plots of SWELL1 - mediated current in response to hypotonic swelling in WT and Swell1 KO MIN6 cells con ﬁ rm complete ablation of hypotonic swelling - stimulated I Cl , SWELL in Swell1 KO MIN6 cells . c – e Fura - 2 Ca 2 + transients in c WT , d Swell1 KO and e WT + nifedipine ( 10 µ M ) MIN6 cells in response to 30 mM glucose stimulation ( basal 1 mM glucose ) . 40 mM KCl stimulation con ﬁ rms cell viability and excitability . f Mean peak Fura - 2 ratio in glucose - stimulated WT ( n = 34 ) , Swell1 KO ( n = 36 ) , and WT + nifedipine ( n = 16 ) MIN6 cells . g – i Fura - 2 Ca 2 + transients in g WT , h Swell1 KO , and i WT + nifedipine ( 10 µ M ) MIN6 cells in response to hypotonic swelling stimulation ( 210 mOsm / kg ; isotonic 300 mOsm / kg ) . j Mean peak Fura - 2 ratio in swell - stimulated WT ( n = 42 cells ) , Swell1 KO ( n = 26 cells ) , and WT + nifedipine MIN6 cells .

Collectively , these data reveal that SWELL1 is post developmentally required for intact glucose - stimulated β - cell membrane depolarization , Ca 2 + - dependent insulin secretion and regulation of systemic glycaemia , particularly in the setting of mild obesity . Discussion Ion channel regulation of β - cell excitability is critical for med - iating β - cell Ca 2 + signaling , insulin secretion , and systemic gly - caemia 2 , 41 . Therefore , identifying novel ion channels that control β - cell excitability will advance our understanding of β - cell phy - siology , and potentially open previously unexplored therapeutic avenues for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) . VRAC or I Cl , SWELL is a swell - activated ionic current that has been studied for decades through electrophysiological recordings in numerous cell types 42 – 44 , but only recently has it been discovered that SWELL1 / LRRC8a , and associated LRRC8 isoforms b – e , form the I Cl , SWELL channel complex in common cell lines 21 – 23 . Accordingly , the physiological role of SWELL1 - mediated I Cl , SWELL in primary cells remains largely unexplored . In the current study , we asked whether SWELL1 is required for VRAC / I Cl , SWELL described pre - viously in the pancreatic β - cell 16 , 17 , 19 and whether the SWELL1 channel complex mediates a glucose - and swell - sensitive depo - larizing current in β - cells , as initially proposed by Best et al . 14 Our data are consistent with a model in which SWELL1 is a required component of a swell - activated depolarizing Cl − channel that is present in MIN6 cells , in primary murine β - cells and , impor - tantly , in primary human β - cells . SWELL1 - mediated I Cl , SWELL activates in response to glucose - stimulated β - cell swelling and is required for normal membrane depolarization , VGCC activation , Ca 2 + - mediated insulin vesicle fusion , and insulin secretion ( Fig . 9 ) . In this model , the hyperpolarizing K + conductances 5 – 8 , 45 , 46 act as “ brakes ” on β - cell excitability and insulin secretion , while SWELL1 - mediated I Cl , SWELL is the “ accelerator ”— promoting β - cell excitability in response to glucose - mediated β - cell swelling . We propose that it is the bal - ance between I Cl , SWELL and I KATP that is critical in regulating β - cell membrane potential , as either robust I Cl , SWELL activation , or full I KATP inhibition , are alone capable of depolarizing the β - cell . However , partial I KATP inhibition ( ~ 30 % K ( ATP ) blockade ; 0 . 25 nM glibenclamide ) 35 is incapable of stimulating β - cells in the absence of SWELL1 - mediated I Cl , SWELL . Our data are consistent with previous reports that postulate the existence of glucose sensitive anionic current ( s ) , in addition to I KATP that contribute to glucose - stimulated β - cell depolarization 13 , 14 , 20 , 47 – 49 ; especially since glucose - dependent I KATP inhibition occurs primarily at substimulatory glucose concentrations ( 0 – 5 mM ) and is saturated in the stimulatory range between 5 – 20 mM glucose 48 . Thus , in our current model , SWELL1 - mediated I Cl , SWELL and I KATP are both glucose sensitive ionic currents that antithetically regulate β - cell membrane potential . The activation mechanism of SWELL1 - mediated I Cl , SWELL is unique among other known ion channels expressed in the β - cell in that it is mediated by β - cell swelling 13 , 16 , 20 , that under phy - siological conditions , is glucose stimulated 14 , 19 , and dependent on glucose metabolism 19 . The mechanism of glucose - stimulated β - cell swelling is thought to occur via glucose break down into lactate 14 , 15 or other small metabolites , which increase intracel - lular osmotic pressure and draws in water 50 , potentially via aquaporin 7 channels 51 , 52 . In this way , SWELL1 - mediated I Cl , SWELL senses extracellular glucose indirectly , and is intrinsi - cally coupled to glucose metabolism ; just as I KATP is linked to glucose metabolism via glucose - dependent changes in ATP / ADP ratio .

Notably , SWELL1 - de ﬁ cient β - cells exhibit preserved glucose - stimulated swelling , suggesting that glucose metabolism is intact in these cells 15 , 19 . Hence , it is unlikely that impaired β - cell excitability in SWELL1 - de ﬁ cient β - cells arises from defective glucose metabolism . Indeed , β - cell - targeted disruption of glucose metabolism through β - cell selective deletion of glucokinase induces a very severe diabetic phenotype with early neonatal lethality 54 , in contrast to milder , glucose intolerance observed with tamoxifen - induced β - cell - targeted Swell1 deletion . The biophysical properties of the SWELL1 channel complex mediating I Cl , SWELL is intriguing with respect to β - cell electro - physiology and regulation of excitation – secretion coupling . The property of outward recti ﬁ cation provides greater β - cell mem - brane depolarization at hyperpolarized potentials ( i . e . , larger inward currents ) to initiate β - cell excitation , but then electro - chemically “ shuts - off ” at more depolarized potentials as the membrane potential approaches the equilibrium potential of Cl − ( E Cl − ~ − 15 mV 29 , 32 ) . As the membrane potential exceeds E Cl − , SWELL1 - mediated I Cl , SWELL provides a hyperpolarizing current to stabilize the β - cell around E Cl − , thereby maximizing Ca 2 + in ﬂ ux via voltage - gated Ca 2 + channels , as hypothesized by Eberhardson et al . 28 , and also allows for β - cell repolarization , and termination of insulin secretion upon subsequent activation of delayed - recti ﬁ er potassium channels 6 . Interestingly , the RVD mediated by I Cl , SWELL / VRAC activation promotes β - cell con - traction ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Fig . 2a ) 19 , thereby removing the swell stimulus for I Cl , SWELL activation . This results in SWELL1 channel complex closure upon return to basal glucose , which also permits β - cell repolarization . In addition to SWELL1 - mediated I Cl , SWELL , there are certainly other depolarizing currents that contribute to β - cell excitability , since full suppression of I KATP is capable of stimulating Swell1 KO β - cells . These include TRP channels , including TRPM3 12 , TRPM4 55 , and TRPM5 9 – 11 ; though not all of these TRP channels are necessarily expressed in human β - cells 56 . Cystic ﬁ brosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) has been impli - cated as a Cl − conductance important for glucose - stimulated β - cell excitability and secretion 57 as has ANO1 / TMEM16A 58 ; however , the presence of CFTR in the β - cell is controversial 59 . Finally , ClC - 3 , a chloride channel localized to insulin granules , has been proposed to regulate insulin processing and secretion via acidi ﬁ cation mechanisms 60 . Given the signi ﬁ cant impact of SWELL1 on β - cell excitability , insulin secretion and systemic glycaemia , it is possible that SWELL1 may have other , as yet unrealized , ion channel regulatory functions in β - cell biology . i j k l m a c d e f g h b 10 15 20 Time ( min ) 16 . 7 mM 3 - O - methyl - glucose KCl 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 1 2 3 4 Time ( min ) 0 . 25 nM glib KCl 0 5 0 5 10 15 20 0 2 4 6 8 Time ( min ) Diazoxide 16 . 7 mM glucose 0 5 0 2 4 6 ns * * * 1 mM glucose 16 . 7 mM glucose + diaz 40 mM KCl WT SWELL1 KO WT 10 15 20 25 30 0 1 2 3 4 Time ( min ) 0 . 25 nM glib 10 15 20 25 30 0 1 2 3 4 10 nM glib KCl Time ( min ) 10 15 20 25 10 nM glib KCl Time ( min ) 0 5 0 5 WT SWELL1 KO 0 10 15 20 25 30 35 Time ( min ) Bumetanide 30 mM glucose 1 mM glucose 30 mM glucose 40 mM KCl ns R e l a t i v e i n t en s i t y WT SWELL1 KO 1 mM glucose 1 mM glucose + glib 40 mM KCl 0 1 2 3 4 5 1 mM glucose 1 mM glucose + glib 40 mM KCl R e l a t i v e i n t en s i t y WT SWELL1 KO * * * * ns * * * 0 1 2 3 4 1 mM glucose 16 . 7 mM glucose 40 mM K C l R e l a t i v e i n t en s i t y ns 0 10 15 20 25 30 0 1 2 3 Bumetanide KCl Time ( min ) 16 . 7 mM glucose 0 1 2 3 4 * * R e l a t i v e i n t en s i t y F / F 0 F / F 0 F / F 0 F / F 0 F / F 0 F / F 0 1 . 6 1 . 4 1 . 2 1 . 0 0 . 8 340 / 380 r a t i o 2 . 5 2 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 . 0 5 KCl 1 . 5 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 340 / 380 r a t i o 5 KCl KCl 2 . 0 1 . 6 1 . 2 0 . 8 Fig . 6 SWELL1 - mediated I Cl , SWELL and I KATP coordinately regulate β - cell excitability . a GCaMP6s Ca 2 + transients in WT ( Ad - RIP1 - GCaMP6s / Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ ) primary murine β - cells in response to 16 . 7 mM 3 - O - Methyl - glucose - stimulation ( basal 1 mM glucose ) and 40 mM KCl stimulation . 3 - O - Methyl - glucose fail to induce Ca 2 + transients ( n = 15 cells ) . b – e Glucose - induced Ca 2 + transients are inhibited in WT MIN6 cells ( b , c ) and in WT primary murine β - cells ( d , e ) by bumetanide ( 10 µ M ; pre - incubated in bumetanide for 2 h ) . c Mean peak Fura - 2 ratio from bumetanide - treated WT MIN6 cells ( n = 46 cells ) . d Mean peak values of GCaMP6s Ca 2 + transients from bumetanide - treated WT primary murine β - cells ( n = 7 cells ) . f , g In the presence of K ATP channel opener , diazoxide ( 100 µ M ) , glucose - induced Ca 2 + transients are abolished in WT primary murine β - cells . g Mean peak values of GCaMP6s Ca 2 + transients from WT primary murine β - cells treated with diazoxide ( n = 17 cells ) . h – j Low - dose glibenclamide ( 0 . 25 nM , 0 mM glucose ) , which is predicted to block a fraction of K ATP channels , reproducibly induced Ca 2 + transients in WT ( h ) , but not Swell1 KO ( i ) primary murine β - cells . j Mean peak values of GCaMP6s Ca 2 + transients stimulated by 0 . 25 nM glibenclamide in WT β - cells ( n = 19 cells ) and Swell1 KO β - cells ( n = 8 cells ) , and KCl - positive controls . k – m High - dose glibenclamide ( 10 nM ) , which has a maximal inhibitory effect on K ATP channels , activated Ca 2 + transients in both WT ( k ) and Swell1 KO β - cells ( l ) . m Mean peak values of GCaMP6s Ca 2 + transients stimulated by 10 nM glibenclamide in WT β - cells ( n = 4 cells ) and Swell1 KO β - cells ( n = 4 cells ) .

Under non - pathological conditions , in lean mice , SWELL1 - mediated I Cl , SWELL is primarily required for maintaining glycaemia in response to a glucose challenge — inducing a state of β - cell - dependent pre - diabetes . However , with super - imposed mild insulin resistance arising from a short course of high - fat diet ( 60 % fat for 6 weeks ) , SWELL1 - mediated I Cl , SWELL becomes important for maintaining systemic fasting glycaemia , suggesting that SWELL1 may be primarily required to sustain β - cell insulin secretion in hyper - glycemic states , as occur in the setting of T2D . Indeed , T2D islets exhibit reduced GSIS by up to 60 % 1 , 2 and this remains true even when expressed relative to total insulin content 3 . Moreover , this impairment in GSIS from T2D β - cells is largely recoverable by sulfonylurea , L - ariginine or KCl treatment in vitro 61 ; similar to our ﬁ ndings in Swell1 KO β - cells / islets . Taken together , these data raise the intriguing possibility that impaired β - cell function in T2D may arise from de ﬁ cient SWELL1 - mediated I Cl , SWELL in β - cells . We are currently testing this hypothesis . In summary , our data suggest that β - cell SWELL1 acts as a glucose sensor by coupling β - cell swelling to β - cell depolarization — a form of swell activation or swell secretion coupling — to potentiate GSIS . In the broader context of our ﬁ ndings on SWELL1 signaling in the adipocyte 25 , these data suggest that SWELL1 coordinately regulates both insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity 25 in response to a nutrient load . These ﬁ ndings high - light the importance of SWELL1 in the regulation of systemic glucose metabolism , and organismal energy homeostasis , parti - cularly in the setting of obesity .

CRISPR / Cas9 - mediated Swell1 knockout in MIN6 cells . A CRISPR / Cas9 - based tool was utilized to knockout Swell1 gene in MIN6 cells , where the target guide sequences designed using web - based CRISPR design tool ( http : / / crispr . mit . edu / ) were cloned into a bicistronic vector - expressing cas9 ( pSpCas9 ( BB ) - 2A - Puro ) 62 . Either 1A / 2B ( KO1 ) or 2B / 3C ( KO2 ) plasmids in combination were transfected into MIN6 cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 as per the manufacturer ’ s instructions ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . After a 48 h period , selection medium containing pur - omycin ( 1 µ g / ml ) was added to the cells and maintained for 5 days . Individual clones from the enriched pool were further isolated by dilution method 62 . Swell1 gene deletion was con ﬁ rmed by PCR ampli ﬁ cation spanning the double guide targeted region ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) , followed by SWELL1 western blot ( Fig . 4a and Supplementary Fig . 6b ) . Human islets . Human islets were obtained through the Integrated Islet Distribu - tion Program ( IIDP , shared with Dr John Engelhardt ) or Prodo Laboratories ( shared with Dr Yumi Imai ) . Ethical approval was not required for the in vitro studies using human islets obtained from IIDP and Prodo Laboratories . Patients were anonymous to the research team except for information of gender , age , and BMI . Islets were cultured in RPMI 1640 ( 2 % FBS ) and transferred to the laboratory within 24 h . Murine islet isolation . Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice ( 8 – 14 weeks old ) were killed by Avertin ( 0 . 0125g / ml , dissolved in H 2 O ) injection ( 20 µ l / g , i . p . ) followed by cervical dis - location according to the approved procedures . The pancreas was perfused via the common bile duct with 2 – 3ml HBSS containing type V collagenase ( 0 . 8 mg / ml ) , and then removed and digested at 37°C for 10 min . Islets were freed by gentle agitation , washed in RPMI containing 1 % FBS and puri ﬁ ed on Histopaque 1077 and 1119 gradients . Islets were then transferred to 60 mm Petri dish with culture medium for short - term culture ( < 24h ) . For GSIS experiments , islets were sorted for equal size and cultured in 24 - well plates . For isolation of primary β - cells , isolated islets were further incubated in trypsin for 5min , dispersed into single cells , and then transferred to matrigel - coated cover slips for patch clamp and calcium ﬂ uorescence imaging . Adenoviral transduction of murine and human islets . Human and murine islets were cultured in RPMI media with 2 % FBS overnight . The next day , adenovirus was added into the islet containing media ( ﬁ nal concentration of 5× 10 7 PFU / ml ) and islets incubated for 24h . The islets were then washed with PBS three times and cultured in RPMI medium with 10 % FBS for 4 – 5 days before performing further experiments . Transduction ef ﬁ ciency was assessed by ﬂ uorescence microscopy . Western blotting studies . Western blotting studies were carried out with lysates prepared from MIN6 cells by using standard techniques 63 . The primary antibodies used are listed above in antibodies and ion channel modulators . Cultured wild - type ( WT ) and the Swell1 knockout ( KO ) MIN6 cells were washed twice with ice - cold phosphate buffer saline ( PBS ) and lysed using RIPA buffer ( NaCl : 150 mM , HEPES : 20mM , NP - 40 : 1 % , EDTA : 5mM , pH 7 . 4 ) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors . The lysate was further clari ﬁ ed by sonication for about 10 – 20s of two – three cycles . The supernatant was collected from the whole lysate centrifuged at 14 , 000 rpm for 15min at 4 °C . Protein concentration was estimated by DC protein assay kit as per the manufacturer ’ s ( Bio - Rad ) instructions . For protein detection using western blot method , 20 – 50 µ g of protein was boiled in SDS loading buffer and separated using 4 – 15 % SDS - PAGE and further transferred onto a PVDF membrane . The membrane were either blocked with 5 % BSA or 5 % milk containing TBST buffer ( Tris : 0 . 2 M , NaCl : 1 . 37 M , Tween - 20 : 0 . 2 % , pH 7 . 4 ) for 1h – 100 100 – 50 – 25 25 50 75 100 125 C u rr en t den s i t y ( p A / p F ) Hypo Iso Voltage ( mV ) – 50 50 Hypo – 100 100 – 20 20 40 60 80 100 Voltage ( mV ) C u rr en t den s i t y ( p A / p F ) – 50 50 Iso L Pan β - cell Tm Liv Fat + + + – – – – 40 0 40 80 120 160 * * C u rr en t den s i t y ( p A / p F ) * * Ins1 CreERT2 ; SWELL1 fl / fl Ins1 CreERT2 ; SWELL1 fl / fl Ins1 CreERT2 ; SWELL1 fl / fl ( + ) Ins1 CreERT2 ; SWELL1 fl / fl ( + ) SWELL1 fl / fl ( + ) Wash out > 4 weeks Tm 40 – 80 mg / kg × 2 weeks 0 100 200 300 * Tm a b c d e h 120 0 100 200 300 400 500 Time ( min ) 0 30 60 90 Time ( min ) Pre - tamoxifen i Post - tamoxifen 120 0 100 200 300 400 500 0 30 60 90 j 120 0 0 30 60 90 100 200 300 400 500 Time ( min ) k B od y w e i gh t ( g ) l 0 10 20 30 40 50 ns f Minutes receiving glucose 15 15 0 0 7 7 30 30 R e l a t i v e i n s u li n s e c r e t i on * ns * * g Time ( min ) 0 10 20 30 * * * B l ood g l u c o s e ( m g / d l ) B l ood g l u c o s e ( m g / d l ) * * * * B l ood g l u c o s e ( m g / d l ) SWELL1 fl / fl ( + ) HFD HFD HFD B l ood g l u c o s e ( m g / d l ) SWELL1 fl / fl ( – ) Ins1 CreERT2 ; SWELL1 fl / fl ( – ) SWELL1 fl / fl ( + ) Ins1 CreERT2 ; SWELL1 fl / fl ( + ) SWELL1 fl / fl ( + ) Ins1 CreERT2 ; SWELL1 fl / fl ( + ) SWELL1 fl / fl ( + ) Ins1 CreERT2 ; SWELL1 fl / fl ( + ) SWELL1 fl / fl ( + ) Ins1 CreERT2 ; SWELL1 fl / fl ( + ) SWELL1 fl / fl ( + ) Ins1 CreERT2 ; SWELL1 fl / fl ( + ) SWELL1 fl / fl ( + ) Ins1 CreERT2 ; SWELL1 fl / fl ( + ) 2 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 . 0 I n s u li n ( ng / m l ) 2 . 5 2 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 0 0 . 0 0 . 5 120 0 100 200 300 400 500 0 30 60 90 Time ( min ) * B l ood g l u c o s e ( m g / d l ) SWELL1 fl / fl ( + ) Ins1 CreERT2 ; SWELL1 fl / fl ( + ) Tm CreERT2 S W E LL1 f l / f l Fig . 8 Tamoxifen - inducible , β - cell - targeted Swell1 deletion impairs glucose - stimulated insulin secretion and systemic glycaemia . a Tamoxifen ( Tm ) - inducible β - cell - targeted Swell1 inactivation using Ins1 CreERT2 mouse crossed with Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice ( Ins1 CreERT2 ; Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ ) . b PCR across S well1 Exon 3 in genomic DNA extracted from pancreas , liver , and adipose tissues of Ins1 CreERT2 ; Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice treated with ( + ) or without ( − ) tamoxifen .

These mice were then backcrossed > 8 generations into a C57B6 background . Generation of tamoxifen - inducible β - cell - targeted Swell1 KO mice . The gen - eration of homozygous ﬂ oxed Swell1 mice ( Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice ) in which exon 3 is ﬂ anked by loxP sites is described above . Tamoxifen - inducible β - cell - targeted Swell 1 KO were generated by crossing Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice with Ins1 CreERT2 mice 40 ( Jackson Laboratory ) to produce Ins1 CreERT2 ; Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice . Offsprings were genotyped by PCR using Ins1 CreERT2 and Swell1 ﬂ oxed allele - speci ﬁ c primers : Ins1 CreERT2 - F : 5 ′ - TGGACTATAAAGCTGGTGGGCAT - 3 ′ Ins1 CreERT2 - R : 5 ′ - TGCGAACCTCATCACTCGT - 3 ′ Swell1 ﬂ - F : 5 ′ - CTAATCAGGGAGAGACAGCAGAG - 3 ′ Swell1 ﬂ - R : 5 ′ - GATAGTTCTGGCCAGTGAGTGG - 3 ′ To achieve tamoxifen - induced β - cell - targeted Swell1 recombination , Ins1 CreERT2 ; Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice ( 6 – 8 - week - old males ) , were treated by oral gavage with tamoxifen 40 – 80 mg / kg ( Sigma - Aldrich , T6648 ) dissolved in sun ﬂ ower seed oil ( Sigma - Aldrich , S5007 ) ﬁ ve times over a 2 - week period . Littermate , gender - matched Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice treated with tamoxifen as above served as controls ( WT ) . To test for recombination ef ﬁ ciency Ins1 CreERT2 ; Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice were then crossed with Rosa26 - tdTomato mice to generate Ins1 CreERT2 ; Rosa26 - tdTomato ; Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice . Mice were studied at least 4 weeks after the last tamoxifen dose to allow time for any non - speci ﬁ c effects of tamoxifen to wash - out . All mice used were maintained on a C57BL / 6 background . Confocal microscopy . To assess recombination ef ﬁ ciency of Ins1 CreERT2 mice , we isolated islets from tamoxifen - induced and untreated Ins1 CreERT2 ; Rosa26 - tdTo - mato ; Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice and imaged freshly isolated islets with a Zeiss LSM510 con - focal laser scanning microscope ( Zeiss , NY , USA ) using a 20x / 0 . 8 NA objective lens . Islets were excited by 561nm light and emission signals were recorded at 581 nm in a tile mode ( 5× 5 ) in order to observe the tdTomato ﬂ uorescence in larger ﬁ elds of view . Then all 25 individual frames were tiled together to form the complete image . All images were processed and analyzed with ZEN 2009 ( Zeiss ) software . Glucose tolerance test . Mice were deprived of food for 6h and then injected with glucose ( intraperitoneal , 2 g / kg body weight ) . Blood was then collected via the tail at 0 , 5 , 15 , 30 , 60 , 90 , and 120 min after the glucose injection . For HFD mice , 1g / kg glucose was injected ( i . p . ) . Glucose levels in the collected blood were determined by blood glucose meter ( Bayer HealthCare LLC ) . In vivo insulin secretion assay . For in vivo measurements of GSIS , tamoxifen - induced Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ and Ins1 CreERT2 ; Swell1 ﬂ / ﬂ mice ( littermate , gender - matched ) were fasted 6h prior to the experiments . Blood samples were collected from the tail vein with microvette ( Sarstedt , 16 . 444 . 100 ) before the injection of glucose as 0 min time point . Mice were then injected with 2g / kg ( BW ) glucose ( i . p . ) . Blood samples were collected from the tail vein at 7 , 15 , and 30 min time points and centrifuged for plasma collection ( 2000 × g , 20 min , 4°C ) . Plasma insulin concentrations were determined by using an ELISA kit ( Crystal Chem Inc . , 90080 ) . Statistics . Data are represented as mean ± s . e . m . Two - tail paired or unpaired Student ’ s t - tests were used for comparison between groups . For three or more groups , data were analyzed by one - way analysis of variance and Tukey ’ s post hoc test . For glucose tolerance test , data were analyzed by two - way analysis of variance and Tukey ’ s post hoc test . A probability of p < 0 . 05 was considered to be statisti - cally signi ﬁ cant .
