And the contact patterns 37 in Fujian Province , China , have not been described . We identified 8 , 969 38 transmission pairs in Fujian , China , by analyzing a contact - tracing database that 39 recorded a SARS - CoV - 2 outbreak in September 2021 . We estimated the waning 40 vaccine effectiveness against Delta variant infection , contact patterns , and 41 epidemiology distributions , then simulated potential outbreaks of Delta and 42 Omicron variants using a multi - group mathematical model . For instance , in the 43 contact setting without stringent lockdowns , we estimated that in a potential 44 Omicron wave , only 4 . 7 % of infections would occur in Fujian Province among 45 individuals aged > 60 years . In comparison , 58 . 75 % of the death toll would occur 46 in unvaccinated individuals aged > 60 years . Compared with no strict lockdowns , 47 combining school or factory closure alone reduced cumulative deaths of Delta 48 and Omicron by 28 . 5 % and 6 . 1 % , respectively . In conclusion , this study validates 49 the need for continuous mass immunization , especially among elderly aged over 50 60 years old . And it confirms that the effect of lockdowns alone in reducing 51 infections or deaths is minimal . However , these measurements will still 52 contribute to lowering peak daily incidence and delaying the epidemic , easing the 53 healthcare system ' s burden . 54 Keywords : contact tracing ; vaccine effectiveness ; variant of concern ; 55 mathematical model ; COVID - 19 56 1 . Introduction 57 The coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic is still spreading worldwide . In 58 China , the Delta variant ( B . 1 . 617 . 2 ) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome 59 coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) was first reported on April 22 , 2021 ( Ye et al . , 2021 ) , 60 then became the dominant strain and caused outbreaks with local transmission across 61 China up till December 2021 ( Wu et al . , 2022 ; M . Zhang et al . , 2021 ; Zhou et al . , 2021 ) . 62 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 Afterward , the highly contagious Omicron variant was introduced and disseminated 63 throughout China . From March 1 through April 18 , 2022 , 497 , 214 local Omicron 64 infections have been spilled over to 31 provinces in mainland China except for Tibet 65 Autonomous Region , generating multiple waves of COVID - 19 epidemic ( National 66 Health Commission of China . Press conference held on situation regarding strict 67 prevention and control of COVID - 19 epidemic . , 2022 ) . 68 China began to provide free COVID - 19 vaccine shots in December 2020 ( Zheng 69 et al . , 2021 ) . The largest share was the inactivated vaccines against SARS - CoV - 2 by 70 two manufacturers , Sinovac ( CoronaVac ) and Sinopharm ( BBIBP - Cov ) . In real - world 71 analyses , it has been observed that a single dose of inactivated vaccine was not 72 sufficiently protective against Delta infection . Two doses of inactivated COVID - 19 73 vaccines were effective against symptomatic when the Delta variant was prevalent 74 ( Kang et al . , 2022 ; Wu et al . , 2022 ) . Meanwhile , studies have also shown that 75 inactivated vaccines provide sufficient protection against severe COVID - 19 illness and 76 death even when Delta and Omicron are circulating ( Al Kaabi et al . , 2021 ; Jara et al . , 77 2021 ; McMenamin et al . , 2022 ; Tanriover et al . , 2021 ) . However , concerns have been 78 raised about the possibility that inactivated vaccines may follow the same pattern of 79 declining vaccine - induced immunity as findings describing reductions in the 80 effectiveness of mRNA - based vaccinations against infection as a function of time ( Abu - 81 Raddad et al . , 2022 ; Chemaitelly et al . , 2021 ; Cohn et al . , 2022 ; D . - Y . Lin et al . , 2022 ; 82 Tartof et al . , 2021 ) . Test - negative , case - control studies in Brazil validated the waning 83 effectiveness of CoronaVac against both Delta and Omicron infection ( Cerqueira - Silva 84 et al . , 2022 ; Ranzani et al . , 2022 ) . 85 Although several studies have compared the relative severity of Omicron and 86 Delta variants by assessing the relative risks ( Nyberg et al . , 2022 ; Ulloa et al . , 2022 ; 87 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 Veneti et al . , 2022 ) , there are still gaps in the knowledge of the potential COVID - 19 88 burden these variations may cause . And the contact patterns in Fujian Province have not 89 been described . Since changes in social contact patterns shaped the dynamics of the 90 COVID - 19 outbreak , they can guide and inform more realistic representations of 91 parameters in mathematical models for infectious diseases . According to studies , 92 lockdowns or social distancing alone are sufficient to contain sporadic COVID - 19 93 during the circulation of wild - type SARS - CoV - 2 ( Zhang et al . , 2020 ; J . Zhang et al . , 94 2021 ) . More information on whether measures like lockdown alone remain sufficient to 95 control Delta or Omicron transmission and death would help to inform mitigation 96 strategies . 97 Here , we estimated the effectiveness of inactivated vaccines after full 98 vaccination in the context of a Delta outbreak in Fujian Province , China . We analyzed 99 the contact pairs tracked over the outbreak period and quantified age - mixing contact 100 patterns among different contact settings . Specifically , we developed a multi - group 101 mathematical model to simulate and compare transmission and death of potential Delta 102 and Omicron outbreaks in Fujian Province based on vaccination status and contact 103 patterns extracted from contact tracing data . 104 105 2 . Material and methods 106 2 . 1 . Setting and Subjects 107 In a Delta variant outbreak that began in Putian City and spread to other cities in Fujian , 108 China , from September 4 to September 30 , 2021 , close contacts were linked to reverse 109 transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) tests confirmed COVID - 19 index 110 cases . An imported case from abroad sparked this outbreak . However , it was initially 111 detected at a primary school in a sample nucleic acid test conducted by the Putian 112 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 government after the autumn school opening . All cases were then promptly traced and 113 isolated according to national and provincial protocols for COVID - 19 prevention and 114 control ( eighth edition ) ( National Health Commission of the People ' s Republic of 115 China . The Prevention and Control Scheme of COVID - 19 . 8th ed . In Chinese . 11 May 116 2021 . ) . There was no previous infection in all cases . Close contacts were managed to be 117 traced as well and quarantined . Close contacts include those who lived in the same 118 household or stayed in the same public space without protection within close proximity 119 in the two days before symptom onset for symptomatic cases or sampling of the first 120 positive specimen for asymptomatic cases ( the detailed identification principles were 121 the same as previous literature mentioned ) ( Kang et al . , 2022 ) . The Fujian Provincial 122 Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( Fujian CDC ) compiled the contact - tracing 123 database , including index cases and their close contacts . Demographic information and 124 vaccination status were obtained for both . Additionally , the date of symptom onset , date 125 of isolation order issued , clinical outcomes , PCR cycle threshold ( Ct ) values , date of 126 PCR test , and occupations were obtained for infected individuals . And the age - 127 structured population of Fujian province was sourced from the Statistical Yearbook in 128 2021 ( Statistical Yearbook of Fujian Province , China . , 2021 ) . 129 2 . 2 . Vaccination Status 130 The contact - tracing database provided vaccination status ( i . e . , vaccine type , number of 131 doses received , and corresponding date of vaccination ) from the national medical 132 insurance system for each close contact . Of note , no close contacts who were involved 133 in this outbreak received a booster dose . The fully vaccinated group consisted of 134 individuals exposed to infected people after 14 days had elapsed since their second 135 dose . Since the exact date of exposure was quite difficult to identify , we used the time 136 from a close contact receiving the second dose to the exact date of its index case’s 137 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 7 symptom onset to determine the fully vaccinated group instead . We did a sensitivity 138 analysis to determine the fully vaccinated group , using the time since close contact 139 receiving the second dose to the exact date of its related index case being isolated . The 140 partially vaccinated group consisted of those who received the first dose or people who 141 received the second dose within 14 days before the exposure . The unvaccinated group 142 consisted of individuals who had not received any inactivated vaccines prior to 143 exposure to a confirmed case . Analyses from studies showed that partial vaccination 144 with the inactivated vaccine was ineffective against the Delta variant infection ( Kang et 145 al . , 2022 ; Wu et al . , 2022 ) . We performed a multivariable logistic regression , and the 146 results confirmed no statistically significant difference against infection between the 147 partially vaccinated and unvaccinated groups ( see Appendix ) . Therefore , we paired 148 unvaccinated and partially vaccinated people together and classified them as 149 unvaccinated . 150 2 . 3 . Contact Patterns Estimation 151 We analyzed index case and close contact pairs during the entire outbreak period . The 152 overall contact matrix relies on all connections among the contact - tracing data , 153 representing a setting without stringent lockdowns . School and factory contact settings 154 were categorized by extracting close contacts of occupation - specific index cases 155 ( students , teachers , and workers ) . A contact setting combined school and factory closure 156 was developed by removing close contacts generated by index cases with the 157 occupations of students , teachers , and workers . Contact matrices 𝐶 mentioned above 158 were constructed with seven age groups ( 0 to 9 years , 10 to 19 years , 20 to 29 years , 30 159 to 39 years , 40 to 49 years , 50 to 59 years , and more than 60 years old ) , with its 𝑖𝑗 - th 160 entry 𝑐 𝑖𝑗 represents the average number of daily contacts produced by members of age 161 group 𝑖 with members of age group 𝑗 . And the total number of people in age group 𝑖 is 162 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 8 𝑁 𝑖 . We quantified the uncertainty of contact matrices using a 1000 - times bootstrap with 163 replacement on the original dataset . The 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) on the mean 164 were calculated by bootstrap sampling and were weighted by the age - dependent 165 population size of the Fujian province . 166 2 . 4 . Statistical Analyses 167 We described the demographic and clinical outcomes of close contacts and index cases 168 in Fujian province , stratified by vaccination status . The Statistical analyses section of 169 the Appendix gives additional information on this ( National Health Commission of 170 China , National Traditional Chinese Medicine Administration . Diagnosis and treatment 171 protocol for COVID - 19 patients . In Chinese . ( revised tentative 8th edition ) . 14 April 172 2021 . ) . We established a retrospective cohort to assess the waning vaccine effectiveness 173 against Delta variant associated infection . The vaccination status was classified as time - 174 dependent . It is a covariate that can change over time with all close contacts entering the 175 cohort as having not yet received any dose . And the terminal event was defined as close 176 contact developing symptoms or the last new case reported . Adjusted hazard ratios 177 ( aHRs ) with 95 % CIs were estimated by comparing rates of Delta variant infection 178 among fully vaccinated with unvaccinated individuals by including all measured 179 covariates in the Cox model . Variables in the model were age group ( same as contact 180 matrix ) and sex of close contacts , the same age group , sex , and days from symptom 181 onset to the isolation of index cases . VE was calculated as : ( 1 – aHRs ) multiplied by 182 100 % . Due to limitation in sample size , vaccine effectiveness analyses were not 183 stratified by age . Statistical comparisons of vaccine effectiveness by time since 184 vaccination were made using the likelihood ratio test and Wald 𝜒 2 tests for contrasts 185 within the Cox model . We also performed a sensitivity analysis regarding another 186 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 determination of the fully vaccinated group ( i . e . , determining by time since a close 187 contact receiving the second dose to the exact date of its index case being isolated ) . 188 We fitted the observed and truncated serial interval ( time interval between 189 symptom onsets in a ‘index case - close contact’ pair ) with three distributions ( Gamma , 190 lognormal , and Weibull ) using maximum likelihood estimation . The truncated data 191 removed negative and zero - valued serial intervals . The goodness of fit was assessed 192 using the Akaike information criterion with correction ( AICc ) . The joint distribution of 193 PCR cycle threshold ( Ct ) values and days since symptom onset was obtained using a 194 two - dimensional kernel density estimation with a normal kernel stratified by 195 vaccination status . Data analysis was conducted using R ( version 4 . 1 . 2 , R Foundation ) . 196 2 . 5 . Model Development 197 An age and vaccination status specific multi - groups model based on the natural history 198 of COVID - 19 was developed . There are six compartments in each group : susceptible 199 ( S ) , exposed ( E ) , pre - symptomatic ( P ) , infectious ( I ) , asymptomatic ( A ) , and 200 recovered / removed ( R ) ( Appendix Fig . 1 ) . The dynamic SEPIAR model with a pre - 201 symptomatic phase ( P ) was validated by the serial interval distribution fitted in the 202 present study ( Fig . 1b , Appendix Fig . 4 ) , since the average serial interval is shorter than 203 the average incubation period , which matches those obtained in earlier studies ( Du et 204 al . , 2020 ; Hu et al . , 2021 ; Prete Jr et al . , 2021 ) . The pre - symptomatic is a status in 205 transmission dynamics before the symptom onset of the infectious compartment I . The 206 SEPIAR model was based on several assumptions ( Model development section in 207 Appendix ) . 208 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 2 . 6 . Parameter Estimation 209 Parameters of natural history , including 𝜅 1 , 𝜅 2 , 𝜇 , 1 / 𝜔 , 1 / 𝜔 ′ , 1 / 𝜔 ′′ , 1 / 210 𝛾 and 1 / 𝛾 ′ are defined in Appendix Table 4 . According to two systematic reviews , the 211 relative transmission rate from pre - symptomatic and asymptomatic to symptomatic was 212 0 . 58 ( 95 % CI , 0 . 34 to 0 . 99 ) and 0 . 63 ( 95 % CI , 0 . 18 to 2 . 26 ) , respectively ( Buitrago - 213 Garcia et al . , 2020 ; Byambasuren et al . , 2020 ) . Analyses regarding the proportion of 214 asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infections have been heterogeneous . A series of systematic 215 reviews and meta - analyses revealed that the proportion of people who tested positive 216 for COVID - 19 who never exhibited symptoms ranged from 8 . 44 % ( 95 % CI , 5 . 12 to 217 13 . 62 ) to 39 % ( 95 % CI , 20 . 4 to 61 . 4 ) ( Buitrago - Garcia et al . , 2020 ; Byambasuren et al . , 218 2020 ; Chen et al . , 2021 ; He et al . , 2021 ; Syangtan et al . , 2021 ) . The asymptomatic 219 proportion of Delta variant infection ( 33 % ) we used in this study was determined from 220 infections in mainland China from April 22 , 2021 , to August 8 , 2021 , as displayed in a 221 reference ( Gao et al . , 2021 ) . And the asymptomatic proportion did not differ between 222 fully vaccinated and unvaccinated groups ( Singanayagam et al . , 2022 ) . Another study 223 conducted simulations and hypotheses on parameters 1 / 𝜔 , 1 / 𝜔 ′ , 1 / 𝜔 ′′ , 1 / 𝛾 and 224 1 / 𝛾 ′ , the days from exposed to asymptomatic and pre - symptomatic ( 1 / 𝜔 , 1 / 𝜔 ′ ) were 225 both set to 3 ( 2 to 5 ) , which was adopted from Delta outbreaks in Guangzhou city and 226 Hunan province by Monte Carlo simulations . The general linear model was also adapted 227 to fit the parameter 1 / 𝛾 to 5 ( 4 to 6 ) , representing days from symptomatic to removed 228 ( Chen et al . , 2022 ) . Because asymptomatic individuals are more difficult to identify 229 than symptomatic cases , they are expected to wander around before an isolation order is 230 issued for a longer time . Based on this assumption , 1 / 𝛾 ′ was set to 7 days . The case 231 fatality rate ( CFR ) caused by Omicron was derived from the epidemic situation 232 announced by the Center for Health Protection of the Department of Health in Hong 233 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 11 Kong as of April 6 , 2022 ( The Centre for Health Protection of the Department of 234 Health . Latest situation of COVID - 19 ( as of 6 April 2022 ) . ) . The report provided CFR 235 by age group and vaccination status since the fifth wave . According to studies that 236 estimate vaccination against hospital admission and deaths , the effectiveness showed no 237 significant waning for several months after the second dose ( Abu - Raddad et al . , 2022 ; 238 D . - Y . Lin et al . , 2022 ; Tartof et al . , 2021 ) . It is legitimate to assume that vaccination 239 against death remained stable after full immunization . No deaths occurred in the study 240 population of contact - tracing data we used . The CFR caused by Delta was set 241 proportionally to the Omicron variant , as a study suggested that Omicron had a 69 % 242 lower risk of death than Delta cases . Strong evidence of this risk reduction was seen in 243 all age groups ( Nyberg et al . , 2022 ) . The CFRs are summarized in Appendix Table 5 . 244 The vaccine effectiveness by time since the second dose against Omicron infection was 245 collected from another report of Omicron - driven fifth wave in Hong Kong ( HKUMed 246 updates on modelling the fifth wave of COVID - 19 in Hong Kong . 10 February 2022 . ) . 247 We then derivate the expression for the interactive 𝑅 𝑖𝑗 of SEPIAR model 248 through a definition - based method ( Appendix ) ( Guo et al . , 2022 ) . The expression is as 249 follows : 250 𝑅 𝑖𝑗 = 𝛽 𝑖𝑗 𝑁 𝑗 𝜇 𝑖 𝜔 𝑖 + ( 1 − 𝜇 𝑖 ) 𝜔 𝑖′ ( 𝜅 2 𝜇 𝑖 𝜔 𝑖 𝛾 𝑖′ + 𝜅 1 ( 1 − 𝜇 𝑖 ) 𝜔 𝑖′ 𝜔 𝑖′′ + ( 1 − 𝜇 𝑖 ) 𝜔 𝑖′ 𝛾 𝑖 ) ( 1 ) 251 Coefficient 𝛽 𝑖𝑗 is the transmission rate from group 𝑖 to group 𝑗 , which can be 252 formularized as the following equation : 253 𝛽 𝑖𝑗 𝑁 𝑖 = 𝑐 𝑗𝑖 𝑞𝜎 𝑗 ( 2 ) 254 where 𝑁 𝑖 is the total number of people in group 𝑖 , 𝑐 𝑗𝑖 is the 𝑗𝑖 - th entry of contact 255 matrix 𝐶 , 𝑞 is the probability of contracting SARS - CoV - 2 from a single contact , 𝜎 𝑗 is 256 the relative susceptibility of group 𝑗 . We assumed 𝜎 𝑗 to be 1 in every subgroup , 257 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 12 considering the whole population is susceptible to SARS - CoV - 2 to the same degree 258 without considering the impact of VE . 259 The matrix of transmission rate among seven age groups ( same groups as the 260 contact matrix ) can be derived from the expression of 𝑅 0 along with the leading 261 eigenvalue of contact matrix 𝐶 ( Appendix ) . 262 2 . 7 . Simulation method 263 We considered the impact of VE in the model framework as relative risks 1 − 𝑉𝐸 𝑖𝑗 , 264 among different protection levels of full vaccination to those unvaccinated . These levels 265 include waning VE at 14 - 30 days , 31 - 60 days , and > 60 days after the second dose . 266 According to a steady weekly vaccination rate , we assume that throughout the one - year 267 simulation period , the proportion of each vaccination group in the susceptible 268 compartment among the entire population of Fujian Province will remain constant . The 269 simulations for different closure settings in the SEPIAR model were performed by 270 deriving transmission rate coefficient 𝛽 matrices based on age - structured contact 271 matrices . The simulation for the Delta variant was in the context of real - world 272 vaccination effectiveness estimated in this study . For the Omicron variant , we used 273 accessible VEs in the report from Hong Kong . Both Delta and Omicron simulations 274 started in September 2021 and were under the contact patterns estimated from the 275 contact - tracing data in Fujian , China . 276 277 3 . Results 278 3 . 1 . Contact tracing data analysis 279 Of 288 PCR - positive close contacts , 286 individuals developed symptoms . We 280 identified 7 . 34 % ( 21 / 286 ) negative serial intervals ( symptom onset in close contact 281 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 13 precedes their index case ) and 8 . 39 % ( 24 / 286 ) zero - valued serial intervals . We found 282 that the best fitting distribution of the measured serial interval by AICc was a Weibull 283 distribution with a mean of 3 . 64 days and a standard deviation of 3 . 63 days ( Fig . 1b ) . 284 The mean of the truncated serial interval was 4 . 56 with a standard deviation of 3 . 11 and 285 a median of 3 . 89 days , based on a Gamma distribution ( Appendix Fig . 4 ) . We also 286 estimated the joint distribution of Ct values and days since symptom onset . As for 287 unvaccinated individuals ' density of ORF1ab gene Ct values at the symptom onset date 288 was found to be the highest with the lowest Ct values . And there is a noticeable density 289 appearing before symptom onset ( Fig . 1c ) . However , the highest density with the lowest 290 Ct values was found one day after symptom onset for fully vaccinated people , and no 291 density appeared before symptom onset . Likewise , this difference appears in N gene Ct 292 values ( Fig . 1d ) . 293 We analyzed 8 , 969 close contacts linked to 367 unique index cases based on the 294 two days of contact - tracing for each index case . The age - mixing patterns of overall , 295 school , factory , and community or others contact settings are demonstrated in Figure 2 . 296 The matrix of the overall setting presents an assortative mixing pattern , meaning people 297 tend to meet people of their own age group . It has a mean of 13 . 26 ( 95 % CI , 12 . 96 to 298 13 . 57 ) contacts per participant in all age groups , and the highest number of contacts is 299 recorded in the lower left quadrant of the matrix , corresponding to contacts between 300 school - aged children . The contacts of middle - aged people are displayed in the center 301 section of the matrix . The school contact matrix focuses on interactions between 302 students , students and teachers , and teachers , whereas the factory contact matrix depicts 303 interactions between workers . The mean reported contacts in schools is 9 . 11 ( 95 % CI , 304 8 . 78 to 9 . 44 ) compared with a mean of 3 . 59 ( 95 % CI , 3 . 49 to 3 . 69 ) contacts in factories . 305 The last matrix shows the contacts between children aged 0 to 9 years old as they move 306 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 14 around the community , middle - aged people as they interact within household or at other 307 workplaces , and people over 60 years old as they interact within household . In a 308 ‘Community or others’ contact setting , the average number of contacts is 7 . 57 ( 95 % CI , 309 7 . 17 to 7 . 96 ) . 310 As shown in Figure 1a , the effectiveness of inactivated vaccines ( Sinovac and 311 Sinopharm ) against Delta infection decreased with time since vaccination , declining 312 from 63 . 49 % ( 95 % CI , 39 . 51 % to 77 . 97 % , P < 0 . 001 ) during 14 - 30 days after receiving 313 the second dose to 56 . 00 % ( 95 % CI , 32 . 02 % to 71 . 52 % , P < 0 . 001 ) during 31 - 60 days 314 after the second dose . And then , the VE keeps decreasing to 45 . 96 % ( 95 % CI , 23 . 41 % 315 to 61 . 88 % , P < 0 . 001 ) after 60 days . Sensitivity analysis suggests using different time 316 points to determine a fully vaccinated group has only a slight difference in waning VEs 317 ( blue and red error bars in Fig . 1a ) . 318 3 . 2 . Model simulation 319 The projected trend of daily new infections per 10 , 000 people induced by Delta and 320 Omicron variant are shown in Figure 3 . First , our simulation suggests that adults aged 321 over 60 years in Fujian Province will have the lowest curve of daily new infections , 322 provided there are no restrictions on controlling the contact ( i . e . , in the ‘Overall’ 323 setting ) . Second , when compared with the unvaccinated group , all fully vaccinated 324 groups have flattened the incidence curve ( reduce peak incidence and delay the 325 epidemic ) produced by Delta variant . And with time elapsed since full vaccination , the 326 ‘flattening effect’ is weakened . However , as the dashed lines in Figure 3 showed , this 327 effect is barely displayed in the Omicron epidemic simulation . Third , in the 328 corresponding setting where contacts in both school and factory are suppressed , the 329 Delta wave ended 358 days after its outbreak . In comparison , the Omicron wave ended 330 122 days after the outbreak and with roughly twice the number of peak incidences . 331 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 15 As shown in Figure 4 , school closure reduces peak daily incidence the most at 332 10 - 19 years old by 79 . 55 % and 47 . 89 % in Delta and Omicron epidemics , respectively . 333 Most reductions of peak daily incidence attributed to factory closure were 33 . 84 % and 334 13 . 07 % in 50 - 59 years age group among Delta and Omicron epidemics , respectively . 335 When combining school and factory closure measurements , peak Delta - induced daily 336 incidence reduction ranged from 64 . 84 % to 92 . 00 % across age groups . While during an 337 Omicron wave , this reduction ranged from 20 . 65 % to 63 . 14 % . 338 We estimated cumulative infection and death caused by Delta and Omicron 339 stratified by contact setting and vaccination status . First , among the four contact settings 340 we constructed , only 3 . 3 % to 3 . 5 % of infections would occur in individuals aged > 60 341 years in the Delta wave . It would be between 4 . 6 % to 4 . 9 % in the Omicron wave ( Fig . 342 5a ) . However , 77 . 3 % to 77 . 8 % of the death toll would occur among elderly aged > 60 343 years in the Delta wave . In the Omicron wave , the death toll ranges from 80 . 3 % to 344 80 . 5 % ( Fig . 5b ) . Second , among the four contact settings , a potential Omicron outbreak 345 corresponds to an increase of 7 . 6 % to 32 . 9 % in the number of cumulative infections 346 when compared with Delta variant . In contrast , the cumulative mortality was 0 . 31 to 347 0 . 41 times the death of Delta variant . Third , compared to the overall contact setting , 348 closing schools and factories simultaneously had limited effects on reducing the death 349 toll of Delta and Omicron by 28 . 5 % and 6 . 1 % , respectively . Nonetheless , the fully 350 vaccinated group exhibited a significant reduction in the death toll . The fully vaccinated 351 group accounted for only 20 . 0 % to 22 . 5 % of cumulative deaths given the four contact 352 settings during a Delta wave , and 29 . 0 % to 29 . 2 % during an Omicron wave ( Fig . 5 ) . 353 4 . Discussion 354 In the present study , we estimated the age - dependent contact matrices using a contact - 355 tracing database in which every close contact is linked to an index case . The average 356 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 16 numbers of contacts per day per person were in agreement with questionnaire - based 357 contact surveys conducted in Shanghai in 2018 ( Zhang et al . , 2019 ) and Japan in 2014 358 ( Munasinghe et al . , 2019 ) . The results were also within the range of contact rates 359 estimated in four Chinese cities ( Wuhan , Shanghai , Shenzhen , and Changsha ) in 2020 360 ( J . Zhang et al . , 2021 ) . Besides , using a contact - tracing database to estimate contact 361 patterns has several advantages compared with the frequently used POLYMOD survey 362 ( Mossong et al . , 2008 ) . First , the contact - tracing data is less prone to recall bias than the 363 retrospective questionnaire survey ( Feehan & Mahmud , 2021 ; Mossong et al . , 2008 ) 364 due to comprehensive epidemiology investigation and digital information provided by 365 government agencies . Second , the criteria in contact - tracing protocol cover an extensive 366 range of contacts . In contrast , the definition of contact in a questionnaire - based survey 367 was less exhaustive , whether the design was prospective or retrospective ( Hoang et al . , 368 2019 ) . However , the contact patterns estimated by the contact - tracing data are limited to 369 the period of the outbreak and may underestimate the contact rate in the absence of 370 lockdowns . In comparison , the POLYMOD survey’s contact diary can be readily 371 accepted and is broadly representative of contact patterns on a daily basis ( Mossong et 372 al . , 2008 ) . 373 Using a Cox model , our study estimated the waning effectiveness of inactivated 374 COVID - 19 vaccines against Delta infections after the second dose . During the Gamma 375 and Delta variant circulation in Brazil , the VE of CoronaVac against infection was 376 estimated using surveillance databases and revealed a temporal trend of 55 . 0 % ( 95 % CI , 377 54 . 3 to 55 . 7 ) at 14 - 30 days after the second dose , decreasing to 34 . 7 % ( 95 % CI , 33 . 1 to 378 36 . 2 ) over 180 days after the second dose ( Cerqueira - Silva et al . , 2022 ) . Of note , a 379 pattern shared by the VE of mRNA vaccines peaked or remained stable during the first 380 one to two months after full immunization , then fell progressively or rapidly after that 381 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 17 ( Chemaitelly et al . , 2021 ; Cohn et al . , 2022 ; D . - Y . Lin et al . , 2022 ; Tartof et al . , 2021 ) . 382 However , the waning VE of inactivated vaccines from the present and the previous 383 study ( Cerqueira - Silva et al . , 2022 ) showed only a downtrend . 384 Among the four contact settings , the Omicron - induced cumulative infection was 385 projected to increase by 7 . 6 % to 32 . 9 % compared with the Delta outbreak . In contrast , 386 the cumulative mortality of Omicron was 0 . 31 to 0 . 41 times the death of Delta variant . 387 These results accord with cohort studies which found Omicron infection has a lower 388 risk of severe outcomes than Delta ( Hyams et al . , 2022 ; Nyberg et al . , 2022 ) . For 389 instance , in the contact setting without stringent lockdowns , we estimated that in a 390 potential Omicron wave , only 4 . 7 % of infections would occur in Fujian Province among 391 individuals aged > 60 years , while 58 . 75 % of the death toll would occur in unvaccinated 392 individuals aged > 60 years ( 14271 people ) . According to our simulation , the effect of 393 lockdown alone to control infections or deaths caused by Delta or Omicron outbreaks is 394 limited , but the impact of receiving vaccines in reducing the absolute number in death 395 toll was well marked . These findings are comparable to studies that showed that the 396 vaccination campaign provided protection against Delta and Omicron caused mortality 397 ( Buchan et al . , 2022 ; L . Lin et al . , 2022 ) . Additionally , corroborate the findings in 398 larger - scale modelling studies ( Bubar et al . , 2021 ; Monod et al . , 2021 ) that the 399 resurgence of COVID - 19 was primarily driven by adults 20 to 49 years of age with 400 highly effective transmission . But the priority of vaccines should be given to the elderly 401 over 60 if reducing fatalities is the goal . Continually stringent lockdowns may not be the 402 best option in the long run , school or factory or even combined school and factory 403 closure cannot sufficiently reduce infection or death on their own . Still , it is important 404 to stress that they can reduce peak incidence and delay the epidemic for months . A 405 study has suggested that implementing such strict intervention can help prevent the 406 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 18 collapse of the healthcare system ( Cai et al . , 2022 ) . Additionally , the joint distribution 407 of Ct values and days since symptom onset suggests that the full vaccination may 408 postpone the peak viral load to after symptom onset . Thus , people who have been fully 409 vaccinated yet have been infected tend to be most contagious when they are at a stage 410 where public health practitioners may easily detect them ( due to detectable symptoms ) 411 and isolate them in time . An implication of this is that a full vaccination regimen may 412 reduce the proportion of pre - symptomatic transmission , which can significantly help 413 disease control . 414 In summary , this study validates the need for continuous mass immunization , 415 especially among elderly aged over 60 years old . And it confirms that the effect of 416 lockdowns alone in reducing infections or deaths is minimal . However , these 417 measurements will still contribute to reducing peak daily incidence and delaying the 418 epidemic , easing the healthcare system ' s burden . 419 Our study has several limitations . First , hospitalization and death were not used 420 as outcomes in VE evaluation because all COVID - 19 patients were admitted to hospital 421 regardless of severity in China in 2021 . In the present study , only seven patients became 422 severe illness , and zero death cases , so we referred to the death rate reported in the fifth 423 wave of COVID - 19 in Hong Kong , which grouped the population the same as this study 424 applied . Second , none of the close contacts received booster shots before the outbreak in 425 Fujian Province in September 2021 . We considered the waning effectiveness by 426 assuming the fraction of each vaccination group in the susceptible compartment is 427 constant over the simulation period . Further studies may consider adding a VE declining 428 function from real - world data partitioned by age groups and vaccination status ( with a 429 booster vaccinated group ) into mathematical models to guide more realistic 430 representations for SARS - CoV - 2 transmission . Third , vaccine coverage varies among 431 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 19 provinces due to different speeds of the vaccination campaign , though in general , the 432 problem of lower vaccination coverage among the elderly exists in all regions . Research 433 should be undertaken to refine region - specific vaccination coverages , contact patterns , 434 and migrations between regions , which are instrumental in evaluating region - specific 435 reopening strategies in China . 436 Funding 437 This work was supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation ( INV - 005834 ) , 438 Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province ( NO . 2021J01353 and NO . 2020J01094 ) , 439 and National Science and Technology Major Project of the Ministry of Science and 440 Technology of China ( NO . 2018ZX10734402 - 007 ) , Research on accurate prediction and 441 timely response system for outbreaks of new infectious diseases ( SRPG2200702 ) . 442 Author contributions 443 YCG , WJY , ZYZ , and TMC conceived and designed the study .

( a ) The duration of vaccine effectiveness against Delta variant infection was estimated by adjusted Cox model by time since full vaccination . The blue error bars represent using time since a close contact receiving second dose to the exact date of its index case’s symptom onset to determine fully vaccinated group . The red error bars represent using time since a close contact receiving second to the exact date of its index case being isolated to determine fully vaccinated group . ( b ) Distributions of measured serial interval data with the best fit Weibull distribution based on 286 transmission pairs . ( c ) Joint distribution of ORF1ab gene PCR cycle threshold ( Ct ) values and days since symptom onset . ( d ) Same as ( c ) , but for N gene . Figure 2 . Contact matrix of index cases and their close contacts . Each cell of the matrix accounts for the average number of daily contacts produced by a member in each age group with other individuals . The age was categorized to seven groups ( 0 to 9 years , 10 to 19 years , 20 to 29 years , 30 to 39 years , 40 to 49 years , 50 to 59 years , and more than 60 years old ) . Figure 3 . Simulation for Delta and Omicron variant induced daily new infections per 10 , 000 ( 7 - day rolling average ) . Daily new cases per 10 , 000 by seven age groups and four vaccination statuses , with solid lines representing VE against Delta infection at 14 - 30 , 31 - 60 , and > 60 days after full vaccination corresponding to 63 . 49 % , 56 . 00 % and 45 . 96 % , respectively . Dashed lines represent VE against Omicron infection at 14 - 30 , 31 - 60 , and > 60 days after full vaccination corresponding to 0 . 03 % , 0 . 03 % , and 0 . 01 % , respectively . Figure 4 . Reduction of peak daily incidence . The X - axis represents the proportion of reduction compared with no intervention on reducing contact rates . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 26 Figure 5 .
