Its expression is regulated at multiple layers via various mechanisms . It is subject to epigenetic modifications , i . e . DNA methylation and histone acetylation . Hypomethylation and acetylation of the MET gene have been associated with its high expression in some cancers . Multiple transcription factors including Sp1 and Ets - 1 govern its transcription . After its transcription , MET mRNA is spliced into multiple species in the nucleus before being transported to the cytoplasm where its translation is modulated by at least 30 microRNAs and translation initiation factors , e . g . eIF4E and eIF4B . MET mRNA produces a single chain pro - Met protein of 170 kDa which is cleaved into α and β chains . These two chains are bound together through disulfide bonds to form a heterodimer which undergoes either N - linked or O - linked glycosylation in the Golgi apparatus before it is properly localized in the membrane . Upon interactions with its ligand , i . e . hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) , the activity of Met kinase is boosted through various phosphorylation mechanisms and the Met signal is relayed to downstream pathways . The phosphorylated Met is then internalized for subsequent degradation or recycle via proteasome , lysosome or endosome pathways . Moreover , the Met expression is subject to autoregulation and activation by other EGFRs and G - protein coupled receptors . Since deregulation of the MET gene leads to cancer and other pathological conditions , a better understanding of the MET regulation is critical for Met - targeted therapeutics . Introduction Copious evidence has indicated that the MET oncogene plays a causative role in cancer development , i . e . tumor initiation via cancer stem cell formation , tumor progression via cell prolif - eration and survival , drug resistance and metastasis ( 1 ) . For example , the Met protein from primary melanoma cells can be packed into tumor exosomes and delivered to distal organs , i . e . bone marrows and lungs , to prime these organs for future metastases ( 2 ) . In various cancers , MET expression is frequently elevated . Amplification of the MET gene might contribute to this elevated expression in some cases . However , the majority of cancers with high Met protein expression do not have amplification of the gene ( 3 ) . This discordance indicates that regulation of the MET expression is aberrant in these cancers . Mounting evidence has demonstrated that the expression of the MET gene is subject to various layers of regulation , i . e . epigenetic , transcriptional , post - transcriptional regulations . Due to its importance in carcinogenesis and cancer progres - sion , targeting Met has become an attractive strategy in can - cer treatment ( 1 ) . However , Met also displays some antitumor effects in neutrophils ( 4 ) . This complicated biology means that the successful implementation of Met - targeting therapeutics requires a better understanding of this oncogene . We hereby summarize mechanisms by which MET expression is regulated , with an emphasis on advances in recent years . Regulation by epigenetic modifications Epigenetic modifications of the genome , i . e . DNA methyla - tion and histone acetylation or methylation , are essential for regulating gene expression . These modifications change the architectures of the genome and thus alter the accessibility of transcription factors and RNA polymerases to the target genes ( 5 ) .

These enzymes transfer the methyl group from S - adenosyl - methionine to the 5 ′ position of cytosines of CpG islands . Hypermethylation of DNA may recruit some proteins e . g . methyl - CpG binding domain proteins or poly - comb group proteins , to the DNA to initiate genomic silencing . Alternatively , DNA methylation may form a physical hindrance to some transcription factors and thus block transcription ( 6 ) . Methylation of the MET gene plays an indispensable role modulating its expression in some cancers . It has been shown that the MET gene is hypomethylated and thus overexpressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas ( PDAC ) ( 7 ) . Importantly , the hypomethylation status of the MET gene is correlated with low overall survival and disease - free survival ( 7 ) . Of note , MET expression may also be regulated through methylation of L1 ( Long interspersed nuclear element ) , a non - LTR retrotranspon widely scattered in the human genome . A copy of L1 is present in the MET intron between Exon 2 and Exon 3 ( 8 ) . L1 contains an antisense promoter that drives expression of a fusion transcript of MET ( L1 - MET ) . This pro - moter is usually hypermethylated and L1 - MET expression is relatively low . However , when the cells are treated with 5 - aza - 2 ′ - deoxycytidine , a DNA methyltransferases inhibitor used for myeloid leukemia treatment , the MET mRNA expression is approximately 7 - folds higher than the control ( 8 ) . The biological roles for L1 - MET mRNA expression seem controversial , however . In DKO and HCT16 cells , L1 - MET mRNA expression interferes with the normal expression of MET and is inversely correlated with MET mRNA and protein ( 8 ) , while in hepatic cell cancer ( HCC ) tissues , L1 - MET promotes Met activity and is correlated with metastasis ( 9 ) . These results suggest that the biological role of L1 - MET is cellular context dependent . The MET expression may also be regulated indirectly through methylation of its regulators , e . g . FBLN - 3 ( Fibulin - 3 ) , Glutathione peroxidase 3 ( GPx3 ) , Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 ( SOCS1 ) and MYO5B . For example , the MET expression is usually elevated in human sporadic insulinomas but is suppressed by 5 - aza - 2 ′ - deoxycytidine in MIN6 cells . It turns out that in insulinomas , the promoter of the long non - coding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 ( IncRNA Meg3 ) is hypermethylated , silencing the expression of IncRNA Meg3 . Since IncRNA Meg3 inhibits MET expression , this methylation alleviates this inhibition ( 10 ) . These observations may explain why treatment of lung cancer cell lines with 5 - aza - 2 ′ - deoxycytidine inhibits the expression of MET . Histone acetylation Like DNA methylation , histone modifications , i . e . acetylation and methylation , also play an essential role in regulating gene expression . Histone acetylation is catalyzed by histone acetyl - transferases . Acetylation of lysine residues at the N - terminus of histones neutralizes positive charges and thus decreases interactions between histones and DNA , rendering transcrip - tion factors and RNA polymerases more access to the targeted regulatory regions . Histone acetylation is a dynamic process and is constantly counteracted by the action of histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) ( 11 ) . Several studies have demonstrated that MET expression may also be subject to histone modifications . For example , siRNA depletion of HDAC 1 – 3 in several HCC cell lines increases histone acetylation and consequently the abundance of MET mRNA ( 12 ) . Similarly , treatment of MDA - MB - 231 cells with NaBu ( sodium butyrate , a HDAC inhibitor ) leads to an increase of the MET expression ( 13 ) . One possible mechanism for this regulation is through Death - Domain Associated Protein ( Daxx ) which binds to the MET promoter directly . Upon binding , Daxx recruits HDAC2 to the MET promoter and thus represses MET transcription . This scenario is supported by the observation that MET abundance is inversely correlated with Daxx in breast cancer cell lines and metastatic tissues ( 14 ) . Epigenetic regulation of MET expression seems to be depend - ent upon cellular context . For example , in the prostate cancer cell line PC3 and the non - small lung cancer cell line A549 treated with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid ( SAHA ) , an inhibitor of HDACs , Met protein abundance was not affected ( 15 ) . Regulation by transcription factors An analysis of the MET promoter shows that the 300bp fragment upstream of the transcription start site is sufficient to drive the expression of MET . The promoter of the MET gene does not have canonic TATA or CAAT elements . Instead , several Sp1 binding motifs ( G / TGGGCGGG / AG / AC / T ) are required for MET expres - sion , since alterations of these Sp1 motifs largely abolish the MET promoter activity ( 16 , 17 ) . Sp1 , together with PC4 , may also bind to a region approximately 20bp upstream of the transcrip - tion start site ( 18 ) . A SNP ( G > C , rs1858830 ) in this region reduces binding of Sp1 and PC4 , leading to lowered expression of MET in some autism patients ( 18 ) . A recent study reveals that the binding of Sp1 to the MET promoter may be affected by the architecture of the promoter . Between −48 to −26nt of the human MET promoter , a highly GC rich sequence is able to form an intramolecular parallel G - quadruplex in vitro . G - quadruplex is a four - stranded DNA structure and its formation may interfere with transcription factor binding and potentially regulate gene expression ( 19 ) . Evidently , treatment of several cancer cell lines with TMPyP4 , a cationic porphyrin that distorts G - quadruplexes and thus potentially disrupts recruitment of Sp1 to the promoter , reduces the MET expression in these cells ( 20 ) . Next to one of the Sp - 1 binding sites ( −124 ) , an activated protein - 1 ( AP - 1 ) consensus sequence ( TGAGTCA ) is identified at position −158 to −152 . Interestingly , Sp - 1 binding to this site may interfere with AP - 1 binding , probably due to spatial hindrance . It seems that AP - 1 binding to this site is promoted by HGF treat - ment , at least in Hepa 1 – 6 cells ( 21 ) . Upon binding , AP - 1 may enhance MET transcription . This notion is supported by the fact that ectopic expression of basic leucine zipper transcription fac - tor , ATF - like 2 ( BATF2 ) which binds to c - Jun and therefore blocks AP - 1 DNA binding , decreases the MET expression in LoVo and SW620 colorectal cell lines ( 22 ) . The MET promoter also contains six putative Ets - 1 bind - ing sites ( 23 ) . E 26 t ransformation specific s equence 1 ( Ets - 1 ) is a transcription factor belonging to the winged helix - turn - helix ( wHTH ) DNA - binding protein family . Ets - 1 is frequently Abbreviations AP - 1 activated protein - 1 GPCRs G - protein couple receptors HDAC histone deacetylase miRNA microRNA NLS nuclear localization signal RTK receptor tyrosine kinase SAHA suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid UTR untranslated region D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / c a r c i n / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 37 / 4 / 345 / 2365816 b y gue s t on 19 M a r c h 2019 J . Zhang et al . | 347 overexpressed in cancer cells and regarded as a proto - oncogene . For example , Ets - 1 is highly expressed in mouse mammary tumor epithelial cells , correlating with MET overexpression and cell invasion . Ectopic expression of Ets - 1 increases the MET pro - moter activity and abundance ( 24 ) . Conversely , inhibition of Ets - 1 activity by peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor gamma ( PPAR γ ) significantly attenuates the Met expression in MKN - 45 cells ( a human gastric cancer cell line ) ( 25 ) . Interestingly , Ets - 2 , a homolog of Ets - 1 , displays a different role in regulating Met activity while performing similar functions in other biological events ( 26 ) . Knocking down Ets - 2 in H441 lung cancer cells leads to an increase of Met phosphorylation while forced Ets - 2 expres - sion has an opposite effect ( 27 ) . The mechanism for these dis - tinct effects is currently unknown . In epithelial tissues , some of these Ets - 1 sites may also be recognized by Ese - 1 and E pithelial S pecific E ts factor ( Ese - 3 ) . Ese - 3 binds strongly to two of these consensus sites ( −125 and −65 ) and promotes MET transcription , while in HEK293 cells , Ese - 1 and Ese - 3 transactivate MET expression despite the fact that they may compete for the same consensus sites of the MET promoter ( 28 ) . The MET promoter possesses several Pax ( Paired Box gene ) consensus sites and indeed its expression is regulated by the Pax family members , which are a group of highly conserved helix - turn - helix transcription factors . In normal adult tissues , the Pax expression is minimal . However , they are highly abun - dant in various cancer tissues and are strongly correlated with the MET expression . For example , in NSCLC tissues , there is a positive correlation between Pax8 and Met protein . Knockdown of Pax8 in A549 cells reduces the expression of Met protein and lowers cell viability ( 29 ) . Alongside with those transcription factors mentioned above , the MET gene may be regulated by several other transcription factors that can activate or repress its expression , dependent upon cellular context and environment . A good example of envi - ronmental changes modulating the MET expression is hypoxia . The primary transcription factor that regulates MET expression under hypoxia is hypoxia - induced factor 1 ( HIF1 α ) ( 30 , 31 ) , a transcription factor critical for homeostasis under hypoxic con - ditions . The MET promoter has five HIF - 1 α consensus sites ( 5 ′ - RCGTG - 3 ′ ) . At least two of them , within 350 bp downstream of the transcription start site , confer hypoxia - induced Met expres - sion in vitro and in vivo ( 30 ) . Since MET is implicated in tumor invasion and angiogenesis , this regulation may explain why hypoxia promotes metastasis in solid tumors . Notably , MET expression is inhibited by androgen receptor via different mechanisms . Androgen receptor directly com - petes with two distal Sp1 sites and thus inhibits MET transcrip - tion in DU154 cells . Indirectly , androgen receptor mediates the transcription of transmembrane protease serine 2 ( TMPRSS2 ) , an androgen - regulated cell - surface serine protease . TMPRSS2 in turn promotes HGF and Met signaling ( 32 ) . Therefore , these findings may explain why androgen ablation therapy eventually becomes ineffective and why many patients have developed castration - resistant growth and even metastasis . Regulation by alternative splicing The MET gene spans approximately 120 kb on Chromosome 7q21 - 31 and its transcript includes 20 introns and 21 exons . Because of the two alternative splicing sites in exon 10 and exon 14 , MET mRNA is transcribed from a single promoter and spliced to major species of 8k , 7 k , 5 k and 3 k nucleotides long in GTL16 cells ( a human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line ) ( 23 , 33 ) . While the 170 kDa Met is translated from the 8k mRNA , the 7 k species does not generate any protein product , due to skipping of the 1214nt long exon 2 ( 23 , 33 ) . Later studies have identified more MET mRNA species with various lengths . A list of 15 MET mRNA ranging from 1 . 2k to 2 . 6k is available at UCSC database : http : / / genome . ucsc . edu / cgi - bin / hgGene ? hgg _ gene = uc011kmz . 1 & hgg _ prot = B5A933 & hgg _ chrom = chr7 & hgg _ start = 116339124 & hgg _ end = 116364901 & hgg _ type = knownGene & db = hg19 & hgsid = 442320925 _ VVLd0A8iEJuHuuaRA9babrYtvug6 . The importance of proper splicing of MET mRNA has been demonstrated in various studies . For example , in some high - grade gliomas , MET mRNA contains a deletion , in which exons 7 and 8 were skipped . This mRNA is translated to a protein miss - ing extracellular IPT domain . Dubbed Met Δ 7 – 8 , this truncated protein primarily localizes in the cytosol and is constitutively active ( 34 ) . Another example is Δ 13Met , which is an alternatively spliced version of MET mRNA without exon 13 . The Δ 13Met protein prod - uct possesses only the extracellular domain and is commonly found in human skeletal muscle . Upon binding to HGF , this trun - cated version fails to transduce the signal to downstream and is thus inhibitory to Met function ( 35 ) . Consistently , forced expres - sion of the Δ 13Met mutant represses the downstream events , i . e . Met and ERK phosphorylation ( 35 ) . In contrast , skipping exon 14 leads to the accumulation of Met protein ( METex14 ) since this mutation loses Y1003 , which is critical for Met ubiquitination and degradation by proteasomes demonstrated in various stud - ies ( 36 ) . This cancer driver mutation ( METex14 ) has been identi - fied in a subset of patients of lung and brain cancers ( 37 ) . The mechanism governing MET mRNA splicing is not clear . It is possible that miniature chromosome maintenance 7 ( MCM7 ) plays a role in this process . MCM7 is also aberrantly expressed in multiple cancers and critical for DNA replication . In PC3 and DU145 cells , depletion of MCM7 with siRNA increases the unspliced MET mRNA . Although the exact mechanisms are still unknown , interaction of MCM7 with SF3B3 ( splicing factor 3B , subunit 3 ) may be involved in regulating MET mRNA splicing , since depletion of SF3B3 alters MET mRNA splicing ( 38 ) . Regulation by microRNAs MET translation is also regulated by more than 30 microRNAs ( miRNAs ) through various mechanisms ( 39 ) . miRNAs are a group of non - coding RNAs of 21 – 25 nucleotides long that usu - ally regulate gene expression through their specific binding to the 3 ′ - untranslated regions ( UTRs ) of their target mRNAs . Their binding accelerates the degradation of target mRNAs or inhib - its translation of their targets . It has been well established that aberrant expression of miRNAs is implicated in various diseases including cancers ( 40 ) . One such example is miR - 1 that inhibits MET expression through various mechanisms . In the majority of colon cancer , lung cancer and primary HCCs , miR - 1 expression is inversely cor - related with the MET expression ( 41 – 44 ) . miR - 1 is usually methyl - ated and its expression silenced in HCCs . miR - 1 is encoded by of the intron 1 of the putative ORF166 and able to bind three con - sensus sites on the 3 ′ - UTR of MET mRNA and inhibits its expres - sion ( 44 ) . Additionally , miR - 1 may also regulate MET expression indirectly through inhibiting MACC1 and ETS - 1 , two transcrip - tion factors responsible for MET transcription ( 42 ) . Consistently , ectopic expression of miR - 1 in colon cancer cells and HCC cells reduces Met abundance and thus cell invasion ( 42 , 44 ) . miR - 139 - 5p is also a tumor suppressor and frequently lost in primary lung cancer tissues . Ectopic expression of this miRNA D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / c a r c i n / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 37 / 4 / 345 / 2365816 b y gue s t on 19 M a r c h 2019 348 | Carcinogenesis , 2016 , Vol . 37 , No . 4 in lung cancer cell lines , e . g . A549 and SKMES - 1 , represses cell proliferation and migration , which are dependent upon MET expression . There is a strong inverse correlation between miR - 139 - 5p and MET expression . The 3 ′ - UTR of MET mRNA has one consensus miR - 139 - 5p binding site that confers its inhibitory effect . Indeed , ectopic expression of miR - 139 - 5p significantly inhibits the luciferase reporter harboring the MET 3 ′ - UTR . Mutation in the seed sequence of the miR - 139 - 5p consensus site abolishes this inhibition , indicating a direct interaction of miR - 139 - 5p with this binding site ( 45 ) . Likewise , miR - 206 is abundant in skeletal muscle and its expression is lost in rhab - domyosarcomas as well as a rhabdomyosarcoma RD cell line . Not surprisingly , restoration of miR - 206 in RD cells decreases cell proliferation and migration , due to an inhibition of the MET expression by miR - 206 , conferred through the two miR - 206 binding sites at the 3 ′ - UTR of MET mRNA ( 46 ) . Similar examples have also been reported in miR - 181a - 5p in HCC ( 47 ) and miR - 7515 in lung cancer ( 48 ) . Conversely , MET may also modulate expression of some miR - NAs . For examples , a cluster of 23 miRNAs , e . g . miR - 127 , miR - 154 and miR - 431 , is upregulated in tumors isolated from the liver of the MET transgenic mice ( 49 ) , suggesting an inhibitory effect of MET on the expression of these miRNAs . On the contrary , MET may also promote the expression of miR - 221 and 222 through activation of JNK / AP - 1 pathway ( 50 ) , in various NSCLC and HCC cell lines . Since MET itself is also a target of AP - 1 ( 21 ) , this finding represents a complicated interactive signaling network . Currently , it has been reported that MET expression can be modulated by more than 30 miRNAs ( 39 ) . This list of miRNA reg - ulators is very likely expanding . Importantly , given the impor - tance of miRNAs in regulating expression of oncogenes like MET , some miRNAs may be potentially used for diagnostic biomark - ers or therapeutic purposes . For examples , direct injection of miR - 139 - 5p into the xenografts derived from A549 cells leads to substantial reduction in tumor growth in nude mice ( 45 ) . Regulation by protein translation Translational regulation of oncogenes plays an important role in carcinogenesis ( 51 ) . Emerging evidence indicates that MET expression may also be regulated at the translation level . A criti - cal protein for translation initiation is eIF4E which binds to the 5 ′ m7 G cap of mRNA molecules and thus facilitates ribosomal recruitment ( 52 ) . In HCC822 cells , due to the elevated expression of eIF4E , these cells become erlotinib resistant . Further analysis indicates that aberrant expression of eIF4E causes upregulation of Met and thus confers this erlotinib resistance ( 53 ) . In various cancer cell lines , it has been demonstrated that Pim - 1 kinase positively regulates Met translation . Pim - 1 is a PIM family Ser / Thr kinase which phosphorylates S406 of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4B ( eIF4B ) . This phosphorylation facilitates the interaction between eIF4B and eIF3 to initiate translation ( 54 ) . In addition , Met translation seems to be par - ticularly important under anchorage independent growth con - dition , under which global mRNA translation is down - regulated but MET mRNA is preferentially recruited to the polysomes to increase its translation through unknown mechanisms ( 55 ) . Since anchorage independent growth is strongly correlated with tumorigenicity and invasiveness in vivo ( 56 ) , this cap - dependent Met translation provides a novel insight on cancer metastasis . Regulation by proteolysis The Met protein is first synthesized as pro - Met , a single chain precursor of 170 kDa . The pro - Met undergoes extensive posttranslational modifications , e . g . glycosylation and prote - olysis , to become a functionally mature protein ( 57 ) . This pre - cursor protein is cleaved into a 50 kDa α - subunit and a 145 kDa β - subunit , which form a heterodimer through disulfide bonds . After glycosylation , this heterodimer becomes a mature protein with a molecular weight of 190 kDa ( 57 ) . However , the cleavage of the 170 kDa pro - Met protein may not be essential for its activity , since the uncleaved pro - Met is still glycosylated and constitu - tively active . Importantly , the presence of this uncleaved form in some HCC cases suggests a potential role in carcinogenesis ( 58 ) . Another type of Met proteolysis is commonly referred to as ‘ectodomain shedding’ , in which the extracellular domain is cleaved from the cell membrane through actions of various matrix metalloproteinase and A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase Domain ( ADAM ) family members , e . g . TIMP - 3 sensitive metal - loproteinase , ADAM10 and ADAM17 ( 59 ) . The shed product may function as a decoy receptor to block HGF activity and the abun - dance of the shed fraction correlated with tumor progression and may thus be used a biomarker in body fluids ( 59 ) . Regulation by glycosylation Glycosylation is essential for maturation and functions of mem - brane proteins , i . e . receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) , regulating their routing , conformation and ligand binding ( 60 ) . For exam - ple , inhibition of glycosylation sensitizes cancer cells that are resistant to EGFR targeted therapy to radiation ( 60 ) . The most common modification for RTKs is N - linked glycosyla - tion , in which an oligosaccharide is transferred to an asparagine residue ( 60 ) . There are 11 putative sites for N - glycosylation in the Met protein ( 57 ) . When digested with neuraminidase and endogly - cosidase F , two enzymes to hydrolyze N - linked oligosaccharides , the migration pattern of the Met protein is shifted on a SDS - PAGE gel , confirming that the Met protein is N - glycosylated ( 57 ) . In some other cell types , the glycosylation of the Met protein can also be O - linked . This type of glycosylation involves transfer - ring glycans to the hydroxyl group of a serine or threonine resi - due . In HCC cell lines HA22T and PLC5 , modification of Met with O - glycans is mediated through C1GALT1 ( Core 1 b1 , 3 - galactosyl - transferase ) , a mucin - type O - glycosyltransferase . Depletion of G1GALT1 by siRNA decreases phosphorylation and dimerization of Met , leading to inhibition of cell migration and invasion ( 61 ) . Also in HCT116 cells , depletion of β - galactoside α 2 , 6 - sialyltransferase ( ST6Gal - I ) leads to reduced α 2 , 6 - sialylation of the Met protein . This decreases the expression of the mature β - subunit peptide but not MET mRNA , suggesting that α 2 , 6 - sialylation may be important for the proper cleavage of the pro - Met and thus its function ( 62 ) . Several lines of evidence have shown that the Met glycosyla - tion is essentially for its functions . First , treatment of GTL - 16 cells with tunicamycin blocked the Met glycosylation . As a result , the Met protein without glycosylation could not be properly cleaved and phosphorylated in vivo ( 57 ) . Second , tunicamycin treatment of MHCC - 97H ( human HCC cell line ) and RBE ( human cholangiocarcinoma cell line ) leads to the cytoplasmic retention of the Met protein . Third , tunicamycin treatment accelerates the degradation of the Met protein by proteasomes ( 63 ) . Fourth , inhi - bition of glycosylation attenuates the Met signaling ( 61 , 62 ) . Last , N - glycosylation is critical for the conformation , orientation and dimerization of EGFRs on the membrane ( 64 , 65 ) . Regulation by phosphorylation Like other RTKs , phosphorylation plays an essential role gov - erning the activity and the fate of Met . Upon HGF binding , Met D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / c a r c i n / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 37 / 4 / 345 / 2365816 b y gue s t on 19 M a r c h 2019 J . Zhang et al . | 349 undergoes dimerization and Y1234 / Y1235 autophosphorylation , which stimulates its kinase activity . Subsequently , two adjacent residues ( Y1349 and Y1356 ) are also phosphorylated , resulting in generation of a dock site for signal transduction ( 66 ) . Met may also be phosphorylated by other kinases . A major kinase to phosphorylate Met is Src , a non - RTK . When an acti - vated Src is expressed in HC11 , a non - neoplastic breast epithelial cell line , Met phosphorylation at Y1230 , 1234 and 1235 is ele - vated . Conversely , expression of a dominant negative Src ( kinase dead ) or treatment with PD180970 ( Src inhibitor ) abolishes the constitutive Met phosphorylation in SP1 breast cancer cell line ( 67 ) . In some cells , Src - dependent phosphorylation requires cell - matrix adhesion and FAK ( 67 ) . Protein kinase C family also plays a critical role in Met phosphorylation to adapt to environmental changes . For example , PKC α - mediated Y1003 phosphorylation upon LPS ( lipopolysaccharide ) treatment , leading to the inter - nalization of Met and lung epithelial barrier dysfunction ( 68 ) , while treatment with H 2 O 2 or TPA ( 12 - O - tetradecanoylphorbol - 13 - acetate ) decreases tyrosine phosphorylation but promotes phosphorylation of S985 by PKC δ / ε ( 69 ) . Meanwhile , the phosphorylation status of Met is also deter - mined by the activity of phosphatases , i . e . PP2A , DEP - 1 , SHP2 and PTP - 1B . Density - enhanced phosphatase 1 ( DEP - 1 ) is a receptor tyrosine phosphatase that dephosphorylates Met Y1349 and Y1365 , which are important for Gab1 binding and morphogenesis ( 70 ) . For example , Leukocyte cell - derived chem - otaxin 2 ( LECT2 ) interacts with the Met α - chain ( aa 159 – 175 ) directly through its HxGxD Motif . This interaction recruits the protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B ( PTP - 1B ) . Dephosphorylation of the Met protein by PTP - 1B triggers the dissociation of adap - tors proteins , e . g . Gab1 and Src , leading to attenuation of the Met signaling ( 71 ) . Regulation by internalization and degradation Upon HGF binding , Met is internalized and sorted to endosomes through endocytosis which is clathrin - and dynamin - depend - ent . The mechanisms have been reviewed elsewhere ( 72 ) . From endosomes , Met can either be recycled back to the membrane or delivered to lysosomes for degradation . Recent studies indi - cate that PKC is critical in this process since depletion of PKC ε blocked the Met degradation in HCC cell ( 73 ) . Met is also subject to ubiquitin - mediated proteasome deg - radation . Met degradation by proteasomes has been well demonstrated in various studies ( 74 ) . A critical player is Cbl ( Castias B - lineage lymphoma ) , an E3 ubiquitin ligase respon - sible for Met ubiquitination and degradation by proteasomes ( 36 ) . Phosphorylation of Met at Y1003 creates a docking site for recruiting Cbl directly through an atypical DpYR motif in the juxtamembrane domain of Met ( 74 ) . Alternatively , Cbl may be recruited to Met through its interaction with the adaptor protein Grb2 ( 74 ) . Evidently , Tpr - Met , a fusion protein found in various cancers , loses Cbl binding region in the juxtamembrane domain of Met and thus escapes protein degradation ( 74 ) . Similarly , Socs1 ( Suppressors of Cytokine Signaling ) pro - motes degradation of RTKs , including Met . Socs1 is frequently repressed in human HCC and regarded as a tumor suppressor . The SH2 domain of Socs1 binds to the Met protein while its Socs box recruits the E3 ubiquitin machinery , leading to protea - some - dependent degradation . Moreover , Socs1 - mediated Met degradation is not lysosome dependent , since bafilomycin and chloroquine , inhibitors of lysosomes , fail to block the Met degra - dation . Consistently , overexpression of Socs1 decreases the Met phosphorylation and thus attenuates the Met signaling in liver . Interestingly , modifications of lysines , e . g . K48 - linked polyubiq - uitination , are required for Socs1 - mediated degradation ( 75 ) . In contrast to Y1003 , Y1313 phosphorylation plays role sta - bilizing the Met protein . This phosphorylation enables TNS4 ( Tensin 4 ) binding to Met through its SH2 - domain . Upon bind - ing , TNS4 inhibits the Met internalization to lysosomes . There is a strong correlation between TNS4 and the Met expression in colon and ovarian cancers ( 76 ) . Regulation by nuclear localization Similar to other EGFRs , the Met protein activates downstream signaling pathways in the cytoplasm . However , recent evident also indicates that the Met protein may translocate to the nucleus . For example , Met is localized in the nuclei of some breast cancer cases and cancer cell lines ( 77 , 78 ) . This nuclear Met is a 60 - kDa fragment cleaved from its C - terminus . The mechanism ( s ) for generating this nuclear fragment are not clear . Possibly , Met is processed sequentially by ADAM 10 and 17 to generate N - terminal fragment and a membrane - anchored C - terminal fragment ( shedding ) . This C - terminal fragment is further cleaved by γ - secretase ( 79 ) . The nuclear presence of Met was at first puzzling since the Met protein does not have any canonical nuclear localization signal ( NLSs ) . Serial truncations have identified that the Met jux - tamembrane domain is critical for its nuclear localization ( 77 , 78 ) . Indeed , a putative bipartite NLS ( H VVIGPSSLIV H ) at aa1068 – 1079 of the juxtamembrane domain plays a critical role in the Met nuclear localization . The two flanking histidines are essential for the NLS function since the mutation of either one to alanine abolishes the Met nuclear localization due to decreased binding with importin β , which , together with Gab1 , is required for the Met nuclear localization ( 80 ) . Very interestingly , this NLS serves as a pH sensor since lowered cellular pH increases the Met bind - ing to importin β and thus the nuclear localization ( 81 ) . The biological roles for the Met nuclear localization remain elusive . However , it is reported that the nuclear Met regulates calcium signaling via activating PLC - γ ( phospholipase C ) and forming InsP3 ( 1 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate ) in the nucleus ( 80 ) . In addi - tion , transcriptional activation has been reported in other RTKs . For example , EGFR is able to relocate to the nucleus and pro - motes transcription of Cyclin D1 in MCF10A cells ( 82 ) . It is likely that the Met protein is also involved in gene transcription since Met displays transactivation activity when fused with Gal4 DNA - binding domain ( 78 ) . The exact transcriptional targets of the nuclear Met require further investigation . The nuclear presence of the 60 kDa Met is correlated with tumor malignancy . This protein presents in MDA - MB231 , an inva - sive breast cancer cell line but not in MCF - 7 , a non - metastatic cell line ( 78 ) . This differential expression pattern of the 60 kDa nuclear Met may be dependent upon the presence of Wwox ( WW domain - containing oxidoreductase ) , a putative tumor suppressor gene . MDA - MB231 expresses low Wwox while MCF - 7 has an opposite pattern . Indeed , ectopic expression of Wwox in MDA - MB231 cells prevents the Met nuclear accumulation , which leads to decreased migration of the cells , indicating that the Met nuclear localization may be implicated in metastasis / invasiveness ( 78 ) . The nuclear localization of the Met protein is cell type specific . For example , the 60 kDa fragment translocates to the nucleus in HeLa cells but not Chang Liver cells ( 81 ) . Additionally , Met migrates to the nucleus upon HGF stimulation in SKHep1 cells ( 80 ) whereas in MDA - MB231 cells , its nuclear localization is constitutive ( 78 ) .

EGFR and G - protein couple receptors ( GPCRs ) . Importantly , the Met signal - ing pathway can also be activated by other EGFRs and by GPCRs through a process called ‘transactivation’ ( 83 , 84 ) . The cross - talk between GPCRs and Met , as well as other RTKs , reveals a com - plicated interaction and coordination among different signaling pathways upon external stimuli . One such mechanism is through heterodimerization and trans - phosphorylation with other RTKs . It has been shown that in COS cells , RON ( Recepteur d’Origine Nantais ) kinase , a Met related RTK , forms heterodimers with Met upon stimula - tion with either of their ligands , i . e . HGF or Scatter Factor 2 , and mutually phosphorylates each other ( 85 ) . In addition to GPCRs and EGFRs , the Met signaling pathway may also be activated through interactions with other cell surface molecules , e . g . plex - ins , CD44 and tetraspanin ( 86 ) . Interestingly , these molecules are involved in exosome secretion ( 87 ) , which is important for Met - mediated metastasis ( 2 ) . The interactions between Met and other cell surface molecules have been reviewed elsewhere ( 86 ) . Met activation by surface molecules is different from EGFR activation , at least in gastric cancer cells . In MKN28 and MKN74 , two human gastric cancer cell lines , S1P ( Sphingosine 1 - phos - phate ) transactivates both EGFR and Met through GPCRs ( 84 ) . However , they are activated through different mechanisms . For example , G i protein and matrix metalloproteinase are required for the activation of EGFR but not for the Met receptor ( 84 ) . Moreover , Met transactivation may be dependent upon EGFR activity in response to some external signals , e . g . prostaglandin E2 , in colon cancer cells ( 88 ) but not in HCC cells in response to LPA treatment ( 83 ) . This result suggests that Met transactivation is dependent upon the cellular context and the nature of exter - nal stimulus . Regulation by p53 The fact that MET expression is regulated by p53 was first dem - onstrated by Rong et al . Their study indicated that MET is highly expressed in sarcomas from patients of Li - Fraumeni syndrome and p53 - deficient mice ( 89 ) . Later , several groups have illustrated that p53 regulates the MET expression via various mechanisms . First , p53 may inhibit Sp1 - mediated transcription of MET . p53 physically interacts with Sp1 and thus reduces its binding to the MET promoter in SKOV - 3 and OVCA433 cells ( 90 ) . However , under certain circumstances , p53 may also promote the MET transcrip - tion . At position −278 to −216 of the MET promoter , there is a p53 responsive element which confers p53 transactivation activity in response to UV irradiation in RKO cells ( 91 ) . This transcrip - tional regulation may be cell type / stimulation dependent , since activation of p53 in HCT116 cells does not promote the MET expression ( 92 ) . Second , p53 inhibits translation of MET mRNA via miR - 34 which is frequently lost in various cancers ( 93 – 97 ) . In HCC tis - sues , there is a strong inverse correlation between miR - 34a and Met abundance . It has been shown that miR - 34a directly binds to the 3’ - UTR of MET mRNA and inhibits its translation , while this miRNA itself is a target transcriptionally activated p53 ( 97 , 98 ) . Third , p53 may also regulate Met receptor activity post - translationally , since mutation of p53 ( R175H ) seems to promote Met phosphorylation and kinase activity . A common p53 muta - tion ( R175H ) activates the Met RTK to enhance tumor cell inva - sion . R175H , as well as another common mutation 273H , may enhance recycling of the Met receptor to the cell surface and thus promote its activity and invasive behavior of the cell ( 99 ) . Similarly , ectopic expression of the mouse equivalent p53 muta - tion of R175H or R273H ( R163H or R261H in mouse ) , promotes Met protein abundance in MDCK ( Madin - Darby canine kidney ) cells ( 100 ) . Autoregulation In addition to being regulated by the aforementioned mecha - nisms , the Met pathway may also induce itself through various mechanisms . First , activation of the Met kinase can be inter - molecularly autocatalytic ( 101 ) since the Met receptor interacts with other receptor species to promote receptor clustering ( 102 ) . Second , the Met signal upregulates transcription factors , e . g . ETS1 ( 103 ) , MACC1 ( 42 ) and HIF - 1 ( 104 ) , providing a positive feed - back on its own transcriptional . Third , Met may downregulate some miRNAs , e . g . miR - 1 to de - repress their inhibitory effects on Met ( 42 ) . Fourth , the Met pathway also represses its degra - dation through downregulating Cbl protein and Socs1 ( 105 , 106 ) . Fifth , the Met signaling promotes ROS production , which in turn , promotes Met phosphorylation ( 107 ) . This ramification system may significantly enhance the downstream signaling pathways even with moderate increase of Met abundance . Mutations enhancing Met activity Various mutations of the MET genes have been identified in can - cer patients . Some mutations may be cancer drivers given that these mutations significantly enhance Met activity via different mechanisms as discussed below . 1 . Constitutive phosphorylation of the Met receptor Activating MET mutations are frequently observed in sporadic papillary renal cell carcinomas ( 13 % ) ( 108 ) . Mutations H1112L , H1124D and Y1248D lead to constitutive phosphorylation of the Met receptor . When ectopically expressed in NIH3T3 cells , these mutated receptors significantly promote focus formation , an in vitro assay determining oncogenic potentials of genes ( 108 ) . Tyrosine 1235 ( Y1235 ) is one of the two autophosphoryla - tion sites ( Y1234 and Y1235 ) for activation of the Met receptor kinase . Y1235D mutation results in the replacement of tyrosine 1235 with negatively charged aspartic acid which mimics con - stitutive phosphorylation . This mutation is highly enriched in the metastatic but not primary head and neck squamous car - cinomas ( 109 ) . 2 . Reduced protein degradation As previously mentioned , skipping exon 14 leads to the loss of the juxtamembrane Cbl binding site and thus reduces ubiqui - tination / degradation of the Met protein ( 36 ) . Interestingly , a recent study shows that in pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinomas , there is a high frequency ( 22 % , 8 / 36 ) of this mutation ( 110 ) . A different mutation leads to the stabilization of the Met protein via a similar mechanism . The substitution of Y1003 with phenylalanine ( Y1003F ) or substitution of neighboring aspartate or arginine residue with alanine ( D1002A or R1004A ) impairs recruitment of Cbl to the Met receptor and thus decreases its ubiquitination and degradation ( 111 ) . 3 . Promoting kinase activity The typical mutation of the MET gene is TPR - MET , in which TPR ( translocated promoter region ) fuses with the region coding the Met kinase domain and C - terminus , generated by exposing a human osteogenic sarcoma cell line ( HOS ) with the carcinogen D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / c a r c i n / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 37 / 4 / 345 / 2365816 b y gue s t on 19 M a r c h 2019 J . Zhang et al . | 351 N - methyl - N’ - nitronitrosoguanidine ( 112 ) . The fusion protein localizes in the cytoplasm due to the lack of the extracellular , transmembrane and juxtamembrane domains so . The presence of the Tpr leucine zipper promotes homodimerization of this mutated Met , leading to the constitutively activated Met recep - tor kinase even in the absence of the ligand , i . e . HGF ( 112 , 113 ) . Similar mutations have been identified in clinical samples . For example , BAIAP2L1 ( BAI1 - associated protein 2 - like 1 ) or C8orf34 ( Chromosome 8 Open Reading Frame 34 ) translocates to and fuses with the MET gene in - frame in some patients with pap - illary renal carcinoma . BAIAP2L1 - MET and C8orf34 - MET encode proteins with motifs that facilitate dimerization of the fusion proteins and thus promote the Met activity ( 114 ) . The V1110I mutation has been identified in multiple papil - lary renal - cell carcinomas . This mutation causes a change of the valine to an isoleucine in the well conserved ATP - binding pocket of the Met receptor , enhancing its kinase activity ( 115 ) . Another example is the M1268T mutation , which is similar to RET ( Receptor Tyrosine Protein Kinase ) M918T mutation that leads to multiple endocrine neoplasia ( 116 , 117 ) . Indeed , this mutation is very potent at transforming cells and the result - ing xenografts grow much larger than other mutations tested , e . g . D1246H or D1246N . It is postulated that the M1268T muta - tion causes changes within the COOH - terminal lobe of the Met kinase domain . This change somehow alleviates inhibition on the Met kinase activity ( 117 ) . Another type of the MET mutation promotes Met receptor activity via a distinct mechanism . The T1010I mutation is also within the Met tyrosine kinase domain . However , it may primar - ily block S985 phosphorylation that is inhibitory to Met activity . The presence of this type of mutation is correlated with metas - tasis ( 118 , 119 ) . 4 . Change in Met receptor recycling A rare mutation P1009S has been identified from gastric cancer ( 120 ) . In contrast to other mutations , P1009S is not constitutively active but its phosphorylation status persists much longer than wild type Met . It is possible that Met receptor recycling / degrada - tion is defective in this mutation . However , the exact mecha - nism remains elusive ( 120 ) . Very interestingly , different mutations may possess dis - tinct properties to activate downstream events . For example , the M1250T and D1228H mutations primarily activate the Ras pathway and promote transformation , while the L1195V and Y1230C mutation are primarily anti - apoptotic via activation of PI3K pathway . The mechanisms for these differential outcomes are not clear ( 121 ) . Summary and perspectives MET is tightly regulated at every layer of the regulating net - work , from epigenetic regulation to its protein degradation ( Summarized in Figure 1 ) . Regulation of MET is also complicated , since different regulatory mechanisms may be interwoven . For example , the miR - 34 promoter is hypermethylated in almost half the CRC cases , leading to down regulation of miR - 34 . Since miR - 34 inhibits MET expression , the hypermethylation silences the miR - 34 expression and thus indirectly promotes the MET expression ( 94 ) . Similarly , miR - 1 is preferentially hypermeth - ylated in HCC tissues in comparison with their normal coun - terparts . Treatment of different HCC cells with 5’ - aza restores miR - 1 expression and thus reduces the MET expression ( 44 ) . Given the fact that Met is an attractive drug target for vari - ous cancers , understanding the regulation of MET is critical for targeting this oncogene in cancer therapeutics , as inappropri - ate approaches may accelerate Met - mediated drug resistance and cancer relapse . For example , Sorafenib is a commonly used TKI inhibitor . Treatment of cells with Sorafenib may increase Met activity , since Sorafenib inhibits DEP - 1 phosphatase activity which dephosphorylates Met Y1349 ( 122 ) . Similarly , treatment of human lung cancer cell line H1993 and NIH3T3 cells with SU11274 and PHA665752 , two known Met inhibitors , leads to Met accumulation , because the treatment abolishes Y1003 phospho - rylation and subsequent ubiquitination ( 123 ) . A recent study reveals that MET may also be of anti - tumor activity in neutrophils ( 4 ) . MET is required for neutrophil infiltra - tion to tumors since deletion of MET on neutrophils promoted tumor progression and compromised the efficacy of anti - Met treatment . This new finding suggests that a better tactic should be designed to target Met on tumor cells but not on neutrophils to achieve maximum therapeutic effects ( 4 ) . Figure 1 . Simplified scheme of regulation of MET . 1 . MET expression is affected by the status of DNA methylation and histone acetylation / methylation , which are modulated by DNA methyltransferases ( DNMT ) and histone ( de ) acetylases ( HATs or HDACs ) , respectively . 2 . Multiple transcription factors , e . g . Sp - 1 and AP - 1 , modulate transcription of MET gene . 3 . Once transcribed , MET mRNA is subject to alternative splicing , resulting in mature mRNAs of various lengths . 4 . In the cytoplasm , the 3’ - UTR of MET mRNA is recognized by dozens of micro - RNAs , e . g . miR - 1 and miR - 34 , leading to inhibition of MET mRNA translation . 5 . Translation of MET mRNA may also be regulated at translation initiation step , in which eIF4B / E and eIF3 are involved . 6 . MET mRNA is translated to a 170kDa pro - protein which is subsequently cleaved into α and β submits . These two subunits dimerize through disulfide bonds to form a 190kDa mature protein . 7 . In the Golgi apparatus , the Met protein undergoes multiple N - linked and O - linked gly - cosylation before translocating to the cell membrane . 8 . Upon ligand binding , the Met receptor kinase is activated auto - phosphorylation or phosphorylation by other kinases , e . g . Src and EGFR , while counteracted by phosphatases like PTP - 1 . 9 . The Met receptor is desensitized via internalization followed by either receptor recycling through endosomes or ubiquitin - mediated proteasome deg - radation .

As aforementioned , Met Δ 7 – 8 is a truncated but active kinase without extracellular domains ( 34 ) for which cur - rent anti - Met antibodies is not effective . Therefore , it would be beneficial for patients with this mutation to be screened out to avoid unnecessary exposure to anti - Met antibody treatment . Conversely , screening for METex14 mutation in patients with lung cancer may be beneficial in Met - targeted therapy , since a recent study has shown that creation of METex14 mutation in HEK293 cells with CRISPR ( Clustered regularly - interspaced short palindromic repeats ) technology sensitizes the cells to crizotinib treatment ( 124 ) . Given the fact that some of the MET mutations are drivers for carcinogenesis , as discussed previously , CRISPR technology , may be used to correct these genetic defects with its awesome power in genome editing ( 124 ) . Other biomarkers should also be considered when screening patients for Met targeted therapeutics . For example , anti - Met treatment with SU11274 induced apoptosis and this effect was dependent on the presence of wild - type p53 gene status in lung cancer ( 125 ) . Likewise , Met amplification promotes development of TNBC ( triple negative breast cancer ) , synergistically with the loss of p53 ( 126 ) . These data suggest that screening wild type p53 patients may potentiate Met - targeting therapeutics in these cancers . DNA methylation has been implicated in carcinogenesis and targeting DNA methylation is considered a tactic for can - cer treatment . SAHA ( ZOLINZA® , Merck ) is currently used for the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) . Some evi - dence has shown that SAHA enhances the Met signal which leads to the resistance to SAHA . This finding suggests that a combination of SAHA together with Met inhibitors would be more effective in the treatment CTCL and possibly other can - cers ( 15 ) . Furthermore , Met may also regulate expression of other genes through epigenetic mechanisms . Activation of Met stabilizes a complex between Ets - 2 and MLL ( mixed - lineage leukemia ) which specifically methylate histone H3 on lysine 4 ( H3K4 ) in HCC cell lines . This methylation facilitates transcrip - tion of MMP1 and MMP3 genes , which are critical for cancer metastasis ( 127 ) . Some novel strategies may also be considered target - ing the Met signaling . For example , FasL interacts with Met directly and stimulates Met phosphorylation and activity . Blocking this interaction with a specific peptide significantly down - regulates the Met signaling . Thus , small molecules or peptides disrupting this interaction may be an intrigu - ing therapeutic tool ( 128 ) . Moreover , caspases cleave Met at D1000 and D1374 sites in the juxtamembrane region , creat - ing a pro - apoptotic fragment of 40 kDa from its C - terminus ( 79 ) . If this phenomenon is harnessed , a therapy may provide double effects : destroying Met and accelerating apoptosis in cancer cells . Solid evidence has indicated that Met is an ideal drug tar - get in cancer therapeutics . Currently , there are 122 clinical tri - als of various phases targeting this oncogene ( c - Met ) registered at www . clinicaltrials . gov . These drugs may be roughly classified into several types , based on their mechanism of action . There are selective Met kinase inhibitors , e . g . ARQ197 , or nonselective ones , e . g . COMETRIQ® ( cabozantinib ) . Alternatively , some anti - c - MET monoclonal antibodies , e . g . Onartuzumab , bind to the Met receptor specifically and promote its internalization and degradation ( 129 ) . Some Met - targeting drugs have displayed promising results in early clinical trials . For example , Onartuzumab , a . k . a . MetMAb developed by Genentech , is a Met specific monoclonal antibody , which prevents HGF from binding to Met receptor and thus blocks the downstream signals . In a Phase II clinical trial in NSCLC patients with positive Met , treatment with both erlotinib and onartuzumab provided better overall survival ( OS ) than that with erlotinib alone ( 12 . 6 versus 3 . 8 months ) ( 130 ) . Among these drugs , Cabozantinib has been approved for the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer in the USA in 2012 . The results of some early clinical trials have been reviewed elsewhere ( 129 , 131 ) . The MET oncogene was discovered more than 30 years ago ( 1 ) , but its regulation mechanisms are still being dissected . Aberrant expression of MET is implicated in tumor initiation , progression , drug resistance and metastasis . Thus , a better understanding of its regulatory mechanisms and downstream events will poten - tially assist to design novel strategies to reduce Met - mediated drug resistance and relapse .
