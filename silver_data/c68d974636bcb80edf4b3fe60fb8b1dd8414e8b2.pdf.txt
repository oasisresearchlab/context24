Heyn , PhD Abstract Background and Objectives : Social robots may promote the health of older adults by increasing their perceived emotional support and social interaction . This review aims to summarize the effectiveness of social robots on outcomes ( psychological , physiological , quality of life , or medications ) of older adults from randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) . Research Design and Methods : A mixed - method systematic review of RCTs meeting the study inclusion criteria was under - taken . Eight databases were electronically searched up to September 2017 . Participants’ characteristics , intervention fea - tures , and outcome data were retrieved . The mean difference and standardized mean difference with 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) were synthesized to pool the effect size . Results : A total of 13 articles from 11 RCTs were identified from 2 , 204 articles , of which 9 studies were included in the meta - analysis . Risk of bias was relatively high in allocation concealment and blinding . Social robots appeared to have positive impacts on agitation , anxiety , and quality of life for older adults but no statistical significance was found in the meta - analysis . However , results from a narrative review indicated that social robot interactions could improve engagement , interaction , and stress indicators , as well as reduce loneliness and the use of medications for older adults . Discussion and Implications : Social robots appear to have the potential to improve the well - being of older adults , but conclusions are limited due to the lack of high - quality studies . More RCTs are recommended with larger sample sizes and rigorous study designs . Keywords : Analysis—systematic review , Socially assistive robots , Technology , Well - being Mental health is a major problem to maintain in older adults , especially in people with dementia . Behavioral and psychological symptoms in people with dementia ( BPSD ) such as agitation , depression , and anxiety , are highly preva - lent among people with dementia , with an estimation of prevalence up to 80 % ( Pieper et al . , 2013 ) . People with these conditions are commonly prescribed antipsychotic medications , which are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events ( Stoner , 2017 ) and even death ( Gill et al . , 2007 ) . Therefore , viable nonpharmacological approaches are recommended as the primary alternative to manage BPSD while avoiding undesirable adverse effects . Over the last decade , the value of human – animal inter - vention ( HAI ) has been widely acknowledged with research showing that interaction with a live animal can improve human health ( Beetz , Uvnäs - Moberg , Julius , & Kotrschal , 2012 ) . Although many individuals may enjoy the opportu - nity to interact with a live animal , this can be difficult to The Gerontologist cite as : Gerontologist , 2019 , Vol . 59 , No . 1 , e37 – e51 doi : 10 . 1093 / geront / gny046 Advance Access publication June 12 , 2018 implement within long - term care ( LTC ) . Dogs , for example , usually have one master and they ( a ) can become stressed when attention is given by numerous residents ; ( b ) may be overfed by zealous residents ; and ( c ) animals can take care staff away from their care of residents ( Moyle et al . , 2013 ) . Live animals also present issues of hygiene and some residents can experience allergic responses , have a fear of a particular animal type and be bitten by the animals ( Moyle et al . , 2013 ) . Human – robot intervention ( HRI ) , such as social robots , is an alternative to traditional HAI and can provide the same effect as live animals while avoiding issues such as bites or risk of disease ( Kramer , Friedmann , & Bernstein , 2009 ; Thodberg , Sørensen , Christensen , et al . , 2016 ) . A social robot is defined as an artificial agent embodied with features of a human or an animal ( Broekens , Heerink , & Rosendal , 2009 ; Hegel , Muhl , Wrede , Hielscher - Fastabend , & Sagerer , 2009 ) . It has been identified as an approach to meet the mental health needs of older adults through interaction or information exchange ( Broadbent , 2017 ) . The application and effectiveness of social robots have been investigated in mental health care ( David , Matu , & David , 2014 ; Rabbitt , Kazdin , & Scassellati , 2015 ) and aged care ( Khosravi & Ghapanchi , 2016 ; Sicurella & Fitzsimmons , 2016 ; Vandemeulebroucke , de Casterlé , & Gastmans , 2018 ) . The advantages of social robots include increased psychological and physiological well - being , as well as improved quality of life ( Costescu , Vanderborght , & David , 2014 ; Mordoch , Osterreicher , Guse , Roger , & Thompson , 2013 ) . However , mixed results have been reported regarding the effectiveness of social robots for older adults . Some studies found that interaction with social robots reduced agitation ( Jøranson , Pedersen , Rokstad , & Ihlebæk , 2015 ; Moyle , Bramble , Jones , & Murfield , 2017 ) , depression and anxiety ( Petersen , Houston , Qin , Tague , & Studley , 2017 ) , improved quality of life ( Moyle et al . , 2013 ) , or sustained quality of life in people with advanced dementia ( Jøranson , Pedersen , Rokstad , & Ihlebaek , 2016 ) . However , some other studies indicated that social robots have no sig - nificant affect on depression and quality of life ( Broadbent et al . , 2014 ; Robinson , MacDonald , Kerse , & Broadbent , 2013 ) . These conflicting results make it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of social robots . Previous reviews described the effectiveness of different types of socially assistive robots in aged care ( Bemelmans , Gelderblom , Jonker , & de Witte , 2012 ; Kachouie , Sedighadeli , Khosla , & Chu , 2014 ) . Shibata and Wada ( 2011 ) focused on the therapeutic use of the robotic seal PARO to improve the mental health of older adults , espe - cially for those with dementia . Existing reviews based on observational or nonrandomized studies ( Mordoch et al . , 2013 ; Rabbitt et al . , 2015 ) have added to knowledge basis and identified potential applications of social robots ; how - ever , a meta - analysis of well - designed randomized con - trolled trials ( RCTs ) can provide stronger evidence for social robot intervention . In addition , more RCTs have taken place in recent years with more researchers showing interests in robot therapy within aged care . Therefore , a systematic review and meta - analysis , based on currently available evidence of RCTs , is needed to clarify the benefits of social robots for older adults . Methods Search Strategy This review focuses on the existing RCTs using social robots in health care of older adults including those with and without cognitive impairment . This review has been registered with the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of systematic reviews ( registration number : CRD42017069542 ) . Online databases searched include Scopus , ProQuest ( Nursing & Allied Health Database and Psychology Database ) , PubMed , Medline and CINAHL ( via EBSCO ) , PsychINFO ( via OVID ) , Science Direct , Web of Science , and Cochrane Library in November 2016 ( search strategy was rerun on September 7 , 2017 ) . Key words followed the PICOS principals ( see Supplementary Material for detailed search strategy ) , including : Population : dementia or Alzheimer * or “cognitive impairment” or elder or elderly or “elderly people” or older or “older adults” or “older people” or aged or geriatric or senior Intervention : robot * or Paro or “seal robot” or “social inter - active robot * ” or “social assistive robot * ” or “social commitment robot * ” or “social interactive robot * ” or “assistive robot * ” or “companion robot * ” or “personal assistive robot * ” or “personal robot * ” or “therapeutic robot * ” or “therapeutic seal robot * ” or “robot * ther - apy” or “robot interaction” Outcomes : pain or “pain management” or “pain relief” or “pain medication” or analgesics or BPSD or “behav - iour and psychotic symptom” or “antisocial behavio * ” or “disruptive behavio * ” or “acting out” or agitat * or aggressi * or problematic or wandering or mood or engagement or “quality of life” or “social interaction” or “stress” or “robot interaction” or “behavio * dis - turbance” or “aggressive behavio * ” or “destructive behavio * ” or “resistive behavio * ” or depression or sleep or “sleep duration” or “sleep quality . ” Eligibility Titles and abstracts were screened according to the study inclusion criteria : ( a ) older adults ( main participants were 55 years or older ) ; ( b ) RCTs using social robots without restriction of robot type or intervention frequency ; ( c ) arti - cles were published in English . Excluded articles included : ( a ) subjects were children or younger adults ; ( b ) reviews , nonrandomized studies , study protocols , case studies , obser - vational studies , cross - sectional studies , qualitative studies , or pre – post studies without a control group ; as well as ( c ) conference abstracts without full - text . In addition , refer - ences of the included studies were screened for eligibility , and The Gerontologist , 2019 , Vol . 59 , No . 1 e38 there were no restrictions on the time of publication . After discarding duplicates , two reviewers ( L . Pu and C . Jones ) screened titles and abstracts independently according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria . Then , related articles with full - text were retrieved and reviewed by three independent reviewers ( L . Pu , C . Jones , and W . Moyle ) . The inter - rater agreement among reviewers was high ( κ = . 61 , p < . 001 ) and any disagreements were resolved through discussion . Quality Assessment Three reviewers ( L . Pu , C . Jones , and W . Moyle ) inde - pendently assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias in randomized trials ( Higgins et al . , 2011 ) , including ( a ) random sequence generation ( selection bias ) ; ( b ) allocation concealment ( selection bias ) ; ( c ) blinding of participants and personnel ( performance bias ) ; ( d ) blinding of outcome assessment ( detection bias ) ; ( e ) incomplete outcome data ( attrition bias ) ; ( f ) selective reporting ( reporting bias ) ; as well as ( g ) other bias . Judgments were grouped into three levels as “low risk of bias , ” “high risk of bias , ” or “unclear risk of bias . ” The reviewers assessed the quality of each study independently , and conflicting results were resolved through discussions . Data Extraction A data extraction form was designed for included studies , including : ( a ) study characteristics ( publication time , jour - nal , author , country , design , setting ) ; ( b ) participant ( age , gender , sample size , and level of cognitive impairment ) ; ( c ) intervention and control ( type of social robots , duration , intervention frequency , length of follow - up ) ; ( d ) outcome measurement ; as well as ( e ) results . This form was first piloted , and two reviewers extracted data independently and entered it into an excel spreadsheet . Data Synthesis The mean difference ( MD ) or standardized mean difference ( SMD ) with 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) was chosen to calculate the effect size of continuous outcomes . If reported , results from an analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) estimate were selected , which considers individual baseline scores as covariates to correct the phenomenon of regression to the mean for baseline imbalance ( Twisk & Proper , 2004 ) . Otherwise , change from baseline ( change value ) with stand - ard deviations ( SD s ) and final scores with SD s were selected when results from ANCOVA had not been reported . The number of participants included in the summary statistics was from each outcome measured in both groups . A ran - dom - effects model was applied given the clinical or meth - odological diversity across included studies . Heterogeneity between studies was measured by chi - square test ( p < . 10 and I 2 > 40 % ) . Subgroup analysis on individual and group intervention ; the level of cognitive impairment of partici - pants ; and self - report and proxy report results were under - taken where applicable . Missing data were obtained from study authors whenever possible ; otherwise missing SD s of change value was calculated with an estimated correla - tion from similar studies and missing SD s of final scores were imputed using the average SD s of similar studies in the meta - analysis . Moreover , carry - over effect and intra - cluster correlation coefficient ( ICC ) was considered for data imputation when cross - over or cluster RCTs were included . Studies with multi - arms resulted in the findings from rel - evant groups ( e . g . , different types of the social robot ) being combined to create a single pair - wise comparison . In addition , a sensitivity analysis was performed to check the robustness of results and publication bias were tested . Data synthesis was performed with RevMan 5 . 3 software . Results were also presented with a narrative summary if they could not be included in the meta - analysis . Results Selected Articles As shown in Figure 1 , a total of 2 , 202 articles were searched from the databases , and 2 articles were retrieved from reference searching . After removing duplicates , 1 , 655 articles were screened based on title and abstract , and a total of 1 , 470 articles were excluded . Therefore , 185 arti - cles remained for full - text screening , and 13 publications from 11 RCTs were identified to meet the study inclusion and exclusion criteria . Risk of Bias Most studies reported the method of random sequence generation , including computer generated programs ( Broadbent et al . , 2014 ; Moyle et al . , 2013 ) , random list generator ( Liang et al . , 2017 ; Robinson et al . , 2013 ) , ran - dom allocation by an external research center ( Jøranson et al . , 2015 ; Moyle , Jones , et al . , 2017 ) , coin toss ( Petersen et al . , 2017 ) , a six - sided die ( Soler et al . , 2015 ) and block randomization ( Thodberg , Sørensen , Christensen , et al . , 2016 ) . Low risk of allocation concealment was recorded from five trials ( Broadbent et al . , 2014 ; Jøranson et al . , 2015 ; Moyle et al . , 2013 ; Moyle , Jones , et al . , 2017 ; Soler et al . , 2015 ) . However , only two trials were judged as low risk of blinding the participants and personnel ( Broadbent et al . , 2014 ; Moyle , Jones , et al . , 2017 ) and less than half of the trials mentioned blinding of outcome assessors ( Broadbent et al . , 2014 ; Moyle et al . , 2013 ; Moyle , Jones , et al . , 2017 ; Soler et al . , 2015 ) . Three studies described the methods to manage missing data , including multiple impu - tation procedures ( Jøranson et al . , 2015 ) and intention - to - treat analysis ( Moyle , Jones , et al . , 2017 ) . Moyle and colleagues ( 2013 ) reported a large amount of missing data due to the advanced cognitive impairment of participants . The Gerontologist , 2019 , Vol . 59 , No . 1 e39 Two studies failed to provide enough data for meta - analysis ( Banks , Willoughby , & Banks , 2008 ; Thodberg , Sørensen , Christensen , et al . , 2016 ) and interpretation bias was observed in one study ( Jøranson et al . , 2015 ) . E - mails were sent to authors asking for more information , but no response was received . Therefore , nine studies were included in the meta - analysis . The risk of bias is presented in Figure 2 and additional file 2 . Study Characteristics Different study designs were identified among included studies , including cross - over studies ( Broadbent et al . , 2014 ; Moyle et al . , 2013 ) , two - arm ( parallel ) trials ( Jøranson et al . , 2015 ; Liang et al . , 2017 ; Petersen et al . , 2017 ; Robinson et al . , 2013 ; Tanaka et al . , 2012 ) and multiple - arm trials ( Banks et al . , 2008 ; Moyle , Jones , et al . , 2017 ; Soler et al . , 2015 ; Thodberg , Sørensen , Christensen , et al . , 2016 ) . These studies were conducted in seven different countries , including Denmark ( Thodberg , Sørensen , Christensen , et al . , 2016 ; Thodberg , Sørensen , Videbech , et al . , 2016 ) , Norway ( Jøranson et al . , 2015 , 2016 ) , New Zealand ( Liang et al . , 2017 ; Robinson et al . , 2013 ) , United States ( Banks et al . , 2008 ; Petersen et al . , 2017 ) , Australia ( Moyle et al . , 2013 ; Moyle , Jones , et al . , 2017 ) , Japan ( Tanaka et al . , 2012 ) , and Spain ( Soler et al . , 2015 ) . Participants A total of 1 , 042 older adults were included in the review , of which 80 % were diagnosed with dementia or cognitive Figure 1 . Flow chart of literature review . The Gerontologist , 2019 , Vol . 59 , No . 1 e40 impairment . The number of participants included in each trial ranged from 18 to 415 . The majority of studies were con - ducted in LTC facilities . However , one study ( Tanaka et al . , 2012 ) recruited older females from home settings ; Robinson and colleagues ( 2013 ) selected participants from both hos - pital and LTC , and Liang and colleagues ( 2017 ) conducted the intervention both at daycare centers and at participants’ homes . Detailed information is presented in Table 1 . Social Robots and Control Conditions Different types of social robot , such as animal - like robots and human - like robots , were used in the included studies . PARO ( an abbreviation of the Japanese phrase “Personal Assistance RobOt” ) , a robotic animal shaped like a baby harp seal , was the most popular and featured in eight stud - ies . In addition , a robotic dog AIBO ( Banks et al . , 2008 ) , a humanoid communication robot NAO ( Soler et al . , 2015 ) , a humanoid communication robot with features of 3 - year - old boy ( Tanaka et al . , 2012 ) and two health care robots IrobiQ and Cafero ( Broadbent et al . , 2014 ) were also used in aged care communities . As for control groups , in one study reading activities were provided as a control condi - tion ( Moyle et al . , 2013 ) . Another study used a similar toy as an active control ( Tanaka et al . , 2012 ) . In another two studies , participants allocated to the control group received live dog visits ( Robinson et al . , 2013 ; Thodberg , Sørensen , Christensen , et al . , 2016 ) . In the remaining seven studies , the participants in the control group received usual care or standard treatment without robots or pets . Detailed infor - mation is presented in Table 2 . Intervention Form and Duration Four trials were conducted with group interventions ranging from 20 to 45 min per session . Individual robot Figure 2 . Risk of bias summary . The Gerontologist , 2019 , Vol . 59 , No . 1 e41 interaction activities were employed in five studies var - ying from 10 to 30 min per session , whereas another study ( Soler et al . , 2015 ) adopted group sessions for residents with mild or mild - moderate dementia and individual sessions for patients with moderate - severe and severe dementia . Participants from one study ( Liang et al . , 2017 ) received group interventions in daycare centers and individual interventions at home . In terms of the intervention period , the minimum duration was 5 weeks and the maximum 12 weeks . As only three stud - ies ( Jøranson et al . , 2015 ; Liang et al . , 2017 ; Moyle , Jones , et al . , 2017 ) had follow - up visits at different times ( e . g . , 12 weeks , 6 weeks , and 5 weeks after interven - tion ) , immediate postintervention results were selected for data analysis . Statistical Analysis Baseline between intervention and control groups was similar in included studies , and the majority of included studies reported the final score rather than ANCOVA estimates ; therefore , the final score with its SD s was synthesized to calculate the effect size . As for missing data imputation , SD s of final score ( Petersen et al . , 2017 ) were calculated using the average SD s from similar stud - ies ( Jøranson et al . , 2015 ; Liang et al . , 2017 ; Soler et al . , 2015 ) . As two cross - over studies ( Broadbent et al . , 2014 ; Moyle et al . , 2013 ) described 3 weeks and 18 days of wash - out to reduce carry - over effects , we , therefore , included results from both periods . However , this method ignored the within - patient correlation and ren - dered our results to be more conservative . Results from two cluster trials ( Jøranson et al . , 2015 ; Moyle , Jones , et al . , 2017 ) were imputed according to the reported ICC ( 0 . 84 and 0 . 068 , respectively ) to calculate the effec - tive sample size . Subgroup analysis for self - report and proxy report results was performed for anxiety and qual - ity of life measures . However , subgroup analysis was not viable on the types of intervention ( i . e . , individual or group ) or the level of cognitive impairment on key outcome measures ( except for cognition ) as there were studies that adopted a combination of different types of interventions and included participants with or without cognitive impairment . We evaluated the effect of each Table 1 .

The Gerontologist , 2019 , Vol . 59 , No . 1 e43 Meta - Analysis Results of the Social Robot Intervention Agitation , Neuropsychiatric Symptoms , and Anxiety Jøranson and colleagues ( 2015 ) reported the Brief Agitation Rating scale ( BARS ) score while the other two studies reported the Cohen - Mansfield Agitation Inventory - Short Form ( CAMI - SF ) score ( Liang et al . , 2017 ; Moyle , Jones , et al . , 2017 ) , so the SMD was used to summarize the results . A small but not statistically significant effect was observed for agitation ( three studies , 216 participants , SMD : −0 . 20 , 95 % CI : −0 . 57 to 0 . 17 ; Figure 3 ) and no significant effect was observed for neuropsychiatric symptoms measured by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory ( NPI ) and Neuropsychiatric Inventory Brief Questionnaire ( NPI - Q ) ( two studies , 95 participants , SMD : 0 . 09 , 95 % CI : −0 . 27 to 0 . 45 ; Figure 4 ) . The MD of anxiety measured with the self - reported Rating Anxiety in Dementia ( RAID ) was 2 . 8 ( 95 % CI : −1 . 58 to 7 . 18 ) and the staff rated anxiety was −1 . 14 ( 95 % CI : −6 . 54 to 4 . 26 ) , suggesting that social robots have the potential to reduce staff rated anxiety for people with dementia ( Figure 5 ) . Depressive Symptoms and Apathy Three studies reported the Cornell Scale for Symptoms of Depression in Dementia ( CSDD ) score while the other three reported the Geriatric Depression Scale ( GDS ) score . There were no statistically significant effects for depressive symptoms ( seven Figure 3 . Forest plot : Social robots for agitation ( n = 3 ) . Figure 4 .

Cognitive Level Four studies provided sufficient raw data to explore the effectiveness of robots on cognition . Three different scales were used including Mini - Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) , Global Deterioration Scale ( GDS ) , and Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination . No signifi - cant result was observed on cognition for people with dementia ( SMD : 0 . 04 , 95 % CI : −0 . 33 to 0 . 26 ) and those without dementia ( SMD : 0 . 40 , 95 % CI : −0 . 28 to 1 . 09 ; Figure 8 ) .

The Gerontologist , 2019 , Vol . 59 , No . 1 e45 Quality of Life Four studies measured the effect of PARO on quality of life with 297 individuals living with dementia ( Jøranson et al . , 2016 ; Moyle et al . , 2013 ; Robinson et al . , 2013 ; Soler et al . , 2015 ) . Two studies reported the Quality of Life in Late - Stage Dementia scale ( QUALID ) final score ( Jøranson et al . , 2016 ; Soler et al . , 2015 ) and the other two reported the Quality of life for Alzheimer’s Disease ( QoL - AD ) final score ( Moyle et al . , 2013 ; Robinson et al . , 2013 ) . The SMD for self - reported QoL of people with dementia was 0 . 21 ( 95 % CI : −0 . 47 to 0 . 88 ) and 0 . 24 ( 95 % CI : −0 . 21 to 0 . 69 ) for staff rated QoL favoring the social robot intervention , but not at a statistically significant level ( Figure 9 ) . A baseline difference in the Health - Related Quality of Life short form ( SF - 12 ) score but without ANCOVA analysis was reported by Broadbent and colleagues ( 2014 ) . However , we did not include this result in the meta - analysis because imbalance at baseline may bias the comparison of the final score . Description of Outcomes Not Suitable for Meta - Analysis Meta - analysis was not applied to the outcomes of behav - ioral observation of engagement and social interaction , physiological responses , and medication because not enough data were obtained from the included studies . Instead , the effectiveness of social robots on these domains was described and summarized in a narrative review . Engagement , Social Interaction , and Loneliness Positive results of engagement and social interaction between participants and social robots were reported in three studies ( Liang et al . , 2017 ; Moyle , Jones , et al . , 2017 ; Thodberg , Sørensen , Videbech , et al . , 2016 ) using meth - ods of direct observation or video recordings . Compared to a plush toy or a usual care group , residents with social robots were significantly more engaged in interactions with positive facial expressions and verbal communication with staff , while neutral expressions were reduced ( Moyle , Jones , et al . , 2017 ) . In addition , evidence from two trials ( Banks et al . , 2008 ; Robinson et al . , 2013 ) suggested that robot interactions positively decreased the level of loneliness . Physiological Indicators Data from two trials ( Tanaka et al . , 2012 ; Thodberg , Sørensen , Christensen , et al . , 2016 ) indicated that there was no effect of social robots on body mass index ( BMI ) , but there was a positive effect on sleep . In addition , Petersen and colleagues ( 2017 ) pointed out that PARO could improve oxygenation and cardiac status of people with dementia measured by pulse rate , pulse oximetry , and galvanic skin response ( GSR ) , indicating decreased levels of anxiety and stress . Similar find - ings were found with reduced level of saliva cortisol ( Tanaka et al . , 2012 ) . However , Liang and colleagues ( 2017 ) found no significant differences in physiological indexes , including salivary and hair cortisol , blood pressure , as well as heart rate between participants in control and intervention groups . Medication Jøranson and colleagues ( 2016 ) found that a PARO inter - vention could reduce the use of psychotropic drugs in people with severe dementia . However , there was no difference in medication usage for people with mild or moderate demen - tia . Petersen and colleagues ( 2017 ) also implied that psycho - active medication use decreased after a 3 - month period of Figure 9 . Forest plot : Social robots for the quality of life ( n = 4 ) . The Gerontologist , 2019 , Vol . 59 , No . 1 e46 a PARO intervention . Furthermore , the intervention group used significantly less pain medication when compared with control groups , whereas there was no difference in sleep medication or depression medication . Similar results were reported with no significant differences in the use of demen - tia - related medication ( Liang et al . , 2017 ) and medication adherence ( Broadbent et al . , 2014 ) . Discussion Social robots have developed very quickly in recent years and have been used in several countries . However , the effective - ness of social robots for older adults is not well established . As far as we know , this is the first systematic review and meta - analysis of RCTs to evaluate the effectiveness of social robots for older adults and provides a higher level of evidence for health care providers . Pooled results indicate that social robots have the potential to reduce agitation and anxiety , as well as improve quality of life for older adults . The narrative review indicates that interacting with social robots improves engagement and communication , as well as reduces loneli - ness , stress responses , and medication use in older adults . Quality of the Evidence Although eleven studies were included in this review , most of the included studies were of low to moderate quality and only one trial conducted by Moyle , Jones , and colleagues ( 2017 ) met the seven criteria for RCTs . Nine studies reported the method of randomization , but concealment of allocation was unclear in most studies . Although blinding of participants was challenging in social robot interventions , blinding of assessors was practical but only reported in four trials . There was a high drop - out in interventions involving older adults , and missing data management was poorly reported in the included studies . Two trials had an issue of selective reporting resulting in insuf - ficient data being included in the meta - analysis . Therefore , more rigorously designed studies should be conducted to jus - tify the effectiveness of social robots scientifically . Participants and Intervention Examined In this review , seven studies involved participants with cog - nitive impairment or dementia , three studies recruited par - ticipants without cognitive impairment , and the remaining study included participants regardless of their level of cog - nitive function . Both groups of individuals benefited from the social robot interventions , especially for those with dementia . However , inconsistent results were observed in terms of the effects of social robots on participants with dif - ferent stages of dementia , but we could not conduct a sub - group analysis based on the severity of dementia because most studies reported their results generally . According to Liang and colleagues ( 2017 ) , people with higher cognitive capabilities engaged more actively than those with lower capabilities , which is similar to findings reported in pre - vious research ( Takayanagi , Kirita , & Shibata , 2014 ) . In contrast , Jøranson and colleagues ( 2016 ) found that people with advanced dementia benefited from social robots for sustained quality of life and the robot reduced psychotropic medication , whereas no significant differences were found for those groups with mild / moderate dementia . In add - ition , a quasi - experimental study ( Bemelmans , Gelderblom , Jonker , & de Witte , 2015 ) using PARO in intramural psy - chogeriatric care found no significant difference in terms of therapeutic outcomes among patients with different stages of dementia . Therefore , more research is needed to iden - tify the relationship between the severity of dementia and responses from using social robots . Interventions in this review varied largely in the format , frequency , and duration as well as settings of the interven - tion . Compared to group interventions , individual inter - actions with PARO were more acceptable and applicable , where users could interact and engage with PARO in a per - sonalized way ( Liang et al . , 2017 ; Moyle et al . , 2013 ) . In addition , evidence suggested that determining users’ prefer - ences or on a per need basis may improve the acceptability and perceived benefits ( Kachouie et al . , 2014 ) . Furthermore , individual interventions can minimize the interactions of residents with the facilitator and with others in the setting , which indicates that any benefits are more likely to be due to the intervention than any confounding variables . There is still a lack of RCTs comparing the effectiveness of different dosages of the intervention , such as frequency and duration of the use of the social robot with older adults . Evidence from animal - assisted therapy ( AAT ) may provide some guidance regarding the dose – response effects of social robot interventions . Results from a meta - analysis of AAT ( Nimer & Lundahl , 2007 ) found that the number of AAT sessions was associated with better behavioral outcomes , such as social interaction or communication , but it was negatively related to well - being , such as anxiety and depres - sion . Similarly , Virués - Ortega , Pastor - Barriuso , Castellote , Población , and de Pedro - Cuesta ( 2012 ) suggested that highly intensive AAT interventions may lead to an exhaustion of intervention effects in older adults . These results indicate that the dosage of interventions could be designed according to different outcomes or the preferences of individuals . Further research should focus on the dose – response effects as well as the duration of social robot intervention required to achieve positive outcomes . Effects of Social Robots on Behavioral and Psychological Indicators This review indicated that social robots improved agitation and anxiety , but the results were not statistically significant . Although no obvious effects were found on neuropsychi - atric symptoms , apathy , and depression , previous inter - views with older people mentioned that social robots could help them get through the “gloomy days” ( Šabanovi ć , Chang , Bennett , Piatt , & Hakken , 2015 ) . Results from a 17 - month observational experiment also supported this result ( Kazuyoshi , Takanori , Tomoko , Kayoko , & Kazuo , The Gerontologist , 2019 , Vol . 59 , No . 1 e47 2005 ) , indicating that interaction with robots provides stimulation , relaxation , and comfort to participants . It is not surprising the summarized results did not show any significant differences as only a small number of studies with the majority having small sample sizes were included in this review . This indicates that studies with larger sample sizes are warranted in this research field . Effects of Social Robots on Cognitive Function No significant result was found for cognitive function , but this result is limited to subjective outcome measures . However , some experiments reported improved brain func - tion of participants examined by objective devices ( e . g . , elec - troencephalogram or functional near - infrared spectroscopy ) when people were interacting with social robots . Improved cortical neuron activity was observed for 29 people with dementia after 20 min of robot therapy ( Wada , Shibata , Musha , & Kimura , 2005 ) . Similar results were also found for adults ( Kawaguchi et al . , 2011 ) , which implied that robot therapy has a high potential to improve brain activity and delay the process of cognitive impairment of demen - tia . However , these studies were conducted with small sam - ple sizes and short - term interventions , further experiments involving more participants are needed to investigate the long - term effects of robots on brain function of older adults . Effects of Social Robots on Quality of Life The pooled results indicated that social robots might have the potential to improve both self - report and staff - report quality of life of older adults , but the result was not statistically sig - nificant . This finding is consistent with previous studies which found that social robot interventions had a positive effect on quality of life ( Bemelmans et al . , 2015 ; Kanamori et al . , 2003 ) . Furthermore , compared to the control condition , a higher level of proxy - rated quality of life was observed in people with dementia after interacting with social robots , but this effect was limited to those with advanced dementia ( Jøranson et al . , 2016 ; Soler et al . , 2015 ) . This may be explained by the fact that older people may experience reduced interaction and social engagement due to limited access to meaningful activities , thus social robots could increase communication and stimulation to fill this gap and provide therapeutic com - panionship . In addition , people who positively interacted with the robots may experience further improvement in their quality of life ( Kanamori et al . , 2003 ; Moyle et al . , 2013 ) , and in particular , for those with late stages of dementia . However , the effect of social robots on the quality of life for people with mild / moderate dementia is still unclear . Effects of Social Robots on Engagement , Social Interaction , and Loneliness This review indicated that social robots improved engagement and social interaction of older adults and had the potential to reduce loneliness . This is an important finding as loneliness , and social isolation increases with older age , in particular , for people living with dementia ( Nicholson , 2012 ) . Although group activities don’t allow members to engage for lengthy periods with the social robot , nonetheless actively engaging people with dementia in meaningful group activities with a social robot may help to increase social interaction , which may further stimulate engagement between group members and therefore reduce loneliness ( Chu , Khosla , Khaksar , & Nguyen , 2017 ; Masi , Chen , Hawkley , & Cacioppo , 2011 ; Moyle , Bramble , et al . , 2017 ) . Observation notes or video recordings are common ways to measure engagement ; how - ever , a comprehensive coding protocol for engagement should be developed at the project planning stage to avoid observer bias . For example , Jones , Sung , and Moyle ( 2015 ) developed a video coding scheme ( VC - IOE ) to detect six dimensions of engagement including emotional , verbal , visual , behavioral , collective , and signs of agitation . In addition , research is also needed to increase understanding of approaches to enhance or improve engagement duration of users toward social robots to further design personal centered services . Effects of the Social Robot on Physiological Indicators Results from three studies indicated that social robot interventions could improve sleep and reduce stress levels . According to a recent study ( Robinson , MacDonald , & Broadbent , 2015 ) , both systolic and diastolic blood pressure significantly decreased when older people interacted with PARO , and their heart rate decreased as well . Meanwhile , Petersen and colleagues ( 2017 ) also found pulse oximetry and GSR were increased , while pulse rate decreased com - pared to the control group . A reduced value of 17 - KS - S ( 17 - Ketosteroid sulfate ) and increased ratio of 17 - KS - S / 17 - OHCS ( 17 - hydroxycorticosteroids ) from urinary tests was observed , which confirmed that interaction with social robots might decrease stress levels ( Wada & Shibata , 2007 ; Wada , Shibata , Saito , Sakamoto , & Tanie , 2005 ) . This may be explained by increased levels of oxytocin , which can be released by non - noxious sensory stimulation , such as touch , stroking , light pressure during interaction with social robots ( Handlin et al . , 2011 ; Jøranson et al . , 2015 ) . Oxytocin offers anti - stress effects and increases the pain threshold ( Beetz et al . , 2012 ) . In addition , therapy dog visits have been shown to increase levels of oxytocin ( Handlin et al . , 2011 ; Miller et al . , 2009 ) . Future studies may combine the measurement of oxytocin and biomarkers of stress , such as cortisol , to pro - vide more evidence regarding the underlying mechanism of the physiological effects of social robots on older adults . Effects of the Social Robot on Medications Evidence indicated that robot interactions can reduce pain medications and psychotropic medications for people with dementia . According to the progressively lowered stress The Gerontologist , 2019 , Vol . 59 , No . 1 e48 threshold ( PLST ) model ( Richards & Beck , 2004 ) , unman - aged pain may be regarded as a physical stressor that con - tributes to stress - related behaviors ( Brecher & West , 2016 ; Sampson et al . , 2015 ) and mood ( Husebo , Ballard , Fritze , Sandvik , & Aarsland , 2014 ; Jaremka et al . , 2014 ) . People might be distracted from their pain and anxiety when inter - acting with robots ( Lane et al . , 2016 ; Marti , Bacigalupo , Giusti , Mennecozzi , & Shibata , 2006 ; Roger , Guse , Mordoch , & Osterreicher , 2012 ) , thus decreasing disruptive behaviors and medication usage . However , Petersen and colleagues ( 2017 ) pointed out that although depression improved for participants , health providers were reluctant to change par - ticipants’ antidepressant medication , which suggested that physicians and pharmacists should be involved in a multi - disciplinary team advocating psychosocial interventions to help to manage medications for residents . Furthermore , as little is known about the effectiveness of social robots on pain management in older adults , especially in people with dementia , this area is worthy of study . Limitations and Future Research This study is the first systematic review and meta - analysis of RCTs exploring the effectiveness of social robots for older adults . The use of defined inclusion / exclusion criteria , application of a rigorous search strategy from eight data - bases , strict quality assessment of the studies and systematic combination of findings , are the strengths of this review . However , there are some limitations . First , the small num - ber of trials and participants included in this review reflects the paucity of RCTs in the research field of social robots for older adults . Second , a large variation of intervention types may influence the pooled results due to the substantial clin - ical heterogeneity . Although results from this review offer guidance regarding social robot interventions for older adults , they should be interpreted with caution because only a few studies were included in the subgroup meta - analysis . In addition , subgroup analysis based on the level of cognitive impairment or intervention types was limited . Inadequate information related to outcomes from included RCTs is also a potential source of bias , suggesting a need for RCTs to follow reporting guidelines . Third , language bias may be considered because only RCTs published in the English language were selected and the age selection was 55 years old , which may exclude younger adults with physical disabilities who may also benefit from social robot intervention . Although RCT is the gold standard of evi - dence for the highest internal validity , caution is needed in generalizing the findings to a broader population in clinical practice due to the unique subject population in this review . Furthermore , ethical issues should be considered as HRI is not designed to replace human contact but regarded as a possible adjunct to HAI in the care of vulnerable older adults . Human rights and autonomy should be respected during the application of social robots as some individuals may prefer live animal interaction . Conclusions This systematic review integrates evidence from RCTs of social robot use with older adults . A total of 13 articles from 11 studies were included in this review . The results implied that current RCTs about social robots were predominately of low to moderate quality , especially in the allocation of concealment and blinding of assessors . Additional rigor - ously designed studies should be conducted to confirm the effectiveness of social robot use in older adults . Results indicate that robot interactions have potential effects on agitation , anxiety and loneliness , medication consumption as well as the quality of life for older adults . But the poten - tial for social robots to improve cognition , depression , and apathy needs further investigation .
