This tabula rasa for embryogenesis is present only transiently in the preimplantation epiblast . Here , we consider how unrestricted cells are ﬁrst generated and then prepared for lineage commit - ment . We propose that two phases of pluripotency can be deﬁned : naive and primed . This distinction extends to pluripotent stem cells derived from embryos or by molecular reprogramming ex vivo . Mammalian embryos produce extraembryonic cells prior to deﬁning the founder population for the embryo proper ( Gardner , 1983 ; Selwood and Johnson , 2006 ) . The primary role of the extraembryonic lineages is to mediate uterine implantation and subsequent maternal sustenance of the growing embryo and fetus . In recent years , it has been discovered that extraembry - onic tissues also supply powerful inductive signals that specify and pattern early development ( Beddington and Robertson , 1999 ) . To form the embryo , a pool of uncommitted cells must be established and poised to respond to those signals . This pop - ulation is the epiblast . Generation of naive epiblast several days after fertilization is a process unique to the mammalian life cycle . This progression does not occur through simple inheritance from the fertilized egg , nor is epiblast speciﬁed by segregation of maternal determinants . How the emerging epiblast is shielded from extraembryonic differentiation and concomitantly gains the capacity to generate all cell types of the fetus and subse - quent adult , including the germ cells , are fundamental questions in mammalian development . Moreover , the aspiration to exploit ex vivo pluripotent stem cells for biomedical beneﬁt surely requires elucidation of their precise nature and relationship to pluripotent cells in the embryo . The Limitation of Totipotency The fertilized mammalian embryo initially undergoes cleavage division in a stereotypic fashion that is unresponsive to extrinsic perturbation . After a ﬁxed number of cell cycles , the individual blastomeres become compacted together , and those on the outside begin to form an epithelium , the trophoblast ( Selwood and Johnson , 2006 ) . The resulting structure with an internalized group of cells is called the blastocyst . Up to the time of blastocyst formation , the fate of individual cells can be altered by changing their position within the embryo ( Hillman et al . , 1972 ) . Transplantation studies conﬁrm that single blastomeres have the potential to generate both extraembryonic and embry - onic lineages ( Gardner , 1998 ) . Moreover , normal development can ensue following removal of one or more cells from the 8 - or 16 - cell embryo . This adaptability is exploited in a clinical setting to allow for pregestational diagnosis of severe genetic disease . These ﬁndings argue persuasively against an essential role for asymmetric segregation of determinants inherited from the egg . Because it can give rise to an entire embryo , the mammalian egg is often described as totipotent . However , this description does not mean that the egg itself has the ability to differentiate into all cell types . In reality , the mammalian zygote follows a determined program of restricted differentiation . If blastomeres are dissociated , they divide and differentiate on schedule to form trophoblast vesicles or microblastocysts with as few as 2 cells ( Tarkowski and Wroblewska , 1967 ; Ziomek and Johnson , 1980 ) . Thus , the egg and blastomeres produce directly only two cell types , the trophoblast and the inner cell mass ( ICM ) . For subsequent development , cells within the ICM must acquire the capacity to generate other cell types and to do so in a ﬂexible manner ( Gardner and Beddington , 1988 ) . The ICM produces a second extraembryonic lineage , the hypoblast , and around the same time , the remaining cells develop into pluripotent epiblast . The epiblast is functionally and molecularly distinct from blastomeres and early inner cell mass ( Gardner , 1998 ; Kaji et al . , 2007 ; Kurimoto et al . , 2006 ) . Formation of the blasto - cyst is a deterministic preparatory process dictated by the requirement to elaborate extraembryonic tissues . In comparison with development in other vertebrates , this period may be viewed as a preembryonic stage ( Selwood and Johnson , 2006 ) . Thus , rather than representing a diminution in potency from the egg , we suggest that the epiblast constitutes the ground state , meaning a fully unrestricted population that harbors the requisite developmental potency and ﬂexibility to produce all embryonic lineages . Regulative Development and Stem Cell Character The early mammalian embryo has a remarkable ability to ac - commodate alterations in cell numbers . Additional cells can be introduced into preimplantation embryos and will readily be incorporated into normal development , resulting in chimeric animals . In more extreme examples , miniblastocysts , produced by separating 2 - cell embryos , or giant blastocysts , generated by combining two or more cleavage stage embryos , develop into normal - sized fetuses and viable animals . This regulative capacityisreminiscentoftheﬂexibilityassociatedwithstemcells ( Gardner and Beddington , 1988 ) . The ﬁnding that progenitors of Cell Stem Cell 4 , June 5 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . 487 all three blastocyst lineages—trophoblast , hypoblast , and epiblast—can be propagated continuously in vitro ( Rossant , 2008 ) is consistent with an underlying element of stem cell character . Importantly , however , this plasticity does not extend to transdetermination across lineages . How extraembryonic lineage segregation is secured while pluripotency develops in adjacent cells are intertwined issues in preimplantation develop - ment ( Niwa , 2007 ) . The Ground State and True Embryonic Stem Cells The newly formed epiblast is a cluster of 10 – 20 unspecialized cells sandwiched between the trophoblast and the hypoblast ( Figures 1 and 2 ) . The epiblast generates the entire fetus and single mouse epiblast cells , isolated at this stage and microin - jected into another blastocyst , can contribute to all lineages ( Gardner , 1998 ) . Functionally , therefore , preimplantation epiblast is the developmental ground state . Embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) can be derived at this point ( Evans and Kaufman , 1981 ; Martin , 1981 ) . ESCs represent immortalization of the naive epiblast . Under appropriate condi - tions , they exhibit unlimited self - renewal capacity while retaining the attributes of preimplantation epiblast identity and potency . Speciﬁcally , when returned to the blastocyst , ESCs are readily incorporated into the epiblast and re - enter embryonic develop - ment to produce functional soma and germ cells ( Bradley et al . , 1984 ) . ESCs also share an epigenetic feature with preim - plantation epiblast . This shared trait is the presence of two active X chromosomes in female cells . In female embryos , the pater - nally inherited X chromosome is silenced during cleavage and remains silent in extraembryonic lineages . Reactivation occurs transiently in the pluripotent lineage prior to implantation ( Heard , 2004 ) . X chromosome activation not only provides an epigenetic signature of ground state pluripotency but , in females , is critical to allow for random inactivation in the soma and , thus , avoid functional hemizygosity . The epiblast has been identiﬁed unequivocally as a source of ESCs by means of microsurgical separation from trophoblast and hypoblast prior to culture ( Batlle - Morera et al . , 2008 ; Brook and Gardner , 1997 ) . These experiments also suggested that removal of the extraembryonic tissues may facilitate ESC deriva - tion . ESCs have also been obtained from mouse embryos placed in culture prior to epiblast formation , which has sown some confusion as to their precise origin and identity . It should be borne in mind , however , that embryonic cells are not frozen at the stage when they are put in culture but may continue to follow a developmental program . Thus , cells may progress to the epiblast stage even if isolated from earlier stage embryos . Indeed , mouse ESC lines are molecularly and phenotypically alike , however they have been derived . The original key to success in deriving ESCs was coculture with mouse embryo ﬁbroblasts , now known to produce the cyto - kine leukemia inhibitory factor ( Lif ) . Lif activates the transcription factor Stat3 , which inhibits ESC differentiation and promotes viability ( Smith , 2001 ) . Genetic and biochemical studies have indicated that stimulation of the Erk pathway by Fgf4 and other extrinsic stimuli is a signal that primes ESCs for lineage speciﬁ - cation ( Burdon et al . , 1999 ; Kunath et al . , 2007 ; Stavridis et al . , 2007 ) . Recently it has been found that blockade of this pathway and ancillary suppression of glycogen synthase kinase - 3 ( Gsk3 ) with selective small molecule inhibitors ( 3i or 2i ) is sufﬁcient to stabilize and sustain ESCs with full pluripotency ( Silva and Smith , 2008 ; Ying et al . , 2008 ) . In our experience , all ESCs , however derived or previously cultured , can be propagated in serum - free culture using these inhibitors with optional addition of Lif . We , therefore , propose that independence from Erk signaling may be a biochemical correlate of the ground state . In line with this idea , use of 2i plus Lif facilitates the isolation of authentic induced pluripotent stem cell ( iPSC ) lines with full pluripotent capacity ( Guo et al . , 2009 ; Silva et al . , 2008 ; Sridharan et al . , 2009 ) . This competence appears to be mediated through a combination of both selection for and stabilization of the ground state ( Silva et al . , 2008 ; Silva and Smith , 2008 ) . An issue that remains unresolved is whether the derivation of ESCs may entail some reversible epigenetic adaptation to the Figure 1 . Two Phases of Pluripotency Ground state naive pluripotency is established in the epiblast of the mature blastocyst and may be captured in vitro in the form of ESCs . Shortly after implantation , the epiblast transforms into a cup - shaped epithelium and becomes primed for lineage speciﬁcation and commitment in response to stimuli from the extraembryonic tissues . EpiSCs are the in vitro counterpart of primed epiblast . ESCs can be induced to differentiate into EpiSCs by expo - suretoactivinandFgf , butthereversetransitionrequirestransfectionwithKlf4 or other reprogramming factors .

The epiblast is displaced downward after implantation due to proliferation of the trophecto - derm - derived extraexembryonic ectoderm and the constraint of the uterine wall . Lower images show representative colonies of ESCs and EpiSCs . See Batlle - Morera et al . ( 2008 ) and Guo et al . ( 2009 ) for details of embryo dissec - tion , ESC and EpiSC culture , and photography . 488 Cell Stem Cell 4 , June 5 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . Cell Stem Cell Perspective ex vivo environment ( Buehr and Smith , 2003 ) . In other words , are ESCs created in vitro or are they captured directly from the epiblast ? By plating dissociated cells , a maximum of three inde - pendent ESC clones have been established from a single epiblast ( Brook and Gardner , 1997 ) . These authors suggest that only a subset of cells within the epiblast may be truly plurip - otent and consequently capable of producing ESCs . Relatively low efﬁciency , and pronounced differences in ability to derive ESCs between mouse strains , could also be due to a limiting epigenetic reprogramming step . Revisiting this experiment using the 3i / 2i culture conditions will test the hypothesis of a common ground state both within the preimplantation epiblast and between epiblast and ESCs . We speculate that epiblast cells resident in the blastocyst are in a similar biochemical state to ESCs and may require little or no adaptation to culture if insu - lated from Erk signaling . The Primed Pluripotent State and ‘‘Human ESCs’’ After uterine implantation , the rodent epiblast converts into a single - cell layer of columnar epithelium ( Kaufman , 1992 ) . This conversion is associated with a morphological transformation into a cup - shaped structure known as the egg cylinder ( Figure 1 ) . In XX embryos , one of the X chromosomes undergoes random inactivation in early egg cylinder epiblast cells ( Heard , 2004 ) . The epiblast is then subject to a systematic topological bombardment with inductive factors emanating from the adja - cent yolk sac and trophoblast tissue ( Beddington and Robert - son , 1999 ) . These molecules include ﬁbroblast growth factors , bone morphogenetic proteins , Wnts , and their respective antag - onists . Egg cylinder epiblast cells , therefore , become instruc - tively speciﬁed according to their location . Transplantations between egg cylinders indicate that fates can still be altered at this stage ( Gardner and Beddington , 1988 ) . However , postim - plantation epiblast cells cannot contribute to blastocyst chimeras ( Rossant , 2008 ) , nor can they give rise to ESCs . Cell lines have now been derived from postimplantation mouse epiblasts using culture conditions without Lif but including Fgf and activin ( Brons et al . , 2007 ; Tesar et al . , 2007 ) . These cells , termed EpiSCs , express core pluripotency factors , Oct4 , Sox2 , and Nanog , but differ from ESCs in expression of several other transcripts . EpiSCs are able to differentiate into various cell types in vitro , but this capacity has not been studied extensively to date . It is conceivable that EpiSC lines could be biased in how efﬁciently they can be committed to different line - ages , depending upon their inductive history in the embryo , or deﬁned by the EpiSC culture conditions . If so , this skewing could offer an advantage for directed differentiation along speciﬁc line - ages . Alternatively , any pre - existing lineage bias may be erased in culture . However , EpiSCs are not competent to contribute to blastocyst chimeras ( Guo et al . , 2009 ; Tesar et al . , 2007 ) and are , therefore , developmentally and functionally distinct from naive epiblast and ESCs ( see Table 1 ) . EpiSCs can also be produced from ESCs in culture ( Guo et al . , 2009 ) . This conversion fulﬁlls the criteria for an authentic differ - entiation process because the reverse transition has not been observed without genetic manipulation . Consistent with a true differentiation event , one copy of the X chromosome in XX cells is epigenetically silenced as ESCs become EpiSCs . However , EpiSCs still express the canonical pluripotency factors and can be reprogrammed to naive pluripotency by transfection with just a single factor , Klf4 ( Guo et al . , 2009 ) . The resulting iPSCs show reactivation of the X chromosome , exhibit the ESC - speciﬁc transcriptional proﬁle , produce high contribution somatic chimeras , and give germline transmission . The production of mouse EpiSCs from somatic cells by molec - ular reprogramming has not been reported . However , it would be Figure 2 .

Cell Stem Cell 4 , June 5 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . 489 Cell Stem Cell Perspective difﬁcult to discriminate induced EpiSCs from ground state cells using morphology or the standard Oct4 - GFP reporters . It would be interesting to know if reprogramming in Fgf and activin culture conditions yields EpiSCs , particularly if Klf4 was excluded or selectively silenced . In the absence of chimeras , the standard assay to assess pluripotency is formation of teratomas , which are tumors that contain tissues representative of all three germlayers . Teratomas occur naturally as germline tumors . It is surely not a coincidence that germ cells can be reprogrammed to pluripotency in culture without genetic manipulation ( Kanatsu - Shinohara et al . , 2004 ; Matsui et al . , 1992 ; Resnick et al . , 1992 ) . Before discovery of ESCs , undifferentiated cells isolated from teratomas were found to retain the capacity at single - cell level to reform multidifferen - tiated tumors ( Kleinsmith and Pierce , 1964 ; Martin , 1980 ) . These cancer stem cells are called embryonal carcinoma ( EC ) cells . A few EC cell lines were able to contribute to chimeras , but the majority could not , an outcome traditionally attributed to karyo - typic abnormalities ( Martin , 1980 ) . It is possible , however , that many EC cells are , in fact , more like EpiSCs than ESCs . It would be interesting to attempt propagation of EC cells from teratocar - cinomas generated from ESCs and EpiSCs , comparing ground state ESC conditions with EpiSC conditions . The results of this investigation could reveal whether progression through a tumor induces conversion of the grafted cells in either direction . A variation of the EpiSC culture regime applied to mouse blastocysts has recently been reported to yield another type of cell line , termed FAB - SCs ( Chou et al . , 2008 ) . These cultures propagate continuously but are unable to contribute to chimaeras or to form teratomas . However , transfer of early passage cultures to ESC medium containing serum factors and Lif results in the ability to produce teratomas and , at very low frequency , chimaeras . The authors interpret this observation as reﬂective of a developmental transition and argue that there may be multiple pluripotent states ( Chou et al . , 2008 ) . This hypothesis is an intriguing notion , even if it is difﬁcult to compre - hend why a cell type with no evident differentiation potential should be described as pluripotent . An embryonic stage to which FAB - SCs would be counterpart is unclear . Critically , the authors do not show data to exclude the likelihood that the FAB - SC cultures harbor a small fraction of epiblast / ESCs that can expand if stimulated with Lif . It is essential to test this possibility because it is well known that residual ESCs can persist in many coculture environments , including EpiSC culture conditions ( Guo et al . , 2009 ) . Pluripotent cell lines have been derived from human blasto - cysts ( Thomson et al . , 1998 ) . These lines differ signiﬁcantly from mouse ESCs in their culture requirements , morphology , clonogenicity , differentiation behavior , and molecular proﬁle . Furthermore , the deﬁnitive functional criterion for ESC identity , contribution to blastocyst chimeras , cannot be applied in human . Their designation has been based on teratoma forma - tion , which is now shown to be a common property of ESCs and EpiSCs . It has perhaps been unhelpful to use the descriptor ‘‘human ESCs’’ for cells that are so different from the well - deﬁned mouse paradigm . Indeed , it is now argued that these human cells are analogous to rodent EpiSCs ( Brons et al . , 2007 ; Rossant , 2008 ; Tesar et al . , 2007 ) . Yet , EpiSCs are ob - tained from postimplantation epiblasts , whereas human ‘‘ESCs’’ are derived from cultured blastocysts . As argued above , embryo cells may continue to progress in culture such that human blastocyst cells may reach postimplantation epiblast status from which EpiSCs can be derived . But why should this transition occur in primate embryo cultures when rodent embryos produce ESCs rather than EpiSCs ? Species Restriction to Propagation of Ground State Pluripotency ? Ever since the ﬁrst ESCs were derived from mouse blastocysts , strenuous efforts have been made to establish pluripotent stem cell lines from other mammals . These attempts have , in general , been unsuccessful . Until recently , true ESCs had only been vali - dated in the mouse . By inspiration or serendipity , strain 129 was among those chosen for early attempts at mouse ESC derivation ( Evans and Kaufman , 1981 ) . It transpires that ESCs can be derived from 129 embryos more readily than from any other mouse strain ( Gardner and Brook , 1997 ) . Substrains of 129 exhibit an elevated tendency to develop testicular carcinomas , but it remains unclear whether this susceptibility has any connection with the propensity to yield ESCs . Despite a range of protocols , it remained difﬁcult or even impossible to derive stable chimera - competent ESC lines from most mouse strains . The problem may simply be activation of the Erk pathway by endogenous factors such as Fgf4 and by serum components . Serum - free culture with inhibition of Mek and Gsk3 has facili - tated derivation of ESCs from a range of mouse strains tested ( Ying et al . , 2008 ) . Most signiﬁcantly , application of these ground state culture conditions has broken the species barrier . Rat ESCs capable of chimera contribution and germline transmis - sion have ﬁnally been derived ( Buehr et al . , 2008 ; Li et al . , 2008 ) . Nonetheless , unless or until the derivation of true ESCs from human or other primate embryos can be veriﬁed , the validity of the ground state hypothesis is open to question . A pertinent issue here is that rats and mice share an unusual method of early development . After formation of the blastocyst , other mamma - lian embryos do not form an egg cylinder , but instead , the epiblast delaminates as a simple ﬂattened structure called the embryonic disc . During formation of the rodent egg cylinder , the epiblast cells must reorganize from a ball of cells into a cup - shaped epithelium surrounded by hypoblast . This process requires directed apoptosis of the internal epiblast cells ( Cou - couvanis and Martin , 1999 ) . These events may present a hurdle to progression out of naive pluripotency in rodent embryo explants that extends the window for derivation of ESCs . Conversely , in nonrodent embryo cultures , there may be no barrier to progression to primed epiblasts , and the opportunity for capturing the transient ground state may be minimal . A second consideration that may mitigate against ESC deriva - tion from primates is diapause . This is a state of arrested embry - onic development that occurs naturally in rodents and can be induced experimentally by lowering circulating estrogen to prevent the uterus becoming receptive for implantation . In diapause , embryos arrest synchronously at the late blastocyst stage after segregation of epiblast and hypoblast ( Figure 2 ) . Cell division is greatly reduced , indicating that pluripotency is not intrinsically associated with rapid replication . However , some cell turnover does occur . Therefore , the naive epiblast seems to have an intrinsic facility for self - renewal in these 490 Cell Stem Cell 4 , June 5 , 2009 ª 2009 Elsevier Inc . Cell Stem Cell Perspective species . Intriguingly , gene deletion studies have revealed an absolute requirement for Lif / Stat3 signaling in the epiblast during diapause ( Nichols et al . , 2001 ) . This is a facultative situation , however , because the pathway is dispensable for development without diapause . It is conceivable that the facility for epiblast self - renewal in diapause provides the biological foundation for ex vivo propagation of ground state epiblast . If so , ESC deriva - tion may be more problematic in mammals that do not exhibit diapause , in particular if epiblasts in those species are , in conse - quence , unresponsive to Lif / Stat3 . Molecular Requirements for Creating the Naive Ground State While many genes are important for viability of early embryos , two transcriptional regulators are speciﬁcally associated with establishing and maintaining the pluripotent compartment . These factors are the homeodomain containing proteins Oct4 and Nanog . Oct4 is a POU domain transcription factor . It is expressed in the ovum prior to fertilisation , and zygotic transcrip - tion from the late 2 - cell stage results in distribution to all cells during cleavage . After blastocyst formation Oct4 is gradually downregulated in the trophoblast ( Palmieri et al . , 1994 ) . In the late blastocyst Oct4 protein can be detected in all cells of the epiblast . It is also expressed transiently in the hypoblast , but is absent from all extraembryonic cells after implantation ( Palmieri et al . , 1994 ) . Thus , expression of Oct4 becomes progressively restricted to the pluripotent compartment . Clearly , however , Oct4 is expressed more broadly than in the epiblast and there - fore alone cannot be sufﬁcient to specify those cells that will become pluripotent . Expression of Nanog is more tightly correlated with the nascent epiblast ( Chambers et al . , 2003 ) . Nanog protein is not maternally inherited , but ﬁrst appears in a seemingly random cellular distribution at compaction ( Dietrich and Hiiragi , 2007 ) . As the blastocyst develops , Nanog becomes conﬁned to the ICM , though apparently not in all cells . Mosaic distribution in the early ICM is suggested to be reciprocal to the distribution of Gata6 , a marker that is later speciﬁc to the hypoblast ( Cha - zaud et al . , 2006 ) . Traditionally it has been considered that epiblast versus hypoblast fates are determined in the late ICM based on internal or surface location , respectively ( Gardner , 1983 ) . The observation of early and mosaic expression of Gata6 has inspired an alternative hypothesis ( Chazaud et al . , 2006 ) . Molecular speciﬁcation in the early ICM may dictate sepa - ration into distinct territories , such that the hypoblast cells sort out to form a cohesive epithelium overlying the epiblast . However , it is also possible that expression of Nanog and Gata6 may ﬂuctuate in the early ICM and not necessarily corre - late with any lineage speciﬁcation . Indeed , chimera experiments show that while single ICM cells have a tendency to contribute to only hypoblast or only epiblast , a fraction of cells do contribute to both ( Chazaud et al . , 2006 ) . Furthermore , a more recent live - imaging study points to reversibility of Gata6 expression and suggests that at least an element of hypoblast induction is based on cell position ( Plusa et al . , 2008 ) . By whichever mechanism the initial segregation is established , in the late blastocyst , hypo - blast and epiblast are topologically and histologically distin - guishable and exhibit coexclusive expression of Gata6 and Nanog , respectively . Oct4 expression is maintained continuously in the egg cylinder epiblast . In contrast , Nanog is transcriptionally downregulated at implantation ( Chambers et al . , 2003 ) . Nanog is then re - ex - pressed in the posterior egg cylinder epiblast ( Hart et al . , 2004 ) . As gastrulation proceeds and the epiblast differentiates , both factors are extinguished in all somatic lineages ( Chambers et al . , 2003 ; Mitsui et al . , 2003 ) . Expression persists in the primor - dial germ cells , however ( Yamaguchi et al . , 2005 ) . Oct4 is absolutely required to establish the developmental capacity of the ICM ( Nichols et al . , 1998 ) . Without Oct4 , superﬁ - cially normal blastocysts form with a substantial ICM , but all the cells assigned to the ICM domain eventually differentiate into trophoblast . Thus , neither hypoblast nor epiblast are produced in the absence of Oct4 . Attention is generally focused on the requirement for Oct4 to produce pluripotent cells . It is note - worthy that internal cells in Oct4 null blastocysts transiently exhibit features of ICM character before converting into tropho - blast ( Nichols et al . , 1998 ) . This observation might indicate that the trophoblast differentiation is secondary to an inability to differentiate into epiblast and hypoblast . The absolute require - ment for Oct4 in ESCs ( Niwa et al . , 2000 ) suggests that it should be essential for progression from ICM to epiblast . Conceivably Oct4 might also be required for hypoblast commitment , given its initial expression in that lineage ( Palmieri et al . , 1994 ) . Gene deletion studies have shown that , like Oct4 , Nanog is dispensable for blastocyst formation but is absolutely required in the ICM ( Mitsui et al . , 2003 ) . The ICM cells do not all differen - tiate into trophoblast , however , pointing to a distinctive function for Nanog compared with Oct4 , consistent with their different expression proﬁles . Interestingly , unlike Oct4 , Nanog is dispens - able once pluripotency has been attained in ESC cultures , although its absence reduces the threshold for differentiation ( Chambers et al . , 2007 ) . We speculate that Nanog has a unique function in creating the ground state and a secondary role in stabilizing self - renewal during diapause and in ESCs ( Silva and Smith , 2008 ) . Conclusions and Perspectives Development from egg to epiblast is a transition from a deter - mined to an uncommitted state . The underlying mechanism for acquiring pluripotency in the mammalian embryo still eludes molecular deﬁnition . Elucidation of this process is not only of intrinsic interest but is likely to inform understanding of molecular reprogramming and induced pluripotent and quasipluripotent states . Indeed , the development of ground state culture condi - tions utilizing small molecule inhibitors of Fgf / Erk and Gsk - 3 signaling has enhanced both derivation of ESCs and reprogram - ming of somatic cells in rodents . A critical question now is whether the ground state of pluripotency is a core feature of mammalian embryogenesis that can allow generic isolation of naive pluripotent stem cells from a range of species , including human .
