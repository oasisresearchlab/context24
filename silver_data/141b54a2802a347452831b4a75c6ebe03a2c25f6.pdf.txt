A common theme underlying various cell – cell fusion events ranging from insects to mammals is the presence of actin - propelled invasive protrusions at the site of fusion , known as the fusogenic synapse 4 – 10 . Such invasive protrusions were first identified as part of an F - actin - enriched podosome - like structure ( PLS ) in Drosophila myoblast fusion 6 , 11 . The PLS is generated by the attacking fusion partner ( fusion - competent myoblast ( FCM ) ) , which drills mul - tiple invasive protrusions into the receiving fusion partner ( muscle founder cell ) to promote cell membrane juxtaposition , fusogen engagement and fusion pore formation 6 , 12 , 8 , 13 , 14 . Although each membrane protrusion has a diameter similar to that of a filopo - dium , these protrusions are mechanically stiffer than filopodia and are capable of triggering myosin II - and spectrin - mediated mecha - nosensitive responses in the receiving cell 15 , 16 . Interestingly , the invasive protrusions are propelled by Arp2 / 3 - mediated branched actin polymerization . How branched actin filaments are organized to generate mechanically stiff membrane protrusions to promote cell fusion is unknown . Dynamin is a large GTPase best known for its role in endo - cytosis . It also regulates the formation and / or function of F - actin - enriched cellular structures , such as podosomes 17 , 18 , inva - dopodia 19 , filopodia 20 , lamellipodia 21 , actin comet tails 22 , 23 , phago - cytic cups 24 and stress fibres 25 . Dynamin contains a G domain that catalyses GTP hydrolysis , three bundle - signalling elements medi - ating protein self - folding , two stalk domains critical for oligomer - ization , a pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain that interacts with phosphatidyl - inositol - 4 , 5 - biphosphate and a proline - rich domain ( PRD ) for SH3 domain interaction and dynamin localization 26 . Dynamin catalyses membrane fission by forming rings / heli - ces around the neck of a budding endocytic vesicle 26 . Within the dynamin helix , each monomer folds upon itself , resulting in its PH domain residing inside the helical turn , with the stalk regions form - ing the backbone , and the G domain at the outer rim 27 , 28 . Although the PRD is relatively unstructured and absent from crystal struc - tures , it is predicted to extend outward of the dynamin helix beyond the G domain 29 . How dynamin interacts with actin remains a widely documented but poorly understood phenomenon . Previous stud - ies suggest that dynamin bundles actin either directly 30 , 31 or indi - Dynamin regulates the dynamics and mechanical strength of the actin cytoskeleton as a multifilament actin - bundling protein Ruihui Zhang 1 , 12 , Donghoon M .

Chen 1 , 3 , 6 ✉ The dynamin GTPase is known to bundle actin filaments , but the underlying molecular mechanism and physiological rele - vance remain unclear . Our genetic analyses revealed a function of dynamin in propelling invasive membrane protrusions dur - ing myoblast fusion in vivo . Using biochemistry , total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy , electron microscopy and cryo - electron tomography , we show that dynamin bundles actin while forming a helical structure . At its full capacity , each dynamin helix captures 12 – 16 actin filaments on the outer rim of the helix . GTP hydrolysis by dynamin triggers disassembly of fully assembled dynamin helices , releasing free dynamin dimers / tetramers and facilitating Arp2 / 3 - mediated branched actin polymerization . The assembly / disassembly cycles of dynamin promote continuous actin bundling to generate mechanically stiff actin super - bundles . Super - resolution and immunogold platinum replica electron microscopy revealed dynamin along actin bundles at the fusogenic synapse . These findings implicate dynamin as a unique multifilament actin - bundling protein that regulates the dynamics and mechanical strength of the actin cytoskeletal network .

The direct binding of actin by dynamin was proposed to antagonize gelsolin - mediated filament capping , thus promoting polymerization at the barbed ends of the actin filaments 30 . The cortactin - mediated dynamin – actin interaction was thought to stabilize and bundle actin 20 , 32 , 33 . In either model , the precise mode and function of dynamin – actin interactions—in particular , how dynamin bundles actin filaments and how GTP hydrolysis by dynamin affects actin cytoskeletal dynamics—remain unclear . Results Dynamin is required for myoblast fusion in vivo and co - localizes with the F - actin foci at the fusogenic synapse . The presence of a PLS at the fusogenic synapse 6 prompted us to examine whether dynamin plays a role in Drosophila myoblast fusion . The single Drosophila dynamin , shibire ( Shi ) , shares 67 % protein sequence identity with human dynamins . Temperature - sensitive ( ts ) alleles of shi ( shi ts1 and shi ts2 ) , each containing a point mutation in the G domain , exhibited a severe myoblast fusion defect at restric - tive temperature ( 34 °C ) ( Fig . 1a , b and Extended Data Fig . 1a – c ) . The unfused , mononucleated myoblasts in these mutant embryos expressed tropomyosin and muscle myosin heavy chain , indicat - ing that they had properly differentiated ( Fig . 1a and Extended Data Fig . 1a , b ) . Expressing wild - type Shi - green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) in all muscle cells or specifically in FCMs , but not in founder cells alone , in shi ts2 mutant embryos substantially rescued myoblast fusion at 34 °C ( Fig . 1b and Extended Data Fig . 1d ) , showing that the fusion defect was caused by the loss of Shi in the FCMs . The homozygous mutant of the dynamin - interacting protein cortac - tin 20 , 32 , 33 is viable as an adult 34 and did not exhibit a fusion defect in embryos ( Extended Data Fig . 1e ) , suggesting that cortactin does not have an essential function in Drosophila myoblast fusion . Consistent with its role in FCMs , the Shi protein co - localized with the FCM - specific F - actin foci at the fusogenic synapse in fixed embryos ( Extended Data Fig . 2a ) . In addition , live imaging of embryos co - expressing GFP - tagged Shi ( Shi – GFP ) and mono - meric red fluorescent protein - tagged Actin ( Actin – mRFP ) in mus - cle cells revealed that Shi co - localized with the F - actin foci during their entire life span and dissolved together with the F - actin foci when fusion was completed ( Fig . 1c and Supplementary Video 1 ) . Recruitment of Shi to the fusogenic synapse depended on the FCM - specific cell adhesion molecule Sns , but not on the actin nucleation - promoting factors and their associated proteins , such as WASP , WASP - interacting protein / Solitary ( Sltr ) and Kette ( in the Scar complex ) 5 , 12 ( Extended Data Fig . 2a – e ) . A general role for Shi in cell – cell fusion was supported by experi - ments in Drosophila S2R + cells ( of haemocyte origin ) induced to fuse 8 by co - expressing Sns and a Caenorhabditis elegans fusogen Eff - 1 , the latter of which resembles a type II virus fusogen required for cell fusion in C . elegans embryos and heterologous cells 8 , 35 – 37 . Knockdown of Shi in Sns - and Eff - 1 - expressing S2R + cells using double - stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) against the 5 ′ untranslated region did not affect Eff - 1 localization or concentration at the fusogenic synapse ( Extended Data Fig . 2h ) , but resulted in a fusion defect , which was substantially rescued by Shi expression ( Fig . 1d – f ) . As in Drosophila embryos , Shi co - localized with the F - actin foci at the fusogenic synapses in S2R + cells ( Fig . 1g and Extended Data Fig . 2i ) . In addition , Shi and F - actin co - localization was observed at actin - propelled protrusions in S2R + cells expressing Sns alone , suggesting a general correlation between Shi and F - actin in these actin - enriched structures ( Extended Data Fig . 2j ) . It is worth not - ing that although dynamin 2 has been implicated in the fusion of cultured mouse myoblasts and osteoclasts , as well as in viral fusogen - induced fusion of insect cells , the underlying mechanisms have remained unclear 9 , 38 – 40 . Dynamin is required for generating invasive protrusions at the fusogenic synapse . Confocal microscopy showed that founder cells were invaded by the FCM - specific PLS with an average depth of 1 . 1 ± 0 . 3 μ m ( n = 67 ) in wild - type embryos ( Fig . 1h , left ) , compared with 0 . 6 ± 0 . 2 μ m ( n = 38 ; P < 0 . 0001 ) in shi ts2 mutant embryos ( Fig . 1h , right ) . Consistent with this , transmission elec - tron microscopy studies revealed that wild - type PLSs projected lon - ger ( 384 . 4 ± 249 . 5 nm ; n = 18 protrusions ) , albeit fewer protrusions ( 3 . 8 ± 1 . 3 ; n = 9 fusogenic synapses ) , compared with 139 . 3 ± 87 . 6 nm ( n = 39 protrusions ; P < 0 . 001 ) and 6 . 7 ± 2 . 2 ( n = 21 fusogenic syn - apses ; P < 0 . 001 ) in shi ts2 mutant embryos ( Fig . 1i ) . In addition , the actin - enriched areas were devoid of ribosomes and intracel - lular organelles such as mitochondria in wild - type , but not in shi ts2 mutant , embryos . Thus , Shi is involved in organizing densely packed Fig . 1 | Shi promotes myoblast fusion by facilitating PLS invasion at the fusogenic synapse . a , Defective myoblast fusion in the shi mutant embryo .

Despite the enrichment of dynamin at the fusogenic synapse , no endocytic pit accumulation was observed at 34 °C ( Fig . 1i ) , as opposed to many that are found at the neuronal synapse 41 .

These data , together with the high cortical tension generated by the actin - propelled protrusions , sug - gest that the likelihood of plasma membrane retrieval by endocytosis at the fusogenic synapse is low and that dynamin may be involved in processes other than endocytosis at these sites . Consistent with this , it has been shown that inhibition of human dynamin 2 ( hDyn2 ) , but not endocytosis , perturbed podosome formation 42 . Dynamin bundles actin filaments by forming regularly spaced rings / helices in vitro . The co - localization of Shi with the actin structures and its role in promoting invasive protrusions prompted us to investigate the potential interaction between Shi and actin . Low - speed F - actin co - sedimentation assays revealed that purified Shi bundled F - actin in a concentration - dependent manner under low - ionic - strength conditions ( 50 mM KCl ) known to allow the formation of higher - order structures of dynamin , such as rings and helices 43 , 44 ( Fig . 2a and Extended Data Fig . 3a ) . In addition , high - speed co - sedimentation assays showed that Shi bound actin ( Extended Data Fig . 3b ) with a K d of 0 . 19 ± 0 . 03 μ M ( Extended Data Fig . 3c , d ) , similar to that of the hDyn1 – actin interaction ( ~ 0 . 4 μ M ) 30 . Using total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy , we observed that both linear actin filaments ( in the absence of Arp2 / 3 ) and branched actin filaments ( in the presence of Arp2 / 3 ) formed thick actin bundles when Shi or SNAP - tagged Shi ( Shi – SNAP ) was added to the actin polymerization reaction ( Fig . 2b , c ) . Strikingly , Shi appeared to rapidly freeze the dynamically polym - erizing branched actin network and crosslink the entire network by forming actin bundles at numerous locations ( Supplementary Video 2 ) . The Shi – actin bundles were straighter compared to single actin filaments , as measured by their convolutedness , indi - cating that they were mechanically stiffer ( Fig . 2d ) . In fact , the Shi – actin bundles were sufficiently stiff to preclude measurement of mechanical properties by observing their thermally induced fluc - tuations . At the single - filament level , Shi - induced actin bundling could occur between two well - formed actin filaments ( Fig . 2e and Supplementary Video 3 ) or between a founding filament and addi - tional ones that were being polymerized alongside ( Fig . 2f , g and Supplementary Video 4 ) . Negative - stain electron microscopy revealed that Shi formed reg - ularly spaced , lighter coloured bands along the actin bundles when Shi and actin were mixed at equal concentrations ( 1 μ M ; Fig . 2h , top two images ) . The average distance between the Shi bands was 15 . 1 ± 1 . 8 nm ( n = 401 ) , comparable to the average pitch of Shi helices around lipid nanotubes ( 15 . 3 ± 1 . 6 nm ; n = 418 ) ( Fig . 2h – j ) . We temporarily refer to the Shi bands as Shi rings , although it was unclear at this resolution whether Shi formed individual rings or helices . In addition to single actin bundles , super - bundles were also observed in which two , three or more actin bundles aligned in parallel , each of which could be distinguished by the slightly out - of - sync Shi rings ( Fig . 2h , third and fourth images ) . Occasionally , the Shi rings appeared more in sync across multiple actin bundles ( Fig . 2h , bottom image ) . The average outer diameter of an actin bundle was 32 . 0 ± 3 . 6 nm ( n = 259 ) , similar to that of Shi rings alone ( 31 . 3 ± 2 . 9 nm ; n = 282 ) ( Fig . 2h , k , l ) , but smaller than that of Shi helices surrounding membrane nanotubes ( 50 . 7 ± 3 . 3 nm ; n = 252 ) ( Fig . 2j , l ) , suggesting that Shi rings may interact differently with actin filaments versus mem - brane tubules . At a lower Shi concentration ( 0 . 125 μ M ) , Shi rings occupied isolated segments along the actin bundle and appeared to be arranged in doublets ( Fig . 2m ) . The average distance between the two Shi rings in a doublet was 16 . 3 ± 2 . 5 nm ( n = 315 ) , and that between two doublets was 20 . 2 ± 1 . 6 nm ( n = 189 ) ( Fig . 2i , m ) . Interestingly , the sum of the two distances ( ~ 36 . 5 nm ) largely coincided with a half helical pitch of actin ( 36 nm ) . Such characteristic spacing of Shi rings at a low Shi concentration sug - gests the existence of high - affinity binding sites for Shi on the actin filaments . Like Drosophila Shi , hDyn1 and hDyn2 also formed regularly spaced rings that directly bundled actin , as shown by negative - stain electron microscopy ( Fig . 3a , top three images for hDyn1 and top two images for hDyn2 ) . The average distances between the hDyn1 and hDyn2 rings along the actin bundle ( 15 . 6 ± 1 . 4 nm ( n = 307 ) and 15 . 4 ± 1 . 4 nm ( n = 245 ) , respectively ; Fig . 3a , b ) were similar to the average pitch of hDyn1 helices around nanotubes ( 15 . 4 ± 1 . 7 nm ; n = 252 ; Fig . 3b , e ) . Moreover , the average outer diameter of the hDyn1 rings along the actin bundles ( 44 . 7 ± 3 . 0 nm ; Fig . 2 | Shi bundles actin filaments . a , Shi bundles actin filaments in a dose - dependent manner . 3 μ M actin was incubated with increasing concentrations of Shi .

Shi AKE was expressed at a lower level than wild - type Shi in S2R + cells , suggest - ing that the mutant protein is unstable ( Extended Data Fig . 3e , f ) . Despite this , the small amount of purified Shi AKE was able to bun - dle actin , albeit lacking the characteristic Shi rings along the actin bundle ( Extended Data Fig . 3g ) . These results suggest that the AKE mutations may affect Shi’s normal assembly to form higher - order structures and that Shi interacts with actin using other domain ( s ) . Surprisingly , a Shi mutant carrying a deletion of the PH domain ( Shi Δ PH ) bound and bundled actin as effectively as wild - type Shi ( Fig . 4a , b and Extended Data Fig . 4a , b ) , even though Shi Δ PH failed to form helices around lipid nanotubes as predicted ( Extended Data Fig . 4c ) . Thus , the PH domain is not required for Shi – actin interac - tion and Shi does not appear to wrap actin filaments in the middle of the rings . Deleting the PRD domain ( Shi Δ PRD ) decreased Shi’s actin - binding and - bundling activities , as shown by high - / low - speed co - sedimentation assays ( Extended Data Fig . 4a , b ) . Consistent with this , negative - stain electron microscopy revealed that Shi Δ PRD failed to organize actin filaments into tight bundles ( Fig . 4b ) , despite forming normal helices around lipid nanotubes ( Extended Data Fig . 4c ) . Since PRD is known for SH3 interaction , we tested whether isolated SH3 domains would interfere with the PRD – actin interaction . Although SH3 domains compromised the Shi – actin interaction , a substantial portion of Shi remained in the pellet in the high - speed sedimentation assay , suggesting that the PRD can accommodate interactions with SH3 domains and actin simultaneously ( Extended Data Fig . 4d ) . hDyn2 Δ PRD also exhibited decreased activities in actin binding and bundling , dem - onstrating a conserved function of PRD in the dynamin – actin interaction ( Fig . 3f , g ) . Notably , deleting the G domain ( Shi Δ G ) also decreased Shi’s actin - bundling activity , albeit to a lesser extent than deleting the PRD ( Extended Data Fig . 4a , b ) . Negative - stain elec - tron microscopy revealed that Shi Δ G could bundle actin to some extent ( probably due to the presence of the PRD ) without forming regularly spaced rings ( Fig . 4b ) . Taken together , these results sug - gest that the PRD is the primary actin - binding domain in dynamin and that the G domain may play a minor role in facilitating PRD in bundling actin and / or in enhancing ring assembly to position the PRDs for efficient actin binding . To test whether the PRD is sufficient for actin binding / bundling , we purified the Shi PRD and a tandem repeat of PRD ( 2 × PRD ) . 2 × PRD exhibited higher actin - binding / - bundling activity than that of PRD ( Extended Data Fig . 4e , f ) , and 2 × PRD organized tight actin bundles despite not forming regularly spaced rings ( Fig . 4c ) . Similarly , the 2 × PRD of both hDyn1 and hDyn2 also bundled actin filaments ( Fig . 3h ) . Therefore , PRD binds actin and the tan - dem PRD functions as an artificial two - filament actin crosslinker . Furthermore , fusing the Shi PRD domain to the carboxy terminus of Drosophila dynamin - related protein 1 ( Drp1 ) , which is required for mitochondrial fission 45 and does not contain a PRD ( Fig . 4a ) , con - verts Drp1 from a weak to a strong actin - bundling protein , as dem - onstrated by the tight actin bundles organized by regularly spaced Drp1 – Shi PRD rings ( Fig . 4d and Extended Data Fig . 5a ) . Consistent with this , Drp1 – Shi PRD , but not Drp1 , partially rescued the fusion defect in Sns - and Eff - 1 - expressing Shi knockdown cells ( Extended Data Fig . 5b ) . The partial rescue may be due to the requirement of a higher concentration of Drp1 – Shi PRD than that of Shi to orga - nize tight actin bundles ( Extended Data Fig . 5a ) . Consistent with this , overexpressing Drp1 – Shi PRD , which was enriched at the fuso - genic synapse ( Extended Data Fig . 5c ) , exhibited a dominant nega - tive effect in wild - type cell fusion , presumably by interfering with the function of endogenous Shi ( Extended Data Fig . 5b ) . Taken together , these results demonstrate that the PRD is the primary actin - binding domain in dynamin . Point mutations in the PRD are required for actin bundling . To gain further insight into the PRD – actin interaction , we mutated four highly conserved , positively charged Arg residues ( R804 , 829 , 846 and 853 ) to negatively charged Asp in the Shi PRD ( Fig . 4e ) . While the single mutants ( Shi R804D and Shi R829D ) and the double mutant ( Shi R846 / 853D ) did not affect the Shi – actin interaction , the quadruple mutant ( Shi R804 / 829 / 846 / 853D or Shi 4RD ) exhibited a substantial decrease in actin binding / bundling ( Fig . 4f and Extended Data Fig . 5d , e ) . Furthermore , Shi 4RD , but not the single or double mutants , failed to rescue the fusion defect in Sns - and Eff - 1 - expressing Shi knock - down cells ( Fig . 4g , h ) , despite co - localizing with the F - actin foci at the fusogenic synapse ( Extended Data Fig . 6a ) . The normal local - ization of the Shi mutants was probably mediated by PxxP – SH3 domain interactions , because most of the PxxP motifs in the PRD were not disrupted by the mutations ( Fig . 4e ) . Although Shi 4RD was unable to rescue cell fusion ( Fig . 4g , h ) , it partially rescued the endo - cytosis defect in Shi knockdown cells ( Fig . 4i and Extended Data Fig . 6b ) , supporting a potential role for dynamin - mediated actin bundling in endocytosis . Multiple actin filaments are associated with the outer rim of the dynamin helix . The specific PRD – actin interaction suggests that actin filaments are likely to be attached to the outer rim of the dynamin ring where the PRD resides .

NATuRE CELL BioLoGY | VOL 22 | JUNE 2020 | 674 – 688 | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology 679 Articles Nature Cell Biology electron microscopy revealed stretches of naked actin filaments running along the outer rim of the Shi rings at a low Shi concentra - tion ( 0 . 125 μ M ) ( Fig . 5a , top ) . Occasionally , the actin filaments were not bundled by dynamin at the ends . Such split ends allowed us to discern at least eight actin filaments within a Shi – actin bundle ( Fig . 5a , bottom ) . To achieve a higher - resolution view of the dynamin – actin bundles , we performed cryo - electron tomography ( cryo - ET ) using hDyn1 ( or Shi ) with actin . Cryo - ET revealed that hDyn1 assembled as a helix with actin filaments attached to the outer rim ( Fig . 5c – f , Extended Data Fig . 7a , b and Supplementary Video 5 – 8 ) .

The hDyn1 bands on the top section had a right - handed tilt , whereas the corresponding hDyn1 bands on the bottom section exhibited a left - handed tilt ( Fig . 5d , Extended Data Fig . 7a and Supplementary Video 6 ) . The middle section contained T - shaped structures characteristic of dynamin helices ( Fig . 5d , Extended Data Fig . 7a and Supplementary Video 6 ) . Based on the outer diameter ( 42 nm ) and the pitch ( 16 . 8 nm ) of the hDyn1 helix observed by cryo - ET , we modelled the hDyn1 helix and positioned the actin filaments based on the tomogram ( Fig . 5e , f and Extended Data Fig . 7b ) . Since the length per turn ( L ) of the hDyn1 helix was 133 nm ( L = ( C 2 + H 2 ) 0 . 5 , where C is the circumference and H is the height or pitch ) and the distance between hDyn1 dimers was 8 . 3 nm , based on the high - resolution Cryo - ET map of hDyn1 46 , we determined that there were ~ 16 hDyn1 dimers per turn ( 133 nm divided by 8 . 3 nm ) of the hDyn1 helix along the actin bundle , which correlated with the helical parameters of a 22 . 5° twist and 10 . 5 Å rise between dimers . Segmentation of a particular actin bundle orga - nized by the hDyn1 helix revealed 11 actin filaments associated with the outer rim ( Fig . 5f , Extended Data Fig . 7b and Supplementary Video 6 – 8 ) , corresponding to a partially occupied hDyn1 helix in which 11 of the 16 dimers per helical turn engaged with actin filaments . Similarly , Drosophila Shi was also assembled as a helix , the outer rim of which engaged actin filaments ( Extended Data Fig . 7c , d and Supplementary Video 9 ) . The Shi helix was narrower than that of hDyn1 and contained 12 Shi dimers per turn , based on the outer diameter ( 32 nm ) and the helical pitch ( 15 . 1 nm ) . The eight - filament bundle shown in Fig . 5a is therefore a partially occu - pied Shi helix . Taken together , each dynamin - mediated actin bun - dle consists of a centrally localized dynamin helix and multiple actin filaments attached to its outer rim . Interestingly , when lipid nano - tubes were added to the Shi / actin mix , the nanotubes were wrapped by Shi helices in the centre , with the actin filaments captured at the outer rim ( Fig . 5b ) . This result suggests that the dynamin - mediated endocytosis and actin bundling are not mutually exclusive . GTP hydrolysis of dynamin disassembles the dynamin heli - ces and loosens the actin bundles . All of the above experiments were performed in the absence of GTP , which is an energy mol - ecule contained in every cell . To investigate how dynamin bun - dles actin filaments in vivo , we first examined how GTP affected dynamin - mediated actin bundling with purified proteins . Structured illumination microscopy ( SIM ) revealed that GTP addi - tion decreased the amount of Shi – SNAP associated with the actin super - bundles , leaving sparsely localized Shi – SNAP punctae ( Fig . 6a ) . Under electron microscope , most of the Shi helices appeared to be disassembled upon GTP addition , resulting in loose actin bun - dles largely held together by some residual Shi helices ( Fig . 6b , d ) . Consistent with this , low - speed co - centrifugation assay showed that Shi bundled actin in the presence of GTP ( Extended Data Fig . 3h ) . Similar to Shi , hDyn1 and hDyn2 helices along actin bundles were disassembled upon GTP addition , resulting in loosened actin bundles ( Fig . 3a , bottom images for hDyn1 and hDyn2 ) . In contrast , point mutations in the Shi G domain that disable GTP hydrolysis , such as Shi Q35E ( corresponding to hDyn1 Q40E ; Fig . 6b ) , Shi G141S ( Drosophila ts2 mutant ; hDyn1 G146S ; Fig . 6c ) and Shi K137A ( hDyn1 K142A ; Fig . 6b ) , completely or partially blocked GTP - induced Shi helix disassembly and actin bundle dissociation in the presence of GTP ( at the restrictive temperature for Shi G141S ) . Similarly , both Shi Δ PH and a point mutation in the PH domain ( Shi I527A ; hDyn1 I533A ) bundled actin normally but blocked GTP - dependent Shi helix dis - assembly and actin bundle dissociation ( Fig . 6b ) . The GTPase activ - ity of Shi Δ PH remained similar to that of Shi ( Fig . 7a – d ) , suggesting that the PH domain is involved in conformational changes required for Shi helix disassembly upon GTP hydrolysis . GTP hydrolysis triggers dynamic assembly / disassembly of dyna - min and actin filament bundling . To examine the dynamics of Shi helices along the actin bundles , we performed fluorescence recov - ery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) analyses . Substantial fluorescence recovery was observed after photobleaching a stretch of fluores - cently labelled Shi helix in the presence of GTP ( 52 . 0 ± 16 . 9 % ) , but not in the absence of GTP ( 7 . 7 ± 8 . 9 % ) ( Fig . 6e , f and Supplementary Video 10 ) , suggesting that GTP hydrolysis triggered the disassem - bly of photobleached Shi helices and allowed the reassembly of new helices . Thus , in the presence of GTP , Shi cycles between assembled helices along the actin bundles and disassembled dimers / tetra - mers in the solution . Interestingly , Shi’s GTPase activity increased ~ 12 - fold when it was pre - assembled along the actin filaments ( Fig . 7a , b , e , f ) , presumably due to the G – G domain interactions between the helical turns , as shown for hDyn1 helices around lipid nanotubes 47 . Therefore , once Shi assembles into a complete helix , it will be rapidly disassembled upon GTP hydrolysis . Time - lapse imaging showed that GTP addition into a pre - incubated Shi / actin mix rapidly disassembled most , if not all , of the fully assembled Shi helices and released the actin filaments back into the solution ( Fig . 6g and Supplementary Video 11 ) . Some actin filaments in the solution were re - bundled by Shi and released again upon additional GTP hydrolysis , presum - ably after the dynamin helices were fully assembled ( Fig . 6g and Supplementary Video 11 ) , and such bundling / dissociation cycles continued ( Fig . 6g and Supplementary Video 11 ) . Taken together , the GTP hydrolysis - mediated cycling of Shi between helices and dimers / tetramers leads to dynamic bundling and dissociation of the actin filaments .

Synchronized disassembly of Shi helices upon GTP addition can only occur in vitro when Shi helices are fully assembled along the actin bundles . However , when the amount of Shi is limited , such as in vivo , actin filaments are bundled by both fully and partially assembled Shi helices , resulting in unsynchronized dis - assembly of Shi helices along the actin bundles in the presence of GTP .

Moreover , the new short actin filaments could be further bundled by Shi ( Fig . 6i and Supplementary Video 14 ) . Similarly , disassembly of hDyn1 helices upon GTP addition also led to robust Arp2 / 3 - mediated branched actin polymerization ( Extended Data Fig . 8d , e and Supplementary Video 15 ) . Thus , GTP hydrolysis by fully assembled dynamin helices exposes new sites for branched actin polymerization to maintain the dynamics of the actin cytoskeletal network . Dynamin bundles actin filaments in vivo . A major question regarding dynamin – actin interaction is whether dynamin bundles actin in vivo . Results from our in vitro analyses predict that only partially , but not fully , assembled dynamin helices may be observed in vivo due to the presence of GTP in the cytosol and unsynchro - nized GTP hydrolysis . Indeed , super - resolution microscopy ( SIM and stimulated emission depletion ( STED ) ) revealed sparse Shi punctae along the actin bundles at the fusogenic synapse in Sns - and Eff - 1 - expressing S2R + cells ( Fig . 8a and Extended Data Fig . 9a ) . In Shi knockdown cells expressing Shi Q35E , more Shi punctae were observed along the actin bundles ( Fig . 8b ) , consistent with the inhibition of Shi helix disassembly by the GTP hydrolysis mutant ( Fig . 6b , c ) . To ask whether dynamin exhibits a similar pat - tern of localization on other actin - enriched structures , we examined hDyn2 on actin comet tails , which are membrane - less Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin structures induced by the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes . Indeed , similar punctate hDyn2 localiza - tion was observed on actin comet tails in HeLa cells ( Extended Data Fig . 9e , f ) . To visualize Shi on actin bundles at the ultrastructural level , we performed immunogold labelling of Shi with platinum replica electron microscopy ( PREM ) . In membrane - extracted Shi knock - down S2R + cells expressing Sns , Eff - 1 and Shi – GFP , tight actin super - bundles were observed at the fusogenic synapse extending towards the fusion partner ( Fig . 8c – e and Extended Data Fig . 9b ) .

NATuRE CELL BioLoGY | VOL 22 | JUNE 2020 | 674 – 688 | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology 683 Articles Nature Cell Biology Gold - labelled Shi – GFP localized sparsely , but specifically , on the actin bundles ( Fig . 8c ) , which could be an under - representation of Shi because of the inaccessibility of some GFP epitopes within the tight actin bundles and the residual endogenous Shi that was unlabelled . Applying a point spread function - like mask of ~ 110 nm on each gold particle revealed matching patterns of Shi localization ( Fig . 8c , d , bottom right image in each panel ) between immunogold PREM and SIM / STED imaging ( Fig . 8a , b and Extended Data Fig . 9a ) , validating the specificity of both methods . Furthermore , immu - nogold labelling of Shi Q35E ( or Shi ts2 at restrictive temperature ) in Shi knockdown cells revealed more clustering of gold particles along the actin bundles than that of wild - type Shi ( Fig . 8d , e and Extended Data Fig . 9c , d ) , consistent with the inhibition of Shi helix disassem - bly by these GTP hydrolysis mutants . Occasionally , large clusters of gold particles were observed on the actin bundles ( Fig . 8e ) . A cluster with a width of ~ 100 nm may represent a Shi ring / helix , based on the diameter of the Shi helix and the sizes of antibodies / gold par - ticles ( Fig . 8e ) . Taken together , these data are consistent with the dynamic assembly / disassembly of dynamin along the actin bundles in the presence of GTP , and strongly suggest that dynamin bundles actin filaments in vivo . Dynamic disassembly of dynamin helices is required for cell – cell fusion . Finally , we tested whether disassembly of Shi helices is required for cell – cell fusion by performing rescue experiments in S2R + cells co - expressing Sns , Eff - 1 and Shi dsRNA . The G domain mutants Shi Q35E and Shi K137A and the ts2 allele ( at restrictive tem - perature ) failed to rescue the cell fusion defect in Shi knockdown cells ( Fig . 6j , k ) . In addition , overexpression of Shi Q35E in Sns - and Eff - 1 - expresssing wild - type S2R + cells caused a strong dominant negative effect on cell – cell fusion , whereas Shi K137A had a weaker dominant negative effect ( Fig . 6j ) , corresponding to the partial dis - assembly of the Shi K137A helices in the presence of GTP ( Fig . 6b ) . Consistent with a defect in helix disassembly , Shi I527A also failed to rescue the cell – cell fusion defect in Shi knockdown cells , and caused a dominant negative effect on cell – cell fusion when expressed in wild - type cells ( Fig . 6j ) . These results show that the dynamic disas - sembly of dynamin is required for cell – cell fusion . Discussion In this study , we investigated how dynamin bundles actin and how GTP hydrolysis by dynamin regulates actin cytoskeletal dynamics to promote invasive protrusions in cell fusion . Our genetic , bio - chemical , TIRF microscopy , single - filament imaging , negative - stain electron microscopy , cryo - ET and PREM studies have led to the fol - lowing model ( Extended Data Fig . 10a , b ) . During dynamin’s assem - bly into a helical structure , actin filaments are bundled to the outer rim of the partially assembled dynamin helices via the PRD domain . Once a dynamin helix is fully assembled , the assembly - stimulated GTPase activity of dynamin triggers rapid GTP hydrolysis and helix disassembly , freeing dynamin dimers / tetramers to bundle new actin filaments ( Extended Data Fig . 10a ) . Since each actin super - bundle consists of multiple dynamin helices that are being assembled , the asynchronous GTP hydrolysis results in a hybrid actin bundle that contains stretches of unprotected filaments held together at random locations by partial dynamin helices . The unprotected stretches of the actin bundle become new sites for Arp2 / 3 - mediated branched actin polymerization , to generate short actin filaments more suit - able for mechanical work 13 . The new actin filaments can either form new bundles de novo or join pre - existing actin bundles via actin – PRD interactions . Thus , through dynamin’s cycling between helix assembly and disassembly as a function of GTP hydrolysis , the actin bundles grow thicker and mechanically stiffer by incorporating and bundling numerous short filaments . As a consequence , the PLS at the fusogenic synapse is able to propel membrane protrusions to promote cell – cell fusion ( Extended Data Fig . 10b ) . In contrast , the disassembly - defective dynamin mutants remain bound to actin bundles , leaving few free dynamin proteins available to bundle new actin filaments , and partially blocking Arp2 / 3 - mediated branched actin polymerization . Both of these events reduce the mechanical strength of the actin network , resulting in stubby protrusions at the fusogenic synapses in shi ts2 mutant embryos . Continuous actin polymerization organized by the nucleation - promoting factors in the vicinity , in turn , generates additional stubby protrusions at the fusogenic synapse ( Fig . 1h , i ) . Our study establishes dynamin as a unique actin - bundling pro - tein .

In contrast , dynamin is a multifilament bundling protein by forming a helical structure that can engage 16 ( hDyn1 ) or 12 ( Shi ) actin filaments at its full capacity ( Extended Data Fig . 10a ) . Due to the tilt of the dynamin dimers along the long axis of the actin bundle , each actin filament is bound by two PRDs from two different dimers in each turn of a dynamin helix . By interacting with more PRDs from additional turns along the dynamin helix , the multifilament actin bundle is further stabilized .

The unique mode of dyna - min – actin interaction makes dynamin a powerful actin - bundling pro - tein that enhances the mechanical strength of the actin network . We propose that the mechanisms underlying dynamin – actin interaction uncovered in this study will be generally applicable to other cellular processes involving dynamin - mediated actin cytoskeletal rearrange - ments , such as the formation and function of podosomes , invadopo - dia and comet tails , as well as the fission of endocytic vesicles .

For phenotypic analyses of embryos carrying shi ts1 or shi ts2 mutations , shi ts embryos were collected for 1 h at 20 °C , incubated at permissive temperature ( 18 °C ) for 16 h to allow the specification and proliferation of muscle cells , shifted to the restrictive temperature ( 34 °C ) for 4 h , and washed and dechorionated in buffers pre - warmed to 34 °C before fixation and staining . To generate Cortactin maternal zygotic null mutant embryos , homozygous Cortactin M7 female flies were crossed to Cortactin 6A2 males . Cell culture . S2R + cells were cultured in Schneider’s medium ( Gibco ) supplemented with 10 % foetal bovine serum ( Gibco ) and penicillin / streptomycin ( Sigma – Aldrich ) . S2R + cells were induced to fuse as previously described 8 . Briefly , 1 . 2 × 10 6 cells were plated in each well of a 6 - well plate and transfected with Sns and Eff - 1 constructs ( 200 ng each ) using Effectene ( Qiagen ) , per the manufacturer’s instructions . Transfected cells were fixed after 48 or 72 h for phenotypic analyses . For Shi RNA RNAi knockdown experiments , cells were incubated with 3 µ g ml − 1 dsRNA for 4 d , transfected with the appropriate DNA constructs , then incubated again with 3 µ g ml − 1 dsRNA for 48 – 72 h .

For SIM imaging , the following labelling reagents were used : rabbit anti - HA antibody ( 1 : 600 ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ; 715500 ) , Alexa Fluor 647 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit antibody ( 1 : 600 ; Invitrogen ) and Alexa Fluor 568 - phalloidin ( 1 : 200 ; Sigma – Aldrich ) . For STED imaging , the following labelling reagents were used : rabbit anti - HA antibody ( 1 : 600 ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ; 715500 ) , mouse anti - GFP antibody ( 1 : 600 ; DSHB ; 8H11 ) , CF405M - conjugated goat anti - rabbit antibody ( 1 : 600 ; Biotium ) , Star580 - conjugated goat anti - mouse antibody ( 1 : 600 ; Abberior ) and StarRed - phalloidin ( 1 : 200 ; Abberior ) . To visualize hDyn2 localization along actin bundles on comet tails ( Extended Data Fig . 9e , f ) , 4 . 5 × 10 5 HeLa cells were seeded onto 25 - mm glass coverslips ( Warner Instruments ; 64 - 0715 ) deposited in 6 - well plates the day before infection . GFP - expressing L . monocytogenes strain 10403s ( provided by D . Portnoy , University of California , Berkeley ) was cultured in 3 ml brain heart infusion media ( Gibco ) at 30 °C overnight without shaking until an optical density at an absorbance , measured at 600 nm , of 0 . 8 was reached . The following day , 1 ml Listeria culture was centrifuged at 16 , 000 g for 1 min , washed with PBS , and resuspended in a final volume of 1 ml PBS . HeLa cells were infected with Listeria at a multiplicity of infection of 60 , and infection was synchronized by centrifugation for 10 min at 800 g . The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 90 min and washed with PBS , followed by another incubation in fresh media containing 50 µ g ml − 1 gentamicin for 5 h . HeLa cells were washed twice with PBS + + , then fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde diluted in cytoskeleton preservation buffer for 10 min at 37 °C ( ref . 67 ) . Samples were washed in PBS , permeabilized and incubated in PBSBT , followed by immunostaining . The following labelling reagents were used : mouse anti - hDyn2 ( 1 : 50 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ; G4 ) , Star580 - conjugated goat anti - mouse antibody ( 1 : 600 ; Abberior ) and StarRed - conjugated phalloidin ( 1 : 200 ; Abberior ) . SIM imaging was performed using a Nikon N - SIM E microscope ( Ti - E ) equipped with a CFI SR Apochromat TIRF 100 × / 1 . 49 oil objective lens and an ORCA - Flash 4 . 0 sCMOS camera ( Hamamatsu Photonics K . K . ) . Excitation of the fluorophores was performed with three lasers ( 488 , 561 and 640 nm ) . STED imaging was performed using an Abberior Instruments Expert Line STED microscope ( Abberior Instruments ) equipped with an SLM - based easy3D module , an Olympus IX83 microscope body and an UPLSAPO 100 × / 1 . 4 oil objective . Excitation of the fluorophores was performed with pulsed excitation lasers at 561 and 640 nm . A pulsed 775 - nm laser ( pulse width : ~ 1 . 2 ns ) was used for STED . Both excitation and STED lasers were synchronized and operated at 40 MHz . Time - gated detection of the fluorescence was performed at 605 – 625 nm for the orange channel and 650 – 720 nm for the far - red channel . The images were processed using Adobe Photoshop CS6 and ImageJ ( NIH ) software . Immunogold PREM . To visualize Shi localization along actin bundles at the fusogenic synapse at the ultrastructural level , 1 . 2 × 10 6 Shi knockdown S2R + cells were seeded and transfected using Effectene ( Qiagen ) with pAc - Eff - 1 - FLAG ( 175 ng ) , pAc - Sns - iBlueberry - T2A - HO1 ( 175 ng ) and various Shi constructs : ( 1 ) pUAST - Shi - GFP ( or pUAST - Shi Q35E - GFP ) ( 100 ng ) and pUbi - Gal4 ( 100 ng ) ; or ( 2 ) pAc - Shi ts2 - 3 × HA ( 200 ng ) . For membrane extraction , cells on glass coverslips were rinsed twice in PBS + + and incubated in extraction solution containing 1 % Triton X - 100 , 4 % polyethylene glycol ( or PEG ) , 2 µ M unlabelled phalloidin ( Sigma – Aldrich ; P2141 ) and 2 µ M taxol ( Sigma – Aldrich ; T7402 ) in PEM buffer ( 100 mM PIPES − KOH ( pH 6 . 9 ) , 1 mM MgCl 2 and 1 mM EGTA ) for 4 min . Membrane - extracted cells were fixed with 0 . 2 % glutaraldehyde ( Ted Pella ; 18426 ) prepared in PEM buffer at room temperature for 30 min . Immunogold staining and platinum replica sample processing were performed as described previously 68 , 69 . For immunogold staining , the fixed cells were quenched with 2 mg ml − 1 NaBH 4 in PBS twice for 10 min each and blocked with 1 % BSA in PBS for 20 min . The cells were then incubated with rabbit anti - HA ( Sigma – Aldrich ; H6908 ) or anti - GFP ( Invitrogen ; G10362 ) antibody diluted 1 : 50 in PEM buffer for 1 h . The samples were washed in immunogold buffer containing 0 . 5 M NaCl , 0 . 05 % Tween 20 and 0 . 05 % sodium azide in 20 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) and incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with 18 - nm colloidal gold ( Jackson Immuno Research ; 111 - 215 - 144 ) diluted ( 1 : 10 ) in immunogold buffer overnight . After washing , the samples were post - fixed with 2 % glutaraldehyde . For platinum replica , the cells were post - fixed by sequential treatment with 0 . 1 % tannic acid and 0 . 2 % uranyl acetate in water , dehydrated through a graded ethanol series ( 10 , 20 , 40 , 60 and 80 % for 5 min each , 100 % twice for 5 min each , 0 . 2 % uranyl acetate in 100 % ethanol for 20 min , and 100 % ethanol four times for 5 min each ) , critical point dried , coated with platinum and carbon and transferred to electron microscopy grids for observation . PREM samples were examined using a JEM - 1400Plus transmission electron microscope ( JEOL USA ) operated at 120 kV . Images were acquired using an AMT BioSprint 16M - ActiveVu CCD camera ( AMT ) and presented in inverted contrast . To simulate super - resolution imaging of Shi from the PREM images , a green point spread function mask with a diameter of 110 nm ( ref . 70 ) was placed on each gold particle using Adobe Illustrator CC . The opacity was set to 40 % for all masks to allow stacking of the green masks where they overlapped . To analyse the frequency of Shi clusters on actin bundles at the fusogenic synapse ( Extended Data Fig . 9c , d ) , the total number of gold particles , number of gold particles in clusters ( each containing ≥ 3 gold particles in a 100 nm 2 square box ) and surface area of the actin bundle examined were measured using ImageJ ( NIH ) software . The density of gold particles was determined as the total number of gold particles divided by the surface area of the actin bundle examined . Actin bundles with similar Shi density were used to analyse the occurrence of Shi clusters , which was determined as the percentage of gold particles in clusters versus the total number of gold particles . Statistics and reproducibility . Statistical significance was assessed using two - tailed Student’s t - test . P values were obtained using Microsoft Excel 2016 . The numbers of biological replicates for each experiment , independent samples for immunofluorescence images and independent experiments for western blots are indicated in the figure captions .

NATuRE CELL BioLoGY | www . nature . com / naturecellbiology Articles Nature Cell Biology Extended Data Fig . 10 | Models describing the mechanisms of dynamin - actin interaction . a , A schematic diagram of the cross section view ( left ) of the dynamin helix with associated actin filaments . During dynamin’s assembly into a helical structure , actin filaments are bundled to the outer rim of the partially assembled dynamin helices via the PRD domains . Once a dynamin helix is fully assembled , the assembly - stimulated GTPase activity of dynamin triggers rapid GTP hydrolysis and helix disassembly , freeing dynamin dimers / tetramers to bundle new actin filaments . A schematic diagram of the side view of the dynamin helix with associated actin filaments ( right ) . At its full capacity , a hDyn1 helix ( illustrated here ) can bundle 16 actin filaments , whereas Shi helix can bundle 12 filaments . b , Dynamin - mediated actin bundling enhances mechanical stiffness of the actin network and promotes membrane protrusions at the fusogenic synapse . Each actin super bundle is likely organized by multiple dynamin helices that are being assembled , the dynamic asynchronous GTP hydrolysis results in a “hybrid” actin bundle that contains stretches of unprotected filaments held together at random locations by partial dynamin helices . Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization on the unprotected areas of the actin bundles generate additional branched actin filaments , which may join the partially occupied bundles via trans - bundle PRD – actin interactions and crosslink multiple bundles . Through dynamin’s cycling between helix assembly and disassembly as a function of GTP hydrolysis , the actin bundles grow thicker and mechanically stiffer . As a consequence , the podosome - like structure at the fusogenic synapse is able to propel membrane protrusions to promote cell - cell fusion .
