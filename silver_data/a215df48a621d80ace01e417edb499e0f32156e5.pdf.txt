Null mutations in ﬁlaggrin ( FLG ) , a key epidermal barrier protein , strongly predispose to AE ; however , the precise role of FLG deﬁciency in AE pathogenesis remains incompletely understood . Objectives : We sought to identify global proteomic changes downstream of FLG deﬁciency in human epidermal living skin – equivalent ( LSE ) models and validate ﬁndings in skin of patients with AE . Methods : Differentially expressed proteins from paired control ( nontargeting control short hairpin RNA [ shNT ] ) and FLG knockdown ( FLG knockdown short hairpin RNA [ shFLG ] ) LSEs were identiﬁed by means of proteomic analysis ( liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry ) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis . Expression of key targets was validated in independent LSE samples ( quantitative RT - PCR and Western blotting ) and in normal and AE skin biopsy specimens ( immunoﬂuorescence ) . Results : Proteomic analysis identiﬁed 17 ( P < _ . 05 ) differentially expressed proteins after FLG knockdown , including kallikrein - 7 ( KLK7 ; 2 . 2 - fold ) , cyclophilin A ( PPIA ; 0 . 9 - fold ) , and coﬁlin - 1 ( CFL1 , 1 . 3 - fold ) . Differential protein expression was conﬁrmed in shNT / shFLG LSEs ; however , only KLK7 was transcriptionally dysregulated .

Furthermore , KLK7 ( 1 . 8 - fold ) andPPIA ( 0 . 65 - fold ) proteinswere differentially expressed in lesionalbiopsy specimensfrom patients with AE relative to normal skin . Conclusions : For the ﬁrst time , we show that loss of FLG in the absence of inﬂammation is sufﬁcient to alter the expression level of proteins relevant to the pathogenesis of AE . These include proteins regulating inﬂammatory , proteolytic , and cytoskeletal functions . We identify PPIA as a novel protein with levels that are decreased in clinically active AE skin and show that the characteristic upregulation of KLK7 expression in patients with AE occurs downstream of FLG loss . Importantly , we highlight disconnect between the epidermal proteome and transcriptome , emphasizing the utility of global proteomic studies . ( J Allergy Clin Immunol 2017 ; 140 : 1299 - 309 . ) Key words : Atopic eczema , dermatitis , skin , proteomic , ﬁlaggrin , kallikrein - 7 , cyclophilin A Filaggrin ( FLG ) is a major constituent of the epidermal barrier , contributing to its structure , function , and hydration . 1 Both sin - gle - and double - allele loss - of - function mutations in FLG strongly predispose to the development of atopic eczema ( AE ) and second - ary atopic conditions , including asthma and allergic rhinitis . 2 - 4 To date , more than 40 different population - speciﬁc FLG mutations have been identiﬁed , each resulting in a truncated proﬁlaggrin gene product , which is not processed into functional FLG mono - mers . 3 Up to 50 % of cases of moderate - to - severe AE in northern Europe can be attributed , at least in part , to an FLG - null muta - tion , 5 , 6 representing the strongest and most consistent genetic risk factors identiﬁed for AE to date ( overall odds ratio , 3 . 12 - 4 . 78 ) . 6 , 7 Furthermore , FLG is polymorphic , with common allelic variants encoding a proﬁlaggrin molecule composed of 10 , 11 , or 12 FLG monomeric repeats . Each additional FLG repeat confers a reduced risk of AE by a factor of 0 . 88 , suggesting that even small increases in FLG expression might be therapeutically beneﬁcial . 8 Both the ﬂaky tail mouse ( which carries a natural mutation virtually ablating all FLG expression 9 ) and FLG knockout mice exhibit enhanced percutaneous antigen transfer and allergen / irritant - induced AE - like inﬂammatory responses . 10 , 11 These models support a primary role for FLG and highlight the impor - tance of a functional cutaneous barrier in AE disease pathogenesis . Recent cohort studies have examined global gene expression changes in patients with AE stratiﬁed by FLG genotype . 12 , 13 Although interesting , their interpretation with regard to the direct role of FLG in AE pathogenesis is confounded by the complex interplay between the epidermal barrier , immune system , and envi - ronment . 14 For example , loss of FLG is also observed in patients with FLG wild - type AE , likely because of its extrinsic downregu - lation by the atopic T H 2 - polarized microenvironment . 15 Moreover , murine models are additionally limited both by secondary muta - tions , notably null mutations in TMEM79 / Matt ( Mattrin ) in the ﬂaky tail mouse , 16 and interspecies differences . The human and murine FLG sequences lack homology , 17 and murine models do not display the heterozygote phenotype typical of most patients with AE . 10 , 11 Consequently , the precise molecular changes occur - ring directly as a result of FLG loss are relatively unknown . A useful alternative tool for the study of epidermal biology is the 3 - dimensional living skin – equivalent ( LSE ) model derived exclusively from primary human keratinocytes . Although by deﬁnition these simpliﬁed models do not recapitulate the complexity of human AE skin , they enable the study of epidermal biology in the absence of confounding inﬂammatory cells . 18 Furthermore , they enable the effect of FLG gene silencing to be analyzed in a pairwise manner on a homogeneous genetic background . Previous LSE studies have largely focused on understanding the ultrastructural and functional consequence of FLG deﬁciency . 19 - 21 In many regards these mirror changes observed in AE skin , sup - porting their utility as a disease model . However , to the best of ourknowledge , nosystematictranscriptomicorproteomicanalysis has been performed after FLG knockdown in human epidermis . The aim of this study was to use FLG knockdown LSE models to investigate the global molecular consequences resulting directly from FLG deﬁciency . A proteomics - based approach was used because protein changes largely represent the functional end point of cell signaling , and recent studies have identiﬁed an important disconnect between the transcriptome and proteome , suggesting that signiﬁcant posttranscriptional regulation occurs . 22 Notably , for the ﬁrst time , we have identiﬁed 17 proteins that are signiﬁcantly differentially expressed after FLG knockdown in LSE cultures . Bioinformatic analysis was used to categorize and align these to putative regulatory networks and showed that loss of FLG alone is sufﬁcient to induce protein changes relevant to the pathogenesis of AE . Speciﬁcally , pathways relating to protease activity , inﬂammation , cell structure , and stress were overrepresented after FLG knockdown . The expression proﬁle of key targets , namely the AE - relevant protease kallikrein - 7 ( KLK7 ) , the novel AE immune modulator cyclophilin A ( PPIA ) , and the actin - binding protein coﬁlin - 1 ( CFL1 ) , were replicated ﬁrst in independent FLG knockdown LSEs and then further characterized in skin biopsy specimens from patients with AE . METHODSPrimarykeratinocyte culture Normal human epidermal keratinocytes extracted from surplus foreskin tissue obtained after informed biobank consent were cultured in low - calcium ( 0 . 06 mmol / L ) EpiLife supplemented with 1 % human keratinocyte growth supplement ( Life Technologies , Paisley , United Kingdom ) , as previously described . 23 All donor subjects had no history of AE .

Patient samples Patients with AE ( as diagnosed per the United Kingdom – modiﬁed Haniﬁn andRajkacriteria 25 ) wererecruitedfromatertiaryreferraldermatologyclinic . Patients older than 18 years not receiving systemic immune - modifying drugs were included in the study after written informed consent and a 2 - week washout period from potent topical steroids .

Statistical analysis was performed with Prism 5 software ( GraphPad Software , La Jolla , Calif ) . Further details are provided in this article’s Online Repository . RESULTSEstablishment of an FLG - deﬁcient human LSE model Reliable and reproducible knockdown of FLG expression in primary keratinocytes was achieved by using a second - generation pGIPZ lentiviral shRNAmir construct targeting the FLG mRNA sequence ( shFLG ) . A nontargeting shRNAmir construct was used as a control ( shNT ) . LSEs were established from transduced keratinocytes , and protein and mRNA knockdown was assessed at day 14 of culture , the time point at which LSEs are fully differen - tiated ( Fig 1 and see Fig E1 in this article’s Online Repository at www . jacionline . org ) . Densitometry of immunoblots conﬁrmed signiﬁcant knockdown in both proﬁlaggrin ( 75 % 6 4 . 1 % , P < _ . 0001 ) and FLG ( 79 % 6 3 . 1 % , P < _ . 0001 ) proteins ( Fig 1 , A , B , and D ) . RT - qPCR conﬁrmed a signiﬁcant reduction in FLG mRNA expression ( 69 % 6 4 . 9 % , P < _ . 0001 ; Fig 1 , E ) . His - tologic examination of LSE sections showed no overt phenotypic changes between nonvirally modiﬁed LSEs and the shNT control LSEs ( data not shown ) or between the shNTand shFLG LSEs ( Fig 1 , C ) . However , quantiﬁcation with ImageJ analysis software iden - tiﬁed a small but signiﬁcant increase in epidermal thickness after FLG knockdown compared with the shNT control . As such , both a thicker viable cell layer ( 1 . 14 6 0 . 03 - fold , P 5 . 0007 ) and stratum corneum ( 1 . 13 6 0 . 06 - fold , P 5 . 05 ) were observed ( see Fig E2 in this article’s Online Repository at www . jacionline . org ) . Seventeen proteins were signiﬁcantly differentially regulated after FLG knockdown in human epidermal skin equivalent The soluble protein fraction from paired shNTand shFLG LSE samples generated from 10 independent biological human donors displaying normal patterns of baseline FLG expression ( see Fig E3 in this article’s Online Repository at www . jacionline . org ) were subject to an open proteomic workﬂow ( Fig 2 , A ) . One thou - sand six hundred forty unique proteins were identiﬁed across all samples , with an average of 634 proteins identiﬁed per LSE . Of these , 367 proteins were identiﬁed in at least 75 % of the shNT and shFLG paired samples ( see Table E1 in this article’s Online Repository at www . jacionline . org ) . The unweighted spectrum counts from this subset of proteins were used in subsequent J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 140 , NUMBER 5 ELIAS ET AL 1301 analysis . Principal component analysis reported clustering by bio - logical donor and not FLG status ( see Fig E4 in this article’s On - line Repository at www . jacionline . org ) . To account for the prominent donor effect , log 10 differences between shNT and shFLG conditions were calculated for each biological donor ( ie , a paired design ) , and log 10 estimated differences in expression proﬁle were used for input for statistical analysis . A summary of the differential expression proﬁle for each biological donor is represented as a heat map ( see Fig E5 in this article’s Online Re - pository at www . jacionline . org ) . Overlaid dendrogram plots de - pict clustering between protein response proﬁles . Notwithstanding the prominent intradonor variability , statisti - cal analysis of the combined data set identiﬁed 17 differentially regulated proteins ( P < _ . 05 ; Fig 3 and see Table E2 in this article’s Online Repository at www . jacionline . org ) . Positive / negative mean differences represent upregulated / downregulated proteins after FLG knockdown , respectively . Differentially expressed proteins broadly relate to a range of functional classes , including proteases ( KLK7 , cathepsin V [ CTSV ] , and carboxypeptidase A4 [ CPA4 ] ) , inﬂammatory mediators ( annexin A3 [ ANXA3 ] , lymphocyte antigen 6D [ LY6D ] , PPIA , and thioredoxin [ TXN ] ) , and cytoskeletal interactors ( FLG , vimentin [ VIM ] , CFL1 , T - complex protein 1 subunit zeta [ CCT6A ] , and tripartite motif - containing protein 29 [ TRIM29 ] ) . The most signiﬁcantly downregulated protein was FLG ( P 5 2 . 0E - 04 ) , internally vali - dating the analysis methodology . FLG - deﬁcient LSEs display expression changes consistent with inﬂammatory dermatoses Ingenuity Pathway Analysis ( IPA ) identiﬁed ‘‘immunological disease’’ ( P 5 2 . 14E - 06 to 3 . 58E - 02 , 9 proteins ) , ‘‘dermatological disease’’ ( P 5 2 . 42E - 05 to 3 . 99E - 02 , 6 proteins ) , and ‘‘inﬂamma - tory disease’’ ( P 5 2 . 42E - 05 to 3 . 66E - 03 , 7 proteins ; Fig 4 , A , and FIG 1 .

Interestingly , within these categories , the most signiﬁcantly associated functional term was ‘‘allergy’’ ( P 5 2 . 15E - 06 , 6 proteins ) . A detailed breakdown of the func - tional terms underlying the top 5 associated disease categories is included in Table E4 in this article’s Online Repository at www . jacionline . org . FLG knockdown in LSEs leads to enrichment in proteins associated with cellular assembly Further IPA analysis identiﬁed that the ‘‘molecular and cellular functions’’ most signiﬁcantly overrepresented in our data set were ‘‘cellular movement’’ ( P 5 3 . 05E - 04 to 4 . 96E - 02 , 7 proteins ) , ‘‘cellular development’’ ( P 5 3 . 94E - 04 to 4 . 47E - 02 , 7 proteins ) , and ‘‘cell growth and proliferation’’ ( P 5 3 . 94E - 04 to 4 . 47E - 02 , 6 proteins ; Fig 4 , B , and see Table E5 in this article’s Online Repos - itory at www . jacionline . org ) . Signiﬁcant functional terms included ‘‘migration of cells’’ ( P 5 3 . 06E - 03 , 7 proteins ) and ‘‘differentiation of cells’’ ( P 5 2 . 94E - 02 , 6 proteins ) . Full details of the functional terms associated with the top 5 cellular function categories are provided in Table E4 . Network analysis returned a single putative network linking all of the differentially regulated proteins with an IPA p - score of 45 ( p - score 5 2 log 10 [ P value ] , see Fig E6 in this article’s Online Repository at www . jacionline . org ) . Consistent with the previous analysis , signiﬁcant functional terms associated with the network included ‘‘hyperplasia of epithelial cells’’ ( P 5 1 . 02E - 06 , 7 pro - teins ) and ‘‘formation of skin’’ ( P 5 3 . 69E - 06 , 12 proteins ) . Pro - teins implicated in dermatological and / or inﬂammatory disease have been highlighted in pink ( see Fig E6 ) . Proteins involved in cell stress signaling pathways are overrepresented in LSEs after FLG knockdown The canonical pathways most signiﬁcantly associated with the differentially expressed proteins included ‘‘EIF2 signaling’’ ( P 5 1 . 51E - 05 , 4 proteins ) , ‘‘regulation of eukaryotic initiation factor ( eIF ) 4 and p70S6K signaling’’ ( P 5 1 . 40E - 03 , 2 proteins ) , and ‘‘mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) signaling’’ ( P 5 1 . 08E - 02 , 2 proteins ; Fig 4 , C , and see Table E6 in this ar - ticle’s Online Repository at www . jacionline . org ) . The top 5 signiﬁcantly associated canonical pathways are also overlaid onto the putative molecular network ( see Fig E6 ) . Conﬁrmation of proteomics results in independent LSEs A number of differentially expressed proteins were selected for independent validation at the protein and mRNA level in inde - pendent shNT and shFLG LSEs derived from biological donors distinct from those used in the original study to conﬁrm the ﬁndings from the proteomic analysis . The expression proﬁles of key representatives from a distinct protein class , such as proteases ( KLK7 ) , immunomodulatory functions ( PPIA ) , and cytoskeletal interacting proteins ( CFL1 ) , were selected based on their low P value , high donor ratio , and relevance to skin morphology / disease . In line with the proteomic results , all 3 proteins were signiﬁcantly differentially expressed , as assessed by means of immunoblotting and densitometric analysis in the independent LSEs ( Fig 5 , A and B ) . Furthermore , both the relative magnitude and direction of response were preserved : CFL1 , 2 . 1 6 0 . 27 - fold ( P 5 . 03 ) , KLK7 , 1 . 89 6 0 . 29 - fold ( P 5 . 007 ) , and PPIA , 0 . 52 6 0 . 11 - fold ( P 5 . 05 ; Fig 5 , A and B ) . FIG 2 . Overview of the open proteomic workﬂow . Peptides were extracted from shNT and shFLG LSEs and separated by means of liquid chromatography mass spectrometry ( LC - MS and LC - MS / MS ) . Proteins were identiﬁed from MS / MS spectra , and unweighted spectrum counts were used to determine relative expres - sion levels . Selected targets were independently validated . J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 140 , NUMBER 5 ELIAS ET AL 1303 In contrast to the protein data , there was no signiﬁcant difference in CFL1 and PPIA mRNA expression levels between shNT and shFLG LSEs , as assessed by using probe - based RT - qPCR assays , underscoring the relevance of a proteomics - based approach . However , KLK7 mRNA expression was increased in the shFLG condition , which is consistent with the protein data ( 1 . 2 6 0 . 06 - fold , P 5 . 05 ; Fig 5 , C ) . Replication of FLG knockdown LSE ﬁndings in AE skin Protein expression analysis was performed on human skin from healthy control subjects and patients with AE to determine whether these in vitro ﬁndings were relevant to the in vivo AE dis - ease setting . AE samples were collected from sites of both clini - cally active eczema ( involved skin ) and macroscopically normal skin ( uninvolved ) . Protein expression of FLG , PPIA , KLK7 , and CFL1 was assessed by using a combination of immunoﬂuorescence imaging ( Fig 6 , A ) and quantiﬁcation by means of image analysis ( Fig 6 , B - E ) . FLG mutational status of all control subjects and patients with AE was determined by using next - generation sequencing . All control subjects reported were FLG wild - type , and 31 % of sub - jects with AE carried FLG mutations ( Fig 6 , B - E , and see Table E7 in this article’s Online Repository at www . jacionline . org ) . Overall FLG expression was reduced in both uninvolved and involved AE skin compared with that in healthy control subjects , although signiﬁcance was only observed at sites of clinically active disease ( 0 . 6 6 0 . 1 - fold , P < _ . 05 ; Fig 6 , A and B ) . FLG expression was particularly reduced in FLG - heterozygous sub - jects and almost absent in the FLG double - allele mutant subject ( Fig 6 , A and B ) , and accordingly , a signiﬁcant correlation be - tween FLG genotype ( number of expressed alleles ) and expres - sion was observed ( r 5 0 . 48 , P 5 . 007 ) across the whole data set . The protein abundance of PPIA was signiﬁcantly reduced in involved AE skin compared with control skin ( 0 . 65 6 0 . 06 - fold , P < _ . 02 ) , whereas KLK7 expression was signiﬁcantly increased in both uninvolved ( 1 . 8 6 0 . 02 - fold , P < _ . 02 ) and involved ( 1 . 84 6 0 . 02 - fold , P < _ . 009 ) AE skin . There was a trend toward correlation between FLG and PPIA expression ( r 5 0 . 31 , P 5 . 09 ) and a signiﬁcant inverse correlation between FLG and KLK7 expression ( r 5 2 0 . 38 , P 5 . 04 ) . However , in neither instance did protein expression stratify or correlate according to FLG mutational status ( PPIA : r 5 0 . 08 , P 5 . 68 ; KLK7 : r 5 2 0 . 18 , P 5 . 34 ; Fig 6 , A - D ) . In contrast , the abundance of CFL1 was unchanged between normal and AE skin and did not display any correlation with respective FLG expression ( r 5 2 0 . 12 , P 5 . 51 ; Fig 6 , A ) . DISCUSSION In this study we used an in vitro human LSE model to investi - gate the proteomic changes arising from FLG deﬁciency per se in the absence of any confounding systemic inﬂammation . 19 FIG 3 .

J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2017 1304 ELIAS ET AL A global proteomics approach and IPA strikingly revealed that shFLG LSEs displayed a disease proﬁle consistent with inﬂam - matory dermatologic disease and an enrichment in proteins asso - ciated with cellular assembly . Signiﬁcant functional terms included ‘‘allergy’’ ( increased : ANXA3 , CFL1 , CTSV , and KLK7 ; decreased : FLG and PPIA ) and ‘‘differentiation of cells’’ ( increased : CFL1 , CTSV , and RPL22 ; decreased : FLG , PPIA , and VIM ) , suggesting that our FLG knockdown model displays many molecular characteristics typical of AE ( Fig 4 and see Tables E3 - E6 ) . Similar functional annotations , speciﬁcally inﬂammatory and extracellular matrix dysregulation , have also been described in AE transcriptomic data sets , 12 , 13 , 27 including those from FLG - null and haplosufﬁcient patients with AE , 12 , 13 reinforcing the util - ity of our disease model and underscoring the central role of FLG deﬁciency in AE pathophysiology . Carefully controlled protease activity is essential for the maintenance of epidermal homeostasis and barrier function . 28 In addition to increased expression of the chymotrypsin - like serine protease KLK7 , expression of the cysteine protease CTSVand zinc - dependent protease CPA4 was signiﬁcantly upre - gulated after FLG knockdown in the LSE model . KLK7 is highly expressed in skin , 29 and its dysregulation has been implicated to AE pathogenesis ; protein expression is increased in both involved and uninvolved AE skin and in the epidermis of ﬂaky tail mice . 29 - 31 Furthermore , overexpression of human KLK7 in mu - rine models causes severe pruritus , increased epidermal thick - ness , and dermal inﬂammation . 30 Our ﬁndings in AE skin are consistent with these results , demonstrating both increased over - all epidermal KLK7 expression and ectopic expression within the lower epidermal compartments compared with those seen in healthy control skin . Importantly our novel in vitro data demon - strating increased KLK7 mRNA and protein expression after FLG knockdown identiﬁes for the ﬁrst time that KLK7 is tran - scriptionally regulated , either directly or indirectly downstream FIG 4 .

J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 140 , NUMBER 5 ELIAS ET AL 1305 of FLG ( Figs 3 and 5 ) . The combination of increased KLK7 expression and an atopic epidermal environment known to be permissive for protease activation 32 has signiﬁcant implications for barrier homeostasis . In addition to the perturbations in epidermal structure , enhanced KLK activity also drives inﬂam - mation both directly through IL - 1 activation 33 and indirectly through overexpression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin , a potent inducer and propagator of T H 2 - polarixed inﬂammation downstream of protease activated receptor 2 signaling . 34 The mRNA expression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin is increased in lesional AE skin , 34 ﬂaky tail mice , 31 and our LSEs after FLG knockdown ( data not shown ) . This , combined with our observa - tion that proteins of known immunomodulatory function ( PPIA , TXN , ANXA3 , and LY6D ) are signiﬁcantly perturbed by FLG knockdown , supports the idea that FLG deﬁciency can contribute to AE inﬂammation independently of immune cells . PPIA is an ubiquitously expressed immunophilin family member protein with roles in protein folding , trafﬁcking , and immune modulation . 35 For the ﬁrst time , we show that PPIA is downregulated in the context of FLG deﬁciency and in AE skin ( Figs 3 , 5 , and 6 ) , suggesting that PPIA might represent a novel disease mechanism downstream of FLG . Interestingly , PPIA is the cytoplasmic binding partner of cyclosporine , an effective ther - apeutic in patients with AE . 36 Cyclosporine regulates gene tran - scription , growth , and differentiation of human keratinocytes , 37 as well as their production of inﬂammatory cytokines . 38 PPIA knockout mice experience spontaneous T H 2 - polarized allergic disease and an immune proﬁle akin to AE , although no dermatitis is reported . 39 No concurrent reduction in PPIA mRNA expression was observed in shFLG LSEs ( Fig 5 , C ) ; the reduction in intracel - lular protein expression might instead reﬂect an increase in PPIA secretion known to be triggered after inﬂammatory / stress stimuli in epithelia . 35 Extracellular PPIA functions as both a proinﬂam - matory stimuli ( autocrine / paracrine ) and potent chemoattractant of CD147 1 immune cells . 35 , 40 Stress and inﬂammatory pathways were overrepresented in our data set after FLG knockdown ( Fig 4 ) , and keratinocytes are known to secrete the close family mem - ber cyclophilin B and to express CD147 cell - surface receptors , 41 suggesting that similar regulation of PPIA might occur within the epidermis . Furthermore , extracellular PPIA and TXN ( increased in shFLG LSEs ) have been identiﬁed as IgE - reactive self - antigens in patients with AE , 42 , 43 and therefore their dysregulation might represent an additional pathogenic mechanism downstream of FLG . Finally , cyclophilin members are regulated during epithelial terminal differentiation , 44 suggesting that PPIA dysregulation downstream of FLG might also have implications for epidermal barrier structure and function . Keratinocyte differentiation is associated with extensive keratin and actin remodeling . 45 We also identiﬁed signiﬁcantly differentially expressed proteins FIG 5 . Validation of proteomics ﬁndings .

J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL NOVEMBER 2017 1306 ELIAS ET AL with known roles in cytoskeletal / actin remodeling ( CFL1 , CCT6A , and VIM ) as novel targets of FLG loss . CFL1 is an essen - tial actin - binding protein that regulates cell motility , growth , divi - sion , and differentiation by controlling actin ﬁlament assembly and disassembly . 46 Overexpression of active ( unphosphorylated ) CFL1 in LSE models reduces corneocyte compaction , whereas partial knockdown increased proliferation , supporting a role for CFL1 in keratinocyte homeostasis . 47 In our LSE model CFL1 protein but not mRNA expression was signiﬁcantly increased af - ter FLG knockdown ( Fig 5 ) . Pathways associated with regulation of the actin cytoskeleton have been reported to be transcription - ally overrepresented in AE skin , 13 and CFL1 mRNA expression is signiﬁcantly upregulated in the involved skin of patients with AE , psoriasis , and lichen planus , 48 suggesting that dysregulation FIG 6 .

J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 140 , NUMBER 5 ELIAS ET AL 1307 of the actin cytoskeleton might be a contributing pathogenic mechanism . Interestingly , unlike PPIA and KLK7 , the protein expression pattern of CFL1 in AE skin did not align to the shFLG LSE model , and we observed no increase in CFL1 protein expres - sion in the patients with AE ( Fig E6 ) . The regulation of CFL1 is complex , involving phosphorylation , inhibitor complexes , and cooperation with other actin - binding proteins 46 ; understanding its role in patients with AE will require further investigation . Further IPA analysis signiﬁcantly associated dysregulation of eIF2 ( RPL22 , RPL4 , RPS27 , and RPS5 ) , eIF4 ( RPS27 and RPS5 ) , and mTOR ( RPS27 and RPS5 ) signaling with FLG knockdown . Collectively , these pathways cooperate to regulate transcriptional and translational initiation in response to a wide variety of environmental stress stimuli , including infection . 49 , 50 Patients with AE have an increased susceptibility to both dissem - inated viral ( eczema herpeticum ) and bacterial skin infections , 51 and the risk of both is increased in FLG - deﬁcient subjects . 52 Consistent with this , stress responses , namely type 1 interferon – mediated anti - pathogenic deference , are overrepresented in the transcriptome of FLG - null and haplosufﬁcient patients with AE , 12 and furthermore , type 1 interferon expression is increased in patients with eczema herpeticum . 53 Type 1 interferons are secreted after viral 54 or bacterial 55 infection and mediate both immunomodulatory responses and local cell - cycle regulation in part through activation of eIF2 , 56 mTOR , and downstream p70 - S6K / eIF4 signaling . 57 For the ﬁrst time , our in vitro data suggest that the exaggerated but ineffective upregulation of type 1 inter - feron – mediated defense observed in patients with AE 12 might reﬂect an inherent defect downstream of FLG rather than / in addi - tion to a deregulated response to pathogen exposure . 12 , 53 There - fore dysregulation of these pathways as a result of inherited or acquired FLG deﬁciency might contribute to the propensity of pa - tients with AE to have bacterial and viral skin infections . Overall , our data reinforce that loss of FLG is itself an important pathogenic factor in patients with AE , driving the development and exacerbation of barrier and immune dysfunc - tion . Importantly , we have shown that loss of FLG alone in the absence of any systemic immune signals can disrupt epidermal homeostasis resulting in proteomic changes relevant to AE . Our data are consistent with the so - called ‘‘outside - to - inside’’ disease hypothesis and places FLG deﬁciency ﬁrmly upstream of prote - ase , innate inﬂammatory , and cytoskeletal pathway dysregula - tion . The observed protein changes in AE skin occurred to a similar degree in FLG - depleted , FLG wild - type , and single - and double - allele mutated subjects , suggesting that the mechanism of FLG reduction ( whether through genotype , cytokine effects , or a combination thereof ) might not be important . For the ﬁrst time , we have identiﬁed 17 proteins that are signiﬁcantly differentially expressed in the absence of FLG , including KLK7 , PPIA , and CFL1 . Conﬁrmation of these results in independent LSE cultures validates the proteomics methodol - ogies , interpretation and the biological reproducibility of our identiﬁed targets . Replication of PPIA and KLK7 expression proﬁles in skin biopsy specimens from patients with AE further underscores the utility of our disease model . To the best of our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst study to implicate loss of PPIA resulting from FLG deﬁciency to AE pathogenesis and also to show that the known increase in KLK7 expression observed in AE skin can occur as a consequence of FLG loss . Finally , our pathway analysis suggests a possible role of FLG deﬁciency in regulating cell stress , including mTOR , eIF4 , and eIF2 signaling , which is broadly consistent with RNA sequencing analysis of uninvolved FLG - deﬁcient AE skin . 12 Lack of correlation between the protein and mRNA expression proﬁles of CFL1 and PPIA emphasize the value of proteomic studies . Complementary transcriptomic studies will provide further understanding of the signaling mech - anisms upstream of our observations .
