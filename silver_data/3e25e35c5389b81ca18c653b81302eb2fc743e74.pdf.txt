The aim of this study was to explore the relationship among socioeconomic status , family resilience , and social support , and psychological resilience among Chinese maintenance hemodialysis patients . Methods : This cross - sectional study was conducted in the hemodialysis centers of three comprehensive hospitals in China from September to December 2020 using convenience sampling . Two hundred ﬁfty - eight patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis were investigated using a sociodemographic questionnaire , the Chinese version of the Medical Outcomes Study - Social Support Survey ( MOS - SSS ) , Chinese Family Resilience Assessment Scale ( C - FRAS ) , and Chinese version of the Conner and Davidson resilience scale ( CD - RISC ) . Results : Maintenance hemodialysis patients reported a low level of physical resilience , with a score of ( 58 . 92 ± 15 . 27 ) . Hierarchical linear regression analysis showed that education level ( β = 0 . 127 , p = 0 . 018 ) , maintenance of a positive outlook by the family ( β = 0 . 269 , p = 0 . 001 ) , positive social interaction support from the family ( β = 0 . 233 , p = 0 . 002 ) , and tangible support ( β = − 0 . 135 , p = 0 . 037 ) were signiﬁcantly associated with psychological resilience . Conclusion : SES , family resilience and social support may be potential predictive factors of psychological resilience . Interventions to improve the family resilience and social support may be beneﬁcial to promote the psychological resilience of Chinese maintenance hemodialysis patients .

Predictive Factors for Psychological Resilience INTRODUCTION Hemodialysis is the main form of renal replacement therapy in the terminal stage of chronic renal failure ( 1 ) . According to the latest census data released in the China Kidney Disease Network Data Report ( 2 ) , the prevalence of maintenance hemodialysis among patients with chronic renal failure in China is 402 . 18 per million . Hemodialysis treatment preserves the lives of patients with terminal stage renal failure but does not prevent the emotional suﬀering associated with chronic stress related to the disease burden , dialysis treatment , functional limitation , and fear of death ( 3 – 7 ) . The incidence of emotional distress is higher in patients who received maintenance hemodialysis than in those with chronic kidney disease alone ( 8 ) . It has been proposed that an individual’s internal resources and external support play important roles in overcoming emotional distress during the treatment ( 9 , 10 ) . Psychological resilience , deﬁned as an individual’s ability to actively mobilize all favorable factors to maintain or restore relatively stable mental and physical functions in the face of stressful life events and adversity ( 11 ) , is widely recognized as an individual’s competency and strength to successfully cope with stress ( 12 ) . Higher psychological resilience is associated with greater acceptance of the disease , higher compliance with therapeutic regimens , and more favorable outcomes in patients with chronic renal diseases ( 13 , 14 ) . Lower psychological resilience is associated with emotional dysregulation ( 15 ) and variations in sensory processing ( 16 , 17 ) , which can increase the risk of suicidality in some patient populations ( 18 ) . As cognitive ﬂexibility is reported to be a critical factor to prevent negative outcomes and suicidal behavior in response to stressful life events ( 19 ) , it is important to explore the psychological resilience of maintenance hemodialysis patients . The systematic self - reﬂection model of resilience highlights the resilience resource of an individual , such as socioeconomic status ( SES ) , family resources , and social support , which is one of the fundamental capacities for psychological resilience . The role of SES in the development of psychological resilience is contradictive . Wister et al . ( 20 ) suggests that individuals with higher SES have greater resilience , as they have greater social and economic resources available to them compared to individuals of lower SES . Other theorists ( 21 ) hypothesized that individual with low SES will exhibit prolonged , high - eﬀort coping behavior to deal with emotional stress . To our best knowledge , there is no empirical study exploring the relationship of SES and psychological resilience among maintenance hemodialysis patients . Social support , a multidimensional concept , is deﬁned as the provision of psychological and material resources by caregivers , medical staﬀ , and other social networks to beneﬁt an individual’s ability to cope with stress ( 22 ) . The subjective perception of social support has been identiﬁed as a protective factor for psychological resilience in other populations , such as adolescents ( 23 , 24 ) , cancer patients ( 25 , 26 ) , and older individuals ( 27 ) . However , the role of objective social support on psychological resilience is less clear . Objective social support can come in varying forms , including tangible support , informational / emotional support , positive social interaction support , and aﬀectionate support ( 28 ) . To better understand the mechanisms underlying the eﬀects of social support , it is vital to understand the types of social support that are beneﬁcial for psychological resilience . Family resilience , one of the most important family resources , is deﬁned as a family’s ability to withstand and rebound from adversity and to become stronger and more resourceful ( 29 ) . Previous studies have identiﬁed multiple dimensions of family resilience , such as family cohesion , family communication , a family’s ability to make meaning of adversity , maintaining a positive outlook , utilizing social and economic resources , etc . ( 30 ) . However , there are few studies exploring the eﬀect of each aspect of family resilience on individual resilience . Only one recent study of Japanese hemodialysis patients found family communication was associated with higher psychological resilience , while family cohesion was not associated with individual resilience ( 31 ) . Some scholars caution that the protective or risk characteristic of psychological resilience depends on the context and meaning of each element , particularly how each factor is perceived by an individual ( 32 ) . Therefore , the purpose of this study is to examine the predictive roles of SES , family resilience , and social support for psychological resilience among Chinese Maintenance hemodialysis patients . We hypothesized that socioeconomic status , family resilience , and social support will be positively associated with psychological resilience after controlling for demographic and clinical variables . METHODS Participants Two hundred eighty patients were recruited using the convenience sampling method in this study . The inclusion criteria were as follows : ( 1 ) age 18 years or above ; ( 2 ) receiving hemodialysis regularly for more than 3 months ; ( 3 ) no communication barriers ; ( 4 ) willing to participate in this study . The exclusion criteria were : ( 1 ) physician - diagnosed psychiatric or mental disorders based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ( DSM - IV , TR ) ( 33 ) , such as schizophrenia , bipolar disorder , and depression ; ( 2 ) neurological disorders or cognitive impairments ( e . g . delirium , dementia ) ; and ( 3 ) inability to communicate verbally or complete the questionnaires . The investigator carefully collected the participants’ psychiatric histories by reviewing their medical records and questioning the patients or their family members . Of the 280 eligible maintenance hemodialysis patients invited to participate , 22 eligible participants declined to participate due to a lack of interest or fatigue . The remaining 258 participants all returned complete and valid questionnaires , resulting in a valid sample size of 258 ( participation rate = 92 . 14 % ) . Procedure After obtaining ethical approval for the study from the Aﬃliated Hospital of the Medical University Ethics Committee ( No . 2020198 ) , this cross - sectional study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki in the hemodialysis center Frontiers in Psychiatry | www . frontiersin . org 2 September 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 723344 Qiu et al . Predictive Factors for Psychological Resilience of three comprehensive hospitals in Zhejiang Province , China , from September to December 2020 . Data were collected using structured questionnaires with the cooperation of hemodialysis center nurses . A trained investigator identiﬁed potential eligible patients by reviewing their medical records and asking about their psychiatric history for initial screening . The eligible participants were informed of the purpose and procedure of the study . Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before starting any procedures , and the conﬁdentiality of their information was guaranteed . The participants were instructed to complete the pen - and - paper self - reported questionnaires in a quiet room before the hemodialysis treatment . For participants who could not write , the investigator read out the questionnaire items verbatim without adding further explanation and completed the questionnaires according to the patient’s responses . The entire survey process lasted for 20 – 30 min , and the investigator immediately reviewed the questionnaires and asked the patients to provide any missing items after each survey was completed . All participants were provided with a small gift of a cookie valued at $ 1 as compensation . Measures Demographic and Clinical Variables The following variables were assessed : age , gender , employment status , marital status , medical insurance ( yes / no ) , disease duration , dialysis duration , and frequency of hemodialysis and comorbidities . SES Two indicators for SES were assessed . Financial status was measured as the monthly household income per capita and was coded into four categories , from 1 ( < 2 , 000 RMB ) to 4 ( > 6 , 000 RMB ) . Education was measured as the highest grade of schooling completed and was coded into four categories , from 1 ( primary school ) to 4 ( college or higher ) . Social Support The Chinese version of the Medical Outcomes Study – Social Support Survey ( MOS - SSS ) ( 34 ) , a 19 - item scale , was used to assess the extent to which each individual had the support of others to cope with their stressful situation during the course of chronic disease . MOS - SSS recognizes the following four types of social support : informational / emotional support ( eight items , expression of positive eﬀect and empathetic understanding / oﬀering of advice , information , guidance or feedback ) , tangible support ( four items , provision of material aid or behavioral assistance ) , positive social interactive support ( four items , the availability of other persons to entertain the patient ) , and aﬀectionate support ( three items , expressions of love and aﬀection ) . Participants are asked to indicate how often each type of social support is available to them when they need it . A 5 - point response ranging from 1 = none of the time to 5 = all of the time is used . The total score ranges from 19 to 95 , with higher scores indicating higher levels of social support . The Cronbach’s α coeﬃcient was 0 . 944 for the total score in the present study . Family Resilience Family resilience was measured using the 44 - item Chinese version of the Family Resilience Assessment Scale ( C - FRAS ) ( 30 ) , which comprises four subscales : family communication and problem solving ( 27 items ) , utilizing social and economic resources ( eight items ) , maintaining a positive outlook ( six items ) , and ability to make meaning of adversity ( three items ) . Each item is rated on a four - point Likert scale from 1 = strongly disagree to 4 = strongly agree , with total scores ranging from 44 to 176 . Higher scores indicate higher levels of family resilience . The Cronbach’s α coeﬃcient was 0 . 968 for the total score in the present study . Psychological Resilience Psychological resilience was assessed using the Chinese version of the Conner and Davidson resilience scale ( CD - RISC ) ( 35 ) . The 25 - item CD - RISC contains three subscales , namely tenacity ( 13 items ) , strength ( eight items ) , and optimism ( four items ) . It uses a Likert ﬁve - point scale from 0 = not true at all to 4 = true all the time , with a total score of 0 – 100 . Higher scores indicate higher levels of psychological resilience . The Cronbach’s α coeﬃcient of the scale in the present study was 0 . 927 . Statistical Analysis All statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS 25 . 0 ( IBM Corp . , Armonk , NY , USA ) . The t - test or one - way ANOVA was used to compare the groups . Pearson’s r correlations were calculated to test for unadjusted associations between SES , social support , family resilience , and psychological resilience . As the total scores of psychological resilience approached normality ( W = 0 . 995 , p = 0 . 479 ) , hierarchical linear regression analyses were conducted with the sociodemographic and clinical variables in Step 1 . SES was added in Step 2 , family resilience was included in Step 3 , and social support was entered in Step 4 . Statistical signiﬁcance was set at the level of 0 . 05 or less ( two - tailed ) . Statistical signiﬁcance was interpreted as a p < 0 . 05 ( two - tailed ) . RESULTS Descriptive Statistics Two hundred ﬁfty - eight maintenance hemodialysis patients ( 174 men and 84 women ) , with a mean age of 57 . 6 ± 13 . 83 years , submitted complete questionnaires . Participants were predominantly unemployed ( n = 213 , 82 . 6 % ) , married / cohabitating ( n = 228 , 88 . 4 % ) , with medical insurance ( n = 253 , 98 . 1 % ) , and diagnosed with chronic renal failure for no < 10 years ( n = 137 , 53 . 1 % ) . Regarding the duration of hemodialysis , 48 ( 18 . 6 % ) participants had been treated for < 1 year , 109 ( 42 . 2 % ) for 1 – 5 years ( not including 5 years ) , 65 ( 25 . 2 % ) for 5 – 10 years ( not including 10 years ) , and 36 ( 14 % ) for no < 10 years . The mean duration of maintenance hemodialysis treatment was 58 . 38 months ( SD = 48 . 33 , range 4 – 236 ) . Regarding the SES , the sample comprised participants with education levels of primary school or below ( n = 70 , 27 . 1 % ) , middle school ( n = 97 , 37 . 6 % ) , high school ( n = 59 , 22 . 9 % ) , and college or higher ( n = 32 , 12 . 4 % ) . For ﬁnancial status , 38 ( 14 . 7 % ) Frontiers in Psychiatry | www . frontiersin . org 3 September 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 723344 Qiu et al . Predictive Factors for Psychological Resilience participants reported a family monthly income of < 2 , 000 RMB , 93 ( 36 . 0 % ) reported a family monthly income of 2 , 000 – 4 , 000 RMB , 76 ( 29 . 5 % ) reported a family monthly income of 4 , 001 – 6 , 000 RMB , and 51 ( 19 . 8 % ) reported a family monthly income of > 6 , 000 RMB . The characteristics of the study population are summarized in Table 1 . Association Between Demographic and Clinical Variables , SES , and Psychological Resilience A signiﬁcant diﬀerence in psychological resilience was found according to diﬀerent demographic variables including age ( t = 2 . 027 , p = 0 . 044 ) , occupational status ( t = 3 . 890 , p < 0 . 001 ) , and marital status ( t = − 2 . 122 , p = 0 . 035 ) . A signiﬁcant diﬀerence was also observed in the psychological resilience of patients with diﬀerent educational levels ( F = 11 . 379 , p < 0 . 001 ) and diﬀerent monthly household incomes per capita ( F = 9 . 667 , p < 0 . 001 ; see Table 1 ) . Correlation Between Social Support , Family Resilience , and Psychological Resilience The results of the correlation analysis are shown in Table 2 . Signiﬁcant correlations were observed between all four domains of social support and psychological resilience ( r = 0 . 207 – 0 . 543 , p < 0 . 01 ) . The family resilience subscales also positively correlated with psychological resilience ( r = 0 . 390 – 0 . 575 , p < 0 . 01 ) . Hierarchical Linear Regression Analysis Hierarchical linear regression analysis was conducted to identify the relative contribution of the independent variables to psychological resilience ( see Table 3 ) . Variables correlated with psychological resilience in the univariate analyses were entered into the model . When the demographic characteristics were controlled in Step 1 , SES , which was tested in Step 2 , explained an additional 12 . 8 % of variance in psychological resilience . Participants with higher levels of education ( β = 0 . 286 , p < 0 . 001 ) and monthly household income per capita ( β = 0 . 151 , p = 0 . 014 ) reported greater levels of psychological resilience . Family resilience , which was included in Step 3 , explained 23 . 3 % of the variance in psychological resilience . Higher scores in the maintenance of a positive outlook ( β = 0 . 325 , p < 0 . 001 ) were indicative of greater levels of psychological resilience . After controlling for the demographics , SES , and family resilience , tangible support ( β = − 0 . 135 , p = 0 . 037 ) and positive social interaction support ( β = 0 . 233 , p = 0 . 002 ) emerged as signiﬁcant predictors of psychological resilience . The addition of social support in Step 4 accounted for 5 . 5 % incremental criterion variance . Furthermore , as shown in Table 3 , monthly household income per capita no longer showed predictive utility in the last step ( β = 0 . 096 , p = 0 . 058 ) . DISCUSSION In the present study , maintenance hemodialysis patients reported a low level of psychological resilience ( 58 . 92 ± 15 . 27 ) , which was signiﬁcantly lower than the normal level in the general population in China ( 65 . 46 ± 13 . 93 ) ( 36 ) , but was similar to the level of Chinese cancer patients ( 57 . 12 ± 13 . 56 ) ( 37 ) . The treatment process and severe lifestyle changes related to maintenance hemodialysis may reduce the ability of patients to adapt and cope with adversity ( 38 ) . Since the low psychological resilience of hemodialysis patients is associated with their lower health - promoting behavior and higher level of depression ( 8 ) , it is highly important for clinical staﬀ to help these patients increase their psychological resilience . As hypothesized , the results of this study indicated that better SES ( higher education level and family income ) contributed to a higher level of psychological resilience in maintenance hemodialysis patients , which supports the theory proposed by Wister et al . ( 20 ) . Maintenance hemodialysis patients with better SES might have more comprehensive understanding of the disease , adopt more eﬀective problem - solving strategies , and have access to more information / health care services ( 39 , 40 ) . Interestingly , the predictive utility of family monthly income was no longer signiﬁcant when social support was included in the model , which indicates that the family ﬁnancial level of maintenance hemodialysis patients may aﬀect the psychological resilience through the role of social support . Therefore , it will be more important in future studies to develop more appropriate social support systems for maintenance hemodialysis patients with low SES . Our results support the hypothesis that family resilience is positively correlated with psychological resilience , indicating that having a family that ﬂexibly responds to changes in a highly challenging environment may lead to positive changes in mental health among hemodialysis patients ( 41 ) . Maintaining a positive outlook was an independent family resilience factor that inﬂuenced psychological resilience in this study , which suggests that maintaining a positive outlook is the most fundamental element of family resilience to foster an individual’s psychological resilience ( 42 ) . Our ﬁndings provide some new evidence that a family’s shared belief in maintaining a positive outlook is essential to mobilize relational resources to support the positive adaptation of the family and , thus , to guide family members to embrace hope and ﬂexibly respond to hardship when faced with stressful events . Therefore , it is important for families to preserve and nourish their shared beliefs and positive outlook as a way to promote psychological resilience during the process of disease and hemodialysis treatment . Our ﬁndings also support the hypothesis of a positive correlation between social support and psychological resilience . Social interaction support showed a positively predictive eﬀect on psychological resilience , possibly due to the fact that individuals who reported greater support received in positive social interactions would have higher levels of self - eﬃcacy ( 43 ) and more resources to cope with stress and the burden of illness ( 44 ) . Qualitative studies found that positive social interactions gives hemodialysis patients a sense of meaning in life and hope for the future ( 45 ) , as well as positive emotional experiences and self - worth ( 46 ) . Thus , nursing interventions focused on promoting positive social interaction Frontiers in Psychiatry | www . frontiersin . org 4 September 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 723344 Qiu et al .

In contrast to our hypothesis , tangible support was negatively predictive of psychological resilience after controlling for other kinds of social support in this study . High tangible support with activities for daily living may threaten self - esteem and the sense of competence and mastery ( 47 ) . Patients who perceived high tangible support without aﬀectionate supportive communication may view such favors as expressions of obligation rather than a manifestation of love , thereby reducing psychological resilience ( 48 ) . Therefore , it is important for nurses and caregivers to strike a balance between providing help and maintaining the patient’s sense of self - esteem and self - worth , despite the patient’s reliance on others for care and support ( 49 ) .

Implications for Practice From a clinical perspective , this study highlights the practical importance of assessing the SES , family resilience , and social support to screen patients with a risk of low psychological resilience , and provides evidence for tailoring family resilience and social support - oriented intervention to improve the psychological resilience of maintenance hemodialysis patients . Speciﬁcally , clinical practitioners can conduct family interventions that focus on promoting the shared family belief of a positive outlook toward the disease and treatment to foster individual resilience . Clinical practitioners should also evaluate the sources of social support during treatment and provide appropriate help to guide maintenance hemodialysis patients to seek eﬀective support and enhance their resilience .

Predictive Factors for Psychological Resilience Limitations There are several limitations of the present study . First , causal relationships cannot be inferred due to the cross - sectional design of this study . Therefore , longitudinal study designs should be used to further explore the complicated dynamic eﬀect of SES , family resilience , and social support on psychological resilience . Secondly , the subjective nature of self - reported questionnaires can lead to reporting bias , especially since psychiatric pathologies and psychological disorders in the participants were not evaluated through speciﬁc and structured interviews . However , we initially reviewed the medical records and inquired about the psychiatric history of the patients . Thirdly , family SES was measured only based on the family income and education level in this study . Multiple indices of family SES should be used in future studies . Fourthly , although we adjusted for demographic factors in the analysis , there may be residual confounding factors present , such as the mood of the day and comorbidities . Finally , the generalizability of the results of this study may be limited by convenience sampling . It is necessary to conduct multi - center investigations in future studies . CONCLUSION Our study showed a low level of psychological resilience among Chinese maintenance hemodialysis patients . The present study demonstrated that SES , represented by education level and family income , is an important predictor of psychological resilience . Maintaining a positive outlook as the most important aspect of family resilience and positive social interactive support positively predicted the patient’s level of psychological resilience , while tangible support served as a negative predictor of psychological resilience . Therefore , an approach that focuses on psychological resilience , which patients with lower SES can apply to deal with stress , may reduce the health disparity . In addition , family interventions tailored to maintaining the family’s positive outlook or interventions that promote appropriate social support are needed to improve the psychological resilience of maintenance hemodialysis patients .
