Goode 1 The mechanisms by which cells destabilize and rapidly disassemble ﬁlamentous actin networks have remained elusive ; however , Coronin , Coﬁlin and AIP1 have been implicated in this process . Here using multi - wavelength single - molecule ﬂuorescence imaging , we show that mammalian Cor1B , Cof1 and AIP1 work in concert through a temporally ordered pathway to induce highly efﬁcient severing and disassembly of actin ﬁlaments . Cor1B binds to ﬁlaments ﬁrst , and dramatically accelerates the subsequent binding of Cof1 , leading to heavily decorated , stabilized ﬁlaments . Cof1 in turn recruits AIP1 , which rapidly triggers severing and remains bound to the newly generated barbed ends . New growth at barbed ends generated by severing was blocked speciﬁcally in the presence of all three proteins . This activity enabled us to reconstitute and directly visualize single actin ﬁlaments being rapidly polymerized by formins at their barbed ends while simultanteously being stochastically severed and capped along their lengths , and disassembled from their pointed ends .

A ctin is a highly abundant cytosolic protein and poly - merizes to form dynamic ﬁlamentous networks that drive many biological processes , including cell morphogenesis , cell motility , endocytosis , and intracellular transport . Dynamic rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton are achieved through controlled nucleation and elongation of ﬁlaments from a ﬁnite pool of ATP - actin monomers . This is counterbalanced by rapid destabilization and disassembly of aged ( ADP ) ﬁlaments , which serves to both replenish the actin monomer pool and sculpt network geometry . We now have a mature understanding of how actin ﬁlament arrays are initially formed in cells , revolutionized by the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying actin ﬁlament nucleation and elongation 1 , 2 . In contrast , our understanding of how these networks are disassembled remains highly incomplete . The only well understood step in the disassembly process is ﬁlament severing . In a wide range of organisms this step is mediated by ADF / Coﬁlin ( hereafter referred to as Coﬁlin ) , which binds cooperatively to the sides of ADP - actin ﬁlaments and induces structural changes , leading to breaks between the Coﬁlin - decorated and undecorated regions 3 – 7 . Severing ampliﬁes the number of ﬁlament ends from which subunit dissociation can occur , thus reducing the time to full depolymerization . Despite these advances in our knowledge of how Coﬁlin severs ﬁlaments , a number of critical questions have remained unanswered . First , Coﬁlin alone binds surprisingly slowly to ADP - actin ﬁlaments ( k on ¼ 0 . 013 m M (cid:2) 1 s (cid:2) 1 ) , suggesting that additional cellular factors may be required to enhance Coﬁlin recruitment to F - actin for inducing rapid actin disassembly 8 , 9 . Second , even though Coﬁlin is present at concentrations of 5 – 20 m M in mammalian cells 10 – 12 , maximal severing by Coﬁlin in vitro was observed at nanomolar concentrations , and micromolar concentrations of Coﬁlin perplexingly led to over - decoration and stabilization of ﬁlaments 8 , 13 . Third , it has been unclear how actin polymerization is prevented at the new barbed ends of ﬁlaments generated by severing . Cells maintain high levels of ATP - actin monomers , B 2 orders of magnitude above the critical concentration for barbed end assembly , and thus cytosolic conditions strongly favour actin assembly over disassembly 14 , 15 . As a consequence , severing without simultaneous capping of barbed ends will result in net growth rather than disassembly 8 , 10 . Together , these observations suggest that additional cellular factors must work in concert with Coﬁlin to achieve highly efﬁcient severing and disassembly in vivo . Mounting genetic and biochemical evidence has implicated three proteins ( Srv2 / CAP , AIP1 and Coronin ) in functioning with Coﬁlin to promote actin disassembly in vivo . Yeast and mammalian homologues of Srv2 / CAP facilitate Coﬁlin - mediated actin disassembly by enhancing ﬁlament severing 4 – 8 fold 16 – 20 . However , the roles of AIP1 and Coronin are less well understood . AIP1 binds to F - actin and Coﬁlin , but it has remained controversial whether AIP1 enhances Coﬁlin - mediated severing and / or caps the barbed ends of ﬁlaments after severing 21 – 25 . The role of Coronin has been even more enigmatic , with ostensibly conﬂicting genetic and biochemical observations . While genetic data strongly support a role for Coronin in promoting actin turnover , puriﬁed yeast and mammalian Coronins both inhibit rather than enhance Coﬁlin - mediated severing in vitro 26 – 29 . Thus , the functions and mechanisms of AIP1 and Coronin in regulating actin disassembly have remained poorly understood . One of the important advances in our understanding of actin disassembly mechanisms came from the recent biochemical work of Brieher and co - workers 30 , 31 , who isolated Coﬁlin , AIP1 and Coronin from cell extracts as factors that together induce the disassembly of Listeria actin tails or puriﬁed actin ﬁlaments even under assembly - promoting conditions . These studies linked together for the ﬁrst time the functions of AIP1 and Coronin in Coﬁlin - mediated actin disassembly . Here we have employed multi - wavelength total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy to directly observe Coﬁlin , AIP1 and Coronin during actin ﬁlament severing and disassembly , and thus deﬁne better the roles of each protein and their collective mechanism for inducing rapid actin disassembly . Our study reveals that these three proteins work in a temporally ordered manner to rapidly disassemble F - actin . This process is initiated by binding of Coronin to ﬁlaments , which in turn greatly enhances Coﬁlin recruitment to ﬁlaments sides . Last to arrive is AIP1 , which invariably triggers severing . After inducing severing , AIP1 remains bound to the newly generated barbed ends , and together with Coﬁlin and Coronin blocks new growth , thus enabling ﬁlament disassembly even under assembly - promoting conditions . Results Rapid actin ﬁlament severing by a three - component mixture . To investigate how mammalian Coﬁlin - 1 ( referred to herein as Cof1 ) , AIP1 and Coronin - 1B ( referred to herein as Cor1B ) work together to regulate actin ﬁlament disassembly , we ﬁrst compared their individual and combined effects on severing of surface - tethered Oregon - green ( OG ) labelled ﬁlaments in TIRF assays . Using low micromolar concentrations of Cof1 combined with 10 - fold lower concentrations of Cor1B and AIP1 ( approximating the ratio found in cells 29 , 30 , 32 ) , we observed complete severing and disassembly of ﬁlaments ( 10 – 15 m m in length ) only 5 s after ﬂow - in ( Fig . 1a ; Supplementary Movie 1 ) . This precluded quantitative measurement of severing rates ; therefore we reduced the concentrations of Cof1 , AIP1 and Cor1B while maintaining the 10 : 1 : 1 ratio ( 150 nM , 15 nM and 15 nM , respectively ) , enabling differences in severing rates to be quantiﬁed . Under these conditions ( Fig . 1b , c ; Supplementary Movie 2 ; also see Supplementary Fig . 1 ) , Cof1 alone induced an average of two to three severing events per ﬁlament during the 300 s observation window . Further addition of AIP1 led to a modest but signiﬁcant ( P o 0 . 05 , one - way ANOVA ) increase in severing rate over the 300 - s observation period ( 1 . 9 ± 0 . 2 (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 4 breaks per m m per s for Cof1 versus 3 . 4 ± 0 . 45 (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 4 breaks per m m per s for Cof1 þ AIP1 , n ¼ 3 ) . In contrast , Cor1B strongly and signiﬁcantly ( P o 0 . 05 , one - way ANOVA ) inhibited severing by Cof1 ( 0 . 5 ± 0 . 1 (cid:3) 10 (cid:2) 4 breaks per m m per s , n ¼ 3 ) , consistent with its previously reported inhibitory effects in bulk assays 26 , 28 . In the absence of Cof1 , AIP1 and Cor1B each showed no severing activity ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . The most striking effects though were observed in the combined presence of all three proteins ( Cof1 , AIP1 and Cor1B ) , where greatly enhanced severing was observed at all time points ( Fig . 1c ) , and the maximal severing rate ( measured between 30 and 60 s after ﬂow - in ) was 10 - fold higher for the 3 - component mixture compared with Cof1 alone ( Fig . 1d ) . TIRF microscopy only provides limited information about the size of F - actin severing products , since many of them are below the resolution of light microscopy , and some of the untethered fragments diffuse away . Therefore , we incubated ﬁlaments for 10 min with Cof1 alone or the combination of Cof1 , AIP1 and Cor1B and examined the severing products by electron microscopy ( Fig . 1e ; also see Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Filaments incubated with Cof1 alone had an average length of 284 ± 115 nm ( n ¼ 256 ) , compared with control ﬁlaments of 6 , 184 ± 533 nm ( n ¼ 19 ) . Strikingly , ﬁlaments incubated with Cof1 and AIP1 had an average length of only 54 ± 18 nm or E 20 actin subunits ( n ¼ 323 ) .

All rights reserved . even shorter , with an average length of 32 ± 18 nm or E 12 actin subunits ( n ¼ 134 ) . Taken together with our TIRF analysis , these data show that while AIP1 alone only modestly increases the initial rate of Cof1 - mediated severing ( Fig . 1c , d ) , it dramatically reduces the average size of the severing end products after prolonged incubation . In contrast , the contribution of Cor1B appears to be primarily to increase the initial rate of severing by Cof1 and AIP1 ( Fig . 1c , d ) , while it only modestly affects the average size of the severing end products ( Fig . 1e ) . Coronin accelerates Coﬁlin binding to actin ﬁlaments . Next , we ﬂuorescently labelled Cof1 , AIP1 and Cor1B , so that we could observe each of them in real time during actin ﬁlament dis - assembly by multi - wavelength TIRF microscopy . For Cof1 , we reengineered its surface residues to leave only one exposed cysteine at a position where Cy3 - maleimide labelling did not interfere with function ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . For AIP1 and Cor1B , SNAP tags were introduced at their C termini , and the resulting fusion proteins were directly labelled with benzyl guanine - conjugated dyes in the far - red spectrum ( see Methods 0 1 2 3 4 2 µ M Cof1 + 0 . 2 µ M Cor1B + 0 . 2 µ M AIP1 5 6 7 8 9 s 20 µ m 150 nM Cof1 + 15 nM AIP1 150 nM Cof1 + 15 nM Cor1B 150 nM Cof1 + 15 nM Cor1B + 15 nM AIP1 150 nM Cof1 Cof1 + AIP1 + Cor1B Cof1 + AIP1 Cof1 Cof1 + Cor1B Actin 0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 s 0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 s 0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 s 0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 s 10 µ m 10 µ m 10 µ m 10 µ m 0 0 . 05 0 . 1 0 . 15 0 . 2 0 . 25 0 . 3 0 100 200 300 C u m u l a t i v e b r ea ks pe r µ m F - a c t i n Time after flow in ( s ) 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 M a x i m a l s e v e r i ng r a t e ( b r ea ks pe r µ m pe r m i n ) Cof1 Cof1Cor1B Cof1AIP1 Cof1AIP1Cor1B Cof1 Cof1AIP1 Cof1AIP1Cor1B * * * * * * * * * 0 100 200 300 400 Leng t h ( n m ) Electron microscopy N = 256 N = 323 N = 134 * * * * * * * * * N = 323 N = 134 * * * Figure 1 | High rates of actin ﬁlament severing in the combined presence of mammalian Cof1 , Cor1B and AIP1 .

The resulting proteins , Cy3 – Cof1 , Cor1B – SNAP649 and AIP1 – SNAP647 , had actin disassembly activities similar to unlabelled counterparts ( Supplementary Fig . 3b – d ) . We ﬁrst examined the kinetics of Cy3 – Cof1 binding to OG – actin ﬁlaments .

Further , Cy3 – Cof1 decoration led to ﬁlament severing , with breaks occurring between the decorated and undecorated regions ( Fig . 2a , yellow arrows ) . These results using mammalian Cof1 are consistent with those reported for yeast Cof1 ( ref . 7 ) , suggesting that the fundamental mechanism by which Coﬁlin interacts with and severs ﬁlaments is conserved between yeast and mammals . Addition of unlabelled Cor1B in TIRF reactions led to a dramatic increase in the rate of Cy3 – Cof1 binding to actin ﬁlaments , and produced heavily decorated , hyper - stabilized ﬁlaments ( Fig . 2a , b ; Supplementary Movie 3 ) . Kymographs revealed an increase in the Cy3 – Cof1 spot density on ﬁlaments in the presence of Cor1B relative to that observed in the absence of Cor1B ( Fig . 2c , d ) . Each Cy3 – Cof1 patch followed a similar pattern , starting as a small dot and gradually increasing in intensity and often merging with other patches . These results show that Cor1B markedly accelerates Cy3 – Cof1 binding to ﬁlaments . By comparison , AIP1 had little if any effect on the kinetics of Cy3 – Cof1 binding to ﬁlaments ( Fig . 2f ; Supplementary Movie 3 ) . However , AIP1 had a profound effect on severing in the combined presence of Cor1B and Cy3 – Cof1 , inducing rapid fragmentation of ﬁlaments , including those heavily decorated by Cy3 – Cof1 ( Fig . 2e , f ) . Quantiﬁcation of Cy3 – Cof1 recruitment to ﬁlaments in the presence of AIP1 and Cor1B showed that AIP1 does not alter the kinetics of Cy3 – Cof1 recruitment by Cor1B ( Fig . 2f ; Supplementary Movie 3 ) . Taken together , these observations suggest the following : ( 1 ) Cof1 binding to actin ﬁlaments is one of the rate - limiting steps in severing ; ( 2 ) Cof1 binding is accelerated greatly by Cor1B and ( 3 ) the presence of AIP1 strongly enhances severing after Cof1 decoration . Coronin binds rapidly to actin ﬁlaments preceding Coﬁlin . To better understand the spatiotemporal relationship between Cor1B and Cof1 binding to ﬁlaments , we next performed three - colour TIRF microscopy to simultaneously observe binding of Cy3 – Cof1 and Cor1B – SNAP649 to OG – actin ﬁlaments ( Fig . 3a ; Supplementary Movie 4 ) . Cor1B – SNAP649 appeared on ﬁla - ments rapidly , even faster than the appearance of Cy3 – Cof1 accelerated by the presence of Cor1B – SNAP649 ( Fig . 3b ) . Further , at the ﬁrst observed binding location on a ﬁlament , Cor1B – SNAP649 almost always arrived ahead of Cy3 – Cof1 ( 90 % of the time ; blue bars in upper panel Fig . 3c ) . As shown by a randomized control analysis ( lower panel , Fig . 3c ) , this behaviour was not merely a coincidence , caused by faster appearance of Cor1B – SNAP649 on ﬁlaments . Instead , the data show that there was a tendency for Cy3 – Cof1 to bind where Cor1B – SNAP649 was already bound . Further , we often observed that following Cy3 – Cof1 recruitment , the Cor1B – SNAP649 signal at these sites would decline , suggesting that Cof1 might be able to displace Cor1B . Analysis of randomly chosen individual Cor1B – SNAP649 spots on ﬁlaments , showed that in the absence of Cy3 – Cof1 , the Cor1B – SNAP649 average ﬂuorescence peaked and remained constant ( Fig . 3e ; Supplementary Fig . 4a , c ) . However , in the presence of Cy3 – Cof1 , the Cor1B – SNAP649 average ﬂuorescence peaked and then slowly decreased , suggesting that accumulation of Cof1 may displace Cor1B – SNAP649 from these sites ( Fig . 3d , e ; Supplementary Fig . 4b ) . Altogether , these results suggest a pre - ferentially ordered pathway , in which Cor1B typically binds to ﬁlaments ﬁrst and then recruits Cof1 to the same sites , providing a means by which the otherwise slow association of Cof1 with ﬁlaments is greatly accelerated . AIP1 is recruited by Coﬁlin and triggers ﬁlament severing . To investigate the spatiotemporal relationship of AIP1 and Cof1 binding to ﬁlaments , we performed three - colour TIRF micro - scopy experiments as above , except using AIP1 – SNAP647 , Cy3 – Cof1 and OG – actin ﬁlaments , with and without unlabelled Cor1B ( Fig . 4a – c , Supplementary Fig . 5 and Supplementary Movie 5 ) . For these experiments , we used a low concentration of AIP1 – SNAP647 ( 5 nM ) to reduce background ﬂuorescence in the TIRF images , which was required to enable single - molecule observations . We quantiﬁed the frequency of AIP1 – SNAP647 binding events on ﬁlaments with and without Cof1 . The AIP1 – SNAP647 spots we observed on ﬁlaments were likely single molecules , as 90 % of surface - adsorbed AIP1 – SNAP647 spots photobleached in a single step ( Fig . 4d , e ) . AIP1 – SNAP647 binding to ﬁlaments was approximately fourfold higher in the presence of Cof1 and sixfold higher in the combined presence of Cof1 and Cor1B ( Fig . 4f ) . These results are consistent with pre - vious studies showing that AIP1 alone has low afﬁnity for actin ﬁlaments ( 2 – 3 m M ) , but that its association with F - actin is enhanced by Cof1 ( refs 22 , 33 , 34 ) . We also observed that AIP1 – SNAP647 binding always occured at sites where Cy3 – Cof1 was already bound . Together , these observations suggest that Cof1 plays an important role in recruiting AIP1 to ﬁlament sides . In addition , we observed that 4 90 % of the observed events in which AIP1 – SNAP647 appeared on ﬁlaments were rapidly followed by severing in the presence of Cof1 , with or without Cor1B ( Fig . 4g , h ) . The average time interval between binding of AIP1 – SNAP647 and ﬁlament severing was 9 s ( 95 % conﬁdence interval ( CI ) ( 5 , 17 ) ) in the absence of Cor1B , and this did not change signiﬁcantly in the presence of Cor1B ( 6 s ( 5 , 8 ) ) . In most instances ( 56 of 63 events ) AIP1 – SNAP647 was also observed to remain bound to one of the new ﬁlament ends produced by severing ( Fig . 4a – c , Supplementary Fig . 5 and Supplementary Movie 5 ) . The average dwell time of AIP1 – SNAP647 on severed ends was slightly longer in the presence of Cof1 and Cor1B ( 29 . 11 s ; 95 % CI ( 27 . 71 , 30 . 66 ) ) compared with Cof1 alone ( 19 . 54 s ; 95 % CI ( 18 . 72 , 20 . 45 ) ) ( Fig . 4i ) . Capping at severed ends requires the three - component mixture . As mentioned earlier ( see Introduction ) , cytosolic conditions strongly favour actin assembly over disassembly because of the high concentration of ATP - actin monomers . For this reason , cells require a mechanism for efﬁcient capping or blocking of new barbed ends generated by severing ; otherwise , severing will promote increased growth rather than disassembly . To address whether Cof1 , Cor1B and / or AIP1 can block actin polymerization at newly generated barbed ends after severing , we developed a two - colour actin assay , in which we ﬁrst polymerized and tethered DY647 - labelled actin ﬁlaments , then replaced the solution by ﬂow - in with a mixture of OG – actin monomers , proﬁlin and different concentrations of Cof1 , Cor1B and / or AIP1 ( Fig . 5 ; Supplementary Movie 6 ) . Under each condition , the original barbed end ( white arrows , Fig . 5a ) continued to polymerize , indicated by the appearance of new ( green ) polymer . In the pre - sence of Cof1 , Cof1 and AIP1 , or Cof1 and Cor1B , polymerization was also observed at nearly all of the barbed ends generated by severing ( yellow arrows in Fig . 5a , b ; Supplementary Movie 6 ) . In striking contrast , polymerization was rarely observed at barbed ends generated by severing in the presence of Cof1 , Cor1B and AIP1 ( Fig . 5a – c ; Supplementary Movie 6 ) . These observations show that efﬁcient obstruction of new growth at barbed ends generated by severing requires the combination of all three proteins—Cof1 , Cor1B and AIP1 . Further , they show that these proteins do not block polymerization at the original , growing barbed end , and thus their ability to inhibit barbed end growth may be closely coupled to severing .

Filaments were observed to polymerize at their barbed ends at approximately fourfold accelerated rate expected for this formin in the presence of proﬁlin 38 , while being severed along their length ( Fig . 6a ; Supplementary Movie 7 ) . Cor1B – SNAP649 was observed to bind rapidly to the newly polymerized regions of the ﬁlaments , leaving only a short undecorated region behind the growing barbed end ( white arrows , Fig . 6a ) . Cy3 – Cof1 binding followed behind Cor1B – SNAP649 binding , in agreement with our kinetic analysis on preassembled ﬁlaments ( Fig . 3b ) . Severing events correlated with sites of Cy3 – Cof1 decoration ( yellow arrows , Fig . 6a ) , and the fragments released by severing did not polymerize but rather disassembled ( presumably from their pointed ends ) , despite the assembly - promoting conditions . We also took advantage of this system to analyse the association of AIP1 – SNAP647 with ﬁlament ends after severing because the growing barbed ends could be unambiguously identiﬁed ( Fig . 6b ; Supplementary Movie 8 ) . This conﬁrmed that AIP1 – SNAP647 was recruited to sites of Cy3 – Cof1 decoration on ﬁlaments , and that binding of AIP1 – SNAP647 almost invariably led to severing ( 33 / 34 events for AIP1 and Cof1 ; 54 / 56 events for D Y 647 f il a m en t Time Cof1 + AIP1 M e r ge D Y 647 Cof1 + AIP1 + Cor1B C o f 1 Barbed end created by severing C o f 1 A I P 1 C o f 1 C o r 1 B C o f 1 + C o r 1 B A I P 1 DY647 - actin 1 µ M OG – actin + 5 µ M Profilin + proteins 90 180 270 s 0 90 180 270 s 0 90 180 270 s 0 90 180 270 s 0 Barbed end Barbed end created by severing Flow in Cof1 Cof1 + Cor1B Time Flow in OG M e r ge D Y 647 OG * * * * * * * * * M e r ge D Y 647 OG M e r ge D Y 647 D Y 647 f il a m en t OG Flow in Flow in 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 67 / 70 64 / 67 18 / 19 2 / 48 C o f 1 + C o r 1 B + A I P 1 C o f 1 + C o r 1 B C o f 1 + A I P 1 C o f 1 F r a c t i on o f s e v e r ed end s t ha t g r o w 10 µ m 2 / 48 B Figure 5 | Growth at barbed ends generated by severing is blocked speciﬁcally by the combination of Cor1B , Cof1 and AIP1 .

However , Cor1B substantially increased the average dwell time of AIP1 – SNAP647 on ﬁlament barbed ends after severing , from 66 . 94 s for Cof1 and AIP1 ( 95 % CI ( 61 . 41 , 73 . 56 ) ) to 137 . 4 s for Cof1 , AIP1 and Cor1B ( 95 % CI ( 128 . 3 , 147 . 9 ) ) ( Fig . 6b , d ) . These results help explain why all three proteins are required for efﬁcient obstruction of growth at barbed ends generated by severing ( Fig . 5 ) , although they do not rule out additional mechanistic contributions from Cor1B . Together , these experiments using actively growing ﬁlaments validate the key aspects of the Cor1B – Cof1 – AIP1 mechanism observed above using preassembled ﬁlaments , and demonstrate that ﬁlament treadmilling can be reconstituted in vitro under assembly - promoting conditions . Discussion In this study , we have used multi - wavelength TIRF microscopy to directly visualize the integrated actions of Coronin , Coﬁlin and AIP1 during the process of actin ﬁlament severing and disassembly . Our results reveal that Coronin , Coﬁlin and AIP1 arrive sequentially on ﬁlaments ( the majority of the time in that order ) and that each protein plays a key role in recruiting the next one and makes a distinct contribution to inducing highly rapid ﬁlament disassembly . These ﬁndings resolve several long - stand - ing dilemmas about the functions and mechanisms of Coronin , Coﬁlin and AIP1 , and provide new insights into how cells induce rapid destabilization and disassembly of actin ﬁlaments under assembly - promoting conditions . They also highlight the impor - tance of studying the activities of groups of proteins , rather than individual ones , to deﬁne their roles and mechanisms in biological processes . The mechanism we have deﬁned may be used by cells to induce the highly rapid disassembly of ﬁlaments in locations such as the leading edge of cells and sites of endocytosis , where ﬁlament turnover is observed to occur in 5 – 20 s ( refs 36 , 37 ) . Indeed , we observed complete disassembly only a few seconds after we exposed preassembled B 10 m m long ﬁlaments to a mixture of Cor1B , Cof1 and AIP1 at their estimated cellular ratios and close to their estimated cellular concentrations . The highly rapid actin ﬁlament disassembly using near cellular concentrations of Cor1B , Cof1 and AIP1 also demonstrates that the three proteins acting together overcome many of the limitations reported for Coﬁlin alone ( see Introduction ) , including delayed severing due to slow binding of Coﬁlin to ﬁlaments , and sub - optimal severing at high ( micromolar ) concentrations compared with that seen at low ( nanomolar ) concentrations of Coﬁlin 8 , 9 . By lowering the concentrations of Cor1B , Cof1 and AIP1 , while maintaining their cellular ratio , we were able to quantify the contributions of each protein to the three - part mechanism , and to directly observe each protein acting on ﬁlaments during disassembly . In our system , Cof1 , Cor1B and AIP1 did not cause ﬁlaments to disassemble in bursts , as described by Kueh et al . 31 ; however , there are differences in the experimental designs which could account for the different results ( see Methods ) . Our experiments using labelled Coronin and Coﬁlin expose critical aspects of their spatiotemporal relationship , and resolve several long - standing dilemmas . First , they show that the slow binding of Coﬁlin to ﬁlaments is accelerated dramatically by Coronin , demonstrating that this slow step in severing can be enhanced by co - factors , and may be regulated in vivo . In addition , we observed that Coﬁlin is recruited to sites on ﬁlaments where Coronin is already bound . Precisely how this is achieved is not yet clear , but may involve Coronin altering the conformation of F - actin and / or providing additional contacts for Coﬁlin on ﬁlaments . Indeed , recent cryo - electron microscopy studies show that Coﬁlin and Coronin occupy closely juxtaposed sites on ADP - actin ﬁlaments and may be in direct contact 4 , 38 . Coronin could have additional effects on the nucleotide state of F - actin , for example , in promoting P i release , but our observation that Coronin dramatically recruits Coﬁlin to preassembled ﬁlaments , which should be composed entirely of ADP - actin subunits , argues that Coronin most likely recruits Coﬁlin to ADP - actin ﬁlaments by providing additional contacts and / or inducing subtle changes in F - actin conformation that favour Coﬁlin binding . A second issue resolved by our data is the seemingly paradoxical observation that , despite multiple lines of genetic evidence suggesting that Coronin promotes actin disassembly in vivo , Coronin alone inhibits rather than enhancing Coﬁlin - mediated severing in vitro 26 , 28 . We observed that Coronin accelerates Coﬁlin recruitment to ﬁlaments , both in the presence or absence of AIP1 , but that without AIP1 this leads to over - decoration and hyper - stabilization of ﬁlaments by Coﬁlin . However , in the added presence of AIP1 it leads to strongly enhanced severing and disassembly . Thus , Coronin biochemically stimulates Coﬁlin - mediated actin disassembly speciﬁcally in the presence of AIP1 . We also made the observation that AIP1 ( without Coronin ) only marginally improves the severing efﬁciency of Coﬁlin . This suggests that in addition to recruiting Coﬁlin to ﬁlaments , Coronin binding to ﬁlaments greatly enhances severing by AIP1 and Cof1 . Moreover , after severing , Coronin increased the dwell time of AIP1 on barbed ends generated by severing , and was critical for blocking growth at those ends . Thus , Coronin makes multiple mechanistic contributions to promoting actin ﬁlament disassembly , and each of these roles is highly integrated with the functions of Coﬁlin and AIP1 . Our data also shed important light on the long - standing debate over the AIP1 mechanism in actin disassembly . A role for AIP1 in capping barbed ends of severed ﬁlaments has been supported by genetic interactions between AIP1 and capping protein 39 – 41 , live - imaging analysis of green ﬂuorescent protein – AIP1 speckles at the leading edge 42 and speciﬁc biochemical observations 21 , 25 , 39 . However , a different set of biochemical studies reported enhanced Coﬁlin - mediated severing in the presence of AIP1 , but saw no clear evidence of barbed end capping 12 , 23 , 43 . Our observations resolve these discrepancies . We found that low concentrations of AIP1 ( 10 – 15 nM ) were insufﬁcient to cap the newly generated barbed ends . On the other hand , in the presence of Cor1B ( 10 – 15 nM ) , 10 – 15 nM AIP1 strongly enhances severing by Coﬁlin , but also capped the severed ends . Thus , our results show that low concentrations of AIP1 and Cor1B can together promote actin disassembly by both mechanisms , that is , enhancing severing and capping / blocking the new barbed ends generated by severing . This may explain why some previous studies ( which did not include Coronin , and used different protocols and protein concentrations ) did not observe barbed end capping . Using direct imaging of labelled molecules on actin ﬁlaments , we also observed that Coﬁlin recruited AIP1 to ﬁlament sides , and on binding invariably induced severing . AIP1 remained attached to the barbed end after severing , and the presence of Cor1B substantially increased the AIP1 dwell time on the severed end . Taken together , these data demonstrate unequivocally that AIP1 both enhances Coﬁlin severing and caps barbed ends generated by severing , but the efﬁciency of both effects of AIP1 are modulated by Coronin . Since the strongest severing activity that we observed occurred in the combined presence of Coronin , Coﬁlin and AIP1 , a future challenge will be to understand the structural basis for how these three proteins simultaneously interact with ﬁlaments . As men - tioned above , Coronin and Coﬁlin appear to bind adjacent sites ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms8202 10 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 6 : 7202 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms8202 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications & 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

In addition , it is yet to be determined precisely how AIP1 binding to a Coﬁlin - decorated region of a ﬁlament triggers severing . This may involve AIP1 displacing one or more Cof1 molecules from a patch to generate a local discontinuity that destabilizes ﬁlaments 44 , or AIP1 displacing one of Coﬁlin’s two binding interactions with F - actin 45 . Finally , it will be important to study if and how Coﬁlin , Coronin and AIP1 work alongside other actin disassembly factors , for example , Srv2 / CAP , GMF and possibly Twinﬁlin 16 , 18 , 46 , 47 . GMF binds with high afﬁnity to Arp2 / 3 complex and stimulates ﬁlament debranching . Srv2 / CAP binds to ﬁlaments , independently of Coﬁlin , and enhances severing not by accelerating Coﬁlin recruitment but instead by reducing the time from Coﬁlin binding to severing 16 – 18 . These mechanistic effects are distinct from , and possibly complementary to , those we have deﬁned here for Coronin and AIP1 : Coronin accelerates the recruitment of Coﬁlin ; AIP1 is recruited to ﬁlaments by Coﬁlin and greatly enhances severing ; and all three ( Coﬁlin , AIP1 and Coronin ) together cap severed barbed ends . Thus , each of these conserved proteins may have distinct capabilities in promoting actin ﬁlament disassembly , providing cells with a diverse tool kit with which the actin networks can be locally tuned and shaped , tailoring their architectures and dynamics for a wide range of functions . Methods Plasmids . A plasmid for expressing mouse Cor1B with a C - terminal 8His tag in mammalian cells ( vector pTT5SH8Q2 ) was kindly provided by Dr Jim Bear ( University of North Carolina ) . A plasmid carrying mouse AIP1 was kindly provided by Dr Naoki Watanabe ( the Tohoku University ) , and the insert was cloned into the same mamalian expression vector as Cor1B . Plasmids for expressing Cor1B – SNAP and AIP1 – SNAP were generated by cloning a SNAP - tag at the C terminus of each protein in the same expression vectors as above . The plasmid for expressing human Cof1 in Escherichia coli was generously provided by Dr David Kovar ( the University of Chicago ) . For ﬂuorescent labelling of human Cof1 , a mutagenesis strategy was followed , related to that used to label yeast Cof1 ( ref . 16 ) , in which the following substitutions were introduced by site - directed mutagenesis : C139A , C147A , C39S and T63C . All constructs were veriﬁed by DNA sequencing . Protein puriﬁcation and ﬂuorescent labelling . Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was puriﬁed as described 48 . In brief , rabbit skeletal muscle actin was puriﬁed ﬁrst by generating an acetone powder from ground muscle tissue , which was stored in aliquots at (cid:2) 80 (cid:2) C . Aliquots of acetone powder were then pulverized using a coffee grinder , resuspended in G - buffer and cleared by low speed centrifugation . The actin was polymerized overnight and then pelleted . The pellet was disrupted by douncing , dialyzed against G - buffer for 2 – 3 days , and then gel ﬁltered on a 16 / 60 S200 column ( GE Healthcare Biosciences , Pittsburgh , PA ) . Column fractions were stored at 4 (cid:2) C . Actin was labelled on Cys374 with either OG maleimide or DY647 maleimide ( Dyomics , Jena , Germany ) , as described in the study by Kuhn and Pollard 49 . Brieﬂy , monomeric actin reconstituted from an actin pellet was dialyzed against two changes of G - buffer without DTT for 1h each . After clariﬁcation at 500 g for 5min , actin was polymerized by mixing an equal volume of cold 2 (cid:3) label buffer ( 2 (cid:3) ¼ 50mM imidazole , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 2 M KCl , 4mM MgCl2 , 6mM NaN3 AND 0 . 6mM ATP ) . After 5min polymerized actin was diluted to 1mgml (cid:2) 1 with cold 1 (cid:3) label buffer , then a 10 - fold molar excess of OG or DY647 maleimide was added dropwise to the actin while stirring , and the solution was stirred gently overnight . Labelled actin was clariﬁed at 500 g for 5min and centrifuged at 105 g for 2h to pellet actin ﬁlaments . The pellet was resuspended in G - buffer by douncing , dialyzed for 2 days against two changes of G - buffer and gel ﬁltered on a 16 / 60 S200 column . Peak fractions were combined and stored at (cid:2) 20 (cid:2) C . Labelling efﬁciency of OG – actin was measured by absorbance at 290 and 491nm , and extinction coefﬁcient E 491 ¼ 77 , 800M (cid:2) 1 cm (cid:2) 1 . Labelling efﬁciency of DY647 – actin was measured by absorbance at 290 and 653nm , and extinction coefﬁcient E 653 ¼ 250 , 000M (cid:2) 1 cm (cid:2) 1 . The absorption at 290nm was corrected for background ﬂuorescence from the dye ( correction factor 0 . 016991 for OG – actin and 0 . 024 for DY647 – actin ) . The formin Daam1 ( 6his - FH1 - FH2 - C ) was inducibly expressed in yeast , and puriﬁed by sequential Ni 2 þ - NTA and gel ﬁltration chromatography steps 35 . Cor1B and AIP1 were expressed and puriﬁed from transfected HEK293T cells ( ATCC ) . Cells were grown on plates at 37 (cid:2) C under a humidiﬁed atmosphere containing 5 % CO 2 in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium , supplemented with 10 % ( v / v ) heat - inactivated foetal bovine serum , glucose ( 4 . 5gl (cid:2) 1 ) , penicillin ( 100Uml (cid:2) 1 ) and streptomycin ( 100 m gml (cid:2) 1 ) . Cells at 30 – 40 % conﬂuence were transiently transfected using 25kDa linear polyethylenimine ( Polysciences , Warrington , PA ) . About 72h post transfection , cells were harvested in PBS , pelleted by centrifugation at 1 , 000 g for 5min and lysed by repeated freeze - thawing in 20mM Tris / HCl pH 7 . 5 , 150mM NaCl , 1 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 and a standard cocktail of protease inhibitors ( Roche , Germany ) . After a 30min incubation on ice , cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20 , 000 g at 4 (cid:2) C using an eppendorf tabletop centrifuge and incubated with Ni 2 þ - NTA beads ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA ) for 90min at 4 (cid:2) C in the presence of 10mM imidazole . After washing with Buffer A ( 20mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 300mM NaCl , 50mM imidazole and 1mM DTT ) , proteins were eluted in Buffer A supplemented with 250mM imidazole , concentrated and puriﬁed further on a Superose 6 gel ﬁltration column ( GE Healthcare ) equilibrated in Buffer B ( 20mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 50mM KCl and 1mM DTT ) . For ﬂuorescent labelling of SNAP - tagged proteins , the fusion proteins were bound to Ni 2 þ - NTA beads , washed extensively in PBS with 1mM DTT and incubated with a ﬁvefold excess of benzylguanine or benzylchloropyrimidine SNAP - Surface 649 ( New England Biolabs , Ipswich , MA ) for 2h at room temperature . Next , beads were washed extensively in PBS with 1mM DTT and eluted in PBS with 250mM imidazole . To remove free dye , proteins were exchanged into Buffer B on PD - 10 columns ( GE Healthcare Biosciences ) . Cor1B – SNAP was ﬁrst labelled with SNAP - Surface Alexa Fluor 647 ( New England Biolabs ) , but this preparation showed severe non - speciﬁc binding to slides in TIRF microscopy assays . This issue was overcome by labelling of Cor1B with SNAP - Surface 649 . A labelling efﬁciency of 30 % was obtained for Cor1B – SNAP649 and AIP1 – SNAP647 . Labelling efﬁciencies were determined spectrophotometrically using the absorbance at 650nm and an extinction coefﬁcient of 250 , 000M (cid:2) 1 cm (cid:2) 1 for SNAP - SNAP - Surface Alexa Fluor 647 or Surface 649 , combined with absorbance at 280nm and an estimated extinction coefﬁcient of 82 , 850M (cid:2) 1 cm (cid:2) 1 for Cor1B – SNAP or 118 , 720M (cid:2) 1 cm (cid:2) 1 for AIP1 – SNAP . The absorption at 280nm was corrected for background ﬂuorescence from the dye ( correction factor 0 . 024 ) . Human Cof1 was expressed in BL21 ( DE3 ) E . coli by growing cells at 37 (cid:2) C in TB medium to log phase , then inducing expression with 1mM isopropyl b - D - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside at 18 (cid:2) C for 16h . Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at (cid:2) 80 (cid:2) C , then lysed by sonication in 20mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 50mM NaCl , 1mM DTT and protease inhibitors . Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 30 , 000 g for 20min in a Fiberlite F13 - 14X50CY rotor ( Thermo Scientiﬁc , Rockport , Illinois ) , and applied to a 5ml HiTrap HP Q column ( GE Healthcare Biosciences ) . The ﬂow - through containing Cof1 was collected and dialyzed into 20mM Hepes pH 6 . 8 , 25mM NaCl and 1mM DTT . Next , the protein was applied to a 5ml HiTrap SP FF column ( GE Healthcare Biosciences ) and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl ( 25 to 500mM ) . Fractions containing Cof1 were concentrated and dialyzed into Buffer B , aliquoted , snap - frozen in liquid N 2 and stored at (cid:2) 80 (cid:2) C until use . Dye - labelled Cof1 was puriﬁed similarly except that the protein was eluted from the SP FF column with PBS , and then incubated with a 10 - fold excess of Cy3 - maleimide ( GE Healthcare Biosciences ) for 2h at room temperature in the presence of 0 . 3mM TCEP . Excess dye was removed by passing the protein over a PD - 10 column equilibrated in Buffer B . Final labelling efﬁciency was 30 % . Labelling efﬁciency was determined as described above , using absorbance at 550nm and an extinction coefﬁcient of 150 , 000M (cid:2) 1 cm (cid:2) 1 for Cy3 , combined with absorbance at 280nm and an estimated extinction coefﬁcient of 14 , 440M (cid:2) 1 cm (cid:2) 1 for Cof1 . TIRF microscopy . For all experiments , coverslips were ﬁrst cleaned by sonication in detergent for 60min , followed by successive sonications in 1M KOH and 1M HCl for 20min each , then sonication in ethanol for at least 60min . Coverslips were then washed extensively with H 2 O , dried in an N 2 stream , layered with 200 m l of 80 % ethanol pH 2 . 0 , 2mgml (cid:2) 1 PEG – silane and 2 m gml (cid:2) 1 biotin – PEG – silane ( Laysan Bio Inc . , Arab , AL ) and incubated for 16h at 70 (cid:2) C . Flow cells were assembled by rinsing PEG - coated coverslips extensively with H 2 O , and then by attaching them to a ﬂow chamber ( Ibidi , Martinsried , Germany ) using double - sided tape ( 2 . 5cm (cid:3) 2mm (cid:3) 120 m m ) and epoxy resin . For all TIRF experiments in this study except for those shown in Fig . 6 , the actin ﬁlaments were tethered . To accomplish this , ﬂow cells were incubated for 3min with HBSA ( HEK buffer with 1 % BSA ) , followed by 30s incubation with 0 . 1mgml (cid:2) 1 Streptavidin in HEK buffer . Flow cells were washed HBSA and equilibrated with TIRF buffer ( 10mM imidazole pH 7 . 4 , 50mM KCl , 1mM MgCl 2 , 1mM EGTA , 0 . 2mM ATP , 10mM DTT , 15mM glucose , 20 m gml (cid:2) 1 catalase , 100 m gml (cid:2) 1 glucose oxidase and 0 . 5 % methylcellulose ( 4 , 000cP ) ) . Reactions were initiated by rapidly diluting actin monomers ( 1 m M ﬁnal , 10 % OG labelled , 0 . 5 % biotinylated ) into TIRF buffer , followed by transferring that mixture into a ﬂow chamber . After ﬁlaments had polymerized to lengths of B 10 – 15 m m , the reaction mixture was replaced with TIRF buffer containing the indicated proteins . For assays using two differentially labelled actin preparations , ﬁlaments were ﬁrst polymerized as above using 1 m M actin ( 10 % DY647 - labelled and 0 . 5 % biotinylated ) , then the reaction mixture was replaced by ﬂow - in with TIRF buffer containing 1 m M actin ( 10 % OG labelled and 0 . 5 % biotinylated ) and the indicated proteins . To induce a manageable severing rate that allows one to follow ﬁlament growth at severed ends without over - crowding the ﬁeld with ﬁlaments , different concentrations of Cof1 , Cor1B and AIP1 were used in each condition . Concentrations were as follows : 250nM Cof1 alone , 250nM Cof1 þ 25nM Cor1B , 100nM Cof1 þ 10nM AIP1 , 75nM Cof1 þ 7 . 5nM AIP1 þ 7 . 5nM Cor1B . For experiments in Fig . 6 , non - attached ﬁlaments ( no biotin - actin ) were polymerized in TIRF buffer containing 2 % dextran NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms8202 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 6 : 7202 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms8202 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 11 & 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved . instead of 0 . 5 % methylcellulose as the crowding agent , which minimized ﬁlament diffusion . Single - and multi - wavelength time - lapse TIRF imaging were performed using a Nikon - Ti200 inverted microscope equipped with a 150mW Ar - Laser ( Mellot Griot , Carlsbad , CA ) , a TIRF - objective with a numerical aperture of 1 . 49 ( Nikon Instruments Inc . , New York , NY ) and an EMCCD camera ( Andor Ixon , Belfast , Northern Ireland ) . During measurements , optimal focus was maintained by the perfect focus system ( Nikon Instruments Inc . ) . For single - molecule photo - bleaching of AIP1 – SNAP647 , ﬂow cells were assembled using uncoated , acid - washed coverslips and washed with HBSA . Next , 0 . 4nM AIP1 – SNAP647 was ﬂowed in ( in TIRF buffer without glucose oxidase and catalase ) , and after a 5 - min incubation the adsorbed spots were exposed to continuous illumination at high laser power , and images were acquired every 0 . 5s . As noted in the Discussion , in our experiments Cof1 , Cor1B and AIP1 did not cause ﬁlaments to disassemble in bursts , as reported by Kueh et al . 31 . However , there are two major differences in the experimental design between the studies . First , there are differences in the ﬁlament attachment mode . In most of our reactions , we incorporated a low percentage ( 0 . 5 % ) of biotin - actin into ﬁlaments and attached them to the surface using streptavidin . In other experiments ( for example , our treadmilling assays in Fig . 6 ) we used untethered ﬁlaments . In both cases , we did not observe a burst of disassembly at ﬁlament ends . In constrast , Kueh and colleagues tethered ﬁlaments using ﬁlamin , raising the possibility that the bursting is promoted by this mode of attachment , and indeed Kueh et al . observed less bursting when ﬁlaments were tethered instead with N - ethylmaleimide - inactivated myosin . Second , the two studies used different actin - labelling strategies . Kueh and colleagues assembled ﬁlaments with a relatively high percentage of labelled actin ( 30 % ) . Further , they used actin monomers that were labelled heterogenously on exposed lysines ; thus , each monomer could have multiple dye molecules attached at different locations . In contrast , we used a substantially lower percentage of labelled actin ( 10 % OG – actin ) , in which the dye molecules uniformly labelled on Cys 374 , so that there was only one dye molecule per actin . This strategy limits the formation of photo - induced actin dimers , which is reported to cause ‘pausing’ in actin ﬁlament depolymerization 50 . TIRF data analysis . All TIRF data was analysed using ImageJ software ( NIH , Bethesda , MD ) . Before each analysis , the background was subtracted using the standard background subtraction tool ( rolling ball radius 50 pixels ) . Severing rates were calculated by measuring the initial lengths of ﬁlaments before ﬂow - in , and counting severing events observed during the next 300s after ﬂow - in of the indi - cated protein combinations . For binding of Cy3 – Coﬁlin and Cor1B – SNAP , the OG – actin ﬁlaments were ﬁrst traced ( at 488nm ) over time using the Plot Z - axis proﬁle tool , and then the trace was saved as a region - of - interest and used to determine the corresponding ﬂuorescence proﬁles in other channels . After cor - rection for bleed through between the Cy3 and SNAP649 channels , ﬂuorescence in all channels was normalized to the OG – actin signal . Fluorescent traces at speciﬁc time points were obtained in a similar manner , except that they were additionally normalized to the highest signal detected in the indicated channel . The same approach was followed to monitor the change in Cor1B – SNAP649 ﬂuorescence for three different regions of 4 (cid:3) 4 pixels per ﬁlament , as shown in Fig . 3d , e , and Supplementary Fig . S4b , c . The appearance of Cor1B – SNAP649 and Cy3 – Cof1 were scored by eye and conﬁrmed by obtaining the ﬂuorescent traces in both channels at the time of detection as described above . Subsequently , ﬁlaments were observed until the ﬁrst sight of a molecule in the other channel . For kinetic analysis , mea - sured time intervals ( Fig . 4h ) were ﬁt to an exponential model using maximum likelihood methods , and ﬁt parameter conﬁdence intervals were estimated by bootstrapping 51 . Other statistical analyses and curve ﬁttings ( Figs 4i and 6d ) were performed with Prism 5 . 0 . Electron microscopy . Skeletal muscle Ca - ATP - G actin ( 24 m M ) was polymerized by addition of inorganic salts ( 2mM MgCl 2 and 50mM KCl ) for 1h at 25 (cid:2) C . Then F - actin was diluted to 2 m M in F - buffer ( 50mM KCl , 2mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2mM EGTA , 1mM DTT and 5mM Tris , pH 8 ) and incubated for 10min at 25 (cid:2) C with one or more of the following proteins : 2 m M Coﬁlin , 0 . 2 m M AIP1 and / or 0 . 2 m M Cor1B . Samples were diluted another twofold in F - buffer and droplets ( 5 – 7 m l ) were applied for 20 – 30s to glow - discharged formvar - carbon - coated 200 mesh copper grids , then the grids were blotted to remove excess solution , negatively stained with 1 % ( w / v ) uranyl acetate for 1min , blotted again and allowed to air dry . Images were recorded on a CCD camera using a FEI Morgani 268 transmission electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 80kV and at magniﬁcations of 5 , 600 , 8 , 900 and 18 , 000 . For measurement of ﬁlament lengths , pictures at magniﬁcations of 5 , 600 or 8 , 900 were used , and micrographs from adjacent areas ( 7 – 15 images ) on the grid were combined into one picture using Adobe Photoshop . The contour traces of each ﬁlament were measured using the ruler tool in Adobe Photoshop . References 1 . Campellone , K . G . & Welch , M . D .
