Introduction Lamellipodia are cell protrusions functioning as essential parts of the machinery for crawling of many different cell types ( Small et al . , 2002 ) . They are thin , sheet - like structures densely ﬁlled with ﬁlamentous actin . Actin ﬁlaments are ﬂexible double helices with a diameter of approximately 7 nm that can form networks and bundles regulated by a large number of different proteins , performing the tasks of nucleation , branching , and cross - linking . The lamellipodia network interlinks to the extra - cellular matrix by transmembrane proteins and undergoes a permanent remodel - ing process by polymerization and depolymerization of ﬁlaments . These characteristics of actin networks allow cells to exert a direc - ted protrusive force ( Pollard and Cooper , 2009 ) . In their pioneering studies , Medalia et al . ( 2002 ) showed that electron tomography may be used to visualize actin ﬁlaments in thin regions of amoeba in vitreous ice , opening the way for three - dimensional analysis of actin networks in motile cells . More recently , tomograms were obtained from lamellipodia in cytoskel - etons of vertebrate cells contrasted by the negative stain procedure ( Urban et al . , 2010 ) . Owing to a higher specimen contrast than in vitreous ice , actin ﬁlaments in the stained preparations were visu - alized with particular clarity , such that they could be manually tracked in three dimensions along most of their length . For the ﬁrst time , mapping of the entire actin network architecture in a cytoplasmic compartment became feasible . However , since man - ual tracking is potentially prone to errors or bias , it was necessary to develop an automatic tracking protocol to complement the manual analysis . The problem of automatically extracting curvilinear structures from images has previously received much attention . A ﬁrst group of algorithms uses mainly local information for their tracking , such as open active contour models ( Li et al . , 2009 ) , fast marching ( Sethian , 1999 ) , and exploiting differential geometry properties ( Steger , 1998 ) . Another class of approaches relies on ﬁltering images with the help of Gauss kernels as a preprocessing step ( Sargin et al . , 2007 ) . This procedure requires selection of the right ﬁlter scale for gradient analysis . Although the diameter of an actin ﬁlament is known , an appropriate Gauss kernel does not seem to exist . Either the ﬁlter mask is too small , such that the single mono - mers obscure the axis , or it is too large and individual ﬁlaments meld with one another or the background clutter . An alternative preprocessing procedure could be image segmentation ( Volkmann , 2002 ) , which as yet has not been combined with ﬁlament tracking . Anisotropic diffusion ( Weickert , 1998 ) is not readily useable in an environment with particles of other material having the same or even higher levels of intensity , but in combination with tube enhancing ﬁltering ( Jiang et al . , 2006 ) has been shown to work well for the detection of microtubules . Whether this approach is also suitable to track the much thinner actin ﬁlaments has yet to be established . An interesting approach avoiding background problems uses template matching ( Mayerich and Keyser , 2009 ; Rigort et al . , 1047 - 8477 / $ - see front matter (cid:2) 2012 Elsevier Inc .

However , in the high - resolution images of negatively stained actin networks cross - sectional proﬁles of ﬁlaments and branch sites are too variable for the purpose of template matching . The Radon transform ( Radon , 1917 ; Gelfand et al . , 1966 ) , has been used in digital image processing for the detection of lines already for many years ( Duda and Hart , 1972 ) . Very recently Sandberg and Brega ( 2007 ) developed a segmentation protocol for thin structures , based on a Radon transform approach . We indepen - dently adapted the Radon transform approach for the special case of negatively stained preparations ( Urban et al . , 2010 ) which fea - ture markedly different ﬁlament proﬁles , contrast and background conditions as compared to cryo - EM tomograms . 2 . Methods In the present study we use a localized version of the Radon transform to determine the local direction of ﬁlaments . The meth - od is implemented in three steps as follows : ( 1 ) selection of start - ing points ; ( 2 ) ﬁlament tracking ; ( 3 ) ﬁlament end determination . The parameters used in the algorithm are listed in Table 1 and details of the algorithm are given in the Appendix . 2 . 1 . The Mean Localized Radon Transform The essence of this tracking method is the identiﬁcation of points that lie on a ﬁlament axis . Mathematically speaking we call such an average gray value of a line segment of length L , starting at Table 1 List of parameters .

Starting point selection A crucial ingredient for the algorithm is the creation of a grid of starting points with a mesh size h , chosen with the intention that each ﬁlament contains at least one grid point . A grid point p s is accepted as a starting point for tracking a ﬁlament if the maximal MLRT of line segments of length L s and centered at p s is above a threshold I s ( Fig . 1 ) . Tracking from all starting points is then initi - ated in both directions d s and (cid:2) d s . In contrast to Sandberg and Brega ( 2007 ) , the criteria for choosing a starting point are not based on analysis of all voxels of the image , which signiﬁcantly reduces the computational cost . The starting point selection algorithm is fully parallelizable . 2 . 3 . Tracking ﬁlaments The essence of one tracking step is to ﬁnd the optimal direction d j þ 1 from a point p j on the ﬁlament towards the next point p j þ 1 on that ﬁlament ( Fig . 2 ) , given an approximation d j of the direction of the ﬁlament at p j , using the parameters deﬁned in Table 1 . For this purpose we compute the MLRT with p j , a ﬁxed length L track and a set of directions ( Fig . 2a ) . We constrain the search to directions that differ from d j by at most an angle d and determine the direction d j þ 1 with the biggest MLRT ( Fig . 2b ) . We complete one tracking iteration by making a step of length l in direction d j þ 1 to point p j þ 1 ( Fig . 2c ) . We refer to this as a forward search , since gray values lying ahead on the tracked ﬁlament are used . We continue to re - peat this step until a boundary is reached or the MLRT along the optimal direction is below a threshold I track . The tracking is re - sumed if , after a small gap of length L gap , the ﬁlament continues . To prevent different starting points initiating the tracking of the same ﬁlament , seed points that lie closer than (cid:2) to a tracked ﬁlament are removed . Because of this procedure , the tracking algorithm cannot be parallelized . 2 . 4 . Determination of ﬁlament ends If the tracking has stopped at a point p j close to a ﬁlament end , the forward search for the optimal direction is not useful any more . Inevitably the line segments overshoot the end of the tracked ﬁla - ment and other material codetermines the tracking direction . To avoid the loss of the last part of the ﬁlament a Janus - faced version of the algorithm is used in this situation . As a ﬁrst step , the approx - imative direction d j at p j is improved by looking backwards along the ﬁlament instead of forwards ( Fig . 3a ) . Then the iteration is re - started , but now we only look forward as far as one iteration step l , with the remaining length L track (cid:2) l of the control segment extend - ing backwards ( Fig . 3b ) . When , during this new iteration , the MLRT Fig . 5 .

Detail of Fig . 5 showing a close match of automatically and manually tracked ﬁlaments . The manually tracked ﬁlaments are depicted in blue , the automatically tracked ones in red ( the model is tilted to illustrate the overlap ) . Table 3 The number of starting points is determined by the parameters I s for the minimal intensity and L s for the integration length . High values in both parameters lead to the detection of few starting points on rather stiff and prominent ﬁlaments , whereas small values result in many seed points , increasing the possibility of false positives . Taking a long L s and a medium I s ensures the detection of starting points on ﬁlaments and excludes noise with locally high intensity .

Choice of parameters Optimal results depend on an appropriate choice of parameters . The differences between lamellipodial pictures in magniﬁcation , contrast , and staining require some tuning of the parameters ( Ta - ble 1 ) by hand . The use of the localized Radon transform relies on the assump - tion that the ﬁlaments are not strongly bent ; more precisely : their diameter d ( approximately 7 nm for actin ﬁlaments ) has to be small enough compared to their typical curvature radius . From in vitro experiments , minimal curvature radii of actin ﬁlaments between 150 and 200 nm have been reported ( Arai et al . , 1999 ; Taylor et al . , 2000 ) . However , to accomodate short distance inho - mogeneities in ﬁlament trajectories we allowed a local curvature radius r min ¼ 50 nm . During tracking , a diversion to ﬁlaments branching off the one being tracked must be avoided . The maximal angle d ¼ p = 36 between adjacent pieces of tracked ﬁlaments corre - sponds to 5 degrees . With the typical values for r min and d stated above , this gives l (cid:3) 4 : 4 nm for the stepsize of the tracking itera - tion ( see Appendix E ) . The maximal length L of a line segment contained in a thin cir - cular tube with diameter d and curvature radius r is L (cid:3) 2 ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2 rd p . The value L (cid:3) 53 nm , computed with r ¼ r min ¼ 50 nm and with the diameter of an actin ﬁlament is , in practice , a reasonable choice for the lengths L track and L s of the line segments in the localized Radon transform . The maximal length L gap of a low intensity gap , which can be bridged , is smaller than L track ( see below ) . The choice of the mesh size h of the grid for starting points is a trade off between computational cost and accuracy . We typically choose several nm . To avoid multiple identiﬁcation of the same ﬁl - ament , starting points lying closer than a distance e from a tracked ﬁlament , corresponding to the diameter of an actin ﬁlament , are excluded . The intensities I track and I s are chosen according to the bright - ness and contrast of the tomogram . For the starting point selection we use values of L s and I s a little larger than L track and I track , in order to reduce the identiﬁcation of false positives . 3 . Results and discussion The method is applied here to two electron tomograms of lamellipodia in different stages of movement . The ﬁrst example is a tomogram of a part of the lamellipodium of a moving mouse embryo ﬁbroblast ( Fig . 4 ) . Most of the ﬁlaments have been tracked manually ( Vinzenz et al . , 2012 ) , which gives us the opportunity for a direct comparison . The edge length of a cubic voxel 0 . 746 nm was used as an internal reference length in the implementation , leading to non integer values for the length parameters . The image intensity is scaled to the interval [ 0 , 1 ] , with 0 representing black , 1 encoding white and ﬁlaments are brighter than the background . The parameter values listed in Table 2 have been used . Fig . 7 . Examples of typical , irregular features of the raw data shown in subsequent tomogram sections , with the feature centered .

Winkler et al . / Journal of Structural Biology 178 ( 2012 ) 19 – 28 Fig . 5 ( Supplementary video 1 ) shows a projection of the 3D tracking results ( a ) and the layers of the tomogram combined in z ( b ) . Automatically and manually tracked ﬁlaments are repre - sented as cylinders with a constant circular cross section . A detail of the tracked tomogram in Fig . 5 is shown in Fig . 6 and reveals a close correspondence between the manually tracked ﬁlaments ( blue ) and the automatically tracked ﬁlaments ( red ) . It was possi - ble to track individual ﬁlaments over lengths exceeding 1 l m . The effects of parameters on the number of starting points is indicated in Table 3 . The grid spacing h of the search grid has not been varied , since it is typically chosen very ﬁne , such that the detection of all ﬁlaments is guaranteed . Irregularities in ﬁlament contours and non - ﬁlamentous background material ( Fig . 7 ) are typical hurdles in ﬁlament tracking . However , as shown in Fig . 8 the method deals with these quite successfully . Local curvatures along the automat - ically tracked ﬁlaments have been computed ( see Appendix E ) . The median and mimimal curvature radii are r median ¼ 410 nm and r minimal ¼ 196 nm . The latter is in the range of minimal curvatures of actin ﬁlaments reported in the literature and well above the threshold value used in the tracking , which shows that our choice of parameters is not too restrictive . From the tracked ﬁlament contours the total ﬁlament length in a tomogram as well as the distribution of ﬁlament orientations are readily computed . The total ﬁlament length in the projected area indicated in Fig . 5 was estimated as 14 . 2 l m by manual tracking and 15 . 8 l m by automatic tracking . Correlation of both tracking sets with the raw data indicated that the difference was mainly due to incomplete manual tracking . Computation of the mean angles of the two - dimensional projections of the ﬁlaments ( Fig . 9 ) shows the expected bimodal distribution for a moving cell ( Koestler et al . , 2008 ) . The distance of the peaks of approximately seventy degrees corresponds to the branching angle of actin ﬁlaments . As shown in Fig . 9 the angu - lar distributions are essentially insensitive to the chosen value of I track . The effects of changing tracking parameters using the raw data from Fig . 5 are illustrated in Fig . 10 . The paramters chosen by correlation with manual tracking are shown on the left of the ﬁgure and the effects of varying these parameters on the right . The variations of the stepsize l ( a – c ) , the length of the line seg - ments L track ( d – f ) , the maximal angle deviation d ( g – i ) and the max - imal length of gaps L gap ( m – o ) have little effect on the outcome , whereas deviations in the intensity threshold I track ( j – l ) and the exclusion radius (cid:2) ( p – r ) signiﬁcantly change the result . An example of ﬁlament tracking in the lamelliopodium of a 3T3 ﬁbroblast spreading on polylysine ( Urban et al . , 2010 ) is shown in Fig . 11 . For this tomogram the parameter values listed in Table 4 were chosen . The automatically tracked ﬁlaments are shown in Fig . 11a and the angular distribution in Fig . 12 . The total ﬁlament length in the highlighted area is 30 . 3 l m and the ﬁlament length density is 342 l m (cid:2) 1 . The angle distribution indicates that the cell was not organized for persistent protrusion ( Fig . 12 ; Koestler et al . , 2008 ) . Tracked ﬁlaments superimposed onto the original data are de - picted in Fig . 13 ( Supplementary video 2 ) , which shows sequential 2D sections of a detail . 4 . Conclusions An approach has been introduced for automatic identiﬁcation and tracking of actin ﬁlamentsin three - dimensional EM tomograms Fig . 8 .

Only selected tracks are shown ingreen to demonstrate : ( a – d ) no false positives inside the clutter ; ( e – h ) both ﬁlaments forming the branch are identiﬁed ; ( i – l ) both closely overlapping ﬁlaments are tracked correctly ; ( m – p ) a low intensity gap is bridged .

The method combines a system - atic search for starting points and a tracking iteration based on a choice of the continuation direction by a localized Radon transform , which eliminates problems with different types of imperfections and noise . Apart from three - dimensional visualisations , the results enable the computation of statistical properties of the meshwork such as anglular distributions and total ﬁlament length . Future work will concentrate on extending the systematic approach for determining suitable parameter values , possibly including adaptive thresholds for the ﬁlament intensity levels based on the brightness and contrast . This should speed up the whole process signiﬁcantly . In addition , the tracking protocol should be further developed to automatically identify branch junctions in the network ( Vinzenz et al . , 2012 ) . Efforts in this direction , including analysis also of cryo - electron tomograms of cytoskeletons are underway . An ambitious project is the combination of the tracking results with mathematical models for the nucleation , polymerization , and depolymerization dynamics as well as the mechanics of the net - work . This will require the identiﬁcation of branches ( Small et al . , 2011 ) , the computation of forces between ﬁlaments ( e . g . , caused by cross links ) , and of forces between ﬁlaments and the cell membrane by solving mathematical inverse problems for bending ﬁlaments . In particular , for a continuum modeling approach ( Oelz et al . , 2008 ; Oelz and Schmeiser , 2009 ) the computation of statis - tical properties in localized regions will be important . 5 . Technical aspects The introduced automatic tracking protocol for actin ﬁlaments was implemented in MATLAB , commercially distributed by The MathWorks , Inc . The determination of the starting points for NIH 3T3 ﬁbroblast takes (cid:4) 20 min on a conventional dual core notebook with 6 GB RAM , parallelized to 3 workers , while the serial tracking of the ﬁlaments then takes (cid:4) 1 . 5 min . The visualizations were pro - duced with the help of MATLAB , IMod ( Kremer et al . , 1996 ) , Para - view by Kitware Inc . and InkScape .

Choice of parameters A reasonable choice for the search length L can be computed as the length of the longest straight line inside a ﬁlament of curvature radius r and diameter d ( Fig . 14 ) : L ¼ 2 ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2 rd p : Estimates for the local curvature radius can be computed as the ra - dius of circumference of the triangle built by consecutive points p j (cid:2) 1 ; p j ; p j þ 1 on a tracked ﬁlament .

As a regulariza - tion we do not take consecutive points , but a triple of points with a distance along the ﬁlament of 36 nm , which is on the other hand small enough compared to typical values of the curvature radius . Since the distances between manually tracked points can be signif - icantly larger , the computation of local curvature is only feasible for the highly resolved automatically tracked ﬁlaments .
