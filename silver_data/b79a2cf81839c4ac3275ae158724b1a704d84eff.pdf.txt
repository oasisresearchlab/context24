Unlike clathrin - mediated en - docytosis , which exploits cargo - speciﬁc adaptors for selective protein internalization , the clathrin and dynamin - independent endocytic pathway ( CLIC - GEEC , CG - pathway ) has until now been considered a bulk internalization route for the ﬂuid phase , glycosylated membrane proteins and lipids 2 , 3 . Although the core molecular players of CG endocytosis have been recently deﬁned , no cargo - speciﬁc adaptors are known and evidence of selective protein uptake into the pathway is lacking 3 . Here , we identify the ﬁrst cargo - speciﬁc adaptor for CG - endocytosis and demonstrate its clinical relevance in breast cancer progres - sion . By combining unbiased molecular characterization and super - resolution imaging , we identiﬁed the actin - binding pro - tein swiprosin - 1 ( EFHD2 ) as a cargo - speciﬁc adaptor regulat - ing integrin internalization via the CG - pathway . Swiprosin - 1 couples active Rab21 - associated integrins with key components of the CG - endocytic machinery , IRSp53 and actin . Swiprosin - 1 is critical for integrin endocytosis , but not for other CG - cargo and supports integrin - dependent cancer cell migration and in - vasion , with clinically relevant implications for breast cancer . Our results demonstrate a previously unknown cargo selectivity for the CG - pathway and opens the possibility to discover more adaptors regulating it .

The predominant view is that endocytosis speciﬁcity is achieved through cargo - speciﬁc adaptors , as described in detail for the best char - acterized internalization route clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) 2 , 4 . This raises the possibility of yet unknown cargo adaptor proteins functioning as key gatekeepers for other en - dosomal routes . The CG - pathway internalizes a major frac - tion of the extracellular ﬂuid phase , glycosylphosphotidyli - nositol ( GPI ) - anchored proteins and other cell surface recep - tors including nutrient transporters , ion channels and cell ad - hesion receptors 5 , 6 as well as pathogens such as bacteria and viruses 5 , 7 . This non - specialized internalization of a variety of cargo occurs through high capacity tubulovesicular mem - brane uptake carriers called CLICs ( clathrin - independent car - riers ) 8 , 9 . CLICs are formed via the recruitment of Arf1 , actin - binding BAR - domain protein IRSp53 and Arp2 / 3 to the membrane , followed by Cdc42 activation of IRSp53 and Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization , presumptively result - ing in the scission of CLICs and generation of CG endosomes 10 . Although the core molecular players of CG endocyto - sis have been recently deﬁned , no cargo - speciﬁc adaptors are known 3 . The small GTPase Rab21 is unique in its ability to bind directly to integrin receptors to regulate endo / exosomal trafﬁc , cytokinesis , chromosome integrity , endosomal signal - ing and anoikis 11 - 14 . Rab21 interacts with integrins indepen - dently of its activation status ( GDP / GTP ) ; nevertheless , inte - grin endocytosis requires Rab21 activity 11 through currently unknown mechanisms . In addition , very few Rab21 inter - actors have been identiﬁed 15 . Here , we identify swiprosin - 1 ( EFHD2 ) as a novel interactor of Rab21 and as the ﬁrst cargo - speciﬁc adaptor for CG - endocytosis and demonstrate its clinical relevance as a prognostic marker for metastatic breast cancer . Results We performed proteomic analyses by stable isotope la - belling with amino acids in cell culture ( SILAC ) of Rab21 wild - type ( WT ) , Rab21Q76L active mutant ( CA - Rab21 ) or Rab21T31N inactive mutant ( DN - Rab21 ) expressing cells to identify Rab21 - interacting proteins 16 , 17 . This mass spec - Moreno - Layseca et al . | 1 – 15 trometry ( MS ) strategy identiﬁed the actin binding protein swiprosin - 1 ( EFHD2 ) as a putative active Rab21 interac - tor ( Fig . 1A , Extended Data Fig . 1 , Supplementary Table 1 ) . Validation experiments with GFP pulldowns from cell lysate demonstrated endogenous swiprosin - 1 binding prefer - ably to WT and CA - Rab21 , and not to the closely related Rab5 GTPase ( Fig . 1B , Extended Data Fig . 2 ) . In ad - dition , puriﬁed recombinant GST - swiprosin - 1 interacted di - rectly with GTP - analog loaded recombinant Rab21 ( Fig . 1C ) . The known Rab21 - GTP speciﬁc interactor APPL1 8 , 19 was included as a positive control . The interaction was fur - ther validated in cells . The proximity ligation assay ( PLA ) indicated endogenous swiprosin - 1 and Rab21 interaction in intact cells ( Fig . 1D ) , and bimolecular ﬂuorescence comple - mentation ( BiFC ) 20 revealed swiprosin - 1 and Rab21 inter - action at the cell - ECM interface ( TIRF plane ) in live cells ( Fig . 1E , Extended Data Fig . 3A ) . The V1 - Rab21 / V2 - swiprosin - 1 BiFC interaction puncta were dynamic , detected at the cell periphery and in the cell center , and a similar signal was absent in Venus - expressing control cells ( Supple - mentary Video 1 ) . Together , these data identify swiprosin - 1 as a novel active Rab21 interactor . Super - resolution struc - tured illumination microscopy ( SIM ) images of the cell - ECM interface revealed overlap between swiprosin - 1 , Rab21 and β 1 - integrin in structures extending vertically into the cell ( Fig . 1F - G , x - z projections ) . Swiprosin - 1 co - localized sig - niﬁcantly more with Rab21 than Rab5 , Rab7 and Rab11 ( Extended Data Fig . 2B ) , indicating a degree of speci - ﬁcity for Rab21 binding . Interestingly , Arf1 was detected as an active Rab21 interactor alongside swiprosin - 1 ( Fig . 1A , Extended Data Fig . 1 ) prompting us to test whether Rab21 and / or swiprosin - 1 would associate with Arf1 . Arf1 is a known regulator of CG - endocytosis ( Fig . 1H ) , where cargo uptake is mediated by tubulovesicular membrane in - vaginations 21 . Both GFP - Rab21 and GFP - swiprosin - 1 co - immunoprecipitated endogenous Arf1 ( Fig . 1I ) . In addition , another CG - endocytosis regulator , IRSp53 10 , was also de - tected in the co - immunoprecipitations ( Fig . 1I ) . This indi - cates that the Rab21 - swiprosin - 1 complex is associated with the CG - endocytosis machinery . To investigate this more in detail , we imaged swiprosin - 1 co - localization with known components of CME , caveolin - mediated endocytosis and CG - endocytosis using SIM . We observed swiprosin - 1 co - localizing signiﬁcantly more with Rab21 , Arf1 and IRSp53 than clathrin , the clathrin adaptor AP2 , caveolin or dynamin2 ( Fig . 1J - K ) . These data are consistent with Rab21 - mediated integrin endocytosis remaining unaffected by clathrin inhibi - tion 22 , the components of the clathrin and caveolin endocytic pathways not being enriched in the active Rab21 fractions an - alyzed by mass spectrometry ( Fig . 1A , Extended Data Fig . 1 ) and the absence of dynamin I / II in bimolecular complemen - tation afﬁnity puriﬁed ( BiCAP ) 20 V1 - Rab21 and V2 - Swip1 complexes in cells ( Fig . 1L ; Extended Data Fig . 3B ) . Fur - thermore , Arf1 localization to swiprosin - 1 - positive structures was visible using another super - resolution microscopy tech - nique : the localization - based method DNA - PAINT 23 ( Ex - tended Data Fig . 4 ) and Rab21 / swiprosin - 1 - BiFC puncta were detected dynamically moving towards IRSp53 - positive structures before disappearing from the TIRF plane in live cells ( Fig . 1M , Supplementary Video 2 ) . These data indi - cate the existence of a swiprosin - 1 / Rab21 - GTP complex that links to the CG - endocytosis machinery . CG - endocytosis is the major route for the up - take / internalization of versatile cargo : ﬂuid phase endo - cytosis , the major histocompatibility complex I ( MHCI ) and cell surface receptors including integrins 6 ; whereas Rab21 has been primarily linked to integrin internalization 11 , raising the possibility that the swiprosin - 1 / Rab21 com - plex could regulate speciﬁcity of integrin entry into the CG pathway . Rab21 - integrin interaction requires the con - served KR - residues within the integrin α - subunit cytoplas - mic tail 11 Mutation of these residues ( KR1160 / 61AA ) in the integrin α 2 - subunit 11 , 14 signiﬁcantly reduced integrin co - localization with swiprosin - 1 - positive structures ( Fig . 2A ) , indicating that a preserved integrin - Rab21 interaction is re - quired for swiprosin - 1 recruitment of the integrin receptor . We next investigated the requirement for swiprosin - 1 in CG - endocytosis of integrins . Silencing of swiprosin - 1 decreased , and overexpression of GFP - swiprosin - 1 increased , the up - take of cell - surface labelled β 1 - integrin ( antibody recognizes the active conformation of the receptor ) in MDA - MB - 231 cells . The effect on integrin endocytosis was apparent as early as the 5 - minute time point and persisted for up to 30 minutes ( Fig . 2B , Extended Data Fig . 5A ) . The expression of ectopic GFP - swiprosin - 1 rescued β 1 - integrin endocytosis in swiprosin - 1 - silenced cells and increased the uptake in con - trol siRNA transfected cells ( Fig . 2C ) . Moreover , silencing of Arf1 or IRSp53 , both essential members of the CG pathway , with two independent siRNAs , signiﬁcantly decreased β 1 - integrin endocytosis in MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Extended Data Fig . 5B ) . Furthermore , integrin endocytosis was impaired in IRSp53 - null mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts ( IRSp53 / MEF ; Extended Data Fig . 5C ) . This was speciﬁcally due to re - duced integrin uptake and not due to lower integrin levels , since total integrin levels were unaffected by loss of IRSp53 or swiprosin - 1 ( Extended Data Fig . 5C - D ) . Swiprosin - 1 - induced integrin endocytosis was dependent on the CG path - way machinery , since depletion of IRSp53 abolished the abil - ity of GFP - swiprosin - 1 overexpression to induce β 1 - integrin endocytosis ( Fig . 2D ) . In addition , the initial uptake of in - tegrins overlapped with other CG cargos . Immediately after endocytosis ( 2 and 5 minutes ) , plasma membrane labelled β 1 - integrin co - localized with 10 kDa dextran , a ﬂuid phase cargo for the CG pathway , as efﬁciently as the co - localization of dextran labelled with two different dyes ( Fig . 2E ) . Taken together , these data indicate that swiprosin - 1 induces integrin endocytosis via the CG pathway in these cells . Next , we investigated whether swiprosin - 1 regulates the endocytosis of other CG cargos . Swiprosin - 1 silencing had no effect on the uptake of 10 kDa dextran or MHCI ( Fig . 2F - G ) . In contrast , silencing of IRSp53 signiﬁcantly impaired endocytosis of both cargos ( Fig . 2F ) , validating the approach . In addition , swiprosin - 1 depletion did not affect the endo - cytosis of transferrin or EGFR ( Extended Data Fig . 5E - F ) , 2 Moreno - Layseca et al . | H −2 −1 0 1 2 −2 −1 0 1 2 log 10 GFP−CA−Rab21 vs .

Taken together these data im - ply that swiprosin - 1 speciﬁcally controls integrin cargo re - cruitment towards CG - endocytosis rather than affecting the overall activity of this pathway . These data explain the long - standing conundrum of the requirement for active Rab21 in integrin endocytosis 11 . Even though Rab21 binds integrins in GDP and GTP - bound states , swiprosin - 1 interacts specif - ically with Rab21 - GTP , coupling active Rab21 and integrin cargo to CG - endocytosis . A common emerging theme among non - clathrin endocytosis is a reliance on the actin cytoskele - ton 26 . Intrigued by the established actin - binding activity of swiprosin - 1 27 , we investigated whether this function was im - portant for swiprosin - 1 - mediated integrin CG - endocytosis . Deleting the ﬁrst EF - hand domain ( EF1 ) of swiprosin - 1 , ren - dered swiprosin - 1 unable to bind actin , concordant with a previous report 27 , and abolished its ability to induce inte - grin endocytosis ( Fig . 3A - C ) . In contrast , EF2 deletion had no signiﬁcant effect on swiprosin - 1 - induced integrin uptake . This indicates that swiprosin - 1 binding to actin is necessary for its ability to augment integrin endocytosis . SIM imag - ing revealed F - actin overlap with swiprosin - 1 and β 1 - integrin close to the cell - ECM interface ( Fig . 3D ) , indicating that swiprosin - 1 and the actin cytoskeleton are in close proxim - ity during integrin endocytosis . In addition to swiprosin - 1 localization at cell - ECM proximal structures , we observed swiprosin - 1 deeper inside the cell , where it overlapped with Rab21 - positive endosome - like vesicles ( Fig . 3E ) and F - actin in discrete puncta around Rab21 vesicles ( Fig . 3E yellow arrows , Supplementary Video 3 ) . Similar localization was visualized using GBP - APEX ( GFP - binding protein soybean ascorbate peroxidase ) labelled GFP - swiprosin - 1 imaged with electron microscopy ( Fig . 3F ) 28 . Swiprosin - 1 localized to ﬁlaments close to the plasma membrane and in vicinity of endosomes ( Fig . 3E pink arrow and 3F blue arrows ) . Swiprosin - 1 localization with actin on Rab21 endosomes led us to investigate whether swiprosin - 1 regulates endosome movement . Silencing of swiprosin - 1 signiﬁcantly reduced the speed of GFP - Rab21 vesicle movement and restricted their subcellular distribution to the cell periphery ( Fig . 3G , Supplementary Videos 4 - 5 ) . The motility of Rab21 vesicles was actin dependent , since the actin inhibitor cytochalasin D reduced vesicle speed ( Fig . 3H ) , consistent with previous observations 11 . Taken together , these data highlight a role for actin in both swiprosin - 1 / Rab21 - dependent integrin CG - endocytosis and Rab21 - mediated integrin endosomal trafﬁc within the cell ( Fig . 3I ) . Integrin endocytosis and intracellular transport are crucial for integrin turnover , cell migration and invasion 15 , 29 . Concordant with this notion we found that vinculin - containing focal adhesions accumulated in swiprosin - 1 - silenced cells on collagen I , ﬁbronectin and laminin - 1 - coated surfaces ( Fig . 4A ) . This phenotype was also present in cells silenced for Arf1 or IRSp53 ( Extended Data Fig . 6 ) indicat - ing that integrin endocytosis through the CG pathway may function to regulate adhesion dynamics and cell motility . Us - ing live - cell imaging of paxillin - positive focal adhesions , we observed signiﬁcantly slower adhesion assembly and disas - sembly rates in swiprosin - 1 - silenced cells compared to con - trol cells ( Fig . 4B ) . This correlated with signiﬁcantly im - paired cell migration in a 2D scratch wound assay ( Fig . 4C ) , in line with previously reported migration defects of IRSp53 - null ﬁbroblasts 30 , and defective cell invasion through a 3D collagen matrix ( Fig . 4D ) . These data indicate that swiprosin - 1 stimulates integrin adhesion dynamics and the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells . This may have clini - cally relevant implications in breast cancer . qPCR analyses of swiprosin - 1 mRNA levels from 192 breast cancer speci - mens revealed that swiprosin - 1 expression was signiﬁcantly higher in the highest grade tumors and the most metastatic breast cancer subtypes : HER2 - positive and triple negative ( TNBC ) ( Extended Data Fig . 7 ) . These ﬁndings were further validated with immunohistochemistry of HER2 + and TNBC tissue microarrays using a swiprosin - 1 speciﬁc antibody ( Ex - tended Data Fig . 8A ) . Swiprosin - 1 was highly expressed in a high proportion of both breast tumour subtypes ( 65 - 75 % ) , and in the case of TNBC , high swiprosin - 1 staining in our cohort was associated with poor clinical outcome ( Fig . 4E ) . We also analysed the prognostic value of high membranal signal for swiprosin - 1 and found a more pronounced corre - lation with poor clinical outcome ( Extended Data Fig . 8B - D ) . Moreover , we observed that the TNBC patients with high membranal swiprosin - 1 had signiﬁcantly more lymph node metastasis than that of medium - low membranal swiprosin - 1 4 Moreno - Layseca et al . | 3 µm A C G B D F E Internalized dextran Internalized β1 - integrin 0 200 400 600 1 000 1 500 N o r m a li z ed i n t en s i t y ( A U ) * * * * * * * * ns ns S w i p1 s i R N A # 2 S w i p1 s i R N A # 1 s i C T R L I R S p53 s i R N A # 2 s i C T R L I R S p53 s i R N A # 1 0 1 00 200 3 00 400400600 S w i p1 s i R N A # 2 s i C T R L * * * * * * * * * * * * * * s i C T R L S w i p1 s i R N A # 1 I R S p53 s i R N A # 2 I R S p53 s i R N A # 1 N o r m a li z ed i n t en s i t y ( A U ) s i C T R L I R S p53 s i RN A # 1 I R S p53 s i RN A # 2 s i C T R L S w i p1 s i RN A # 1 10 µm 10 µm MHCI MHCI MHCI 0 20 40 60 80 Time ( min ) Dextran - FITC β1 - integrin - AF488 % c o l o c a li z ed s po t s 5 min internalization Dextran - TMR β 1 - integrin - AF488 10 µm Colocalization with Dextran - TMR MHCI 0 1 00 200 3 00 400 500 N o r m a li z ed i n t en s i t y ( A U ) ns * * * * 10 µm 10 µm 10 µm 10 µm 10 µm 10 µm 10 µm 10 µm 10 µm 10 µm 10 µm 10 µm 2 5 Time ( min ) Internalized β1 - integrin N o r m a li z ed i n t en s i t y ( A U ) I n t e r na li z a t i on - 15 m i n siCTRL Swip1 siRNA # 1 Swip1 Calnexin s i C T R L S w i p1 s i R N A # 1 30 µm 30 µm 0 50 1 00 1 50 200200 3 00 0 5 15 30 Swip1siRNA # 1 siCTRL * * * * * * * * * * * * β1 - integrin β1 - integrin GFP - α2integrin - AA mScarlet - I - Swip1 GFP α2 - integrin - WT mScarlet - I - Swip1 0 . 5 µm x z 0 . 5 µm x z * * * * Colocalization with mScarlet - I - Swip1 W T AA % c o l o c a li z ed s po t s 60 20 40 0 80 GFP - α2 integrin - AA GFP - α2 integrin - WT KR1160 / 61AA WKLGFF AA KYEKMTKNPDEIDETTELSS WKLGFFKRKYEKMTKNPDEIDETTELSS Rab21 binding motif GFP - α2 integrin 37 - 50 - 25 - kDa 100 - Endogenous Swip1 GFP - Swip1 GFP Calnexin G F P G F P G F P - S w i p1 G F P - S w i p1 s i C T R L + G F P s i S w i p1 + G F P s i S w i p1 + G F P - S w i p1 s i C T R L + G F P - S w i p1 400 200 300 100 0 15003000 Internalized β1 - integrin N o r m a li z ed i n t en s i t y ( A U ) * * * * * * * siSwip1 siCTRL s i C T R L + G F P s i I R S p 53 + G F P s i I R S p53 + G F P - S w i p1 s i C T R L + G F P - S w i p1 Internalized β1 - integrin N o r m a li z ed i n t en s i t y ( A U ) 400 200 300 100 0 15003000 Calnexin IRSp53 50 - GFP 100 - 37 - 50 - 25 - G F P G F P G F P - I R S p53 G F P - I R S p53 * * * * * * * * * * ns siSwip1 siCTRL kDa S w i p1 s i R N A # 1 s i C T R L I R S p53 s i R N A # 1 10 µm S w i p1 s i RN A # 2 β1 - integrin β1 - integrin Dextran Dextran β1 - integrin β1 - integrin Dextran Dextran β1 - integrin β1 - integrin Dextran Dextran s i C T R L S w i p1 s i RN A # 1 I R S p53 s i RN A # 1 Internalization at 15 min Internalization at 15 min 100 ns ns Fig . 2 .

Accord - ing to the Cox proportional hazards model , high swiprosin - 1 membranal staining was associated with poor prognosis af - ter adjustment with Ki67 , tumor size , lymph node metasta - sis status , or grade ( Extended Data Fig . 8 ) . These data , demonstrating that elevated swiprosin - 1 levels strongly and independently correlate with breast cancer metastasis and re - duced survival , advocate swiprosin - 1 as an original , indepen - dent prognostic marker and a potential drug target . Discussion . Swiprosin - 1 has not been previously associ - ated with endocytosis and evidence for speciﬁc cargo adap - tors or selective uptake in the CG - endocytosis pathway has been lacking . Our ﬁndings place swiprosin - 1 as the ﬁrst vali - dated cargo - speciﬁc adaptor for the CG pathway . Swiprosin - 1 directs active Rab21 and β 1 - integrins to the CG pathway and is necessary for active integrin endocytosis through this route , while fully dispensable for the uptake of other CG car - gos . This demonstrates an important and unexpected feature of this pathway : cargo - speciﬁc adaptor - based recruitment of receptors . It also highlights the possibility of unprecedented cargo selectivity functions for the CG pathway in a man - ner similar to that described for numerous other endocytosed proteins following different endocytosis routes . Moreover , our ﬁndings explain the previously reported link between the CG pathway components , IRSp53 and Arf1 , and adhesion phenotypes : IRSp53 contributes to cell migration and inva - sion through multiple mechanisms , including ﬁlopodia gen - eration 31 , 32 , and curvature sensing with WAVE at the neck of membrane invaginations 33 . Arf1 depletion results in defec - tive adhesion and migration in MDA - MB - 231 cells 34 - 36 , and our ﬁnding of Arf1 involvement in integrin endocytosis sheds light on the mechanism behind these observations . Interest - ingly , knockout of swiprosin in Drosophila results in a mild adhesion defect similar to the deletion of Rho - GAP - domain - containing protein GRAF1 , another regulator of CLIC for - mation , suggesting an in vivo relevant role for swiprosin - 1 in regulating cell - ECM interactions 37 , 38 . Our data explains why Rab21 activation is required for integrin endocytosis and deﬁnes the thus far unknown Rab21 - regulated endocytosis route . How Rab21 is activated , possibly by integrin - mediated adhesion , is an area that requires further investigation . Re - cently , a proximity - biotinylation screen revealed that Rab21 regulates sorting of a subset of clathrin - independent cargos 39 . However , the involvement of swiprosin - 1 in later en - dosomal sorting or retromer - mediated recycling 39 remains to be investigated . Here , we showed that swiprosin - 1 acts as a cargo adaptor bridging the CG endocytic machinery to Rab21 - bound integrin cargo , and couples Rab21 endo - somes , and their motility in cells , to the actin cytoskeleton . This dual functionality of swiprosin - 1 regulates cell adhe - sion turnover , migration and invasion . Perhaps unsurpris - ingly , given the importance of these events in cancer progres - sion , swiprosin - 1 expression has clinically relevant implica - tions for TNBC . Thus , swiprosin - 1 and the mechanism of its interaction with Rab21 offer potentially exciting therapeutic targets for metastatic breast cancer . Data availability .

MDA - MB - 231 ( triple negative human breast adenocarcinoma ) cells were grown in Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( FCS ) and 1 % L - glutamine . Cells were purchased from the Amer - ican Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) and were routinely monitored for mycoplasma contamination . Mouse embry - onic ﬁbroblasts ( MEFs ) were cultured in DMEM supple - mented with 20 % FCS , 1 % L - glutamine and 1 µg / ml puromycin . Human embryonic kidney 293 ( HEK293 ) cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 20 % FCS and 1 % L - glutamine . Plasmids of interest were trans - fected using Lipofectamine 3000 ( Thermo Fisher Scien - tiﬁc ) or jetPRIME® ( Polyplus transfection ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The expression of proteins of interest was suppressed using 27 nM siRNA and lipo - fectamine siRNA Max ( ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc ) according to manufacturer’s instructions . The siRNA used as con - trol ( siCTRL ) was Allstars negative control siRNA ( Qia - gen , Cat . No . 1027281 ) . The siRNA oligonucleotides tar - geting swiprosin - 1 were purchased from Sigma ( siRNA # 1 Cat . No . SASI _ Hs01 _ 00186848 and siRNA # 2 Cat . No . SASI _ Hs01 _ 00186847 ) .

Cover - slips were coated with either 10 µg / mL of ﬁbronectin ( FC010 Sigma ) , 12 µg / mL of laminin - 1 ( L4544 Sigma ) or 300 µg / mL of collagen I from rat - tail ( 08 - 115 Sigma ) . Plasmids . Human Rab21 ( aa 16 - 225 ) constructs were cloned into a Gateway destination vector pgLAP1 ( Addgene plasmid # 19702 ) to express Rab21 with an N - terminal GFP followed by a TEV cleavage site and an S - Tag in mam - malian cells . As entry vector , we used pCR8 / GW / Topo ( Thermo Fisher , USA ) , in which human Rab21 was cloned by TOPO cloning . The Rab21 mutants Q76L ( active ) and T33N ( inactive ) were introduced into the entry clone by site - directed mutagenesis . Mouse full - length swiprosin - 1 , EF1 - swiprosin - 1 ( deletion in the EF1 domain , aa 96 - 166 ) and EF2 - swiprosin - 1 ( deletion at the EF2 domain , aa 134 - 159 ) were a kind gift from Dr . Dirk Mielenz ( Division of Molecular Immunology , Nikolaus - Fiebiger - Centre , Univer - sity of Erlangen - Nuremberg , Germany ) . The corresponding coding sequences were subcloned into the pEGFP - N1 back - bone vector using the XhoI and EcoRI restriction sites . Full - length swiprosin - 1 was also subcloned by TOPO cloning into the Gateway vector pCR8GWTopo . Then , a LR clonase II reaction was performed to shuttle full - length swiprosin - 1 into pGEX - 4T1 . mScarlet - I swiprosin - 1 was generated from the GFP - tagged construct by introducing the mScarlet - I sequence using the AgeI and MfeI restriction sites . Arf1 - HA and Arf1 - GFP were obtained from Addgene ( plasmids # 79409 and # 49578 ) .

DEST51 - mVenus was obtained from Addgene ( plasmid # 154899 ) . Antibodies . The antibodies used in this work are listed in Supplementary Table 2 . Generation of stable cell lines and SILAC - cell culture treat - ment . To generate stable GFP - Rab21 expressing mam - malian cell lines , a FRT ( Flp Recombination Target ) - entry site was ﬁrst introduced into MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells using the Flp - In technology ( Thermo Fisher , USA ) . Brieﬂy , MDA - MB - 231 cells were transfected with pFRT / lacZeo2 and stable clones were isolated using Zeocin as the selection marker ( 200 µg / ml ) . The resulting MDA - MB - 231 - FRT cell line was then co - transfected with the pgLAP1 - Rab21 plasmid and pOG44 and stable clones were selected in 500 µg / ml Hygromycin - containing medium and tested for GFP - Rab21 expression . Stable MDA - MB - 231 - GFP - Rab21 cell lines were cultivated in heavy ( Arg - 10 / Lys - 8 ) or light SILAC - DMEM medium plus Hygromycin ( 200 µg / ml ) for 12 days to ensure at least 10 replication cycles for efﬁcient labelling . Hygromycin supplementation was omit - ted for the last two days before the co - IP experiment . Screening for Rab21 interaction partners by GFP pulldown . Each mass spectrometry experiment consisted of a mixture of a GFP - pulldown in active GFP - Rab21 expressing MDA - MB - 231 cells ( WT or active Rab21 Q76L mutant ) grown in heavy medium and a GFP - pulldown in control cells ( ex - pressing GFP or inactive GFP - Rab21 T33N mutant ) grown in light medium ( forward experiment ) . In the reverse ex - periment , the heavy and light media were exchanged ( label swap experiment ) . Brieﬂy , co - IP samples were prepared as follows . Cells ( two 15 cm dishes ) were grown until 60 - 80 % conﬂuence , washed with ice cold PBSM ( PBS + 5 mM MgCl 2 ) , harvested in PBSM , pooled and washed again . Cell pellets were resuspended in 600 µl lysis buffer LB ( 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 150 mM KCl , 1 . 3 % n - beta - octyl - D - glucopyranoside , 10 % Glycerol , protease and phosphatase inhibitors and 500 µM GppNHp for GFP - active Rab21 - expressing cells or 500 µM GDP for GFP - inactive Rab21 - expressing cells ) and lysed by douncing 40x in a tis - sue grinder ( dounce homogenizer ) and incubating for 20 min on ice . The insoluble fraction was removed by centrifuga - tion at 18000x g and the supernatant was incubated with 20 µl GFP - trap agarose beads ( Chromotek ) for 60 min at 4°C by overhead rotation . Beads were then washed three times with 500 µl washing buffer WB ( 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 300 mM KCl , 10 % Glycerol ) , combining the heavy , GFP - active Rab21 IP with the light , GFP - inactive Rab21 IP ( forward experiment ) during the second washing step . Pro - teins were eluted from the beads in 100 µl of U / T buffer ( 6 M urea , + 2 M thiourea in 10 mM HEPES , pH 8 . 0 ) for 15 min with shaking at 1400 rpm at room temperature . The eluted proteins were collected and the process repeated a second time to maximize protein yield . Eluted proteins were pre - cipitated by adding 70 µl 2 . 5 M Na - Acetate , pH 5 . 0 , 1 µl GlycoBlue ( Thermo Fisher , USA ) and 1700 µl ethanol to the pooled elution fractions ( 200 µl ) in a 2 ml tube . After an overnight incubation at 4°C , the precipitation mixture was centrifuged for 50 min at 20000x g and the resulting pellet dried for 15 - 20 min at 60 - 70°C . For in - solution protein di - gestion we followed standard procedures 40 . Brieﬂy , pellets were solubilized in U / T buffer , reduced with DTT , alkylated with iodoacetamide and digested by sequential addition of LysC ( Wako ) and Trypsin ( Promega ) overnight at room tem - perature . Peptides were desalted and stored on STAGE tips until LC - MS / MS analysis . Samples were analyzed using 240 min acetonitrile gradients on a 20 cm long 75 µm ID reversed phase column ﬁlled with 3 µm C18 beads ( Dr . Maisch ) using a Proxeon HPLC system ( Thermo Fisher ) coupled to the elec - trospray ion source of a Q Exactive Plus mass spectrometer ( Thermo Fisher ) . The mass spectrometer was operated in the data dependent mode with a full scan ( AGC target 3E6 ; R = 70 , 000 ) followed by up to ten MS2 scans ( R = 17 , 500 ; maxi - mal injection time 60 ms ) and a dynamic exclusion for 30 sec . Raw ﬁles were analyzed using MaxQuant ( version 1 . 5 . 2 . 8 ) using default parameters and searched against a Uniprot hu - man protein database ( 2014 - 10 ) . For visualization purposes , all the identiﬁed proteins from each experiment were plot - ted ( Fig . 1A , Extended Data Fig . 1 ) , where each spot corresponds to one identiﬁed protein by mass spectrometry . Each plot is representative of two independent experiments ( forward and reverse , x - and y - axis ) , where every experi - ment consists of two independent IPs . The proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE 41 partner repository with the dataset identiﬁer PXD016478 . The complete dataset will be made available after publication . The Log10 transformed ratios of the pro - teins identiﬁed by mass spectrometry are also available from the Supplementary Information ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Immunoprecipitations , BICAP and immunoblotting . MDA - MB - 231 or HEK293 cells expressing GFP - tagged or split Venus - tagged ( V1 or V2 ) proteins ( one 10 cm dish per con - dition ) were washed with cold PBS , harvested in PBS and pelleted . The cell pellet was resuspended in 200 µl of IP - lysis buffer ( 40 mM Hepes - NaOH , 75 mM NaCl , 2 mM EDTA , 1 % NP40 , protease and phosphatase inhibitors ) and incubated at + 4 ºC for 30 min , followed by centrifugation ( 10 , 000x g for 10 min , + 4 ºC ) . 20 µl of the supernatant was kept aside as the lysate control . The remainder of the su - pernatant was incubated with GFP - Trap beads ( ChromoTek ; gtak - 20 ) , which bind to both GFP and to complemented Venus ( V1 + V2 ) , for 1 h at 4 ºC . Finally , immunoprecipi - tated complexes were washed three times with wash - buffer Moreno - Layseca et al . | 11 ( 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 1 % NP - 40 ) and de - natured for 5 min at 95ºC in reducing Laemmli buffer before SDS - PAGE analysis under denaturing conditions ( 4 – 20 % Mini - PROTEAN TGX Gels ) . The proteins were then trans - ferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) before blocking with blocking buffer ( Thermo , StartingBlock ( PBS ) blocking , # 37538 ) and PBS ( 1 : 1 ratio ) . The mem - branes were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer overnight at 4°C . Following this step , mem - branes were washed three times with TBST and incubated with ﬂuorophore - conjugated secondary antibodies ( LI - COR ) diluted ( 1 : 10 , 000 ) in blocking buffer at room temperature for 1 hour . Membranes were scanned using an infrared imaging system ( Odyssey ; LI - COR Biosciences ) . Protein puriﬁcation . For producing recombinant GST - tagged Rab21 16 - 225 and swiprosin - 1 , pGEX - 4T1 - Rab21 16 - 225 or pGEX - 4T1 - swiprosin - 1 , BL21 Rosetta trans - formed cells were grown and induced with 250 µM IPTG at OD 0 . 5 - 0 . 8 at 22°C in LB media overnight . Cells were then lysed and resuspended in 20 mM Tris , pH 7 , 5 ; 5 mM MgCl 2 , 300 mM NaCl , 3 mM DTT . The desired GST - tagged protein was puriﬁed from this suspension with a gravity GST - column . In the case of GST - Rab21 , elution of the protein was followed by thrombin - cleavage and gel ﬁltration in 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 50 mM NaCl , 3 mM DTT buffer using a Superdex S75 16 / 60 column attached to a GST - column to bind cleaved GST . Fractions containing the monomeric proteins were pooled , concentrated via ultraﬁltra - tion ( Amicon Ultra , 15 mL , 10 , 000 MWCO ) and ﬂash - frozen in liquid nitrogen for long - term storage at - 80°C . Nucleotide loading and GST pulldowns . To load Rab21 with either GppNHp or GDP , 200 µM of recombinant Rab21 or GST - Rab21 were incubated with 10 mM EDTA and a 25x excess of nucleotide ( 5 mM GppNHp or GDP ) in exchange buffer ( 20 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 2 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 50 mM NaCl and 3 mM DTT ) for 1 h at 25°C . The EDTA - based exchange re - action was then stopped by the addition of 40 mM MgCl 2 and incubation for 15 min on ice . The buffer was then exchanged with measuring buffer ( 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 5 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 50 mM NaCl and 3 mM DTT ) to reach the desired pro - tein concentration using 10 kDa ultraﬁltration devices ( Am - icon ) . Equal amounts of nucleotide compared to the pro - tein amount was added to ensure complete loading of Rab21 with the desired nucleotide . GST pulldowns using puriﬁed GST fusion proteins and recombinant Rab21 bound to a non - hydrolysable form of GTP ( GppNHp ) , GDP or no nucleotide ( in the presence of EDTA ) were performed as follows . 50 µg of GST - swiprosin - 1 or GST - Appl1 was incubated with 200 µg of recombinant Rab21 for 30 min before incubation with Glutathione Sepharose beads for an additional 30 min . The proteins bound to the beads were divided in 2 fractions and separated by SDS - PAGE electrophoresis , followed by either Coomassie staining or immunoblotting with anti - Rab21 anti - body . Pulldowns were performed three times . SIM microscopy and co - localization analysis . Cells grow - ing on collagen - 1 - coated dishes were ﬁxed with 2 % formaldehyde , permeabilized with 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 , blocked with 10 % horse serum and incubated with anti - bodies against the indicated endogenous proteins . This was followed by incubation with ﬂuorophore - labelled secondary antibodies ( Alexa - 568 or Alexa - 488 anti - mouse or anti - rabbit , Life Technologies ) . For visualization of swiprosin - 1 - containing invaginations , cells expressing mScarlet - I - swiprosin - 1 were incubated at 4°C for 30 min before ﬁxation . Cells were imaged with an OMX DeltaVision and spots co - localization analysis was performed in Z stacks of the cells using the plugin ComDet in ImageJ ( https : / / imagej . net / Spots _ colocalization _ ( ComDet ) ) , which al - lowed for a better detection of the invaginations since it ig - nores inhomogeneous cytoplasmic background . Using this plugin , we pinpointed the mScarlet - I - swiprosin - 1 spots ( pixel size above 5 ) , and analyzed co - localization , based on prox - imity ( pixel distance 4 ) , with spots from the second chan - nel stained for the protein of interest . Then , the ratio of co - localization with mScarlet - I - swiprosin - 1 was calculated as a percentage of co - localized spots per cell . At least 30 cells per condition were imaged and analyzed . Co - localization plots show mean ± 95 % CI . Statistical signiﬁcance was calculated compared to the control condition . Representative rendered images of the invaginations ( x - z plane ) were visualized with IMARIS software ( Oxford Instruments ) . Proximity Ligation Assay ( PLA ) . MDA - MB - 231 cells grow - ing on coverslips were ﬁxed , washed twice with PBS and per - meabilized with 0 . 3 % Triton - X - 100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature . Cells were stained using anti - swiprosin - 1 ( 1 : 100 ) and anti - Rab21 ( 1 : 50 ) primary antibodies diluted in 5 % horse serum for 1 h at room temperature . Proxim - ity ligation was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( Duolink in situ PLA , Sigma - Aldrich ) . Interac - tion between swiprosin - 1 and Rab21 in cells was detected using confocal microscopy ( Leica TCS SP5 , 63x1 . 4 Apo oil objective ) and the number of PLA spots per 1000 µm 3 was quantiﬁed using IMARIS software . BiFC and TIRF microscopy . MDA - MB - 231 cells growing in glass - bottom dishes were co - transfected with split Venus constructs ( pDEST - V1 - Rab21 and pDEST - swiprosin - 1 - V2 ) and imaged 30 h after transfection . Imaging was performed using a DeltaVision OMX v4 ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) ﬁtted with an Olympus APO N 60x Oil TIRF objective lens , 1 . 49 NA used in TIRF illumination mode . Emitted light was collected on a front illuminated pco . edge sCMOS ( pixel size 6 . 5 mm , readout speed 95 MHz ; PCO AG ) controlled by SoftWorx . The TIRF angle for all channels was maintained at 83 . 5º . Images were taken every 500 ms for 2 min , at 37 °C in presence of 5 % CO 2 . DNA paint . For two - color single molecule localization mi - croscopy ( SMLM ) ( Extended Data Fig . 4 ) , we used DNA - PAINT 23 . Cells over - expressing EFHD2 - GFP and ARF1 - HA were ﬁxed and labeled using primary antibodies against 12 Moreno - Layseca et al . | GFP ( Abcam ab1218 ) and HA - tag ( Cell Signaling 3724 ) , respectively . Cells were then stained with appropriate sec - ondary antibodies coupled to PAINT DNA handles ( Ultivue ) . Imaging was performed using a DeltaVision OMX v4 ( GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) ﬁtted with an Olympus APO N 60x Oil TIRF objective lens , 1 . 49 NA used in TIRF illumina - tion mode . Emitted light was collected on a front illuminated pco . edge sCMOS ( pixel size 6 . 5 mm , readout speed 95 MHz ; PCO AG ) controlled by SoftWorx . First , a TIRF image of EFHD2 - GFP was acquired , followed by the DNA - paint ac - quisitions . DNA paint imaging was done sequentially ﬁrst for EFHD2 - GFP ( 10 000 frames , 50 ms ) and for ARF1 ( 10 000 frames , 100 ms ) in PAINT buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl , 100 mM NaCl , 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 , pH 7 . 5 ) supplemented with 0 . 5 nM of the corresponding PAINT imager strands coupled to Alex - aFluor 647 ( EFHD2 - GFP ) or to AlexaFluor 568 ( ARF1 ) . For both conditions , full laser power was used and the beam con - centrator enabled . No cross talk between the channels was observed . The ThunderSTORM 42 ImageJ plugin 43 , with the Phasor - based localization 2D method 44 , was used for the localization of single ﬂuorophores . After ﬁltering out local - izations to reject too low photon counts , translational shifts were corrected by autocorrelation . Image reconstructions were performed using the ThunderSTORM ImageJ plugin . Uptake / endocytosis assays . MDA - MB - 231 cells were grown on collagen - 1 coated - dishes or coverslips unless stated otherwise . For integrin endocytosis assays , surface integrins were labelled with an antibody that recognizes the active con - formation of β 1 - integrins ( 12G10 ) at 4 °C followed by in - cubation at 37 °C for 15 min unless stated otherwise . The antibody still left on the surface was washed away with acid ( 0 . 2 M Acetic acid , 0 . 5 M NaCl pH 2 . 5 ) . The cells were sub - sequently ﬁxed with 2 % formaldehyde , permeabilized with 0 . 05 % saponin and incubated with a ﬂuorescent secondary antibody to visualize and quantify the amount of internalized integrins . Several ﬁelds were randomly imaged with iden - tical microscope settings using a 3i ( Intelligent Imaging In - novations , 3i Inc ) Marianas Spinning disk confocal micro - scope with a Yokogawa CSU - W1 scanner and a back illumi - nated 10 MHz EMCDD camera ( Photometrics Evolve ) using 63x / 1 . 4 oil objective . Quantiﬁcation of endocytosed integrins was performed on 3D - projections of the cells using IMARIS software with the spots detection function . The intensity sum of all the vesicles per cell was divided by the volume of that cell . All the intensity values were then normalized to the average of all the cells in the control condition ( siC - TRL ) . A similar procedure was followed for the uptake of MHCI ( SAB4700637 Sigma ) and 9EG7 ( active β 1 - integrin ) . For AlexaFluor 568 - labelled transferrin ( Transferrin - AF568 , Thermo Fisher T23365 ) and 10 kDa dextran uptake exper - iments , cells were treated with 1 mg / mL of transferrin , 10 kDa dextran - TMR ( D1816 , Invitrogen ) or 10 kDa amino dex - tran ( Molecular Probes ) conjugated to FITC during the 15 min incubation at 37°C . In the case of the double uptake ex - periments , cells were previously labelled with 12G10 - AF488 antibody ( Abcam , ab202641 ) at 4°C as described above . Af - ter the internalization step at at 37°C , the remaining ﬂuores - cently labelled molecules at the cell surface were removed with an acid wash , followed by ﬁxation , labelling of plasma membrane with WGA lectin and imaging as described above . Electron microscopy and Apex labelling . Apex labeling of GFP - swiprosin - 1 for electron microscopy was performed as previously described 28 . Brieﬂy , MEFs were transfected with GFP - swiprosin - 1 and GBP - Apex ( Addgene plasmid 67651 ) constructs using a Neon transfection system ( as per manu - facturer’s instructions ) and plated into 35 mm tissue culture dishes . 24 h post transfection , cells were incubated on ice for 30 min , then ﬁxed in 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde , washed 3x in ca - codylate buffer and once in 1 mg / ml 3 , 3 - diaminobenzidine ( DAB ; Sigma - Aldrich ) solution in cacodylate for 5 min . Cells were then subjected to the DAB reaction in the pres - ence of H2O2 for 30 min and , stained with 1 % osmium tetroxide for 2 min . The cells were processed in situ with serial dehydration in increasing percentages of ethanol , then serial inﬁltration with LX112 resin in a Pelco Biowave mi - crowave before polymerizing overnight at 60°C . Ultra - thin ( 60 nm ) sections were cut on a Leica UC6 microtome paral - lel to the culture dish and micrographs acquired using a Jeol 1011 transmission electron microscope . Vesicle tracking . For Rab21 vesicle tracking , MDA - MB - 231 cells stably expressing GFP - Rab21 were transfected with one of two different siRNA sequences to deplete the levels of swiprosin - 1 . The movement of the Rab21 vesicles was fol - lowed for 2 min using TIRF microscopy ( Visitron SD - TIRF Nikon Eclipse TiE with a 60x Olympus TIRF oil objective , NA : 1 . 49 ) . The average speed of the vesicles was measured in each cell . At least 10 cells per condition were analyzed and data from 3 independent experiments was quantiﬁed . Focal adhesion analysis . Cells were plated on dishes coated with the indicated extracellular matrix component ( collagen I , laminin - 1 or ﬁbronectin ) , ﬁxed and immunos - tained with an antibody that recognizes the focal adhesion component vinculin , present in mature adhesions . At least 6 cells per condition per experiment were imaged and analyzed ( 18 cells per condition in total from 3 independent experi - ments ) . Vinculin - positive focal adhesions were detected from an image mask created using the ImageJ software following background subtraction and setting of median Gaussian ﬁlter ( 3 . 0 ) . The number of focal adhesions ( detected particles ) and the total cell area occupied by focal adhesions per cell was quantiﬁed from the image mask . Plots show mean ± 95 % CI . Adhesion dynamics . For adhesion dynamics studies , MDA - MB - 231 cells transiently expressing GFP - paxillin were transfected with one of two different siRNA sequences to deplete the levels of swiprosin - 1 . GFP - paxillin was im - aged for 120 min at the TIRF plane with a Deltavision OMX using a 63x objective . Cells were imaged every 1 min , at 37°C in presence of 5 % CO2 , using multiposition capabili - ties . Focal adhesion dynamics were then analyzed using the Focal Adhesion Analysis Server 45 . Only focal adhesions with a lifetime minimum of 10 frames were analyzed , and Moreno - Layseca et al . | 13 the focal adhesions that were assembled and disassembled during the course of imaging were used for measuring focal adhesion kinetics . Migration assay . After siRNA transfection , MDA - MB - 231 cells were seeded into ibidi 2 - well culture inserts placed in ibidi µ - dishes and allowed to become conﬂuent . Prior to imaging , the culture inserts were carefully removed with for - ceps and the cells were washed twice with PBS . Next , warm medium was added to the cells after which live imaging was started immediately ( 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 ) . Cells were imaged using a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 - E microscope with a 10x objective for 24 h with a 20 minute imaging interval . Data was quanti - ﬁed using Fiji ( ImageJ ) by measuring the area of the closing gap between the cells at 0 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 16 , and 18 h . Invasion assay . 200 µl of PureCol EZ gel ( # 5074 ; Ad - vanced Biomatrix ) was allowed to polymerize in 8 µm in - serts ( 662638 ; Greiner Bio - One ) for 1 h at 37 °C . Inserts were then inverted and 100 µl of cell suspension ( 50000 cells ) were seeded onto the outer face of the insert . Cells were allowed to adhere at 37 °C for 3 h . Inserts were then dipped sequen - tially into PBS and placed in serum - free medium . Medium supplemented with 10 % of FCS and 20 ng / ml of EGF was placed on top of the matrix and cells were allowed to invade the matrix for 72 h . Cells were then ﬁxed using 4 % PFA for 2 h , permeabilized in 0 . 3 % Triton - X 100 for 1 h at room tem - perature , and stained overnight at 4 °C using Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin . Invading cells were imaged using a confocal mi - croscope ( LSM880 ; Zeiss ) . Invasion was quantiﬁed using the area calculator plugin in ImageJ , measuring the ﬂuorescence intensity of cells invading 60 µm or more and expressing this as a percentage of the ﬂuorescence intensity of all cells within the matrix . Statistical analysis for in vitro samples . The GraphPad Prism software and two - tailed Student’s t test ( paired or un - paired , as appropriate ) was used for statistical analysis . When data were not normally distributed , a MannWhitney test was used . P values < 0 . 05 are shown in graphs . For all graphs , ns = not signiﬁcant . Breast cancer tissue microarrays . The study was approved by the Hospital District of Southwest Finland and Turku Uni - versity Hospital ( decision T012 / 015 / 19 ) and the use of tissue samples was approved by the Scientiﬁc Steering Group of Auria Biobank ( decision AB19 - 4522 ) . The study population consisted of 243 patients with breast cancer diagnosed and treated in Turku University Hospital in 1998 - 2013 . All pa - tients were treated with surgical resection or mastectomy and the archived formalin ﬁxed , parafﬁn - embedded tumor sam - ples were used to form tissue microarrays ( TMAs ) that were prepared similarly as previously described 46 . Brieﬂy , the TMAs were prepared by punching a representative site of parafﬁn block of each tumor with either a 1 mm or a 1 . 5 mm diameter cylinder and using an automated tissue arrayer ( TMA Grand Master , 3DHISTECH Ltd . , Budapest , Hun - gary ) . The cohort consisted of 149 patients with triple nega - tive and 89 patients with HER2 - positive breast cancer diag - nosed using the WHO classiﬁcation criteria of tumors of the breast at the time of sampling . In addition , 4 patients with hormone receptor positive and 1 with non - neoplastic breast cancer were included in the TMAs . The cores were available from 225 tumor centers , 121 tumor borders , 26 lymph node metastases and 127 tumor areas with inﬂammatory inﬁltrate . All relevant medical records of the patients were reviewed and information on tumor size , histological grade , hormone receptor status , Her2 - oncogene , proliferation marker Ki - 67 and axillary lymph node status were gathered . The follow - up time was until 31st March 2020 and the range of follow - up varied from 1 month to 22 years 3 months ( mean 10 years 2 months ) . Immunohistochemistry . Immunohistochemistry was per - formed on TMAs comprising one or two tissue cores from each tumor site of each patient . The tissue samples were cut into 4µm sections , deparafﬁnized and rehydrated with standard procedures . Heat - mediated antigen retrieval was done for all samples in citrate buffer ( pH 6 ) in a pressure cooker ( Decloaking chamber , Biocare Medical NxGen ) for 20 min . Sections were stained in a semi - automatic Labvi - sion autostainer ( Thermo - Fisher Scientiﬁc ) , where they were washed with washing buffer ( 0 . 05M Tris - HCl pH 7 . 6 , 0 . 05 % Tween 20 ) and the endogenous enzymes were blocked with 3 % H2O2 Tris - HCl for 10 min . This was followed by a block - ing step using Normal Antibody Diluent ( NABD ; Immuno - logic , BD09 - 125 ) , incubation with the primary antibody ( anti - swiprosin - 1 , Atlas Antibodies , diluted 1 : 200 ) for 1h , followed by washes and incubation with the secondary an - tibody ( Goat anti - rabbit HRP , Immunologic DPVB110HRP ) for 30min . Samples were then washed and incubated with the DAB solution ( Bright DAB , Immunologic BS04 - 110 ) for 10 min . After counterstain with Mayer’s HTX , slides were dehy - drated , cleared in xylene and mounted with Pertex . Antibody speciﬁcity was validated on agarose - embedded cell pellets post siRNA transfection ( siCTRL , Swip1 siRNA 1 and Swip1 siRNA # 2 ; Extended Data Fig . 8A ) . For each tumor sample , the percentage of cells with immunopositive signal ( 0 - 100 % ) in cytoplasm and in plasma membrane were scored . Sam - ples with more than 80 % of cells exhibiting positive staining were considered as having high swiprosin - 1 , those with less than 30 % of cells as low swiprosin - 1 and samples in between were considered to have medium swiprosin - 1 levels . Statistical analysis for clinical samples . The statistical analysis was performed with SPSS Statistics 26 ( IBM Corp . , NY , USA ) . Two - tailed p values below 0 . 05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant . The clinical parameters ( age , tumor size and ki67 ) across swiprosin - 1 categories ( < 100 and 100 , or < 80 and 80 ) were evaluated with independent - samples Mann - Whitney U tests . The categorical parameters ( grade and lymph node metastasis status ) were compared with Chi Squared tests or Fisher’s exact tests across swiprosin - 1 cate - gories . Related - samples Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for paired comparisons of tumor centers and other core types . Patients with missing data were censored from the paired comparisons . Overall survival was compared between low 14 Moreno - Layseca et al . | and high percentage of immunopositive cells in the tumor center samples of Her2 + and TNBC patients using Kaplan - Meier plots and log - rank tests : the samples were divided into the following groups : < 100 % or 100 % in the case of the cy - toplasmic signal and < 80 % or 80 % in the case of membranal swiprosin - 1 signal . The Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to assess the hazard ratio of tumor centers with high vs . lower swiprosin - 1 immunopositivity . In the case of non - proportional hazards , the weighted estimation of Cox regression was used 47 . The adjusted Cox analysis was performed relative to the clinical prognostic features . The analysis was performed with R Software for Statistical Com - puting ( version 3 . 6 . 2 , www . r - project . org ) and survival ( ver - sion 3 . 1 . 8 ) and coxphw ( version 4 . 0 . 2 ) packages . Survival differences were quantiﬁed as hazard ratios ( HRs ) with 95 % conﬁdence intervals ( CI ) . Moreno - Layseca et al . | 15
