Their connectiv - ity network needs to be considered for the full un - derstanding of biological phenomena , but the avail - able information on protein – protein associations is incomplete and exhibits varying levels of annota - tion granularity and reliability . The STRING database aims to collect , score and integrate all publicly avail - able sources of protein – protein interaction informa - tion , and to complement these with computational predictions . Its goal is to achieve a comprehen - sive and objective global network , including direct ( physical ) as well as indirect ( functional ) interac - tions . The latest version of STRING ( 11 . 0 ) more than doubles the number of organisms it covers , to 5090 . The most important new feature is an option to up - load entire , genome - wide datasets as input , allow - ing users to visualize subsets as interaction net - works and to perform gene - set enrichment analy - sis on the entire input . For the enrichment analysis , STRING implements well - known classiﬁcation sys - tems such as Gene Ontology and KEGG , but also offers additional , new classiﬁcation systems based on high - throughput text - mining as well as on a hi - erarchical clustering of the association network it - self . The STRING resource is available online at https : / / string - db . org / . INTRODUCTION While an impressive amount of structural and functional information on individual proteins has been amassed ( 1 – 3 ) , our knowledge about their interactions remains more fragmented . Some interactions are quite well documented and understood , for example in the context of three - dimensional reconstructions of large cellular machineries ( 4 – 6 ) , while others are only hinted at so far , through in - direct evidence such as genetic observations or statistical predictions . Furthermore , the space of potential protein – protein interactions is much larger , and also more context - dependent , than the space of intrinsic molecular function of individual molecules . Interactions may not only be limited to certain cell types or certain physiological conditions , but their specificity and strength may vary as well , from obliga - tory , highly specific and stable bindings to more fleeting and relatively unspecific encounters . From a purely functional perspective , proteins can even interact specifically without touching at all , such as when a transcription factor helps to regulate the expression and production of another pro - * To whom correspondence should be addressed .

Arguably , the common denominator of the various forms of protein – protein associations is information flow – – biologically meaningful interfaces have evolved to allow the flow of information through the cell , and they are ultimately essential for implementing a functional system . Hence , it is desirable to collect and integrate all types of protein – protein interactions under one framework ; this then provides support for data analysis pipelines in diverse areas , ranging from disease module identification ( 7 , 8 ) to biomarker discovery ( 9 – 11 ) and allows manual browsing , ad hoc discovery and annotation . Protein – protein interactions can be collected from a number of online databases ( reviewed in ( 12 , 13 ) ) , as well as from individual high - throughput efforts , e . g . ( 14 ) . Pri - mary interaction databases ( 3 , 15 – 18 ) are jointly annotating experimental interaction evidence directly from the source publications , and they are coordinating their efforts through the IMEx consortium ( 19 ) . They provide highly valuable added services such as curating metadata , maintaining com - mon name spaces and devising ontologies and standards . A second source of protein – protein interaction information is provided by computational prediction efforts , some of which are hosted by dedicated databases , e . g . ( 20 , 21 ) . Lastly , a third class of databases is dedicated to protein interac - tions at the widest scope , integrating both primary as well as predicted interactions , often including annotated path - way knowledge , text - mining results , inter - organism trans - fers or other accessory information . The STRING database ( ‘Search Tool for Retrieval of Interacting Genes / Proteins’ ) belongs to this latter class , along with GeneMania ( 22 ) , FunCoup ( 23 ) , I2D ( 24 ) , ConsensusPathDb ( 25 ) , IMP ( 26 ) and HumanNet ( 27 ) – – most of which have recently been reviewed and benchmarked in ( 7 ) . STRING is one of the earliest efforts ( 28 ) and strives to differentiate itself mainly through ( i ) high coverage , ( ii ) ease of use and ( iii ) a consistent scoring system . It currently fea - tures the largest number of organisms ( 5090 ) and proteins ( 24 . 6 million ) , has very broad and diverse , benchmarked data sources and provides intuitive and fast viewers for on - line use . It also features a number of additional data ac - cess points , such as programmatic access through an API , access through a Cytoscape app ( http : / / apps . cytoscape . org / apps / stringapp ) , as well as download pages covering indi - vidual species networks and associated data . The website allows users to log on and store their searches and gene sets , and contains evidence viewers to inspect the underly - ing evidence of any given interaction . It also provides users with high - level information regarding their input / search data , including network enrichment statistics and func - tional enrichment detection , using two different concep - tual frameworks for the latter ( see below ) . Many of the fea - tures of STRING have been made available and described earlier ( 28 – 31 ) and the website is currently accessed by around 3500 distinct users daily ; its hosting facilities have recently been replicated and placed under a commercial load balancer , to provide added stability and capacity . Users can submit multiple proteins simultaneously and visual - ize large networks ; the Cytoscape stringApp can even han - dle network sizes of several thousand proteins . STRING shares its genome - , protein - and name spaces with a num - ber of sister projects , dedicated to orthology ( eggNOG ( 32 ) ) , small molecules ( STITCH ( 33 ) ) , protein abundances ( PaxDB ( 34 ) ) , tissue expression ( TISSUES ( 35 ) ) and viruses ( Viruses . STRING ( 36 ) ) , respectively . Together with other online resources ( including the IMEx consortium , which is one of STRING’s largest primary data sources ) , the STRING database has recently been awarded the status of a European Core Data Resource by ELIXIR , a pan - European bioinformatics initiative dedicated to sus - tainable bioinformatics infrastructure ( 37 ) . As a prerequi - site and consequence of this status , all interaction data and accessory information in STRING are now freely available without restrictions , under the Creative Commons Attribu - tion ( CC BY ) 4 . 0 license . DATABASE CONTENT The basic interaction unit in STRING is the ‘functional as - sociation’ , i . e . a link between two proteins that both con - tribute jointly to a specific biological function ( 38 – 40 ) . For two proteins to be associated this way , they do not need to interact physically . Instead , it is sufficient if at least some part of their functional roles in the cell overlap – – and this overlapping function should be specific enough to broadly qualify as a pathway or functional map ( in contrast , merely sharing ‘metabolism’ as an overlapping function would be too unspecific ) . By this definition , even proteins that an - tagonize each other can be functionally associated , such as an inhibitor and an activator within the same pathway . The desired specificity cutoff for functional associations in STRING roughly corresponds to the annotation granular - ity of KEGG pathway maps ( 41 ) , whereby maps that largely group proteins by homology ( such as ‘ABC transporters’ ) are removed from consideration . All of the association evidence in the STRING database is categorized into one of seven independent ‘channels’ : three prediction channels based on genomic context in - formation ( see below ) , and one channel each for ( i ) co - expression , ( ii ) text - mining , ( iii ) biochemical / genetic data ( ‘experiments’ ) and ( iv ) previously curated pathway and protein - complex knowledge ( ‘databases’ ) . Users can disable all channels individually or in combinations . For each chan - nel , separate interaction scores are available as well as view - ers for inspecting the underlying evidence ( Figure 1 ) . In gen - eral , the interaction scores in STRING do not represent the strength or specificity of a given interaction , but instead are meant to express an approximate confidence , on a scale of zero to one , of the association being true , given all the avail - able evidence . The scores in STRING are benchmarked us - ing the subset of associations for which both protein part - ners are already functionally annotated ; for this , the KEGG pathway maps ( 41 ) are used as a gold standard and they thus implicitly also determine the granularity of the functional associations . Within each channel , the evidence is further subdivided into two sub - scores , one of which represents evidence stem - ming from the organism itself , and the other represents evidence transferred from other organisms . For the latter transfer , the ‘interolog’ concept is applied ( 42 , 43 ) ; STRING uses hierarchically arranged orthologous group relations as Nucleic Acids Research , 2019 , Vol . 47 , Database issue D609 Figure 1 . A typical association network in STRING . The yeast prion - like protein URE2 has been selected as input . The network has been expanded by an additional 10 proteins ( via the ‘More’ button in the STRING interface ) , and the confidence cutoff for showing interaction links has been set to ‘highest’ ( 0 . 900 ) . The insets at the right show how many items of the various evidence types in STRING contributed to this particular network ( counts denote how many records covered at least two of the proteins in the network ; not all of these records contributed high - scoring links after score calibration ) . defined in eggNOG ( 32 ) , in order to transfer associations between organisms where applicable ( described in ( 29 ) ) . The individual protein associations in the various chan - nels are derived , briefly , as follows : The three genomic context prediction channels ( neigh - borhood , fusion , gene co - occurrence ) are the result of sys - tematic all - against - all genome comparisons , aiming to as - sess the consequences of past genome rearrangements , gene gains and losses , as well as gene fusion events . These evolu - tionary events are known to be retained non - randomly with respect to the functional roles of genes , and thus allow the inference of functional associations between genes even for otherwise rarely studied organisms ( genomic context tech - niques are reviewed in ( 44 , 45 ) ) . The co - expression channel is based on gene - by - gene cor - relation tests across a large number of gene expression datasets ( using both transcriptome measurements as well as proteome measurements ) . In the case of transcript data , STRING re - processes and maps the large number of ex - periments stored in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus ( 46 ) , followed by normalization , redundancy reduction and Pearson correlation ( described in ( 29 ) ) . For version 11 , we have further improved the RNAseq co - expression infer - ence pipeline . This was achieved by processing a higher number of RNAseq samples and using the robust biweight midcorrelation ( 47 ) . In addition to NCBI Geo , for a sub - set of species , gene count data was downloaded from the ARCHS4 and ARCHS4 zoo collections ( 48 ) . Protein - based co - expression analysis is new in version 11 of STRING , and as of now it is restricted to one dataset imported as is : namely the ProteomeHD dataset of the Juri Rappsilber lab ( unpublished , https : / / www . proteomehd . net / ) , covering 294 biological conditions measured using SILAC in human cells . ProteomeHD is not based on Pearson correlation , but instead uses the treeClust algo - rithm ( 49 ) ; for STRING , the results of this algorithm are recalibrated and scored using the KEGG benchmark . Each ProteomeHD - provided interaction features a cross - link through which the underlying evidence can be in - spected at the ProteomeHD website . For the experiments channel , all interaction records from the IMEx databases ( plus BioGRID ) , are re - mapped and re - processed : first , duplicate records and datasets are re - moved , and then entire groups of records are benchmarked against KEGG and scored accordingly . The database channel is based on manually curated in - teraction records assembled by expert curators , at KEGG ( 41 ) , Reactome ( 50 ) , BioCyc ( 51 ) and Gene Ontology ( 52 ) , as well as legacy datasets from PID and BioCarta . STRING only retains associations between direct pathway members or within protein complexes . The database channel is the only channel for which score calibration does not apply ; in - D610 Nucleic Acids Research , 2019 , Vol . 47 , Database issue Figure 2 . Functional enrichment analysis of a genome - sized input set . An expression dataset comparing metastatic melanoma cells with normal skin tissue ( 62 ) has been submitted to STRING , with average log fold change values associated to each gene ( negative values signify depletion in the melanoma cells ) . The screenshot shows how STRING presents and groups statistical enrichment observations for a number of pathways and functional subsystems . When hovering with the mouse , the website highlights the corresponding proteins both in the input data on the left side , as well as in the organism - wide network on the right side . The latter can be interactively zoomed until individual proteins and their neighbors become discernible . Here , the highlighted observation shows that the desmosome is downregulated in melanoma cells – – this stands out by way of several publications in PubMed whose discussed proteins ( desmosome proteins ) are strongly enriched at one end of the user input . stead , all associations in this channel receive a high , uniform score ( 0 . 900 ) . At last , for the text - mining channel , STRING conducts statistical co - citation analysis across a large number of scientific texts , including all PubMed abstracts as well as OMIM ( 53 ) . Since version 10 . 5 of STRING , the text cor - pus also contains a subset of full - text articles . For version 11 . 0 , the Medline abstracts ( last updated on 9 June 2018 ) were complemented with open access as well as author - manuscript full text articles available from PMC in BioC XML format ( https : / / arxiv . org / abs / 1804 . 05957 ) ( last up - dated on 17 April 2018 ) . Full - text articles that were not clas - sified as English - language articles were removed ( using fast - Text and a pretrained language identification model for 176 languages ( https : / / arxiv . org / abs / 1607 . 01759 ) ) , as were those that could not be mapped to PubMed . We also removed highly unspecific articles that mention more than 200 rel - evant biomedical entities such as proteins , chemicals , dis - eases or tissues . The final corpus consists of 28 579 637 scientific publications , of which 2 106 542 are available as full - text articles and the remainder as abstracts . While the text - mining pipeline itself has remained unchanged ( last de - scribed in ( 29 ) ) , its dictionary of gene and protein names has been updated to the new set of genomes and the stop - word list improved to increase precision , especially for hu - man proteins . NEW ENRICHMENT DETECTION MODE For users that query the STRING database with a set of proteins ( as opposed to a single query protein only ) , the website computes a functional enrichment analysis in the background ; this can then be inspected and browsed by the user , and includes interactive projections of the results onto the user’s protein network . This functionality has been available since version 9 . 1 , and is based on straightforward over - representation analysis using hypergeometric tests . However , this analysis uses only a small part of the in - formation that the user might have about his or her protein list . First , the original list of proteins might have been much longer , and the user would have had to truncate it ( thus far , STRING enforced an upper limit on the number of query items ) . Second , the list might have had a biologically mean - Nucleic Acids Research , 2019 , Vol . 47 , Database issue D611 ingful ranking , which would have been lost during submis - sion to STRING . Third , each protein might have been as - sociated with some numerical information from the under - lying experiment or study ( such as a log fold change , a mea - sured abundance , a phenotypic outcome , etc . ) . For this type of genome - wide measurements , simple overlap - based over - representation analysis is not the best choice ( 54 – 56 ) . Thus , beginning with version 11 . 0 , STRING offers such users a second option for conducting enrichment analysis . It specifically asks for genome - scale input , with each pro - tein or gene having an associated numerical value ( a mea - surement or statistical metric ) . Of the available methods for searching functional enrichments in such a set , we chose a permutation - based , non - parametric test that performs well in a number of settings , termed ‘Aggregate Fold Change’ ( 56 ) . Briefly , this test works by computing , for each gene set to be tested , the average of all values provided by the user for the constituent genes . This average is then com - pared against averages of randomized gene sets of the same size . Multiple testing correction is applied separately within each functional classification framework ( GO , KEGG , In - terPro , etc . ) , according to Benjamini and Hochberg ( 57 ) , but not across these frameworks as there is significant over - lap between them . For large gene sets , the AFC random - ization method becomes prohibitively slow ; these gene sets are instead tested after converting the user - provided gene values to ranks , using two - sided Kolmogorov – Smirnov test - ing . In addition to the usually applied functional classifi - cation frameworks , STRING uses two additional systems , thus giving users more options and potentially more nov - elty for discovery . The first is based on a hierarchical clus - tering of the STRING network itself . This assumes that tightly connected modules within the network broadly cor - respond to functional units , and has the advantage that it covers a broader scope and potentially also novel modules that may not yet be annotated as pathways . The cluster - ing is based on a confidence diffusion state distance matrix ( 58 , 59 ) computed on the full , organism - wide STRING net - work , which is clustered hierarchically using HPC - CLUST with average linkage ( 60 ) . To compute the DSD matrix , the final , combined STRING - score between proteins is used , and the DSD algorithm is run with default parameters and the ‘ - c’ flag ( confidence ) . Following the clustering proce - dure , all clusters with sizes between 5 and 200 are included in the functional enrichment testing , and reported under their own , separate classification category . The second ad - ditional set for enrichment testing consists of all published papers mapping to the genes in the user’s input . This takes advantage of STRING’s text - mining channel , for which all of PubMed’s abstract and some additional scientific text are already mapped onto STRING’s protein space ( based on identifier matches in the text ) . Detecting publications that are enriched in the user - input ranking provides yet another complementary way of interpreting the input , often with a more fine - grained view . Following the computation of the entire new enrichment option , users are presented with a three - panel view of the re - sults ( Figure 2 ) . There , each enriched functional subset can be highlighted , and tracked back to the user’s input as well as to a pre - rendered , organism - wide STRING network . The layout of the latter is based on a t - SNE - visualization of the network ( 61 ) and can be zoomed and panned inter - actively . OUTLOOK Over the coming years , the STRING team aims to continue tracking all available protein association evidence types and prediction algorithms . One particular focus will be to ex - pand the protein - based co - expression channel , where ad - vances in proteomics throughput and scope lead us to ex - pect growing data support for association searches . With re - gard to the STRING website , we expect to provide tighter integration of functional enrichment and network search re - sults , and are exploring options to provide more context on the various networks ( such as cell type , tissues , organelles ) . We will also strive to provide better interoperability options and increase our list of partnered , crosslinked resources as well as applicable direct data import options to facilitate our regular data updates .
