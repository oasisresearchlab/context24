All of these papers continue to be heavily cited today – more in the 21st century than they were in the last two decades of the 20th . This is because they continue to be central for understanding enzyme regulation , and increasingly important in the age of systems biology . Introduction The paper that popularized the idea of allosteric feedback inhibition is now 50 years old [ 1 ] , although the concept [ 2 ] and the word ‘allosteric’ had appeared a little earlier , in the latter case only in the printed record [ 3 ] , not spoken at the symposium itself . Its importance is that it explained some puzzling observa - tions that had been accumulating . General ideas of enzyme inhibition had been known for many years , starting with Henri’s observations on invertase [ 4 , 5 ] and developed by Michaelis and his co - workers [ 6 – 8 ] . However , the older observations seemed to require the inhibitor to be structurally similar to one or more of the reactants , so that it could directly interact with the active site of the enzyme . The discovery of feedback inhibition [ 9 , 10 ] showed that inhibitors could have physiological roles independent of any structural similarity with the molecules involved in the catalysed reaction . For example , phosphoribosyl - ATP pyrophos - phorylase catalyses the ﬁrst committed step in the bio - synthesis of histidine , and is inhibited by histidine , which is structurally quite different from the substrates ( phosphoribosyl - ATP and water ) and products ( phos - phoribosyl - AMP and pyrophosphate ) of the reaction . Moreover , mild treatment of the enzyme with Hg 2 + ions destroys the sensitivity of the catalytic activity to histidine but affects neither the uninhibited activity nor the binding of histidine [ 11 ] . Many regulatory enzymes also display allosteric activation , and a single effector often acts in opposite directions on opposing reactions : for example , in many organisms AMP is an allosteric inhibitor of fructose bisphosphatase and an allosteric activator of phosphofructokinase . FEBS Journal 281 ( 2014 ) 621 – 632 ª 2013 FEBS 621 Observations of this kind were difﬁcult to explain in terms of classical ideas of enzyme catalysis . The ﬁrst satisfactory explanation came from the concept of an allosteric site ( a ; kk ος rseqe ός : other solid ) , whereby a regulatory molecule could bind to an enzyme at a spe - ciﬁc site clearly distinct from the catalytic site . The existence of such sites implied that changes at one site could affect behaviour at another that was not neces - sarily adjacent , and that in turn was most easily explained in terms of protein ﬂexibility . If a protein molecule were conformationally rigid , an assumption that might not have been explicitly made in earlier dis - cussions of protein structure but was usually implied , then it was not obvious how information could be passed from one site to another unless they were very close to one another . Thus to explain the cooperative binding of oxygen to haemoglobin , Pauling [ 12 ] argued that the binding sites needed to be close enough to one another to interact electronically : ‘in hemoglobin four hemes form a conjugated system’ . Pauling’s interpretation proved to be untenable when the X - ray crystal structure [ 13 ] showed the oxygen - binding sites to be too far apart , the authors saying that ‘the four haem groups are actually wide apart ( 40 (cid:3) A ) excluding any possibility of direct interac - tion’ [ 14 ] . As early as 1951 Wyman and Allen [ 15 ] had suggested that conformational changes could account for long - range effects in haemoglobin . This idea was taken up in the allosteric model of cooperativity [ 14 ] , to be discussed shortly ; conformational mobility as an explanation of various enzyme properties received a major stimulus from the theory of induced ﬁt [ 16 , 17 ] . Koshland originally proposed this to explain puzzling aspects of enzyme speciﬁcity – for example , why is water a very poor substrate for yeast hexokinase , despite being more reactive than glucose and easily able to reach the active site ? At that time he was not primarily interested in enzyme regulation , and in his later account of the origins of the theory [ 18 ] he did not mention it : One of the great lessons of my life derived from the publication of the induced - ﬁt theory . I was sup - posed to give a talk at a well - known symposium on my oxygen 18 ( O 18 ) work , but decided to speak instead about new research on the speciﬁcity of pro - teins . As I was preparing the talk I was going through the classical explanation for the manner in which substrates are excluded from active sites and decided the ‘key - lock’ or ‘template’ theory of Emil Fischer [ 19 ] was too simple . The theory provided no explanation for the low enzymatic reactivity of water … Although we did many experiments that in my opinion could only be explained by the induced - ﬁt theory , gaining acceptance for the theory was still an uphill ﬁght . One referee wrote , ‘The Fischer Key - Lock theory has lasted 100 years and will not be overturned by speculation from an embryonic scientist’ . [ Reference added ] Induced ﬁt had the broader implication that protein ﬂexibility could have a physiological function , how - ever , so it was more than just a side effect of the forces that maintain protein structure . Its importance went beyond speciﬁcity alone , therefore , as was already rec - ognized in the original account of allosteric interactions [ 3 ] . It was understood very soon that these ideas were not restricted to soluble regulatory enzymes and that they could also be applied to membrane proteins , and speciﬁcally those that mediate synaptic transmission [ 20 – 22 ] . In the subsequent half - century this has become a major ﬁeld of research on its own , central to the development of neurochemistry . The systems stud - ied include , for example , nicotinic acetylcholine recep - tors [ 23 ] , glutamate receptors [ 24 ] , G - protein - coupled receptors [ 25 , 26 ] and many others . Conformational regulation then became a central feature of the allosteric model of cooperativity . The two essential features that distinguish it from other models of cooperativity are ﬁrst that an equilibrium exists between two conformational states , usually known as the R ( ‘relaxed’ ) and T ( ‘tense’ ) states , in the absence of any ligand , and second that symmetry is maintained , so that all of the subunits in an oligomeric protein change between the R and T states in a concerted manner . Dif - ferent ligands bind preferentially to one of the two states , and thus perturb the equilibrium between them . Some authors [ 27 – 29 ] have preferred to call it the sym - metry model or concerted model , but here I shall follow the term used by the original authors [ 14 ] . The sequential model , the principal alternative , appeared a little later [ 27 ] and did not require confor - mational symmetry but did require a strict application of induced ﬁt , with one conformation existing only when ligand is bound and another existing only when ligand is not bound . Many authors [ 29 – 32 ] have noted that both models can be regarded as special cases of more general models in which neither conformational symmetry nor strict induced ﬁt is maintained . Although these generalizations are clearly correct , they have not proved to be very useful , and most experi - mentalists have preferred to interpret their data in terms of one of the original models , nowadays almost always the allosteric model . To this day they constitute 622 FEBS Journal 281 ( 2014 ) 621 – 632 ª 2013 FEBS Allosteric and cooperative interactions in enzymes A . Cornish - Bowden the foundation on which nearly all attempts to under - stand cooperative interactions in enzymes are built . Nonetheless , Cui and Karplus [ 32 ] point out that Both the MWC [ Monod – Wyman – Changeux model ] and the Pauling - KNF [ Pauling / Koshland – N (cid:1) eme - thy – Filmer ] models are phenomenological , and so do not answer the fundamental question of how the binding of a ligand or its modiﬁcation yield the observed allosteric effect at an atomic level of detail . Present day applications of computational methods to biomolecular systems , combined with structural , thermodynamic , and kinetic studies , make possible an approach to that question , so as to provide a deeper understanding of the requirements for allostery . Any such deeper understanding will surely involve models in which induced ﬁt or conformational symme - try are not assumed but follow automatically from the mechanism . Recently , Dyachenko and co - workers [ 32a ] have described how mass spectrometry can be used to determine the amounts of all the different spe - cies that occur as a ligand binds to a protein , and have thus made an important step in the direction foreseen by Cui and Karplus . [ This sentence and reference 32a added after original online publication ] . New scientiﬁc ideas rarely spring from nowhere , and the term ‘Pauling - KNF model’ used in the quotation ( with similar terms used by other authors ) is a remin - der that the sequential model [ 27 ] depended on algebra similar to Pauling’s [ 12 ] , though it was based on a fundamentally different view of the mechanism in which binding sites interact at a distance through conformational changes . In a recent discussion of the history of allostery the philosopher Michel Morange [ 33 ] pointed out that The allosteric model was not so different from the model proposed by John Yudkin as early as 1938 to explain the phenomenon of enzymatic adapta - tion , a model favoured by Monod when he initiated the study of this phenomenon : a protein precursor is able to adopt , in the presence of different ligands , multiple conformations with different enzymatic activities [ 34 ] . [ Reference number edited ] Two other explanations of cooperativity are some - times needed . It may happen that an enzyme changes its state of aggregation when a ligand binds . For example , glutamate dehydrogenase from cattle liver undergoes a change from oligomer to monomer when ligands such as GTP bind to it [ 35 ] , and this can gen - erate cooperativity in a manner analogous to that for the allosteric model . Tomkins and Yielding had already argued that this could be a general explanation of cooperativity [ 36 ] , and this possibility was later analysed by two groups [ 37 , 38 ] . Any enzyme for which such an effect is proposed should also show a depen - dence of cooperativity on the enzyme concentration : this was observed for glutamate dehydrogenase but not for others such as threonine deaminase [ 39 ] , so it could not be a universal explanation of cooperativity . In practice , therefore , it is evident when such a model needs to be considered , as it will be known whether different states of oligomerization exist , as for example NAD + - speciﬁc isocitrate dehydrogenase from yeast , which was recently reviewed [ 40 ] . All of these explanations of cooperativity attribute it to interactions between subunits in oligomeric enzymes . They cannot therefore explain cooperativity in mono - meric enzymes , but as no clear examples of this were known until some years afterwards that was not consid - ered to be a problem , and two mechanisms that would allow cooperative kinetics ( but not cooperative binding at equilibrium ) [ 41 , 42 ] were not initially thought to be necessary for explaining any real cases . ( Rabin’s stated objective [ 42 ] , in fact , was not so much to analyse a par - ticular example as to point out that kinetic cooperativity could arise without the need to consider quaternary structure . ) However , rat liver hexokinase D ( ‘glucoki - nase’ ) proved to display cooperativity with respect to its substrate glucose [ 43 – 45 ] , as recently reviewed [ 46 , 47 ] , so the various models that had been proposed to explain cooperativity in monomeric enzymes needed to be examined [ 48 ] . Allosteric interactions as such , of course , do not require subunit interactions and can therefore regulate the activity of monomeric enzymes , such as trypsin - like proteinases [ 49 ] and calpain [ 50 ] . Not all mechanisms for regulating enzyme activity fall into any of the classes so far mentioned , and the most important one involving neither allosteric nor cooperative interactions is regulation by covalent mod - iﬁcation , typically phosphorylation and dephosphory - lation . In a recent review of this subject , starting from the discovery of the phosphorylation of glycogen phosphorylase [ 51 ] , Fischer [ 52 ] wrote about the atmosphere at the end of the 1960s that The question that seemed of concern to most every - one was whether the regulation of a particular system followed the ‘allosteric’ model of Monod [ 14 ] or the ‘induced - ﬁt’ model of Koshland [ 27 ] . And it was perfectly clear to me , for instance , that Jacques [ Monod ] , who was a very close friend , never believed one minute that covalent regulation by protein phos - phorylation could play any fundamental role in enzyme regulation .

Cornish - Bowden Allosteric and cooperative interactions in enzymes Such scepticism was probably justiﬁed at the time , but it is now known from many examples that cova - lent - modiﬁcation mechanisms are fundamental in met - abolic regulation . Action of an allosteric modiﬁer on an enzyme that catalyses a reaction of a covalent - modiﬁcation system allows a very high degree of sen - sitivity : classical regulatory enzymes almost never have Hill coefﬁcients greater than 4 , but systems of interconvertible enzymes can have the equivalent of much higher Hill coefﬁcients , up to 30 with tight con - straints on the possible rate constants and much higher if wider ranges of rate constants are allowed [ 53 – 55 ] . The price to be paid for this increased sensi - tivity , however , is that they need to consume ATP in order to function , because the interconversion reac - tions need to be irreversible in both directions , and hence they must have different co - substrates . It is not necessary , of course , for one single model to account for the whole of any regulatory effect : for example , phenylalanine hydroxylase is regulated both by phos - phorylation and by allosteric effects of phenylalanine and tetrahydrobiopterin [ 56 , 57 ] . Returning to the two principal models of cooper - ativity , it is clear that the allosteric model is now the preferred model for most biochemists , and most of the papers today that mention the sequential model men - tion the allosteric model as well , as illustrated in Fig . 1 , and they often include a statement similar to the following [ 58 ] : The kinetics and regulation of GS [ glycogen synthase ] appear to be adequately described by an MWC model in which phosphorylation acts like a classic allosteric modiﬁer . However , the sequential or Koshland – N (cid:1) emethy – Filmer model [ 27 ] is expected to provide an equally adequate , although more compli - cated , description . [ Reference number edited ] Notice that the paper refers to the ‘MWC model’ but does not give a reference : presumably the point has been reached where the model is so well known that a reference is superﬂuous . There are , in fact , rather few papers that use the sequential model as the principal basis for analysing experimental data . Some mention it in passing [ 59 ] , or refer to ‘a classical KNF paradigm’ without giving any details [ 60 ] , or mention it as an explanation of negative cooperativity [ 61 ] , but papers that include a thorough analysis of experimen - tal data in terms of the sequential model have become virtually non - existent . Reﬁnements Heterotropic interactions The two classical models of cooperativity can deal almost equally well with interactions between equiva - lent ligands : substrate with substrate , inhibitor with inhibitor or activator with activator . Interactions of this kind are called homotropic effects . For positive cooperativity they predict binding curves that are so similar that it is very difﬁcult to distinguish experimen - tally between them . The sequential model can also account for negative homotropic effects , or negative cooperativity , whereas the allosteric model cannot . A B D C Fig . 1 . Citations to classic papers .

Notice that of papers that cite Koshland , N (cid:1) emethy and Filmer [ 27 ] only 14 % ( 36 / 250 ) cite neither of the others . Even this low percentage may be misleading , however , as the allosteric model is now so well known that authors may feel it unnecessary to give a reference , and at least one [ 58 ] of the 36 refers to the ‘ MWC model ’ without a citation . The ﬁgure was drawn from data in Web of Science , checked in March 2013 , so the data for 2013 are very far from complete , and those for 2012 are probably incomplete also . The classic paper of Michaelis and Menten [ 6 ] exhibits an even more dramatic increase in citations during the 21st century [ 62 ] . 624 FEBS Journal 281 ( 2014 ) 621 – 632 ª 2013 FEBS Allosteric and cooperative interactions in enzymes A . Cornish - Bowden However , the appearance of negative cooperativity can also arise for less interesting reasons , for example if the enzyme preparation is impure , or if it is pure but has subunits that are not identical ; the latter explana - tion applies , for example , to the binding of oxygen to haemoglobin IV from trout , which is cooperative at pH 7 . 7 but negatively cooperative at pH 6 . 1 [ 63 ] . The difference is much greater for heterotropic effects , or effects of binding of one kind of ligand , such as an inhibitor , on the binding of another , such as the substrate . Heterotropic effects are of great phys - iological importance , and most examples of cooper - ativity are examples of cooperative binding of inhibitors or activators ; cooperative binding of sub - strates is rather rare except when it is induced as a side effect of allosteric inhibition or activation [ 64 ] . The allosteric model can handle heterotropic effects in such a natural and simple way that they were included in the original description of the model [ 14 ] : an allosteric inhibitor binds to the opposite conformation from the one that favours binding of substrate , and an allosteric activator binds to the same conformation as the one that favours binding of substrate : it is just a matter of displacing an equilibrium , with the ligand ‘selecting’ a particular state from those available . In a study of phosphofructokinase from Escherichia coli , therefore , no special assumptions needed to be added to the basic model to account quantitatively for the recipro - cal effects of binding the substrates fructose 6 - phos - phate and ATP , the inhibitor ADP and the activator phosphoenolpyruvate [ 65 ] . By contrast , the sequential model requires so many different cases to be considered that it becomes very complicated [ 66 – 68 ] , with far more possibilities to be checked than one can hope to distinguish experimen - tally . This does not mean , of course , that the sequen - tial model is incorrect , but it does mean that there have been very few attempts to apply it to real experi - mental examples of heterotropic effects , as discrimina - tion between the different possibilities would require an unrealistically large amount of data . Reversibility and disequilibrium The classical models for handling subunit interactions ignore two points that are normally regarded as important for discussing enzyme - catalysed reactions : that they are reversible and that the binding of sub - strate in the steady state is not the same as binding at equilibrium [ 69 ] . Reversibility is less of a problem than it may appear , however , because tightly regulated reactions , such as that catalysed by phosphofructoki - nase , normally have large equilibrium constants favouring the physiological direction of reaction , and if necessary they are reversed by different reactions : for example , conversion of fructose 1 , 6 - bisphosphate to fructose 6 - phosphate is catalysed by fructose bis - phosphatase , also a tightly regulated enzyme , not by phosphofructokinase . Reversibility complicates the already complicated equations for the classical models to the point that it becomes impractical to apply them , but is more easily incorporated in the Hill equation , originally proposed [ 70 ] as an empirical equation to describe the binding of oxygen to haemoglobin and now very useful for quantifying the degree of cooperativity . In its usual irreversible form it is v ¼ Va h a h 0 : 5 þ a h ( 1 ) in which v is the rate at substrate concentration a , V is the limiting rate at saturation , a 0 . 5 is the concentration at which v = 0 . 5 V and h is the Hill coefﬁcient , which varies from 1 for non - cooperative enzymes to larger values ( not usually exceeding 4 ) for cooperative enzymes . It can be generalized to the following reversible equation [ 64 ] : v ¼ Vaa 0 : 5 (cid:2) 1 (cid:3) p = aK (cid:1) (cid:3) (cid:2) aa 0 : 5 þ pp 0 : 5 (cid:1) (cid:3) h (cid:3) 1 1 þ aa 0 : 5 þ pp 0 : 5 (cid:1) (cid:3) h ( 2 ) in which p is the product concentration , p 0 . 5 is the value of p at half saturation and K is the equilibrium constant , i . e . the value of p / a at equilibrium . Although this equation is certainly more complicated than Eqn ( 1 ) , in part because of the need to separate the factor expressing the degree of disequilibrium from the other terms , it is much simpler than the full reversible equations for the classical models would be [ 71 ] . In practice it gives a reasonable ﬁt to experimental data , and it can handle both homotropic and heterotropic effects without great complication [ 64 ] . Since Briggs and Haldane [ 69 ] showed that Micha - elis – Menten kinetics could be explained as readily in terms of non - equilibrium steady - state binding of sub - strates as by the equilibrium process assumed origi - nally , it has been generally recognized that it is neither necessary nor desirable to assume that sub - strates bind at equilibrium . However , except in the case of models for cooperativity in monomeric enzymes ( or , more exactly , enzymes with only one binding site on each molecule ) , for which cooperativity of substrate binding at equilibrium is impossible [ 48 ] , it is assumed that cooperative kinetics simply mimic FEBS Journal 281 ( 2014 ) 621 – 632 ª 2013 FEBS 625 A . Cornish - Bowden Allosteric and cooperative interactions in enzymes what would be observed in equilibrium binding . Although this is in theory unsatisfactory , it is virtu - ally unavoidable if analysis is not to be made hopelessly complicated . Although there have been attempts to handle subunit interactions without assum - ing equilibrium binding [ 72 ] , these have not been widely applied , but an example is provided by the RNA packaging motor in bacteriophages of the Cysto - viridae family [ 73 ] , which shows cooperativity of ATP binding in kinetic experiments but not in equilibrium measurements . Three - dimensional structures of enzymes At the time when the models for allosteric interactions and cooperativity were developed , extremely few three - dimensional structures of proteins were known , just myoglobin [ 74 ] and haemoglobin [ 13 ] . Neither of these is an enzyme , although haemoglobin was often called an ‘honorary enzyme’ in recognition of its great contri - bution to understanding interactions between subunits of oligomeric enzymes . Although structures appeared a little later for lysozyme [ 75 ] , a - chymotrypsin [ 76 ] and ribonuclease [ 77 ] , these are relatively simple enzymes without regulatory properties , and their structures shed no light on the regulatory properties of oligomeric enzymes . Other structures were initially slow to appear , so understanding of allosteric interactions and cooperativity was heavily dependent on kinetics and chemical modiﬁcation . In these early years there was no investigation of protein structures by magnetic resonance , but nuclear magnetic resonance started to be used a little later for enzymes such as phosphorylase [ 78 , 79 ] , as well as for peptides such as oxytocin [ 80 ] and other small proteins such as cytochrome c 3 [ 81 ] . In the last case the para - magnetic iron atom allowed the nuclear data to be supplemented with measurements of electron paramag - netic resonance , which has become an essential tool for studying enzymes containing transition - metal ions in their catalytic sites . It can also be applied to pro - teins that do not contain paramagnetic centres by labelling with nitroxides . This is most easily done with cysteine residues [ 82 ] , but these have the disadvantage that they are relatively rare in proteins and often have functional roles ; however , other choices are now possi - ble , such as tyrosine residues [ 83 ] . Labelling of iodoac - etamide haemoglobin with a paramagnetic derivative of iodoacetamide was in fact used many years ago in one of the ﬁrst attempts to distinguish experimentally between the models of cooperativity : Ogawa and McConnell [ 84 ] used this approach to estimate the change in conformation that accompanies oxygena - tion ; they found a strict proportionality , as expected for the sequential model , which requires the conforma - tional change to be induced by ligand binding and not to occur otherwise , whereas the allosteric model pre - dicts that the conformational change should initially run ahead of the degree of oxygenation . Thanks to the great advances in X - ray crystallogra - phy and magnetic resonance in the subsequent dec - ades , many three - dimensional structures are now known and constitute an essential part of the study of allosteric and cooperative mechanisms . In general these support the idea of conformational symmetry . Enzyme regulation in the age of systems biology At the time when allosteric and cooperative regula - tion of enzymes ﬁrst started to be analysed , attention was focused almost entirely on the individual enzymes that were strictly regulated , which were treated as if they were solely responsible for the ﬂux through a whole pathway . In reality , however , ﬂux control is shared ( unequally ) among all the enzymes in the sys - tem [ 85 , 86 ] , and with the development of systems biology in the past decade this has become widely recognized . This does not mean , of course , that the classical mechanisms of regulation have no physiolog - ical role , but it does mean that their roles are differ - ent from what was thought . In the absence of any feedback inhibition the ﬂux through a pathway would , other things being equal , be determined mainly by the activities of the enzymes at the begin - ning of the pathway , but that is not usually what is needed : feedback inhibition , in fact , allows ﬂux con - trol to be transferred to the pathways that require the end - product ; in other words it allows control by demand rather than by supply [ 87 , 88 ] . The reality may be more complicated , however , as other things will often not be equal [ 88 ] . Computer simulation of some model pathways , such as a simple branched pathway with two different end - products [ 89 ] , showed , in fact , that simple product inhibition , with no feedback inhibition of the ﬁrst step of the entire pathway , or the ‘ﬁrst committed steps’ , i . e . the ﬁrst steps after the branch - point , was quite sufﬁcient to regulate production of end - products according to demand . The price to be paid for this ﬂux regulation is much too high to be tolerated by a living organ - ism , however , because the variation in ﬂux will be accompanied by enormous changes in metabolite concentration . Cooperative feedback inhibition must be seen , therefore , not as a mechanism for regulating ﬂuxes but as a mechanism for maintaining homeosta - sis when ﬂuxes respond to changes in demand , and to 626 FEBS Journal 281 ( 2014 ) 621 – 632 ª 2013 FEBS Allosteric and cooperative interactions in enzymes A . Cornish - Bowden allow information about metabolite concentrations at the end of a metabolic pathway to be transmitted to upstream enzymes [ 90 ] . Negative cooperativity In normal ( positive ) cooperativity binding of a molecule of ligand increases the capacity to bind others , but sometimes one observes the opposite , known as nega - tive cooperativity . This was ﬁrst reported under that name for glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase from rabbit muscle , in which each molecule of NAD + that binds to the tetrameric protein decreases the capac - ity of further molecules to bind [ 91 ] ; a somewhat earlier example , for glutamate dehydrogenase , had been des - cribed as ‘antagonistic homotropic interactions’ [ 92 ] . At that time the principal and almost the only interest of negative cooperativity was that the sequential model could explain it and the allosteric model could not , unless some of the original restrictions were relaxed [ 93 – 95 ] . Later it was found that various enzymes , such as cytidine triphosphate synthetase [ 96 ] , could readily be brought close to half - saturation but not to full satu - ration : in such enzymes a tetramer of apparently identi - cal subunits would behave like a dimer . This behaviour came to be known as half - of - the - sites reactivity , but its function remained obscure . The physiological value of increasing the sensitivity of a response to a signal seemed obvious , but what could be the value of decreasing it ? Levitzki [ 97 ] suggested that low sensitivity at high ligand concentrations might be a price that needed to be paid for obtaining high sensitivity at low concentrations , but it was unclear if this explanation was tenable [ 98 ] , and the physiological role of negative cooperativity has remained mysterious . A possible rationale may be found by focusing , as suggested by Atkinson [ 99 ] , on the sensitivity of con - centrations to rates rather than the opposite . As kinetic experiments are usually designed so that the experimenter chooses concentrations of substrate and effectors and the enzyme responds with the appropri - ate rates , this reversal of dependent and independent variables may seem strange . In the physiological con - text , however , an enzyme operating in the middle of a metabolic pathway has little inﬂuence on the rate of the reaction it catalyses and must adjust the concentra - tions of substrate and product to the rate at which the substrate arrives : then Atkinson’s point of view makes more sense . It follows that if a particular metabolite concentration acts as an inhibitor or activator of a dif - ferent pathway then negative cooperativity in the path - way for which it is a substrate will increase its effectiveness as a signal [ 100 ] . Current applications to experimental data Nearly half a century after they were ﬁrst proposed , the classical models of cooperativity [ 14 , 27 ] , together with the theory of allosteric interactions [ 1 , 3 ] , remain the basis for nearly all attempts to analyse the mecha - nistic basis of regulation , not only for enzymes such as aspartate transcarbamoylase , but also for similar but different systems , such as ion channels . Examples of these two cases are now illustrated , and others may be found elsewhere [ 101 ] . Aspartate transcarbamoylase Aspartate transcarbamoylase , which regulates the bio - synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides , has long been the textbook example of an enzyme analysed in terms of allosteric feedback inhibition ( by cytidine triphosphate ) and the allosteric model of cooperativity [ 102 – 104 ] , and remains so today [ 105 ] . Its three - dimensional structure , ﬁrst determined in 1972 at 5 . 8 (cid:3) A resolution [ 106 ] , is now known with high precision , both for the holoenzyme with various ligands bound , such as N - phosphonacetyl - L - aspartate ( PALA ) [ 107 ] , and for the catalytic subunit [ 108 ] . This structural information , combined with numerous studies of the kinetic and catalytic mechanism , have allowed the nature of the two states of the enzyme required by the allosteric model , and the transition between them , to be under - stood in considerable detail . Kantrowitz’s review [ 105 ] describes the history of these investigations and the present state of knowledge , which continues to be in accordance with the two - state allosteric model suggested half a century ago . Allosteric coupling in ligand - gated channels Although enzyme mechanisms remain the principal focus of interest in allosteric interactions and models of cooperativity , they are also widely evoked in other domains , and in a recent paper Colquhoun and Lape [ 109 ] discuss their application to ion channels . They begin by noting that the word allosteric is used very loosely , and sometimes means little more than ‘we have got an antagonist and we are not sure what it does , but it appears not to be competitive’ , but they point out that the original meaning given by Monod and Jacob [ 3 ] was much more precise : ‘From the point of view of mechanisms , the most remarkable feature of the [ inhibition of the synthesis of a trypto - phan precursor by tryptophan ] is that the inhibitor is not a steric analogue of the substrate . We therefore FEBS Journal 281 ( 2014 ) 621 – 632 ª 2013 FEBS 627 A . Cornish - Bowden Allosteric and cooperative interactions in enzymes propose to designate this mechanism as “allosteric inhibition” . ’ As an ion channel can be either ‘open’ or ‘shut’ , and as any ligand may favour one or the other state , it may be an ideal system to interpret in terms of the allosteric model [ 14 ] . In practice , although it has been applied with some success to some channels , such as the nicotinic receptor [ 110 ] , Colquhoun and Lape con - sider that it provides less than perfect results because it does not allow for the number of distinct shut states that can exist . Concluding remarks It has become clear that the allosteric model [ 14 ] has essentially overwhelmed the sequential model [ 27 ] in the eyes of nearly all biochemists . When the latter is mentioned at all it is usually as an afterthought , as in the example quoted earlier [ 58 ] . It is not just a popularity contest , however , but a matter of which model has proved the more capable of accounting for new experimental data . I have said rather little about such new data , preferring to concentrate on the his - torical aspects , which are in the process of being for - gotten ( in the last two or three years I have attended lectures , in major international congresses , by scien - tists who appear to think that the lock - and - key model [ 19 ] remains the basic theory of enzyme speci - ﬁcity , or that only now are magnetic resonance stud - ies revealing the existence of protein ﬂexibility ) . However , the classical models of cooperativity con - tinue to show great vitality and to be the focus of many new experiments , such as studies of chapero - nins [ 111 ] , clathrins [ 112 ] and many others , as is already evident from Fig . 1 . At ﬁrst sight one might think that there is no rela - tionship between the arguments over these two models and the arguments over the nature of evolution , whether by natural selection or by a ‘Larmarckian’ process ( the quotation marks are to take account of the fact that the adjective does not accurately represent Lamarck’s thinking [ 113 ] and that in his later years Darwin was no less ‘Lamarckian’ than Lamarck ) . There are parallels , however , because the sequential model , and in particular induced ﬁt , assumes a Larm - arckian process in which the ligand ‘instructs’ a pro - tein to adopt a particular conformation , whereas the allosteric model assumes a process in which the ligand ‘selects’ one out of two or more pre - existing conforma - tions [ 114 ] . As Morange [ 33 ] has noted , the parallels between models of evolution and models of cooperativity ‘did not displease Monod’ . I must end on a sad note .
