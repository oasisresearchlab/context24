Fletcher 1 , 4 Directional polymerization of actin filaments in branched networks is one of the most powerful force - generating systems in eukaryotic cells 1 . Growth of densely cross - linked actin networks drives cell crawling 2 , intracellular transport of vesicles and organelles 3 , 4 , and movement of intracellular pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes 5 . Using a modified atomic force microscope ( AFM ) , we obtained force – velocity ( Fv ) measurements of growing actin networks in vitro until network elongation ceased at the stall force . We found that the growth velocity of a branched actin network against increasing forces is load - independent over a wide range of forces before a convex decline to stall . Surprisingly , when force was decreased on a growing network , the velocity increased to a value greater than the previous velocity , such that two or more stable growth velocities can exist at a single load . These results demonstrate that a single Fv relationship does not capture the complete behaviour of this system , unlike other molecular motors in cells , because the growth velocity depends on loading history rather than solely on the instantaneous load . Over the past decade , in vitro reconstitution of actin - based motility using bacteria and functionalized micron - sized beads 6 has led to the characterization and identification of proteins essential for directed movement 7 . However , the physical basis and regulation of force genera - tion by branched actin networks is still under investigation 8 . Conversion of chemical energy into mechanical work by molecular motors or fila - ment polymerization is typically characterized by Fv relationships , which describe velocity in a given biochemical system as a function of only the instantaneous applied force 9 , 10 . Multiple theoretical models posit such Fv relationships for growing actin networks 11 – 15 , but the predictions of these models vary widely because of different assumptions about the effects of filament branching and capping , network elasticity and net - work - load tethering . Fv relationships using reconstituted motility assays of Listeria 16 and beads 17 have been reported where the visco - elasticity of the medium was varied to control the drag force .

Both the Listeria 16 and glass microneedle 18 experiments show a concave decline in velocity with increasing force , as predicted by the tethered Brownian ratchet 11 and elastic gel 13 models . However , no previous study has stalled actin - network growth . Consequently , the extent to which the full force – velocity landscape has been measured is unknown , making the interpretation of these results difficult and raising questions about the behaviour of actin networks under higher loads approaching stall . Here we present measurements of actin network growth through stall against a flexible cantilever in a differential AFM assay . This assay uses two cantilevers to measure displacement over long periods of time . In each experiment , the Listeria nucleation promotion factor , ActA , was nonspecifically adsorbed onto one cantilever ( see Methods ) , initiating formation of a localized , branched actin network between the cantilever and a nearby surface 19 ( Fig . 1 , a – c ) . The second cantilever was used to compensate for unpredictable drift between the surface and cantilevers , thus ensuring spatial stability throughout the experiment ( see Methods and Supplementary Information , Fig . S1 ) . Actin - network growth was measured from the actin - associated cantilever deflection with an opti - cal lever design that is sensitive to nanometre - scale displacements . Although actin polymerization resulted in both cantilever deflection and compression of the existing network , compression was small and was not considered in further analysis ( see Supplementary Information , Part A ) . Network growth was simultaneously monitored with epifluorescence imaging of labelled actin ( Fig . 1 , d – f ) . This force microscopy technique has several key features : first , it is capable of exerting forces up to several hundred nN ; second , it allows active adjustment of the load on the actin network during an experiment ; third , it provides a flat nucleating surface that avoids ambiguities caused by surface curvature 20 . We first measured the Fv relationship by allowing the growing actin network to naturally deflect the cantilever . As the cantilever exerts a restoring force that is proportional to its deflection , the actin network grew against increasing forces until growth stopped at the stall force — similar to single molecule studies with optical traps 21 – 23 . A typical result is shown in Fig . 2a , where the actin network exhibited three print ncb1336 . indd 1219 print ncb1336 . indd 1219 1 / 12 / 05 3 : 17 : 15 pm 1 / 12 / 05 3 : 17 : 15 pm Nature PublishingGroup © 2005 © 2005 Nature Publishing Group 1220 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 7 | NUMBER 12 | DECEMBER 2005 L E T T E R S different growth phases . Initially , there was a developmental phase where the network growth velocity increased against increasing forces ( Fig . 2A , a ) . This developmental phase was also noted in constant force experiments , indicating that it is a transient phenomenon , and it was excluded from further analysis ( see Supplementary Information , Part B , Fig . S2 ) . This was followed by a load - independent phase where the net - work length increased in a linear manner with time against an increasing force ( Fig . 2A , b ) . During this phase the actin network grew at a velocity of ~ 72 nm min – 1 over a 50 – 160 - nN range . Finally , the network entered a stall phase , where the rate of network elongation slowed until it stalled at a force of 294 nN , corresponding to a pressure of ~ 1 nN μm – 2 ( Fig . 2A , c ) . To demonstrate that the observed stall was indeed force - dependent ( and not due to depletion of protein components , for example ) we reduced the force on the stalled network . After force reduction , the network resumed elongation ( see Supplementary Information , Part C , Fig . S3 ) . From measurements of length and force over time , we computed the Fv relationship by differentiating length records to obtain growth veloc - ity . A single Fv trace , based on the data in Fig . 2A , is shown in Fig . 2B . As indicated by the superimposed dashed line ( Fig . 2A , b ) the network growth velocity remained essentially load - independent for more than a third of the force range . This load - independent phase is followed by a convex decline in velocity until stall . Stall forces ( 150 ± 120 nN , mean ± s . d . , n = 10 ) and load - independent velocities ( 85 ± 68 nm min – 1 , mean ± s . d . , n = 10 ) varied significantly among trials primarily due to varia - tions in ActA density and area covered . However , after normalizing the velocity and force for each individual record , all Fv curves collapsed onto each other . This suggests that the average normalized Fv trace ( Fig . 2C ) represents a characteristic behaviour for actin networks growing against increasing loads , which is independent of network area and cantilever stiffness . This trace illustrates both the load - independent growth and convex stalling behaviour . Several models of actin - based motility may explain the load - inde - pendent behaviour noted in Fig . 2C . One explanation is that network growth is limited not by the applied force but rather by force - independ - ent processes , such as the inherent time required for polymerization of actin or nucleation of new filaments 15 , 21 , 24 . Alternatively , it is possible that remodelling of the actin network during growth ( by increased branch - ing , for example ) is responsible for the load - independent behaviour . The autocatalytic model for actin growth proposes a mechanism whereby the density of filaments increases with force to keep the velocity constant 14 . An increase in force causes a transient decrease in network growth veloc - ity , thus allowing more time for filament branching at the load surface . This enhanced branching increases the density of filaments at the load surface so that the force per filament remains constant with increasing load , resulting in a constant velocity . To differentiate between these models we performed a force - reduc - tion experiment ( Fig . 3 ) . The network was allowed to grow until it reached a force of 145 nN with a load - independent velocity of ~ 129 nm min – 1 . The applied load was then reduced to 120 nN — still within the load - independent regime — by gradually retracting the surface with a piezo - electric stage ( see Methods ) . After the force reduction , the load was clamped at 120 nN and the growth velocity was measured . If force - independent kinetics determined the growth velocity from 120 up to 145 nN , then the velocity at 120 nN should not change after a force reduction . Alternatively , if the network underwent structural remodelling ( as in the autocatalytic model ) then the growth velocity would be greater after the force was reduced , but only for a short time . We observed a force decrease of 17 % led to a 2 . 1 - fold increase in velocity to 275 nm min – 1 ( Fig . 3a ) . Surprisingly , this velocity persisted for more than 10 min ( or almost 3 μm of growth ) . In all force - reduction experiments the growth velocity after a 17 – 98 % ( n = 8 ) force reduction was found to stabilize at a value 1 . 75 – 10 . 9 ( mean = 3 . 7 ) - fold higher than the original velocity and persist for as long as data was recorded ( 1 – 4 μm and up to 30 min ) . When actin - network growth naturally deflects the cantilever in the load - independent phase and thus experiences an increasing force , kinetic processes ( such as molecular diffusion and increased compres - sion at higher forces ) may influence the velocity of growth in a transient manner . Under a constant force , however , concentrations are stable so that steady - state velocities are measured . To verify the existence of two growth velocities against the same force , force - clamp - reduction experiments were conducted .

When the force clamp was removed subsequent network growth resulted in increased cantilever deflection and increased force on the network — as in the previous force - reduction experiments . After this period of increasing force , the force on the network was reduced to the initial value and clamped , and the resulting velocity was quantified ( Fig . 3b ) . The velocity during the second force clamp was 1 . 6 - fold greater than the velocity during the first force clamp after a 19 % reduction in force . In all force - clamp - reduction experiments ( n = 8 ) , the growth velocity was found to increase by a factor of 1 . 22 – 3 . 63 ( mean = 2 . 3 ) following a 20 – 95 % reduction in force . Additional control experiments showed that this phenomenon is not dependent on network length ( data not shown ) . These force - clamp - reduction experiments confirm the existence of two steady - state growth velocities against the same load in the same experiment , demonstrating hysteresis in the Fv relationship . Consequently , the velocity of actin - network growth at a given force depends on its loading history , and a single Fv relationship cannot fully describe the behaviour of this system . In the autocatalytic model , filament density is governed by the load velocity and adjusts to prevent changes in velocity as force increases or decreases 14 . This model is consistent with a load - independent growth velocity ( Fig . 2C ) , as well as with the increased velocity immediately after a force reduction ( Fig . 3a , b ) . However , the autocatalytic model predicts that an instantaneous increase in velocity after force reduction will be followed by an exponential return to the previous velocity at that force . We have found that an increased velocity after force reduction continues indefinitely . Although the predicted return to the previous velocity , v 1 , does not occur , increasing filament density with force is a plausible explanation for our observations . In this context , the density of filaments increases to sustain a constant force per filament , resulting in a constant velocity during the load - independent phase as force increases . After reduction in force , the density of filaments stabilizes so that a velocity , v 2 , greater than v 1 , is maintained , rather than exponentially reduced to v 1 . At forces above the load - independent regime , the growth velocity begins to taper off as the network approaches a saturating density of filaments , and growth is stalled soon after . This would suggest a crucial role for actin - filament nucleation in force production . Previous studies have reported increases in actin density with load through fluorescence or phase imaging of actin 16 – 18 , which is consistent with our interpretation . Several molecular mechanisms may be responsible for regulating the number of filaments in the network , such as force - dependent branching or capping rates . If the branching or capping rate depends on the force per filament , then increasing the total force on the network could stimulate a net increase in the filament density . However , simple kinetic models cannot capture the hereditary nature of this system , and other biochemical processes in the extract may influence network organization . Further experiments will be required to elucidate the specific molecular mechanisms involved in remodelling and hysteresis . Our work shows that under an increasing load , actin - network growth is load - independent before stall . From force - reduction experiments , we find that the Fv relationship for a growing actin network depends on its loading history , unlike the Fv relationships of molecular motors or indi - vidual filaments . This is explained by structural remodelling of the actin network , probably due to an increase in the number of working filaments pushing the load .

The observed load - inde - pendent growth regime also suggests that an optimum - force range exists in which crawling cells may operate for robust , stable movement . METHODS Protein preparation . Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle 25 , labelled on random lysines with NHS – rhodamine 26 ( Pierce Biotechnology , Rockford , IL ) , and cycled repeatedly to ensure polymerization competency . Xenopus laevis extract was prepared as previously described 6 . After isolation , crude extract was ultracentrifuged for clarification , aliquoted and stored at – 80 °C . Extract mix was prepared by diluting the clarified extract to 50 % with Xenopus buffer ( XB ; 100 mM KCl , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM EGTA and 10 mM HEPES at pH 7 . 7 ) , spin - filtering through 100 - nm pores ( Millipore , Billerica , MA ) , ) to remove large particulates , and addition of 37 . 5 µ l of 50 % extract to 1 . 7 µ l of energy mix ( 150 mM creating phosphate , 2mM EGTA , 20 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM ATP pH 7 . 4 ) and 2 µ l of rhodamine – actin ( 2 mg ml – 1 ) . Differential AFM . The differential AFM was developed to increase stability of long - time - scale force measurements and will be described in detail elsewhere . Briefly , two silicon nitride cantilevers ( Veeco Metrology , Inc . , Sunnyvale , CA ) were monitored simultaneously with an optical lever design using separate posi - tion sensitive detectors ( PSDs ; Pacific Silicon Sensors , Inc . , Westlake Village , CA ) . The deflection of each cantilever was calibrated with a piezo - electric nanoposi - tioning stage ( Physik Instrumente , L . P . , Palmbach , Germany ) . The instrument was controlled using custom software written in LabView 7 ( National Instruments , Austin , TX ) . Both cantilever position signals were recorded at 100 Hz ( National Instruments ) , anti - aliased to 50 Hz with an eight - pole Butterworth ( Krohn - Hite , Inc . , Brockton , MA ) , and saved for offline processing . Software feedback , also at 100 Hz , was used to control the piezo - electric stage and operate the AFM in dif - ferent modes . Epi - fluorescence imaging was performed using mercury arc - lamp illumination and cooled CCD camera imaging ( Qimaging , Burnaby , Canada ) . The instrument was operated in either drift - clamp or force - clamp mode . In drift - clamp experiments , the actin network was allowed to freely deflect one canti - lever as the second cantilever position was held constant by actively controlling the glass surface , thereby negating the effect of thermal drift and other uncontrolled influences . In force - reduction experiments , once the load - independent phase was reached the glass surface was gradually retracted at ~ 100 nm s −1 . After force reduc - tion , the AFM was operated as a force - clamp by actively controlling the glass sur - face to maintain a constant force on the actin - associated cantilever . In this mode , the growth velocity is reported by the second cantilever , as it is in contact with the surface and reflects displacement under the actin - associated cantilever . Force measurements . Force measurements were conducted using a cantilever with a stiffness of either 20 or 30 pN nm – 1 based on the manufacturer’s value and confirmed with thermal noise measurements 27 . The cantilever was made func - tional by dipping the end into a solution of ActA ( 0 . 4 mg ml – 1 ) for 30 s .

( a ) Actin - network growth proceeded until the load - independent phase was reached , during which the growth velocity ( blue ) was ~ 129 nm min – 1 . At t = 100 min the force ( red ) on the network was reduced from 145 nN to 120 nN , and the force was clamped at 120 nN . The average growth velocity ( grey dotted line ) after the force reduction increased to approximately 275 nm min – 1 , which is ~ 2 . 1 - fold greater than the velocity of network growth previously at 120 nN . This growth velocity persisted for more than 10 min ( 3 µm ) . Inset : a histogram of growth velocity in load - independent phase ( black bars ) and after force reduction ( open bars ) . ( b ) Colour of traces are as in a . Force exerted on the network was initially held constant at 68 nN , then allowed to increase naturally at t = 73 min ( slight decrease in velocity ) . When the force reached 83 nN at t = 79 min , the force was reduced to 68 nN and clamped . After a brief reduction in velocity , the average growth velocity stabilized at 270 nm min – 1 , which is a 1 . 6 - fold increase over the previous velocity of 170 nm min – 1 .

Subsequently , cantilever deflection was calibrated , and the surface was adjusted to a distance of 200 nm from the cantilever after which data acquisition and time - lapse fluorescence microscopy commenced . Network growth was usually detected after ~ 5 – 50 min . We note that our load - independent velocities were markedly slower than those of motility assays , most likely due to the application of larger forces . Data analysis . The cantilever voltage signals were converted to deflection using a deflection map and downsampled to 5 Hz for further processing in Igor Pro 5 ( Wavemetrics , Inc . , Portland , OR ) . The length of the actin network was calcu - lated as the distance between the two cantilevers plus an additional 3 µ m due to the size of the tip . Force was determined by multiplying cantilever deflection by the stiffness . Occasionally ( ~ 1 – 2 times per trial ) particulates in the extract mix temporarily obscured the laser signal and the total laser power decreased . These segments were deleted from the data and replaced with values from a 7 th - order polynomial fitted to the remaining trace . Velocities were obtained from length - time curves by using a Savitzky – Golay filter with a window size corresponding to 6 % of the time for each trial 21 . Force data used in Fv traces was boxcar - smoothed with a 6 . 67 - min window . Each Fv trace was normalized by the load - independent velocity , v L , and force , where v = v L / 2 ( which we refer to as F 1 / 2 , as calculated from a sigmoid fit 21 ) . All normalized Fv curves were averaged to arrive at the average normalized Fv trace . Note : Supplementary Information is available on the Nature Cell Biology website . ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank J .

A . Elasticity of the Actin Network Actin networks are elastic materials and therefore polymerization at the cantilever ( nucleating ) surface results in both compression of the supporting network and deflection of the cantilever s1 , s2 . Treating the network as compressible spring , the fractional amount of growth transduced by the cantilever is : ( 1 ) c a a k k k D + = δ where δ is the deflection of the cantilever , D is the increase in length of the actin network due to polymerization , a k is the stiffness of the actin network , and c k is stiffness of the cantilever . Assuming the network is a homogeneous elastic body with an elastic modulus , E , the stiffness of the network is : ( 2 ) L EA k a = where A is the area of the network and L is the length of the network . For example , if E = 3 . 7 kPa ( average from ref . s2 ) , A = 381 µm 2 , and L = 8 µm , then a k = 0 . 17 nN / nm . In this case , D δ = 0 . 90 and D δ = 0 . 85 for our cantilevers of stiffness c k = 0 . 02 nN / nm and c k = 0 . 03 nN / nm , respectively . In other words , 90 % or 85 % of actin polymerization is transduced into cantilever deflection . For both cantilevers , we observe the same characteristics of load - independent growth , convex stall , and increase in velocity following a force - reduction , suggesting that cantilever deflection measurements reflect the behavior of actin network polymerization . © 2005 Nature Publishing Group © 2005 Nature Publishing Group 2 One possible explanation for the observed history dependence in Fig . 3 is that the network stiffens ( k a increases ) with increasing force . In this case , the increased velocity seen after a force reduction is solely due to an increase in cantilever transduction of actin network growth as described above . Taking the extreme case that E = 700 Pa ( the lower bound from ref . s2 ) , A = 381 µ m 2 , and L = 5 µ m ( average network length during initial force clamp ) gives k a ~ 0 . 054 nN / nm . For a cantilever stiffness of k c = 0 . 02 nN / nm ( as used in force - clamp - reduction experiments ) , the amount of actin growth transduced throughout the experiment is greater than 73 % ( Eq . 1 ) . Therefore the maximum increase in velocity due to network hardening following a force reduction is 1 . 37 fold , which is contingent upon the network becoming completely rigid under increasing forces before the force reduction . This factor of 1 . 37 is smaller than most velocity increases ( 7 out of 8 trials : 1 . 26 - 3 . 5 , mean = 2 . 3 ) observed in force - clamp - reduction experiments . Thus network hardening alone cannot explain the observed history dependence . B . Constant force experiment In a constant force experiment , the cantilever is preloaded by moving the glass surface into contact until the desired force is reached . During the experiment , the surface is actively controlled to keep the cantilever deflection constant . In Figure S2 , the cantilever is preloaded and clamped at 38 . 35 nN . After ~ 115 minutes , the actin network begins to deflect the cantilever . Because the force on the network is not changing in this experiment , we expect a constant growth velocity . However , the developmental phase described in the text ( Fig . 2a ) , in which length increases exponentially with time , also exists in this experiment . The presence of the developmental phase in force - clamp experiments indicates that it is a transient phenomenon that is independent of the applied force . © 2005 Nature Publishing Group © 2005 Nature Publishing Group 3 A reasonable explanation of this behavior is that it is due to the initial formation of actin filaments . Machesky et al . found that Arp2 / 3 nucleation of branches involved the formation of a quaternary complex consisting of F - actin , G - actin , ActA , and the Arp2 / 3 complex s3 . Essentially all actin in the extract mix was in the G - actin form due to ultracentrifugation of the crude extract . Thus , the lack of nascent F - actin may be rate limiting for initial actin network growth until the Arp 2 / 3 complex nucleates enough filaments to provide a stable structure for steady growth . C . Mechanical stall To verify that a force - dependent stall is observed , we reduced the force on a stalled network , and the network resumed elongation ( Fig . S3 ) . References s1 .

The reference cantilever is in hard contact with the surface and is used to compensate for unpredictable drift ( up to 50 nm / min ) over the entire length of the experiment . Actin polymerizes from and deflects the measurement cantilever . This differential approach yields accurate measurement that are not affected by uncontrolled movement between the surface and cantilevers . © 2005 Nature Publishing Group © 2005 Nature Publishing Group 5 Supplementary Figure S2 Figure S2 Constant force experiment . The cantilever force is set to 38 . 35 nN as shown in the top trace . The bottom trace shows the actin network length . The network begins to deflect the cantilever after about 115 minutes ( black ) , and the network length increases super - linearly initially before growing linearly . The presence of the developmental phase in constant force experiments demonstrates that it is independent of force and transient . © 2005 Nature Publishing Group © 2005 Nature Publishing Group 6 Supplementary Figure S3 Figure S3 Force ( red ) and length ( blue ) versus time for actin growth during a mechanical stall test following the experiment illustrated in Figure 2a . Actin network growth was stalled for the first five minutes of this experiment . After the force was reduced from 295 nN to 254 nN , the actin network resumes growth . This demonstrates that stall was force - induced , and not due to depletion of actin or other factors . © 2005 Nature Publishing Group © 2005 Nature Publishing Group
