Role of curvature and phase transition in lipid sorting and ﬁssion of membrane tubules Aure´lien Roux 1 , 2 , 4 , Damien Cuvelier 2 , Pierre Nassoy 2 , Jacques Prost 2 , 3 , Patricia Bassereau 2 , 5 and Bruno Goud 1 , 5 , * 1 UMR 144 CNRS / Institut Curie , Paris , France , 2 UMR 168 CNRS / Institut Curie , Paris , France and 3 ESPCI , Paris , France We have recently developed a minimal system for generat - ing long tubular nanostructures that resemble tubes ob - served in vivo with biological membranes . Here , we studied membrane tube pulling in ternary mixtures of sphingo - myelin , phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol . Two salient results emerged : the lipid composition is signiﬁcantly different in the tubes and in the vesicles ; tube ﬁssion is observed when phase separation is generated in the tubes . This shows that lipid sorting may depend critically on both membrane curvature and phase separation . Phase separa - tion also appears to be important for membrane ﬁssion in tubes pulled out of giant liposomes or puriﬁed Golgi membranes .

During budding , sorting occurs , some lipids being incorporated into transport inter - mediates while others are being excluded ( Brugger et al , 2000 ; van Meer and Lisman , 2002 ) . In vitro experiments using dioleylphosphatidylcholine ( DOPC ) , cholesterol ( Chol ) and sphingomyelin ( SM ) reveal under appropriate condi - tions the coexistence of two types of ﬂuid membrane organi - zation called liquid - ordered L o and liquid - disordered L d phases ( Dietrich et al , 2001 ) . The composition of L o and L d phases is different : compared to the global average composi - tion , L o is enriched in SM whereas L d is enriched in DOPC ( Edidin , 2003 ) . Thus , the ability of L o versus L d phases to bud could be a critical parameter in sorting ; transport intermedi - ates may form from a pre - existing lipid domain on the donor membrane ( van Meer and Lisman , 2002 ) . This possibility adds up to two already proposed mechanisms : sorting according to molecular shape ( Mukherjee et al , 1999 ) and dynamical sorting ( Mukherjee and Maxﬁeld , 2000 ) . Depending on their physical state ( L o versus L d ) , membranes display different capabilities to curve . As a result , domains coexisting on the same vesicle exhibit different curvatures ( Julicher and Lipowsky , 1993 ; Baumgart et al , 2003 ) . Conversely , membrane curvature is expected to induce phase separation in multicomponent membranes ( Leibler and Andelman , 1987 ; Seifert , 1993 ) . Another important event in transport is ﬁssion of transport intermediates from donor membranes . Evidence exists that ﬁssion is directly linked to changes in composition of the lipid bilayer , suggest - ing that the physical properties of lipids play a direct role in the ﬁssion process ( Schmidt et al , 1999 ; Huttner and Schmidt , 2000 ) . We have recently developed an experimental system that allows the formation of very thin membrane tubes with a diameter of several tens of nanometers . Such tubes are pulled from giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) made of either controlled phospholipidic membrane or of biological mem - branes , by the action of molecular motors ( kinesins ) moving along microtubules ( Roux et al , 2002 ) . This assay makes the comparison with in vivo trafﬁcking events reliable , as the tubes generated have dimensions in the physiological range of sizes of transport intermediates , much smaller than the few micron size buds obtained in some cases with giant vesicles ( Baumgart et al , 2003 ) . Here , we used this assay to test the ability of L o and L d phases to form membrane tubes and to investigate the dynamic sorting of lipids during tube formation and the stability of tubes upon phase separation . Results and discussion Phase diagram of brain sphingomyelin / cholesterol / dioleylphosphatidylcholine vesicles GUVs were prepared from mixtures of brain sphingomyelin ( BSM ) , Chol and DOPC ; they were ﬂuorescently labeled by incorporation of a ﬂuorescent lipid BODIPY FL - C 5 - hexadeca - noyl phosphatidylcholine ( BODIPY FL - C 5 - HPC ) at a concentra - tion of 0 . 5 % mol / mol . A total of 11 different compositions of BSM : Chol : DOPC mixtures were tested for the preparation of GUVs . As shown in Supplementary Figure S1A ( Supplementary data ) , the vesicles displayed domains of different phases corresponding to segregation of lipids to various degrees depending on the relative ratio of BSM , Chol and DOPC . Vesicles with a homogeneous ﬂuorescence , reﬂecting an absence of lipid segregation , were observed at molar ratios of 1 : 1 : 0 , 0 : 1 : 1 , 1 : 2 : 1 and 1 : 2 : 3 of BSM : Chol : DOPC , respectively . These values correspond to ‘high’ Chol content ( over 30 % ) . Vesicles with both highly and weakly ﬂuorescent domains of various sizes were observed at lower Chol concentrations ( molar ratios of 3 : 2 : 1 and 3 : 1 : 3 ) . In the absence of Chol , at molar ratios of 3 : 0 : 1 , 1 : 0 : 1 and 1 : 0 : 3 , Received : 17 January 2005 ; accepted : 25 February 2005 ; published online : 24 March 2005 * Corresponding author .

The ganglioside GM1 is known to speciﬁcally segregate into the L o phase enriched in SM ( Dietrich et al , 2001 ) . As shown in Figure 1A , BODIPY FL - C 5 - HPC and GM1 stained with ﬂuorescent cholera toxin ( which speciﬁcally binds to GM1 ) did not overlap in a segregated vesicle ( 3 : 1 : 3 ) . This observa - tion shows that BODIPY FL - C 5 - HPC was segregated into the L d phase . The ﬂuorescence ratio of BODIPY FL - C 5 - HPC between ﬂuorescent and nonﬂuorescent phases on equatorial con - focal planes of vesicles of various lipid compositions was found to decrease upon increase of Chol concentration ( Supplementary Figure S1B ) . This observation is compatible with the fact that Chol favors lipid mixing . In agreement with previous reports ( Veatch and Keller , 2002 ; Kahya et al , 2003 ) , the Chol concentration thus appeared critical for the forma - tion of lipid domains . We then constructed a schematic phase diagram from our data ( Figure 1B and Table I ) . The gray area corresponds to lipid compositions for which the GUVs exhibit phase separation . The 1 : 1 : 1 vesicles represent a frontier situation in which lipids can be segregated or not depending on small changes in Chol concentration . This phase diagram is in good agreement with results obtained with various techniques ( de Almeida et al , 2003 ; Kahya et al , 2003 ; Lawrence et al , 2003 ; Veatch and Keller , 2003 ) . Induction of phase separation GUVs made of the 1 : 1 : 1 lipid mixture showed particular properties . The majority exhibited a uniform ﬂuorescence phase . Without excluding the possibility that small nano - domains of L o phase , below the optical resolution , exist ( Lawrence et al , 2003 ) , this suggests that lipids are in one phase ( L d ) on these GUVs . However , the others ( 10 – 30 % of the population ) showed a ﬂuorescent domain covering only one hemisphere ( Supplementary Figure S1A ) . Interestingly , ﬂuorescence excitation of homogeneous vesicles led to the progressive appearance of small nonﬂuorescent domains that rapidly fused together ( Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure S1A ) . Similar observations were made with 3 : 4 : 1 mixtures ( data not shown ) . As the kinetics of domain formation was dependent on light intensity , two conditions ( described in Materials and methods ) were used to generate domains , one leading to domain appearance within 1 s ( ‘strong’ induction ) and the other within 10 s ( ‘weak’ induction ) . Homogeneous vesicles of other lipid compositions did not form domains under the same conditions , as shown in Figure 1C , for a 0 : 1 : 1 mixture . This suggests that for compositions very close to the phase transition ( such as 1 : 1 : 1 and 3 : 4 : 1 lipid mixtures ) , very small changes in lipid concentration can induce phase se - paration . Indeed , photoactivation of 1 : 1 : 1 vesicles generated small amount of oxidized Chol , as shown by thin - layer chromatography ( TLC ; Supplementary Figure S2A and Supplementary data ) . About 10 times more oxidized Chol was generated after strong induction as compared to weak induction ( Supplementary Figure S2C ) . In addition , incor - poration of Chol ( 6 % n / n ) to photoactivated lipid mixtures led to the formation of homogeneous GUVs , which were again sensitive to photoactivation ( Supplementary Figure S2B ) . The above results suggest that photoactivation causes the depletion of Chol , and that a small decrease in the Chol content of 1 : 1 : 1 GUVs is sufﬁcient to promote phase separa - tion . To test this hypothesis directly , 1 : 1 : 1 GUVs were incubated with the Chol - sequestering agent methyl - b - cyclo - dextrin ( M b CD ) ( Kilsdonk et al , 1995 ) . As illustrated in Figure 1 Phase separation in GUVs . ( A ) Segregation of BODIPY FL - C 5 - HPC and GM1 - ganglioside in a 3 : 1 : 3 GUV .

( C ) Induction of phase separa - tion of lipids by strong photoactivation . Vesicles made of only DOPC and Chol ( 0 : 1 : 1 ) do not exhibit formation of domains under photoactivation . In contrast , photoactivation of GUVs made of BSM , Chol and DOPC ( 1 : 1 : 1 ) induces the apparition of small domains that rapidly fuse together . Photoactivation had no effect when lipids were segregated by incubation of GUVs in the presence of 10mM M b CD . Time is in seconds . Bars , 10 m m .

Additionally , M b CD did not induce phase separation on homogeneous vesicles of other lipid compositions ( 1 : 1 : 0 , 0 : 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 : 3 ) , except for the 1 : 2 : 1 mixture ( data not shown ) . Most likely , M b CD removes more Chol from membranes than photoactivation ( about 20 % , as estimated using the phase diagram described above ) , explaining why 1 : 2 : 1 vesicles do not form domains upon photoactivation ( data not shown ) . Two different mechanisms for lipid sorting Membrane tubes were then pulled out of GUVs prepared from various lipid mixtures . The force f required to pull tubes is proportional to the square root of the bending rigidity k and of the membrane tension s : f ¼ 2 p ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2 ks p ( Derenyi et al , 2002 ) . Of note , this equation neglects the contribution of the nonlocal bending rigidity , which is due to the difference between inner and outer leaﬂet areas . Indeed , this effect becomes signiﬁcant only for tubes longer than several hun - dreds of microns and at a time scale of the order of 1min ( Svetina et al , 1998 ) , which is not the case under our experimental conditions . To our knowledge , no direct mea - surement of the bending rigidity of SM - rich L o phases has been reported so far . The measurement of the force f at ﬁxed tension was obtained using an optical tweezers setup coupled to a micropipette system ( see Materials and methods and Figure 2 ) . The force was measured at different tensions for the 1 : 1 : 0 ( Figure 2 ) and 0 : 1 : 1 compositions . For instance , at s ¼ 5 (cid:2) 10 (cid:3) 5 N / m , values of 36 7 5 and 21 7 5pN were mea - sured for 1 : 1 : 0 and 0 : 1 : 1 vesicles , respectively . From the plot of force f versus ﬃﬃﬃﬃ s p , we deduced the corresponding bending rigidities : 31 7 2 (cid:2) 10 (cid:3) 20 J ( 65 7 6kT ) and 12 7 1 . 2 (cid:2) 10 (cid:3) 20 J ( 30 7 3kT ) for 1 : 1 : 0 and 0 : 1 : 1 compositions , respectively ( Figure 3A ) . Thus , 1 : 1 : 0 membranes ( L o phase ) are about 2 . 2 times more rigid than 0 : 1 : 1 membranes ( L d phase ) , in relative good agreement with the values deduced from the shape analysis of buds in segregated vesicles ( Baumgart et al , 2003 ) . Consequently , for the same tension , the radius of 0 : 1 : 1 tubes ( L d phase ) should be about 1 . 5 times smaller than that of 1 : 1 : 0 tubes ( L 0 phase ) , as R ¼ ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ k = 2 s p ( Derenyi et al , 2002 ) . Note that for s ¼ 5 (cid:2) 10 (cid:3) 5 N / m , the diameters of the tube in L d and L o phases are expected to be equal to 70 and 110nm , respectively . However , these values are below the optical resolution and cannot be measured accurately with our optical tweezers setup under controlled membrane tension . From the above data , we expected that molecular motors should preferentially pull tubes out of the L d phase in Table I Summary of the effects of photoactivation on phase separation and tube ﬁssion for different compositions CompositionBSM : Chol : DOPC State Phase separation induced by light Phase separation induced by M b CD % Tubes connected to ﬂuorescent phase % Fission under strong illumination % Fission under weak illumination 0 : 1 : 1 NS No No — 0 0 1 : 1 : 0 NS No No — 0 0 1 : 2 : 3 NS No No — 0 0 1 : 2 : 1 NS No Yes — 0 0 1 : 1 : 1 NS / S Yes Yes Seg 100 88 0 3 : 4 : 1 NS / S Yes Yes — 87 0 3 : 2 : 1 S No ND 57 . 7 0 0 3 : 1 : 3 S No ND 100 0 0 NS : nonsegregated ; S : segregated ; ND : not determined .

Curvature - induced lipid sorting and membrane ﬁssion A Roux et al & 2005 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 24 | NO 8 | 2005 1539 segregated vesicles since the force required is lower . This was experimentally veriﬁed in our assay upon observation of tubes pulled by kinesins using fast 3D video microscopy ( Savino et al , 2001 ) . Biotinylated lipid used to anchor kine - sins to membrane being equally distributed within the L d and L o phases ( illustrated in Figure 3B for 3 : 1 : 3 GUVs ) , motors are able to pull on both phases . However , in segregated vesicles labeled with BODIPY FL - C 5 - HPC , the majority of the tubes were not only ﬂuorescent but also connected to the ﬂuorescent domains ( Figure 3C ) . This suggests that tubes were essentially composed of membranes in L d phase en - riched in DOPC . We further checked that GM1 , which segre - gates speciﬁcally into the L o phase , was indeed essentially excluded from tubes ( Figure 3D ) . For 3 : 1 : 3 , 1 : 0 : 3 , 1 : 0 : 1 and the segregated subpopulation of 1 : 1 : 1 , 90 – 100 % of the tubes were in the L d phase . Even in the case of 3 : 2 : 1 mixture , which led to a high proportion of L o phase ( between 2 / 3 and 3 / 4 ; see Supplementary Figure S1 ) , this proportion was still of the order of 50 % ( Figure 3C ) . Taken together , these data indicate that the bending rigidity of the L o phase does not favor the formation of highly curved structures in the diameter range of physiological transport intermediates such as endosomal and Golgi tubules . Thus , differences in the ability of phases to form curved structures can lead to lipid sorting . Importantly , sorting between ﬂuorescent lipids used as markers also occurred in tubes grown from nonsegregated vesicles . Direct evidence came from the comparison of GM1 ( labeled by Cy3 - cholera toxin ) and BODIPY FL - C 5 - HPC amounts present in tubes and in vesicles , as shown in Figures 4A and B . Tubes were pulled out of homogeneous 1 : 1 : 1 vesicles containing 1 % GM1 ( labeled by Cy3 - cholera toxin ) and 0 . 5 % BODIPY FL - C 5 - HPC . The ﬂuorescence ratio between BODIPY FL - C 5 - HPC and GM1 was increased in the tube as compared to the donor vesicle ( Figure 4B ) . Even though important per se , this result could very well concern the ﬂuorescent lipids only . The following observation shows that this is more general and concerns the nonﬂuorescent lipids as well . We pulled tubes out of homogeneous vesicles Figure 3 Lipid sorting in tubes pulled out of ‘segregated’ vesicles . ( A ) Linear variation of the force f required to extend a tube from a vesicle in the L 0 phase ( 1 : 1 : 0 ) ( squares ) and in the L d phase ( 0 : 1 : 1 ) ( circles ) as a function of the square root of the membrane tension ﬃﬃﬃﬃ s p : The experiments were performed on seven ( squares ) and 11 ( circles ) vesicles , as described in the text .

( D ) Tubes pulled out of a ‘segregated’ vesicle ( 3 : 1 : 3 mixture ) labeled with both BODIPY FL - C 5 - HPC ( BOD FL - HPC ) ( green ) and ﬂuorescent cholera toxin - GM1 complex ( red ) . Tubes appear green and connected to the green domain ( arrows ) . They are thus in the L d phase . White ﬂuorescent spots are bead aggregates , which do not interfere with the experiment .

Curvature - induced lipid sorting and membrane ﬁssion A Roux et al The EMBO Journal VOL 24 | NO 8 | 2005 & 2005 European Molecular Biology Organization 1540 made of 1 : 1 : 1 mixtures . If no lipid sorting was at work , subsequent photoactivation should trigger phase separation in the tubes at lower intensities than in the vesicle . Indeed , in a tube , the phase separation instability is more easily attained due to its coupling to the pearling instability ( Derenyi et al , 2004 ) . This was not the case . Under weak illumination , the vesicles showed phase separation whereas tubes did not ( Figure 4C ) . Only under strong illumination did the tube show phase separation visualized by the appearance of small weakly ﬂuorescent domains ( Figure 4C ) . This event led to tube ﬁssion as described in the next section . This shows that the lipid composition was not the same in the tube and in the vesicle . The further observation that with BODIPY FL - C 5 - HPC labeling , the nonﬂuorescent phase repre - sented only about 10 % of the tube area as compared to 50 % in the GUV ( Figure 4C ) shows that sorting was efﬁcient . Since the nonﬂuorescent L o phase is richer in Chol and BSM than the ﬂuorescent L d phases ( de Almeida et al , 2003 ) , this observation implies that tubes are depleted of both Chol and BSM . We have thus evidenced that sorting of lipids in tubes can be achieved in two ways : in the ﬁrst way , phase separation has already occurred on the vesicle and tubes are enriched in lipids of one phase ; in the second way , lipids are initially mixed in the membrane and are subsequently sorted upon tube formation on the basis of their molecular proper - ties . This second mechanism is due to the change in bending Figure 4 Lipid sorting in tubes pulled out of homogeneous vesicles ( 1 : 1 : 1 mixture ) . ( A ) Confocal images of tubes pulled out of membranes labeled with BODIPY FL - C 5 - HPC lipids ( BOD FL - HPC ) and Cy3 - cholera toxin – GM1 complexes ( GM1 ) . Images were recorded at two levels : one at the vesicle equator ( vesicle image ) and one on the substrate ( tube image ) ( for more details , see Supplementary data ) . Left ﬂuorescence image corresponds to the BOD FL - HPC channel , whereas the right image to the GM1 channel . Tube images show that the ( BOD FL - HPC ) intensity is higher than that of Cy3 - cholera toxin ( GM1 ) , whereas it is the opposite in the vesicle image ( see insets ) . Fluorescence intensities of BOD FL - HPC and GM1 respectively in the tubes ( I Bt , I Gt ) and in the vesicle ( I Bv , I Gv ) were measured from tube and vesicle images ( see Materials and methods ) . Highly ﬂuorescent dots on the vesicle images correspond to the connection between the tubes and the vesicle . Bar , 10 m m . ( B ) The ﬂuorescence ratio FR ¼ ( I Bt / I Gt ) / ( I Bv / I Gv ) was calculated for each network . Two compositions were tested : 0 : 1 : 1 and 1 : 1 : 1 . For 0 : 1 : 1 ( L d phase ) , the vesicles contained two L d phase ﬂuorophores ( BOD FL - HPC and TRITC - DHPE ) as a control experiment ; the FR histogram ( blue ) calculated from 30 different networks was centered on the value 1 , indicating that no relative sorting occurs under these conditions . For 1 : 1 : 1 , vesicles contained 1 % GM1 and 0 . 5 % BOD FL - HPC ; FR histogram ( red ) shows that values obtained from 30 different networks were always superior to 1 , reﬂecting a relative depletion of GM1 in tubes or equivalently a relative enrichment in BOD FL - HPC . ( C ) Tubes pulled out of homogeneous vesicles ( 1 : 1 : 1 mixture ) during phase separation by weak and strong photoactivation . Under weak photoactivation , no phase separation is observable along the tubes even after 75s of constant illumination , whereas the vesicle has reached a complete segregation ( the arrow points to the L o domain ) . Under strong photoactivation , very small weakly ﬂuorescent domains appear on tubes ( see medium size arrows ) , leading to ﬁssion ( big arrows ) . The vesicle is segregated after 5s of constant illumination ( small arrows point to L o domains ) . The enlarged area showing tubes is delimited in the last picture . Note the downscaling of the ﬂuorescence intensities in the tubes compared to those present in the vesicles , due to the small number of ﬂuorescent molecules in a nanometer size tube . Bars , 10 m m .

It is important to note that because both ways of sorting are only dependent on differences in the bending rigidities of different lipid compositions , they both depend on membrane curvature of the studied structures , and thus on their size . We show here that in the range of sizes of intracellular transport intermediates ( tens of nm ) , these two ways of lipid sorting occur , and thus are likely to take place in cells . Phase separation induces membrane ﬁssion We have furthermore observed that the induction of phase separation on tubes pulled out of 1 : 1 : 1 and 3 : 4 : 1 homo - geneous GUVs provoked numerous ﬁssion events ( Figures Figure 5 Phase separation induces tube ﬁssion . ( A ) Strong photoactivation of tubes growing from 1 : 1 : 1 vesicles leads to tube ﬁssion . Fission events ( large arrows ) occurred predominantly at the sites of formation of weakly ﬂuorescent domains resulting from phase separation ( small arrows ) ( see also movie Figure 4A and movie S1 in Supplementary data ) . Numbers in the images A , B and C correspond to time in seconds . Bar , 10 m m .

With the 3 : 4 : 1 composition , more than 90 % of the ﬁssion events occurred exactly at the boundary between L o and L d domains ( Figure 5B , arrow ) . With the 1 : 1 : 1 composi - tion , the precise position where ﬁssion occurs was difﬁcult to determine due to the small size and the low ﬂuorescence of the L o domains in this case ( movie 5A , Supplementary data ) . Over 80 % of the networks grown from 1 : 1 : 1 and 3 : 4 : 1 vesicles showed at least one ﬁssion event ( Figure 5D ) . In Figure 5A , we can observe three ﬁssion events . The last two can be clearly related to phase separation ( movie Figure 5A , Supplementary data ) . Figure 5B is particularly illuminating . At 4s after photoactivation , a small domain of L d phase appeared at the tip of the tube . It is characterized both by an intense ﬂuorescence and a tube diameter smaller than that of the initial tube . About 20s later , the tube broke at the limit between the strongly and the weakly ﬂuorescent domains . This led to the formation of an almost spherical vesicle . In some cases , the ﬁssion process led to complete fragmentation of the tubes into vesicles ( movie S1 , Supplementary data ) . The time required for tube ﬁssion after domain formation was observed to rank statistically between less than 100ms and more than 10s depending on lipid composition . These ob - servations are consistent with a theoretical analysis in which rupture originates both from line tension at the domain interfaces and Gaussian curvature discontinuity ( Allain et al , 2004 ) . No ﬁssion events were observed for tubes where photo - activation did not induce the formation of domains in the tubes ( 0 : 1 : 1 , 1 : 1 : 0 , 1 : 2 : 3 , 1 : 2 : 1 , 3 : 1 : 3 or 3 : 2 : 1—for the ﬁrst four concentrations , vesicles were homogeneous , and for the last two , domains existed in the vesicles but not in the tubes ) ( Figure 5D ) . The above data thus reveal a direct link between phase separation along membrane tubes and ﬁssion . Note that this phase separation involves two liquid phases since the shape of the domains on vesicles was circular ( Supplementary Figure S1A ) . In good agreement with the photoactivation experiments , tube ﬁssion events were also observed after injection of M b CD . Figure 5C illustrates an experiment showing that the addition of M b CD to tubes grown out of homogeneous 1 : 1 : 1 GUVs induced two ﬁssion events ( see movie Figure 5C ) . No ﬁssion events were observed when M b CD was added to tubes growing from vesicles remaining homogeneous ( 0 : 1 : 1 and 1 : 1 : 0 ) ( Figure 5E ) . A tentative hypothesis is that this is also true for biological membranes . In order to test this idea , we generated tube networks by binding kinesins to biotinylated Golgi mem - branes ( Roux et al , 2002 ) . Under control conditions , no obvious ﬁssion events could be observed . The addition of M b CD induced ﬁssion in a signiﬁcant proportion of networks ( Figure 5E ) . It is likely , as observed for model membranes , that the decrease in Chol favors phase separation of lipids present in Golgi - derived membrane tubes , and leads to their ﬁssion . This strongly supports the relevance of our in vitro experiments to biological systems . A similar link between phase separation and budding has already been established experimentally ( Dobereiner et al , 1993 ; Baumgart et al , 2003 ) and discussed theoretically ( Julicher and Lipowsky , 1993 ; Chen et al , 1997 ) . Our experi - ments conﬁrm and extend these ﬁndings . Indeed , the tension values in our experiments are such that no budding is observed on vesicles , whereas tube ﬁssion is obtained . This is an important difference between the two experimental situations : tension prevents ﬁssion of buds in vesicles but promotes tube ﬁssion . As in the vesicle case , line tension between two coexisting phases promotes tube breakage ( Allain et al , 2004 ) but tension enhances the effect by reducing the tube diameter . It is a characteristic of many systems in biology to work in the vicinity of a phase transition in order to increase their sensitivity ( Duke and Bray , 1999 ; Camalet et al , 2000 ; Eguiluz et al , 2000 ) . Such proximity was speculated early for mem - branes , but without reference to intracellular transport ( Overath et al , 1970 ; Wisnieski et al , 1974 ; Bloom et al , 1991 ) . Our results suggest a clear biological function : one of the main roles of the numerous proteins implicated in sorting and ﬁssion events ( Slepnev and De Camilli , 2000 ) could then be to trigger phase separation of membrane lipids , either by clustering speciﬁc lipids or by inducing membrane tubula - tion . Proteins ( e . g . dynamin ) might locally change the lipid composition in order to induce a phase separation that will promote the local ﬁssion of the membrane . Materials and methods Reagents Lipids ( BSM , DOPC , Chol and N - Cap - biotinyl - dioleyl - phosphoetha - nolamine ( Biot - Cap - DOPE ) ) and brain ovine GM1 ( asialo - GM1 - ganglioside ) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids . BODIPY FL - C 5 - hexadecanoyl phosphatidylcholine , NBD - C 5 - hexadecanoyl phosphatidylcholine and N - ( 6 - tetramethylrhodaminethiocarbamoyl ) - 1 , 2 - dihexadecanoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine ( TRITC - DHPE ) were obtained from Molecular Probes . All chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich , except ATP and GTP , which were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals . Streptavidin beads ( 100nm ) were purchased from Bangs Laboratories ( Carmel , IN ) . Biotinylated hemagglutinin - kinesin ( a gift of F Ne´de´lec , EMBL , Heidelberg ) was puriﬁed as described previously ( Surrey et al , 1998 ) . Cholera toxin was obtained from Sigma and labeled using the Cy3 - labeling kit from Amersham . Giant unilamellar vesicles GUVs were grown using the electroformation technique ( Angelova et al , 1992 ) at 50 1 C , over the melting temperature of SM . To make lipid mixtures , BSM ( average MW 731g ) and DOPC ( MW 785g ) were considered to have the same molecular weight and Chol ( MW 386g ) half of it . As the incorporation of 1 % GM1 led to segregation of 1 : 1 : 1 vesicles , 3 % Chol had to be added to restore ﬂuorescence homogeneity . GM1 localization was detected by adding 3 m g / ml Cy3 - cholera toxin to the mixture , which binds to GM1 . Phase separation induced by photoactivation Two illumination conditions were used : fast phase separation was obtained using an HBO 100W mercury lamp mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope , on vesicles containing only 0 . 5 % of the BODIPY FL - C 5 - HPC probe . The lamp was used at 50 % of its maximal intensity with an excitation ﬁlter at 525nm , generating a light intensity of 3 . 5mW ( exit of the objective (cid:2) 100 ( numerical aperture ( NA ) 1 . 4 , Plan Apochromat , Zeiss ) ) , and 100 images were acquired using a CoolSNAP HQ camera ( Princeton Instruments ) , 100ms each , leading to 10s of intense photoactivation . Under these conditions , phase separation occurred within a second and led to ﬁssion of tubes after several seconds ( strong photoactivation ) . Under the 3D fast microscope , a low light intensity ( 10 m W , exit of the objective ) at GFP excitation wavelength ( 510nm ) and 1 % of ﬂuorescent marker ( because 0 . 5 % did not lead to phase separation , as less oxidized Chol was generated under these illumination conditions ) allowed phase separation to occur within 10s ( weak photoactivation ) . Thin - layer chromatography analysis A 1mg portion of 1 : 1 : 1 BSM - Chol - DOPC containing 1 % of BODIPY FL - C 5 - HPC was resuspended in 0 . 5ml of water by vortexing for several minutes . Small unilamellar vesicles ( SUVs ) were formed Curvature - induced lipid sorting and membrane ﬁssion A Roux et al & 2005 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 24 | NO 8 | 2005 1543 by continuous sonication for 3 – 4min . SUVs were then photo - activated by placing the eppendorf tube in a laser beam ( 250 , 25 or 0 . 6mW ) at 514nm for 2h . The intensity of the laser used in Supplementary Figure S2A was 250mW ( maximum ) . The suspen - sion was dried in a speedvac after transfer to a glass tube , and traces of water were removed by placing the tube overnight in a vacuum chamber . Then , lipids were resuspended in CHCl 3 , and analyzed on TLC silica plates ( WHATMAN AL SIL G / UV , cat no . 4420222 ) . To separate properly different sterols , a mixture of 95 % chloroform and 5 % acetone was used . With this eluent , glycerolipids and sphingolipids do not migrate . Sterols were revealed by 10 % phosphotungstic acid in 90 % ethanol and heating the plate at 90 1 C in an oven for 15min . Quantities could not be accurately measured with this chemical reaction , but about twice less oxidized Chol was found at 25mW than at 250mW , and more then 10 times less at 0 . 6mW . 3D fast microscopy A setup developed at the Curie Institute was used and has been previously described by Savino et al ( 2001 ) . It consisted of a Leica DM RXA microscope equipped with a piezoelectric translator ( PI - FOC ; Physik Instrumente , Waldbron , Germany ) placed at the base of a (cid:2) 100 Plan Apochromat ( NA 1 . 4 ; Leica ) . No deconvolution process was used . For each tube network , six stacks of 80 – 100 images were acquired every 15s , each image being taken every 0 . 3 m m by a CoolSNAP HQ camera ( Princeton Instruments ) . Each image was acquired for 50 – 70ms . Measurement of bending rigidity The force f required to pull a homogeneous tube depends on the bending rigidity k and the tension s of the membrane : f ¼ 2 p ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ 2 ks p : Thus , the bending rigidity can be deduced directly from the force measurement during the tube extension , with a ﬁxed membrane tension . This was achieved by combining an optical tweezers setup with a micropipette technique . Light from a solid - state , diode - pumped Nd : YAG laser ( 1064nm , 2 . 5W , continuous wave , Coherent ) was focused , using a (cid:2) 100 / 1 . 3 NA oil immersion objective ( Axiovert 200 ; Zeiss ) , to construct a single - beam optical trap . The X – Y – Z position of the trapping zone in the microscope was controlled by means of external optics . Video images of the captured beads ( streptavidin polystyrene particles , radius R ¼ 1 . 76 m m ) were recorded and analyzed off - line using a custom - made tracking software ( provided by Konstantin Zeldo - vitch , Curie Institute ) with a temporal resolution of 40ms and a subpixel spatial resolution of 35nm . The trapping stiffness , k f , was calibrated by measuring the ﬂuctuations of a captured bead for incident laser powers lower than 200mW ( k f ¼ k B T / / D x 2 S ) and against Stokes’ drag force for laser powers higher than 200mW ( k f D x ¼ 6 pZ Rv , where D x is the displacement of the bead in the trap , Z is the water viscosity and v is the velocity of the moving chamber ) . From these two methods , the stiffness of the tweezers was found to be of the order of 0 . 12 7 0 . 01pN / nm / W . The micropipette technique is classically used ( Evans and Rawicz , 1990 ) for ﬁxing the tension in a GUV . A micropipette of typically 4 m m diameter at the tip is connected to a mobile water reservoir on one end , and aspirates the GUV on the other . The hydrostatic pressure D P ﬁxes the membrane tension ; it is controlled by the vertical position of the water reservoir . In fact , using Laplace’s law , it can easily be shown that s ¼ D P : R pip 2 ð 1 (cid:3) R pip = R ves Þ where R pip is the pipette radius and R ves the vesicle radius ( Evans and Rawicz , 1990 ) . This micropipette can be moved in X and Z directions by micrometric displacements and in the Y direction parallel to the pipette axis by a piezoelectric stage ( Physik Instrumente , Waldbron , Germany ) . To insure adhesion to a 3 . 5 m m streptavidin - coated bead , 0 . 005 % ( n / n ) DOPE - PEG2000 - biotin was added to the lipid mixture . The GUV held by the micropipette was pressed against the bead for about 1s , and then retracted at 0 . 2 m m / s . The bead position was simultaneously recorded . Assay for tube formation Membrane tubes were pulled out of GUVs and Golgi membranes as previously described ( Roux et al , 2002 ) . Brieﬂy , biotinylated kinesins were bound to biotinylated lipids incorporated in membrane via nonﬂuorescent 100nm streptavidin beads . Kinesin - coated beads and GUVs were sequentially injected in a 25 m l observation chamber coated with taxol - polymerized microtubules and containing 1mM ATP . All the experiments were performed at room temperature , typically 22 1 C . Enriched rat liver Golgi membranes were puriﬁed according to standard procedure ( Slusar - ewicz et al , 1994 ) . Tubes were observed either by video enhanced differential interference contrast ( VE - DIC ) or by ﬂuorescence microscopy ( Roux et al , 2002 ) . Fluorescence intensity measurement For each network , two 12 - bit images were acquired at two different Z positions using confocal microscopy . Tube and vesicle images were acquired at the substrate and equatorial plane of the vesicle , respectively ( see Figure 3A ) . The quantitative analysis was performed using ImageJ freeware ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij ) . The tube and the vesicle intensities were deduced from the maximum intensity of a rectangular section perpendicular to the tube axis in the tube image and perpendicular to the membrane in the vesicle image , respectively . I Gt and I Gv represent the intensities in the tubes and in the vesicles of the ﬂuorescent complex GM1 / Cy3 - cholera toxin , respectively . Similarly , I Bt and I Bv are the intensities in the tubes and vesicles of BODIPY FL - C 5 - HPC , respectively . The ﬂuores - cence ratio FR ¼ ( I Bt / I Gt ) / ( I Bv / I Gv ) was calculated for each network . Values superior to 1 correspond to a relative enrichment in the tube of BODIPY FL - C 5 - HPC , whereas values inferior to 1 would corre - spond to enrichment of the GM1 / Cy3 - cholera toxin complex . No relative sorting of the ﬂuorophores corresponds to a value of 1 . Supplementary data Supplementary data are available at The EMBO Journal Online .
