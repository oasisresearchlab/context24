Despite years of research , the role of this signaling in integrin activation and focal adhesion assembly is unclear . We provide evidence that the Src - family kinase ( SFK ) substrate Cas ( Crk - associated substrate , p130Cas , BCAR1 ) is phosphorylated , and associated with its effectors , Crk / CrkL , in clusters that are precursors of focal adhesions . The initial phospho - Cas clusters contain integrin  1 in its inactive , bent closed , conformation . Later , phospho - Cas and total Cas levels decrease as integrin  1 is activated and core focal adhesion proteins including vinculin , talin , kindlin and paxillin are recruited . Cas is required for cell spreading and focal adhesion assembly in epithelial and fibroblast cells on collagen and fibronectin . Cas cluster formation requires Cas , Crk / CrkL , SFKs and Rac1 but not vinculin . Rac1 provides positive feedback onto Cas through reactive oxygen , opposed by negative feedback from the ubiquitin proteasome system . The results suggest a two - step model for focal adhesion assembly in which clusters of phospho - Cas , effectors and inactive integrin  1 grow through positive feedback prior to integrin activation and recruitment of core focal adhesion proteins . 2 Introduction Cell migration on extracellular matrix ( ECM ) involves the repeated assembly and disassembly of integrin - mediated cell - ECM adhesions ( Hynes 2002 ) . Integrins are heterodimers of  and  chains that can switch between inactive and active conformations . Integrin activation exposes binding sites for ECM outside the cell and for specific integrin - tail - binding proteins inside the cell . The latter can associate with other proteins to form focal adhesions that link integrins to the actin cytoskeleton , providing traction forces for actomyosin - driven cell movement ( Iwamoto et al . , 2015 , Kanchanawong et al . , 2022 , Moser et al . , 2009 ) . At the ultrastructural level , focal adhesions are heterogeneous , with nanoclusters of active integrins and integrin tail - associated proteins closest to the membrane , F - actin and actin - associated proteins on top , and mechanosensing force transducers sandwiched between ( Kanchanawong et al . , 2010 , Legerstee et al . , 2021 ) . Forces generated by actin polymerization and actomyosin contractility partially unfold the force transducers , exposing binding sites for other focal adhesion proteins and stabilizing the structure ( Wolfenson et al . , 2019 ) . For example , talin is a conformationally sensitive protein that binds integrin through its head domain and actin through sites in its tail . Tension between the talin head and tail regions exposes binding sites for vinculin and other structural and regulatory proteins ( Bachmann et al . , 2023 ) . In turn , binding to talin exposes actin - binding sites on vinculin , building links between integrins and actin filaments , providing resistance to contractile forces and anchorage for cell movement . Even though these mechanical principles are well understood , it is unclear whether they explain the early stages of adhesion assembly , when integrin clusters may be too small to develop sufficient force and where inside - out signaling , membrane lipid microdomains , the glycocalyx , and actin polymerization may also be important ( Coyer et al . , 2012 , Henning Stumpf et al . , 2020 ) . In addition to binding ECM and focal adhesion proteins , integrins are also signaling centers , transducing biochemical signals . Cell adhesion , or integrin clustering with antibodies or beads coated with ECM , rapidly activates Src - family tyrosine kinases ( SFKs ) and focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) , leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of several integrin - associated proteins and activating the GTPase Rac1 ( Burridge et al . , 1996 , Parsons et al . , 2010 ) . These signaling events are clearly important for regulating cell motility , cell cycle and cell survival , but their roles in focal adhesion dynamics remain unclear ( Burridge et al . , 1996 , Mitra et al . , 2006 ) . 3 One of the main substrates for integrin - stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation is an adaptor protein named Cas ( p130Cas or BCAR1 ) ( Chodniewicz et al . , 2004 , Janostiak et al . , 2014b , Mitra et al . , 2006 ) . At the molecular level , Cas contains an N - terminal SH3 domain , a four - helix bundle , and a C - terminal FAT domain , separated by unstructured regions and an SFK SH3 / SH2 - binding site . Cas localizes to focal adhesions through its SH3 and FAT domains ( Donato et al . , 2010 , Nakamoto et al . , 1997 ) , which bind vinculin , FAK and paxillin in vitro ( Janostiak et al . , 2014a , Polte et al . , 1995 , Zhang et al . , 2017 ) . Cas and SFKs mutually activate each other , with Cas binding to and activating SFKs and SFKs phosphorylating Cas at up to 15 repeated YxxP motifs in the “substrate domain” ( SD ) between the SH3 domain and four - helix bundle ( Chodniewicz et al . , 2004 , Pellicena et al . , 2001 ) . The Cas SD is also phosphorylated rapidly during cell adhesion ( Miyamoto et al . , 1995 , Petch et al . , 1995 , Vuori et al . , 1995 ) . The trigger for Cas phosphorylation is unclear : integrin clustering or conformation changes or protein binding to the Cas SD may be involved ( Arias - Salgado et al . , 2003 , Hotta et al . , 2014 , Sawada et al . , 2006 ) . After phosphorylation , the pYxxP motifs can bind specific SH2 - domain proteins including the paralogs Crk and CrkL . Crk / CrkL in turn can bind to and stimulate various proteins , including the Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) DOCK180 ( Chodniewicz et al . , 2004 , Gotoh et al . , 1995 , Hasegawa et al . , 1996 , Klemke et al . , 1998 , Knudsen et al . , 1994 , Tanaka et al . , 1994 ) . DOCK180 can then activate Rac1 . Rac1 promotes actin polymerization and lamellipodial protrusion through the WAVE / Arp2 / 3 complex , and induces focal complex formation through unknown mechanisms ( Nobes et al . , 1995 , Stradal et al . , 2004 , Zaidel - Bar et al . , 2003 ) . Cas activity in focal adhesions is limited by the ubiquitin - proteasome system , which targets phosphorylated Cas for ubiquitination and degradation ( Steenkiste et al . , 2021 , Teckchandani et al . , 2016 , Teckchandani et al . , 2014 ) . The role of integrin - activated tyrosine phosphorylation in focal adhesion dynamics is unclear . Early studies of Cas knockout mouse embryo fibroblasts ( MEFs ) revealed defects in cell attachment and the actin cytoskeleton , suggesting that Cas may regulate adhesion assembly ( Honda et al . , 1999 , Honda et al . , 1998 ) . In addition , Cas regulates spreading and migration of Caco - 2 epithelial cells ( Sanders et al . , 2005 ) . However , other studies , using mutant MEFs lacking Cas , SFKs , FAK or paxillin , revealed no change in adhesion assembly but major 4 inhibition of adhesion disassembly ( Bockholt et al . , 1995 , Ilic et al . , 1995 , Webb et al . , 2004 ) . To revisit the role of Cas phosphorylation , we have studied focal adhesion assembly in spreading and migrating epithelial cells . Unexpectedly , we found that phosphorylated Cas co - clusters with inactive integrins nearly a minute before integrin activation and recruitment of core focal adhesion proteins . Cas is required for vinculin recruitment but vinculin is not required for Cas clusters to form . A positive - feedback loop between SFKs , Cas , Crk , Rac1 and reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) promotes the growth of the early Cas - integrin clusters and subsequent integrin activation and focal adhesion assembly , opposed by negative feedback from the ubiquitin - proteasome system . The results suggest a key role for SFK - Cas - Crk - Rac1 signaling in early stages of focal adhesion formation . 5 Results Cas clusters are precursors for vinculin clusters Cas has the potential to serve as a signaling hub that may be critical for focal adhesion assembly . However , we are only aware of one study where Cas recruitment kinetics were measured relative to other focal adhesion proteins . The results showed that Cas and paxillin are recruited simultaneously during adhesion assembly in migrating fibroblasts ( Donato et al . , 2010 ) . Another study using endothelial cells showed that tyrosine phosphorylation precedes paxillin recruitment ( Zaidel - Bar et al . , 2003 ) . These two studies suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation may start before Cas is recruited . However , the kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation , Cas recruitment and adhesion assembly may vary according to cell type , integrin , or ECM . Therefore , we evaluated the kinetics of Cas recruitment and tyrosine phosphorylation relative to focal adhesion assembly , making use of the immortalized , normal , mammary epithelial line MCF10A ( Debnath et al . , 2005 ) . Since Cas over - expression can stimulate cell migration ( Klemke et al . , 1998 , Yano et al . , 2000 ) , we tagged Cas by editing the Cas gene , inserting an artificial exon encoding mScarlet ( mSc ) and a linker sequence into the first intron and selecting a polyclonal population of mScarlet fluorescent cells ( Figure 1A , Figure 1 – figure supplement 1 ) . Western blotting revealed similar levels and phosphorylation of Cas and Cas mSc proteins , indicating that most cells are heterozygous ( Figure 1B ) . This intron tagging approach avoided the need for single - cell cloning that can select for variants ( see Methods ) . To monitor focal adhesions , the Cas mSc cells were transduced to express near - endogenous levels of YFP - tagged vinculin ( VCL ) . Imaging using total internal reflection ( TIRF ) microscopy revealed that Cas mSc and YFP - VCL substantially co - localized , as expected ( Figure 1C ) . Staining with Cas and vinculin antibodies revealed that tagging Cas and vinculin did not alter focal adhesion number or structure ( Figure 1 – figure supplement 2A - B ) . To compare Cas mSc and YFP - VCL dynamics , we performed dual - channel time - lapse TIRF imaging as cells attached and spread on collagen I ( COLI ) . Cas mSc formed clusters at the first points of cell - substrate contact and moved outwards with the spreading edge ( Figure 1D , Supplementary Video 1 ) . Vinculin joined these clusters later , and remained after Cas departed ( note transition from magenta to white to green in kymographs ) . Similar patterns of Cas and vinculin clustering were observed under spontaneous lamellipodial protrusions generated by 6 fully spread cells ( Figure 1E , Supplementary Video 2 ) . These results together suggest that Cas clusters are precursors of vinculin clusters during spreading and migration . To quantify the dynamics of cluster formation and avoid possible selection bias , we developed a computational pipeline to delineate regions of interest ( ROIs ) in which Cas , vinculin , or both Cas and vinculin intensities exceeded thresholds that were automatically set for each frame ( see Methods ) . ROIs were tracked over time and quantified if they exceeded 20 pixels ( 0 . 5  m 2 ) in area and persisted for three or more frames ( > 40 s ) ( Figure 1F , Supplementary Video 3 ) . These thresholds exclude the smallest , shortest - lived nascent adhesions but include larger focal complexes ( Kanchanawong et al . , 2022 ) . The mean intensity of each channel in each ROI was then quantified over the duration of the recording and the intensities smoothed and normalized to a range of 0 to 1 ( Figure 1 – figure supplement 3A ) . For each ROI , we defined  t 1 / 2 ( VCL - Cas ) as the time interval between Cas and vinculin reaching half - maximal intensity ( Figure 1 – figure supplement 3B ) . This metric showed wide variability in time interval across different ROIs in an individual cell . However , non - parametric analysis showed that the median  t 1 / 2 ( VCL - Cas ) was significantly greater than zero ( i . e . , Cas clustering preceded vinculin clustering ) ( median Δt 1 / 2 54 . 8 s , 95 % CI 23 - 105 s , for 90 ROIs in the cell shown ) ( Figure 1 – figure supplement 3C ) . Averaging the median time delay across multiple spreading cells in several experiments yielded a mean  t 1 / 2 ( VCL - Cas ) 43 . 8 + 3 s ( mean and SEM , n = 19 cells ) ( Figure 1G ) . Similar results were obtained quantifying Cas and vinculin intensities under lamellipodia generated by migrating cells ( Figure 1 – figure supplement 3D ) . Averaging the median time delay across multiple migrating cells in several experiments yielded a mean  t 1 / 2 ( VCL - Cas ) 68 . 5 + 7 s ( mean and SEM , n = 13 cells ) ( Figure 1H ) . A similar experiment using Cas mSc YFP - VCL HeLa cells also showed vinculin clustering after Cas ( median  t 1 / 2 ( VCL - Cas ) 48 . 1 + 9 s , mean and SEM , n = 13 cells ` ) ( Figure 1 – figure supplement 3E - F ) . Overall , these results show a strong tendency for Cas to form clusters at the edge of spreading or migrating epithelial cells , 45 - 60 s before vinculin recruitment . For comparison , the time interval between arrival of talin , vinculin and paxillin in nascent adhesions of CHO - K1 cells migrating on fibronectin is ~ 14 s or ~ 2 s for non - maturing or maturing adhesions respectively ( Han et al . , 2021 ) . The replacement of Cas clusters by vinculin clusters suggests that Cas may spatially 7 coordinate vinculin clustering and adhesion assembly in both spreading and migrating MCF10A and HeLa cells . Cas clusters are precursors of integrin clusters To determine when integrins cluster relative to Cas , we transduced MCF10A Cas mSc cells with a lentiviral vector encoding  1Ecto - pH , a recombinant integrin  1 with a pH - sensitive pHluorin tag inserted in the extracellular domain ( Huet - Calderwood et al . , 2017 ) . This integrin is cell - surface expressed , localizes to adhesions , exhibits normal integrin activation , and restores adhesion in integrin β1 knockout MEFs ( Huet - Calderwood et al . , 2017 ) . Live dual - color TIRF imaging of  1Ecto - pH in Cas mSc MCF10A cells revealed that  1Ecto - pH localized to Cas clusters , but , like YFP - VCL ,  1Ecto - pH kinetics were significantly delayed relative to Cas , with median  t 1 / 2 (  1 - Cas ) 57 . 7 + 6 . 7 s ( mean and SEM , n = 19 cells ) ( Figure 2A - C , Supplementary Video 4 left ) . As an independent approach to measure integrin clustering without ectopic expression , we tagged ITGB1 by inserting an artificial exon into the ITGB1 gene in HeLa Cas mSc cells , adding an optimized linker ( Parsons et al . , 2008 ) and GFP tag to the C - terminus ( Figure 2D , Figure 2 – figure supplement 1 ) . Western blotting showed a fusion protein of the expected mobility ( Figure 2D ) . Live imaging Cas mSc ITGB1 GFP cells revealed integrin clustering after Cas with median  t 1 / 2 ( ITGB1 - Cas ) 61 . 1 + 5 . 4 s ( mean and SEM , n = 15 cells ) ( Figure 2F - H , Supplementary Video 4 right ) . Thus , integrin  1 clusters about a minute after Cas in MCF10A and HeLa cells , at approximately the same time as vinculin . Initial Cas clusters contain Crk Tyrosine phosphorylation is the earliest event during nascent adhesion formation in migrating fibroblasts ( Zaidel - Bar et al . , 2003 ) . To determine when Cas is phosphorylated , we analyzed the recruitment of Crk , which binds to phosphorylated but not non - phosphorylated Cas and initiates downstream signaling ( Chodniewicz et al . , 2004 ) . We edited the CRK gene in Cas mSc HeLa cells , adding a linker and mGreenLantern ( mGL ) to the C terminus ( Figure 3A , Figure 3 – figure supplement 1 ) . Western blotting showed approximately equal expression of Crk mGL and Crk , suggesting most cells are heterozygous ( Figure 3B ) . Imaging Cas mSc Crk mGL cells during 8 attachment and spreading revealed rapid recruitment of Crk mGL on Cas mSc clusters ( Supplementary Video 5 left , Figure 3C - E ) . The median time delay ,  t 1 / 2 ( Crk - Cas ) , was 5 . 7 + 2 . 5 s ( mean and SEM , n = 21 cells ) ( Figure 3D ) , much shorter than the time for vinculin or integrin recruitment . Crk recruitment was significantly delayed by treatment with eCF506 , which inhibits all SFKs but not other kinases ( Fraser et al . , 2016 ) , indicating that Crk recruitment requires phosphorylation ( Figure 3E , Supplementary Video 5 right ) . Together these results suggest Cas is activated immediately as it first clusters , when integrin and vinculin density is still low . Spatial distribution of adhesion proteins in Cas - vinculin clusters Time - lapse imaging of spreading Cas mSc YFP - VCL cells showed that Cas mSc is continuously added to the outer edge of Cas - vinculin clusters while YFP - VCL is added later , farther from the edge ( Figure 4A ) . We confirmed this distribution by quantifying mScarlet and YFP intensity profiles along the axis of multiple , 4  m - long Cas - vinculin clusters in several cells ( Figure 4B ) . Cas mSc peaked ~ 0 . 75  m and YFP - VCL peaked ~ 1 . 5  m from the edge , reflecting their temporal order of recruitment . Similar profiles were obtained for endogenous Cas and vinculin when parental MCF10A cells were fixed and immunostained after 30 min of spreading ( Figure 4 – figure supplement 1 ) . Thus , we reasoned that we could estimate the temporal order of arrival and departure of other adhesion proteins from their spatial distribution within Cas - vinculin clusters . To this end , spreading cells were fixed , immunostained with various combinations of antibodies , and imaged . Normalized intensity profiles were plotted and aligned using endogenous Cas or Cas mSc as a fiducial marker . Results are presented as heat maps in Figure 4C and sample images in Figure 4 – figure supplement 2 - 3 . The intensity profiles show several important features . First , Cas phosphorylation , detected with pY410 Cas antibody , is maximal at the head of the cluster , ~ 0 . 5  m from the cell edge ( Figure 4C ) . We were unable to detect Crk with available antibodies but the Crk paralog CrkL peaked at the head of the cluster , consistent with high levels of phospho - Cas and rapid recruitment of Crk during adhesion assembly ( Figure 3C ) . The head of the cluster also contained the Cas SH3 - binding protein FAK , phosphorylated at Y861 , an SFK phosphorylation site ( Eliceiri et al . , 2002 ) . This population of FAK is unlikely to be active since it has low levels of 9 autophosphorylation at Y397 , a site required for kinase activity ( Le Coq et al . , 2022 ) . This suggests that the head of the cluster is the peak of SFK activity . Next , the peak of vinculin at ~ 1 . 5  m also contains highest levels of mechanosensing and structural components of focal adhesions , including kindlin2 , talin1 , paxillin , kinase - active pY397 FAK and F - actin , but decreased amounts of pY410Cas and total Cas ( Figure 4C ) . The presence of mechanosensing proteins suggests this part of the cluster is attached to the ECM and subject to mechanical force . Finally , the distribution of integrin  1 varied according to the antibody used . Total integrin  1 , detected with conformation - insensitive antibody AIIB2 ( Mould et al . , 2016 ) , forms two peaks , one coincident with pY410Cas and pY861FAK and one aligning with the peak of vinculin . The first peak was also detected with mAb13 , specific for inactive , bent - closed ( BC ) and extended - closed ( EC )  1 integrin conformations ( Su et al . , 2016 ) . The second peak was detected with 12G10 , specific for the active , extended - open ( EO ) conformation , and by 9EG7 , which detects both EO and EC conformations ( Su et al . , 2016 ) ( Figure 4C - D ) . This suggests that integrin activation increases as kindlin , talin and vinculin are recruited , consistent with the roles of kindlin / talin binding and mechanical force in integrin activation . Overall , while differential antibody access may affect immunofluorescent staining profiles , the spatial patterns suggest a temporal sequence of events in which active phosphorylated Cas and Crk / CrkL initially cluster with inactive integrin  1 and SFK - phosphorylated but kinase - inactive FAK . Since integrin  1 is in its BC conformation it is probably not attached to the ECM . Later , phosphorylated and total Cas levels decrease as integrin  1 recruits talin and kindlin , adopts the EO conformation , and able to bind ECM . Mechanical forces from the actin cytoskeleton then expose binding sites for vinculin and a mature focal adhesion is formed ( model , Figure 4E ) . Phosphorylated Cas is enriched in the adhesome Even though many imaging studies have detected Cas in focal adhesions , Cas is not routinely detected in the adhesome , as defined by proteomics or proximity biotinylation ( Kanchanawong et al . , 2022 ) . However , low abundance proteins may be significantly enriched in the adhesome 10 yet escape detection . We used Western blotting to estimate the proportion of Cas and selected other adhesion proteins in the adhesome relative to the non - adhesome ( supernatant ) fraction . Cells were seeded on polylysine or COLI for 60 min and incubated with protein - protein cross - linking reagents before lysis and separation of adhesome and supernatant fractions as described ( Humphries et al . , 2009 , Schiller et al . , 2011 ) . We then reversed the cross - links and performed Western blotting on the adhesome and supernatant samples . We found that the adhesome contained ~ 20 - 27 % of total cellular integrin  1 , talin , vinculin , paxillin , and total and autophosphorylated ( pY397 ) FAK , but only ~ 7 % of a control protein , ERK ( Figure 4 – figure supplement 4 ) . The adhesome fraction also contained ~ 25 % of total cellular Cas , suggesting it is as enriched in adhesions as bona fide adhesome proteins . Moreover , the adhesome also contained ~ 73 % of phospho - Cas , detected with pY410 or pY249 antibodies , and pY861 FAK . This suggests that pY410 Cas , pY249 Cas and pY861 FAK are significantly enriched in the adhesome fraction relative to their non - phosphorylated ( or in the case of FAK , pY397 phosphorylated ) forms . This suggests that these phosphorylations occur locally within adhesions and are rapidly lost when Cas or FAK dissociate . In contrast , autophosphorylated pY397 FAK remains active in the cytosol . Cas , Crk and SFKs regulate vinculin recruitment and focal adhesion assembly The early arrival of Cas at sites of future focal adhesions suggests Cas may nucleate adhesion assembly . To test this possibility , we depleted Cas from Cas mSc cells using siRNA ( Figure 5 – figure supplement 1A ) . Cas - depleted cells were non - migratory and their adhesions were immobile ( Figure 5 – figure supplement 1B , Supplementary Video 6 ) . Initial cell attachment and spreading were strongly inhibited , with significant decreases in cell area . Cas depletion inhibited focal adhesion formation , and Cas and vinculin intensity in remaining adhesions were inhibited to a similar degree ( Figure 5A - B ) . Immunostaining of other focal adhesion proteins including talin1 , kindlin2 and FAK in the remaining adhesions was also reduced ( Figure 5 – figure supplement 1C ) . By way of comparison , we treated cells with vinculin siRNA . Vinculin depletion was inefficient ( Figure 5 – figure supplement 1A ) , but significantly reduced vinculin intensity in adhesions ( Figure 5A - B ) . However , there was no reduction in cell spreading , the number of Cas clusters , or the intensity of Cas in vinculin - depleted cells . This suggests that Cas 11 regulates vinculin recruitment but vinculin does not regulates Cas recruitment , consistent with their order of assembly . To control for possible non - specific effects of Cas siRNA , we transduced MCF10A cells to express tagged wildtype or mutant mouse Cas , and knocked down endogenous Cas with human Cas - specific siRNA . As shown in Figure 5 – figure supplement 2 , wildtype mouse Cas ( mCasWT ) rescued cell spreading and adhesion formation and was recruited approximately a minute before vinculin . However , mutant mouse Cas ( mCas15F ) , lacking the fifteen YxxP phosphorylation sites in the SD , did not rescue cell spreading or adhesion formation . We investigated whether Crk / CrkL and SFKs are required for Cas - dependent focal adhesion assembly . We used siRNA to deplete Crk , CrkL or both and measured the time lag between Cas and vinculin recruitment . Depleting Crk and CrkL together but not separately slowed vinculin recruitment significantly , suggesting functional overlap ( Figure 5C , Figure 5 – figure supplement 3A - C , Supplementary Video 7 ) . Inhibiting SFKs with the pan - SFK inhibitor eCF506 also significantly delayed vinculin recruitment ( Figure 5D , Supplementary Video 7 bottom panels ) . To test whether a specific SFK is required , we knocked down each of the major SFKs - Src , Fyn and Yes1 - and measured adhesion and spreading . Remarkably , cell spreading , adhesion number , vinculin intensity , and Cas phosphorylation were all inhibited by depletion of Yes1 but not Src or Fyn , while Cas cluster formation was normal ( Figure 5E , Figure 5 – figure supplement 3D - F ) . This implies that Yes1 may have a special role in phosphorylating Cas and recruiting Crk / CrkL to stimulate adhesion assembly in MCF10A cells spreading . FAK , kindlin and talin are not required for Cas clustering We found that Cas and FAK cluster together early during adhesion assembly ( Figure 4C ) , raising the possibility that FAK recruits Cas , as reported in spreading fibroblasts ( Zhang et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore , we tested whether FAK is required for Cas clustering by depleting FAK with siRNA . Depleting FAK had no effect on MCF10A cell spreading , the intensity of Cas or vinculin clusters , or the median time delay between Cas and vinculin recruitment ( Figure 5 – figure supplement 4A - C ) . Kindlin2 and talin1 directly bind integrin tails and play important roles in integrin adhesion in fibroblasts , with kindlin2 interacting with paxillin and talin1 recruiting 12 vinculin and providing attachment for actin , enabling force generation , adhesion maturation and cell spreading ( Bachmann et al . , 2023 ) . Kindlin2 or talin1 siRNA had no effect on Cas clustering , but depleting talin1 decreased cell spreading and the intensity of vinculin clusters , and depleting either kindlin2 or talin1 increased the time delay between Cas and vinculin recruitment ( Figure 5 – figure supplement 4D - F ) . This suggests a sequence of events where Cas regulates cell spreading and recruitment of talin1 and kindlin2 , and talin1 and kindlin2 are required to recruit vinculin . Cas regulates “outside - in” integrin activation Integrins can be activated “inside - out” by proteins binding to their cytoplasmic tails , or “outside - in” by interactions with the ECM or with molecules or ions that stabilize the active open conformation ( Hynes 2002 ) . We tested whether Cas is required for outside - in adhesion assembly by treating control or Cas - depleted cells with Mn 2 + , which stabilizes the active integrin conformation ( Gailit et al . , 1988 , Lenter et al . , 1993 ) . While Mn 2 + increased the spread area of control cells , it did not increase spreading of Cas siRNA - treated cells and did not rescue the intensity of vinculin clusters ( Figure 5F ) . As a control for potential off - target effects of Cas siRNA we found that expression of mCasWT but not mCas15F rescued outside - in signaling by Mn 2 + ( Figure 5 – figure supplement 5A - C ) . This suggests that phosphorylation of Cas is rate - limiting for outside - in as well as inside - out integrin activation . Cas regulates focal adhesion assembly on different ECM , in different cell types , and through different integrins Our finding that Cas and SFKs are required for adhesion assembly conflicts with previous results ( Bockholt et al . , 1995 , Webb et al . , 2004 ) . However , the previous studies used mutant fibroblasts spreading on fibronectin ( FN ) while we used epithelial cells on COLI . This raises the possibility that Cas may be dispensable for adhesion formation in certain cell types or ECM . To investigate further , we depleted Cas from MCF10A cells and plated them on FN or COLI . Cas - depletion inhibited cell spreading and the number , area and vinculin intensity of adhesions on both substrates ( Figure 6A ) . Moreover , time - lapse imaging showed that Cas preceded vinculin clustering by a similar time interval on FN as on COLI ( Figure 6B , Supplementary video 8 ) . 13 Therefore , Cas plays a similar role in adhesion assembly when epithelial cells attach to either FN or COLI . To test whether Cas also regulates adhesion assembly in fibroblasts , we depleted Cas from human foreskin fibroblasts ( HFFs ) and plated them on FN or COLI . As with epithelial cells , Cas depletion inhibited HFF cell spreading and adhesion formation on both ECMs ( Figure 6C , Figure 6 – supplementary figure 1A ) . Proteomic analysis of MCF10A cells reveals expression of a variety of  and  integrin chains ( Ly et al . , 2018 ) . However , all  chains that are expressed can heterodimerize with  1 , and all the  chains that are expressed can heterodimerize with  v ( Hynes 2002 ) . We tested the roles of  1 and  v heterodimers in Cas - dependent adhesion of epithelial and fibroblast cells using siRNA . On COLI ,  1 depletion strongly inhibited spreading and recruitment of vinculin to Cas clusters , while depleting  v had smaller effects . In contrast , on FN , both  1 and  v were required for spreading and vinculin recruitment ( Figure 6 – figure supplement 1B - C ) . Thus , Cas regulates  1 - dependent adhesion assembly on COLI , and  1 - or  v - dependent adhesion assembly FN . To further identify the specific integrins regulated by Cas , we noted that MCF10A cells express  chains  2 , 3 , 5 and v at 10 - fold higher level than other  chains , while  3 is under - expressed relative to  1 and  6 ( Ly et al . , 2018 ) . This makes  2  1 a strong candidate to bind COLI and  5  1 and  v  6 strong candidates to bind FN . Indeed , integrin α2β1 - blocking mAb P1E6 ( Carter et al . , 1990 , Tuckwell et al . , 1995 ) prevented COLI binding while integrin α5β1 - blocking monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) P8D4 ( Alfandari et al . , 2003 , Davidson et al . , 2002 ) prevented FN binding ( Figure 6 - figure supplement 2A ) . The exact  v integrin regulated by Cas is unclear , but immunofluorescence of HFFs spreading on FN did not reveal any  v clusters that do not also contain  1 ( Figure 6 – figure supplement 2B ) . Early  1 clusters at the edge lack  v . Taken together , these results suggest that Cas nucleates α2β1 and α5β1 adhesions on COLI and FN respectively , and is also required for subsequent recruitment of  v on FN . SFK - Cas - Crk - Rac1 signaling regulates adhesion assembly 14 SFK - Cas - Crk / CrkL signaling is mediated by Crk / CrkL effectors including DOCK180 , a Rac1 GEF ( Chodniewicz et al . , 2004 ) . Rac1 is known to regulate lamellipodia protrusion by binding to the WAVE regulatory complex ( WRC ) and driving Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin polymerization ( Takenawa et al . , 2007 ) . Transient activation of Rac1 also induces formation of nascent adhesions at the cell edge , although the specific mechanism is unclear ( Nobes et al . , 1995 , Zaidel - Bar et al . , 2003 ) . We used a Forster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) biosensor ( Rac1 - 2G ) to measure Rac1 activity during MCF10A cell adhesion ( Fritz et al . , 2015 ) . Rac1 - 2G FRET activity was stimulated around the periphery of cells attaching to collagen and was inhibited by the Rac1 - specific inhibitor EHT1864 ( Onesto et al . , 2008 ) ( Figure 7A B ) . EHT1864 also inhibited cell spreading and reduced and delayed vinculin clustering but had no effect on Cas clustering ( Figure 7B , Supplementary Video 9 top ) . Importantly , depleting Cas or Yes1 inhibited Rac1 ( Figure 7C - D ) , consistent with Rac1 activation by the SFK - Cas - Crk / CrkL pathway ( Chodniewicz et al . , 2004 ) . Together , these results suggest that early clustering of phosphorylated Cas with Crk and inactive integrins activates Rac1 to trigger both cell spreading and assembly of vinculin - containing focal adhesions . Linkage between cell spreading and adhesion assembly through positive and negative feedback If the sole function of Cas in focal adhesion assembly is to activate Rac1 , then Rac1 activation may bypass the need for Cas . To test this possibility , we over - expressed either wildtype or constitutively - active GFP - Rac1 Q61L in MCF10A Cas mSc cells by transient transfection and examined cells during attachment to collagen . As expected , GFP - Rac1 Q61L cells spread more than GFP - Rac1 WT cells ( Figure 8A ) . Surprisingly , Cas depletion prevented Rac1 - induced spreading ( Figure 8A ) . This suggests that , even though Cas requires Rac1 to support normal spreading and adhesion formation , active Rac1 requires Cas to induce spreading , raising the possibility of a positive feedback loop from Rac1 back to Cas . We investigated which Rac1 effector may be involved in positive feedback on Cas . Rac1 stimulates localized production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) by the Nox1 NADPH - dependent oxidase by binding p47 phox ( Ushio - Fukai 2006 ) . ROS are short - range signaling molecules , rapidly reacting with and inhibiting protein - tyrosine phosphatases ( PTPs ) and 15 increasing local tyrosine phosphorylation of various substrates including Cas , SFKs , and p190RhoGAP ( Garton et al . , 1996 , Giannoni et al . , 2005 , Nimnual et al . , 2003 , Tonks 2005 ) . Thus , Rac1 potentially activates Cas through a Rac1 - ROS - PTP - SFK - Cas pathway . Such a positive feedback loop , where the output signal is fed back as input , can amplify the signal , enhancing the outcome ( Brandman et al . , 2008 ) . To test whether ROS are involved in positive feedback and adhesion assembly in MCF10A cells , we inhibited Nox1 with diphenylamineiodonium ( DPI ) ( Reis et al . , 2020 ) . DPI inhibited Rac1 ( Figure 8B ) , inhibited cell spreading , and delayed vinculin recruitment to Cas clusters ( Figure 8C , Supplementary Video 9 ) . This suggests that positive feedback through ROS amplifies and sustains SFK - Cas - Crk / CrkL - Rac1 activity that recruits vinculin . Positive feedback loops require negative feedback to avoid runaway amplification ( Brandman et al . , 2008 ) . Phosphorylation - dependent signaling can be inhibited by PTPs or phosphorylation - dependent proteolysis . Cas signaling is inhibited by negative feedback through the CRL5 SOCS6 ubiquitin ligase complex , which targets activated Cas for proteasomal degradation ( Teckchandani et al . , 2016 , Teckchandani et al . , 2014 ) . We tested whether CRL5 SOCS6 regulates focal adhesion assembly during MCF10A cell attachment . Either SOCS6 depletion or a Cullin inhibitor , MLN4924 , shortened  t 1 / 2 ( VCL - Cas ) during cluster assembly , consistent with CRL5 SOCS6 interfering with focal adhesion formation by negative feedback on phospho - Cas signaling ( Figure 8D , Supplementary Video 10 ) . Together , these results suggest a model in which nascent clusters of inactive integrin  1 , phosphorylated Cas , active SFKs and Crk stimulate Rac1 and generate ROS , creating positive feedback that strengthens and maintains signaling , fine - tuned by negative feedback from CRL5 SOCS6 . Subsequently , integrin  1 is activated and talin1 , kindlin2 , vinculin and other mechanosensing proteins assemble to form a focal adhesion ( Figure 8E ) . 16 Discussion Recent studies of focal adhesion assembly have elucidated the fundamental role of mechanosensitive proteins such as talin in activating integrins and recruiting vinculin under RhoA - dependent actomyosin tension ( Henning Stumpf et al . , 2020 , Kanchanawong et al . , 2010 , Legerstee et al . , 2021 , Wolfenson et al . , 2019 , Zhu et al . , 2021 ) . Other structural components of focal adhesions are recruited within a few seconds of talin binding and ECM engagement ( Bachir et al . , 2014 , Choi et al . , 2008 , Han et al . , 2021 , Laukaitis et al . , 2001 ) . Steps preceding mechanosensing are unclear , however . Our results suggest a two - step model in which SFKs , Cas , Crk / CrkL and Rac1 play a key role before talin and vinculin ( Figure 8E ) . In the first step , phosphorylated Cas and Crk / CrkL cluster with inactive integrin  1 . This step does not require talin1 , kindlin2 , vinculin or other structural proteins tested , and these proteins are only present at low level . Moreover , the integrin is inactive , so presumably not bound to the ECM . The clusters appear to grow through positive feedback involving SFKs , Cas , Crk / CrkL , Rac1 and ROS , opposed by negative feedback through CRL5 SOCS6 . Clusters may need to reach a critical size for force transmission before the next step can occur ( Coyer et al . , 2012 ) . In the second step , integrin  1 is activated and mechanosensing and structural proteins accumulate . FAK is present at low level in step one but is not activated until step two , consistent with FAK as a mechanosensor ( Le Coq et al . , 2022 ) . Remarkably , levels of total and phosphorylated Cas decline during the second step . Thus , in our model , Cas regulates the first step of integrin clustering but may not be needed for the final assembly . Our model is based largely on experiments using epithelial cells attaching to collagen through integrin  2  1 and contrast with previous studies reporting normal focal adhesion assembly when Cas and SFK - mutant fibroblasts were spreading or migrating on fibronectin ( Bockholt et al . , 1995 , Webb et al . , 2004 ) . Fibronectin adhesions contain  v as well as  1 integrin heterodimers , so in principle a non -  1 integrin could bypass the need for Cas . Different integrins are known to have different properties . For example , integrin  v adhesions are larger and more reliant on RhoA than integrin  1 adhesions ( Coyer et al . , 2012 ) , and talin1 binds more strongly to  3 than  1 ( Anthis et al . , 2010 , Lu et al . , 2016 ) . However , our preliminary experiments suggest that the two - step model applies also to fibroblasts on fibronectin . We found that Cas is required for epithelial and fibroblast adhesion and spreading on fibronectin , mediated by  5  1 and one or 17 more  v integrins . Cas clusters were also precursors of focal adhesions when epithelial cells spread on fibronectin . A Cas requirement for adhesion assembly in previous studies of mutant fibroblasts may have been hidden by expression of Cas family members or compensation during isolation of the cell lines . The type of integrin may explain the unexpected finding that Yes1 was limiting for integrin  1 adhesion assembly on collagen . Previous studies showed that Src regulates  v  3 adhesions but not  5  1 adhesions ( Felsenfeld et al . , 1999 ) , while Fyn and Cas were both needed for force - sensitive integrin  v  3 adhesions ( Kostic et al . , 2006 , von Wichert et al . , 2003 ) . Yes1 has a higher affinity than Src or Fyn for integrin  1 cytoplasmic tails ( Arias - Salgado et al . , 2003 , Arias - Salgado et al . , 2005 ) . In addition , liquid - ordered membrane microdomains ( lipid rafts ) contain Yes1 and Fyn but not Src ( Resh 1999 ) . These microdomains play a poorly - understood role in integrin clustering ( Lietha et al . , 2020 ) . Therefore , Yes1 preference for membrane microdomains and integrin tails may explain its special role in Cas - dependent integrin clustering . SFK - Cas - Crk / CrkL - Rac1 signaling not only initiates focal adhesion formation but also cell spreading . Curiously , cell spreading induced by active Rac1 was also Cas dependent . This appears to be due to positive feedback by Rac1 - dependent ROS generation and ROS activation of SFK - Cas signaling ( Garton et al . , 1996 , Giannoni et al . , 2005 , Nimnual et al . , 2003 , Tonks 2005 , Ushio - Fukai 2006 ) . Such feedback may serve to amplify and spread the signal , allowing the initial integrin - Cas clusters to grow in the face of negative feedback through CRL5 SOCS6 . However , the positive feedback makes it challenging to identify the exact mechanism for initial cluster growth and later adhesion assembly . For example , SFK - Cas - Crk / CrkL signaling may only be required to activate Rac1 , and Rac1 may then induce integrin clustering . Indeed , seminal studies showed that transient expression of active Rac1 induces focal complexes , although the Rac1 effector involved is unclear ( Nobes et al . , 1995 ) . That study also showed that Rac1 - induced focal complexes only mature into focal adhesions when Rac1 is inhibited , RhoA is activated , and actomyosin tension develops . The loss of Cas from clusters may thus be important in our system to locally decrease Rac1 activity and allow force generation for focal adhesion maturation . Unfortunately , the Rac1 sensor we used did not allow high resolution temporal imaging of Rac1 activity at the level of individual adhesions . Alternatively , Rac1 may only be needed to generate 18 ROS and stimulate Cas phosphorylation , and the latter may induce integrin clustering . This could occur by formation of networks of phospho - Cas , Crk , and multivalent Crk - binding proteins like DOCK180 , linked somehow to integrin tails . Recent studies elegantly showed that phospho - Cas forms protein condensates when mixed with an SH2 - SH3 protein , Nck , and an Nck - binding protein , N - WASP , in vitro ( Case et al . , 2022 ) . These protein condensates synergize with FAK - paxillin condensates and kindlin to cluster integrin tails on planar lipid bilayers in vitro . It is possible that similar protein condensates or networks form in our system . These condensates could then grow in space and time through Rac1 - induced actin polymerization , and positive feedback through ROS . Our studies also raise the question of how phospho - Cas induces integrin  1 clustering . Cas localization to focal adhesions requires its SH3 and FAT domains ( Donato et al . , 2010 , Nakamoto et al . , 1997 ) . These domains are thought to localize Cas in adhesions by direct binding to FAK , vinculin and paxillin ( Janostiak et al . , 2014a , Polte et al . , 1995 , Zhang et al . , 2017 ) . However , FAK , vinculin and paxillin levels were low in initial phospho - Cas - Crk - integrin clusters and increase when Cas levels decrease , suggesting that Cas associates with integrins through a different mechanism . For example , the integrin  1 tail may bind to Yes1 that is associated with Cas ( Arias - Salgado et al . , 2005 ) , or membrane microdomains could mediate co - clustering of Yes1 with integrins ( Lietha and Izard 2020 ) . Whatever the mechanism for cluster formation , cluster growth could then activate associated SFKs by increasing transphosphorylation ( Arias - Salgado et al . , 2003 , Berrier et al . , 2002 , Bodeau et al . , 2001 , Buensuceso et al . , 2003 ) . Further understanding of the precise mechanism will require additional in vivo and in vitro analysis . 19 Materials and Methods Plasmids pMSCV - Puro - EYFP - vinculin , pMSCV - Puro - EYFP - mCasWT , pMSCV - Puro - EYFP - mCas15F , and pBabe - Puro - mCherry - mVCL were described previously ( Teckchandani et al . , 2016 ) . EGFP - Rac1 WT and EGFP - Rac1 Q61L were provided by K . Wennerberg , University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill , NC ( Arthur et al . , 2004 ) . The following vectors were gifts from the indicated investigators : pmScarlet - i _ C1 ( Dorus Gadella , Addgene plasmid # 85044 ) , pORANGE cloning template vector ( Harold MacGillavry , Addgene # 131471 ) , pCE - mp53DD ( Shinya Yamanaka , Addgene # 41856 ) , pLenti - Rac1 - 2G ( Olivier Pertz , Addgene # 66111 ) , pcDNA3 . 1 - mGreenLantern ( Gregory Petsko , Addgene # 161912 ) ( Campbell et al . , 2020 ) , pMD2 . G and psPAX2 ( Didier Trono , Addgene # 12259 and 12260 ) . pLenti Ecto - pHluorin β 1 integrin with 4 - residue linkers was kindly provided by David A . Calderwood ( Yale University School of Medicine , USA ) ( Huet - Calderwood et al . , 2017 ) . Gene editing We inserted fluorescent protein tags into endogenous genes by homology - independent intron targeting , with modifications ( Serebrenik et al . , 2019 , Zhong et al . , 2021 ) . Intron targeting has several advantages over exon targeting . First , the exact position of artificial exon within the intron is unimportant , allowing insertion at the single guide RNA ( sgRNA ) SpCas9 target site with highest predicted efficiency . Second , the exon does not need to be inserted precisely , since errors should be corrected by RNA splicing . Thus , homology arms are unnecessary , shortening the donor sequence . Third , by inserting a fluorescent protein open - reading frame lacking an initiation codon , the majority of fluorescent cells should be correctly targeted and can be isolated by FACS without need for single - cell cloning . We used the pORANGE vector which encodes an sgRNA , SpCas9 , and a polylinker for subcloning the donor sequence ( Willems et al . , 2020 ) . Target sites were identified in introns of interest using the CHOPCHOP sgRNA designer ( Labun et al . , 2019 ) . Corresponding sgRNA sequences were synthesized ( Integrated DNA Technologies ) , annealed and inserted into pORANGE using combined restriction digestion and ligation at the BbsI sites . Donor sequences 20 were then inserted at the HindIII ( 5’ ) and XhoI or BamHI at ( 3’ ) sites using HindIII - HF and XhoI - HF or BamHI - HF ( New England Biolabs ) . For N - terminal tagging of Cas with mScarlet , the donor contained : ( a ) a canonical splice acceptor ( SA ) sequence ( Smith 1997 ) ; ( b ) mScarlet , lacking its initiation codon and followed by a 24 nucleotide sequence encoding GGMDELYK ; ( c ) a canonical splice donor ( SD ) sequence ( Connelly et al . , 1988 ) . The donor sequence for mScarlet and linker was PCR amplified from pmScarlet - i _ C1 using Q5 High - Fidelity DNA polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) . For C - terminal tagging of ITGB1 and Crk , the donor contained : ( a ) the SA sequence ; ( b ) the last exon coding sequence with the stop codon replaced by a linker ( GGGGARRRGQAGDPPVAT for ITGB1 ( Parsons et al 2008 ) or GGGS for Crk ) , the fluorescent tag and stop codon ; ( c ) the SV40 3’ processing and polyadenylation sequence ( Connelly et al . , 1988 ) . The ends of donor were sandwiched between inverted sites for the gene targeting sgRNA , ensuring donor excision by SpCas9 ( Connelly et al . , 1988 , Willems et al . , 2020 ) ( see figure supplements for Cas9 target site orientation ) . The donor sequences were ordered as gBlocks ( Integrated DNA Technologies ) . The targeting vectors were transiently transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 into MCF10A epithelial cells or HeLa cells together with pCE - mp53DD , an episomal plasmid encoding a dominant - negative mutant of TP53 , to avoid apoptosis due to DNA damage responses ( Haapaniemi et al . , 2018 , Ihry et al . , 2018 ) . Two weeks after transfection , fluorescent cells were checked visually on a Leica Stellaris 5 confocal microscope and selected by FACS .

Cells were washed three times with cold phosphate - buffer saline ( PBS ) followed by lysis in RIPA buffer ( 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 % sodium deoxycholate , 0 . 1 % SDS , 20 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EGTA ) with freshly added protease and phosphatase inhibitors ( 10 µg / mL Aprotinin , 1 mM PMSF , 1 mM sodium vanadate ) on ice . The lysates were collected after 30 min of incubation on ice and centrifuged at 12 , 000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C . Supernatants were collected and adjusted to equal protein concentration using the Pierce BCA protein assay kit . 28 Lysates were adjusted to SDS sample buffer , heated at 95°C , and resolved on SDS - PAGE using 15 % polyacrylamide / 0 . 133 % bis - acrylamide or 12 . 5 % acrylamide / 0 . 1 % bis - acrylamide gels , and transferred on to nitrocellulose membrane . Blocking was performed in Odyssey blocking buffer ( LI - COR Biosciences ) supplemented with 5 % BSA for 30 min . After blocking , membrane was probed with the primary antibody overnight , washed in Tris - buffered saline ( TBS ) 0 . 1 % Tween 20 , followed by incubation for 45 min with IRDye 800CW goat anti - rabbit or 680RD goat anti - mouse conjugated secondary antibodies . Images were collected using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System ( LI - COR Biosciences ) and quantified using ImageJ . Cell spreading and migration assays Cells were treated with siRNA using the double transfection method as described above . Cells were starved overnight in assay media ( MCF10A ) or DME ( HeLa ) , then detached with Accutase and resuspended in assay media or DME . Cells were incubated for 60 min in 5 % CO 2 at 37°C in suspension before adding to glass - bottom dishes ( FluoroDish , FD35 - 100 , World Precision Instruments ) or 12 - mm diameter coverslips ( Fisherbrand 1254580 ) that had been previously coated with 50  g / ml collagen - I ( Advance Biomatrix , # 5056 ) or 5  g / ml fibronectin ( Sigma , # F1141 ) for at least 3 hr at 37°C and washed with PBS . Pharmacological agents were added just before seeding cells for imaging . Live - imaging Dual - color imaging of live cells was performed for a 30 - min time period , either immediately after plating the cells , to record attachment and spreading , or approximately 24 hr after plating , to record spontaneous lamellipodia formation . Images were recorded in 4 - 5 fields of view on a fully automated TIRF microscope ( Nikon Ti , 100x / 1 . 49 CFI Apo TIRF oil immersion objective ) equipped with Perfect Focus , motorized x - y stage , fast piezo z stage , stage - top incubator with temperature and CO 2 control , and Andor iXon X3 EMCCD camera with 512 x 512 - pixel chip ( 16 micron pixels ) . The images were acquired using Nikon NIS Elements software and processed using ImageJ . Frame rate varied between 15 and 20 s depending on the number of fields of view recorded . Slight drift in the dual color time lapse images was corrected using ImageJ registration tool Image Stabilizer . 29 Cell migration was imaged once every 15 min for 12 hr using phase - contrast microscopy on an IncuCyte S3 and analyzed using ImageJ . Immunofluorescence imaging MCF10A Cas mSc cells , either expressing YFP - vinculin or not , were plated on glass - bottom dishes or coverslips and allowed to attach for 30 min before fixation with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min . Cells were permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in PBS for 5 min , and blocked for an hour in 5 % normal goat serum , 2 % BSA in PBS , all at room temperature . The cells were incubated with different combinations of primary antibodies ( 1 : 200 dilution ) for either 2 - 3 hours at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C , then washed gently three times . Alexa Fluor - conjugated secondary antibodies were added at 1 : 200 dilution for 1 hr at room temperature . Alexa Fluor 488 or 647 - conjugated phalloidin was used for F - actin . Glass - bottom dishes were left in PBS for TIRF microscopy as above . Coverslips were mounted in ProLong Gold ( Invitrogen ) for confocal microscopy using a Dragonfly 200 High - speed Spinning disk confocal imaging platform ( Andor Technology Ltd . ) on a Leica DMi8 microscope stand equipped with a 100x / 1 . 4 oil immersion objective , iXon EMCCD and sCMOS Zyla cameras and Fusion Version 2 . 3 . 0 . 36 ( Oxford Instruments ) software together with Imaris simultaneous deconvolution . The most ventral plane was used for quantification . Immunofluorescence quantification Macros were written in ImageJ for uniform image processing and analysis . Backgrounds were subtracted and intensities adjusted equally across each image set . For analysis of the spatial distribution of the proteins and phosphoproteins within Cas / vinculin clusters , a line ( 5x25 - pixels width x length , 0 . 16 micron / pixel ) was plotted along the major axis of a Cas mSc cluster , starting from the outer edge and moving inwards . The intensity profile for each antibody along this line was quantified in ImageJ and aligned using Cas mSc as a reference point . The mean normalized intensity profile for each antibody was then calculated across 20 - 25 regions from several cells . A heat map for the mean intensity profile of the normalized value was generated using GraphPad Prism . 30 To analyze the number and intensity of clusters containing either Cas or vinculin , or both , images were first spit into individual channels and then summed using the ‘Image calculator’ command in ImageJ . This summed image was used to generate a binary image mask by applying manual threshold through the Yen method . ROIs > 20 pixels ( 0 . 52  m 2 ) were then counted and their mean areas and mean Cas and vinculin intensities quantified . Cell area was quantified either manually by drawing around the cell or from a binary mask created by thresholding through the Triangle method , setting minimum size as 50 pixels . Quantification of cluster kinetics from two - color TIRF videos TIRF image datasets were exported as two - channel time - series hyperstacks in TIF format . Quantification of the time shift between red ( Cas mSc ) and green ( YFP - VCL ,  1 - EctopH , ITGB1 GFP or Crk mGL ) cluster formation was performed in MATLAB ( R2021b ) . The pipeline involves the following steps : drift correction , image preprocessing and denoising , focal adhesion segmentation and tracking , intensities extraction and normalization , and signal analysis . Drifts between timeframes were corrected by registering the image of one frame to the image of the previous frame using a translation transformation . Drift corrected timeseries were then denoised with a median filter and their background was equalized with a top - hat transform . Clusters were segmented separately in each channel at each timeframe by intensity thresholding and size filtering . Threshold values were arbitrarily defined as a quarter of the intensity value of the 50 th brightest pixel of the dataset for each channel , and the union of the binary masks of the two channels with an area greater than 20 pixels ( 0 . 52  m 2 ) was used to define clusters . Clusters were tracked over time by creating a 3D stack ( XYT ) and by computing the resulting connected components . Only clusters tracked in 3 or more frames ( ≥40 s ) were quantified . For each tracked cluster , the average mean intensity of each channel over time was extracted by first measuring the mean intensity within the mask at each timeframe from time zero to the end , resulting in a number of intensity traces equal to the number of timeframes where the cluster was tracked . To calculate the time shift between the red and green channel intensity profiles for each tracked cluster , average mean intensity traces were rescaled to the [ 0 1 ] value range , and after smoothing the signal by applying a moving average filter , the time at which the rescaled intensity reaches 31 0 . 5 ( t 1 / 2 ) was interpolated . The time shift was finally calculated by subtracting red ( Cas ) t 1 / 2 from green ( vinculin , integrin or Crk ) t 1 / 2 . Adhesome isolation Adhesome samples were isolated as described with minor modifications ( Schiefermeier et al . , 2014 ) . MCF10A cells were detached from near - confluent 5 - cm plates , resuspended in assay media , incubated in suspension for 30 min , then re - seeded onto an equal number of 5 - cm plates that had been precoated with 50  g / ml collagen . After one hour at 37°C , one dish was washed and lysed in 400  l RIPA buffer to provide a sample of total protein ( T ) and the other dishes were washed gently with room temperature PBS and incubated with 2 ml freshly diluted 0 . 5 mM dithiobis ( succinimidyl propionate ) ( DSP , EMD Millipore 322133 ) 0 . 05 mM ( 1 , 4 - di [ 3 ' - ( 2 ' - pyridyldithio ) propionamido ] butane ) ( DPDPB , Sigma 16646 ) in PBS for 5 min at room temperature . Cross - linking was terminated by washing twice with 50 mM Tris 140 mM NaCl pH7 . 4 before transferring to ice . 400  l RIPA buffer was added and the plates were rocked at 4°C for 1 hr . Supernatants ( S ) were collected in a 2 - ml microtube ( Axygen MCT - 200 - L - C ) . The plates were washed twice with PBS , drained , and 400  l RIPA buffer added . 2 - Mercaptoethanol was added to 2 % concentration to all samples , and all microtubes and dishes were sealed and incubated at 50°C for 1 hr . After cooling to room temperature , the dish was scraped and the adhesome ( A ) fraction was transferred to a 2 - ml microtube . Total , supernatant and adhesome fractions were sonicated ( 10 s , microtip ) to shear DNA and the proteins were precipitated by adding 1 . 6 ml acetone and placing at - 20°C for 1 hr . After centrifugation ( 10 min , 14 , 000 rpm ) , pellets were drained , dried in a stream of air , and incubated with 25  l 5x concentrated SDS sample buffer at 95°C for 5 min , then 100  l RIPA buffer was added to all tubes . Samples were centrifuged and equal volumes analyzed by SDS PAGE , typically on 10 % acrylamide / 0 . 13 % bisacrylamide gels , followed by Western blotting . The procedure was scaled up as needed to run replicate blots for probing with different antibody combinations . On occasion , dilutions of the T sample were loaded to estimate detection sensitivity . Ratiometric FRET imaging The Rac1 - 2G reporter was expressed in MCF10A cells by lentiviral transduction . After siRNA treatment , cells were allowed to attach to collagen for 30 min in the absence or presence of 32 various inhibitors , then fixed and mounted . Coverslips were imaged on a Leica SP8 confocal microscope using Leica HCX Plan Apo 63X / 1 . 40 oil immersion objective . Excitation and emission wavelengths as follows : donor ( mTFP1 ) excitation 440 nm , emission 450 - 510 nm : FRET excitation 440 nm , emission 515 - 600 nm ; acceptor ( mVenus ) excitation 514 nm , emission 515 - 600 nm . All channels were collected on the HyD detectors . Images were processed with the Lightening deconvolution ( Leica LASX software ) and the FRET ratio in the most ventral plane was quantified using ImageJ as described ( Kardash et al . , 2011 ) . Statistics Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism . Median and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated for non - normal distributions of measurements from single cells . Data from multiple cells or biological replicates were assumed to follow normal distributions allowing calculation of mean and standard error of the mean ( SEM ) in cases where data from multiple cells in biologically independent experiments were combined . Pairwise comparisons between control and experimental populations testing independent hypotheses were made using the non - parametric Mann Whitney U - test . Experiments testing alternative hypotheses were analyzed using the non - parametric Kruskal - Wallis ANOVA followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison test .

Graphs show median Δt 1 / 2 ( VCL - Cas ) from 8 - 12 cells in three biological repeats . All error bars represent mean and SEM and all P values by Mann Whitney U tests . ( E ) Two - step model . In the first step , co - clustering of Cas with inactive integrin leads to SFK - dependent phosphorylation of Cas , recruitment of Crk / CrkL , activation of Rac1 , ROS production , and positive feedback that strengthens and maintains signaling to form a nascent adhesion . Positive feedback is opposed by negative feedback resulting from CRL5 SOCS6 . In a second step , integrin  1 is activated and talin1 , kindlin2 , vinculin , actin and other proteins are recruited to form a focal adhesion . The second step may be triggered by growth of the nascent adhesion to a critical size , or by decreased occupancy with Cas .
