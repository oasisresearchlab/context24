Mg 2 þ promotes osteogenesis , which makes Mg - based scaffolds popular for research on orthopedic implant materials . Angiogenesis plays an important role in the process of bone tissue repair and regeneration , and it is one of the important problems in BTE urgently needs to be solved . Methods : Mg was ﬁ rstly coated with Ca - de ﬁ cient hydroxyapatite ( CDHA ) via hydrothermal treatment , and pol - ydopamine ( DOPA ) was then used as the connecting medium to immobilize vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) on the CDHA coating . The physicochemical properties of the coatings were characterized by SEM , EDS , XPS , FTIR and immersion experiment in SBF . The ahesion , proliferation , and angiogenesis potential of the coatings were determined in vitro . Results : The composite coating signi ﬁ cantly improved the corrosion resistance of Mg and prohibited excessively high local alkalinity . VEGF could be ﬁ rmly immobilized on Mg via polydopamine . The CCK - 8 , live / dead staining and adhesion test results showed that the VEGF - DOPA - CDHA coating exhibited excellent biocompatibility and could signi ﬁ cantly improve the adhesion and proliferation of MC3T3 - E1 cells on Mg . Microtubule formation , immuno ﬂ uorescence and Quantitative Real - Time PCR ( qRT - PCR ) experiments showed that VEGF immobilized on Mg still possessed bioactivity in promoting the differentiation of rat mesenchymal stem cells into endothelial cells . Conclusion : In this study , we enabled the angiogenic biological activity of Mg by immobilizing VEGF on Mg . Mg was successfully coated with a functional VEGF - DOPA - CDHA composite coating . The CDHA coating signi ﬁ cantly increased the corrosion resistance of Mg and prohibited the negative effect of excessively high local alkalinity on the biological activity of VEGF . As an intermediate layer , the DOPA coating protects Mg , and DOPA provides a binding site for VEGF so that VEGF can be ﬁ rmly immobilized on Mg and give Mg angiogenic bioactivity during the initial period of implantation .

The development of tissue engineering technology provides a new option for the treatment of large bone defects . The regeneration of blood vessels is of great signi ﬁ cance for the repair of bone defects . In this study , VEGF was connected on the surface of degradable magnesium by covalent bonding .

Journal of Orthopaedic Translation 30 ( 2021 ) 82 – 92 dif ﬁ cult to repair spontaneously and need to be treated by bone trans - plantation or replacement implantation [ 2 ] . Autologous bone has the advantages of being osteoconductive , osteoinductive and angiogenic , and immune rejection is not problematic . These characteristics make autogenous bone the gold standard for bone defect treatment , but their limited availability is the main obstacle for the extensive application of autologous bone transplantation in clinical practice . In contrast , alloge - neic bone transplantation does not have the advantages of being osteo - conductive , osteoinductive and angiogenic and is also prone to cross infection , immune rejection and other problems [ 3 ] . Arti ﬁ cial scaffolds are considered a promising treatment for bone repair . The design of a biodegradable scaffold with excellent biocompatibility and mechanical properties , as well as a good ability to promote osteogenesis and vascu - larization , is of great signi ﬁ cance for the repair and regeneration of bone defects [ 4 ] . Ceramic , polymer and metals have been widely studied as scaffolds for the repair and regeneration of bone defects [ 5 ] . Excellent mechanical properties are an important advantage of the use of metallic biomaterials as scaffold materials [ 6 ] . Porous titanium and tantalum can form an osseous bond with bone tissue [ 7 ] . Therefore , there have been many reports on the application of porous titanium and tantalum in bone defect repair and regeneration [ 8 – 11 ] . Both Ti - and Ta - based biomaterials are bioinert and have good stability in the human environment , which en - sures good biocompatibility [ 12 , 13 ] . However , these two materials lack bioactivity to promote bone regeneration [ 14 ] . Among all medical metallic biomaterials , Mg , a biodegradable orthopedic implant bioma - terial , has received extensive attention [ 15 ] . Mg exhibits excellent biocompatibility , and its mechanical properties are similar to those of cortical bone . Moreover , Mg 2 þ released by the degradation of Mg also has the advantage of being osteogenic [ 16 – 18 ] . Therefore , as an orthopedic implant material , Mg can not only promote ﬁ xation but also accelerate bone repair . Based on these characteristics , Mg is also considered an alternative tissue - engineered scaffold biomaterial [ 19 , 20 ] . For the repair of bone defects , vascularization plays an important role in the formation of new bone [ 4 ] . Blood vessels transport nutrients to bone cells in bone tissues and carry metabolites at the same time to ensure that the new bone tissue formed is always in a healthy state [ 21 ] . Many studies have also investigated the integration of angiogenic agents with biomaterials used in bone repair to regenerate bone defects [ 22 – 24 ] . For example , VEGF can induce the differentiation of stem cells into vascular endothelial cells and induce the migration , differentiation and formation of microtubule structures in endothelial cells in sur - rounding tissues [ 25 , 26 ] . Its role in promoting the formation of new blood vessels is well known . VEGF can also promote the migration , proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts ; therefore , VEGF is a very important factor in the process of bone repair [ 27 ] . Based on this , the use of VEGF in the ﬁ eld of bone tissue engineering biomaterials has been widely studied [ 28 , 29 ] . There are many binding modes between growth factors and biomaterials , and different binding modes have different ef - fects on the release kinetics of growth factors and the maintenance of bioactivity . For example , the growth factors carried by physically adsorbed deposits and hydrogels maintain their bioactivity well , but the release of high amounts of the growth factors during the initial phase after biomaterial implantation remains problematic [ 30 ] . Covalent immobilization can stabilize growth factors on site , but chemical immobilization may destroy the functional bonds of growth factors , resulting in the loss of factor bioactivity [ 31 ] . Dopamine - assisted immobilization is an emerging and promising strategy for delivering drugs [ 32 ] . Chye Khoon Poh et al . successfully immobilized VEGF on the surface of Ti by DOPA and veri ﬁ ed that immobilized VEGF maintained its bioactivity by inducing the differentiation of stem cells into endothelial cells [ 33 ] . The rapid degradation rate of Mg has always been an impor - tant problem that needs to be solved before Mg can be used as an or - thopedic implant biomaterials [ 19 ] . The degradation of Mg causes the surrounding environment to be highly alkalinic , which has a negative impact on the bioactivity of VEGF [ 34 ] . Coatings are commonly used to improve the corrosion resistance of Mg based metallic materials [ 35 ] . The chemical composition of hydroxyapatite ( HA ) is similar to that of bone inorganic salts , so HA coatings are widely studied as surface coating of Mg [ 36 ] . However , when HA coating is prepared on biodegradable Mg - based metallic materials , the resulting coating is usually a calcium - de ﬁ cient HA ( CDHA ) layer ( calcium and phosphorus with an atomic ratio ranging from 1 . 33 to 1 . 65 ) . This is mainly due to the high ionization tendency of Mg , which leads to the inevitable corrosion of Mg based materials in aqueous solution , and the released Mg 2 þ ions can replace Ca 2 þ ions in HA structure . It is reported that CDHA seems to be more soluble than stoichiometric HA coating and may induce precipita - tion of new bone - like apatite after implantation , which just meets the requirements for biodegradable implants [ 37 ] . In this study , a protective CDHA coating was ﬁ rst prepared on the surface of Mg by hydrothermal treatment , and VEGF was then bound on the CDHA coating by means of DOPA covalent bonds , thus obtaining a VEGF - DOPA - CDHA coating , which was expected to endow Mg with the ability to induce angiogenesis . The changes in the surface morphology and chemical composition of the surface before and after surface modi - ﬁ cation were characterized by SEM , EDS , FTIR and XPS . ELISA and immuno ﬂ uorescence experiments were conducted to con ﬁ rm that VEGF bound to the surface of Mg . An immersion experiment was performed to monitor the pH change in SBF caused by Mg degradation . The biocom - patibility and angiogenesis of the VEGF - DOPA - CDHA coating were veri ﬁ ed by in vitro cell experiments . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Materials Extruded high - purity Mg ( HP Mg ) rods ( (cid:2) 99 . 99 wt % ) were provided by Dongguan Eontec Co . , Ltd . , China . Mg discs ( denoted as Mg ) with a diameter of 10 mm and a thickness of 3 mm were cut from the extruded Mg rod by electric sparking . The Mg discs were ground with SiC sand paper with a grit of 400 , followed by paper with grits of 800 , 1200 , and 2000 . The Mg discs were then ultrasonically rinsed sequentially with ethanol and distilled water for 5 min each and dried in warm air . Dopamine hydrochloride , ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid calcium disodium salt hydrate ( Ca - EDTA ) , potassium phosphate monobasic ( KH 2 PO4 ) and sodium hydroxide ( NaOH ) were purchased from Sigma - – Aldrich Chemical Co . Recombinant rat VEGF was purchased from PeproTech , Inc . The live / dead cell viability kit was purchased from Life Technologies ™ ( California , US ) . The rhodamine - phalloidin kit was pur - chased from Cytoskeleton Inc . ( Denver , USA ) . The recombinant rat VEGF ELISA kit was purchased from R & D Systems ( Minneapolis , US ) .

The unconjugated monoclonal mouse antihuman von Willebrand Factor ( vWF ) antibody and PECAM1 ( CD31 ) were purchased from Abcam ( Cambridge , UK ) . 2 . 2 . Sample preparation First , hydrothermal treatment was carried out to fabricate a CDHA coating on the surface of Mg as previously reported ( hereafter referred to as CDHA - Mg ) . In brief , a solution containing 0 . 25 M Ca - EDTA and KH 2 PO 4 was placed in an autoclave , and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 8 . 9 using a 5 M NaOH solution . The hydrothermal treatment was carried out at 90 (cid:3) C for 6 h . Subsequently , polydopamine was anchored to the CDHA coating via immersion of the hydrothermally treated specimens in a 2 mg / ml solution of dopamine ( 10 mM Tris buffer , pH ¼ 8 . 5 ) overnight in the dark ( hereafter referred to as DOPA - CDHA - Mg ) . Finally , the specimens were bound with VEGF by immersion in PBS containing 160 ng / ml VEGF for 3 h at 4 (cid:3) C ( hereafter referred to as VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg ) . J . Li et al . Journal of Orthopaedic Translation 30 ( 2021 ) 82 – 92 83 2 . 3 . Physicochemical characterizations of the coatings SEM and EDS were used to characterize the surface morphologies and chemical compositions of CDHA - Mg , DOPA - CDHA - Mg and VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg . The surface chemical structures of CDHA - Mg , DOPA - CDHA - Mg and VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg were determined with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( FTIR , Hyperion 3000 ) . The FTIR spectrum was recorded between 4000 and 500 cm (cid:4) 1 . The surface elemental composi - tion was studied using X - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( XPS , Empyrean - 100 ) . To assess rhVEGF , coatings were incubated with a FITC - conjugated rabbit anti - mouse IgG antibody ( diluted 1 : 200 , Alexa Fluor 488 , NOVUS Biologicals ) overnight at room temperature . Immuno ﬂ uo - rescent VEGF was viewed with a ﬂ uorescence microscope ( CLSM510 , Zeiss , USA ) . To determine the binding ef ﬁ ciency of VEGF on the DOPA membrane , the concentration of VEGF in the solution before and after VEGF binding on the sample surface was measured by an enzyme - linked immunosorbent method using an ELISA kit according to the manufac - turer ' s instructions . By determining the initial and remaining amounts of VEGF loaded in PBS before and after immersion , the amount of VEGF bound on the surface of the sample was calculated . In this study , SBF was used as the solution for the immersion exper - iment . SBF was prepared according to Kokubo ' s protocol [ 38 ] . The ratio of the volume of the soaking solution to the sample surface area was 1 . 25 ml / cm 2 . CDHA - Mg , DOPA - CDHA - Mg and VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg were placed in SBF at 37 (cid:3) C , and the immersion solution was changed every two days . On days 1 , 4 , 7 , 10 , 15 , 18 and 21 , pH changes of the immersion solution were recorded . The amount of VEGF in the VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg immersion solution was also measured by the ELISA method . PBS was used as immersion solution to characterize the release kinetics of Mg 2 þ . The ratio of the volume of the PBS to the sample surface area was 1 . 25 ml / cm 2 . On days 1 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 and 14 , the concentration of Mg 2 þ in the immersion solution were recorded . 2 . 4 . In vitro biocompatibility and bioactivity 2 . 4 . 1 . Cell culture The MC3T3 - E1 cell line ( murine calvarial osteoprogenitor cell line ) and rat bone mesenchymal stem cells ( rBMSCs ) were cultured in MEM / EBSS supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS , Gibco ) , 100 U / mL penicillin and 100 μ g / ml streptomycin . 2 . 5 . Cell viability and proliferation assay A pool of MC3T3 - E1 cells was thawed from a liquid nitrogen cell bank , expanded in a cell culture ﬂ ask , and harvested upon reaching con ﬂ uence . After three passages , 500 μ L of a cell suspension containing 5 (cid:5) 10 4 cells was drop - seeded onto the surfaces of CDHA - Mg , DOPA - CDHA - Mg , and VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg samples in 48 - well culture plates . Then , the culture plates were placed in an incubator at 37 (cid:3) C and 5 % CO 2 , and the medium was changed every two days . The proliferation of MC3T3 - E1 cells on the surfaces of CDHA - Mg , DOPA - CDHA - Mg , and VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg was characterized by CCK - 8 . At 1 , 4 , and 7 days , the culture medium was removed , fresh medium containing a 10 % volume of CCK - 8 reagent was added to each well , and the cells were incubated for 4 h . One hundred microliters of culture medium was transferred into a 96 - well plate , and the optical density was measured with a microplate reader at 450 nm . The biocompatibilities of CDHA - Mg , DOPA - CDHA - Mg and VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg samples were observed by live / dead staining ( LIVE / DEAD cell viability kit , Life Technologies ) . MC3T3 - E1 cells were cultured on the sample surfaces for 7 days , the culture medium was removed , and calcein AM and ethidium homodimer solutions diluted in PBS at 1 : 2000 and 1 : 1000 , respectively , were added to the wells and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark . The cell viabilities on the sur - faces of CDHA - Mg , DOPA - CDHA - Mg and VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg were determined under a ﬂ uorescence microscope . 2 . 6 . Direct cell adhesion and spreading assay After incubation for 24 h , rhodamine - phalloidin staining was used to observe the spreading of the MC3T3 - E1 cells cultured on CDHA - Mg , DOPA - CDHA - Mg and VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg . First , the specimens were ﬁ xed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and then per - meabilized with 0 . 2 % Triton - X 100 in PBS for 30 min . Subsequently , the specimens were washed with PBS three times . Finally , the specimens were stained with rhodamine - phalloidin for 45 min at room temperature , and nuclei were counterstained with 4 ’ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) for 30 min at room temperature . After incubation for 7 days , the samples were washed with PBS and ﬁ xed in 2 . 5 % v / v glutaraldehyde for 12 h at 4 (cid:3) C . Then , the samples were dehydrated in alcohol at gradually increasing concentrations ( 50 % , 60 % , 70 % , 80 % , 90 % , 95 % and 100 % ethanol in sequence ) for 10 min each , critical - point dried , and sputtered with Pt . SEM was used to observe the cell attachment morphology on the surfaces of CDHA - Mg , DOPA - CDHA - Mg and VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg . 2 . 7 . In vitro angiogenesis assay The effect of surface modi ﬁ cations on the angiogenic differentiation of rBMSCs was characterized by immunostaining , real - time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( qRT - PCR ) and tube formation assays . A 500 μ L cell suspension containing 2 (cid:5) 10 5 rBMSCs was drop - seeded onto the surfaces of the CDHA - Mg , DOPA - CDHA - Mg , and VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg samples in an incubator at 37 (cid:3) C and 5 % CO 2 , and the cul - ture medium was changed every two days . For immuno ﬂ uorescence microscopy , rBMSCs grown on the surfaces of CDHA - Mg , DOPA - CDHA - Mg , and VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg for 2 weeks were detached with trypsin . After the cells were centrifuged , 200 μ L of culture medium was added , blended evenly , and dropped onto the slide overnight . After the culture medium was removed , the cells on the slide were rinsed with PBS , ﬁ xed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 5 min , washed with PBS , permeated with 0 . 2 % Triton for 30 min , washed with PBS , and sealed with 10 % donkey serum for 1 h . For CD31 staining , the cells were incubated with primary anti - CD31 antibodies ( 1 : 200 , Abcam ) overnight at 4 (cid:3) C , rinsed in PBS and further stained with FITC - conjugated goat anti - mouse secondary anti - bodies ( 1 : 200 , Abcam ) . After washing with PBS , the cell nuclei were stained with DAPI . For vWF staining , the cells were incubated with a FITC - conjugated anti - vWF antibody ( 1 : 200 , Abcam ) overnight at 4 (cid:3) C , rinsed in PBS and further stained with DAPI . The cells were then viewed by confocal microscopy . The mRNA expression of CD31 and vWF was investigated by qRT - PCR . The rBMSCs were seeded on CDHA - Mg , DOPA - CDHA - Mg and VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg at a density of 2 (cid:5) 10 5 / well in 48 - well culture plates . After culturing for 7 and 14 days , the expression of CD31 and vWF was determined to evaluate the differentiation of the cultured cells . Total RNA was extracted from the cultured cells on the samples using TRIzol reagent ( Invitrogen Life Technologies ) at each time point and subse - quently converted into cDNA using PrimeScript RT Master Mix ( Takara ) . RT - PCRs were performed using SYBRPremix Ex Taq II ( Takara ) on a CFX96 PCR system ( Bio - Rad ) . GAPDH was used as a housekeeping gene . The primers are shown in Table 1 . Expression levels were calculated based on the 2 - dCT method by normalizing the values to that of the housekeeping gene GAPDH .

Two hundred microliters of culture medium was added to obtain the cell suspension . After counting , culture medium was added to dilute the cell suspension to 4 (cid:5) 10 4 cells / mL , and 50 μ L of BD Matrigel was added to a 96 - well plate . After being placed in a 37 (cid:3) C incubator for 1 h , the BD Matrigel solidi ﬁ ed . Fifty microliters of the cell suspension ( containing 2000 cells ) was added to the surface of the Matrigel and incubated for 3 h . For the tube formation assay , the cells were stained by live / dead staining ( LIVE / DEAD cell viability kit , Life Technologies ) , then the formation of microtubules was observed under a ﬂ uorescence microscope . For alpha - smag staining , the cells on the matrigel were rinsed with PBS , ﬁ xed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 5 min , washed with PBS , permeated with 0 . 2 % Triton for 30 min , washed with PBS , and sealed with 10 % donkey serum for 1 h . For alpha - smag staining , the cells were incubated with primary anti - alpha - smag antibodies ( 1 : 200 , Abcam ) overnight at 4 (cid:3) C , rinsed in PBS and further stained with FITC - conjugated goat anti - mouse secondary antibodies ( 1 : 200 , Abcam ) . After washing with PBS , the cell nuclei were stained with DAPI . The cells were then viewed by a ﬂ uorescence microscope . 2 . 8 . Statistical analysis The results are presented as the mean (cid:6) SEM for each group . One - way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni ' s multiple comparison test was used to statistically compare the different groups . P values < 0 . 05 were consid - ered statistically signi ﬁ cant . 3 . Results In this study , Mg was coated with a biofunctionalized composite step by step , as illustrated in Fig . 1 . All of the different groups were charac - terized in terms of their morphology , composition , biocompatibility and angiogenic bioactivity . As shown in Fig . 2 , a CDHA coating was ﬁ rst prepared on the surface of Mg discs by hydrothermal treatment . The SEM images showed that the surface of the coating was uneven , and the surface morphology of the coating exhibited nanoneedle topography . The EDS results showed that part of the Ca 2 þ in the coating was replaced with Mg 2 þ and Na þ . The ratio of Ca , Mg and Na to P was approximately 1 . 66 , which is close to the Ca / P ratio in hydroxyapatite ( HA ) . This result is consistent with our previous research [ 39 ] . A nanoscale CDHA coating formed on the Mg disc surfaces by hydrothermal treatment . After the CDHA - Mg was immersed in the dopamine solution , a new coating was formed on the CDHA coat . The EDS results showed a small amount of N ( 2 . 02 atomic % ) in the coating . After soaking DOPA - CDHA - Mg in VEGF solution for 3 h , the surface morphology of the coating did not change much . The EDS results showed that the N element of the coating increased to an atomic % of 4 . 30 . The composition of the coating was analyzed by XPS and FTIR . As shown in Fig . 3a and Table 2 , characteristic P – O and O – H peaks were observed in the Raman spectrum of CDHA - Mg . Newly formed δ ring ( C – H ) , ν PDA ( C – O ) , ν ring ( C – – C ) characteristic peaks were observed at wavenumbers of 896 , 1280 , and 1420 cm (cid:4) 1 in the FTIR pattern after CDHA - Mg was soaked in dopamine and VEGF solution . The XPS wide - scan spectra of CDHA - Mg , DOPA - CDHA - Mg and VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg are shown in Fig . 3b , and their corresponding surface elemental com - positions are shown in Table 3 . The surface of CDHA - Mg was mainly composed of Ca , Mg , O and P . In addition , peaks of C 1s and N 1s were also observed . Carbon was typically present in the wide - scan spectrum of CDHA - Mg due to unavoidable hydrocarbon contamination . The small amount of N may have been attributed to impurities in the HA coating . For DOPA - CDHA - Mg and VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg , the peak intensities of P 2p , P 2s , Ca 2p , Ca 2s and Ca KLL in the DOPA - CDHA - Mg and VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg samples were signi ﬁ cantly decreased , while the peak intensities of C 1s and N 1s were increased . The element content analysis showed the same trend , as the contents of C and N in DOPA - CDHA - Mg were higher than that of CDHA - Mg , and the contents of C and N in VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg were further increased compared with that of DOPA - CDHA - Mg . To con ﬁ rm that VEGF was immobilized on the surface of the sample , immuno ﬂ uorescence and ELISAs were used to qualitatively and quanti - tatively assess the binding of VEGF on the sample surfaces . As shown in Fig . 4a and Fig . 4b , immuno ﬂ uorescence assays con ﬁ rmed that VEGF was bound to the surface of the sample . Fig . 4c showed that before soaking , the concentration of VEGF in the loading solution was 165 . 5 (cid:6) 12 . 1 ng / ml . After soaking , the concentration was decreased to 16 . 4 (cid:6) 4 . 4 ng / ml . The binding ef ﬁ ciency of VEGF to the sample surface reached 90 . 1 % , and the density of VEGF bound on the sample surface was calculated to be approximately 55 . 8 ng / cm 2 . Fig . 5a – c showed the surface morphologies of CDHA - Mg , DOPA - CDHA - Mg and VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg after immersion in SBF solution at 37 (cid:3) C for 14 days . As for CDHA - Mg , some cracks were observed on the surface of CDHA - Mg after immersion in SBF for 14 days . It was observed that a apatite like layer was deposited on the surface of DOPA - CDHA - Mg and VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg at day 14 . The concentration of released Mg 2 þ from CDHA - Mg , DOPA - CDHA - Mg and VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg during immerison in PBS for 14 days was shown in Fig . 5d . It can be seen that the concentration of released Mg 2 þ basically maintained be - tween 50 and 90 ppm . Fig . 5e showed the effects of different coatings on the degradation of Mg discs were characterized by immersion experi - ments in SBF . After hydrothermal treatment , Mg degradation was observed based on a very limited increase in the pH of the SBF . The pH of Fig . 1 . Schematic illustration .

Li et al . Journal of Orthopaedic Translation 30 ( 2021 ) 82 – 92 86 SBF increased from 7 . 25 to 7 . 8 at the initial soaking stage and then decreased again to approximately 7 . 7 . After dopamine ﬁ lm formation and VEGF immobilization , the protection of composite coatings on Mg was further improved . After soaking the samples in SBF for one day , the pH value of the simulated body ﬂ uids increased from 7 . 25 to approxi - mately 7 . 6 and then gradually decreased , and the pH value was basically maintained at approximately 7 . 5 from 7 to 21 days . Moreover , the sta - bility of the VEGF immobilized on the surface of the sample during the immersion experiment was also tested ( Fig . 5 ) . On the ﬁ rst day of the immersion experiment , approximately 21 . 4 % of the VEGF was detached from the sample surface and entered the surrounding immersion me - dium . Subsequently , the amount of VEGF released from the sample surface into the soaking medium decreased rapidly , and the total amount of VEGF released from the sample surface at 21 days was approximately 31 . 2 % , indicating that most of the VEGF was ﬁ rmly immobilized on the sample surface . A CCK - 8 assay was used to evaluate the proliferation of MC3T3 - E1 cells on different coatings . As shown in Fig . 6a , there was no signi ﬁ - cant difference in the cell proliferation on different coatings on the ﬁ rst day . Cell proliferation was signi ﬁ cantly greater in the VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg group than in the DOPA - CDHA - Mg group at 4 days . There was no signi ﬁ cant difference in the cell proliferation between the DOPA - CDHA - Mg and CDHA - Mg groups . On day 7 , there were signi ﬁ cant dif - ferences among all groups in the following order : VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg > DOPA - CDHA - Mg > HA - Mg . Fig . 6b – d shows the ﬂ uorescence im - ages of the attached cells on different coatings subjected to live / dead staining . The cells on different coatings were stained green , but no red color was observed , indicating that the cells on the sample surface were alive . These results veri ﬁ ed the good biocompatibilities of the CDHA coating , DOPA - CDHA coating and VEGF - DOPA - CDHA coating . As shown in Fig . 7a - c , the spreading area of the cells in the VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg group was signi ﬁ cantly larger than that of the other two groups .

To verify the ability of immobilized VEGF to bioactively promote vascularization , immuno ﬂ uorescence was used to characterize the expression of CD31 and vWF antibodies in rBMSCs after culture for 14 days on CDHA - Mg , DOPA - CDHA - Mg and VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg . As shown in Fig . 8 , CD31 and vWF were signi ﬁ cantly expressed in the rBMSCs in the VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg group , while CD31 and vWF expression was basically not observable in the cells of the CDHA - Mg and DOPA - CDHA - Mg groups .

Alpha - smag expression was also observable in the cells of the VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg groups . To further investigate angiogenic differentiation at a molecular level , the mRNA expressions of angiogenesis related genes , including vWF and CD31 , were characterized by qRT - PCR analysis after co - culturing for 7 and 14 days . As shown in Fig . 9d and e , the rBMSCs on the VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg had signi ﬁ - cantly higher vWF and CD31 gene expression on day 7 and day 14 . 4 . Discussion Tissue engineering is a promising method for repairing bone defects larger than critical size [ 40 ] .

Vascularization plays an important role in bone repair and regeneration . Hypovascularization is a major challenge for using tissue engineering methods to repair and regenerate bone defects [ 29 ] . VEGF is often used to promote the formation of blood vessels at defect sites during bone repair , and it is very important for VEGF to be continually active during bone repair [ 26 ] . In this study , Mg was selected as the matrix material for the bone repair tissue engineering scaffold . We ﬁ rst coated a Mg matrix with CDHA and then immobilized VEGF on the surface of CDHA - Mg using dopamine . The HA coating signi ﬁ cantly reduced the initial degradation rate of Mg , thus prohibiting a locally high pH and allowing VEGF to remain biologically active to promote angio - genesis within a certain period of time . There are many reports on the methods for coating Mg with HA [ 35 , 36 , 44 , 45 ] . In this study , a uniform coating of CDHA with high adhesion was prepared on the surface of magnesium metal by water heat treat - ment , and the coating showed a nanoscale topography . The process by which CDHA is coated on Mg by the hydrothermal reaction method is simple to perform , cost a low amount and does not require expensive equipment . Moreover , the hydrothermal reaction process is carried out in a liquid environment , which is very suitable for preparing HA coatings on materials with complex shapes . In this study , a Ca - de ﬁ cient HA coating was obtained , and the CDHA coating was reported to be more conducive to stem cell differentiation into osteoblasts than the HA coating [ 46 ] . Immersion experiments showed that the CDHA coating inhibited the rapid degradation of Mg within the initial three weeks , which is very important for the repair of bone defects . On the one hand , the existence of the CDHA coating avoids the risk of osteolysis caused by excessively high local alkalinity and ensures that stem cells or osteoblasts can adhere , proliferate and differentiate on the surface of Mg in the early stage of implantation . The concentration of Mg 2 þ released from CDHA - Mg , DOPA - CDHA - Mg and VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg during soaking is be - tween 50 and 90 ppm , which is an effective concentration range for Mg 2 þ to play a role in promoting osteogenesis according to the report of Lin et al . [ 47 ] and Zhang et al . [ 48 ] . VEGF is immobilized on the CDHA coating by dopamine , which is a very stable connection mode . The immersion test results showed that approximately 21 . 4 % of the VEGF was released from VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg on the ﬁ rst day of immersion . Some of the released VEGF derived from the failure of dopamine to chemically immobilize on DOPA - CDHA - Mg , and some was derived from the degradation of the CDHA coating , resulting in the release of VEGF immobilized on the coating . From the second day , the amount of VEGF released into the immersion solution signi ﬁ cantly decreased . Within three weeks , the amount of VEGF released into the immersion solution accounted for approximately 31 . 2 % of the amount of VEGF immobilized on VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg , indicating that most of the VEGF was still bound to the surface of VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg , which ensured the continued angiogenic bio - logical activity of VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg . E . Wernike et al . incorporated VEGF into calcium phosphate ceramics by chemical adsorption and codeposition . Within 4 days , the amount of chemically adsorbed VEGF released on the material surface exceeded 80 % , and the cumulative Fig . 8 . Immuno ﬂ uorescence staining of CD31 expression ( a , c , e ) and vWF expression ( b , d , f ) in rBMSCs cultured on CDHA - Mg ( a , b ) ; DOPA - CDHA - Mg ( c , d ) and VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg ( e , f ) after 2 weeks . J . Li et al . Journal of Orthopaedic Translation 30 ( 2021 ) 82 – 92 89 release of VEGF in the codeposition incorporated into the calcium phosphate ceramic surface was 49 . 6 (cid:6) 3 . 7 % within 19 days [ 30 ] . In this study , the amount of VEGF released from VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg at 21 days accounted for approximately 31 . 2 % of the immobilized amount on VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg , and 68 . 8 % of the VEGF was still bound to its surface . The surrounding environment substantially in ﬂ uences the bio - logical activity of VEGF . The rapid degradation of Mg causes the sur - rounding environment to be excessively alkaline , which may lead to the inactivation of VEGF [ 34 ] . In this study , Mg was ﬁ rst coated with CDHA by hydrothermal treatment to reduce the initial degradation rate of Mg and to ensure that the immobilized VEGF maintained its biological ac - tivity at the initial implantation stage . We studied the change in the pH of the immersion solution caused by Mg degradation through immersion experiments . The CDHA coating basically maintained the pH of the im - mersion solution below 7 . 8 . The immobilization of DOPA and VEGF further increased the corrosion resistance of Mg and maintained the pH of SBF below 7 . 5 , which is a mild environment for VEGF and is conducive to the maintenance of its bioactivity . To verify that immobilized VEGF still has good biocompatibility , we studied the adhesion , proliferation and differentiation behaviors of rBMSCs on CDHA - Mg , DOPA - CDHA - Mg and VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg in vitro . The live / dead staining results showed no dead cells on the surfaces of CDHA - Mg , DOPA - CDHA - Mg and VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg , and all three coatings exhibited excellent biocompatibility . The CCK - 8 and adhesion experimental results showed that DOPA and VEGF immobilization further improved the adhesion and proliferation of MC3T3 - E1 cells on DOPA - CDHA - Mg and VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg . Liu et al . prepared a PDA coating on the surface of a Mg – Zn – Y - Nd alloy , which signi ﬁ cantly improved the adhesion and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle endothelial cells on the surface of the Mg alloy [ 49 ] . The improvements in cell adhesion and proliferation on the HF - PDA - treated Mg alloy surface was attributed to the surface chemistry of the DOPA coating . The DOPA coating has abundant functional moieties , which have a good af ﬁ nity for many adhesion - related proteins and nutrients in the culture medium [ 50 ] . This property promotes the adhesion and proliferation of the cells on the DOPA coating . In this study , the DOPA coating provided binding sites for the adhesion of MC3T3 - E1 cells by adsorbing cell adhesion - related proteins ( such as vitronectin and ﬁ bronectin ) to improve cell adhesion . At the same time , the DOPA coating was condu - cive to the enrichment of nutrients in the medium on the coating surface , which promoted cell proliferation . The CCK - 8 results showed that the proliferation of MC3T3 - E1 cells on VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg was superior to that on DOPA - CDHA - Mg . The effect of VEGF on promoting the pro - liferation of primary human osteoblasts has been reported . U . Mayr - Wuhlfart et al . found that VEGF can promote the proliferation of primary human osteoblasts within the range of 0 . 1 – 100 ng / ml in vitro [ 51 ] . VEGF regulates cell proliferation via the VEGFR - 2 receptor on the cell membrane . The signal - transducing receptor VEGFR - 2 is expressed on the cell membrane of osteoblasts and primary osteoblastic cells . The purpose of this study was to immobilize VEGF on Mg to enable its biological ability to induce angiogenesis . The conformational change in VEGF immobilization on Mg and the local alkaline environment gener - ated by Mg degradation may affect the biological activity of VEGF in angiogenesis . Chye Khoon Poh et al . immobilized VEGF on Ti via Fig . 9 .

J . Li et al . Journal of Orthopaedic Translation 30 ( 2021 ) 82 – 92 90 dopamine and veri ﬁ ed that DOPA - immobilized VEGF still had angio - genic bioactivity [ 33 ] . The DOPA - CDHA coating had a signi ﬁ cant pro - tective effect on Mg , and the pH value of the immersion solution was controlled within 21 days at approximately 7 . 5 , which is a relatively mild environment for VEGF . After 14 days of rBMSC culture on CDHA - Mg , DOPA - CDHA - Mg and VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg , rBMSCs grown on CDHA - Mg , DOPA - CDHA - Mg and VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg for 2 weeks were seeded onto a Matrigel surface . The rBMSCs from VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg formed a capillary network after 3 h of incuba - tion on Matrigel ( Fig . 9 ) , and the rBMSCs from DOPA - CDHA - Mg and CDHA - Mg did not form any capillary network and remained isolated as single cells on the Matrigel . The endothelial cell markers vWF and CD31 were examined to con ﬁ rm that the rBMSCs on VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg indeed differentiated into endothelial cells . As shown in Fig . 8 , the differentiated cells expressed strong vWF and CD31 after 2 weeks of culture on VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg , while the differentiated cells rarely expressed vWF and CD31 after 2 weeks of culture on DOPA - CDHA - Mg and CDHA - Mg . The qRT - PCR results were consistent with the immuno - ﬂ uorescence results . After 7 and 14 days of coculture , the expression of angiogenesis - related genes in differentiated cells on VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg was signi ﬁ cantly higher than that in cells of the DOPA - CDHA - Mg and CDHA - Mg groups . Thus , the results further con ﬁ rm that VEGF immobilized on VEGF - DOPA - CDHA - Mg retains its angiogenic bioactivity and may mediate endothelial differentiation . 5 . Conclusion The osteogenesis of Mg 2 þ is a major advantage of the use of Mg - based metallic biomaterials as tissue engineering scaffold materials . Angio - genesis de ﬁ ciency is a key problem that urgently needs to be solved in regards to the use of tissue engineering methods to repair bone defects . In this study , we enabled the angiogenic biological activity of Mg by immobilizing VEGF on Mg . Mg was successfully coated with a functional VEGF - DOPA - CDHA composite coating . The CDHA coating signi ﬁ cantly increased the corrosion resistance of Mg and prohibited the negative effect of excessively high local alkalinity on the biological activity of VEGF . As an intermediate layer , the DOPA coating protects Mg , and DOPA provides a binding site for VEGF so that VEGF can be ﬁ rmly immobilized on Mg and give Mg angiogenic bioactivity during the initial period of implantation .
