However , it is still not fully 25 understood how alternatively spliced genes develop the functional novelty . To this 26 end , we infer the evolutionary history of the doublesex gene , the key transcriptional 27 factor in the sexual differentiation of arthropods . doublesex is controlled by sex - 28 specific splicing and promotes both male and female differentiation in some 29 holometabolan insects . In contrast , doublesex promotes only male differentiation in 30 some hemimetabolan insects . Here , we investigate ancestral states of doublesex using 31 Thermobia domestica belonging to Zygentoma , the sister group of winged insects . We 32 find that doublesex of T . domestica expresses sex - specific isoforms but is only 33 necessary for male differentiation of sexual morphology . This result ensures the 34 hypothesis that doublesex was initially only used to promote male differentiation 35 during insect evolution . However , T . domestica doublesex has a short female - specific 36 region and upregulates the expression of vitellogenin homologs in females , suggesting 37 that doublesex may have already controlled some aspects of feminization in the 38 common ancestor of winged insects . Reconstruction of the ancestral sequence and 39 prediction of the protein structure show that the female - specific isoform of doublesex 40 has a long C - terminal disordered region in holometabolan insects , but not in non - 41 holometabolan species . We propose that doublesex acquired a female - specific isoform 42 and then underwent a change in the protein motif structure , which became essential 43 for female differentiation in sexual dimorphisms . 44 Keywords : sexual differentiation , alternative splicing , doublesex , insect , 45 Zygentoma 46 3 47 Introduction 48 Sexual reproduction is widely used for transmitting genetic information from 49 one to the next generation in Metazoa . For reproductive success , animals evolved 50 diverse sex differences , i . e . , sexual dimorphism , in morphology ( Darwin 1871 ; 51 Geddes and Thomson 1889 ) which underlie eco - evolutionary dynamics such as 52 extinction rate and interspecific interaction ( Fryxell et al . 2019 ) . In the last three 53 decades , the genetic pathways that create sex and sexual dimorphism have been 54 elucidated in many animal species . Surprisingly , despite having a single origin 55 ( Beukeboom and Perrin 2014 ) , these pathways have undergone extensive changes 56 during animal evolution ( Wilkins 1995 ; Bachtrog et al . 2014 ; Bopp et al . 2014 ; 57 Herpin and Schartl 2015 ) . 58 The diversity has been attributed to differences in the composition of the 59 regulatory cascades . For example , in eutherians such as mice and humans , the master 60 regulator of sex is Sex - determining region Y ( Sry ) , a member of the High Mobility 61 Group ( HMG ) - box transcriptional factor family ( Gubbay et al . 1990 ; Sinclair et al . 62 1990 ; Koopman et al . 1991 ; Miyawaki et al . 2020 ) , while DM domain gene on the Y 63 chromosome ( dmy ) of the doublesex and mab - 3 related transcriptional factor ( DMRT ) 64 family is the master sex - determining regulator in the medaka fish ( Matsuda et al . 65 2002 ; Nanda et al . 2002 ) . Diversification of the pathway governing sex 66 determination / differentiation are largely based on differences in their gene repertoires 67 ( e . g . , Hasselmann et al . 2008 ; Hattori et al . 2010 ; Sato et al . 2010 ; Takehana et al . 68 2014 ) . In contrast , it has recently been discovered that the mechanisms of sexual 69 4 differentiation in Pterygota , i . e . , winged insects , differ in outputs of the gene cascade , 70 e . g . , the promotion masculinization or feminization . 71 Sexually dimorphic morphology in Pterygota is formed during postembryonic 72 development . doublesex ( dsx ) , a member of the DMRT family , acts as a global 73 regulator at the bottom of the cascade to govern over sex differentiation ( Kopp , 2012 ; 74 Verhulst and van de Zande , 2015 ) . In many pterygote insects studied , dsx is controlled 75 by sex - specific splicing . In Diptera , Coleoptera , and Lepidoptera , sex - specific Dsx 76 protein variants are essential for promoting either male or female differentiation in 77 sexual dimorphism ( e . g . , Hildreth 1965 ; Burtis and Baker 1989 ; Ohbayashi et al . 78 2001 ; Kijimoto et al . 2012 ; Ito et al . 2013 ; Shukla and Palli 2012 ; Gotoh et al . 2016 ; 79 Xu et al . 2017 ) . For example , in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster , dsx is required 80 to realize sex differences in external genitalia and foreleg bristle rows , while dsx 81 mutants show an intersexual phenotype in these traits because both male and female 82 differentiation are inhibited ( Hildreth and Lucchesi 1963 ; Hildreth 1965 ) . However , in 83 the sawfly Athalia rosae ( Mine et al . 2017 , 2021 ) , the silverleaf whitefly Bemisia 84 tabaci ( Guo et al . 2018 ) , the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens ( Zhuo et al . 85 2018 ) , the German cockroach Blattella germanica ( Wexler et al . 2019 ) , and the 86 damselfly Ischnura senegalensis ( Takahashi et al . 2019 , 2021 ) , dsx has sex - specific 87 isoforms and is responsible for male differentiation of morphological traits during 88 postembryonic development , but not needed for female differentiation . Thus , despite 89 expressing sex - specific isoforms , dsx ’s role in sexual differentiation in Pterygota is 90 different , as it controls both male and female differentiation or only male 91 differentiation for sexual morphogenesis . 92 5 dsx in crustaceans and arachnids is reported to be highly expressed in males 93 without sex - specific isoforms ( Kato et al . 2011 ; Pomerantz et al . 2015 ; Li et al . 2018 ; 94 Panara et al . 2019 ) . Accordingly , dsx is only required for male differentiation of 95 morphological traits in the water flea Daphnia magna . Wexler et al . ( 2019 ) proposed 96 a stepwise evolution in which dsx had acquired sex - specific isoforms and later had 97 become essential for female differentiation . However , roles of dsx are more diverse 98 than expected . In Hymenoptera , dsx is involved in female differentiation of 99 reproductive organs in the honeybee Apis mellifera ( Roth et al . 2019 ) , while dsx is 100 non - essential for female differentiation in the sawfly At . rosae ( Mine et al . 2017 , 101 2021 ) . In the milkweed bug Oncopeltus fasciatus , dsx is involved in both female and 102 male differentiation of the genital organs ( Just et al . 2021 ) . dsx in Be . tabaci positively 103 regulates the expression of a yolk precursor gene vitellogenin in females while it is 104 not essential for female morphology ( Guo et al . 2018 ) , implying that dsx has different 105 functionality for morphogenesis and otherwise in females . Overall , estimating the 106 evolutionary history of dsx in Pterygota is still a challenging task . Also , it is unclear 107 what factors led to the feminizing roles of dsx ( Hopkins and Kopp 2021 ) . 108 The phylogenetic distance between crustaceans and Pterygota and the lack of 109 information about outgroups more closely related to Pterygota may be the reason for 110 the gap of understanding of how dsx evolved from a monofunctional to a bifunctional 111 regulator in arthropods . In an attempt to close this gap , we decided to include the 112 firebrat Thermobia domestica ( Zygentoma ) in our analysis of dsx . Zygentoma is the 113 sister group of Pterygota ( Misof et al . 2014 ) , does not copulate , and displays simple 114 sexual dimorphisms , i . e . , non - aedeagus male penises and female ovipositors 115 ( Kristensen 1975 ; Matsuda 1976 ; Emeljanov 2014 ; Beutel et al . 2017 ; Boudinot 116 6 2018 ) . Otherwise , there is little difference in morphology between females and males , 117 as Darwin ( 1871 : 348 ) noted , " The sexes do not differ . " These features suggest that 118 the level of sex differentiation in this species is very simple and likely to be ancestral . 119 Thus , Zygentoma presents an ideal model for investigating the ancestral state of dsx in 120 Pterygota . In this study , we investigated dsx in T . domestica and analyzed its 121 functions in sexual differentiation . Also , we carried out the phylogenetic analysis , 122 ancestral sequence reconstruction , and protein structure prediction to infer the 123 evolutionary history of dsx . 124 125 Results and Discussion 126 Molecular evolution of dsx homologs and gene duplication of dsx in insects 127 Five doublesex ( dsx ) homologs were found in the transcriptome database of 128 the firebrat Thermobia domestica . To identify which of them corresponds to the dsx 129 ortholog in T . domestica , we compared these to dsx homologs found in 130 transcriptome / genome / protein databases of various arthropods and vertebrates 131 ( supplementary table 1 ) and performed molecular phylogenetic analyses based on the 132 amino acid sequences of their DNA - binding domains . As a result , the pancrustacean 133 dsx was grouped into a distinct clade from the other DMRT family genes ( fig . 1A ) . 134 Within this clade , four subclades were recognized : Insect Dsx Clade 1 , Insect Dsx 135 Clade 2 , Entognatha Dsx Clade , and Crustacea Dsx Clade . Insect Dsx Clade 1 136 contained the dsx found in Pterygota including Drosophila melanogaster . This clade 137 also contained one of the 5 dsx homologs of T . domestica . We consider it likely that 138 this dsx homolog is the corresponding ortholog of T . domestica . This Entognatha Dsx 139 7 Clade also contained dsx from a springtail ( Collembola ) and a dipluran insect 140 ( Diplura ) . The Crustacea Dsx Clade contained dsx from branchiopods , including 141 daphnids . 142 We found that several species of Zygentoma , Ephemeroptera ( mayflies ) , and 143 Phasmatodea ( stick insects ) contain a dsx - like homolog of the Insect Dsx Clade 2 ( fig . 144 1A , B ) as well as the dsx ortholog of the Insect Dsx Clade 1 . These findings indicate 145 that dsx was duplicated before the divergence of Zygentoma and that the two paralogs 146 retained from the divergence of the pterygote insects until at least the divergence of 147 Eumetabola ( = Hemiptera + Thysanoptera + Psocodea + Holometabola ) . The 148 molecular evolution of dsx has been inferred from dsx of some pterygote insects , 149 mainly holometabolan insects ( Wexler et al . 2014 ; Mawaribuchi et al . 2019 ) , while 150 the presence of a dsx - like gene may have been overlooked in their analyses . Here , we 151 report that the genome of T . domestica also contains both dsx and dsx - like , reflecting 152 the presumed ancestral state in Pterygota in terms of gene copy number of dsx . Gene 153 duplication generally leads to neo - / sub - functionalization to allow functional 154 diversification ( c . f . , Taylor and Raes 2004 ) . In this study , we analyzed the expression 155 profiles and functions of dsx as well as dsx - like in T . domestica . 156 157 8 FIG . 1 .

The expression level ( D and F ) was measured by the RT - qPCR of dsx 175 and dsx - like in the adult fat body and is indicated as the relative values to the 176 expression of the reference gene , ribosomal protein 49 ( rp49 ) . Each plot indicates the 177 mRNA expression level of each individual . Total N = 20 ( dsx male - type ) , 23 ( dsx 178 female - type ) , and 24 ( dsx - like ) . Results of Brunner – Munzel tests are indicated by 179 asterisks : * * P < 0 . 01 ; * * * P < 0 . 001 and are described in supplementary table 2 . 180 181 Sex - specific splicing of dsx in Thermobia domestica 182 Splicing of dsx produces gives rise to sex - specific isoforms in all pterygote 183 insects studied thus far , with the exception of the termite Reticulitermes speratus 184 ( Miyazaki et al . 2021 ) , the silverleaf whitefly Bemisia tabaci ( Guo et al . 2018 ) , and 185 the body louse Pediculus humanus ( Wexler et al . 2019 ) , suggesting that sex - specific 186 splicing regulation of dsx was acquired before the divergence of Pterygota . To 187 examine this hypothesis , we investigated the expression profile of dsx and dsx - like of 188 T . domestica . Full - length mRNA sequences of dsx - like and dsx in T . domestica were 189 determined by the RNA - seq and rapid amplification of cDNA ends ( RACE ) methods . 190 Then , we investigated the gene structures to map the mRNA sequences to our genome 191 database . dsx consists of five exons with two isoforms ( fig . 1C ) : a long one ( 951 bp ) 192 and a short one ( 756 bp ) . RT - qPCR analysis showed that the long isoform and the 193 short isoform were highly expressed in males and females , respectively ( fig . 1D ; 194 Brunner - Munzel test , P = 1 . 75×10 - 6 and 2 . 20×10 - 16 in the long and the short 195 isoforms ) . This fact indicates that dsx is controlled by sex - specific splicing . We refer 196 to the male - biased isoform as dsx male - type and the female - biased isoform as dsx 197 female - type . The dsx - like is expressed about two - fold higher in males than in females 198 ( Brunner - Munzel test , P = 0 . 00924 ) and has three exons but no sex - specific isoform 199 ( fig . 1E , F ) , showing that dsx - like is not regulated by sex - specific splicing . 200 Our results give the further support that sex - specific splicing of dsx already 201 existed in the common ancestor of Pterygota and Zygentoma ( = Dicondylia ) , which 202 10 diverged ~ 421 million years ago ( Ma ) . Misof et al . ( 2014 ) estimated that the common 203 ancestor of Daphnia and hexapods occurred at ~ 508 Ma . Therefore , dsx sex - specific 204 splicing regulation is an ancient feature of insects that was acquired between 508 and 205 421 Ma and has been conserved for ~ 400 million years in each taxon of Dicondylia . 206 207 Function of dsx for internal reproductive system and body size in T . domestica 208 Deciphering the role of dsx of T . domestica is essential for inferring the 209 ancestral roles of dsx in pterygote insects . Hence , we conducted a functional analysis 210 of not only dsx but also dsx - like since this paralog might also play a role in sexual 211 differentiation . 212 To this end , we silenced dsx and dsx - like by RNA interference ( RNAi ) . We 213 quantified the expression of dsx and dsx - like in fat bodies of RNAi individuals by 214 reverse transcriptional quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( RT - qPCR ) . dsx 215 silencing in females and dsx - like silencing in both sexes showed significantly 216 decreased expression of each target genes compared to their expression in enhanced 217 green fluorescent protein ( egfp ) RNAi controls ( Brunner - Munzel test , P = 0 . 0265 in 218 female dsx , 4 . 40×10 - 16 in male and female dsx - like ; supplementary fig . 1A ; 219 supplementary table 2 ) . The dsx RNAi males did not show a significant effect on dsx 220 expression . Since it was suspected that outliers affected this result , we tested for 221 outliers in dsx RNAi males and found one outlier ( supplementary table 3 ) . The 222 reanalysis removing the outlier showed that dsx expression was significantly 223 decreased in dsx RNAi males ( Brunner - Munzel test , P = 0 . 00545 ; supplementary fig . 224 1B ; supplementary table 2 ) . Therefore , we concluded that dsx and dsx - like dsRNAs 225 can knock down each target gene . Also , dsx RNAi had no effect on dsx - like 226 expression and vice versa . 227 11 We also performed a double knockdown of dsx and dsx - like , to address the 228 possibility that dsx and dsx - like are redundant . We specifically examined the effects of 229 silencing on sexual dimorphism such as body size ( fig . 2A ) and reproductive systems . 230 The body size , as measured by the pronotum width , was not affected in either 231 knockdown group ( fig . 2B ; supplementary table 4 , 5 ) . In the gonads , the dsx RNAi , 232 dsx - like RNAi , and double knockdown did not show any histological differences in 233 testes , ovaries , and gametogenesis from the controls ( fig . 2C ; Supplementary Material 234 online ) . On the other hand , in the dsx knockdown group ( dsx alone or dsx and dsx - 235 like ) , the male seminal vesicle , which is a sperm storage organ and normally has a 236 bean pod shape , became rounded ( fig . 2D ) . The number of sperm in the seminal 237 vesicles of dsx RNAi males was lower than in the control group ( fig . 2E ; 238 supplementary table 5 ; generalized linear model , P = 0 . 00487 ) . Silencing of dsx or 239 dsx - like or both did not affect normal differentiation of the female reproductive 240 systems including the spermatheca ( fig . 2F ; supplementary fig . 2 ; Supplementary 241 Material online ) . Also , there was no effect on the number of oocytes in any treatments 242 ( fig . 2G ; supplementary table 4 ) . 243 The lack of effect of RNAi on the gonads may be due to the timing of the 244 RNAi treatment , which was performed after gonadal differentiation . This is supported 245 by a previous study ( Klag 1977 ) suggesting that sex differences in gonads and germ 246 cells are produced during embryogenesis . Embryonic RNAi is necessary to test this 247 hypothesis , although , this experiment will be left to future studies , as our study 248 focuses on the function of dsx during postembryonic development . The lack of effect 249 of dsx on the body size of T . domestica is consistent with studies in D . melanogaster 250 ( Hildreth 1965 ; Rideout et al . 2015 ) . The effect on internal reproductive systems other 251 12 than the gonads are consistent with results in Athalia rosae ( Mine et al . 2017 , 2021 ) 252 and Blattella germanica ( Wexler et al . 2019 ) . 253 254 FIG . 2 .

Scales : 50 µm ( C ) ; 10 µm ( E ) ; 1000 µm ( D and F ) . 287 288 289 Function of dsx for morphology in genital organs of T . domestica and evolution of 290 the function of dsx for sexual morphogenesis in insects 291 The sexually dimorphic morphology can be seen in the external genital organs , 292 i . e . , male penis and female ovipositor ( fig . 3A ) . Males of T . domestica have unpaired 293 small external genitalia on the abdominal segment IX . Females have an ovipositor 294 consisted of two paired appendage - like structure on the abdominal segment VIII and 295 IX . Males of the dsx knockdown groups ( dsx only and both dsx and dsx - like RNAi ) 296 was transformed into two pairs of appendage - like structures resembling the female 297 ovipositor ( fig . 3B , C ; Supplementary Material online ) . This effect was not observed 298 14 in dsx - like RNAi males . Our results indicate that dsx is essential for male 299 differentiation of morphological traits in T . domestica . In contrast to males , our 300 analysis showed that none of the RNAi treatments affected female ovipositors at 301 external morphological , tissue , or cellular levels ( fig . 3D , E ; supplementary fig . 3 ; 302 Supplementary Material online ) . We then measured the length of the female 303 ovipositor in the RNAi - treated groups to examine the involvement of dsx and dsx - like 304 in the growth of female morphology . The results showed that dsx and dsx - like RNAi 305 had no significant effect on ovipositor length ( fig . 3F , G ; supplementary table 4 ) . 306 The lack of effect of dsx RNAi in females is due to that dsx is not essential for 307 female differentiation of morphology during postembryonic development or that dsx 308 knockdown is inefficient in the females . Compared to the knockdown efficiency of 309 dsx in the males ( ~ 30 % at median ) , that in the females is ~ 50 % ( supplementary table 310 2 ) . However , given that half of the female individuals in the RT - qPCR analysis in the 311 fat body had lower dsx expression than the minimum value of the control ones 312 ( supplementary fig . 1A ) , it can be assumed that dsx expression is suppressed in a 313 certain number of females used in each analysis . In addition , dsx RNAi showed no 314 effect on morphology in all 58 females ( 80 females including dsx and dsx - like double 315 RNAi ) analyzed in this study . Thus , it is reasonable to conclude that dsx is not 316 essential for female differentiation of morphology during postembryonic development 317 in T . domestica . Also , our results indicate that dsx - like is not essential for the sexual 318 differentiation of morphology during postembryonic development in T . domestica . 319 The knockdown of both dsx and dsx - like showed only the same effect as dsx RNAi 320 alone . Thus , it is unlikely that dsx - like functions redundantly with dsx . 321 Sexual morphology , e . g . , reproductive systems and genital organs , formed 322 during postembryonic development is controlled by dsx in males but is dsx - 323 15 independent in females of non - holometabolan insects such as T . domestica 324 ( Zygentoma : this study ) , Bl . germanica ( Dictyoptera : Wexler et al . 2019 ) and the 325 brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens ( Hemiptera : Zhuo et al . 2018 ) . There could be 326 the possibility of tissue - specific effects of dsx found in some holometabolan females 327 ( e . g . , Ledón - Rettig et al . 2017 ) . However , this possibility would be unlikely at least in 328 these species since dsx was knocked down by systematic RNAi and was not reported 329 to affect female morphology at this time . Based on these facts , we estimate that dsx 330 may not be essential for female differentiation of morphology at the common ancestor 331 of Dicondylia , ensuring the hypothesis proposed by Wexler et al . ( 2019 ) . 332 To elucidate the timing of the acquisition of the role of dsx in female 333 morphogenesis during postembryonic development , we must interpret the role of dsx 334 in Hymenoptera , the basal clade of Holometabola . Studies in the honeybee Apis 335 mellifera showed through genome editing that dsx controls female differentiation of 336 the internal reproductive system under worker nutrition conditions ( Roth et al . 2019 ) . 337 In the honeybee , sex differences in the gonads are established during embryogenesis 338 ( Lago et al . 2020 ) . Thus , the male - like reproductive organ in dsx mutant females in 339 Roth et al . ( 2019 ) would show an effect during embryogenesis , not during 340 postembryonic development . We cannot conclude whether dsx is not essential for 341 female morphogenesis in the honeybee , since the information on the roles of dsx in 342 sexual morphology is limited to gonads and heads of the worker females . However , 343 given that dsx does not affect heads in Ap . mellifera females ( Roth et al . 2019 ) , wings 344 in the parasitoid wasp Nasonia vitripennis females ( Wang et al . 2020 ) , and sexual 345 traits in At . rosae females ( Mine et al . 2017 , 2021 ) , at this time , it is reasonable to 346 infer that dsx was not essential for female morphogenesis during postembryonic 347 development in the common ancestor of Hymenoptera . This interpretation and the 348 16 essential roles of dsx for female development in the other holometabolan insects 349 suggest that dsx became essential for feminization of morphology during 350 postembryonic development at the common ancestor of holometabolan insects except 351 for Hymenoptera ( = Aparaglossata ) emerging ~ 327 Ma . 352 353 FIG . 3 .

Scales : 1 cm ( B and D ) ; 50 377 µm ( C and E ) . 378 379 Cryptic role of doublesex for female - specific transcripts in T . domestica and its 380 opposite role between sexes 381 dsx in T . domestica does not seem to have conflicting functions between sexes 382 in postembryonic morphogenesis . On the other hand , other biological processes 383 remain to be considered . We tested whether dsx contributes to the expression of 384 vitellogenin ( vtg ) , a yolk protein precursor gene that is highly expressed in animal 385 females ( Byrne et al . 1989 ; Hayward et al . 2010 ) . Previous studies have shown that 386 vtg in pterygote insects is controlled by dsx ( e . g . , Suzuki et al . 2003 ; Shukla and Palli 387 2012 ; Thongsaiklaing et al . 2018 ) . Our RNA - seq analysis showed that three vtg 388 homologs , i . e . , vtg1 , vtg2 , and vtg3 , were expressed female - specifically in the fat body 389 in T . domestica ( supplementary fig . 4 ; supplementary table 6 ) . We analyzed the 390 expression of vtg in the fat bodies of dsx , dsx - like , or both genes RNAi groups by RT - 391 qPCR . 392 In dsx RNAi males , all vtg mRNAs were expressed 45 – 1530 - fold higher than 393 the controls ( fig . 4A ; supplementary table 2 : Brunner - Munzel test , P = 2 . 87×10 - 8 , 394 18 6 . 60×10 - 16 and 2 . 80×10 - 4 in vtg1 , vtg2 , and vtg3 ) . vtg1 and vtg3 mRNAs were 395 significantly up - regulated in dsx - like RNAi males compared to the controls ( fig . 4A : 396 Brunner - Munzel test , P = 0 . 0139 and 0 . 00497 in vtg1 and vtg3 ) . In both dsx and dsx - 397 like RNAi males , the effect was similar to that in dsx RNAi males ( fig . 4A : Brunner - 398 Munzel test , P = 6 . 60×10 - 16 , 0 . 0162 , and 6 . 60×10 - 16 in vtg1 , vtg2 , and vtg3 ) . Then , we 399 found that the expression of all vtg genes was significantly reduced in dsx RNAi 400 females ( fig . 4B ; supplementary table 2 : Brunner - Munzel test , P = 0 . 0433 , 0 . 00422 , 401 and 0 . 00623 in vtg1 , vtg2 , and vtg3 ) . This reduction rate was approximately 0 . 2 – 0 . 4 - 402 fold . Furthermore , vtg expression was significantly reduced in dsx - like RNAi females 403 ( Brunner - Munzel test , P = 0 . 00256 , 3 . 80×10 - 6 , and 1 . 49×10 - 5 in vtg1 , vtg2 , and vtg3 ) 404 and both dsx and dsx - like RNAi females ( Brunner - Munzel test , P = 0 . 0305 , 0 . 00892 , 405 and 0 . 0197 in vtg1 , vtg2 , and vtg3 ) ( fig . 4B ) . These results show that dsx and dsx - like 406 of T . domestica control vtg negatively in males and positively in females . 407 Our results indicate that dsx has opposite roles between sexes , i . e . , repressive 408 in males and promotive in females , in vtg expression . dsx - like also has the opposite 409 functions for vtg expression in males and females . It is unlikely that this result is due 410 to dsx - like regulating dsx transcription , as dsx - like did not affect dsx expression 411 ( supplementary fig . 1A ) . A possible hypothesis is that dsx - like might regulate vtg 412 expression as one of the co - regulators that bind dsx or other transcription factors . 413 We do not know whether dsx of T . domestica oppositely controls genes other 414 than the vtg homologs between sexes since our analysis was limited to vtg homologs . 415 However , the results from these genes indicates that the molecular function of dsx in 416 this species includes the opposite function for some genes’ transcription in females 417 and males . In Be . tabaci , dsx positively regulates vtg expression in females , even 418 though it is not essential for female differentiation of morphological traits ( Guo et al . 419 19 2018 ) . dsx of this species does not negatively regulate vtg in males . Therefore , the 420 functionality of dsx found in T . domestica , i . e . , the opposing role in some genes’ 421 expression between sexes and the function that are not essential for female 422 morphogenesis , is a functionality that has not been reported in any insect or animal . 423 This functionality indicates that even if dsx can oppositely function for some genes’ 424 expression between sexes , it does not necessarily have opposite functions in 425 morphogenesis between sexes . This difference in the functionality might be due to 426 differences in genes under dsx control between morphogenesis and other aspects such 427 as the yolk synthesis in females . 428 Genes under dsx control in males are dsx - free in females of I . senegalensis 429 ( Takahashi et al . 2021 ) , Bl . germanica ( Wexler et al . 2019 ; Pei et al . 2021 ) , and Ni . 430 lugens ( Zhuo et al . 2018 ) . It was thought that feminizing roles of dsx in 431 morphogenesis and other biological processes may have appeared in the common 432 ancestor of Aparaglossata ( or Holometabola ) as an entirely novel function , i . e . , 433 neofunctionalization . In contrast , the contribution of dsx to some genes’ expression in 434 females of T . domestica ( this study ) , Be . tabaci ( Guo et al . 2018 ) , Ap . mellifera 435 ( Velasque et al . 2018 ) and Aparaglossata raises the alternative hypothesis that the 436 ability of dsx to be involved in female differentiation was already present in the 437 common ancestor of Dicondylia and later became essential for the female 438 morphogenesis in the common ancestor of Aparaglossata . In this evolutionary 439 scenario , the role of dsx in the feminization of postembryonic morphogenesis in 440 Aparaglossata could be due to extending its capability to control some genes in 441 females , i . e . , functional expansion . We cannot decide which of these hypotheses is 442 appropriate , at this time . However , the latter scenario can well explain the presence of 443 female - specific coding sequences of dsx and high expression of dsx female - type 444 20 during postembryonic development , in non - aparaglossatan insects . The capability to 445 regulate some female genes might be a “minor function” of dsx in non - holometabolan 446 females predicted by Wexler et al . ( 2019 ) . 447 448 FIG . 4 . Function of doublesex for vitellogenin expression in Thermobia domestica . 449 ( A ) vitellogenin expression level in RNAi males . ( B ) vitellogenin expression level in 450 RNAi females . The mRNA expression levels were measured by the RT - qPCR 451 analysis . The figures show the log - scale relative values of the expression level of 452 three vitellogenin homologs to the reference gene , ribosomal protein 49 ( rp49 ) . Each 453 plot indicates the mRNA expression level of each individual . In each panel , the egfp , 454 dsx all , dsx - lik e and dsx + dsx - like indicates the egfp dsRNA injected group ( control ) , 455 dsx sex - common region dsRNA injected group , dsx - like dsRNA injected group , and 456 both dsx sex - common region and dsx - like dsRNAs injected group , respectively . The 457 Brunner - Munzel test method were performed to statistically analyze the difference in 458 mRNA expression level between the control and the dsx or dsx - like RNAi groups . The 459 P - values were adjusted by the Holm’s method . * P < 0 . 05 , * * P < 0 . 001 , * * * P < 0 . 0001 . P 460 ≥ 0 . 05 is not shown . The statistical results were described in supplementary table 2 . 461 21 Total N = 30 ( vitellogenin - 1 ) , 24 ( vitellogenin - 2 ) and 39 ( vitellogenin - 3 ) in males and 462 33 ( vitellogenin - 1 ) , 33 ( vitellogenin - 2 ) , and 34 ( vitellogenin - 3 ) in females . 463 464 Evolution of C - terminus disordered region of dsx female - type 465 One of the puzzling problems is how dsx became recruited for female 466 differentiation of morphological traits ( cf . , Hopkins and Kopp 2021 ) . Here , we found 467 that the C - terminal sequences including the oligomerization ( OD ) domain of the dsx 468 female - type is much shorter in T . domestica ( 38 aa ) than that in D . melanogaster ( 53 469 aa ) ( supplementary fig . 5 ) . The OD domain is essential for female differentiation in D . 470 melanogaster , as it physically binds to dsx itself , transcription factors , and co - 471 activators ( An and Wensink 1995 ; Erdman 1996 ; Ghosh et al . 2019 ; Romero - Pozuelo 472 et al . 2019 ) . Therefore , we hypothesized that the additive region found in D . 473 melanogaster occurred at the common ancestor of Aparaglossata in which dsx became 474 essential for female morphogenesis . To test this hypothesis , we obtained sequences of 475 dsx female - type from 48 insect species based on the National Center for 476 Biotechnology Information ( NCBI ) protein / transcriptome shotgun assembly database 477 and previous studies ( supplementary table 7 ) and reconstructed ancestral sequences of 478 dsx female - type . Our ancestral sequence reconstruction revealed that the C - terminal 479 16 - amino acid region of dsx female - type found in the common ancestor of 480 Aparaglossata was absent in the common ancestor of the other taxon ( fig . 5A ; 481 supplementary fig . 6 ; supplementary table 8 ) . This motif is conserved within 482 Aparaglossata in our dataset although moderate sequence diversification was observed 483 ( supplementary fig . 6 ) . In our dataset , almost all sequences of this motif were not 484 found in species in which dsx is not essential for the female differentiation of 485 morphological traits during postembryonic development . Exceptionally , dsx of At . 486 rosae had an amino acid sequence in the region corresponding to this motif , but our 487 22 results of ancestral sequence reconstruction showed that this sequence was acquired in 488 parallel with Aparaglossata . 489 The Aparaglossata - specific region is located in the distal ( C - terminal ) part of 490 the female - specific region in D . melanogaster . This distal region is a disordered 491 region , i . e . , a mobile region that lacks a fixed structure , following an α - helix loop in 492 the proximal ( N - terminal side ) region ( Yang et al . 2008 ) . To investigate whether the 493 acquisition of the disordered region occurred in Aparaglossata , we predicted the 494 protein structure of dsx female - type ancestral sequences of Pterygota , Neoptera , 495 Eumetabola , Holometabola , and Aparaglossata . According to the Alphafold2 496 algorism - based structure prediction , the female - specific region of dsx in the common 497 ancestor of Aparaglossata had a proximal α - helix loop structure , and a distal random 498 coil indicating a disordered region ( fig . 5B ) . This structure was similar to that of D . 499 melanogaster determined by a crystal structural analysis ( Yang et al . 2008 ) . The 500 proximal α - helix loop structure was also predicted in the common ancestors of taxon 501 other than Aparaglossata . The random coil following the α - helix structure was 502 predicted in all common ancestors , but its length was shorter than that of the common 503 ancestor of Aparaglossata . It is essential to determine the structure via nuclear 504 magnetic resonance or cryo - electron microscopy methods to conclude the details at 505 the structural level , although , our theoretical predictions suggest that the disordered 506 region following the α - helix structure in the female - specific region may have been 507 extended in the common ancestor of Aparaglossata . 508 Our results suggest that both the extension of the disordered region following 509 the α - helix loop in the female - specific region of dsx and the feminizing function of 510 dsx for morphology occurred in the common ancestor of Aparaglossata . At present , 511 the causality between these two events is uncertain , as we do not know which of the 512 23 events appeared earlier . In general , disordered regions in transcription factors play 513 essential roles in transcriptional activity through post - translational modifications and 514 binding to co - activators and nucleic acids ( Liu et al . 2006 ; Darling and Uversly 2018 ) . 515 Furthermore , Wang et al . ( 2019 ) showed that in the diamondback moth Plutella 516 xylostella , when the Aparaglossata - specific motif is specifically broken by deletion or 517 frameshift mutations using the CRISPR / Cas9 method , the female morphology is 518 transformed into the intersexual phenotype . This result indicates that the 519 Aparaglossata - specific motif is essential for female differentiation of morphology in 520 P . xylostella . These facts suggest that the extension of the C - terminal region of dsx 521 female - type may have been a key event associated with the acquisition of the female - 522 differentiating roles of dsx in morphology during postembryonic development . This 523 functional evolution of the " non - functional " isoform by the coding mutation is also 524 consistent with an evolutionary process of alternative splicing isoforms theoretically 525 predicted lacking empirical evidence ( Keren et al . 2010 ) . 526 24 FIG . 5 . Evolution of C - terminal sequence of doublesex in insects . ( A ) Ancestral 527 sequences ( AS ) of dsx in insects . The AS were reconstructed from 49 dsx proteins of 528 insects by the maximum likelihood methods of the MEGA X . The information on the 529 species and proteins used for the AS reconstruction is listed in supplementary table 7 . 530 The most probable sequences were applied . The results of the AS reconstruction are 531 described in supplementary table 8 . The upper scheme indicates the dsx gene structure 532 of D . melanogaster . The lower image shows the result of the multiple sequence 533 alignments ( MSA ) of dsx sequences by MAFFT . The oligomerization domain 534 sequences at C - terminal side were used for the MSA . The white background in the 535 MSA result indicates the conserved sites that share the residues in the 80 % taxa . The 536 Aparaglossata - specific motif is indicated by the orange frame . ( B ) Predicted protein 537 structures of dsx female - type in common ancestors of insect taxa . The phylogenetic 538 25 relationship is based on the topology of Misof et al . ( 2014 ) . The 3D images in the 539 right panel indicate the predicted structures of the OD domain including the female - 540 specific region of dsx . The protein structures were predicted by the AlphaFold2 - based 541 algorism ( ColabFold : Mirdita et al . 2021 ) . The red region of the 3D image indicates 542 the female - specific region . The green region shows the Aparaglossata - specific motif . 543 The information on the evaluated values ( predicted local distance difference test : 544 plDDT ) of the prediction is shown in the Material and Methods section and 545 supplementary fig . 10 . 546 547 On the origin of outputs of the sexual differentiation mechanism 548 Recent findings in insects ( e . g . , Mine et al . 2017 ; Guo et al . 2018 ; Zhuo et al . 549 2018 ; Wexler et al . 2019 ; Takahashi et al . 2021 ) , including this study , have shown 550 that sexual differentiation mechanisms are diverse in their outputs as well as their 551 gene repertoires . The diversity in the output is attributed to the functional diversity of 552 a single gene , dsx , for sexual differentiation of morphogenesis during postembryonic 553 development . The evolutionary origin of the diversity in the output is one of the 554 enigmatic problems in sexual development . Information on the roles of dsx is limited 555 to some traits in some species and cannot be available in many non - aparaglossatan 556 species although functional analyses of dsx have been rapidly progressing using 557 emerging model species . Unquestionably , comprehensive information on functions of 558 dsx for sexually dimorphic morphology from wider taxa is essential for fully tracing 559 the evolution of dsx . We propose , albeit premature , as one of the possibilities to be 560 considered , the hypothesis by which dsx might have become essential for female 561 differentiation in sexual morphology by expanding its cryptic feminizing role , i . e . , 562 functions for some female genes ' expression , in association with mutations in female - 563 specific motifs ( fig . 6 ) . This scenario can explain how single genes acquire novel 564 outputs of sexual development although our hypothesis does not prevent any other 565 alternative hypothesis from being proposed . 566 26 The diversity of mechanisms that produce animal sex is a model case of 567 developmental systemic drift ( True and Haag 2001 ; Haag and True 2021 ) . The 568 functional diversity of a single gene and its evolutionary process has not been focused 569 on in the context of developmental system drift to date due to its poor examples . Our 570 evolutionary scenario may be one hypothesis explaining the origin of the system drift 571 in the function of single genes . In this study , we have mainly discussed the 572 functionality of dsx for sexual differentiation of morphology during postembryonic 573 development . Therefore , it is unclear whether our conclusions and evolutionary 574 scenarios apply to sexual behavior , including sex pheromone secretion and courtship , 575 as well as sexual determination and gonadal differentiation during embryogenesis . 576 Detailed studies of sex differences at various levels across insect taxa will test our 577 evolutionary scenario and will fully reconstruct the evolutionary history of dsx and 578 sexual differentiation mechanisms . 579 27 FIG . 6 . Schematic image of the evolutionary scenario of doublesex proposed in this study and the feature of dsx in insects . dsx in arthr 580 may have been initially involved in only male determination / differentiation based on findings in crustaceans and chelicerates ( Kato et 581 Pomerantz et al . 2015 ; Li et al . 2018 ; Panara et al . 2019 ) . In our hypothesis , the female isoform of dsx may have been not essential for 582 differentiation of morphological traits at least from the common ancestor of Dicondylia to the common ancestor of Aparaglossata but m 583 contributed to the expression of some genes in females ( “cryptic feminizing function” in the figure ) . This “seemingly non - functional” i 584 might have become essential for female differentiation of morphological traits at the common ancestor of Aparaglossata emerging at ~ 585 thropods et al . 2011 ; or female t might have l” isoform t ~ 327 28 million years ago ( Ma ) through extending its cryptic feminizing function ( “functional expansion” in the figure ) or , alternatively , through 586 acquiring entirely novel function ( “neofunctionalization” in the figure ) . The extension of the C - terminus amino acid sequences in the female - 587 specific region might be involved in the functional expansion / neofunctionalization of dsx . The common ancestor between Branchiopoda and 588 Hexapoda may have had the male - specific expressed dsx . It is estimated that the sex - specific splicing control and the gene duplication of dsx 589 occurred from the common ancestor between Branchiopoda and Hexapoda emerging at ~ 508 Ma to the common ancestor of Dicondylia at ~ 421 590 Ma . The phylogenetic relationship and the divergence time refer to Misof et al . ( 2014 ) . The dotted line in the phylogenetic relationship indicates 591 that the taxa that occurred from the common ancestor between Branchiopoda and Dicondylia to the common ancestor of Dicondylia are omitted . 592 Here , we also show information on the current knowledge of dsx features in insects and a branchiopod . In Aparaglossata , since there are many 593 studies , we show only three representative species . The information was based on : Hildreth ( 1965 ) , Bruce and Baker ( 1989 ) and Cloudh et al . 594 ( 2014 ) in Drosophila melanogaster ( Diptera ) , Ohbayashi et al . ( 2001 ) , Suzuki et al . ( 2003 ) , and Xu et al . ( 2017 ) in Bombyx mori ( Lepidoptera ) , 595 Shukla and Palli ( 2012 ) in Tribolium castaneum ( Coleoptera ) , Roth et al . ( 2019 ) and Velasque et al . ( 2018 ) in Apis mellifera ( Hymenoptera ) , 596 Wang et al . ( 2020 ) in Nasonia vitripenis ( Hymenoptera ) , Mine et al . ( 2017 , 2021 ) in Athalia rosae ( Hymenoptera ) , Wexler et al . ( 2019 ) in 597 Pediculus humanus ( Psocodea ) and Blattella germanica ( Dictyoptera ) , Zhuo et al . ( 2018 ) in Nilaparvata lugens ( Hemiptera ) , Just et al . ( 2021 ) in 598 Oncopeltus fasciatus ( Hemiptera ) , Guo et al . ( 2018 ) in Bemisia tabaci ( Hemiptera ) , Miyazaki et al . ( 2021 ) in the wood roach Cryptocercus 599 punctulatus and Reticulitermes speratus ( Dictyoptera ) , Takahashi et al . ( 2019 , 2021 ) in Ischnura senegalensis ( Odonata ) , this study in 600 Thermobia domestica ( Zygentoma ) , and Kato et al . ( 2011 ) in Daphnia magna ( Branchiopoda ) . In Condylognatha , information on dsx in the 601 blood - sucking bug Rhodnius prolixus is omitted . R . prolixus has sex - specific isoforms of dsx whose function has not been investigated ( Wexler 602 et al . 2014 ) . The “unanalyzed” means the functional analyses of dsx have not been performed in the relevant species . Information on the roles of 603 dsx of some species in female morphogenesis is limited to some body parts : e . g . , body coloration in I . senegalensis ( Takahashi et al . 2021 ) , wing 604 morphology in Na . vitripenis ( Wang et al . 2020 ) , and worker morphology in Ap . mellifera ( Roth et al . 2019 ) . The asterisk ( * ) in Ap . mellifera 605 indicates that the functional analysis of dsx in males was not conducted although the gonad differentiation of female workers was affected by dsx 606 knockouts ( Roth et al . 2019 ; see Main text ) . The double - asterisk ( * * ) in I . senegalensis shows that this species has polymorphic coloration in 607 females , i . e . , gynomorph ( normal female color ) and andromorph ( male - like color ) and that dsx is involved in the color formation of the males 608 and andromorphic females but not gynomorphic females ( see Takahashi et al . 2021 ) , suggesting that dsx is not essential for the female color 609 development . In our hypothesis , the essential roles of dsx for female development in O . fasciatus ( Just et al . 2021 ) may have occurred in parallel 610 with Aparaglossata . 611 612 29 Materials and Methods 613 Animals 614 The firebrat , Thermobia domestica ( Packard 1873 ) , was used as an emerging 615 model for apterygote . T . domestica is one of the species belonging to Zygentoma 616 ( Lepismatidae ) . The insects were kept at 37°C in total darkness condition and fed with 617 fish food ( TetraFin Goldfish Flakes , Tetra GmbH , Melle , Germany ) in our laboratory . 618 Stock colonies were reared in plastic cases of 30 cm×40 cm or 18 cm × 25 cm in 619 length . Eggs were collected from tissue paper in the case and incubated at 37°C . For 620 examining the roles of dsx and dsx - like in the postembryonic morphogenesis , colonies 621 of hatched nymphs were reared up to the fourth instar in a six - well plate and then 622 transferred into 24 - well plates to be kept individually . For examining the roles of dsx 623 and dsx - like in vitellogenin expression , female and male insects were collected from 624 the stock colony and transferred into the plates . For examining the function of dsx and 625 dsx - like for sexual morphology and gametogenesis , we used firebrats from April to 626 June , 2019 , February to April , April to July , and September to December , 2020 . For 627 investigating the roles of dsx and dsx - like in the vitellogenin expression , firebrats were 628 manipulated from June to July , 2020 . 629 Estimation of molt timing 630 Estimating the molt timing of insects is essential for the analysis of 631 developmental processes and the functions of developmental regulatory genes . The 632 timing of Hemi - or holometabolan insects can be estimated using morphological 633 changes such as a wing growth . However , timing is hard to estimate in apterygote 634 insects since they have little change in their morphology during postembryonic 635 development . T . domestica forms scales in the fourth instar , and changes the number 636 30 and length of its styli during the fourth to ninth instar under our breeding conditions . 637 These features can be used to estimate molt timing , but it is difficult to apply these 638 criteria to experiments using adults or a large number of nymphs . To resolve this 639 problem , we used leg regeneration after autotomy and time - lapse imaging to estimate 640 the molt timing of T . domestica . Autotomy occurs at the joint between the trochanter 641 and femur in T . domestica . An autotomized leg regenerates after one molt ( Buck and 642 Edwards , 1990 ) . For the RNAi analysis during postembryonic development , we 643 amputated a right hindleg at the autotomic rift , using tweezers , and observed whether 644 the leg had regenerated . This test enabled us to rapidly estimate the molt timing . For 645 the RNA - seq and the RT - qPCR analysis , the time - lapse imaging was used to 646 determine the precise time of molt . We build a time - lapse imaging system with a 647 network camera system ( SANYO , Tokyo , Japan ) set in an incubator at 37°C 648 ( supplementary fig . 7A ) . Photos of insects in the 24 - well plate were taken every five 649 minutes . We created a time - lapse movie from the photos every 12 hours using ImageJ 650 1 . 52a ( https : / / imagej . nih . gov / ij / ) and observed whether the insects molted 651 ( supplementary fig . 7B ) . 652 De novo genome assembly 653 A whole genome of T . domestica was sequenced to analyze the exon - intron 654 structure of dsx . We selected an adult female of T . domestica from our stock colony 655 and removed its alimentary canal . Genomic DNA was extracted from the sample 656 using DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit ( QIAGEN K . K . , Tokyo , Japan ) . A paired - end 657 library was constructed from 1 µg of the DNA using TruSeq DNA PCR - Free LT 658 Sample Prep kits ( Illumina K . K . , Tokyo , Japan ) following the manufacturer’s 659 instructions . The library was run on a sequencer ( HiSeq 2500 ; Illumina K . K . , Tokyo , 660 Japan ) . We obtained 417 Gb of raw reads and assembled them using Platanus v1 . 2 . 4 661 31 assembler ( Kajitani et al . 2014 ) after removal of the adapter sequences . The genome 662 sequence can be obtained from the DNA Data Bank in Japan ( Accession number : 663 DRA005797 ; Bioproject : PRJDB5781 ) . 664 Transcriptome analysis 665 To search for doublesex ( dsx ) and vitellogenin ( vtg ) homologs , we performed 666 RNA - seq analysis . Adults of 15 ♀♀ and 15 ♂♂ of T . domestica were sampled 1440 667 minutes after a molt in December , 2019 . The fat bodies of the individuals were 668 removed using tweezers in a phosphated buffered saline ( PBS ; pH = 7 . 2 ) . Three adults 669 were used per sample . Total RNA was extracted from 10 samples ( 5 ♀♀ , 5 ♂♂ ) using 670 RNeasy Micro kits ( QIAGEN K . K . , Tokyo , Japan ) following the manufacturer’s 671 instructions . The concentration of purified RNA was measured using a Qubit 4 672 fluorometer ( QIAGEN K . K . , Tokyo , Japan ) with Qubit RNA BR Assay kits 673 ( QIAGEN K . K . , Tokyo , Japan ) . Paired - end libraries were constructed from 100 ng of 674 the total RNAs using TruSeq RNA Library Prep kits v2 ( Illumina K . K . , Tokyo , 675 Japan ) following the manufacturer’s instructions . The libraries were run on a 676 sequence ( Hiseq , Illumina , Tokyo , Japan ) . The library preparation and sequencing 677 were performed by Genewiz Strand - Specific RNA - seq service . We mapped the reads 678 obtained to the assembled genome using the HISAT2 program ( Kim et al . 2019 ) with 679 a default option and counted the mapped reads using the STRINGTie program 680 ( Pertea , 2015 ) with default parameter settings . Differential expression gene analysis 681 was performed based on the count matrix using the “edgeR” package ( Robinson et al . 682 2010 ) in R - v4 . 0 . 3 ( R Core Team , 2020 ) . Information about the samples can be 683 obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information ( NCBI ) BioSample 684 database ( Accession number : SAMN18175012 – SAMN18175021 ) . 685 Molecular phylogenetic analysis 686 32 Dsx is a member of the Doublesex and Mab - 3 Related transcriptional factors 687 ( DMRT ) family , and has a DNA binding domain , Doublesex and Mab - 3 ( DM ) 688 domain . Pancrustacea generally has four DMRT family genes , Dsx , Dmrt11 , 689 Dmrt93B , and Dmrt99B ( Mawaribuchi et al . 2019 ) . Phylogenetic analysis of Dsx 690 homologs was performed using the amino acid sequences of the DM domain . We 691 used the Dsx sequences of D . melanogaster as a query and obtained 97 metazoan 692 DMRT family proteins from the NCBI and the i5k databases 693 ( https : / / i5k . nal . usda . gov / ) and our genome data of T . domestica by the BLAST 694 analysis ( listed in supplementary table 1 ) . We then aligned the sequences using 695 MAFFT version 7 ( Katoh et al . 2013 ) with the - linsi option ( to use an accuracy 696 option , L - INS - i ) and manually extracted the DM domain , which consisted of 61 697 amino acids ( supplementary fig . 8 ) . The result of the multiple sequence alignment can 698 be obtained from supplementary sequence file 1 . Molecular phylogenetic analysis of 699 the aligned sequences was performed using a maximum likelihood method after 700 selecting a substitution model ( JTT matrix - based model ) with MEGA X ( Kumar et al . 701 2018 ) . Bootstrap values were calculated after 1000 replications . 702 Full - length cDNA and exon - intron structures 703 To elucidate the exon - intron structures of Dsx and Dsx - like , we determined 704 the full - length cDNA sequences using a Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends ( RACE ) 705 method and performed a BLAST analysis for our genome database of T . domestica . 706 We extracted total RNA from eggs , whole bodies , fat body , and gonads of nymphs 707 and adult females and males of T . domestica using TRI Reagent ( Molecular Research 708 Center Inc . , Ohio , USA ) following the manufacturer’s instructions . The total RNAs 709 were treated with RNase - Free DNase I ( New England BioLabs Japan Inc . , Tokyo , 710 Japan ) to exclude remaining genomic DNA and purified by phenol / chloroform 711 33 extraction and ethanol precipitation . For 5 (cid:3) - RACE analysis , mRNAs were purified 712 from 75 µg of the total RNAs using Dynabeads mRNA Purification kit ( Thermo 713 Fisher Scientific K . K . , Tokyo , Japan ) following the manufacturer’s instruction . We 714 then ligated an RNA oligo at the 5’ - end of the mRNA using GeneRacer Advanced 715 RACE kits ( Thermo Fisher Scientific K . K . , Tokyo , Japan ) . For 3 (cid:3) - RACE analysis , 716 we ligated an RNA oligo of the SMART RACE cDNA Amplification Kit ( Takara Bio 717 Inc . , Shiga , Japan ) at 3 (cid:3) - end of the total RNA during reverse transcription . First 718 stranded ( fs - ) cDNA was generated from the RNAs using SuperScript III Reverse 719 Transcriptase ( Thermo Fisher Scientific K . K . , Tokyo , Japan ) . We used primers 720 specific to the RNA oligos and performed RACE analysis by nested RT - PCR using 721 Q5 High - Fidelity DNA polymerase ( New England BioLabs Japan Inc . , Tokyo , 722 Japan ) . The primers specific to dsx and dsx - like were made from sequences of the 723 relevant genomic regions and are listed in supplementary table 9 . The amplicons were 724 separated using the agarose gel - electrophoresis and cloned using TOPO TA Cloning 725 Kit for Sequencing ( Thermo Fisher Scientific K . K . , Tokyo , Japan ) following the 726 manufacture’s protocol . We used a DH5 α Escherichia coli strain ( TOYOBO CO . , 727 LTD . , Osaka , Japan ) as the host cell . Plasmids were extracted using the alkaline lysis 728 and purified by phenol - chloroform and ethanol precipitation . The nucleotide 729 sequences of the cloned amplicons were determined from the purified plasmids by the 730 Sanger Sequencing service of FASMAC Co . Ltd . ( Kanagawa , Japan ) . We then 731 searched the genomic region of the full - length cDNA sequences of dsx and dsx - like 732 via local blastn analysis . 733 Reverse transcription - quantitative PCR ( RT - qPCR ) 734 To quantitative mRNA expression levels , we performed RT - qPCR analysis . 735 For investigating the sex - specific expression profile of dsx and dsx - like , we used the 736 34 fat body of adults of T . domestica since the sexes can be distinguishable by the 737 external morphology at this stage . Fat bodies also exhibit sex - specific physiological 738 functions in adults . Thirteenth instar individuals and adults after molting were 739 sampled for investigating roles of the genes in the sexually dimorphic morphology 740 and the vitellogenin expression , respectively . The sample sizes are reported in the 741 figure legends and supplementary table 2 . We dissected the individuals in PBS and 742 collected their fat body in 2 ml tubes containing TRI Reagent ( Molecular Research 743 Center Inc . , Ohio , USA ) . The fat bodies then were disrupted using a TissueLyser LT 744 small beads mill ( QIAGEN K . K . , Tokyo , Japan ) . These disrupted samples were 745 preserved at −80°C until used . Total RNA was extracted from the samples according 746 to the manufacture’s protocol for the TRI Reagent . Extracted RNA was treated with 747 2 % RNase - free DNase I ( New England BioLabs Japan Inc . , Tokyo , Japan ) at 37°C for 748 40 minutes and purified by phenol / chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation . 749 We measured the concentration of the total RNA using a spectrophotometer ( DS - 11 + , 750 Denovix Inc . , Wilmington , USA ) . fs - cDNA was synthesized from 350 ng of the total 751 RNA using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase ( Thermo Fisher Scientific K . K . , 752 Tokyo , Japan ) . We diluted the fs - cDNA to 1 : 2 with MilliQ water and preserved it at 753 −30°C until it was used in RT - qPCR assay . The RT - qPCR assays were performed 754 using a LightCycler 96 instrument ( Roche , Basel , Switzerland ) according to the 755 manufacture’s protocol with the THUNDERBIRD SYBR qPCR Mix ( TOYOBO Co . 756 Ltd . , Osaka , Japan ) . The reaction volume was 10 µl . We used 1 µl of the fs - cDNA as 757 templates . The preparation of the RT - qPCR solution proceeded on ice . The protocol 758 of the RT - qPCR was as follows : preincubation at 95°C for 600 seconds and 45 cycles 759 of three - step reactions , such as denaturation at 95°C for 15 seconds , annealing at 60°C 760 for 15 seconds and extension at 72°C for 45 seconds . We used ribosomal protein 49 761 35 ( rp49 ) as a reference gene , as described by Ohde et al . ( 2011 ) . We designed primer 762 sets of the target genes by the Primer3Web version 4 . 1 . 0 ( Untergasser et al . 2012 ) 763 following the manufacture’s recommended condition of the THUNDERBIRD SYBR 764 qPCR Mix . We confirmed the primers’ specificity using melting curves ranging from 765 65°C to 95°C . We selected primer sets exhibiting a single peak . The primers are listed 766 in supplementary table 9 . Each RT - qPCR was technically replicated three times . 767 Some samples were excluded before analyzing the data when the Ct value of any 768 genes was not detected in one or more replicates or when the Ct value of the reference 769 gene deviated from that of other samples . In these removed data , a technical error was 770 suspected . We calculated the expression level of target genes by the 2 - ΔΔ Ct method 771 ( Livak and Schmittgen 2001 ) and performed the Brunner – Munzel ( BM ) test for Δ Ct 772 value . The BM test was carried out using R - v4 . 0 . 3 . with the brunnermuzel . test 773 function of the “brunnermuzel” package ( https : / / cran . r - 774 project . org / web / packages / brunnermunzel / index . html ) . Holm’s method was used for 775 multiple comparison analyses between the control and treatments . The data are listed 776 in supplementary table 2 . In the dsx expression of the RNAi male , we performed the 777 Smirnov - Grubbs ( SG ) test for Δ Ct value using the grubbs . test function of the 778 “outliers” package in R ( https : / / cran . r - project . org / web / packages / outliers / index . html ) 779 ( supplementary table 3 ) . An outlier was detected in the dsx RNAi male . We 780 repeatedly performed the SG test using the data excluding the outlier . No further 781 outliers were detected . Lastly , we re - analyzed the data , excluding the outlier , using 782 the BM test ( supplementary table 2 ) . 783 RNAi analysis 784 The RNAi assay can be used to examine the roles of genes during 785 postembryonic development in T . domestica ( Ohde et al . 2011 ) . The sexual 786 36 differentiation of insects is generally assumed to be a cell - autonomous mechanism 787 that is independent of systemic hormonal - control ( Verhulst and van de Zande 2015 ) 788 as discussed in De Loof and Huybrechts ( 1998 ) and Bear and Monteiro ( 2013 ) and 789 progresses during postembryonic development . Therefore , nymphal RNAi is the most 790 effective tool to investigate the roles of genes on sexual trait formation during 791 postembryonic development . To reduce the risk of off - target effects , the dsRNA was 792 designed to avoid the region of the DM domain . We also confirmed that the dsRNA 793 had no contiguous matches of more than 20 bases with other genes on the genome by 794 BLAST ( blastn option ) . To produce templates for the dsRNA , we cloned the regions 795 of dsx and dsx - like from the fs - cDNA using the same method as the RACE analysis . 796 We amplified the template DNAs from purified plasmids with PCR using Q5 High - 797 Fidelity DNA Polymerase and purified the amplified DNA with the 798 phenol / chloroform extraction and the ethanol precipitation . dsRNA was synthesized 799 from the purified DNA using Ampliscribe T7 - Flash Transcription kits ( Epicentre 800 Technologies , Co . , Wisconsin , USA ) . We designed the PCR primers using the 801 Primer3Web version 4 . 1 . 0 ( Untergasser et al . 2012 ) . The PCR primers are listed in 802 supplementary table 9 . In nymphal RNAi analysis , we injected the dsRNAs repeatedly 803 into the abdomen of the nymphs of T . domestica with each molt from the fourth or 804 fifth instar to thirteenth instar to sustain the RNAi effect during postembryonic 805 development . The initial stage was the same within a single experiment . This repeated 806 RNAi treatment was effective in some insects such as Blattella germanica ( Wexler et 807 al . 2019 ) . We sampled the individuals one , three , and five days after molting , using 808 phenotypic observations , analysis of dsx knockdown effects , and the oocyte number . 809 To determine the sex of individuals , we initially observed the gonads : testis and 810 ovary . In our RNAi analysis , the gonads completely formed and there was no 811 37 difference between the control and dsx RNAi individuals in external morphology ( fig . 812 2C ) . Therefore , individuals with testis were males and those with ovaries were 813 females . T . domestica molts throughout its life , even after sexual maturation , and 814 produces vtg during each adult instar ( Rousset and Bitsch 1993 ) . To analyze the vtg 815 mRNA levels , we also injected the dsRNAs of dsx and dsx - like repeatedly into the 816 females and males every three days from 12 hours after molting . We sampled the 817 females and males at 720±20 minutes after subsequently molts . 818 Phenotype observation 819 We dissected thirteenth instar individuals in PBS using tweezers and removed 820 the thoraxes , reproductive systems , and external genital organs . We took images using 821 the digital microscope system ( VHX - 5000 , KEYENCE , Tokyo , Japan ) . The thoraxes 822 and external genital organs were fixed with FAA fixative ( formaldehyde : ethanol : 823 acetic acid = 15 : 5 : 1 ) at 25°C overnight and then preserved in 90 % ethanol . We used 824 the length of the prothorax as an indicator of body size . To measure the prothoracic 825 width , the prothoracic notum was removed from the fixed thorax after treatment with 826 10 % NaOH solution at 60°C for 30 minutes to dissolve the soft tissues . The notum 827 was mounted in Lemosol on a microscope slide . The prepared specimens were imaged 828 using a KEYENCE VHX - 5000 . With the microscope at 50× , the length of the notum 829 was measured . The ovipositor length was also measured using the microscope at 20× 830 and 50× . To count the sperm number , sperm was collected from seminal vesicles and 831 diluted with 5 ml MilliQ water . 50 µl of the diluted sperm was spotted on a 832 microscope slide and dried overnight . We technically replicated the measurement 833 three times for ovipositor length and six times in sperm number and calculated these 834 means . Measurement was performed by blinding the treatment . We counted the 835 number of oocytes in ovarioles using an optical microscope at 50× ( Olympus , Tokyo , 836 38 Japan ) . A generalized linear model ( GLM ) was used to analyze differences in 837 ovipositor length ( length data ) and sperm and oocyte number ( count data ) among 838 RNAi treatments . The body size , target genes , and interactions between the target 839 genes were used as explanatory variables . The length was assumed to follow a 840 Gaussian distribution , and the count data to have a negative binomial distribution . We 841 used R - v4 . 0 . 3 in these analyses and the glm and the glm . nb ( MASS package ) 842 functions for the length and count data , respectively . To analyze the contribution of 843 the explanatory variables , a likelihood ratio test for the result of GLM was performed 844 using the Anova function of the car package . The statistical results are listed in 845 supplementary table 4 ( female ) and 5 ( male ) . 846 Scanning Electron Microscopy ( SEM ) 847 The NanoSuit method ( Takaku et al . 2013 ) was used for the SEM analysis . 848 Male penises and female ovipositors preserved in 90 % ethanol were washed with 849 distilled water and immersed in 1 % Tween20 at 25°C for 10 minutes . The samples 850 were mounted on stubs and imaged using a low - vacuum SEM ( DX - 500 ; KEYENCE , 851 Tokyo , Japan ) . 852 Histology 853 The gonads of RNAi individuals were fixed with Bouin’s fixative ( saturated 854 picric acid : formaldehyde : glacial acetic acid = 15 : 5 : 1 ) at 25°C overnight and washed 855 with 90 % ethanol plus Lithium Carbonate ( Li 2 CO 3 ) . The ovipositors of RNAi 856 individuals were fixed with FAA fixative at 25°C overnight and then were transferred 857 into 90 % ethanol . The samples were dehydrated and cleared with an ethanol - butanol 858 series . The cleared samples were immersed and embedded in paraffin at 60°C . The 859 paraffin blocks were polymerized at 4°C and cut into 5 µm thick sections using a 860 microtome ( RM2155 : Leica , Wetzlar , Germany ) . The sections were mounted on 861 39 microscope slides coated with egg white - glycerin and stained using Delafield’s 862 Hematoxylin and Eosin staining . After staining with the hematoxylin , the slides were 863 washed with 1 % hydrochloric acid - ethanol for 40 seconds . The stained slides were 864 enclosed with Canada balsam . We observed the slides on an optical microscope 865 ( Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) and took photos using a digital single - lens reflex camera 866 ( Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) . 867 Ancestral Sequence Reconstruction 868 To infer the sequence evolution of the dsx , we conducted an ancestral 869 sequence reconstruction ( ASR ) of the C - terminal sequences of the dsx female - type 870 homologous sequence . First , we searched homologous sequences to dsx female - type 871 from NCBI protein / transcript shotgun assembly databases and previous studies . The 872 searches in the NCBI databases were performed by BLAST search . We closely 873 examined the alignment results of the BLAST and selected sequences with at least 10 874 amino acids aligned with the female - specific region of each query sequence . We do 875 not know whether some of these sequences are expressed in females and contribute to 876 female morphogenesis , as these sequences are not necessarily to have investigated 877 expression and function in the species . We decided that it was not problem to use 878 these sequences since we focused on the evolution of sequences homologous to dsx 879 female - type in each insect taxa . In Diptera , we set dsx female - type of D . melanogaster 880 ( Accession # : NP _ 001287220 ) as a query and obtained 9 sequences . In Lepidoptera , 881 we used dsx female - type of B . mori ( NP _ 001036871 ) as a query and get 10 sequences . 882 In Coleoptera , dsx female - type of Tribolium castaneum ( AFQ62106 ) was set in a 883 query and then 10 sequences were obtained . We used dsx female - type of Ap . mellifera 884 ( NP _ 001128407 ) and At . rosae ( XP _ 012262256 ) as queries to search hymenopteran 885 sequences . We also searched some hymenopteran sequences from the NCBI databases 886 40 based on a previous study ( Baral et al . 2019 ) . 10 hymenopteran sequences were 887 obtained . In Psocodea and Hymenoptera , we searched the databases to set the 888 sequences of Pediculus humanus ( QGB21102 ) and Rhodonius prolixus ( QGB21099 ) 889 as queries . Wexler et al . ( 2019 ) showed that dsx of Pediculus humanus ( Psocodea ) has 890 isoforms without sex - specificity . In this study , based on the blast search and exon 891 structure , we regarded that the PhDsx1 in Wexler et al . ( 2019 ) is homologous to the 892 dsx female - type . The sequences of Ni . lugens ( AWJ25056 ) and Bl . germanica 893 ( QGB21105 and QGB21106 ) were obtained from the database based on previous 894 studies ( Zhuo et al . 2018 ; Wexler et al . 2019 ) . We selected two sequences from Bl . 895 germanica , as this species has two female - specific dsx isoforms ( Wexler et al . 2019 ) . 896 The sequences of Cryptocercus punctulatus and I . senegalensis were obtained from 897 previous studies ( Miyazaki et al . 2021 ; Takahashi et al . 2021 ) . In T . domestica , the 898 sequence identified in this study was used . The sequence names are listed in 899 supplementary table 7 . We then manually extracted the OD domain and performed 900 multiple sequence alignments ( MSA ) using the MAFFT version 7 ( Katoh et al . 2013 ) 901 with the - linsi option ( to use an accuracy option , L - INS - i ) ( supplementary sequence 902 file 2 ) . We reconstructed ancestral sequences ( AS ) from the MSA using MEGA X 903 software . The maximum - likelihood method was applied to the ASR . The JTT + G 904 model was chosen as a substitution model by AIC - based model selection . The guide 905 tree was reconstructed based on previously reported phylogenetic relationships 906 ( Wiegmann et al . 2011 ; Misof et al . 2014 ; Li et al . 2017 ; Peters et al . 2017 ; Zhang et 907 al . 2018 ; Kawahara et al . 2019 ; McKenna et al . 2019 ; Gustafson et al . 2020 ) 908 ( supplementary fig . 9 ) . We selected the most probable sequences for the following 909 analyses . The results of ASR can be seen in supplementary table 8 . The probabilities 910 of sites of AS that we focused on are listed in supplementary table 10 . In 911 41 Aparaglossata ( Node 77 ) and Holometabola ( Node 87 ) AS , almost all probabilities of 912 sites were more than 0 . 9 . The except sites were sites 83 and 98 in Node 77 and sites 913 77 – 79 and 83 in Node 87 . These sites other than sites 77 had probabilities > 0 . 5 . Thus , 914 we concluded that the AS in Aparaglossata and Holometabola , which we considered 915 the most critical , was reconstructed with sufficient reliability . Any residues had the 916 probabilities = 0 in the Aparaglossata - specific region of Holometabola AS . In 917 contrast , in non - holometabolan insects , since our taxon sampling is limited to several 918 species ( Eumetabola in Node 92 , Neoptera in Node95 , Pterygota in Node 96 ) , the 919 probabilities of some sites are lower than 0 . 5 . These low probable sites are not 920 necessarily confident . To conclude with reliability , it is no doubt that analyses based 921 on a larger number of species will be essential . However , all sites of the 922 Aparaglossata - specific region in these AS were gaps with the probabilities > 0 . 9 . The 923 result of the sites of the Aparaglossata - specific region seems to be relatively reliable 924 in our analysis . Thus , our conclusion that the Aparaglossata - specific region occurred 925 in the common ancestor of Aparaglossata would be confident . To compare the 926 sequences , we then performed MSA of the most probable reconstructed ancestral 927 sequences and the sequence of D . melanogaster using MAFFT version 7 ( fig . 5A ) . 928 Protein Structure Prediction 929 To infer the evolution of protein structures of dsx , we conducted the protein 930 structure prediction . The ancestral sequences reconstructed by the above section were 931 used for the protein structure prediction . The sequences were obtained from 932 supplementary sequence file 3 . The protein structure prediction was performed using 933 the Alphafold2 - based algorism ( ColabFold : Mirdita et al . 2021 ) with the default 934 option . The accuracy of predictions was evaluated based on the predicted Local 935 distance difference test ( plDDT ) score that was automatically calculated on the 936 42 ColabFold . We selected a model with the highest average plDDT score in each 937 prediction . The average plDDT scores were 81 . 824 ( Aparaglossata ) , 89 . 165 938 ( Holometabola ) , 87 . 376 ( Eumetabola ) , 90 . 721 ( Neoptera ) , and 90 . 720 ( Pterygota ) . 939 The plDDT scores were more than 70 in the helical structure predicted as the α - helix 940 loop of the female - specific dsx region . Generally , predicted structures of plDDT > 70 941 are regarded to be a confident prediction ( cf . , Tunyasuvunakool et al . 2021 ) . 942 Therefore , we assessed the α - helix loop of the female - specific region of dsx as the 943 confidently predicted structure . The graph of the plDDT score of each model is shown 944 in supplementary fig . 10 . The 3D models of predicted structures were visualized with 945 the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System , Version 2 . 0 ( Schrödinger , LLC . ) . On the 946 viewer , we colored the female - specific region and the Aparaglossata - specific region 947 with red color and the green color , respectively . 948 Data availability 949 The draft genome data was deposited in the DNA Data Bank of Japan ( Accession 950 number : DRA005797 ; Bioproject : PRJDB5781 ) . The raw read data of the 951 transcriptome was in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive ( Accession numbers : 952 SRR13870115 – SRR13870124 ; Bioproject : PRJNA707122 ) . The sequences of dsx 953 male - type , dsx female - type , and dsx - like are also in GenBank ( Accession numbers : 954 MW711323 , MW711324 , and MW711325 , respectively ) . 955 956 Acknowledgments 957 We express gratitude to Dr .
