ATP binds single headed myosin VI following a two - step reaction mechanism with formation of a low affinity collision complex ( 1 / K 1 ’ = 5 . 6 mM ) followed by isomerization ( k + 2 ’ = 176 s - 1 ) to a state with weak actin affinity . The rates and affinity for ADP binding were measured by kinetic competition with ATP . This approach allows a broader range of ADP concentrations to be examined than with fluorescent nucleotide analogs , permitting the identification and characterization of transiently populated intermediates in the pathway . ADP binding to actomyosin VI , as with ATP binding , occurs via a two - step mechanism . The association rate constant for ADP binding is ~ 5 times greater than for ATP binding because of a higher affinity in the collision complex ( 1 / K 5b ’ = 2 . 2 mM ) and faster isomerization rate constant ( k + 5a ’ = 366 s - 1 ) . By equilibrium titration , both heads of a myosin VI dimer bind actin strongly in rigor and with bound ADP . In the presence of ATP , conditions that favor processive stepping , myosin VI does not dwell with both heads strongly - bound to actin , indicating that the second head inhibits strong binding of the lead head to actin . With both heads strongly bound , ATP binding is accelerated 2 . 5 - fold and ADP binding is accelerated > 10 - fold without affecting the rate of ADP release . We conclude the heads of myosin VI communicate allosterically and accelerate nucleotide binding , but not dissociation , when both are strongly bound to actin . 2 by gu e s t on S e p t e m b e r 1 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m Introduction The myosin family of molecular motors constitutes a large gene family of proteins that couple the energy from ATP binding , hydrolysis and product release to force generation along actin filaments ( 1 ) . At least 18 classes ( Class I - XVIII ) make up the family ( 2 ) . All possess a highly conserved catalytic motor domain ( referred to as “head” ) that binds actin , hydrolyzes ATP and performs the mechanical work . In non - muscle cells , cytoplasmic myosins are required for various cellular processes including membrane and RNA trafficking , cell migration and cytokinesis ( 3 ) . The nucleotide bound to myosin dictates the affinity for actin filaments ( 1 ) . In the absence of nucleotide or with bound ADP , myosin binds actin filaments with high ( < 1 µ M ) affinity ; these states are referred to as “strongly - bound states” . With ATP or the hydrolysis products , ADP - P i , bound , myosin binds actin with low affinity and rapidly attaches and detaches from the actin filament on a sub - microsecond timescale ; these nucleotide states are called “weakly - bound states” . The strong binding states are force - bearing intermediates but the weak binding states are not . The fraction of the total ATPase cycle time spent strongly bound to actin is called the duty ratio . Because under physiological nucleotide concentrations ATP binding is largely favored over ADP binding , ADP release limits the lifetime of the strongly bound actomyosin states and dictates the duty ratio . There is a long history documenting complex reactions for ADP binding to actomyosin ( see Ref . 1 for review and references ) . While skeletal muscle actomyosin - II binds ADP weakly ( K d > 100 µ M ) in a rapid equilibrium ( 4 ) , smooth muscle myosin ( 5 ) and some non - muscle actomyosin isoforms ( 6 - 10 ) , bind ADP with high ( K d < 10 µ M ) 3 by gu e s t on S e p t e m b e r 1 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m affinities . Several actomyosins with high ADP binding affinities display an ADP - induced rotation of the light chain - binding domain ( 11 , 12 ) and are likely to populate multiple actomyosin - ADP states ( 5 - 7 ) . Myosin VI spends most ( > 70 % ) of its ATPase cycle time bound strongly to actin ( i . e . it is a “high duty ratio motor” ) in the presence of physiological actin and ATP concentrations , primarily as a result of a slow , rate - limiting ADP release ( 7 ) , but weak and slow ATP binding also contribute to the high duty ratio ( 7 ) . The rate of ATP binding to myosin VI is much slower than other characterized myosins ( 7 ) , with the exception of some rat myosin I isoforms ( myr - 1 and myr - 2 / myo1c ) which also bind ATP slowly ( 13 , 14 ) . ATP binding to these myosins is thought to involve significant conformational rearrangement ( 7 , 13 , 14 ) . Although recent evidence indicates that myosin VI is monomeric ( 15 ) , dimeric myosin VI ( double - headed , referred to as HMM ) is enzymatically ( 7 ) and mechanically ( 16 , 17 ) processive , which means that it undergoes multiple ATP turnovers and takes multiple steps per diffusional encounter with an actin filament . Myosin VI - HMM takes an average of 6 steps per diffusional encounter , a value predicted from solution kinetics ( 7 ) , and subsequently confirmed by single - molecule measurements ( 16 , 17 ) . Despite the predicted short lever arm of myosin VI , the step size is ~ 35 - 38 nm , ( 16 , 17 ) roughly equal to a half pitch of the actin pseudo helical repeat of an actin filament . The step size is weakly dependent on load ( 18 ) , but is reduced from ~ 35 nm to ~ 27 nm as loads approach the stalling force ( ~ 2 pN ) . An important feature of myosin VI processivity is slow , rate - limiting ADP release that allows myosin VI - HMM to dwell with at least one head strongly - bound to the actin 4 by gu e s t on S e p t e m b e r 1 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m filament during processive stepping ( 7 ) . Most models of myosin V and VI processivity favor strong actin binding through both heads simultaneously , or predominantly the trailing head ( 19 , 20 ) , and implicate cooperativity between the two heads in regulating ( slowing or accelerating ) progression through the ATPase cycle ( 7 , 16 , 19 - 21 ) . The catalytic cycles of the myosin VI - HMM heads are not independent ( 7 ) , but the mechanism of coordination is unknown . It has been hypothesized that the heads communicate allosterically during processive stepping through ATP binding ( 7 ) and P i release ( 7 , 20 ) . Though it has been demonstrated that an applied backwards load weakens ATP binding and favors ADP binding to myosin VI - HMM ( 18 ) , experimental evidence supporting intramolecular head - head communication through effects on the ATPase cycle kinetics is lacking . In this study we have investigated the mechanism of ATP and ADP binding to single and double - headed actomyosin VI to a ) define the molecular basis of slow and weak ATP binding , b ) determine the mechanism of head - head communication and c ) test the hypothesis ( 7 ) that ATP binding to the trailing head of the myosin VI dimer is accelerated by the leading head . Our results allow us to formulate a model of processive myosin VI stepping , accounting for the effects of intramolecular load on the ATPase cycle kinetics . Experimental Procedures Reagents : All chemicals and reagents were the highest purity commercially available . ATP ( 99 + % purity as assayed by HPLC , data not shown ) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals ( Indianapolis , IN ) and ADP ( Sigma A - 5285 , 99 + % purity 5 by gu e s t on S e p t e m b e r 1 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m as assayed by HPLC , data not shown ) was purchased from Sigma ( St . Louis , MO ) . Nucleotides were purified by HPLC before use if necessary . Nucleotide concentrations were determined by absorbance at 259 nm using ∈ 259 of 15 , 400 M - 1 cm - 1 . A molar equivalent of MgCl 2 was added to nucleotides immediately before use . Pyrenyl - iodoacetamide came from Molecular Probes ( Eugene , OR ) . Imidazole ( fluorescence grade , 99 + % , titration ) and phalloidin were purchased from Sigma . Protein expression and purification : Single - headed ( referred to as S1 ) and double - headed ( referred to as HMM ) myosin VI with bound calmodulin ( CaM ) , the physiological light chain , were purified from Sf 9 cells by Flag affinity chromatography ( 7 ) . The single - headed construct ( T406A mutant ) was truncated at Gly840 ( 7 ) . The double - headed construct ( myosin VI - HMM , T406E mutant ) was truncated at Arg992 to include 20 native heptad repeats of predicted coiled coil , followed by a GCN4 leucine zipper to ensure dimerization , and a Flag tag ( 7 ) . Mutagenesis of threonine 406 regulates actin - activated P i release specifically and does not affect ATP or ADP binding to actomyosin VI ( 7 ) . Purity was > 98 % for all preparations , with actin being the only detectible contaminant . By UV absorbance , purified protein preparations contained undetectable levels of bound nucleotide . Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle , labeled with pyrene , gel filtered over Sephacryl S - 300HR , and polymerized by dialysis against KMg50 buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 1 mM DTT , and 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 ) . Phalloidin ( 1 . 1 molar equivalents ) was used to stabilize actin filaments . Stopped - flow measurements and kinetic modeling : All experiments were performed in KMg50 buffer with an Applied Photophysics ( Surrey , UK ) SX . 18MV - R 6 by gu e s t on S e p t e m b e r 1 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m stopped flow apparatus thermostatted at 25 ( ± 0 . 1 ) ° C . Concentrations stated are final after mixing . Pyrene fluorescence ( λ ex = 366 nm ) was monitored at 90 ° through a 400 nm long pass colored glass filter . Long time courses were corrected for minor contributions from photobleaching by subtracting the time courses of fluorescence acquired after mixing pyrene actin filaments with nucleotides . Essentially identical results were obtained when time courses of strongly bound pyrene actomyosin mixed with buffer alone were used for correction . Light scattering was measured at 90 ° with excitation at 320 nm . Most of the time courses shown in the figures are of individual , unaveraged , 1000 - point transients collected with the instrument in oversampling mode . Typically , multiple ( 3 - 8 ) time courses were averaged before analysis . Time courses that display fast and slow phases ( Figures 2 , 8 , and 9 ) were collected on a logarithmic time scale . The intrinsic time constant for data acquisition is ~ 30 µ sec . Nonlinear least - squares fitting was done using Pro - K software provided with the instrument or with Kaleidagraph ( Synergy Software , Reading , PA ) . Time courses of pyrene fluorescence changes were fitted to a sum of exponentials ( Eq . 1 ) : ∑ − + = = − n i t k i i e A F t F 1 o ) 1 ( ) ( ( Eq . 1 ) , where F ( t ) is the fluorescence at time t , F o is the initial fluorescence intensity , A i is the amplitude and k i is the observed rate constant characterizing the i th relaxation process , and n is the total number of observed relaxations . The value of n was either one ( single exponential ) or two ( double exponential ) . Uncertainties are reported as standard errors in the fits unless stated otherwise and were propagated using the general formula ( Eq . 2 ) : 7 by gu e s t on S e p t e m b e r 1 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m   ∂ ∂   ∂ ∂ + + = ) ( ) ( 2 2 1 1 ) ( n n . . . a x d x a x d x a d ( Eq . 2 ) , where the experimental measurements x 1 , x 2 … x n have uncertainties d ( x 1 ) , d ( x 2 ) … d ( x n ) and a is a function of x 1 , x 2 … x n .

Nucleotide binding kinetics : Time courses of nucleotide binding were acquired under pseudo first order conditions with [ nucleotide ] > > [ actomyosin ] ( 7 ) . Pyrene actomyosin - S1 samples were prepared by mixing myosin VI - S1 with a molar equivalent of pyrene actin and equilibrating at 25 ° C for at least 5 minutes . Apyrase ( 0 . 1 U mL - 1 final , potato Grade VII ) was added to ensure rigor ( no nucleotide ) conditions when indicated . Samples of pyrene actomyosin VI - HMM were prepared by first mixing myosin VI - HMM with 0 . 1 mM MgATP in a small volume ( ≤ 5 % of final volume ) then adding ( ≥ 0 . 95 volumes of ) a premixed solution of pyrene - actin and apyrase ( 0 . 5 U mL - 1 , potato Grade VII ) to hydrolyze any free ATP and ADP in solution . The final [ myosin VI - HMM heads ] / [ Actin ] was 0 . 1 . Equilibrium titrations : The stoichiometry of myosin VI binding to actin filaments was measured from the [ myosin ] - dependence of pyrene actin fluorescence quenching .

Steady - state fluorescence intensities were measured at 25 ( ± 1 ) ° C using a Photon Technologies Intl . ( New Brunswick , NJ ) Alphascan fluorescence spectrometer .

The titration curves define the stoichiometry better than they define the affinity because [ A o ] > > K d . Constraining F o to 1 , and F ∞ to the visually determined final fluorescence value yielded similar results for n . Kinetics of myosin VI binding to actin filaments : Kinetics of myosin VI binding to pyrene actin filaments was done under pseudo first order conditions with [ Actin ] ≥ 10 × [ myosin VI heads ] ( 7 ) . Apyrase ( 0 . 1 U mL - 1 ) was included in both actin and myosin samples to achieve rigor ( no nucleotide ) conditions .

Results A . Mechanism of MgATP binding to actomyosin VI - S1 . Myosin VI binding to actin filaments was assayed by monitoring the fluorescence of pyrene - labeled actin . In the absence of nucleotides or with bound ADP , myosin VI binds actin strongly and quenches the pyrene fluorescence by ~ 70 % ( 7 ) . ATP binding induces population of the weak - binding states , dissociates myosin VI from actin at the low actomyosin concentrations used , and recovers 100 % of the fluorescence of pyrene actin alone ( 7 ) . Therefore , ATP binding to actomyosin VI can be monitored from the fluorescence enhancement of pyrene actin . Time courses of pyrene fluorescence enhancement after mixing ATP with actomyosin VI follow single exponentials ( Figure 1A ) . The observed rate constants ( k obs ) depend hyperbolically on the ATP concentration ( Figure 1B ) , consistent with a two - step mechanism for ATP binding to actomyosin VI ( Scheme 1 ) : K 1 ’ k + 2 ’ k diss AM + ATP AM ( ATP ) A * M . ATP → A * + M . ATP ( Scheme 1 ) , k - 2 ’ where AM ( ATP ) is the collision complex in rapid equilibrium ( K 1 ’ = k + 1 ’ / k - 1 ’ , k - 1 ’ > > k + 2 ’ , and k + 1 ’ [ ATP ] + k - 1 ’ > > 1000 s - 1 ) with actomyosin ( AM ) and free nucleotide that 10 by gu e s t on S e p t e m b e r 1 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m isomerizes ( k + 2 ’ ) to an unquenched , weak binding state ( A * M . ATP ) that dissociates rapidly ( k diss > k + 2 ’ + k - 2 ’ ) from the filament ( 20 ) . At the low [ actin ] used , A * M . ATP dissociation can be considered essentially irreversible . The observed rate constant ( k obs ) for the formation of the weak binding states ( indicated by * in Scheme 1 ) , when the first step is a rapid equilibrium that generates no net fluorescence change and dissociation from actin is favored over ATP dissociation ( k diss > > k - 2 ’ , k - 2 ’ ~ 0 ) , depends hyperbolically on the [ ATP ] and the rate and equilibrium constants for binding according to Eq . 4 : ATP ] [ ' 1 ] ATP [ ' ' 1 2 1 obs   + = + K k K k ( Eq . 4 ) . The equilibrium constant for initial ATP binding ( 1 / K 1 ’ ) is 5 . 6 ( ± 0 . 7 ) mM , the maximum observed rate constant ( k max = k + 2 ’ ) is 176 . 5 ( ± 8 . 2 ) s - 1 , and the second order association rate constant ( K 1 ’ k + 2 ’ ) is 32 ( ± 4 ) mM - 1 s - 1 . Previous measurements done under a limited range of [ ATP ] ( up to 10 mM , Ref . 7 ) were linear and yielded a comparable association rate constant ( Figure 1B ) . At [ ATP ] > 3 mM , 100 % of the fluorescence is recovered , demonstrating that ATP binding can be considered to be essentially irreversible . From the [ ATP ] - dependence of the pyrene fluorescence change amplitudes , we estimate the overall apparent affinity for ATP binding to be ~ 300 µ M ( not shown ) . This is not a true equilibrium constant but represents the steady state [ ATP ] - dependence of the shift from strongly bound ( low fluorescence ) to weakly bound ( high fluorescence ) states . Though we did not account for changes in solution ionic strength , inclusion of an additional 0 . 1 M KCl has only minor effects on the observed rate constants ( data not 11 by gu e s t on S e p t e m b e r 1 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m shown ) , demonstrating that the observed hyperbolic [ ATP ] - dependence is unlikely to result from non - specific , common ion effects that arise at high nucleotide concentrations . B . Mechanism of MgADP binding to actomyosin VI - S1 . ADP binding to actomyosin VI does not generate a pyrene fluorescence change ( data not shown ) because myosin VI stays strongly bound to actin at the protein concentrations used , so it was measured by kinetic competition with ATP ( 24 - 28 ) . Using this approach the kinetics of ADP binding are monitored indirectly through its effects on the kinetics of ATP binding . The experimental design is straightforward : pyrene actomyosin VI in rigor is rapidly mixed with ATP ( see Figure 1 ) or a mixture of ATP and ADP . Analysis of the experimental data relies on the theory of parallel reactions ( 29 ) since both ATP and ADP are binding to available actomyosin sites . By maintaining the [ ATP ] constant and varying the [ ADP ] , contributions arising from ADP binding can be evaluated . Time courses of fluorescence enhancement after mixing ATP with pyrene actomyosin VI follow single exponentials ( Figure 1 ) . When a solution of ATP and ADP are mixed , time courses no longer follow single exponentials ( Figure 2 ) , but display fast ( < 100 ms , Figure 2A ) and slow ( 0 . 1 s – 10 s , Figure 2B ) phases that can be well fitted to double exponentials with observed rate constants ( Figure 3 ) and amplitudes ( Figure 4 ) that depend on the [ ADP ] . Because the rate constants of the fast and slow phases differ by more than an order of magnitude , the two relaxations can be considered uncoupled . Fast phase - The observed rate constant of the fast relaxation monitors depletion of free actomyosin and therefore depends on the [ ATP ] , [ ADP ] , and the rate and equilibrium constants for binding ( 29 ) . The hyperbolic [ ADP ] - dependence ( Figure 3A ) indicates that ADP binding , like ATP binding ( Figure 1B ) , is ( at least ) a two - step 12 by gu e s t on S e p t e m b e r 1 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m process . Therefore , the following parallel binding reaction mechanisms ( Scheme 2 ) describe competitive ATP and ADP binding to actomyosin VI ( AM ) : K 1 ’ k + 2 ’ k diss AM + ATP AM ( ATP ) A * M . ATP → A * + M . ATP + ADP k + 5b ’ k - 5b ’ AM ( ADP ) k + 5a ’ k - 5a ’ AM . ADP ( Scheme 2 ) , where A * denotes a high ( unquenched ) pyrene fluorescence , and the parentheses indicate collision complexes in rapid equilibrium with dissociated species ( the rate and equilibrium constants are named following the notation used in Ref . 7 ) . There is no analytical solution for the rate equations governing competitive binding of two ligands according to the two - step , reversible , parallel reaction mechanism depicted in Scheme 2 . However , if the collision complexes are in rapid equilibrium ( k - 1 ’ > > k + 2 ’ and k + 5b ’ > > k - 5a ’ ) and dissociation of bound nucleotides is negligible under the observed timescales so that binding can be considered essentially irreversible ( k - 2 ’ and k + 5a ’ ~ 0 , essentially fulfilled in this case , see below ) , the observed first order rate constant of fast phase relaxation ( k obs ) after mixing AM with a mixture of ATP and ADP depends on the sum of the observed rate constants for ATP ( k ATP ) and ADP ( k ADP ) binding : ADP ATP obs k k k + = ( Eq . 5 ) , where        + + = + ] ADP [ ' ] ATP [ ' 1 ] ATP [ ' ' b5 1 2 1 ATP K K k K k ( Eq . 6 ) 13 by gu e s t on S e p t e m b e r 1 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m and   + + = ] ADP [ ' ] ATP [ ' 1 ] ADP [ ' ' b5 1 5a - b5 ADP K K k K k ( Eq . 7 ) , with the association equilibrium constant K 5b ’ = k - 5b ’ / k + 5b ’ . The additional terms in the denominators ( compare Eqs 4 and 6 ) account for competition between ATP and ADP for binding to AM . K 1 ’ [ ATP ] accounts for the fraction of AM in AM ( ATP ) , K 5b ’ [ ADP ] reflects AM ( ADP ) and the 1 represents AM . Combining terms yields Eq . 5 in terms of the rate and equilibrium constants defined in Scheme 2 :   + + + = + ] ADP [ ' ] ATP [ ' 1 ] ADP [ ' ' ] ATP [ ' ' b5 1 5a - b5 2 1 obs K K k K k K k ( Eq . 8 ) . Because K 1 ’ and k + 2 ’are known from independent determinations ( Figure 1B ) , the two unknowns in Eq . 8 are K 5b ’ , the equilibrium constant for weak ADP binding , and k - 5a ’ , the rate of AM ( ADP ) isomerization . Fitting the plot of k obs versus [ ADP ] ( Figure 3A ) to Eq . 8 yields a k - 5a ’ of 366 ( ± 32 ) s - 1 and 1 / K 5b ’ of 2 . 2 ( ± 0 . 5 ) mM . The second order association rate constant for ADP binding ( K 5b ’ k - 5a ’ ) is 0 . 17 ( ± 0 . 03 ) µ M - 1 s - 1 , which agrees with the value obtained with mantADP ( 0 . 18 ( ± 0 . 03 ) µ M - 1 s - 1 ) over a limited nucleotide concentration range ( 7 ) . Slow phase - The new equilibrium approached in the fast phase of the reaction ( Figure 2 ) is not a true equilibrium , but a transient distribution reflecting the kinetic partitioning of actomyosin into ATP - and ADP - bound states that eventually redistributes to equilibrium governed by the affinities and concentrations of nucleotides . Because the final ( > 3 s ) amplitude is the same in the presence and absence of ADP ( Figure 2B ) , equilibrium favors formation of the weakly bound , high fluorescence states ( A * M . ATP and M * ATP ) under all nucleotide conditions examined . The slow phase of the reaction 14 by gu e s t on S e p t e m b e r 1 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m must therefore arise from AM . ADP formed during kinetic partitioning in the fast phase that dissociates bound ADP then binds ATP to populate the high fluorescence states . When ATP binding is irreversible ( k diss > > k - 2 ’ ~ 0 , as for actomyosin VI ) and more rapid than ADP release ( k ATP > > k + 5a ’ ) , the observed rate constant depends on the rate constants for ADP release and nucleotide binding : ) ( ' 5 obs ADP ATP ATP a k k k k k + = + ( Eq . 9 ) , which reflects the rate constant of ADP dissociation ( k + 5a ’ ) times the probability that ATP will bind ( k ATP / ( k ATP + k ADP ) ) . Eq . 9 predicts that k obs gets slower as [ ADP ] increases because the probability of ADP rebinding is higher ( i . e . k ADP increases ) . When ATP binding is favored over ADP binding ( k ATP > > k ADP and k ADP ~ 0 , achieved when [ ATP ] > > [ ADP ] and [ ADP ] is low ) , ADP release is essentially irreversible and Eq . 9 simplifies to : ' ( Eq . 10 ) ' 5 5 obs a ATP ATP a k k k k k + + = = and the observed rate constant yields the rate of ADP release from actomyosin ( k + 5a ’ ) . The value of k + 5a ’ can be readily obtained by extrapolation of a plot of k obs vs . [ ADP ] ( Figure 3B ) to the limit of [ ADP ] = 0 ( i . e . the intercept ) . The rate constant of ADP release ( k + 5a ’ ) obtained from the intercept of the best fit of the data is 5 . 7 ( ± 0 . 3 ) s - 1 ( Figure 3B ) , in agreement the value of 5 . 6 ( ± 0 . 2 ) s - 1 measured with mantADP ( 7 ) and by competitive displacement after mixing actomyosin VI - ADP with a large excess of ATP ( 8 s - 1 , data not shown ) . 15 by gu e s t on S e p t e m b e r 1 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m The overall K d for ADP binding ( 1 / ( K 5b ’ K 5a ’ ) ) to actomyosin VI calculated from the ratio of the rate constants ( k + 5a ’ / K 5b ’ k - 5a ’ ) is 34 ( ± 8 ) µ M ( Table 1 ) , in close agreement with the value estimated with mantADP ( 30 ( ± 5 ) µ M , Ref . 7 ) . Amplitudes - The pyrene fluorescence change is proportional to the concentration of weakly - bound A * M . ATP and M * ATP . The amplitude of the fast phase is proportional to the concentration of weakly - bound myosin heads populated during the initial kinetic partitioning . The relative amplitude reflects the probability of ATP binding over ADP ( k ATP / ( k ATP + k ADP ) ) , and therefore becomes smaller when ADP is present and competes with ATP for binding ( Figure 2A ) . The relative amplitudes of the fast and slow phases ( Figure 4 ) are proportional to the rate constants for nucleotide binding and reflect the partitioning into strongly bound actomyosin - ADP and weakly bound myosin - ATP states at any given [ ADP ] and [ ATP ] . Because the association rate constant for ADP binding ( K 5b ’k - 5a ’ ) is ~ 5 times greater than ATP binding ( K 1 ’k + 2 ’ ) , actomyosin VI partitions equally into weak and strong binding states at [ ADP ] / [ ATP ] of ~ 0 . 2 even though equilibrium favors ATP binding . Simulations of reaction time courses - Kinetic simulations using Scheme 2 and our experimentally determined rate constants for ATP and ADP binding ( Table 1 ) account for the observed rates and amplitudes of the fast and slow phases of the time courses ( Figure 2B inset ) , demonstrating that the analysis and interpretation of the pyrene actin kinetic competition assay presented are valid . C . Equilibrium titration of pyrene actin and myosin VI - HMM . The stoichiometries ( n ) of myosin VI and myosin VI - ADP binding to actin filaments were measured from the [ myosin ] - dependence of pyrene actin fluorescence quenching ( Figure 16 by gu e s t on S e p t e m b e r 1 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m 5 ) . Myosin - heads with no bound nucleotide or with bound ADP bind actin strongly and quench the pyrene fluorescence . Myosin VI - S1 quenches the pyrene actin fluorescence stoichiometrically ( n = 0 . 95 ± 0 . 02 heads per actin ) to ~ 25 % of the fluorescence of pyrene actin alone in agreement with previous reports ( 7 ) . Myosin VI - HMM maximally quenches the pyrene fluorescence ~ 50 % with a stoichiometry ( n ) of 0 . 74 ( ± 0 . 08 ) strongly bound heads per actin in rigor and 0 . 89 ( ± 0 . 09 ) in the presence of ADP .

The time courses of fluorescence quenching after mixing pyrene actin with myosin VI - HMM or myosin VI - HMM - ADP follow single exponentials ( Figure 6A ) with observed rate constants that depend linearly on the [ Actin ] ( Figure 6B ) . Though HMM binding to actin filaments is likely to be ( at least ) a two - step process ( 30 ) with the heads binding sequentially , we could not resolve two phases , presumably because attachment of the second head is very rapid , so binding was modeled as simple one - step , bimolecular reactions ( Schemes 3 and 4 ) : k - 6 A * + M AM ( Scheme 3 ) , k + 6 k - 10 A * + MD AMD k + 10 ( Scheme 4 ) . Representing two - headed binding as a single kinetic transition is the same as assuming the two heads bind actin simultaneously . Because binding of each head is not explicitly considered in the reaction mechanism ( 31 ) , the second - order association rate constants for actin binding ( k - 6 and k - 10 ) should be considered apparent rate constants that describe the overall process of myosin VI - HMM binding to actin filaments . 17 by gu e s t on S e p t e m b e r 1 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m The association rate constants for actin filament binding obtained from the slopes of the lines generated by plotting k obs vs . [ Actin ] ( Figure 6B ) are 6 . 2 ( ± 0 . 3 ) µ M - 1 s - 1 for myosin VI - HMM ( k - 6 ) and 2 . 7 ( ± 0 . 2 ) µ M - 1 s - 1 for myosin VI - HMM - ADP ( k - 10 ) . The rate constants for myosin VI - S1 and myosin VI - HMM binding to actin filaments differ by less than a factor of two ( Table 1 ) . Statistical factors that arise from having two binding sites ( i . e . heads ) per HMM molecule do not contribute to the experimentally determined rate constants because experiments are performed under pseudo - first order conditions with [ Actin ] > [ HMM ] so the [ heads ] is not included in the rate expression . The intercepts yield dissociation rate constants ( k + 6 and k + 10 ) of ~ 0 . 2 ( ± 0 . 1 ) s - 1 in the presence and absence of ADP . The dissociation rate constants obtained from the intercepts are subject to large uncertainty because they are close to zero , so dissociation from pyrene actin filaments was measured by competition with a large molar excess of unlabeled actin . Because dissociation from pyrene actin is rate - limiting and essentially irreversible under our experimental conditions , time courses of fluorescence enhancement reflect the rate constant of pyrene actomyosin VI - HMM dissociation . Time courses of fluorescence enhancements fit single exponentials reasonably well ( Figure 7A ) and yield actomyosin VI - HMM dissociation rate constant of 0 . 004 ( ± < 0 . 001 ) s - 1 both in rigor ( k + 6 ) and with bound ADP ( k + 10 ) . Residuals of the best fits are not random but display a “ringing” characteristic of a poor fit of the data ( Figure 7B ) . Fitting to a double exponential yields a significantly better fit as indicated by the randomly distributed residuals ( Figure 7C ) . The best fit to a double exponential yields two relaxations of comparable amplitudes with rate constants that differ by a factor of six ( k obs1 = 0 . 006 s - 1 , A 1 = 0 . 6 , k obs2 = 0 . 001 s - 1 , A 2 18 by gu e s t on S e p t e m b e r 1 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m = 0 . 4 ) both in the presence and absence of 2 mM ADP . Similar biphasic behavior with rates that differ by a factor of six with amplitudes of fast and slow phases comparable to those observed here has also been reported for skeletal muscle myosin II - HMM ( 23 ) . To estimate the apparent overall affinity of myosin VI - HMM for actin filaments , we treat dissociation of both heads as a single kinetic process since the two observed rate constants differ by less than an order of magnitude , even though this is not accurate kinetic mechanism for HMM binding to actin filaments ( 31 ) . The apparent K d ‘s calculated from the ratio of the association and dissociation rate constants are 0 . 6 ( ± 0 . 2 ) nM for actomyosin VI - HMM ( 1 / K 6 ) and 1 . 9 ( ± 0 . 4 ) nM for actomyosin VI - HMM - ADP ( 1 / K 10 ) . These values for actin binding affinities are comparable to that of actomyosin VI - S1 in rigor ( ~ 1 nM , Ref . 7 ) but stronger than S1 binding in the presence of ADP ( ~ 50 nM , Ref . 7 ) . E . Mechanism of MgATP binding to actomyosin VI - HMM . Time courses of ATP binding to actomyosin VI - HMM with both heads strongly bound to pyrene actin filaments ( binding density of 0 . 1 heads / actin to minimize site occlusion , see Discussion ) display fast ( < 0 . 1 s ) and slow ( 0 . 1 - 2 s ) phases that can be fitted to double exponentials ( Figure 8A ) with observed rate constants that depend hyperbolically on [ MgATP ] ( Figure 8B & 8C ) . The [ ATP ] needed to half saturate the rate constant of the fast phase ( 1 / K 1 ’ ) is 1 . 0 ( ± 0 . 2 ) mM , over five - fold lower than that of single - headed myosin VI ( 5 . 6 ± 0 . 7 mM ; Figure 1B , Table 1 ) . The maximum rate ( k + 2 ’ ) of ATP binding to actomyosin VI - HMM ( 78 . 0 ± 4 . 1 s - 1 ) is approximately half that of ATP binding to actomyosin VI - S1 ( 176 . 5 ( ± 8 . 2 ) s - 1 ; Figure 1B , Table 1 ) . ATP binds myosin VI - HMM with a second order 19 by gu e s t on S e p t e m b e r 1 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m association rate constant ( K 1 ’ k + 2 ’ ) of 78 ( ± 16 ) mM - 1 s - 1 which is ~ 2 . 5 fold faster than for actomyosin VI - S1 ( Table 1 ) . The slow phase also displays a hyperbolic [ ATP ] - dependence with a maximum rate of ~ 6 s - 1 ( Figure 8C ) , ~ 30 - fold slower than the rate of ATP binding to actomyosin VI - S1 ( Figure 1 ) , but comparable to the rate of ADP release from actomyosin VI - S1 ( 5 . 7 ± 0 . 7 s - 1 , Figure 3B ) . The value of 1 / K 1 ’ is ~ 6 mM , comparable to that of actomyosin VI - S1 ( Figure 1B ) . The intercept obtained from the best fit of all the data to a rectangular hyperbola is largely uncertain ( 0 . 5 ± 0 . 7 s - 1 ) and cannot be distinguished with confidence from the origin . Time courses of ATP - induced actomyosin VI - HMM dissociation as assayed by light scattering displayed a slow phase with a rate constant of ~ 4 s - 1 and a second slower component at ~ 0 . 4 s - 1 ( Figure 8C inset ) . The relative amplitudes of the fast and slow phases did not show a strong dependence on [ ATP ] . At concentrations above 1 mM the slow phase amplitude was ~ 30 % of the total amplitude ( Figure 8A ) in experiments performed on separate days with different myosin VI - HMM preparations . F . Mechanism of MgADP binding to actomyosin VI - HMM . ADP binding to actomyosin VI - HMM was measured by kinetic competition with ATP ( Figure 9 ) . The observed rate constant of the fast phase ( Figure 9A ) depends hyperbolically on the [ ADP ] over the concentration range examined . A broader range could not be examined due to the low signal coming from having only 10 % heads strongly bound to actin and because the amplitude of the fast phase gets smaller as ADP is added . The best fit to Eq . 8 yields values of 0 . 24 ( ± 0 . 06 ) mM for the weak nucleotide binding affinity ( 1 / K 5b ’ ) and 504 ( ± 75 ) s - 1 for the isomerization rate ( k - 5a ’ ) . The second order association rate constant for 20 by gu e s t on S e p t e m b e r 1 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m ADP binding to actomyosin VI - HMM ( K 5b ’ k - 5a ’ ) is 2 . 1 ( ± 0 . 6 ) µ M - 1 s - 1 , over an order of magnitude faster than to actomyosin VI - S1 ( Table 1 ) . The faster association rate constant is largely due to a 10 - fold higher affinity for ADP in the collision complex ( 1 / K 5b ’ ; Table 1 ) . The slow phase became slower as ADP was added ( Figure 9B ) as expected . The rate constant for ADP dissociation ( k + 5a ’ ) obtained from the intercept of the best fit to Eq . 9 is 5 . 5 ( ± 0 . 5 ) s - 1 , similar to actomyosin VI - S1 ( Figure 3B ) , demonstrating that ADP release is not accelerated when both heads of myosin VI - HMM are strongly bound to actin . The overall K d for ADP binding ( 1 / ( K 5b ’ K 5a ’ ) ) calculated from the ratio of rates ( k + 5a ’ / K 5b ’ k - 5a ’ ) is 2 . 6 ( ± 0 . 8 ) µ M , indicating that ADP binds myosin VI - HMM with both heads strongly bound to actin with > 10 - fold higher affinity than S1 ( Table 1 ) . 21 by gu e s t on S e p t e m b e r 1 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m Discussion MgADP binding measured by kinetic competition . We have used kinetic competition to measure ADP binding to pyrene actomyosin VI . Unlike skeletal muscle myosin where ADP binding is weak and in rapid equilibrium ( 4 , 32 ) , actomyosin VI binds ADP tightly with slow dissociation kinetics ( 7 ) . The analysis of kinetic competition used in this work permits extraction of the ATP and ADP association rate constants , the ADP dissociation rate constant , as well as the relative and absolute ( ADP ) affinities for binding to pyrene actomyosin . The methods of data acquisition and analysis described should be applicable to any myosin with a high ADP affinity that quenches the fluorescence of pyrene actin when strongly bound . Mechanism of MgATP and MgADP binding to actomyosin VI - S1 . Both MgATP and MgADP bind actomyosin VI - S1 following a two - step reaction mechanism with a weak , rapid equilibrium collision complex that isomerizes to a conformational state with high nucleotide affinity ( Scheme 2 ) . There are however , significant differences in the kinetics of how the two nucleotides bind . The equilibrium constant for weak binding is ~ 3 - fold tighter and the isomerization rate constant ~ 2 - fold faster with bound ADP than with ATP . As a result , ADP binds ~ 5 times more rapidly than ATP ( at identical concentrations ) as reflected in the initial kinetic partitioning after mixing with a solution of ATP and ADP ( Figure 4 ) . The isomerization with bound ADP may reflect the ADP - induced conformational change observed by cryo - electron microscopy ( 33 ) . Actomyosin VI - S1 binds both ATP and ADP with weak collision complex affinities ( K 1 ’ and K 5b ’ ; Table 1 ) . The affinity of the AM ( ATP ) complex is significantly weaker than other myosins characterized under comparable ionic conditions and 22 by gu e s t on S e p t e m b e r 1 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m temperatures ( Table 1 , see also Refs . 10 , 13 , 23 , 27 , 35 ) suggesting that the binding site of actomyosin VI is not readily accessible or that the nucleotide dissociates rapidly after encounter . Our data cannot distinguish between these two mechanisms . However , the fact that both nucleotides bind actomyosin VI very weakly in the collision complex suggests that similar structural elements may inhibit the binding of both ATP and ADP . Unfavorable conformations of the P - loop and / or a unique amino acid insert ( residues ~ 280 to ~ 300 ) near the nucleotide - binding site of myosin VI could potentially interfere with productive nucleotide binding . The dissociation equilibrium constant for weak nucleotide binding is larger for ATP than ADP ( 1 / K 1 ’ > 1 / K 5b ’ ) . Simple steric interference from the gamma phosphate sensor ( i . e . Switch II , and possibly elements of Switch I ) may account for the difference between the two nucleotides . Alternatively , if contributions from electrostatic repulsion at the active site were significant , the higher charge density of ATP would lower the probability of productive binding . The relative insensitivity to changes in solution ionic strength argues against this possibility . It is worth noting that ATP binding to myosin VI - S1 is reduced 10 - fold by actin filaments but ADP binding and release are minimally affected ( 7 ) , suggesting that actin binding alters the conformation of the gamma phosphate sensor and favors ADP binding over ATP binding , contributing to the high duty ratio of actomyosin VI . Myosin VI - HMM binding to actin filaments . Myosin VI - HMM maximally quenches the pyrene fluorescence ~ 50 % with a stoichiometry approaching , but not reaching , one head per actin subunit ( n = 0 . 74 ( ± 0 . 08 ) strongly bound heads per actin in rigor and 0 . 89 ( ± 0 . 09 ) in the presence of ADP , Figure 5 , Table 1 ) . In contrast , myosin 23 by gu e s t on S e p t e m b e r 1 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m VI - S1 quenches 75 % of the fluorescence with a stoichiometry of 0 . 95 ( ± 0 . 02 ) heads per actin . We interpret this to mean that both heads of myosin VI - HMM bind actin strongly in rigor and with bound ADP , but that fully saturating the filament is difficult because all of the binding sites are not accessible . Occlusion of vacant sites on a filament presumably arises because of steric hindrance from other myosin VI - HMM molecules bound to the filament . Such a mechanism would require that the two heads of myosin VI - HMM not bind adjacent actin subunits in a filament preferentially , but span multiple sites along a filament . Myosin VI with the two heads bound to noncontiguous actin subunits were observed by electron microscopy of partially decorated filaments ( 17 ) , consistent with our interpretation . It is important to note , however , that in the presence of ADP the maximum quenching is smaller but the stoichiometry higher , suggesting that ADP binding may generate a mixed population of acto - HMM molecules , some with only one head strongly - bound . In principle , saturation of the filament is also complicated by the fact that a single myosin VI - HMM molecule possesses two binding sites , and therefore requires that two ( adjacent or proximal ) actin subunits be available for binding ( at the low [ actin ] used the two heads of myosin VI - HMM are unlikely to be binding different filaments ) . As a filament becomes more heavily decorated , the number of adjacent or proximal sites available for binding decreases to a greater extent than the total number of vacant sites ( 37 ) . However , if the two heads of myosin VI - HMM were binding adjacent actin subunits , as is thought to occur with skeletal and smooth muscle myosin - HMM ( 31 ) , near full saturation would be readily achieved ( 30 ) , consistent with occlusion of vacant sites 24 by gu e s t on S e p t e m b e r 1 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m because the two heads of myosin VI - HMM are preferentially binding to noncontiguous subunits in a filament . The second head of myosin - HMM is expected to increase the overall binding affinity for actin filaments ( 30 ) . In the presence of ADP , the affinity of myosin VI - HMM is ~ 25 – fold stronger than myosin VI - S1 ( ~ 2 nM for the HMM and ~ 50 nM for the S1 , Table 1 , Ref . 7 ) , comparable to the difference measured for skeletal muscle myosin II - HMM with bound ADP ( 31 ) . The higher binding affinity of the HMM results primarily from a slower dissociation rate constant ( Table 1 ) . We observed minimal contributions of the second head of myosin VI - HMM to the actin affinity under rigor conditions ( Table 1 ) even though both heads are binding strongly , suggesting that that strongly bound heads of myosin VI - HMM in rigor may be under internal strain ( 38 ) . Alternatively , one head may be strongly bound in a manner similar to S1 and the second in a different conformation that binds actin more weakly but still quenches pyrene fluorescence . The comparable actin filament dissociation rate constant ( in rigor ) of the S1 and HMM favors the latter mechanism . Mechanism of ATP and ADP binding to actomyosin VI - HMM . In the presence of millimolar ATP , myosin VI walks processively along an actin filament ( 7 , 16 - 18 ) . Mixing ATP with actomyosin VI - HMM ( with both heads strongly bound ) generates a pyrene fluorescence enhancement , indicating that the predominant steady - state intermediate populated during processive stepping does not have both heads strongly bound to actin . If myosin VI - HMM dwelled predominantly with both heads strongly - bound to actin during a processive run , no net change in pyrene fluorescence would be observed upon addition of ATP . Such a mechanism for processive stepping is consistent 25 by gu e s t on S e p t e m b e r 1 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m with models for myosin VI processive motility that implicate a predominant steady - state intermediate having only one head strongly bound to actin ( 7 , 20 ) . ATP binding to actomyosin VI is accelerated 2 . 5 - fold and ADP binding is accelerated > 10 - fold ( Table 1 ) by the second head of actomyosin VI - HMM . Presumably , intramolecular stress between the strongly - bound heads introduces strain and alters the conformation of the nucleotide binding pocket ( 1 , 13 , 14 ) and modulates the kinetics of nucleotide binding . Rate - limiting ADP release ( 7 ) is not affected , so the overall affinity for ADP binding is favored > 10 - fold when both heads are strongly bound . We favor the following model ( Figure 10 ) to account for the observed rates and amplitudes of the biphasic fluorescence changes observed after mixing with ATP . At the start of the experiment myosin VI - HMM has both heads strongly bound to noncontiguous actin subunits as indicated by the equilibrium titrations ( Figure 5 ) . Despite uncertainty in defining the nucleotide states of the heads , there is general agreement ( 7 , 18 ) that the trailing head of myosin VI under our conditions is nucleotide - free and the lead head , under negative strain from the trailing head , has ADP in its active site . ATP binds rapidly ( fast phase ) to the nucleotide - free trailing head , dissociating it from actin and increasing the pyrene fluorescence ( high pyrene fluorescence state indicated by * ) . Completion of the power - stroke or strain relaxation swings the trailing head forward to the next binding site towards the pointed end of the actin filament . Hydrolysis is assumed to be rapid ( i . e . faster than rate - limiting ADP release , though it has not been directly measured ) generating the predominant steady - state intermediate with a lead ADP - P i head that equilibrates between attached ( weakly bound and engaged ) and detached states ( 7 , 20 ) . The probability that myosin VI - HMM will take a successful step 26 by gu e s t on S e p t e m b e r 1 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m rather than dissociate from a filament depends on the rate and equilibrium constants for lead head attachment ( 7 ) . We interpret the slow phase observed in the pyrene fluorescence and light scattering ( 4 s - 1 , Figure 8C inset ) transients as the population of myosin VI - HMM molecules that release both heads from actin and terminate a processive run ( Figure 10 ) . If all myosin VI - HMM molecules dissociated from actin at the concentrations used , our model ( Figure 10 ) predicts the fast and slow phases would be equal in amplitude . The fact that the slow phase amplitude is smaller than that of the fast phase indicates that some of the heads remain strongly bound to the filament . The final amplitudes of the transients therefore reflect the sum of the population of molecules undergoing a processive run ( single - head attached ) and those with both heads detached . Under our conditions some of the HMM molecules are expected to be undergoing processive runs ( with one head strongly bound to actin ) because the actin filament concentration ( 300 nM ) is near the K ATPase for steady - state cycling ( ~ 600 nM ; Ref . 7 ) , accounting for the smaller relative amplitude of the slow phase . Myosin VI molecules that remained attached to the filament pointed ends would also contribute to a smaller slow phase . Implications for processivity . Proposed models of myosin VI processivity ( 7 , 16 , 18 , 20 ) implicate a predominant steady - state intermediate with either one or two heads strongly bound to actin . Under conditions suitable for processive stepping ( millimolar ATP , no applied load ) , myosin VI does not dwell with both heads strongly bound to actin as indicated by the pyrene fluorescence enhancement , consistent with models implicating the second head of myosin VI - HMM in inhibiting strong binding of the lead head to actin ( 7 , 20 ) . When both heads are strongly bound to actin , the rate constants for nucleotide 27 by gu e s t on S e p t e m b e r 1 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m binding are greater . It has been proposed that the lead head of myosin VI with bound ADP . P i equilibrates between detached and “engaged” actin binding states ( 7 , 20 ) . We hypothesize that during processive stepping , lead head “engagement” may facilitate nucleotide binding to the trailing head comparable to the effect measured here for two strongly bound heads of myosin VI . 28 by gu e s t on S e p t e m b e r 1 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m Acknowledgements We thank Drs .
