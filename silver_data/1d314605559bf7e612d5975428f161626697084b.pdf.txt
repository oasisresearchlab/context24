Several adhesion molecules are known to be important for dendrite self - avoidance , but the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely defined . Here we show that FMI - 1 / Flamingo , an atypical cadherin , is required autonomously for self - avoidance in the multidendritic PVD neuron of C . elegans . The fmi - 1 mutant shows increased crossover between sister PVD dendrites . Our genetic analysis suggests that FMI - 1 promotes transient F - actin assembly at the tips of contacting sister dendrites to facilitate their efficient retraction during self - avoidance events , likely by interacting with WSP - 1 / N - WASP . Mutations of vang - 1 , which encodes the planar cell polarity protein Vangl2 previously shown to inhibit F - actin assembly , suppress self - avoidance defects of the fmi - 1 mutant . FMI - 1 downregulates VANG - 1 level likely through forming protein complexes . Our study identifies molecular links between Flamingo and the F - actin cytoskeleton for efficient dendrite self - avoidance . D e v e l o p m e n t • A cc e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t INTRODUCTION Dendrite self - avoidance prevents crossover between sister dendrites from the same neuron , maximizing coverage of the sensory territory of individual dendrites with minimal overlapping ( Zipursky and Grueber , 2013 ) . In mammals , defects in dendrite self - avoidance are associated with abnormal gait patterns or impaired directional sensitivity in vision , suggesting that self - avoidance is essential for proper functioning of the neural circuitries ( Gibson et al . , 2014 ; Kostadinov and Sanes , 2015 ) . Many molecules have been identified as important regulators for dendrite self - avoidance in diverse species , including Down syndrome cell adhesion molecules ( Dscams ) ( Hughes et al . , 2007 ; Matthews et al . , 2007 ; Soba et al . , 2007 ) , γ - protocadherins ( Lefebvre et al . , 2012 ) , integrins ( Han et al . , 2012 ; Kim et al . , 2012 ) , the atypical cadherin Flamingo and the transmembrane polarity protein Van Gogh ( Matsubara et al . , 2011 ) , the immunoglobulin superfamily protein Turtle ( Long et al . , 2009 ) , the secreted proteins Netrin and Slit ( Gibson et al . , 2014 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ; Sundararajan et al . , 2019 ) , the furin - like protease KPC - 1 ( Salzberg et al . , 2014 ) , and the Wnt - secretory factor Wntless ( Liao et al . , 2018 ) . The signaling pathways through which these molecules control self - avoidance are incompletely defined . A critical observation made by live imaging in the nematode C . elegans indicates that dendrite self - avoidance occurs through contact - dependent dendrite retraction ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) . This finding is consistent with the fact that the majority of self - avoidance molecules are cell membrane proteins and several of these display homophilic interactions ( Goodman et al . , 2016 ; Rubinstein et al . , 2015 ; Wojtowicz et al . , 2007 ) . It is less clear what drives subsequent dendrite retraction after the initial transient contact between sister dendrite branches . Recently , F - actin assembly has emerged as a potential cytoskeletal platform that integrates signaling from the plasma membrane to promote self - avoidance . In C . elegans , UNC - 6 / Netrin signaling and D e v e l o p m e n t • A cc e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t Wntless engage F - actin assembly to promote dendrite self - avoidance ( Liao et al . , 2018 ; Sundararajan et al . , 2019 ) . The Netrin receptor UNC - 40 / DCC ( Deleted in Colon Cancer ) contains a conserved motif for direct interaction with the WAVE regulatory complex ( WRC ) , providing a molecular link between Netrin signaling and F - actin assembly ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) . Wntless genetically interacts with neural Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome Protein ( N - WASP ) , a conserved actin regulator ( Derivery and Gautreau , 2010 ) , further strengthening the idea that F - actin dynamics plays an important role in mediating contact - dependent dendrite repulsion ( Liao et al . , 2018 ) . Flamingo is an atypical cadherin that has seven transmembrane domains , making it structurally reminiscent of a G - protein coupled receptor ( GPCR ) ( Langenhan et al . , 2016 ) . In Drosophila , Flamingo promotes self - avoidance of sister dendrites from the same larval class IV dendrite arborization ( da ) neuron ( Matsubara et al . , 2011 ) . Flamingo binds the LIM domain protein Espinas and also genetically interacts with the small GTPase RhoA and Van Gogh , molecules that govern planar cell polarity ( PCP ) across epithelial tissues ( Matsubara et al . , 2011 ) . As RhoA is a well - studied regulator of F - actin dynamics , it is tempting to speculate that Flamingo promotes dendrite self - avoidance by engaging F - actin assembly . In the current study , we provide experimental evidence that FMI - 1 , the C . elegans Flamingo , genetically interacts with WSP - 1 / N - WASP and likely regulates dendrite self - avoidance by orchestrating spatially and temporally defined F - actin activity at the dendrite tips . Our data further suggest that FMI - 1 antagonizes , rather than collaborates with , VANG - 1 / Van Gogh in dendrite repulsion . These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms by which Flamingo shapes the fine architecture of dendrite arborization . D e v e l o p m e n t • A cc e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t RESULTS C . elegans FMI - 1 / Flamingo Regulates Dendrite Self - Avoidance To understand how dendrite self - avoidance is regulated at the molecular and cellular level , we focus on PVD , a bilaterally symmetric , multidendritic nociceptive neuron in C . elegans that has extensive dendrite arborization ( Fig . 1A ) . PVD elaborates peripheral branches orthogonal to the more proximal dendrites , forming a stereotyped , menorah - like dendrite morphology ( Albeg et al . , 2011 ; Oren - Suissa et al . , 2010 ; Smith et al . , 2010 ) . The horizontal 3° branches display robust self - avoidance , leaving gaps of variable length with minimal contact or crossover between sister 3° dendrites ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) . The C . elegans gene fmi - 1 encodes Flamingo , an atypical cadherin with enormous extracellular domains , seven transmembrane domains and a short cytoplasmic tail ( Fig . 1B ) ( Steimel et al . , 2010 ) . The fmi - 1 ( rh308 ) allele , a nonsense mutation predicted to truncate most of the FMI - 1 protein ( Steimel et al . , 2010 ) , displayed increased self - avoidance defects compared to those of the control , with 3° dendrites in contact with each other and missing gaps between them ( Fig . 1B , C ) . Another nonsense allele , hd121 ( Steimel et al . , 2010 ) , showed similar phenotypes ( Fig . 1B , D ) , suggesting that self - avoidance defects in these mutants are likely caused by loss of fmi - 1 gene activity . Trans - heterozygotes between fmi - 1 ( rh308 ) and nDf42 , a deficiency chromosome that deletes the entire fmi - 1 locus , showed self - avoidance defects similar to those of the fmi - 1 ( rh308 ) homozygotes ( Fig . 1D ) , suggesting that rh308 is a null allele of fmi - 1 . Gross PVD dendrite morphology of the fmi - 1 ( rh308 ) mutant was indistinguishable from that of the control ( Fig . S1 ) . As rh308 is a putative null mutation , we focus the rest of our investigation on this allele . Prior studies suggest that growing PVD 3° dendrites briefly contact each other and promptly retract , typically within 3 - 5 minutes after the initial contact ( Liao et al . , D e v e l o p m e n t • A cc e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t 2018 ; Smith et al . , 2012 ) . To gain insight into the cellular basis of self - avoidance defects in the fmi - 1 mutant , we performed live imaging by spinning - disk confocal microscopy in third - stage ( L3 ) larvae when dendrite self - avoidance is being established ( Smith et al . , 2012 ) . Consistent with published literature , we found that contact of 3° dendrites was resolved by dendrite retraction within 3 minutes in more than 60 % of the contact events , with more than 90 % of contact events resolved in 10 minutes ( Fig . 1E , F , Video S1 ) . By contrast , in the fmi - 1 mutant , 3° dendrites remained in contact for 10 minutes or longer in more than 60 % of the events ( Fig . 1E , F , Video S2 ) . As defects in self - avoidance scored in late L4 fmi - 1 animals are considerably less penetrant than dendrites in contact in our live imaging experiments , it is possible that some contacting events are resolved at later time points beyond our live imaging sessions . Possible interference of dendrite development may arise from worm manipulation , immobilization or phototoxicity during live imaging . Low concentration of levamisole and microbeads were used to minimize toxicity possibly caused by immobilization , and we tried to reduce phototoxicity by using spinning - disk confocal microscopy that markedly shortened image acquisition time . Taken together , these data suggest that fmi - 1 regulates self - avoidance by promoting efficient retraction after transient contact of the 3° dendrites . Consistent with prior reports ( Huarcaya Najarro and Ackley , 2013 ; Steimel et al . , 2010 ) , we found that fmi - 1 was expressed throughout the C . elegans nervous system at all stages of development , revealed by a high - dose translational FMI - 1 : : GFP reporter that contains the 2615 bp fmi - 1 promoter and the genomic fmi - 1 sequence injected at 30 ng / µ l of DNA concentration ( twnEx458 ; Fig . 2A ) . FMI - 1 : : GFP was enriched in the nerve ring and the ventral nerve cord ( Fig . 2A ) , highlighting the role of FMI - 1 in axon and synapse development . We would like to note that these findings do not exclude low level of fmi - 1 expression in non - neural tissues that is below the D e v e l o p m e n t • A cc e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t detection threshold of our transgene . FMI - 1 : : GFP showed membrane enrichment in the cell body of PVD ( Fig . 2B ) . Punctate FMI - 1 : : GFP could also be found in the 1° dendrites and occasionally in the 2° or 3° dendrites ( Fig . 2C ) . The low signal - to - noise ratio of FMI - 1 : : GFP in peripheral PVD branches precluded verification of possible FMI - 1 localization to the tips of growing 3° dendrites . Even at such marginal signal intensity , this transgene caused self - avoidance defects in an otherwise wild - type genetic background ( control , median = 2 . 9 % ( 2 . 3 - 7 . 9 % ) , n = 11 ; twnEx458 , median = 8 . 2 % ( 0 - 21 . 7 % ) , n = 12 , p < 0 . 05 , Mann - Whitney U test ) . Another Pfmi - 1 : : FMI - 1 : : GFP transgene that was expressed at lower dosage ( 10 ng / µ l of DNA injected ; twnEx423 ) fully rescued self - avoidance defects of the fmi - 1 mutant ( Fig . 2D ) , and it did not cause self - avoidance defects in the control background . Because the 3° dendrites of PVD are not associated with other neuronal processes ( Dong et al . , 2013 ) , and fmi - 1 is specifically expressed in neurons , including PVD , we speculate that FMI - 1 acts autonomously to promote PVD dendrite self - avoidance . As a definitive test , we expressed the fmi - 1a transcript in PVD , and confirmed that the dendrite self - avoidance defects of the fmi - 1 mutant were completely rescued ( Fig . 2E ) . These data suggest that fmi - 1 acts cell - autonomously in PVD to regulate dendrite self - avoidance . FMI - 1 Is Required for Local F - Actin Assembly during the Establishment of Dendrite Self - Avoidance Recent reports show that contact and retraction of PVD 3° dendrites during self - avoidance is associated with local F - actin assembly at dendrite tips ( Liao et al . , 2018 ; Sundararajan et al . , 2019 ) . This spatially and temporally defined F - actin activity is significantly diminished in mutants that display self - avoidance defects , such as mig - 14 / Wntless and wsp - 1 / N - WASP ( Liao et al . , 2018 ) . Cell adhesion molecules and D e v e l o p m e n t • A cc e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t surface receptors engage the actin cytoskeleton to regulate axon branching and synapse formation ( Chen et al . , 2014 ; Chia et al . , 2014 ) . Therefore , we tested whether FMI - 1 promotes dendrite self - avoidance through F - actin assembly . To monitor F - actin activity in live animals , we expressed EGFP - tagged LifeAct , a small peptide that binds F - actin and reports F - actin dynamics ( Riedl et al . , 2008 ) in the PVD neuron , and performed time - lapse spinning - disk confocal microscopy . We identified dendrite contacts by quantifying mCherry fluorescent signals that labeled PVD dendrites , as reported previously ( Figs . 3A and S2 ; see also Materials and Methods ) ( Liao et al . , 2018 ) . Briefly , a 5 - μm region centering at the dendrite contact point was defined as the contact site , and another 5 - μm region along the same 3° dendrite but away from the contact point was selected as the control , non - contact site ( Fig . 3B ) . Using this method , we quantified LifeAct : : EGFP fluorescent signal intensity and confirmed that F - actin activity increased at the contact sites that lasted for the duration of dendrite contact and diminished before dendrite retraction ( Fig . 3C , D , Video S3 ) . No such F - actin activity was observed at the non - contact sites ( Fig . 3C , D ) , suggesting that dendrite self - avoidance is associated with temporally and spatially defined F - actin dynamics . In the fmi - 1 mutant , F - actin assembly at the contact sites during self - avoidance events was markedly decreased , whereas F - actin dynamics at non - contact sites were comparable to those in the control ( Fig . 3A , C and D , Video S4 ) . These observations indicate that FMI - 1 regulates dendrite self - avoidance by promoting F - actin assembly at dendrite tips that coincides with the self - avoidance event . FMI - 1 Promotes F - Actin Dynamics through WSP - 1 / N - WASP To explore how FMI - 1 regulates F - actin dynamics , we next tested wsp - 1 , which encodes the C . elegans homologue of N - WASP known as a critical regulator of D e v e l o p m e n t • A cc e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t F - actin assembly ( Derivery and Gautreau , 2010 ) . We previously showed that wsp - 1 promotes PVD dendrite self - avoidance likely through facilitating local F - actin assembly at dendrite tips ( Liao et al . , 2018 ) . gm324 is a deletion allele that produces no detectable wsp - 1 transcripts or WSP - 1 protein , and is thus a putative null wsp - 1 allele ( Withee et al . , 2004 ) . Defects of self - avoidance were comparable in the fmi - 1 and wsp - 1 single mutants and were not further increased in the wsp - 1 ; fmi - 1 double mutant , suggesting that these two genes act in a common pathway ( Fig . 4A ) . PVD - specific expression of wsp - 1 rescued self - avoidance defects of the wsp - 1 or the fmi - 1 mutant ( Fig . 4A ) , and it did not cause self - avoidance defects in the wild - type background ( control , median = 2 . 9 % ( 2 . 3 - 7 . 9 % ) , n = 11 ; Pser - 2 . 3 : : mCherry : : WSP - 1 , median = 5 . 15 % ( 0 - 9 . 7 % ) , n = 12 , p = 0 . 51 , Mann - Whitney U test ) . By contrast , fmi - 1 overexpression from the fmi - 1 promoter failed to rescue the wsp - 1 mutant . These results indicate that wsp - 1 acts cell - autonomously in PVD and likely downstream of fmi - 1 . We next tested how FMI - 1 interacts with WSP - 1 . Diffuse cytosolic signal of an mCherry : : WSP - 1 transgene expressed in PVD made it difficult to conclude whether mCherry : : WSP - 1 colocalizes with FMI - 1 : : GFP . We were unable to detect WSP - 1 protein distribution in PVD in a strain whose endogenous wsp - 1 gene was tagged with GFP using the CRISPR ( Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ) - Cas9 technique ( Zhu et al . , 2016 ) , possibly due to low expression level . Our model suggests that inhibition of F - actin disassembly may offset the deleterious effects of fmi - 1 or wsp - 1 mutations on F - actin dynamics . The C . elegans gene unc - 60 encodes cofilin , a protein that promotes F - actin disassembly ( Ono and Benian , 1998 ) . An unc - 60 mutation suppressed self - avoidance defects in the fmi - 1 mutant but did not cause dendrite defects in otherwise control background ( Fig . 4B ) . Taken together , our data indicate that FMI - 1 leverages F - actin dynamics to promote dendrite self - avoidance . D e v e l o p m e n t • A cc e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t To further understand whether fmi - 1 regulates dendrite self - avoidance by interacting with known signaling pathways , we made double mutants that contained fmi - 1 ( rh308 ) and either the unc - 40 or mig - 14 mutations . We showed in prior work that mig - 14 and unc - 40 act independently to regulate dendrite self - avoidance in PVD ( Liao et al . , 2018 ) . We found that self - avoidance defects were more severe in the unc - 40 ; fmi - 1 or the mig - 14 ; fmi - 1 double mutants , compared to those of either the unc - 40 , mig - 14 or fmi - 1 single mutants ( Fig . S3A , B ) . These observations suggest that fmi - 1 acts in a genetic pathway distinct from that of mig - 14 or unc - 40 to regulate dendrite self - avoidance . FMI - 1 Antagonizes the Polarity Protein VANG - 1 / Vangl2 to Regulate Dendrite Self - Avoidance Flamingo is a component of a molecular cascade known as the planar cell polarity ( PCP ) that specifies planar tissue polarity in Drosophila and mammals ( Devenport , 2014 ) . VANG - 1 , the C . elegans homologue of the PCP component Vangl2 / Strabismus / Van Gogh , regulates several aspects of neural development , including neuronal migration and neurite branching ( Chen et al . , 2017 ; He et al . , 2018 ; Mentink et al . , 2014 ; Sanchez - Alvarez et al . , 2011 ) . We recently showed that VANG - 1 acts in the Wnt - Frizzled pathway to specify neurite branching sites in the PLM mechanosensory neuron by restricting F - actin dynamics ( Chen et al . , 2017 ) . In the vang - 1 mutant , F - actin assembly increased and was distributed to ectopic sites . This observation raises the intriguing possibility that vang - 1 mutations may suppress dendrite self - avoidance defects of the fmi - 1 mutant by upregulating F - actin assembly . To test this hypothesis , we examined two vang - 1 mutants ( Fig . 5A , B ) . In addition to the commonly used tm1422 deletion allele , we generated a new vang - 1 allele , twn2 , by CRISPR - Cas9 gene editing . twn2 contains a premature stop codon D e v e l o p m e n t • A cc e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t predicted to truncate the majority of the VANG - 1 protein and thus represents a putative null mutation ( Fig . 5A ) . Dendrite self - avoidance in the vang - 1 ( tm1422 ) and vang - 1 ( twn2 ) mutants was indistinguishable from that of the control ( Fig . 5B ) . Interestingly , both vang - 1 mutations significantly suppressed self - avoidance defects of the fmi - 1 mutant ( Fig . 5B ) . Expression of vang - 1 specifically in PVD of the fmi - 1 ; vang - 1 double mutant restored self - avoidance defects to the level observed in the fmi - 1 mutant , indicating that vang - 1 acts cell - autonomously ( Fig . 5C ) . Of note , PVD - specific vang - 1 expression did not cause self - avoidance defects in the wild - type background ( control , median = 2 . 9 % ( 2 . 3 - 7 . 9 % ) , n = 11 ; Pser - 2 . 3 : : mCherry : : VANG - 1 , median = 2 . 65 % ( 0 - 7 . 3 % ) , n = 14 , p = 0 . 23 , Mann - Whitney U test ) . We failed to detect vang - 1 expression in PVD using the transgene syIs202 , which contains 3 kb of the vang - 1 promoter and part of the vang - 1 coding sequence to drive YFP expression ( Green et al . , 2008 ) . However , PVD - specific transcriptional profiling by mRNA - tagging and sequencing had detected vang - 1 expression in PVD ( Smith et al . , 2013 ) . We hypothesize that fmi - 1 antagonizes vang - 1 to ensure efficient dendrite self - avoidance . To test this model , we first investigated the subcellular localization of VANG - 1 by expressing VANG - 1 tagged with GFP or mCherry at the N - terminus in PVD . Punctate GFP : : VANG - 1 or mCherry : : VANG - 1 signals were found in PVD soma and infrequently in dendrites ( Fig . 5D - F ) . We found that some GFP : : VANG - 1 puncta in peripheral PVD dendrites showed colocalization with mCherry - fused COR - 1 / Coronin , an F - actin - binding protein ( Fig . 5E ) , although we were not able to identify VANG - 1 signals at the tips of growing 3° dendrites with confidence . In the fmi - 1 mutant , signal intensity of mCherry : : VANG - 1 in the PVD soma was significantly upregulated ( Fig . 5F , G ) . The frequency of mCherry : : VANG - 1 puncta in peripheral PVD dendrites was also dramatically increased in the fmi - 1 mutant D e v e l o p m e n t • A cc e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t compared to that in the control background ( Fig . 5H , I ) . Overexpression of FMI - 1 did not further decrease mCherry : : VANG - 1 level or frequency , suggesting that VANG - 1 level in PVD was minimal in the control ( Fig . 5F - I ) . Using a transgenic C . elegans strain that expresses FMI - 1 : : GFP and HA : : VANG - 1 broadly in the nervous system ( from the fmi - 1 and rgef - 1 promoter , respectively ) , we showed that FMI - 1 co - immunoprecipitated VANG - 1 ( Figs . 5J and S4 ) . Taking these data together , we conclude that FMI - 1 forms protein complexes with VANG - 1 in C . elegans neurons , and it decreases VANG - 1 level in PVD . FMI - 1 Regulates PVD Axon Extension Both Autonomously and Non - Autonomously In addition to dendrite development , FMI - 1 is important for the extension and guidance of certain axons in the C . elegans ventral nerve cord ( VNC ) that require pioneer axons ( Steimel et al . , 2010 ) . The AVG axon is the first nerve process that establishes the right bundle of the embryonic VNC ( Durbin , 1987 ) . The PVP axons join the embryonic VNC subsequently and serve as pioneers or scaffolds for the following PVQ axons , which enter the embryonic VNC later ( Durbin , 1987 ) ( Wadsworth and Hedgecock , 1996 ; White et al . , 1986 ) . Previous studies show that navigation of follower PVQ axons requires both cell - autonomous and non - autonomous ( from PVP pioneers ) fmi - 1 activities ( Steimel et al . , 2010 ) . Although axons of the HSN motor neurons , which join the VNC at L3 , show navigation and guidance errors in the fmi - 1 mutant , the site of action for fmi - 1 in postembryonic VNC axon navigation remains incompletely understood . The axon of PVD extends and enters the VNC at late L2 to L3 stages , making it a good model to study the autonomous requirement of fmi - 1 in postembryonic axon development . D e v e l o p m e n t • A cc e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t The axons of left and right PVDs fasciculate after entering the right bundle of the VNC ( Fig . 6A , B ) . In the control , PVD axons navigated anteriorly to terminate at or beyond the vulval region ( Fig . 6A , B ) . In the fmi - 1 mutant , PVD axons displayed either premature truncation or posterior misrouting , or both , in more than 90 % of the animals ( Fig . 6A - C ) . Genomic fmi - 1 sequences expressed from the fmi - 1 promoter significantly rescued PVD axon defects when expression in PVD could be confirmed with a cell - specific marker , but not in mosaic transgenic animals that lost fmi - 1 expression from PVD ( Fig . 6C , D ) . These observations indicate that fmi - 1 activity in PVD is necessary to facilitate PVD axon navigation in the VNC , but do not rule out the possibility that non - autonomous fmi - 1 activity is also required . In contrast to its rescue of self - avoidance defects , PVD - specific expression of fmi - 1a failed to rescue axon phenotypes . As the PVD axons fasciculate with other VNC axons , this result suggests that fmi - 1 needs to be present in both PVD and its fasciculating partners for anterior projection , although it may also be possible that other fmi - 1 isoforms are necessary for complete functional complement of fmi - 1 loss . We noted that some fmi - 1 animals still displayed PVD axon defects even with the Pfmi - 1 : : FMI - 1 : : GFP transgene expressed in PVD ( Fig . 6C , D ) . This raises the possibility that fmi - 1 expression outside PVD is also important for PVD axon navigation . PVD axons form chemical synapses with several command interneurons that express the GLR - 1 glutamate receptor , including AVA , AVB and AVD ( Goodman , 2006 ) , which also express fmi - 1 . fmi - 1 may function in one or several of these neurons and signal in a non - autonomous fashion to regulate PVD axon guidance . To test this , we achieved cell - specific fmi - 1 RNAi by expressing fmi - 1 RNA duplex in glr - 1 ( + ) neurons ( Fig . S5A , B ) . Pglr - 1 : : fmi - 1 ( RNAi ) significantly reduced the intensity of FMI - 1 : : GFP in the nerve ring , which contains axons of AVA , AVB and AVD , D e v e l o p m e n t • A cc e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t suggesting that the Pglr - 1 : : fmi - 1 ( RNAi ) transgene effectively decreases fmi - 1 expression in these neurons ( Fig . S5B , C ) . Dimmer signal intensity and susceptibility to photobleaching precluded the use of FMI - 1 : : GFP signals in the VNC for evaluating the efficiency of fmi - 1 RNAi . Silencing fmi - 1 in glr - 1 ( + ) interneurons triggered PVD axon navigation defects in about 20 % of the wild - type animals ( Fig . 6C , E ) , implying that in addition to its major , cell - autonomous function , fmi - 1 can also regulate PVD axon development in a non - autonomous manner . DISCUSSION In this work , we present evidence indicating that the C . elegans Flamingo FMI - 1 promotes dendrite self - avoidance by orchestrating spatially and temporally defined F - actin assembly at the dendrite tips . This intricate regulation of F - actin dynamics by FMI - 1 is likely mediated through two molecules ( Fig . 7A ) . First , FMI - 1 facilitates F - actin assembly by genetically interacting with N - WASP , which is well - known for promoting F - actin polymerization through Arp2 / 3 ( Derivery and Gautreau , 2010 ) . Second , FMI - 1 antagonizes VANG - 1 / Van Gogh , which is recently found to restrict F - actin assembly in C . elegans neurites ( Chen et al . , 2017 ) . These two molecules may act in similar or distinct genetic pathways to ensure precise F - actin assembly at the tips of contacting sister dendrites for efficient retraction . Together with recent work on the effects of MIG - 14 / Wntless and Netrin signaling in PVD dendrite morphogenesis , our work reinforces the notion that F - actin is a central cytoskeletal component for dendrite self - avoidance in C . elegans . Validation in other systems , such as insects and mammals , is important to establish this as a conserved mechanism that sculpts non - overlapping dendrite morphology . D e v e l o p m e n t • A cc e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t FMI - 1 Is Required for Contact - Dependent Dendrite Retraction Cadherins play important roles in different aspects of neural development , such as neurite extension , axon fasciculation and synapse formation ( Takeichi , 2007 ) . The role of Flamingo , an atypical cadherin , in dendrite self - avoidance was first discovered in Drosophila ( Matsubara et al . , 2011 ) . Given its multiple extracellular domains characteristic of an adhesion molecule , such as cadherin repeats and laminin G domains , it was somewhat unexpected that the absence of Flamingo activity resulted in ectopic dendrite contact . Matsubara et al . showed that Flamingo genetically interacts with the LIM - domain protein Espinas through the juxtamembrane domain A ( JM - A ) . LIM domain proteins , such as C . elegans UNC - 115 , regulate cytoskeleton , including actins ( Gitai et al . , 2003 ; Smith et al . , 2014 ) . We performed amino acid sequence analysis of FMI - 1 and Drosophila Flamingo , but we did not find FMI - 1 sequences homologous to the Drosophila Flamingo JM - A ( data not shown ) . Flamingo also interacts with RhoA , a well - established F - actin regulator . These observations are consistent with our findings that F - actin assembly mediates the effects of Flamingo on dendrite self - avoidance . FMI - 1 lacks the conserved WIRS ( WAVE Regulatory Complex Interacting Receptor Sequence ) , a hexapeptide motif in the cytosolic tail of cell membrane receptors that directly bind WRC ( Chen et al . , 2014 ) . We thus suspect that interaction between FMI - 1 and the actin regulatory machinery is indirect . Identification of FMI - 1 - interacting proteins will shed light on the molecular link between Flamingo and N - WASP , WRC , Arp2 / 3 and other actin regulators . Antagonism between Flamingo and Van Gogh in Dendrite Self - Avoidance The core PCP component Van Gogh acts with Flamingo in a number of neurodevelopmental processes ( Tissir and Goffinet , 2013 ) . The antagonism between D e v e l o p m e n t • A cc e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t VANG - 1 / Van Gogh and FMI - 1 during dendrite self - avoidance was thus unexpected and highlighted the complex interaction between different PCP molecules . That FMI - 1 forms protein complexes with VANG - 1 and lowers VANG - 1 level in neurons raises the possibility that retention of VANG - 1 by FMI - 1 in the protein complex facilitates VANG - 1 turnover . Our previous work on neurite branching revealed that VANG - 1 restricts F - actin assembly in the C . elegans PLM mechanosensory neuron ( Chen et al . , 2017 ) . Consistent with this , we find that vang - 1 mutations suppressed self - avoidance defects of the fmi - 1 mutant , likely through restoring F - actin formation in the dendrites . It remains unclear how VANG - 1 inhibits F - actin assembly , although some VANG - 1 proteins appear to colocalize with F - actin in PVD neurons . A recent study in the rat testis finds that Vangl2 , the mammalian Van Gogh , binds actin and modulates F - actin configuration ( Chen et al . , 2016 ) . Loss or overexpression of Vangl2 changed F - actin organization and subcellular distribution in Sertoli cells , with knockdown of Vangl2 enhancing F - actin and N - cadherin levels . Elucidation of the protein structure of Van Gogh , which remains largely unexplored , is necessary to understand how Van Gogh modulates F - actin organization as well as how Flamingo antagonizes Van Gogh . F - Actin Assembly and Dendrite Retraction Prior studies using LifeAct : : EGFP as a reporter for F - actin dynamics suggest that F - actin assembly at dendrite tips increases around the time of contact and retraction of sister dendrites in PVD ( Liao et al . , 2018 ; Sundararajan et al . , 2019 ) . The spatial resolution of time - lapse confocal microscopy does not allow us to distinguish whether F - actin assembly occurs after physical contact of dendritic membrane , or it occurs when sister dendrites are close but still separate . Dendrite extension occurs normally in the fmi - 1 and wsp - 1 mutants , but their retraction is impaired , together with D e v e l o p m e n t • A cc e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t diminished F - actin assembly . These observations imply that F - actin assembly is required for dendrite repulsion , a notion further supported by the observation that unc - 60 / cofilin mutations suppress dendrite self - avoidance defects . How does F - actin assembly drive dendrite retraction ? Semaphorin 3A has been shown to collapse axon growth cone and induce axon retraction in cultured chicken dorsal root ganglion neurons in an F - actin - dependent manner ( Gallo , 2006 ) . Addition of semaphorin 3A diminishes F - actin in the growth cone but increases F - actin assembly in an axonal segment behind the growth cone . Inhibition of RhoA or Rho - dependent kinase ( ROCK ) decreases intra - axonal F - actin and significantly suppresses semaphorin 3A - induced axon retraction . It is thus hypothesized that intra - axonal F - actin drives axon retraction in the presence of repulsive signals , likely through engaging myosin II ( Gallo , 2006 ) . Interestingly , a recent study finds that mutations in the C . elegans gene nmy - 1 , which encodes non - muscle myosin II , resulted in PVD dendrite self - avoidance defects ( Sundararajan et al . , 2019 ) . One possibility is that activation of membrane receptors , such as Flamingo , Wntless or DCC , leads to a redistribution of F - actin assembly towards dendrite tips . Retrograde actin flow driven by myosin II , along with enhanced membrane retrieval , leads to axon retraction ( Gallo , 2006 ; Yang et al . , 2012 ) . Termination of receptor activation following dendrite separation from the initial contact decreases F - actin assembly and stops dendrite repulsion , which may explain the transient nature of dendrite retraction during self - avoidance . F - actin polymerization may also facilitate membrane retrieval at distal dendrites , which contributes to dendrite retraction . We speculate that F - actin dynamics orchestrate concerted cytoskeletal shortening and retrieval of dendrite membrane , resolving sister dendrites in transient contact during self - avoidance . However , spatial and temporal resolution of fluorescent imaging in the current work is not sufficient for documenting fine F - actin features in the dynamic dendritic branches during self - avoidance . D e v e l o p m e n t • A cc e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t Super - resolution microscopy that offers temporal resolution at the time scale of hundred milliseconds and an F - actin reporter with improved signal - to - noise ratio should help to clarify the correlation between F - actin dynamics and distinct steps in dendrite self - avoidance . Autonomous and Non - Autonomous FMI - 1 Functions in Axon Guidance In addition to dendrite self - avoidance , we find that FMI - 1 is also required for navigation of the PVD axon in the VNC . The modest self - avoidance defects in the fmi - 1 mutant suggest that other pathways act in parallel to ensure the robustness of dendrite repulsion . By contrast , most fmi - 1 mutant animals show PVD axon guidance defects , implicating FMI - 1 as an essential factor in PVD axon development . FMI - 1 is required for the development of multiple C . elegans neuronal classes whose axons travel in the VNC , including PVP , PVQ , HSN and glr - 1 ( + ) command interneurons ( Steimel et al . , 2010 ) . The axon phenotypes are complex in the fmi - 1 mutant and seem to depend on the neuronal type . Axons of the left and right PVP travel in the right and left fascicles of the VNC , respectively . Axons of the left and right PVQ use the PVP axons as guidepost and follow them in the VNC . In the absence of fmi - 1 , the pioneer PVPR axon often defasciculates from the left VNC fascicle and crosses to the contralateral right VNC fascicle . As a result , the follower PVQ axons display penetrant crossover defects and join inappropriate VNC fascicles in the fmi - 1 mutant . fmi - 1 expression in the pioneer PVP axons rescues crossover defects in both PVP and the follower PVQ , while fmi - 1 expression in PVQ only rescues defects of the PVQ but not those of the pioneer PVP axons . These observations suggest that fmi - 1 controls PVQ axon development both cell - autonomously and non - autonomously . By contrast , premature truncation of PVQ axons in the fmi - 1 mutant could only be rescued when fmi - 1 is expressed in PVQ , suggesting a cell - autonomous requirement of fmi - 1 in D e v e l o p m e n t • A cc e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t axon extension . Analysis of fmi - 1 mutant animals mosaic for PVD - specific fmi - 1 rescue , using the Pfmi - 1 : : FMI - 1 : : GFP transgene , suggests that fmi - 1 activity in PVD is essential for axon development . However , expression of fmi - 1a in PVD fails to rescue axon defects of the fmi - 1 mutant . Moreover , reducing fmi - 1 activity in glr - 1 ( + ) command interneurons , with which PVD axons make synapses , results in defective PVD axon navigation . These data are consistent with the model that FMI - 1 acts both autonomously and non - autonomously to control PVD axon development . It is also possible that more than one fmi - 1 isoforms are necessary to fully rescue the axon defects . Crossover defects in axons of command interneurons are found in 10 - 20 % of the fmi - 1 mutant animals ( Steimel et al . , 2010 ) , implying that PVD axon defects in some fmi - 1 animals are likely the consequence of disrupted development of interneuron axons . Together with the results of rescue experiments , our data support both cell - autonomous and non - autonomous roles for fmi - 1 in PVD axon development ( Fig . 7B ) . This also raises the possibility of heterophilic FMI - 1 interaction with other membrane - tethered or diffusible ligands . Candidates include molecules with cadherin repeats , EGF or laminin domains . Identification of FMI - 1 ligands will advance our understanding of how Flamingo signaling controls axon extension and navigation to sculpt the connectivity of neuronal circuitries .

Plasmid construction and germline transformation Constructs used in this study are generated by standard molecular biological techniques . Constructs used to generate the twnEx series of transgenes are in the pPD95 . 77 vector , except for Pfmi - 1 : : FMI - 1 : : GFP , which is kindly provided by Harald Hutter , Simon Fraser University , Canada . The fmi - 1a cDNA is a generous gift from Georgia Rapti and Shai Shaham , The Rockefeller University , USA . Germline transformation by microinjection is performed as previously described ( Mello et al . , 1991 ) . D e v e l o p m e n t • A cc e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t CRISPR - Cas9 genome editing CRISPR - Cas9 mutagenesis is performed by germline transformation using pDD162 ( Peft - 3 : : Cas9 , Addgene # 47549 ) inserted with vang - 1 sgRNA : GACACGAGGAGTTGCGTT . An unc - 22 sgRNA construct is co - injected as a co - CRISPR marker to select F1 animals whose genomes are successfully edited at the unc - 22 locus to indicate possible editing at the vang - 1 locus . Editing of vang - 1 is also suggested by performing T7 - endonuclease I digestion of the PCR products of target vang - 1 sequence from F1 ( Mashal et al . , 1995 ; Shen et al . , 2014 ) and is further confirmed by DNA sequencing . Scoring of PVD axon projection defects PVD axon defects are scored with the transgene wdIs52 , which expresses soluble GFP from the regulatory sequence of the C . elegans gene F49H12 . 4 in PVD , AQR , and a cell in the tail ( Smith et al . , 2010 ) . For characterizing PVD axon projection , L4 animals are collected and immobilized by 1 % sodium azide and are manually oriented to turn the ventral side up . PVD axons are imaged under the 40X objective of the Zeiss AxioImager M2 system ( Carl Zeiss ) . Axons that project anteriorly beyond the vulva are defined as normal . Axons that project both anteriorly and posteriorly are defined as axon bifurcation . Axons that project anteriorly but fail to reach the midpoint between vulva and the PVD soma are classified as premature truncation . Axons that project posteriorly are classified as posterior misrouting . Unbundling of the left and right PVD axons is defined as defasciculation . D e v e l o p m e n t • A cc e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t Quantification of dendrite self - avoidance defects Quantification of PVD dendrite self - avoidance was described previously ( Liao et al . , 2018 ; Smith et al . , 2010 ) . Briefly , the number of estimated gaps ( G ) in the entire PVD dendritic arbor is defined as G = ( K - 1 ) + ( N - 1 ) where K and N are the numbers of dorsal and ventral secondary branches , respectively . The percentage of PVD dendrite self - avoidance defect is defined as : Self - avoidance defect ( % ) = M ( missing gaps ) / G x 100 % Time - lapse imaging For time - lapse imaging of dendrite self - avoidance , laid embryos are cultivated at 20 ° C for around 30 hours to obtain L3 larvae . Animals are immobilized in 2 μ l of 1 mM levamisole with 2 μ l of polystyrene beads ( 0 . 1 μ m , Polysciences ) on 10 % agar pad . Images are taken under the 40X objective of the Carl Zeiss Cell Observer SD ( Carl Zeiss ) equipped with Yokogawa CSU - X1 spinning disk and EMCCD Qimaging Rolera EM - C2 at 2 frame / minute for at least 30 minutes per animal . For F - actin imaging during dendrite contact , L3 larvae expressing LifeAct : : EGFP are collected and immobilized in 1mM levamisole and polystyrene beads described earlier on 10 % agar pad . The imaging apparatus and condition are the same as those for time - lapse imaging of dendrite self - avoidance . Fluorescence confocal microscopy For analyzing dendrite self - avoidance defects and protein localization , L4 hermaphrodites are anesthetized in 1 % sodium azide and mounted on 5 % agar pad . To assess fmi - 1 RNAi knockdown efficiency , FMI : : GFP intensity in the nerve ring of L2 D e v e l o p m e n t • A cc e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t hermaphrodites are quantified . C . elegans protein expression pattern and neuronal morphology are imaged under Zeiss LSM700 or LSM880 Airyscan Imaging system ( Carl Zeiss ) . Quantification of fluorescent signal intensity To evaluate fmi - 1 RNAi knockdown efficiency , z - stack projection images of the nerve ring are acquired by Zeiss LSM700 Confocal Imaging System ( Carl Zeiss ) and FMI - 1 : : GFP signals are quantified by ImageJ . For analyzing LifeAct : : EGFP signals in PVD dendrites , two 5 μ m regions ( contact site and non - contact site ) are selected and quantified by using Zen system ( Zen 2011 blue edition ) . For analyzing mCherry : : VANG - 1 signals in PVD soma , single optical sections of a z - stack series taken by Zeiss LSM700 Confocal Imaging System ( Carl Zeiss ) are quantified by ImageJ and then summed to derive mean signal intensity , which is total mCherry pixel intensity divided by the total area of PVD soma . To quantify mCherry : : VANG - 1 puncta in PVD dendrites , z - stack projection images are obtained by Zeiss LSM700 Confocal Imaging System ( Carl Zeiss ) . Each single mCherry : : VANG - 1 punctum in PVD dendrites was first quantified by Zen system ( Zen 2010 black edition ) . We define discrete mCherry : : VANG - 1 punctum with area larger than 1 μ m 2 and intensity higher than 10 a . u . as a valid mCherry : : VANG - 1 punctum . Worm immunoprecipitation and western blotting The constructs Pfmi - 1 : : FMI - 1 : : GFP and Prgef - 1 : : HA : : VANG - 1 , together with a rescue construct PCG150 ( Punc - 119 : : UNC - 119 rescue fragment ) , are co - injected into unc - 119 ( ed3 ) . The resulting transgenic strain expresses both FMI - 1 : : GFP and VANG - 1 : : HA expression throughout the nervous system . The Bristol N2 and strains with only twnEx458 [ Pfmi - 1 : : FMI - 1 : : GFP ( 30 ng / ul ) , Pgcy - 8 : : mCherry ] or D e v e l o p m e n t • A cc e p t e d m a n u s c r i p t twnEx572 [ Prgef - 1 : : HA : : VANG - 1 ] serve as controls . Animals are cultivated on 10 - cm NGM plates spread with OP50 E . coli at 20 ° C for 4 - 5 days until 80 % confluence is reached . Animals from 20 such plates are collected by washing with M9 buffer for 5 times , followed by wash with 1x PBS and lysis buffer ( 25mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 100mM NaCl , 1mM EDTA ) and buffer for worm lysis containing 25mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 100mM NaCl , 1mM EDTA , 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 10 mM NaF and protease inhibitor cocktail ( 04693132001 , Roche ) . A worm pellet of roughly 0 . 25 ml is then transferred to a screw cap tube ( Dot Scientific ) with 0 . 5 ml of 1 . 0 mm Zirconia beads ( BioSpec ) and 1 ml of lysis buffer / protease inhibitor cocktails . Tubes are then placed on a FastPrep - 24 TM 5G Benchtop Homogenizer ( MP Biomedicals ) and homogenized with 3 pulses of 30 seconds at maximal speed . Proteins are collected by spinning the lysates at 13 , 000 rpm for 30 minutes to remove the insoluble material . A total of 10 mg protein with 30 μl of GFP nanobody ( GFP - Trep  , Chromotek , Germany ) or 30 μl of monoclonal anti - HA - agarose ( A2095 , Sigma - Aldrich ) are used to perform the immunoprecipitation experiments . We use the following primary antibodies : rabbit polyclonal anti - HA , 1 : 1000 ( ab71113 , Abcam ) , rabbit polyclonal anti - GFP , 1 : 1000 ( sc - 8334 , Santa Cruz ) and anti - beta actin ( 1 : 2000 , sc - 47778 , Santa Cruz ) . The secondary antibodies used in this study are peroxidase - conjugated AffiniPure goat anti - rabbit IgG , 1 : 5000 ( 111 - 035 - 003 , Jackson ImmunoResearch ) and HRP goat anti - mouse IgG , 1 : 5000 ( 405306 , BioLegend ) .
