RESEARCH ARTICLE SUMMARY ◥ SCIENCE COMMUNITY Quantifying the evolution of individual scientific impact Roberta Sinatra , Dashun Wang , Pierre Deville , Chaoming Song , Albert - László Barabási * INTRODUCTION : In most areas of human performance , from sport to engineering , the path to a major accomplishment requires a steep learning curve and long practice . Science is not that different : Outstanding discoveries are often preceded by publications of less mem - orable impact . However , despite the increas - ing desire to identify early promising scientists , the temporal career patterns that character - ize the emergence of scientific excellence remain unknown . RATIONALE : How do impact and productiv - ity change over a scientific career ? Does im - pact , arguably the most relevant performance measure , follow predictable patterns ? Can we predict the timing of a scientist ’ s out - standing achievement ? Can we model , in quantitative and predictive terms , scientific careers ? Driven by these questions , here we quantify the evolution of impact and pro - ductivity throughout thousands of scientific careers . We do so by reconstructing the publi - cation record of scientists from seven disci - plines , associating to each paper its long - term impact on the scientific community , as quan - tified by citation metrics . RESULTS : We find that the highest - impact work in a scientist ’ s career is randomly dis - tributed within her body of work . That is , the highest - impact work can be , with the same probability , anywhere in the sequence of papers published by a scientist — it could be the first publication , could appear mid - career , or could be a scientist ’ s last publica - tion . This random - impact rule holds for scientists in different disciplines , with different career lengths , working in different dec - ades , and publishing solo or with teams and whether credit is assigned uniformly or unevenly among collaborators . The random - impact rule allows us to dev - elop a quantitative model , which systematically untangles the role of productivity and luck in each scientific career . The model assumes that each scientist selects a project with a random potential p and improves on it with a factor Q i , resulting in a publication of im - pact Q i p . The parameter Q i captures the ability of scientist i to take advantage of the available knowledge in a way that enhances ( Q i > 1 ) or diminishes ( Q i < 1 ) the potential impact p of a paper . The model predicts that truly high - impact discoveries require a combi - nation of high Q and luck ( p ) and that increased productivity alone cannot substantially enhance the chance of a very high impact work . We also show that a scientist ’ s Q , capturing her sustained ability to publish high - impact papers , is independent of her career stage . This is in contrast with all current metrics of excellence , from the total number of citations to the h - index , which increase with time . The Q model provides an analytical expression of these tra - ditional impact metrics and allows us to predict their future time evolution for each individual scientist , being also predictive of independent recognitions , like Nobel prizes . CONCLUSION : The random - impact rule and the Q parameter , representing two fun - damental characteristics of a scientific career , offer a rigorous quantitative framework to ex - plore the evolution of individual careers and understand the emergence of scientific excel - lence . Such understanding could help us better gauge scientific performance and offers a path toward nurturing high - impact scientists , po - tentially informing future policy decisions . ▪ RESEARCH 596 4 NOVEMBER 2016 (cid:127) VOL 354 ISSUE 6312 sciencemag . org SCIENCE Random - impact rule .

Here , we quantify the changes in impact and productivity throughout a career in science , finding that impact , as measured by influential publications , is distributed randomly within a scientist ’ s sequence of publications . This random - impact rule allows us to formulate a stochastic model that uncouples the effects of productivity , individual ability , and luck and unveils the existence of universal patterns governing the emergence of scientific success . The model assigns a unique individual parameter Q to each scientist , which is stable during a career , and it accurately predicts the evolution of a scientist ’ s impact , from the h - index to cumulative citations , and independent recognitions , such as prizes . P roductivity , representing the number of publications authored by a scientist over time , and impact , often approximated by the number of citations a publication re - ceives ( 1 – 4 ) , are frequently used metrics to gauge a scientist ’ s performance . Despite their widespread use , we lack a quantitative understand - ing of the patterns these metrics follow during a scientist ’ s career ( 5 ) . This is particularly alarm - ing ( 6 – 11 ) , given that they are increasingly adopted for academic assessment ( 4 , 11 ) and serve as the input for numerous indicators , like the h - index and its variants , which are frequently used to compare individual performance ( 12 – 14 ) . Given the increasing interest in predicting the value of these indicators ( 5 , 15 ) , here we ask : How do impact and productivity change over a typical scientific career ? Does impact , arguably the most relevant performance measure , follow predictable patterns ? Can we predict the timing of a scientist ’ s outstanding achievement ? Can we untangle the role of impact , productivity , and luck within a scientific career ? To address these questions , we reconstruct the publication profile of scientists from multiple disciplines and associate each of their publica - tions with an impact , as captured by c 10 , the number of citations 10 years after publication ( Fig . 1A ; see Methods and section S1 ) . Motivated partly by the exceptional aware - ness of a scientist ’ s highest - impact work ( 16 , 17 ) , like radioactivity for Marie Curie and the double helix for Watson and Crick , we identified for each researcher her most - cited paper , c 10 * , that is , the paper with the highest number of citations 10 years after its publication . The distribution P ð c 10 * Þ for the studied scientists indicates that only 5 % have c 10 * ≥ 200 ; hence , most scientific careers have limited maximal impact . To system - atically distinguish the careers on the basis of their peak impact , we group each scientist in - to high maximum impact ( top 5 % , c 10 * ≥ 200 ) , low maximum impact ( bottom 20 % , c 10 * ≤ 20 ) , and medium maximum impact ( middle 75 % , 20 < c 10 * < 200 ) categories ( Fig . 1B and section S2 ) . Productivity and impact patterns in scientific careers The total number of papers scientist i publishes up to time t after her first publication , N i ( t ) , asymptotically follows N i ð t Þ ∼ t g i ( Fig . 1C ) ( 18 ) . Hence , yearly productivity , n i ( t ) , follows the same scaling with exponent ( g i − 1 ) ( fig . S5 ) . Yet , the scaling exponent is different for low - , medium - , and high - impact scientists ( Fig . 1C ) . We find that for low - impact scientists , h g i = 1 . 55 , indicating on average a steady increase in their productivity . The increase is much faster for high - impact researchers , for whom h g i = 2 . 05 ( Fig . 1D ) . These trends are also con - firmed by changes in the yearly productivity h n ( t ) i : For high - impact scientists , productivity increases almost threefold during their career , whereas the increase is modest for low - impact scientists ( Fig . 1E ) . Together , Fig . 1 ( D and E ) indicates that productivity changes through - out a scientific career . We find , however , that this trend is modulated by impact : Productivity growth is more pronounced for high - impact sci - entists and is modest for low - impact scientists ( Fig . 1 , C to E ) . As Fig . 2A indicates , impact appears to follow similar patterns to productivity ( Fig . 1E ) : Although c 10 increases during a high - impact scientist ’ s career , an increase is hardly noticeable for av - erage and low - impact individuals . Yet , we ob - serve a markedly different pattern if we examine the impact in the vicinity of t * , the publication time of the most - cited work c 10 * . Plotting h c 10 i for the sequence of papers before and after an in - dividual ’ s most - cited paper , c 10 * ( Fig . 2B ) , we do not see a gradual increase in impact as a sci - entist approaches t * , nor do we observe elevated citations after this breakthrough . Instead , the observed pattern exhibits a singular behavior . This singularity could be a simple result of averaging random - impact fluctuations present in careers . We find , however , that the result is robust if we use a moving average or consider only the publication with maximum impact in a rolling window ( section S2 . 1 and fig . S6 ) and is validated using the fitting hypothesis c i 10 ð t Þ ∼ a i t , lacking differences in a i before or after t * ( section S2 . 2 and fig . S7 ) ( 19 ) . Also , the papers published before and after t * show no discernible differences in their average number of citations ( Fig . 2C ) . Finally , we randomize each career by leaving all productivity measures [ total number of papers , N i , and n i ( t ) ] unchanged but shuffling the impact of each paper within each career ( Fig . 2C ) . The lack of differences between the original and the randomized careers supports our overall con - clusion : There are no detectable changes in im - pact leading up to or following a scientist ’ s highest - impact work . We tested the robustness of this measure for different samples of scientists ( figs . S8 and S9 ) , for different definitions of im - pact ( section S1 . 6 and fig . S10 ) , and in data sets where we attribute different impact shares to each author of a paper ( section S6 and fig . S11 ) , arriving at the same conclusion . Yet , we can - not exclude that there are other choices of im - pact variables or data - set selection that can detect patterns before or after the highest - impact paper . To understand when a scientist publishes her most important work , we measured the proba - bility P ( t * ) that the highest - impact paper is pub - lished at time t * after a scientist ’ s first publication ( Fig . 2D ) . The high P ( t * ) between 0 and 20 years indicates that most scientists publish their highest - impact paper early or midcareer . The drop in P ( t * ) after 20 years suggests that it is unlikely that a scientist ’ s most - cited work will come late in her career , a result well documented by the literature about creativity ( see section S3 . 1 ) ( 20 , 21 ) . To understand the origin of this pattern , we shuffled c 10 among all papers published by the same scientist , preserving the scientist ’ s time - dependent productivity and paper - by - paper im - pact and randomizing only the order of her publications . The fact that P ( t * ) for these synthetic careers is indistinguishable from the original data ( Fig . 2D ) indicates that variations in P ( t * ) are not due to specific impact sequences or other features RESEARCH SCIENCE sciencemag . org 4 NOVEMBER 2016 (cid:127) VOL 354 ISSUE 6312 aaf5239 - 1 1 Center for Complex Network Research and Physics Department , Northeastern University , Boston , MA 02115 , USA . 2 Center for Network Science and Math Department , Central European University , Budapest , Hungary . 3 Kellogg School of Management , Northwestern University , Evanston , IL 60208 , USA . 4 Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems , Northwestern University , Evanston , IL 60208 , USA . 5 Department of Applied Mathematics , Université catholique de Louvain , Louvain - la - Neuve , Belgium . 6 Department of Physics , University of Miami , Coral Gables , FL 33124 , USA . 7 Department of Medicine , Brigham and Women ’ s Hospital , Harvard Medical School , Boston , MA 02115 , USA . 8 Center for Network Science , Central European University , Budapest , Hungary . 9 Center for Cancer Systems Biology , Dana - Farber Cancer Institute , Boston , MA 02115 , USA . * Corresponding author .

S12 ) ( 20 , 21 ) . These results prompted us to explore the po - sition N * of the highest - impact paper in the sequence of N publications of a scientist by measuring P ( N * / N ) , that is , the probability that the most - cited work is early ( N * / N small ) or late ( N * / N ≃ 1 ) within the sequence of papers pub - lished by a scientist . We find that P ( N * / N ) is flat ( Fig . 2E , inset ) , a finding supported by the cu - mulative P ( ≥ N * / N ) ( Fig . 2E ) , which decreases independently of impact as ( N * / N ) − 1 , in line with a uniform P ( N * / N ) . Together , we arrive at a rather unexpected conclusion , representing our main empirical finding : Impact is randomly distributed within a scientist ’ s body of work , regardless of publication time or order in the sequence of publications . We call this the random - impact rule because it indicates that the highest - impact work can be , with the same probability , anywhere in the sequence of N papers published by a scientist . We find that the random - impact rule holds for scientists in different dis - ciplines , with different career lengths , working in different decades , and publishing solo or with teams and whether credit is assigned uniformly or unevenly among collaborators ( sections S1 . 4 and S6 . 1 ) ( 22 ) . The random - impact rule can explain the grow - ing impact during a scientist ’ s career ( Fig . 2A ) . To see this , we again randomly shuffle the im - pact of the papers within each career , leaving the individual productivity unchanged . The variations of impact of the randomized careers are indis - tinguishable from the original data for both high - and low - impact individuals ( Fig . 2A ) . Hence , the growing average impact documented in Fig . 2A is the result of combining the increasing average productivity ( Fig . 1E ) with the heavy - tailed nature of the citation distribution ( 6 , 23 – 25 ) . h c 10 i is not stable but increases with the number of publica - tions , resulting in the observed growing impact ( Fig . 2A ) . Hence , growing productivity , rather than increasing ability or excellence , can account for the growth in average impact during a career in science . The defining role of productivity in the timing of the highest - impact work persists if we extend the analysis to different samples of scientists , not only those with at least 20 years of pub - lication record . We considered different selec - tions of scientists , such as ( i ) grouping them by different career lengths ( figs . S13 and S14 ) , ( ii ) grouping them by decade of active career ( figs . S15 and S16 ) , ( iii ) removing multi - authored papers ( fig . S17 ) , ( iv ) including only papers published in one subarea of physics ( fig . S38 ) , ( v ) creating no filter and including all scientists ( figs . S18 and S19 ) , ( vi ) using different definitions of impact ( figs . S20 , S21 , and S37 ) , or ( vii ) considering the six different disciplines in data set ( ii ) ( figs . S22 and S23 ) . In all these cases , the location of the peak of the highest - impact work probability changes , but we never observe a difference with the random - ized careers . Hence , the specific shape of P ( t * ) is only a function of the selection of scientists and of their temporal productivity patterns , whereas impact is always randomly distributed within a scientist ’ s sequence of publications . The documented random - impact rule raises an important question : What is the role of a researcher ’ s own ability , if any , in scientific ex - cellence ? We propose two quantitative models to answer this question . Random - impact model ( R - model ) We can rely on the random impact rule to build a null model of scientific careers : We assume that each scientist publishes a sequence of pa - pers whose impact is randomly chosen from the same impact distribution P ( c 10 ) . Consequently , the only difference between two scientists is their overall productivity N . With the observed P ( c 10 ) and P ( N ) distributions ( Fig . 3 , A and B ) as input , the obtained R - model ( section S4 . 2 ) accurately reproduces the randomness of the impact se - quence P ( N * / N ) ( Fig . 2E ) , but it also makes two predictions that are at odds with the data . ( a ) Productivity alone begets success : If each paper ’ s impact is randomly drawn from the same P ( c 10 ) , a productive scientist ( high N ) will more likely score a high c 10 * ( see eqs . S7 and S18 ) ( 26 , 27 ) . However , the R - model does not correctly reproduce the observed increase of h c 10 * i as a function of N ( Fig . 3C ) . ( b ) Divergent impact : The higher the aver - age impact of a scientist ’ s publications with - out the most - cited publication h c 10 − * i ( Fig . 1A ) , the higher the impact of the most - cited paper , c 10 * ( Fig . 3D ) . Hence , papers with truly high impact aaf5239 - 2 4 NOVEMBER 2016 (cid:127) VOL 354 ISSUE 6312 sciencemag . org SCIENCE Fig . 1 . Patterns of productivity during a scientific career .

The R - model cannot account for this behavior , predicting that h c 10 * i diverges when h log ð c 10 − * Þi → 1 : 97 ( Fig . 3D ) , a consequence of the log - normal nature of P ( c 10 ) ( section S4 . 1 and fig . S27 ) . Failures ( a ) and ( b ) prompt us to abandon our hypothesis that research papers are all drawn from the same impact distribution and hence researchers have no distinguishable individual impact , forcing us to explore more closely the rela - tionshipbetweenproductivity , impact , andchance . Q - model Crucially , in the R - model , scientists with similar productivity have indistinguishable impact . In reality , impact varies greatly between scientists ( Fig . 3E ) , suggesting the existence of a hidden parameter Q i that modulates impact , which has a unique value for each scientist i . The log - normal nature of P ( c 10 ) ( Fig . 3A ) ( 24 ) indicates the presence of multiplicative processes , prompting us to write the impact c 10 , i a of paper a published by scientist i as c 10 ; i a ¼ Q i p a ð 1 Þ where p a is the potential impact of paper a in the sequence of papers published by scientist i . The parameter Q i captures the ability of scientist i to take advantage of the available knowledge in a way that enhances ( Q i > 1 ) or diminishes ( Q i < 1 ) the potential impact of paper a . We take the value of this parameter Q i to be constant throughout a scientist ’ s career , a hypothesis we validate later ( Fig . 5 and section S4 . 9 ) . The obtained model as - sumes that each scientist randomly selects a project with potential p a and improves on it with a factor Q i that is unique to the scientist , resulting in a paper of impact ( Eq . 1 ) . Truly high - impact publications are therefore the result of a high Q i scientist selecting by chance a high p a project ; any scientist , independently of her parameter Q i , can publish low - impact papers by selecting a low p a . The stochastic process behind the model ( Eq . 1 ) is determined by the joint probability P ( p , Q , N ) , with unknown correlations between p , Q , and N . The log - normal nature of P ( c 10 ) ( Fig . 3A ) allows us to measure P ( p ) , finding that it can also be fitted with a log - normal function ( Fig . 3F ) . Assuming that Q is also a log - normal ( confirmed later ) , we denote with p ^ ¼ log p ; Q ^ ¼ log Q ; N ^ ¼ log N , obtaining the trivariate normal distribution P ð p ^ ; Q ^ ; N ^ Þ ¼ N ( m , S ) . Using a maximum - likelihood approach ( see section S4 . 4 ) , we estimate from the data the mean m ≡ ( m p , m Q , m N ) = ( 0 . 92 , 0 . 93 , 3 . 34 ) and the covariance matrix X ≡ s 2 p s p ; Q s p ; N s p ; Q s 2 Q s Q ; N s p ; N s Q ; N s 2 N 0 @ 1 A ¼ 0 : 93 0 : 00 0 : 00 0 : 000 : 21 0 : 09 0 : 00 0 : 09 0 : 33 0 @ 1 A ð 2 Þ The matrix ( Eq . 2 ) leads to two key predictions : ( i ) s p , N = s p , Q ≃ 0 indicates that the paper potential impact p a is independent of a scientist ’ s productivity N i and her hidden parameter Q i . Therefore , scientists select the potential impact of each paper randomly from a P ( p ) distribution that is the same for all individuals , being inde - pendent of Q and N , capturing a universal — that is , scientist - independent — luck component behind impact . ( ii ) The nonzero s Q , N indicates that the hidden parameter Q and productivity N do depend on each other ( section S4 . 4 ) , but its small value also shows that high Q is only slightly associated with higher productivity . The lack of correlations between p and ( Q , N ) allows us to analytically calculate the dependence of the highest - impact paper h log c 10 * i on productivity SCIENCE sciencemag . org 4 NOVEMBER 2016 (cid:127) VOL 354 ISSUE 6312 aaf5239 - 3 Fig . 2 .

( B ) Average impact h c 10 i of papers published before and after the highest - impact paper c 10 (cid:1) of high - , middle - , and low - impact scientists .

( C ) h c 10 (cid:1) i and h c 10 i before and after a scientist ’ s most - cited paper . For each group , we calculate the average impact of the most - cited paper , h c 10 (cid:1)i , as well as the average impact of all papers before and after the most - cited paper . We also report the same measures obtained in publication sequences for which the impact c 10 (cid:1) is fixed , whereas the impact of all other papers is randomly permuted . ( D ) Distribution of the publication time t * of the highest - impact paper for scientists ’ careers ( black circles ) and for randomized - impact careers ( gray circles ) . The lack of differences between the two curves ( P = 0 . 70 for the Mann - Whitney U test between the two distributions ) supports the random - impact rule ; that is , impact is random within a scientist ’ s sequence of pub - lication . Note that the drop after 20 years is partly because we focus on careers that span at least 20 years ( see fig . S22 ) . ( E ) Cumulative distribution P ( ≥ N * / N ) for scientists with N ≃ 50 , where N * / N denotes the order N of the highest - impact paper in a scientist ’ s career , varying between 1 / N and 1 . The cumulative distribution of N * / N is a straight line with slope 1 , indicating that N has the same probability to occur anywhere in the sequence of papers published by a scientist . The flatness of P ( N * / N ) ( all scientists , inset ) sup - ports the conclusion that the timing of the highest - impact paper is uniform . The small differences between the three curves are due to different number of publications N in the three groups of scientists [ see fig . S24 for the plot of P ( ≥ N * / N ) for other values of N and figs . S25 and S26 for the impact autocorrelation throughout a scientific career ] .

The model prediction for h log c 10 * ið N Þ and h log c 10 * iðh c 10 − * iÞ is in excellent agreement with the data ( Fig . 3 , C and D , and fig . S30 ) , indicating that the hidden parameter Q and variations in the productivity N can ex - plain the empirically observed impact differences between scientists , correcting the shortcomings of the R - model . In summary , the Q - model allows us to generate synthetic sequences of publications , by assigning to each scientist an individual parameter Q and a productivity N , extracted from the distribution P ( Q , N ) . Each paper in the sequence is assigned an impact calculated as p × Q , where p is ran - domly drawn from the distribution P ( p ) , identi - cal for all scientists . The measurement and accuracy of the hidden parameter Q The model allows us to calculate the parameter Q i from the sequence of publications c 10 , i a of each scientist ( section S4 . 5 ) , obtaining for large N i ( see eq . S28 for finite N i and fig . S28 for the relation between the two estimations of the Q parameter ) Q i ¼ e h log c 10 ; i i − m p ð 3 Þ Given its dependence on log c 10 , i a , Q is not dominated by a single high - impact ( or low - impact ) discovery but captures instead a sci - entist ’ s sustained ability to systematically turn her projects into high - impact ( or low - impact ) publications . For example , although the three scientists in Fig . 3E have the same productivity N ≃ 100 , Eq . 3 predicts widely different Q values for them , namely , Q = 9 . 99 , 3 . 31 , and 1 . 49 . These values accurately reflect persistent differences in their sequence of publications : The Q = 9 . 99 researcher consistently publishes high - impact papers , whereas the publications of the Q = 1 . 49 researcher are consistently of limited impact . Hence , the parameter Q captures a scientist ’ s differentiating ability to take random projects p and systematically turn them into high - impact ( or low - impact ) publications . The Q - model makes the unexpected predic - tion that despite the obvious differences in in - dividual career paths , differences in the impact of individual papers should disappear if we use the reduced variable p a = c 10 , i a / Q i , a rescaling standard in statistical physics ( 28 , 29 ) . Although the individual P ( c 10 , i a ) distributions differ greatly , the P ( c 10 , i a / Q i ) distributions for all scientists collapse into a single universal curve P ( p ) ( Fig . 4B ) , confirm - ing the universal nature of impact across all careers ( 30 ) . Finally , the log - normal P ( Q ) ( Fig . 3G ) confirms the model ’ s mathematical self - consistency . A fundamental limitation of all metrics used in science is their nonstationarity : Productivity , the cumulative number of citations , and the h - index all grow in time , making it difficult to compare individuals at different stages of their career . In contrast , we find that the Q parameter is independent of the career stage . To show this , we used a D N = 30 paper window to measure changes in Q during the career of a scientist , observing that the Q parameter fluc - tuates narrowly throughout each career , without systematic changes ( Fig . 5A ) . The magnitude of these fluctuations is explained for 75 % of scientists by the stochastic nature of Q ( section S4 . 9 ) , because the estimated Q parameter lies within the uncertainty envelope provided by the model . In the remaining 25 % of the cases , the variation in Q is slightly higher than the vari - ation predicted by the stochastic nature of the model ( Fig . 5B ) . However , the magnitude of this surplus variation never exceeds 15 % , and the aver - age relative error is always below 10 % ( section S4 . 9 and figs . S31 and S32 ) . Finally , to test the stability of the Q param - eter throughout the overall career , and not as a function of productivity , N , we consider careers with at least 50 papers and calculate their early and late Q parameters ( Q early and Q late , respec - tively ) using Eq . 3 on the first and second half of their papers , respectively . In this case , the sto - chastic uncertainty explains the differences be - tween Q early and Q late for the large majority of scientists ( 95 . 1 % , Fig . 5C ) . Together , these mea - surements indicate that the Q parameter is generally stable throughout a career , allowing aaf5239 - 4 4 NOVEMBER 2016 (cid:127) VOL 354 ISSUE 6312 sciencemag . org SCIENCE Fig . 3 .

The predictive power of the hidden parameter Q The true value of the Q parameter comes in its predictive power : ( i ) The Q parameter allows us to estimate the number of papers a scientist needs to write so that her highest - impact paper gathers c 10 * cita - tions ( Fig . 6B ) . We find that scientists with low Q ( ≃ 1 . 2 ) must write at least 100 papers so that one of them gathers on average 30 citations . Yet , a scientist with the same productivity but Q = 10 is expected to author a c 10 * = 250 paper . Doubling productivity will enhance only with seven citations the highest - impact paper of the low - Q scientist ( Q = 1 . 2 ) , whereas it will boost with more than 50 citations c 10 * for the high - Q scientist . Overall , Fig . 6B documents that for low - Q scientists , increased productivity cannot boost substantially the chance of publishing a high - impact work ; hence , it is very unlikely that they “ get lucky . ” ( ii ) A scientist ’ s h - index , indicating that her h most - cited papers gather at least h citations ( 12 , 15 ) , is jointly determined by the Q param - eter and the productivity N ( section S4 . 11 ) . This analytical prediction reproduces not only the observed h - index of all scientists ( fig . S33B ) but also the evolution of the h - index during a sci - entist ’ s career ( Fig . 6 , C and D , and fig . S34A ) . Similar equations describe the cumulative num - ber of citations ( Fig . 6D and figs . S33 , D to F , and S34B ) and the g - index ( section S4 . 11 ) , indi - cating that the traditional performance measures are uniquely determined by Q . Given that Q is constant in time , we conclude that productivity only can account for career - wide changes in these measures ( Fig . 6 , C and D ) . ( iii ) By determining the value of Q during the early stages of a scientific career , we can use it to predict future career impact . The estimation error D Q of Q decreases with the number of pub - lished papers N and drops below 10 % already after N = 20 publications ( section S4 . 12 ) . We can therefore estimate Q based on a scientist ’ s first N 0 published papers in Eq . 3 and then use the analytical expression of the h - index and of the total number of citations to predict the future impact of a scientist ( section S4 . 12 and fig . S35 ) . Given the stochastic nature of the Q - model , an uncertainty envelope accompanies the most likely value of each impact metric . In Fig . 6E , for two scientists , we show the h - index prediction up to N = 150 after we estimated Q from the first N 0 = 20 ( top ) and N 0 = 50 ( bottom ) papers . Although the initial h - index overlaps for the two scientists , their long - term impact diverges , a difference ac - curately predicted by the Q - model . Generalizing for a larger sample of scientists , we find a strong correlation between the predicted and observed h - index ( Fig . 6F ) . To quantify the Q model ’ s over - all predictive accuracy , we measured the fraction of times that the h - index falls within the envelope for scientists with at least 100 papers .

We find that 71 % of scientists have z 40 ≤ 2 based on N 0 = 20 , which improves to 81 % for N 0 = 50 and z 70 ( Fig . 6G ) . Together , we conclude that the es - timation of the Q parameter at early stages has the capability to unveil the long - term career impact . ( iv ) To test whether Q i correlates with out - standing impact , we ranked scientists on the basis of Q , N , C tot , c 10 * , and their h - index . To val - idate these rankings , we use a receiver operat - ing characteristic ( ROC ) plot that measures the fraction of Nobel laureates at the top of the ranked list ( Fig . 6A ) . We find that the Q - based ranking predicts Nobel - winning careers most accurately , offering the highest area of all rank - ing measures ( Fig . 6A ) and the highest precision and recall ( section S7 and fig . S45 ) . Equally no - table is the finding that the predictive powers of C tot , c 10 * , and the h - index are indistinguishable from each other and that the productivity N is the least predictive . Similar results are obtained if we use Q i to detect Dirac and Boltzmann medalists ( figs . S46 and S47 ) . The early - career Q has also the best accuracy in predicting Nobel laureates ( section S7 . 1 and fig . S48 ) . High - impact discoveries often result from col - laborative work ( 31 – 33 ) , mixing scientists with different Q i . To explore the influence of collab - orators ( 34 , 35 ) , we used a credit allocation al - gorithm ( 22 , 36 ) to attribute different impact shares to each author . We then repeated our entire analysis , finding that the Q - model , with slightly revised parameters , can explain the re - sults ( section S6 . 1 and figs . S40 to S43 ) . Further , we find that Q i is robust to the omission of in - dividual collaborators ( section S6 . 2 and fig . S44 ) . Hence , although collaborative and team effects modulate the success of a particular publication , individual collaborators have only limited influ - ence on Q i . Summary and discussion In summary , we offer empirical evidence that impact is randomly distributed within the se - quence of papers published by a scientist , im - plying that temporal changes in impact during a scientific career can be explained by temporal changes in productivity , luck , and the heavy - tailed nature of a scientist ’ s individual impact distribution . This finding allowed us to system - atically untangle the role of productivity , luck , and a scientist ’ s Q , predicting that truly high - impact papers require a combination of high Q and luck ( high p ) and that high productivity alone has only a limited effect on the like - lihood of high - impact work in a scientific career , if it is not associated with high Q . The mea - surable Q parameter represents a scientist ’ s sustained ability to publish high - impact ( or low - impact ) papers . Virtually , all currently used metrics of per - formance change during the career of a scien - tist , capturing progression , not sustained ability . In contrast , Q is constant throughout a scientist ’ s career for most scientists ( 76 % ) , and it is not dom - inated by a single paper or collaborator , being a measure intrinsically linked to an individual . The fundamental nature of the Q parameter is supported by the fact that the currently used metrics of success , from the h - index to cumulative citations , can be calculated from it . Q predicts not only the value but also the time evolution of the traditional impact metrics ( Fig . 6 , C to F ) . All findings presented above are based on a subset of 2887 physicists with a career spanning at least 20 years and a persistent publication record . These scientists have reached a mid - or late - career stage and hence can be considered successful as they survived many selection pro - cesses in academia . Although our findings hold in at least six more different disciplines ( see section S1 . 2 ) and are robust to relaxing the se - lection criteria ( see section S1 . 4 ) , the studied data sets do not feature young scientists who have left academia early and hence have published only a few papers . Throughout this work , we have treated long - term impact , as captured by c 10 * , as an exogenous variable . It seems reasonable , however , that pro - ductivity and impact could influence each other . From a mechanistic perspective , for example , some early promising publications might help attract the resources leading to further productivity growth . Early - career impact , quantified with the average h c 10 i for the first 10 papers of a scientist , is as - sociated with career longevity , indicating that the probability to stay in academia is slightly influenced by the impact of a scientist ’ s early publications ( fig . S49 ) . The Q - model also indi - cates that the overall number of papers in a career weakly correlates with high Q ( Eq . 2 ) . Although the Q - model and the predictions pro - vided here are immune from a possible coupling between early impact and overall productivity ( section S5 ) , these preliminary findings call for more measurements and models that can accu - rately capture the coevolution of short - term early impact and productivity ( 37 ) . Although Q can accurately predict a career impact , the dependence of Q on exogenous fac - tors , such as the quality of the education and cur - rent institution ( 38 , 39 ) , size of the research community ( 24 , 40 ) , gender ( 41 , 42 ) , dynamics of subfields ( 43 , 44 ) , or publication habits , re - mains unknown . Mathematically speaking , the model remains the same if the Q parameter re - flects other factors that characterize a scientist . The various robustness checks we performed to discover possible confounding factors , such as career length , decade , team effects , and the analysis aaf5239 - 6 4 NOVEMBER 2016 (cid:127) VOL 354 ISSUE 6312 sciencemag . org SCIENCE Fig . 5 . Stability of the Q parameter . ( A ) Time variation of the Q parameter during individual careers . For scientists with at least 100 papers and Q ≃ 1 . 2 , Q ≃ 3 . 8 , and Q ≃ 6 . 5 , we report Q ( D N ) , measured in a moving window of D N = 30 papers . For 75 % of the scientists , the fluctuations are because we have a finite number of papers in the moving window , the magnitude of the changes being comparable to that predicted by the model with a constant Q ( section S4 . 9 ) . ( B ) Fluctuations of the Q parameter in model and data . We study the distribution of the uncertainty , Q ð D N Þ Q , in both data and syn - thetic careers with constant Q ( D N = 5 ) . For 74 . 7 % of the scientists , the fluctuations are comparable to those of the model . For the remaining 25 . 3 % , the SD is slightly higher than the one predicted by the model . ( C ) Comparison between early and late Q parameter . We compare the Q parameter at early - career ( Q early ) and late - career ( Q late ) stage of 823 scientists with at least 50 papers . We measured the two values of the parameters using only the first and second half of published papers , respectively . We perform these measurements on the real data ( circles ) and on randomized careers , where the order of papers is shuffled ( gray shaded areas ) . For most of the careers , 95 . 1 % , the changes between early - and late - career stages fall within the fluctuations predicted by the null model with randomized paper order , indicating that the Q parameter is stable throughout a career . The observed fluctuations are explained by the finite number of papers in a scientist ’ s career .

Most likely , the Q parameter is affected by multiple factors , rather than a single one , and more information about its nature might be un - veiled once other detailed career information , such as grants and awards , will be available and included in the analysis . Nevertheless , the key differentiating factor of Q from luck is that it has to be sustained . Q is not determined by a single paper , a lucky draw , but by a sustained high performance , throughout the scientist ’ s career . This is reflected in the h log c 10 i term in Eq . 3 , indicating that a single very high impact paper has only a small impact on Q . A scientist needs multiple high c 10 papers to ensure a high Q . Uncovering the origin of the Q parameter is a promising future goal , which not only could offer a better understanding of the emergence and evolution of scientific excellence but also might improve our ability to train and nurture high - impact scientists . Methods Data sets We explore two types of data sets : ( i ) the pub - lication record of 236 , 884 physicists publishing in the journal family Physical Review from 1893 to 2010 [ American Physical Society ( APS ) data set , see section S1 . 1 and figs . S1 and S2 ] and ( ii ) the combination of 24 , 630 Google Scholar ca - reer profiles with Web of Science ( WoS ) data , covering 514 , 896 publications in biology , chem - istry , cognitive sciences , ecology , economics , and neuroscience ( WoS data set , described in section S1 . 2 and fig . S3 ) . The results shown in this article refer to 2887 scientists , whose publication record spans at least 20 years , who have at least 10 pub - lications and have authored at least one paper every 5 years , derived from the APS data set ( see section S1 . 3 ) .

Each curve represents the frac - tion of Nobel lau - reates versus the fraction of other sci - entists for a given rank threshold . The diagonal ( no - discrimination line ) corresponds to ran - dom ranking ; the area under each curve pro - vides our accuracy to rank high Nobel lau - reates . The ranking accuracy is reported in the legend , 1 being the maximum . Precision and recall as a function of rank are discussed in section S7 . ( B ) Expected citations to the highest - impact paper , c 10 * , for a scien - tist with parameter Q and N publications . The plot illustrates the very low chance of a low Q researcher to publish a high - impact paper . ( C ) Observed versus pre - dicted growth of the h - index for scientists with different Q . The plot documents the agreement between the analytically predicted h - index ( eq . S38 , continuous line ) and the observed value 〈 h ( N ) 〉 , obtained by averaging the h - index for scientists with the same Q ( circles ) . ( D ) Top : Growth of the h - index for two scientists with at least 200 papers and different Q as a function of the productivity N ( blue circles ) , compared with the prediction of eq . S38 ( red line ) . Bottom : For the two scientists in the top panels , we measure the cumulative number of citations as a function of N , Ctot ( N ) , and compare with the prediction of eq . S39 . The close agreement between observation and prediction in ( C ) and ( D ) shows that the time - independent Q captures an intrinsic property of a scientist and that other indicators , like the h - index or cumulative citations , are uniquely determined by Q and productivity . ( E ) For two scientists , we show the h - index prediction as a function of N using only early - career information , namely , N 0 = 20 ( top ) and N 0 = 50 ( bottom ) , to estimate the Q parameter . Although the initial h - index up to N 0 = 20 highly overlaps for the two scientists , their long - term impact diverges , a difference accurately predicted by the Q - model . ( F ) Scatterplots of predicted and real h - index at N = 60 based on Q estimated at N 0 = 20 . The error bars indicate prediction quartiles ( 25 and 75 % ) in each bin and are colored green if y = x lies between the two quartiles in that bin and red otherwise . The circles correspond to the average h - index in that bin . ( G ) The z N score for each scientist cap - tures the number of SDs the real h - index deviates from the most likely h - index after N publications . z N ≤ 2 indicates that the real data are within the prediction envelope .

Our findings are also supported by the anal - ysis of different samples of scientists in the APS data set , selected using a number of different criteria ( see section S1 . 4 ) , and by the analysis of all other disciplines in the WoS data set , which are reported in the Supplementary Materials and referenced throughout the article . Citation measures Citation - based measures of impact are affected by three major problems : ( i ) citations follow dif - ferent dynamics for different papers ( 6 , 45 ) , ( ii ) the average number of citations changes over time ( 24 ) and ( iii ) citation count is subfield - dependent ( 24 ) . To overcome ( i ) for each paper , we use the cumulative number of citations the paper received 10 years after its publication , c 10 , as a measure of its scientific impact ( 6 , 45 ) . We can correct for ( ii ) and ( iii ) by normalizing c 10 by the average h c 10 i of papers published in the same year . Because these corrections do no t alter our conclusions for the APS data set , we report results without normalization . For the WoS data set , we instead used normalized citation counts . Q - model The stochastic process behind the Q - model is determined by the joint probability P ( p , Q , N ) . The model assumes that a scientist i has a pro - ductivity N i and a parameter Q i sampled from the marginal distribution P ( Q , N ) , and then ex - tracts N i values of p from the conditional dis - tribution P ( p | Q , N ) . By assuming that P ( p , Q , N ) follows a trivariate log - normal distribution with parameters m and S , we can write the likelihood function L i that a scientist i with Q i and N i has a sequence of papers { a } with impact { Q i p a } ( see Eq . 1 ) . Finally , with numerical optimization methods , we identify the maximum of the over - all log - likelihood function log L = S i L i , which provides the numerical estimate of m and S re - ported in Eq . 2 ( see also sections S4 . 3 and S4 . 4 ) . This approach also estimates Q i , obtained by maximizing the likelihood function L i for each scientist . The maximization provides an analytical expression for Q i , which , for large productivity N i , converges to Eq . 3 ( see section S4 . 5 ) This procedure and the measured parame - ters allow us to generate synthetic sequences of publications : We first extract an individual parameter Q and a productivity N from the distribution P ( Q , N ) . Then , each paper in the synthetic sequence is assigned an impact pQ , where p is randomly drawn from the distribution P ( p ) , identical for all scientists . REFERENCES AND NOTES 1 . I .

The authors developed a quantitative paper with the greatest impact occurs randomly in a scientist ' s career . However , the process of productivity ( which is usually greatest early in the scientist ' s professional life ) is accounted for , the publications of 2887 physicists , as well as data on scientists publishing in a variety of fields .
