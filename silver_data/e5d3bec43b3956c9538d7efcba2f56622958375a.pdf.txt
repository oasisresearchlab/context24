Czyborra 1 In the COVID‑19 pandemic , children were considered to play a major role in SARS‑CoV‑2 transmission similar to influenza . Thus , mitigation measures have been focused on children , impacting their everyday life severely . Despite this , infectivity in this age group regarding SARS‑CoV‑2 is not yet clarified . We performed a serology study in households with confirmed SARS‑CoV‑2 infection to evaluate virus transmission with focus on children and adolescents . Between January and July 2021 , 341 minors and 650 adults from 300 households with a confirmed index case participated in the FamilyCoviDD19‑study including serological assessment for SARS‑CoV‑2 antibodies and a questionnaire on demographics , recent and ongoing symptoms , hygiene measures and comorbidities . 45 ( 16 . 3 % ) of all index cases were < 18 years old . Thereof , 55 . 6 % reported COVID‑19 associated symptoms , while nearly all adult index cases were symptomatic ( 94 . 8 % ) . There was significantly less virus transmission by children and adolescents compared to adult index cases with a secondary attack rate of 0 . 29 vs . 0 . 54 . With the caveat that the results do not necessarily apply to the Delta and Omicron variants , we conclude that children and adolescents are less susceptible for SARS‑CoV‑2 infection , more frequently show an asymptomatic course of disease and are less infective than adults . Since the emergence of the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) and the beginning of the pandemic 1 , various mitigation measures have been implemented to contain the spread of the virus . As children often show pauci - or asymptomatic disease , which results in undetected infections 2 , 3 , it was widely assumed that children are more likely to spread the coronavirus . Similar to the influenza epidemics 4 , children and adolescents were considered to play a leading role in the COVID - 19 pandemic and thus strong measures e . g . school closing and frequent testing have been implemented . All of which has specifically impacted this age group . Restricting access of public spaces to those who are fully recovered , vaccinated or otherwise tested has further deprived children of participation in society . It has been shown , that social isolation during the pan - demic affects the mental health of children and adolescents , increasing the risk of anxiety and depression 5 – 7 . At the same time the limited access to public spaces created growing social pressure on children to get vaccinated although the benefit - risk ratio for healthy children is still under debate 8 – 10 . However , since there is little data on the infectivity of children and adolescents , there exists limited evidence for the justification of the prevention strategies and the vaccination recommendations that apply to minors . To strike a balance between the contain - ment of the pandemic and child’s education and mental health , there is a need for infection control measures that are both highly effective and unrestrictive as possible . We conducted a seroprevalence study in households with at least one confirmed case of SARS - CoV - 2 to deter - mine the transmission rates within a setting of close human contact with a focus on children and adolescents . This was done to characterize the susceptibility and infectiveness towards the novel coronavirus and to further define risk factors of virus transmission . Moreover , we evaluated the effectiveness of specific hygiene measures implemented in the household during quarantine as well as risk factors for prolonged symptoms .

Median age of the participants was 33 [ 15 – 46 ] and 341 / 991 ( 34 . 4 % ) were < 18 years of age ( see Fig . 1 for the exact age distribution ) . In total , 950 participants consented to blood collection and were tested for antibodies against SARS - CoV - 2 . Of the 950 participants , 587 ( 61 . 8 % ) were seropositive . An index case was identified in 276 / 300 ( 92 % ) households . 244 ( 88 . 4 % ) of all index cases reported a symptomatic infection with a significant difference between index cases < 18 years old and index cases ≥ 18 years old ( 55 . 6 % vs 94 . 8 % ; p < 0 . 0001 ) . The ratio of index cases < 18 ( 16 . 3 % ) and ≥ 18 years old ( 83 . 7 % ) was also clearly different . 229 / 276 ( 83 . 0 % ) index cases were seropositive in our analysis . This ratio was the same for index cases < 18 and ≥ 18 years of age . 370 ( 63 % ) of all seropositive participants reported a previous positive SARS - CoV - 2 PCR . In addition , participants with comorbidities were more likely to be seropositive ( 68 . 3 % vs 55 . 9 % , p < 0 . 001 ) and to have symptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 - infections ( 69 . 4 % vs 56 . 4 % ; p < 0 . 0001 ) compared to those without .

In 112 / 299 ( 37 . 5 % ) house - holds all household members were seropositive . There was a lower chance that everyone in the household was seropositive with a minor index case than with an index case ≥ 18 years ( 18 . 2 % vs 43 . 8 % ; p = 0 . 0013 ) ( Table 2 ) . Accordingly , the SAR of underage index cases was significantly lower compared to ≥ 18 years old index cases ( 0 . 29 vs 0 . 54 ; p < 0 . 0001 ) ( Table 3 ) . Specifically , transmission from adult index cases to household contacts < 18 years was more common than vice versa ( SAR 0 . 48 vs 0 . 29 ; p = 0 . 017 ) . Children and adolescents generally transmitted SARS - CoV - 2 - infections less frequently to both adult and underage household contacts ( SAR 0 . 29 ) . When comparing transmissions within households with PCR confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 - infections to those in which the SARS - CoV - 2 - infection was detected only retrospectively by serology , we found that SAR was significantly higher within households with a positive PCR ( 0 . 52 vs 0 . 22 ; p < 0 . 0001 ) . Even when a household did not follow any hygiene measures dur - ing quarantine , SAR was higher than in households that were unaware of their SARS - CoV - 2 - infection ( 0 . 53 vs 0 . 22 ; p < 0 . 0001 ) . Accordingly , in households with a symptomatic index person there was a higher chance that every participant from the household was seropositive ( 44 . 1 % vs 0 % ; p < 0 . 0001 ) . The seropositivity rate was also dependant of the household size as it decreased significantly for each additional household member . In house - holds with more than 4 members the probability of all household members being seropositive was significantly lower compared to households with only two members ( 17 . 6 % vs . 63 . 9 % ; p < 0 . 0001 ) .

To analyse the effect of hygiene measures on transmission , participants were asked if they were following specific hygiene measures e . g . physical distancing , wearing of masks or regular room ventilation . Interestingly , the overall SAR was the same in households that implemented hygiene measures to those that did not ( 0 . 53 ) ( Table 4 ) . When the index case left the household ( 6 / 211 households ) as soon as the infection was confirmed , there was a 33 . 3 % chance that no other household member was seropositive ( SAR of 0 . 36 ) , whilst this was only the case in 15 % of the households without any measures ( SAR 0 . 53 ) . Due to the low case numbers , this was not statistically significant . Long‑term effects of COVID‑19 . To evaluate the severity and long - term effect of the infection , partici - pants were asked about current medical conditions at the time of blood collection . Results are displayed in Table 5 as ongoing symptoms < 12 weeks and ≥ 12 weeks after SARS - CoV - 2 infection and analysed according to specific characteristics of the participants . When the infection was < 12 weeks ago 25 % of the participants suffered from ongoing symptoms while participants that were enrolled ≥ 12 weeks after their infection reported health restrictions in 29 . 7 % . Seropositive participants were more likely to have persistent symptoms both < 12 and ≥ 12 weeks after infection within their household , but interestingly , seronegative participants also reported ongoing symptoms ( < 12 weeks : 31 . 5 % vs 14 . 5 % and ≥ 12 weeks : 34 . 8 % vs 20 . 8 % ; p < 0 . 001 ) . When analysing only participants < 18 years of age , differences in ongoing symptoms between seronegative and seropositive par - ticipants were not significant . Individuals that reported SARS - CoV - 2 related symptoms in the acute phase were more often suffering from ongoing symptoms than asymptomatic participants both < 12 and ≥ 12 weeks after Table 4 .

Generally , adults were more likely to develop ongoing symptoms compared to children and teenag - ers < 18 years ( < 12 weeks : 32 . 6 % vs 8 . 2 % ; p < 0 . 0001 and ≥ 12 weeks : 41 . 9 % vs 3 . 8 % ; p < 0 . 0001 ) . Furthermore , participants > 40 years of age were more likely to have ongoing symptoms up to 12 weeks after infection than young adults ( 46 . 9 % vs 21 . 3 % ; p < 0 . 01 ) . When participants ≥ 18 years were enrolled ≥ 12 weeks after the infection , they more often reported medical issues than those seen within 12 weeks after infection ( 41 . 9 % vs 32 . 6 % ) while the rate of continuing symptoms in minor participants decreased over time ( < 12 weeks 8 . 2 % vs ≥ 12 weeks 3 . 8 % ) . The probability of ongoing symptoms did not only correlate with age but with sex . Female participants had a higher prevalence of ongoing symptoms ≥ 12 weeks after the infection compared to male participants ( 40 . 4 % vs 17 . 5 % ; p < 0 . 0001 ) . Consistent with higher infection rates and seroprevalence , participants with comorbidities were more likely to experience persisting symptoms after the infection ( < 12 weeks : 42 . 5 % vs 17 . 8 % ; p < 0 . 0001 and > 12 weeks : 41 . 0 % vs 24 . 5 % ; p < 0 . 01 ) . Here , seropositive participants were significantly more affected than seronegative subjects ( 47 . 5 % vs 21 . 6 % ; p < 0 . 005 ) . Comorbidities have been reported by 284 / 991 ( 28 . 7 % ) par - ticipants and included hypertension and hypothyreosis most frequently . Specifically , 57 / 341 ( 16 . 7 % ) of children and adolescents had comorbidities of which atopic diseases accounted for most chronic diseases . BMI did not have any influence on the rate of ongoing symptoms in participants ≥ 18 years old , but children and adolescents with a BMI > 25 were more likely to report ongoing symptoms ≥ 12 weeks after the infection than those of lower BMI ( 22 . 2 % vs 2 . 2 % , p < 0 . 05 ) . Discussion In this prospective seroprevalence study , we analysed SARS - CoV - 2 - transmission in 300 households with con - firmed index - cases to evaluate infectivity and susceptibility in a setting of close contact . We found that 587 / 950 ( 61 . 8 % ) household members were seropositive after an event of SARS - CoV - 2 - infection within their household . This rate is higher than in a previous analysis from January 2021 11 and most other studies 12 – 14 . While the incident rate was the same in children and adults in the household setting , only 16 . 3 % of the index cases were < 18 years old , indicating that SARS - CoV - 2 - infections were mostly introduced into the household by an adult household member . Additionally , the SAR was much lower for underage index cases compared to that of adult index cases . Children and adolescents were less likely to infect both household contacts of the same age and adult household contacts ( SAR 0 . 29 ) , which indicates a lower infectivity in this age group . This is in line with several previous studies 15 – 17 while some others found children to be more likely than adults to transmit the virus 18 . However , overall , SARS - CoV - 2 transmission rates from children seem to be lower in contrast to other respiratory viruses , for which children were found responsible for most of transmission clusters 19 . In addition to the lower SAR in children and adolescents in our study , participants in this age group showed fewer symptoms during infection and were more often asymptomatic compared to adults which is very consistently described in literature 2 , 20 , 21 . This indicates that an asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 - infection is associated with a reduced infectivity and contradicts the assumption that children quickly spread the virus because of asymptomatic and therefore undetected infections . This evidence is in line with observations in other studies 22 . In households , that were enrolled only after positive seroanalysis of a child or adolescent within the SchoolCoviDD19 - study and did not know of any event of SARS - CoV - 2 - infection within their household , the SAR was the lowest of all ( SAR 0 . 22 ) , which supports this theory . In contrast to other studies , we did not identify any hygiene measures that were associated with a reduced seropositivity rate within the household . This seems logical considering that the infectivity is highest even before and until shortly after the first symptoms 23 , 24 while hygiene measures are implemented only when the infection is PCR - confirmed a few days later . Wang et al . found combined hygiene measures to only be effective when implemented before the beginning of symptoms 25 . Therefore , they serve as a preventative measure rather than a mechanism used after detection of the virus . Otherwise , the lack of effect of the hygiene measures might also indicate a higher contagiousness of the alpha variant since similar previous studies could detect an effect . Sometime after the start of the pandemic , discussions emerged about ongoing or recurring symptoms after the initial SARS - CoV - 2 - infection , the so - called Long - COVID - syndrome . In this study we screened for the presence of any symptom at the time of the study visit and found that nearly every third participant reported any ongoing symptom . These symptoms were clearly associated with a symptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 - infection and with a posi - tive serostatus . However , it is important to mention , that 20 . 8 % of the seronegative participants also reported symptoms ≥ 12 weeks after COVID - 19 within their household . Even though there is no seroconversion in about 10 % of people after a SARS - CoV - 2 infection 26 , 27 , these results show that there is a certain background incidence of medical conditions that is not related to the virus infection . Part of it most likely represents a baseline level of non - specific symptoms within our population which might be elevated due to the restrictions during the pandemic . Furthermore there is evidence , that ongoing symptoms cluster within households 28 . Seronegative but exposed individuals were more likely to experience ongoing symptoms when infected household members reported ongoing symptoms . This phenomenon should be considered when patients present Long - COVID - like symptoms . This is important to not over - or misdiagnose , and to involve other household members into the therapy . Our findings suggest that the rate of Long - COVID - syndrome is overestimated as many studies on Long - COVID did not include seronegative control groups and have thus not taken into account the baseline preva - lence of ongoing symptoms 29 , 30 . In line with the milder course of COVID - 19 in children and adolescents , they were least often suffering from ongoing symptoms while the rate of prolonged disease increased with age . More importantly , in contrast to adults , there was no significant difference in the rate of ongoing symptoms between seropositive and seronegative children and adolescents . In our SchoolCoViDD19 - study we recently found the same results when screening 1560 students for Long - COVID - symptoms , which again suggests an overestimation of Long - COVID - syndrome within < 18 year olds and provides further evidence of a significant negative effect of 6 Vol : .

Our study detected comorbidity as a risk factor for ongoing symptoms and this was specifically associated with the SARS - CoV - 2 - infection as seronegative participants with comorbidities suffered significantly less often from ongoing symptoms . Previous studies showed that common medical conditions e . g . diabetes or hypertension are risk factors for severe COVID - 19 and increased mortality 31 . Limitations . We did not screen households for SARS - CoV - 2 infection with the agenda of recruiting them for our study . Rather households were invited to participate in our study upon proof of SARS - CoV - 2 infection of at least one household member , no matter their reason for the testing . This may influence the representation of index cases in our study and may be dependent on current testing strategies . However , an index case was not necessarily defined by a positive PCR or antibody result but beginning of symptoms was also considered . Moreo - ver , 44 . 9 % of the participants reported that PCR tests were done because of symptoms and 32 . 5 % had been tested because of a positive contact . Only 4 . 1 % of the tests were done as a routine testing at work or in school , which reveals that index case detection was not dependent of the public testing strategy in our study . Screening for Long - COVID - syndrome in a questionnaire is always vulnerable to bias . To minimize the recall bias in our study , we did not specifically mention Long - COVID - symptoms but asked if any symptoms were present at the time of the study visit . This was done before the participants knew about their serostatus . A certain bias in the ongoing symptoms of young children cannot be excluded as parents may have helped with filling the questionnaire . The results of our study are related to infections at the time the Wuhan and alpha variant were the predomi - nant SARS - CoV - 2 variants . Therefore , different virus characteristics should be considered when comparing this study to recent studies . Since there is a higher transmissibility of the omicron variant , the overall SAR will likely be higher than with the alpha variant . However , differences in transmission between children and adults should remain similar as shown recently by Lyngse et al . 32 . At the same time , the virulence of the omicron variant is significantly lower than that of alpha , which may affect the incidence of ongoing symptoms . Conclusion In line with previous studies and clinical reports , we could show that children and teenagers of < 18 years of age did not only have a milder course of COVID - 19 33 , but they were less prone to be infected with SARS - CoV - 2 , and most importantly , less likely to transmit it to their household members . Several other studies found that children and adolescents have a similar seroprevalence for SARS - CoV - 2 as adults 34 and some even reported that the infectivity seems to be reduced 35 , but still most conclude that because of the same susceptibility as adults plus the undetected cases , strict hygiene measures and surveillance should be implemented to prevent SARS - CoV - 2 - spreading in day cares and schools . However , our study could not confirm an overrepresentation of children and adolescents in SARS - CoV - 2 cases 36 but also shows that their probability to transmit the virus is much lower than that of adult index cases . Consequently , the focus of pandemic control should be directed more towards adults than children and adolescents . Methods Households with a confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 - infection were contacted by the local Health Department and invited to participate in the FamilyCoviDD19 - study in order to investigate SARS - CoV - 2 seroprevalence and to define possible risk factors for infection , transmission and prolonged symptoms . The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Technical University of Dresden ( BO - EK - 342072020 ) and was performed according to the declaration of Helsinki . Upon informed consent from all participants or their legal guardians , a blood sample was taken from the participants and information about their demographics , past episodes of illness , PCR - testing for SARS - CoV - 2 , hygiene measures during quarantine as well as their current state of health was obtained using a questionnaire ( which can be found online as Supplementary Methods ) . Participants were asked to fill in the questionnaire before the blood sampling to avoid bias by the result of the seroanalysis . Cohort description . Between 18th January and 20th July 2021 , 394 households were enrolled into the seroprevalence FamilyCoviDD19 study . Upon a positive SARS - CoV - 2 - PCR test , 254 households were enrolled whilst 46 were enrolled after positive antibody testing in our seroprevalence SchoolCoviDD19 - and KiTaCov - iDD19 - study 37 , 38 . Eventually , 21 households were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria ( no other household member of the index person participated or household members did not have any contact dur - ing the infection period ) . A further 73 households were excluded in this analysis because at least one household member was vaccinated for SARS - CoV - 2 . This was done to exclude bias in the calculation of the secondary attack rate by vaccination based seropositivity . Seroanalysis . The detection of antibodies against SARS - CoV - 2 was performed with the Diasorin LIASON SARS - CoV - 2 S1 / S2 IgG Assay . If equivocal or positive , the result was confirmed with a second assay , either the Abbott Diagnostics ARCHITECT SARS - CoV - 2 or the Euroimmun Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 ELISA . The participants’ serostatus was deemed positive , if at least 2 of 3 tests were positive . Epidemiological situation . The study visits took place between January and July 2021 , the participants’ infections , however , date to a period from October 2020 to May 2021 with a clear peak in December 2020 and January 2021 representing Germany’s second COVID - 19 infection wave . The 7 - day - incidence rate in Saxony ranged from 120 . 1 to 444 . 4 / 100 . 000 during this period . In terms of the predominant virus variant , this period represents a transition from the original Wuhan variant to the alpha variant ( B1 . 1 . 7 ) . During this period , Saxony 7 Vol . : ( 0123456789 ) Scientific Reports | ( 2022 ) 12 : 22453 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 022 - 24643 - 2 www . nature . com / scientificreports / was in strict lockdown which included a curfew and complete closing of schools , kindergardens , restaurants and shops that did not serve basic supply . There was no regular mandatory testing for any part of the population . Wearing of medical face masks was mandatory in supermarkets and public transport . Definitions and variables of interest . For every household , one index case was determined if possible . An index case was defined as the person who was most probable the first one infected according to onset of symptoms , positive test or serological testing . In a first approach , to evaluate the transmission within the house - holds , we classified households according to the serostatus of their household members . They were categorized according to whether no household member was seropositive , only the index case was seropositive , some house - hold members were seropositive or all household members were seropositive . For a more specific analysis we further calculated the secondary attack rate ( SAR ) as a function of seropositive contacts out of all contacts of the index person within the household . Finally , all participants were asked for any health restrictions at the time of the study visit to evaluate the prevalence of ongoing symptoms after COVID - 19 . Their responses were analysed based on the time interval between the infection / quarantine and the study visit and classified as “ < 12 weeks” or “ 12 weeks” 39 . Data analysis and statistics . All data was managed , and calculations were done in Excel . Statistical analy - sis was done in GraphPad Prism v9 using Fisher’s exact test for 2 × 2 contingency tables and Chi Square for 2 × 4 contingency tables as indicated .
