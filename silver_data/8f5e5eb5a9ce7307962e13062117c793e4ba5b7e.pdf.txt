This work considers the large and small disciplines , calculates the interdisciplinary distance , and analyzes the in ﬂ uence of interdisciplinary behavior and interdisciplinary distance in the academic network . The results show that the risk of interdisciplinary behavior in the large discipline is more signi ﬁ cant than the bene ﬁ ts .

KEYWORDS interdisciplinary behavior , scienti ﬁ c in ﬂ uence , large and small disciplines , interdisciplinary distance , causal inference 1 Introduction Modern science aims to solve complex and large - scale social and natural problems [ 1 , 2 ] . These systematic researches raises higher requirements on participating research team [ 3 – 5 ] , which raises higher requirements on participating research teams . For example , collaborators may need expertise in different disciplines [ 6 ] . Furthermore , with the in - depth penetration of interdisciplinary expertise , the inherent boundaries of science have been broken , and interdisciplinary behavior has become more popular in modern science [ 7 ] . In addition , some pioneering researches involve expertise that often exceeds the scope of knowledge of a single discipline [ 8 , 9 ] . Nowadays , interdisciplinary research achieves knowledge breakthroughs and innovations through colliding ideas between different disciplines , which is considered a signi ﬁ cant feature and future trend of science society [ 10 ] . However , the study and the underlying operation mechanisms of interdisciplinarity are still in their infancy . With the successive emergence of academic databases , e . g . , Web of Science , Scopus , PubMed , and Microsoft Academic Graph , these databases provide data support for interdisciplinary research . Currently , interdisciplinary research mainly focuses on three aspects : 1 ) interdisciplinary metrics ; 2 ) interdisciplinary - related policies and funding ; and 3 ) interdisciplinary in ﬂ uence . The most commonly used measurements to evaluate interdisciplinarity are publications and citations . And the derived index of interdisciplinarity quanti ﬁ es the diversity of disciplines involved in a paper [ 11 , 12 ] . Based on the publications , interdisciplinary diversity can de ﬁ ne with three dimensions [ 13 ] , i . e . , variety , balance , and disparity . Subsequent research has expanded the measurement dimensions by adding the concept of similarity and adopting cohesiveness [ 14 ] . Meanwhile , interdisciplinary research related to citation has also been explored and discovered . For example , the analysis based on citation showed that the knowledge structure of literature has changed and became increasingly interdisciplinary [ 15 ] .

Frontiers in Physics frontiersin . org 01 TYPE Original Research PUBLISHED 19 January 2023 DOI 10 . 3389 / fphy . 2023 . 1107446 a recent study further explored the interdisciplinary citation index and the weighted forms , and conducted veri ﬁ cation in different disciplines [ 16 ] . Interdisciplinary research has attracted more and more attention and one of these foci is to investigate the policy and funding of interdisciplinary research [ 17 – 20 ] . Several prominent institutions have begun to emphasize and encourage the development of interdisciplinary research , such as the interdisciplinary development program of the National Academy of Sciences [ 21 ] . However , the evaluation of interdisciplinary funding in the academic ﬁ eld is mixed . One voice says interdisciplinary research is merely a policy incentive without ﬁ nancial support [ 22 ] , i . e . , interdisciplinary research is often unrewarding . For example , researchers have shown that interdisciplinary research has a lower citation and funding success rate [ 23 ] . On the contrary , another voice against this conclusion [ 24 ] showed that interdisciplinary scientists play an essential role in knowledge dissemination and are superior to scientists in traditional research for both the amount and scale of funding . Furthermore , the underlying relationship between interdisciplinarity and scientists ’ in ﬂ uence [ 25 – 27 ] remains to be investigated . Previous researches provide con ﬂ icting evidence . On the one hand , it may be caused by the different de ﬁ nitions of interdisciplinarity . For example , scientists ﬁ nd that interdisciplinarity in physics has a negative in ﬂ uence when they measure the interdisciplinary by calculating the proportion of papers published in other disciplines [ 28 ] . Meanwhile , studies on biomedical disciplines show a negative correlation between interdisciplinarity and citation growth [ 29 ] . However , a recent study indicates that interdisciplinary papers receive more citations when interdisciplinarity is combined with novelty [ 30 ] . Furthermore , research about journals ’ analysis shows that papers published in journals with multiple disciplinary classi ﬁ cations receive fewer citations than papers published in disciplinary journals with clear disciplinary boundaries [ 31 ] . On the other hand , interdisciplinary analysis based on speci ﬁ c disciplines may lead to deviations . For example , biology and chemistry have a high degree of overlap in expertise , and collaborations among these disciplines tend to receive high citations in target disciplines , both for biology and chemistry . Meanwhile , low citation rates in computer science and humanities interdisciplinary may be caused by the low coverage of literature published in the interdisciplinary disciplines [ 32 ] . Although academic ﬁ elds spend an enormous amount of time and energy on analyzing interdisciplinary behavior , the relationship between interdisciplinary and scientists ’ in ﬂ uence is still in its infancy . In this work , we propose the concepts of large and small disciplines and compare the changes in the in ﬂ uence of papers and scientists under interdisciplinary behavior . The main contributions of this work are summarized as follows . (cid:129) Our work examines a total of 4 . 9 million papers over the last 20 years and utilizes statistics and causal inference to quantify scientists ’ in ﬂ uence on interdisciplinary behavior . (cid:129) We ﬁ nd that the risk is greater than the bene ﬁ t for the large across small discipline , and the opposite trend in the small discipline . Furthermore , we explore the relationship between scientists ’ in ﬂ uence and interdisciplinary distance . The results suggest that there exists a “ Sweet Spot ” which could bring signi ﬁ cant rewards . (cid:129) We reveal and analyze the causal relationship between scientists ’ in ﬂ uence and interdisciplinary behavior . The rest of the paper is organized as follows . Section 2 introduces the data preparation and the methods . Section 3 demonstrates the results of scientists ’ in ﬂ uence on interdisciplinary behavior . Finally , Section 4 concludes the investigation with some discussions . 2 Dataset and methods 2 . 1 Data preparation This work uses the dataset from Aminer 1 . As the release dataset version continues to update , it has become more popular and used for analyzing the information spread [ 33 ] , studying the scienti ﬁ c in ﬂ uence [ 34 – 36 ] , building recommendations in academic networks [ 37 , 38 ] , researching citation and cooperation networks [ 39 – 42 ] , and developing the prediction in academic networks [ 43 , 44 ] . This work adopts the 12 th version of the dataset , which includes 4 . 9 million papers from 113 , 887 disciplines . The majority of papers contain the paper number , title , scientists , publication , citation , and ﬁ eld information [ 45 ] . Speci ﬁ cally , the ﬁ eld information is extracted from Mircosoft Academic Graph ( MAG ) [ 46 ] , which contains ﬁ eld names and the weight w for ﬁ elds of study . We selected 3 , 054 , 175 papers from 2000 to 2019 , including 3 , 052 , 873 papers containing ﬁ eld information and 3 , 051 , 022 papers containing more than two ﬁ elds information . For papers without two ﬁ elds ’ information , we consider the ﬁ eld information according to the ﬁ elds ’ proportion of the reference list , e . g . , for paper P , the ﬁ eld A , B and C is 50 % , 40 % and 10 % in the reference list , we attribute ﬁ eld A and B to the paper P . 2 . 2 Field - normalization The in ﬂ uence meaning of citations in different ﬁ elds is different . In order to avoid the bias , ﬁ eld - normalization is needed . In this work , we introduce the method in [ 47 ] , and use a weight of the paper given by the dataset to eliminate the impact of the ﬁ eld . Speci ﬁ cally , we de ﬁ ne the citation C f of paper p by , C f (cid:1) (cid:1) k i (cid:1) 1 w i w 1 + w 2 + / + w k p C p C i ( 1 ) Here , k is the total number of ﬁ elds covered by paper p , i is one of the ﬁ elds ( i = 1 , 2 , 3 , . . . , k ) , and w i is the weight of the i - th ﬁ eld ; the ﬁ eld of research with weight w are given by the dataset ; C p is the number of citations we counted in the dataset ; C i is the total number of citations received in the i - th ﬁ eld . 2 . 3 Classi ﬁ cation and distance for discipline Our work explores the in ﬂ uence of interdisciplinary behavior based on large and small disciplines on scientists . Speci ﬁ cally , we extract the major and minor disciplines for the paper according to the ﬁ eld weight w and de ﬁ ne the top 5 % as the large discipline and the bottom 50 % as the small discipline . Then , we map the relationship Frontiers in Physics frontiersin . org 02 Fu et al . 10 . 3389 / fphy . 2023 . 1107446 between each paper and large or small disciplines according to citations . For example , paper A has received 10 , 5 , and two citations in F1 , F2 , and F3 disciplines , respectively . We can determine that the major discipline of paper A is F1 , and the minor is F2 . Finally , according to the major and minor disciplines , all papers in the data set can be classi ﬁ ed as the large discipline set P l − l , the large cross the small discipline set P l − s , the small discipline set P s − s , and the small cross the large discipline set P s − l . To quantify the discipline distance of inter - discipline , we utilize the method proposed by recent literature to measure the research interest evolution [ 48 ] . Speci ﬁ cally , all papers are attributed to the ﬁ rst scientist , and we have counted all authors in the data set who have continuously published papers for more than 6 years , and the maximum “ tolerance year ” is 2 years . For example , a scientist who has continuously published papers in 2000 and 2001 , and then continued to publish papers in 2003 , is also considered as consecutive publisher . Then we consider paper series for each consecutive publishing scientist as sorted by the publication period . We select three papers at the beginning and the end of the paper series for each scientist , regarded as the scienti ﬁ c outputs of the early and later careers , respectively . It should be noted that the early and late career we de ﬁ ned is not the scientists ’ career period , but the period before and after in a long time series . The dataset provides the discipline information representation of each paper , and we calculate the early and later discipline vector according to the discipline weight w . Finally , we can quantify the distance between the early and later career disciplines by calculating the cosine similarity of early and later career discipline vectors J . Figure 1 demonstrates an example of the speci ﬁ c calculation . 2 . 4 Causal inference Different from correlation analysis , causal inference is not only based on correlation but also requires the temporal order of causality . Thus , correlation is only a necessary and insuf ﬁ cient condition for causal inference . In recent decades , causal inference has been dramatically applied in various ﬁ elds , especially in ﬁ nance [ 49 ] and education [ 50 ] . With the development of arti ﬁ cial intelligence [ 51 – 53 ] , causal inference has new developments and applications [ 54 , 55 ] . Currently , the most basic causal inference is to estimate the treatment effect by comparing the differences between the observation results of the control and treatment groups . the expected value of the treatment effect of all individuals receiving treatment , i . e . , Average Treatment Effect on the Treated ( ATT ) , can be de ﬁ ned as , ATT (cid:1) E Y i 1 ( ) − Y i 0 ( ) | D i (cid:1) 1 [ ] ( 2 ) where D i = 1 means individual i is disposed , Y i ( 1 ) represents the observed value of individual i after treatment , Y i ( 0 ) represents the observed value of individual i in the control group . However , randomized controlled trials will consume a lot of time and resources , individuals participating in the experiment can only be grouped into the control or treatment group . Therefore , the current causal inference tends to analyze causal relationships from statistical data [ 56 ] , e . g . , Differences in Differences ( DID ) [ 57 ] , Granger Causality [ 58 ] , Propensity Score Matching ( PSM ) [ 59 ] , Generalized Propensity Score Matching ( GPS ) [ 60 ] , Instrumental Variable [ 61 ] , and Regression Discontinuity Design [ 62 ] . Compared with the above causal inference methods , DID is more suitable for panel data [ 63 ] . Speci ﬁ cally , we conduct the scientists into treatment and control groups according to whether they have interdisciplinary behavior , and the regression equation for DID can be written as , Y it (cid:1) β 0 + β 1 treat i + β 2 period t + β 3 treat i × period t + ε it ( 3 ) where Y it is a measurement of the in ﬂ uence ( citations ) of scientist i . treat i is a dummy variable for group membership and ε it is the error term . If scientist i has interdisciplinary behavior , then scientist i belongs to the treated group , treat i = 1 ; otherwise , treat i = 0 . period t is a dummy variable for the period . Assume that the time FIGURE 1 An example to calculate the interdisciplinary distance J ( m = 3 ) . The early careers ’ discipline vector α early and the later careers ’ discipline vector α later are generated based on the early and later m papers . Finally , the interdisciplinary distance J is measured according to the complementary cosine similarity between discipline vectors . Frontiers in Physics frontiersin . org 03 Fu et al . 10 . 3389 / fphy . 2023 . 1107446 for the interdisciplinary is t , and the observe time t i < t ( | t − t i | < = 2 ) , period t = 0 , otherwise period t = 1 . The composite variable treat i × period t is a dummy variable , indicating whether the individual of the treated group is in the treated period , and the coef ﬁ cient β 3 represents the treated effects for interdisciplinary behavior . It is worth noting that DID requires the treated and control group to be entirely in accord with the parallel trend assumption before the treatment , i . e . , the in ﬂ uence of scientists should increase at the same rate , whatever in treated and control groups . In addition , even if the parallel trend assumption is satis ﬁ ed , it is still necessary to control features that may affect scientists ’ in ﬂ uence , e . g . , the career years of the scientist , the number of cooperation scientists , and the total number of publications . Thus , this work investigates the relationship between interdisciplinary behavior and scientists ’ in ﬂ uence by utilizing PSM - DID . PSM transforms multi - dimensional features into one - dimensional propensity scores through a functional relationship , and matches individuals in the treatment group with the control group according to the propensity score . Speci ﬁ cally , we select four observable features ( covariates ) for 2 years before and after scientists ’ interdisciplinary behavior : 1 ) the total number of publications ; 2 ) the total number of disciplines of the scientist ; 3 ) the career ages of the scientist ; 4 ) the number of collaborators in each paper . Then , we calculate the propensity score of each scientist and conduct the match . The result of PSM provides supporting evidence for the parallel trend assumption . Finally , we consider citations and whether the scientist has interdisciplinary behavior as dependent and independent variables , respectively , and evaluate the treated effects of the treated group by utilizing DID . Another goal of this work is to quantify the causal relationship between interdisciplinary distance and scientists ’ in ﬂ uence , i . e . , the treated effect of continuous variables . However , the usual causal inference models allow only binary variables , i . e . , the treated variable = 0 ( 1 ) in the control ( treated ) . Thus , we consider utilizing the GPSM to evaluate the treated effect of interdisciplinary distance . GPSM is an extension of PSM and is widely used in many different ﬁ elds , such as economics [ 64 ] , education [ 65 ] , and medicine [ 66 ] . Furthermore , compared with the PSM , GPSM inherits the core concept and has similar covariate balancing properties . The most signi ﬁ cant advantage is that it breaks the PSM constraint that the treated variable only allows binary variables . We consider the relative citation growth rate in early and late careers as the quanti ﬁ cation of scientists ’ in ﬂ uence ( dependent variable ) . The independent variable is the interdisciplinary distance , and covariates are consistent in PSM . 3 Results 3 . 1 Citation dynamic of interdisciplinary paper Papers play an essential role in academic society , it is interesting to investigate the in ﬂ uence caused by interdisciplinary behavior . To investigate this , our work considers 2 years as the observed time ( t i ) and 3 years as the citation period to explore the citations of different types of interdisciplinary papers . Figure 2 compares the evolution of citations for papers with different interdisciplinary types . Compared with papers published in the large discipline ( P l − l ) , papers published in the large across small discipline ( P l − s ) receive lower average citations ( pink dot ) in each interval . However , the papers in the small across large discipline ( P s − l ) receive more average citations ( pink dot ) than that in the small discipline ( P s − s ) . On the one hand , it may be caused by the different citation dynamics in the inter - discipline and a single discipline , i . e . , interdisciplinary papers need more than 3 years to reach peak citations . On the other hand , the large discipline cross to the small discipline receives less recognition and attention , and peers agree more with papers of the small cross to the large discipline . FIGURE 2 The evolution of citations of papers within different interdisciplinary types . We classify papers as the large discipline ( blue box ) , the large across the small discipline ( orange box ) , the small discipline ( green box ) , and the small across large discipline ( red box ) . The solid line and the pink dot in box represent the median and average number of citations , respectively . Frontiers in Physics frontiersin . org 04 Fu et al . 10 . 3389 / fphy . 2023 . 1107446 In order to explore the underlying reasons for the different trends in the dynamic of papers with different types of interdisciplinary behaviors . We ﬁ rst investigate whether the interdisciplinary papers presented different citation dynamics from others by changing the citation period for papers . Figure 3 compares the citation period in three and 8 years in different disciplinary types . Papers published before 2008 are selected to avoid partial papers without 8 years citation period . When the citation period extends from 3 years ( Figure 3A ) to 8 years ( Figure 3B ) , the citation of papers in the large cross the small discipline is less than that in the large disciplines , whatever three and eight citation period . Furthermore , citations of papers in the small cross the large discipline exhibit similar trends . This result indicates that the short - and long - term in ﬂ uence of interdisciplinary papers is similar to that of other papers , i . e . , the increasing or decreasing of citations for interdisciplinary papers is irrelevant to the citation period . In particular , we further investigate the citation dynamics of papers in different disciplinary types published before 2008 in each year after publication . The average number of citation distribution is almost the same in different disciplines in Figure 4 . We adopt the Z - test and Kolmogorov - Smirnov ( K - S ) test to examine distributions ’ differences . Our null hypothesis is that the distribution of average citations of interdisciplinary papers is different from that of single - discipline papers . The result in Table 1 shows that P - value > 0 . 05 , whatever P l − l Vs . P l − s and P s − l Vs . P s − s , which refuses the null hypothesis , and indicates that the citation dynamics of interdisciplinary and single discipline are the same distribution . It further indicates that interdisciplinary behavior will increase or decrease the citations , but the citation dynamics for interdisciplinary papers are similar to others . One possible reason for the different trends in the citation of different types of interdisciplinary papers is the different recognition of scienti ﬁ c outputs . We analyze the citation sources for the different types of interdisciplinary papers within 8 years after publication in Figure 5 . The disciplines with the most cited papers published by the large discipline ( Figure 5A ) and the small discipline ( Figure 5C ) are the large discipline ( 44 % – 46 % ) and small disciplines ( 41 % – 51 % ) , respectively . It indicates that papers without interdisciplinary behavior have been widely recognized in self - discipline . Papers FIGURE 3 Theevolutionofcitationsofpaperswithindifferentinterdisciplinary types .

Compered Figure 5C with Figure 5D , despite the proportion of citations in the small across large discipline having decreased in the small disciplines , the proportion is the highest in different disciplines , i . e . , the initial disciplines ( the small disciplines ) tend to accept the scienti ﬁ c outputs in the small across large discipline .

Speci ﬁ cally , according to the interdisciplinary types and attributing each paper to the ﬁ rst scientist , we can de ﬁ ne an interdisciplinary type for the scientist , including the large discipline scientist ( S l − l ) , the large cross small discipline scientist ( S l − s ) , the small discipline scientists ( S s − s ) , and the small cross large discipline scientists ( S s − l ) . Since the dynamic distribution of citations in interdisciplinary papers is similar to that in others ( Figure 4 ) , we consider citations received within 3 years after publication to measure the scientists ’ in ﬂ uence . Figure 6 compares the citations of scientists in different interdisciplinary types . In total periods , the in ﬂ uence of scientists in the large across small discipline ( S l − s ) is lower than that of scientists in the large discipline ( S l − l ) except in 2000 . A different phenomenon is that scientists in the small across large discipline ( S s − l ) receive more positive impacts from interdisciplinary behaviors . This ﬁ nding indicates that the risk of interdisciplinary behavior of large disciplinary scientists is more signi ﬁ cant than the rewards . In contrast , scientists in small disciplines can enhance their in ﬂ uence through interdisciplinary behavior , which bene ﬁ ts the sustainable development of their careers . Table 2 demonstrates the result of DID in the different interdisciplinary types . As shown in Table 2 , the interdisciplinary behavior of scientists in S l − s signi ﬁ cantly reduces their in ﬂ uence , especially in 2004 , nearly reduced 2 . 6 citations . However , scientists in S s − l increase their in ﬂ uence on interdisciplinary behavior , and the most signi ﬁ cant increase occurred in 2016 , with an increase of about 7 . 2 citations . In general , our results exhibit a causal perspective for developing scientists ’ careers , especially for scientistsinthe small discipline . 3 . 3 The effect of interdisciplinary distance Interdisciplinary research is a tough career challenge for scientists , i . e . , the trade - off between the new research ﬁ eld and in ﬂ uence [ 67 ] . Thus , the scientist may balance the risks and bene ﬁ ts of interdisciplinary behavior . To ﬁ nd out the “ Sweet Spot ” in the transition , this work further explores the relationship between interdisciplinary distance and scientists ’ in ﬂ uence . Speci ﬁ cally , We consider J as the interdisciplinary distance and use the growth of citations to evaluate the scientists ’ in ﬂ uence . The growth of citations is de ﬁ ned as G c = ( C after − C before ) / C before , where C after and C after is the citations for scientists in early and later careers , respectively . Figure 7 compares the relationship between inter - discipline distance J and the growth of citations . We ﬁ nd that both long and short inter - disciplinary distances limit scientists ’ bene ﬁ ts and that only appropriate interdisciplinary distances could enhance the in ﬂ uence of scientists . Furthermore , the interdisciplinary also may introduce negative in ﬂ uence , which displays a uniform distribution ( inserted ﬁ gure in Figure 7 ) , which indicates that inter - disciplinary behavior may reduce the in ﬂ uence of scientists , whatever the interdisciplinary distance . This phenomenon suggests that scientists need to bear the risks through interdisciplinary behavior and turn an appropriate interdisciplinary distance if they want to increase their in ﬂ uence . We further investigate the underlying relationship between interdisciplinary distance and scientists ’ in ﬂ uence by utilizing GPSM . T A B L E 2 T h e r e s u l t o f D I D .

The result implies that interdisciplinary behavior is an effective way to enhance scientists ’ in ﬂ uence . Furthermore , there exists a “ Sweet spot ” for the in ﬂ uence introduced by interdisciplinary behavior , that is , the interdisciplinary distance is 0 . 16 . 4 Conclusion and discussion This work studies the underlying relationship between interdisciplinary and in ﬂ uence . By introducing the concept of the large and small disciplines , we ﬁ rst investigate the relationship between interdisciplinary behavior and citations . The results show that different types of interdisciplinary behaviors will have different effects on the citations , i . e . , the citations of papers from the large discipline across the small discipline will decrease , and the opposite trend in the small discipline . Then , we ﬁ nd that papers of the large discipline across the small discipline have been high - cited in the same interdisciplinary type papers , while peers in the small discipline will widely accept the paper of the small across the large discipline . The analysis of the relationship between interdisciplinary behavior and scientists ’ in ﬂ uence and the result of DID - PSM con ﬁ rm this phenomenon . The previous study also con ﬁ rmed that interdisciplinary research might have a high impact , but they may encounter challenges in collaboration and more obstacles in peer review [ 68 ] . Furthermore , the analysis of interdisciplinary distance and scientists ’ in ﬂ uence ﬁ nds that interdisciplinary behavior will bring risks , and there exists a “ Sweet spot ” for the in ﬂ uence introduced by interdisciplinary behavior . It is important for scientists to choose the appropriate interdisciplinary distance while undertaking the risks . The short interdisciplinary distance may lead to a low impact caused by the lack of novelty , and excessive interdisciplinary distance may lead scientists to work in entirely unfamiliar disciplines and descend the scienti ﬁ c in ﬂ uence . Furthermore , this work only considers the ﬁ rst author , i . e . , the credit of the paper attributes to the ﬁ rst author . With the increase of the number of co - authors of each publication , the scienti ﬁ c credit system is also facing the pressure of development [ 69 – 71 ] . Our future work will ﬁ nd a more reasonable credit allocation method to further reveal the potential in ﬂ uence of interdisciplinary behavior . In general , causality is the focus of research in the future academic network . Our research introduced causal inference into practice in the academic ﬁ eld . This work analyzes the correlation between interdisciplinary behavior and scientists ’ in ﬂ uence and reveals its potential impact mechanism by quantifying the causal relationship among them , which provides a new perspective for future related research in the academic ﬁ eld .
