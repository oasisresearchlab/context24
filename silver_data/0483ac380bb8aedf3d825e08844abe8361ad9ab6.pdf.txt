3496 Research Article Introduction Endocytosis is a highly regulated and essential process that occurs in the majority of eukaryotic cells . It is required for recycling of plasma membrane lipids and trafficking proteins , and for uptake or downregulation of cell - surface receptors . During endocytosis , the plasma membrane invaginates into the cell , resulting in the production of a vesicle that is then able to fuse with endosomes and enter the endolysosomal membrane system . This process is known to involve more than 50 proteins , which assemble transiently at sites on the plasma membrane ( for a review , see Robertson et al . , 2009 ) . Work in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae has led to significant advances in our understanding of the distinct stages that take place during endocytosis in vivo . It is now widely believed that the broad stages of coat assembly ( early ) , invagination ( mid ) and scission , followed by inward movement ( late ) are largely conserved across evolution , and that in many cases direct homologues of proteins are responsible for carrying out the same steps in the process . One notable difference between yeast and mammalian cells is that dynamins are considered to be central to the endocytic process in mammalian cells , whereas this family of proteins has been considered to be largely peripheral to endocytic function in yeast ( Gammie et al . , 1995 ; Yu and Cai , 2004 ) . Dynamin was originally isolated 20 years ago as a microtubule - binding protein ( Shpetner and Vallee , 1989 ) . A role in endocytosis was indicated from studies in Drosophila , when mutations in the shibire gene were seen to cause paralysis at an elevated temperature by reversibly blocking endocytosis at the nerve terminal ( Koenig and Ikeda , 1989 ) . Shibire was subsequently identified as Drosophila dynamin ( Chen et al . , 1991 ; Van Der Bliek and Meyerowitz , 1991 ) . Although mammalian dynamins have been shown to be crucial for endocytic function , their exact mechanism of function has remained the subject of debate ( Song and Schmid , 2003 ) . Furthermore , the presence of several mammalian dynamin genes ( DNM1 , DNM2 and DNM3 ) adds additional complexity . Although dynamin - 1 is thought to have a role solely in endocytosis , dynamin - 2 is considered to have a broader role possibly involving the trans - Golgi network , endosomes and podosomes , as well as endocytosis ( Cao et al . , 2003 ; Cao et al . , 2005 ; Ferguson et al . , 2009 ; Ochoa et al . , 2000 ) , whereas the role for dynamin - 3 is still largely unknown , although this protein has a more restricted tissue expression ( Kruchten and McNiven , 2006 ) . For several years , dynamin - 1 was proposed to act largely in a mechanical way to encircle the neck of invaginated endocytic vesicles facilitating scission of vesicles during endocytosis ( Hinshaw and Schmid , 1995 ) . Subsequently , a regulatory role was described , in which dynamin functions earlier through its GTPase domain as a molecular switch to regulate recruitment or activity of proteins within the endocytic complex ( Sever et al . , 1999 ) . Other studies have indicated that dynamin might function in both a regulatory and mechanical manner ( Narayanan et al . , 2005 ) . A recent study of dynamin - 1 - and dynamin - 2 - knockout cells suggests a predominant role for dynamin in scission rather than earlier events , and has also revealed the importance of amphiphysins and actin in mammalian endocytosis ( Ferguson et al . , 2009 ) . Yeast contains three dynamin homologues ( Vps1 , Dnm1 and Mgm1 ) , all of which contain the crucial N - terminal GTPase domain , a middle domain and a GTPase effector domain ( GED ) at the C - terminus , which has also been shown to function in oligomerisation . Similar to other dynamin - like proteins , Vps1 does not contain the PH domain , nor the C - terminal proline - rich domain , which is found in conventional dynamins ( Shin et al . , 1999 ; Vater A role for the dynamin - like protein Vps1 during endocytosis in yeast Iwona I .

Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd doi : 10 . 1242 / jcs . 070508 Summary Dynamins are a conserved family of proteins involved in membrane fusion and fission . Although mammalian dynamins are known to be involved in several membrane - trafficking events , the role of dynamin - 1 in endocytosis is the best - characterised role of this protein family . Despite many similarities between endocytosis in yeast and mammalian cells , a comparable role for dynamins in yeast has not previously been demonstrated . The reported lack of involvement of dynamins in yeast endocytosis has raised questions over the general applicability of the current yeast model of endocytosis , and has also precluded studies using well - developed methods in yeast , to further our understanding of the mechanism of dynamin function during endocytosis . Here , we investigate the yeast dynamin - like protein Vps1 and demonstrate a transient burst of localisation to sites of endocytosis . Using live - cell imaging of endocytic reporters in strains lacking vps1 , and also electron microscopy and biochemical approaches , we demonstrate a role for Vps1 in facilitating endocytic invagination . Vps1 mutants were generated , and analysis in several assays reveals a role for the C - terminal self - assembly domain in endocytosis but not in other membrane fission events with which Vps1 has previously been associated . Key words : Dynamin , Amphiphysin , Endocytosis , Rvs167 , Saccharomyces cerevisiae J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e JCS ePress online publication date 21 September 2010 et al . , 1992 ) . Vps1 is involved in several membrane fusion and fission events within the Golgi , vacuole , endosome and peroxisomal systems ( Hoepfner et al . , 2001 ; Kuravi et al . , 2006 ; Nothwehr et al . , 1995 ; Peters et al . , 2004 ; Vater et al . , 1992 ) , whereas Dnm1 and Mgm1 are thought to be involved in mitochondrial fusion and fission ( Cerveny et al . , 2007 ) . However , a role for Dnm1 in endosomal trafficking has also been reported ( Gammie et al . , 1995 ) . A role for Vps1 in early stages of endocytosis has been controversial and it is rarely listed as a protein involved in the yeast endocytic process . However , there is evidence that deletion of VPS1 affects the morphology of cortical actin patches and that it interacts with an endocytic adaptor protein Sla1 ( Yu and Cai , 2004 ) . It is possible that the role for dynamins in yeast endocytosis has been underestimated because of their involvement in other cell processes , and also the ability of cells to undergo endocytosis in their absence . In yeast , it is the amphiphysin proteins ( Rvs167 and Rvs161 ) that have been considered responsible for vesicle scission . Similarly to dynamins , amphiphysins have the ability to tubulate and fragment membranes in vitro ( Dawson et al . , 2006 ) . In addition to this mechanical role , the SH3 domain at the C - terminus of some amphiphysins ( including Rvs167 ) is likely to be important in recruiting and possibly activating other endocytic proteins . Deletion of RVS167 causes a reduction ( ~ 30 % ) in the number of successful vesicle scission events ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ) , indicating that the amphiphysins are important , but might not be the only proteins involved in this event . Results Vps1 colocalises with endocytic proteins Vps1 has a clearly demonstrated role in endosomal trafficking and in peroxisomal fission ( Hoepfner et al . , 2001 ; Nothwehr et al . , 1995 ; Vater et al . , 1992 ; Peters et al . , 2004 ; Rothlisberger et al . , 2009 ) . In this study , we aimed to determine whether this fusion – fission role also functions during endocytosis . A minimum requirement for a protein to a have a direct role in endocytosis is for it to show at least partial localisation to endocytic sites . In previous studies , Vps1 has been shown to localise to internal organelles , and this staining is predominant in cells expressing GFP - tagged Vps1 ( Peters et al . , 2004 ) . However , partial colocalisation with an endocytic adaptor protein Sla1 has also been reported ( Yu and Cai , 2004 ) . Expression of Vps1 - GFP from both high and low copy number plasmids leads to high levels of fluorescence on the internal membranes and in these cells , spots at the cell periphery are difficult to discern ( our unpublished observations ) . In this study , we have used a strain expressing Vps1 - GFP under its own promoter ( Peters et al . , 2004 ) . Vps1 - GFP was expressed , both as the sole source of Vps1 in a haploid cell , and also coexpressed with endogenous untagged Vps1 in a heterozygous diploid cell . In both strains , the behaviour of coexpressed RFP markers are apparently normal , and do not show the aberrant behaviours observed for the vps1 - deletion strain ( see below ) . To investigate colocalisation with endocytic markers , cells were generated that coexpress Vps1 - GFP and either Sla1 - mRFP ( a marker that is present throughout endocytic invagination ) or Abp1mRFP ( a marker of actin at the site ) . These strains were analysed using both wide - field epifluorescence microscopy and TIRF microscopy . As shown in Fig . 1A ( upper panels ) , Vps1GFP was found in several internal organelles , which are likely to be endosomes . It also colocalised with Abp1mRFP , demonstrating that Vps1 is present at endocytic sites . By TIRF microscopy , 3497 Yeast dynamin Vps1 functions in endocytosis Fig . 1 . Vps1 colocalises with endocytic proteins . ( A )  Vps1 - GFP and either Abp1 - mRFP ( upper ) or Sla1 - mRFP ( lower ) were coexpressed and cells imaged . Arrows depict merged spots . Scale bar : 2   m . ( B )  Vps1 - GFP was coexpressed with Abp1 - mRFP and intensity curves generated for eight separate endocytic spots . Weighted averages of spot intensity was calculated and plotted ( means ± s . d . ) . The accompanying images for one of these spots are shown below the graph . Sla1 - GFP was also expressed with Abp1 - mRFP and intensity curves generated to allow relative comparisons . The distance of the tip of the Abp1 spots from the membrane were plotted . ( C )  200   M Lat - A was added to cells coexpressing Vps1 - GFP with Abp1 - mRFP ( upper ) or Sla1 - mRFP ( lower ) . Scale bars : 2   m . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e colocalisation with the coat protein Sla1 - mRFP was also clear . However , colocalisation with both markers was only partial , suggesting that either only a subset of sites recruit Vps1 or that Vps1 is present only transiently at endocytic sites . To address this , the timing of Vps1 localisation was measured relative to the actin marker Abp1 . Intensity profiles of multiple spots were generated ( Fig . 1B ) . This approach revealed that Vps1 arrived about 5 – 6 seconds after Abp1 , at a time corresponding to onset of invagination ( Fig . 1B ) ( Liu et al . , 2009 ) . Vps1 then remained at the membrane and disassembled from the site before Abp1 . Vps1 lifetime at the membrane was 8 . 70±4 . 07 seconds ( mean ± s . d . ; n  75 patches ) . This lifetime was the same whether Vps1 - GFP was expressed as the sole form of Vps1 , or coexpressed with untagged endogenous Vps1 . The Vps1 lifetime corresponds to about half the lifetime of Abp1 at patches ( Abp1 lifetime ~ 18 seconds ) and about one third of the lifetime of Sla1 ( 25 – 30 seconds ) and can explain why only partial colocalisation with these endocytic markers was observed . A characteristic feature of many endocytic proteins is that their lifetime at the plasma membrane is increased in the presence of the actin - monomer - sequestering drug latrunculin A ( Lat - A ) ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ; Morton et al . , 2000 ; Toshima et al . , 2009 ) . Although actin - binding proteins are unable to assemble at the site , actin - independent components localise , and remain at sites for longer . Lat - A was added to cells expressing Vps1 - GFP and Abp1 - mRFP ( Fig . 1C , upper ) . As expected the Abp1 - mRFP localisation was lost from sites , although Vps1 remained localised , demonstrating that its localisation was actin - independent . In the presence of Lat - A , Vps1 still colocalised with Sla1 ( Fig . 1C , bottom ) and its lifetime in patches was increased to 33 . 1±18 . 5 seconds ( mean ± s . d . ; n  102 ) , which is a significant increase judged by an unpaired Student’s t - test ( P  0 . 0141 ) . This Lat - A - dependent increase in Vps1 3498 Journal of Cell Science 123 ( 20 ) lifetime at endocytic sites adds further support to the idea that Vps1 is a bona fide endocytic protein . In addition , we quantified the number of stabilised endocytic patches formed under Lat - A treatment , which contained both Sla1 and Vps1 . This gives an idea of the proportion of patches formed at the membrane that are able to recruit Vps1 . In the presence of Lat - A , 78 % of Sla1 - mRFP patches also colocalised Vps1 - GFP ( n  102 ) , supporting the idea that the majority of endocytic patches involve Vps1 function . Deletion of Vps1 confers defects on endocytic machinery Having established that Vps1 is in a position to function directly during endocytosis , we determined the effect that deletion of Vps1 has during single endocytic invagination events . The effect of VPS1 deletion on the lifetime and behaviour of several proteins was investigated : Ent1 and Sla2 , components of the endocytic coat complex ; Las17 , the yeast WASP homologue and activator of Arp2 / 3 mediated actin polymerisation ; Abp1 and Sac6 , components of the actin network that forms during invagination ; and Rvs167 , the amphiphysin proposed to be responsible for scission . As shown in Fig . 2A , lifetimes of five of the six proteins were markedly increased ( see also supplementary material Movies 1 and 2 ) . To examine the behaviour of patches in more detail , kymographs were generated which depict movement of a patch over its lifetime . The endocytic coat proteins Sla2 and Ent1 localised longer at the plasma membrane before moving inwards ( Fig . 2B ) . However , the movement inwards was often aberrant and patches could be seen to retract toward the plasma membrane ( Fig . 2B , arrows ) . The WASP homologue las17 usually remains at the plasma membrane throughout invagination . In the vps1 - deletion strain , movement in the plane of the membrane , as well as invagination and retraction could be observed . Normal and aberrant phenotypes were quantified Fig . 2 .

Aberrant endocytic events for Sla2 and Ent1 were defined as those showing no invagination , movement in the membrane plane , delayed scission or retraction . For Las17 , aberrant events were those showing movement in the membrane plane , inappropriate invagination and retraction . ( C )  FM4 - 64 internalisation was performed as described . Total internal cell fluorescence intensity ( mean ± s . d . ) was measured at each time point . ( D )  Representative images of wild - type and vps1 (cid:2) cells from three time points in the FM4 - 64 - uptake assay . Arrows indicate foci of FM4 - 64 staining on the plasma membrane . Scale bars : 2   m . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e to determine the extent of the defect . Patches were analysed and classified according to their ability to invaginate and undergo scission normally . Deletion of vps1 resulted in a severe disruption of these endocytic events ( Fig . 2B ) . Having shown that vps1 deletion caused aberrant behaviour at the level of a single endocytic patch , we investigated the effect of vps1 deletion in the whole cell . Although some studies have indicated no internalisation defects in cells lacking vps1 expression ( Geli and Riezman , 1998 ) , others have demonstrated effects of vps1 deletion on uptake of uracil permease ( Fur4 ) activity ( Yu and Cai , 2004 ) . Deletion of many genes encoding proteins with accepted roles in endocytosis , such as Cap1 , Scp1 , Abp1 , are reported to have no defect in several assays ( Gheorghe et al . , 2008 ; Huang et al . , 1999 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ; Maldonado - Baez et al . , 2008 ) . However , the assays are often performed on fixed cells or over long time courses that do not detect more subtle , kinetic changes in uptake . To circumvent these issues , uptake of the lipophylic dye FM4 - 64 was performed under continuous observation following addition of dye to cells . Images were recorded over 15 minutes and total internal fluorescence intensity was measured ( Fig . 2C ) . The plasma membrane was the first structure to be labelled following addition of FM4 - 64 ( Fig . 2D ) . Foci of dye could then be seen in the plane of the plasma membrane before internal staining was observed ( arrows ) . In wild - type cells , FM4 - 64 was seen next in endosomes and vacuoles . In vps1 (cid:2) cells , although plasma membrane staining occurred on the same time scale ( 1 – 2 minutes ) , the time for foci to form was slower . When the foci formed they persisted longer and there was a marked reduction in the rate at which internal fluorescence was observed . As expected from previous studies , the subsequent entry of FM4 - 64 to endosomes and the vacuoles was also delayed . Thus , vps1 deletion affects internalisation of a bulk lipid marker , and the behaviour of single endocytic patches . 3499 Yeast dynamin Vps1 functions in endocytosis Overlapping roles of Vps1 and amphiphysin The exception to the increased patch lifetime in vps1 (cid:2) cells ( Fig . 2A ) was the lifetime for the amphiphysin Rvs167 . Furthermore , the retraction behaviour observed in kymographs for the various endocytic proteins ( Fig . 2B ) was reminiscent of the behaviour noted for rvs167 (cid:2) cells ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ) . These data suggest that the function of Vps1 could be linked to , or overlap with , that of amphiphysins , as has been suggested from studies in mammalian cells ( Ferguson et al . , 2009 ; Itoh et al . , 2005 ; Yamada et al . , 2009 ) . To investigate possible interplay between Vps1 and Rvs167 , single deletion strains were crossed to determine any genetic interaction . Each deletion caused a slight temperature - sensitive growth phenotype ( Fig . 3A ) . However , when combined , the mutations had a synergistic effect , and cells did not grow at 37°C . Such a phenotype is often suggested to indicate an overlapping role within a process ( Tong et al . , 2001 ) . Imaging of cells expressing Rvs167 - GFP revealed an effect of vps1 deletion on Rvs167 - GFP localisation . In wild - type cells , Rvs167 - GFP showed robust localisation to endocytic sites , whereas in vps1 (cid:2) cells , Rvs167 localised to endocytic sites , but its intensity was reduced ( Fig . 3B ) . This effect was quantified by measuring fluorescence intensities of patches and cytoplasm in wild - type and vps1 (cid:2) cells . The intensity of patches was reduced by more than 50 % in the mutant ( P < 0 . 0001 , unpaired Student’s t - test ) . In these strains , the overall level of Rvs167 - GFP as determined by western blotting appeared to be similar , indicating that the reduced level of intensity is not due to degradation ( data not shown ) . To determine whether Vps1 is involved in recruitment or stability of Rvs167 at the membrane Vps1 - GFP and Rvs167 - mRFP were coexpressed and localised . As shown in Fig . 3D , no time difference in localisation at the patch could be distinguished , indicating that Vps1 is more likely to be involved in stabilising Rvs167 at the endocytic site . The observation that the lifetimes of both tagged Fig . 3 . The effect of vps1 deletion on the amphiphysin Rvs167 .

J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e proteins are reduced when coexpressed , further suggests that the presence of two bulky fluorophores compromises their close interactions within the patch . To investigate the effect of deletion of rvs167 and vps1 on endocytosis , kymographs were generated in strains expressing the actin marker Sac6 - RFP ( Fig . 3E ) . This marker usually has a short lifetime with a sharp inward movement 1 – 2 seconds after arrival at the plasma membrane , followed by disassembly after scission . Defects were observed in all mutant strains , but those in the double mutant were most prevalent . Because retraction events have been quantified previously for cells lacking rvs167 , we sought to compare this specific phenotype . Retraction events were defined as an endocytic event in which inward movement has taken place but in which scission does not occur and movement back towards the membrane is observed . As shown in Fig . 3C , retraction was seen in 31 % of rvs167 (cid:2) endocytic events , which is similar to previously reported results ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ) ; in 39 % of events in vps1 (cid:2) cells and in 59 % of events in rvs167 (cid:2) vps1 (cid:2) cells . Invaginations do not form correctly in the absence of vps1 To investigate the function of Vps1 during invagination in more detail , an ultrastructural analysis using electron microscopy was performed . In this analysis , three main types of invagination at the plasma membrane were identified . These were defined as shallow ( depth < 40 nm ) with the neck of the opening wide compared with the tubule diameter ; pronounced ( 40 – 60 nm ) when the neck of the tubule was the same or only slightly wider than the tubule diameter ; deep ( > 60 nm ) , with the tubule neck about the same as the tubule diameter . In wild - type cells , 38 % of invaginations fell in the pronounced category ( Fig . 4A ) . Interestingly , in vps1 (cid:2) cells , the number of pronounced invaginations was significantly reduced to 24 % ( n  151 invaginations for wt and 91 for vps1 (cid:2) ) . During the analysis , it was noted that in wild - type cells , the majority of invaginations occurred perpendicular to the membrane whereas in vps1 (cid:2) cells , invaginations were often bent in appearance and the angle of invagination deviated from the perpendicular ( Fig . 4B ) . This observation was quantified by measuring the angle of deviation of invaginations from a line drawn perpendicular to the membrane . As shown in Fig . 4C , there was a significant increase in the angle of invagination in the absence of vps1 . The mean angle score for the wild type ( 8 . 93±9 . 24 ; mean ± s . d . , n  54 ) was significantly lower than that in vps1 (cid:2) cells ( 18 . 55±12 . 66 , n  54 ; P  0 . 0000169 ) . These data suggest that Vps1 functions to facilitate directed invagination leading to effective scission . This is supported by a model in which Vps1 forms a collar structure at the neck of an invaginating tubule in an analogous manner to dynamin in mammalian cells or in shibire mutant cells ( Koenig and Ikeda , 1989 ) . In this regard , a repeat structure can be detected on some of the deep invaginations seen in wild - type cells ( Fig . 4D ) , but not in any deep or pronounced pits in vps1 (cid:2) cells . Vps1 mutations reveal defects in endocytosis and endosomal trafficking Previous work has shown a function for the N - terminal GTPase domain of Vps1 in intracellular membrane - trafficking events , but the role of its C - terminal domain has not been addressed . The mutants generated are depicted in Fig . 5A and were based on mutations in dynamin - 1 . Sequence alignment of dynamin - 1 and Vps1 is shown in supplementary material Fig S1 . The mutations have been reported to influence the GTPase activity , self assembly or other aspects of dynamin - 1 function ( Damke et al . , 1994 ; 3500 Journal of Cell Science 123 ( 20 ) Herskovits et al . , 1993 ; Sever et al . , 1999 ; Song et al . , 2004a ; Song et al . , 2004b ; Vater et al . , 1992 ; Yu and Cai , 2004 ) . Mutations , corresponding positions in human dynamin - 1 and temperature sensitivity of the vps1 (cid:2) cells transformed with plasmids carrying the mutations are listed in Table 1 . The first analysis of the mutants used a recently published assay for endocytic recycling , in which a reporter construct , containing the SNARE protein Snc1 fused to both an invertase activity at its N - terminus and GFP at its C - terminus , is transformed into vps1 (cid:2) cells ( Burston et al . , 2009 ) . This assay allows differentiation between endosomal trafficking and endocytic internalisation defects . If Vps1 function is predominantly intracellular , for example Fig . 4 .

If the primary function of the protein is in endocytic internalisation , then uptake of the SNARE will be delayed , more invertase will be exposed at the surface and in the assay colonies will appear dark brown . In wild - type cells , there was continuous cycling of Snc1 , and the cells appeared light brown when assayed . Cells in which vps1 was deleted were transformed with an empty plasmid or with plasmids carrying wild - type or mutant vps1 . In the assay , there was a clear outcome , with vps1 (cid:2) colonies remaining largely white ( Fig . 5B ) . Those cells expressing wild - type VPS1 restored trafficking , such that the expected light - brown colouring was observed . The mutants fell into three classes . Those that lie in the N - terminal half caused a phenotype that was similar to vps1 (cid:2) , indicating the importance of the GTPase function in endosomal trafficking or recycling . Most of the mutants in the C - terminal domain were similar to the wild type , suggesting that C - terminal functions are less important for endosomal recycling . However , the mutant I649K was darker than the wild type , indicating a more predominant endocytic phenotype . 3501 Yeast dynamin Vps1 functions in endocytosis Two mutants were analysed further . These were the mutants T63A ( representative of GTPase function ) and I649K ( from the GTPase effector or self - assembly domain ) . Three assays were used to report on the functional contribution of the N - and C - terminal domains in intracellular trafficking events . First , the localisation of the GFP fusion in the invertase – Snc1 reporter was examined in wild - type and mutant strains ( Fig . 5C ; n  100 cells for plasma membrane staining counts ) . In wild - type cells , or cells in which VPS1 was re - expressed in the null strain , GFP localised to the plasma membrane in 93 % of cells and to large internal organelles ( probably endosomes ) but there was relatively little background signal from small vesicles . In vps1 (cid:2) cells , the majority of GFP appeared to localise to small vesicles with less in larger organelles and only 13 % of cells had plasma membrane staining , indicating an endosomal trafficking defect . Expression of the T63A GTPase mutant was similar to the null phenotype , with predominantly small vesicles and a few endosomes ( 8 % cells had plasma membrane staining ) . The mutant in the C - terminal region ( I649K ) had a predominantly plasma membrane and endosomal localisation ( 87 % cells had plasma membrane staining ) . Therefore , the GTPase domain is crucial for endosomal recycling . Fig . 5 . Analysis of the endosome , vacuole and peroxisome in Vps1 mutants . ( A )  Mutations were generated in Vps1 as depicted . ( B )  Cells deleted for vps1 were transformed with a construct expressing the recycling SNARE protein Snc1 , fused to SUC2 and GFP . Localisation of invertase is detected in a colorimetric assay . ( C )  Localisation of GFP - Snc1 - SUC2 construct was analysed in wild - type , vps1 (cid:2) , T63A and I649K mutants . Scale bars : 2   m . ( D ) Uptake of FM4 - 64 reveals vacuolar trafficking defects in a subset of vps1 mutant strains . Cells were incubated for 10 minutes with FM4 - 64 , washed and then visualised after 90 minutes . Arrows indicate clusters of endosomes or fragmented vacuoles surrounding a large weakly stained vacuole , the class F phenotype . Scale bars : 10   m . ( E ) Peroxisomes labelled with GFP peroxisome reporter were visualised in a vps1 (cid:2) dnm1 (cid:2) strain expressing plasmids with mutant versions of vps1 . Images are compressed Z - stacks for fission - proficient strains and in a single plane for fission - deficient strains . Scale bar : 5   m . ( F )  Whole - cell extracts separated by SDS – PAGE . The upper part of gel was used for western blotting with mouse anti - Vps1 polyclonal antibody . The lower half of the gel was removed and stained with Coomassie Blue to indicate protein - loading levels . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e Defects in trafficking to the vacuole were also shown by FM4 - 64 staining ( Fig . 5D ) . vps1 (cid:2) cells have been classed as class F vacuolar mutants and they have a rather heterogeneous phenotype , with both fragmented vacuoles and vacuoles with aberrant morphologies ( Raymond et al . , 1992 ) . A common feature of these cells is a weakly stained vacuole with clusters of vacuoles around it . In cells expressing VPS1 , uptake of FM4 - 64 showed clear localisation to vacuolar membranes ( Fig . 5D ) . In vps1 (cid:2) , there was a lower level of vacuolar localisation and a high level of staining , especially of clustered endosomes around the vacuole ( Fig . 5D , arrows ) . The GTPase - domain mutant T63A was phenotypically similar to the vps1 (cid:2) strain . The C - terminal mutation I649K showed clear vacuolar membrane staining that was similar to the wild type , indicating relatively normal trafficking . Finally , we addressed whether the Vps1 mutants would rescue the characteristic phenotype of peroxisomes in vps1 (cid:2) dnm1 (cid:2) cells in which only one large peroxisome is observed when using a peroxisomal reporter GFP ( Motley and Hettema , 2007 ) . In support of the idea that the GTPase activity functions to drive membrane fusion – fission reactions , the mutant affecting this part of the protein was also defective in peroxisomal fission . Again , the I649K mutant in the C - terminal region of the protein was able to rescue the peroxisome defect and restore the normal number of peroxisomes in cells ( Fig . 5E ) . To verify that the effects observed in the assays were not due to absence of protein as a result of instability and degradation , protein extracts were made from wild - type cells and from vps1 (cid:2) cells carrying VPS1 , T63A , I649K and empty plasmids . The level of Vps1 protein expressed was comparable in all strains , apart from the null ( Fig . 5F ) . Overall , these data demonstrate the importance of the GTPase domain in known Vps1 functions in endosomal and vacuolar trafficking and peroxisome morphology . By contrast , the I649K C - terminal mutation conferred an endocytic phenotype in the invertase assay , but mutants were similar to the wild type for peroxisomal and vacuolar - trafficking assays . To investigate the endocytic phenotype further , the behaviour of key endocytic proteins was analysed in the T63A and I649K Vps1 mutants and compared with that in wild - type and vps1 (cid:2) cells . When these vps1 mutants were expressed in Las17 - GFP cells , they showed a lifetime that was not statistically different from the vps1 - null strain ( Fig . 6A , supplementary material Movie 1 ) , suggesting that during endocytosis , both N - and C - terminal domains are necessary for function . Kymographs also showed the increase in lifetime . Furthermore , although the majority of patches simply showed an increase in the time spent in the plane of the plasma membrane , a small proportion of patches ( ≤ 20 % ) in vps1 (cid:2) cells expressing either an empty plasmid or mutant plasmids , showed aberrant inward movements ( Fig . 6B ) . Analysis of Sla2GFP patch lifetimes also revealed defects in the Vps1 mutant lifetimes and behaviour , although interestingly , none of the mutants had a lifetime defect as severe as that in the null ( Fig . 6C ) . Again , there were no significant differences in lifetimes between Vps1 T63A and I649K mutants . Kymographs and movies show that both mutants had aberrant invaginations and retractions ( Fig . 6D ; supplementary material Movie 2 ) . Finally , the effect of Vps1 mutation on Rvs167 behaviour was investigated . Re - expression of wild - type VPS1 fully rescued the shortened lifetime of Rvs167 in the vps1 - null strain ( Fig . 6E , F ) . In addition , both T63A and I649K mutants showed weaker localisation to the patches and reduced patch lifetimes , similar to the null strain . 3502 Journal of Cell Science 123 ( 20 ) Wild - type Vps1 tubulates membranes in vitro The electron microscopy data suggested that Vps1 acts to facilitate the shallow - to - pronounced invagination structure in vivo and / or to ensure directed inward growth of the invaginating tubule . We then aimed to determine whether purified Vps1 has the capacity to bind to and possibly tubulate membranes in vitro . This would add support to the idea of Vps1 performing this key role directly in vivo , rather than through recruitment of other activities . Vps1 was purified as described , and incubated with liposomes ( + GTP ) . Binding to liposomes was assessed by centrifugation of membranes . As shown in Fig . 7A , Vps1 pelleted in the presence of liposomes ( upper panel ) , but not in their absence ( lower panel ) , Fig . 6 . Vps1 mutants show defects in the behaviour of endocytic proteins . ( A )  Lifetime of Las17 - GFP was measured in wild - type and vps1 (cid:2) cells , and in vps1 (cid:2) strains transformed with plasmids ( empty , VPS1 , vps1T63A and Vps1I649K ) . n  119 , 121 , 24 , 34 , 41 , 25 , respectively .

Error bars indicate s . d . All mutants are significantly different from wild type ( * * * P < 0 . 0001 ) . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e demonstrating the ability of Vps1 to bind liposomes . Next , the effect on liposome structure was investigated . Vps1 was incubated with liposomes and GTP  s and applied to EM grids . As shown in Fig . 7B , the presence of Vps1 had a marked effect on liposome structure , with tubules decorated with Vps1 clearly visible after incubation . These tubules were also formed at a ten - times lower concentration of Vps1 ( supplementary material Fig . S2 ) . Finally , we addressed whether self - assembly of Vps1 has a role in its ability to tubulate membranes . The mutation I649K corresponds to the I690K mutation in human dynamin and this mutation has been shown to affect oligomerisation of dynamin ( Song et al . , 2004b ) . I649K Vps1 was purified , and tested for its ability to oligomerise in the presence of GTP  s in a centrifugation - based assay . In contrast to the lipid - binding assay , which was performed in the presence of GTP , use of GTP  s stabilises self assembly of Vps1 . Fig . 7C shows that although Vps1 could self assemble , allowing it to pellet under the conditions described , I649K Vps1 did not pellet , confirming the oligomerisation defect in this mutant . Mutant Vps1 was , however , able to bind liposomes ( Fig . 7A ) . Analysis by EM reveals that Vps1 I649K did not tubulate membranes ( Fig . 7B ) , demonstrating the importance of self - assembly in the tubulation process . EM analysis of wild - type Vps1 in the presence of GTP  s but without liposomes showed no tubules ( supplementary material Fig . S2 ) , confirming that tubules are liposome dependent . Discussion Dynamin is considered to be a central protein in endocytosis in metazoan cells , and the absence of this role in yeast has raised many questions ( see Ferguson et al . , 2009 ; Geli and Riezman , 1998 ; Robertson et al . , 2009 ) . Here , we present data that we believe strongly support a role for the dynamin - like protein Vps1 in the endocytic process in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Additional evidence for Vps1 function in endocytosis has also been recently reported by Nannapaneni and colleagues ( Nannapaneni et al . , 2010 ) . Given our findings , it seems somewhat surprising that such an endocytic defect was not previously reported . We think that there are several reasons for this , including the promiscuous nature of Vps1 function in several other membrane - trafficking steps and also because deletion of vps1 does not show obvious defects in uptake of commonly used reporters such as Lucifer Yellow ( Geli and Riezman , 1998 ) . Lack of clear defects in these classical endocytic assays is not , however , uncommon , with deletion of many endocytic genes causing no apparent defects . In terms of a role for Vps1 in endocytosis , critically , we show the Vps1 colocalises with other endocytic proteins ( Fig . 1A ) , and second that the vps1 deletion strain has clear defects in behaviour of endocytic reporter proteins and a kinetic defect in uptake of the dye FM4 - 64 ( Fig . 2 ) . Three questions were then addressed : ( 1 ) When does Vps1 function during endocytosis ? ( 2 ) How does it function ? ( 3 ) What are the roles of its N - and C - terminal domains in this function ? To ascertain when Vps1 functions during endocytosis , the cortical lifetime of Vps1 was measured and found to be 8 . 7 seconds . This is short compared with many other endocytic proteins such as Sla1 ( ~ 25 – 30 seconds and Abp1 ~ 15 – 18 seconds ) , but more similar to timing of Myo3 and Myo5 ( ~ 10 – 12 seconds ) , the actin - binding protein Sac6 ( 10 – 12 seconds ) and the amphiphysins ( ~ 9 – 10 seconds ) ( Gheorghe et al . , 2008 ; Jonsdottir and Li , 2004 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ) . Timing of its arrival at the membrane , about 5 seconds after Abp1 , indicate that it is not 3503 Yeast dynamin Vps1 functions in endocytosis functioning in recruitment of endocytic coat or early acting F - actin polymerisation factors and most likely has a role at the onset or during the invagination step of endocytosis . This appears to be , at least qualitatively , similar to the situation in Swiss - 3T3 cells in which dynamin fluorescence increased sharply and transiently at clathrin - labelled spots just before inward movement ( Merrifield et al . , 2002 ) . The question of the mechanism of function then arises . The behaviour of several endocytic proteins was studied in vps1 (cid:2) cells . Of these , one had a reduced level of localisation and a shorter lifetime in patches ( Figs 2 , 3 ) . This was the amphiphysin protein Rvs167 . However , in colocalisation studies , we were not able to distinguish arrival times to patches , indicating that Vps1 is more likely to maintain Rvs167 at the membrane rather than Fig . 7 . Vps1 binds and tubulates liposomes . ( A )  Vps1 was incubated with liposomes , which were then subjected to centrifugation and total protein ( t ) , pellets ( p ) and supernatants ( s ) were analysed by SDS – PAGE . Varying concentrations of wtVps1 , or 4   M I649K Vps1 were used in the presence ( top panel ) or absence ( bottom panel ) of liposomes . ( B )  Liposomes were analysed using electron microscopy in the presence and absence of wt Vps1 or I649K Vps1 . A high - resolution image of a tubulated liposome reveals a regular organisation of negative staining along the formed tubule . ( C )  Self - assembly assays of wt Vps1 and I649K Vps1 were performed as described . s , supernatant ; p , pellet fractions . J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 3504 Journal of Cell Science 123 ( 20 ) recruit it ( Fig . 3D ) . There is currently no evidence that Vps1 interacts directly with Rvs167 . However , there are clear links between the proteins . One candidate for linking Vps1 and Rvs167 function is Sla1 , which has reported interactions with both proteins ( Stamenova et al . , 2004 ; Yu and Cai , 2004 ) . Alternatively , Vps1 might induce changes to the membrane itself that favour stable binding of Rvs167 . From the ultrastructural analysis ( Fig . 4 ) , one potential role for Vps1 is in the switch from a shallow wide - necked pit to a parallel - sided invaginating tubule . The in vitro data ( Fig . 7 ) also demonstrated that Vps1 has the capacity to bind to liposomes and to tubulate them . Taken together , we suggest a model in which Vps1 is recruited to membranes in an actin - independent manner , but after F - actin polymerisation has been initiated . As rapid actin polymerisation drives inward membrane growth , Vps1 potentially in concert with Rvs167 , could bind to the membrane and form an oligomerised structure to bring the sides of the tubule essentially parallel . This action would ensure that the force from actin polymerisation is driving directly into the cell around the tubule . If a parallel - sided tubule is not formed , directed inward movement would be less likely , explaining why angles of invagination are more varied in the vps1 (cid:2) strain . Such disorganised forces might also be expected to cause the more erratic patch behaviour that is observed . The idea of a sheath of protein along the invaginated tubule region had been suggested in endocytic modelling studies ( Liu et al . , 2009 ) . This protein sheath is proposed to act as a filter to effect a separation of lipid species and thus generate lipid phase boundary forces , which , in concert with the force from actin polymerisation , could be responsible for membrane scission . Liu and colleagues propose that this sheath is entirely composed of amphiphysin ( Liu et al . , 2009 ) . Our data suggest that it could be initiated or maintained by the function of Vps1 . Finally , the role of distinct domains within Vps1 was investigated . Ten mutant forms of Vps1 were generated and expressed . The sites and amino acid changes made were based on mutations previously generated in mammalian dynamin or from the original Drosophila shibire mutations . The effects of two of these mutations T63A and I649K , which correspond to dominant - negative mutations in mammalian cells , were investigated . Taken together , the data indicate that the N - terminal GTPase domain of Vps1 is crucial for its function in endosomal recycling , vacuolar uptake of FM4 - 64 and in peroxisomal fission . Interestingly , mutations in the C - terminal domain did not compromise the function of Vps1 in these assays . The effect of Vps1 mutations in endocytosis was , however , markedly different . Not only does the GTPase domain have an important role in successful invagination , but the C - terminal region is also involved . For all endocytic markers studied , the I649K mutation in the C - terminal region caused effects as severe as those in the GTPase region . Biochemical studies ( Fig . 7 ) reveal that I649K mutation in the C - terminal domain of Vps1 prevents self - assembly . Thus , self - assembly is important for endocytic function of Vps1 , but does not appear to be required for the other trafficking roles investigated . This is a key result that defines the role of the yeast dynamin during endocytosis compared with its other roles in cell - membrane trafficking . Materials and Methods Materials Unless stated otherwise , chemicals were obtained from Sigma . Media were from Melford Laboratories ( Ipswich , Suffolk , UK ) ( yeast extract , peptone , agar ) or Sigma ( minimal synthetic medium and amino acids ) . Lat - A and FM4 - 64 were from Molecular Probes . Yeast strains and cell growth Yeast strains used in this study are listed in supplementary material Table S1 . Vps1 was deleted with a PCR - based recombination approach ( Longtine et al . , 1998 ) using a Candida glabrata LEU2 marker . Deletion was verified by colony PCR . pHB4 was integrated into the vps1 (cid:2) strain ( KAY1095 ) to generated a strain expressing the reporter GFP - SNC1 - SUC2 . All strains carrying GFP or mRFP tags have growth properties that are similar to control strains when expressed singly . The combination of Vps1 - GFP and Rvs167 - mRFP appears to cause some instability and both have reduced patch lifetimes . Vps1 - GFP was a gift from Andreas Mayer ( University of Lausanne , Lausanne , Switzerland ) and was previously characterised ( Peters et al . , 2004 ) . Cells were grown with rotary shaking at 30°C in liquid YPD medium ( 1 % yeast extract , 2 % Bacto - peptone , 2 % glucose supplemented with 40  g / ml adenine ) or in synthetic medium ( 0 . 67 % yeast nitrogen base , 2 % glucose ) with supplements . Transformations were performed using lithium acetate as described ( Kaiser et al . , 1994 ) . The plate - based invertase assay was performed as described ( Burston et al . , 2009 ) . Generation of Vps1 plasmid and mutations Plasmids used in this study are listed in supplementary material Table S2 . Sequence encoding VPS1 and 320 bp upstream was cloned from genomic DNA and cloned into a plasmid pEH318 marked with URA3 to generate plasmid pKA677 . Mutations were generated using site - directed mutagenesis kits ( Stratagene ) . Mutations generated are listed in Table 1 . All constructs were verified by sequencing . The mutation F585L arose spontaneously in the PCR process and this mutation was included for analysis alongside the others . Vps1 purification Vps1 cloned in pCRT7 / Nt - TOPO was a gift from Andreas Mayer ( University of Lausanne , Lausanne , Switzerland ) . His - tagged Vps1 was expressed in C43 cells [ Lucigen Overexpress TM C43 ( DE3 ) SOLOs ] by induction with 1 mM IPTG for 7 hours at 37°C . Pelleted cells from 2 litres of culture were resuspended in buffer ( 30 mM imidazole , 10 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 10 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 500 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 4 ) , and the protein was purified using HisTrap HP nickel columns ( GE Healthcare ) . Vps1 was concentrated and buffer exchanged in a centrifugal filter device ( Centriprep , Millipore ) into PBS . Approximately 2 mg protein was obtained from 2 litres of cell culture . I649K protein was expressed in C43 cells and induced at room temperature for 48 hours before being harvested and purified as for wild - type Vps1 . Liposome preparation For preparation of liposomes , 11  l of a 25 mg / ml solution of Folch fraction 1 ( Sigma ) was dried under nitrogen , then resuspended in 200  l buffer B ( 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 2 , 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT ) at 60°C for 30 minutes with gentle agitation . Liposomes were extruded 11 times through polycarbonate filters with 1 . 0  m pores . Self - assembly assays were carried out using an adapted method ( Yoon et al . , 2001 ) . Vps1 was added to liposome buffer at the concentrations shown and centrifuged at 313 , 000 g for 15 minutes to remove any aggregated protein . GTP  S was added to 0 . 5 mM , and oligomerised protein was pelleted by centrifugation at 250 , 000 g for 15 minutes ; supernatants and pellets were analysed by SDS – PAGE . Vps1 ( pre - spun at 313 , 000 g for 15 minutes ) was mixed with 20  l liposomes in the presence of 2 mM GTP , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM MgCl 2 and 2 mM DTT , and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes to measure liposome binding . Liposomes and bound protein was pelleted by centrifugation at 250 , 000 g for 15 minutes , and samples analysed by SDS – PAGE . Vps1 ( 12 . 5  M ) was mixed with liposomes ( 0 . 5 mg / ml ) and GTP  S ( 0 . 5 mM ) and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature to measure in vitro liposome tubulation . GTP  S was not essential , but enhanced self - assembly . The resulting mixture was then processed for electron microscopy . Electron microscopy In vitro tubulation was visualised by negative staining . Samples were adsorbed on glow - discharged carbon - coated copper grids and stained with 0 . 75 % uranyl formate . Electron micrographs were recorded on a Philips CM100 electron microscope using a Gatan MultiScan 794 CCD camera . Fluorescence microscopy Epifluorescence microscopy was performed using either of the following two systems : Olympus IX - 81 inverted microscope with a DeltaVision RT Restoration Microscopy System using a 100 (cid:3) / 1 . 40 NA oil objective , Photometrics Coolsnap HQ camera with Imaging and Image capture performed using SoftWoRx TM image analysis and model - building application ( Applied Precision Instruments , Seattle ) ; or , with an Olympus IX - 81 inverted microscope using MAG Biosystems acquisition software version 7 . 5 . 2 . 0 ( by Metamorph ) with a Photometrics CoolsnapHQ 2 Turbo 1394 camera . 3D deconvolution was carried out with Autoquant X AutoDeblur Gold WF version X2 . 1 . 3 . Post - acquisition image viewing , analysis and optimisation was carried out using Image - Pro Analyser version 6 . 3 ( both by Media Cybernetics ) . A 150 (cid:3) / 1 . 45 oil objective was used for acquiring time - lapse images and a 60 (cid:3) / 1 . 25 oil objective for FM4 - 64 experiments . All experiments were carried out at room temperature ( 22°C ) . TIRF microscopy was performed on an inverted Laser TIRF3 Imaging system ( Carl Zeiss ) with excitation lasers set to 488 nm and 561 nm to J ou r na l o f C e ll S c i en c e 3505 Yeast dynamin Vps1 functions in endocytosis visualise GFP - and mRFP - tagged proteins . Acquisition was performed using an alpha plan - Apochromat 100 (cid:3) / 1 . 46 NA oil objective and PVCAM camera . Imaging and Image capture was performed using AxioVision Rel 4 . 7 software at 20°C . For analysis of Vps1 - GFP colocalisation at patches with Abp1mRFP , only fully overlapping profiles were considered ( as shown in supplementary material Fig . S3 ) . This was done to avoid consideration of endosomally localised Vps1 , which can localise in spots close to endocytic patches . For uptake of FM4 - 64 ( Fig . 2 ) , 40  l of log - phase cells were pipetted into a well of a  - slide VI - flat slide ( IBIDI ) . 40  l of 32  M FM4 - 64 ( Invitrogen ) were added to the well corresponding to the same channel and cells were visualised at 591 nm ( Texas Red filter ) . Images were taken for 25 minutes at 10 second intervals . Analysis of intensity / unit area was carried out using Image - Pro Analyser ( version 6 . 3 . 0 . 512 ) . For uptake of FM4 - 64 ( Fig . 5 ) ; 0 . 25  l of 16 mM FM4 - 64 was added to 500  l culture for 10 minutes . Cells were washed and were viewed after 90 minutes . Peroxisomes were labelled with the peroxisome lumenal marker GFP - PTS1 , a GFP fusion to a peroxisome targeting signal type I under control of the Tpi1 promoter and visualised and imaged as previously described ( Motley and Hettema , 2007 ) . For live - cell imaging , cells expressing tagged proteins were visualised after growing to early log phase in synthetic medium with appropriate supplements . 2 . 8  l of culture grown in synthetic medium was applied to an uncoated slide and covered before inverting for imaging . Unless stated otherwise , time - lapse live - cell imaging of GFP - tagged proteins was performed with 1 second time lapse . All image data sets were deconvolved , the distance of moving fluorescence spots were measured , and the arbitrary profile of intensity values , image coordinates and tracking of patch movements were established using the SoftWoRx application . Images were exported as TIFF files and image size adjusted to 300 d . p . i . and assembled using Adobe Photoshop CS2 . Kymographs were assembled using ImageJ software . Statistical analysis of lifetimes was performed using Graphpad Prism software . Preparation of yeast for electron microscopy 50 ml of mid log phase yeast growing in YPD medium ( 1 % yeast extract , 2 % peptone , 2 % dextrose ) was concentrated by syringe filtering , transferred to a Leica flat specimen carrier and frozen in a Leica EMPACT high pressure freezer . Freeze substitution and fixation were carried out in a Leica AFS freeze substitution unit . Frozen specimens were transferred into fixative ( 0 . 1 % uranyl acetate , 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde , 5 % H 2 O in acetone ) at – 90°C for 48 hours , then warmed to – 25°C for 12 hours , followed by three 15 - minute washes in pure acetone at – 25°C . They were infiltrated with 1 : 2 mix of Lowicryl HM 20 ( Polysciences ) : acetone for 1 hour at – 25°C , 1 : 1 Lowicryl : acetone for 1 hour at – 25°C , 2 : 1 Lowicryl : acetone for 1 hour at – 25°C and 100 % Lowicryl overnight at – 25°C . Samples were placed in fresh 100 % Lowicryl at – 25°C and polymerised with the UV lamp for 48 hours , warmed up to + 25°C over 10 hours and incubated for 24 hours with the UV lamp . 20 - to 60 - nm - thick sections were cut using a Diatome Ultrasonic diamond knife on a Leica EM UC6 ultramicrotome ( Leica Microsystems ) , stained with 1 % aqueous uranyl acetate for 10 minutes , washed 20 times with water and stained with Reynold’s lead citrate for 10 minutes , washed again and air dried . They were viewed at 100 kV in a Hitachi H7600 TEM .
