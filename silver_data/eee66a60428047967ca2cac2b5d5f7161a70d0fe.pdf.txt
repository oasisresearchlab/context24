Wasik 1 , Manuel Thery 3 , Alexander R . Dunn 2 and Reinhard Fässler 1 , 4 Integrin - based adhesions play critical roles in cell migration . Talin activates integrins and ﬂexibly connects integrins to the actomyosin cytoskeleton , thereby serving as a ‘molecular clutch’ that transmits forces to the extracellular matrix to drive cell migration . Here we identify the evolutionarily conserved Kank protein family as novel components of focal adhesions ( FAs ) . Kank proteins accumulate at the lateral border of FAs , which we term the FA belt , and in central sliding adhesions , where they directly bind the talin rod domain through the Kank amino - terminal ( KN ) motif and induce talin and integrin activation . In addition , Kank proteins diminish the talin – actomyosin linkage , which curbs force transmission across integrins , leading to reduced integrin – ligand bond strength , slippage between integrin and ligand , central adhesion formation and sliding , and reduced cell migration speed . Our data identify Kank proteins as talin activators that decrease the grip between the integrin – talin complex and actomyosin to regulate cell migration velocity . Mesenchymal cell migration on the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) is crucial for embryonic development , wound healing and tumour metastasis . It commences with the formation of a lamellipodium at the cell leading edge , which is stabilized by numerous small and short - lived integrin - containing nascent adhesions ( NAs ) 1 . As cells migrate , a few NAs mature into larger focal adhesions ( FAs ) in the lamella , which associate with the actomyosin cytoskeleton and apply traction forces against the ECM necessary to move the cell forward 2 . Integrins are core components of cell – matrix adhesion sites . They are α / β heterodimers that undergo a conformational change before they bind ligands ( termed integrin activation ) , cluster and recruit numerous proteins to their cytoplasmic domains . A hallmark of integrin - mediated adhesion is that the lifetime of integrin – ligand bonds can be flexibly increased when forces are applied to integrins 3 . This property , called force - induced adhesion strengthening , depends on a dynamic association between integrins and F - actin , and is essential for FAs to withstand traction forces that pull the cell forward during cell migration 4 . Consequently , the destabilization of the integrin – F - actin connection or a decline in myosin II activity decreases force transmission across FAs and shortens the lifetime of integrin – ligand bonds , resulting in slippage between integrin and ligand , adhesion sliding , reduced traction forces and a drop in migration speed 5 . The association between integrins and F - actin occurs indirectly through integrin - and / or F - actin - binding proteins such as talin and vinculin 6 , which serve as a ‘molecular clutch’ that couples traction and actin - driven forces in space and time 7 – 11 . Talin consists of an amino - terminal FERM ( protein 4 . 1 , ezrin , radixin , moesin ) domain , also called the talin head domain ( THD ) , and a carboxy - terminal rod domain with 13 helical bundles ( R1 – R13 ) 12 . The THD binds β - integrin tails and mediates integrin activation . The rod domain contains binding sites for F - actin , vinculin and the Rap1 – GTP - interacting adapter molecule ( RIAM ) 6 . Talin cycles between cytosol , where it remains in an auto - inhibited form 13 , and plasma membrane , where it activates integrins and links integrins to F - actin 14 , 15 . Talin activation can be induced by RIAM binding to the R8 domain 16 – 18 , phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate synthesized by a FA - associated splice variant of phosphatidylinositol - 4 - phosphate 5 - kinase type I γ ( PIPKI γ 90 ) 15 , 19 and the actin retrograde flow , probably by unleashing the talin rod from the THD 20 , 21 . The cell - type - restricted integrin activation defects in RIAM - deficient mice and normal integrin activation in PIPKI γ 90 - deficient mice 22 – 24 suggest that additional talin activators probably exist . 1 Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry , 82152 Martinsried , Germany . 2 Department of Chemical Engineering , Stanford University , Stanford , California 94305 , USA . 3 CytoMorpho Lab , Biosciences & Biotechnology Institute of Grenoble , UMR5168 , CEA / INRA / CNRS / Université , 38054 Grenoble - Alpes , Grenoble , France . 4 Correspondence should be addressed to R .

( e ) Kank2 - positive puncta localize to the FA border deﬁned by ILK , kindlin - 2 , vinculin , talin and paxillin ( mean ± s . d . ; n = 8 FAs for each marker , data pooled from eight cells ) . Unprocessed original scans of blots are shown in Supplementary Fig . 9 . In the present paper , we identified the evolutionarily conserved Kank protein family as novel FA proteins . They consist of four mem - bers ( Kank1 – 4 ) that are characterized by a Kank N - terminal motif ( KN ) , several central coiled - coil domains and C - terminal ankyrin ( Ank ) repeats 25 . The single Kank orthologue in worms , VAB19 , controls epidermis – muscle attachment 26 , neuronal migration 27 and basement membrane remodelling 28 . Mutations in mammalian Kanks have been associated with cerebral palsy type 2 , spastic quadriple - gia ( CPSQ2 ) 29 and nephrotic syndrome 30 . Kank1 can bind liprin - β 1 through a coiled - coil domain and Kif21a through the Ank re - peats , and restrict microtubule ( MT ) outgrowth at the cell cortex and suppress stress fibre formation 31 , 32 . We report here that Kank2 localizes to the lateral border of FAs ( termed the FA belt ) and cen - tral adhesions , binds the talin rod through the KN motif , promotes talin and integrin activation , and interferes with F - actin binding to the talin rod , which suppresses mechanical force transmission across activated integrins , leading to adhesion sliding and reduced cell migration . RESULTS Kank2 is a novel FA protein To identify novel , β 1 integrin tail - associated adhesome proteins , we compared our published FA - enriched proteome ( adhesome ) 33 with the β 1 integrin tail peptide interactome 34 ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . Talin , kindlin - 2 and the ILK , PINCH , parvin ( IPP ) complex were enriched in the adhesome and the β 1 tail interactome , whereas Dab - 2 and SNX17 35 , which bind integrin tails during endosomal traﬃcking , were not enriched in the adhesome . Interestingly , Kank2 was also enriched in the adhesome and β 1 tail interactome ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . Unlike kindlin - 2 , which preferentially bound the β 1 tail , or Src and Dab - 2 , which preferentially bound the β 3 tail , Kank2 and talin bound β 1 and β 3 tails equally well ( Fig . 1a ) .

Blebbistatin - treated cells also lacked Kank2 in kindlin - 2 - positive NAs of protruding cell membranes ( Fig . 1b ) . The recruitment of Kank2 to the FA border was pronounced in cells cultured on FN - coated crossbow - shaped micropatterns ( Supplementary Fig . 1d ) . Line profile analysis revealed that the Kank2 puncta peaked at the outer FA border , where canonical FA proteins ( talin , kindlin - 2 , ILK , paxillin and vinculin ) showed ∼ 50 % of their plateau intensity ( Fig . 1c – e ) . We termed this unrecognized FA compartment the ‘FA belt’ . Co - immunostaining for β 1 and β 3 integrins revealed that β 3 integrins co - localized with paxillin in the core of mature FAs , whereastotalandactive ( labelledwiththeactivationepitope - reporting 9EG7 antibody ) β 1 accumulated in FA belts and central adhesions ( Supplementary Fig . 1e – g ) . These data show that mature FAs are surrounded by a Kank2 - and β 1 integrin - enriched belt . Kank2 is targeted to FAs through the KN motif To determine how Kank2 is recruited to the FA belt , we generated green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - tagged full length ( FL ) - Kank2 and NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 18 | NUMBER 9 | SEPTEMBER 2016 © (cid:400)(cid:398)(cid:399)(cid:406)(cid:613) Macmillan Publishers Limited (cid:422)(cid:613)(cid:47)(cid:31)(cid:49)(cid:51)(cid:613)(cid:46)(cid:36)(cid:613)(cid:21)(cid:47)(cid:49)(cid:40)(cid:45)(cid:37)(cid:35)(cid:49)(cid:613)(cid:15)(cid:31)(cid:51)(cid:52)(cid:49)(cid:35) .

All rights reserved (cid:421) NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 18 | NUMBER 9 | SEPTEMBER 2016 A RT I C L E S Kank2 - depleted mouse fibroblasts ( Supplementary Fig . 2b ) , which expressed mainly Kank2 ( Supplementary Fig . 2a – c ) . FL - Kank2 - GFP also localized to the belt of paxillin - positive mature FAs and to central adhesions ( Fig . 2b ) . In line with a previous report 31 , we also found Kank2 adjacent to FAs in liprin - β 1 - and ELKS - enriched regions ( Supplementary Fig . 3a – c ) , which capture MT plus ends and promote exocytosis . In contrast , Kank2 (cid:49) KN - GFP was absent from FA belts or central adhesions and instead accumulated in liprin - β 1 - and ELKS - positive regions adjacent to but clearly away from FA belts ( Fig . 2b , and Supplementary Fig . 3a , b ) , as shown by line profile analyses ( Fig . 2c , d ) . Although both Kank2 (cid:49) coil - GFP and Kank2 ( 1 – 670 ) - GFP showed enrichment on FA belts ( Fig . 2b – d ) , Kank2 (cid:49) coil - GFP also penetrated the FA core ( Fig . 2e ) , indicating that the coiled - coil domain contributes to the exclusion of Kank2 from the FA core . Interestingly , Kank2 recruited liprin - β 1 through the coiled - coil domain to FA belts , whereas ELKS always localized to the vicinity of the belt ( Supplementary Fig . 3a – c ) . Kank2 (cid:49) KN (cid:49) coil - GFP was diﬀusely distributed throughout the cytosol , whereas the GFP - tagged KN polypeptide completely overlapped with paxillin in all adhesions , including the small , peripheral NAs ( Fig . 2b ) . These results indicate that the KN motif localizes Kank2 to FA belts and central adhesions and that additional protein regions exclude Kank2 from the FA core . Peptide pulldowns revealed that FL - Kank2 - GFP and Kank2 - KN - GFP , but not Kank2 (cid:49) KN - GFP or GFP , associated with β 1 integrin tails ( Supplementary Fig . 3d , e ) . To investigate whether Kank1 , Kank3 and Kank4 also localize to the belt , they were tagged with GFP and expressed in Kank2 - depleted fibroblasts at similar levels as judged by GFP intensities . Kank1 - GFP and Kank3 - GFP localized to FA belts , whereas Kank4 - GFP associated with FAs with additional cytoplasmic distribution ( Supplementary Fig . 3f ) . Kank2 inhibits cell migration by inducing adhesion sliding To unravel how Kank2 is recruited to FA belts , we carried out live cell imaging of paxillin - TagRFP ( red fluorescent protein ) and Kank2 - GFP in Kank2 - depleted fibroblasts . During isotropic cell spreading on FN , Kank2 - containing puncta were visible in the proximity of FAs . A few minutes after the assembly of radial FAs , Kank2 puncta appeared at their proximal tips pointing to the cell centre , from where Kank2 spread along the FA belt during the following minutes ( Supplementary Video 1 and Supplementary Fig . 4a ) . After cell polarization ( 45min after plating ) , Kank2 puncta continued to accumulate at the proximal border of FAs ( Supplementary Video 2 and Fig . 3a ) , from where Kank2 - and paxillin - positive , thin and elongated adhesion structures developed and moved with an average speed of ∼ 0 . 3 µ mmin − 1 into the cell centre ( Supplementary Video 2 and Fig . 3a ) . In migrating cells ( 4h after plating ) , Kank2 - GFP was recruited to the proximal tips of mature FAs and then gradually spread along the FA belt , while it remained absent from NAs in lamellipodia and FAs of the lamella ( Supplementary Video 3 and Fig . 3b ) . The Kank2 - positive FA belt formation correlated with the disassembly of the FA cores and the conversion of the FA belts into thin and motile adhesions ( Supplementary Video 3 and Fig . 3b ) . In Kank2 (cid:49) KN - GFP - expressing cells , Kank2 (cid:49) KN - GFP - positive puncta moved to the proximity of FAs but never entered the FA belt ( Supplementary Video 4 and Fig . 3c , closed arrowheads ) . Moreover , FAs failed to elongateandslide , andthefewcentraladhesionsthatformedremained stationary ( Supplementary Video 4 and Fig . 3c ) . The stationary FAs in Kank2 (cid:49) KN - GFP - expressing cells disassembled behind the lamella ( Fig . 3d ) with similar rates as in cells expressing FL - Kank2 ( Supplementary Video 4 and Supplementary Fig . 4b , c ) , indicating that adhesion sliding is not caused by adhesion disassembly . Our data suggest that Kank2 decorates FA belts in a KN - motif - dependent manner and induces the gliding of belts into the cell centre . To confirm that Kank2 induces adhesion motility , we recorded vinculin - mCherry co - expressed in Kank2 - depleted fibroblasts with either GFP - tagged FL or mutant Kank2 ( Supplementary Videos 5 – 10 ) . Overlay of 10 sequential colour - coded vinculin - mCherry frames revealed that central adhesions in FL - Kank - GFP - and Kank2 ( 1 – 670 ) - expressing cells appeared as rainbows in overlay images due to their significant displacements , whereas central adhesions of cells expressing Kank2 (cid:49) KN - GFP , Kank2 (cid:49) coil - GFP , KN - GFP or GFP alone were stationary and appeared white in overlay images ( Supplementary Fig . 4d ) . Single - adhesion tracking revealed that central adhesions in FL - Kank2 - GFP - and Kank2 ( 1 – 670 ) - expressing cells moved with a sliding velocity of ∼ 0 . 3 µ mmin − 1 , whereas sliding of central adhesions in cells expressing Kank2 (cid:49) KN - GFP , Kank2 (cid:49) coil - GFP , KN - GFP or GFP alone was slower ( Fig . 3e ) . Furthermore , over 60 % of adhesions in FL - Kank2 - GFP - and Kank2 ( 1 – 670 ) - GFP - expressing cells slid with rates higher than 0 . 3 µ mmin − 1 , whereas the numbers of fast - sliding adhesions were significantly lower in cells expressing Kank2 (cid:49) KN - GFP , Kank2 (cid:49) coil - GFP , KN - GFP or GFP alone ( Supplementary Fig . 4e ) . Consistent with the absence of Kank2 from adhesions in the protruding front , the sliding velocity of adhesions in protrusion was unaﬀected by the FL or mutant Kank2 ( Fig . 3e ) . Adhesion sliding correlates with reduced cell migration speed 7 . Indeed , both Kank2 - depleted cell lines showed higher migration velocities when compared with controls ( Supplementary Fig . 4f ) . Furthermore , expression of FL - Kank2 - GFP and Kank2 ( 1 – 670 ) - GFP but not Kank2 (cid:49) KN - GFP , Kank2 (cid:49) coil - GFP , KN - GFP or GFP alone in Kank2 - depleted fibroblasts decreased migration speed ( Fig . 3f ) . ConsistentwiththeabsenceofKank2fromthecellfront , cellspreading was unaﬀected in Kank2 - depleted cells or cells expressing Kank2 constructs ( Supplementary Fig . 4g ) . Centripetal α 5 β 1 integrin translocation was proposed to mediate FN fibrillogenesis 36 . We noticed that Kank2 - positive central adhesions formed within 1h of plating on FN before FN fibrillogenesis occurred , whereas , 5h after cell seeding , thin FN fibrils , frequently decorated with Kank2 , extended from the cell periphery to the cell centre ( Fig . 3g ) . After overnight culture , FL - Kank2 - GFP - expressing cells assembled extensive networks of elongated and branched FN fibrils , compared with the few and thickened FN fibrils in GFP - expressing Kank2 - depleted cells ( Fig . 3h ) . Kank2 induces integrin – ligand - bound slippage Adhesion sliding can be due to ECM cleavage by metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) 37 or turnover of integrin – ligand complexes 38 . Treatment of FL - Kank2 - GFP - expressing cells with the pan - MMP inhibitor Gm6001 did not aﬀect adhesion sliding ( Supplementary Fig . 4h ) . To analyse integrin turnover , we photobleached the C - terminally GFP - tagged α 5 integrin ( Itga5 - GFP ) in entire adhesions of Kank2 - depleted cells expressing FL - Kank2 - mCherry or an empty control NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 18 | NUMBER 9 | SEPTEMBER 2016 © (cid:400)(cid:398)(cid:399)(cid:406)(cid:613) Macmillan Publishers Limited (cid:422)(cid:613)(cid:47)(cid:31)(cid:49)(cid:51)(cid:613)(cid:46)(cid:36)(cid:613)(cid:21)(cid:47)(cid:49)(cid:40)(cid:45)(cid:37)(cid:35)(cid:49)(cid:613)(cid:15)(cid:31)(cid:51)(cid:52)(cid:49)(cid:35) .

To distinguish slippage between integrin and ligand from adhesion treadmilling as the cause of adhesion sliding , we photobleached Itga5 - GFP in the middle segment of an adhesion and measured GFP recovery . In the case of treadmilling defined by integrin recruitment to the proximal end and release from the distal ends the bleached middle segment should remain stationary ( Fig . 4d , left panel ) , whereas in the case of slippage between integrin and ligand the bleached middle segment should move in the direction of the adhesion sliding , at least during the short time window before integrins are turned over ( Fig . 4d , right panel ) .

Similarly , photobleaching of FL - Kank2 - GFP in the middle segment of a sliding adhesion revealed the same co - sliding of bleached and unbleached areas ( Fig . 4g ) . In contrast , photobleaching of Itga5 - GFP in the middle segment of a stationary adhesion in Kank2 - depleted cells revealed that neither bleached nor unbleached regions slid ( Fig . 4f ) . These findings indicate that Kank2 destabilizes integrin – ligand complexes , leading to sliding of the Kank2 – integrin complex along the ECM and the formation of FN fibrils .

Kank2 suppresses force transmission across integrins Areducedforcetransmissionacrossintegrinscandestabilizeintegrin – ligand bonds . To test this possibility , we plated fibroblasts expressing GFP - tagged FL - Kank2 , Kank2 (cid:49) KN , Kank2 (cid:49) coil , Kank2 ( 1 – 670 ) , Kank2 - KN or GFP alone on RGD peptides conjugated with a Förster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) - based molecular tension sensor , which decreases FRET eﬃciency under tension 39 . To visualize FRET maps recorded by total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy , we inverted the FRET ratios such that bright signals correspond to low FRET ratios and high traction . We found that FL - Kank2wasenrichedatproximalbordersoftensionedRGDpeptide clustersinthecellperipheryandincentraladhesionswithlowinverted FRET signals . In contrast , Kank2 (cid:49) KN was absent from tensioned RGD ligand clusters in the periphery and the cell centre , whereas the KN polypeptide overlapped with tensioned RGD clusters in the cell periphery and less frequently in the cell centre ( Fig . 5a – c ) . To determine the coincidence between the GFP - tagged proteins and locally generated tension , we calculated the 2D correlation coeﬃcient between the GFP - tagged proteins and inverted FRET signals and found that tension had a negative correlation with FL - Kank2 ( − 0 . 33 ) and Kank2 (cid:49) KN ( − 0 . 55 ) and a positive correlation with the KN polypeptide ( 0 . 33 ; Fig . 5f ) . Moreover , FL - Kank2 significantly decreased the force at peripheral adhesions when compared with the Kank2 - KN ( Fig . 5g ) . Furthermore , the ratios between high - ( nominal stress of ≥ 250pN µ m − 2 ) and low - force - ( nominal stress of < 250pN µ m 2 ) bearing adhesion areas were significantly decreased 948 © (cid:400)(cid:398)(cid:399)(cid:406)(cid:613) Macmillan Publishers Limited (cid:422)(cid:613)(cid:47)(cid:31)(cid:49)(cid:51)(cid:613)(cid:46)(cid:36)(cid:613)(cid:21)(cid:47)(cid:49)(cid:40)(cid:45)(cid:37)(cid:35)(cid:49)(cid:613)(cid:15)(cid:31)(cid:51)(cid:52)(cid:49)(cid:35) .

Unprocessed original scans of blots are shown in Supplementary Fig . 9 . in FL - Kank2 - expressing cells ( Fig . 5h ) , indicating that FL - Kank2 curbs force transmission across adhesion sites . Importantly , deletion of the liprin - β 1 - binding coiled - coil domain ( Kank2 (cid:49) coil ) but not the deletion of the Kif21a - binding Ank repeats , reduced the negative correlation with the locally generated tension and failed to diminish force transmission across integrins ( Fig . 5d – h ) . Depletion of liprin - β 1 reduced endogenous and overexpressed Kank2 levels ( Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . Although liprin - β 1 depletion slightly aﬀected the negative correlation between FL - Kank2 - GFP and tension ( Supplementary Fig . 5b ) , force transmission remained unaﬀected ( Fig . 5i and Supplementary Fig . 5c ) , indicating that the coiled - coil domain in Kank2 regulates force transmission in a liprin - β 1 - independent manner .

( g ) Model depicting Kank function in FAs . In migrating cells , Kank2 is absent from adhesion sites of the protrusion front . Behind the lamella , Kank2 is ﬁrst recruited to the proximal tips of mature FAs , from where it gradually spreads over the entire FA belt . The recruitment of Kank2 to the FA belt is mediated by a direct interaction between the KN motif of Kank2 and the R7 domain in the talin rod . Kank2 displaces F - actin from the talin - ABS2 while simultaneously promoting and / or maintaining talin activation . This dual function of Kank2 permits a partial decoupling of talin - bound , activated integrins from the actomyosin cytoskeleton , leading to diminished force transmission across FAs , reduced traction force , formation of slip bonds between integrins and ligands and the conversion of FA belts into sliding central adhesions . Unprocessed original scans of blots are shown in Supplementary Fig . 9 . less traction force than did cells expressing Kank2 (cid:49) KN , Kank2 (cid:49) coil , the KN polypeptide or the GFP control ( Fig . 5j , k ) . Kank2 directly binds the talin rod To unravel how Kank2 is recruited to the FA belt and suppresses integrin - mediated force transmission , we carried out pulldown experiments with diﬀerent integrin tail peptides , which revealed that the Kank2 - binding profile resembled that of talin but diﬀered from that of kindlin - 2 ( Fig . 6a ) . Furthermore , talin - binding - deficient β 1 tails ( β 1 Y783A ) pulled down neither Kank2 nor talin , but still kindlin - 2 ( Fig . 6a ) , suggesting that talin and Kank2 are co - recruited to integrin tails . 950 © (cid:400)(cid:398)(cid:399)(cid:406)(cid:613) Macmillan Publishers Limited (cid:422)(cid:613)(cid:47)(cid:31)(cid:49)(cid:51)(cid:613)(cid:46)(cid:36)(cid:613)(cid:21)(cid:47)(cid:49)(cid:40)(cid:45)(cid:37)(cid:35)(cid:49)(cid:613)(cid:15)(cid:31)(cid:51)(cid:52)(cid:49)(cid:35) . All rights reserved (cid:421) NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 18 | NUMBER 9 | SEPTEMBER 2016 A RT I C L E S To identify Kank2 - interacting proteins that mediate its recruitment to β integrin tails , we immunoprecipitated FL - Kank2 - GFP in fibroblasts and determined the interacting proteins by mass spectrometry ( MS ) . Talin - 1 , dynein light chain isoforms ( Dynll1 and Dynll2 ) and liprin - β 1 were identified as binding partners of Kank2 ( Fig . 6b ) . To test whether Kank is recruited to β 1 tails in a talin - dependent manner , we carried out β 1 tail peptide pulldown in fibroblasts lacking the Talin - 1 and Talin - 2 genes 40 and found that the absence of talin - 1 and talin - 2 expression abolished Kank2 recruitment to β 1 integrin tails ( Fig . 6c ) . Since the FA belt recruitment is KN motif dependent , we purified recombinant glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) - KN , full length talin - 1 ( FL - talin - 1 ) and the THD ( Supplementary Fig . 6a ) and carried out GST pulldown experiments , which showed that the GST - KN motif pulled down FL - talin - 1 but not the THD ( Fig . 6d ) , indicating that Kank2 binds the talin - 1 rod through the KN motif . Expression of diﬀerent GFP - tagged domains of the talin - 1 rod in HEK293 cells followed by co - immunoprecipitation of GST - KN with GFP antibodies revealed that R7R8 domains but not the R8 domain alone associated with the KN polypeptide ( Supplementary Fig . 6b ) . Furthermore , recombinant Venus - tagged talin R4 – R8 eﬃciently bound GST - KN - coupled glutathione beads but not control GST beads ( Fig . 6e ) . These findings indicate that Kank2 directly binds the R7R8 domain of the talin rod through the KN motif . Kank2 induces talin and β 1 integrin activation The R7R8 domains were shown to bind RIAM , actin and vinculin 41 , all of which can induce activation of talin , which in turn binds and activates integrins . To investigate whether Kank2 or KN binding to talin also promotes talin – integrin interactions , we carried out a series ofexperiments . First , shorthairpinRNA ( shRNA ) - mediateddepletion of Kank2 in fibroblasts decreased binding of endogenous talin to β 1 integrin tail peptides by about 30 % ( Fig . 7a ) , whereas doxycycline - induced expression of FL - Kank2 - GFP but not Kank2 (cid:49) KN - GFP increased talin binding to β 1 integrin tails in a dose - dependent manner ( Supplementary Fig . 7a , b ) . Second , incubation of normal fibroblast lysates with GST - KN or chemically synthesized KN peptide eﬃciently reduced endogenous Kank2 binding to β 1 integrin tail peptides and increased talin binding in a dose - dependent manner , but left kindlin - 2 and Dab - 2 binding unchanged ( Fig . 7b and Supplementary Fig . 7c – e ) . Third , β 1 tails pulled down about five times more recombinant FL - talin in the presence of equal molar GST - KN or recombinant FL - Kank2 ( Supplementary Fig . 7f ) when compared with GST only ( Fig . 7c , d ) . Fourth , the KN - peptide - mediated activation of FL - talin depended on the THD in full length talin , as it was eﬃciently blocked by an excess amount of THD domain ( Supplementary Fig . 7g , h ) . Finally , co - expression of talin - GFP and Cherry - tagged FL - Kank2 in Kank2 - depleted fibroblasts increased talin - GFP signals in kindlin - 2 - positive central adhesions and expression of the KN motif promoted talin - GFP localization to peripheral FAs ( Fig . 7e , f ) , whereas Kank2 (cid:49) KN - or Cherry - expressing cells had the majority of talin - 1 - GFP in the cytosol ( Fig . 7e , f ) . Thus Kank2 induces talin activation and binding to integrin β tails . Since active , integrin - tail - bound talin induces integrin activation , we next tested whether Kank2 promotes integrin activation . The expressionoftalin - 1togetherwithFL - Kank2 - GFPin α IIb β 3 - integrin - expressing CHO cells increased binding of the α IIb β 3 integrin activation epitope - reporting PAC1 antibody when compared with cells expressing talin - 1 and GFP ( Fig . 7g ) . Importantly , expression of talin - 1 and Kank2 (cid:49) KN failed to increase PAC1 binding over the talin - 1 / GFP control ( Fig . 7g ) . Similarly , immunostaining with 9EG7 antibody of FN - adherent Kank2 - depleted fibroblasts expressing GFP - tagged FL - Kank2 , Kank2 (cid:49) KN , Kank2 - KN or GFP alone revealed that FL - Kank2 - GFP and Kank2 - KN - GFP co - localized with active , 9EG7 - positive β 1 integrins and increased the number of 9EG7 - positiveadhesionsites , whereasKank2 (cid:49) KN - GFPorGFPalonehadno eﬀect on 9EG7 binding ( Fig . 7h , i ) . Altogether , these findings indicate that Kank2 activates talin and integrins in a KN - motif - dependent manner . Kank2 interferes with F - actin binding to the ABS2 of talin How does Kank2 binding to talin decrease force transmission across integrins ? Kank2 was shown to regulate RhoA and myosin II activities through an association with RhoGDI α in kidney podocytes 30 , 32 . In contrast to podocytes , however , RhoGDI α was neither identified as a binding partner of FL - Kank2 - GFP in the MS - based Kank2 interactome screen nor co - localized with FL - Kank2 in fibroblasts ( Supplementary Fig . 8a ) . Furthermore , similar GTP - bound RhoA and phospho - Ser 19 - myosin light chain ( pMLC ) levels in cells expressing FL - Kank2 , Kank2 (cid:49) KN , the KN polypeptide or GFP ( Supplementary Fig . 8b , c ) excluded a role for Kank2 in regulating myosin II activity . The destabilization of the Talin – F - actin linkage can also decrease force transmission across integrins . Kank2 binds talin in the vicinity of the F - actin - binding site 2 ( ABS2 ) . To test whether Kank2 and actin binding to the talin rod is mutually regulated , we incubated recom - binant His - tagged talin R4 – R8 - coated Ni 2 + - NTA ( nitrilotriacetate ) beadswithFL - Kank2andactinunderpolymerization - permissivecon - ditions and observed a dose - dependent inhibition of Kank2 binding to talin R4 – R8 by actin ( Fig . 8a , b ) . Consistently , recombinant FL - Kank2 but not GST - KN significantly decreased actin binding to His - tagged talin R4 – R8 - coated Ni 2 + - NTA beads ( Fig . 8c , d ) . These results suggest that Kank2 interferes with actin binding to ABS2 . The association of talin with F - actin was shown to immobilize talin in FAs 42 , 43 . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) experiments in Kank2 - depleted fibroblasts expressing FL - Kank2 or mutant versions of Kank2 showed that FL - Kank2 increased the mobile fraction of talin - GFP from 63 . 8 ± 9 . 0 % to 92 . 4 ± 7 . 5 % in a 5min time window ( Fig . 8e , f and Supplementary Fig . 8d ) , whereas neither Kank2 (cid:49) KNnorKank2 - KNaﬀectedthemobilefractionoftalin . These findings confirm that Kank2 destabilizes the talin – F - actin linkage . DISCUSSION Kank proteins are defined by a unique KN motif . While a recent study reported that Kank proteins in HeLa cells localize to liprin - β 1 - and ELKS - containing clusters at the plasma membrane that capture MTs in close proximity to , but always outside FAs 31 , we found Kank highly enriched in the β 1 integrin tail interactome and the integrin - induced adhesome , pointing to the possibility that Kank proteins also directly function inside FAs . We tested this hypothesis and found that Kank proteins are indeed present in FAs , where they play a dual role : on the one hand they control integrin activity through activating talin , and on the other hand they reduce the talin linkage with the NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 18 | NUMBER 9 | SEPTEMBER 2016 © (cid:400)(cid:398)(cid:399)(cid:406)(cid:613) Macmillan Publishers Limited (cid:422)(cid:613)(cid:47)(cid:31)(cid:49)(cid:51)(cid:613)(cid:46)(cid:36)(cid:613)(cid:21)(cid:47)(cid:49)(cid:40)(cid:45)(cid:37)(cid:35)(cid:49)(cid:613)(cid:15)(cid:31)(cid:51)(cid:52)(cid:49)(cid:35) . All rights reserved (cid:421) 951 A RT I C L E S actomyosin , which leads to reduced force transmission across FAs , increased adhesion sliding and reduced cell migration speed . Our analysis shows that Kank recruitment to β integrin tails is indirect and occurs through a direct interaction between the KN motif of Kank and the talin R7 domain . The consequence of the Kank – talin interaction is the activation of talin , the binding of the Kank / talin to β integrin tails , integrin activation and integrin – ligand binding . The activation of talin and integrins by Kank is KN motif dependent . In line with this finding , the KN polypeptide is suﬃcient to induce talin activation and recruitment to β 1 integrin tails in vitro and to FAs ex vivo , and to activate α IIb β 3 and β 1 integrins in cells . Our findings also demonstrate that Kank reduces the cell migration speed by converting FAs at the lamella border into thin and elongated sliding adhesions that glide into the cell centre ( Fig . 7 ) . Kank is absent from NAs and becomes recruited to the proximal tip of FAs at the lamella border either by binding to tensed , integrin - bound talin or as a de novo assembled Kank2 – talin complex . From the proximal FA tips Kank gradually expands around the entire outer FA border , which is followed by the disassembly of the FA core and the gliding of the thin Kank2 - positive FA border into the cell centre . We term the outer FA border , to which Kank concentrates during FA conversion , the FA belt . The exclusive localization of the KN - motif - deficient Kank2 (cid:49) KN to the previously described liprin - β 1 - and ELKS - containing clusters and the inability of Kank2 (cid:49) KN to induce FA sliding indicate that both FA belt recruitment and FA sliding depend on talin binding . Furthermore , the KN polypeptide also penetrates into the FA centre but fails to induce FA sliding , pointing to the functional importance of additional region ( s ) in Kank such as the coiled - coil domain . We also found that Kank binding to talin destabilizes the integrin – actomyosin linkage , leading to decreased force transmission across adhesion sites , which diminishes adhesion strength and traction force , causing integrin – ligand bond slippage , FA sliding and a reduction in migration speed . The destabilization of the integrin – actomyosin linkage occurs with Kank2 binding to the talin rod . Since the KN motif is not suﬃcient to compete with actin for talin rod binding and for curbing force transmission across integrins , additional region ( s ) in Kank2 are required to execute these tasks . Such a region could be the coiled - coil domain , whose absence enabled a partial intrusion of the mutant Kank2 (cid:49) coil protein into the FA core , impaired the negative correlation with locally produced tension and failed to reduce force transmission across integrins . Mechanistically , the coiled - coil domain could hinder F - actin binding to talin - ABS2 either by oligomerizing Kank2 44 or by recruiting proteins such as liprin - β 1 . However , the localization of Kank2 to the FA belt and the normal force transduction after liprin - β 1 depletion exclude liprin - β 1 as potential binding partner of the coiled - coil domain for this function . Alternatively , Kank may bind as - yet - unidentified protein ( s ) that abrogate ( s ) talin – integrin tail binding on the FA belt . Such talin binding partners , however , would probably disassemble rather than convert the FA belt into a sliding central adhesion . The reduced F - actin binding to talin by Kank2 provides a reasonable explanation for the reduced force transmitted across talin – Kank2 complexes to ligand - bound integrins , increased integrin turnover and slippage of integrin ligand bonds , which altogether leads to adhesion sliding and reduced migration speed ( Fig . 8g ) . Consistent with our findings , cells carrying mutations in the ABS2 of talin also show reduced actomyosin coupling to integrin adhesion sites , an increase of the mobile fraction of talin and a decrease of the traction force without aﬀecting cell adhesion or spreading 11 . Kank2 was also shown to bind RhoGDI α , which can potentially inhibit RhoA activity at FA belts and suppress formin - dependent F - actin filament assembly and Rock - mediated myosin II activities 30 , 32 , 45 . However , we did not detect RhoGDI α in our MS - based Kank2 interactome or colocalized with Kank2 at FA belts . Furthermore , the normal levels of active RhoA and pMLC in cells expressing FL - Kank2 suggest that RhoA - dependent myosinIIactivityisnotgrosslyaltered , althoughsubtlechangescannot be excluded with our assays . Kank proteins are also found in liprin - β 1 - and ELKS - enriched clusters at the plasma membrane where MT plus ends are captured to allow focal exocytosis of MT1 - MMP and other cargo 31 , 46 – 48 , which could also contribute to adhesion sliding and cell migration velocity control . However , Kank2 - induced adhesion sliding was not altered when the activities of MMPs were inhibited or MT targeting to FAs was compromised by depleting CLASP 46 , indicating that talin – Kank2 complex on FA belts and the ELKS – liprin - β 1 – Kank2 complex function separately . It is conceivable , however , that Kank proteins coordinate the properties of both compartments and thereby adjust MT dynamics and ECM remodelling with adhesion strengthening .

Viral transduction and transient transfection of cell lines . SV40 large T - immortalized mouse kidney - derived fibroblasts have been previously described 6 and were used to analyse the Kank proteins . For the analysis of integrin α 5 - GFP turnover , mouse kidney fibroblasts were transduced with lentivirus expressing human integrin α 5 - GFP , and cells with low expression were FACS - sorted . HEK293 cells were used for GFP pulldown of diﬀerent talin rod domains . Transient transfections were carried out with Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Transduction of VSV - G pseudotyped retroviral vectors produced by transient transfection of HEK293T were used to generate stable cell lines as previously described 52 . The cell lines used here were not found in the database of commonly misidentified cell lines maintained by ICLAC and NCBI BioSample . The cell lines were tested for mycoplasma contamination and were found to be negative . ImmunoprecipitationandGSTpulldown . ForimmunoprecipitationofGFP - tagged proteins , cells were lysed in M - PER ( Thermo Scientific , no 78501 ) buﬀer and immunoprecipitatedusingthe µ MACSGFPIsolationKit ( MiltenyiBiotec ) following the manufacturer’s protocol . Elutes were separated in SDS – PAGE for Western blotting or for in - gel digestion and mass spectrometry analysis . For GST pulldown experiments , recombinant talin - 1 and THD , respectively , were re - buﬀered in GST binding buﬀer ( 50mM Tris - HCl at pH 7 . 5 , 137mM NaCl , 13mM KCl , 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 ) with Zebra Desalt Spin Columns ( Thermo Scientific ) . 200nM GST or GST - Kank2 - KN fusion proteins were incubated with 100nM recombinant talin - 1 or 300nM THD for 30min at 4 ◦ C and incubated with glutathione Sepharose ( GE Healthcare ) for another 1 . 5h at 4 ◦ C . The resin was washed three times with the GST binding buﬀer and eluted in × 2 Laemmli buﬀer at 95 ◦ C for 2min . Samples were analysed by Western blot using antibodies against THD or GST . In vitro F - actin competition assay . 24 µ M purified alpha skeletal muscle actin ( no 8010 - 01 , HYPERMOL ) and Atto565 - labelled alpha skeletal muscle actin ( no 8162 - 1 , HYPERMOL ) were polymerized in PolyMix buﬀer ( 100mM KCl , 10mM imidazole at pH7 . 4 , 1mM ATP and 2mM MgCl 2 ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and stored on ice . The percentage of polymerized actin was estimated to be about 95 % by F - actin sedimentation assay at 100 , 000 g for 1h at 25 ◦ C . To test the eﬀects of F - actin on the interaction between the talin R4 – R8 domain and FL - Kank2 , 0 . 4 µ M Venus - His - Sumo - tagged R4 – R8 domain was incubated with 0 . 2 µ M FL - Kank2 in PolyMix buﬀer for 1h on ice before supplementing with 1 µ M , 2 µ M and 5 µ M polymerized actin or empty buﬀer , and then incubated with Ni 2 + - NTA beads at 4 ◦ C for 1h . Beads were washed with PolyMix buﬀer at 4 ◦ C three times , and bound proteins were analysed by Western blotting . To visualize actin recruitment onto the talin R4 – R8 domain , 5 % BSA or 2 µ M Venus - His - Sumo - tagged R4 – R8 domain were diluted in 30 µ l KMEI buﬀer ( 50mM KCl , 10mM imidazole at pH 7 . 1 , 1mM EDTA , 2mM MgCl 2 ) and incubated with Ni 2 + - NTA beads at 4 ◦ C for 30min . Then 10 µ l buﬀer ( 20mM HEPES at pH 7 . 5 , 150mMKCl , 3mMDTT , 5 % glycerol ) containing5 µ MFL - Kank2 , re - buﬀered5 µ M GST - KN motif or control buﬀer was added and incubated for 30min at 4 ◦ C . 10 µ l © (cid:400)(cid:398)(cid:399)(cid:406)(cid:613) Macmillan Publishers Limited (cid:422)(cid:613)(cid:47)(cid:31)(cid:49)(cid:51)(cid:613)(cid:46)(cid:36)(cid:613)(cid:21)(cid:47)(cid:49)(cid:40)(cid:45)(cid:37)(cid:35)(cid:49)(cid:613)(cid:15)(cid:31)(cid:51)(cid:52)(cid:49)(cid:35) .

Integrin tail peptide pulldowns . Peptide pulldowns were carried out as previously described 35 with the β 1 wild - type cytoplasmic tail peptide ( HDRREFAKFEKEKMN AKWDTGENPIYKSAVTTVVNPKYEGK - OH ) , β 1 Y795A tail peptide ( HDRREF AKFEKEKMNAKWDTGENPIYKSAVTTVVNPKAEGK - OH ) , β 3 wild - type tail peptide ( HDRKEFAKFEEERARAKWDTANNPLYKEATSTFTNITYRGT - OH ) , β 5 wild - type tail peptide ( HDRREFAKFQSERSRARYEMASNPLYRKPISTHTVD FAFNKFNKSYNGSVD - OH ) , β 2 wild - type tail peptide ( TDLREYRRFEKEKLKSQ WNN - DNPLFKSATTTVMNPKFAES - OH ) and a scrambled peptide ( EYEFEPDK VDTGAKGTKMAKNEKKFRNYTVHNIWESRKVAP - OH ) . The tail peptides were synthesized de novo with a desthiobiotin on the N - terminus , coupled to Dynabeads MyOne streptavidin C1 ( 10mgml − 1 , Invitrogen ) , incubated with cell lysates and after a mild wash with washing buﬀer containing 137mM NaCl , 13mM KCl , 50mM Tris - HCl at pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 , supplemented with 1 % BSA and then with M - PER buﬀer . Bound proteins were eluted in × 2 Laemmli buﬀer at 95 ◦ C for 5min . For the in vitro talin activation assay , 10nM recombinant talin - 1 was diluted in the washing buﬀer and then incubated with 10nM GST or GST - Kank2 - KN together with β 1 - integrin - tail - peptide - coupled Dynabeads at 4 ◦ C . Beads were washed three times with washing buﬀer and eluted with × 2 Laemmli buﬀer at 95 ◦ C for 5min . The chemically synthesized KN peptide ( DPPYSVETPYGYRLDLDFLKYVDDIEKGHTLRRVAVQRRPRLGS ) usedfortalin activation assays was N - terminally acetylated and C - terminally amide - protected . For competition assay between THD and FL - talin in the presence of KN peptide , 10nM FL - talin - 1 was activated with 50nM chemically synthesized KN peptide and competed with 20nM and 60nM THD . CHO - based α IIb β 3 integrin activation assay . The α IIb β 3 integrin activation was assessed in CHO cells stably expressing human α IIb β 3 integrin ( A5 cells ) 53 by flow cytometry using the ligand - mimetic antibody PAC1 ( BD ) 54 . CHO cells were lipofected with 1 µ g of plasmids expressing eGFP - tagged Kank2 constructs and / or 3 µ g TagRFP - tagged talin - 1 or GFP - tagged THD . Cells were trypsinized 24h after transfection and incubated with the PAC1 antibody ( BD ) in Tyrode’s buﬀer ( pH 7 . 35 ) for 30min on ice , washed and stained with a secondary IgM for 30 min on ice followed by a final wash and staining with a streptavidin - Cy5 for 30min on ice . PAC1 binding was measured with a FACS Canto , gated for living cells , using 7AAD ( Thermo ) exclusion as well as GFP – RFP double - positive cells . Total α IIb β 3 integrin surface levels were determined with an anti - α IIb integrin antibody ( HIP8 , BioLegend ) . Data evaluation was carried out with the FlowJo software .

Polyacrylamide gel micropatterning . Micropatterns were first produced on glass coverslips as previously described 55 . Briefly , 20mm square glass coverslips were oxidized through oxygen plasma ( FEMTO , Diener Electronic ) for 10s at 30 W before incubating with 0 . 1mgml − 1 poly - L - lysine ( PLL ) – PEG ( polyethylene glycol ) ( PLL20K - G35 - PEG2K , JenKem ) in 10mM HEPES at pH 7 . 4 for 30min . After drying , coverslips were exposed to 165nm UV ( UVO - Cleaner , Jelight ) through a photomask ( Toppan ) for 5min . Then , coverslips were incubated with 20mgml − 1 of FN ( FF1141 , Sigma ) and 20 µ gml − 1 fluorescently labelled fibrinogen ( Alexa Fluor 647 conjugate , no F35200 , Invitrogen ) in 100mM sodium bicarbonate solution at pH 8 . 3 for 30min . The polyacrylamide solution was prepared by mixing acrylamide and bis - acrylamide ( Sigma ) in a respective ratio of 8 % / 0 . 264 % , resulting in a measured Young’s modulus of 35kPa . The polyacrylamide solution was de - gassed for around 30min and mixed with passivated fluorescent beads ( red fluorescent FluoSpheres carboxylate - modified microspheres , 0 . 2 µ m F8810 , Thermo Fisher ) by sonication before adding ammonium persulfate and tetramethylethylenediamine . 25 µ l of the solution was immediately deposited on the ROI on the photomask and incubated for 21 min under a silanized coverslip . The silanized coverslip was then carefully removedinthepresenceofsodiumbicarbonateandthegelsstoredovernightat4 ◦ C insodiumbicarbonate . CoverslipswerewashedinsterilePBSbeforeseedingthecells and then mounted in a magnetic chamber ( Chamlide , LCI ) for TFM processing . Traction - force microscopy and image analysis . Images of cells , beads and patterns were acquired with a confocal spinning disk system ( Eclipse Ti - E Nikon inverted microscope ) equipped with a CSUX1 - A1 Yokogawa confocal head , an Evolve EMCCD camera ( Roper Scientific , Princeton Instrument ) and a Nikon CFI Plan - APO VC × 60 – numerical aperture 1 . 4 oil immersion objective ) . The system was controlled by MetaMorph software ( Universal Imaging ) . TFMandimageanalysiswerecarriedoutasdescribed . Allprocessingwascarried out using ImageJ ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij ) . Plugins and macros are available at https : / / sites . google . com / site / qingzongtseng / tfm . First , bead images are aligned to correct experimental drift . Displacement field was calculated using particle image velocimetry on the basis of a normalized cross - correlation algorithm following an iterative scheme . The final grid size for the displacement fields was 0 . 267 µ m × 0 . 267 µ m . Subsequently , the traction - force field was calculated by means of Fourier transform traction cytometry with a regularization parameter set to 2 × 10 − 10 . FNfibrillogenesisassay . Cellswereseededat90 % confluenceontocoverslipscoated with 10 µ gml − 1 FN ( Calbiochem ) at 37 ◦ C and cultured for 12h in normal culture medium before paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) fixation and immunostaining . Immunofluorescence microscopy . For immunostaining , cells were cultured on glass coated with 10 µ gml − 1 FN ( Calbiochem ) for 5h , then fixed with cold methanol : acetone ( 1 : 1 ) for 5min at − 20 ◦ C ( for endogenous talin , vinculin and kindlin - 2 staining ) followed by 15min rehydration in PBS at room temperature , or with 2 % PFA – PBS for 15min at room temperature ( for other immunostaining ) . PFA - fixed cells were permeabilized when indicated with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 – PBS for 30min at room temperature . Fixed cells were blocked with 5 % BSA in PBS for 1h at room temperature followed by incubation with the primary antibodies in 5 % BSA in PBS overnight at 4 ◦ C and then with secondary antibodies for 1h at room temperature . Images were collected at room temperature on a Zeiss ( Jena ) LSM780confocallaserscanningmicroscopeequippedwithaZeissPlan - APO × 63 – numerical aperture 1 . 46 oil immersion objective . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching . FRAP and fluorescence live cell imaging were carried out on a Zeiss ( Jena ) LSM780 confocal laser scanning microscope equipped with a Zeiss Plan - APO × 63 – numerical aperture 1 . 46 oil immersion objective with environmental control ( 5 % CO 2 and humidification ) . Cells were cultured on 10 µ gml − 1 FN - coated glass - bottom live cell imaging chambers ( ibidi ) . ForFRAPexperiments , theROIwasbleachedwithfulllaserpower at 488nm for 30 iterations and fluorescence recovery was monitored for 5min with 20sintervalsand1 % laserpowerfortalin - GFPturnover , orwasmonitoredfor5min with 10s intervals and 1 % laser power for integrin α 5 - GFP turnover . No significant photobleaching was observed during the post - bleaching phase . FRAP data were extracted with ImageJ . Due to the rapid diﬀusion of cytosolic talin into the bleached area immediately after bleaching , the mean optical intensity outside adhesion was subtracted from the mean optical intensity in FAs to correct the background . FRAP curves were fitted to a one - phase association model to calculate the mobile fraction . Confocal microscopy live cell imaging . For confocal microscopy live cell imaging , we used the same microscopic setting as for FRAP . Cells were imaged for the indicated time with 20s or 30s intervals with 1 – 3 % laser power depending on the fluorophores . To block MMP activities , cells were plated for 5h with or without 50 µ M GM6001 ( no sc - 203979 , Santa Cruz ) before live cell imaging . For data illustration , fluorescent images were background - subtracted and passed through low - pass filters followed by Unsharp Mask in ImageJ . For the tracking of sliding adhesions , a time lapse of 20min with 2min intervals was extracted from the full Supplementary Videos . Raw images were background - subtracted . Single adhesions were identified by thresholding and tracked with the TrackMate plugin in ImageJ . Structures with sizes below 3 pixels ( 0 . 04 µ m per pixel ) were excluded . Adhesion sites with lifetimes above 6min were tracked to measure their sliding velocities . Average adhesion sliding velocities were calculated on the basis of all analysed adhesions for each cell . For the determination of sliding velocities of central adhesions , vinculin - mCherry - positive adhesions were analysed within 20 µ m distance from nuclei in the first frame . For the FAs in the cell protrusions , vinculin - mCherry - positive adhesions were analysed within 10 µ m behind the protruding leading edge in the first frame . Intensity - based immunofluorescence image analysis . For line profile analysis , the fluorescenceintensityalongatransverselineacrosselongatedFAswasanalysedwithImageJ . The pixel position of the intensity peak for the Kank2 puncta was defined as the position of Kank2 . Pixel positions corresponding to 50 % of the average plateau intensity for conventional adhesion markers were manually annotated . Kindlin - 2 was used to analyse the localization of talin - 1 - GFP at adhesion sites . GFP intensities outside kindlin - 2 - positive areas were considered cytosolic . Mean opticalintensitiesofGFPwithinandoutsidekindlin - 2 - positiveareasweremeasured in ImageJ . For quantification of active β 1 integrin levels on the ventral cell surface of adherent cells , PFA - fixed cells were stained with the rat monoclonal antibody 9EG7 without permeabilization .

Subsequently , cell migration was recorded with a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M equipped with a × 10 – numerical aperture 0 . 3 objective , a motorized stage ( Märzhäuser ) , anenvironmentchamber ( EMBLPrecisionEngineering ) andacooled CCD ( charge - coupleddevice ) camera ( RoperScientific ) at37 ◦ Cand5 % CO 2 for6h with5mintimeintervals . Imageacquisitionandmicroscopecontrolwerecarriedout with MetaMorph software ( Molecular Devices ) . The acquired images were analysed using the manual tracking plugin of ImageJ and the Chemotaxis and Migration Tool ( ibidi ) . RGD tension sensor measurements . The molecular tension sensor was adapted from the sensor previously described 39 , with slight modifications to the labelling chemistry . Briefly , the unnatural amino acid used to attach an ATTO647 dye was replaced with a second cysteine to attach an Alexa 647 dye for a higher labelling eﬃciency . This modified molecular tension sensor still presents the RGD ligand derived from FN and does not change the interactions with the cell . Perfusion chambers were attached to PEGylated coverslips as previously described 39 . Briefly , labelled molecular tension sensor ( ∼ 100nM ) was then added to the flow cell and incubated for 30min , followed by Pluronic F - 127 ( 0 . 2 % w / v ) for ∼ 1min to prevent nonspecific cell attachment . All the above steps were preceded by a PBS wash to remove excess reagent from the previous step . The cells were then added and incubated for at least 5h at 37 ◦ C in DMEM high - glucose medium . Images were taken using TIRF microscopy on an inverted microscope ( Nikon Ti - E ) equipped with an Apo TIRF × 100 – numerical aperture 1 . 49 oil immersion objective ( Nikon ) . Data were acquired at 5 frames per second with either an EMCCD camera ( Andor iXon ) or an sCMOS camera ( Hamamatsu Orca Flash ) . For 2D correlation analyses , FL - Kank2 - GFP and FRET images were normalized andmedianfilteredtoreducebackgroundnoise 39 . Thechannelswerethenmanually thresholded to separate adhesions from the background signal and to create masks for each channel . The pixels from both masks were combined into a single mask , whichwasappliedtotheGFPandFRETimages . Wethenusedtheresultingmasked images to calculate the 2D correlation coeﬃcient . Significance was calculated using the Wilcoxon rank sum test . For comparison of average stress within adhesions between cell lines , the force per pixel was calculated using images of the entire cell taken on the Hamamatsu sCMOS camera . The GFP channel was normalized and processed using a moving boxcar average and thresholding . The adhesions were segmented using a watershed algorithm with a minimum adhesion size of 0 . 5 µ m 2 . The average force per µ m 2 for adhesionswasthencalculatedwithanaveragesensordensityonthebasisofpreviouscalibrations 39 . For the adhesion area ratio , each of the pixels from the segmented adhesionswasconvertedtoforceandtheratioofthenumberofpixelsabove1 . 25pN versusbelow1 . 25pNwascalculated . SignificancewascalculatedusingtheWilcoxon rank sum test . RhoA GTPase activity . Indicated cells were serum - starved for 3h and plated on FN for 1h in the absence of serum . Active GTP - bound RhoA was aﬃnity purified and detected with the Active Rho Pull - Down and Detection Kit ( no 16116 , Thermo Scientific ) following manufacturer’s instructions . Statisticsandreproducibility . StatisticalanalysiswascarriedoutinGraphPadPrism software ( version 5 . 00 , GraphPad Software ) . Statistical calculations to predetermine required sample size were not carried out . The data sets with data points above 10 were analysed with the D’Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test . Data sets with normal distributions were analysed with either Student’s t tests to compare two conditions , or with one - way ANOVA Tukey tests to compare multiple conditions . Data sets that did not follow normal distribution in the normality test or those that should not be considered as normal distribution ( for example , TFM measurements ) were analysed with a Kruskal – Wallis test ( multiple comparison ) or Wilcoxon rank sumtest ( two - samplecomparison ) . InthecaseofTFMmeasurements , wecarriedout outlier identification and data cleaning due to apparent defects in some individual measurements . For data with replicates below 10 , we assumed normal distribution on the basis of the appearance of the data and analysed with Student’s two - tailed t test . Results are depicted as mean ± s . d . , mean ± s . e . m . or mean ± 95 % CI as indicated in figure legends . All experiments for quantitative analysis were reproduced at least three times .
