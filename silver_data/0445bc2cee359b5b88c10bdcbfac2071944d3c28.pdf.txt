SUMMARY Inhibition of Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization by PICK1 is a central mechanism to AMPA receptor ( AMPAR ) internalization and long - term depression ( LTD ) , although the signaling pathways that modulate this process in response to NMDA receptor ( NMDAR ) activation are unknown . Here , we deﬁne a function for the GTPase Arf1 in this process . We show that Arf1 - GTP binds PICK1 to limit PICK1 - mediated inhibition of Arp2 / 3 activity . Expression of mutant Arf1 that does not bind PICK1 leads to reduced surface levels of GluA2 - containing AMPARs and smaller spines in hippocampal neurons , which occludes subsequent NMDA - induced AMPAR internalization and spine shrinkage . In organotypic slices , NMDAR - dependent LTD of AMPAR excitatory postsynaptic currents is abolished in neurons expressing mutant Arf1 . Furthermore , NMDAR stimulation downregulates Arf1 activation and binding to PICK1 via the Arf - GAP GIT1 . This study deﬁnes Arf1 as a critical regu - lator of actin dynamics and synaptic function via modulation of PICK1 . INTRODUCTION Long - term synaptic plasticity is thought to underlie learning and memory and is also important for the ﬁne - tuning of neural circuitry during development . AMPA receptors ( AMPARs ) mediate the majority of fast excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain , and plasticity at excitatory synapses involves alter - ations in AMPAR number at the synaptic plasma membrane in processes involving the regulated trafﬁcking of AMPAR - containing vesicles ( Collingridge et al . , 2010 ; Shepherd and Huganir , 2007 ) . The dynamic actin cytoskeleton is central to the regulation of vesicle trafﬁcking by exerting mechanical forces that alter mem - brane geometry ( Kaksonen et al . , 2006 ) . Localized alterations in actin turnover are proposed to provide mechanical forces that contribute to membrane curvature , vesicle scission , and propul - sion of nascent vesicles away from the membrane ( Merriﬁeld , 2004 ) . The molecular machinery and upstream signaling pathways that regulate actin polymerization are therefore of fundamental importance to the control of receptor trafﬁcking and their expression on the cell surface . The Arp2 / 3 complex is the major catalyst for the formation of branched actin networks that mediate membrane remodelling ( Pollard , 2007 ; Stradal and Scita , 2006 ) . Dendritic spines are the sites of excitatory synapses in neurons and are particularly enriched in extremely dynamic ﬁlamentous F - actin , which cycles rapidly between F - actin and globular G - actin ( Star et al . , 2002 ) . The dynamic actin cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in the regulation of AMPAR trafﬁcking that underlies synaptic plasticity ( Cingolani and Goda , 2008 ) ; however , the mechanisms that regulate actin polymerization to control AMPAR trafﬁcking during synaptic plasticity are not well understood . PICK1 is a PDZ - and BAR - domain - containing protein that binds , via the PDZ domain , to AMPAR subunits GluA2 / 3 ( Hanley , 2008 ; Xu and Xia , 2006 ) . PICK1 is required for AMPAR internali - zation in response to Ca 2 + inﬂux via NMDA receptor ( NMDAR ) activation in hippocampal neurons , which underlies the reduc - tion in synaptic strength in long - term depression ( LTD ; Hanley and Henley , 2005 ; Terashima et al . , 2008 ; Volk et al . , 2010 ) . PICK1 - mediated GluA2 trafﬁcking is also a crucial mechanism in cerebellar LTD ( Steinberg et al . , 2006 ; Xia et al . , 2000 ) , indi - cating the central importance of PICK1 in synaptic plasticity . We recently demonstrated that PICK1 directly binds to and in - hibits the actin - nucleating Arp2 / 3 complex and that this plays a central role in AMPAR trafﬁcking , spine shrinkage , and LTD in hippocampal neurons ( Nakamura et al . , 2011 ; Rocca et al . , 2008 ) . How NMDAR activation modulates PICK1 - mediated Arp2 / 3 inhibition to trigger changes in AMPAR trafﬁcking and spine dynamics is unknown .

( legend continued on next page ) Neuron Arf1 Regulates Synaptic Function via PICK1 - Arp2 / 3 294 Neuron 79 , 293 – 307 , July 24 , 2013 ª 2013 The Authors Arp2 / 3 activity , such as N - WASP and WAVE , are effectors for the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac , respectively , and are therefore modulated by signaling pathways directed by these GTPases ( Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ) . PICK1 shows homology to ar - faptin , which binds the related GTPase ADP - ribosylation factor 1 ( Arf1 ) , and it has been suggested that PICK1 interacts with Arf1 in the yeast two - hybrid system ( Takeya et al . , 2000 ) . The functional consequences of this interaction are completely unexplored . The Arf proteins are small guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) - bind - ing proteins that are typically associated with trafﬁcking of mem - brane proteins . Arfs promote vesicle biogenesis by recruiting coat protein complexes such as COPI to the sites of vesicle for - mation ( D’Souza - Schorey and Chavrier , 2006 ; Gillingham and Munro , 2007 ) . More recently , it has become apparent that Arfs can regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics as part of this membrane trafﬁcking process ( Dubois et al . , 2005 ; Myers and Casanova , 2008 ) , although the molecular mechanisms remain unclear , especially in neurons . In this study , we demonstrate that PICK1 is an Arf1 effector , whereby Arf1 signaling modulates the inhibition of Arp2 / 3 - medi - ated actin polymerization by PICK1 in dendritic spines . Via its interaction with PICK1 , Arf1 regulates spine size and the traf - ﬁcking of GluA2 - containing AMPARs in hippocampal neurons . Furthermore , we identify an NMDAR - mediated pathway involving GIT1 , Arf1 , and PICK1 that regulates synaptic function and LTD . RESULTS GTP - Bound Arf1 Binds Directly to PICK1 and Forms a Triple Complex with GluA2 in Neurons To investigate the interaction of PICK1 with Arf1 , we performed GST - PICK1 pull - down assays with a constitutively active mutant of Arf1 ( Arf1Q71L ) or a nucleotide - binding - defective mutant ( Arf1T31N ) expressed in COS cells . GST - PICK1 interacts specif - ically with the constitutively active Arf1Q71L mutant , showing negligible binding to Arf1T31N , suggesting that the PICK1 - Arf1 interaction is GTP dependent ( Figure 1A ) . To test this further , we carried out GST - PICK1 pull - down assays with puriﬁed his 6 - Arf1 in the absence of other proteins and in the presence of either nonhydrolyzable GTP ( GTP g S ) or guanosine diphos - phate ( GDP b S ) . Arf1 binds PICK1 only in the presence of GTP g S , demonstrating a direct GTP - dependent interaction of Arf1 with PICK1 ( Figure 1B ) . To investigate the PICK1 - Arf1 interaction in native tissue , we carried out coimmunoprecipitations ( co - IPs ) from neuronal extracts using PICK1 antibodies in the presence or absence of GTP g S . Arf1 interacts with PICK1 only in the pres - ence of GTP g S , demonstrating that a GTP - dependent PICK1 - Arf1 complex exists in neurons ( Figure 1C ) . The GluA2 - PICK1 interaction is unaffected by the presence of GTP g S ( Figure 1C and Figure S1A available online ) . Since a major function of PICK1 is regulating AMPAR trafﬁcking via an interaction with the GluA2 subunit , we assessed whether PICK1 can complex with both GluA2 and Arf1 simultaneously . Co - IP from cultured neuronal extracts using anti - GluA2 antibodies demonstrates that Arf1 is in a GTP - dependent complex with GluA2 ( Figure 1D ) . The GluA2 - Arf1 complex is disrupted following transduction of neurons with Sindbis virus expressing a peptide ( pep2 - EVKI ) that inhibits AMPAR - PICK1 interactions ( Terashima et al . , 2004 , 2008 ) , demonstrating that Arf1 associates with GluA2 via PICK1 ( Figures 1D and S1B ) . To conﬁrm AMPAR subunit speci - ﬁcity of this interaction , we carried out co - IP experiments from transfected HEK293 cells . Endogenous Arf1 forms a complex with PICK1 ﬂag and myc GluA2 but not myc GluA1 ( Figure S1C ) . To analyze the subcellular distribution of Arf1 , we carried out differential detergent fractionation of synaptosomes prepared from brain tissue . It has previously been shown that PICK1 is pre - sent in synaptosomal fractions as well as PSD fractions I and II but not the core PSD III fraction ( Rocca et al . , 2008 ; Xia et al . , 1999 ) . Arf1 shows a strikingly similar distribution to PICK1 , demonstrating that both proteins are found in the same subcellular fractions , and are both loosely associated with the postsynaptic density ( Figure 1E ) . Arf6 has also been implicated in AMPAR trafﬁcking during LTD ( Scholz et al . , 2010 ) , so we investigated whether this related protein binds PICK1 . GST pull - downs demonstrate that Arf6 does not interact with PICK1 ( Figure 1F ) . Taken together , these results demonstrate that PICK1 binds directly and speciﬁcally to Arf1 in a GTP - dependent ( D ) Arf1interactswithGluA2viaPICK1 .

GTP - Bound Arf1 Regulates Inhibition of Arp2 / 3 - Mediated Actin Polymerization by PICK1 We next investigated which aspect of PICK1 function is regu - lated by the interaction with Arf1 . Since numerous small GTPases regulate actin polymerization via effector proteins , we hypothesized that Arf1 may modulate PICK1 - mediated Arp2 / 3 inhibition . To test this hypothesis , we ﬁrst investigated whether the PICK1 - Arp2 / 3 interaction is regulated by Arf1 . The addition of GTP - bound his 6 - Arf1 to PICK1 - Arp2 / 3 com - plexes results in a signiﬁcant reduction of Arp2 / 3 binding to PICK1 ( Figure 1G ) . To conﬁrm that this effect is speciﬁc for PICK1 , we analyzed Arp2 / 3 binding to two other regulators of actin polymerization , cortactin and coﬁlin . The addition of GTP - bound his 6 Arf1 has no effect on the binding of Arp2 / 3 to these proteins ( Figure S1D ) . A possible explanation for the reduced binding of Arp2 / 3 to PICK1 in the presence of Arf1 is that Arf1 and Arp2 / 3 compete for the same binding site . To test this , we performed the reverse experiment and analyzed Arf1 binding to PICK1 in the presence or absence of the Arp2 / 3 complex . The presence of Arp2 / 3 does not cause a reduction in Arf1 binding to PICK1 ( Figure S1E ) , indicating that Arf1 does not regulate Arp2 / 3 binding by direct competition but rather functions via an allosteric mechanism . We also inves - tigated whether Arf1 regulates the PICK1 - actin interaction ( Rocca et al . , 2008 ) . Arf1 causes a signiﬁcant reduction in actin binding to PICK1 ( Figure S1F ) . An intramolecular interaction between the PICK1 PDZ domain and BAR domain has previ - ously been demonstrated , which inhibits the interactions of PICK1 with the Arp2 / 3 complex and with actin ( Lu and Ziff , 2005 ; Rocca et al . , 2008 ) . To explore the mechanism behind Arf1 inhibition of Arp2 / 3 and actin binding to PICK1 , we investi - gated whether Arf1 modulates this intramolecular interaction . Arf1 - GTP enhances interactions between the PICK1 PDZ domain and BAR domain ( Figure 1H ) . This suggests that GTP - bound Arf1 induces a ‘‘closed’’ conformation of PICK1 , which binds Arp2 / 3 and actin less efﬁciently ( Rocca et al . , 2008 ) . These data strongly suggest that Arf1 can modulate the inhi - bition of Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization by PICK1 . To speciﬁcally test this hypothesis , we employed in vitro actin polymerization assays . These assays use ﬂuorescent pyrene - conjugated actin , which exhibits increased ﬂuorescence upon polymerization . Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization can be stimulated by adding the verprolin / coﬁlin / acidic ( VCA ) domain of the Arp2 / 3 activator N - WASP . While PICK1 inhibits VCA - mediated actin polymerization as previously described ( Rocca et al . , 2008 ) , the addition of GTP - bound Arf1 blocks PICK1 - mediated inhibition of actin polymerization . At half - maximal polymerization , PICK1 alone causes a 44 % inhibition of actin polymerization , whereas in the presence of PICK1 plus GTP - bound Arf1 , actin polymerization is only inhibited by 23 % ( Figure 1I ) . In contrast , guanosine diphosphate ( GDP ) - bound Arf1 has no effect on PICK1 inhibition of Arp2 / 3 activity . This demonstrates that Arf1 can directly inﬂuence actin dynamics in vitro via PICK1 and furthermore that PICK1 is an effector of Arf1 . Arf1 C Terminus Speciﬁcally Binds PICK1 PDZ Domain To investigate the binding site between Arf1 and PICK1 , we carried out co - IPs from transfected COS cells and found that a mutation in the PICK1 PDZ domain ( KD27 , 28AA ; Terashima et al . , 2004 ) abolishes the interaction with Arf1 ( Figure 2A ) . This is consistent with yeast two - hybrid data in a previous report , which also suggested that PICK1 interacts with the C terminus of Arf1 ( Takeya et al . , 2000 ) . We show that in GST pull - down as - says , deletion of the extreme C - terminal four amino acids on Arf1 ( R 178 NQK 181 ) eliminates binding to PICK1 ( Figure 2B ) . In contrast to wild - type ( WT ) - Arf1 , this mutant ( D CT - Arf1 ) has no effect on PICK1 - Arp2 / 3 interactions ( Figure 2C ) or PICK1 - actin interac - tions ( Figure S2A ) . In order to utilize this mutant protein to inves - tigate the role of the Arf1 - PICK1 interaction in neurons , it is important to demonstrate that other properties of Arf1 apart from PICK1 binding are unaffected by deletion of the C - terminal four amino acids . Therefore , we compared the GTP - dependent binding of D CT - Arf1 and WT - Arf1 to a well - established Arf1 effector protein , Golgi - localized gamma - ear - containing Arf - binding protein 3 ( GGA3 ; Myers and Casanova , 2008 ; Nie et al . , 2003 ) . D CT - Arf1 binds the VHS GAT domain of GGA3 in a GTP - dependent manner that is indistinguishable from that of WT - Arf1 ( Figure 2D ) . We also compared the distribution of D CT - Arf1 and WT - Arf1 expressed in neurons , relative to each other and to a range of organelle marker proteins . Coexpression of myc WT - Arf1 and HA D CT - Arf1 demonstrates that the two proteins are identical in their subcellular localization in neuronal dendrites ( Figure S2B ) . Expression of myc WT - Arf1 or HA D CT - Arf1 alone , followed by costaining for the recycling endosome marker Rab11 , indicates that both WT - and D CT - Arf1 are partially localized to recycling endosomes ( Figure S2C ) . WT - and D CT - Arf1 show similar partial colocalization with the postsynaptic density protein Homer , indicating that both WT - and D CT - Arf1 are localized to most , but not all , synapses ( Figure S2D ) . Arf1 has an important function at the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) - Golgi interface ( Dascher and Balch , 1994 ) , so we analyzed colocalization with the Golgi resident protein giantin and the ER marker calreticulin in neuronal cell bodies . Both WT - and D CT - Arf1 show a similar partial overlapping distribution with calreticulin ( Figure S2E ) and weak colocalization with giantin ( Figure S2F ) . Neither construct causes any detectable redistribu - tion of ER or Golgi markers . These experiments show that deletion of the extreme C - termi - nal four amino acids on Arf1 blocks its interaction with PICK1 but has no effect on its GTP - dependent binding to an alternative Arf1 effector protein or on its subcellular localization . Arf1 Regulates Actin Dynamics via PICK1 in Dendritic Spines Our data suggest that Arf1 regulates actin polymerization by modulating PICK1 - mediated Arp2 / 3 inhibition . To test this hy - pothesis in neurons , we analyzed the levels of F - actin in dendritic spines using phalloidin conjugated to Alexa 647 . Spines on neu - rons transfected with a previously characterized small hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) against Arf1 ( Volpicelli - Daley et al . , 2005 ) exhibit signiﬁcantly reduced phalloidin staining compared to controls , which is rescued by coexpression of shRNA - resistant WT - Arf1 but not by D CT - Arf1 ( Figure 3A ) . This suggests that Arf1 Neuron Arf1 Regulates Synaptic Function via PICK1 - Arp2 / 3 296 Neuron 79 , 293 – 307 , July 24 , 2013 ª 2013 The Authors regulates F - actin levels via PICK1 in dendritic spines . F - actin un - dergoes a dynamic process of ‘‘treadmilling , ’’ which involves the addition of actin monomers to the plus end of the ﬁlament and dissociation of monomers from the minus end . Recent studies have demonstrated that F - actin polymerization and depolymer - ization are highly regulated in dendritic spines ( Hotulainen and Hoogenraad , 2010 ) . To investigate this dynamic process , we used Lifeact - GFP , which binds F - actin in live cells , in conjunction with ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) anal - ysis . Expression of Lifeact - GFP in cultured hippocampal neu - rons results in a strong ﬂuorescence signal in dendritic spine heads , consistent with the high levels of endogenous F - actin in spines ( Figure S3B ) . FRAP of spine - localized Lifeact - GFP can be attributed to the formation of new F - actin and hence is a measure of endogenous actin turnover . To conﬁrm that FRAP of Lifeact - GFP in spines is not the result of simple diffusion of ﬂuorescent Lifeact - GFP through the spine neck and / or ex - change with bleached Lifeact - GFP on existing actin ﬁlaments , we stabilized actin ﬁlaments using jasplakinolide and carried out FRAP analysis on Lifeact - GFP - expressing spines . Figures 3B and 3C show that under control conditions , ﬂuorescence levels recover quite rapidly with t 1 / 2 = 14 . 9 ± 2 . 4 s . Jasplakinolide application dramatically slows the recovery , resulting in t 1 / 2 = 250 ± 31 s . The minimal recovery that persists under conditions in which actin ﬁlaments are stabilized is likely to represent a small amount of exchange of bleached Lifeact - GFP and ﬂuorescent Lifeact - GFP on existing actin ﬁlaments . This important control experiment demonstrates that the vast majority of the FRAP recovery can be attributed to dynamic actin turnover in the spine . To investigate the role of Arf1 in actin dynamics , we carried out Lifeact - GFP FRAP analysis on dendritic spines expressing Arf1 shRNA . Spines of similar size and morphology were selected for all conditions . Arf1 knockdown results in a signiﬁcantly slower recovery compared to controls ( Figures 3D , 3E , and S3C ) , suggesting a role for Arf1 in regulating actin turnover in dendritic spines . Coexpression of shRNA - resistant WT - Arf1 rescues the knockdown phenotype to control levels , whereas shRNA - resis - tant D CT - Arf1 does not rescue ( Figures 3D , 3E , and S3C ) , sug - gesting that Arf1 - PICK1 interactions regulate actin turnover in dendritic spines . To further support a role for Arf1 in regulating actin dynamics speciﬁcally via PICK1 , we investigated the effect of Arf1 knock - down with PICK1 expression also knocked down . Lifeact - GFP FRAP analysis on dendritic spines expressing PICK1 shRNA indicates that PICK1 knockdown slows recovery , suggesting a reduction in the rate of actin turnover ( Figures 3F , 3G , and S3D ) . Under conditions of reduced PICK1 expression , Arf1 knockdown has no effect on the rate of actin turnover ( Figures 3F , 3G , and S3D ) . These results demonstrate that Arf1 regulates actin dynamics via PICK1 in dendritic spines . Arf1 - PICK1 Interactions Regulate GluA2 Trafﬁcking Since PICK1 - Arp2 / 3 interactions are involved in AMPAR trafﬁcking ( Rocca et al . , 2008 ) , we examined whether Arf1 can regulate this process via PICK1 . To test this hypothesis , we analyzed the effect of removing the Arf1 - dependent Figure 2 . Characterization of PICK1 - Arf1 Binding Mutant ( A ) Arf1 interacts with the PDZ domain of PICK1 .

While surface GluA2 in WT - Arf1 - overexpressing cells is indistin - guishable from controls , expression of D CT - Arf1 causes a marked reduction in surface GluA2 ( Figure 4A ) . Total levels of GluA2 expression were unaffected by WT - or D CT - Arf1 expres - sion ( Figure S4A ) . To strengthen the conclusion that this is a PICK1 - mediated effect , we exploited the observation that PICK1 requires synaptic activity to inﬂuence AMPAR trafﬁcking and stimulate GluA2 internalization ( Hanley and Henley , 2005 ; Nakamura et al . , 2011 ; Terashima et al . , 2008 ) . Blockade of synaptic activity using TTX completely abolishes the D CT - Arf1 - induced reduction in surface GluA2 ( Figure S4B ) . The importance of the Arf1 C terminus and synaptic activity in these experiments strongly suggests that Arf1 inhibits PICK1 - medi - ated trafﬁcking of GluA2 - containing AMPARs from the cell sur - face . To provide further support for this model , we investigated the effect of D CT - Arf1 under conditions of reduced PICK1 expression . PICK1 shRNA causes an increase in surface GluA2 , as shown previously ( Citri et al . , 2010 ; Sossa et al . , 2006 ) , and completely blocks the effect of D CT - Arf1 expression ( Figure 4B ) . This demonstrates that Arf1 regulates GluA2 surface expression via PICK1 . We explored the speciﬁcity of this effect and found that D CT - Arf1 does not affect surface expression of AMPAR subunit GluA1 ( Figure 4C ) or transferrin receptors ( Figure S4C ) . These experiments show that the mechanism involving PICK1 - Arf1 interactions is speciﬁc to the AMPAR subunit GluA2 and pro - vide evidence that D CT - Arf1 expression has no effect on gen - eral trafﬁcking events in neurons . Since Arf1 has important functions at the ER - Golgi interface ( Dascher and Balch , 1994 ) , we investigated the possibility that the observed effect of D CT - Arf1 on surface - expressed GluA2 could be a result of perturbations to trafﬁcking at the ER . Importantly , neither WT - Arf1 nor D CT - Arf1 expression alters ER exit of GluA2 ( Figure S4D ) , suggesting that forward trafﬁc through the ER is unaffected by D CT - Arf1 . Figure 3 .

Neuron Arf1 Regulates Synaptic Function via PICK1 - Arp2 / 3 298 Neuron 79 , 293 – 307 , July 24 , 2013 ª 2013 The Authors To further analyze the role of Arf1 in GluA2 trafﬁcking , we knocked down endogenous Arf1 expression using shRNA . Arf1 knockdown leads to a dramatic decrease in surface levels of GluA2 - containing AMPARs ( Figure 4D ) , consistent with a role for Arf1 in blocking PICK1 - mediated internalization of GluA2 under basal conditions . Neurons cotransfected with Arf1 shRNA and shRNA - resistant WT - Arf1 exhibit rescued levels of surface GluA2 comparable with the control . How - ever , cotransfection with shRNA - resistant D CT - Arf1 does not rescue the shRNA - induced reduction in surface GluA2 ( Figure 4D ) . We also used lentivirus to express Arf1 shRNA and shRNA - resistant Arf1 in neuronal cultures that were sub - jected to surface biotinylation to analyze GluA2 surface expression . The results are similar to the immunocytochem - istry ; Arf1 shRNA causes a reduction in surface GluA2 , which is rescued by shRNA - resistant WT - Arf1 but not D CT - Arf1 ( Figure S4E ) . To assess the functional signiﬁcance of the selective reduc - tion in surface GluA2 , we analyzed AMPAR - mediated synaptic transmission using whole - cell patch - clamp electrophysiolog - ical recordings in organotypic slices . We measured AMPAR excitatory postsynaptic currents ( EPSCs ) at three holding potentials ( (cid:1) 70 mV , 0 mV , and + 40 mV ) and calculated the rectiﬁcation index ( RI ) as the ratio of the slope 0 to + 40 mV and (cid:1) 70 to 0 mV . Hence , RI < 1 corresponds to increased inward rectiﬁcation . As expected , AMPAR EPSCs in nontrans - fected neurons show no detectable rectiﬁcation , suggesting that most synaptic AMPARs contain GluA2 subunits . WT - Arf1 overexpression has no effect on RI , consistent with its lack of effect on GluA2 surface expression . In contrast , expression Figure 4 .

To assess the consequences of this alteration in AMPAR sub - unit composition for synaptic strength , we recorded EPSCs from transfected and nearby nontransfected neurons ( in many cases simultaneously ) in response to the same synaptic stimulus . Neither AMPAR nor NMDAR EPSC amplitude are affected by WT - Arf1 or D CT - Arf1 expression ( Figures S4F and S4G ) , indi - cating that net synaptic strength is maintained constant following the replacement of some GluA2 - containing AMPARs with GluA2 - lacking AMPARs . Since the inhibition of Arp2 / 3 activity by PICK1 is a central mechanism of NMDA - stimulated AMPA receptor internalization ( Rocca et al . , 2008 ) , we asked whether modulation of PICK1 by Arf1 is involved in this process . We used a ‘‘chemical LTD’’ protocol where NMDARs are activated by bath application of NMDA to promote AMPAR internalization , which is analyzed by antibody - feeding immunocytochemistry ( Beattie et al . , 2000 ) . Control neurons show an approximately 2 - fold increase in GluA2 internalization in response to NMDA treatment , which is unaffected by overexpression of WT - Arf1 . However , in neu - Figure 5 .

A possible explanation for this result is that D CT - Arf1 interferes with the PICK1 - GluA2 interaction . GluA2 - PICK1 co - IPs are unaffected by the presence of D CT - Arf1 , demon - strating that this is not the case ( Figure S5 ) . Taken together , these data indicate that D CT - Arf1 expression causes GluA2 internalization under basal conditions , which occludes further AMPAR inter - nalization in response to NMDA treat - ment . This suggests a model in which Arf1 limits PICK1 - mediated internali - zation of surface GluA2 - containing AMPAR and removal of this inhibitory drive is part of the mechanism involved in NMDA - induced AMPAR internalization . Arf1 - PICK1 Interactions Regulate NMDAR - Dependent LTD To more directly explore the role of the PICK1 - Arf1 interaction in synaptic plasticity , we carried out electrophysiological recordings from CA1 pyramidal cells in organotypic slices , and a low - frequency stimulation pairing protocol was used to induce NMDAR - dependent LTD ( Figure 6 ) . Reliable LTD of AMPAR EPSCs can be induced in control nontransfected cells ( Figure 6A ) aswellasincellsoverexpressingWT - Arf1 ( Figure6C ) . Incontrast , LTD is completely absent in D CT - Arf1 - expressing neurons ( Figure 6E ) , consistent with the AMPAR internalization assays shown in Figure 5 . To investigate the speciﬁcity of this effect , we also tested NMDAR - dependent LTD of pharmacologically isolated NMDAR EPSCs . The same LTD protocol successfully inducesarobustreductioninNMDAREPSCsincontrolcells ( Fig - ure 6B ) , which is unaffected by WT - Arf1 expression ( Figure 6D ) and D CT - Arf1 expression ( Figure 6F ) , providing additional evi - dence that D CT - Arf1 does not interfere with other neuronal traf - ﬁcking or intracellular signaling pathways . As a further test for speciﬁcity , we investigated a form of mGluR - dependent LTD that is triggered by the application of dihydroxyphenylglycine Neuron Arf1 Regulates Synaptic Function via PICK1 - Arp2 / 3 300 Neuron 79 , 293 – 307 , July 24 , 2013 ª 2013 The Authors ( DHPG ; Palmer et al . , 1997 ) . Application of the group 1 mGluR agonist DHPG results in a robust LTD of AMPAR EPSCs , which is unaffected by either WT - Arf1 or D CT - Arf1 expression ( Fig - ure 6G ) . This is consistent with a previous report suggesting that PICK1 is not involved in mGluR - LTD in the hippocampus ( Citri et al . , 2010 ) . These experiments demonstrate that the interaction between Arf1 and PICK1 is speciﬁcally involved in NMDAR - dependent LTD of AMPAR EPSCs ( Figure 6H ) . Arf1 Regulates Dendritic Spine Size via PICK1 Since PICK1 restricts spine size via inhibition of the Arp2 / 3 com - plex ( Nakamura et al . , 2011 ) , we investigated whether Arf1 can modulate dendritic spine size via PICK1 . While dendritic spines in WT - Arf1 - overexpressing cells are indistinguishable from con - trols , expression of D CT - Arf1 causes a marked reduction in the size of spines ( Figure 7A ) . This strongly suggests that Arf1 bind - ing to PICK1 modulates dendritic spine size under basal condi - tions . Expression of neither protein affects the density of spines on dendrites ( Figure 7A ) . To provide further evidence that Arf1 functions via PICK1 to regulate spine size , we examined the ef - fect of D CT - Arf1 under conditions of reduced PICK1 expression . Neurons transfected with PICK1 shRNA have signiﬁcantly larger spines compared to controls , as shown previously ( Bassani et al . , 2012 ; Nakamura et al . , 2011 ) .

As well as regulating basal spine size , PICK1 is required for spine shrinkage during chemical LTD ( Nakamura et al . , 2011 ) ; therefore , we examined the effect of Arf1 on this process . As shown in Figure 7A , D CT - Arf1 causes a reduction in spine size , which is similar to the shrinkage observed in response to NMDAR activation during chemical LTD ( Figure 7C ) . We therefore investigated whether these treatments occlude each other . In agreement with this hypothesis , NMDAR activa - tion has no effect on spine size in neurons expressing D CT - Arf1 ( Figure 7C ) , suggesting that NMDA - induced spine shrinkage involves the Arf1 - PICK1 pathway . In contrast , NMDA - induced spine shrinkage is unaffected by WT - Arf1 overexpression . NMDAR activation does not affect the density of spines on den - drites within the time period tested here , as shown previously ( Figure 7C ; Nakamura et al . , 2011 ) . These results demonstrate a crucial role for Arf1 - PICK1 interactions in maintaining dendritic spine size and suggest that Arf1 restricts spine shrinkage via interaction with PICK1 . Arf1 Activation Is Regulated by NMDAR Stimulation Since LTD expression involves AMPAR internalization and spine shrinkage , both of which are inhibited by Arf1 under basal conditions , this blockade by Arf1 must be removed during LTD induction . To test this , we investigated whether NMDAR stimu - lation affects the PICK1 - Arf1 interaction by carrying out co - IPs from cultured neuronal extracts following chemical LTD . A crosslinking protocol ( see Experimental Procedures ) was uti - lized to preserve native complexes , which would otherwise dissociate after lysis in the absence of GTP g S . Activating NMDARs leads to a signiﬁcant decrease in the PICK1 - Arf1 inter - action compared to untreated cells ( Figure 8A ) . Since Arf1 binds PICK1 in a GTP - dependent manner , we asked whether the reduction in Arf1 binding was due to a decreased proportion of activated ( GTP - bound ) Arf1 following NMDAR stimulation . Pull - down assays were performed using the VHS - GAT domain of GGA3 to monitor levels of activated Arf1 in extracts from NMDA - treated cultured neurons . Following bath application of NMDA , there is a transient decrease of around 60 % in levels of activated Arf1 at 7 min after the initial NMDA application ( Figure 8B ) . These experiments demonstrate that NMDAR acti - vation inhibits PICK1 - Arf1 interactions by reducing Arf1 - GTP levels on a timescale that is consistent with that of AMPAR internalization during chemical LTD ( Ashby et al . , 2004 ) . The activation state of small GTPases is regulated by GEFs , which exchange GDP for GTP , hence switching the protein ‘‘on , ’’ and GAPs , which stimulate the catalysis of GTP to GDP , switching the protein ‘‘off . ’’ Our data suggest that a GAP may be recruited to deactivate Arf1 in response to NMDA treatment . GIT1 is an Arf GAP that has been shown to play a role in both AMPAR traf - ﬁcking and dendritic spine morphogenesis ( Ko et al . , 2003 ; Zhang et al . , 2003 ) . Therefore , we investigated whether GIT1 regulates Arf1 activation during chemical LTD . We used GST - Arf1 pull - downs to investigate Arf1 - GIT1 binding in response to NMDAR stimulation . Figure 8C shows that GIT1 binding to GST - Arf1 increases signiﬁcantly following NMDA application , suggesting that GIT1 regulates Arf1 in response to NMDAR stim - ulation . To directly test the role of GIT1 in NMDA - induced Arf1 deactivation , we used small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) to knock down GIT1 expression in cultured neurons and analyzed GTP - Arf1 levels by pull - down assays using the VHS - GAT domain of GGA3 . GIT1 knockdown blocks the NMDA - induced reduction in Arf1 - GTP levels ( Figure 8D ) . In addition , GIT1 knockdown causes an increase in GTP - Arf1 under basal conditions , indi - cating that GIT1 is tonically active in neurons to regulate Arf1 activation ( Figure 8D ) . These results demonstrate that GIT1 is critical for Arf1 deacti - vation during chemical LTD . DISCUSSION Here , we describe a mechanism by which Arf1 regulates actin dynamics and membrane trafﬁcking via an interaction with PICK1 . We show that activated Arf1 directly binds PICK1 to block the inhibition of Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization . Under basal conditions of synaptic activity , GTP - bound Arf1 suppresses PICK1 - mediated inhibition of Arp2 / 3 activity , limiting spine shrinkage and AMPAR internalization . Following NMDAR stimulation , Arf1 is deactivated by the ArfGAP GIT1 , allowing PICK1 to inhibit Arp2 / 3 activity and consequently promote AM - PAR internalization and contribute to spine shrinkage , which are crucial aspects of LTD expression ( Figure S6 ) . Disruption of this pathway by Arf1 knockdown or expression of the PICK1 nonbinding mutant of Arf1 leads to a slowing of actin turnover in dendritic spines , spine shrinkage , and internalization of surface - expressed GluA2 - containing AMPARs . The reduction in surface GluA2 levels and spine size following the loss of Arf1 - dependent inhibitory drive on PICK1 occludes subsequent NMDAR - dependent AMPAR internalization and spine shrinkage . Arf1 - Regulated AMPAR Trafﬁcking and Synaptic Plasticity Our data show that the expression of D CT - Arf1 causes a PICK1 - dependent loss of surface GluA2 and consequent expression of inwardly rectifying synaptic AMPARs by removing the Arf1 - dependent inhibitory drive on PICK1 . LTD involves the internalization of a pool of GluA2 that is regulated by PICK1 ( Hanley and Henley , 2005 ; Terashima et al . , 2008 ) . Therefore , our observations can be explained by a model in which D CT - Arf1 expression causes GluA2 trafﬁcking events that occlude subsequent NMDAR - mediated internalization of GluA2 - contain - ing AMPARs during LTD . The pool of GluA2 - containing AMPARs internalized as a result of D CT - Arf1 expression is pre - sumably the same pool of GluA2 that would be internalized dur - ing LTD , given their mutual dependence on endogenous PICK1 .

Neuron Arf1 Regulates Synaptic Function via PICK1 - Arp2 / 3 Neuron 79 , 293 – 307 , July 24 , 2013 ª 2013 The Authors 303 However , the lack of effect of D CT - Arf1 on AMPAR - EPSC amplitude indicates that there is a compensatory mechanism that keeps synaptic strength constant . The observed rectiﬁca - tion change suggests that this is due to the replacement of GluA2 - containing AMPARs with GluA2 - lacking AMPARs . Consistent with this hypothesis , PICK1 overexpression also causes a reduction in surface GluA2 and inward rectiﬁcation ( Nakamura et al . , 2011 ; Terashima et al . , 2004 ) . This is associ - ated with an increase in AMPAR - EPSC amplitude because of the insertion of a large number of high - conductance GluA2 - lacking AMPARs . As expected , the effect of PICK1 overexpres - sion is greater than that of D CT - Arf1 , which increases the activity of endogenous PICK1 . The difference in PICK1 activity under these two sets of conditions can explain the differences in the level of rectiﬁcation and also the extent to which the AMPAR - EPSC amplitude is altered . For D CT - Arf1 , our observa - tions are most compatible with a mechanism in which the internalization of GluA2 - containing AMPAR is balanced by the incorporation of a smaller number of higher - conductance GluA2 - lacking AMPARs . Therefore , we conclude that there is an occlusion of part of the LTD machinery , speciﬁcally activa - tion of PICK1 , to inhibit the Arp2 / 3 complex and hence drive GluA2 internalization . We see no effect of WT - Arf1 overexpression on actin dynamics , AMPAR trafﬁcking , LTD , or spine morphology . A likely explanation for this is that absolute levels of Arf1 are not a limiting factor , but instead the activities of upstream regulators ( e . g . , the ArfGAP GIT1 ) are the major inﬂuence . Therefore , increasing the absolute levels of WT - Arf1 by overexpression has no effect without modulation of GAP or GEF activity . Arf1 Regulates Actin Polymerization via Its Effector Protein PICK1 In dendritic spines , Arf1 knockdown or D CT - Arf1 expression leads to reduced density of actin ﬁlaments and slower F - actin turnover . The most straightforward explanation for this result is that removing the inhibitory inﬂuence of Arf1 on PICK1 permits PICK1 - mediated inhibition of Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymeriza - tion . Since PICK1 inhibits Arp2 / 3 activity , PICK1 knockdown might be expected to increase the rate of actin turnover as a result of increased Arp2 / 3 activity . However , we show that PICK1 knockdown slows actin turnover . This is similar to the effect of coﬁlin knockdown ( also known as actin depolymerizing factor , or ADF ) reported previously ( Hotulainen et al . , 2009 ) . Coﬁlin causes depolymerization of actin ﬁlaments , yet coﬁlin knockdown leads to a slowing of actin turnover in dendritic spines . This can be explained by a depleted pool of available G - actin when actin dynamics are shifted in favor of F - actin , which would occur under conditions of reduced PICK1 or coﬁlin expression . Importantly , the effect of Arf1 knockdown on actin Figure 8 .

Neuron Arf1 Regulates Synaptic Function via PICK1 - Arp2 / 3 304 Neuron 79 , 293 – 307 , July 24 , 2013 ª 2013 The Authors dynamics is blocked by PICK1 shRNA , indicating that this effect of Arf1 is mediated by PICK1 . Our in vitro data show that Arf1 blocks inhibition of Arp2 / 3 activity by PICK1 . We propose that the mechanism behind this blockade involves an Arf1 - induced conformational change in PICK1 to enhance the PDZ - BAR domain intramolecular interac - tion leading to a ‘‘closed’’ conformation of PICK1 , which reduces its subsequent binding to and inhibition of the actin - nucleation machinery ( Rocca et al . , 2008 ) . Arf1 binds the PDZ domain of PICK1 ; however , Arf1 does not compete with GluA2 for PICK1 interactions . This suggests that Arf1 does not bind to the canon - ical PDZ domain carboxylate loop but has a distinct binding site within the PDZ domain . This hypothesis is supported by the Arf1 C - terminal sequence , which does not conform to any known consensus PDZ domain binding motif ( Harris and Lim , 2001 ) . It is becoming increasingly apparent that Arf proteins have important functions in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton ( Myers and Casanova , 2008 ) . Previous reports have focused on the indirect effects of Arf1 on signaling pathways controlled by small Rho - family GTPases . For example , Arf1 - dependent recruit - ment of COPI at the Golgi leads to Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin poly - merization via a pathway involving the Arf1 - activated Cdc42 GAP ARHGAP10 and consequent recruitment of the Cdc42 effector N - WASP ( Dubois et al . , 2005 ) . In contrast , in the mechanism described here , Arf1 modulatesthe activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex by direct binding to the Arp2 / 3 inhibitor PICK1 , deﬁning PICK1 as an Arf1 effector . Therefore , this mechanism does not rely on Rho GTPase signaling pathways and represents an alternative pathway for regulating actin polymerization . Since GTP - bound Arf1 blocks the inhibition of Arp2 / 3 activity by PICK1 , our model is consistent with the hypothesis that activated Arf1 is a positive regulator of actin polymerization ( Dubois et al . , 2005 ; Heuvingh et al . , 2007 ; Myers and Casanova , 2008 ) . In conclusion , this study identiﬁes an important role for Arf1 in neurons distinct from its well - established role as a regulator of vesicle trafﬁcking in the Golgi . Arf1 signaling regulates Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization via an effector protein , PICK1 , to control AMPAR trafﬁcking and dendritic spine size . Further - more , it deﬁnes an important signaling pathway whereby NMDAR activation leads to activation of GIT1 , which inhibits Arf1 and thereby activates PICK1 to inhibit Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization , a process that is required for AMPAR internalization during LTD . Since the dynamic actin cytoskeleton is essential to the control of a number of processes in cell biology , it is possible that the GIT1 - Arf1 - PICK1 - Arp2 / 3 pathway may be a pivotal mechanism for regulating actin polymerization in other processes related to neuronal function .

Paraformaldehyde crosslinking has been shown not only to promote stabilization of transient protein - protein interactions in close proximity to each other but also to allow stringent conditions during cell lysis to minimize false positives . Moreover , formaldehyde crosslinks are reversible during sample preparation for SDS - PAGE by boiling in Laemmli buffer ( Klockenbusch and Kast , 2010 ) . Preparation of Recombinant Proteins His 6 and GST fusions were expressed and puriﬁed essentially as described previously in Rocca et al . ( 2008 ) . GST Pull - Down Assays Pull - down assays were conducted as described in Rocca et al . ( 2008 ) . Actin Polymerization Assays Polymerization reactions were carried out essentially as described in Rocca et al . ( 2008 ) . Primary Neuronal Cultures AllexperimentswereperformedinaccordancewithHomeOfﬁceguidelinesas directed by the Home Ofﬁce Licensing Team at the University of Bristol . Rat embryonic hippocampal neuronal cultures were prepared from E18 Wistar rats using standard procedures . The culture mediumwas Neurobasal medium ( Gibco ) supplemented with B27 ( Gibco ) and 2 mM glutamine . Neurons were transfected with plasmid DNA at days in vitro ( DIV ) 11 – 13 ( unless other - wise stated ) using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) and used for experiments 4 – 6 days later or with siRNA at DIV 7 – 8 using RNAiMAX ( Invitrogen ) and used for experiments 6 – 8 days later . Immunocytochemistry For surface staining of AMPARs , neurons were treated with or without 1 m M TTX for 1 hr , ﬁxed in 4 % paraformaldehyde plus 4 % sucrose ( PFA ) for 5min , andthenlabeledwithanti - AMPARsubunitantibodiesfollowedbystain - ing with mouse - anti Cy3 secondaries . For antibody feeding experiments , live hippocampal neurons ( DIV 15 – 20 ) were surface labeled with anti - GluA2 ( Milli - pore ) antibodiesfor 30min atroom temperature inHBS in theabsence of TTX . Neurons were then washed in HBS and treated with 50 m M NMDA for 3 min at 37 (cid:3) C followed by a 10 min chase without drugs . Neurons were ﬁxed for 5 min with PFA and stained with anti - mouse Cy5 secondaries . After a20 minﬁxation in PFA , cells were permeabilized and stained with anti - mouse Cy3 second - aries . Images were acquired on a LSM510 confocal microscope ( Zeiss ) and analyzed using NIH Image J . Internalization index was calculated by dividing the value corresponding to internalized staining by the value corresponding to total staining ( internalized + surface ) . The GFP signal was used as a mask , and the average ﬂuorescence intensity was measured within this area . For whole - cell staining , neurons were ﬁxed for 20 min in PFA , per - meabilized , and incubated with antibodies or with phalloidin conjugated to Alexa 647 . Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching Neurons transfected with Lifeact - GFP constructs as speciﬁed were imaged at 37 (cid:3) C in HBS buffer using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope ( Figures 3B – 3EandS3C ) oraPerkinElmerUltraviewspinningdiscmicroscope ( Figures 3F , 3G , and S3D ) . Image conditions were optimized to minimize photobleach - inginducedbytime - lapseimaging . Bleaching wasachieved atmaximumlaser transmission at 488 nm for less than 30 s and targeted to predeﬁned circular regions of interest ( ROIs ) of approximately 3 m m radius corresponding to indi - vidual spines of similar size and morphology . Following bleaching , images were automatically acquired at 5 s intervals , unless otherwise stated . Back - groundﬂuorescencewassubtractedforeachframeduringtheimageprocess - ing to quantify the recovery . Recovery at time point t was calculated as ROI / REF , where ROI is intensity at the region of interest and REF corresponds to intensity of a ‘‘reference’’ nearby spine to account for minor focus changes during acquisition . Recovery values were normalized to the average intensity of ﬁve prebleach frames . Exponential ﬁt to simple regression curves was performed with Sigmaplot software . Values were ﬁt to the equation Neuron Arf1 Regulates Synaptic Function via PICK1 - Arp2 / 3 Neuron 79 , 293 – 307 , July 24 , 2013 ª 2013 The Authors 305 y = y 0 + a ( 1 (cid:1) exp ( (cid:1) bx ) ) , where y 0 , a , and bare offset , maximum value , and time constant , respectively . To optimize the ﬁt , all curves analyzed were con - strained to reach the maximum value of recovery ( a + y0 ) , deﬁned as the average of the last three values . The equation t 1 / 2 = ln ( 0 . 5 ) / (cid:1) b was used to extract half - life of recovery , and conditions were compared using a t test . Electrophysiology Organotypic slices were prepared from P8 Wistar rats using the interface method ( Bortolottoetal . , 2011 ; Stoppinietal . , 1991 ) . Transverse hippocampal slices ( 400 m m ) were placed on Millicell culture plate inserts ( Millipore ) and maintained at 35 (cid:3) C , 5 % CO 2 in MEM - based culture media containing 20 % horse serum and ( in mM ) : 30 HEPES , 16 . 25 glucose , 5 NaHCO 3 , 1 CaCl 2 , 2 MgSO 4 , 0 . 68 ascorbic acid , and 1 m g / ml insulin ( pH 7 . 28 ) , 320 mOsm . Biolistic transfection was performed using a Helios GeneGun ( Bio - Rad ) and electrophysiological recordings were performed , blind with respect to the transfected plasmid ( either WT - Arf1 - IRES - EGFP or D CT - Arf1 - IRES - EGFP together with mCherry ) , 2 – 4 days later . Whole - cell voltage - clamp recordings were made from CA1 pyramidal cells ( Vh = (cid:1) 70 mV ) at 6 – 11 DIV . Patch pipettes contained ( in mM ) 115 Cs - methanesulfonate , 20 CsCl , 10 HEPES , 2 . 5 MgCl 2 , 4 Na 2 ATP , 0 . 4 Na 3 GTP , 10 sodium phosphocreatine , and 0 . 6 EGTA or alternatively 8 NaCl , 130 Cs - methanesulfonate , 10 HEPES , 0 . 5 EGTA , 4 MgATP , 0 . 3 Na 3 GTP , and 5 QX - 314 ( pH 7 . 25 , 290 mOsm ) . Picro - toxin ( 50 – 100 m M ) and 2 - chloroadenosine ( 1 – 2 m M ) were routinely included in the bath solution ( 124 mM NaCl , 3 mM KCl , 26 mM NaHCO 3 , 1 . 4 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 4 mM CaCl 2 , 4 mM MgSO 4 , 10 mM glucose ; saturated with 95 % O 2 / 5 % CO 2 ) . Bath temperature was maintained at 25 (cid:3) C – 28 (cid:3) C . In order to isolate NMDA EPSCs , 3 m M NBQX was added and Vh = (cid:1) 40 mV ; in some cases , D - AP5 ( 50 m M ) was added to conﬁrm that synaptic responses were NMDAR mediated . When measuring RI , 100 m M spermine was added to the intracellular solution in order to prevent dilution of cytoplasmic polyamines and 50 – 100 m M AP5 was added to the bath solution . RI was calculated as the ratio of the slope 0 – 40 mV and (cid:1) 70 to 0 mV ; the average EPSC ( (cid:1) 70 mV ) was averaged with the one following the depolarization period . TwostimulatingelectrodeswereplacedintheSchaffercollateral - commissural pathway and stimulated at 0 . 05 – 0 . 1 Hz to record AMPAR EPSCs and at 0 . 03 Hz for NMDAR EPSCs . When investigating mGluR - LTD , L - 689 , 560 ( 5 m M ) was added to the bath solution and ( S ) - 3 , 5 - DHPG ( 100 m M ) was bath applied for 5 min . Data were acquired and analyzed with WinLTP ( Anderson and Collingridge , 2007 ) . Average amplitudes of EPSCs over a period of 5 min immediately before and 25 min after LTD were considered to determine the magnitude of LTD . Statistical analysis was performed using the Student’s t test or one - way ANOVA as appropriate , and signiﬁcance was set at p < 0 . 05 .
