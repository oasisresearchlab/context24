While much effort has been made to analytically decouple these combined effects of pure diffusion and chemical reaction , it is difficult to attribute the measured quantities to the nature of specific domains of the probed proteins particularly if , as is often the case , the protein has multiple domains to independently interact with the same types but different molecules . Motivated by the common goal in cell signaling research aimed at identifying the protein domains responsible for particular intermolecular interactions , here we describe a new approach to determining the domain - level reaction and pure diffusion properties . To validate this methodology , we apply it to transgelin - 2 , an actin - binding protein whose intracellular dynamics remains elusive . We develop a fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) - based framework , in which comprehensive combinations of domain - deletion mutants are created with genetic engineering , and the difference among the mutants in FRAP response is analyzed . We demonstrate that transgelin - 2 in cells interacts with F - actin via two separate domains , and the chemical equilibrium constant of the interaction is determined at the individual domain levels . Its pure diffusion properties independent of the association to F - actin is also obtained . This approach requires some effort to construct the mutants , but instead enables in situ domain - level determination of the physicochemical properties , which will be useful , as specifically shown here for transgelin - 2 , in addressing the signaling mechanism of cellular proteins . Keywords : Actin - binding proteins · Equilibrium constant · Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching · Reaction - diffusion system · Stress fibers · Transgelin - 2 Introduction Proteins undergo repeated association and dissociation to their partner proteins in cells , a universal event called “turnover” ( Smith et al . 2013 ) . Because of this physicochemical interaction among proteins , their transport within cells is dominated not only by the Brownian motion - based pure diffusion but also by the molecular turnover . The pure diffusion of particles is characterized by the diffusion coefficient (cid:0) (cid:2) (cid:4)(cid:5) (cid:0) (cid:6) 4(cid:8)⁄ where (cid:4)(cid:5) (cid:0) (cid:6) is the mean square displacement ( MSD ) over time (cid:8) . The extent of the association and dissociation of proteins is typically characterized by the association rate (cid:10) (cid:2)(cid:3) and dissociation rate (cid:10) (cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:4) . Pure diffusion corresponds to a case where (cid:10) (cid:2)(cid:3) (cid:2) 0 , but in reality the intracellular diffusion of proteins is more or less affected by the binding to other molecules , and thus it is not straightforward to decouple the mixed effects within cells into each of the inherent reaction and diffusion properties specific to the proteins . One possible way to circumvent the above issue might be evaluating the association and dissociation rates in vitro by using , for example , the stopped - flow method ( e . g . , Goldmann and Isenberg 1993 ; Hundt et al . 2016 ) . However , the reaction rates measured in extracellular environments are not always consistent with those in cells particularly because there are in general kinetic competitions among multiple proteins , while it is hard to accurately mimic the intracellular milieu in in vitro experiments . Besides , a specific protein of interest may form a complex with other molecules , which can significantly alter the kinetic properties ( Nakorchevsky et al . 2010 ; Matsui et al . 2018 ) . To instead directly characterize the kinetics of proteins within cells , a microscopic technique called fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) is often used , in which the temporal evolution of fluorescence - labeled proteins is analyzed during the bleaching and recovery ( Blonk et al . 1993 ; Daddysman and Fecko 2013 ) . The fluorescence recovery curve is often fitted by single / double exponential functions , and then the recovery rate is determined from the inverse of the characteristic time constant ( Campbell and Knight 2007 ; Sakurai - Yageta et al . 2015 ; Dukic et al . 2017 ) . Otherwise , more elaborate physical models have been employed to separately evaluate the reaction - diffusion properties of proteins in cells ( Sprague et al . 2006 ; Mueller et al . 2008 ) . However , the interpretation of the model output could be complicated if the probed protein has , as is often the case , multiple domains that are independently able to interact with the same types but different molecules . Particularly in the field of cell signaling research , it is essential to identify which domains within the individual proteins are responsible for specific intermolecular interactions . Thus , it is hard in conventional approaches to attribute the measured mixed kinetics to the nature of specific domains of the probed proteins . Another drawback of previous approaches is that , to estimate reaction - free pure diffusion properties within cells , the biologically inert green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) is often employed as a substitute of a target protein , but the molecular weight that affects the diffusion may not necessarily be close to that of the actual one . Here we present an alternative approach to determining the pure diffusion properties and intracellular kinetics of actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) . To validate the methodology , we apply it to transgelin - 2 ( Leung et al . 2011 ; Na et al . 2015 ; Kim et al . 2018 ) – a 22 - kDa ABP and also known as smooth muscle protein 22 β or SM22 β – whose intracellular dynamics remains elusive particularly due to the presence of two potential actin - interacting domains . Genetic engineering is incorporated to construct the mutants of transgelin - 2 , and the difference among the mutants in the spatiotemporal response in FRAP experiments is analyzed . We then extract the pure diffusion coefficient intrinsic to transgelin - 2 as well as its dissociation constant from the actin filaments , in which the latter is determined for each of the actin - interacting domains . The approach described here will be useful in the domain - level characterization of the physicochemical properties of cellular proteins . Materials and methods Cells , plasmids , and antibodies Rat aortic smooth muscle cell lines ( A7r5 , ATCC ) were cultured with low - glucose ( 1 . 0 g / L ) Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium ( Wako ) containing 10 % ( v / v ) heat - inactivated fetal bovine serum ( SAFC Biosciences ) and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin ( Wako ) in a 5 % CO 2 incubator at 37°C . Expression plasmids encoding mClover2 - tagged transgelin - 2 ( TAGLN2 ) and mRuby2 - tagged Lifeact were constructed by inserting the PCR - amplified cDNAs ( human TAGLN2 , pFN21ASDA0120 , Kazusa DNA Research Institute ; Lifeact , Addgene plasmid # 54688 ; a gift from Michael Davidson ) into the mClover2 - C1 vector ( Addgene plasmid # 54577 , a gift from Michael Davidson ) and the mRuby2 - N1 vector ( Addgene plasmid # 54614 , a gift from Michael Davidson ) , respectively . The following domain - deletion mutants of TAGLN2 were constructed by inverse PCR using a KOD Plus Mutagenesis Kit ( Toyobo ) ( Table S1 for the sequences of the primers used ) : Δ CH ( Δ 25 - 136 ) , Δ AB ( Δ 153 - 160 ) , Δ CR ( Δ 174 - 197 ) , Δ CH Δ CR , Δ AB Δ CR , Δ AB Δ CH , and Δ AB Δ CH Δ CR . An expression plasmid encoding mClover2 - beta - actin was constructed by inserting a human beta - actin gene , which was digested with XhoI and BamHI restriction enzymes from the EYFP - actin vector ( # 6902 - 1 , Clontech ) into the mClover2 - C1 vector . These plasmids were transfected to cells 24 h after the seeding using Lipofectamine LTX and plus Reagent ( Thermo Fischer Scientific ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Rabbit polyclonal anti - TAGLN2 ( ab121146 , Abcam ) , mouse monoclonal anti - GFP ( 012 - 22541 , Wako ) , and anti - beta - actin ( G043 , ABM ) were used for detecting endogenous TAGLN2 proteins , mClover2 tagged - mutants of TAGLN2 , and beta - actin proteins , respectively . Western blotting Cells transfected with the plasmids for 24 h were lysed by the SDS sample buffer . Lysates were centrifuged at 14 , 000 rpm for 15 min at 4 (cid:3) , and the supernatants were collected . Protein concentration was quantified by BCA Protein Assay Kit ( Thermo Fischer Scientific ) . The proteins were fractionated by 12 % gradient SDS - PAGE , transferred onto PVDF membranes ( Millipore ) , blocked with 5 % ( w / v ) BSA for 1 h , incubated with the primary antibodies overnight , blocked again with 4 % skim milk for 1 h , and incubated with the HRP - conjugated secondary antibodies ( Bio - Rad ; # 1705047 for β - actin and mClover2 , # 1705046 for TAGLN2 ) for 1 h and with the enhanced chemiluminescence reagent ( Immobilon Western , Millipore ) for 1 h . Bands were detected by Immobilon Western ( Millipore ) . Chemiluminescence images were taken by CCD - based imaging system ( ChemiDoc XRS + , Bio - Rad ) . FRAP experiments Cells were cultured on a glass - bottom dish and transfected with the plasmids for 24 h for FRAP experiments . The fluorescence intensity profiles were obtained by using the FV1000 confocal laser scanning microscope ( Olympus ) with a 60X oil immersion objective lens ( NA = 1 . 42 ) . A square region containing a single SF was bleached for 1 s by using a 405 / 440 - nm wavelength laser . Meanwhile , the line - scanning was conducted along the longitudinal length every 1 . 62 ms for totally ~ 10 s ( to acquire in total 6 , 000 frames ) using a 488 - nm wavelength laser . Setting (cid:8) (cid:2) 0 s to be the time of completion of the photobleaching , ventral stress fibers ( SFs ) were thus scanned during pre - bleach ( (cid:12)2 (cid:14) (cid:8) (cid:15) (cid:12)1 s ) , photobleaching ( (cid:12)1 (cid:14) (cid:8) (cid:15) 0 s ) , and recovery ( (cid:8) (cid:17) 0 s ) . 2D - scanning was then followed to capture the entire bleached regions every 0 . 5 s for ~ 30 s ( to acquire in total 60 frames ) . Images were analyzed using ImageJ software ( NIH ) and MATLAB ( MathWorks ) . The time evolution of the fluorescence intensity spatially averaged over the bleached length (cid:18) (cid:5) ( see also Fig . 4A ) , normalized by the original intensity averaged temporally over the period of pre - bleach and spatially over the same length (cid:18) (cid:5) , is fitted by the least - square method to a single exponential equation (cid:19)(cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:8)(cid:22) (cid:2) (cid:23)(cid:21)1 (cid:12) (cid:24)e (cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8) (cid:22) # (cid:21)1(cid:22) where (cid:10) (cid:21)(cid:2) 1 (cid:27)⁄(cid:22) represents the recovery rate or the inverse of the time constant (cid:27) , and (cid:23) and (cid:24) are fitting parameters ; specifically , (cid:23) represents the mobile fraction . Model description We consider general ABPs ( Fig . 1A ) , for which we later assume a specific protein – transgelin - 2 encoded by the TAGLN2 gene . The reaction - diffusion equation of the system is described by ∂(cid:19) ∂(cid:8) (cid:2) (cid:0) (cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12) (cid:29) (cid:0) (cid:19) (cid:12) (cid:10) (cid:2)(cid:3) (cid:19) (cid:30) (cid:10) (cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:4) (cid:31) # (cid:21)2(cid:22) ∂(cid:31) ∂(cid:8) (cid:2) (cid:0) (cid:13) (cid:29) (cid:0) (cid:31) (cid:30) (cid:10) (cid:2)(cid:3) (cid:19) (cid:12) (cid:10) (cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:4) (cid:31) # (cid:21)3(cid:22) where (cid:19) and (cid:31) represent the concentrations of an ABP at the unbinding ( free ) and binding ( complex ) state , respectively ; (cid:0) (cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12) and (cid:0) (cid:13) represent the pure diffusion coefficients at the unbinding and binding state , respectively ; (cid:10) (cid:2)(cid:3) and (cid:10) (cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:4) represent the association and dissociation rates , respectively ; (cid:29) (cid:0) represents the Laplace operator . We now introduce two assumptions in accordance with previous studies dealing with similar systems ( Sprague et al . 2004a ) . First , the binding site of the actin filaments is considered immobile , and thus the diffusion is ignored upon the binding ( i . e . , (cid:0) (cid:13) ! 0 ) . This assumption is reasonable for the present case as the turnover of the actin filaments in SFs is much slower than that of transgelin - 2 as demonstrated in the results . Second , the reaction is considered to take place under equilibrium , which is reasonable as the total amounts of transgelin - 2 and actin will remain constant over the brief time course of the FRAP experiments , and in addition photobleaching is supposed to affect only the fluorescence intensity but not the reaction rate . Consequently , during the binding state , the system is virtually at a steady state , and hence Eq . ( 3 ) is reduced to (cid:19) (cid:2) (cid:10) (cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:4) (cid:10) (cid:2)(cid:3) (cid:31) (cid:2) " (cid:31) # (cid:21)4(cid:22) where " represents the equilibrium dissociation constant defined as " (cid:2) (cid:10) (cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:4) / (cid:10) (cid:2)(cid:3) . Thus , Eq . ( 2 ) is now reduced to a form of the diffusion equation ∂(cid:19) ∂(cid:8) (cid:2) (cid:0) (cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:4) (cid:29) (cid:0) (cid:19) # (cid:21)5(cid:22) where (cid:0) (cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:4) (cid:2) (cid:0) (cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12) 1 (cid:30) " (cid:6)(cid:14) # (cid:21)6(cid:22) characterizes the slowed diffusion of the ABP due to its binding to the actin filaments in SFs , which has been referred to as “effective” diffusion coefficient ( Crank 1975 ; Sprague et al . 2004a ; Ait - Haddou et al . 2010 ) . The analytical solution of Eq . ( 5 ) is described on a rectangular bleached region by (cid:19)(cid:21) & , ( , (cid:8)(cid:22) (cid:19) (cid:15) (cid:2) 1 (cid:12) " (cid:15) 4 ) erf , & (cid:30) (cid:18) (cid:5) 2 - (cid:5) (cid:0) (cid:30) 4(cid:0) (cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:4) (cid:8) . (cid:12) erf , & (cid:12) (cid:18) (cid:5) 2 - (cid:5) (cid:0) (cid:30) 4(cid:0) (cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:4) (cid:8) . / 0erf1 ( (cid:30) (cid:18) (cid:16) 2 - (cid:5) (cid:0) (cid:30) 4(cid:0) (cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:4) (cid:8)2 (cid:12) erf 1 ( (cid:12) (cid:18) (cid:16) 2 - (cid:5) (cid:0) (cid:30) 4(cid:0) (cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:4) (cid:8)23 # (cid:21)7(cid:22) where (cid:19) (cid:15) , " (cid:15) , (cid:5) , (cid:18) (cid:5) and (cid:18) (cid:16) , and erf represent the intensity in the pre - bleach state , photobleaching parameter , laser resolution , width and height of the bleached rectangular area , and the error function ( i . e . , erf(cid:21)5(cid:22) (cid:2) (cid:0) √(cid:18) 6 7 (cid:6)(cid:19) (cid:0) 8 & (cid:20) (cid:15) ) , respectively ( Deschout et al . 2010 ) . Determination of the reaction - diffusion parameters FRAP experiments that provide the effective diffusion coefficient (cid:0) (cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:4) are per se not sufficient for determining the pure diffusion coefficient (cid:0) (cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12) . To overcome this limitation , deletion mutants of the protein with ( reactive system ) or without ( non - reactive system ) actin - binding domains are constructed by genetic manipulation ( Fig . 1B ) . The effective diffusion coefficient obtained with the FRAP on the non - reactive system is regarded as the pure diffusion coefficient of the system , i . e . , (cid:0) (cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:4) (cid:2) (cid:0) (cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12) . The actual pure diffusion coefficient in the reactive system is estimated from the pure diffusion coefficient in the non - reactive system of Δ AB Δ CH by compensating for the effect of the molecular weight ( 9 ) according to the Stokes - Einstein equation , (cid:0) (cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12) : 1 / √9 (cid:2) for spherical particles with constant density ( Sprague et al . 2004b ) . Together with this pure diffusion coefficient and the effective diffusion coefficient obtained in the reactive system , the equilibrium dissociation constant in the reactive system is now estimated following Eq . ( 6 ) . The spatiotemporal intensity data in the FRAP experiments were then applied to Eq . ( 7 ) to determine the values of the reaction - diffusion parameters by the maximum likelihood method ( Deschout et al . 2010 ) . Numerical analysis : Brownian dynamics simulation of reaction - diffusion systems 2D numerical analyses were performed to describe how the diffusion of particles is contaminated by the chemical interaction with the surroundings characterized by (cid:10) (cid:2)(cid:3) and (cid:10) (cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:4) . Stochastic events of either binding or unbinding are determined at each time step by a number < between 0 and 1 from a random number generator , at which particles with < (cid:17) (cid:10) (cid:2)(cid:3) / (cid:21)(cid:10) (cid:2)(cid:3) (cid:30) (cid:10) (cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:4) (cid:22) are bound to hypothetical immobile sites , whereas those with < (cid:15) (cid:10) (cid:2)(cid:3) / (cid:21)(cid:10) (cid:2)(cid:3) (cid:30) (cid:10) (cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:4) (cid:22) are allowed to move to follow the random Gaussian process with the displacement variance = (cid:0) (cid:2) 2(cid:0) (cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12) Δ(cid:8) where Δ(cid:8) represents the time interval ( Qian et al . 1991 ; Nitsche and Hinch 1995 ) . The resulting MSD and the effective diffusion coefficient at time (cid:8) were computed by (cid:4)(cid:5) (cid:21)(cid:0) (cid:6) (cid:2) (cid:4) | @ (cid:21) (cid:21)(cid:8)(cid:22) (cid:12) @ (cid:21) (cid:21)0(cid:22) | (cid:6) # (cid:21)8(cid:22) (cid:0) (cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:4) (cid:2) (cid:4)(cid:5) (cid:21)(cid:0) (cid:6) 4(cid:8)⁄ # (cid:21)9(cid:22) where @ (cid:21) is the position of the i - th particle ( Qian et al . 1991 ; Smelser et al . 2015 ; Matsunaga et al . 2020 ) . Numerical analysis : continuum simulation of two extreme cases of the FRAP response 1D numerical analyses were performed to highlight the difference in the response in FRAP experiments between pure diffusion - based recovery and turnover - based one . Temporal change in the concentration of fluorophores (cid:19) is described in the pure diffusion - driven case by ∂(cid:19) ∂(cid:8) (cid:2) (cid:0) (cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12) ∂ (cid:0) (cid:19) ∂ & (cid:0) # (cid:21)10(cid:22) or in the turnover - driven case by ∂(cid:19) ∂(cid:8) (cid:2) (cid:12)(cid:10) (cid:2)(cid:3) (cid:19) (cid:30) (cid:10) (cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:4) (cid:31) (cid:12)(cid:22) # (cid:21)11(cid:22) where (cid:31) (cid:12)(cid:22) is the equilibrium concentration of a reaction partner (cid:31) under an assumption that (cid:31) is virtually unchanged in concentration over time . The initial configuration of the fluorophores in the bleached region is determined by substituting (cid:8) (cid:2) 0 to the 1D equivalent of Eq . ( 7 ) as (cid:19)(cid:21) & , (cid:8) (cid:2) 0(cid:22) (cid:19) (cid:15) (cid:2) 1 (cid:12) " (cid:15) 2 ) erf , & (cid:30) (cid:18) (cid:5) 2 √(cid:5) (cid:0) . (cid:12) erf , & (cid:12) (cid:18) (cid:5) 2 √(cid:5) (cid:0) . / # (cid:21)12(cid:22) , and subsequent temporal evolution was analyzed by Eq . ( 10 ) or by Eq . ( 11 ) , with using a forward difference in time and a central difference in space ( Larkin 1964 ) . Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( FCS ) was performed using the FV1000 confocal laser scanning microscope with a 60X oil immersion objective lens ( NA = 1 . 42 ) at the outside or inside of the cells cultured on a glass - bottom dish and transfected with the plasmid of the non - reactive Δ AB Δ CH of TAGLN2 for 24 h . The diffusion coefficient (cid:0) and the average particle number CD were determined by the least - square method from the autocorrelation function E of the fluorescence intensity F(cid:21)(cid:8)(cid:22) as a function of the lag time (cid:27) described as E (cid:21) (cid:27) (cid:22) (cid:2) (cid:4)GF(cid:21)(cid:8)(cid:22)GF(cid:21)(cid:8) (cid:30) (cid:27)(cid:22)(cid:6) (cid:4)F(cid:6) (cid:0) (cid:2) 1 CD H1 (cid:30) 4(cid:0)(cid:27) I (cid:5)(cid:16)(cid:0) J (cid:6)(cid:14) H1 (cid:30) 4(cid:0)(cid:27) I (cid:20)(cid:0) J (cid:6)(cid:14) / (cid:0) # (cid:21) 15 (cid:22) where GF (cid:21) (cid:8) (cid:22) (cid:21)(cid:2) F(cid:21)(cid:8)(cid:22) (cid:12) (cid:4) F (cid:6) (cid:22) represents the fluctuation of the intensity detected every 2 ns , and I (cid:5)(cid:16) and I (cid:24) represent confocal volume parameters ( 0 . 17 μ m and 2 . 8 μ m , respectively ) determined from the current setup of the numerical aperture , wavelength , and pin - hole size ( Krichevsky and Bonnet 2002 ) . Statistical analysis Unless otherwise stated , data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation of more than 5 independent experiments . Differences were calculated based on the unpaired Student’s t - test , with a significance level of K (cid:15) 0 . 01 ( * ) or K (cid:15) 0 . 05 ( * * ) . Results Numerical simulations validate the research design To illustrate the conceptual basis of the present study , we simulated 2D diffusion of particles undergoing stochastic interactions with hypothetical immobile sites . The MSD was analyzed by tracking the position of individual particles to show that the MSD is proportional to the elapsed time as expected ( Fig . 2A ; Table S2 for the parameters used ) . The slope of the MSD – time curve , corresponding to the diffusion coefficient , was confirmed to be smaller with larger binding probabilities . As such , the ratio of the diffusion coefficient at specific binding probability ( i . e . , effective diffusion ) to that at (cid:10) (cid:2)(cid:3) (cid:2) 0 ( i . e . , pure diffusion ) , namely (cid:0) (cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:4) (cid:0) (cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12) ⁄ , was linearly decreased upon the increased binding probability ( Fig . 2B ) . Thus , the substantive diffusion is slowed in the presence of the chemical interaction , which we aim with the experiments below to decompose into the two independent factors , i . e . , the inherent pure diffusion and chemical interaction . We also numerically simulated the response in FRAP experiments to validate our approach to determining the above two factors . Specifically , our approach is essentially based firstly on the use of Eq . ( 7 ) and secondly on that of the genetic engineering ( Fig . 1B ) . Regarding this first basis , we use below both the spatial and temporal information in Eq . ( 7 ) to interpret the FRAP data , while the single exponential approach of Eq . ( 1 ) – or more generally an approach omitting the spatial information – should be inadequate in the present aim . To numerically demonstrate this , the recovery process along a bleached length (cid:18) (cid:5) driven by the pure diffusion according to Eq . ( 10 ) was compared to that driven completely by the chemical reaction according to Eq . ( 11 ) ( Fig . 2C ; Table S3 for the parameters used ) . The intensity profile dominated by the chemical reaction is spatially uniformly recovered while maintaining the initial form , whereas that dominated by the diffusion displays a normal distribution . The time - course change at the bleached region consequently exhibits an identical curve regardless of the bleached length (cid:18) (cid:5) in the chemical reaction - dominant case , whereas that in the diffusion - dominant case does depend on (cid:18) (cid:5) ( Fig . 2D ) . Thus , except such a fully chemical reaction - dominant case , the recovery rate (cid:10) ( Kapitza et al . 1985 ; Chloë Bulinski et al . 2001 ; Sprague et al . 2004a ) determined using Eq . ( 1 ) or the extent of pure diffusion is underestimated particularly with a large - sized (cid:18) (cid:5) ( Fig . 2E ) . This limitation on the dependence on the bleach size is circumvented by analyzing the spatial distribution in Eq . ( 7 ) . Regarding the above - described second basis of the necessity of the genetic engineering , the diffusion coefficient determined with Eq . ( 7 ) is only an “effective” one , to which the chemical reaction inevitably simultaneously contributes . To isolate the respective contributions , the reactive domain ( s ) in the protein is identified and deleted by genetic manipulation , and the resulting deletion mutant is tested for determining the now “pure” diffusion properties as the protein mutant is biologically inert and thus behaves only in a diffusive way ( Fig . 1B ) . Finally , " that characterizes the chemical interaction in Eq . ( 4 ) is extracted from Eq . ( 6 ) , in which the pure diffusion coefficient is modified by compensation of the decreased mass due to the domain deletion . Transgelin - 2 interacts with F - actin in living cells via two actin - binding domains Trangelin - 2 – containing an N - terminal calponin homology domain ( CH domain ) between 25 to 136 amino acid residues , an actin - binding motif ( AB domain ) between 153 to 160 amino acid residues , and a C - terminal calponin - repeat domain ( CR domain ) between 174 to 197 amino acid residues – has been reported to be associated with F - actin via the CH and AB domains ( Castresana and Saraste 1995 ; Solway and Fredberg 1997 ; Na et al . 2015 ) . To modulate the association with F - actin , we constructed comprehensive combinations of deletion mutants of transgelin - 2 tagged with mClover2 at the N - terminus , in which the CH , AB , and / or CR domains were deleted ( Fig . 3A ) . We expected that the mutants with at least one of the CH and AB domains , in addition to the full - length wild type ( FL ) , are able to be associated with F - actin ( referred to as the reactive system ) , while those without both of the two domains are unable ( the non - reactive system ) . To confirm the colocalization with F - actin , A7r5 cells transfected with one of the mClover2 - labeled mutants and Lifeact - mRuby2 that visualizes F - actin were imaged and analyzed ( Fig . 3B , 3C ) . FL and Δ CR clearly displayed a SF - like fibrous pattern similar to that of Lifeact - mRuby2 , with a high level of Pearson correlation coefficient R between the two fluorescent labels of 0 . 75 and 0 . 51 , respectively . With the deletion of either the CH or AB domain ( i . e . , Δ AB , Δ AB Δ CR , Δ CH , and Δ CH Δ CR ) , the transgelin - 2 mutants displayed a relatively diffusive but slightly fibrous pattern , with a moderate R level of 0 . 25 – 0 . 33 . With the deletion of both Δ CH and Δ AB ( i . e . , Δ AB Δ CH and Δ AB Δ CH Δ CR ) , the transgelin - 2 mutants displayed a completely diffusive pattern with a low R level below 0 . 11 , while Lifeact - mRuby2 or F - actin in SFs still exhibited the fibrous pattern . Thus , at least the AB or CH domain is indeed required for the association of transgelin - 2 to F - actin , while the CR domain is dispensable . F - actin in SFs works as an immobile scaffold for transgelin - 2 In the FRAP experiments using the transgelin - 2 mutants , line - scanning was conducted along the center of the bleached region to detect the fluorescence recovery at a high temporal resolution ( Fig . 4A ) . FL , as a control , exhibited a slow recovery and a large immobile fraction compared to the other mutants ( Fig . 4B , 4C ; Video S1 ) , suggesting that the association to F - actin impedes the substantive diffusion of transgelin - 2 . The time evolution of the fluorescence was analyzed based on the single exponential function of Eq . ( 1 ) , and the recovery rate (cid:10) ( Fig . 4D ) and mobile fraction (cid:23) ( Fig . S1 ) were quantified . We found that (cid:10) was significantly increased with any deletion mutant up to ~ 1 . 5 – 2 . 0 s - 1 on average compared to the control FL with an average (cid:10) of ~ 0 . 75 s - 1 ( Fig . 4D , Video S2 – S8 ) . Δ CR thus resulted in an increase in (cid:10) compared to FL , although this mutant possesses both of the CH and AB domains used for the association to F - actin . This increase might be caused because the removal of the CR domain distorts the rest of the protein conformation including the critical CH / AB domains to reduce its affinity to F - actin , and / or decreases the molecular weight to increase the pure diffusion coefficient . Similar tendency was obtained for the mobile fraction ( Fig . S1 ) . Notably , no significant difference was observed among the deletion mutants ( Fig . 4D , S1 ) , but as described in the next section the current approach based on Eq . ( 1 ) may be inadequate to accurately capture the potential functional differences among them . Nevertheless , in a separate FRAP experiment , the turnover of F - actin tagged with mClover2 was found to exhibit a recovery rate (cid:10) of 0 . 0095 ± 0 . 0077 s - 1 , i . e . , two orders of magnitude lower than that of transgelin - 2 ( Fig . 5A , 5B ; Video S9 ) . These results suggest that F - actin in SFs may be regarded as an immobile scaffold , and the assumption introduced to set (cid:0) (cid:13) ! 0 in Eq . ( 3 ) is justified . Distinction between the effective and pure diffusions enables the extraction of the reaction properties To determine the effective diffusion coefficient (cid:0) (cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:4) based on Eq . ( 7 ) , spatiotemporal recovery data (cid:19)(cid:21) & , ( , (cid:8)(cid:22) up to the time that corresponds to the time constant (cid:27) was analyzed ( Fig . 6A , Video S10 ) . Compared to FL , (cid:0) (cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:4) was significantly increased for all the deletion mutants ( Fig . 6B ) . The mutants without the CH domain – i . e . , Δ CH , Δ CH Δ CR , Δ AB Δ CH , and Δ AB Δ CH Δ CR – all exhibited a markedly significant increase in (cid:0) (cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:4) , likely because the greater reduction in their molecular weight compared to the deletion of the AB and CR domains might significantly elevate their diffusion rate , and / or the CH domain might critically contribute to the binding to actin compared to the AB domain . Δ CR resulted solely in a significant increase in (cid:0) (cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:4) , which will be discussed below . In the analysis , photobleaching parameter and laser resolution were found to be ~ 1 and ~ 0 . 2 μ m , respectively . While (cid:0) (cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:4) of transgelin - 2 was thus determined , the effective diffusion does not rigorously distinguish per se between pure diffusion and chemical interaction with other proteins . We then estimated the pure diffusion coefficient of transgelin - 2 – which characterizes its inherent diffusive properties independent of the chemical interaction – from the specific (cid:0) (cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:4) determined in the non - reactive system , i . e . , the mutants with no actin - interacting domain Δ AB Δ CH ( Fig . 1B ) . To do this , we compensated for the reduction in the molecular weight due to the deletion of the domain ( s ) in the Stokes - Einstein equation to modify the pure diffusion coefficient in accordance with the reactive system . The molecular weight of each mutant with the fluorescent tag is known from the amino acid sequence ( Fig . 3A ) , and indeed those values were consistent with the ones observed in the Western blots ( Fig . 6C ) . In the non - reactive system , the effective diffusion coefficient is equivalent to the pure diffusion coefficient (cid:0) (cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:3)(cid:2)(cid:3) , which was then converted to the pure diffusion coefficient in the reactive system (cid:0) (cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:25)(cid:13)(cid:26)(cid:21)(cid:27)(cid:12) according to (cid:0) (cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:25)(cid:13)(cid:26)(cid:21)(cid:27)(cid:12) (cid:2) (cid:0) (cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:3)(cid:2)(cid:3) H9 (cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:25)(cid:13)(cid:26)(cid:21)(cid:27)(cid:12) 9 (cid:3)(cid:2)(cid:3) J (cid:6)(cid:14)(cid:28) # (cid:21)16(cid:22) where 9 (cid:3)(cid:2)(cid:3) and 9 (cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:25)(cid:13)(cid:26)(cid:21)(cid:27)(cid:12) represent the molecular weight in the non - reactive and reactive systems , respectively . (cid:0) (cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12) (cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:25)(cid:13)(cid:26)(cid:21)(cid:27)(cid:12) was thus obtained for each of the mutants as all the factors of the right side of Eq . ( 16 ) were now known ( Fig . 6B ) . The acquired pure diffusion coefficients are relatively comparable in magnitude among the mutants because of the limited effect of the mass provided by one - third power of the ratio . Significant differences were found between the effective and pure diffusion coefficients in FL , Δ AB , and Δ CR , reflecting the contamination of the Brownian diffusion by the chemical interaction . As partial validation , FCS was performed to assess the diffusion coefficient obtained by the above FRAP analysis although the measurable range of diffusion coefficients is typically ~ 0 . 01 – 10 μ m 2 / s for FRAP and ~ 1 – 10 3 for FCS ( Matsuda and Nagai 2014 ; Lorén et al . 2015 ) . The non - reactive mutant Δ AB Δ CH within SFs was estimated in the FRAP analysis to have a (cid:0) (cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12) ( = (cid:0) (cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:4) ) of ~ 0 . 04 μ m 2 / s ( Fig . 6B ) , which is considerably below the effective range of FCS . Therefore , we instead focused on the same non - reactive mutant in the cytoplasm with looser actin meshwork , in which the molecules are supposed to diffuse faster compared to the inside of SFs composed of tighter actin bundles ( Okamoto et al . 2020 ) , and hence a larger (cid:0) (cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12) closer to the range of FCS might be obtained . Our FRAP analysis thus determined (cid:0) (cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12) of Δ AB Δ CH in the cytoplasm other than SFs to be 0 . 25 ± 0 . 14 μ m 2 / s ( Fig . S2 ) . Meanwhile , FCS provided an estimate of 0 . 64 ± 0 . 16 μ m 2 / s in the same conditions . (cid:0) (cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12) of the representative molecule Δ AB Δ CH was thus shown to be approximately in the same order of magnitude regardless of the methods used , hence partially verifying the quantitative consistency with the other methodology and the plausibility of the other values determined based on our proposed FRAP framework . Next , from the resulting sets of (cid:0) (cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:4) and (cid:0) (cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12) ( Fig . 6B ) , the equilibrium dissociation constant " (cid:2) (cid:10) (cid:2)(cid:4)(cid:4) / (cid:10) (cid:2)(cid:3) was obtained for both the reactive and non - reactive systems from Eq . ( 6 ) with the assumption that the chemical interaction takes place at equilibrium ( Fig . 6D ) . A " value of the unity indicates a state that the association rate is equal to the dissociation rate , and thus the amount of the proteins is the same between the binding and unbinding states . FL with a " of < 1 is thus suggested to be preferentially at the binding state . Δ CH and Δ CH Δ CR with a " of ~ 10 – 100 are considered to be predominantly at the unbinding state . Δ AB is only slightly higher in " compared to FL , suggesting that , while the AB domain is involved in the interaction with F - actin in SFs ( Fig . 3B , C ) , the association via the AB domain is relatively unstable compared to that via the CH domain . Δ CR is also high in " compared to FL while this mutant still contains the actin - interacting domains of the AB and CH domains . It is likely that , while the CR domain of transgelin - 2 is not directly involved in the association with F - actin , its deletion distorts the rest of the protein conformation to in turn reduce its affinity to F - actin , as previously indicated on the isoform transgelin - 1 ( Matsui et al . , 2018 ) . Δ AB Δ CR is consequently close to Δ CR in the average value of " . Discussion To evaluate the turnover rate of proteins in FRAP experiments , it is often the case that only temporal change in the fluorescence intensity is analyzed , for example , using exponential functions like Eq . ( 1 ) . On the other hand , to dissect the respective contributions of the two major factors – pure diffusion and chemical interaction with other molecules – to the overall “effective” diffusion , the spatial as well as temporal changes may be analyzed as we did here with Eq . ( 7 ) . Importantly , one major challenge in the field of cell signaling research is to identify the role of specific domains of a protein in interacting with other molecules . To this end , the conventional approach in the FRAP analysis can be insufficient particularly in a case that the target protein has multiple domains to independently interact with the same types but different molecules . In this regard , transgelin - 2 has been implicated in interactions with F - actin in cells putatively via two distinct domains ( Castresana and Saraste 1995 ; Solway and Fredberg 1997 ; Na et al . 2015 ; Kim et al . 2018 ) , making the intramolecular origin of the FRAP response uncertain , and was thus selected in the present study to test the validity of our new approach as well as to reveal the manner of the interactions . We then developed a framework that incorporates comprehensive types of deletion mutants of transgelin - 2 into spatiotemporal analyses of FRAP data . This approach requires some effort to construct the mutants , but instead clarifies the chemical equilibrium constants of intermolecular interactions at the individual domain level within the complex milieu of the cell . Pure diffusion properties , which are independent of the association / dissociation to the surrounding molecules and are thus intrinsic to the molecules , are also obtained in our analysis from the diffusive behavior of the non - reactive mutant . The described framework is universally applicable , in addition to transgelin - 2 demonstrated here , to any protein bound to virtually immobile scaffolds like ventral SFs ( Saito et al . 2020 ; Okamoto et al . 2020 ) , thus providing a versatile approach to identifying the role of protein domains expressed within living cells . Transgelin - 2 has been implicated in various processes including tumorigenesis , cell migration / invasion , proliferation , differentiation , and embryo implantation ( Yoshino et al . 2011 ; Yakabe et al . 2016 ; Jeon et al . 2018 ; Liang et al . 2019 ; Liu et al . 2019 ) , but its mechanistic basis remains elusive . Transgelin - 2 is known for its ability to polymerize G - actin and crosslink F - actin , which may eventually contribute – as many other ABPs that account for ~ 25 % of the total cellular protein do ( Pollard 2016 ; Lappalainen 2016 ; Jo et al . 2018 ; Kim et al . 2018 ) – to maintaining the actin monomer pool available for the polymerization and promoting the elongation in a cell context - dependent manner . To quantitatively analyze these complicated cell processes in which a number of proteins are potentially involved , the knowledge obtained with simplified in vitro experiments where only a limited number of molecules are considered is not necessarily valid . In fact , the manner of the association of transgelin - 2 to F - actin is distinct between in vitro and in cells . Specifically , among the known five types of CH domains , transgelin - 2 has type - 3 CH domain ( Gimona et al . 2002 ) that is actually unable to bind F - actin in vitro ( Gimona and Mital 1998 ; Fu et al . 2000 ; Goodman et al . 2003 ) . Accordingly , the firmer association of the CH domain to F - actin over the AB domain within cells suggests that cellular transgelin - 2 forms a complex with F - actin predominantly via a third protein bound to the CH domain . Given the presence of other actin - associated proteins containing type - 3 CH - domain , such as calponin , vav , and IQGAP ( Gimona et al . 2002 ; Yin et al . 2020 ) , it is presumably difficult to accurately evaluate the intracellular physicochemical properties of at least these proteins by only conventional FRAP experiments . The in situ domain - level determination of the reaction properties independent of the pure diffusion nature will thus be useful , as presented here for transgelin - 2 , in revealing the real signaling mechanism of cellular proteins .

( D ) Time course of the fluorescence recovery with the completely reaction - driven ( left ) or diffusion - driven ( right ) model . ( E ) Recovery rate (cid:10) as a function of the normalized bleached length (cid:18) (cid:5) / M obtained by fitting Eq . ( 1 ) to the data in D with the least - square method . Fig . 3 Transgelin - 2 binds F - actin via the CH and AB domains . ( A ) Schematic diagram of the domain structure of transgelin - 2 ( encoded by the 7 . 4 (cid:3) kb TAGLN2 gene ) and its mutants . mClover2 present at the N - terminus is omitted . ( B ) Confocal images of representative cells to analyze the intracellular colocalization between transgelin - 2 or its mutant ( mClover2 ) and F - actin ( Lifeact ) . Scale , 20 μ m . ( C ) The relationship of the fluorescence intensity between Lifeact ( ordinate ) and mClover2 ( abscissa ) measured at each pixel of the confocal images , with Pearson correlation coefficient R between the two fluorescent labels . Fig . 4 FRAP analysis suggests that the deletion of the domains of transgelin - 2 destabilizes its association to F - actin . ( A ) A part of individual SFs is bleached in 2D , and the resulting fluorescence recovery is probed by the line - scanning along the middle of the bleached region at a high temporal resolution . ( B ) Confocal images of transgelin - 2 and its mutants taken before ( (cid:8) = - 2 s ) , just after ( (cid:8) = 0 s ) , and after ( (cid:8) = - 7 s ) the bleaching , with respective kymographs on the right . Scale , 1 μ m . ( C ) Time course of (cid:19)(cid:20) for different mutants is shown by two ways : a linear scale plot ( upper ) and a log - log plot ( lower ) . ( D ) (cid:10) for different mutants . Asterisks represent statistically significant differences compared to FL ( * , K (cid:15) 0 . 01 ) . Fig . 5 FRAP analysis suggests that F - actin in SFs works as an immobile scaffold for transgelin - 2 . ( A ) Confocal images of mClover2 - beta - actin subjected to FRAP . Scale , 5 μ m . ( B ) Time course of (cid:19)(cid:20) in the FRAP response of mClover2 - beta - actin is shown by two ways – a linear scale plot ( left , mean ± SD ) and a log - log plot ( right , mean ) – showing that the recovery is obviously slower compared to that of transgelin - 2 in Fig . 4 .

Background data are shown as a negative control ( green ) . ( B ) Quantitative comparison of the (cid:0) (cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12) of the non - reactive Δ AB Δ CH determined by the two distinct ways , FCS and FRAP . Boxes represent the 25th and 75th percentiles and the median . Open squares indicate the means . Whiskers extend from the box ends to the most remote points excluding the outliers defined as 1 . 5X the interquartile range . There is a significant difference between the two populations ( K (cid:15) 0 . 01 ) , but they may be regarded comparable in order of magnitude , both with a (cid:0) (cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12) value on the order of 0 . 1 – 1 . 0 μ m 2 / s .
