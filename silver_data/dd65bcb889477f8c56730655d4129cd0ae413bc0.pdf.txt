INTRODUCTION Particle polarizability governs the electric response for many inhomogeneous systems ranging from biological cells to plasmonic nanoparticles and depends strongly on both its dielectric and geometric properties . Analytical models have been reported [ 1 , 2 ] only for spherical and ellipsoidal geometries , whereas more complex geometries have been approached by direct numerical solution of the ﬁeld equations using , for example , the ﬁnite diﬀerence methods [ 3 ] , the ﬁnite element method [ 4 ] , the boundary element method [ 5 , 6 ] , or the boundary integral equation ( BIE ) [ 7 ] . In a simpliﬁed representation , biological cells can be regarded as homogeneous particles ( cores ) covered by thin membranes ( shells ) of contrasting electric conductivities and permit - tivities . Complex geometries occur when cells are undergoing division cycles ( e . g . budding yeasts ) or are coupled in functional tissues ( e . g . lining epithelia or myocardial syncytia ) . In these cases , the dielectric / impedance analysis of cellular systems is far more complicated than previous models [ 8 – 10 ] , which considered suspensions of spherical particles . Intriguing dielectric spectra [ 11 ] reveal distinct dielectric dispersions with time evolutions consistently related to tissue functioning or alteration , identifying a possible role of cell connectors ( gap junctions ) in shaping the overall dielectric response . A direct relation between the microscopic parameters and experimental data can be analytically derived only for dilute suspensions of particles of simple shapes , and is rather challenging for system with more realistic shapes , where only purely numerical solutions have been available . In this work we demonstrate that a spectral representation of a BIE provides the analytical structure for the polarizability of particles with a wide range of shapes and structures . The numerically calculated parameters encode particle’s geometry information and are accessible by experiments . By using single and double - layer potentials [ 12 ] , the Laplace equation for the ﬁelds inside and outside the particle is transformed into an integral equation . A spectral representation for the solution of this equation is obtained providing the eigenvalue problem for the linear response operator is solved . Although not symmetric , this operator has a real spectrum bounded by - 1 / 2 and 1 / 2 [ 13 – 15 ] and its eigenvectors are orthogonal to those of the conjugate double - layer operator . A matrix representation is obtained by using a ﬁnite basis of surface functions . 2 The true advantage of the spectral method is that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the integral operator provide valuable insight into the dielectric behavior of clusters of biological cells . The eigenvectors are a measure of surface charge distributions due to a ﬁeld . Only eigenvectors with a non - zero dipole moment contribute to the polarizability of the particle . We call these dipole - active eigenmodes . An eﬀective separation of the geometric and mor - phologic properties from dielectric properties is therefore achieved [ 16 ] . We also show that for a particle covered by multiple confocal shells , the relaxation spectrum is a sum of Debye terms with the number of relaxations equal to the number of interfaces times the number of dipole - active eigenvalues . This is a generalization of a previous result [ 17 ] on cells of arbitrary shape . Our method is related to another spectral approach which uses an eigenvalue diﬀerential equation [ 18 – 21 ] . This method has been applied to biological problems by Lei et al . [ 22 ] and by Huang et al . [ 23 ] . These authors , however , considered homogeneous cells with much simpler expression for cell polarizability . The BIE spectral method seeks a solution on the boundary surface deﬁning the particle , as opposed to the eigenvalue diﬀerential equation , where the solution is deﬁned in the entire space . In a previous study on double ( budding ) cells it was shown that before cells separation an additional dispersion occurs [ 24 ] . Moreover , in recent papers [ 3 , 25 ] numerical experiments have shown that the dielectric spectra of a suspension of dimer cells connected by tight junctions exhibit an additional , distinct low - frequency relaxation . Our numerical calculation shows that the largest dipole - active eigenvalue approaches the value of 1 / 2 as the junction become tighter . Although the coupling of this eigenmode with the electric ﬁeld stimulus is relatively modest ( the coupling weight is about 1 - 2 % ) , this eigenmode has a signiﬁcant contribution to the polarizability of clusters . Thus the eigenmodes close to 1 / 2 induce an additional low - frequency relaxation in the dielectric spectra of clustered biological cells even though the coupling is quite small . Needle - like objects , such as elongated spheroids or long cylinders , have similar polarizability features . In this paper we consider rotationally symmetric linear clusters made of up to 4 identi - cal particles covered by thin insulating membranes and connected by junctions of variable tightness . Convenient and ﬂexible representations for the surfaces describing these objects are provided . The number of relaxations in the dielectric spectrum of the linear clusters , their time constants and their relative strengths are analyzed in terms of the eigenmodes of 3 the linear response operator speciﬁc to the given shape . II . THEORY A . Eﬀective permittivity of a suspension We consider a suspension of identical , randomly oriented particles of arbitrary shape and dielectric permittivity , ε 1 , immersed in a dielectric medium of dielectric permittivity , ε 0 . The dielectric permittivities are in general complex quantities and the theory described here applies also for time - dependent ﬁelds , providing that the size of a particle is much smaller than the wavelength . When an applied uniform electric ﬁeld interacts with the suspension , the response of the system is linear with the applied ﬁeld and an eﬀective permittivity for the whole sample can be measured and is deﬁned by [ 25 – 27 ] : ε sus = ε 0 + f αε 0 1 − f α 3 . ( 1 ) This result is obtained in the limit of low concentration , weak intensity of the stimulus ﬁeld , and using an eﬀective medium theory within the dipole approximation . Here f = NV 1 / V is the volume fraction of all N particles , each of volume V 1 , with respect to the total volume of the suspension V . The averaged normalized polarizability α of a particle is deﬁned as [ 25 , 27 , 28 ] α = 1 4 πV 1 Z V 1 Z Ω N (cid:18) ε 1 − ε 0 ε 0 (cid:19) E ( N ) · N d Ω N dV ( 2 ) where E ( N ) is the electric ﬁeld perturbation created inside the particle under a normalized applied electric excitation with direction N and d Ω N is the solid angle element generated by that direction . The above normalized polarizability is dimensionless and is obtained by multiplying the standard polarizability of a particle with the factor 4 π / V 1 . In the following we will refer only to normalized polarizability , thus , without any confusion , the normalized polarizability α will be simply called polarizability . The directional average in ( 2 ) is equiv - alent to the averaged sum over three orthogonal axes due to the fact that the problem is linear with respect to the applied ﬁeld . The latter is more convenient from computational point of view . The electric ﬁeld inside a particle is obtained by solving the following Laplace equation 4 for the electric potential Φ : ∆Φ ( x ) = 0 , x ∈ ℜ 3 \ Σ Φ | + = Φ | − , x ∈ Σ ε 0 ∂ Φ ∂ n (cid:12)(cid:12) + = ε 1 ∂ Φ ∂ n (cid:12)(cid:12) − , x ∈ Σ Φ → − x · N , | x | → ∞ ( 3 ) where ℜ 3 is the euclidian 3 - dimensional space and Σ is the surface of the particle . The derivatives are taken with respect to the normal vector n to the surface Σ . Due to the mismatch between the polarization inside and outside the object , electric charges accumulate at the interface Σ and create an electric potential which counteracts the uniform electric ﬁeld stimulus . The solution of the above Laplace problem ( 3 ) is therefore formally given by Φ ( x ) = − x · N + 1 4 π Z Σ µ ( y ) | x − y | d Σ ( y ) ( 4 ) The single layer charge distribution µ induced by the normalized electric ﬁeld is a solution of the following BIE , obtained by inserting solution ( 4 ) in equations ( 3 ) µ ( x ) 2 λ − 1 4 π Z Σ µ ( y ) n ( x ) · ( x − y ) | x − y | 3 d Σ ( y ) = n ( x ) · N ( 5 ) Here the parameter λ = ( ε 1 − ε 0 ) / ( ε 1 + ε 0 ) isolates all the information regarding the dielectric properties for this problem . On using the linear response operator M that acts on the Hilbert space of integrable functions on the surface Σ , M [ µ ] = 1 4 π Z Σ µ ( y ) n ( x ) · ( x − y ) | x − y | 3 d Σ ( y ) , ( 6 ) the integral equation ( 5 ) is written as ( 1 / ( 2 λ ) − M ) µ = n · N . ( 7 ) The integral operator ( 6 ) is the electric ﬁeld generated by the single layer charge distribution µ along the normal to the surface . It encodes the geometric information and has several interesting properties [ 13 – 15 ] . Its spectrum is discrete and it is not diﬃcult to show that all of its eigenvalues are bounded by the [ - 1 / 2 , 1 / 2 ] interval . Although non - symmetric , the operator ( 6 ) has real non - degenerate eigenvalues . The eigenvectors are biorthogonal , i . e . , 5 they are not orthogonal among themselves , but orthogonal to the eigenvectors of the adjoint operator M † [ µ ] = 1 4 π Z Σ µ ( y ) n ( y ) · ( x − y ) | x − y | 3 d Σ ( y ) , ( 8 ) which is associated with the electric ﬁeld generated by a surface distribution of electric dipoles ( double layer charge distribution ) . Therefore , if | u k i is a right eigenvector of M corresponding to eigenvalue χ k , M | u k i = χ k | u k i and h v k ′ | is a left eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue χ k ′ , h v k ′ | M † = χ k ′ h v k ′ | , then h v k ′ | u k i = δ k ′ k , ( 9 ) with the scalar product deﬁned as the integral over the interface Σ , h f 1 | f 2 i = Z Σ f ∗ 1 ( x ) f 2 ( x ) d Σ ( x ) . ( 10 ) The value 1 / 2 is always the largest eigenvalue of the operator M , regardless the geometry of the object . This is immediately seen if the object is considered to be conductor ( ε 1 → ∞ ) , and then the interior electric ﬁeld has to be zero . In that case λ = 1 , and the charge density that generates a vanishing internal electric ﬁeld obeys the equation ( 1 / 2 − M ) µ = 0 , and therefore 1 / 2 is an eigenvalue of M . However , this eigenmode is not dipole - active and does not contribute to the total polarization of the object . The operator ( 6 ) is insensitive to a scale transformation , which means that its eigenvalue and eigenvectors depend only on the shape of the object and not on its size , or electrical properties . By employing the spectral representation of the resolvent of the operator M ( z − M ) − 1 = X k ( z − χ k ) − 1 | u k ih v k | , ( 11 ) the solution of equation ( 7 ) is obtained for z = 1 / ( 2 λ ) as µ = X k h v k | n · N i ( 1 / ( 2 λ ) − χ k ) − 1 | u k i . ( 12 ) The polarizability of the homogeneous particle is obtained by using the distribution ( 12 ) to build the solution ( 4 ) of the Laplace equation and use it in equation ( 2 ) . It has been shown that , operationally , the polarizability is simply the dipole moment of the distribution ( 12 ) over unit volume [ 25 , 27 ] 6 α = 1 3 1 V 1 X i , k h x · N i | u k i h v k | n · N i i 1 / ( 2 λ ) − χ k , ( 13 ) where N i are three mutually orthogonal vectors ( directions ) of unit norm . The factor ( 1 / ( 2 λ ) − χ k ) − 1 is a generalized Clausius - Mosotti factor . Each dipole - active eigenmode contributes to α according to its weight p k = 13 1 V 1 P i h x · N i | u k i h v k | n · N i i , which deter - mines the strength of coupling between the uniform electric ﬁeld and the k - th eigenmode and contains three components P k , i = h x · N i | u k i h v k | n · N i i / V 1 . Equation ( 13 ) shows a clear separation of the electric properties , which are included only in λ , from the geometric properties expressed by χ k and p k . B . Shelled particles The polarizability of an object covered by a thin shell with permittivity ε S can be calcu - lated in a similar fashion . The electric ﬁeld is now generated by two single layer distributions , and boundary conditions are imposed twice , for Σ 1 and for Σ 2 . The surface Σ 1 is the outer surface of the shell and Σ 2 is the interface between the particle and the shell . The solution of a shelled particle in terms of single layer potentials has the form [ 28 ] Φ ( x ) = − x · N + 1 4 π Z Σ 1 µ 1 ( y ) | x − y | d Σ ( y ) + 1 4 π Z Σ 2 µ 2 ( y ) | x − y | d Σ ( y ) , ( 14 ) where µ 1 and µ 2 are the densities deﬁned on surface Σ 1 and Σ 2 , respectively . Four integral operators M 11 , M 12 , M 21 and M 22 are deﬁned , depending on which surface are variables x and y . For example M 11 is deﬁned when x and y are both on Σ 1 , M 12 is deﬁned by x on Σ 1 and y on Σ 2 , and so on . Thus M ij [ µ j ] = 1 4 π Z Σ j µ j ( y ) n ( x ) · ( x − y ) | x − y | 3 d Σ ( y ) ( 15 ) for i , j = 1 , 2 . The equations obeyed by µ 1 and µ 2 are µ 1 / ( 2 λ 1 ) − M 11 [ µ 1 ] − M 12 [ µ 2 ] = n · N µ 2 / ( 2 λ 2 ) − M 21 [ µ 1 ] − M 22 [ µ 2 ] = n · N . ( 16 ) Here the electric parameters are : λ 1 = ( ε S − ε 0 ) / ( ε S + ε 0 ) , and λ 2 = ( ε 1 − ε S ) / ( ε 1 + ε S ) . We further assume a confocal geometry , i . e . the surface Σ 1 is a slightly scaled version of Σ 2 , with a scaling factor η close to unity . This assumption does not provide constant thickness for the shell , but our main results should remain at least qualitatively valid [ 3 , 6 ] . 7 In the limit of very thin shells , and using the scaling properties of the operator M , one can show [ 25 , 27 ] that all four M operators are related to M = M 11 M 12 [ µ ] = η − 3 ( µ / 2 + M [ µ ] ) M 12 [ µ ] = − µ / 2 + M [ µ ] M 22 [ µ ] = M [ µ ] . ( 17 ) Equations ( 16 ) can then be arranged in a matrix form as   1 / ( 2 λ 1 − M ) ( 1 / 2 + M ) / η 3 − 1 / 2 + M 1 / ( 2 λ 2 ) − M     µ 1 µ 2   =   n · N n · N   . ( 18 ) By knowing the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of M the charge densities µ 1 and µ 2 can be found by inverting the matrix in ( 18 ) . For example , µ 1 is µ 1 = X k η 3 ( 12 λ 2 − χ k ) + (cid:0) 12 + χ k (cid:1) η 3 (cid:16) 12 λ 1 − χ k (cid:17) (cid:16) 12 λ 2 − χ k (cid:17) + (cid:0) 12 + χ k (cid:1) (cid:0) 12 − χ k (cid:1) h v k | n · N i | u k i . ( 19 ) The ﬁeld generated by the the two distributions µ 1 and µ 2 outside the particle is the same as the ﬁeld generated by an equivalent single layer distribution µ e = X k h v k | n · N i ( 1 / ( 2˜ λ k ) − χ k ) − 1 | u k i , ( 20 ) where ˜ λ k = ( ˜ ε k − ε 0 ) / ( ˜ ε k + ε 0 ) and the equivalent permittivity ˜ ε k is deﬁned for each eigenmode as : ˜ ε k = ε S (cid:18) 1 + ε 1 − ε S ε S + δ ( 1 / 2 − χ k ) ε 1 + δ ( 1 / 2 + χ k ) ǫ S (cid:19) , ( 21 ) where δ = η 3 − 1 ≪ 1 . The distribution ( 20 ) is similar with the distribution ( 12 ) obtained for a homogeneous particle , except that λ has to be replaced for each mode with an equivalent quantity ˜ λ k . Equation ( 21 ) can be applied recursively for a multi - shelled structure . The strict separation of electric and geometric properties is weakened in this case , because the shape - dependent eigenvalue χ k appears now in the electric equivalent quantity ˜ λ k . The polarizability of the shelled particle is obtained by using the distribution ( 20 ) to build the solution ( 4 ) of the Laplace equation and use it in equation ( 2 ) , to get α = 1 3 1 V 1 X i , k h x · N i | u k i h v k | n · N i i 1 / ( 2˜ λ k ) − χ k . ( 22 ) 8 Equation ( 22 ) is obtained by replacing λ with ˜ λ k in Eq . ( 13 ) . The parameter V 1 in Eq . ( 22 ) is the total volume of the cell ( the core and the shells ) . In the limit of a dilute suspension of identical shelled particles , with a low volume fraction f , the eﬀective permittivity ( 1 ) is ε sus = ε 0 1 + f X k p k ˜ ε k − ε 0 ( 1 / 2 + χ k ) ε 0 + ( 1 / 2 − χ k ) ˜ ε k ! . ( 23 ) C . The Debye relaxation expansion In general , the eﬀective permittivity ǫ sus of a suspension of objects with m shells will have m + 1 Debye relaxation terms for each dipole active eigenmode . The proof is recursive and is based on partial fraction expansion with respect to variable iω of equations ( 22 ) and ( 23 ) , provided that the complex permittivity of various dielectric phases is ǫ = ε − i σ / ( ωε vac ) where i = √− 1 and ε vac is the permittivity of the free space ( 8 . 85 × 10 − 12 F / m ) . Thus the ﬁrst Debye term comes out from ( 23 ) and the remaining m Debye terms result from ( 21 ) by the homogenization process described for shelled particles . Hence , a suspension of cells with m shells ( and m + 1 interfaces ) has a dielectric spectrum containing a number of Debye terms equal to m + 1 times the number of dipole - active eigenvalues . The suspension eﬀective permittivity ǫ sus has the expansion ǫ sus = ǫ f + X k , j ∆ ε kj / ( 1 + i ω T kj ) ( 24 ) where ǫ f = ε hf − i σ lf / ( ωε vac ) , ε hf is the high - frequency permittivity , and σ lf is the low - frequency conductivity ; ∆ ε kj and T kj are the dielectric decrement and the relaxation time of the kj Debye term , respectively ; index k enumerates the dipole - active eigenmodes and index j enumerates interfaces . Although the measurable bulk quantities in equation ( 24 ) are directly correlated with the microscopic ( electric and shape ) parameters , a solution of the inverse problem , which aims at obtaining the microscopic information non - intrusively , from the eﬀective permittivity , is in general diﬃcult , if not impossible for the general multi - shell structure . However , biolog - ical cell has a thin and almost non - conductive membrane , and several simpliﬁcations and approximations can be made . Two Debye relaxation terms in the eﬀective permittivity ǫ sus are expected for each dipole - active eigenmode , corresponding to the two interfaces which deﬁne the membrane . 9 The ﬁrst relaxation is derived from the equivalent permittivity ( 21 ) which can be written also as Debye relaxation terms : ˜ ǫ k = ε + ∆ ε / ( 1 + iωT ) . ( 25 ) The relaxation time T that is given by the poles of ˜ ǫ k in ( 21 ) is a quite good approximation of the ﬁrst relaxation time T k 1 T = ε vac ( 1 + δ / 2 + δχ k ) ε S + δ ( 1 / 2 − χ k ) ε 1 ( 1 + δ / 2 + δχ k ) σ S + δ ( 1 / 2 − χ k ) σ 1 ≈ T k 1 . ( 26 ) The main reason is as follows . At frequencies close to 1 / T there is a huge change in ˜ ǫ k of order ε S / ( δ ( 1 / 2 − χ k ) ) , and consequently a signiﬁcant change in the total permittivity ǫ sus given by ( 23 ) . Therefore T provides an approximate value for the relaxation time T k 1 of the suspension eﬀective permittivity ǫ sus . For a non - conductive shell σ S ≈ 0 , or more precisely when σ S ≪ δ ( 1 / 2 − χ k ) σ 1 , the relaxation time ( 26 ) is : T k 1 ≈ ε vac ε S / ( δ · σ 1 ( 1 / 2 − χ k ) ) ( 27 ) showing a strong dependence on the thickness of the shell and on the shape of the particle , through the eigenvalue χ k . Due to the small parameter δ in ( 27 ) the ﬁrst relaxation ( i . e . , membrane relaxation ) tends to have a lower frequency than the second relaxation , which is present even for particles with no shell ( see the discussion below ) . In addition , cumbersome but straightforward calculations provide the dielectric decrement ∆ ε k 1 in ( 24 ) ∆ ε k 1 ≈ 4 fp k ε S ( δ ( 1 / 2 + χ k ) 2 ( 1 / 2 − χ k ) ) − 1 ( 28 ) that is very large due to the same strong dependence on the thickness of the shell . The eﬀect is even more dramatic when the second largest eigenvalue is very close to the largest eigenvalue , ( 1 / 2 − χ 2 ) → 0 , like in the case of two cells connected by tight junctions . For a suspension of shelled spheres η = 1 + ∆ R / R and δ = η 3 − 1 ≈ 3∆ R / R , where ∆ R is the thickness of the membrane , R is inner radius , and R + ∆ R is the total radius . Thus both T k 1 and ∆ ε k 1 are proportional to R and ε S and inverse proportional to ∆ R like in the Pauly - Schwan theory [ 1 , 8 ] . Moreover , the dielectric decrement ∆ ε k 1 in ( 28 ) is a generalization of equation ( 54a ) in Ref . [ 8 ] . In the same time , the relaxation time ( 27 ) diﬀers with respect to equation ( 56a ) in Ref . [ 8 ] only by the conductivity term . We will 10 show elsewhere that a more appropriate treatment of the relaxation times recovers also the relaxation time given by equation ( 54a ) in Ref . [ 8 ] . Thus , a non - conductive and thin shell / membrane produces a large relaxation of the com - plex permittivity of the suspension [ 31 ] . The experimental evidences further support these theoretical facts : when attacking the membrane with a membrane disrupting compound ( for example a detergent ) the relaxation almost vanishes as the cellular membrane is permeated [ 32 ] . For frequencies higher than 1 / T k 1 the cell permittivity is essentially determined by the dielectric properties of the cytoplasm , and does not depend on membrane’s properties . The second Debye relaxation occurs at higher frequencies than the ﬁrst ( membrane ) relaxation , and has the relaxation time T k 2 ≈ ε vac ( 1 / 2 + χ k ) ε 0 + ( 1 / 2 − χ k ) ε 1 ( 1 / 2 + χ k ) σ 0 + ( 1 / 2 − χ k ) σ 1 ( 29 ) derived from the pole of equation ( 23 ) . The corresponding dielectric decrement is ∆ ε k 2 ≈ fp k ( 1 / 2 − χ k ) ( ε 1 σ 0 − ε 0 σ 1 ) 2 × ( ( 1 / 2 + χ k ) ε 0 + ( 1 / 2 − χ k ) ε 1 ) − 1 × ( ( 1 / 2 + χ k ) σ 0 + ( 1 / 2 − χ k ) σ 1 ) − 2 The last two equations are similar to the ones that are given for spherical particles in Ref . [ 8 ] ( equations ( 46 ) and ( 49 ) in the aforementioned reference ) . The relaxation given by T k 2 is basically the relaxation of a homogenous particle embedded in a dielectric environment and was also discussed in Ref . [ 22 ] by a closely related spectral method . If the conductivity of the cytoplasm is comparable to the conductivity of the outer medium , the decrement of the second relaxation is small such that it cannot be distinguished in the spectrum . On the contrary , if the conductivity of the outer medium is much greater or smaller that that of cytoplasm , than a second observable relaxation occurs . Unlike the membrane relaxation , this second relaxation depends only weakly on the shape . By assuming that σ 0 ≪ σ 1 and by using a ﬁnite - diﬀerence method , this resonance was also obtained in [ 3 ] and it was instrumental in explaining the experimental data on the ﬁssion of yeast cells of Asami et al . [ 33 ] by Lei et al . [ 22 ] . The shape of the particle is important because it aﬀects the number of dipole - active eigenvalues and their strengths . In principle , each dipole - active eigenvalue introduces a new 11 relaxation in the dielectric spectrum , providing this relaxation is well separated from the others . A cluster with complex geometry can have several dipole - active eigenvalues , but unless the cluster is larger in one dimension then in the others , or there are tight junctions , the relaxations overlap to create broad features in the spectrum . An extra relaxation is introduced when the particles are covered by thin membranes . In addition , if ( 1 / 2 − χ k ) → 0 for that eigenvalue , then the shell induced relaxation has low frequency , large relaxation time and large dielectric decrement . Based on the spectral BIE method , it is therefore possible to explicitly relate the dielectric spectra of cell suspensions to cell’s geometry and electric parameters , and , even design ﬁtting procedures to evaluate these parameters from measurements . III . RESULTS A . Numerical procedure The calculation of the eﬀective permittivity for a suspension uses equations ( 1 ) or ( 23 ) , and reduces then to ﬁnding the eigenvalues χ k and eigenvectors | u k i and | v k i of the linear response operator M . This problem is solved by employing a ﬁnite basis of NB functions deﬁned on the surface Σ . A natural basis for a surface not far from a sphere is the generalized hyperspherical harmonics functions ˜ Y lm ( x ) = 1 p s ( x ) Y lm ( θ ( x ) , ϕ ( x ) ) , ( 30 ) where s ( x ) is related to the surface element through d Σ = s ( x ) d Ω x and d Ω x is the solid angle element . Another choice could be based on Chebyshev polynomials of the ﬁrst kind [ 29 ] ˜ T lm ( x ) = 1 p s ( x ) T l ( θ ( x ) ) e imϕ ( x ) . ( 31 ) Both bases are complete and orthogonal in the Hilbert space of square integrable functions deﬁned on Σ . In this paper , we model the linear cluster of particles as an object with axial symmetry . We seek to ﬁnd a surface of revolution for which the thickness of the interparticle joints can be varied without perturbing the overall shape of the object . We use two representations 12 for the surface Σ : ( A ) for clusters of two particles we use spherical coordinates { x , y , z } = { r ( θ ) sin θ cos φ , r ( θ ) sin θ sin φ , r ( θ ) cos θ } , and ( B ) for clusters with more than two particles we specify the surface in terms of a function g ( z ) as { x , y , z } = { g ( z ) cos φ , g ( z ) sin φ , z } . In the case B , the surface element is d Σ = g ( z ) p 1 + g ′ 2 ( z ) dzdϕ , ( 32 ) and the normal to surface Σ is n = 1 p 1 + g ′ 2 ( z )   cos ϕ sin ϕ − g ′ ( z )   . ( 33 ) In the basis of generalized hyperspherical harmonics the operator M has matrix elements given by M lm ; l ′ m ′ = δ mm ′ 2 π ZZ 0 z max ZZ z min A ( z , z ′ , ϕ − ϕ ′ ) P ml ( cos θ ( z ) ) P m ′ l ′ ( cos θ ( z ′ ) ) e im ( ϕ − ϕ ′ ) G ( z , z ′ ) dz dz ′ dϕ dϕ ′ ( 34 ) where G ( z , z ′ ) = q g ( z ) g ( z ′ ) p ( 1 + g ′ ( z ) ) ( 1 + g ′ ( z ′ ) ) − 1 , ( 35 ) and A ( z , z ′ , φ ) = ( g ( z ) − g ( z ′ ) ) cos φ − ( z − z ′ ) g ′ ( z ) [ g 2 ( z ) + g 2 ( z ′ ) − 2 g ( z ) g ( z ′ ) cos φ + ( z − z ′ ) 2 ] 3 / 2 ( 36 ) After the angle integration in equation ( 34 ) and by using the elliptic integrals given in the Appendix , the matrix elements are obtained by numerical evaluation of the resulting ( z , z ′ ) double integral using an NQ - point Gauss - Legendre quadrature [ 29 , 30 ] . Because of the integrable singularity apparent in the kernel of the operator M in equation ( 6 ) , the mesh of z must be shifted from the mesh of z ′ by a transformation which insures that there is no overlap between the two meshes . The delta symbols δ mm ′ in equation ( 34 ) reﬂects the fact that we consider only objects with rotational symmetry in this paper . Moreover , for ﬁelds parallel with the cluster axis m = 0 , while m = 1 for perpendicular ﬁelds . The convergence of the results is obtained in two steps . First , the number NQ of quadra - ture points is increased until the matrix elements of M converge , and then the size NB of 13 the basis set is increased until the relevant eigenvalues χ k and their corresponding weights p k have acquired the desired accuracy . A necessary test for convergence is the fulﬁllment of the sum rules P k P k , i = 1 and P i , k χ k P k , i = 1 / 2 with suﬃcient accuracy [ 18 , 19 ] . Usually the convergence is fast in both the number of quadrature points and the size of basis , unless the system has a tight junction where some care must be considered in order to achieve the required accuracy of the eigenmodes with the eigenvalues close to 1 / 2 . For a sphere there is just one dipole - active eigenmode which has eigenvalue χ = 1 / 6 and weight p = 1 , while for an ellipsoid there is one dipole - active eigenmode along each axis . Fast and accurate solutions are achieved for spheroids with a basis size of NB = 20 and with NQ = 64 quadrature points . In general , the size of the basis and the number of the quadrature points increase with the number of cells in the cluster and with the decreasing of the junction size . Thus , for our numerical examples a basis with NB = 35 - 40 and NQ = 128 quadrature points are enough for a converged solution in the case of the dimers and NB = 50 and NQ = 200 quadrature points in the case of the clusters with up to four cells . B . Two cells joined by tight junction The equation r ( θ ) = ( h + cos 2 θ ) / ( 1 − a cos 2 θ ) describes the shape of a two - particle cluster . Parameter h controls the tightness of the inter - particle junction and parameter a measures the deviation from a spherical shape . More precisely , h is the radius of the smallest circle at around the thinnest part of the junction . Figure 1 shows the eﬀective permittivity for a suspension of particles with the following parameters : ε 1 = 70 , σ 1 = 0 . 25 S / m , ε S = 6 , σ S = 0 , ε 0 = 81 , σ 0 = 0 . 374 S / m , volume fraction f = 0 . 05 , membrane thickness δ = 0 . 00947275 , and a = 0 . 2 . The eﬀective per - mittivity does not depend on the thickness parameter h when the stimulus electric ﬁeld is perpendicular to the cluster axis . However , a new relaxation becomes apparent as h → 0 , for parallel ﬁelds [ 3 , 25 ] . Figure 2 presents the ﬁrst 7 eigenvalues χ k and their weights P k , 1 for a ﬁeld parallel to the z axis . As the junction become tighter ( h → 0 ) more eigenvalues become dipole - active . While all eigenvalues are important in shaping the dielectric spectrum , the second largest eigenvalue χ 2 is crucial to explaining the occurrence of an additional relaxation at low frequencies , as observed for small h in [ 3 , 25 ] . Although its weight P 2 , 1 also decreases for 14 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 7 10 8 10 9 10 10 0 100 200 300 400 500 pa r , pe r p f ( Hz ) h = 0 . 5 h = 0 . 1 h = 0 . 01 h = 0 . 001 perp FIG . 1 : ( Color online ) The spectrum of the eﬀective permittivity of a suspension of dimers with various junction thickness h , and with parallel and perpendicular ﬁeld conﬁgurations . The sus - pension permittivity for an electric ﬁeld perpendicular to cluster axis does not depend on h and is pointed by an arrow . small h , this dipole active eigenmode approaches 1 / 2 as the junction becomes tighter . Thus , according to equations ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) the eﬀect of χ 2 is “enhanced” due to the presence of a nonconductive shell ( as the case for biological particles analyzed in [ 3 , 25 ] ) . Moreover , the decrease of P 2 , 1 is compensated by the increase of 1 / ( 1 / 2 − χ 2 ) . The presence of a new relaxation at low frequency along with its relationship with the size of h has been already singled out in Gheorghiu et al . [ 25 ] by using the same method but without the analysis of dipole - active eigenmodes . Using a ﬁnite discrete model [ 3 ] , the relaxation was observed before the segregation during cell division , while other papers [ 34 , 35 ] fail to relate the size of h to the new relaxation , even though one of them [ 34 ] employs essentially the same method as the one outlined in the present work . Figure 3 shows the charge distribution associated with the ﬁrst four eigenvalues for two distinct values of h . The second eigenmode is an antisymmetric combination of net charge distributions ( monopoles ) on each particle of the dimer . The third charge distribution is an antisymmetric combination of charge distributions with a dipole moment on each part of the 15 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 10 - 3 10 - 2 10 - 1 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 0 . 5 - k h P k , 1 h FIG . 2 : ( Color online ) The largest seven eigenvalues and their weights for a binary cluster with parameter a = 0 . 2 , as a function of h .

C . Clusters of more than two particles Smoother yet tight junctions would bring ( 1 / 2 − χ 2 ) closer to 0 than sharp and tight junc - tions . The reason is simple : smoother junctions have the two parts of the dimer farther apart . 17 We have analyzed linear clusters of cells connected by smooth and tight junctions by using a ( z , φ ) parameterization which describes a surface by { x = g ( z ) cos ϕ , y = g ( z ) sin ϕ , z } . The construction starts from a dimer shape that resembles the shape of the epithelial cells like MDCK ( Madin - Darby Canine Kidney ) cells . An example of such shape , displayed in ﬁgure 4 , extends from − z max to z max and it can be decomposed in three parts : the left cap ( − z max ≤ z ≤ − z 1 ) , the central part ( − z 1 ≤ z ≤ z 1 ) , and the right cap ( z 1 ≤ z ≤ z max ) . At position ± z 1 the shape function has its maximum . An m - cell linear cluster is ob - tained by repeating the central part m − 1 times and it extends from − L m to L m , where L m = z max + ( m − 2 ) z 1 . Mathematically , the shape is described by : g m ( z ) =   g ( z + ( m − 2 ) z 1 ) , for − L m ≤ z ≤ − L m + z max g ( mod ( z + ( 1 + ( − 1 ) m ) z 1 / 2 , 2 z 1 ) − z 1 ) , for − L m + z max ≤ z ≤ L m − z max g ( z − ( m − 2 ) z 1 ) , for L m ≤ z ≤ L m − z max , ( 37 ) where mod ( x , y ) is the remainder of the division of x by y . For the examples considered here , the dimer shape function is : g ( z ) = 0 . 01 + 2 . 32317 z 2 − 11 . 9862 z 4 + 40 . 4045 z 6 − 74 . 2226 z 8 + 79 . 142 z 10 − 51 . 8929 z 12 + 21 . 3096 z 14 − 5 . 35113 z 16 + 0 . 752147 z 18 − 0 . 045375 z 20 , ( 38 ) with z max = 1 . 77377 and z 1 = z max / 2 . Tables I and II list the most representative dipole - active eigenmodes for a trimer in perpendicular and parallel ﬁelds . Only the parallel ﬁeld conﬁguration has a dipole - active eigenvalue close to 1 / 2 , with a relatively small weight . The results for linear clusters of up to four particles are displayed in Figure 5 . The elec - tric parameters are the same as ones used for dimers in the previous section . An additional , distinct low - frequency relaxation emerges for clusters with more then one particles , only when the stimulus ﬁeld is parallel with the symmetry axis . The relaxation frequency de - creases , while the intensity of these relaxations increases , as the number of cluster members increases . This behavior is explained again by the combination of eigenvalues close to 1 / 2 , with thin non - conductive layers covering the cluster and is consistent with experimental data on ischemic tissues [ 11 ] , which reports that the cell separation ( closure of gap - junctions ) is responsible for decrease and eventual disappearance of the low - frequency dispersion . 18 TABLE I : Most representative dipole - active eigenmodes and their weights for the trimer in parallel ﬁeld . χ k P k , 1 0 . 4996 0 . 01305 0 . 40642 0 . 07769 0 . 40448 0 . 1391 0 . 37763 0 . 17366 0 . 26409 0 . 20519 0 . 23809 0 . 01839 0 . 17557 0 . 05104 0 . 13522 0 . 05234 0 . 12165 0 . 01066 0 . 07192 0 . 06197 0 . 06649 0 . 01239 0 . 03479 0 . 03899 0 . 03362 0 . 02823 0 . 0281 0 . 04688 0 . 02377 0 . 02519 TABLE II : Most representative dipole - active eigenmodes and their weights for the trimer in per - pendicular ﬁeld . χ k P k , 2 0 . 1831 0 . 64102 0 . 06964 0 . 01464 0 . 05492 0 . 01343 0 . 0272 0 . 01065 0 . 01674 0 . 05687 0 . 01479 0 . 13179 0 . 00395 0 . 05029 - 0 . 01635 0 . 03246 19 - 2z 1 - z max g 4 ( z ) - 3z 1 - 2z 1 - z 1 2z 1 + z max 2z 1 z 1 - z 1 z 1 z max - z max 0 0 g ( z ) FIG . 4 : Smooth construction of a cluster ( lower panel ) from a dimer ( upper panel ) . The parts determined by z ∈ [ − z 1 , z 1 ] are “glued” together with the ends of the dimer . The arrows show where the junctions will be placed in the cluster . In Figure 6 we plot P k , 1 / ( 1 / 2 − χ k ) versus ( 1 / 2 − χ k ) , which shows that the number of dipole - active eigenmodes increases with the number of particles in the cluster . According to ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) , Figure 6 shows in fact the dielectric decrement versus its corresponding relaxation frequency for each dipole - active eigenmode of the given clusters . For clusters of two or three particles , there is one important active eigenmode close to 1 / 2 , while for clusters of four particles there are two active eigenmodes . It can be conjectured that for a general linear cluster made of m particles , there are m − 1 eigenvalues close to 1 / 2 , of which the largest one is always dipole - active and has the largest 20 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 7 10 8 10 9 10 10 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 pa r , pe r p f ( Hz ) 1 cell 2 cells 3 cells 4 cells perp FIG . 5 : ( Color online ) Eﬀective permittivity for clusters ( shown in the inset ) of one , two , three , and four cells connected by tight and smooth junctions . The ﬁeld is either parallel ( solid lines with symbols ) or perpendicular ( solid lines only ) to the cluster axis . The eﬀective permittivity either increases strongly with the number of cells for parallel geometry , or does not change for a perpendicular geometry . weight . In fact one can show that for two cells connected by smooth and tight junction characterized by parameter h , ( 1 / 2 − χ 2 ) ∝ h 2 when h → 0 , or more precisely ( 1 / 2 − χ 2 ) is proportional with the solid angle encompassed by the missing part of a cell when it is connected with other cell in the dimer . The proof is based on the theorem of the solid angle [ 12 ] . The generalization to a ﬁnite cluster is also straightforward to ( 1 / 2 − χ 2 ) ∝ h 2 / m ( in that case the solid angle encompassed by the middle junction is proportional to h 2 / m . The weight of the second eigenmode is P 2 , 1 = h x · N 1 | u 2 ih v 2 | n · N 1 i / V 1 . If we consider that the surface of the cluster is determined by the function g ( z ) then , up to a constant factor , h v 2 | n · N 1 i ≈ g ( 0 ) 2 = h 2 for two cells connected by smooth and tight junctions . The proof considers that the second eigenfunction of M † is an antisymmetric combination of constant distributions on each part of the dimer . This assertion is conﬁrmed in Figure 7 . Moreover , h x · N 1 | u 2 i / V 1 is weakly dependent on h . Therefore , for a parallel setting of the ﬁeld stimulus , P 2 , 1 / ( 1 / 2 − χ 2 ) , which is the measure of the dielectric decrement of low - frequency relaxation , 21 10 - 4 10 - 3 10 - 2 10 - 1 10 0 0 10 20 30 40 50 1 c e ll 2 c e ll s 3 c e ll s 4 c e ll s P k , 1 / ( 1 / 2 - ) 1 / 2 - FIG . 6 : ( Color online ) P k , 1 / ( 1 / 2 − χ k ) versus ( 1 / 2 − χ k ) for clusters of up to four cells . The second eigenvalue has the largest contribution to intensity of relaxation . is ﬁnite and it increases when the number of cells is increased . The increase of relaxation decrement when m → ∞ is physically limited by σ S ≪ δ ( 1 / 2 − χ k ) σ 1 , since the membrane conductivity is not strictly 0 . Due to cluster’s shape and membrane properties , the variation of P k , 1 / ( 1 / 2 − χ k ) and ( 1 / 2 − χ k ) with respect the eigenmode k determines a low frequency relaxation when the dipole - active eigenvalue χ k is close to 1 / 2 . We note here that for dipole - active eigenmodes of ellipsoids the term ( 1 / 2 − χ k ) is called the depolarization factor and has analytical expression [ 37 ] . Prolate spheroids with longitudinal axis much larger than the transverse axis ( needles ) have the longitudinal depolarization factor approaching 0 and the transverse depolarization factor approaching 1 / 2 . More precisely , for a long prolate spheroid , the longitudinal depo - larization factor scales as ( 1 / 2 − χ 2 ) ∝ a 2 x / a 2 z , a z > a x = a y , as a x → 0 . On the other hand , extensive numerical calculations support the fact that cylinders with the same aspect ratio behave similarly to prolate spheroids [ 37 ] . Thus , it is not hard to observe that the low - frequency relaxation of linear clusters of cells connected by tight junctions is similar to that of a needle or a thin cylinder as long as the cluster and as thick as the junction . 22 - 3 0 3 - 1 0 1 - 0 . 6 0 . 0 0 . 6 v 1 ( z ) , v 2 ( z ) u 1 ( z ) , u 2 ( z ) z FIG . 7 : The ﬁrst ( dotted line ) and the second ( solid line ) eigenfunction of M ( upper panel ) and M † ( lower panel ) for a dimer whose shape is depicted by dashed line in the lower panel . The second eigenfunction of M † is an antisymmetric combination of almost constant distributions on each part of the dimer . 23 On the other hand , the high - frequency relaxation of the cluster shows the relaxation of a suspension of spheroids with the same volume as the volume of a single cell . Therefore the dielectric spectrum for a suspension of clusters is the same as the spectrum of a two species suspension made of thin cylinders and spheroids . IV . CONCLUSIONS We present a theoretical framework based on a spectral representation of BIE and able to calculate the dielectric behavior of linear clusters with a wide range of shapes and dielectric structures . The theory agrees with the results of Pauly and Schwan for a sphere covered with a shell [ 1 , 8 ] . In fact , for spheroids , our theory is the same as the analytical results of Asami et al . [ 2 ] . We present extensive calculations of clusters with shapes resembling MDCK cells . A practical numerical recipe to compute the eﬀective permittivity of linear clusters with arbitrary number of cells is provided . Examples are given for cluster with shapes described as r ( θ ) in spherical coordinates or using ( z , ϕ ) parameters as { x = g ( z ) cos ϕ , y = g ( z ) sin ϕ , z } . Other studies in the literature used only spherical coordinates representation [ 25 , 27 , 35 ] . A direct relation between the geometry and dielectric parameters of the cells and their dielectric behavior described by a Debye representation has been formulated for the ﬁrst time . Other work [ 22 ] , which is based on a closely related spectral method [ 18 – 21 ] , found a direct relation linking the geometry and electric parameters to the dielectric behavior only for homogenous particles . Moreover , the method used in [ 22 ] treats only particles with spheroidal geometry . We show that the spectral representation provides a straightforward evaluation of the characteristic time constants and dielectric decrements of the relaxations induced by cell membrane . We prove that the eﬀective permittivity is sensitive to the shape of the embed - ded particles , specially when the linear response operator has strong dipole active modes ( with large weights p k ) . A low - frequency and distinct relaxation occurs when the largest dipole - active eigenvalue is very close to 1 / 2 . Clusters of living cells connected by tight junctions or very long cells have such an eigenvalue . Our results also shed a new light on the understanding of recent numerical calculations [ 38 ] performed with a boundary element method on clustered cells where the low - frequency relaxation is attributed to the tight ( gap ) junctions connecting the cells . The method used in [ 38 ] does not use the confocal geometry 24 assumption . The present work has several implications and applications . We emphasize the capabilities of dielectric spectroscopy to monitor the dynamics of cellular systems , e . g . , cells during cell cycle division , using synchronized yeast cells [ 3 , 11 , 39 ] , or monolayers of interconnected cells [ 40 , 41 ] . Also the method is able to assess the dielectric behavior of linear aggregates or rouleaux of erythrocytes , where the ellipsoidal or cylindrical approximations are not adequate [ 42 , 43 ] . The proposed representation is a powerful alternative to ﬁnite element or other purely numerical approaches , because it provides the analytical framework to explain and predict the complex dielectric spectra occurring in bioengineering applications . Extension of this method to other surfaces of revolution , for example linear clusters with more than 4 particles , is straightforward providing an adequate parametric equation is available . Finally , in many cases ( e . g . shapes with high symmetry ) the method is faster , oﬀers accurate solutions and last but not least can be integrated in ﬁtting procedures to analyze experimental spectra .
