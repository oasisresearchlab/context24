To establish clathrin light chain ( CLC ) function in vivo , we engineered mice lacking CLCa , the major CLC isoform in B - lymphocytes , generating animals with CLC - deficient B cells . In CLCa - null mice , the germinal centers have fewer B cells and they are enriched for IgA - producing cells . This enhanced switch to IgA production in the absence of CLCa was attributable to increased TGF β R2 signaling resulting from defective endocytosis . Internalization of CXCR4 but not CXCR5 was affected in CLCa - null B cells and CLC depletion from cell lines affected endocytosis of δ - opioid receptor , but not β 2 - adrenergic receptor , defining a role for CLCs in uptake of a subset of signaling receptors . This first instance of clathrin subunit deletion in vertebrates demonstrates that CLCs contribute to clathrin’s role in vivo by influencing cargo selectivity , a function previously assigned exclusively to adaptor molecules . Keywords : Clathrin light chain , endocytosis , antibody isotype switch , TGF β , G - protein - coupled receptors Significance Clathrin forms coats on vesicles that control receptor endocytosis , thereby influencing cell signaling . The contribution of the clathrin light chain subunits to this process in mice was addressed by deleting the gene encoding the predominant light chain form ( CLCa ) present in B lymphocytes . CLCa - null mice have B cells with altered antibody production and aberrant development due to defects in endocytosis of signaling receptors that influence these processes . Only a subset of signaling receptors was found to depend on clathrin light chains for their endocytosis , demonstrating that light chain subunits contribute to selection of particular clathrin - ! 3 coated vesicle cargo . This study clarifies a role for the light chains in vivo , showing they contribute properties to the clathrin coat that regulate cargo uptake . Introduction Clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) influence cell signaling by selecting membrane cargo during endocytosis ( 1 ) . Clathrin consists of three clathrin heavy chain ( CHC17 ) subunits , each associated with a clathrin light chain ( CLC ) , configured into a three - legged triskelion . Clathrin triskelia self - assemble into a latticed coat that traps membrane - associated adaptor molecules , which recruit cargo into the CCV through recognition of defined protein motifs . Cargo specificity is therefore determined by adaptor binding , but recent studies in vitro have suggested that the CLC subunits can also influence cargo selection . Vertebrates have two CLC isoforms , CLCa and CLCb , encoded by separate genes , CLTA and CLTB ( 1 ) . Depletion of both isoforms from tissue culture cells by siRNA treatment showed that CLCs are not required for clathrin - mediated uptake of classic CCV cargoes such as transferrin receptor ( TfR ) , epidermal growth factor receptor or LDL - receptor ( 2 - 4 ) . CLCs were , however , implicated in uptake of three G - protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) ( 5 ) . CLCs are also required for uptake of large particles , including some viruses and bacteria ( 6 , 7 ) . These roles for CLCs in cargo selection and their general contribution to clathrin function have been a matter of speculation for some time , with indications from in vitro experiments that CLCs regulate clathrin assembly ( 8 ) and tensile strength of the clathrin lattice ( 1 , 9 ) . To assess such roles for CLCs in clathrin function in vivo , we made mutant mice that lack the CLTA gene and report their phenotype here . In mammals , CLCa and CLCb are ~ 60 % identical in protein sequence ( 1 ) . Shared sequences of 22 and 10 residues respectively , mediate binding to the actin - organizing huntingtin - interacting proteins ( mammalian Hip1 and Hip1R , yeast Sla2p ) ( 10 - 12 ) or the leucine - rich repeat kinase 2 ( LRRK2 ) ( 13 ) . Mammalian cell culture experiments and genetic studies in yeast and flies have ! 4 shown that , through these interactions , CLCs participate in several pathways that could significantly affect clathrin function in vertebrates . These include clathrin - mediated endocytosis from membranes under tension ( 14 , 15 ) , formation of clathrin - actin interfaces during cell adhesion ( 16 ) , clathrin - mediated recycling in cell migration ( 2 ) and endosome function during Drosophila eye development ( 13 ) . In vertebrates , both CLTA and CLTB gene products undergo alternative mRNA splicing to generate four possible forms of CLCa and two of CLCb ( 1 ) . Neurons express the highest molecular weight forms of both CLCs . The lowest molecular weight forms predominate in non - neuronal tissue ( 17 , 18 ) and vertebrate tissues maintain characteristic levels of CLCa and CLCb ( 17 , 19 ) . Here , using an updated quantification approach , we established that there are two CLC expression patterns , with most tissues expressing equal levels of CLCa and CLCb , while CLCa expression is dominant in lymphoid tissue . Consequently , B cells in our CLTA - knockout mice were effectively CLC - deficient , allowing us to address the functional consequence of CLC loss in vertebrates through analysis of immunological phenotypes . We observed that B cells from CLTA knockout mice had defects in internalization of transforming growth factor - β receptor 2 ( TGF β R2 ) and C - X - C chemokine receptor 4 ( CXCR4 ) . Though not all signaling receptors were affected by CLCa loss , defects in receptor internalization accounted for phenotypes observed in the knockout animals . Thus , CLCs play a significant role in cargo selection by CCVs in vivo by influencing uptake of specific signaling receptors . Results Tissues maintain characteristic CLCb levels upon CLCa loss , resulting in CLC - deficient lymphocytes . To investigate the physiological function of CLCs in vivo , we generated a CLCa null heterozygote ( CLTA ko / + ) by crossing mice with exon 1 of CLTA flanked by LoxP sites to mice expressing Cre recombinase under transcriptional control of the ACTB gene promoter ( Fig . ! 5 S1 A and B ) . Half of the homozygous CLTA ko / ko mice produced by heterozygote mating died within a week of birth . Surviving CLTA ko / ko homozygotes ( KO mice ) had no detectable CLCa protein in all tissues analyzed ( Fig . S1 C and D ) and loss of CLCa did not affect protein levels of the CHC17 subunit ( Fig . S1 D and E ) . For WT and KO mice , we quantified the amount of each CLC isoform in brain , heart , liver and spleen tissue by immunoblotting using isotype - specific antibodies ( Fig . 1 A and Fig . S1 G and H ) . As previously observed for bovine brain tissue ( 17 ) , WT murine brain tissue expressed neuronal splice variants of both CLCa and CLCb in excess of the other spliced forms of CLCs . Brain , heart and liver had equal amounts of CLCa and CLCb , while spleen expressed predominantly CLCa . Analysis of purified B and T lymphocytes detected CLCa in these cells and no CLCb protein ( Fig . 1 B ) , suggesting that the small amount of CLCb detected in spleen derived from non - lymphoid cells . B cells had more clathrin than T cells , as revealed by CHC17 and CLCa levels ( Fig . 1 B ) . We did not see compensatory increase of CLCb protein levels in the KO mice , except in liver tissue ( Fig . 1 A ) . Tissue levels of mRNA encoding each isoform and CHC17 were consistent with protein levels detected ( Fig . 1 C - E and Fig . S1 F ) . Over all , these results indicate there are two types of tissue , one with clathrin coats formed from triskelia with CLCa and CLCb , and the other in which CLCa is the predominant light chain of CCVs . Furthermore , expression of each CLC isotype appears to be independently regulated , such that B and T lymphocytes from the KO animals are effectively CLC - deficient . Genetic loss of CLCa increases the proportion of germinal center ( GC ) B cells expressing IgA but reduces numbers of GC B cells . We focused on B cell function in the KO animals to define the role of CLCs in vivo . A sign of B cell function is the formation of germinal centers ( GCs ) in follicles within the spleen and other lymphoid organs such as Peyer’s patches ( Pp ) and lymph nodes ( LNs ) ( 20 ) . In GCs , B cells proliferate and differentiate to produce higher affinity antibodies and switch isotypes ( 21 , 22 ) . We found that KO mice had an increased ! 6 frequency of IgA - expressing GC B cells in Pp compared to WT controls , as well as a variable but , on average , two - fold reduction in IgG1 - expressing B cells ( Fig . 2 A , gating shown in Fig . S2 A and B ) . To determine whether this is an intrinsic B cell defect or is caused by changes in the stroma , we studied mixed bone marrow ( BM ) chimeras produced by reconstitution of sub - lethally irradiated C57BL / 6 mice ( CD45 . 1 + ) . For each transplant , KO or WT ( CD45 . 2 + ) BM cells were combined 1 : 1 with WT C57BL / 6 ( CD45 . 1 + CD45 . 2 + ) BM cells ( B6 ) , producing KO / B6 or WT / B6 mixed chimeras . The co - transplanted B6 ( CD45 . 1 + CD45 . 2 + ) cells served as a control for transplant variation to which properties of the donor KO or WT ( CD45 . 2 + ) cells were compared . As for full KO mice , the KO donor ( CD45 . 2 + ) cells generated a greater proportion of IgA - expressing GC B cells but fewer IgG1 - expressing GC B cells than co - transplanted B6 ( CD45 . 1 + CD45 . 2 + ) cells in KO / B6 mixed chimeras ( Fig . 2 B , gating shown in Fig . S2 C and D ) . In WT / B6 mixed chimeras , donor WT ( CD45 . 2 + ) cells had similar proportions of IgA - and IgG1 - expressing GC B cells to co - transplanted B6 ( CD45 . 1 + CD45 . 2 + ) cells ( Fig . 2 B ) . The contribution of KO cells to the GC B cell population was about 50 % of their contribution to the naive follicular compartment in three lymphoid organs examined ( Fig . 2 C , gating in Fig . S2 C ) , whereas in WT / B6 chimeras , the percentage of WT ( CD45 . 2 + ) donor B cells in the GCs was similar to the follicular compartments ( Fig . 2 C ) . This reduced presence of KO B cells in the GCs suggested a defect in GC B development or maintenance , upon CLCa loss . These data from BM chimeras further indicate that the perturbations in isotype switching by KO GC B cells are lymphocyte - intrinsic defects and that CLCa is required for normal isotype class switching to IgA and IgG1 . CLCa regulates internalization and signaling of transforming growth factor β receptor 2 ( TGF β R2 ) . Selective in vivo deletion of TGF β R2 from murine B cells was shown to reduce IgA - expressing cells and increase IgG1 - expressing B cells ( 23 ) , suggesting that our KO phenotype might result from increased TGF β R2 signaling . Consistent with this hypothesis , B cells from Pp ! 7 and spleen of KO mice had higher TGF β R2 surface levels than WT mice ( Fig . 3 A and Fig . S3 A ) , while surface levels of the B cell marker , B220 , were unchanged in KO mice ( Fig . S3 A and B ) . Relative to co - transplanted B6 ( CD45 . 1 + CD45 . 2 + ) cells , elevated surface TGF β R2 was also observed for transplanted CD45 . 2 + KO B cells in the KO / B6 mixed chimeras , but not for B cells from the WT ( CD45 . 2 + ) donor in WT / B6 chimeras ( Fig . 3 B and Fig . S3 C ) . Again , a difference in surface level was not seen for B220 on KO - derived B cells ( Fig . S3 C and D ) . These BM chimera phenotypes demonstrated that dysregulation of TGF β R2 surface expression is a cell - intrinsic defect and confirm that this defect does not affect B220 . In the KO B cells , increased TGF β R2 at the B cell surface was not due to increased production of mRNA or protein ( Fig . 3 C and D ) , suggesting that clathrin - mediated endocytosis of TGF β R2 ( 24 , 25 ) is CLC - dependent . This pathway could not be studied using B cells from the KO mice because the TGF β R2 antibody signal was insufficient to assess receptor internalization . Therefore , we tested TGF β R2 uptake ( Fig . 3 E ) in HEK293T cell lines transiently transfected with TGF β R2 - IRES - GFP and co - transfected with siRNA targeting both CLCa and CLCb to recapitulate the CLC - deficient state of the KO B cells . TGF β R2 internalization was significantly reduced in CLC - depleted HEK293T cells compared to cells treated with non - targeting ( control ) siRNA and we confirmed that TGF β R2 endocytosis was impaired in cells treated with siRNA targeting CHC17 to deplete all clathrin ( 24 ) . In the same siRNA - treated TGF β R2 - transfected cells , uptake of endogenous transferrin receptor ( TfR ) was sensitive to CHC17 depletion but not CLC - dependent , as reported ( 3 ) ( Fig 3 F ) . Together our FACS and internalization studies indicate that TGF β R2 , like several GPCRs ( 5 ) , is CLC - dependent cargo for CCVs , while B220 is like the CCV cargo whose surface expression is CLC - independent . We assessed TGF β R2 signaling through Smad2 / 3 in the KO B cells because this signaling regulates class switch to IgA in B cells ( 23 , 26 - 28 ) . Smad signaling is initiated by ! 8 phosphorylation of R - Smad2 and R - Smad3 when TGF β R1 is activated by TGF β R2 binding upon TGF β R1 engagement with ligand from the TGF β superfamily ( 24 ) . Consistent with activation of this pathway , we observed elevated levels of phospho - Smad2 / 3 in splenic B cells and total splenocytes isolated from KO mice relative to cells isolated from WT mice ( Fig . 3 G and Fig . S3 E and F ) . Thus , in the presence of endogenous concentrations of TGF β , the higher levels of surface TGF β R2 lead to enhanced Smad signaling , establishing a molecular mechanism for the observed increase in B cells expressing IgA in the KO mice . CLCa influences ligand - induced uptake of CXCR4 but not CXCR5 . Since we observed increased surface TGF β R2 on KO B cells , we assessed surface levels of other receptors critical for B cell function in GCs ( 29 ) . GC B cells from Pp and mesenteric LNs ( mLNs ) of KO mice had higher surface levels of CXCR4 compared to equivalent B cells from WT controls , whereas B220 levels were not affected in the KO ( Fig . S4 A and B ) , as previously noted ( Fig . S3 A and B ) . Analysis of B cells from lymphoid compartments of BM chimeras also showed that donor KO ( CD45 . 2 + ) cells had elevated CXCR4 levels while donor WT ( CD45 . 2 + ) cells had similar levels ( Fig . 4 A and Fig . S4 C and D ) compared to co - transplanted B6 ( CD45 . 1 + CD45 . 2 + ) cells . In contrast , neither KO nor WT ( CD45 . 2 + ) donors displayed increased surface CXCR5 or B220 ( Fig . 4 A and B ) . Increased surface CXCR4 was explained by reduced internalization in response to stromal cell - derived factor 1 ( SDF1 or CXCL12 ) observed for both GC and follicular B cells from the mLNs of KO mice ( Fig . 4 C and Fig . S4 E ) compared to equivalent WT cells . Upon SDF1 exposure , KO - derived B cells from BM chimeras had consistently higher CXCR4 levels than co - transplanted B6 cells , while WT - derived GC and follicular cells had comparable levels to co - transplanted B6 cells ( Fig . S4 F ) . In contrast , B cells from KO mice exposed to CXCR5 ligand ( CXCL13 ) showed no difference in internalization response compared to B cells from WT mice ( Fig . 4 D and Fig . S4 G ) and KO - derived B cells showed comparable CXCR5 ! 9 levels to B6 - derived donor cells from BM chimeras after CXCL13 treatment , indicating no difference in CXCR5 uptake behavior by KO cells ( Fig . S4 H ) . CLC depletion from cell lines establishes selectivity for different CCV cargo . Finding that CLCa regulates the B cell surface levels of TGF β R2 and CXCR4 , but not CXCR5 and B220 , inspired us to investigate CLC dependence for uptake of other cargoes . Given that three GPCRs were previously shown to depend on CLCs for uptake ( 5 ) , we focused on two additional GPCRs , β 2 - adrenergic receptor and δ - opioid receptor known to depend on clathrin for uptake ( 30 , 31 ) , but for which the role of CLCs had not been examined . Using siRNA , HEK293 cells that stably express either N - terminally FLAG - tagged β 2 - adrenergic receptor ( F - β 2AR ) , or N - terminally FLAG - tagged δ - opioid receptor ( F - DOR ) were made CLC - deficient by CLCa and CLCb knockdown leaving residual CHC17 , or completely clathrin - deficient by CHC17 knockdown ( Fig . S5 A and B ) . Ligand - induced internalization of the tagged receptors was then assessed . CLC depletion , as well as CHC17 depletion , impaired ligand - induced endocytosis of F - DOR ( Fig . 5 A and Fig . S5 C ) . As expected , uptake of endogenous TfR was not affected by CLC depletion , though sensitive to CHC17 depletion ( Fig . 5 B and Fig . S5 D ) . Surprisingly , ligand - induced endocytosis of F - β 2AR was not affected by CLC depletion , similar to the behavior of TfR in the same cells , though internalization of both receptors was affected by CHC17 depletion ( Fig . 5 C and D and Fig . S5 E and F ) . Together , our data reveal that CLCs are required for uptake of a subset of signaling receptors , such as TGF β R2 , CXCR4 and DOR , but are dispensable for internalization of other receptors , such as β 2AR and CXCR5 . DISCUSSION We produced a CLCa - knockout mouse to probe the physiological function of CLCs . This is the first study to address clathrin subunit function in vertebrates by gene deletion , and defines a key ! 10 role for CLCs in selection of cargo for CCVs in vivo . B cells from CLCa - null mice are effectively CLC - deficient , since CLCa expression is dominant in lymphoid cells , and their phenotypes revealed that cargoes requiring CLCs for endocytosis are important for B cell function . Reduced internalization of TGF β R2 by CLCa null B cells increased Smad2 signaling at the plasma membrane , generating a higher percentage of IgA - producing B cells in KO animals compared to WT . Though IgA switching is a known consequence of TGF β signaling ( 23 , 26 - 28 ) , the role of TGF β R2 endocytosis in regulating signaling has been debated ( 24 , 32 ) . Our results support a role for CLC - dependent clathrin - mediated endocytosis in attenuating TGF β R2 signaling , since increased surface levels had the functional effect of promoting isotype switching . Our results further suggest that increased switching to IgA in the Peyer’s patch occurs at the expense of switching to IgG1 . We speculate that the elevated TGF β R signaling caused by CLCa loss dominates over signaling from factors that promote IgG1 switching ( e . g . IL4 ) . This may have been most evident in the Peyer’s patch where sufficient amounts of TGF β are available to stimulate elevated surface TGF β Rs . The reduced frequency of germinal center ( GC ) B cells in CLCa - null mice could be explained by increased surface expression and reduced internalization of CXCR4 , which plays a role in cell distribution within the GC ( 29 ) . Additionally , CLCa deficiency might affect internalization of sphingosine - 1 - phosphate receptor 2 ( S1PR2 ) , a GPCR that negatively regulates GC B cell numbers ( 33 ) , but lack of reagents to track S1PR2 surface expression prevented us from testing this . Thymocytes from the KO mice also had elevated levels of CXCR4 , but no obvious changes in T cells populations in spleen , lymph nodes or bone marrow were observed ( not shown ) , suggesting that the GC B cell defects in the bone marrow chimeras are B cell intrinsic . These results further suggest that T cells compensate more readily for surface receptor changes , having more redundant regulatory pathways than B cells as a result of their more ancient origins ( 34 ) . ! 11 Loss of CLCa from B cells did not affect CXCR5 levels or internalization . Thus , CLCs are dispensable for uptake of some GPCRs , as further observed in transfected cells , displaying CLC - dependent internalization of DOR , but not β 2AR . Our findings plus earlier observations that CLCs are required for internalization of some GPCRs ( 5 ) but not several classical CCV cargoes ( 3 , 4 ) suggest that CLCs are needed for endocytosis depending on the type and / or configuration of cargo present in a clathrin - coated pit . Variation in cargo crowding and local lipid organization affect membrane - bending properties , which in turn require different coat properties for deformation into a vesicle ( 35 ) . CLCs contribute tensile strength to the clathrin lattice through controlling rigidity of the hub region of the triskelion ( 8 , 9 ) and , in cells , by recruiting the actin - regulating Hip proteins ( 2 , 6 , 8 , 15 ) . Thus , CLCs may contribute to uptake of cargoes that pose particular membrane - bending challenges . Analogously , Sec13p in COPII - coated vesicles contributes structural rigidity that is required to bend membranes with asymmetric cargo , such as GPI - anchored receptors ( 36 ) . Two GPCR cargoes ( µ - opioid receptor and CXCR4 ) that require CLCs for endocytosis , are modified by ubiquitin , which attracts specific endocytic adaptors to promote uptake by clathrin - coated pits ( 5 , 31 , 37 ) . Such aggregation , mediated by ubiquitination or other pathways is likely to change membrane - bending properties that could then require extra tensile strength provided by CLCs in the clathrin coat . Mutagenesis studies suggest that CLC phosphorylation by GRK2 may contribute to regulation of CLC’s role in GPCR cargo selection ( 5 ) . Whether CLC phosphorylation is also involved in uptake of the CLC - dependent receptors identified here is not yet established . However , CLC - dependent TGF β R internalization was observed in the absence of ligand engagement without associated signaling . Past studies indicated that vertebrate tissues have characteristic patterns of CLCa and CLCb expression ( 17 , 19 ) . These studies used methods that could not distinguish forms of CLCa and CLCb that co - migrate by SDS - PAGE analysis . Using new isotype specific antibodies , calibrated with recombinantly - expressed protein , we show here that mice have tissues that either express ! 12 equal amounts of CLCa and CLCb ( non - lymphoid ) , or predominantly CLCa ( lymphoid ) . A remaining mystery is why , within all vertebrates , CLCa and CLCb genetic clades are clearly distinguishable and each highly conserved ( 1 ) . Recently , expression of an alternatively spliced variant of CLCa during postnatal murine heart development was reported ( 18 ) , suggesting that CLCa has specialized tissue functions , which may explain the 50 % post - natal mortality rate of the CLCa - null mice . It is notable that of the cell types analyzed here , lymphocytes are distinguished from other differentiated cell types by their lack of CLCb , which must change the nature of their clathrin . Major distinctions between lymphocytes and the other tissues examined are the lack of adherens junction or tight junction formation by lymphocytes and their persistent motility , as well as extensive cortical actin . Yeast with similar properties , function with only one CLC , which is most homologous to CLCa and is a key player in endocytosis through its association with the actin - binding Hip homologue Sla2p . This suggests that CLCa could confer a specialized actin - interacting activity that is critical for clathrin function in lymphocytes . Indeed , lymphocyte endocytosis and immune synapse formation is dependent on both clathrin and actin ( 38 , 39 ) . An alternative possible explanation for the conservation of CLC isoforms is that CLCa and CLCb influence cargo selection differently , which could also have tissue - specific and physiological consequences . Materials and Methods Production of CLCa - null mice . Our BAC targeting construct , produced by homologous recombination in E . coli , contained PGK neo flanked by FRT sites and a loxP site in intron 1 of the CLTA gene , with a second loxP site cloned into the 5’ UTR . ES cells were targeted by transfection and G418 selection to produce a floxed CLTA gene ( CLTA flox ) , then transfected with Flpe - recombinase to excise the PGK neo cassette . Targeted ES cells were injected into C57BL / 6 mouse blastocysts transferred into foster mothers . Chimeric offspring were mated with ! 13 C57BL / 6 females and germ line transmission of the CLTA flox allele established . CLTA flox / + heterozygotes were mated to ACTB - Cre deleter mice , excising exon 1 to generate the CLTA null allele ( CLTA ko ) . Heterozygous CLTA ko / + mice were backcrossed onto the C57BL / 6 background , and bred to produce CLTA ko / ko homozygous mice ( Fig . S1 B ) . Mixed bone marrow chimeras . Mixed bone marrow ( BM ) chimeric mice were generated by intravenous transfer of a 50 : 50 mixture of BM cells from two different lines of mice into CD45 . 1 + congenic C57BL / 6 mice ( 3 x 10 6 to 5 x 10 6 cells transferred per mouse ) . 50 % transferred BM was derived from CLTA ko / ko ( CD45 . 2 + ) ( KO ) mice or CLTA + / + CD45 . 2 + congenic wild - type C57BL / 6 ( WT ) mice and 50 % derived from CD45 . 1 + CD45 . 2 + congenic WT C57BL / 6 ( B6 ) , to generate KO / B6 or WT / B6 chimeric bone marrow mice . Prior to transfer , recipient mice were sub - lethally irradiated ( 2 x 450 rads , 3 hours apart ) . Mice were analyzed at least 8 weeks after reconstitution . Splenic B cell and T cell purification . Splenic B and T cells were purified by negative selection using magnetic beads . For B cell purification , spleen cells were exposed to anti - CD43 - coated beads ( MACS , Miltenyi Biotech ) . For T cell purification , spleen cells were exposed to a cocktail of biotin - conjugated antibodies ( anti - Ter119 , anti - B220 , anti - CD19 , anti - CD11b , anti - Gr1 , anti - CD11c ) followed by binding to Streptavidin MicroBeads ( MACS , Miltenyl Biotech ) . Cell purity was confirmed by FACS . Flow cytometry . Spleen , mesenteric lymph node and Peyer ' s patch cells were isolated and labeled for FACS analysis as described previously ( 29 ) . Antibodies used for GC B cell identification , immunoglobulin isotype detection , mixed bone chimeras analysis , and labeling of TGF β R2 , CXCR4 and CXCR5 are specified in the SI . Internalization assays . Internalization assays measured residual receptor remaining on the cell surface following incubation at 37°C . Percent internalization was established relative to surface labeling of cells maintained at 4°C for the duration of the experiment or relative to cells ! 14 with no ligand treatment at 37°C , as specified . Background signal of secondary labeling was subtracted separately from experimental and control signals . See SI for a detailed protocol . Statistical Analysis . Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism ( GraphPad Software , Inc ) . Parametric data were analyzed using two - tailed Student t - tests , one - way or two - way ANOVA , followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests for multiple comparisons as appropriate ( 95 % confidence interval ) .

C57BL / 6 ( B6 ) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory . CD45 . 1 + congenic B6 mice were obtained from the National Cancer Institute ( 01B96 ; B6 - LY5 . 2 / Cr ) . CD45 . 1 + CD45 . 2 + mice were generated by crossing B6 and Boy / J ( Jackson Laboratory , 002014 ; B6 . SJL - Ptprc a Pepc b / BoyJ ) mice . Mice were bred and maintained at the Laboratory Animal Research Center at UCSF . The UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal experiments . siRNAs and plasmids . siRNA duplexes were synthesized by Qiagen . Targeting sequences for CHC17 , CLCa and CLCb were as published ( 2 , 3 ) . Human TGF β R2 ( sub - cloned from pCMV5B - TGFbeta receptor II wt ( N - term HA ) , Addgene plasmid # 24801 ) was cloned into IRES - GFP in the vector PCL6IEGWO ( 40 ) . Tissue culture and transfections . HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM , supplemented with 10 % FBS ( Hyclone ) and antibiotics . For siRNA treatment , cells were plated at ~ 70 % confluency , and the following day were transfected with siRNA using the jetPRIME reagent ( PolyPlus transfection ) , according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Cells were analyzed 72 hours after transfection . For TGF β R2 internalization assays , HEK293T cells were co - transfected with siRNA and TGF β R2 - IRES - GFP using jetPRIME reagent ( PolyPlus transfection ) . Immunoblotting . Transfected HEK293 cells were solubilized in lysis buffer ( 50mM Tris ( pH 7 . 2 ) , 150mM NaCl , 20mM EDTA , 1 % Triton X - 100 , and EDTA - free protease inhibitors ( Roche ) ) and lysate produced by centrifugation to remove nuclei . Protein content of lysates was determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit ( number 23225 , Thermo Scientific ) . Proteins were resolved on pre - cast SDS - PAGE gels ( 4 - 12 % acrylamide ; Invitrogen ) , transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes ( Bio - Rad ) and detected by labeling with primary , then secondary antibodies . Blots were scanned using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System ( LI - COR Biosciences , Lincoln , NE ) , or by using the ECL system ( Amersham Biosciences ) according to the manufacturers’ protocols . Amounts of the CLC isoforms in tissues were determined by quantitative immunoblotting using a previously described protocol ( 19 ) . Murine tissues were first homogenized in lysis buffer ( 150mM NaCl , 1mM EGTA , 10mM Hepes , 0 . 5mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 02 % ! 2 NaN 3 , 0 . 05 % PMSF , pH 7 . 2 ) containing EDTA - free protease inhibitors ( Roche ) on ice and centrifuged at 1 , 000 g for 30 min at 4°C . Resulting supernatants were boiled for 10 min and centrifuged at 10 , 000 g for 10 min at 4°C . This protocol leaves boiling - resistant CLCs in solution and causes CHC and almost all other proteins to precipitate . To analyze lymphocyte subpopulations , purified splenic B and T cells were incubated in lysis buffer , then centrifuged to produce supernatant , which was not boiled . Protein concentrations of boiled or unboiled tissue or cell lysate supernatants ( homogenates ) were determined . Homogenates were then reduced in 4x sample buffer and alkylated by addition of 20mM iodoacetamide for 1 hour at room temperature . Serial dilutions of known concentrations of homogenates and of purified recombinantly expressed His - tagged human CLC proteins were run next to one another on 12 % polyacrylamide - SDS gels , and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes ( Bio - Rad ) . Membranes were first incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with Odyssey blocking buffer ( LI - COR Biosciences ) diluted 1 : 1 in PBS , and then incubated in primary antibodies overnight , followed by incubation with secondary antibodies for 1 - 2 hours after 3 - 4 washes . Signal intensities of immunoblot bands were quantified using ImageJ . The amount of CLC in each tissue or cell homogenate was then determined using a standard curve produced from signals of adjacent purified protein samples quantified in the same way . Analysis was restricted to signals from dilutions in the linear range with an R 2 value of at least 0 . 8 , except for spleen homogenate where values of 0 . 73 were used due to the limited availability of sample for titrations . For quantification of pSmad2 / 3 and Smad2 / 3 the signal intensities were normalized to the intensity of the CHC17 signals per total protein of lysate . The following primary antibodies , at the noted concentrations and dilutions , were used : mouse monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) anti - CHC17 ( 2µg / ml , TD . 1 ) ( 41 ) , MAb anti - CLCa ( 5µg / mL , X16 ) ( 41 ) or rabbit anti - CLCa ( 1 : 1000 , Proteintech ) , rabbit anti - CLCb ( 1 : 1000 , Proteintech ) , MAb anti - CLCb ( 2µg / mL , LCB . 1 ) ( 41 ) , mouse anti - β - actin ( 1 : 5000 , Sigma ) , mouse anti - α - tubulin ( 1 : 10 , 000 , Sigma ) , biotin - conjugated goat anti - mouse TGF β R2 ( 1 : 1000 , R & D ) , biotin - conjugated mouse anti - α - tubulin ( 1 : 3000 , eBiosciences ) , rabbit anti - pSmad2 / 3 ( 1 : 1000 , Cell Signaling Tech ) and rabbit anti - Smad2 ( 1 : 1000 , Life Technologies ) . Primary antibodies were detected with the following secondary antibodies or streptavidin at the dilutions indicated : donkey anti - rabbit IgG IRDye700DX ( 1 : 1000 , Rockland ) , donkey anti - mouse IgG IRDye800 ( 1 : 1000 , Rockland ) , Streptavidin IRDye 800 ( 1 : 10 , 000 , LiCor ) . For detection of anti - pSmad2 / 3 and anti - Smad2 , stabilized goat anti - rabbit IgG HRP - conjugated antibody ( 1 : 4000 , Pierce ) was used . Flow cytometry . DAPI or Fixable Viability Dye eFluor® 780 ( eBioscience ) were used to exclude the dead cells . For GC B cell identification , cells were labeled with APC - Cy7 - or ! 3 PerCPCy5 . 5 - conjugated anti - B220 ( clone RA3 - 6B2 , BioLegend ) , PerCPCy5 . 5 - or Pacific Blue - conjugated anti - IgD ( clone IA6 - 2 , BioLegend ) , PE - Cy7 – conjugated anti - CD95 ( clone Jo2 ; BD Biosciences ) , FITC or Alexa Fluor647 - conjugated anti - GL7 antigen ( T & B cell activation antigen or Ly - 77 , clone GL7 , BioLegend ) . For immunoglobulin isotype detection the following antibodies were used : anti - IgG1 ( Bio - IgG1 , BioLegend ) with Streptavidin - Brilliant Violet 605 ( BioLegend ) or FITC - IgG1 ( BioLegend ) and anti - IgA ( PE - IgA , Southern Biotech ) . To analyze mixed bone marrow chimeras , Pacific Blue - , PE - , FITC - , BV605 - conjugated anti - CD45 . 1 ( clone A20 , BioLegend ) or anti - CD45 . 2 ( clone 104 , BioLegend ) antibodies were used . For labeling TGF β R2 on murine B cells , PE - ( FAB532P , R & D ) or biotin ( BAF532 , R & D ) - conjugated anti - mouse TGF β R2 antibodies were used . Streptavidin - Brilliant Violet 605 ( BioLegend ) was used to detect the biotin - conjugated primary antibody . For CXCR4 and CXCR5 labeling , biotin - labeled - rat anti - mouse CXCR4 ( BD Biosciences ) and anti - mouse CXCR5 ( BD Biosciences ) antibodies were used . Streptavidin - Brilliant Violet 605 ( BioLegend ) was used to detect the biotin - conjugated primary antibody . Data were acquired on an LSRII flow cytometer ( BD Biosciences ) and analyzed with FlowJo ( Tree Star ) . Internalization assays . To study internalization of DOR and β 2AR , stable transfectants of HEK293 cells expressing FLAG - tagged versions of these receptors ( 30 , 31 ) were first washed with serum - free medium , and then incubated with serum - free medium for 15 minutes at 37°C . Agonist ligand ( 10µM DPDPE for DOR or isoproterenol for β 2AR ) diluted in serum - free medium was then added to the cells at specified time points , after which cells were placed at 37°C and allowed to internalize the receptor for the indicated times . Control cells were left untreated and remained at 37°C . Then , agonist - treated and control cells were immediately placed on ice and washed once with cold PBS , after which they were labeled with anti - FLAG M1 antibody ( Sigma ) directly conjugated to Alexa Fluor - 647 ( using a kit from Life Technologies ) for 30 min at 4°C . Cells were transferred to tubes by gentle pipetting , washed once with 4°C PBS , then suspended in 0 . 2 % BSA in PBS at 4°C for FACS analysis . For analysis of transferrin receptor internalization , stably transfected HEK293 cells above were serum starved and then labeled with mouse anti - TfR antibody ( 1 : 300 , BD ) diluted in 0 . 2 % BSA in PBS for 30 min at 4°C . Cells were then placed on ice , washed twice with 4°C PBS , and then maintained in 0 . 2 % BSA in PBS at 4°C for the remainder of the experiment .
