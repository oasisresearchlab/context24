The yeast Eps15 - related Arp2 / 3 complex activator , Pan1p , is essential for endocytic internalization and proper actin organi - zation . Pan1p activity is negatively regulated by Prk1 kinase phosphorylation after endocytic internalization . Phosphor - ylated Pan1p is probably then dephosphorylated in the cytosol . Pan1p is recruited to endocytic sites (cid:1) 25 s before initiation of actin polymerization , suggesting that its Arp2 / 3 complex activation activity is kept inactive during early stages of endocytosis by a yet - to - be - identiﬁed mechanism . However , how Pan1p is maintained in an inactive state is not clear . Using tandem afﬁnity puriﬁcation – tagged Pan1p , we identiﬁed End3p as a stoichiometric component of the Pan1p complex , and Sla2p , a yeast Hip1R - related protein , as a novel binding partner of Pan1p . Interestingly , Sla2p speciﬁcally inhibited Pan1p Arp2 / 3 complex activation activity in vitro . The coiled - coil region of Sla2p was important for Pan1p inhibition , and a pan1 partial loss - of - function mutant suppressed the temperature sensitivity , endocytic phenotypes , and actin phenotypes observed in sla2 (cid:1) CC mutant cells that lack the coiled - coil region . Overall , our results establish that Sla2p’s regulation of Pan1p plays an important role in controlling Pan1p - stimulated actin polymerization during endocytosis . INTRODUCTION The actin cytoskeleton plays an important role in cellular processes including cell polarity development , cell migra - tion , cytokinesis , and endocytosis . Endocytosis is critical for controlling nutrient uptake , plasma membrane homeostasis , synaptic machinery recycling , and signaling pathway regu - lation . In budding yeast , endocytosis requires dynamic in - teractions between the plasma membrane and the actin cy - toskeleton ( Engqvist - Goldstein and Drubin , 2003 ) . In both yeast and mammals , a transient burst of actin polymeriza - tion at endocytic sites is essential for endocytic internaliza - tion ( Merriﬁeld et al . , 2002 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) . Mutations in actin cytoskeletal genes , including the Arp2 / 3 complex , or treatment of yeast with the actin polymerization inhibi - tor , latrunculin A , block endocytic vesicle internalization ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ; Lappalainen and Drubin , 1997 ; Belmont and Drubin , 1998 ; Martin et al . , 2005 ) . Therefore , actin poly - merization is thought to provide force for plasma membrane invagination , vesicle scission , and / or movement into the cytoplasm ( Munn , 2001 ; Engqvist - Goldstein and Drubin , 2003 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2006 ) . Recent analyses using yeast genetics and real - time , live - cell ﬂuorescence microscopy demonstrated that proteins are recruited to endocytic sites , or cortical patches , in a highly predictable order . In yeast , clathrin is recruited to cortical patches (cid:1) 1 – 2 min before vesicle internalization ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ; Newpher et al . , 2005 ) . Early endocytic components , including Pan1p ( Eps15 - related Arp2 / 3 complex activator ) , Las17p ( yeast WASP ) , Sla1p ( an adaptor for NPFx ( 1 , 2 ) D - mediated endocytosis ) and Sla2p ( yeast Hip1R ) , then appear at cortical patches and are later joined by actin , Abp1p and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) . Abp1p , a marker for actin polymerization in cortical patches , has a patch lifetime of 10 – 15 s , whereas early endocytic compo - nents , including the Arp2 / 3 activators Pan1p and Las17p , have lifetimes ranging from 30 to 40 s ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) . Thus , the Arp2 / 3 activators Pan1p and Las17p arrive at endocytic sites (cid:1) 25 s before actin assembly is initiated . How activities of Pan1p and Las17p are regulated and how the Arp2 / 3 complex is recruited to endocytic sites are not well understood . One possibility is that the Arp2 / 3 complex binding regions of these activators are masked by interac - tions with other proteins , which dissociate in response to yet - to - be - identiﬁed stimuli , triggering activation of these activators . Las17p’s activity is inhibited by Sla1p and Bbc1p This article was published online ahead of print in MBC in Press ( http : / / www . molbiolcell . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1091 / mbc .

DC1 Supplemental Material can be found at : ( Rodal et al . , 2003 ) , and the combination of sla1 (cid:2) and bbc1 (cid:2) mutations leads to formation of dramatic actin protrusions that associate with endocytic sites ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ) . Importantly , how Pan1p activity is inhibited at early stages of endocytosis is not known . Pan1p is an essential protein that is involved in both the internalization step of endocytosis and the organization of the actin cytoskeleton ( Tang and Cai , 1996 ; Wendland et al . , 1996 ) . Pan1p interacts with many endocytic proteins , sug - gesting that Pan1p forms the core of an endocytic complex . The two Eps15 homology ( EH ) domains located at the N - terminal region of Pan1p bind to the NPF motifs of Ent1 / 2p and Yap180A / Bp , which also interact with clathrin ( Wendland and Emr , 1998 ; Wendland et al . , 1999 ) . The central coiled - coil region of Pan1p contains a WH2 - like region , which binds to ﬁlamentous actin ( Toshima et al . , 2005 ) , and a C - terminal acidic region , which binds to the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Duncan et al . , 2001 ) . Pan1p also has two N - terminal LR ( long repeat ) regions , which contain 18 Prk1p consensus phosphorylation sequences ( [ L / I / V / M ] xx [ Q / N / T / S ] xTG ) , and also interact with Sla1p and the EH domain protein End3p ( Tang et al . , 1997 ; Zeng and Cai , 1999 ; Tang et al . , 2000 ; Huang et al . , 2003 ) . The Ark1p / Prk1p kinases have been suggested to negatively regulate the Pan1p - Sla1p - End3p interaction and Pan1p’s Arp2 / 3 complex activation activity ( Zeng et al . , 2001 ; Toshima et al . , 2005 ) . Inhibition of both Ark1p and Prk1p activities caused a severe endocytic defect and abnor - mal cytoplasmic actin aggregates , and a mutant in which the Prk1p - targeted threonines in Pan1p were mutated to ala - nines exhibited a phenotype similar to the ark1 (cid:2) prk1 (cid:2) mu - tant , demonstrating that Pan1p is a key Prk1p target in vivo ( Cope et al . , 1999 ; Sekiya - Kawasaki et al . , 2003 ; Toshima et al . , 2005 ) . Moreover , phosphorylation by Prk1p inhibits Pan1p’s abilities to bind to F - actin and to activate the Arp2 / 3 com - plex ( Toshima et al . , 2005 ) . Therefore , these observations suggest that phosphoregulation of Pan1p by Prk1p is an important mechanism to shut off Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization on endocytic vesicles . Importantly , when Pan1p is dephosphorylated and whether dephosphorylation of Pan1p causes initiation of actin assembly during endocy - tosis are not known . Among early endocytic components , Sla2p arrives at cor - tical patches slightly earlier than Sla1p and is important for clathrin organization and for progression of early endocytic patches to the late stages of endocytosis ( Newpher and Lemmon , 2006 ) . Sla2p is a modular protein that is composed of an N - terminal AP180 N - terminal homology ( ANTH ) do - main that interacts with phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphos - phate [ PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ; Sun et al . , 2005 ] , a coiled - coil region that interacts with clathrin ( Henry et al . , 2002 ; Newpher and Lemmon , 2006 ) , and a C - terminal talin - like actin - binding domain ( Yang et al . , 1999 ) . Sla2p appears to regulate actin polymerization because sla2 (cid:2) cells exhibit continuous actin assembly at nonmotile endocytic sites ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) . An identical phenotype was also observed when Hip1R ( mammalian Sla2p homologue ) expression was low - ered by RNA interference ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2004 ) , suggesting that Sla2p and Hip1R share a conserved function and that these proteins negatively regulate actin assembly associated with endocytic vesicle formation . In this study , we identiﬁed Sla2p as a novel binding partner of Pan1p . Using biochemical and genetic analyses , we showed that Sla2p speciﬁcally inhibits Pan1p Arp2 / 3 complex activation activity and regulates actin assembly during endocytic vesicle internalization . MATERIALS AND METHODS Yeast Strains , Growth Conditions , and Plasmids The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 . Yeast strains were grown in standard rich media ( YPD ) or synthetic media ( SM ) supplemented with the appropriate amino acids . The carbon sources used were 2 % glucose , 2 % galactose , or 2 % rafﬁnose , depending on the experiment . C - terminal tandem afﬁnity puriﬁcation ( TAP ) or GFP tags were integrated at the endog - enous loci of the gene using the method described in Longtine et al . ( 1998 ) . The sla2 (cid:2) CC mutant was generated as follows : First , to create a sla2 integra - tion plasmid , the EcoRI fragment of the SLA2 gene was cloned into pBlue - script II SK , and the SmaI fragment of the URA3 gene was inserted into the NruI site 150 base pairs downstream of the SLA2 ORF ( PBS - SLA2 - URA3 ) . sla2 (cid:2) CC ( (cid:2) 1081 - 2187 ) was generated by ligating the NarI - digested PCR prod - uct ampliﬁed by primers 5 (cid:3) - CCGGCGCCGGCGCCCAGAAGTCCGGCTG - CATTTGTGCC - 3 (cid:3) and 5 (cid:3) - CCGGCGCCGGCGCCGAACCGTTATTGAACATAC - AATCTG - 3 (cid:3) using PBS - SLA2 - URA3 as a template . To integrate the sla2 (cid:2) CC mutant at the endogenous locus , the plasmid was digested with EcoRI and transformed into sla2 (cid:2) : : LEU2 / SLA2 diploid strains . Integrated sla2 (cid:2) CC mu - tants were selected on SC plates lacking uracil and sporulated to obtain sla2 (cid:2) CC mutants . The Yap180Ap and Ent2p expression plasmids were con - structed by inserting their ORFs into BamHI - and NotI - digested pRS426 containing the GAL1 - 10 promoter , a TEV protease recognition site , and en - coding the myc epitope ( Rodal et al . , 2003 ) . The Sla1p and End3p expression plasmids were constructed by inserting their ORFs into the BamHI site of pBS1479 ( Rigaut et al . , 1999 ) . The Prk1p and Pan1 - TAP expression plasmids were constructed as described previously ( Toshima et al . , 2005 ) . Sla2p trun - cation constructs were generated as described previously ( Yang et al . , 1999 ) . Table 1 .

Negative Regulation of Pan1p by Sla2p Vol . 18 , February 2007 659 Protein Expression and Puriﬁcation DDY1810 strains expressing the relevant plasmid were grown to saturation in 20 ml SD supplemented with all amino acids except uracil . This inoculum was added to 1 . 5 l of synthetic media with 2 % wt / vol rafﬁnose and dropout uracil and was grown to OD600 of 1 . 0 . Protein expression was induced upon addition of 30 g bacto - peptone , 15 g yeast extract , and a ﬁnal concentration of 2 % wt / vol galactose for 8 – 12 h , as described ( Toshima et al . , 2005 ) . Cells were harvested by centrifugation , washed with 500 ml water , resuspended at a 1 / 5 wt / vol ratio of yeast to water , and drop - frozen in liquid N 2 . Cells were lysed ﬁve times in a Waring blender with liquid N 2 , as described ( Goode et al . , 1999 ) . TAP - tagged proteins ( Pan1p , Sla1p , and End3p ) were puriﬁed accord - ing to the TAP method as described elsewhere ( Rigaut et al . , 1999 ) . The Pan1p - End3p complex was puriﬁed from the DDY1810 strain overexpressing both End3p and TAP - tagged Pan1p , using the same method ( Rigaut et al . , 1999 ) . TEV - myc – tagged proteins ( Yap180Ap and Ent2p ) and GST proteins were puriﬁed as described ( Duncan et al . , 2001 and Rodal et al . , 2003 , respec - tively ) . Arp2 / 3 complex ( Martin et al . , 2005 ) and yeast actin ( Goode et al . , 1999 ) were puriﬁed as described previously . Pyrene - labeled rabbit muscle actin was prepared as described elsewhere ( Cooper et al . , 1983 ) . Actin Filament Cosedimentation and Actin Assembly Assay Pan1p ( 0 . 5 (cid:2) M ) and 0 , 1 , or 2 (cid:2) M GST - fused Sla2 - CC were added to 2 (cid:2) M of assembled yeast actin , incubated for 30 min at room temperature , and cen - trifuged for 30 min in a TLA100 rotor ( Beckman , Fullerton , CA ) at 90 , 000 rpm . Pellets and supernatants were separated on 9 % SDS - PAGE gels that were subsequently stained with Coomassie blue . To measure actin assembly kinet - ics , pyrene ﬂuorescence was monitored as described previously ( Goode et al . , 1999 ) . Actin ( 2 (cid:2) M yeast monomeric actin and 0 . 1 (cid:2) M pyrene - labeled rabbit muscle actin ) was centrifuged at 90 , 000 rpm in a TLA100 rotor ( Beckman ) for 45 min to remove nuclei before use . Reaction conditions were as follows : 53 (cid:2) l actin in G - buffer ( 50 mM Tris - Cl , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , and 0 . 2 mM DTT ) was mixed rapidly with 7 (cid:2) l initiation buffer ( 250 mM KCl , 20 mM MgCl 2 , and 5 mM ATP ) and 10 (cid:2) l HEKG5 ( 20 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM EDTA , 50 mM KCl , and 5 % glycerol ) containing 10 nM Arp2 / 3 , and / or Pan1p and then immediately transferred to a cuvette in the ﬂuorometer . Fluores - cence data were collected by using a Fluoromax 3 ﬂuorometer ( Jobin - Yvon Horiba , Edison , NJ ) . Immunoblotting and In Vitro Pulldown Assay Immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously ( Toshima et al . , 2005 ) . Anti - Pan1p ( Duncan et al . , 2001 ) , anti - Sla2p ( Yang et al . , 1999 ) and anti - Act1p antibodies ( Goode et al . , 1999 ) were used at a dilution of 1 : 1000 . Immunoreactive protein bands were visualized , using a SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate System ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) . For in vitro pulldown assays , GST - Sla2 was overexpressed in DDY1810 and puriﬁed as described above . GST - Sla2 pelleted with glutathione - Sepharose beads ( GE Healthcare , Waukesha , WI ) was washed three times with wash buffer ( 10 mM Tris - Cl , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 % NP40 ) and incubated with puriﬁed Pan1p in 100 (cid:2) l binding buffer ( 10 mM Tris - Cl , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM EGTA , 1 mM EDTA , 7 . 5 % glycerol , 0 . 5 % NP40 , 10 mM (cid:3) - mercaptoethanol , 1 mM PMSF , and 0 . 5 (cid:2) g / ml leupeptin , antipain , pepstatin A , and aprotinin ) . After incubation overnight at 4°C , the precipitates were washed three times with wash buffer and used for immunoblotting . In vitro pulldown assays using other protein combinations were also performed in the same way . Fluorescence Microscopy Fluorescence microscopy was performed using an Olympus IX81 microscope equipped with a 100 (cid:4) / NA 1 . 40 ( Olympus , Melville , NY ) objective and Orca - ER cooled CCD camera ( Hamamatsu , Bridgewater , NJ ) . Simultaneous imaging of red and green ﬂuorescence was performed using an Olympus IX81 microscope , described above , and an image splitter ( Dual - View ; Optical In - sights , Tucson , AZ ) that divided the red and green components of the images with a 565 - nm dichroic mirror and passed the red component through a 630 / 50 - nm ﬁlter and the green component through a 530 / 30 - nm ﬁlter . RESULTS Localization of Phosphorylated Pan1p In Vivo In yeast and mammals , several Arp2 / 3 complex activators associate with endocytic sites where they appear to promote actin assembly ( Schafer , 2002 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2006 ; Sun et al . , 2006 ) . Our group previously showed that Eps15 - related Arp2 / 3 complex activator , Pan1p , functions redundantly with WASP - related protein , Las17p , and that these proteins are important for initiating actin assembly during yeast en - docytosis ( Duncan et al . , 2001 ; Toshima et al . , 2005 ; Sun et al . , 2006 ) . Pan1p is recruited to endocytic sites (cid:1) 25 s earlier than Abp1p ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) , a marker for actin assembly , suggesting that Pan1p’s Arp2 / 3 complex activation activity is kept inactive during early stages of endocytosis . However , how Pan1p is maintained inactive before initiation of actin assembly has not been explored . One possibility is that phosphorylated / inactive Pan1p is recruited to cortical patches and that Pan1p dephosphorylation occurs immedi - ately before the onset of actin polymerization ( Toshima et al . , 2005 ) . To test this possibility , we examined the effects of Prk1p kinase overexpression in cells . Prk1p overexpression resulted in about a 2 . 7 - fold increase in the level of Pan1p phosphorylation , and a severe growth defect that depended on Prk1p kinase activity ( Figure 1 , A and B ) . Interestingly , Figure 1 . Localization of phosphorylated Pan1p in vivo . ( A ) In vivo phosphorylation of Pan1p by Prk1p . Pan1p were precipitated with TAP - tag from cells overexpressing vector alone , Prk1 or Prk1 ( D158A ) and immunoblotted with anti - pThr or anti - Pan1p antibody . Relative phosphorylation levels are indicated under the top panel . Prk1 and Prk1 ( D158A ) were immunoprecipitated with anti - Myc antibody and immunoblotted with anti - pThr or anti - Myc antibody . ( B ) Viability of cells overexpressing Prk1 or Prk1 ( D158A ) .

The same cells as in B were grown to an OD600 of (cid:1) 0 . 3 in selective synthetic medium with 2 % rafﬁnose , and then Prk1 or Prk1 ( D158A ) was induced with 2 % galactose for 120 min . ( D ) Localization of Pan1 - 15TA - GFP in cells overexpressing Prk1 . Pan1 - 15TA cells were grown to an OD600 of (cid:1) 0 . 3 in selective synthetic medium with 2 % rafﬁnose ( left ) , and then Prk1 was induced with 2 % galactose for 120 min ( right ) . J . Toshima et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 660 Prk1p overexpression caused Pan1p to be mislocalized in the cytosol , although Pan1p cortical localization was not signiﬁcantly altered by overexpressing a kinase - dead mu - tant of Prk1p , Prk1 ( D158A ) ( Figure 1C ) . In contrast , the localization of Pan1 - 15TAp , in which 15 potential Prk1p phosphorylation sites in Pan1p were mutated to alanine ( Toshima et al . , 2005 ) , at cortical patches was not affected by Prk1 overexpression ( Figure 1D ) . These observations sug - gest that Prk1p - phosphorylated Pan1p localizes in the cy - tosol and that Pan1p dephosphorylation in the cytosol may be required for recruitment to endocytic sites . Therefore , Pan1p phosphorylation is not likely to maintain Pan1p in an inactive state during early stages of endocytosis . Puriﬁcation of Pan1p - binding Proteins To determine how Pan1p might be inactivated at cortical patches , we next investigated Pan1p protein – protein inter - actions . Pan1p is known to interact with several endocytic proteins , such as Sla1p , End3p , Ent1 / 2p , and Yap180A / Bp ( Wendland and Emr , 1998 , 1999 ; Tang et al . , 2000 ; Krogan et al . , 2006 ) . To purify the endogenous Pan1p complex , a TAP tag was fused to the C terminus of Pan1p and expressed from the endogenous PAN1 locus in a protease - deﬁcient yeast strain . Interacting proteins were identiﬁed by mass spectrometry and immunoblotting , revealing that native End3p and Pan1p appear to form a stable complex ( Figure 2A ) . To further examine the interaction between these pro - teins , we puriﬁed the Pan1p complex from yeast overex - pressing TAP - tagged full - length Pan1p in strains overex - pressing or not overexpressing End3p ( Figure 2B ) . Similar to the native complex , Pan1p and End3p were puriﬁed as a stable complex in about a 1 : 1 binding stoichiometry ( Figure 2B , right lane ) . It was previously reported that the interac - tion between Pan1p and End3p is negatively regulated by Prk1p phosphorylation ( Zeng et al . , 2001 ) . However , in our experiments , phosphorylation of the Pan1p - End3p complex by Prk1p kinase did not affect the stability of the complex ( Figure 2C ) . We previously showed that endogenous Pan1p puriﬁed from ark1 (cid:2) prk1 (cid:2) cells also makes a complex with End3p ( Toshima et al . , 2005 ) . These observations , taken to - gether , suggest that End3p can stably bind to Prk1p - phos - phorylated Pan1p , as well as to the unphosphorylated form of Pan1p . Because Sla2p appears at cortical patches at almost the same timing as Pan1p ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) , we also exam - ined whether Sla2p copuriﬁes with TAP - tagged Pan1p . In - terestingly , we identiﬁed Sla2p as a novel Pan1p - interacting protein ( Figure 2A ) . The interaction between Sla2p and Pan1p was much weaker , suggesting that this interaction might be more transient when compared with the Pan1p - End3p complex ( Figure 2A ) . Both Pan1p and Sla2p are reported to bind to F - actin , but we did not ﬁnd actin copu - rifying with TAP - tagged Pan1p , suggesting that this inter - action is not mediated by F - actin ( data not shown ) . We further conﬁrmed the Pan1p - Sla2p interaction using the yeast two - hybrid system ( Figure 2D ) . To examine the bind - ing in vitro , we performed pulldown assays with puriﬁed Pan1p and GST - Sla2p and demonstrated that Pan1p binds to Sla2p in vitro as well as in vivo ( Figure 2E ) . We next puriﬁed TAP - tagged Pan1p containing deletions of the LR regions ( (cid:2) LR12 ) , the LR regions and the coiled - coil region ( (cid:2) LR12CC ) , or the C - terminal region including the coiled - coil region ( (cid:2) CC ) ( Toshima et al . , 2005 ; Figure 2F ) and attempted to pull down GST - Sla2 with these proteins . Pan1 - (cid:2) LR12 could bind to Sla2p , but neither (cid:2) LR12CC nor (cid:2) CC bound to Sla2p ( Figure 2F ) . Therefore , Sla2p appears to bind to the central coiled - coil region of Pan1p , which contains the WH2 - like region that binds to F - actin ( Toshima et al . , 2005 ) . Figure 2 . Pan1p binds to End3p and Sla2p . ( A ) Coomassie - stained gel of TAP - tagged Pan1p and its binding proteins puriﬁed in two steps using immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) - coupled beads and S protein beads ( left panel ) .

Negative Regulation of Pan1p by Sla2p Vol . 18 , February 2007 661 Inhibition of Pan1p’s Activity by Sla2p To examine the effect of Pan1p - interacting proteins on Pan1p’s ability to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex , pyrene - actin assembly assays were performed . As reported previously ( Toshima et al . , 2005 ) , 25 nM of full - length Pan1p enhances Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization ( Figure 3A ) . How - ever , preincubation of Pan1p with 25 nM GST - Sla2p dramat - ically reduced its Arp2 / 3 activation activity , whereas GST alone , or Sla2p in the absence of Pan1p , did not affect actin assembly ( Figure 3A ) . The effect of Sla2p was speciﬁc be - cause neither Las17p , nor Abp1p activation of Arp2 / 3 was signiﬁcantly inhibited by Sla2p , even when using 100 nM Sla2p with 3 . 4 nM Las17p ( Figure 3B ) . The Pan1p - End3p complex exhibited slightly higher Arp2 / 3 activation activity than Pan1p alone ( Figure 3C ) . The activity of the Pan1p - End3p complex was also inhibited by Sla2p ( Figure 3D ) , suggesting that Sla2p regulates the native form of the Pan1p complex . To examine the effects of other previously identi - ﬁed Pan1p binding partners on Pan1p Arp2 / 3 complex ac - tivation activity , we puriﬁed Sla1p , Yap180Ap , End3p , and Ent2p ( Figure 4A ) and tested their effects on Pan1p using the pyrene - actin assembly assay . Sla1p and Yap180Ap slightly reduced Arp2 / 3 complex activation by Pan1p , but these effects were modest compared with those of Sla2p ( Figure 4 , B and C ) . Although the Pan1p - End3p complex exhibited a slightly higher activity compared with Pan1p alone ( Fig - ure 3C ) , End3p , when puriﬁed separately from Pan1p and added into the reaction , had no effect on Pan1p’s activity ( Figure 4D ) . This result might indicate that the N - terminal End3p - binding region of Pan1p was not correctly folded when puriﬁed separately from End3p and that it therefore could not form a stable complex with End3p . Ent2p had no effect on Pan1p’s activity ( Figure 4E ) . These results further support the conclusion that Sla2p speciﬁcally inhibits Pan1p’s Arp2 / 3 complex activation activity . The Coiled - Coil Region of Sla2p Binds to Pan1p and Inhibits Pan1p Activity To identify the region of Sla2p that is important for the inhibition of Pan1p’s activity , we puriﬁed GST - fused Sla2p containing deletions of the ANTH domain and the proline - rich region ( (cid:2) 33 - 360 ) , the C - terminal talin - like domain ( (cid:2) 768 - 968 ) , a part of the coiled - coil and talin - like domains ( (cid:2) 501 - 968 ) , the whole coiled - coil and talin - like domains ( (cid:2) 360 - 968 ) , or the N - terminal ANTH and the coiled - coil domains ( 33 - 750 ) ( Figure 5 , A and B ) . As shown in Figure 5C , trun - cation mutants that retained the coiled - coil region were able to fully or partially inhibit Pan1p’s activity ( also see sum - marized result in Figure 5A , right ) . In addition , deletions that lacked the coiled - coil region , Sla2 (cid:2) 360 - 968 and Sla2 (cid:2) 33 - 750 , failed to inhibit Pan1p activity . We next puriﬁed the Figure 3 . Effects of Sla2p on Pan1p - induced actin nucleation . ( A ) Pan1p - mediated Arp2 / 3 activation is inhibited by Sla2p . Graph shows assembly of 2 (cid:2) M yeast actin and 0 . 1 (cid:2) M pyrene - labeled rabbit muscle actin , with 10 nM yeast Arp2 / 3 complex and 25 nM Pan1p with or without indicated amounts of GST - Sla2p . GST or Sla2p alone was also added to the reaction as a control . ( B ) Effect of Sla2p on Las17p - or Abp1p - induced actin nucleation . Las17p with or without Sla2p was added to identical reactions of actin and Arp2 / 3 complex . ( C ) The Pan1p - End3p complex exhibits similar level of Arp2 / 3 activation activity to Pan1p .

Indicated amounts of GST - Sla2p were added to identical reactions of actin , Arp2 / 3 complex , and 50 nM Pan1p - End3p complex . J . Toshima et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 662 coiled - coil region ( 355 - 733aa ) of Sla2p ( GST - CC ; Figure 5 , A and D ) and performed in vitro binding and actin assembly assays . GST - CC directly bound to Pan1p ( Figure 5D ) and inhibited Pan1p’s Arp2 / 3 activation activity ( Figure 5E ) , although a higher concentration of GST - CC was necessary to fully inhibit Pan1p’s activity . This result suggests that either the 355 - 733aa region of Sla2p is not sufﬁcient for forming correct 3D structure of the CC region or that a slightly wider region is required for complete inhibition . A Pan1 Partial Loss - of - Function Mutation Partially Suppresses the Temperature Sensitivity of the sla2 (cid:1) Mutant Cells lacking Sla2p are temperature sensitive for growth at 34°C and exhibit abnormal actin comet tail - like structures associated with endocytic complexes at the cell cortex ( Yang et al . , 1999 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) . We have shown that Sla2p directly binds to Pan1p and inhibits its Arp2 / 3 complex activation activity in vitro . Therefore , Pan1p may be consti - tutively active in sla2 (cid:2) cells , and a Pan1p loss - of - function mutant might suppress sla2 (cid:2) mutant phenotypes . To test this possibility , we crossed two Pan1 inactive mutants , the pan1 - 101 or pan1 - KE , which impair Arp2 / 3 complex binding or F - actin binding , respectively ( Duncan et al . , 2001 ; Toshima et al . , 2005 ) , to the sla2 (cid:2) mutant . Interestingly , the pan1 - KE mutation partially suppresses the growth defect of the sla2 (cid:2) mutant at 34°C , but the pan1 - 101 mutant does not ( Figure 6A ) . This result suggests that Sla2p might inhibit Pan1p’s activity by competing with F - actin . In support of this hy - pothesis , the addition of GST - CC markedly reduced the interaction between Pan1p and F - actin ( Figure 6B ) , consis - tent with the observation that Sla2p binds to the Pan1p coiled - coil region , including the WH2 - like region ( Figure 2F ) . Because Pan1 - KEp might retain some activity , and the pan1 - KE mutation might therefore only suppress the pheno - type of the sla2 (cid:2) mutant partially , we next used a pan1 mutant that lacks both F - actin binding and Arp2 / 3 binding regions ( pan1 - (cid:2) WA ; Figure 6C ) . Immunoblotting showed that Pan1 - (cid:2) WAp is expressed at levels similar to wild - type Pan1p ( Figure 6D ) . As expected , the pan1 - (cid:2) WA mutant ex - hibited a more severe synthetic growth phenotype when combined with the arp2 - 1 mutant than either the pan1 - 101 or pan1 - KE mutants ( Figure 6E ) . However , although the pan1 - (cid:2) WA mutant suppressed the temperature sensitivity of the sla2 (cid:2) mutant a little more efﬁciently than the pan1 - KE mu - tant , the suppression was still partial ( Figure 6F ) . This result suggests that the sla2 (cid:2) mutant phenotype is caused in part by inappropriate activation of Pan1p and additionally by loss of other Sla2p functions , such as PIP2 binding via the ANTH domain ( Sun et al . , 2005 ) and / or actin binding via the talin - like domain ( McCann and Craig , 1997 ) . The pan1 - (cid:1) WA Mutant Suppresses the Temperature Sensitivity , Endocytic Defect , and Actin Phenotypes of sla2 (cid:1) CC Mutant We showed that the coiled - coil region of Sla2p inhibits Pan1p’s Arp2 / 3 complex activation activity ( Figure 5 ) . There - Figure 4 . Effects of Pan1p binding proteins on Pan1p’s activity . ( A ) Coomassie - stained gels of puriﬁed proteins . ( B – E ) Indicated amounts of Sla1p ( B ) , Yap180Ap ( C ) , End3p ( D ) , and Ent2p ( E ) were added to assembly of 2 (cid:2) M yeast actin and 0 . 1 (cid:2) M pyrene - labeled rabbit muscle actin , with 10 nM yeast Arp2 / 3 complex and 25 nM Pan1p . Negative Regulation of Pan1p by Sla2p Vol . 18 , February 2007 663 fore , a sla2 mutant lacking the coiled - coil region might result in a phenotype caused by uncontrolled Pan1p Arp2 / 3 com - plex activation . To test this possibility , we ﬁrst made a sla2 (cid:2) CC mutant that lacks amino acids 360 – 729 of Sla2p and integrated this construct into the endogenous SLA2 locus ( Figure 7A ) . Sla2 (cid:2) CCp was expressed at levels similar to the wild - type Sla2p protein ( Figure 7B ) . Although the growth rate of the sla2 (cid:2) CC mutant was similar to that of the wild - type strain at 25°C , sla2 (cid:2) CC cells exhibited a severe defect in growth at 39°C ( Figure 7C ) . Importantly , the pan1 - (cid:2) WA mutant suppressed the temperature sensitivity of the sla2 (cid:2) CC mutant at 39°C ( Figure 7C ) , and it suppressed the endocytosis defect that was observed for the sla2 (cid:2) CC mu - tant at 39°C ( Figure 7D ) . We also examined Pan1p and actin dynamics in the sla2 (cid:2) CC mutant using cells coexpressing Pan1 - GFP and Abp1 - RFP . In wild - type cells , Pan1p and Abp1p have lifetimes of (cid:1) 36 and 13 . 6 s , respectively ( Figure 7E , top panels ; Supplementary Movie 1 ) . In contrast , the sla2 (cid:2) CC mutant exhibited abnormal actin tail structures ( (cid:1) 74 . 6 % , n (cid:6) 126 patches ) and impaired Pan1p internaliza - tion into the cytosol at 37°C ( Figure 7E , center panels ; Sup - plementary Movie 1 ) , much like the sla2 (cid:2) mutant . Similar to the growth phenotype and endocytosis defect , actin tail formation ( (cid:1) 5 . 7 % , n (cid:6) 132 patches ) and the defect in Pan1p internalization were mostly suppressed by the pan1 - (cid:2) WA mutation ( Figure 7E , bottom panels ; Supplementary Movie 1 ) , suggesting that the Sla2p coiled - coil region regulates Pan1p both in vitro and in vivo . DISCUSSION Conserved Role for Hip1R / Sla2 Family Proteins in Actin Cytoskeleton Regulation In both yeast and mammals , a transient burst of actin as - sembly occurs coincident with endocytic vesicle internaliza - tion ( Merriﬁeld et al . , 2002 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) . Arp2 / 3 complex activators play a key role in actin assembly , but how activities of these proteins are regulated is poorly un - derstood . Our group previously showed that cells lacking the SLA2 gene engage in continuous actin nucleation from nonmotile endocytic sites ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) . A similar phenotype is also observed in human cells depleted of a Sla2p - related protein , Hip1R , by RNA interference ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2004 ) . These observations suggested that proteins of the Hip1R / Sla2 family might negatively regulate actin assembly during endocytosis . We showed here that Sla2p interacts with Pan1p and inhibits its Arp2 / 3 complex activation activity , possibly by preventing Pan1p’s binding to F - actin . We also showed that a Pan1p loss - of - function mutant suppressed the continuous actin assembly pheno - type observed in the sla2 (cid:2) CC mutant . Taken together , these ﬁndings clearly demonstrate that Sla2p negatively regulates Figure 5 . The coiled - coil region of Sla2p binds to Pan1p and inhibits Pan1p activity . ( A ) Diagram of GST - fused Sla2p constructs . The ANTH ( AP180 N - terminal homology ) domain , proline - rich ( PR ) , predicted coiled - coil ( CC ) , and talin - like ( TL ) regions are indicated .

Indicated amounts of GST - CC were added to identical reactions of actin and Arp2 / 3 complex . J . Toshima et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 664 Pan1p’s activity during endocytosis . Interestingly , the for - mation of abnormal actin structures observed in Hip1R - depleted human cells was shown to be suppressed by knockdown of another Arp2 / 3 complex activator , cortactin , which localizes at clathrin - coated pits and functions in clath - rin - mediated endocytosis ( Cao et al . , 2003 ; Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2004 ) . Thus , negative regulation of actin assembly by the Hip1R / Sla2 family of proteins at endocytic site is likely to be a conserved mechanism for regulating endocytic actin assembly in yeast and mammals . Possible Regulatory Mechanism for Pan1p Activation One possible factor that might regulate the interaction be - tween Pan1p and Sla2p is the lipid PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 . Our group previously showed that Sla2p directly binds to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 through the ANTH domain ( Sun et al . , 2005 ) . The ANTH domain of Sla2p is shown to be important for proper actin organization and endocytic internalization ( Sun et al . , 2005 ) , but a physiological role of the interaction of Sla2p with PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 was not identiﬁed . Yeast expresses three syn - aptojanin - like proteins ( Sjl1 , Sjl2 , and Sjl3 ) , which are phos - phoinositide phosphatases , and an sjl1 (cid:2) sjl2 (cid:2) double mutant exhibited severe defects in both actin organization and en - docytosis ( Singer - Kruger et al . , 1998 ; Simonsen et al . , 2001 ; Czech , 2003 ) . Recently , it has been reported that Sjl2p re - cruitment to endocytic sites is dependent on F - actin . Therefore PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 may be converted to PI subsequent to actin as - sembly ( Stefan et al . , 2005 ) . Interestingly , a strain lacking syn - aptojanin - like proteins , which probably overproduces PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 , induces abnormal , enlarged plasma membrane struc - tures in an actin - dependent manner , and the formation of the abnormal membrane structures is suppressed by Sla2p over - expression ( Stefan et al . , 2005 ) . These observations suggest that the accumulation of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 at endocytic sites could in - duce actin polymerization . Binding of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 to Sla2p also suggests that accumulation of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 might lead to dissociation of Sla2p from Pan1p and activation of Pan1p . Mutants of Pan1p show genetic interactions with mutants of Sjl1p ( Wendland and Emr , 1998 ) , further suggesting the impor - tance of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 regulation for Pan1p function . The coiled - coil region of Sla2p was also reported to be important for interaction with Clc1p , the light chain subunit of yeast clathrin ( Newpher and Lemmon , 2006 ) . Although a sla2 mutant lacking the coiled - coil region ( 289 - 583aa ) com - pletely disrupts Clc1p binding in vitro , the physiological role of the clathrin - Sla2p interaction has yet to be estab - lished . Our group previously showed that Sla1p patch life - time is reduced by 30 % in clc1 (cid:2) or chc1 (cid:2) cells ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ) , suggesting that the absence of mature clathrin structures could advance the timing of initiation of actin polymerization at endocytic sites . Therefore , clathrin may act as a negative regulator of the Pan1p - Sla2p interaction to control the timing of endocytic vesicle internalization . Figure 6 .

Negative Regulation of Pan1p by Sla2p Vol . 18 , February 2007 665 End3p Stably Binds to Pan1p and Functions Together with Pan1p throughout Endocytosis The association of Pan1p - Sla1p - End3p in a complex has been suggested to be negatively regulated by Prk1p ( Zeng and Cai , 1999 ; Zeng et al . , 2001 ) . However , our results showed that Pan1p stably binds to End3p and that this interaction is not affected by Prk1p phosphorylation . In a previous study , Zeng et al . ( 2001 ) showed that the phosphor - ylated Pan1p LR2 ( long repeat 2 ) fragment tagged with HA does not associate with GST - End3p . However , whether the pre - formed Pan1p - End3p complex can be dissociated by phosphorylation was not determined . In addition , Pan1p fragments containing both LR1 and LR2 regions bind to End3p about twofold more strongly than the LR2 fragment alone ( Tang et al . , 1997 ) , suggesting that the LR1 region also contributes to the strength of this interaction . Prk1p appears to phosphorylate the Pan1p complex after endocytic inter - nalization ( Sekiya - Kawasaki et al . , 2003 ) . Therefore , it fol - lows that our experimental conditions may better reﬂect the in vivo state of Pan1p - End3p . Earlier observations that Pan1p cortical patch localization decreases in end3 (cid:2) cells add further support to the importance of a stable interaction between Pan1p and End3p ( Tang et al . , 1997 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ) . Besides Pan1p , the Pan1p binding proteins , Sla1p and Ent1 / 2p , are also Prk1p substrates ( Watson et al . , 2001 ; Zeng et al . , 2001 ) . Compared with the interaction between Pan1p and End3p , the interactions of these proteins with Pan1p appear much weaker because we did not ﬁnd these pro - teins associated with TAP - tagged Pan1p . This ﬁnding suggests that these interactions might occur transiently , and potentially could be negatively regulated by Prk1p phosphorylation . Phosphoregulation of Pan1p Localization during Endocytosis Our results demonstrate that the phosphorylated form of Pan1p probably localizes in the cytosol and is dephospho - rylated by a yet - to - be - identiﬁed phosphatase . One of the candidates to regulate the dephosphorylation of Prk1p - phosphorylated endocytic proteins is the Ser / Thr protein phosphase - 1 ( PP1 / Glc7p ) . A glc7 mutant has been shown to affect cortical actin organization ( Andrews and Stark , 2000 ) . Scd5p , which is identiﬁed as a multicopy suppressor of a clathrin - deﬁcient mutant ( Nelson and Lemmon , 1993 ; Nelson et al . , 1996 ) , plays a crucial role in endocytosis and cortical actin organization ( Henry et al . , 2002 ) , and Scd5p binding to the PP1 / Glc7p is important for function ( Chang et al . , 2002 ; Henry et al . , 2002 ) . Furthermore , deletion of PRK1 sup - presses the phenotypes of an scd5 mutant that has a muta - tion in the PP1 - binding site ( Henry et al . , 2003 ; Huang et al . , 2003 ) , suggesting that Scd5p - PP1 could antagonize the func - tion of Prk1p - dependent phosphorylation of endocytic pro - teins . A recent study showed that Scd5p recruitment to the cell surface is not essential for its function , and that Scd5p / PP1 can act on its targets in the cytosol ( Chang et al . , 2006 ) . These results support our idea that phosphorylated Pan1p could be dephosphorylated in the cytosol . Pan1p Activity Is Important for Initiating Actin Assembly during Yeast Endocytosis Pan1p functions redundantly with Las17p , and these pro - teins are known to be important for endocytic internaliza - tion ( Duncan et al . , 2001 ; Toshima et al . , 2005 ; Sun et al . , 2006 ) . We previously showed that a double mutant of pan1 (cid:2) 855 - 1480 , which lacks the C - terminal region containing the Figure 7 . The pan1 (cid:2) WA mutation suppresses the temperature sensitivity , endocytic defect , and actin phenotype of sla2 (cid:2) CC mutants . ( A ) Diagram of wild - type Sla2p and the Sla2 (cid:2) CC mutant . ( B ) Immunoblots showing that Sla2 (cid:2) CC is expressed at similar levels to wild - type Sla2p .

( C ) Plates showing growth phenotypes of sla2 (cid:2) CC mutant or sla2 (cid:2) CC pan1 (cid:2) WA double mutant . Dilution series of these mutants were plated on YPD medium and incubated for 36 h at 25 or 39°C , respectively . ( D ) The pan1 (cid:2) WA mutation suppresses the endocytosis defect observed in the sla2 (cid:2) CC mutant . Lucifer yellow uptake was performed for 60 min at 39°C and was assessed by ﬂuorescence microscopy . ( E ) Left panels are single frames from a two - color movie showing Abp1 - RFP ( red ) and Pan1 - GFP ( green ) in wild - type ( top ) , sla2 (cid:2) CC ( middle ) , or sla2 (cid:2) CC pan1 (cid:2) WA ( bottom ) cells . Right panels are time series of boxed area in left panels . The time to acquire one image pair was 1 s . J . Toshima et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 666 F - actin binding and Arp2 / 3 activating sites , and the las17 (cid:2) WCA mutant , has a severe endocytic defect ( Toshima et al . , 2005 ) . However , we had not determined which step of endocytosis is impaired in the double mutant . In wild - type cells , Sla1p has a lifetime of (cid:1) 35 . 8 s , appearing at endocytic sites (cid:1) 24 . 2 s earlier than Abp1p , which has a shorter lifetime ( (cid:1) 13 . 6 s ) and is internalized into the cytosol together with Abp1p ( Supplementary Figure S1A ; Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) . The pan1 (cid:2) 855 - 1480 or las17 (cid:2) WCA single mutant extended the Sla1 - GFP lifetime ( (cid:1) 60 . 0 and (cid:1) 58 . 0 s , respectively ) and delayed actin polymerization ( (cid:1) 48 . 0 s ) at endocytic sites ( Supplementary Figures S1 , B and C ) . In addition , the dou - ble mutant of pan1 (cid:2) 855 - 1480 and las17 (cid:2) WCA exhibited a signiﬁcant delay in the initiation of actin assembly ( (cid:1) 156 . 1 s ; Supplementary Figure S1D ) . Interestingly , the double mu - tant also exhibited a severe defect in Sla1p movement , which represents invagination of the plasma membrane into the cytosol ( Supplementary Figure S1E ; Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ) . These observations indicate that Pan1p and Las17p are im - portant for initiating actin assembly and endocytic vesicle internalization . Our group previously showed that a double mutant of pan1 (cid:2) WA and las17 (cid:2) WCA exhibits a delay in the initiation of actin assembly ( (cid:1) 89 . 6 s ) , although the single mutant of pan1 - (cid:2) WA barely affected the timing of actin assembly ( Sun et al . , 2006 ) . The pan1 (cid:2) 855 - 1480 mutant likely affects a Pan1 activity in addition to the ability to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex . Compared with Las17p , Pan1p has much lower Arp2 / 3 activation activity in vitro ( Sun et al . , 2006 ) . It remains possible that a yet - to - be - identiﬁed activator of Pan1p exists and strongly activates Pan1p in vivo , just as verprolin stimulates the Arp2 / 3 - activating activity of the budding yeast type I myosin ( Geli et al . , 2000 ; Lechler et al . , 2001 ; Sirotkin et al . , 2005 ; Sun et al . , 2006 ) . In summary , our data suggest that Pan1p’s Arp2 / 3 acti - vation activity is inhibited by binding to Sla2p during early stages of endocytosis . The coiled - coil region of Sla2p binds to the F - actin – binding region of Pan1p and inhibits Pan1p’s activity . The sla2 (cid:2) CC mutant exhibited constitutive actin polymerization at endocytic sites , and the actin phenotype was suppressed by a pan1 loss - of - function mutation . Thus , these results suggest that Sla2p functions as a key regulator for initiating actin assembly during endocytic internaliza - tion . We propose that Pan1p is negatively regulated on the plasma membrane by Sla2p and on endocytic vesicles by Prk1p . It is now important to identify the positive regulators that counter the actions of Sla2p and Prk1p on Pan1p . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank Beverly Wendland for the Ent2 and Yap1801 plasmid .
