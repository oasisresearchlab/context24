Hynes , Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Cambridge , MA , December 26 , 2002 ( received for review September 10 , 2002 ) The cytoplasmic domains ( tails ) of heterodimeric integrin adhesion receptors mediate integrins’ biological functions by binding to cytoplasmic proteins . Most integrin (cid:1) tails contain one or two NPXY (cid:2) F motifs that can form (cid:1) turns . These motifs are part of a canonical recognition sequence for phosphotyrosine - binding ( PTB ) domains , protein modules that are present in a wide variety of signaling and cytoskeletal proteins . Indeed , talin and ICAP1 - (cid:2) bind to integrin (cid:1) tails by means of a PTB domain – NPXY ligand inter - action . To assess the generality of this interaction we examined the binding of a series of recombinant PTB domains to a panel of short integrin (cid:1) tails . In addition to the known integrin - binding proteins , we found that Numb ( a negative regulator of Notch signaling ) and Dok - 1 ( a signaling adaptor involved in cell migration ) and their isolated PTB domain bound to integrin tails . Furthermore , Dok - 1 physically associated with integrin (cid:2) IIb (cid:1) 3 . Mutations of the inte - grin (cid:1) tails conﬁrmed that these interactions are canonical PTB domain – ligand interactions . First , the interactions were blocked by mutation of an NPXY motif in the integrin tail . Second , integrin class - speciﬁc interactions were observed with the PTB domains of Dab , EPS8 , and tensin . We used this speciﬁcity , and a molecular model of an integrin (cid:1) tail – PTB domain interaction to predict critical interacting residues . The importance of these residues was conﬁrmed by generation of gain - and loss - of - function mutations in (cid:1) 7 and (cid:1) 3 tails . These data establish that short integrin (cid:1) tails interact with a large number of PTB domain - containing proteins through a structurally conserved mechanism . I ntegrin adhesion receptors are heterodimers of (cid:1) and (cid:2) subunits , which combine to form a large extracellular domain , two transmembrane domains ( one for each subunit ) , and a cytoplasmic domain typically composed of the short (cid:1) and (cid:2) C - terminal cytoplasmic tails ( 1 ) . Bidirectional signal transduc - tion through integrin adhesion receptors is essential for a wide variety of functions , including cell adhesion and migration , and assembly and remodeling of the extracellular matrix . Binding of intracellular proteins to integrin cytoplasmic tails is an important step in the transduction of signals to and from integrin - adhesion receptors ( 2 ) . Integrin (cid:2) cytoplasmic tails , with the exception of those of (cid:2) 4 and (cid:2) 8 , are short ( (cid:1) 60 residues ) and contain one or two NPXY or NPXY - like motifs ( Fig . 1 A ) , the first of which has the propensity to form a (cid:2) turn ( 3 ) . Such (cid:2) turn - forming sequences frequently serve to bind to phosphotyrosine - binding ( PTB ) domains ( 4 ) . NXXY motif - dependent binding of the Shc PTB domain to the large ( (cid:2) 1 , 000 residues ) (cid:2) 4 cytoplasmic tail has been observed ( 5 ) and molecular modeling studies suggested that the interaction of integrin cytoplasmic domain - associated protein ( ICAP ) 1 - (cid:1) with (cid:2) 1A ( 6 ) , and of talin with (cid:2) 3 ( 7 ) , are mediated by PTB domain - like interactions . The solved crystal structure of a complex of a talin fragment with part of the (cid:2) 3 tail verified the predicted PTB domain - like interaction ( 8 ) . Three recent publications ( 7 , 9 , 10 ) have hypothesized that other PTB domain - containing proteins may also interact with short integrin (cid:2) tails . Thus , the PTB domain – ligand interaction is hypothesized to be a structural prototype used by a variety of integrin (cid:2) tail - binding proteins . To test this hypothesis , we first queried sequence databases for predicted PTB domains and identified a number of PTB domain proteins implicated in integrin - related functions such as talin and ICAP - 1 (cid:1) . We then examined the binding of a series of recombinant PTB domains to a panel of integrin (cid:2) tails . We found that Numb ( a negative regulator of Notch signaling ) and Dok - 1 ( a signaling adaptor involved in cell migration ) and their isolated PTB domain bound to integrin tails . Additional inte - grin - class specific interactions were observed with the PTB domains of Dab ( a downstream target of c - Abl ) , EPS8 ( a regulator of Rac signaling ) , and tensin , a focal adhesion protein . Finally , by modeling the interaction of an integrin (cid:2) tail with a PTB domain based on the NMR solution structure of the Numb (cid:2) Numb - associated kinase ( Nak ) complex ( 11 ) we pre - dicted that critical determinants of the specificity of the integrin interaction were an uncharged residue at position (cid:3) 5 and a polar residue at position (cid:4) 2 relative to the Tyr of the NPXY motif . This prediction was confirmed by gain - and loss - of - function mutations . Hence , in vitro binding assays indicate that a majority of integrin (cid:2) tails interact with many PTB domain - containing proteins through a structurally conserved mechanism .

Noguchi , Kobe University School of Medicine , Kobe , Japan ) have been described . A cDNA encoding mouse Dok - 1 lacking the PTB domain ( amino acids 152 – 254 ) was generated by splice - overlap PCR and cloned into pCMV - Tag3B ( Stratagene ) to allow expression of N - terminally c - myc - tagged Dok - 1 ( (cid:5) PTB ) . Bacterial expression constructs encoding recombinant His - tagged integrin cytoplasmic tail model proteins have been described ( 15 , 16 ) . Specific (cid:2) tail mutations were introduced by QuikChange site - directed mutagenesis ( Stratagene ) and muta - tions were confirmed by DNA sequencing . Homology Search for PTB Domains . To search for proteins contain - ing putative PTB domains or related amino acid sequences , PSI - BLAST searches ( available at www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov (cid:2) blast (cid:2) ) were performed by using the peptide sequences from the PTB domain of human p72 Numb - ( 34 – 175 ) [ residue numbers refer to SWISS - PROT entry NUMB (cid:1) HUMAN ( P49757 ) ] or the PTB domain of human IRS - 1 - ( 160 – 262 ) [ SWISS - PROT : IRS1 (cid:1) HUMAN ( P35568 ) ] as queries . These searches were per - formed with Expect (cid:6) 50 , Inclusion Threshold (cid:6) 0 . 02 , and all other parameters at basic search default values . To evaluate the similarity of individual proteins identified in the PSI - BLAST searches to the consensus sequences of Shc - or IRS - 1 - related PTB domains , Conserved Domain searches ( available at www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov (cid:2) blast (cid:2) ) were performed . For Conserved Do - main searches , the partial sequences that exhibited homology to PTB domains in the PSI - BLAST searches were used as queries . Binding Assays . Binding assays using recombinant integrin tail model proteins were performed as described ( 7 , 15 , 16 ) . For binding of intact proteins , Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells were transiently transfected with 4 (cid:3) g of expression vector encoding full - length mouse Dok - 1 , or Dok - 1 mutant by using Lipofectamine ( Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY ) . Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and lysed as described ( 16 ) , and binding assays were preformed . Bound proteins were eluted in SDS - sample buffer , fractionated by SDS (cid:2) PAGE , and detected by Western blotting with anti - Dok antibodies . Immunoprecipitation . CHO cells stably expressing integrin (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 ( 17 ) , chimeric (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 where the (cid:2) 3 tail was replaced with that of (cid:2) 7 ( (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 (cid:2) 7 ) ( 18 ) , or (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 lacking the (cid:2) 3 cytoplasmic tail ( (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 (cid:5) 728 ) ( 17 ) were transfected with 4 (cid:3) g of HA - tagged Dok - 1 . Cells were lysed in ice - cold lysis buffer [ 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 (cid:2) 50 mM NaCl (cid:2) 10 mM NaF (cid:2) 1 mM sodium orthovanadate (cid:2) 0 . 5 % Igepal CA - 630 ( a Nonidet P - 40 substitute ) ] with Complete protease inhibitor mixture ( Roche Diagnostics ) . The lysates were centrifuged ( 10 , 000 (cid:7) g for 30 min at 4°C ) to remove insoluble material . Supernatant containing 1 mg of protein was incubated overnight at 4°C with anti - (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 antibody , D57 , in a total volume of 500 (cid:3) l . Fifteen microliters of protein G Sepharose beads ( Amersham Pharmacia ) was then added and mixed at 4°C for 1 h longer . Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer , and bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS - sample buffer and were fractionated by SDS (cid:2) PAGE . Dok - 1 and (cid:1) IIb were detected by immunoblotting . Structural Modeling of Integrin (cid:1) Tail – Numb PTB Domain Interactions . The NMR structure of a peptide derived from Nak in complex with the Numb PTB domain [ Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) ID code 1DDM ( 11 ) ] was used as a template to model the bound (cid:2) - integrin tails . Initial models were built by replacement of the side chains in the Nak peptide with those of integrin residues in positions (cid:3) 6 to (cid:4) 4 with respect to the Tyr or Phe of the NPXY (cid:2) F motif . The ligands where then subject to conjugate energy minimization in the presence of Numb PTB domain by using the program CNS ( 19 ) . Results and Discussion Identification of PTB Domains in Integrin - Associated Proteins . Two specific PTB domain – short integrin (cid:2) tail interactions have been predicted : (cid:2) 1A – ICAP - 1 (cid:1) ( 6 ) and (cid:2) 3 – talin F3 ( 7 ) . We and others ( 7 , 9 , 10 ) have hypothesized that PTB domain – NPXY interac - tions may mediate interactions of many signaling molecules with integrin (cid:2) cytoplasmic domains ; however , the generality of this interaction had not been demonstrated .

There are two structural classes of PTB domains : Shc - and IRS - related PTB domains . These classes lack significant primary sequence similarity , but adopt similar structures and have similar , but not identical , binding specificities ( 20 – 22 ) . We performed PSI - BLAST searches ( 23 ) by using the peptide sequences from the PTB domain of human p72 Numb - ( 34 – 175 ) , which is a Shc - related PTB domain , or the PTB domain of human IRS - 1 ( 160 – 262 ) , an IRS - related PTB domain . We also performed Conserved Domain ( 24 ) searches to evaluate the similarity of individual identified proteins to the consensus sequences of PTB domains . A number of proteins implicated in integrin function , as integrin - binding proteins , cytoskeletal proteins , or proteins involved in migration or adhesion - mediated signaling , were identified ( Tables 1 and 2 , which are published as supporting information on the PNAS web site , www . pnas . org ) . One group of PTB domain - containing proteins includes Shc ( 5 , 25 ) , ICAP - 1 (cid:1) ( 26 ) , and talin ( 27 ) , which are known to bind integrin (cid:2) tails . The interactions of ICAP - 1 (cid:1) and talin are mediated by the binding of a PTB domain to an NPXY - containing peptide sequence ( 6 , 7 ) . Another group of proteins physically interact or colocalize with integrins , but their binding to the (cid:2) tails has not been established . These include tensin and Dab1 ( Disabled - 1 ) ( 28 , 29 ) . Others are downstream targets of integrin signaling , such as Dok - 1 , which is phosphorylated following integrin - mediated adhesion and mediates cell migra - tion ( 14 , 30 ) . Thus , a number of PTB domain - containing pro - teins have functional links with , and in some cases bind directly to , integrins . Integrin Class - Specific Binding of PTB Domains to Integrin (cid:1) Tails . The presence of NPXY motifs in integrin (cid:2) tails , and of PTB domains in proteins that either bind to integrin (cid:2) tails or are likely to be involved in integrin function , led us to survey the interaction of a number of other recombinant PTB domains with a matrix of recombinant integrin - cytoplasmic tail - model proteins . We found that Numb and Dok - 1 PTB domains bound to integrin tails . Additional interactions were observed with the PTB domains of Dab1 ( a downstream target of c - Abl ) , EPS8 , and tensin . There was considerable specificity to the interactions . None of the PTB domains bound to the (cid:1) IIb tail , and none of the (cid:2) tails bound to purified GST ( Fig . 1 B ) . Most of the PTB domains bound selectively to particular integrin (cid:2) tails ( Fig . 1 B ; see Table 3 , which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site ) . (cid:2) 1A bound PTB domains from Dab1 , EPS8 , and talin and more weakly to the tensin PTB domain . In contrast , (cid:2) 7 bound specifically to tensin , Dok - 1 , and talin PTB domains . (cid:2) 2 bound only talin and Dok - 1 , and bound weakly to Dab1 PTB domains . In contrast , the (cid:2) 3 and (cid:2) 5 tails bound to all of the PTB domains tested . Thus , there was considerable specificity to the interaction of PTB domains with integrin (cid:2) tails . The foregoing studies established that PTB domains bound specifically to integrin (cid:2) tails . If these interactions were canon - ical PTB domain – peptide interactions , then they would depend on the formation of a stable (cid:2) turn at the NPXY motif ( 20 , 21 ) . To test this hypothesis , we examined the effect of Tyr to Ala substitutions within these NPXY motifs because this mutation is known to disrupt (cid:2) - turn structure in the (cid:2) 3 cytoplasmic domain ( 3 ) . Mutation of the first NPXY (cid:2) F motif in (cid:2) 1A [ (cid:2) 1A ( Y788A ) ] , (cid:2) 7 [ (cid:2) 7 ( Y778A ) ] , or (cid:2) 3 [ (cid:2) 3 ( Y747A ) ] disrupted binding of the Numb , EPS8 , Dab1 , Dok - 1 , and talin PTB domains ( Fig . 2 A – C ) , indicating that this region is important for integrin – PTB domain interactions . Most integrin (cid:2) tails have two NPXY motifs and the more C - terminal motif is implicated in binding to the ICAP - 1 (cid:1) PTB domain ( 6 ) . Consistent with a PTB domain - binding func - tion for the second NPXY - like motif , the binding of Dab1 and Dab2 PTB domains to (cid:2) 3 tails was largely unaffected by a Tyr - 747 to Ala mutation in the first NPXY motif of (cid:2) 3 , but was inhibited by Tyr - 759 to Ala mutations in the second NPXY - like motif ( Fig . 2 D ) . This inhibition was not complete , suggesting that the N - terminal motif may have some residual binding activity when the second motif is lost . Thus , the interaction of PTB domains with integrin (cid:2) tails requires the integrity of NPXY motifs in the integrin tails and is therefore likely to resemble the interactions of PTB domains with other peptide ligands . We used affinity chromatography to quantify the interaction of one of the PTB domain – integrin (cid:2) tail interactions identified above ( Fig . 3 A ) . Dok - 1 binding to the (cid:2) 3 tail was quantified by Coomassie blue staining , followed by scanning densitometry and a dose – response curve was plotted ( Fig . 3 B ) . The Dok - 1 PTB domain bound with an EC 50 of 760 nM . This finding indicates a lower affinity than that determined for the talin head domain in a similar assay format ( EC 50 (cid:6) 130 nM ; ref . 3 ) , or the isolated PTB - like domain of talin , measured by surface plasmon reso - nance ( K d (cid:6) 130 nM ; ref . 7 ) . However , it is comparable in affinity to the interaction of full - length talin with (cid:2) 3 integrin tails ( 31 , 32 ) , and appears to be of higher affinity than the (cid:2) 3 integrin – filamin interactions ( 32 ) . Furthermore the EC 50 of the Dok - 1 PTB domain – (cid:2) 3 tail interaction is within the range of affinities reported for other PTB domain – ligand interactions , e . g . , X11 – (cid:2) APP ( 33 ) , Dab1 – APP ( 34 ) , Shc – middle T antigen ( 4 ) , and Numb – Nak ( 35 , 36 ) . Thus , the binding of the Dok - 1 PTB domain to the (cid:2) 3 integrin tail is comparable with known PTB domain – ligand interactions and to other known integrin - binding proteins . Interactions of Native Proteins with Integrin (cid:1) Tails and Intact Integrins Are Mediated by PTB Domains . The preceding experiments demonstrate that isolated PTB domains can interact with inte - Fig . 2 . Tyr to Ala mutations in (cid:2) integrin cytoplasmic tails inhibit binding of PTBdomains .

Full - length talin and ICAP - 1 (cid:1) interact with integrin (cid:2) cytoplasmic domains ( 16 , 26 ) . To determine whether the binding of isolated PTB domains predicted binding of the intact protein , we examined one of the integrin – PTB domain interac - tions identified above : Dok - 1 . Recombinant full - length mouse Dok - 1 was expressed in CHO cells , cell lysates were prepared , and the binding of Dok - 1 to (cid:2) 3 tails was assessed by affinity chromatography . Dok - 1 bound to (cid:2) 3 but not to (cid:1) IIb tails ( Fig . 4 A ) . The binding was likely to be mediated by a canonical PTB domain – peptide ligand interaction because it was inhibited by mutations in the PTB domain [ Dok - 1 ( R207 , 208A ) ; ref . 37 ] , or in the (cid:2) 3 tail [ (cid:2) 3 ( Y747A ) ] , predicted to disrupt such interactions . Furthermore , Dok - 1 mutants lacking the PH domain , but not those lacking the PTB domain , could bind (cid:2) 3 tails ( Fig . 4 B ) , demonstrating the requirement for the Dok - 1 PTB domain , but not its PH domain for binding to integrin (cid:2) tails . The NPXY - dependent binding of full - length Numb to integrin (cid:2) tails was also observed ( data not shown ) . Thus , full - length PTB domain - containing proteins bind to integrin (cid:2) tails by means of their PTB domains . To demonstrate that interactions identified by using recom - binant models of integrin (cid:2) tails also occur with intact integrins , we examined the association of Dok - 1 with integrins in coim - munoprecipitation experiments . Dok - 1 coimmunoprecipitated with (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 , but not with (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 lacking the (cid:2) 3 cytoplasmic tail ( (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 (cid:5) 728 ; Fig . 4 C ) . Furthermore , if the (cid:2) 3 tail was replaced with that of (cid:2) 7 , Dok - 1 could also be coimmunoprecipitated with the chimeric (cid:1) IIb (cid:2) 3 (cid:2) 7 integrin ( Fig . 4 D ) . Thus , full - length Dok - 1 bound to intact integrins in a (cid:2) tail - dependent manner . Molecular Modeling and Mutagenesis Establish That Integrin (cid:1) Tail Binding Is Mediated by Canonical PTB Domain – Ligand Interactions . The interaction of PTB domains with integrin (cid:2) tails requires the integrity of NPXY motifs in the integrin tails . However , while the NPXY motifs are highly conserved among integrin (cid:2) tails ( Fig . 1 A ) , integrin – PTB domain interactions exhibit specificity ( Fig . 1 B ) . This result suggests that additional residues contribute to the selectivity of integrin – PTB domain interactions . As the first step toward identifying these residues , we produced molecular models of integrin (cid:2) tails bound to a PTB domain . The Numb PTB domain binds (cid:2) 3 and (cid:2) 5 tails , but binds very weakly to (cid:2) 1A , (cid:2) 2 , and (cid:2) 7 tails ( Fig . 1 B ) . The high - resolution structures of the Numb PTB domain in complex with two cognate ligands are known ( 11 ) . The Nak peptide contains a Fig . 3 . The Dok - 1 PTB domain binds integrin (cid:2) 3 tails .

Binding of Numb to (cid:2) 3 relies on the N - terminal NPXY motif of the (cid:2) 3 tail ; therefore , we modeled the structure of the region 741 – 751 of (cid:2) 3 ( Fig . 5 A ) . The most critical residues for the binding of the Nak peptide to the Numb PTB domain are Asn at (cid:3) 3 and Phe at (cid:4) 0 within the NMSF motif of the Nak peptide ( numbers are relative to the conserved Tyr or Phe of the NPXY (cid:2) F motif ; ref . 11 ) . In our model , Tyr - 747 in the (cid:2) 3 tail corresponds to Phe at (cid:4) 0 of the Nak peptide , and mutation of this residue disrupts Numb – (cid:2) 3 integrin interactions . However , the (cid:2) 1A , (cid:2) 2 , and (cid:2) 7 tails all contain Asn at the (cid:3) 3 position and Tyr at the (cid:4) 0 position , yet bind weakly to Numb , indicating that these residues do not contribute to the selectivity of binding . We therefore examined residues upstream and downstream of the NPXY (cid:2) F motif . Upstream of the NPXY (cid:2) F motif , the aromatic ring of the Phe residue at (cid:3) 5 of the Nak peptide inserts in a hydrophobic cavity , and mutation of this residue to Ala produces a moderate reduction in the affinity of the interaction ( 11 ) , suggesting that this contact is important . None of the integrin (cid:2) subunits contain a large hydrophobic residue in this position . However , whereas the Numb - binding integrins , (cid:2) 3 and (cid:2) 5 , have an Ala residue in position (cid:3) 5 , the nonbinding integrins (cid:2) 2 and (cid:2) 7 contain a polar or charged side chain , and (cid:2) 1A contains a Gly , suggesting that a nonpolar residue in this position is necessary for Numb binding . The side chains of residues (cid:3) 6 and (cid:3) 4 are predicted to be oriented toward the solvent , and are polar in all integrin tails , with the exception of Met at (cid:3) 6 in (cid:2) 5 . Therefore , positions (cid:3) 6 and (cid:3) 4 are not expected to be determinants of integrin selec - tivity in Numb binding . Nak residues C - terminal to the NMSF motif adopt a (cid:2) - turn conformation and mutation of Asp at (cid:4) 2 into Ala severely reduces binding of Nak to Numb ( 11 ) . In the Numb - binding integrins , (cid:2) 3 and (cid:2) 5 , position (cid:4) 2 is occupied by residues with charged groups , whereas in the nonbinding integrins it is a Ser . Therefore , modeling suggests that residues in positions (cid:3) 5 and (cid:4) 2 with respect to the Tyr of the NPXY (cid:2) F motif contribute to PTB - domain interactions and may play a role in the selectivity of integrin PTB domain recognition . To test this prediction we introduced mutations at the (cid:3) 5 and (cid:4) 2 positions of (cid:2) 3 and (cid:2) 7 tails and examined their PTB domain - binding activities . Loss - of - function mutations confirmed the importance of the (cid:4) 2 and (cid:3) 5 positions for integrin – PTB domain interaction . (cid:2) 3 tails containing Glu - 749 to Ser substitutions at the (cid:4) 2 position , or Ala - 742 to Asp substitutions at the (cid:3) 5 position , exhibited reduced binding to Dok - 1 and Numb PTB domains ( Fig . 5 B ) , indicating that the (cid:4) 2 and (cid:3) 5 residues of (cid:2) 3 tails contribute to PTB domain binding . Little effect on Dab1 and Dab2 binding was observed ( Fig . 5 B and data not shown ) , consistent with their binding to (cid:2) 3 primarily by means of its C - terminal NITY motif ( Fig . 2 D ) . Conversely , we mutated the same positions in the (cid:2) 7 tail to assess whether we could generate gain of PTB domain - binding function . We first replaced Asp - 773 at the (cid:3) 5 position of (cid:2) 7 tails with more hydrophobic residues . Substitution with the un - charged Ala [ (cid:2) 7 ( D773A ) ] dramatically increased Dok PTB domain binding to (cid:2) 7 tails , but had little effect on Numb or Dab2 binding ( Fig . 5 C ) . However , substitution with the more hydro - phobic Phe [ (cid:2) 7 ( D773F ) ] also increased binding of the Dab2 ( Fig . 5 C ) and Dab1 ( data not shown ) PTB domains . Substitution of Glu for Ser - 780 at the (cid:4) 2 position of (cid:2) 7 [ (cid:2) 7 ( S780E ) ] tails increased Dok - 1 PTB domain binding ( Fig . 5 C ) , but had little effect on binding to Numb or Dab2 . Therefore , both gain - and loss - of - function experiments confirmed that the residues at (cid:3) 5 and (cid:4) 2 positions of the integrin (cid:2) tails contribute to the PTB domain - binding interaction . Notably , the ability of substitutions at the (cid:3) 5 position of PTB domain ligands has previously been shown to switch binding specificity for PTB domains , both in vitro and in vivo ( 4 , 38 – 40 ) , reinforcing our conclusion that the binding of integrin (cid:2) tails to PTB domains resembles classical PTB domain – ligand interactions . Tyrosine phosphorylation of the NPXY motifs in integrin (cid:2) tails by Src family kinases is important in cell migration ( 41 ) , hemostasis ( 42 ) , and transformation ( 43 ) . PTB domain recog - nition of peptide ligands can be promoted or inhibited by NPXY phosphorylation ( 21 ) . For integrin – PTB domain interactions , the binding of talin F3 subdomain ( 7 ) and ICAP - 1 (cid:1) ( 6 ) to integrin (cid:2) tails is phosphorylation - independent , whereas the binding of Shc to the (cid:2) 3 tail is promoted by tyrosine phosphor - ylation ( 25 ) . Thus , integrin (cid:2) tail tyrosine phosphorylation may serve as switch that controls which of the alternating groups of PTB - containing proteins can bind to the integrin . A structural determinant important for PTB domain phosphate recognition is the presence of a strongly basic pocket ( 11 ) . This pocket typically contains two arginine residues that coordinate the phosphate moiety of the NPXpY ligand . Integrin (cid:2) tail phos - phorylation blocks interactions with talin ( 44 ) , and the pocket in the talin PTB domain lacks these arginines . Instead , (cid:2) 3 Tyr - 747 points into an acidic and hydrophobic pocket formed by the ends Fig . 5 . Mutations in (cid:2) integrin cytoplasmic tails alter PTB domain - binding speciﬁcity . ( A ) Structural modeling of the interaction between the Numb PTB domain and the (cid:2) 3 integrin cytoplasmic tail . A model of (cid:2) 3 residues Thr - 741 toThr - 751dockedintheNumb - PTBdomainbindingsitewasgeneratedbased on the structure of the Numb – Nak complex . ( B ) Introduction of a charged residue at the (cid:3) 5 position and a noncharged residue at the (cid:4) 2 position relative to the Tyr or the (cid:2) 3 NPXY motif inhibit PTB domain binding . GST - PTB domain fusion proteins were incubated with beads coated with recombinant (cid:2) 3 , (cid:2) 3 ( E749S ) , or (cid:2) 3 ( A742D ) tails . Bound proteins were fractionated by SDS (cid:2) PAGEandGST - PTBdomainsweredetectedbyWesternblottingwithanti - GST antibodies . Loading of the recombinant integrin tails on the beads was assessedbyCoomassiebluestaining . ( C ) Introductionofanunchargedresidue atthe (cid:3) 5positionandachargedresidueatthe (cid:4) 2positionrelativetotheTyr or the (cid:2) 7 NPXY motif enhances PTB domain binding . The binding of recom - binant GST - PTB domain fusion proteins to (cid:2) 7 , (cid:2) 7 ( S780E ) , (cid:2) 7 ( D773A ) , or (cid:2) 7 ( D773F ) integrin cytoplasmic tails was assessed as described in B . 2276 (cid:3) www . pnas . org (cid:2) cgi (cid:2) doi (cid:2) 10 . 1073 (cid:2) pnas . 262791999 Calderwood et al . of two (cid:2) strands of the PTB domain on one side , and a reverse turn of the integrin (cid:2) tail on the other ( 8 ) . Thus , the nature of this binding pocket in the PTB domain protein is predicted to specify the effect of integrin - tyrosine phosphorylation on the particular integrin - binding partner . Here we have demonstrated that PTB domains from 17 different proteins ( Table 3 ) can bind integrin (cid:2) tails in vitro , and furthermore , full - length PTB domain - containing proteins can bind integrin (cid:2) tails in pull - down and coimmunoprecipitation assays . There are a large number of PTB domain - containing proteins [ at least 58 in humans ( 45 ) ] , plus many FERM ( band 4 . 1 and ezrin (cid:2) radixin (cid:2) moesin ) domain , PTB - like domain - contain - ing proteins [ 85 in humans ( 45 ) ] , in addition to those studied here . Thus , the remarkable conservation of the NPXY (cid:2) F motif in integrin (cid:2) subunits and its role in interaction with a number of PTB domains suggests that this interaction is paradigmatic for a wide variety of integrin - signaling events . Further work will be needed to test the roles of PTB domain – integrin interactions in vivo , using endogenous proteins . However , based on the results reported here , we propose general principles of integrin – cytoplasmic protein interaction : ( i ) Integrin (cid:2) cytoplasmic do - mains use their conserved NPXY (cid:2) F motifs to bind to cytoplas - mic proteins that contain PTB ( or PTB - like ) modules . ( ii ) The nature of the integrin (cid:2) tail residues at the (cid:3) 5 and (cid:4) 2 positions ( relative to the Tyr (cid:2) Phe of NPXY (cid:2) F motif ) specifies preferential interaction with PTB domains . ( iii ) Integrin phosphorylation - regulated changes in PTB domain - binding specificity are mo - lecular toggle switches that designate biological responses to integrin - dependent adhesion . These general principles of inte - grin interaction with cytoplasmic proteins may provide useful algorithms for deciphering the integrin - signaling code .
