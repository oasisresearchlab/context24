Mass spectrometry has evolved at an exponential rate over the last 100 years . Innovations in the development of mass spectrometers have created powerful instruments 16 capable of analyzing a wide range of targets , from rare atoms and molecules to very large molecules such as a proteins , protein complexes and DNA . These performance gains have 18 been driven by sustaining innovations , punctuated by the occasional disruptive innovation . The use of mass spectrometry for proteome analysis was driven by disruptive innovations that 20 created a capability for large - scale analysis of proteins and modifications . 22 Page 1 of 32 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of the American Chemical Society 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 2 Proteins are linear polymers created from a set of 20 amino acids encoded in DNA . If the amino acid sequence of a protein was sufficient to explain its role in biological processes , then there 24 would be no need for protein analysis methods since sequences can be determined quite efficiently with DNA sequencing techniques . In fact , in 1978 Malcolm predicted that DNA 26 sequencing methods would result in the “decline and fall of protein chemistry” , a prophecy that has not come true , in part , because a protein’s function or role must be determined in its 28 individual context and in the context of molecular and cellular systems 1 . The function of a protein can be dictated by its molecular interactions , by its location in the cell , by its time or level 30 of expression or by its modification state . Malcolm , in a sense , was correct that DNA sequencing methods would lead to transformational changes in the biological sciences , but he , 32 like everybody else at the time , did not envision a global effort to sequence the human genome and the genomes of model organisms , or the far reaching consequences of such an effort . 34 When the Human Genome Project was proposed it was expected to benefit research in genetics and medicine and to accelerate the discovery of the causes of disease , but no one 36 anticipated that protein analysis would also benefit from genome data . Despite the promise of the Human Genome Project , it quickly became clear that genetic data alone does not provide 38 sufficient insight into the mechanisms of diseases to effect cures , and that even simple genetic mutations such as the deleted Phe at position 508 ( ∆ F508 ) in the Cystic Fibrosis Transport 40 Regulator ( CFTR ) protein create complicated biology that has taken 20 + years to unravel 2 . Nevertheless , genome sequences unexpectedly created a resource for mass spectrometry that 42 has accelerated the pace of biological research . The Evolution of Shotgun Proteomics ( From Amino Acids to Proteomes ) 44 Mass spectrometry has evolved at an exponential rate over the last 100 years . 3 Some of this evolution has been driven by innovations in the machining , electronic and computer industries 46 which created higher performance components for mass spectrometers , and these improvements have resulted in steady performance gains . However , bigger gains have come 48 from the occasional disruptive innovations - technological innovations which are transformational - that created entirely new levels of scale and capability . Large - scale analysis 50 of proteins or proteomics was made possible by a collection of disruptive innovations driving the field at a fast moving pace . 52 After mass spectrometers were shown to be capable of analyzing organic molecules , it was natural to look to amino acids and small peptides as the next target . Amino acid and peptide 54 Page 2 of 32 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of the American Chemical Society 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 3 analysis was complicated by the lack of volatility of these zwitterionic and polar molecules and by the mass range of early mass spectrometers . To overcome this problem , clever use of 56 derivatization allowed evaporation of the modified amino acids and small peptides off a solids probe into an EI source where fragmentation patterns permitted determination of the peptide 58 sequence 4 , 5 . As high resolution , accurate mass instruments emerged , accurate mass was used as a tool for sequence analysis of small peptides 6 . The ability to analyze small peptides led to 60 the analysis of proteins using enzymatic digestion and acid hydrolysis of the intact protein to produce peptides small enough to be analyzed by the mass spectrometer 6 . By generating 62 overlapping peptide fragments , the sequence of the protein could be reconstructed . Clearly , this strategy produced complicated mixtures of peptides that would require advances in separation 64 technology and fortuitously concurrent innovations in gas chromatography ( GC ) provided a means to separate peptides using the same derivatization chemistry employed for mass 66 spectrometry . It wasn’t long before GC was interfaced with MS to allow simultaneous separation and structural analysis 7 and using this strategy some impressive protein sequencing 68 results were achieved 8 . Alternative strategies also emerged that made use of derivatization chemistries such as permethylation , enabling the analysis of longer peptides , which were often 70 too involatile to be separated by GC , but could be fractionally distilled off a solids probe 9 . As DNA sequencing methods emerged , GCMS analysis of peptides was used to check the 72 accuracy of DNA derived sequences and to establish the correct reading frame 10 . Errors in the middle of the DNA sequence could shift the reading frame , making parts of the sequence 74 incorrect . The greatest challenge of the time was the ionization of peptides without the laborious derivatization steps since these steps meant that applications were limited to abundant 76 proteins . A major disruptive innovation occurred in 1981 with the development of Fast Atom 78 Bombardment ( FAB ) 11 , 12 . For the first time peptides could be robustly ionized without modification and very large peptides ( > 1 - 2K Da ) could be ionized . This innovation set off a 80 drive to increase the mass range of mass spectrometers . FAB ionization was also energetic enough to activate some peptide ions to dissociate and produce low abundance fragmentation , 82 often generating enough information to determine the amino acid sequence of a pure peptide 12 . Proteins could be sequenced using this approach by first purifying peptides from proteolytic 84 digestion and then subjecting them to FAB - MS to derive sequence ions 13 . Some peptides would fragment well during FAB , but many would not . Within a few months of the introduction of FAB , 86 Hunt et al integrated this new ionization technique with tandem mass spectrometry to create a Page 3 of 32 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of the American Chemical Society 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 4 robust method to sequence peptides 14 . This method circumvented several problems : it 88 eliminated the need to purify peptides to homogeneity , it generalized fragmentation through collision induced dissociation ( CID ) , and it improved signal to noise in the product ion spectrum 90 by eliminating the high level of chemical noise created by FAB . Hunt also integrated the use of HPLC to separate proteolytically digested proteins by collecting fractions with off - line HPLC and 92 then analyzing peptides by FAB - MSMS 15 . Tandem mass spectrometry data for peptides was then manually interpreted , which limited the throughput of the approach . Data could be collected 94 very quickly , but interpretation was slow and complicated . The approach developed by Hunt et al which comprises digesting intact proteins , separating peptides by HPLC and then sequencing 96 the peptides by tandem mass spectrometry is essentially the strategy used today for bottom - up proteomics . 98 While FAB - MS and MSMS were big breakthroughs for peptide and protein analysis , they were limited by difficulty interfacing them directly with liquid separations . A method called continuous 100 flow FAB was developed as an interface to HPLC , but the method was not robust and was never widely used 16 , 17 . In 1989 Fenn et al demonstrated electrospray ionization on proteins 18 . 102 An extraordinary feature of the method was the ability to ionize large proteins and measure m / z ratios accurately in the mass spectrometer , but another valuable feature of the method was 104 ionization at atmospheric pressure , which simplified interfacing liquid separations to the mass spectrometer . Smith et al very quickly implemented ESI to interface capillary electrophoresis to 106 MS to demonstrate this feature 19 . ESI was clearly a disruptive innovation as FAB literally disappeared from mainstream use within a few years . 108 A clear benefit of ESI could be a more efficient sequencing strategy for peptides and proteins , although initial enthusiasm revolved around measuring the masses of intact proteins 20 . Several 110 groups devised strategies for liquid chromatography of peptides , but a powerful synergy was found between ESI and the microscale packed capillary columns of Novotny and Jorgenson 21 , 22 . 112 ESI is a concentration sensitive ionization method , so the low flow rate associated with capillary chromatography resulted in big gains in signal . Hunt et al devised a nanoLC ESI tandem mass 114 spectrometry method to sequence peptides isolated from MHC proteins based on the previously developed FAB - MSMS strategy 23 . A drawback to this approach was the need to manually 116 select ions for MSMS , necessitating two analyses ; one to identify peptide ion m / z values and a second to select ions for MSMS . This approach limited the number of ions that could be 118 selected in a single analysis . To improve on this process a “peak parking” technique was used that slowed the flow rate of the HPLC effluent to allow more time to collect MSMS . 23 , 24 Clearly , 120 Page 4 of 32 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of the American Chemical Society 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 5 automating the process to collect tandem mass spectra would increase the efficiency of the process . 122 Instrument Control Language ( ICL ) was a unique and disruptive innovation which was developed by Sokolow et al at Finnigan MAT and first appeared on the Finnigan MAT TSQ70 . 25 124 ICL could be used to create computer programs to interact with data and control operation of the instrument based on that data in real time . 26 , 27 ICL allowed automated data acquisition and 126 imbued it with a level of crude “intelligence” . Davis et al created methods to automatically collect tandem mass spectra of peptides by first surveying the m / z values present in a scan and 128 then selecting m / z values for MSMS based on their abundance levels 27 . The program would quickly set up the instrument for an MSMS experiment , collect 2 or 3 MS / MS and then resume 130 MS1 scans to find more m / z values . Other ICL applications quickly followed . For instance , Yates et al designed an experiment to collect MSMS data on phosphopeptides based on a 132 neutral loss scan to detect the loss of phosphoric acid from phospho - Ser and – Thr and then collecting MSMS data on those peptide ions exhibiting the neutral loss . 26 ICL proved to be an 134 enabling and disruptive innovation which increased the efficiency of MSMS and other experiments and made large - scale proteomics possible . It is now standard technology on all 136 mass spectrometers used for proteomics . In 1990 the DOE and NIH presented a joint plan to the US Congress to sequence the human 138 genome 28 . By design , the collection of new human genome sequences was slow in the initial phases of the project while technology development and the collection of DNA sequence from 140 several model organisms , notably E . coli , S . cerevisiae , D . melanogaster and C . elegans , and mouse , were pursued 29 . Databases started to fill with DNA sequence information and 142 bioinformatic algorithms for mining the data proliferated . In 1994 a seminal method for automated analysis of peptide tandem mass spectrometry data emerged that involved 144 searching MSMS data using the sequences being generated by genome sequencing projects 30 . This method solved the long standing problem of rapid and accurate interpretation of 146 tandem mass spectrometry peptide data . Further work showed the method could be used to identify modifications to peptides that are not represented in databases and to search nucleotide 148 databases employing 6 frame translations to identify new open reading frames 26 , 31 . Automated control of data acquisition and large - scale methods for data interpretation dovetailed beautifully 150 with Hunt’s methods for LC / MSMS analysis of peptides to create a strategy for the analysis of complex peptide mixtures 26 , 32 . This new strategy for data interpretation converted a protein 152 sequence analysis strategy into one of protein identification ( Figure 1 ) . Even though the full Page 5 of 32 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of the American Chemical Society 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 6 complement of proteins in an organism are known after genome is sequencing ( individuals 154 within a species will certainly have sequence variations ) , biochemical experiments still require tools to identify and characterize the proteins involved in specific processes . Protein 156 identification with tandem mass spectrometry facilitated that process and was critical to the creation of “shotgun” proteomics by enabling large - scale , high throughput data analysis - a 158 process that was disruptive to traditional protein analysis methods . A powerful capability of tandem mass spectrometry is that of mixture analysis . 33 When many 160 molecules co - ionize , a tandem mass spectrometer can select individual ions for fragmentation . The development of large - scale data analysis enabled protein mixture analysis because the 162 increased efficiency of the process made it feasible to collect and interpret thousands of tandem mass spectra in a timely fashion . This was first realized by Eng et al and McCormack et al 164 when they showed the intentional digestion of protein mixtures for the purpose of protein identification using LC / MSMS and database searching . 30 , 34 Direct analysis of protein mixtures 166 has obvious advantages over methods which require purification and sequential analysis . It’s highly efficient and sensitive and by limiting sample manipulation , sample losses are minimized . 168 This is particularly important for low abundance proteins where constant exposure to new , active surfaces can result in substantial losses . Furthermore , highly abundant proteins in a 170 mixture can act as carriers to help protect low abundance proteins from active surfaces . Direct , solution based analysis of proteins also provides better opportunities to proteolytically digest 172 proteins and to enrich peptides . The technological developments that allowed direct analysis of digested protein mixtures have revolutionized the analysis of proteins and proved to be a 174 disruptive innovation for 2D gel electrophoresis ( 2DGE ) , the best method for proteomics at the time . 176 This new strategy for protein analysis was quickly used to develop new types of analyses for molecular and cellular biology ( Figure 2 ) . McCormack et al identified proteins involved in 178 protein - protein interactions using three different methods to enrich interacting proteins , with subsequent analysis by direct solution digestion of the proteins and LC / MSMS with database 180 searching . 32 Cells compartmentalize activities into discrete sections or locations . Membrane proteins have long been difficult to isolate because of their hydrophobicity and this new strategy 182 allowed digestion of the more soluble portions of the protein for easier analysis and identification 35 . Identifying the proteins residing in subcellular compartments assists in 184 understanding the various activities that take place there as well as providing information about a protein’s function or role 36 . Link et al used tandem mass spectrometry to identify the contents 186 Page 6 of 32 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of the American Chemical Society 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 7 of the periplasmic space in E . coli . 37 These studies demonstrated for the first time the interplay between molecular and cellular biological techniques and a new strategy to identify proteins 188 using “shotgun protein analysis” , a term coined in 1998 . 38 A number of interesting applications have been performed using shotgun proteomics , including correlation profiling to identify the 190 components of an organelle , subtractive analysis to identify those proteins enriched in the nuclear envelope versus the endoplasmic reticulum and the large - scale identification of protein 192 complexes . 39 , 40 32 , 41 With the establishment of methods to analyze protein complexes and subcellular compartments , 194 the obvious next step was to develop methods for the analysis of intact cells . 35 , 41 Whole cell analysis is a complicated endeavor as cells contain a mixture of different compartments , many 196 proteins are bound in complexes or inserted in lipid bilayers , and protein isoforms and modified forms can increase complexity . So the challenge to developing methods for whole cell analysis 198 is twofold . First , good strategies to digest protein mixtures must be created , and then good methods must be developed to separate the complex peptide mixture . Good separation 200 techniques allow you to obtain high levels of sequence coverage which can reveal data on isoforms and protein modifications or the “proteoforms” of proteins . 202 The digestion of proteins has long been a first step in the analysis of protein sequence or structure . Protein digestion was traditionally performed on a homogenous protein so it was a 204 simple task to ensure the protein was denatured and digested . However , in protein mixtures proteolysis can be limited because of steric or chemical inhibition . When proteins are tightly 206 bound in complexes or to DNA , a protease may be unable to access sites of cleavage . Additionally , membrane proteins may be protected by their folding through the lipid bilayer and 208 by modifications frequently found on membrane proteins , such as glycosylation . Link et al overcame these issues by employing a two - step digestion procedure that employed 210 endoproteinase Lys - C digestion in 8M urea followed by dilution of the solution to 2 M urea and trypsin digestion . 41 The first step in this process uses a higher concentration of chaotrope to 212 better denature the proteins . Because endoproteinase Lys - C is still active at that concentration , it is used to initiate digestion and then a lower concentration of chaotrope is used for a final 214 trypsin digestion . Washburn et al improved on the process and captured more membrane proteins by segregating insoluble from soluble proteins using high salt and sodium carbonate 216 washes and then subjecting the membrane fraction to cyanogen bromide digestion followed by trypsin . 35 This process worked well and led to a very high coverage of the yeast membrane 218 proteome . Blonder et al used a high concentration of alcohol in buffer to perform a trypsin Page 7 of 32 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of the American Chemical Society 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 8 digest on membrane proteins with good success . 42 Wu et al used a non - specific protease to 220 better cleave the exposed regions of membrane proteins . 43 This process had an added advantage of providing information about how proteins were folded through the lipid bilayer , a 222 strategy exploited by Blackler et al to study protein channel function . 44 Liebler et al employed a filter aided digestion process to employ better chaotropes to denature proteins that were not 224 mass spectrometry compatible . 45 Wiśniewski , et al used the same method , initially denaturing proteins in SDS and then swapping the SDS for urea . 46 The initial digestion of proteins in 226 solution is a key starting point in whole proteome analysis and efficient and complete digestion is essential to high proteome coverage . 228 A critical aspect of large - scale proteomics is the ability to separate incredibly complex mixtures of peptides . 47 , 48 The challenges of these separations have invigorated the mature field of liquid 230 chromatographic separations with many new developments in HPLC pumps , chromatographic supports and separation strategies . In particular , HPLC pumps capable of driving very high 232 pressure separations have proven to be important in order to allow the use of much smaller chromatographic supports which improve separation efficiency and increase peak capacity . 49 - 51 234 Jorgenson’s pioneering work in this area has driven the development of new pumps capable of sustaining pressures of 12 - 20K psi . 52 To address the complexity of proteomic samples , there 236 has been a resurgence in multi - dimensional separations with an emphasis on strategies which can be coupled to the mass spectrometer . Recent reviews of LC / LC provide a more in - depth 238 treatment of this topic , but briefly , configurations in use frequently combine ion exchange methods such as Strong Cation Exchange or Strong Anion Exchange with reversed - phase ( RP ) 240 separations or combine RP - RP with separations based on different pH in the RP columns . 47 , 53 Regardless of configuration , RP is frequently the last step before the mass spectrometer so 242 peptides can be desalted prior to ionization in order to avoid formation of salt adducts . An interesting development has been the use of porous layer open tubular columns ( PLOT ) for 244 proteomics . 54 , 55 Long used in gas chromatography to achieve high efficiency separations , PLOT columns are now seeing increased use as mass spectrometers have reached a level of 246 sensitivity that is more compatible with the low capacity of these columns . A goal of proteomic separations is to increase peak capacity and separation efficiency in the shortest time possible , 248 which is a very difficult proposition . If peak widths become too narrow , the mass spectrometer may not be able to scan fast enough to sample peptides , so peaks get missed ; consequently 250 the efficiency of separations has to be matched to the scan speed of the mass spectrometer Page 8 of 32 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of the American Chemical Society 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 9 employed . Good separations are critical to reducing ion suppression and increasing dynamic 252 range , which will also advance protein sequence coverage during an analysis . The Drive to Determine Protein Function . Genome projects provide information about the 254 functional coding elements present in the DNA sequence . From DNA sequences bioinformatic algorithms can postulate the function of such coding elements through sequence similarity . 256 Proteins can have multiple biological functions and simply knowing that a protein sequence is similar to that of known proteins does not provide proof of its activity or when the protein is 258 active . Thus , an important task for proteomics is to determine the functions and roles of all proteins encoded in a genome sequence . Shotgun proteomic technologies have enabled new 260 strategies to rapidly get at this information . The concept of “guilt by association” is a powerful approach to develop initial clues about what 262 proteins might do in biological systems . This is most easily done by enriching protein complexes and identifying the components . If something is known about the function of the 264 “bait” protein , then the function of all proteins interacting with the bait can be inferred . For example , Carney et al identified Nbs1 , a protein involved in double strand DNA repair and 266 responsible for the disease Nijmegen breakage syndrome , by isolating a protein complex containing two other “bait” proteins , Mre11 and Rad50 56 , which were known to be involved in 268 this repair process . This complex forms to repair damaged DNA after X - radiation of cells . Hazbun et al combined the analysis of protein complexes with several other techniques to 270 identify the functions of 100 essential , hypothetical genes in S . cerevisiae . 57 In this study they were able to assign functions to 77 of the 100 proteins . Sato et al and Conaway et al were able 272 to find the long missing components of the mammalian Mediator complex using shotgun proteomics of the complex . 58 , 59 Large - scale protein - protein interaction studies are now common 274 and provide rich insights into the biology of organisms . 60 - 65 A more traditional biochemical strategy to associate a function to a protein is to enrich proteins 276 based on activity and then identify the protein involved . However , protein activity can be lost before a protein is enriched to homogeneity ( or the activity can originate from a collection of 278 proteins ) . Shotgun proteomics can be used to identify the proteins present in the enriched fractions before homogeneity is reached or the activity is lost . Sauerwald et al used this 280 approach to identify O - phosphoseryl - tRNA synthetase as the enzyme involved in the formation of Cys - tRNA Cys in organisms lacking cysteinyl - tRNA synthetase . 66 A more global approach to 282 discover protein activities was developed by Liu et al using an activity based profiling method to Page 9 of 32 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of the American Chemical Society 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 10 identify proteins with a particular enzymatic activity . 67 This approach uses a “suicide substrate” 284 inhibitor or other types of tightly bound active site inhibitors tethered to a solid support to pull out enzymes that are in an active state . Most importantly , new enzymes of a class can be found 286 using this method . A striking result in a search for hydrolases was the identification of many proteins whose sequences would not have classified them as hydrolases , but whose activity 288 very clearly did . 67 Activity - based methods combined with shotgun proteomics create precise methods to identify proteins with specific enzymatic activities . 290 Whole cell or organelle analyses can also provide functional insight into proteins . Proteins that co - localize in organelles such as the mitochondria share a common role and since the vast 292 majority of proteins that localize in the mitochondria are derived from the nuclear genome , their presence in the mitochondria may be reflective of the tissue type and the needs of the tissue . 294 Kislinger et al and Mootha et al identified proteins in the mitochondria from 6 different organs of the mouse and they found the distribution of proteins varied depending on the tissue type . 68 , 69 296 Tissue dependent differences in mitochondrial proteins may reflect the needs of the tissues , as heart tissue may have very different energy needs from brain tissue . The presence of proteins 298 at particular times in a cell or organism’s lifecycle can reveal information about a protein’s role . For example , Florens et al used proteomic methods to measure protein expression in different 300 morphological states of Plasmodium falciparum ( Pf ) , which , when combined with studies in other Plasmodium species , revealed keen insights into stage specific proteins . 70 , 71 Plasmodium 302 undergoes a complicated lifecycle between two species of hosts and is very evasive of the human immune system . 71 , 72 Comparing transcript expression with protein expression for each 304 stage revealed how transcripts are prepared in one stage for translation in the next stage . 73 Expression profiling , although complicated to interpret , can be a useful shotgun strategy to 306 identify proteins with important functions , particularly when combined with genetic perturbations . 74 308 Qualitative proteomic analysis has focused primarily on acquiring more information about a sample , such as cell tissue or protein complex , with the ultimate goal of comprehensive 310 coverage of all proteins present . What technological advances are needed to achieve this goal ? Sample preparation methods to ensure all proteins are properly digested and soluble have 312 made good progress . Sequence coverage has been increased by using multi - protease digestions to ensure peptides are within the acquisition range of the mass spectrometer . 75 - 77 In 314 addition , new peptide dissociation methods such as electron transfer dissociation ( ETD ) have increased the size of peptides that can be efficiently fragmented . 78 High sequence coverage 316 Page 10 of 32 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of the American Chemical Society 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 11 increases the chance of observing modified peptides and peptides that may represent a splice junction which helps to differentiate protein isoforms . Two major challenges exist for complex 318 mixtures such as a cell or tissue lysate : ion suppression and dynamic range . Ion suppression occurs whenever a complex mixture is ionized , as some molecules ionize preferentially , 320 suppressing the ionization of others . This issue has been summarized by Cech and Enke . 79 Anderson observed this problem in an attempt to perform targeted mass spectrometry of 322 peptides in digested serum , where he found big increases in signal and success by pre - enriching the peptides with antibodies prior to analysis . 80 Eliminating the bulk of the matrix 324 background reduced ion suppression and improved signals for the target peptides . Wolters et al observed a similar effect and improved analyses by using LC / LC to increase fractionation of 326 the complex peptide mixtures to reduce the complexity during ionization . 81 If methods can be developed to better reduce or eliminate ion suppression , more uniform ionization could be 328 created for peptides , which will improve both qualitative and quantitative analysis . The challenge of measuring the large dynamic range of peptide and protein abundances is linked to 330 ion suppression , but is primarily associated with limits of detection in the mass spectrometer . Both ion suppression and dynamic range can be partially overcome by increasing fractionation 332 of peptides , but this increases time of analysis and limits its usefulness as an experimental strategy ( e . g . long analysis times ) . Fonslow et al recently described two strategies to selectively 334 remove more abundant proteins from complex protein mixtures . 82 , 83 One method uses differential affinity for a hexapeptide library to remove more abundant proteins and another 336 harnesses Michelis - Menton enzyme kinetics to preferentially digest abundant proteins in complex mixtures . In addition to ion suppression and dynamic range , a third issue is one of MS 338 peak capacity . Typically , precursor ions are selected with a 3 amu wide window which increases the chance of precursor ion “contamination” with other precursors and results in poor search 340 results . A workaround is to purposely try to multiplex MSMS and then deconvolute spectra for searching . 84 , 85 This strategy is called Data Independent Acquisition ( DIA ) . It has been proposed 342 by several groups and is commercially available ( MS e ) . 84 - 88 As mass spectrometers scan faster it becomes more feasible to use DIA for identification and to improve quantitation . 85 , 86 Tandem 344 mass spectrometers have improved significantly with each generation , moving shotgun proteomics closer to achieving a complete proteome . Determining when a complete proteome 346 is achieved , however , is a difficult proposition as proteomes are dynamic and it’s not clear exactly how many proteins should be present . In addition , it is critical that a complete proteome 348 be achieved with a reasonable experimental strategy and not through a time - consuming brute - force strategy ( e . g . extensive fractionation ) . 350 Page 11 of 32 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of the American Chemical Society 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 12 Control and regulation of Biological Systems . Proteins are modified by a dazzling array of molecular structures . Many are simply structural modifications that alter the chemical 352 characteristics of the protein , such as lipid or carbohydrate modifications that seem to have no obvious regulatory function , but other modifications are keenly involved in regulation . A feature 354 that distinguishes regulatory from non - regulatory modifications is often reversibility , with regulatory modifications typically being reversible and non - regulatory modifications typically 356 being non - reversible . One exception is proteolytic processing which can convert enzymes from an inactive state to an active state and is irreversible . 358 Mass spectrometry has been used for the analysis of protein modifications for a long time . The measurement of mass in highly regular molecules such as proteins is a straightforward way to 360 identify the addition of unexpected molecular structures . Early examples include Gerber et al , who discovered a pyroglutamic acid on the N - terminus of bacteriorhodopsin 89 and Carr et al , 362 who developed an elegant method to identify the presence of the labile modification gamma - carboxyglutamic acid . 90 The development of ionization methods such as FAB improved the 364 direct observation and analysis of post translational modifications such as pyroglutamic acid and C - terminal amides 91 . Mass spectrometry analysis of protein phosphorylation sites was 366 developed using FAB - MS and was extended to the analysis of sulfation , which occurs on tyrosine and can be easily confused for tyrosine phosphorylation . 92 , 93 Tandem mass 368 spectrometry is more effective than FAB - MS for identifying sites of modification , and was implemented by Hunt et al , who used it to identify phosphopeptides which had been enriched by 370 iron ( III ) affinity chromatography . 94 , 95 In these pre - genome sequence era strategies , the protein sequence was known and the protein was purified to homogeneity before attempting to identify 372 the sites of modification . As genome sequences began to appear and protein identification methods were developed , the 374 nature of the problem to identify modifications changed . Yates et al demonstrated the use of database searching methods to identify post translational modifications using tandem mass 376 spectrometry data . 26 The challenge of identifying the site of modification confidently is greater than simply identifying the amino acid sequence of the peptide , as there can be multiple sites of 378 modification within a peptide with different types of modifications at each site . A search algorithm must assess all the possibilities and determine which amino acid is most likely 380 modified . A good example of challenges associated with identifying modifications is provided by phosphorylation . Phosphorylation can occur on Ser , Thr and Tyr , to a lesser extent His and a 382 few other amino acids . Even just considering the major sites of phosphorylation , if multiples of Page 12 of 32 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of the American Chemical Society 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 13 Ser , Thr or Tyr appear in a sequence , each one is a potential site of modification and thus 384 increases the possibilities to be considered by a search algorithm . For example , if there are 3 sites within a sequence , then there are 2 3 possible ways the peptide can be modified by 386 phosphorylation . The molecular weight of the measured peptide can rule out whether the peptide has 1 , 2 , or 3 phosphorylations , but determining the sites when the peptide is not fully 388 modified requires having specific fragment ions that define the mass shifts associated with a modification site . An additional issue is that a peptide can be modified at different sites , giving 390 the modified peptides the same molecular weight and often the same HPLC elution time causing co - elution and co - fragmentation in the mass spectrometer . When the tandem mass 392 spectrometer collects a spectrum that represents two or more modified peptides , evidence for both possibilities exists in the tandem mass spectrum . If they are equimolar , then evidence will 394 likely be strong for both possibilities , but if they are not equimolar , then evidence will be stronger for one possibility rather than the other . Most search programs will simply assign the match to 396 the strongest match , but on visual inspection of the spectrum , “contamination” may be observed . No algorithms have appeared that can quantitate the amount of each modified site 398 within a spectrum , although algorithms exist to determine the probability that the dominant site is correctly identified . 96 Search algorithms have also appeared to search for modifications in a 400 blind manner without regard to the type of modification . 97 The ability to rapidly interpret modified tandem mass spectra and assign sites of modification created the ability to perform these 402 analyses on a large - scale and has led to a better understanding of the biology of modifications . The large - scale acquisition of peptide data by tandem mass spectrometry , together with high 404 throughput data analysis enabled Ficaro et al to combine a phosphopeptide enrichment strategy for a large - scale analysis of phosphopeptides in S . cerevisiae . 98 Phosphorylation can be difficult 406 to observe because it often occurs in hydrophilic regions of proteins , exists at substoichiometric levels , and modifies lower abundance proteins , so Ficarro et al incorporated the use of 408 phosphopeptide enrichment into their analysis to improve detection of phosphopeptides . 98 Iron ( III ) affinity chromatography , first used in conjunction with mass spectrometry by Michel et al , 410 had been widely employed to enrich phosphopeptides from single proteins , but Ficarro et al was the first to use it in a large - scale “shotgun” format . 94 , 98 This work triggered a “space race” to 412 collect as many phosphopeptide sites as possible from different cell types and tissues . Beauloslil et al identified over 5000 phosphopeptides in HeLa cells and the numbers from other 414 studies continue to grow . 99 - 102 While existing studies have done a tremendous job of cataloging protein phosphorylation sites , the next step is establishing the context of phosphorylation at 416 Page 13 of 32 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of the American Chemical Society 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 14 sites that may be regulating processes or function . Such studies are more exacting and not nearly as high throughput . Kunz et al and Kubota et al have developed a method , “KAYAK” , to 418 study the regulatory roles of specific kinase phosphorylation sites . 103 , 104 Large - scale analysis of modification sites has expanded to include any modification that can be enriched , which has 420 also fueled the development of new enrichment methods . 105 - 107 These methods and studies will help bring into focus the role of modifications in controlling and regulating biological processes . 422 Protein Quantitation . The idea of quantitating molecules using mass spectrometry dates back to the origins of mass analysis when Aston discovered the existence of stable isotopes . 108 With 424 Nier’s enrichment of the 13 C stable isotope , the ability to trace molecules specifically labeled with stable isotopes based on mass differences in the mass spectrometer became possible . 109 426 In early mass spectrometry peptide sequencing strategies , stable isotope - labeled reagents were also used to shift fragment ion series or to differentiate amino acids whose masses become 428 isobaric ( equal molecular weight ) during derivatization chemistry 8 . Furthermore , stable isotope labeling was a sine qua non of quantitative mass spectrometry for in vivo studies of metabolism 430 such as determining amino acid essentiality . Early quantitative studies in proteomics involved the use of 2 - D Gel Electrophoresis ( 2 - DGE ) 432 with measurement of changes based on protein coloration through a protein staining method or radioactivity . The density of the stain reflected the amount of protein present , but care had to be 434 taken to stain proteins in precisely the same manner , as development time could alter the density of staining . The advent of mass spectrometry based protein identification techniques 436 allowed the identity of proteins on 2 - DGE to be readily determined , providing a huge boon to the use of 2 - DGE for biological studies . Mass Spectrometry protein identification methods reduced 438 the time and labor needed to determine what protein was in a spot and allowed identification to be combined with quantitation . 440 To create more accurate methods of quantitation , stable isotope labeling methods were combined with mass spectrometry for the analysis of intact proteins ( Figure 3 ) . Several 442 approaches have emerged which employ stable isotope metabolic labeling methods or covalent tagging with reagents containing labels . In 1998 Langen et al presented a method employing 444 15 N and 13 C labeled amino acids to metabolically label proteins for quantitation . 110 In 1999 three papers were published on the use of stable isotope labeling to measure expression changes . 111 - 446 113 Oda et al used 15 N stable isotope metabolic labeling in S . cerevisiae to identify expression changes and to quantitate a phosphorylated peptide . 112 Pasa - Tolic et al used isotope depleted 448 Page 14 of 32 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of the American Chemical Society 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 15 media ( 13 C , 15 N , 2 H ) to create differences from normal media to measure changes in intact proteins of E . coli . 113 Patents were filed by Chait et al and Franza and Rochon in 1999 to cover 450 various aspects of metabolic labeling for protein quantitation including the use stable isotope labeled amino acids such as heavy Lys and Arg . 114 , 115 In 1999 a different approach was also 452 published by Gygi et al as they described the use of a stable isotope labeled reagent to modify Cys residues and introduce a mass differential tag . 111 The reagent also allowed affinity isolation 454 of the labeled peptide . The concept and design of the tag was based on the reagent developed by Gerber et al to measure changes in metabolites in urine . 116 While the ICAT method was 456 elegant in concept , it had a number of drawbacks including that identification and quantification were often based on one peptide per protein , which limits statistical analysis . There was also 458 difficulty with peptide recovery from the avidin based system used for enrichment . Munchbach et al created an N - terminal labeling method that introduced a stable isotope label and helped 460 direct fragmentation during CID , presaging the isobaric tagging methods to be introduced a few years later . 117 Conrads et al used 15 N labeling together with a Cys affinity capture system to 462 create a method similar to ICAT . 118 Zhang et al explored the use of deuterium labeled derivatizing agents , eventually culminating in an isotope coding strategy . 119 Washburn et al 464 used shotgun proteomics together with 15 N labeling to measure protein expression changes on a large - scale . 120 Rather than attempt to enrich for peptides or to separate by gel 466 electrophoresis , the Washburn et al approach used a large - scale separation method for shotgun proteomics of labeled peptides . Shu et al and Ong et al used the addition of stable isotope 468 labeled amino acids to media as a way to label proteins that were then separated by gel electrophoresis . 121 , 122 Following in the work of Munchbach et al , two methods to label the N - 470 terminus of peptides were developed by Thompson et al and Ross et al that had an unusual twist . 123 , 124 Both methods had a set of labels that were isobaric until peptides were fragmented 472 and then they revealed a unique mass tag . This method allows experiments to be multiplexed and , surprisingly , produces fairly good measurement accuracy . Dephoure and Gygi recently 474 demonstrated hyperplexing with 18 channels using isobaric tags and stable isotope labeling . 125 In vivo Labeling Whole Animals . The introduction of stable isotope labels in humans and 476 animals was used to measure metabolic fates of molecules . 126 Metabolic analyses were then performed with trace levels of stable isotope labeled amino acid and very specific and sensitive 478 mass spectrometers such as isotope ratio mass spectrometers ( IRMS ) . Animal labeling with heavy isotopes was studied for safety and was thought to be safe for use at tracer levels , but 480 the high levels necessary for proteomics were never studied . For this reason a study by Page 15 of 32 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of the American Chemical Society 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 16 Krijgsveld et al that labeled C . elegans and D . melanogaster with 15 N was received with much 482 enthusiasm . 127 These metazoans , while not as complex as mammals , are still multicellular model systems used for the study of complex biology and thus would be useful for proteomic 484 studies . Wu et al developed methods to label rats with 15 N to very high levels of atomic percent enrichment using a method similar to Krijgsveld et al and ( Figure 4 ) 128 these rats were used to 486 study brain development . 129 - 131 A similar method to label mice with only stable isotope labeled lysine added to the diet was published by Kruger et al . but this method required labeling several 488 generations of animals to achieve sufficient enrichment for proteomic studies . 132 Metabolic stable isotope labeling has been shown to be a very powerful method to study animal biology . 490 Recently , Savas et al showed that the nuclear pore complex ( NPC ) is extremely long lived in post mitotic cells of tissues like the brain . 133 By labeling an animal with 15 N to 95 % enrichment 492 and then shifting the animals back to an 14 N diet the proteins that are long lived can be identified at various time points in the animal’s life . At 1 year , some of the proteins of the neuronal NPC 494 are still labeled with 15 N demonstrating turnover of proteins in the complex is very slow . Whole animal labeling enables questions that involve more complicated systems than cell lines and 496 may better reflect organismic biology . For example , McClatchy et al measured protein expression changes in mitochondria and synaptosomes in rat brains as a function of 498 developmental time points and location in the brain . 134 New proteins were clearly observed that followed expression programs similar to proteins involved in specific developmentally based 500 diseases . McClatchy also measured phosphorylation differences in rat livers and brain by mixing heavy labeled liver into light labeled brain in a strategy that allows a direct view of how 502 tissues might be different . 135 Similarly , Gygi et al measured phosphorylation analysis of mouse tissues using label free quantitation methods . This study demonstrated the ability to compare 504 phosphorylation of proteins and peptides across different types of tissues . 102 Ishihama et al used a stable isotope labeled cell line as an internal standard to spike into tissues and 506 quantitate protein expression changes . 136 Liao et al showed the reverse also works , where stable isotope labeled brain tissue can be spiked into primary neuronal cells to quantitate 508 protein expression . 137 By using a ratio of ratio approach to quantitate , the internal standard is spiked into the experimental system as well as the control and this controls for systematic errors 510 and does not require the internal standard to be exactly the same as either system . 138 Stable isotope labeling of animals allows the use of tissues and organs for the study of diseases . Of 512 additional interest is that tissues and organs are collections of many different cell types and thus are systems of systems which in the end will require studies to understand how these 514 communities of cells function .

Large - scale methods to identify proteins have naturally 516 led to strategies that also try to simultaneously measure the amount of protein present using the methods described above . Being able to both identify and quantify proteins allows the 518 determination of changes in biological systems with perturbations or stimulations . In shotgun proteomics , this creates a paradox . To identify proteins in complex systems in a comprehensive 520 manner requires fast scanning instruments and highly efficient chromatography to maximize peak capacity for MSMS . The instrument should rapidly collect data for a peptide and then 522 move on to a new peptide . Peptide quantitation requires the collection of sufficient data points to make an accurate measurement of the differences between two states . The competing 524 demands , brevity in measurement versus persistence in measurement , leads to trade - offs in the quality of data used for quantitation since limits of detection for peptide identification most often 526 exceeds the limit of quantitation . A solution to this problem is to optimize measurements for identification and quantify well enough to observe the trends in changes which can then be 528 measured more accurately and precisely with more focused mass spectrometry methods . This strategy was used by Dong et al to measure genetically perturbed changes in the insulin 530 signaling pathway in C . elegans . 74 Another issue is the measurement of “presence or absence” in quantitation experiments . Most software tools require both the heavy and light isotopically 532 labeled peptides be present for a measurement to be calculated . When the ratio of peptides exceeds 10 to 1 , quantitation efficiency begins to drop - off and large changes can be missed . 139 534 Some label - free methods such as spectral counting are better able to determine large changes , but these methods tend to be less accurate than labeling methods . 140 , 141 Better methods are 536 needed to observe large changes in abundance which can be very important in biological systems . 538 Future Prospects . George postulated that the unexpectedly low number of genes in humans is necessitated by the need to have a useful immune system . 142 If the sequence space of humans 540 were too large , pathogens could readily evade the immune system . Functional diversity must then result from small changes in proteins rather than from completely new sequences . 542 Alternate splicing and covalent modification create this functional diversity . To fully understand human biology , we must begin to understand the functional roles of protein isoforms and 544 modifications and thus we need technology to readily separate and measure protein isoforms and modifications in a functional context . As we’ve learned with histones and their complex sets 546 of modifications , patterns of a modification or patterns of different types of modifications together may create a higher order of regulation . 143 548 Page 17 of 32 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of the American Chemical Society 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 18 To fill this need , robust methods to measure molecular weight and determine sequence for intact proteins would be ideal . Technology for “top down” mass spectrometry is still developing 550 and will require significant innovation to reduce the cost and complexity of mass spectrometers to democratize its use . 144 - 147 In the intermediate term , MS analyzers to sequence and 552 characterize longer polypeptides in the range of 5 - 10 , 000 Da have improved dramatically in the last few years , but proteases or chemical cleavage methods to cleave proteins in to 5 - 10K 554 pieces are needed . Most proteases produce smaller peptides , although Wu et al recently reported a bacterial protease , OmpT , that is a rare cutter protease producing on average 556 polypeptides 6 . 3 kDa or greater . 147 Higher resolution mass spectrometers coupled with ETD should permit ready characterization of these medium sized polypeptides . 146 558 Protein complexes represent a higher order structure within cells ( Figure 5 ) . Determining how protein isoforms or modified forms ( now referred to as “proteoforms” ) affect the function or 560 activity of complexes is a next step . When protein complexes are studied they are often enriched through a single “bait” protein that may exist in many different complexes . 562 Consequently when analyzed all the components of the multiple complexes are identified without knowing to what specific complex they belong . By isolating the different complexes 564 consisting of this bait and then identifying all the proteins and proteoforms present , the functions of the individual complexes can be better dissected . Furthermore , the composition of 566 complexes is dynamic and thus higher throughput strategies for global analyses of complexes , as well as methods to dissect out the composition of individual complexes with cellular changes 568 are needed . 148 , 149 Determining proteoform information in the context of individual protein complexes will help sort out the functional roles of proteoforms and the individual protein 570 complexes . It is expected that mass spectrometers will continue to evolve at a fast pace through 572 technological advances and fierce commercial competition . Instruments will scan faster with better sensitivity to create better tools for proteomics and further increase capabilities for 574 biological discovery . Mass spectrometry will continue to drive the discovery of new and important biology . 576 Acknowledgements .

Protein sequencing becomes protein identification . In both strategies the intact protein is digested with a protease , typically trypsin which cleaves after arginine or lysine , to 582 produce a collection of peptides . By using liquid separations coupled to a tandem mass spectrometer , peptide ions are fragmented as they elute into the instrument . In protein 584 sequencing the tandem mass spectrum is interpreted to determine the amino acid sequence de novo . In protein identification , the tandem mass spectrum is searched through a collection of 586 protein sequences to find the best amino acid sequence match to the spectrum . Figure 2 . Shotgun proteomics can be used to directly identify the components of cells , 588 organelles , protein complexes and proteins . Shotgun proteomics also simplifies the analysis of membrane proteins since the proteins can be digested directly in a lipid bilayer rather than trying 590 to enrich the proteins . Membrane proteins are hydrophobic and difficult to manipulate in aqueous buffers . 592 Figure 3 . Quantitation of proteins can be performed using stable isotope labels , covalent tags , or label free methods . A ) In stable isotope labeling ( SIL ) methods , a heavy stable isotope label 594 allows peptide masses to be distinguished in the mass spectrometer between different experimental states . Abundance differences can be visualized by selected ion chromatograms . 596 B ) Isobaric tags add a mass to the peptides of each state that is isobaric until the peptide ions are fragmented which then reveals a mass difference . The difference in abundance is 598 quantified from the reporter ions in the tandem mass spectrum . C ) Two different experimental states can be compared using “label - free” methods . Ion intensity can be measured and 600 compared by selected ion chromatograms as with SIL methods , but these measurements are taken from two different analyses . Another method uses “spectral counting” as a surrogate for 602 abundance based on the observation that proteins which are more abundant have more peptide ions acquired . Label free methods are typically not as accurate as other methods , but can often 604 provide sufficient information to prioritize follow up experiments . Figure 4 . Mice and rats can be labeled with heavy stable isotopes by controlling the protein 606 source in their food . By adding protein labeled with heavy and light stable isotopes to protein free chow , the source of protein in the diet of the animals is restricted to the heavy or light 608 isotopes . These amino acids are incorporated into the new proteins metabolically synthesized by the cells of the animal . 610 Page 19 of 32 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Journal of the American Chemical Society 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 20 Figure 5 . A future challenge to proteomics is deciphering the structures of protein complexes where different proteins , be they isoforms or modified forms may associate at different times or 612 in different locations within a cell with a specific “core” protein . The core protein is depicted as the “target protein” of the enrichment process . To fully characterize the complexes associating 614 with a specific target protein will require methods to separate or enrich the individual complexes , methods such as top down or native mass spectrometry of the complexes or components of the 616 complexes . This data can identify modification status or protein isoforms ( proteoforms ) present in the complexes . Bottom - up mass spectrometry can accurately identify the proteins present in 618 the complex and modification sites .
