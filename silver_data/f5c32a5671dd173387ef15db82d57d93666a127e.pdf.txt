Preissner 1 Departments of 1 Biochemistry and 2 Internal Medicine , University of Giessen Lung Center , Giessen , Germany Cell surface – associated proteolysis plays a crucial role in the migration of mono - nuclear phagocytes to sites of inﬂamma - tion . The glycolytic enzyme enolase - 1 ( ENO - 1 ) binds plasminogen at the cell surface , enhancing local plasmin produc - tion . This study addressed the role played by ENO - 1 in lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) – driven chemokine - directed monocyte mi - gration and matrix invasion in vitro , as well as recruitment of monocytes to the alveolar compartment in vivo . LPS rapidly up - regulated ENO - 1 cell - surface expres - sion on human blood monocytes and U937 cells due to protein translocation from cytosolic pools , which increased plasmin generation , enhanced monocyte migration through epithelial monolayers , and promoted matrix degradation . These effects were abrogated by antibodies di - rected against the plasminogen binding site of ENO - 1 . Overexpression of ENO - 1 in U937 cells increased their migratory and matrix - penetrating capacity , which was suppressed by overexpression of a truncated ENO - 1 variant lacking the plas - minogen binding site ( ENO - 1 (cid:1) PLG ) . In vivo , intratracheal LPS application in mice promoted alveolar recruitment of mono - cytic cells that overexpressed ENO - 1 , but not of cells overexpressing ENO - 1 (cid:1) PLG . Consistent with these data , pneumonia - patients exhibited increased ENO - 1 cell - surface expression on blood monocytes and intense ENO - 1 staining of mono - nuclear cells in the alveolar space . These data suggest an important mechanism of inﬂammatory cell invasion mediated by increased cell - surface expression of ENO - 1 . ( Blood . 2009 ; 113 : 5588 - 5598 ) Introduction Monocytes are circulating mononuclear phagocytes with a broad spectrum of activities and functions . In pathologic conditions associated with acute or chronic inﬂammation , monocytes migrate into the affected tissues and differentiate into tissue macro - phages . 1 , 2 Thus , monocytes and tissue macrophages are critical cellular components of the host defense system against infectious diseases , including forms of pneumonia , and have important functions in both native and acquired immunity . They are respon - sible for the phagocytosis and clearance of invading microorgan - isms , regulate antimicrobial programs of gene expression , are a potent source of inﬂammatory cytokines , and interact with T cells through cell - cell or cytokine - mediated mechanisms , thereby facili - tating acquired immunity to speciﬁc pathogens . 1 - 7 In atherosclero - sis , monocytes inﬁltrate atherosclerotic plaques , accumulate lipid - rich material , and differentiate into macrophage - type foam cells . 8 Moreover , tumor - inﬁltrating monocytes may play a role in tumor progression and metastasis by different mechanisms , including regulation of angiogenesis . 9 Many of these activities depend upon the ability of monocytes to localize and regulate cell surface – associated proteolytic activity . The enzymes of the ﬁbrinolytic system represent one of the most broadly distributed cell surface – associated protease sys - tems . The accumulation of plasminogen ( PLG ) and its activa - tors , namely urokinase ( u - PA ) and tissue - plasminogen activator ( t - PA ) , at the cell surface augments u - PA and t - PA catalytic efﬁciency , and protects these enzymes from inactivation by inhibitors . 10 - 12 Plasmin , which is generated from PLG by limited proteolysis , plays a key role in the degradation of a provisional matrix composed of ﬁbrin and other extracellular matrix compo - nents . These pericellular proteolytic activities facilitate cell migration and invasion . 13 - 15 Cell - surface receptors for PLG and its activators provide a mechanism for cells to harness and regulate the activities of these proteases . 16 Binding sites for PLG , t - PA , and u - PA have been identiﬁed on a variety of cell types , including monocytes , lymphocytes , granulocytes , ﬁbro - blasts , and endothelial cells . 12 , 17 These sites include enolase - 1 ( ENO - 1 ) , 18 , 19 annexin II , 20 , 21 p11 , 22 histone H2B ( H2B ) , 23 and gangliosides . 24 ENO - 1 is a key glycolytic enzyme that acts as a 2 - phospho - D - glycerate hydrolase in the cytoplasm of prokary - otic and eukaryotic cells . On the cell surface , interaction of PLG with ENO - 1 enhances its activation by t - PA and protects PLG from inhibition by (cid:1) 2 - plasmin inhibitor ( (cid:1) 2 PI ) . The PLG – ENO - 1 interaction is mediated by binding of PLG kringle domains to the C - terminal lysine residues of ENO - 1 . 18 , 19 As a consequence , PLG binding to ENO - 1 is inhibited by lysine analogs , such as (cid:2) - aminocaproic acid or tranexamic acid ( TXA ) . Moreover , treatment of cells with carboxypeptidase B strongly reduces cell surface – dependent binding and activation of PLG . 18 , 25 Many pathogens ( including group A Streptococci , Streptococ - cus pneumoniae ) use extracellular ENO - 1 to capture plasmin ( o - gen ) , potentially allowing bacteria to acquire surface - associated Submitted August 6 , 2008 ; accepted January 17 , 2009 .

Therefore , in the present study we asked whether ENO - 1 cell - surface expression on human blood monocytes and the U937 monocytic cell line can be modulated by inﬂammatory stimuli , and whether ENO - 1 – dependent plasmin generation may contribute to monocyte migration and recruitment to the inﬂamed lung . Methods A detailed description of routine methodologies is provided in Document S1 ( available on the Blood website ; see the Supplemental Materials link at the top of the online article ) . Only nonstandard procedures and specialized materials are described here . Patient samples Investigations were approved by the local institutional review board at the University of Giessen Lung Center . Informed consent was obtained from the patients or their next - of - kin in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki . Diagnosis of pneumonia was settled on the basis of typical clinical symptoms ( eg , fever , tachycardia , dyspnea , tachypnea , cough ) and ausculta - tory ﬁndings ( including rales and egophony ) , the presence of new lung inﬁltrates on chest X - rays , and microbiologic identiﬁcation of pathogens in the lower respiratory tract by bronchoscopy . Human peripheral blood monocytes ( PBMos ) were isolated from pneumonia patients and healthy volunteers by density - gradient separation . 29 Cell purity was greater than 95 % ( determined by ﬂow cytometry ) , and cell viability was greater than 95 % ( determined by trypan blue exclusion ) . Lung specimens were obtained by autopsy from 5 pneumonia patients and 5 control patients ( 4 patients who died of myocardial infarction and 1 patient who died from drug intoxication ) . In the case of control patients , pathologic conditions of the lung were ruled out by histologic examination of lung tissue sections . Cell - associated ﬁbrinolytic activity The U937 cells or PBMos ( 1 . 5 (cid:3) 10 6 / mL ) in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) were preincubated with 15 (cid:4) M Lys - PLG ( Chromogenix , Mo¨lndal , Sweden ) for 1 hour at 37°C and washed with PBS . Plasmin generation was measured at 405 nm as a function of time after addition of 3 nM t - PA ( American Diagnostica , Pfungstadt , Germany ) and 0 . 5 mM chromogenic substrate S - 2251 ( Chromogenix ) in 200 (cid:4) L , using an EL 808 microtiter plate reader ( BioTek Instruments , Highland Park , VT ) . In some experi - ments , the U937 cells or PBMos were incubated with 15 (cid:4) M Lys - PLG in the presence of 10 (cid:4) g / mL of a mouse monoclonal anti – ENO - 1 neutralizing antibody ( from Dr M . Ranson , Department of Biological Sciences , Institute for Molecular Recognition , University ofWollongong , Wollongong , Austra - lia ) , 10 (cid:4) g / mL IgG control ( BD Biosciences , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) , 10 mM tranexamic acid ( TXA ; Sigma - Aldrich , Taufkirchen , Germany ) , or 30 (cid:4) M (cid:1) 2 - PI ( American Diagnostica ) . Migration , transmigration , and matrix invasion assays The U937 cells or PBMos ( 10 5 ) were preincubated with 15 (cid:4) M Lys - PLG for 1 hour at 37°C . Afterward , 3 nM t - PAwas added , and cell aliquots were applied to microwell inserts with a 5 - (cid:4) m pore size membrane ( Greiner Bio - One , Frickenhausen , Germany ) that were either uncoated ( migration assay ) , coated with a monolayer of A549 cells ( transmigration assay ) , or coated with Matrigel ( BD Biosciences ; matrix invasion assay ) as previously described . 21 The integrity ofA549 cell monolayers was assessed microscopi - cally . The inserts were placed into the wells containing serum - free RPMI , with or without 50 ng / mL MCP - 1 ( R & D Systems , Wiesbaden , Germany ) and incubated for 12 hours ( migration and transmigration assays ) or for 18 hours ( matrix invasion assay ) at 37°C . The cells that migrated into the lower well were counted using CasyCounter TT ( Schaerfe Systems , Reutlingen , Germany ) . In some experiments , U937 cells were stimulated with 5 (cid:4) g / mL LPS for 6 hours and then preincubated with 15 (cid:4) M Lys - PLG for 1 hour in the absence or presence of 10 (cid:4) g / mLanti – ENO - 1 neutralizing antibody ( provided by Dr M . Ranson ) , 10 (cid:4) g / mL IgG control , or 10 mM TXA . To assess the number of cells adherent on transwell ﬁlters , the upper side of the ﬁlters was stained with 0 . 2 % crystal violet ( Sigma - Aldrich ) in 2 % ethanol . Excess stain was washed away . Membranes were inspected by light microscopy , where cell density on the membrane surface was reﬂected by blue - colored foci . Animal experiments Animal experiments were performed in accordance with national guidelines and were approved by the local institutional review board at University of Giessen Lung Center . Six - week - old BALB / c mice were used ( n (cid:5) 10 for each group ) . Escherichia coli LPS ( 0 . 5 mg / kg body weight [ b . w . ] ; Sigma - Aldrich ) was administered as an aerosol via microsprayer , as recently described . 30 After 24 hours , mice received intravenous injections of ﬂuores - cently labeled mock - transfected as well as wild - type ( WT ) ENO - 1 ( ENO - 1WT ) – or ENO - 1 (cid:6) PLG – overexpressing U937 cells ( 5 (cid:3) 10 6 in a total volume of 100 (cid:4) L PBS ) . The cells were ﬂuorescently labeled using PKH26 - PCL ( Sigma - Aldrich ) as described previously . 31 After 5 hours , mice were killed with a lethal dose of ketamine and xylazine . The lungs were either subjected to bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) or were prepared , together with spleens , for histologic examination , as recently described in detail . 30 Lung cryosections ( 5 (cid:4) m ) were stained with hematoxylin - eosin and evaluated for evidence of cellular inﬁltrates . To examine the recruit - ment of PKH26 - PCL - positive cells to the lung or spleen , 5 - (cid:4) m cryosec - tions were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes and then either mounted with Vectashield mounting medium ( Vector Laboratories , Burlingame , CA ) or blocked with 3 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) – PBS for 1 hour at 4°C . To asses PLG binding to the cell surface of PKH26 - PCL – positive cells , the lung cryosections were incubated with an anti - PLG antibody ( 1 : 200 ; Abcam ) overnight at 4°C . For identiﬁcation of endothelial and alveolar epithelial cells , overnight incubation at 4°C was performed with an anti – von Willebrand factor ( VWF ; 1 : 100 ; Dako ) or an anti – pro - surfactant protein C antibody ( pro - SP - C ; 1 : 400 ; Millipore , Billerica , MA ) , respectively . Slides were incubated with ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) – conjugated secondary antibody and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium . Nuclei were visualized by DAPI ( 4 , 6 diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ) staining . The images were captured by a Leica DMR microscope with 20 (cid:3) , 40 (cid:3) / 1 . 25 - 0 . 75 oil objective or 63 (cid:3) / 1 . 32 - 0 . 6 oil objective at room temperature and photographed using MetaMorph 7 . 0 ( Molecular Devices , Downingtown , PA ) . The images were processed with Adobe Photoshop 9 . 0 ( Adobe Systems , San Jose , CA ) . Where necessary , ﬂuorescence images were quantiﬁed by comparing the number of red - stained cells with the number of blue - stained cells in a given ﬁeld . All images illustrated are representative of at least 6 other areas per section , seen on at least 3 independent sections . To examine localization of ENO - 1 and PLG on the cell surface of U937 cells , in some experiments LPS - treated mice received unlabeled ENO - 1WT overexpressing cells . The cells were recovered from BAL ﬂuid by ﬂuorescence - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) 5 hours after application and were stained for ENO - 1 and PLG . Statistics All data are given as mean plus or minus SD . Statistical signiﬁcance was assessed using one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) followed by Tukey – honestly signiﬁcant differences ( HSD ) post hoc test , and paired samples were analyzed using the paired 2 - tailed Student t test . A level of P less than . 05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant .

The PBMo population , identiﬁed as CD45 (cid:7) / CD14 (cid:7) cells , uniformly expressed ENO - 1 on the cell surface ( Figure 1A ) . The LPS stimulation of PBMos resulted in increased cell - surface localization of ENO - 1 ( Figure 1A ) , but did not alter the total expression of ENO - 1 mRNA or protein ( Figure 1B , C ) . To assess whether increased surface density of ENO - 1 might be due to protein translocation from cytosolic pools upon stimulation , cellular proteins from PBMos were separated into cytosolic and membrane fractions , and ENO - 1 levels were assessed by Western blot . Under basal conditions , ENO - 1 was detected predomi - nantly in the cytosolic fraction , however , after LPS stimulation , ENO - 1 was primarily associated with the membrane fraction . Translocation of ENO - 1 occurred rapidly ( within 1 hour after LPS exposure ; not shown ) and was most pronounced at 6 hours ( Figure 1D ) . Pronounced cell - surface expression of ENO - 1 in response to LPS stimulation could also be observed by immunoﬂuorescence ( Figure 1E ) . LPS induced the translocation of ENO - 1 to the cell surface of U937 cells Similar to PBMos , U937 cells expressed cell - surface ENO - 1 , and cell - surface expression was increased after LPS stimulation ( Figure 2A , B ) . Western blot analysis of cell membrane and cytosolic fractions from U937 cells revealed maximal ENO - 1 translocation to the cell membrane after 6 hours of stimulation ( Figure 2C ) , while the total mRNA or protein expression of ENO - 1 remained unaltered ( Figure 2D , E ) . It was previously noted that plasminogen binding is elevated at the cell surface of apoptotic or necrotic cells . 32 To exclude the possibility that the observed increase in ENO - 1 cell - surface expression was due to apoptosis or necrosis , these 2 parameters were assessed in U937 cells and in PBMos after LPS challenge . No appreciable increase in the number of apoptotic U937 cells and PBMos was observed after a 6 - hour LPS stimulation when the strongest Figure 1 .

No appreciable changes in the population of necrotic cells were observed after this 6 - hour LPS stimulation either ( data not shown ) . After 24 - hour LPS stimulation , a small increase in apoptosis was observed in U937 cells ( Figure S1 ) . However , in all subsequent experiments , cells were stimulated with LPS for 6 hours . Increased ENO - 1 cell - surface localization led to enhanced pericellular proteolysis in U937 cells and PBMos Cell - surface ENO - 1 may act as a docking protein for PLG . 18 , 19 Consequently , we explored whether the LPS - induced increase in ENO - 1 cell - surface abundance might result in increased pericellu - lar proteolytic activity . The t - PA – dependent plasmin generation at the monocyte cell surface was evaluated by measuring hydrolysis of S - 2251 . Low basal proteolytic activity was found in unstimu - lated U937 cells and PBMos in the presence of 3 nM t - PA and 15 (cid:4) M Lys - PLG that was mildly affected by the presence of an antibody directed against the PLG binding site of ENO - 1 ( Figure 3A , B ) . After stimulation with LPS , cell - surface plasmin activity was increased by approximately 2 - fold in both U937 cells and PBMos ( Figure 3A ) . An antibody directed against the PLG binding site of ENO - 1 , but not an isotype control antibody , reduced plasmin proteolytic activity in both U937 cells and PBMos to basal levels observed in unstimulated cells ( Figure 3B ) . The lysine analog TXA blocked the bulk of plasmin formation by unstimulated and LPS - treated cells ( Figure 3B ) . Similarly , addition of (cid:1) 2 - PI together with PLG also blocked the bulk of plasmin formation by LPS - treated cells ( Figure 3B ) . This observation is in line with a previous study demonstrating that (cid:1) 2 - PI – derived peptides can block PLG binding to the surface of U937 cells . 33 Titration experiments , where the Lys - PLG concentration was varied between 2 . 5 (cid:4) M ( approxi - mating normal physiologic PLG concentrations 34 ) and 15 (cid:4) M , yielded similar results ( not shown ) . Together , these results indicate that the LPS - induced increase in cell - surface ENO - 1 density on U937 cells and PBMos was largely responsible for the elevated cell - surface plasmin formation in both cell types under these conditions . ENO - 1 – dependent directed invasion and migration of U937 cells and PBMos The importance of ENO - 1 – induced cell - surface plasmin activity in the directed migration , transmigration through epithelial monolay - ers , and matrix invasion of LPS - stimulated U937 cells and PBMos toward the chemokine MCP - 1 was examined . In unstimulated cells , inhibition of ENO - 1 with an anti – ENO - 1 antibody did not signiﬁcantly alter the directed migration of U937 cells or PBMos through 5 - (cid:4) m polycarbonate ﬁlters ( Figure 4A ) . Transmigration through a monolayer of human lung A549 epithelial cells and cell invasion into Matrigel also remained unaffected ( Figure 4B , C ) . Preincubation of U937 cells or PBMos with LPS resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in directed migration through the polycarbon - ate membrane , transmigration through a A549 cell monolayer , and Matrigel invasion ( Figure 4A - C ) . The presence of an anti – ENO - 1 antibody almost completely abrogated this LPS - induced increase in directed migration , transmigration , and invasion in both cell types ( Figure 4A - C ) . The impact of the LPS - induced increase in ENO - 1 cell - surface expression on the directed migration of U937 cells through the polycarbonate membrane was unexpected and was , therefore , conﬁrmed by visual inspection of transwell ﬁlters ( Figure S2 ) , where the increase in ENO - 1 cell - surface expression by LPS Figure 2 .

ENOLASE - 1 PROMOTES MONOCYTE MIGRATIONAND INVASION 5591 BLOOD , 28 MAY 2009 (cid:1) VOLUME 113 , NUMBER 22 For personal use only . on August 28 , 2017 . by guest www . bloodjournal . org From resulted in fewer U937 cells attached to the upper side of the transwell membrane compared with unstimulated cells , which is consistent with the increased directed migration seen with these cells in response to LPS stimulation . We have further demonstrated that plasmin formation is required for this process , because in the absence of Lys - PLG and t - PA , LPS stimulation of U937 cells and PBMos did not impact the directed migration of cells toward MCP - 1 ( Figure S3 ) . Together , these data demonstrate the impor - tance of ENO - 1 in the recruitment of cell - surface plasmin activity , leading to increased migratory , transmigratory , and invasive proper - ties of LPS - stimulated U937 cells and PBMos . Overexpression of ENO - 1 potentiated the directed migration , transmigration , and invasion of U937 cells To further assess the importance of ENO - 1 in the physiologic processes of monocytes , wild - type ENO - 1 ( ENO - 1WT ) or an ENO - 1 variant in which the PLG binding site was removed ( ENO - 1 (cid:6) PLG ) were overexpressed in U937 cells . Overexpression of ENO - 1 resulted in increased cytosolic and cell - membrane ENO - 1 levels ( Figure 5A ) . Enhanced cell - surface localization was also conﬁrmed by ﬂow cytometry ( Figure 5B left panel ) . In contrast to U937 cells that had been transfected with an empty control vector ( Figure 5B right panel ) , the LPS stimulation of ENO - 1WT – transfected cells produced only a small increase in cell - surface density of ENO - 1 ( Figure 5B middle panel ) . This indicates that overexpression of ENO - 1WT in U937 cells saturates the amount of this protein on the cell surface . Accordingly , overexpression of ENO - 1WT in unstimulated U937 cells resulted in strongly increased plasmin proteolytic activity ; however , plas - min generation was—in contrast to unstimulated , untransfected , or empty vector - transfected cells—only slightly further enhanced by LPS stimulation ( Figure 5C ) . Transfection of U937 cells with ENO - 1 (cid:6) PLG did not result in increased plasmin proteolytic activity irrespective of the presence of LPS . Next , the impact of overexpressing ENO - 1 on the directed migration , transmigration , and invasion properties of U937 cells was examined . In the presence of PLG and t - PA , overexpression of ENO - 1WT resulted in signiﬁcantly increased directed migration through the polycarbon - ate membrane ( Figure 5D ) , transmigration through a A549 cell monolayer ( Figure 5E ) , and invasion into Matrigel ( Figure 5F ) of U937 cells in response to MCP - 1 , compared with mock - transfected cells or to ENO - 1 (cid:6) PLG – expressing cells . The unexpected impact of ENO - 1WT overexpression on the directed migration through polycarbonate membranes was conﬁrmed by visual inspection of transwell ﬁlters ( Figure S4 ) , where overexpression of ENO - 1WT resulted in fewer cells attached to the upper side of the membrane compared with mock - or ENO - 1 (cid:6) PLG – transfected cells , which is consistent with the increased directed migration seen with ENO - 1WT overexpression . ENO - 1 overexpression increased recruitment of monocytic cells to the acutely inﬂamed lung As overexpression of ENO - 1 enhanced the directed migration , transmigration , and invasion of U937 cells in vitro , the role of ENO - 1 on monocyte recruitment in vivo was examined . We assessed the impact of ENO - 1 on monocytic cell recruitment to the alveolar compartment of the acutely inﬂamed lung . For this , U937 cells were ﬂuorescently labeled with PKH26 - PCL and injected intravenously 24 hours after intratracheal LPS administration . Mouse lungs were analyzed 5 hours after injection of the cells . In contrast to cells transfected with the pcDNA3 . 1 control vector or cells overexpressing ENO - 1 that lacked the PLG binding site ( ENO - 1 (cid:6) PLG ) , pronounced recruitment to the acutely inﬂamed lungs of cells overexpressing ENO - 1WT was observed ( Figure 6A ) , which was conﬁrmed by quantitative evaluation of the lung sections ( Figure 6B ) . Further evaluation of lung sections from LPS - challenged mice receiving monocytic cells overexpressing ENO - 1WT revealed accumulation of these cells within alveolar walls ( Figure 6C ) . Moreover , LPS - treated mice receiving mono - cytic cells overexpressing ENO - 1WT demonstrated an increased ﬂuorescent signal from PKH26 - PCL – labeled cells in bronchoalveo - lar lavage ( BAL ) ﬂuid , whereas animals that received mock - transfected cells or cells expressing the (cid:6) PLG variant of ENO - 1 remained at basal levels ( Figure 6D ) . Recruited U937 cells overexpressing ENO - 1WT in the lungs of LPS - treated mice exhibited strong staining for plasminogen ( Figure 6E ) , as did U937 cells recovered by BAL from treated mice ( Figure 6F ) . No differences were observed in the accumulation of U937 cells in the spleens of mice after intratracheal LPS application , irrespective of whether these cells expressed ENO - 1WT or the (cid:6) PLG variant of ENO - 1 ( Figure S5 ) .

The ENO - 1 mRNA levels in PBMos revealed no differences in ENO - 1 expression between pneumonia patients and healthy controls ( Figure 7A ) . However , similar to our in vitro data demonstrating increased cell - surface localization of ENO - 1 in response to LPS stimulation , membrane fractions of PBMos from pneumonia patients exhibited a signiﬁcantly elevated abundance of ENO - 1 compared with healthy controls ( Figure 7B , C ) . The el - evated abundance of ENO - 1 was associated with signiﬁcantly increased levels of PLG in cell - membrane fractions of PBMos from pneumonia patients ( Figure 7B , C ) . Dual staining with anti – ENO - 1 and anti - PLG antibodies also suggested an increased abundance of ENO - 1 and PLG , and a strong colocalization in PBMos from pneumonia patients ( Figure 7D ) . Lung sections from pneumonia patients revealed intense ENO - 1 staining in basal bronchial epithelial cells ( Figure 7Ei , ii ) as well as in mononuclear cells in the alveolar compartment ( Figure 7Eiii , iv ) . In control lungs , ENO - 1 staining was observed exclusively in bronchial epithelial cells ( Figure 7Ev - viii ) . Moreover , intense ENO - 1 stain - ing on lung mononuclear cells in pneumonia patients correlated with strong staining for PLG on these cells ( Figure 7F ) . Discussion Plasmin is a key enzyme of intravascular ﬁbrinolysis , but it is also known to have a broad spectrum of extravascular functions related to cell invasion processes , where the degradation of the extracellu - lar matrix is a prerequisite for cell migration across the matrix barrier . 13 - 15 The recruitment of PLG to the cell surface potentiates local plasmin generation and endows the cells with pericellular proteolytic activity . 10 - 17 These properties depend upon the capacity of PLG to bind to C - terminal lysine residues in its receptors . Therefore , the blockade ( by TXA ) or removal ( by plasma car - boxypeptidase B , pCPB ) of C - terminal lysine residues severely impairs plasmin generation and cell mobility . 18 , 25 The prominent role of the PLG system and PLG - PLG receptor interaction in the recruitment of inﬂammatory cells has been demonstrated in different inﬂammatory models conducted in PLG (cid:11) / (cid:11) 35 , 36 or pCPB (cid:11) / (cid:11) 37 mice . Despite the well - documented presence of ENO - 1 on the surface of monocytic cells , 18 , 19 the importance of ENO - 1 in the migration and invasion of these cells—in particular , when they are exposed to an inﬂammatory stimulus—has not been addressed in detail to date . Our data demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that LPS induces an increase in the cell - surface expression of ENO - 1 on monocytic cells and PBMos , which results in enhanced plasmin proteolytic activity at the cell surface . Consequently , the ENO - 1 – mediated increase in Figure 4 . ENO - 1 mediates the directed migration , transmigration , and invasion of LPS - activated U937 cells and human blood monocytes .

Previous studies have reported the differential regulation of PLG receptors by various stimuli , which indicates that changing environmental conditions may alter the surface proteolytic capaci - ties of cells . 38 , 39 In this regard , Felez et al 38 demonstrated elevated cell - surface PLG receptor expression on human monocytic cell lines after stimulation with phorbol ester or vitamin D - 3 . Of note , in the case of the human monocytic THP - 1 cell line , the up - regulation of PLG receptors on nonadherent THP - 1 cells required the presence of an adherent population of cells and was not observed when other inﬂammatory stimuli were used , including tumor necrosis factor - (cid:1) ( TNF - (cid:1) ) , interleukin - 1 (cid:1) ( IL - 1 (cid:1) ) , and LPS . 38 In contrast , our results demonstrated that LPS markedly up - regulated ENO - 1 density on the surface of U937 cells , which were maintained in suspension . These differences most likely arise from the distinct cell lines investigated and / or the different time points used to analyze PLG receptor expression . Moreover , Felez et al 38 examined the changes in the total number of PLG binding sites on the cell surface , whereas our study was strictly focused on ENO - 1 . We then expanded these observations , demonstrating that PBMos share the capacity to up - regulate cell - surface expression of ENO - 1 after LPS stimulation . The LPS - induced increase in ENO - 1 cell - surface expression on U937 cells and PBMos occurred rapidly , within 1 hour after LPS exposure . The rapid increase in cell surface – associated ENO - 1 strongly suggests the possibility of an enhanced transport of the molecule from the cytosol to the cell surface . Thus , ENO - 1 , which is already present in large quantities in the cytoplasm , may be actively trafﬁcked to the cell surface , allowing monocytes to rapidly react to inﬂammatory stimuli . In line with these ideas , we demonstrated a signiﬁcant increase in the amount of ENO - 1 associated with the cell - membrane fractions of U937 cells and human PBMos in response to LPS challenge , while the ENO - 1 content of the cytosolic fraction decreased , and no change in total ENO - 1 abundance was noted , at the mRNA or protein level . However , these observations do not exclude the possibility that activation of monocytes not only increased the amount of ENO - 1 on the cell surface but also induced a conformational change in Figure 5 . Overexpression of ENO - 1 by U937 cells increased cell - surface plasmin generation and enhanced directed migratory , transmigratory , and invasive properties .

Notably , no change in the amount of the PLG receptor annexin II at the cell surface was detected during the 6 - hour stimulation period ( M . W . , unpublished data , January 2008 ) . A possible explanation may be due to the short stimulation time . Consistent with the literature , the amount of annexin II on the cell surface of PBMos can change within days and may correlate with the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages , 40 which were previously shown to exhibit an additional increase in annexin II surface expression upon inﬂammatory stimulation with thioglyco - late . 40 In contrast , we observed that the cell - surface density of ENO - 1 on monocytes or monocytic cells is rather decreasing with the differentiation to macrophages ( M . W . , unpublished data , Janu - ary 2008 ) . To investigate the functional consequences of the modulation of ENO - 1 in monocytic cells and PBMos after inﬂammatory stimula - tion , 4 different assays were used . We demonstrated that the LPS - induced tPA - dependent increase in cell - surface plasmin activ - ity in U937 cells and PBMos was largely attributable to increased cell - surface expression of ENO - 1 under these conditions , because the presence of an anti – ENO - 1 antibody restored proteolytic activity to the basal levels observed in unstimulated cells . These observations were corroborated by the ﬁnding that overexpression of ENO - 1WT in unstimulated U937 cells , which saturated the amount of ENO - 1 on the cell surface , increased plasmin activity to a similar degree to that seen in LPS - stimulated cells . This effect was not observed when an ENO - 1 variant , in which the PLG binding site had been deleted , was used instead . Furthermore , we demonstrate that increased cell - surface expression of ENO - 1 contributes signiﬁcantly to the enhanced directed transmigration through lung epithelial cells and matrix invasion of LPS - stimulated U937 cells and PBMos . Once again , these observations were conﬁrmed in additional experiments where a strong increase in transmigration through lung epithelial cells , as well as matrix invasion of ENO - 1 – overexpressing U937 cells , was observed . Interestingly , both the LPS stimulation ( which increased ENO - 1 cell - surface expression ) and ENO - 1 overexpression also enhanced the directed migration of monocytes through the pores of a polycarbonate membrane . This observation was unexpected be - cause no degradation of extracellular matrix proteins is required for this process , although we demonstrated that plasmin formation is essential . Thus , ENO - 1 – mediated plasmin formation may directly activate the monocytes and , thereby , stimulate their migration . Indeed , plasmin speciﬁcally interacts with cell - surface receptors such as integrins and protease - activated receptors ( PARs ) , 41 - 43 activates intracellular signaling pathways in different cells ( for example , induction of the p38 MAPK and JAK / STAT pathways in human monocytes ) , 41 , 44 , 45 and plays a critical role in the actin cytoskeleton organization of monocytes and other cells , thereby signiﬁcantly enhancing the spreading and mobility of these Figure 6 .

Thus , plasmin generation may well have contributed to the observed enhancement in the migration of monocytes with increased ENO - 1 cell - surface expression through the pores of polycarbonate membrane . Together , these observations clearly suggest that increased cell - surface expression of ENO - 1 plays a crucial role in enhanced plasmin generation and cell mobility of monocytic cells when these cells are exposed to an inﬂammatory stimulus such as LPS . However , plasmin formation as well as directed migration and invasion of unstimulated U937 cells or PBMos were only slightly inhibited by anti – ENO - 1 antibodies , which is in line with a previous study reporting a minor role of membrane - associated ENO - 1 in PLG binding on native U937 cells . 25 These observations indicate that other proteins may also serve as PLG binding sites , which may be involved in pericellular proteolysis and associated processes as well , and that the relative importance of cell - surface PLG receptors may depend on whether or not cells were exposed to inﬂammatory stimuli . The degree of differentiation to macrophages may also inﬂuence the spectrum of cell - surface PLG receptors and their contribution to pericellular proteolytic activity . In this regard , it has previously been shown that annexin II may promote PLG activation and migration of unstimulated THP - 1 monocytic cells , 21 PBMos , 40 and cells of the murine macrophage RAW 264 . 7 cell line . 21 , 39 Furthermore , a Figure 7 .

A timely and comprehensive monocyte response under these conditions is crucial for clearing infection and controlling the inﬂammatory process . We have now demonstrated a pronounced increase in the recruitment of ENO - 1 – overexpressing monocytic cells to acutely inﬂamed mouse lungs , compared with mock - transfected cells and cells overexpressing the (cid:6) PLG variant of ENO - 1 . These data are in line with previous studies demonstrating that resident alveolar macrophages are rapidly replaced by re - cruited monocytes in endotoxin - induced lung inﬂammation , 46 and they expand those studies to include a novel , crucial role for ENO - 1 in this recruitment process . Several potential mechanisms exist by which elevated cell - surface expression of ENO - 1 , and the corre - sponding increase in cell - surface plasmin generation , may promote monocyte recruitment to the alveolar space of inﬂamed lungs . Plasmin itself may directly degrade extracellular matrix proteins , as well as ﬁbrin deposits that develop after tissue injury , thereby abolishing physical barriers . 13 - 15 In addition , enhanced ENO - 1 - mediated plasmin formation may indirectly promote monocyte recruitment by activating other matrix - degrading proteases such as matrix metalloproteinases , by regulating the expression , secretion , and activation of cytokines involved in the inﬂammatory process , or by inducing cellular signaling that may alter the migratory and invasive properties of monocytes . 43 , 44 , 47 - 50 Of note , Das et al recently demonstrated the importance of the PLG receptor histone H2B , rather than ENO - 1 , in macrophage recruitment into the peritoneum . 39 However , a different inﬂamma - tory stimulus was used in our model versus their model ( LPS vs thioglycolate ) . Moreover , the mechanisms of inﬂammatory cell recruitment and the contribution of different PLG receptors to this process may vary , depending on the organ or tissue target . Our data provide the ﬁrst evidence that ENO - 1 – mediated recruitment of monocytes to the acutely inﬂamed lung may be relevant in humans . In pneumonia patients , in contrast to control patients , intense ENO - 1 staining was observed in association with mononuclear cells of the alveolar compartment . Furthermore , PBMos from pneumonia patients revealed elevated cell - surface expression of ENO - 1 ( and PLG ) compared with healthy controls , which ﬁts nicely with our observation of increased ENO - 1 cell - surface localization on PBMos in response to LPS challenge . In conclusion , our study demonstrates that inﬂammatory stimu - lation of monocytic cells and PBMos induces rapid translocation of ENO - 1 to the cell surface , increasing local plasmin generation and , thereby , providing cells with enhanced migratory , transmigratory , and invasive properties , promoting their recruitment to the in - ﬂamed lung . Thus , the present study identiﬁed an important and functionally relevant mechanism of inﬂammatory cell invasion to sites of inﬂamed tissue mediated by increased cell - surface expres - sion of ENO - 1 .
