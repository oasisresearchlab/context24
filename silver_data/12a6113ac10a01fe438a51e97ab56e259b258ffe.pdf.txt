L E T T E R S 246 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 7 | NUMBER 3 | MARCH 2005 Phosphoregulation of Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin assembly during receptor - mediated endocytosis Jiro Toshima 1 , Junko Y . Toshima 1 , Adam C . Martin 1 and David G . Drubin 1 , 2 In both yeast and mammals , endocytic internalization is accompanied by a transient burst of actin polymerization 1 , 2 . The yeast protein kinases Prk1p and Ark1p , which are related to the mammalian proteins GAK and AAK1 , are key regulators of this process 3 – 6 . However , the molecular mechanism ( s ) by which they regulate actin assembly at endocytic sites have not yet been determined . The Eps15 - like yeast protein Pan1p is a Prk1p substrate that is essential for endocytic internalization and for proper actin organization 7 – 9 . Pan1p is an Arp2 / 3 activator and here we show that this activity is dependent on F - actin binding . Mutation of all 15 Prk1p - targeted threonines in Pan1p to alanines mimicked the ark1 ∆ prk1 ∆ phenotype , demonstrating that Pan1p is a key Prk1p target in vivo . Moreover , phosphorylation by Prk1p inhibited the ability of Pan1p to bind to F - actin and to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex , thereby identifying the endocytic phosphoregulation mechanism of Prk1p . We conclude that Prk1p phosphorylation of Pan1p shuts off Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization on endocytic vesicles , allowing them to fuse with endosomes . Endocytic internalization involves an intricately choreographed series of steps , culminating in a burst of actin polymerization that is concomitant with internalization 1 , 2 . However , the mechanisms that specify the order and timing of these steps are not known . Actin polymerization is thought to drive membrane invagination , or vesicle fission , or both , and therefore must only occur when the endocytic complex is fully assembled and when the cargo molecules are appropriately docked . In addition , it is also important that actin polymerization is stopped after internalization is complete , to allow endocytic vesicles to fuse with endosomes 4 . Therefore , actin polymerization must not only occur at the right time and place , but it must also occur for the appropriate duration . The Arp2 / 3 complex seems to have a key role in actin assembly at endocytic sites . In mammalian cells and yeast , several Arp2 / 3 activators associate with endocytic sites 10 . In yeast , the Arp2 / 3 complex and the Arp2 / 3 activators Pan1p and Las17p are essential for endocytosis 11 , 12 . Either of these Arp2 / 3 activators might therefore be key targets for the regulation of actin assembly during endocytosis . 1 Department of Molecular and Cell Biology , 16 Barker Hall , University of California , Berkeley , CA 94720 - 3202 , USA . 2 Correspndence should be addressed to D . G . D : ( e - mail : drubin @ socrates . berkeley . edu ) Published online : 13 February 2005 ; DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncb1229 Although the mechanisms that regulate actin assembly at endocytic sites are not known at present , the protein kinases Prk1p and Ark1p are good candidates for regulators 3 – 6 . These kinases phosphorylate several endocytic proteins , including Pan1p ( refs 5 – 7 , 13 ) . Moreover , they can negatively regulate the formation of a complex between the endocytic proteins Pan1p , Sla1p and End3p ( refs 6 , 7 ) . Finally , when Prk1p kinase activity was inhibited using a chemical - genet - ics approach , massive actin filament networks quickly accumulated around endocytic membranes in an Arp2 / 3 - dependent manner , indi - cating that actin nucleation on endocytic membranes is tightly regu - lated by Prk1p ( ref . 4 ) . Importantly , how Prk1p and Ark1p regulate actin assembly at endocytic membranes is not known . Pan1p contains 15 Prk1p consensus sequences ( LxxQxTG ) in its amino - terminal long repeat ( LR ) regions 7 . To test whether constitu - tive dephosphorylation of Pan1p would result in constitutive associa - tion between the endocytic machinery and the actin cytoskeleton , we mutated all 15 potential Prk1p phosphorylation sites in Pan1p to alanine ( pan1 - 15TA ) , and integrated this mutant into the endogenous PAN1 locus ( Fig . 1a ) . The Pan1 - 15TAp mutant was expressed at similar levels to the wild - type protein ( Fig . 1a , bottom - right panels ) . Similar to ark1 ∆ prk1 ∆ cells 3 , pan1 - 15TA cells displayed large actin clumps and a defect in fluid - phase endocytosis ( Fig . 1b ) . However , the defect in the pan1 - 15TA mutant is not as pronounced as that in the ark1 ∆ prk1 ∆ mutant because the pan1 - 15TA mutant still contained many normal - looking cortical actin patches ( Fig . 1b , centre panel , and see Supplementary Information , Fig . S3b , c ) , indicating that other Ark1p / Prk1p targets are also important for endocytic function . In wild - type cells , actin associates with endo - cytic markers for about 15 s , and therefore colocalizes with only 30 % of the Pan1p patches , which are those patches engaged in the final steps of the internalization pathway 2 . However , in the pan1 - 15TA mutant , more than 90 % of the Pan1 - 15TAp – GFP ( green fluorescent protein ) structures colocalized with either actin clumps or with smaller , periph - eral actin patches ( Fig . 1c ) . Previous studies reported that endocytic proteins such as Sla2p ( Hip1R - related protein ) and Ent1p ( epsin - related protein ) localize to the actin clumps in ark1 ∆ prk1 ∆ mutants 3 , 5 . GFP - tagged Ent1p , Sla1p and Sla2p , which normally only partially colocalize with actin patches , similarly colocalized with F - actin in the clumps and print ncb1229 . indd 246 print ncb1229 . indd 246 15 / 2 / 05 5 : 22 : 58 pm 15 / 2 / 05 5 : 22 : 58 pm Nature PublishingGroup © 2005 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 7 | NUMBER 3 | MARCH 2005 247 L E T T E R S patches ( Fig . 1c ) . By contrast , GFP - tagged Dnm1p ( dynamin - related GTP - binding protein that is involved in mitochondrial function ) did not localize in the actin clumps ( Fig . 1c ) . These findings indicate that constitutive dephosphorylation of Pan1p leads to a stable association between endocytic proteins and F - actin structures . In support of this conclusion , in pan1 - 15TA cells the lipophilic dye FM4 - 64 , which is a marker for plasma - membrane endocytosis , localized to peripheral actin patches and actin clumps 15 min after internalization ( Fig . 1d ) , and later accumulated in the vacuole ( data not shown ) . Because Pan1p is an activator of the Arp2 / 3 complex 12 , it was pos - sible that constitutively unphosphorylated Pan1p caused actin - clump formation in association with the endocytic machinery due to con - stitutive activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex . A loss - of - function allele of PRK1 was identified as a suppressor of pan1 - 4 ( ref . 7 ) , indicating that Prk1p negatively regulates Pan1p function in vivo . Therefore , we investigated whether Prk1p inhibits the Arp2 / 3 activation activity of Pan1p . We purified Pan1p using the tandem affinity purification method ( see Methods ; Fig . 2a and 2b ) . As previously reported 7 , purified Prk1p strongly phosphorylates Pan1p ( Fig . 2c ) . In the absence of Prk1p , Pan1p strongly activated the Arp2 / 3 complex , greatly increasing the rate of actin polymerization ( Fig . 2d ) . By contrast , pre - incubation of Pan1p with Prk1p markedly reduced its Arp2 / 3 activation activity , completely inhibiting Pan1p after 10 min ( Fig . 2d ) . To rule out the possibility that the Prk1p inhibition was due to effects on other components of the reac - tion , we next purified phosphorylated Pan1p that completely lacked Prk1p ( Fig . 2c , far right panel ) . Absence of Prk1p was substantiated by immunoblotting with anti - Prk1p antibody ( data not shown ) . Whereas unphosphorylated Pan1p activated the Arp2 / 3 complex , phosphorylated Pan1p had markedly reduced activity ( Fig . 2e ) . As a further test of this conclusion , we purified Pan1 - 15TAp and examined its activity in the absence and presence of Prk1p . Pan1 - 15TAp showed essentially the same activity or even a slightly higher activity compared with wild - type Pan1p , a b d c Pan1p LR1 LR2 EH EH CC A PR w t P a n1 - 15 T A anti - Pan1p anti - Act1p A Pan1 - 15TAp wt GFP Rd − Phalloidin Merge pan1 - 15TA ark1 ∆ prk1 ∆ R d − p h a ll o i d i n p a n1 - 15 T A p a n1 - 15 T A Lu c i f e r y e ll o w Abp1 − GFP FM4 - 64 Merge Pan1 - 15TAp Sla1p Ent1p Sla2p Dnm1p Figure 1 Construction and characterization of a Pan1p phosphorylation - site mutant .

Taken together , these results demonstrate that the Arp2 / 3 activation activity of Pan1p is nega - tively regulated by Prk1p phosphorylation . To test whether the N - terminal fragment of Pan1p can inhibit the activity of full - length Pan1p , the N - terminal fragment ( Pan1 ∆ C ) was purified and phosphorylated by Prk1p ( Fig . 2a , b , and see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1a ) . The phosphorylated Pan1 ∆ C inhibited the activity of both full - length Pan1p and of Pan1p lack - ing the N - terminus ( Pan1 ∆ LR12 ) ( Fig . 2a , b , and see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1b , c ) . Unphosphorylated Pan1 ∆ C also slightly inhibited this activity ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1a , b ) , possibly because the N - terminal fragment becomes partially phospho - rylated during purification . These results indicate that the phospho - rylated N - terminus of Pan1p can directly bind to the Pan1p carboxy terminus and inhibit the Arp2 / 3 activation activity of Pan1p . Pan1p is the only known Arp2 / 3 complex activator that has not been shown to bind to either G - or F - actin .

To identify the region through which Pan1p binds to F - actin , we purified tandem affinity purification ( TAP ) - tagged Pan1p containing deletions of the LR regions ( ∆ LR12 ) , the LR regions and the coiled - coil region ( ∆ LR12CC ) , or the C - terminal region includ - ing the coiled - coil region ( ∆ C ) ( Fig . 2a , b ) . Pan1 - ∆ LR12 could bind to F - actin , but neither ∆ LR12CC nor ∆ C bound to F - actin ( Fig . 3c , d ) . To investigate whether the F - actin binding activity of Pan1p is required for Arp2 / 3 - complex activation , pyrene - actin assembly assays were per - formed with the various F - actin binding mutants of Pan1p . ∆ LR1 and ∆ LR12 mutants could still bind to actin . The Arp2 / 3 - activating activi - ties of these mutants compared with full - length Pan1p were decreased by only around 40 % ( comparing slopes of assembly curves ) ( Fig . 3e ) . However , the two mutants that were almost completely deficient for F - actin binding — ∆ LR12CC and ∆ C — completely lacked Arp2 / 3 - activating activity ( Fig . 3e ) . Because the F - actin binding activity of Pan1p seems to be required for activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex , it was possible that Prk1p might inhibit the Arp2 / 3 activation activity of Pan1p by preventing binding to F - actin . In support of this possibility , the F - actin binding activity of phosphorylated Pan1p was markedly decreased ( Fig . 3f ) , indicating that Prk1p inactivates Pan1p , at least in part , by preventing its association with F - actin . Next , we searched for an actin - binding motif in the coiled - coil region and found a WH2 - like motif , similar to that conserved in various actin - binding proteins , including some Arp2 / 3 - complex activators 14 ( Fig . 4a ) . To test whether this region is necessary for the Pan1p actin - binding activ - ity , we made a pan1 construct in which two conserved lysine residues — K1156 and K1157 — were substituted with glutamic acid ( pan1 - KE ) . a b e f c d Actin ( µ M ) S P S P S P S P S P S P S P 0 0 0 . 625 1 . 25 2 . 5 5 . 0 S P S P S P S P S P S P wt S P Pan1 - ∆ LR12 S P Pan1 - ∆ LR12CC S P Pan1 - ∆ C wt ∆ LR12 ∆ LR12CC ∆ C 0 . 15 0 . 3 0 . 625 1 . 25 2 . 5 5 . 0 M r ( K ) M r ( K ) M r ( K ) 223 223135112 53 223 135112 53 135112 53 - Pan1p - Actin Coomassie Coomassie Coomassie 100 80 60 40 20 0 0 4 3 2 1 5 B i n d i n g r a t i o ( p e r ce n t a g e ) 100 80 60 40 20 0 B i n d i n g r a t i o ( p e r ce n t a g e ) Actin concentration ( µ M ) Actin Actin pPan1p 1 . 0 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 200 1 , 400 1 , 200 1 , 000 800 600 400 1 , 600 0 Time ( s ) Actin Actin + Arp2 / 3 + WT + Pan1p - ∆ LR1 + Pan1p - ∆ LR12 + Pan1p - ∆ LR12CC + Pan1p - ∆ C N o r m a li z e d f l u o r e s ce n ce ( Actin µ m ) Figure 3 Pan1p binds to F - actin through its coiled - coil domain .

In addition , the Pan1 - KEp mutant , similar to the Pan1 - 101p mutant that changes four resi - dues ( DDGW ) that are required for Arp2 / 3 binding to alanine , almost completely lacked Arp2 / 3 - complex activation activity ( Fig . 2a , 4c ) . These results indicate that the WH2 - like motif of Pan1p is necessary for Arp2 / 3 - complex activation . We also purified the Pan1 WH2 - like motif as a glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) fusion protein and tested its ability to bind to G - actin . Pull - down assays demonstrated that , unlike GST – Las17 - WCA , GST – Pan1 - WH2 does not bind to G - actin ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S2a ) . In addition , the WH2 - like motif did not inhibit spontaneous actin nucleation or pointed - end elongation 15 , further demonstrating that it is unable to bind to G - actin ( see Supplementary Information , Fig .

However , when combined with the arp2 - 1 mutation , it caused synthetic sensitivity to formamide and latrunculin - A ( Fig . 4e and data not shown ) . Unlike pan1 - KE , a mutation in the Arp2 / 3 binding region , pan1 - 101 , showed synthetic lethality with the arp2 - 1 mutant at 34 o C ( ref . 12 ; Fig . 4e ) , indicating that the pan1 - KE mutation is function - ally less severe than pan1 - 101 . The similar phenotypes of pan1 - KE and pan1 - 101 further support the conclusion that the actin - binding activity of Pan1p is required for its ability to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex in vivo . Our data indicate that the actin clumps that form in pan1 - 15TA cells are the result of uncontrolled actin polymerization that is mediated by unphosphorylated Pan1p . To test this hypothesis , we first made a pan1 - 15TA mutant , in which mutations were also introduced into the WH2 - like region ( pan1 - 15TA - KE ) that is required for Pan1p to bind F - actin . Whereas pan1 - 15TA resulted in the formation of actin clumps , clump for - mation was suppressed in pan1 - 15TA - KE cells ( Fig . 4f and Supplementary Information , Fig . S3b , c ) . Furthermore , by measuring the internaliza - tion of radiolabelled α - factor , we found that the pan1 - KE mutation suppressed the endocytosis defect that was observed in the pan1 - 15TA mutant ( Fig . 4g ) . The pan1 - KE mutation also suppressed the temperature sensitivity of ark1 ∆ prk1 ∆ cells at 37 o C ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S3a ) , and partially suppressed the phenotype of actin - clump forma - tion in ark1 ∆ prk1 ∆ cells ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S3b , c ) . Although 10 – 20 % of ark1 ∆ prk1 ∆ cells are abnormally large and have extremely large actin clumps , such cells were rarely observed in ark1 ∆ prk1 ∆ pan1 - KE cells ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S3b , c ) . To exclude the possibility that actin clumps in pan1 - 15TA cells result from Pan1p oligomerization 16 , and that the pan1 - KE mutation simply interferes with Pan1p oligomerization , we examined the oligomeriza - tion state of Pan1 - KEp . Co - immunoprecipitation using TAP - tagged Pan1p and Myc - tagged Pan1p , or TAP - tagged Pan1 - KEp and Myc - tagged Pan1 - KEp , showed that Pan1p and Pan1 - KEp both oligomerize to the same extent ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S3d ) . We also tested for changes in Pan1p – End3p complex integrity in ark1 ∆ prk1 ∆ cells , because actin - clump formation might be secondary to uncon - trolled Pan1p - complex formation . We purified endogenous Pan1p complex from wild - type and ark1 ∆ prk1 ∆ cells using a modified form of the TAP tag 17 . The amount of End3p that co - purified with Pan1p was about the same in wild - type and ark1 ∆ prk1 ∆ cells ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S3e ) . Therefore , actin clumps seem not to result from increased Pan1p - complex formation . The pan1 - KE mutant has no obvious defect in receptor internalization , indicating that other Arp2 / 3 - complex activators function redundantly with Pan1p . Consistent with this hypothesis , the Arp2 / 3 - complex acti - vators Las17p and Abp1p are also localized at actin patches when actin is assembling at those sites 2 . To test whether either activator functions redundantly with Pan1p , we made a pan1 mutant containing muta - tions in both the acidic and WH2 - like regions ( pan1 - KE101 , which is expected to have less activity than pan1 - KE ) , a las17 mutant lacking the Arp2 / 3 - activation domain ( las17 ∆ WCA ) and an abp1 ∆ mutant . Each allele individually has only modest effects on receptor internalization ( Fig . 5a , b ) . Abp1p is not crucial for the internalization step of endocy - tosis , because abp1 ∆ cells have only a modest effect on receptor inter - nalization and no additive effect with pan1 - KE101 , las17 ∆ WCA or the pan1 - KE101 las17 ∆ WCA double mutant ( Fig . 5a – c ) . By contrast , the pan1 - KE101 mutant had a synthetic defect in internalization when com - bined with the las17 ∆ WCA mutant ( Fig . 5c ) . As Pan1 - KE101p might still retain some activity 12 , we next used a Pan1 C - terminal deletion mutant ( pan1 ∆ 855 - 1480 ) , which lacks actin binding and Arp2 / 3 - activating regions . Combining the pan1 ∆ 855 - 1480 and las17 ∆ WCA mutations caused a severe reduction of internalization ( Fig . 5d ) , indicating that the Arp2 / 3 activation activity of Pan1p is important for receptor - medi - ated endocytosis and can be partially substituted by Las17p . On the basis of the data presented above and in previous studies , we propose the following model for the role of Pan1p phosphorylation in regulation of the internalization step of endocytosis ( Fig . 5e ) . ( 1 ) Prior to the initiation of endocytosis , Pan1p is dephosphorylated by a yet - to - be - identified phosphatase . Once endocytosis begins , Pan1p is targeted to the plasma membrane and makes a complex with other endocytic proteins . Pan1p directly associates with Sla1p , End3p and Ent1p 18 , 19 . Therefore , Pan1p is likely to interact with endocytic membranes through the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding ENTH ( epsin N - terminal homology ) domain of Ent1p , and / or the ANTH domain of Sla2p , a protein that has been shown to associate with Sla1p 20 . ( 2 ) After endocytic vesicles are internalized into the cytosol , Pan1p is phosphorylated by Prk1p and dissociates from the other endocytic components . The association of Pan1p – Sla1p – End3p in a complex has been suggested to be negatively regulated by Prk1p 6 , 7 . We further demonstrated that Pan1p associates directly and tightly with F - actin via the WH2 - like motif in the coiled - coil region , and that this interaction is inhibited by phosphorylation . Therefore , phosphorylation by Prk1p is expected to dissociate Pan1p from F - actin . ( 3 ) As a result , this inactivates the Arp2 / 3 activation activity of Pan1p . As the final step , endocytic vesicles are transported to the early endosome , and phospho - rylated Pan1p and other endocytic proteins are returned to the plasma membrane to repeat this cycle . ( 4 ) When constitutively unphosphorylated Pan1p ( Pan1 - 15TAp ) is recruited to sites of endocytosis , it activates actin assembly at those sites without the delay that is observed in wild - type cells 2 . ( 5 ) Disruption of the normal phosphorylation cycle of Pan1p can cause the formation of actin clumps . In pan1 - 15TA , accumulation of non - phosphorylated Pan1p leads to constitutive actin assembly and crosslink - ing of actin filaments in association with endocytic membranes , resulting in actin - clump formation and inefficient vesicle fusion . The lack of a pronounced phenotype of the pan1 - KE101 mutant , and the moderate synthetic effect on receptor internalization of this mutant in combination with the las17 ∆ WCA mutant , indicates that other Arp2 / 3 - complex activators might function redundantly with them . Mutants of Abp1p have no additive effect with these activator mutants . However , Myo3p and Myo5p , other Arp2 / 3 - complex activators , are reported to be localized at actin patches 21 and to show genetic redundancy with Las17p 22 . Therefore , Myo3p and Myo5p are additional candidates that might function redundantly with Pan1p . Compared to pan1 - 15TA - KE cells , suppression of the actin defects of ark1 ∆ prk1 ∆ cells by the pan1 - KE mutation is less pronounced , indicating that other Arp2 / 3 activa - tors might be activated in ark1 ∆ prk1 ∆ cells . Interestingly , Las17p , the yeast WASP - related protein , might be a Prk1p target as it contains one LxxQxTG motif and one QxTG motif . Furthermore , the Prk1p target , Sla1p , inhibits Arp2 / 3 - complex activation via Las17p 23 . Therefore , it will be of a great interest to determine whether Las17p is regulated directly , indirectly , or both , by Prk1p . After endocytic coat assembly and following vesicle scission , all of the endocytic components must be disassembled before vesicle - endosome fusion , and the coat components must be recycled for continued vesi - cle formation . Reversible coat - protein phosphorylation is an attractive print ncb1229 . indd 252 print ncb1229 . indd 252 15 / 2 / 05 5 : 23 : 15 pm 15 / 2 / 05 5 : 23 : 15 pm Nature PublishingGroup © 2005 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 7 | NUMBER 3 | MARCH 2005 253 L E T T E R S mechanism for regulating vesicle - coat assembly and actin polymeriza - tion . In neuronal cells , the endocytic proteins dynamin , synaptojanin , amphiphysin , Eps15 and epsin , are phosphorylated in resting nerve terminals , but dephosphorylation of these proteins occurs rapidly to promote vesicle formation and / or recycling in response to neuronal stimulation 24 . In vitro studies demonstrating that dephosphorylation of amphiphysin , dynamin and epsin promotes their assembly into com - plexes with clathrin and AP2 25 also support this idea . In yeast , several endocytic coat proteins , including yeast epsin ( Ent1 / 2p ) and yeast Eps15 ( Pan1p ) , have been identified as Prk1p targets or potential targets 5 , 6 , 13 , 26 , and Prk1p kinase inhibition seems to result in constitutive actin assembly on endocytic membranes 4 . Here , we showed that the pan1 - 15TA muta - tion also seems to result in constitutive actin assembly , and to result in endocytic vesicle accumulation . Therefore , Pan1p phosphorylation seems to be of key importance for shutting down the activities and interactions that are responsible for vesicle formation . Suppression of the endocytosis defects of pan1 - 15TA in a pan1 - 15TA - KE mutant further suggests that downregulation of actin assembly on endocytic membranes is an impor - tant prerequisite to vesicle uncoating . How endocytic phosphorylation cycles are regulated is an important question for the future . METHODS Yeast strains , growth conditions and plasmids . The yeast strains used in this study are listed in the Supplementary Information , Table S1 . GFP tags were inte - grated at the C terminus of each gene as described previously 2 . pan1 mutants were integrated as follows . First , to create a pan1 integration plasmid , the Xmn I - Dra I fragment of the PAN1 gene was cloned into pBluescript II SK , and the Sal I fragment of the LEU2 gene was inserted into the Sal I site 154 base pairs upstream of the PAN1 open reading frame ( ORF ) . The mutated Msc I - Nhe I pan1 fragments were used to replace the PAN1 gene in the integration plasmid . To integrate pan1 mutants at the endogenous locus , the integration plasmids were digested with Sac I and Xba I , and transformed into pan1∆ : : HIS3 / PAN1 diploid strains . Integrated pan1 mutants were selected on SC plates lacking leucine and sporulated to obtain pan1 mutants . Recombinant DNA manipulations . The Prk1p expression plasmid was constructed by inserting the PRK1 ORF into BamH I - and Not I - digested pRS426 containing the GAL1 - 10 promoter , a tobacco etch virus ( TEV ) protease recognition site , and encoding the Myc epitope 23 . The TAP - tagged Pan1p expression plasmid was constructed by inserting the PAN1 ORF into the BamH I site of pBS1479 ( ref . 27 ) . ∆ LR1 and ∆ LR12CC were gen - erated by removing the Msc I - EcoR I fragment ( nt 288 – 1159 ) or the Msc I - Nhe I fragment ( nt 288 – 3751 ) from the PAN1 ORF , respectively . ∆ LR12 was generated by digesting the PCR product ( nt 2014 – 2844 ) — amplified by primers 5 ´ - TACTCGAGGATATCGAAGCCAATCCCCAATGTC - 3´and 5´ - CCCTATGCCAAATTCCCATC - 3´ — with EcoR V , and inserting the frag - ment into Msc I - EcoR V - digested PAN1 . Pan1 - ∆ C was generated by digesting the PCR product ( nt 1150 – 2014 ) — amplified by primers 5´ - TACTCGAGAG ATCTGACATTGGGGATTGGCT - 3´ and 5´ - CTTCCGCAAACGATGCC - 3´ — with EcoR I and Bgl II , and ligating the fragment into EcoR I - digested PAN1 . Phosphorylation - site mutants were constructed using a Quickchange multi - site - mutagenesis kit ( Strategene , La Jolla , CA ) . Protein expression and purification . DDY1810 strains expressing the relevant plas - mid were grown to saturation in 20 ml SD supplemented with all amino acids except uracil . This inoculum was added to 1 . 5 litres of synthetic media with 2 % w / v raffi - nose and dropout uracil , and was grown to an OD600 of 1 . 0 . Protein expression was induced following the addition of 30 g bacto - peptone , 15 g yeast extract and a final concentration of 2 % w / v galactose for 8 – 12 h , as described previously 23 . Cells were harvested and lysed as described previously 28 . TAP - tagged proteins were purified according to the tandem affinity purification method 27 . TEV – Myc - tagged Prk1p , 23 , Arp2 / 3 complex 29 and yeast actin 28 were purified as described previously . Actin assembly assay . To measure actin - assembly kinetics , pyrene fluorescence was monitored as described previously 28 . To remove actin oligomers before use , actin ( 2 µ M yeast monomeric actin and 0 . 1 µ M pyrene - labelled rabbit muscle actin ) was centrifuged at 350 , 000 g in a TLA100 rotor ( Beckman , Palo Alto , CA ) for 45 min . Reaction conditions were as follows : 53 µ l actin in G - buffer ( 50 mM Tris - Cl , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM ATP and 0 . 2 mM DTT ) was mixed rap - idly with 7 µ l initiation buffer ( 250 mM KCl , 20 mM MgCl 2 and 5 mM ATP ) and 10 µ l HEKG5 ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM EDTA , 50 mM KCl and 5 % glycerol ) containing 10 nM Arp2 / 3 , and / or Pan1p , and then immediately transferred to a cuvette in the fluorometer . Fluorescence data were collected by using a Fluoromax 3 fluorometer ( Jobin - Yvon Horiba , Edison , NJ ) . Actin filament co - sedimentation . Pan1p was added to different concen - trations of assembled yeast actin , incubated for 30 min at room tempera - ture , and centrifuged for 30 min in a TLA100 rotor at 350 , 000 g . Pellets and supernatants were separated on 9 % SDS - PAGE gels that were subsequently stained with Coomassie blue . In vitro kinase assay and immunoblotting . In vitro kinase assays were per - formed as described previously 30 . Samples were separated using 7 . 5 % SDS - PAGE gels that were subsequently stained with Coomassie blue . Gels were scanned using a PhosphorImager SI450 ( Amersham Biosciences , Piscataway , NJ ) , and the images were analysed using ImageQuant version 1 . 2 software ( Amersham Biosciences ) . Immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously 30 . Anti - Pan1p antibody 12 and anti - Act1p antibody 28 were used at a dilution of 1 : 1000 . Immunoreactive protein bands were visualized , using a Supersignal west pico chemiluminescent substrate ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) . Fluorescence microscopy . Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Nikon TE300 microscope equipped with a ×100 / NA 1 . 4 objective and Orca - 100 cooled charge - coupled device camera ( Hamamatsu , Hamamatsu city , Japan ) . Yeast cells were fixed and processed for rhodamine - phalloidin staining as described previously 3 .

At least 200 hundred cells were counted for each mutant . d , the pan1 - KE mutation does not affect the oligomerization state of Pan1p . Cells expressing TAP - tagged Pan1p ( lane 1 ) , TAP - tagged Pan1 - KEp ( lane 2 ) , TAP - tagged Pan1p and Myc - tagged Pan1p ( lane 3 ) , or TAP - tagged Pan1 - KEp and Myc - tagged Pan1 - KEp ( lane 4 ) were lysed and immunoprecipitations were performed with an anti - Myc antibody . The precipitates were immunoblotted with rabbit IgG to detect the TAP tag ( left panel ) , or with an anti - Myc antibody ( right panel ) . Expression of TAP - tagged Pan1p and Pan1 - KEp was analyzed by pull - down with IgG - coupled beads and blotting with rabbit IgG ( lower panel ) . e , Coomassie - stained gels showing purification of Pan1p from wild - type cells ( lane 1 ) , or ark1 ∆ prk1 ∆ cells ( lane 2 ) . TAP tags were integrated at the C terminus of the PAN1 gene in wild - type or ark1 ∆ prk1 ∆ cells , and used to purify endogenous Pan1p complex as described 3 . Pan1p and End3p were identified by immunoblotting and mass spectrometric analysis ( not shown ) . S U P P L E M E N TA RY I N F O R M AT I O N 4 WWW . NATURE .

The Pan1 - Myc and Pan1 - KE - Myc expression plasmids were constructed by inserting the PAN1 or pan1 - KE ORF into BamHI - digested pRS426 containing the GAL1 - 10 promoter , a TEV protease recognition site , and encoding the myc epitope 1 . The plasmid encoding GST - Las17 - WCA ( a . a . 535 - 633 ) was generated by amplifying the Las17 fragment with 5’ - GCGCGATGCATTTACCAATCATCACCATTGTCC - 3’ and 5’ - GCGCGGGATCCATGCCAGCTA CATCAACATCC - 3’ , and subcloning into BamH I and Nsi I sites of pGAT2 2 . GST - Pan1 - WH2 ( a . a . 1134 - 1184 ) was generated by amplifying the Pan1 fragment with 5’ - CGCGGATCCGAATCCGATGATGAAGATG - 3’ and 5’ - CCGGAATTCGTCTCCTCTTCGTCACTTTC - 3’ , and subcloning into BamH I and EcoR I sites of pGEX - 2T ( Pharmacia ) . Protein Expression and Purification . GST - Las17 - WCA and GST - Pan1 - WH2 were expressed in , and purified from , bacteria . BL21 - DE3 strains expressing the plas - mid encoding GST - Las17 - WCA or GST - Pan1 - WH2 were grown at 37 o C to OD 600 of 1 . 0 . Protein expression was induced by the addition IPTG to 0 . 1 mM . After 1 - 4 h , cells were harvested , washed with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , and resuspended in 50 µ l of ice - cold PBS per ml of culture . The suspended cells were sonicated for 1 - 2 min and lysed by the addition Triton X - 100 to a final concentration of 1 % . The lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 12 , 000 rpm in a SA600 rotor ( Sorvall ) , and then 100 - 500 µ l glutathione - sepharose ( Pharmacia ) was added to the lysate . After rotating for 2 h at 4 o C , glutathione - sepharose was pelleted at 3000 rpm for 3 min and washed 3 times with PBS . Bound proteins were cleaved from the matrix by the addition of 2 U / ml thrombin in PBS . SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION REFERENCES 1 . Rodal , A . A . , Manning , A . L . , Goode , B . L . & Drubin , D .
