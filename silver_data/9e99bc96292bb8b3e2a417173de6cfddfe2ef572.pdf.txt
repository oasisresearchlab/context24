Introduction Psychological essentialism states that people act as if concepts have some “essen - tial” properties that are both criterial for category membership and responsible for other “surface” features of concepts ( Medin & Ortony , 1989 ) . Recently , Strevens ( 2000 ) argued that an alternative formulation , which he calls the minimal hypoth - esis , provides an account of the psychological data equal to any essentialist theory , but has the additional virtue of being more parsimonious . In this commentary , we will argue that the minimal hypothesis is insufﬁciently constrained to capture key phenomena associated with essentialist theories . 2 . Minimal hypothesis The minimal hypothesis states that there are causal laws connecting kind member - ship with observable properties termed “K - laws” ( kind laws ) . K - laws are of the form “something about being an X causes Y” ( e . g . something about being a tiger causes stripes ) . Such a notion of kindhood allows for a distinction between essential and surface properties . For instance , if “tigers have stripes” is a K - law , then tigers have stripes essentially ( i . e . the inference from tiger to stripes is non - defeasible ) . In W .
