In the presence of probe - sample adhesive interactions , which are common especially during retraction of the rigid tip from soft materials , the Hertzian models are no longer ad - equate . A number of theories ( e . g . , Johnson – Kendall – Roberts and Derjaguin – Muller – Toporov ) , covering the full range of sample compliance relative to adhesive force and tip radius , are available for analysis of such data . We incorporated Pietrement and Troyon’s approximation ( 2000 , “General Equations Describing Elastic Indentation Depth and Normal Contact Stiffness Versus Load , ” J . Colloid Interface Sci . , 226 ( 1 ) , pp . 166 – 171 ) of the Maugis – Dugdale model into the automated procedure . The scheme developed for the processing of Hertzian data was extended to allow for adhesive contact by applying the Pietrement – Troyon equation . Retraction force - displacement data from the indentation of polyvinyl alcohol gels were processed using the customized software . Many of the retrac - tion curves exhibited strong adhesive interactions that were absent in extension . We compared the values of Young’s modulus extracted from the retraction data to the values obtained from the extension data and from macroscopic uniaxial compression tests . Ap - plication of adhesive contact models and the automated scheme to the retraction curves yielded average values of Young’s modulus close to those obtained with Hertzian models for the extension curves . The Pietrement – Troyon equation provided a good ﬁt to the data as indicated by small values of the mean - square error . The Maugis – Dugdale theory is capable of accurately modeling adhesive contact between a rigid spherical indenter and a soft , elastic sample . Pietrement and Troyon’s empirical equation greatly simpliﬁes the theory and renders it compatible with the general automation strategies that we devel - oped for Hertzian analysis . Our comprehensive algorithm for automated extraction of Young’s moduli from AFM indentation data has been expanded to recognize the presence of either adhesive or Hertzian behavior and apply the appropriate contact model . (cid:1) DOI : 10 . 1115 / 1 . 2800826 (cid:2) Keywords : adhesive contact , atomic force microscopy , contact mechanics , elasticity , indentation Introduction In the ﬁrst paper of this two - part series on automated analysis of atomic force microscopy (cid:3) AFM (cid:4) indentation data (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) , we pre - sented a comprehensive algorithm for extracting Young’s moduli based on Hertzian contact mechanics . The Hertz theory and its subsequent expansions to include different geometries were used to model the contact between two elastic solids with no surface forces . The Hertzian models do not account for adhesive interac - tions between tip and sample and hence are inadequate in the presence of surface forces . In the context of AFM nanoindenta - tion , the existence of surface forces causes the load - indentation behavior to deviate from the ideal Hertzian relationship . Adhesive contact mechanics theories were pioneered by Johnson et al . (cid:1) 2 (cid:2) (cid:3) Johnson – Kendall – Roberts or JKR theory (cid:4) , who modiﬁed the classical Hertz theory of contact between spherical bodies to account for the inﬂuence of surface energy . An alterna - tive and apparently contradictory theory was formulated by Der - jaguin et al . (cid:1) 3 (cid:2) (cid:3) Derjaguin – Muller – Toporov or DMT theory (cid:4) . The seeming inconsistency was resolved by Tabor (cid:1) 4 (cid:2) , who identiﬁed the applicability of the two theories to opposite extremes of the relationship between adhesive force and sample compliance ; the JKR theory appertains to cases of strong adhesive forces and large tip radii relative to sample compliance , while the DMT theory is appropriate for weak adhesive forces and small tip radii relative to sample compliance (cid:3) a more quantitative explanation can be found in Appendix A (cid:4) . Muller et al . (cid:1) 5 (cid:2) and Greenwood (cid:1) 6 (cid:2) used the Lennard – Jones potential in their numerical analyses of interac - tions in the intermediate regime . Maugis (cid:1) 7 (cid:2) was able to obtain closed - form solutions of the relationship between force , contact radius , and indentation in the intermediate regime by employing a Dugdale potential , which approximates the Lennard – Jones poten - tial by a square well of constant attractive force . The Maugis – Dugdale (cid:3) MD (cid:4) model was made more tractable in application to actual indentation data by Carpick et al . (cid:1) 8 (cid:2) , who developed a general equation relating force and contact radius (cid:3) Carpick – Ogletree – Salmeron or COS equation (cid:4) that closely approximates the MD model .

The COS and PT equations therefore pro - vide the means to effectively employ the MD model to experi - mental data . In this work , we incorporate the PT equation for adhesive con - tact between a rigid spherical indenter and an elastic sample into the automated scheme introduced in the prior paper (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) . The vari - ous theories will ﬁrst be presented , followed by a description of the strategies employed to integrate analysis of adhesive interac - tions into the existing scheme . We devote a portion of the paper to the detailed discussion of salient features of each model with re - spect to force - displacement data ; such information is lacking in the literature but of great importance in applying the theories to experimental data . Values of Young’s moduli are then compared for AFM indentation datasets processed with either the Hertzian model or the MD model . Polyvinyl alcohol (cid:3) PVA (cid:4) gel was se - lected as the model system for our studies on the basis of its reversibility , the ability to modulate its elastic modulus by system - atically varying its composition , and its chemical neutrality . Theory Comparison of Contact Mechanics Models . The original Hertz theory and the aforementioned adhesive theories apply to spherical bodies under contact . The speciﬁc case of the indenta - tion of a compliant surface by a rigid probe allows the relation - ships to be simpliﬁed . These simpliﬁed equations for the Hertz , JKR , DMT , and MD models , including the COS and PT approxi - mations , are presented in Appendix A . The ﬁrst column in Fig . 1 shows schematically the phases of importance in the Hertzian in - dentation process along with the general force - displacement curve at each phase . In the Hertz contact model given by Eqs . (cid:3) A2 (cid:4) and (cid:3) A3 (cid:4) , both indentation depth d and applied force F n are zero at the point of initial contact (cid:3) during tip extension toward the sample surface (cid:4) or the point of separation (cid:3) also called the pull - off point for tip retraction from the sample surface (cid:4) . When adhesive (cid:3) attrac - tive (cid:4) interactions are present , contact occurs under the inﬂuence of such forces . These nonzero interaction forces cause deﬂection of the cantilever toward the sample surface (cid:3) F n (cid:1) 0 in the adopted convention shown in Fig . 1 , where concave bending is positive (cid:4) . Formally , the terms “attractive force” and “adhesive force” are used to differentiate between the external forces during tip exten - sion and tip retraction , respectively (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) . We will dispense with the convention here and refer to both as adhesive forces . The chief difference between the JKR and DMT theories given by Eqs . (cid:3) A4 (cid:4) – (cid:3) A7 (cid:4) and Eqs . (cid:3) A8 (cid:4) – (cid:3) A10 (cid:4) , respectively , is the rela - tion between the contact area and the applied force . In the DMT theory , the contact area becomes zero when the maximum adhe - sive force F ad is balanced by the cantilever restoring force (cid:1) 11 (cid:2) . This occurs at the point of initial contact when the tip approaches the sample and at the pull - off point when the tip is retracted (cid:3) see Fig . 1 , second row from top (cid:4) . In the JKR theory , when F n = − F ad , the contact area is nonzero , resulting in abrupt contact or separa - tion . In fact , the contact area is never zero in the JKR model , as clearly seen in Eq . (cid:3) A5 (cid:4) . Another important distinction between the JKR and DMT theo - ries can be discerned by comparing the indentation relationships given by Eqs . (cid:3) A4 (cid:4) and (cid:3) A8 (cid:4) . In the JKR theory , the indentation at the point of contact or separation is negative , as shown by Eq . (cid:3) A7 (cid:4) (cid:1) 12 (cid:2) . A negative indentation can be interpreted as deforma - tion of the sample surface toward the probe (cid:3) i . e . , opposite in di - rection to the deformation due to Hertzian indentation (cid:4) , as seen in Fig . 1 (cid:3) JKR , second row from top (cid:4) . The JKR theory is therefore suitable for modeling interactions between the tip and a much more compliant sample , in which the adhesive force is strong enough to overcome the sample stiffness and cause the surface to be drawn toward the tip . In the DMT model , the indentation (cid:2) vanishes at the point of contact or separation (cid:3) i . e . , (cid:2) = 0 at contact area a = 0 (cid:4) . Hence , the model represents the other extreme of sample compliance and applies to the indentation of relatively stiff samples . The DMT force - indentation relationship , derived by combining Eqs . (cid:3) A8 (cid:4) – (cid:3) A10 (cid:4) , is essentially the Hertz relationship with the addition of the adhesive force term given by Eq . (cid:3) A10 (cid:4) . We note that the point of zero indentation in the JKR theory corresponds to an applied force of F n = − (cid:3) 8 / 9 (cid:4) F ad , where F ad is the maximum adhesive force obtained by setting (cid:2) = 0 in Eq . (cid:3) A4 (cid:4) , substituting the deﬁnition of the contact area given by Eq . (cid:3) A5 (cid:4) , and solving for F n . Hence , the point of zero indentation occurs after contact (cid:3) during extension (cid:4) or before separation (cid:3) during retraction (cid:4) . The MD theory , represented in its entirety by Eqs . (cid:3) A11 (cid:4) – (cid:3) A17 (cid:4) , spans the intermediate regime between the JKR and DMT models ; some amount of negative indentation is permitted , depending on the compliance of the sample . The model is tedious to apply in practice because the lack of a direct relationship be - tween force and indentation requires numerical iterations for mul - tiple ﬁtting parameters . The empirical COS and PT equations fa - Fig . 1 Schematic of force - displacement behavior as predicted by the Hertzian , DMT , JKR , and MD theories .

The COS equation repre - sents the former relation and is given by Eq . (cid:3) A18 (cid:4) . For typical AFM indentation data , the PT equation given by Eq . (cid:3) A20 (cid:4) may be used . Essential Reference Points in Force - Displacement Curves . The AFM does not allow direct measurements of force and inden - tation depth . Despite the common use of the terms “force - displacement curve” and “force curve , ” AFM nanoindentation data are usually in the form of cantilever deﬂection (cid:3) d (cid:4) as a func - tion of the position of the ﬁxed end or base of the cantilever (cid:3) z (cid:4) . Hence , reference points are necessary to convert the raw values to values of force and indentation . In the ﬁrst paper of this two - part series (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) , methods requiring the identiﬁcation of the contact point were proposed as being more capable than contact point indepen - dent methods of handling diverse types of data . When adhesive interactions are present , reference points become crucial in the proper evaluation of adhesive and elastic behavior contained in the data . Because discussion of this detail is generally lacking in the literature , we describe here the essential reference points re - quired to recast the force - indentation relationships into forms use - ful for analyzing AFM data ; strategies for identifying these points will be presented in the next section . The applied force is directly related to the cantilever deﬂection through the spring constant of the cantilever (cid:3) k c (cid:4) by F n = k c (cid:3) d − d 1 (cid:4) (cid:3) 1 (cid:4) where d 1 is the zero - deﬂection position of the cantilever . From our previous paper (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) , the indentation is deﬁned by (cid:2) = (cid:3) z − z 0 (cid:4) − (cid:3) d − d 0 (cid:4) = (cid:3) z − d (cid:4) − (cid:3) z 0 − d 0 (cid:4) = w − w 0 (cid:3) 2 (cid:4) where the reference point (cid:3) z 0 , d 0 (cid:4) is the point of zero indentation . The transformed variable w = z − d and its value at the reference point w 0 are introduced for simpliﬁcation . Note the distinction between the point of zero external force (cid:3) z 1 , d 1 (cid:4) and the indenta - tion reference point (cid:3) z 0 , d 0 (cid:4) ; the two points are coincident only in Hertzian mechanics . All reference points can be expressed in terms of z or w . In the DMT model , both indentation depth and contact radius are zero at the point of contact (cid:3) z 0 , d 0 (cid:4) and increase with the externally applied load following Eq . (cid:3) A8 (cid:4) . In physical terms , the cantilever is permitted to deﬂect toward the sample surface prior to contact , reaching its maximum negative deﬂection or maximum attractive force at the point of contact (cid:3) see Fig . 2 (cid:4) . At the onset of contact in the JKR and (cid:3) to a lesser extent (cid:4) MD models , the tip and sample surface are instantaneously drawn together , resulting in a nonzero contact radius and negative indentation depth . The con - tact point in the JKR and MD models is denoted by (cid:3) z (cid:1) , d (cid:1) (cid:4) in Fig . 2 . As in the DMT theory , contact occurs at the maximum attrac - tive force F ad . It should be noted that quantitative methods based on adhesive interactions between the indenter tip and the sample have been developed by a number of researchers including Scheffer et al . (cid:1) 13 (cid:2) , Eaton et al . (cid:1) 14 (cid:2) , and Sun et al . (cid:1) 15 (cid:2) . For example , the approach of Sun et al . , based on various adhesion theories , allows for the extraction of E based on contact radii at different depths of indentation . However , the PT equation is the most amenable to automation because its application to AFM indentation data re - quires only the identiﬁcation of the three reference points shown in Fig . 2 (cid:3) b (cid:4) . Cao et al . (cid:1) 16 (cid:2) used a depth - sensing nanoindentation system in their tests of polydimethylsiloxane and applied the JKR model and the PT equation to the ﬁtting of the force - indentation data . Compared to the AFM , depth - sensing systems provide superior load control and displacement accuracy but lack the precise sample positioning and imaging capabilities afforded by the AFM (cid:1) 17 (cid:2) . In the study by Cao and colleagues , the contact point was assumed to be the point of zero indentation . Implicit in the as - sumption is that there is no deformation of the sample toward the tip (cid:3) as in the DMT model (cid:4) and that a contact area arises instanta - neously upon contact between the tip and the sample surface . In our approach , we incorporate methods to treat the contact point and point of zero indentation separately in accordance with the MD theory ; the provision for negative indentations is important for indentation behavior approaching the JKR limit .

An automated routine capable of accurately analyzing AFM indentation data regardless of whether adhesive interactions are present must be able to distinguish between datasets that ex - hibit Hertzian and adhesive behavior . Identifying adhesive contact from force - displacement curves is straightforward because of the pronounced negative deﬂection of the cantilever near the onset of initial contact . The following procedure is utilized to establish the existence of such interactions : 1 . Marching along the dataset , the initial portion (cid:3) noncontact region (cid:4) is ﬁtted with a line while the latter portion is ﬁtted with a power function of the form d = d (cid:3) i (cid:4) + b (cid:3) z − z (cid:3) i (cid:4) (cid:4) 3 / 2 (cid:3) 3 (cid:4) where b is the lone ﬁtting parameter , i is the current itera - tion , and the exponent of 3 / 2 is characteristic of Hertzian indentation with a rigid sphere (cid:1) 18 , 19 (cid:2) . Hence , (cid:3) z (cid:3) i (cid:4) , d (cid:3) i (cid:4) (cid:4) takes on all values between the ﬁrst (cid:3) i = 1 (cid:4) and last points . In the adopted convention , the last point refers to the point of maximum indentation , regardless of whether extension or retraction data are considered . 2 . At each iteration , an aggregate mean - square error (cid:3) MSE (cid:4) is calculated , with the contribution from the nonlinear ﬁt given greater weight to offset the typically low MSE values from the zero - force , noncontact region . In most cases , multiplying the MSE of the nonlinear ﬁt by a factor of 2 is sufﬁcient . However , if the noncontact region comprises a dispropor - tionately large segment of the data , a larger factor (cid:3) e . g . , 10 (cid:4) is necessary to identify the best ﬁt to the contact region . The linear ﬁt associated with the lowest aggregate MSE is used as a preliminary check for the presence of adhesive forces—a negative slope using either factor indicates that such interactions are potentially present . If the slopes using both factors are positive , Hertzian analysis is applied . The (cid:3) z (cid:3) i (cid:4) , d (cid:3) i (cid:4) (cid:4) pair corresponding to the lowest MSE is denoted (cid:3) z * , d * (cid:4) . An example of the two - part ﬁt of a typical retraction curve is shown in Fig . 3 (cid:3) Dataset “a” (cid:4) . 3 . For a negative slope , the global minimum of the d versus z data is found . The position of this point is identiﬁed by its index i = (cid:3) . The minimum value of d is therefore designated by d (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:4) . 4 . The data from i = 1 , 2 , 3 , . . . , (cid:3) is ﬁtted with both a force law based on the Lennard – Jones potential (cid:3) detailed in Appendix B (cid:4) and a linear function . The MSE of each ﬁt is computed . 5 . If adhesive interactions are present , the force law provides a signiﬁcantly better ﬁt of the data than does the linear ﬁt (cid:3) see Example “b” in Fig . 3 (cid:4) . In the absence of adhesive forces , d (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:4) is attributed to intrinsic noise in the data , and the linear function will be the superior ﬁt . In this case , the procedure again reverts to Hertzian analysis . 6 . For adhesive contact , the external force reference d 1 from Eq . (cid:3) 1 (cid:4) is obtained from the Lennard – Jones ﬁt as described in Appendix B . The postcontact force reference point (cid:3) z 1 , d 1 (cid:4) is found by a linear search in the interval bounded by (cid:3) z (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:4) , d (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:4) and the last point . We use (cid:3) z 1 , d 1 (cid:4) to estimate the axial strain (cid:4) zz using the Hertzian mechanics relation (cid:1) 20 (cid:2) (cid:4) zz = 2 (cid:2) 1 / 2 (cid:5) R 1 / 2 (cid:3) 1 − (cid:6) (cid:4) (cid:3) 4 (cid:4) While use of the Hertzian relationship and approximation of the Hertz contact point by (cid:3) z 1 , d 1 (cid:4) introduce errors in the computation , we use this approach to merely establish a rough threshold for linear stress - strain behavior . Some prior knowledge of the sample mechanical properties is beneﬁcial since the linear regime is ma - terial dependent . Based on the speciﬁed strain limit , the portion of the data exceeding the threshold is excluded from the analysis . In tip retraction , the minimum cannot simply be regarded as the pull - off point since multiple release points can arise due to events such as the unfolding of large molecules adsorbed to the tip and sample surfaces or the unbinding of multiple receptor - ligand pairs , leading to a “sawtooth” pattern in the d versus z curve (cid:1) 21 (cid:2) . In such cases , the MD theory is applicable from the initial release point (cid:3) z (cid:1) , d (cid:1) (cid:4) , as indicated in the typical example shown in Fig . 3 (cid:3) Dataset “c” (cid:4) . This point may be difﬁcult to locate accurately due to signal noise , but is generally in the vicinity of (cid:3) z * , d * (cid:4) . Within the interval bounded by (cid:3) z * , d * (cid:4) and (cid:3) z 1 , d 1 (cid:4) , the point correspond - ing to the smallest value of d , or the largest adhesive force , is taken to be the pull - off point (cid:3) z (cid:1) , d (cid:1) (cid:4) . Once the reference points (cid:3) z (cid:1) , d (cid:1) (cid:4) and (cid:3) z 1 , d 1 (cid:4) from Fig . 2 (cid:3) b (cid:4) have been identiﬁed , the adhe - sive force can be calculated using Eq . (cid:3) 1 (cid:4) to be F ad = − k c (cid:3) d 1 − d (cid:1) (cid:4) and compared to the maximum applied force F max to deter - mine whether the adhesive component can be neglected . Using the guideline set by Johnson and Greenwood (cid:1) 22 (cid:2) , for (cid:5) F ad / F max (cid:5) (cid:1) 0 . 05 , Hertzian analysis is invoked . Unlike (cid:3) z (cid:1) , d (cid:1) (cid:4) and (cid:3) z 1 , d 1 (cid:4) , the location of the indentation ref - erence point (cid:3) z 0 , d 0 (cid:4) is not readily established from conspicuous features of the force curve except in the limiting cases—it is con - gruent with the point of contact or separation in the DMT theory and corresponds to the point at which the applied force is equal to − (cid:3) 8 / 9 (cid:4) F ad in the JKR theory .

(cid:3) A20 (cid:4) to zero and manipulating to yield (cid:6) F n F ad (cid:6) (cid:2) = 0 = (cid:3) F n / F ad (cid:4) 0 = (cid:1)(cid:3) 1 + (cid:7) (cid:4) S 3 / (cid:3) 4−2 (cid:8) (cid:4) − (cid:7) (cid:2) 2 − 1 (cid:3) 5 (cid:4) where S and (cid:8) are deﬁned by Eqs . (cid:3) A24 (cid:4) and (cid:3) A25 (cid:4) , respectively . It can be veriﬁed that the ratio (cid:3) F n / F ad (cid:4) 0 is exactly −1 for the DMT case (cid:3) (cid:7) = 0 (cid:4) and reaches a maximum value of −0 . 86 at (cid:7) (cid:7) 0 . 27 before decreasing to −8 / 9 for the JKR case (cid:3) (cid:7) = 1 (cid:4) . Our strategy for ﬁnding (cid:3) z 0 , d 0 (cid:4) is to iteratively search for the value of (cid:7) that yields the best ﬁt of the data to Eq . (cid:3) A20 (cid:4) . In the interest of minimizing computation expense , it is important to consider the means by which the goodness of ﬁt or MSE at each iteration is evaluated . The PT equation given by Eq . (cid:3) A20 (cid:4) , when expressed in the AFM - speciﬁc form by substituting Eq . (cid:3) 2 (cid:4) for (cid:2) and Eq . (cid:3) 1 (cid:4) for F n , essentially casts z as a function of d . Hence , it is advantageous to reverse the roles of z and d as the independent and measured quantities , respectively , and use the measured val - ues of d to calculate ﬁtted values of z : z = z 0 + d − d 0 + a 0 (cid:3) (cid:7) (cid:4) 2 R (cid:8) (cid:9) (cid:7) + (cid:10) 1 + k c (cid:3) d − d 1 (cid:4) / F ad 1 + (cid:7) (cid:11) 4 / 3 − S (cid:9) (cid:7) + (cid:10) 1 + k c (cid:3) d − d 1 (cid:4) / F ad 1 + (cid:7) (cid:11) 2 / 3 (cid:8) (cid:12) (cid:3) 6 (cid:4) The most direct approach to the data - ﬁtting problem is to de - termine the values of (cid:3) F n / F ad (cid:4) 0 , d 0 , z 0 , and a 0 at each iteration of (cid:7) by making use of known relations at the reference points . Note that the quantities (cid:3) F n / F ad (cid:4) 0 , (cid:7) , and d 0 are related through Eqs . (cid:3) 1 (cid:4) and (cid:3) 5 (cid:4) , while Eq . (cid:3) A20 (cid:4) can be evaluated at F n = − F ad and at F n = 0 to provide two additional equations for the two remaining unknowns z 0 and a 0 . We reject this approach because it attempts to ﬁt the data at only the three reference points rather than con - sidering the complete dataset . There are two remaining ap - proaches to generate the values of (cid:3) F n / F ad (cid:4) 0 , (cid:7) , and d 0 : a . Each successive point (cid:3) w (cid:3) i (cid:4) , d (cid:3) i (cid:4) (cid:4) is assumed to be the in - dentation reference point . Equation (cid:3) 1 (cid:4) is then used to calculate (cid:3) F n / F ad (cid:4) 0 , which allows substitution of Eqs . (cid:3) A24 (cid:4) and (cid:3) A25 (cid:4) into Eq . (cid:3) 5 (cid:4) to generate the correspond - ing value of (cid:7) and leaves a 0 as the lone ﬁtting parameter in Eq . (cid:3) 6 (cid:4) . Although this approach decreases complexity and computation time by eliminating z 0 as a ﬁtting pa - rameter , it is susceptible to large errors due to the low signal - to - noise ratios common in the vicinity of the contact / separation point (cid:3) see sample Dataset “b” in Fig . 3 (cid:4) . b . The preferred method is to iteratively increment the value of (cid:7) from 0 to 1 (cid:3) we use a step size of 0 . 01 (cid:4) . Equation (cid:3) 5 (cid:4) is applied at each iteration to calculate (cid:3) F n / F ad (cid:4) 0 and Eq . (cid:3) 1 (cid:4) is then used to ﬁnd d 0 . Regression analysis is per - formed to determine values of the parameters z 0 and a 0 in Eq . (cid:3) 6 (cid:4) . Once the optimal location of (cid:3) z 0 , d 0 (cid:4) is found , Eq . (cid:3) A22 (cid:4) is used to calculate the quantity a¯ 0 and the ﬁtting parameter a 02 / R yields the value of a 0 . To determine the interfacial energy , Eq . (cid:3) A23 (cid:4) is used to ﬁnd F¯ ad , which is then substituted with F ad into Eq . (cid:3) A16 (cid:4) to calculate (cid:9) . The elastic constant of the indented material K is then obtained from Eq . (cid:3) A15 (cid:4) . With K known , Young’s modulus is calculated using Eq . (cid:3) A1 (cid:4) . The complete algorithm described in this section is represented by the ﬂowchart in Fig . 4 . Materials and Methods The experimental details were described in our prior paper (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) . Testing of tissue - engineered cartilage will not be discussed here because no adhesive interactions were observed in the indentation of those samples . Brieﬂy , PVA gel was cast into ﬁlms (cid:3) for AFM probing (cid:4) or cylinders (cid:3) for macroscopic compression testing (cid:4) by varying the polymer content at constant cross - link density . The gels were cross - linked with glutaraldehyde at pH (cid:13) 1 . 5 , with an appropriate amount of cross - linker to ensure that all polymer chains were attached to a continuous network structure . All samples were fully swollen in water prior to testing . A Texture Analyser bench top materials testing system (cid:3) Stable Micro Systems , Surrey , UK (cid:4) was used to perform dislacement - controlled compression of the gel cylinders (cid:3) ramp speed of 1 mm / s or strain rate of 0 . 1 / s until a preset load is achieved (cid:4) . Measurements were made at constant volume , with no detectable barreling . For all samples (cid:3) at least three of each concentration (cid:4) , the shear modulus was determined from rubber elasticity theory (cid:1) 1 , 23 , 24 (cid:2) . Nanoindentation of samples was performed using a commercial AFM (cid:3) Bioscope I with a Nanoscope IIIA controller , Veeco Instru - ments , Santa Barbara , CA (cid:4) seated atop an inverted optical micro - scope . General purpose , oxide - sharpened silicon nitride tips were modiﬁed by gluing either a 9 . 6 (cid:10) m diameter polystyrene bead or a 5 . 5 (cid:10) m diameter glass bead near the tip . Multiple force curves for each PVA ﬁlm were collected using the “force - volume” mode Fig . 4 Flowchart representing the comprehensive algorithm for processing AFM indentation data .

Each complete dataset consisted of 256 (cid:3) 16 (cid:11) 16 raster scan (cid:4) or 1024 (cid:3) 32 (cid:11) 32 raster scan (cid:4) sets of extension - retraction curves . Software developed in MATLAB (cid:3) Mathworks , Natick , MA (cid:4) and based on the algorithms described here and in the previous paper was used to automati - cally extract values of Young’s modulus in extension and retrac - tion . In all analyses , the data beyond an axial strain of roughly 20 – 25 % were discarded . Results and Discussion Young’s moduli from macroscopic compression and AFM ex - tension data were presented previously (cid:1) 1 (cid:2) and are reproduced in Table 1 as well as in Fig . 5 . For small adhesive force relative to indentation depth and applied force , the adhesive effects can be considered negligible and the indentation can be attributed solely to the externally applied load . This appeared to be the case in the extension curves , where attractive interactions were undetectably small and allowed all such data to be analyzed using Hertzian analysis . Data for retraction curves are also presented in Table 1 and Fig . 5 . Regardless of whether the Hertzian or MD theory was applied in analyzing the retraction data , the agreement between the average extracted values of E in extension and retraction were generally good . The largest difference was found in the 9 % gels , where the average modulus in retraction was 12 . 6 % smaller than the extension value . Average Young’s moduli also compared fa - vorably with the macroscopic results . The differences when com - paring E in extension and retraction within an individual set of curves ranged from an average of 10 . 2 % to 16 . 2 % . This was ex - pected as a consequence of the varying degrees of hysteresis present in each set of extension - retraction curves and is indepen - dent of the existence of adhesive effects . The statistical signiﬁ - cance of the difference between extension and retraction data was evaluated using paired t tests , with the results reported in Table 1 . Based on the results , there was signiﬁcant difference between ex - tension and retraction data in all the samples , indicating that hys - teresis affects the mechanics of tip retraction regardless of the presence of adhesion . Although it may appear that analysis of retraction data serves mainly as a means of obtaining a quantita - tive measure of the level of hysteresis , it may be necessary in cases where the extension curve is intractable due to high levels of noise . In the analysis of indentation data , strains were limited to ap - proximately 20 – 25 % . As reported in the previous paper , we found that when points representing axial strains close to 50 % were included in the analysis , some strain hardening as indicated by increases in extracted Young’s moduli and the residuals resulted . It is important to point out that the adhesive theories , which have their basis on the Hertz theory , are predicated on the assumption of linear stress - strain behavior . Regardless of the existence of sig - niﬁcance adhesion , it is advisable to establish an estimate of the linear strain limit by performing preliminary indentations to dif - ferent depths and establishing a base line of cantilever deﬂection . This can prevent unnecessary truncation of data to exclude non - linear points that deviate from linear behavior . Note that since the samples were made from the same batch , the variability in adhesive interactions from sample to sample was likely due to differences in the surface properties of the tips . The absence of signiﬁcant adhesion in the 3 % and 9 % gels suggests that the polymer concentration does not affect the adhesion prop - erties . With the choice of neutral PVA as the model system , we sought to eliminate excessive adhesion in order to ensure com - plete release of the tip following each indentation . The limited range in vertical travel z of the AFM used in the study , coupled with cantilevers of low bending stiffness , introduced the possibil - ity of the tip being adhered to the sample even at maximum re - traction . When probing samples that exhibit adhesive behavior , it is therefore important to verify the existence of noncontact re - gions in both extension and retraction force curves . The degree of accuracy in applying the PT equation to AFM indentation data then becomes largely a function of correctly identifying the refer - ence points shown in Fig . 2 .

Some sample ﬁts of retraction curves with the PT equation are shown in Fig . 6 . The dimensionless parameter (cid:7) in the PT equation represents the extent to which the adhesive interactions approach those pre - dicted by the JKR (cid:3) (cid:7) = 1 (cid:4) and DMT (cid:3) (cid:7) = 0 (cid:4) theories . It is also valuable as a secondary check of the accuracy of the PT equation in modeling the indentation mechanics . For stiff materials and low interfacial energies , (cid:7) is expected to approach the DMT limit of 0 while soft materials with a propensity to deform toward the tip yield values of (cid:7) that approach unity . These features are borne out in the indentation of the PVA gels , with (cid:7) (cid:13) 0 . 05 for the stiffest gels (cid:3) 12 % polymer content (cid:4) and (cid:7) (cid:13) 0 . 18 for the more compliant gels (cid:3) 6 % polymer content (cid:4) . Conclusions We have successfully incorporated adhesive contact mechanics into the automated procedure we ﬁrst introduced for Hertzian analysis of AFM data from the indentation of soft , chemically cross - linked gels . The PT approximation of the MD theory has been shown to be readily adaptable to the automation algorithm . The accuracy of the PT equation was demonstrated by the excel - lent agreement between the results from macroscopic compression and nanoindentation of PVA gels . The comprehensive scheme is capable of automatically detecting the presence of adhesive inter - actions and applying the appropriate contact mechanics model to the processing of AFM datasets . This capability should prove to be a valuable tool for the high - throughput processing of large collections of AFM datasets and may be particularly important in the probing of highly inhomogeneous materials .

Appendix B : Fitting of Noncontact Data With the Lennard – Jones Potential In AFM indentation data representing the attraction between a spherical probe and a ﬂat surface , the portion of the data prior to initial contact or immediately following separation is oftentimes assumed to be governed by a force law similar to the Lennard – Jones (cid:3) LJ (cid:4) potential (cid:1) 22 (cid:2) . Formally , the LJ function governing the interaction between two rigid spheres is of the form V (cid:3) r (cid:4) = 4 (cid:16) (cid:9) (cid:14) D r (cid:15) 12 − (cid:14) D r (cid:15) 6 (cid:11) (cid:3) B1 (cid:4) where V is the potential , r is the separation distance , (cid:16) is the well depth , and D is the diameter of the spheres . Note that attractive forces are represented by negative potentials and that repulsive forces become dominant as the separation distance approaches zero . The latter feature of the LJ potential is ignored in the ﬁtting of indentation data . Abandoning the formal representations , d is substituted for the potential V , and 4 (cid:16) and D are replaced by generalized constants A and B , respectively . It is necessary to transform the AFM data (cid:3) d versus w (cid:4) to the numerical form required by Eq . (cid:3) B1 (cid:4) . First , because increasing w corresponds to decreasing separation , the separation can be ex - pressed nondimensionally by r = 1 + Cw (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:4) − w w (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:3) B2 (cid:4) where C is a scale factor that controls the rate at which the po - tential drops to its minimum value and (cid:3) refers to the point at which d is a minimum . Note that the separation at maximum attractive force has been set to unity for simplicity . A second transformation is performed to force d to conform to the behavior dictated by the LJ potential (cid:3) i . e . , at large separation , the potential is essentially zero (cid:4) .

Equa - tion (cid:3) B3 (cid:4) is then be solved for A at the minimum d (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:4) , to yield A = −4 (cid:3) d (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:4) − d ref (cid:4) . We iteratively ﬁt Eq . (cid:3) B3 (cid:4) to subsets of data points from (cid:3) w (cid:3) i (cid:4) , d (cid:3) i (cid:4) (cid:4) to (cid:3) w (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:4) , d (cid:3) (cid:3) (cid:4) (cid:4) , where i is increased from 1 to (cid:3) and the scale factor C is the sole ﬁtting parameter . Points prior to (cid:3) w (cid:3) i (cid:4) , d (cid:3) i (cid:4) (cid:4) are ﬁt to the line d = d (cid:3) i (cid:4) . The value of d (cid:3) i (cid:4) corresponding to the best least - squares ﬁt of the data is the zero - force reference d 1 in Eq . (cid:3) 1 (cid:4) .
