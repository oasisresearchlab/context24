However , achievement of good transfection levels requires the use of a gene vector . For in vivo applications , synthetic vectors are an interesting option to avoid possible issues associated with viral vectors ( safety , production costs , etc . ) . Herein , we report on the design of tri - partite polyionic complex micelles as original non - viral polymeric vectors suited for mesenchymal stem cell transfection with siRNA . Three micelle formulations were designed to exhibit pH - triggered disassem - bly in an acidic pH range comparable to that of endosomes . One formulation was selected as the most promising with the highest siRNA loading capacity while clearly maintaining pH - triggered disassembly properties . A thorough investigation of the internalization pathway of micelles into cells with tagged siRNA was made before showing an e ﬃ cient inhibition of Runx2 expression in primary bone marrow - derived stem cells . This work evidenced PIC micelles as promising synthetic vectors that allow e ﬃ cient MSC transfection and control over their behavior , from the perspective of their clinical use . 1 . Introduction Mesenchymal Stem Cells ( MSC ) have emerged as a strong option for regenerative medicine in the field of tissue engin - eering . Indeed , on account of ( i ) the established isolation pro - tocol from various tissues , ( ii ) their amplification ability in vitro , ( iii ) their ability to di ﬀ erentiate toward various cell phenotypes under appropriate conditions 1 and ( iv ) their secretory activity , MSC has become a choice candidate for clinical appli - cations . 2 Recently , this cell - based approach has been associated with gene therapy strategies using RNA interference 3 , 4 to acceler - ate , enhance or even direct MSC di ﬀ erentiation . 5 – 7 The limited ability of nucleic acids ( NAs ) to cross cellular membranes , largely due to their hydrophilicity and negative charge , along with a high susceptibility to extracellular nucleases , calls for e ﬃ cient gene delivery vectors . However , routinely used physical in vitro gene transfer methods , such as electroporation , often turned out to be ine ﬃ cient to transfect nucleic acids ( NAs ) in MSC . 8 To date , viral vectors still rep - resent the most e ﬃ cient option for cell transduction in vitro . 9 , 10 Nevertheless , some drawbacks highly modulate their interest and feasibility in the clinic , notably safety con - cerns 11 and high production costs . For these reasons , attention has turned to non - viral vectors , 12 although they tend to exhibit lower transfection e ﬃ ciency than their viral counterparts , especially for MSC . 13 Synthetic vectors are indeed more versa - tile because they can be easily chemically modified , and they present less pathogenicity and low production costs . A large number of commercial lipidic non - viral vectors have been developed and used for in vitro studies . 14 , 15 Lipofectamine 2000® generally yields the highest e ﬃ ciency as compared with its competitors but contrasting results have been reported in the literature depending on the cells or the protocol used ( e . g . 98 % 14 to 20 % 16 GFP knockdown e ﬃ ciency in human MSC ) . This highlights the variable e ﬃ ciency of this kind of vector in MSC , which is often associated with a relatively high cyto - toxicity . 17 Besides , most of the usual synthetic vectors ( poly - ethylenimine ( PEI ) , 18 poly - L - lysine ( PLL ) , 19 poly ( lactic - co - glyco - lic acid ) ( PLGA ) ) 20 exhibited plasmid DNA transfection rates with hMSC often below 20 % , which is insu ﬃ cient for clinical † Electronic supplementary information ( ESI ) available .

More elaborate vectors , based for instance on multi - func - tional carriers , were then developed with the aim to circum - vent these drawbacks and cross the barriers encountered by vectors both in vitro and in vivo . 21 Indeed , some interesting recent results described novel designs of RNAi moiety vectors , although cytotoxicity remains a concern with respect to trans - fection e ﬃ ciency . 22 – 28 Based on encouraging previous results on the transfection of dendritic cells , 29 we chose to develop tripartite polyionic complex ( PIC ) micelles as an original non - viral polymeric vector suited for MSC transfection of siRNA . These PIC micelles were designed to exhibit pH - triggered disassembly and endosomal escape ability , as this last point is a well - known hurdle to an e ﬃ cient transfection . The formation of PIC micelles is based on the spontaneous association of a double - hydrophilic block copolymer ( DHBC ) with a cationic homopolymer ( Fig . 1 ) . The polyanionic block of the DHBC forms an electrostatic complex with the polycation , resulting in a liquid precipitate called “ coacervate ” . 30 , 31 Micelles are stabilized by a shell , or a corona , formed by the neutral block ( typically polyethylene oxide – PEO ) of the DHBC . Consequently , siRNA can be associated with the core of micelles by complexation with the cationic polymer . Interestingly , when formulated with weak polyacids or poly - bases , micelles can exhibit pH - sensitivity and reversible assem - bly / disassembly . 32 With polymethacrylate acid ( PMAA ) as the polyacidic block , which exhibits a p K a of approx . 6 . 5 , micelles are expected to disassemble at the acidic pH of the endo - somes 33 and release their siRNA load . In addition , confor - mational changes of PMAA occurring in the same pH range should favor the endosomal escape of the siRNA towards the cytoplasm , owing to membrane destabilization properties . 34 In the present study , we investigated the influence of the size of DHBC blocks and of the counter - cation nature ( PLL or PEI ) on micelle formation and properties . We studied the ability of the di ﬀ erent formulations to stably incorporate siRNA and to disassemble at acidic pH . Then , we evaluated the interactions of candidate micelle vectors with murine MSC ( mMSC ) in terms of cytotoxicity , endocytosis rate and tra ﬃ ck - ing pathways ( due to the tracking of a fluorescently labelled siRNA by flow cytometry ) . We finally assessed their ability to deliver a siRNA targeting Runx2 ( a runt - related transcription Fig . 1 Schematic of the micelles ’ composition and spontaneous association . DHBC : double hydrophilic block copolymers , PEO - b - PMAA : poly ( ethylene oxide ) - b - polymethacrylic acid , bPEI : branched polyethylenimine , PLL : poly - L - lysine , and siRNA : small interfering RNA . Electrostatic inter - actions arise between the negative charges ( anionic block of PMAA and phosphate groups of siRNA ) and the positive charges of the polycation ( primary and secondary amines ) . The comparison between each type of micelle is made either on the neutral block length or on the type of cationic polymer ( linear or branched , with di ﬀ erent classes of amines ) .

Chemical and biochemical reactants TAMRA - tagged siRNA ( siRNA - TAMRA ) targeting eGFP ( sense 5 ′ - TAM [ GGCUACGUCCAGGAGCGCA ] ) and control siRNA ( CTL ) ( sense 5 ′ - UAAGGCUAUGAAGAGAUAC ) were obtained from Eurofins Genomic ( Ebersberg , Germany ) . siRNA targeting mouse Runx2 ( siGENOME , mix of 4 target sequences : ACAGAGGGCACAAGUUCUA , CGAAAUGCCUCCGCUGUUA , CAAGAAG GCUCUGGCGUUU and CCAUAACAGUCUUCACAAA ) was obtained from Dharmacon ( France ) . Poly - L - lysine ( PLL ) hydrobromide ( 21 000 g mol − 1 ) was obtained from Alamanda Polymers ( Huntsville , USA ) , and the branched polyethyl - enimine ( PEI ) ( 700 g mol − 1 ) was obtained from Sigma ( France ) . Polyethyleneoxide ( 5000 g mol − 1 ) - polymethacrylic acid ( 1300 g mol − 1 ) ( PEO 5000 - PMAA 1300 , C1 ) copolymer and PEO 3000 - PMAA 1200 copolymer ( C2 ) were obtained from Polymer Source ( Dorval , Canada ) . Water was purified using a MilliQ - purification system ( Millipore , France ) . MTT ( 3 - [ 4 , 5 - dimethyl - thiazol - 2 - yl ] - 2 , 5 - diphenyltetrazolium bromide ; thiazolyl blue ) , methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( M β CD ) , genistein , chlorpromazine and cytochalasin D were obtained from Sigma Aldrich ( France ) . 2 . 2 . Micelles formulation Micelles were prepared following the general protocol pre - viously described by our laboratory . 35 For physico - chemical study , micelles were prepared in purified water , whereas for biological use they were prepared in sterile phosphate bu ﬀ er saline ( PBS ) . An aqueous solution of the polycation ( PLL or PEI ) was prepared at a charge concentration of 4 . 39 × 10 − 6 mol L − 1 ( corresponding to 0 . 92 mg mL − 1 of PLL and 0 . 5 mg mL − 1 of PEI ) . siRNA was added at the desired concentration ( 0 . 5 , 0 . 75 , 1 , 1 . 5 , 2 or 3 µM ) to form the initial complex , and this inter - mediate mix ( solution 1 ) was incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature . Micelles were then obtained by mixing this solution 1 with the same volume of solution 2 containing the polyanionic copolymer of PEO - PMAA . To obtain a charge ratio of 1 ( R = amine / acrylic acid = [ NH 2 + ] / [ AA − ] = 1 ) , solution 2 was prepared at the appropriate concentration ( 1 . 8 mg mL − 1 for PEO 5000 - PMAA 1300 or 1 . 3 mg mL − 1 for PEO 3000 - PMAA 1200 ) . When formulated in water , the pH was adjusted to 7 . 4 using 0 . 05 M NaOH . The final mixture was then stirred at room temperature for 1 hour . Micelle formulations were designated as M1 = PEO 5000 - PMAA 1300 / PLL 21000 ; M2 = PEO 3000 - PMAA 1200 / PLL 21000 and M3 = PEO 3000 - PMAA 1200 / bPEI 700 . Samples were stored at 4 °C prior to use . 2 . 3 . Micelle characterization 2 . 3 . 1 . Dynamic light scattering . Dynamic light scattering measurements ( NanoZS , Malvern Instruments , UK ) were per - formed with a He – Ne laser ( wavelength : 632 . 8 nm ) , at a temp - erature of 25 °C and a scattering angle of 173° for detection . The CONTIN method was utilized for data analysis . Hydrodynamic diameters ( nm ) were measured in water and in PBS , while zeta potentials ( mV ) were measured only in water by laser Doppler electrophoresis . Polydispersity Index ( PdI ) , relative to the width of the population size dispersion , was also measured . The stability of the micelles after dilution in optiMEM , as well as pH - triggered disassembly of micelles in RNAse free acidic water , was assessed by measuring the hydro - dynamic diameter and scattered light intensity expressed as the Derived Count Rate ( DCR , expressed in “ kcts ” for kilo - counts per second ) . DCR is the raw intensity of light scattered by micelles in suspension , irrespective of the attenuator used . To assess their pH - sensitivity , micelles were prepared as indi - cated above , their formation assessed by DLS , and one given formulation was then split into seven test samples . Each sample was adjusted to a specific pH , ranging from 4 . 5 to 8 , stirred for 2 hours , and then measured again with the NanoZS . 2 . 3 . 2 . Encapsulation e ﬃ ciency Qualitative evaluation by electrophoresis . 15 µl of free siRNA solution or siRNA - loaded micelles formulated in PBS with increasing concentrations of siRNA - TAMRA ( ranging from 0 . 5 to 3 µM ) were loaded in a 1 % ( w / v ) agarose gel . Electrophoresis was carried out at a constant voltage ( 100 V ) for 30 min in Tris - borate EDTA ( TBE ) bu ﬀ er . Gels were then imaged using a Typhoon FLA 9500 ( GE Healthcare ) with an excitation wave - length of 532 nm for TAMRA , and a spatial resolution of 50 µm . Analysis of relative band fluorescence intensities was made using ImageJ . 36 Quantitative determination by TAMRA fluorescence titration . A spectrofluorophotometer RF - 5301PC ( Shimadzu ) was used to perform TAMRA fluorescence measurements with an excitation wavelength of 540 nm ( slit width : 5 . 0 nm ) and emission wave - length of 580 nm ( slit width : 3 . 0 nm ) , in a 300 µL - containing quartz cell . The fluorescence of working standard solutions of siRNA - TAMRA , diluted or complexed into micelles in PBS at concentrations of 0 . 5 , 1 . 5 and 3 µM , was determined . DLS measurements were also performed to assess micelle for - mation . Then , 300 µL of each solution were put into ultrafiltra - tion devices ( Vivaspin® 500 µL tubes from Sartorius ( Stedim , France ) containing a tangential filtration unit with a 100 000 g mol − 1 molecular weight cut o ﬀ ) and centrifugation was per - formed at 13 000 g for 10 min at 4 °C to separate micelles ( retentates ) from uncomplexed siRNA in solution ( filtrate ) . It should be noted that , because reverse spinning was not poss - ible with the Vivaspin® tubes and due to possible losses on the membrane surface , encapsulation e ﬃ ciencies were deter - mined indirectly from siRNA quantities present in the filtrates . For this purpose , the volume of the filtrate was measured and DLS and TAMRA fluorescence measurements were performed without further preparation . 2 . 4 .

View Article Online ( 100× ) and penicillin – streptomycin ( PS , 10 000 U mL − 1 ) were also supplied by Life Technologies . Mesenchymal stem cells ( designated as mMSC Bl6 - GFP ) were isolated by flushing the bone marrow of femurs from C57BL / 6 - GFP transgenic mice . Transgenic mice ( C57Bl / 6 ) express an “ enhanced green fluo - rescent protein ” ( EGFP ) under the control of the chicken actin promoter and a CMV enhancer ( Jackson Laboratory , Charles River L ’ Arbresle , France ) . Cell suspension was maintained in complete DMEM ( supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 1 % glutamine and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin , equivalent to final concentrations of 2 nM for glutamine , 100 U mL − 1 for penicillin and 100 µg mL − 1 for streptomycin ) at 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 , and 100 % humidity until obtention of a homogeneous population of cells expressing MSC markers . Cells were charac - terized by their phenotype ( expression of CD44 , Sca - 1 and lack of hematopoietic markers CD11b , CD14 , CD45 , see Fig . S1A † ) and their ability to di ﬀ erentiate into osteoblasts expressing Runx2 , AP and OC ( Fig . S1B † ) and adipocytes expressing PPAR γ , LPL , and FABP4 ( Fig . S1C † ) . The cells were used between passages 16 and 36 . 2 . 5 . Cytotoxicity 5000 cells per 150 µL per well were incubated in a 96 - well assay plate with either each separate component of the micelles ( PEO 5000 - PMAA 1300 , PEO 3000 - PMAA 1200 , and PLL ) or formulated blank micelles ( M1 and M2 ) at di ﬀ erent dilutions ( 1 / 5 , 1 / 10 , 1 / 20 and 1 / 30 ) in complete DMEM ( see the corres - ponding polymer concentrations in Fig . 6A ) . Lipofectamine® was used , as recommended by the manufacturer , at 0 . 5 µL per well , corresponding to a concentration of 3 . 3 µg mL − 1 . A CellTiter 96® AQ ueous Non - Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay , obtained from Promega ( USA ) , was used to evaluate the cell viability following the manufacturer ’ s instructions . Absorbance was measured at 490 nm after 48 h of incubation , and the background corresponding to wells free of cells ( mean of 3 ) was subtracted from each triplicate mean . 2 . 6 . Flow cytometry analysis The cytotoxicity of chemical inhibitors was evaluated by an MTT assay ( following the manufacturer ’ s instructions ) . The threshold was set at a minimum of 80 % cell survival . Then , 150 000 cells were seeded in a 96 - well assay plate and allowed to adhere for 24 h . The medium was then replaced by fresh optiMEM containing either 500 µg mL − 1 of methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( M β CD ) , 54 µg mL − 1 of genistein , 10 µg mL − 1 of chlorpromazine or 10 µg mL − 1 of cytochalasin D . After 2 hours , this pre - incubation medium was replaced by a micelle suspension at 1 . 5 µM of siRNA ( 167 µL , corresponding to 250 pmol of siRNA per well ) and chemical inhibitors ( at the same concentrations as that for pre - incubation ) . After 4 hours of incubation at 37 °C , 5 % CO 2 in a humidified atmosphere , the cells were trypsinized after being washed twice with Hank ’ s Balanced Salt Solution without Ca 2 + ( HBSS , Life Technologies ) . Trypsin was neutralized in complete DMEM and the cells were washed twice again by centrifugation at 1800 rpm , 4 °C , for 5 min and re - suspended in cold HBSS cycles in Eppendorf microcentrifuge tubes . Finally , the cells were centrifuged at 4 °C , 1800 rpm for 5 min and re - suspended in a fixation solution ( 0 . 02 % azide and 2 % formaldehyde in HBSS ) . The samples were analyzed with a BD LSRFortessa ™ flow cyto - meter equipped with a 561 nm laser for TAMRA excitation . For quantification , 20 000 events per sample were collected . WinMDI software was used for analysis . Living cells were gated as a function of their size and granularity . The control groups were performed as cells alone , cells in contact with micelles but without any inhibitor ( 100 % ) , and cells incubated at 4 °C in contact with micelles ( 0 % ) to discriminate between adsorp - tion and energy - dependent mechanisms . 2 . 7 . Confocal laser scanning microscopy 30 000 cells per well were allowed to adhere to glass coverslips at the bottom of a 24 - well Ultra Low Attachment ( ULA ) assay plate , reaching 70 % confluence after 24 hours . The complete medium was then replaced by fresh medium and the cells were treated with 50 pmol of siRNA , corresponding to 35 µL of micelles formulated at 1 . 5 µM in siRNA per well . The cells were treated with naked siRNA ( no gene vector ) as the negative control and siRNA vectorized with Lipofectamine 2000® ( in accordance with the manufacturer ’ s instructions ) as a com - mercial standard . After 1 h and 4 h of treatment , the cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated for 10 minutes in a fixation solution at room temperature ( 0 . 02 % azide and 2 % formaldehyde in Hanks ’ Balanced Salt Solution with no calcium and no magnesium ) , protected from light . Coverslips covered with the attached cells were mounted on microscope slides with ProLong® Gold Antifade Mountant and nuclei were counter - stained with DAPI . Slides were allowed to dry overnight protected from light at room temperature . Internalization of siRNA - TAMRA was visualized on a Leica SP5 microscope equipped with a 63× 1 . 4 NA oil immersion objective lens . Imaging was performed using a sequential acquisition of separated fluorescence signals : TAMRA - labeled siRNA was excited with a 548 nm laser and emission light was collected using a 563 to 632 nm band pass filter , GFP was excited with a 488 nm laser and emission light was collected using a 496 to 534 nm band pass filter , and DAPI was excited using UV light of 405 nm and emission light was collected from 415 to 435 nm . 3 line averages were used to reduce the noise . Stacks of 0 . 18 µm width were used in the z - axis ( for a global height of between 4 and 5 µm ) . 2 . 8 . Inhibition of gene expression 30 000 cells were plated in each well of a 24 - well assay plate , reaching 70 % confluence after 24 hours . Blank micelles were formulated , as well as micelles with 1 . 5 µM of Runx2 - targeting siRNA or siCTL . Complete medium was subsequently replaced by fresh optiMEM medium and the cells were treated with 50 pmol of siRNA per well ( 35 µL of micelle formulation repre - senting 0 . 12 mg mL − 1 of copolymer and 0 . 08 mg mL − 1 of PLL , added to 350 µL of medium ; dilution rate : 1 / 11 ) .

After 6 hours , 650 µL of DMEM supplemented with 15 % of FBS , 1 . 5 % of glutamine and 1 . 5 % of PS were added to reach a final concen - tration of 10 % FBS , and the cells were incubated again for 48 hours . The same experiment was realized in the presence of chloro - quine to evaluate the endosomal escape ability of micelles . The same conditions were applied ( 30 000 cells in a 24 - well assay plate ) , except that the cells were previously incubated with 100 µM of chloroquine in optiMEM for 2 hours before treatment . After this pre - treatment , the medium was replaced by a mixture of chloroquine at 100 µM and a volume of micelle suspension corresponding to 50 pmol of siRNA ( 35 µL ) per well , in a total volume of 500 µL of optiMEM . After 4 hours , the medium was replaced by complete DMEM and the cells were incubated again for 48 hours . 2 . 9 . RNA extraction , reverse transcription and real - time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( RT - qPCR ) Total RNA was isolated using a RNeasy mini kit ( Qiagen , France ) and reverse - transcribed using dNTP mix ( 0 . 5 mM , Fermentas ) , Random Hexamer ( RH ) primer ( 2 . 5 µM , Fermentas ) , DTT 10 mM , 1× bu ﬀ er and M - MLV reverse tran - scriptase ( 5 U µL − 1 , Invitrogen ) . Reverse transcription ( RT ) was performed with a first cycle at 65 °C for 5 minutes and then at 4 °C for 5 minutes for an intermediate mix containing 200 pmol of ARN and indicated concentrations of dNTP and RH . Then , DTT , bu ﬀ er and reverse transcriptase were added at the indicated concentrations , and the mix was subjected to succes - sive incubations at room temperature for 5 min , then at 37 °C for 50 min and finally at 70 °C for 15 min . Quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) was performed using a LightCycler 480 SYB Green Master Mix ( Roche Diagnostics ) and real - time PCR RotorGene Q instrument ( Qiagen ) . PCR conditions were 95 °C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C , 10 s at 64 °C and 20 s at 72 °C . Primer sequences were as follows : mRSP9 / F : GCT GTT GAC GCT AGA CGA GA , mRSP9 / R : ATC TTC AGG CCC AGG ATG TA , mRunx2 / F : ACA GTC CCA ACT TCC TGT GC , mRunx2 / R : ACG GTA ACC ACA GTC CCA TC . The levels of Runx2 mRNA were normalized to RSP9 and scaled relative to the expression levels for untreated cells according to the formula 2 − ΔΔ Ct . Data are shown as the mean of technical duplicates of three di ﬀ erent in vitro experiments . 2 . 10 . Statistical analysis R software was used for analysis . 37 Significant di ﬀ erences between two groups were evaluated by a Wilcoxon test . Analysis of variance for more than 2 groups was evaluated with either a Kruskal – Wallis test or an ANOVA when appropriate , followed by a pairwise comparison procedure with a p - value adjustment method of Holm . Values were expressed as the median and inter - quartile range or as mean ± SD . Values of p < 0 . 05 were considered as significant . 3 . Results and discussion It is now largely admitted that besides possessing NA com - plexation ability , gene vectors should deal with cell uptake and intracellular tra ﬃ cking , particularly concerning endosomal escape ability . 38 The aim of our work was to formulate a non - viral polymeric vector suited for siRNA transfection of MSC , with the final aim to be used in vivo ( by contrast to Lipofectamine ) and to present endosomal escape ability in order to deliver the siRNA payload into the cytoplasm of cells . 3 . 1 . Micelle formulation and loading 3 . 1 . 1 . Characterization of physical properties . Because of their influence on the physical characteristics of micelles ( dimensions , electrostatic interactions ) , the nature and length of the polymers are likely to play a role in the structure of micelles and consequently in their e ﬃ ciency in delivering siRNA to MSC , as was encountered with dendritic cells . 35 For this reason , three micelle formulations have been tested ( Fig . 1 ) . M1 and M2 were prepared from the same linear counter polycation ( PLL , 21 000 g mol − 1 ) complexed with two PEO - PMAA polymers with di ﬀ erent PEO block lengths while PMAA was in the same range ( PEO 5000 - PMAA 1300 for M1 and PEO 3000 - PMAA 1200 for M2 ) , and M3 was obtained with PEO 3000 - PMAA 1200 and a branched PEI of 700 g mol − 1 as the polycation . The particular charge ratio R = [ NH 2 ] / [ COOH ] = 1 was pre - viously shown to be adapted for micelle complexation , consid - ering that the concentration of the charges brought by siRNA in the formulation is negligible ( typically 10 − 5 mol L − 1 com - pared with 10 − 3 mol L − 1 for the DHBC and PLL ) . 39 The hydro - dynamic diameters and zeta potentials of the micelles were evaluated in purified water ( Fig . 2 ) . We found that the M1 micelles ( M PEOw1 = 5000 g mol − 1 ) were slightly larger ( D h = 53 . 1 ± 5 . 6 nm ) than the M2 micelles ( M PEOw2 = 3000 g mol − 1 , D h = 37 . 8 ± 1 . 5 nm ) for a comparable PMAA molecular weight ( 1300 g mol − 1 for M1 and 1200 g mol − 1 for M2 ) in water . The formulations presented moderate PdI values of 0 . 238 ± 0 . 003 and 0 . 193 ± 0 . 014 respectively . Similar results were reported using an asymmetric DHBC with a PEO block forming the micelle corona : the hydrodynamic radius and polydispersity index ( PdI ) of the PIC micelles increased with increasing asym - metry . 40 The zeta potential of M1 ( ζ = 3 . 58 ± 0 . 32 mV ) was noticeably lower than that of M2 ( ζ = 7 . 85 ± 0 . 36 mV ) . This could be attributed to the larger POE block size of M1 resulting in the stronger screening of the surface charge . The derived count rate ( DCR ) , which represents the intensity of scattered light by the objects in suspension , was observed to be 5474 ± 650 kcts and 16 000 ± 800 kcts for M1 and M2 respectively . The DCR depends on the size , the density and the concentration of objects in suspension . Besides , the aggregation number of PIC micelles is reported in the literature to decrease with increas - ing asymmetry of the DHBC . 40 Here , the copolymer used for M2 micelles ( PEO 3000 - PMAA 1200 ) is less asymmetric than that used for M1 ( PEO 5000 - PMAA 1300 ) . Therefore , we hypothesize that because of a higher aggregation number and smaller size than M1 micelles , M2 micelles may present a denser structure Biomaterials Science Paper This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017 Biomater .

On introducing siRNA into these micelle formu - lations , M1 and M2 did not impact significantly their size or zeta potential . While it was not possible to form M1 micelles beyond 1 . 5 µM of siRNA in water ; M2 micelles were able to form at 3 µM of siRNA . Because of its lack of stability at high siRNA loading , formulation M1 was discarded for further experiments . The nature of the polycation also had a clear e ﬀ ect on the micelle dimensions . At the same charge ratio , micelles formu - lated with PEI ( M3 ) exhibited a much higher hydrodynamic diameter ( D h = 248 . 7 ± 14 . 0 nm ) than that of PLL - based micelles in water . However , the polydispersity index ( PdI = 0 . 150 ± 0 . 005 ) as well as the zeta potential ( ζ = 3 . 27 ± 0 . 29 mV ) were similar to those measured with PLL - based micelles . PLL is a linear polymer presenting mainly primary and secondary amine groups engaged in electrostatic interactions . In contrast , PEI comprises the primary , secondary and tertiary amine groups , possibly rendered less accessible by steric hindrance owing to the branched structure of the PEI used here . Therefore , although PLL ( 21 000 g mol − 1 ) has a higher mole - cular weight than PEI ( 700 g mol − 1 ) , it may be more e ﬃ ciently complexed to the PMAA block and therefore more condensed inside the micelles cores . These results are in accordance with previous work on similar polyamines , showing a more con - densed core - like structure for PLL ( 15 000 – 30 000 g mol − 1 ) than for branched ( 700 g mol − 1 ) or linear ( 4000 g mol − 1 ) PEI . 41 Increasing the siRNA concentration in this formulation M3 had no significant e ﬀ ect on the physical properties of micelles . The derived count rate ( DCR ) was observed to be 57 830 ± 4250 kcts , which is much higher than for M1 and M2 , hence reflecting the dependence of the DCR measure on the size of the objects in suspension . 3 . 1 . 2 . pH - Triggered disassembly . The pH - triggered dis - assembly is provided by the acidic properties of the PMAA block of the DHBC . In general , the pH at which PIC micelles dis - assemble under acidic conditions is mostly determined by the p K a of the polyacid carboxylic groups . It was suggested that a p K a of approximately 6 . 5 42 would be appropriate to trigger the micelle disassembly at a pH close to that of endosomes ( which undergo a progressive acidification typically from pH 6 . 5 to pH 5 ) . 33 Here , the pH - triggered disassembly was assessed by dynamic light scattering : micelles have been formulated in water and the pH adjusted to the desired values before measuring the DCR . The high value of the scattered light intensity reflects the formation of polymer aggregates of high molecular weight and was previously related to the formation of micelles . 43 For M2 blank micelles ( Fig . 3A ) , the scattered light intensity was significantly lower for pH values of pH = 6 and below ( 1320 ± 20 kcts at pH 4 . 5 ) compared to the DCR value at pH 7 . 5 ( 16 000 ± 800 kcts ) . In the same pH interval , a sharp increase of the PdI from 0 . 210 ± 0 . 010 at pH = 6 to 0 . 868 ± 0 . 180 at pH = 5 ( data not shown ) accounts for the change from a unimodal to polymodal population of polydisperse scattering objects , which indicates micelle dissociation . 41 The lower pH value of disassembly than that of the p K a may be related to the formation of intra - micellar hydrogen bonds between the polymer chains at acidic pH . 43 Blank M3 micelles ( Fig . 3B ) presented a more progressive transition of DCR than M2 below pH = 6 . 5 : only the DCR value measured at pH = 4 . 5 ( 26 000 ± 2100 kcts ) was significantly lower than that at pH = 7 ( 57 830 ± 4250 kcts ) . Moreover , we observed no associated increase in PdI on decreasing the pH : the pH - triggered disas - sembly of M3 micelles thus appeared less pronounced than with M2 micelles , probably due to the wide range of p K a of the three types of amine groups presented by branched PEI . After siRNA loading ( 0 . 75 µM ) , M2 presented a similar pH - triggered disassembly profile below pH = 7 . 5 , as attested by a clear drop in the scattered light intensity along with a sharp increase of PdI from 0 . 248 ± 0 . 070 to 0 . 714 ± 0 . 369 ( data not shown ) . In contrast , siRNA - loaded M3 presented a constant scattered light intensity across the whole pH range and no PdI variation , suggesting that complexation of siRNA completely abolished the pH - triggered disassembly . This further suggested that M3 micelles would not be e ﬃ cient siRNA vectors . The e ﬀ ective Fig . 2 Hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of micelles formed in puri ﬁ ed water .

View Article Online release of RNA from the micelles was evaluated using a spectrofluorimetric assay based on the fluorescence triggered by the binding of a probe ( RiboGreen® ) to RNA . Assuming that RNA molecules trapped inside the micelles are less avail - able for interaction with the dye , the two - fold increase in fluo - rescence intensity from pH 7 to pH 5 reported in Fig . S2 † suggests that RNA is e ﬃ ciently released at acidic pH following micelle disassembly . M2 micelles were further characterized after formulation in PBS , closer to cell culture conditions ( Fig . 4 ) . We observed a higher hydrodynamic diameter ( D h = 101 ± 0 . 6 nm ) coherent with the higher ionic strength in the medium . 44 Upon intro - duction of siRNA at increasing concentrations up to 3 µM , M2 micelles showed a constant hydrodynamic diameter ( Fig . 4A ) . It should be noted that the micelles exhibit excellent stability over time with only small variations in diameter of ca . 20 % and a stable PdI value after a 6 month storage in PBS . Similarly , no significant diameter modification was observed upon dilution in OptiMEM® culture medium , while the decrease in the scattered light intensity is roughly proportional to the decrease in micelle concentration ( Fig . 4B ) . Following these characterizations , M2 micelles were selected as the most promising formulation with the highest loading capacity while clearly maintaining pH - triggered disassembly ability . 3 . 1 . 3 . siRNA complexation e ﬃ ciency . To determine the complexation e ﬃ ciency of siRNA in micelles , we loaded increasing amounts of TAMRA labelled siRNA ( siRNA - TAMRA ) , either free or complexed with M2 micelles , in an electrophor - esis gel ( Fig . 5A ) . Free siRNA migrated slightly toward the cathode due to its negative charge . In contrast , siRNA com - plexed in micelles slightly migrated to the anode , probably due to their small excess of positive charges . Analysis of the relative fluorescence intensity in the main bands showed a linear increase in fluorescence with increasing siRNA - TAMRA con - centration ( Fig . 5B ) . A saturation of the fluorescence intensity for siRNA concentrations was visible beyond 1 . 5 µM . For the quantitative evaluation of siRNA complexation , TAMRA fluo - rescence titration was performed ( Fig . 5C ) . We first assessed that free siRNA - TAMRA molecules were able to pass through the 100 kDa Vivaspin ™ membrane and that blank micelles were e ﬃ ciently retained ( data not shown ) . Then , encapsulation rates were indirectly determined by measurements of the quantity of free siRNA in filtrates after separation of micelles from free siRNA . The measured encapsulation rates were 85 . 4 % for 0 . 5 µM , 90 . 5 % for 1 . 5 µM and 93 . 4 % for 3 µM . Fig . 3 Light scattering monitoring of the micelles ’ pH - triggered dis - assembly .

The influence of a treatment with M2 micelles on the viability of MSC was evaluated by an MTT assay and compared with that of a copolymer and polycations used independently ( Fig . 6 ) . Incubation of cells ( 48 h ) with M2 micelles revealed no significant cytotoxicity for dilutions of 1 / 30 , 1 / 20 and 1 / 10 . However , MSC viability decreased signifi - cantly at a 1 / 5 ( 34 . 6 ± 3 . 6 % cell death ) dilution . We then tested separately the toxicity of the micelle components . Compared with non - treated cells ( 100 % cell viability ) , the copolymer PEO 3000 - PMMA 1200 did not exhibit significant cytotoxicity at all dilution rates ( with less than 20 % of cell death ) . In contrast , cell viability decreases dramatically with increasing PLL con - centration , consistent with the well - known toxicity of cationic polymers at high concentrations . This resulted in no viable cells after 48 hours at the highest concentration ( dilution 1 / 5 ) . We therefore concluded that micelles could be used safely up to a dilution of 1 / 10 , the toxicity of PLL being hindered by its complexation with the copolymer . 3 . 2 . 2 . Internalization e ﬃ ciency and the endocytosis pathway . Micelle internalization into mMSC was visualized by confocal microscopy ( Fig . 7A ) and quantified by FACS ( Fig . 7B ) . Confocal imaging indicated the absence of naked siRNA inside cells since the fluorescence in the TAMRA channel was similar to that of the untreated control cells ( Fig . 7A , images ii and vi vs . images i and v , respectively ) . With either Lipofectamine® or M2 micelles , TAMRA fluorescence repartition seemed to indicate the intracellular location of siRNA , associated with the cells ’ body ( Fig . 7A , panels iii , iv , vii and viii ) . We then performed internalization quantification by flow cytometry . We first evaluated the internalization kinetics of siRNA TAMRA as a function of the vector used ( micelles M2 , M3 and Lipofectamine 2000 , Fig . S4 † ) . This evidenced that more than 90 % of cells had incorporated TAMRA fluorescence after only 2 hours of treatment with Lipofectamine® or M2 micelles . Moreover , it clearly evidenced that the higher hydrodynamic diameter of the M3 micelles – otherwise similar to M2 in terms of DHBC composition and zeta potential – impairs cellular uptake and / or a ﬀ ects their intracellular tra ﬃ cking , as previously reported in the literature . 45 The small size of the polyionic complexes formed could probably be a crucial feature that allowed the micelles to e ﬃ ciently interact with the cell membrane . The M2 micelles ’ intracellular tra ﬃ cking pathway was then investigated with the use of chemical endocytosis inhibitors ( non - toxic concentrations of inhibitors were evaluated as detailed in Fig . S3A , † see Fig . S3B † for cytotoxicity results ) . Cellular TAMRA fluorescence was normalized to the treatment with the M2 micelles without an inhibitor at 37 °C ( representing 100 % ) . Incubation of cells with micelles was also performed at 4 °C to block all non - specific energy - dependent endocytosis mechanisms . At 4 °C , the fluorescence intensity was indeed very low ( 18 . 1 % ) com - pared to that at 37 °C . On adding methyl - β - cyclodextrin ( M β CD ) and genistein , two inhibitors of lipid - raft / caveolae dependent endocytosis , 46 , 47 the geometric mean of TAMRA fluorescence ( MFI ) presented a 72 . 5 % and 69 . 8 % decrease Fig . 5 Evaluation of siRNA complexation e ﬃ ciency of micelles .

View Article Online respectively , demonstrating a clear inhibition of micelle intern - alization compared to the control . In contrast , chlorproma - zine , a clathrin - dependent endocytosis pathway inhibitor , 48 led to no visible decrease in MFI compared with the control . These results suggest that PIC micelles were internalized into MSC by a caveolae / lipid - raft dependent mechanism . This entry route has often been reported for drug delivery with polymeric micelles presenting a PEG corona . 49 , 50 Moreover , the size of M2 micelles is compatible with an internalization pathway involving caveosomes . 51 , 52 It is important to note that , as chemical inhibitors induce either cholesterol depletion or local disruption of the actin skeleton , the extent to which their e ﬀ ect is specific to the targeted endocytic pathway has been questioned . 53 Particularly , M2 micelles could be internalized by the recently described CLIC / GEEC pathway , caveolae and clathrin independently , also inhibited by cholesterol depletion . 54 , 55 In any case , the clear di ﬀ erence between the results obtained with chlorpromazine and M β CD / genistein suggests that endocytosis of micelles is not clathrin - depen - dent . Nevertheless , in contrast to what has been reported previously , 56 most studies now demonstrate that even upon entry by caveolae , the resulting vesicles would reach early endosomes . 57 In this context , once siRNA molecules are released from the micelles ’ core , their gene repression e ﬃ ciency greatly relies on their ability to escape from endo - somes and be delivered into the cytoplasm . 3 . 2 . 3 . Inhibition of a targeted gene expression : Runx2 . Quantitative analysis of extinction of a specific gene expression was performed with a particular targeted gene , the runt - related transcription factor ( Runx2 ) , which was previously shown to be expressed in MSC and associated with bone di ﬀ er - entiation . 58 We assessed whether the PIC M2 micelles e ﬃ cien - tly repressed Runx2 expression in mMSC by studying the mRNA level by real - time quantitative PCR ( Fig . 8A ) . The com - mercial agent Lipofectamine 2000® was used as a positive control . For this , we normalized Runx2 mRNA expression to its mRNA level in the control cells ( no treatment , stated as 1 arbi - trary value ) . We observed a 0 . 57 fold decrease in Runx2 expression for Lipofectamine® and a 0 . 38 fold decrease for M2 micelles compared with non - treated cells . The use of a scramble siRNA ( siCTL ) evidenced that this inhibition was specific to the targeted gene . Compared with siCTL , transfec - tion with M2 micelles complexing siRunx2 resulted in a sig - nificant 0 . 31 fold decrease of Runx2 expression ( p - value Fig . 7 Tracking of the siRNA internalization into MSC .

Higher inhibition rates of 0 . 6 to 0 . 7 fold were reported for cbfa1 / Runx2 in murine MSC with Oligofectamine® . 59 However , the cells transfected in this study were an MSC cell line , C3H10T1 / 2 , while we worked with mMSC primary cells reputed to be more di ﬃ cult to transfect . To allow gene repression , the conformational change of PMAA under acidic conditions , extensively studied by Yessine et al . , 34 , 60 , 61 leads to the formation of hydrophobic domains that are able to interact with the lipophilic endosomal mem - brane . 42 The subsequent destabilization of the endosome membrane results in the delivery of the siRNA cargo directly into the cytoplasm , where it can exert its repressive action by binding to its target mRNA . With the objective to further demonstrate the endosomal escape ability of micelles , the cells were simultaneously treated with micelle complexing Runx2 - targeting siRNA and an endosomolytic agent . Chloroquine has been described to promote the destabiliza - tion of the lysosomal membrane : it is thus expected to enhance gene extinction e ﬃ ciency by promoting the release of the siRNA cargo into the cytoplasm in the case of delivery systems with limited spontaneous endosomal escape ability . 62 , 63 The mRNA level of Runx2 expression ( Fig . 8B ) was not significantly decreased in the presence of chloroquine ( 68 . 9 ± 31 . 4 % ) compared with treatment with micelles in the absence of chloroquine ( 59 . 1 ± 39 . 6 % ) , suggesting that the endosomal escape is not the limiting factor for an e ﬃ cient gene repression with micelles . This also suggests the e ﬀ ective endosomal membrane destabilization by the micelle components . These results demonstrate that the non - viral polymeric vectors developed in this study , the PIC micelles , could represent an alternative of choice for the in vivo delivery of siRNA to mMSC . In particular , they appear to be an alternative to the commercial standard , well described to be poorly adapted to in vivo applications without modifications . 64 Indeed , due to their lower surface charge and their stabilizing PEG corona , PIC micelles are interesting tools for the control of MSC behavior from the perspective of their use in vivo for regenerative medicine .
