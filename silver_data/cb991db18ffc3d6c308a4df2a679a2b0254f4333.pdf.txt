Activation of cell surface receptors generates signals ( including acti - vated Rho family GTPases ) that converge on integrating proteins of the WASp family ( WASp , N - WASP , and Scar / WAVE ) . WASP family proteins stimulate Arp2 / 3 complex to nucleate actin ﬁlaments , which grow at a ﬁxed 70 (cid:14) angle from the side of pre - existing actin ﬁlaments . These ﬁlaments push the membrane forward as they grow at their barbed ends . Arp2 / 3 complex is incorporated into the network , and new ﬁlaments are capped rapidly , so that activated Arp2 / 3 complex must be supplied continuously to keep the network growing . Hydrolysis of ATP bound to polymerized actin followed by phosphate dissociation marks older ﬁlaments for depolymerization by ADF / coﬁlins . Proﬁlin catalyzes exchange of ADP for ATP , recycling actin back to a pool of un - polymerized monomers bound to proﬁlin and thymosin - (cid:12) 4 that is poised for rapid elongation of new barbed ends .

Unicellular organisms use pseu - dopods for directed motility to ﬁnd and engulf food . In multicellular organisms , many different processes depend on cell locomotion , including morphogenetic movements during embryonic development , movement of neurites during devel - opment and remodeling of the nervous system , chemotactic movements of immune cells , and ﬁbroblast migration during wound healing . Depending on their morpho - logy and the cellular context , pseudopods , are called ( rather loosely ) lamellipods , leading lamellae , growth cones , or rufﬂes . Pseudopod extension requires assembly of a specialized network of actin ﬁl - aments at the forward or leading edge of the cell . Actin ﬁlaments are polarized . Based on the arrowhead pattern created when myosin binds actin ﬁlaments , the rapidly growing end of a ﬁlament is called the barbed end . The slowly grow - ing end is called the pointed end . Elongation of the barbed end of actin ﬁlaments drives membrane protrusion ( 133 ) . To generate directed motility in response to ex - ternal cues like chemoattractants , cellular signaling pathways must control actin polymerization and depolymerization . Within seconds such stimuli can initiate directed movements from any site on the surface of a motile cell . When a stimulus ceases or changes direction , pseudopod extension stops just as quickly ( 41 ) . At ﬁrst glance , the ﬁlament network underlying the leading edge of motile cells appears chaotic ( Figure 1 ) . Careful examination , however , reveals a remarkable degree of order and a number of important structural features that appear to be con - served across eukaryotic phyla . The best studied examples are the leading edges of the ﬁsh and amphibian keratocytes ( 126 , 130 , 128 ) . These cells are ideal for both light and electron microscopy . They undergo rapid , constitutive motility and assemble a large , extremely thin lamellipod at the leading edge . The actin ﬁlament network in these lamellae is organized into two roughly orthogonal arrays , with the rapidly growing barbed ends pointing toward the membrane . The ﬁlament network is especially dense near the inner surface of the membrane , and the actin ﬁlaments are connected in a highly cross - linked , branching arbor with short ﬁlaments ap - parently growing from the sides of other ﬁlaments ( 130 ) . These general features are conserved in vertebrate tissue culture cells ( 6 , 130 ) and protozoans ( 28 ) . The concentration of polymerized actin is about 1000 (cid:22) M ( 1a ) . A nnu . R e v .

ACTIN FILAMENT DYNAMICS 547 Figure 1 Electron micrograph of the leading edge of a migrating keratocyte prepared by detergent extraction and rotary shadowing . ( Modiﬁed from 130 . ) In a test tube , polymerizing actin with a cross - linking protein like (cid:11) - actinin produces either an isotropic gel of ﬁlaments or parallel bundles ( 137 ) , so how do cells use these proteins to assemble an ordered and polarized structure ? The key to ordered network assembly is a cellular component that initiates polymerization and cross - linking in a highly localized manner . In the past 2 years , the Arp2 / 3 com - plex ( 65 , 67 , 142 , 145 ) has emerged as the long sought cellular nucleator of actin ﬁlaments . This review focuses on a hypothesis that explains how Arp2 / 3 complex participates in the assembly and disassembly of the leading edge ( Figure 2 ) . Arp2 / 3 complex is a stable complex of seven subunits—two actin - related pro - teins Arp2 and Arp3 with ﬁve novel proteins—p40 ( ARPC1 ) , p35 ( ARPC2 ) , p19 ( ARPC3 ) , p18 ( ARPC4 ) , and p14 ( ARPC5 ) ( Figure 3 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex was discovered in protozoans by afﬁnity chromatography on the actin - binding protein proﬁlin ( 67 , 86 ) . It is abundant ( 58 ) , essential ( 124 ) , and conserved ( 141 ) across eukaryotic phyla . In vitro , the complex also attaches the slowly growing pointed end of an actin ﬁlament to the side of another ﬁlament , producing a 70 (cid:14) branch exactly like those observed in cells ( 83 ) .

The location of step 3 , actin ﬁlament nucleation by activated Arp2 / 3 complex , is not settled . In vitro , free Arp2 / 3 complex can nucleate polymerization , but secondary activation by ﬁlaments strongly favors nucleation on the sides of pre - existing ﬁlaments , coupling nucleation and branching . ( Modiﬁed from 83 . ) ( 128 ) localized Arp2 / 3 to ﬁlament branches at the leading edge . In 1999 several laboratories ( 70 , 115 , 144 , 146 ) discovered that WASp / Scar proteins regulate the nucleation activity of Arp2 / 3 complex , providing for the ﬁrst time a plausible link between many cell surface receptors and de novo actin assembly . Based on these new discoveries , we postulate a concrete , quantitative mecha - nism for the assembly and disassembly of the leading edge ( Figure 2 ) , which we have called the dendritic - nucleation model ( 83 ) . The model proposes that , in the absence of free barbed ends , cytoskeletal components are held in a metastable state , poised for assembly ( step 1 ) . Activation of WASp family proteins ( step 2 ) acti - vates Arp2 / 3 complex to create new barbed ends at a constant rate ( step 3 ) . These ﬁlaments grow rapidly ( step 4 ) and push the membrane forward ( step 5 ) . After a short time , growth of barbed ends is terminated by capping ( step 6 ) . Consequently , the system requires continuous activation of new Arp2 / 3 complex , because it is consumed by incorporation into a network that grows for a limited time . If the rate of nucleation drops to zero , capping stops polymerization automatically ( 84 ) . Constitutive ATP hydrolysis within actin ﬁlaments and dissociation of phosphate ( step 7 ) trigger severing and depolymerization of older ﬁlaments by ADF / coﬁlins ( step 9 ) at a rate that is controlled by some of the same signals that stimulate assembly . Nucleotide exchange catalyzed by proﬁlin ( step 10 ) recycles ADP - actin A nnu . R e v . B i ophy s . B i o m o l . S t r u c t . 2000 . 29 : 545 - 576 .

This is a minimal model with just 5 of the > 60 families of actin - binding proteins ( 101 ) . We focus on these proteins ( proﬁlin and thymosin - (cid:12) 4 , Arp2 / 3 complex , capping protein , and ADF / coﬁlin ) , because they are highly conserved , well char - acterized , and sufﬁcient to induce self - sustaining assembly of dynamic actin ﬁla - ment networks that drive motility of pathogenic , intracellular bacteria ( 63 ) . Most eukaryotic cells use the same abundant set of cytoskeletal proteins to construct pseudopods ( Table 1 ) . Yeasts have similar proteins in dynamic actin patches . Be - cause the building blocks , the overall structure , and ( probably ) the mechanism of assembly are so highly conserved , we regard the leading edge of a motile cell as a discrete cytoskeletal structure , one whose function and design principles were speciﬁed early in eukaryotic evolution .

A number of recent reviews cover the organization of the leading - edge ( 129 ) structure of the key proteins in the system ( 102 ) , the structure of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 85 ) , and activation of Arp2 / 3 complex by WASp / Scar ( 51 , 69 , 140 ) . Earlier reviews of pseudopod extension ( 28 , 29 , 79 ) provide access to the older literature before the discovery of Arp2 / 3 complex and WASp / Scar proteins . HOW DO CELLS MAINTAIN A POOL OF UNPOLYMERIZED ACTIN SUBUNITS ? Studies dating back 25 years ( 18 , 43 ) documented that nonmuscle cells maintain a high concentration of unpolymerized actin , estimated to be (cid:20) 100 (cid:22) M in some cells ( Table 1 ) . Most of this monomer pool has bound ATP ( 117 ) and is presumed to haveboundMg 2 C , giventhehighphysiologicalconcentrationofMg 2 C ( millimolar ) and the low concentration of Ca 2 C ( 0 . 1 (cid:22) M ) . This large pool of Mg - ATP - actin monomers is remarkable because , under physiological conditions , pure ATP - actin from muscle or nonmuscle cells has a critical concentration for polymerization ( K d ) of 0 . 1 (cid:22) M at the barbed end and 0 . 6 (cid:22) M at the pointed end ( Table 2 ) . At 100 (cid:22) M , pure actin in physiological concentrations of salt polymerizes in a few seconds , leaving only 0 . 1 (cid:22) M monomer . Elongation of an actin ﬁlament is a bimolecular reaction between monomers and ﬁlament ends . It can be regulated by controlling the ability of either monomers or ﬁlament ends to participate in the reaction . Cells evolved both mechanisms— proteins that bind monomeric actin and modify its polymerization properties and capping proteins that prevent monomers from adding to ﬁlament ends . Alone , neither mechanism is sufﬁcient to account for the extremely large actin monomer pool in the cytoplasm . The combination creates a metastable state with a huge pool of unpolymerized actin , poised for explosive growth when a cell produces free barbed ends . Monomer - Binding Proteins The main actin monomer - binding proteins in vertebrate cells are thymosin - (cid:12) 4 and proﬁlin . Thymosin - (cid:12) 4 , a small peptide of 43 residues ( 118 ) , competes with TABLE 2 Actin ﬁlament elongation rate constants in 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , pH 7 . 0 ( from 101 ) ATP - actin ATP - actin ATP - actin ATP - actin Barbed end Pointed end Barbed end Pointed end k C ( (cid:22) M − 1 s − 1 ) 11 . 6 1 . 3 3 . 8 0 . 16 k − ( s − 1 ) 1 . 4 0 . 8 7 . 2 0 . 27 K d ( (cid:22) M ) 0 . 12 0 . 62 1 . 9 1 . 7 A nnu .

ACTIN FILAMENT DYNAMICS 551 proﬁlin , a small globular protein of 125 – 139 residues , for binding to overlap - ping sites on actin ( 119 , 123 ) . Only proﬁlin has been found in protozoa , slime molds , and fungi . ( Budding yeasts have no thymosin gene . ) Thymosin - (cid:12) 4 is a true sequestering protein that binds about 50 - fold more strongly to ATP - actin ( K d , 1 . 2 – 1 . 6 (cid:22) M ) than to ADP - actin ( 22 , 57a , 94 , 136 ) . The concentration of thymosin - (cid:12) 4 varies from 600 (cid:22) M in platelets to 20 (cid:22) M in Xenopus eggs ( Table 1 ) and is thought to account for a large fraction of the unpolymerized actin in these cells . Actin bound to thymosin does not polymerize ( 22 , 42 , 57a ) , but proﬁlin competes with thymosin - (cid:12) 4 for binding ATP - actin ( 22 , 57a , 136 ) and can shuttle actin away from thymosin onto the barbed end of actin ﬁlaments ( 94 , 103 ) . Exchange is rapid , owing to the high dissociation rate constants ( 5 s − 1 for proﬁlin and 2 . 5 s − 1 for thymosin - (cid:12) 4 ) . ATP - actin partitions between proﬁlin and thymosin - (cid:12) 4 based on the afﬁnities and concentrations of the binding proteins ( 57a , 97 , 136 ) . Proﬁlin is the main protein that binds ATP - actin monomers in protozoa , slime molds , and fungi , and is present at concentrations of (cid:20) 100 (cid:22) M ( Table 1 ) . Pro - ﬁlins bind cytoplasmic ATP - actin monomers ( K d D 0 . 1 (cid:22) M ) better than cyto - plasmic ADP - actin monomers ( K d D 0 . 5 (cid:22) M ) and muscle ATP - actin monomers ( K d D 0 . 5 (cid:22) M ) ( 96 , 136 ) . The afﬁnity of proﬁlin for actin ﬁlaments is low , be - cause the binding site on the barbed end of actin is buried in the ﬁlament structure ( 123 ) . Proﬁlin - Mg - ATP - actin complexes elongate the barbed end of actin ﬁlaments nearly as quickly as free actin , but do not form nuclei or elongate the pointed end of actin ﬁlaments ( 94 , 103 , 109 ) . High concentrations of proﬁlin slow barbed - end elongation of Mg - ATP - actin (cid:24) 20 % ( 44 , 57 ) , an effect that was originally attributed to rate limiting dissociation of proﬁlin from the barbed end of actin ﬁlaments ( 103 ) . On thermodynamic grounds , it has been argued that proﬁlin should enhance the rate of ATP hydrolysis on the terminal subunit and that this should promote dissociation of proﬁlin ( 44 ) , but we have not been able to detect an effect of proﬁlin on ATP hydrolysis ( 15 ) . Thus the mechanism of the small effect of proﬁlin on barbed - end elongation by Mg - ATP - actin is not yet understood . Similarly , we cannot explain how excess proﬁlin completely inhibits elongation by Ca - ATP - actin ( 44 , 57 ) . Because both free actin monomers and proﬁlin - actin monomer complexes con - tribute equally to elongation of barbed ends ( 57a ) , the concentration of free actin required for growth is less in the presence of proﬁlin than the critical concentra - tion of free actin alone . Proﬁlin is thus said to lower the critical concentration at the barbed end ( 94 ) . In fact , the critical concentration is the same in the pres - ence of proﬁlin ( 57a ) , with both actin and actin - proﬁlin contributing to the critical concentration . Capping Proﬁlin ( and thymosin - (cid:12) 4 when present ) maintains a pool of Mg - ATP - actin that is ready to elongate any available actin ﬁlament barbed ends . If the barbed ends of cellular actin ﬁlaments were free , elongation would rapidly deplete this pool of A nnu . R e v . B i ophy s . B i o m o l . S t r u c t . 2000 . 29 : 545 - 576 .

We do not know what fraction of cellular actin ﬁlaments has free barbed ends , but the micromolar concentration of capping protein ( also called CapZ in muscle ) and its afﬁnity for barbed ends ( K d D 0 . 1 nM ) are sufﬁcient to cap most of the barbed ends ( 122 ) . This is true in cellular extracts ( 32 , 84 ) in which high concentrations of unpolymerized actin monomers are stable in the presence of actin ﬁlaments . The addition of uncapped ﬁlaments to such extracts results in the explosive polymerization of the actin pool . The rate and extent of growth of these new ﬁlaments are limited by capping , which follows a pseudo - ﬁrst - order reaction ( 84 ) . Thus , both monomer binding by proﬁlin and capping of barbed ends are re - quired to maintain a pool of actin monomers . In cells with thymosin - (cid:12) 4 , proﬁlin serves as a carrier between the thymosin - ATP - actin pool and the barbed ends of actin ﬁlaments ( 94 ) . Because neither actin - proﬁlin nor actin - thymosin - (cid:12) 4 elon - gates pointed ends , pointed - end capping is not required to maintain a pool of unpolymerized subunits . Nevertheless , the micromolar concentration of Arp2 / 3 complex and its nanomolar afﬁnity for pointed ends suggest that most pointed ends are also capped ( 83 ) . HOW ARE SIGNALS DIRECTED TO ARP2 / 3 COMPLEX ? External stimuli drive the assembly of the cortical actin ﬁlament network , acting through receptors and multiple signal transduction pathways , several of which converge on WASp / Scar proteins and Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 4 ) . The molecular pathways from receptors to WASp / Scar are not well established , but enough is known to postulate that WASp / Scar proteins integrate diverse signals , including those carried by Rho family GTPases , Rac , and Cdc42 ( 69 ) . Downstream , the ability of active WASp / Scar to stimulate actin ﬁlament nucleation by Arp2 / 3 com - plex is ﬁrmly established ( see below ) , so it is possible that Arp2 / 3 complex is the Figure 4 Domains of WASp / Scar proteins .

Intrinsic signals are also likely to exist for constitutive pseudopod formation but have not been identiﬁed . WASp , the founding member of the WASp / Scar family ( Figure 4 ) , is the protein defective in Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome , a human genetic disease with deﬁciencies in the actin cytoskeleton of platelets and leukocytes ( 92 ) . WASp is expressed in platelets and white blood cells . N - WASP is expressed in brain and many other tissues . Scar was discovered in Dictyostelium discoideum as a suppressor of a mutation in a seven - helix cyclic - AMP ( cAMP ) - receptor ( 11 ) . The vertebrate ho - molog was discovered independently and named WAVE ( 78 ) . In no case do we know the cellular concentration of a WASp / Scar protein , but anecdotal evidence suggests that the quantities are limiting compared with the abundant Arp2 / 3 com - plex . If so , activation of WASp / Scars is likely to be the limiting factor driving actin assembly . WASp / Scar proteins share similar C - terminal WH2 and A domains and a proline - rich central region , but differ in the N - terminal third ( Figure 5 ) . The A domain consists of (cid:24) 30 conserved residues , including a large fraction of acidic residues , and it interacts with the ARPC3 subunit of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 68 ) . The WH2 domain is a 30 - residue motif ﬁrst identiﬁed in verprolin ( 135 ) . This domain A nnu . R e v . B i ophy s . B i o m o l . S t r u c t . 2000 . 29 : 545 - 576 .

Unlike proﬁlin , the WH2 domain does not catalyze nucleotide exchange ( 50 ) . Both the WH2 and A domains are required for efﬁcient activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex and together they are sufﬁcient . All WASp family proteins contain a conserved , proline - rich domain with four to nine clusters of polyproline . This domain binds SH3 - containing proteins ( 127 ) and may bind multiple molecules of proﬁlin . On the N - terminal side of the proline - rich do - main , WASp and N - WASP have a GBD domain , a consensus sequence for binding the small G - protein Cdc42 . Scar appears to be an effector for Rac but not Cdc42 , although it lacks a recognizable GBD . The WH1 domain ( also called the EVH1 domain ) near the N - terminus is folded like a PH domain but binds polyproline - containing ligands . Crystal structures are available of an EVH1 domain ( 39 , 108 ) and a GBD bound to Cdc42 ( 1 ) . N - WASP also has a calmodulin - binding IQ motif . This domain structure gives WASp / Scar proteins the potential to integrate a wide variety of signals , but little is known about the conformation of the full - length proteins , not even an estimate of the native molecular weight . So , much is still to be learned about signal transduction at this level . A strong case can be made for WASp and N - WASP as intermediaries be - tween Rho family GTPases and Arp2 / 3 complex . In vertebrate cells , Rac is required for cell motility , and Cdc42 is required for chemotaxis ( 3 , 45 ) . WASp and N - WASP bind Cdc42 and are required for Cdc42 - stimulated polymerization ( 115 , 146 ) . Cdc42 - induced actin polymerization in cell extracts ( 84 , 148 , 149 ) depends on Arp2 / 3 complex ( 65 , 84 ) . A simple model , supported by cellular stud - ies with dominant - active and dominant - negative Cdc42 ( 78 ) , is that WASp / N - WASP is inactive until activated by GTP - Cdc42 . Scar may be downstream of Rac ( 78 ) , but because it lacks a binding site for Rho family GTPases , it may re - spond to different unidentiﬁed activators , perhaps downstream from the seven helix receptors . HOW DO CELLS CREATE ACTIN FILAMENTS WITH FREE BARBED ENDS ? Proﬁlin and thymosin - (cid:12) 4 strongly inhibit spontaneous nucleation of unpolymer - ized actin , so the limiting factor in actin polymerization in vivo is the creation of free barbed ends . Cells could either initiate new ﬁlaments ( the focus of this section ) or uncap or sever existing ﬁlaments , allowing them to elongate . Uncapping The two most abundant barbed - end – capping proteins , gelsolin and capping pro - tein , both cap ﬁlament ends with nanomolar afﬁnity , and both can be removed by interacting with polyphosphoinositides [ e . g . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 56 , 122 ) ] . In platelets , uncapping of gelsolin - capped ﬁlaments appears to generate free barbed ends and A nnu . R e v . B i ophy s . B i o m o l .

In other cells selective removal of cap - ping protein from ﬁlaments may help ﬁlaments to grow persistently toward the membrane and to organize the three - dimensional structure of the actin network at the leading edge ( see below ) . At least in ﬁlopodia growth of existing ﬁlaments persists at low rates for long times ( 74a ) . Severing Severing existing ﬁlaments into multiple smaller ones can generate new ends . Platelet activation is the best example , in which severing is a major mechanism of inducing actin polymerization ( 10 ) . Platelet activation increases cytoplasmic Ca 2 C , which activates gelsolin to sever actin ﬁlaments and tightly cap their barbed ends . Membrane PIP 2 can remove the gelsolin cap and contribute to the burst of polymerization ( 47 ) . However , gelsolin is not absolutely required , because platelets from mice lacking gelsolin still polymerize and cap new actin ﬁlaments when activated . In ﬁbroblasts the reactions mediated by gelsolin appear to be downstream of Rac ( 5 ) . ADF / coﬁlins also sever actin ﬁlaments ( discussed below ) , but most evidence suggests that this is associated with depolymerization rather than assembly ( 23 , 61 , 116 ) . Nevertheless , coﬁlin - mediated severing has been proposed to generate short actin oligomers that are subsequently stabilized and cross - linked by Arp2 / 3 complex ( 35 ) . This interesting possibility requires further study . De Novo Filament Formation In a many cell types , actin polymerization appears to be initiated de novo by assem - bly of nuclei from actin monomers and nucleation - promoting factors . Although this has long been considered , no barbed - end nucleating factor was known before Arp2 / 3 complex was shown to have this activity . The following section summa - rizes what has been learned about nucleation mediated by Arp2 / 3 complex , but we caution at the outset that an open mind is necessary about the possibility of other factors with such activity . Spontaneous nucleation of actin alone is unfavorable because of the instability of actin dimers and trimers , which are obligate intermediates on the path to longer ﬁlaments . The details of these reactions are still murky , because no assays are available for dimers or trimers . Their properties have been inferred from complete polymerization time courses ( reviewed in 104 ) , using kinetic simulation to estimate equilibrium constants ; K d D (cid:24) 100 , 000 (cid:22) M for dimers and (cid:24) 10 – 100 (cid:22) M for trimers . Filament elongation is a rapid , diffusion - limited reaction ( see below ) . If monomer association reactions are also diffusion limited , the lifetimes of dimers and trimers are exceedingly brief , in the submillisecond range . Nevertheless , under physiological salt conditions , pure actin does form nuclei spontaneously , if slowly , inaveryconcentration - dependentreaction .

Ad - dition of subunits to the ends of existing actin ﬁlaments , which are simply added to a reaction or are uncapped or severed to expose new ends , is elongation , not nucleation . Highly puriﬁed Arp2 / 3 complex nucleates ﬁlaments with free barbed ends and capped pointed ends , but the mechanism is extremely inefﬁcient , because it de - pends on the capture of spontaneously formed actin dimers ( 83 ) . Cells use at least two synergistic regulatory mechanisms to turn on the intrinsically inactive Arp2 / 3 complex . WASp / Scar proteins are primary activators , and actin ﬁlaments are pow - erful secondary activators , an effect that promotes branching . Certain bacteria have evolved their own activators of Arp2 / 3 complex , such as Listeria ActA ( 143 ) . WASP - family proteins activate Arp2 / 3 complex to generate new actin ﬁlaments . Constructs consisting of the WH2 and A domains ( WA ) of all WASp / Scars activate actin ﬁlament nucleation by Arp2 / 3 complex , independently of the rest of the protein ( 70 , 115 , 144 , 146 ) . Under optimal conditions , each WA - activated Arp2 / 3 complex initiates a new ﬁlament ( 50 ) . WA constructs from WASp and Scar interact with Arp2 / 3 subunits in afﬁnity chromatography and yeast two - hybrid assays , and overexpression of WA peptides in vertebrate cells delocalizes Arp2 / 3 and inhibits actin reorganization ( 68 ) . The mechanism of nucleation by WA - activated Arp2 / 3 complex is being inves - tigated . Activation may simply be allosteric—a conformational change induced in the complex by WA ( 85 ) . WH2 domains also bind actin monomers ( 68 ) with submicromolar afﬁnity , so they may actively recruit actin monomers to Arp2 / 3 complex to form a nucleus ( 37 , 50 ) . After nucleation , Arp2 / 3 complex remains attached to the pointed end of the ﬁlament , so it is incorporated into the growing actin ﬁlament network ( 83 ) . Actin ﬁlaments are powerful secondary activators of nucleation by Arp2 / 3 com - plex and WA . Inclusion of ﬁlaments with Arp2 / 3 complex and WA can eliminate the lag at the outset of an in vitro polymerization experiment ( 70 ) . The synergism betweenWAandﬁlamentsbiasestheinitiationofnewﬁlamentstothesidesofexist - ing actin ﬁlaments , where Arp2 / 3 complex anchors end - to - side branches at a ﬁxed angle of 70 (cid:14) ( 12a , 83 ) . Examination of the products by light microscopy revealed that branching occurs during rather than after nucleation ( 12a ) . This coupling between nucleation and branching explains the morphology of the leading edge . The situation must differ in ﬁlopodia , which depend on Cdc42 for initiation ( 78 ) , but which consist of a parallel bundle of ﬁlaments rather than a branching network . Full - length WASp / Scar proteins also activate Arp2 / 3 complex in vitro , but the details differ in the initial reports . Full - length Scar was as active as its WA domain ( 70 ) , so the recombinant protein is constitutively active . Similarly , no GTPase was required for WASp to activate Arp2 / 3 complex ( 146 ) . On the other hand , full - length N - WASP required both Cdc42 and lipid vesicles containing PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to stimulate maximal nucleation activity ( 115 ) . Oddly , both GTP - Cdc42 and GDP - Cdc42 were active in these experiments , whereas Egile et al ( 37 ) found that GTP - Cdc42 was required for N - WASP to activate Arp2 / 3 complex . A nnu . R e v .

ACTIN FILAMENT DYNAMICS 557 Functional Implications Nucleation in cells appears to require a continuous supply of activated Arp2 / 3 complex , because activated complex is physically consumed by incorporation into the ﬁlament network and because capping protein stops polymerization after a few seconds ( see below ) . A supply of barbed ends will be maintained in the cytoplasm only if they are created at the same rate as they are capped . For this reason , any cellular mechanism that produces sustained actin polymerization must induce a constant rate of nucleation rather than produce a ﬁxed number of nuclei all at once . Production of active Arp2 / 3 complex at a constant rate appears to be the function of WASP - family proteins and the Listeria ActA . This dependence on the rate of nucleation may explain why ﬁlament initiation stops abruptly when stimuli , such as chemotactic signals , turn off . Two lines of evidence suggest that activators interact only transiently with Arp2 / 3 complex . Listeria ActA stimulates nucleation by Arp2 / 3 complex but re - mains attached to the bacterial surface , whereas Arp2 / 3 complex is incorporated into the actin comet tail behind the bacterium ( 143 ) . Similarly , addition of WASp - coated beads to cytosolic extracts induces actin polymerization that is dependent on Arp2 / 3 complex , which is incorporated into the actin network leaving WASp behind on the beads ( 146 ) . Thus each molecule of ActA or WASp / Scar may activate multiple Arp2 / 3 complexes . If true , the concentration of activated WASP family proteins will induce a constant rate of nucleation , but more work is required on the rates of the various reactions . The site of activation is unknown but has been suggested to be either on the inner surface of the plasma membrane ( 37 , 115 , 143 ) or in the cortical - ﬁlament network ( 70 ) . Polarity and Coincidence Detection Although far from complete , current evidence suggests that multiple signals con - verge at the same place to maximally activate nucleation . Therefore , the combi - nation of N - WASP and Arp2 / 3 complex may act as a coincidence detector that responds maximally to the combination of active GTPase , phospholipids , actin ﬁl - aments , and other signals . In addition to making ﬁlament formation responsive to a signaling pathway , this mechanism prevents nucleation away from the membrane surface and causes ﬁlaments to feed back positively on their formation . The result is tightly localized ﬁlament formation that , once initiated , accelerates rapidly . This is probably critical for the cell’s ability to polarize rapidly in response to external signals and to maintain polarity during movement . HOW DO NEW FILAMENTS ELONGATE ? Elongation of puriﬁed actin is the best characterized part of this system ( Table 2 ) , because robust assays are available to measure the elongation rates at both ends of ﬁlaments . The ratio of the dissociation rate constant to the association rate con - stant for each reaction gives the dissociation equilibrium constant , also known as A nnu . R e v . B i ophy s .

The critical concentrations for ADP - actin are the same at both ends . ( The apparent difference in Table 2 represents experimental error . ) For Mg - ATP - actin , the critical concentration is considerably lower at the barbed end than at the pointed end , whether measured kinetically during rapid elongation or at steady state . This difference in critical concentrations at the two ends in ATP must be from ATP hydrolysis and / or phosphate dissociation , but the mechanism is not understood . It is not caused by different rates of ATP hydrolysis at the two ends ( 15 ) . Elongation of ATP - actin at the barbed end is diffusion limited by accepted physical - chemical criteria , namely that the reciprocal of the rate constant is pro - portional to the viscosity of the solution and extrapolates to an inﬁnite rate constant at zero viscosity ( 33 ) . Elongation at the pointed end is slower and not diffusion limited . Molecular dynamics simulations ( 125 ) revealed why the rate constants differ at the two ends ; without taking electrostatics into consideration , elongation is favored at the pointed end , but electrostatic effects enhance elongation rates at the barbed end and inhibit elongation at the pointed end , as observed . Through electrostatic effects , proteins such as ADF / coﬁlins bound to actin monomers may accelerate elongation modestly [ 20 % – 50 % ( 125 ) ] , but suggestions that other pro - teins enhance elongation by 10 - or 20 - fold ( 23 ) may not be physically possible . Two opposing factors inﬂuence diffusion - limited reactions in cytoplasm . The high concentration of macromolecules slows diffusion of proteins the size of actin by a factor of about 3 ( 64 ) , but this is compensated for by an excluded volume effect that increases reaction rates , including actin ﬁlament elongation ( 33 ) . At the concentrations of unpolymerized actin found in cells ( 10 – 100 (cid:22) M ) , elongation rates of barbed ends in dilute buffers are exceptionally fast , (cid:24) 100 – 1000 subunits / s , that is , (cid:24) 0 . 3 – 3 (cid:22) m / s . In cytoplasm the rate may be lower , but even if twofold lower , the rate is adequate to account for the rate of pseudopod formation in rapidly moving cells , and it is much faster than required for slow cells like epithelial cells in tissue culture . Some authors argue that diffusion of actin to sites of elongation is rate limiting , but this is unlikely to be true in cells with a large pool of unpoly - merized , freely diffusible actin . In the foregoing , it was assumed that all of the unpolymerized actin is bound to proﬁlin ( Figure 6 ) . This is true in amoebae , but part of the unpolymerized actin pool is bound to thymosin in vertebrate cells . This lowers the available monomer concentration and the rate of elongation . If the concentration of unpolymerized actin really varies as much as reported ( Table 1 ) , the rate of elongation will vary considerably . HOW DO GROWING FILAMENTS PUSH THE MEMBRANE FORWARD ?

The arrows indicate the approximate reaction rates based on rate constants and cytoplasmic concentrations of proteins . was proposed by Tilney et al ( 133 ) . It is consistent with most observations of living cells but has never been demonstrated experimentally to be the mechanism of membrane protrusion in vivo . The best experimental evidence for this mechanism comes from two sources : ( a ) studies in which monomeric actin encapsulated in giant liposomes is induced to polymerize ( 80 ) and ( b ) reconstitution of bacterial motility from puriﬁed components . In giant liposomes the polymerization of pure actin is sufﬁcient to deform the membrane and , in the presence of actin cross - linking proteins , the deformation is quite severe ( 81 ) . Listeria motility requires , in addition to actin , only three proteins ( Arp2 / 3 complex , ADF / coﬁlin , and capping protein ) , none of which is a force - generating motor protein ( 63 ) . Assembly and turnover of the actin comet tail appear to be sufﬁcient to propel the bacterium forward . The microscopic details of polymerization - driven motility are not immediately obvious . Peskin et al ( 98 ) proposed that , when the end of an actin ﬁlament contacts a load , elongation of the ﬁlament could act as a ratchet to rectify the thermal motions of the load . That is , if thermal motions cause the load to ﬂuctuate away from the end of the ﬁlament , elongation of the ﬁlament into the gap will prevent the load from returning to its original position . This might apply to membranes , but not to bacteria , which are too large to undergo appropriate Brownian motions . Mogilner & Oster ( 82 ) combined this idea of a thermal ratchet with the elastic properties of an actin ﬁlament and proposed an “elastic Brownian ratchet” model . In this model , ﬁlaments behave like elastic springs with properties determined by the bending modulus of the ﬁlament and the angle it makes with the load . According to Mogilner & Oster , the thermal ﬂuctuations of actin ﬁlaments are the most important . Thermal motion can displace a ﬁlament from the membrane , allowing room for additional monomers to add to the end of the ﬁlament . The A nnu . R e v . B i ophy s . B i o m o l .

One important prediction of this model is that there is an optimal angle to transmit force from an actin ﬁlament to a load . In the force regime of the leading edge ( (cid:24) 45 pN ) , this angle is (cid:24) 45 (cid:14) as observed in cells ( 130 ; Figure 1 ) . The branches formed by Arp2 / 3 complex are quite stiff ( 12a ) , in keeping with this model . The actin ﬁlament concentration is also consistent with protrusion being driven by polymerization ( 1a ) . WHAT LIMITS THE GROWTH OF FILAMENTS ? Our dominant theme is that control of actin polymerization takes place at the barbed end of the ﬁlament ; to make new ﬁlaments , cells create new barbed ends ; and to limit ﬁlament growth , cells cap barbed ends rapidly ( Figure 2 ) . The sup - porting evidence is that most cells maintain a large pool of polymerizable actin that would disappear if ends were allowed to grow indeﬁnitely ; ﬁlaments injected into living cells do not elongate detectably ( 120 ) , and actin seeds added to cell extracts grow for only a short time and do not deplete the pool of monomeric actin ( 53 , 84 , 149 ) . The factor thought to cap barbed ends in most cells is a ubiquitous heterodimeric protein called capping protein , discovered in amoebae ( 55 ) . Capping protein is abundant in most cell types , with cytoplasmic concentrations in the micromolar range ( Table 1 ) . The muscle isoform of capping protein ( CapZ ) caps the barbed ends of the actin ﬁlaments at the Z - disk ( 26 ) . Injection of function - blocking anti - CapZ antibodies into developing muscle cells profoundly disrupts sarcomere for - mation ( 121 ) . Genetic deletion of capping protein in nonmuscle cells alters the balance between polymerized and unpolymerized actin ( 4 , 54 ) and immunodeple - tion of capping protein from nonmuscle cell extracts removes almost all of the barbed - end capping activity ( 32 ) . Capping protein binds the barbed end of actin ﬁlaments very tightly [ K d D 0 . 1 nM ( 122 ) ] and prevents both association and dissociation of monomers ( 55 ) . Capping protein binds barbed ends with an association rate constant of 3 (cid:22) M s − 1 . At cellular concentrations of capping protein , a free barbed end will have a half - life of about a quarter of a second before it is capped , but , because of the high cellular concentration of monomeric actin , the ﬁlament will have elongated by > 200 monomers during this time . The high afﬁnity of capping protein for barbed ends is a consequence of its extremely slow dissociation rate [ 5 (cid:2) 10 − 4 s − 1 ( 122 ) ] . The half - time for uncapping is > 1000 s , much longer than the lifetime of dynamic actin ﬁlaments in cells ( 27 , 132 ) , so , unless it is actively uncapped or severed , a capped ﬁlament probably never elongates again . If a new ﬁlament is cross - linked into the network with its barbed end pointing away from the membrane , it will probably remain capped until it is disassembled by ADF / coﬁlin . If , however , a capped barbed end collides with a membrane , interaction with poly phosphoinositides like PIP 2 and PIP 3 may remove capping A nnu . R e v . B i ophy s . B i o m o l .

In this way , localized uncapping may bias the growth of ﬁlaments and produce more long ﬁlaments with barbed ends oriented toward the leading edge . This might explain why the barbed ends of all long ﬁlaments in the keratocyte leading edge point forward . New experiments are required to test this idea . Another area for research is to learn how activated Cdc42 protects growing actin ﬁlaments from capping in leukocyte extracts ( 53 ) . Elsewhere in this review , we consider further consequences of uncapping . HOW ARE FILAMENTS MARKED FOR DEPOLYMERIZATION ? Hydrolysis of ATP bound to actin subunits , subsequent to their incorporation into ﬁlaments , and the dissociation of the gamma - phosphate are postulated to mark ﬁlaments for depolymerization by ADF / coﬁlin proteins ( 74 ; Figure 2 ) . New actin ﬁlaments at the leading edge of a cell are built with ATP actin subunits , because ATP - actin is the predominate form of unpolymerized actin ( 117 ) . Phos - phate dissociation is an effective timer for destruction , because the depolymerizing proteins , ADF / coﬁlins ( next section ) , bind polymerized ADP - actin subunits more strongly than ATP - actin or ADP - P i actin subunits ( Table 3 ) . This explains why BeF 3 ( 14 , 23 ) or millimolar concentrations of phosphate ( 14 , 23 , 72 , 74 ) protect ADP - actin ﬁlaments from ADF / coﬁlins in binding , low - shear - viscosity , and de - polymerization experiments . ATP hydrolysis by polymerized actin is irreversible ( 24 ) , but phosphate disso - ciates slowly . By several criteria including critical concentration , ADP - P i actin is very similar to ATP - actin ( 113 ) . ADP - actin is distinctly different . The dissociation equilibrium constant for P i from polymerized ADP - P i subunits is in the low mil - limolar range ( 19 ) , so some ADP - actin subunits may retain the gamma - phosphate in vivo . The nucleotide bound to polymerized actin subunits is not exchangeable along the length of the ﬁlament ( 105 ) , but ATP does exchange rapidly with ADP on the terminal subunits at the barbed ends of ﬁlaments , possibly contributing to the stability of barbed ends ( 131 ) . By inhibiting this exchange ADF / coﬁlin might destabilize barbed ends in cells . Nothing is known about nucleotide exchange on pointed ends .

We now know that much of the actin incorporated into polymer was Ca - ATP - actin . ATP hydrolysis and gamma - phosphate dissociation are both ﬁrst - order reac - tions . The simplest model for these reactions is that each subunit in a polymer acts independently ( 52 ) , so that all have an equal probability of hydrolyzing ATP and dissociating phosphate . The time courses of hydrolysis and phosphate dissociation are consistent with but do not prove this model . Alternatively , it is reasonable to think that the local environment in the polymer might inﬂuence either or both re - actions . The most extreme version of such thinking is a vectorial hydrolysis model in which ATP hydrolysis occurs only at the interface between the central core of ADP - P i - actin subunits and ATP - actin subunits at either end of a growing ﬁlament ( 25 ) . If this mechanism is correct , the hydrolysis rate at the interface of ADP - and ATP - subunits would have to be very high to account for the observed hydrolysis rates , because so few subunits would be eligible for hydrolysis . Kinetics exper - iments cannot prove or disprove this hypothesis , but an experiment of Pieper & Wegner ( 99 ) argues against vectorial hydrolysis . They found that copolymeriza - tion of ATP - actin with a range of ADP - actin concentrations did not affect the rate of ATP hydrolysis by the polymerized actin . The range of ATP hydrolysis rates reported over the years is wide ( Table 4 ) . Some differences are caused by technical limitations of the early work , because the experiments were done before we knew how to make good Mg - ATP - actin . The most recent work with quench - ﬂow methods shows that Mg - ATP - actin ( and Li - ATP - actin ) hydrolyzed ATP about twice as quickly as Ca - ATP - actin . Atomic structures explain the different rates , because Mg 2 C and Li C position the attacking water more favorably than Ca 2 C ( S Almo , personal communication ) . Both groups reporting on the rate of gamma - phosphate dissociation from Mg - ADP - P i - actinsubunitsagreethattherateconstantisabout0 . 002s − 1 ( 14 , 20 , 77 ) , but this half time of > 5 min is too slow to account for the fastest turnover of actin ﬁlaments in vivo [ t 1 / 2 D 23 s ( 132 ) ] . One resolution of this difference is that ADF / coﬁlin increases the rate of phosphate release by a factor of > 10 , although ADF / coﬁlins bind only weakly to ADP - P i - actin subunits ( 14 ) . This is reasonable thermodynamically , because , if phosphate reduces the afﬁnity of ADF / coﬁlin for actin , ADF / coﬁlin must reduce the afﬁnity of phosphate for actin . A nnu . R e v .

ACTIN FILAMENT DYNAMICS 563 Thus phosphate dissociation is the most plausible timer for actin polymer de - structionby ADF / coﬁlin . If true , thelag betweenrapid actin polymerizationin vivo and the enhanced rate of phosphate release by ADF / coﬁlin should inﬂuence the thickness of the network of ATP - actin ﬁlaments near the membrane . Careful ob - servations of ADF / coﬁlin localization revealed differences between highly motile keratocytes and slower ﬁbroblasts ( 128 ) . Keratocytes exclude ADF / coﬁlin from a zone near the membrane , whereas in ﬁbroblasts ADF / coﬁlin is present throughout the cortex , up to the front of the leading edge . This difference may reﬂect more rapid growth of the actin network or a longer lag between actin polymerization and phosphate release in keratocytes than ﬁbroblasts . What about long - lived actin ﬁlaments ? The best example is striated muscle , in which ADP - actin ﬁlaments are stable for hours to days . These ﬁlaments are pro - tected from depolymerization by tropomyosin , which inhibits ADF / coﬁlin binding and depolymerization ( 12 , 91 ) . Some stable actin ﬁlaments in nonmuscle cells , including stress ﬁbers , are also protected by tropomyosin ( 62 ) . The brush border of intestinal epithelial cells is another example , with two populations of stable actin ﬁlaments ( 49 ) . Those in the terminal web are probably stabilized by tropomyosin . Those in the microvilli lack tropomyosin , so they must be stabilized by the other associated proteins . HOW DO FILAMENTS DEPOLYMERIZE ? Filaments turn over rapidly during pseudopod extension ( 27 , 132 ) and during the centripetal ﬂow of the cortical actin ﬁlament network in some stationary cells ( 40 , 138 ) . How fast must subunits dissociate from individual ﬁlaments to account for these rates of polymer turnover ? If all depolymerization were in one zone at a ﬁxed distance from the front of the cell , the rates would have to be very fast , hundreds of subunits per second , because lamellipodia move up to 1 (cid:22) m s − 1 ( 370 subunits / (cid:22) m ) and centripetal ﬂow can be (cid:20) 0 . 8 (cid:22) m s − 1 . However , depoly - merization takes place across a broad zone ( 132 ) , so no one knows how quickly individual ﬁlaments shorten . The situation is more complicated than usually acknowledged . Making the rea - sonable assumption that subunit dissociation is restricted to the ends of ﬁlaments , the rate of depolymerization of a population of polymerized actin depends directly on the intrinsic rate of subunit dissociation ( k − ) and the concentration of free ends minus the rate of subunit association : Depolymerization rate D k − . ends / − k C . ends / . actin monomer / : Dissociation rate constants for Mg - ADP - actin are 7 s − 1 at the barbed end and a very slow 0 . 3 s − 1 at the pointed end ( Table 2 ) . For a given mass of polymer , the concentration of ends depends inversely on their lengths , so the bulk depolymer - ization rate is inversely proportional to polymer length . This is why severing is so important to consider as part of the depolymerization mechanism . In a cell , some barbed ends and some pointed ends will be free and others capped . All of these A nnu .

In no live cell are all of these parameters known . Proteins of the ADF / coﬁlin family are thought to promote recycling of actin ( for review , see 21 ) , because they enhance the dynamics of actin ﬁlaments in Listeria comet tails ( 23 , 116 ) and promote depolymerization of pure actin ﬁla - ments ( 7 , 14 , 23 , 30 , 34 , 66 , 72 , 74 , 90 ) . A major point of disagreement is whether ADF / coﬁlin proteins enhance depolymerization by severing actin ﬁlaments and creating more ends , by increasing the rate of subunit dissociation from one or both ends , or by both severing and rapid subunit dissociation ( for review , see 71 ) . As explained in the following paragraphs , most investigators favor a dual mech - anism with ADF / coﬁlins severing ﬁlaments to increase the number of ends and also increasing the rate constant for subunit dissociation at one or both ends ( Figure 6 , large vertical arrow at the top right ) . Carlier et al ( 23 ) and Ressad et al ( 112 ) have argued that the effects of ADF / coﬁlin on actin ﬁlaments might be ex - plained entirely by a 30 - fold - higher rate of subunit dissociation at the pointed ends of ﬁlaments . Much remains to be learned about the depolymerization mechanism . Binding of ADF / coﬁlins to ADP - actin ﬁlaments is still incompletely under - stood . One basic uncertainty is whether association is cooperative as observed for all ADF / coﬁlins tested ( including amoeba - actophorin ) binding to muscle actin ﬁlamentsornotcooperativeasobservedforamoeba - actophorinbindingtoamoeba - actin ﬁlaments , the only homogeneous system tested to date . Resolving this ques - tion is important for understanding cells , because polymerized actin exceeds the concentration of ADF / coﬁlins , and cooperativity would focus this limited ADF / coﬁlin locally on ﬁlaments and might promote subsequent reactions . For the homogeneous , noncooperative amoeba system , the association rate constant is exceptionally slow , 0 . 03 (cid:22) M − 1 s − 1 , but , for the cooperative system of actophorin and muscle actin , the rate constant increases with saturation from 0 . 008 (cid:22) M − 1 s − 1 to > 0 . 075 (cid:22) M − 1 s − 1 ( 14 ) . The rates of cooperative binding of plant ADF to mus - cle actin are orders of magnitude faster ( 111 ) . Both the very slow binding in the homogeneous system and the cooperative binding suggest that few subunits in bare ﬁlaments are in a conformation that favors binding . Saturating concentrations of ADF / coﬁlins change the twist of the long pitch helix of muscle actin ﬁlaments by 5 (cid:14) per subunit ( 75 ) , a structural change that is suggested to promote severing and subunit dissociation . Binding of ADF / coﬁlins to pyrene - labeled actin ﬁlaments quenches the ﬂuorescence down to the low level of actin monomers ( 14 , 23 ) , a valuable signal to measure binding that does not yet have a structural interpretation . Both tropomyosin ( 12 , 74 ) and phalloidin ( 14 , 74 ) inhibit the binding of ADF / coﬁlins to actin ﬁlaments . A variety of evidence suggests that ADF / coﬁlin proteins sever actin ﬁlaments : direct visualization by ﬂuorescence microscopy ( 48 , 74 ) , electron microscopy ( 30 , 72 ) , viscometry ( 30 , 73 ) , kinetics of spontaneous polymerization ( 34 , 74 , 110 ) , measurement of ends by elongation assays ( 14 , 72 ) , and ﬂuorescence recovery af - ter photobleaching ( 34 ) . The extent of severing depends on the concentration of ADF / coﬁlin and time , but the number of breaks is much lower than the number of A nnu . R e v . B i ophy s . B i o m o l .

For example , mixing 4 (cid:22) M actophorin with 2 (cid:22) M polymer - ized actin severs each ﬁlament of (cid:24) 2000 subunits into (cid:24) 10 shorter ﬁlaments ( 14 ) . In contrast , gelsolin severs actin ﬁlaments with high efﬁciency , with one break per binding event ( 139 ) , so ADF / coﬁlins are said to sever weakly . Other experiments show that ADF / coﬁlins promote the dissociation of subunits from the ends of actin ﬁlaments . The most extensive study ( 23 ) showed that ﬁl - aments depolymerize about 30 - fold more quickly from their pointed ends in the presence of plant ADF , assuming that ADF had no effect on the number of ends . The same study found a 20 - fold increase in the rate of elongation at the barbed end of actin ﬁlaments , a result that can be explained only by an increase in the concen - tration of barbed ends ( 125 ) . Thus the higher rate of dissociation at the pointed end may be explained in part by a higher concentration of ends produced by severing . One unresolved issue is how ﬁlaments can depolymerize in the presence of high concentrations of unpolymerized actin and proteins that cap both ends with high afﬁnity . Why do bare ﬁlament ends created by severing or uncapping become shorter rather than growing or being capped ? How is depolymerization made processive enough that an entire ﬁlament can disappear on a time scale of tens of seconds ? Binding most unpolymerized ATP - actin monomers to proﬁlin ( and thymosin - (cid:12) 4 when present ) allows depolymerization of pointed ends , but strongly favors elongation at free barbed ends . This argues that depolymerization is most likely at pointed ends . However , the rate of ADP - actin dissociation from pointed ends is so slow ( Table 2 ) that even a 30 - fold increase in this rate ( 23 ) may not explain the high in vivo rates of turnover inferred from leukocyte or keratocyte move - ment ( 27 , 132 ) . ATP exchange on subunits at barbed ends of ADP - actin ﬁlaments makes depolymerization even less favorable ( 131 ) and may inﬂuence pointed - end depolymerization as well . Thus , other cellular factors may be required to enhance actin ﬁlament turnover . Onecandidateisactin - interactingprotein1 ( Aip1 ) , aconserved64 - kDaproteinthat interacts with actin and coﬁlin . Aip1 localizes to dynamic regions of the cell cortex such as lamellipodia in Dictyostelium discoideum ( 60 ) . This protein enhances the ﬁlament disassembly activity of ADF / coﬁlin ( 93 , 114 ) , but the published work has not revealed the mechanism . One hypothesis is that , at any given time , few subunits in actin ﬁlaments are in the conformation required to bind ADF / coﬁlin . By interacting with both actin ﬁlaments and ADF / coﬁlin , Aip1 may enhance the binding of ADF / coﬁlin to actin ﬁlaments . Capping poses theoretical difﬁculties for depolymerization at both ends . All of the actin ﬁlaments in the dendritic arbor at the leading edge are associated at their pointed ends with the side of other ﬁlaments , presumably capped by Arp2 / 3 complex ( 128 ) . Therefore , how does depolymerization get started ? One answer is that ADF / coﬁlins sever ﬁlaments between the caps , as shown by experiments with ﬁlaments of pure actin capped on both ends with gelsolin and Arp2 / 3 com - plex . Such double capping does not inhibit depolymerization by ADF / coﬁlin ( 16 , 111 ) . A more difﬁcult question is what prevents capping of free ends during A nnu . R e v . B i ophy s . B i o m o l .

The micromolar cytoplasmic concentrations and nanomolar afﬁnities of capping protein and Arp2 / 3 complex are theoretically sufﬁcient to cap all ends ( 83 , 122 ) . The rate of capping protein binding to barbed ends is expected to leave them free only for brief intervals . Nothing is known about the rate of Arp2 / 3 complex binding to pointed ends , and in principle the large complex may bind so slowly that free pointed ends are left open for longer times . In addition , three potentially synergistic mechanisms might favor processive depolymerization of dendritic actin ﬁlament networks : ( a ) ADF / coﬁlin binding to Arp2 / 3 complex ( 16 ) may inhibit binding to pointed ends ; ( b ) the conformational change induced in actin ﬁlaments by ADF / coﬁlin ( 75 ) may promote dissociation of cappers from one or both ends , particularly if it is cooperative ; or ( c ) ATP hydrolysis and phosphate dissociation from terminal subunits may reduce the afﬁnity of one or both cappers ( 12a ) . To account for the rapid turnover in vivo , it would be helpful if one or more of these mechanisms made depolymerization processive , because rapid recapping appears to have the potential to stop disassembly soon after an end is exposed . HOW DO STABLE FILAMENTS SURVIVE IN CYTOPLASM ? In addition to the intrinsic ATP timer built into actin ﬁlaments , at least two mech - anisms control the stability of actin ﬁlaments in cytoplasm : regulation of severing proteins , including both gelsolin and ADF / coﬁlins , and binding of stabilizing pro - teins like tropomyosin . Phosphorylation of ADF / coﬁlins provides a mechanism for signaling pathways to regulate the stability of actin ﬁlaments . PAK ( a kinase regulated by Rho family GTPases ) activates LIM - kinase ( 36 ) to phosphorylate a serine near the N terminus of ADF / coﬁlins ( 2 , 88 ) . Phosphorylation has no effect on the atomic structure , but reduces the afﬁnity of ADF / coﬁlins for actin monomers and ﬁlaments by about 2 orders of magnitude , presumably by steric and electrostatic effects ( 17 ) . Substitution of an acidic residue for this serine has a much smaller effect ( 112 ) . The extent of ADF / coﬁlin phosphorylation and rate of phosphate turnover depend on agonist stimulation ( 8 , 76 ) . This mechanism may allow signals ﬂowing through Rho family GTPases to coordinate the initiation of new ﬁlaments ( through WASp and Arp2 / 3 complex ) with their rate of turnover ( through PAK , LIM - kinase , and ADF / coﬁlins ) . It is not known whether this regulation of ADF / coﬁlins is global or local in cells . Calcium regulates actin ﬁlament binding and severing by gelsolin ( 147 ) . Free Ca 2 C affects the rate but not the extent of actin ﬁlament severing by gelsolin ( 59 ) . Signiﬁcant binding of gelsolin to actin ﬁlaments is possible at physiological concentrationsoffreeCa 2 C ( 0 . 1 – 1 (cid:22) M ) ( 59 ) . Inrestingcells , thelowconcentration of free calcium may allow very slow severing and contribute to ﬁlament turnover . Transient increases in intracellular free calcium will promote both gelsolin binding and actin ﬁlament severing . A nnu . R e v . B i ophy s . B i o m o l . S t r u c t . 2000 . 29 : 545 - 576 .

ACTIN FILAMENT DYNAMICS 567 One unsolved mystery is how a population of ﬁlaments in lamellapodia survives to become very long . Behind the dense arbor of short ﬁlaments at the leading edge , the actin network is composed exclusively of long ﬁlaments that extend for several micrometers toward the nucleus ( 126 , 128 , 130 ) . Tropomyosin or other stabilizing proteins seem likely , but they have not been shown to be present . HOW ARE SUBUNITS RECYCLED TO THE ATP - ACTIN - PROFILIN POOL ? Acting together , proﬁlin and ADF / coﬁlin enhance the turnover of actin ﬁlaments to a time scale nearly compatible with the one observed in vivo ( 13 , 23 , 31 ) . Re - gardless of the mechanism , the species dissociating from ﬁlaments is likely to be Mg - ADP - actin , either free or bound to ADF / coﬁlin . Most unpolymerized actin has bound ATP ( 117 ) , so nucleotide exchange is required ( Figure 6 ) . The rate - limiting step is dissociation of ADP ( k D 0 . 08 s − 1 for Mg - ADP - actin ) . However , in physiological salt , ADF / coﬁlins bind ADP - actin monomers with high afﬁnity ( K d D 0 . 15 (cid:22) M ) and slow ADP dissociation by > 10 - fold to 0 . 006 s − 1 ( 13 , 23 , 89 ) . In the absence of other actin - binding proteins , a pool of ADF / coﬁlin - Mg - ADP - actin monomers would tend to accumulate . However , proﬁlin competes with ADF / coﬁlin for binding ADP - actin and catalyzes the exchange of ADP for ATP ( 13 ) . This process works , because both proﬁlin and ADF / coﬁlins exchange rapidly with ADP - actin . When proﬁlin binds , ADP dissociates rapidly , and the excess of ATP over ADP in cytoplasm favors rebinding of ATP . Mg - ATP - actin binds tightly to proﬁlin and ( when present ) to thymosin - (cid:12) 4 , restocking the pool of subunits ready to elongate uncapped barbed ends and releasing ADF / coﬁlins to recycle back to ADP - actin ﬁlaments for another round of severing and depolymerization . CONCLUSIONS Exciting new experimental results summarized in the dendritic - nucleation hypoth - esis have opened the way toward a molecular explanation for pseudopod extension . We have described what amounts to an enzymatic cycle that converts the energy of ATP hydrolysis into mechanical force through the polymerization and depoly - merization of actin ﬁlaments . In the inactivated state , the system is poised for assembly , with a large supply of actin monomers ready for rapid elongation when new ﬁlaments are created by the activation of Arp2 / 3 complex . WASp / Scar pro - teins control the activity of Arp2 / 3 complex , which is consumed by incorporation into a branching network of ﬁlaments . Growth of each ﬁlament is transient , owing to rapid capping , so signaling pathways must supply active Arp2 / 3 complex at a constant rate to maintain polymerization and pseudopod extension .

The direction of subunit ﬂow through the system is created by irreversible hydrolysis of ATP bound to poly - merized actin ( and P i release ) and is driven by the higher concentration of ATP than ADP in the cytoplasm . Thus ATP hydrolysis is necessary to return polymer - ized actin back to the unpolymerized monomeric pool . The rates of the reactions explain why cells can change direction so quickly in response to chemotactic signals and why , in the absence of signals , pseudopods tend to collapse . The pace of these events can vary between cell types and in a single cell , depend - ing on the rate of signal input and the concentrations and activities of a few key proteins . Although attractive as an initial attempt at a mechanism , most of the ideas in the dendritic - nucleation hypothesis still require rigorous testing , especially in live cells . In particular , we lack essential information about signaling pathways , signal integration , WASp / Scar activation , nucleation mechanisms , and depolymerization mechanisms .
