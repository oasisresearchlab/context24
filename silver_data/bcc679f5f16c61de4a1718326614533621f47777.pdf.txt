We examined proteomic responses to increasing emersion times and decreasing recovery ( immersion ) times in the mussel Geukensia demissa , which occurs in salt marshes along the east coast of North America . Individuals are found above mean tide level , and can be emersed for over 18 h during spring tides . We acclimated mussels to full immersion at 15°C for 4 weeks , and compared changes in gill protein expression between groups of mussels that were continually immersed ( control ) , were emersed for 6 h and immersed during recovery for 18 h ( 6E / 18R ) , were emersed for 12 h and recovered for 12 h ( 12E / 12R ) , or were emersed for 18 h with a 6 h recovery ( 18E / 6R ) . We found clear differences in protein expression patterns among the treatments . Proteins associated with anaerobic fermentation increased in abundance in 6E / 18R but not in 12E / 12R or 18E / 6R . Increases in oxidative stress proteins were most apparent in 12E / 12R , and in 18E / 6R changes in cytoskeletal protein expression predominated . We conclude that G . demissa alters its strategy for coping with emersion stress over time , relying on anaerobic metabolism for short - to medium - duration exposure , but switching to an air - gaping strategy for long - term exposure , which reduces hypoxia stress but may cause structural damage to gill tissue . KEY WORDS : Geukensia demissa , Proteomics , Intertidal zone , Emersion , Hypoxia , Air gaping INTRODUCTION Residents of the intertidal zone experience cyclical immersion and aerial exposure , and the stark contrast in physical conditions between these two environmental states leads to unique physiological and biochemical stresses . Nearly all intertidal species have arisen from marine rather than terrestrial ancestors , and so stresses associated with the tidal cycle usually occur during aerial exposure . These stresses may include hypoxia , desiccation , heat or cold , UV exposure , and hyposaline stress due to freshwater runoff ( Sagarin et al . , 1999 ; Helmuth et al . , 2006 ; Somero , 2012 ) . Indeed , such physiological stresses often determine the upper vertical limit of a species’ intertidal distribution ( Tomanek and Somero , 1999 ; RESEARCH ARTICLE 1 Biology Department , Franklin and Marshall College , Lancaster , PA 17603 , USA . 2 Elizabethtown Area High School , 600 East High Street , Elizabethtown , PA , 17022 , USA . * Author for correspondence ( peter . fields @ fandm . edu ) Received 5 January 2014 ; Accepted 15 January 2014 Stillman , 2002 ) and many intertidal species experience environmental conditions that approach their physiological limits ( Stillman , 2003 ; Jost and Helmuth , 2007 ) . Because of the magnitude and rapidity of changes in the physical environment of the intertidal zone , intertidal organisms have been used for many years as model organisms by researchers interested in physiological and biochemical adaptation to stressful environments . Geukensia demissa ( Dillwyn ) ( Mytilidae ) , the ribbed mussel widespread in salt marshes along the east coast of North America from southern Florida to the Gulf of St Lawrence ( Blackwell et al . , 1977 ; Gosner , 1978 ) , is one such species that must withstand extreme variation in environmental conditions across a tidal cycle , throughout a day , and over the course of a year . It is the bivalve found highest in the intertidal zone throughout most of its range ( Kuenzler , 1961 ; Lent , 1969 ) , likely due to predation pressure from the blue crab , Callinectes sapidus ( Lin , 1989 ) , and is often emersed for longer periods than it is immersed ( Kuenzler , 1961 ) , spending up to 80 % of the tidal cycle in air ( Hilbish , 1987 ) . It thus is repeatedly exposed to a wide range of physical stressors , and is remarkably tolerant of them . Geukensia demissa survives temperatures of 45°C in the summer in the warmer parts of its range ( Jost and Helmuth , 2007 ) , as well as temperatures as low as − 22°C in the winter in the north ( Kanwisher , 1955 ) , perhaps through the use of bacteria as ice - nucleators in its pallial fluid ( Loomis and Zinser , 2001 ) . Long periods of aerial exposure also lead to significant hypoxia , and G . demissa is known to air - gape , likely to allow aerial respiration ( Kuenzler , 1961 ; Lent , 1968 ; Hilbish , 1987 ) ; however , gaping leads to desiccation and G . demissa has been reported to survive the loss of 38 % of its soft - tissue water content ( Lent , 1968 ) . Geukensia demissa also is an ecologically important and abundant member of the salt marsh community along the east coast of North America . The mussel is found embedded among the rhizomes of the ubiquitous Spartina alterniflora cordgrass that dominates the low marsh , and the byssus of the mussel helps stabilize the organic network that allows the mudflat to accrete ; in the absence of the mussel the salt marsh erodes ( Bertness , 1984 ; Smith and Frey , 1985 ) . Jordan and Valiela calculated that G . demissa filter a volume of water greater than the tidal volume of the marsh each tidal cycle ( Jordan and Valiela , 1982 ) , and Bertness found that the nitrogenous wastes deposited by the mussel increase cordgrass productivity by approximately 50 % ( Bertness , 1984 ) . Given the importance of salt marsh habitat as a nursery for estuarine and marine species , as well as its function as a buffer against shoreline erosion , the substrate stabilization and enhancement of productivity offered by G . demissa are ecologically and economically significant . In the present study we have taken a proteomic approach to more fully describe the physiological mechanisms by which G . demissa withstand long periods of aerial exposure . Although temperature and Changes in protein expression in the salt marsh mussel Geukensia demissa : evidence for a shift from anaerobic to aerobic metabolism during prolonged aerial exposure Peter A . Fields 1 , * , Chris Eurich 1 , 2 , William L . Gao 1 and Bekim Cela 1 T he J ou r na l o f E x pe r i m en t a l B i o l og y 1602 UV stresses are correlated with emersion , we held these factors constant to focus on aerial exposure alone , comparing responses to increasing periods of emersion and decreasing periods of post - emersion recovery . We chose experimental conditions to mimic short - duration exposure during neap tides ( 6 h exposure , 18 h immersion recovery ; hereafter referred to as 6E / 18R ) , longer term exposure ( 12 h exposure , 12 h recovery ; 12E / 12R ) , and exposure conditions that might be experienced by mussels highest in the marsh during extreme spring tides ( 18 h exposure , 6 h recovery ; 18E / 6R ) . We chose to vary exposure and recovery periods concomitantly for two reasons . First , the study design follows the patterns of exposure mussels experience in the field , where emersion and immersion periods are inversely related , but the duration of the entire tidal cycle is constant . Second , it is likely that substantial stress - related protein expression changes occur during the aerial exposure period as well as during recovery , and if exposure or recovery time alone were varied , the total treatment time ( i . e . exposure + recovery ) would differ among the groups . This would give the groups different amounts of time to initiate stress - related transcription and translation , likely affecting protein abundance and protein expression patterns ( PEPs ) and thereby obscuring the effects of emersion stress . Within the gill tissue of G . demissa , our results show a clear signal of increased anaerobic capacity after the shortest period of aerial exposure , but as emersion duration lengthens , evidence of upregulation of fermentative metabolism disappears , and the proteomic response shifts toward oxidative stress protection . After the longest exposure , changes in cytoskeletal components predominate , which may be associated with repair or modification of gill structures after air gaping and desiccation . RESULTS Image analysis of two - dimensional gels We prepared two - dimensional polyacrylamide gels for 24 mussels , six replicates from each of the three treatment groups plus six controls that did not experience aerial exposure . After fusing the gel images of the 24 mussel gill protein samples and manually removing spots associated with electrode smears and the molecular weight ladder , Delta2D software detected 800 protein spots ( see supplementary material Fig . S1 for representative gels from each group ) . Once we had filtered spots using a low - volume cut - off ( below 0 . 05 % average spot volume in all groups ) , 363 spots remained , which were used for the analyses described below . Principal components analysis To identify those protein spots that most significantly contribute to the differences in protein expression among groups after the aerial exposure treatments , we performed principal components analysis ( PCA ) on the 24 samples using data from all 363 protein spots ( Fig . 1 ) . The four treatment groups cluster separately , indicating that the treatments significantly and replicably alter G . demissa gill PEPs . The 6E / 18R group is most separated from the others on the first principal component ( PC1 ; horizontal axis in Fig . 1A , B ) . By definition , PC1 accounts for the greatest amount of variation in protein expression among the samples : 15 . 2 % of variation in the PEPs of all 363 spots is contained within PC1 . PC2 , the vertical axis in Fig . 1A , accounts for 11 . 8 % of variation in PEPs , and this component most clearly separates 12E / 12R from 18E / 6R . Along PC3 ( vertical axis in Fig . 1B ; 8 . 3 % of expression variation ) , the control group is separated from the three treatment groups , especially 12E / 12R and 18E / 6R , which cluster loosely together . Along higher PCs , samples do not cluster by treatment group ( data not shown ) ; these higher components are associated with inter - individual differences in protein expression . The first three PCs explain 35 . 2 % of the variation in gill protein expression among the mussels , and although this percentage may appear low , we note that all 363 detected proteins are included in the analysis , not only those that were shown to change significantly in abundance in response to treatment ( cf . Tomanek and Zuzow , 2010 ) . We used the component loadings derived from PCA to rank individual protein spots and thus determine their relative contributions to the differences apparent among the treatment groups in Fig . 1 . Ordering by positive component loading along PC1 reveals which proteins contribute most to separating 6E / 18R from the other three groups ( Fig . 1A ) . Similarly , along PC2 , proteins most affected by 12E / 12R treatment have high positive loading values , while proteins whose abundance changes most after 18E / 6R treatment have the most negative loadings . Finally , those protein spots with greater abundance in control mussels relative to exposure treatments have higher negative loading values along PC3 ( Fig . 1B ) , where the control group is most clearly differentiated from the others .

T he J ou r na l o f E x pe r i m en t a l B i o l og y Hierarchical cluster analysis To better understand how protein expression changes led to the separation of treatment groups in Fig . 1 , we subjected the 20 spots with the highest component loadings from each group to hierarchical cluster analysis ( HCL ) ; Fig . 2 shows the expression profiles of these 80 proteins . Mussels within each treatment group cluster together ( along the top of the heat map ) , and there are discrete protein clusters associated with each mussel treatment group ( left ) ; the function of proteins in each cluster is described below . Of the 80 spots analyzed , 70 were found to differ significantly in abundance ( ANOVA ; P > 0 . 02 ; significance determined by permutation ) ( Fig . 2 ) . Protein identification After trypsin digestion and MS / MS analysis of the 20 spots with highest loadings from each group , we were able to identify 66 proteins . [ Six of the 14 unidentified spots produced significant matches to our G . demissa EST library , but produced no match ( ‘no significant similarity’ ) or a match to a hypothetical protein in the NCBI nr database . ] Proteins are listed in Tables 1 – 4 according to component loading ; more detailed information about the identification of each protein can be found in supplementary material Table S1 . The 70 spots that differed significantly in abundance among the groups also are indicated in Tables 1 – 4 . Positive component loadings on PC1 are most closely associated with proteins increasing in abundance in group 6E / 18R ( Fig . 1 ) , and proteins associated with catabolic processes are well represented in this group ( Table 1 , Fig . 3 ) . Seven of the 18 identified proteins with high positive loadings on PC1 fall into this category , including succinate dehydrogenase / fumarate reductase ( SucDH / FRD ) subunit B , propionyl - CoA carboxylase ( PCC ) , fumarate hydratase ( fumarase ) , phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase ( PEPCK ) and cytosolic malate dehydrogenase ( cMDH ) . Notably , these five enzymes are central to succinate / propionate fermentation ( Fig . 3A ) ( see Discussion ) . The final two enzymes associated with catabolic processes in the 6E / 18R group are a putative methylmalonate - semialdehyde dehydrogenase and mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenase ( Fig . 3B ) . After 6 h of aerial exposure , only two oxidative stress proteins were found among the 20 with the highest positive component loadings on PC1 , mitochondrial peroxiredoxin ( Prx ) - 5 and a transketolase - like protein ( Fig . 3B ) . Three proteins associated with the cytoskeleton also are present – adenylate cyclase - associated protein 1 , actin - 2 and tubulin α 1C ( Fig . 3B ) . Proteins significantly increasing in abundance in the 12E / 12R group can be identified through high positive loadings on PC2 ( Fig . 1A ) . Eight of the 18 spots identified among this group are oxidative stress proteins ( Table 2 , Fig . 4 ) , including glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) 1 , GST2 , GST σ 3 and Prx - 6 , as well as 6 - 1603 RESEARCH ARTICLE The Journal of Experimental Biology ( 2014 ) doi : 10 . 1242 / jeb . 101758 6E / 18R 12E / 12R Control 18E / 6R P r o t e i n c l u s t e r s Relative spot volume Treatment group clusters Fig . 2 .

It is likely as well that aldehyde dehydrogenase ( AldDH ; two spots ) and type 3 alcohol dehydrogenase , both with relatively high positive loadings on PC2 , are involved in oxidative damage repair ( see Discussion ) . In addition , three cytoskeletal proteins ( adenylate cyclase - associated protein 1 , tubulin α 1C and tektin - 4 ) are among the 18 identified proteins with the highest positive loading values on PC2 ( Fig . 4 ) . Finally , although three of 18 proteins with high positive loadings on PC2 are functionally associated with energy metabolism ( Table 2 ) – triose phosphate isomerase ( TPI ) , glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) and arginine kinase ( AK ) – only GAPDH differs significantly in abundance among treatment groups ( Fig . 4 ) . Proteins that increase most significantly in abundance in response to the 18E / 6R treatment have high negative loadings on PC2 ( Fig . 1A ) . Here , cytoskeletal proteins dominate , with seven of 17 identified proteins belonging to this functional category ( Table 3 , Fig . 5 ) . These include two spots each identified as actin - interacting protein 1 and tektin - 3 , as well as tektin - 4 , β - tubulin and a tubulin - polymerization promoting protein . Energy metabolism and oxidative stress proteins are relatively less abundant , with two spots representing GAPDH identified , and one μ - class GST .

T he J ou r na l o f E x pe r i m en t a l B i o l og y Negative loadings on PC3 ( Fig . 1B ) separate the control samples from the three treatment groups , and thus indicate those proteins that are relatively high in abundance in the control mussels compared with the exposed mussels . Here , 18 of 20 proteins were identified ( Table 4 ) , with BLAST searches of three spots returning the same hypothetical protein ( homologous to a protease ) . Three of the identified proteins are associated with energy metabolism ; however , only one , AK , is significantly increased in abundance ( Fig . 6 ) . Another , catalase , is an oxidative stress protein , and three are cytoskeletal or cell - adhesion proteins . In summary , after G . demissa experience aerial exposure followed by immersion , changes in abundance of gill proteins associated with catabolism / fermentation , the cytoskeleton and oxidative stress predominate : 16 , 11 and 16 of 66 identified proteins , respectively , fall into these categories across the three treatment groups . However , the duration of exposure and recovery clearly affects expression patterns : relatively short exposure followed by extended recovery ( 6E / 18R ) leads to increased abundance of catabolic and especially fermentation proteins ; the 12E / 12R treatment induces increases in the abundance of oxidative stress proteins more than the other treatments ; and 18E / 6R appears to impact cytoskeletal structure most significantly . DISCUSSION Anaerobic metabolism One of the hallmarks of bivalve anaerobic metabolism is the use of fermentative pathways that produce succinate and propionate as end products , rather than lactate as is more commonly found in vertebrates ( Hochachka and Mustafa , 1972 ; Kluytmans et al . , 1977 ; Ho and Zubkoff , 1982 ) . Succinate / propionate fermentation appears to have evolved in eukaryotes such as helminth parasites ( Barrett , 1991 ; Müller et al . , 2012 ) and bivalves that undergo 1605 RESEARCH ARTICLE The Journal of Experimental Biology ( 2014 ) doi : 10 . 1242 / jeb . 101758 Table3 .

In G . demissa after 6 h of aerial exposure and 18 h of immersed recovery , we found that PEPCK was increased in abundance ( Fig . 3A ) , suggesting the shunting of 1607 RESEARCH ARTICLE The Journal of Experimental Biology ( 2014 ) doi : 10 . 1242 / jeb . 101758 Catabolism ( 1 / 18 ) GAPDH a a a b 1 . 6 1 . 2 0 . 8 0 . 4 0 A bundan c e Control 6E / 18R12E / 12R18E / 6R 12E / 12R Cytoskeletal ( 3 / 18 ) Adenylate cyclase - associated protein 1 a , b b c a 0 . 4 0 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 1 0 Control 6E / 18R12E / 12R18E / 6R a a b a 0 . 4 0 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 1 0 Control 6E / 18R12E / 12R18E / 6R a a b a 0 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 1 0 Control 6E / 18R12E / 12R18E / 6R Tubulin α1C Tektin - 4 Oxidative stress ( 8 / 18 ) GST2 Aldehyde dehydrogenase GST1 Aldehyde dehydrogenase GSTr3 Alcohol dehydrogenase Prx - 6 6 - Phosphogluconate DH , decarboxylating a a b a 1 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 20 Control 6E / 18R12E / 12R18E / 6R a , b a , c b c 0 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 1 0 Control 6E / 18R12E / 12R18E / 6R a a b a 0 . 5 0 . 4 0 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 1 0 Control 6E / 18R12E / 12R18E / 6R a a , b b a 0 . 5 0 . 4 0 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 10 Control 6E / 18R12E / 12R18E / 6R a , b b b a 0 . 6 0 . 5 0 . 4 0 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 10 Control 6E / 18R12E / 12R18E / 6R a a b a 0 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 1 0 Control 6E / 18R12E / 12R18E / 6R a a b a 0 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 1 0 Control 6E / 18R12E / 12R18E / 6R a a b a 0 . 4 0 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 1 0 Control 6E / 18R12E / 12R18E / 6R Fig . 4 .

Data are shown as described in Fig . 3 . T he J ou r na l o f E x pe r i m en t a l B i o l og y 1608 glycolytic metabolites into the succinate / propionate fermentative pathway . Furthermore , the next three enzymes in the pathway leading to succinate , namely cMDH , fumarase ( in the mitochondrion ) and sucDH / FRD ( subunit B ) , were all higher in abundance in the 6E / 18R group relative to control , indicating a concerted upregulation of this pathway . SucDH / FRD is the source of two further ATP molecules produced per glucose molecule , and the succinate generated can be decarboxylated to proprionyl CoA , gaining two further ATP molecules ( Hochachka and Somero , 2002 ; Storey and Storey , 2005 ) . We observed that PCC , the central enzyme in this second stage of the fermentative process , is also increased in abundance in G . demissa gill after 6E / 18R treatment . In summary , we have found a clear signal – five proteins out of 18 identified – that fermentative capacity is increased in these mussels after a moderate ( 6 h ) period of hypoxia induced by aerial exposure . Remarkably , however , these five enzymes associated with anaerobic metabolism are not increased in abundance compared with control in mussels experiencing the longer duration aerial exposures , 12E / 12R and 18E / 6R ( Fig . 3A ) . This result seems counter - intuitive , because G . demissa are well known for their ability to withstand long periods of aerial exposure ( Kuenzler , 1961 ; Lent , 1969 ; Hilbish , 1987 ) , and anaerobic metabolism combined with metabolic depression are considered the main tools with which bivalves survive hypoxia associated with aerial exposure ( Gäde , 1983 ; Hochachka , 1986 ; Hochachka and Somero , 2002 ) . However , as discussed below , this conundrum may be resolved by linking proteomic changes we found at later time points with behavioral responses of the mussel , specifically air gaping , after long periods of exposure . A number of other energy metabolism proteins were identified among the 80 proteins having the highest component loadings across all four treatment groups . Two proteins associated with protein catabolism were also increased in abundance in the 6E / 18R group ( Fig . 3B ) : methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase is a component of the branched - chain amino acid degradation pathway , and glutamate dehydrogenase is central to the extraction of NH 3 from amino acids to provide carbon skeletons for catabolic processes . Both increase in abundance in the 6E / 18R group in a pattern similar to that of the succinate / proprionate fermentation enzymes described above . Notably , GAPDH is the only energy metabolism enzyme that showed significant abundance changes in the 12E / 12R and 18E / 6R groups ( Figs 4 , 5 ) ; this enzyme appears to have multiple roles in the cell beyond glycolysis , acting as a transcription factor ( Zheng et al . , 2003 ) , a pro - apoptotic signal ( Hara et al . , 2005 ) and a sensor of oxidative stress ( Chuang et al . , 2005 ) , and perhaps modifying cytoskeletal structure ( Tisdale , 2002 ) . Examination of representative gel images from each treatment group ( supplementary material Fig . S1 ) reveals that the GAPDH identified in the 12E / 12R and 18E / 6R mussels occurs as a series of spots that have the same M r but different isoelectric point ( pI ) values . Such a pattern is consistent with post - translational modifications ( PTMs ) to the enzyme that lead to different charge states , and thus horizontal positions on these gels , and indeed GAPDH is known to undergo a wide variety of PTMs ( e . g . Tisdale , 2002 ; Sen et al . , 2008 ; Seo et al . , 2008 ) . However , further research is necessary to describe the nature and function of these apparent PTMs to GAPDH . In the control group , AK is the only identified energy metabolism protein to differ significantly in abundance relative to the exposure treatments ( Fig . 6 ) . AK plays an important role in recovery from anaerobiosis by generating the phosphagen phosphoarginine , which is able to rephosphorylate ADP during hypoxia without the generation of H + ( Ellington , 2001 ; Grieshaber et al . , 1994 ) . High loading values for AK in control as well as changes in the horizontal position of AK on treatment gels ( supplementary material Fig . S1 ) , which indicates a change of pI of AK after exposure relative to control , are consistent with PTM . Dawson and Storey have shown that crayfish AK is phosphorylated during hypoxia ( Dawson and Storey , 2011 ) , perhaps favoring phosphoarginine utilization over arginine phosphorylation . Analogously , modification of phosphoarginine levels via changes in AK activity may be a strategy G . demissa employs when preparing for extended bouts of aerial exposure . Oxidative stress A nearly inescapable correlate of hypoxia exposure is oxidative damage , due in part to reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production as electrons leak from the slowed electron transport chain , as well as further ROS production upon re - oxygenation after severe hypoxia RESEARCH ARTICLE The Journal of Experimental Biology ( 2014 ) doi : 10 . 1242 / jeb . 101758 Catabolism ( 1 / 18 ) Arginine kinase a b b b 0 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 1 0 A bundan c e Control 6E / 18R 12E / 12R 18E / 6R Control Oxidative stress ( 1 / 18 ) Catalase Cytoskeletal ( 3 / 18 ) Tektin - 3 a b b b 0 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 1 0 Control 6E / 18R 12E / 12R 18E / 6R a b b a , b 0 . 7 0 . 6 0 . 5 0 . 4 0 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 10 Control 6E / 18R 12E / 12R 18E / 6R a a , b a , b b 0 . 5 0 . 4 0 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 10 Control 6E / 18R 12E / 12R 18E / 6R a b b b 0 . 4 0 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 1 0 Control 6E / 18R 12E / 12R 18E / 6R Talin - 2 Actin Fig . 6 . Expression profiles of energy metabolism , oxidative stress and cytoskeletal proteins identified in G . demissa gill whose abundances change significantly in the control group . Data are shown as described in Fig . 3 . T he J ou r na l o f E x pe r i m en t a l B i o l og y ( Hermes - Lima and Zenteno - Savín , 2002 ; Welker et al . , 2013 ) . Here , we found a clear response to ( or preparation for ) oxidative damage in G . demissa as a consequence of prolonged aerial exposure . The strongest response , however , is not after the longest exposure period , 18E / 6R , but after intermediate exposure , 12E / 12R . Proteins with the highest loadings in this treatment group include five that are clearly associated with oxidative stress – three isoforms of GST ( GST - 1 , GST - 2 and GST - 3 ) , a peroxiredoxin ( Prx - 6 ) and the PPP enzyme 6 - phosphogluconate dehydrogenase ( Fig . 4 ) . GSTs comprise a large and diverse superfamily of enzymes whose functions include the transfer of glutathione ( GSH ) groups to initiate repair of oxidatively damaged biomolecules ( Hayes et al . , 2005 ) . Notably , in a similar study by Almeida et al . examining the effects of aerial exposure followed by re - immersion in the brown mussel Perna perna ( Almeida et al . , 2005 ) , the authors found that of the six antioxidant enzymes assayed – catalase , superoxide dismutase , glutathione peroxidase , glutathione reductase , glucose 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase and GST – only GST increased in activity after aerial exposure . Prx - 6 is expressed in the cytosol and uses GSH , rather than thioredoxin like other Prx isoforms , to reduce and detoxify hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxides ( Schremer et al . , 2007 ; Fisher , 2011 ) . Interestingly , this GSH is transferred to the Prx - 6 active site cysteinyl residue by GSTs ( Zhou et al . , 2013 ) . Finally , 6 - phosphogluconate dehydrogenase is also linked to the glutathione system , because as a component of the PPP it is central to the production of NADPH in the cytosol , which is used to regenerate GSH from oxidized glutathione . Notably , the enzymes AldDH and type - 3 alcohol dehydrogenase ( ADH - 3 ) also are both increased in abundance at 12E / 12R relative to other treatments ( Fig . 4 ) . [ Aldehyde dehydrogenase was identified twice , although examination of 12E / 12R gels ( supplementary material Fig . S1 ) indicates that these identifications may represent a single protein spot . ] Aldehyde dehydrogenase acts to reduce aldehyde groups formed from sources such as lipid peroxides ( Kotchoni et al . , 2006 ) during oxidative stress , and is an enzyme of the ‘minimal stress proteome’ ( Kültz , 2005 ) . In addition , it has been shown to change in abundance in response to acute heat and xenobiotic stress in Mytilid mussels ( Tomanek and Zuzow , 2010 ; Apraiz et al . , 2006 ) . Comparably , the ADH - 3 identified in the 12E / 12R group uses the reducing power of glutathione to eliminate formaldehyde ( Danielsson et al . , 1994 ) and S - nitrosothiols ( Liu et al . , 2001 ) . It is worth noting that ADH - 3 is the only ADH form found in cephalopod mollusks ( Kaiser et al . , 1993 ) . These results suggest a role for AldDH and ADH - 3 in protection from oxidative damage , and , assuming this evaluation is correct , eight of 18 proteins with the highest component loadings in 12E / 12R are associated with protection from or repair of oxidative damage . In contrast , the 6E / 18R mussels only had one protein clearly associated with oxidative stress among the 18 identified , mitochondrial Prx - 5 , as well as a second protein , transketolase , that may be associated with oxidative stress because of its role in the non - oxidative phase of the PPP ( Fig . 3B ) . The 18E / 6R group only included one oxidative stress protein , GST μ , a cytoplasmic isoform , despite experiencing the longest period of exposure ( Fig . 5 ) . These results support the interpretation that the shortest duration of exposure , 6E / 18R , is not sufficient to lead to oxidative damage requiring a significant increase in the activity of oxidative stress proteins , whereas the 12E / 12R treatment is . In our model , the absence of a robust oxidative stress response in the 18E / 6R group is associated with their shift of strategy from anaerobiosis to air gaping . Interestingly , one important oxidative stress protein , catalase , appears to decrease significantly in abundance in all treatment groups relative to control ( Fig . 6 ) . Catalase is a ubiquitous enzyme central to the detoxification of hydrogen peroxide , so an apparent reduction in abundance during oxidative stress is counter - intuitive , although there is some evidence for such a response in human mesangial cells ( Venkatesan et al . , 2007 ) . Cytoskeletal rearrangement As mentioned above , an unexpected finding of this study is that the mussels experiencing the longest period of aerial exposure , 18E / 6R , evinced no signal of increased fermentative capacity and only minimal upregulation of oxidative stress protection and repair . We hypothesize that these mussels have a weak proteomic response to hypoxia because they have altered their strategy of coping with aerial exposure from one of anaerobiosis , which appears robustly at 6E / 18R , to one of aerobic metabolism through exposure of gills to air . Air - gaping behavior in G . demissa has been described repeatedly ( Lent , 1968 ; Lent , 1969 ; Malanga and Aiello , 1972 ; Widdows et al . , 1979 ) , and it has been shown that air - gaping G . demissa are able to undergo aerobic metabolism ( Widdows et al . , 1979 ; Nicchitta and Ellington , 1983 ) . Indeed , air gaping is not limited to G . demissa , and has been described in a number of other high - intertidal mussels ( Nicastro et al . , 2010 ; Dowd and Somero , 2013 ) as a response to both hypoxia and high temperature ( via evaporative cooling ) ( Lent , 1968 ) . The present experiment was not designed to examine the impact of gaping on protein expression , and so we measured neither the time of onset nor the duration of gaping in mussels of different treatment groups . However , we were able to determine straightforwardly whether gaping had occurred , because during aerial exposure the mussels were positioned partially buried in artificial seawater ( ASW ) - saturated sand . When they had opened their valves , the water trapped within was clearly apparent , pooled above the sand in the bottom of the air - filled jar . All of the mussels in the 18R / 6E group were gaping at the end of the experiment , with trapped water pooled in the jar ; in the 6E / 18R group there was no water in the jars , indicating the mussels never gaped during the exposure . The 12E / 12R group was intermediate – water present in the jars indicated that mussels had gaped , but not all mussels were gaping at the end of the exposure ; thus , we cannot quantify the extent of the behavior in this group . Although gaping allows G . demissa to resume aerobic metabolism , there are trade - offs to the air - gaping strategy . When the mussel’s valves are separated , the water held within is lost , which clearly leads to the risk of desiccation , and early work showed that G . demissa is remarkably tolerant to tissue water loss ( Lent , 1968 ) . In the present experiment , desiccation stress was minimized by ensuring air in the jars was water saturated . A second stress that may occur during gaping is a loss of physical support for the delicate gill tissue . When the valves are closed and filled with water , the gills are effectively weightless ; however , when the water is lost , the gills collapse and adhere . We hypothesize that the significant changes in expression of gill cytoskeletal proteins in the 18E / 6R group are a response to physical damage that occurs as the gills lose structural support when exposed to air , or a preparation for future air exposure during the next tidal cycle . In this group at least seven of 17 identified proteins with high component loadings are associated with the cytoskeleton ( Fig . 5 ) . Notably , three are tektin isoforms ( two tektin - 3 and one tektin - 4 ) ; tektins are integral microtubule proteins of cilia and flagella ( Pirner and Linck , 1994 ; Amos , 2008 ) . The presence of tektins is noteworthy because the numerous cilia of mussel gills are responsible for creating the water currents that allow the mussel to feed and respire . Any damage to these cilia , which are 1609 RESEARCH ARTICLE The Journal of Experimental Biology ( 2014 ) doi : 10 . 1242 / jeb . 101758 T he J ou r na l o f E x pe r i m en t a l B i o l og y 1610 directly exposed to the external medium , would require rapid repair to maintain feeding and metabolic processes . In addition to the tektins , β - tubulin increased in abundance , as did tubulin - polymerization protein family member 3 , suggesting repair or reorganization of microtubule assemblies , perhaps including those related to ciliary function . The actin cytoskeleton also appears to be modified in 18E / 6R mussels , as actin - interacting protein 1 also increased in abundance ; this protein works together with actin and cofilin to help control actin filament disassembly ( Ono , 2003 ) , thus affecting cell morphology and migration , cell division and endocytosis ( Lin et al . , 2010 ) . In contrast , the 6E / 18R and 12E / 12R groups both showed weaker cytoskeletal responses , with only three of the identified proteins in each group associating with this function ( Fig . 3B and Fig . 4 , respectively ) . Again , changes to the tubulin cytoskeleton – tubulin α - 1c in 6E / 18R and tubulin α - 1c and tektin - 4 in 12E / 12R – may indicate restructuring of cilia . There were three cytoskeleton - associated proteins with high component loadings in the control group ; that is , occurring with relatively low abundance in all treatment groups relative to control . These included a tektin isoform , an actin , and talin - 2 , which is a major component of focal adhesion plates linking the internal actin cytoskeleton to integrin and altering its affinity for extracellular matrix proteins ( Calderwood , 2004 ; Critchley and Gingras , 2008 ) . To summarize , we argue here that the changes in cytoskeletal protein abundance in the 18E / 6R group are a result of structural damage due to air gaping . However , we recognize that further work examining changes to gill structure during gaping in G . demissa and other intertidal mussels is needed to provide support for our hypothesis that air gaping results in a trade - off between the benefits of aerobic metabolism and the costs of damage to gill tissue . Chaperone proteins Molecular chaperones help stabilize or refold other proteins during denaturing stresses , and are central to the minimal cellular stress response ( Kültz , 2005 ) . Thus , it is noteworthy that chaperones do not represent a larger proportion of the proteins whose abundances change significantly in response to aerial exposure . Chaperones with high loading values according to PCA include calreticulin ( 12E / 12R ; Table 2 ) , an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone , heat shock protein ( HSP ) 70 ( 18E / 6R ; Table 3 ) , a ubiquitous cytosolic chaperone , and HSP24 . 1 ( control , Table 4 ) , one of the family of small HSPs that interacts with and stabilizes the actin cytoskeleton during stress ( Arrigo , 1998 ; Dalle - Donne et al . , 2001 ) . However , these last two chaperones were not found to differ significantly in abundance by ANOVA . The small number of chaperones with high loading values , the lack of statistical significance in their abundance changes and the lack of a clear pattern among the treatment groups suggest that protein denaturation is not a significant consequence of the aerial exposures experienced by these mussels , although greater desiccation stress during air gaping might lead to greater chaperone expression . In conclusion , our results demonstrate that G . demissa , and perhaps other intertidal bivalves , do not rely on a single strategy through time to cope with the stress of aerial exposure . Instead , the evidence we present here indicates that exposures of increasing duration lead to the initiation of a variety of responses . First , fermentative capacity is upregulated , but prolonged hypoxia followed by re - oxygenation may lead to oxidative stress , so longer term exposure is marked by increases in oxidative stress proteins . Finally , after the longest duration exposures , fermentation is abandoned as a survival strategy , and air gaping is employed to allow aerobic metabolism to resume , with concomitant physical damage to gill tissue . Further research is necessary to describe how correlated stresses , including desiccation , UV exposure and high or low temperature may affect the biochemical and behavioral survival strategies hypothesized here . MATERIALS AND METHODS Collection and acclimation of animals Adult G . demissa ( shell length 7 – 10 cm ) were collected from the salt marsh south of Stone Harbor , NJ , USA ( 39 . 04N , 74 . 77W ) in May 2012 . Mussels were chilled and transported to Franklin and Marshall College , Lancaster , PA , USA , where they were kept immersed in ASW ( 33 – 35 ppt ; Instant Ocean , Marineland Labs , Mentor , OH , USA ) in recirculating aquaria . Experimental animals were allowed to acclimate for 4 weeks constantly immersed at 15±0 . 2°C , and were fed , per mussel , 0 . 1 ml Instant Algae shellfish diet 1800 ( Reed Mariculture , Campbell , CA , USA ) three times per week . Aerial exposure Experimental mussels were divided into four groups of six individuals . Control mussels experienced no emersion before they were killed . Treatment mussels were exposed to water - saturated air in 800 ml jars in groups of three ; within the jars they were buried approximately ¼ of their shell length in an ASW – sand slurry , in the same vertical position they maintain in the salt marsh . Jars were loosely covered and held at 15°C in a temperature - controlled chamber ( ±0 . 2°C ) for the duration of exposure , and mussels were returned to the 15°C recirculating aquaria for the indicated recovery times before they were killed . No mortality occurred during treatment and recovery . The three treatment groups experienced 6 h of aerial exposure followed by 18 h of immersed recovery ( 6E / 18R ) , 12 h exposure and 12 h recovery ( 12E / 12R ) or 18 h exposure and 6 h recovery ( 18E / 6R ) . Extraction and purification of gill protein Protein extraction , purification and separation methods followed those described elsewhere ( Tomanek and Zuzow , 2010 ) . At the end of the recovery period , gill tissue was excised and immediately homogenized ( 1 : 4 w / v ) in denaturing homogenization buffer [ 7 mol l − 1 urea ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA , USA ) , 2 mol l − 1 thiourea , 1 % ASB - 14 ( Calbiochem , San Diego , CA , USA ) , 40 mmol l − 1 Tris base , 0 . 5 % ampholyte solution ( pH 3 – 10 , GE Healthcare , Piscataway , NJ , USA ) , 1 . 2 % Destreak Solution ( GE Healthcare ) and 0 . 001 % Bromophenol Blue ] using ground glass homogenizers . ( Unless otherwise specified , chemicals were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co . , St Louis , MO , USA . ) Homogenates sat at room temperature ( RT ) for 1 h to solubilize proteins and were centrifuged ( 16 , 000 g , 30 min , RT ) to pellet insoluble material . Proteins were precipitated from homogenate supernatants using 10 % trichloroacetic acid in acetone ( 1 : 4 v / v supernatant : TCA / acetone ) . After overnight incubation ( − 20°C ) , precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation ( 16 , 000 g , 30 min , 4°C ) , supernatant was removed , and pellets were washed three times by vortex - mixing with ice - cold acetone . Protein was resuspended using a volume of rehydration buffer ( 7 mol l − 1 urea , 2 mol l − 1 thiourea , 2 % w / v CHAPS , 2 % NP40 substitute , 0 . 6 % pH 3 – 10 IPG buffer , 1 . 2 % Destreak Solution and 0 . 01 % Bromophenol Blue ) equal to the original homogenization buffer volume . Protein was vortex - mixed and resolubilized overnight at 4°C . Samples were centrifuged ( 16 , 000 g , 30 min , RT ) and the protein concentration of each supernatant was determined using the 2D Quant Kit ( GE Healthcare ) . Supernatants were used immediately for electrophoresis or stored at − 80°C . Two - dimensional gel electrophoresis Proteins were separated on polyacrylamide gels by pI in the first dimension and by molecular mass in the second ( Görg , 2004 ) . Protein samples ( 200 μ l of 1 mg ml − 1 ) were loaded into a single well of an 11 cm isoelectric focusing ( IEF ) tray ( Bio - Rad IEF Cell ) . An immobilized pH gradient ( IPG ) IEF strip ( 11 cm , pH 3 – 10 ; Bio - Rad ) was laid over each sample , and covered with mineral oil to prevent evaporation . Strips rehydrated passively for 6 h and actively ( 50 V ) for 12 h ; water - saturated wicks were placed between the electrodes and the strips before focusing [ 12 , 000 volt hours ( V h ) ; maximum current 50 μ A ] ; wicks were replaced and focusing continued for a total of RESEARCH ARTICLE The Journal of Experimental Biology ( 2014 ) doi : 10 . 1242 / jeb . 101758 T he J ou r na l o f E x pe r i m en t a l B i o l og y 24 , 000 V h . Oil was then blotted from the strips and they were either frozen ( − 80°C ) or used immediately for second - dimension electrophoresis . In the second dimension , proteins were separated by mass using precast SDS - polyacrylamide gradient gels ( 8 – 16 % ; Bio - Rad Criterion ) . Proteins in the IPG strips were equilibrated with SDS by agitation in equilibration buffer [ 6 mol l − 1 urea , 375 mmol l − 1 Tris - HCl pH 8 . 8 , 30 % glycerol , 2 % SDS ( Bio - Rad ) and 0 . 01 % Bromophenol Blue ] . Cysteinyl residues were covalently capped with carbamidomethyl groups to prohibit formation of disulfide bridges , by adding 10 mg ml − 1 dithiothreitol ( DTT ) ( Bio - Rad ) to the buffer used for the first 15 min equilibration , followed by 15 min in equilibration buffer without DTT but containing 25 mg ml − 1 iodoacetamide ( Bio - Rad ) . Strips were placed atop SDS - PAGE gels and held in place with 0 . 8 % agarose . Gels were run simultaneously in groups of six or 12 in Tris - glycine running buffer ( 25 mmol l − 1 Tris base , 190 mmol l − 1 glycine , 0 . 1 % SDS ) using the Bio - Rad Dodeca Cell ( 200 V , ~ 1 h ) cooled to 10°C . Gels were stained overnight with colloidal Coomassie Blue , and destained with multiple washes of 18 M Ω water . Gel image analysis Gel images were digitized at 600 dpi resolution using an Epson model 700 V transilluminating scanner . Images were preprocessed using the histogram tool within the Epson software to maximize contrast , setting γ = 1 to maintain linearity in pixel density . Images were cropped to the gel boundaries using Photoshop software ( Adobe Systems ) . Twenty - four gel images were imported into Delta2D image analysis software ( DECODON , Greifswald , Germany ) , where images were sorted into treatment groups , warped ( i . e . corresponding spots from separate gels were associated ) and fused ( Berth et al . , 2007 ) . The fusion image was used to detect spots employing default software settings , and spot boundaries were transferred back to the original 24 gel images . The relative spot volumes of these proteins ( i . e . the percentage of the total protein volume on each gel ascribed to each spot ) were used for statistical analysis of changes in protein abundance in response to each treatment . Before analysis , we applied a low - volume cut - off filter to remove spots that had a mean relative spot volume less than 0 . 05 % in every group , because protein identification via tandem mass spectrometry ( MS / MS ; described below ) often is unsuccessful when protein volume is below this threshold . We employed PCA within the MeV statistics suite of Delta 2D to determine which protein spots contributed most to the separation of treatment groups , by ranking according to component loading along the first three component axes . We chose the 20 spots from each treatment group ( i . e . 80 spots in total ) with the highest loadings from the PCA analysis for subsequent identification via MS / MS . We also performed hierarchical cluster analysis ( HCL ) ( Pearson correlation ; average linking ) on these 80 spots to better understand relationships in PEPs among spots . We employed one - way ANOVA to determine which of the 80 proteins changed significantly in abundance in response to exposure treatments , utilizing a null distribution ( 5000 permutations ) to account for potential unequal variances and non - normal distributions of protein abundance ( Tomanek and Zuzow , 2010 ) . In order to limit Type 1 errors we used a P < 0 . 02 rather than a multiple comparison correction ( Tomanek and Zuzow , 2010 ; Fields et al . , 2012 ) . We applied a Tukey’s HSD post hoc test ( IBM SPSS Statistics , version 20 ) to identify treatments with differing abundance for each protein shown to be significant via one - way ANOVA . Protein identification The 80 spots identified as contributing most significantly to differences in PEPs among the treatment groups were excised from gels and destained with 25 mmol l − 1 ammonium bicarbonate in 1 : 1 ( v / v ) acetonitrile : water . Gel pieces were dehydrated by soaking in 100 % acetonitrile , and were re - swelled in digestion buffer ( 25 mmol l − 1 ammonium bicarbonate ) containing 10 ng μ l − 1 modified porcine trypsin ( Promega ) . After 4 h incubation ( 37°C ) with shaking , the digest solution was collected for MS analysis . Tryptic peptides were separated and analyzed using a high - pressure liquid chromatography – electrospray ionization ion trap MS / MS ( Agilent 1100 series SL ion trap LC / MS ; Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . The mobile phase consisted of an increasing linear gradient of acetonitrile in water , acidified with formic acid ( 0 . 1 % ) ; peptides were separated on a non - polar C8 column ( Agilent ) before injection into the trap . Agilent software detected peptides via MS , which were automatically analyzed via MS / MS to allow determination of amino acid sequences . Peptide mass lists were submitted to Mascot MS / MS Ions Search software ( version 3 . 1 ; Matrix Science Inc . , Boston , MA , USA ) for identification . Carbamidomethylation of cysteinyl residues ( fixed ) and oxidation of methionyl residues ( variable ) were the only peptide modifications employed during the searches ; precursor mass tolerance was set to 1 . 2 Da and MS / MS tolerance was 0 . 6 Da , the defaults recommended by Mascot . For bioinformatic analysis , we used a G . demissa gill expressed sequence tag ( EST ) library constructed using RNA isolated from gill tissue of four G . demissa individuals ( MPG mRNA purification kit , PureBiotech , Middlesex , NJ , USA ) collected from southern ( Darien , GA , USA ) and northern ( Nummy Island , NJ , USA ) populations . cDNA was synthesized at the Pennsylvania State University Genomics Core Facility and sequenced using a Roche 454 FLX system . ESTs were assembled de novo using iAssembler ( Zheng et al . , 2011 ) . After assembly , the library contained 47 , 736 unique entries that we used as the database against which Mascot searched for matches ; a protein identification was accepted if the molecular weight search ( Mowse ) score exceed the significance threshold ( P < 0 . 05 ) and the match included at least two non - overlapping peptide fragments . ESTs that matched MS / MS peptide sequences were then identified via BLAST search ( tblastn ) of mollusk ( taxon ID : 6447 ) nucleotide sequences in the National Center for Biotechnology Information ( NCBI ) database .
