Meanwhile , the general travel information from traditional travel related websites are hard to satisfy the customers’ requirements . The main challenge for traditional websites is how to provide creative ideas to customers . In order to solve this problem , this paper presents algorithms to achieve customers’ target . This project can be divided into three parts . The first part is to enrich and to analyse the input keywords by semantic web . The second part is to general raw ideas and relevant ideas by an inference engine and lateral thinking . The final part is to generate creative ideas by creative techniques . Keywords—Semantic Web ; Inference Engine ; Lateral Thinking ; Creative ; Creative Ideas ; Ontology I . I NTRODUCTION Tourism as a quality relaxation is widely deployed by people . Travel can be divided into two types , which are business and holiday . Holiday can be divided into seven types : adventure , culture , beach , wildlife , art , region and other special interests . Travel accommodation types can be divided into seven parts : hotels , cottages , cruising , caravan , villa , resorts and others [ 1 , 2 ] . According to different habits , people choose different travel places . There are six factors affecting on people to choose travel place [ 3 , 4 ] , which are history , nature , holiday , culture , fashion and politics . When the people choose the right travel places according to their interests , they enjoy their trips . However , if people use unsuitable information to generate their travel plans , they might have a boring and tedious trip , which cost money and time . Current search engines have mainly three problems . The first problem [ 5 ] is how to search information by keywords , terms , and sentences . No matter how the users restrict the search queries , the results from the search engine display in terms of millions of linked pages , and most of them might not be useful to the user . In fact , the user will never know which pages are exactly matching the query and which the pages are not , unless she checks them all individually [ 7 , 8 , 9 ] . The results from general search engine cannot satisfy customers’ requirement in the following : • information from results is not accurate , • same information from different websites are different , and , • they cannot provide travel plans . Furthermore , some search results are unavailable in the results page [ 5 ] . For example , when people search “Bath” by search engine , in the result page there are few results are not available . Another challenge of search engine is how to let the user find their answers quickly [ 5 ] . The perfect ranking of search results is that end users will find their query in the first page . However , due to advertisements , commercialisation , forward indexing , refreshment policies , etc . , there is not a fairly reasonable ranking of search [ 6 ] . The results provided by search engine are not always fully satisfying user requirements . The more websites covered , the more irrelevant links and redundant links might be found , so the last challenge of search engine is still how to cover most of existing websites [ 10 ] . Creativity is an important part of human life . It happens in every single environment , from home to office , from study to work . People generate novel ideas . When the people found these novel ideas , they got the feeling of “aha” . Creative computing is combination between the objective accuracy of computer system and subjective ambiguity of human creativity [ 11 , 12 ] . Meanwhile , it emphasises utilising multi - disciplines to generate creative results . In addition , lateral thinking is to provide solution in an indirect or creative way [ 56 ] . In tourism area , there are many vectors form different subjects affect human choose their final travel place [ 3 , 4 ] . In this study , combination of multi - disciplinary information is to satisfy customers’ requirement in tourism area based on human’s creativity . If a system can offer creative computing process to generate travel ideas , the travel ideas are creative ideas . Accordingly , the creative travel ideas are generation in certain ways . The aim of this research is to propose an idea refinement framework to generate creative ideas in tourism area , to satisfy customers’ requirement . The paper is organised as following : Section II presents related work of semantic web , creativity and creative techniques . Section III describes the approach to generating creative ideas with explanations of different phases . Section IV introduce a travel creative ideas generation system as a case study , which describes how the system using * Corresponding author 2017 14th International Symposium on Pervasive Systems , Algorithms and Networks & 2017 11th International Conference on Frontier of Computer Science and Technology & 2017 Third International Symposium of Creative Computing 2375 - 527X / 17 $ 31 . 00 © 2017 IEEE DOI 10 . 1109 / ISPAN - FCST - ISCC . 2017 . 91 467 2017 14th International Symposium on Pervasive Systems , Algorithms and Networks & 2017 11th International Conference on Frontier of Computer Science and Technology & 2017 Third International Symposium of Creative Computing 2375 - 527X / 17 $ 31 . 00 © 2017 IEEE DOI 10 . 1109 / ISPAN - FCST - ISCC . 2017 . 91 462 semantic web and creative techniques generates creative ideas in tourism area . Section V concludes this paper . II . R ELATED W ORK This section studies the current research related to semantic web and creative techniques are reviewed , concluding the challenging issues of this paper describe in the next part . A . Semantic Web The main problem for traditional search engines is how to analyse queries comprehensively and deeply and how to present search results with a high level of satisfaction [ 13 , 14 ] . Tim Berners - Lee claimed Semantic Web as a key component of “Web 3 . 0” solve the problem for query analysis [ 15 , 16 ] . Traditional search engines have a perfect logic and standard . If users input the queries follow the system rules , they would get the accuracy and perceive results [ 17 ] . However , users cannot search query professionally . They cannot find the accuracy words to describe their requirement . They might use the synonym or a word with different character . The system cannot follow the previous rules to finish this search . This kind of search results might not achieve the level of user’s requirement . Semantic Web Techniques as a kind of “meaning” connect between the systems logically [ 18 ] . According to semantic web , the queries from costumers can be meaningful that system can integrated readable . Semantic web regards as a dictionary translation the query from human understandable to machine interpretable [ 19 ] . There are many vectors affect people choose their travel place , such as culture , economy , nature and so on [ 3 , 4 ] . It is hard to solve the problem of choosing travel place by one discipline . Thus tourism industry is looking for integrate data and knowledge from other disciplines . The real challenge for semantic web is how to build a professional ontology . The development , management and endorsement of ontology will furnish the semantic technology [ 20 , 21 ] . Not all the ontologies are same characteristics . Ontology can be divided into two part , which are shallow ontology and deep ontology [ 22 , 23 , 24 ] . Deep ontologies are being used widely in science and engineering , which build and develop the conceptualisation [ 22 ] . For different subjects , such as electronics and engineering , the ontology is in a sense classified data . It is aim to distinguish different and complicated prosperities into categories with certain objective [ 22 ] . Shallow ontologies are composed by unchanging items that contain a huge number of data [ 24 ] . Terms such as departure time , arriving time and destination used in transportation context or simple relations are set up by geospatial information . Shallow ontologies process a large number of reuse data and need to pay more attention in set up the rules for terms and relations Research in this areas has a strong advance , after decades of endeavour . Meanwhile , it is hard to analyse and to understand queries deeply by semantic web . Recently , studies are being focused on information retrieve and social network analysis [ 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 ] . Kulcu claimed a new approach of social network analysis based on big data to improve semantic web technology [ 26 ] . Thus , it is necessary to find a method to improve the semantic ability . In other words , the new way to study semantic web can be regards as generation new ideas or creative ideas by semantic techniques . B . Creative Computing Creative computing as a new research flied is being discussed more widely . Many new research field , which are creative thinking , creative design , creative collaboration , creative requirement engineering and so on . , as branch of creative computing , are flourishing development [ 29 , 30 ] . The aim of creative computing is to serve creative process more effectively to improve human creativity [ 30 ] , in other words , is to compute more creatively . The target of Creative Computing is to “unite and conquer” [ 30 ] , is to involve knowledge from different disciplines innovating computing [ 31 , 32 ] . There are three types of creativity based on the properties of creativity [ 33 ] . First one is to create a new product that no one mentions in this area before . Second one is to evaluate an existing product . It is focused on the product itself . The aim of this is to improve creativity and expressiveness . Third one is combine some existing products to make them more creative . People with a clear desire is to travel , but have an ambiguous requirement . Traditional computer techniques with precision computation are to process predicted ideas . Thus , these ideas are general information , which users are known or are useless . How to provide creative ideas to satisfy users’ ambiguous requirement is the biggest challenge in tourism industry . Users choose their travel plan and travel place with many vectors , which are history , nature , holiday , culture , fashion and politics . There are mention kinds of knowledge from different disciplines . Traditional computer techniques solve problems with solo discipline . It is hard to achieve this target . Meanwhile , creative computing is to aim to generate production with new , innovative and valuable , and occurs in computer science . It reconciles the objective accuracy of computer system and subjective ambiguity of human creativity [ 30 ] . In other words , it supports to generate creative ideas in various domains . It is an important issue to solve the travel problems , which is how to satisfy users’ ambiguous requirement . C . Creativity Creativity has been the subject of research in different fields . The research of creativity is much longer than research in software and requirements engineering . The Greek philosophers considered the nature of creativity in human evolution . In the late 19th century , the mathematician , Henri Poincare , considered the nature of successful creative thinking thinking in science [ 38 ] . The current situation of creativity research appeared in the U . S . military during the 2nd world war , followed by an increase in the 1950s when Osborn , Parnes [ 39 ] and Synectics [ 40 ] developed new creative solutions . During the period of 1960s and 1970s , some leaders , such as Edward De Bono , developed lateral thinking [ 41 ] . In addition , Genrich Altshuller improved the TRIZ method [ 42 ] which is used for solving structured creative problems . More recent creativity studies have been conducted in some fields , such as cognitive psychology [ 43 ] , artificial intelligence [ 44 ] and product design [ 45 ] . Nowadays , the result is a large of 468 463 multidisciplinary knowledge of theories and models , as well as lots of collections of processes , techniques and tools for solutions of creative problem . One role of this vision paper is to encourage the exploration and transfer of theories , as well as the transition from knowledge and techniques of creative problem solving research to requirements engineering . By constructing requirements engineering as creative problem solving , it can have a better understanding of it . Also , new knowledge can be gained from other disciplines so as to understand it better and support it more effectively . But what is novel ? Suwa [ 46 ] made more detailed difference by introducing situated creativity where a designer or reasoner had an idea for a specific task novel in a particular situation or field . Most of the creativity in requirements projects is a form of situated creativity . Creating requirements and other consequences are new to project stakeholders , but not new in a historical perspective . It also makes a distinction between creativity and innovation . Creativity concentrates on the generation of novel and useful ideas . However , innovation is defined as the practical application of the results of creative thinking - the creativity that ships illustrated by Bill Gates . Traditional method to solve problems is step by step . Based on consistent observation and empirical thought , a complex problem divided into many kinds of simple problems , solving these simple problems in an easy way . Thus , these a set of results are always observant and lack of creativity . It hard to provide creative results to users . However , lateral thinking stands other aspects , which might be not relevant or involved , to solve the problems [ 56 ] . Later thinking changed route from traditional to creativity [ 55 ] . III . P ROPOSAL This project evaluates existing information to provide creative travel ideas . This set of ideas are interesting and known , but out of original travel ideas . This kind of creativity belongs to users’ knowledge and can be accepted easily . If system presents a total novel travel idea , the users might abandon them because of their travel habits . Thus , the creativity in this project , is to innovate existing information , presenting creative ideas . This paper presents creative travel ideas processing as Figure 1 shows . There are three kernel steps to generate creative travel ideas including “Idea Initialisation” , “Ideas Refinement” and “Idea Finalisation” . In addition , this paper designs a criterion of creativity elements , based on the theory from Boden and Dean [ 49 , 50 , 53 ] . The following pages present more information on these three steps , especially the second step , to describe the whole processing of ideas generation and the third step , to build the criterion of creativity elements and to estimate ideas with creativity criterion . A . Data initialisation Phrase 1 : Idea Initialisation . As Figure 2 shows , this phase bases on Semantic Web to analyse and pre - process the data . Specifically , the analysis part work as following illustration . There are four elements consist this travel ontology which are classes , inferences , truths and raw - data ideas . • Classes : According to affect travel vectors , system build six travel classes which are history , nature , holiday , culture , fashion and politics . These six classes belong to travel information domain . After input queries from users , the system sends the queries to these six class to process . • Inferences : Combination input query from users and characterise of different class , the inferences engine according to semantic web algorithms generates raw data ideas . • Truths : Truths represent few formulas true . • Raw - data ideas : After users input query , the system according to semantic web technology generates raw data ideas which process in the following steps . Fig . 1 . Travel Creative Ideas Process 469 464 Fig . 2 . Raw - Data ideas of Vectors Generation in Travel Ontology Fig . 3 . Rare Ideas Finalisation by Creative Algorithms B . Idea Refinement Phrase 2 : Idea Refinement . Based on analysed and processed query from last phrase , system produces according to design inference engine to generate rare ideas . Lateral thinking is to deviate search during the data processing . In other word , lateral thinking is to provide a process to combine knowledge from different disciplines . Meanwhile , based on unobvious characteristic and potential information , it generates creative algorithms to produce creative rare data . There are four inference task to do the basic management of domain ontology and to ensure the structure of ontology , which are classification test , novel test , valuable test and retrieval . Following contexts explain more details on the four tests . • Classification Test : to determine whether raw data ideas contain explicit meaning that may not be found . Classification test is to distinguish the raw data ideas generation into certain classes . • Novel Test : to determine whether raw data ideas belong to creativity . They are two methods , which are P - creativity and H - creativity to judge the raw data ideas . It is hard to provide H - creative ideas consistently , as a set of ideas is based on people interest . Different people might have same interest . It cannot provide the creative travel ideas never happened before . Thus , most of creative travel ideas in this inference engine belong to P - creativity . • Valuable Test : to determine whether the given travel ideas can be executed . • Retrieval : to retrieve all examples of a given class or all pairs of individuals related via a given idea C . Idea Finalisation Phrase 3 : Ideas Finalisation . As Figure 3 shows , this phase is to analyse rare ideas whether achieve the creativity level and to select and rank creative travel ideas . The pre - processing is to test the rare ideas as good travel ideas can be executed . After that , based on creativity elements and creative algorithms , the step of evaluation is to analyse the rare ideas whether arrive the creativity level . Then , according to creativity level , the system presents the most creative travel ideas to users . Figure 4 shows definitions of the quality dimensions and sub - dimensions , which are based on Dean et at . [ 54 ] collection and summarized current most of the attributes of creative solution and generate ideas . This research based on the definition of Dean , adopted and redefined them according to travel elements . Figure 5 presents the creativity elements and sub dimensions . The aim of this research is to generate creative travel ideas , the creativity elements and sub - dimensions need to be defined or redefined . The next context presents a more comprehensive explanation of each element , which are Novel , Surprising and Valuable . The algorithms to calculate the Novel is designed as follow ( 1 ) : (cid:1840)(cid:1861) (cid:3404) (cid:1840)(cid:1831)(cid:1861) (cid:15910) 1 (cid:15911) The value of New ( NE i ) bases on the concepts and vectors , which is calculated form ( 2 ) , (cid:1840)(cid:1831)(cid:1861) (cid:3404) (cid:3533) (cid:1858)(cid:1870) (cid:3533) (cid:1868)(cid:1863) (cid:3052) (cid:3046)(cid:2880)(cid:2869) (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:4666)(cid:1861)(cid:481) (cid:1870)(cid:481) (cid:1871)(cid:481) (cid:1876)(cid:481) (cid:1877) (cid:1488) (cid:1840)(cid:4667) (cid:3051) (cid:3045)(cid:2880)(cid:2869) (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3) (cid:15910) (cid:884) (cid:15911) 470 465 Fig . 4 .

There is travel interest ti and input q . The value (cid:1872)(cid:1861)(cid:4666)(cid:2010)(cid:1871)(cid:4667) are the interest relevance degrees of concepts (cid:4666)(cid:2010)(cid:1871)(cid:4667) . The scores (cid:1872)(cid:1861)(cid:4666)(cid:2034)(cid:1870)(cid:4667) are the interest relevance degrees of vectors (cid:4666)(cid:2034)(cid:1870)(cid:4667) .

Weights q (cid:3)(cid:4666)(cid:2026)(cid:1871)(cid:481) (cid:2034)(cid:1870)(cid:4667) are assigned based on the degree of each vector . Meanwhile , weights (cid:3)(cid:1869)(cid:3)(cid:4666)(cid:2026)(cid:1871)(cid:481) (cid:2034)(cid:1870)(cid:4667) assigned based on the degrees of the concepts . If one creative travel idea with a high level of novel and surprising , but cannot be executed . It is also not satisfaction the user’s requirement . This a set of travel ideas cannot be recognised as creativity . Finally , the system ranks the creative travel ideas based on score , and return the two results with highest scores to users . IV . C ASE S TUDY The creative travel idea refinement framework illustration in above section is developed called Creative Travel Agency 471 466 ( CTA ) . A prototype of the Creative Travel Agency ( CTA ) is to demonstrate and to prove creative travel ideas generation from this system , satisfying the user’s requirement . Figure 6 shows the system’s input interface , after the user input the query , the system computes in the background and analyses underlying requirements . In this part , semantic web deliver the keywords into six different domains seeking the relationship between keywords and data . Based on four tests ( classification test , novel test , valuable test and retrieval ) from inference engine , and the keywords will transfer into raw ideas . Finally , according to creative algorithms , the system calculates the creative level of ideas and presents them to users . There are two results present to the user , as Figure 7 shows . Fig . 6 . CTA Input Screenshot Fig . 7 . CTA Output Screenshot V . C ONCULSIONS In this paper , an idea generation system is proposed to generate creative travel ideas , aiming to satisfy users’ explicit requirements . Moreover , creativity elements with its algorithms are used to analyse creative travel ideas . In addition , a demonstration of the Creative Travel Agency ( CTA ) was designed and developed for this , which aims to achieve the users’ requirement and presents more travel options to users . Related studies on semantic web are to analyse query and to generate raw data ideas . Creative computing is to build a creative inference engine to support creative travel ideas generation . And , lateral thinking forms the algorithms for creativity . Finally , the creativity elements and creative algorithms are to analyse the travel ideas arriving at a creativity level . There could be two aspects to improve and promote this research : ( 1 ) to add personal interest vectors into creative algorithms , and ( 2 ) to promote the systems on the idea initialisation phrase .
