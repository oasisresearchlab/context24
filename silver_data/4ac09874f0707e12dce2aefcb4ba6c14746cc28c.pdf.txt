Since the first discovery in 1980s as Ras homologous small GTPases , over twenty mammalian Rho family members have been identified that can be divided into several subgroups [ 2 ] . Among Rho GTPases , RhoA , Rac1 , and Cdc42 are the best characterized members , and have well - characterized roles in regulating actin cytoskeleton organization and dynamics [ 3 ] . RhoA , Rac1 and Cdc42 were first described to promote the formation of stress fibers , lamellipodia and filopodia in fibroblast respectively [ 4 ] , and were subsequently appreciated for their roles in regulating signaling pathways affecting cell polarity , gene expression , cell - cycle progression , and cell survival [ 5 ] . Like Ras , classical Rho GTPases such as RhoA , Rac1 , and Cdc42 are molecular switches that cycle between an active GTP - bound form and an inactive GDP - bound form . They bind to GTP or GDP and can hydrolyze bound GTP . Three main families of regulatory proteins tightly control Rho GTPase activities : guanine - nucleotide exchange factors ( GEFs ) , GTPase - activating proteins ( GAPs ) , and guanine - nucleotide dissociation inhibitors ( GDIs ) ( Figure 1 ) . GEFs catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP to activate Rho GTPases [ 6 ] , while GAPs accelerate the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rho GTPases to inactivate them [ 7 ] . After translation , the Rho GTPases are geranylgeranylated , or less commonly farnesylated , in a C - terminal CAAX motif to promote their translocation to intracellular membranes where they are activated [ 8 ] . Rho GDIs bind to Rho GTPases in their inactive GDP bound form and sequesters them in the cytosol , thus acting as the inhibitor of Rho GTPases [ 9 ] . The actions of Rho GTPases are mediated by effector proteins [ 10 ] . When bound to GTP , Rho GTPases undergo conformational changes and associate with a large number of potential effectors , including enzymes and scaffolding proteins , to mediate diverse yet specific cell behaviors . For example , during 2 - dimensional cell migration , Rac1 and Cdc42 promote the actin - driven protrusions at the cell leading edge , whereas RhoA controls the actomyosin contraction at the cell body and rear . In 3 - dimensional conditions , cells adapt different modes of migration dependent on spatial and temporal activation of Rho GTPases in response to the environmental cues [ 11 , 12 ] . RhoA mediates stress fiber formation mainly via Rho - kinase ( ROCK ) and mammalian diaphanous ( mDia ) , while Rac1 and Cdc42 regulate actin re - organization by signaling via p21 - activated kinases ( Pak ) or IQ - domain GTPase - activating protein ( IQGAP ) . In addition , Cdc42 further signals via the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome proteins ( WASP ) and Rac1 via the WASP - related WAVE to initiate actin rearrangement . In addition to actin - dependent activities , Rac and Cdc42 also activate the JNK and p38 MAP kinase cascade [ 13 , 14 ] that may affect tumor cell proliferation and metastasis . In this review , we focus largely on the prototypical Rho GTPases , RhoA , Rac1 , and Cdc42 , and discuss their involvement in cancer and the ongoing strategies targeting their signaling pathways for future cancer therapy .

Rho GTPase signaling pathways and cancer Rho GTPases , as well their regulators and effectors , have been implicated in multiple aspects of cancer [ 15 - 17 ] ( Table 1 ) . Unlike Ras , which is mutated in approximately 20 - 30 % of human cancers , mutations in Rho GTPases are much less frequent and have just been appreciated . While emerging data suggest that mutations in various Rho proteins may occur in multiple cancer types , the main body of experimental evidence has focused on the regulatory mechanisms by which Rho GTPase activities are controlled . These mechanisms include altered expression levels of Rho GTPases or their regulators and altered localization patterns . 2 . 1 Rho GTPases in cancer In addition to the notable case of RhoH [ 18 ] , activating mutations in RhoA and Rac1 have been reported in several cancer types ( Table 1 ) . According to Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer ( COSMIC ) [ 19 ] , somatic mutations of RhoA , Rac1 , and Cdc42 are present in a variety of tumor tissues , most at low frequency ( 0 . 5 % and below ) . Rac1 mutations are enriched in melanoma ( 5 - 6 % ) and RhoA mutations in both hematopoietic / lymphoid ( 4 . 6 % ) and stomach ( 7 % ) tissues . Cdc42 mutations , however , show no obvious tissue enrichment . The hotspot mutations of RhoA ( G17V ) and Rac1 ( P29S ) account for 46 % and 68 % of all mutations identified , respectively . However , the biological and clinical significance of each hotspot mutation remains unclear . A recent study suggests that Rac1 P29S melanoma mutation may confer resistance to RAF inhibitors [ 20 ] . Although somatic mutations of Cdc42 are detected in many tumor tissues , these mutations are more sporadic . In a study to identify driver mutations for melanoma , G12V mutation of Cdc42 , similar to an oncogenic Ras mutation in various cancers , was identified in one sample [ 21 ] . Whether such Cdc42 mutation can drive cancer needs to be verified . There is ample experimental evidence that over - expression of Rho GTPases contributes directly to the proliferative and metastatic properties of cancer cells [ 22 , 23 ] . Most of these experiments involve manipulating the expression or activity of Rho GTPases in cancer cell lines by over - expressing constitutive active form or dominant negative form of Rho GTPases , their regulators or effectors , or using RNAi or small molecule inhibitors . However , those experiments are limited by approaches regarding specificity , dosage , and cell clonal variation . More recent genetic mouse models targeting individual Rho GTPases have provided convincing evidence for their physiological roles . Direct targeting of RhoA , Rac1 , or Cdc42 is embryonic lethal , so a variety of tissue - specific conditional knockout mouse models have been generated ( reviewed in [ 24 - 26 ] ) . RhoA is highly over - expressed in a variety of cancer types ( Table 1 ) . In the case of breast cancer , CD44 interacts with a RhoA - specific GEF to induce RhoA and ROCK activation , which promotes cell growth and metastasis [ 27 ] . Inhibition of RhoA signaling by over - expression of a dominant negative form of ROCK blocks the metastatic activity by CD44 . RhoA is also important for the metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells . Inhibition of ROCK by expressing dominant negative ROCK or using small molecule inhibitor Y - 27632 reduces the intrahepatic metastasis of those cells in SCID mice [ 28 ] . Similarly , knockdown of RhoA or RhoC in aggressive non - inflammatory or inflammatory breast cancer cells reduces Lin and Zheng Page 3 Expert Opin Drug Discov .

A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t invasion , motility and growth rate [ 29 ] . In colonic adenocarcinoma cells , leptin - induced invasion is potentiated by over - expression of the active form of RhoA and abrogated by the dominant negative form of RhoA or Rac1 [ 30 ] . In lung carcinoma A549 cells , ROCK inhibitor Y - 27632 enhances the cisplatin - induced cytotoxicity through suppression of focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) - independent mechanism [ 31 ] . These observations suggest that inhibition of RhoA signaling enhances the effect of anti - cancer agents . The role of RhoA in cancer is beginning to be revealed by genetic studies . RhoC deletion of RhoC shows no effect on tumor growth but decreases tumor metastasis in a breast cancer model [ 32 ] . Gene targeting of RhoA does not appear to affect K - Ras driven lung adenoma formation ; rather , a combined RhoA and RhoC gene deletion is required to suppress lung cancer initiation [ 33 ] . Increased expression of Rac1 is reported for a variety of cancers ( Table 1 ) . Rac1 signaling is important for leptin - induced invasion in colonic adenocarcinoma cells [ 30 ] . Rac1 and Cdc42 are necessary for autotaxin - induced tumor motility in A2058 melanoma cells by a mechanism that may involve PAK and FAK [ 34 ] . In line with the observations obtained using dominant negative form of Rac1 , RNA interference - mediated depletion of Rac1 strongly inhibits lamellipodia formation , cell migration and invasion of SNB19 glioblastoma cells and BT549 breast carcinoma cells [ 35 ] . Similarly , in human PC - 3 prostate cancer cells , shRNA knockdown of Rac1 inhibits tumor cell diapedesis [ 36 ] . Inhibition of Rac1 by dominant - negative mutant inhibits aberrant cell proliferation of NF2 - deficient cells [ 37 ] . Rac1 conditional knockout mouse studies have shown that Rac1 is required for K - Ras driven tumorigenesis in lung and skin cancer [ 38 , 39 ] . Such a Rac1 requirement may be cancer - type dependent as endothelial - specific Rac1 deletion shows no effect on tumor growth or angiogenesis [ 40 ] . Over - expression of Cdc42 has also been detected in some cancer types ( Table 1 ) . Rat mammary adenocarcinoma cells MTLn3 with over - expression of dominant negative form of RhoA or Cdc42 shown reduces number of focal contacts , inhibits colony formation in soft agar and affects cell growth in vivo [ 41 ] . In anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( ALCL ) driven by oncogenic fusion proteins , knockdown of Cdc42 by shRNA results in a cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of ALCL cells . In addition , Cdc42 is necessary for the growth and maintenance of established lymphomas in vivo [ 42 ] . Genetic deletion of Cdc42 in Ras - transformed cells inhibits proliferation , cell cycle progression and tumorigenicity [ 43 ] . Loss of Cdc42 also attenuats the tumorigenicity of mutant intestinal tumor cells [ 44 ] . Notably , the role of Cdc42 in cancer may be double - sided , as Cdc42 knockout in hematopoietic stem cells results in myeloproliferative disorder [ 45 ] . 2 . 2 Rho regulators in cancer The fact that Rho GTPases are often over - expressed or hyper - activated but less frequently mutated in many cancers suggests that regulatory proteins likely play a crucial role in dysregulating signaling pathways that promote cancer initiation and progression . Up - regulation of RhoGEFs or inhibition of RhoGAP and RhoGDI can lead to increased activation of Rho GTPases and promote aberrant signaling cascades . Mutations or aberrant expression of RhoGEFs , RhoGAPs , and RhoGDIs have all been detected in human Lin and Zheng Page 4 Expert Opin Drug Discov . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2016 June 18 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t cancer [ 16 , 17 ] . Because RhoGEFs are positive regulators , they represent good candidates for aberrant Rho GTPases activation in cancer . There are two classes of RhoGEFs : the classical Dbl family RhoGEFs and the DOCK family RhoGEFs . The Dbl family of RhoGEFs includes over 70 members , many of which are conserved from yeast to human [ 46 ] . Dbl RhoGEFs share conserved tandem Dbl homology ( DH ) - pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domains for GEF activity and diverge significantly elsewhere [ 6 ] . The DOCK family of RhoGEFs includes 11 members and acts as GEFs for Rac and / or Cdc42 , but not RhoA , and is structurally and mechanistically distinct from Dbl RhoGEFs [ 47 ] . Several RhoGEFs are mutated or up - regulated in human cancer . Among them , Dbl , Vav1 / 2 / 3 , Ect2 , Tiam1 / 2 , P - Rex1 / 2 are best validated and extensively reviewed [ 46 , 48 ] . Compared to up - regulation of GEF activity in human cancer , gain - of - function mutations in RhoGEFs are less common . One example of activating mutation is the leukemia - associated RhoGEF ( LARG ) , which was isolated as a fusion partner to the mixed lineage leukemia ( MLL ) gene in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) [ 49 ] . Later , it was shown to specifically activate RhoA in vivo , suggesting a role of LARG / RhoA signaling axis in leukemia [ 50 ] . Mutations in LARG are identified at low frequency in a variety of tumor tissues ( COSMIC ) . LARG belongs to the subfamily of the regulator of G - protein signaling ( RGS ) domain - containing RhoGEFs and couples the signaling from G - protein coupled receptors through G α 12 / 13 to RhoA signaling . In childhood AML driven by the fusion gene AML1 - ETO ( AE ) , LARG is identified as a direct target for AE . As a transcription factor , AE significantly increases the expression level of LARG , resulting in hyper - activation of RhoA . Remarkably , LARG - specific shRNA targeting in human AE cells leads to increased apoptosis and inhibits the growth of AE + leukemia without affecting control human blood progenitor cells or MLL - AF9 expressing leukemia cells . These findings , together with the ubiquitous expression of LARG , make this RhoGEF an exciting target for pharmaceutical intervention . The negative Rho GTPase regulators , RhoGAPs and RhoGDIs , are relatively less well understood in the context of cancer . RhoGAPs constitute a large family with more than 70 members in eukaryotes [ 7 ] . All RhoGAPs contain a conserved ~ 150 - amino - acid RhoGAP catalytic domain but share little other sequence homology . In both RhoGEFs and RhoGAPs , the diversity outside the catalytic domain allow them to be controlled in a spatial and temporal manner and serve as critical nodes to specifically mediate different signaling events . RhoGDIs , including RhoGDI1 , 2 and 3 , contain two domains : the C - terminal domain that contains the geranylgeranyl - binding pockets and binds the Rho GTPases , and the N - terminal regulatory domain that locks - in the Rho GTPases and prevents their nucleotide exchange and hydrolysis . They associate with Rho GTPases in their GDP - bound form and maintain a stable , soluble pool of inactivated Rho GTPases in the cytosol [ 8 ] . Mutations or dysregulation of RhoGAPs or RhoGDIs has been detected in human cancer [ 16 , 17 ] , although less evident than that for RhoGEFs . One of the best characterized RhoGAPs , Deleted in liver cancer - 1 ( DLC - 1 ) , was originally discovered as a gene deleted in liver cancer [ 51 ] . Subsequently , it has been found to lose expression in many human cancers ( Table 1 ) . Reintroduce of DLC - 1 into liver , lung or breast cancer cell lines results in reduced growth in vitro and in vivo [ 52 - 54 ] . These observations suggest an important role of DLC - 1 in Lin and Zheng Page 5 Expert Opin Drug Discov . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2016 June 18 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t cancer as a tumor suppressor [ 55 ] . Another RhoGAP implicated in cancer is p190RhoGAP . p190 - A is encoded on chromosome 19q13 . 3 that is often deleted in oligodendrogliomas [ 56 ] . There is evidence that p190 - A can act to inhibit PDGF - induced gliomas in mice and serves as tumor suppressor [ 57 ] . Whereas P190 - B , located on chromosome 14q12 , is likely a target for amplification in hepatocellular carcinoma [ 58 ] . RhoGDIs have been associated with many cancers [ 9 , 16 ] ( Table 1 ) , but the specificity of each RhoGDI for each Rho GTPase is less understood . Since there are only three RhoGDIs that may act on more than twenty Rho GTPases , each RhoGDI may interact with multiple Rho GTPases and thus be subject to complex regulation . The involvement of RhoGDIs in cancer is likely complicated [ 9 ] . RhoGDI expression patterns in a single type of cancer , expression of a given RhoGDI among cancer types , and their activities toward particular Rho GTPases , vary significantly . For example , RhoGDI1 expression is upregulated in colorectal and ovarian cancer , but reduced in brain cancers . In breast cancers , both RhoGDI1 and GDI2 expression levels are reported to be increased or decreased in different studies . 2 . 3 Downstream Rho effectors and signaling in cancer Rho GTPases utilize a wide variety of downstream effector proteins to regulate diverse cellular functions in response to various intracellular and extracellular stimuli [ 10 ] . There is a long - standing interest in understanding how each Rho GTPase , when hyper - activated by mutations or aberrant expression of upstream regulators , contributes to tumorigenesis through a unique set of effectors and signaling pathways . Two of the best - characterized effector proteins downstream of RhoA are the Rho - associated protein kinases , ROCK1 and ROCK2 ( also known as Rho kinases ) . They are serine / threonine kinases that phosphorylate multiple targets including myosin light chain ( MLC ) , the myosin binding subunit ( MYPT1 ) of the MLC phosphatase , and LIM kinases 1 and 2 ( LIMK1 and LMK2 ) . Activated ROCKs lead to increased myosin - driven contraction through MLC phosphorylation and promote actin filament stabilization through LIMK - mediated phosphorylation and inactivation of cofilin . ROCKs regulate cancer cell invasion and metastasis and have been studied extensively [ 59 ] . Recent studies have revealed additional functions of ROCK to their classic roles in cell motility , which include gene transcription , proliferation , differentiation , apoptosis and oncogenic transformation [ 60 ] . Notably , somatic ROCK1 activating mutations have been identified in human cancers [ 61 ] , and large - scale sequencing has revealed mutations in both ROCK1 and ROCK2 that are associated with human cancers [ 62 , 63 ] . Another well known effector protein serine / threonine kinase family implicated in cancer is the P21 - associated kinase ( Pak ) family effectors of active Rac1 and Cdc42 [ 64 - 66 ] . There are six mammalian members that can be divided into two subgroups based on their homology : group I ( PAK1 - 3 ) and group II ( PAK4 - 6 ) . In mice , PAK1 is highly expressed in brain , muscle , and spleen , PAK2 and PAK4 is ubiquitously expressed , whereas PAK3 , PAK5 , and PAK6 are enriched in neuronal tissues . Genetic deletion of each Pak showed that they have both overlapping and distinct functions . Group I Paks are autoinhibited homodimers when inactive and binding of Rac / Cdc42 results in the dissociation of the dimer and subsequent activation , but the activation mechanism of group II Paks is less clear . In addition to Lin and Zheng Page 6 Expert Opin Drug Discov . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2016 June 18 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t dysregulated Rac / Cdc42 activities , over - expression or mutational activation of Pak isoforms contributes to the increased Pak activity found in various human cancers . Amplification of PAK1 on chromosome 11q13 has been reported in breast [ 67 ] , ovarian cancer [ 68 ] , and melanoma [ 69 ] . Similarly , amplification of PAK4 on chromosome 19q13 is commonly observed in pancreatic cancer [ 70 , 71 ] and oral squamous - cell carcinoma [ 72 ] . Recently , activating mutations in the PAK4 and PAK5 gene are associated with colon and lung cancers [ 73 , 74 ] . Activated Paks drive several oncogenic signaling pathways to impact tumor cell motility , survival and proliferation [ 66 ] . As the major effectors of Rac1 and Cdc42 , Paks promote cell motility via several mechanisms . PAK1 facilitates actin stabilization through phosphorylation of MLC , LIMK , filamin A and dynein light chain 1 ( DLC1 ) [ 75 ] . The PAK1 / LIMK pathway is required for Rac1 - induced actin reorganization at the cell leading edge during migration [ 76 ] . PAK1 also functions to induce rapid turnover of focal contacts at the cell leading edge via phosphorylation of paxillin [ 77 ] . Expression of dominant negative PAK1 in invasive breast carcinoma cells reduces invasion and metastasis [ 78 ] . Group II Paks seem to utilize different mechanisms to participate in cytoskeleton reorganization . Cdc42 recruits PAK4 to the Golgi and induces the formation of filopodia . Activated PAK4 leads to dissolution of stress fibers and loss of focal adhesions [ 79 ] . In addition to their role in tumor invasion and metastasis , most Paks promote cell cycle progression when over - expressed . Paks activate the Erk , PI3K / Akt , and Wnt signaling pathways that are tightly associated with cell proliferation . In the Erk pathway , PAK1 phosphorylates both MEK1 and Raf1 for efficient Erk activation . It has been shown that PAK1 drives anchorage - independent growth in human mammary epithelial cells through MAPK and MET signaling [ 80 ] . PAK1 and PAK4 also induce proliferation independent of RAF / MEK / ERK or PI3K / Akt pathways in mutant K - RAS or BRAF colon cancer cells by an unknown mechanism [ 81 ] . In the Wnt pathway , PAK1 and PAK4 directly interact and phosphorylate β - catenin , a key component of Wnt signaling [ 82 , 83 ] . Paks are also linked with the NF - κ B signaling pathway , although a direct target in this pathway has yet to be identified . Other targets of Paks include nuclear hormone receptors such as estrogen receptor ( ER ) [ 84 ] , androgen receptor ( AR ) [ 85 ] , apoptosis signaling molecules such as BAD [ 86 ] , and the E - cadherin repressor Snail [ 87 ] . There are many other Rho effectors in addition to ROCKs and Paks . Rac1 regulates components of the MAPK pathways , especially JNK and p38 . Rac1 and Cdc42 both regulate cell polarity via PAR6 . Rac1 also constitutes part of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase complex NOX2 that generates reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) . This enzyme complex consists of at least six components : two membrane - bound subunits p22 phox and gp91 phox , and four cytosolic regulatory subunits Rac1 / 2 , p47 phox , p67 phox and p40 phox . Activated Rac1 / 2 binds to p67 phox , leading to the translocation of the regulatory complex from cytosol to plasma membrane for full assembly and activation of the NOX2 complex . In addition as a host defense , ROS also activates various transcription factors such as NF - κ B , AP - 1 , HIF - 1 α and STAT3 and plays critical roles in many signaling pathways including cell - cycle progression , apoptosis , and inflammation .

Approaches to target Rho GTPase signaling Key components in the Rho GTPase pathways are attractive targets for therapeutic interventions in cancer . Rho GTPases themselves are difficult to target by small - molecule modulations . Given the micromolar GTP concentration in cells and the sub - nanomolar binding affinity of Rho GTPases for GTP or GDP , it is difficult to drug Rho GTPases by nucleotide analogs like that of protein kinases . Besides the nucleotide - binding pocket , there are few stable , tractable cavities present on Rho GTPases . Thus , the family of small GTPases , including Ras and Rho , are generally deemed “undruggable” in cancer research . A variety of bacterial toxins can modify the activity of Rho GTPases [ 88 ] . For example , the exoenzyme C3 transferase , an ADP - ribosyltransferase from Clostridium botulinum , inactivates RhoA / RhoB / RhoC , while Clostridium difficile toxin A and B glucosylate and inactivate multiple Rho GTPase subfamilies . These bacterial toxins have been widely used to dissect the biological functions of Rho GTPases . However , they are large enzymes that introduce covalent modifications to the substrates and are non - specific , therefore cannot be used clinically . Based on the biochemical mechanisms of Rho GTPase regulation and function , significant effort has been dedicated to developing small molecule inhibitors that act on various aspects of Rho GTPase signaling mechanisms ( Figure 2 ) . In this section , we discuss these strategies and representative inhibitors ( Table 2 ) . 3 . 1 Inhibition of Rho GTPase activation by RhoGEFs or prevention of Rho - GTP formation To activate Rho , Rac or Cdc42 , RhoGEFs catalyze the GDP / GTP nucleotide exchange on the Rho GTPases . As Rho GTPases are activated by different RhoGEFs that response to different signals in a temporally and spatially manner , targeting specific RhoGEFs provide better selectivity compared to targeting Rho GTPases directly . To date , however , only limited success in targeting RhoGEF activity directly has been achieved . The diversity of the sequences and domain structures beyond the shared DH - PH domains indicates the existence of diverse mechanisms for the regulation and functions of RhoGEFs . Attempts have been made to block the formation of Rho - GTP by interrupting the interactions between RhoGEFs and Rho . There are several small molecule inhibitors developed to bind Rho GTPases at the GEF - binding surface and inhibit RhoGEF function . For example , Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 was discovered through a structure - based virtual screening of compounds to fit into a surface groove of Rac1 that interacts with GEFs [ 89 ] ( Figure 3A ) . NSC23766 specifically inhibits Rac1 activation by the Rac - specific GEFs Trio or Tiam1 in a dose - dependent manner , but not Cdc42 or RhoA activation by their GEFs . Another small molecule inhibitor , CASIN , specifically inhibits Cdc42 by a similar mechanism . CASIN inhibits Cdc42 activation by its GEF intersectin in a specific , reversible and dose - dependent manner without affecting other Rho GTPases [ 90 ] . Since these Rho inhibitors target the surface of Rho GTPases that is required for activation by various GEFs , they are unlikely to be GEF - specific . Another way to target Rho GTPases activity is through targeting specific RhoGEFs and preventing their binding to Rho GTPases . Conceivably , this strategy could lead to better selectivity conferred by individual GEFs . One example is the development of inhibitors for the RhoA - specific GEF , LARG . With different screening methods , two groups Lin and Zheng Page 8 Expert Opin Drug Discov . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2016 June 18 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t independently identified several structurally distinctive inhibitors for LARG . Using a fluorescence polarization guanine nucleotide - binding assay , five compounds were identified to selectively inhibit LARG - stimulated RhoA - GTP binding [ 91 ] . Subsequently , Y16 was identified to bind to the hinge region of LARG DH / PH domain through virtual screening coupled with high throughput screen [ 92 ] ( Figure 3B ) . Y16 specifically inhibits LARG and other RGS - containing RhoGEFs by binding to RhoA without detectable effect on other Dbl family of RhoGEFs , Rho effectors , or RhoGAPs . Y16 selectively inhibits serum - induced RhoA signaling and mammary sphere formation in MCF7 breast cancer cells . Since this discovery , the inhibitors of the RhoGEF - Rho interaction are proven as useful research tools to provide experimental evidence that targeting RhoGEF to suppress Rho GTPase activation is feasible . Whether this approach will result in lead compounds with suitable potency and selectivity for clinical trials remains to be seen . In addition to the discussed competitive inhibitors , non - competitive inhibitors have been developed to inhibit Rho signaling by promoting the loss of bound nucleotide and inhibiting nucleotide re - association . These include EHT 1864 for Rac subfamily [ 93 ] and ML141 ( CID2950007 ) for Cdc42 [ 94 ] . Those compounds may function as conformation - dependent allosteric inhibitors that bind to guanine nucleotide - bound Rho GTPase , thus inducing dissociation of the bound nucleotide and locking the respective GTPase in an inactive conformation . ETH 1864 does not affect the interaction between Rac1 and its GEF Tiam1 in vitro , but inhibits nucleotide exchange induced by Tiam1 . Similarly , ML141 acts independently of effects on GEF activity or interaction with Cdc42 . 3 . 2 Stimulation of GTP - hydrolysis activity of Rho GTPases by RhoGAP RhoGAPs stimulate the intrinsic GTPase activity of RhoA , Rac and Cdc42 by up to 10 5 - fold . Our current knowledge suggests that involvement of RhoGAPs in cancer is often associated with loss - of - function mutations , and they often exhibit properties consistent with tumor suppressors . RhoGAPs are less attractive to researchers as potential targets for cancer therapy since it is difficult to develop small molecule agonists than antagonists . Further understanding of the mechanisms by which RhoGAPs are regulated in specific cellular contexts may reveal more possible approaches to target this important family of Rho GTPases regulators . Like RhoGEFs , RhoGAPs exist in large numbers and show tremendous diversity in their sequences beyond the conserved GAP catalytic domain . RhoGAPs typically contain multiple additional protein - protein and protein - lipid interacting domains , as well as many phosphorylation sites . Coordinately , RhoGEFs and RhoGAPs control Rho GTPase on / off status in a highly regulated temporal and spatial manner . It remains a challenge in the Rho GTPase field to uncover the signaling pathways by which RhoGAPs regulate specific aspects of Rho GTPase function . In particular , better understanding of which and how RhoGAPs are involved in cancer would promote the development of small molecule modulators of RhoGAPs . There is limited but promising evidence that small molecules can be used to enhance the ability of RhoGAPs to suppress Rho GTPases . One class of RhoGAPs , the Rac - specific Chimaerins ( CHN ) , has a C1 - zinc finger domain that binds the lipid second messenger diacyglycerol , a cofactor for its activity [ 95 ] . Chimaerins are implicated in development , Lin and Zheng Page 9 Expert Opin Drug Discov . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2016 June 18 .

It is speculated that small molecules that bind C1 domains may activate the GAP activities which in turn down - regulate Rac signaling . Although there are other proteins with C1 domains [ 97 ] and off - target effect could be a potential problem , C1 binding molecules may still have some degree of selectivity for a subset of C1 - containing proteins and would be a therapeutic option for Rac hyperactivation dependent cancers . 3 . 3 Inhibition of Rho - effector interaction or effector activity Approaches to target upstream Rho signaling by either blocking Rho activation through RhoGEFs or stimulating Rho intrinsic GTPase activity through RhoGAPs , are still in the early stage of development with relatively limited success . The task to modulate RhoGEFs or GAPs is a particular challenge in part due to the diversity and complexity of those upstream regulators signaling and regulation , which are still largely unclear . Another approach to block Rho signaling is by interfering the activation of effectors by Rho GTPases or inhibiting specific effector activities directly . Similar to targeting upstream signaling of Rho , higher selectivity may be achieved targeting Rho effectors . In contrast to upstream signaling pathways , downstream effector signaling pathways are much better understood . As a result , development of small molecules inhibitors against effector signaling has been more successful . Some downstream effectors are classical kinases and , therefore , are more readily targeted by traditional pharmacologic approaches . In fact , inhibitors of ROCKs , the major effector family downstream of RhoA , are most promising among all therapeutic interventions of Rho signaling for cancer therapy . ROCK inhibitors are reviewed extensively elsewhere [ 98 , 99 ] and will only be briefly discussed here . One widely used ROCK inhibitor , Y - 27632 , is a pyridine - analog that competes with ATP for binding to ROCKs [ 100 ] ( Figure 4A ) . Y - 27632 treatment decreases invasion and alters cell survival of melanoma cells in vitro resulting in a reduction in melanoma tumor volume in vivo [ 101 ] . Another extensively studied inhibitor of ROCKs is Fasudil ( also known as HA - 1077 ) , which is also ATP - competitive and inhibits a wide spectrum of kinases [ 102 ] ( Figure 4A ) . Fasudil is the only clinically approved ROCK inhibitor , initially approved for the treatment of cerebral vasospasms and pulmonary hypertension . Various animal models of cancer have revealed that Fasudil can inhibit tumor invasion and metastasis [ 103 ] . Recently developed analogs of Fasudil and Y - 27632 , with improved selectivity and potency , such as WF - 536 ( Y - 27632 derivative ) [ 104 ] , H1152 ( Fasudil derivative ) [ 105 ] , and RKI - 1447 [ 106 ] , have been shown to reduce tumor progression . Despite the great interest in ROCK for cancer therapy , no ROCK inhibitor has been approved for cancer treatment . Newer generations of ROCK inhibitors have proven more potent and selective and several are currently under clinical trials for glaucoma and ocular hypertension [ 107 - 109 ] and erectile dysfunction [ 110 ] . The multi - AGC kinase inhibitor AT13148 , which also inhibits ROCK , shows potent antitumor and anti - metastatic activities [ 111 , 112 ] and is in phase I clinical trial for advanced solid tumors . Another family of effectors that are attractive targets for drug discovery is the Pak family , downstream of both Rac and Cdc42 . Several ATP - competitive inhibitors have been Lin and Zheng Page 10 Expert Opin Drug Discov . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2016 June 18 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t identified for Paks . Earlier generations of Pak inhibitors include K252 [ 113 ] , and K252 derivative KT - D606 and CEP - 1347 [ 114 ] . Although they demonstrate potent Pak inhibition , these inhibitors are less selective and have limited utility . Later , more selective ATP - competitive Pak inhibitors were developed , such as OSU - 03012 [ 115 ] , Λ - FL172 [ 116 ] , PF - 3758309 [ 117 ] , LCH - 7749944 [ 118 ] , and FRAX597 [ 119 ] . Of them , Λ - FL172 is of particular interest ( Figure 4B ) . Λ - FL172 and related molecules were generated by modifying other compounds with bulky and rigid octahedral ruthenium scaffolds to selectively target the large ATP - binding site of PAK1 . Among 264 kinases tested , only fifteen showed an inhibition similar to that of PAK1 [ 116 ] . However , such compounds usually have poor solubility and relatively high toxicity , and their potential as clinical drugs remains to be determined . FRAX597 was a potent inhibitor of group I Paks identified from high - throughput screening and shows beneficial effects on inhibiting cancer in animal models ( Figure 4B ) . Non - ATP - competitive inhibitors have also been described . For example , IPA - 3 binds to the regulatory domain of group I Paks , locking the kinases in their auto - inhibited conformation [ 120 ] . Thereby , IPA - 3 is exceptionally selective . A few studies have shown that IPA - 3 induces apoptosis in a number of cancer cell lines [ 121 ] and decreases cell spreading and adhesion in Schwannoma cell lines [ 122 ] . However , IPA - 3 is unstable under physiological condition and unsuitable for further clinical development . In addition to directly targeting effector activities , blocking Rho GTPase - effector interactions prevents effector activation and allows for greater selectivity through targeting unique Rho GTPase interactive sites . One example is the development of small molecule inhibitor phox - I1 for p67 phox , a subunit of the NOX2 superoxide producing enzyme that is required for Rac1 - GTP binding [ 123 ] ( Figure 4C ) . Phox - I1 and derivatives recognize a surface pocket on p67 phox , disrupt Rac1 binding and effectively inhibit NOX2 - mediated superoxide production dose - dependently in human and mouse neutrophils . Although phox - I1 might not have sufficient efficacy to be used clinically , this study provides a proof of principle that inhibition of downstream effector activation by a specific pathway via rational targeting of a Rho GTPase - effector interface is a viable approach for drug development . 3 . 4 Inhibition of Rho posttranslational modification To be effective as on / off switches , Rho GTPases require proper subcellular localization to function at defined intracellular sites . The recruitment of Rho GTPase to cell membranes is mediated by post - translational modification processes as well as signaling events that release Rho - GDP from bound RhoGDI . The first and crucial step is the progressive post - translational modification of a Rho GTPase at the C - terminal “CAAX box” . A geranylgeranyl , or less frequently , a farnesyl lipid group is attached to the cysteine residue of the CAAX sequence in the cytoplasm , catalyzed by geranylgeranyl or farnesyl transferases . This allows the Rho GTPase to translocate to the ER , where the – AAX tail is cleaved off and the newly exposed α - carboxyl group of the C - terminal cysteine residue is methylesterified . Incorporation of geranylgeranyl or farnesyl group is essential for the proper localization and biological activity for most small GTPases . In contrast , the latter methylesterification is only essential for farnesylated Ras , but not geranylgenranylated Rho [ 124 ] . However , this methylesterification step may have additional functions for Rho GTPases as Lin and Zheng Page 11 Expert Opin Drug Discov . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2016 June 18 . A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase ( ICMT ) knockout resulted in greatly reduced level of RhoA [ 125 ] . Inhibitors of prenyltransferases have long been proposed as potential therapeutic drugs . There are three related enzymes of prenyltransferases : farnesyltransferase ( Ftase ) , geranylgeranyl transferase I ( GGTase I ) and GGTase II . Ftase and GGTase I recognize the CAAX motif and catalyze the lipidation of their protein substrates . GGTase II is specific for Rabs and its working mechanism is different from that of Ftase and GGTase I . Since Ras is well established as the most frequently mutated oncogene in human cancer and both normal and oncogenic Ras require farnesylation , Ftase has been one of the most attractive targets for anti - cancer drug discovery . A large number of Ftase inhibitors ( FTIs ) have been developed and tested in more than seventy clinical trials [ 126 ] . The results were largely disappointing , however , with the surprising finding that H - Ras and K - Ras can still be geranylgeranyled when Ftase is inhibited . Comparing to FTIs , less work has been done on GGTase I - specific inhibitors ( GGTIs ) . To date , several GGTIs have been developed , including inhibitors that mimic the CAAL peptide such as GGTI - 286 [ 127 ] , GGTI - 298 [ 128 ] , GGTI - 2154 [ 129 ] , and GGTI - 2166 [ 130 ] , as well as inhibitors that are non - peptidomimetic such as GGTI - Du40 [ 131 ] , P61A6 [ 132 ] , P61 - E7 [ 133 ] . P61A6 significantly suppresses tumor growth and cell proliferation in a human pancreatic cancer xenograft [ 134 ] and non - small cell lung cancer xenograft in nude mice [ 135 ] . However , PPTIs have failed to show clinical efficacy thus far [ 136 ] . 4 . Conclusions Interference of signaling from upstream regulators like RhoGEFs and RhoGAPs can impact GDP / GTP exchange or GTP hydrolysis to prevent Rho GTPases activation . Several currently available inhibitors block upstream signaling by disrupting protein - protein interactions between Rho GTPases and RhoGEFs . While RhoGAP domains have been engineered to target specific members of Rho GTPases , it remains a challenge to design chemicals that may mimic or enhance RhoGAP activity to manipulate Rho - GTP level in cells . Although RhoGDIs are proposed as potential targets in drug discovery , it is not clear if the promiscuous nature of RhoGDIs might allow for specific Rho GTPase signaling modulation . Similarly , whether targeting Rho GTPase localization through a manipulation of FTase or GGTase may satisfy selectivity and toxicity considerations . The approach of targeting Rho GTPase effectors , in particular kinases like ROCKs and PAKs , has been extensively investigated . A number of ROCK inhibitors have been developed and significant structure - activity relationship data for improving potency and selectivity are available [ 137 , 138 ] . ROCK inhibitors are currently in several clinical trials , although only AT13148 is developed for cancer therapy . The development of PAK inhibitors , however , are still in their early stage and only one has entered clinical trials [ 139 ] . Owing to their large and flexible ATP binding pocket , Paks , particular group I Paks , are difficult to target . Few Pak inhibitors with satisfactory selectivity and drug - like properties have been reported to date . More studies are needed to decipher the role of each Pak in cancer before pan - Pak or Pak isoform selective inhibitors can move to clinical trials . An alternative to inhibiting effector activity is to block effector activation by disrupting Rho / effector Lin and Zheng Page 12 Expert Opin Drug Discov .

Proof - of - principle studies have suggested a few such inhibitors . It remains to be seen if these inhibitors meet the selectivity and efficacy requirements in animal models . 5 . Expert’s Opinion Relative to Ras , Rho GTPases are considered emerging anti - cancer targets . One reason is that , while oncogenic Ras is indisputably a driver for many cancers , mutations in Rho GTPases are relatively rare in human cancers . Partly due to setbacks in strategies directly drugging Ras and the increasing understanding of Rho GTPase involvement in cancer over the last two decades , Rho GTPases have gained considerable interests as potential cancer targets . Since aberrant Rho activities associated with cancer are often caused by over - expression or dysregulation of regulators or effectors , strategies targeting Rho GTPases either directly or indirectly through other signaling pathway components have been proposed . Parallel to the continuing effort to drug Ras signaling [ 140 ] , approaches in advancing drug discovery of Rho GTPase signaling axes will enrich future cancer therapy portfolio . One of the challenges remaining is to better understand the detailed picture of Rho GTPase signaling and regulation , particularly in the context of specific cancer types . With the wide application of genome - wide analyses of cancer cells , additional evidence for aberrant Rho , GEF , GAP , and effector expression and function is expected to grow at a rapid rate . Experimental validation of their functional significance in primary cancer cells and animal models will be a rate - limiting step . Careful target validation will be key for further development of Rho pathway inhibitors for therapy . In particular because RhoGEFs and RhoGAPs are multi - domain and multi - functional , caution must be taken to more rigorously validate their roles in cancer in the context of Rho GTPase signaling . Another challenge is druggability . To date , there is no clinically available drug that targets Rho GTPase signaling for cancer treatment . Aside from a few kinase effectors which constitutes a small portion of effector portfolios , pharmacological intervention of Rho signaling by targeting Rho , Rac , Cdc42 , GEFs , Rho GTPase isoprenylation and other non - kinase effectors is still in an early stage of development . Much effort so far is proof - of - concept in nature and most academic drug leads remain far from clinical applications . Nevertheless , advances in drug design technologies , particularly those related to the design of protein - protein interaction inhibitors and high - throughput experimental assays , will accelerate the drug development process that target Rho GTPases . Rho GTPase signaling crosstalks with other cancer - associated pathways such as EGFR , PDGFR , VEGFR , G - protein coupled receptors , integrins , p53 , NF1 / NF2 , FAK , Src kinases , and Ras , constitute a complex and delicate network with multiple feedback and compensatory mechanisms . It is now generally accepted that specific targeting of a particular signaling pathway may show less efficacy and encounter rapid resistance , but drug combinations that target multiple nodal points within the network are more likely to achieve substantial clinical benefit . Even if Rho signaling inhibitors by themselves are not sufficient for effective cancer cell suppression , they may provide an option in combinatory therapy to achieve the desired efficacy . For example , the group I Pak inhibitor IPA - 3 can overcome Lin and Zheng Page 13 Expert Opin Drug Discov . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2016 June 18 .

Thus , small molecule inhibitors targeting Rho GTPase signaling may add new treatment regimens in future precision cancer therapy , particularly in combination with other anti - cancer agents .
