770 VOLUME 44 | NUMBER 7 | JULY 2012 Nature GeNetics l e t t e r s We performed a meta - analysis of five genome - wide association studies to identify common variants influencing colorectal cancer ( CRC ) risk comprising 8 , 682 cases and 9 , 649 controls . Replication analysis was performed in case - control sets totaling 21 , 096 cases and 19 , 555 controls . We identified three new CRC risk loci at 6p21 ( rs1321311 , near CDKN1A ; P = 1 . 14 × 10 −10 ) , 11q13 . 4 ( rs3824999 , intronic to POLD3 ; P = 3 . 65 × 10 −10 ) and Xp22 . 2 ( rs5934683 , near SHROOM2 ; P = 7 . 30 × 10 −10 ) This brings the number of independent loci associated with CRC risk to 20 and provides further insight into the genetic architecture of inherited susceptibility to CRC . Many colorectal cancers develop in genetically susceptible indivi­ duals , most of whom are not carriers of germline mismatch­repair or APC mutations 1 – 3 . Genome­wide association studies ( GWAS ) have validated the hypothesis that part of the heritable risk of CRC is attri­ butable to common , low­risk variants , identifying CRC susceptibility loci in 17 genomic regions 4 – 10 . The statistical power of individual GWAS is limited by the modest effect sizes of genetic variants and financial constraints on the numbers of variants that can be followed up . Meta­analysis of existing GWAS data offers the opportunity to discover additional disease loci , according to current projections for the number of independent regions harboring common variants asso­ ciated with CRC risk 11 . In this study , we conducted a meta­analysis of GWAS data and validation in multiple independent case­control series , identifying three new susceptibility loci for CRC . The discovery phase comprised five GWAS data sets from the UK population , totaling 8 , 682 cases and 9 , 649 controls ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . The Scotland1 GWAS consisted of genotyping 1 , 012 early­onset Scottish CRC cases and 1 , 012 controls using the Illumina HumanHap300 and HumanHap240S arrays ( COGS Study ) . London phase 1 ( UK1 ) was based on genotyping 940 cases with familial colorectal neoplasia and 965 controls ascertained through the Colorectal Tumour Gene Identification ( CORGI ) Consortium using Illumina HumanHap550 arrays . Scotland2 was based on an additional 2 , 057 cases and 2 , 111 controls ( Scottish color­ ectal cancer study ( SOCS ) ) , and UK2 samples comprised an additional 2 , 873 CRC cases and 2 , 871 controls ascertained through the National Study of Colorectal Cancer Genetics ( NSCCG ) . Scotland2 and UK2 samples were genotyped using Illumina Infinium­iSelect and GoldenGate arrays for a common set of 43 , 140 SNPs , including the 14 , 982 most strongly associated SNPs from UK1 , the 14 , 972 most strongly associ­ ated SNPs from Scotland1 and the 13 , 186 SNPs showing the strongest association in a joint analysis of all CRC cases and controls from both phase 1 data sets . The VQ58 GWAS comprised 1 , 800 CRC cases from the UK­based VICTOR and QUASAR2 adjuvant chemotherapy clinical trials . Victor , Quasar , 1958 Birth Cohort ( VQ58 ) cases were genotyped using the Illumina HumanHap300 and HumanHap370 arrays . The 2 , 690 controls , genotyped on the Illumina Human­1 . 2M­Duo Custom _ v1 array , were from the UK population­based 1958 Birth Cohort . Before undertaking meta­analysis of all GWAS data sets , we searched for potential biases in each case­control series ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) .

Nature GeNetics VOLUME 44 | NUMBER 7 | JULY 2012 771 l e t t e r s statistics ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) , thereby excluding the possibility of significant hidden population substructure , cryptic relatedness among subjects or differential genotype calling . Principal­component analysis showed that the cases and controls were genetically well matched ( Supplementary Fig . 3 and Supplementary Note ) . Any outliers or related individuals were excluded ( Online Methods and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . We also made use of data on 260 SNPs from 2 , 183 cases and 2 , 501 controls who had been genotyped as part of the COIN cases , National Blood Service controls ( COINNBS ) series . These SNPs had shown some evidence of association with CRC in a previous meta­analysis of the five GWAS data sets in which a smaller set of VQ cases were genotyped 8 ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Using data from the above six studies , we derived for each SNP joint odds ratios ( ORs ) and confidence intervals ( CIs ) under a fixed­effects model and determined the associated P values . We identified two SNPs , rs1321311 and rs3824999 , showing good evidence of associa­ tion ( P < 5 . 0 × 10 −5 ) and mapping to distinct loci not previously asso­ ciated with CRC risk . The P ­value threshold used does not exclude the possibility that other SNPs represent genuine association signals but was simply a pragmatic strategy for prioritizing replication . To validate our findings , we conducted a replication study of rs1321311 and rs3824999 , genotyping samples from nine additional case­control series : the Colon Cancer Family Registry ( CCFR1 ) , the UK NSCCG ( UK3 ) , the UK CORGI ( UK4 ) , an Edinburgh study ( Scotland3 ) , a Cambridge study ( Cambridge ) , a Croatian study ( Croatia ) , the Finnish Colorectal Cancer Predisposition Study ( Helsinki ) and a Swedish study ( Sweden ) , together with a Japanese study ( Japan ) ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . In the combined analysis , both rs1321311 ( P = 1 . 14 × 10 −10 ; P het = 0 . 55 , I 2 = 0 % ) and rs3824999 ( P = 3 . 65 × 10 −10 ; P het = 0 . 05 , I 2 = 41 % ) showed evidence for an association with CRC at genome­wide significance ( P < 5 . 0 × 10 −8 ) ( Table 1 , Online Methods and Supplementary Table 2 ) . rs3824999 maps to 11q13 . 4 at position 74 , 023 , 198 within intron 9 of the POLD3 gene ( encoding polymerase DNA­directed δ 3 ; MIM 611415 ; Fig . 1 ) . The POLD3 protein is a component of the DNA polymerase – δ complex that comprises proliferating cell nuclear anti­ gen ( PCNA ) , the multi­subunit replication factor C and the four­ subunit polymerase complex . As well as being involved in suppression of homologous recombination , the DNA polymerase – δ complex par­ ticipates in DNA mismatch and base­excision repair , key processes shown to be defective in Mendelian CRC susceptibility disorders 12 . rs1321311 maps to 6p21 at position 36 , 730 , 878 within a region of linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) that encompasses the CDKN1A gene ( encoding cyclin­dependent kinase inhibitor 1A ; MIM 116899 ; Fig . 1 ) . Notably , rs1321311 has been shown to be associated with electro­ cardiographic QRS duration 13 . CDKN1A encodes p21 WAF1 / Cip1 , which mediates p53­dependent G1 growth arrest 14 . Moreover , p21 acts as a master effector of multiple tumor suppressor pathways that function independently of classical p53 tumor suppression . Also , by binding to PCNA , p21 interferes with PCNA­dependent DNA polymerase activity , thereby inhibiting DNA replication and modulating PCNA­ dependent DNA repair 14 . Through binding to PCNA , p21 also com­ petes for PCNA binding with DNA polymerase – δ and several other proteins involved in DNA synthesis , thus directly inhibiting DNA syn­ thesis 14 . Similarly , p21 represses MYC­dependent transcription and , in turn , MYC disrupts the PCNA­p21 interaction , thus alleviating p21­dependent inhibition of PCNA and DNA synthesis 14 . Decreased p21 expression has been reported to be a feature of dysplastic aber­ rant crypt foci in colonic mucosa and adenomas . The finding that p21 downregulation inversely correlates with microsatellite instability ( MSI ) status in CRC , irrespective of p53 status , again invokes a rela­ tionship with defective DNA repair and genomic instability 14 . Including the two newly discovered SNPs , a total of 19 independ­ ent risk SNPs for CRC have been identified , all mapping to auto­ somal regions of the genome . The risk of sporadic CRC is higher for males in both economically developed and less­developed countries . Furthermore , males are at greater overall risk for CRC and have an earlier age of onset for Lynch syndrome 15 – 17 . It is possible that some of these differences in risk are attributable to sex chromosome genetic variation . To explore this hypothesis , we studied the relationship between SNPs mapping to the sex­specific region of the X chromo­ some and CRC risk . Genotypes were analyzed using an extension to the standard Cochran­Armitage test for trend 18 ( Online Methods ) . rs5934683 was the only SNP that showed strong evidence of asso­ ciation in the meta­analysis of the UK1 , UK2 , Scotland1 , Scotland2 and VQ58 data sets . We also genotyped rs5934683 in the UK3 , Scotland3 , UK4 , CCFR1 , Cambridge , Croatia , Helsinki , Sweden and Japan studies ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . In combined analysis , rs5934683 showed evidence for an association with CRC at genome­ wide significance ( P = 7 . 30 × 10 −10 , P het = 0 . 31 , I 2 = 13 % ; Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2 ) . rs5934683 maps to Xp22 . 2 within a 43­kb region of LD ( position 9 , 711 , 474 ; Fig . 1 ) . Two genes map to this region , GPR143 ( encoding G protein – coupled receptor 143 ; MIM 300808 ) , which is expressed by melanocytes and retinal pigment epithelium , and SHROOM2 ( encod­ ing shroom family member 2 ; MIM 300103 ) , a human homolog of the Xenopus laevis APX gene . rs5934683 is situated between GPR143 and SHROOM2 and seems to be within the distal promoter region of SHROOM2 . There is also evidence of longer , less­abundant GPR143 transcripts extending into the SHROOM2 promoter . SHROOM2 is known to have broad roles in cell morphogenesis during endothelial and epithelial tissue development 19 . Missense mutations in SHROOM2 have been detected in large­scale screens for recurrent mutations in cancer cell lines 20 . Like GPR143 , SHROOM2 regulates melanosome biogenesis and localization in the retinal pigment epithelium 21 . Notably , abnormal retinal pigmentation , similar to the congenital hypertrophy of retinal pigment epithelium ( CHRPE ) lesions that are a component of the familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome , has previously been shown to be an extracolonic feature of non­FAP CRC 22 , 23 . To our knowledge , the relationship between Xp22 . 2 and CRC risk represents the first evidence for the role of X­chromosome variation in predisposition to a non – sex specific cancer . table 1 summary results for the sNPs rs1321311 ( 6p21 ) , rs3824999 ( 11q13 . 4 ) and rs5934683 ( Xp22 . 2 ) associated with CrC risk SNP Study OR 95 % CI P value rs1321311 Discovery 1 . 09 1 . 05 – 1 . 14 4 . 79 × 10 −5 Replication 1 . 09 1 . 05 – 1 . 14 5 . 74 × 10 −6 Japan 1 . 18 1 . 03 – 1 . 36 1 . 71 × 10 −2 Combined 1 . 10 1 . 07 – 1 . 13 1 . 14 × 10 −10 ( P het = 0 . 55 , I 2 = 0 % ) rs3824999 Discovery 1 . 08 1 . 05 – 1 . 13 1 . 77 × 10 −5 Replication 1 . 07 1 . 04 – 1 . 11 2 . 06 × 10 −5 Japan 1 . 09 0 . 99 – 1 . 19 8 . 46 × 10 −2 Combined 1 . 08 1 . 05 – 1 . 10 3 . 65 × 10 −10 ( P het = 0 . 05 , I 2 = 41 % ) rs5934683 Discovery 1 . 08 1 . 04 – 1 . 12 8 . 19 × 10 −5 Replication 1 . 07 1 . 04 – 1 . 10 2 . 16 × 10 −6 Japan 1 . 04 0 . 93 – 1 . 16 5 . 38 × 10 −1 Combined 1 . 07 1 . 04 – 1 . 10 7 . 30 × 10 −10 ( P het = 0 . 31 , I 2 = 13 % ) n p g © 2012 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c .

After adjusting for multiple testing , we did not find any significant association . To analyze comprehensively the associations at 6p21 , 11q13 . 4 and Xp22 . 2 , we imputed genotypes in GWAS cases and controls using HapMap 3 and 1000 Genomes Project data for the autosomal regions and HapMap release 21 for Xp22 . 2 ( Fig . 1 and Online Methods ) . We did not find substantive evidence of stronger associations at the 6p21 . 2 and Xp22 . 2 risk loci . However , at the 11q13 . 4 locus , rs72977282 , mapping 3 , 188 bp 5 ′ to POLD3 , was more strongly asso­ ciated with CRC than rs3824999 ( Fig . 1 and Supplementary Table 4 ) . No nonsynonymous SNPs showing strong LD ( r 2 > 0 . 4 , D ′ > 0 . 8 ) with rs1321311 , rs3824999 or rs5934683 at 6p21 , 11q13 . 4 and Xp22 . 2 loci , respectively , were identified . These data indicate that it is likely that the associations between 6p21 , 11q13 . 4 and Xp22 . 2 , and CRC risk are mediated through changes that influence gene expression rather than protein sequence . To examine whether any directly genotyped or imputed SNPs lie within or very close to a putative transcription factor – binding and / or enhancer element , we conducted a bioinformatics search using Transfac 24 , ENCyclopedia of DNA Elements ( ENCODE ) CHIP­Seq and ENCODE UW DNAaseI Hypersensitivity data . These analyses did not provide evidence that rs1321311 , rs3824999 or rs5934683 , or any closely correlated SNP maps to a known or predicted region of transcriptional regulation ( Supplementary Table 4 ) . To explore whether the rs1321311 , rs3824999 and rs5934683 asso­ ciations ( or those of proxy SNPs ) reflect cis ­acting regulatory effects on POLD3 , CDKN1A , GPR143 or SHROOM2 , we conducted expres­ sion studies using Illumina HT­12 arrays with RNA extracted from 42 samples of normal colonic epithelium ( Supplementary Table 5 ) . We also analyzed publicly available mRNA expression data from fibro­ blasts , lymphoblastoid cell lines ( LCLs ) , T cells , adipose tissue and CRCs 25 , 26 ( Supplementary Table 5 ) . In silico analysis revealed a statis­ tically significant relationship between the genotype at rs1321311 and expression of CDKN1A . However , this was observed only in LCL and T­cell data , with no evidence of an effect in the colon ( Supplementary Table 5 ) . We also found that the risk allele at rs5934683 was asso­ ciated with a marked reduction in SHROOM2 expression in both normal colonic epithelium and CRC tissue ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . The relationship between SHROOM2 expression in normal colonic epithelium and rs5934683 genotype was very strong ( P = 1 . 3 × 10 −7 ) and was significant after accounting for all genes tested on the HT­12 array ( P = 9 . 0 × 10 −4 ) . Indeed , rs5934683 genotype accounted for 55 % of the variation in SHROOM2 expression . Exploring the relation­ ship between SHROOM2 expression , rs5934683 risk genotype and CRC causation will be of considerable interest , not least because of the observations of an association between excess pigmented lesions in the retinal pigment epithelium and CRC 22 , 23 . There was no signi­ ficant difference in the observed minor allele frequency ( MAF ) of rs5934683 between female and male cases , raising the possibility that skewed X­chromosome inactivation might underscore the associated CRC risk . Favored X­chromosome inactivation producing a normal phenotype has been documented in X­linked dominant disease 27 , and skewed X­chromosome inactivation has been implicated as a risk factor for breast cancer 28 . The expression data were consistent with full dosage compensation , but , due to sample and effect sizes , we are currently unable to confirm or refute a dosage effect on risk . There was no detectable relationship between rs3824999 and POLD3 expression in any of the expression studies . It should be noted that these exploratory analyses could only detect > 5 % differences in RNA expression by genotype with 80 % power at a single time point , and , hence , we could not exclude any subtle effects of genotype on target tissues relevant to CRC . By pooling GWAS data and conducting extensive replica­ tion analyses , we have identified three new loci influencing CRC susceptibility . The loci are of modest effect size , which is not unex­ pected , given that common alleles with a larger impact on CRC were likely to have been discovered in previous studies . Although addi­ tional analyses are required to determine the functional consequences that lead to CRC , our findings highlight the importance of variation in genes encoding components of the p21 WAF1 / Cip1 signaling path­ way in CRC . This pathway , elucidated through the extended inter­ action network of CDKN1A , incorporates not only POLD3 , which was discovered as a CRC risk locus here , but also MYC and other genes ( including SMADs and other transforming growth factor ( TGF ) - β pathway genes ) that we have previously identified as risk factors for CRC .

Nature GeNetics doi : 10 . 1038 / ng . 2293 oNLINe MeThods Ethics statement . Collection of blood samples and clinicopathological information from subjects was undertaken with informed consent and ethical review board approval at all sites in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki . Data sets , sample preparation and genotyping . Full details of each data set are provided in the Supplementary Note . DNA was extracted from samples using conventional methods and quanti­ fied using PicoGreen ( Invitrogen ) . The VQ , UK1 and Scotland1 GWAS cohorts were genotyped using Illumina Hap300 , Hap240S , Hap370 or Hap550 arrays . The 1958BC and NBS samples were genotyped as part of the WTCCC2 study on Hap1 . 2M­Duo Custom arrays . The CCFR1 samples were genotyped using Illumina Hap1M or Hap1M­Duo arrays . In UK2 and Scotland2 , genotyp­ ing was conducted using custom Illumina Infinium arrays , according to the manufacturer’s protocols . Some SNPs from COIN samples were genotyped on custom Illumina GoldenGate arrays . To ensure quality of genotyping , a series of duplicate samples was genotyped , resulting in 99 . 9 % concordant calls in all cases . Other genotyping was conducted using competitive allele­specific PCR KASPar chemistry ( KBiosciences ) , TaqMan ( Life Sciences ) or MassARRAY ( Sequenom ) . Details of all primers , probes and conditions used are avail­ able upon request . Genotyping quality control was tested using duplicate DNA samples within studies and SNP assays , together with direct sequencing of subsets of samples to confirm genotyping accuracy . For all SNPs , > 99 % concordant results were obtained . Quality control and sample exclusion . We excluded SNPs from analysis if they failed one or more of the following tests : GenCall scores of < 0 . 25 ; overall call rates of < 95 % ; MAF of < 0 . 01 ; departure from Hardy­Weinberg equilibrium ( HWE ) in controls at P < 1 × 10 −4 or in cases at P < 1× 10 −6 ; outliers in terms of signal intensity or X : Y ratio ; showed discordance between duplicate samples ; or , for SNPs with evidence of association , poor clustering on inspection of X : Y plots . We excluded individuals from analysis if they failed one or more of the following tests : duplication or cryptic relatedness to estimated identity by descent ( IBD ) of > 6 . 25 % ; overall successfully genotyped SNPs of < 95 % ; mismatch between predicted and reported gender ; outliers in a plot of het­ erozygosity versus missingness ; and evidence of non­European ancestry in principal­components analysis – based testing in comparison with HapMap sam­ ples . Details of all sample exclusions are provided ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . To identify individuals who might have non­northern European ances­ try , we merged our case and control data from all sample sets with the 60 European ( CEU ) , 60 Nigerian ( YRI ) and 90 Japanese ( JPT ) and 90 Han Chinese ( CHB ) individuals from the International HapMap Project . For each pair of individuals , we calculated genome­wide identity­by­state distances on the basis of markers shared between HapMap 2 and our SNP panel and used these as dissimilarity measures upon which to perform principal­components analysis . Principal­components analysis was performed in R using CEU , YRI and HCB HapMap samples as references . The first two principal com­ ponents for each individual were plotted , and any individual not present in the main CEU cluster ( > 5 % of the principal­component distance from the HapMap CEU cluster centroid ) was excluded from subsequent analyses ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . We had previously shown the adequacy of the case­control matching and possibility of differential genotyping of cases and controls using quantile­ quantile plots of test statistics . The inflation factor λ GC was calculated by divid­ ing the mean of the lower 90 % of the test statistics by the mean of the lower 90 % of the expected values from a χ 2 distribution with 1 degree of freedom . Deviation of the genotype frequencies in the controls from those expected under HWE was assessed by χ 2 test ( 1 degree of freedom ) or by Fisher’s exact test , where the expected cell count was < 5 . Statistical and bioinformatic analysis . Main analyses were undertaken using R ( v2 . 6 ) , STATA v . 11 and PLINK ( v1 . 06 ) software 29 . The association between each SNP and risk of CRC was assessed by the Cochran­Armitage trend test . ORs and associated 95 % CIs were calculated by unconditional logistic regres­ sion . Meta­analysis was conducted using standard methods 30 . Cochran’s Q statistic to test for heterogeneity 30 and the I 2 statistic to quantify the proportion of the total variation due to heterogeneity were calculated 31 . I 2 values of ≥ 75 % are considered characteristic of large heterogeneity 31 , 32 . Associations by sex , age and clinicopathological phenotypes were examined by logistic regression in case­only analyses . For SNPs on the non­pseudoautosomal region of the X chromosome , males carry only one copy , and , in females , most loci are subject to X inactivation 33 . To test for X­chromosome associations , we used an extension to the standard 1­degree­of­freedom Cochran­Armitage test for trend 18 whereby males can be regarded as homozygous females . This 1­degree­of­freedom trend test adjusts for the different variances for males and females . Prediction of the ungenotyped SNPs was carried out using IMPUTEv2 , based on HapMap Phase 3 haplotypes , release 2 ( HapMap Data Release 27 , phase 3 , February 2009 , on NCBI Build 36 assembly , dbSNP26 ) and 1000 Genomes Project data . Imputation of the X­chromosome loci was only possible using IMPUTEv1 with HapMap Data Release 21 on NCBI Build 35 . Imputed data were analyzed using SNPTEST v2 to account for uncertainties in SNP prediction . An imputation info score of 0 . 95 was used to remove SNPs with poor imputation quality . LD metrics between HapMap SNPs were based on Data Release 27 , phase 3 ( February 2009 ) , on NCBI Build 36 assembly , dbSNP26 , viewed using Haploview software ( v4 . 2 ) and plotted using SNAP . LD blocks were defined on the basis of HapMap recombination rate , as defined using the Oxford recombination hotspots 34 and on the basis of distribution of confidence intervals as defined 35 . To annotate potential regulatory sequences within disease loci , we implemented in silico searches using Transfac Matrix Database v7 . 29 ( ref . 24 ) and PReMod10 ( ref . 36 ) software . We used the in silico algorithms SIFT and PolyPhen to predict the impact of amino­acid substitutions . Relationship between SNP genotype and mRNA expression . Expression studies in colonic epithelium . To examine for a relationship between SNP genotype and mRNA expression in colonic epithelium , 42 samples were collected fresh immediately after surgical resection of specimens for colorectal cancer ( n = 34 ) , solitary adenoma ( n = 5 ) or benign conditions ( not inflammatory bowel disease ) ( n = 3 ) . For 2 of the 42 subjects , 3 samples of mucosa were harvested from different locations of the fresh resected bowel . Normal epithelium was dissected from muscularis propria , and samples were snap frozen and placed in RNAlater ( Applied Biosystems ) and kept at 4 °C overnight before storage at −80 °C . Tissue was disrupted and homogenized using TissueLyser LT ( Qiagen ) , and RNA was extracted using the Ribopure kit ( Applied Biosystems ) . RNA integrity and concentration were assessed on an Agilent Bioanalyzer , and RNA purity ( A260 / A280 and A260 / A230 ) was assessed by Nanodrop . RT­PCR products were analyzed on HumanHT­12 Expression BeadChips , which were scanned using Illumina HiScan . Array data processing and analysis were performed using Illumina GenomeStudio software ( version 2011 . 1 ) . Microarray data were exported from Illumina BeadStudio software , processed and normalized using the R Bioconductor beadarray and limma packages 37 , 38 . Before normalization , probes that were not detected ( detection P value > 0 . 01 ) on the microarrays were removed . Microarrays were quantile normalized to remove technical variation . Three mucosal samples were available for 2 of the 42 subjects , and , for these , we used the average signal of the replicates in the analysis . The limma package was used to find differentially expressed genes , using the functions lmFit , eBayes and topTable . To test all associations between SNPs and expression , a linear model was fitted to the expression level of each probe , using this genotype value as effect . For SNP associations with gene expression on the X chromosome , gender was added to the model . Significant associations were considered as < 0 . 05 , using P values adjusted for multiple testing with the Benjamini­ Hochberg method from R’s p . adjust function . In silico analysis of publicly available expression data . We analyzed expression data generated from ( i ) fibroblasts , lymphoblastoid cell lines ( LCLs ) and T cells derived from the umbilical cords of 75 Geneva GenCord individuals 25 ; ( ii ) 166 adipose , 156 LCL and 160 skin samples derived from a subset of healthy female twins of the MuTHER resource 26 using Sentrix Human­6 Expression BeadChips ( Illumina ) 39 , 40 ; and ( iii ) AgilentG4502A _ 07 _ 3 custom gene expres­ sion data on 154 CRCs obtained as part of the Cancer Genome Atlas project . Power of assays to establish a relationship between genotype and expression was evaluated using STATA software . n p g © 2012 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . Nature GeNetics doi : 10 . 1038 / ng . 2293 Assignment of microsatellite instability in colorectal cancers . Tumor MSI status in CRCs was determined using the mononucleotide microsatellite loci BAT25 and BAT26 , which are highly sensitive MSI markers . Briefly , 10­mm sections were cut from formalin­fixed paraffin­embedded CRC tumors and lightly stained with toluidine blue , and regions containing at least 60 % tumor were microdissected . Tumor DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Mini kit ( Qiagen ) , according to the manufacturer’s instructions , and genotyped for the BAT25 and BAT26 loci using either [ 32 P ] ­labeled or fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide primers ( in the UK2­UK3 and COINNBS studies , respec­ tively ) . Samples showing at least five novel alleles compared to normal DNA at either or both markers were assigned as MSI­high ( MSI­H ) 41 . 29 . Purcell , S . et al .
