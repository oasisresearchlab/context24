In this bien - nial update , we present our new chemical – phenotype module that codes chemical - induced effects on phe - notypes , curated using controlled vocabularies for chemicals , phenotypes , taxa , and anatomical de - scriptors ; this module provides unique opportuni - ties to explore cellular and system - level phenotypes of the pre - disease state and allows users to con - struct predictive adverse outcome pathways ( link - ing chemical – gene molecular initiating events with phenotypic key events , diseases , and population - level health outcomes ) . We also report a 46 % in - crease in CTD manually curated content , which when integrated with other datasets yields more than 38 million toxicogenomic relationships . We de - scribe new querying and display features for our en - hanced chemical – exposure science module , provid - ing greater scope of content and utility . As well , we discuss an updated MEDIC disease vocabulary with over 1700 new terms and accession identiﬁers . To accommodate these increases in data content and functionality , CTD has upgraded its computational infrastructure . These updates continue to improve CTD and help inform new testable hypotheses about the etiology and mechanisms underlying environ - mentally inﬂuenced diseases . INTRODUCTION The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database ( CTD ; http : / / ctdbase . org / ) is a premier public resource that advances understanding about chemical exposures and human health ( 1 – 5 ) . We use novel biocuration paradigms ( 6 ) to curate dis - parate data for toxicogenomics ( 7 – 10 ) , phenotypes ( 11 – 12 ) , diseases ( 11 , 13 – 16 ) , environmental exposures ( 17 – 20 ) , and pharmaceuticals ( 11 , 21 ) . Professional biocurators manu - ally curate the scientific literature , transforming text , ta - bles , figures and supplemental files into annotated data that is seamlessly integrated and available through CTD’s pub - lic web application ( PWA ) . This process , using a suite of community - accepted controlled vocabularies and ontolo - gies with accession identifiers , ensures CTD content is co - hesive , manageable , and computable , as well as adhering to the FAIR principle , allowing the information to be Find - able , Accessible , Interoperable and Reusable ( 22 ) . Addition - ally , all CTD interactions are embellished with taxa identi - fication ( enabling data to be compared across species , from model laboratory organisms to humans ) and are directly linked to the original source article ( providing full trans - parency and traceability ) . Furthermore , CTD maintains good data stewardship with the digital informatics commu - nity by facilitating semantic standards for the environmen - tal health science community ( 23 ) , complying with report - ing standards set by the BioSharing Information Resources ( 24 ) , and registering with BioDBcore ( https : / / biosharing . org / biodbcore - 000173 ) ( 25 ) and the NAR Molecular Bi - ology Database Collection ( http : / / www . oxfordjournals . org / our journals / nar / database / summary / 1188 ) . Here , we provide our biennial database update and de - scribe our newly released chemical – phenotype module , ad - vanced query and display tools for exposure science data , an extensive update to the MEDIC disease vocabulary and an overall increase in manually curated content .

NEW FEATURES Increased data content It is prudent for databases to update their content rou - tinely to stay relevant and to keep pace with scientific ad - vances . As of August 2018 , CTD includes over 2 . 3 mil - lion manually curated chemical – gene , chemical – phenotype , chemical – disease , gene – disease and chemical – exposure in - teractions for 15 681 chemicals , 46 689 genes , 4340 pheno - types and 7212 diseases ( Table 1 ) , representing a 46 % in - crease in content since our last update ( 5 ) . These interac - tions are manually curated from 129 564 peer - reviewed sci - entific articles , triaged from PubMed using targeted jour - nal queries to enhance data currency ( 26 ) and chemical - centric queries and text - mining to improve data complete - ness and increase curatorial efficiency and productivity ( 27 ) . This workflow keeps CTD both relevant and up - to - date with the toxicology and exposure literature , as new content is added every month ( http : / / ctdbase . org / about / dataStatus . go ) ; as well , CTD’s controlled vocabularies and curated content are described and made freely available for users to download in a variety of formats ( . csv , . obo , . tsv and . xml ) at ‘Data Downloads’ ( http : / / ctdbase . org / downloads / ) . Internal integration of these direct interactions ( 9 ) gen - erates > 24 million gene – disease and 2 . 2 million chemical – disease predictive inferences that are statistically ranked ( 28 ) . External integration of CTD content with annota - tions from Gene Ontology ( 29 ) , KEGG ( 30 ) , Reactome ( 31 ) and BioGRID ( 32 ) produces an additional 9 . 4 million in - ferences ( Table 1 ) . In total , CTD includes over 38 million toxicogenomic relationships for analysis and hypothesis de - velopment , and was recently named a ‘golden set database’ that serves as an ‘authoritative , comprehensive , and con - venient data resource’ ( 33 ) . This repute is corroborated by > 1500 citations to CTD ( including over 730 since 2016 ) and by 100 external databases now incorporating or linking to CTD content ( http : / / ctdbase . org / about / publications / # use ) . New CTD chemical – phenotype module While CTD has been curating chemical - induced diseases since 2007 ( 1 ) , many toxicology articles do not report a dis - ease as an endpoint , but rather describe molecular , cellu - lar , or physiological systems that are altered , such as sig - nal transduction , cell proliferation , apoptosis , and immune system processes . To curate these important non - disease events , we developed a new module that codes chemical - induced phenotypes ( 12 ) . At CTD , we operationally dis - tinguish phenotypes from diseases : if the reported outcome exists in CTD’s MEDIC disease vocabulary ( 15 ) , we con - sider it a disease ; subsequently , any outcome not in MEDIC is considered de facto a phenotype and is coded in our new module . CTD chemical - induced phenotypes are cu - rated in a structured format using controlled vocabular - ies and include six components ( chemical , action qualifier , phenotype entity , taxon , anatomy and PubMed reference ) as well as an inference network ( Figure 1 ) . For phenotype curation , we co - opted the Gene Ontology ( GO ) as a vo - cabulary source for non - disease biological outcomes ; this has proven remarkably successful since most of the phe - notypes reported in the toxicology literature already exist as a controlled term in the GO , and GO is a well - known , community - accepted vocabulary with accession identifiers , allowing novel CTD chemical – phenotype interactions to be computable and interoperable with other databases . Ad - ditionally , CTD chemical – phenotype interactions are en - hanced with an organism term from NCBI Taxonomy ( 34 ) and anatomical descriptions from Medical Subject Head - ings ( MeSH ) ‘Anatomy’ [ A ] branch ( 35 ) . Chemical – phenotype interactions are reciprocally dis - played on CTD Chemical pages ( under the ‘Phenotypes’ data - tab ; Figure 1 ) and on CTD GO pages ( under the ‘Chemical Interactions’ data - tab ) . The Inference Network automatically computes a list of genes that have both a di - rectly curated chemical – gene interaction in CTD and are independently annotated to the same GO term by external databases ( 36 , 37 ) . The Inference Network identifies poten - tial molecular networks that connect the chemical to the phenotype by finding common genes from two completely independent curated datasets . Users can find a quick guide about the phenotype module by clicking the Help icon ( ‘ ? ’ ) on the webpage ( Figure 1 ) . CTD chemical – phenotype interactions provide numer - ous discovery opportunities for users . They allow pheno - types to be explored easily from a chemical perspective ( e . g . bisphenol A ) or a phenotype perspective ( e . g . apopto - sis ) , providing insight into mechanistic connections across species and anatomical tissues ( Figure 2A ) . As well , by con - necting accession identifiers for hierarchical terms to both the CTD chemical environment and GO phenotypes ( Fig - ure 2B ) , these interactions help address the community’s need to link phenotypes to the environment and make the information computable for meta - analyses and discovery ( 37 ) . Third , CTD chemical – phenotype data complements D950 Nucleic Acids Research , 2019 , Vol . 47 , Database issue Figure 1 . CTD’s new phenotype module . CTD’s chemical – phenotype curation paradigm collects novel information for chemically induced non - disease outcomes across species , with hyperlinked terms to allow seamless navigation across CTD . chemical – phenotype interactions are displayed under the new ‘Phenotypes’ data - tab on chemical pages ( and vice versa under the new ‘Chemical Interactions’ data - tab on GO / Phenotype pages ) . Interactions are curated in a structured format using controlled vocabularies for chemicals ( C ) , phenotype entities ( E ) , action qualifiers ( Q , ‘increased’ , ‘decreased’ , or ‘affects’ ) , organisms ( T ) and anatomy ( A ) , and are directly traceable to the source article ( P ) . Additionally , Inference Networks list a set of genes that provide a putative molecular framework to connect the chemical to the phenotype . Here , the insecticide rotenone affects several phenotypes , including ‘membrane organization’ in a human neural tumor cell line ; as well , rotenone directly interacts with 18 genes in CTD that are also independently annotated to the same GO term , forming an inference network . The Help icon ( ‘ ? ’ ) provides users with a link to a concise guide about the phenotype module . For simplicity , an edited screenshot is shown . the myriad of well - established gene – phenotype modules from other databases , and integration ( via numerous shared accession IDs ) enables model organism gene - phenotype in - formation to be brought into the chemical exposure en - vironment provided by CTD ( Figure 2C ) . Furthermore , combining CTD’s chemical – phenotype data with CTD’s chemical – disease data allows phenotypes to be inferred to diseases ( via shared chemicals ) to provide insight into potentially presymptomatic conditions of a disease ( Fig - ure 2D ) . This integration connects sub - cellular phenotypes shared by different diseases , potentially informing earlier diagnosis and new therapeutic strategies ( 16 ) . Finally , inte - grating all four CTD curation modules can be used to com - pute predictive adverse outcome pathways ( AOP ) , which depict toxicant - induced events affecting human health in a series of interoperable modular graphs ( 38 ) . CTD’s four curation projects mirror the four components of an AOP : CTD’s toxicogenomic core includes the chemical – gene in - teractions that correspond to molecular initiating events ( MIE ) , CTD’s chemical – phenotype interactions describe key events ( KE ) in the pathway , CTD’s disease core reports chemical - and gene - induced adverse outcomes ( AO ) , and our exposure module relates exposure stressor - induced ef - fects at the population level ( PO ) . Integrating CTD con - tent can help quickly generate predictive AOPs for anal - ysis , information discovery , and testing ( Figure 2E ) , as we demonstrated in building predictive AOPs describing arsenic - mediated MIEs for 39 genes affecting ten glucose - related metabolic KEs prior to the onset of a diabetic AO , as well as ten predictive AOPs for cadmium - induced phe - notypes ( cell signaling cascades , neuronal apoptosis and al - Nucleic Acids Research , 2019 , Vol . 47 , Database issue D951 Figure 2 . Using chemical – phenotype data for discovery . ( A ) Users can explore phenotypes from a chemical perspective ( e . g . bisphenol A influences 410 phenotypes in 171 anatomical sites from 34 species ) as well as discover chemicals that affect a specific phenotype ( e . g . apoptotic process is modulated by 2 , 251 chemicals in 55 species ) . ( B ) Use of hierarchical controlled vocabularies ( with accession identifiers ) for both chemicals ( MESH : ID ) and phenotypes ( GO : ID ) provides data files that allow environmental factors and phenotypes to be linked and computable for meta - analyses . ( C ) Use of interoperable accession identifiers for genes ( G ) , phenotypes ( P ) , taxa ( T ) , and diseases ( D ) shared by model organism databases ( MODs ) and other resources enable their content to be integrated with and brought into the chemical environment of CTD . ( D ) Non - disease phenotypes can be inferred to diseases ( based on shared interacting chemicals ) to help inform the pre - disease state . The heavy metal copper modulates 132 phenotypes and , independently , is associated with 139 diseases in CTD , providing a view of the potential biological processes in the presymptomatic condition , such as the numerous oxidative stress phenotypes that might precede the onset of neurological diseases . This knowledge can be leveraged to find novel commonalities between sets of phenotypes anddiversediseases , withthepotentialofre - purposingordiscoveringnewtherapeuticdrugs . ( E ) IntegratingdatafromallfourCTDmoduleshelpsgenerate predictive adverse outcome pathways ( AOP ) . CTD’s toxicogenomic core reports chemical – gene ( C – G ) interactions that parallel the molecular initiating event ( MIE ) of an AOP , CTD’s new phenotype module links chemical – non - disease phenotype ( C – P ) key events ( KE ) , disease core curates chemical – disease ( C – D ) and gene – disease ( G – D ) adverse outcomes ( AO ) , and CTD’s exposure module relates chemical exposures ( C - Ex ) for population - level health outcomes ( PO ) . tered learning and memory ) that may precede Alzheimer disease ( 12 ) . chemical – phenotype interactions can also be explored using a new chemical – phenotype Interaction Query ( http : / / ctdbase . org / query . go ? type = phenotype ) . This allows users to perform advanced searches based not only on chemicals and phenotypes , but also the hierarchical controlled terms for anatomy and organisms . Thus , a researcher interested in nephrotoxicity can search the Anatomy field with the word ‘kidney’ to retrieve over 9 , 300 interactions for more than 1100 chemicals affecting 510 phenotypes in 17 renal struc - tures from 30 species ( http : / / bit . ly / ctdkidneyphenotype ) . Increased content , utility , and functionality of exposure sci - ence data In 2015 , CTD launched the first comprehensive , literature - based , manually curated exposure science module that cen - tralized and harmonized environmental science data from diverse research studies by using controlled vocabularies for chemical stressors , receptor demographics , biomarkers , ex - posure outcomes , and geographical locations , among other data types ( 18 , 19 ) . This module is fully integrated within the CTD framework , connecting real - world measurements for environmental toxicants and biomarkers with laboratory - derived toxicogenomic data . Since our last update , we have improved the utility of this module in three important ways . D952 Nucleic Acids Research , 2019 , Vol . 47 , Database issue First , as mentioned ( Table 1 ) , the content has dramat - ically increased to 122 725 chemical – exposure statements ( 74 % increase ) . These statements are curated from 2150 ar - ticles and relate exposure data for 1155 chemical stressors , 432 human genes , 421 environmental diseases and 332 phe - notypes . Second , we enhanced the functionality of the Expo - sure Studies query page ( http : / / ctdbase . org / query . go ? type = expStudies ) by including two additional search parameters . A user can now add Study Factors to screen for 11 entities affecting the conclusions of an exposure study , such as diet , age , race , socioeconomic status , etc . The additional query field Associated Study Titles allows selection of curated ar - ticles from a common cohort , with over 415 projects alpha - betically listed ( from the Aarhus Birth Cohort of Denmark to the Wuhan - Zhuhai Cohort of China ) . In exposure sci - ence , large , cooperative , multi - year projects and datasets are often given a study title and acronym . The integration of study titles helps users to identify and collate articles de - rived from a project ( often published over many years by different groups in various journals ) , and enables users to conduct meta - analyses across many publications , as CTD previously demonstrated with the Agriculture Health Study ( 18 ) . Data from the National Health and Nutrition Ex - amination Survey ( NHANES ) are extensively used in di - verse exposure analyses . Currently , CTD has over 175 ar - ticles curated with NHANES - related data , and users can quickly peruse them by using the Associated Study Titles search parameter ( http : / / bit . ly / ctdnhanes ) . Alternatively , a researcher interested in the Center for the Health Assess - ment of Mothers and Children of Salinas ( CHAMACOS ) can retrieve the many articles reporting data from this birth cohort study of pesticides ( http : / / bit . ly / ctdchamacos ) . In - corporating study titles as part of CTD’s exposure mod - ule is a simple but highly effective way to associate dis - parate publications , and users now can leverage this func - tionality as a new search parameter . Both of these new data fields are also included in the freely available , sim - plified view of the ‘Exposure - study associations’ data file ( http : / / ctdbase . org / downloads / # exposurestudies ) . Finally , we expanded the display content of ‘Exposure Details’ from 14 to 33 data fields and adapted the view mode to be customizable by the user ( 19 ) . Initially , the four con - tent areas of exposure curation ( Stressor , Receptor , Event , and Outcome ) displayed basic details such as the chemi - cal stressor , description of receptors , biomarker term , mea - sured levels , and disease or phenotype outcome . Though additional data fields were collected at the time of cura - tion , these were not displayed on public CTD . Significant expansion of our database architecture , incorporation of new tables and modification of existing ones , as well as in - troduction of new validation processes , now enable pub - lic access to the full exposure - related dataset . The addi - tional fields include details such as stressor source , recep - tor age , sex , race and smoking status , assay methods , lim - its of detection , and phenotype anatomy . New search fea - tures have also been incorporated into query pages to search 21 of the different ‘Exposure Details’ data fields . Currently , web pages automatically load with a default setting of 14 data columns ( e . g . Mercury : http : / / ctdbase . org / detail . go ? type = chem & acc = D008628 & view = expConsol ) , but users can now specify which report fields are shown and accord - ingly adjust the display to include any set of the 33 avail - able data categories . This allows investigators to more read - ily compare exposure measurements for specific parame - ters , such as enrollment years , race / ethnicity , detection fre - quency , U . S . state , etc . This expanded content of ‘Exposure - event associations’ is also freely available to download ( http : / / ctdbase . org / downloads / # exposureevents ) . Additional disease mappings in MEDIC Since 2006 , CTD has maintained and used MEDIC as a practical vocabulary for curating disease information ( 15 ) . We created MEDIC by merging disease terms from the flat list of the OMIM resource ( 39 ) into the MeSH dis - ease hierarchy ( 35 ) to produce an extensive , navigable con - trolled vocabulary . In the initial construction of MEDIC , we only mapped OMIM disease terms that had a known gene association . To help synchronize MEDIC with a more current version of OMIM , we routinely re - examine the OMIM source files to determine if additional diseases with associated genes had been added . In December 2017 , CTD manually reviewed and mapped 1717 new OMIM terms into MEDIC following established protocols ( 15 ) . MEDIC is still proving to be remarkably successful , con - venient , robust , and adaptable , and we continue to create cross - references between MEDIC terms ( MESH : ID and OMIM : ID ) and the Disease Ontology ( 40 ) to help build a more comprehensive , interoperable ( e . g . Figure 2C ) , and complete disease vocabulary for the scientific community . The improved MEDIC is freely available as a data file from CTD ( http : / / ctdbase . org / downloads / # alldiseases ) . Computational resources The increased data content , coupled with the new and complex interrelationships between the core CTD datasets and the new phenotype - and exposure - related functional - ity , taxed CTD’s existing computational infrastructure . In order accommodate the increased processing load , and to provide enhanced computational capacity moving forward , significant upgrades were made to the infrastructure . Older servers were replaced with current generation server blades that integrate more and faster CPUs with larger memory capacity . Additional storage capacity for the database was also procured in the form of new , faster storage arrays , and the server operating systems , PostgreSQL database servers , Tomcat application servers , and all 3rd party libraries were tested and upgraded to current versions . FUTURE DIRECTIONS CTD’s first and foremost priority is always to increase data content , improve data completeness , and maintain data cur - rency to keep CTD relevant , comprehensive , and up - to - date in an efficient manner . Additionally , we will explore ways to make phenotype content even more functional and visible . One aim is to in - corporate and display ‘Inferred Phenotypes’ as a new data - tab on CTD disease pages . This will tabulate phenotypes that can be inferred to diseases based upon shared chemi - cals ( e . g . Figure 2D ) or shared genes , and will allow users Nucleic Acids Research , 2019 , Vol . 47 , Database issue D953 to visualize genes , chemicals , phenotypes , and diseases in a single row , accommodating the construction of poten - tial AOPs . As well , we plan to add phenotype content as input and output options to our suite of analytical and visualization tools , such as Batch Query and VennViewer ( http : / / ctdbase . org / tools / ) . Finally , we continually investigate ways in which to curate and produce additional content and facilitate exploration of our dataset . To wit , while manually curating the scien - tific literature , CTD biocurators often encounter unique author - created synonyms , abbreviations , or acronyms for chemicals , and many of these new phrases are not part of the current synonym list in CTD . Collecting and adding these new chemical terms to our chemical controlled vo - cabulary will not only help biocurators and users identify their chemical - of - interest in the database , but also enable us to construct a more comprehensive , relevant dictionary of chemical phrases for the scientific community and CTD text - mining projects ( 41 ) . Toward that end , we plan to de - velop and implement a new ‘chemical synonym collection’ feature to the CTD Curation Tool ( 6 ) , allowing biocurators to easily and rapidly collect newly encountered literature - based synonyms , abbreviations , acronyms , and CAS num - bers , together with the associated PubMed article ( for trace - ability ) . Ultimately , these new terms will be displayed on CTD official chemical pages and be searchable in all query forms . Other potential enhancements include further con - textualizing CTD curated interactions with ‘in vitro / in vivo ’ status and adding taxon information to our collected dis - ease annotations ( to highlight animal models of disease ) . We have been collecting these data for a number of years , but have not yet made them public , and we are exploring the best ways to integrate this value - added content throughout the CTD framework . SUMMARY 1 . CTD curated content has increased by 46 % and now pro - vides more than 38 million toxicogenomic relationships . 2 . CTD has launched a new chemical – phenotype module , with over 169 000 manually curated interactions relating 6700 chemicals , 4200 non - disease phenotypes , and 790 anatomical terms for 230 taxa ; these data can be used both for knowledge discovery and generating predictive AOPs , and is searchable with an advanced query form . 3 . CTD exposure content has increased by 74 % , with ad - ditional functionality from two new querying parameters ( Study Factors and Associated Study Titles ) for ‘Exposure Studies’ and expanded content , query capability , and cus - tomizable web display options for ‘Exposure Details’ . 4 . CTD’s MEDIC disease controlled vocabulary has been updated with > 1700 additional diseases and accession identifiers from OMIM . 5 . CTD has upgraded its computational infrastructure to accommodate data content and functionality .
