VacA binds to two types of receptor - like protein tyrosine phosphatase ( RPTP ) , RPTP α and RPTP β , on the surface of host cells . VacA bound to RPTP β , relocates and concentrates in lipid rafts in the plasma membrane . VacA causes vacuolization , membrane anion - selective channel and pore formation , and disruption of endosomal and lysosomal activity in host cells . Secreted VacA is processed into p33 and p55 fragments . The p55 domain not only plays a role in binding to target cells but also in the formation of oligomeric structures and anionic membrane channels . Oral administration of VacA to wild - type mice , but not to RPTP β knockout mice , resulted in gastric ulcers , in agreement with the clinical effect of VacA . VacA with s1 / m1 allele has more potent cytotoxic activity in relation to peptic ulcer disease and appears to be associated with human gastric cancer . VacA activates pro - apoptotic Bcl - 2 family proteins , and induces apoptosis via a mitochondria - dependent pathway . VacA can disrupt other signal transduction pathways ; VacA activates p38 MAPK , enhancing production of IL - 8 and PGE 2 , and PI3K / Akt , suppressing GSK - 3 β activity . VacA has immunomodulatory actions on T cells and other immune cells , possibly contributing to the chronic infection seen with this organism . H . pylori virulence factors including VacA and CagA , which is encoded by cytotoxin - associated gene A , along with host genetic and environmental factors , constitute a complex network to regulate chronic gastric injury and inﬂammation , which is involved in a multistep process leading to gastric carcinogenesis . Keywords : Helicobacter pylori / vacuolating toxin / VacA Tohoku J . Exp . Med . , 2010 , 220 ( 1 ) , 3 - 14 . © 2010 Tohoku University Medical Press Persistent Helicobacter pylori ( H . pylori ) infection of the gastric epithelium is world wide and one of the most common infections . H . pylori is accepted as a major cause of gastroduodenal diseases including peptic ulcer disease , gastric lymphoma , and gastric adenocarcinoma . H . pylori virulence , host genetic and environmental factors constitute a complex network , leading to persistent immune and inflammatory responses , which are instrumental in a multi - step process resulting in gastric cancer ( Blaser and Atherton 2004 ) . The role of H . pylori in gastroduodenal diseases is firmly established . Pathology results from the intricate , ongoing interplay between environmental , bacterial , and host factors ( Blaser and Atherton 2004 ) . Strain - to - strain genetic variability in bacterial virulence factors not only affects the ability of the organism to colonize and cause dis - ease but also affects inflammation and gastric acid output . During the interactions with the host , H . pylori is able to adapt by mutations and DNA rearrangements , generating novel genotypes . On the host side , variations in the immune response to the chronic presence of H . pylori directly impact H . pylori - associated gastroduodenal diseases and affect gas - tric acid output and thereby , the density and location of the bacteria ( Blaser and Atherton 2004 ; Kusters et al . 2006 ) . Many of these H . pylori - host interactions have similarities with the interactions between the gut flora and the gastroin - testinal tract and may serve as a paradigm for the interac - tions between bacteria and their hosts . A number of bacteri - al virulence factors have been identified , including flagellin , urease , catalase , neutrophil - activating protein , adhesion , heat shock proteins , outer membrane proteins , γ - glutamyl - transpeptidase , lipopolysaccharide , cytotoxin - associated gene pathogenecity island ( cag PAI ) and vacuolating cyto - toxin ( VacA ) ( Fig . 1 , Blaser and Atherton 2004 ; Kusters et H . Isomoto et al . 4 al . 2006 ) . Host enzymes including nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) and cyclooxygenase may perturb the balance between gastric epithelial cell apoptosis and proliferation , resulting in ulcer formation and gastric cancer . The com - plete genome sequence of many H . pylori strains , isolated from patients with different clinical outcomes has provided useful information to identify new virulence genes by genomic , proteomic , and mutagenetic approaches . Host and bacterial factors may allow H . pylori to persist for decades and invoke an intense inflammatory response , leading even - tually to damage of host cells . About three decades of intense research into H . pylori virulence factors , in particular CagA and VacA , have revealed many aspects of the relationships between this bacterium , the gastric mucosal surface , and the pathogenesis of disease ( Miehike et al . 2001 ; Cover and Blanke 2005 ; Kusters et al . 2006 ; Hatakeyama 2008 ; Sewald et al . 2008a , Wen and Moss 2009 ) . CagA , encoded by the cagA gene , is a marker for the presence of the 40 - kb - long genomic Pathogenicity Island , PAI ( Covacci et al . 1993 ) and contrib - utes to the inflammatory response by initiating a signal transduction cascade , resulting in interleukin - 8 production . VacA not only causes vacuolization , which is the most prominent feature and the basis for its name ( Fig . 2 ) , but also exerts pleiotropic actions on gastric epithelial cells and other cell types ( Kusters et al . 2006 ) . VacA is an important virulence factor in the pathogenesis of peptic ulceration and gastric cancer . VacA can induce multiple cellular activities , including cell vacuolation , membrane channel formation , disruption of endosomal⁄lysosomal function , apoptosis , and immunomodulation . VacA protein influences cellular pro - cesses via different routes , thus assisting in chronic coloni - zation of the gastric mucosa by H . pylori ( Fig . 3 ) . ( 1 ) VacA secreted by type V - secretion system of H . pylori may either ( 2 ) bind to a cell membrane receptor and initiate a proin - flammatory response , ( 3 ) be taken up directly by the cell , traffic to the mitochondria , and induce apoptosis , ( 4 ) be tak - en up by endocytosis and induce vacuolization , ( 5 ) form a membrane channel , resulting in leakage of nutrients to the extracellular space , or ( 6 ) pass through the tight junctions and inhibit T - cell activation and proliferation . Although VacA is not essential for in vitro growth of H . pylori , it was reported to significantly contribute to murine gastric coloni - zation by H . pylori ( Salama et al . 2001 ) . Fig . 1 . Helicobacter pylori products appear to be involved in virulence . There are bacterial virulence factors such as adhes - ins ( AlpA / B , BabA , HopQ and SabA ) , urease , catalase , neutrophil - activating protein ( NAP ) , adhesin , heat shock pro - teins ( HSP60 ) , outer membrane proteins ( OipA ) , glutamyltranspeptidase ( γ - GTP ) , lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , cytotoxin - associated gene pathogenecity island ( cag PAI ) and vacuolating cytotoxin ( VacA ) . The cag PAI - encoded proteins serve as building blocks of a type IV secretion apparatus , which forms a syringe - like structure capable of penetrating gastric epithelial cells and facilitating the translocation of CagA . CagA is encoded by cagA gene is a marker for the presence of the 40 kb - long genomic cag PAI and contributes to the inflammatory response by initiating a signal transduction cascade , resulting in interleukin ( IL ) 8 production . LPS can also induce enhanced production of various proinflammatory cyto - kines . NAP plays a role as a chemoattractant for neutrophils . VacA causes cellular disorder and inhibition of T - cell acti - vation along with γ - GTP . Urease exerts strong activity to generate ammonia from urea , then producing monochloramine , a harmful bioactive molecule against the epithelium . Additional enzyme products including mucinase , phospholipase , lipase and protease damage mucus layer covering the gastric epithelium . Pleiotropic Actions of Helicobacter pylori Vacuolating Toxin , VacA 5 Structure and function of VacA Unlike the cag PAI , the vacA gene is present in all strains . The vacA gene encodes 140 - kDa protoxin ( Papini et al . 2001 ; Cover and Blanke 2005 ; Sewald et al . 2008a ) . Proteolytic processing during secretion via the type V - secretion system produces a mature 90 kDa toxin that forms flower - shaped dodecameric aggregates , which are disassembled by acid - activation to increase toxicity ( Cover et al . 1997 ) . Secreted VacA can be further processed into an N - terminal fragment of 33 kDa ( p33 ) and a C - terminal frag - ment of 55 kDa ( p55 ) , but cleavage does not seem to be necessary for VacA activity ( Papini et al . 2001 ; Cover and Blanke 2005 ; Sewald et al . 2008a ) . The p33 domain exhib - its pore - forming activity necessary for vacuole formation ( McClain et al . 2003 ) , whereas the p55 domain is responsi - ble for target cell binding ( Reyrat et al . 1999 ) . Recently , Ivie et al . ( 2008 ) showed that the N - terminal of p55 is important for the formation of VacA oligomeric structures and is essential for VacA - induced vacuolation , for host cell membrane depolarization , and for formation of anionic membrane channels . In addition , Gangwer et al . ( 2007 ) Fig . 2 . VacA induces massive vacuolization in gastric epithelial cells ( AZ - 521 , a human gastric cancer cell line ) . Fig . 3 . VacA has pleiotropic effects on human cells including vacuolization , membrane channel formation , disruption of endosomal ⁄ lysosomal function , apoptosis , and immunomodulation . Secreted VacA may bind to a cell membrane recep - tor and initiate a proinflammatory response , traffic to the mitochondria and induce apoptosis , be taken up by endocytosis and induce vacuolization , form a membrane channel , disturb epithelial barrier , or pass through tight junctions and inhibit T - cell activation and proliferation . H . Isomoto et al . 6 solved the crystal structure of p55 , which consists of a par - allel β - helix with a carboxy - terminal globular domain , indi - cating how p55 monomers may assemble into oligomers capable of membrane pore formation . VacA forms anion - selective channels in endosomal membranes through its interaction with lipids ( Tombola et al . 1999 ; Czajkowsky et al . 1999 ) . The assembly of six molecules of VacA forms an anion - selective channel in lipid bilayers , and its channel activity is inhibited by chloride channel blockers . A nonspecific chloride channel blocker , NPPB , can inhibit the channel activity of VacA , resulting in a reduction of vacuolation . H . pylori strains vary considerably in production of cytotoxin activity and this is primarily due to variations in vacA gene structure . The variable regions are located near the 5´ - end , s1 or s2 , and in the mid - region , m1 or m2 . All possible combinations of these regions ( s1 / m1 , s1 / m2 , s2 / m1 and s2 / m2 ) have been reported in clinical isolates of H . pylori , although s2 / m1 alleles are rare ( Atherton et al . 1995 ; van Doorn et al . 1999 ; Cover and Blanke 2005 ) . In studies of the clinical relevance of vacA genotypes , the s1 type vacA alleles were found to be associated with the pres - ence of peptic ulcers ( Atherton et al . 1995 ) . It has also been reported that s1 type vacA gene products are secreted at higher levels than s2 type vacA products ( Sewald et al . 2008a ) . Other studies , which examined the relationship between the quantity of VacA and gastric ulcers using a very sensitive method , bead - ELISA , revealed that the amount of VacA secreted by H . pylori correlates with the presence of gastric ulcers ( Shirasaka et al . 2002 ) . Again , H . pylori strains that possess a type s1 / m1 vacA allele are associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer and enhanced gas - tric epithelial cell injury ( Atherton et al . 1997 ; Peek and Crabtree 2006 ) compared with vacA s2 / m2 strains . The relationship between s1 / m1 alleles and gastric cancer is consistent with the distribution of vacA genotypes through - out the world . In regions where the background prevalence rate of distal gastric cancer is high , such as Colombia and Japan , most H . pylori strains contain type s1 / m1 alleles ( van Doorn et al . 1999 ) , whereas the converse is true in regions of the world with low rates of non - cardia gastric adenocar - cinoma ( Peek and Crabtree 2006 ) . VacA exerts effects on epithelial cells that may lower the threshold for carcinogen - esis . The vacA intermediate ( i ) - region , which encodes part of the p33 domain of VacA , displays sequence variation at the nucleotide level ( Rhead et al . 2007 ) . i1 - type strains , but not i2 - type strain , were associated with gastric carcinoma in an Iranian population ( Rhead et al . 2007 ; Hussein et al . 2008 ) , and were an independent predictor of peptic ulcer disease in an Italian population ( Basso et al . 2008 ) . In an in vitro study of vacuolating activity on HeLa cells , the culture supernatants of the strains encoding the s1 / m1 vacA gene had the greatest vacuolating activity , the strains encoding the s1 / m2 vacA gene had intermediate vac - uolating activity , and the strains encoding the s2 / m2 vacA gene had no detectable cytotoxic activity ( Atherton et al . 1995 ) . One possible cause of these differences in cytotoxic - ity is the different cell type specificities of the mature tox - ins . The m1VacA and m2VacA , which are mainly produced by strains containing the s1 / m1 vacA and s1 / m2 vacA genes , respectively , have different cell type specificities in cytotoxicity assays . Whereas m1VacA is cytotoxic to HeLa cells , m2VacA is able to induce vacuolization in primary cultured human gastric cells and in non - gastric cell lines such as RK - 13 , but has no cytotoxic activity on HeLa cells ( Pagliaccia et al . 1998 ) . These preferences in cell types are caused by different binding abilities of the two types of VacA to the cells . These differences suggest that some receptor - mediated interactions exist with VacA that are im - portant in determining cytotoxicity . VacA receptor binding As is known for many toxins , binding of VacA to a receptor on the target cell surface is a crucial step for toxici - ty . Different potential VacA receptors have been described for different types of cells ( Sewald et al . 2008a ) . Among these , receptor - like protein tyrosine phosphatases RPTP α and RPTP β have been described as receptors for epithelial cells ( Yahiro et al . 1999 , 2003 ) . On the other hand , lym - phocyte function - associated antigen - 1 ( LFA - 1 ) was identi - fied as a specific VacA receptor on T - cells ( Sewald et al . 2008b ) but not epithelial cells . Thus , VacA uses different receptors for intoxication or modulation of epithelial or im - mune cells . A higher molecular mass VacA receptor , a 250 - kDa protein ( p250 ) , was detected only in the case of AZ - 521 cells , gastric epithelial – derived cells . Following isolation and sequencing , the p250 protein was identified as RPTPß ( Yahiro et al . 1999 ) . Chemical agents that promote the dif - ferentiation of HL - 60 cells into macrophage - and monocyte - like cells , but not granulocyte - like cells , enhance VacA sen - sitivity by increasing the expression of RPTPß ( Padilla et al . 2000 ) . G401 cells , a human kidney tumor cell line , lack RPTPß but respond to VacA , and p140 has been identified as another receptor protein for VacA . p140 was shown to be RPTP α ( Yahiro et al . 2003 ) , which was responsible for VacA - induced vacuolation in AGS cells ( Tegtmeyer et al . 2009 ) . Glycosylation at specific residues was essential for VacA binding to RPTP β ( Yahiro et al . 2004 ) , supporting the idea that an interaction of VacA with defined sugar residues is necessary for its function ( Roche et al . 2007 ) . Cell type - specific binding has been attributed to differences in the m1 and m2 alleles , with m1 VacA binding and inducing vacu - oles in HeLa cells , whereas m2 VacA vacuolates rabbit kid - ney ( RK13 ) and primary epithelial cells , but not HeLa cells ( Pagliaccia et al . 1998 ; Ji et al . 2000 ) . This cell type - spe - cific binding region of m1 VacA was mapped to amino acids 460 – 496 . m2 VacA has an insertion of 23 residues at amino acid 475 , consisting of an imperfect repeat of the upstream sequence . It is unclear whether this region is directly involved in receptor binding because RPTP α and RPTP β are both recognized by m2 VacA ( de Guzman et al . 2005 ) . Pleiotropic Actions of Helicobacter pylori Vacuolating Toxin , VacA 7 Recently , Gangwer et al . ( 2007 ) identified two conserved regions located at the N - terminal part of p55 as well as at the C - terminal region . The C - terminal region includes a disulfide bridge pocket formed by two conserved cysteine residues . This pocket is located at the outward surface of VacA oligomer and serves as a receptor - binding site . Following binding of monomeric VacA to a specific receptor , oligomerization leads to clustering of VacA in detergent - resistant membrane domains and subsequent endocytosis . We have demonstrated that binding of VacA to RPTP β in non - raft domains of the plasma membrane leads to relocation and concentration of the toxin – receptor com - plex into lipid rafts ( Fig . 4 ) ( Nakayama et al . 2006 ) . The oligomerization of VacA is essential for endocytosis ( Reyrat et al . 1999 ) . Internalization of VacA then takes place at lip - id raft structures and is described as a clathrin - independent pathway of endocytosis that requires cellular components such as the small GTPase Cdc42 and the actin cytoskeleton ( Ricci et al . 2000 ) . Treatment of VacA - sensitive cells with PI - PLC ( phosphatidylinositol - specific phospholipase C ) , which specifically removes proteins anchored to the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) anchor , reduces and delays VacA - induced cell vacuolization ( Ricci et al . 2000 ) , suggesting involvement of GPI - anchored pro - teins in VacA - induced vacuolization . RPTP β , a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan with an extracellular region containing a carbonic anhydrase - like domain and a single FNIII domain , has been shown to play an important role in cell migration , differentiation , synapto - genesis , synaptic function , and myelination in the central nervous system ( Deuel et al . 2002 ) . RPTPß was originally found to be highly expressed in brain . Virtually all glands in the gastric corpus of wild - type mouse contain detectable RPTP β , and expression is localized to the glandular basal region ( Fujikawa et al . 2003 ) . In mice , orally administered VacA causes degeneration of the gastric mucosa and acute inflammation , followed by gastric ulcer disease ( Telfold et al . 1994 ) . Using this mouse model system , RPTP β KO mice were subjected to VacA administration . Indeed , oral administration of VacA to wild - type mice , but not to RPTP β KO mice , resulted in gastric ulcers , suggesting that RPTP β is essential for the intoxication of gastric tissue by VacA ( Fujikawa et al . 2003 ) . Cellular vacuolization by VacA Cellular vacuolization is a unique function of VacA ( Fig . 2 ) . The membranes of these vacuoles contain the small GTP - binding protein Rab7 , late endosome and lyso - somal markers , and the membrane protein Lgp110 ( Molinari et al . 1997 ) . Accordingly , VacA might disrupt normal mem - brane trafficking at or near the level of late endosomes ( Montecucco and de Bernard 2003 ) . Vacuolation depends not only on VacA , but also on the presence of permeant weak bases in the extracellular medium ( Cover and Blaser 1992 ) . Microinjection of VacA or the transfection of plas - mids containing the vacA gene into HeLa cells resulted in the formation of intracellular vacuoles ( de Bernard et al . 1997 ) , providing evidence that VacA introduced into the cytosol acts on an intracellular target ; potential targets include the vacuolar ATPase ( V - ATPase ) , Rab7 , and Rac1 ( Papini et al . 1997 ; Hotchin et al . 2000 ) . It has been well established that VacA - induced vacuolation requires V - ATPase activity , and that its inhibitor , bafilomycin A1 , reduced VacA - induced vacuolation in mammalian cells ( Suzuki et al . 2001 ; Genisset et al . 2007 ) . Rab7 may be important for supporting membrane deposition and homo - typic fusion between late endosomes . Dynamin , a high molecular weight GTP - binding protein that functions as a mechanochemical enzyme in vesicle formation , is involved in VacA - induced vacuolation ( Cover et al . 1993 ) . In addi - tion , transient transfection of the dominant - negative mutant syntaxin 7 was also found to inhibit VacA - induced vacuola - tion ( Suzuki et al . 2003 ) . Syntaxin 7 is an integral mem - brane protein present on both late endosomes and lysosomes and functions in their heterotypic fusion as part of the SNARE ( soluble N - ethylmaleimide - sensitive - factor attach - Fig . 4 . Translocation of VacA bound to receptor - like protein tyrosine phosphatase ( RPTP ) β to lipid rafts . The binding of VacA to RPTP β in non - raft domains of the plasma membrane leads to relocation and concentration of the toxin – receptor complex in lipid rafts . Lipid rafts were isolated by ultracentrifugation in a sucrose density gradi - ent and were enriched in cholesterol ( Fraction 3 ) . VacA incubated with cells appeared in the lipid raft fraction in a dose - dependent fashion . In parallel with VacA translo - cation to lipid rafts , RPTP β also accumulated in lipid rafts from non - lipid raft microdomain ( Nakayama et al . 2006 ) . H . Isomoto et al . 8 ment protein receptor ) complex in association with other SNARE proteins ( Südhof and Rothman 2009 ) . In addition , expression of syntaxin 7 mRNA and protein in AGS cells is enhanced by exposure to VacA , indicating the involvement of syntaxin 7 in VacA - induced vacuolation ( Suzuki et al . 2003 ) . At the final steps of vacuole formation by VacA , vesicle associated membrane protein 7 ( VAMP7 ) is a part - ner of syntaxin 7 in the process of lysosome – endosome fusion ( Mashima et al . 2008 ) . These results suggest that VacA - induced vacuolization is a result of a toxin - induced alteration of intracellular vesicle trafficking . Interestingly , it was demonstrated that CD2 - associated protein ( CD2AP ) , an adaptor protein implicated in intracellular trafficking , which regulates filamentous actin ( F - actin ) structures , was required to transfer VacA from early to late endosomes ( Gauthier et al . 2007 ) after VacA was internalized by a pinocytic mechanism that involves F - actin and Cdc42 but was independent of clathrin , dynamin , and ARF6 GTPase ( Gauthier et al . 2005 ) . They also suggested that sorting of VacA in these compartments requires dynamic F - actin struc - tures on early endosomes , which is characterized as being enriched with GPI - anchored proteins ( Ricci et al . 2000 ; Gauthier et al . 2005 ) . VacA - induced apoptotic cell death Several lines of evidence have documented that VacA induces apoptotic cell death via a mitochondria - dependent pathway in gastric epithelial cells ( Kimura et al . 1999 ; Galmiche et al . 2000 ; Yamasaki et al . 2006 ) . It is known that VacA reduces the membrane potential of mitochondria , resulting in cytochrome c release . Both full - length VacA and its p37 domain genes transfected into Hep - 2 cells local - ize to the mitochondrial matrix , whereas the p58 domain remains in the cytosol ( Galmiche et al . 2000 ) . VacA accu - mulated into the mitochondria inner membrane , resulting in apoptotic cell death ( Galmiche et al . 2000 ) . On the other hand , in our experiments using immunostaining and confo - cal microscopy , most VacA was localized to vacuoles , marked by Rab7 - GFP , rather than mitochondria ( Yamasaki et al . 2006 ) . These results suggest that VacA may not directly induce cytochrome c release from mitochnodria , and instead , suggest that apoptosis - related factors such as proapoptotic Bcl - 2 family proteins may be involved ( Fig . 5 ) . Bax and Bak are pivotal regulators of cytochrome c release ( Mérino and Bouillet 2009 ) . We performed immunostain - ing and confocal microscopy with comformation - specific antibodies against Bax and Bak , which identify their active forms . After stimulation with VacA , active forms of pro - apoptotic Bax as well as Bak appeared ( Yamasaki et al . 2006 ) and accumulated on mitochondria . The time course of Bax activation in response to VacA paralleled that of cytochrome c release . In line with this , activation of cas - pase 3 and cleavage of PARP ( poly ( ADP - ribose ) polymerase ) were confirmed . Thus , our data have shown that in response to VacA , Bax and Bak activation cause cyto - chrome c release from mitochondria and apoptotic cellular death . Again , the pro - apoptotic Bcl - 2 protein - mediated apoptosis execution was vacuolation - independent ( Yamasaki et al . 2006 ) . More recently , we documented the relationship among Fig . 5 . Regulation of mitochondria - associated apoptosis by Bcl - 2 family members . The Bcl - 2 proteins are classified into subgroups , according to their function ( anti - or pro - apoptotic ) . Pro - apoptotic Bcl - 2 members , Bax and Bak are pivotal regulators of cytochrome c release , leading to activation of caspase 3 , cleavage of PARP ( poly ( ADP - ribose ) polymerase ) and apoptosis execution . The major members of anti - apoptotic Bcl - 2 proteins are Bcl - 2 , Bcl - X L and myeloid cell leuke - mia 1 ( Mcl - 1 ) . Pleiotropic Actions of Helicobacter pylori Vacuolating Toxin , VacA 9 VacA , apoptosis and anti - apoptotic Bcl - 2 proteins ( in sub - mission ) . The major members of anti - apoptotic Bcl - 2 pro - teins are Bcl - 2 , Bcl - X L and myeloid cell leukemia 1 ( Mcl - 1 ) ( Mérino and Bouillet 2009 ) . JAK ( Janus kinase ) - STAT3 ( Signal Transduction and Activator of Transcription ) signal - ing pathway regulates each family member of the Bcl - 2 sub - family proteins . STAT3 is phosphorylated by JAKs , then dimerizes and translocates to the nucleus . Active STAT3 dimers bind to the responsible element of each gene promoter , and up - regulate target gene expression ( Fig . 6 ) ( Isomoto 2009 ) . By immunoblot analysis , cellular STAT3 expression of the AZ521 cells was substantially reduced by VacA in a dose - dependent manner . In parallel with this , Bcl - 2 and Bcl - xL expression was substantially reduced . Down - regulation of STAT3 and Bcl - 2 family proteins was independent of VacA - induced vacuolation . Instead , treat - ment with a JNK inhibitor restored VacA - induced STAT3 inhibition to the basal level , suggesting that STAT3 inhibi - tion in response to VacA may be dependent on JNK activity . The proposed mechanisms of VacA - induced apoptosis in gastric epithelial cells are outlined in Fig . 6 . H . pylori induces apoptosis of infected macrophages ( Menaker et al . 2004 ) . RAW 264 . 7 cells infected with a vir - ulent H . pylori strain 60190 , which possesses the cag PAI and vacA , displayed morphological features characteristic of an apoptotic cell . Immunoblot analysis showed that bac - terial infection induced a time - dependent increase of pro - caspase 8 and disappearance of full - length Bid in macro - phages compared with the uninfected cells . Isogenic mutants of 60190 deficient in either cagA or vacA induced significantly less apoptosis than the parent strain . These results suggest that H . pylori can also induce apoptosis of macrophages in association with alterations in the mito - chondrial pathway . Elimination of this key immunomudu - latory cell may represent a mechanism employed by the bacterium to evade host immune responses . Other disruptions of cellular signal transduction by VacA Nakayama et al . ( 2004 ) showed VacA - induced activa - tion of the p38 MAPK ( mitogen - activated protein kinase ) / ATF - 2 ( activating transcription factor 2 ) - mediated signal transduction pathway , independent of cellular vacuolization , in gastric epithelium - derived cell line , AZ - 521 . Interestingly , in AZ - 521 cells , VacA enhanced PGE 2 produc - tion through induction of cyclooxygenase - 2 expression via the p38 MAPK / ATF - 2 cascade ( Hisatsune et al . 2007 ) . In contrast , Tuo et al . ( 2009 ) demonstrated that VacA inhibited PGE 2 - stimulated duodenal mucosal bicarbonate secretion by stimulating the release of mucosal histamine , suggesting that the inhibitory effect of VacA on bicarbonate secretion may impair duodenal mucosal defense against acid injury , eventually leading to ulcer development . On the other hand , VacA stimulated calpain - mediated proteolysis of ezrin in parietal cells , thereby leading to disruption of apical membrane - cytoskeletal interactions and inhibition of gastric acid secretion , modeling the hypochlorhydric state of patients infected with H . pylori ( Wang et al . 2008 ) . Fig . 6 . Hypothetical mechanisms of VacA - induced apoptosis . By binding to receptor , VacA induces STAT ( Signal Transduc - tion and Activator of Transcription ) 3 down - regulation , possibly via JNK activation . Reduction in STAT3 leads to pro - apoptotic Bcl - 2 family proteins , in particular Bcl - 2 and Bcl - X L . Bcl - 2 and Bcl - X L down - regulation resulted in the accel - eration of apoptosis . Alternatively , VacA intoxication induces Bax / Bak activation . These pro - apoptotic Bcl - 2 family proteins accumulate in mitochondria and cause cytochrome c release . H . Isomoto et al . 10 With regard to a potential role for VacA in inflamma - tion , VacA was shown to induce bone marrow - derived mast cells to produce proinflammatory cytokines , tumor necrosis factor α , macrophage inflammatory protein 1 α , interleukin ( IL ) - 1 β , IL - 6 , IL - 10 , and IL - 13 ( Supajatura et al . 2002 ) . Recently , Hisatune et al . ( 2008 ) have shown that VacA enhanced production and secretion of IL - 8 , an important mediator in the immunopathogenesis of chronic gastritis . Upon stimulation with VacA , increased IL - 8 release into the supernatant was observed in some cultured cell types , such as A549 cells , a lung cancer cell line , and monocyte - derived U937 cells . Among various cytokines , IL - 8 , followed by monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 were found most abun - dantly released from U937 cells when stimulated with active VacA , but not inactivated VacA ( Fig . 7 ) . In U937 cells , VacA directly increased IL - 8 production by activation of the p38 MAPK via intracellular Ca2 + release , leading to activation of the transcription factors , ATF - 2 and CREB ( cyclic AMP response element - binding protein ) . In addi - tion , the enhanced production of IL - 8 by VacA may be attributable in part to NF ( nuclear factor ) - κ B signaling . VacA can block activation of NFAT , a key transcrip - tion factor required for T cell activation ( Boncristiano et al . 2003 ; Gebert et al . 2003 ) . Moreover , Sundrud et al . ( 2004 ) reported that VacA inhibited the proliferation of primary human CD4 + T cells and demonstrated that this inhibitory effect on proliferation is not attributable to VacA effects on NFAT activation of IL - 2 expression . In addition , VacA sup - pressed IL - 2 - induced cell cycle progression without affect - ing IL - 2 - dependent survival ( Sundrud et al . 2004 ) . Furthermore , Torres et al . ( 2007 ) reported that VacA inhibit - ed the proliferation of CD8 + T cells and B cells . VacA inhibited both T - cell - induced and PMA / anti - IgM - induced proliferation of purified B cells . They proposed that the immunomodulatory actions of VacA on T and B lympho - cytes , the major effectors of the adaptive immune response , may contribute to the ability of H . pylori to establish a per - sistent infection in the human gastric mucosa . Interestingly , recent evidence indicated that VacA efficiently enters acti - vated , migrating primary human T lymphocytes by binding to the β 2 - integrin receptor subunit ( CD18 ) and exploiting the recycling of LFA - 1 ( Sewald et al . 2008b ) . LFA - 1 - deficient Jurkat T cells were resistant to vacuolation and IL - 2 modulation , and genetic complementation restored sensitivity to VacA . VacA targeted human , but not murine , CD18 for cell entry , consistent with the species - specific adaptation of H . pylori . Before interaction with CD18 , VacA needed to bind to a thus far unknown , probably GPI - anchored , membrane - associated protein ( factor X ) to be recruited together with factor X to the uropod of the trailing edge . It has become evident that glycogen synthase kinase - 3 β , GSK3 β , is a key enzyme in Wnt / β - catenin signaling and a crucial regulatory component of many cellular pathways , including apoptosis , cell cycle , cell polarity , migration , and gene expression . This multitasking by GSK3 β is achieved by its participation in signaling pathways involving the phosphoinositide 3 kinase ( PI3K ) / protein kinase B ( Akt ) cascade . Several studies showed that H . pylori activated the PI3K - Akt signaling pathway in epithelial cells ( Sokolova et al . 2008 ; Nakayama et al . 2009 ; Nagy et al . 2009 ; Tabassam et al . 2009 ) . Sokolova et al . ( 2008 ) demonstrated that H . pylori induced inhibition of β - catenin phosphorylation and ubiquitin - dependent degradation , leading to upregulation of Fig . 7 . VacA enhances production and secretion of IL - 8 . Stimulation of U937 cells , a human monocyte - derived cell line , with VacA ( 120 nM ) , increased IL - 8 release into cell supernatants . IL - 8 , followed by monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 ( MCP - 1 ) were the most abundantly released cytokines from U937 cells stimulated with active VacA , but not inactivat - ed VacA ( Hisatsune et al . 2008 ) . Pleiotropic Actions of Helicobacter pylori Vacuolating Toxin , VacA 11 T cell factor / lymphoid enhancer - binding factor ( Tcf / Lef ) - dependent transcription of cyclin D1 by suppression of GSK3 β activity . In addition , GSK3 β inhibition through PI3K - Akt activation by H . pylori resulted in NF - κ B activa - tion and IL - 8 production ( Tabassam et al . 2009 ) . It was also found that incubation of AZ - 521 cells with VacA resulted in phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3 β through a PI3K - dependent pathway ( Nakayama et al . 2009 ) . Following p h o s p h o r y l a t i o n a n d i n h i b i t i o n o f G S K 3 β , β - catenin was released from a GSK3 β / β - catenin complex , with subsequent nuclear translocation . This VacA - mediated activation of the PI3K / Akt signaling pathway did not require VacA internalization and was independent of vacuo - lation . In addition , VacA transactivated the β - catenin - dependent cyclin D1 promoter . These data support the hypothesis that Wnt - dependent signaling might play a role in the pathogenesis of VacA - dependent gastric damage , in - cluding the development of gastric cancer . Cellular pathway affected by VacA in the presence of CagA Recent study has shown that CagA activated a tran - scription factor , NFAT ( nuclear factor of activated T - cells ) in T lymphocytes , while VacA inhibited NFAT ( Yokoyama et al . 2005 ) : CagA and VacA are likely to exert opposite cel - lular effects in some aspects , and hence are related to a vari - ety of H . pylori – dependent diseases . VacA inhibited activa - tion of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) and HER2⁄Neu , and subsequently Erk1⁄2 , which are important for cell scattering and elongation ( Tegtmeyer et al . 2009 ) . Using human gastric epithelial cells in culture , transfected with cDNA encoding for either the wild - type 38 kDa C - terminal signaling domain of CagA or its non - tyrosine - phosphorylatable mutant form , Oldani et al . ( 2009 ) found that , depending on tyrosine - phosphorylation by host kinas - es , CagA inhibited VacA - induced apoptosis by two comple - mentary mechanisms . Tyrosine - phosphorylated CagA pre - vented pinocytosed VacA from reaching its intracellular compartments . Unphosphorylated CagA triggered an anti - apoptotic activity blocking VacA - induced apoptosis at the mitochondrial level without affecting the intracellular traf - ficking of VacA . Assays of the level of apoptosis of gastric epithelial cells infected with wild - type CagA + / VacA + H . pylori or isogenic mutants lacking of either CagA or VacA , showed that CagA antagonized VacA - induced apoptosis . These results , showing that VacA can inhibit some CagA - induced responses on epithelial cells , are consistent with previous findings suggesting that VacA and CagA have opposing effects ( Argent et al . 2008 ) . Vaccine Despite efforts over 25 years , an effective vaccine against H . pylori has not been developed . The intramuscu - lar vaccine formulation consisting of VacA , CagA and HP - NAP plus aluminium hydroxide adjuvant represents a very promising candidate for the prevention of H . pylori infection ( Malfertheiner et al . 2008 ) . A successful vaccine against H . pylori will be useful for preventing infection in 50 % of the world’s population and have a significant impact on global health . Conclusions H . pylori produces a potent exotoxin , VacA , which causes progressive vacuolization and gastric injury . VacA induces multiple effects on gastric epithelial and other cells : vacuolization with alterations of endo - lysosomal function , anion - selective channel formation , mitochondrial - dependent apoptosis , disruption of signal transduction pathways and inhibition of T - cell proliferation and activation . VacA binds to RPTPs , which is an essential step for intoxication . VacA causes gastric mucosal injury , gastric ulcer , and gastric can - cer . As described above , however , many bacterial factors , besides VacA , including outer membrane proteins , NAP , and CagA in cag PAI contribute to the pathogenicity of H . pylori . The multitude of these proteins and allelic variation makes it extremely difficult to test the contribution of each individual factor . Much effort has been put into identifying the mechanisms associated with H . pylori - associated gastro - duodenal diseases including peptic ulcer and gastric adeno - carcinoma .
