AFM is widely applied to obtain information about both cellular structural and subcellular events . In particular , a variety of investigations into membrane proteins and microfilaments were performed with AFM . Here , we in - troduce applications of AFM to molecular imaging of membrane proteins , and various approaches for ob - servation and identification of intracellular microfila - ments at the molecular level . These approaches can contribute to many applications of AFM in cell imaging . Keywords : membrane proteins ; microfilaments ; mi - croscopy , atomic force Introduction Optical microscopy has contributed greatly to various studies of biological materials , including cells and tissues ( Yi et al . , 2004 ; Lim et al . , 2009 ) . However , the resolution of optical microscopy , due to the diffraction limit of the light source , is not sufficient to visualize subcellular structures . The invention of electron microscopy ( EM ) advanced our insights into subcellular structures because it provided sub - nanometer resolution ( Yingge et al . , 2003 ; Ishikawa et al . , 2005 ; Kadam et al . , 2007 ) . Although this microscopy is appropriate for visua - lization of subcellular structures , it requires complex sample preparation and must be operated in a vacuum environment . Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) has emerged as a key approach for molecular imaging of biological samples because it can provide high - resolution images that are comparable with those of electron microscopy with minimal sample damage during its preparation ( Heuser and Kirschner , 1980 ; Svitkina et al . , 1995 ; Small et al . , 1999 ; Shahin and Barrera , 2008 ) . AFM was found to have several advantages over other microscopic technologies ( Table 1 ) . AFM provides the real height profile of samples with sub - nanometer resolution . The resolution of AFM topographs surpasses optical microscopic images and is comparable to EM images ( Ubbink and Scha ̈ r - Zammaretti , 2005 ; Matsko , 2007 ) . In addition , the process of sample preparation is far simpler than that of other microscopies . EM , a representative high - resolution imaging technique , requires processing of samples , such as cutting , detergent extraction , coating , and staining ( Heuser and Kirschner , 1980 ; Svitkina et al . , 1995 ; Small et al . , 1999 ) , and these treatments may cause damage to samples or result in artifacts ( Franz , and Mu ̈ ller , 2005 ) . On the other hand , because AFM does not require any additional treatment , biological samples can be imaged under nearly native conditions with minimal alteration or damage ( Bonfiglio et al . , 1995 ; Shahin and Barrera , 2008 ) . Thus , AFM allows real - time observation of morphological changes caused by various stimuli with high resolution in a physiolo - gical environment . These advantages have attracted interests in AFM for cell imaging at remarkable resolution as an alternative imaging technique ( Shahin and Barrera , 2008 ) . In this review , we will introduce recent applications of AFM to imaging of cell membrane proteins and microfilaments , which are closely related with mechanical property and dynamics of cells . Principles of AFM AFM uses ultra sharp tips mounted at the end of a flexible cantilever ( tip radius 10 - 40 nm ) as probes instead of an incident beam , as with optical microscopes ( Zasadzinski et al . , 1990 ; Hansma et al . , 1994 ; Shahin and Barrera , 2008 ) .

Comparison between atomic force microscopy , optical microscopy , and electron microscopy in cell imaging . concept of AFM operation is reconstruction of three - dimensional maps by measuring the force between a sample and the sharp tip ( Kirat et al . , 2005 ) . The cantilever is mounted on a piezoelectric scanner , which allows movement in either the horizontal ( x , y ) or vertical ( z ) dimension ( Figure 1A ) . The tip is moved close to the sample surface and is raster scanned over the sample surface while moving vertically . AFM imaging can be classified into the following modes by the moving type of tips over the samples . In the DC mode ( contact mode ) , the most com - monly used AFM mode , an AFM tip attached to the end of a flexible cantilever is in perpetual contact with the sample . When the AFM tip approaches to the sample surface , deflection of cantilever is induced by various forces between the tip and the sample according to the Hooke ' s law ( Figure 1B ) . The AFM tip is raster scanned over the sample while the force applied to tip for keeping the constant deflection by feedback control . The DC mode AFM is very useful for imaging of samples with either hard surface or large variations in height . However , soft biological samples can be scraped or deformed by the frictional forces produced during scanning . Also , overloaded force applied on the cantilever may indent samples critically or wear out the sharp tip . In addition , AFM tip can be easily contaminated by adsorption of molecules detached from sample surface ( Shahin and Barrera , 2008 ) . The AC mode AFM including non - contact and tapping was developed to overcome the problems related with friction , adhesion , and electrostatic forces ( Zhong et al . , 1993 ; Hansma et al . , 1994 ) . In the AC mode , the tip oscillates vertically near its near resonance frequency with amplitudes ranging between 20 and 100 nm and is in contact with the surface at lower part of its oscillation ( Figure 1C ) ( Gadegaard , 2006 ; Shahin and Barrera , 2008 ) . When the vertically oscillating tip comes closer to the surface of sample , the oscillation amplitude is reduced by interaction between the tip and the sample . AFM tip is raster scanned with keeping the oscillation amplitude . In this mode , since the orbit of cantilever oscillation is slightly distant from sample surface , samples are clearly imaged without any damage of sample surfaces . Thus , the AC mode AFM allows high - resolution imaging of sample surfaces including soft materials , poorly bounded molecules to a substrate ( Dryden et al . , 1999 ; Ellis et al . , 1999 ; Hansma et al . , 2003 ; Geisse et al . , 2004 ) . The lateral force microscopy ( LFM ) is one of the imaging modes to indentify compositional diffe - rences of samples and to distinguish frictional characteristics of samples . In the LFM mode , operation mechanism is very similar to the DC mode AFM but the probe is scanned perpendicular to its length . During imaging in the LFM mode , cantilever will twist more or less depending on the frictional characteristics of the sample surface ( Figure 1D ) . LFM is useful for differentiating components of heterogeneous surfaces since it can provide simultaneously topographic and frictional information of the sample surface . Furthermore , an applied use of LFM is chemical force microscopy , where the tip is modified with specific chemicals and scanned over the sample to investigate the character of various surfaces ( e . g . functional group imaging ) ( Frisbie et al . , 1994 ; Fiorini et al . , 2001 ) . In force spectroscopy , the force between the AFM tip and samples is measured as a function of force vs . distance using Hooke’s law , as the AFM tip approaches and retracts from the surface ( Figure 1E ) . The attractive force between the tip and the sample surface may induce changes in the force - distance curve . The information of sample elasticity is obtained by analysis of these changes with appropriate theoretical models ( Dupres et al . , 2007 ) . This approach is very useful in the study of mechanical properties of living cells and dynamic cellular events , including cellular signaling path - ways and cell migration , because it can be performed under nearly physiological conditions AFM imaging of membrane proteins and microfilaments 599 Figure 1 .

( B - E ) Four widely used atomic force microscopy oper - ation modes : ( B ) DC mode , ( C ) AC mode , ( D ) lateral force microscopy , and ( E ) Force spectroscopy . A typi - cal force - distance curve is shown ( E ) . The cantilever is not deflected yet ( 1 ) . As the tip approaches to the surface , the cantilever bends up - ward by repulsive forces ( 2 ) . As the tip retracts from the surface , the cantilever bends downward by at - tractive forces between the tip and sample ( 3 ) . ( Grzywa et al . , 2006 ; Lamontagne et al . , 2008 ) . This approach can be applied to molecular recognition on the cell surface by modification of AFM tips with cell adhesion proteins , such as cadherins ( Baumgartner et al . , 2000 ) , integrins ( Zhang et al . , 2002 ; Li et al . , 2003 ) , selectins ( Zhang et al . , 2004 ) and bacterial adhesions ( Dupres et al . , 2005 , 2007 ) . Furthermore , force spectroscopy can be applied to force mapping by scanning the selected region , which can be compared to the topological imaging ( Dupres et al . , 2007 ; Heredia et al . , 2007 ; Jung et al . , 2009b ) . Applications of AFM to imaging of membrane proteins AFM has been widely applied to the imaging of small biological samples such as biomolecules ( e . g . , proteins and DNA ) ( Shin et al . , 2005 ; Lesoil et al . , 2010 ) and small organisms ( e . g . , viruses and bacteria ) ( Geisse et al . , 2004 ; Kim et al . , 2006 ) , which are not visible under optical microscopy . Efforts to observe the ultra - structures of cells using AFM have gradually increased since its invention ( Gould et al . , 1990 ; Muller and Engel , 1999 ; Kreplak et al . , 2007 ; Jaroslawski et al . , 2007 ; Yu et al . , 2007 ) . Early studies of cells with AFM were focused on topological observation by high - reso - 600 Exp . Mol . Med . Vol . 42 ( 9 ) , 597 - 605 , 2010 lution imaging . In this session , we introduce various applications of AFM to membrane biology . Imaging of membrane channels AFM imaging has been performed in fixed or living cells under air or physiological environments after Gould et al . ( 1990 ) first demonstrated AFM images of dried red blood cells and bacteria . AFM has been used for the study of membrane channels because it allows observation of cell surfaces in their native environment at remarkable resolution ( Jaroslawski et al . 2007 ; Yu et al . , 2007 ; Muller , 2008 ; Stewart et al . , 2010 ) . Jaroslawski et al . ( 2007 ) have directly visualized gating of KirBac3 . 1 potassium channels by AFM imaging . KirVac3 . 1 is one member of a family of transmembrane pota - ssium channels , and gating of Kir channels is spontaneous but modulated by intracellular mole - cules such as lipids ( PIP 2 ) , G - proteins , nucleotides , and ions ( H + , Ca 2 + , Mg 2 + ) . Yu et al . ( 2007 ) demonstrated that pH - induced conformational changes in connexin 26 hemichannels were modu - lated by aminosulfonate . They removed the upper layer of the gap junction channel by repetitive scanning AFM tip with loading of strong force . Stewart et al . ( 2010 ) revealed the tetrameric structure of the TRPM8 channel , which mediates the passage of cations across the plasma mem - brane , by AFM imaging . AFM imaging of two - dimensional crystals of Escherichia coli OmpF porins visualized voltage - and pH - induced gating of the porin , which facilitates the passage of small solutes ( Muller and Engel , 1999 ) . It was suggested that the bacteria protect themselves by these conformational changes of porins from drastic changes of the environment ( Muller and Engel , 1999 ) . Conformational changes of native mem - brane related to channel gating were shown by time - lapse AFM imaging ( Muller and Engel , 1999 ; Jaroslawski et al . , 2007 ; Yu et al . , 2007 ) . Force spectroscopy of membrane proteins Force spectroscopy with AFM , based on Hooke ' s law , has become a powerful tool for recognition of membrane proteins such as receptors . To probe membrane proteins in cells and to characterize the cell surface , the AFM tip needs to be modified with a specific chemical or ligand ( Dufrene , 2000 ; Zhang et al . , 2002 ; Li et al . , 2003 ) . Almqvist et al . ( 2004 ) studied the effect of membrane receptor clustering on local cell mechanics by mapping interaction forces between antibody - conjugated AFM tips and a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor . Jiang group ( 2009 ) reported distribution of Na + - K + ATPase , a key transmembrane protein , in human red blood cells using AFM tips modified with antibody against Na + - K + ATPase . This method was also applied to mapping of interactions between calcitonin and calcitonin receptor in osteocalst cells using AFM tips modified with calcitonin ( Lehenkari et al , 2000 ) . In addition , it was reported that the combined imaging of fluo - rescence , topography and recognition was applied to detect density , distribution , and localization of YFP - labeled CD1d molecules on α - galactosylcera - mide - loaded THP1 cells ( Duman et al , 2010 ) . However , these approaches are limited to mem - brane proteins existed on the membrane surface of cells . Thus , Carnally et al . ( 2010 ) demonstrated interaction between sigma - 1 receptors , which interact with a variety ion channel , and isolated acid - sensing ion channels using AFM . In addition , Kasai et al . ( 2010 ) applied AFM to observe tetrameric structure of ionotropic glutamate recep - tors after purification and reconstitution into lipid bilayers . Various approaches to AFM imaging of microfilaments One of the most active targets studied with AFM within cells is microfilaments . The microfilament plays an important role in many cellular processes such as physical and biochemical connection of the cell to external environment and spatial organization of cellular contents . It also generates coordinated forces that enable the cells to move and change their shape and generate ( Fletcher and Mullins , 2010 ) . In particular , the polymerization and depolymerization of microfilaments drive cytoplasmic organization , cell division , and cell motility ( Azoury et al . , 2009 ; Kueh and Mitchison , 2009 ) . In addition , the association of microfila - ments with the cell membrane plays a critical role in endocytosis and anchoring membrane proteins ( Papakonstanti and Stournaras , 2008 ; Robertson et al . , 2009 ) . Thus , AFM was applied to reveal the mechanism of actin polymerization in vitro at the molecular scale ( Ikawa et al , 2007 ) . However , it was a big challenge to image intracellular micro - filaments using AFM because AFM is limited to the topological analysis . De - roofing and detergent extraction of the plasma membrane Much work has been done to overcome the limits of topological analysis and to investigate intra - cellular structures by AFM imaging ( Melling et al . , AFM imaging of membrane proteins and microfilaments 601 2003 ; Franz and Mu ̈ ller , 2005 ; Meller and Theiss , 2006 ) . To remove the plasma membrane of cells , two approaches , de - roofing by short ultrasonic burst and detergent extraction , have been demonstrated ( Heuser , 2000 ; Berdyyeva et al . , 2005 ) . The ultrastructural insight into the architec - ture of focal adhesions in de - roofed cells was provided by AFM topographs complemented with optical microscopy ( Franz and Mu ̈ ller , 2005 ) . Furthermore , this application offers accurate height information of focal adhesion and insight into the organization of microfilaments . Several reports describe investigations of intra - cellular cytoskeletal structures after detergent extraction using the nonionic detergent Triton X - 100 ( Berdyyeva et al . , 2005 ; Meller and Theiss , 2006 ) . A method of permeabilization and embe - dding of lens epithelial cells was used to study the organization and distribution of intracellular pro - teins with AFM and confocal microscopy ( Meller and Theiss , 2006 ) . In this study , confocal micro - scopy was used to identify actin microfilaments by fluorescent labeling with rhodamine phalloidin , whereas AFM enabled the study of three - dimen - sional structures of microfilaments at the molecular level in fixed and living cells . Berdyyeva et al . ( 2005 ) described a novel application of AFM to directly visualize cytoskeletal fibers in human foreskin epithelial cells . In this approach , they used Triton X - 100 to remove the membrane , soluble proteins , and organelles from the cell . After detergent extraction , the remaining cytoskeleton was directly imaged under either liquid or air - dried ambient conditions . While imaging in liquid has been used to observe the cytoskeleton near the top of cells , imaging under air was performed to visualize both surface filaments and the total volume of the cytoskeletal fibers . Imaging in semi - in situ environment De - roofing and detergent extraction to remove the plasma membrane may cause damage to samples during their preparation ( Svitkina et al . , 1995 ; Small et al . , 1999 ; Berdyyeva et al . , 2005 ) . Re - cently , we reported a semi - in situ system through photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) to study the ultras - tructure of microfilaments without additional treat - ment and under near - native conditions ( Jung et al . , 2009a ) . PDT is an anticancer modality that uses photosensitizers preferentially accumulated in cancer cells ( Almeida et al , 2004 ; Ferreira et al , 2004 ; Tsai et al , 2005 ; Uzdensky et al , 2005 ; Lim et al . , 2009 ) . Subsequent activation of photosensitizer in target cells or tissues by light of an appropriate wavelength causes a cascade of biological events through various photophysical pathways , which induce production of reactive oxygen species , elevation of intracellular Ca 2 + , activation of caspases , and translocation of apoptosis - inducing factor , and ultimately result in cell death through apoptosis or necrosis ( Almeida et al , 2004 ; Ferreira et al , 2004 ; Tsai et al , 2005 ; Yoo et al . , 2009 ) . In bladder cancer cells , PDT induced conversion of intracellular into extracellular microfilaments , and the extracellular microfilaments formed by PDT was subjected to AFM ( Jung et al . , 2009a ) . AFM imaging of the microfilaments showed a stranded helical structure . This approach enabled us to investigate microfilaments at the molecular level under a semi - in situ environment . On - stage labeling and imaging Although AFM provides ultrastructural information at the molecular level , it is difficult to identify intracellular biomolecules because the technique is limited to the analysis of surface topology . To overcome this limitation , a combination of AFM and confocal microscopy has been recognized as an alternative method for the investigation of biolo - gical materials with high resolution ( Franz and Mu ̈ ller , 2005 ; Sharma et al . , 2005 ; Duman et al , 2010 ) . It would be both convenient and useful to directly install AFM on a confocal microscope , but there may be compatibility issues between the two . Thus , a tandem imaging method was introduced to allow comparative analysis of AFM and confocal microscopic images obtained in the same scanning field without co - installation of two pieces of imaging equipment ( Jung et al . , 2009a ) . This approach is very useful for both identification and high - reso - lution imaging of certain proteins in a complex mixture such as cells . Although intracellular components can be identified by the combinatory or tandem imaging method , an alternative method is required to identify ultrastructural components of cells , which are not detectable with confocal microscopy due to its limited resolution . On - stage labeling and ima - ging , based on a previous report ( Jung et al . , 2009a ) , can provide be a solution to overcome this limitation . In this new approach , pre - imaging , labeling , and post - imaging are sequentially perfor - med in aqueous solution without moving samples on the scanner tube of AFM . A coverslip with fixed cells is mounted on a scanner tube and AFM imaging is performed ( pre - imaging ) . After pre - ima - ging , the fluid cell is perfused with a labeling molecule in a buffer solution to probe target components of cells . Various molecules , including antibodies , toxins , peptides or conjugated nanopar - 602 Exp . Mol . Med . Vol . 42 ( 9 ) , 597 - 605 , 2010 Figure 2 . Identification of microfila - ments by on - stage labeling / imaging . Samples mounted on the scanner tube are sequentially imaged in aqueous solution by AFM before ( pre - imaging ) and after ( post - label - ing ) labeling with molecular probes including antibodies . Line profiles from pre - imaging ( from a to b ) and post - imaging ( from a ' to b ' ) are compared . ticles , can be used to label the target molecules . After washing with the buffer solution , AFM imaging is performed at the same position ( post - imaging ) . Figure 2 shows a possible sche - matic of on - stage labeling and imaging for the identification of microfilaments by AFM . This new approach can be used for the simultaneous identification and analysis of ultrastructural compo - nents of cells at the molecular level , which is not likely with other approaches . In addition , this on - stage approach will be more useful when it is used in parallel with the hybrid AFM - confocal microscopy , because on - stage labeling can be evaluated with confocal microscopy before on - stage imaging is performed with AFM . Furthermore , this on - stage labeling and imaging method has a potential to be developed into immuno - AFM . High - speed AFM imaging The image acquisition time in AFM might be too long to analyze biomolecular processes in real time because they generally occur on a millisecond or less ( Ando et al . , 2008a ) . Recently , improvement of the AFM tip and feedback control system has resulted in the development of high - speed AFM . The imaging rate of high - speed AFM is more than 30 frames per second and it enabled researchers to study dynamic biomolecular processes such as protein - protein interactions ( Ando et al . , 2008a , 2008b ) and DNA - enzyme interactions ( Hansma et al . , 2006 ) . For example , Gilmore’s group revealed single - molecule dynamics of the DNA - enzyme complexes with high - speed AFM ( Gilmore et al . , 2009 ) . Ando ' s group used high - speed AFM for studying dynamic behavior of actin and myosin V ( Ando et al . , 2008b ) . In addition , high - speed AFM can allow investigators to trace morphological changes of cells after external stimulus in real time . Thus , high - speed AFM has a strong potential for visualization of microfilament dynamics in cells . Conclusion AFM is becoming a powerful technique for the ultrastructural study of biological samples because it can provide high - resolution images without causing damage during sample preparation and scanning . Recently , efforts towards the investiga - tion of membrane proteins and microfilaments using AFM have increased to study dynamic events within cells . Various membrane channels were successfully analyzed by the topological imaging of AFM , and the force spectroscopy was very useful in force mapping of membrane receptors . Although microfilaments were succe - ssfully imaged by AFM through additional treat - ments such as de - roofing or detergent extraction , cell shrinkage using external stimuli such as PDT AFM imaging of membrane proteins and microfilaments 603 can be an alternative method for the investigation of intracellular structures using AFM . Identification of ultrastructural components of cells is one of the big challenges to be resolved . AFM force mapping will be helpful in identification of subcellular components under physiological conditions or in fixed cells . On - stage labeling and imaging approach can also provide simultaneous ultrastructural images and identification of molecu - les such as proteins in cells .
