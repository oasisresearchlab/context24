ABSTRACT Background / Objective . The COVID - 19 epidemic is particularly serious in older adults . The symptomatology and epidemic profile remain little known in this population , especially in disabled oldest - old people with chronic diseases living in nursing homes . The objective of the present study was to comprehensively describe symptoms and chronological aspects of the diffusion of the SARS - CoV - 2 virus in a nursing home , among both residents and caregivers . Design . Five - week retrospective cohort study . Setting . A middle - sized nursing home in Maine - et - Loire , west of France . Participants . Eighty - seven frail older residents ( 87 . 9±7 . 2years ; 71 % female ) and 92 staff members ( 38 . 3±11 . 7years ; 89 % female ) were included . Measurements . Mass screening for SARS - CoV - 2 was performed in both residents and staff . Attack rate , mortality rate , and symptoms among residents and staff infected with SARS - CoV - 2 were recorded . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 3 Results . The attack rate of COVID - 19 was 47 % in residents ( case fatality rate , 27 % ) , and 24 % in staff . Epidemic curves revealed that the epidemic started in residents before spreading to caregivers . Residents exhibited both general and respiratory signs ( 59 % hyperthermia , 49 % cough , 42 % polypnea ) together with geriatric syndromes ( 15 % falls , 10 % altered consciousness ) . The classification tree revealed 100 % COVID - 19 probability in the following groups : i ) residents younger than 90 with dyspnea and falls ; ii ) residents older than 90 with anorexia ; iii ) residents older than 90 without anorexia but with altered consciousness . Finally , 41 % of staff members diagnosed with COVID - 19 were asymptomatic . Conclusions . The pauci - symptomatic expression of COVID - 19 in older residents , together with the high prevalence of asymptomatic forms in caregivers , justifies mass screening in nursing homes , possibly prioritizing residents with suggestive combinations of clinical signs including dyspnea , falls , anorexia and / or altered consciousness . Keywords : COVID - 19 ; SARS - CoV - 2 ; prognosis ; symptoms ; older adults ; nursing home 1 INTRODUCTION Since December 2019 , the SARS - CoV - 2 virus is propagating worldwide from China . As of 4 May 2020 , the COVID - 19 pandemic has infected more than 3 500 000 people in 194 countries around the world , leaving 248 800 dead , mostly in frail older adults aged 70 years and over . First epidemiological data confirm that older adults are more prone to develop severe and lethal forms of COVID - 19 [ 1 ] . Clinical data regarding older patients’ symptomatology are yet limited [ 2 ] , and the first report on oldest - old people ( i . e . , aged 80 years and over ) with major neurocognitive disorders revealed clinical peculiarities that make difficult to diagnose COVID - 19 during the first days of the infection [ 3 ] . What is more , previous studies described individuals for whom tests had been performed following a clinical suspicion , which could have biased the prevalence of some symptoms [ 3 ] . Thus , specific J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 attention should be paid to older people in nursing homes for whom mass screening had been organized . Whilst residents of nursing homes seem seriously affected by the SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 4 ] , clinical and epidemiological data remain yet fragmented thus far [ 5 , 6 ] . The objective of the present study was to clarify symptoms and chronological aspects of the propagation of the SARS - CoV - 2 in a nursing home , both in residents and staff members . 2 METHODS 2 . 1 Design and settings The study consisted in a five - week retrospective observational cohort study in a middle - sized nursing home in Maine - et - Loire , West of France , having performed COVID - 19 mass screening of residents ( n = 87 ) and staff members ( n = 92 ) . The nursing home is dedicated to patients with major neurocognitive disorders combined with behavioral disturbances . The facility includes 86 apartments ( with one couple living in a single apartment ) , along with communal dining , library , and activity areas . The nursing home is divided into five units : one day care unit , one open unit , and three secured closed units . The open unit is dedicated to patients with mild major neurocognitive disorders but poor autonomy . Closed units are dedicated to patients with severe behavioral disturbances including wandering . All 87 residents were allowed to move around the building until 16 March 2020 , while social distancing and other preventive measures were implemented . Residents were isolated in their rooms with no communal meals or group activities . No visitors , including families , were allowed in the nursing home since 10 March 2020 . Walks in the garden were organized for the residents one by one , in the presence of one staff member . Residents could receive and update their families by phone or video . Mail and packages were stored 24h before being delivered to residents . Enhanced hygiene measures were implemented , including cleaning and J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 disinfection of frequently touched surfaces , permanent face masks , and additional hand hygiene stations for staff members . In total , 92 individuals were working as staff members during the study . The teams change three times a day , i . e . in the morning , in the afternoon and at night . The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards set forth in the Helsinki Declaration ( 1983 ) . No participant objected to the use of anonymized clinical and biological data for research purposes . The study was approved by an independent institutional review board under the number 2020 / 51 . The study protocol was declared to the National Commission for Information Technology and civil Liberties ( CNIL ) under number ar20 - 0053v0 . 2 . 2 Data Collection Residents’ clinical signs and results of the reverse - transcriptase – polymerase - chain - reaction ( RT - PCR ) tests were retrospectively obtained by reviewing medical records of the nursing home from 17 March 2020 . Staff members’ clinical signs and results of the RT - PCR tests were retrospectively obtained from the nursing home coordinating doctor . Data were censored at the time of data cutoff , which occurred on 26 April 2020 . Infection with COVID - 19 was defined for both residents and staff members as a positive result on RT - PCR tests of a specimen collected with nasopharyngeal swab in accordance with the World Health Organization standards [ 7 ] . Five residents had a test in hospital due to suggestive symptoms between 6 March 2020 and 24 March 2020 , before tests were made available outside of the hospital . Other residents and staff members had a test as part of the mass screening on 2 April 2020 ( 5 staff members ) , 6 April ( 2 residents and 3 staff members ) , 8 April ( 18 residents and 6 staff members ) , 9 April ( 13 residents and 10 staff members ) , 14 April ( 18 residents and 12 staff members ) , 15 April ( 18 staff members ) , 16 April ( 16 residents and 14 staff members ) , 21 April ( 7 staff members ) and 23 April 2020 ( 7 staff members ) . For J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 patients who died without RT - PCR test , the cause of death indicated on the death certificate ( i . e . related or not to COVID - 19 ) was collected . The following measures were collected for each resident : demographic ( age , gender , residence unit ) , vaccinal status regarding influenza virus for the current year , clinical signs , date and result of the RT - PCR test , hospitalization ( all - cause or specifically due to COVID - 19 ) , and mortality ( all - cause or specifically due to COVID - 19 ) . Finally , medical history of residents was extracted for the whole population using the PATHOS data [ 8 ] . The mean weighted PATHOS is used in nursing homes to describe the care profile of residents . In fact 49 pertinent pathological statuses ( but not the whole ICD 10 ) are described , including major neurocognitive disorders or abdominal pain for instance . Each pathological status is qualified by one of the 12 possible care profiles according to the clinical context ( e . g . , profile T2 : requiring multiweekly medical supervision and 24 - hour nursing care ) . The following measures were collected for each staff member : date and result of the RT - PCR test , date of first COVID - 19 symptoms if applicable , and position in the nursing home by distinguishing between caregivers ( i . e . physician , nurses , assistant nurses , animator , physiotherapist , occupational therapist , psychomotrician ) , non - caregivers who had contact with residents ( i . e . restaurant , laundry and housekeepers ) , and non - caregivers who had no contact with residents ( administrative functions ) . 2 . 3 Statistical analyses The participants’ characteristics were summarized using mean and standard deviation ( SD ) , median and 95 % confidence interval ( 95CI ) , or frequency and percentage , as appropriate . Normality of data was assessed using Kolmogorov - Smirnov test . First , the case fatality rate ( i . e . , the number of deaths from COVID - 19 divided by the total number of people diagnosed with COVID - 19 during the study ) , the attack rate ( i . e . , the number of new cases during the study divided by the number of residents ) , and the person - J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 7 time incidence rate per 100 person - days ( i . e . , as the number of new cases during the study divided by the sum of persons exposed each day during the study [ considering that each new case was no longer exposed after COVID - 19 diagnosis ] divided by 100 ) were calculated . Each positive case was excluded from people exposed either on the date of the first symptom , or on the date of the positive RT - PCR test for asymptomatic people , or on the date of work disruption for staff members when the two previous conditions were not met . For those with positive RT - PCR test but no symptoms , the date of the screening test was used to calculate the incidence rate . Second , participants were divided into three groups according to the COVID - 19 status , i . e . the “COVID - 19 group” for those with a positive RT - PCR test or death attributed to COVID - 19 , the “non - COVID - 19 group” for those with a negative RT - PCR test or death not attributed to COVID - 19 , and the “non - tested group” for the survivors with no RT - PCR test . Comparisons were performed using Chi square test or exact Fisher test for qualitative variables , and Student t test or Mann - Whitney U test for quantitative variables , as appropriate . Third , a classification tree ( Chi - square Automatic Interaction Detector , CHAID ) was performed using all available residents’ data at once [ 9 ] . The CHAID analysis is an algorithm used for discovering relationships between a categorical response variable ( i . e . , COVID - 19 here ) and other categorical predictor variables ( i . e . , all clinical variables collected as part of the study ) . It splits a parent group into two subgroups ( “nodes” ) within which covariates are homogenous and between which outcome is distinct . The CHAID analysis is useful when looking for patterns in datasets with lots of categorical variables and is a convenient way of summarizing the data as the relationships can be easily visualized . Here , we forced the use of age 90 years ( median ) as the first split , and the CHAID analysis was adjusted for age . The probability of COVID - 19 ( relative risk with 95CI ) was calculated for each end node using the end node with the lowest prevalence of COVID - 19 as a reference ( node 7 ) [ 10 ] . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 8 Two - sided P - values were considered as significant if < 0 . 05 . All statistics were performed using SPSS ( v23 . 0 ; IBM corp , Chicago , IL ) . 3 RESULTS A total of 87 residents ( mean±SD age , 87 . 9±7 . 2 years ; 71 % female ) and 92 staff members ( mean , 38 . 3±11 . 7 years ; 89 % female ) were included in the study . As illustrated in Figure 1 , the first confirmed COVID - 19 cases were reported on 17 and 27 March 2020 for residents and staff members , respectively . Seventy - seven residents were tested for COVID - 19 between 6 March and 16 April 2020 ( 10 deaths before testing ) , and 84 ( 91 . 3 % ) staff members between 2 and 23 April 2020 . The attack rate was 47 % in residents , and 24 % in staff members . The incidence rate was 1 . 54 per 100 persons - days among residents , and 0 . 88 persons - days among staff members ( respectively , 0 . 48 among caregivers , 0 . 36 among non - caregivers with contact to residents , and 0 . 04 among non - caregivers without contact ) ( Figure 1 ) . The case fatality rate was 27 % among residents . The all - cause mortality rate was 15 % among residents , compared 3 % on average during the same period in the preceding five years . No staff members died during the study period . Epidemic curves revealed that the epidemic started in residents , and then spread to caregivers , non - caregivers and finally to staff members with no contact to the residents ( Figure 1 ) . Demographic characteristics and medical history of residents are detailed in Table 1 . Residents exhibited 13 chronic pathological statuses on average . Among all residents , 41 had a confirmed infection with SARS - CoV - 2 ( mean , 89 . 0±6 . 9 years ; 66 % female ) . As illustrated in Table 2 , the most frequent symptoms retrieved in COVID - 19 residents were thermal changes ( n = 28 , 68 % ) ; 59 % of patients having hyperthermia ( i . e . , temperature > 38°C ) and 10 % hypothermia ( i . e . , temperature < 36°C ) . Dyspnea was retrieved in 61 % ( n = 25 ) of COVID - 19 , with 46 % of low pulse oximetry ( n = 19 ) and 42 % of polypnea ( n = 17 ) . Twenty J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 ( 49 % ) COVID - 19 residents presented with cough ( n = 20 ) , 14 ( 34 % ) with marked asthenia , and 5 ( 12 % ) with diarrhea . It is noticeable that the comparison with non - COVID - 19 residents showed multiple symptomatic differences , in particular a greater number of simultaneous clinical signs ( Table 2 ) . Finally , 3 COVID - 19 residents ( 7 % ) were totally asymptomatic and finally diagnosed through mass screening . All of them had major neurocognitive disorders related to alcohol use . One had hypertension and mild chronic renal failure , another one had hypertension and moderate chronic renal failure , and the last one had polyvascular disease with brain and heart lesions . The classification tree identified 7 end groups among residents for the prediction of COVID - 19 ( Figure 2 ) . The first split was dyspnea below 90 years of age , and anorexia above 90 years . Among individuals younger than 90 and without dyspnea , those who reported no cough formed the end node with the lowest prevalence of COVID - 19 ( 6 % ; node 7 ) . Compared to this reference node , the probability of COVID - 19 was 7 . 4 - fold higher among those older than 90 without anorexia and without altered consciousness ( 43 % COVID - 19 ) , 7 . 9 - fold higher among those younger than 90 without dyspnea but with cough ( 46 % COVID - 19 ) , and 10 . 2 - fold higher among those younger than 90 with dyspnea but no falls ( 60 % COVID - 19 ) . Finally , we found a 100 % COVID - 19 probability in the following groups : i ) those younger than 90 with dyspnea and falls ; ii ) those older than 90 with anorexia ; iii ) those older than 90 without anorexia but with altered consciousness . Table 3 presents the characteristics of the staff members . In total , 22 had a confirmed infection with SARS - CoV - 2 ( mean , 38 . 1±11 . 3 years ; 96 % female ) . Caregivers represented 64 % ( n = 14 ) of infected staff members , non - caregivers with contact to residents 32 % ( n = 7 ) , and staff members without contact to residents 5 % ( n = 1 ) . Most frequent symptoms were fever ( 32 % , n = 7 ) , general signs ( i . e . asthenia , anorexia , myalgia ) ( 27 % , n = 6 ) , cough ( 23 % , n = 5 ) , and ENT signs ( 18 % , n = 4 ) . Nine staff members were asymptomatic and identified through J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 mass screening . 4 DISCUSSION The present report of COVID - 19 mass screening in a nursing home showed a high prevalence of asymptomatic infected staff members , and confirmed that older residents exhibit few and mainly nonspecific symptoms . We were nevertheless able to clarify the symptomatology of COVID - 19 residents , and to specify three different clinical profiles of residents with 100 % infection within a nursing home affected by the SARS - CoV - 2 . This monocentric observational study contributes to emerging understanding of the presentation and trajectory of COVID - 19 in nursing - home residents . This case series showed that frail older adults exhibit relatively few symptoms , and notably less often fever , cough [ 11 ] and ENT signs [ 12 ] than younger adults . In this sense , our results are consistent with the few previous studies on symptoms met in older adults infected with COVID - 19 [ 2 , 3 ] . It is also consistent with the clinical presentation of other viral infections in older adults such as influenza [ 13 ] . Here , the residents exhibited both general and respiratory signs ( 59 % hyperthermia , 49 % cough , 42 % polypnea ) together with gastro - intestinal signs ( 12 % diarrhea ) and geriatric syndromes ( 15 % falls , 10 % altered consciousness ) . Surprisingly , delirium was less frequent compared to one previous report in adults aged 70 and over ( 7 % here versus 26 . 7 % previously ) [ 3 ] . This may be explained by the characteristics of the present sample , which involved mainly frail older residents with major neurocognitive disorders and behavioral disturbances . Delirium is commonly under - recognized when superimposed to major neurocognitive disorders , especially during the severe stages of the disease since a clear distinction between symptoms attributable to delirium or to underlying dementia proves difficult [ 14 ] . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 11 We also found that the COVID - 19 disease was asymptomatic in 8 % of the residents . This result is in accordance with recent results reporting 5 % of asymptomatic patients ( 3 / 57 ) in a nursing facility [ 15 ] . It suggests that COVID - 19 may have either non - expressive forms , or nonspecific symptoms that have gone unnoticed , or symptoms not expressed by older adults with advanced cognitive disorders . Moreover , positive RT - PCR for SARS - CoV - 2 was found in the absence of any symptom in 41 % of the staff members ; a large group likely involving both asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals [ 16 ] . These findings encourage systematic screening in nursing homes of all residents and staff members , starting with caregivers . Our classification tree is thought to be an interesting tool to assist clinicians in prioritizing tests and in rapid decision - making for older residents . Three clinical profiles should particularly draw the clinicians’ attention as they were associated with 100 % COVID - 19 probability in our study . These are residents i ) younger than 90 with dyspnea and falls , ii ) older than 90 with anorexia , and iii ) older than 90 without anorexia but with altered consciousness . Thus , even if these results need to be confirmed by further and preferentially prospective analyses , it seems reasonable , in a nursing home affected by COVID - 19 epidemic , to quickly isolate residents with one of these combinations of symptoms , and to test them as a priority to make the diagnosis of COVID - 19 . We found a case fatality rate of 27 % , consistent with previous findings ranging between 26 % and 33 . 7 % in similar populations [ 15 , 17 ] . Such high lethality rate in older patients should be considered in light of the worldwide COVID - 19 lethality rate for all ages , which is around 7 % [ 18 ] . The over - mortality in older patients was early reported by Wang et al . [ 19 ] and by the Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team [ 20 ] . It is likely explained by the higher prevalence of severe infections in older patients compared to younger ones , due to the higher prevalence of multimorbidity leading to J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 12 cascading decompensation in this population [ 21 , 22 ] . Consistently , the studied residents exhibited 13 chronic pathological statuses on average here . Finally , we found that the attack rate was 47 % among the residents in our study , which was close to the 43 . 5 % rate previously established in a call center in South Korea [ 23 ] , but twice as high as the attack rate among the staff members . This differential was possibly explained by a presymptomatic phase among staff members [ 16 ] as they were affected by SARS - CoV - 2 later than the residents . In our study , it is noticeable that the epidemic started in the nursing home among residents ( Figure 1 ) and then spread to staff . Since residents were unable to leave the nursing home , this suggests that the SARS - CoV - 2 was likely imported into the nursing home by a family member before containment and before visiting bans . Thus , the isolation measures from the outside imposed by some governments appear justified to limit and slow down the spread of the virus in nursing homes . However , such isolation of residents also raises questions about the quality of life of those with short life expectancy . Many initiatives are proposed in nursing homes to keep social life during this period , i . e . animations in corridors , music playing , individual walks , individual activities in the garden , sports coach , singing activities , or dematerialized communications with relatives ; all alternative solutions , the degree of satisfaction of which needs to be evaluated ( NCT04333849 ) . Our study has some limitations . First , it is an observational study conducted on a relatively limited sample of older adults living in a single nursing home and who may be not fully representative of the general population of residents as they all suffered from major neurocognitive disorders . Second , even if data were collected each day during the epidemic in a standardized manner , recall and reporting bias in retrospective studies cannot be ruled out especially regarding the symptoms of staff members . Third , the diagnosis of COVID - 19 was based either on death certificate or RT - PCR test , although the first one assumes a high clinical J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 13 probability but no biological confirmation of COVID - 19 , and the second one suffers from a relatively low sensitivity of 72 % with high risk of false negatives [ 24 ] . 5 CONCLUSION In conclusion , the pauci - symptomatic expression of COVID - 19 in older residents , together with the high prevalence of asymptomatic forms in caregivers , justifies conducting mass screening in nursing homes , possibly prioritizing residents with suggestive combinations of clinical signs including dyspnea , falls , anorexia and / or altered consciousness . Moreover , the finding of an initial contamination likely brought by non - professional visitors encourages isolation measures in nursing homes to break the contamination chain .
