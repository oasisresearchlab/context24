Talin ( 2541 amino acids ) is composed of a globular head ( residues 1 – 400 ) , containing a FERM domain , connected to a ﬂexible rod ( residues 482 – 2541 ) by a short linker sequence contain - ing a calpain - II cleavage site ( Critchley , 2004 ) . The FERM F3 subdomain contains a binding site for the b - integrin cyto - plasmic domain , and recent structural studies have provided a detailed understanding of how F3 recognises both the NPxY motif ( Garcia - Alvarez et al , 2003 ) and membrane proximal sequences within the b - integrin cytodomain ( Wegener et al , 2007 ) . The talin rod is made up of a series of amphipathic helical bundles , a number of which contain binding sites for the cytoskeletal protein vinculin ( Papagrigoriou et al , 2004 ; Gingras et al , 2005 ) , which is thought to stabilise focal adhesions ( Saunders et al , 2006 ) , possibly by crosslinking talin to F - actin . Vinculin recognises a series of hydrophobic residues on one side of a helix ( Gingras et al , 2005 ) ; both X - ray and NMR structures show that these residues are buried in the core of the helical bundle , which must unfold to allow vinculin binding . Indeed , intact talin binds vinculin with low afﬁnity ( Patel et al , 2006 ) ; the mechanisms for activating the vinculin - binding sites in the talin rod remain to be deter - mined . The talin rod also contains a second integrin - binding site ( residues 1984 – 2113 ) that appears to be essential for focal adhesion assembly ( Moes et al , 2007 ) , although it is unclear how b - integrin interacts with this site . Finally , the C - terminal region of talin ( residues 2300 – 2541 ) contains a binding site for F - actin ( Hemmings et al , 1996 ) that is homologous to that in the yeast protein Sla2p , the huntingtin - interacting protein HIP1 , and the related protein HIP1R . This highly conserved domain has been referred to as an I / LWEQ motif ( McCann and Craig , 1997 ) or more recently the THATCH ( talin / HIP1R / Sla2p actin tethering C - terminal homology ) domain ( Brett et al , 2006 ) . This region of talin is predicted to contain six helices ; the N - terminal is the least conserved and appears to negatively regulate actin binding , while the C - terminal helix is required for talin dimerisation ( Senetar et al , 2004 ) . Here , we report the NMR structure of talin residues 2300 – 2482 , a ﬁve - helix bundle , which has a similar structure to the HIP1R THATCH core domain , and the crystal structure of helix 6 that forms an antiparallel dimer . Small - angle X - ray scattering ( SAXS ) together with these two structures allows us to propose a model for the entire talin 2300 – 2541 dimer , which is elongated in solution . We have mapped the residues involved in actin binding in the ﬁve - helix bundle to one face of the domain . Binding requires dimerisation , and is negatively regulated by helix 1 , which is on the opposite face Received : 2 August 2007 ; accepted : 29 November 2007 ; published online : 20 December 2007 * Corresponding author .

Electron microscopy , interpreted with the help of the overall shape of the dimer determined by SAXS , establishes how the dimer interacts with actin ﬁlaments and positions the N termini accessible and on opposite sides of the ﬁlaments . Results Structure of the C - terminal actin - binding domain of talin Initially , we used secondary structure prediction and NMR spectroscopy of a range of constructs to identify a talin polypeptide containing the C - terminal actin - binding site suit - able for NMR structure determination ( see Supplementary Results and Supplementary Figure S1 ) . These studies demon - strated the presence of a stable globular domain ( residues 2300 – 2482 ) connected by a ﬂexible linker to a helical dimerisation domain ( residues 2496 – 2529 ) . The structure of talin 2300 – 2482 comprises ﬁve antiparallel a - helices ( Figure 1A and B ; see also Supplementary Results and Supplementary Figure S2D ) , as described for the homologous HIP1R actin - binding domain ( referred to as the THATCH core ) ( Brett et al , 2006 ) . The helical bundle is stabilised by hydrophobic inter - actions . There are hydrophobic cores at each end of the bundle separated by a set of small hydrophilic side chains ( Thr 2356 , 2404 , 2435 and Ser 2467 ) reminiscent of the ‘threonine belt’ observed in the structure of talin 782 – 889 ( Fillingham et al , 2005 ) . The hydrophobic core at the N - terminal end of the bundle is arranged around the aromatic ring of Trp 2389 ( Supplementary Figure S2C ) and incorpo - rates the side chain of the conserved Gln 2367 , which points into the bundle . The core at the C - terminal end is made up of the hydrophobic side chains of Leu , Ile and Val residues , and is capped by the aromatic ring of Phe 2341 . Helices 2 and 3 are the longest ( 32 residues ) , while the other three are approximately two turns shorter ( 22 – 27 residues ) . Helix 2 is connected to the neighbouring helices by long loops ( 14 and 9 residues ) , while the other two loops are relatively short ( 4 – 5 residues ) . The long loop between helices 1 and 2 is unstructured and highly dynamic , as indicated by sharp NMR resonances and the lack of NOEs ( Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S2A ) . The loop between helices 2 and 3 has restricted mobility due to the hydrophobic contacts made by the Val 2376 side chain and the presence of Pro 2380 . As predicted from sequence homology ( Figure 1A ) , the structure most similar to the C - terminal actin - binding domain of talin is that of the HIP1R THATCH core domain ( Brett et al , 2006 ) , which shows 35 % sequence identity . For the whole structure , a relatively high r . m . s . d . was obtained ( main - chain atoms 4 . 77 A˚ ; all heavy atoms 5 . 12 A˚ ) , but the r . m . s . d . was much lower for the helical regions ( main - chain atoms 2 . 92 A˚ ; all heavy atoms 3 . 37 A˚ ) ( Supplementary Figure S2B ) . Many structural features are conserved between the two helical bundles , and the majority of the conserved residues occupy similar positions . In particular , the side chain of Trp 2389 has the same orientation in both structures ( Supplementary Figure S2C ) , highlighting its role as a key residue in the hydrophobic core . However , there are also signiﬁcant differences between the two structures . Helices 1 , 2 and 5 are substantially shorter at the C - terminal end of the bundle than the equivalent helices in HIP1R , leading to a less elongated structure and the formation of the large unstruc - tured loop between helices 1 and 2 . The shortness of helix 1 can be attributed to the presence of Pro 2328 at the end of the helix , followed by a group of charged residues ( Figure 1A ) . The proline side chain makes contacts with the hydrophobic core and is positioned level with the ends of the other helices . The main difference at the N - terminal end of the bundle is the absence of the short capping helix a 3 0 that is present in the HIP1R structure ( Figure 1A and Supplementary Figure S2C ) . Instead , there is an extra helical turn in helix 3 , followed by a largely immobilised loop . It appears that the key residues for the formation and packing of the HIP1R capping helix are Phe 861 and Tyr 862 , which are absent in talin . In addition , Pro 2380 occupies a position corresponding to the middle of helix a 3 0 in HIP1R . The absence of the a 3 0 helix in talin affects the position of the N - terminal end of the helices . In the HIP1R structure , the a 3 0 helix is wedged between the ends of helices 1 and 2 , pushing helix 1 out . In talin , the absence of the capping helix allows helix 1 to move closer to helix 2 , resulting in a structure that looks more closed at the N - terminal end of the bundle than in HIP1R . Structure of the talin dimerisation domain Using secondary structure prediction and NMR , the optimal domain boundaries of the talin dimerisation domain were shown to be residues 2494 – 2541 ( see Supplementary Results and Supplementary Figure S3 ) . Large crystals that diffracted X - rays to 2 . 2 - A˚ resolution were readily obtained using sparse matrix screening , and the crystal structure was determined using single - wavelength anomalous diffraction from a sele - nomethionine derivative ( Supplementary Figure S4A , Supplementary Table SII and Supplementary Results ) . The two monomers in the asymmetric unit superimpose well onto one another ( average r . m . s . d . for main - chain atoms 0 . 34 A˚ , and for all heavy atoms 1 . 08 A˚ ) , the main differences between the monomers being the orientations of long side chains of solvent - exposed residues . Each monomer is composed of a long straight helix approximately 48A˚ in length ( Figure 2A ) . The helices form an antiparallel coiled - coil dimer with a small angle between the helices . The formation of the dimer buries approximately 30 % ( 1539A˚ 2 ) of the total surface area . Both ends of the dimer are nonpolar with a highly charged belt in the middle ( Figure 2B ) . There is a salt bridge cluster in the centre of the dimer formed by the side chains of K2511 and E2514 from each monomer , with the four side chains making intra - and intermolecular contacts within the cluster ( Supplementary Figure S4B ) . Additionally , intramolecular salt bridges are observed for E2516 / R2519 in both monomers , stabilising the helix ( Supplementary Figure S4C ) . Interestingly , E2507 from one of the monomers forms an intermolecular salt bridge with K2521 , while in the other monomer this residue forms an intramolecular salt bridge with R2510 ( Supplementary Figure S4B ) . In all other cases , the charged groups are too far apart to make a salt bridge and some of the side chains are hydrogen - bonded to nearby solvent molecules . No density was observed for the ﬁrst three residues at the N terminus of both monomers where a pair of glycines ( G2496 / G2497 ) destabilise the helix . The last 12 residues at the C - terminus ( 2530 – 2541 ) are also disordered and no density was observed in the crystal structure—this is consistent with [ 1 H , 15 N ] HSQC NMR spectra where a dozen Structure of talin C - terminal actin - binding domain AR Gingras et al & 2008 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 27 | NO 2 | 2008 459 Figure 1 Solution structure of the C - terminal actin - binding domain of talin ( residues 2300 – 2482 ) .

Most of these residues are conserved in the THATCH domains identiﬁed to date ( Brett et al , 2006 ) . Interestingly , the solvent - exposed residues Q2505 , L2509 , E2512 , L2515 , R2519 , R2526 and Y2530 are even more con - served ( Figure 2C and D ) and are clustered on one face of the dimer , resulting in a conserved surface made up of both charged and hydrophobic residues . These characteristics suggest that this surface may be involved in actin binding . Identiﬁcation of residues involved in actin binding The ﬁve - helix bundle that comprises the core of the C - terminal actin - binding domain of talin contains a number of conserved surface - exposed residues that are predominantly clustered on the face made up of helices 3 and 4 ( Figure 1C ) . This part of the surface consists of an extensive hydrophobic patch surrounded by positively charged groups ( Figure 1D ) , characteristics that make it a good candidate for a region involved in F - actin binding . Indeed , the actin - binding site in the HIP1R THATCH domain has been mapped to the equivalent surface ( Brett et al , 2006 ) . However , this surface is on the face of the domain opposite helix 1 , which has been shown to negatively regulate actin binding ( Senetar et al , 2004 ) . In addition , actin binding depends on the presence of the C - terminal dimerisation helix ( see below ) . To map the residues in talin 2300 – 2541 directly or indirectly involved in actin binding , we tested the effects of a series of mutations on its afﬁnity for F - actin .

The single mutations Q2388D , Q2437E , K2443D , V2444D and K2445D ( equivalent to those analysed in the HIP1R THATCH domain ; Brett et al , 2006 ) all caused a signiﬁcant reduction in F - actin binding ( Table I ) , and the triple mutant K2443D / V2444D / K2445D reduced binding to 27 % of wild type . Interestingly , although the Q2437E mutant reduced binding afﬁnity , the equivalent mutation in HIP1R ( Q916E ) increased binding . While this difference is puzzling , our results clearly demonstrate that incorporating acidic amino acids into the actin - binding surface of talin reduces binding . Both the Q2388D mutation in talin ( Supplementary Figure S5D and Table I ) and the equivalent R867D mutation in HIP1R reduce binding to F - actin ; interestingly , substituting talin Q2388 with arginine had no effect on binding , indicating that either a basic or an uncharged residue at this position can be tolerated . Talin D2447 , located close to the conserved basic residues K2443 and K2445 , is homologous to N926 in HIP1R and a talin D2447N mutant increased F - actin binding to 144 % that of wild type ( Figure 3D and Table I ) . Thus , reducing the acidic charge in the proximity of the conserved basic residues ( Figure 1C and D ) increases the ability of talin to bind F - actin . One of the key structural differences between the THATCH cores of talin and HIP1R is in the region between helices 2 and 3 , where a loop is observed in talin and a short a 3 0 helix in HIP1R ( Figure 1A ) . Valine 2376 in the loop contacts W2389 in the centre of the actin - binding site ( Figures 1C and 3A ) , and we therefore made a V2376D mutant to study the effects on binding of destabilising this loop . The [ 1 H , 15 N ] HSQC NMR spectrum of this mutant showed few changes in comparison with the wild - type protein , indicating that the protein adopted the correct fold , and its ability to bind F - actin was not affected ( Figure 3D ) . We conclude that this poorly conserved loop , which is located on the opposite side of the bundle , is probably not involved in F - actin binding , and that V2376 is not important for maintaining the hydrophobic core near W2389 . At the N terminus of helix 3 , there are two aspartate residues ( D2385 and D2386 ) that are near the conserved basic residues within the actin - binding site , and we therefore mutated these to the equivalent residues in HIP1R , that is , D2385K and D2386N ( Figure 3A ) . Interestingly , the double mutation produced only a small increase in binding ( Table I ) . Since we had already shown that a D2447N mutation increased binding signiﬁcantly ( 144 % ) , we made a triple mutant ( D2385K / D2386N / D2447N ) but this bound no better than the D2447N mutant alone . The sequence conservation around D2385 and D2386 is low and the structural features of talin and HIP1R are very different in this region , suggesting that it is not critical for F - actin binding . As described above , Q2388 on the adjacent helical turn of helix 3 could be mutated to arginine without any effect on F - actin binding , but a mutation to an acidic residue did reduce binding to 59 % of wild type ( Table I ) . Overall , the mutagenesis data show that exposed residues on two adjacent helical turns have very different effects on F - actin binding , indicating that the talin – actin contact site is a well - deﬁned hydrophobic patch surrounded by positively charged residues .

Summary of the results from F - actin co - sedimentation assays performed at 10 m M F - actin and 4 m M talin . Structure of talin C - terminal actin - binding domain AR Gingras et al & 2008 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 27 | NO 2 | 2008 463 The talin dimerisation domain is important for F - actin binding Complete removal of the dimerisation domain reduced F - actin binding to 22 % of the wild type ( Figure 3E and Table I ) . To check whether this effect is due to conversion of the dimer to the monomer , or to loss of additional contacts between the dimerisation domain itself and F - actin , we made a series of mutants designed to inhibit dimer formation with minimum effect on the properties of the helices . Three point mutants ( R2526G , L2515D and A2518D ) were all monomeric as determined by gel ﬁltration ( Supplementary Figure S6 ) and NMR , as was the double mutant L2515D / A2518D ( Table I ) . For these mutants , we observed a large increase in the number of sharp intense signals in the [ 1 H , 15 N ] HSQC spectra and an overall reduction in the resonance line - widths . The positions of the majority of the resonances corresponding to the ﬁve - helix bundle remain unchanged . We conclude that the above mutations lead to the complete unfolding of the dimerisation domain , while the ﬁve - helix bundle remains unperturbed . These mutants showed much reduced actin binding , although they did bind to actin signiﬁcantly better than the polypeptide lacking the entire dimerisation domain ( Table I ) , suggesting that the dimerisation domain may also interact with actin . Analysis of the sequence of the dimerisation domain shows that all the invariant residues cluster on one face of the domain ( Figure 2C and D ) . We have mutated two invariant basic residues , R2519 and R2526 , to alanine to reduce the overall positive charge of this surface ( Figure 3B ) . Surprisingly , these two mutants are monomeric ( Table I ) and as a result their F - actin - binding capacity was substantially reduced ( Figure 3E and Table I ) . The core of this antiparallel dimer is not a typical leucine zipper and is not highly hydrophobic . Indeed , the crystal structure shows many salt bridges between the two helices , and our mutational analysis suggests that they are critical to maintain a stable fold . We therefore mutated two conserved though not invariant residues ( R2510 and R2513 ) to alanine ( Figure 2C and D ) . R2510 is on the opposite face of the dimer and makes salt bridges to neighbouring residues ( Figure 2A ) , while R2513 is at the edge of the dimer and is not involved in any salt bridges ( Figure 3B ) . Gel ﬁltration and NMR data show that both mutants are dimeric ( Table I ) , but both showed a signiﬁcant decrease in F - actin binding ( Figure 3E , Table I and Supplementary S7C ) . Taken together , the data show that the dimerisation of the actin - binding domain is essential for F - actin binding , in agreement with the recent work of Smith and McCann ( 2007 ) , and also suggest that the dimerisation domain itself might contribute to binding through electro - static interactions . Effects of mutating the upstream helix on actin binding The N - terminal helix 1 of the actin - binding domain , also termed the upstream helix ( USH ) , was identiﬁed as a conserved structural element that decreases the actin - binding capacity of this family of proteins ( Senetar et al , 2004 ) . Removal of this helix in talin led to a 2 . 6 - fold increase relative to the full domain in the fraction of talin ( 2334 – 2541 ) bound to actin ( Figure 3F ) , in agreement with published data ( Senetar et al , 2004 ) . However , there was also a slight increase in the amount of this polypeptide that pelleted in the absence of F - actin ; NMR shows that removal of the USH alters the conformation of the domain , which may decrease stability and lead to a tendency to aggregate with time . The USH is anchored to the rest of the domain through nonpolar interactions involving L2309 , I2316 and L2323 ( Figure 3C ) , and the effect of mutating these residues on F - actin binding is shown in Figures 3F , Supplementary Figure S8 and Table I . The L2309A or L2323A mutations led to a small but re - producible increase in binding , while the double mutant ( L2309A / L2323A ) showed a larger increase in binding ( 154 % that of wild type ; Figure 3F ) . An increase in binding was also observed for the double mutant I2316A / L2323A ( 135 % ) , while no change was observed for the I2316A single mutant . Although none of the mutations increased binding to the same degree as removing the entire USH ( Table I ) , they had little effect on the solubility of the protein compared to removal of the entire USH . These results support previous conclusions that the USH negatively regulates actin binding , through a conformational mechanism , details of which remain unclear . SAXS analysis of the C - terminal actin - binding domain of talin shows an extended dimeric protein To investigate the overall shape of the talin 2300 – 2541 dimer , we carried out SAXS experiments . From the scattering proﬁle ( Figure 4A ) , the maximum linear dimension ( D max ) for the talin dimer is 124 ( 7 6 ) A˚ , suggesting that the dimer is elongated . Similarly , the distribution of scattering mass of the dimer ( as indicated by the radius of gyration , R g ) gives R g ¼ 37 . 0 ( 7 0 . 3 ) A˚ , a high value for a 52 - kDa dimer ; one would expect an R g value of B 25A˚ for a spherical particle of similar mass . These observations clearly demonstrate that the dimer is characterised by an extended non - globular arrange - ment of the THATCH domain , consistent with the results from analytical gel ﬁltration ( see Supplementary Results ) . Ab initio shape reconstructions from the experimental SAXS proﬁle alone using GASBOR ( Svergun et al , 2001 ) highlight the elongated shape of the dimeric talin 2300 – 2541 polypeptide ; the calculated molecular envelope is shown in Figure 4B . The high - resolution structures of the dimerisation helix and the ﬁve - helix bundle were used as rigid bodies to model the dimeric talin polypeptide using BUNCH ( Petoukhov and Svergun , 2005 ) . The BUNCH model is shown in Figure 4B superimposed on the model - indepen - dent shape reconstruction ( see also Supplementary movie ) . The ab initio shape and the rigid body model reconstructions were evaluated against the experimental scattering proﬁles assuming a two - fold symmetry constraint ; both reproduce the features of the experimental scattering proﬁles well ( Figure 4A ) . The arrangement of the two ﬁve - helix bundles in the dimer seems to be conserved , since all rigid body models yielded an angle of approximately 130 1 between their long axes . Interestingly , the angle between the two antiparallel helices in the dimerisation domain is approximately 120 1 . This may indicate an interaction between the bottom of the ﬁve - helix bundle and one face of the dimerisation domain ( possibly the conserved face described in Figure 2C ) ; the twist in the dimerisation domain would determine the arrangement of the two ﬁve - helix bundles . A number of residues might be involved in stabilising the observed domain arrangement within the dimer . These include a loop of 15 amino - acid residues between helices 1 and 2 that could contact the Structure of talin C - terminal actin - binding domain AR Gingras et al The EMBO Journal VOL 27 | NO 2 | 2008 & 2008 European Molecular Biology Organization 464 dimerisation domain , a segment of B 20 amino - acid residues between helix 5 and the dimerisation domain and a stretch of 14 residues at the C terminus of the dimerisation domain ( Figures 1A and 2D ) , totalling 49 residues ( 98 residues in the dimer ) . Comparison of the [ 1 H , 15 N ] HSQC spectra of ( i ) talin 2294 – 2541 , containing both the core ﬁve - helix bundle and the dimerisation domain , ( ii ) the ﬁve - helix bundle alone and ( iii ) two different polypeptides spanning the dimerisation domain ( residues 2494 – 2541 and 2481 – 2541 ) conﬁrms that the two domains interact . For example , G2496 and G2497 are mobile in the isolated dimerisation domain but become immobilised in talin 2294 – 2541 , as shown by severe broad - ening of the resonances . Similarly , residues 2532 – 2538 , which are C - terminal to the structured part of the dimerisa - tion domain are highly dynamic in the isolated domain , but become immobilised in talin 2294 – 2541 . The changes in dynamic properties indicate a direct interaction between the THATCH core domain and the N - and C - terminal ends of the dimerisation domain . However , the core domain retains a signiﬁcant degree of independent mobility within talin 2294 – 2541 , as indicated by the relatively modest increase in line widths of the NMR resonances relative to the isolated ﬁve - helix bundle . This suggests that the area of contact with the core domain is relatively small , and is probably at the C - terminal end of the domain . Electron microscopy of the C - terminal domain of talin bound to actin ﬁlaments To determine where the C - terminal domain of talin binds on the actin ﬁlament , we used the talin 2334 – 2541 construct lacking the USH , since it has a higher afﬁnity for F - actin . Differential scanning calorimetry ( DSC ) showed that this construct is properly folded and stable under the conditions used , and formation of a complex with F - actin was veriﬁed by co - sedimentation and DSC ( Supplementary Figure S9 ) . Using electron microscopy , extra density was visible decorating the actin ﬁlaments at both pH 7 . 0 and 7 . 5 in the presence of the talin construct ( Figure 5A arrows ) , clearly indicating binding . Two complementary image - reconstruction approaches for helically symmetric structures were applied to two indepen - dent data sets . The analysis of the resulting three - dimen - sional ( 3D ) reconstructions shows that the helical symmetry is consistent with the values reported for decorated actin ﬁlaments by us and others . However , difference mapping of reconstructions of F - actin with and without talin 2334 – 2541 did not provide any clear difference peaks that might correspond to the talin domain . Consequently , we used an image analysis approach that does not rely on helical symmetry . The resulting 3D reconstruction shows two distinct but connected densities attached to the ﬁlament ( Figure 5C ) . These densities are fully consistent in shape and size with the helical bundle of the Figure 4 SAXS data for the dimeric talin polypeptide 2300 – 2541 . ( A ) Experimental scattering proﬁle of the talin dimer ( red ) compared with the theoretical scattering curves from the shape reconstructed ab initio with GASBOR ( blue line ) , and the structural model of the dimer obtained with the rigid body modelling program BUNCH ( black line ) .

Structure of talin C - terminal actin - binding domain AR Gingras et al & 2008 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 27 | NO 2 | 2008 465 talin C - terminal domain . In fact , the SAXS - based dimer model ﬁts nicely into the extra density ( Figure 5D ) , indicating that the conformation of actin - bound dimers and dimers in solu - tion are similar . A minor twist ( 20 1 ) around the dimerisation domain ( Figure 5B ) improves the ﬁt dramatically and also increases contact area with the actin ﬁlament . The docking indicates that the talin domain binds to three monomers along the ﬁlament . Thus , it cannot support helical symmetry , explaining why the helical reconstructions did not show additional density that can be attributed to talin . The model places the two helical bundles towards two opposite sides of the ﬁlament . The upper bundle is placed close to subdomain 2 of the central actin monomer and is also close to the back ( C - terminal region ) of subdomain 1 of the upper actin monomer and the top of subdomain 1 of the central actin monomer . The lower talin helical bundle is close to the lowest actin monomer of the three - monomer interaction site . The dimerisation domain is close to the N terminus ( subdomain 1 ) of the central actin monomer . In this conﬁguration , residues implicated in actin binding by the mutagenesis experiments are placed close to the surface of F - actin . Discussion We have determined the solution structure of the talin C - terminal actin - binding domain , a ﬁve - helix bundle that has a similar fold to the HIP1R THATCH core domain ( Brett et al , 2006 ) . Using mutagenesis , we have deﬁned the actin - binding surface on the bundle as a region of highly conserved Figure 5 The C - terminal actin - binding site in talin binds to the sides of actin ﬁlaments .

Structure of talin C - terminal actin - binding domain AR Gingras et al The EMBO Journal VOL 27 | NO 2 | 2008 & 2008 European Molecular Biology Organization 466 residues forming a hydrophobic patch lined by basic residues . Binding to F - actin is negatively regulated by helix 1 ( the USH ) , on the opposite face of the bundle to this site , although the physiological signiﬁcance of this remains to be deter - mined . In the full - length protein , this domain is C - terminal to a series of helical bundles that make up the talin rod , and the mechanical force exerted on talin might weaken the inter - action between the USH and the core of the bundle , thereby increasing its afﬁnity for F - actin . An intriguing feature of proteins containing a THATCH domain is the C - terminal helix that seems to enhance actin binding by supporting dimer formation . Here , we describe for the ﬁrst time the structure of one of these domains , the talin dimerisation domain , which forms an antiparallel dimer . NMR indicates that additional intramolecular interactions between the unstructured regions N - and C - terminal to the dimerisation helix may also help to stabilise the antiparallel dimer . The structure suggests that full - length talin might adopt a wide variety of conformations , including an extended tail - to - tail dimer ( Figure 4C ) . This notion is supported by data showing that HIP1R is a rod - shaped dimer with globular heads at either end ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al , 2001 ) . Talin has previously been reported to form an antiparallel dimer ( Goldmann et al , 1994 ) , which is difﬁcult to reconcile with our results on the C - terminal domain . Mutagenesis of the dimerisation domain clearly demonstrates the importance of this domain in supporting high - afﬁnity actin binding . Intriguingly , most mutations in the dimerisation helix rendered the domain monomeric , and F - actin binding was markedly reduced ( Table I ) . However , we were able to identify two mutants ( R2510A and R2513A ) that retained the ability to form dimers while showing a reduction in F - actin binding , suggesting that the dimerisation domain itself might contribute to actin binding . Electron microscopy and image analysis studies together with DSC and co - sedimentation assays provide direct evidence for binding of the dimeric C - terminal domain of talin to ﬁlamentous actin . The 3D reconstruction indicates that the dimeric talin construct binds to three actin mono - mers along the long - pitch helix of the ﬁlament ( Figure 5 ) . This is surprising because most F - actin - binding proteins tend to bind two monomers ( McGough , 1998 ) , often involving a prominent hydrophobic pocket in the ﬁlament primarily composed of subdomain 1 ( Dominguez , 2004 ) with some contributions from subdomain 2 of the long - pitch neighbour below ( Volkmann et al , 2000 ) . In our model , the upper helical bundle of the talin dimer is indeed located close to this consensus binding site on F - actin , contacting two actin monomers along the long - pitch helix . This is consistent with the hydrophobic nature of the binding site determined by mutagenesis . The second talin helical bundle is mainly bound to the front of a single actin monomer right below these two , and the dimerisation domain is close enough to make contact with the negatively charged N - terminal region of subdomain 1 in the central actin monomer of the three . One consequence of this mode of binding and the intrinsic symmetry of the dimer is that there must be two non - equivalent modes of actin binding . This is consistent with a study on an isolated monomeric THATCH core domain ( Galkin et al , 2005 ) where two different modes of binding were identiﬁed . However , in contrast to that study , we were not able to observe F - actin binding by the monomeric talin ﬁve - helix bundle ( equivalent to the HIP1R THATCH core domain ) , indicating that both sets of contacts seen in our model are necessary to produce a stable complex . The model assumes that there are no major rearrangements between the domains in solution ( as determined by SAXS ) and the actin - bound form of the dimer . This assumption is fully consistent with the shape of the additional density , which can be accounted for well by docking the SAXS dimer structure into the density . A slight twist of the dimer bringing the helical bundles in a more parallel position results in an even better ﬁt . The model for the actin - bound dimer places the residues implicated in actin binding close to the ﬁlament surface and the N termini on two opposite sides of the actin ﬁlament . However , this assignment is not unique and shows only that there is no contradiction between the dimer placement in the model and the other data . The ﬁnding that the dimeric C - terminal actin - binding site of talin binds to a single actin ﬁlament explains why this domain fails to bundle actin ﬁlaments under the conditions used in this study . In contrast , Smith and McCann ( 2007 ) report that this domain has bundling activity , as determined by low - speed centrifugation and by negative stain electron microscopy . All our experiments using the construct lacking the USH were carried out within 24 – 48h of puriﬁcation , and the integrity of the fold was conﬁrmed by DSC . We found that the protein has a tendency to aggregate with time as detected by NMR , and this may explain the discrepancy between the two studies . It is well established that full - length talin has actin - bundling activity , as does the talin rod ( Schmidt et al , 1999 ) . However , it is important to note that talin contains at least two other regions that bind F - actin , namely the talin FERM domain ( Lee et al , 2004 ) and residues 951 – 1327 in the centre of the talin rod ( Hemmings et al , 1996 ) . It will be important to establish the role of each of these actin - binding sites in a cellular context . Initial studies using talin1 knockout cells have shown that the C - terminal region of talin is required to support coupling of surface - associated ﬁbronectin to the actin cytoskeleton ( Jiang et al , 2003 ) , but further studies are required to establish whether this was due to loss of the C - terminal actin - binding site or to the fact that the protein was monomeric . The results reported here pave the way for such studies . Materials and methods Protein expression and puriﬁcation Mouse talin1 cDNAs were ampliﬁed by PCR and cloned into either pET - 151 / D - TOPO ( Invitrogen ) or pETM - 20 ( EMBL , Heidelberg , Germany ) . Proteins were puriﬁed from Escherichia coli BL21 Star ( DE3 ) as previously described ( Gingras et al , 2006 ) . Recombinant talin 2494 – 2541 was expressed in the B834 strain of E . coli and cultured in minimal media containing selenomethionine . Protein concentrations were determined using their respective extinction coefﬁcient at 280nm . NMR spectroscopy NMR experiments for resonance assignment and structure determi - nation of the talin 2300 – 2482 fragment were performed with 1mM protein , 20mM sodium phosphate , 50mM NaCl , 2mM DTT , pH 6 . 0 , containing 10 % ( v / v ) 2 H 2 O . NMR spectra of talin 2300 – 2482 were obtained at 45 1 C using Bruker AVANCE DRX 600 and AVANCE DRX 800 spectrometers equipped with CryoProbes . Spectra were processed using TopSpin ( Bruker ) or NMRPipe ( Delaglio et al , 1995 ) and analysed using Analysis ( Vranken et al , 2005 ) . Backbone and side - chain assignments were obtained using standard triple - and double - resonance experiments . NMR structure calculations Structure of talin C - terminal actin - binding domain AR Gingras et al & 2008 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 27 | NO 2 | 2008 467 were performed as described previously ( Gingras et al , 2006 ) ; details are given in Supplementary Materials and methods , with structural statistics in Supplementary Table SI . The set of 20 lowest energy structures has been submitted to the Protein Data Bank under PDB code 2JSW . X - Ray crystallography Crystals of talin 2494 – 2541 were obtained at 19 1 C by vapour diffusion using 100mM citrate , 11 % ( w / v ) PEG 3000 , 200mM NaCl , pH 4 . 2 . Protein at 8 . 0mg / ml in 20mM Tris – HCl , 0 . 2M NaCl , 2mM DTT , pH 8 . 0 was mixed with an equal volume of precipitant . Crystals belong to the space group P4 1 32 with a , b , c ¼ 98 . 8A˚ , a , b , g ¼ 90 1 . The crystals contained one dimer per asymmetric unit with a solvent content of 66 . 4 % . Data sets were collected for native crystals at ESRF beamline ID23 - 1 , using an ADSC Q315R CCD detector , and for the selenomethionine derivative at ESRF , beamline 14 – 3 , using an ADSC Q4R CCD detector . The model converged to an R work of 25 . 7 % and R free of 31 . 5 % for all data between 30 and 2 . 2A˚ . The structure has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under PDB code 2QDQ . Figures were generated with PYMOL ( http : / / www . pymol . org ) and ccp4mg ( Potterton et al , 2002 ) . Actin co - sedimentation assays Muscle G - actin was puriﬁed from rabbit skeletal muscle ( Pardee and Spudich , 1982 ) and polymerised in 10mM Tris , 50mM NaCl , 100 m M ATP , 1mM DTT , 1mM MgCl 2 , pH 7 . 0 . Assays were performed using 4 m M talin and concentrations of F - actin ranging from 0 to 25 m M . The mixture was incubated for 60min at room temperature and centrifuged at 100000r . p . m . for 30min at 22 1 C using a Beckman Optima TM ultracentrifuge . Supernatants and pellets were analysed on 12 % SDS – PAGE gels , stained using Coomassie blue and scanned . Protein levels in the pellet were determined using Image J software ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / ) and normalised using talin loading controls ( 2 m M ) . Each mutant was analysed in triplicate . Solution X - ray scattering data collection and analysis SAXS experiments were carried out at station 2 . 1 of the Synchrotron Radiation Source at Daresbury using a multiwire gas detector covering a momentum transfer range of 0 . 02A˚ (cid:4) 1 o q o 0 . 70A˚ (cid:4) 1 with q ¼ 4 p sin Y / l ( where 2 Y is the scattering angle and l the X - ray wavelength of 1 . 54A˚ ) . Measurements on talin 2300 – 2541 were performed at 4 1 C , at concentrations of 2 and 10mg / ml in 20mM sodium phosphate , 50mM NaCl , 2mM DTT , pH 6 . 5 . Data were accumulated in 60 - s frames and before averaging , frames were inspected for X - ray - induced damage or aggregation . No protein aggregation was detected and the linearity of the Guinier plot ( Supplementary Figure S10 ) indicates that the protein solutions were homogeneous . The background was subtracted using the scattering from the buffer solution alone . Data reduction was carried out with software provided at SRS Daresbury and subsequent analysis was carried out with programs from the ATSAS package ( Konarev et al , 2006 ) . Particle shapes were reconstructed ab initio with the bead modelling program GASBOR ( Svergun et al , 2001 ) , which represents the protein as a chain of dummy residues centred at the C a positions . In addition , the program BUNCH ( Petoukhov and Svergun , 2005 ) was applied using the atomic coordinates of individual domains reported here . Rigid body modelling allows exploration of possible positions and arrange - ments of domains and likely conformations of ﬂexible polypeptide segments consistent with the experimental scattering proﬁle . Electron microscopy Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was prepared and stored as described ( Volkmann et al , 2000 ) . F - actin was used within 2 – 3 weeks of preparation . Talin 2234 – 2541 was used within 1 or 2 days of preparation . The sample was diluted to 0 . 02mg / ml just before the application to glow - discharged 400 - mesh copper grids coated with holey carbon ﬁlm . The ﬁlaments were washed twice with 50mM NaCl , 20mM Pipes , 1mM MgCl 2 at pH 7 . 0 or 7 . 5 . Talin 2234 – 2451 ( 5 m l of 0 . 06mg / ml ) was applied to the grids . Following 30s incubation in a humidiﬁed chamber , a fresh drop of 5 m l protein was added , incubated for another minute , blotted and stained with 2 % aqueous uranyl acetate and air dried or plunge frozen in liquid N 2 - cooled ethane . Images were recorded at a dose of B 10e (cid:4) / A˚ 2 with a Tecnai 12 electron microscope ( FEI Electron Optics , Hillsboro , OR ) at 120keV with a nominal magniﬁcation of 52000 and 1 . 5 m m defocus . A total of 53 images were digitised using a SCAI scanner ( Z / I Imaging Corporation , Englewood , CO ) with pixel size of 0 . 4nm on the sample . Image processing of EM data To generate 3D reconstructions , we ﬁrst applied standard ( Owen and DeRosier , 1993 ) and hybrid approaches ( Egelman , 2000 ; Volkmann et al , 2005 ) for structures with helical symmetry . We selected only ﬁlaments that clearly showed decoration by visual inspection . Control reconstructions of F - actin alone were also calculated . After optimal alignment ( Hanein and DeRosier , 1999 ) , difference maps between the decorated ﬁlaments and the F - actin controls were calculated . None of the difference maps showed statistically signiﬁcant additional density attributable to the attached talin domain . Attempts at sorting into subgroups did not improve the results . Next , we used a reconstruction strategy that does not rely on helical symmetry . Brieﬂy , we selected 374 motifs that showed a clear density attached to the side of the ﬁlament . These were processed using standard single - particle analysis procedures . We built a starting model from F - actin with a talin dimer attached in arbitrary orientation close to the centre of the image . The extra density in the model was necessary to ensure that the extra mass in the experimental data aligned properly . The reconstruction procedure was repeated with a different starting model that converged to a similar reconstruction . An atomic model of F - actin was docked into the density using CoAn ( Volkmann and Hanein , 1999 ) . The SAXS - based dimer models were docked into the remaining density . The Gasbor - based model ( see below ) ﬁts signiﬁcantly better than the BUNCH model . Docking of atomic models into SAXS envelopes and variance analysis The top - scoring nine Gasbor models were converted into electron density ( see Supplementary Materials and methods ) . These densities were optimally aligned using the CoAn algorithm ( Volkmann and Hanein , 1999 ) , ﬁltered to a resolution of 15A˚ , and averaged . The variance distribution was relatively uniform within the envelope . Docking of the atomic models of the ﬁve - helix bundle indicated that neither the orientation of the domain around its long axis nor its direction can be ﬁxed based on the data . The orientation of the long axis itself can be ﬁxed within 7 15 1 . There is also a translational uncertainty of B 6A˚ . Discrepancy maps ( Volkmann and Hanein , 2003 ) were calculated to remove the contribution of the ﬁve - helix bundle from the density and allow docking of the dimerisation domain . Again , the orientation around the long axis is not well determined by the data . The orientation of the long axis is ﬁxed by the symmetry but there is an B 8A˚ uncertainty in translation .
