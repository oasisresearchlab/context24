From this perspective , balancing atypical knowledge with conventional knowledge may be critical to the link between innovativeness and impact . Our analysis of 17 . 9 million papers spanning all scientific fields suggests that science follows a nearly universal pattern : The highest - impact science is primarily grounded in exceptionally conventional combinations of prior work yet simultaneously features an intrusion of unusual combinations . Papers of this type were twice as likely to be highly cited works . Novel combinations of prior work are rare , yet teams are 37 . 7 % more likely than solo authors to insert novel combinations into familiar knowledge domains . S cientific enterprises are increasingly con - cerned that research within narrow bound - aries is unlikely to be the source of the most fruitful ideas ( 1 ) . Models of creativity empha - size that innovation is spurred through original combinations that spark new insights ( 2 – 10 ) . Cur - rent interest in team science and how scientists search for ideas is premised in part on the idea that teams can span scientific specialties , effec - tively combining knowledge that prompts scien - tific breakthroughs ( 11 – 15 ) . Yet the production and consumption of boundary - spanning ideas can also raise well - known challenges ( 16 – 21 ) . If , as Einstein be - lieved ( 21 ) , individual scientists inevitably become narrower in their expertise as the body of sci - entific knowledge expands , then reaching ef - fectively across boundaries may be increasingly challenging ( 4 ) , especially given the difficulty of searching unfamiliar domains ( 17 , 18 ) . More - over , novel ideas can be difficult to absorb ( 19 ) and communicate , leading scientists to inten - tionally display conventionality . In his Principia , Newton presented his laws of gravitation using accepted geometry rather than his newly de - veloped calculus , despite the latter ’ s impor - tance in developing his insights ( 22 ) . Similarly , Darwin devoted the first part of the Origin of Species to conventional , well - accepted knowl - edge about the selective breeding of dogs , cat - tle , and birds . From this viewpoint , the balance between extending science with atypical com - binations of knowledge while maintaining the advantages of conventional domain - level think - ing is critical to the link between innovativeness and impact . However , little is known about the composition of this balance or how scientists can achieve it . In this study , we examined 17 . 9 million re - search articles in the Web of Science ( WOS ) to see howprior work is combined . We present facts that indicate ( i ) the extent to which scientific pa - pers reference novel versus conventional combi - nations of prior work , ( ii ) the relative impact of papers based on the combinations they draw upon , and ( iii ) how ( i ) and ( ii ) are associated with collaboration . We considered pairwise combinations of refer - ences in the bibliography of each paper ( 23 , 24 ) . We counted the frequency of each co - citation pair across all papers published that year in the WOS and compared these observed frequencies to those expected by chance , using randomized citation networks . In the randomized citation networks , all citation links between all papers in the WOS were switched by means of a Monte Carlo algorithm . The switching algorithm pre - serves the total citation counts to and from each paper and the distribution of these citation counts forward and backward in time to ensure that a paper ( or journal ) with n citations in the observed network will have n citations in the randomized network . For both the observed and the randomized paper - to - paper citation networks , we aggregated counts of paper pairs into their respective journal pairs to focus on domain - level combinations ( 24 – 26 ) . In the data , there were over 122 million potential journal pairs created by the 15 , 613 journals indexed in the WOS . 1 Kellogg School of Management , Northwestern University , 2001 Sheridan Road , Evanston , IL 60208 , USA . 2 Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems , Northwestern University , 600 Foster , Evanston , IL 60208 , USA . 3 Datascope Analytics , 180 WestAdamsStreet , Chicago , IL60603 , USA . 4 NationalBureauof EconomicResearch , 1050MassachusettsAvenue , Cambridge , MA 02138 , USA . * Correspondingauthor .

This normalized measure describes whether any given pair appeared novel or conventional . Z scores above zero indicate pairs that appeared more often in the observed data than expected by chance , indicating rela - tively common or “ conventional ” pairings . Z scores below zero indicate pairs that appear less often in the observed WOS than expected by chance , indicating relatively atypical or “ novel ” pair - ings . For example , in the year 1980 , the pairing Tetrahedron and Experientia had a high z score ( 21 . 55 ) indicating a conventional pairing , where - as Tetrahedron paired with Life Sciences had a negative z score ( – 17 . 67 ) , indicating a pair - ing more unusual than chance . The supplemen - tary materials detail these computations , the null model , and an illustrative example ( table S1 and figs . S1 to S3 ) . As a simple validation of the z score mea - sure , we found that journal pairs from the same WOS disciplinary designation had significantly higher z scores than did interdisciplinary journal pairs ( table S3 and fig . S11 ) . At the same time , only a minority ( 40 . 1 % ) of interdisciplinary jour - nal pairs were novel , having z scores below zero in the 1990s . This pattern indicates that observed journal pairings from the same WOS disciplines tend to be conventional , and interdisciplinary WOS journal pairings are less substantially conventional but still not consistently novel . The above method assigns each paper a dis - tribution of journal pair z scores based on the paper ’ s reference list ( Fig . 1A ) . To characterize a paper ’ s tendency to draw together conventional and novel combinations of prior work , we exam - ined two summary statistics . First , to characterize the central tendency of a paper ’ s combinations , we considered the paper ’ s median z score . The me - dian allows us to characterize conventionality in the paper ’ s main mass of combinations . Second , we considered the paper ’ s 10th - percentile z score . The left tail allows us to characterize the paper ’ s more unusual combinations , where novelty may reside . We found that papers typically relied on very high degrees of conventionality . Figure 1B presents the distribution of papers ’ median z scores for the WOS in the indicated decades . Considering that a z score below zero represents a journal pair that occurs less often than expected by chance , the analysis of median z scores sug - gests very high degrees of conventionality . Half of the papers have median z scores exceeding 69 . 0 in the 1980s and 99 . 5 in the 1990s . More - over , papers with a median z score below zero are rare . In the 1980s , only 3 . 54 % of papers had this feature , whereas in the 1990s the percentage fell to 2 . 67 % , indicating a persistent and promi - nent tendency for high conventionality . Focusing on each paper ’ s left tail combina - tions , we found that even among the paper ’ s relatively unusual journal combinations , the ma - jority of papers did not feature atypical journal pairs . Figure 1C shows that 40 . 8 % of the pa - pers in 1980s and 40 . 7 % in the 1990s have a 10th - percentile z score below zero . Overall , by these measures , science typically relies on highly conventional combinations and rarely incorpo - rates journal pairs that are uncommon compared to chance . Analyses in the supplementary mate - rials ( fig . S6 ) show that these empirical regular - ities for the WOS taken as a whole are largely replicated on a field - by - field basis and across time . Our next finding indicates a powerful rela - tionship between combinations of prior work and ensuing impact . Figure 2 presents the probability of a “ hit ” paper , conditional on the combination of its referenced journal pairs . Hit papers are operationalized as those in the upper 5th per - centile of citations received across the whole data set , as measured by total citations through 8 years Fig . 1 . Novelty and conventionality in science . For a sample paper , ( A ) shows the distribution of z scores for that paper ’ s journal pairings . The z score shows how common a journal pairing is as compared to chance . For each paper , we take two summary measures : its median z score , capturing the paper ’ s central tendency in combining prior work , and the 10th - percentile z score , capturing the paper ’ s journal pairings that are relatively unusual . For the population of papers , we then consider these values across all papers in the WOS published in the 1980s or 1990s . ( B ) considers the median z scores and shows that the vast majority of papers displays a high propensity for conventionality ; in the 1980s and 1990s , fewer than 4 % of papers have median z scores below 0 and more than 50 % of papers have median z scores above 64 . ( C ) considers the 10th - percentile z scores , which further suggest a propensity for conventionality ; only 41 % of papers in the 1980s and 1990s have a 10th - percentile z score below 0 . Overall , by these measures , science rarely draws on atypical pairings of prior work . www . sciencemag . org SCIENCE VOL 342 25 OCTOBER 2013 469 REPORTS after publication ( the supplementary materials consider alternative definitions of hit papers ) . The vertical axis shows the probability of a hit paper conditional on a 2 × 2 categorization indicating the paper ’ s ( i ) “ median conventionality ” ( an indi - cator for whether the paper ’ s median z score is in the upper or lower half of all median z scores ) and ( ii ) “ tail novelty ” ( an indicator for whether the paper ’ s 10th - percentile z score is above or below zero ) . Papers with “ high median conventionality ” and “ high tail novelty ” display a hit rate of 9 . 11 out of 100 papers , or nearly twice the background rate of 5 out of 100 papers . All other categories show significantly lower hit rates . Papers featur - ing high median conventionality but low tail novelty displayed hit rates of 5 . 82 out of 100 pa - pers , whereas those featuring low median con - ventionality but high tail novelty display hit rates of 5 . 33 out of 100 papers . Finally , papers low on both dimensions have hit rates of just 2 . 05 out of 100 . Further analyses suggest a universality of these relationships for scientific work across time and fields . We considered the same relationships for different time periods ( fig . S4 ) , for different definitions of high - impact papers ( fig . S5 ) , and for each of 243 fields of science ( fig . S6 and table S2 ) . These analyses confirmed the findings above . Thus , novelty and conventionality are not opposing factors in the production of science ; rather , papers with an injection of novelty into an otherwise exceptionally familiar mass of prior work are unusually likely to have high impact . Collaboration is often claimed to produce more novel combinations of ideas ( 10 – 14 ) , but the extent to which teams incorporate novel combinations across the universe of fields is un - known . Team - authored papers were more likely to show atypical combinations than were single - or pair - authored papers . Figure 3A shows that the distribution of 10th - percentile z scores shifted significantly leftward as the number of authors increased [ Kolmogorov - Smirnov ( K - S ) tests in - dicate solo versus pair P = 0 . 016 , pair versus team P = 0 . 001 , team versus solo P < 0 . 001 ] . Papers written by one , two , or three or more authors showed high tail novelty in 36 . 1 , 39 . 8 , and 49 . 7 % of cases , respectively , indicating that papers with three or more authors showed an increased fre - quency of high tail novelty over the solo - author rate by 37 . 7 % . Fig . 2 . The probability of a “ hit ” paper , conditional on novelty and conventionality . This figure presents the probability of a paper being in the top 5 % of the citation distribution conditional on two dimensions : whether a paper exhibits ( i ) high or low median conventionality and ( ii ) high or low tail novelty , as defined in the text . Papers that combine high median conventionality and high tail novelty are hits in 9 . 11 out of 100 papers , a rate nearly double the background rate of 5 % . Papers that are high on one dimension only ( high median conventionality or high tail novelty but not both ) have hit rates about half as large . Papers with low median conventionality and low tail novelty have hit rates of only 2 . 05 out of 100 papers . The sample includes all papers published in the WOS from 1990 to 2000 . The supplementary materials show similar findings when considering ( i ) all other decades from 1950 to 2000 ; ( ii ) hit papers defined as the top 1 or 10 % by citations ; and ( iii ) analyses controlling for field and other observable differences across papers , hinting at a universality of these relationships for scientific work . The difference in the hit probabilities for each category is statistically significant ( P < 0 . 00001 ) . The percentage of WOS papers in each category are : 6 . 7 % ( green bar ) , 23 % ( gold bar ) , 26 % ( red bar ) , and 44 % ( blue bar ) . Fig . 3 . Authorship structure , novelty , and conventionality . Team - authored papers are more likely to incorporate tail novelty but without sacrificing a central tendency for high conventionality . Papers introduce tail novelty ( a 10th - percentile z score less than 0 ) in 36 . 2 , 39 . 9 , and 49 . 7 % of cases for solo authors , dual authors , and three or more authors , re - spectively ( A ) . K - S tests confirm that the distributions of tail novelty are distinct ( solo versus pair P = 0 . 016 , pair versus team P = 0 . 001 , team versus solo P < 0 . 001 ) . In contrast , each team size shows similar distribu - tions for median conventionality [ ( B ) , K - S tests indicate no statistically significant differences ] . These findings suggest that a distinguishing feature of teamwork , and teams ’ exceptional impact , reflects a tendency to incor - porate novelty . 25 OCTOBER 2013 VOL 342 SCIENCE www . sciencemag . org 470 REPORTS Teams were neither more nor less likely than single authors or pairs of authors to display high median conventionality . Figure 3B indicates no significant statistical difference in the median z - score distributions ( K - S tests indicate solo ver - sus pair P = 0 . 768 , pair versus team P = 0 . 417 , team versus solo P = 0 . 164 ) . Teams thus achieve high tail novelty more often than solo authors . Yet , teams were not simply more novel but rather displayed a propensity to incorporate high tail novelty without giving up a central tendency for high conventionality . In our final analysis , we examined the inter - play between citation , combination , and collabo - ration using regression methods ( Fig . 4 ) . Papers were binned into 11 equally sized categories of median conventionality . A separate regression was run for each category of median conven - tionality and each team size , with field fixed effects . The supplementary materials detail the regression methodology and present additional confirmatory tests ( figs . S7 to S10 ) . There were three primary findings . First , high tail novelty papers had higher impact than low tail novelty papers , an impact advantage that oc - curred at any level of conventionality and regard - less of authorship structure . Second , peak impact occurred in the 85th to 95th percentile of median conventionality , an exceptionally high level . This peak and its position appeared irrespective of tail novelty / no tail novelty or authorship struc - ture . These generic features suggest fundamental underlying rules relating combinations of prior work to the highest - impact science . Finally , Fig . 4 indicates that at virtually all mixes of tail novelty and median conventionality , larger teams were associated with higher impact . Thus , whereas teams incorporated the highest im - pact mixes more frequently ( Fig . 3 ) , teams also tended to obtain higher impact for any particular mix ( Fig . 4 ) . Nonetheless , despite teams ’ advan - tage in citations across virtually all fields of sci - ence ( 12 ) , even teams had low impact at low levels of median conventionality and tail novelty . Our analysis of 17 . 9 million papers across all scientific fields suggests that the highest - impact science draws on primarily highly conventional combinations of prior work , with an intrusion of combinations unlikely to have been joined to - gether before . These patterns suggest that novelty and conventionality are not factors in opposition ; rather , papers that mix high tail novelty with high median conventionality have nearly twice the pro - pensity to be unusually highly cited . These findings have implications for theories about creativity and scientific progress . Combi - nations of existing material are centerpieces in theories of creativity , whether in the arts , the sci - ences , or commercial innovation ( 2 – 4 , 6 – 10 , 16 ) . Across the sciences , the propensity for high - impact work is sharply elevated when combina - tions of prior work are anchored in substantial conventionality , not novelty , while mixing in a left tail of combinations that are rarely seen together . In part , this pattern may reflect advantages to being within the mainstream of a research trajec - tory , where scientists are currently focused , while being distinctive in one ’ s creativity . Combinations of prior work also relate to “ burden of knowl - edge ” theory , which emphasizes the growing knowledge demands on scientists ( 4 , 17 , 21 ) . New articles indexed by the WOS now exceed 1 . 4 mil - lion per year across 251 fields , encouraging spe - cialization and challenging scientists ’ capacity to comprehend new thinking across domains . The finding that teams preserve high conventionality yet introduce tail novelty suggests that teams help meet the challenge of the burden of knowledge by balancing domain - level depth with a capacity for atypical combinations . This methodology considered paper and jour - nal pairings but can be applied at the level of disciplines , papers , or topics within papers , allow - ing the examination of combinations of prior work at different resolutions in future studies of creativity and scientific impact . Beyond science , links between novelty and conventionality in suc - cessful innovation also appear . E - books retain page - flipping graphics to remind the reader of physical books , and blue jeans were designed with a familiar watch pocket to look like conven - tional trousers . From this viewpoint , the balance between extending technology with atypical com - binations of prior ideas while embedding them in conventional knowledge frames may be critical to human progress in many domains . Future research questions also arise from our findings . Science is dynamic , with research areas shifting and new fields arising . Although we find that the regulari - ties relating novelty , conventionality , and impact persist across time and fields , understanding how research trajectories shift and how new fields are born are questions that measures of novelty and conventionmayvaluablyinform . Atroot , our work suggests that creativity in science appears to be a nearly universal phenomenon of two extremes . At one extreme is conventionality and at the other is novelty . Curiously , notable advances in science appear most closely linked not with efforts along one boundary or the other but with efforts that reach toward both frontiers . References and Notes 1 .

David Britt 1 † The radical S - adenosylmethionine ( SAM ) enzyme HydG lyses free L - tyrosine to produce CO and CN − for the assembly of the catalytic H cluster of FeFe hydrogenase . We used electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy to detect and characterize HydG reaction intermediates generated with a set of 2 H , 13 C , and 15 N nuclear spin - labeled tyrosine substrates . We propose a detailed reaction mechanism in which the radical SAM reaction , initiated at an N - terminal 4Fe - 4S cluster , generates a tyrosine radical bound to a C - terminal 4Fe - 4S cluster . Heterolytic cleavage of this tyrosine radical at the C a - C b bond forms a transient 4 - oxidobenzyl ( 4OB (cid:127) ) radical and a dehydroglycine bound to the C - terminal 4Fe - 4S cluster . Electron and proton transfer to this 4OB (cid:127) radical forms p - cresol , with the conversion of this dehydroglycine ligand to Fe - bound CO and CN − , a key intermediate in the assembly of the 2Fe subunit of the H cluster . M icrobial hydrogenase enzymes catalyze the redox interconversion of protons and H 2 by using earth - abundant metals in their catalytic centers , with NiFe , Fe , and FeFe classes known ( 1 ) . The FeFe hydrogenases are adept H 2 producers , with turnover frequen - cies up to 10 , 000 s − 1 ( 2 ) . Their catalytic H cluster ( Fig . 1 ) consists of a conventional 4Fe - 4S cluster linked to a unique 2Fe cluster that has two CN − ligands , three CO ligands , and a dithiolate bridge with a central atom X , the chemical identity of which is ambiguous in current x - ray structures ( 3 , 4 ) . However , a nitrogen assignment to atom X is supported by recent reports of the assembly of active FeFe hydrogenase by incorporation of a synthetic 2Fe subcluster with an azadithiolate bridge into apoenzyme ( 5 , 6 ) . The HydE , HydF , and HydG maturases are Fe - S cluster – containing accessory proteins in - volved in the biological synthesis of the 2Fe component of the H cluster ( 7 ) . HydE and HydG are members of the ever - growing family of radical S - adenosylmethionine ( SAM ) enzymes , character - ized by a CysX 3 CysX 2 Cys motif , where the three cysteine residues coordinate a 4Fe - 4S cluster through ligation of three Fe ions . The fourth Fe of the cluster binds SAMas a N / Ochelate , andSAM is reductively cleaved to produce methionine plus a strongly oxidizing 5 - deoxyadenosyl ( 5 ′ - dA • ) rad - ical ( 8 , 9 ) . A diverse array of reactions is powered by the H - atom abstraction capability of the result - ant 5 ′ - dA • , and current bioinformatics surveys re - veal almost 50 , 000 members of the radical SAM enzyme class ( 10 ) . The focus of this report is the HydGmaturase . This radical SAM enzyme generates CO , CN − , and p - cresol by using free tyrosine as its substrate ( 11 – 14 ) . Although HydG has yet to be crystallo - graphically characterized , biophysical data indi - cate that it has two 4Fe - 4S clusters ( 15 , 16 ) . The SAM – 4Fe - 4S cluster is bound near the N terminus , whereas the second cluster is modeled as coordi - natedtothreecysteineresiduesofaCysX 2 CysX 22 Cys sequence near the C terminus . Sequence homol - ogy with other radical SAM enzymes , such as biotin synthase and the tyrosine lyase ThiH , point to HydG having a triose phosphate isomerase barrel structure , in which eight a helices surround a ring composed of eight parallel b strands that contain a buried active site suitable for small - molecule substrates ( 11 , 17 ) . Like HydG , ThiH also lyses tyrosine , in this case to generate dehydroglycine ( DHG ) as an intermediate in anaerobic thiamine biosynthesis ( 18 , 19 ) . ThiH lacks the second 4Fe - 4S binding domain of HydG . The electron paramagnetic reso - nance ( EPR ) spectrum of the ThiH SAM - [ 4Fe - 4S ] + cluster is altered by SAM binding but unaffected by tyrosine incubation . In a proposed mechanism ( 18 , 19 ) , the initial 5 ′ - dA • abstracts the phenolic H of the tyrosine substrate , forming a neutral tyrosine radical , which is then cleaved at the C a - C b bond . Quantum chemistry calculations favored homolytic cleavage of this bond to form a tran - sient glycyl radical , given its lower energy path - way compared with heterolytic cleavage ( 19 ) . Modeling the differences in reactivity between wild - type HydG and a HydG mutant missing the C - terminal Fe - S cluster ( HydG SxxS ) , which produces some CN − but no CO , led Nicolet and co - workers ( 20 ) topropose the sameglycylradical intermediate in the HydG mechanism , building on the thermodynamic argument for the mecha - nism in ThiH . However , no radical intermediates have been experimentally characterized for either enzyme . Here , we report on the EPR spectroscopy of wild - type Shewanella oneidensis HydG ( HydG WT ) expressed in Escherichia coli . Such expressed HydG , combined with HydE and HydF , can be used for in vitro synthesis of the 2Fe component of the H cluster and concurrent activation of FeFe hydrogenase apoprotein ( 14 , 21 ) .
