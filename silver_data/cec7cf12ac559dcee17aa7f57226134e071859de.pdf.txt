Manymoleculesthatregulateactindynamicsalsoinfluencethemorphologyand / ordensityofdendriticspines . Sincedendriticspinesare neuron - specific subcellular structures , neuron - specific proteins or signals are expected to control spinogenesis . In this report , we char - acterize the distribution and function of neuron - predominant cortactin - binding protein 2 ( CTTNBP2 ) in rodents . An analysis of an Expressed Sequence Tag database revealed three splice variants of mouse CTTNBP2 : short , long , and intron . Immunoblotting indicated that the short form is the dominant CTTNBP2 variant in the brain . CTTNBP2 proteins were highly concentrated at dendritic spines in cultured rat hippocampal neurons as well as in the mouse brain . Knockdown of CTTNBP2 in neurons reduced the density and size of dendritic spines . Consistent with these morphological changes , the frequencies of miniature EPSCs in CTTNBP2 knockdown neurons were lower than those in control neurons . Cortactin acts downstream of CTTNBP2 in spinogenesis , as the defects caused by CTTNBP2 knockdown were rescued by overexpression of cortactin but not expression of a CTTNBP2 mutant protein lacking the cortactin interac - tion . Finally , immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that , unlike cortactin , CTTNBP2 stably resided at dendritic spines even after glutamate stimulation . Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching further suggested that CTTNBP2 modulates the mobility of cortactin in neurons . CTTNBP2 may thus help to immobilize cortactin in dendritic spines and control the density of dendritic spines . Introduction Dendritic spines , the major locations of excitatory synapses in mammalian brains ( Harris and Stevens , 1989 ) , are actin - rich structures ( Fischer et al . , 2000 ) . Neuronal activity controls actin cytoskeleton dynamics and thus modulates dendritic spine mor - phology and remodeling ( Matus , 2000 ; Pontrello and Ethell , 2009 ) . Cortactin , an actin - binding protein ( Wu and Parsons , 1993 ) , promotes branching and stabilization of actin filaments ( for review , see Ammer and Weed , 2008 ; Ren et al . , 2009 ) and is highly enriched in the lamellipodia of motile cells ( Wu and Par - sons , 1993 ) and in the dendritic spines of neurons ( Hering and Sheng , 2003 ) . Knockdown of endogenous cortactin reduces the spine density in cultured hippocampal neurons ( Hering and Sheng , 2003 ) , indicating a critical role for cortactin in spinogen - esis . Moreover , NMDA receptor ( NMDAR ) activation triggers the redistribution of cortactin from dendritic spines to the den - dritic shaft ( Hering and Sheng , 2003 ) , suggesting that cortactin participates in neuronal activity - dependent remodeling of den - dritic spines . Cortactin interacts with filamentous actin ( F - actin ) via cen - tral actin - binding repeats ( Weed et al . , 2000 ) and binds to the Arp2 / 3 complex with its N - terminal acidic domain ( Weed et al . , 2000 ; Uruno et al . , 2001 ; Weaver et al . , 2001 ) . These interactions stabilize and promote the branching of actin filaments ( Uruno et al . , 2001 ; Weaver et al . , 2001 ) . Cortactin thus contributes to the morphological maintenance of dendritic spines ( Hering and Sheng , 2003 ) . We wondered whether the activity of cortactin in the regulation of dendritic spinogenesis , a neuron - specific event , is controlled by a neuron - specific signal or interacting protein . Several proteins containing a proline - rich sequence that interacts with the C - terminal Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain of cortactin can direct cortactin’s participation in various cellular events ( for review , see Cosen - Binker and Kapus , 2006 ; Ammer and Weed , 2008 ) . For instance , the SH3 domain of cortactin interacts with postsynaptic density cortactin - binding protein 1 ( CortBP1 ) ( Du et al . , 1998 ) , also known as Shank ( Naisbitt et al . , 1999 ) . This interaction bridges F - actin , the postsynaptic guanylate kinase - associated protein – PSD - 95 – NMDAR complex ( Naisbitt et al . , 1999 ) , and the Homer – mGluR complex ( Tu et al . , 1999 ) . In ad - dition , cortactin - binding protein 2 ( CTTNBP2 ) , also known as CortBP2 ( Cheung et al . , 2001 ) or CBP90 ( Ohoka and Takai , 1998 ) , was found to interact with the SH3 domain of cortactin ReceivedAug . 29 , 2011 ; revisedNov . 26 , 2011 ; acceptedDec . 2 , 2011 .

DOI : 10 . 1523 / JNEUROSCI . 4405 - 11 . 2012 Copyright©2012theauthors 0270 - 6474 / 12 / 321043 - 13 $ 15 . 00 / 0 TheJournalofNeuroscience , January18 , 2012 • 32 ( 3 ) : 1043 – 1055 • 1043 ( Ohoka and Takai , 1998 ) . Although CTTNBP2 is exclusively ex - pressed in the brain ( Ohoka and Takai , 1998 ) , its function in neurons and in the regulation of cortactin activity is still com - pletely unknown . In the present study , we hypothesize that CTTNBP2 regulates neuron - specific cortactin functions , such as dendritic spine for - mation . The interaction between cortactin and CTTNBP2 in neurons was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and immuno - staining . Through a combination of RNAi knockdown , immu - nostaining , and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) , our investigation suggests that CTTNBP2 regulates the mobility of cortactin and thus controls the formation and main - tenance of dendritic spines . Materials and Methods Antibodiesandreagents . Thefollowingantibodieswereusedinthisstudy : rabbit polyclonal cortactin ( H - 191 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) ; mouse monoclonal PSD - 95 ( K28 / 43 ; Millipore ) ; mouse monoclonal Myc - tag ( 9B11 ; Cell Signaling Technology ) ; rabbit polyclonal green fluorescent protein ( GFP ; A - 6455 , Invitrogen ) ; chicken polyclonal GFP ( ab13970 ; Abcam ) ; mouse vesicular GABA transporter ( VGAT ; 131 011 , Synaptic Systems ) ; and mouse monoclonal (cid:1) - tubulin ( B - 5 - 1 - 2 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) . CTTNBP2 polyclonal antibody was generated by immunizing rabbits withglutathione S - transferase ( GST ) - CTTNBP2 ( aminoacids498 – 625 ) recombinant protein . After passage through a GST - coupled affinity col - umn , specific antibody was purified with a GST - CTTNBP2 ( amino acids 498 – 625 ) - conjugated column . Alexa Fluor 546 - conjugated phalloidin was purchased from Invitrogen . Tetrodotoxin and bicuculline were pur - chased from Tocris Bioscience . DNA constructs . pGW1 - CMV - Myc - cortactin and pGW1 - CMV - GFP - cortactin ( Hering and Sheng , 2003 ) were gifts from Dr . Morgan Sheng at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Cambridge , MA ( current affiliation : Genentech , South San Francisco , CA ) . To construct the CTTNBP2 short - form expression plas - mid , the 5 (cid:1) ( 1 – 1413 bp ) and 3 (cid:1) ( 1393 – 1893 bp ) regions of the coding sequence ( CDS ) were amplified by PCR from RIKEN 4732477G22 and IMAGE 6833056 , respectively . The resulting overlapped DNA fragments weremixedforanassemblyPCRinwhichtheyprimedoneachotherandassembledintotheCTTNBP2short - form full - length CDS . Following PCRwithprimerscarryingadditionalKpnIandBglIIrestrictionsites , the full - length CDS was cloned into the vector pGW1 – CMV with or without a Myc tag . For long - form CTTNBP2 , the 3 (cid:1) coding sequences were amplified from mouse genomic DNA ( 1393 – 2038 bp ) and RIKEN 6430526E05 ( 2020 – 4947 bp ) and were assembled by PCR . For the intron form CTT - NBP2 , the 3 (cid:1) coding sequences ( 1393 – 2133 bp ) were amplified from mousegenomicDNA . TogeneratetheCTTNBP2long - formandintron - form expression constructs , the resulting 3 (cid:1) coding sequences were indi - vidually cloned into the short - form expression vector using NheI and EcoRI to replace the 3 (cid:1) segment of the short - form CDS . For miRNA knockdown , the linearized vector pcDNA6 . 2 – GW / EmGFP - miR was purchased from Invitrogen . The nucleotide sequence ofbasepairs1362 – 1382oftheCTTNBP2CDSwasthenusedtoconstruct pcDNA6 . 2 - GW / EmGFP - miR - BP2 ( BP2 - miR ) according to the manu - facturer’s instructions . Plasmid cDNA6 . 2 - GW / EmGFP - neg control ( Ctrl - miR ) , which expresses a miRNA that was predicted to not target any gene in mammalian genomes , was used as the negative control in the knockdown experiments . Both miR - BP2 and Ctrl - miR coexpress EmGFP , which was used to outline cell morphology . To obtain miRNA vectors coexpressing mCherry , the miRNA cassettes in BP2 - miR and Ctrl - miR were individually amplified and cloned into the pGW1 – CMV – mCherry vector using EcoRI . Consequently , the miRNA cassettes were integrated into the 3 (cid:1) untranslated region of the mCherry transcripts . The original pRSETB – mCherry construct was kindly provided by Pro - fesspr Roger Tsien at the University of California , San Diego , CA . The mCherrycodingregionwasPCRamplifiedandsubclonedintothevectorGW1 – CMV . For generating the CTTNBP2 constructs PA1 ( P540A / P543A ) , PA2 ( P599A / P602A ) , and a silent mutant resistant to the CTTNBP2 miRNA , site - directed mutagenesis was performed with the following oligonucleo - tides : PA1 , 5 (cid:1) - CAGAGGAAATCCT G CTCCTATC G CTCCCAAAAAGC CAG - 3 (cid:1) ; PA2 , 5 (cid:1) - CTAAGTCGTCCTCC G CTCAGCTG G CACCAAAACC GTCC - 3 (cid:1) ; silent mutant , 5 (cid:1) - GGGCAATGCAAATGA T CC T GACCA A A ATGGAAATAACACT - 3 (cid:1) . The bases in italics indicate the mutated sites . Reverse transcription - PCR . Total RNA was isolated from embryonic day 14 . 5 mouse brain using Trizol ( Invitrogen ) , followed by treatment with DNase I ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Reverse transcription - PCR ( RT - PCR ) was performed with the One - Step RT - PCR Kit ( Genemark ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . To discriminate between the various splicing forms of CTTNBP2 ( see Fig . 1 A ) , three oligonucleotide primers weredesigned : A , 5 (cid:1) - CCTCCCTCTACTTTGCCACA - 3 (cid:1) ; B , 5 (cid:1) - GCCATCTTCG CAGGAGTAAT - 3 (cid:1) ; C , 5 (cid:1) - AAGAAATGAGGAAGTGGGTGAA - 3 (cid:1) . Animals . All animal experiments were performed with the approval of the Academia Sinica Institutional Animal Care and Utilization Commit - tee . For primary culture , pregnant rats were killed by CO 2 inhalation ; E18 – E19 fetal pups were then isolated and killed by decapitation . To prepare brain extracts for biochemical study , adult rats of either sex were killedbydecapitationwithaguillotine . Forimmunohistochemistry , 2 - to 3 - month - old mice of either sex were first anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with a mixture of ketamine ( 8 . 7 mg / 100 g of body weight ) and xylazine ( 1 . 3 mg / 100 g of body weight ) and intracardiacally perfused with (cid:2) 50mlofPBScontainingheparin ( 10U / ml ) followedby (cid:2) 50mlof 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS to fix brain tissue . After dissection from skulls , brains were post - fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde overnight at 4°C for slicing at a later time . Immunoprecipitation . To obtain a soluble synaptosome fraction , the brains of 2 - to 4 - month - old rats of either sex were homogenized in lysis buffer ( 10m M Tris , pH7 . 4 , 320m M sucrose , 2m M dithiothreitol , 2 (cid:2) g / ml leupeptin , 2 (cid:2) g / ml pepstatin - A , 2 (cid:2) g / ml aprotinin , 1 m M tosylphenyla - lanylchloromethane , and 2 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ) and cen - trifuged at 800 (cid:3) g for 10 min at 4°C . The supernatant was centrifuged at 9200 (cid:3) g for 15 min to collect the synaptosomal fraction ( P2 ) , which was then resuspended and incubated in 20 m M Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 5 m M ethylene - diaminetetraacetic acid , 200 m M NaCl , and 1 % Triton X - 100 for 1 h at 4°C . After centrifugation at 35 , 000 (cid:3) g for 40 min , the supernatant was collected for further experiments . For immunoprecipitation , the soluble synaptosome fraction was diluted fivefold in 20 m M Tris buffer and in - cubated with antibody preadsorbed Sepharose resin at 4°C overnight . The resin was washed three times with 20 m M Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 40 m M NaCl , and 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 , and immunoblotted . Primary rat hippocampal neuron cultures and immunofluorescence . At embryonic day 18 – 19 , rat hippocampal neurons were dissociated by trypsinization , resuspended in growth medium ( 50 % Neurobasal Me - dium and 50 % DMEM supplemented with 2 % B27 supplement , 0 . 5 m M glutamine , and 12 . 5 (cid:2) M glutamate ) , and plated in 12 - well culture plates containing glass coverslips coated with poly - L - lysine ( 1 mg / ml ) at a den - sity of 200 , 000 neurons per well . Transfection was performed at 12 DIV using calcium phosphate precipitation . For immunofluorescence , cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde and 4 % sucrose in PBS , followed by permeabilization with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 in PBS at 18 DIV . To ex - ploretheroleofCTTNBP2inthemaintenanceofdendriticspines , trans - fection was performed at 20 DIV and immunostaining was performed at 26 DIV . After blocking with 10 % bovine serum albumin , cells were in - cubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 3 % bovine serum albumin at 4°C overnight . Following PBS washes , the cells were incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 , 555 , and / or 647 ( Invitrogen ) for 2 h . DNA was counterstained with 4 (cid:1) , 6 (cid:1) - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole dihydrochloride ( DAPI ) . Vectashield mounting medium ( H - 1000 ; Vector Laboratories ) was used to mount the samples for imaging . Images were acquired using a confocal micro - scope ( LSM510 - Meta or LSM700 ; Carl Zeiss ) equipped with a 63 (cid:3) / NA 1 . 4 oil ( Plan - Apochromat ; Carl Zeiss ) objective lens and LSM 3 . 2 or Zen 2009 ( Carl Zeiss ) acquisition and analysis software . All fixed cells were imaged at 20 – 22°C . For publication , the images were processed with Photoshop ( Adobe ) with minimal adjustment of brightness or contrast applied to the whole images .

Density and size were manuallyquantitatedalong20 (cid:2) mofdendritestarting20 (cid:2) mawayfrom the soma . Some experiments were repeated blind to minimize the effect of bias . Statistical analysis of spine density was performed with unpaired Student’s t tests ( see Fig . 4 D ) or with one - way ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc test ( see Fig . 5 C ) using GraphPad Prism 5 . 0 ( GraphPad Software ) . Spine width and length were analyzed with the Kolmogorov – Smirnov test using SPSS 10 . 0 ( SPSS ) . Immunohistochemistry . The 50 - (cid:2) m - thick adult mouse brain sections were collected with a vibratome and incubated with CTTNBP2 antibody at 1 (cid:2) g / ml in PBS containing 3 % horse serum , 2 % bovine serum albu - min , and 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 at 4°C for 2 d . After washing , the brain sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 - conjugated secondary an - tibody , Alexa Fluor 546 - conjugated phalloidin , and DAPI at room tem - perature for 2 h . Images were acquired as described above . Time - lapse recording and FRAP . Time - lapse recording was performed using a confocal microscope ( LSM700 ; Carl Zeiss ) with a 63 (cid:3) / 1 . 4 oil objective ( Plan - Apochromat ; Carl Zeiss ) at 37°C supplied with 5 % CO 2 . One day after transfection , COS cells were trypsinized and replated on poly - L - lysine ( 0 . 1 mg / ml ) - coated glass coverslips , followed by a 4 h in - cubation at 37°C . Before recording , culture medium was replaced with prewarmed HBSS ( Invitrogen ) . The GFP and mCherry signals were ac - quired every 5 s for 5 – 10 min . For FRAP , hippocampal neurons grown on poly - L - lysine ( 1 mg / ml ) - coated glass coverslips were transfected at 12 DIV and recorded at 18 DIV . During FRAP , the image series was captured before and immedi - ately after photobleaching with 0 . 5 s intervals and a scan speed of (cid:4) 0 . 2 s / scan . Spines of interest were photobleached 10 times with a 488 nm laser at 100 % output . ImageJ was used to measure fluorescence intensity in the image series . For each image , a region without transfected cells was measured as background , and its intensity was subtracted from the in - tensity of the region of interest . These raw data were divided by the intensity measured at unbleached dendrites to correct for fluorescence loss during image acquisition . Finally , all intensity data were normalized to the average fluorescence intensity of 10 scans acquired just before bleaching . GraphPad Prism was used for curve fitting with the following one - phase exponential equation : y (cid:5) a ( 1 (cid:6) exp ( (cid:6) bx ) ) . Electrophysiology . Cultured rat hippocampal neurons were transfected at 12 DIV , and whole - cell patch - clamps were performed at 18 DIV to recordminiatureEPSCs ( mEPSCs ) . Neuronswereincubatedinextracel - lular solution containing 145 m M NaCl , 3 m M KCl , 10 m M HEPES , 3 m M CaCl 2 , 2 m M MgCl 2 , 8 m M glucose , 0 . 001 m M tetrodotoxin , and 0 . 02 m M bicuculline . The intracellular solution contained 136 . 5 m M K - gluconate , 9 m M NaCl , 17 . 5 m M KCl , 10 m M HEPES , 0 . 2 m M ethylene glycol tet - raacetic acid , 4 m M Mg - ATP , and 0 . 3 m M Na - ATP . Neurons were voltage - clamped at (cid:6) 70 mV , and mEPSCs were recorded with the Axon Axopatch 200B amplifier ( Molecular Devices ) and filtered at 1 kHz . The Clampfit 9 software ( Molecular Devices ) was used to detect mEPSCs from the raw data with an amplitude threshold of 4 . 5 pA . The mEPSC recording was performed blind at the Electrophysiology and Calcium ImagingCoreFacility , NeuroscienceProgramandInstituteofMolecular Biology , AcademiaSinica . Statisticalanalysesofamplitudeandfrequency were then performed with unpaired Student’s t tests using GraphPad Prism . Results The CTTNBP2 short form is the major gene transcript in the brain Rat CTTNBP2 was originally identified as a protein product smaller than 90 kDa from a pulldown assay with a GST - cortactin fusion protein ( Ohoka and Takai , 1998 ) . Later , hu - man CTTNBP2 was predicted to encode a 1663 aa product ( Cheung et al . , 2001 ) . Through analysis of an Expressed Se - quence Tag database , we identified three transcripts encoded by CTTNBP2 : short , long , and intron forms ( Table 1 ) . This variation is due to alternative splicing between exon 4 and exon 5 of CTTNBP2 ( Fig . 1 A ) . Two RNA splice donor sites are present at the end of exon 4 of CTTNBP2 . When the first splice site is used , the transcript encodes the short form of CTTNBP2 . When the second splice site is chosen , the long protein is produced . Retention of intron 4 causes the production of the intron form ; the polypeptide chain terminates early at the alternative stop codon in intron 4 . Thus , the C - terminal amino acid sequences of these three forms are variant ( Fig . 1 B ) . To investigate expression of these three forms in neurons , we first performed RT - PCR using RNA extracted from mouse brain , which suggested that the short - form transcripts were the pre - dominant products of CTTNBP2 in the mouse brain ( Fig . 1 C ) . To confirm this observation , we generated CTTNBP2 - specific antibodies to analyze the protein products of CTTNBP2 ( Fig . 1 D ) ; only the fragment containing the proline - rich domain suc - cessfully generated CTTNBP2 - specific antibodies ( Fig . 1 D ) . Compared with cell extracts prepared from COS cells transfected with the short , long , and intron forms individually , the short form appeared to be the dominant protein product of CTTNBP2 in the brain ( Fig . 1 E ) . We therefore only included the short form in our subsequent investigations . CTTNBP2 interacts with cortactin in COS cells and in neurons A previous study demonstrated the interaction between cor - tactin and CTTNBP2 by a fusion protein pulldown assay ( Ohoka and Takai , 1998 ) . To confirm the interaction of cor - tactin and CTTNBP2 in cells , we transfected GFP - cortactin and mCherry - CTTNBP2 into COS cells ; 1 d after transfection , cells were replated and analyzed by time - lapse recording (cid:4) 4 h after replating . Under these conditions , high cell mobility facil - itates the observation of cytoskeleton dynamics . The live imaging clearly showed the colocalization and comigration of cortactin and CTTNBP2 at the cell cortex and intracellular puncta of COS cells ( Fig . 2 A , B ) . Some CTTNBP2 / cortactin puncta associated with intracellular vesicles [ Fig . 2 A ( inset ) , B ] . Additionally , cor - tactin antibodies precipitated cortactin as well as CTTNBP2 from rat brain extracts ( Fig . 2 C ) , further supporting the interaction of CTTNBP2 and cortactin in neurons . Cortactin interacts with F - actin via its central repeat do - mains and binds to CTTNBP2 through its C - terminal SH3 domain . CTTNBP2 therefore likely associates with F - actin through the interaction with cortactin . To test this possibility , COS cells were transfected with Myc - tagged CTTNBP2 and immunostained 1 d after transfection using an anti - Myc anti - body and phalloidin . In fixed cells , F - actin and CTTNBP2 were colocalized at the cell cortex ( Fig . 2 D , arrowheads ) , re - flecting the association of CTTNBP2 with the cortactin - F - actin cytoskeletons .

Neurosci . , January18 , 2012 • 32 ( 3 ) : 1043 – 1055 • 1045 CTTNBP2 is highly concentrated at synapses in cultured neurons and brains Since cortactin is concentrated at the dendritic spines and regu - lates spine morphology , we wondered whether CTTNBP2 also localized to dendritic spines in neurons . Myc - tagged CTTNBP2 and GFP were coexpressed in neurons , and immunostaining in - dicated that Myc - tagged CTTNBP2 was highly concentrated at dendritic spines ( Fig . 3 A ) . CTTNBP2 - specific antibody was then used to examine the distribution of endogenous CTTNBP2 . In Myc - tagged CTTNBP2 - transfected COS cells , the immuno - reactivities of the CTTNBP2 antibody colocalized well with Myc - tag immunoreactivities ( Fig . 3 B ) , supporting the specificity of our CTTNBP2 antibody . Triple staining with anti - CTTNBP2 , postsynaptic marker PSD - 95 antibody , and phalloidin in cul - tured hippocampal neurons at 23 DIV demonstrated that the CTTNBP2immunoreactivitiescolocalizedverywellwiththoseofPSD - 95 and F - actin in mature cultured neurons ( Fig . 3 C ) . In adult mouse brains , CTTNBP2 immunoreactivities were also co - localized with F - actin ( Fig . 3 D ) , and higher magnification re - vealed the punctate patterns of CTTNBP2 and F - actin , which colocalized along dendrites ( Fig . 3 E ) . The CTTNBP2 / F - actin double - positive puncta did not colocalize with the inhibitory synapse marker VGAT ( Fig . 3 E , enlarged images ) , suggesting that the CTTNBP2 / F - actin puncta are not the location of inhibitory synapses . In addition to dendritic spines , CTTNBP2 antibody also accumulated in a punctate signal in the soma ; however , these somatic CTTNBP2 puncta were not colocalized with F - actin ( Fig . 3 E ) . Together , these immunofluorescence experiments identified the synaptic distribution of CTTNBP2 in cultured neurons and mouse brains and suggested an association of CTTNBP2 with actin cytoskeletons . Knockdown of CTTNBP2 reduces the density and size of dendritic spines To explore the role of CTTNBP2 in dendritic spine morphogenesis , we generated an artificial CTTNBP2 miRNA construct ( BP2 - miR ) to knock down CTTNBP2 expression in cells . Nonsilencing Ctrl - miR predicted not to target any gene in mammalian genomes was used as a negative control . BP2 - miR reduced the expression of cotransfected Myc - tagged CTTNBP2 in COS cells ( Fig . 4 A ) . We next examined the effect of BP2 - miR in cultured hippocampal neu - rons ; sinceourmiRNAconstructscoexpressedEmGFP , theEmGFP signals labeled transfected neurons and outlined cell morphology . Immunostaining with GFP and CTTNBP2 antibodies demon - strated that the CTTNBP2 immunoreactivities were lower in BP2 - miR - transfected neurons than in Ctrl - miR - transfected neurons or neighboring untransfected neurons ( Fig . 4 B ) . High - magnification images revealed that BP2 - miR expression impaired dendritic spine morphology ( Fig . 4 C ) . The spine density of CTTNBP2 - knockdown neurons ( 5 . 1 (cid:7) 0 . 3 spines / 10 (cid:2) m ) was significantly lower than that Figure1 . ExpressionofCTTNBP2inthebrain .

The width of the spine heads was also reduced in CTTNBP2 - knock - down neurons ( mean widths : BP2 - miR , 0 . 55 (cid:2) m ; Ctrl - miR , 0 . 68 (cid:2) m ) . However , the lengths of the dendritic spines were not affected by CTTBP2 knockdown ( Fig . 4 D ) . The same conclusions were also obtained in blind experiments ( data not shown ) . To corroborate these morphological changes in the dendritic spines , we conducted blind experiments to further measure the frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs in BP2 - miR - transfected neurons . Consistent with the change in dendritic spine density , the mEPSC frequency of BP2 - miR - transfected neurons was lower than that of control neurons ( Fig . 4 E , F ) ; however , the amplitude of the mEPSC did not differ significantly between CTTNBP2 knock - down neurons and control neurons ( Fig . 4 E , G ) . Knockdown of CTTNBP2 in neurons thus impairs the density and morphology of dendritic spines and the electrophys - iological response of neurons .

A previous study had identi - fiedtheproline - richdomainofCTTNBP2asa domainthatinteractedwiththecortactinSH3domain ( OhokaandTakai , 1998 ) . Wefurther identified two candidate SH3 - binding do - mains in CTTNBP2 : amino acids 538 – 547 ( - NPPPIPPKKP - ) and amino acids 597 - 606 ( - SSPQLPPKPS - ) . Two proline - to - alanine mutations were introduced into each stretch to identify the region critical for cortactin binding . These mutants were designated PA1 for the P540A / P543A double mutant and PA2 for the P599A / P602A double mutant . Compared with wild - type CTTNBP2 , both the PA1 and PA2 mutations reduced the interaction between cortactin and CTTNBP2 in COS cells ; the PA1 mutation almost completely abolished the interaction ( Fig . 5 A ) . Since the PA1 mutation more strongly interfered with the interaction between cor - tactin and CTTNBP2 , we used this mutant toexaminetheroleoftheinteractionofcor - tactinandCTTNBP2indendriticspinogen - esis . In CTTNBP2 knock - down neurons , expression of the silent mutant resistant to BP2 - miR ( BP2 - resc ) rescued the effect of BP2 - miR on spine density ( Fig . 5 B , C ) . However , the PA1 mutant also resistant to BP2 - miR ( BP2 - PA1 - resc ) didnotrescuethe spine density phenotype of the CTTNBP2 knockdown ( Fig . 5 B , C ) , suggesting that the interaction with cortactin is required for CTTNBP2 to control spine density . Consis - tent with this possibility , cortactin overex - pression also rescued the phenotype of the CTTNBP2 knockdown ( Fig . 5 B , C ) . To - gether , these observations suggest that cor - tactin functions downstream of CTTNBP2 to regulate dendritic spine density . Dendriticspinelengthwasunaffectedby treatment with BP2 - resc , BP2 - PA1 - resc , or cortactin ( Fig . 5 D , right ) , consistent with our conclusion that CTTNBP2 does not regulate spine length . For the widths of the spine heads , cortactin overexpression rescued the spine - head phenotype of the CTTNBP2 knockdown ( Fig . 5 B , D ) . Unexpectedly , although the BP2 - PA1 - resc mutant did not rescue the effect of BP2 - miR on spine density ( Fig . 5 C ) , it restored the spine - head phenotype of the CTTNBP2 knock - down ( Fig . 5 B , D ) , suggesting that there are two pathways down - streamofCTTNBP2tocontrolthesizeofspineheads , onecortactin dependent , the other cortactin independent . Activation of either pathway is sufficient to maintain the size of spine heads . Alternatively , since the effect of BP2 - miR on the spine widths is weaker than that on the spine density , it is also possible that the spine width phenotype is easier to rescue with BP2 - PA1 - resc , although the interaction between cortactinandBP2 - PA1 - rescisreducedtoaverylowlevel . Cortactin , but not CTTNBP2 , redistributes into the dendritic shaft after glutamate treatment A previous study showed that glutamate treatment induces the redistribution of cortactin and actin from dendritic spines to the dendritic shaft ( Hering and Sheng , 2003 ) , which may contribute to the regulation of activity - dependent remodeling of dendritic spines . Since our data suggest that cortactin acts downstream of CTTNBP2 to control spine density , we investigated whether CTTNBP2 also redistributed to the dendritic shaft after gluta - mate stimulation . Two treatments were used to stimulate cul - tured hippocampal neurons at (cid:4) 21 – 24 DIV : 50 (cid:2) M glutamate treatment for 2 min ( plus 8 min recovery ) or 15 min . Similar to the previous report ( Hering and Sheng , 2003 ) , F - actin and cortactin were redistributed to the dendrites after glutamate treatment in both conditions ( Fig . 6 A , B , data not shown for the distribution of cortactin after 15 min glutamate treatment ) . In con - trast , CTTNBP2 remained at the dendritic spines after glutamate stimulation ( Fig . 6 A , B ) . As previously ( Hering and Sheng , 2003 ) , glutamate - induced F - actin and cortactin redistribution relied on NMDARbutnotAMPAR , sincetheeffectofNMDAonF - actinand cortactin is similar to that of glutamate ( Fig . 6 , compare C , A ) .

Together , these observations suggest that , unlike cortactin and F - actin , the synaptic distribution of CTTNBP2 does not shift to the dendritic shaft in response to neuronal activation . CTTNBP2 regulates the mobility of cortactin in dendritic spines We observed that CTTNBP2 stably resides at dendritic spines and that CTTNBP2 acts upstream of cortactin to regulate spine den - sity and morphology . FRAP was therefore used to test whether CTTNBP2 regulated the mobility of cortactin at dendritic spines . To label miRNA expression in GFP - cortactin - positive neurons , the miRNA cassettes in the miRNA constructs were cloned into the mCherry expression vector to generate BP2 - miR ( Cherry ) and Ctrl - miR ( Cherry ) . At 12 DIV , GFP - cortactin was cotrans - fected with BP2 - miR ( Cherry ) and Ctrl - miR ( Cherry ) into cul - tured hippocampal neurons ; only neurons double labeled with GFP and mCherry ( Fig . 7 A ) were subjected to FRAP analysis at 18 DIV . After bleaching , time - lapse recording was continued to monitor the recovery of GFP - cortactin ( Fig . 7 B ) . The recovery rate of GFP - cortactin at the dendritic spines of CTTNBP2 - knockdown neurons was faster than that in neurons transfected with Ctrl - miR ( Cherry ) ( Fig . 7 C ) , with recovery half - times of 2 . 18 and 4 . 22 s , respectively , suggesting that cortactin mobility is reg - ulated by CTTNBP2 . Moreover , recovered GFP - cortactin fluo - rescence reached prebleaching levels in CTTNBP2 - knock - down neurons ( Fig . 7 C ) . By contrast , the plateau of recovered GFP - cortactin fluorescence in control neurons maximized at 85 % of the prephotobleaching levels ( Fig . 7 C ) , suggesting that (cid:4) 15 % of thecortactinstablyresidedindendriticspinesduetothepresenceofCTTNBP2 , likely through the interaction of CTTNBP2 and cortactin . To ensure that the mobility of GFP fluorescence was con - trolled by cortactin , rather than by GFP itself , we also performed FRAP with cultured hippocampal neurons transfected with GFP . The recovery rate of GFP alone was much faster than that of GFP - cortactin in control and CTTNBP2 knock - down neurons ( Fig . 7 C ) , supporting the relevance of the GFP - cortactin FRAP assay . Knockdown of CTTNBP2 reduces the distribution of cortactin at dendritic spines To further confirm the role of CTTNBP2 in controlling the syn - aptic distribution of cortactin , we performed immunostaining of endogenous cortactin in CTTNBP2 knock - down neurons and control neurons . Consistent with a previous study ( Hering and Sheng , 2003 ) , cortactin was highly enriched at dendritic spines in control neurons . In CTTNBP2 knock - down neurons , the density and size of the dendritic spines was reduced ( Fig . 8 A ) , with Figure6 . CTTNBP2stablyresidesatdendriticspinesafterglutamatestimulation .

A line scan starting from the tip of the den - driticspineandendingontheothersideofthedendriticshaftwasthenperformedtoquantifytheintensityofcortactinatspinesanddendrites . Our quantitative analysis revealed a reduction in the cortactin protein levels at the dendritic spines in CTTNBP2 knock - down neurons ( Fig . 8 B ) . We noticed that the global inten - sity of cortactin in CTTNBP2 knock - down neurons seemed lower than that in control neurons . It is possible that knockdown ofCTTNBP2influencesthelevelsofcortactinproteininneurons . We then compared the ratio of the cortactin protein level at the spines to that at the dendrites . In control neurons , the ratio was 3 . 8 ( the peak of cortactin intensity / the mean of cortactin intensity from a distance of 2 . 5 – 3 . 5 (cid:2) m (cid:5) 149 . 4 / 39 . 6 ) . When CTTNBP2 was knocked down , the ratio dropped to 2 . 4 ( 67 . 9 / 28 . 2 ) . Therefore , the global reduction in cortactin protein lev - els is unlikely to be the main cause of the reduction in cortactin enrichment at the spines . Together , these data support the notion that CTTNBP2 regulates the dendritic spine distribu - tion of cortactin in neurons . Discussion Here we have characterized the distribution and function of CTTNBP2 in neurons . CTTNBP2 proteins , which are specifically expressed in neurons ( Ohoka and Takai , 1998 ) , are highly con - centrated at the dendritic spines of cultured hippocampal neu - rons and brains . Knockdown of CTTNBP2 reduced the density and size of dendritic spines , supporting a role for CTTNBP2 in dendritic spine formation and maintenance . Our observations also suggest that CTTNBP2 interacts with and immobilizes cor - tactin at dendritic spines and functions upstream of cortactin to control dendritic spine density . Through interactions with F - actin and the Arp2 / 3 com - plex , cortactin is believed to facilitate actin polymerization and branching ( Weaver et al . , 2001 ) . It thus controls enlarge - ment of the dendritic spines and maintenance of dendritic spine morphology ( Hering and Sheng , 2003 ) . When neurons were treated with glutamate , cortactin dispersed to the den - dritic shafts . However , CTTNBP2 stably resided in dendritic spines and controlled the mobility of cortactin . Shank , an - other protein that interacts with the SH3 domain of cortactin , also remains at the postsynaptic density after glutamate treat - ment ( Naisbitt et al . , 1999 ; Tao - Cheng et al . , 2010 ) . Although it is unclear whether Shank also regulates the mobility of cor - tactin in dendritic spines , it is possible that multiple binding partners participate in this regulation . Through these interactions with binding partners , cortactin targets various upstream protein complexes and receives signals to influence dendritic spine formation . Since NMDAR activation triggers translocation of cortactin from the dendritic spines to the dendritic shaft , unknown signals downstream of NMDAR may regulate the interaction of cortactin and CTTNBP2 .

A previous proteomics study indicated that CTTNBP2 N terminus - like ( CTTNBP2NL ) , a molecule sharing 54 % amino acid similarity with CTTNBP2 , associates with the serine / threo - nine protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ) protein complex in HEK293 cells ( Goudreault et al . , 2009 ) . Since the PP2A complex contains striatins ( Goudreault et al . , 2009 ) , which are highly en - riched at dendritic spines ( Gaillard et al . , 2006 ) , it seems possible that CTTNBP2 associates with the PP2A complex in neurons . Since cortactin is regulated by phosphorylation , if CTTNBP2 in - teracts with the PP2A complex , it is likely that PP2A dephospho - rylates cortactin or CTTNBP2 and thus modulates the activity of cortactin and CTTNBP2 in controlling F - actin polym - erization and actin branching ( Fig . 9 A ) . Actin polymerization and branching have been suggested to play an essential role in the enlargement of dendritic spines ( for review , see Ethell and Pasquale , 2005 ; Tada and Sheng , 2006 ) . Rac1 , a small GT - Pase protein , is known to promote actin branching and polymerization through the pathway containing the insulin receptor substrate p53 ( IRSp53 ) , neural - Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein or WASP family verprolin - homologous protein , and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( for review , see Ethell and Pasquale , 2005 ) . Recently , cortactin was also shown to regulate cellular mo - bility and actin cytoskeleton dynamics via regulation of Rac1 ( Lai et al . , 2009 ) . Thus , cortactin may use two mecha - nisms to regulate actin cytoskeleton dy - namics : direct binding to F - actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex , and via control of Rac1 activity ( Fig . 9 A ) . Our data suggest that CTTNBP2 is re - quired for anchoring cortactin at den - dritic spines . CTTNBP2 may thus direct cortactin - dependent actin dynamics at dendritic spines and control spine mor - phology and density . When CTTNBP2 protein levels are reduced , endogenous cortactin is unable to target dendritic spines to maintain the structure of these spines . When cortactin is overexpressed in CTTNBP2 knock - down neurons , cor - tactin ectopically distributes into the den - dritic spines , thus rescuing the spine defects caused by CTTNBP2 knockdown ( Fig . 9 B ) . It is not yet clear how CTTNBP2 stably resides at dendritic spines . If CTTNBP2 as - sociates with the striatin – PP2A protein complex , similar to CTTNBP2NL ( Gaillard etal . , 2006 ; Goudreaultetal . , 2009 ) , itwillbe interesting to examine whether the PP2A complex is involved in the CTTNBP2 distribution in dendritic spines . On the other hand , it is also possible that synaptic distribution of the PP2A complex is dependent on CTTNBP2 . Synapses , the sites where neurons transmit signals to other cells , may be compromised in autism or other psychiatric disorders . The Shank protein family interacts with cortactin to regulate the size and / ordensityofdendriticspines ( Salaetal . , 2001 ; Hungetal . , 2008 ; Durand et al . , 2011 ) . Human genetic studies have demonstrated the association of Shank3 mutations with autism or other psychiatric disorders ( Bonaglia et al . , 2001 ; Durand et al . , 2007 ; Moessner et al . , 2007 ) . Interestingly , chromosome 7q31 , the location of CTTNBP2 , is an autism candidate region . The contribution of CTTNBP2 to dendritic spine formation highlights the possibility that CTTNBP2 participates in controlling cognitive functions related to autism or other psychiatric disorders .

B , CTTNBP2regulatescortactindistributionat dendritic spines and thus maintains spine structure . The presence of CTTNBP2 targets cortactin to the dendritic spines . When CTTNBP2 is knocked down , cortactin is not efficiently targeted to dendritic spines , leading to shrinkage of the spines . When cortactinisoverexpressedinCTTNBP2knock - downneurons , theectopicdistributionofcortactinintothedendriticspinesmaintains the spine structure and rescues the defects caused by CTTNBP2 knockdown . Thus far , it is unclear what mechanism or molecule anchorsCTTNBP2atthedendriticspines . ChenandHsueh • CTTNBP2RegulatesDendriticSpineFormation J .

The sequence around the alternative splicing sites is highly conserved from human to chicken ( data not shown ) , suggesting that expres - sion of CTTNBP2 splicing variants is conserved . To explore the role of CTTNBP2 in autism , it will be critical to focus on muta - tions located before exon 5 of CTTNBP2 , since the C - terminal half of the CTTNBP2 long - form protein is not present or exists in limited amounts in neurons . Exogenous CTTNBP2 proteins in COS cells are colocalized with cortactin and enriched at the cell cortex ( lamellipodia and intracellular puncta ) ; a similar distribution of GFP - cortactin was reported in NIH3T3 cells ( Kaksonen et al . , 2000 ) . Cortactin has been implicated in endocytosis because cortactin localizes with clathrin - coated pits ( Cao et al . , 2003 , 2010 ) and because the knockdown of cortactin impairs endo - cytosis ( Zhu et al . , 2005 ) . Cortactin may bind dynamin and thus couple the F - actin beneath the plasma membrane to en - docytic vesicles , providing physical force to separate endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane ( Zhu et al . , 2005 ) . A re - cent investigation has demonstrated that cortactin is required for endosomal segregation from early endosomes to late / recy - cling endosomes ( Ohashi et al . , 2011 ) . We also observed punc - tate colocalization of CTTNBP2 and cortactin , particularly in time - lapse imaging . Intracellular vesicles always associated with cortactin / CTTNBP2 puncta in COS cells , and thus CTT - NBP2 is likely also involved in endocytosis in neurons .
