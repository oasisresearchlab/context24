We previously found evident ﬁ lamentous actin ( F - actin ) aggregations in the developing shell ﬁ eld of the patellogastropod Lottia goshimai , indicating roles of actomyosin networks in the process . In the present study , we functionally characterized nonmuscle myosin II ( NM II ) , the key molecule in actomyosin networks , in the larval shell development of L . goshimai . Immunostaining revealed general colocalization of phosphorylated NM II and F - actin in the shell ﬁ eld . When inhibiting the phosphorylation of NM II using the speci ﬁ c inhibitor blebbistatin in one - or 2 - h periods during shell ﬁ eld morphogenesis ( 6 – 8 h post - fertilization , hpf ) , the larval shell plate was completely lost in the veliger larva ( 24 hpf ) . Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the nascent larval shell plate could not be developed in the manipulated larvae ( 10 hpf ) . Further investigations revealed that key events in shell ﬁ eld morphogenesis were inhibited by blebbistatin pulses , including invagination of the shell ﬁ eld and cell shape changes and cell rearrangements during shell ﬁ eld morphogenesis . These factors caused the changed morphology of the shell ﬁ eld , despite the roughly retained “ rosette ” organization . To explore whether the speci ﬁ cation of related cells was affected by blebbistatin treatments , we investigated the expression of four potential shell formation genes ( bmp2 / 4 , gata2 / 3 , hox1 and engrailed ) . The four genes did not show evident changes in expression level , indicating unaffected cell speci ﬁ cation in the shell ﬁ eld , while the gene expression patterns showed variations according to the altered morphology of the shell ﬁ eld . Together , our results reveal that NM II contributes to the morphogenesis of the shell ﬁ eld and is crucial for the formation of the larval shell plate in L . goshimai . These results add to the knowledge of the mechanisms of molluskan shell development . Keywords : Lottia goshimai , shell , actomyosin , F - actin , nonmuscle myosin II INTRODUCTION Mollusks develop their shells at early developmental stages . In most molluskan lineages ( conchiferans ) , a shell plate can be observed shortly after the completion of gastrulation ( e . g . , in trochophores ) on the dorsal side of the embryo / larva . The nascent shell plates show high similarities among conchiferan clades , such as bivalves and gastropods ( Bielefeld and becker , 1991 ; Mouëza et al . , Edited by : Jong Tai Chun , Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn Napoli , Italy Reviewed by : Alf Mansson , Linnaeus University , Sweden Mirco Müller - Olling , Paul - Ehrlich - Institut ( PEI ) , Germany * Correspondence : Baozhong Liu bzliu @ qdio . ac . cn † These authors contributed equally to this work .

In previous studies , different terms have been used to refer to the tissue that develops during embryogenesis and subsequently secretes the larval shell plate . As mentioned previously ( Yang et al . , 2020 ) , here , we use the term “ shell ﬁ eld ” to refer to this tissue , which we think will facilitate interspecies comparisons . The shell ﬁ elds of conchiferans typically exhibit concentric organizations , i . e . , a “ rosette ” pattern , with different types of cells arranged in varied distances with respect to its center ( Kniprath , 1981 ) . The morphogenesis of the shell ﬁ eld represents an essential phase of shell development and thus has been investigated in various gastropod and bivalve lineages ( Kniprath , 1980 ; Eyster , 1983 ; Mouëza et al . , 2006 ; Silberfeld and Gros , 2006 ; Hohagen and Jackson , 2013 ) . Despite the considerable interspecies variations , a common developmental process of the shell ﬁ eld is that it invaginates in the early developmental phase ( Kniprath , 1981 ) . Such invagination can generate a pore on the dorsal side that can be much wider than the blastopore on the ventral side , forming a prominent feature of molluskan embryos ( Tomlinson , 1987 ; Mouëza et al . , 2006 ; Tan et al . , 2017 ) . In some species , the margin tissues seal the invaginated shell ﬁ eld to form a closed lumen ( Eyster , 1983 ; Hohagen and Jackson , 2013 ) . Given the common invagination process during shell ﬁ eld morphogenesis , it can be expected that it may have existed in the common molluskan ( conchiferan ) ancestor . The mechanisms underlying this process thus may contribute to understanding the origin and evolution of molluskan shells , yet they remain largely unclear . We recently investigated shell development in the patellogastropod Lottia goshimai , which is phylogenetically distant from many other gastropods ( e . g . , Lymnaea or Ilyanassa ) . The shell ﬁ eld morphogenesis of L . goshimai shows quite different characteristics compared with those of other gastropods , such as Lymnaea ( Hohagen and Jackson , 2013 ) and Aeolidia ( Eyster , 1983 ) . For instance , its shell ﬁ eld only exhibits slight invagination and shows constant contact with meso / endodermal tissues during morphogenesis ( Yang et al . , 2020 ) . Moreover , we found that ﬁ lamentous actin ( F - actin ) was aggregated in the shell ﬁ eld of L . goshimai ( Yang et al . , 2020 ) . To the best of our knowledge , this phenomenon has not been reported in other molluskan lineages . In L . goshimai , F - actin starts its aggregation 6 h post - fertilization ( hpf ) ( Figure 1 ) . Coincidently , this period is also the stage when the shell ﬁ eld starts to show evident morphogenetic changes ( invagination ) . Moreover , the central region of the shell ﬁ eld , which shows the strongest F - actin aggregation , exhibits maximum invagination ( Yang et al . , 2020 ) . Thus , F - actin aggregation and invagination of the shell ﬁ eld exhibit temporal and spatial correlations , which strongly suggests that F - actin participates in the invagination of the shell ﬁ eld , possibly by mediating a force - driven process . Generally , F - actin - mediated force - driven processes involve nonmuscle myosin II ( NM II ) , which supplies energy for mechanical forces , and the two molecules together form actomyosin networks ( Jacinto and Baum , 2003 ; Agarwal and Zaidel - Bar , 2019 ) . Based on this idea , in the present study , we explored the functions of NM II in the shell development of L . goshimai . The results supported the crucial role of NM II ( actomyosin networks ) in the morphogenesis of the shell ﬁ eld as well as in the formation of larval shell plates in L . goshimai . MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals Adult L . goshimai Nakayama , Sasaki & Nakano , 2017 , were collected from intertidal rocks in Qingdao , China . Gamete collection and arti ﬁ cial fertilization were performed as previously described ( Huan et al . , 2020 ) . Fertilized eggs were cultured in ﬁ ltered seawater ( FSW ) containing antibiotics ( 100 unit / mL benzylpenicillin and 200 μ g / ml streptomycin sulfate ) in an incubator at 25 ° C . Drug Treatment Blebbistatin ( Selleckchem , S7099 ) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) at a concentration of 10 mM to prepare the storage solution , and it was stored at − 80 ° C . Drug treatment experiments were performed using 6 - well plates . At the desired developmental stage ( 6 or 7 hpf ) , the storage blebbistatin solution was added to the seawater to a ﬁ nal concentration of 15 μ M . After one or 2 hours , the blebbistatin was removed from the culture system by washing with FSW at least three times , and the embryos were ﬁ xed immediately or raised to 10 or 24 hpf . In total , three types of treatments were performed ( 6 - 7 , 7 - 8 and 6 - 8 pulses ; see Figure 1 ) . Equivalent volumes of DMSO were added to the seawater in the control groups , and the same treatment time windows were used . Three batches of embryos derived from different female parents were used for every treatment to ensure reproducibility . Sample ﬁ xations were conducted as previously described with minor modi ﬁ cations ( Koop et al . , 2007 ; Fritsch et al . , 2016 ; Kristof et al . , 2016 ; Henry et al . , 2017 ) . In brief , samples for immunostaining , phalloidin staining and whole mount in situ hybridization ( WMISH ) were ﬁ xed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) ( 1 × PBS , 100 mM EDTA , 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 , pH 7 . 4 ) overnight at 4 ° C . For scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) , the samples were ﬁ xed in 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde ( diluted in 1 × PBS with 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ) overnight at 4 ° C . To explore larval shell development , the 24 - hpf larvae were relaxed in 125 mM magnesium chloride and then ﬁ xed in 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde for 2 h at room temperature . After ﬁ xation , the samples were washed several times with PBST ( 1 × PBS with 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ) and stored at 4 ° C until use . For WMISH , the samples were dehydrated to 100 % methanol and stored at − 20 ° C . Immunostaining and Phalloidin Staining A primary antibody ( Cell Signaling , 3671S ) was used to recognize the conserved phosphorylated residues ( Ser19 ) of the light chain Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org February 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 813741 2 Liu et al . Larval Shell Formation Requires NM II of NM II . This antibody has been shown to stain phosphorylated NM II ( pNM II ) in mollusks ( Toledo - Jacobo et al . , 2019 ) . For immunostaining , samples were ﬁ rst permeabilized with 1 % Triton X - 100 ( in 1 × PBS ) for 10 min and then treated with 0 . 05 % trypsin ( in PBST ) for 10 min at room temperature ( RT ) . After washing with PBST , the specimens were blocked in blocking solution ( 0 . 5 % blocking reagent ( Roche ) in PBST ) for 1 h at RT . Samples were then incubated with blocking solution containing the primary antibody ( 1 : 100 ) and tetramethylrhodamine - labeled phalloidin ( Solarbio , CA1610 , 1 : 200 ) overnight at 4 ° C . Stained samples were washed ﬁ ve times in PBST at 10 - min intervals and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 - coupled goat anti - rabbit secondary antibody ( Proteintech , SA00013 - 2 , 1 : 200 in PBST ) for 1 h at RT . Samples were rotated for incubation with the blocking solution or antibodies . WMISH , Scanning Electron Microscopy and Imaging Samples for SEM were dehydrated to ethanol , followed by a previous procedure before being submitted to SEM ( Tan et al . , 2017 ) . SEM was performed under a Hitachi S - 3400N scanning electron microscope . WMISH was performed as described previously ( Huan et al . , 2020 ) ; the sequences of the primers are provided in Supplementary Table S1 . WMISH and immunostaining samples were mounted in 90 % glycerol and observed under a Nikon 80i microscope or a ZEISS LSM 710 laser - scanning confocal microscope . In particular , the manipulated 24 - hpf larvae were recorded under DIC ( differential interference contrast ) mode of a Nikon 80i microscope . The parameters of DIC microscopy were carefully adjusted to show the birefringent materials that could re ﬂ ect the nature of shell materials . Reproducibility In the immunostaining assay performed in normal embryos , three different batches of embryos were used , and at least 20 individuals of each batch were investigated to ensure that they showed consistent results . For the blebbistatin - treated samples , in each phalloidin staining , WMISH and immunostaining assay , the distributions of signals were highly consistent in the manipulated or control group and were evidently different between groups . Thus , the results were determined by visual inspections , and the numbers of individuals were recorded ( shown in Figures 5 – 7 ) . This strategy was also applied in the assay to assess larval shell development in 24 - hpf veliger larvae ( Figure 3 ) . For the SEM experiments , since the samples could not be rotated during observations , the investigation of each individual was not applicable . Given that the orientations of the samples varied under SEM , we could only record the samples for which the dorsal side could be discriminated . We con ﬁ rmed that at least ﬁ ve larvae showed discriminable shell ﬁ elds in each trial , and their phenotypes were highly consistent . RESULTS Phosphorylated Nonmuscle Myosin II Colocalized With Aggregated F - Actin in the Shell Field NM II is phosphorylated for activation . Thus , to explore whether NM II is involved in shell development , we ﬁ rst investigated the distributions of pNM II . In normal development , morphogenesis of the shell ﬁ eld starts before 7 hpf and is generally completed at 8 hpf ; the nascent shell plate emerges beginning at 9 hpf ( Figure 1 ) . Therefore , we focused on the period from 6 to 10 hpf . The results revealed aggregations of pNM II in the shell ﬁ eld beginning at 8 hpf . In particular , in 8 - hpf embryos in which the clearest pNM II signals could be discriminated , it was distributed in the cortical region of shell ﬁ eld cells ( Figure 2G , G ’ ) . This distribution pattern was highly similar to that of F - actin ( Figures 2H , H ’ , I , I ’ ) . At earlier stages ( 6 - 7 hpf ) , although aggregations of F - actin could be recognizable ( Figures 2B , C , E , F ) , those of pNM II were not detectable ( Figures 2A , D ) . This difference may be caused by the relatively low immunostaining signals of pNM II and relatively high ﬂ uorescence levels in the cytoplasm compared with those of F - actin . The ﬂ uorescence in the cytoplasm after pNM II staining was likely caused by the binding of the primary antibody in the region , which could be unspeci ﬁ c binding , or the binding to the pNM II in intracellular vehicles ( e . g . , Miklavc et al . , 2012 ; Bedi et al . , 2017 ) , and we found it could not be further reduced after trying several available procedures . When the shell plate was developed at 9 and 10 hpf , aggregations of both F - actin and pNM II could also be detected in the shell ﬁ eld ( i . e . , the larval mantle , with stronger signals in the peripheral region ; Figures 2J – O ) , despite the relatively low resolutions . Blebbistatin Pulses Prevented the Formation of Larval Shell Plates We next investigated the roles of NM II by treating the embryos with the speci ﬁ c inhibitor blebbistatin . This small molecule drug ( Straight et al . , 2003 ) has been widely used to inhibit the functions of NM II in animals ( Lyons and Weisblat , 2009 ; Dong et al . , 2011 ) . Since morphogenesis of the shell ﬁ eld occurred between 6 and 8 hpf , we focused on this stage in the drug treatment experiments . Speci ﬁ cally , pulse experiments in one - or 2 - h periods were performed , namely , 6 - 7 , 7 - 8 , and 6 - 8 hpf pulses ( Figure 1 ) . We ﬁ rst investigated the development of larval shells in 24 - hpf veliger larvae , given that they exhibited the most characteristic larval shell plate . As shown in Figure 3 , the control veliger larvae exhibited a well - developed shell plate that could encompass the whole larval body ( Figure 3A ) . However , the manipulated larvae of any group did not exhibit a recognizable shell plate ( Figures 3B – D ) . Most of these larvae possessed birefringent materials , which were likely residual shell materials ( Figures 3B – D ) . These birefringent materials may have common chemical compositions comparable to a normal shell plate . However , the correct organization is crucial for a shell plate from a biological Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org February 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 813741 3 Liu et al .

Thus , theperiod from6to8 hpf should be the key stage for the morphogenesis of the shell ﬁ eld . We found that F - actin gradually aggregated in the shell ﬁ eld during this period ( lower row ) . The question marks indicate that we did not determine whether F - actin aggregations were detectable in subsequent developmental stages . The design of the blebbistatin treatment experiments is shown below , which includes pulses in three time windows . FIGURE 2 | Distribution of pNM II and F - actin during larval shell development . The pNM II was detected using a speci ﬁ c antibody . Its signals could be best discerned at 8 hpf , which showed high degrees of colocalization with F - actin .

We considered that a molluskan larval shell plate should have a determined shape , itself composed of a relatively thin layer of mineralized materials . We therefore did not recognize the somewhat irregularly shaped , birefringent masses in the treated larvae to be a certain type of shell plate . To explore more details , we investigated an earlier developmental stage , i . e . , 10 hpf . At this stage , the control larvae developed a nascent shell plate covering the center of the shell ﬁ eld ( Figures 4A , E ) . In contrast , only a residual shell piece could be observed at the posterior margin of the shell ﬁ eld in FIGURE 4 | Shell development at 10 hpf after blebbistatin treatments .

Larval Shell Formation Requires NM II the manipulated larvae ( Figures 4B – D and Figures 4F – H ) . These shell pieces were likely composed of a thin layer of shell materials comparable to the normal nascent shell plate , but they were incomplete and could not cover the central region of the shell ﬁ eld that exhibited surface protrusions ( compare Figures 4E – H ) . Given that the normal shell plate began its formation at the posterior margin of the shell ﬁ eld ( Yang et al . , 2020 ) , these results seem to indicate that shell formation in the manipulated larvae was disturbed since the early phases of its formation . Changes in the Shell Field Morphology After Blebbistatin Treatment We checked the distributions of F - actin and pNM II after blebbistatin treatments . pNM II was largely eliminated after the treatment ( Figures 5A – E ) , indicating successful inhibition of NM II phosphorylation . We found that the aggregation of F - actin was also greatly reduced . At 7 hpf , F - actin in the normal shell ﬁ eld showed a trend of aggregation ( Figures 5F , K ) , but this trend was not observed in the embryos treated with blebbistatin from 6 to 7 hpf ( Figures 5G , L ) . At 8 hpf , the aggregation of F - actin was particularly evident in control embryos ( Figures 5H , M ) . However , this aggregation was strongly inhibited in the embryos treated with blebbistatin beginning at 6 hpf ( Figures 5J , O ) . In the 7 - 8 pulse group , F - actin staining in the presumptive shell ﬁ eld was still detectable but showed an evident reduction ( Figures 5I , N ) . F - actin staining further revealed changes in the organization of the shell ﬁ eld . At 7 hpf , no obvious changes were observed in the shape of shell ﬁ eld cells in manipulated embryos ( Figure 5P , Q ) . At 8 hpf , the normal shell ﬁ eld in the control groups showed evident invagination at the central region ( white arrow in Figure 5R ) , and the cells generally elongated and showed a ﬂ ask shape ( Figure 5R ) . In contrast , the shell ﬁ eld in the manipulated embryos ( for both the 7 - 8 and 6 - 8 pulse groups ) no longer invaginated ( white dashed arrows in Figures 5S , T ) , suggesting that the invagination of the shell ﬁ eld was inhibited by the blebbistatin treatments . The cells of the shell ﬁ eld also generally showed a column shape ( Figures 5S , T ) , which was very different from the ﬂ ask - shaped cells in control embryos ( Figure 5R ) . In addition , although we did not quantify it , the elongation of the shell ﬁ eld cells seemed to also be inhibited ( compare the labeled cells in Figures 5S , T to that in Figure 5R ) . The Shell Field Showed Altered Organization , but the Cell Speci ﬁ cation Was Not Greatly Disrupted Although the most common role of actomyosin networks in animal development is to mediate morphogenetic changes , such as cell shape changes , the mechanical force they generate or propagate may generate additional effects on the cell ( Heisenberg and Bellaiche , 2013 ) . For instance , NM II can affect the speci ﬁ cation of neural crest cells ( Kim et al . , 2015 ) . Given that the formation of larval shell plates was seriously interrupted by blebbistatin treatments , we investigated whether the speci ﬁ cation of shell ﬁ eld cells was affected by exploring the expression of related genes . Four potential shell - formation ( pSF ) genes that showed speci ﬁ c expression in the shell ﬁ eld were used , including bmp2 / 4 , gata2 / 3 , engrailed and hox1 ( Yang et al . , 2020 ) . Although the speci ﬁ c roles of these genes in shell development are unknown , we proposed that their expression might re ﬂ ect the speci ﬁ cation of related cells . The results revealed comparable expression levels of the four genes between control and manipulated embryos . This was observed either at 8 hpf , when the morphogenesis of the shell ﬁ eld was generally completed , or at 10 hpf , when the shell plate was formed ( Figure 6 , Figure 7 ) . Conversely , we found that the expression patterns of the genes were substantially different between the control and manipulated samples . At 8 hpf , the expression of the four genes in control embryos showed a generally U - shaped pattern ( Figures 6A – D ) ; however , that in the manipulated larvae exhibited a relatively linear pattern ( Figures 6E – P ) . From the posterior view , the gene expression after blebbistatin treatments mostly spread to lateral tissues ( Figures 6E ’ – P ’ ) , in contrast to that in control embryos that was restricted to dorsal tissues ( Figures 6A ’ – D ’ ) . At 10 hpf , the expression of bmp2 / 4 , gata2 / 3 and hox1 exhibited an imaginary circle in control larvae ( Figures 7A – C ) , outlining the shell plate that had been developed during this stage ( Figure 4A ) . In the manipulated larvae , in contrast , the expression of the genes showed a U - shaped pattern ( Figures 7F – H , K - M , P – R ) but never succeeded in forming a circular pattern . As a sole exception , the expression of engrailed did not show a circular pattern at 10 hpf , and we did not detect evident changes in engrailed expression patterns between control and manipulated larvae ( Figures 7D , I , N , S ) . Given that the four pSF genes mentioned above may not be directly involved in shell material secretion , we further investigated a gene that might be involved in shell biogenesis , a tyrosinase gene . This gene was suggested to be a biogenesis gene of larval shell in the oyster Crassostrea gigas ( Huan et al . , 2013 ) , and similar roles in L . goshimai have been supported with comparable expression patterns ( Tan et al . , 2018 ) . We found that L . goshimai tyrosinase showed comparable expression levels at 10 hpf between manipulated and control larvae ( Figures 7E , J , O , T ) , seeming to indicate that the capacity to secrete shell materials was not inhibited by blebbistatin . However , similar to the other four pSF genes , tyrosinase expression patterns changed after blebbistatin treatment . Speci ﬁ cally , the anterior edge of its expression regions became linear in manipulated larvae , especially in the treatments that were terminated at 8 hpf ( dashed lines in Figures 7E , J , O , T ) . DISCUSSION Despite extensive investigations on the development of molluskan shell ﬁ elds ( Kniprath , 1981 ) , the involvement of F - actin has not been reported previously . Conversely , given the common invagination process during shell ﬁ eld morphogenesis in many mollusks ( Kniprath , 1981 ) and the common roles of actomyosin networks in tissue morphogenesis ( Jacinto and Baum , 2003 ; Vicente - Manzanares et al . , 2009 ; Heissler and Manstein , 2013 ; Agarwal and Zaidel - Bar , Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org February 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 813741 6 Liu et al . Larval Shell Formation Requires NM II 2019 ) , it is not surprising to observe the aggregations of F - actin and to speculate the involvement of the actomyosin networks in molluskan shell development . In the present study , we focused on NM II , which is the core molecule in actomyosin networks , in early molluskan shell development . As expected , our results revealed aggregations of pNM II in the shell ﬁ eld , which largely colocalized with F - actin when discriminable ( at 8 hpf , Figure 2 ) . Similar colocalization of the two molecules was also observed in various force - driven processes , such as the compartment boundaries in the wing disc of Drosophila and the notochord cells of Ciona during tubulogenesis ( Major and Irvine , 2006 ; Dong et al . , 2011 ) , supporting the idea that shell ﬁ eld morphogenesis involves force - driven processes mediated by actomyosin networks . This notion was subsequently supported by functional experiments using blebbistatin , a speci ﬁ c inhibitor of NM II . Given that we detected tight correlations between F - actin and pNM II ( in both normal and manipulated embryos ) , in the subsequent text , we will consider blebbistatin - treated experiments to indicate the roles of not only NM II but also the actomyosin networks when this generalization is necessary . NM II Functions in Shell Field Morphogenesis but Seemingly Does Not Regulate Cell Speci ﬁ cation Invagination in the early phase of shell ﬁ eld development has been revealed in various mollusks ( Kniprath , 1981 ) . However , even though it has been suggested that endodermal tissues induce invagination in some species [ such as Lymnaea ( Hohagen and jackson , 2013 ) ] , to the best of our knowledge , there are no reports aiming to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying this process . We found that the invagination of the shell ﬁ eld was inhibited by blebbistatin treatments , con ﬁ rming the role of NM II in this process . This result would help to promote the in - depth understanding of this common process of molluskan shell ﬁ eld development ( see below ) . Our previous results indicate that the shell ﬁ eld morphogenesis of L . goshimai involves extensive morphogenetic changes , such as “ cell movements ” and cell shape changes ( Yang et al . , 2020 ) . The shape changes of shell ﬁ eld cells include mainly elongation along the apical - basal axis and contractions at the apical side , together transforming the column cells into a ﬂ ask shape ( Yang et al . , 2020 ) . After blebbistatin treatments , we found that the cells remained column - shaped and likely no longer elongated , as in control embryos , which suggested that the cell shape changes during normal shell ﬁ eld morphogenesis were mediated by NM II or actomyosin networks . Given that cell shape changes occur at the single - cell level , they may involve asymmetrical distributions of actomyosin networks inside a cell ( Agarwal and Zaidel - Bar , 2019 ) . Indeed , we detected asymmetrical F - actin distribution along the apical - basal axis of the shell ﬁ eld cells ( Figure 5R ) . However , comparable asymmetrical distribution patterns were not detected for pNM II , potentially because of the relatively low immunostaining signals of pNM II and the relatively high background ﬂ uorescence ; improved immunostaining procedures may aid in explorations of whether pNM II is asymmetrically distributed at the subcellular level . “ Cell movements ” during shell ﬁ eld morphogenesis refer to the relative changes in the location of shell ﬁ eld cells from the ventral and lateral sides to the dorsal side , as indicated by the continuous changes in pSF gene expression regions ( Yang et al . , 2020 ) . Recently , we found that these changes in cellular locations should be attributed to complicated morphogenetic changes that include not only cell movements but also other types of developmental events ( e . g . , axial elongation ) ( Tan et al . , 2021 ) .

Larval Shell Formation Requires NM II Thus , we think “ cell rearrangement ” should be a more precise term to refer to this process . After blebbistatin treatments , we found that the expression of the four pSF genes at 8 hpf resembled that in an earlier normal embryo , characteristic of gene expression regions spreading to lateral tissues and the dorsal expression exhibiting a relatively straight pattern . These results indicated that the blebbistatin treatments inhibited cell rearrangements during shell ﬁ eld morphogenesis and thus revealed the roles of NM II in this process . Altogether , our results indicate that NM II ( actomyosin networks ) mediates the major morphogenetic changes during shell ﬁ eld development in L . goshimai , including invagination of the shell ﬁ eld , cell shape changes and cell rearrangements , thereby unraveling an important molecule underlying the morphogenesis of the shell ﬁ eld . Moreover , it would be intriguing to explore whether these processes are mediated by common cellular mechanisms . Theoretically , a presumptive contractile force toward the central area of the shell ﬁ eld , as well as toward the internal of the embryo , would underpin all three processes . As mentioned above , actomyosin can participate in cell speci ﬁ cations in a particular developmental process ( e . g . , Kim et al . , 2015 ) . Therefore , one should not assume the roles of NM II to be restricted to morphogenetic processes such as invagination . Thus , we investigated the expression of several pSF genes to explore whether NM II participates in the speci ﬁ cation of shell ﬁ eld cells . Despite the considerable changes in expression patterns after blebbistatin treatments , we did not detect evident variations in the expression levels of pSF genes when shell ﬁ eld morphogenesis was completed ( 8 hpf ) . This result seemed to indicate that the actomyosin networks were not involved in the regulation of these genes ( thus the speci ﬁ cation of related cells ) . However , it is too soon to reach this conclusion since the genes we investigated were still limited and unrecognized gene expression changes could be involved . Investigations of additional pSF genes are required to assess the roles of actomyosin networks in the cell speci ﬁ cations of the shell ﬁ eld .

Larval Shell Formation Requires NM II Potential Prevalence of the Involvement of Actomyosin Networks in the Morphogenesis of Molluskan Shell Fields Given the prevalence of shell ﬁ eld invagination in mollusks ( Kniprath , 1981 ) and the roles of actomyosin networks in L . goshimai , it would be intriguing to ask whether actomyosin networks would also mediate shell ﬁ eld invagination in other molluskan lineages . If this were true , one would expect to detect aggregations of F - actin in the shell ﬁ eld in various molluskan lineages . However , although investigations of F - actin in molluskan embryos / larvae have been extensive ( Wanninger et al . , 1999 ; Wanninger and Haszprunar , 2002 ; Dyachuk and Odintsova , 2009 ; Kristof et al . , 2016 ; Battonyai et al . , 2018 ; Yurchenko et al . , 2018 ) , F - actin staining was mainly used to detect muscular tissues in late larvae ( e . g . , veliger ) . Even though early embryos / larvae are investigated occasionally ( Wanninger et al . , 1999 ) , the very strong F - actin signals in the muscular cells may have affected the detection of F - actin in nonmuscular tissues . To the best of our knowledge , two studies investigated F - actin distributions without focusing on the muscular system . In the bivalve Saccostrea kegaki , Kin et al . did not reveal F - actin aggregation in the 48 - cell embryo , although the shell ﬁ eld started its early morphogenesis at this stage ( X cells that would comprise the shell ﬁ eld emerged , and they showed a trend of invagination ) ( Kin et al . , 2009 ) . Thus , this result seems to not support the role of actomyosin networks in the shell ﬁ eld morphogenesis of Saccostrea . However , the lack of F - actin aggregation in Saccostrea could be interpreted as indicating that the embryo was at too early a stage of shell ﬁ eld morphogenesis and that aggregation might be expected at later stages . In the gastropod Ilyanassa obsoleta , in contrast , strong F - actin staining could be observed in the margin of the shell ﬁ eld ( the newly formed mantle ) in the four - day - old embryo ( Johnson et al . , 2019 ) , when the shell plate is at its early phase of growth . This distribution pattern of F - actin in Ilyanassa embryos is highly similar to what we observed in the early trochophores of L . goshimai ( Figure 2 ) , suggesting the common involvement of actomyosin networks in shell development in the two species . Nevertheless , since shell ﬁ eld morphogenesis has been completed in four - day - old Ilyanassa embryos ( in particular , invagination has ﬁ nished ) , it is also possible that the strong F - actin signals in Ilyanassa re ﬂ ect the developing muscular tissues in the mantle [ as seen in many mollusks ( Audino et al . , 2015 ) ] . Altogether , current data do not simply support or deny the widespread involvement of actomyosin networks in molluskan shell ﬁ eld morphogenesis . Investigating F - actin in the developing shell ﬁ eld in multiple molluskan species ( especially during invagination ) is necessary to explore the prevalence of this mechanism . NM II Is Crucial for the Formation of Larval Shell Plates We found that although the morphology of the shell ﬁ eld was only moderately inhibited after short - term NM II pulses , such treatments were suf ﬁ cient to prevent the initial formation of the shell plate ( 10 hpf , Figure 4 ) , followed by the complete loss of the shell plate in the veliger larvae ( 24 hpf , Figure 3 ) . We suspected that this might be due to the loss of the capacity of the larvae to synthesize shell materials . However , the relatively unchanged expression level of tyrosinase , a potential shell biogenesis gene , indicated that the capacity to synthesize the shell materials was likely unaffected . This idea was further supported by the incomplete but evident residual shell pieces in manipulated 10 - hpf trochophore larvae ( Figure 4 ) . Despite being seriously reduced , these residual shell pieces suggested that the shell materials could be synthesized , secreted into extracellular spaces , and ﬁ nally form the shell ( albeit incomplete ) . We propose two possibilities to explain the lack of larval shell plates after the blebbistatin treatments . First , the capacity to secrete shell materials may have been inhibited by the treatments . NM II has been revealed to function in intracellular traf ﬁ cking and secretion ( Miklavc et al . , 2012 ; Bedi et al . , 2017 ) . It is possible that inhibition of NM II function results in an impaired secreting capacity of related cells , which may not be able to meet the requirement to form a complete shell plate but can only catalyze the formation of a residual shell piece . Alternatively , it is possible that the formation of a complete shell plate requires the coordination of different cells , which relies on a particular organization of the shell ﬁ eld . Blebbistatin treatments caused changes in the organization of the shell ﬁ eld ( despite the possibly unaffected cell fates ) , which might destroy the coordination of different cells and thus affect the formation of the shell plate . This idea is partially supported by the highly regular organization of the cells inside the shell ﬁ eld immediately before shell secretion ( Kniprath , 1981 ) . Previous studies have also revealed that the shell materials secreted by different cells are transferred to the extracellular space , where they are catalyzed to crosslink with each other to form the shell plate ( Kniprath , 1980 ; Bielefeld and Becker , 1991 ) . It is possible that when the shell ﬁ eld became disorganized after the blebbistatin treatments , although the shell materials were secreted and translocated to extracellular regions , together they could not generate a correct arrangement to form a complete shell plate . This proposal is consistent with previous observations of manipulated embryos that frequently develop birefringent materials but do not show complete shell plates ( Clement , 1962 ; Boring and July 1989 ; Lambert and Nagy , 2001 ; Henry et al . , 2017 ) . Another notable fact is that short - term blebbistatin pulses during the morphogenesis of the shell ﬁ eld ( in as short as 1 hour ) were suf ﬁ cient to inhibit the formation of larval shell plates in late larvae ( 24 hpf ) . Even though the shell ﬁ eld exhibited a trend of restoration when blebbistatin was removed ( re ﬂ ected by the remerged U - shaped expression pattern of pSF genes and malformed but detectable shell pieces at 10 hpf ) , the capacity to form a shell plate appeared to never recover in the manipulated larvae , potentially because of the misspeci ﬁ cation of particular cells ( though not detected in the present study ) , lack of coordination of different cells in the disorganized shell ﬁ eld , or the lack of a structural base from a complete initial shell plate for subsequent shell growth . Further investigations are required Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org February 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 813741 9 Liu et al . Larval Shell Formation Requires NM II to explore the underlying causes . Despite these uncertainties , the present results undoubtedly indicate that the period between 6 and 8 hpf is crucial for shell ﬁ eld development , consistent with the time window showing aggregations of F - actin and that NM II is crucial for larval shell development .
