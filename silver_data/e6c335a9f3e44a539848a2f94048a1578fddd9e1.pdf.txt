While synchronous ﬁring of neurons is considered to be an important functional block in the brain , how STDP shapes neural networks possibly toward synchrony is not entirely clear . We examine relations between STDP and synchronous ﬁring in spontaneously ﬁring neural pop - ulations . Using coupled heterogeneous phase oscillators placed on initial networks , we show nu - merically that STDP prunes some synapses and promotes formation of a feedforward network . Eventually a pacemaker , which is the neuron with the fastest inherent frequency in our numerical simulations , emerges at the root of the feedforward network . In each oscillatory cycle , a packet of neural activity is propagated from the pacemaker to downstream neurons along layers of the feedforward network . This event occurs above a clear - cut threshold value of the initial synaptic weight . Below the threshold , neurons are self - organized into separate clusters each of which is a feedforward network . 1 I . INTRODUCTION Synchronous ﬁring of neurons has been widely observed and is considered to be a neural code that adds to ﬁring rates . For example , experimental evidence suggests the relevance of synchronous ﬁring in stimulus encoding [ 1 ] , feature binding [ 2 , 3 ] , and selective attention [ 3 , 4 ] . Collective dynamical states of neurons including synchrony may appear as a result of self - organization based on synaptic plasticity . Modiﬁcation of synaptic weights ( i . e . , weights of edges in the network terminology ) often occurs in a manner sensitive to relative spike timing of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons , which is called spike - timing - dependent plasticity ( STDP ) . In the commonly found asymmetric STDP , which we consider in this work , long - term potentiation ( LTP ) occurs when presynaptic ﬁring precedes postsynaptic ﬁring by tens of milliseconds or less , and long - term depression ( LTD ) occurs in the opposite case [ 5 ] . The amount of plasticity is larger when the diﬀerence in the presynaptic spike time and the postsynaptic spike time is smaller [ 5 ] . The asymmetric STDP reinforces causal pairs of presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes and eliminate other pairs . Based on this property of STDP , how STDP may lead to various forms of synchronous ﬁring has been studied in both experiments and theory . Synchronous ﬁring in the sense of simultaneity of spike timing can be established in recurrent neural networks when the strength of LTP and that of LTD are nearly balanced [ 6 ] . Large - scale numerical simulations suggest that reproducible spatiotemporal patterns of spike trains self - organize in heterogeneous recurrent neural networks [ 7 , 8 ] . Self - organization of clusters of synchronously ﬁring neurons that excite each other in a cyclic manner has also been reported [ 9 , 10 ] . We previously showed that STDP leads to formation of feedforward networks and entrain - ment when there is a pacemaker in the initial network [ 11 ] . We considered random networks of coupled oscillators whose synaptic weights change slowly via STDP . We assumed that the oscillators have a common inherent frequency except a single pacemaker whose inherent frequency is larger . By deﬁnition , the rhythm of the pacemaker is not aﬀected by those of other oscillators . The network generated via STDP is a feedforward network whose root is the pacemaker . In a ﬁnal network , a spike packet travels from the pacemaker to the other neurons in a laminar manner . The neurons directly postsynaptic to the pacemaker ﬁre more or less synchronously just after the pacemaker does . These neurons form the ﬁrst layer . These neurons induce synchronous ﬁring of the neurons directly postsynaptic to them , 2 which deﬁne the second layer . In this fashion , a spike packet starting from the pacemaker reaches the most downstream neurons within relatively short time , which resembles the phe - nomenology of the synﬁre chain [ 12 ] . Compared to the case of frozen synaptic weights , a pacemaker entrains the rest of the network more easily with STDP in the meaning that entrainment occurs with smaller initial synaptic weights . The previous work does not explain how pacemakers emerge . No matter whether the pacemakers are intrinsic oscillators or network oscillators , they pace rhythms of other ele - ments without being crucially aﬀected by other rhythms . Although some pacemakers may be “robust” oscillators whose rhythms are insensitive to general input , a more natural ex - planation may be that pacemakers emerge through synaptic plasticity in a neural network in which pacemakers are initially absent . In this case , emergent pacemakers do not have to be robust oscillators ; their rhythms can change in response to external input . The emergent network topology makes such neurons pacemakers by eliminating incoming synapses . A neuron would ﬁre with its own rhythm if it is not downstream to any neuron . This scenario is actually the case for two - neuron networks [ 11 , 13 ] . Here we are concerned to networks of more than two neurons . An associated question is which oscillator may become a pacemaker . In this work , we numerically investigate recurrent networks of coupled phase oscillators subject to STDP . We show that , when the initial synaptic weights are strong enough , STDP indeed yields feedforward networks so that downstream neurons are entrained by an emergent pacemaker . To our numerical evidence , the emergent pacemaker is always the neuron with the largest intrinsic frequency . Below the threshold for entrainment , STDP leads to the segregation of the initial neural network into subnetworks of feedforward networks . II . MODEL A . Coupled phase oscillators We model dynamics of neural networks by N coupled phase oscillators whose synaptic weights are plastic . Although a majority of real neurons ﬁre in the excitable ( i . e . , ﬂuctuation - driven ) regime , for tractability we use phase oscillators , which ﬁre in an oscillatory manner . Generally speaking , phase transitions are more easily and clearly determined in the oscilla - tory regime than in the excitable regime . This is a reason why collective neural dynamics 3 [ 14 , 15 ] including ones associated with STDP [ 6 , 11 , 16 ] have been analyzed in the oscillatory regime actually to give insights into dynamics of neural networks possibly operating in the excitable regime . In the following , we report numerical results for N = 3 and N = 100 . The state of neuron i ( 1 ≤ i ≤ N ) is represented by a phase variable φ i ∈ [ 0 , 2 π ) . We identify φ i = 0 and φ i = 2 π . When φ i crosses 0 in the positive direction , neuron i is deﬁned to ﬁre . We denote by t j and t i the spike time of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons . If φ i crosses 0 in the positive direction as time advances from t to t + ∆ t , we set t i = t + [ 2 π − φ i ( t ) ] / [ 2 π + φ i ( t + ∆ t ) − φ i ( t ) ] ∆ t . As the initial condition , we set φ i = 0 ( 1 ≤ i ≤ N ) for N = 3 . We adopt this artiﬁcial initial condition to draw phase diagrams to systematically understand possible routes to synchrony via STDP . For N = 100 , φ i ( 0 ) is picked randomly and independently for each i from the uniform density on [ 0 , 2 π ) . Neuron i is endowed with inherent frequency ω i so that it ﬁres regularly at rate ω i / 2 π when isolated . Connectivity between neurons is unidirectional and weighted , consistent with the properties of chemical synapses . The set of edges in a network is denoted by E . In other words , ( j , i ) ∈ E if neuron j is presynaptic to neuron i . Dynamics of the coupled phase oscillators are given by d φ i d t = ω i + 1 h k i X j : ( j , i ) ∈ E g ji sin ( φ j − φ i ) + σξ i , ( 1 ) where h k i is the average in - degree of neuron i , g ji is a synaptic weight , and ξ i represents the standard Gaussian white noise independent for diﬀerent i . As a result of the phase reduction theory [ 17 ] , the coupling term in the oscillatory regime is generally given by a 2 π - periodic function of the phase diﬀerence φ j − φ i under the assumption of weak coupling . This is also the case for pulse coupling , for which averaging an original pulse coupling term over one oscillatory cycle results in a coupling term as a function of φ j − φ i [ 14 ] . Modeling realistic synaptic coupling needs a coupling term that contains higher harmonics [ 14 ] . However , our objective in the present paper is not to precisely describe the neural dynamics but to clarify general consequences of STDP under the oscillatory condition . We thus employ the simplest coupling term ( i . e sinusoidal coupling ) . For N = 3 , we set the amplitude of the noise σ = 0 . 0071 so that the phase transitions are sharp enough and artiﬁcial resonance that is prone to occur when inherent frequencies satisfy M i ω i = M j ω j for small integers M i and M j ( 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N ) is avoided . Accordingly , an independent normal variable with mean 0 and standard deviation σ √ ∆ t = 0 . 00071 is 4 added to each neuron every time step ∆ t = 0 . 01 ; we use the Euler - Maruyama integration scheme with unit time ∆ t . To determine the phase transitions for N = 100 , we do not apply dynamical noise because , up to our numerical eﬀorts , the numerical results do not signiﬁcantly suﬀer from artiﬁcial resonance . In some other simulations with N = 100 , we add diﬀerent amplitudes of dynamical noise to examine the robustness of the results . B . STDP With STDP , g ji is repeatedly updated depending on spike timing of neuron j and i . Speciﬁcally , LTP occurs when a postsynaptic neuron ﬁres slightly after a presynaptic neuron does , and LTD occurs in the opposite case [ 5 ] . We assume that synaptic plasticity operates much more slowly than ﬁring dynamics . We denote by A + and A − the maximum amount of LTP and that of LTD incurred by a single STDP event . Most of previous theoretical work supposes that A − is somewhat , but not too much , larger than A + , to avoid explosion in ﬁring rates and to keep neurons ﬁring [ 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ] . Therefore we set A + / A − = 0 . 9 . How a single spike pair speciﬁcally modiﬁes the synaptic weight is under investigation [ 8 , 18 ] , and triplets or higher - order combination of presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes rather than a single presynaptic and postsynaptic spike pair may induce STDP [ 19 ] . However , we consider the simplest situation in which STDP modiﬁes synaptic weights in an additive manner and the amount of STDP is determined by the relative timing of a presynaptic and postsynaptic spike pair . A single synaptic modiﬁcation ∆ g ji triggered by a spike pair is represented by ∆ g ji =    A + exp ( − t j − t i τ ) t j − t i < 0 − A − exp ( t j − t i τ ) t j − t i > 0 , ( 2 ) where τ is the characteristic time scale of the learning window , which is known in experiments to be 10 - 20 ms [ 5 ] . Given that inherent frequencies of many pyramidal neurons roughly range between 5 and 20 Hz , τ is several times smaller than a characteristic average interspike interval . Therefore , following [ 11 ] , we set τ = 1 / 6 × 2 π / ω , where ω is a typical value of spike frequency that is used to determine ω i . Following our previous work [ 11 ] , we set ω = 8 . 1 . Because learning is slow compared to neural dynamics , A − must be by far smaller than a typical value of g . To satisfy this condition , we set A − = 0 . 001 for N = 3 . When N = 100 , average in - degree h k i is set equal to 10 . This implies that a neuron receives about ﬁve to 5 ten times more synapses than when N = 3 . To normalize this factor , we set it A − = 0 . 0001 for N = 100 . We assume that g ji is conﬁned in [ 0 , g max ] ; all the synapses are assumed to be excitatory , because the asymmetric STDP explained in Sec . I has been found mostly in excitatory synapses . Because dynamical noise is assumed not to be large , all the synaptic weights usually develop until g ji almost reaches either g max or 0 , until when we run each simulation run . Note that , even if g ji = 0 is reached , ( j , i ) still belongs to E . The upper limit g max is determined so that a notion of synchronization that we deﬁne in Sec . II C does not occur when g ji = g max , ∀ ( j , i ) ∈ E . Accordingly , we set g max = 7 . 5 and g max = 15 for N = 3 and N = 100 , respectively . C . Measurement of synchrony To obtain the threshold for synchrony in Secs . III A and III B 1 , we start numerical simula - tions with the initial condition g ji = g 0 , ∀ ( j , i ) ∈ E . There are various notions of synchrony . We focus on the possibility of frequency synchrony in which neurons ﬁre at the same rate . In the oscillatory regime , frequency synchrony is commonly achieved in two main ways . One is when neurons are connected by suﬃciently strong mutual coupling . Then they oscillate at the same rate and with proximate phases . The other is when some neurons entrain others . When upstream neurons , which serve as pacemakers , entrain downstream neurons so that they are synchronized in frequency , synchronous ﬁring in the sense of spike timing may be missing due to synaptic delay . However , neurons located at the same level in the hierarchy relative to the pacemakers tend to have close spike timing [ 11 , 20 ] . We explore possible emergence of such dynamics when pacemakers are initially absent in networks . We quantify the degree of frequency synchrony by order parameter r deﬁned by r = log 10   1 N X i ˜ ω i − 1 N X i ′ ˜ ω i ′ ! 2   , ( 3 ) where ˜ ω i = d φ i / d t is the actual instantaneous frequency of neuron i when coupled to other neurons . If all the neurons ﬁre exactly at the same rate , r would become negative inﬁnity . In the actual frequency synchrony , r takes a large negative value mainly because of time discretization . We manually set r c = − 4 for N = 3 and r c = − 9 for N = 100 , so that r ≤ r c corresponds to the full frequency synchrony . The value of r c for N = 100 is smaller than 6 for N = 3 for two reasons . First , in the numerical simulations determining the degree of frequency synchrony , dynamical noise is present for N = 3 and absent for N = 100 . Second , we are concerned to the frequency synchrony of all the neurons so that P i ( ˜ ω i − 1 / N P i ′ ˜ ω i ′ ) 2 is small regardless of N ; we have to normalize the prefactor 1 / N in Eq . ( 3 ) . III . RESULTS A . Networks of three neurons Our goal is to understand dynamics of large neural networks . As a starting point , we ex - amine network evolution and possibility of frequency synchrony using small networks , which will help us understand dynamics of large networks . Two - neuron networks were previously analyzed [ 11 ] . We need at least three neurons to understand competition between diﬀer - ent synapses , pruning of synapses , and eﬀects of heterogeneity . Accordingly , we examine dynamics of diﬀerent three - neuron networks under STDP . 1 . Complete graph Consider the complete graph [ Fig . 1 ( a ) ] , in which every pair of neurons is bidirectionally connected . The complete graph does not survive STDP because LTP of a synapse implies LTD of the synapse in the reversed direction and the amount of LTD is assumed to be larger than that of LTP for the same time lag . We examine which synapses survive and whether frequency synchrony emerges through STDP . If a predetermined pacemaker exists in a network , the activity of the other neurons will be entrained into the rhythm of the pacemaker with suﬃciently large initial synaptic weights , which was previously shown for N = 2 and N = 100 [ 11 ] . Here we consider N = 3 and compare numerical results when a pacemaker is initially present and absent in the complete graph . Note that the eﬀective initial network when the pacemaker neuron 1 is initially present is the one shown in Fig . 1 ( b ) , because the synapses toward the pacemaker are deﬁned to be entirely ineﬀective . First , we examine the relation between heterogeneity in inherent frequencies , initial synaptic weights , and synchrony . We expect that small heterogeneity and large initial synaptic weights favor synchrony . To focus on phase transitions , we reduce the number of parameters by setting all the initial synaptic weights equal to g 0 and restrain inherent 7 frequencies ω 1 , ω 2 , and ω 3 ( ω 1 ≥ ω 2 ≥ ω 3 ) by imposing , ω 1 − ω 2 = ω 2 − ω 3 ≡ ∆ ω , where ω 2 = 8 . 1 . Numerically obtained phase diagrams are shown in Figs . 2 ( a ) and 2 ( b ) for the cases in which a pacemaker is initially present and absent , respectively . The results are qualitatively the same for the two situations . The neurons get disconnected and ﬁre inde - pendently as a result of STDP for suﬃciently small g 0 or suﬃciently large ∆ ω ( blue regions labeled D ) . A feedforward network whose root is the fastest oscillator emerges for suﬃciently large g 0 or suﬃciently small ∆ ω ( yellow regions labeled A ) . Then all the neurons rotate at frequency ω 1 . In the intermediate regime ( green regions labeled C ) , ﬁnal synaptic weights satisfy g 23 ≈ g max and g 12 , g 13 , g 21 , g 31 , and g 32 ≈ 0 . In this case , neuron 2 entrains neuron 3 so that they oscillate at frequency ω 2 , whereas neuron 1 gets disconnected and oscillates at frequency ω 1 . We rarely observed the case in which neuron 1 entrains 2 ( or 3 ) and neuron 3 ( or 2 ) gets isolated . Although ω 1 − ω 2 = ω 2 − ω 3 , neuron 1 is more likely to segregate from the network than neuron 3 is . Quantitatively speaking , Figs . 2 ( a ) and 2 ( b ) indicate that the entrainment of the entire network by the fastest neuron ( i . e . , neuron 1 ) is to some extent easier to realize when the pacemaker is initially absent than present ( yellow regions labeled A ) . In Figs . 2 ( a ) and 2 ( b ) , the phase diagrams are disturbed along vertical lines at ∆ ω ≈ 2 . 7 . This artifact comes from the fact that ω 1 , ω 2 , and ω 3 approximately satisfy the resonance condition ( i . e . , M 1 ω 1 = M 2 ω 2 = M 3 ω 3 with small integers M 1 , M 2 , and M 3 ) . In some of the following ﬁgures , similar disturbance appears along special lines . We can wash away these artifacts by increasing the amount of dynamical noise . However , we prefer not doing so to prevent the boundaries between diﬀerent phases from being blurred too much . Next , to examine what happens when ω 1 , ω 2 , and ω 3 change independently , we set g 0 = 0 . 15 , ω 2 = 8 . 1 , and vary ∆ ω 1 ≡ ω 1 − ω 2 and ∆ ω 2 ≡ ω 2 − ω 3 . Numerical results with and without a pacemaker are shown in Figs . 2 ( c ) and 2 ( d ) , respectively . Figures 2 ( c ) and 2 ( d ) are similar to each other , except yellow spots in the red region ( labeled B ) in Fig . 2 ( c ) . These spots represent entrainment facilitated due to the artiﬁcial resonance condition satisﬁed by ω 1 , ω 2 , and ω 3 . Both in Figs . 2 ( c ) and 2 ( d ) , g 23 is easier to survive than g 12 is , consistent with Figs . 2 ( a ) and 2 ( b ) . This is indicated by the fact that the phase of the frequency synchrony of the three neurons ( yellow regions labeled A ) extends to a larger value of ∆ ω 2 > 0 along the line ∆ ω 1 = 0 than to the value of ∆ ω 1 > 0 along the line ∆ ω 2 = 0 , and that the phase in which neuron 2 entrains 3 ( green , C ) survives up to a larger value of ∆ ω 2 than the value of ∆ ω 1 up to which neuron 1 entrains neuron 2 but not neuron 3 ( red , B ) . 8 To examine the cause of the asymmetry in Figs . 2 ( c ) and 2 ( d ) along the two lines ∆ ω 1 = 0 and ∆ ω 2 = 0 , we analyze a two - neuron network with asymmetric initial synaptic weights shown in Fig . 3 ( a ) . The two neurons h and l have inherent frequency ω h and ω l ( ≤ ω h ) . The weights of the synapse from neuron h to neuron l and that from neuron l to neuron h are denoted by g f and g b , respectively . When ∆ ω 1 = 0 and ∆ ω 2 ≥ 0 in the three - neuron network , neurons 1 and 2 are synchronized almost from the beginning , in both frequency and phase , because ω 1 = ω 2 . This is true if a trivial condition g 12 + g 21 > 0 is satisﬁed . Then the network is reduced to the two - neuron network by identifying ω h = ω 1 = ω 2 , ω l = ω 3 , g f = g 13 + g 23 , and g b = ( g 21 + g 31 ) / 2 . When , ∆ ω 1 ≥ 0 and ∆ ω 2 = 0 in the three - neuron network , neurons 2 and 3 are synchronized in frequency and phase as far as g 23 + g 32 > 0 . Then the network is reduced to the two - neuron network with ω h = ω 1 , ω l = ω 2 = ω 3 , g f = ( g 12 + g 13 ) / 2 , and g b = g 21 + g 31 . For these two situations , we calculate the threshold for frequency synchrony in the two - neuron network using the semi - analytical method developed in [ 11 ] . Because all the synaptic weights are initially equal to g 0 in Fig . 2 , the initial condition for the two - neuron network is ( g f , g b ) = ( 2 g 0 , g 0 ) for ∆ ω 1 = 0 , ∆ ω 2 ≡ ∆ ω ≥ 0 , and ( g f , g b ) = ( g 0 , 2 g 0 ) for ∆ ω 1 ≡ ∆ ω ≥ 0 , ∆ ω 2 = 0 . The phase - transition curves for the frequency synchrony are shown in Fig . 3 ( b ) , indicating that the threshold is larger along the ∆ ω 2 = 0 line than along the ∆ ω 1 = 0 line . This is consistent with the three - neuron results shown in Figs . 2 ( c ) and 2 ( d ) . 2 . Feedforward loop Other three - neuron networks , particularly feedforward ones , are presumably embedded in larger neural networks in the course of network evolution . First , we consider the network shown Fig . 4 ( a ) as the initial network . Figure 4 ( a ) is the phase diagram in which we vary ∆ ω = ω 1 − ω 2 = ω 2 − ω 3 and g 0 = g 12 = g 13 = g 23 . The original network shown in Fig . 4 ( a ) survives STDP when initial synaptic weights are large or the heterogeneity is small ( yellow region labeled A ) . In the opposite situation , all the neurons get disconnected and ﬁre independently ( blue , D ) . Neuron 1 detaches from the network and neuron 2 entrains neuron 3 in the intermediate regime ( green , C ) . The phase diagram in the ∆ ω 1 - ∆ ω 2 parameter space with g 0 = 0 . 15 is shown in Fig . 4 ( b ) , 9 which looks similar to Figs . 2 ( c ) and 2 ( d ) . As in the case of the complete graph , the situation in which neuron 1 entrains neuron 2 with neuron 3 isolated is less likely to arise than that in which neuron 2 entrains neuron 3 with neuron 1 isolated . 3 . Fan - in network Next , we examine dynamics starting from the fan - in network shown in Fig . 5 ( a ) . In this network , neuron 3 is postsynaptic to two pacemaker neurons 1 and 2 . We are concerned to which neuron entrains neuron 3 . First , we examine the case in which two synapses are initially equally strong and the inherent frequencies of the two upstream neurons are diﬀerent . Accordingly we set g 13 = g 23 = g 0 , ω 1 − ω 3 ≡ ∆ ω 1 , ω 2 − ω 3 ≡ ∆ ω 2 , g 0 = 0 . 2 , and ω 3 = 8 . 1 . Figures 5 ( b ) and 5 ( c ) are the phase diagrams in the ∆ ω 1 - ∆ ω 2 space , with Fig . 5 ( c ) being an enlargement of Fig . 5 ( b ) . There are principally four phases : neither neuron 1 or 2 entrains neuron 3 ( blue regions labeled D ) , both neurons 1 and 2 entrain neuron 3 ( yellow , A ) , only neuron 1 entrains neuron 3 ( red , B ) , and only neuron 2 entrains neuron 3 ( green , C ) . The phase diagram is symmetric with respect to the diagonal line ∆ ω 1 = ∆ ω 2 . When ω 1 and ω 2 are too far from ω 3 , all the neurons get disconnected ( blue , D ) . Both g 13 and g 23 survive only when ω 1 ≈ ω 2 ( yellow , A ) . This phase extends to the disconnection phase ( blue , D ) on the diagonal because , on this line , the ﬁring of neuron 1 elicits LTP of both synapses so does ﬁring of neuron 2 . However , this situation is not generic in that ω 1 and ω 2 must be very close for this to happen . When ω 1 and ω 2 are not close to each other and not too far from ω 3 , which upstream neuron entrains neuron 3 is not obvious . Figure 5 ( b ) tells that a necessary condition for an upstream neuron to entrain neuron 3 is that the diﬀerence between its inherent frequency and ω 3 is less than ≈ 1 . 0 . This condition roughly corresponds to the requirement for the entrainment in the two - neuron feedforward network with g 0 = 0 . 2 . This explains the two rectangular regions ∆ ω 1 > 1 . 0 , ∆ ω 2 < 1 . 0 , and ∆ ω 1 < 1 . 0 , ∆ ω 2 > 1 . 0 of Fig . 5 ( b ) . In the remaining region ( i . e . ∆ ω 1 < 1 . 0 and ∆ ω 2 < 1 . 0 ) , the upstream neuron whose inherent frequency is closer to ω 3 , equivalently , the slower upstream neuron , largely wins the competition ( regions marked by (cid:3) ) . The faster upstream neuron entrains neuron 3 when the inherent frequency of the slower upstream neuron is very close to ω 3 ( regions marked by (cid:13) ) . The total size of the latter regions is much smaller than that of the former 10 regions . Starting with asymmetric synaptic weights , that is , g 13 6 = g 23 , the upstream neuron more strongly connected to neuron 3 may entrain neuron 3 . To investigate the interplay of this eﬀect and heterogeneity in the inherent frequency , we perform another set of numerical simulations with ω 1 = ω 3 + 1 , ω 2 = ω 1 + ∆ ω , g 13 = g 0 , and g 23 = g 0 + ∆ g 0 . The asymmetry in the initial synaptic weight is parameterized by ∆ g 0 . Figures 5 ( d ) - 5 ( f ) shows the phase diagrams in the ∆ ω - ∆ g 0 space for three diﬀerent values of ω 1 . On the singular line ∆ ω = 0 ( i . e . , ω 1 = ω 2 ) , ∆ g 0 ≥ 0 , both upstream neurons entrain neuron 3 . On the line ∆ ω ≥ 0 ( i . e . , ω 1 < ω 2 ) , ∆ g 0 = 0 , neuron 1 , whose inherent frequency ω 1 is closer to ω 3 than ω 2 is , entrains neuron 3 if ω 1 is not too apart from ω 3 [ Fig . 5 ( d ) ] . This is consistent with the results in Figs . 5 ( b ) and 5 ( c ) . However , if g 23 is suﬃciently larger than g 13 , neuron 2 overcomes the disadvantageous situation ω 2 − ω 3 > ω 1 − ω 3 to win against neuron 1 and entrains neuron 3 . We conﬁrmed that neuron 2 exclusively entrains neuron 3 when ∆ ω < 0 and ∆ g 0 > 0 ( not shown ) . B . Networks of many neurons In this section , we use networks of heterogeneous N = 100 neurons to examine what net - work structure and dynamics self - organize via STDP when we start from random neural net - works . The inherent frequencies of the neurons are independently picked from the truncated Gaussian distribution with mean 8 . 1 , standard deviation 0 . 5 , and support ω i ∈ [ 7 . 6 , 8 . 6 ] . We assume that every neuron has h k i = 10 randomly selected presynaptic neurons on av - erage so that an arbitrary pair of neurons is connected by a directed edge with probability h k i / ( N − 1 ) ≈ 0 . 1 . Except in Sec . III B 3 , where we investigate eﬀects of heterogeneity , the initial synaptic weight is assumed to be g 0 common for all the synapses . We vary g 0 as a control parameter . 1 . Threshold for frequency synchrony We compare how STDP aﬀects the possibility of entrainment and formation of feed - forward networks when a pacemaker is present and when absent . To this end , we ﬁx a random network and a realization of ω i ( 1 ≤ i ≤ N ) . Without loss of generality , we assume 11 TABLE I : Comparison of the threshold for frequency synchrony g c and the actual mean frequency of the neurons h ˜ ω i in the frequency synchrony . We calculated h ˜ ω i by averaging the instantaneous frequency over all the neurons and over the last ten unit times of the simulation . Pacemaker Present Absent Present g c = 9 . 8 g c = 0 . 72 STDP h ˜ ω i = 8 . 60 h ˜ ω i = 8 . 60 Absent g c = 51 g c = 0 . 93 h ˜ ω i = 8 . 60 h ˜ ω i = 8 . 08 ω 1 ≥ ω 2 ≥ · · · ≥ ω N . For the network with a pacemaker , we make the fastest neuron a pacemaker . By deﬁnition , the rhythm of the pacemaker is not aﬀected by those of the other neurons even though the pacemaker is postsynaptic to approximately h k i neurons . Using the bisection method , we determine the threshold value of g 0 above which all the neurons will synchronize in frequency . The results without dynamical noise ( i . e . , σ = 0 ) are summarized in Table I . When the pacemaker is present from the beginning , STDP drastically reduces the threshold for entrainment [ 11 ] . After entrainment , all the neurons rotate at the inherent frequency of the pacemaker , that is , ω 1 = 8 . 60 . When a pacemaker is initially absent , STDP reduces the threshold for frequency synchrony by 34 % . Facilitation of frequency synchrony in the absence of the initial pacemaker is consistent with the results for the complete graph with N = 3 ( Fig . 2 ) . In this situation , the scenario to frequency synchrony is diﬀerent between the presence and the absence of STDP . With STDP , the fastest oscillator eventually entrains the entire network when the initial synaptic weight is above the threshold , as in the case of the network with a prescribed pacemaker . Without STDP , the fastest oscillator does not entrain the other neurons . The realized mean frequency 8 . 08 is close to the mean inherent frequency of the 100 neurons . This suggests that frequency synchrony in this case is achieved by mutual interaction , rather than by one - way interaction underlying the entrainment by the fastest neuron . Therefore , in networks without predetermined pacemakers , STDP enables emergence of pacemakers and changes the collective dynamics drastically . 12 2 . Network dynamics For σ = 0 , example rastergrams when there is initially no pacemaker and g 0 = 1 . 0 , which is above the threshold value 0 . 72 ( see Table I ) , are shown in Fig . 6 . Figures 6 ( a ) and 6 ( b ) correspond to the initial and ﬁnal stages of a simulation run under STDP , respectively ; frequency synchrony appears as a result of STDP . Figure 6 ( c ) , which is an enlargement of Fig . 6 ( b ) , shows that the fastest neuron entrains the other neurons and that faster neurons tend to ﬁre earlier in a cycle . Figure 7 shows the time course of the degree of synchrony r . Around t = 1 . 2 x 10 7 , r sharply drops , and all the neurons start to oscillate at the same frequency . The eﬀective network deﬁned by the surviving synapses in the ﬁnal state is drawn in Fig . 8 . The neurons are placed so that the horizontal position represents relative spike time in a cycle . With this ordering , the neurons form a feedforward network . In other words , after STDP , if a presynaptic neuron ﬁres later than a postsynaptic neuron in a cycle , this synapse is not present . Partial entrainment occurs when g 0 is slightly or moderately smaller than the threshold value 0 . 72 . Circles and crosses in Fig . 9 represent the actual frequency after transient and the inherent frequency of the each neuron , respectively , when g 0 = 0 . 5 . The neurons with the same actual frequency belong to the same cluster . Each cluster forms a feedforward network emanating from an emergent pacemaker . Figure 9 indicates that the neurons are divided into two clusters and one isolated neuron . Neuron 2 entrains 85 other neurons all of which are slower than neuron 2 , neuron 6 entrains 12 slower neurons , and neuron 1 gets isolated . In this and further numerical simulations we performed , the root of a feedforward subnetwork is always occupied by the fastest neuron in the cluster . Whether two neurons eventually belong to the same cluster is determined by where these neurons are located on the initial random network and by how close their inherent frequencies are . If g 0 is smaller than the value used for Fig . 9 , two neurons have to be closer in ω i to stay connected after STDP . Then the number of clusters increases , and the number of neurons in a cluster decreases on average . 13 3 . Robustness against dynamical noise and heterogeneity To examine the robustness of the numerical results reported in Sec . III B 2 , we perform additional numerical simulations with dynamical noise and random initial synaptic weights . We draw initial g ji ( j , i ) ∈ E randomly and independently from the uniform density on [ 0 , 2 g 0 ] , where g 0 = 1 . 0 . With σ = 0 . 081 , the rastergram and the actual frequency of the neurons after transient are shown in Figs . 10 ( a ) and 10 ( b ) , respectively . With σ = 0 . 081 , the standard deviation of the accumulated noise in a unit time , which is equal to σ , corresponds to 1 % of the phase advancement estimated by the mean inherent frequency of the oscillators , which is equal to 8 . 1 . The rastergram [ Fig . 10 ( a ) ] is indicative of full entrainment . Indeed , all the neurons eventually rotate at the inherent frequency of the fastest neuron [ Fig . 10 ( b ) ] . With σ = 0 . 405 , the neurons are divided into six synchronous clusters of size 31 , 26 , 19 , 12 , 5 , 4 , plus three isolated neurons [ Figs . 10 ( c ) and 10 ( d ) ] . With σ = 0 . 81 , many neurons , particularly faster ones , rotate at their inherent frequencies [ Figs . 10 ( e ) and 10 ( f ) ] . Consequently , there are many clusters of neurons . The frequency synchrony within each cluster is blurred by dynamical noise . In sum , emergence of entrainment via STDP survives some dynamical noise and het - erogeneity in the initial synaptic weights . We have conﬁrmed that , when the entrainment occurs , it is quickly established at around t = 10 6 , and the fastest oscillator is located at the root of the feedforward network , as in Fig . 8 . 4 . Network motifs We investigated the evolution of three - neuron networks in Sec . III A because we expect that these results have something common with evolution of such subnetworks in large networks . The results in Sec . III A predict the following : • Bidirectional edges do not survive STDP , and feedforward networks of size three will be relatively abundant after STDP . Subnetworks abundant in a large network relative to the case of random networks with the same mean degree ( or other order parameters ) are called network motifs [ 22 ] . The hypothesis that feedforward networks are motifs in large neural networks is consistent with the observations in C . elegans neural networks 14 [ 22 ] . • As a result of STDP , a neuron has at most one eﬀective upstream neuron unless multiple upstream neurons are very close in frequency . There are 13 connected network patterns of three nodes . How often each pattern appears in a network with N = 100 , relative to the random network , can be quantiﬁed by the Z score [ 22 ] . The Z score is the normalized number of a pattern in the network , where normalization is given by the mean and the standard deviation of the count of the pattern based on independent samples of the randomized networks . A pattern with a large Z score is a motif of the network with N = 100 . Figure 11 shows the Z score of each pattern before ( circle ) and after ( square ) STDP , calculated by m - ﬁnder [ 23 ] . We set σ = 0 ( i . e . , no dynamical noise ) in this analysis . The error bar shows a range of one standard deviation based on ten simulation runs in each of which we draw a diﬀerent initial random network and a diﬀerent realization of ω i ( 1 ≤ i ≤ 100 ) . Before STDP , the neural network is a directed random graph , so that the Z score for each pattern is around zero , meaning that no pattern is overrepresented or underrepresented signiﬁcantly . After STDP , the feedforward network whose emergence and survival were observed in Sec . III A ( i . e . , pattern 5 in Fig . 11 ) and patterns consistent with this ( i . e . , patterns 1 and 2 ) are overrepresented . These are motifs of our ﬁnal networks . Pattern 4 is also a motif in spite of our negation in Sec . III A because the two upstream neurons in pattern 4 have the same actual frequency . They are generally diﬀerent in inherent frequency but share a more upstream ancestor . As the example network in Fig . 8 shows , existence of multiple paths from a neuron to another due to branching and uniting of edges is compatible with STDP . The other network patterns are not signiﬁcant or underrepresented . These results are further evidence that feedforward networks are formed by STDP in heterogeneous neural networks . IV . DISCUSSION We have shown using heterogeneous coupled phase oscillators that feedforward networks spontaneously emerge via STDP when the initial synaptic weights are above the threshold value . When this is the case , the pacemaker emerges at the root of the feedforward network 15 and entrains the others to oscillate at the inherent frequency of the pacemaker . Although these results have been known for two - neuron networks [ 11 , 13 ] , we have shown them for the cases of three and more neurons and quantiﬁed the phase transitions separating frequency synchrony and asynchrony . The route to frequency synchrony is distinct from a conventional route to frequency synchrony that occurs when mutual , but not one - way , coupling between oscillators is strong enough . Some results obtained in this work are unique to the networks without a prescribed pacemaker . First , the emergent pacemaker is the fastest oscillator neuron according to our extensive numerical simulations . Note that all the oscillators ﬁre at this frequency in the entrained state , whereas they ﬁre at the mean inherent frequency of the oscillators when the frequency synchrony is realized by strong mutual coupling in the absence of STDP . Second , when the initial coupling strength is subthreshold , the neurons are segregated into clusters of feedforward networks . Third , our numerical evidence suggests that entrainment under STDP occurs more easily when a prescribed pacemaker is absent than present . In spite of a wealth of evidence that real neural circuits are full of recurrent connectiv - ity [ 24 ] , feedforward structure may be embedded in recurrent neural networks for reliable transmission of information [ 12 , 25 ] . Feedforward transmission of synchronous volleys in rather homogeneous neural networks as those used in this work serves as a basis of repro - ducible transmission of more complex spatiotemporal spike patterns in more heterogeneous networks . Such patterns may code external input or appear as a result of neural compu - tation [ 7 , 12 ] . Feedforward structure is also a viable mechanism for traveling waves often found in the brain [ 26 ] . Although computational roles of feedforward network structure are not suﬃciently identiﬁed , our results give a support to the biological relevance of feedfor - ward networks . The formation of feedforward networks , which we have shown for oscillatory neurons , is consistent with numerical results for more realistic excitable neurons subject to STDP [ 27 ] . The neurons that directly receive external input may be more excited and ﬁre at a higher rate compared to other parts of a neural circuit . Our results suggest that such a neuron or an ensemble of neurons is capable of recruiting other neurons into entrainment and creating feedforward structure . We assumed the additive STDP with the nearest - neighbor rule in which the dependence of the amount of plasticity on the current synaptic weight and the eﬀects of distant presynaptic and postsynaptic spike pairs , triplets , and so on , are neglected . Generally speaking , evolution 16 of synaptic weights is aﬀected by the implementation of the STDP rule [ 18 ] . However , we believe that our results are robust in the variation of the STDP rule as far as it respects the enhancement of causal relationships between presynaptic and postsynaptic pairs of neurons . Our preliminary numerical data with excitable neuron models suggest that the results are similar between the multiplicative rule [ 18 ] and the additive rule [ Kato and Ikeguchi ( private communication ) ] . Recent reports claim the relevance of acausal spike pairs in the presence of synaptic delay [ 10 , 28 ] . This and other factors , such as diﬀerent time scales of LTP and LTD [ 27 ] , may let bidirectional synapses survive as observed in in vitro experiments [ 29 ] . Incorporating these factors is an important future problem . We have ignored inhibitory neurons for two reasons . First , our main goal is to identify phase transitions regarding synchrony with a simple model . Second , speciﬁc rules of STDP are not established for inhibitory neurons , albeit some pioneering results [ 30 ] . Taking in - hibitory neurons into account , preferably in the subthreshold regime , warrants for future work . Acknowledgments We thank Hideyuki Cˆateau for valuable discussions . N .

One pacemaker neuron is initially present [ ( a ) and ( c ) ] or absent [ ( b ) and ( d ) ] . We run numerical simulations 20 times for each pair of parameter values . We add the red element of the RGB color scheme by the maximum amount divided by 20 when g 12 survives in a simulation run . Similarly , the green is added when g 23 survives , and the blue is added when all the neurons get disconnected . Yellow regions appear when both g 12 and g 23 survive , since the combination of red and green is yellow . In this case , it turns out that g 13 also survives . We veriﬁed that no other connectivity , such as survival of g 13 without survival of g 12 or g 23 , and survival of g 21 , g 31 , or g 32 , appears except at points near phase transitions and resonance . Near phase transitions , we exclude such exceptional runs from the statistics . In the resonance regions ( e . g . , ∆ ω ≈ 2 . 7 and g 0 ≈ 0 . 4 ) , the three neurons may remain connected .
