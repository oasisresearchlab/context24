The CA plays crucial roles in regulating ciliary motility . Defects in CA assembly or function usually result in motility - impaired or paralyzed cilia , which in humans causes disease . Despite their importance , the protein composition and functions of most CA projections remain largely unknown . Here , we combined genetic approaches and quantitative proteomics with cryo - electron tomography and subtomogram averaging to compare the CA of wild - type Chlamydomonas with those of two CA mutants . Our results show that two conserved proteins , FAP42 and FAP246 , are localized to the L - shaped C1b projection of the CA . We also identified another novel CA candidate protein , FAP413 , which interacts with both FAP42 and FAP246 . FAP42 is a large protein that forms the peripheral ‘beam’ of the C1b projection , and the FAP246 - FAP413 subcomplex serves as the ‘bracket’ between the beam ( FAP42 ) and the C1b ‘pillar’ that attaches the projection to the C1 microtubule . The FAP246 - FAP413 - FAP42 complex is essential for stable assembly of both the C1b and C1f projections , and loss of any of these proteins leads to ciliary motility defects . Our results provide insight into the subunit organization and 3D structure of the C1b projection , suggesting that the FAP246 - FAP413 - FAP42 subcomplex is part of a large interconnected CA - network that provides mechanical support and may play a role in mechano - signaling between the CA and radial spokes to regulate dynein activity and ciliary beating . 4 Introduction Cilia and flagella ( terms here used interchangeably ) are highly conserved organelles in eukaryotes , where they play a variety of roles in cells , including motility , generating fluid flow , and sensing extracellular signals . A wide range of human diseases , collectively known as ciliopathies , are associated with cilia dysfunction , leading to symptoms including chronic respiratory infections , laterality abnormalities , and infertility ( Afzelius , 2004 ; Braun and Hildebrandt , 2017 ; Brown and Witman , 2014 ) . The core component of the motile cilium is the ‘9 + 2’ axoneme , which consists of nine outer doublet microtubules ( DMTs ) and a central apparatus ( CA ) composed of two singlet microtubules and associated projections . Each DMT consists of many copies of 96 - nm - long units that repeat along the axoneme ; each repeat includes major substructures such as outer and inner dynein arms ( ODAs and IDAs ) , radial spokes ( RSs ) , and nexin - dynein regulatory complexes ( N - DRCs ) ( Fig . 1A ) . Together with the CA , these substructures produce and regulate the cilium’s motility , and distinguish motile cilia from non - motile cilia such as primary cilia ( Dymek and Smith , 2007 ; Gui et al . , 2019 ; Kikkawa , 2013 ; Lin and Nicastro , 2018 ; Loreng and Smith , 2017 ; Nicastro et al . , 2006 ; Roberts et al . , 2013 ; Viswanadha et al . , 2017 ) . The CA is the largest ciliary regulatory complex . The two singlet microtubules , termed C1 and C2 , are both canonical 13 - protofilament microtubules ; however , they differ in stability and associated projections . Recent cryo - electron tomography ( cryo - ET ) studies of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii axoneme have identified at least 11 protein projections with a total molecular mass of > 14 MD that form 16 - or 32 - nm repeating units along the C1 and C2 microtubules ( Carbajal - Gonzalez et al . , 2013 ) . Among the 11 projections , six ( C1a - f ) are associated with the C1 microtubule and five ( C2a - e ) with the C2 microtubule ( Fig . 1B and Movie S1 ) . The projections consist of many proteins that connect the C1 and C2 microtubules and / or extend toward the RS heads . Presumably , the CA regulates ciliary motility through the CA → RS → N - DRC → IDA signaling pathway ( Wirschell , 2009 ) ; however , the molecular details are still elusive . The CA is essential for normal ciliary motility from Chlamydomonas to mammals , and mutations affecting the CA often lead to impaired or paralyzed cilia ( Dutcher et al . , 1984 ; Smith and Lefebvre , 1996 ; Smith and Yang , 2004 ; Witman et al . , 1978 ) . In mice and 5 humans , defects in CA proteins are associated with the ciliopathy primary ciliary dyskinesia ( PCD ) ( Loreng and Smith , 2017 ; Poprzeczko et al . , 2019 ; Teves et al . , 2016 ) . For instance , defects in the C1d proteins FAP221 ( also known as Pcdp1 ) or FAP54 lead to typical PCD symptoms in mice , including accumulation of mucus in the lungs , male infertility , and hydrocephalus ( Lee et al . , 2008 ; McKenzie et al . , 2015 ) . In humans , mutations in the CA protein PF20 ( human Spag16L ) can cause male infertility , and recessive mutations in the C2b protein Hydin cause PCD ( Olbrich et al . , 2012 ; Zhang et al . , 2007 ) . Therefore , it is important to establish a detailed understanding of CA structures and the mechanisms by which the CA regulates ciliary motility . Despite the importance of the CA for ciliary motility , the specific locations of most of its proteins remain unknown , which makes CA the least understood axonemal structure to date . Several recent proteomic and structural studies have shed light on the protein composition and 3D - structure of the CA ( Carbajal - Gonzalez et al . , 2013 ; Dai et al . , 2020 ; Fu et al . , 2019 ; Zhao et al . , 2019 ) . For example , proteomic comparisons of CAs from mutant and wild - type ( WT ) Chlamydomonas identified 37 and 44 new candidate CA proteins , respectively ( Dai et al . , 2020 ; Zhao et al . , 2019 ) , of which many were assigned to the C1 or C2 microtubule and some to specific projections ( Fig . 1B ) . Our recent cryo - ET study visualized the CA structure with up to 2 . 3 nm resolution and provided details about the molecular architecture of the PF16 - dependent C1a - e - c supercomplex that contains at least 16 proteins ( Fu et al . , 2019 ) . However , due to the high connectivity within and between CA projections , the assignment of CA proteins to certain projections based on biochemical and mass spectrometry ( MS ) data can lead to ambiguous or even erroneous conclusions . For instance , the two CA proteins FAP76 and FAP81 were unambiguously shown to be components of the C1a - e - c supercomplex by cryo - ET studies ( Fu et al . , 2019 ) , but were mistakenly assigned to the C1d projection in a proteomic study ( Dai et al . , 2019 ) . Given this caveat , it is important to complement MS studies with structural studies , e . g . using cryo - ET of mutants or tagged candidate proteins , to localize specific subunits within the CA . The C1b projection is one of the largest and most complex CA projections , which appears to have a particularly strong affinity for RS heads ( Nakazawa et al . , 2014 ) . Pioneering studies on this projection in Chlamydomonas showed that it physically interacts with the C2b 6 projection of the C2 microtubule , and that the cpc1 mutant , which swims slowly due to reduced flagellar beat frequency , lacks the entire C1b projection as assessed by conventional EM , suggesting that the C1b projection has a role in the control of beat frequency ( Mitchell and Sale , 1999 ) . Biochemical analyses found that the cpc1 axonemes lacked three proteins that co - sedimented as part of a larger complex , termed the CPC1 complex , containing at least six proteins ( Mitchell and Sale , 1999 ) . Further analysis identified five of these proteins as CPC1 , FAP42 , FAP69 , enolase and HSP70A ( Fig . 1B ) ( Mitchell et al . , 2005 ) . The first cryo - ET study of the CA ( Carbajal - Gonzalez et al . , 2013 ) revealed that the C1b projection is more architecturally complex than previously known , and its estimated mass is nearly 2 MDa , i . e . twice the sum of the masses of the known C1b subunits ( 883 kDa ) . Cryo - ET also showed that C1b interacts with a previously undescribed projection , C1f , that is located between the C1b and C1d projections ( Carbajal - Gonzalez et al . , 2013 ) . In our previous analyses of the CA proteome , we identified two novel CA candidate proteins , FAP39 and FAP246 , that were assigned to the C1 microtubule and co - immunoprecipitated with known C1b proteins , indicating that they likely are C1b or C1f proteins . Axonemes of the mutant fap246 - 1 had greatly reduced amounts of both FAP246 and another candidate CA protein , FAP413 ( Zhao et al . , 2019 ) . However , none of these proteins have been localized precisely within the C1b or C1f projections . Here , we integrated genetic and quantitative proteomic approaches with cryo - ET and subtomogram averaging to compare CAs from mutants for two highly conserved and predicted C1b proteins , FAP42 and FAP246 , with the WT CA . The Chlamydomonas fap42 and fap246 mutants showed impaired motility compared to WT , indicating their importance in the regulation of ciliary beating . Our data allowed localization of FAP42 , FAP246 and FAP413 within the C1b projection , as well as refined predictions for the locations of FAP39 and six additional CA proteins . Classification analyses of the CA structures of the mutants revealed that the FAP246 - FAP413 - FAP42 subcomplex is critical for the stability of neighboring structures and may play a role in mechano - signaling from the CA to the RS and dyneins to regulate ciliary beating . 7 Results Chlamydomonas fap246 and fap42 mutants have motility defects FAP246 is a 120 - kDa protein that is predicted to contain a highly conserved leucine - rich repeat ( LRR ) domain , a papain - like domain , and an EF - hand domain ( Fig . S1A ) . We first reexamined the fap246 mutant strain that was partially characterized in our previous study ( Zhao et al . , 2019 ) . Nearly all fap246 cells were motile , but they swam ~ 30 % slower than WT cells ( Fig . 1C ) , a reduction in swimming velocity slightly greater than we previously reported ( possibly reflecting culture in liquid TAP medium here vs . modified M medium ) and similar to that of the cpc1 mutant ( Mitchell and Sale , 1999 ) . Compared to WT , many fap246 mutant cells also had an altered swimming pattern in which cells frequently changed swimming direction , resulting in highly curved and spiraling swimming paths ( c . f . Fig . 1D and E ) . Therefore , FAP246 is likely to have an important role in the control of flagellar motility . FAP42 is a conserved ~ 300 - kDa protein that is predicted to have a papain - like domain and four guanylate kinase domains ( Fig . S1C ) . We obtained a fap42 mutant strain ( CLiP ID : LMJ . RY0402 . 205930 ) from the CLiP library ( Li et al . , 2016 ) and , using PCR , confirmed insertion of the cassette into the FAP42 gene in a genetically homogenous clone ( Fig . S1F ) . Compared to WT cells , fap42 mutant cells swam ~ 37 % slower ( Fig . 1C ) . Cells of fap42 swam slightly slower than fap246 cells , but their swimming paths were less curved ( Fig . 1F ) . The results suggest that FAP42 also is important for the regulation of flagellar motility . Proteomics studies of fap246 and fap42 axonemes We used quantitative MS to compare the axonemal proteomes of WT , fap42 and fap24 6 axonemes . Label - free quantitation of proteins across samples was performed using SINQ normalized spectral index Software ( Trudgian et al . , 2011 ) ( Table 1 ) . We included the recently identified novel candidate CA proteins ( Dai et al . , 2020 ; Zhao et al . , 2019 ) in our Chlamydomonas reinhardtii protein database during the peptide search ( Table S1 ) . The MS / MS results confirmed that the protein level of FAP246 is significantly reduced in the fap246 axoneme compared to WT ( fap246 / WT ratio = 0 . 05 ) . In the fap246 axoneme , MS detected 8 8 exclusive unique FAP246 peptides compared with 46 in the WT samples ( Table 1 ) . The 8 exclusive unique FAP246 peptides that were identified originated from the N - terminus of the protein , suggesting that a small amount of C - terminally truncated FAP246 was assembled into the fap246 axonemes ( Table S2 ) . The only other protein that was significantly reduced in the fap246 axoneme was FAP413 ( fap246 / WT ratio = 0 . 02 ) . Only 2 exclusive unique FAP413 peptides were detected in the fap246 axoneme compared with 44 in that of WT ( Table 1 and S2 ) , indicating that very little FAP413 is assembled into fap246 axonemes . FAP413 is a 210 - kDa protein that is predicted to have a large WD40 - repeat domain at the C - terminus with at least 11 WD40 repeats ( Fig . S1E ) . The results indicate that FAP246 and FAP413 are likely in the same CA substructure , and that FAP413 is dependent on FAP246 for its assembly into the axoneme . The MS analyses of fap42 axonemes revealed that the protein level of FAP42 is significantly reduced in the mutant axoneme compared to WT ( fap42 / WT ratio = 0 . 04 ) ( Table 1 ) . In the fap42 axoneme , MS detected 29 exclusive unique FAP42 peptides compared with 135 exclusive unique peptides in the WT sample ( Table 1 ) . These peptides originated from throughout the FAP42 sequence ( Table S3 ) , suggesting that a small amount of full - length FAP42 is assembled into the fap42 mutant axoneme . The only other protein that was significantly reduced in the fap42 axoneme was FAP413 ( fap42 / WT ratio = 0 . 03 ) . 10 exclusive unique FAP413 peptides were detected in the MS analyses of fap42 axonemes compared with 44 in that of WT ( Table 1 and S3 ) , indicating that very little FAP413 is assembled into the mutant axoneme . The results suggest that FAP413 and FAP42 assemble into the same complex , and that FAP42 is essential for proper assembly of FAP413 into the axoneme . The level of FAP246 in fap42 axonemes was only slightly decreased ( fap42 / WT ratio = 0 . 75 ) ( Table 1 ) . The fact that FAP413 was significantly decreased in the MS analyses of both fap42 and fap246 axonemes suggests that it interacts with both FAP42 and FAP246 . Several other proteins have been predicted to be in the C1b projection , i . e . CPC1 , FAP39 , FAP69 , the chaperone protein HSP70A , the glycolytic enzyme enolase , and , with less confidence , FAP174 and FAP380 ( Fig . 1B ) ( Mitchell et al . , 2005 ; Zhang and Mitchell , 2004 ; Zhao et al . , 2019 ) . Our MS / MS analyses showed that the protein level for none of these proteins was significantly affected in fap246 axonemes . In the MS / MS analyses of fap42 axonemes , the protein levels of FAP69 and CPC1 were not affected , but the levels of HSP70A , enolase , FAP39 , 9 and FAP380 were reduced to 40 % , 64 % , 33 % and 36 % of WT level , respectively ( Table 1 and S1 ) . HSP70A and enolase are known to locate not only to the C1b projection but elsewhere in the axoneme ( Mitchell et al . , 2005 ; Zhao et al . , 2019 ) , so that the amounts remaining in fap42 axonemes could represent the non - C1b pool of these proteins . None of the known proteins in the C1 - a - e - c supercomplex or C1d projection were significantly affected ( Table 1 and S1 ) . FAP246 is localized to the C1b projection and forms a complex with FAP413 We next carried out cryo - ET and subtomogram averaging to investigate the CA structure of fap246 and compare it with the WT CA . Our subtomogram averages revealed the CA structures of WT and fap246 axonemes with 2 . 5 - nm and 2 . 2 - nm resolution , respectively ( Fourier shell correlation 0 . 5 criterion ) ( Fig . S1G ) , similar to what we reported previously ( Fu et al . , 2019 ) . In WT , C1b is one of the largest CA projections ( ~ 1 . 3 MDa ) that has a roughly triangular shape in cross - sectional view . We named the three sides of the triangle : the 17 nm long “pillar” that projects from C1 protofilament # 9 outwards , in the periphery a long perpendicular “beam” , and the “bracket” that connects diagonally between pillar and beam ( Fig . 2A - D and the inset ) . The bracket density consists of two roughly globular domains of which the slightly more proximal - central one ( the “inner bracket” ) connects to the pillar , and the more distal - peripheral one ( the “outer bracket” ) links to the beam ( Fig . 2 B and D ) . The beam structure , but not the bracket , extends longitudinally and connects with the beam structures of the neighboring repeats along the axoneme length , and also forms a small connection with the C2b projection ( Movie S1 ) . All C1b structures have a 16 nm periodicity and form multiple connections to neighboring CA structures . In fap246 , the averaged CA repeats lacked the entire bracket density of the C1b projection , confirming that FAP246 is a C1b protein ( Figs . 2E - H ; S2 ) . The molecular weight ( MW ) of the FAP246 - dependent density was estimated to be ~ 350 kDa based on the volume difference between the mutant and WT CA average ( for details see Methods ) . This suggested that the bracket either contains three copies of FAP246 ( 120 kDa ) or additional C1b subunit ( s ) . The only protein besides FAP246 that was significantly reduced in the MS analyses of fap246 axonemes was FAP413 ( 210 kDa ) . The MWs of the inner and outer bracket ( Fig . 2B and D , ib 10 and ob ) domains were estimated to be 150 kDa and 180 kDa in WT , respectively . This suggested that FAP246 and FAP413 form a subcomplex , with FAP246 localizing to the inner and FAP413 to the slightly larger outer bracket domain , and that the stable assembly of FAP413 into axonemes required FAP246 . Previously , FAP413 was predicted to be a C1 protein , but could not be assigned to a specific projection ( Zhao et al . , 2019 ) . Compared to the WT CA , the density of both the pillar and the beam appeared to be weakened and blurred in the fap246 CA structure ( Fig . 2I - L ) . This blurring suggests either partial reduction of the structures ( i . e . not all repeats contain them ) or positional flexibility of them . Therefore , we applied automatic image classification analyses with a mask that focused on the blurred densities ( Heumann et al . , 2011 ) . Classification of the WT CA structure in this region revealed one structurally homogenous class . In contrast , the C1b structure of fap246 was separated into four structurally different classes ( Fig . 2M - P , Movie S2 ) : in 45 % the pillar was positioned in the center like in WT ( Fig . 2N , class 2 ) , in 35 % the pillar tilted towards the axoneme base ( Fig . 2M , class 1 ) , in 13 % the pillar tilted towards the axoneme tip ( Fig . 2O , class 3 ) , and in 7 % of the repeats the distal half of the pillar was missing ( Fig . 2P , class 4 ) . The 3D classification analyses on the blurred beam density also revealed four classes with comparable distribution as the pillar classes , which is consistent with the pillar and beam forming a unit that moves together ( Fig . 2Q - T ) . Specifically , in 43 % the beam density was positioned in the center like in WT ( Fig . 2R , class 2 ) , in 25 % the beam density tilted towards the axoneme base ( Fig . 2Q , class 1 ) , in 26 % the beam tilted towards the axoneme base ( Fig . 2S , class 3 ) , and in 6 % of the repeats the beam density was missing ( Fig . 2T , class 4 ) . These results showed both positional flexibility and a small reduction of the pillar and beam densities in fap246 , strongly suggesting that the FAP246 - FAP413 bracket plays a role in stabilizing the neighboring C1b pillar and beam . FAP42 forms the beam of the C1b projection FAP42 was one of the 5 originally identified C1b proteins in the CPC1 complex ( Mitchell et al . , 2005 ) , but so far it has not been localized within the C1b structure . Using cryo - ET and subtomogram averaging , we visualized the fap42 CA with 2 . 5 nm resolution ( FSC 0 . 5 criterion ) ( Fig . S1G ) . Compared to the WT CA , the averaged fap42 CA repeats lacked the entire C1b beam 11 and the outer bracket density that usually connects to the beam ( Figs . 3 and S2 ) . The mass of the entire FAP42 - dependent density was estimated to be ~ 480 kDa , i . e . ~ 300 kDa for the beam and ~ 180 kDa for the outer bracket structure . The only two proteins that were almost completely reduced in the MS analyses of fap42 axonemes were FAP42 and FAP413 ( Table 1 ) . This suggests that FAP42 and FAP413 form a subcomplex , with FAP42 ( 260 kDa ) forming ( most of ) the beam structure , and FAP413 localizing to the outer bracket domain , in good agreement with our results for the fap246 mutant . Similar to FAP246 , FAP42 is also required for stable assembly of FAP413 into the CA . The FAP42 - FAP413 subcomplex is connected to several neighboring densities , i . e . FAP413 ( outer bracket ) connects to FAP246 ( inner bracket ) , while FAP42 ( the beam ) connects with the peripheral tip of the C1b pillar , with the distal tips of the beams in the neighboring repeats , and with apposing structures of the C2b projection ( Fig . 3A , D and E ) . Our MS analyses showed that the protein level of FAP413 is significantly reduced in both fap42 and fap246 axonemes , which is consistent with it being the shared missing density in the averaged CA repeats of fap42 and fap246 axonemes ( Fig . 2 and 3 , Table 1 ) . Thus our results revealed that FAP42 forms most of the C1b beam , FAP413 the outer bracket domain and FAP246 the inner bracket domain . Compared to the WT CA , several structures that interact with the FAP42 - dependent complex were weakened or blurred in fap42 ( Fig . 4A - H and A’ ) , including the FAP246 inner bracket ( compare Fig . 4A , B with 4E and F , red arrowheads ) , the peripheral part of the C1b pillar ( compare Fig . 4A , C with E and G , blue arrowheads ) , and the C1f projection that connects to the pillar structure ( compare Fig . 4A , D and E and H , green arrowheads ) . We applied automatic 3D image classification analyses with masks focusing on the above weakened C1b and C1f densities ( Heumann et al . , 2011 ) . In all cases , the classification analyses of WT CA repeats showed one structurally homogenous class . In contrast , for the two weakened C1b densities ( FAP246 and the peripheral part of the C1b pillar ) , two distinct classes were identified for fap42 : in class 1 ( 54 % ) both densities were present with full occupancy like in WT ( Fig . 4I - K ) , whereas they were missing in the class 2 ( 46 % ) ( Fig . 4L - N ) . For the C1f projection , three classes were identified for fap42 : in class 1 ( 50 % ) the C1f density connecting with the C1b pillar was missing ( Fig . 4O and P ) , in classes 2 and 3 ( 26 and 24 % ) the same C1f density was present with full occupancy , but the C1f structures showed positional flexibility ( Movie S3 ) , i . e . in class 2 it was tilted proximal 12 along the C1 microtubule ( Fig . 4Q and R ) compared to the WT - like class 3 ( Fig . 4S and T ) . The 3D classification analyses revealed that loss of the FAP42 - FAP413 subcomplex resulted in both reduced occupancy and positional flexibility of the neighboring C1b pillar and C1f projection . Therefore , FAP42 is essential for the stable assembly and positioning of neighboring structures in the C1b and C1f projections . C1b pillar interacts with several structures in the C1b and C1f projections Our cryo - ET results showed that the C1b “pillar” is highly connected with neighboring CA structures through six interfaces ( Fig . 2A and C ; and Fig . 5 , dark blue ) . We observed two connections from the pillar within the C1b projection , i . e . to the FAP42 beam ( Fig . 5 , green ) , and to the FAP246 inner bracket domain ( Fig . 5D , magenta colored density ) . Additional interfaces of the C1b pillar are : the attachment site to protofilament 9 of the C1 - microtubule , two connections with the C1f projection ( Fig . 5D , cyan ) , and a connection to part of the CA bridge density that links the C1 and C2 microtubules ( Fig . 5D , gray ) . The protein composition of the pillar is unknown and cannot be precisely dissected using the CA mutants studied here , because the pillar structure remained mostly present in both mutants . However , previous studies predicted five additional C1b proteins , i . e . CPC1 ( 205 kDa ) , FAP69 ( 114 kDa ) , enolase ( 51 kDa ) , HSP70A ( 71 kDa ) , FAP39 ( 127 kDa ) ( Mitchell et al . , 2005 ; Zhao et al . , 2019 ) , that we did not find in the C1b beam and bracket structures . Therefore , the C1b pillar likely contains ( most of ) these proteins , which in sum would be slightly larger ( ~ 550 kDa ) than the estimated total molecular weight of ~ 450 kDa for the pillar based on the cryo - ET averages . 13 Discussion Protein composition and structural organization of the C1b projection The CA is highly conserved and plays essential roles in regulating ciliary beating , likely through the [ CA → RS → IDA & N - DRC → dyneins ] signaling pathway ( Wirschell , 2009 ) . Single protein mutations often cause CA defects that result in impaired or paralyzed cilia , and are associated with various ciliopathies ( Loreng and Smith , 2017 ; Poprzeczko et al . , 2019 ; Teves et al . , 2016 ) . Our previous CA study combined structural and biochemical data , and revealed a 2 MDa C1 - a - e - c supercomplex ( Fu et al . , 2019 ) . We identified several key proteins in the C1a - e - c supercomplex , including PF16 , FAP76 , FAP81 , FAP92 , and FAP216 , and precisely localized them by cryo - ET ( Fu et al . , 2019 ) . Our study also highlighted that the structural data were often critical for guiding the interpretation of biochemical data ; e . g . FAP81 was found to immunoprecipitate with C1a and C1e proteins , but it could not be definitively assigned to either of these projections ( Zhao et al . , 2019 ) ; in contrast to these biochemical results though , our cryo - ET study revealed that FAP81 localized to the C1c projection within the interconnected C1 - a - e - c supercomplex ( Fu et al . , 2019 ) . For most of the remaining CA projections , subunits have so far only been characterized biochemically , e . g . for the C1d projection ( FAP46 , FAP54 , FAP74 , FAP221 , and FAP297 ) , and the C2 projections ( Brown et al . , 2012 ; DiPetrillo and Smith , 2010 ; DiPetrillo and Smith , 2011 ; Lechtreck and Witman , 2007 ; Zhao et al . , 2019 ) . The protein composition of the C1b projection has previously been predicted based on co - sedimentation in sucrose gradients , CA mutant proteomics and coimmunoprecipitation . The C1b candidate proteins included CPC1 , FAP39 , FAP42 , FAP69 , FAP246 , the chaperone protein HSP70A , the glycolytic enzyme enolase , and - with less confidence – FAP174 and FAP380 ( Dai et al . , 2020 ; Mitchell et al . , 2005 ; Zhang and Mitchell , 2004 ; Zhao et al . , 2019 ) . In the present study , we compared axonemes of WT and two C1b mutants , fap42 and fap246 , using a combination of quantitative proteomics and cryo - ET imaging . We localized FAP42 and FAP246 within the C1b projection , and identified and localized a new C1b subunit , FAP413 ; previously , FAP413 was thought to associate with the C1 microtubule , but could not be assigned to a specific CA projection ( Zhao et al . , 2019 ) . Finally , we described the structural organization of the subcomplex formed by these 3 subunits ( Fig . 5 and Movie S4 ) . 14 The C1b projection can be divided into three major structural parts ( Fig . 5 and Movie S4 ) : 1 ) FAP42 ( Fig . 5 , green ) forms repeating beams at the interface between the CA and RS heads ; 2 ) the pillar ( Fig . 5 , dark blue ) attaches the C1b protection to protofilament 9 of the C1 microtubule and is a major interaction hub with five additional interfaces with neighboring CA structures , including the C1f projection and C1 - C2 bridge ; and 3 ) FAP413 and FAP246 ( Fig . 5 , yellow and magenta , Movie S4 ) form a bracket between the pillar and beam ; specifically , FAP413 forms the outer C1b bracket density that interacts with the beam , and FAP246 forms the inner bracket density that interacts with the pillar . We named the FAP246 - FAP413 complex “bracket” because the C1b projection architecture resembles a pillar - beam construction for roofs , and our 3D - classification analyses revealed that disruption of the bracket structure in both fap246 and fap42 mutants resulted in structural destabilization ( positional flexibility and reduction ) of remaining C1b and C1f structures . All these structures have a 16 - nm periodicity along the C1 - microtuble , which is the predominant CA periodicity . A few other CA structures , such as features in the C1d projection , repeat with 32 nm instead of 16 nm periodicity ( Carbajal - Gonzalez et al . , 2013 ) . A previous study showed that FAP42 co - sediments with CPC1 ( 205 kDa ) , FAP69 ( 114 kDa ) , enolase ( 51 kDa ) and HSP70A ( 71 kDa ) in sucrose gradients ( Mitchell et al . , 2005 ) and that FAP39 co - immunoprecipiated with FAP246 - HA ( Zhao et al . , 2019 ) . These five previously identified C1b proteins were not completely missing in the MS of the here studied mutants of the C1b beam - bracket ( FAP246 - FAP413 - FAP42 ) subcomplex ( Table 1 ) , suggesting that these proteins might instead form the C1b pillar and part of the C1f projection . This would be consistent with our size estimation for the pillar of ~ 450 kDa . Previous classical electron microscopy studies observed that the entire C1b projection was missing from Chlamydomonas cpc1 mutant flagella ( Mitchell and Sale , 1999 ; Zhang and Mitchell , 2004 ) . Therefore , CPC1 likely is located at the base of the C1b pillar and serves as a scaffold / docking protein that stabilizes the attachment of the C1b projection to the C1 microtubule , possibly by interacting also on two sides with the C1f projection and the C1 - C2 bridge , respectively ( Fig . 5 ) . In contrast to CPC1 and FAP69 that were completely unaffected in our MS / MS analyses of fap42 and fap 246 axonemes , enolase , HSP70A , and FAP39 were reduced to between 33 - 64 % of WT level in fap42 and between 79 - 85 % in fap 246 ( Table 1 ) . This suggests that the latter proteins localize 15 to the peripheral half of the C1b pillar ( Fig . 5 ) that connects to FAP42 and FAP246 , and was structurally missing in ~ 46 % of the fap42 repeats ( Fig . 4I - N , class 2 ) and in 7 % of the fap 246 repeats ( Fig . 2 , class 4 ) . The estimated size of the missing pillar region is ~ 450 kDa , slightly smaller than the sum of the five proteins ( CPC1 , FAP39 , FAP69 , HSP70 , enolase ) predicted to be pillar proteins . However , the borders between the C1b pillar and C1f projection were assigned based on previous classical EM studies of the cpc1 mutant ( Carbajal - Gonzalez et al . , 2013 ) . Compared to cryo - ET , classical EM images have lower resolution , so that part of the C1f projection could actually belong to the C1b projection ( Fig . 5 ) , which would be consistent with the finding that part of the C1f projection also showed missing density in ~ 50 % of the repeats , similar to the peripheral pillar density . To date , no C1f proteins have been identified . Our present proteomic analyses of fap42 axonemes revealed that another candidate CA protein , FAP380 ( 20 kDa ) ( Zhao et al . , 2019 ) , was reduced to 36 % of WT level ( Table S1 ) . Given the partial loss of the C1b pillar and C1f projection of fap42 , FAP380 may be a subunit of the C1b pillar or C1f projection . None of the known proteins of the C1 - a - e - c supercomplex or the C1d projection were decreased significantly in the C1b mutants studied here ( Table 1 ) . The candidate CA protein FAP174 ( 10 kDa ) , which was previously assigned to C2 ( Rao et al . , 2016 ) , was specifically enriched in one of the FAP246 - HA coimmunoprecipitation replicates in Zhao et al . ; therefore , FAP174 was predicted to be - with less confidence – either a C1b or C2b protein ( Zhao et al . , 2019 ) . The C2b projection was not structurally affected in either of the mutants studied here , and FAP174 was not reduced in our MS of the mutants . Therefore , our results would be more consistent with FAP174 being a C2b , rather than a C1b / f , subunit ( Fig . 5 ) . C1b proteins may be involved in nucleotide cycles FAP246 is a conserved protein that contains a highly conserved LRR domain and guanylate kinase domain ( Fig . S1A ) . The mammalian homolog of FAP246 , LRGUK - 1 ( NP _ 653249 ) ( Fig . S1B ) , was previously localized to the acrosome - acroplaxoneme - manchette - tail network in mouse sperm ( Liu et al . , 2015 ) . FAP42 is a conserved protein that contains four guanylate kinase 16 domains ( Fig . S1C ) . The human homolog of FAP42 , guanylate kinase isoform b ( GUK1 ; NP _ 000849 . 1 ) ( Fig . S1D ) , catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to guanosine monophosphate ( GMP ) to eventually form guanosine diphosphate ( GDP ) , and is a potential target for cancer chemotherapy ( Khan et al . , 2019 ) . Guanylate kinase activity – possibly provided by both FAP42 and FAP246 - has not been studied in cilia , but maintenance of flagellar GTP concentrations may be important for both guanylate cyclase activity and tubulin polymerization ( Mitchell et al . , 2005 ) . CPC1 contains an adenylate kinase domain , indicating that it might be involved in maintaining stable intraciliary ATP levels during ciliary beating ( Zhang and Mitchell , 2004 ) . All studied C1b mutants , i . e . the previously described cpc1 ( Zhang and Mitchell , 2004 ) and the here characterized fap246 and fap42 ( Fig . 1 ) , showed similarly mild motility defects with ciliary beat frequency reduced to 60 - 70 % that of WT , in contrast to mutations of some other CA proteins ( e . g . PF16 and FAP216 from the C1a - e - c supercomplex , and FAP46 and FAP74 from the C1d projection ) that cause severely impaired motility or paralyzed cilia ( Brown et al . , 2012 ; Dutcher et al . , 1984 ; Fu et al . , 2019 ; Smith and Lefebvre , 1996 ) . This likely means that the C1b projection , including the FAP246 - FAP413 - FAP42 subcomplex , is not essential for transmission of the signal that regulates dynein activity and thus ciliary beating . However , fap246 cells , but not fap42 cells , frequently changed swimming direction , resulting in curving and even spiraling swimming paths ( Fig . 1E ) . This is typically observed when the two Chlamydomonas cilia beat asynchronously , suggesting that FAP246 may play some role in coordinating and / or timing the oscillatory switching of dynein activity to maintain synchrony between the two beating cilia ( Polin et al . , 2009 ) . FAP413 has no close homologs in holozoans ( Zhao et al . , 2020 ) . However , secondary structure prediction suggests that it has a large WD40 - repeat domain at the C - terminus with at least 11 WD40 repeats ( Fig . S1E ) . WD40 - repeat proteins are a large family found in all eukaryotes and are implicated in a variety of functions ranging from signal transduction and transcription regulation to cell - cycle control and apoptosis . WD40 - repeat motifs are thought to act as a site for protein - protein interaction , and proteins containing WD40 repeats are known to serve as platforms for the assembly of protein complexes ( Jain and Pandey , 2018 ) . Mutations of WD40 - repeat proteins are associated with various human diseases including ciliopathies ( Kim 17 and Kim , 2020 ) . Our previous proteomic study predicted that FAP413 is associated with the C1 microtubule but could not unambiguously assign it to one of the projections , because it was significantly decreased in both fap246 and fap76 axonemes ( Zhao et al . , 2019 ) . FAP76 is a C1a protein and part of the C1a - e - c supercomplex ( Fu et al . , 2019 ) . Therefore , it is possible that another copy of FAP413 is present in the C1a - e - c supercomplex , serving as a binding platform like many WD40 - repeat proteins that are known to be promiscuous interactors ( Stirnimann et al . , 2010 ) . The FAP246 - FAP413 - FAP42 subcomplex is part of a large interconnected CA network A recurring feature of CA projections and subunits is their high connectivity within the projection and with neighboring CA structures , resulting in a massive CA protein network . For example , we previously reported that the C1a - e - c supercomplex forms multiple connections within the complex and at least three connections with the neighboring C1d projection ( Fu et al . , 2019 ) , and here we showed that the C1b projection has four internal connections and six connections with neighboring structures , including with C1f and the C1 - C2 bridge ( Fig . 5 ) . 3D - classification analyses revealed that loss of any protein of the FAP246 - FAP413 - FAP42 subcomplex caused positional flexibility and / or partial reduction of the neighboring C1b pillar structure and C1f projection . The latter is not in direct contact with the beam - bracket ( FAP246 - FAP413 - FAP42 ) subcomplex , and thus is likely affected through its connections with the C1b pillar , suggesting a C1b - f supercomplex . Taken together with previous findings that the C1f projection also interacts with the C1d projection , because mutation of the C1d protein FAP74 in fap7 4 led to loss of both the C1d projection and the C1f projection ( previously termed “sheath” in conventional transmission electron microscope studies ) ( Brown et al . , 2012 ) , and that the C1d projection interacts with the C1c protein FAP76 from the C1a - e - c supercomplex ( Fu et al . , 2019 ) , a picture of a highly interconnected C1a - e - c - d - f - b network emerges . In our cryo - ET averages of the WT CA , the tip of the C1b beam ( FAP42 ) appears to also connect with corresponding structures of the C2b projection . Previous studies also suggested that the C1b and C2b projections physically interact ; specifically , isolated cpc1 axonemes lacking the C1b projection also frequently lacked the C2b projection ( Mitchell and Sale , 1999 ) , and 18 knockdown of hydin , a C2b protein , caused loss of the C2b projection and , in some instances , destabilization of the C1b projection ( Lechtreck and Witman , 2007 ) . However , our MS / MS analyses of fap42 axonemes did not show a decrease of known C2b proteins ( Table S1 ) , and a 3D - classification analysis of the C2b projection in fap42 did not show obvious positional instability or reduction of the projection despite loss of its interface with the C1b beam structure . The FAP246 - FAP413 - FAP42 subcomplex provides mechanical support In straight flagella , the nine DMTs are cylindrically arranged , and the RSs , which project towards the center of the axoneme , end with their heads on a virtual cylinder with ~ 40 nm radius . The two parallel CA microtubules themselves could not interact with all radial spokes at the same time , but the different CA projections vary considerably in length , angle and shape , forming a dense cylindrical CA protein network with ~ 40 nm radius that could interact with the RSs from all nine DMTs ( Nicastro et al . , 2005 ) . At the current cryo - ET resolution , there appears to be an about 5 nm gap between the periphery of the CA projections and the RS heads in straight ( inactive ) axonemes ( Oda et al . , 2014 ) . In both forward and backwards swimming Chlamydomonas , the diameter of the axoneme is greater in the plane of bend of bent regions than in straight regions of the flagellum , presumably due to transverse stress acting across the axoneme during bending ( Fig . S3 ) ( Lindemann and Mitchell , 2007 ) . In the bent regions , the two central microtubules , which in Chlamydomonas rotate within the ring of 9 DMTs during flagellar beating , are both in the plane of bend , with the C1 microtubule ( predominantly ) facing DMT 1 , at least in principal bends ( Mitchell , 2003 ) . The lateral compression of the axoneme in bent regions implies that the RSs mechanically push against the CA projections in a direction perpendicular to the bend plane ; i . e . the C1a - C2a and C1b - C2b projections would be subject to the greatest compression force by the RSs in the bent region ( Fig . S3 ) . Unlike other projections , such as C1c and C1d that are short and closely associated with the C1 microtubule , the C1b beam , which would be closest to the RS heads , is located at the periphery of C1b , 20 nm from the C1 - C2 bridge , and is not directly supported by the C1 microtubule . However , the structure of C1b appears to be ideally suited to resist compressive force . The shape of the projection resembles that of a pillar - beam construction , which in 19 architecture is used to transmit load imposed on a horizontal beam ( e . g . due to the weight of the roof ) to a vertical pillar and floor , which are equipped to resist the compression force . In the case of the C1b projection , the compression force imposed by the RSs onto the FAP42 beam could be transmitted through the connection with the pillar and the FAP246 - FAP413 bracket onto the pillar and ultimately the C1 microtubule – both of which should provide more resistance to inwardly directed compressive force . In addition , neighboring beams are connected to each other at the beam tip ( close to where the beam interacts with C2b ) ( Fig . 5A and B ; Movie S4 ) , which could distribute locally imposed force by RSs across the sheet - like beam network . Defects in the FAP246 - FAP413 - FAP42 subcomplex resulted in destabilization of the remaining C1b structures and the C1f projection even in isolated inactive axonemes , i . e . without compression force imposed by bending , suggesting that the FAP246 - FAP413 - FAP42 subcomplex does indeed play a role in providing mechanical strength and support . The motility defect in the fap42 and fap246 mutants may , in part , reflect a transient abnormal compression - induced partial collapse of bent regions of the axoneme during each beat cycle . Defects in C1b also may affect the regulation of dynein arm activity . Previous studies have shown that mechanical interactions between the CA and RS heads are critical for ciliary motility . For example , Oda and colleagues showed that in the paralyzed Chlamydomonas mutant pf6 , which lacks most of the C1a - e projections , extending the RS heads by addition of a non - ciliary ( non - specific ) protein of suitable size ( e . g . a BCCP - tag ) was sufficient to restore flagellar motility ( Oda et al . , 2014 ) . Oda and colleagues proposed that the C1a projection interacted mechanically and non - specifically with the RSs of DMTs 2 , 3 and 4 to transmit signals to the dynein arms . In the fap42 and fap246 mutants studied here , loss of the C1b bracket and beam could allow the entire CA to move away from the RSs of DMTs 2 , 3 , and 4 in bent regions , partially impairing any CA - RS mechano - signaling required to activate or inactivate the dynein arms in those regions . The positions of specific projections relative to the DMTs undergoing active sliding in bent regions could explain why loss of different CA projections has different effects on flagellar motility ( Brown et al . , 2012 ; DiPetrillo and Smith , 2011 ; Lechtreck and Witman , 2007 ; Mitchell and Sale , 1999 ; Rupp et al . , 2001 ; Yokoyama et al . , 2004 ; Zhao et al . , 2019 ) . Thus the C1b projection might not only support structural integrity and stability of the CA 20 and axoneme , but the mechanical resistance that it provides might be necessary for proper mechano - signaling between the CA and RSs to regulate dynein activity and thus ciliary beating . 21 Materials and Methods Bioinformatics Domain predictions of FAP246 , FAP42 and FAP413 were performed using PROSITE webserver ( http : / / prosite . expasy . org / ) ( Sigrist et al . , 2013 ) . Sequence alignments were performed using BLAST tool from NCBI ( Altschul et al . , 1990 ) . Strains and culture conditions Chlamydomonas reinhardtii WT strains used were g1 ( nit1 , agg1 , mt + ; CC - 5415 , Chlamydomonas Resource Center , https : / / www . chlamycollection . org ) and A54 - e18 ( CC - 2929 ) . A fap246 mutant strain was originally obtained from the CLiP collection ( CLiP ID : LMJ . RY0402 . 135524 ) via the Chlamydomonas Resource Center and then crossed to g1 ; a progeny ( 135524 - 8A ) was named fap246 - 1 and used here as in our previous study ( Zhao et al . , 2019 ) . Another CLiP mutant ( LMJ . RY0402 . 2059300 ) with an insertion in exon 7 of the fap42 gene ( Li et al . , 2016 ) also was obtained from the Chlamydomonas Resource Center ; analysis by PCR ( Fig . S1 ) revealed that the cells originally supplied were genetically heterogeneous , so they were cloned , and a clone harboring the insertion was named fap42 - 1 and used in subsequent experiments . As previously described ( Fu et al . , 2018 ) , Chlamydomonas cells were maintained in solid Tris - acetate - phosphate ( TAP ) plates ( supplied with 7 . 5 µg / ml paromomycin for CLiP mutants ) and cultured in liquid TAP medium or modified M medium ( Witman , 1986 ) under a 12 : 12 - h light : dark cycle at 23°C with filtered air bubbling into the growth culture . Insertion sites of CLiP mutant fap42 were confirmed by PCR using the primers listed in Table S4 ( Fig . S1F ) . Axoneme preparation Axonemes of Chlamydomonas cells were purified by the pH - shock method as previously described ( Song et al . , 2015 ; Witman , 1986 ) . Briefly , cells were cultured in liquid TAP medium , harvested by centrifugation ( 2 , 200 rpm for 5 min ) , and washed twice with fresh M - N / 5 minimal medium ( Iomini et al . , 2009 ) . The cell pellet was resuspended in pH shock buffer ( 10 mM 22 HEPES , 1 mM SrCl 2 , 4 % sucrose , and 1 mM DTT , pH 7 . 4 ) , and 0 . 5 M acetic acid was added to the buffer to adjust the pH to 4 . 3 . After 80 s , 1 M KOH was added to increase the pH to 7 . 2 ; the pH shock treatment was performed on ice . After pH shock , 5 mM MgSO 4 , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , and 100 µl protease inhibitor PMSF ( Sigma - Aldrich ) were added to the solution . The solution was centrifuged ( 1800 g for 10 min , 4°C ) to separate the detached flagella from the cell bodies . To further purify the flagella , the flagella - containing supernatant was centrifuged twice with a 20 % sucrose cushion ( 2 , 400 g for 10 min , 4°C ) . After centrifugation , 1 % IGEPAL CA - 630 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was added to the supernatant for 20 min at 4°C to demembranate the flagella . Axonemes were collected by centrifugation ( 10 , 000 g for 10 min , 4°C ) , and the freshly isolated axonemes were resuspended in HMEEK buffer ( 30 mM Hepes , 25 mM KCl , 5 mM MgSO 4 , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , and 1 mM EGTA , pH 7 . 2 ) . Axonemal samples were either plunge - frozen for cryo - ET or stored at − 80°C for biochemical assays or MS . Analysis of motility phenotypes All observations and recordings were performed on cells grown in TAP medium at room temperature . To analyze swimming speed , 100 µl of Chlamydomonas cell culture were transferred to a plastic chamber ( 0 . 127 - mm - deep Fisherbrand UriSystem DeciSlide ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Cells were imaged with a Nikon ECLIPSE LV - N microscope equipped with an Andor Zyla sCMOS Camera . The objective lens used was a Nikon CFI S Plan Fluor ELWD 20x NA 0 . 45 with a working distance of 8 . 2 - 6 . 9 mm . Movies were recorded at 100 frame / s using NIS - Elements AR ( Nikon ) software . Swimming speeds were determined using the measurement tools in NIS - Elements AR software . The TrackMate plugin ( Tinevez et al . , 2017 ) in Fiji ImageJ was used to trace the swimming trajectory of the cells . Liquid chromatography – MS / MS Axonemal proteins ( 40 µg ) of the WT , fap42 and fap246 strains were separated on a 4 – 12 % gradient SDS - polyacrylamide gel ( Genscript Biotech ) . After the dye front migrated on the gel for 3 . 0 – 3 . 5 cm , the gel was stained with Coomassie brilliant blue for 30 min and destained until the 23 background was clear . Each gel lane was cut into four slices , and each slice was further excised into 1 - mm cubic pieces . In - gel trypsin digestion , LC - MS / MS and peptide identification were conducted by the proteomics core facility at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center . Briefly , protein gel pieces were digested overnight with trypsin ( Pierce ) following reduction and alkylation with DTT and iodoacetamide ( Sigma – Aldrich ) . The samples then underwent solid - phase extraction cleanup with a Oasis HLB µ Elution plate ( Waters ) and the resulting samples were analyzed by LC / MS / MS , using an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer ( Thermo Electron ) coupled to an Ultimate 3000 RSLC - Nano liquid chromatography system ( Dionex ) . Samples were injected onto a 75 - µm i . d . , 75 - cm long EasySpray column ( Thermo ) , and eluted with a gradient from 0 - 28 % buffer B over 90 min . Buffer A contained 2 % ( v / v ) acetonitrile and 0 . 1 % formic acid in water , and buffer B contained 80 % ( v / v ) acetonitrile , 10 % ( v / v ) trifluoroethanol , and 0 . 1 % formic acid in water . The mass spectrometer operated in positive ion mode with a source voltage of 1 . 8 kV and an ion transfer tube temperature of 275 °C . MS scans were acquired at 120 , 000 resolution in the Orbitrap and up to 10 MS / MS spectra were obtained in the ion trap for each full spectrum acquired using higher - energy collisional dissociation ( HCD ) for ions with charges 2 - 7 . Dynamic exclusion was set for 25 s after an ion was selected for fragmentation . Raw MS data files were converted to a peak list format and analyzed using the central proteomics facilities pipeline ( CPFP ) , version 2 . 0 . 3 ( Trudgian and Mirzaei , 2012 ; Trudgian et al . , 2010 ) . Peptide identification was performed using the X ! Tandem ( Craig and Beavis , 2004 ) and Open MS Search Algorithm ( OMSSA ) ( Geer et al . , 2004 ) search engines against the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii protein database , with common contaminants and reversed decoy sequences appended ( Elias and Gygi , 2007 ) . Fragment and precursor tolerances of 10 ppm and 0 . 5 Da were specified , and three missed cleavages were allowed . Carbamidomethylation of Cys was set as a fixed modification and oxidation of Met was set as a variable modification . Label - free quantitation of proteins across samples was performed using SINQ normalized spectral index software ( Trudgian et al . , 2011 ) . Cryo - ET 24 Freshly prepared axonemal samples ( 30 µl ) were gently mixed with 10 µl of 10 - fold - concentrated , BSA - coated 10 - nm gold solution ( Sigma Aldrich ) . 4 µl of the solution was applied to a glow - discharged ( 30s at 35 mA ) copper R2 / 2 holey carbon grid ( Quantifoil Micro Tools ) . After removing excess liquid by blotting the grid from the back side with Whatman filter paper for 2 s , the grid was plunge - frozen into liquid ethane using a homemade plunge - freezer . Grids were then stored in liquid nitrogen until use . Grids were loaded into a Titan Krios transmission electron microscope ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) operated at 300 kV . The microscope control software SerialEM ( Mastronarde , 2005 ) was used to acquire tilt series images in low - dose mode from − 60° to 60° with 2° increments using a dose symmetric tilting scheme ( Hagen et al . , 2017 ) . For WT axonemes , the images were recorded with a 4 , 000 × 4 , 000 K2 DDD camera ( Gatan ) in counting mode ( 15 frames , 0 . 4 - s exposure time per frame , dose rate of 8 electrons / pixel / s for each tilt image ) . For fap246 and fap42 axonemes , the images were recorded with a 5 , 760 x 4 , 092 K3 DDD camera ( Gatan ) in counting mode ( 10 frames , 0 . 05 - s exposure time per frame , dose rate of 26 electrons / pixel / s for each tilt image ) . For all strains , the post - column energy filter ( Gatan ) was operated in zero - loss mode ( 20 - eV slit width ) , and a VPP ( Danev et al . , 2014 ) was used with − 0 . 5 - µm defocus . The magnification was set to 26 , 000 with an effective pixel size of 3 . 2 Å ( K3 camera ) or 5 . 5 Å ( K2 camera ) . The total electron dose per tilt series was limited to ∼ 100 e / Å 2 . Image processing In brief , motion correction of the frames was done with MotionCorr2 ( Zheng et al . , 2017 ) . IMOD software ( Kremer et al . , 1996 ) was used to align the tilt serial images using the 10 - nm gold particles as fiducial markers and to reconstruct the tomograms by the weighted back - projection ( WBP ) approach . For subtomogram averaging , either CA or DMT repeats were picked from the raw tomograms , and alignment and missing - wedge compensated averaging were performed using PEET software ( Nicastro et al . , 2006 ) , which is integrated in the IMOD software package . The axoneme and CA orientation ( proximal to distal ) was determined for each tomogram based on both DMT orientation in the axoneme cross section and initial averages that included only the CA repeats within each tomogram . After the CA polarity and the same center 25 of the repeat were determined for each tomogram , a second alignment was performed combining the CA repeats from all tomograms in the correct orientation and periodicity register . After global alignment of all CA repeats , the alignment of each individual CA microtubule was refined by local alignment of each microtubule and its associated projections separately , while the other microtubule was masked as described previously ( Carbajal - Gonzalez et al . , 2013 ; Fu et al . , 2019 ) . Visualization of the 3D structures of the averaged CA repeats was done with the UCSF Chimera package software ( Pettersen et al . , 2004 ) . For generating isosurface renderings , the same isosurface threshold was applied to the WT and mutant averages . Mass estimations of the protein complexes and subvolumes were calculated using the average density of 1 . 43 g / cm 3 for proteins ( Quillin and Matthews , 2000 ) and after normalizing the isosurface - rendering threshold to the mass of microtubules in Chimera . Classification analyses used a principal component analysis ( PCA ) clustering method incorporated in the PEET software ( Heumann et al . , 2011 ) . The number of tomograms and CA repeats , as well as the estimated resolution of the averages ( using FSC 0 . 5 criterion ) , are summarized for each strain in Table S5 . Supplementary materials Supplementary materials contain three figures , five tables and four movies . Figure S1 shows the protein domain predictions and sequence alignments of FAP246 , FAP42 and FAP413 ; the genotype analysis of the Chlamydomonas fap42 - 1 mutant strain ; and resolution estimation of the averaged CA repeats of WT , fap246 and fap42 axonemes . Figure S2 shows full isosurface renderings of the averaged CA repeats of WT , fap246 and fap42 axonemes . Figure S3 shows the proposed model of C1b - RS mechano - signaling that regulates the dynein activities and cilia bending .
