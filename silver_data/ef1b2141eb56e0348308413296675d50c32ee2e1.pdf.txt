Using image - based transcriptomics in millions of single human cells , we ﬁnd that while variability of cytoplasmic transcript abundance is large , it is for most genes minimally stochastic and can be pre - dicted with multivariate models of the phenotypic state and population context of single cells . Compu - tational multiplexing of these predictive signatures across hundreds of genes revealed a complex regu - latory system that controls the observed variability of transcript abundance between individual cells . Mathematical modeling and experimental validation show that nuclear retention and transport of tran - scripts between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is central to buffering stochastic transcriptional ﬂuctu - ations in mammalian gene expression . Our work indi - cates that cellular compartmentalization conﬁnes transcriptional noise to the nucleus , thereby prevent - ing it from interfering with the control of single - cell transcript abundance in the cytoplasm . INTRODUCTION Gene expression in isogenic cells exposed to the same condi - tions is heterogeneous , a phenomenon referred to as gene expression noise ( Eldar and Elowitz , 2010 ; Raj and van Oude - naarden , 2008 ) . The origin of this noise can be divided between intrinsic and extrinsic sources ( Elowitz et al . , 2002 ) . Intrinsic noise is seen as the inherent consequence of stochastic ﬂuctua - tions in biochemical reactions and interactions between the components that transcribe and translate genes into mRNA and proteins , respectively ( Eldar and Elowitz , 2010 ; Raj and van Oudenaarden , 2008 ) . For instance , stochastic switching of promoters between a closed , transcription - prohibiting state and an open , permissive state can lead to bursts in transcription and consequently large variations in transcript abundance be - tween individual cells ( Golding et al . , 2005 ; Raj et al . , 2006 ; Suter et al . , 2011 ; Zenklusen et al . , 2008 ) . Extrinsic noise is deﬁned as noise that originates from upstream variations in the cellular state that results in higher or lower rates of gene expression or degra - dation and is usually the major source of cell - to - cell variability ( Raser and O’Shea , 2005 ; Snijder and Pelkmans , 2011 ) . Extrinsic noise is not necessarily of a stochastic nature , but is often considered and modeled stochastically given the complexity of the involved processes , an apparent stochasticity in distribu - tions of single - cell measurements , and an assumed inability to predict these variations at the single - cell level . In human cells , transcript abundance scales with cellular vol - ume ( Kempe et al . , 2015 ; Padovan - Merhar et al . , 2015 ) , which varies between single cells of the same population . Cellular vol - ume is thus an important source of extrinsic noise in gene expression , as has been observed previously in yeast ( Newman et al . , 2006 ; Raser and O’Shea , 2004 ) . Similarly , mitochondrial content , which is known to vary between individual mammalian cells , is a source of extrinsic noise ( das Neves et al . , 2010 ) . In proliferating mammalian cells that adapt to their multicellular context , cell - to - cell variability in these and other properties is strongly inﬂuenced by the available space to expand cell surface and volume , the relative location of a cell within a population , its local crowdedness , the amount and type of physical force it ex - periences , the extent to which it faces empty space , and its po - sition in the cell cycle ( Dupont et al . , 2011 ; Engler et al . , 2006 ; Frechin et al . , 2015 ; Gut et al . , 2015 ) . Since numerous signaling pathways that sense the cellular state and phenotypic properties of single cells and their microenvironment exist , this can result in large - scale adaptation of the transcriptome in single isogenic cells experiencing the same culture conditions . This raises the question of to which extent variability in transcript abundance in mammalian cells is of a deterministic nature and can be pre - dicted once the relevant variables of single cells that drive such adaptation are known . Particularly in the context of devel - opment and tissue homeostasis , where tight control of gene expression at the single - cell level is required , such variables could inﬂuence cell - fate decisions that may have previously been considered fully stochastic ( Arias and Hayward , 2006 ; Graf and Stadtfeld , 2008 ; Macarthur et al . , 2009 ) . Furthermore , if most variability in transcript abundance in mammalian cells can be predicted , it raises the question of how stochastic ﬂuctu - ations that arise during transcription are effectively ﬁltered out while deterministic variability is maintained . Addressing these questions requires highly accurate mea - surements of single - cell transcript abundance . A suboptimal ef - ﬁciency in detecting an individual transcript molecule in a single cell yields for most transcripts single - cell distributions that are 1596 Cell 163 , 1596 – 1610 , December 17 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Inc .

Since single - cell RNA sequencing has detection efﬁ - ciencies between 5 % – 20 % ( Deng et al . , 2014 ; Gru¨n et al . , 2014 ) , it cannot be used for sensitive analysis of sources of cell - to - cell variability in transcript abundance . Equally important for obtaining highly accurate measurements for large numbers of single cells is to avoid sampling bias of the cellular states and mi - croenvironments experienced by single cells in a population ( Battich et al . , 2013 ) . Furthermore , it is essential to quantify fea - tures of the cellular state and microenvironment of the same sin - gle cell in which transcript abundance is being measured . Finally , such measurements are ideally obtained for a large number of genes to compare distributions and identify common and gene - speciﬁc variables that determine cell - to - cell variability in transcript abundance . Here , we applied image - based transcriptomics , a high - throughput automated single - molecule ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization ( sm - FISH ) method that we recently developed ( Battich et al . , 2013 ) , which meets these requirements . Using large - scale single - cell datasets acquired with this approach , we show that cell - to - cell variability in cytoplasmic transcript abundance in human adherent cells can be accurately predicted at the single - cell level with a multivariate set of features that quantify properties of the cellular state and microenvironment , and we experimentally verify some of the underlying causality . We ﬁnd that for most genes , the unexplained variability in cyto - plasmic transcript abundance approaches a limit of minimal sto - chasticity imposed by a Poisson process . The few genes that deviate from this limit also show a high amount of explained vari - ability , suggesting high - level regulation rather than high stochas - ticity . Through computational multiplexing , we uncover the existence of multilevel transcript homeostasis in single cells to achieve speciﬁc adaptation of transcript abundance to the cellular state and microenvironment , according to function of the proteins they encode . Finally , we show that the mammalian nucleus acts as a potent and global buffer to stochastic ﬂuctua - tions arising from bursts in gene transcription by temporally re - taining transcripts in the nucleus . This explains how cytoplasmic transcript abundance in mammalian cells can be minimally sto - chastic , while deterministic variation is maintained . RESULTS Single - Cell Distributions of Cytoplasmic Transcript Abundance in a Human Cancer - Derived Cell Line and Primary Keratinocytes To study cell - to - cell variability of transcript abundance in human cells , we applied image - based transcriptomics to HeLa cells and freshly isolated primary keratinocytes . This provides high - quality images of large numbers of single cells in which each transcript is visible as a bright spot that can be robustly detected , resolved from other spots , and assigned to the corresponding cell using fully automated computer vision algorithms ( Battich et al . , 2013 ; Stoeger et al . , 2015 ) ( Figure 1A ) . As a result , accurate and reproducible transcript counts in the cytoplasm of millions of single cells and thousands of genes are obtained ( Battich et al . , 2013 ) . When visualized across cell populations , this re - veals gene - speciﬁc patterns in single cells ( Figures 1B and S1A ) . In both cell types , we identiﬁed , in a semi - automated manner , ﬁve classes of single - cell distributions of cytoplasmic tran - script abundance across 932 genes ( see http : / / image - based - transcriptomics . org ) . The vast majority of genes show a unimodal distribution ( Figures 1C , 1D , and S1B ) , which shifts from a one - tailed distribution ( class 2 ) to a skewed two - tailed distribution ( class 3 ) as the mean cytoplasmic transcript abun - dance increased . Genes displaying a skewed two - tailed distri - bution with a ﬂattened peak ( class 4 ) enrich for genes acting during the replication of DNA ( 8 of 9 genes in HeLa and 5 of 7 genes in keratinocytes ) . Rarely ( 1 . 6 % in HeLa and 2 . 8 % in kera - tinocytes ) , bimodal distributions were observed , with either one mode representing no expression and the other mode expres - sion ( class 1 ) , or with both modes representing two different levels of expression ( class 5 ) . This low fraction of bimodality compared to stimulated dendritic cells ( Shalek et al . , 2013 ) likely results from the fact that cells were unperturbed and did not experience a sudden change in culture conditions ( e . g . , addition of growth factor after serum starvation ) . Concordantly , the ma - jority of the genes that show bimodal distributions under these culture conditions act during the M phase of the cell cycle ( 60 . 0 % of HeLa class 5 , 71 . 4 % of keratinocytes class 1 , and 50 . 0 % of keratinocytes class 5 ) . We also noticed that the coefﬁ - cient of variation ( CV ) in single - cell transcript abundance decreased in both cell types monotonically from (cid:1) 2 to (cid:1) 0 . 3 as the mean transcript abundance increased , with only a few outlier genes ( 3 % – 6 % ) that show a higher CV than the bulk ( Figure 1E ) . Expectedly , these outliers are enriched in the one - tailed and bimodal distributions of cytoplasmic transcript abundance ( clas - ses 1 , 2 , and 5 ) ( Figure 1F ) . Cytoplasmic Transcript Abundance in Single Human Cells Can Be Predicted and Is Minimally Stochastic In addition , we collected from each single cell a multivariate set of 183 features that quantify properties of cell and nucleus shape and area , of protein , DNA , and mitochondrial content and texture , and of the extent of local cell crowding , number of neigh - bors , and relative location to other cells and to empty space in the cell population ( Figure 2A ) . For genes that are expressed ( Figure S2A ) , we observed that many of these features show a correlation with transcript abundance ( Figure S2B ) , prompting us to investigate the extent to which these features can collec - tively predict cytoplasmic transcript abundance in single cells . To address this , we learnt data - driven models for each gene ( D ) Gene examples with single - cell cytoplasmic transcript abundance distributions .

Generally , MLR models consisted of (cid:1) 20 PCs , which quantify a variety of different aspects of indi - vidual cells . For example , the ﬁrst six PCs of HeLa cells consist of features of local cell crowding , distance of cells to each other , their number of neighbors , distance to a cell islet edge , cell and nuclear area , cell volume ( as measured by protein content , see Figure S2C ) , mitochondrial content , DNA content ( indicating position in the cell cycle ) , nuclear morphology , cell shape , and the activity ( transcript abundance ) of neighboring cells ( Fig - ure 2A ) . In keratinocytes , the ﬁrst six PCs are highly comparable ( Figure S2D ) . Higher PCs used in the MLR models often contain highly speciﬁc properties related to cell shape , texture , or micro - environment ( data not shown ) . Next , we tested the performance of each MLR model by directly predicting cytoplasmic transcript abundance in each single cell of an independently obtained ( (cid:1) 3 weeks later ) biolog - ical replicate dataset for the same gene and comparing single - cell predictions with single - cell measurements . The models accurately reproduced single - cell distributions of cytoplasmic transcript abundance ( Figures 2B , S2E , and S2F ) . More impor - tantly , they also achieved high prediction strength ( pS ; coefﬁ - cient of determination corrected for technical variability , see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures ) at the single - cell level ( Figures 2C – 2E and S2G ) . The median pS was slightly higher in monoclonal HeLa cells ( 0 . 503 ) than in freshly isolated primary keratinocytes ( 0 . 400 ) , possibly due to uncontrolled clon - ality of the latter cells . A partial least - squares regression , as well as a non - linear approach using random forests ( Liaw and Wiener , 2002 ) on the non - transformed multivariate feature set , achieved virtually identical results ( Figure S3A ) , indicating the robustness of these statistical models . The pS increased as mean cytoplasmic transcript abundance increased , with a median pS of 0 . 29 for low - abundant transcripts ( 3 . 7 – 7 . 4 mean transcripts per cell ) and a median pS of 0 . 71 for high - abundant transcripts ( > 149 mean transcripts per cell ; see Figure S2H ) . Furthermore , as the examples of KIF11 ( a kinesin involved in spindle formation and chromosome positioning dur - ing mitosis ) , ERBB2 ( a receptor tyrosine kinase that dimerizes with epidermal growth factor receptors ) , and CLOCK ( a tran - scription factor that regulates circadian rhythms ) show , the MLR models predict the observed patterns of single - cell expres - sion in cell populations remarkably well , even for low - abundant transcripts ( Figures 2D , 2E , and S2G ) . Naturally , three - state sto - chastic models of transcription can only reproduce distributions ( Figures 2B , S2E , and S2F ) and do not have any single - cell pre - diction strength ( Figures 2C – 2E and S2G ) , nor can they repro - duce single - cell expression patterns in cell populations ( Figures 2E and S2F ) . Strikingly , when we quantiﬁed the amount of unexplained variability in cytoplasmic transcript abundance ( see the Supple - mental Experimental Procedures ) , we observed that it ap - proaches a limit of minimal stochasticity as described by a simple one - step Poisson process , also for low - abundance tran - scripts ( Figures 3A and S3A ) . Although some genes did not fall on this limit , we observed that genes whose unexplained vari - ability was furthest away from the Poisson limit , also displayed the highest amount of explained variability ( outliers of both increased h 2 Explained and h 2 Unexplained ) ( Figures 3B and S3B ) .

Thus , cytoplasmic transcript abundance of genes can be accurately predicted at the single - cell level in mammalian adherent cells , both in a cancer - derived laboratory - adapted cell line and in primary cells freshly isolated from a human donor . Single - cell prediction is achieved with features that quantify a va - riety of different aspects of the phenotypic state of individual cells , their population context , and their microenvironment . The amount of cell - to - cell variability that these features cannot pre - dict approaches for most genes a single - step Poisson limit . This suggests that somewhere along the life of an RNA molecule in mammalian cells , noise buffering occurs to ensure that cyto - plasmic transcript abundance becomes minimally stochastic . Causality between Predictors and Single - Cell Transcript Abundance High prediction strength indicates a high correlation between predictors and single - cell transcript abundance , but does not reveal the presence or direction of causality . To reveal the domi - nant direction of causality in this situation , we used four orthog - onal approaches . First , we applied Bayesian network inference on the initial da - tasets and on bulk nascent transcript synthesis measurements in single cells ( Figures S4A – S4C ) . For 83 % of the genes in which Bayesian networks could reproducibly be inferred , cytoplasmic transcript abundance was placed downstream of one or multiple single - cell features ( Figure S4A ) . The remaining genes ( 17 % ) were placed in between , being downstream of cell area or pro - tein content and upstream of DNA content or cell crowding , which correlated with gene function ( Figures S4B and S4C ) . Furthermore , this revealed that cell area and protein content ( cell volume ) are major determinants of bulk nascent transcript synthesis and cytoplasmic transcript abundance , which are in turn determined by population context effects that arise from the number of cells seeded and DNA content , which reﬂects po - sition in the cell cycle ( Figure S4D ) . Second , we grew cells on micropatterns , which constrain the available area for a single cell to spread on , resulting in a strong reduction in the cell - to - cell variability of many single - cell fea - tures , particularly in cell size and morphology ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . Based on this , we used the MLR models to predict which genes would display the strongest reduction in variability in cyto - plasmic transcript abundance in cells grown on the smallest micropatterns , and selected from these nine genes covering different biological processes ( Figure 4A ) . For all genes , as exempliﬁed by RELA , a subunit of the major transcription factor NF - k B , we observed that constraining the phenotypic state of single cells results in a strong reduction of cell - to - cell variability in cytoplasmic transcript abundance , approaching a Poisson limit ( Figures 4C and 4D ) . Strikingly , the small amount of remain - ing cell - to - cell variability in transcript abundance was accurately predicted based on the small amount of phenotypic variability re - mainingbetweensinglecellsgrownonmicropatterns ( Figure4C ) . This shows that constraining single - cell features directly con - strains cell - to - cell variability in transcript abundance . Third , we performed systematic RNA interference against 367 genes . This did not reveal any relationship between the extent to which two dominant features , nuclear area and cell crowding , correlate with cytoplasmic transcript abundance of a gene and the effect that silencing of this gene had on these two features ( Figure S4E ) . The few genes whose silencing resulted in strong effects were all essential for cell viability , leading to reduced pop - ulation sizes ( Figure 4D ) , which indirectly changes nuclear area and cell crowding . Fourth , we performed gene induction experiments . Cells grown for 72 hr were serum starved for 24 hr and subsequently treated with epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) . At 20 , 40 , and 80 min after induction , we ﬁxed cells and performed image - based transcriptomics on eight genes induced by EGF . We then learnt MLR models on each time point after induction , as well as on the serum - starved non - induced state , and used these to predict single - cell cytoplasmic transcript abundance in a repli - cate experiment ( Figure 4E ) . While pS was lower in the non - induced state or in the presence of serum , it was higher at peak expression level following induction , matching the global trend that pS scales with transcript abundance ( Figures 4F and S4F ) . As shown for JUN and FOS , two immediate early response genes , the MLR models accurately reproduced the change in distributions of cytoplasmic transcript abundance during induc - tion , including the emergence of bimodality , as well as single - cell patterns of EGF - induced gene expression in cell populations ( Figures 4G , 4H , and S4G ) . Strikingly , even MLR models learnt on serum - starved non - induced cells were able to predict the single - cell expression patterns in induced cell populations , when correcting for the difference in mean expression levels ( C ) Boxplotsshowmeasuredsingle - cellspotcountdistributions of RELA transcripts inunconstrainedcellsandconstrainedon300 - m m 2 micropatterns ( n = 1 , 874 and 694 , respectively ) .

This shows that it is largely the predeter - mined phenotypic state and microenvironment of a single cell that determines its response to EGF . Together , this shows that in human adherent cells grown in culture , the emergence of heterogeneity in phenotypic state , population context , and microenvironment of single cells is the dominant source of cell - to - cell variability in cytoplasmic tran - script abundance , making it for most genes largely predictable . This does not only apply to cells at quasi steady - state continu - ously grown in serum but also , and more profoundly , during an acute induction of gene expression by EGF , also when this leads to bimodal gene expression . Computational Multiplexing of Cytoplasmic Transcript Abundance Reveals Multilevel Transcript Homeostasis in Single Cells Next , we studied the biological information that the MLR models contain , taking advantage of their generally high prediction strength at the single - cell level . This allowed us to perform computational multiplexing ( Figure 5A ) , in which we predicted the transcript abundance of one gene in each cell of a population in which we had measured the transcript abundance of another gene . In this manner , we could calculate pairwise correlations between the predicted and measured single - cell transcript abundances for (cid:1) 2 . 5 3 10 5 gene - gene combinations across (cid:1) 5 , 000 single cells ( Figures 5A and S5A ) . We then calculated the similarity between two genes in their pairwise single - cell cor - relations with all other genes and created a similarity matrix for each cell type . The matrices contained a high degree of modality with various sub - clusters ( Figure 5A ; Table S1 ) , presenting a sys - tems - level map of single - cell transcript homeostasis in human adherent cell populations ( Figures S5B and S5C ) . To visualize this map , we created a gene interaction network for each cell type , in which two genes are connected when they were within the top 2 % highest similarity scores ( Figures 5A , 5B , and S5A ) . To reveal patterns in these networks , we ﬁrst looked at the two most dominant predictors : cell area and cell volume . Plotting the ratio of the correlation of cytoplasmic tran - script abundance with these two predictors on the networks re - vealed areas of genes with a higher correlation to cell volume or higher correlation to cell area ( Figures 5B and S5D ; Data S1 ) . The latter are strongly enriched in genes encoding for proteins that contain a signal peptide , a transmembrane domain , or that are N - glycosylated ( Figure 5B ) , as well as for cytosolic proteins with important membrane - related functions ( data not shown ) . This indicates the existence of mechanisms that allow distinct adaptation of transcript abundance to the volume or surface area of a single cell , depending on whether it encodes for a pro - tein with cytosolic or membrane - related functions . Next , we plotted on the networks the mean absolute correla - tions of transcript abundance to selected sets of features related to the population context , to cell size and shape , DNA content , and neighbor activity ( Figure 5C ) . This revealed multiple sub - regions in the networks that consist of groups of genes whose cytoplasmic transcript abundance is adapted in speciﬁc ways to different combinations of features . For example , a particularly outstanding sub - cluster present in both networks ( K1 in kerati - nocytes and H1 in HeLa ; see Figures 5D and S5E ) shows high correlations with features of DNA content and texture and nu - clear morphology and is enriched in genes that function in the cell cycle . We also noticed that within dense regions of the networks , highly differentiated and speciﬁc adaptation is visible . For instance , sub - clusters K2 and K3 lie next to each other in the ker - atinocyte network ( Figure 5C ) . Sub - cluster K2 consists of genes whose transcript abundance shows a speciﬁc and strong corre - lation with neighbor activity and contains immediate early genes ( e . g . , JUN ) , including secreted molecules ( e . g . , VEGFA and DKK1 ) ( Figure 5D ) . A similar sub - cluster was also found in HeLa cells ( H2 ; see Figure S5E ) . H2 contains genes that display high levels of both explained and unexplained variability ( compare to Figure 3B ) , including the early response genes in the EGF induction experiment ( such as JUN , FOS , and NR4A2 ) . This indicates that both cell types show a highly variable expression of a group of genes that respond quickly to signals in a correlated manner determined by the activity of cell neighbors , suggesting the involvement of paracrine signaling ( Avraham and Yarden , 2011 ) . Sub - cluster K3 consists of genes whose single - cell transcript abundance shows strong correlation with multiple sets of selected features , including those of the population context , of cell size and shape , of mitochondrial abundance , nu - clear morphology and also neighbor activity ( Figure 5D ) . It con - tains 10 of the 13 mitochondrially encoded protein - coding genes , indicating that multilevel control of single - cell transcript abundance also occurs for genes not transcribed in the nucleus . The high degree of modularity and the presence of multiple subgroups of genes whose transcript abundance is adapted in highly differentiated and speciﬁc ways in single cells exposed to the same conditions , demonstrates the existence of a com - plex multilevel transcript homeostasis system that drives cell - to - cell variability in gene expression . This ensures that levels of transcripts are precisely adapted to the physiological state of a single cell and its microenvironment according to the function of the RNA or the protein they encode for .

However , we realized that bDNA sm - FISH , unlike most methods that quantify single - cell transcript abundance , speciﬁcally de - tects transcripts in the cytoplasm . This suggests that random ﬂuctuations in transcript abundance arising from bursts in tran - scription are ﬁltered out during nuclear processing and / or export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm ( Singh and Bokes , 2012 ; Xiong et al . , 2010 ) . To test if nuclear compartmentalization can theoretically act as a buffer of transcriptional noise in mammalian cells , we developed an agent - based single - cell mathematical model and performed computer simulations ( Figure 6A ) . In the model , gene activation and transcription is governed by a three - state stochastic model ( Neuert et al . , 2013 ; Raj and van Oudenaar - den , 2008 ) , in which the gene switches randomly between an ‘‘off’’ state ( S3 ) and a transcription - competent state ( S2 ) , which switches randomly to a transcription - initiated ( S1 ) or ‘‘on’’ state and back . Once transcription is initiated , RNA synthesis occurs at randomly ﬂuctuating transcription rates . The time spent in the ‘‘on’’ and ‘‘off’’ states can be varied . Each transcript is then retained for a certain amount of time in the nucleus , after which it is transported into the cytoplasm . Nuclear retention time is used as a general term to comprise the various events between birth of a single transcript molecule and its emergence into the cytoplasm , including chromatin dissociation , nuclear diffusion , processing , and binding to and transport across the nuclear pore . It is modeled as a combination of a 3D diffusion process and a probabilistic interaction with the nuclear pore , and can be varied . Nuclear degradation of transcripts is not considered . Finally , transcript degradation in the cytoplasm is modeled as a single probabilistic function that can also be varied ( Figure 6A ) . To quantify the effect that nuclear retention has on the amount of stochasticity in transcript abundance in this model , time distributions between simulated transcript production events ( dT s ) and between nuclear export events ( dT e ) are obtained , and the distance of these distributions to a Poisson distribution determined ( Figure 6B ) . Physiological boundaries for nuclear retention times of transcripts were ob - tained from a recently collected high - quality RNA - seq dataset on lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) - induced transcription in mouse bone marrow - derived macrophages ( Bhatt et al . , 2012 ) . From 282 genes , we derived a nuclear retention time of newly syn - thesized transcripts between (cid:1) 5 – 90 min , with a median of (cid:1) 20 min ( Figure 6C ) . Because these genes are enriched in fast - responding genes during stress signaling in macrophages , these nuclear retention times are an underestimation for most other genes . We performed model simulations with different burst - like gene transcription scenarios , ranging from transcription ‘‘on’’ times ( corresponding to state S1 in the model of the gene module ; Fig - ure 6A ) between 5 – 20 min and ‘‘off’’ times ( corresponding to state S2 or S3 in Figure 6A ) between 5 – 60 min , which lie in the range of observed bursting dynamics of endogenous genes in mammalian cells ( Ochiai et al . , 2014 ) . Longer ‘‘on’’ times do not reﬂect burst - like gene expression and are already close to a Poisson limit during synthesis in the nucleus ( Figure 6D ) , while longer ‘‘off’’ times reﬂect , in our opinion , non - stochastic regula - tion , such as refractory periods , feedbacks , or oscillating cellular states ( Sanchez and Golding , 2013 ) . Within these boundaries , variability in transcript synthesis is far away from the Poisson limit ( Figure 6D ) . However , export of the produced transcripts into the cytoplasm was efﬁciently converted into a Poisson pro - cess as mean retention time increased ( Figures 6D and S6A ) . Over all bursting scenarios , a mean nuclear retention time of 15 min was able to buffer (cid:1) 57 % of the stochastic ﬂuctuations introduced by bursts , which increased to (cid:1) 90 % at 40 min of mean nuclear retention time . Importantly , when we modeled bursting scenarios with ‘‘on’’ and ‘‘off’’ times of (cid:1) 5 . 5 min ( sce - nario 1 in Figure 6D ) , we observed (cid:1) 50 % buffering already at a mean nuclear retention time of 6 min . This corresponds to the measured induction and nuclear retention times of FOS and Figure 6 .

JUN ( Figures 6C and S6B ) , indicating that the short retention times observed for fast - responding genes also have a noise buff - ering effect . Thus , for most genes , nuclear retention seems long enough to reduce stochastic variation arising from bursts in tran - scription , also for immediate early genes . Moreover , it may be that timescales of transcript retention in the nucleus are adapted to the rate of their induction . To test experimentally whether nuclear retention increases the predictability of cytoplasmic transcript abundance in single mammalian cells , we adapted bDNA sm - FISH to detect tran - scripts in the nucleus , and performed an EGF induction experi - ment where we measured both nuclear and cytoplasmic transcript abundance . As expected , the increase in cytoplasmic transcript abundance of genes reacting to EGF followed with a delay the increase in nuclear transcript abundance ( Figures S6B and S6C ) . Moreover , bursts of transcription were clearly visible in the nucleus ( Figure S6C ) . Importantly , we found that the coefﬁcient of variation ( CV 2 ) was higher in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm , in particular in cases when transcripts were less abundant . This drop in transcript variability in the cytoplasm compared to the nucleus was predicted by the model ( Figure 6E ) . Moreover , we found that MLR models have higher prediction strength on cytoplasmic transcript abundance than on nuclear transcript abundance , ( e . g . , 2 . 5 - fold higher for FOS and JUN ) , which is consistent with the agent - based model ( Figure 6F ) . In addition , when we overexpressed NUP153 , a nuclear pore component that upon overexpression reduces mRNA nuclear export ( Bastos et al . , 1996 ) , we observed a reduction in cyto - plasmic transcript variability for JUN , 20 min after induction with EGF ( Figure S6D ) . Next , we used long - term time - lapse imaging of single HeLa cells expressing an inducible transcript containing 24 bacterio - phage MS2 stem loops , as well as Halo - tagged MS2 coat pro - tein , which binds to the stem loops ( Halstead et al . , 2015 ) . Time - lapse imaging carried out for 5 – 13 hr after gene induction showed repeated bursts of transcription in the nucleus ( Fig - ure 6G ) . We also observed a transient accumulation of tran - scripts at the inner nuclear envelope , and a delay between the increase in nuclear transcript abundance and cytoplasmic transcript abundance , both indicative of nuclear retention ( Fig - ure 6G ) . From the movies , we estimated that the length of bursts ( ‘‘on’’ times ) were 10 – 60 min , the intervals between bursts ( ‘‘off’’ times ) were 20 – 100 min , and nuclear retention time was (cid:1) 40 min . These values are within the range of the modeled parameter space , and thus predict that cytoplasmic transcript abundance should display less stochastic variability than nuclear transcript abundance . To measure this within the same single cells , we calculated the autocorrelation in tran - script abundance over time in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm . A low autocorrelation is indicative of stochastic ﬂuctuations . Consistent with the model’s predictions , we observed that autocorrelation measurements of transcript abundance over up to 1 - hr time periods are higher in the cyto - plasm than in the nucleus ( Figures 6H and S6E ) . This directly shows that during gene induction , transcript abundance shows more stochastic ﬂuctuations over time in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm , indicative of buffering through nuclear compart - mentalization and retention . Taken together , this showed that cellular compartmentaliza - tion separating the nucleus from the cytoplasm is an efﬁcient mechanism to dampen stochastic ﬂuctuations arising from bursts in gene transcription for most genes . This explains how cytoplasmic transcript abundance in single cells can approach a Poisson limit of minimal stochasticity despite the occurrence of burst - like gene transcription . DISCUSSION In this study , we perform highly accurate measurements of tran - scriptabundanceinlargenumbersofsingleadherenthumancells with single - molecule resolution for a thousand genes using im - age - based transcriptomics . We combine these measurements with a multivariate set of features from the same single cells that quantify multiple properties of the cellular state , their population context , and their microenvironment . We show that multilinear regression models based on these features can predict single - cell distributions , have high prediction strength on single - cell transcript abundance , and can accurately predict single - cell expression patterns . The amount of variability not explained by multilinear regression approaches a system of minimal stochas - ticity given by a Poisson process . The causality underlying this high predictability stems from mechanisms by which the cellular state , the population context , and the microenvironment deter - mine cytoplasmic transcript abundance in single cells , for which we provide a systems - level map across several hundred genes . Finally , we show that mammalian cells can achieve minimal sto - chasticity in cytoplasmic transcript abundance by means of nu - clear compartmentalization , which , through temporally retaining transcripts in the nucleus , provides a general and potent mecha - nism to buffer stochastic ﬂuctuations caused by bursts in gene transcription . An independent simultaneous study conﬁrms that also within tissues , mammalian cells display nuclear retention of transcripts to buffer noise ( Halpern et al . , 2015 ) . Our ﬁndings pertain to virtually all of the genes analyzed in adherent human cells , both when cells are at quasi steady state in the continuous presence of serum , as well as during acute gene induction experiments after a period of serum starvation . This illustrates that even at time - scales of less than 1 hr , a differ - ential response in the upregulation of cytoplasmic transcript abundance in single adherent mammalian cells is largely of non - stochastic origin . Only a few genes display simultaneously a high degree of explainable variability as well as a high degree of unexplainable variability . These are immediate early response genes , the transcripts of which accumulate rapidly in the cyto - plasm after induction of expression , are only shortly retained in the nucleus and are subject to high cytoplasmic turnover . While this limits the nucleus’ ability to completely ﬁlter out stochastic variability caused by bursts in gene transcription for these genes , their relatively brief nuclear retention still has a sufﬁcient noise dampening effect . Thus , while cell - to - cell variability in cyto - plasmic transcript abundance in mammalian cells is often large , our ﬁndings show that the cause of this variability is not stochas - tic , but is determined by a multilevel system regulating transcript homeostasis in single cells . The use of nuclear retention for noise ﬁltering underscores the notion that mammalian cells do not rely on the induction of gene Cell 163 , 1596 – 1610 , December 17 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Inc . 1607 transcription for very fast responses . For the fastest responding genes in mammalian cells , such as FOS and JUN , nuclear reten - tion times appear adjusted to the rate of induction , short enough to minimize the delay in response , but long enough to enable efﬁ - cient noise buffering . In prokaryotes , where a nucleus is absent and RNA pre - pro - cessing is minimal , transcriptional responses can make use of co - transcriptional translation and can thus be very fast ( Bird , 1995 ; Martin and Koonin , 2006 ) . Also in single - cell eukaryotes , such as yeast , which show less extensive nuclear processing of transcripts and have considerably smaller nuclei , transcriptional responses may overall be somewhat faster than in mammalian cells ( Kresnowati et al . , 2006 ) . This suggests that as cells ac - quiredanucleusduring evolutionandformedmulticellular organ - isms , the increased complexity in nuclear RNA processing came with the additional beneﬁt of ﬁltering out stochasticity in gene transcription , at a slight expense of response time . Several mechanisms of buffering noise in mammalian gene expression have been proposed , mostly involving gene - speciﬁc solutions , such as feedback or feedforward motifs in their tran - scriptional regulation , or the co - expression of its own microRNA ( Arias and Hayward , 2006 ; Li et al . , 2009 ; Milo et al . , 2002 ; Schmiedel et al . , 2015 ) . Cellular compartmentalization into the nucleus and the cytoplasm however acts more globally . Thus , regulation of nuclear retention may be a primary mechanism for noise buffering of gene transcription in mammalian cells , with additional mechanisms allowing further gene - speciﬁc adap - tation . While a relatively slow rate of transcript degradation in mammalian cells may also contribute to buffering stochastic ﬂuctuations , this also affects the mean abundance of a transcript and its ability to respond . Buffering through nuclear retention does not or to a much lesser extent have these drawbacks . The broad range of nuclear retention times for individual genes in mammalian cells suggests the existence of mechanisms to couple nuclear retention time to transcription dynamics , which is more sophisticated than our simpliﬁed model . Indeed , tran - script release from the nucleus , or transcript storage within sub - compartments of the nucleus , is additionally regulated ( Bhatt et al . , 2012 ; Culjkovic - Kraljacic et al . , 2012 ; Prasanth et al . , 2005 ; Taddei et al . , 2006 ) , and such a coupling may involve association of active transcription sites to nuclear pores ( Taddei et al . , 2006 ) , and the direct participation of nuclear pore compo - nents in the regulation of transcription machinery ( Schneider et al . , 2015 ) . Finally , besides the generally accepted view that nuclear compartmentalization of the genome during the course of evolu - tion allowed more complex gene regulation and the rise of multicellular organisms , we speculate that it provides another important advantage : it allows a buffering of transcriptional noise , resulting in a tighter control of gene expression variability that is essential for successful multicellular development .

Cell Cultivation HeLa cells were cultivated and seeded for experiments as described previ - ously ( Battich et al . , 2013 ) . Keratinocytes were cultivated in CnT - 57 medium ( CELLnTEC ) supplemented at 1 : 100 ( v : v ) with Pen Strep ( GIBCO ) . Image - Based Transcriptomics Image - based transcriptomics , including sample processing and computa - tional object detection , were performed as described previously ( Battich et al . , 2013 ; Stoeger et al . , 2015 ) . Brieﬂy , cells were seeded in 384 - well plates , and transcripts of distinct genes were stained in separate wells by branched DNA single - molecule ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization using ViewRNA re - agents ( Affymetrix ) on an automated experimental platform and imaged using a CellVoyager 7000 ( Yokogawa ) with an enhanced CSU - X1 spinning disk ( Microlens - enhanced dual Nipkow disk confocal scanner , wide view type ) and a 40 3 Olympus objective of 0 . 95 NA and Neo sCMOS cameras ( Andor ; 2 , 560 3 2 , 160 pixels ) . Predictions of Spots per Cell Multilinear regression ( MLR ) models of spots per cell were trained using the robustﬁt function of MATLAB and applied to an independent biological replicate . Stochastic simulations were carried out using the Gillespie algorithm . In Vivo Imaging of Transcripts HeLa 11ht cells ( Weidenfeld et al . , 2009 ) stably expressing a doxycycline - inducible Renilla luciferase transcript that contains a chimeric b - globin / immu - noglobulin G intron in the 5 0 UTR , and 24 copies of the MS2 stem loops in the 3 0 UTR ( HeLa 11ht MS2 ) were kindly provided by Jeffrey Chao ( Friedrich Miescher Institute ) . To visualize transcripts tagged with the MS2 stem loops , HeLa 11ht MS2 cells were imaged in an inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti - E micro - scope equipped with the Yokogawa Spinning Disc System W1 and a Nikon CFI PlanApo 100 3 oil - immersion objective .
