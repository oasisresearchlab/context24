Pollard , Yale University , New Haven , CT , and approved July 10 , 2008 ( received for review May 28 , 2008 ) Actin ﬁlament binding by the focal adhesion ( FA ) - associated pro - tein talin stabilizes cell - substrate adhesions and is thought to be rate - limiting in cell migration . Although F - actin binding by talin is known to be pH - sensitive in vitro , with lower afﬁnity at higher pH , the functional signiﬁcance of this pH dependence is unknown . Because increased intracellular pH ( pH i ) promotes cell migration and is a hallmark of metastatic carcinomas , we asked whether it increases FA remodeling through lower - afﬁnity talin – actin bind - ing . Talin contains several actin binding sites , but we found that only the COOH - terminal USH - I / LWEQ module showed pH - depen - dent actin binding , with lower afﬁnity and decreased maximal binding at higher pH . Molecular dynamics simulations and NMR of this module revealed a structural mechanism for pH - dependent actin binding . A cluster of titratable amino acids with upshifted pK a values , including His - 2418 , was identiﬁed at one end of the ﬁve - helix bundle distal from the actin binding site . Protonation of His - 2418 induces changes in the conformation and dynamics of the remote actin binding site . Structural analyses of a mutant talin - H2418F at pH 6 . 0 and 8 . 0 suggested changes different from the WT protein , and we conﬁrmed that actin binding by talin - H2418F was relatively pH - insensitive . In motile ﬁbroblasts , increasing pH i de - creased FA lifetime and increased the migratory rate . However , expression of talin - H2418F increased lifetime 2 - fold and decreased the migratory rate . These data identify a molecular mechanism for pH - sensitive actin binding by talin and suggest that FA turnover is pH - dependent and in part mediated by pH - dependent afﬁnity of talin for binding actin . intracellular pH (cid:1) NHE1 (cid:1) migration F ocal adhesion ( FA ) remodeling is a rate - limiting determinant in haptokinetic migration of adherent cells . At the leading edge of migrating cells , FAs undergo rapid cycles of assembly and turnover , creating and disrupting , respectively , sites of traction necessary for forward movement of the cell body . Force generation for traction requires linkage among the extracellular matrix , integrin receptors , and actin filaments . Actin filaments do not directly bind to the cytoplasmic domain of integrins but bind to integrin - associated FA proteins such as talin and vincu - lin . Although several mechanisms contribute to FA remodeling in migrating cells ( 1 ) , emerging evidence indicates that talin plays a central role in the dynamic linkage between integrins and actin filaments necessary for cell migration ( 2 , 3 ) . Talin functions in distinct albeit complementary mechanisms that promote FA turnover . First is cleavage of talin by the protease calpain , which also modulates adhesion complex composition and likely signal - ing functions of talin ( 4 ) . Second is regulated talin binding to actin filaments , which is proposed to act as a clutch to control FA turnover and membrane protrusion dynamics ( 3 , 5 – 7 ) . How actin binding by talin is dynamically regulated during cell migration , however , remains undetermined . Previous studies indicate that actin binding by talin in vitro is pH - sensitive , with lower - affinity binding at higher pH ( 8 – 10 ) , although the functional significance of this regulation is un - known . In motile cells , an increase in intracellular pH ( pH i ) promotes FA remodeling ( 11 – 13 ) and velocity ( 12 , 14 ) . We speculated that increased pH i in motile cells might promote dynamic turnover of FAs by lowering the affinity of actin binding by talin . We examined this speculation by using constant - pH molecular dynamics ( CpHMD ) simulations , pH - dependent NMR structure , and biochemical analysis , which revealed a mechanism for pH - sensitive actin binding by talin . Because talin1 is the likely FA talin , our data refer to this isoform . We tested structural predictions in migrating fibroblasts and found that talin acts as an exquisitely sensitive pH sensor in binding actin filaments and in controlling FA stability and migratory rate . These data suggest that a clutch - like mechanism controlling FA turnover is pH - sensitive . Results Decreased pH Increases the Affinity of F - Actin Binding by Talin . Because the NH 2 - terminal FERM domain and the COOH - terminal I / LWEQ domain of talin contain actin binding sites that could mediate a clutch - like action for FA remodeling ( 15 ) , we tested the pH dependence of actin binding by each domain . Using F - actin cosedimentation , we found that actin binding by the FERM domain ( 1 – 433 ) and the I / LWEQ domain including the coiled - coil dimerization segment ( 2341 – 2541 ) was pH - insensitive within the physiological range of pH 6 . 5 – 7 . 5 ( Fig . 1 A and B ) . There also was no change in total F - actin at pH 6 . 5 compared with pH 7 . 5 . However , maximum F - actin binding ( B max ) by a module containing the I / LWEQ domain and the adjacent upstream helical segment ( USH ) ( 2300 – 2541 ) was pH - sensitive and (cid:1) 2 - fold greater at pH 6 . 5 ( 42 . 7 (cid:2) 3 . 1 % ) compared with pH 7 . 5 ( 20 . 8 (cid:2) 2 . 0 % ) ( P (cid:3) 0 . 01 , n (cid:4) 7 ) ( Fig . 1 C ) . Additionally , at pH 6 . 5 the K d of 2 . 92 (cid:2) 0 . 62 (cid:1) M was significantly lower compared with a K d of 8 . 68 (cid:2) 3 . 91 (cid:1) M at pH 7 . 5 ( P (cid:3) 0 . 01 , n (cid:4) 3 ) . Although the I / LWEQ domain is a conserved actin - binding module also found in the fungal protein Sla2p , Dicty - ostelium TalA and TalB , and metazoan proteins Hip1 ( Hunting - ton - interacting protein 1 ) and Hip12 , ( 16 ) , the adjacent USH segment was previously reported to inhibit F - actin binding in Author contributions : J .

However , attenuated actin binding by the USH segment was determined at pH 8 , which is consistent with our data indicating that the USH segment plays a pivotal role in conferring decreased affinity for F - actin binding by the I / LWEQ domain at higher pH values . Simulations Suggest That Talin – Actin Binding Is Allosterically Regu - lated by pH . Computer simulations were carried out to investigate possible mechanisms by which F - actin binding by the USH - I / LWEQ module of talin could be regulated by pH . The simula - tions were originally carried out by using a homology model based on the structure of Hip1R ( Hip - 1 - related ) . During the course of this study , Critchley and coworkers determined an NMR structure of the talin I / LWEQ domain ( 18 ) including the USH segment , but excluding the COOH - terminal dimerization domain ( Protein Data Bank ID code 2JSW ) . Simulations using this NMR structure led to conclusions very similar those of the homology model , and those results are shown here . The I / LWEQ domain contains only one histidine residue , His - 2418 . Near this residue there are also a number of negatively charged amino acids , and computational pK a prediction using multiconforma - tion continuum electrostatics ( 19 ) suggested that Glu - 2337 , Glu - 2342 , Glu - 2481 , and Asp - 2482 could have upshifted pK a values . We hypothesized that some or all of these residues form a pH sensor . All five are clustered at one end of the five - helix bundle ( Fig . 2 A ) distal from the putative actin binding site as defined by mutagenesis ( 20 ) and are conserved in mammalian talin1 but not in Caenorhabditis elegans or Drosophila . To investigate how the structure and dynamics of the talin USH - I / LWEQ module might be modulated by pH , CpHMD simulations were carried out at several pH values . We report results of the simulations and NMR data at pH 6 . 0 and 8 . 0 to emphasize the effect of changing protonation states . Results at intermediate pH values corresponding to those used in the in vivo experiments smoothly interpolate between these two ex - tremes . Between pH 6 . 0 and 8 . 0 the side chain of His - 2418 showed a large change in its fractional protonation ( pH 6 . 0 , 73 % protonated ; pH 8 . 0 , 2 % ) . The simulations also suggested that Asp - 2482 might have a significantly upshifted pK a and titrate in this range as well ( pH 6 . 0 , 98 % protonated ; pH 8 . 0 , 0 % ) . However , this residue is located at the immediate COOH terminus of the construct , and this prediction could be an artifact of the particular monomeric construct used . Significant differences in structure and dynamics were ob - served between pH 6 . 0 and pH 8 . 0 mediated by the changing protonation states [ Fig . 2 A and supporting information ( SI ) Fig . S1 ] . The backbone rmsd between the average structures at pH 6 . 0 and 8 . 0 is 4 . 2 Å . Some of the most pronounced differences in the backbone structure and dynamics were distant from the pH sensor , especially the loop connecting helices II and III . Significant conformational changes also were seen in portions of the helices near this loop including residues implicated in actin binding ( 20 ) . Backbone conformational changes in the pH sensor itself were also significant . The computational simulations thus Fig . 1 . Actin binding by the C terminus of talin is pH - dependent .

PNAS (cid:1) September 23 , 2008 (cid:1) vol . 105 (cid:1) no . 38 (cid:1) 14437 C E LL B I O L O G Y suggest a model in which protonation of residues in the pH sensor , including His - 2418 , may modulate conformation and dynamics of distal residues in the actin binding site . NMR Spectral Perturbations Are Associated with pH Changes . To test this model , NMR experiments were carried out on the talin USH - I / LWEQ domain lacking the COOH - terminal dimeriza - tion helix ( 2300 – 2501 ) at several pH values . Increasing solvent pH from 6 . 0 to 8 . 0 was associated with spectral perturbations for a subset of backbone amide resonances in the 2D 15 N - HSQC spectrum of talin USH - I / LWEQ ; these peaks showed significant alterations in chemical shift , intensity , or both ( Fig . 2 B and D and Fig . S2 ) . In agreement with modeling results , the residues showing the largest chemical shift changes and / or the most pronounced line broadening cluster largely to two regions at opposite ends of the USH - I / LWEQ domain : the pole containing the residues we predict to comprise the pH sensor and an area on the opposite pole proximal to the putative actin binding site ( 20 ) and the loop joining helices IV and V ( Fig . 2 B ) . These spectral perturbations indicate there are significant changes in structure or dynamics and the charge of titrating side - chain groups in the talin USH - I / LWEQ module on increasing pH from 6 . 0 to 8 . 0 . Actin binding to I / LWEQ domains requires (cid:5) 40 residues at the COOH terminus that are proposed to form a coiled coil responsible for dimerization ( 20 , 21 ) . Using actin cosedimenta - tion , we confirmed previous findings ( 22 ) that a COOH - terminal - truncated talin ( 2341 – 2501 ) lacking the dimerization domain does not bind F - actin ( data not shown ) . However , comparison of amide ( 1 H N , 15 N ) chemical shift changes with pH ( 6 . 0 vs . 8 . 0 ) for monomeric and dimeric USH - I / LWEQ showed almost identical changes for constructs with and without the C - terminal dimerization helix ( Fig . S3 ) . This result suggests that the model of pH allosterically regulating the talin binding site , although based on simulations and NMR experiments using a monomeric construct , may also explain the pH - dependent bind - ing of full - length , dimeric talin to actin . To probe whether the single histidine residue ( His - 2418 ) in the talin USH - I / LWEQ module plays a role in pH sensing , we determined the pK a of His - 2418 by NMR ( Fig . 2 C ) . pH titrations observing the histidine H (cid:2) 2 proton indicated that His - 2418 has a pK a of 7 . 2 , which is upshifted from the (cid:5) 6 . 5 pK a of isolated histidine in aqueous buffer ( 23 ) . H2418F Mutant Shows Different Spectral Perturbations in Response to pH Change . To further investigate the role of the His - 2418 in pH sensing , several possible mutants were generated and investi - gated in silico by using CpHMD simulations , with the goal of identifying a mutant with reduced pH dependence . Of these , the mutant USH - I / LWEQ - H2418F was found to generate the small - est perturbations to the backbone structure and dynamics of the protein at pH 8 . 0 ( 3 . 2 - Å backbone rmsd between mutant and WT ) and larger changes at pH 6 . 0 ( 4 . 8 - Å backbone rmsd ) . This prediction was confirmed by NMR HSQC experiments . Two - dimensional 15 N - HSQC spectra of WT USH - I / LWEQ and the H2418F mutant at pH 8 . 0 were essentially identical , apart from a few residues around the phenyalanine substitution that showed small chemical shift changes ( Fig . 3 B ) , indicating that the backbone structures of the mutant and WT are similar at pH 8 . 0 . Decreasing pH from 8 . 0 to 6 . 0 led to chemical shift perturbations in the mutant and WT ( Fig . 3 and Figs . S2 and S4 ) . Many of the same residues were affected in the H2418F mutant and WT ; however , signals for amino acids often shifted in different directions in 2D 15 N - HSQC spectra . Additionally , the patterns of chemical shift changes were dissimilar , indicating that chemical environments and structure in the mutant and WT apparently differ at pH 6 . 0 . Taken together , the simulations and NMR data suggest that the mutant would undergo different structural and dynamical changes as a function of pH compared with WT protein ( Fig . 3 A and Fig . S5 ) , supporting the model that protonation of His - 2418 may modulate the conformation and dynamics of portions of the USH - I / LWEQ domain near the actin binding site , including the solvent exposure of actin binding site residues . Because the H2418F mutant shows significant pH - dependent conformational and dynamical changes , albeit different from those of the WT , we suspect that other residues in the pH sensor could also play a role together with His - 2418 . Decreased pH i Decreases FA Turnover . We used two strategies to show that decreased pH i increases FA lifetime . First , we used fibroblasts deficient for the Na - H exchanger NHE1 but stably expressing WT NHE1 ( WT cells ) or a mutant NHE1 with an E266I substitution that lacks proton translocation ( E266I cells ) ( 12 , 24 ) . NHE1 plays a central role in regulating pH i by catalyzing an electroneutral exchange of extracellular Na (cid:7) for intracellular H (cid:7) . The pH i of migrating WT and E266I cells is (cid:5) 7 . 5 and (cid:5) 7 . 0 , respectively ( 25 ) , and migratory rate of E266I cells is (cid:5) 8 - fold slower than WT cells ( 12 ) . FA turnover in cells migrating at the edge of a wounded monolayer was determined by real - time imaging of GFP - paxillin , which localized to FAs ( Fig . 4 A and Movies S1 and S2 ) and had similar expression in WT and E266I cells ( Fig . S6 ) . The lifetime of FAs in extending lamellipodia was shorter in WT cells ( 15 . 5 (cid:2) 1 . 1 min ) compared with E266I cells ( 37 . 1 (cid:2) 3 . 2 min ) ( Fig . 4 B ) ( P (cid:3) 0 . 001 , n (cid:4) 80 FA ) . Additionally , although the total number of FAs in WT and E266I cells was similar ( data not shown ) , the proportion of large ( (cid:1) 8 (cid:1) m 2 ) FAs was greater in E266I cells than in WT cells ( Fig . 4 C ) .

Second , we used NHE1 - deficient fibroblasts expressing the System N1 transporter ( SN1 cells ) . SN1 is an amino acid transporter that catalyzes the exchange of extracellular glu - tamine for intracellular H (cid:7) , and increased extracellular glu - tamine drives an increase in H (cid:7) efflux and pH i ( 26 ) . We found that decreasing glutamine in the medium from 400 (cid:1) M to 25 (cid:1) M decreased pH i from 7 . 3 to 6 . 9 and decreased the migratory rate of SN1 cells at the edge of a wounded monolayer ( Fig . 4 D ) . Mean FA lifetime in SN1 cells was significantly longer with lower pH i ( 37 (cid:2) 2 . 2 min ) than with higher pH i ( 16 . 7 (cid:2) 1 . 5 min ) ( Fig . 4 E ) ( P (cid:3) 0 . 001 , n (cid:4) 67 for 25 (cid:1) M and n (cid:4) 54 for 400 (cid:1) M ) . These data indicate that FAs are more stable at lower pH i . Talin - H2418F Has Decreased pH - Sensitive Actin Binding and Modulates FA Lifetime . To test our predicted structural model of pH sensing by talin , we used F - actin cosedimentation to show that a H2418F substitution in the USH - I / LWEQ segment ( H2418F ; 2300 – 2541 ) had reduced pH - dependent actin binding . At pH 6 . 5 , B max ( 34 . 8 % ) was less than WT USH - I / LWEQ but unchanged at pH 7 . 5 ( 33 . 2 % ) ( Fig . 5 A ) . Additionally , dissociation constants for the mutant were relatively pH - insensitive . K d values at pH 6 . 5 and 7 . 5 were 3 . 99 (cid:2) 1 . 22 (cid:1) M and 5 . 95 (cid:2) 2 . 7 (cid:1) M , respectively , and not significantly different ( P (cid:1) 0 . 1 , n (cid:4) 3 ) . Because actin binding by USH - I / LWEQ - H2418F was rela - tively pH - insensitive but had an ‘‘intermediate’’ affinity and maximal binding compared with WT at low and high pH , we asked whether it affected FA remodeling , with the prediction that FA lifetime would increase in WT cells but decrease in E266I cells . In cells at the edge of a wounded monolayer , full - length GFP - talin and GFP - talin - H2418F localized with co - expressed cherry - paxillin in FAs ( Fig . 5 B ) . Expression of GFP - talin and GFP - talin - H2418F was similar in both cell types , and cleaved fragments were not observed by immunoblotting with antibodies to GFP ( Fig . S6 ) . In WT cells , FA lifetime was not significantly different with expression of GFP - talin compared with cells expressing GFP - paxillin only ( P (cid:1) 0 . 1 , n (cid:4) 60 ) but was significantly increased with expression of GFP - talin - H2418F ( P (cid:3) 0 . 001 , n (cid:4) 60 ) ( Fig . 5 C and D and Movies S3 and S4 ) . Additionally , mean FA size was significantly greater in cells expressing GFP - talin - H2418F ( 9 . 1 (cid:2) 0 . 5 (cid:1) m 2 ) than in cells expressing WT GFP - talin ( 7 . 6 (cid:2) 0 . 4 (cid:1) m 2 ; P (cid:3) 0 . 05 , n (cid:4) 60 ) . Consistent with increased lifetime of FAs , the migration velocity of WT cells expressing GFP - talin - H2418F was significantly slower compared with cells expressing WT GFP - talin ( P (cid:3) 0 . 002 , n (cid:4) 20 cells ) ( Fig . 5 E ) . In contrast , expression of GFP - talin - H2418F in E266I cells significantly decreased FA lifetime ( P (cid:3) 0 . 01 , n (cid:4) 58 ) ( Fig . 5 D and Movies S5 and S6 ) and increased migratory velocity compared with E266I cells expressing GFP - paxillin only ( data not shown ) or GFP - talin ( Fig . 5 E ) . In E266I cells , the increase in migratory velocity with GFP - talin - H2418F was significant ( P (cid:3) 0 . 01 , n (cid:4) 20 ) but smaller in magnitude compared with the decrease in WT cells , most likely because absence of NHE1 activity in motile cells also impairs polarity ( 25 ) and actin filament assembly ( 14 ) . These data indicate that substitution of H2418F in talin changes FA stability , attenuating Fig . 4 . Decreasing pH i increases FA lifetime .

Our data also suggest that His - 2418 in talin is a key residue in sensing intracellular pH changes to regulate FA stability and cell migration rate . Discussion Increased pH i was previously suggested to promote FA remod - eling ( 12 , 13 ) , and we now show that talin acts as a pH sensor in regulating the stability of FAs . Through a combination of computational simulations , NMR , and functional studies , we demonstrate that talin His - 2418 plays a key role in pH sensing and pH - dependent actin binding . Computational data provide a structural model for pH sensing in a monomeric USH - I / LWEQ construct , suggesting that protonation of His - 2418 modulates conformation and dynamics at the remote actin binding site . NMR chemical shift mapping revealed pH - dependent changes both around the cluster of residues in the vicinity of His - 2418 , which has an upshifted pK a value , and the actin binding site . The NMR data and computational simulations suggest a model where residues in the talin pH sensor and actin binding site are conformationally coupled through residues in the helices of the I / LWEQ module , although additional work is necessary to identify the mechanism of this coupling and to determine whether modulation is allosteric . Our data also suggest that regulated actin binding by the COOH terminus of talin may be an important determinant in FA remodeling . Although we showed that the NH 2 - terminal FERM domain of talin binds F - actin , as previously reported ( 15 ) , binding is pH - insensitive . Whether actin binding by the FERM domain has functional significance in cells is unclear . The FERM domain is not sufficient for force generation at FAs . Impaired force generation in talin - null cells is restored by expression of full - length talin but not by a truncated talin lacking the COOH terminus but retaining the FERM domain ( 27 ) . Additionally , a mutant talin lacking the FERM domain but retaining the COOH terminus targets to FAs ( 22 ) . Although the FERM domain binds the cytoplasmic domain of (cid:3) integrins ( 28 ) , the COOH terminus of talin1 contains a second integrin binding site ( amino acids 1984 – 2113 ) ( 2 ) . FA remodeling in motile cells is regulated by multiple mech - anisms that likely vary with cell type , substratum , and migratory cue . Kinases , including FA kinase ( FAK ) , Src , extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( ERK ) , and myosin light chain kinase , and adaptor proteins , including paxillin and p130CAS , regulate FA turnover in migrating cells ( 1 ) . Additionally , three mecha - nisms could account for dynamic changes in talin - mediated linkage of actin filaments to FAs . First is talin binding to integrins , although whether this is dynamically regulated in motile cells has not been reported . Second is calpain cleavage of talin , which also disassembles other FA components , including paxillin , vinculin , and zyxin ( 4 ) . Third is regulated talin affinity for F - actin , which our current data and previous findings ( 8 – 10 ) show is pH - dependent . Because integrin activation ( 11 , 29 ) , growth factors ( 11 , 25 , 30 ) , and monolayer wounding ( 25 ) stimulate NHE1 activity and increase pH i , pH - dependent FA remodeling could be regulated by different migratory cues . Our current study suggests that pH - regulated FA remodeling by dynamic changes in talin affinity for F - actin may be one of several complementary mechanisms controlling FA turnover . An intriguing aspect of pH sensitivity is the ability to regulate multiple proteins in unison . Increased pH i is an evolutionarily conserved signal necessary for several stages of cell migration in addition to FA remodeling , including polarity ( 12 , 14 , 25 ) and the assembly of cytoskeletal filaments ( 14 , 31 ) . Moreover , in addition to talin a number of proteins have pH - dependent actin binding , including HIP1 ( 17 ) , cofilin ( 32 ) , and villin ( 33 ) . Of notable significance is that increased pH i is a hallmark of most metastatic cancers , regardless of the tissue origin or genetic background ( 34 ) . Hence , the higher pH i of metastatic cells compared with normal cells could increase FA turnover to promote migratory capacity . Moreover , our study underscores the importance of bridging structural and cellular biology to elucidate how physiological changes in pH i regulate cell behaviors . Materials and Methods CellCultureandDNAConstructs . Materialsandmethodsforcellculture ( 11 , 24 , 25 ) and pH i measurements ( 24 ) were as previously described . Transient ex - pression of proteins was obtained by transfection with FuGENE 6 ( Roche ) . GFP - talin was provided by Anna Huttenlocher ( University of Wisconsin , Mad - ison ) , and GFP - paxillin and cherry - paxillin were obtained from Christopher Turner ( State University of New York , Syracuse ) and Torsten Wittmann ( Uni - versity of California , San Francisco ) , respectively . GST fusions of mouse talin1 were subcloned into pGEX6P2 and expressed and puriﬁed as previously de - scribed ( 24 ) . GST was cleaved with PreScission Protease ( GE Healthcare Bio - sciences ) . Site - directedmutagenesiswasperformedtoobtainH2418Fmutants of talin in pGEX6P2 ( talin 2300 – 2541 , 2300 – 2501 ) or in pEGFP ( full length GFP - talin ) vectors . F - Actin Cosedimentation .

Proteins in supernatant and pellet fractions were separated by SDS / PAGE and stained with Coomassie . pH - dependent dissociation constants were calculated from transformation of binding curves by using GraphPad Prism 5 software . MD Simulations . All CpHMD simulations were carried out by using the AMBER 8 suite of programs ( 35 ) . The AMBER parm99 force ﬁeld ( 36 ) and generalized Born solvation model ( 37 ) were used . Detailed procedures are provided in SI Materials and Methods . Analyses were carried out for the ﬁnal 5 ns of each simulation , primarily with the ptraj program , and Pymol ( 38 ) and VMD ( 39 ) were used for visualization purposes . NMR . For protein expression , transformed BL21 cells were grown in minimal medium [ Na 2 HPO 4 , KH 2 PO 4 , NaCl , MgSO 4 , CaCl 2 , MEM vitamin mix ( Gibco ) , 15 NH 4 Cl , 13 C glucose , Isogrow 15 N 13 C , biotin , and FeCl 2 ] with ampicillin . GST fusionproteinswithaninterveningPreScissionproteaserecognitionsitewere expressed and puriﬁed as described ( 24 ) , cleaved on - column with PreScission protease , eluted , and concentrated to 1 mM . Experiments were performed on Bruker DRX 500 and Avance 800 MHz spectrometers . Initial 1 H N , 15 N , 13 C (cid:4) , 13 C (cid:3) , and 13 C (cid:9) backbone resonance as - signments of a shorter talin USH - I / LWEQ construct lacking the dimerization helix ( 2300 – 2482 ) were made at 318 K and pH 6 . 0 using standard 3D triple - resonance experiments ( 18 ) . Resonance assignments obtained at 318 K were transferred to spectra of a longer talin USH - I / LWEQ construct ( 2300 – 2501 ) at 305 K using standard 3D triple - resonance experiments ( 40 ) . NMR chemical shift perturbations in spectra recorded at different pH values were classiﬁed according to chemical shift changes as medium ( orange , (cid:6) (cid:2) TOT (cid:4) 0 . 05 – 0 . 1 ppm ) and large ( red , (cid:6) (cid:2) TOT (cid:1) 0 . 1 ppm ) , were weighted according to (cid:6) (cid:2) TOT (cid:4) (cid:1) (cid:6) 1 H (cid:1) (cid:7) (cid:1) (cid:6) 15 N (cid:1) (cid:8) 0 . 2 ( 41 ) .
