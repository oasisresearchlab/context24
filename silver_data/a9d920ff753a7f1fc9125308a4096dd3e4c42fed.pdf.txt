The Appropriate Test for a U - Shaped Relationship * Jo Thori Lind and Halvor Mehlum Department of Economics , University of Oslo , PB 1095 Blindern , 0317 Oslo , Norway ( e - mail : j . t . lind @ econ . uio . no ; halvor . mehlum @ econ . uio ) Abstract Nonlinear relationships are common in economic theory , and such relationships are also frequently tested empirically . We argue that the usual test of nonlinear relation - ships is ﬂ awed and derive the appropriate test for a U - shaped relationship . Our test gives the exact necessary and suf ﬁ cient conditions for the test of a U shape in ﬁ nite samples in a large class of models . I . Introduction Economics is full of humps and U’s . Famous examples of non - monotone relation - ships are the ‘Laffer curve’ , the ‘Kuznets curve ( an inverted U between income and inequality , Kuznets , 1955 ) , and the ‘Environmental Kuznets curve’ ( inverted U between income and pollution , Selden and Song , 1994 ; Grossman and Krueger , 1995 ) . In growth theory , poverty traps are generated if the growth rate of per capita capital stock ﬁ rst increases and then decreases with income ( Nelson , 1956 ) . In industrial organization it has been found that innovation is most intense at intermediate levels of competition ( Aghion et al . , 2005 ) . In political science , a ﬁ nding is that countries with an intermediate level of democracy are more prone to war compared with both dictatorships and democracies ( Hegre et al . , 2001 ) . Finally , it has been argued that there is a hump - shaped relationship between union bargaining centralization and wage growth ( Calmfors and Drif ﬁ ll , 1988 ) , although few econometric studies of this exist , mostly as a result of the scarcity of data . * While carrying out this research , the authors have been associated with the ESOPcentre at the Department of Economics , University of Oslo .

The debates take many forms and take issues with conceptual , empirical , and theoretical problems . There is one important common empirical question , however , that to the best of our knowledge has not been explicitly addressed anywhere in this diverse literature : namely , given the estimates of a regression model , what is the test at some level (cid:2) of the presence of a U shape ? In most empirical work trying to identify U shapes , the researcher includes a nonlinear ( usually quadratic ) term in an otherwise standard regression model . If this term is signi ﬁ cant and , in addition , the estimated extremum point is within the data range , it is common to conclude that there is a U - shaped relationship . We argue in this paper that this criterion is too weak . The problem arises when the true relationship is convex but monotone over relevant data values . A quadratic speci ﬁ cation may then erroneously yield an extreme point and hence a U shape . To test properly for the presence of a U shape on some interval of values , we need to test whether the relationship is decreasing at low values within this interval and increasing at high values within the interval . As the distribution of the estimated slope at any point is readily available , a test for the sign of the slope at any given point is straightforward . A test for a U shape gets more involved , however , as the null hypoth - esis is that the relationship is increasing at the left - hand side of the interval and / or is decreasing at the right - hand side . For this composite null hypothesis , standard testing methodology is no longer suitable . Fortunately , a general framework for such tests has been developed by Sasabuchi ( 1980 ) . 1 We adopt his general framework to test for the presence of a U - shaped relationship . The extension to an inverse U shape is of course trivial . Since 2001 , there have been seven articles in the American Economic Review that use regression techniques to identify a U shape or an inverted U shape in their data . All of these revert to criteria that are intuitively sound , but potentially misleading . In this paper , we will present the appropriate test and then contrast it to the tests employed by the seven articles . In addition we provide a detailed example of the test in the case of a Kuznets curve . II . A test of a U shape To allow the regression to have a U shape , the standard approach has been to include a quadratic or an inverse term in a linear model . A more general formulation is : y i = (cid:2) + (cid:3) x i + (cid:4) f ( x i ) + (cid:5) (cid:2) z i + (cid:6) i , i = 1 , . . . , n . ( 1 ) Here x is the explanatory variable of main interest ( e . g . income ) whereas y is the variable to be explained ( e . g . inequality ) , (cid:6) is an error term , and z is a vector of control variables . The known function f gives equation ( 1 ) a curvature and , depending on the 1 Surprisingly , this contribution has so far not been applied in the econometrics literature with the exception of a few studies of economic inequality starting with Dardanoni and Forcina ( 1999 ) . © Blackwell Publishing Ltd and the Department of Economics , University of Oxford 2009 Practitioners’ corner 111 parameters (cid:4) and (cid:3) , equation ( 1 ) may be U - shaped or not . We assume that f is chosen so that the relationship has at most one extreme point . In that case the relationship is either hump - shaped , U - shaped , or monotone . In the following we focus on the case of testing for a U shape . 2 Given equation ( 1 ) and the assumption of only one extreme point , the requirement for a U shape is that the slope of the curve is negative at the start and positive at the end of a reasonably chosen interval of x - values [ x l , x h ] . The natural choice of interval is in many contexts the observed data range [ min ( x ) , max ( x ) ] . If we want to make sure that the inverse U shape is not only a marginal phenomenon the interval could also be in the interior of the domain of x . To assure at most one extreme point on [ x l , x h ] , as assumed before , we require f (cid:2) to be monotone on this interval . A U shape is then implied by the conditions (cid:3) + (cid:4) f (cid:2) ( x l ) < 0 < (cid:3) + (cid:4) f (cid:2) ( x h ) . ( 2 ) If either of these inequalities are violated the curve is not U - shaped but inversely U - shaped or monotone . To test whether the conditions in equation ( 2 ) are supported by the data , we need to test whether the combined null hypothesis H 0 : (cid:3) + (cid:4) f (cid:2) ( x l ) ≥ 0 and / or (cid:3) + (cid:4) f (cid:2) ( x h ) ≤ 0 ( 3 ) can be rejected in favour of the combined alternative hypothesis H 1 : (cid:3) + (cid:4) f (cid:2) ( x l ) < 0 and (cid:3) + (cid:4) f (cid:2) ( x h ) > 0 . ( 4 ) Owing to the linearity of the speci ﬁ cation ( 1 ) with respect to (cid:3) and (cid:4) , the test of equation ( 3 ) vs . equation ( 4 ) is simply a test of linear restrictions on (cid:3) and (cid:4) . The dif ﬁ culty is that the test involves a set of inequality constraints . Hence the set of ( (cid:3) , (cid:4) ) that satisfy H 1 is a sector in R 2 contained between the two lines (cid:3) + (cid:4) f (cid:2) ( x l ) = 0 and (cid:3) + (cid:4) f (cid:2) ( x h ) = 0 . The test Assuming that (cid:6) i ∼ NID ( 0 , (cid:7) 2 ) , Sasabuchi ( 1980 ) shows that a test of H 0 in equation ( 3 ) based on the likelihood ratio principle takes the form Reject H 0 at the (cid:2) level of con ﬁ dence only if either , H L 0 or H H 0 or both can be rejected at the (cid:2) level of con ﬁ dence , where H L 0 and H H 0 are the null hypotheses in the two standard one - sided tests H L 0 : (cid:3) + (cid:4) f (cid:2) ( x l ) ≥ 0 vs . H L 1 : (cid:3) + (cid:4) f (cid:2) ( x l ) < 0 , H H 0 : (cid:3) + (cid:4) f (cid:2) ( x h ) ≤ 0 vs . H H 1 : (cid:3) + (cid:4) f (cid:2) ( x h ) > 0 . 2 The test for an inverse U is achieved by changing the sign on y . © Blackwell Publishing Ltd and the Department of Economics , University of Oxford 2009 112 Bulletin The rejection area is the convex cone R (cid:2) = (cid:2) ( (cid:3) , (cid:4) ) : (cid:3) + (cid:4) f (cid:2) ( x l ) (cid:3) s 11 + 2 f (cid:2) ( x l ) s 12 + f (cid:2) ( x l ) 2 s 22 < − t (cid:2) and (cid:3) + (cid:4) f (cid:2) ( x h ) (cid:3) s 11 + 2 f (cid:2) ( x h ) s 12 + f (cid:2) ( x h ) 2 s 22 > t (cid:2) (cid:4) , ( 5 ) where s 11 , s 22 and s 12 are the estimated variances of (cid:3) and (cid:4) and the covariance between them , whereas t (cid:2) is the (cid:2) - level tail probability of the t - distribution with the appropriate degrees of freedom . The test shown is also known as an intersection – union test as the null hypothesis is that the parameter vector is contained in a union of speci ﬁ ed sets ( see , e . g . Casella and Berger , 2002 , ch . 8 . 2 . 3 ) . Berger ( 1997 ) discusses the relationship between like - lihood ratio tests and intersection – union tests and the conditions under which they coincide . The two most common speci ﬁ cations of equation ( 1 ) is the quadratic form y i = (cid:2) + (cid:3) x i + (cid:4) x 2 i + (cid:5) (cid:2) z i + (cid:6) i ( 6 ) and the inverse form y i = (cid:2) + (cid:3) x i + (cid:4) x − 1 i + (cid:5) (cid:2) z i + (cid:6) i . ( 7 ) In the ﬁ rst case , the presence of a U implies (cid:3) + 2 (cid:4) x l < 0 and (cid:3) + 2 (cid:4) x h > 0 . A U shape in the second implies (cid:3) − (cid:4) x − 2 l < 0 and (cid:3) − (cid:4) x − 2 h > 0 . In both cases , the test is easily carried out as two ordinary t - tests . 3 The rejection area R (cid:2) can be manipulated so that it is expressed in terms of f (cid:2) ( x l ) and f (cid:2) ( x h ) . Solving for f (cid:2) ( x l ) and f (cid:2) ( x h ) in R (cid:2) and inserting for ( ˆ (cid:3) , ˆ (cid:4) ) yields the following two criteria for rejection : f (cid:2) ( x l ) < ˆ (cid:8) l ≡ s 12 t 2 (cid:2) − ˆ (cid:3) ˆ (cid:4) − t (cid:2) (cid:5) ( s 212 − s 22 s 11 ) t 2 (cid:2) + ˆ (cid:4) 2 s 11 + ˆ (cid:3) 2 s 22 − 2 s 12 ˆ (cid:3) ˆ (cid:4) ˆ (cid:4) 2 − s 22 t 2 (cid:2) , ( 8 ) f (cid:2) ( x h ) > ˆ (cid:8) h ≡ s 12 t 2 (cid:2) − ˆ (cid:3) ˆ (cid:4) + t (cid:2) (cid:5) ( s 212 − s 22 s 11 ) t 2 (cid:2) + ˆ (cid:4) 2 s 11 + ˆ (cid:3) 2 s 22 − 2 s 12 ˆ (cid:3) ˆ (cid:4) ˆ (cid:4) 2 − s 22 t 2 (cid:2) . ( 9 ) Here ˆ (cid:8) l and ˆ (cid:8) h are the roots of the same quadratic equation . This way of formulating the criterion has a good parallel to the work of Fieller ( 1954 ) . From his work , it is known how to construct an exact con ﬁ dence interval for the ratio of two normally distributed estimates . Note ﬁ rst that the estimated extreme point of equation ( 1 ) is 3 A routine to perform the test in these two cases in the software package Stata is available from : http : / / ideas . repec . org / c / boc / bocode / s456874 . html . © Blackwell Publishing Ltd and the Department of Economics , University of Oxford 2009 Practitioners’ corner 113 f (cid:2) ( ˆ x min ) = − ˆ (cid:3) ˆ (cid:4) . Following Fieller ( 1954 ) , a ( 1 − 2 (cid:2) ) con ﬁ dence interval for − (cid:3) / (cid:4) is given by [ ˆ (cid:8) l , ˆ (cid:8) h ] as de ﬁ ned in equations ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) . Therefore , a ( 1 − 2 (cid:2) ) con ﬁ dence interval for ˆ x min is [ ˜ x l , ˜ x h ] where f (cid:2) ( ˜ x i ) = ˆ (cid:8) i . To perform the test of equation ( 3 ) vs . equation ( 4 ) at the (cid:2) - level of signi ﬁ cance is then equivalent to seeing whether the ( 1 − 2 (cid:2) ) con ﬁ dence interval for ˆ x min is inside the data range , [ ˜ x l , ˜ x h ] ⊂ [ x l , x h ] . To ﬁ nd a con ﬁ dence interval for ˆ x min , one could also use the delta method . For ﬁ nite samples , however , this may be severely biased . 4 Also when using the delta method the ( 1 − 2 (cid:2) ) interval is the proper interval to use when testing for a U shape at the (cid:2) - level . The testing strategy is easily carried over to more involved estimations . First , it is readily extended to a more general formulation like y i = (cid:2) + (cid:6) Hj = 1 (cid:3) j f j ( x ) + z (cid:2) i (cid:4) + (cid:6) i , where f j is a set of known functions . 5 The appropriate test of the presence of an inverse U - shaped relationship between x and y is now H 0 : (cid:7) (cid:3) j f (cid:2) j ( x l ) ≤ 0 and / or (cid:7) (cid:3) j f (cid:2) j ( x h ) ≥ 0 vs . H 1 : (cid:7) (cid:3) j f (cid:2) j ( x l ) > 0 and (cid:7) (cid:3) j f (cid:2) j ( x h ) < 0 . ( 10 ) The test is also applicable to studies of U - shaped relationships in the full class of generalized linear models , encompassing most models of limited dependent variables . As the estimated parameters are asymptotically jointly normally distributed , the distribution of the test is asymptotic as explained before . Performance of the test To see the performance of the test , Table 1 shows the results of some Monte Carlo analyses . Two speci ﬁ cations are employed . First , data are generated with x ∼ U [ 0 , 1 ] , (cid:6) ∼ N ( 0 , 1 / 2 ) and y = a + bx + x 2 + (cid:6) , where b is chosen to achieve the desired minimum ranging from 0 . 6 to 1 . 6 . We then regress y on x and x 2 and perform three tests : ( i ) whether the quadratic term is signi ﬁ cant ; ( ii ) whether the quadratic term is signi ﬁ cant and the estimated extremum point is in [ 0 , 1 ] ; and ( iii ) the test described before . The table gives the fraction of cases where we reject the absence of a U - shaped 4 This problem is clearly illustrated in Hirschberg and Lye ( 2005 ) who study different methods for construct - ing ( 1 − (cid:2) ) intervals for the extremum of a quadratic equation and give practical recommendations consistent with our suggestions . 5 The dif ﬁ culty with this general speci ﬁ cation is that although the relationship is decreasing at the left - hand side of the relevant interval and increasing at the right - hand side , it may not be a U - shaped relationship inside , but instead for instance an W - shaped relationship . It is then necessary to perform a joint test of the whole shape of the relationship , which is much more complicated .

Results are based on 10 , 000 simulations . The tests studied are : ( i ) whether the quadratic term is signi ﬁ cant ; ( ii ) whether the quadratic term is signi ﬁ cant and the estimated extremum point is in [ 0 , 1 ] ; and ( iii ) the test described previously . relationship . To see how the different tests perform in a mis - speci ﬁ ed model , the right - hand part of the table shows simulations from a true model y = a + bx + 1 / x + (cid:6) , but where we still regress y on x and x 2 . Now we have 6 x ∼ U [ 0 . 5 ; 1 ] and (cid:6) ∼ N ( 0 , 1 / 2 ) . In the correctly speci ﬁ ed model , test ( i ) has a huge rate of Type I errors , erroneously rejecting the absence of a U - shaped relationship . This indicates that this is an inappropriate test . When it is also required that the estimated extremum be in the relevant interval as in ( ii ) , the test is stronger , particularly for large samples where this point estimate becomes precise . However , the proper test ( iii ) performs better in all cases . Notice , though , that it has somewhat lower test power than test ( ii ) when there actually is a U - shaped relationship . In the mis - speci ﬁ ed model , both tests ( i ) and ( ii ) perform badly . There is some excess probability of committing Type I errors for our test as well , but the outcomes are much better than the commonly used procedures . 6 The smaller interval for x was chosen as the asymptote y → + ∞ when x → 0 would have a too large impact on the estimates if x was allowed to be too small . In this case , all three procedures perform badly ( results available upon request ) . © Blackwell Publishing Ltd and the Department of Economics , University of Oxford 2009 Practitioners’ corner 115 III . A comparison with applied work We have read through a large number of applied econometrics works where U shapes are identi ﬁ ed using equation ( 6 ) . Most authors focus on the signi ﬁ cance and sign of both ˆ (cid:3) and ˆ (cid:4) . How does the signi ﬁ cance of these parameters relate to the test in equation ( 5 ) ? If the data range is the whole of R the signi ﬁ cance of ˆ (cid:4) ( with right sign ) is necessary and suf ﬁ cient for rejecting H 0 . If the data range is any subset of R , the signi ﬁ cance of ˆ (cid:4) is still necessary but not suf ﬁ cient . If the data range is exactly R + or R − the signi ﬁ cance ( with the right sign ) of ˆ (cid:3) and ˆ (cid:4) respectively is necessary and suf ﬁ cient for rejecting H 0 . If the data range is a subset of R + ( or of R − ) the individual signi ﬁ cance of both ˆ (cid:3) and ˆ (cid:4) is necessary but not suf ﬁ cient . If the data range is neither R , R + or R − , the necessary and suf ﬁ cient conditions are only found using equation ( 5 ) . Obviously , a simple ﬁ rst check is whether the estimated minimum point ( ˆ x min = − ˆ (cid:3) / ( 2ˆ (cid:4) ) ) itself is within the date range . Most works use the criterion that if both ˆ (cid:3) and ˆ (cid:4) are signi ﬁ cant and if the implied extreme point is within the data range , they have found a U . This is a sensible criterion but it is neither suf ﬁ cient nor necessary . It is insuf ﬁ cient as the estimated extreme point may be too close , given the uncertainty , to an end point of the data range . It is not generally necessary as (cid:3) may be zero if the data range extends to both sides of x = 0 . A small number of works use the delta method to calculate the standard deviation of the extreme point . This method , although sound , is only reliable with a suf ﬁ ciently large number of observations . We have in particular looked at articles in the American Economic Review . There are seven articles since 2001 that use regression techniques to identify a U shape . All use formulations similar to equation ( 6 ) . The most common procedure is the one followed by Abiad and Mody ( 2006 ) , McKinnish ( 2004 ) , and Kalemli - Ozcan , Sørensen and Yosha ( 2003 ) . They ﬁ nd that both ˆ (cid:3) and ˆ (cid:4) in the quadratic speci ﬁ cation have the right sign and are individually signi ﬁ cant . Based on this , they all conclude that they have found an inverted U shape without checking whether the implied extreme point is within any relevant range . Sigman ( 2002 ) follows the same procedure , but she also calculates the extreme point and ﬁ nds it to be within the data range . She writes , relating to ˆ (cid:3) and ˆ (cid:4) ( p . 1157 ) : ‘The GDP coef ﬁ cients always appear to follow an inverted U shaped pattern , but are jointly statistically signi ﬁ cant at 5 percent only in columns ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) ’ . Her testing for joint signi ﬁ cance of ˆ (cid:3) and ˆ (cid:4) , however , do not add much when looking for a U shape . As we have argued before , the signi ﬁ cance of ˆ (cid:4) alone is always a necessary condition in the test of a U shape . Similarly , Aghion et al . ( 2005 ) use their estimates from the quadratic speci ﬁ ca - tion to calculate predicted value ˆ y . They ﬁ nd that the estimated minimum is inside the x - range , but they do not explicitly assess the signi ﬁ cance of the result . Carr , Markusen and Maskus ( 2001 ) only include (cid:4) x 2 , and not (cid:3) x , in their speci ﬁ - cation . As their x - range includes both negative and positive values , their speci ﬁ cation © Blackwell Publishing Ltd and the Department of Economics , University of Oxford 2009 116 Bulletin rules out monotonically increasing or decreasing relationships between x and y . Hence their analysis does not allow for any meaningful test of a U shape against a monotone relationship . Imbs and Wacziarg ( 2003 ) ﬁ rst use non - parametric techniques to ﬁ nd the relationship between per capita income x and sectoral concentration y and they ﬁ nd a U shape . They use this technique also to construct 95 % intervals for the minimum point . They then turn to a parametric speci ﬁ cation with x and x 2 in the right - hand side . Both coef ﬁ cients have the right sign and are individually signi ﬁ cant . The signi ﬁ cance of the U shape is assessed by plotting x and ˆ y vs . the scatter plot of the data . The regression curve ﬁ ts the data very well and based on the plot alone one can safely conclude that the U shape is signi ﬁ cant at all conventional levels . But , the precise signi ﬁ cance level is unclear and so is the precision of the estimated minimum point . IV . Illustration As a concrete illustration of our methodology , we use a recent study by Chambers ( 2007 ) . The paper contains a standard Kuznets regression between gross domestic product ( GDP ) and inequality . The data are an unbalanced panel of 29 countries giving a total of 232 observations . He has information on the level of inequality measured by the Gini coef ﬁ cient , log of purchasing power parity adjusted GDP per capita , and a set of control variables ( see Chambers , 2007 , for details ) . We replicate and extend his analysis . Results from the regression analysis , test statistics from the appropriate U test , and the derived Fieller interval are reported in Table 2 . The conventional method would simply test the signi ﬁ cance of ˆ (cid:3) and ˆ (cid:4) , which TABLE 2 Estimates of the Kuznets curve Dependent variable : Gini index log per capita GDP ( X i ) ˆ (cid:3) = 32 . 27 ( 11 . 63 ) ÅÅÅ log per capita GDP - squared ( X 2 i ) ˆ (cid:4) = − 1 . 88 ( 0 . 65 ) ÅÅÅ Slope at X l ˆ (cid:3) + 2ˆ (cid:4) X l = 8 . 15 ( 3 . 65 ) ÅÅ Slope at X h ˆ (cid:3) + 2ˆ (cid:4) X h = − 4 . 33 ( 2 . 34 ) Å Appropriate U test 1 . 85 [ 0 . 033 ] Extremum point − ˆ (cid:3) / ( 2 ˆ (cid:4) ) = 8 . 60 90 % con ﬁ dence interval , Fieller method [ 7 . 44 , 9 . 58 ] 90 % con ﬁ dence interval , Delta method [ 7 . 73 , 9 . 47 ] Notes : Robust standard errors in parentheses and P - values in square brackets . * * * , * * and * denote signi ﬁ cances at the 1 , 5 , and 10 % levels .

Figure 1 illustrates the estimated relationship , the con ﬁ dence interval for the maxi - mum and the two lower bounds on the slopes in each endpoint . 7 We see that the turning point of the relationship is quite close to x h , and that the slope of the curve at x h is negative , but not very steep and only just signi ﬁ cant at the 5 % level . Hence there is a signi ﬁ cant hump - shaped relationship over the range of the data , but the signi ﬁ cance of this relationship is weaker than what would be detected by traditional approaches . V . Conclusion In this paper , we have provided an appropriate test of a U - shaped relationship in a regression model . In the applied econometrics literature a large number of articles try to identify non - monotone relationships using regression analysis . Any of these articles hardly use the adequate formal procedures when they test for the presence of a U shape . To the best of our knowledge none of them have used the simple test that we are suggesting . Most works , nevertheless , seem to be on fairly safe ground when they claim to have found a U shape . The reason is that the de facto common practice seems to be to check two necessary conditions , namely that the second derivative has the right sign and that the extremum point is within the data range . However , only the results from the former are usually reported . This criterion will be misleading , however , if the estimated extremum point is too close to the end point of the data range . Our test gives the exact necessary and suf ﬁ cient conditions for the test of a U shape . In addition , the interval interpretation provides a con ﬁ dence interval for the extremum point .
