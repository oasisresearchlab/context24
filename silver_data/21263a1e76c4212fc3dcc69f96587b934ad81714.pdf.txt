Cheke 4 , 5 * Abstract By 31 May 2022 , original / Alpha , Delta and Omicron strains induced 101 outbreaks of COVID - 19 in mainland China . Most outbreaks were cleared by combining non - pharmaceutical interventions ( NPIs ) with vaccines , but continuous virus variations challenged the dynamic zero - case policy ( DZCP ) , posing questions of what are the prerequisites and threshold levels for success ? And what are the independent effects of vaccination in each outbreak ? Using a modified classic infectious disease dynamic model and an iterative relationship for new infections per day , the effectiveness of vaccines and NPIs was deduced , from which the independent effectiveness of vaccines was derived . There was a negative correlation between vaccination coverage rates and virus transmission . For the Delta strain , a 61 . 8 % increase in the vaccination rate ( VR ) reduced the control reproduction number ( CRN ) by about 27 % . For the Omicron strain , a 20 . 43 % increase in VR , including booster shots , reduced the CRN by 42 . 16 % . The implementation speed of NPIs against the original / Alpha strain was faster than the virus’s transmission speed , and vaccines significantly accelerated the DZCP against the Delta strain . The CRN ( R c 1 ) during the exponential growth phase and the peak time and intensity of NPIs were key factors affecting a comprehensive theoretical threshold condition for DZCP success , illustrated by contour diagrams for the CRN under different conditions . The DZCP maintained the R c 1 of 101 outbreaks below the safe threshold level , but the strength of NPIs was close to saturation especially for Omicron , and there was little room for improvement . Only by curbing the rise in the early stage and shortening the exponential growth period could clearing be achieved quickly . Strengthening China’s vaccine immune barrier can improve China’s ability to prevent and control epidemics and provide greater scope for the selection and adjustment of NPIs . Otherwise , there will be rapid rises in infection rates and an extremely high peak and huge pressure on the healthcare system , and a potential increase in excess mortality .

BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 1084 Introduction During past three years of the COVID - 19 pandemic , prevention and control strategies in China have been changed from containment in the early stage to the dynamic zero - case policy ( DZCP ) , and then to almost complete re - opening recently [ 1 – 3 ] . Before November 2022 , China’s epidemic prevention strategy was mainly to implement a rapid DZCP through locking down cities , large - scale and almost complete coverage of tests with nucleic acid screening , close contact tracking and isola - tion , and improving vaccine coverage . By combining the above strong non - pharmaceutical interventions ( NPIs ) with vaccines , before 31 May 2022 , 101 outbreaks of spa - tially concentrated COVID - 19 infections caused by the original / Alpha strain and Delta and Omicron mutant strains in China were quickly and dynamically cleared ( Fig . 1a ) [ 4 ] . Due to the sensitive monitoring system , each outbreak was detected in its early initial stage fol - lowed by early isolation and treatment measures . Con - sequently , outbreak areas were locked down or partially locked down quickly , and then continuous nucleic acid screening was carried out for all personnel until the goal Fig . 1 101 epidemic waves in mainland China and data analyses . a Time series of 101 epidemic waves ( from 1 Jan 2020 to 31 May 2022 ) in mainland China caused by the original / Alpha , Delta and Omicron strains , with three large - scale outbreaks including those in Hubei , Shanghai and Jilin individually marked ; b The mean peak values and durations of clearing times of 101 epidemic waves for different virus strains . When calculating the average value of the peak value , we excluded the data for five Provinces and cities exceeding 500 due to the peak values of these five provinces being significantly higher than those of other provinces , identified as outliers by Boxplot , namely 14 , 840 in Hubei ( original / Alpha , 13 February 2020 ) , 27 , 605 in Shanghai ( Omicron , 13 April 2022 ) , 555 in Shandong ( Omicron , 11 March 2022 ) , 4427 in Jilin ( Omicron , 2 April 2022 ) and 555 in Hebei ( Omicron , 19 March 2022 ) . c Four stages of the epidemics including the free rising period with regular epidemic NPIs ( τ 1 ) , containment exponential growth period ( τ 2 ) , plateau period ( τ 3 ) and exponential decline period ( τ 4 ) . The duration of clearing times ( T c = τ 1 + τ 2 + τ 3 + τ 4 ) can be calculated from the real time series and the theoretical formula given in the Methods ( Extended Data Online content ) Page 3 of 12 Tang et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 1084 of zero clearance was achieved , resulting in nearly 100 % close contact tracking , isolation and nucleic acid screen - ing rates within a short period , otherwise the DZCP strategy could not have been realized so quickly for each outbreak . However , due to the characteristics of the Omicron virus such as its high infectivity and low pathogenicity , China has adjusted its prevention and control measures after implementing the DZCP for nearly three years . Notably , “20 measures” were announced on 11 November 2022 which included reduced isolation periods , the stop - ping of mass testing except when a source of infection was known , relaxing travel restrictions and associated testing , boosting healthcare resources and stockpiling medicines , followed by a further “10 new measures” on 7 December 2022 [ 5 , 6 ] . These mainly allowed people with mild or asymptomatic infections to be quarantined at home and reduced the frequency of nucleic acid test - ing , according to a statement issued by the State Coun - cil’s Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism . Also , since 8 January 2023 Covid - 19 has been down - graded from a Category A to a Category B disease http : / / www . nhc . gov . cn / xcs / zheng cwj / 202301 / bdc1f f75fe b9493 4ae1d ade17 6d309 36 . shtml . Since then , Omicron infections have spread rapidly in major cities including Beijing , Shanghai , Chongqing and Chengdu where the Omicron epidemics have been putting severe pressure on the healthcare sys - tem since late December 2022 [ 7 , 8 ] . Compared with each outbreak wave before and after the policy adjustment , we found that before the adjust - ment , the goal of DZCP could be achieved in a rela - tively short time , the peak time of each wave was very short and the peak numbers of infections and final sizes of outbreaks were very small . After the adjustment , not only is it impossible to achieve the goal of the DZCP , but also the epidemic situation in various regions reaches a peak quickly with a huge peak value . Therefore , we can infer that there is a threshold for the intensity of NPIs to achieve the goal of dynamic zeroing . The key problem is how to determine this threshold and the extent that the independent effect of the vaccine has played in the pro - cess of dynamic zeroing for each outbreak . Answering the above two questions can provide important deci - sion - making guidance for the prevention and control of COVID - 19 or the adjustment of prevention and control policies for new emerging infectious diseases . Methods Data collection and statistical analyses We obtained data on laboratory - confirmed COVID - 19 cases in China from the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China ( http : / / www . nhc . gov . cn / xcs / xxgzbd / gzbd _ index . shtml ) , as shown in Fig . 1a [ 4 ] . As of 31 May 2022 , there had been 101 outbreaks of the COVID - 19 epidemic in China , including 39 outbreaks of the original / Alpha strain , 19 outbreaks of the Delta strain and 43 outbreaks of the Omicron strain . If the number of newly reported cases was zero for three consecutive days , we considered that the epidemic had been dynami - cally cleared , and small - scale epidemics with peak values of less than or equal to 10 were not counted in the 101 epidemic waves ( each wave had a peak with a peak value ) . Moreover , in the 101 outbreaks few or no COVID - related deaths were reported , except for during the first outbreak of the Wuhan epidemic induced by the original Alpha strain and during the Shanghai epidemic induced by the Omicron strain . Therefore , we did not collect the num - bers of daily reported deaths for the 101 outbreaks in this study . Powerful and high - frequency nucleic acid detec - tion in China made it impossible to accurately distin - guish between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients because infected people were detected in time at an early stage , and consequently there was almost no under - reporting of cases . The outbreak of the Delta strain started on 21 May 2021 in Guangdong , and the outbreak of the Omicron strain started on 8 January 2022 in Tianjin . We collected the numbers of daily reported cases for these 101 outbreaks from the National Health Commission . Using the maxi - mum number of newly reported cases per day in each out - break , the mean peak value during the epidemic period of each virus strain can be calculated ( Fig . 1 , Supplementary materials : Extended Data Fig . 1 ) . In addition , no matter what kind of virus strain induced each wave , the dynamic zero - case policy ( DZCP ) [ 1 – 3 ] could be achieved within about 40 days , and consequently we denote the duration of each outbreak as the clearing duration . The mean value of the clearing duration can be calculated directly by using the duration of each wave . As a result , the average peaks were 44 . 34 , 47 . 68 and 73 . 72 cases and the average durations were 31 . 23 , 22 . 52 and 45 . 25 days for outbreaks caused by the Alpha , Delta and Omicron strains , respectively , ( Fig . 1b ) . It is noted that the data used to calculate the mean peak value do not include the five outbreaks with peaks greater than 500 , namely 14 , 840 ( Alpha , 13 February 2020 ) in Hubei , 27 , 605 ( Omicron , 13 April 2022 ) in Shanghai , 555 ( Omi - cron , 11 March 2022 ) in Shandong , 4427 ( Omicron , 2 April 2022 ) in Jilin and 555 ( Omicron , 19 March 2022 ) in Hebei . The peak values of these five provinces were significantly higher than those of other provinces and were identified as outliers by Boxplot . Besides , at the set research termina - tion time , there were still 7 outbreaks of the Omicron strain that had not ended . What we are faced with here is right - censored , for which the complete duration time has been cut off at the deadline . Therefore , we chose the Kaplan – Meier approach to estimate a survivor function and further Page 4 of 12 Tang et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 1084 calculated the mean survival time , which refers to the mean duration time here . The result of the survival analysis was 45 . 25 , and its 95 % confidence interval was ( 34 . 77 , 55 . 73 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . The 7 outbreaks have now ended so we also cal - culated the mean duration times for them as 44 . 30 , based on the real data , which verified the reliability of the survival analysis results . In addition to the numbers of daily reported cases , we also collected vaccination data , including the number of daily vaccination injections in some provinces of China from 15 December 2020 to 24 January 2022 ( Supplemen - tary materials : Extended Data Tables 1 and 2 ) . Thus , the vaccination ratio is defined as the ratio of the total num - ber of injections to the total population ( Supplementary materials : Extended Data Table 1 ) . Here , when calculat - ing the corresponding vaccination ratio for the epidemic caused by the Delta variant , we used the data on the total number of injections at the start of the epidemic . How - ever , due to the lack of later vaccination data ( the vac - cination data are as of 24 January 2022 ) , the vaccination ratio of the epidemic induced by the Omicron variant was calculated using the vaccination data on 24 January 2022 ( Supplementary materials : Extended Data Table 2 ) . Dynamic model With strict follow - up quarantine , isolation and treatment measures related to China’s DZCP , we employed a general Susceptible - Infected - Recovered ( SIR ) - type epidemiological model with contact tracing developed by Keeling & Rohani [ 9 ] , because all of the reported cases were treated in isola - tion , and the powerful NPIs effectively avoided the impact of the incubation period of each virus strain on the detected cases . Considering the close tracking and isolation meas - ures that were implemented in China , we divided the pop - ulation into the following groups of people : susceptible ( S ) , infected ( I ) , quarantined ( both susceptible and infected ) ( I q ) and recovered / confirmed ( R ) [ 4 ] . Let N be a constant to denote the total population , the transmission probabil - ity be β , contact rate be a constant c , quarantined rate be q and the confirmation rate of the quarantined infected people be δ q . 1 / γ represents the transmission period with various NPIs being effective . Here , it is assumed that the quarantined susceptible population ( I q ) will not return to the susceptible population before the dynamic zeroing of the epidemic due to strong NPIs and short epidemic dura - tion . The model is as follows : ( 1 ) S ′ = − ( β c + cq ( 1 − β ) ) N SI , I ′ = β c ( 1 − q ) N SI − γ I , S ′ q = ( 1 − β ) cq N SI , I ′ q = β cqN SI − δ q I q , R ′ = δ q I q + γ I . Note that dynamic zeroing for each wave could be achieved in about 40 days , and that the closely tracked and quarantined susceptible population gener - ally needs to be quarantined for two weeks in a cen - tralized manner and one week at home , so that the quarantined susceptible population will not become susceptible again at the end of a wave . We emphasize here that a SEIR model rather than a SIR model based on the transmission mechanism of COVID - 19 could be employed . However , due to the powerful high - fre - quency nucleic acid testing , most infected people will not have experienced a complete process from infec - tion to incubation period , and then to asymptomatic or symptomatic , i . e . every patient may be found at every stage after infection , and thus a SIR model ( 1 ) has been used here . Because of this , the epidemic data only include the number of newly reported confirmed cases . Of course , it would be possible to develop math - ematical models incorporating more practical factors , including age structure , and conduct more in - depth research [ 10 ] . As mentioned in the data analyses , our study excluded several outbreaks with more than 500 newly reported cases in a single day , and all outbreaks can be dynami - cally cleared in about 40 days . Therefore , compared with the total population size of each province or munici - pality ( at least tens of millions and at most hundreds of millions ) , the S / N ratio is basically 1 in the process of each outbreak under China’s powerful NPI strategy . For example , as of 31 May 2022 , the largest proportion of the total number of infected cases to the total population of each province was Shanghai ( 2 . 52 % ) , followed by Jilin ( 0 . 31 % ) , and Hubei ( 0 . 12 % ) , all of which were excluded from this study for the reasons explained above . The prevalence in the regions used in this study are shown in Extended Data Fig . 1 . Therefore , it is reasonable to assume that SN ≈ 1 always held during each outbreak in mainland China before the relaxation of control meas - ures , which results in : Let β 1 = ( β c + cq ( 1 − β ) ) , β 2 = β c ( 1 − q ) , β 3 = β cq , the control reproduction number ( CRN ) R c = β 2 γ , the basic reproduction number R 0 = β c γ , then β 3 = β cq = γ q 1 − q R c . Note that the R c is determined by the transmission probability β which is directly affected by the effectiveness of vaccines , contact rate c , quaran - tined rate q and the transmission period 1 / γ which are directly affected by the strength of NPIs . Solving the equation for I in ( 2 ) yields : ( 2 ) (cid:31) I ′ = β c ( 1 − q ) I − γ I = γ ( R c − 1 ) I , I q ′ = β cqI − δ q I q = γ q 1 − q R c I − δ q I q . Page 5 of 12 Tang et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 1084 Substituting Eq . ( 3 ) into the second equation of ( 2 ) , we have Taking the initial value as 0 and solving the above dif - ferential equation gives : It follows from Eq . ( 2 ) that the number of newly reported cases in the controlled area is γ q 1 − q R c I and the number of newly reported cases in the uncontrolled area is γ R c I . Note that due to very extensive and frequent nucleic acid testing , the total number of newly reported cases is exactly the total number of new infections . More - over , the total number of daily reported cases at time t can be calculated as follows : Furthermore , we have the following iteration formula for the number of daily reported cases : The iteration relation shown in ( 4 ) contains only two parameters , namely , the transmission period 1 γ and the CRN R c , which has involved the combined effect of NPIs and vaccine efficacy . This relationship is equivalent to the well - known one obtained for SIR models [ 11 ] . Further , we can consider γ ( R c − 1 ) as a whole in the iterative for - mula ( 4 ) with the exponential growth rate as the only parameter , which can provide useful information on characterizing the transmissibility . Estimation of the epidemic duration Based on the epidemic data and times for implement - ing NPIs for each outbreak , as shown in Fig . 1c , the dynamic zeroing process of each outbreak may experi - ence four distinct phases : ( 1 ) a free rising period with regular epidemic prevention and control ( τ 1 ) ; ( 2 ) a con - tainment rising period ( τ 2 ) ; ( 3 ) a plateau period ( τ 3 ) and ( 4 ) an exponentially declining period ( τ 4 ) . Note that the exponential growth period can be calculated as τ 1 + τ 2 , and with strong NPIs some of the outbreaks considered in this work have no plateau period and / or no free ris - ing period [ 1 – 3 ] . We used a linear regression model to describe the relationship between the logarithm of the number of daily reported cases ( y ) and the time t in the ( 3 ) I ( t ) = I 0 exp [ γ ( R c − 1 ) t ] . I q ′ = β 3 I 0 exp [ γ ( R c − 1 ) t ] − δ q I q . I q ( t ) = [ 𝛽 3 I 0 exp [ ( R c γ + 𝛿 q − γ ) t ] − 𝛽 3 I 0 R c γ + 𝛿 q − γ ] exp ( − 𝛿 q t ) . New ( t ) = γ q 1 − qR c I + γ R c I = γ 1 − qR c I = γ R c I 0 1 − q exp [ γ ( R c − 1 ) t ] . ( 4 ) New ( t + 1 ) = f ( New ( t ) ) = New ( t ) exp [ 𝛾 ( R c − 1 ) ] . exponential growth period and the exponential declining period , as follows : where r 1 ( or r 2 ) is the exponential growth ( or decline ) rate , b 1 ( b 2 ) is the intercept term . As is well known , the first confirmed case is often reported later than the onset of an epidemic . If the exponential growth rate of the num - ber of daily reported cases at the beginning of the epi - demic is assumed to be r 1 , the onset time of the epidemic can be calculated by y = 0 , namely t 0 = - b / r 1 . Suppose the reporting time of the first confirmed case is t 1 = 1 , then the free rising period can be determined to be This simple formula can deal well with the problem of reporting delay , and the free rising period for 6 epidem - ics induced by Omicron and for 4 epidemics induced by Delta strains based on Eq . ( 6 ) as shown in Extended Data Table 4 . The estimation of changing points The four distinct phases of each outbreak are deter - mined by three key switching points , and here an analyti - cal method to estimate these three switching points was employed [ 12 , 13 ] , to further identify the time nodes of each stage , determined on the basis of the actual data and adjustment of the prevention and control strategies . We used Bayes’s method to capture the transition time from the free rising stage to the containment stage , and the transition time from the containment stage to the plateau stage . Since the linear regression model ( 5 ) can well describe the change of the logarithmic value of the number of new cases , we introduced change points into the model and then estimated the change points based on the data . A posterior distribution expression of a single change point for a general switching linear model is avail - able [ 11 , 12 ] . By giving the prior information about the parameters , the times when the three phases switch can be obtained by sampling using the posterior distribution . The estimated switching points of the first three phases by sampling using the posterior distribution are given in the first three columns of Extended Data Table 4 . Calculation of the CRN With the strengthening of NPI measures , especially the improvement of detection , the infection period of undiagnosed patients was shortened . Therefore , for an infected individual , his / her transmission period is assumed to be 1 / γ 1 ( or 1 / γ 2 ) during the exponential ( 5 ) y = r i t + b i , i = 1 , 2 ( 6 ) τ 1 = t 1 − t 0 = b r 1 + 1 . Page 6 of 12 Tang et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 1084 growth ( or declining ) period of the outbreak , and the corresponding CRN is R c 1 ( or R c 2 ) . According to the iter - ative formula for the number of daily reported cases ( 4 ) , we can obtain the relationship between the exponential growth ( or decline ) rate and the CRN as follows : Thus , the CRN can be calculated from According to ( 7 ) , the value of the CRN depends on the value of r i and γ i . Here , considering that the value of the transmission period may affect the value of the CRN , we calculated R c 1 when the transmission period is 5 and 6 days , and R c 2 when the infection period is 1 and 2 days ( Supplementary materials : Extended Data Table 3 ) . In addition , the epidemic situation in Shanghai experienced three adjustments to its exponential growth rate ( 0 . 39 , 0 . 24 , 0 . 18 ) before reaching the plateau period . The val - ues of the CRN calculated by using the three exponential growth rates are , respectively , 3 . 34 , 2 . 44 and 2 . 08 ( or 2 . 95 , 2 . 20 , 1 . 90 ) when γ 1 = 1 / 6 ( or γ 1 = 1 / 5 ) , and the values given in Extended Data Tables 1 and 3 are the values for the first exponential growth stage . Estimation of epidemic duration Considering the four ( or three ) stages of each wave of the 101 epidemics , the role of all NPI measures is embodied in gradually reducing the exponential growth rate of the number of daily reported cases , and finally to less than 0 , that is , from exponential growth to exponential decline . In other words , the CRN is reduced from R c 1 to R c 2 due to the continuous strengthening of NPIs , so we can define the relatively strengthened NPIs in this process as S c , i . e . Thus , the threshold condition for disease control is R c 2 < 1 , namely Let T c be the clearing duration . Obviously , T c = τ 1 + τ 2 + τ 3 + τ 4 . Given the value of the NPI strength S c , we can get the influence of the exponential growth time τ 1 + τ 2 and the CRN R c 1 on the clearing duration T c . Specifically , assume that one infected indi - vidual is introduced into the population at time 0 , then the number of newly reported cases at time τ 1 + τ 2 gives : r i = γ i ( R ci − 1 ) , i = 1 , 2 . ( 7 ) R ci = r i γ i + 1 , i = 1 , 2 S c = R c 1 − R c 2 R c 1 . ( 8 ) S c > R c 1 − 1 R c 1 . New ( τ 1 + τ 2 ) = exp [ γ 1 ( R c 1 − 1 ) ( τ 1 + τ 2 ) ] . Because τ 3 is the duration of the plateau phase , the numbers of daily reported cases remain unchanged . Thus , we have It follows from New ( T c ) = New ( 𝜏 1 + 𝜏 2 + 𝜏 3 ) exp [ 𝛾 2 ( R c 2 − 1 ) ( T c − ( 𝜏 1 + 𝜏 2 + 𝜏 3 ) ) ] = 1 that Therefore , if condition ( 8 ) holds , the epidemic can then be eliminated , consequently the goal of dynamic zero - ing can be achieved . Thus , given the CRN ( R c 1 ) , we can estimate the clearing duration T c according to Eq . ( 9 ) under different exponential growth durations τ 1 + τ 2 and the relatively strengthened NPIs S c . Here , the dura - tion of the plateau phase is usually unpredictable , so we assume that τ 3 = 0 when calculating the epidemic dura - tion theoretically . Estimation of the relatively strengthened NPIs ( S c ) Define c 0 to be the average number of contacts before the outbreak which was 14 ( or 20 ) [ 14 ] . It is assumed that the number of contacts has been reduced by 1 / 3 , 1 / 2 or 2 / 3 in the exponential growth stage ( c 1 ) , that is , the aver - age numbers of contacts were 9 . 3 , 7 , 4 . 7 ( or 13 . 3 , 10 , 6 . 7 ) . It is assumed that the infection period in the exponen - tial growth stage is 6 days , and that in the exponential decline stage it is 2 days ( effects of these two parameters on the CRN are shown in Extended Data Table 3 ) . Then the infection period is reduced from 6 to 2 , and the CRN is reduced to 1 / 3 of its original value ( R c 1 ) . If the contact number is further reduced by another 1 / 3 , 1 / 2 or 2 / 3 , then the CRN is constrained to be 2 / 9 , 1 / 6 or 1 / 9 of its original value ( R c 1 ) . Thus , increasing the detection strength and controlling social distancing reduced the CRN by 78 % , 83 % or 89 % . The average contacts under different circum - stances are shown in Extended Data Table 6 . Obviously , the average contacts in bold are smaller than the average number of people in a Chinese family , which is impos - sible . In addition , the infection period of 2 days already limits the effect of NPI measures . Therefore , a reason - able setting is that the maximum mean of the relatively strengthened NPI S c is 0 . 89 . In Extended Data Table 7 , the sensitivity analyses of the CRNs and the relatively strengthened NPIs S c in the exponential decline stage for different 1 / γ 2 ( here we ﬁxed γ 1 = 1 / 7 ) are listed . Results The classic infectious disease dynamic model was used after modification and an iterative relationship for new infections per day was derived [ 9 ] , and then the New ( τ 1 + τ 2 + τ 3 ) = exp [ γ 1 ( R c 1 − 1 ) ( τ 1 + τ 2 ) ] ( 9 ) T c = ( 𝜏 1 + 𝜏 2 ) ( 1 + 𝛾 1 ( R c 1 − 1 ) 𝛾 2 ( 1 − R c 2 ) ) + 𝜏 3 ≜ g ( R c 1 , 𝜏 1 + 𝜏 2 , S c ) . Page 7 of 12 Tang et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 1084 effectiveness of vaccines and NPIs was deduced . Initially , we simulated the new infections with R 0 = 3 to calcu - late a theoretical simulation curve ( TSC , blue in Fig . 2a ) . Curve fitting ( red in Fig . 2a ) for the real data ( from 10 to 29 January 2020 ) resulted in R 0 = 3 . 82 for the origi - nal strain in Wuhan city , which is clearly higher than the blue curve [ 1 – 3 ] . It is known that the very limited abil - ity to detect the new coronavirus in early 2020 led to incomplete and late diagnoses of the initial cases which contributed to a serious underestimation of the transmis - sion risk of the original strain involved in the Wuhan epi - demic [ 15 – 17 ] . In 2021 , the numbers of newly reported cases caused by the Delta mutant in Shaanxi ( mainly in Xi’an city ) , Liaoning , Inner Mongolia , Fujian , Heilongjiang and Jiangsu Provinces ( Yanghzou city in Jiangsu ) were lower than their respective TSCs when R 0 = 6 ( Fig . 2b ) [ 16 ] . This shows that the combination of vaccinations and NPIs effectively curbed the exponential growth of the Delta mutant epidemic for the above six regions with R c 1 = 2 . 92 , 2 . 56 , 2 . 68 , 3 . 46 , 3 . 40 , 2 . 56 ( 4 . 0 for Yangzhou city ) respectively , and the vaccination ratios corre - sponding to each outbreak time ( number of doses / total population ) were 1 . 73 , 1 . 62 , 1 . 60 , 1 . 49 , 1 . 48 and 1 . 07 , respectively ( Supplementary materials : Extended Data Table 1 ) . A comparison between the epidemic caused by the Delta strain in Xi’an city with that in Yangzhou city in 2021 indicates that the 61 . 8 % increase in the vaccina - tion coverage rate in Shaanxi induced the 27 % reduction in the CRN , conditional upon a similar intensity of NPIs , Fig . 2 Analysis of synergistic and independent effects of vaccine and NPIs . a Comparison between the exponential growth curve obtained when the R 0 of the original variant is 3 ( blue curve ) and the exponential growth curve during the free rising period of the epidemic ( red curve ) in Wuhan , in 2020 . b Early relevant information on 6 outbreaks caused by the Delta mutant in Shaanxi , Liaoning and other places in China in 2021 ( for comparative purposes , data for Yangzhou City in Jiangsu Province are also provided ) , including vaccination rate ( proportion of total doses to total population ) and the control reproduction number ( CRN ) R c 1 . c The early relevant information on 9 outbreaks caused by the Omicron mutant in Hebei , Guangdong , Tianjin and other places in China in 2022 , including the vaccination rate ( by 28 January 2022 ) and the values of the CRN R c 1 . d Comparison of two outbreaks in Shaanxi and Liaoning caused by Delta and Omicron mutants in 2021 and 2022 indicates that even under stronger NPIs and higher vaccine coverage rate , the Omicron strain is more infectious in China . e Correlation analysis and linear regression between vaccination rate and R c 1 for 6 outbreaks caused by the Delta mutant .

BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 1084 that is , the independent protective effect of the vaccine is obvious given the consistent intensity of NPIs [ 18 , 19 ] . Since the Omicron mutant entered China in 2022 , it has caused small - scale epidemics in 7 provinces and cit - ies including Tianjin , Hebei and Guangdong , as well as large - scale epidemics in Jilin and Shanghai . The number of early infections increased exponentially , but at rates that were all far below the TSC for the Omicron strain with R 0 = 8 , as their R c 1 values were in the 2 . 14 – 3 . 70 range ( Fig . 2c , Supplementary materials : Extended Data Table 2 ) [ 20 ] . Similarly , comparing the epidemics caused by the Omicron strain in Guangdong Province with those in Jilin Province in 2022 indicates that the 42 . 16 % increase in vaccination coverage rate in Guangdong induced the 34 . 05 % reduction in CRN , which , together with vaccination coverage rates , implies that the booster shot for COVID - 19 is more effective to protect against the Omicron variant than against the Alpha or Delta variants . There is a strong negative correlation between the vaccination level and the CRN of COVID - 19 [ 21 – 24 ] . The higher the vaccination level , the lower the CRN of the epidemic ( Fig . 2d - f ) . By taking the COVID - 19 epidemics caused by the Alpha strain in Beijing , Hebei , Heilongjiang and Jilin as examples , we carried out a logarithmic analysis of the data in each region by using linear regression equations of different stages in each region to examine the inter - action between epidemic evolutions and the dynamic clearing process . During the Alpha epidemic period , the early exponential growth rates were very high ( the lin - ear growth slopes of the four regions were 1 . 3 , 1 . 02 , 1 . 23 and 0 . 49 , respectively ; Fig . 3a ) . Moreover , the exponen - tial growth trends of the four regions were cut off within five days . This shows that China’s quarantining of close contacts , rapid nucleic acid screening , locking down of residential communities with active transmissions and Fig . 3 Different stages of epidemic evolutions and the dynamic zeroing processes . Using linear regression lines to fit logarithmic data and growth curves to fit original data caused by the Alpha , Delta and Omicron variants , we analyzed the impact of NPI strategies on dynamic zeroing in four periods . The slope of the rising straight line reflects the severity and risk of the epidemic and the timeliness of the NPIs , and the slope of the falling straight line reflects the strength of the NPI measures . Subplots a , b and d represent the linear regression lines and logarithms of data on epidemics caused by the Alpha , Delta and Omicron variants . Subplots c and e represent fitting the original data caused by the Delta and Omicron variants , calculated from the linear regression results shown in subplots b and d ( Guangdong and Hebei provinces had slight rebounds during their decline periods , so there are two linear regression fitting curves for these declines ) Page 9 of 12 Tang et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 1084 imposing travel restrictions can effectively curb epidem - ics caused by virus strains with long incubation periods and low infectivity in a relatively short time . It also indi - cates that the speed of implementation of NPIs was faster than the transmission speed of the Alpha strain [ 3 , 25 ] . The early linear growth slopes of the Delta mutant causing COVID - 19 in Shaanxi , Jiangsu , Liaoning and Heilongjiang Provinces were 0 . 32 , 0 . 26 , 0 . 26 and 0 . 4 , respectively ( Fig . 3b ) . The epidemic data in Heilongji - ang Province grew the fastest in the early stage , but its free rising and containment rising periods were relatively short . In the later stage , the slopes of the linear declines were - 0 . 26 , - 0 . 27 , - 0 . 18 , - 0 . 29 , respectively ( Fig . 3b - c ) . The epidemic situation decreased rapidly , and the val - ues of R C 2 ( the estimated S c ) were 0 . 48 ( 0 . 84 ) , 0 . 46 ( 0 . 82 ) , 0 . 64 ( 0 . 75 ) and 0 . 42 ( 0 . 88 ) , respectively ( Supplementary materials : Extended Data Table 3 ) . These results show that Heilongjiang had the smallest R C 2 , the largest NPI efforts , and consequently the minimum clearing time ( Extended Data Table 4 ) . Thus , the strength of NPIs for the Delta virus - induced epidemic was very strong [ 26 ] , compared with the mean upper limit S c = 0 . 89 . In Jilin , Beijing , Shaanxi , Shanghai , Guangdong and Hebei , the early linear growth slopes of the epidemic induced by the Omicron strain were 0 . 45 , 0 . 34 , 0 . 4 , 0 . 39 , 0 . 19 and 0 . 36 , respectively ( Fig . 3d , Supplementary mate - rials : Extended Data Table 2 ) , among which Jilin was the fastest , while Guangdong was the slowest . According to the linear regression fitting results , the free rising period in Shanghai was 0 days , in Beijing and Hebei it was 2 days [ 27 , 28 ] , and in Guangdong and Shaanxi 3 days ( Sup - plementary materials : Extended Data Table 4 ) , indicat - ing that the epidemic situation in most areas was found earlier during Omicron epidemics than in those caused by other variants . Comparing Beijing and Jilin , Jilin was found relatively late , the initial growth rate of Beijing was slightly lower than that of Jilin , and the time to reach the plateau period was 3 days earlier than that for Jilin . Bei - jing quickly ended the containment period and entered the plateau period , resulting in a huge difference in the development of the epidemic between Beijing and Jilin in the later period ( Fig . 3e , Supplementary materials : Extended Data Table 4 ) . During the exponential decreasing stage , the val - ues of R C 2 ( S c ) were 0 . 62 ( 0 . 83 ) , 0 . 68 ( 0 . 78 ) , 0 . 56 ( 0 . 83 ) , 0 . 76 ( 0 . 77 ) , 0 . 36 ( 0 . 83 ) , 0 . 48 ( 0 . 85 ) in the above six regions , respectively ( Fig . 3d , Supplementary materials : Extended Data Table 3 ) , with Shanghai having the largest R C 2 and the smallest S c . Note that the slopes of the late linear decline phases of the epidemics induced by the Omicron strain were - 0 . 19 , - 0 . 16 , - 0 . 22 , - 0 . 12 , - 0 . 24 ( - 0 . 32 ) , - 0 . 16 ( - 0 . 26 ) . Two slopes are provided for both Guangdong and Hebei provinces due to slight rebounds that occurred during their decline periods ( Fig . 3d ) . Notice that Shang - hai had the slowest decline while Guangdong had the fastest decline . The biggest difference between these two is that Guangdong crossed the plateau period during a short containment of the rise , which rapidly declined . Thus , the scale of this round of the epidemic in Guang - dong was far smaller than that in Shanghai , and the clear - ing time after the decline was significantly faster than that in Shanghai , a difference of 65 days ( Supplementary materials : Extended Data Table 4 ) . The linear regression fitting completely reproduces the dynamic adjustment process of NPIs in Shanghai with five time points shown as red dots in Fig . 3d , making the slope of the straight line ( or R c 1 ) drop from 0 . 39 ( or 3 . 34 ) at the earliest to 0 . 18 ( or 2 . 08 ) in the rising containment period . It took 44 days to cut off the exponential growth and enter the plateau period with four step - by - step increments in the strength of NPIs , resulting in difficulties in dynamic zeroing in the later period . This emphasizes the importance of quick and intense responses , effectively shortening the expo - nential growth period . By comparing values of R C 2 for the epidemics induced by the Delta and Omicron strains we found that , with the same mean S c , the R c 2 for the epidemic associated with the Delta strain is relatively small , leading to dynamic zeroing being achieved fast [ 28 , 29 ] . Moreover , most Omicron - induced epidemics were cleared within rela - tively short times ( before 1 June 2022 , shown in Fig . 1a , Supplementary materials : Extended Data Table 2 ) , but took far longer to clear than epidemics induced by the Alpha and Delta strains . Therefore , all these results con - firm that China’s high vaccination rate and strong NPIs can effectively avoid various waves of epidemics induced by existing strains and achieve dynamic zeroing , but there are still great risks and uncertainties with small outbreaks during the declining stage due to prerequisites and threshold levels associated with dynamic zeroing ( Fig . 3d - e ) . In addition , the epidemic durations ( including the pla - teau phases ) for 6 epidemics induced by Omicron and for 4 epidemics induced by Delta strains based on Eq . ( 9 ) are shown in Extended Data Table 4 , while the real epi - demic durations for these 10 epidemics are shown in Extended Data Tables 1 and 2 . It should be noted here that when estimating the duration of an epidemic , we consider that the free rising period due to the first reported case for each epidemic inevitably has a certain lag . Thus , the general estimation result is slightly longer than the time series of real data . For example , for the epidemic situation in Liaoning ( Heilongjiang ) induced by the Delta strain , the estimated epidemic period was 36 days ( 23 days , Supplementary materials : Extended Data Table 4 ) . If the estimated free rising period of Page 10 of 12 Tang et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 1084 8 days ( 3 days ) is subtracted , it would have been 28 days ( 20 days ) , which is consistent with the reported duration of 24 days ( 20 days , Supplementary materials : Extended Data Table 1 ) . In addition , the epidemics in Guangdong and Hebei Provinces induced by the Omicron strain showed small fluctuations in the declining stage . In general , the reported durations of the epidemics were 97 and 76 days , respectively ( Supplementary materi - als : Extended Data Table 2 ) , with three peaks ( Fig . 3d - e ) . Specifically , the number of daily reported cases in Guangdong ( Hebei ) reached 0 on the 75th ( 47th ) day , and then increased when a third small peak appeared . When estimating the duration of an epidemic , we used the exponential decline rate of the second declining stage , namely - 0 . 32 ( Guangdong ) and - 0 . 26 ( Hebei ) . The estimated durations of the epidemics were 75 days and 56 days , respectively , which were consistent with the actual data . To reveal complex relations between the clearing time T c with respect to the R c 1 during the early exponen - tial growth stage ( EGS ) , the peak time τ and the rela - tively strengthened NPI S c , we derived the contour plots shown in Fig . 4 . These indicate the threshold conditions for clearing or not clearing epidemics induced by the Delta and Omicron strains with different values of S c . In particular , when S c = 0 . 6 ( or 0 . 7 , or 0 . 8 ) , it is impos - sible to clear epidemics caused by the Delta or Omicron strains once R c 1 exceeds 2 . 4 ( or 3 . 3 , or 5 . 1 ) . Fortunately , the estimated R c 1 values for all epidemics caused by the Delta and Omicron strains in China were less than these thresholds ( Supplementary materials : Extended Data Tables 1 and 2 ) , indicating that the dynamic zero - case policy was being successful . Moreover , when S c = 0 . 7 , if the R c 1 reaches 2 . 5 ( or 3 ) in the EGS , the epidemic could be cleared within one month , provided that the EGS could be cut off within 11 days ( 5 days ) . When S c = 0 . 8 , if the R c 1 reaches 3 in the EGS , the epidemic could be cleared within one month provided that the EGS could be cut off within 12 days , otherwise the epidemic cannot be cleared within two ( three ) months if the exponential growth trends cannot cut be off within 23 ( 34 ) days . In addition , compared with Hebei , the R c 1 in Shaanxi was slightly higher than that in Hebei , but the exponential growth period of Shaanxi was 8 days shorter than that in Hebei , which resulted in the clearing time in Shaanxi being nearly 1 month ear - lier than that in Hebei . This illustrates that the exponen - tial growth period played an essential role in realizing the dynamic zero - case policy . It is worth noting that the estimated exponential growth periods for Jilin ( Shang - hai ) were 18 days ( 45 days ) ( Supplementary materials : Extended Data Tables 3 and 4 ) , so the estimated clear - ing time of the epidemic in Jilin was nearly 3 months , while the epidemic in Shanghai could be cleared within 3 months , agreeing well with the real scenarios . In order to compare the epidemic situation without vaccines and control measures with existing vaccine regimes and very strong control measures , we assumed that the basic reproduction number of the Omicron vari - ant was 8 ( baseline value ) , and calculated the cumula - tive number of infected people within 9 days ( N 9 I ) and the percentage decrease in the cumulative number of infected people compared to the baseline value ( P d ) under different CRNs and the baseline value . As shown in Extended Data Table 5 , we found that the total num - ber of infected persons in the nine waves of the Omicron Fig . 4 Determination of epidemic duration and threshold level of the NPIs’ strength . Based on the strength of NPIs ( S c ) and the formula for T c without considering the plateau period ( τ 3 ) , the maximum value of R c 1 during the exponential growth stage that can be dynamically cleared in the later decline stage under different intensities of NPIs can be obtained . The contour diagram of the clearing time T c with respect to the CRN R c 1 during the early EGS , the peak time τ and the intensity of NPI measures S c . Numbers marked on lines of the figure represent values of T c , and dots represent the values of R c 1 and τ of these regions . The horizontal line R T c 1 represents the threshold value of whether the epidemic can be dynamically cleared or not , which indicates that the epidemic cannot be cleared once R c 1 exceeds R T c 1 Page 11 of 12 Tang et al . BMC Public Health ( 2023 ) 23 : 1084 epidemic in China has been reduced by more than 99 % compared with its benchmark R 0 . In addition , we also calculated the time required for the number of infected people to reach 10 , 000 . In the case of the Omicron base - line R 0 , it takes 10 days to reach 10 , 000 infections , while in the nine waves of the Omicron epidemic in China , it takes 41 days when the R c 1 value is the minimum of 2 . 14 ( Guangdong ) and 20 days when the R c 1 value is very large ( 3 . 7 , Jilin ) . Therefore , China’s comprehensive capacity in vaccine and health prevention and control could have delayed the rapid growth of the epidemic for at least 11 – 32 days , thereby winning some precious time for the comprehensive deployment and strengthening of preven - tion and control measures . Discussion Our study found that the real R c 1 values of the Omi - cron variant in the epidemic of 9 regions in China was only 2 . 14 – 3 . 70 ( Supplementary materials : Extended Data Table 2 ) , which was not only far lower than those of South Africa , the United States of America and Hong Kong ( 6 – 7 . 75 ) [ 15 , 17 , 20 ] , but also lower than the value of 3 . 82 for the original strain in Wuhan . By comparing the real data with simulated infections under the benchmark R 0 value for Omicron in the 7 regions where the Omi - cron epidemic had ended as of 1 June 2022 , we found that more than 99 % of the cases of COVID - 19 were prevented ( Supplementary materials : Extended Data Table 5 ) . Under the combined effect of vaccines and NPIs , the DZCP maintained the R c 1 of the 101 outbreaks studied in this paper below the safe threshold level , but the strength of NPIs was close to saturation ( 0 . 89 ) , and there was little room for improvement . However , the high infectivity and occult nature of mutant strains inevitably leads to diffi - culties in early detection [ 30 – 32 ] , which makes the early exponential growth exceed the threshold for successful dynamic zeroing , leading to increasing uncertainty about the outbreak of new , larger scale , aggregated outbreaks , and even to epidemics becoming out of control due to waning immunity [ 30 – 32 ] . After the “new 10 measures” announced on 7 December 2022 [ 5 , 6 ] , many large cities , including Beijing , Shanghai , Chongqing and Chengdu , have experienced shocking first waves with the num - ber of infected people approaching 70 % , which has had huge impacts on the healthcare system . The above results confirm that there exists a critical threshold for the NPI strategy of the DZCP , but when the intensity of NPIs is lower than this threshold , a major outbreak is inevitable . Therefore , further consolidating and strengthening of China’s vaccine immune barrier can effectively improve China’s ability to prevent and control epidemics and pro - vide greater scope for the selection and adjustment of NPIs . The models and analysis methods established in this study are not only applicable to the study of small - scale clustering COVID - 19 epidemics in China , but are also applicable to the study of epidemic development trends and their durations in other regions or for other diseases . However , due to the assumption that the number of sus - ceptible individuals is approximately equal to the total population , the model can only be applied to small - scale outbreak research caused by a virus with a low trans - mission rate or with strict control measures , as well as research on the development of epidemic trends during the early stages of an outbreak . Conclusions The main conclusions are that the durations of each outbreak and their dynamic zeroing processes mainly depended on their early exponential growth rates , peak times and peak values , as well as their late exponential decline rates . Moreover , the early or late discovery of each outbreak and the timing when NPIs were started are two key factors that determine the early exponential growth rate and peak value , which naturally affect the duration of each outbreak . The synergistic effect of the above factors affecting the duration of epidemics and the DZCP is an important subject for further in - depth study . Moreover , we did not take into account the impact of factors such as vaccination time and immune wan - ing on the independent effect of the vaccine , which may affect the accuracy of estimates [ 33 , 34 ] . How to inte - grate immune dynamic waning and develop more realis - tic models including age structure and symptomatic and asymptomatic classes is an important aspect for future research [ 33 , 34 ] .
