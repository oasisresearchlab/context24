M b CD treatment strongly inhibited endocytosis of transferrin and EGF , whereas endocytosis of ricin was less affected . The inhibition of transferrin endocytosis was completely reversible . On removal of M b CD it was restored by contin - ued incubation of the cells even in serum - free medium . The recovery in serum - free medium was inhibited by addition of lovastatin , which prevents cholesterol synthesis , but endocytosis recovered when a water - soluble form of cholesterol was added together with lovastatin . Electron microscopical studies of M b CD - treated HEp - 2 cells revealed that typical invaginated caveolae were no longer present . Moreover , the invagination of clathrin - coated pits was strongly inhibited , resulting in accumulation of shallow coated pits . Quantitative immunogold labeling showed that transferrin receptors were concen - trated in coated pits to the same degree ( approximately sevenfold ) after M b CD treatment as in control cells . Our results therefore indicate that although clathrin - independent ( and caveolae - independent ) endocytosis still operates after removal of cholesterol , cholesterol is essential for the formation of clathrin - coated endocytic vesicles . INTRODUCTION Endocytosis occurs by clathrin - dependent as well as clathrin - independent mechanisms ( van Deurs et al . , 1989 ; Sandvig and van Deurs , 1994 , 1996 ) . Clathrin - dependent endocytosis is the best - deﬁned process so far and is responsible for the rapid uptake of , e . g . , hormones , growth factors , and transport molecules such as EGF and transferrin . The interaction of the molecules involved in this process has been investi - gated both in vivo and in vitro , resulting in character - ization of a number of important proteins such as clathrin , adaptors , and dynamin ( Schmid , 1997 ) . Less is known about clathrin - independent endocytosis , but different forms seem to exist ; for instance , both dy - namin dependent and dynamin - independent mecha - nisms have been reported ( Damke et al . , 1994 , 1995 ; Deirdre et al . , 1998 ; Henley et al . , 1998 ) . Clathrin - inde - pendent endocytosis can clearly be different from up - take by invaginated caveolae . Thus , clathrin - indepen - dent endocytosis exists both in lymphocytes ( Subtil et al . , 1994 ) and on the apical side of polarized Madin – Darby canine kidney ( MDCK ) cells ( Eker et al . , 1994 ) , which do not contain invaginated caveolae ( Vogel et al . , 1998 ) . Earlier studies have suggested a role for cholesterol in endocytosis ( Heiniger et al . , 1976 ) ; however , the type of endocytosis affected by cholesterol depletion was not investigated . Cholesterol present in the mem - brane of mammalian cells is required for normal cel - lular function ( Bloch , 1991 ) and either is delivered from low - density lipoproteins internalized by recep - ‡ Corresponding author .

A major fraction of cholesterol is present in the plasma membrane ( Lange , 1991 ) , and cholesterol is important for various processes at the cell surface . For instance , there seems to be a direct interaction between the oxytocin recep - tor and cholesterol ( Klein et al . , 1995 ) , and also the acetylcholine receptor was found to have a functional requirement for cholesterol ( Criado et al . , 1982 ) . Fur - thermore , it has been proposed that annexin II , which is involved in the endocytic pathway ( Creutz , 1992 ; Gruenberg and Emans , 1993 ) , serves as an interface between membranes containing a high amount of cho - lesterol and the actin cytoskeleton ( Harder et al . , 1997 ) , and it is clear that cholesterol is essential for the struc - ture and function of invaginated caveolae , including the caveolae - dependent endocytosis that has been re - ported in some cell types ( Rothberg et al . , 1990 ; Parton et al . , 1994 ; Parton , 1996 ; Schnitzer and Oh , 1994 ; Smaby et al . , 1996 ; Chang et al . , 1998 ; Hailstones et al . , 1998 ) . In the present article , we have studied the role of cholesterol in clathrin - dependent and clathrin - inde - pendent endocytosis by using methyl - b - cyclodextrin ( M b CD ) 1 to remove cholesterol from the plasma mem - brane . It has been shown that both b - cyclodextrin and M b CD remove cholesterol from cultured cells ( Ohtani et al . , 1989 ; Kilsdonk et al . , 1995 ; Klein et al . , 1995 ) , and we have here used the methylated form because it was found to be more efﬁcient than b - cyclodextrin ( Klein et al . , 1995 ) . Cyclodextrins are cyclic oligomers of glucose that have the capacity to sequester lipophiles in their hydrophobic core ( Pitha et al . , 1988 ) . The water - soluble M b CD is known to form soluble inclusion complexes with cholesterol , thereby enhancing its solubility in aqueous solution ( Pitha et al . , 1988 ; Irie et al . , 1992 ) . In this article we demonstrate that cholesterol plays an important role in the invagination of clathrin - coated pits and therefore in clathrin - dependent endocytosis . MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials M b CD ( average degree of substitution : 10 . 5 – 14 . 7 methyl groups per molecule ) , b - cyclodextrin , a - cyclodextrin , g - cyclodextrin , water - sol - uble cholesterol ( with ; 40 mg of cholesterol per gram solid ; balance M b CD ) , lovastatin , pronase , HEPES , geneticin , lactose , BSA , ricin , and holo - transferrin ( iron - saturated ) were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co . ( St . Louis , MO ) . [ 3 H ] leucine was obtained from the Radiochemical Center ( Amersham , Buckinghamshire , UK ) . Na 125 I and 125 I - EGF were purchased from DuPont ( Brussels , Belgium ) . Ricin and transferrin were 125 I - labeled according to Fraker and Speck ( 1978 ) to a speciﬁc activity of 2 3 10 4 – 6 3 10 4 cpm / ng . Cells MDCK cells ( strain II ) transfected with the human transferrin re - ceptor ( TfR ) ( MDCK II hTfR ) ( from Dr . W . Hunziker , Lausanne , Switzerland ) were maintained in DMEM ( Flow Laboratories , Irvine , Scotland ) supplemented with 5 % FCS ( Life Technologies , Paisly , Scotland ) , 100 m g / ml streptomycin , 100 U / ml penicillin , 2 mM l - glutamine ( Life Technologies ) , and 0 . 25 mg / ml geneticin . HEp - 2 , A431 , and NIH / 3T3 cells ( American Tissue Type Collection , Rock - ville , MD ) were maintained in the same medium without the addi - tion of geneticin and with different amounts of serum ( 5 % FCS , 10 % FCS , and 10 % NCS , respectively ) . The HeLa cell line ( tTA - HeLa ) , stably transfected with the cDNA for dyn K44A , was cultured as described previously ( Damke et al . , 1995 ) . For experiments , cell lines were seeded into 24 - well plates ( Falcon , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) at a density of 10 5 cells / well , or in Falcon 25 cm 2 ﬂasks at a density of 1 . 25 3 10 6 1 or 2 d before the experiment . The experiments were performed in HEPES - buffered medium . Measurement of Binding and Endocytosis of 125 I - Ricin Binding of ricin was measured as the amount of cell - associated 125 I - ricin after a 30 min incubation at 0° or 37°C with 125 I - ricin ( 40 ng / ml ) and four washes with cold HEPES - buffered medium . Endo - cytosed 125 I - labeled ricin was measured after 15 min at 37°C as the amount of toxin that could not be removed after one rapid wash , a 5 - min incubation at 37°C , followed by three rapid washes , all with 0 . 1 M lactose in HEPES - buffered medium at 37°C ( Sandvig and Olsnes , 1979 ) . The endocytosed ricin was measured in a gamma counter ( 1261 Multigamma , Wallac , Gaithersburg , MD ) . Measurement of Binding and Endocytosis of 125 I - Transferrin Binding of transferrin was measured as the amount of cell - associ - ated 125 I - transferrin after a 30 min incubation at 0° or 37°C with 125 I - transferrin ( 100 ng / ml ) and four washes with cold HEPES - buffered medium . Endocytosed 125 I - labeled transferrin was mea - sured after 5 min at 37°C and calculated as the percentage of total cell - associated ( endocytosed and surface - bound ) transferrin ( Ciechanover et al . , 1983 ) . Surface - bound transferrin was removed by 1 - h incubation with HEPES medium containing 2 mg / ml pro - nase on ice . After pronase treatment the medium containing the cells was centrifuged for 2 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge ( Madi - son , WI ) before the radioactive contents in the cell pellet ( endocy - tosed ) and in the supernatant ( surface bound ) were measured with a gamma counter . Measurement of Binding and Endocytosis of 125 I - EGF Binding of EGF was measured as the amount of cell - associated 125 I - EGF after a 30 min incubation at 0° or 37°C with 125 I - EGF ( 3 – 4 m Ci / ml ) and four washes with cold HEPES . Endocytosed 125 I - la - beled EGF was measured after 10 min at 37°C and calculated as the percentage of total cell - associated EGF . Surface - bound EGF was measured as the amount of EGF that could be released by low pH after three rapid washes with PBS at 0°C . The cells were then incubated at 0°C for 6 min with low pH buffer ( 0 . 5 M NaCl and 0 . 2 M CH 3 COOH in HEPES , pH 2 . 5 ) , followed by one rapid wash with the same buffer . Endocytosed EGF was measured as the amount of EGF that could not be removed by this treatment ( Sandvig et al . , 1987 ) . Measurement of the Potassium Content in Cells The potassium content in cells was measured after the cells were washed three times with 100 mM MgCl 2 , air - dried , and dissolved in 1 Abbreviations used : M b CD , methyl - b - cyclodextrin ; TfR , trans - ferrin receptor .

Potassium was then determined by ion selective electrodes ( Vitros 250 ; Johnson - Johnson Clinica Diagnostics , Rochester , NY ) . Measurement of Protein Synthesis Protein synthesis was measured by incubating the cells for 10 min in a HEPES - buffered medium with 1 m Ci / ml [ 3 H ] leucine . The medium was then removed , and 5 % trichloroacetic acid was added . This solution was removed 10 min later , and the cells were washed twice with the same solution to remove free radioactive leucine . The precipitated protein was then dissolved in 0 . 1 M KOH , and the radioactivity associated with the cells was measured in a b - counter ( MINAXI , TRI - CARB 4000 SERIES , United Technologies , Packard , Meriden , CT ) . Electron Microscopy HEp - 2 cells for EM were preincubated with and without M b CD ( 10 or 15 mM ) for 15 or 30 min at 37°C , washed with HEPES - buffered medium , and ﬁxed with 2 % formaldehyde and 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M sodium phosphate buffer , pH 7 . 2 . The cells were then washed , scraped off the ﬂasks , pelleted , and post - ﬁxed with OsO 4 , contrasted en bloc with 1 % uranyl acetate , dehydrated in a graded series of ethanols , and embedded in Epon . Sections were further contrasted with lead citrate and uranyl acetate and examined in a Philips CM 100 electron microscope ( Philips , Eindhoven , the Neth - erlands ) . In some experiments , control cells and cells treated with M b CD were ﬁxed , washed with PBS , and incubated with anti - human TfR antibody B3 / 25 ( Boehringer Mannheim , Mannheim , Germany ) , 2 m g / ml PBS , for 1 h at room temperature . Then the cells remaining in monolayer in the culture ﬂasks were washed with PBS and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with goat anti - mouse IgG coupled to 10 nm gold ( Amersham ) , washed , scraped off , and processed for EM . Quantiﬁcation of the immunogold labeling for TfRs was performed as described by Hansen et al . ( 1992 ) . Effect of M b CD on Cellular Cholesterol and Invaginated Caveolae HEp - 2 cells were preincubated in HEPES - buffered DMEM with 0 . 2 % BSA for 10 min and then incubated for 15 min at 37°C in HEPES - buffered DMEM with 1 m Ci ( 1 a , 1 b ( n ) - [ 3 H ] ) - cholesterol ( tol - uene solution ; Amersham ) to label the cell surface ( Lange , 1991 ; Debry et al . , 1997 ) . To equilibrate with the cholesterol of intracellular compartments , cells were incubated for 20 h in DMEM containing 2 . 5 % delipidated calf serum ( Sigma C - 1696 ) and 1 m Ci [ 3 H ] choles - terol ( Debry et al . , 1997 ; Keller and Simons , 1998 ) . In both instances , cells were subsequently washed thoroughly and incubated at 37°C with agitation in 1 ml DMEM without M b CD , or with 10 mM M b CD for 15 , 30 , and 60 min . After washing , the cells were lysed in 250 m l 2 % NP - 40 , 0 . 2 % SDS in distilled water , and the lysates were then centrifuged to remove insoluble material before aliquots were mixed with EcoLite 1 scintillation mixture , 1 : 10 , and counted in a scintillation counter ( Beckman , Fullerton , CA ) . In parallel experiments ( i . e . , same cell passage , same day , and same M b CD solution ) , HEp - 2 cells were washed and incubated with 10 mM M b CD in DMEM for 0 , 15 , 30 , and 60 min at 37°C , washed again , ﬁxed , and further processed for electron microscopy as described above . The amount of characteristically invaginated caveolae on the plasma membrane ( Vogel et al . , 1998 ) was subse - quently quantitated . RESULTS Effect of M b CD on Endocytosis of Transferrin , EGF , and Ricin To study whether incubation with M b CD would affect endocytosis of transferrin and EGF , cells were prein - cubated for 15 min with M b CD at 37°C , and then 125 I - transferrin or 125 I - EGF was added . Endocytosis of transferrin was strongly reduced with increasing con - centrations of M b CD ( 50 % reduction at 10 mM M b CD ) ( Figure 1 ) . As shown in Figure 2 , 10 mM Figure 1 .

MDCK II cells were washed brieﬂy in HEPES - buffered me - dium before incubation with and without the indicated concentra - tions of M b CD for 15 min at 37°C . 125 I - labeled transferrin or 125 I - labeled ricin was then added to the cells , and the amounts of endocytosed transferrin or ricin were measured as described in MATERIALS AND METHODS . The error bars show deviations between duplicates . Figure 2 . Effect of M b CD on endocytosis of EGF . HEp - 2 cells were washed brieﬂy in HEPES - buffered medium and incubated with and without M b CD ( 10 mM ) for 15 min at 37°C . 125 I - labeled EGF was then added to the cells , and the amounts of endocytosed EGF were measured as described in MATERIALS AND METHODS . The error bars show deviations between duplicates . Role of Cholesterol in Endocytosis Vol . 10 , April 1999 963 M b CD also gives a strong reduction of 125 I - EGF endo - cytosis ( ; 40 % ) . In agreement with the result that M b CD inhibits transferrin endocytosis , pretreatment of cells with 10 mM M b CD for 15 min at 37°C in - creased the cell surface binding of 125 I - transferrin two - fold ( Figure 3 ) . To further investigate the effect of M b CD on clathrin - dependent endocytosis , uptake of 125 I - transferrin was measured in different cell lines preincubated with 10 mM M b CD for 15 min at 37°C . As shown in Figure 4 , this concentration of M b CD inhibited endocytosis of transferrin in all cell lines by ; 50 % . To test whether M b CD would affect all endocytic activity , we studied the uptake of a molecule that does not only enter by clathrin - dependent endocytosis . Ex - periments performed with increasing concentrations of M b CD showed that the endocytosis of the general membrane marker ricin ( Sandvig and Olsnes , 1979 ; Sandvig and van Deurs , 1996 ) was less affected by increasing concentrations of M b CD than that of trans - ferrin in MDCK II cells ( Figure 1 ) . In addition , there was no effect on the binding of 125 I - ricin ( Figure 3 ) . Endocytosis of 125 I - ricin was also measured in differ - ent cell lines preincubated with 10 mM M b CD for 15 min at 37°C . As shown in Figure 4 , M b CD inhibited endocytosis of ricin in the various cell types by ; 20 % . Because M b CD strongly decreased the number of in - vaginated caveolae ( see below ) , the data suggest that there is another clathrin - independent form of endocy - tosis that is resistant to removal of cholesterol . The data described above suggest that removal of cholesterol has a much stronger effect on clathrin - dependent than on clathrin - independent endocytosis . To further investigate this question we studied the effect of M b CD on transferrin and ricin endocytosis in HeLa K44A cells . These cells express mutant dynamin on removal of tetracycline , and clathrin - dependent endocytosis will then become inhibited ( Damke et al . , 1994 ) . HeLa K44A cells grown with and without tet - racycline were incubated with and without M b CD for 15 min at 37°C , and then 125 I - transferrin or 125 I - ricin was added . As shown in Figure 5A , ricin endocytosis was essentially unaffected by M b CD in the absence of tetracycline ( mutant dynamin is expressed ) ; however , M b CD decreased the endocytosis of ricin by ; 20 % in the presence of tetracycline ( both clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent endocytosis are function - ing ) ( Figure 5A ) . As shown in Figure 5B , endocytosis of transferrin is inhibited by M b CD to more than half in the presence of tetracycline , whereas transferrin endocytosis is blocked ( . 80 % ) , as expected , when mu - tant dynamin is expressed and inhibits the clathrin - dependent pathway . The Effect of M b CD on Endocytosis Is Related to Removal of Cholesterol In agreement with previous studies ( Neufeld et al . , 1996 ; Keller and Simons , 1998 ) we found that M b CD efﬁciently extracts cholesterol from HEp - 2 cells ( Figure 6A ) . Caveolae with the characteristic deeply invagi - nated shape were frequently observed in control HEp - 2 cells . As an alternative approach to evaluating the effect of M b CD on plasma membrane cholesterol , we used the observation that typically invaginated caveolae ( Figure 6B ) can only be maintained in the presence of cholesterol ( Rothberg et al . , 1990 ; Chang et al . , 1998 ; Hailstones et al . , 1998 ) . Figure 6C shows that M b CD extraction of cholesterol has a pronounced ef - fect on the number of invaginated caveolae . Although previous studies have shown that M b CD speciﬁcally removes cholesterol from the plasma membrane ( Ohtani et al . , 1989 ; Kilsdonk et al . , 1995 ; Klein et al . , 1995 ; Neufeld et al . , 1996 ; Keller and Si - mons , 1998 ) , we investigated whether the decreased transferrin endocytosis in the presence of M b CD was due to loss of cholesterol from the plasma membrane . Two other cyclodextrins , a - cyclodextrin and g - cyclo - dextrin , do not bind cholesterol in the same way as M b CD ( Ohtani et al . , 1989 ) , and we therefore tested whether they would affect transferrin endocytosis . In contrast , b - cyclodextrin , like M b CD , will extract cho - lesterol from the plasma membrane ( Ohtani et al . , 1989 ; Klein et al . , 1995 ) . HEp - 2 cells were preincubated with 10 mM a - , b - , methyl - b - , or g - cyclodextrins for 15 min at 37°C , before the addition of 125 I - transferrin . Five minutes later , the amount of endocytosed trans - Figure 3 . Effect of M b CD on binding of transferrin ( F ) and ricin ( E ) . MDCK II cells were incubated with and without the indicated concentrations of M b CD in HEPES - buffered medium at 37°C for 15 min . Then the cells were cooled down to 0°C , 125 I - labeled transferrin or 125 I - labeled ricin was added , and binding was measured after 30 min at 0°C as described in MATERIALS AND METHODS . The error bars show deviations between duplicates . S . K . Rodal et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 964 ferrin was measured . As shown in Figure 7 , both M b CD and b - cyclodextrin inhibited endocytosis of transferrin ( . 50 % ) , whereas neither a - nor g - cyclo - dextrin had any signiﬁcant effect . Furthermore , when transferrin endocytosis was measured after preincu - bation of the cells with a M b CD - complex that was already saturated with cholesterol before it was added to the cells , there was no reduction in the endocytosis of transferrin ( our unpublished results ) . To further investigate the dependence of endocyto - sis on cholesterol , we studied whether the inhibition of transferrin endocytosis by M b CD was reversible . First we tried to compensate for the loss of plasma membrane cholesterol by adding cholesterol to the cells . The cells were preincubated with M b CD for 15 min at 37°C , and then HEPES - buffered medium with or without 5 % fetal calf serum or 400 m g / ml water - soluble cholesterol was added before endocytosis of 125 I - transferrin was measured . As shown in Figure 8A , there was a time - dependent recovery of the transferrin endocytosis . The uptake of transferrin was still inhib - ited by ; 20 % after a 1 - h incubation even when serum or cholesterol was added ; however , after 3 - h incuba - tion , the inhibition by M b CD was totally reversed . The ﬁnding that transferrin endocytosis recovered even in the absence of added serum or cholesterol suggested that the recovery could be due to cholesterol synthesis in the cells . This hypothesis was strengthened by the ﬁnding that lovastatin , an inhibitor of cholesterol syn - thesis , did inhibit the recovery of transferrin endocy - tosis unless the water soluble form of cholesterol was added ( Figure 8B ) . Unless the cells were pretreated with M b CD , lovastatin only decreased transferrin en - docytosis by ; 10 % , suggesting that there is only a small decrease in the level of plasma membrane cho - lesterol during 3 h in the absence of cholesterol syn - thesis . Thus , our results clearly indicate that the effect of M b CD observed is due to extraction of cholesterol . It was recently reported that removal of cholesterol with M b CD did not induce release of lactate dehydro - genase , suggesting that there are no large changes in the permeability of the plasma membrane ( Keller and Simons , 1998 ) . This is in agreement with our ﬁnding that up to 10 mM M b CD did not reduce protein syn - thesis in our cells to any signiﬁcant extent ( Figure 9A ) . Also , as shown in Figure 9B , 10 mM M b CD did not Figure 4 . Effect of M b CD on transferrin and ricin endocyto - sis in different cell lines . HEp - 2 , NIH / 3T3 , MDCK II , and A431 cells were washed brieﬂy in HEPES - buffered medium and incubated with and without M b CD ( 10 mM ) for 15 min at 37°C . 125 I - labeled transferrin or 125 I - labeled ricin was then added to the cells , and the amounts of endocytosed trans - ferrin or ricin were measured as described in MATERIALS AND METHODS . The error bars show deviations between dupli - cates . Role of Cholesterol in Endocytosis Vol . 10 , April 1999 965 cause any signiﬁcant membrane leakage of potassium . Furthermore , in MDCK II cells there was no increase in the cell - associated amount of 45 Ca 2 1 even when the isotope was added to cells in a Ca 2 1 - free buffer ( our unpublished results ) . In HEp - 2 cells there was a small increase ( 20 % ) under the same conditions , but there was no signiﬁcant change when the isotope was added to a buffer containing normal amounts of CaCl 2 ( 2 mM ) ( our unpublished results ) . Thus , in agreement with the data published by Keller and Simons ( 1998 ) , Figure 5 .

Molecular Biology of the Cell 966 our data indicate that M b CD strongly decreases clath - rin - dependent endocytosis without causing any large permeability changes . Effect of M b CD on Clathrin - coated Pits and TfR Distribution The inhibition of endocytosis of transferrin ( and EGF ) by M b CD could reﬂect that removal of cholesterol prevented clathrin - coated pit formation , i . e . , assembly of clathrin coats on the cytoplasmic face of the mem - brane ; however , clathrin - coated pits were readily ob - served by electron microscopy in M b CD - treated cells , although they clearly appeared more ﬂattened than in control cells . To investigate how M b CD affected the morphological appearance of clathrin - coated pits quantitatively , we classiﬁed the pits as follows : shal - low pits , which are ﬂattened or only slightly invagi - nated ( Figure 10 , A and B ) ; invaginated pits , that is , when the pits are clearly invaginated but the necks connecting them with the exterior are still open wide ( slightly wider or narrower than the diameter of the pit itself ) ( Figure 10C ) ; and pits that are almost or completely pinched off , where the neck is very narrow ( Figure 10D ) , or absent in the particular plane of sec - tioning ( which could very well mean that the pit is surface - connected in another plane of sectioning ; see Petersen and van Deurs [ 1983 ] ) ( Figure 10E ) . These three categories of clathrin - coated pits are shown schematically in Figure 10F and will be referred to below as type 1 , 2 , or 3 . When control HEp - 2 cells and cells treated with 10 mM M b CD for 15 min at 37°C were compared with respect to the relative frequency of the three types of clathrin - coated pits ( Figure 10G ) , the effect of M b CD was striking : type 2 and in partic - ular type 3 dominated in control cells , whereas M b CD caused a clear predominance of type 1 pits . Having shown that M b CD does not affect endocy - tosis in general or does prevent assembly of clathrin - coated pits at the cell surface but interferes with the ability of ﬂattened pits to invaginate , it was important to determine whether TfRs could still accumulate in the pits of M b CD - treated cells . We therefore used an immunogold - labeling protocol to detect TfRs on the surface of HEp - 2 cells ( Hansen et al . , 1992 ) . As shown in Figure 11A , TfR gold labeling was distinct in the shallow , clathrin - coated pits mostly found in the M b CD - treated cells . Indeed , gold labeling was also seen on the cell surface outside clathrin - coated pits and on microvilli ( Figure 11 , B and C ) . In control HEp - 2 cells , 8 . 7 % of the TfRs as detected by immuno - gold labeling ( using 2 m g / ml of the B3 / 25 anti - TfR antibody on preﬁxed cells ) are localized to coated pits that occupy 1 . 1 – 1 . 4 % of the total surface area of these cells ( Hansen et al . , 1992 ) . Accordingly , TfRs are con - centrated approximately sevenfold in the coated pits ( Table 1 ) . After incubation with 10 mM M b CD , we found that 11 . 5 % of the TfR gold labeling was local - ized to coated pits ( Table 1 ) ; however , because the surface area now occupied by coated pits had in - creased by 25 % ( presumably reﬂecting the fact that efﬁcient invagination and pinching off are perturbed ) , the amount of golds in coated pits still corresponds to a sevenfold TfR concentration ( Table 1 ) . It should also be noted that we found a 60 % increase in the total TfR cell - surface labeling in M b CD - treated cells as com - pared with control cells ( Table 1 ) , in agreement with the biochemical data reported above . Thus M b CD treatment does not interfere with the ability of TfRs to become concentrated efﬁciently in coated pits . Taken together , our ﬁndings therefore indicate that rather than blocking all types of endocytosis or preventing TfRs from entering clathrin - coated pits , M b CD per - turbs invagination of the coated pits . DISCUSSION In the present study we have investigated the role of cholesterol in endocytosis by using M b CD , which spe - ciﬁcally removes cholesterol from the plasma mem - brane ( Ohtani et al . , 1989 ; Kilsdonk et al . , 1995 ; Klein et al . , 1995 ; Neufeld et al . , 1996 ) . Our results show that endocytosis of transferrin and EGF was strongly re - duced by addition of M b CD . This reduction could be due 1 ) to a general inhibition of all endocytic activity , 2 ) to a perturbation of the ability of clathrin - coated Figure 7 .

The ﬁrst possibil - ity can be excluded because the general membrane marker ricin is still internalized . Furthermore , M b CD clearly reduced ricin endocytosis to a much larger extent when both clathrin - dependent and clathrin - in - dependent endocytosis were operating than when Figure 8 . Reversal of M b CD - induced inhibition of transferrin endocytosis in the absence ( A ) or presence ( B ) of lovastatin . In both cases MDCK II cells were washed brieﬂy in HEPES - buffered medium and incubated with and without M b CD ( 10 mM ) for 15 min at 37°C . The cells were then incubated in HEPES - buffered medium with and without 5 % FCS or water - soluble cholesterol ( 400 m g / ml ) in the presence or absence of lovastatin ( 5 m g / ml ) from 15 min to 3 h ( A ) or for 3 h ( B ) before 125 I - labeled transferrin was added . The amounts of endocytosed transferrin were measured as described in MATERIALS AND METHODS . The error bars show deviations between duplicates . S . K . Rodal et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 968 only clathrin - independent endocytosis was function - ing . The results indicate that M b CD strongly reduces clathrin - dependent endocytosis , whereas there is a clathrin - independent endocytic pathway that is less affected . Because invagination of caveolae also is af - fected by M b CD , this clathrin - independent endocyto - sis seems to be caveolae - independent . It has previ - ously been found that a downregulation of clathrin - dependent endocytosis can be associated with an upregulation of clathrin - independent endocytosis ( Damke et al . , 1995 ) , and there is a possibility that this might occur also on treatment with M b CD . Second , EM revealed that coated pits were indeed formed in M b CD - treated cells , but a marked ﬂattening of these structures had taken place . Third , the quantitative im - munogold data clearly show that the TfRs are not prevented from being concentrated in ( the shallow ) coated pits after M b CD treatment . A concentration of TfRs in clathrin - coated pits of approximately seven - fold both in M b CD - treated cells and in control cells is in agreement with previous data ( Hansen et al . , 1992 ) . TfRs undergo endocytosis and recycling , and the number of TfRs on the surface is consequently depen - dent on both the amount of receptors which is inter - nalized , and the amount that is recycled . The ﬁnding that binding of transferrin to the cell surface was increased nearly twofold by M b CD indicates that M b CD inhibits endocytosis without reducing the re - cycling of the TfRs to the same extent . There seems to be a somewhat stronger effect of M b CD on the mor - phology of the clathrin - coated pits than on the uptake of transferrin . This might be due to the formation of some invaginated coated pits that rapidly pinch off . Our results strongly suggest that removal of choles - terol perturbs clathrin - coated pit invagination and , therefore , coated vesicle formation . It has previously been reported that the membrane in coated pits is not disrupted by the sterol - binding drugs ﬁlipin or digitonin , although the membrane adjacent to these specialized domains readily binds these agents ( Montesano et al . , 1979 ) . On the other hand , endosomal membrane becomes susceptible to ﬁlipin disruption as soon as the clathrin coat is re - leased ( McGookey et al . , 1983 ) , suggesting that the clathrin coat directly or indirectly binds cholesterol and prevents access to ﬁlipin . In agreement with those results , nystatin was reported not to affect transferrin endocytosis ( Deckert et al . , 1996 ) , and our own unpub - lished data showed that ﬁlipin has no effect on trans - ferrin endocytosis in HEp - 2 cells . Also , it is not clear that complexes between cholesterol and sterol - binding drugs would affect endocytosis in the same way as removal of cholesterol by M b CD . Sterol - binding drugs such as ﬁlipin , nystatin , and digitonin have been found to inhibit endocytosis from invaginated caveolae and caveolae - like domains ( Schnitzer et al . , 1994 ; Deckert et al . , 1996 ; Orlandi and Fishman , 1998 ) . Invaginated caveolae disappear in cells that are depleted of cholesterol or exposed to sterol - binding agents ( Rothberg et al . , 1990 , 1992 ; Schnitzer et al . , 1994 ) . In agreement with those data , our results clearly show that M b CD leads to disap - Figure 9 . Effect of M b CD on protein synthesis ( A ) and on the intracellular potassium content ( B ) .

That M b CD treatment leads to loss of invaginated caveolae is in agreement with the recent results of Hailstones et al .

The relative frequency of the different types of coated pits is shown . Bar , 100 nm . S . K . Rodal et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 970 nated caveolae . Interestingly , they found that invagi - nated caveolae only form when the cholesterol level is . 50 % of control values . Also , Orlandi and Fishman ( 1998 ) found that the activity of cholera toxin was completely inhibited by b - cyclodextrin , and they con - cluded that productive entry of cholera toxin occurs from caveolae . Furthermore , they reported that diph - theria toxin retained 80 % of its toxic activity in the presence of b - cyclodextrin , and they therefore as - sumed that entry from clathrin - coated pits was essen - tially normal . This apparently contradicts our results ; however , no direct measurement on uptake from clathrin - coated pits after b - cyclodextrin treatment was performed by Orlandi and Fishman ( 1998 ) , and the apparent discrepancy can be explained if removal of cholesterol both reduces uptake from coated pits and at the same time facilitates membrane translocation of the toxin . In fact , ﬁlipin , which does not affect uptake from clathrin - coated pits , increased the toxicity of diphtheria toxin ( Orlandi and Fishman , 1998 ) . Heiniger et al . ( 1976 ) reported that L cells , in which hydroxymethylglutaryl - CoA reductase activity and cholesterol synthesis were inhibited by addition of 25 - hydroxycholesterol , had a reduced rate of endocy - tosis of the ﬂuid - phase marker HRP . The uptake of HRP was restored by the addition of cholesterol ( Hei - niger et al . , 1976 ) . HRP is endocytosed , however , by both clathrin - dependent and clathrin - independent en - docytosis ( Oliver , 1982 ) , and the fact that cholesterol depletions of L cells seem to have a stronger effect on total endocytosis in these cells ( 50 % ) than the effect we observed on HRP endocytosis in the cell types we have tested could be due to a larger proportion of uptake by clathrin - dependent endocytosis in L cells . Interestingly , Chang et al . ( 1992 ) reported that removal of cholesterol drastically increased the number of low - Figure 11 . Effect of M b CD on clathrin - coated pits and TfR distribution .

The au - thors reported a slightly reduced internalization in - dex , but because the calculation of such an index only takes into account the amount of surface - bound ligand versus internalized ligand , in this case at the end of a long incubation , the data might actually be in agree - ment with a reduced rate of endocytosis of the recep - tor from clathrin - coated pits . Two other cyclodextrins ( Ohtani et al . , 1989 ) — a - cyclodextrin , which has been reported to remove phospholipids from the plasma membrane , and g - cyclodextrin , which is also not spe - ciﬁc for cholesterol—had much less effect on trans - ferrin endocytosis than M b CD . This supports the no - tion that it is the removal of cholesterol per se that is essential for the inhibitory effect on clathrin - depen - dent endocytosis in the M b CD - treated cells . On re - moval of M b CD , the transferrin endocytosis was fully restored by continued incubation of the cells , even in serum - free medium . The recovery was inhibited by addition of lovastatin , suggesting that the cholesterol level in the plasma membrane was restored by newly synthesized cholesterol . This idea is supported by the ﬁnding that endocytosis did recover when a water - soluble form of cholesterol was added together with lovastatin . When lovastatin is used to inhibit choles - terol synthesis , fatty acid modiﬁcation of intracellular proteins also is inhibited ( Alberts et al . , 1980 ; Brown and Goldstein , 1980 ) , and it is therefore essential for the conclusion , that cholesterol is required for clath - rin - dependent endocytosis , that addition of choles - terol can counteract the effect of treatment with lova - statin . It was reported recently that extraction of choles - terol with M b CD did not affect the amounts of lactate dehydrogenase in baby hamster kidney cells ( Keller and Simons , 1998 ) . In agreement with those ﬁndings , our results show that treatment with 10 mM M b CD had no effect on the intracellular potassium content nor on the protein synthesis , indicating that the plasma membrane permeability was not strongly af - fected . Furthermore , the lack of change in transepithe - lial resistance in M b CD - treated MDCK I cells ( our unpublished results ) and MDCK II cells ( Keller and Simons , 1998 ) , together with our ﬁnding that binding of ricin and Shiga - toxin to the cell surface was unaf - fected by M b CD ( our unpublished results ) , indicates that there are no large changes in the bilayer structure in cells treated with M b CD compared with the control cells . All of these data indicate that the ﬂattening of the clathrin - coated pits is directly correlated to the re - moval of cholesterol . It has been suggested that annexin II , which seems to be involved in both the regulated exocytic pathway ( Creutz , 1992 ) and the endocytic pathway ( Gruenberg and Emans , 1993 ) , interacts directly with cholesterol - rich domains of the bilayer , and perhaps with choles - terol itself ( Harder et al . , 1997 ) . Such a direct protein – cholesterol interaction was recently revealed for the membrane protein VIP21 - caveolin ( Murata et al . , 1995 ) . The cholesterol - binding drug ﬁlipin induces dissociation of annexin II and actin - binding proteins from endosomes ( Harder et al . , 1997 ) . In contrast , there is no evidence that cholesterol is important for binding of clathrin . As shown here , the clathrin coat stays at the plasma membrane after treatment of cells with M b CD . It is only the curvature that is affected . Actin was recently reported to be involved in clathrin - de - pendent endocytosis , because endocytosis was inhib - ited by perturbation of the actin cytoskeleton ( Parton et al . , 1994 ; Schnitzer and Oh , 1994 ; Deckert et al . , 1996 ) . Nevertheless , actin does not seem to be required for the formation of the coated - pit invagination ( Lamaze et al . , 1997 ) . Thus , the effect of M b CD de - scribed here is probably not due to an effect on the actin cytoskeleton ; however , cholesterol could be im - portant for the function of a protein involved in in - ducing curvature of clathrin - coated pits , such as af - fecting the activity of GTP - binding proteins that regulate coated - pit function ( Schmid , 1997 ) . Also , re - moval of cholesterol from the membrane might affect association of other molecules with the clathrin - coated pits , it might affect the interaction of membrane - asso - ciated proteins with each other , or it might somehow directly affect the ability of the other lipids in the clathrin - coated membrane domains to form an invag - inated structure .

Molecular Biology of the Cell 972 TION , cholesterol is important for the structure and function of membrane proteins ( Muller and Shinitzky , 1979 ; Criado et al . , 1982 ; Bloch , 1991 ; Kilsdonk et al . , 1995 ) , and furthermore , a change in the cholesterol content will affect the membrane viscosity , the expo - sure of membrane proteins to the surroundings , and therefore also the interaction between membrane pro - teins and cytosolic proteins ( Shinitzky and Inbar , 1974 ; Shinitzky and Rivnay , 1977 ) . Such changes might be responsible for the inhibition of formation of clathrin - coated pits observed here . In conclusion , our results clearly indicate that the concentration of cholesterol in the plasma membrane of mammalian cells is essential for clathrin - dependent endocytosis , and it will be important for the under - standing of this pathway to investigate why this is the case .
