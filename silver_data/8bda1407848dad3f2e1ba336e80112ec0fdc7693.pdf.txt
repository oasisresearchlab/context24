( 2020 ) ) . For instance , as of February 10th 2021 , persons aged 65 or more accounted for 81 % of the overall number of deaths from Covid - 19 in the United States ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( 2021c ) ) . Contagion and mortality , however , are di ﬀ used unevenly across and within countries . This geographical variability may hinge on several fac - tors like the healthcare system and policies , the age structure of the popu - lation and its density , culture , institutions and the like . A key institutional element that might di ﬀ er signiﬁcantly across and within countries is the family structure , whose impact on socio - economics outcomes has recently been the object of a copious literature in economics ( Baudin et al . ( 2021 ) , Browning et al . ( 2014 ) , Doepke and Tertilt ( 2016 ) , Greenwood et al . ( 2017 ) , among others ) . In this article , we argue that one aspect of the family struc - ture , namely intergenerational coresidence – deﬁned as families in which at least one elderly lives with at least one adult son / daughter – is relevant for the di ﬀ usion of , and the mortality from Covid - 19 . The rationale behind our claim lies in the hypothesis that when coresid - ing with their adult children , the elderly are more exposed to unprotected social contacts . This happens for two reasons . First , it is reasonable to assume that young adults in the working force typically have more social contacts outside the family than the elderly ( Harris ( 2020 ) , Malmgren et al . ( 2020 ) ) . This implies that coresiding elderly might have more indirect social contacts - i . e . social contacts through their family members - than non - coresiding ones . Second , since preventive measures like masks and social distance are typically not implemented in the household ( Lei et al . ( 2020 ) and Li et al . ( 2020 ) ) , those indirect social contacts will be unpro - tected . 1 All this suggests that intergenerational coresidence might foster contagion for the elderly . Since the fatality rate of Covid - 19 is dispropor - tionately huge for the elderly , we expect intergenerational coresidence to be associated with higher mortality , in particular for the elderly . 2 Using the available Census sample of 426 U . S . counties that represent 1 Intergenerational coresidence represents only one of the possible interactions between the elderly and their adult children . As underlined in the main text , a feature of inter - generational coresidence is that living in the same household makes the consistent use of preventive measures unrealistic . Another feature is that it is reasonably stable with respect to the evolution of the pandemic , while other forms of interactions ( e . g . picking up grandchildren at school ) may change as the pandemic unfolds . 2 Notice that our reasoning abstracts from another type of intergenerational cores - idence , that between parents and small or school - age children . The transmission of Covid - 19 from children to adults is still an unsettled issue ( see Forbes et al . ( 2021 ) , Wood et al . ( 2021 ) ) . 2 Jo u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof 65 % of the total American population in 2019 , we show that intergenera - tional coresidence positively correlates with mortality for the elderly from Covid - 19 in 2020 . Quantitatively , a one percentage point increase in inter - generational coresidence is associated with more than 25 additional deaths from Covid - 19 per 100 , 000 old persons , or , in absolute terms , 14 , 109 old individuals . This association is robust to controlling for several confounders , such as population density , wealth and human capital , the number of hospital beds and residents in nursing homes , the unemployment rate , the percent - age of votes for Trump in 2016 , the percentage of Hispanics and Blacks , and geographical dummies . The association persists when tested on cu - mulative quarterly data . Furthermore , we tested that our results hold good for alternative deﬁnitions of intergenerational coresidence and alternative measurements of mortality from Covid - 19 . In order to assess if the positive correlation with intergenerational cores - idence is speciﬁc to mortality from the Covid - 19 pandemic , we perform several other exercises . To start with , we show that intergenerational coresidence does not have a positive , sizeable and signiﬁcant impact on the overall mortality rate in previous , non - pandemic years . We do so in two settings . First , in a cross - section analysis for 2019 , that is more directly comparable to our benchmark . Second , in a balanced - panel of yearly data for 329 U . S . counties from 2005 to 2019 that represents 56 % of the American population in 2019 . 3 Next , we turn to cause - speciﬁc mortality rates , using both the 2019 cross - section and the same panel of counties for the period 2005 - 2019 . We show that there is no sizeable and signiﬁcant positive association between intergenerational coresidence and mortality from cardiovascular diseases and cancer , largely the most important causes of mortality in the United States . 4 This points to the singularity of the Covid - 19 positive mortality - intergenerational coresidence association . Interestingly , we ﬁnd instead some evidence of a positive relationship between intergenerational cores - idence and mortality rates due to pneumonia and inﬂuenza , two diseases that are similar to Covid - 19 in terms of transmission and epidemiology . 5 3 In Appendix B we also extend the analysis , with similar results , to a balanced - panel of decennial data for 240 U . S . counties for the period 1980 - 2010 that represents 48 % of the American population in 2010 . 4 See Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( 2021b ) . 5 As additional exercise , in Appendix B , we investigate the relationship between inter - generational coresidence and mortality in the case of the 1918 Spanish inﬂuenza . This was an episode of pandemic due to a virus that transmitted via aerosols and salivary droplets like Covid - 19 , but which , contrary to Covid - 19 , was particularly deadly for prime - age 3 Jo u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof Our paper is closely related to the brand new literature on Covid - 19 and intergenerational coresidence . The socio - economic determinants of in - tergenerational coresidence have been discussed by Costa ( 1997 ) , Ruggles ( 2007 ) and , more recently , Kaplan ( 2012 ) , Pensieroso and Sommacal ( 2014 , 2019 ) , Salcedo et al . ( 2012 ) , among others . Bayer and Kuhn ( 2020 ) were the ﬁrst to explore the possibility that intergenerational coresidence could be positively related to deaths from Covid - 19 . They use a sample of 24 coun - tries ( Australia plus some European and Asian countries ) and show that intergenerational coresidence helps to explain cross - country di ﬀ erences in the case fatality rate of Covid - 19 . Aparicio Fenoll and Grossbard ( 2020 ) expand on their study by using a larger sample represented by 79 geo - graphical units ( E . U . countries and U . S . states ) . They show that there is a positive association between the fraction of young adults living with their parents and the cumulative number of deaths from Covid - 19 . In their anal - ysis , this association is arguably stronger and more signiﬁcant when the E . U . countries are excluded from the sample and the analysis is restricted to the U . S . states only . That intergenerational coresidence does not seem to be an important determinant of case fatality rates in the European Union is maintained also by Arpino et al . ( 2020 ) . 6 On the contrary , in a mostly descriptive study , Mogi and Spijker ( 2021 ) analyse cross - country variation in the E . U . cumulative deaths between March and April 2020 and ﬁnd that it is positively associated with social and / or cultural ties , including inter - generational coresidence , the average household size and the proportion of people having frequent social contacts . Cross - country comparisons su ﬀ er from several known problems , going from how mortality and contagion are measured , to idiosyncratic di ﬀ er - ences like policy , culture , institutions and the like , to the trivial but sig - niﬁcant complication represented by the reduced size of the sample . A ﬁrst contribution of our paper is to overcome these problems by focus - ing on a more disaggregated geographical unit , the county , belonging to persons , not the elderly ( Beach et al . ( 2020 ) , Garrett ( 2008 ) , Taubenberger and Morens ( 2006 ) ) . Accordingly , we surmise that in this case intergenerational coresidence is of lesser relevance to the morbidity of the virus , and hence its mortality , since most social contacts of prime - age adults typically happen outside the family circle . Using a sample of 422 U . S . cities that represent two - thirds of American urban population in 1910 from Clay et al . ( 2019 ) , we ﬁnd no evidence of a sizeable and signiﬁcant positive association between intergenerational coresidence and either the excess mortality due to the Spanish inﬂuenza in 1918 . 6 Dowd et al . ( 2020 ) notice that Arpino et al . ( 2020 ) investigate the link between cores - idence and mortality from Covid - 19 using case fatality rates : the latter , however , is a measure of the lethality of the infection and may therefore not capture appropriately mortality . The same argument applies to Bayer and Kuhn ( 2020 ) . 4 Jo u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof a single country , the United States . This way we reduce the heterogene - ity of confounding factors that may pollute cross - country analysis , and avoid the small sample bias that makes results from a cross - state analysis in the United States less compelling . 7 A similar approach was followed by Desmet and Wacziarg ( 2021 ) , who study the determinants of spatial variation in Covid - 19 across U . S . counties . They ﬁnd that contagion and mortality from Covid - 19 correlates with several variables , including , in particular , measures of what they call ‘e ﬀ ective’ population density . Our work complements their analysis , for we focus on the intergenerational di - mension of the household , and , as explained here below , we provide some element for an identiﬁcation , based on historical comparisons . Further - more , by using yearly data , focusing on mortality for both the elderly and the overall population , and using excess mortality among our robustness checks , we overcome several of the potential measurement issues in the previous literature as highlighted by Dowd et al . ( 2020 ) . A second contribution of this paper is to use past , pre - pandemic years to show that the positive correlation between mortality and intergenerational coresidence is somewhat speciﬁc to the Covid - 19 pandemic . Although we do not fully venture into causal inference , we interpret this as a kind of placebo test suggesting that the positive correlation we ﬁnd is not a statistical artefact . The outburst of Covid - 19 has determined a renewal of interest for the economics of pandemics . As stressed by Hauck ( 2018 ) , the transmission of infectious diseases crucially depends on social interactions , which in turn depend on human behaviour . The economists’ take on pandemics is that contrary to what is typically done in epidemiological models , human behaviour cannot be assumed as a given , for it is actually inﬂuenced by the presence and evolution of the infectious disease itself . Hence the need for an integration of epidemiological models ( which explain the evolution of the contagion given human behaviour ) and economic models ( which show how the contagion and the di ﬀ erent policies aimed at its mitigation inﬂuence social interactions ) . Examples of such integrated models include Adda ( 2016 ) , Brotherhood et al . ( 2020 ) , Burzy´nski et al . ( 2021 ) , Eichenbaum et al . ( 2020 ) , Favero et al . ( 2020 ) and the papers in the special 2021 issue on the economics of epidemics in the Journal of Mathematical Economics surveyed by Boucekkine et al . ( 2021 ) . Although we do not contribute explicitly to this literature , our work suggests that successful integrated 7 In the same spirit , using a sample of 300 communities making up the Los Angeles county , Harris ( 2021 ) ﬁnds that the transmission of Covid - 19 is higher in multigenerational families . 5 Jo u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof models should take the family structure into account . Understanding the interplay between family structure and a pandemic episode might have signiﬁcant policy implications . For instance , our work is relevant in the debate brought about by the Great Barrington Declaration in October 2020 on the “focused protection” of the elderly . In the light of our results , age - targeted lockdowns , as proposed for instance by Favero et al . ( 2020 ) to mitigate the economic impact of the Covid - 19 pandemic , might be more or less e ﬀ ective depending on the degree of intergenerational coresidence . On the whole , our work suggests that the explicit consideration of family structure might result in more accurate economic and epidemio - logical models of pandemics , thereby contributing to better inform policy decisions . The paper is organized as follows . In Section 2 , we provide a theoretical discussion of the link between intergenerational coresidence and mortal - ity , explaining the speciﬁcity of Covid - 19 . In Section 3 , we present our empirical analysis on Covid - 19 . In Section 4 , we discuss the relationship between intergenerational coresidence and all - causes and cause - speciﬁc mortality in past , pre - pandemic years . Finally , in Section 5 , we discuss the robustness of our results to di ﬀ erent deﬁnitions of intergenerational coresidence and alternative measures of mortality from Covid - 19 . Section 6 concludes . 2 A simple model of intergenerational coresi - dence and mortality In this Section , we rationalise in a reduced - form model the impact of inter - generational coresidence on mortality from a viral disease that transmits through aerosols and saliva droplets . The model is intended as a roadmap to interpret and qualify our cross - section analysis on Covid - 19 . 8 The probability of contagion , π , is a function of three elements : the age of the agent , ι = y , o , where y stands for young , and o for old ; the intergenerational coresidence status , κ , where κ = h ( for ‘household’ ) when there is coresidence , and κ = a ( for ‘alone’ ) when the young and the old live apart ; and the contacts outside home , c . Hence , 8 Since this empirical analysis is mainly static , integrating intergenerational coresidence in a ( dynamic ) SIR - type epidemiological model ( Avery et al . ( 2020 ) , Hethcote ( 2000 ) ) falls beyond our scope . 6 Jo u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof π ι , κ =  f ( c ι ) for κ = a f ( c ι , c − ι ) for κ = h ( 1 ) We assume that π is increasing in both arguments . The idea behind c − ι is that through coresidence , external contacts are indirectly shared among members of the household . It is reasonable to assume that c y > c o , i . e . the number of external contacts of the young is superior with respect to the number of external contacts of the old , due to a more intense social life ( working , leisurely activities . . . ) . Hence , for the young ( old ) the number of indirect contacts brought by coresidence with the old ( young ) represents a marginal ( im - portant ) increase with respect to their overall number of external contacts . Accordingly , we shall have π o , h > π o , a , ( 2 ) π y , h (cid:27) π y , a . ( 3 ) Thus , coresidence increases the probability of contagion for the old , but not for the young . There are N ι susceptible individuals of type ι in the economy , N ι , h of whom are coresiding with their o ﬀ spring / parent . Accordingly , the share of infected individuals of type ι , I ι , will be I ι = N ι , h N ι π ι , h + N ι − N ι , h N ι π ι , a . ( 4 ) Assuming that the lethality rate from the disease is α ι , the overall death rate of the age group ι associated with the disease reads δ ι = α ι I ι . ( 5 ) The overall death rate for the adult population then is δ = X ι ∈ [ y , o ] φ ι δ ι , ( 6 ) where φ ι is the share of group ι in the population . In this model , higher coresidence has an asymmetric impact by age , for it implies a higher contagion among the coresiding old , but not among the coresiding young . This higher contagion among the coresiding old translates into a sizeable increase of their death rate , provided that α o is high enough . For a pandemic that is particularly deadly for the old , 7 Jo u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof like Covid - 19 , we shall typically have a high α o . Hence , we expect that coresidence will have a positive e ﬀ ect on mortality of the elderly . This will translate into higher overall mortality depending on φ o , according to Equation ( 6 ) . 9 3 Intergenerational coresidence and mortality from Covid - 19 in 2020 Using the ( 2019 ) U . S . Census data ( Ruggles et al . ( 2021 ) ) , we build county - level intergenerational coresidence rates , deﬁned as the percentage of households in which there is an elderly parent ( 65 years old or more ) living with at least one adult child ( 18 - 64 ) . Our deﬁnition catches two elements that are key in our story : ﬁrst , the family dimension , limiting the e ﬃ cacy of preventive measures like masks and social distance ; and second , the demographic dimension , or the presence of old individuals for which Covid - 19 is particularly lethal . 10 In Figure 1 , we show the distribution of the intergenerational coresi - dence rate at the county level in 2019 . It ranges from 1 . 2 % to 12 . 5 % , with a median ( mean ) value of 5 . 3 % ( 5 . 37 % ) . In Figure 2 , we show the geographic variability of the intergenerational coresidence rate at the county level in 2019 . The top quartile of the dis - tribution is concentrated mostly in California , Florida , New Jersey , New York , and Texas . We build annual mortality rates from Covid - 19 for 2020 using county - level data from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( 2021a ) . We restrict the sample to the 426 U . S . counties available in the 2019 U . S . Cen - sus . 11 9 On the contrary , when the pandemic is particularly lethal for the young but not for the old , like the Spanish inﬂuenza , we shall have a low α o , and we expect intergenerational coresidence to have little e ﬀ ect on the overall mortality rate . The reasons why the Spanish inﬂuenza was not extremely lethal for the old are still debated in the medical literature . Short et al . ( 2018 ) suggests that previous infections might have made them immune to the virus . We investigate the association between intergenerational coresidence and mortality from the Spanish inﬂuenza in Appendix B . 10 Alternative deﬁnitions are discussed in Section 5 . 11 We use all available counties . Limiting the analysis to the metropolitan counties as deﬁned according to the National Center of Health Statistics ( NCHS ) ’s 2013 classiﬁca - tion ( Ingram and Franco ( 2014 ) ) does not change the results . Notice that this would excludes from the sample only 15 micropolitan counties , representing less than 6 % of the population . 8 Jo u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof 0 5 10 15 P e r c en t 2 . 00 4 . 00 6 . 00 8 . 00 10 . 00 12 . 00 Intergenerational coresidence rate Figure 1 : Intergenerational coresidence rate , distribution . 426 U .

We observe that there is wide variation across counties , with the mor - tality rate from Covid - 19 for the old ranging from 27 . 2 to 1622 . 1 deaths per 100 , 000 old persons . The median ( mean ) mortality rate is 480 . 8 ( 498 . 3 ) . In Figure 4 , we show the geographic variability of the mortality rate from Covid - 19 for the old at the county level in 2020 . The top quartile of the distribution is mostly concentrated in Illinois , Indiana , New Jersey , New York , Pennsylvania , and Texas . Comparison of Figures 3 and 4 gives the visual impression of a posi - tive ( unconditional ) correlation between intergenerational coresidence and mortality from Covid - 19 for the old at the county level . This is conﬁrmed by the scatter plot of the two variables in Figure 5 . 0 500 1000 1500 M o r t a li t y f r o m C o v i d − 19 : i n c i den c e a m ong pe r s on s aged 65 + 2 4 6 8 10 12 Intergenerational coresidence rate Figure 5 : Intergenerational coresidence and mortality from Covid - 19 among persons aged 65 + ( deaths per 100 , 000 persons ) , unconditional cor - relation . 426 U .

( 7 ) In Equation ( 7 ) , δ o is the mortality rate for the elderly , h is the intergen - erational coresidence rate , and X , z and D are controls . Subscripts i and j stand for county and state , respectively . The county - level controls in vector X include several potential confounders : i ) the share of college graduates in the adult population ( 25 years old or more ) , a measure of human capital and income ; ii ) the percentage of households who are proprietor of their 11 Jo u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof own house , a proxy for wealth ; iii ) the number of nursing home residents per 100 , 000 persons ; iv ) the unemployment rate , another proxy for income and economic conditions ; v ) the density of the population , to discriminate between family structure per se and density ; vi ) the percentage of votes for Trump in the 2016 Presidential election , supposedly catching potential mis - trust in the public sector , and hence in public recommentations against the pandemic ; vii ) the percentage of Hispanics and the percentage of Blacks , catching some ethno - cultural speciﬁcity . The state - level control z stands for the number of hospital beds per 100 , 000 persons . The variable D is a vector of geographical dummies computed alternatively at the Census division or the State level . They stand for generic idiosyncrasies at the geo - political level , including the policy response to the pandemic . When the regression includes state dummies , the state - level controls are turned o ﬀ , i . e . β 3 = 0 . 12 Controls were mostly chosen to catch possible omitted variables , i . e . variables that can a ﬀ ect both intergenerational coresidence and mortality . The level of human capital might a ﬀ ect the comprehension of diseases and the intake of preventive measures to contrast them . 13 Furthermore , human capital is a major determinant of income , which , together with wealth and the employment status should obviously improve living conditions and the access to medical services . 14 The latter also depends on the number of hospital beds , a stand - in for the availability of health - care facilities in the state , while the number of deaths in nursing homes have been an important share of the overall death toll from Covid - 19 ( Cronin and Evans ( 2020 ) ) . 15 Finally , cultural variables may have some explanatory power . Covid - 19 hit disproportionately ethnic minorities , Blacks and Hispanics in particu - lar ( Woolf et al . ( 2022 ) ) , while the higher resilience of Hispanics in terms of mortality is a known fact in the epidemiological literature ( Fenelon ( 2013 ) , Hummer et al . ( 2000 ) , among others ) . Moreover , a populist credo might have lowered the adherence of a non - negligible part of the population to 12 In order to control for possible co - morbidity factors linked to chronic diseases , we have also introduced the incidence of diabetes among the controls . While this reduces the sample size , results do not change appreciably . These and all the other results mentioned but not explicitly reported in the text are available upon request . 13 Our results also hold good using alternative measures of human capital , namely the average years of schooling and the percentage of high school dropouts , for individuals aged more than 25 . 14 Notice that we control for human capital , unemployment and wealth in our bench - mark regression , but not for income , because of multicollinearity . Results are however robust to introducing income as an additional control . 15 Our results also hold good by replacing the number of hospital beds with the per - centage of health workers . 12 Jo u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof the proposed measures of public health . For what concerns the impact of these variables on intergenerational coresidence , the economic and de - mographic literature mentioned in the Introduction suggests that income , employment status , wealth , and cultural norms are all major determinants of intergenerational coresidence .

As to the magnitude of this positive association , we note ﬁrst that the geographical level at which ﬁxed e ﬀ ects are computed ( division vs state ) have a small impact . Since public health policy decisions may have been taken at a more disaggregated level than the census division , we shall focus on the analysis with state dummies . Second , we have isolated the percentage of Hispanics from the other controls to single out the peculiar strong e ﬀ ect that this sub - group of the population turns out to have in our regressions . Adding the percentage of Hispanics as a control , indeed , reduces the e ﬀ ect of 13 Jo u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof intergenerational coresidence on mortality from Covid - 19 by more than a half . Nonetheless , such an impact remains quite sizeable . Our benchmark regression in column 4 shows that an increase in the intergenerational coresidence rate of 1 percentage point is associated with about 25 more deaths from Covid - 19 per 100 , 000 ( old ) persons , or an increase of about 5 % with respect to the mean mortality rate of the elderly . 16 In absolute terms , this corresponds to 14 , 109 individuals . 17 It might also be interesting to understand the time dynamics of Covid - 19 spreading across counties . Our theoretical argument , indeed , assumes that social contacts are unprotected both outside and inside the household . While this might be the case at the beginning of the pandemic , it is likely that this assumption becomes less compelling as the pandemic unfolds : social contacts outside the household become less and less regular , and the use of protective measures more widespread , due to public policy and individual prudence . Accordingly , we expect the positive relationship between intergenerational coresidence and mortality from Covid - 19 to be stronger in the early phases of the pandemic . To assess whether this was actually the case , we look at the quarterly cumulative mortality from Covid - 19 ( Centers for Disease Control and Pre - vention ( 2021a ) ) . In Figure 6 , we show the geographic variability of the cumulative mortality rate from Covid - 19 for the old at the county level in the four quarters of 2020 . From a visual inspection of the graphs , we notice that deaths from Covid - 19 were quite limited in the ﬁrst quarter ( Q1 ) of 2020 and concentrated in few counties only . In the second quarter ( Q2 ) , the disease spread across the U . S . territory , with higher incidence in the north - east . In Q3 and Q4 , we witness an overall di ﬀ usion across the counties . In order to assess the temporal pattern of the association between in - tergenerational coresidence and mortality from Covid - 19 , we run our re - gression ( 7 ) on the quarterly data . In Table 2 , we show the results of this regression for the second and the third quarter . 18 In accordance with our intuition , the magnitude of the positive association between intergen - 16 The mean mortality rate is about 498 . 17 This number is obtained by multiplying the coe ﬃ cient of the regression , which is expressed in per - 100 , 000 - old - persons terms , by the number of elderly in the population ( 55 , 811 , 000 ) , and dividing the result by 100 , 000 .

Looking at column 4 ( 8 ) , which represents our benchmark speciﬁcation , we see that in the second ( third ) quarter , a 1 percentage point increase in intergenerational coresidence im - plies about 48 ( 34 ) additional deaths from Covid - 19 per 100 , 000 elderly , which corresponds to 24 % ( 13 . 6 % ) of the mean mortality rate of the el - derly . 19 As reported in column ( 4 ) of Table 1 , at the end of 2020 , a 1 percentage point increase in intergenerational coresidence implies about 25 additional deaths from Covid - 19 per 100 , 000 elderly , which corresponds to 5 % of the mean mortality rate of the elderly . In the light of these results , one may be tempted to restrict the bench - mark analysis to cumulative mortality in the second quarter only . This might not be the most suitable approach , however , because focusing on the early phase of the pandemic might also make the analysis more suscep - tible to the possible randomness of the initial infection spread : Covid - 19 might have preponderantly stricken counties with high intergenerational coresidence only by chance . Carrying out an yearly analysis , as we do , mitigates this concern . Furthermore , as an additional robustness check , we run our benchmark regressions excluding the New York City counties , which were among the ﬁrst to be harshly hit by the pandemic and have very high intergenerational coresidence . Results are shown in Table 3 and are qualitatively similar to the benchmark regression of Table 1 . To wrap up , we ﬁnd a sizeable and signiﬁcant positive association between intergenerational coresidence and mortality from Covid - 19 , after controlling for several confounders . This holds true both at the yearly and the quarterly level . We are now going to discuss whether this association is speciﬁc to the Covid - 19 pandemic . 4 Intergenerational coresidence and mortality in pre - pandemic years In this Section , we investigate the association between intergenerational coresidence and mortality in the recent non - pandemic past . The idea is to verify whether the signiﬁcant and sizeable positive correlation we found between Covid - 19 mortality and intergenerational coresidence is somewhat speciﬁc to the Covid - 19 pandemic . In other words , we are 19 The mean mortality rate of the elderly is 204 in the second quarter and 252 in the third one . 16 Jo u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof Quarter 2 Quarter 3 ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 ) ( 8 ) % Int . cores . 54 . 74 * * * 45 . 63 * * * 61 . 58 * * * 48 . 83 * * * 54 . 77 * * * 33 . 89 * * * 56 . 15 * * * 34 . 24 * * * ( 7 . 830 ) ( 8 . 927 ) ( 8 . 125 ) ( 8 . 411 ) ( 7 . 167 ) ( 7 . 115 ) ( 7 . 200 ) ( 7 . 116 ) % Hispanics 2 . 89 * * 5 . 81 * * * 6 . 88 * * * 9 . 36 * * * ( 1 . 131 ) ( 1 . 155 ) ( 1 . 049 ) ( 1 . 076 ) County - level controls Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes State - level controls Yes Yes No No Yes Yes No No Census division FE Yes Yes No No Yes Yes No No State FE No No Yes Yes No No Yes Yes Observations 284 284 284 284 364 364 364 364 Adjusted R - squared 0 . 669 0 . 678 0 . 740 0 . 773 0 . 597 0 . 668 0 . 651 0 . 750 Robust standard errors in parentheses * * * p < 0 . 01 , * * p < 0 . 05 , * p < 0 . 1 Table 2 : Cumulative quarterly data , regression results .

All the explanatory variables in the regression are measured in 2019 as in Section 3 . What changes here is that mortality in 2019 is indepen - dent of the di ﬀ usion of Covid - 19 . Table 4 shows the results . The coe ﬃ cient of intergenerational coresidence is mostly negative and not signiﬁcant . 21 Interestingly , and di ﬀ erently from the Covid - 19 regressions , the coe ﬃ cient associated with the percentage of Hispanics now has a negative sign , in line with the well - known mortality advantage of the Hispanic population .

State - level controls include : number of hospital beds . As a second exercise , we enlarge the time window of the analysis to the interval 2005 - 2019 . Using county - level mortality rates from Centers for 20 In Appendix B , we extend the analysis further in the past , by considering the associa - tion between intergenerational coresidence and overall mortality in the decades between 1980 and 2010 , and during the Spanish inﬂuenza . Results conform to our main conclu - sions . 21 To grasp the quantitative magnitude of the coe ﬃ cient , notice that the mean mortality rate is about 3948 . 18 Jo u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof Disease Control and Prevention ( 2021a ) and Census data from Ruggles et al . ( 2021 ) , we build a balanced panel of 329 counties , for a total of 4 , 935 observations . 22 To control for time - invariant , county - speciﬁc characteris - tics that may a ﬀ ect mortality rates , we apply a Fixed E ﬀ ect estimator , with year dummies , to the following relationship : δ oi , t = β 0 + β 1 h i , t + β 2 X i , t + β 3 z j , t + (cid:15) i , t , ( 8 ) where all the variables have the same meaning as in Equation ( 7 ) . 23 Re - sults are reported in Table 5 . The association between intergenerational coresidence and mortality of the old turns out to be positive , but not signif - icant and quantitatively negligible . 24 This ﬁrst placebo exercise suggests that a sizeable , signiﬁcant , positive association between intergenerational coresidence and mortality for the old seems to be speciﬁc to the Covid - 19 pandemic .

However , it is not possible to retrieve observations by county for the years 2001 - 2004 . 23 We exclude the percentage of votes for Trump in the 2016 Presidential elections from the controls . 24 The mean mortality rate is 4662 . 19 Jo u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof 4 . 2 Mortality and intergenerational coresidence by type of disease To further investigate the matter , we are now going to look at the asso - ciation between intergenerational coresidence and mortality of the old in pre - pandemic years by type of disease . In particular , we select three causes of mortality : 1 ) mortality from circulatory diseases , 2 ) mortality from can - cer and 3 ) mortality from inﬂuenza and pneumonia . The rationale behind this comparison is that circulatory diseases and cancer are major causes of mortality , 25 while only inﬂuenza and pneumonia are transmitted via aero - bic contagion , thereby making them more directly comparable to Covid - 19 . We shall investigate the matter both in a cross - section analysis for 2019 and in the 2005 - 2019 panel . In Table 6 we show the results from the 2019 cross section analysis . The association between intergenerational coresidence and mortality of the old turns out to be always positive and signiﬁcant only for inﬂuenza and pneumonia . In the benchmark speciﬁcation of column 12 , a 1 percent - age point increase in intergenerational coresidence implies about 3 . 5 ad - ditional deaths from inﬂuenza and pneumonia per 100 , 000 elderly , which corresponds to about 5 % of the mean mortality rate of the elderly ( from inﬂuenza and pneumonia ) . 26 The magnitude of the e ﬀ ect of coresidence on mortality from inﬂuenza and pneumonia is thus close to the one from Covid - 19 . As to the mortality from cancer , the association with intergen - erational coresidence is always negative , mostly non - signiﬁcant and of a small magnitude ( with respect to the mean ) . 27 Finally , the association between mortality from circulatory diseases and intergenerational cores - idence is positive but mostly non - signiﬁcant and of a small magnitude ( with respect to the mean ) . 28 Table 7 displays the results obtained running equation 8 on 2005 - 2019 panel data for the three diseases : the coe ﬃ cient of intergenerational cores - idence is never signiﬁcant and quite small ( with respect to the mean ) . 29 To sum up , our placebo regressions provide some evidence of a positive , signiﬁcant and sizeable association between intergenerational coresidence and mortality only in the 2019 cross - section analysis for inﬂuenza and 25 They represent about 54 % of overall mortality for the elderly in 2019 . 26 In 2019 , the mean mortality rate of the elderly from inﬂuenza and pneumonia was about 65 . 27 The 2019 mean mortality rate for the elderly from cancer is 811 . 28 The 2019 mean mortality rate for the elderly from circulatory diseases is 1307 . 29 The mean mortality rate for the elderly is 1515 , 935 , 92 for circulatory diseases , cancer and inﬂuenza and pneumonia , respectively . 20 Jo u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof Circulatory Cancer Inﬂuenza and Pneumonia ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 ) ( 8 ) ( 9 ) ( 10 ) ( 11 ) ( 12 ) % Int . cores . 8 . 43 11 . 67 * 8 . 00 9 . 36 - 9 . 47 * * * - 4 . 35 - 6 . 46 * - 2 . 16 3 . 46 * * * 4 . 02 * * * 3 . 56 * * * 3 . 56 * * * ( 5 . 757 ) ( 6 . 345 ) ( 7 . 078 ) ( 7 . 381 ) ( 2 . 602 ) ( 2 . 995 ) ( 3 . 336 ) ( 3 . 377 ) ( 1 . 144 ) ( 1 . 377 ) ( 1 . 266 ) ( 1 . 367 ) % Hispanics - 1 . 00 - 0 . 56 - 1 . 57 * * * - 1 . 78 * * * - 0 . 17 0 . 00 ( 1 . 038 ) ( 1 . 089 ) ( 0 . 411 ) ( 0 . 537 ) ( 0 . 184 ) ( 0 . 178 ) County - level controls Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes State - level controls Yes Yes No No Yes Yes No No Yes Yes No No Census division FE Yes Yes No No Yes Yes No No Yes Yes No No State FE No No Yes Yes No No Yes Yes No No Yes Yes Observations 426 426 426 426 426 426 426 426 297 297 297 297 Adjusted R - squared 0 . 502 0 . 503 0 . 574 0 . 573 0 . 528 0 . 546 0 . 580 0 . 597 0 . 253 0 . 253 0 . 415 0 . 412 Robust standard errors in parentheses * * * p < 0 . 01 , * * p < 0 . 05 , * p < 0 . 1 Table 6 : Regression results .

Our benchmark analysis focuses on the mortality of elderly persons . One may wonder to what extent our results hold good when we extend the reference age cluster to include the whole population . This gives an appreciation of the overall magnitude of the association between intergen - erational coresidence and mortality from Covid - 19 , and makes our analysis more directly comparable to the literature . To do so , we regress mortality from Covid - 19 in the whole population 21 Jo u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof Circulatory Cancer Inﬂuenza and Pneumonia ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) % Int . cores . - 2 . 99 - 2 . 98 0 . 99 0 . 61 1 . 16 1 . 45 ( 2 . 824 ) ( 2 . 790 ) ( 1 . 355 ) ( 1 . 360 ) ( 1 . 017 ) ( 1 . 195 ) % Hispanics - 0 . 09 2 . 67 * - 1 . 65 ( 3 . 570 ) ( 1 . 487 ) ( 1 . 924 ) County - level controls Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes State - level controls Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes County FE Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Year FE Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Observations 4 , 935 4 , 935 4 , 935 4 , 935 4 , 106 4 , 106 Counties 329 329 329 329 325 325 Adjusted R - squared 0 . 747 0 . 747 0 . 666 0 . 666 0 . 277 0 . 279 Robust standard errors in parentheses * * * p < 0 . 01 , * * p < 0 . 05 , * p < 0 . 1 Table 7 : Regression results .

( i . e . without imposing any age restriction ) over the same set of variables described in Section 3 , plus the percentage of persons aged more than 64 , to control for the demographic structure of the population . 30 Results are reported in Table 8 . The coe ﬃ cient associated with intergenerational coresidence is posi - tive and signiﬁcant . From the benchmark speciﬁcation of column 4 , a one percentage point increase in intergenerational coresidence is associated with 6 . 6 additional deaths from Covid - 19 per 100 , 000 persons .

This allows to assess how much of the association between overall Covid - 19 mortality and intergen - 30 In a robustness exercise available upon request , we control for the percentage of persons aged more than 79 , instead of 64 .

It turns out that the elderly , who represent barely 17 % of the population , represents instead more than 65 % of the increase in the number of deaths due to a one percentage point increase in intergenerational coresidence . Dividing the increase in the number of deaths due to a one percentage point increase in intergen - erational coresidence by the overall number of deaths from Covid - 19 in 2020 gives the semi - elasticity of mortality from Covid - 19 with respect to intergenerational coresidence . This amounts to 6 . 17 % , and is directly com - parable to Aparicio Fenoll and Grossbard ( 2020 ) ’s cross - country analysis . The authors ﬁnd that one extra percentage point in the share of young individuals living with their parents is associated with additional deaths from Covid - 19 ranging between 2 . 4 % and 4 % . Possible measurement errors in the computation of mortality from Covid - 19 might be a concern for our benchmark analysis . There is in - deed a widespread feeling in the literature that mortality from Covid - 19 might be poorly estimated by o ﬃ cial ﬁgures ( see for instance Ackley et al . ( 2022 ) ) . One way to take this concern into account in our regression anal - ysis is to consider excess , as opposed to measured mortality as dependent variable . Excess mortality is typically estimated as the di ﬀ erence between actual mortality and some forecasted value based on past mortality . In the regressions , we use the excess mortality series estimated by Ackley et al . ( 2022 ) at the U . S . county level for the whole population . Results are re - ported in Table 9 and show conclusively that intergenerational coresidence is positively correlated with excess mortality from Covid - 19 . Looking at the benchmark speciﬁcation in column 4 , a one percentage point increase in intergenerational coresidence is associated with about 9 additional excess deaths , or an increase of 7 . 8 % with respect to the mean excess mortality rate . 32 5 . 2 Alternative deﬁnitions of intergenerational coresidence In this paper , we have deﬁned the intergenerational coresidence rate as the percentage of households in which there is an elderly parent ( 65 years old or more ) living with at least one adult child ( 18 - 64 ) . To ensure that our empirical results are not driven by possible idiosyn - crasies linked to this deﬁnition , we have run the same analysis presented in Table 1 using an alternative deﬁnition of intergenerational coresidence , namely the percentage of households in which there is an elderly parent ( 65 years old or more ) living with at least one young adult child ( 18 - 34 ) . With 32 In our sample , the mean excess mortality rate is 119 . 24 Jo u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof respect to the benchmark , this deﬁnition focuses more on the relatively young age of the adult child , while still catching the importance of having elderly parents . As shown in Table 10 , results are qualitatively similar , and even stronger from a quantitative point of view . ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) % Int . cores .

Aparicio Fenoll and Grossbard ( 2020 ) use yet another deﬁnition of the intergenerational coresidence rate , namely the fraction of young adults ( 18 - 34 ) living with their parents . Notice that this deﬁnition , like ours , catches the family link within the household , but , di ﬀ erently from ours , does not focus on the old age of the parents . We believe that our deﬁnition is more suitable to the purpose of this paper . For robustness , however , we have rerun our main regressions using Aparicio Fenoll and Grossbard ( 2020 ) ’s deﬁnition . Results are shown in Table 11 and are in line with our benchmark ﬁndings in Table 1 , for they show a positive and signiﬁ - cant association between intergenerational coresidence and mortality from Covid - 19 . Since this deﬁnition does not focus on the old age of the parents , the coe ﬃ cients are much smaller than in our benchmark analysis of Table 1 , as expected . The above - mentioned deﬁnitions catch coresidence among at least two generations , but are silent about how many additional generations may be actually involved .

( 2021 ) and select multigenerational households with three or more generations , and in which there is at least one elderly . Results are similar qualitatively and even stronger from a quantitative point of view , as can be witnessed by a look at Table 12 . 33 6 Conclusions In this paper , we investigate whether intergenerational coresidence may have been a mechanism fostering the transmission of Covid - 19 to the el - derly strata of the population . We present evidence that intergenerational coresidence is positively associated with mortality from Covid - 19 in a sample of 426 American counties in 2020 . The e ﬀ ect is statistically signif - 33 All the above deﬁnitions catch the extensive margin of integenerational coresidence , i . e . how many households have at least one elderly coresiding with at least one adult child . For the sake of simplicity , we abstract from the intensive margin of intergenerational coresidence , i . e . how many adult children live with how many elderly parents . As long as the intensity of coresidence correlates positively with the coresidence rate , this is a conservative assumption , for it implies that we are underestimating the impact of coresidence on mortality from Covid - 19 . In our sample , this is actually the case : the correlation coe ﬃ cient between our measure of intergenerational coresidence and average family ( household ) size is 0 . 51 ( 0 . 52 ) and is statistically signiﬁcant at the 1 % level . 26 Jo u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) % Int . cores .

County - level controls include : percentage of college graduates ( among persons aged 25 + ) ; percentage of dwelling owners ; number of nursing home residents ; percentage of unemployed ; percentage of votes for Trump in the 2016 Presidential election ; percentage of blacks ; density .

A one percentage point increase in the intergenerational coresidence rate is associated with 25 more deaths per 100 , 000 elderly persons due to Covid - 19 , that is , in absolute terms , 14 , 109 individuals . Results are robust to the inclusion of several socio - economic confounders , and the consideration of di ﬀ erent measures of mortality and intergenerational coresidence . The value added of our research is twofold . First , we are able to estab - lish the existence of a robust , positive correlation between intergenerational coresidence and mortality from Covid - 19 in a larger , more homogeneous sample relative to what is currently done in the literature . We show that this correlation is particularly strong for the elderly strata of the population . Second , we use history as a loose form of identiﬁcation . In particular , we rely on historical comparisons with pre - pandemic years ( 2005 - 2019 ) as a sort of placebo test , where no a - priori obvious correlation between intergenerational coresidence and mortality of the elderly is expected in non - pandemic years . We run this placebo analysis for both all - cause and cause - speciﬁc mortality . We show that a positive , sizeable , signiﬁcant association between intergenerational coresidence and mortality seems indeed to be speciﬁc to the Covid - 19 pandemic only . Although we focus on smaller geographical units than most of the 27 Jo u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof literature ( counties vs states / countries ) , still by construction our analysis remains eminently macro . This macro perspective makes it more di ﬃ cult to fully capture all the potential confounders , like for instance the health status of elderly , cultural factors such as religion , and psycological atti - tudes . To delve deeper into the relationship between family structure and the mortality from Covid - 19 or related pandemics , one would need in - dividual mortality data , matched with individual characteristics such as , age , living arrangements , social contacts , and other relevant demographic and socio - economic features . This would allow , for instance , to better enquire into those interactions between the elderly and their family mem - bers other than intergenerational coresidence , such as informal childcare by non - coresiding grandparents . In addition , our analysis shows that the percentage of Hispanics is strongly and positively correlated with both intergenerational coresidence and mortality from Covid - 19 , while being mostly negatively correlated with mortality from other causes and in other periods . Using individual - level data would allow to carry out the study for this sub - group of the population , thereby shedding more light on these correlations . Our research has potential policy implications worthy of further inves - tigation . For instance , it suggests that lockdowns targeted to speciﬁc de - mographic clusters ( e . g . the elderly ) might be less e ﬀ ective to mitigate the mortality from infectious diseases like Covid - 19 , in places where intergen - erational coresidence is particularly high . In this sense , our work speaks to the debate between the Great Barrington Declaration , which suggests the “focused protection” of the elderly , and the John Snow memorandum , which underlines its unfeasibility . Furthermore , on the ground of our analysis , one may wonder whether intergenerational coresidence should be taken into account in the ongoing debate over school closures during pandemics . In particular , the cost - to - beneﬁt ratio from school closures might be di ﬀ erent depending on whether intergenerational coresidence is high or low and whether it involves only two or more generations . These and other possible policy implications are left for future research .

Several studies analyse the determinants of within - country and cross - country variation of mortality rates during this pandemic episode . In particular , cross - sectional studies have shown that poverty , illiteracy and pollution contributed to the severity of the pandemic ( Clay et al . ( 2019 ) , Clay et al . ( 2018 ) Grantz et al . ( 2016 ) , Chowell et al . ( 2014 ) among others ) . Markel et al . ( 2007 ) and Bootsma and Ferguson ( 2007 ) ﬁnd that preventive measures such as quarantine and lockdown had a ( small ) negative impact on mortality . In this Section , we look at the experience of the 1918 Spanish inﬂuenza , which is a pandemic episode with transmission features similar to Covid - 19 , but a di ﬀ erent epidemiological impact by demographic cluster ( Beach et al . ( 2020 ) ) . Indeed , it witnessed an unusual age - speciﬁc incidence of mor - tality , with a peak for individuals aged 18 - 40 ( Taubenberger and Morens ( 2006 ) ) . Accordingly , we do not expect a sizeable , positive and signiﬁcant association between intergenerational coresidence and mortality from the Spanish inﬂuenza . In order to investigate whether this is the case , we build a cross - section of 423 American cities , using city - level mortality data from Clay et al . ( 2019 ) and U . S . 1910 Census data from Ruggles et al . ( 2021 ) . As a measure of mortality , we use the ( computed ) excess mortality rate allegedly due to the Spanish inﬂuenza from Clay et al . ( 2019 ) . 35 We computed city - level intergenerational coresidence rates from the Census . Figure 7 shows the relative frequency of the intergenerational cores - idence rate in 1910 . The distribution is slightly skewed to the right . It ranges from 0 % to 29 % ; the median ( mean ) is 8 . 9 ( 9 . 5 ) . A glance at Figures 1 and 7 suggests that intergenerational coresidence was on average higher and more volatile in 1910 than in 2019 . Figure 8 plots the relative frequency of the excess mortality rate in 1918 . It shows considerable variation across cities . Excess mortality ranges from - 144 . 7 to 1788 , with median ( mean ) 541 . 1 ( 567 . 5 ) . Given the data at our disposal , Equation ( 7 ) becomes 35 This variable is expressed in per 100 , 000 persons terms . City - level data on the number of casualties directly caused by the Spanish inﬂuenza are not available for our sample . 36 Jo u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof 0 5 10 15 % c i t i e s 0 10 20 30 Intergenerational coresidence rate Figure 7 : Intergenerational coresidence rate . 423 American cities , 1910 . 0 5 10 15 % c i t i e s 0 500 1000 1500 2000 Excess mortality rate Figure 8 : Excess mortality rate ( per 100 , 000 persons ) . 423 American cities , 1918 . 37 Jo u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof δ i , 1918 = β 0 + β 1 h i , 1910 + β 2 X i , 1910 + (cid:15) i . ( 9 ) In Equation ( 9 ) , δ is the excess mortality rate , h is the intergenerational coresidence rate , X is a vector of controls and i stands for city . In this regression , the controls in vector X include : i ) the demographic struc - ture , represented by share of old persons ( 65 years old or more ) in the population ; ii ) the illiteracy rate ; iii ) the percentage of households who are proprietor of their own house , a proxy for wealth ; iv ) density ; v ) percentage of health workers ; vi ) percentage of Blacks ; vii ) percentage of Hispanics ; viii ) percentage of employment in agriculture ; ix ) unemployment rate ; x ) geographical dummies . 36 Results are presented in Table 14 . They show that intergenerational coresidence rate is not signiﬁcantly associated with the excess mortality rate . Furthermore , the point estimate in the benchmark speciﬁcation in column 4 is quite small , 0 . 6 % of the sample mean . This may be interpreted as a consequence of its peculiar epidemiological pattern , in which , contrary to what experienced during the Covid - 19 pandemic , adults aged between 18 and 40 were disproportionately hit . The comparison of these results with those obtained in the analysis of the Covid - 19 pandemic suggests that intergenerational coresidence might be a mechanism fostering the transmission of this type of viral diseases from the young ( adults ) to the elderly . This translates into higher observed mortality only when the disease is particularly deadly for the elderly . 36 Due to the lack of data , we could not include the number of hospital beds and the number of nursing home residents among the controls . Furthermore , all controls are available only for 422 cities . 38 Jo u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Journal Pre - proof ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) % Int . cores . 2 . 57 2 . 48 3 . 26 3 . 17 ( 5 . 131 ) ( 5 . 105 ) ( 5 . 023 ) ( 4 . 968 ) % hispanics - 17 . 51 - 20 . 04 ( 11 . 814 ) ( 14 . 085 ) City - level controls Yes Yes Yes Yes Census division FE Yes Yes No No State FE No No Yes Yes Observations 422 422 422 422 Adjusted R - squared 0 . 230 0 . 232 0 . 299 0 . 301 Robust standard errors in parentheses * * * p < 0 . 01 , * * p < 0 . 05 , * p < 0 . 1 Table 14 : Regression results .
