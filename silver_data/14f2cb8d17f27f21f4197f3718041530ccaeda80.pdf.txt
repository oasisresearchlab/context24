Background and Aims . Bone is a highly vascularized tissue reliant on the close spatial and temporal connection between blood vessels and bone cells to maintain skeletal integ - rity . Considering the intricate connection between osteogenesis and angiogenesis , it is not surprising that communication between mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) and endothelial progenitor cells ( EPCs ) is one of the most important cellular interactions that orchestrates bone formation . The aim of this study was to evaluate the interaction of co - cultured bone marrow - derived endothelial progenitor cells ( BM e EPCs ) and mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) in angiogenesis and osteogenesis in vitro . Methods . MSCs and BM e EPCs were isolated from bone marrow of dogs’ iliac crest us - ing density gradient centrifugation combined with adhesion method and identiﬁed with surface markers , cell proliferation and immunocytochemistry in vitro . We used the direct contact method of MSCs and BM e EPCs in a co - culture system . Co - cultured cells and non - co - cultured cells were examined using the alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) activity assay , matrix mineralization assay , Matrigel 2D assay and gene expression . Results . ALP activity and calciﬁcation of nodules signiﬁcantly increased in the co - cultured cells compared with MSCs alone after day 3 , and tubulogenic activity of the co - cultured cells was also higher than BM e EPCs alone . Expression of bone and angio - genic markers were enhanced beyond expression levels of MSCs and BM e EPCs cultured alone . Conclusions . BM e EPCs co - cultured with MSCs can promote osteogenesis and angio - genesis . This co - cultured system may be broadly useful in engineering a variety of other tissue types . (cid:1) 2013 IMSS .

Introduction The repair of large bone defects remains a major clinical or - thopedic challenge . The engineering of bone tissue offers new therapeutic strategies to aid musculoskeletal healing ( 1 ) . One of the most widely tested tissue engineering approach for the repair and regeneration of bone defects has been the in vitro culture of a three - dimensional ( 3D ) scaffolding material seeded with autologous cells , followed by implantation in the patient ( 2 ) . Mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) are frequently used for bone tissue engineering and increasingly applied in the clinic ( 3 ) , but the size of the regenerated bone is limited by nutrient transport . Bone is a metabolically active tissue supplied by an intraosseous vasculature with osteocytes distancing no more than 100 m m from an intact capillary ( 4 ) . In the absence of a vascular supply , when the engineered tissue construct is implanted , the seeded cells will have a limited capacity to both uptake substrate molecules ( oxygen , glucose , and amino acids ) and to clear byproducts of metabolism ( CO 2 , lactate , and urea ) ( 2 ) . Thus , microvessels are essential for bone formation , metabolism , healing and remodeling . For these reasons , researchers have turned to the study of co - culture interactions with endothelial cells in the hope of Address reprint requests to : Zuolin Wang , The Afﬁliated Stomatology Hospital of Tongji University , No . 399 Middle Yan Chang Rd . , Zhabei Dis - trict , Shanghai 200072 , China ; Phone : ( þ 86 ) ( 21 ) 66313725 ; FAX : ( þ 86 ) ( 21 ) 66524025 ; E - mail : zuolinwang2013 @ gmail . com 0188 - 4409 / $ - see front matter .

In 1997 , Asahara et al . characterized endothelial progenitor cells ( EPCs ) in human peripheral blood using bead selection ( 5 ) . Compared with mature endothelial cells ( ECs ) , EPCs represent an exciting angiogenic , proliferative and survival potential in situ . Further , EPCs have been successfully iso - lated from a number of sources [ i . e . , peripheral blood ( PB ) , bone marrow ( BM ) , umbilical cord blood ] and may be expanded to achieve adequate cell numbers for tissue engi - neering applications without losing their endothelial cell phenotype ( 6 ) . Bone marrow - derived endothelial progenitor cells ( BM e EPCs ) are spindle - shaped cells capable of dif - ferentiation to a mature endothelial phenotype ( 7 ) . They are characterized by the expression of endothelial and stem cell markers such as vWF , PE e CAM - 1 ( CD31 ) , Cdh - 5 ( VE e cadherin ) , Tie - 2 , CD133 , Flk - 1 ( VEGFR - 2 ) and the hematopoietic stem cell marker CD34 , among others ( 8 ) . Their role in angiogenesis and neovascularization has been studied extensively both in vitro and in vivo ( 9 , 10 ) . On the basis of the observation that MSCs have received much attention from tissue engineering for their potential to regenerate bone and EPCs are mobilized in response to tis - sue injuries , we hypothesized that the co - culture system of MSCs and BM e EPCs may accelerate the establishment of a vascular supply and promote the formation of new bone . However , little is known about how two cells interact in bone tissue engineering . In this study we cultured EPCs and MSCs from bone marrow and then evaluated the inter - action of co - cultured BM e EPCs and MSCs in angiogenesis and osteogenesis in vitro . Materials and Methods Animals Healthy , adult beagle dogs aged 18 months old with an average weight of 12 . 5 kg were used as a cell source for MSCs and EPCs . The experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Care and Experiment Committee of Tongji Hospital Afﬁliated to Shanghai Tongji University , School of Medicine . Isolation and Culture of MSCs and EPCs from Dog Bone Marrow After administering general anesthesia on the dogs using an intravenous injection of pentobarbital nembutal 3 % ( 30 mg / kg ) , bone marrow was aspirated from the dogs’ iliac crest . MSCs and BM e EPCs were isolated from all heparinized BM aspirates by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll e Paque Plus ( GE Healthcare , Sweden ) according to the method previously reported ( 5 , 11 ) . MSCs and BM e EPCs were cultured in a - MEM medium and endothe - lial cell growth medium - 2 ( Lonza , h - FGF , IGF - 1 , h - VEGF , h - EGF , ascorbic acid , hydrocortisone acetate , concentra - tions not provided by manufacturer ) respectively . Fresh complete medium was added and replaced every 3 days . Cell viability and proliferation of MSCs and BM e EPCs were measured with a cell counting KIT - 8 ( CCK - 8 , Boster ) . Absorbance was measured at 450 nm . Cell number was correlated to optical density ( OD ) . Only cells in log - phase growth were used for the in vitro assays . For phenotypic characterization analysis , MSCs were incubated with antibodies including CD34 e PE ( eBio - science , USA ) , CD29 e PE ( Abcam , UK ) , CD44 e FITC ( eBioscience ) and CD90 e PE ( BD Biosciences ) at room temperature for 1 h , whereas BM e EPCs were incubated with antibodies including CD34 e PE ( eBioscience ) , CD133 e FITC ( eBioscience ) and VEGFR e 2 ( Abcam ) at room temperature for 1 h . Cell ﬂuorescence was evaluated by ﬂow cytometry . In Vitro Differentiation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells To identify the multipotency , MSCs used in the study were induced to differentiate into three lineages : bone , adipose , cartilage . Passage 2 MSCs were cultured in the osteogenic differentiation medium ( DMEM , 10 % FBS , 1 % penicillin e streptomycin , 10 nM dexamethasone , 50 m g / mL ascorbic acid , 10 mM b - glycerophosphate ) , adipo - cyte differentiation medium ( DMEM , 10 % FBS , 1 % penicillin e streptomycin , 1 mmol dexamethasone , 10 m g / mL insulin , 0 . 5 mmol IBMX , 0 . 1 mmol indomethacin ) and chondrogenic differentiation medium ( DMEM , 10 ng / mL TGF - b 3 , 200 m mol ascorbic acid ) respectively . For osteogenic differentiation , ALP activity was assayed using a BCIP / NBT alkaline phosphatase color develop - ment kit ( Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology ) . Calcium deposits were detected by staining with 2 % Alizarin red S ( Sigma ) . Oil red O ( Sigma ) staining was done to analyze adipogenesis . Chondrogenic pellets were formalin ﬁxed and parafﬁn embedded for Alcian blue stain . Immunocytochemistry To identify the EPCs used in the study , EPCs recognized as attaching spindle - shaped cells were assayed by co - staining with 1 , 1 0 - dioctadecyl - 3 , 3 , 3 0 , 3 0 e tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate - labeled acetylated low - density lipoprotein ( Dil - Ac - LDL ) and ﬂuorescein isothiocyanate - conjugated ulex europaeus lectin ( FITC e UEA e l ) , characteristics of endothe - lial lineage . Cells were observed under a ﬂuorescent micro - scope ( Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) . Immunoﬂuorescent staining of CD31 ( Boster Biotechnology ) was also used to assess endo - thelial cell phenotype of EPCs . CY3 and biotin - linked second - ary antibodies were used . Plate Colony Formation Assay Cell colony formation rate was measured using a plate col - ony formation assay . About 200 MSCs and BM e EPCs were , respectively , added to 60 - mm dishes . These dishes were incubated at 37 (cid:2) C in an incubator for 2 weeks . The 505 MSCs and EPCs in Co - culture Inﬂuence Osteogenesis and Angiogenesis colonies formed were stained with Giemsa solution ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) in methanol for 10 min . The colonies con - taining at least 50 cells were counted under a microscope . Colony formation rate 5 the amount of the colonies / the amount of the seeded cells . Co - culture of MSCs and BM e EPCs Prior to co - culture , MSCs were cultured in osteogenic media for 3 days . MSCs were then co - cultured with BM e EPCs at 1 : 1 co - culture ratios in a 1 : 1 mixture of oste - ogenic and angiogenic medium ( EGM - 2 ) on cell culture plates . For control conditions , non - co - cultured cells in their normal respective media were used . Speciﬁc test conditions for cellular expression studies are described in the following alkaline phosphatase activity assay , Matrigel 2D assay and gene expression ( real - time PCR ) sections . Alkaline Phosphatase Activity Assay Alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) substrate kit ( Wako , Japan ) was used in MSCs alone and co - cultured cells for 24 h , 3 days , 7 days and 14 days according to the manufacturer’s instruction . In addition , ALP activity was also detected in BM e EPCs alone . Brieﬂy , a set of cultured cells was washed with PBS , scraped , lysed by 0 . 05 % Triton (cid:3) 100 ( Sigma ) , and sonicated to destroy cell membranes . After centrifugation at 15 , 000 rpm for 10 min at 4 (cid:2) C , a 20 - m l su - pernatant sample was extracted from each sample and added to 100 m l freshly prepared substrate solution ( para - ni - trophenylphosphate solution ) . The mixture was shaken for 1 min by plate mixer and incubated at 37 (cid:2) C for 15 min . The enzymatic reaction was stopped by adding 80 m l stop solution ( 0 . 2 mol / l sodium hydroxide solution ) . Serial dilu - tions of p - nitrophenol solution served as standards . The absorption was measured at a wavelength of 405 nm . The results from ALP activity analyses were expressed in nano - moles ( nmol ) of p - nitrophenol produced per minute . Mineralized Nodule Analysis The mineralized nodules of cultured MSCs alone and co - cultured cells for 24 h , 3 days , 7 days and 14 days were determined by staining of Alizarin red S . Calcium deposits of BM e EPCs were also assayed . After staining , the cells were then incubated in 5 mL 0 . 1 mol / l cetylpyridinium chloride for 20 min at room temperature . The amount of mineralized nodules was determined by measuring absor - bance at 570 nm and calculated according to the standard curve . Matrigel 2D Assay Forty - eight - well plates were coated with Matrigel ( BD , USA ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and incubated at 37 (cid:2) C in an incubator for 1 h . BM e EPCs alone and co - cultured cells were then added to the 48 - well plates and incubated at 37 (cid:2) C . Network formation was observed using a phase contrast microscope . Gene Expression ( Real - time PCR ) Quantitative real - time PCR was employed to examine gene expression of key osteogenic markers ( collagen I [ Col I ] , osteocalcin [ OCN ] , insulin - like growth factor - 1 [ IGF - 1 ] and bone morphogenetic protein - 2 [ BMP - 2 ] ) and vasculo - genic markers ( vascular endothelial growth factor [ VEGF ] , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 [ VEGFR - 2 ] , IGF - 1 , and matrix metalloproteinases - 3 [ Mmp - 3 ] ) in MSCs alone , BM e EPCs alone or co - cultured cells for 24 h , 3 days , 7 days and 14 days in vitro . Brieﬂy , total RNA was isolated by adding 1 mL Trizol reagent ( Invitrogen , USA ) to mono - layer cells . One microgram of RNA from each sample was subjected to complementary DNA ( cDNA ) synthesis using Prime Script RT reagent kit ( Takala , Kyoto , Japan ) and Oligo ( dT ) Primer ( 25 pmol ) in a 20 - m l reaction volume according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Sybr Green - based real - time PCR analysis was carried out with the ABI Prism 7300 Sequence Detection System ( Applied Bio - systems , Foster City , CA ) . Thermocycling conditions were as follows : predenaturation at 95 (cid:2) C for 30 sec , ampliﬁca - tion with denaturation at 95 (cid:2) C for 5 sec , and annealing and extension at 60 (cid:2) C for 20 sec for duration of 40 cycles , with a ﬁnal dissociation cycle at 95 (cid:2) C for 15 sec , 58 (cid:2) C for 45 sec , and 95 (cid:2) C for 30 sec . Real - time PCR was carried out in triplicate with three independent experiments . Primer sequences are shown in Table 1 . Statistical Analysis All quantitative measurements were expressed as mean (cid:4) standard deviation ( SD ) . Statistical analyses were per - formed by the statistic software package SPSS 12 . 0 for Windows . Paired t test was used for statistical evaluation .

Results Identiﬁcation and Characterization of MSCs and BM e EPCs Mesenchymal stem cells showed ﬁbroblast - like morphology ( Figure 1A ) . We conﬁrmed the potential of MSCs to differ - entiate into osteoblasts , adipocytes , or chondrocytes and evaluated the expression patterns of germ layer markers in MSCs derived from bone marrow . Osteogenic differentiation assays showed that most of the cells had mineralized calcium deposits as conﬁrmed by ALP staining and Alizarin red S staining after 3 weeks of induction ( Figures 1B and 1C ) . The adipogenic differentiation of MSCs was veriﬁed by lipid droplets and positive Oil Red O staining after 4 weeks of mass culture and induction ( Figure 1D ) . The cells also had the capacity to undergo chondrogenic differentiation . This was evident through Alcian blue staining after induction for 4 weeks ( Figure 1E ) . Cell surface antigen phenotype was performed on MSCs by ﬂow cytometry ( Figure 1F ) . In many studies of dogs , CD29 , CD44 and CD90 are re - garded as positive cell - surface markers for MSCs ( 12 , 13 ) , whereas CD34 is considered as a negative surface marker ( 14 ) . The data showed that adhesion molecule protein CD29 ( 98 . 4 (cid:4) 0 . 36 % ) , receptor molecule protein CD44 ( 96 . 2 (cid:4) 0 . 12 % ) and CD90 ( 88 . 12 (cid:4) 0 . 96 % ) were highly ex - pressed in MSCs . The cells were negative for hematopoietic markers such as CD34 ( 0 . 033 (cid:4) 0 . 03 % ) . Through the growth curve of MSCs , the log phase was started after 3 days ( Figure 1G ) . Figure 2A displays the morphological change of BM e EPCs . Culture of total BM e EPCs resulted in the emergence of characteristic colonies consisting of periph - eral spindle - shaped cells emanating from round central . These colonies gradually disappeared and were replaced by characteristic spindle - shaped cells . After 12 days of cul - ture , these cells displayed cobblestone morphology and showed multiple population doublings without senescence , typical characteristics for late EPCs . The growth curve of BM e EPCs showed that the log phase with a greater incli - nation was started after 2 days ( Figure 2B ) . We further deﬁned that double - positive cells for FITC e UEA e I and Dil - ac - LDL , which were reported as endothelial cell line - age markers , were EPCs ( Figure 2C ) . Immunocytochem - istry was also used to analyze CD31 ( Figure 2D ) . Cell surface antigen phenotype was performed on MSCs by ﬂow cytometry ( Figure 2E ) . BM e EPCs display a low signal for CD34 ( 0 . 89 (cid:4) 0 . 26 % ) and CD133 ( 7 . 82 (cid:4) 0 . 83 % ) . On the other hand , BM e EPCs expressed high levels of VEGF - R2 . VEGF - R2 is a well - documented marker of EPCs as they have been showed to respond to angiogenic factor , VEGF , for proliferation and migration ( 8 ) . Colony Formation Rate of MSCs and BM e EPCs The seeded cells for tissue engineering are required to have a strong proliferative activity . To determine whether the cells were clonogenic , we generated and cultured single cell sus - pensions of MSCs and BM e EPCs . A portion of MSCs and BM e EPCs attached to the plate and remained quiescent for 3 e 5 days before they started rapidly dividing from colonies . After 12 e 14 days , colonies formed from single cells were visualized using Giemsa staining ( Figures 3A and 3B ) . The cell colony formation rate in MSCs group and BM e EPCs group was 36 . 23 (cid:4) 2 . 4 % and 48 . 8 (cid:4) 6 . 01 % , respectively ( Figure 3C ) , which was statistically signiﬁcant ( p # 0 . 05 ) . ALP Bioactivity and AR Staining ALP activity in MSCs alone and co - cultured cells was studied as an early marker of osteogenic differentiation . ALP activity was increased gradually in both groups during 14 days . At 24 h , ALP activity in both groups was not Figure 1 . Isolation and characterization of MSCs . ( A ) Morphology of MSCs at P2 .

However , MSCs cultured in OS medium showed lower ALP activity than co - cultured cells at 3 days , 7 days , 14 days ( Figure 4A ) . ALP activity of BM e EPCs was almost zero . Matrix mineralization was determined by assessing the destained amount of AR after AR staining . Calcium nod - ules did not appear in BM e EPCs . Staining with AR clearly demonstrated calcium nodule formation in MSCs alone and co - cultured cells at 24 h was not statistically signiﬁcant ( p O 0 . 05 ) . The amount of stained AR was obviously higher in the co - cultured group than MSCs group at 3 days , 7 days and 14 days ( Figure 4B ) . Matrigel Tube - like Formation Assay To assess the angiogenic ability of BM e EPCs ( control ) and co - cultured cells , we evaluated their capacity to form capillary - like networks in vitro . At 3 days , tubes were already present in both the control group and the co - cultured group ( Figures 5A and 5B ) . Meanwhile , the co - cultured group presented the higher tubulogenic activity , more than 2 - fold increase compared to the control group ( Figure 5C ) . Real - time PCR for Osteogenic and Vasculogenic Genes During a 14 - day Period Gene expression of certain osteogenic differentiation - related makers was demonstrated . Col I is the major protein in bone , constituting O 90 % of its total protein . It is highly expressed in the early stage of bone formation and consid - ered to be the important marker of bone formation and bone remodeling ( 15 ) . Col I was highly expressed in MSC - derived osteogenic cells and co - cultured cells . However , Figure 2 . Isolation and characterization of BM e EPCs .

It was consis - tent with ALP and AR detection . BMP - 2 is a differentiation factor , promoting MSCs to differentiate into bone - and cartilage - forming cells ( 16 ) . At 3 days , BMP - 2 expression of MSC - derived osteogenic cells was higher than the co - cultured cells . However , at 7 days and 14 days , the co - cultured cells displayed signiﬁcantly enhanced expression of BMP - 2 to the expression of that in MSC - derived osteo - genic cells ( Figure 6B ) . IGF - 1 is the most abundant growth factor that is deposited in the bone matrix throughout the mammalian lifetime ( 17 ) . The data showed that IGF - 1 level was signiﬁcantly increased in co - cultured cells compared to MSC - derived osteogenic cells after 3 days ( Figure 6C ) . OCN began to accumulate in the late stage of bone miner - alization , so at 24 h , 3 days and 7 days , OCN expression was very low in MSC - derived osteogenic cells and co - cultured cells . After 7 days , OCN expression of both MSC - derived osteogenic cells and co - cultured cells tended to ascend obviously , but the co - cultured group displayed signiﬁcantly enhanced expression of OCN to the expression of that in MSC - derived osteogenic cells ( Figure 6D ) . The effects of co - culture over vasculogenic genes were studied : the growth factors VEGF , VEGFR - 2 and IGF - 1 , matrix degradation / remodelation protein Mmp - 3 . VEGF was directly involved in angiogenesis . After 7 days , VEGF expression was signiﬁcantly upregulated in co - cultured cells in comparison to BM e EPCs alone ( Figure 6E ) . VEGFR - 2 , as the receptor of VEGF , the gene expression was signiﬁcantly enhanced in co - cultured cells compared to BM - EPCs during 14 days in vitro ( Figure 6F ) . After 3 days , IGF - 1 expression of co - cultured cells tended to ascend obviously , but the gene expression of BM - EPCs alone tended to descend . At 7 days and 14 days , IGF - 1 expression of co - cultured cells was obviously higher than BM e EPCs alone ( Figure 6G ) . Mmp - 3 expression at each time point was higher in co - cultured cells than BM e EPCs alone ( Figure 6H ) . Discussion Bone is a complex tissue and this is well presented in the multitude of cell populations that compose it . Hence , it is expected that the co - culture of heterogeneous cell types will recreate more closely in vivo environment than single cell cultures ( 18 ) . Communication between osteoblasts and ECs is one of the most important cellular interactions that orchestrates bone formation ( 19 , 20 ) . However , osteo - blasts and ECs are thought to be terminally differentiated cells and their proliferative capacity is limited ( 21 ) . At pre - sent , there are many studies in regard to MSCs therapeutic applications for autologous or allogeneic cell therapy , particularly in bone tissue engineering and wound healing ( 3 , 22 ) . EPCs are considered as candidates for vascular regeneration ( 9 , 10 ) . BM e EPCs have been successfully used for treating ischemia / reperfusion injury in animal models ( 23 ) . Both BM e EPCs and MSCs share their origin Figure 3 . Plate colony formation assay . ( A ) Morphology of a formed colony in MSCs and BM e EPCs .

( A color ﬁgure can be found in the online version of this article . ) 509 MSCs and EPCs in Co - culture Inﬂuence Osteogenesis and Angiogenesis in the bone marrow niche where they can interact with each other ( 24 ) . They are also present at sites of injured tissue such as regenerating bone or wound healing sites , and they are likely to establish direct cell contact under these condi - tions ( 25 ) . Therefore , this study used MSCs and BM e EPCs as seeded cells for bone tissue engineering . We investigated the time - dependent angiogenic and osteogenic interactions affecting BM e EPCs and MSCs in co - culture . As the seeded cells for bone tissue engineering , they need to have a strong proliferative capacity . MSCs are a particularly attractive source for osteogenic precursors for bone tissue engineering because they can be easily har - vested and expanded and induced to differentiate into bone - forming cells ( 26 ) . In this study , the colony - forming ability of BM - EPCs was higher compared with MSCs . This result shows that BM - EPCs have a strong self - renewal capability , which is the essential feature of the seeded cells of the tissue engineering . Additionally , in the co - cultured system , the proliferative capability of BM - EPCs was better than MSCs , but this would not reduce the osteogenesis of MSCs , which suggests that the co - cultured environment may favor osteogenic differentiation . Co - cultures with direct contact can be initiated on a 2D surface . With direct contact , all the mechanisms of cell to cell interaction are evaluated ( direct interaction through tight junctions , gap junction communications and secretion of paracrine factors ) ( 27 ) . Others have described that ECs may stimulate osteoblasts to express ALP and increase the production of COLI ( 28 e 30 ) . In the present study , BM e EPCs co - cultured with MSCs stimulated ALP activity and mineralization , and the expression of bone markers was improved . Yet , through ALP bioactivity and AR staining , BM e EPCs alone did not have the osteogenic ability . We deduced that the increase of ALP activity in the co - cultured cells did not come from EPCs . It is suggested that the co - cultured system may induce osteogenic differentia - tion of MSCs . The culture medium of the co - cultured group was supplemented with EGM - 2 , which contains factors such as VEGF , h - FGF and IGF - 1 . These growth factors are known to induce osteogenic differentiation of MSCs , which may account for the increased ALP activity observed in the co - cultured group . In addition , EPCs may release those growth factors continuously that contribute to recruit stem cells and to address them towards osteoblast differen - tiation . For instance , VEGF , the main angiogenic growth factor involved in bone healing and has an important role in bone repair by stimulating major skeletal cell popula - tions , chondrocytes , osteoblasts , and osteoclasts ( 31 ) . In this study , VEGF secreted by BM e EPCs may increase sur - vival and differentiation of MSCs because of both increased nutrient availability and signaling interactions between BM e EPCs and MSCs ( 32 ) . Moreover , treatment of endo - thelial cells with VEGF in vitro has been shown to result Figure 4 .

This suggests that in the co - cultured system , BM e EPCs may provide a local environment that favors osteogenic differentiation of MSCs . In addition , IGF - 1 is also a very important growth factor , which is expressed in both MSCs and BM e EPCs . It is a key factor in the endo - crine regulation of body composition and is pivotal not only to maintain bone mineral density ( 34 ) but also to enhance EPCs differentiation ( 35 ) . Interestingly , we found that IGF - 1 expression of the co - cultured cells was obviously enhanced after 3 days . Meanwhile , IGF - 1 expression of BM e EPCs tended to descend signiﬁcantly , and the gene expression of MSCs alone tended to ascend slightly . There - fore , the growth of IGF - 1 expression in the co - cultured cells was not only because of the elevated secretion of MSCs , Figure 6 .

( A color ﬁgure can be found in the online version of this article . ) 511 MSCs and EPCs in Co - culture Inﬂuence Osteogenesis and Angiogenesis which indicated that the co - cultured system may promote the secretion of IGF - 1 . This growth factor can generate an osteogenic microenvironment and induces the differenti - ation of recruited MSCs for new bone formation ( 36 ) . Hence , the co - cultured cells had a better osteogenic capability . There are a number of factors involved in neoangiogen - esis such as VEGF , VEGFR - 2 , IGF - 1 , which are the main protagonists and have angiogenic properties ( 37 ) . Other factors such as matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) can degrade extracellular matrix ( ECM ) facilitating EC migra - tion ( 38 ) . In this study , the result showed that the tubulo - genic activity was enhanced and the expression of the vasculogenic genes was improved . Mesenchymal progeni - tor cells from bone marrow can develop into endothelial cells and pericytes , thereby supporting the angiogenic pro - cess ( 39 , 40 ) . In the co - cultured group , some MSCs stimu - lated by some growth factors may differentiate into endothelial - like cells or vessel supporting cells . These MSCs participated in tube - like formation in a very similar manner to BM e EPCs , resulting in the high tubulogenic ac - tivity . Supernatants from MSCs were able to stimulate migration and formation of tubular structures of endothelial cells from capillaries and large vessels ( 41 ) . For the above reasons , co - cultured cells may secret more angiogenic growth factors . For instance , VEGF is a critical growth fac - tor necessary for blood vessel formation , and it signals through its tyrosine kinase receptor , VEGFR - 2 ( 42 ) . In this study , both VEGF and VEGFR - 2 experienced a signiﬁcant increase in the co - cultured system compared to in the BM e EPCs alone , suggesting that the angiogenesis of the co - cultured cells was increased . Furthermore , IGF - 1 is highly expressed in EPCs compared to mature endothelial cells or monocytes enhancing EPCs differentiation ( 35 ) . The data conﬁrmed that IGF - 1 expression of the co - cultured cells was signiﬁcantly increased compared to BM e EPCs alone . Angiogenesis is a sequential process ( 43 ) . It is initiated by degradation of the basement mem - brane . MMPs from EPCs have a pivotal role in the ischemia - induced neovascularization because they actively participate in matrix degradation ( 44 ) . At an initial stage of cell culture , EPCs secreted MMPs to degrade the extra - cellular matrix ( ECM ) and to initiate tube formation . The result showed that MMP - 3 expression was obviously higher in co - cultured cells than BM e EPCs alone . It was consistent with Matrigel tube - like formation assay . However , MMP - 3 expression was gradually descended over 14 days in both the co - cultured cells and BM e EPCs . The possible reason is that producing more ECM are not increasing degradation or remodeling of the matrix and the other factors , such as TGF - b 1 , may have involved more in the degradation or re - modeling of the matrix in the latter period ( 45 ) . In addition , VEGF expression of the co - cultured group was obviously higher than BM e EPCs alone . VEGF can stimulate expres - sion of MMPs , proliferation , migration , and tube formation of isolated endothelial cells in vitro ( 46 ) . The results sug - gest that the co - cultured cells can induce upregulation of the angiogenic growth factors and generate the favorable environment of angiogenesis . In summary , the result suggested that BM e EPCs co - cultured with MSCs can promote osteogenesis and angiogenesis . This co - cultured system may be broadly use - ful in engineering a variety of other tissue types because regeneration of all tissues is dependent on the interplay of various growth factors and cell types .
