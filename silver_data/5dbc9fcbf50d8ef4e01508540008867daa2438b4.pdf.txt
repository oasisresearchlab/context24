We present an infection prevention model for optimizing safe re - opening for elementary and secondary schools during the global COVID - 19 pandemic and review the current evidence behind various infection prevention interventions in school settings . The model is adapted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention fundamental pillars for infection prevention and includes 4 categories of intervention : epidemiologic controls ( town prevalence metrics , diagnostic testing , quarantine strategies ) , administrative controls ( state vaccination policies , alternative school models , symptom screens , quarantine breaks ) , engineering / environmental controls ( distancing , outdoor space , ventilation ) , and personal protective equipment ( PPE ) / hand hygiene ( face coverings , hand sanitizing ) . The adapted infection control pillars model utilizes implementation science – informed considerations to maximize pragmatism and adherence by leveraging evidence - based strategies . It highlights the necessity of redundant infection prevention interventions , acknowledges the importance of community buy - in to achieve real - world effectiveness , and addresses tactics to overcome imple - mentation barriers . Recommendations are grounded in the Dynamic Sustainability Framework and include suggestions to maintain infection prevention effectiveness over time to ensure ongoing safety . Keywords . COVID - 19 ; infection prevention ; implementation science . Schools are a critical part of societal infrastructure , with clos - ures estimated to cost between $ 10 and $ 47 billion per month in 2009 dollars [ 1 ] . Since March 2020 , coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) has disrupted education across the United States . Primary and secondary schools were abruptly closed , and in 48 / 50 states they remained closed for the duration of the aca - demic year [ 2 ] . At their peak , the closures affected at least 55 . 1 million students in 124 000 US public and private schools [ 3 ] . During the 2020 / 2021 academic year , many districts remain fully remote or in a hybrid model in which students are not fully in person for their education [ 4 ] . Women , particularly mothers of elementary school - aged children and women of color , are disproportionally impacted by school closing policies , due to a variety of factors , including lack of child care , the need to supervise remote education , and concerns about how they will be judged in the workplace [ 5 ] . These factors , among others , have led to women disproportionally exiting the workforce , furthering gender disparities [ 6 ] . Since the policy change was implemented in March 2020 , negative impacts of school closures on children , particularly underprivileged students , have been increasingly reported , both in academic journals and in the lay press [ 7 – 10 ] . Primary and secondary students who are placed in remote models or partially in - person ( hybrid ) models are falling behind academ - ically , as evidence increasingly demonstrates failure to achieve basic literacy and other key academic milestones [ 11 , 12 ] . Rates of childhood obesity and psychiatric illness in children and adolescents are on the rise , and recent reports suggest a pan - demic of mental health concerns , particularly among older stu - dents [ 13 – 17 ] . Initially , policies about opening schools in many districts ap - peared to be centered on the hope that a safe and effective vac - cine would be rapidly identified , with schools remaining closed until herd immunity was achieved through a nationwide mass vaccination campaign . However , the vaccine - based strategy will not be sufficient for the 2020 / 2021 school year , and as children aged < 16 years have not yet been part of large - scale studies , they will not be vaccinated by the start of the 2021 / 2022 year , rend - ering this strategy insufficient for next year as well [ 18 ] . Thus , applyparastyle “fig / / caption / p [ 1 ] ” parastyle “FigCapt” 2 • ofid • Schechter - Perkins et al it is critical that as we pursue a vaccination - based strategy to facilitate a safe return to school , we also consider the evidence supporting other infection prevention strategies in parallel to inform policy decisions about strategies to optimize the safety of school re - opening in a practical and feasible manner . Several guideline - issuing bodies have published recom - mendations about optimizing COVID - 19 prevention in school settings , including the World Health Organization [ 19 ] , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) [ 20 , 21 ] , and the American Academy of Pediatrics [ 22 ] . Each of these sets of recommendations emphasizes the importance of in - person education and delineates general severe acute respiratory syn - drome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) infection control princi - ples adapted for school settings . In December 2020 , the CDC updated its recommendations and stated that schools should be the last to close and the first to open—a critical and important policy change , indicating the importance of in - person learning [ 23 ] . However , available guidelines lack detail about the spe - cifics of how to implement infection prevention strategies [ 24 ] , creating challenges for school districts that must individually develop their own policies and procedures , while accounting for local barriers that may be specific to their own district , or even school building . Well - established infection control principles can be applied and adapted to nontraditional settings , including school build - ings . Experiences in other countries and districts that devel - oped strategies for opening classrooms to in - person learning during the pandemic can be used to inform best practices to support the safest possible elementary and secondary school re - opening . Here , we present an adapted infection prevention model for optimizing a safe re - opening for in - person learning in the setting of the global SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic for elementary and secondary schools , highlighting different infection prevention strategies and the evidence behind these strategies for imple - mentation and adaption in school settings . The model is based on the CDC’s Fundamental Pillars for Infection Control Model [ 25 ] , is grounded in the Dynamic Sustainability Framework [ 26 ] , and leverages evidence - based implementation strategies ( Figure 1 ) [ 27 ] . The Dynamic Sustainability Framework pro - vides a foundation for research , policy , and practice that sup - ports development and testing of falsifiable hypotheses and continued learning to advance the implementation , transport - ability , and impact of health services research [ 26 ] . The imple - mentation science – informed model [ 28 ] includes consideration of acceptability , feasibility , and sustainability , and the proposed plans are designed to be pragmatic and adaptable as data about COVID - 19 in school settings continue to evolve . In line with principles of implementation science , cost and feasibility at the local school district level are considered , and the evidence sup - porting different interventions is reviewed . THE ROLE OF SCHOOLS IN THE COVID - 19 PANDEMIC In March 2020 , based on information extrapolated from influ - enza transmission models , schools were closed as a strategy to reduce community transmission of COVID - 19 [ 29 ] . Since that time , data increasingly support the finding that children are less likely to become critically ill from COVID - 19 [ 30 ] . Additionally , although the magnitude of the role of children and schools in the spread of COVID - 19 remains controversial , children and schools do not appear to be the primary driver of the pandemic [ 31 ] . Thus , the impact of school closing for controlling com - munity COVID rates is likely not as great as the impact on closing schools for influenza control .

The infection control pillars for elementary and secondary schools . Infection Control for Return to School • ofid • 3 in the United States and other countries that have subsequently re - opened schools suggest that , in regions and districts with low community prevalence , schools that implement mitigation measures do not have high rates of within - school COVID - 19 transmission , although the risk is not 0 [ 32 – 36 ] . Surveillance testing in New York City suggests that in - school rates may in fact be lower than in surrounding communities [ 37 ] . In regions with high community prevalence , in - person schooling with mitigation measures still may be safer than the unregulated en - vironment that results from lack of structured in - person educa - tion and lack of supervision . For example , a recent case – control study from Mississippi found that children who became in - fected with SARS - CoV - 2 were more likely to have had attended gatherings with persons outside their household , including activities with other children , or to have had visitors in their home when compared with children who had not participated in these activities . Notably , attendance of in - person school 14 days before infection was not identified as a risk factor for SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 38 ] . The balance of evidence suggests that , with appropriate mitigation measures , transmission within school buildings can be minimized [ 39 – 41 ] . THE PILLARS OF INFECTION CONTROL Within infection control , there are several different classes of infection prevention interventions , previously described in the CDC Pillars of Infection Control Model , developed to guide responses to the H1N1 influenza pandemic ( URL no longer active ) ; these include epidemiologic controls , administrative controls , engineering / environmental controls , and personal protective equipment ( PPE ) and hand hygiene . Ideally , infec - tion control plans leverage interventions in each 1 of these categories and include redundancy , such that there is never reli - ance on only 1 infection control intervention to mitigate spread of infectious diseases . EPIDEMIOLOGIC CONTROLS Epidemiologic controls are interventions designed to decrease the likelihood of cases of COVID - 19 entering the building by focusing on the community around the school , as well as improving detection and early quarantining of cases to limit disease spread . Various epidemiologic controls for elementary and secondary settings with in - person learning include testing , contact tracing , and quarantining strategies . The first line of defense in preventing the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 within school buildings is controlling the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 in community settings . When community in - cidence is low , there is a correspondingly low probability that an infectious individual will enter a school building , thereby limiting transmission risk independent of any interventions adopted in school settings . In addition , when community case rates are low , few students and staff require quarantining , as they are less likely to be exposed to known cases , limiting the impact of infections on attendance and school staffing . Since early in the pandemic , guidelines have utilized closing and re - opening metrics based on rates of positive tests in the community surrounding a school or total number of cases / 10 000 persons in the past 7 days [ 21 , 42 , 43 ] . However , there is no con - sensus on which metrics should be used and what thresholds to set . As data have continued to evolve , scientific evidence sug - gests that the initially conservative metrics may be substantially relaxed , completely re - imagined , or removed entirely . Initially , the state of Massachusetts set a closure threshold of 5 % , and New York City 3 % [ 44 , 45 ] . France kept schools open despite an 11 % test positivity rate in the community [ 46 ] . Relaxation of closure thresholds is also supported by recent data from Italy , which found very low rates of transmission in day care settings and elementary schools ; the only large cluster occurred in a sec - ondary school setting [ 47 ] . From a practical standpoint , when the force of infection gets high due to community prevalence , it may be necessary for schools to close for in - person learning , due to either in - school transmission or inability to adequately staff a school building due to cases acquired outside of school , but impacting opera - tions inside of schools . Case ascertainment , with contact testing and quarantine if cases are identified , is a cornerstone of COVID - 19 epidemio - logic control [ 48 ] . Districts should develop plans to facilitate accessible and affordable COVID - 19 diagnostic testing , with a rapid turnaround time , for students and staff members who require testing in order to guide decisions about quarantining and staffing [ 49 ] . Ideally , testing should be accessible to cohort members of positive index cases as well , and these data should drive decisions about cohort and school quarantines . These measures are most effective when supported by resources out - side the school system . Beyond diagnostic testing , surveillance testing to identify asymptomatic cases is also a consideration , particularly for teachers and adolescent students , though there is no evidence that surveillance testing is essential for safe re - opening . Models for surveillance testing within schools could include partnering with local health care facilities or public – private partnerships with outside vendors to provide testing , as was successfully piloted in Wellesley , Massachusetts , although the cost of this program limits its practicality for widespread dissemination if additional resources are not made available to public school districts [ 50 ] . Recently the state of Massachusetts made pooled surveillance testing available to all public school districts state - wide for students and staff , with significant financial and logistical support [ 51 ] . Unless state or federal governments pro - vide funding for testing , the high costs associated with testing programs may disproportionately impact districts in poorer communities , already more impacted by the pandemic , without the means to support them . 4 • ofid • Schechter - Perkins et al ADMINISTRATIVE CONTROLS Administrative controls are policies and procedures designed to minimize the risk of exposure . They include govern - mental and local - level mandates designed to reduce disease transmission . State - Level State - level policies are an important administrative control that can support the re - opening of elementary and secondary schools . Phased re - openings , with careful consideration of which services should open , are critical for reducing SARS - CoV - 2 spread . In the United States , elementary and secondary schools were not prioritized during the phased re - opening , and other high - risk sectors of the economy , such as indoor restaurants , bars , and casinos , were permitted to open before schools ; reconsideration of what is included in which phase is a critical aspect of supporting in - person learning . The CDC update from December changed earlier priority rankings ; in this update schools were recommended to be the first to open and the last to close [ 20 , 23 ] . Within the different school structures , consideration may be given to prioritizing elementary schools , because younger children may be less likely to transmit disease [ 52 ] , they have the least observed risk of in - school transmission [ 53 ] , they are least able to participate in self - directed learning , and there is usu - ally only 1 homeroom teacher , resulting in reduced mixing of students and adults . However , although middle and high school models include more moving between classes and more mixing between students and adults , and thus poten - tially higher risk of COVID - 19 transmission when compared with elementary school settings , consideration should also be given to the recent reports of increased mental health con - cerns , including increasing rates of suicidal behavior in ado - lescents , when making school opening policy decisions for older students [ 16 , 54 ] . Mandatory influenza vaccination was implemented in health care settings several years ago as a cost - saving intervention [ 55 ] . Similar influenza vaccination policies can be mandated for children and school staff to limit co - infections and minimize testing and quarantining of individuals with symptoms that overlap with COVID - 19 . The Governor of Massachusetts an - nounced a first - in - the - nation mandatory influenza vaccination policy for all students , with limited exceptions [ 56 ] ; other states could consider similar mandatory vaccination policies . Those who did not or could not comply with recommended vaccin - ations were directed to a remote learning model , when avail - able . Given minimal circulating influenza in the community ( 14 cases reported to the state as of 2 / 5 / 2021 ) [ 57 ] , Massachusetts removed the influenza vaccine mandate for the 2020 / 2021 season , though it may require this vaccination again in future seasons . Local ( School District – Level ) To limit the number of potential person - to - person contacts and SARS - CoV - 2 exposures , the first administrative control is that only students and essential staff should be permitted into school buildings . This low - cost intervention reduces the number of people entering and exiting and thus reduces the chances that an individual infected with COVID - 19 will enter the building , potentially resulting in clusters of infections . Duration and proximity of contacts impact SARS - CoV - 2 transmission [ 58 ] ; thus , early recommendations highlighted the importance of physical distancing policies . However , the evidence about the effectiveness of distancing as an infection control strategy when implemented in school settings remains unclear . The CDC currently recommends maintaining 6 feet of physical distancing to the extent possible [ 21 ] , although the quality of evidence to support this recommendation is low . Conversely , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) recom - mends 1 meter ( 3 . 3 feet ) of distance between students [ 19 ] . The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends 3 – 6 feet [ 59 ] . Because of the differences in policy recommendations , dif - ferent countries and regions have adopted different distancing policies ( Table 1 ) [ 19 , 39 , 60 – 64 ] . These data do not suggest a major difference between regions with 3 vs 6 feet of distance . A recent analysis of data gathered from school districts across Massachusetts found that districts that returned to school at a minimum of 3 feet of distance did not report more cases of COVID - 19 among either students or staff than districts that returned to school at a minimum of 6 feet of distance [ 65 ] . Although additional direct comparative studies are needed to improve policy decisions , these data suggest that 3 feet of distancing can be adopted without negatively impacting stu - dent or staff safety , an important finding as 3 feet of distance is more feasible with existing school infrastructure . Evidence for relaxing distancing recommendations is strongest at the ele - mentary school level . Based on the currently available evidence , it is reasonable to implement different distancing policies for elementary , middle , and high school if other mitigation meas - ures , particularly universal masking , cannot be ensured . Multiple countries began to require 3 feet or 1 meter of distance between students [ 19 , 60 ] . When evidence showed that the distancing policy intervention did not significantly alter in - school spread or risk of transmission to teachers and school staff , some countries eliminated distance requirements completely [ 61 , 64 ] or transitioned to a “bubble” or cohorting model [ 60 , 62 , 66 ] , with small groups of students interacting but keeping the number of different contacts to a minimum . Before fall school re - opening , Northern Ireland changed its distancing guidance of 2 meters to 1 meter between school children , com - bined with using bubbles to minimize student interaction [ 67 ] . Cohorting students in educational settings to minimize interac - tion may be an effective way to limit disease transmission , and the current evidence for this is displayed in Table 2 .

Infection Control for Return to School • ofid • 7 Although data remain limited , it is reasonable to implement physical distancing requirements for higher - risk activities that take place during the course of the school day , such as during mealtimes or mask breaks [ 22 , 68 ] . For older students inher - ently at higher risk of transmitting disease and also of severe illness , greater distances for high - risk activities are a consid - eration until more evidence emerges . To keep school staff safe and limit spread to adults , who are at higher risk of severe com - plications of infection , adults should maintain at least 6 feet of distance from both students and other school staff at all times , including during breaktimes . Additionally , the impact of a distancing policy needs to be weighed against the negative im - pacts of the policy , which may preclude many districts from providing full , in - person education . In early school planning , many US districts implemented hybrid learning structures [ 69 , 70 ] in order to maintain max - imal physical distance between students , as well as to decrease a cohort size that might be considered contact if 1 member is identified as a case . There remains a theoretical concern that hybrid models may paradoxically lead to the highest transmis - sion among school - aged children [ 71 ] . This elevated transmis - sion rate may result from the reality that on “off” days , students comingle with students outside of their cohort and that infec - tion control measures implemented outside of the controlled school setting may be less rigorous than those implemented inside of school buildings . As data continue to emerge , it is crit - ical that communities and districts maintain the ability to adapt their plans and to change models to optimize safety . In - school activities may also have to be adjusted to support education . Choral singing has the potential to spread COVID - 19 [ 72 , 73 ] , and many school - based clusters have been reported secondary to sports practice and games [ 74 ] . Consideration should be given to moving these higher - risk activities outside , where natural airflow provides an additional layer of protection , or to canceling them entirely until additional prevention meas - ures are available . Presenteeism , or attending work / school when sick , is a major cause of clusters in health care settings [ 75 ] . Strategies to reduce presenteeism are critical for maintaining a safe school environ - ment . Policy modifications could include increasing sick pay , providing more robust backup / substitute capabilities so edu - cators do not fear overburdening their colleagues when they call out , or not deducting COVID - 19 - related absences from the individual’s bank of acquired sick days . Reconsideration of sick - leave policies has been demonstrated in hospital settings to reduce workplace clusters [ 76 ] . Symptom screens are a low - cost intervention that may limit presenteeism and therefore transmission [ 76 ] . To prevent in - fected individuals from entering school , before entry , a daily symptom , exposure , and travel screen should be completed by both school staff and students . Leveraging evidence - based im - plementation strategies [ 27 ] to enhance ease of use and promote adoption of this intervention , the screening platform should ideally be integrated into existing school technologic infra - structure . The screening tool should include an evaluation for symptoms potentially consistent with COVID - 19 , exposure to individuals who have recently tested positive , and out - of - state travel . Individuals who do not pass the screener should be in - structed not to participate in in - person education that day and be referred for additional evaluation , either by school nursing services or their personal physician , until cleared to return , which should be in line with current guidelines for clearance from isolation or quarantine [ 77 ] . Mandatory “COVID - 19 quarantine breaks” built into the school schedule are another consideration . Districts can con - sider eliminating in - person education for 7 – 10 days ( 1 full SARS - CoV - 2 quarantine period ) after a high - risk period , such as after major holidays . Schedule changes such as these might limit the potential for school - based clusters resulting in un - planned closures , but also must be balanced against the con - cern that students outside of schools may engage in high - risk activities , jeopardizing the intervention’s utility . Engineering / Environmental Controls Engineering and environmental controls , such as leveraging outdoor spaces and opening windows to improve ventilation , are another pillar of COVID - 19 risk mitigation . Research sug - gests that the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in outdoor spaces is substantially lower than in indoor settings , particu - larly those with poor ventilation [ 78 ] . Thus , outdoors spaces should be used , flexibly and to the extent feasible , particularly during warmer parts of the school year . Higher - risk activities , such as those that require mask removal , including eating and instrument or vocal practice , should take place outside when - ever possible , to leverage the increased air exchanges inherently provided by outdoor ventilation . To extend the amount of time spent in outdoor spaces , additional infrastructure , such as tents with heating elements , may also be pursued . Although building additional infrastructure is costly in the short run , if outdoor spaces are expanded enough , this might allow many schools to greatly expand in - person learning options , even if distancing requirements are maintained . Inside the buildings , identifying ways to optimize ventila - tion by increasing the number of air exchanges in classrooms and considering the use of air purifiers are important consid - erations . Based on modeling and engineering studies , windows should remain open to the extent feasible during the day , par - ticularly during higher - risk activities , such as during indoor mask breaks and during indoor mealtimes [ 79 , 80 ] . In colder weather , opening windows even a small amount may provide sufficient air exchanges to reduce viral presence [ 42 ] . If win - dows cannot be opened or there are no windows in a classroom , then air purifiers , such as HEPA filters , are another considera - tion . However , it is crucial to recognize that these interventions 8 • ofid • Schechter - Perkins et al are based on rational—but theoretical—evidence . Some studies have demonstrated reduced viral particles in the air after use of HEPA filters or improved ventilation in other settings ; how - ever , real - world data demonstrating a reduction in viral trans - mission are lacking [ 81 – 83 ] . Thus , inability to adopt ventilation interventions should not automatically preclude schools from opening . As the epidemiologic role of fomite - based transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 appears to be substantially less important than in - itially suspected [ 84 ] , enhanced cleaning and disinfection inter - ventions should be discontinued , in favor of standard cleaning policies . Further , strategies implemented early in the pandemic to reduce environmental spread , such as closing school play - grounds [ 85 ] , which are an outdoor shared space that is inher - ently safer than indoor spaces , should be discontinued . PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT / HAND HYGIENE PPE and hand hygiene strategies reduce the risk of infection in the event of exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 . Within health care and community settings , these strategies are critical for preventing spread . Further , modeling data and data from regions around the world about COVID - 19 transmission in school settings suggest that universal masking is an important intervention for preventing in - school spread and keeping schools open ( Table 3 ) [ 86 ] . The grade of mask necessary outside of hospital settings con - tinues to be an area of debate . The effectiveness of masking for the prevention of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission is a complex in - terplay of many factors and depends on the quality of filtration , the quality of fit , and fidelity ( adherence ) to the intervention . Consideration of all 3 factors must be taken into account when crafting sustainable and effective PPE policy . Mask Effectiveness = Filtration ∗ Fit ∗ Fidelity Ideally , teachers and school staff should be provided with high - quality masks , such as medical / surgical masks . Eye protection is an important aspect of the infection control response in health care and community settings , with some estimates suggesting that eye protection is associated with an 80 % reduction in the odds of contracting COVID - 19 [ 87 ] . Another time - series anal - ysis found a rapid and substantial reduction in in - hospital trans - mission after universal eye protection was added to universal masking [ 88 ] . Thus , devices that provide eye protection , such as face shields or goggles / safety glasses , should also be available for wear during in - person instruction . This level of protection is similar to what is provided for effective control in health care settings , including for interactions with COVID - 19 - positive pa - tients not undergoing aerosol - generating procedures . The PPE plan should consider practical , evidence - based con - siderations to optimize real - world effectiveness . Prior work in prevention of influenza demonstrates the importance of sus - tained compliance when leveraging PPE as an infection control strategy : In community settings , lower rates of self - adherence are associated with higher rates of infection [ 89 ] . Thus , to op - timize effectiveness of the masking approach , districts should use an implementation science – informed approach to masking to maximize adherence [ 27 ] . Considering the critical need to sustain compliance , students should be able to choose from a variety of options including cloth masks , surgical masks , and masks / face shields and may switch throughout the day to promote adherence [ 90 ] . Consideration of factors such as fit , comfort , training , and devices to support compliance ( such as button headbands ) are critical factors for promoting fidelity to the intervention and ultimately achieving and sustaining the benefits of PPE . In the real world , a choice that appears less than perfect in experimental and mannequin settings may be more effective due to improved compliance . To improve ad - herence at the level of an individual student , systems interven - tions such as the use of outside spaces for facilitation of safer and more frequent mask breaks may increase mask adherence in indoor classrooms , where the intervention is most critical for controlling spread . Hand hygiene campaigns are also fundamental to school re - opening infection control plans . Although current CDC guidance suggests that soap and water are preferred to hand sanitizer , cluster randomized controlled trials in school settings suggest that hand sanitizer is at least equivalent to , if not supe - rior to , soap and water , likely because hand sanitizer is faster and easier [ 91 , 92 ] . Considering this evidence , both hand sani - tizer and soap and water should be considered acceptable alter - natives , and education on both types of hand hygiene should be provided to students and staff . Sinks should be made available for soap and water use , for situations when hands are visibly soiled and hand sanitizer would not be appropriate . Hand sanitizing stations should be present throughout the buildings . Frequent sanitizing breaks should be encouraged , and the time required for sanitizing needs to be built into high - risk activities , such as before and after eating . BEYOND THE 4 PILLARS : POLITICS , IMPLEMENTATION , AND EMERGING SCIENCE Critical to the success of any school re - opening plan is a consider - ation of evidence - based implementation strategies and outcomes in order to ensure appropriate adoption of infection prevention interventions . Powell et al . highlight 73 evidence - based imple - mentation strategies [ 27 ] , many of which can be considered and leveraged to promote best infection control practices in school settings ; evidence - based implementation strategies in - clude educational programs , support , and engagement of local leaders and stakeholders , among many others . Recent data sug - gest that implementation plans that leverage multiple strategies simultaneously are associated with higher rates of a successful Infection Control for Return to School • ofid • 9 Tab l e 3 .

Thus , development of any infection control plan for safe re - opening of schools should be coupled with a com - prehensive and multifaceted implementation plan , leveraging as many implementation strategies as is feasible . Implementation strategies may include stakeholder , physician , and community engagement , educational campaigns , fundraising drives , and novel public – private partnerships , among others , to optimize the chances of a safe re - opening . Implementation Barriers and Challenges Although science and the basics of infection control can be used to develop safe school re - opening policies , underlying evidence about COVID - 19 mitigation is not the only factor driving the current school policy debate . Recently published data suggest that the strongest predictors of decisions about school opening are the political lean of a district and the strength of the local teachers union , with schools in Republican - leaning areas and with weaker unions far more likely to open than in Democratic - leaning areas with stronger unions , regardless of rates of community preva - lence or mitigation measures implemented in school settings [ 93 ] . A critical implementation barrier that has faced districts nation - wide has been a lack of trust , partly driven by the politicization of the debate , between parents advocating to re - open schools and teachers’ unions that may prefer to stay remote until both students and school staff are fully vaccinated against COVID - 19 . Medical professionals and scientific experts may have a role in bridging that mistrust . Medical and scientific professionals wishing to be - come involved may do so in many capacities , including advising the district on implementation and adoption of evidence - based infection control policies , volunteering to answer questions / ad - dress concerns from teachers / staff members , and providing ed - ucation on proper use of PPE and other mitigation strategies . By offering up their expertise , involved physicians have the ability to change the conversation from “whether to open schools” to “how to open schools safely . ” However , in volunteering , it is critical that medical and scientific experts recognize the limits of their expertise and consider feedback from local stakeholders when as - sisting in the development of evidence - based plans . The scientific community can provide critical feedback about evidence - based practices , but are not experts on education and must recognize the limits of their own knowledge base when providing infection control advice and support . Addressing Implementation Barriers and Challenges With Evidence - Informed Strategies In addition to relying on medical and scientific experts , schools could develop an educational campaign with identification of local thought leaders about the importance of masking and a guide for parents to use with their children who are struggling . Within the school , teachers and nurses should be engaged to encourage ongoing education and interactive campaigns to as - sist students and school staff in order to maintain effectiveness . In addition , specific interventions designed to promote compli - ance in high - risk settings , such as break rooms , should also be integrated into school re - opening plans . The Dynamic Sustainability Framework highlights a peren - nial challenge in implementation science work : The need for mechanisms to avoid “voltage drop” that may occur over time [ 26 ] . Some of the pillars of infection control , such as engineering controls , do not require day - to - day compliance , which is part of what makes them attractive . Vaccination programs are similarly attractive because they provide long - term protection without the need for sustainment on a day - to day - basis . However , others , such as hygiene protocols , PPE , and recommendations to maintain distancing at all times , particularly during break and mealtimes , are at high risk for “voltage drop , ” or decreasing rates of compliance—and therefore effectiveness—over time . Due to this risk , inherent in any safe re - opening plan is a con - sideration of strategies to maintain sustainability throughout the school year . Ongoing educational initiatives and use of ev - idence - based implementation strategies on a continual or in - termittent basis may be necessary to sustain necessary levels of compliance to provide protection . Creation of eating areas with limited seating , tape to delineate spaces , signage , or other strat - egies may be necessary to maintain compliance in the highest - risk settings [ 75 ] . Community - wide public health messaging from the school district must be ongoing in the town and the community , emphasizing the importance of community - level safe practices , such as continued masking and social distancing both , in order to keep the prevalence low in the town . In addition to considerations about sustainability , we must also recognize that evidence about SARS - CoV - 2 continues to evolve , and infection control strategies for school settings will require updates and adaptations as data continue to emerge . Epidemiologists , public health experts , and physicians may as - sist district administrators , who may have limited expertise in this area , with this ongoing process . The Evolving Science About COVID - 19 Vaccines and Considerations for School Re - opening Policies Much of the early school re - opening debate was based on hope of a vaccine . However , although vaccination and herd immu - nity are an important tool for supporting school re - opening , this strategy has many limitations . In late 2020 , the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices provided recommenda - tions for allocation of vaccine that prioritized those who work in the education sector ( teachers and support staff members ) to Phase 1B [ 94 ] . As of March 2021 , 3 vaccines have received Emergency Use Authorization within the United States ( 2 different 2 - dose mRNA vaccines and 1 single - dose , live adenovirus vaccine ) , with additional vaccine possibilities on the horizon [ 95 – 97 ] . However , manufacturing and distribution continue to be a chal - lenge in many regions . Infection Control for Return to School • ofid • 11 Vaccine availability has raised questions about when and how to open schools . Several different milestones have been discussed , including vaccination of teachers and vaccination of students , among others . Although teachers are prioritized in many vaccination schemes , children are very low on the pri - ority list [ 94 ] . Further confounding the question of how vaccine availability impacts school opening policy decisions , studies on vaccine efficacy in children have been delayed by limited enroll - ment ; thus , it is unclear when children will be vaccinated [ 98 ] . Because children will be among the last to be vaccinated , even if school staff are prioritized , concerns about children becoming infected at school , and potentially bringing the virus home , will continue to be present for the foreseeable future . This challenge is particularly acute for children who live with high - risk family members and those who live in multigenerational homes . Beyond questions about who can get vaccinated when , recent reports about the lack of effectiveness of 1 of the vaccines against an emerging strain in South Africa raise concerns that the virus may evade many of the currently developed vaccines , limiting the long - term viability of this “single - intervention” strategy as a tool to facilitate re - opening schools [ 99 ] . Thus , even with school staff vaccinated , mitigation measures will continue to be neces - sary in school settings for the foreseeable future . CONCLUSIONS School re - opening presents risks and promise for students , parents , and school staff . Maximizing the chances of successful opening requires leveraging every tool at our disposal and con - sidering the impact of policies on in - school and out - of - school transmission and risk . Data regarding COVID - 19 are constantly changing . Thus , school infection control plans must be flexible and adaptable , with the potential for revisions as additional re - search becomes available . This may mean relaxing some stand - ards or strengthening others as we continue to learn more about this novel pathogen . All of these risk mitigation strategies require strong sup - port from parents , teachers , local communities , and all levels of the state and federal government . Schools must be recog - nized as an essential service , and treated as such . Additionally , incidence of COVID - 19 is not the only relevant outcome— we must think more broadly about negative impacts that are both seen and unseen . If the critical importance of in - person learning is not recognized , children may be committed to remote learning for the foreseeable future , and although long - term data on the impacts of school closures will not be available immediately , early data suggest that the harms are dire and may take years to reverse .
