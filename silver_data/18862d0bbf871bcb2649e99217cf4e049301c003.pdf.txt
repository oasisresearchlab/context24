We aimed to compare the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID - 19 among 85 clinical staff in designated COVID - 19 units vs . that among staff in similar units 86 without known or suspected COVID - 19 patients . 87 Methods . We conducted a cross - sectional survey of healthcare workers ( HCW ) in 8 88 Israeli general hospitals . The survey involved a questionnaire and a PCR test for 89 SARS - CoV - 2 . We surveyed HCW in COVID - 19 units and comparison units ( internal 90 medicine and cardiology ) from April 30 - May 7 , 2020 . 91 Results . There were 522 participants : 291 from COVID - 19 units and 231 from 92 comparison units . Only one participant ( 0 . 2 % , 95 % CI : 0 . 005 % - 1 . 1 % ) tested positive 93 for SARS - CoV - 2 : an asymptomatic nurse on a COVID - 19 unit . In participating 94 COVID - 19 units there were two symptomatic HCW with confirmed COVID - 19 in the 95 two weeks before the survey ; both were infected by contact with a co - worker outside 96 of the COVID - 19 unit . 97 Conclusions . The low prevalence of asymptomatic COVID - 19 among HCW , coupled 98 with an absence of symptomatic COVID - 19 acquired during patient care , suggest that 99 Israel ' s national guidelines for personal protective equipment , which are consistent 100 with those of the World Health Organization , adequately protect HCW . 101 102 103 104 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 Introduction 105 Healthcare workers ( HCW ) caring for COVID - 19 patients are at high risk for 106 infection when personal protective equipment ( PPE ) is lacking or used inconsistently 107 [ 1 ] . In Italy as of June 19 , 2020 , there were 29 , 174 infected HCW , comprising 12 . 2 % 108 of all cases of nationwide [ 2 ] . As of June 23 , 2020 , the US Centers for Disease 109 Control ( CDC ) had reported 84 , 035 cases of COVID - 19 among HCW , comprising 110 19 . 6 % of all cases ; the true number was likely far higher , as only 21 . 7 % of case 111 reports indicated HCW status [ 3 ] . As of May 25 , 2020 , 272 HCW in England and 112 Wales had died from COVID - 19 . [ 4 ] . 113 In light of this high occupational morbidity , some have argued that PPE guidelines for 114 COVID - 19 are insufficient . For example , while the CDC [ 5 ] and World Health 115 Organization ( WHO ) [ 6 ] consider N95 ( or equivalent ) masks to be adequate 116 protection during aerosol - generating procedures , some HCW have called for use of 117 powered air - purifying respirators for these and other procedures [ 7 - 9 ] . Inadequate 118 protection of HCW against infection would place not only the HCW themselves at 119 risk , but also their patients . A study in one London hospital determined that 15 % of 120 inpatient COVID - 19 cases were definitely or probably hospital acquired ; 121 asymptomatic staff members were considered a potential source of infection [ 10 ] . 122 Mass testing of symptomatic and asymptomatic HCW has been recommended as a 123 means to reduce nosocomial transmission [ 11 ] . 124 In Israel , Ministry of Health ( MOH ) guidelines require HCW to wear a surgical mask 125 as a component of PPE when caring for COVID - 19 patients without severe infection 126 and an N95 mask when caring for COVID - 19 patients with severe infection or during 127 aerosol - generating procedures ( AGP ) , or when working in a designated COVID - 19 128 unit where some patients are likely to require AGP . Because the national policy is to 129 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 7 cohort COVID - 19 patients in designated wards and to triage possible COVID - 19 130 patients in specialized respiratory emergency departments ( EDs ) , most or all COVID - 131 19 patients in general hospitals are cared for by staff using N95 masks . In addition , in 132 order to prevent nosocomial transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 from asymptomatic 133 carriers , all other staff , patients , and visitors are required to wear a surgical mask . 134 We conducted a prevalence survey in which HCW were screened for SARS - CoV - 2 . 135 The state of the COVID - 19 epidemic in Israel around the time of our survey was as 136 follows : During the survey week , the daily incidence of COVID - 19 in Israel was low , 137 ranging from 0 . 4 to 1 . 6 cases per 100 , 000 population . On the first survey day , in the 8 138 participating hospitals there were 175 confirmed COVID - 19 inpatients ; 33 were 139 mechanically ventilated . In the two weeks before the survey , among the participating 140 COVID - 19 units , only one hospital had HCW in isolation with confirmed 141 symptomatic COVID - 19 . These were two HCW ; epidemiological investigation 142 determined that their infection source was unprotected contact with the same co - 143 worker outside of the patient care area ( unpublished data , Israel Ministry of Health ) . 144 Our aim was to compare the prevalence of asymptomatic COVID - 19 among clinical 145 staff in designated COVID - 19 units vs . that among staff in similar units without 146 known or suspected COVID - 19 patients . 147 148 Methods 149 Survey design and sample . The prevalence survey was conducted from April 30 - May 150 7 , 2020 , at 8 general hospitals comprising 5113 acute care beds ( 32 % of the national 151 total ) . The survey involved a questionnaire and a PCR test for SARS - CoV - 2 . We used 152 a convenience sample that included all HCW in the COVID - 19 units involved in 153 patient care who volunteered to participate , and a similar number of staff in 154 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 8 comparison units with no known or suspected COVID - 19 patients ( internal medicine 155 and cardiology ) . We classified HCW as working in a COVID - 19 unit if they had 156 worked at least 7 hours ( i . e . , nearly a full shift ) in the past 2 weeks in a COVID - 19 157 inpatient unit or respiratory ED . 158 Laboratory methods . Swabs were obtained for PCR testing according to each 159 participating hospital ' s protocol : one hospital took nasopharyngeal swabs ; six took 160 nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs ; and one took mid - turbinate nasal and 161 oropharyngeal swabs . The microbiology laboratory in each hospital processed its own 162 tests . 163 Statistical methods . To compare characteristics of HCW in COVID - 19 units vs . 164 comparison units , we used a chi - square or Fisher ' s exact test , or t - test . Analyses were 165 done using Stata 14 . 2 ( StataCorp , College Station , TX ) 166 Ethics . All participants volunteered for the survey and consented in writing . 167 Publication of results was approved by the jurisdictional institutional review board . 168 169 Results 170 There were 522 participants in our survey : 291 from COVID - 19 units and 231 from 171 comparison units . In the two weeks prior to being tested , these HCW provided a total 172 of 18 , 097 hours of COVID - 19 patient care : 18 , 058 hours of care by the COVID - 19 173 group ( a median of 64 hours per HCW ; interquartile range : 32 - 80 ) and 39 hours by 174 the comparison group . Participants ' characteristics are summarized in Table 1 . All but 175 2 HCW caring for COVID - 19 patients reported always using full PPE that included 176 gloves , waterproof gown , face shield , and N95 mask . 177 Only one participant ( 0 . 2 % , 95 % CI : 0 . 005 % - 1 . 1 % ) tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 178 on the day of the survey : an asymptomatic nurse on a COVID - 19 unit . An 179 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 epidemiological investigation was unable to pinpoint the source . The difference in 180 prevalence between COVID - 19 units and comparison units was 0 . 3 % ( 95 % CI : - 181 0 . 3 % - 1 . 0 % ) . 182 183 Discussion 184 In a cross - sectional survey of 522 HCW , we found a low prevalence of COVID - 19 . 185 This was true both for HCW providing patient care in COVID - 19 units and those 186 working in comparison units who might have been exposed to undiagnosed COVID - 187 19 patients . In addition to the one asymptomatic infected HCW detected in this 188 survey , in the two weeks before the survey there were 2 symptomatic infected HCW 189 detected in participating COVID - 19 units ; their infections were attributed to contact 190 with an infected co - worker . The combined findings of no symptomatic infections 191 acquired during patient care and one asymptomatic infection among extensively 192 exposed HCW provide evidence supporting the effectiveness of Israeli national PPE 193 policy , which consists of full PPE including an N95 mask when working in COVID - 194 19 inpatient wards where AGPs are performed , and universal surgical masks in other 195 hospital locations . Cohorting COVID - 19 patients in designated wards achieves three 196 goals : limiting patient - to - patient transmission ; simplifying HCWs ' decision - making 197 surrounding PPE use ; and preserving the limited supply of PPE . 198 Two findings from the questionnaire warrant intervention : 7 . 5 % ( 39 / 518 ) of HCW 199 who reported symptoms that could indicate COVID - 19 and 1 . 7 % ( 9 / 515 ) of HCW 200 who reported recent contact with a confirmed COVID - 19 case still went to work . 201 MOH guidelines require HCW to stay at home in both situations . Hospital 202 management must better communicate to its employees the risks they are posing to 203 patients and colleagues by presenteeism . 204 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 A limitation of our study is that PCR testing gives a snapshot of HCW COVID - 19 205 status only on the day of testing ; the prevalence of asymptomatic infection may have 206 been higher at other points in the pandemic . A second limitation is that the 207 questionnaire was not anonymous , creating the possibility of social desirability bias 208 when reporting compliance with prevention measures . 209 In summary , our findings of a low prevalence of asymptomatic COVID - 19 among 210 HCW , coupled with an absence of symptomatic COVID - 19 acquired during patient 211 care , suggest that Israel ' s national guidelines for personal protective equipment , which 212 are consistent with those of the WHO [ 6 ] , adequately protect HCW from infection 213 with SARS - CoV - 2 . 214 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 11 Authors ' contributions .
