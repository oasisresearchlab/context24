Supplemental Data Matters Arising Control of the Assembly of ATP - and ADP - Actin by Formins and Profilin David R . Kovar , Elizabeth S . Harris , Rachel Mahaffy , Henry N . Higgs , and Thomas D . Pollard Supplemental Experimental Procedures Plasmid Constructs Bacterial expression constructs containing both the FH1 and FH2 domains , fission yeast pET21a - Cdc12 ( 882 - 1390 ) , budding yeast pQE - 70 - Bni1 ( 1227 - 1766 ) , mouse pGEX - KT - mDia1 ( 549 - 1255 ) and mouse pGEX - KT - mDia2 ( 521 - 1171 ) , and containing the FH2 domain only , mouse pGEX - KT - mDia1 ( 748 - 1255 ) , of various formins have been described ( Kovar and Pollard , 2004 ; Li and Higgs , 2003 ; Li and Higgs , 2005 ) . An expression construct containing the full - length FH1 domain of mouse mDia1 ( accession number U96963 ) , pGEX - KT - mDia1 ( 549 - 1255FL ) , was made by cloning an RT - PCR - amplified product from murine Pre - B lymphoma cell RNA into pGEX - KText vector ( a gift from Jack Dixon ; Guan and Dixon , 1991 ) . Bacterial expression constructs for wild - type profilins , fission yeast pMW172 - SpPRF , budding yeast pMW172 - ScPRF and human pMW172 - HPRFI , have been described ( Eads et al . , 1998 ; Fedorov et al . , 1994 ; Lu and Pollard , 2001 ) . Expression constructs for mutant human profilins pMW172 - HPRF ( Y6D ) and pMW172 - HPRF ( R88E ) were made by PCR - amplification of wild - type human profilin with primers carrying the desired mutation . Protein Purification and Preparation GST - formin , formin - HIS , wild - type profilin and profilin mutant constructs were purified from bacteria as described ( Harris et al . , 2004 ; Kovar et al . , 2003 ; Kovar and Pollard , 2004 ; Kovar et al . , 2005 ; Li and Higgs , 2003 ; Li and Higgs , 2005 ; Lu and Pollard , 2001 ) . Ca - ATP actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle ( Kovar et al . , 2003 ) . Gel - filtered actin was labeled on Cys - 374 with Oregon green 488 iodoacetamide ( Molecular Probes ) ( Kovar et al . , 2003 ) , or on Lys residues with Alexa Flour 488 carboxylic acid succinimidyl ester ( Kellogg et al . , 1988 ) . For experiments with ATP - actin , Ca - ATP actin was converted immediately before each experiment to Mg - ATP actin by adding 0 . 2 vol of 1 mM EGTA and 0 . 25 mM MgCl 2 for 2 min at 25 ° C . Mg - ATP actin was converted to ADP actin with 20 u / mL hexokinase ( Sigma ) and 1 mM glucose for 3 hr at 4 ° C , and clarified for 1 hour at 125 , 000 X g ( Pollard , 1986 ) .

Analysis and Presentation of a Representative Time - Lapse Evanescent Wave Fluorescence Microscopy Experiment The spontaneous assembly of ATP - actin with mDia2 ( FH1FH2 ) . A mixture of 1 . 0 µ M ATP - actin , 0 . 5 µ M ATP - actin labeled with Oregon Green ( ATP - OG - actin ) and 1 nM mDia2 ( FH1FH2 ) was flowed into a chamber coated with NEM - myosin II and images were acquired every 15 seconds for 1200 sec . Conditions : 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 50 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 50 µ M CaCl 2 , 15 mM glucose , 20 µ g / mL catalase , 100 µ g / mL glucose oxidase , 0 . 5 % ( 4000 cP ) methylcellulose at 25ºC . This experiment is also shown in Figure 1 D - F . ( A ) Fluorescence micrograph of an entire 135 x 110 µ m field acquired 900 sec ( frame 60 ) after image acquisition began . A yellow box highlights a 35 x 35 µ m area , selected because it contains representative examples of two distinct filament populations . ( B ) Time series micrographs of the 35 x 35 µ m area boxed in ( A ) . Time in seconds is indicated at the lower right ( frames 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 and 75 ) . Three representative filaments are marked with wedges and triangles to specify barbed and pointed ends . ( C ) Kymographs of the filaments marked in ( B ) showing their lengths ( y axis ) at each of 60 frames over time ( x axis , 900 s ) . Filament 1 ( green ) is a control filament that elongated at its barbed end at a rate of 7 . 9 subunits / s , similar to filament barbed ends in control experiments without formin . Filament 2 ( red ) is a filament nucleated by mDia2 ( FH1FH2 ) that grew at a rate of 1 . 6 subunits / s during the entire 1200 s experiment . The fraction of filaments growing at this slower rate depended on the concentration of mDia2 ( FH1FH2 ) ( not shown ) . Filament 3 ( orange ) elongated at 1 . 5 subunits / s for ~ 800 s and then at 8 . 1 subunits / s for the remaining ~ 400 s . The simplest explanation is that mDia2 ( FH1FH2 ) nucleated filament 3 and remained persistently associated with the assembling barbed end until it dissociated at ~ 800 s . ( D ) Dependence of the percent of the total number of filaments that are elongating slowly at their barbed ends ( ~ 25 % the rate of control filaments ) , on the concentration of mDia2 ( FH1FH2 ) . ( E ) Lifetime plots of the growth of individual filaments vs . time . The lengths of randomly chosen filaments ( from the entire field ) were measured over time , and diverged into two populations based on their barbed end elongation rate . The left plot shows that control filaments assembled at 8 . 1 and 0 . 26 subunits / s at their barbed and pointed ends . At ~ 400 s one barbed end suddenly grew at less than 0 . 25 the rate of other control filaments . This is an example of an mDia2 ( FH1FH2 ) association event . The middle plot shows mDia2 ( FH1FH2 ) nucleated filaments which grew at 1 . 5 and 0 . 19 subunits / s at their barbed and pointed ends . The barbed end which suddenly grew at more than 4X the rate of other mDia2 ( FH1FH2 ) - nucleated filaments at ~ 800 s is an example of a mDia2 ( FH1FH2 ) dissociation event like filament 3 in ( C ) . The right plot directly compares the elongation of barbed ends of control and mDia2 ( FH1FH2 ) - nucleated filaments . Figure S2 .
