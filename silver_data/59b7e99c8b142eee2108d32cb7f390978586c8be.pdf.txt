The origin of high hydraulic resistance for ﬁlter cakes of deformable particles : cell - bed deformation or surface - layer effect ? M . Meireles ∗ , C . Molle , M . J . Clifton , P . Aimar Laboratoire de Génie Chimique , CNRS , UMR 5503 , Université Paul Sabatier , 118 Route de Narbonne , 31062 Toulouse Cedex , France Abstract This study reports a numerical approach for modeling the hydraulic resistance of a ﬁlter cake of deformable cells . First , a mechanical and osmotic model that describes the volume fraction of solids in a bed of yeast cells as a function of the compressive pressure it experiences is presented . The effects of pressure on the compressibility of yeast cells beds were further investigated both by ﬁltration experiments and by centrifugal experiments based on the multiple speed equilibrium sediment height technique . When comparing the latter measurements with compression model calculations , we observed that the method based on centrifugal experiments suffers from rapid relaxation of the compressed bed . Concerning the ﬁltration experiments , speciﬁc resistance of well - deﬁned bed of cells were calculated by a combination of the compression model with a formulation for hydraulic resistivity developed using the Lattice Boltzmann method . We further explain the experimental values observed for the hydraulic resistance of cell beds , assuming that the ﬁrst layer of cells in contact with the membrane partially blocks the membrane area open to ﬂow . In such a case , the blocked area seems to be a constant fraction of the normal cell – cell contact area .

Introduction Microﬁltration is an economical and efﬁcient technique for separating , from a liquid medium , particles ranging from one - tenth of a micrometer up to a few micrometers in size . This technique is used for concentrating slurries in the food , beverage and cosmetic industries and for separation of cells in the biotechnology industry . Although this method is widely used to separate deformable or soft particles in such various chemical and biochemical processes , the factors that affect the ﬁltration rate such as hydrodynamics , surface chemistry at particle surfaces and compressibility of cakes or particles are still not well understood or documented , and signiﬁcant error in the estimation of ﬁltration rate occurs when conventional ﬁltration theory is applied . ∗ Corresponding author .

The cake that builds up on the membrane surface plays a major role in operating performance as it controls the transient ﬂux decline . This latter is usually approximated by dead - end ﬁltration theory ( Redkar and Davis , 1993 ) , with the rate of ﬂux decline correlated to the amount deposited via the hydraulic resistance associated with the cake buildup . A large number of papers have been published that report the hydraulic resistance of ﬁlter cakes formed from biolog - ical suspensions such as microbial suspensions , yeast sus - pensions or red - blood - cell suspensions . Rushton and Khoo ( 1977 ) , Ofsthun ( 1989 ) , Nakanishi et al . ( 1987 ) , Nomura ( 1989 ) , Piron et al . ( 1995 ) , and Ogden and Davis ( 1990 ) have all measured the hydraulic resistance of deposits of baker’s yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) . Collected data vary in a ﬁ - nite range where variations can be ascribed to the differences in particle size , state of agglomeration , age , pH of liquors or the concentration of extracellular compounds . Despite these differences , much useful knowledge can be acquired by ex - amining results from all these different studies carried out 10 + 08 10 + 09 10 + 10 10 + 11 10 + 12 10 + 13 10 + 14 0 . 0 Piron Nomura Nakanishi Rushton Kozeny prediction ∆ P ( Operating Pressure ) 10 5 Pa α ( specific resistance of yeast cell beds ) m . kg - 1 Fig . 1 . Speciﬁc resistance of yeast cakes as a function of operating pressure . Data from Piron et al . ( 1995 ) , Nomura et al . ( 1984 ) , Nakanishi et al . ( 1987 ) and Rushton and Khee ( 1977 ) . Shown for comparison is the resistance calculated using the Carman – Kozeny equation ( Eq . ( 14 ) ) with a cell density (cid:1) c of 1130kg / m 3 , a cell diameter of 5 (cid:1) m and a solids volume fraction of 0 . 74 . with the same type of suspension . Fig . 1 gathers together some of these data for the speciﬁc resistance of baker’s yeast ﬁltered in the pressure range 0 – 400 kPa . We have also com - pared these data with values calculated using the traditional Carman – Kozeny equation assuming Stokes ﬂow through a granular bed of 5 (cid:1) m diameter particles ( which is close to the mean diameter for yeast particles ) and a void fraction of 0 . 27 corresponding to the maximum packing of a face - centered cubic array . As illustrated in Fig . 1 , the experimen - tal cake resistances for yeast are more than a hundred times higher than the values predicted . Experimental values also show a pressure dependence which is not accounted for by this simple equation . Most authors invoke the compressible nature of biological cells to explain the discrepancy between Carman – Kozeny predictions and experimental data , the calculated value being the lower limit when no compressive pressure is applied to the bed ( Piron et al . , 1995 ) . Indeed , developments in ﬁltration theory have aimed at providing detailed descriptions of ﬂuid motion though a ﬁl - ter cake due to a pressure gradient . This gradient causes an interfacial momentum transfer in the form of a viscous drag at the particle – ﬂuid interfaces . If the shape or strength of the particles is such that the packing arrangement cannot sus - tain this drag without further movement occurring then the cake is regarded as compressible . The modeling approaches involved to describe the inﬂuence of cake compressibility on ﬂow properties and volume fraction gradient in the cake have been well described in several papers , for example Tiller ( 1975 ) , Shirato et al . ( 1986 ) , Tiller et al . ( 1987 ) , and Sorensen et al . ( 1996 ) . If the compressible nature of many cakes is recognized in most of these works , the physical description of the forces acting on the packing rearrangement is still neither really un - derstood nor described . For the case of biological cells , two mechanisms can count as major sources of the increase in hydraulic resistance with pressure : an increase in area con - tact between the particles due to deformation or reorienta - tion by frictional drag and formation of a compact skin layer next to the membrane surface due to the mass of particles . This article is concerned with the physical interpretation of the values of speciﬁc resistance measured during ﬁltra - tion experiments of yeast suspensions for different operating pressures . This study treats the following points : • experimental observation of the behavior of yeast suspen - sions ( model suspensions ) under compressive loads ; • development of a realistic model for the mechanical prop - erties of a bed of yeast cells and their impact on its hy - draulic resistance for low porosity , with incorporation of a modiﬁed Carman – Kozeny equation , established by the Lattice Boltzmann method ; • integration of this model into an overall ﬁltration model and comparison with the experimental results ; and • discussion of the relative importance of cake and surface - layer contributions in controlling the hydraulic resistance . 2 . Theoretical development The model developed here has a certain similarity with a two - dimensional model for red blood cells proposed by Zydney et al . ( 1989 ) . They assumed that the cells could be represented by hexagonally packed discs with cell deforma - tion by ﬂattening in the regions of cell – cell contact . This deformation was further assumed to occur by stretching of the cell membrane at constant cell volume . In the present case , a three - dimensional structure is assumed and deforma - tion involves not only stretching of the membrane but also osmotic equilibrium . 2 . 1 . Geometry of cells as a function of mechanical load and osmotic stress In a series of recent publications , Smith et al . ( 1998 , 2000 ) and Smith et al . ( 2000 ) studied the mechanical properties of yeast cells . A slightly simpliﬁed version of their model is used here with the aim of providing a realistic description of the compressive deformation of yeast in the ﬁlter cake ; the content of this model is brieﬂy presented in Eqs . ( 1 ) – ( 8 ) . These authors found that the cell membrane is sufﬁciently permeable for an isolated cell to reach osmotic equilibrium in about 5 s . As we are interested in long - term behavior of the ﬁlter cake , we assume here that the cells are continually in osmotic equilibrium : (cid:2) p − (cid:2) (cid:2) = 0 , where (cid:2) p = p c − p l is the turgor pressure , i . e . the pressure difference between the cell interior and the surrounding liquid . This can be written as (cid:2) p + (cid:2) l − (cid:2) c = 0 . ( 1 ) If the osmotic pressure outside the cells (cid:2) l is increased , their volume diminishes and the situation is ﬁnally reached where (cid:2) p is abolished , i . e . the cell membrane is no longer under tension and then we have : (cid:2) c 0 = (cid:2) l 0 . According to Smith et al . ( 2000 ) , the value of (cid:2) c 0 is 2 . 1 MPa . Under these conditions , the cell volume is V c 0 , its surface area S c 0 and r 0 ( 2 . 51 (cid:1) m ) is the radius of a sphere having the same volume and surface area . A common hypothesis , also adopted by Smith et al . ( 2000 ) , is that the osmotic pressure inside the cells follows a form of the van’t Hoff equation : (cid:2) c ( V c − V n ) = (cid:2) c 0 ( V c 0 − V n ) . ( 2 ) Here V n is a non - osmotic volume , which is an important fraction of the volume V c 0 : V n = (cid:3) V c 0 and (cid:3) = 0 . 65 according to Smith et al . ( 2000 ) . By combining these equations , it is possible to obtain a relationship giving the cell volume that is ﬁxed by the osmotic equilibrium V c = V c 0 (cid:1) (cid:3) + (cid:2) c 0 1 − (cid:3) (cid:2) p + (cid:2) l (cid:2) . ( 3 ) On the other hand , the cell membrane is considered as extensible . The relationship between the tension T of the membrane ( assumed isotropic ) , the turgor pressure and the radius of curvature r is given by the Laplace equation (cid:2) p = 2 T r . ( 4 ) The membrane is assumed to be perfectly elastic , so the tension is proportional to the surface deformation : T = K S c − S c 0 S c 0 . ( 5 ) Here K is the surface modulus , whose value was deter - mined by Smith et al . ( 2000 ) to be 11 . 4 N m − 1 . Though these authors also studied a three - dimensional model of the cell membrane , we restrict our treatment here to the two - dimensional version and neglect any tension produced by membrane shear and ﬂexion . In this way it is possible to arrive at a relationship for the surface area of the cell as it is ﬁxed by the elastic stretching of the membrane S c = S c 0 (cid:1) 1 + r (cid:2) p 2 K (cid:2) . ( 6 ) Before considering the compressed cells , it is important to determine the internal pressure of a non - compressed spheri - cal cell of radius r . We deﬁne the ratio (cid:4) = r / r 0 . As V c / V c 0 = (cid:4) 3 , Eq . ( 3 ) can be put into the form : (cid:2) p (cid:6) = (cid:2) c 0 1 − (cid:3) (cid:4) 3 − (cid:3) − (cid:2) l . ( 7 ) Also as S c / S c 0 = (cid:4) 2 , Eq . ( 6 ) becomes (cid:2) p (cid:6) = 2 K (cid:4) r 0 ( (cid:4) 2 − 1 ) . ( 8 ) The value of (cid:4) is determined so that the two Eqs . ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) give the same turgor pressure (cid:2) p (cid:6) = p (cid:6) c − p l , correspond - ing to the value for non - compressed cells . We assume that in the case of compressed cells the total internal pressure is the sum of this initial pressure and the compressive pressure p s : p c = p (cid:6) c + p s . ( 9 ) The geometry of the compressed cells is then established by considering that the cells have a roughly spherical form , are of uniform size and are arranged in face - centered cubic packing . We assumed that under a compressive load , the sur - face of contact between two cells will no longer be spherical but ﬂat , while the untouched part of the cell retains a spher - ical shape : one can also think of the cells as represented by overlapping or interpenetrating spheres . To calculate the surface area and volume fraction of these cells , we consider a spherical envelope from which segments are removed and replaced by ﬂat areas : each sphere has 12 neighbors and will ‘lose’ 12 segments . If the distance between the centers of two neighboring cells is 2 a and r is the radius of curvature , then r / a can be thought of as a stretch ratio : it is equal to 1 for non - deformed cells and increases with increasing deformation . The volume of each cell V c is related to this ratio in the following manner : V c = 4 3 (cid:5) a 3 (cid:3) 9 (cid:4) r a (cid:5) 2 − 5 (cid:4) r a (cid:5) 3 − 3 (cid:6) . ( 10 ) The surface area of each cell is found in a similar way S c = 4 (cid:5) a 2 (cid:3) 6 r a − 2 (cid:4) r a (cid:5) 2 − 3 (cid:6) . ( 11 ) Face - centered cubic packing can be represented by a re - peating cube of side 2 a √ 2 that contains the volume of four cells . So the volume fraction of cells in this compressed packing is related to the stretch ratio as follows : (cid:6) = (cid:5) √ 2 (cid:3) 3 (cid:4) r a (cid:5) 2 − 5 3 (cid:4) r a (cid:5) 3 − 1 (cid:6) . ( 12 ) In the same way , the liquid – solid interface area per unit volume can be calculated as follows : S = (cid:5) a √ 2 (cid:3) 6 r a − 5 (cid:4) r a (cid:5) 2 (cid:6) . ( 13 ) This geometry remains permeable for values of r / a at which the ‘triangular’openings remain open : 1 (cid:1) r / a < 2 / √ 3 . It is worth noting that the model of Smith et al . ( 2000 ) contains four parameters (cid:2) c 0 , r 0 , (cid:3) and K that were deter - mined by these authors . Though their measurements did not claim to reach a high accuracy , we have used their values in the rest of this work . Fig . 2 . Flow diagram showing how Eqs . ( 3 ) and ( 6 ) – ( 15 ) can be used to determine hydraulic resistivity and solid cake fraction . 2 . 2 . Hydraulic resistivity of a porous medium at low porosity Even though cell membranes are found to be moderately permeable , the cells will be taken as constituting an imper - meable solid phase . The hydraulic resistivity of this porous medium can be represented using the Carman – Kozeny equa - tion r h = K 0 ( (cid:6) ) S 2 ( 1 − (cid:6) ) 3 . ( 14 ) It is know that at high volume fraction (cid:6) the value of K 0 increases strongly with (cid:6) ( Dullien , 1979 ) and it is quite inaccurate to use the traditional value for a bed of spherical particles . The hydraulic resistivity of this porous geometry was calculated by the Lattice Boltzmann method ( Succi , 2001 ) . This numerical technique for calculating ﬂow patterns is particularly well adapted to the complex geometries that are found in porous media . For this calculation , the three - dimensional image of the pore structure was a cube , 104 voxels in length . Periodic boundary conditions were imposed on all opposing faces , with a pressure jump between the two faces on the ﬂow direction . It was found that the results of this numerical calculation could be represented by a simple function in which the Kozeny coefﬁcient K 0 varies with (cid:6) in the following way ( Meireles et al . , 2002 ) : K 0 = (cid:3) a 0 + a 1 (cid:6) lim − (cid:6) (cid:6) . ( 15 ) Here (cid:6) lim is the volume fraction of solid phase for which the narrowest openings between cells are closed , so that the cake resistance tends towards inﬁnity . Fig . 2 is a ﬂow diagram showing how Eqs . ( 3 ) and ( 6 ) – ( 15 ) can be used to determine r h and (cid:6) as a function of p s . The numbers in the diagram are the equation numbers and the presence of several numbers in a single block indicates a simultaneous solution ; the values in the upper left - hand corner are parameters of the problem ( yeast properties and the osmotic pressure of the ﬁltrate ) . Because of the non - linearity of the system of equations a direct calculation is not possible : instead the ratio r / a is varied over the range of possible values ( from 1 up to a value for which the structure is almost closed ) and this allows calculation of (cid:6) , r h and p s . These values are tabulated and in subsequent calculations spline interpolations are used to calculate (cid:6) and r h from p s . 2 . 3 . Model for permeation The model for the mechanics of cell deformation and its effect on hydraulic resistivity has been incorporated into a permeation model that applies Darcy’s law : d p l d x = − r h (cid:8) u (cid:9) (cid:7) . ( 16 ) Here p l is the liquid pressure , x is the distance in the ﬂow direction , r h is the hydraulic resistivity , (cid:8) u (cid:9) is the superﬁcial velocity of the liquid ( an imposed value ) and (cid:7) its viscosity . On the basis of a force balance , the drop in liquid pressure is usually considered to be compensated by an increase in the compressive pressure in the solid p 0 = p s + p l . ( 17 ) The hydraulic resistivity is a function of the compressive pressure , which is related to the liquid pressure by Eq . ( 17 ) . The speciﬁc resistance of the cake (cid:8) is calculated accord - ing to the equation (cid:8) u (cid:9) = p 0 (cid:7) ( R m + (cid:8) m ) . ( 18 ) The speciﬁc resistance is related to the mass of “solids” in the cake ( including the water in the cells ) . The mass m of ﬁlter cake per unit membrane area is given by the integral m = (cid:7) X d 0 (cid:1) c (cid:6) d x / A . ( 19 ) This integration is performed numerically simultaneously with the resolution of Eq . ( 16 ) taking account of Eq . ( 17 ) and of the variation of r h and of (cid:6) with p s . The limiting conditions for Eq . ( 16 ) are as follows : at the upper surface of the cake , at x = 0 , p l is equal to the ﬁltration pressure p 0 and at the cake - membrane interface , at x = X d , p l = (cid:8) u (cid:9) (cid:7) R m . Here R m is the effective hydraulic resistance of the membrane and X d the cake thickness determined by integrating Eq . ( 16 ) for increasing x values until the experi - mental value for the mass of ﬁlter cake is reached . 3 . Materials and methods 3 . 1 . Yeast suspensions Suspensions of baker’s yeast S . cerevisiae were prepared from commercially available active dry yeast ( Lessaffre ) which were suspended in isotonic saline water ( 8 g / l NaCl , pH = 6 . 0 ) . During the rehydration process , soluble com - pounds can be released in the suspension . Rehydrated sus - pensions are thus centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min at 20 ◦ C ( Centrikon T - 124 , Kontron Instruments ) . The sediment is then collected and resuspended in isotonic saline water . This operation is repeated three times in order to remove the re - leased soluble species . The ﬁnal sediment is then collected and resuspended in isotonic saline water . The ﬁnal solution , designed as “washed solution” , free from soluble compounds is then constituted from yeast cells suspended in saline wa - ter . The density of washed rehydrated yeast cells (cid:1) c is equal to 1130 kg / m 3 . Yeast cells are ovoid particles : their mean particle diam - eter was determined using a Disk Centrifuge Particle Ana - lyzer ( Brookhaven Instruments Corporation , USA ) . A mean diameter of 5 ± 3 (cid:1) m was found . Observations with an op - tical microscope ( Axiolab A - Reﬂected Light Microscope , Zeiss , Germany ) revealed that “washed” cells are close to spherical particles , the size distribution observed being the result of some daughter cells present at the surface of a few yeast cells . Observations also conﬁrm that using the wash - ing procedure , all the cell debris had been removed . 3 . 2 . Filtration experiments and determination of speciﬁc resistance For a given hydrostatic pressure , we measured the speciﬁc resistance of ﬁltration cakes of a well - deﬁned mass . This was done by monitoring the permeate volume over time during ﬁltration of the suspension and by measuring the ﬂux at steady state with an isotonic saline solution . The experimental setup consists of a pressurized reser - voir ( Amicon ) , a 0 – 600 kPa pressure gauge ( AGA ) and a dead - end unstirred cell ( Amicon 8050 , Millipore ) which is a cylindrical vessel with a porous bottom plate acting as a membrane support . We used a 0 . 1 (cid:1) m acetate microﬁltra - tion membrane , 13 . 4 cm 2 in area ( Orelis , Saint Maurice de Beynost , France ) . Pressure was set in the range 30 – 300 kPa by means of compressed air and permeate mass was recorded on an electronic balance ( Precisa 1600 C - Oerlikon - 5 / 1600 g ) . A yeast suspension of known volume and initial concen - tration ( 1 g / l or 20 % ( v / v ) ) was placed in the ﬁltration cell and saline solution was continuously fed from the reser - voir to the cell under constant pressure . The suspension then forms a cake layer on the membrane . The optical clarity of the ﬂuid above the cake was checked to be sure that all the particles were deposited onto the cake . Each run consisted in setting the pressure drop across the membrane , measur - ing the permeate volume every 2 min during the cake build - up on the membrane and then measuring the permeate ﬂux when saline solution was ﬁltered through the cake layer . Permeate ﬂux decreased with time and reached a steady - state value once all the yeast had accumulated in the cake on the membrane . The superﬁcial permeation velocity is related to the variation in permeate volume according to (cid:8) u (cid:9) = 1 A d V d t . ( 20 ) Then , the speciﬁc resistance of the rehydrated cells cake can be calculated from the rate of variation in permeate volume using a variant of Eq . ( 18 ) : d V d t = Ap 0 (cid:7) ( R m + (cid:8) m ) . ( 21 ) Here R m is the hydraulic resistance of the clean membrane and ¯ (cid:8) is the experimentally determined speciﬁc resistance ; it is worth noting that ¯ (cid:8) is an average value that includes both bed deformation effects and surface layer effects . If the aver - age resistance ¯ (cid:8) is constant throughout the experiment , then Eq . ( 21 ) is valid both during the stationary phase when the cake is completely formed ( m is then a constant ) and during the initial phase of cake formation ( when m is variable ) . The mass of m rehydrated cells that has accumulated on the membrane per unit area can be calculated from the mass of dry yeast in the initial suspension C , m = (cid:9) CV / A , where (cid:9) is a proportionality constant ( (cid:9) = 1 . 8 as determined exper - imentally by Starov et al . , 2001 ) used to convert the yeast cell dry weight into the yeast cell rehydrated weight . Substitution of the latter expression in Eq . ( 21 ) gives the following relationship : d V d t = A 2 p 0 (cid:7) ( R m A + (cid:8)(cid:9) CV ) . ( 22 ) Integration of Eq . ( 22 ) gives the relationship for the tran - sitory phase t V = (cid:7) R m Ap 0 + ¯ (cid:8)(cid:9) C (cid:7) 2 A 2 p 0 V . ( 23 ) This is the traditional ﬁltration equation for constant pres - sure ﬁltration , very similar to Ruth’s equation ( Ruth , 1935 ) . Eq . ( 23 ) was used to determine the speciﬁc resistance of yeast cakes from experimental data in the transitory phase . Furthermore , Eq . ( 21 ) was used to calculate the value of the speciﬁc resistance during the stationary phase ( i . e . when all the yeast cells have accumulated in the cake ) , where the mass of deposited cells is known from the initial weight of cells according to m = (cid:9) CV f / A , with V f is equal to the total volume of permeate collected during the cake formation phase . In this work the values determined from the transitory phase were found to be consistent with the steady - state val - ues , and the latter are considered for the discussion . 0 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 20 0 . 25 0 . 30 0 . 35 0 . 40 0 . 45 0 . 50 0 . 55 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ln ( acceleration / m . s - 2 ) l n ( h e q / ho o / m ) Fig . 3 . Typical raw data generated by multiple - speed equilibrium sediment height technique for the determination of compressive yield stress . 3 . 3 . Compressibility : centrifugal measurement procedure The compressibility of the yeast cells was studied through a multiple - speed equilibrium sediment height ( MSESH ) technique ﬁrst developed by Buscall and White ( 1987 ) . This technique has been mainly used to determine in an accurate way the compression characteristics of mineral ﬂocculated suspensions ( Miller et al . , 1996 ) or to examine consolidation mechanisms during dewatering of ﬁne tail - ings ( DeKretser et al . , 1997 ) . In the MSESH technique a centrifuge is used to determine the compressive yield stress function p s ( (cid:6) ) , i . e . the force or pressure a network can sus - tain without undergoing a rearrangement . In this approach , the compressive yield stress is assumed to be an explicit function of solid volume fraction and an implicit function of the interparticle bridging force . The latter implicit function can be determined through different experimental proce - dures ( Miller et al . , 1996 ) . In this work , we have retained an MSESH technique that we brieﬂy describe here . Samples of cell suspensions of known initial volume and solids content are placed in cylindrical , transparent , ﬂat - bottomed centrifuge tubes and the equilibrium height h eq is measured for various increasing values of centrifugal ac - celeration at the bottom of the tube R (cid:10) 2 = Ng . The initial volume fraction of the suspension is assumed to be uniform throughout the tube . Raw data required are the initial height of the suspension , the density difference between solid and liquid phases and the centrifuge radius from the center to the base of the tube . A typical plot of h eq ( Ng ) is shown in Fig . 3 . The curves are linear when plotted on semi - logarithmic coordinates . The conversion of this raw data to a p s ( (cid:6) ) curve is not trivial . Buscall and White ( 1987 ) , Landman et al . ( 1988 ) and Green et al . ( 1996 ) after considerable work have developed a pro - cedure to estimate such constitutive equations for compress - ible beds . There are two routesto process the data : a full iterative al - gorithm and an approximate solution . It was shown that the approximate solution is acceptable if a limited number of 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 1 000 10 000 100 000 1 000 000 π ( o ) / Pa φ ( o ) Fig . 4 . Deformation of yeast cells under mechanical load from MSESH values experiments . Compressive pressure as a function of volume fraction of solids for pellets formed from rehydrated yeasts . data are available . The theory for these techniques is fully detailed in the above references and the basic equations for the approximate solution are given in Appendix A . As re - ported by Green and Boger ( 1997 ) a certain minimum cen - trifuge tube diameter must be used to minimize any possible wall effects , as narrow tubes may restrict the compressibility of the suspensions and generate unrealistically low results . A tube diameter of 24 mm was used for all experiments , the widest practical tube diameter for the results presented here . This does not mean that the wall effect is entirely elimi - nated using this tube diameter , but possible wall effects on the compressive behavior of the suspensions are minimized . 4 . Results 4 . 1 . Deformation of yeast cells under mechanical load We have measured the compressive yield stress for differ - ent solid fractions in the range 0 . 5 – 0 . 9 . It is seen in Fig . 4 that a solids fraction as high as 85 % can be reached for com - pressive yield stress in the range 10 – 50 kPa . These results are in good agreement with those discussed by Zydney et al . ( 1989 ) for red blood cells who found a solids fraction as high as 98 % for a compressive yield stress of 12 kPa . Yeast cell deformation has been observed during a slow drying process on a microscope slide through an optical microscope . Fig . 5 illustrates the deformation of yeast cells used in our study during such a drying process : this creates a hexagonal ar - rangement similar to that observed by Zydney et al . ( 1989 ) . 4 . 2 . Filtration results We determined the speciﬁc resistance of the cake ¯ (cid:8) from the variation of t / V versus the permeate volume V as de - tailed above . The membrane resistance R m during the ex - periment was obtained from the extrapolation of the data for V = 0 . The average speciﬁc resistance of the cake ¯ (cid:8) could also be determined from ﬁnal resistance ¯ (cid:8) m , that is observed when all the solid material in the suspension has Fig . 5 .

Deformation of yeast cells under mechanical load Fig . 7 shows a comparison between the deformation of yeast cells measured using centrifugal experiments based on the MSESH technique and the model described above with the values of the parameters determined by Smith et al . ( 2000 ) for (cid:2) c 0 , r 0 , (cid:3) and K . The experimental data ( points ) show less compression than is predicted by the model when using the published values of the parameters ( the continuous curve ) . A ﬁrst possibility to explain this is the uncertainty in the determination of the four parameters of the model : in - deed the published values have only a moderate precision . But we have tested that the behavior of the model is rela - tively insensitive to the values of these parameters ; this is illustrated by the dotted curve in Fig . 7 which was calculated after multiplying the surface modulus K by a factor of 2 . A more likely explanation lies in the fact that the cell deformation is largely reversible . So the bed of cells ini - tially compressed in the centrifuge may have time to ex - pand osmotically between the time when the centrifuge is stopped and the time when the measurement is made : a mat - ter of several minutes . As mentioned previously Smith et al . ( 2000 ) found that isolated cells reached osmotic equilibrium in about 5 s . For cells incorporated into a compressed bed , the transfer of water would be slowed by the small area of contact between cells and the aqueous phase and by the low permeability of the medium . Even so , it is possible that the Table 1 Calculated values of the fraction of membrane area blocked by cells from the ratio of clean membrane resistance to apparent membrane resistance ( Eq .

Indeed , McCarthy et al . ( 1999 ) discussed the existence of a reversible mech - anism in the compression of microbial cakes through cen - trifugation experiments suggesting that measurements made when the pellet has relaxed to a zero - compressive pressure state would underestimate cell compressibility . Finally , we also mentioned that there are two ways of treating the raw data : a full iterative algorithm and the ap - proximate solution that was used in this work . The use of the numerical procedure would certainly improve the pre - cision of the treatment , but this improvement is unlikely to cause important differences in the results . 5 . 2 . Speciﬁc hydraulic resistance In Fig . 6 , the calculated speciﬁc resistances are plotted against the ﬁltration pressure and compared with the exper - imental data . As shown , the calculated values are almost two orders of magnitude lower than the experimental ones . Also the calculated values show almost no variation with the pressure and at ﬁrst sight this can seem surprising for a compressible cake . The model presented above does in fact predict values of (cid:8) in the same range as the experimental values , but the compressive pressure in the cake would have to be quite high ( p s ≈ 0 . 9 bar ) . It is important to note that the compressive pressure is zero at the upper cake surface : so the top layer of cells is not compressed . Then deeper into the bed of cells and closer to the membrane , the compres - sive pressure increases as the hydraulic pressure in the liquid declines , according to Eq . ( 17 ) . The hydraulic resistance of the uppermost cells is not high enough to create a sufﬁcient pressure drop for there to be a strong compression of the cells closer to the membrane . In this way , the overall pres - sure drop calculated for this system is much lower than is observed experimentally . There is one point , however , that has not been included so far in our model : the effect of the ﬁrst cell layer , the one that is closest to the membrane . If we consider the results of our calculations as presented so far , the liquid pressure at that point is still quite high , with very little loss in the ﬁlter cake up to that point . The cells in the ﬁrst layer experience this hydraulic pressure everywhere except on the surface where they are in contact with the membrane : through that surface there is no ﬂow and no pressure drop , so the pressure they experience there is in fact the permeate pressure . Thus , the cells in the ﬁrst layer experience a much higher compressive pressure than the other cells , a compressive pressure equal to the hydraulic pressure near the membrane surface p l ( X d ) . Also part of their contact area is on the membrane , and this part of the membrane becomes impermeable . Already Zydney et al . ( 1989 ) considered a mechanism by which cells would block pores on the membrane surface , the extent of the blockage being almost independent of the compressive pressure for the red blood cells they were working with . In the present case , the yeast cells are more nearly spherical , so it would not be surprising if their contact area varied with the compressive pressure . The fraction of open membrane area (cid:11) can be calculated as the ratio of the resistance of the clean membrane to the apparent membrane resistance (cid:11) = R m ¯ R m = R m (cid:7) (cid:8) u (cid:9) p l ( X d ) . ( 24 ) It should be noted here that because of the low resistance of the ﬁlter cake , the hydraulic pressure at the membrane is almost equal to the applied ﬁltration pressure : p l ( X d ) ≈ p 0 . Calculations performed on the basis of Eq . ( 24 ) give values that decrease regularly with the applied pressure ( Table 1 ) : so the contact area of the cells with the membrane increases with increasing pressure . This can be put in parallel with the fact that cell – cell contact area also increases with increasing compressive pressure . For the cells in the ﬁrst layer part of the cell – cell contact should be replaced by cell – membrane contact , so the area of membrane blocked by cells should be proportional to their cell – cell contact area . The membrane area occupied by each cell in face - centered cubic packing depends on the orientation assumed by the packing . As shown in Fig . 8 for a ‘hexagonal’ plane lying on the membrane it would be 2 √ 3 a 2 , whereas for a ‘square’ plane it would be 4 a 2 : the two values are not very different . The cell – cell contact area per cell is 12 (cid:5) ( r 2 − a 2 ) . So the cell – cell contact per unit membrane area is 2 √ 3 (cid:5) ( r 2 / a 2 − 1 ) for the ‘hexagonal’ arrangement and 3 (cid:5) ( r 2 / a 2 − 1 ) for the ‘square’ arrangement : let us assume an intermediate value of 10 ( r 2 / a 2 − 1 ) . The ratio of this quantity to the calculated fraction of membrane area blocked by cells gives the Fig . 8 . Schematic representation of cell – cell contact area near the mem - brane . fraction of cell – cell contact . As shown in Table 1 , this frac - tion is independent of the compressive pressure ( applied pressure ) and is about 13 % . This value seems reasonable to explain the major part of the cake resistance can be ac - counted for by membrane - blocking mechanism in which the layer of cells in contact with the membrane experiences a compressive pressure almost equal to the ﬁltration pressure and the resulting cell – membrane contact area is simply a moderate fraction of the cell – cell contact area that the same cells would have in a uniform bed . 6 . Conclusion While there has been a large number of studies devoted to dead - end microbial ﬁltration in recent years , most of these have focused on empirical relations between rate of ﬁltra - tion and operating pressure and arrive at the conclusion that compressibility should be invoked . However , no such effects have been explicitly taken into account through a particle stress balance equation in the formulation of the problem . In the present work , experimental data on ﬁltration through yeast ﬁlter cakes have been compared with a mechanical model developed to describe the behavior of such a bed of deformable cells . We have also explored the possibility of using a multiple speed equilibrium sediment height technique to determine a compressive yield stress function . Here , the comparison between the experimental data and the mechanical model suggests that the centrifugal technique suffers from prob - lems related to the fairly rapid relaxation of the cell bed once compression is stopped . This technique could give bet - ter results with a centrifuge optically equipped to measure sediment height during compression . Unlike previous studies , the present work uses a mechan - ical model based on independent measurements to gain in - sight into the role of compressive pressure in packing ar - rangement and ﬂow properties of the ﬁlter cake . A modeling approach based on established theories for ﬂow in porous media and particle stress balance shows that the behavior of yeast - cell beds in terms of compressibility and hydraulic resistance can be taken into account . The results show that simply including a plausibly compressible bed is not sufﬁ - cient to explain the hydraulic resistance observed . However , the high compressive pressure experienced by the ﬁrst layer of cells in contact with the membrane can explain the re - sults if it is assumed that a constant fraction ( around 13 % ) of the contact area of the cells acts to reduce the membrane area open to ﬂow . Future work on ﬂow through cell beds of widely varying thickness would be valuable in testing this hypothesis as well as evaluating the inﬂuence of membrane porosity and cell surface properties one factor not discussed in this work but also known to change the compressibility of cells .

Noting r = R − x with (cid:12) = Ng = R (cid:10) 2 , yields d p s d x = − (cid:12) ( (cid:1) c − (cid:1) l ) (cid:6) ( x ) (cid:4) 1 − x R (cid:5) . ( A . 2 ) Buscall and White ( 1987 ) suggest applying this general Eq . ( A . 2 ) to the particular case of x = 0 , i . e . at the bottom of the tube as detailed below . A function X ( x ) is deﬁned as follows : X = (cid:7) h eq x (cid:4) 1 − x R (cid:5) d x = ( h eq − x ) (cid:1) 1 − h eq + x 2 R (cid:2) . ( A . 3 ) Eq . ( A . 2 ) can then be written as d p s (cid:6) = (cid:2) (cid:1)(cid:12) d X ( A . 4 ) and integrated to yield (cid:7) p s ( x ) 0 d p s (cid:6) ( p s ) = (cid:2) (cid:1)(cid:12) X ( x ) .

( A . 6 ) Differentiating Eq . ( A . 6 ) with respect to (cid:12) , we obtain (cid:6) ( 0 ) = d p s ( 0 ) d (cid:12) (cid:8)(cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:1) (cid:1) X ( 0 ) + (cid:12) d X ( 0 ) d (cid:12) (cid:2)(cid:6) . ( A . 7 ) From Eq . ( A . 6 ) , we can also put (cid:6) ( x ) = 1 (cid:2) (cid:1)(cid:12) d p s d X . ( A . 8 ) The mass balance (cid:9) h eq 0 (cid:6) d x = (cid:6) 0 h 0 can therefore be written as (cid:7) h eq 0 d p s d X d x = (cid:2) (cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:6) 0 h 0 . ( A . 9 ) Integrating this equation by parts we obtain p s ( 0 ) = (cid:2) (cid:1)(cid:12)(cid:6) 0 h 0 − (cid:13) ( (cid:12) ) ( A . 10 ) with (cid:13) ( (cid:12) ) = 1 R (cid:7) H eq 0 p s ( x ) ( 1 − x / R ) 2 d x . ( A . 11 ) Differentiating Eq . ( A . 10 ) with respect to (cid:12) , we obtain d p s ( 0 ) d (cid:12) = (cid:2) (cid:1)(cid:6) 0 h 0 − d (cid:13) d (cid:12) . ( A . 12 ) Substituting this result in Eq . ( A . 7 ) , we obtain (cid:6) ( 0 ) = (cid:1) (cid:6) 0 h 0 − 1 (cid:2) (cid:1) d (cid:13) d g (cid:2)(cid:8) (cid:1) X ( 0 ) + (cid:12) d X ( 0 ) d (cid:12) (cid:2) . ( A . 13 ) Eqs . ( A . 11 ) and ( A . 13 ) provide a way of determining the compressive pressure p s ( 0 ) and the volume fraction (cid:6) ( 0 ) at the bottom of the tube from the quantity (cid:13) . Buscall and White ( 1987 ) suggested an approximate so - lution to Eqs . ( A . 10 ) and ( A . 13 ) . It allows the compressive pressure and the volume fraction at the bottom of the tube to be calculated from the variation in the steady - state pellet height as a function of centrifugal acceleration p s ( 0 ) ≈ (cid:2) (cid:1)(cid:6) 0 h 0 (cid:12) (cid:1) 1 − h eq 2 R (cid:2) . ( A . 14 ) (cid:6) ( 0 ) ≈ (cid:6) 0 h 0 (cid:10) 1 − 12 R (cid:4) h eq + (cid:12) d h eq d (cid:12) (cid:5)(cid:11) (cid:4) h eq + (cid:12) d h eq d (cid:12) (cid:5) (cid:4) 1 − h eq R (cid:5) + h 2eq 2 R . ( A . 15 ) For a set of initial volume fractions (cid:6) 0 and volumes h 0 in the tube , we have determined the variation of h eq with centrifuge acceleration (cid:12) as shown in Fig . 8 . The quantity d h eq / d (cid:12) is therefore deﬁned as the slope of that curve for a given set of data . Green et al . ( 1996 ) have shown that this variation of h eq with (cid:12) when normalized with respect to initial conditions h 0 (cid:6) 0 follows a polynomial law . Here , the best adjustment is obtained with a polynomial function of the type ln (cid:1) h eq h 0 (cid:6) 0 (cid:2) = a 0 + a 1 ln (cid:12) + a 2 ( ln (cid:12) ) 2 + a 3 ( ln (cid:12) ) 3 , ( A . 16 ) with a 0 = − 0 . 671 ; a 1 = 0 . 427 ; a 2 = − 4 . 68 × 10 − 2 ; and a 3 = 1 . 39 × 10 − 3 . Applying Eq . ( A . 16 ) to each set of data ( h eq , (cid:12) ) , we could estimate the variation of d h eq / d (cid:12) for a large range of initial conditions ( (cid:6) 0 , h 0 ) .
