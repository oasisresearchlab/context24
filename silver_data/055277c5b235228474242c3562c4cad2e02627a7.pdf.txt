Brinkman , Tao Chen , Mario Amendola and Bas van Steensel * Division of Gene Regulation , Netherlands Cancer Institute , Plesmanlaan 121 , 1016 HM Amsterdam , the Netherlands Received September 5 , 2014 ; Accepted September 24 , 2014 ABSTRACT The efﬁcacy and the mutation spectrum of genome editing methods can vary substantially depending on the targeted sequence . A simple , quick assay to ac - curately characterize and quantify the induced mu - tations is therefore needed . Here we present TIDE , a method for this purpose that requires only a pair of PCR reactions and two standard capillary sequenc - ing runs . The sequence traces are then analyzed by a specially developed decomposition algorithm that identiﬁes the major induced mutations in the pro - jected editing site and accurately determines their frequency in a cell population . This method is cost - effective and quick , and it provides much more de - tailed information than current enzyme - based as - says . An interactive web tool for automated decom - position of the sequence traces is available . TIDE greatly facilitates the testing and rational design of genome editing strategies . INTRODUCTION Genome editing tools , such as TAL effector nucleases , zinc finger nucleases and RNA - guided endonucleases ( RGENs ) , enable targeted mutagenesis of a selected DNA sequence in genomes of many species ( 1 , 2 ) . In each of these meth - ods , introduction of an endonuclease with programmable sequence specificity into a pool of cells leads to a precisely defined DNA double - strand break ( DSB ) , which , when re - paired by non - homologous end - joining , results in a mixture of unaltered and mutated DNA . The latter consists primar - ily of a diversity of short deletions and ( more rarely ) short insertions that are centered round the break site ( 3 – 5 ) . Cells with a mutation of interest then need to be cloned in order to establish a stable mutant line . In order to implement this approach , it is usually neces - sary to test the efficacy of the programmable nuclease , which can vary dramatically depending on the sequence that is tar - geted . For example , with RGENs one typically needs to test several single - guide RNAs ( sgRNAs ) that are predicted to target the endonuclease to a gene of interest ( 6 ) . Commonly used assays to verify the efficacy of programmable nucleases are the enzymatic Surveyor and T7 endonuclease I cleav - age assays ( 7 , 8 ) , which detect small sequence changes . These methods are , however , semi - quantitative and suffer from high background signals when sequence polymorphisms are present . More importantly , these enzymatic assays do not provide insight into the nature and the diversity of the mu - tations that are introduced . This information is particularly useful if one needs to establish a clonal cell line with a spe - cific editing outcome , such as a defined deletion size that causes a specific frame shift in an open reading frame of in - terest , or that generates a subtle sequence change in a reg - ulatory element . To determine the frequency of the desired editing event in the pool of cells , one can amplify the tar - geted genomic region by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , clone individual DNA molecules in a bacterial vector and analyze 50 – 100 clones by sequencing . This approach is labor - intensive , time - consuming and relatively costly . High - throughput sequencing around the induced break site ( 9 ) is a powerful alternative , but is also expensive and usually takes several weeks in most research environments . Here , we present a simple , rapid and cost - effective strat - egy that accurately quantifies the editing efficacy and simul - taneously identifies the predominant types of insertions and deletions ( indels ) in the targeted pool of cells . The method , named TIDE ( Tracking of Indels by DEcomposition ) , re - quires only two parallel PCR reactions followed by a pair of standard capillary sequencing analyses . The two result - ing sequencing traces are then analyzed using specially de - signed software that we provide as a simple web tool and as R code ( both available at http : / / tide . nki . nl ) .

This cell pool also includes cells that that were not transduced and do not express GFP at all . For transient transfection with CRISPR vectors , 1 × 10 6 K562 cells were resuspended in Nucleofec - tor Solution V ( Lonza ) with 1 (cid:2) g plasmid DNA , and elec - troporated in an Amaxa 2D Nucleofector using program T - 016 . In case of LBR editing , a clonal K562 line stably transformed with Cas9 was used . Human retinal pigment epithelial ( RPE ) cells were cul - tured in a 1 : 1 mixture of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( Gibco ) with Nutrient F12 ( Gibco ) supplemented with 10 % FBS ( HyClone ) , 1 % penicillin / streptomycin . CRISPR vectors were transfected with 5 (cid:2) l Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent ( Invitrogen ) and 2 . 5 (cid:2) g plasmid DNA in 250 (cid:2) l antibiotic - free medium ( Gibco ) . Kc167 cells were cultured in Shields and Sang M3 Insect Medium ( Sigma - Aldrich ) with 0 . 25 % Bacto Peptone ( BD ) , 0 . 1 % Yeast Extract ( BD ) , 5 % heat - inactivated FBS and 1 % penicillin / streptomycin . Note that 1 × 10 6 cells were elec - troporated with 1 (cid:2) g each of Cas9 and sgRNA expression plasmid using a BioRad Gene Pulser II ( 450 (cid:2) F , 86 V ) . Constructs For human cells , expression vector PX330 ( Addgene plas - mid 42230 ) encoding Cas9 and chimeric guide RNA was used ( 11 ) . The LBR guides were cloned into expression vector pBluescript with the sgRNA cassette of PX330 and transfected into the K562 line stably transformed with Cas9 . For Drosophila cells , Cas9 expression vector pBS - Hsp70 - Cas9 ( Addgene plasmid 46294 ) was used in combination with pU6 - BbsI - chiRNA construct ( Addgene plasmid 45946 ) ( 12 ) . The sgRNAs were designed using CRISPR design ( http : / / crispr . mit . edu / ) ( 13 ) and CHOP - CHOP ( https : / / chopchop . rc . fas . harvard . edu / ) ( 14 ) .

PCR Genomic DNA ( ∼ 1 × 10 6 cells ) was isolated 3 days after transfection using the ISOLATE II Genomic DNA Kit of Bioline . PCR reactions were carried out with 50 ng genomic DNA in MyTaq Red mix ( Bioline ) according to manufac - ture instructions .

PCR pro - gram : 1 min at 96 ◦ C ( 1 × ) , followed by 30 s at 96 ◦ C , 15 s at 50 ◦ C and 4 min at 60 ◦ C ( 30 × ) , and finishing with 1 min in - cubation at 4 ◦ C ( 1 × ) . Samples were analyzed by an Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA Analyzer . Flow cytometry K562 - GFP cells were collected 8 days after nucleofection and directly analyzed for fluorescence using a BD FAC - SCalibur . Viable cells were gated on size and shape using forward and side scatter . The GFP expression was measured using a 488 nm laser for excitation . TIDE software TIDE code was written in R , version 3 . 1 . 1 . TIDE requires as input a control sequence data file ( e . g . obtained from cells transfected without RGEN Cas9 ) , a sample sequence data file ( e . g . DNA from a pool of cell treated with RGEN Cas9 ) and a character string representing the sgRNA sequence ( 20 nt ) . The sequencing data files ( . abif or . scf format ) are im - ported into TIDE using the R Bioconductor ( 15 ) package sangerseqR ( version 1 . 0 . 0 ) . Additional parameters have de - fault settings but can be adjusted if necessary . The web inter - face was constructed using the shiny R package , with some code adapted from the Poly Peak Parser web tool ( http : / / spark . rstudio . com / yostlab / PolyPeakParser / ) . The latter is a genotyping tool that can identify heterozygous short in - dels in sequence traces , but it cannot resolve sequences with complex indel mixtures ( 16 ) . TIDE first aligns the sgRNA sequence to the control sequence to determine the position of the expected Cas9 break site . Next , the control sequence region upstream of the break site is aligned to the experimental sample se - quence in order to determine any offset between the two se - quence reads . Alignments are done using standard Smith – Waterman local alignment implemented in the BioStrings package in Bioconductor . From here on , the software uses the peak heights for each base , as determined by the se - quence analysis software provided by the manufacturer of the capillary sequencing equipment ( we used 3730 Se - ries Data Collection Software V4 and Sequencing Analy - sis Software V6 ) . TIDE uses these peak heights to deter - mine the relative abundance of aberrant nucleotides over the length of the whole sequence trace .

This means that the average maximum aberrant sequence signal of 75 % actually represents 100 % of aberrant sequence trace . The plot of this aberrant sequence signal allows the user to gauge the quality of the sequence data , verify the expected cut site and interactively select the region used for decom - position . The decomposition is conducted on a sequence segment downstream of the break site . By default it spans from s + 5 basepairs ( bp ) downstream of the break to s + 5 bp from the end of the shortest sequence read , with s being the maxi - mum indel size in bp . Sequence trace models of all possi - ble deletions and insertions of sizes { 0 . n } ( n is by default set to 10 ) are constructed from the control sample trace by shifting all peaks by the appropriate number of posi - tions to the left or right , respectively . This is done for each of the four bases , after which the vectors of the four bases are concatenated so that the decomposition is done for all bases combined . Next , the sequence trace from the mutated DNA sample is assumed to be a linear combination of the wild - type and the modeled indel traces . This combination is then resolved by standard non - negative linear modeling , for which we used the R package nnls . R 2 is calculated to assess the goodness of fit . The P - value associated with the estimated abundance of each indel is calculated by a two - tailed t - test of the variance – covariance matrix of the stan - dard errors . In order to account for systematic differences between the sequence trace intensities of the control and mutated DNA , the fitting parameters are then multiplied by a constant factor such that their sum equals R 2 . Finally , to model insertions , the TIDE software esti - mates the relative frequency with which each of the four nu - cleotides is introduced immediately after the break site . This is done by removal of the aggregate of estimated signals of mutants that have smaller number of insertions ( including non - mutated and deletions ) . While this can be done for all insert sizes , TIDE currently only estimates the nucleotide composition of + 1 insertions , which are the most frequently observed insertions . RESULTS The TIDE method In the first step of TIDE , a stretch of about 500 – 1500 bp around the editing site is PCR amplified from genomic DNA isolated from the cell pool that was treated with the targeted nuclease . A parallel PCR amplifies the same stretch of DNA from a control cell pool lacking the nuclease or sgRNA . Both PCR products are then directly subjected to conventional capillary ( ‘Sanger’ ) sequencing , a basic tech - nology that is available in most laboratories . In the DNA sample from the cells expressing the targeted nuclease , the sequence trace after the break site consists of a mixture of signals derived from unmodified DNA and sequences that are each shifted by a different number of nucleotides due to insertions and deletions ( Figure 1a ) . Based on the quantitative sequence trace data , the TIDE software first visualizes the proportion of aberrant base sig - nals along the sequence traces in an intuitive graph ( Figure 1b , step 1 ) . This enables the user to visually inspect the se - quence deviation caused by the targeted nuclease , and verify that the break site is located as expected . Subsequently , the TIDE software decomposes the com - posite sequence trace into its individual components by means of multivariate non - negative linear modeling , with the control sequence trace serving as a template to model the individual indel components . This decomposition re - sults in an estimate of the relative abundance of every possi - ble indel within a chosen size range ( Figure 1b , step 2 ) . The software provides the R 2 value as a goodness - of - fit measure , and calculates the statistical significance for each indel . In the TIDE webtool , the sequence segment used for decom - position can be interactively adjusted , which is helpful in case the sequence traces are locally of poor quality . Finally , for insertions of a single basepair , the relative frequency of the four possible bases is deduced from the model , which is of interest if one wishes to obtain a + 1 mutation of a particular sequence ( Figure 1b , step 3 ) . For longer insertions this base - calling is computationally more complicated and currently not implemented . In vitro proof of principle In order to test our approach , we first constructed a se - ries of artificial samples consisting of wild - type DNA mixed with DNA carrying various indels in a broad range of rela - tive concentrations . We then performed standard capillary sequencing and fed the resulting data into the TIDE al - gorithm . The constituents of the mixes could be identified and quantified with great accuracy . In a mixture of wild - type and + 1 insertion DNA our algorithm was able to de - tect the insertion quantitatively with a sensitivity down to ∼ 2 . 5 % ( Figure 2a ; Supplementary Figure S1 ) , and gener - ally predicted the correct base ( Figure 2a , inset ; Supplemen - tary Figure S1 ) . Even a − 15 deletion could be reliably de - tected when mixed 1 : 10 with wild - type DNA ( Figure 2b ; Supplementary Figure S2a ) . All constituents in mixtures of wild - type DNA with either five or eight different indels were identified by TIDE ( Figure 2b ; Supplementary Figure S2b and c ) . These in vitro simulations show that sequence trace decomposition can accurately identify and quantify the constituent indels in a mixture . Application of TIDE to CRISPR / Cas9 edited DNA se - quences We then tested this approach on a pool of human K562 cells carrying random integrations of the GFP reporter gene . We transfected these cells with the RGEN Cas9 together with a sgRNA designed to target the GFP gene , or without the sgRNA as a control . TIDE determined that 34 . 2 % of GFP sequences in the sgRNA - treated cell pool carried an indel , with 23 . 2 % being a − 1 deletion ( Figure 3a ) . The composite sequence started at the expected break site ( Figure 3b ) , con - firming correct targeting by the sgRNA . The + 1 insertions consisted almost exclusively of a G nucleotide on the for - ward strand ( Figure 3a , inset ) , indicating that the choice of the inserted nucleotide is non - random . Sequencing of the opposite DNA strand yielded virtually identical quantita - D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p s : / / a c ade m i c . oup . c o m / na r / a r t i c l e - ab s t r a c t / 42 / 22 / e168 / 2411890 b y gue s t on 28 A p r il 2019 4 Nucleic Acids Research , 2014 b a % o f s equen c e 0 10 20 30 40 −10 −5 0 5 10 deletion insertion step 2 step 3 G C AT m i x ed poo l w t 200 300 400 500 0 20 40 60 80 100 basepair decomposition window expected cut % abe r an t s equen c e step 1 step 2 : decomposition - indel spectrum and frequencies step 3 : prediction + 1 nucleotide - base composition of + 1 insertion step 1 : user quality control visualize deviating signal : - break site at expected location ? - decomposition window covers representative sequence ?

Assessment of genome editing by sequence trace decomposition . ( a ) Due to imperfect repair after cutting by a targeted nuclease , the DNA in the cell pool consists of a mixture of indels , which yields a composite sequence trace after the break site .

To independently validate these results , we cloned and se - quenced 84 individual DNA molecules from the same PCR product . This revealed a similar spectrum of indels , in which the frequency of each indel is generally not significantly dif - ferent from the TIDE calculations ( Figure 3c ) . However , some larger indels with frequencies below ∼ 2 % were not significantly detected by TIDE . All + 1 insertions of the in - dividual clones consisted of a G nucleotide in the forward strand , confirming the computational inference . All the significant mutations found by TIDE are pre - dicted to lead to frame shifts yielding a non - functional truncated GFP protein .

See also Supplementary Figure S2a – c . sgRNA compared to the pool lacking the sgRNA ( Figure 3d ) . Thus , the calculation of gene editing efficiency by se - quence trace decomposition is in close agreement with the observed frequency of the phenotype . Finally , we used our approach to test different sgR - NAs designed to target endogenous genes in human or Drosophila cell lines ( Figure 3e – h ) . Interestingly , the results show that different sgRNAs resulted in distinct indel spec - tra . For example , a sgRNA targeting the NDC1 gene pro - duces roughly equal amounts of + 1 and − 1 indels , while a sgRNA targeting the LBR gene produces mainly + 1 in - sertions and a few bigger deletions including a more pro - nounced − 7 deletion . Overall , small indels ( + 1 and − 1 ) ap - pear to be the most common mutations induced by Cas9 , which is in agreement with other studies ( 3 – 5 ) . Individual indels were detected at estimated frequencies down to ∼ 1 % . Again , the results were nearly identical when the opposite strand was sequenced ( Supplementary Figure S3b and c ) . In addition , + 1 insertions were typically dominated by one specific nucleotide , which was identical to one of the two ter - minal nucleotides of the break site . Which of the two neigh - boring nucleotides is duplicated appears to vary . For exam - ple , one sgRNA guide targeting NDC1 resulted in differ - ent + 1 insertions in K562 and RPE cells ( Figure 3e and f ) . How the DSB repair machinery chooses the inserted bases remains to be elucidated . DISCUSSION Advantages of TIDE Genome editing techniques like CRISPR , TALENs and ZFPs are now widely used to alter specific sequences in genomes of cultured cells . However , the efficacy and the spectrum of mutations vary greatly depending on the RGEN target site and cells used ( ( 17 , 18 ) and this report ) . Hence , a fast and cost - effective approach to determine the efficacy of RGENs is essential to optimize the genome edit - ing strategies . TIDE takes advantage of the fact that non - homologous end - joining repair of DNA DSBs leaves an in - del at the break site . By decomposition of the quantitative sequence trace data , the TIDE software identifies and quan - tifies these indels . This allows researchers to quickly deter - mine the efficiency of the RGENs and rationally estimate the number of cell clones that must be picked and screened in order to obtain a clonal line with a particular indel of interest . Attractive features of TIDE are the low costs and the fact that it requires only two standard PCRs and two capillary sequencing runs . Hands - on time is therefore limited , and re - sults can be obtained in 1 or 2 days . We found that TIDE is capable of detecting insertions and deletions with a sen - sitivity up to ∼ 1 – 2 % across various target regions in a pool of cells . The method is highly robust , as indicated by the strong correspondence between the decomposition results from forward and reverse sequence traces . Good agreement of TIDE results with the sequence composition of a set of individually cloned DNA molecules underscores the relia - bility . Comparison to other methods Several other methods have been used to assess genome editing efficacies . Cloning and sequencing of 50 – 100 indi - vidual DNA molecules provides an accurate characteriza - tion of the indel spectrum , but this is obviously more labor - intensive and 25 – 50 times more expensive than TIDE . Next - generation sequencing ( NGS ) of bulk PCR products , fol - lowed by analysis using software , such as CRISPR - GA ( 9 ) , provides a highly detailed estimate of the indel spectrum , but this method is only cost - effective if a large number of samples are multiplexed ; moreover , in most research insti - tutes NGS takes several weeks .

( a – d ) A pool of human K562 cells expressing GFP treated with Cas9 alone ( control ) and cells treated with Cas9 and a GFP targeting sgRNA ( sample ) were analyzed by : TIDE ( a and b ) , sequence analysis of 84 cloned DNA fragments ( c ) and flow cytometry ( d ) . ( a ) Indel spectrum determined by TIDE . Inset shows the estimated composition of the inserted base for the + 1 insertion . ( b ) Aberrant nucleotide signal of the sample ( green ) compared to that of the control ( black ) . Blue dotted line indicates the expected cutting site . Gray horizontal bar shows the region used for decomposition . ( c ) Comparison of indel occurrences in cloned DNA fragments ( n = 84 ) to frequencies estimated by TIDE , with P - values according to Pearson’s chi - squared test . Decomposition was limited to indels of size 0 - 10 , hence larger indels could not be detected . ( d ) Distributions of GFP fluorescence intensities of Cas9 and Cas9 + sgRNA treated cells , measured by flow cytometry . The percentage of GFP - positive cells is indicated in the top right corner within indicated histogram gate . ( e – h ) TIDE analysis of various endogenous genes ( NDC1 , LBR , LMN ) targeted with RGENs in human cell lines ( K562 , RPE ) and in a Drosophila cell line ( Kc167 ) . Insets : prediction of the inserted base for + 1 insertions .

This approach is time - consuming and still requires moder - ately effective DSB induction and hence prior characteriza - tion of the efficacy of the genome editing tool is desirable . Finally , assays that employ mismatch - detecting enzymes ( 7 , 8 ) require a similar amount of hands - on time as TIDE , but only estimate the overall mutation frequency and do not characterize the spectrum of indels . Moreover , poly - morphisms in the vicinity of the break site are expected to cause high background signals in these enzymatic assays , unlike TIDE . Thus , TIDE offers a cost - effective and accu - rate alternative strategy for the rapid testing of genome edit - ing efficacy . Potential limitations of TIDE Naturally , the reliability of TIDE depends on the purity of the PCR products and the quality of the sequence reads . Decomposition results with a low R 2 must be interpreted with caution . As a rule of thumb , we recommend to aim for a background signal of aberrant sequences before the break site < 10 % ( both control and test sample ) , and R 2 > 0 . 9 for the decomposition result . Sequencing of the opposite strand is recommended to confirm the results . Highly repet - itive sequences around the target site may in some instances hamper the decomposition . Incorrect alignments can be de - tected when the quality plot shows an aberrant sequence sig - nal that is not located at the expected break site . The decom - position window can be adjusted in order to avoid repetitive regions . Additional applications While we demonstrated the utility here for Cas9 - based mu - tagenesis , TIDE should also be applicable to other genome editing tools that are based on targeted DSB induction ( 1 , 2 ) . Because of the quantitative nature of the results , TIDE may also be used to study mechanisms of DSB re - pair . For example , we observed that the spectrum of inser - tions and deletions varies among various target sites and cell types . It will be interesting to employ TIDE to investi - gate how DSB repair is affected by sequence context or lo - cal chromatin environment . Another application would be to determine differential effects of various indels at a gene of interest on cellular fitness . With TIDE , the relative abun - dance of indels can be followed over time in a growing popu - lation of cells treated with RGENs . An increase or decrease of wild - type sequence or particular indel over time could be an indication that the targeted sequence is lethal . In sum - mary , TIDE will be a valuable tool for a broad diversity of research involving genome editing methods . SUPPLEMENTARY DATA Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online .
