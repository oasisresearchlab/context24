The persistence length of actin filaments is 9 . 8 µm , corresponding to a flexural rigidity of 0 . 040 pN µm 2 . Cofilin binding lowers the persistence length ∼ 5 - fold to a value of 2 . 2 µm and the filament flexural rigidity to 0 . 0091 pN µm 2 . That cofilin - decorated filaments are more flexible than native filaments despite an increased mass indicates that cofilin binding weakens and redistributes stabilizing subunit interactions of filaments . We favor a mechanism in which the increased flexibility of cofilin - decorated filaments results from the linked dissociation of filament - stabilizing ions and reorganization of actin subdomain 2 and as a consequence promotes severing due to a mechanical asymmetry . Knowledge of the effects of cofilin on actin filament bending mechanics , together with our previous analysis of torsional stiffness , provide a quantitative measure of the mechanical changes in actin filaments associated with cofilin binding , and suggest that the overall mechanical and force - producing properties of cells can be modulated by cofilin activity .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t severing of microtubules by katanin , the energy of cofilin binding alone modulates the mechanical properties of actin filaments so that they destabilize and fragment . Knowledge of the cofilin - linked changes in actin filament mechanics and structure is essential for formulating predictive models of cofilin - mediated actin filament severing . Structural and biochemical analysis demonstrates that cofilin alters the filament subunit tilt 7 and increases the filament helical twist , 8 increases the disorder of actin subdomain 2 9 and the DNase - binding loop , 10 disrupts the subdomain 1 to 2 interface of adjacent subunits along the long pitch helix , 11 and weakens stabilizing lateral contacts . 12 , 13 Cofilin binding lowers the actin filament torsional stiffness , so cofilin - decorated filaments twist more easily than native filaments . 14 The surface tethering - dependence of severing efficiency suggests that filament flexibility plays a critical role in severing by cofilin , 6 and implies that changes in the flexibility contribute to cofilin - mediated destabilization and severing . However , the extent , if any , to which filament bending mechanics are affected by cofilin has not been evaluated directly . In this study , we measured the effect of cofilin on the bending mechanics of actin filaments from analysis of their thermal fluctuations in shape . Our results indicate that a cofilin - decorated actin filament is ∼ 5 - fold more flexible than a bare , native actin filament . These results , together with our previous measurements of torsional stiffness , 14 provide a complete description of the changes in actin filament mechanics associated with cofilin binding and severing , and provide novel insight into the molecular basis of the reported changes in mechanical properties at the leading edge of migrating cells . Results We used fluorescence microscopy to visualize Alexa 488 - labeled native and cofilin - decorated actin filaments undergoing thermal fluctuations ( Fig . 1 ; Supplementary Data Video 1 and Supplementary Data Video 3 ) . Filament motions were constrained to two dimensions by minimizing the depth of the solution . Uncertainties introduced from out of plane ( i . e . three - dimensional ) thermal fluctuations are accounted for in the analysis . Stochastic simulations ( discussed below ) confirm constraint to two dimensions under the experimental conditions . Both native and cofilin - decorated filaments behave like semi - flexible polymers in solution and undergo thermally driven random fluctuations in shape ( Fig . 1 and Fig . 2 ; Supplementary Data Video 1 – Supplementary Data Video 4 ) . Cofilactin filaments ( Supplementary Data Video 3 ) , however , fluctuate more rapidly than undecorated , native filaments ( Supplementary Data Video 1 ) and display a weaker tangent angular correlation up to filament lengths of ∼ 4 µm under identical conditions ( Fig . 3 ) . Alexa - labeling does not affect actin polymerization kinetics or energetics at the labeling ratios used in this study , 15 , 16 and is unlikely to affect subunit interactions and filament mechanics significantly . Therefore , the mechanical properties measured with Alexa - labeled actin filaments are expected to reliably reflect those of native , unlabeled actin filaments . The persistence length ( L p ) is defined as the characteristic arc length ( i . e . contour length of a segment ) over which correlation between the corresponding tangent angles ( θ ( s ) ) of a fluctuating semi - flexible polymer , such as an actin filament , are lost in three - dimensional space . 17 , 18 The average cosine correlation function ( 〈 C ( s ) 〉 ) defines the L p - dependence of tangent angle ( θ ) correlation of any segment ( arc ) length ( s ) along the contour length ( L ) of a filament constrained to two - dimensional motion within a plane according to 19 : ( 1 ) McCullough et al .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t The motions of a rigid rod are correlated ( i . e . 〈 C ( s ) 〉 → 1 ) , while those of a flexible rod with a length ( L ≥ s in Eq . ( 1 ) ) that is much longer than its persistence length ( s ≫ L p ) are uncorrelated ( i . e . 〈 C ( s ) 〉 → 0 ) . The denominator of the exponential term of Eq . ( 1 ) is replaced with L p when the polymer is free to fluctuate in three dimensions , 17 thereby lowering the angular correlation . The two - dimensional cosine correlation function ( Eq . ( 1 ) ) was used ( Fig . 3 ) to calculate the actin and cofilactin filament L p values from digitized filament images ( see Materials and Methods ) . To measure accurately the extent to which cofilin modulates L p , a continuum mechanical property , we observed actin filaments that were either fully bare or fully decorated with cofilin . Segment lengths ( s ) with points of origin along the entire length of the filament were used to determine the persistence length values . This procedure minimizes uncertainty from nucleotide - dependent filament “end effects” ( i . e . cofilin does not bind the small ATP cap at filament ends ) . 3 Cofilin lowers the persistence length of actin filaments ∼ 5 - fold ( Table 1 ) . The persistence length of native actin filaments ( without phalloidin ) under our experimental conditions is 9 . 8 ±0 . 1 µm ( Table1 ) ; comparable to a previously reported value of 9 . 0±0 . 5 µm measured under slightly different buffer conditions , 19 and the value predicted from molecular dynamics simulations . 20 – 22 Cofilactin filaments have an L p of 2 . 2±0 . 03 µm ( Table 1 ) ; comparable to those of intermediate filaments ( L p is 0 . 3 – 3 µm for neurofilaments 23 and vimentin 24 , 25 ) . Stochastic simulations of actin and cofilactin filament equilibrium configurations ( Fig . 4 ; Supplementary Data Video 5 and Supplementary Data Video 6 ) confined to two - dimensional fluctuations account for the experimental data ( Fig . 3 ) . The agreement between the observed ( Fig . 3 ) and simulated ( Fig . 4 ) angular correlations confirms that the two - dimensional fluctuation approximation used in the analysis is fulfilled under our experimental conditions . Quantitative knowledge of the two - dimensional angular correlation allows us to predict the equilibrium configurations of filaments in three dimensions ( Fig . 4 ; Supplementary Data Video 5 and Supplementary Data Video 6 ) . As expected , there is less angular correlation when filaments are free to fluctuate in three dimensions . However , it should be noted that the net effect of cofilin on short filaments ( < 2 µm ) is more pronounced in three dimensions than when constrained to two dimensions . In addition , note that the correlation ( i . e . stiffness ) of both filament types is high at lengths < 0 . 7 µm ( ∼ 250 subunits ) , which may contribute to the inability of cofilin to destabilize or sever filaments of this length . 2 The three - dimensional filament flexural rigidity ( κ ) calculated from the experimental L p values , Boltzmann’s constant ( k B ) , and the absolute temperature ( T ) using Eq . ( 2 ) : ( 2 ) is 0 . 040 pN µm 2 for actin filaments and 0 . 0091 pN µm 2 for cofilactin filaments ( Table 1 ) , indicating that cofilin binding increases the bending flexibility of actin filaments ∼ 5 - fold . The lowest compressive force ( i . e . external load , F c ) needed to buckle a filament depends on κ according to : 26 ( 3 ) Therefore , a cofilactin filament will buckle under a compressive force ∼ 5 - fold smaller than that needed to buckle an actin filament of identical length because of the reduction in κ .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t The flexural rigidity ( κ ) of a semi - flexible polymer can be related to its elastic ( Young’s ) modulus ( E ) and geometric moment of inertia ( I ) when modeled as a homogenous isotropic material by : ( 4 ) E is the shape - independent measure of material stiffness and I is the shape - dependent , geometric moment of inertia ( second moment of area ) , which is a function of the cross - sectional area and radius of gyration ( R g ) . 27 For a helical polymer that deviates from radial symmetry and possesses roughly an elliptical cross - sectional area , 28 , 29 I corresponds to the geometric mean of the two principle axes 18 as defined by : ( 5 ) where r a and r b are the major and minor radii , respectively . There is uncertainty in estimating the Young’s elastic modulus of actin and cofilactin filaments from their flexural rigidities ( κ ) , since they are not isotropic structures . 29 Evaluating the contributions of elasticity ( E ) and geometry ( I ) to the change in rigidity ( κ ) of an anisotropic material is complex and requires a detailed geometric model of bending . Without detailed knowledge about the geometries involved at the filament subunit level , we consider a filament to behave as a homogenous material so that the apparent E can be expressed as a simple scalar ( Eq . ( 5 ) ) . Although there are limitations in applying such a simplified model , it provides insight and describes well the overall mechanical behavior of actin filaments , 18 , 30 actin filaments saturated with tropomyosin , 26 large - scale actin networks , 31 and microtubules . 18 In addition , the bending fluctuations analyzed in this study are on length - scales much greater than the filament helical repeat , so anisotropies arising from local , non - cylindrical fluctuations in shape will be averaged . 18 , 32 We , therefore , consider filaments at lengths and time - scales applicable to the bending fluctuations analyzed in this study to behave as homogeneous , isotropic material . 30 An actin filament modeled as a homogenous isotropic elliptical cylinder 18 with a major radius of 4 . 5 nm 28 and mean radius of 3 . 5 nm 29 has a second moment of inertia ( I ) of 120 nm 4 calculated using Eq . ( 6 ) ( Fig . 6 ) . Cofilin binding increases the filament radius ∼ 20 – 30 % , 8 and the major radius to 6 . 7 nm ( Fig . 5 ) . 14 Since cofilin increases the mass of the filament ∼ 40 % without increasing the filament length per subunit ( rise ) , the geometric mean radius is ∼ 4 . 2 nm ( ∼ 20 % increase ) , which corresponds to a value of 240 nm 4 for I . The experimental flexural rigidity ( κ ) values ( Table 1 ) and Eq . ( 5 ) yield Young’s elastic moduli ( E ) of 330 pN nm − 2 for native and 38 pN nm − 2 for cofilin - decorated actin filaments . Changes in the radial mass distribution within the filament could affect the geometric moment ( I ) and thereby lower the bending rigidity ( κ , Eq . ( 4 ) ) of cofilin - decorated filaments . Actin subdomain 2 makes the highest radius contact in the filament , 33 and disorder of this region significantly affects the filament flexibility . 14 , 20 – 22 , 33 Cofilin binding leads to the reorganization of subdomain 2 , 9 – 11 and disrupts ( longitudinal and lateral ) filament subunit contacts . 11 – 13 , 34 , 35 It is , therefore , likely that the overall reduction in filament stiffness associated with cofilin binding arises from changes in the filament elasticity ( E ) and geometry ( I ) achieved by modulating the strength and redistribution of the intra - and intersubunit bonds .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Discussion Cofilin makes actin filaments more elastic , in marked contrast to the stiffening effects of other filament binding proteins , such as tropomyosin . 19 The stiffness of a tropomyosin - decorated actin filament can be accounted for 26 by the increase in filament mass ( I ) ; there is little or no effect on the filament Young ' s elastic modulus ( E ) . Cofilin binding also increases the filament mass ( ∼ 40 % ) and second moment of inertia ( Table 1 ) , but differs from tropomyosin in that it dramatically lowers the Young’s filament elastic modulus ( Table 1 ) . The reduction in the apparent elastic modulus is sufficiently large ( ∼ 10 - fold ) that decorated filaments bend more readily and rapidly ( Fig . 1 ; Supplementary Data Video 1 – Supplementary Data Video 4 ) and to a greater extent ( Fig . 2 ) than bare filaments , even though they have a greater mass and second moment of inertia . The elasticity of non - covalent protein polymers such as actin filaments is determined by the strength of the intra - and intersubunit bonds . 26 The modulation of filament bending ( Fig . 4 ) and twisting 14 mechanics ( Table 1 ) indicates that cofilin binding disrupts stabilizing contacts between filament subunits and / or enhances their conformational dynamics , both of which have been documented extensively for the cofilin - actin filament interaction . 9 – 14 , 35 We favor a mechanism in which the cofilin - linked changes in filament bending and twisting mechanics ( Table 1 ) are mediated largely through the reorganization of actin subdomain 2 , since the conformation of this region influences the subunit longitudinal contacts and filament flexibility , 33 and is modulated by cofilin binding . 9 – 11 Molecular dynamics simulations 22 indicate that filament lateral contacts are also dependent on the actin subdomain 2 conformation . Therefore , the weakening of longitudinal and lateral filament contacts with cofilin binding 10 – 14 could be mediated through interaction with actin subdomain 2 . Cofilin binding to actin is coupled to the dissociation of actin filament - associated ions . 36 Ions have long been known to stabilize the polymer form of actin through polysteric linkage ( i . e . salt polymerizes actin monomers ) . It is likely that linked ion dissociation contributes to changes in filament mechanics . Consistent with this interpretation , filaments in low - salt conditions are more flexible than those in high salt ( i . e . ion binding makes filaments stiff 33 ) . In addition , hydroxyl radical footprinting reveal that lowering the ionic strength compromises interactions between filament subunits , which increases the conformational flexibility of filaments . 37 It is likely that other regulatory actin - binding proteins also dissociate ions from actin without destabilizing filaments . This behavior would arise if the stabilizing ion – actin interactions were replaced with stabilizing protein – actin interactions ( e . g . interactions that bridge filament subunits ) . In the case of cofilin , the stabilizing ion – actin interactions are replaced with net interactions that are non - or de - stabilizing 36 . It has been suggested that an asymmetry in filament mechanics , rather than cumulative changes in filament mechanics , generates filament severing 4 since fully decorated and bare actin filaments are more stable than filaments partially decorated with cofilin . 38 Because boundaries between cofilin - bound and unbound actin subunits occur with a higher frequency at low binding densities than at high binding densities , local changes ( i . e . boundaries ) in the mechanical properties will be more prominent at binding densities where cofilin binds non - contiguously . 4 The observation that actin filament severing occurs at low cofilin cluster sizes and binding 4 – 6 but is inhibited at high cofilin - binding densities 5 , 6 supports this hypothesis and favors a mechanism 4 in which local changes in filament bending and twisting dynamics introduces an asymmetry in filament mechanics that promotes severing . This behavior arises because stress localizes in regions where changes in the mechanical properties exist , which increases the likelihood of fatigue fractures from thermal fluctuations at these boundaries . 39 McCullough et al .

This gradient will modulate the overall stiffness and elasticity of the actin cytoskeleton , such that cofilin activation could contribute to motility by facilitating ( lamellipodial ) actin bending 40 in addition to severing . 3 Bending flexibility may propagate cooperatively along the filament to subunits without bound cofilin , as do changes in torsional flexibility . 14 Overall softening of the actin network could potentially reduce the net force production or protrusion efficiency of these cellular actin - based structures . 43 Materials and Methods Protein and sample preparation Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was purified , 44 labeled with tenfold molar excess Alexa 488 Fluor succinimidyl ester ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR : cat . # A2000 ) and gel - filtered over Sephacryl S300 at 4 °C in G buffer ( 5 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 1 mM NaN 3 ) as described . 16 Actin concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 290 nm , 44 and corrected for Alexa 488 labeling . 16 The labeling efficiency was ∼ 0 . 8 Alexa 488 fluorophores per actin monomer . Ca 2 + - actin monomers were converted to Mg 2 + - actin monomers with 0 . 2 mM EGTA and 50 µM MgCl 2 then polymerized with 0 . 1 vol . 10× polymerization buffer yielding KMI 66 buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 20 mM imidazole , pH 6 . 6 ) . Recombinant human non - muscle cofilin - 1 was purified as described . 4 , 14 , 36 Cofilin - decorated actin filaments ( 2 – 10 µM ) were made by adding cofilin at a concentration ≥ 10 times the value needed to reach half maximum saturation of actin . 4 Equilibrated samples were rapidly diluted five - to ten - fold into KMI 6 . 6 buffer supplemented with 30 µg mL − 1 glucose , 100 µg mL − 1 catalase and 10 mM glucose directly on a 70 % ethanol - cleaned glass microscope slide . Cofilactin filaments were diluted into buffer with free cofilin at a concentration to ensure the cofilin binding density remained constant and near unity ( one cofilin per actin subunit ) . After dilution , a 6 µL final sample volume was covered with a 22 mm × 22 mm glass coverslip , excess solution was removed and the coverslip was sealed with vacuum grease . The depth of the solution was estimated to be < 3 µm by measuring the difference in focus from the two internal glass surfaces . 19 A chamber depth of < 3 µm was necessary to prevent the actin filament from rotating axially . Motions out of the focal plane may underestimate the length , 18 but this error ( ∼ 0 . 2 % of filament length ) from a nonzero depth is smaller than the interval used to calculate 〈 C ( s ) 〉 ( ∼ 5 % ) for the minimum length of the filament analyzed and has been confirmed to be adequate through our simulations . Image processing and analysis Images of single filaments undergoing thermal fluctuations were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope equipped with a Coolsnap HQ cooled CCD camera ( Roper Scientific , Tucson , AZ ) and Metamorph image acquisition software ( Molecular Devices , Downington , PA ) . Digital images were acquired consecutively for 50 frames with exposure times of 50 ms for native actin filaments and 20 ms for cofilactin filaments , rendering the latter to appear dimmer . Digital image stacks were processed using Metamorph software . Individual filaments were cropped to reduce overall background shift and processed with a low - pass 3×3 averaging filter , thresholded for light objects , three - neighbor dilated , all point eroded and autoskeletonized to extract the shape of the filament . This procedure removes artifacts arising from low signal to noise and autoskeletonization without compromising the pixels comprising the filament backbone . McCullough et al . Page 6 J Mol Biol .

The density of guide points used to reconstruct the filament shape was chosen as the minimum that did not change the derived value of the persistence length , L p . 19 Representations were visually inspected by overlaying the backbone reconstructions above the raw images . Two separate data pools were analyzed independently to validate reproducibility . The actin and cofilactin filament L p values were calculated from 300 digitized filament images ( n ≥ 10 filaments for each data set ) . Stochastic simulations Model - based simulations of equilibrium configurations of filaments undergoing two - and three - dimensional fluctuations in shape were based on the force balance equation : ( 7 ) where boldface variables code for vectors , C d is the drag coefficient per unit length in a direction parallel with the filament long axis ; a is the unit vector tangent to the filament long axis at position s at time t ; r ( s , t ) is a point defining position s along a filament at time t ; s is the segment ( arc ) length ( s ) along the contour length ( L ) of a filament ; κ is flexural rigidity ; f is a force vector used to mimic the presence of walls or to implement inextensibility constraint via tension Λ ; ξ is a random force term . The scalar and vector products in the left - hand side of Eq . ( 7 ) implement the drag force , which is proportional to the point velocity vector . However , because it is easier to move in the direction parallel with the local tangent direction ( given by vector a ) rather than in the orthogonal direction , the velocity parallel with a ( given by the term and orthogonal to a ( given by the term ) must be considered . The drag coefficient for slender bodies ( e . g . an individual filament ) moving near a wall ( fulfilled under our conditions ) is given by : 45 ( 8 ) where η is the solvent viscosity ( 0 . 003 Pa·s ) ; H is the distance between the filament and the wall ( 1 . 5 µm ) ; R d is the filament radius ( actin , 3 . 5 nm ; cofilactin , 4 . 2 nm ) . Each component of the random force has the following properties : ( 9 ) We define new dimensionless variables : McCullough et al . Page 7 J Mol Biol .
