HS1 - associated pro - tein X - 1 ( HAX - 1 ) is an anti - apoptotic factor involved in the development of many types of cancer . However , its func - tional role in human PTC remains unclear . Here we investigated HAX - 1 overexpression in human PTC samples and correlated with tumor size and TNM stage . Decreased expression of HAX - 1 significantly inhibited proliferation , mi - gration , and invasion in papillary thyroid cancer cell lines TPC1 and K1 . Furthermore , we found that down - regulation of HAX - 1 induced cell apoptosis . Our results suggest that HAX - 1 plays a significant role in regulating the biological behavior in PTC cells and may contribute to PTC target therapy . Keywords : HAX - 1 , papillary thyroid carcinoma , apoptosis , migration , invasion Introduction PTC is the most common type of all thyroid cancers [ 1 ] . Despite most of the patients suf - fering from PTC having satisfactory long term prognosis with approximately 95 % 5 - year sur - vival rate , about 20 % of PTC patients exhibit distant metastasis or local recurrence [ 2 ] . Lymph node metastasis develops in the early stages of PTC and enhances the rate of mortal - ity and recurrence [ 3 , 4 ] . Mechanisms regard - ing tumorigenesis to therapeutic means remain unclear , indicating the need for more studies to identify novel treatments for PTC . HCLS1 - associated protein X - 1 ( HAX - 1 ) was first considered as a protein , which contributes to B cell signaling transformation by interplaying with HS - 1 ( hematopoietic lineage cell - specific protein - 1 ) [ 5 ] . HAX - 1 can exert its function by interacting with diverse structural proteins , in - dicating its contribution in intracellular signal - ing [ 5 - 7 ] . HAX - 1 is widely expressed in human and mouse tissues and has been suggested to be positioned in cell membranes and the endo - plasmic reticulum ( ER ) . HAX - 1 has a plurality of functions including cell migration , invasion , and adhesion . In addition , HAX - 1 participates in metastasis and tumorigenesis of a variety types of tumors [ 8 ] . Accumulating studies found that HAX - 1 is overexpressed in multiple solid carcinomas , such as lung , breast , and hepatocellular carcinoma [ 9 ] . These results indicate that the dysfunction of HAX - 1 contrib - utes to tumorigenesis . HAX - 1 is an effective anti - apoptotic protein of expression and is mainly observed in the mitochondria [ 9 , 10 ] . HAX - 1 has been found to bind with proteins regarding mitochondrial membrane permeabili - ty and the factors causing apoptosis [ 6 , 10 , 11 ] . Until now , there has been no research regard - ing the involvement of HAX - 1 in PTC . In the pres - ent study , we analyzed HAX - 1 expression in PTC tissues and the association between HAX - 1 and clinical pathological features of PTC . Moreover , the function of HAX - 1 in PTC and the potential pathogenesis contribution in PTC cell lines was also examined . HAX - 1 in papillary thyroid carcinoma 2081 Int J Clin Exp Pathol 2018 ; 11 ( 4 ) : 2080 - 2087 Materials and methods Tissue specimen acquisition This study was performed with the approval of the Ethics Committee of First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University , and informed con - sent was obtained from all the patients with PTC whose tissue specimens were used in this study . None of the patients included suffered from other concurrent malignancies or were anaplastic or had other poorly differentiated follicular carcinomas of the thyroid or under - went any treatment prior to surgery . Fresh - frozen tumor tissues ( n = 12 ) and adjacent normal tissues ( n = 12 ) were obtained from patients with PTC undergoing surgical resec - tion at the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University . Samples were stored at - 80°C for further experiments . Paraffin section specimens from the thyroid were obtained from 102 Chinese patients who had PTC . All patients had a clinical duration of less than 3 years and had been admitted to the hospital for standard thyroidectomies between 2011 and 2013 . Diagnoses were confirmed through histopathological examination . None of the patients had received radiotherapy or chemo - therapy before undergoing surgical . TNM stage was assessed according to the tumor , node , and metastasis system classification proposed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer ( 7th edition ) . Cell culture and transfection Human papillary thyroid cancer cell lines TPC - 1 and K1 were kind gifts from Dr Wei Sun . TPC - 1 was cultured Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM , Gibco , NY , USA ) and 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS , Hyclone , UT , USA ) . Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) : Ham’s F12 : MCDB105 ( 2 : 1 : 1 ) plus 2 mM glutamine and 10 % fetal bovine serum . All cells were cultured under 5 % CO 2 atmosphere 37°C . The medium was changed 2 days and sub - cultured when the cell popula - tion density reached to 70 - 80 % confluence . HAX - 1 - and HAX - 1 - RNAi - lentiviral vectors were purchased from Shanghai GeneChem Com - pany ( Shanghai , China ) . The HAX - 1 sequence was 5’ - AGCCCAAATCCTATTTCAA - 3’ and the shRNA control sequence was 5’ - TTCTCCGAA - CGTGTCACGTTT - 3’ . Western blot assay Tissues and cells were lysed in radioimmuno - precipitation ( RIPA ) buffer and total protein concentration was determined with a bicincho - ninic acid ( BCA ) assay ( Beyotime , China ) . Twenty micrograms of total protein were separated by 10 % SDS - PAGE and then transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride ( PVDF ) membranes . The membranes were washed , blocked , and incu - bated sequentially with specific primary anti - bodies , namely : rabbit polyclonal anti - HAX1 ( 1 : 1000 , Abcam , Cambridge , UK ) , rabbit mono - clonal anti - Cleaved - caspase 3 ( 1 : 1500 , Abcam , Cambridge , UK ) , rabbit monoclonal anti - cleav - ed - caspase 9 ( 1 : 1500 , Abcam , Cambridge , UK ) , rabbit monoclonal anti - BAX ( 1 : 1500 , Ab - cam , Cambridge , UK ) , anti - DR5 ( 1 : 500 , Abcam , Cambridge , UK ) mouse polyclonal anti - Tubulin ( 1 : 3000 , Santa Cruz , USA ) . Incubation in pri - mary antibodies was followed by goat anti - rab - bit secondary antibody or goat anti - mouse secondary antibody ( 1 : 5000 , Origene Co . , Ltd . Beijing , China ) . The reactions were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence assay . Each experiment was performed in triplicate . Cell viability assays The 3 - ( 4 , 5 - dimethylthiazol - 2 - yl ) - 2 , 5 - diphenylte - trazolium bromide ( MTT ) assay was used to determine the cell viability . thyroid cancer cell were seeded on 96 - well plates at 1 d , 2 d and 3 d after transfection , the samples were rinsed twice with sterile phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) and the adherent cells were incubated in medium containing 100 mg / 0 . 1 ml of MTT ( Sigma Aldrich ) for 4 h . After carefully removing the medium , the blue crystal layer attached to the surface of the material was then dissolved using dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) . The optical density ( OD ) was measured at 490 nm using a spectrophotometer . Cell migration assay and invasion assay Migration assays were performed using atran - swell chamber with an 8 - μm pore size for 24 - well plates ( Corning ) . Cells transfected with shHAX - 1 and shNC were seeded in the upper chamber at 2 - 5×10 5 in DMEM serum free mediumand DMEM with 10 % FBS was added in the bottom of the chamber . After 24 h , the cells on the upper surface of the filter were removed carefully by a cotton swab . Chambers HAX - 1 in papillary thyroid carcinoma 2082 Int J Clin Exp Pathol 2018 ; 11 ( 4 ) : 2080 - 2087 were fixed in 95 % ethanol 15 min stained with 0 . 1 % crystal violet . Three fields per chamber were randomly selected and the average cells numbers were counted . Cell invasion assays were performed in plates were coated by Matrigel ( BD Bioscience , San Jose , CA , USA ) and with similar conditions for the migration assay . Results HAX - 1 is upregulated in PTC and correlated with clinical characteristics To evaluate the role of HAX - 1 in the progression of PTC , immunohistochemistry was used to test in 102 PTC specimens and their adjacent normal tissues ( Figure 1A ) . The association between HAX - 1 expression levels and patient clinical characters is shown in Table 1 . High expression of HAX - 1 was significantly associat - ed with tumor size ( P < 0 . 05 ) and tumor TNM stage ( P < 0 . 05 ) . No correlations were found with gender , patient age , or lymph node metas - tasis . These findings suggest that levels and activity of HAX1 correlate with the stage of PTC . Furthermore , Western blot assay was employed for analysis of HAX - 1 protein expression in 12 PTC tissues samples . As shown in Figure 1B , HAX - 1 in PTC tissues was higher than that in the matched adjacent normal tissues ( P < 0 . 01 ) . Knockdown of HAX1 in PTC cell lines inhibits cellular proliferation and colony formation In order to characterize the role of HAX - 1 in TPC1 and K1 cell proliferation , we first used a shRNA targeted to HAX1 ( shHAX - 1 ) markedly decreased the HAX - 1 level compared to the control sequence ( shNC ) in both TPC1 and K1 cells ( Figure 2A ) . Next , to assess cells proli - feration rate we used MTT assay . The result showed that the proliferation rate of shHAX - 1 group was significantly reduced than that of shNC group in both cell lines ( Figure 2B ) . Furthermore , clonogenic assays showed that Figure 1 . Expression of HAX1 in PTC tissue and adjacent non - cancerous tissue . A .

HAX - 1 in papillary thyroid carcinoma 2083 Int J Clin Exp Pathol 2018 ; 11 ( 4 ) : 2080 - 2087 HAX1 knockdown significantly inhibited cell colony formation ( Figure 2C ) . These findings suggest that silencing HAX - 1 could impair PTC cell growth . Knockdown of HAX1 inhibits PTC cell migration and invasion To explore whether knockdown of HAX - 1 could affect cell invasion and migration capacities , we performed transwell assay in both cell lines transfected with shHAX1 and shNC . The results showed that , compared to the shNC group , the migration and invasion cell number of TPC1 and K1 in shHAX1 group was dramatically down - regulated ( Figure 2D and 2E ) . Moreover , the results confirmed that down - regulation of HAX - 1 could reduce PTC cell migration and invasion ability . HAX - 1 knockdown induced PTC cells apoptosis To further study the effect of HAX - 1 inhibition on the apoptosis of PTC , cells transfected with shHAX - 1 and their control group cells were stained with Annexin V and PI . The flow cytom - etry results suggested that the apoptosis in - duced by shHAX - 1 was significantly increased in both TPC1 and K1 cell lines . In addition , the expression levels of cleaved caspase 3 and 9 were dramatically increased through suppres - sion of HAX - 1 expression in PTC cells ( Figure 3B ) . Moreover , we examined whether BAX and death receptor 5 ( DR5 ) were regulated by HAX - 1 silencing . The result showed that both BAX and DR5 were up - regulated in TPC and K1 cells . Discussion In the present study , our results shown that HAX - 1 expression is up - regulated and correlat - ed with clinical pathological features in PTC . Additionally , knockdown of HAX - 1 in two PTC cell lines ( K1 and TPC - 1 ) inhibited proliferation , migration and invasion . In addition , HAX - 1 also exhibited apoptosis in TPC - 1 and K1 cell lines since repression of HAX - 1 can caused cell apoptosis . PTC is the most regular thyroid cancer in clini - cal symptoms . Most PTC has no obvious early symptoms , hence the unobvious symptom and the difficulties lying in the early diagnosis largely affect the effect of the treatment [ 12 ] . In this study , we found that expression of HAX - 1 was up - regulated in human PTC samples compared to normal thyroids by Western blot and immunohistochemistry . On the basis of Oncomine [ 13 ] , a cancer microarray database , HAX - 1 was over - expressed in several types of carcinoma , such as hepatoma , lung cancer , myeloma , and lymphoma . HAX - 1 plays a crucial role in carcinogenesis and has been demon - strated to be up - regulate in multiple tumor cell lines , which provides a strong evidence of its role in tumorigenesis and metastasis . In our results , there was a positive correlation be - tween HAX - 1 expression and TNM stage . HAX - 1 was also closely associated with tumor size . These results are in accordance with the results of other carcinomas . Wang et al . reported that up - regulation of HAX - 1 is positively correlated with cancer grade in hepatocellular carcinoma [ 14 ] , suggesting that HAX - 1 may contribute to the tumorigenesis and progression of PTC . According to our in vitro study , silencing HAX - 1 can remarkably repress cell proliferation , mig - ration , and invasion in two PTC cell lines , TPC1 and K1 . HAX - 1 has been suggested to exert a vital role in the mediation of cell migration [ 7 , 8 ] . The HAX - 1 chaperone HS1 is isogenous to cortactin , which is a cytoskeletal protein mostly elevated in cancer [ 5 ] . Due to the homology Table 1 .

HAX - 1 in papillary thyroid carcinoma 2085 Int J Clin Exp Pathol 2018 ; 11 ( 4 ) : 2080 - 2087 between HS1 and cortactin [ 15 ] , it is possible that HAX - 1 can also bind with cortactin [ 8 ] . Several research studies had demonstrated that cortactin induces the invasion and metas - tasis in tumor cells [ 16 ] . HAX - 1 can bind with cortactin by forming complex , thus promotes migration , while activates cell adhesion due to the lack of HAX - 1 [ 11 , 17 ] . A recent report has suggested that HAX - 1 plays a vital role in the mediation of cancer cell migration and invasion by clathrin - regulated endocytosis [ 8 ] . Silencing of the HAX - 1 gene significantly inhibited cell proliferation , migration , and invasion , which suggests that HAX - 1 is involved in oncogenesis and development of PTC , which may repress differentiation and lymph node metastasis of this malignancy . In our experiment , the expression of cleaved caspase 3 and 9 were also up - regulated when treating with shHAX - 1 . It has been previously reported that HAX - 1 could repress caspase 9 activity . Moreover , it could induce accumulation of BAX ( BCL2 associated X , apoptosis media - tor ) by interacting with HtrA2 ( high temperature regulated A2 ) , thus initiating the apoptotic pathway . HAX - 1 may exert vital anti - apoptotic effects through modulating the mitochondrial pathway [ 5 , 18 - 20 ] . It has been demonstrated that HAX - 1 could prevent cell from mitochon - drial impairment caused by environmental and other factors and reducesecretion of pro - apop - totic signals from the mitochondria membrane [ 21 , 22 ] . In this study , BAX was increased through silencing HAX - 1 , and the apoptotic cell Figure 3 . HAX1 knockdown induced PTC cells apoptosis . A .

HAX - 1 in papillary thyroid carcinoma 2086 Int J Clin Exp Pathol 2018 ; 11 ( 4 ) : 2080 - 2087 death was highly increased as well . Consistent with our studies , it has been suggested that high expression of BAX was represent in human PTC tissues and cell lines . Functional inhibition of HAX - 1 increases apoptosis in two PTC cell lines . We also examined whether the expres - sion of death receptor , DR5 was influenced by shHAX - 1 supplement by Western blot . This result proves that elevated expression of DR5 by shHAX - 1 treatment may contribute to cell death in PTC cell lines . This study also analyzed the cleavage of caspase - 3 and 9 in response to treat with shHAX - 1 , in accordance with a role of apoptosis in HAX - 1 regulated cell death . In addition , we measured expression by Western blotof DR5 , a death receptor by silencing HAX - 1 gene , in two PTC cell lines . Cell death caused by apoptosis is initiated by co - action between death receptor 5 and knockdown HAX - 1 signifi - cantly increased protein expression of DR5 in both cell lines . Apoptosis is a vital mediator of tumorigenesis , which may be promoted by acti - vation of agonists such as the tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) family [ 23 ] . TNF - related apoptosis inducing ligand ( TRAIL ) is a potential death receptor ( DR ) ligands leading to apoptosis via binding with DR in multiple carcinoma cell lines [ 24 , 25 ] . This combination results in the conse - quent activation of caspase 9 , which mediates downstream caspases activationand expres - sion of pro - apoptotic protein BAX . The role of DR signaling pathway during tumor initiation and malignant progression has made it an important regulator in cancer treatment . Conclusion Our results suggest that HAX - 1 is over - express - ed in PTC tissues and that up - regulation of HAX - 1 is related to histological grade , as well as tumor size . Moreover , silencing HAX - 1 promot - ed apoptosis , while inhibiting cell proliferation , migration and invasion . Our study provides novel insight that HAX - 1 may function as a new orientation for PTC therapy .
