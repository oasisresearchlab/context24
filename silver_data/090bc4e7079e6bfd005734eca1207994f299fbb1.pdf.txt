Healthcare Team Members Under COVID - 19 BACKGROUND The COVID - 19 pandemic is likely to put healthcare professionals across the world in an unprecedented situation , having to make impossible decisions and work under extreme pressures ( 1 ) . Among the healthcare workers also , they are involved directly in handling patients and are at greater risk than others . The reasons for such adverse psychological outcomes in them range from excessive workload / work hours , inadequate personal protective equipment , over - enthusiastic media news , and feeling inadequately supported ( 2 , 3 ) . Another important reason for such psychological impact is the infection risk among medical staﬀ . The sudden reversal of role from a healthcare worker to a patient might lead to frustration , helplessness , adjustment issues , stigma , and fear of discrimination in the medical staﬀ ( 4 ) . Despite the low mortality rate of 2 % , the COVID - 19 virus has a high transmission rate and the number of deaths is higher than that caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) and Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS ) combined ( 5 ) . The psychological impact of COVID - 19 and other pandemic among healthcare team members is an important issue to us . In the past , there were several studies ( 6 – 8 ) about the association between mental health and biological disasters ( like SARS , COVID - 19 ) among healthcare members . A previous study reported that mental health problems were associated with social interaction and the ability to cope with COVID - 19 among the general public in Taiwan ( 9 ) . In the face of such biological disaster public health incidents like COVID - 19 , medical staﬀ had massive stress on physical and mental health ( 10 ) . And past studies ( 11 – 15 ) on the psychological impact of the SARS outbreak in Taiwan have focused on the psychiatric morbidity of medical professionals . In Taiwan’s past experience in dealing with SARS , a study by a regional teaching hospital ( 11 ) showed that 17 . 3 % of the medical staﬀ involved in the care of SARS patients had obvious psychiatric symptoms . A follow - up study ( 12 ) after 3 years found that the medical staﬀ with psychiatric symptoms showed that these symptoms were related to the stress of daily life and were less related to the SARS crisis . Compared with nurses , doctors have a higher ratio of physical symptoms , which indicates that diﬀerent professionals suﬀered from diﬀerent stress of mental health . For social distance , many studies ( 16 – 20 ) had showed that the eﬀect of social distance on COVID - 19 was very important . Increasing social distance can signiﬁcantly reduce the infection rate of COVID - 19 ( 19 ) . In a past study ( 21 ) , a massive impact of COVID - 19 and previous epidemics like SARS on social activities was found . As we know , social distance during the COVID - 19 pandemic is necessary to everyone . On the other hand , the interference on social activities may have substantial mental health impacts ( 22 ) .

For social anxiety , a study ( 23 ) indicated a high proportion of anxiety symptoms ( 35 . 1 % ) among the Chinese in China from the online data during the COVID - 19 pandemic . Another study ( 24 ) also indicated higher levels of anxiety were correlated with social isolation and quarantine during the SARS pandemic . Past study ( 18 ) showed that high social anxiety predicted higher perceptions of illness and lower judgments of trustworthiness . Another study ( 25 ) found that anxiety was associated with stress and reduced sleep quality , and the combination of anxiety and stress reduced the positive eﬀects of social capital on sleep quality . A Taiwanese study demonstrates that excessive anxiety because of COVID - 19 is associated with lower subjective psychological well - being ( 26 ) . One past study ( 27 ) showed that social media related information spreading can strongly aﬀect people’s behavior and alter the eﬀectiveness of the countermeasures deployed by governments . The social information may aﬀect the other domains of societal inﬂuence . The signiﬁcant association between receiving information about COVID - 19 from more sources and greater conﬁdence was found in healthcare team members ( 28 ) . Social adaptation implies the intention of subjects to change their behavior and protect themselves to prevent COVID - 19 infection . Several studies ( 29 – 33 ) showed that there were associations between protective behavior and the COVID - 19 pandemic . There may be some factors that aﬀect social adaptation of healthcare team members . Let them be willing to change their behavior and reduce the risk of being infected during the COVID - 19 pandemic . For the quality of life among healthcare team members during the COVID - 19 pandemic , a past study ( 34 ) showed that the quality of life among medical staﬀ was decreased . In a pandemic , healthcare workers face greater risk of infection and undertake higher work intensity as compared with the general population . About the related factors of quality of life among healthcare team members , physical activity , and higher health literacy were found to protect against anxiety and depression and were associated with higher health related quality of life ( 35 ) . Unexpectedly , smoking and drinking were also found to be coping behaviors . It is important to have strategic approaches that protect healthcare team members’ mental health and health related quality of life . Measuring the healthcare workers’ risk perception of the COVID - 19 and the relevant inﬂuential factors can provide the service providers , health policy makers , as well as the health and hygiene instructors with great insights on facilitation of the behaviors aiming at self - eﬀectiveness in improving community health and selecting the best solutions for minimizing the risks arising from this disease . The main aims of this study were ( i ) to investigate the possible factors to the societal inﬂuences and quality of life and ( ii ) to explore interrelationships and underlying mechanisms between societal inﬂuences , mental life quality , physical life quality , and related factors among the healthcare team members in a large psychiatric hospital during the coronavirus infection disease 2019 pandemic in Taiwan . METHODS Subjects A cross - sectional investigation was used in the present study . A total of 716 participants were collected from July 2020 to Frontiers in Psychiatry | www . frontiersin . org 2 October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 706443 Kao et al . Healthcare Team Members Under COVID - 19 September 2020 at a psychiatric teaching hospital in southern Taiwan . Only 33 subjects did not complete questionnaires . A satisfactory response rate of 95 . 3 % was thus obtained . Thus , this study consisted of 683 health care workers , including 44 physicians , 283 nurses , and 356 other hospital healthcare workers . The inclusion criteria were : ( 1 ) participants who worked at a large psychiatric hospital in southern Taiwan , ( 2 ) could understand the objective of the study and follow the instructions from research assistants , ( 3 ) aged between 20 and 65 years , and ( 4 ) informed consent was obtained from all subjects before ﬁlling in the questionnaire . Data with missing values or from those who could not complete the questionnaire were excluded . This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of KSPH ( KSPH - 2020 - 03 ) and conducted according to the current revision of national legal requirements ( Human Subjects Research Act , Taiwan ) . Societal inﬂuences , quality of life , posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) symptoms , levels of depression , sleep disturbance , and related demographic variables were collected through self - reported questionnaires . T - test and Chi - square test were performed on the demographic variables and questionnaires between nursing staﬀ and non - nursing staﬀ . Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to ascertain whether the independent factors were associated with dependent variables , including societal inﬂuences and quality of life ( MCS and PCS ) . Structural equation model ( SEM ) was used to explore the possible factors to the societal inﬂuences and quality of life among healthcare team members in a psychiatric hospital . We also try to ﬁnd out the associations of other latent variables and their relationship to PTSD scales ( PTSD severity score and PTSD frequency score ) , level of depression , and sleep disturbance by path analysis . Measures Demographic Data Data was recorded with the participants’ age , educational years , marital status , gender , religion , types of work in the hospital , smoking ( yes : currently smoking more than ﬁve cigarettes a day or no ) , alcohol use ( ≥ 3 times per week or not ) , Exercises habits ( ≥ 3 days per week or not ) , participation in social activities ( participate in clubs , volunteer or charity activities or not ) , regular intake ( three or four meals a day , ≥ 5 days per week or not ) , chronic physical illness within 1 year , and history of hypertension and diabetes . All of the demographic information was identiﬁed as categorical variables except age and educational years were continuous variables . Societal Inﬂuences Survey Questionnaire ( SISQ ) The Societal Inﬂuences Survey Questionnaire ( SISQ ) was constructed to measure the psychological and social impact on individuals during the COVID - 19 pandemic . With acceptable validity and reliability , the 15 - item SISQ contains ﬁve categories of assessment : social distance , social anxiety , social desirability , social information , and social adaptation ( 36 ) . Ten of the questions were selected in the current study with four domains : social distance , social anxiety , social information , and social adaptation . Cronbach’s alpha of 10 - item SISQ was 0 . 817 in the study . The overall internal consistency coeﬃcient ( Cronbach’s α ) of the 15 - item questions SISQ was 0 . 74 in our past study ( 36 ) . And Cronbach’s alphas were 0 . 76 / 0 . 70 / 0 . 56 / 0 . 54 among social distance / social anxiety / social information / social adaptation four domains . We adapted 10 - item SISQ in our study . Each question was scored on a 4 - point Likert scale , with scores ranging from 1 ( never ) to 4 ( often ) . Higher total scores of each domain ( social distance , social anxiety , social information , and social adaptation ) indicated higher compliance to maintain social distance , higher level of anxiety due to COVID - 19 , more desire to seek related information , and more awareness of progress of the pandemic overseas , respectively . Our past study ( 36 ) demonstrated that the SISQ has acceptable reliability , with Cronbach’s alphas ranging between 0 . 57 and 0 . 76 . The SISQ accounted for 58 . 86 % and satisﬁed the requirement of Kaiser – Mayer – Olkin values ( 0 . 78 ) and signiﬁcant Bartlett’s Test of sphericity . Moreover , the conﬁrmatory factor analysis ﬁt indices also indicated the adequacy of the model . Short Form - 12 Items Health Survey ( SF - 12 ) The 12 - item Short Form Survey version 2 ( SF - 12v2 ) is based on scoring coeﬃcients derived from version 1 of the SF - 36 . It was developed to rapidly estimate general health status and has since been well - validated ( 37 ) . The Short form - 12 items health survey ( SF - 12 ) ( 38 ) is one of the most commonly used health - related quality of life ( HRQoL ) questionnaires , and it has become widely used in community - based health surveys and physical and mental illness outcome assessments due to its brevity and psychometric performance ( 39 , 40 ) . A recent study ( 41 ) showed that PCS and MCS demonstrated high internal consistency ( Cronbach’s α – PCS : 0 . 87 , MCS : 0 . 86 ) and good and moderate test - retest validity , respectively ( intraclass correlation coeﬃcient : PCS : 0 . 79 , MCS : 0 . 59 ) . A previous study ( 42 ) reported acceptable to good levels of reliability for PCS internal consistency coeﬃcient ( ICC ) ( Cronbach’s α = 0 . 78 ) and MCS ICC ( Cronbach’s α = 0 . 60 ) . These items were graded on a 5 - point Likert scale , with scores ranging from 1 ( not at all ) to 5 ( extremely ) . A higher score represented a higher level of interference . And the questionnaire contained two components which were mental component summary ( MCS ) and physical component summary ( PCS ) . So the score of SF - 12v2 was divided into “PCS value of SF - 12” and “MCS value of SF - 12 . ” Depression Score Depression Scales From the Disaster - Related Psychological Screening Test . The level of depression was measured using three questions from the Disaster - Related Psychological Screening Test ( DRPST ) . The DRPST has been shown to be reliable and well - validated to rapidly screen for major depressive disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) after a disaster ( 43 , 44 ) . Three items were used to estimate the status of depressed mood , fatigue or loss of energy , and worthlessness which had persisted for more than 2 weeks in the recent 1 month . Each item was rated on a 2 - point Likert scale , with scores ranging from 0 ( no ) to 1 ( yes ) . In a past study ( 44 ) , a score of 2 or more on the depression scale of DRPST was used to deﬁne positive cases of major Frontiers in Psychiatry | www . frontiersin . org 3 October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 706443 Kao et al . Healthcare Team Members Under COVID - 19 depressive disorder , giving a sensitivity of 92 . 1 % , speciﬁcity of 98 . 3 % , positive predictive value of 83 . 3 % , and negative predictive value of 99 . 3 % . Higher total scores of the three items indicated higher levels of depression . Details of the questionnaire are listed in Supplementary Table 1 . Sleep Score Sleep Disturbance Scales From the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index . The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) was initially developed to measure the sleep quality in clinical populations , and it has been shown to have good validity and reliability ( 45 ) . A global PSQI score > 5 yielded a diagnostic sensitivity of 89 . 6 % and speciﬁcity of 86 . 5 % ( kappa = 0 . 75 , p ≤ 0 . 001 ) in distinguishing good and poor sleepers . And it indicated a reliability coeﬃcient ( Cronbach’s α ) of 0 . 83 . Four items selected from the PSQI were used to estimate the level of sleep disturbance : diﬃculty to fall asleep , waking up in the middle of the night , subjective sleep quality , and enthusiasm in the recent 1 month ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Each item was rated on a 4 - point Likert scale , with scores ranging from 1 to 4 . Higher total scores of the four items indicated more severe sleep disturbance . Post - Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) Symptoms Post - Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) Scales From the Disaster - Related Psychological Screening Test . The levels of PTSD symptoms were measured using eight questions from the Disaster - Related Psychological Screening Test ( DRPST ) . The DRPST has been shown to be reliable and well - validated to rapidly screen for major depressive disorder or post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) after a disaster ( 43 , 44 ) . A score of 3 or more on the PTSD scale of DRPST was used to deﬁne the positive cases ; this resulted in the most appropriate sensitivity ( 97 . 8 % ) and speciﬁcity ( 96 . 6 % ) , a positive predictive value of 76 . 3 % , and a negative predictive value of 99 . 8 % . The PTSD scales divided into two components : PTSD severity score and PTSD frequency score . Eight items of PTSD severity and PTSD frequency were used to estimate the status of PTSD in the recent 1 month . Each item was rated on a 5 - point Likert scale , with scores ranging from 1 ( PTSD severity : no distress ; PTSD frequency : never ) to 5 ( PTSD severity : extremely distress ; PTSD frequency : every day ) . Higher total scores of the eight items indicated higher levels of PTSD severity and PTSD frequency . Details of the questionnaire are listed in Supplementary Table 1 . Statistical Analysis Because nursing staﬀ accounted for a large proportion of the overall number of nursing staﬀ in the hospital , and in our study , 283 of all 683 cases were nursing staﬀ , accounting for 41 . 5 % , and nursing staﬀ often had to work in shifts . The work style is diﬀerent , so we divide all cases into two groups of nursing staﬀ and non - care staﬀ . T - test and Chi - square test were performed on the demographic variables and questionnaires between nursing staﬀ and non - nursing staﬀ . Marital status was transformed into a dichotomous variable as “married” ( married and remarried ) or “unmarried” ( single , widowed , cohabiting , and divorced ) ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . Histories of chronic illness were also transformed into dichotomous variables as “yes” or “no” ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . The data were analyzed using the IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows , Version 21 . 0 ( IBM Corp . Released 2012 . Armonk , NY : IBM Corp ) . Baseline characteristics and the scores of questionnaires were compared using an independent T - test or the chi - square test . Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to ascertain whether the independent factors were associated with dependent variables , including SISQ total score _ 10 , PCS value of SF - 12 , and MCS value of SF - 12 . The alpha level was set at 0 . 05 . The normality of dependent variables was checked using the Kolmogorov - Smirnov test . Because non - normally distributed samples were identiﬁed with the signiﬁcance of the test ( p < 0 . 001 ) , bootstrapping multiple linear regression with 1 , 000 bootstrap samples was used to verify the results from the stepwise multi - variate linear regression analysis . In the bootstrapping method , 95 % conﬁdence intervals were used to determine statistical signiﬁcance , as this could qualify the stability of the regression coeﬃcients and reduce the length of the conﬁdence interval ( 46 ) . When the 95 % conﬁdence interval of a regression coeﬃcient did not contain zero , the variable was statistically signiﬁcant . In addition , the number of bootstrap samples was set as 1 , 000 to obtain suﬃciently accurate 95 % bootstrap percentile ( 47 ) . The AMOS 21 . 0 ( SPSS , Chicago , IL , USA ) was used to analyze the structural equation model ( SEM ) . SEM uses the chi - square ﬁt test to investigate the overall ﬁt into the model ; chi - squares resulting in P > 0 . 05 and an adjusted goodness - of - ﬁt index > 0 . 9 indicated that the model adequately describes the observed data . Root Mean Square Error of Approximation ( RMSEA ) is based on the non - centrality parameter . Good models have an RMSEA of 0 . 05 or less . Models whose RMSEA is 0 . 10 or less were necessary ( 48 ) . Values for the SRMR range from 0 to 1 . 0 with well - ﬁtting models obtaining values < 0 . 05 ( 49 , 50 ) , however values as high as 0 . 08 are deemed acceptable ( 51 ) . Furthermore , we explore the possible factors to the societal inﬂuences and quality of life among healthcare team members in a psychiatric hospital by SEM . We also try to ﬁnd out the associations of other latent variables and their relationship to quality of life , PTSD scales , depression , and sleep by path analysis . RESULTS A total of 716 participants were collected from July 2020 to September 2020 at a large psychiatric teaching hospital in southern Taiwan . Only 33 subjects did not complete questionnaires . A satisfactory response rate of 95 . 3 % was thus obtained . And 33 subjects who did not complete questionnaires were older and had fewer education years than 683 subjects who completed questionnaires . In other demographic data ( like gender , diﬀerent healthcare professions , smoking , or not ) , there were no statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences . Thus , this study consisted of 683 health care workers , including 44 physicians , 283 nurses , and 356 other hospital health care workers .

Demographic Data and Questionnaires Between Nursing Staff and Non - Nursing Staff In Table 1 , we used T - test and Chi - square test to compare the diﬀerence of demographic data and questionnaires between two groups ( nursing staﬀ group vs . non - nursing staﬀ group ) . We found that non - nursing staﬀ group had more male than nursing staﬀ group ( χ 2 = 45 . 238 , P < 0 . 001 ) , non - nursing staﬀ were older than nursing staﬀ ( T = 97 . 569 , P < 0 . 001 ) , more non - nursing staﬀ were married than nursing staﬀ ( χ 2 = 7 . 229 , P = 0 . 007 ) , more non - nursing staﬀ had religion belief than nursing staﬀ ( χ 2 = 7 . 127 , P = 0 . 008 ) , more non - nursing staﬀ had smoking than nursing staﬀ ( χ 2 = 13 . 593 , P < 0 . 001 ) , and more non - nursing staﬀ had exercise habits ( χ 2 = 38 . 018 , P < 0 . 001 ) , regular intake ( χ 2 = 42 . 985 , P < 0 . 001 ) , and participate in social activities ( χ 2 = 28 . 989 , P < 0 . 001 ) than nursing staﬀ . More non - nursing staﬀ had chronic physical illness than nursing staﬀ ( χ 2 = 5 . 384 , P = 0 . 020 ) within 1 year , more non - nursing staﬀ had hypertension than nursing staﬀ ( χ 2 = 4 . 752 , P = 0 . 029 ) , and more non - nursing staﬀ had DM than nursing staﬀ ( χ 2 = 5 . 958 , P = 0 . 015 ) . There were no signiﬁcant statistically diﬀerences over alcohol use ( χ 2 = 0 . 032 , P = 0 . 859 ) and education years ( T = 2 . 689 , P = 0 . 015 ) between two groups . In the questionnaires , nursing staﬀ group had more social anxiety ( T = 6 . 046 , P = 0 . 014 ) and less social information ( T = 3 . 894 , P = 0 . 049 ) than non - nursing staﬀ group . Nursing staﬀ had more sleep disturbance than non - nursing staﬀ under sleep score analysis ( T = 9 . 281 , P = 0 . 002 ) . Nursing staﬀ had lower score of MCS value than non - nursing staﬀ among SF - 12v2 analysis ( T = 13 . 259 , P < 0 . 001 ) . There were no signiﬁcant statistically diﬀerences over SISQ total score ( T = 0 . 428 , P = 0 . 513 ) , social distance ( T = 3 . 385 , P = 0 . 066 ) , social adaption ( T = 0 . 093 , P = 0 . 760 ) , PCS value of SF - 12v2 ( T = 2 . 855 , P = 0 . 092 ) , depression score ( T = 0 . 723 , P = 0 . 396 ) , PTSD frequency score ( T = 0 . 021 , P = 0 . 885 ) , and PTSD severity score ( T = 0 . 675 , P = 0 . 412 ) . Multiple Linear Regression for Possible Related Factors of Total SISQ Score After multiple linear regression ( Table 2 ) , we found that female ( β = 0 . 143 ; P < 0 . 001 ) , older subjects ( β = 0 . 113 ; P = 0 . 005 ) , more education years ( β = 0 . 103 ; P = 0 . 004 ) , had marriage ( β = 0 . 077 ; P = 0 . 049 ) , regular intake ( β = 0 . 109 ; P = 0 . 003 ) , and PTSD frequency score ( β = 0 . 313 ; P < 0 . 001 ) all had positive association with SISQ score . After veriﬁcation with 1 , 000 bootstrapping multiple linear regressions , the signiﬁcant related factors were the same as in multiple linear regression ( Supplementary Table 4 ) .

In our SEM model , our P - value is 0 . 422 ( > 0 . 05 ) , adjusted goodness - of - ﬁt index ( AGFI ) is 0 . 977 ( > 0 . 9 ) , RMSEA is 0 . 019 ( < 0 . 05 ) , and SRMR is 0 . 0318 ( < 0 . 05 ) which indicated that our model is a good model and adequately describes the data in our study . In Figure 1 , we showed that PTSD ( two components : PTSD severity and PTSD frequency ) had positive inﬂuence on SISQ ( four components : social information , social adaption , social distance , and social anxiety ) . Otherwise , sleep score and MCS value both had negative inﬂuences on SISQ . Age had a positive inﬂuence on social information and social distance . Education years had a positive inﬂuence on social adaption . Nursing staﬀ had a positive inﬂuence on social anxiety . PTSD severity had a positive inﬂuence on sleep score and a negative inﬂuence on PCS value . PTSD frequency had a positive inﬂuence on depression score and a negative inﬂuence on MCS value . Depression score and nursing staﬀ had a positive inﬂuences on sleep score . Age had a positive inﬂuence on MCS value and a negative inﬂuence on PCS value .

DISCUSSION To the best of our knowledge , our study is the ﬁrst study to focus on the related impact factors of societal inﬂuences , quality of life , and investigate interrelationships between societal inﬂuences , mental health , physical health , post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , age , sleep score , depression score , nursing staﬀ or not , and smoking among healthcare team members in a large psychiatric hospital . In multiple linear regressions , PTSD frequency score had positive association with SISQ score . In SEM analysis , PTSD also had positive inﬂuence on SISQ . However , sleep score and MCS value both had negative inﬂuences on SISQ . We can conclude that healthcare team members who had more severe PTSD symptoms suﬀered more societal inﬂuences in a psychiatric hospital under the COVID - 19 pandemic . On the other hand , healthcare team members who had poor sleep and mental health quality had fewer societal inﬂuences in a psychiatric hospital during the COVID - 19 pandemic . Furthermore , multiple linear regression analysis for possible related factors of social distance , social anxiety , social information , and social adaptation ( four domain of SISQ ) were used ( Supplementary Tables 7 – 10 ) . We found that PTSD frequency score had positive association with four domains of SISQ . Sleep score and MCS value only had negative association with social anxiety . Depressive score had an indirect negative inﬂuence on SISQ by sleep score and indirect positive inﬂuence on SISQ by MCS value . We cannot understand whether the healthcare team members with higher depression score would suﬀer from more societal inﬂuences in a large psychiatric hospital during the COVID - 19 pandemic . Then we also used ANOVA test to compare the SISQ score between four groups ( Depression score = 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , data showed at Supplementary Table 11 ) , there was no signiﬁcant statistical diﬀerence between four groups . The major threat of the COVID - 19 pandemic has seriously aﬀected people’s mental health ( 9 , 52 , 53 ) . And healthcare team members are also under such threats , and their mental health has also been severely impacted ( 53 , 54 ) . Our research focused on the diﬀerences in the mental health impacts among diﬀerent types of healthcare team members who suﬀered threats in a psychiatric hospital under the COVID - 19 pandemic . We found that there is no diﬀerence in their total SISQ scores regardless of whether they are nursing staﬀ or not , but the score of nursing staﬀ in social anxiety was higher , while the score of nursing staﬀ in social information was lower , which shows that nursing staﬀ is more anxious in the face of COVID - 19 pandemic , but they receive less social information . COVID - 19 had more eﬀect on the mental health of non - nursing staﬀ than nursing staﬀ . On the other hand , we can ﬁnd that the score of nursing staﬀ in MCS value was lower , while the score of sleep score was higher , which showed that the mental health of nursing staﬀ was poor , and the sleep quality was worse . This may be related to the nature of the work that nursing staﬀ required more shifts . In the lifestyle analysis , we found that nursing staﬀ had fewer exercise habits , less regular intake , and less participation in social activities which may be due to their working style . Most nursing staﬀ requires shifts among their work that lead to poor lifestyle . A past study ( 55 ) showed that 70 nurses ( 63 % ) worked nightshifts within the past year and poor sleep quality was the lifestyle factor which most strongly contributed to fatigue . We also found that the proportion of women in this group of nursing staﬀ is relatively high , and they are younger . Some diﬀerences in scale scores , lifestyle ( smoking , exercises habits , participate in social activities , regular intake ) , and the presence or absence of chronic diseases under T - test and Chi - square test may be due to diﬀerences in gender and age causing this statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerence . It is possible to form Type I error , so we used multiple linear regression analysis to ascertain whether the independent factors were associated with dependent variables , including SISQ score and quality of life ( MCS and PCS ) . And the SISQ , MCS value , PCS value , PTSD symptoms , age , sleep score , depression score , nursing staﬀ or not , gender , education years , and smoking and other related factors were included in the structural equation model ( SEM ) analysis , so that Type I error caused by the use of T - test and Chi - square test can be avoided . However , a past study ( 12 ) about SARS in Taiwan showed that the major diﬀerence between the mental health of the nurses and the other healthcare workers was in the somatic realm ( headache , palpitations , discomfort in the chest , and numbness of the limbs ) in that the nurses had fewer complaints and symptoms . Under SEM analysis in our study , nursing staﬀ had positive inﬂuence on social anxiety . Nursing staﬀ had positive inﬂuence on sleep score . Nursing staﬀ had negative inﬂuence on PCS value . So we need to let our nursing staﬀ get more social information , and nursing staﬀ may need more psychological intervention to improve their social anxiety , sleep disturbance , and life quality during the COVID - 19 pandemic in the future . In the multiple linear regression analysis , PTSD frequency score had positive association with SISQ score and PTSD severity score had no association with SISQ score . We can conclude that relative to PTSD severity score , PTSD frequency score was more important to the societal inﬂuences among healthcare team members in a psychiatric hospital during the COVID - 19 pandemic . On the other hand , older female and married members suﬀered from more societal inﬂuences during the COVID - 19 pandemic . Healthcare team members with higher education level , regular intake suﬀered from more societal inﬂuences during the COVID - 19 pandemic . A past study ( 56 ) showed that culture factor also had inﬂuences on social distance during the COVID - 19 pandemic . But we can’t consider the culture diﬀerence in a single - center study . Sleep score and MCS value only had negative eﬀect to social anxiety , not aﬀecting other domains of SISQ . Another study ( 57 ) showed that medical staﬀ had higher anxiety scores and depression scores than general population and the gender , age , marriage , working years , Frontiers in Psychiatry | www . frontiersin . org 8 October 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 706443 Kao et al . Healthcare Team Members Under COVID - 19 occupation , educational level , and economic income did not aﬀect anxiety and depression . However , we did not investigate the related questionnaires among the general population in our study . In the multiple linear regressions , PTSD frequency score had a negative association with MCS value and PCS value of Short form - 12 items health survey and PTSD severity score had no association with MCS value and PCS value . We can conclude that relative to PTSD severity score , PTSD frequency score was more important to the quality of life ( physical and mental ) among healthcare team members in a psychiatric hospital during the COVID - 19 pandemic . However , MCS value and PCS had eﬀects on each other which means there was a strong association between the physical component and mental component of quality life . Members with sleep problems may worsen their life quality among physical component and mental component , and a past study ( 58 ) also had a similar ﬁnding . Members with chronic illness with 1 year , smoking , and fewer exercise habits had poor life quality among physical component , like past studies ( 59 – 61 ) . Members with older age , participation in social activities frequently had better life quality on mental component . As in past studies ( 62 , 63 ) , depression can worsen the life quality among mental component . Among the association between societal inﬂuences and quality of life among healthcare team members in a psychiatric hospital under COVID - 19 pandemic , members with higher social distance scores had poor life quality among physical component . Members with higher social anxiety scores had poor life quality among mental component . Members with higher social information scores had better life quality among mental component . Limitation of the Study First , societal inﬂuences and quality of life , other related factors like level of depression , sleep disturbance , and PTSD were measured by self - reported questionnaires in our study , and it would have been better if they had been veriﬁed through objective observations for related factors in our study . Second , the cross - sectional design of this study limited causal inference for further interpretation . A repeat measurement study may be considered to perform in the future . Finally , a single - center study may limit the generalizability and applicability to other populations . CONCLUSION Healthcare team members who had more severe PTSD symptoms suﬀered more societal inﬂuences . Relative to PTSD severity score , PTSD frequency score was more important to the societal inﬂuences and quality of life among healthcare team members . On the other hand , older female and married members suﬀered from more societal inﬂuences . Health care team members with higher education level , regular intake suﬀered from more societal inﬂuences . Sleep problems may worse physical life quality and mental life quality , and depression may worse mental life quality . Members with chronic illness with 1 year , smoking , and fewer exercise habits had poor physical life quality . Members of older age , who frequently participate in social activities had better life quality among mental component .
