The virtually transparent embryos of this species , and the ability to accelerate genetic studies by gene knock - down or overexpression , have led to the widespread use of zebrafish in the detailed investigation of vertebrate gene function and increas - ingly , the study of human genetic disease 3 – 5 . However , for effective modelling of human genetic disease it is important to understand the extent to which zebrafish genes and gene structuresare related to orthologous human genes . To examine this , we generated a high - quality sequence assembly of the zebrafish genome , made up of an overlappingsetofcompletelysequencedlarge - insertclonesthatwere ordered and oriented using a high - resolution high - density meiotic map . Detailed automatic and manual annotation provides evidence of more than 26 , 000 protein - coding genes 6 , the largest gene set of anyvertebratesofarsequenced . Comparisontothehumanreference genome shows that approximately 70 % of human genes have at least one obvious zebrafish orthologue . In addition , the high quality of this genome assembly provides a clearer understanding of key geno - mic features such as a unique repeat content , a scarcity of pseudo - genes , an enrichment of zebrafish - specific genes on chromosome 4 and chromosomal regions that influence sex determination . The zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) was first identified as a genetically tract - able organism in the 1980s . The systematic application of genetic screens led to the phenotypic characterization of a large collection of mutations 1 , 2 . These mutations , when driven to homozygosity , can pro - duce defects in a variety of organ systems with pathologies similar to human disease . Such investigations have also contributed notably to our understanding of basic vertebrate biology and vertebrate deve - lopment . In addition to enabling the systematic definition of a large range of early developmental phenotypes , screens in zebrafish have contributed more generally to our understanding of the factors con - trolling the specification of cell types , organ systems and body axes of vertebrates 7 – 9 . Although its contributions have already been substantial , zebrafish research holds further promise to enhance our understanding of the detailed roles of specific genes in human diseases , both rare and com - mon . Increasingly , zebrafish experiments are included in studies of human genetic disease , often providing independent verification of the activity of a gene implicated in a human disease 3 , 5 , 10 . Essential to this enterprise is a high - quality genome sequence and complete anno - tation of zebrafish protein - coding genes with identification of their human orthologues . * Theseauthorscontributedequallytothiswork . 1 WellcomeTrustSangerInstitute , WellcomeTrustGenomeCampus , Hinxton , CambridgeCB101SA , UK . 2 TheGenomeAnalysisCentre , NorwichResearchPark , NorwichNR47UH , UK . 3 BioinformaticsUnit , CentroNacionaldeInvestigacionesCardiovasculares , 28029Madrid , Spain . 4 EcoleNormaleSupe´rieure , InstitutdeBiologiedel’ENS , IBENS , 46rued’Ulm , ParisF - 75005 , France . 5 INSERM , U1024 , 46rue d’Ulm , ParisF - 75005 , France . 6 CNRS , UMR8197 , 46rued’Ulm , ParisF - 75005 , France . 7 EMBLEuropeanBioinformaticsInstitute , WellcomeTrustGenomeCampus , Hinxton , CambridgeCB101SD , UK . 8 IlluminaCambridge , ChesterfordResearchPark , LittleChesterford , SaffronWaldenCB101XL , UK . 9 HubrechtLaboratory , Uppsalalaan8 , 3584CTUtrecht , TheNetherlands . 10 MaxPlanckInstitutefor DevelopmentalBiology , Spemannstraße35 , 72076Tu¨bingen , Germany . 11 StemCellProgramandDivisionofHematologyandOncology , Children’sHospitalandDanaFarberCancerInstitute , 1Blackfan Circle , Karp7 , Boston , Massachusetts02115 , USA . 12 Children’sHospitalOakland , 74752ndStreet , Oakland , California94609 , USA . 13 InstituteofNeuroscience , UniversityofOregon , 1254Universityof Oregon , 222HuestisHall , Eugene , Oregon97403 - 1254 , USA . 14 KarlsruheInstituteofTechnology ( KIT ) , CampusNorth , InstituteofToxicologyandGentics ( ITG ) , Hermann - von - Helmholtz - Platz1 , 76344 Eggenstein - Leopoldshafen , Germany . 15 DepartmentofPathology , BrighamandWomen’sHospitalandHarvardMedicalSchool , Boston , Massachusetts02115 , USA . 0 0 M O N T H 2 0 1 3 | V O L 0 0 0 | N AT U R E | 1 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved ©201 3 The zebrafish genome - sequencing project was initiated at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in 2001 . We chose Tu¨bingen as the zebrafish reference strain as it had been used extensively to identify mutationsaffectingembryogenesis 2 . Ourstrategyresembledtheclone - by - clone sequencing approach adopted previously for both the human and mouse genome projects . The Zv9 assembly is a hybrid of high - qualityfinishedclonesequence ( 83 % ) andwhole - genomeshotgun ( WGS ) sequence ( 17 % ) , with a total size of 1 . 412gigabases ( Gb ) ( Table 1 ) . The cloneandWGSsequenceistiedtoahigh - resolution , high - densitymeiotic map called the Sanger AB Tu¨bingen map ( SATmap ) , named after the strains of zebrafish used to make the map ( Supplementary Information ) . Zebrafish are members of the teleostei infraclass , a monophyletic group that is thought to have arisen approximately 340 million years ago from a common ancestor 11 . Compared to other vertebrate species , this ancestor underwent an additional round of whole - genome dupli - cation ( WGD ) called the teleost - specific genome duplication ( TSD ) 12 . Gene duplicates that result from this process are called ohnologues ( after Susumu Ohno who suggested this mechanism of gene duplica - tion ) 13 . Zebrafish possess 26 , 206 protein - coding genes 6 , more than any previously sequenced vertebrate , and they have a higher number of species - specific genes in their genome than do human , mouse or chicken . Some of this increased gene number is likely to be a con - sequence of the TSD . A direct comparison of the zebrafish and human protein - coding genes reveals a number of interesting features . First , 71 . 4 % of human genes have at least one zebrafish orthologue , as defined by Ensembl Compara 14 ( Table 2 ) . Reciprocally , 69 % of zebrafish genes have at least one human orthologue . Among the orthologous genes , 47 % of human genes have a one - to - one relationship with a zebrafish orthologue . The second largest orthology class contains human genes that are assoc - iated with many zebrafish genes ( the ‘one - human - to - many - zebrafish’ class ) , with an average of 2 . 28 zebrafish genes for each human gene , andthisprobablyreflectstheTSD . A fewnotablehuman geneshaveno clearly identifiable zebrafish orthologue ; for example , the leukaemia inhibitory factor ( LIF ) , oncostatin M ( OSM ) or interleukin - 6 ( IL6 ) genes , although the receptors lifra , lifrb , osmr and il6r are clearly present in the zebrafish genome . It is possible that zebrafish proteins with functionally similar activities to LIF , OSM and IL - 6 exist , but that their sequence divergence is so great that they cannot be recognized as orthologues . Similarly , thezebrafishgenomehasno BRCA1 orthologue , but does have an orthologue of the BRCA1 - associated BARD1 gene , which encodes an associated and functionally similar protein and a brca2 gene , which plays an important role in oocyte development , probably reflecting its role in DNA damage repair 15 . Zebrafish have been used successfully to understand the biological activity of genes orthologous to human disease - related genes in greater detail 3 – 5 . To investigate the number of potential disease - related genes , we compared the list of human genes possessing at least one zebrafish orthologue with the 3 , 176 genes bearing morbidity descriptions that are listed in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man ( OMIM ) data - base . Of these morbid genes , 2 , 601 ( 82 % ) can be related to at least one zebrafish orthologue . A similar comparison identified at least one zebrafish orthologue for 3 , 075 ( 76 % ) of the 4 , 023 human genes impli - cated in genome wide association studies ( GWAS ) . Zv9 shows an overall repeat content of 52 . 2 % , the highest reported so far in a vertebrate . All other sequenced teleost fish exhibit a much lower repeat content , with an average of less than 30 % . This result suggeststhattheevolutionarypathleadingtothezebrafishexperiencedanexpansionofrepeats , possiblyfacilitatedbyapopulationbottleneck . Alternatively , the repeat content of the other sequenced teleost species may be under - represented , as these assemblies are mostly WGS 16 . The majority of transposable elements found in the human genome are type I ( retrotransposable elements ) , with more than 4 . 3 million placements covering 44 % of the sequence , whereas only 11 % of the zebrafish genome sequence is covered by type I elements in less than 500 , 000instances . Incontrast , thezebrafishgenomecontainsamarked excess of type II DNA transposable elements . Indeed , 2 . 3 million instances of type II DNA transposable elements cover 39 % of the zebrafish genome sequence ( Supplementary Table 12 ) , whereas type II repeats cover only 3 . 2 % of the human genome . This pronounced abundance of type II transposable elements is unique among the sequenced vertebrate genomes , and the genome sequence shows evidence of recently active type II transposable ele - ments . The closest vertebrate species in terms of the abundance of type II transposable elements is Xenopus tropicalis ( 25 % type II transpos - able elements ) , whereas the sequenced and annotated teleost fish ( the pufferfish Takifugu and Tetraodon , the three - spined stickleback ( Gas - terosteus aculeatus ) and the medaka ( Oryzias latipes ) ) each possess type II transposable element coverage of less than 10 % , which may relate to the fact that the zebrafish genome diverges basally from the other sequenced and annotated teleost genomes 17 . Zebrafish type II transposable elements are divided into 14superfamilies with 401 repeat families in total ( Supplementary Table 12 ) . The DNA and hAT superfamilies are the most abundant and diverse in the zebrafish genome , together covering 28 % of the sequence . The type II transpos - able element abundance of zebrafish , or lack of retrotransposable ele - ments , may provide an explanation for the low zebrafish pseudogene content ( Supplementary Table 14 ) . The long arm of chromosome4 is unique among zebrafish genomic regions , owing toitsrelativelack of protein - codinggenes anditsexten - sive heterochromatin . Chromosome 4 is known to be late - replicating and hybridization studies suggest that genomic copies of 5S ribosomal DNA ( rDNA ) , which are not notably present on any other chro - mosome , are scattered along the long arm at high redundancy 18 .

A4 ) shows a remarkable increase in repeat content , which continues through to the telomere of the long arm . At approximately 27Mb , the otherwise uniform presence of the satellite repeat SAT - 2 on the long arm ends abruptly . This location is also the starting point of uniform MOSAT - 2 distribution , a satellite repeat that is nearly absent from all other chromosomes but highly enriched on the long arm of chromosome 4 . The subtelomeric region of the long arm shows a distinct distribution of repeat elements , with relatively fewer inter - spersed elements and an increased content of satellite , simple and tandem repeats that do not harbour 5SrDNA sequences . Moreover , the gene content is reduced on the long arm and the guanine – cytosine content is slightly increased . z 10280 B X 537156 z 20450 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 020406080 d c 020406080 b 0 5 10 a Homozygousgrandparents ~ 7 million SNPs Heterozygousgenetically identical parents 430 F 2 s genotyped at 140 , 000 SNPs Sex identified × × P F 1 F 2 Doubled haploid Tübingen strain Tü / AB Tü / AB a b c Doubled haploid AB strain 1 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Chromosome 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 0 . 8 Tü / Tü MaleFemale Tü / AB AB / AB 0 10 Position ( Mb ) F r ac t i o n – l og 10 P v a l u e 20 30 40 50 60 0 . 4 0 . 0 Figure 2 | Sex determination signal on chromosome16 . a , BreedingschemeforSATmap .

This number of SNPs between just two homozygous zebrafish individuals is far in excess of that seen between any two humans and is nearly one - fifth of all SNPs measured among 1 , 092 human diploid genomes 29 . Genetically identical , heterozygous F 1 fish of both sexes resulted from crossing the founders . The F 1 individuals were crossed to generate a panel of F 2 individuals , each with its own unique set of meiotic recombinations between AB and Tu¨bingen ( Tu¨ ) chromosomes , which were uncovered by dense genotyping with a set of 140 , 306 SNPs covering most of the genome . b , Genome - wide P values for tests of genotype difference between sexes , arranged by chromosome .

All rights reserved ©201 3 The long arm of chromosome 4 also has a special structure with respect to gene orthology and synteny . Approximately 80 % of the genes present have no identifiable orthologues in human . In fact , 110 genes ( out of 663 ) have no identifiable orthologues in any other sequenced teleost genome and indeed seem to be zebrafish - specific genes . The genes in this region are highly duplicated , with 31ancestral gene families alone providing 77 . 5 % of the genes , the largest of which contains no less than 109duplicates in this region . The largest of these families correspond to NOD - like receptor proteins 19 with putative roles in innate immunity and zinc finger proteins . We also observed a very high density of small nuclear RNAs ( snRNAs ) on chromosome 4 , and in particular those that encode spliceosome components . The cohort of snRNAs carried on the long arm of chromosome 4 accounts for 53 . 2 % of all snRNAs in the zebrafish genome . In addition , in a specific group of zebrafish derived recently from a natural population , the subtelomeric region of the long arm of chromosome 4 has been found to contain a major sex determinant with alleles that are 100 % predictive of male development and 85 % predictive of female develop - ment , suggesting that this chromosome may be , might have been , or may be becoming , a sex chromosome in this particular population 20 . In addition to the chromosome 4 sex determinant , three other sepa - rate genomic regions have been identified as influencing sex deter - mination , and these vary between the strains and even within the families studied 20 , 21 . Our meiotic map , SATmap , which was generated to anchor the genomic sequence , provided an opportunity to examine whetherthereareanystrongsignalsforsexdetermination . Togenerate SATmap we took advantage of the fact that it is possible to create double haploid individuals that contain only maternally derived DNA , that are homozygous at every locus and that can be raised until they are fertile 22 ( Fig . 2a ) . To investigate the interesting finding that SATmap F 1 fish could be either male or female while being genetically identical and heterozygous at every polymorphic locus , we sought a genetic signal for sex determination in the F 2 generation , in which these polymorphisms segregate . Using morphological secondary sex - ual traits , we were able to score the sexof 332genotyped F 2 individuals . Although most chromosomes showed no significant genetic bias for a particular sex , we found that most of chromosome 16 carried a strong signal ( P 5 9 . 1 3 10 2 7 ) with a broad peak around the centromere ( Fig . 2b , c ) . Homozygotes for the Tu¨bingen ( grandmaternal ) allele had a very high probability of being female , whereas homozygotes for the AB ( grandpaternal ) allele were very unlikely to be female ( Fig . 2 ) . The number of protein - coding genes among vertebrates is rela - tively stable , although even closely related species may show great dis - parities in the nature of their protein - coding gene content . We carried out a four - way comparison between the proteome of two mammals ( human and mouse ) , a bird ( chicken ) and the zebrafish to quantify the fraction of shared and species - specific genes present in each genome ( Fig . 3a ) . A core group of 10 , 660genes is found in all four species and probably approximates an essential set of vertebrate protein - coding genes . This number is somewhat less than the core set of 11 , 809ver - tebrate genes identified previously as being common to three fish genomes ( Tetraodon , medaka , zebrafish ) and three amniotes ( human , mouse , chicken ) 16 , but the discrepancy probably reflects the improved annotation of these genomes that often results in fusing fragmented gene structures . Each taxon has between 2 , 596 and 3 , 634 species - specific genes . The notable excess observed in zebrafish may be a consequence of the WGD , because pairs of duplicated genes that arose from the WGD , but with no orthologue in amniotes , are counted as two specific genes . Furthermore , 2 , 059genes are found in human , mouse and zebrafish but not in chicken , and this number is two times higher than the number of genes that are found in all amniotes but not in zebrafish ( 892 ) . It is unclear whether these genes have been lost along the evolutionary branch leading to the chicken , or whether this is due to annotation or orthology assignation errors in the chi - cken genome . We identified double - conserved synteny ( DCS ) blocks between all sequencedtetrapodsandfourfishgenomes ( zebrafish , medaka , stickle - back and Tetraodon ) . DCS blocks are defined as runs of genes in the non - duplicated species that are found on two different chromosomes in the species that underwent a WGD 23 , although the genes may not be adjacent in the duplicated species 24 . The DCS between zebrafish and human are represented on either side of each human chromosome ( Supplementary Fig . 15 ) . Using DCS blocks , we identified zebrafish paralogous genes that are part of DCS blocks and consistent with the locally alternating chromosomes , hence with an origin at the TSD . We identified 3 , 440 pairs of such ohnologues ( 26 % of the all genes ) , for a total of 8 , 083genes when subsequent duplications are taken into account . It is notable that although true pairs of ohnologues may exist within the same chromosome owing to post - TSD rearrangements , we excluded such cases as we cannot reliably distinguish them from segmental duplications .

We compared the 8 , 083zebrafish TSD ohnologues with human ohnologues originating from the two rounds of WGD that are com - mon to all vertebrates and find that the two sets overlap strongly ( chi - squaredtest , P , 2 3 10 2 16 ) . Ingeneral , zebrafishohnologous pairsare enriched in specific functions ( neural activity , transcription factors ) and are orthologous to mammalian genes under stronger evolutionary constraint than genes that have lost their second copy . A circular representation of ohnologue pairs ( Fig . 3b ) highlights chromosomes , or parts of chromosomes , that descended from the same pre - duplication ancestral chromosome ( for example , chromo - somes3and12 , 17and20 , 16and19 ) . Amongzebrafishchromosomes , chromosome 16 and chromosome 19 are unique in their one - to - one conservation of synteny . Consistent with the conservation of synteny , chromosome 16 and chromosome 19 possess clusters of orthologues of genes associated with the mammalian major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) as well as the hoxab and hoxaa clusters , respectively , which are each orthologous to the human HOXA cluster 25 . Since the earliest whole - genome shotgun - only assembly became public in 2002 , the zebrafish reference genome sequence has enabled many new discoveries to be made , in particular the positional cloning of hundreds of genes from mutations affecting embryogenesis , beha - viour , physiology , and health and disease . Moreover , the annotated reference genome hasenabled thegeneration of accurate whole - exome enrichment reagents , which are accelerating both positional cloning projectsandnewgenome - widemutationdiscoveryefforts 26 , 27 . Although the zebrafish reference genome sequencing is complete , a few poorly assembled regions remain , which are being resolved by the Genome Reference Consortium ( http : / / genomereference . org ) . METHODS SUMMARY We generated cloned libraries of large fragments of genomic DNA , assembled a physical map of large - insert clones and completely sequenced a set of minimally overlapping clones . In addition , we generated WGS sequences by end - sequencing a mixture of large - and short - insert libraries . Overlapping clone sequences were combined with WGS sequences and tied to the meiotic map , SATmap , which enabledindependentplacementandorientationofclonesinthegenomesequence . The sequence data can be found in the BioProject database , under accession number PRJNA11776 .
