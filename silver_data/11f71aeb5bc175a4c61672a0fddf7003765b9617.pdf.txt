L E T T E R S 268 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 6 | NUMBER 3 | MARCH 2004 Abl - dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Sos - 1 mediates growth - factor - induced Rac activation Patrizia Sini 1 , Angela Cannas 1 , Anthony J . Koleske 4 , Pier Paolo Di Fiore 1 , 2 , 3 and Giorgio Scita 1 The non - receptor tyrosine kinase Abl participates in receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) - induced actin cytoskeleton remodelling , a signalling pathway in which the function of Rac is pivotal . More importantly , the activity of Rac is indispensable for the leukaemogenic ability of the BCR - Abl oncoprotein . Thus , Rac might function downstream of Abl and be activated by it . Here , we elucidate the molecular mechanisms through which Abl signals to Rac in RTK - activated pathways . We show that Sos - 1 , a dual guanine nucleotide - exchange factor ( GEF ) , is phosphorylated on tyrosine , after activation of RTKs , in an Abl - dependent manner . Sos - 1 and Abl interact in vivo , and Abl - induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Sos - 1 is sufficient to elicit its Rac - GEF activity in vitro . Genetic or pharmacological interference with Abl ( and the related kinase Arg ) resulted in a marked decrease in Rac activation induced by physiological doses of growth factors . Thus , our data identify the molecular connections of a pathway RTKs – Abl – Sos - 1 – Rac that is involved in signal transduction and actin remodelling . The non - receptor tyrosine kinase Abl has been implicated in actin remodelling 1 – 3 . In particular , there is a strict relationship between Abl and the small GTPase Rac , as shown by findings that an oncogenic form of Abl , v - Abl , can activate Rac - dependent pinocytosis 4 , a process associated with actin re - arrangement . In addition , cells transformed by activated BCR - Abl oncoproteins , which are the result of balanced chromosomal translocations in leukaemia 5 , display a Rac - dependent increase in motility 6 . Finally , a dominant - negative Rac mutant inhibits BCR - Abl - induced leukaemic transformation 6 . Thus , Rac seems to function downstream of Abl and to be activated by it . Similarly to all GTPases , Rac cycles between inactive GDP - bound and active GTP - bound states . In vivo , Rac activation is regulated mainly by GEFs 7 . In turn , GEFs are subjected to multiple levels of reg - ulation , including phosphorylation 8 on both serine / threonine , as in the case of Tiam1 ( ref . 9 ) , and on tyrosine , as in the cases of Vav and Ras - GRF1 ( refs 10 – 12 ) . Thus , one attractive possibility is that the kinase activity of Abl regulates Rac by activating a Rac - specific GEF . Sos - 1 represents a suitable candidate for such a role . Sos - 1 is a dual GEF for Ras and Rac . It functions as a Rac - GEF when engaged in a complex with Eps8 and Abi1 ( also called E3b1 ) 13 . Moreover , Sos - 1 has been recently implicated in integrin - dependent proliferation through regulation of Rac activity 14 , a process in which Abl might also have an important role 15 . In anti - Sos - 1 immunoprecipitates from epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) - treated or platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF - BB ) - treated cells , a phosphotyrosine ( pY ) - containing band that comigrated with Sos - 1 was detected ( Fig . 1a ) . This band could represent tyrosine - phos - phorylated Sos - 1 or a pY - containing , co - immunoprecipitating pro - tein . To rule out the latter possibility , we used anti - epitope tag antibodies to immunoprecipitate ectopically expressed haemagglu - tinin ( HA ) - tagged and green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) - tagged Sos - 1 , which display different electrophoretic mobilities ( Fig . 1b ) . PY - con - taining bands that co - migrated with the tagged forms of Sos - 1 were detected ( Fig . 1b ) . In addition , no pY - containing bands were precipi - tated with anti - Sos - 1 antibodies in Sos - 1 null cells ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1a ) , and a truncated mutant of Sos - 1 encompass - ing the first 600 amino acids could also be tyrosine phosphorylated ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1b ) . A carboxy - terminally truncated EGF receptor mutant ( EGFR - c1022 ( refs 16 , 17 ) , with a faster electrophoretic mobility ) was expressed in EGFR - negative B82L cells . After stimulation with EGF , anti - Sos1 immunoprecipitates con - tained a readily detectable pY - containing protein that co - migrated with authentic Sos - 1 ( Fig . 1c ) , and was distinct from the autophos - phorylated , co - immunoprecipitated truncated receptor . Sos - 1 can be phosphorylated after activation of the EGFR kinase , either directly or indirectly . In the latter case , a probable candidate is the Abl kinase , which is activated by RTKs 1 and binds to the Sos - 1 interactor Abi1 / E3b1 ( refs 18 , 19 ) . Treatment of EGF - stimulated B82L - c1022 cells with STI571 , a specific Abl inhibitor , reduced phos - phorylation of Sos - 1 but did not alter tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR - c1022 ( Fig . 1c ) or several pY - containing proteins ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1c ) . The specificity of STI571 for Abl - mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Sos - 1 was confirmed with an Abl mutant that is resistant to the inhibitory effect of the drug ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1d ) . 1 Department of Experimental Oncology , European Institute of Oncology , Via Ripamonti , 435 , 20141 Milan , Italy . 2 IFOM , The FIRC Institute for Molecular Oncology , 20134 Milan , Italy . 3 Dipartimento di Medicina Chirurgia ed Ondontoiatria , Università degli Studi di Milano , 20122 Milan , Italy . 4 Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry , Yale University , SHMC - E31 333 Cedar Street , New Haven , CT 06510 , USA . 5 Correspondence should be addressed to G .

S2a ) . In addition , ectopically expressed ( Fig . 1e ) or endogenous ( Fig . 1f ) Abl and Sos - 1 associated in vivo in co - immunoprecipitation exper - iments . Binding between purified Abl and Sos - 1 was detected , indicat - ing that this interaction is , at least in part , direct ( Fig . 1g ) . Finally , the association was constitutive and not modulated by growth factors ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S2b ) . These results lead to the prediction that any active Abl kinase would cause tyrosine phosphorylation of Sos - 1 in vivo . In the absence of stimu - latory events , wild - type Abl displays a weak kinase activity 20 . In contrast , a mutant Abl lacking the auto - regulatory SH3 domain is constitutively active 21 , 22 . Consistently , pY - Sos - 1 was detected after transfection of ∆ SH3 - Abl , but was weakly tyrosine phosphorylated by wild - type Abl ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . 2c ) . Notably , Sos - 1 and ∆ SH3 - Abl could also be co - immunoprecipitated ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S2c ) . Moreover , recombinant constitutively active v - Abl could phosphorylate purified Sos - 1 in vitro in an ATP - dependent manner with a stoichiometry comparable with that of the Abl substrate , Crk ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S2d ) . Taken together , these results suggest that a signalling pathway activated by RTKs and reliant on Abl as a distal kinase is responsible for Sos - 1 tyrosine phosphoryla - tion in vivo . Sos - 1 has dual GEF activity for Ras and Rac . To determine the phys - iological significance of Sos - 1 tyrosine phosphorylation , we analysed how this modification affects its enzymatic abilities . Thus , purified preparations of Sos - 1 from mammalian cells were obtained . HA – Sos - 1 was expressed in 293T cells in the absence or presence of ∆ SH3 - Abl and then purified by two - step affinity chromatography ( see Methods and Supplementary Information , Fig . S3a , b ) , resulting in > 99 % pure preparations of Sos - 1 ( Fig . 2a ) . Sos - 1 purified from HA – Sos - 1 - trans - fected cells ( denoted as ‘Sos’ ) did not display any pY , whereas Sos - 1 purified from HA – Sos - 1 / ∆ SH3 - Abl transfectants ( denoted as Sos - P ) was tyrosine phosphorylated ( Fig . 2b ) . Approximately 20 % of the Sos - 1 molecules in the Sos - P preparation contained pY ( data not shown ) . a d e f g b c − + − + − + − + − + − + − + − − + + − + − + − − + + − + − + − + − + IP : IP : IP : IP : IP : Sos - 1 pY Blot : anti EGF PDGF IP : HA IP : GFP IP : HA IP : GFP EGF 205 - IP : pY Sos - 1 IP : EGF STI571 Sos - 1 - EGFR - c - 1022 Blot : anti EGF − + − + Abl / Arg − / − Abl reconst . pY Sos - 1 Sos - 1 Abl Abl B l o t : a n t i - B l o t : a n t i - B l o t : a n t i - Sos - 1 Abl Lys Lys Ctr Abl Lys Abl Sos - 1 Ctr Ctr 10 % HA − Sos - 1 205 - 97 - Coomassie Sos Abl Bound M r ( K ) M r ( K ) Blot : anti - Sosl Anti - pY Figure 1 RTK activation induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Sos - 1 in an Abl - dependent manner .

Ten per cent of the input Abl ( 10 % ) and all of the bound material ( bound ) was resolved by SDS – PAGE and stained with Coomassie . print ncb1096 13 / 2 / 04 3 : 48 PM Page 269 © 2004 Nature PublishingGroup © 2004 Nature PublishingGroup L E T T E R S 270 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 6 | NUMBER 3 | MARCH 2004 Notably , the Sos - P preparation contained no known Sos - 1 interactors ( Fig . 2b ) . To demonstrate that the pY band was Sos - 1 , the Sos - P prepa - ration was subjected to size - exclusion chromatography . A single species that reacted equally with anti - Sos - 1 or anti - pY eluted at approximately 200K , in agreement with the predicted molecular weight of Sos - 1 ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . 3c ) . Next , the Ras - and Rac - specific GEF activities of the Sos and Sos - P preparations were tested . Both Sos and Sos - P displayed Ras - GEF activ - ity ( Fig . 2c ) . However , Rac - GEF activity was only detected in the Sos - P sample , suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of Sos - 1 activates its Rac - GEF activity ( Fig . 2d ) . Furthermore , a catalytically inactive Rac - GEF mutant of Sos - 1 ( ref . 23 ) that was partially purified through sin - gle - step affinity chromatography had equal levels of pY when compared with wild type Sos - 1 ( Fig . 2e ) , and showed Ras - GEF , but not Rac - GEF , activity ( Fig . 2f ) . Thus , the Rac - GEF activity detected in the Sos - P preparation is caused by Sos - 1 , and not a contaminating GEF . These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of Sos - 1 acti - vates its Rac - GEF activity . Next , we formally proved that tyrosine phosphorylation activates Sos - 1 as a GEF for Rac : first , treatment with alkaline phosphatase dephosphorylated Sos - P and abrogated its Rac - GEF , but not its Ras - GEF , activity ( Fig . 3a ) ; second , treatment with the specific T - cell protein tyrosine phosphatase ( TP ) also caused dephos - phorylation of Sos - P and abrogation of its Rac - GEF activity ( Fig . 3b ) , but not its Ras - GEF activity ( data not shown ) ; third , immunodeple - tion of phosphorylated Sos - 1 with an anti - pY antibody resulted in the disappearance of the Rac - GEF activity from Sos - P ( Fig . 3c ) .

These results delineate a pathway RTK → Abl → pY - Sos1 → active Rac . Such a pathway could be indispensable for Rac activation by growth factors or redundant with other pathways . In previous studies , ruffling in response to PDGF was diminished , but not abrogated , in Abl null fibroblasts . This suggests that Abl participates in , but is not essential for , Rac activation associated with membrane ruffling 1 . We re - exam - ined this issue in double Abl / Arg knockout fibroblasts . Arg is closely related to Abl , and the functions of the two kinases are , at least in part , overlapping 2 . The levels of Rac - GTP and ruffling activity ( which depends on Rac activation ) were determined after PDGF - BB treat - ment . At low PDGF - BB concentrations , the double - knockout fibrob - lasts did not show significant responses , whereas re - introduction of Abl in these cells restored the expected concentration - dependent increase in Rac - GTP levels and ruffling activity ( Fig . 4 ) . Ruffling activ - ity could be detected in double - knockout fibroblasts only at high supra - physiological levels of the growth factor ( Fig . 4a , b ) . Similarly , significant levels of Rac - GTP were detectable in the double - knockout cells only at high doses of PDGF - BB ( Fig . 4b , c ) . The above results demonstrate that Abl / Arg activity is indispensable for PDGFR - dependent Rac activation at physiological levels of stimu - lation . The low levels of EGFR expressed by knockout fibroblasts pre - vented the collection of meaningful data for this RTK . To circumvent this problem , Cos - 7 cells were used in combination with STI571 treat - ment . Cos - 7 cells promptly and efficiently formed ruffles in response to EGF ( Fig . 4d ) . Pre - treatment of quiescent Cos - 7 cells with STI571 significantly reduced ruffling and Rac - GTP levels induced by high doses of EGF , and completely abrogated these responses at physiologi - cal concentrations of the growth factor ( Fig . 4d , e ) . Of note , Rac acti - vation and ruffling induced by high doses of EGF could be completely abolished only when cells were simultaneously treated with STI571 and wortmannin ( an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol - 3 - OH kinase ( PI ( 3 ) K ) ) , whereas neither inhibitor alone could do so completely ( Fig . 4d , f ) . Thus , at least two independent pathways respond to Rac activation at high levels of receptor stimulation . This contention is fur - ther supported by the finding that the EGF - dependent activation of PI ( 3 ) K , measured by phosphorylated AKT ( a known PI ( 3 ) K target ) , was unaffected by treatment with STI571 , but completely abrogated by Rac - GEF 30 20 10 0 G D P r e l ea s e d ( % ) 30 40 20 10 0 G D P r e l ea s e d ( % ) 30 40 20 10 0 G D P r e l ea s e d ( % ) Ras - GEF 40 50 30 20 10 0 G D P r e l ea s e d ( % ) + − BSA + − BSA + − Sos - P + − Sos - P + − Sos APi + − + − + − BSA + − Sos - P + − Sos Sos Sos - P + − Sos - P ID APi APi pY Sos - 1 B l o t : a n t i - B l o t : a n t i - B l o t : a n t i - TPi TPi pY Sos - 1 Buffer Ctr pY ID : Ctr pY pY Sos - 1 a b c Figure 3 Tyrosine phosphorylation is required to elicit the Rac - specific GEF activity of Sos - 1 .

The additional observation that STI571 treat - ment was completely ineffective on membrane ruffles induced by Ras G12V or Rac Q61L ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S4a ) indi - cates that the Abl kinase is not essential downstream of these GTPase ( as its F - and G - actin - binding capability might have suggested ) . This further supports a role for Abl in the activation of Rac and Rac - dependent phenotypes outside of the Ras pathways . In summary , we demonstrate that Sos - 1 is a substrate of the Abl kinase and that its tyrosine phosphorylation is sufficient for activation of its Rac - GEF activity . Thus , the tyrosine kinase - GTPase cascade RTK → Abl → pY - Sos - 1 → Rac is critical for Rac activation and Rac - induced phenotypes , and is independent of the canonical Ras pathway . The Rac - specific GEF activity of Sos - 1 is regulated by multiple mecha - nisms . In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation , we have shown previ - ously that assembly of Sos - 1 into a macromolecular complex including Eps8 and Abi1 is a prerequisite for activation of its exchange activity 13 . Complex formation is also essential for RTK - dependent Rac activa - tion , as demonstrated by the lack of RTK - dependent Rac signalling in the absence of Eps8 ( ref . 13 ) . This latter phenotype is similar to that observed in Abl / Arg knockout fibroblasts , suggesting that both the for - mation of an Eps8 – Abi1 – Sos - 1 complex and Abl - mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Sos - 1 are required in vivo to activate its Rac - GEF activity . How these two events are integrated towards the regulation of Sos - 1 activity remains to be established . One obvious possibility is that they both respond redundantly to optimal regulation of Sos - 1 Rac - GEF activity . This view is supported by the observation that Abi1 , which holds Eps8 and Sos - 1 together , is also capable of binding and regulating Abl kinase activity ( ref . 24 , and P . S . and G . S . , unpublished observations ) . This suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation of Sos - 1 may be favoured in the context of the trimeric complex , thereby con - tributing to the activation of its Rac - GEF . METHODS Expression vectors , antibodies and chemicals . All eukaryotic expression vec - tors were generated in cytomegalovirus - promoter - based constructs ( pCDNA3 , pCR3 ; Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) and sequences were verified . PMT2 - HA - Sos - 1 was a gift of D . Bar - Sagi ( State University of New York at Stony Brook , Stony brook , NY ) . GST – Ras and GST – Rac have been described previously 13 . The vec - tor encoding GST – Crk ( 120 – 225 ) was engineered in a pGEX - KT plasmid by cloning the appropriate fragment ( obtained by recombinant PCR ) in - frame with GST . The following antibodies were used : rabbit polyclonals anti - Sos - 1 and anti - Abl ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) , anti - AKT and anti - phospho - AKT ( Ser 473 ) ( Cell Signaling Technology , Beverly , MA ) , anti - EGFR ( Ab - 6 ; Oncogene Science , Cambridge , MA ) , polyclonal anti - Eps8 ( ref . 25 ) and anti - E3b1 sera ( ref . 26 ) , monoclonal anti - HA ( 12CA5 ; Covance , Princeton , NJ ) , anti - phosphotyrosine ( Upstate Biotechnology , Lake Placid , NJ ) , anti - v - H - Ras ( Oncogene Science ) and anti - Rac1 ( Transduction laboratories , Lexington , KY ) . We also tested the specificity of the anti - Sos - 1 and anti - Abl antibodies , and found no cross - reaction ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S4b ) . Wortmannin and sodium orthovanadate were from Sigma - Aldrich ( St Louis , MO ) . STI571 was from E . Buchdunger ( Novartis Pharma AG , Basel , Switzerland ) . Alkaline phosphatase was from Calbiochem ( San Diego , CA ) ; T - Cell protein tyrosine phosphatase from New England BioLabs ( Beverly , MA ) . Abl protein tyrosine kinase ( v - Abl ) was from Cell Signaling Technology ( Beverly , MA ) . Biochemical and functional assays . Immunoprecipitation and co - immunopre - cipitation were performed as described 25 . Wherever indicated , treatment was performed with EGF or PDGF - BB after serum starvation . Briefly , cells were lysed on ice with buffer containing 1 % Triton X - 100 , 50 mM Hepes at pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM sodium chloride , 5 mM EGTA , 1 . 5 mM magnesium chloride , 10 % glycerol , 0 . 1 mM sodium orthovanadate , 2 mM phenylmethylphosphate fluo - ride , 2 mM sodium pyrophosphate , 10 µ g ml − 1 aprotinin and 10 µ g ml − 1 leu - peptin . Immunoprecipitations were performed for 2 h at 4 ° C , and immunocomplexes were recovered by adsorption to protein A – Sepharose . After several washes with buffer containing 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , 50 mM Hepes at pH 7 . 5 , 10 % glycerol and 150 mM sodium chloride , immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS – PAGE and analysed by immunoblotting . In vitro GEF activity toward Ras or Rac was performed as described 13 . Data are averages ( with standard deviations ) of at least three independent experi - ments performed in triplicate . Results are expressed as 3 H - GDP released after 20 min relative to time zero . Control reactions were obtained by incubating 3 H - GDP - loaded Rac either in exchange buffer or in the presence of the non - related protein , bovine serum album ( BSA ) . The in vitro kinase assay was performed essentially as described 27 . In brief , kinase assay mixtures contained 0 . 7 mM recombinant Abl kinase ( v - Abl ; Calbiochem ) , 25 mM Tris at pH 7 . 25 , 100 mM sodium chloride , 5 mM man - ganese chloride , 1 mM dithiothreitol , 5 % glycerol , 100 ng of bovine serum albumin per ml , and 1 µ M sodium orthovanadate . After a 5 - min pre - incuba - tion at 30 ° C , 25 - µ l reactions were initiated by addition of 500 nM Sos - 1 / GST – Crk II and 5 µ M ATP . Reactions were terminated by addition of ice - cold SDS sample buffer and resolved by SDS – PAGE , before immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies . Sos - 1 and Sos - 1 - P purification . For Sos - 1 purification , total cell lysates from 293T cells transfected with HA – Sos - 1 were subjected to a two - step procedure . Initially , total cellular lysates were immunopurified on a HA - affinity column obtained by cross - linking anti - HA antibodies to immobilized protein G with dimethyl pimelidate dihydrochloride ( DMP , Pierce , Rockford , IL ) . After bind - ing , the column was washed with 20 bed volumes of lysis buffer containing 0 . 2 % SDS . Bound Sos - 1 was eluted with the peptide MYDVPDYAS , correspon - ding to the HA epitope tag ( see also Supplementary Fig . S3a , b ) . Next , the eluted HA – Sos - 1 was loaded onto an affinity column obtained by coupling the N - terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 to glutathione – Sepharose . The column was washed with 20 bed volumes of a buffer containing Tris - HCl at pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 15 M sodium chloride and 0 . 5 mM EGTA , before being eluted by the addition of the proline - rich C - terminal tail of Sos - 1 ( ref . 28 ) in Tris - HCl at pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 5 M sodium chloride and 0 . 5 mM EGTA . Finally , the preparation was dialysed against GEF buffer ( 25 mM Tris - HCl at pH 7 . 6 , 100 mM sodium chloride , 1 mM magnesium chloride , 1 mg ml − 1 BSA and 2 mM DTT ) and concentrated in Centricon YM - 50 ( Millipore , Billerica , MA ) with a cut - off of 50K , allowing purification from the C - terminal tail of Sos - 1 . To obtain Sos - P , HA - Sos - 1 and activated Abl were cotransfected in 293T cells and total cell lysates were subjected to the two - step purification described above . The final preparations ( both Sos and Sos - P ) were > 99 % pure , as assessed the percentage of Sos - 1 in relation to total protein . This was deter - mined by subjecting serial dilutions of the purified material to SDS – PAGE and Coomassie staining , and then comparing with a standard curve of BSA . Similar results were obtained by comparing the intensity of the band corre - sponding to Sos - 1 with the bands corresponding to contaminants and / or to Sos - 1 degradation products . For gel filtration , double - affinity purified Sos - P was loaded on a 25 - ml Superdex 200 size - exclusion chromatography equilibrated in 25 mM Tris - HCl at pH 7 . 6 , 100 mM sodium chloride , 10 mM magnesium chloride , 0 . 1 mM EGTA and 5 % glycerol . Aliquots of each fraction were resolved by SDS – PAGE and analysed by immunoblotting . Sos - P eluted at an apparent molecular weight of approximately 200K , as judged by comparison with the elution profile of molecular weight standards . Transfection procedures and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy . Fibroblasts were seeded on gelatin and transfected with the indicated expres - sions vectors , using Lipofectamine ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufac - turer’s instructions , and then serum - starved for 18 h in the presence of 10 µ M STI571 . Alternatively , Abl / Arg − / − cells ( ref . 2 ) , and their control cells in which c - Abl was ectopically re - expressed , were serum - starved for 24 h and then stimu - lated with various amounts of PDGF - BB . COS - 7 cells were serum - starved for 24 h and then cultured in the presence or absence of 100 nM wortmannin and / or 10 µ M STI571 for 2 h before stimula - tion with EFG 100 ng ml − 1 or 3 ng ml − 1 , as indicated . Cells were fixed in 4 % paraformaldheyde for 10 min , permeabilized in 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 and 2 % BSA for 10 min , blocked with 2 % BSA for 30 min , and then incubated with primary print ncb1096 13 / 2 / 04 3 : 48 PM Page 273 © 2004 Nature PublishingGroup © 2004 Nature PublishingGroup L E T T E R S 274 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 6 | NUMBER 3 | MARCH 2004 and secondary antibodies for 45 and 30 min , respectively .

NATURE . COM / NATURECELLBIOLOGY 1 Figure S1 . A . No pY - containing band comigrates with Sos - 1 in Sos - 1 immunocomplexes obtained from PDGF - stimulated Sos - 1 null cells . Sos - 1 null fibroblasts were transfected with empty vector ( - / - ) , as a control , or Sos - 1 ( - / - Sos - 1 ) . Cells were treated with PDGF - BB ( + ) or mock - treated ( - ) . Total cellular lysates ( 5 mg ) were immunoprecipitated with anti - Sos - 1 ( IP - Sos - 1 ) followed by immunoblotting ( WB ) with the indicated Abs . The pY - band , corresponding to Sos - 1 , was resistant to washes of the immunoprecipitates in SDS , up to 0 . 5 % ( not shown ) . B . Sos - 1 tyrosine phosphorylation sites are located in the first 600 n - terminal amino acids . 293T cells were transfected with untagged - Sos - 1 ( Sos - 1 ) , or HA - tagged Sos - 1 ( HASos - 1 ) , or with deletion mutants of Sos - 1 ( amino acid boundary and epitope tags are indicated ) . In all cases , cells were cotransfected with ∆ SH3 - Abl . Total cellular lysates ( 1 mg ) were immunoprecipitated ( IP ) with the appropriate Abs , indicated at the bottom . Immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS - PAGE and stained with Coomassie or immunoblotted ( WB ) with the indicated Abs . The anti - Sos - 1 Ab used was raised against the C - terminal proline rich region of Sos - 1 . C . STI571 does not significantly reduce the overall levels of protein tyrosine phosphorylation induced by EGF treatment . Quiescent B82L - c1022 cells were incubated in the presence ( STI571 : + ) or absence ( STI571 : - ) of STI571 for 2h and then treated with EGF ( + ) or mock treated ( - ) for 5 minutes . Total cellular lysates ( 50 µ g ) were immunoblotted ( WB ) with anti - pY with the indicated Abs ( WB ) . The overall tyrosine phosphorylation levels were not significantly reduced by treatment with STI571 , which abrogated Sos - 1 pTyr in Sos - 1 immunoprecipitates obtained from the same lysates and shown in Fig . 1C of the main text . The presence of EGFR - c1022 ( in panel of Fig . 1C ) , but not of endogenous EGFR ( panels A , B of Fig 1C ) in Sos - 1 immunocomplexes is due to the high levels of expression of EGFR - c1022 mutant ( ~ 4 x 10 6 receptors / cell ) with respect to those of endogenous EGFR present in Cos - 7 cells ( ~ 5 x 10 4 receptors / cell ) ( not shown ) . STI571 completely abrogated EGF - induced Abl activation as determined by immunocomplex kinase assays using GST - CRK2 as a substrate ( not shown ) . D . STI571 does not inhibit Sos - 1 tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by a STI571 - resistent BCR - ABL mutant . Cos7 cells were trasfected ( Tfx ) with HA - Sos - 1 together with either BCR - Abl or a mutant , BCR - AblG255L , which is insensitive to the action of STI571 . Transfectants were treated with STI571 for 2h ( + ) or mock treated ( - ) . Total cellular lysates ( Lysates ) and Sos - 1 immunoprecipitates ( IP Sos - 1 ) were immunoblotted with the indicated abs ( WB ) . © 2004 Nature PublishingGroup S U P P L E M E N TA R Y I N F O R M AT I O N 2 WWW . NATURE . COM / NATURECELLBIOLOGY Figure S2 . A . Abl / Arg - / - cells display comparable levels of PDGFRs and no detectable difference in PDGF - dependent activation of Ras , MAPK and AKT . Left panels , Abl / Arg - / - fibroblasts and their control cells , in which c - Abl expression was reconstituted ( Abl reconst . ) , were serum starved and subsequently treated with 30 ng / mlof PDGF - BB ( + ) or mock treated ( - ) . Total cellular lysates ( 50 µ g ) were immunoblotted with the Abs indicated on the left . Similar levels of PDGFRs were present in the two cell types . On the contrary , pY - Sos - 1 , detected in Sos - 1 IP obtained form the same cell lysates , and shown in Fig . 1D of the main text , was significantly reduced in Abl / Arg - / - cells as compared to Abl - reconstituted cells . Right panel quiescent Abl / Arg - / - fibroblast and their control cells , in which c - Abl expression was reconstituted ( Abl reconst . ) were treated with thee indicated concentration of PDGF - BB for 5 min . Total cellular lysates ( 50 µ g ) were directly immunoblotted with the abs against total MAPK and AKT , their respective phosphorylated forms ( pMAPK , and pAKT ) , and total Ras ( Ras ) , or incubated with the Ras binding domain of Raf ( RasGTP ) followed by immunoblotting with anti - Ras ab . B . EGF stimulation of Cos - 7 cells does not alter the association of Abl with Sos - 1 . Cos - 7 cells co - trasfected with Ha - Sos - 1 and Abl , were serum starved and treated with EGF ( + ) or mock treated ( - ) for 10 min . Total cellular lysates ( 1 mg ) were immunoprecipitated with anti - Sos - 1 or an irrelevant Ab ( ctr ) as a control . Lysates ( 50 µ g ) and immunoprecipitates ( IP ) were immunoblotted ( WB ) with the indicated Abs . C . An activated ∆ SH3Abl binds to and phosphorylates Sos - 1 . Total cellular lysates ( 1 mg ) from 293T cells , transfected ( Tfx ) with a combination of Sos - 1 ( + ) and either c - Abl ( + ) or ∆ SH3Abl ( + ) or the corresponding empty vector ( - ) , were IP with either anti - Sos - 1 or an irrelevant antibody ( ctr ) , followed by immunoblotting with the indicated Abs ( WB ) . The lanes labeled “Lys” were loaded with 50 µ g of total cellular proteins . D . Equal molar amounts of purified Sos - 1 prepared as described in Material and Methods and shown in supplementary Fig . 3A , or GST - CRK ( CRK ) were incubated either with recombinant v - Abl ( Calbiochem ) in the presence ( + ) or absence of ATP ( - ) ( left panels ) , or with ATP in the presence ( - ) or absence ( + ) of v - Abl ( right panels ) , and subjected to an in vitro kinase assay , as described in Materials and Methods .

First - step of the affinity purification of HA - Sos - 1 and HA - Sos - 1 - P . Sos and Sos - P were purified to homogeneity by a two - step affinity chromatography ( anti - HA followed by Grb - 2 - SH3 ) , as described in Materials and Methods . This yielded > 99 % pure preparations , shown in Fig . 2A of the main text . In this supplementary information , the degree of purity of the Sos and Sos - P preparations after the first affinity purification step ( anti - HA immuno - chromatography ) is shown . The shown preparations were obtained by incubating total cellular lysates with anti - HA Ab covalently linked to agarose beads , followed by washes with 25 mM Tris / HCl , 0 . 5 mM NaCl and elution in the same buffer containing a 1000 - fold molar excess of the HA antigenic peptide . By Coomassie staining ( A ) , the preparations appear to be > 85 % pure ( see also Materials and Methods for quantitations ) . However , contaminants , physically associating with Sos - 1 ( Abl is shown ) could still be detected by immunoblot ( B ) . These contaminants were totally eliminated from the final preparations by modifying the washing of the anti - HA column ( lysis buffer plus 0 . 2 % SDS , instead of 25 mM Tris / HCl , 0 . 5 mM NaCl ) , and adding a second affinity purification step onto immobilized Grb2 - SH2 , as described in Materials and Methods ( see also Fig . 2A of the main text ) . The preparations shown here were used for the experiments shown in Fig . 1H and 3 of the main text , while for all other experiments the > 99 % pure preparations ( shown in Fig . 2A of the main text ) were used . C . Gel - filtration chromatography of Sos - 1 - P . Purified Sos - P ( as from Fig . 2A of the main text ) was loaded onto a 25 ml Superdex 200 size - exclusion chromatography column , equilibrated in Tris / HCl 25 mM pH 7 . 6 , NaCl 100 mM , MgCl2 10 mM , EGTA 0 . 1 mM , glycerol 5 % . Aliquots of each fraction were resolved by SDS - PAGE and immunoblotted with the indicated Abs . Sos - P eluted at an apparent molecular weight of about 200 KDa , as judged by comparison with the elution profile of molecular weight standards . Bottom panels , fraction 9 , 10 and 11 were pooled and immunoprecipitated with anti - HA or an irrelevant Ab as a control ( ctr ) , followed by immunoblotting ( WB ) with the indicated Abs . © 2004 Nature PublishingGroup S U P P L E M E N TA R Y I N F O R M AT I O N 4 WWW .
