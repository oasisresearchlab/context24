Sheetz , ColumbiaUniversity , New York , NY , and accepted by theEditorial Board February 23 , 2010 ( received for review December15 , 2009 ) The interaction between cells and nanostructured materials is at - tracting increasing interest , because of the possibility to open up novel concepts for the design of smart nanobiomaterials with active biological functionalities . In this frame we investigated the response of human neuroblastoma cell line ( SH - SY5Y ) to gold surfaces with different levels of nanoroughness . To achieve a precise control of the nanoroughness with nanometer resolution , we exploited a wet chemistry approach based on spontaneous gal - vanic displacement reaction . We demonstrated that neurons sense and actively respond to the surface nanotopography , with a sur - prising sensitivity to variations of few nanometers . We showed that focal adhesion complexes , which allow cellular sensing , are strongly affected by nanostructured surfaces , leading to a marked decrease in cell adhesion . Moreover , cells adherent on nanorough surfaces exhibit loss of neuron polarity , Golgi apparatus fragmen - tation , nuclear condensation , and actin cytoskeleton that is not functionally organized . Apoptosis / necrosis assays established that nanoscale features induce cell death by necrosis , with a trend directly related to roughness values . Finally , by seeding SH - SY5Y cells onto micropatterned flat and nanorough gold surfaces , we de - monstrated the possibility to realize substrates with cytophilic or cytophobic behavior , simply by fine - tuning their surface topo - graphy at nanometer scale . Specific and functional adhesion of cells occurred only onto flat gold stripes , with a clear self - alignment of neurons , delivering a simple and elegant approach for the de - sign and development of biomaterials with precise nanostructure - triggered biological responses . nanobiointeractions ∣ nanostructures ∣ patterning T he potential of nanomaterials to trigger specific cellular re - sponses , such as interference and / or activation of defined pathways ( 1 – 3 ) , is promising for the development of many impor - tant scientific fields , such as regenerative medicine , biotechnol - ogy , drug delivery , and nanotoxicity assessment . Initially , cells – materials interactions were tackled only from a chemical point of view , because environmental sensing by cells involves specific binding between cellular receptors and ECM ligands . However , recently there has been increasing evidence that the biological response is also affected by the physical properties of the material ( 4 ) . In particular , it has been demonstrated that cells are influ - enced by the substrate topography ( 5 , 6 ) , rigidity ( 7 , 8 ) , aniso - tropy ( 9 , 10 ) , surface charge ( 11 , 12 ) , and wettability ( 13 , 14 ) . From this perspective , cellular response to external stimuli goes far beyond the bare ability of the cell to chemically sense specific ECM ligands and includes a wide range of physical cues that are generated at , or act on , the interface between cells and the sur - rounding environment . For instance , it has been observed that micrometer - scale roughness may affect cell proliferation and morphology ( 15 , 16 ) , because it provides a quasi - biomimetic microenvironment to the cells . However , cell – substrate inter - actions are typically governed by complex mechanisms occurring at the nanoscale , which are generally referred to as nanobiointer - actions ( 17 ) . In fact , because the adhesion sites of the cell ( focal adhesions ) are in the range of 5 – 200 nm , it is clear that these very small cellular components may be strongly influenced by nano - scale features rather than microscale structures ( 18 ) . In this frame , nanofabrication techniques may offer interesting tools to achieve a precise control of the surface properties ( e . g . , con - trolled nanotexture ) and , thus , to evaluate the mechanisms and spatiotemporal aspects of nanomaterial interactions with living systems ( 19 – 23 ) . In this work , we investigated the biological response of human neuroblastoma cells ( SH - SY5Y ) upon inter - action with highly controlled nanostructured metal substrates . Neural cells are known to be strongly affected by the properties of culture substrates ( 24 ) . In particular , the SH - SY5Y cell line is a good model for neuronal differentiation and shows an integrin receptors pathway highly sensitive to environmental stimuli ( 25 , 26 ) . To evaluate the effects that surface nanoroughness may exert over these neuronal cells , we applied a wet chemistry technique , namely , spontaneous galvanic displacement reactions ( SGDR ) ( 27 ) that can allow an extremely precise control over the surface morphology . SGDR enabled us to reliably fabricate sur - face nanoscale features with accurate and controlled levels of sur - face nanoroughness , uniformly extended over wide areas . We demonstrated that nanostructured gold surfaces can modulate neurons behavior with a direct dependence on surface nanoroughness . Interestingly , such nanotopographies are able to trigger neuron adhesion / viability , with a surprising sensitivity of cells to nanometer - scale changes . Moreover , by combining SGDR processes with lithographic techniques ( 27 , 28 ) , we demonstrated the possibility to obtain two - dimensional micropat - terns of cytophilic / cytophobic surfaces , respectively presenting permissive or hostile signals for cell adhesion . This approach leads to a clear self - alignment of neuronal cells , simply by tuning the surface nanoscale features . Results and Discussion In what follows , we discuss how surface nanoroughness influences the biological response of neurons , namely , cell adhesion , mor - phology , differentiation , and , ultimately , cell survival . We studied SH - SY5Y cells as a model system for their particular sensitivity to environmental stimuli ( 25 , 26 ) and for the importance of func - tional biomaterials in neural research . To obtain a good control of surface topography , we exploited a wet chemistry approach ( SGDR ) ( 27 ) , achieving different nanorough gold surfaces ( Fig . 1 ) . By tuning the thickness of the initial sacrificial metal , we were able to obtain increasing values of surface roughness with nanometer control and appreciable uniformity . Fig . 1 depicts the atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) analyses of the nanostruc - tured surfaces employed for the cell growth . It is interesting to note the precise control of the surface nanoroughness , with the mean rough values ( R a ) increasing from ca . 36 nm of the first nanostructured sample ( Fig . 1 B ) to an R a value of 100 nm of the most rough substrate ( Fig . 1 F ) . On the other hand , the reference flat Au surface exhibits an R a value less than 1 nm ( Fig . 1 A ) . AFM Author contributions : V . B . and P . P . P . designed research ; V . B . , G . M . , L .

All these gold substrates were chemically modified with cysteine coating to provide a “ biologically friendly ” surface for cells . In the early moments of cell contact with substrates , pro - teins in the medium adsorb onto material surfaces ( 16 ) , mediat - ing the subsequent cellular events such as adhesion , proliferation , and differentiation ( 29 ) . Cysteine - functionalized substrates exhi - bit a marked hydrophilic character , which raises with the increase of R a ( 28 ) . The first investigation was directed to estimate cell adhesion onto the different nanotopographies . Fig . 2 A reveals a significant decrease of cell attachment on the nanostructured substrates , directly related to the nanoroughness level . Interest - ingly , small differences in R a ( even a few nanometers ) are clearly sensed by the cells that exhibit different adhesion capability . At the highest value of R a ( 80 – 100 nm ) , we observed a dramatic decrease of cell adhesion , down to about 10 – 15 % of the control flat substrate . A further investigation aimed to explore cell fate after interaction and adhesion onto such nanotopographies . We performed a test capable to distinguish between apoptotic and necrotic cells , on the basis of in vivo staining with FITC - conju - gated annexinV and propidium iodide ( PI ) . Fig . 2 B elucidates the dependence of cell fate as a function of nanoroughness . It is possible to note that substrate nanostructuration , besides hindering cell adhesion , strongly elicits necrosis processes in SH - SY5Y cells , with a trend directly related to the R a value . Noteworthy , even in the substrate with the minimal R a value ( 36 nm ) , ca . 50 % of adherent cells undergo necrosis processes . Then , in the other more rough substrates , cell necrosis approaches 90 – 95 % . On the other hand , no pathways of pro - grammed cell death were induced by nanostructuration : Apoptotic cell percentage remains constant among the different nanorough substrates and similar to the value found on the con - trol surface . The investigated R a values are comparable with the dimension of protein complexes , so SH - SY5Y were influenced by the different nanobiointeractions that are generated at the interface between cell and nanostructuration . To investigate this cellular behavior , we performed confocal imaging of SH - SY5Y cells cultured for 24 h onto flat ( Fig . 3 A ) and nanorough sub - strates ( Fig . 3 B , substrate with R a value of 100 nm ) . As expected , flat gold surface allows specific cell adhesion , axonal autogrowth , and functional cytoskeletal orientation , whereas nuclei maintain their integrity , showing finely dispersed chromatin . On the other side , the few cells grown onto nanorough substrates showed a round shape , a tendency to form clusters , and a lack of specialized structures . The nucleus results condensed , and the filamentous actin structures were localized in the peripheral area of cytoplasm , suggesting that these cells are undergoing necrosis , in line with the findings of Fig . 2 B . To further understand the cell – nanostructure interactions , we investigated the cellular sensing machinery , namely , the focal adhesion points . Because such a dynamic complex mediates the adhesion - dependent recruitment of signaling molecules , which are essential for cell response to environmental stimuli ( 4 , 30 ) , we decided to explore the distribution and recruitment of vinculin , an ubiquitously expressed cytoskeletal protein ( 31 ) . SH - SY5Y cells cultured onto flat surfaces ( Fig . 4 A – B ) presented a clear pattern of adhesion complexes , identified as green spots ( vinculin aggregates ) that are mainly localized at the periphery of the cell , in connection with axonal growth . Such a protein is indeed associated in characteristic plaques during formation of focal adhesion complex ( 31 – 33 ) . Cells seeded onto rough substrates ( Fig . 4 C – D ) , conversely , showed a sporadic and not organized distribution of vinculin plaques . These results clearly support the concept that surface nanotopography affects cell Fig . 1 . AFM analysis of gold surfaces with increasing level of nanoroughness . The surface morphology shifts from a flat gold film ( A ) to uniformly nano - structured surface with different level of nanoroughness ( B – E ) . R a indicates the mean surface roughness , calculated on 40 × 40 μ m 2 regions . On the bottom of each substrate , representative line profiles are reported . Brunetti et al .

A possible contribution may be provided by the increasing hydrophilicity of the rough substrates ( 28 ) , which may affect the correct formation of the ECM layer onto the substrate . The observed cell response may be explained by the properties of nanorough surfaces to influence the adsorp - tion of cell adhesive serum proteins , such as fibronectin and laminin , in terms of composition and / or correct folding of the ad - sorbed protein layers . This class of proteins plays a critical role in neurons adhesion and growth ( 34 , 35 ) . An inappropriate protein coating formation onto nanorough surfaces may lead to inade - quate clustering of the right amount of integrins and thus to a poor and disorganized recruitment of vinculin , necessary for stable and mature focal adhesion complexes ( 36 ) . In this respect , we observed that the sensing cellular machinery of SH - SY5Y cells is not able to correctly interact with the nanorough substrates . As a result , the absence of functional focal adhesion points deprives neurons of survival integrin - mediated signaling and intracellular signaling of anchorage - dependent growth ( 29 , 37 ) . This evidence is in qualitative agreement with the necrosis processes observed in Figs . 2 B and 3 B . Another important point is the assessment of neuron function - ality in terms of their Golgi apparatus morphology . In fact , Golgi belongs to the organelles of the neuronal secretory pathway , with a crucial role for neuronal development as well as for the proper localization of plasma membrane proteins necessary for polarity , synaptic transmission , and plasticity ( 38 ) . Fig . 5 reports immuno - detection of Golgi complex by anti - golgin 97 antibody that recog - nizes the 97 kDa protein golgin - 97 , a peripheral membrane protein localized on the cytoplasmic face of the Golgi apparatus , that plays a critical role in vesicle traffic from the endosome to the trans - Golgi network ( 39 ) . SH - SY5Y cells cultured onto the flat surface ( Fig . 5 A – B ) exhibit a well - developed Golgi system , indi - cating a good cellular functionality . In particular , a wide network of distal Golgi vesicles for the entire length of axons is evident . Such structures are important during the phase of neuron growth , being involved in the trafficking of both integral membrane proteins and the secreted neuronal growth factors ( 38 ) . Such a well - distributed Golgi complex reinforces the evidence of fully developed and functional SH - SY5Y cells . On the other hand , cells seeded onto a nanorough surface ( Fig . 5 C – D ) have the ty - pical Golgi features of cells undergoing the necrosis process ( 40 ) , likely because of the extensive cytoplasmic damage associated to necrosis . In particular , Fig . 5 C – D depicts an inactive Golgi network , leaned against the nuclear membrane , with no evidence of polarity . These results show that cells cultured onto flat surfaces present a polarized organization of neuronal secretory trafficking and demonstrate a possible link between membrane trafficking and cellular nanotopography sensing . Finally , we demonstrated the possibility to control cell adhe - sion and proliferation onto micropatterned substrates with alter - nated flat and nanorough surfaces , showing that the control of such nanotopographies can guide substrates toward cytophilic or cytophobic behavior . In this respect , neurons cultured onto 100 μ m ( Fig . 6 A – C ) or 50 μ m ( Fig . 6 D ) of flat / nanorough pat - terned stripes show , in fact , selective growth onto the flat stripes , in close agreement with the results presented above . Therefore , by only varying the surface nanostructuration , neuronal cell adhesion and growth can be easily and precisely controlled . In particular , cells actively choosing flat surfaces present specific cell adhesion , axonal autogrowth , axonal pathfinding , and cytoskele - tal specific orientation , as elucidated by Fig . 6 , in which nuclei and actin cytoskeleton network are stained . This result shows that nanoscale features , alone , are able to control and guide SH - SY5Y cell adhesion , proliferation , and fate , opening an inter - esting perspective for efficient and functional neuron patterning . Conclusions Our results demonstrated that SH - SY5Y neuronal cells have a surprisingly high sensitivity to nanoscale features . The surface nanoroughness represents the main driving force that actively in - fluences adhesion , development , and functionality of SH - SY5Y cells . Adherent cells , focal adhesion points , cytoskeleton , Golgi organization , and morphology were investigated , revealing a striking difference between cells adhering onto nanorough sur - faces with respect to flat samples . The lack of organized focal ad - hesion points triggers a cascade of signaling processes that produces loss of neuron polarization and activity , by disruption of a coordinated regulation of membrane trafficking and of cytoskeletal dynamics , leading to necrosis . It is remarkable that also small values of surface nanoroughness are able to generate a massive biological response in terms of cell viability . An Fig . 2 .

In fact , in the micropatterned flat / nanorough gold surfaces , we observed cell adhesion and cytoskeletal specific orientation only in the smooth gold areas of the substrates , resulting in a clear self - align - ment of neuronal cells . These results were achieved simply by varying nanoscale features , combining lithographic techniques with a wet chemistry approach ( SGDR ) , without any complex strategy of biomolecule selective patterning . In conclusion , by properly controlling and managing the surface features , we were able to realize cytophilic or cytophobic surfaces , useful in the development of biomaterials for neural research , ranging from basic biological studies to tissue engineering . Materials and Methods Roughness - Controlled Gold Surfaces and Pattern Fabrication . To evaluate the effects of nanoscale features over cell behavior , we fabricated different sub - strates with increasing values of nanoroughness . For the preparation of sub - strates , glass slides ( 1 . 5 cm × 1 . 5 cm ) were first sonicated with ultrapure water for 10 min and then treated with a 1 ∶ 1 ∶ 5 solution of 30 % NH 3 OH ( J . T . Baker ) , 30 % H 2 O 2 ( J . T . Baker ) , and water at 75°C for 10 min , followed by treatment with a 1 ∶ 1 ∶ 5 solution of 30 % HCl ( J . T . Baker ) , 30 % H 2 O 2 , and water at 75°C for 10 min , with intermediate washing steps with deionized water after each treatment . Subsequently , the cleaned surfaces were reacted with 400 μ L of 1 % aminopropyltriethoxysilane ( APTES , Sigma - Aldrich ) aqueous solution for 5 min , washed with deionized water , and kept in vacuum overnight to remove the unbound APTES molecules . Such samples were coated with different thicknesses of Ag film , namely , 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 , and 50 nm , respectively , onto a predeposited 50 - nm - thick flat Au film ( 0 . 5 Å ∕ s evaporation rate ) . All these samples were then incubated , for the SGDR reaction , with the same HAuCl 4 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) aqueous solutions ( 10 − 3 M HAuCl 4 , 10 min of incubation at room temperature ) , followed by extensive washing in deionized water and 5 % vol ∕ vol NH 3 OH ( J . T . Baker ) for 10 min to remove the AgCl produced by the reaction and possibly adsorbed over the surface . In this way , by tuning the thickness of the initial sacrificial template for the SGDR process , we were able to conveniently tune the surface roughness , with nanometer control . A 50 - nm - thick flat Au film was used as the reference substrate for cells . To further evaluate cellular response to nanostructured surface topologies , we fabricated patterned flat / nanorough gold samples ( 27 ) . Cleaned APTES - modified substrates were first coated with a 50 - nm - thick flat Au film ( 0 . 5 Å ∕ s evaporation rate ) and then 100 - or 50 - μ m stripes mask of optical AZ® 9260 resist layers ( Nowell ) were defined on them , allowing the selective deposition of 50 - nm - thick Ag film only within the exposed regions of the gold film . After removing the resist with acetone , the patterned Au - Ag substrates were incubated for 10 min with 10 − 3 M HAuCl 4 aqueous solution for the SGDR reaction , so only the Ag stripes were replaced by gold ions . To allow optimal cell ad - hesion onto flat and nanorough substrates , all samples were subsequently functionalized with cysteine ( Sigma - Aldrich ) solution ( 10 − 3 M overnight un - der nitrogen atmosphere ) . Such thiol / Au chemistry allowed us to uniformly cover both flat and rough gold surfaces with a monolayer of such a small molecule ( 28 ) that creates a biologically friendly surface . The topography of the gold surfaces was characterized by AFM . All AFM experiments were performed in contact mode in air , using a Nanoscope IV MultiMode scanning probe microscopy ( Veeco Instruments ) under ambient conditions ( 20 – 25°C , atmospheric pressure , ∼ 50 % humidity ) . Ultrasharp silicon nitride AFM probes ( DNP - S series ; Veeco Instruments ) were used with a typical spring con - stant of 0 . 58 Nm − 1 and a normal tip radius of 10 nm . Several images were obtained from separate locations of the surfaces to ensure reproducibility . All the images were analyzed by using the NanoScope ™ software ( Digital Instruments , version 6 . 0 ) . Cell Culture . Flat and nanostructured gold surfaces were sterilized by immer - sion in absolute ethanol ( J . T . Baker ) for15 min and then dried in sterile hood . The SH - SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line was routinely seeded at densities of 1 × 10 5 cells ∕ cm 2 in high glucose ( 4 ; 500 mg ∕ L ) DMEM with 50 μ M glutamine ( Gibco ) , 1 mM sodium pyruvate ( Gibco ) , and 0 . 1 mM non - essential amino acids ( Gibco ) , supplemented with 10 % FBS , 100 U ∕ mL penicillin , and 100 mg ∕ mL streptomycin ( Invitrogen ) . Cells were incubated in a humidified controlled atmosphere with a 95 % to 5 % ratio of air ∕ CO 2 , at 37°C . Medium was changed every 3 days . Subconfluent cultures were split once per week , by using 1 × trypsin / EDTA ( Invitrogen ) . Confocal Microscopy for Adherent Cell Counting and for Apoptosis / Necrosis Assay . Counting of adherent SH - SY5Y cells onto flat and nanostructured sub - strates with an increasing level of nanoroughness was carried out by nuclei staining with Hoechst 33258 ( Fluka ) . Briefly , each substrate was seeded with 1 × 10 5 cells ∕ cm 2 . After24hofincubation , sampleswerewashedwithPBSpH 7 . 4 ( Sigma ) to remove floating cells . Adherent cells were fixed in buffered 3 . 7 % formaldehyde ( Sigma ) for 20 min , permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ( Sigma ) in PBS for 5 min , and subsequently incubated with 1 ng ∕ mL Hoechst in PBS for nuclei fluorescent characterization and counting . An annexinV - FITC apoptosis kit ( Sigma ) was used for a direct count of viable , apoptotic , and necrotic cells onto flat and nanorough substrates . After Fig . 4 .

For both adherent and apoptotic / necrotic cell counting , we acquired 10 random fields for each sample by a confocal microscope ( Leica TCS - SP5 AOBS ) . Samples were observed through a 20 × , 0 . 70 N . A . objective . For statistical analysis and reproducibility verification , each experiment was per - formed with four biological replicates . Confocal Microscopy for Cell Characterizations . SH - SY5Y cells , grown in the same conditions reported above , were fixed in formaldehyde , then permea - bilized in Triton X - 100 , and blocked in PBS , 1 % BSA , and 0 . 01 % sodium azide for 15 min . Primary antibodies incubation was carried out for 1 h at room temperature at a dilution of 1 ∶ 500 in blocking agent ; secondary antibodies incubation was performed at the same conditions , at a dilution 1 ∶ 1 ; 000 in blocking reagent . To detect focal adhesion points , Monoclonal Anti - Vinculin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and Donkey Anti - Mouse IgG DyLight 488 ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ) were used . To characterize morphology and polarity of the Golgi apparatus , anti - golgin 97 ( Molecular Probes ) and Donkey Anti - Mouse DyLight 649 ( Jackson ImmunoResearch ) were used . In both prepara - tions , nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 ( Fluka ) . For cells cultured onto micropatterned flat / nanorough gold surfaces , cytoskeleton morphology was investigated by phalloidin - TRITC ( Sigma ) labeling ( 1 μ g ∕ mL in PBS from 1 mg ∕ mL DMSO stock solution ) and nuclei by Hoechst 33258 staining . After washing , all samples were mounted with Fluoromount ( Sigma ) on a glass coverslip and characterized by confocal microscopy . Samples were observed through a 20 × , 0 . 70 N .
