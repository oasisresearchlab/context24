The actin subfamily Pt Act4 , out of many subfamilies , is differentially localized for speciﬁc local functions in Paramecium tetraurelia cells Ivonne M .

With monospeciﬁc antibodies against actin subfamily 4 members , we could label cleavage furrow , nascent food vacuoles , oral apparatus , cilia , cell surface and macronucleus . Expression as green ﬂuorescent protein - ( GFP - ) fusion protein now allowed us to localize more stringently actin4 , e . g . , in the macronucleus , particularly when enhanced with anti - GFP antibodies . Posttranscriptional gene silencing of actin4 resulted in disturbances at sites where actin4 has been localized . Cell division was impaired already early on , occasionally resulting in deformed cells . Both micro - and macronuclear development during vegetative cell ﬁssion were disturbed . Over longer periods , actin4 silencing entailed reduced phagocytotic activity , paralleled by accumulation of ‘‘acidosomes’’ ( late endosomes ) near the cytopharynx where they normally fuse with nascent phagosomes . In addition , near the cell surface , extensively misshapen ‘‘terminal cisternae’’ ( early endosomes ) occurred . In deformed cells , both constitutive endocytosis and stimulated trichocyst exocytosis were impaired . Thus , actin4 exerts pleiotropic effects at widely different sites of the Paramecium cell and disturbances generally coincide with sites where actin4 is normally enriched . Evidently the loss of actin4 cannot easily be compensated for by any other of the large number of actin isoforms occurring in a Paramecium cell . & 2010 Elsevier GmbH . All rights reserved . Introduction Actin is a highly conserved cytoskeletal protein present in all eukaryotic cells . Among others it is responsible for cell shape and stability , cell division , movement and contraction , organelle positioning and intracellular transport ( Goodson and Hawse , 2002 ; Lenart et al . , 2005 ; Robertson et al . , 2009 ; Soldati and Schliwa , 2006 ; Steigemann and Gerlich , 2009 ) . After a long - lasting debate ( Schleicher and Jockusch , 2008 ) actin has increasingly been found in the nucleus ‘‘as a general feature of eukaryotic life’’ ( Grummt , 2006 ) . In recent analyses we have found nine actin subfamilies with 25 paralogs in Paramecium tetraurelia ( Sehring et al . , 2007a , 2007b ) , Pt Act , with widely different localization . Subfamily members are rather similar and , therefore , probably have arisen by a recent whole genome duplication ( Aury et al . , 2006 ) , thus representing ‘‘ohnologs’’ . The P . tetraurelia actin4 subfamily comprises two isoforms / ohnologs . Pt Act4 - 1 and Pt Act4 - 2 have the same size ( 38 . 5 kDa ) and share 96 . 8 % sequence identity on amino acid level , while the macronuclear open reading frames , ORFs , of Ptact4 - 1 and Ptact4 - 2 share 90 . 8 % of their nucleotides ( Table 1 ) . Our recent immuno - localization studies have shown label around the oral cavity and nascent food vacuoles , in cilia and in the cell cortex as well in the cleavage furrow ( Sehring et al . , 2007a , 2007b ) which previously escaped detection by ﬂuorescent phalloidin ( Kersken et al . , 1986a , 1986b ) . However , previous examination of the subcellular localization of actin4 had only pilot - character in as much as it was confronted with technical problems . For instance , overexpression as a construct tagged with GFP at the N - terminus ( to avoid possible disturbance of polymerization ) was not possible , as cells did not divide after microinjection and were too unstable for ﬂuorescence micros - copy . Therefore , we now developed a C - terminal construct with a seven amino acids long spacer between actin4 and GFP . This construct was well tolerated by the cells . Additionally we analyzed the effects of actin4 silencing in much more detail , including electron microscopy ( EM ) , and on a ﬁner time scale . Most of the effects we now ﬁnd clearly relate to subcellular components to which actin4 is localized . This includes cell motility , exocytosis , endocytosis , phagosome processing , and , in addition , nuclear and cell division . P . tetraurelia possesses one vegetative , polyploid macronucleus ( (cid:2) 800 n ) and two diploid micronuclei which are responsible for the sexual rearrangement of the whole genome as a consequence ARTICLE IN PRESS Contents lists available at ScienceDirect journal homepage : www . elsevier . de / ejcb European Journal of Cell Biology 0171 - 9335 / $ - see front matter & 2010 Elsevier GmbH .

In contrast , the aspect analyzed here is vegetative binary ﬁssion whose stages are summarized in Fig . 1 . The whole phagosomal system in P . tetraurelia represents a complex membrane trafﬁcking system similar to phagosome systems in mammalian cells ( Allen and Fok , 2000 ) . Paramecium cells internalize microorganisms into food vacuoles arising at the cytopharynx , at the posterior part of the oral apparatus . Previous studies using actin - speciﬁc drugs have demonstrated the rele - vance of F - actin in this step in Paramecium ( Cohen et al . , 1984a ; Kersken et al . , 1986a , 1986b ) and Tetrahymena ( Zackroff and Hufnagel , 1998 , 2002 ) . However , according to localization studies ( Sehring et al . , 2007a , 2007b ) , some of the later steps of the digestive cycle may equally depend on actin , as outlined below . When the nascent digestive vacuole pinches off , acidosomes rapidly fuse with it ( Allen et al . , 1993 ; Allen and Fok , 1983 ) . Then , the phagosome is transported , depending on actin ( Allen and Fok , 1985 ; Cohen et al . , 1984a , 1984b ; Sehring et al . , 2007b ) , ﬁrst along a microtubular ﬁber system , called post - oral ﬁbers , and then , with unilaterally attached Pt Act1 isoforms ( Sehring et al . , 2007b ) , towards the posterior part and further inside the cell . In total at least 7 actin isoforms , including actin4 , may be involved in the process of phagosome progressing ( Sehring et al . , 2007b ) . Pt Act4 , together with some other isoforms , is also known to occur in cilia ( Sehring et al . , 2007b ) . Also in Paramecium , actin participates in the positioning of dense core - secretory vesicles ( Beisson and Rossignol , 1975 ) , called ‘‘trichocysts’’ . These cells also perform clathrin - based endocytosis via ‘‘parasomal sacs’’ , i . e . , equivalents of coated pits which are regularly arranged in rows at the plasma membrane . After pinching off and uncoating they fuse with early endosomes , called ‘‘terminal cisternae’’ ( Allen , 1988 ; Allen et al . , 1992 ; Allen and Fok , 2000 ; Fl¨otenmeyer et al . , 1999 ) . The role of actin in endocytosis in yeast and in mammalian cells has recently been reviewed ( Robertson et al . , 2009 ; Smythe and Ayscough , 2006 ) . At least in yeast cells , actin and actin - regulatory proteins can be found throughout all stages of the forming clathrin - coated vesicle . In yeast , actin is responsible for the internalization process in which polymerizing of actin ‘‘pushes’’ the vesicle away from the plasma membrane and initiates ﬁssion ( Aghamohammadzadeh and Ayscough , 2009 ; Robertson et al . , 2009 ) . Involvement of actin in the processing of phago ( lyso ) - somes , alias ‘‘food vacuoles’’ , is also well documented in Paramecium ( Allen and Fok , 1985 , 2000 ; Fok et al . , 1985 , 1987 ; Fok and Allen , 1993 ) , as it is in macrophages ( Liebl and Grifﬁths , 2009 ) . The highly regular structure of the Paramecium cell and the rather precisely deﬁned membrane trafﬁcking pathways ( Allen et al . , 1993 ; Allen and Fok , 2000 ; Fok and Allen , 1993 ; Plattner , 2002 ; Plattner and Kissmehl , 2003 ) in conjunction with the availability of complete genomic information ( Aury et al . , 2006 ) make these cells an attractive model to analyze the effects of silencing the actin genes . We here concentrate on actin4 because of its widely diversiﬁed topology and function in these cells . Our antibody against actin4 recognizes both ohnolog translation products . Similarly , Ptact4 silencing will concern both ohnologs , but it will be speciﬁc for the subfamily ( see ‘‘Results’’ ) . We – rightly – expected that this will affect the subcellular components containing actin4 . Materials and methods Stocks and cultures Experiments were carried out with the wildtype strains d4 - 2 and 7S of Paramecium tetraurelia , both derived from stock 51s . Cells were grown at 25 1 C in a decoction of dried lettuce , monoxenically inoculated with Enterobacter aerogenes as a food organism and supplemented with 0 . 4 m g / ml b - sitosterol , or at 27 1 C in an infusion of wheat grass powder ( Pines International Co . , Lawrence , KA ) inoculated with Klebsiella pneumoniae , also supplemented with 0 . 4 m g / ml b - sitosterol ( Sonneborn , 1970 ) . Construction of Green Fluorescent Protein ( GFP ) genes The ORF of Ptact4 - 1 was cloned from cDNA , using Spe I and Xho I , into the pPXV - eGFP vector previously described ( Hauser Table 1 Comparison of Ptact4 - 1 with the other Paramecium genes ( ORF base pairs [ bp ] ) and of the encoded actin and actin - related proteins ( arp ) .

To avoid possible interference with polymerization properties , actin4 was separated from GFP by a seven amino acid spacer . Oligonucleotides used for ampliﬁcation of actin4 - 1 were 5’Spe - Act4 - 1 , CGACTAGTATGAA - TAGCGATGAAATAATATCTGTCGTTGC , and 3’Xho - Act4 - 1 _ mut , CGCTCGAGATCCATTAGGACACTTTCTTTCTA . The stop codon was changed from TGA to TCC in order to avoid breakage of the polypeptide chain between actin4 , spacer and GFP . Transfection and visualization of PtAct4 - GFP Plasmid DNA for microinjection was prepared as described in Wassmer et al . ( 2005 ) . All cells used for microinjection were 3 – 4 generations after induced autogamy . Before microinjection , the cells were treated with 0 . 01 % of the secretagogue aminoethyldex - tran , AED ( Plattner et al . , 1984 ) to trigger trichocyst exocytosis , thus avoiding any further disturbance during microinjection . Cells were then washed twice in Dryl’s buffer ( 2 mM sodium citrate , 1 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 1 mM Na 2 HPO 4 and 1 . 5 mM CaCl 2 , pH 6 . 9 ) with 0 . 02 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) added . DNA microinjections were made with glass microcapillaries under an Axiovert 100TV microscope ( Zeiss , Oberkochen ) , using a micromanipulator with a manually controlled air - pressure microinjector . The expression of the GFP fusion constructs in cells clonally derived from microinjected cells was followed from 48 h on after transfection in a Zeiss Axiovert 100TV equipped with ﬁlter set 13 . When too weak , the GFP signal was ampliﬁed using anti - GFP antibodies described by Wassmer et al . ( 2006 ) . Such immuno - stainings were performed as described by Sehring et al . ( 2007b ) and below . The rabbit anti - GFP antibodies were applied in a dilution of 1 : 50 . As secondary antibodies , AlexaFluor 594 - conjugated anti - rabbit antibodies ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) were diluted 1 : 100 . Cells were analyzed in a conventional epiﬂuorescence microscope , type Axiovert 100TV , using ﬁlter set 15 . Images acquired with the ProgRes C10plus camera and ProgRes Capture Basic software ( Jenoptik , Jena , Germany ) were processed and arranged with Photoshop software ( Adobe Systems , San Jose , CA ) . Gene silencing constructs and silencing by feeding The double T7 - promotor plasmid pPD129 . 36 described by Fraser et al . ( 2000 ) was used in conjunction with the following primers : 5’Xba - Act4 - 1 ( 518 - 535 ) , 5’GCTCTAGAAAGCGCCAATCGGAGGA - G3’ 3’Xho - Act4 - 1 ( 885 - 903 ) , 5’CCGCTCGAGTGGTGCCAAAGCAGAC - AAG3’ . Polymerase chain reactions ( PCR ) and cloning of the sequence Ptact4 - 1 476 - 861 ( Table 1 ) to be used for gene silencing were carried out according to standard procedures . Gene silencing constructs were introduced in the RNaseIII - deﬁcient E . coli strain HT115 ( Timmons et al . , 2001 ) , and post - autogamous Paramecium cells were fed with these strains as described in more detail by Sehring et al . ( 2007b ) to achieve ‘‘gene silencing by feeding’’ ( Galvani and Sperling , 2002 ) . Silencing periods were up to 96 h , i . e . , more than 10 normal cell divisions . As a negative control , cells fed with the empty plasmid pPD129 . 36 or its GFP derivative ( Hauser et al . , 2000 ; Ladenburger et al . , 2009 ) , in addition to the unaffected wildtype cells have been used . For a positive control we applied the plasmid pPD - nd7 causing incompetence for trichocyst exocytosis ( Skouri and Cohen , 1997 ) . Analysis of nuclear division Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 ( Molecular Probes , Leiden , NL ) . The division stages of the macronucleus during vegetative binary ﬁssion of a Paramecium cell have been deﬁned according to Tucker et al . ( 1980 ) , as outlined in Fig . 1 . The effect of Ptact4 silencing on nuclear division categories has thus been analyzed . Determination of the cell division activity Single Paramecium cells were isolated in wells containing feeding media , and their number was counted 17 and 24 h after the onset of gene silencing , as this was found in time - resolved pilot experiments to encompass the critical time period for these experiments . After 24 h , cells were isolated again , transferred into fresh feeding media and their number counted after another 17 and 24 h , respectively . For ﬁnal evaluation , data obtained from all these single cell approaches were pooled . Phagocytosis tests For bright - ﬁeld microscopy , cells were fed for 10 min with Indian ink in a solution of 1 : 30 in Dryl’s buffer , immediately ﬁxed in 2 . 5 % ( v / v ) glutaraldehyde to stop the phagocytotic process and to count the number of ink - containing , newly formed food Fig . 1 . Nuclear events during the cell cycle of P . tetraurelia . This scheme shows changes in length , shape and position of the macronucleus ( mac , blue ) during the cell cycle , as well as the fate of each micronucleus ( mic , orange , including micronuclear separation spindles ) , the development of a new oral apparatus ( oa ) and the formation of new contractile vacuole complexes ( cvc ) according to Tucker et al . ( 1980 ) and Fok et al . ( 2002 ) . With the beginning of the ﬁssion ( stages I and II ) the macronucleus condenses slightly ( Stevenson and Lloyd , 1971 ) and starts to drift dorsally and anteriorly from its interﬁssion position . At stage III the nucleus is elongated and lies parallel to the longitudinal axis , close to the dorsal cortex . Between stages III and IV the elongation of the macronucleus still goes on and the whole length rapidly doubles from about 60 to up to 120 m m ( full cell length ) . Throughout the stages V and VI the macronucleus thins out centrically near the position of the cleavage furrow and ﬁnally divides . After separation of the daughter cells ( post - ﬁssion , PF ) both macronuclei adopt the shape of an elongated spheroid and are positioned near the oral apparatus again . The dorsal surfaces are oriented towards the left side of the diagram and the anterior poles towards the top . I . M . Sehring et al . / European Journal of Cell Biology 89 ( 2010 ) 509 – 524 511 ARTICLE IN PRESS vacuoles . For ﬂuorescence microscopy , cells were incubated in acridine orange ( 50 m g / ml ) for 1 . 5 min and observed using a Zeiss Axiovert 100 TV epiﬂuorescence microscope . Exocytotic activity test For a quick ( though lethal ) test of trichocyst exocytosis capacity we applied saturated picric acid , as usual in genetic studies with Paramecium . For analyzing the capacity of wildtype cells to re - dock their trichocysts at different times of Ptact4 silencing , we stimulated exocytosis by adding the secretagogue AED at 0 . 01 % ﬁnal concentration ( Plattner et al . , 1984 ) . Such cells were processed , after different times following AED stimulation , for immuno - ﬂuorescence analysis as described below , using an antibody against trichocyst matrix protein , TMP1 ( Vayssie´ et al . , 2001 ) . To test the ability of trichocyst membrane fusion , we used the ﬂuorescent membrane marker FM1 - 43 ( Molecular Probes , Eu - gene , OR ) . FM1 - 43 is spontaneously inserted into the outer leaﬂet of the plasma membrane from where it can diffuse into the membranes of exocytotic vesicles after fusion ( Henkel et al . , 1996 ) . Cells were triggered with 0 . 01 % AED , supplemented with 10 m M FM1 - 43 and 1 mM BAPTA ( ﬁnal concentrations , dissolved in 5 mM Pipes buffer pH 7 . 2 ) . While AED induces fusion of trichocyst membrane with the cell membrane , the low extra - cellular Ca 2 + concentration achieved by adding the fast Ca 2 + chelator BAPTA prevents release of secretory contents , resulting within seconds in a staining of membranes of docked / fused trichocysts ( Klauke and Plattner , 2000 ) . FM1 - 43 labeling was analysed with the Zeiss Axiovert 100TV equipped with ﬁlter set 9 . Endocytotic activity test With wildtype and Ptact4 silenced cells , endocytosis via coated pits ( ‘‘parasomal sacs’’ ) has been tested as indicated by Ramoino et al . ( 2001 ) . Brieﬂy , phagocytosis has been inhibited by triﬂuoperazine ( 2 . 5 m g / ml ; Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) and internalization of endocytotic vesicles from the cell surface has been followed with wheat germ agglutinin ( WGA ) labeled with AlexaFluo488 ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) for ﬂuorescence analysis in a Zeiss Axiovert 100TV equipped with ﬁlter set 9 . Cell harvesting , protein preparation , electrophoresis and Western blots Protein samples were collected 72 h after the onset of Ptact4 silencing and subjected to electrophoresis on 10 % SDS polyacryl - amide gels as previously described ( Ladenburger et al . , 2009 ) . Protein blotting onto nitrocellulose membranes was performed at 1 mA cm - 2 for 75 min using the semidry blotter from BioRad ( Munich , Germany ) . Membranes were blocked with 5 % non - fat dry milk dissolved in Tris - buffered saline plus Tween 20 ( 10 mM Tris - HCl , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 05 % Tween 20 , pH 8 . 0 ) and incubated for 1 h with primary antibodies . Detection was performed by goat anti - rabbit ( for polyclonal anti - Pt Act4 antibody detection ) and goat anti - mouse IgG ( for monoclonal anti - tubulin antibody detection ) , coupled to horseradish peroxidase ( 1 : 25 : 000 ; Dianova , Hamburg , Germany ) using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection ( ECL ) kit according to the manufacturer ( Amersham Biosciences , Freiburg , Germany ) . As loading control , tubulin was detected with the anti - tubulin antibody indicated below . Immuno - staining and ﬂuorescence microscopy For optimal immuno - localization of the various antigens and cellular structures , different protocols were required . For cortical labeling with the anti - Pt Act4 antibodies , immuno - staining was performed as described previously ( Sehring et al . , 2007b ) . For labeling of the macronucleus , cells were washed twice in 5 mM Pipes buffer , pH 7 . 0 , containing 1 mM KCl and 1 mM CaCl 2 , ﬁxed in 4 % ( w / v ) formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature ( RT ) and then permeabilized and ﬁxed in a mixture of 0 . 5 % digitonin and 4 % formaldehyde , dissolved in 5 mM Pipes buffer , pH 7 . 0 , for 30 min . Cells were washed twice in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , 2 (cid:3) 10 min , in PBS with 50 mM glycine added and 10 min in this solution with 1 % BSA added . The anti - Pt Act4 antibodies were applied in a dilution of 1 : 50 in PBS ( + 1 % BSA ) for 90 min at RT . After 4 (cid:3) 15 min washes in PBS , AlexaFluor 488 - conjugated anti - rabbit antibodies ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) , diluted 1 : 100 in PBS ( + 1 % BSA ) , were applied for 90 min , and followed by 4 (cid:3) 15 min washes in PBS . Samples were shaken gently during all incubation and washing steps . Cells were analyzed in a conventional epi - ﬂuorescence microscope , type Axiovert 100TV ( ﬁlter set 9 ) . Images acquired with the ProgRes C10plus camera and ProgRes Capture Basic software ( Jenoptik , Jena , Germany ) were processed and arranged with Photoshop software ( Adobe Systems , San Jose , CA ) . All other immuno - staining were carried out as described by Beisson et al . ( 2001 ) . The monoclonal anti - a - tubulin antibodies ID5 ( 1 : 500 ) ( Wehland and Weber , 1987 ) , recognizing in Para - mecium the C - terminal modiﬁcations of a – tubulin in ciliary basal bodies and post - oral ﬁbers ( Dupuis - Williams et al . , 1996 ) , and the polyclonal anti - g - tubulin antibodies ( 1 : 500 ) ( Klotz et al . , 2003 ) , recognizing ciliary basal bodies and micronuclei including mitotic and meiotic spindles , were used . Detection was performed with Texas Red - coupled anti - mouse and ﬂuorescein - ( FITC ) - coupled anti - rabbit antibodies ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs , West Grove , PA ) , respectively . For anti - TMP1 antibodies , see above . Cells were observed under a Zeiss Axioskop 2 - plus ﬂuorescence microscope equipped with a Roper Coolsnap - CF intensifying camera . Images were processed with Metamorph software ( Universal Imaging ) . Electron microscopic analyses After 96 h Ptact4 silencing , Paramecium cells were ﬁxed for 60 min at 0 1 C with 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde dissolved in 5 mM Pipes buffer , pH 7 . 2 , 0 1 C , with KCl and CaCl 2 , each 1 mM , added . After a wash step with 0 . 1 M cacodylate - buffer , pH 7 . 0 ( 0 1 C ) , for 15 min , cells were transferred into a solution of 1 % osmiumtetroxide in the same buffer , 0 1 C , 1 h , followed by routine dehydration in ethanol series and embedding in Spurr’s epoxide resin for standard electron microscopy ( EM ) of uranyl and lead ( pH 12 . 0 ) stained ultrathin sections . Results Selectivity of gene silencing and antibody localization First we shall check the chances of selective gene silencing and immuno - localization of the members of the actin4 subfamily by discrimination between other actin subfamilies . Second we shall ask for the chances to silence and to immuno - localize the ohnolog members of the actin4 subfamily in Paramecium . Evidently this depends on the degree of similarity of the Ptact4 ORF and of the Pt Act4 antigen , respectively . I . M . Sehring et al . / European Journal of Cell Biology 89 ( 2010 ) 509 – 524 512 ARTICLE IN PRESS Table 1 documents that Ptact genes of other subfamilies differ from Ptact4 - 1 by 54 . 2 to 71 . 3 % . Co - silencing would be possible only with genes of at least Z 85 % nucleotide identity ( Ruiz et al . , 1998 ) . We looked for coincident sequences of 21 - 23 nucleotides of the segment chosen for gene silencing in Ptact genes . This is considered a minimal size for achieving RNAi effects in general ( Elbashir et al . , 2001 ) . Homolog nucleotide sequences of this size are also assumed to mediate in Paramecium silencing of maternal genes before autogamy ( Garnier et al . , 2004 ) . No such coincident sequences were found except in the two Ptact4 paralogs . For generating actin4 - speciﬁc antibodies , a peptide with differences between 75 and 86 . 9 % to all other actin isoforms ( referred to actin4 - 1 , Table 1 ) has been chosen . From this one has to conclude that both , gene silencing and immuno - localization will be selective for subfamily actin4 , particularly since our experiments fulﬁll the following even more strict criteria . Comparing base pairs , the full length ohnolog ORFs of Ptact4 - 1 and Ptact4 - 2 , respectively , resemble each other by 90 . 8 % . For gene silencing , we chose PtAct4 - 1 476 - 861 , with an identity on base pair level of 88 . 6 % between the ohnologs . Our conditions , therefore , fulﬁll the prerequisites for selective silencing of the two Ptact4 genes . The similarity of the antigen used , Pt Act4 - 1 1 - 160 , to produce antibodies was 91 . 2 % when Pt Act4 - 2 is compared with Pt Act4 - 1 ( Table 1 ) . From this we can conclude that neither gene silencing , nor the anti - actin4 antibodies can discriminate between the two actin4 species . Since discrimination between the two forms of actin4 will not be possible , we complemented our analyses by expression of Pt Act4 - 1 as a GFP - fusion protein which allows for selective expression of this particular ohnolog . Altogether we have combined the different methods , for mutual control , as follows . Localization of PtAct4 When the carboxy - terminal Pt Act4 - 1 - GFP fusion construct was expressed in Paramecium cells , the macronucleus was predomi - nantly stained ( Fig . 2A ) . To enhance the GFP ﬂuorescence , antibodies against GFP were applied to transformed cells , resulting in staining of the oral apparatus , the cell cortex and the cleavage furrow ( Fig . 2B ) . As a protocol for labeling of cortical structures was used ( see ‘‘Material and methods’’ ) , no labeling of the macronucleus could be assessed . Previous localization studies with the anti actin4 antibodies showed similar labeling ( Sehring et al . , 2007b ) , but none of the macronucleus . In the present paper , by varying the ﬁxation and permeabilization protocol , we also observed labeling of the macronucleus ( Fig . 2C ) . Also note in Fig . 2D immuno - labeling of cilia . In order to control any possible redistribution of actin4 from the cytosolic compartment into the macronucleus , either due to GFP labeling or to permeabilization in the course of immuno - ﬂuorescence labeling , we ascertained the presence of actin4 in the macronucleus by postembedding immuno - electron microscopic gold labeling . This was performed essentially as in the work by Kissmehl et al . ( 2004 ) , but using speciﬁc anti - Pt act4 antibodies , followed by protein A - gold , 10 nm diameter . The labeling density was far beyond the background registered after omission of the primary antibody ; Pt act4 labeling was located mostly outside heterochromatic domains of the macronucleus ( data not shown ) . The conformity of these ﬁndings strongly supports a genuine localization of Pt Act4 in the macronucleus . Efﬁciency of Ptact4 gene silencing and its effects on immuno - staining and cell viability To ascertain the efﬁciency of silencing , the intensity of Pt Act4 - staining in silenced cells ( Fig . 2E ) was compared with that in control cells ( Fig . 2C , D ) . As a control for successful permeabiliza - tion and ﬁxation , tubulin staining was used ( Fig . 2F ) . Immuno - ﬂuorescence analyses showed that the labeling with monospeciﬁc anti - Pt Act4 antibodies was clearly reduced in silenced cells ( Fig . 2E ) , whereas labeling with the anti - g - tubulin antibody remained unaltered ( Fig . 2F ) . Efﬁcient silencing was also demon - strated in Western blots of silenced cells using tubulin as an invariant control ( Fig . 2G ) . The band of (cid:2) 38 kDa , as to be expected for the actin monomer , was stained with the anti - Pt Act4 antibody considerably stronger in the mock - silenced controls than in the Ptact4 silenced aliquots . Moreover , in preparations from the mock - silenced cells , the anti - Pt Act4 anti - body detected a most prominent band of dimeric Pt Act4 of (cid:2) 77 kDa , and this was totally downregulated in preparations from Pt Act4 silenced cells . The difference is even more signiﬁcant if one considers that the lane from the silenced cells was loaded with more protein , as evidenced by the anti - tubulin antibody staining of the same blot ( Fig . 2G ) . As described in more detail below , food vacuole formation was substantially reduced only after at least 72 h of gene silencing , thus implying that any earlier aberrant structural or functional aspects cannot be secondary effects due to the absence of nutrients and / or decreasing silencing by feeding the transformed bacteria . In the extreme , Ptact4 silencing ends with cell death after several days – a time period sufﬁcient to analyze step - by - step processes depending on actin4 . None of the control vectors had any effect comparable to that containing Ptact4 . As a positive control , the nd7 gene , which is essential for trichocyst exocytosis ( Skouri and Cohen , 1997 ) , was silenced in parallel experiments and 4 90 % of discharge - deﬁcient cells were obtained after 24 h ( data not shown ) . Cell division and cell motility Previous silencing experiments with different actin isoforms of P . tetraurelia revealed that only cells silenced over a long time period selectively in Ptact4 could not divide any more ( Sehring et al . , 2007b ) . Our current , more scrutinized analysis revealed that cell ﬁssion is inhibited already after 17 h of silencing ( Fig . 3 ) . In contrast , cell population growth was not inﬂuenced in control assays with nd7 silenced cells . Up to 24 h , under deﬁned conditions , control cells have divided about three to four times , whereas Ptact4 silenced cells had divided only once ( Fig . 3 , left ) . The latter were no longer able to complete a new cell cycle during an additional 24 h analysis ( Fig . 3 , right ) . From that time on , the number of cells with normal shape ( Fig . 4A ) began to decline and the ﬁrst misshapen ‘‘boomerang’’ cells became visible ( Fig . 4B , D ) . Such ‘‘boomerang’’ cells are assumed to result from inhibited cell division . It has to be noted that , in general , growth rate was slightly reduced in control cells during the ﬁrst hours of the feeding experiment , probably due to slower division of cells overcoming autogamy and the change of the bacteria used for feeding . In act4 silenced cells , the reduction of cell division analyzed in Fig . 3 by far exceeds this early reduction in the controls . As P . tetraurelia cultures cannot be synchronized and a certain time is needed for adaptation , a ‘‘ﬁrst division during silencing’’ can barely be determined . Our practical experience showed that an analysis at a time of Z 17 h after the onset of gene silencing is feasible . Within 24 h of Ptact4 silencing cells became increasingly immobile , but to have them resume normal swimming activity it sufﬁced to slightly shake such cultures . Consequently , activity of cilia on the cell surface – in contrast to the permanently active cilia in the oral cavity ( below ) – was reduced , but not blocked . I . M .

As a loading control , the same blot was probed with antibodies against a - tubulin ( a - tub ) . In lane prepared from Pt act4 silenced cells the anti - actin4 antibody recognized only a very faint band of (cid:2) 38 kDa ( right lane ) which in non - silenced cells ( left lane ) is much stronger . ( Note that the lane from the silenced cells displays a much more intense a - tubulin band , while , nevertheless , the 38 kDa band is much weaker . ) Particularly striking is , in control preparations , the occurrence of a prominent band of (cid:2) 77 kDa , corresponding to a Pt Act4 dimer ; in extracts prepared from pPD - Ptact4 treated cells this band is absent . I . M . Sehring et al . / European Journal of Cell Biology 89 ( 2010 ) 509 – 524 514 ARTICLE IN PRESS Nuclear events During Ptact4 silencing ( Fig . 4B - D ) it lasted (cid:2) 24 h until the ﬁrst cells showed up with the macronucleus blocked in a division process between stage I and II , as deﬁned by Tucker et al . ( 1980 ) , of the nuclear cycle ( Fig . 1 ) . The macronucleus , with a condensed round shape , typically occurring in controls ( Fig . 4A ) , was no longer able to elongate from the anterior towards the posterior pole as it commonly occurs in the 3 rd and 4 th stage of the vegetative cell cycle . Both ‘‘boomerang’’ ( Fig . 4B ) and normal shaped cells ( Fig . 4C ) occurred and they had abnormal , irregularly shaped macronuclei . Fig . 4C allows one to recognize a stop of cytokinesis before cell deformation . This is concluded from the occurrence , in some cells , of abnormal micronuclear division , in a manner resembling some events during sexual reproduction , rather than any of the stages of the vegetative cell cycle . A thick micronuclear separation spindle and crescent - shaped micronuclei became visible ( Fig . 4B ) . Furthermore , the number of micronuclei differed from cell to cell . Most cells contained several micronuclei ( Fig . 4B ) , while in rare cases , mostly in heavily deformed ‘‘boomerang’’ cells , only one micronucleus was present ( Fig . 4D ) . In the last stage of Ptact4 silencing by feeding ( 4 48 h ) the macronucleus lost its integrity ( Fig . 4B ) . Based on the outline of vegetative cell division stages sketched in Fig . 1 , we have evaluated in more detail the occurrence of the respective stages of the macronucleus ( Fig . 5 ) . In control cultures , over the entire analysis time of 72 h ( corresponding to almost 10 vegetative division cycles ) , the preponderant stages were III to VI as well as ‘‘interﬁssion’’ and ‘‘postﬁssion’’ stages . During Ptact4 silencing , the frequency of these stages decreased progressively , while that of stages I and II increased . Phagocytosis and autophagy Phagocytotic activity in Ptact4 silenced cells was not reduced within the ﬁrst two days , but it clearly was after 3 and 4 days ( Fig . 6 ) . When compared with the respective controls , silencing effects were clearly signiﬁcant ( although it is not clear why 72 h and 96 h controls are both below the control values for 24 and 48 h ) . Thus , after 72 h and 96 h of Ptact4 silencing , phagocytic activity dropped by (cid:2) 50 % and (cid:2) 70 % , respectively , as compared to the respective controls of the same time point , with signiﬁcance values of p o 0 . 001 . Although the swimming behavior of Ptact4 silenced cells was reduced already 24 h after silencing , i . e . , long before phagocytotic activity was affected , cilia of the oral cavity pursued their activity throughout silencing experiments . Staining of Ptact4 silenced cells with acridine orange , a weak base that accumulates in the acidosomes ( Allen and Fok , 1983 ) , revealed clusters of acidosomes around nascent food vacuoles ( Fig . 7A ) . EM analyses showed indeed an increased number of small vesicles near the oral cavity ( Fig . 7B ) , with a size and ultrastructure characteristic of acidosomes ( Allen and Fok , 1983 ) . EM analyses also revealed increased autophagy in Ptact4 silenced cells ( data not shown ) that paralleled the fact that such silenced cells are compromised in their energy supply due to their inability of food vacuole formation ( Plattner , 2010 ) . Constitutive endocytosis When the endocytotic process via clathrin - coated pits , i . e . , via ‘‘parasomal sacs’’ is followed by uptake of WGA - Alexa488 , the ﬂuorescence is initially found at the cell surface and deeper inside the cell in small vesicles . In our current experiments , after a chase period of 20 - 30 min in unlabeled medium , the ﬂuorescent vesicles have fused with food vacuoles ( Fig . 8A ) , essentially as described previously ( Allen et al . , 1988 ; L¨uthe and Plattner , 1986 ; Ramoino et al . , 2001 ) . By contrast , in cells silenced in Ptact4 no such redistribution could be observed ( Fig . 8B ) . Instead , in addition to the surface staining , in the cell cortex aberrant tubular structures emerged ( Fig . 8C , D ) . To determine their identity , we supplemented these studies by EM analyses . Here , after Ptact4 silencing , we frequently encountered abnormally shaped , sometimes elongated and incorrectly positioned early endosomes ( ‘‘terminal cisternae’’ ) as shown in Fig . 9 . Stimulated exocytosis and exocytosis - coupled endocytosis Ptact4 silenced cells with a normal shape were only slightly impaired in their exocytotic capacity ( r 10 % ) . Immuno - labeling Fig . 3 .

This implies the previous clearing of ‘‘ghosts’’ by exocytosis - coupled endocytosis ( data not shown ; for reference pictures , see Plattner , 1993 ) . In ‘‘boomerang’’ cells , exocytosis of trichocysts was reduced by 4 90 % ( data not shown ) . Oil immersion bright - ﬁeld microscopy revealed a normal set of docked trichocysts in these cells ( Fig . 10A , C ) . Analysis of the ability of trichocyst membrane fusion by ﬂuorescence microscopy using FM1 - 43 ( as indicated in ‘‘Materials and methods’’ ) showed that membrane fusion of the remaining trichocysts was impaired after Ptact4 silencing ( Fig . 10 ) . Here , residual exocytosis ( Fig . 10B ) was roughly as in nd7 silenced positive controls , where only a small number of the docked trichocyst was able to fuse ( Fig . 10E ) . This number was considerably below that in non - silenced controls ( Fig . 10F ) where many more fusion events occurred . In the extreme , after Ptact4 silencing , stimulated exocytosis may be totally absent , as we observed ( Fig . 10D ) .

This observation has also been substantiated by EM analysis of ultrathin sections tangentional to the cell surface ( data not shown ) . However , we cannot absolutely exclude some local disturbances in a small percentage of cells or cell regions over longer times of Ptact4 silencing . Additional defects due to actin4 silencing The division and forming of a new oral apparatus was also affected by Ptact4 silencing , particularly in ‘‘boomerang’’ cells . The development of the new oral apparatus was delayed , so that oral apparatus development and cell division were uncoordinated ( Fig . 4D ) . In ‘‘boomerang’’ cells , no fully developed new oral apparatus could be recognized ( Fig . 4B ) , possibly as a secondary effect of cell shape change . The situation is quite different with the contractile vacuole complexes . In parallel to the decreasing cell division rate during ongoing Ptact4 silencing , up to eight contractile vacuole com - plexes were seen to accumulate in one cell . In Fig . 4C we present an example with ﬁve such complexes . Fig . 5 . Comparison of the macronuclear shape of control cells ( pPD - GFP ) and cells silenced in Ptact4 at different times of silencing . Cells with a round macronucleus typical of stages I and II are pooled for pPD - GFP and for Ptact4 silenced cells , respectively . Similarly , cells with an elongated macronucleus ( occurring during stages Int , III - VI and PF of the vegetative life cycle [ see Fig . 1 ] ) are pooled from the two types of samples . Some macronuclei of control cells and many of Ptact4 silenced cells showed an irregular , split or tattered shape ( see Fig . 4B ) . Such cells could not be assigned to any stage of the vegetative cell cycle and are pooled as ‘‘abnorm’’ . An increased number of blocked and abnormal macronuclei could be observed already after 24 h of Ptact4 silencing .

Comparison of silencing of different actin genes in Paramecium Before we analyzed in detail the effects of Ptact4 silencing in the present paper we had previously performed pilot analyses by gene silencing with a variety of different actin subfamilies already ( Sehring et al . , 2007b ) . Only silencing of the Ptact4 or Ptact9 gene resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction of the division rate although actin4 silencing exerted this effect already after 17 h ( rather than only after 24 h ) , as we now observe . Whereas Ptact4 silenced cells additionally assumed a ‘‘boomerang’’ phenotype , cells silenced in Ptact9 assumed a triangular shape . Both were swimming in narrow circles , probably due to their morphological changes . Cells silenced in Ptact2 , Ptact3 or Ptact4 were very stagnant and accumulated at the bottom of the culture wells . Such cells and those silenced in Ptact7 or Ptact9 were found to contain a signiﬁcantly reduced number of phagosomes compared with control cells . These results clearly reveal that a variety of functions depend , directly or indirectly , on actin and that isoforms cannot deliberately substitute for each other . The goal of our present work was a more detailed analysis of the effects speciﬁcally of Ptact4 silencing , with a more precise timing , and envisaging additional effects that previously had not been taken into consideration , such as effects on endocytosis , exocytosis , phagocytosis , karyokinesis and cytokinesis . For instance , it remained unsettled whether reduced phagocytotic activity would precede other disturbances , thus energetically compromising cells , which then could entail some secondary effects . In fact , our current results are to the opposite , as discussed below . Comparison with previous analyses – before molecular biology became available In some previous studies unusually high concentrations of F - actin depolymerizing drugs had to be applied to inhibit phagocytosis in Tetrahymena ( Zackroff and Hufnagel , 1998 , 2002 ) or Paramecium ( Fok et al . , 1985 ) . Under such conditions , some later steps of the phagocytotic cycle were also inhibited ( Fok et al . , 1987 ) . As to be analyzed in future work , this low sensitivity may be due to weak binding – an aspect known from different Pt Act isoforms ( Sehring et al . , 2007b ) . For Paramecium we now can present more speciﬁc experiments showing that food vacuole formation essentially requires the actin paralog Pt Act4 . Among the actins associated with food vacuoles , only paralogs of the Pt Act1 , 3 , and 5 families are appropriate for the visualization by phalloidin binding , whereas Pt Act8 has no complete set of phalloidin binding signatures ( Sehring et al . , 2007a ) . Although Pt Act4 is associated with the nascent food vacuole , its replacement by Pt Act1 – in addition to Pt Act3 and Pt Act5 – may account for the binding of phalloidin after pinching off ( Kersken et al . , 1986a , 1986b ) . Since Pt Act4 is absent from phagosomes undergoing cyclosis ( Sehring et al . , 2007b ) , this may explain ongoing cyclosis , once an organelle has formed , while phalloidin can inhibit food vacuole formation ( Kersken et al . , 1986a ) due to the presence of Pt Act1 isoforms . Although the interaction of actin isoforms with phago ( lyso ) somes / food vac - uoles is complex , it may allow for some mutual functional replacement ; this may also explain the fact that inhibition of phagocytosis by Ptact4 silencing proceeds only gradually . In retrospect , many of the Pt Act isoforms , including Pt Act4 , could not be visualized previously , neither by phalloidin due to lack of binding ( Sehring et al . , 2007a ) , nor by gold immuno - EM analyses ( Kissmehl et al . , 2004 ) since the antibodies then used recognized predominantly Pt Act1 ( Sehring et al . , 2007b ) . Both these restrictions are particularly valid for the cleavage furrow Fig . 10 . FM1 - 43 analysis of exocytotic membrane fusion capacity . Cells exposed to FM1 - 43 during exocytosis triggering by AED at low extracellular calcium to prevent secretory content release ( see ‘‘Material and Methods’’ ) .

Another alternative is the expression of Pt Act4 as a GFP fusion protein ( this paper ) . All the observations reported are fully compatible with the inhibition of cell division we now observe selectively after Ptact4 silencing . Does reduced phagocytosis entail the other silencing effects ? Over a long time period phagosome formation is not affected by Ptact4 silencing , even after 48 h ; a Z 50 % reduction occurs only after 72 h ( Fig . 6 ) . The earliest effect we see concerns cell division rate ( Fig . 3 ) and this effect is combined with the emergence of aberrant nuclear division stages ( Figs . 4 , 5 , and 11 ) . Cell division of actin4 silenced cell is reduced within the ﬁrst 24 h of silencing , when referred to controls , and the number of actin4 silenced cells drops dramatically during ongoing silencing . Thus , food uptake is restricted only when other effects have occurred already and the latter , therefore , are unlikely due to reduced food / energy supply . This is also supported by our observation of ongoing ‘‘silencing by feeding’’ over long time periods . This delayed response of phagosome formation to Ptact4 silencing is surprising as this paralog is the only one we detected in association with the formation of a nascent food vacuole , particularly since the silencing effect must be very selective according to the large difference in the nucleotide sequence when compared to any other Ptactin paralogs ( Table 1 ) . The maximum deviation of 15 % allowing co - silencing of different isoforms ( Ruiz et al . , 1998 ) is clearly surpassed ( Table 1 ) , so that only Ptact4 - 1 and Ptact4 - 2 ( 90 . 8 % identity ) can be reasonably assumed as being co - silenced in our current experiments . The delayed effect on phagosome formation may be attributed to the presence of a large Fig . 11 . Summary of the different Ptact4 silencing effects .

( 1980 ) and Fok et al . ( 2002 ) . s7 : Inhibition of cleavage furrow formation . ( B ) refers to the structure of a Ptact4 silenced cell . Cells perform no elongation of the macronucleus ( s1 ) . Some silenced cells contain only one micronucleus or several micronuclei in different division stages ( s3 ) .

Sehring et al . / European Journal of Cell Biology 89 ( 2010 ) 509 – 524 520 ARTICLE IN PRESS pool of Pt Act4 in the cells and its efﬁcient recycling selectively along the phagocytotic route . Additionally , remaining actin4 from other sources might be ﬁrst and foremost recruited to the phagosomal machinery to secure the maintenance of energy supply . Reduced phagocytotic activity ﬁnally entails the accumulation of acidosomes near the cytopharynx ( Fig . 7 ) , as they are normally used for complementing of the nascent phagosome membrane ( Allen et al . , 1988 , 1993 ; Allen and Fok , 1983 ) . Although cells become sluggish already early on during Ptact4 silencing , cilia of the oral cavity persistently continue beating – in the extreme until cell death . Also for this reason reduced cell motility is unlikely to be the cause of any of the effects described above . To summarize , we see disturbances in cell division from 17 h on , accompanied by reduced swimming activity , emergence of ‘‘boomerang’’ cells ( 24 h ) , a block in macronuclear division and a dramatic deformation of macronuclei ( 48 h ) and inhibition of food vacuole formation ( 72 h ) . Therefore , neither can reduced phago - cytosis be attributed to reduced cell motility , nor can the other effects mentioned be attributed to reduced phagocytosis . Rather a direct effect on locally enriched and functionally signiﬁcant pools of Pt Act4 has to be envisaged . In fact , Pt Act4 does occur at the sites which are affected by its silencing , as summarized in Fig . 11 . Two sites are affected within the same time period by Ptact4 silencing , micronuclear reshaping and oral cavity morphogenesis . Although a correlation between the two defects had been described already ( Fujishima and Watanabe , 1981 ; Tam and Ng , 1986 ) , any link to actin4 had not been known . Cell division , motility and surface patterning Inter alia , Pt Act4 is localized to the cleavage furrow ( Sehring et al . , 2007b ) , as analyzed in more detail here . Concomitantly , silencing of the actin4 genes inhibits cell division ( Fig . 3 ) . As P . tetraurelia cultures were not synchronized , the silencing effect occurred during various stages of cell division . Therefore , postﬁssion cells , cells with normal cell shape and ‘‘boomerang’’ cells could be observed . Previous work with Tetrahymena has shown the association of proﬁlin and of an actin bundling inducing protein , EF - 1 a , ( Numata and Gonda , 2001 ) and speciﬁ - cally of the actin bundling protein , ﬁmbrin , ( Shirayama and Numata , 2003 ) with the midplane between dividing cells . In Tetrahymena , this has been supplemented by most recent work demonstrating the importance of a speciﬁc actin isoform for the ﬁnal step of cell separation of daughter cells ( Williams et al . , 2006 ) . In this work the cleavage furrow was not stained and cleavage furrowing was normally completed ; both these ﬁndings are in contrast to our current observations with PtAct4 where the cleavage furrow was labeled by GFP or by antibodies from the very beginning . Therefore , in their and in our work different actin molecules may be at work . The decay of cell culture density with increasing Pt Act4 silencing times we see may be a general phenomenon which in ciliates accompanies inhibition of completion of karyo - and cytokinesis . Speciﬁcally this has been observed during silencing of actin , type Act1p in Tetrahymena ( Tab . 1 in Williams et al . , 2006 ) as well as in Paramecium during exposure to a range of microtubule - reactive drugs ( Pape et al . , 1991 ) . This may reﬂect the fact that individual ciliate cells have a restricted life - span , whereas cultures are often referred to as examples of immortality . Since biogenesis of cilia remains unaffected during Ptact4 silencing ( data not shown ) , although actin is involved in this process ( Pan et al . , 2007 ) and Pt Act4 occurs in cilia ( Fig . 2D ) , this may indicate supplementation by the other actin paralogs . In fact , Pt Act1 , Pt Act2 , Pt Act3 , and Pt Act5 also occur in the cilia of Paramecium ( Sehring et al . , 2007b ) . Some disturbance does occur , however , after Ptact4 silencing , insofar as cells reduce their swimming activity which they resume after slight mechanical stimulation . Reduced ciliary activity is compatible with the established occurrence of actin in Tetrahymena ( Williams et al . , 2006 ) and Paramecium ( Kissmehl et al . , 2004 ) , together with its requirement for the correct positioning of inner - arm dynein in Chlamydomonas ﬂagella ( Yanagisawa and Kamiya , 2001 ) . In the Paramecium cell cortex , we had previously localized Pt Act1 , Pt Act3 , Pt Act5 , and Pt Act8 , in addition to Pt Act4 ( Sehring et al . , 2007b ) . When compared with normal cells ( Iftode et al . , 1989 ) surface pattern formation remained practically unchanged during Ptact4 silencing ( Fig . 4D’ ) , even at a stage of disturbed karyokinesis . This may also be attributed to the occurrence of multiple actin isoforms in the cell cortex which , in this case , may be able to substitute for each other . Endocytosis and exocytosis In normal Paramecium cells exogenous lectins such as WGA are endocytosed and delivered to phagosomes ( Allen et al . , 1988 ; L¨uthe and Plattner , 1986 ; Ramoino et al . , 2001 ) , as was the case with our controls ( Fig . 8 ) . Ptact4 silencing severely affects formation of early endosomes . After sufﬁciently long Ptact4 silencing periods we see aberrant terminal cisternae ( Fig . 9 ) which normally represent ﬂat sacs located parallel to the cell surface below the ciliary basal bodies ( Allen et al . , 1992 ) . They are considered as platforms for constitutive exo - and endocytosis via parasomal sacs ( Fl¨otenmeyer et al . , 1999 ) . In general , both processes , positioning of dense core - secretory vesicles for exocy - tosis ( Jog et al . , 2007 ; Malacombe et al . , 2006 ) and performance of endocytosis ( Smythe and Ayscough , 2006 ; Soldati and Schliwa , 2006 ) involve some local F - actin assembly . Therefore , formation of aberrant compartments , rather than ‘‘properly’’ formed and positioned terminal cisternae after Ptact4 silencing is not surprising . This also agrees with the ﬁnding in mammalian cells that cortical actin drives pinching off ( ‘‘scission’’ ) and internaliza - tion of endosomes ( He et al . , 2008 ; Robertson et al . , 2009 ; Yarar et al . , 2005 ) . In normal - shapen Ptact4 silenced cells , internalization of ‘‘ghosts’’ from trichocysts after stimulated exocytosis does occur , as one can infer from the re - insertion of newly formed trichocysts ( data not shown ) . These processes may , therefore , involve some of the other cortical actin isoforms found in Paramecium , rather than Pt Act4 . Accordingly , previous immuno - gold localization with antibodies ( recognizing mainly Pt Act1 ) revealed actin around docked trichocyst tips ( Kissmehl et al . , 2004 ) , but not Pt Act4 ( Sehring et al . , 2007b ) . In deformed cells , such as ‘‘boomerang’’ , membrane fusion and therefore trichocyst release and ‘‘ghost’’ internalization is reduced ( Fig . 10A - D ) . In sum , subtle distur - bances affecting various distinct cortical functions , such as exo - and endocytosis , may subside the name - giving morphological change of ‘‘boomerang’’ cells . The reason may be that several steps of exocytosis and endocytosis reportedly depend on actin ( Plattner , 2010 ) which , in the case of Paramecium , seems to be determined by the isoform actin4 . Nuclear events The effects of Ptact4 silencing on nuclear structure and shape change we describe ( Fig . 11 ) are novel , as the dependency on this actin isoform had not been seen before . Some of the micronuclei assumed a shape which could not be referred to any stage of the vegetative cell cycle . Under normal conditions , only some sexual stages contain similar micronuclear forms ( Fujishima , 1983 ; I . M . Sehring et al . / European Journal of Cell Biology 89 ( 2010 ) 509 – 524 521 ARTICLE IN PRESS Fujishima and Hiwatashi , 1981 ) . Thus , the normal timing between mitosis of the micronucleus and amitosis of the macronucleus might be uncoupled . Many studies have shown that the functions of actin in the nucleus are as diverse as in the cytoplasm ( Grummt , 2006 ; Schleicher and Jockusch , 2008 ) . Nuclear actin is a component of chromatin remodeling complexes , it is important for nuclear transport of proteins and RNA , it is indispensable for transcription by RNA polymerases , and it is necessary for nuclear envelope assembly ( for review see Bettinger et al . , 2004 and Pederson and Aebi , 2005 ) . The actin pool in the nucleus comprises monomeric , oligomeric and polymeric populations ( McDonald et al . , 2006 ) . Nuclear actin may adopt a conformation that is not typically encountered in the cytosol ( Gonsior et al . , 1999 ) . Clearly we found in Western blots a dimeric form only with antibodies against PtAct4 ( this paper ) , but not with the antibodies previously generated mainly against PtAct1 isoforms ( Kissmehl et al . , 2004 ) . With anti - PtAct4 antibodies , the dimeric band is much stronger than the monomeric one , both being downregulated by silencing . In mammalian cells , speciﬁc antibodies recognizing the ‘‘lower dimer’’ conformation of actin ( Millonig et al . , 1988 ) detected a discrete form of actin in the nucleus of ﬁbroblasts ( Schoenenberger et al . , 2005 ) . Nevertheless it would be premature to claim the same for our current Western blot analyses . In fact , different actin types are reportedly liable to form dimers under widely different conditions ( Bubb et al . , 2002 ; Millonig et al . , 1988 ) . Further investigations are required along these lines . As known from higher eukaryotic cells , the nuclear envelope is bound to the F - actin cytoskeleton ( Wilhelmsen et al . , 2006 ) . This may help to position nuclei ( Starr and Han , 2003 ) which , in Paramecium , also involves a subset of microtubules ( Cohen et al . , 1980 , 1982 ) . Spindle positioning relies on an actin ﬁlament network also in higher eukaryotic cells ( Azoury et al . , 2008 ) . It is established that actin is frequently connected to microtubules in uni - ( Collings et al . , 1996 ) as well as in multicellular organisms up to mammals ( Pederson and Aebi , 2005 ; Rodriguez et al . , 2003 ) and such links have been documented at the EM level also in Paramecium ( Kissmehl et al . , 2004 ) . Actin4 occurring in the cell cortex could account for the positioning of microtubules engaged in positioning nuclei ; for microtubules this effect is well established ( Cohen et al . , 1980 ) . Effects on the biogenesis of the contractile vacuole system As the duplication of contractile vacuoles is one of the ﬁrst steps during cell division ( Klotz et al . , 2003 ) , the occurrence of multiple contractile vacuoles during Ptactin4 silencing may be considered a phenomenon related to impaired cell division . A possible explanation may be the following . Duplication of those organelles is not impaired and takes place in regular intervals , independent of the actual performance of cell division . This would also be compatible with the fact that no actin isoform , including actin4 , could be detected so far in association with these organelles , and that it is rather well established that they operate independently of actin . Conclusion Using RNAi methods we could show speciﬁc functions of the Pt Actin4 subfamily which were compatible with its localization . In most cases , these speciﬁc functions could not be adopted by any other isoforms . While in P . tetraurelia many genes might have been retained after a recent whole - genome duplication because of gene dosage constraints , clearly a functional diversiﬁcation of the actin subfamilies has occurred , as we could show in this paper speciﬁcally for actin4 . By contrast , actin4 ohnologs probably exert identical functions since we obtain identical localization by antibodies against both actin4 ohnologs as by expression selectively of Pt Act4 - 1 as a GFP fusion protein . Therefore , both Pt Act4 ohnologs serve the same function at the same sites . Acknowledgments We thank the following colleagues from the CNRS in Gif - sur Yvette ( France ) : Drs .
