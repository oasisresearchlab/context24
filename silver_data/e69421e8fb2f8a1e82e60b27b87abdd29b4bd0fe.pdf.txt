Schmit , ∗ Ercan Kamber , † and Jan´e Kondev ‡ Department of Physics , Brandeis University , Waltham MA 02454 USA . We study the eﬀect of conﬁnement on diﬀusion limited bi - molecular reactions within a lattice model where a small number of reactants diﬀuse amongst a much larger number of inert particles . When the number of inert particles is held constant the rate of the reaction is slow for small reaction volumes due to limited mobility from crowding , and for large reaction volumes due to the reduced concentration of the reactants . The reaction rate proceeds fastest at an intermediate conﬁnement corresponding to volume fraction near 1 / 2 and 1 / 3 in two and three dimensions , respectively . We generalize the model to oﬀ - lattice systems with hydrodynamic coupling and predict that the optimal reaction rate for mono - disperse colloidal systems occurs when the volume fraction is ∼ 0 . 18 . Finally , we discuss the application of our model to bi - molecular reactions inside cells as well as the dynamics of conﬁned polymers . PACS numbers : It is a somewhat surprising fact that the total concen - tration of protein within a cell rivals that within a pro - tein crystal [ 1 ] . This highly crowded environment plays an important role in dynamical processes , such as rates of chemical reactions , and thermodynamic properties , such as chemical equilibria , observed in vivo [ 2 ] . While the volume fraction of macromolecules within the cell may exceed 30 % , there may be just a few copies of a given pro - tein corresponding to a concentration of a few nanomo - lars for a cell of volume 1 µ m 3 [ 4 , 5 ] . This is in stark contrast to in vitro experiments where the reactants are present at a relatively high concentration with a neg - ligible level of crowding molecules . Therefore , caution is required when interpreting in vivo biochemical experi - ments as it is not always obvious what eﬀect the presence of crowding molecules will have . For example , the rate of a reaction may be increased if the crowding favors a compact transition state , decreased if the reaction is dif - fusion limited , or unaﬀected if the reactants are small compared to the crowding species [ 6 ] . In this letter we study the eﬀect of crowding on re - action rates in a ﬁnite system with a ﬁxed number of particles . A biological cell represents such a system . We ﬁnd that the presence of non - reactive particles leads to a non - monotonic reaction rate as the volume of the system is changed . This non - monotonicity is the result of two distinct dynamical regimes . When the system volume is very large the eﬀect of the crowding particles is negli - gible . Therefore , the rate of reaction is dictated by the time required for the reactants to diﬀuse the mean sep - aration between reactive particles which increases with the system size . We will call such systems “concentra - tion limited” . At the opposite extreme is the case where the system volume is very close to the sum of the total volume of the reactant and crowding particles . In this ∗ schmit @ brandeis . edu † ekamber @ brandeis . edu ‡ kondev @ brandeis . edu case the separation between reactants may be quite small , but the reaction proceeds slowly because the high den - sity of crowding particles severely impedes the diﬀusion of the reactants . Such systems are “crowding limited” . Between these two limits there is an optimal volume at which the reaction proceeds the fastest . The competition between the concentration lim - ited and crowding limited regimes may be understood through the following simple argument . The ﬂux of par - ticles at the surface of an absorbing sphere is 4 πac r D , where a is the radius of the sphere , and the concen - tration of particles far from the sphere , c r , is inversely proportional to the volume of the system c r ∝ R − 3 [ 7 ] . The eﬀect of crowding particles that do not react with the absorbing sphere may be included through a rescal - ing of the diﬀusion constant D provided the distance the reactant particles must travel is large compared to the mean spacing between crowding particles . For the case of a lattice - based system , a mean - ﬁeld diﬀusion constant ( which is exact when the crowding particles move much faster than the reactants ) is achieved by multiplying the “bare” diﬀusion constant D 0 by the success rate for a particle move . This results in a diﬀusion constant of the form D ∼ D 0 p where p = ( 1 − c ) is the probability that the neighboring site for an attempted move is unoccu - pied , and c is the number density of particles on the lat - tice . Therefore , the ﬂux at the absorbing surface scales as a ( 1 − Nb 3 R − 3 ) / R 3 , where N is the total number of particles in the system and b is the lattice constant . This expression has a maximum when the system size is such that the particle density is 1 / 3 . In order to go beyond this simple argument , we have explored the transition from concentration limited reac - tions to crowding limited reactions using an analytically tractable model with two reactant particles that react instantaneously upon contact . With this simpliﬁcation , the reaction “rate” is just the inverse mean ﬁrst passage time for the particles to ﬁnd each other . If we make the further simpliﬁcation of holding one of the reactants 2 ﬁxed , the mean ﬁrst passage time is given by ¯ τ = 1 V Z V τ ( ~ x ) d d ~ x ( 1 ) where the integral is over the d - dimensional volume of the system . τ ( ~ x ) , the average time for the mobile reactant at ~ x to reach the stationary target , satisﬁes the equation [ 8 ] D ∇ 2 τ ( ~ x ) = − 1 . ( 2 ) Eq . 2 is subject to a reﬂecting boundary condition at the system periphery and an absorbing boundary condition at the surface of the stationary reactant . If we place the ﬁxed reactant at the center of a spherical box , as shown in Fig . 1 , Eq . 1 is exactly solvable with the result ( in two and three dimensions ) ¯ τ 2 D = 1 2 D ( c ) ( R 2 − a 2 ) (cid:18) R 4 ln (cid:18) R a (cid:19) − 3 R 4 4 + R 2 a 2 − a 4 4 (cid:19) ( 3 ) ¯ τ 3 D = 6 D ( c ) ( R 3 − a 3 ) (cid:18) R 6 3 a − 3 R 5 5 + R 3 a 2 3 − a 5 15 (cid:19) . ( 4 ) Here a is the radius of the stationary target , and D ( c ) is the concentration dependent diﬀusion constant . In the spirit of the mean - ﬁeld argument introduced earlier , we employ a lattice model and utilize an excellent approx - imation for the self - diﬀusion of a lattice gas derived by van Beijeren and Kutner [ 10 ] . For reactant and crowd - ing particles with equal mobilities on a square lattice , the self - diﬀusion constant takes the form D ( c ) = Γ b 2 8 (cid:16)p 4 ( 1 − c ) + c 2 ( π − 1 ) 2 − c ( π − 1 ) (cid:17) , ( 5 ) where b is the lattice spacing , Γ is the attempt rate for particle moves , and c is the ratio between the total num - ber of mobile particles to the number of accessible sites c ≃ b 2 ( N + 1 ) / ( π ( R 2 − a 2 ) ) . ¿From Eqs . 3 and 5 we ﬁnd an expression for the reaction time which is plotted in Fig . 2 . We have preformed Monte Carlo simulations of this model consisting of one reactant and N inert particles conﬁned to a two dimensional circular box of radius R with a circular target of radius a placed at the center , as shown in Fig . 1 . Each run of the simulation begins with a random conﬁguration of the reactant and crowding particles and ends when the reactant reaches the center target at which point the ﬁrst passage time is recorded . The average reaction time is determined from 10 , 000 such runs . For the purposes of our simulation we deﬁne the box and the target to include all sites on the lattice with a distance to the origin less than or equal to R and a , re - spectively . Although the deﬁnition of a circular box on a square lattice is somewhat cumbersome , this geometry is advantageous relative to square or rectangular boxes be - cause the circular box allows for non - integer adjustments of the linear box dimension with minimal change to the FIG . 1 : Snapshot from the simulation described in the text . The stationary target is indicated by the black circle in the center , and the mobile reactant is the black dot halfway be - tween the target and the top of the outer circle . Also shown are the 2000 inert crowding particles ( grey ) . overall geometry . This ﬁne - tuning of the box size greatly increases the number of data points that can be collected in the crowding limited regime . The simulation used N = 2000 crowding particles which , like the single mobile reactant , each occupied a single lattice site . The central target had a larger size a = 3 to minimize the discreetness eﬀect of the lattice when comparing to the continuum theory given by Eq . 1 . The radius of the conﬁning box was varied from R = 150 to R = 26 . 7 lattice spacings , corresponding to densities from c = 0 . 03 to c = 0 . 90 . The results are shown in Fig . 2 . The simulation results show a minimum in the reac - tion time very near the minimum of 36 . 9 predicted by Eq . 3 ( corresponding to 47 % of the sites being occupied ) . The reaction times diverge sharply when the box radius becomes less than 29 lattice sites , or the concentration exceeds ∼ 75 % . At large box radii the reaction times increase as R 2 and approach the reaction rate in the ab - sence of crowding particles ( green line ) . As shown in Fig . 2 the diﬀerence between the crowded and uncrowded re - action times is nonzero at all system sizes . This can be explained by noting that while the probability that a given site is occupied scales as R − d , the required number of steps scales like R d . The result is that the number of time steps where the particle is unable to move due to crowding remains nearly constant as the system size is increased . 3 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 x 10 4 Linear system size ( b ) R eac t i on T i m e ( m cs ) FIG . 2 : ( color online ) Comparison of the reaction time pre - dicted by Eq . 1 ( black dashes ) to the simulation data ( red dots ) . The green dashes indicate the reaction time predicted in the absence of crowding particles . Error bars ( not shown ) are smaller than the size of the dots . The reaction times in Fig . 2 deviate from the theoreti - cal curve at system sizes below 50 b with a maximum error of 39 % at the highest concentration simulated . This dis - crepancy is due to a non - diﬀusive , logarithmic correction to the mean squared displacement ( MSD ) in the lattice gas system [ 11 ] . This correction allows the reactant to sample its immediate surroundings more eﬃciently than a purely diﬀusive particle . The eﬀect of the correction term can be seen in Fig . 3 where we compare the MSD of the reactant in our simulations to the expected MSD ( as calculated from the Green’s function ) for a random walker in a circle with diﬀusion constant given by Eq . 5 . At the largest system size , when the particle density is 0 . 1 , the agreement between the simulation and calculated MSD is better than 3 % at all times . At R = 35 . 8 and R = 26 . 7 , where the particle density is 0 . 5 and 0 . 1 respec - tively , the discrepancy between the observed and calcu - lated MSD is 8 % and 18 % respectively at short times and shrinks at later times as the MSD saturates . Our results can be extended to the more physically relevant three dimensional , oﬀ - lattice system with a few modiﬁcations . We recall that hard sphere systems un - dergo a glass transition at a volume fraction φ c ∼ 0 . 58 , which is less than the close packing density [ 9 ] . Al - though the system is not completely frozen , the rele - vant time scales diverge sharply . Therefore , we restrict our analysis to densities below φ c . In the ﬂuid regime , for φ < φ c , the self diﬀusion constant is modiﬁed not only by the short range excluded volume interactions , but also by long range hydrodynamic coupling mediated by the solvent [ 19 ] .

Using the self - diﬀusion constant derived in reference [ 19 ] ( equation 4 . 34 ) , together with Eq . 4 , we predict that the opti - mal reaction time for mono - disperse , hard - core , Brown - ian spheres occurs when the system size is such that the volume fraction is ∼ 0 . 18 . Experimentally , a crowded reaction with adjustable volume could be realized using microﬂuidic techniques . In this case the tracer and crowding particles would be conﬁned to a micro droplet reaction vessel whose volume could be controlled through osmotic gradients across a semi - permeable barrier [ 12 ] . This system mimics in vivo experiments that show increased tracer particle diﬀusion in osmotically swollen cells [ 13 , 14 ] . In most systems of interest the target reactant would be mobile rather than stationary . One expects that the ratio of the reaction time for the stationary target to the reaction time for two mobile reactants in a ﬁxed box size should be independent of the number of crowding par - ticles present , as the crowding particles merely rescale the diﬀusion time . Our simulations support this intu - ition , and we ﬁnd that the ratio is ∼ 1 . 6 and ∼ 2 . 0 in two and three dimensions respectively , with corrections on the order of a / R . In the context of these theoretical results it is natu - ral to ask to what extent do cells optimize biochemical reaction rates by adjusting their size ? At ﬁrst glance it would seem unlikely that cell volume would be a useful parameter for the cell to use to regulate reaction rates due to the large number of reactions that occur simul - taneously . Furthermore , diﬀerential protein expression rates during the cell cycle could modify the overall pro - tein concentration and thereby alter the cytoplasmic dif - 4 fusion rate [ 15 ] . However , it is well known that the cell is more complicated than a “bag of enzymes , ” and there - fore , the potential exists for the cell to compartmentalize reactions in such a way that the volumes of the compart - ments are individually tunable . For example , the diges - tion of a pathogen within a macrophage occurs within a vesicle created by endocytosis . The volume of this vesicle is , in principal , adjustable by the amount of membrane used during vesicle creation . Similarly , other membrane - bound organelles such as golgi , endoplasmic reticulum , mitochondria , and the nucleus could be individually ad - justed to optimize reactions occurring within . This is consistent with the ﬁnding that diﬀusion rates in the mi - tochondria and endoplasmic reticulum can diﬀer substan - tially from the cytoplasm [ 16 , 17 ] . The case of the cell nucleus deserves special consid - eration . Here the primary reactions of importance in - volve the manipulation of the genome which is encoded by DNA . In analogy to our two reactant model , many of the genome management functions the cell performs re - quire two speciﬁc portions of the DNA to ﬁnd each other . These internal cyclization reactions may occur between monomers separated by polymer spacers ranging from less than a persistence length , up to lengths on the order of the chromosome size [ 20 , 21 ] . If we identify the polymer segments that ﬂank and bridge the reacting monomers as crowding particles , then we can immediately generalize the preceding argument for the rate of crowded reactions to the internal cyclization of a conﬁned polymer . Specif - ically , the rate of internal cyclization will have a non - monotonic dependence on the size of the box containing the polymer . This non - monotonicity has been previously observed in computer simulations [ 22 ] . The onset of crowding limited dynamics at small sys - tem sizes leads to non - monotonic behavior in the relax - ation of other structural properties of the polymer such as the end - to - end vector [ 23 ] . This non - monotonicity is quantitatively diﬀerent from that of crowded reactions due to the sub - diﬀusive behavior of the monomers im - posed by the connectivity constraint . However , it can be easily explained by noting that the initial eﬀect of reduc - ing the volume accessible to the polymer to smaller than its unconﬁned size is to reduce the conformational phase space that the polymer can sample . This allows the poly - mer to sample the phase space faster resulting in shorter relaxation times . However , like the free particle case , as the monomer density approaches the close - packing limit the polymer becomes jammed and the relaxation times lengthen . We have shown that a simple , analytically tractable model is able to quantitatively predict reaction times occurring within crowded environments . This model can be generalized to oﬀ - lattice systems and systems with explicit solvent with slight modiﬁcation . The non - monotonicity in the reaction times shown here has broad implications for reactions within cells as well as the dy - namics of conﬁned polymers . Acknowledgments We would like to thank B .
