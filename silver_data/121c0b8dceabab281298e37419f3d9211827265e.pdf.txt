To date , COVID - 19 case rates are disproportionately higher in Black and Latinx communities across the U . S . , leading to more hospitalizations and deaths in those communities . These differences in case rates are evident in comparisons of Chicago neighborhoods with differing race / ethnicities of their residents . Disparities could be due to neighborhoods with more adverse health outcomes associated with poverty and other social determinants of health experiencing higher prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection or due to greater morbidity and mortality resulting from equivalent SARS - CoV - 2 infection prevalence . We surveyed five pairs of adjacent ZIP codes in Chicago with disparate COVID - 19 case rates for highly specific and quantitative serological evidence of any prior infection by SARS - CoV - 2 to compare with their disparate COVID - 19 case rates . Dried blood spot samples were self - collected at home by internet - recruited participants in summer 2020 , shortly after Chicago’s first wave of the COVID - 19 pandemic . Pairs of neighboring ZIP codes with very different COVID - 19 case rates had similar seropositivity rates for anti - SARS - CoV - 2 receptor binding domain IgG antibodies . Overall , these findings of comparable exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 across neighborhoods with very disparate COVID - 19 case rates are consistent with social determinants of health , and the co - morbidities related to them , driving differences in COVID - 19 rates across neighborhoods . .

From early in the pandemic , stark racial / ethnic disparities were evident in COVID - 19 deaths . Subsequent analyses of public health surveillance data further explicated the nature of COVID - 19 racial disparities , with many studies showing that communities with more Black or Latinx residents had higher case and mortality rates ( 3 ) . Studies examining the drivers of these racial / ethnic disparities have found relatively consistent associations with residential segregation of economic disadvantage , proportion of essential workers , and crowded living conditions ( 4 - 6 ) . There have been inconsistent results across studies regarding whether comorbidities mediate the observed racial / ethnic disparities ( 3 , 7 , 8 ) . The analyses demonstrating such disparities mostly relied on molecular testing to diagnose acute , symptomatic COVID - 19 illness by detecting SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs ( 9 ) . However , from the beginning of the pandemic until the present , acute viral diagnostic testing has not always been readily accessible to all . This could limit accurate estimation of the COVID - 19 case rate and epidemiological patterns of SARS - CoV - 2 spread by not identifying minimally symptomatic and asymptomatic , but potentially infectious , cases ( 10 - 13 ) . Many infections are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic , although still capable of transmitting SARS - CoV - 2 to others ( 10 ) . A complementary epidemiological approach is serological testing to detect antibodies against the virus ( 14 , 15 ) . Virus protein - specific antibodies emerge within weeks after infection , and subsequent IgG specific antibodies remain detectable for 4 or more months after infection , depending on assay sensitivity and specificity . This is much . CC - BY - NC - ND 4 . 0 International license It is made available under a is the author / funder , who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity .

Thus , serology has portential to identify infections long after their initiation , independent of clinical diagnosis and symptom experience , potentially providing a fuller epidemiologic assessment of the pandemic . Assessment of all SARS - CoV - 2 exposures by antibody detection can also test the hypothesis that risk of the viral infection itself varies by race / ethnicity , rather than only a subsequent COVID - 19 illness being associated with race / ethnicity . Fewer seroprevalence studies of racial and geographic disparities have been reported to date , relative to comparisons of virus RNA - based COVID - 19 case surveillance . These studies suggest there are racial / ethnic disparities in SARS - CoV - 2 infection , although they have some limitations and inconsistent results . One early study of fingerstick blood specimens collected at grocery stores in New York state observed significantly higher prevalence of IgG antibodies to the SARS - CoV - 2 nucleocapsid protein , assessed as detectable versus not detectable antibody , among Latinx , Black , and Asian adults relative to white adults ( 21 ) . Another study in Baton Rouge using the qualitative Abbott SARS - CoV - 2 anti - nucleocapsid IgG nucleoprotein enzyme - linked immunosorbent assays ( ELISA ) assay ( ARCHITECT TM platform ) was not indubitably confirmatory , as it found much smaller differences . Weighted seroprevalence was 9 . 8 % among participants who were Black , 7 . 1 % multiracial , 5 . 5 % Asian , 4 . 5 % White , and 5 . 3 % Hispanic ; confidence intervals were non - overlapping except for Asian and Hispanic ( 22 ) . Both reports had the limitation that the qualitative anti - nucleocapsid antibody assays used have been reported to not be as sensitive and specific as quantitative ELISA detection of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 spike glycoprotein receptor binding .

Previous reports suggest that an anti - RBD IgG assay exhibits superior performance compared to an anti - nucleocapsid IgG assay ( 19 , 23 - 26 ) . These two earlier assessments of racial / ethnic disparities in seroprevalence also relied on in - person collection of samples at a clinical care or research site , which limits reach and coverage during varying pandemic mitigations such as stay at home orders similarly to acute virus diagnostic testing . In Chicago , like many cities , there are large differences in documented rates of COVID - 19 cases and fatalities across neighborhoods that vary in their racial / ethnic and socioeconomic composition ( 2 ) . However , the lack of comprehensive seroprevalence assessments reported to date has not yet enabled analysis of whether SARS - CoV - 2 infections are similarly disparate . The current study tested the hypothesis that geographic disparities in COVID - 19 case rates will be mirrored in seroprevalence rates , using a more sensitive , specific , and quantitative antibody assay than the earlier reports ( 21 , 22 ) . Moreover , the antibody assay used here is not dependent upon access to in - person testing at care or research sites . To achieve this , we utilized dried blood spots ( DBS ) collected in the home setting using a simple finger prick method . This followed web - and mass media - facilitated participant recruitment and online screening / consenting . After blood collection , participants’ DBS cards were returned to the laboratory for testing in pre - paid mailers . We used a previously described the DBS - based quantitative ELISA for IgG to the receptor binding domain of the SARS - CoV - 2 protein ( 27 ) . Our study design offered a strong opportunity to confirm the hypothesis that geographic disparities would be similar in molecular diagnostic and serosurveillance assays across 5 pairs of Chicago ZIP codes that both bordered one .

Results instead suggest there are differences in COVID - 19 illness between these neighborhoods , but not SARS - CoV - 2 infection . METHODS All research activities were implemented under conditions of informed consent with protocols approved by the institutional review board of the university where the authors are primarily affiliated . Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools ( 28 ) . To select ZIP code pairs , COVID - 19 cumulative case rates by ZIP code were obtained from Chicago Department of Public Health’s COVID - 19 website ( 2 ) . Additional health , socio - economic , and demographic ZIP code level data were selected from US Census Bureau American Community Survey ( 29 ) and the Chicago Health Atlas ( listed in Table 2 ) ( 30 ) . ZIP codes were ranked based on the CDPH COVID - 19 cumulative case rate for the week of 4 / 26 / 20 - 5 / 2 / 20 . Low case rate ZIP codes ( category 1 or 2 ) that were adjacent to high case rate ZIP codes ( category 4 or 5 ) were selected for review . In cases were multiple touching ZIPs met the criteria , a ZIP was selected based on additional criteria listed in Table 2 . Five ZIP code pairs were chosen based on geographic location , highest case rates , and these additional socio - economic , health , and demographic characteristics . Procedures To achieve a diverse representation of residents of these ZIP codes , participants were recruited through two mechanisms . First , community - based participants ( n = 1 , 509 ) were recruited from ten ZIP codes in Chicago through social media advertising , .

Participants were screened for eligibility , which included ZIP code residence and age of 18 years or over . To assure racial and gender diversity within the sample , enrollment of women and white participants ( groups that disproportionately completed the screener ) was adaptively matched to enrollment of men and racial - minority participants within each ZIP code . Second , staff , students and faculty from the Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine ( FSM ) in Chicago , IL were sent an email describing the study with a link to the website ( n = 158 who lived in one of the 10 study ZIP codes ) . Eligible participants were invited to complete a questionnaire regarding health status , including COVID - 19 symptoms . Community participants received materials for DBS collection through the United States Postal Service ( USPS ) and returned their test kits using prepaid USPS envelopes provided to them by the study team . Those affiliated with FSM were given a specific time to collect DBS kits in person and were instructed to return their completed kits to the same location . The research team developed a video that explained to participants all of the steps of DBS collection and return ( 31 ) . Sample collection occurred between June 24 and November 23 , 2020 . We measured antibodies to RBD because previous studies have reported better sensitivity and specificity for SARS - CoV - 2 infection detection than seen with anti - nucleocapsid antibodies ( 19 , 23 - 26 ) . Anti - RBD antibodies have infrequent and low - level cross - reactivity to other seasonal human coronaviruses ( 32 , 33 ) , an advantage relative to detection of antibodies to other SARS - CoV - 2 proteins . The ELISA protocol we used has been validated for DBS and previously described ( 27 , 34 ) . Samples were run in .

Results were normalized to the CR3022 antibody with known affinity ( 35 ) . A value > 0 . 39µg / ml CR3022 was considered positive . Statistical analysis Unadjusted and adjusted binomial logistic regression was performed to compare seroprevalence within each ZIP code pair . Age , race / ethnicity , gender and prior COVID - 19 testing result were used as covariates when reporting adjusted odds ratios . Geographical information system ( GIS ) analyses were conducted using ArcGIS Pro 2 . 6 . 2 . Only participants who were geocoded using the StreetAddress or AddressPoint locator and were geocoded to the ten ZIP codes chosen for analysis were included in the geospatial analysis ( n = 1 , 666 ) . Data sources for GIS data are indicated in Table 2 . RESULTS Table 1 reports sample characteristics . A slight majority of the sample was non - Latinx white ( 54 . 3 % ) , most had never tested for COVID - 19 ( 71 . 4 % ) , and the sample was heterogenous in terms of employment - based SARS - CoV - 2 exposure risk . Overall , the seroprevalence in the sample was 18 . 7 % . As indicated by non - overlapping confidence intervals in estimates in Table 1 , seroprevalence was significantly higher in Latinx ( 25 . 9 % ) than White non - Latinx ( 15 . 6 % ) , and in those who had previously tested COVID - 19 positive ( 90 . 2 % ) than those who had never tested ( 17 . 2 % ) or tested negative ( 16 . 1 % ) . Figure 1 shows a map with the distribution of seropositive and seronegative negative participants within the 10 ZIP codes . Finer grain maps of participants’ residential locations with geographic features overlayed ( e . g . , highways , train yards , waterways , etc . ; not shown to protect participant confidentiality ) suggested an even .

This even distribution suggests a lack of clustering of participants along paired ZIP code boundaries in a way that would have confounded our analyses of similarities between case rates and seroprevalence . Multiple approaches to geospatial hotspot analyses did not demonstrate significant cluster of seroprevalence within ZIP codes . Table 2 presents characteristics of the 10 ZIP codes included in the study . In each pair , the ZIP code with the higher case rate is in the column to the left of the ZIP code with the lower case rate . Cumulative case rates in all ZIP codes increased from the time when ZIP codes were first selected to the end of data collection , and most ZIP code pairs were relatively stable in terms of the ratio of reported cases across pairs , with the exception of pair 5 ( 60643 and 60655 ) . In this pair , 60655 had a much larger increase in the case rate than any other ZIP code . Rates of COVID - 19 testing by ZIP code were not available at the time of ZIP code selection , but were subsequently released . Across pairs , cumulative test numbers in April / May were higher ( pairs 1 , 2 , 4 ) in ZIP codes with more cases or similar across pairs ( pairs 3 , 5 ) . By November , number of cumulative tests became more similar across pairs . Zip code pairs varied considerably in certain observed characteristics , such as population size , markers of healthcare accessibility ( i . e . , rates of avoidable emergency department visits ) , transportation - based exposure risk ( i . e . , use of public transportation to work ) , poverty , and race / ethnicity . Race / ethnicity of study participants also varied by ZIP code , but non - white participants were underrepresented in each . Better representation was achieved with Latinx participants . .

Table 3 shows odds ratios of seroprevalence within each of the 5 ZIP code pairs , none of which were significant ; even trends across pairs did not support the hypothesis that adjacent ZIP codes with higher case rates trended towards a higher seroprevalence based on antibody testing . Adjustments with individual - level covariates that differ across ZIP codes ( e . g . , race / ethnicity ) did alter some point estimates but did not change the pattern of significance of results . Analyses weighting data to census characteristics ( not shown ) also did not alter the pattern or significance of findings . DISCUSSION In this study we sought to test the hypothesis that geographic differences in epidemiology of COVID - 19 based on case reports would be confirmed in a seroprevalence study of IgG antibodies to the SARS - CoV - 2 spike protein . Our comparison of 5 adjacent ZIP codes with substantially different COVID - 19 case rates at the time of selection did not confirm this hypothesis . In unadjusted , adjusted , and weighted analyses , there were no significant differences in seroprevalence between ZIP codes in the same pair . This suggests little association between case rates by ZIP code and infection rates as estimated by serosurveillance . There are several possible explanations for why seroprevalence may not track case rates . First , it is possible that our seroprevalence study provided a better representation of SARS - CoV - 2 epidemiology than case rates . We used a highly sensitive assay ( 27 ) , and therefore likely detected positive individuals who were asymptomatic and never sought testing . At times , diagnostic testing in Chicago was .

Further , participants in the current study could be screened for antibodies by providing a sample they collect at home , and even when diagnostic testing was available , some individuals feared leaving their home to go to testing spaces . Along these same lines , serological antibody testing is a marker of past infections , whereas PCR diagnostic testing only detects active infections . If serology is indeed a more accurate representation of SARS - CoV - 2 epidemiology , it would suggest that exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 may have been more widespread than is indicated by case rates . This conclusion is also supported by a recent study comparing seroprevalence to case rates in 10 sites in the U . S . ( 36 ) . Second , it is possible that , due to the sensitivity of the assay used in our study , we detected individuals who had lower doses of exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 virus at the time of exposure , which may be associated with an asymptomatic or less intense clinical presentation ( 37 , 38 ) . If this is true , then observed variation in case rates across ZIP codes may actually represent differences in severity of illness . Individuals with a larger exposure doses may have an increased likelihood of experiencing symptoms and subsequently receiving diagnostic testing . Thus , individuals across these ZIP code pairs may not differ in their rates of actual exposure , but instead in their dose of exposure . If this is the case , it suggests that the use of serosurveillance studies to inform public health action may need to consider the disconnect between detection of any exposure and clinical risk . Quantitative antibody assays linking levels of antibody response to clinical presentation may be particularly useful for such research . At the same time , .

While 10 ZIP codes is too few for a formal statistical test , in our study a widely used metric of residential crowding ( % of housing with 1 . 51 + occupants per room ) showed little - to - no association with ZIP code seroprevalence . Of course , ZIP code level living density is not synonymous with density assessed at the level of a single home , so future research should assess number of people in home and in a shared bedroom . A third possibility is that case rates are closely tied to symptoms , and symptoms are tied to older age and underlying comorbidities ( 39 ) , so even in conditions of constant levels of exposure / infection / transmission across neighborhoods , those with more social determinants of chronic diseases would tend to have higher case rates— assuming equal access to testing . When study ZIP codes were selected in April / May , testing as a proportion of the population was low across all ZIP codes ( mean = 8 . 3 % range 3 . 1 - 16 . 0 % ) , but increased until at study completion most ZIP codes had more cumulative tests than residents . While the current sample size of 10 ZIP codes is too small to compute a correlation , the pattern of results does not suggest that diagnostic testing rates are positively associated with seropositivity . Census markers of poor healthcare access also did not show a strong positive trend with seropositivity . Admittedly , these are crude markers of presence of chronic diseases so future studies should examine additional markers . Overall , this pattern is consistent with more uniform spread of infections , including those that are asymptomatic , across Chicago ZIP codes than would be suggested by case surveillance data . .

Differences by age , gender groups , and employment status stratified by possible exposure risk were not significant . As an epidemiological confirmation of the validity of the antibody assay used in this study , participants who self - reported a prior positive COVID test were substantially more likely to be seropositive than those who did not ( 90 . 2 % versus 16 . 1 - 17 . 2 % ) . Most racial minority groups trended toward higher seropositivity , but the only significant difference was between Latinx and White , non - Latinx participants ( 25 . 9 % versus 15 . 6 % ) . These findings are consistent with case surveillance in Chicago , which indicated that at the time of the launch of data collection , case rates were surging in the Latinx community . As of February 5 , 2021 , the infection case rate in the Latinx population was higher than non - Latinx White and Black combined ( 10 , 797 . 4 , 4 , 851 . 2 , and 5 , 227 . 8 , respectively ) ( 2 ) . Test positivity rates showed a similar pattern . Cumulative deaths since the beginning of the pandemic have occurred substantially more among Black Chicagoans ; in fact , this alarming pattern is what inspired the focus of this study seeking to understand disparities in SARS - CoV - 2 spread . Fortunately , these inequities in deaths from COVID - 19 have shrunk over time as death rates overall have declined in the context of more effective prevention and treatment . This pattern is consistent with some partial role of pre - existing comorbidities in explaining racial disparities in COVID - 19 disease and death ; the magnitude or existence of such an effect is still contested in the existing literature and will require further research ( 3 , 7 , 8 ) . Such an effect would support repeating again the call to urgently address social determinants of health that produce inequities in chronic diseases that will exacerbate medical disparities when pandemic occur ( 40 , 41 ) . .

This was not a probability sample , but instead obtained through social and news media , community outreach , and employees of a large medical school . Our goal was not to provide population estimates of seroprevalence , rather we sought to look at relative rates within pairs of carefully selected adjacent ZIP codes with differing case rates . Nevertheless , our estimation of seroprevalence within ZIP codes may be biased by our sampling approach . For example , despite attempts to target recruitment from Black communities , the proportion of Black participants in the study underrepresented the demographics of Chicago . We sought to partially correct for this with sensitivity analyses that included demographic covariates and weighting . Further , individuals who opted to volunteer to participate when reading about the study through widespread coverage in local news , social media ads , or community outreach may not represent the entire community . Second , participants were required to self - collect a DBS sample . Through well - produced videos and collection materials we hoped to minimize concerns , but selection biases may still have operated . Conclusion Our findings indicate that exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 may be more consistent across neighborhoods within Chicago than was previously thought based on reported COVID - 19 case rates . This suggests that factors other than differential seroprevalence may play a role in driving disparities in COVID - 19 outcomes . One possibility is that pre - existing chronic conditions are associated with greater risks of symptomatic infection , leading to higher rates of symptomatic illness and case detection in groups with higher rates pre - existing chronic conditions . Another possibility is that the average dose of .

Differences in viral dose may occur for a variety of reasons including differences in adherence to preventive behaviors , work environments , or living situations . Our results highlight the importance of investigating other factors besides differential exposure as potential drivers of inequity in COVID - 19 outcomes . .

This suggests that the prevalence of SARS - Cov - 2 exposure does not account for neighborhood differences in COVID - 19 case rates . 0 . 0 1 . 0 2 . 0 3 . 0 4 . 0 5 . 0 6 . 0 7 . 0 8 . 0 9 . 0 10 . 0 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 Pair 1 Pair 2 Pair 3 Pair 4 Pair 5 C u m u l a t i v e C a s e R a t e p e r 100 , 11 / 15 - 11 / 21 S e r o p r e v a l e n c e R a t e Seroprevalence rate Lower 95 % CL Upper 95 % CL Cumulative Case rate per 100 people , week of 11 / 15 - 11 / 21 .
