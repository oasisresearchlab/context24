Gardel § 2 From the ‡ Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry , Yale University , New Haven , Connecticut 06511 and the § Institute for Biophysical Dynamics , James Franck Institute , and Department of Physics , University of Chicago , Chicago , Illinois 60637 Cell physiological processes require the regulation and coor - dination of both mechanical and dynamical properties of the actin cytoskeleton . Here we review recent advances in under - standing the mechanical properties and stability of actin fila - ments and how these properties are manifested at larger ( net - work ) length scales . We discuss how forces can influence local biochemical interactions , resulting in the formation of mechan - ically sensitive dynamic steady states . Understanding the regu - lation of such force - activated chemistries and dynamic steady states reflects an important challenge for future work that will provide valuable insights as to how the actin cytoskeleton engenders mechanoresponsiveness of living cells . Actin Cytoskeleton The non - covalent polymerization of the cytoskeleton pro - tein actin ( Fig . 1 ) into linear filaments powers a variety of non - muscle cell movements underlying their migration , division , and assembly into multicellular tissue ( 1 ) . Cross - linking pro - teins arrange filaments into higher - order assemblies such as parallel bundles of filopodia and microvilli , isotropic networks of the cortex , and contractile bundles in the lamella that pro - vide cells with mechanical integrity , sensing , and shape ( 2 – 4 ) . Contractile myosin motor proteins generate force and work output ( i . e . motility and transport ) along filament tracks , in both muscle and non - muscle cells ( 5 ) . Actin filaments grow and shrink from their ends through subunit addition and loss , respectively . Accordingly , the overall assembly dynamics and turnover of the actin cytoskeleton in cells is influenced by factors that modulate the filament end concentration . Nucleating proteins and complexes generate new filament ends , often branching from existing filament tem - plates ( 1 ) . Capping proteins bind filament ends and slow or inhibit subunit addition ( 1 ) . Severing and contractile proteins fragment actin filaments and accelerate actin turnover in cells and in reconstituted biomimetic systems ( 6 – 12 ) . Actin Structure Actins are single polypeptide chain proteins ( (cid:2) 375 amino acids with an (cid:2) 42 - kDa molecular mass ) folded into a U - shaped structure containing four subdomains ( SD1 – 4 ) with a bound adenine nucleotide , either ATP , ADP - P i , or ADP , and an asso - ciated divalent cation , Mg 2 (cid:3) in cells , bound within the cleft separating subdomains 1 – 2 and 3 – 4 ( Fig . 2 A ) . Actin filaments are commonly described as either a one - start , left - handed helix of subunits with a 2 . 77 - nm rise per subunit ( 13 ) or a two - start , right - handed helix with half - staggered filament strands dis - playing an (cid:2) 72 - nm repeat ( 14 ) . However , filaments in solution adopt multiple distinct structural states ( referred to as “struc - tural polymorphism” ( 15 ) ) with variable twist and subunit tilt distributions that are influenced by regulatory protein occu - pancy and external forces . Thus , one actually refers to a subset of populated states when describing actin structure . Polymerization is associated with a conformational change in actin , such that incorporated filament subunits appear “flat - tened” when compared with free monomers ( 16 , 17 ) . Extensive intersubunit contacts stabilize filaments ( 16 – 18 ) , and an indi - vidual subunit contacts four neighboring actin molecules ( Fig . 2 A ) . Longitudinal contacts within a strand are thought to be stronger than lateral contacts across the strands ( 19 ) . The DNase I binding loop ( residues 36 – 52 of SD2 ; Fig . 2 A ) adopts a variety of conformations ( 20 ) , some of which make important long - axis , intersubunit contacts , and plays a central role in reg - ulating actin filament structure and mechanical properties ( 21 , 22 ) . Actin Filament Mechanical Properties Actin filaments are polymers with lengths ranging up to (cid:4) 10 (cid:2) m in solution ( 23 ) ( Fig . 2 B ) . The local asymmetry arising from the ribbon structure averages out to a diameter of (cid:2) 6 nm on the length scales associated with analysis of individual filament and network mechanics . How filaments deform in response to force is governed by their mechanical elastic properties . Recent bio - chemical , biophysical , and computational studies have revealed the molecular and geometric origins of actin filament mechan - ical properties and how solution conditions , particularly cat - ions , influence them . Bending , torsional , and twist - bend coupling elasticities dom - inate individual actin filament mechanical properties . The flex - ural , or bending , rigidity as well as the extent of deformation determine the energy required to bend a filament segment of a certain length . Likewise , the energy require to twist a filament is determined by the twisting rigidity and the torsional angle that overwinds or unwinds the filament . Twist - bend coupling rep - resents an obligatory coupling between bending and twisting motions , such that filament bending introduces twist and vice versa ( 24 , 25 ) ( Fig . 2 C ) . Actin filaments are rather resistant to stretching ( 26 ) . However , stretching forces dampen bending * This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grant GM097348 ( to E . M . D . L .

Filament mechanical properties are determined by the strength and distribution of intersubunit contacts ( 24 ) . Subunit compliance and compressibility ( 28 , 29 ) presumably play a role in overall filament mechanics . However , mathematical and computational models that treat filament subunits as incom - pressible entities capture the reported mechanical parameters with reasonable accuracy ( 24 , 25 ) . Filaments twist more easily than they bend , which manifests itself as a larger bending than torsional rigidity . Solution cations bind and stiffen some , but not all ( e . g . Sac - charomyces cerevisiae ) , actin filaments ( 20 , 30 ) . Substitution of a single amino acid residue positioned between adjacent , long - axis filament subunits confers S . cerevisiae actin filaments with salt - dependent bending stiffness ( 30 ) . The filament bending stiffness ( i . e . flexural rigidity , (cid:3) ) is equal to the product of the shape - independent stiffness of the protein material ( i . e . appar - ent Young’s modulus , E app ; referred to as apparent because pro - teins are not homogenous isotropic materials ) and the shape - dependent second moment of area ( I ) , which is determined by the strength and distribution of intersubunit contacts . Fila - ments possessing this “stiffness cation site” display salt - depen - dent structure and intersubunit contacts , suggesting that stiff - ness cations may exert their effects on filament mechanics by binding to discrete sites at subunit interfaces and altering the radial distribution ( I ) and / or the strength ( E app ) of the intersub - unit contacts ( 18 ) . A mechanism in which cations bind at distal sites and allosterically alter intersubunit contacts is also plausi - ble ( 31 ) . The DNase I binding loop of SD2 participates in lon - gitudinal intersubunit contacts , plays a central role in modulat - ing the filament bending stiffness and displays salt - dependent conformations , making it an attractive structural element for linking salt - dependent filament structure and mechanics . Changes in filament stiffness can also arise from side binding proteins . For example , tropomyosin stiffens actin filaments by increasing its geometric movement ( 32 ) . Mechanically strained filaments ( e . g . deformed in bending and / or twisting ) store elastic free energy in their shape . The FIGURE 1 .

Relaxation back to the straight conformation can potentially be used to generate work and / or force . Alternatively , the deformation amplitude and stored energy can reach the point of irreversibility , causing the filament to fragment . Thermal energy ( k B T , where k B is Boltzmann’s constant and T is temperature in Kelvin ) can be sufficiently large to induce actin filament shape fluctuations . The filament length at which the deformation energy compares to thermal energy defines the persistence length , which can be defined for bending ( L B ) , twisting ( L T ) , and twist - bend coupling ( L TB ) deformations ( Fig . 2 D ) . Filaments behave as rigid rods at lengths much shorter than the persistence length , as flexible polymers much larger than the persistence length , and as semi - flexible polymers at lengths comparable with the persistence length ( 33 ) . The bend - ing fluctuations reduce the filament end - to - end length , and the force required to extend and “straighten” the filament is deter - mined by the energy required to reduce the bending fluctuation amplitude . This entropic spring constant is both highly sensi - tive to the length of filament segment and becomes highly non - linear as the end - to - end length approaches the full polymer contour length ( 34 ) ( Fig . 3 ) . Compressive forces tend to excite the longest wavelength ( softest ) bending mode , which is comparable with k B T for micrometer length filaments . At a critical compressive force , referred to as critical or Euler force , buckling will occur . The critical force scales linearly with filament bending rigidity and inversely with the square of the filament length ( e . g . it takes four times less force to buckle a 2 - (cid:2) m filament than a 1 - (cid:2) m one with identical bending rigidity ) ( 35 ) . This different response to extension and compression gives filaments a highly asymmetric force extension curve ( Fig . 3 ) that can be approximated in coarse - grained models as cables ( 36 ) and is a powerful mecha - nism by which actin networks can sense ( and respond ) to dif - ferent types of stresses ( 9 ) . Cross - linking proteins organize filaments into parallel ( or antiparallel ) bundles . The mechanical parameters ( twist , bend , and extension ) of bundles depend on the width of the bundle and length of the filaments comprising them , as well as the F o r c e [ p N ] 0 . 01 Linear Entropic 0 . 01 0 . 1 1 100 1 C o m p r e ss i on E x t en s i on Enthalpic NonlinearEntropic Complete Distance [ µm ] F o r c e [ p N ] 0 20 40 60 80 100 1 . 06 1 . 1 1 . 02 0 . 98 0 . 94 0 . 9 End - to - end Distance [ µm ] 0 . 94 0 . 96 0 . 98 1 1 . 02 1 . 04 FIGURE3 .

For forces larger than (cid:2) 0 . 1 pN , this entropic spring becomes non - linear , diverging as the end - to - end distance approaches the contour length in the case of an inextensible filament ( dotted black line ) , just as for a worm - like chain ( 76 , 81 ) . Actin filaments are not inextensible , however , and the incorporation of a Young’s Modulus of 2 . 3 gigapascals ( 26 ) and proper renormalization of the force ( 76 ) yields a more complete picture ( solid black line ) , wherein filaments may be extended beyond their contour length . At forces larger than (cid:2) 100 pN , the end - to - end distance exceeds the contour length and asymptotically approaches the response of a purely enthalpic linear spring ( dashed blue line ) . Experiments ( 82 ) suggest that filaments rupture at forces of (cid:2) 400 pN . Under compression , the critical Euler buckling force is (cid:2) 0 . 4 pN ( 76 ) , allowing for a large range of end - to - end distances under nearly constant force ( solid black line ) .

For instance , filaments in bundles formed with a compli - ant cross - linker ( e . g . plastin ) can readily slide past each and are weakly coupled such that the bundle stiffness increases linearly with the number of actin filaments ( 37 ) . By contrast , when fil - aments become tightly coupled to each other by use of crowd - ing agents or high density of compact cross - linker ( e . g . fascin ) , the bundles act as single unit that displays a bending persistence length that scales quadratically with the number of filaments in the bundle ( 23 , 37 ) . In some cases , the cross - link density can impact the degree of coupling and the observed scaling of bun - dle stiffness ( 37 , 38 ) . Because actin cross - linking proteins are dynamic , the bundle mechanics are also frequency - dependent and depend on the cross - link dynamics as well ( 37 , 39 ) . Filament Fragmentation Fragmentation by severing and contractile motor proteins accelerates actin network turnover and assembly dynamics by increasing the concentration of filament ends where subunits can add and dissociate . As described above , compressive stresses buckle filaments . However , filaments under compres - sive loads do not deform indefinitely . Rather , they buckle and bend until they reach a deformation curvature where the stored elastic energy exceeds that holding the subunits together and it becomes energetically more favorable for the filament to frag - ment than remain intact ( 40 ) . Estimating this stored energy and force requires that all elastic contributions be considered ( e . g . bending , twisting , and coupling ) because they all contribute to the local energy density that eventually causes filament subunit interface “bonds” to rupture ( 40 ) . Several classes of regulatory filament - severing proteins have been identified ( 14 ) . Gelsolin and ADF 3 / cofilin family members have been characterized most extensively at the biochemical and biophysical level with purified components ( 14 ) . Gelsolin severs filaments by inserting one of its structural domains between long axis filament subunits , compromising stabilizing intersubunit interactions and promoting fragmentation . Formin INF2 may sever filaments by an analogous insertion , or “wedging , ” mechanism ( 41 ) . The filament - severing mechanism of ADF / cofilin ( hereto - fore referred to as cofilin ) appears to be distinct from that of gelsolin and INF2 . Cofilin isoforms within and across organ - isms and species are not identical , and often the observed bio - chemical activities depend on the isoform and conspecific nature of the actin ( 42 , 43 ) , indicating that the chemical and physical properties of actin itself can influence cofilin function . Cofilins bind weakly to “young” ATP - and ADP - P i actin fila - ments and bind orders of magnitude more strongly to “old” ADP - actin filaments ( 42 ) , which allows for spatially targeted disassembly ( 44 ) . Vertebrate cofilin binding is positively coop - erative ( 43 ) . Association is far below the diffusion limit for encounter ( 45 ) and limited by filament shape fluctuations ( 45 , 46 ) , suggesting opportunistic binding to compliant filament segments ( 45 ) . Severing occurs preferentially at or near bound - aries ( e . g . junctions ) between bare and cofilin - decorated seg - ments ( 47 ) , explaining why the severing activity peaks when filaments are partially decorated ( 31 , 43 , 47 – 51 ) . Multiple factors likely influence the severing activity of ADF / cofilin , and the contributions of some have yet to be fully resolved . Cofilin alters filament twist ( 52 ) and subunit tilt ( 53 ) , renders filaments more compliant in bending ( 54 ) and twisting ( 55 , 56 ) by dissociating filament - associated stiffness cations ( 31 ) , and binds filaments in at least two distinct binding modes that may be differentially associated with severing and / or depolymerization activities ( 44 ) . Thermally driven severing ( e . g . in the absence of applied external loads ) is weak and presum - ably dominated by thermodynamic effects originating from structural phase discontinuities at boundaries between bare and decorated segments . Boundaries fragment at smaller defor - mations than either parent filament ( 50 ) , suggesting that boundaries are “bad joints” that are susceptible to fragmenta - tion , analogous to the interfacial fracture of some non - protein materials ( 12 ) . Srv2 / CAP ( cyclase - associated protein ) may enhance severing by cofilin by inducing further conformational changes at boundaries ( 57 ) . It is also conceivable that cofilin at the end of a bound cluster ( 43 , 44 ) preferentially adopts a dis - tinct binding mode ( e . g . “severing” ) from cofilin within a cluster ( e . g . “non - severing” ) . However , a correlation between filament dynamics and thermally driven fragmentation has also been observed ( 31 , 49 , 50 , 58 ) , suggesting that filament mechanics and the structural dynamics at boundaries can potentially play a role , even in the absence of external load . An attractive model ( 53 ) implicates allosteric propagation of cofilin - linked confor - mational changes ( 47 , 55 , 59 ) to bare , undecorated segments where local , stabilizing cofilin - actin interactions are absent , thus leading to fragmentation within the bare side of boundaries . Actin - interacting protein 1 ( Aip1 ( 60 ) ) accelerates the fila - ment - severing activity of cofilin . One model of enhanced sev - ering ( 61 ) implicates further structural changes in cofilin - actin induced by Aip1 , possibly a wedge - like mechanism where cofi - lin is inserted between adjacent long - axis neighbors . Consistent with a functional ternary Aip1 - cofilin - actin complex , Aip1 does not dissociate cofilin and enhances severing at all cofilin occu - pancies ( 62 ) . However , a different study ( 63 ) favors an alternate mechanism ( 64 ) in which Aip1 simply competes with cofilin , dissociating it from actin and introducing additional boundar - ies where severing can occur . The various factors contributing to filament severing may play different roles under cellular conditions . For example , active forces generated by contractile proteins may play a more dominant role ( 8 , 11 , 12 ) . The mechanical properties and response of filaments are central to understanding fragmenta - tion in this context because the mechanical heterogeneity and discontinuities introduced by cofilin will lead to unique behav - iors that deviate from mechanically homogenous , bare actin filaments ( 40 ) . Similarly , confinement within the elastic matrix of the cytoplasm ( 65 ) will influence the deformation and pre - sumably fragmentation . Control over Actin Network and Bundle Architecture Actin cross - linking and bundling proteins assemble fila - ments into larger scale networks and bundles .

Cross - linking proteins can vary con - siderably in their affinity , compliance , and distance between actin binding sites . Smaller cross - linkers ( e . g . fascin and fim - brin ) form compact bundles , whereas larger , more compliant cross - linkers ( e . g . filamin and (cid:4) - actinin ) form loose bundles or “mesh - like” networks . Most cross - linkers exhibit both behav - iors with the tendency to form at high cross - linker concentra - tions . When a stress is applied to an actin network or bundle , the deformations and dynamics of filaments and actin cross - linking proteins determine the mechanical response . In gen - eral , this mechanical response will , in some circumstances , behave like an elastic solid , and in others , it will behave like a viscous fluid . Thus , actin networks can be considered viscoelas - tic in their mechanical response . The architecture of cross - linked actin networks is deter - mined both by filament assembly dynamics ( rate of nucleation , growth , and severing ) and by factors controlling cross - linking ( cross - link kinetics and concentration ) and actin filament con - centration and length ( 66 , 67 ) . In the absence of cross - linkers , assembled filaments display a homogeneous distribution with a relatively uniform average distance between filaments ( termed the “mesh size” ) . Filaments longer than the mesh size are steri - cally entangled in the network . Steric entanglements constrain filament motions and , consequently , give rise to viscoelastic behavior ( 68 , 69 ) . Steric entanglements also prevent realign - ment of filaments into bundles ( 66 ) . Thus , the architecture of cross - linked networks is determined by competing timescales of bundle formation and the arrested mobility that occurs with entanglement . For a given cross - link type and density , fast growing filaments form fine meshworks , whereas slowly elon - gating filaments form networks of dense bundles ( 70 ) . Thus , architecture of cross - linked actin network is kinetically deter - mined , reflecting an arrested or kinetically “trapped” state rather than the lowest energy state defined by true thermody - namic equilibrium ( 66 , 71 ) . As a result , the actin cytoskeletal architectures found within living cells will exist in a dynamic steady state determined by a balance of filament assembly and disassembly dynamics and regulatory protein interactions . These microscopic rates , as discussed above , may also be force - regulated . Actin Network Mechanics The mechanical properties of the actin networks will deter - mine the extent and pattern of deformation in response to mechanical stress . The type of response will depend on the spatial scale , direction , duration , and magnitude of the applied stress . For example , at the scale of a single bundle or filament , the mechanics can be dominated by the local compressional , stretching , or bending rigidity of the filament / bundle depend - ing on the direction of the applied force . At longer length scales , the mechanical response is dominated both by the mechanics of individual elements as well as by how the filaments / bundles are connected together . Thus , actin network architecture deter - mines the mechanical properties of the elements as well as which types of microscopic deformations occur in response to a macroscopic stress . Below , we describe two regimes that dom - inate actin network mechanics . In filament networks or bundles that are densely cross - linked , the deformations are self - similar , or affine , from micro - scopic to macroscopic length scales . For shear or extensional stress , this results in a mechanical response that is domi - nated by stretching of filaments or bundles ( Fig . 4 A ) . The relationship between the stress ( force per unit area ) and strain ( relative deformation ) provides a measure of elastic modulus . The elastic modulus has units of energy per volume and can be thought of as the amount of energy required to deform the medium . The elastic modulus of filament net - works is determined both by the actin filament / bundle con - centration and the stretching and / or by the bending modu - lus of the filament / bundle itself . Thus , factors that affect the stretching / bending modulus of the filament or bundle ( e . g . time scales and applied stress ) will directly impact the mac - roscopic mechanical response . Indeed , the nonlinearity of the extensional spring constant of actin filaments can directly manifest into a nonlinear stiffening of cross - linked networks in response to stresses applied externally ( 72 , 73 ) or generated internally ( e . g . by myosin motors ) ( 74 ) . Strain stiffening in networks composed of linearly elastic fila - ments / bundles can also arise from geometric effects ( 75 , 76 ) . As the cross - link or filament density is reduced , the sparse connectivity within the network results in deformations that are not self - similar ( non - affine ) from microscopic to macro - scopic length scales . For instance , shear deformation at the macroscopic length scale generates filament bending , with a small fraction of filaments / bundles bearing the majority of the stress . Here the bending - dominated response at the micro - scopic scale results in softening of the network at macroscopic scale .

Energy dis - sipation arises over a broad range of time scales , ranging from filament fluctuations at high frequencies to cross - link unbind - ing / unfolding and filament turnover at long time scales . Energy dissipation results in the networks behaving like a fluid , whereby applied stress results in a constant rate of deformation ( strain rate ) and the ratio determines the viscosity . Experiments of stabilized filaments with dynamic cross - links yield viscoelas - ticity over a large range of time scales , with approximately equal contributions of elasticity and viscosity to the mechanical response . However , it is still uncertain whether networks formed with dynamic filaments could be well approximated as a fluid . Recent simulations suggest that this may be the case ( 77 ) as models of actin as a viscous fluid appear to perform reason - ably well in recapitulating observed flows in cells ( 78 ) . Mechanochemical Feedback in Dynamic Steady States The response of actin filaments and associated binding pro - teins to applied stress provides a natural mechanism to modify the large - scale network architecture in response to externally applied or internally generated stresses . For actin networks that are in a dynamic steady state with polymer disassembly / assem - bly , forces that alter the local rate of filament stability ( disas - sembly ) , assembly , or binding of actin - binding proteins will induce a transition to a new dynamic steady state . Although the experimental characterization of such mechanochemically responsive actin networks is still in its nascent stages , recent data suggest that distinct modules may differentiate branched versus contractile networks in response to stress . The filament binding affinity of the Arp2 / 3 complex depends on the filament curvature ( 79 ) , raising the possibility that a branched network exhibiting a compressive load could respond both by modulating the branch density and possibly by cofilin - mediated severing and filament subunit exchange . Together , this will increase the branch density and decrease average fila - ment length , resulting in increased force generation network stiffness as a result of the applied load . In contractile networks containing actin and myosin II fila - ments , network contraction arises from filament bending and buckling ( 9 ) . This results in a preferential severing of com - pressed , buckled filaments , thereby altering the local filament end density . In the presence of barbed end capping proteins , this could result in local disassembly from the pointed end , whereby in the presence of barbed end elongation factors , this would result in enhanced assembly . Unraveling how these mechanochemical feedbacks can be used to achieve the dynamic steady states observed in cells and enable cell mecha - nosensing will be an exciting area of future study .
