To study the role of ezrin in breast cancer , we ﬁrst assessed ezrin expression in a panel of breast cancer cell lines by western blot and confocal microscopy . Western blot revealed no diﬀerences in total ezrin levels among these breast cell lines . However , immunoﬂuorescence staining revealed that Estrogen receptor ( ER ) - positive , noninvasive and nontumorigenic cell lines concentrated ezrin at the apical surface , whereas invasive cell lines localized ezrin in motile structures ( membrane ruﬄes and ﬁlopodia ) but also had more diﬀuse cytoplasmic staining . We next studied ezrin expression in 509 breast carcinomas using tissue microarrays . Immunohistochemical staining for ezrin , p53 , Ki - 67 , phospho - Akt , HER2 , and hormonal receptors was performed . Ezrin staining in normal breast epithelium localized at the apical , but not lateral , cell surface , whereas , in most breast tumor cases ( 331 , 70 . 3 % ) , it localized in the cytoplasm . Complete membranous staining occurred in 89 ( 18 . 9 % ) samples , and apical staining was seen in 51 ( 10 . 8 % ) cases . There were signiﬁcant positive associations between cytoplasmic ezrin localization and adverse tumor characteristics such as high grade , high level of Ki - 67 expression , hormonal - receptor negativity , and lymph - node metastases . Apical ezrin staining was associated with favorable clinicopathological features and node - negative tumors . Membranous ezrin staining was associated with high grade , strong HER2 and p - Akt expression . In con - clusion , the switch of ezrin localization from the apical membrane to either the complete membrane or to the cytoplasm is correlated with dediﬀerentiation and adverse features in invasive breast tumors and cancer cell lines . Introduction Proteins of the ERM ( ezrin – radixin – moesin ) family are involved in the formation of cell - surface structures such as microvilli and membrane ruﬄes [ 1 ] . ERM proteins organize specialized cell - membrane domains by linking the actin cytoskeleton to a variety of membrane - associated proteins , such as the CD44 and ICAMs adhesion molecules , among others [ 2 ] . Moreover , ERM proteins play a role in growth - factor receptor signaling [ 3 ] , the regulation of Rho GTPases and cytoskeleton [ 4 ] , intercellular adhesion [ 5 , 6 ] , and cell - extracellular matrix communications [ 7 ] . Ezrin , the best - characterized ERM protein , is expressed in a variety of tissues , and typically concentrates at the apical surface of polarized epithelia [ 8 ] . Ezrin regulates a variety of cell - signaling pathways , including the PI - 3 - kinase / Akt pathway , which leads to Akt phosphorylation and promotes cell survival [ 9 ] . Similarly to other ERM proteins , ezrin function and localization are regulated by serine / threonine and tyro - sine phosphorylation [ 10 ] . An increasing amount of evi - dence has implicated ERM proteins in tumorigenesis ( reviewed in references 11 – 13 ) . Merlin , a protein closely related to those of the ERM family , is encoded by the neuroﬁbromatosis type II ( NF2 ) tumor - suppressor gene [ 12 ] . Moreover , a tumor - suppressor role has been sug - gested for moesin and radixin [ 11 – 13 ] . By contrast , ezrin was proposed as playing a positive role in tumorigenesis . Ezrin upregulation has been involved in the proliferation and immortalization of ﬁbroblasts [ 14 ] , the acquisition of an invasive phenotype in transformed esophageal epi - thelial cells [ 15 ] , and endometrial cancer cells [ 16 ] . In addition , ezrin overexpression correlates with the meta - static potential in various tumor types , such as osteosar - coma [ 17 , 18 ] , rhabdomyosarcoma [ 19 ] , and carcinomas of the pancreas [ 20 ] , ovary [ 21 ] , and endometrium [ 22 ] . Breast Cancer Research and Treatment ( 2006 ) 98 : 71 – 79 (cid:1) Springer 2006 DOI 10 . 1007 / s10549 - 005 - 9133 - 4 To assess the involvement of ezrin expression in human breast cancer , we analyzed ezrin expression in a panel of breast cancer cell lines . Moreover , we con - ducted a tissue - microarray - based immunohistochemical study in a series of 509 breast carcinomas and studied the correlation between ezrin immunostaining and a range of clinicopathological parameters . Material and methods Cell culture We used a panel of eight breast cell lines , including six breast cancer cell lines , a nonmalignant mammary epi - thelial cell line ( MCF10A ) and a cell line established from human breast milk ( HBL - 100 ) . MCF7 , MCF10A , T47D , MDA - MB - 231 , MDA - MB - 435S , and CAMA1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) . HBL - 100 and BT549 cell lines were a generous gift from Amancio Carnero ( Experimental Therapeutics Programme , CNIO ) . All cell lines were routinely grown in a humidiﬁed 5 % CO 2 atmosphere at 37 (cid:2) C , using the media and culture conditions recom - mended by the ATCC ( www . atcc . org ) . Media , sera and culture supplements were all purchased from Invitrogen Life Technologies , with the exception of MBDC med - ium , which was purchased from Sigma - Aldrich . Immunoﬂuorescence and confocal microscopy analysis For immunoﬂuorescence experiments , cells were plated onto sterile 12 - mm glass coverslips , and allowed to adhere for 24 h . They were then ﬁxed in 3 . 7 % formal - dehyde at room temperature for 30 min , and subse - quently permeabilized in 0 . 05 % Triton X - 100 PBS . Cells were blocked in 5 % bovine serum albumin - PBS and then incubated with the 3C12 primary antibody at 1 : 1000 dilution . The secondary antibody , Alexa - 488 - coupled anti - mouse Ig ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) , was applied at 1 : 100 dilution . The Alexa - 594 - coupled phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) was used to stain actin cytoskeleton . Cell nuclei were stained using 4 , 6 - dia - minidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) ( Molecular Probes ) . Staining was examined using a confocal ultra - spectral - microscope ( TCS - SP - 2 - AOBS - UV , Leica , Wetzlar , Germany ) . Post - capture image analysis and processing of confocal image stacks were performed using the Leica Confocal software . Western blot Cells were grown to conﬂuence on culture dishes , and lysed in ice - cold standard RIPA buﬀer . Lysates were centrifuged at 14 , 000 rpm for 15 min at 4 (cid:2) C , and pro - teins were obtained . Protein concentration was determined by the BCA protein assay ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) , and equal amounts were loaded in 6 % SDS - PAGE gels . Polypeptides were transferred onto Immobilon - P ( Millipore , Bedford , MA ) nitrocellulose membranes , and nonspeciﬁc binding was blocked with 5 % nonfat dry milk . Blots were then incubated with the 3C12 antibody ( 1 : 4000 dilution ) or alpha - tubulin ( 1 : 10 . 000 ) for 1 h . After extensive washes , anti - mouse Ig HRP - conjugated secondary antibody ( Amersham , Bucking - hamshire , UK ) was then applied ( 1 : 1000 dilution ) , and visualized using the ECL chemiluminescence detection kit ( Amersham Biosciences , Uppsala , Sweden ) . Tissue samples and tissue microarray construction This study comprised 509 breast cancer patients from La Paz Hospital ( Madrid , Spain ) who underwent surgery between 1993 and 2001 . The patients were randomly selected , and their formalin - ﬁxed , paraﬃn - embedded breast cancer specimens were acquired from the archives of the Pathology Department of La Paz Hospital . The mean patient age at surgery was 53 years ( range , 27 – 87 years ) . The series included 478 invasive ductal car - cinomas and 31 inﬁltrating lobular carcinomas . About 15 . 1 % of the tumors were grade I , 40 . 1 % were grade II , and 44 . 8 % were grade III . About 55 % of the tumors showed axillary lymph node metastasis at the time of diagnosis . Representative areas of the inﬁltrating carci - nomas were carefully selected on H & E - stained sections , and two 1 - mm diameter tissue cores were obtained from each specimen . The cores were precisely arrayed into a new paraﬃn block using a tissue microarray worksta - tion ( Beecher Instruments , Silver Spring , MD ) , essen - tially as previously described [ 23 ] . Immunohistochemistry and scoring Ezrin was immunohistochemically stained by the Envi - sion ( Dako , Glostrup , Denmark ) method with a heat - induced antigen - retrieval step . Sections from the tissue arrays were immersed in boiling 10 mM sodium citrate at pH 6 . 5 for 2 min in a pressure cooker . The mouse monoclonal antibody 3C12 ( from Sigma ) , raised against the carboxyterminal part of ezrin , was used at 1 : 5000 dilution . It detects a single 80 - kDa band in immuno - blotting , does not crossreact with moesin and radixin , and has been widely used with paraﬃn - embedded tissues [ 22 , 24 – 27 ] . Three pathologists ( SMR , JP , AD ) simulta - neously evaluated ezrin immunohistochemistry and a consensus was reached . Ezrin localization was scored as apical membrane , generally membranous , or cytoplas - mic , depending on the predominant expression pattern . Antibodies against p53 ( Novocastra ) , HER - 2 ( DAKO ) , Ki - 67 ( DAKO ) , Ser473 - phosphorylated Akt ( Cell Sig - naling ) , estrogen receptor alpha ( Novocastra ) , and progesterone receptor ( Novocastra ) , were applied at dilutions of 1 : 50 , 1 : 2000 , 1 : 30 , 1 : 100 , 1 : 30 and 1 : 30 , respectively , using the immunohistochemical methods described previously [ 28 ] . Cases were considered positive for hormonal receptors when any tumor cell was stained , or p53 when more than 30 % cells were stained . Ki - 67 expression was deﬁned as ‘‘low’’ when fewer than 72 D . Sarrio´ et al . 15 % of the cells were stained . HER2 was evaluated according to the four - category ( 0 – 3 + ) DAKO system proposed for the evaluation of Herceptest ; only a + 3 score was considered to indicate positive HER2 expression . For p - Akt , a tumor was considered positive when the brown color observed in tumoral cells was strong and clearly diﬀerent from that of the negative control . All studied TMAs also included normal breast tissue as an internal control . The primary antibodies were omitted in negative controls . Statistical analysis Contingency test with Yates correction or Fisher’s exact tests , and Student’s t - tests were performed to determine the statistical signiﬁcance of the relationships between the variables analyzed . The criterion for statistical sig - niﬁcance was p < 0 . 05 . SPSS 12 . 0 for Windows ( SPSS , Inc . , Chicago , IL ) was used for all analyses . Results Diﬀerential ezrin localization , rather than total ezrin protein levels , is associated with malignant characteristics in breast cancer cell lines Since ezrin overexpression has been linked with in - creased invasion and metastatic potential of pancreatic cancer cell lines [ 20 ] , we ﬁrst measured ezrin expression in cancer and nontumoral cell lines from breast . Western blot yielded no clear diﬀerences in the total levels of ezrin protein among the cell lines studied ( Figure 1 ) . However , using immunoﬂuorescence staining and con - focal microscope imaging , we observed important dif - ferences in ezrin distribution ( Figure 2 ) . Based on DAPI ( DNA marker ) staining , we selected various microscopic ﬁelds with cells showing no apoptotic or mitotic fea - tures . Therefore , the staining patterns shown in Figure 2 are representative of the general ezrin localization in each cell line . Interestingly , associations were observed between ezrin localization and ER status , invasion ability and tumorigenicity in these cell lines ( Table 1 ) . In the two ER - positive , and noninvasive cell lines ( MCF7 and T47D ) , ezrin localized in cell - surface microvilli , which formed concentrated groups at the apical cell surface , thereby giving ezrin a polarized ( basal - apical ) distribution ( Figure 2a , b ) . By contrast , in the highly invasive and tumorigenic cell lines , ezrin staining was especially evident in motile structures , such as mem - brane ruﬄes ( MDAMB231 and 435S cells ) or ﬁlopodia ( BT549 ) , which were highly enriched in actin protein ( Figure 2d , e ) . The distribution of microvilli on the cell membrane was homogeneous with no apical polariza - tion . A signiﬁcant proportion of ezrin was diﬀusely distributed within the cell cytoplasm of these cells . In CAMA1 cells , ezrin was found with actin in microvilli and ﬁlopodia throughout the entire cell membrane , including the cell – cell boundaries ( Figure 2c ) . No cyto - plasmic staining of ezrin was observed in this cell line . Ezrin was heterogeneously distributed in the nontu - moral mammary cells ( MCF10A and HBL100 ) . HBL100 cells showed ezrin localization in large ﬁlopo - dia and in the cytoplasm , thus resembling the ezrin pattern observed in the highly motile cancer cells ( Fig - ure 2f ) . Ezrin localization in MCF10A was highly dependent on cell conﬂuence ( not shown ) . In sparse cultured cells , most ezrin localized in short ﬁlopodia and membranous microvilli , but not apical grouping was observed . In conﬂuent cells , ezrin localized throughout the entire membrane ( including cell – cell contacts ) and in the cytoplasm . Therefore , since these nontumoral cell lines are ER - negative and highly motile in vitro [ 29 , 30 ] , we concluded that only estrogen - dependent , noninva - sive , well - diﬀerentiated breast cancer cell lines showed strong polarization of ezrin - containing microvilli towards the apical membrane . Loss of ezrin apical localization in breast cancer cells is associated with adverse tumor characteristics To assess whether abnormal localization of ezrin oc - curred in human breast tumors , we studied 509 breast carcinomas by immunohistochemistry . In normal epi - thelial cells of healthy mammary ducts , ezrin staining was restricted to the apical ( luminal ) surface ( Figure 3a ) and was rarely observed at the lateral surface or , dif - fusely , in the cell cytoplasm . Normal epithelium showed highly variable ezrin staining intensity , ranging from a strong signal to one that was scarcely detectable . By contrast , ezrin immunoreactivity was detected in the tumoral cells of all breast cancer cases . Generally , breast tumors exhibited stronger ezrin staining intensity than did the adjacent normal breast epithelia ( when present ) , suggesting that ezrin was upregulated in tumor cells ( Figure 3e ) . In most breast tumors ( 331 out of 471 , 70 . 3 % ) , ezrin was exclusively localized in the cytoplasm ( Figure 3d , i ) . Staining throughout the complete cell membrane , together with some degree of cytoplasmic staining ( Figure 3c , h ) was observed in 89 cancer sam - ples ( 18 . 9 % ) . Only a small proportion of tumors ( 51 cases , 10 . 8 % ) showed ezrin expression restricted to the outer cell surface , in a way that resembles the apical staining observed in normal ducts ( Figure 3b , g ) . Moreover , intense nuclear staining was observed in a small subset of the tumors ( 14 cases , 3 . 0 % ) ( Figure 3e ) . Figure 1 .

We next established that apical ezrin staining was clearly associated with favorable tumor features ( see Table 2 ) , such as low grade , low Ki - 67 proliferation index , estrogen - and progesterone - receptor positivity ( Fig - ure 3g , j ) , HER2 negativity and lower frequency of lymph - node metastasis . By contrast , cytoplasmic ezrin localization was frequently observed in high - grade , hormonal receptor - negative , highly proliferative ( Fig - ure 3i , l ) , and node - positive tumors ( Table 2 ) . Mem - branous ezrin localization associated with high grade , expression of phosphorylated Akt ( p - Akt ) ( Figure 3f ) and HER2 overexpression ( Figure 3h , k ) . Compared to apical - ezrin tumors , membranous ezrin staining was more frequent in p53 - positive , and Ki67 - positive tumors . No signiﬁcant association was observed be - tween ezrin localization and tumor histology or patient age . Discussion Increasing evidence indicates that the membrane - cyto - skeleton linker ezrin is directly linked with malignant progression in a variety of human neoplasias ( reviewed in references 11 – 13 ) . However , downregulation or over - expression of ezrin have both been associated with unfavorable tumor characteristics and patient survival in some tumor types [ 24 – 27 ] . Several studies have shown that overexpression of ezrin is associated with malignant transformation , increased proliferation , cell survival , motility , and metastatic ability in some tumor types and cancer models [ 14 – 22 , 27 ] . In breast carcinoma cells , ezrin expression has been shown to be required for metastasis , but overexpression of ezrin alone was not suﬃcient to induce metastasis in that tumor model [ 31 ] . The dis - crepancy between these studies may be partly due to methodological diﬀerences but , more probably , it reﬂects the diﬀerential in vivo functions of ezrin among the tissue and tumor types analyzed . It is worth noting that many studies assessed ezrin expression by considering total ezrin protein levels but not its subcellular localization . Here we have observed that total ezrin protein levels did not diﬀer between invasive and noninvasive breast cancer cell lines , but ezrin localization did . The polarized concentration of ezrin in the microvilli of the apical cell surface was characteristic of ER - positive , noninvasive and nontumorigenic cell lines , whereas ezrin enrichment in motile structures ( membrane ruﬄes and ﬁlopodia ) and / or cytoplasmic accumulation was particularly evi - dent in invasive and / or ER - negative cells . Moreover , we present here the ﬁrst immunohisto - chemical study of ezrin in breast cancer cases . Ezrin was restricted to the apical ( luminal ) membrane of normal breast epithelial cells , but its staining intensity was highly variable . Breast tumor cells always expressed ezrin , and generally showed stronger ezrin immunoreactivity than did the adjacent normal ductal epithelia , suggesting that there is ezrin upregulation in breast carcinogenesis . However , due to the heterogeneous ezrin expression pattern within the tumors , and the lack of normal breast tissue in all of the analyzed tissue cores ( by comparison ) , we were unable to perform a quantitative analysis of ezrin levels in the tumors . Nonetheless , consistent with our observations in breast cancer cell lines , we demon - strated that apical ezrin staining was associated with well - diﬀerentiated , hormonal - receptor - positive , low - proliferative and node - negative tumors . Consis - tently with this , loss of ezrin from the apical surface of the tumors is associated with adverse tumor variables and patient survival in lung and ovarian cancers [ 24 – 32 ] . The fact that apical ezrin correlated with ER positivity in both tumors and cell lines implies that ezrin expression is regulated by hormones . Accordingly , ezrin and its binding partners are diﬀerentially modulated in hor - mone - responsive tissues [ 33 ] and ezrin is directly upreg - ulated by estrogens in ovarian cancer cells [ 34 ] and in the uterus of juvenile rats [ 33 ] . Taken together , these data suggest that the proper expression of ezrin , and probably of other ERM proteins , may be associated with ER function in breast tissue . For instance , the level of moesin mRNA was reported to be lower in ER - positive than in ER - negative breast tumors and cancer cell lines [ 35 ] . In addition , ezrin cytoplasmic localization , which was the most frequent pattern in breast carcinomas , associ - ated with unfavorable clinicopathological features such as higher grade , high Ki - 67 index , ER and PR negativity Table 1 .

Ezrin expression in breast cancer 75 and the presence of lymph - node metastasis . It is worth noting that localization of ezrin within the cells has important functional consequences . Cytosolic ezrin is thought to exist in a folded ( dormant ) monomeric conformation that is unable to associate with membra - nous proteins and actin microﬁlaments [ 36 ] . Cytosolic ezrin is therefore considered to be ‘‘inactive’’ . Impor - tantly , cytoplasmic localization of ezrin occurs in a Figure 3 .

Sarrio´ et al . variety of human tumors , such as anaplastic astrocyto - mas [ 26 ] , and carcinomas of the ovary [ 24 ] , prostate [ 25 ] , and lung [ 32 ] , but not in the normal tissues from which these tumors originate . This therefore suggests that cytosolic ezrin localization may provoke dysfunction in ezrin - mediated cellular processes . Following stimulation by external growth factors , ezrin is phosphorylated , giving an open conformation that is able to bind to actin and transmembrane receptors [ 37 ] . Redistribution of ezrin from cytosol to microvilli and membrane ruﬄes has been demonstrated in a variety of cancer cell lines when treated with growth factors [ 38 , 39 ] . The increase in such ezrin - rich cell membrane structures ( ruﬄes , ﬁlopodia ) has been associated with enhanced invasion , migration , and proliferation in vitro [ 21 ] . Thus , in uterine carcino - mas , ezrin was mainly membranous in the cancer cells that metastasized to the lymph node [ 22 ] . We observed here that approximately 20 % of breast tumors showed ezrin staining throughout the entire cell membrane ( i . e . , it was not restricted to the apical surface ) . In these tu - mors , ezrin is probably associated at the membrane with surface structures promoting motility ( as occurs in the highly invasive 231 , 435S , and CAMA1 cell lines ) and / or mediating growth - factor - receptor signaling . Accordingly , membranous ezrin showed the strongest immunohistochemical expression of phosphorylated Akt and HER2 overexpression . The association in the cell membrane of ezrin with PI3 - kinase is known to be nec - essary for Akt - mediated cell survival in kidney - derived cells [ 9 ] , and activation of Akt pathway occurs during ezrin - mediated cell motility in mouse breast cancer cells [ 31 ] . Moreover , an association between activated HER2 , Akt , and ezrin has been reported in murine breast car - cinoma cells [ 40 ] . Recently , activated Akt has been demonstrated to occur preferably in HER2 positive breast tumors [ 41 ] . Thus , since HER2 and activated Akt are generally considered markers of poor prognosis [ 41 ] , membranous ezrin would correlate with adverse tumor characteristics . In our series , this was true for some clinicopathological variables , such as high grade , p53 and Ki - 67 positivity but not for increased lymph - node metastasis . Nonetheless , it should be noted that mem - branous - ezrin tumors were mostly ER - positive , and that some reports correlated p - Akt with favorable tumor variables such as lower grade , ER positivity and a low Nottingham prognostic index [ 42 ] . In conclusion , loss of ezrin apical polarization may have functional relevance in breast cancer cells . Table 2 .

Ezrin expression in breast cancer 77 Abnormal localization of ezrin within the cells , such as in the cytosolic compartment , may cause the loss of normal anchorage to the membrane of a variety of adhesion molecules or growth - factor receptors . Ezrin localization throughout the complete cell membrane may promote the activation of oncogenic intracellular signaling pathways and alter intercellular adhesion . As a result , loss of apical ezrin localization may disturb the maintenance of a polarized and diﬀerentiated phenotype and promote the acquisition of an aggressive and met - astatic phenotype .
