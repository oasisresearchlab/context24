What enables such blends to earn approval and become recognized as new categories ? We argue that reactions to category blending are affected by both micro and macro factors . Speciﬁcally , blend reactions are affected at the micro level by cognitive limits , especially as blends are repeated , and at the macro level by domain - speciﬁc logics for judging quality . Using data on nanotechnology patents , we test this argument by analyzing two dimensions of approval : time to approval and citations by subsequent patents . In addition to showing that blending has different effects on these two dimensions of approval , our ﬁndings suggest that reactions to blending are moderated , as argued , by ( 1 ) institutional logics that value novel combinations and ( 2 ) the repetition of blends that came to deﬁne nanotechnology . Our study contributes to theory by linking approval of category blends to cognitive limitations and cultural and institutional logics of evaluation .

Introduction Building on what Zuckerman ( 1999 ) called the “illegiti - macy discount , ” a considerable literature on categories in organization studies shows that people tend to overlook and undervalue market offerings that seem to fall between categories rather than clearly ﬁtting a single category of demand that is already well understood ( Hsu et al . 2010 ) . In spite of this potent dynamic , new categories often emerge around inventions that recombine elements of multiple areas of knowledge or expertise . In technology , for example , smartphones combine mobile telephony with elements of digital cameras , personal organizers , and game players . In the world of scientiﬁc research and development , nanotechnology emerged from work that drew on disciplines such as physics , chemistry , materi - als science , and various ﬁelds of engineering . Inspired by the nanotechnology case , this research asks , what enables such a blend of categories to earn approval and be recognized as a new category ? To address this question , we turn to two complemen - tary ideas in organization theory . First , the evolution of institutional theory ( DiMaggio and Powell 1983 ) focuses on institutional logics ( Friedland and Alford 1991 ) , the formal and informal rules about what counts as appropri - ate “action , interaction , and interpretation” in particular settings ( Thornton and Ocasio 1999 , p . 804 ) . Institutional logics theoretically affect reactions to category blends because , as Armstrong ( 2002 , p . 362 ) argues , logics can lay a foundation for “contexts of collective creativity , ” or social settings where diverse perspectives combine with intense interactions and uncertainty to alter the usual negative reactions to new ideas . Applying this idea to the emergence of new organizational forms , King et al . ( 2011 ) argue that new forms are more likely to emerge in contexts where alternative concepts for organizing are more readily available . This idea elaborates political and cultural approaches to institutions that link change to contexts in which diverse perspectives are more or less cognitively available or salient ( Clemens and Cook 1999 ; DiMaggio 1997 , 1988 ; Fligstein 1996 , 2001 ) . Second , there is the idea that the growing prevalence of new types of organizations reﬂects ﬁtness with organiza - tional environments ( Carroll and Hannan 1989 , Tolbert and Zucker 1983 ) . In the ecological literature on organizational forms ( Bogaert et al . 2010 , Hannan and Freeman 1986 , McKendrick et al . 2003 , Pólos et al . 2002 , Romanelli 1991 , Ruef 2000 ) , negative reactions to category blends are explained not only by the importance of ﬁtting preva - lent categories but also by the principle of allocation , a thesis that states that organizations trying to ﬁt multiple niches will make trade - offs that make them less well suited to the demands of any single niche ( Hsu 2006a ) . Indirectly , Zuckerman’s ( 1999 ) categorical imperative supports elements of the principle of allocation : if an 1 D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 240 . 225 . 44 ] on 21 D ece m b e r 2014 , a t 23 : 57 .

Lo and Kennedy : Micro and Macro Factors That Affect Reactions to Category Blending 2 Organization Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 21 , ©2014 INFORMS organizational form or practice blends elements of multi - ple categories , it is less likely to be recognized , let alone be adopted so that it spreads and becomes prevalent . And yet new things can and do emerge as distinct categories of their own , and gaining recognition as a new category requires some combination of widely appreci - ated differentiation and importance . Prevalence plays a role in this process because , from social psychological studies of categorization , we know that making sense of uncategorized items taxes cognitive limitations ( Rosch and Lloyd 1978 ) , and this creates pressures to categorize such items , especially when they are growing in number and therefore also encountered more often . Hence , the ecology of categories , if you will , suggests that diffusing category blends beg categorization that eases the work of counting and making sense of them ( Kennedy 2008 ) . These ideas lay the foundation for our thesis in this research : blend - friendly logics of evaluation combine with prevalence of speciﬁc blend patterns to alter reactions to blends . As we will argue , negative reactions to category blends are moderated and , in some cases , even reversed by institutional logics and repetition of certain blend patterns . In contexts such as the patent approval process , institutional logics for evaluating quality can be friendly to category blends , and such blend - friendly logics moder - ate the categorical imperative . Separately , the cognitive burdens of encountering a growing volume of particular category blends create pressures to recognize such blends as a new category . Moreover , logics and pattern repetition interact to further alter reactions to category blends . The rest of this paper unfolds as follows . To start , we develop the theory and hypotheses that relates blending to logics and repetition in the context of patent approval . Speciﬁcally , we relate logics and repetition to two dimen - sions of approval in the patenting context : how quickly patents are approved and how often they are cited by later patents . These two dimensions of approval are interesting because they separate initial approval of an invention from later acknowledgment by subsequent inventors . The nanotech context is also interesting for our purposes because nanotech emerged from inventions that blend many distinctly categorized areas of knowledge , or what the patent system calls “primary patent classes , ” but prior studies of category blending suggest that blending a larger number of patent classes should work against approval . Furthermore , the growth of nanotech was helped by the emergence of a new interdisciplinary logic of research evaluation . Following the theory and hypotheses , we then explain the nanotech patent data and the methods we used to compute key measures and test our hypotheses . After reporting the results , we then discuss the ﬁndings and the study’s implications for theory and practice . To sum - marize the conclusions we elaborate later , this paper makes two contributions to theory and practice . First , our results suggest that reactions to category blends differ when we examine initial and later approval separately , which we do by looking at time to approval and citations from later patents . Second , and more fundamentally , our study of approval in nanotechnology patents suggests reactions to category blending , which are usually negative , are moderated by institutional logics of evaluation that shape reactions to blends ; repetition of particular blend patterns that demand attention ; and a complex interaction between logic , repetition , and typicality with repeated patterns . Overall , our paper shows that blends that seem ungainly at ﬁrst may appear more natural later , especially with changes to logics that dictate how blends will be evaluated . Theory Category - blending offerings face generally negative reac - tions from market audiences because they incur the illegitimacy discount mentioned above ( Zuckerman 1999 ) . This discount reﬂects the isomorphic pressures exerted by institutions , which the literature deﬁnes as durable rules , structures , and patterns that establish what counts as legitimate in society ( DiMaggio and Powell 1983 , Jepperson 1991 , Scott 2008 ) . More speciﬁcally , institu - tions pose constraints on category - blending innovations by rewarding conformity with established categories and creating sanctions for things that fall outside them . For example , eBay sellers active in multiple categories are less likely to complete a sale ( Hsu et al . 2009 ) , and ﬁlms that span multiple genres receive lower ratings from critics ( Hsu 2006b ) . Before proceeding further , let us brieﬂy explain why we say “blending” multiple categories rather than “spanning” them , as a number of prior studies have done . In orga - nizational ecology , scholars combine the principle of allocation with the illegitimacy discount to argue and show that , ceteris paribus , organizations and market offerings face weaker demand when they try to ﬁt multiple demand niches , or categories , rather than ﬁtting one cleanly ( Hsu 2006a , b ; Hsu et al . 2009 ; Negro et al . 2010 ) . In this perspective , it makes sense to view multiple category membership as “spanning” because it reduces niche ﬁtness by complicating the task of developing capabilities suited to succeeding in any one demand environment ( Carroll and Swaminathan 2000 ) . According to Zuckerman’s ( 1999 ) categorical imperative , however , investors pay less for stocks when , all else equal , companies combine , or “blend , ” businesses in unfamiliar ways . Because such combinations tend to undermine analyst attention and appraisal , Zuckerman’s illegitimacy discount is rooted in the effects of categories as shared cognitive frameworks and , more fundamentally , in cognitive limits . And yet categories are both a response to and a reﬂec - tion of cognitive limits . Facing an inﬁnitude of varia - tion with ﬁnite cognitive resources ( Simon 1947 , 1974 ) , humans are cognitive misers ( see Fiske and Taylor 1991 ) , and categorization is a coping mechanism for distilling D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 240 . 225 . 44 ] on 21 D ece m b e r 2014 , a t 23 : 57 .

Lo and Kennedy : Micro and Macro Factors That Affect Reactions to Category Blending Organization Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 21 , ©2014 INFORMS 3 the variety of experience into a manageable catalogue of patterns worth naming ( Mervis and Rosch 1981 , Rosch and Lloyd 1978 ) . Although categorization is a response to individual cognitive limitations , categories themselves are a record of collective efforts at sensemaking ( Weick 1993 , 1995 ) —that is , the collective quest to make sense of patterns that are initially anomalous to existing classiﬁ - cation systems but eventually seen as important enough to name , remember , and pass on . Thus , we argue that reactions to category - blending inventions should reﬂect not only cognitive limits but also categorization as a response to these limits—that is , the process of recognizing and approving new blend patterns . Speciﬁcally , we consider two dimensions of approval . First , there is approval as appraisal , in which people use established categories to make sense of and evaluate objects that ﬁt them . 1 Because blends can be seen as members of multiple categories , it is harder to identify a clear reference point or comparison group , which complicates appraisal and evaluation . Second , there is approval as acknowledgment , in which people accept and acknowledge the relevance or signiﬁcance of an object . These two dimensions of approval go hand in hand in most cases : entities that cannot be properly classiﬁed and appraised are also less likely to be accepted or acknowledged as relevant by the audience ( Hsu et al . 2009 , Negro and Leung 2013 ) . However , there are situations in which this is not the case . In particular , reactions to category blends reﬂect context - dependent standards of worth that are socially constructed ( Berger and Luckmann 1966 ) . Appraisal of category blends may be difﬁcult in any context , but blends receive greater acknowledgment in contexts where prevailing norms favor novelty and originality . In the world of patenting , for example , patents that are broader in scope are harder to evaluate and hence generally take longer to appraise and approve , but such patents are also more likely to be widely cited—or acknowledged—as relevant by more subsequent inventors ( Austin 1993 , Fleming 2001 , Lerner 1994 , Trajtenberg et al . 1997 ) . Both types of approval are important to the fates of individual category - blending inventions and the process of recognizing similar blends as a category of their own . That is , previously uncategorized blends become new categories with approving appraisals and approving acknowledgments . Category blends are more likely to receive such approval in contexts such as the United States Patent and Technology Ofﬁce ( USPTO ) ; the dominant logic for evaluating worth encourages novel recombinations of existing categories . In such contexts , category - blending innovations are more likely to be acknowledged as potentially relevant or useful , even though they may not ( yet ) be easily classiﬁable . Furthermore , repetition of similar blends makes it harder to overlook them and therefore more likely they will be recognized as a new category ; this was the case with nanotech patents , around which we develop and test our theoretical argument . Category Blending and Context Contextual variation in openness to novel recombinations of existing categories is grounded in standards of worth woven into institutional logics , which are deﬁned as the assumptions , values , practices , beliefs , and rules about how to interpret reality , what constitutes appropriate behavior , and how to succeed ( Thornton and Ocasio 1999 , p . 804 ) . In the patent context , the goal of recognizing and protecting novel , nonobvious innovations dictates that patents cannot be given to inventions that are similar to what has been shown or used before . That is , the institu - tional logic of the USPTO patent review explicitly denies patents for inventions that conform too closely to the “prior art , ” a term the USPTO uses to refer to inventions and ideas that patents build on and extend . Though novel category blends should be more welcome in the patenting context than in many others , novelty goes hand in hand with unfamiliarity , a factor that complicates both aspects of approval—that is , appraisal and acknowledgment . Approval as Appraisal . According to the USPTO , the ﬁrst step in the patent review is to classify an invention so it can be assigned to an examiner with relevant expertise ( USPTO 2007 ) . When inventions do not ﬁt established categories , it is harder to ﬁnd qualiﬁed examiners—just as it was harder for Zuckerman’s ( 1999 ) misﬁt stocks to attract analysts . And when classiﬁcation is harder , the job of locating relevant prior art ( Sampat 2004 ) is also harder , which slows down review times . This occurred in the early days of patents for biotechnology , software , and business methods . 2 Beyond classiﬁcation and reviewer assignment , more - over , it is also more difﬁcult for examiners to properly evaluate the claims of inventions that build on multiple categories ( Koppikar et al . 2004 ) . In this context , the categorical imperative suggests it ought to be more time consuming to evaluate nanotechnology patents , especially when a patent draws on prior knowledge from multi - ple ﬁelds such as medicine , engineering , biotechnology , physical sciences , and information technology . In fact , understanding how cited classes relate to each other entails a set of pairwise comparisons that grows exponentially with the number of classes combined . Thus , because combining elements of multiple domains makes inventions harder to evaluate , we expect this to prolong the review process . The relationship between category blending and approval time is not a simple linear one , however , because humans cope with increasingly heavy cognitive burdens by various pattern recognition strategies ( Chaiken and Trope 1999 ) . As examiners confront category blends , therefore , we expect they will use these strategies to simplify blends according to patterns learned through prior relevant experience ( Chase and Simon 1973 , Gobet et al . 2004 ) . Thus , although blending elements of a larger number of categories makes it harder to evaluate whether D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 240 . 225 . 44 ] on 21 D ece m b e r 2014 , a t 23 : 57 .

Lo and Kennedy : Micro and Macro Factors That Affect Reactions to Category Blending 4 Organization Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 21 , ©2014 INFORMS and how the pieces ﬁt together , that job is eased if evalu - ators spot patterns they have seen before when analyzing ﬁt among an invention’s various elements . Combining the difﬁculties of reviewer assignment and claim evaluation with the possibility that blending a larger number of classes will push examiners to start chunking some classes together to ease the cognitive burdens of evaluation , we expect approval times—or pending time , as the USPTO refers to it—to increase with the number of classes a patent cites , but at a decreasing rate . Hypothesis 1 ( H1 ) . Ceteris paribus , the time to ap - proval increases with the number of patent classes that a patent builds on , although this effect diminishes as the number of classes continues to grow . Approval as Acknowledgment . Recall that approval of innovations includes both appraisal and acknowledgment . A useful indicator of acknowledgment in the patent context is forward citations , the number of times that a patent is cited by subsequent inventors in other patents . Because the USPTO requires all patent applications to cite the relevant prior art in developing their claims to novelty , subsequent ﬁlers’ citations to a patent reﬂect recognition of an invention’s relevance . All else being equal , the number of forward citations a focal patent receives measures how widely the patent is recognized as being important to subsequent inventions . In the literature of technology and innovation , it is conventional to use patent citations as proxy for the perceived value or technological importance of a patent ( Hall et al . 2005 , Jaffe 1986 , Jaffe et al . 1993 ) . In contrast to the categorical imperative and the princi - ple of allocation , theories about technology and innovation suggest there are beneﬁts to bridging multiple technology categories . Such inventions are typically considered more “basic , ” more general , or more original ( Lerner 1994 , Phene et al . 2006 ) . Moreover , patents that build on a larger number of patent classes also effectively build bridges between ﬁelds that can become pathways for visibility to a wider audience of subsequent inventors . From this perspective , inventions that blend multiple categories of knowledge should , on average , be discovered and cited more often than should patents that build on a narrower base of knowledge ( Lerner 1994 ) . Although this suggests citations to a patent will increase with the number of technology categories it blends , this beneﬁcial effect of blending is still subject to the cognitive limits responsible for the negative reactions to blending predicted by the categorical imperative . That is , the beneﬁcial effects of blending multiple categories should diminish because the number of categories also makes it increasingly difﬁcult to identify inventions that ought be acknowledged as relevant prior art . Given these competing effects of blend - ing , we expect diminishing returns to category blending . Increasing the number of categories blended ought to be associated with increased citations at lower levels of blending , but this effect will diminish at higher levels of blending . This leads to our second hypothesis . Hypothesis 2 ( H2 ) . Ceteris paribus , forward citations increase with the number of patent classes that a patent builds on , although this effect diminishes as the number of classes continues to grow . Blending and Institutional Logics of Evaluation Although the USPTO review process is relatively friendly to cross - domain innovations , receptivity to category - blending inventions is also affected by movement - like changes that shift institutional logics for value with disciplinary purity or drawing on multiple ﬁelds—as early nanotechnology patents did . For example , institutional logics in higher - education publishing shifted from deﬁning success and quality based on editorial judgment to taking a more market - based approach to deﬁning success in terms of sales , and this shift reﬂected and prompted changes in the kinds of executives in charge of publishing ﬁrms ( Thornton and Ocasio 1999 ) . Similarly , the ﬁnance industry saw new forms of thrift organizations emerge as the prevailing logic shifted to reﬂect Progressive Era values ( Haveman and Rao 1997 ) . As another example , ﬁnancial occupations became increasingly professionalized and offered new opportunities for lower - status actors as a regulatory logic was replaced by a market logic ( Lounsbury 2002 ) . Such a shift also occurred in the world of science and technology , and nanotechnology patents beneﬁted from it . Even in science , standards for judging novelty and “good science” have changed over time ( Chalmers 1999 , Menand 2010 ) . Historically , discipline - based research was the primary vehicle for making valued contribu - tions , but in the 1980s , scientiﬁc communities started to value research that draws on multiple intellectual streams ( Klein 1990 ) . Frustrated by the constraints posed by traditional discipline - based research programs , major funding agencies such as the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) and the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) started encouraging interdisciplinary research ( IDR ) efforts with increased funding through speciﬁc programs . As the IDR movement gained momentum in science and policy dis - courses , interdisciplinary collaborations attracted funding and became more prevalent in new ﬁelds such as neuro - science ( Toescu 2005 ) , biotechnology ( Powell et al . 1996 , 2005 ) , and nanotechnology ( Porter and Youtie 2009 ) . As the interdisciplinary rationale for linking creativity and cross - fertilization developed into a recognized recipe for originality ( Fleming 2001 , Trajtenberg et al . 1997 ) , interdisciplinary proposals gained greater attention and increased funding . With the increasing currency of this new interdisciplinary logic , patent examiners became more likely to view category blends as potential instances of this new style of research ; in turn , they also became more attuned to spotting recurring patterns in the repetition of similar blends . As examiners see more patents with longer class lists , they spot repeated patterns in class lists , making it easier to recognize blends as instances of new D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 240 . 225 . 44 ] on 21 D ece m b e r 2014 , a t 23 : 57 .

Lo and Kennedy : Micro and Macro Factors That Affect Reactions to Category Blending Organization Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 21 , ©2014 INFORMS 5 categories of research and development R & D and hence may reduce the approval time . This leads to the following hypothesis . Hypothesis 3 ( H3 ) . A growth in interdisciplinary logic will moderate the effect of blending on approval time so that , all else equal , as an IDR logic becomes more prevalent , the time to approval is shorter for patents building on a larger number of classes . A similar mechanism applies to subsequent inventors’ searches for the relevant prior art to cite . The emergence of an interdisciplinary logic therefore affects our hypothesis that building on a larger number of patent classes makes it harder for inventors to ﬁnd and cite a patent . Speciﬁcally , an interdisciplinary logic encourages inventors to make interdisciplinary connections in their own work and also cite prior inventions that are similarly interdisciplinary . That is , interdisciplinary norms should have similar effects on both the search for new ideas and the search for relevant prior art . Hence , emergence of an interdisciplinary logic should encourage inventors to recognize inventions that blend insights from multiple R & D areas , thereby easing the expected negative effects of building on multiple patent classes as the number of classes grows larger . Thus , we hypothesize the following . Hypothesis 4 ( H4 ) . A growth in interdisciplinary logic will moderate the effect of blending on forward citations so that , all else equal , as an IDR logic becomes more prevalent , forward citations are higher for patents building on a larger number of classes . Blending and Typicality Whereas recurring blends have the potential to become the building blocks of new categories , the mere availability of a new blend does not guarantee it will be recognized as a new category . In organizational ecology ( Carroll 1984 , Carroll and Hannan 1989 , Hannan and Freeman 1977 ) and institutional accounts of diffusion and innovation ( Tolbert and Zucker 1983 ) , the prevalence , or density , of new categories of organizations or practices is used as a crucial indicator of their legitimacy . The argument for linking prevalence to legitimacy is that growing numbers of a thing make it seem both less anomalous and more like a new population of organizations . This logic parallels psychological studies of catego - rization , which suggest that pattern recognition is one of the ﬁrst steps toward categorization ( Rosch 1999 ) . New cases that are similar to each other are more likely to be recognized as members of an emerging category when they are observed increasingly often ( Rosch 1983 ) . When previously unfamiliar patterns occur frequently enough , existing classiﬁcation systems fail to economize the cognitive workload of sensemaking , which creates pressures for revising existing categories or even creating new categories to reﬂect the observed patterns . Therefore , the more that new inventions build on a particular set of categories , the more likely that the elements of that set of categories will be recognized as a new category unto itself ( Rosch 1983 ) . Moreover , the more closely an erstwhile hybrid matches an emerging template for a nascent category , the more likely it is to be recognized as a member of the new category ( Rosch 1999 ) . This echoes Fleming’s ( 2001 ) ﬁnding that the use of familiar combinations reduces the technological uncertainty of an innovation . Thus , evaluating category combinations should become easier for experts such as patent examiners when they use patterns seen before in other inventions . As mentioned above , we expect examiners to cope with the cognitive demands of category blends by using repeated blends to treat patent classes as a group , or chunk , and this job should be easier when a particular blend resem - bles the typical conﬁguration of an emerging category . In nanotechnology , distinct patent class combinations underlie subthemes such as nano - bio , nano - materials , and nano - manipulation . Nano - bio combines ( 1 ) bio - affecting and body - treating drugs , or class 424 ; ( 2 ) molecular biology and microbiology , or class 435 ; ( 3 ) natural resins or derivatives , peptides or proteins , lignins , or reaction products thereof , or class 530 ; and ( 4 ) organic compounds , or class 636 . Nano - manipulation combines classes for dispensing , static information storage and retrieval , and agitating . Patents co - cite many nano - bio classes , but non - bio and nano - manipulation classes are co - cited much less often . When such combinations recur , they are easier to recognize as a case of something new , not just as anoma - lies . Such inferences streamline the search for prior art by making new combinations of prior art more cognitively available to evaluators . When inventions combine multiple categories of prior art , therefore , patents that resemble the emerging prototypes for new categories of nanotechnology should be easier to evaluate and acknowledge as their own new categories compared with those that do not portray such typicality . This leads to the following hypotheses of interactions between category blending and typicality . Hypothesis 5 ( H5 ) . Typicality will moderate the effect of blending on time to approval so that , all else equal , being typical of an emerging category will shorten approval time for patents building on a larger number of classes . Hypothesis 6 ( H6 ) . Typicality will moderate the effect of blending on forward citations so that , all else equal , being typical of an emerging category will increase forward citations for patents building on a large number of classes . Three - Way Interaction : Blending , Logics , and Typicality Finally , we expect patent approval to be subject to a three - way interaction between the number of categories D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 240 . 225 . 44 ] on 21 D ece m b e r 2014 , a t 23 : 57 .

Lo and Kennedy : Micro and Macro Factors That Affect Reactions to Category Blending 6 Organization Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 21 , ©2014 INFORMS being blended , a blend - friendly logic of evaluation , and typicality with blends recurring increasingly often . With the popularity of cross - disciplinary work and the emer - gence of nanotechnology as a new category , multiclass patents that resemble the attributes of other nanotechnol - ogy patents are more likely to be seen as a member of an emerging category . At the same time , the effect of an interdisciplinary logic should also be more salient for patents that are highly typical of an emerging category such as nanotechnology because typicality eases the cate - gorical imperative by making it easier to view the blend as an instance of the pattern associated with an emerging category . For nanotechnology patents that cite multiple primary patent classes , we thus expect the usual negative reactions to category blends to be further eased as ( a ) institutional logics for judging research shifted from favor - ing single inventors in clear ﬁelds to favoring the work of interdisciplinary teams , and ( b ) repeated combinations made nanotechnology earn increasing approval as a new category in its own right . This leads to the following three - way interaction hypotheses for both dimensions of patent approval . Hypothesis 7 ( H7 ) . The hypothesized pattern in H3 will be more salient for patents that blend categories that are typical of the emerging nanotechnology . That is , even with the increasing prevalence of an interdisciplinary logic , combining multiple categories is only associated with shorter approval time when it matches the emerging category templates in nanotechnology . Hypothesis 8 ( H8 ) . The hypothesized pattern in H4 will be more salient for patents that blend categories that are typical of the emerging nanotechnology . That is , even with the increasing prevalence of an interdisciplinary logic , combining multiple categories is only associated with higher forward citations when it matches the emerging category templates in nanotechnology . In summary , we expect that the categorical imperative affects patent approval in both senses , albeit with dimin - ishing marginal effects of blending a larger number of categories , and that this effect is moderated by macro - level effects of institutional logics for evaluating quality and micro - level effects of cognitive limits that prompt catego - rization of increasingly prevalent category blends . Data and Methods Nanotechnology as an Emerging Research Field The vision for nanotechnology harkens back to Caltech physicist Richard P . Feynman and his 1959 keynote address to the American Physical Society , “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom . ” 3 At a time when computers occupied entire rooms , Feynman dreamed of “manipulat - ing and controlling things on a small scale . ” Although his predictions ultimately did come to pass , they were so far - fetched in 1959 that the idea languished with neither a name nor further attention until 1974 , when Tokyo University of Science Professor Norio Taniguchi coined the term “nanotechnology” in a conference proceedings paper ( Taniguchi 1974 ) . Realizing Feynman’s vision , however , took more than a catchy name . As engineering advances lowered costs and boosted the potential payoffs of nanoscale research ( Darby and Zucker 2006 ) , a growing cadre of scientists came to see nanotechnology as having real potential , and their efforts began to link far - ﬂung communities in research and government to promote a more realistic nanoscale research program as a national priority . Building on an early program that investigated the synthesis of nano - sized particles , the NSF inaugurated a fully ﬂedged interagency program to formulate and fund a national strategy for nanotechnology ( McCray 2005 ) that featured a think tank consisting of academics , industrialists , and scientists from various U . S . laboratories . By the early 2000s , these efforts had clearly borne fruit . In 1997 , U . S . President Bill Clinton personally announced the National Nanotechnology Initiative , a policy aimed at encouraging science and technology focused on manipulating matter at nanoscale—100 nm or less . As Figure 1 shows , U . S . government investment in nanotechnology accelerated . As further indication of nanotechnology’s arrival as an important new category of R & D , the USPTO announced a new classiﬁcation for nanotechnology patents in 2005—patent class 977 . Whereas class 977 now helps examiners and inventors perform prior art searches , examiners previously relied on class combinations and keyword searches for this job . Figure 2 shows the longer history of growth in nano - related patents .

Lo and Kennedy : Micro and Macro Factors That Affect Reactions to Category Blending Organization Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 21 , ©2014 INFORMS 7 nanotechnology - related patents issued by the USPTO between 1976 and 2005 . The Nanobank staff selected patents either for having patent class 977 , the class for nanotechnology , or based on matching relevant keywords in the patent text . As is the case with all patents , nanotech patents are required to cite the primary classes when they extend or build on prior art , so patents associated with multiple classes extend or draw on all the cited classes . Examiners weigh each claim carefully , checking it not only against prior art in the cited classes but also against prior art they deem relevant . When the USPTO issues a patent , therefore , the number of patent classes it lists reﬂects the linkages drawn by both inventors and examiners . Thus , we used the number of primary patent classes listed on nanotechnology patents as a measure of the extent to which a patent ﬁts into a single dis - tinctly categorized area of prior art versus building on and extending multiple areas of prior art . Since information on denied patent applications is generally unavailable from the USPTO and therefore also from Nanobank , our data do not include observations on denied patent applications . Variables Dependent Variables . Our hypotheses call for two dependent variables : time to approval and forward cita - tions . In this study , we consider both meanings of approval—that is , approval as appraisal and approval as acknowledgment of signiﬁcance . Although both of our dependent variables capture both types of approval to some degree , they also differ in important ways . Time to approval measures how long it takes examiners to process ﬁled applications , a process that is primarily about appraising and evaluating the claimed applications and novelty of the focal application . Since forward citations have been conventionally used in the innovation literature as an indicator of a patent’s value or importance ( Hall et al . 2005 ) , they are conceptually closer to approval as an acknowledgment of a patent’s signiﬁcance .

The numbers shown here are based on patents granted by the USPTO and are drawn from Nanobank , a database that includes information on granted patents , but not applications . Time to approval : The time it takes to review a patent provides a measure of how recognizable a patent applica - tion is to USPTO examiners . We deﬁne this variable as the natural log of the number of months elapsed between the ﬁling date of a patent and the date it gets approved . Forward citations : The cumulative number of citations a patent receives in its ﬁrst three years after approval provides a measure of the recognition of a patent’s signiﬁcance . To ensure three full years are included in this measure , we excluded patents that were granted after 2002 from the citations analysis because the USPTO did not publish information on pending patents until November 2000 . Patents ﬁled before that date ( most of our observations ) were not accessible to be cited by later patents until approved . Independent Variables and Moderators . Number of classes : We measure the number of categories an inven - tion builds on by noting the number ( count ) of primary patent classes that it lists . Although patents list both primary and secondary classes from the United States Patent Classiﬁcation ( USPC ) , we only count the primary classes since those are the most salient categories to both examiners and inventors . We also tried measures based on alternative classiﬁcation systems , including the International Patent Classes ( IPC ) and the corresponding technology ﬁelds ( instead of patent classes ) deﬁned by the World Intellectual Property Organization ( WIPO ) . Given the skewness of this measure , we also ran the models with both the natural - log and square root transformations of the count . As detailed in Robustness Checks section below , results were very similar . Interdisciplinary logic : Hypotheses 3 – 6 propose tests of effects of the rise of a logic that favors interdisciplinary research ( IDR logic ) . To measure the institutionalization of the IDR logic , we interviewed 12 experts involved with NSF or NIH efforts to measure or promote IDR growth . From these interviews , it became clear that the NSF and NIH had struggled to deﬁne a clear standard for research that should be counted as interdisciplinary . Nonetheless , we also found consensus around a simple and widely accepted litmus test for the interdisciplinarity of grants : whether grants have only a single principal investigator ( PI ) or multiple investigators . In practice , multi - PI proposals typically come from researchers with different disciplinary backgrounds . Hence , we measure the growth of the IDR logic by year by computing the number of NSF grants awarded to proposals with multiple principal investigators ( % multi - PI awards ) . This measure is supported by the NSF’s internal documentation and a National Academy of Sciences publication titled Facilitating Interdisciplinary Research ( National Academy of Sciences 2004 ) . The NSF itself uses annual statistics on single - versus multi - PI grants to demonstrate the trend of increasing NSF support for IDR in a number of reports , including the " Impact of D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 240 . 225 . 44 ] on 21 D ece m b e r 2014 , a t 23 : 57 .

In approval time analyses , we use this measure for the year in which a patent application is ﬁled ( application year ) . In forward citation analysis , we use the percentage of multi - PI awards in the year a patent application is approved ( grant year ) . Figure 3 shows the general pattern of multi - PI versus single - PI proposals funded by NSF over years . The overall trend shows steady growth in the % multi - PI variable throughout our study period . Typicality : For Hypotheses 5 – 8 , we constructed a variable that measures how similar a patent’s primary classes are to those in other nanotechnology patents . This is done in two steps . First , we compute a proximity index for each pair of classes in the data set based on the number of times classes i and j that appear together in the same patent . The proximity index P ij for two classes i and j is the average of two proportions , and it is calculated by dividing the number of times the classes are comentioned by the total number of times the ﬁrst and second are mentioned , respectively . It can be written as follows : P ij = 1 2 (cid:18) C ij C i + C ij C j (cid:19) (cid:49) ( 1 ) where C ij is the number of times classes i and j appear together in a patent ( except for the focal patent ) over the ﬁve years prior to the focal patent year , and C i and C j are the total number of times that classes i and j appear in that time window , respectively . Second , to measure how typical a patent is with respect to others in the Nanobank data , we average the proximity indices for every unordered pair of patent classes it lists . Larger scores mean that a patent’s listed classes occur together more frequently , whereas smaller scores mean a patent’s listed classes represent a more unusual or atypical blend of prior art areas . We calculate typicality as follows : T = (cid:80) P ij (cid:54)L(cid:52)L − 1 (cid:53)(cid:55) / 2 (cid:49) ( 2 ) Figure 3 Percentage of Multi - PI Proposals Funded by NSF Among All NSF Awards , 1982 – 2006 (cid:16) (cid:17)(cid:16) (cid:18)(cid:16) (cid:19)(cid:16) (cid:20)(cid:16) (cid:5) (cid:21)(cid:16) (cid:22)(cid:16) (cid:23)(cid:16) (cid:17)(cid:25)(cid:24) (cid:18) (cid:17)(cid:25)(cid:24) (cid:20) (cid:17)(cid:25)(cid:24) (cid:22) (cid:17)(cid:25)(cid:24) (cid:24) (cid:17)(cid:25)(cid:25) (cid:16) (cid:17)(cid:25)(cid:25) (cid:18) (cid:17)(cid:25)(cid:25) (cid:20) (cid:17)(cid:25)(cid:25) (cid:22) (cid:17)(cid:25)(cid:25) (cid:24) (cid:18)(cid:16)(cid:16) (cid:16) (cid:18)(cid:16)(cid:16) (cid:18) (cid:18)(cid:16)(cid:16) (cid:20) (cid:18)(cid:16)(cid:16) (cid:22) (cid:5)(cid:0)(cid:79)(cid:70)(cid:0)(cid:46)(cid:51)(cid:38)(cid:0)(cid:35)(cid:79)(cid:13)(cid:48)(cid:41)(cid:0)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:65)(cid:78)(cid:84)(cid:83)(cid:0)(cid:73)(cid:78)(cid:0)(cid:68)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:76)(cid:65)(cid:82)(cid:0)(cid:86)(cid:65)(cid:76)(cid:85)(cid:69) (cid:5)(cid:0)(cid:79)(cid:70)(cid:0)(cid:46)(cid:51)(cid:38)(cid:0)(cid:35)(cid:79)(cid:13)(cid:48)(cid:41)(cid:0)(cid:71)(cid:82)(cid:65)(cid:78)(cid:84)(cid:83)(cid:0)(cid:73)(cid:78)(cid:0)(cid:78)(cid:85)(cid:77)(cid:66)(cid:69)(cid:82) where T is patent typicality , P ij are measures of proximity for each unordered pair of classes listed by the patent , and L is the length of the patent’s primary class list . For patents that have only one class , the typicality score is 1 , since a “combination” of a single class is by deﬁnition fully typical of all possible permutations . As a robustness check , we also create a weighted version of the typicality score by following the same strategy but weighting T by what is effectively the market share of each patent class ; results are very similar for both approaches . Control Variables . Our patent - level control variables include the number of inventors , number of assignees , the patenting experience of the patent’s primary assignee as measured by the average number of patents previously granted to that person ( assignee experience ) , the primary assignee’s institutional afﬁliation ( university , ﬁrm , or research institution ) , and the number of claims a patent makes . We also control for several organizational factors at USPTO that could affect evaluation time . Speciﬁcally , we control for average time to approval for all ( approved ) patents and USPTO workload , a measure that reﬂects pressures examiners might have been under because of stafﬁng shortages . Examiner workload is computed as total pending patents divided by total stafﬁng , i . e . , the average number of patents that an examiner is currently processing . Moreover , to control for the effect of personal computers and text - based search techniques on examiner routines and the search activity of later inventors , we also include two era dummies : the PC era ( 1987 – 1999 ) and Internet era ( 2000 onward ) . If our independent variables are signiﬁcant when controlling for these new tools , that would suggest ( a ) the class list length pushes examiners toward chunking over and above pressures related to workload and that this holds ( b ) even as technology enables them to handle larger loads . For other year - level controls , we include the number of NSF - funded proposals ( total NSF awards ) as well as the year in which a patent application is ﬁled ( application year ) or the year in which the patent is granted ( grant year ) . Models and Estimation Since the dependent variable for our approval time analy - ses is the number of months before a patent is approved , we use survival analyses to assess the effects of covariates on the hazard rate of patent approval ; a higher hazard rate means a patent is approved more quickly . We chose to ﬁt our data with Cox proportional models . As an alternative estimation , we also run ordinary least squares ( OLS ) regressions with robust standard errors for the pending time analysis , and the results are consistent . For the forward citation analyses , the dependent variable is a count with overdispersion , so we use negative bino - mial regression with robust standard errors ( Cameron and Trivedi 1986 ) ; results of Poisson regressions with D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 240 . 225 . 44 ] on 21 D ece m b e r 2014 , a t 23 : 57 .

To ensure our results are robust to reasonable options for model speciﬁcation and choices of measures , we performed a series of alternative estimations and robustness checks , discussed in greater detail below . Results Table 1 shows the correlations among variables used in our analyses . That the percentage of multi - PI awards was highly correlated with year variables is consistent with the qualitative evidence suggesting that the emergence of an interdisciplinary institutional logic precedes and aids the institutionalization of nanotechnology as a single new class of R & D . To reduce the high correlations between our variable for the IDR logic and some of the year - level controls , we logged year , total NSF awards granted in a year , and average time to approval and workload at USPTO . Analyses of Time to Approval Table 2 shows results for analyses of evaluation time and tests of Hypotheses 1 , 3 , 5 , and 7 ; coefﬁcients are unstandardized . After summarizing statistical results , we interpret the substantive effects by reviewing interpretation charts for each result . The coefﬁcients reported are regres - sion coefﬁcients rather than exponentiated coefﬁcients or hazard ratios . Recall that we use survival analysis to estimate the hazard rate of patent approval ; therefore , a positive coefﬁcient indicates a shorter time to approval . Model 1 has controls only . In terms of patent - level control variables , the negative signs of number of inventors and assignees suggest that patents with more inventors and assignees take longer to approve , and approval time is longer for university patents than for ﬁrm patents . The positive sign of assignee patenting experience suggests that it accelerates the approval processes , hence reducing time to approval . The number of claims reduces the hazard rate , implying that complexity and scope of patents tend to prolong the evaluation time . Models 2 and 3 show results for H1 , which states that approval time increases with the number of primary classes listed , albeit at a decreasing rate . Model 2 adds only the linear form of the number of primary patent classes that each patent lists , or blends ; consistent with prior research , results in Model 2 show that category blending has a negative effect on approval rate ( p < 0 (cid:48) 001 ) —that is , it increases approval time . Model 3 adds the quadratic term for the number of primary patent classes in a patent . Likelihood - ratio tests showed that the model improved signiﬁcantly when the quadratic term of the independent variable was added ( p < 0 (cid:48) 001 ) . The coefﬁcients of the linear and quadratic terms for primary classes are signiﬁcant ( p < 0 (cid:48) 001 ) and negative and positive , respectively . This indicates the predicted diminishing effect of blending on approval rate and pending time , thereby providing support for H1 .

Model 4 shows results for H3 , our prediction that emer - gence and increasing prevalence of an interdisciplinary logic of evaluation should ease the negative effects of blending multiple categories of knowledge . Using the percentage of NSF grants awarded to multi - PI proposals as a proxy for emergence of an interdisciplinary logic , results show a signiﬁcant ( p < 0 (cid:48) 001 ) interaction with category blending . Model 5 tests the typicality - blending interaction of H5 , as shown in the coefﬁcients of the two variables that multiply typicality scores by the linear and squared terms for the number of classes cited . Although these coefﬁcients are signiﬁcant ( p < 0 (cid:48) 001 ) , the negative and positive signs suggest a more complex relationship than what we had hypothesized . When blending a smallish number of classes , typicality is associated with slower rates of approval and longer approval time , but this effect D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 240 . 225 . 44 ] on 21 D ece m b e r 2014 , a t 23 : 57 .

Lo and Kennedy : Micro and Macro Factors That Affect Reactions to Category Blending Organization Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 21 , ©2014 INFORMS 11 reverses when blending a larger number of classes . This suggests that in a context that values novelty , being typ - ical or familiar is not entirely beneﬁcial ; rather , there appears to be a penalty of typicality for category blends . 4 However , the beneﬁt of blending classes in familiar ways outweighs the potential drawbacks of familiarity when the number of classes blended is large enough . This could be because when two patents build on a similar set of classes , building on a larger set of classes affords greater opportunity for the two patents to be different . Models 6 and 7 test H7 , the three - way interaction hypothesis that predicts that the moderating effect of the IDR logic will be more salient among typical patents . Although adding a simple three - way interaction is signiﬁ - cant ( p < 0 (cid:48) 001 ) , the results we report here are obtained by splitting the study sample into high and low typicality subgroups , using one standard deviation below and above the mean as the cutoff point , and running the same regres - sion in Model 5 . As shown , neither the coefﬁcients for the class list length nor the interaction between class and IDR logic is signiﬁcant for the low - typicality group , but for the high - typicality group , the signs of the ﬁrst - order class list length and its interaction with IDR logic are signiﬁcantly negative and positive , respectively . This suggests the moderating effect of the interaction between blending and having a blend - friendly logic is driven by blends that are typical of other nanotechnology patents . Figures 4 ( a ) and 4 ( b ) show graphical interpretations of the ﬁndings just described , produced by OLS regressions using the same variables contained in Table 2 . In each graph , the x axis is the number of primary classes listed in each patent , and the y axis is predicted time to approval , in months . Each graph shows three separate lines for low , medium , and high levels of interdisciplinary support . Although we see patents that build on as many as 16 primary classes , we limit the x axis to 7 to avoid graphing projections based on only a small number of extreme observations . This ensures each patent class level illus - trated in our predictions is represented by at least several hundred observations ; as one would expect , the more extreme observations give more pronounced versions of the patterns as graphed . To further clarify how changes in predicted approval time relate to the distribution of how many categories nanotech patents blend , we add vertical lines for means and standard deviations of the number of categories blended . Figure 4 ( a ) interprets the results for H1 and H3 by showing three overlaid versions of the classes—approval time relationship , one each for multi - PI grant levels at the mean ( medium ) and one standard deviation below ( low ) and above ( high ) . The line for low level of the interdisciplinary logic is consistent with H1 , our prediction that pending time should increase with the number of classes a patent blends , but at a decreasing rate . Also , the lines for medium - and high - IDR logics show clear Figure 4 ( a ) ( Color online ) Average Time to Approval for Nanotech Patents 15 20 25 30 35 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Number of patent classes M on t h s t o app r o v a l Mean + 1 S .

Low IDR Med IDR High IDR support for H3 , our prediction that shifting to a blend - friendly evaluation logic should moderate blending’s usually adverse effect on reactions to category blends . As seen in the low - IDR line , approval time increases with almost no decline as more classes are listed , but the high - IDR line shows a positive relationship between blending and approval time that declines and even reverses for blends of more than about ﬁve primary classes . This pattern of results is consistent with our argument that evaluators cope with the burden of evaluating inventions that build on multiple classes by recognizing recurring blends as patterns that facilitate the review process by making it easier to relate patents to relevant prior art . Note that this reversal pattern only happens at the high end of the distribution . Recall that the mean and standard deviation of classes blended are 1 . 92 and 1 . 07 , respectively . About 8 % of the patents in our sample blend four or more classes , and 4 % blend ﬁve or more primary classes . Figure 4 ( b ) sheds light on the three - way interaction between the extent of category blending , institutionaliza - tion of the IDR logic , and typicality with blend patterns of nanotechnology patents . The ﬁgure shows graphical predictions of approval time for patents of low ( left panel ) and high levels of typicality ( right panel ) , using the mean value as cutoff points . By looking at the low - IDR lines in each graph , we see that blending more classes increases approval time in this condition , regardless of patent typicality . Looking at the high - IDR lines across the two graphs , however , we see that the shift to a more blend - friendly evaluation logic changes the effects of category blending markedly , but only for patents that blend classes highly typical of nanotechnology . As shown in Figure 4 ( b ) , when the interdisciplinary logic is more prevalent , time to approval increases relatively sharply with category blending , but this pattern clearly reverses for blends of ﬁve or more categories . This is not true , however , for low - typicality patents , as shown in Fig - ure 4 ( b ) . This result clearly supports the argument that institutional logics can moderate the generally negative D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 240 . 225 . 44 ] on 21 D ece m b e r 2014 , a t 23 : 57 .

Low IDR Med IDR High IDR effect of category blending , especially for patents that resemble an emerging pattern in nanotechnology . Again , this moderating effect happens at the high end of our distribution , suggesting that the categorical imperative thesis applies to the majority of category blends , but things change when patents blend a sufﬁciently large number of classes in ways that resemble blends common to nanotech patents , especially as the interdisciplinary logic attenuates the negative effects of category blending . Analyses of Forward Citations Table 3 shows the results of our analyses of forward citations and tests of Hypotheses 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 . As with approval time , we ﬁrst summarize our statistical results and then interpret the substantive effects by reviewing interpretation charts for each result . Recall that we mea - sure forward citations as the number of citations a patent receives in its ﬁrst three years after approval . Model 1 includes only control variables , which show generally expected effects : the number of inventors , assignee’s patenting experience , and number of claims listed in a patent all contribute to forward citations . Patents with university and ﬁrm ownership tend to be cited more than patents assigned to other types of institutions . Model 2 adds the number of classes listed in a patent , but only in its linear form . Interestingly , the measure of category blending has a positive effect on forward citations ( p < 0 (cid:48) 001 ) . This result represents a further boundary condition to the categorical imperative thesis : the usually negative reactions to category blends depend on context - speciﬁc logics of evaluation and on the type of approval in question . For approval as acknowledgment , building on multiple categories leads to greater approval , not to being ignored or discounted . Model 3 shows results for H2 , which states that forward citations increase with the number of classes a patent builds on , although at a diminishing rate . We test this prediction by including both the linear and quadratic forms of the number of classes blended by patents . The coefﬁcients of the linear and quadratic terms of class list length are both signiﬁcant ( p < 0 (cid:48) 001 ) , with negative and positive signs , respectively . For blending only a few classes , therefore , citations decrease with the number of categories blended , but this effect diminishes ( or even reverses ) for patents that blend a larger number of classes . Model 4 shows the results of H4 , our hypothesis that emergence of a blend - friendly evaluation logic ( as mea - sured by the percentage of multi - PI awards ) should ease the negative effects of blending and contribute to greater forward citation counts . When the interdisciplinary logic interaction is added , results show not only signiﬁcant coefﬁcients ( p < 0 (cid:48) 001 ) for the number of classes listed and its square but also a reversal of signs compared with Model 3 . This reversal of coefﬁcients provides support for H4 : emergence of an interdisciplinary logic for evaluating R & D moderates the negative reactions to category - defying innovations , especially for patents blending a large number of classes . Model 5 tests H6 , our prediction that citation counts will be higher for patents that blend a set of multiple categories that is typical of nanotech patents . As in our approval time analyses , results show that typicality does moderate the effect of category blending , though in a more complicated way than we have hypothesized . Although the interaction with the squared term of number of classes listed is positive , the interaction with the ﬁrst - order term of class list length is negative . This again suggests that being typical is not purely beneﬁcial in the patenting context , which makes sense given the requirement for novelty . Furthermore , it suggests that the positive effect of resembling the emerging prototype of nanotechnology only happens to patents that blend a very large number of classes ; again , this makes sense because , as noted above , the larger the collection of classes being blended , the more room there is to do something different . Models 6 and 7 test H8 , which predicts that the mod - erating effect of an interdisciplinary logic will be more salient for category blends that match the emerging cate - gory templates in nanotechnology .

As shown , the moderating effects of the interdisci - plinary logic are indeed more pronounced among the high typicality group , judging from both the magnitude and signiﬁcance of the coefﬁcients of the interaction terms between class list length and IDR logic . We have also put a simple interaction term for number of classes , multi - PI grants ( IDR logic ) , and typicality , and the results are consistent with the patterns reported here . Figures 5 ( a ) and 5 ( b ) show graphical interpretations of the ﬁndings just described . In each graph , the x axis is the number of primary classes listed in each patent , and the y axis is the predicted number of forward citations received by a patent . Each graph shows three lines : one for low , medium , and high levels of interdisciplinary support . Again , we limit the x axis to 7 to avoid graphing predictions based on only a small number of extreme obser - vations . This ensures each patent class level illustrated in our predictions is represented by at least several hundred observations ; as one would expect , including the more extreme observations gives similar but more pronounced shapes . As in Figures 4 ( a ) and 4 ( b ) , we add vertical lines to show how blending values are related to the mean and standard deviation .

Recall that H2 predicts a positive but diminishing main effect of blending on forward citations and that H4 predicts that shifting to a more blend - friendly evaluation logic will moderate this relationship . Comparing the low - and high - IDR lines of Figure 5 ( a ) , the classes - to - citations relationship ﬂips from concave in the low - IDR line to convex in the high - IDR line ; this is consistent with our prediction that the emergence of a blend - friendly logic will moderate blending’s effect on citations . In the low - IDR line , forward citations rise with the number of classes that patents build on , and this effect diminishes at the upper limit of number of classes , as we hypothesized in H2 . In the high - IDR line , however , citations ﬁrst fall with initial increases in the number of classes , but this effect reverses beginning at four classes so that citations are higher for patents that blend four or more classes . This shows that blending’s beneﬁcial effects on citations are initially decreased but eventually ampliﬁed by the rise of the IDR evaluation logic ; in other words , patents that blend a large number of classes clearly beneﬁt from the Figure 5 ( b ) ( Color online ) Number of Citations to Nanotech Patents of Low ( Left ) and High ( Right ) Typicality 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Low IDR Med IDR High IDR Patents with low typicality Patents with high typicality F o r w a r d c i t a t i on s Mean + 1 S .

D . shift in logic , although this is not the case for patents blending only a few categories . Figure 5 ( b ) interprets results for tests of H8 , that citations should be affected by a three - way interaction between the extent of blending , the shift to a blend - friendly evaluation logic , and typicality . As in Figure 5 ( a ) , these ﬁgures show that low levels of IDR logic are associated with a concave relationship between blending and citations for both low and high typicality groups ; as the IDR logic becomes more established , the shape of curve remains largely unchanged for the low - typicality group but ﬂips for the high - typicality group . In other words , the hypothesized moderating effect of IDR logic is only seen in patents that blend classes in ways typical of nanotechnology . Moreover , note that the beneﬁcial effect of blending multiple classes in the high - IDR era is only seen among typical patents that blend more than three categories . This suggests a nuanced pattern that we did not hypothesize : even when the logic legitimates interdisciplinary research , blending multiple categories in a typical way helps a patent earn greater approval - as - acknowledgment from subsequent inventors only when patents blend a larger number of categories . Our speculation for this pattern is that blending loses its perceived novelty because it is seen in a growing number of inventions , but blending a larger number of categories leaves more room for novel variation . Again , these results strongly support our overall theoretical argument that contextual factors facilitate the recognition of category - blending inventions and new categories that emerge around them . To summarize our results for both sets of analyses , we ﬁnd that blending multiple patent classes has ( 1 ) a negative , albeit diminishing , effect on approval rate ( hence increasing the pending time at a decreasing rate ) and ( 2 ) a positive , albeit diminishing , effect on forward citations . Furthermore , we ﬁnd that these main effects of category blending are moderated by ( 3 ) the institutionalization of an interdisciplinary logic for evaluating research ; ( 4 ) blending categories in a pattern that is typical of the emerging D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 240 . 225 . 44 ] on 21 D ece m b e r 2014 , a t 23 : 57 .

Robustness Checks We performed a series of robustness checks to assess how our ﬁndings hold up under alternative measures and model speciﬁcations . As shown in Table 1 , the number of primary patent classes is left skewed ; that is , the mean , standard deviation , and maximum are roughly 2 , 1 , and 14 , respectively . Therefore , we tried two alternative speciﬁcations of the independent variables . Speciﬁcally , we took the natural log and square root of the number of primary patent classes and reran the models with these transformations ; the patterns were very similar in both cases . To eliminate the possibility that our ﬁndings might be artifacts of the USPC system , we also ran our analyses using measures based on both the IPC and WIPO proposed lists of “technology ﬁelds” corresponding to the IPC system . Using information on how WIPO technology ﬁelds map into IPC codes , we constructed measures for each of the two alternative systems and reran our analyses with them . To account for potential heterogeneity among different technology ﬁelds , we also used WIPO categories as dummy variables and included those as additional controls , which is equivalent to running ﬁxed ﬁeld effects models . In each case , results were consistent with the results reported in Tables 2 and 3 , lending further support to our ﬁndings . We also explored whether our ﬁndings are robust to different observation windows for forward citations . In addition to a three - year window , we tried windows of two , four , and ﬁve years . We also conducted time - series analyses to account for potential time effects . Based on these results , it appears our ﬁndings are not sensitive to changes in the forward citation window . To assess whether results depend on patents with highly unusual characteristics , we reran the analyses after excluding outliers such as cases with a 10 - year pending time or an extremely high number of citations . Results were unchanged . Thus , the results in Tables 2 and 3 include the entire Nanobank collection of nanotechnology patents . To assess robustness with respect to estimation tech - niques , we tried several alternative model speciﬁcations . For the pending time analyses , we conducted Cox pro - portional hazards , log - normal , and OLS regressions with a logged dependent variable . The patterns were consis - tent across models . To rule out effects of unobserved time - speciﬁc factors such as shortages or surpluses in examiner time , we included year dummies in the models ; results were essentially the same with or without them . Since many patents receive no citations , we also tried zero - inﬂated Poisson and zero - inﬂated negative binomial regressions , but results were essentially unchanged . Finally , we also conducted additional analyses to test the validity of our argument about typicality and cognitive load . Using the number of claims a patent makes as a proxy for complexity , the number of claims should prolong approval time . As indicated in the controls section of Table 2 , the number of claims does have a signiﬁcant negative effect on approval rates ( i . e . , increase time to approval ) . If our argument that typicality reduces the cognitive demands of evaluation were valid , there ought to be a signiﬁcant interaction between typicality and the number of claims . As inventions that build on similar combinations of categories of prior art are recognized as a new category of R & D , such recognition should support a positive interaction between typicality and the number of claims . In unreported supplementary analysis , the typicality – claims interaction has a signiﬁcant and positive effect on approval rates in later periods but not in earlier years . Discussion Our study of approval in nanotechnology patterns addresses a theoretical puzzle raised by apparently con - tradictory ﬁndings in organization studies . On the one hand , there is a literature that observes generally negative reactions to unfamiliar mixes of distinct categories ( Hsu 2006b ; Zuckerman 1999 , 2005 ) ; on the other hand , stud - ies of innovation show new categories sometimes arise from novel recombinations of things not previously seen together ( Clemens 1993 , Dollinger 1984 , Schumpeter 1934 , Sismondo 2009 ) . These contradictory ﬁndings raise some fundamental questions : How do category - blending inventions overcome the categorical imperative and earn individual approval from both important critics ( such as patent examiners ) and audiences more broadly ? How do blend - based inventions earn the approval that comes from being acknowledged as potentially useful and built on by later inventors ? How and when do repeated blends with a family resemblance earn the approval of getting recognized as a new category unto themselves ? When it comes to the value of sticking to known categories versus coloring outside the lines , so to speak , the case of nanotechnology suggests approval routines like the ones used by the USPTO offer a mechanism for transforming the usual negative reactions to category blends . Although categories can be quite durable ( Tilly 1999 ) , category systems and individual category meanings do evolve and change . Taking the view that the meaning of any category is always at some risk of change ( Kennedy et al . 2010 ) , we conceptualize a category blend as , in effect , a mash - up with the potential to earn approval that , if widely acknowledged , leads to recognition of a new category around it . Although the concept of nanotechnol - ogy was once viewed as a science ﬁction fantasy , the approval of inventions that blended ideas from multiple ﬁelds transformed what was merely a hopeful category claim—and a suspect one at best—into what is now a widely recognized category of research and development .

Lo and Kennedy : Micro and Macro Factors That Affect Reactions to Category Blending 16 Organization Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 21 , ©2014 INFORMS Inspired by cases such as nanotechnology , this paper develops a new theory of reactions to category blending that features both micro and macro features of cognition . Speciﬁcally , we argue that reactions to category blends are shaped not only by cognitive limits but also by context - speciﬁc logics of evaluation—that is , institutionalized views of how to think about what counts as valuable . In the context of patent ofﬁce review of nanotechnol - ogy inventions , the logic of patent review is inherently blend - friendly , and this blend - friendliness was strength - ened as research tastes and priorities shifted to promote interdisciplinary research . At the micro level , reactions to category blends are affected by the very cognitive limits that work against recognition of category - defying patents . We see this in the approvals of recurring blends that were gradually recognized not only as nanotechnology but also as subcategories such as nano - bio , nano - materials , and nano - manipulation , to name just a few . Contributions and Implications The main contribution of this research is to develop a theory of approval of category - blending innovations that relates reactions to category blends to both micro - and macro - level features of cognition . Speciﬁcally , we argue that approval of category - blending inventions is subject to macro - or institutional - level routines and norms that determine whether the prevailing logic for evaluating quality is friendly to blends , and we further argue that blend approval is equally subject to the micro - level factor of cognitive limits that create a different sort of categorical imperative—the imperative to categorize blends that recur increasingly often in order to economize the cognitive workload of evaluating them . Distinguishing between approval as appraisal and approval as acknowledgment , we argue that the illegitimacy discount is altered by context - speciﬁc evaluation logics that are more or less friendly to blends ; repetition of speciﬁc blend patterns ; and whether a blend matches , or is typical of , a particular blend pattern that is growing in frequency . When logic , repetition , and typicality combine in favor of blends , blends earn quicker initial approval and wider subsequent approval . Also , by distinguishing between approvals as appraisal versus acknowledgment , we further explain how logics , repetition , and typicality have different effects on initial approval versus subsequent approval . Overall , we argue that blend - friendly logics , blend repetition , and blend typicality together support faster initial approval and wider subsequent approval of category - blending inventions . Our differential ﬁndings about approval as appraisal versus acknowledgment suggest a nuanced relationship between micro - and macro - level features of cognition that affect reactions to category blends . In the patent context , the job of managing the review process introduces a tension between the demand for novelty and the need to make sense of new kinds of inventions . In other words , the logic of patent reviews favors novelty and therefore moderates the usually negative reactions to category blends , which creates incentives to depart from the familiar as well as the need to categorize the unfamiliar . As noted above , this is why we say that categorization is both a reﬂection of and a response to cognitive limits . Furthermore , it explains why blending’s negative effect on approval rates tails off and even reverses at high levels of blending and why the highest citations happen at the right tail of the distribution of the extent of blending . When blends receive very positive reactions , it is not only because of the increasing prevalence of a logic favoring interdisciplinary research but also because the prevalence of similar blends enables recognition of a new category broad enough to permit novel variation within it as required for patent approval . Although this tension is particularly salient in the patenting context , novelty is valued in many other contexts as well , and the emergence and recognition of new categories are eventually a result of these two seemingly contradictory and yet often intertwined forces . To be clear , our theory and analyses afﬁrm prior theory by showing that category blending negatively affects the evaluation or appraisal process by adding to approval time , but we also extend these ﬁndings by showing that this effect is not linear—the negative effects of blending diminish with the number of categories blended . When it comes to approval as acknowledgment , however , we ﬁnd that blending has a positive effect on forward citations , a measure of getting approval from subsequent inventors , and this effect also diminishes with the extent of category blending . All else equal , blending lengthens the time it takes to approve an invention , but blending also helps inventions gain wider approval as novel and valuable . Thus , blending entails risks of inattention and disapproval as a misﬁt , but some blends—such as the ones that constitute nanotechnology—eventually do get recognized as innovation . Our argument that reactions to blends reﬂect context - speciﬁc macro - level inﬂuences on cognition echoes and extends results from studies of other contexts . Armstrong ( 2002 ) , for example , uses social movements to argue that communities vary in the degree to which they are contexts for collective creativity , and Pontikes ( 2012 ) uses the software industry to observe that reactions to hard - to - categorize organizations depend on preferences of the audience and the structure of categories . Whereas the micro level of our theory links blend recognition to typicality with recurring blends , Wry and Lounsbury ( 2013 ) ﬁnd that start - up ﬁrms are less likely to suffer the negative effects of blending or “bridging” multiple categories when the categories being blended are perceived as similar . From a broader perspective on categories , our research heeds recent calls to look beyond the conformity pressures exerted by categories to explore not only how the effects of categories relate to why and when they are invoked ( Durand and Paolella 2013 ) but also the role D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 240 . 225 . 44 ] on 21 D ece m b e r 2014 , a t 23 : 57 .

At the micro level of analysis , our argument also extends theorizing about categories and cognition by showing that repeated blends create pressures for recognition of new categories . Empirically , we support this argument by showing that repeated blends can become templates for new categories so that yesterday’s category - blending misﬁt is sometimes tomorrow’s category - deﬁning prototype . When category blends match the formula for recurring blends , typicality with the emerging prototype moderates the usual negative reactions to category blending . That said , our analyses reveal a more complicated moderating effect than what we have hypothesized : being typical of a repeated blend is not necessarily a blessing in the patenting context . Furthermore , the beneﬁcial effect of typicality is only seen at very high level of blending ; this suggests that context is a powerful moderator of the categorical imperative thesis . As noted above , our argument injects an element of dynamism to a core thesis of ecological theory by explaining how and why new ecologies emerge even in the face of ecological pressures that seem stacked against category - blending innovation . In essence , we show what amounts to a density dependence for category blending in which the prevalence of repeated blends becomes a factor that eventually counteracts the initially negative reactions usually associated with unfamiliar new blends . Overall , this research contributes most directly to the organizational literature on categories and cognition . Putting our ﬁndings in terms of that literature , we show that conformity pressures exerted by institutionalized categories against category - blending inventions are eased by institutional logics that approve novelty and reject conformity , and we further show that recurring blends and typicality with them moderate the usually negative effects of category blending , especially for inventions that blend many ( as opposed to just a few ) categories . Hence , the same cognitive limitations that sanction category misﬁts also create pressures to recognize them . Thus , we offer a theoretical argument that highlights moderators of the categorical imperative while also linking category blending to the emergence of new categories by examining two complementary dimensions of approval—time to approval and approval as acknowledgment indicated by citations . One could argue that beneﬁcial effects of blending exist in nanotechnology patents because the patenting context is itself a moderator of the categorical imperative . That may well be , but it could also be that the acknowledgment aspect of approval tends to exhibit a more positive relationship to blending across many contexts . This is a question for future research . More speciﬁcally , this research contributes to the litera - ture on institutional logics . Whereas early institutional theory focused on the idea that conformity brings legiti - macy ( DiMaggio and Powell 1983 , Meyer and Rowan 1977 ) , the logics literature views institutional environments not as homogeneous and static but instead as more plural - istic and dynamic ( Thornton and Ocasio 1999 , Thornton et al . 2012 ) . Taking this view , the logics literature offers signiﬁcant contributions to institutional analysis more generally , especially when it comes to how actors can recombine elements from different social spheres to create new templates for organizing in the broadest sense of the word ( Battilana and Dorado 2010 , Greenwood and Suddaby 2006 , Tracey et al . 2011 ) . Although there is entrepreneurial agency in this process , we believe it is important to rebalance the conversation by acknowledging the role that institutional contexts play in giving latitude for such agency . In other words , the strategic use of cultural tool kits is certainly important to institutional change , but these tool kits are very much products of cultural and institutional contexts ( Bourdieu 1984 , Swidler 1986 ) . As in work on “cultures of collective creativity , ” we are interested in asking how speciﬁc institutional contexts either promote or inhibit change and creativity ( Armstrong 2002 , King et al . 2011 ) . Whereas creativity is often seen as the product of individuals , our ﬁndings suggest that individual creativity thrives more in some contexts than in others . Our ﬁndings thus elaborate on the link between logics and collective creativity . Limitations and Future Research It is noteworthy to mention that the predicted beneﬁcial effect of category blending in the high - IDR era among typical patents only shows up in cases at the upper end of the distribution . As can been seen in our interpretation charts ( Figures 4 and 5 ) , the reversal of the baseline hypotheses only happens when the number of classes go beyond about two standard deviations , suggesting that patents blending signiﬁcantly larger number of classes behave ( and are evaluated ) differently than those that merely blend a few categories , a point worth further exploration for future research . Our analyses of innovation recognition are subject to two important data limitations . First , we relied on approved patents because the USPTO did not provide data on rejected applications until the emergence of nanotech - nology was largely complete . By deﬁnition , this limitation is necessary for patent citation analysis , a commonly used research design in studies of the signiﬁcance and value of patents . For our analyses of pending time , however , having data on rejected patents would make for a more complete analysis . Future uses of patent data in analyses of innovation recognition and category system change should look for opportunities to include data on rejected patent applications . Such analyses would be an excellent opportunity for addressing questions about the dynamics of innovation recognition .

Lo and Kennedy : Micro and Macro Factors That Affect Reactions to Category Blending 18 Organization Science , Articles in Advance , pp . 1 – 21 , ©2014 INFORMS as patterns ? That is , how long does it take for new blends to go from being overlooked as misﬁts to being seen as good ﬁts in widely recognized new categories ? Second , using data on patents numbering in the hun - dreds of thousands spanning several decades made it impractical to track down and control for the disciplinary backgrounds of individual scientists , inventors , and exam - iners , so we did not control for these factors in our analyses . Because we did not control patent examiner backgrounds , we also did not consider the possibility that some patent classes might have been populated by a more homogeneous set of reviewers than others . To account for potential heterogeneity among classes , we controlled the primary “technology ﬁeld” associated with each patent , as described in the results section above . We began the paper by observing that some institutional environments are much more creative than others , but we limited our analysis to a single context , the USPTO patent review process , and the effects of a logic shift within that context . Although using a within - context logic shift is reasonable for our purposes of testing the idea that logics moderate the rate at which category - defying innovations are recognized , future research should test the idea that logic differences explain differences in the rate at which category - defying innovations are recognized . For example , we suspect the interdisciplinary logic shift we used in our analyses resonates with researchers in industry and in divisions of universities that are more in tune with industry or the public policy arena—engineering schools , medical schools , business schools , and policy or planning departments , for example—than in natural science departments . Such comparisons could shed light on broader questions about why some communities see category recombinations more as trade - offs between purity and danger ( Douglas 2002 ) than between opportunity and perpetuation of the status quo ( Gamson and Meyer 1996 ) . Although the shift to adopt a more interdisciplinary logic of research offered an empirical strategy for testing the idea that institutional logics moderate reactions to category blends , we focused on indicators of the emer - gence of this logic without addressing the causes of this shift or the course of ongoing conﬂicts about whether it is a good idea and , if so , how to institutionalize it . Theoretically , the interdisciplinary shift could result from the process Giddens ( 1984 ) describes as structuration , in which the resources and rules that deﬁne a culture interact to affect the prevalence of particular practices . From our reading of the history of the interdisciplinary movement , however , the emergence of interdisciplinary practices had more to do with principles articulated in policies that were translated into incentives . That said , it is certainly also plausible that these principles were derived from successes of earlier practice , even if they were not yet prevalent . In future research on whether and how institutional logics encourage creativity and change , it would be valuable to understand why and how certain logics persist versus change and how the change process affects whether they promote or defend against innovation . In particular , such research could elaborate on the interaction between principle and prevalence , a theme suggested by our research but still largely unexplored . Although our study adds to studies that explore nano - technology by offering a framework for explaining how approval of category - blending inventions leads to new categories , it remains for future research to relate this framework to ﬁndings of these prior studies . For example , Wry et al . ( 2010 ) highlight the role of cultural embed - dedness in their study of intellectual property in carbon nanotubes , Granqvist et al . ( 2013 ) ﬁnd that label ambi - guity was important for companies trying to develop commercial applications of nanotechnology , and Kaplan and Vakili ( 2013 ) propose to study the use of language in distinguishing between useful and truly novel nano - technology patents . More generally , there are broader questions of category emergence and the dynamics of category currency , as proposed by Kennedy et al . ( 2010 ) . Combining the logics literature with work in cate - gories and cognition suggests opportunities to again explore connections between institutional theory and pop - ulation ecology . Notwithstanding common antecedents ( e . g . , Stinchcombe 1965 ) and occasional calls for integra - tion ( Baum and Oliver 1996 ) , these two major theories in organizational analysis are used in parallel but largely separate conversations . Since both literatures now explore how categorization and cognition affect the variety of organizations and dynamics of organizational environ - ments , the study of categories holds the promise of being a fruitful venue for engaging both traditions in creating new and exciting conversations . We hope our study shows that ideas from both theories can be used together productively . More fundamentally , understanding how micro - and macro - level features of cognition affect reactions to cate - gory blends will require micro - level analysis . Speciﬁcally , techniques of neuroscience hold great promise for under - standing whether and how logics promote measurably different emotional reactions to new ideas . Conclusion The odds of earning approval may be stacked against category - blending inventions , but these odds change as similar but previously unfamiliar blends earn approval and grow in number . That is , the dynamic that discounts category blends also facilitates recognition of new patterns and , ultimately , new categories . This is because the cog - nitive bias against blends is a reﬂection of the cognitive limits that also demand categorization of blends that are encountered increasingly frequently , and the categories that lead us to overlook category misﬁts are both a response to and a reﬂection of cognitive limits . Looking beyond patents and nanotechnology , we believe these insights can be extended to explain the role that category - blending D o w n l o a d e d fr o m i n f o r m s . o r g by [ 128 . 240 . 225 . 44 ] on 21 D ece m b e r 2014 , a t 23 : 57 .

From organizational forms , practices , and strategies to genres , identities , and ﬁelds , changes to any category in a social ontology arise from the collective process of pattern recognition that this research begins to describe . We hope this study will be one of many that take a multilevel approach to understanding how shared views of patterns worth naming emerge and change over time .

Endnotes 1 Cognitive psychologists ( e . g . , Gillund and Shiffrin 1984 , Hintzman 1990 ) have noted that for an individual decision maker , the process of recognizing a new object is based on the object’s summed similarity to categories that are already stored in the decision maker’s memories . 2 Since ideas in patent applications are protected only after approval , a longer review time increases the risk of ideas being discovered and used by others . 3 Refer to http : / / www . its . caltech . edu / ~ feynman / plenty . html . 4 In unreported supplementary analyses , we found that , by itself , typicality has a curvilinear ( U - shaped ) main effect on both of our dependent variables , supporting the logics perspective that contextual factors matter . In fact , in this context , an institutional logic that favors novelty is so strong that being “typical” is not necessarily a blessing . These ﬁndings echo Fleming’s ( 2001 ) work that , although familiar combinations increase the value of and citations received by an invention , repeated combinations also eventually reduce the usefulness of an innovation . Although interesting , further discussion of this point is beyond the scope of the current paper and deserves future research .
