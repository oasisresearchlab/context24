Abstract : Previously , we demonstrated an 81 % reduction in pediatric Emergency Room ( ER ) visits in Italy during the strict lockdown due to the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic . Since May 2020 , lockdown measures were relaxed until 6 November 2020 , when a strict lockdown was patchily reintroduced . Our aim was to evaluate the impact of the relaxed lockdown on pediatric ER visits in Italy . We performed a retrospective multicenter study involving 14 Italian pediatric ERs . We compared total ER visits from 24 September 2020 to 6 November 2020 with those during the corresponding timeframe in 2019 . We evaluated 17 ER speciﬁc diagnoses grouped in air communicable and non - air communicable diseases . We recognized four different triage categories : white , green , yellow and red . In 2020 total ER visits were reduced by 51 % compared to 2019 ( 16 , 088 vs . 32 , 568 , respectively ) . The decrease in air communicable diseases was signiﬁcantly higher if compared to non - air communicable diseases ( − 64 % vs . − 42 % , respectively ) . ER visits in each triage category decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 , but in percentage , white and red codes remained stable , while yellow codes slightly increased and green codes slightly decreased . Our results suggest that preventive measures drastically reduced the circulation of air communicable diseases even during the reopening of social activities but to a lesser extent with regard to the strict lockdown period ( March – May 2020 ) .

Introduction The ﬁrst cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) were described in China in December 2019 and the WHO declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020 [ 1 ] . The ﬁrst Italian case was described in February 2020 . Since that date , a total of 4 , 515 , 967 cases and 128 , 362 deaths ( 2 . 8 % ) were reported in Italy , with a median age of 46 years [ 2 ] . Until 25 August 2021 , 711 , 898 ( 15 . 9 % ) pediatric cases were reported in Italy , with 31 fatalities [ 2 ] . In order to face this pandemic spread , the Italian Prime Minister declared a strict lockdown on 9 March 2020 [ 3 ] . Bans of mass gatherings , social distancing and the obliga - tion of wearing face masks starting at six years of age were introduced . Moreover , simple hygiene measures , such as hand washing , were implemented . Mass closures followed , including schools , factories , pubs , shopping centers and restaurants . Only supermarkets re - mained open , providing daily necessities . Workers were encouraged to use smart - working . Breaking the quarantine was allowed only in case of extreme necessities . These preventive measures were operative until 3 May 2020 , when they were relaxed [ 4 ] : factories , shop - ping malls , pubs and restaurants were reopened , while schools remained closed . People were allowed to leave their home and take summer holidays . From 14 September 2020 to 24 September 2020 , schools were reopened in Italy [ 5 ] , implementing the environmental and surveillance measures in order to face the in - school transmission . The obligation to wear face masks , handwashing and bans of mass gatherings were highlighted as corner - stones in order to prevent the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 in children and , consequently , from children to adults [ 5 ] . In a previous Italian epidemiologic study including 15 hospitals over eight Italian regions , we showed an 81 % decrease in pediatric Emergency Room ( ER ) visits during March – May 2020 compared to the corresponding timeframes in 2019 , with the largest drop affecting air communicable diseases [ 6 ] . The drastic preventive measures applied during the strict lockdown can explain these results [ 6 ] . It would be useful to know what happened when more permissive measures were applied . In this multicentric study , our aim was the evaluation of how the SARS - CoV - 2 pre - ventive strategies , such as social distancing , face masks and hygiene measures , affected pediatric ER visits when lockdown measures were relaxed , allowing the reopening of social activities in Italy . We compared ER visit rates , speciﬁc ER diagnoses and triage categories from 24 September 2020 to 6 November 2020 with the corresponding timeframe in 2019 . 2 . Materials and Methods We performed a retrospective multicentric study involving 14 Italian pediatric ERs , from northern to southern Italy ( Figure 1 ) . We randomly selected 14 public hospitals throughout Italy , thus providing a representative sample of the entire Italian population . We collected data from ERs located in Ancona , Bergamo , Bologna , Catania , Foligno , Frosinone , Latina , Milan , Naples , Rome and Trieste , which represented about 10 % of the total pediatric ERs visits per year in Italy [ 6 ] . We compared two corresponding timeframes in 2019 and 2020 , starting from 24 Septem - ber . In Italy , schools were opened patchily in the different regions , because each region itself decided the dates in which they should be reopened . The reopenings started from the ﬁrst days of September and continued until 24 September . In order to avoid confound - ing factors , we decided to start our analysis on 24 September 2020 , when schools were opened throughout the national territory . For the same reason , we decided to stop our analysis on 6 November 2020 because , since that date , a new legislation was adopted in Italy , establishing a further differentiation between Italian regions based on their pandemic critical features . The classiﬁcation assigned different colors to each region , indicating its SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic background , from the least to the most severe : white , yellow , orange and red . These different features determined different strict lockdown measures , such as different curfew times , obligation to wear face masks outdoors , the opening of Int . J . Environ . Res . Public Health 2021 , 18 , 9547 3 of 11 restaurants and shopping centers and different social activities proceedings , from their complete closure to their opening . Figure 1 . Pediatric Emergency Rooms ( ERs ) included in the study . Firstly , we compared these two reference periods in terms of total visits in the 14 pedi - atric ERs participating in the study . Subsequently , consistent with our previous study [ 6 ] , we evaluated 17 ER speciﬁc diagnoses , based on the primary discharge diagnoses ruled out in ER according to the ICD9 - CM codes . These diagnoses were grouped into air commu - nicable and non - air communicable diseases [ 6 ] . In the group of air communicable diseases , we included upper and lower respiratory infections , gastroenterological infections and exanthematous diseases , and we assumed that these conditions were related to airborne transmission . Non - air communicable diseases included accidents , cardiovascular , derma - tological diseases , endocrinological disorders , fever and surgical pathologies , as well as hematological , nephrological , neurological , neuropsychiatric , oncological , ophthalmolog - ical and rheumatological diseases , because we assumed that these conditions were not related to airborne transmission . Fever was included in this second category because , if it occurs without any other signs or symptoms , it is more likely related to non - airborne infections , such as urinary tract infections . In order to better understand our analysis , we also investigated the trend in respiratory diseases alone compared to the other 16 speciﬁc diagnoses evaluated in this study . Similarly , we recognized four different triage categories , from the least to the most severe : white , green , yellow , and red , which were standardized combining the orange and blue codes as yellow codes , as previously described [ 6 ] . In fact , since 2019 some regions , including Lazio , adopted new triage colors and deﬁned ﬁve new triage categories with different priority codes : red ( immediate access ) , orange ( access in 15 min ) , blue ( access in 60 min ) , green ( access in 120 min ) and white ( access in 240 min ) . To standardize our data , we combined the orange and blue codes as yellow codes . We performed our statistical analysis using IBM SPSS Statistics v . 25 ( IBM Corp . Re - leased 2017 . IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows , Version 25 . 0 . Armonk , NY : IBM Corp . ) . We compared the ER visits rates , ER speciﬁc diagnoses in terms of air communicable diseases and non - air communicable diseases and triage categories in 2019 vs . 2020 by chi - square tests . A p - value < 0 . 05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant . 3 . Results We collected data from 14 Italian pediatric ERs , from 24 September to 6 November , 2019 and 2020 : Umberto I hospital , Rome ( 2901 vs . 1338 ) ; San Camillo de Lellis hospital , Rome ( 1587 vs . 711 ) ; Sant’Eugenio hospital , Rome ( 591 vs . 222 ) ; Santa Maria Goretti hospital , Int .

Comparing total ER visits from 24 September to 6 November 2020 , with those from 24 September to 6 November 2019 , we observed a reduction rate of 51 % ( 32 , 568 vs . 16 , 088 visits , respectively ) ( p < 0 . 001 ) ( Table 1 ) .

Figure 2 . Pediatric ER diagnoses in September – November , 2019 and 2020 . Int . J . Environ . Res . Public Health 2021 , 18 , 9547 5 of 11 Nevertheless , for some categories , such as accidents , we observed a relative increase in percentage when compared to the total number of visits per reference period ( Figure 3 ) . Figure 3 . Proportion of pediatric ER diagnoses in September – November , 2019 and 2020 . The decrease in air communicable diseases ( 13 , 134 vs . 4754 : − 63 . 8 % ) was signiﬁcantly higher compared to non - air communicable diseases ( 19 , 434 vs . 11 , 334 : − 41 . 7 % ) ( p < 0 . 001 ) . Analyzing respiratory diseases alone , we found a statistical signiﬁcantly decrease in respi - ratory diseases ( 6743 vs . 2393 , − 4 % ) compared to the total amount of the others 16 speciﬁc diagnoses evaluated in this study ( 25 , 296 vs . 11 , 667 , + 4 % ) ( p < 0 . 001 ) . ER visits in each triage category decreased in 2020 .

By contrast , considering the proportion of each category over the total number of visits per reference period , the red codes remained almost similar ( 0 . 4 % vs . 0 . 3 % , p = 0 . 85 ) , while the yellow codes increased ( 9 . 4 % vs . 12 . 2 % , p < 0 . 001 ) , green codes decreased ( 77 . 9 % vs . 73 . 9 % , p < 0 . 001 ) , and white codes slightly increased ( 12 . 3 % vs . 13 . 6 % , p < 0 . 001 ) ( Figure 4 ) .

Discussion In our study , evaluating 14 Italian hospitals that are a representative sample of the whole Italian population , the most important result is that total pediatric ER visits dropped by 51 % from 24 September to 6 November 2020 , compared to the corresponding time - frame in 2019 . After demonstrating a signiﬁcant reduction of ER visits during the strict lockdown ( 9 March to 3 May 2020 ) in our previous manuscript [ 6 ] , we rolled out this study in order to assess the effect of relaxed preventing restrictions , such as social activities reopening . We found a signiﬁcantly lower drop in ER visits in September – November 2020 compared to March – May 2020 ( − 51 % vs . − 81 % , respectively ) . Our results are supported by other studies that have demonstrated a drastic fall in ER visits both in children and in adults [ 6 – 13 ] . This drop can be explained by the preventive measures adopted in Italy , such as social - distancing measures , the use of face masks , hand washing and bans of mass gatherings , which may have contributed to the reduction of the spread of both SARS - CoV - 2 and other acute communicable diseases , the most common ER presentations in children along with accidents [ 6 , 7 ] . Moreover , in the present study , we conﬁrmed the reduction in all 17 clinical categories , regarding both air communicable and non - air communicable diseases , but similarly to above , the reduction of air communicable diseases was signiﬁ - cantly lower in September – November 2020 when compared to March – May 2020 ( − 64 % vs . − 88 . 5 % , respectively ) . We can speculate that the reopening of social activities , with the mitigation of lockdown measures in May 2020 and in particular the reopening of schools in September 2020 , at least partially allowed the circulation of air communicable diseases . Our speculations are supported by other studies that have demonstrated an increase in air communicable diseases’ diffusion after the mitigation of lockdown , both in children and in adults [ 14 – 16 ] . By contrast , during the strict lockdown , air communicable diseases’ diffusion was really reduced [ 6 , 16 – 20 ] , leading to a drastic drop in ER visits [ 9 – 11 , 13 ] , as we have already demonstrated in our previous study [ 6 ] . These results highlight the importance of preventive measures in order to face acute communicable diseases’ diffusion , in particular in pediatric age , because several studies have shown that children are at higher risk of infections [ 17 , 18 , 21 ] and are pivotal in air communicable diseases’ transmis - sion [ 22 ] . Our preliminary data , analyzing a one year surveillance period from March 2020 to February 2021 , showed that RSV and other viruses ( including inﬂuenza virus A and B , human coronavirus OC43 , 229E , NL - 63 and HUK1 , adenovirus , parainﬂuenza virus 1 - 3 , human bocavirus and human metapneumovirus ) almost disappeared , while human rhinovirus ( hRV ) was the only detected virus . In fact , evaluating 86 hospitalized children , we found hRV in 41 , RSV in 4 and other viruses in 1 . Interestingly , hRV did not show a peak in spring 2020 as the other epidemic seasons , but in autumn – winter 2020 , it was the one detected in hospitalized children , showing a spread trend comparable to other epidemic seasons . Thus , the relatively low efﬁcacy of surgical masks , along with hRV features and the reduced social distancing in social activities , allowed the circulation of the virus . Every year in Italy , approximately 3 million children are admitted to ERs [ 23 ] . Ap - proximately 0 . 5 – 1 % are classiﬁed as red codes and 10 – 12 % as yellow codes , meaning that approximately 20 , 000 – 30 , 000 children seek medical advice for life - threatening clinical conditions and about 300 , 000 children present with serious conditions each year . Neverthe - less , approximately 70 – 80 % of ER visits are categorized as green codes . This considerable number of non - urgent patients with acute clinical conditions , which could be used to treat with in an outpatient setting , has necessarily led to the well - known and harmful overcrowding of ER departments [ 23 ] . Evaluating triage categories , we demonstrated a consistent reduction in all ER visits . This reduction goes along with the reduction in the spread of air communicable diseases [ 6 , 7 ] and in outdoor accidents [ 6 ] , which represent the most frequent clinical presentations in pediatric ERs . Moreover , we cannot rule out that parents’ fear of SARS - CoV - 2 [ 6 , 8 , 9 , 24 , 25 ] and the strict measures adopted in Italy [ 6 , 8 , 26 ] have contributed to this reduction . Another interesting result that came out comparing our two studies was that in both reference periods , yellow codes increased , and green codes de - creased compared to their corresponding timeframes in 2019 but , in September – November Int . J . Environ . Res . Public Health 2021 , 18 , 9547 7 of 11 2020 , yellow codes increased , and green codes decreased to a lesser extent than March – May 2020 , when lockdown measures were more stringent ( yellow codes : + 11 . 1 % vs . + 2 . 8 % ; green codes : − 10 . 8 % vs . − 4 % , respectively ) [ 6 ] . These results may highlight that a lesser sense of fear concerning SARS - CoV - 2 [ 27 ] and more organized primary cares have limited the number of patients that delayed their ER visits , in contrast to what happened during the ﬁrst wave of pandemic [ 28 – 32 ] . In particular , a more intense sense of fear was demon - strated in people living in high - death - rate countries with strict lockdown measures [ 26 ] . Thus , the mitigation of lockdown measures could have led people to have a lesser sense of fear in respect to SARS - CoV - 2 , avoiding delayed ER visits . An interesting result came out analyzing the trend in ER visits for accidents consider - ing the strict and the relaxed lockdown period . Accidents , together with air communicable diseases , typically represent the main clinical presentation in pediatric ERs [ 6 , 7 ] . In our pre - vious work , comparing the strict lockdown period ( March – May 2020 ) with the same period in 2019 , we demonstrated 11148 ER visits for accidents in 2019 compared to 3380 in 2020 ( − 70 % ) [ 6 ] . Our results were superimposable on other studies that reported reductions in injuries in pediatric age in UK , Germany , Belgium , France , Italy , USA , South Africa and Singapore [ 13 , 17 , 33 – 37 ] . Along this hypothesis , several studies demonstrated a drastic drop in pediatric ER visits for accidents during the lockdown period [ 6 , 38 , 39 ] . This decreasing trend is conﬁrmed also by more recent published works that analyzed different timeframes , in particular until June [ 40 ] and August [ 41 ] 2020 , when strict lockdown measures were patchily reintroduced . In the present work , analyzing ER visits in September – November 2020 , we conﬁrm this decreasing trend in accidents even when lockdown measures were relaxed , allowing several social activities reopening , such as schools . In fact , we found 8384 ER visits for accidents in September – November 2019 compared to 4871 in the same timeframe in 2020 ( − 42 % ) . We can compare accident visits during the strict lockdown and relaxed lockdown period . Interestingly , we found 3380 vs . 4871 accident visits ( + 31 % ) [ 6 ] . We can speculate that , during the strict lockdown , the increased parental supervision and the school , sport activities and playground closures may have played a pivotal role in the reduction of accidental injuries [ 42 ] . However , when strict measures were relaxed , the increase in opportunities for trauma led to an increase in accidents visits . On the other hand , we cannot forget that the home environment remains a frequent place for accidents in children [ 43 , 44 ] . In fact , we found a marked increase in the proportion of injuries both during the strict [ 6 ] and relaxed lockdown periods . An important decision that was made during the relaxed lockdown was the reopening of schools . In fact , an important effect of the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic was school closure that affected thousands of children worldwide for about one year . By 26 April 2020 , the United Nations Education , Scientiﬁc and Cultural Organization ( UNESCO ) estimated that 1 , 451 , 874 , 449 learners were affected globally . Thus , is school closure beneﬁcial ? It is known that the SARS - CoV - 2 infection in children is mostly a mild disease [ 45 ] . However , we cannot forget that children are susceptible in any case to the infection and then they can spread the virus [ 46 , 47 ] . The mild clinical presentation arises concerns about in - school transmission , as children are seen as super spreaders . Several studies highlighted that child contribute minimally to SARS - CoV - 2 growth rates [ 48 – 54 ] . The opening of schools may be considered safe where there is low SARS - CoV - 2 background prevalence . In fact , several data indicate that adults play a crucial role in spreading the virus to their households [ 55 , 56 ] and that in - school SARS - CoV - 2 transmission depends on local background prevalence [ 57 , 58 ] . Thus , improving preventing measures ( such as decreasing class sizes , organizing different timetables , holding lessons outdoors , physical distancing , hygiene measures , face masks and the obligation to stay at home when sick ) are crucial to minimizing the risk of in - class transmission [ 46 , 47 , 59 , 60 ] . It is important to remember that social activities closures can lead to potential harmful consequences for the school - aged population and their families , concerning obesity and malnutrition , immunization rates , domestic violence and child abuse [ 57 ] , delays or precocity in cognitive , physical or social growth , later diagnoses of developmental conditions and overall health inequity [ 61 – 66 ] . Thus , school closures Int . J . Environ . Res . Public Health 2021 , 18 , 9547 8 of 11 should be correctly assessed balancing the risk / beneﬁt ratio , protecting , on the one side , the child health and , on the other side , their crucial growth milestones . This study has some limitations . Social distancing or other preventive strategies were not directly measured in order to evaluate their contribution in reducing the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 and other air communicable infections . We did not investigate the parents’ feelings about keeping their children at home in spite of medical problems due to the fear of the pandemic . We focused the analysis on a period in which lockdown measures were relaxed , and we assumed that these measures , such as social distancing , face masks and hand washing , were followed . 5 . Conclusions Our results suggest that preventive measures , such as face masks , social distancing and simple hygiene measures , were associated with a reduction in air communicable diseases’ spread even during the reopening of social activities and schools in particular but to a lesser extent with respect to the lockdown period ( March – May 2020 ) . The slight percentage increase in yellow codes and the slight percentage decrease in green codes in September – November 2020 compared to lockdown period may indicate an improvement in primary cares and , consequently , a reduction of delayed visits at pediatric ERs .
