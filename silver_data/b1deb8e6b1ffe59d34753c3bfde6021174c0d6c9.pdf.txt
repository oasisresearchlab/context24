Singh * Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology , Center for Molecular Medicine , University of Georgia , Athens , GA , United States Genomic manipulation of human pluripotent stem cells ( hPSCs ) has become essential to introduce genetic modiﬁcations and transgenes , and develop reporter lines . One of the major bottlenecks in gene editing is at the stage of single - cell cloning , which is thought to be variable across hPSC lines and is substantially reduced following a transfection . Due to the difﬁculty of performing ﬂuorescent - assisted cell sorting ( FACS ) for single - cell isolation of hPSCs , previous approaches rely on manual colony picking , which is both time - consuming and labor - intensive . In this protocol , I provide a method for utilizing FACS to generate single - cell clones of hPSCs with efﬁciencies approaching 40 % within 7 – 10 days . This can be achieved by sorting cells onto a feeder layer of MEFs in a stem cell deﬁned medium with KSR and a Rock inhibitor , as early as 1 – 2 days following a transfection , streamlining the gene editing process . The approach described here provides a fundamental method for all researchers utilizing hPSCs for scientiﬁc studies . Keywords : pluripotent stem cells , human embryonic stem cells , induced pluripotent stem cells , single - cell , cloning protocol INTRODUCTION Human pluripotent stem cells ( hPSCs ) , including human embryonic stem cells ( hESCs ) , and induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) , have become an essential cellular model system for research that span the spectrum of studies from developmental biology up through translational and therapeutic investigations ( Yamanaka , 2012 ; Wu and Izpisua Belmonte , 2015 ; Rossant and Tam , 2017 ) . These studies have been enabled , in part , due to considerable improvements in the techniques to passage and grow the cells . Original methods of maintaining hESCs were challenging , relying on manual passaging and growing the cells on feeder layers of mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts ( MEFs ) , or using MEF - conditioned media ( Thomson et al . , 1998 ; Xu et al . , 2001 ; Rosler et al . , 2004 ) . Progress was made by moving away from feeders and using extracellular matrices ( such as Matrigel or Geltrex ) to provide a substrate for cellular attachment ( Xu et al . , 2001 ; Brimble et al . , 2004 ; Carpenter et al . , 2004 ; Rosler et al . , 2004 ) . Furthermore , serum - free , deﬁned media formulations were also developed such as mTESR ( Ludwig et al . , 2006 ) , or HAIF ( Wang et al . , 2007 ; Singh et al . , 2012 ) , which is marketed as StemPRO hESC SFM by Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc . Further reﬁnements to media were also developed to eliminate bovine albumin and reduce media complexity by developing E8 medium ( Chen et al . , 2011 ) . Improvements to manual passaging techniques were also developed . While traditional methods of passaging cells ( trypsin or collagenase ) were found to result in reduced survival , karyotypical abnormalities or spontaneous diﬀerentiation in hESCs ( Buzzard et al . , 2004 ; Draper et al . , 2004 ; Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 1 January 2019 | Volume 7 | Article 11 fcell - 07 - 00011 January 29 , 2019 Time : 17 : 1 # 2 Singh PSC Single - Cell Cloning Mitalipova et al . , 2005 ) , other enzymatic methods ( such as using dispase or accutase ) were found to be more permissive to passaging , especially when used in conjunction with a ROCK inhibitor ( Watanabe et al . , 2007 ) . Non - enzymatic approaches have surfaced more recently by using EDTA - based detachment solutions ( Beers et al . , 2012 ) , or products such as ReLeSR . It should be noted that non - enzymatic approaches typically are more akin to manual passaging , in that cells are passaged as “clumps , ” while enzymatic approaches , such as Accutase or TrypLE Select , permit single - cell disassociation prior to seeding of the cells . Overall , these improvements in growing and passaging hPSCs have facilitated the use of these cells for numerous research disciplines . One of the major challenges for hPSC researchers that still remains is the single - cell cloning of hPSCs at a high eﬃciency , especially when following a transfection . When only a few clones are suﬃcient , manual colony - picking has proven to be an eﬀective approach . However , when > 50 single - cell clones are needed , such as when genetically modifying the cells , manual colony picking is not ideal as the process is both labor - intensive and ineﬃcient . Here , I provide a detailed procedure for the high eﬃciency single - cell cloning of hPSCs . This procedure signiﬁcantly improves current methods for clonal isolation of hPSCs for gene editing studies . MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT Reagents 1 . MEFs ( EMD Millipore , PMEF - N ) . 2 .

PROCEDURE This method for single - cell cloning consists of three stages ( Figure 1 ) . In the ﬁrst stage , you will prepare you cells for single - cell cloning , which is required prior to any genetic manipulation Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 2 January 2019 | Volume 7 | Article 11 fcell - 07 - 00011 January 29 , 2019 Time : 17 : 1 # 3 Singh PSC Single - Cell Cloning FIGURE 1 | The overall scheme for efﬁcient single - cloning of hPSCs . This approach consists of three phases and routinely results in efﬁciencies of ∼ 40 % . of the cells , such as a transfection or transduction . In the second stage , you will perform the seeding of single - cells into 96 - well plates . In the third stage , you will perform passaging and expansion as needed for your subsequent experimental plans . Stage 1 : Adapting hPSCs to Single - Cell Passaging Day 1 : 1 . Pre - coat a 60 mm cell culture dish with 2 ml of Geltrex ( or equivalent ECM , such as Cultrex or Matrigel ) at a 1 / 200 dilution for a minimum of 30 min in a 37 ◦ C cell culture incubator . 2 . Passage your cells using your standard approach , maintaining 1 plate of cells under your current conditions , and a 2nd plate that has been pre - coated with Geltrex in your deﬁned media ( DM ) , such as mTesr1 , StemPRO , or E8 . Seeding density should be at your normal range , such as a 1 : 5 – 1 : 10 ratio if clump passaging . The ﬁrst plate will be used simply for maintaining your cells under current conditions , while the second plate will be used for adapting your cells to single - cell passaging . Days 2 – 4 : 3 . Grow the hPSCs for 3 – 4 days with daily media changes in your DM , until colonies are of a large size ( ∼ 500 µ m diameter ) , but not quite touching and have minimal diﬀerentiation . If necessary , remove any diﬀerentiated cells by scraping with a needle or pipet tip . Day 5 : 4 . Aspirate media from cells and wash cells once with DPBS . 5 . Add 2 ml of room temperature Accutase to the plate and return plate to 37 ◦ C incubator for 3 min , or until cells have detached . 6 . Add 2 ml of DPBS to the plate , transfer to a 15 ml conical tube and centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 4 min . 7 . Aspirate supernatant and add 1 ml of fresh DM and resuspend the cell pellet . 8 . Aspirate Geltrex from a new 60 mm plate and add 3 ml of DM with 1 × RevitaCell to the plate . 9 . Add 200 µ l from the cell suspension ( 1 : 5 ratio ) to the new plate containing DM + RevitaCell . Note : RevitaCell should only be used when initially seeding cells . Y27632 may be used in place of RevitaCell , however , cell viability and survival are much lower . Cells may also have an abnormal morphology in Y27632 – less circular and more spindle - shaped ; however , they will still be fully pluripotent and retain pluripotency markers . Days 6 – 10 : 10 . Change media on the plate daily to DM only and grow for 3 – 4 days until clones are near conﬂuent . Days 11 – 20 : 11 . Repeat steps 4 – 10 , 2 more times , so that cells are fully acclimated to single - cell passaging . 12 . Cells may now be used for any transfection or transduction protocol that you require for your experimental needs , and you may perform single - cell sorting 1 – 2 days following the transfection . We recommend that transfection be optimized for eﬃciency and viability for each cell line that you use , prior to experimentation ( see section “Anticipated Results” ) . Stage 2 : Single - Cell Seeding Day 1 : 1 . Add 0 . 2 % gelatin to 2 – 4 96 - well plates ( 100 µ l / well ) for 15 min at room temperature . 2 . Thaw MEFs and resuspend at a concentration of 1 million cells per 10 ml of MEF medium ( 10 ml per 96 - well plate ) . 3 . Aspirate gelatin from plates . Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 3 January 2019 | Volume 7 | Article 11 fcell - 07 - 00011 January 29 , 2019 Time : 17 : 1 # 4 Singh PSC Single - Cell Cloning 4 . Add MEFs to plate ( 100 µ l / well ) . 5 . Incubate overnight at 37 ◦ C , 5 % CO 2 . Day 2 : 6 . Aspirate media from hESCs / hiPSCs and wash with D - PBS . 7 . Add room temperature Accutase ( 5 ml for 100 mm dish ) and incubate for 3 – 5 min at 37 ◦ C ( until cells are dissociated ) . 8 . Add an equal volume of D - PBS ( 5 ml for 100 mm dish ) , transfer to a 15 ml conical tube and pellet cells . 9 . Resuspend cell pellet in SCC media with RevitaCell ( 1 – 2 million cells / ml ) , and transfer to ﬂow tube . 10 . Aspirate media from 96 - well plates , add SCC media with RevitaCell . Note : Addition of KSR to SCC media is absolutely essential for successful cloning , as it keeps MEFs alive in the stem cell deﬁned medium and dramatically improves cloning eﬃciency . When preparing media , reduce basal media volume ( DMEM - F12 ) to account for increased volume from KSR . Avoid reducing growth factor concentrations ( e . g . , do not simply add 10 % KSR to mTESR1 complete medium , as this would dilute bFGF and TGF - β ) . 11 . Utilize ﬂuorescent - assisted cell sorting ( FACS ) to sort 1 cell / well into 96 - well plates . Note : As an alternative approach , limiting dilution may be used where cells can be diluted to 50 – 100 cells in 10 ml , and 100 µ l be pipetted into each well of a 96 - well plate . 12 . Return cells to incubator . Days 3 – 9 : 13 . Aspirate media from plate . 14 . Add fresh SCC media ( do NOT include RevitaCell ) . 15 . Continue to change media every other day up until day 7 , and then change media daily until PSC colonies are of suﬃcient size . 16 . Starting at day 9 ( 7 days after FACS ) , evaluate plates for number of colonies and colony size . Draw circles around wells with 1 colony only . Note : As colonies are being grown on MEFs , if clones become overgrown there will be an increased tendency for unwanted diﬀerentiation . Minor amounts of diﬀerentiation are usually not problematic , and will be reduced during Accutase passaging . Stage 3 : Passaging and Expansion Day 12 ( approximately , depending on colony size ) : 17 . Geltrex coat 1 – 2 96 well plates , depending on the number of colonies , incubate for 30 min at 37 ◦ C . 18 . Wash 96 - well plates containing PSC colonies in DPBS and add Accutase ( 50 µ l / well ) to colony - containing wells , return to incubator until colonies are detached . Note : Larger colonies take a longer to detach – carefully view cell detachment under a microscope . 19 . Add 150 µ l of DM to the wells containing Accutase . Note : Do not use DPBS instead of DM , cell will attach better to the plate during centrifugation in DM than DPBS . 20 . Aspirate geltrex from 96 - well coated plates and transfer cell suspension from each well to an independent well . Centrifuge entire plate at 1000 rpm for 4 min . Visualize that cell have successfully attached to wells . 21 . Very carefully aspirate media from wells , being sure not to dislodge cells and add fresh DM with RevitaCell . Days 13 – 18 : 22 . Change medium daily with DM only . 23 . When wells are conﬂuent , Accutase passage cells as before ( steps 17 – 21 above ) and transfer cells using 1 / 5 ratio ( i . e . , 40 µ l of the a 200 µ l cell suspension ) to the new plate . 24 . Transfer the remaining 160 µ l of your cell suspension to a 96 - well plate for your downstream analysis , such as genotyping by PCR . Cells maybe be pelleted and stored in − 20 ◦ C for collecting genomic DNA . 25 . After genotyping is complete . Correct clones should expanded ﬁrst to 24 - well plate , then to 6 - well plate , and cells should be frozen for long - term storage in liquid N 2 as soon as possible . ANTICIPATED RESULTS We have been using this procedure extensively for clonal isolation of hPSC following genomic manipulation , as early as 1 – 2 days following a transfection for several research projects including gene knockouts , reporter knock - in and developing stable , ectopically expressed cell lines . In one example , we have used this approach to delete a putative enhancer of interest ( Figure 2 ) . Two CRISPR / Cas9 - GFP plasmids ( Addgene , PX458 ) containing gRNAs that target each side of a putative enhancer were transfected by electroporation ( Neon Transfection System , Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) into hPSCs ( Figure 2A ) . Cells were subsequently sorted at 2 - days post - transfection by GFP onto 96 - well plates containing MEFs or Geltrex ( Figures 2B , C ) . Using the above described procedure , we obtained single - cell cloning eﬃciencies ranging from 35 to 40 % on MEFs . After subsequent colony expansion , 10 clones were screened for deletion of the enhancer and compared to the untransfected control , of which 2 clones exhibited bi - allelic enhancer deletion ( Figure 2D ) . In general , we have also found the results of this single - cell cloning approach to be largely comparable using independent lines of hESCs and iPSCs . In total , we have used this method on > 10 Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 4 January 2019 | Volume 7 | Article 11 fcell - 07 - 00011 January 29 , 2019 Time : 17 : 1 # 5 Singh PSC Single - Cell Cloning FIGURE 2 | Utilization of feeder layers are more efﬁcient than basement membrane matrices when single - cell cloning hPSCs with RevitaCell and KSR following a transfection . ( A ) Diagram depicting the targeting site for each CRISPR / Cas9 GFP plasmids and predicted results following genomic deletion . Primer sequences are indicated by arrows . ( B ) Two days following an electroporation of the CRISPR / Cas9 plasmids , hPSCs were seeded by FACS as single - cells onto 96 - well plates coated with Geltrex ( 1 / 100 dilution ) or pre - seeded with MEFs ( 1 million cells / 96 - well plate ) using three replicate conditions . ( C ) Single - cell cloning ( SCC ) efﬁciency following the FACS isolation of transfected cells . ( D ) Genomic screening by PCR using indicated primers to identify the deletion of the enhancer . hPSC lines including common lines such as WA09 and K3 iPSCs , along with in - house developed iPSC lines . The major improvement with this protocol over others is in the use of a MEF feeder layer with a deﬁned media plus KSR supplementation , along with RevitaCell , during the single - cell sorting following a transfection . We have been able to obtain roughly 3 – 4 times higher eﬃciency with this protocol using MEF feeder layers , than that with a DM plus RevitaCell on Geltrex ( Figure 2C ) . This indicates that in the absence of a MEF feeder layer , single - cell cloning eﬃciency , speciﬁcally following a transfection , will be considerably reduced . Indeed we have found higher single - cell cloning eﬃciencies in un - transfected cells ( > 25 % ) on Geltrex plus RevitaCell alone . While other studies have suggested eﬃciencies ranging from 30 to 40 % using a DM with RevitaCell on Geltrex ( Chen and Pruett - Miller , 2018 ) , these studies do not take into account the reduced viability following transfections by electroporation or lipofection . Thus , our procedure of sorting onto MEFs in an hPSC - DM and KSR with a Rock inhibitor overcomes the obstacle of reduced viability following a transfection to facilitate high - eﬃciency single - cell cloning . We have experimented with several diﬀerent transfection reagents including , electroporation using the Neon ( Life Technologies ) , Amaxa Nucleofector II and 4D - Nucleofector ; and lipofection using Lipofectamine - 3000 ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) , Lipofectamine Stem Reagent ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) , and TransIT - 2020 ( Mirus Bio ) . In all cases , we have noticed a trade - oﬀ between transfection eﬃciency and cell viability , with higher transfection eﬃciencies resulting in lower viability for several diﬀerent hESC and iPSC lines . We have found that cell viability is consistently reduced following these transfection approaches compared to un - transfected cells , and always results in lower single - cell cloning eﬃciency on Geltrex or Matrigel than on MEFs . Using the Neon electroporation system with 2 million cells and 8 µ g of DNA ( 1050v pulse voltage , 30 ms pulse width , 2 pulses ) we were able to obtain 7 % GFP positive cells ( Figure 2C ) with a homemade hPSC line . We have found that transfection eﬃciencies must be optimized for each hPSC line . For example , with the hPSC line used in Figure 2 , electroporation was far more eﬃcient than lipofection , the latter of which only resulted in 1 – 2 % eﬃciency with the Lipofectamine Stem Reagent . However , with WA09 ( H9 ) hESCs we have routinely obtained 20 % transfection eﬃciency , using the Neon system , but > 30 % with Lipofectamine Stem Reagent . Overall , from using the Neon electroporation method with CRISPR / Cas9 plasmids , and this single - cell cloning procedure , we were able to obtain a DNA editing eﬃciency of 20 % ( Figure 2D ) . Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology | www . frontiersin . org 5 January 2019 | Volume 7 | Article 11 fcell - 07 - 00011 January 29 , 2019 Time : 17 : 1 # 6 Singh PSC Single - Cell Cloning Another major advantage of our protocol is its versatility . A user can use any deﬁned medium that they currently use with their cells , and then supplement that with KSR plus RevitaCell to allow for single - cell sorting onto MEFs . We have successfully used our approach in diﬀerent types of deﬁned media including mTeSR1 , E8 , and STEMPRO hESC SFM , without noticing any major diﬀerences in cloning eﬃciencies . This provides a cost - reduction that would be associated with buying diﬀerent types of deﬁned media . Furthermore , by using a stem cell deﬁned media as their “base growth conditions , ” this enables researchers to switch their cells from diﬀerent attachment substrates ( MEFs , Geltrex , etc . ) with ease . As indicated by our protocol , the hPSCs are moved oﬀ from MEFs and back onto Geltrex as soon as the individual colonies are of suﬃciency size ( < 2 weeks ) . A ﬁnal advantage of our system is the ability to avoid manual picking of colonies following a transfection . Manual picking of 50 – 100 colonies could take as much as an hour or more , especially for inexperienced users , while clonal isolation by FACS can be done in minutes . While manual passaging of hPSCs is not a common procedure anymore , manual picking of transfected clones still represents a common approach , especially for gene editing applications ( Blair et al . , 2016 ; Kwart et al . , 2017 ; Wang et al . , 2017 ; Howden et al . , 2018 ; Tidball et al . , 2018 ) . By using this approach , single - cell sorting hPSCs by FACS following a transfection can be done with ease and clones may be expanded for genomic screening . One caveat to this method is with the use of feeders , and particularly MEFs . Previous reports have suggested that culturing hESCs on MEFs may have negative consequences , as MEFs may be contaminated with retroviruses ( Cobo et al . , 2008 ) . Furthermore , the use of MEFs , although only transiently , does not lend itself to a xenogeneic - free methodologies , which may not be ideal for therapeutic utility of hPSCs . Although , we have not tested human cells for feeders , previous reports have suggested that human ﬁbroblasts provide superior feeder layers to MEFs ( Cobo et al . , 2008 ; Mali et al . , 2008 ) . Human ﬁbroblasts may therefore provide a useful cell type for single - cell cloning applications that necessitate xeno - free conditions . Our ﬁndings that hPSCs survive better on MEFs than on basement membranes alone , such as Geltrex , even in the presence of ROCK inhibitors , raises the question of why this might be the case . One explanation for this is a “neighbor model , ” where hPSCs survive better with neighboring cells than in isolation . In support of this , was the long - standing notion that hPSCs must be passaged as “clumps , ” using manual passaging , collagenase , or more recently using non - enzymatic EDTA - based approaches ( Chen et al . , 2011 ) , for optimal cell adherence and survival . The addition of ROCK inhibitor greatly improved the adherence of hESCs , preventing apoptosis , following single - cell passaging ( Watanabe et al . , 2007 ) . We have found that single - cell cloning eﬃciency can still be low with ROCK inhibitor , however , following a transfection , but can be signiﬁcantly improved when MEFs are present . The “neighbor model” suggests that survival signals beyond immediate adherence may be needed for a single cell to propagate and form a colony ( Phadnis et al . , 2015 ) . These signals may include the sensing of neighboring cells and cytokines / chemokines , along with subsequent migration ( Phadnis et al . , 2015 ) . We speculate that the MEF feeder layer used in our system provide additional survival signals , akin to neighboring hPSCs , beyond those provided by the ECM / ROCK inhibitor combination , thereby improving single - cell cloning outcomes , especially when cell viability is reduced following a transfection . In sum , we have described a single - cell cloning procedure for hPSCs that enables high eﬃciency following a transfection , that is simple and straightforward to use , and that does not necessitate signiﬁcant cost increases , such as the purchase of new equipment . This protocol should therefore result in enhanced research workﬂows for all pluripotent stem cell researchers .
