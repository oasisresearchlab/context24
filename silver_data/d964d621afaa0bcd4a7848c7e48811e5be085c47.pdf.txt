Here , we aimed to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of pediatric post - COVID in a population - based sample , stratifying by serological status . Children from the SEROCoV - KIDS cohort study ( State of Geneva , Switzerland ) , aged 6 months to 17 years , were tested for anti - SARS - CoV - 2 N antibodies ( December 2021 - February 2022 ) and parents ﬁ lled in a questionnaire on persistent symptoms in their children ( lasting over 12 weeks ) compatible with post - COVID . Of 1034 children tested , 570 ( 55 . 1 % ) were seropositive . The sex - and age - adjusted prevalence of persistent symptoms among seropositive children was 9 . 1 % ( 95 % CI : 6 . 7 ; 11 . 8 ) and 5 . 0 % ( 95 % CI : 3 . 0 ; 7 . 1 ) among seronegatives , with an adjusted prevalence difference ( Δ aPrev ) of 4 . 1 % ( 95 % CI : 1 . 1 ; 7 . 3 ) . Stratifying per age group , only adolescents displayed a substantial risk of having post - COVID symptoms ( Δ aPrev = 8 . 3 % , 95 % CI : 3 . 5 ; 13 . 5 ) . Identi ﬁ ed risk factors for post - COVID syndrome were older age , having a lower socioeconomic status and suffering from chronic health conditions , especially asthma . Our ﬁ ndings show that a signi ﬁ cant proportion of seropositive children , particularly ado - lescents , experienced persistent COVID symptoms . While there is a need for further investigations , growing evidence of pediatric post - COVID urges early screening and primary care management . Evidence to date indicates that children , like adults , can experience post - COVIDsyndrome , alsoknown aslong COVID , with possibly major consequences on daily life 1 , 2 . The scienti ﬁ c community agreed on its de ﬁ nition in the pediatric population in March 2022 3 : “ Post - COVID - 19 condition occurs in young people with a history of con ﬁ rmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection , with at least one persisting physical symptom for a minimum duration of 12weeks after initial testing that impacts everyday functioning and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis ” . Many uncertainties remain regarding its prevalence , diagnosis , duration and treatment 4 , 5 , partly due to clinical and methodological challenges . For example , there had been a lack of an of ﬁ cial and stan - dardized post - COVID de ﬁ nition in the pediatric population until very recently and a strong heterogeneity in study design and population across studies since the beginning of the pandemic 6 , 7 . In a recent sys - tematic review 4 ( 22 studies from 12 countries including 23 , 141 children and adolescents , of which ﬁ ve studies had population - based control groups ) , the prevalence of post - COVID symptoms ( lasting more than Received : 5 September 2022 Accepted : 1 November 2022 Check for updates A full list of af ﬁ liations appears at the end of the paper . * A list of authors and their af ﬁ liations appears at the end of the paper . e - mail : Idris .

This prevalence was lower than suggested by other studies that did not use control groups 5 , which may be due to several explanations . First , many children might experience long - lasting symptoms due to other viruses or medical eventsorduetothegeneralstressfulpandemicenvironment . Therefore , differentiating symptoms linked speci ﬁ cally to a SARS - CoV - 2 infection from other diagnoses using a control group of non - infected persons is paramount to avoid overestimation of post - COVID syndrome pre - valence . Second , moststudiesonpost - COVIDsyndromerelyonsamples of con ﬁ rmed infection ( RT - PCR and antigen tests ) 4 , 8 hence excluding asymptomatic cases and underestimating the proportion of infected children and adolescents as this population was not systematically tes - ted . Serological data allow to precisely estimate the proportion of infected children and adolescents by including asymptomatic and mild cases . Accordingly , the difference of prevalence between seropositives and seronegatives can provide an accurate estimator of post - COVID syndrome prevalence and / or unexpected complications such as acute hepatitis in the general pediatric population . The most frequently declared pediatric post - COVID symptoms are fatigue , headache , short - nessof breath , chroniccoughand myalgiawithahigherrisk amonggirls and adolescents 5 . Adults also develop similar symptoms , including per - sistent cough , fever , headache , chest pain , hair loss , loss of taste and smell , amongst many others 9 . Inadditiontotheuncertaintiespreviouslymentioned , onlyveryfew studies have so far analysed risk factors of pediatric post - COVID syn - drome . A large body of literature has shown the adverse effects of low socioeconomic conditions on several health outcomes 10 . Similar mechanisms could be expected in the pediatric post - COVID population . In this study , we aimed to assess the prevalence of persistent symptoms lasting over 12 weeks after a SARS - CoV - 2 infection com - paring seropositive children and adolescents with their seronegative counterparts , using a representative sample of the general population of the canton of Geneva . We also aimed to identify risk factors for experiencing persistent symptoms . Results Descriptive results Among 3060 households , 625 households participated in our study ( participation rate of 20 . 4 % ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Our sample included 1034 children aged 6months to 17years from 612 households : 505 ( 49 % ) were girls and the mean age was 10 . 2 years [ SD = 4 . 2 ] . Overall , 785 ( 76 % ) referent parents had a tertiary education , 200 ( 19 % ) a secondaryeducation and 42 ( 4 % ) had a primary education level ( seven missing data ) . Among our participants , 150 ( 15 % ) were reported to live in a household with an average to poor ﬁ nancial situation ; and 270 ( 26 % ) were reported to have a chronic medical condition ( Table 1 , S1 ) . There were 570 ( 55 % ) children who tested positive for anti - SARS - CoV - 2 N antibodies . Overall , weobserved that 253 ( 24 % ) had a documented con ﬁ rmed COVID - 19 infection , and 198 ( 19 % ) declared an episode of acute symptoms that could be con - sidered as a symptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Among the 79 ( 8 % ) children who had experienced persistent COVID - 19 - related symptoms lasting over 12 weeks since the beginning of the pandemic , 54 ( 68 % ) were seropositive and 25 ( 32 % ) were seronegative . Compared to seronegatives , seropositive children tended to experience more often symptoms such as abdominal pain , trouble concentrating , smell loss , dripping nose , muscle pain , breathing dif ﬁ - culties , headache and constipation . In contrast , seronegative children weredeclaredashavingmoreanxiety , lowermoodanddermatological symptoms ( skin rash ) . Only abdominal pain , smell loss and constipa - tion were signi ﬁ cantly more common in seropositive subjects ( Fig . 2 , Table S4 ) . The severity of symptoms lasting over 12 weeks was on average slightly higher among seropositive children ( mean [ sd ] = 4 . 9 [ 2 . 5 ] ) compared to seronegative subjects ( mean [ sd ] = 4 . 2 [ 2 . 5 ] ) , although not statistically signi ﬁ cant ( p - value = 0 . 1 ) ( Table 1 ) . Among the 54 ( 9 . 5 % ) seropositive children who suffered from symptoms lasting over 12weeks ( Table S2 ) , 31 ( 57 % ) were adolescents aged 12 – 17years . Acon ﬁ rmedinfectionwasdocumentedin30 / 54 ( 56 % ) and 26 / 54 ( 48 % ) reported acute symptoms at the time of infection . Adjusted prevalence of persistent symptoms overall and strati - ﬁ ed by age The adjusted prevalence of persistent symptoms among seropositive and seronegative children was 9 . 1 % ( 95 % CI : 6 . 7 ; 11 . 8 ) and 5 . 0 % ( 95 % CI : 3 . 0 ; 7 . 1 ) , respectively . The corresponding adjusted prevalence differ - ence ( Δ aPrev ) was 4 . 1 % ( 95 % CI : 1 . 1 ; 7 . 3 ) . After strati ﬁ cation by age groups , the prevalence of post - COVID syndrome was higher among adolescents ( 8 . 3 % , 95 % CI : 3 . 5 ; 13 . 5 ) than among younger children ( 0 . 0 % , 95 % CI : − 5 . 2 ; 5 . 2 among 6 – 11 years old and 4 . 2 % ; 95 % CI : − 4 . 4 ; 13 . 3 among 0 – 5years old ) ( Table 2 ) , in which no difference was observed . After strati ﬁ cation by sex , the prevalence within females was of 3 . 4 % ( 95 % CI : 1 . 1 ; 8 . 4 ) and in males , of 4 . 7 % ( 95 % CI : 0 . 2 ; 9 . 4 ) . Risk factors for persistent symptoms Sex - and age - adjusted prevalence ratios were estimated for symptoms lasting over 12 weeks . Older age ( aPR 1 . 1 , 95 % CI : 1 . 0 ; 1 . 2 , continuous variable ) , being seropositive ( aPR 1 . 8 , 95 % CI : 1 . 2 ; 2 . 8 ) , suffering from a chronic condition ( aPR 3 . 6 , 95 % CI : 2 . 3 ; 5 . 5 ) and living in a household with an average to poor ﬁ nancial situation ( aPR 2 . 5 , 95 % CI : 1 . 4 ; 4 . 6 ) were risk factors for experiencing persistent symptoms . Sex was not associated with long lasting symptoms ( aPR 1 . 1 , 95 % CI : 0 . 8 ; 1 . 6 ) . In a sub - analysis restricted to seropositive participants ( N = 570 ) , we also observed that the risk factors associated with persistent symptoms were older age ( aPR 1 . 1 , 95 % CI : 1 . 0 ; 1 . 2 ) , suffering from a chronic condition ( aPR 3 . 5 , 95 % CI : 2 . 0 ; 6 . 1 ) and living in a household with an average to poor ﬁ nancial situation ( aPR 3 . 0 , 95 % CI : 1 . 5 ; 6 . 2 ) . Lower level of parental education was related to a higher risk of per - sistentsymptoms , althoughnotstatisticallysigni ﬁ cant ( Table3 ) . Based on the adjusted difference of frequency ( % ) of chronic health condi - tions within children experiencing 12 weeks persistent symptoms ( n = 40 ) , we observed a signi ﬁ cant positive difference between ser - opositives and seronegatives only with asthma ( Table S3 ) . Discussion Our results showed that a signi ﬁ cant proportion of children and ado - lescents suffered from persistent symptoms compatible with post - COVID syndrome . The overall estimated prevalence in the pediatric population was about 4 % . Stratifying per age group , only adolescents displayed a substantial risk of having post - COVID symptoms . Risk factors for post - COVID syndrome were older age , having a lower socioeconomic status and suffering from chronic health conditions , especially asthma .

The esti - mated overall prevalence of post - COVID syndrome in our sample is high , yet lowerthan inotherstudies 4 . Theremight bemultiplereasons . First , designs , samples and characteristics of post - COVID varied con - siderably across studies . Second , our data included mildly sympto - matic and asymptomatic children and , therefore , a greater number of infected children than when relying on con ﬁ rmed infection alone as testing was never systematic in children . Third , we worked with a population - based sample rather than clinical registries . Finally , a pro - portion of seropositive children in our sample might have been infected too recently making it impossible to studied long term per - sistent symptoms . Our data showed a meaningful difference in prevalence between children > 12years and younger individuals , in agreement with the study by Stephenson et al . 5 We could expect this proportion to be higher in reality as parents might not be aware of all of their children ’ s symptoms ; adolescents may be less open about their issues since they are in a period of their life seeking more independence . The prevalence difference between seronegatives and ser - opositives ( ~ 8 % ) in adolescents is worth investigating as it potentially represents a very high absolute number , although lower than in adults 11 . Post - COVID syndrome might worsen adolescents ’ lives , already negatively impacted by the general pandemic environment 12 , 13 and could exacerbate long - term negative consequences on health , social and academic outcomes . On the contrary , we did not observe signi ﬁ cant differencesbetweenseronegativeandseropositivechildren < 12years 14 . The lack of difference in reported persistent symptoms in children < 12 years could be partly explained by the relatively small sample size and by symptoms often developed after common respiratory infections other than SARS - CoV - 2 in this age range . The pandemic - related dif ﬁ culties to meet psychological and physical developmental needs may have been exacerbated by persis - tent symptoms , further preventing children from going about their daily activities and worsening their mental health . Most declared per - sistent symptoms among seropositives were abdominal pain , trouble concentrating , smell loss , dripping nose , muscle pain , breathing dif ﬁ - culties , headache and constipation , in agreement with the recent literature 4 , 15 , 16 . The severity of symptoms reported by parents was , on average , slightly higher in seropositive children , suggesting that per - sistent symptoms following a SARS - CoV - 2 infection might be more severe and represent a more substantial burden on their daily life 14 , 17 . Sheretal . underlinedthatdepressivesymptomsappeartobecommon in patients with post - COVID syndrome . Long - term medical and psy - chological consequences of post - COVID syndrome could drastically worsen mental health and even increase suicidal ideation and behaviors 18 . Similar outcomes could be expected in the pediatric population , especially in adolescents . Post - COVID syndrome should not be underestimated in children and calls for appropriate medical strategies including reinforcing vaccination strategies 19 . In an analysis restricted to seropositives , children from house - holds with lower socioeconomic status were more likely to experience post - COVID syndrome . This is in line with the growing literature on health inequalities of the COVID - 19 pandemic in terms of incidence , testing and severity of the infection 20 . Those inequalities could be explainedbydifferentialexposuretothevirus , greatersusceptibilityto infection , stronger comorbidities in vulnerablegroups associated with severe outcomes , and disparities in healthcare . Similar mechanisms could explain the greater exposure of vulnerable children to the post - COVID syndrome . Also , it is reasonable to highlight that COVID - 19 vaccination uptake was more frequent among individuals with higher socioeconomic status and is considered as the major protection against an acute or severe SARS - CoV - 2 infection , hence developing a post - COVID syndrome 21 .

In general , asthmatic children have a higher risk of respiratory infections . However , the association between asthma and SARS - CoV - 2 infection remains unclear in the pediatric population , as many large - scale ecological studies presented reduced pediatric asthma during the pandemic likely due to physical distancing , masks , and perhaps decreases in air pollution . On the other hand , other researchfocused ontheindividuallevelandpresented asthmaasarisk factor for hospitalization in children with COVID - 19 , but not for worse COVID - 19 outcomes 22 , 23 . The major strength of our study is the population - based design with a wide age range , covering from babies to adolescents . Only very few studies on post - COVID syndrome rely on random population samplesandinclude childrenof thisagerange 4 . Weidenti ﬁ ed previous SARS - CoV - 2 infections relying on serological data , which also detects previous asymptomatic and mild infection . Unlike studies relying on test - con ﬁ rmed infections , which suffer from selection bias , relying on serological assessment yields a better estimation of the proportion of the infected population . However , the use of serological data also poses challenges . In particular , it is impossible to determine the exact date of infection only relying on this data 5 . Our estimates are therefore based on a comparison of children with and without anti - SARS - CoV - 2 anti - bodies , using a control group to avoid overestimating the pre - valence of post - COVID symptoms . Although the diagnosis of post - COVID condition related to persistent symptoms could not be medically assessed by excluding all other alternative diagnoses , the comparison between seropositive and seronegative children enabled to control for the occurrence of persistent symptoms unrelated to a SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Once again , this highlights the importance of a control group and the complexity of identifying the post - COVID syndrome methodologically and clinically . Further - more , despite the fact that some parents were probably aware of their children ’ s exposure status when answering the questionnaire due to con ﬁ rmed COVID - 19 diagnosis or a symptomatic infection , relying on serological tests mitigates the bias of parents over - reporting persistent symptoms when knowing their child ( ren ) had been infected 24 . Our study also has several limitations . Data were parent - reported and their answers could be in ﬂ uenced by their own experience or the household environment . Also , they might not be aware of some of their children ’ s symptoms , particularly for adolescents . Furthermore , as the time of infection and the date of onset persistent symptoms were unknown inmany cases , weare not ableto study the incident risk of post - COVID , for which another study design including the time of the infection and a follow - up would be necessary . Moreover , we can - not exclude that some children might suffer from long - lasting symp - toms due to Omicron infection but were not identi ﬁ ed as such in our analysis as they had not reached the 12 - week threshold that we used to de ﬁ nepersistentsymptoms .

Article https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 022 - 34616 - 8 Nature Communications | ( 2022 ) 13 : 7086 4 Despite the high number of randomly recruited children from a wide age range , the participation rate was relatively low , although in line with participations rates in children cohort in other countries 25 . In addition to the general challenge of recruiting children in population - based cohort 26 , we faced the additional dif ﬁ culty that parents were often reluctant to have their children , especially young ones , undergo a blood draw for research purposes only . We also noticed that some parents were tired of hearing about the pandemic , which also repre - sented a strong barrier to recruitment . Finally , individuals with favor - able socio - economic conditions were more likely to participate . This could have led to an underestimation of the prevalence of post - COVID since their occurrence was more common among underprivileged individuals . Overall , this might limit the representativeness of our results . It would be interesting to study persistent symptoms in children and adolescents who were more recently affected with the Omicron variant as less virulent variants could potentially lead to lower pre - valence of post - COVID . Our study contributes to a better understanding of post - COVID in the pediatric population . The impact of COVID - 19 vaccination could not be assessed and further studies should explore if prior vaccination reduces the risk of developing post - COVID . A signi ﬁ cant proportion of children experienced post - COVID symptoms lasting over 12 weeks after infection with an estimated prevalence of 4 % overall and 8 % in adolescents . Older age , having a chronicconditionandlivingonahouseholdwithlowersocioeconomic conditions were identi ﬁ ed as risk factors for the post - COVID syn - drome . Our understanding of post - COVID syndrome will likely evolve as scienti ﬁ c evidence grows . Nevertheless , it is fundamental to rapidly implement effective primary care management , including early screening and detection , and health promotion to assist children and adolescents suffering from this syndrome who might experience long term physical and mental adverse consequences . Methods Study design and data collection Data are drawn from the SEROCoV - KIDS study , an ongoing , long - itudinal and prospective cohort study , which aims at monitoring and evaluating direct and indirect impacts of the COVID - 19 pandemic on the health and development of children and adolescents . Children and adolescents ’ eligibility criteria included ( 1 ) being between 6 months and 17years old , ( 2 ) residing in the Canton of Geneva at the time of enrollment , and ( 3 ) either being newly selected from random samples obtained from state registries or having a household member already participating in a population - based COVID - 19 seroprevalence study conducted by our group 27 – 29 . These population - based samples were provided by the Swiss Federal Statis - tical Of ﬁ ce ( FSO ) . At the baseline assessment , all children were invited to perform a serological test ( by blood drawing ) to measure anti - SARS - CoV - 2 anti - bodies ( anti - N ) . One of the parent or legal guardian ( referent parent ) was asked to ﬁ ll out online questionnaires ( see supplementary mate - rial ) related to health and development for him / herself and for each of his / her children , on the Specchio - COVID19 secured digital platform 30 . The Geneva Cantonal Commission for Research Ethics approved this study ( ID 2021 - 01973 ) . Referent parents of participants , as well as adolescents aged 14years or older , provided written informed con - sent . Younger children provided oral consent . The baseline assessment consisted of a blood sample for ser - ological testing and online questionnaires . Non - respondents received email reminders 4 , 7 and 21days after the ﬁ rst questionnaire invitation and up to two phone calls were made . The data were collected using the softwares Formstack® ( 02 . 2022 ) and sugarCRM® ( version 4 . 2 ) . Study population The baseline assessment of the SEROCoV - KIDS cohort took place from December 1st , 2021 to April 30th , 2022 . We decided to restrict our analyses by excluding post - COVID syndrome after Omicron infection . Considering that post - COVID is by de ﬁ nition symptoms persisting at least 3 months after the infection , and that Omicron variants ( BA . 1 / BA . 2 ) became dominant in Switzerland at the end of December 2021 , with a surge of COVID - 19 in children in January 2022 , we included exclusively children recruited between December 1st , 2021 and February 16th , 2022 . These participants include those reporting post - COVIDsymptoms who wouldhave had their infection prior to these dates , and thus prior to the Omicron surge . Children for whom we failed to take a blood sample were excluded from this analysis . Symptoms evaluation At baseline , parents were systematically asked if their child ( ren ) had suffered from symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks since the beginning of the pandemic , no matter their SARS - CoV - 2 infectious status ( Supplement ) .

Parents had to report the approximate date of the start of persistent symptoms . They could select symptoms from an exhaustive list of COVID - 19 - related symptoms based on a literature review at the time of the questionnaire design and revised by a group of expert physicians on post - COVID . The persistent symptoms were grouped into seven general categories : general , respiratory , gastrointestinal , cardio - vascular , musculoskeletal , neurological and dermatological symp - toms . The severity of persistent symptoms was then evaluated by asking parents “ considering the most severe symptom of the epi - sode , to what extent did this symptom affect the child ’ s daily life ( on a scale of 1 very weak limitation — 10 strong limitation ) ” . Parents were not aware of their child ( ren ) serological test results while answering the questionnaire . SARS - CoV - 2 infection Con ﬁ rmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection was de ﬁ ned from a positive SARS - CoV - 2 test ( RT - PCR or antigen tests ) reported by parents , along with the date of the ﬁ rstpositive test . Parent couldalsodeclare whether the child ( ren ) had experience an episode of acute symptoms thatcould be considered as a symptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( con ﬁ rmed symptomatic infection ) . Serological tests were based on the semi - quantitative commercially - available immunoassay Roche Elecsys anti - SARS - CoV - 2 N , detecting total Ig ( including IgG ) against the nucleo - capsid protein of the SARS - CoV - 2 virus . Seropositivity was de ﬁ ned using the manufacturer ’ s cut - off of index ≥ 1 . 0 31 . The test has an in - house sensitivity of 99 . 8 % ( 95 % CrI , 99 . 4 % – 100 % ) and speci ﬁ city of 99 . 1 % ( 95 % CI , 98 . 3 – 99 . 7 % ) ( Roche Diagnostics , Rotkreuz , Switzerland ) . Roche Anti - N assays maintained high sensitivity over time and were identi ﬁ ed as appropriate tool for screening infection 31 and anti - N antibodies have been shown to also persist in time in pediatric populations 32 , 33 . The antibodies detected by this test ( anti - N antibodies ) are pro - duced following an infection but not following vaccinationwith mRNA vaccines . At the time of the study , the two authorized vaccines in Switzerland were the mRNA - 1273 from Moderna / US NIAID 34 and the mRNA - BNT162b2 / Comirnaty - 35 from P ﬁ zer / BioNTech6 . Both elicit a response exclusively to the S protein of SARS - CoV - 2 , as opposed to natural infections , which typically elicit a response to both the N and S virus proteins . Other characteristics Other variables were described , including sociodemographic char - acteristics such as age , sex , parental education and household ﬁ nancial status . Parental education ( based on the referent parent ) was categor - ized into three groups : primary education ( compulsory schooling ) , secondary education ( apprenticeship and high school ) and tertiary education ( universitary studies ) . Household ﬁ nancial status was de ﬁ ned as “ average to poor ” if the referent parent chose one of the following statements about their ﬁ nancial situation : “ I have to be careful with my expensesandanunexpectedeventcouldputmeinto ﬁ nancialdif ﬁ culty ” or “ I cannot cover my needs with my income and I need external sup - port ” . If the referent parent had selected the following statement “ I am comfortably off , money is not a concern and it is easy for me to save ” or “ My income covers my expenses and covers any minor contingencies ” abouttheirhousehold ﬁ nancialsituationwasde ﬁ nedas “ good ” . Referent parents werealsoasked if their child ( ren ) suffered from achronichealth condition , de ﬁ nedasamedical / physicalconditiondiagnosedbyahealth professional that lasted ( or was expected to last ) > 6months . Statistical analysis We compared sociodemographic and health - related characteristics between children who tested positive for anti - SARS - CoV - 2 N anti - bodies and children who tested negative , overall and strati ﬁ ed into threeagegroups ( 0 – 5 , 6 – 11and12 – 17yearsold ) usingChi - squaredand Student - t tests , as appropriate . We used marginal prediction after logistic regression to estimate prevalence and prevalence difference , adjusting for age and sex . This statistical approach corresponds to models in which conditional pre - dicted probabilities are calculated for each exposure level with every confounder ﬁ xedatitsmeanvalue . Mixed - effectPoissonregressionwith robust variance , based on the sandwich estimator 36 , was used to esti - mate prevalence ratio 37 and correct for potential dependence between participants as some children were siblings . Participants with missing data in at least one of the covariates ( n = 9 , 1 % ) were excluded from the models . Statistical signi ﬁ cance was de ﬁ ned as a level of con ﬁ dence of 95 % and all analyses were performed with R ( version 4 . 0 . 3 ) , using GLMMadaptive ( 0 . 8 - 5 ) , dplyr ( 1 . 0 . 10 ) , gtsummary ( 1 . 6 . 2 ) packages .
