We have recently shown that trans - forming growth factor ( TGF ) - b - induced EMT involves isoform switching of ﬁbroblast growth factor receptors by alternative splicing . We performed a microarray - based analysis at single exon level to elucidate changes in splicing variants generated during TGF - b - induced EMT , and found that TGF - b induces broad alteration of splicing patterns by downregulating epithelial splicing regulatory proteins ( ESRPs ) . This was achieved by TGF - b - mediated upregulation of d EF1 family proteins , d EF1 and SIP1 . d EF1 and SIP1 each remarkably repressed ESRP2 transcription through binding to the ESRP2 promoter in NMuMG cells . Silencing of both d EF1 and SIP1 , but not either alone , abolished the TGF - b - induced ESRP repres - sion . The expression proﬁles of ESRPs were inversely related to those of d EF1 and SIP in human breast cancer cell lines and primary tumor specimens . Further , over - expression of ESRPs in TGF - b - treated cells resulted in restoration of the epithelial splicing proﬁles as well as attenuation of certain phenotypes of EMT . Therefore , d EF1 family proteins repress the expression of ESRPs to regulate alternative splicing during TGF - b - induced EMT and the progression of breast cancers .

Recent works suggest that more than 90 % of human genes can produce different isoforms through alternative splicing ( Pan et al . , 2008 ; Wang et al . , 2008 ) . This process is tightly regulated in a tissue - and cell - type - dependent fashion ( Matlin et al . , 2005 ; Blencowe , 2006 ) , and alterations in this process are often linked to various types of diseases including cancer ( Wang and Cooper , 2007 ; Dutertre et al . , 2010 ) . Aberrations of splicing machinery result from mutations in splicing sites or dysfunction of splicing regulatory factors ( Licatalosi and Darnell , 2010 ) . One of the well - known genes that are regulated by tissue - speciﬁc alternative splicing is the ﬁbroblast growth factor receptors ( FGFRs ) . Functional FGFRs are encoded by four genes ( FGFR1 – FGFR4 ) , and the receptors consist of three extracellular immunoglobulin domains ( Ig - I , Ig - II and Ig - III ) , a single transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain ( Eswarakumar et al . , 2005 ) . FGFRs have several isoforms , as exon skipping removes the Ig - I domain . In addition , alternative splicing in the second half of the Ig - III domain in FGFR1 - FGFR3 produces the IIIb ( FGFR1IIIb - FGFR3IIIb ) and IIIc ( FGFR1IIIc - FGFR3IIIc ) isoforms that have distinct ﬁbroblast growth factor ( FGF ) - binding speciﬁcities and are predominantly expressed in epithelial and mesenchymal cells , respectively . FGF - 2 ( basic FGF ) and FGF - 4 bind preferentially to the IIIc isoforms , whereas FGF - 7 ( keratinocyte growth factor ) and FGF - 10 bind exclu - sively to the IIIb isoforms ( Coumoul and Deng , 2003 ; Chaffer et al . , 2007 ) . Recently , epithelial splicing regulatory proteins ( ESRPs ) 1 and 2 were identiﬁed as coordinators of the epithelial cell - type - speciﬁc splicing program . ESRPs activate the splicing of exon IIIb and silence the splicing of exon IIIc of FGFR2 , leading to the expression of proteins with the epithelial patterns of alternative splicing ( Warzecha et al . , 2009a , b ) . Epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) is the dif - ferentiation switch directing polarized epithelial cells to trans - differentiate into mesenchymal cells ( Thiery et al . , 2009 ) . During the process of embryonic development , wound healing and reorganization in adult tissues , epithelial cells have been shown to lose their epithelial Received 6 April 2011 ; revised 25 July 2011 ; accepted 15 September 2011 ; published online 31 October 2011 Correspondence : Professor K Miyazono or Dr M Saitoh , Department of Molecular Pathology , Graduate School of Medicine , University of Tokyo , 7 - 3 - 1 Hongo , Bunkyo - ku , Tokyo 113 0033 , Japan .

Further , EMT is involved in the process of invasion of tumor cells which also includes the loss of cell – cell interaction ( Kalluri and Weinberg , 2009 ) . Thus far , in nearly all cases , EMT appears to be regulated by extracellular matrix components and soluble growth factors or cytokines ( Thiery and Sleeman , 2006 ) . Among these factors , transforming growth factor - b ( TGF - b ) is considered as the key mediator of EMT during physiological processes . It is frequently and abundantly expressed in various tumors and also induces EMT in cancer cells during cancer progression . Recent studies revealed that TGF - b transcriptionally regulates expres - sion of several transcription factors , including the zinc - ﬁnger factors Snail and Slug , the two - handed zinc - ﬁnger factors of d EF1 family proteins d EF1 and SIP1 , the helix - loop - helix factors Twist and E12 / E47 , and the high motility group protein family HMGA2 , which are involved in the induction of EMT particularly through the transcriptional repression of E - cadherin ( Moustakas and Heldin , 2007 ; Miyazono , 2009 ) . We have recently reported that TGF - b induces isoform switching of FGFRs from IIIb to IIIc by alternative splicing during EMT in NMuMG cells , which results in enhanced EMT with aggressive pheno - types through cooperative action of TGF - b and FGF - 2 ( Shirakihara et al . , 2011 ) . In the present study , we found that TGF - b regulates alternative splicing of numerous genes during EMT . The expression of d EF1 family proteins , d EF1 and SIP1 , is increased after TGF - b treatment and subsequently represses the expression of the alternative splicing factor ESRP . Overexpression of ESRP in TGF - b - treated cells inhibits the conversion of alternative splicing pattern of epithelial types into those of mesenchymal types , as well as downregulation of the expression of E - cadherin . Repression of ESRP by d EF1 family proteins is thus , a crucial process during EMT induced by TGF - b and in progression of breast cancers . Results Changes in splice variants during TGF - b - induced EMT We have recently found that TGF - b primes isoform switching of FGFRs by alternative splicing during TGF - b - induced EMT , thereby changing the sensitivities of cells from FGF - 7 to FGF - 2 ( Shirakihara et al . , 2011 ) . Reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction ( RT – PCR ) analysis of mouse mammary epithelial NMuMG cells revealed that , in addition to FGFRs , CD44 splicing proﬁle and the total level of CD44 mRNA were changed after treatment with TGF - b ( Figures 1a and b ) . There are multiple splice variants of the Mena gene ( a member of Enabled ( Ena ) / vasodilator - stimulated phosphoprotein family of proteins ) that are involved in cancer progres - sion ( Philippar et al . , 2008 ) . We found that TGF - b also caused changes in splicing of the exon 11a of the Mena gene ( Figure 1c ) . These ﬁndings suggest that alteration in splicing variants by TGF - b is not limited to FGFRs . We next analyzed the expression of more than one million exons in NMuMG cells using mouse exon 1 . 0 ST array and adapted ARH method to rank the splicing predictions across the different genes ( Figure 1d ) ( Rasche and Herwig , 2010 ) . We found that the expression of 3601 genes was altered at the exon level , which was classiﬁed by GO parameters ( Lee et al . , 2008 ) , suggesting that TGF - b induces a broad alteration in splicing patterns and generates a number of splicing variants during EMT in NMuMG cells ( Supplementary Figure S1 and Supplementary Table 1 ) . As CD44 , FGFRs , SLK ( ste 20 - like kinase ) and CTNND1 ( also known as d - catenin or p120 catenin ) , of which splicing proﬁles have been reported to be regulated by ESRPs , were included in our exon - array data ( Figure 1e and Supplementary Figure S2 ) , we calculated ARH scores for the published exon - array data of ESRPs - silenced human prostate cancer PNT2 cells and compared the data with our exon - array data ( Warzecha et al . , 2009b ) . We found that 227 genes and 75 genes in ESRP1 / 2 - silenced cells overlapped with those of our data with P o 0 . 05 and P o 0 . 01 , respectively ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . These ﬁndings suggest that TGF - b - induced changes in splice variants are partly mediated by ESRPs . Repression of ESRPs by TGF - b We next determined how TGF - b regulates the functions of splicing factors ESRP1 and ESRP2 during EMT . We found that TGF - b considerably downregulated the mRNA expression of ESRP2 in NMuMG cells , whereas the expression of ESRP1 mRNA could not be clearly detected ( Figure 2a , left ) . We also examined the expression of ESRPs after TGF - b stimulation in other cells derived from mammary gland epithelial cells , including EpH4 cells expressing the viral H - Ras oncogene ( EpRas cells ) and breast cancer JygMC ( A ) cells ( Ehata et al . , 2007 ) . Treatment of EpRas cells with TGF - b repressed both ESRP1 and ESRP2 at the mRNA levels and ESRP1 at the protein level ( Figures 2a , right and b ) . As JygMC ( A ) cells autonomously secrete TGF - b ( Hoshino et al . , 2011 ) , we treated the cells with TGF - b type I receptor ( T b R - I ) inhibitor , SB431542 . The treatment increased the expression of ESRP1 and ESRP2 ( Figure 2c ) . In addition , transfec - tion of NMuMG cells with small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) against Smad2 and Smad3 attenuated the effects of TGF - b on the expression of ESRP2 ( Figure 2d ) . Moreover , when de novo protein synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide , which is an inhibitor of protein synthesis , downregulation of ESRP2 by TGF - b was attenuated ( Figure 2e ) . PAI - 1 and SIP1 have been reported as direct and indirect transcriptional targets of TGF - b / Smad pathway , respectively ( Shirakihara et al . , 2007 ) . Thus , these ﬁndings suggest that the suppression of ESRP2 by TGF - b involves de novo protein synthesis through the Smad pathway . ESRP2 repression by d EF1 and SIP1 in TGF - b - induced EMT We examined the expression proﬁles of d EF1 , SIP1 , E - cadherin and ESRP2 after TGF - b stimulation by quantitative RT – PCR . The levels of ESRP2 were TGF - b drives EMT through ESRP downregulation K Horiguchi et al 3191 Oncogene gradually decreased until 24 h upon TGF - b stimulation , with the expression proﬁle similar to that of E - cadherin and reciprocal to that of d EF1 and SIP1 ( Figure 3a ) . To evaluate the mechanism of reciprocal regulation between d EF1 / SIP1 and ESRP2 expression , we prepared the ESRP2 promoter region from NMuMG cells by a PCR - based strategy . The activity of ESRP2 promoter in NMuMG cells was remarkably repressed by constitu - tively active mutant of T b R - I ( caT b R - I ) , d EF1 and SIP1 . d EF1 overexpression had a stronger effect than SIP1 overexpression , probably because the protein levels of transfected SIP1 were much lower than those of d EF1 as determined by immunoblot analysis ( Figure 3b and Supplementary Figure S3a ) . When we infected the cells with adenoviral vector encoding either d EF1 or SIP1 , d EF1 or SIP1 each reduced the expression of endogenous ESRP2 mRNA with equivalent efﬁciencies ( Figure 3c ) . To determine whether d EF1 and SIP1 interact with the promoter regions of ESRP2 , we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) assays in NMuMG cells after TGF - b treatment . The quality of commercially available anti - d EF1 antibody was appropriate for ChIP assays , whereas that of anti - SIP1 antibodies was not suitable for this assay . Thus , we overexpressed FLAG - tagged SIP1 in NMuMG cells and immunoprecipitated it with anti - FLAG antibody . In the absence of TGF - b , the level of d EF1 expression was very low and thus insufﬁcient for ChIP ( Figure 3d ) . After treatment with TGF - b , interactions of d EF1 with DNA fragments of the ESRP2 promoter in NMuMG and EpRas cells ( Figure 3d , left and data not shown ) and the ESRP1 promoter in EpRas cells ( Figure 3d , right ) were observed . Moreover , SIP1 also interacted with the ESRP2 and ESRP1 promoters , whereas neither d EF1 nor SIP1 associated with hemoglobin b gene ( HBB ) promoter that was used as a negative control ( Figure 3d ) . In the competition assays of ChIP , overexpression of FLAG - SIP1 reduced the interaction of endogenous d EF1 Mouse Exon 1 . 0ST Array Prepare RNA ARH Analysis : Rank probe sets by ARH values NMuMG cells v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v6 v7 v8v9v10 CD44 GAPDH CD44 11a Mena 0 0 . 8 1 . 4 1 . 2 ( - ) 1 0 . 4 0 . 6 R e l a t i v e e x p r e ss i on ( A r b i t r a r y un i t s ) CD44 0 . 2 v1 v10 v9 v8 v7 v6 v5 v4 v3 v2 0 0 . 4 0 . 8 1 0 . 6 0 . 2 1 . 2 1 . 8 1 . 6 1 . 4 CD44 H 2 O ( - ) TGF - β TGF - β Mena Mena 11a + Mena 11a - GAPDH H 2 O ( - ) TGF - β TGF - β T G F - β ( + ) / T G F - β ( - ) p r obe s i gna l v a l ue s Figure 1 Changes in alternative splicing during TGF - b - induced EMT .

The ARH method was adapted to identify candidate genes at the exon level whose expressions changed during EMT . ( e ) The ratio of expression changes of each exon calculated by probe signal value in CD44 is shown . Red circles indicate the exons whose probe signals were altered by TGF - b treatment and reported to be spliced by ESRPs ( Warzecha et al . , 2009a ) . TGF - b drives EMT through ESRP downregulation K Horiguchi et al 3192 Oncogene with the ESRP2 promoter ( Supplementary Figure S3b ) , suggesting that d EF1 family proteins recognize the same binding regions of ESRP2 promoter . Overall , these ﬁndings indicate that d EF1 and SIP1 are preferentially recruited to the promoter region of ESRPs , and that they suppress the transcription of ESRPs in response to TGF - b treatment . As double knockdown of d EF1 and SIP1 is necessary to block the E - cadherin repression by TGF - b ( Shiraki - hara et al . , 2007 ) , we next analyzed the TGF - b - mediated ESRP2 repression in NMuMG cells in which both d EF1 and SIP1 were silenced using their speciﬁc siRNAs ( Figure 3e ) . TGF - b treatment induced the expression of d EF1 and SIP1 mRNAs by about three - fold after 48 h and repressed the expression of ESRP2 . In the cells transfected with either d EF1 or SIP1 siRNA alone , TGF - b - mediated ESRP2 repression was only partially blocked ; however , transfection with both d EF1 and SIP1 siRNAs completely abolished the TGF - b - mediated ESRP2 repression ( Figure 3e ) . The d EF1 / SIP1 - mediated ESRP repression was also detected in EpRas cells ( Supplementary Figure S3c ) . Therefore , similar to the repression of E - cadherin , the transcription of ESRPs is accumulatively regulated by the d EF1 family proteins during EMT by TGF - b . Switching between FGFR isoforms by ESRPs during TGF - b - induced EMT As we have previously reported ( Shirakihara et al . , 2011 ) , FGFR1 upregulated by TGF - b in NMuMG cells was the mesenchymal isoform , that is , FGFR1IIIc , α - tubulin ESRP1 EpRas cells 0 0 . 4 0 . 8 1 1 . 2 0 . 6 0 . 2 1 . 4 n . d . n . d .

TGF - b drives EMT through ESRP downregulation K Horiguchi et al 3193 Oncogene whereas the FGFR2 downregulated by TGF - b was the epithelial isoform , that is , FGFR2IIIb ( Figure 4a ) . Further , isoform switching of FGFR1 and FGFR2 was also observed in EpRas cells , in which both ESRP1 and ESRP2 were endogenously expressed ( Figures 2a and 4b ) . Because TGF - b downregulated the total levels of FGFR2 , the TGF - b - mediated induction of the IIIc isoform of FGFR2 was not clearly detected in both cells ( Figures 4a and b ) . When ESRP2 was silenced by its speciﬁc siRNAs in NMuMG cells , ESRP2 siRNA changed the FGFR2IIIb isoform to FGFR2IIIc isoform without appearance of FGFR1IIIc in the absence of TGF - b ( Figure 4c ) , suggesting that the TGF - b - mediated conversion of FGFR2IIIb into FGFR1IIIc requires ESRPs as well as other unidentiﬁed transcriptional factor ( s ) . In addition , transfection with both ESRP1 and ESRP2 siRNAs in EpRas cells resulted in the expression of IIIc isoform of FGFR2 as well as that of FGFR1 ( Figure 4d ) . Taken together , these ﬁndings suggest that TGF - b increases FGFR1 expression and decreases FGFR2 expression , leading to the conversion of the IIIb isoform into the IIIc isoform of FGFRs through alternative splicing by ESRPs . We next performed gain - of - function experiments after achieving ectopic expression of FLAG - tagged ESRP2 .

NC , control siRNA TGF - b drives EMT through ESRP downregulation K Horiguchi et al 3195 Oncogene de - repression of the ESRP2 ( Figure 4f ) . Switching of responses to FGF ligands was also conﬁrmed by phosphorylation of Erk in NMuMG cells ( Supplemen - tary Figures S4a – f ) . These ﬁndings , thus , suggest that isoform switching of functional FGFRs through TGF - b - induced alternative splicing is mediated by d EF1 / SIP1 - repressed ESRPs . Regulation of ESRP expression by d EF1 and SIP1 in human breast cancer cells TGF - b - induced EMT appears to correlate with the progression of various cancers , especially breast cancer ( Padua and Massague , 2009 ) . We examined the expres - sion of ESRPs and d EF1 / SIP1 as well as that of other EMT regulators , including Snail , Twist and Slug , in 23 human breast cancer cell lines . As previously reported , the expression of ESRPs was correlated with E - cadherin expression ( Supplementary Figure S5 ) ( Warzecha et al . , 2009a , b ) . Interestingly , the expression levels of d EF1 and SIP1 mRNAs in these cell lines were inversely correlated to those of ESRPs ( Figure 5a ) . However , the expression levels of neither Snail , Slug nor Twist were signiﬁcantly correlated with those of ESRPs in human breast cancer cells used in our study ( Supplementary Figure S5 ) . Importantly , most of the cell lines with high levels of d EF1 and SIP1 expression and low levels of ESRPs expression appeared to be categorized into the ‘basal - like’ subtype of breast cancer ( Charafe - Jauffret et al . , 2006 ; Neve et al . , 2006 ; Yamaguchi et al . , 2008 ) . In contrast , most of the cell lines with low levels of d EF1 and SIP1 expression and high levels of ESRPs expres - sion were categorized into the ‘luminal’ subtype of breast cancer . Among the 23 cell lines , we selected several cell lines and conﬁrmed the expression of FGFR isoforms by RT – PCR . CRL1500 and UACC893 cells , which expressed low d EF1 / SIP1 levels and high ESRP1 / 2 levels , exhibited constitutive expression of only IIIb isoforms of FGFR ( Figure 5b ) . On the other hand , MDA - MB - 231 , MDA - MB - 157 , Hs578T , HCC1395 and BT549 cells , with low expression of ESRPs and high expression of d EF1 / SIP1 , expressed only IIIc isoforms of FGFRs ( Figure 5b ) . Moreover , double knockdown of d EF1 and SIP1 increased the expression of ESRP1 and ESRP2 in MDA - MB231 and BT549 cells ( Figure 5c ) , indicating that d EF1 and SIP1 down - regulate ESRP expression in human breast cancer cells . We next examined whether d EF1 / SIP1 and ESRPs are reciprocally expressed in human breast tumors . Primary tumor tissues from cancer patients were subjected to immunohistochemical analyses with anti - d EF1 and anti - ESRP1 antibodies . The quality of anti - ESRP2 antibodies obtained in our study was not suitable for immunohistochemical analyses . The samples analyzed showed positive ESRP1 and cytokeratin 19 ( K19 ) staining in cancer cells in tumor nest , whereas d EF1 was not detected in typical tumor cells , especially those in the tumor nest , but it was clearly detected in stromal cells and spindle - shaped cells at the degenerated tumor nests ( Figure 5d ) . Therefore , these ﬁndings suggest that the expression levels of ESRP and d EF1 are reciprocally controlled in tumor tissues and / or stroma tissues , which was consistent with the expression proﬁles in breast cancer cell lines . ESRPs attenuate malignant phenotypes of cancer cells as well as EMT MDA - MB - 231 cells are morphologically classiﬁed as poorly differentiated carcinoma cells ( Neve et al . , 2006 ) . We analyzed the anchorage - independent growth of MDA - MB - 231 cells by cultivating the cells in soft agar . As shown in Figure 6a , these cells showed anchorage - independent growth , whereas the cells overexpressing ESRPs failed to efﬁciently proliferate in soft agar . Overexpression of ESRPs also switched the isoform expression of FGFR1 from IIIc to IIIb in MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Supplementary Figure S6a ) . The expression of E - cadherin was upregulated at the mRNA and protein levels in cells overexpressing ESRPs ( Figures 6b , d and e ) , whereas reorganization of actin stress ﬁber and expressions of EMT regulators and mesenchymal marker proteins , including ﬁbronectin and N - cadherin , were not signiﬁcantly affected by ESRP overexpres - sion ( Figure 6e , Supplementary Figures S6b and c ) . In addition , morphology of the cells overexpressing ESRPs was altered to a cobblestone - like shape ( Figure 6c ) , suggesting that ESRPs partially restored the well - differentiated phenotype in cells with a poorly differ - entiated phenotype . Moreover , these effects of ESRPs were also conﬁrmed in NMuMG cells , in which the overexpression of ESRP2 restored TGF - b - mediated alteration of morphology and downregulation of E - cadherin ( Figures 6f , g and h ) . Similar to MDA - MB - 231 cells , ESRP overexpression failed to affect the expression of mesenchymal marker proteins and reorganization of actin stress ﬁber ( Supplementary Figures S6d and e ) . These ﬁndings thus suggest that ESRPs attenuate the EMT phenotype mainly through upregulation of E - cadherin . Figure 5 Expression proﬁles of ESRP1 / 2 and d EF1 / SIP1 in breast cancer cells .

Recently , proﬁling of ESRP - regulated splicing using a further sensitive analysis was reported ( Warzecha et al . , 2010 ) . In the report , Affymetrix human exon junction arrays were performed to proﬁle splicing changes in response to ectopic expression of ESRP1 in MDA - MB - 231 cells and knockdown of ESRP1 and ESRP2 in PNT2 cells . They identiﬁed 310 genes in MDA - MB - 231 cells and 385 genes in PNT2 cells as ESRP - dependent targets of alternative splicing . When they were compared with our gene list of NMuMG cells ( P o 0 . 01 ) , 55 genes in MDA - MB - 231 cells and 92 genes in PNT2 cells matched our GFP ESRP1 + ESRP2 0 0 . 15 0 . 25 0 . 3 GFP ESRP1 + 2 MDA - MB - 231 0 . 2 0 . 05 0 . 1 O D 450 E - cadherin FLAG TOTO3 merge 0 GFP ESRP1 + 2 0 . 002 0 . 016 0 . 018 E - cadherin 0 . 006 R e l a t i v e e x p r e ss i on ( A r b i t r a r y un i t s ) 0 . 014 0 . 012 0 . 010 0 . 008 0 . 004 α - tubulin E - cadherin FLAG 0 0 . 5 1 . 5 1 E - c adhe r i n / α - t ubu li n GFP IF ( - ) ( - ) FLAG - ESRP2 ( - ) ( - ) T G F - β GFP IF ( - ) FLAG - ESRP2 ( - ) T G F - β ( - ) T G F - β ( - ) T G F - β ( - ) TGF - β GFP FLAG - ESRP2 ( - ) TGF - β GFP FLAG - ESRP2 GFP ESRP1 + 2 α - tubulin E - cadherin GFP ESRP1 + 2 N - cadherin fibronectin GFP ESRP1 + 2 T G F - β T G F - β Figure 6 ESRPs attenuate malignant phenotypes of cancer cells .

TGF - b drives EMT through ESRP downregulation K Horiguchi et al 3198 Oncogene gene list of NMuMG cells . Although it is difﬁcult to further evaluate these data , due to the differences in species and tissues of the cells lines , these ﬁndings suggest that ESRPs play crucial roles in alteration in splicing variants during TGF - b - induced EMT . Regulation of FGFRs by TGF - b at the levels of transcription and alternative splicing Splicing of the second half of the third Ig - like domain of the FGFRs has been well documented ( Eswarakumar et al . , 2005 ) . ESRPs were identiﬁed through the screening of the proteins that regulate the splicing of FGFRs ( Warzecha et al . , 2009a , b ) . We have recently reported that TGF - b induces isoform switching of FGFRs from the IIIb to IIIc type by alternative splicing during EMT in NMuMG cells , which results in enhanced EMT through the cooperative action of TGF - b and FGF - 2 ( Shirakihara et al . , 2011 ) . NMuMG cells predominantly expressed FGFR2IIIb in the resting state . TGF - b repressed the expression of FGFR2IIIb isoform and induced the expression of the FGFR1IIIc isoform , but not that of the FGFR2IIIc ( Figure 4a ) . Importantly , overexpression of ESRP2 in TGF - b - treated NMuMG cells led to an increase in FGFR1IIIb isoform ( Figure 4e ) , and d EF1 and SIP1 siRNAs did not affect the upregulation of FGFR1 ( Figure 4f ) . These ﬁndings suggest that d EF1 and SIP1 are dispensable in the TGF - b - mediated transcriptional regula - tion of FGFR1 . Therefore , isoform switching of FGFRs during TGF - b - induced EMT requires ESRPs and other unidentiﬁed transcriptional factor ( s ) that are not regulated by d EF1 / SIP1 . Splicing proﬁles of CD44 and Mena were also changed by ESRP2 siRNA ( Supplementary Figures S7a and b ) . As described above , treatment by TGF - b alone induced partial EMT with about 50 % reduction of ESRP2 mRNA ( Figure 2a ) . Thus , addition of FGF - 2 in TGF - b - treated cells further repressed the levels of ESRP2 mRNA and in turn changed the proﬁle of alternative splicing of Mena ( Supplementary Figure S7c ) . When ESRP2 was knocked down in TGF - b - treated cells , Mena was almost completely altered to its splicing variant ( Mena 11a - ) ( Supplementary Figure S7d ) . These ﬁndings , therefore , suggest that TGF - b stimulation elicits partial EMT with repression of ESRP2 to about 50 % , and that further reduction of ESRP2 expression induces enhanced EMT with aggressive phenotypes of mesenchyme . Attenuation of EMT phenotype by ESRPs Human breast cancer MDA - MB - 231 cells are classiﬁed as poorly differentiated carcinoma cells , and express low levels of ESRP1 / 2 and high levels of d EF1 / SIP1 . Over - expression of ESRPs upregulated E - cadherin expres - sion without affecting the levels of d EF1 and SIP1 ( Figures 6b – e , and Supplementary Figure S6c ) . Among other EMT regulators , expression of Snail and Slug was not affected by ESRPs , whereas that of E47 and Twist was not detected in the cells ( Supplementary Figure S6c and data not shown ) , suggesting that restoration of E - cadherin by ESRPs is not induced by de - repression of the EMT regulators . In addition , ESRP2 overexpression failed to downregulate mesenchymal - marker proteins and restore reorganization of actin stress ﬁber in MDA - MB - 231 and TGF - b - treated NMuMG cells ( Figures 6e , Supplementary Figures S6b , d and e ) . In the present study , some of polarity and adhesion proteins , including p120 catenin and scribbled , are regulated at splicing levels by ESRPs . Thus , alternative splicing variants of these proteins may regulate unidentiﬁed E - cadherin inducers or epithelial regulators , and alter the cells from mesenchymal to epithelial phenotype through increase in E - cadherin expression . Regulation of ESRP expression in other types of cancer d EF1 and SIP1 are necessary for TGF - b - induced EMT in NMuMG cells and in some breast cancer cells ( Shiraki - hara et al . , 2007 ; Gregory et al . , 2008 ) . Intriguingly , they were not upregulated by TGF - b and dispensable for TGF - b - induced EMT in pancreatic cancer Panc - 1 cells , in which Snail was involved in TGF - b - induced EMT ( Horiguchi et al . , 2009 ) . Moreover , Twist induced EMT in human mammary epithelial HMLE cells ( Yang et al . , 2004 ) . Thus , expression of each EMT regulator appears to be variously regulated in the cells that have undergone EMT , depend - ing on cell or tissue speciﬁcity . EMT regulators are not good markers to detect cells that have undergone EMT , because in certain cells it is difﬁcult to determine which regulators speciﬁcally and preferentially contribute to EMT . However , ESRPs were repressed by Snail and Twist in certain cells that had undergone EMT , including Panc - 1 cells ( Supplementary Figure S8 ) and HMLE cells ( Warzecha et al . , 2009a , b ) , respectively , and the expres - sion of ESRPs was inversely correlated with progression of breast cancer ( Figure 5a ) . Therefore , these ﬁndings suggest that ESRPs , rather than EMT regulators , may be useful negative markers for detecting cells that have undergone EMT or cancer cells with more aggressive phenotypes . Expression of d EF1 / SIP1 and ESRPs in the ‘basal - like’ and ‘luminal’ types of breast cancer cells Our ﬁndings on a panel of 23 human breast cancer cell lines revealed an important phenomenon that the expression levels of ESRPs are reciprocally controlled by the expression levels of d EF1 family proteins . Importantly , most of the cell lines with high levels of d EF1 and SIP1 expression and low levels of ESRP expression were categorized into the ‘basal - like’ subtype of breast cancer ( Charafe - Jauffret et al . , 2006 ; Neve et al . , 2006 ; Yamaguchi et al . , 2008 ) . Thus , elevated expression of d EF1 and SIP1 appears to correlate with aggressive phenotypes and poor prognosis of cancer patients , which are most likely due to the reinforced invasive and metastatic properties of tumor cells via EMT . In contrast , most of the cell lines with low levels of d EF1 and SIP1 expression and high levels of ESRPs expression were categorized into the ‘luminal’ subtype of breast cancer . Thus , d EF1 and SIP1 are speciﬁcally expressed in ‘basal - like’ subtype and ESRPs are speciﬁcally expressed in ‘luminal’ subtype of breast cancer cells . Although some of the luminal - type breast cancer cells expressed high levels of Snail or Twist TGF - b drives EMT through ESRP downregulation K Horiguchi et al 3199 Oncogene mRNAs , it is still unknown why these EMT regulators failed to affect E - cadherin expression . In addition to mRNA proﬁling , determination of the protein levels of the EMT regulators will be required in the future . Materials and methods Cell culture , reagents and antibodies All cells used in the present study were cultured as described previously ( Shirakihara et al . , 2011 ) . Recombinant human TGF - b 1 was obtained from R & D Systems ( Minneapolis , MN , USA ) . SB431542 was form Sigma - Aldrich ( St Louis , MO , USA ) . Mouse monoclonal anti - FLAG M2 , anti - a - tubulin and anti - ESRP1 antibodies were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich . Rabbit monoclonal anti - keratin 19 and polyclonal d EF1 antibodies were purchased from Epitomics ( Burlingame , CA , USA ) and Novus Biologicals ( Littleton , CO , USA ) , respec - tively . Mouse anti - E - cadherin antibody was from BD Trans - duction Laboratories ( Lexington , KY , USA ) . RNA extraction , microarray and RT – PCR analyses Total RNA was puriﬁed using the RNeasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA , USA ) and used to perform microarray , conven - tional RT – PCR and quantitative RT – PCR analyses . Values were normalized to mouse TATA binding protein ( TBP ) or human hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 . The primer sequences are shown in Supplementary Table 3 . Oligonucleotide microarray analysis was performed using GeneChip Mouse Exon 1 . 0 ST Array ( Affymetrix ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The ARH method was used to identify exons differentially expressed between non - treated and TGF - b - treated NMuMG cells ( Rasche and Herwig , 2010 ) . Exon - array data are available at Gene Expression Omnibus ( GSE28184 ) . DNA construction and generation of lentiviruses Mouse ESRP2 promoter , containing (cid:2) 1000 to þ 200 base pairs from transcription start site , was cloned by PCR using genomic DNA of NMuMG cells . The puriﬁed PCR fragment was cloned into pGL4 vector ( Promega , Madison , WI , USA ) . Human ESRP1 and mouse ESRP2 were cloned by PCR using cDNA of A431 and NMuMG cells . All constructs were conﬁrmed by sequencing . The mouse d EF1 and SIP1 cDNAs , and the adenoviral vector encoding d EF1 or SIP1 epitope - tagged with FLAG at their N - termini were described previously ( Shirakihara et al . , 2007 ) . We used a lentiviral expression system to establish stable expression of ESRP2 in NMuMG cells ( NMuMG - ESRP2 ) and that of ESRP1 / 2 in MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Horiguchi et al . , 2009 ) . RNA interference Transfection of siRNA was performed according to the protocol recommended for HiPerfect ( Qiagen ) or RNAiMAX ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . NMuMG cells were transiently transfected with siRNAs against mouse d EF1 ( Stealth RNAi MSS210696 ; Invitrogen ) , mouse SIP1 ( Stealth RNAi MSS216412 ; Invitrogen ) , mouse ESRP1 ( Stealth RNAi MSS209488 ; Invitrogen ) , or mouse ESRP2 ( Stealth RNAi MSS246490 ; Invitrogen ) . Human breast cancer cells were transiently transfected with siRNAs against human d EF1 ( Stealth RNAi HSS110549 ; Invitrogen ) and human SIP1 ( Stealth RNAi HSS114854 ; Invitrogen ) . The ﬁnal concentra - tion of the siRNAs used was 20 n M . At 12h after transfection , 1ng / ml TGF - b was added and cultured for an additional 48h . Immunoblotting , luciferase assays , ChIP and immunohistochemistry analyses of tumor sample The procedures used for immunoblotting , immunoﬂuores - cence , luciferase assays and ChIP were as previously described ( Horiguchi et al . , 2009 ; Koinuma et al . , 2009 ) . Formalin - ﬁxed , parafﬁn - embedded primary breast tumor tissues were obtained as a part of routine clinical management of patients with breast cancer at the Hospital of University of Yamanashi . Hematox - ylin and eosin - stained sections were examined for regions that contained tumor cells and stroma , which were then analyzed as serial sections for anti - d EF1 , ESRP1 and K19 antibodies . All studies were conducted using the protocol approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Yamanashi . Colony - formation assay in soft agar Agar ( Nacalai Tesque , Kyoto , Japan ) was dissolved with culture medium to a ﬁnal concentration of 0 . 5 % in six - well plates . Cells were seeded at a density of 3 (cid:3) 10 4 cells per well in 0 . 3 % agar . The cells were covered with culture media for 3 weeks . Cell viability was measured using Cell Count Reagent SF ( Nacalai Tesque ) . The reagent was added in the media and incubated for 60min . The aliquot was taken and color - imetrically measured at 450 – 650nm wavelengths . Conﬂict of interest The authors declare no conﬂict of interest .
