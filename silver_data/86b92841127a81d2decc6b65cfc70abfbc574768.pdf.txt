IJO classically presents in early pubertal period with multiple fractures including metaphyseal and vertebral crush fractures , and low bone - mass . Methods : Here we describe two patients and provide information on their clinical phenotype , genotype and bone material analysis in one of the patients . Results : Patient 1 : 40 - year old adult male diagnosed with IJO in childhood who re - presented with a hip fracture as an adult . Genetic analysis identified a pathogenic PLS3 hemizygous variant , c . 1765del in exon 16 . Patient 2 : 15 - year old boy with multiple vertebral fractures and bone biopsy findings suggestive of IJO who also has a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder . Genetic analysis identified a maternally inherited PLS3 pathogenic c . 1295T > A variant in exon 12 . Analyses of the transiliac bone sample revealed severe reduction of trabecular volume and bone turnover indices and elevated bone matrix mineralisation . Discussion : We propose that genetic testing for PLS3 should be undertaken in patients presenting with a current or previous history of IJO as this has implications for genetic counselling and cas - cade screening . The extensive evaluation of the transiliac biopsy sample of Patient 2 revealed a novel bone phenotype . Conclusion : This report includes a review of IJO and genetic causes of osteoporosis , and suggests that existing cases of IJO should be screened for PLS3 . Through analysis of bone material proper - ties in Patient 2 , we can conclude that PLS3 does have a role in bone mineralisation . KEYWORDS X - linked osteoporosis , idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis , bone biopsy , bone material properties , PLS3 , fractures 1 | INTRODUCTION Idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis ( IJO ) is the descriptive term used to define primary osteoporosis of unknown etiology presenting in child - hood . It is usually associated with vertebral and metaphyseal fractures in the years leading to puberty . It has been previously reported to not be associated with heritable genetic variants and usually diagnosed by a process of elimination through exclusion of other causes of decreased bone density ( Rauch et al . , 2000 ) . The classic pathophysiology of IJO involves a dysfunction in cancellous bone formation in two ways : fewer 1578 | V C 2018 Wiley Periodicals , Inc . wileyonlinelibrary . com / journal / ajmga Am J Med Genet . 2018 ; 176A : 1578 – 1586 . Received : 10 January 2018 | Revised : 26 February 2018 | Accepted : 6 April 2018 DOI : 10 . 1002 / ajmg . a . 38830 remodeling cycles and reduction in quantity of bone formed in each of these cycles . This leads to thin trabeculae by the time of maturity ( Rauch et al . , 2000 ) . Hartikka et al . ( 2005 ) reported heterozygous variants in LRP5 in a small number of children with IJO more than a decade ago . Genetic causes of osteoporosis have now been increasingly identified due to advances in genetic screening , with variants in genes with dominant , recessive and X - linked recessive inheritance patterns ( Biha et al . , 2016 ; Fahiminiya et al . , 2014 ; Kampe et al . , 2015 ; Rocha - Braz and Ferraz - de - Souza , 2016 ) . PLS3 ( OMIM 300131 ) has 16 exons and is located on Xq23 , it encodes a highly conserved plastin 3 that binds actin and shown to have an effect on bone mineral density . Plastin 3 is ubiquitously expressed in solid tissues and involved in the binding and bundling of actin filaments in the cytoskeleton . Variants in PLS3 lead to significantly reduced bone mineral density ( Laarschot et al . , 2016 ; Laine et al . , 2015 ; McGovern et al . , 2015 ) . Although , the exact function of PLS3 in bone is still unknown , suggested roles of Plastin 3 includes the processes of mechanosensing , converting applied mechanical loading forces into molecular signals that are interpreted by the cells . More recently , it has been suggested to have a role in the mineralization process . Being located on the X chromosome , PLS3 - induced osteoporosis has a more severe effect on males than females , although heterozygous carrier females are also known have early - onset osteoporosis . Here , we report two patients initially diagnosed clinically as IJO in whom PLS3 pathogenic variants were identified . Although there have been several large pedigrees reported with plastin - induced osteoporo - sis in the literature , bone material properties have not been extensively studied and results have been varied . In the current report , we demon - strate this variability further and attempt genotype – phenotype correla - tion in order to untangle the results on detailed bone material analyses . 2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS 2 . 1 | Clinical report Patient 1 : The first patient is a 40 - year - old Caucasian male who initially presented to a Pediatric Metabolic Bone service outside of our center at the age of 12 years , with a history of musculoskeletal aches and pains and morning stiffness . On examination at that time , he was noted to be short in the trunk , and showed difficulty moving from a position of forward flexion to an upright position . X - rays were reported as showing generalized osteope - nia with compression of almost all lower thoracic and lumbar vertebrae , consistent with a clinical diagnosis of “ Osteoporosis ” or “ Osteogenesis Imperfecta . ” He had an elevated alkaline phosphatase , but no other abnormality was noted on investigation . He was given a diagnosis of IJO at age 13 . He was instructed to wear a supportive back brace but received no specific therapy . It is of note that his mother , then in her 40s , had already been diagnosed with osteoporosis ( Figure 1a ) . He was subsequently lost to follow - up . Aged 38 , this patient was referred to the adult metabolic bone service , following a fracture of his hip , which occurred during an accident at work . Additionally , he gave a history of a traumatic foot fracture . On examination , he had white sclerae , was not facially dys - morphic with no other features suggestive of OI or other metabolic bone disease . During diagnostic work - up , he was noted to have multi - ple vertebral fractures and recalled the history of IJO . Investigations did not identify any other contributory causes . His bone density was below the expected range for age ; lumbar spine T - score was 2 4 . 8 ( although the presence of vertebral fractures affects the reliability of the result ) , Z - score was 2 4 . 8 , total hip T - score was 2 3 . 5 with a Z - score of 2 3 . 6 . Spinal imaging demonstrated fractures of all lumbar vertebrae and most of the thoracic vertebrae ( with the exception of T3 ) ( Figure 1b and c ) . He was prescribed Alendronate , supplementary calcium and vitamin D . This patient was referred to Genetics , aged 39 . A detailed family pedigree was taken which confirmed that his mother , now in her 70s , had been diagnosed with osteoporosis at an early age . More recently , after long - term bisphosphonate treatment , she had sustained bilateral atypical femoral fractures ( two years apart ) . He has two teenage sons who have had no concerns regarding their bone health . He had targeted gene testing for LRP5 and PLS3 . His family history was then expanded from his mother ’ s osteopo - rosis to include the osteoporosis of his maternal uncle . His sister had sustained no fractures . Although family studies have been requested , no samples have been forthcoming . Patient 2 : The second patient is a 15 - year - old boy referred to the Metabolic Bone service with a history of recurrent fractures . He is the first child of healthy , non - consanguineous Caucasian parents with no significant family history apart from osteoporosis in maternal aunt and maternal grandmother . He has a younger sibling who is fit and well ( Figure 2a ) . His initial fracture aged 2 was of his left forearm following minor trauma , then aged 6 of his right forearm and wrist . Aged 12 years , when he was first seen in the Metabolic Bone clinic , his back was noted to be straight but his spine imaging showed multiple vertebral crush fractures in both the lumbar and thoracic spine affecting seven vertebrae altogether ( Figure 2b ) . Both his lumbar spine and total body less head BMD ( Bone mineral density ) were below the normal range for age with aBMD ( arealBMD ) Z - scores of 2 2 . 7 and 2 2 . 6 , respec - tively . Bone biopsy performed prior to starting treatment with bisphosphonates showed features detailed below including reduced osteoblast and osteoclast surfaces , trabecular loss and reduced connec - tivity , and cortical thinning . He was also noted to have elevated bone - specific alkaline phosphatase for age , which subsequently normalized , possibly reflecting recent fractures . He was commenced on treatment with three - monthly Pamidronate infusions at 1 mg / kg on three succes - sive days with good initial response . Eight months after starting treatment , his lateral vertebral analysis showed six vertebrae with reduced height ; his age - matched lumbar spine aBMD Z - score had risen from 2 2 . 7 prior to treatment to 2 1 . 4 and his total body less head aBMD Z - score rose from 2 2 . 6 to 2 1 . 7 . Further treatment for 2 . 5 years with Pamidronate followed , with a switch to Zoledronic acid thereafter . His lumbar spine aBMD continued to increase despite reducing the dose of treatment to 60 % of the BALASUBRAMANIAN ET AL . | 1579 regular dose . His aBMD rose to 1 1 . 3 and his current dual - energy X - ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) image shows significant vertebral endplate sclerosis with some improvement in the overall shape and height of the previously crush - fractured vertebrae ( Figure 2c ) . He was referred to the Genetics clinic in view of his bone fragility and a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) . A detailed family pedigree was taken which confirmed that his mother had sustained a fracture of her forearm but there was a more significant fracture his - tory in a maternal aunt who had been diagnosed with osteoporosis in her 30s . He was enrolled to a research study looking at the association of bone fragility and autism with appropriate consent and trio whole exome sequencing was undertaken . 2 . 2 | Bone histomorphometry and quantitative backscattered electron imaging A transiliac bone biopsy was obtained from Patient 2 before the initiation of bisphosphonate ( BP ) treatment , following double labeling with tetracy - cline to allow for dynamic measurement of bone formation . Sample prep - aration and histomorphometric analyses were performed using standard procedures ( Glorieux et al . , 2000 ) . Results were compared to reference data of healthy age - matched controls and children with OI type I ( Glorieux et al . , 2000 ; Rauch et al . , 2000 ) . Subsequently , the residual block was prepared to assess bone mineralization density distribution ( BMDD ) , reflecting the calcium content of cortical and trabecular bone matrix , by FIGURE 1 ( a – c ) Family pedigree of Patient 1 ; spinal imaging in Patient 1 at 38 years of age demonstrating vertebral fractures of all lumbar vertebrae and most of the thoracic vertebrae ( with the exception of T3 ) and residual deformities ; low BMD on DXA imaging [ Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary . com ] 1580 | BALASUBRAMANIAN ET AL . quantitative backscattered electron imaging ( qBEI ) as described elsewhere ( Roschger et al . , 2008 ) . The BMDD parameters values were compared to healthy controls and children with OI type I ( Fratzl - Zelman et al . , 2009 ; Fratzl - Zelman et al . , 2016 ; Roschger et al . , 2008 ) . 3 | RESULTS Patient 1 : Targeted genomic sequencing of exons 2 – 16 of PLS3 detected a hemizygous deletion , c . 1765del in exon 16 of PLS3 . This likely pathogenic variant was predicted to result in a p . Ala589fs change . The predicted result for this variant was a frameshift , leading to the creation of a premature termination codon 21 amino acids down - stream . This particular variant had not been reported on the LOVD database entry on PLS3 but other such frameshift variants in PLS3 have been reported in association with osteoporosis . Patient 2 : Targeted sequencing for genes associated with OI including autosomal dominant panel ( COL1A1 / A2 & IFITM5 ) and LRP5 testing were negative . Previous genetic testing also included normal 60 kb array com - parative genomic hybridization ( CGH ) in view of his diagnosis of ASD . This patient was then enrolled to a research study studying the association of autism and OI funded by Newlife Foundation . This study had been approved by the South Yorkshire Research Ethics Committee and appropriate institutional boards and the research has been per - formed in accordance with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration . Trio whole exome sequencing showed that he was hemizygous for the c . 1295T > A pathogenic variant in exon 12 of PLS3 . This variant was predicted to result in a p . Leu432 * change and although , not previously reported in the literature , similar variants in PLS3 have been reported in association with osteoporosis . Further testing showed that his mother carried the same PLS3 variant . The qualitative assessment of the bone biopsy sample obtained from the patient prior initiation of bisphosphonate therapy revealed very small and isolated trabecular features ; one very trabecularised cor - tex and one well - delineated cortical plate ( see Figure 3a ) . Under polar - ized light , cortical and trabecular bone showed an ordered lamellar pattern . In particular , the parallel lamellar organization of the cortical plates suggested that they were formed by primary bone apposition through processes of bone modeling and modeling drift ( Figure 3b ) . The bone histomorphometric analyses confirmed that the amount of trabecular ( bone volume per tissue volume ) was severely reduced com - pared to aged - matched controls and rather in the range of OI patients ( see Table 1 ) . However , in contrast to OI bone , all parameters of bone formation and bone resorption were also found to be very low . Com - pared to healthy control values , osteoid thickness , mineral apposition rate and the mineralizing surface were decreased . The percentage of trabecular surfaces covered either by osteoblasts or osteoclasts was reduced by about 80 % and 90 % , respectively ( Figure 3c ) . It should be noted that more osteoclasts and osteoblasts were viewed in the corti - cal areas ( not shown ) mirroring an active trabecularization process . The qBEI analyses revealed a hypermineralization of the bone matrix similar as in OI bone . In both the trabecular and cortical com - partment , the BMDD curve was shifted towards a higher mineral content compared to healthy controls ( Figure 3d , e ) . Consistently , the average calcium content of the matrix ( CaMean ) , the most frequently occurring calcium concentration ( CaPeak ) and the portion of highly mineralized bone ( CaHigh ) were elevated in both bone compartments , while the percentage of lowly mineralized matrix ( CaLow ) was mark - edly reduced ( see Table 2 ) . 4 | DISCUSSION Osteoporosis is a complicated diagnosis to make , due to the range of factors that can contribute to its pathogenesis . It is characterized by reduced bone mass and an increased predisposition for bone fractures . Current definition of childhood - onset primary osteoporosis requires a clinically significant fracture history and BMD Z - score at or below 2 2 . 0 ( Kämpe et al . , 2015 ) . A clinically significant fracture history can be defined as two or more long bone fractures aged 10 years or below and three or more long bone fractures aged 19 years or below .

Diagnostic workup should include exclusion of other co - morbidities such as celiac disease , inflammatory bowel disease , eating disorders , Vitamin D , and calcium deficiency . Current strategies for genetic testing for childhood - onset osteopo - rosis include targeted gene panels including genes that cause OI , LRP5 , WNT1 , and PLS3 . However , with costs of genetic testing coming down and more genes being discovered , whole exome / genome sequencing is likely to replace targeted gene panels as first - line testing in the near future . PLS3 ( OMIM number : 300131 ) is located on chromosome Xq23 . It contains 16 exons and spans 90 kb . It encodes plastin 3 protein , which is an actin binding protein found in intestinal microvilli , hair cell stereo - cilia , and fibroblast filopodia . Additionally , it seems to have a role in development of bone , an influence on growth of axons , and expressed in circulating cells in cases of colorectal cancer ( Laarschot et al . , 2016 ; Laine et al . , 2015 ; McGovern et al . , 2015 ) .

The bone regulatory actions of PLS3 are not fully known . It has been demonstrated that overexpression protects against spinal muscu - lar atrophy . It has also been observed in zebrafish that knockout pls3 fish develop craniofacial bone structure malformations , which was reversible using human PLS3 mRNA ( McGovern et al . , 2015 ) . Dijk et al . ( 2013 ) observed that the chicken homolog for PLS3 ( fimbrin ) is highly expressed in osteocyte dendrites responsible for mechanosensation ( Dijk et al . , 2013 ) . The authors propose loss of mechanosensation as a possible mechanism for the osteoporosis effects . Whilst the particular variants exhibited by both these patients in this study have not been published elsewhere , other frameshift variants in this gene have been found to cause X - linked osteoporosis . Maternal heterozygotes have been shown to be either unaffected or show early osteoporosis symptoms , as was the case with these patients ( OI variant database : Dalgleish , 2017 ) . Since its first description of PLS3 - osteoporosis in five families with apparent X - linked osteoporosis , there have been other case reports adding to the literature and expanding the phenotype of this condition ( Dijk et al . , 2013 ; Laarschot et al . , 2016 ; Kannu et al . , 2017 ; Lv et al . , 2017 ; Kämpe et al . , 2017 ) . From the literature so far and corroborated by our patients , the phenotype consists of vertebral compression frac - tures , peripheral including long bone fractures and low BMD but with - out features such as blue sclerae , short stature , joint hyperlaxity , or facial features typical of “ Classical OI ” which is helpful in terms of genotype - phenotype correlation . Therefore , in patients with predomi - nant history of vertebral fractures and / or low BMD without features of OI and family history suggestive of X - linked osteoporosis , PLS3 - osteoporosis remains the top differential diagnosis . It is also important to make this diagnosis as carrier females albeit more mildly affected than males must be screened and kept under appropriate follow - up . Patient 2 had features of ASD in addition to bone fragility and was recruited to a research study to explore this association further . Exome data have not identified any other variants of interest apart from the PLS3 variant which is X - linked . So far , PLS3 patients have been reported to have normal intellectual development . Interestingly , reports of PLS3 - osteoporosis patients include those pediatric patients labeled as having “ spastic cerebral palsy , ” “ waddling gait ” and there has been a suggestion that PLS3 is linked to spinal muscular atrophy ( SMA ) ( Hosseinibarkooie at al . , 2017 ) . It is therefore , important to assess neu - romuscular function and CNS assessment in further detail in these patients . Plastin 3 is said to be a protective modifier in SMA and reported to have a role in neuromuscular synapse maintenance which adds further weight to the suggestion that in addition to the role in bone mineralization , this plastin may also have a role in intellectual development . It remains to be seen whether he has an alternate diag - nosis to explain the ASD or the PLS3 variant is somehow contributing to his diagnosis of ASD . Further trio genome sequencing studies are ongoing to search for an alternate etiology .

BALASUBRAMANIAN ET AL . | 1583 The extensive evaluation of the transiliac biopsy sample of Patient 2 revealed a novel bone phenotype associated with PLS3 variant . Fahiminiya et al . ( 2014 ) first reported pediatric patients with normal bone formation and normal BMDD ( Fahiminiya et al . , 2014 ) . In a more recent study from Kämpe et al . ( 2017 ) , data from a PLS3 variant carrier were presented that showed increased osteoid formation and concomi - tant hypomineralization of the bone matrix ( Kämpe et al . , 2017 ) . In sharp contrast , Patient 2 of the present study had low bone turnover , low osteoid formation compared to healthy controls and very low val - ues compared to OI as shown in Table 1 . Indeed , children with OI tend to have elevated indices of bone formation and resorption that was definitively not observed in the present case ( Rauch et al . , 2000 ) . How - ever , this PLS3 patient shares with OI patients , the characteristic decreased trabecular bone volume and the abnormally high mineral content of the bone matrix as revealed by qBEI ( Table 2 ) ( Rauch et al . , 2000 ) . This suggests that the increased matrix mineralization in our PLS3 patient ( Patient 2 ) results primarily from a long history of very low bone turnover . Indeed , the mineralization of bone tissue increases with time and it takes years for a newly formed bone packet to become fully mineral - ized . Thus , in a situation where little or no bone is remodeled , one would expect a rising of the mineral content of the bone matrix and high bone matrix mineralization making the bone tissue stiffer , harder and more brittle ( Roschger et al . , 2008 ; Bishop 2016 ) . It has to be underlined that during skeletal growth , bone turnover is generally increased and the bone matrix tends to be rather lower mineralized than hypermineralized ( Fratzl - Zelman et al . , 2009 ) . Interestingly , the highly trabecularized cortical envelopes observed in our patient suggest that bone modeling remains active in the PLS3 patient . An ongoing cortical bone formation represents possibly a compensatory mecha - nism to counteract the lack of an adequate amount of trabecular bone . It seems very likely that bone fragility in Patient 2 results from a decrease in bone mass that can only be inadequately compensated by increased primary bone formation and from alteration of bone material properties similar to that seen in children with OI . Genotype – phenotype correlation in terms of bone material prop - erties is difficult as there is limitation in obtaining a transiliac bone biopsy from all patients due to its invasive nature . Phenotypic variabili - ty even with the same family is a well - observed genetics phenomenon and often complex to explain . PLS3 - osteoporosis reports so far include large pedigrees with a combination of whole gene deletions , intragenic deletions ( likely resulting in haploinsufficiency in females or complete absence of plastin 3 in males ) , frameshift , splice site and missense var - iants ( likely resulting in truncated or abnormal protein ) which makes direct correlation of bone material properties difficult . From the PLS3 patients in who bone material analyses has been undertaken so far , we could cautiously conclude that PLS3 does have a role in bone minerali - zation , although the effect of it may be dependent on age and timing of bone biopsy . However , further reports of this nature are required to reproduce the effect of PLS3 on bone material and elucidate the exact function of PLS3 in bone . Lindert et al . ( 2016 ) identified variants in MBTPS2 in two families with several affected males identifying another X - linked gene resulting in heritable bone fragility ( Lindert et al . , 2016 ) . The phenotype of these patients was not in keeping with the diagnosis of IJO and was sugges - tive of a severe OI phenotype . In addition to the implicit benefit of screening for PLS3 , the literature suggests that it would also be benefi - cial to screen LRP5 / 6 and WNT1 in patients with a presumed diagnosis of IJO . The proteins encoded by these genes form part of a major bone anabolic pathway ; variants in genes for other factors interacting with the pathway including WNT3a , DKK1 , and LRP4 have all also been associated with low bone mass and fracture .

CaMean : the mean calcium concentration ( weighted mean ) ; CaPeak : the most frequently occurring calcium concentration ( the peak position of the BMDD ) in the sample ; CaWidth : the width of the BMDD distribution ( full width at half maximum ) reflecting the heterogeneity in matrix mineralization ; CaLow : the percentage of low mineralized bone area , which is mineralized below 17 . 68 wt . % calcium , normally reflecting bone areas undergoing primary mineralization ; and CaHigh : the percentage of highly mineralized bone matrix , having the calcium content above 25 . 30 wt . % calcium . a Published values from Fratzl - Zelman et al . ( 2009 ) . b Published values from Roschger et al . ( 2008 ) ( for cancellous OI bone ) and c Fratzl - Zelman et al . ( 2016 ) ( for cortical OI bone ) . 1584 | BALASUBRAMANIAN ET AL . cause opposing effects on the bone density of the patient ; a loss - of - function variant causes osteoporosis - pseudoglioma ( OPPG ) ( Biha et al . , 2016 ; Hartikka et al . , 2005 ; Palsgaard et al . , 2016 ) , whereas a gain - of - function variant can cause dramatic increases in bone density ( Niziolek et al . , 2015 ) . Confirming the genetic etiology in IJO / childhood - onset primary osteoporosis is important due to implications for patients ’ diag - nosis and treatment ; for the wider family in terms of cascade screening especially in a X - linked condition , providing accurate information on recurrence risk ( as in Patient 1 where there is no risk for his unaffected sons which is reassuring for the family ) . In conclusion , IJO / childhood - onset primary osteoporosis can be a complicated diagnosis , resulting from early onset bone fragility . We recommend that all young male patients with this prospective diagnosis undergo diagnostic analysis of PLS3 , either as part of targeted gene panel testing for bone fragility or a single gene testing where there is reduced access to genomic sequencing technologies . Given the emerging phenotype of PLS3 - osteoporosis , further case reports of this nature are important to expand on the spectrum of clinical presentation and add to the PLS3 mutation database .
