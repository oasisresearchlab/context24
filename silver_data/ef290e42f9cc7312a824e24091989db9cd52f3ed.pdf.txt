European Journal of Educational Research , 7 ( 3 ) , 731 - 738 . doi : 10 . 12973 / eu - jer . 7 . 3 . 731 Introduction In the past few decades , the researchers have focused on the effect of variables such as the individuals ' general ability , cognitive process , feelings , motivation , developmental characteristics , and preliminary information , past experiences , social environment , and family on the learning . All of these different variables reveal the individual differences and differentiate the learning processes ( Erden & Altun , 2006 ) . Moreover some of the students in the same learning environment during the teaching process are successful at the end of the process , while some of them fail . Feeling anxiety about the exams that are important in evaluating the achievement of students ( Hancock , 2001 ; Hill & Wigfield , 1984 ) , having not the efficient and effective study skills and using the inadequate study strategies causes students to fail ( Kucukahmet , 2000 ; Yesilyaprak , 2000 ) . Students who acquire the effective study skills do not only learn one particular topic , but also they learn how to learn ( Thomas , 1993 ) . The meaningful or rote learning is another factor that affects the success of students . When learners are integrated the preliminary information with the new information presented to them , meaningful learning is provided through reorganizing ( Ausubel , 1968 , as cited in Acikgoz , 2008 ) . The students’ rote or meaningful learning is associated with learning approaches ( Chin & Brown , 2000 ) . The learning approach has also been investigated in relation to the academic achievement , as an individual - difference variable ( Zhang , 2000 ) . The students’ approaches based on the learning ( deep or surface ) are described as incorporating both the strategy and the reasons of adopting the strategy ( Prosser & Millar , 1989 ) . The learning approaches state how learners approach to academic tasks ( Mattick , Dennis & Bligh , 2004 ) . The constructs of deep and surface approaches related to the learning were introduced firstly by Marton and Sӓljo ( 1976 ) . The third approach was then added in addition to these two approaches . Biggs ( 1979 ) described this approach as an " achieving approach " and Entwistle and Ramsden ( 1983 ) described it as a “strategic approach” . “The Study Process Questionnaire” which is used in this study examines the learners ' learning approaches in deep and surface . Learners adopting the surface approach have the minimum interaction with the learning task ( Smith & Colby , 2007 ) . Learners do not connect the learned topics with their individual experiences . The most frequently strategy which is used by students who adopt the surface approach is the memorization without the meaningful learning ( Beattie , Collins & McInnes , 1997 ; Biggs , 1993 ; Entwisle , 2000 ; Marton * Corresponding author : Sinem Dincol Ozgur , Hacettepe University , Department of Chemistry Education , Ankara , Turkey . Email : sinemdincol @ gmail . com 732  DINCOL OZGUR & YILMAZ / Teachers’ Learning Approaches and Inorganic Chemistry Achievements & Säljo , 1997 ) . The desire on passing the course or the fear of failure at the course are the motivating factors for students who adopt the surface learning approach . They memorize and repeat the topics that can be asked in the exams ( Newble & Entwistle , 1986 ) . The students adopting the deep approach configure a new information with the current knowledge meaningfully and correlate the concepts to the experiences in their daily life . Their main objectives are to learn by understanding . The students adopting the deep approach enjoy in learning , and they hold the information in long - term memory . The deep learners examine the rationale of the claims and interpretations which are presented to them ( Ashcroft & Foreman - Peck , 1994 ; Beattie et al . , 1997 ; Entwistle , 2000 ; Newble & Entwistle , 1986 ; Ramsden , 2000 ; Williams , 1992 ) . The individuals who adopt the deep approach use also the metacognitive strategies such as self - questioning , self - evaluation of ideas and detection of errors ( Marshall & Case , 2005 ) . In the study , pre - service chemistry teachers’ inorganic chemistry achievements and their learning approaches are intended to examine . The chemistry plays an important role in explaining many events that occur in the daily life . As it contains the abstract concepts , the chemistry course is found difficult by the students and they have difficulties in understanding the chemistry ( Abraham , Grzybowski , Renner & Marek , 1992 ; Beerenwinkel , Parchmann & Gräsel , 2011 ; Boo & Watson , 2001 ; Bradley & Mosimege , 1998 ; Garnett , Garnett & Hackling , 1995 ; Johnstone , 2000 ; Kizilaslan , 2013 ; Nakhleh , 1992 ; Orgill & Bodner , 2004 ) . A significant part of the chemistry field is the inorganic chemistry . The inorganic chemistry is a branch of chemistry that examines the characteristics of substances ( elements and compounds ) that are not organic , such as nonliving matter and minerals which are found in the earth ' s crust , their chemical and physical properties , and their tendency to react . The recent developments have shown that it is not only integrated with the other areas of chemistry such as organic , analytical and physical chemistry however covers areas of science such as physics , biology and geology . The Inorganic Chemistry I and Inorganic Chemistry II courses are compulsory courses which are taught in the chemistry teacher program in Faculty of Education . One of the main goal of the educational psychology is also to teach teachers to be a good learner and a good teacher . The teacher who is a good learner namely who is aware of his / her own learning process , will gain these skills effectively to their students . Thus , it will happen spontaneously that the teacher is a good teacher ( Dembo , 2001 ) . For this reason , it is important that the pre - service teachers who will become teachers in the future being successful in their undergraduate educations and which learning approaches they adopted . In the study , the pre - service chemistry teachers have taken the Inorganic Chemistry I course in the same content and with the same teaching methods and techniques , from the same lecturer . However , it has been determined that there were differences between the inorganic chemistry achievement levels of the pre - service chemistry teachers . It has been indicated that there is a positive relationship between the individuals ' learning approaches and academic achievements ( Albaili , 1995 ; Bernardo , 2003 ; Biyikli , 2016 ; Byrne , Flood & Willis , 2002 ; Diseth & Martinsen , 2003 ; Mayya , Rao & Ramnarayan , 2004 ; Murphy & Alexander , 2002 ; Stiernborg & Bandaranayeke , 1996 ; Trigwell & Prosser , 1991 ) . This study addressed the gap in literature about the effect of learning approaches on the pre - service chemistry teachers’ inorganic chemistry achievements . In this regard , the purposes of this study are to explore the relationship between the inorganic chemistry achievement and the adopted learning approach of pre - service chemistry teachers and to examine the effect of their learning approaches on their inorganic chemistry achievement . The following research questions were addressed : 1 . What are the adopted learning approaches of pre - service chemistry teachers ? 2 . What are the inorganic chemistry achievement levels of pre - service chemistry teachers ? 3 . Is there any significant correlation between pre - service chemistry teachers’ inorganic chemistry achievement levels and their adopted learning approach ? 4 . Is there any effect of learning approach on the pre - service chemistry teachers ' inorganic chemistry achievement ? Methodology Research Model In this study , the correlational research was used to determine the relationships between the inorganic chemistry achievements and learning approaches of pre - service chemistry teachers . The main purpose of a correlational research is determining the relationships between two or more variables or using them to make predictions ( Gay & Airasian , 2000 ) . Study Group This study was conducted with 127 pre - service chemistry teachers ( 42 male and 85 female ) from the Department of Chemistry Education at one of the public university in Turkey . The participants were approximately at 19 - 22 years old and have taken the inorganic chemistry I course from the same lecturer . Content and Teaching of Inorganic Chemistry I Course The pre - service chemistry teachers have taken inorganic chemistry I course in the fall semester of the second - class . In teaching of inorganic chemistry course , direct instruction , question and answer , class discussion and modelling methods and techniques are used . European Journal of Educational Research  733 Inorganic Chemistry I course contains the topics such as the electron structure of atom , chemical bonding , transition metals and coordination compounds , nomenclature of coordination compounds , chemical bonding in coordination compounds , theories of chemical bonding , effective atomic number ( EAN ) rule , valence bond theory ( VBT ) , molecular orbital theory ( MOT ) and crystal field theory ( CFT ) . Data Collection Tools “The Study Process Questionnaire” and “Inorganic Chemistry Achievement Exams” were used as the data collection tools in the current study . The Study Process Questionnaire ( SPQ ) : SPQ which was developed by Biggs ( 1987 ) , revised by Biggs , Kember and Leung ( 2001 ) and adapted into Turkish by Yilmaz and Orhan ( 2011 ) was used to determine the pre - service chemistry teachers’ learning approaches . The adapted SPQ consists of 20 items with a five - point Likert - type scale and 2 factors which are the deep approach ( 10 - item ) and surface approach ( 10 - item ) . Cronbach Alpha coefficients values were calculated for the deep approach factor as 0 . 79 and the surface approach factor as 0 . 73 ( Yilmaz & Orhan , 2011 ) . Inorganic Chemistry Achievement Exams : During the semester , the pre - service chemistry teachers have two midterm exams and one final exam in the inorganic chemistry course . The examples of inorganic chemistry exam questions are given in Table 1 . In the determination of achievement level , 50 % of midterm exams levels and 50 % of final level have been taken . The course achievement level of the pre - service chemistry teachers is labelled according to alphabetical system . In this system , “A” is very successful , “B” is successful , “C” is middle level , “D” is passing grade and “F” is failure . The score’s interval which is represented by the alphabetical system is as : A : 100 - 85 , B : 84 - 70 , C : 69 - 55 , D : 54 - 50 and F : 49 - 0 . Table 1 .

The results which are obtained to examine whether this distribution is statistically significant or not are presented in Table 5 . Table 5 . Chi - square tests Value df Asymp .

The minimum expected count is 2 , 87 . When Table 5 is examined , it has been seen that the number of pores which are smaller than the expected value of 5 in this analysis exceeds 20 % ( 30 % ) of the total number of pores . However , when the expected count value is above of 2 ( E ij ≥2 ) , it is possible to interpret the significance test because the chi - squared distribution assumption is valid ( Saracbasi & Aktas - Altunay , 2016 ) . According to the results which were obtained ; it has been determined that the differences which are observed in the inorganic chemistry achievement levels of pre - service chemistry teachers who adopted the different learning approaches are significant in the positive direction [ χ 2 = 12 . 904 , p < . 05 ] . There is a significant relationship between the inorganic chemistry achievement levels of pre - service chemistry teachers and their adopted learning approaches . According to Somers ' d value could be said that the adopted learning approach of pre - service teachers has 34 % effect on their inorganic chemistry achievement [ Somers’d value ( achievement dependent ) = . 341 , p = . 000 ; p ≤ . 01 ] . European Journal of Educational Research  735 Discussion and Conclusion The current study examined the relationship between the pre - service chemistry teachers’ inorganic chemistry achievements and their adopted learning approaches and explored the effect of learning approaches on their inorganic chemistry achievements . Consequently , the greater part of pre - service chemistry teachers adopted the deep learning approach and the others adopted the surface learning approach . In the literature , it has been determined that most of teacher candidates adopt the deep learning approach ( Besoluk & Onder , 2010 ; Sezgin - Selcuk , Caliskan & Erol , 2007 ) . Ilkorucu ( 2017 ) and Oguz and Karakus ( 2017 ) reported that most of pre - service science teachers adopted the deep approach . As a result of this study , it was found that pre - service chemistry teachers ' inorganic chemistry course achievement levels were mostly A ( 35 . 4 % ) , followed by B ( 31 . 5 % ) , C ( 19 . 7 % ) , F ( 7 . 9 % ) and D ( 5 . 5 % ) respectively . The pre - service teachers who had A and B levels adopted mostly the deep approach ( 73 . 3 % - 65 % ) but those who had C , D and F levels adopted mostly the surface approach ( 56 % - 71 . 4 % - 70 % ) . Furthermore , it was found that there was a significant relationship between the inorganic chemistry achievement levels of the pre - service chemistry teachers and their adopted learning approach , and the adopted learning approach had 34 % effect on their inorganic chemistry achievement according to Somers’d value . The surface learning refers to the rote learning and more temporary learning . However , the deep learning involves the learning with real understanding and the deep learning is related to sophisticated learning outcomes than the surface approaches ( Case & Gunstone , 2003 ; Entwisle , 2000 ; Newble & Entwistle , 1986 ; Williams , 1992 ) . Gordon and Debus ( 2002 ) stated that the higher quality learning would be with the greater usage of deep approaches . The results of this study are corroborated with the earlier studies in which a positive correlation was found between high achievement grades and the deep learning approach ( Bernardo , 2003 ; Booth , Luckett & Mladenovic , 1999 ; Byrne et al . , 2002 ; Gow , Kember & Cooper , 1994 ) . As the results of studies , there was a meaningful relationship between the achievements and learning approaches of the students ( Albaili , 1995 ; Bernardo , 2003 ; Biyikli , 2016 ; Diseth & Martinsen , 2003 ; Duff , 2004 ; Mayya et al . , 2004 ; Murphy & Alexander , 2002 ; Sezgin - Selcuk et al . , 2007 ; Stiernborg & Bandaranayeke , 1996 ; Trigwell & Prosser , 1991 ) . Although it was found that the majority of the pre - service chemistry teachers adopted the deep learning approach ( 59 . 1 % ) , the proportion of them who adopted the surface learning approach ( 40 . 9 % ) are also high . It was stated in the literature that being a good instructor will be achieved by being a good learner and the educators who are aware of their own learning process can effectively gain these skills to their students ( Dembo , 2001 ; Thomas , 1993 ) . Students could change their approach depending on their interests and perceptions towards the subjects to learn ( Duff , Boyle , Dunleavy & Ferguson , 2004 ) . The learning approach is influenced by the variables such as the subject area , learning environment , the relationship between the learners and subject of study and the evaluation criteria in the learning - teaching process ( Aydogdu & Ergin , 2010 ; Biyikli , 2016 ; Dart et al . , 2000 ; Nelson Laird , Shoup , Kuh & Schwarz , 2008 ; Reid , Duvall & Evans , 2007 ) . It was found that when learners have positive perceptions about the nature of learning environments and are in the student - centered learning environments , they mostly adopt the deep approach . It was also determined when they have negative perceptions about the nature of learning environments and are only in the teacher - centered learning environments , they adopt mostly the surface approach ( Pimparyon , Caleer , Pemba & Roff , 2000 ; Beausaert , Segers & Wiltink , 2013 ; Trigwell , Prosser & Waterhouse , 1999 ) . Gibbs and Coffey ( 2004 ) stated that after their teachers had been trained about the teaching skills , the teaching approaches and learning approaches of students , the students adopted a surface approach to significantly lesser extent . Shahri , Rahman and Hussain ( 2017 ) stated that the Jigsaw technique in the cooperative learning improves the students’ deep learning approach . In the interventions aimed at improving the quality of student learning in higher education , it is needed to modify the perceptions of students about learning and studying for modifying to their behaviour ( Richardson & Price , 2003 ) . These efforts are significant for individuals to be successful in their lives and to be life - long learner . Recommendations It could be said that this study is unique in terms of determining the adopted learning approaches of pre - service chemistry teachers and the relationship between the learning approaches and the inorganic chemistry achievements . The result of study displays that there is a relationship between the achievements and learning approaches of pre - service chemistry teachers . Providing meaningful learning for inorganic chemistry is important for the pre - service teachers who will become the chemistry teachers since it is the basis for the other chemistry courses such as analytical chemistry , organic chemistry , physical chemistry that they will take during the undergraduate education . Thus , they could teach chemistry to their students meaningfully and effectively . It is expected that individuals will prefer the deep learning approach for meaningful learning . For this reason , the pre - service teachers should be trained in the student - centered learning environments during their undergraduate education and they should be directed to adopt the deep approach and to use strategies towards this approach . Thus , they will create the learning environments that will direct their students to deep approach and provide the meaningful learning for them . In the further research , the learning approaches of learners could be determined and the interventions could be made in order to improve their learning approaches . 736  DINCOL OZGUR & YILMAZ / Teachers’ Learning Approaches and Inorganic Chemistry Achievements References Abraham , M .
