In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Dot1 - mediated H3K79 methylation is associated with telomere silencing , meiotic checkpoint control , and DNA damage response . The biological function of H3K79 methylation in mammals , however , remains poorly understood . Using gene targeting , we generated mice deficient for Dot1L , the murine Dot1 homologue . Dot1L - deficient embryos show multiple developmental abnormalities , including growth impairment , angiogenesis defects in the yolk sac , and cardiac dilation , and die between 9 . 5 and 10 . 5 days post coitum . To gain insights into the cellular function of Dot1L , we derived embryonic stem ( ES ) cells from Dot1L mutant blastocysts . Dot1L - deficient ES cells show global loss of H3K79 methylation as well as reduced levels of heterochromatic marks ( H3K9 di - methylation and H4K20 tri - methylation ) at centromeres and telomeres . These changes are accompanied by aneuploidy , telomere elongation , and proliferation defects . Taken together , these results indicate that Dot1L and H3K79 methylation play important roles in heterochromatin formation and in embryonic development .

These modifications dictate chromatin structure by affecting the recruitment of nonhistone proteins and / or the interactions between nucleosomes [ 1 , 2 ] . Heterochromatin is associated with high levels of methylation at H3K9 , H3K27 , and H4K20 and low levels of acetylation , whereas actively transcribed euchromatin is typically enriched with acetylation and methylated H3K4 , H3K36 , and H3K79 . Most histone H3 modifications occur on residues within the N - terminal tail . In contrast , H3K79 is located in a loop within the globular domain , exposed on the nucleosome surface . The yeast Dot1 and its homologues in other species are the only known H3K79 methyltransferases [ 3 – 5 ] . Unlike other histone lysine methyltransferases , Dot1 family members do not have a SET domain [ 3 – 5 ] . Instead , their catalytic domain contains conserved sequence motifs characteristic of class I methyltransferases such as DNA methyltransferases ( DNMTs ) and the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT1 [ 6 ] . Dot1 was initially identified as a disruptor of telomeric silencing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [ 3 ] . Subsequent studies showed that both overexpression and inactivation of Dot1 as well as mutations at H3K79 all lead to loss of telomeric silencing [ 7 – 9 ] . Although the mechanisms by which Dot1 affects telomere structure and function are not fully understood , it is believed that H3K79 methylation plays an important role in restricting the Sir proteins at heterochromatic regions [ 7 , 8 , 10 ] . Dot1 - dependent H3K79 methylation has also been shown to be involved in meiotic checkpoint control and in G1 and S phase DNA damage checkpoint functions of Rad9 in yeast [ 11 , 12 ] . H3K79 methylation is also a widespread histone modification in mammalian cells [ 4 ] . Abnormal H3K79 methylation has been linked to leukemogenesis in humans [ 13 , 14 ] . However , the biological function of H3K79 methylation in mammals remains largely unknown . Here we generated a mouse line containing a null mutation in Dot1L , the murine Dot1 homologue , and investigated the role of Dot1L and H3K79 methylation in embryonic development and cellular function . We provide evidence that Dot1L is required for embryogenesis and for the integrity of constitutive heterochromatin at the cellular level . Results Generation of Dot1L Conditional and Null Alleles in Mice To target the Dot1L gene , we constructed a targeting vector in which a 2 . 3 - kb genomic region containing exons 5 and 6 and a promoterless b - geo selection cassette were flanked , respectively , by PLoS Genetics | www . plosgenetics . org 1 September 2008 | Volume 4 | Issue 9 | e1000190 three loxP sites ( Figure 1A ) . Exons 5 and 6 encode 108 amino acids that form several conserved motifs in the Dot1L catalytic domain , including the SAM - binding motif and motifs X , I , and II [ 6 ] . Since mutations of conserved residues within motif I abolish the methyltransferase activity of Dot1L [ 4 ] , we predicted that deletion of exons 5 and 6 would inactivate Dot1L . ES cells were transfected with the targeting vector and selected in G418 - containing medium . Clones with homologous recombi - nation were identified by Southern blot analysis with a 5 9 external probe ( Figure 1B ) . Three of these clones , referred to as Dot1L 3lox / + , were injected into blastocysts to generate chimeric mice , which subsequently transmitted the mutant allele to their offspring . Deletion of the b - geo cassette plus exons 5 and 6 was achieved by breeding the Dot1L 3lox allele into mice expressing Cre recombinase in the germ line . The resulting null allele is referred to as Dot1L 1lox ( Figure 1A ) . Genotypes were determined using PCR ( Figure 1C ) . Dot1L Is Essential for Embryonic Development We first determined the expression of Dot1L during embryonic development , taking advantage of the fact that cells containing the Dot1L 3lox allele express lacZ under the control of the endogenous Dot1L promoter . We conducted X - gal staining on Dot1L 3lox / + heterozygous embryos and wild - type littermates at different stages of development . Dot1L expression is ubiquitous as early as 7 . 5 - dpc ( the earliest time point tested , Figure 2A ) . At 9 . 5 - dpc , Dot1L expression remains ubiquitous and areas of elevated expression are Author Summary Histone methylation plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression and chromatin structure . Among the sites of histone methylation , lysine 79 of histone H3 ( H3K79 ) is unique in that it is not located within the H3 N - terminal tail but in the globular domain . Our knowledge about H3K79 methylation comes primarily from studies in yeast . This study focuses on the role of H3K79 methylation in mammalian development and cellular function . We show that genetic disruption of Dot1L , the only known H3K79 methyltransferase gene in mouse , results in embryonic lethality . At the cellular level , Dot1L deficiency leads to alterations in constitutive heterochromatin , accompanied by telomere elongation , aneuploidy , and proliferation defects . Our work represents a key step toward under - standing the function of H3K79 methylation in mammals . Figure 1 . Generation of mutant Dot1L alleles in mice .

Tissues that demonstrate high levels of lacZ staining include the optic vesicle , the first branchial arch , the limb buds , the heart , the otic pit , and the neural ectoderm ( Figure 2B ) . Dot1L is also expressed at high levels in extra - embryonic tissues , including the visceral endoderm and visceral mesoderm of the yolk sac , and in primitive erythrocytes ( Figure 2C ) . Similar lacZ staining patterns are observed in embryos harvested at 10 . 5 - dpc , 11 . 5 - dpc , and 12 . 5 - dpc ( data not shown ) , suggesting that Dot1L is broadly expressed during embryonic development . Dot1L 1lox / + mice were grossly normal and fertile . However , intercrosses of Dot1L 1lox / + mice produced no viable Dot1L 1lox / 1lox homozygous offspring , suggesting embryonic lethality ( Table 1 ) . Dot1L 1lox / 1lox embryos harvested at 8 . 5 - dpc were indistinguishable from wild - type and Dot1L 1lox / + littermates ( data not shown ) . At 9 . 5 - dpc , Dot1L 1lox / 1lox embryos were smaller than littermates , had enlarged hearts and stunted tails on gross observation when viewed Figure 2 .

Approximately 15 % of the Dot1L 1lox / 1lox embryos demonstrated a severe phenotype , exhibiting developmental arrest at E8 . 5 ( Figure 2D , right ) . Histological examination of 9 . 5 - dpc Dot1L 1lox / 1lox embryo sections revealed focal areas of extensive apoptosis , but no obvious structural defects ( Figure S1 ) . At 10 . 5 - dpc , the percentage of viable Dot1L 1lox / 1lox embryos was substantially below the expected Mendelian ratio ( Table 1 ) , suggesting that many of the Dot1L 1lox / 1lox embryos die during this time interval . The few that survived to this stage exhibited developmental arrest at E9 . 5 and severe cardiac dilation ( Figure 2E ) . No Dot1L 1lox / 1lox embryos survived beyond 10 . 5 - dpc ( Table 1 ) . As stunted growth and enlarged heart are phenotypes that often occur as a result of defects in extraembryonic tissues , we examined the yolk sac and placenta of 9 . 5 - dpc Dot1L 1lox / 1lox embryos . While the placenta showed no obvious defects , the yolk sac exhibited abnormal vascular morphology . The yolk sac vasculature was present and contained primitive erythrocytes , but was frequently underdeveloped and disorganized when compared to control littermates ( Figure 2F ) . These observations indicate that , in the absence of Dot1L , vasculogenesis took place in the yolk sac but angiogenesis was defective . Dot1L Deficiency in ES Cells Results in Growth Defects To investigate the cellular function of Dot1L , we derived Dot1L mutant ES cells from blastocysts produced from intercrosses of Dot1L 1lox / + mice . Two Dot1L 1lox / 1lox and multiple Dot1L 1lox / + and Dot1L + / + lines were established . As expected , H3K79 di - and tri - methylation was greatly reduced in Dot1L 1lox / 1lox cells compared to Dot1L + / + cells ( Figure 3A ) . Dot1L 1lox / + cells had intermediate levels of H3K79 di - and tri - methylation , indicating haploinsufficiency of Dot1L ( Figure 3A ) . Surprisingly , Western blot analysis using a ‘‘mono methyl H3K79’’ antibody ( ab2886 , Abcam ) detected no change in signal intensity in Dot1L mutant ES cell lines ( data not shown ) . To verify the results , we carried out mass spectrometry . In wild - type ES cells , , 11 % of histone H3 showed K79 methylation , among which mono - , di - , and tri - methylation accounted for , 70 % , , 30 % , and less than 1 % , respectively . In Dot1L 1lox / 1lox ES cells , H3K79 mono - and tri - methylation was absent although trace amount of di - methylation was detected ( Figure 3B and Figure S2 ) . We therefore concluded that the Western blot result showing no alteration in H3K79 mono - methylation in the absence of Dot1L was an artifact due to nonspecific recognition of histone H3 by the ‘‘mono methyl H3K79’’ antibody . The low level of H3K79 di - Figure 3 . Phenotypic analysis of Dot1L mutant ES cells .

Quantification of different forms of H3K79 methylation was obtained by comparing the extracted ion chromatogram ( EIC ) intensity of the ion signals corresponding to the unmodified ( Me0 ) , mono - methylated ( Me1 ) , di - methylated ( Me2 ) , and tri - methylated ( Me3 ) K79 - containing peptides . ( C ) The proliferation of Dot1L + / + , Dot1L 1lox / + and Dot1L 1lox / 1lox ES cells was determined by doing cell counts every 24 hours for five days .

Taken together , these results indicated that Dot1L is most likely the sole H3K79 methyltransferase in mice . Dot1L mutant ES cells maintained an undifferentiated state , as judged by morphology and ES cell markers such as Oct4 and Nanog ( data not shown ) . We investigated whether Dot1L deficiency affects ES cell growth . We plated 3 6 10 5 Dot1L + / + , Dot1L 1lox / + , and Dot1L 1lox / 1lox ES cells in standard ES cell medium and monitored proliferation . By 24 hours , the number of Dot1L + / + ES cells ( 7 . 3 6 10 5 ) was significantly higher than the number of Dot1L 1lox / + or Dot1L 1lox / 1lox cells ( 4 . 2 6 10 5 and 3 . 6 6 10 5 respective - ly , P , 0 . 05 , Figure 3C ) . Over the 5 days examined , Dot1L + / + , Dot1L 1lox / + , and Dot1L 1lox / 1lox ES cells had average doubling times of 16 , 22 , and 26 hours , respectively . The fact that both Dot1L 1lox / + and Dot1L 1lox / 1lox cells exhibited growth defects showed the importance of Dot1L gene dosage in cellular function . The reduction of H3K79 methylation in Dot1L 1lox / + cells ( haploinsuffi - ciency ) suggested that Dot1L level is relatively low . Interestingly , Dot1L 1lox / + mice were apparently normal despite the defects in Dot1L 1lox / + ES cells . It is possible that 50 % of Dot1L can barely maintain normal cellular function under ideal conditions ( e . g . in vivo ) but is not sufficient to do so under suboptimal conditions ( e . g . in culture ) . We next examined apoptosis and cell cycle status of the Dot1L mutant ES cells . Annexin V staining revealed that 4 . 0 % of the Dot1 1lox / 1lox ES cells and 3 . 1 % of the Dot1L 1lox / + ES cells were annexin V positive , while only 1 . 2 % of the Dot1L + / + ES cells were annexin V positive ( Figure 3D ) . This indicates that more than twice as many of the Dot1L mutant ES cells were undergoing apoptosis compared to wild - type ES cells . Furthermore , cell cycle analysis by propidium iodide staining revealed an elevated percentage of G2 cells and a reduced percentage of G1 cells among the Dot1L mutant ES cells when compared to the wild - type ES cells ( Figure 3E ) . These results suggest that both elevated apoptosis and G2 cell cycle arrest contribute to the reduced growth rate of Dot1L mutant ES cells . Dot1L - Deficient ES Cells Show Telomere Elongation and Aneuploidy Dot1 - deficient S . cerevisiae show telomere elongation and defects in telomere silencing [ 3 ] . We therefore evaluated the effect of Dot1L inactivation on telomere length . First , we used Southern blot terminal restriction fragment ( TRF ) analysis to estimate telomere length in two ES cell lines of each Dot1L genotype . Both Dot1L 1lox / 1lox lines and one of the Dot1L 1lox / + lines showed telomere elongation , as evidenced by the presence of high molecular weight ( MW ) TRFs and the increase in the lengths of bulk TRFs compared to wild - type controls ( Figure 4A ) . Next , we carried out quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization ( Q - FISH ) using a telomere - specific probe to determine the mean telomere length ( mtl ) and the distribution of telomere lengths for each cell line ( Figure 4 , B and C ) . Consistent with the TRF results , both Dot1L 1lox / 1lox lines had higher mtl , greater percentages of elongated ( . 100 kb ) telomeres , and reduced percentages of short ( , 50 kb ) telomeres compared to Dot1L + / + lines ( Figure 4C ) . The heterozy - gous ES cells again showed an intermediate phenotype ( Figure 4C ) . Examination of the Q - FISH samples revealed frequent aneuploidy in Dot1L - deficient cells ( Figure 4B ) . To further investigate this phenotype , we prepared metaphase chromosome spreads from Dot1L 1lox / 1lox and Dot1L + / + ES cells and examined them for chromosomal defects . Dot1L + / + cells were karyotypically stable , as the vast majority had 40 chromosomes . In contrast , over 40 % of metaphase Dot1L 1lox / 1lox cells were aneuploid . Most of the aneuploid cells showed gain of chromosomes and some ended up being tetraploid ( Figure 4 , B and D ) . Aside from aneuploidy , no obvious chromosomal abnormalities were frequently observed in Dot1L - deficient cells ( Figure 4B ) . These results point to defects in chromosome segregation in the absence of Dot1L . Aberrant Telomere Elongation in Dot1L - Deficient Cells Correlates with Activation of the ALT Pathway Our data suggested a role for Dot1L in the homeostasis of telomere length . Two main mechanisms have been described for the maintenance of mammalian telomeres : the addition of telomeric repeats by telomerase and the so - called alternative lengthening of telomere ( ALT ) mechanism that relies on homologous recombination between telomeric sequences [ 15 , 16 ] . Dot1L mutant ES cells showed increased telomere heterogeneity ( Figure 4 ) , which is a hallmark of ALT cells [ 17 ] . To determine whether the ALT pathway is activated in Dot1L - deficient cells , we assessed the presence of ALT - associated PML bodies ( APBs , colocalization of PML and telomeres ) , another hallmark of ALT [ 17 ] . Dot1L + / + , Dot1L 1lox / 1lox , as well as Dnmt3a 2 / 2 3b 2 / 2 ( positive control ) ES cells were immuno - stained with antibodies against TRF1 ( a telomere - binding protein ) and PML . In the absence of Dot1L , both the frequency of cells showing APBs and the number of APBs per cell were significantly increased compared to wild - type cells ( Figure 5 , A – C , x 2 tests , P , 0 . 001 ) , suggesting that aberrant elongation of telomeres in Dot1L - deficient cells was due , at least in part , to activation of the ALT pathway . Dot1L Deficiency Results in Loss of Heterochromatin Marks at Telomeres and Centromeres Aneuploidy and telomere elongation can result from defects in the chromatin structure at centromeres and telomeres , respectively [ 18 – 23 ] . To evaluate changes in chromatin structure in Dot1L mutant cells , we used chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) to examine histone modifications at major satellite repeats ( present at pericentric regions ) , minor satellite repeats ( present at centromeric regions ) , telomeric repeats , and subtelomeric regions ( Figure 6 ) . H3K79 di - methylation was detected in all these heterochromatin regions in Dot1L + / + cells ( Figure 6 , A and B ) . As expected , this modification was reduced in Dot1L 1lox / + cells and almost absent in Dot1L 1lox / 1lox cells ( Figure 6 , A and B ) , validating our experimental procedures . As further controls , the levels of centromere - and telomere - bound histone H3 were similar in wild - type and Dot1L mutant cells ( Figure 6 , A and B ) , and the telomere - binding protein TRF1 associated with telomeric repeats , but not with major satellite repeats ( Figure 6B ) . In Dot1L 1lox / 1lox cells , H4K20 tri - methylation , a hallmark of constitutive heterochromatin , was greatly reduced at minor satellite repeats and sub - telomere regions , and moderately reduced at major satellite repeats ( Figure 6A ) . Consistent with this observation , immunofluorescence analysis revealed the loss of enrichment of H4K20 tri - methylation at pericentric heterochro - matin in the absence of Dot1L ( Figure S3 ) . H3K9 di - methylation , but not H3K9 tri - methylation , was reduced in all regions examined in Dot1L 1lox / 1lox cells ( Figure 6 , A and B ) . Concomitantly , H3K9 mono - methylation showed marked increases at major satellite repeats and minor satellite repeats ( Figure 6A ) , and H3K9 acetylation , a mark of euchromatin , was elevated in all regions examined ( Figure 6 , A and B ) . These changes appeared to be heterochromatin - specific , as all histone modifications examined , except H3K79 methylation , showed no global changes in Dot1L mutant cells ( Figure S4 ) . Dot1L deficiency did not cause Dot1L in Development and Heterochromatin PLoS Genetics | www . plosgenetics . org 5 September 2008 | Volume 4 | Issue 9 | e1000190 alterations in DNA methylation at major satellite repeats and minor satellite repeats as well as other genomic regions such as the intracisternal A - particle ( IAP ) retroviral elements ( Figure S5 ) . Altogether , these results suggest that loss of H3K79 methylation results in a less compacted ( or more open ) chromatin state at centromeres and telomeres . Discussion In this report , we provide genetic evidence that Dot1L and , by implication , H3K79 methylation are essential for mammalian development and normal cellular function . We show that loss of Dot1L results in yolk sac angiogenesis defects and embryonic Figure 4 . Telomere elongation and aneuploidy in Dot1L - deficient ES cells .

Furthermore , our characterization of Dot1L - deficient ES cells reveals that , like in yeast , H3K79 methylation plays a critical role in heterochromatin structure in mammalian cells . Consider - ing the differences in chromatin structure between yeast and mammals , the phenotypic similarities in mutants of these organisms are both striking and surprising . For example , both mutant organisms exhibit telomere elongation , but mammalian telomeres contain H3K79 methylated histones , while S . cerevisiae telomeres contain no histones at all . Furthermore , while , 7 % of the budding yeast genome is packaged as heterochromatin ( including rDNA ) , , 55 % of the mammalian genome is composed of heterochromatin [ 24 ] . Dot1L recruitment is coupled with gene transcription [ 25 ] and H3K79 methylation is enriched in euchromatin , which seem to be counterintuitive to the heterochromatin phenotype of Dot1L - deficient cells . One possible explanation is that Dot1L inactivation alters the expression of specific factors involved in heterochromatin assembly . Alternatively , global loss of H3K79 methylation may result in redistribution of heterochromatin factors , thereby reducing their relative abundance at constitutive heterochromatin . Indeed , loss of Dot1 in yeast leads to mislocalization of the Sir proteins , which promote heterochromatin formation and telomere silencing [ 7 , 8 ] . H3K9 tri - methylation and H4K20 tri - methylation are hallmarks of constitutive heterochromatin , such as that at centromeres and Figure 5 . Increased APBs in Dot1L - deficient cells . ( A ) Confocal microscopy images showing either TRF1 ( telomere marker , green ) , PML ( marker for PML bodies , red ) , or combined fluorescence ( yellow if colocalize , indicated by arrows ) in wild - type ( + / + ) and Dot1L - deficient ( 1lox / 1lox ) ES cells .

Based on the observation that H3K9 tri - methylation by the Suv39h methyltransferases is required for the induction of H4K20 tri - methylation by the Suv4 - 20h methyltrans - ferases at pericentric heterochromatin , a sequential model of chromatin assembly at constitutive heterochromatin has been proposed in which Suv4 - 20h enzymes act downstream of the Suv39h enzymes [ 26 ] . Dot1L - deficient cells show loss of H4K20 tri - methylation at telomeres and centromeres , suggesting that Dot1L functions upstream of the Suv20h enzymes . Given that H3K9 tri - methylation shows no obvious alterations in Dot1L - deficient cells , it is possible that Dot1L acts in parallel or downstream of the Suv39h enzymes . Interestingly , despite the relatively normal levels of H3K9 tri - methylation , H3K9 di - methylation is severely reduced at constitutive heterochromatin in the absence of Dot1L . Because the Figure 6 . Changes of heterochromatin structure in Dot1L - deficient ES cells .

DNA precipitated from 2 . 5 6 10 6 cells were used for each assay . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1000190 . g006 Dot1L in Development and Heterochromatin PLoS Genetics | www . plosgenetics . org 8 September 2008 | Volume 4 | Issue 9 | e1000190 total levels of H3K9 di - methylation and of several H3K9 methyltransferases ( Suv39h1 , ESET , and G9a ) are not altered in Dot1L - deficient cells ( Figure S4 ) , we speculate that Dot1L deficiency may affect the targeting of one or more H3K9 methyltransferases or demethylases to constitutive heterochromatin . Further studies will be required to elucidate the mechanisms by which Dot1L and H3K79 methylation regulate heterochromatin . Perturbation of epigenetic marks at constitutive heterochroma - tin has been shown to cause chromosome instability and telomere elongation [ 20 – 23 ] . Therefore , aberrant changes in chromatin at centromeres and telomeres most likely underlie the aneuploidy and telomere elongation observed in Dot1L - deficient ES cells . How the observed alterations in chromatin structure and cellular function contribute to the developmental abnormalities in Dot1L - deficient embryos is less clear . The requirement of Dot1L for normal cellular function does not appear to be ES cell - specific , as RNAi - mediated Dot1L knock - down in somatic cell lines also leads to growth arrest and cell death [ 13 ] . It is thus probable that intrinsic defects in cellular proliferation and viability , which themselves are likely the result of heterochromatin alterations , contribute to the growth defects and apoptosis observed in Dot1L mutant embryos . However , we believe that yolk sac defects are a major cause of embryonic lethality . In the absence of Dot1L , yolk sac angiogenesis is severely impaired . As both the endoderm and mesoderm cell layers of the visceral yolk sac are critical for blood vessel development [ 28 , 29 ] and both express Dot1L , we speculate that , in the absence of Dot1L , aberrant changes in gene expression and chromatin structure in one or both cell layers may underlie the yolk sac vascular defects . Some embryonic abnormalities , such as cardiac dilation , could be secondary to yolk sac vascular defects . Although Dot1L is also expressed in primitive erythrocytes , loss of Dot1L does not appear to have an obvious impact on erythropoiesis . It remains to be determined , however , whether the erythrocyte function is impaired . Materials and Methods Construction of the Gene Targeting Vector The Dot1L conditional targeting vector , in which a 2 . 3 - kb genomic region containing exons 5 and 6 was flanked by loxP sites , was constructed by sequentially subcloning Dot1L genomic fragments and a floxed b Geo cassette into pBluescript SK ( Stratagene ) . The Dot1L genomic fragments were generated by PCR using mouse genomic DNA as the template . The primer pairs used were : 5 9 - TTC ACT AGT CCC CAC CTT TGG ATT G - 3 9 and 5 9 - GGC ACT AGT GTC ACA CAC CTT TA - 3 9 for the 5 9 arm , 5 9 - CAT GTC GAC ACC GTG TAG TCC TGG TGG GA - 3 9 and 5 9 - CTC GGC CGG CCT TGC CTG TGG CTG ACG - 3 9 for the 3 9 arm , and 5 9 - GAC ACC GGT GCC TGG CAA CCT TTT GG - 3 9 and 5 9 - CTG GGC GCG CCA CCA GGA ACA CAC AGG TAC - 3 9 for the floxed region ( underlined are the restriction sites used for cloning ) . The identity of the vector was verified by DNA sequencing . Generation of Dot1L Mutant Mice The Dot1L conditional targeting vector was transfected into ES cells via electroporation , and transfected cells were selected with G418 . Clones with homologous recombination ( Dot1L 3lox / + ) were identified using Southern blot . Genomic DNA was digested with Eco RI and hybridized with a 5 9 external probe ( The probe was generated by PCR using the following primers : 5 9 - CTC TGG TAC CTT TGT TGT TAT ACA G - 3 9 and 5 9 - CTC TCA AGT CGA CTG TAA GAT GAA G - 3 9 ) . Multiple Dot1L 3lox / + clones were used to generate chimeric mice and F1 heterozygotes . Deletion of exons 5 and 6 as well as the b Geo cassette was achieved by crossing Dot1L 3lox / + mice with Zp3 - Cre transgenic mice , which express the Cre recombinase in the germline . Mutant mice were maintained on a C57BL / 6 inbred or a C57BL / 6 - 129Sv hybrid background . Primers used for PCR genotyping were : DF1 : 5 9 - GGA ACT CAA GCT ATA GAC AG - 3 9 , DR1 : 5 9 - CAC TGC CCA GGT CGA CAA ACA G - 3 9 , and DR2 : 5 9 - ATC CTC TCT CCT GAG GAG GCA GC - 3 9 ( Figure 1 ) . Embryo Collection , X - Gal Staining , and Histology Female mice in Dot1L 1lox / + intercrosses were examined for plug formation to establish the timing of copulation . Deciduas were isolated from euthanized females at various time points following copulation , and embryos were examined under a dissecting microscope . DNA from the yolk sac was used for genotyping by PCR using the primers described above . X - gal staining was performed on 7 . 5 - to 12 . 5 - dpc Dot1L 3lox / + embryos and littermates as previously described [ 30 ] . Embryo , yolk sac , and placental tissue specimens , which were harvested at 9 . 5 - dpc , were fixed in Bouin’s solution , washed extensively in 70 % ethanol , processed routinely for paraffin embedding , sectioned at 5 m m , stained with hematoxylin and eosin , and then evaluated by bright field microscopy . ES Cell Derivation and Culture Dot1L mutant ES cells were derived from blastocysts produced from intercrosses of Dot1L 1lox / + mice , as previously described [ 31 ] . Established ES lines were maintained in ES cell medium [ 32 ] . Apoptosis was analyzed using an Annexin V - PE apoptosis detection kit ( BD Pharmingen ) . Cell cycle analysis was done using a PI / RNase Staining Buffer ( BD Pharmingen ) . Immunofluorescence and Immunoblot Analyses Immunoblot and indirect immunofluorescence analyses were carried out using standard procedures . The following antibodies were used : anti - H3K79Me1 ( Abcam ) , anti - H3K79Me2 ( Abcam ) , anti - H3K79Me3 ( Abcam ) , anti - H3 ( Millipore ) , anti - H3K4Me2 ( Millipore ) , anti - H3K4Me3 ( Millipore ) , anti - H3K9Me1 ( Milli - pore ) , anti - H3K9Me2 ( Millipore ) , anti - H3K9Me3 ( Millipore ) , anti - H3K27Me1 ( Millipore ) , anti - H3K27Me3 ( Millipore ) , anti - H3K9Ac ( Millipore ) , anti - H4K20Me3 ( Millipore ) , anti - H4Ac ( Millipore ) , anti - Suv39h1 ( Upstate ) , anti - ESET ( Upstate ) , anti - G9a ( Cell Signaling ) , anti - TRF1 ( Abcam ) , anti - PML ( Chemicon ) , Alexa 488 - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG ( Molecular probes ) , Alexa 555 - conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG ( Molecular Probes ) , and peroxidase - conjugated goat anti - rabbit and goat anti - mouse IgG ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories ) . Mass Spectrometry Analysis Histone H3 purified from ES cells was digested with trypsin , and the resulting peptides were analyzed using a LTQ - FT mass spectrometer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc . ) hyphenated with an Agilent 1200 HPLC system ( Agilent ) . Identification of the peptides was performed by searching the MS / MS fragmentation data against the histone H3 sequence using MASCOT search software ( Matrix Science , version 2 . 1 ) . All identifications were manually inspected for correctness . The abundance of each identified and validated peptide was calculated from its peak intensity using extracted ion chromatogram ( XIC ) of LC / MS spectra . Relative quantification of different forms of H3K79 methylation was performed by comparing the signal intensities of the tryptic peptide EIAQDFKTDLR at m / z 668 . 35 ( [ MH 2 ] 2 + ) , EIAQDFKmeTDLR at m / z 675 . 36 ( [ MH 2 ] 2 + ) , EIAQDFK2meTDLR at m / z 682 . 35 ( [ MH 2 ] 2 + ) , and EIAQDFK3meTDLR at m / z 689 . 35 ( [ MH 2 ] 2 + ) .

Metaphase Spread Analysis To prepare metaphase spreads , cells were incubated with 0 . 1 m g / ml of colcemid for 4 hours and then harvested and resuspended in 200 m l PBS . 10 ml of 75 mM KCl solution was added dropwise with constant gentle agitation . Cells were fixed by slow addition of 3 : 1 methanol / acetic acid solution , and then dropped onto a microscope slide . Slides were washed in 70 % acetic acid , stained with DAPI and mounted . Chromosome spreads were observed using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope . Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays ChIP was performed using 20 6 10 6 ES cells as described in the online protocol provided by Upstate . Antibody sources are described above . Purified DNA was either analyzed with quantitative real - time PCR ( qPCR ) using Applied Biosystems SYBR PCR mastermix or used in a dot blot assay as described [ 22 ] . qPCR primers used were specific for major satellite repeats , minor satellite repeats [ 33 ] , and subtelomeric regions of chromosome 1 ( forward : 5 9 - TTA GGA CTT CTG GCT TCG GTA G - 3 9 , reverse : 5 9 - AGC TGT GGC AGG CAT CGT GGC - 3 9 ) and chromosome 2 ( forward : 5 9 - GAA TCC TCC CTG TAG CAG GG - 3 9 , reverse : 5 9 - GTA CAT AAC CGA TCC AGG TGT G - 3 9 ) . Relative enrichment was calculated as 2ˆ ( C T ( control CHIP ) - C T ( experimental CHIP ) ) , where C T is equal to the C T ( immunoprecipitated sample ) - C T ( input ) and normalized so that the wild - type value was 1 , with the exception of H3K9Me1 at major satellite repeats where the Dot1L 1lox / 1lox value was 1 . Each sample used in the dot blot contained DNA precipitated from 2 . 5 6 10 6 cells . Probes used were 32 P - labelled oligonucleotides specific for telomeric repeats ( ( TTAGGG ) x11 ) and major satellite repeats ( 5 9 - TAT GGC GAG GAA AAC TGA AAA AGG TGG AAA ATT TAG AAA TGT CCA CTG TAG GAC GTG GAA TAT GGC AAG - 3 9 ) , respectively . DNA Methylation Assay Genomic DNA isolated from ES cells was digested with methylation - sensitive restriction enzymes and analyzed by South - ern hybridization using probes specific for the major satellite repeats , the minor satellite repeats , and the intracisternal A particle retrovirus [ 32 , 34 ] .
