in tumor - bearing KPC mice up - regulated MHC class II and the costimulatory molecule CD86 with expression levels peaking at day 3 and re - turning to baseline after 7 days ( Fig . 3H , and figs . S13 and S14 ) . These changes coincided with a cytokine surge on day 1 after FGK45 treatment , with elevated serum levels of IL - 12 , TNF - a , and IFN - g , but not IL - 10 , in KPC animals ( fig . S15 ) . To determine whether macrophages were necessary for CD40 - mediated tumor regression , we depleted systemic macrophages from KPC mice with CELs . Treatment with CELs abolished the capacity of FGK45 to induce tumor regres - sion ( Fig . 4A ) . Macrophages isolated from the pancreas of tumor - bearing KPC animals treated in vivo with FGK45 lysed tumor cells in vitro ( Fig . 4B ) . This finding correlated with in vivo observations of cleaved caspase 3 expression in focal areas of the tumor at 18 hours after treat - ment with FGK45 ( Fig . 4C ) . At this time after treatment , regions of the tumor stroma and as - sociated fibrosis appeared to be undergoing involution ( Fig . 4 , D to G ) . These regions dis - played a decrease in collagen I content , consist - ent with degradation of the tumor matrix ( Fig . 4 , H and I ) . In KPC mice depleted of systemic macrophages using CELs , FGK45 treatment failed to induce stromal degradation ( Fig . 4 , J to L ) . These findings identify a novel mechanism where - by the CD40 pathway can be harnessed thera - peutically to restore tumor immune surveillance by targeting tumor - infiltrating macrophages in - volved in cancer inflammation . PDA is a common , devastating , and highly lethal tumor for which new therapies are crit - ically needed . Our findings identify a previously unappreciated role for the CD40 pathway in regulating the immune reaction and fibrosis associated with PDA by reeducation of tumor - associated macrophages . Mechanistically , CD40 agonists altered tumor stroma and , in both mice and humans , showed efficacy against PDA . Al - though tumor - suppressing macrophages have been previously described ( 22 ) , their role has been largely linked to the orchestration of T cell antitumor immunity . In this study , CD40 acti - vation was , by itself , insufficient for invoking productive antitumor T cell immunity , and we hypothesize that full engagement of T cell im - munity in PDA after CD40 activation will re - quire modulation of additional tumor and host factors or the incorporation of novel vaccines ( 23 ) . Our results emphasize that tumor immu - nosurveillance can at times be governed strictly by innate immunity under the regulation of the CD40 pathway and support the continued de - velopment of emerging therapeutic strategies that target inflammatory cells and stroma within the tumor microenvironment .

Gerlich 1 , 2 * After partitioning of cytoplasmic contents by cleavage furrow ingression , animal cells remain connected by an intercellular bridge , which subsequently splits by abscission . Here , we examined intermediate stages of abscission in human cells by using live imaging , three - dimensional structured illumination microscopy , and electron tomography . We identified helices of 17 - nanometer - diameter filaments , which narrowed the cortex of the intercellular bridge to a single stalk . The endosomal sorting complex required for transport ( ESCRT ) – III co - localized with constriction zones and was required for assembly of 17 - nanometer - diameter filaments . Simultaneous spastin - mediated removal of underlying microtubules enabled full constriction at the abscission site . The identification of contractile filament helices at the intercellular bridge has broad implications for the understanding of cell division and of ESCRT - III – mediated fission of large membrane structures . A bscission represents the very final step of cell division in animal cells whereby the two daughter cells are physically severed from one another . The mechanism of abscission is poorly understood ( 1 – 3 ) , but it may involve mechanical tearing ( 4 ) followed by plasma membrane wound healing ( 5 ) . An al - ternative model proposes that Golgi - ( 6 ) or re - cycling endosome ( 7 ) – derived vesicles establish membrane separation from within the intercel - lular bridge . To clarify which events lead to abscission , we imaged live HeLa cells stably expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein ( EGFP ) – a - tubulin ( Fig . 1 , A and B ) ( 8 ) . At the intercellular bridge , microtubule bundles gradually narrowed to a diameter of 0 . 97 T 0 . 13 m m ( mean T SD ; n = 17 cells ) and then disassembled on one side 1 Institute of Biochemistry , Department of Biology , Swiss FederalInstituteofTechnologyZurich ( ETHZ ) , Schafmattstrasse 18 , CH - 8093 Zurich , Switzerland . 2 Marine Biological Labora - tory ( MBL ) , Woods Hole , MA 02543 , USA . 3 Department of Biology , Center for Integrated Protein Science Munich , Ludwig MaximiliansUniversityMunich , GrosshadernerStrasse2 , D - 82152 Planegg - Martinsried , Germany . 4 Max Planck Institute for Mole - cularCellBiologyandGenetics , Pfotenhauerstrasse108 , D - 01307 Dresden , Germany . 5 Medical Theoretical Center , Medical Faculty CarlGustavCarus , DresdenUniversityofTechnology , Fetscherstrasse 74 , D - 01307 Dresden , Germany . * To whom correspondence should be addressed .

The first microtubule bundle disassembly occurred 49 T 10 min after complete furrow ingression , followed by dis - assembly of the second bundle ~ 20 min later . In an abscission timing assay based on cytoplasmic exchange of photoactivatable GFP ( PAGFP ) be - tween the two sister cells ( 9 ) , the complete dis - assemblyofthe firstmicrotubule bundle coincided with abscission in most cells ( 45 of 51 within a 5 - min sampling time ; Fig . 1 , C to E ) . To observe abscission , we imaged live cells until partial disassembly of microtubules at the intercellular bridge occurred , and then we chemically fixed cells for serial thin - section elec - tron microscopy . At all sites of partial micro - tubule disassembly ( n = 9 ) , the cortex of the intercellular bridge had ingressed to a narrow stalk , which contained a tightly compressed bundle of microtubules ( constriction zone in Fig . 1 , F and G , and fig . S1 ) . The constriction site cortex was deformed by regularly spaced electron - dense ripples ( Fig . 1G ) , a previously observed structural feature of intercellular bridges ( 10 ) . Ripples were absent in earlier stages ( n = 5 cells fixed < 40 min after furrow ingression ; fig . S2 ) . The constriction zone lo - calized 0 . 95 T 0 . 41 m m ( n = 19 ) from the center of the midbody . Postabscission mid - body remnants contained cytoplasmic regions of matching size ( fig . S3 ) , indicating that the constriction zone is the site of abscission . Thus , assembly of a specialized cortical structure in late - stage intercellular bridges mediates ab - scission by cortical constriction adjacent to the midbody . We did not detect vesicles at constriction zones ( Fig . 1 , F and G , and fig . S1 ) . Live - cell imaging of the secretory vesicle marker EGFP - Rab8 ( 11 ) showedthatGolgi - derivedvesiclesgradually disappeared from the intercellular bridge long before abscission ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . Disruption of the Golgi apparatus using brefeldin A ( 12 ) prevented EGFP - Rab8 targeting to the intercel - lular bridge ( fig . S4 ) but did not perturb ab - scission ( Fig . 2C ) .

Cortical constriction requires removal of un - derlying microtubules . As reported ( 13 , 14 ) , RNA interference ( RNAi ) depletion of the microtubule - severing enzyme spastin delayed ab - scission ( Fig . 2D and fig . S5 , A to C ) . However , spastin - depleted cells still contained constric - tion zones with electron - dense ripples ( Fig . 2E ; n = 7 ) . To test indirect consequences of perturbed microtubule homeostasis in spastin - depleted cells , we added the microtubule - depolymerizing com - pound T138067 ( 15 ) after furrow ingression . This led to efficient suppression of the spastin RNAi - induced abscission delay ( Fig . 2D ) . Thus , micro - tubules are not required for abscission once the intercellular bridge has formed , and their spastin - mediated disassembly is a rate - limiting step of abscission . Super - resolutionimagingwiththree - dimensional structured illumination microscopy ( 16 ) revealed that F - actin , a candidate factor for cortical con - striction , accumulated adjacent to early - stage mid - bodies ( Fig . 2F and fig . S6A ) . At later stages , however , F - actin localized only to distal ends of the intercellular bridge , and it was undetectable at constriction sites in 12 out of 14 cells ( Fig . 2G and fig . S6B ) . Depolymerization of F - actin by latrunculin B added after furrow ingression had no effect on abscission ( Fig . 2C ) . Thus , F - actin is unlikely to contribute to cortical constriction during abscission . Endosomal sorting complex required for trans - port III ( ESCRT - III ) is an attractive candidate corticalconstrictionfactor , withknownmembrane - deforming activity in reconstituted vesicle budding ( 17 – 19 ) . ESCRT - III is required for abscission , and it localizes within intercellular bridges ( 20 , 21 ) . We observed the EGFP - tagged CHMP4B core ESCRT - III subunit , stably expressed from an endogenous promotor , to be at very low levels within early - stage intercellular bridges . Then its levels increased dramatically until disassembly of the first midbody - associated microtubule bundle ( Fig . 3 , A and B , and fig . S7 , A and B ) . CHMP4B localized to two narrow cortical rings adjacent to the midbody before microtubule dis - assembly ( Fig . 3C ; 13 of 15 ) . Upon microtubule disassembly , CHMP4B and other ESCRT - III core subunits extended toward the constriction site ( six of six ; Fig . 3D and figs . S7 and S8 ) . Thus , ESCRT - III accumulates in late - stage inter - cellular bridges as a component of cortical con - striction zones . To test ESCRT - III function in cortical con - striction , we used RNAi to deplete the CHMP2A core subunit ( fig . S5 , D and E ) , and we per - formed correlative live - cell and electron micros - copy . Early midbodies ( < 40 min after furrow ingression ) of CHMP2A - depleted cells had nor - mal morphology ( fig . S5F ) . However , late - stage intercellular bridges ( > 40 min after furrow in - gression ) were always devoid of rippled constric - Fig . 2 . Abscission does not require Golgi - derived secretion or F - actin but depends on spastin - mediated microtubule disassembly .

Thus , ESCRT - III is required for cortical constriction . Microtubule depolymerization by T138067 when added after furrow ingression did not restore abscission in CHMP2A - depleted cells ( Fig . 3F ) . Thus , microtubule disassembly is not sufficient to split the intercellular bridge , suggest - ing a direct function of ESCRT - III in abscission , in addition to its known requirement for spastin targeting ( 14 ) . ESCRT - III – mediatedcorticalconstrictionneeds coordination with microtubule disassembly . Con - sistent with this , spastin was 8 . 7 T 0 . 9 times more abundant on the side of the midbody that dis - assembled microtubule bundles ( Fig . 3 , G and H ; n = 16 ) . This supports a model of spatially and temporally coordinated ESCRT - III – driven corti - cal constriction and spastin - mediated micro - tubule disassembly . ESCRT - III targeting to the intercellular bridge depends on centrosome protein 55 ( CEP55 ) and the ESCRT - related protein ALIX ( 21 – 23 ) . We found that both EGFP - tagged ALIX ( Fig . 3I , 19 of 22 ) and CEP55 ( fig . S8 , G and H ; 25 of 25 ) were confined to the midbody , whereas ESCRT - III was excluded from internal midbody regions ( Fig . 3 , C and D ) . CEP55 accumulated at the mid - body earlier than CHMP4B and ALIX ( Fig . 3B and fig . S8 , I and J ) . This indicates a mechanism of sequential targeting to the midbody periphery underlying the assembly of ESCRT - III constric - tion zones . We next performed electron tomography of high - pressure frozen HeLa cells at the abscission stage . The constriction site contained cortical fil - aments oriented perpendicular to the underlying microtubules ( Fig . 4 , A to F ) . These filaments were 17 . 3 T 2 . 5 nm ( mean T SD ; n = 60 mea - surements at five constriction zones ) wide and regularly spaced at 35 . 3 T 4 . 1 nm distances . The cortical filaments formed single or intertwined helices spanning the intercellular bridge ( Fig . 4F and fig . S9 ; n = 4 constriction zones ) . Thus , a helical filament system may generate contractile force to narrow the membrane tube of the in - tercellular bridge . Because of the known polymerization and membrane - deforming activity of ESCRT - III ( 17 , 24 – 27 ) and because of our observed colocal - ization of ESCRT - III with constriction zones , we speculate that the 17 - nm - diameter filaments may be composed of polymerized ESCRT - III core com - ponents . Supporting this idea , the 17 - nm - diameter filaments did not occur in intercellular bridges of high - pressure frozen CHMP2A RNAi cells ( n = 7 late - stage intercellular bridges ; fig . S10 ) . In contrast , spastin RNAi did not perturb 17 - nm filaments ( fig . S11 ) .
