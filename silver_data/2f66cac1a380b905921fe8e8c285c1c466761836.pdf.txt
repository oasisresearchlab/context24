Penicillin - binding protein 4 ( PBP4 ) is a nonessential transpeptidase , required for the high levels of peptidoglycan crosslinking characteristic of S . aureus . Importantly , this protein is essential for b - lactam resistance in community - acquired , methicillin - resis - tant S . aureus ( MRSA ) strains but not in hospital - acquired MRSA strains . Using AFM in a new mode for recording force / distance curves , we observed that the absence of PBP4 , and the concomitant reduction of the peptidoglycan crosslinking , resulted in a reduction in stiffness of the S . aureus cell wall . Importantly , the reduction in cell wall stiffness in the absence of PBP4 was observed both in community - acquired and hospital - acquired MRSA strains , indicating that high levels of peptidoglycan cross - linking modulate the overall structure and mechanical properties of the S . aureus cell envelope in both types of clinically relevant strains . Additionally , we were able to show that the applied method enables the separation of cell wall properties and turgor pressure . INTRODUCTION The cell wall is critical for cell survival in most bacteria ; it functions as a protection against mechanical and osmotic lysis in addition to maintaining cell shape ( 1 ) . Furthermore , the cell wall controls the tactile response of bacteria , inﬂu - encing a wide range of behaviors such as cell adhesion , environmental sensing , or host defense evasion ( 2 – 4 ) . The major component of the cell wall is peptidoglycan , a com - plex polymer composed of long glycan chains of alternating b - 1 , 4 - linked n - acetylglucosamine and n - acetylmuramic acid subunits , which are cross - linked via peptide bridges to form a strong but ﬂexible structure ( 5 , 6 ) . The last stages of peptidoglycan biosynthesis are catalyzed by a group of proteins called penicillin - binding proteins ( PBPs ) , which have both transglycosylase and transpeptidase activities , required for the elongation of the glycan chains and the formation of peptide bonds , respectively ( 7 ) . As the name suggests , PBPs are the target of b - lactam antibiotics , mole - cules that block the transpeptidase active site . Bacterial pathogens have developed different mechanisms to resist the action of b - lactams , mainly by destroying the antibiotic molecule through the action of b - lactamases , or by modi - fying its target , i . e . , the PBPs . Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram - positive clinical path - ogen that has developed a remarkable ability to resist the action of virtually all b - lactam antibiotics . Methicillin - resis - tant S . aureus ( MRSA ) strains are currently one of the major causes of antibiotic - resistant , hospital - acquired infections , and can also cause infections among healthy individuals in the community . Therefore , the study of the S . aureus cell envelope is of particular importance for the develop - ment of new strategies for antimicrobial chemotherapy ( 8 ) . The cell wall of S . aureus contains not only a thick layer of peptidoglycan ( ~ 20 nm ) , but also other polymers like the anionic wall teichoic acids and lipoteichoic acids , second - ary modiﬁcations , and several proteins attached to the peptidoglycan , resulting in a structure with a total width of ~ 35 nm ( 3 , 9 , 10 ) . Studies over the last decades have focused on the biochemistry of peptidoglycan biosynthesis and most steps in this pathway are now well characterized ( 6 , 11 ) . However , much less is known about the three - dimen - sional architecture and mechanical properties of this com - plex polymer . We are interested in studying the mechanical properties of the peptidoglycan of live S . aureus cells and in identi - fying key enzymes essential for the ﬁnal structure of this polymer . One of the characteristics of the staphylococcal peptidoglycan is its very high degree of crosslinking , inasmuch as up to 90 % of its muropeptides are linked to adjacent glycan chains in the peptidoglycan mesh .

(cid:1) 2014 by the Biophysical Society 0006 - 3495 / 14 / 09 / 1082 / 8 $ 2 . 00 http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . bpj . 2014 . 07 . 029 1082 Biophysical Journal Volume 107 September 2014 1082 – 1089 crosslinking can be classiﬁed into one of the two following types : 1 . Primary crosslinking , which is responsible for the ﬁrst level of cross - links between different glycan chains . Such links are necessary in most bacteria to preserve cell integrity , and include muropeptide species with a poly - merization degree lower than or equal to pentamers ( 6 ) . 2 . Secondary crosslinking , which is the result of the same transpeptidase chemical reaction as in the primary cross - linking , but leads to higher levels of linkage of the peptidoglycan layers . It includes muropeptide species with a polymerization degree higher than pentamers ( 6 ) . According to the literature , secondary crosslinking is mainly the result of the action of S . aureus PBP4 , a nonessential transpeptidase ( 12 , 13 ) . We therefore hypothesized that PBP4 could have a major role in deﬁning the local mechan - ical properties of S . aureus peptidoglycan , a hypothesis that is backed by results on global mechanical properties of the S . aureus cell wall ( 14 ) . Interestingly , although it is not essential for normal cell growth , PBP4 has been associated with resistance mechanisms against two major classes of antibiotics : 1 . Glycopeptides , where the absence of PBP4 was associ - ated with low - level resistance in vancomycin intermedi - ate S . aureus strains ( 15 ) ; and 2 . b - lactams , with PBP4 being required for expression of high level b - lactam resistance in community - acquired MRSA ( CA - MRSA ) strains but not in hospital - acquired ( HA - MRSA ) strains ( 16 ) . In recent years , atomic - force microscopy ( AFM ) has provided valuable information on the structural , adhesive , and mechanical properties of the cell wall in numerous biological samples ( 17 – 24 ) . AFM can be used not only to obtain topological information on the cell surface and the organization of the peptidoglycan ( 20 , 22 , 24 – 26 ) , but it is also a powerful tool for quantitative studies of physical properties of the surface , such as the elasticity of the bacte - rial cell wall ( 27 – 34 ) . To characterize the mechanical prop - erties of the bacterial cell wall , either puriﬁed peptidoglycan or live , intact bacteria can be employed . Both approaches have different limitations but should yield to similar results . Classical AFM modes , such as tapping or force volume mode , are limited in terms of either spatial resolution , imag - ing time , or quantitative analysis . The recently introduced PeakForce Tapping ( Bruker , Santa Barbara , CA ) mode with its quantitative nanomechanical property mapping ( PeakForce QNM ; Bruker ) , however , allows for simulta - neous mapping of topography and multiple mechanical properties , featuring the typical spatial resolution and scan speed of the tapping mode ( 35 – 37 ) . In this work , we employed this AFM mode with viable , genetically deﬁned prototypes of HA - and CA - MRSA and methicillin - susceptible S . aureus ( MSSA ) strains and their pbp4 mutants to investigate whether the absence of PBP4 and the concomitant decrease in peptidoglycan crosslinking has an effect on the overall structure and mechanical prop - erties of the S . aureus cell wall . Because pbp4 deletion has different effects on the b - lactam resistance of HA - and CA - MRSA , we studied two S . aureus strains , COL ( HA - MRSA strain ) and MW2 ( CA - MRSA strain ) , as well as their respective pbp4 deletion mutants . METHODS S . aureus strains and growth conditions S . aureus strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 . S . aureus strains were grown on tryptic soy agar ( TSA ; Difco Laboratories , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) at 37 (cid:1) C or in tryptic soy broth ( TSB ; Difco Laboratories ) at 37 (cid:1) C with aeration . The medium was supplemented , when necessary , with 50 m g / mL of Kanamycin and 50 m g / mL of Neomycin ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) . Construction of S . aureus strains For localization studies of PBP4 in HA - MRSA and CA - MRSA back - grounds , the gene encoding a PBP4 - YFP fusion was transduced , using phage 80 a , from strain RNPBP4YFP ( 38 ) into MW2 and COL strains , as previously described in Veiga and Pinho ( 39 ) . Fluorescence microscopy S . aureus strains were grown to midexponential phase , placed on a thin layer of 1 % agarose in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ; 137 mM NaCl , 10 mM phosphate , and 2 . 7 mM KCl , pH 7 . 4 ) and analyzed by ﬂuorescence microscopy . Images were acquired using a Carl Zeiss Z1 microscope with Axio Observer ( Carl Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) and a PhotoMetrics CoolSNAP HQ2 camera ( Roper Scientiﬁc ; Planegg , Germany ) , and the software METAMORPH ( Ver . 7 . 5 ; Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) . Peptidoglycan puriﬁcation and HPLC analysis Peptidoglycan was prepared from exponentially growing cultures of COL and MW2 parental strains and corresponding pbp4 deletion mutants , as TABLE 1 S . aureus strains used in this study S . aureus strain Relevant characteristics MIC ( 16 ) Origin COL HA - MRSA strain , wt 256 mg / L ( 51 ) COL D pbp4 HA - MRSA strain ; pbp4 null mutant 256 mg / L ( 16 ) MW2 CA - MRSA strain , wt 64 mg / L ( 52 ) MW2 D pbp4 CA - MRSA strain ; pbp4 null mutant 4 mg / L ( 16 ) 8325 - 4 MSSA strain , wt — R .

( 40 ) . Muropeptides were obtained from puriﬁed peptidoglycan digested with the muramidase mutanolysin M1 ( Sigma ) , an n - acetylmuramidase that cuts glycan strands between the n - acetylmuramic and n - acetylglucosamine residues of both O - acetylated and unmodiﬁed peptidoglycan , as previously described in Filipe et al . ( 40 ) . The resulting muropeptides were reduced with sodium borohydride ( Sigma ) and analyzed by reversed - phase HPLC using a HypersilODS col - umn ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc , Waltham , MA ) . The eluted muropeptides were detected and quantiﬁed by determination of their UV absorption at 206 nm , using the software LC SOLUTION ( Shimadzu , Kyoto , Japan ) . AFM elasticity mapping For AFM experiments , S . aureus strains were grown in 12 mL of TSB at 37 (cid:1) C with aeration until midexponential phase ( optical density OD 600nm ¼ 0 . 6 ) . Cells were harvested and concentrated in one - third of the initial vol - ume in fresh media . After concentration , the cell suspension was gently ﬁltered , so that cells were immobilized by mechanical trapping into porous polycarbonate membranes with a pore size of 1 . 2 m m ( Millipore , Billerica , MA ) ( 41 ) . The ﬁlter was gently rinsed with PBS , the excess of cells was removed by gently cleaning with powder free tissue , and the ﬁlter was inverted and attached to a glass slide with double - face adhesive tape . A silicone cover was used to create a hydrophobic area around the ﬁlter , which was then ﬁlled with 1 : 10 TSB / PBS solution . AFM measurements were performed in the TSB / PBS solution at room temperature using a Bioscope Catalyst ( Bruker ) in PeakForce QNM ( Bruker ) mode ( 36 , 37 ) . The bacterial samples were freshly prepared for each series of measure - ments and characterized usually within 30 min and never later than 2 h after harvesting . The viability of the bacteria was conﬁrmed by live / dead staining , stamping of ﬁlters on agar plates , and by the observation of cell division of the trapped bacteria . Immediately before each experiment , the AFM probes ( Scanasyst - Fluid þ ; Bruker ) were calibrated . Single AFM measurements were carried out with a line scan rate of 0 . 5 Hz , amplitude of 100 – 200 nm , a gain of 0 . 1 , a force - curve frequency of 1 kHz , and a peak force threshold of 1 nN ( unless mentioned otherwise ) . The spring constant of the cantilever was determined by the thermal tune method ( 42 ) and the optical lever sensitivity by pushing the cantilever against a hard surface before the exper - iments . Elastic moduli were obtained by a Derjaguin - Muller - Toporov ( DMT ) ﬁt ( 43 , 44 ) of the retract part of each single force / distance curve ( Fig . 1 ) described by F (cid:3) F Adh ¼ 4 3 E ð 1 (cid:3) n 2 Þ ﬃﬃﬃ R p ð d (cid:3) d 0 Þ 32 ; where F (cid:3) F Adh is the determined force relative to the adhesion force , n is the Poisson ratio ( for bacteria usually 0 . 5 ( 29 , 33 ) ) , R is the tip - radius ( z 10 nm ) , d – d 0 is the deformation of the sample , and E is the elastic modulus . The determination of absolute values for elastic moduli of soft materials at a microscopic scale is not straightforward ( 45 ) . This holds especially true for biological systems . Thus , the DMT model also does not perfectly repre - sent the complex bacterial cell wall . It is , however , a valid assumption as discussed below , speciﬁcally because we are focusing on relative differ - ences between different bacteria with the same experimental setups . The DMT approach assumes a spherical object indenting in the ﬂat surface of an elastic half - space , which is a safe approximation due to the difference of more than two magnitudes in curvatures of a bacterium compared to the AFM tip as well as due to the small indentations . To avoid artifacts due to topography and different angles of indentation , only the topmost part ( ~ 300 (cid:4) 300 nm 2 ) of each bacterium was taken into account . Effects of local small - scale curvature and inhomogeneities in cell wall composition lead to variability in the acquired data . To overcome these effects , we char - acterized the entire upper part of the bacteria and collected a large set of datapoints . A total of 50 , 000 – 150 , 000 single elasticity values were obtained from measurements on 10 – 25 single bacteria per strain . Multiple experi - ments using different bacterial cultures and AFM probes were performed for each strain . RESULTS Although the S . aureus cell wall is a complex heterogeneous structure composed of several polymers and proteins ( 3 , 10 ) , it is its main component , the peptidoglycan , that is thought to provide rigidity to bacterial cells , crucial for the cell to withstand the high internal osmotic pressure ( 20 – 30 bar ) ( 6 , 9 ) . As stated above , PBP4 is responsible for the second - ary crosslinking of the S . aureus peptidoglycan ( 6 ) . Thus , we used PBP4 mutants to test whether highly cross - linked peptidoglycan was required for increased mechanical resistance of live S . aureus cells . For this purpose , we used AFM in PeakForce QNM , a method that detects material variations ( such as elasticity or adhesion ) at high resolution across a simultaneously acquired topographic image ( 35 – 37 ) . To access primarily the cell wall properties , we used experimental conditions in which the cantilever FIGURE 1 Example of a force / distance curve , which allows insight into local adhesion and elasticity of the sample . ( A ) Schematic force / distance curve : The maximum adhesion force between the tip and the sample can be extracted as the step height between the base line and the pull - off point . The peak force is deﬁned as the vertical distance between the base line and the point of maximum indentation . By analyzing the retraction phase of each single force / distance curve , the elastic modulus can be determined using a DMT ﬁt ( 43 , 44 ) ( adapted from Pittenger et al . ( 53 ) ) .

Using this method - ology , we mapped the elasticity proﬁles of the cell envelope of two MRSA strains , the HA - MRSA COL and the CA - MRSA MW2 , as well as of the respective pbp4 mutants COL D pbp4 and MW2 D pbp4 . Live cells of these strains were immobilized in porous membranes ( Fig . 2 ) , and elastic moduli were then determined on individual cells and map - ped onto the height image . Only the top of each bacterium was analyzed to avoid additional inﬂuence of a change in topography . The ﬁrst conclusion is that there are no patches of specif - ically high or low elasticity on a single bacterium . This ﬁnding is a consequence of our experimental setting , which is designed to analyze solely the mature cell wall and not the septal cell wall undergoing division . The second and main conclusion of the AFM mea - surements relates to the signiﬁcant reduction in the elastic modulus of the cell wall in both CA - MRSA and HA - MRSA strains lacking PBP4 , compared to the parental strains ( Fig . 3 ) . Because elastic modulus is lower for mate - rial with greater elasticity , this data suggests that a decrease in secondary crosslinking results in increased cell wall elasticity ( or , in other words , reduced cell wall stiffness ) both in COL and in MW2 backgrounds . This is consistent with the hypothesis that a reduction of the number of bonds linking adjacent glycan chains results in a more pliable cell - wall / peptidoglycan structure . Accordingly , when Fran - cius et al . ( 30 ) used AFM to study the effect of lysostaphin in live S . aureus cells , they observed a 9 . 3 - fold decrease in cell wall stiffness of lysostaphin - treated cells . Lysostaphin cleaves all pentaglycine bridges that cross - link S . aureus peptidoglycan , effectively destroying both primary and sec - ondary peptidoglycan crosslinking ( 30 ) . As seen in Fig . 4 C , the pbp4 deletion mutants show a reduction in the levels of secondary crosslinking , but maintain peptidoglycan primary crosslinking , due to the action of the other PBPs present in the cell , which justiﬁes the fact that we observed a smaller decrease in cell wall stiffness ( 4 . 4 - and 1 . 5 - fold for MW2 and COL , respectively ) compared to the action of lysosta - phin . However , we cannot formally exclude the possibility that the alterations in cell wall stiffness are due to additional changes in the cell wall surface ( in addition to secondary crosslinking reduction ) that might result from the absence of PBP4 . Yet , we can exclude the possibility that the observed reduction in the elastic modulus is due to changes in turgor pressure . To conﬁrm this , we additionally performed exper - iments using a higher peak force threshold of 5 nN resulting in larger indentations . As shown in Fig . 5 A , the reduction in elastic modulus observed at low indentations diminishes at larger indentations . On the other hand , increasing the NaCl concentration from 0 . 15 to 1 . 5 mol / L has no effect on the measured modulus at small indentations ( Fig . 5 B ) . The experiments with larger indentations , however , reveal the induced decrease in cell turgor due to the higher osmotic concentration . Together , these results highlight the potential of the used method to probe different cell properties by choosing different peak force thresholds . A possible source of variation of peptidoglycan stiffness between cells could result from measurements being taken at locations with recently synthesized peptidoglycan as well as locations with mature peptidoglycan , i . e . , peptido - glycan that underwent secondary crosslinking by PBP4 . This was unlikely , given that in previously reported S . aureus strains PBP4 localized ( and presumably acted ) speciﬁcally at the division septum ( 38 ) . To conﬁrm that this was also the case in the strains used in this study , we FIGURE 2 Height images overlaid with the distribution map of the elastic modulus values of ( A ) COL , ( B ) COL D pbp4 , ( C ) MW2 , ( D ) MW2 D pbp4 , ( E ) 8325 - 4 , and ( F ) 8325 - 4 D pbp4 single cells trapped in a membrane pore , and respective two - dimensional , top - down representations of the analyzed part of the elastic moduli ( scale bars 50 nm ) . To avoid artifacts due to topography , only the topmost part ( ~ 300 (cid:4) 300 nm 2 ) of each bacterium was analyzed . The stiffness of the cell wall of the D pbp4 mutant is signiﬁcantly decreased in comparison with the wt strain . To see this ﬁgure in color , go online . Biophysical Journal 107 ( 5 ) 1082 – 1089 Stiffness of the S . aureus Cell Envelope 1085 characterized the localization of PBP4 fused to yellow ﬂuo - rescent protein ( YFP ) , expressed from its native chromo - somal locus , in strains COL and MW2 . In both strains , ﬂuorescence microscopy results clearly attribute the YFP signal to the septal ring ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) , indicating that FIGURE 3 Elastic modulus is reduced upon a reduction of secondary crosslinking . ( A and B ) Histograms with all the single values from each force curve obtained from all bacteria analyzed . ( A ) This shows that the surface of the COL D pbp4 mutant is more elastic than that of the COL wt strain . Approximately 50 , 000 single elasticity values were ob - tained from measurements on 11 – 13 single cells per strain . ( B ) Similarly , the MW2 wt strain is less elastic than the MW2 D pbp4 strain . Approxi - mately 70 , 000 – 130 , 000 single elasticity values were obtained from mea - surements on 11 – 24 single bacteria per strain .

Microscopy images of ( A ) MW2pPBP4 - YFP and ( B ) COLpPBP4 - YFP strains , expressing a C - terminal YFP fusion to PBP4 from its native chromosomal locus and under the control of its native promoter , show that PBP4 is recruited to the division septa in these MRSA strains . The protein can be seen as a line corresponding to a septum perpendicular to the plane of the slide , or as a ring when the septum is forming at different angles relative to the plane of the slide ( scale bar : 1 m m ) .

Biophysical Journal 107 ( 5 ) 1082 – 1089 1086 Loskill et al . immature peptidoglycan is only present at that place , and not in the cell surface that was analyzed by AFM . Interestingly , although peptidoglycan is not a rigid struc - ture and can withstand severe changes without compro - mising the overall cell envelope integrity ( 9 , 46 ) , our data also suggest that there is a lack of a compensatory mecha - nism able to maintain the overall stiffness of the cell wall in the absence of PBP4 . DISCUSSION The aim of this work was to study the change of the elastic - ity of the peptidoglycan of live S . aureus cells upon reduc - tion of secondary peptidoglycan crosslinking that results from pbp4 deletion and to compare the effect on HA - and CA - MRSA . By employing AFM PeakForce QNM ( Bruker ) with viable , genetically deﬁned prototypes of HA - and CA - MRSA strains and with their pbp4 mutants , we showed that the absence of PBP4 and the concomitant decrease in pepti - doglycan crosslinking has an effect on the overall structure and local elasticity of the S . aureus cell wall . These ﬁndings are in line with previous reports on a further , more global aspect of the mechanical properties of the cell wall of different S . aureus strains , which showed an effect on the global deformability by pressing entire bacteria against ﬂat surfaces ( 14 ) . Given that deletion of pbp4 results in a strong decrease of b - lactam resistance in CA - MRSA strains , such as MW2 ( Oxacillin minimum inhibitory concentrations ( MICs ) for wild - type ( wt ) , 64 g / mL , and pbp4 mutant , 4 g / mL ) , but not in HA - MRSA backgrounds , such as COL ( Oxacillin MICs for wt and pbp4 mutant , 256 g / mL ) , we tested whether a lack of PBP4 has more inﬂuence on the structure of the cell surface of MW2 than of COL . The stiffness decreasing effect was observed both in HA - and CA - MRSA . The extent of the effect as well as the absolute values , however , are different for HA - and CA - MRSA , indicating that a correlation might exist between the requirement of PBP4 for b - lactam resistance—as solely observed in CA - MRSA—and the mechanical properties of the pep - tidoglycan . Because the mechanical properties of the cell wall play an important role in bacteria / surface inter - actions , a correlation with bacterial adhesion forces is also conceivable ( 47 ) . The AFM elasticity measurements can be correlated with the cell wall structure of the S . aureus CA - MRSA and HA - MRSA strains , by comparing them to the HPLC analysis of puriﬁed peptidoglycan from parental strains COL and MW2 and their respective pbp4 deletion mutants . As previously shown , pbp4 gene deletion results in signiﬁcant decrease of the highly cross - linked muropeptide species that typically elute as a broad peak at the end of the HPLC chromatogram ( Fig . 4 C , arrow ) ( 16 ) . We therefore used these isogenic pairs of bacterial strains differing in the peptidoglycan crosslinking degree for AFM analysis . In general , a variation in studies of peptidoglycan elastic - ity may result from obtaining measurements on newly syn - thesized cell wall as well as on mature cell wall , which may have different levels of crosslinking . In the rod - shaped , Gram - positive model organism Bacillus subtilis , cell wall synthesis occurs both at the septum , for cell division , and at the lateral wall , for cell elongation ( 6 , 7 ) . Although the septum of live cells is not accessible to the AFM cantilever before separation of daughter cells , in B . subtilis measure - ments made at the lateral wall ( side of the cylindrical cell ) would include the mature peptidoglycan as well as helical bands of newly synthesized peptidoglycan ( 48 ) . The use of S . aureus as a model organism avoids this source of vari - ation in peptidoglycan composition , inasmuch as round S . aureus cells do not elongate and therefore only synthesize cell wall at the division septum . Moreover , we were able to FIGURE 5 By separately changing the peak force threshold and the salt concentration , different cell properties can be probed .

Hence , elasticity measurements in S . aureus cell surfaces reﬂect the structure of the mature cell wall , distant from the sites of PBPs localization , and therefore the sites of synthesis of new peptidoglycan . Importantly , PBP4 localization was identical in CA - MRSA and HA - MRSA backgrounds , despite its role in these different backgrounds of b - lactam resistance . After cell separation , the mature septum of S . aureus becomes one hemisphere of each daughter cell ( 49 ) . Therefore , in this organism , the entire cell surface should correspond to mature peptidoglycan of different ages with the possible exception of a single band around the division site corre - sponding to the outer edge of the septum , identiﬁed on the AFM height images of dividing S . aureus cells ( 30 , 50 ) . Thus , our experimental setup enables us to map the elastic - ity of mature cell wall to assess the effect of the reduction of secondary crosslinking on the mechanical properties of the S . aureus cell wall . CONCLUSION We have demonstrated that alterations in the secondary peptidoglycan crosslinking , caused by a lack of the nones - sential transpeptidase PBP4 , trigger changes in the local me - chanical properties of the S . aureus cell wall , enhancing the overall elasticity of staphylococcal cells both in HA and CA - MRSA strains . Interestingly , we observed a stronger effect of the reduction of the secondary crosslinking on the mechanical properties of the cell wall in CA - MRSA strain MW2 ( which requires PBP4 for b - lactam resistance ) than in HA - MRSA strain COL . These results were obtained by imaging live S . aureus cells and mapping the local cell - wall elasticity of single cells with high spatial resolution using AFM in the recently introduced PeakForce Tapping ( Bruker ) mode . This mode allows to probe cell wall elastic - ity and turgor separately , depending on the chosen ex - perimental parameters . The differences in the effect in the MRSA strains highlight the necessity to investigate the role that mechanical properties play in the context of b - lactam resistance .
