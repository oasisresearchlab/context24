Scientists are measured by their publications . Yet anonymous peer review is far from transparent . Does bias lurk within the refereeing process ? Investigating the outcomes of manuscript submissions suggests that the overall process is not sexist , but differences in acceptance rates across journals according to gender of the first author give grounds for caution . Manuscripts with more authors and by native English speakers are more successful ; whether this is due to bias remains to be seen . Published online : 06 June 2002 Senior academics in the field of ecology and evolution are predominantly male , in spite of a gender ratio that is closer to parity among younger researchers . Clearly , this pattern is the result of a combination of factors , but a pressing question is whether gender bias is involved . Studies of grant awards [ 1 ] , promotions [ 2 ] and resource allocation [ 3 ] illustrate the potential for sexual discrimination in the allocation of funding . Potentially equally important , but less scrutinized , is the process by which decisions on the publication of manuscripts are made by referees and journal editors . With the help of the editorial staff of several high impact ( ISI impact factor > 2 ) ecology and evolution primary research journals , I have examined differences in acceptance rate according to gender , nationality and the number of authors on a manuscript . The study I wrote to the editors of 24 primary research journals requesting that they record the gender , nationality , number of authors and the final decision made on their submitted manuscripts over a period of a year . Seven editors from five journals agreed to take part providing data from 2680 manuscripts on the number of authors , the gender of the first author , their country affiliation , and whether the manuscript was finally accepted or rejected . Gender was designated as unknown where it was not immediately apparent from the author’s first name ( predominantly when only initials were provided ) even if the editor actually knew the person’s gender . There does not appear to be any gender difference in likelihood of choosing to use initials rather than first names ( Box 1 ) . Data were collected within the period 1997 to 2000 . Of 2680 manuscripts , 1558 had male first authors , 498 female , and 624 unknown gender , ( χ 2 = 751 , P < 0 . 001 ) . There was no difference in the proportion of manuscripts each gender submitted as a sole author ( excluding unknown gender manuscripts ) ( n = 2056 , χ 2 = 2 . 45 , P = 0 . 12 ) . Effect of author gender Combining data from all journals ( n = 2550 excluding those pending a decision ) , there is no overall difference in the acceptance rates of papers according to gender ( χ 2 = 4 . 04 , P = 0 . 13 ) ( Fig . 1 ) . This pattern is the same if only single author papers are considered ( n = 554 , χ 2 = 1 . 97 , P = 0 . 37 ) . Had there been a difference in acceptance rate relative to gender it would Gender bias in the refereeing process ?

PII : S0169 - 5347 ( 02 ) 02545 - 4 349 Research Update In November 2001 , I examined the citation rate of 507 papers published 3 – 4 years previously in five leading ecology and evolution journals that generally publish authors’ first names , allowing gender to be determined in most cases . Female authors do not appear more likely to use initials rather than their names : of papers where authors used initials , web searches and correspondence with co - authors revealed that 12 out of 38 were female ( 2 way χ 2 = 2 . 78 , P = 0 . 1 ) . The number of citations for each paper was determined from the ISI citation index . There were no differences in citation rate according to gender , ( Kruskal Wallis ; χ 2 = 3 . 02 , P = 0 . 22 ) as would be expected if the reviewing process and citation are unbiased in relation to gender . However , there were differences in citation rate between papers according to the number of authors , with twoauthor papers most cited and a linear decline in citation rate through 3 , 1 and 4 + authors ( KruskalWallis ; χ 2 = 8 . 26 , P = 0 . 041 ) . Hence , although submissions with more than four authors are the most likely to be accepted , they are the least likely to be cited . Country of affiliation of the first author has a strong effect on number of citations , even if only wealthy countries are used ( see main text ) , with papers from non - native English speaking countries attracting fewer citations ( Kruskal Wallis ; χ 2 = 9 . 17 , P = 0 . 002 ) .

Acceptance of manuscripts according to gender of first author . There is no overall difference in the acceptance rate of manuscripts according to whether the first author is designated as male , female or unknown . ( Open bars , accepted manuscripts ; blue bars , rejected manuscripts ) . be difficult to determine whether this was due to bias in the review process or differences in the quality of papers submitted by authors of different genders . However , one prediction that can be made is that there ought to be a consistent pattern of manuscript acceptance or rejection relative to gender across journals in the same field . I have examined the pattern of acceptance and rejection relative to author gender in each journal separately . Table 1 shows that acceptance rates do not differ relative to gender except in editor 7 , where manuscripts by men have significantly higher frequency of publication than those in the other gender groups . This result remains significant at the 0 . 05 level after Bonferroni adjustment , but is not significant if the unknown gender class is ignored . These data can be analysed using a loglinear modelling approach starting with a model with the factors : editor ( 1 – 7 ) ; author gender ( male , female , unknown ) and result ( accept , reject ) . This analysis fails to reject the null hypothesis that there is no significant interaction between journal and author gender in their effect on whether manuscripts are accepted for publication ( Likelihood ratio χ 2 = 18 . 39 , P = 0 . 104 ) . Hence , although the analysis in Table 1 suggests there are differences among journals in success of authors of different gender , this is not borne out by a more rigorous and conservative approach . Effect of number of authors There is a strong effect of number of authors on acceptance rates ( using author categories 1 , 2 , 3 and > 4 , χ 2 = 13 . 5 , P = 0 . 004 ) . Single authors are most likely to have their submissions rejected and manuscripts with more than four authors are more likely to be accepted ( Fig . 2 ) . This could reflect differences in quality of submitted manuscripts , or may be due to other factors such as an increased chance of a relationship with potential referees where there are more authors . Interestingly , the pattern of citation rates relative to author number ( Box 1 ) is almost the opposite of the pattern of acceptance rates . Effect of country of affiliation of first author Manuscripts were submitted from 62 different countries . Countries were classified as high or low income , as defined by the World Bank [ 4 ] , their criteria being a GDPof > US $ 9625 per person , and according to whether English is a national language . I have used three mutually exclusive categories : 1 = high income , native English speaking ; 2 = high income , non - native English speaking ; and 3 = low income , ( 76 % of manuscripts from which were non - English speaking ) . There is a strong effect of country of affiliation on manuscript acceptance ( χ 2 = 35 . 0 , d . f . = 2 , P < 0 . 001 ) . If only wealthy nations are included , there remains a strong difference , with 41 % of papers from English speaking nations ( Australia , Canada , NZ , UK and USA ) being accepted compared to only 33 % from non - English speaking nations ( EU countries , Israel , Japan , Norway and Switzerland ) ( χ 2 = 14 . 6 , d . f . = 1 , P < 0 . 001 ) . Discussion This study suggests that the reviewing process for manuscripts is not ‘institutionally sexist’ : there are no overall differences in manuscript acceptance or citation rate relative to gender . However , differences among journals in the acceptance rate of papers relative to gender gives grounds for caution because this pattern is difficult to explain without invoking bias . Additionally , most editors approached refused to take part , creating the possibility that the seven out of 24 editors that did agree to being studied are unusually aware of the potential for bias . Patterns of acceptance relative to the country of author affiliation are intriguing and might indicate that non - English speaking nations are at a disadvantage either as a result of discrimination or perhaps because of the additional burden of having to write in a foreign language . Previous studies have indicated that reviewers might favour manuscripts from their compatriots [ 5 ] , and that reviewer gender has an effect on acceptance rates relative to author gender [ 6 ] . The present study suggests that the field of ecology and evolution might not be immune from such issues . Acknowledgements This study was conducted jointly with seven journal editors . T .
