LRRK2 : Function and Dysfunction 1095 Human leucine - rich repeat kinase 1 and 2 : intersecting or unrelated functions ? Laura Civiero and Luigi Bubacco 1 Department of Biology , University of Padova , Via Ugo Bassi 58 / b , 35121 , Padua , Italy Abstract Mutations in LRRK2 ( leucine - rich repeat kinase 2 ) are associated with both familial and sporadic PD ( Parkinson’s disease ) . LRRK1 ( leucine - rich repeat kinase 1 ) shares a similar domain structure with LRRK2 , but it is not linked to PD . LRRK proteins belong to a gene family known as ROCO , which codes for large proteins with several domains . All ROCO proteins have a ROC ( Ras of complex proteins ) GTPase domain followed by a domain of unknown function [ COR ( C - terminal of ROC ) ] . LRRK2 , LRRK1 and other ROCO proteins also possess a kinase domain . To date , the function of LRRK1 and both the physiological and the pathological roles of LRRK2 are only beginning to unfold . The comparative analysis of these two proteins is a strategy to single out the speciﬁc properties of LRRKs to understand their cellular physiology . This comparison is the starting point to unravel the pathways that may lead to PD and eventually to develop therapeutic strategies for its treatment . In the present review , we discuss recently published results on LRRK2 and its paralogue LRRK1 concerning their evolutionary signiﬁcance , biochemical properties and potential functional roles . Introduction PD ( Parkinson’s disease ) is a neurodegenerative disorder with no cure . Mutations in LRRK2 ( leucine - rich repeat kinase 2 ) are the most common genetic causes of both familial late - onset parkinsonism and apparently sporadic PD [ 1 , 2 ] . To date , five amino acid substitutions in LRRK2 have been identified as pathogenic ( R1441G / C , Y1699C , G2019S and I2020T ) [ 3 ] . In certain populations , the LRRK2 G2019S mutation is found in up to 40 % of PD patients [ 4 ] . The LRRK2 gene encodes a large multidomain protein characterized by the presence of leucine - rich repeats and two enzymatic units : a GTPase domain similar to Ras small GTPases and a kinase domain , belonging to the TKL ( tyrosine kinase - like ) kinases , which shows high similarity to MLKs ( mixed - lineage kinases ) [ 5 – 7 ] . In vertebrates , the LRRK2 gene has one paralogue : LRRK1 ( leucine - rich repeat kinase 1 ) . The two proteins display a conserved domain architecture [ 8 , 9 ] and are both members of the ROCO family [ 10 ] . Moreover , both proteins are expressed in the brain [ 8 , 11 , 12 ] and are basally phosphorylated [ 11 ] . However , despite their close homology and their similar expression profile , no mutations in LRRK1 have been genetically associated with PD [ 8 ] . Interestingly , it was shown that mutations in LRRK1 mimicking LRRK2 pathological mutations are less toxic than pathogenic mutations in LRRK2 Keywords : leucine - richrepeatkinase1 ( LRRK1 ) , leucine - richrepeatkinase2 ( LRRK2 ) , Parkinson’s disease .

In the present paper , we review the available structural , biochemical and functional data on LRRK1 and LRRK2 , and attempt to link them to specific biological pathways . Evolutionary and structural considerations Discovered in the 1990s [ 13 , 14 ] , ROCO proteins were formally described and named by Bosgraaf and Van Haastert in 2003 [ 10 ] . This group of proteins contains two conserved domains named ROC ( Ras of complex proteins ) , a GTPase domain with high sequence similarity to Ras and other related small GTPases , and COR ( C - terminal of ROC ) , a domain of unknown function , but a fingerprint of all ROCO proteins . The presence of this characteristic ROC – COR domain made it possible to trace its evolution and the functional correlation among the members of this family [ 15 ] . Bioinformatics studies revealed that ROCO genes are present both in prokaryotes and eukaryotes [ 10 ] . The first ROCO protein was discovered in the slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum where 11 ROCO genes were found . Mammals contain four ROCO genes : LRRK1 , LRRK2 , DAPK1 ( death - associated kinase 1 ) and MFHAS1 ( malignant fibrous histiocytoma amplified sequence 1 ) . In animals , the evolution of LRRK proteins is particularly interesting . On the basis of bioinformatics analysis of the LRRK ROC and COR domains , Marin [ 7 ] proposed a phylogenetic reconstruction tracking the origin of the LRRK genes . He suggests that two independent events of gene duplication from an ancestral protogene termed ‘proto - LRRK ’ led to three LRRK genes . In cnidarians , an additional gene duplication event yielded a fourth LRRK gene . Conversely , protostomes such as Drosophila melanogaster or Caenorhabditis elegans have lost LRRK1 and LRRK2 and Biochem . Soc . Trans .

This is particularly interesting in that Drosophila and , in part , Caenorhabditis have been largely used to investigate LRRK2 pathophysiology [ 17 ] . Given that pLRRK3 appears to be evolutionarily different from dLRRK2 , this suggests that caution should be taken when translating dLrrk ( Drosophila LRRK ) function to human LRRK2 function . Of note , published studies show that overexpression of dLrrk or LRRK2 mutants on fruitfly models , as well as dLrrk depletion , causes selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and motor function deficits [ 18 – 20 ] . It was also demonstratedthatbothdLrrkandLRRK2canphosphorylate the 4E - BP1 ( eukaryotic initiation factor 4E - binding protein 1 ) [ 19 ] . These results suggest that these two proteins are likely to possess a conserved function . LRRK1 and LRRK2 share a similar domain organization ( Figure 1 ) , which includes the presence of leucine - rich and ankyrin - like repeats at the N - terminus and a ROC – COR domain followed by a serine / threonine kinase domain ( ROC – COR – kinase module ) . Among mammalian ROCO proteins , the kinase domain of DAPK1 is phylogenetically distinct from those of LRRK1 and LRRK2 . In particular , the DAPK1 kinase domain can be ascribed to the CaMK ( Ca 2 + / calmodulin - dependent kinase ) group , whereas MF - HAS1 does not contain a kinase domain . In contrast , LRRK1 and LRRK2 kinase domains belong to the TKL group of human protein kinases [ 6 ] , whose members show sequence similarity to both serine / threonine and tyrosine kinases . Within the TKL group , the LRRK kinase domains most resemble MLKs and RIPKs ( receptor - interacting protein kinases ) , which are crucial sensors of cellular stress [ 6 , 7 , 21 ] . The major differences between LRRK1 and LRRK2 are at the N - terminal region , where LRRK2 contains a large number of unique repeats [ 7 , 15 , 16 ] . Interestingly , the kinase activity of LRRK2 is inhibited by the N - terminal region , as truncated forms of LRRK2 , lacking the first 1326 amino acids , display a dramatic increase in kinase activity [ 22 , 23 ] . Moreover , phosphorylated serine residues at positions 910 and 935 of LRRK2 have been shown to bind 14 - 3 - 3 proteins ; this binding controls LRRK2 intracellular localization and probably also its cellular function [ 24 – 26 ] . Furthermore , in silico analysis indicates that the C - terminal region of LRRK2 shares a high degree of similarity with WD40 repeats known to form a circularized β - propeller structure . At the C - terminus , LRRK1 and LRRK2 are highly divergent , and LRRK1 does not display significant similarity with WD40 structures [ 27 ] . Interestingly , the C - terminal region in LRRK2 is indispensable for kinase activity , and even deletion of a few amino acids at the C - terminus results in complete abolishment of kinase function [ 22 ] . Overall , the absence of a complex and extended N - terminal region from LRRK1 , the minimal similarity of the C - terminal tail and the lack of homologous residues for 14 - 3 - 3 binding may represent important differences that affect protein function . Despite the major differences observed at the two terminal regions , pathological mutations in LRRK2 segregating with PD are clustered within the more conserved ROC – COR – kinasetri - domain . Thisobservationsuggestsakeyroleforthe tri - domain in governing LRRK proteins’ divergent functions , which are likely to depend on the diverse domains recruited in evolution , up to the possible implication of LRRK2 in pathological effects . Biochemical features As described above , despite clear differences at the N - and C - termini , the ROC – COR – kinase domain architecture is clearly preserved in both proteins . To date , the precise relationship between GTP binding and kinase activity of LRRK2 is unclear , as well as how mutations affect these activities and change protein function . Thus biochemical data obtained for LRRK1 may help to elucidate the molecular mechanism leading to LRRK2 - dependent PD . LRRK2 is a serine / threonine kinase that undergoes autophosphorylation in vitro [ 23 , 28 – 30 ] . Pathological muta - tions in the ROC – COR domain ( R1441G / C and Y1699C ) decrease GTPase activity , whereas there are clear indications that the G2019S mutation in the kinase domain augments kinase activity [ 30 , 31 ] . Because different mutations in different enzymatic domains cause the same pathological outcome , it is possible that an intramolecular regulatory interplay between the kinase and GTPase domains may exist . Since LRRK2 was classified as a G - protein , which cycles between GDP - and GTP - bound conformations [ 32 ] , it was hypothesized that , upon GDP binding to the active site in ROC , kinase activity is decreased , whereas , upon GTP binding , kinase activity is increased [ 33 ] . This model is supported by evidence that the ROC domain stimulates C (cid:2) The Authors Journal compilation C (cid:2) 2012 Biochemical Society LRRK2 : Function and Dysfunction 1097 kinase activity [ 34 , 35 ] and therefore alteration of GTPase activity may result in deregulated kinase activity . On the other hand , the effect of binding of non - hydrolysable GTP analogues on kinase activity is modest , and binding of GDP has no measurable effect on kinase activity [ 35 , 36 ] . An alternative model predicts that the LRRK2 kinase domain regulates GTPase activity through autophosphorylation and that the GTPase activity itself is the signalling output . Supporting this model , several studies have found that potential autophosphorylation sites are mainly clustered within the ROC domain [ 23 , 37 – 41 ] . In analogy to RTKs ( receptor tyrosine kinases ) that undergo dimerization and subsequent autophosphorylation at multiple sites upon binding of the extracellular messenger [ 42 ] , LRRKs may also dimerize after recruiting an interacting partner and undergo autophoshorylation that then regulates its GTPase activity . Several lines of evidence indicate that LRRK2 is predominantly a dimer in cells [ 23 , 43 – 45 ] . At present , little is known about LRRK1 biochemical properties , and only a few reports describing either GTPase or kinase activities have been published . Korr et al . [ 9 ] proposed that LRRK1 acts as GDP / GTP - binding protein via its ROC domain [ 9 ] and undergoes autophosphorylation , although with lower efficiency than LRRK2 [ 9 , 11 , 46 ] . The kinase activity of LRRK1 is abolished by artificial mutations predicted to interfere with kinase activity , and the kinase enzymatic regulation seems to be affected by the fraction of saturation of the GTP - binding site , supporting the idea that the GTPase domain influences kinase activity [ 9 ] . One general difficulty in studying the function of LRRKs is that there are no clearly identified physiological substrates for LRRK2 kinase activity and no verified functional outputs for GTPase activity . In addition , none of the commonly used generic kinase substrates , such as histone H1 , casein or MBP ( myelin basic protein ) are phosphorylated by LRRK1 [ 9 ] . Furthermore , biochemical studies designed to unravelthemolecularmechanismsthatgovernLRRKprotein function are hindered by the lack of an efficient purification protocol of the full - length recombinant LRRK1 and LRRK2 proteins . To date , published studies that investigate the biochemical properties of the proteins report data on either the truncated recombinant LRRK2 [ 47 , 48 ] or recombinant protein with large affinity tags [ 22 ] designed to simplify the purification procedures . Furthermore , full - length LRRK2 expression is not feasible in prokaryotes , and the use of heterologous sources ( insect or mammalian cells ) yield only a few micrograms of recombinant material , a quantity still insufficient to either embark on structural studies or to set up crystallographic trials to define the three - dimensional structure , to date limited to the individual ROC domain [ 43 ] . Role of human LRRKs : intersecting or independent functions ? As mentioned above , mutations in the LRRK2 gene account for a significant proportion of autosomal - dominant and apparently sporadic PD , respectively 10 % and 1 – 2 % of all PD cases , whereas PD - linked mutations in LRRK1 have not been reported [ 8 ] . Although both LRRKs are basally phosphorylated , bind guanine nucleotides and display partial intracellular co - localization [ 9 , 11 ] , the introduction of disease - associated LRRK2 mutations into LRRK1 does not affect the autophosphorylation activity of LRRK1 , as well as the propensity of LRRK1 to induce cell death , as observed for mutated LRRK2 proteins [ 9 , 11 ] . As mentioned above , LRRK2 is predominantly present in the cell as a complex compatible with the size of a dimer [ 23 , 43 – 45 ] , and its dimeric nature seems to be responsible for the modulation of kinase activity [ 44 ] . In addition , LRRK2 was observed to exist also as a monomer , probably inactive [ 44 , 45 , 49 ] . Given the high degree of homology and the similar domain organization between LRRK1 and LRRK2 , it is plausible to assume that LRRK1 has analogous quaternary - structural properties . This is supported by a study showing that dimerization is a general feature among members of the ROCO protein kinase family ( LRRK2 , LRRK1 and DAPK1 ) [ 50 ] . One report also suggests heterodimerization between LRRK1 and LRRK2 [ 51 ] . Similarly , G - proteins activated by nucleotide - dependent dimerization ( GADs ) , a class of proteins to which LRRKs have been ascribed , undergo pseudo - trans - homodimerization , a reaction that can occur between two different G - proteins of the same family with identical active - site residues [ 32 ] . In this scenario , LRRK1 – LRRK2 heterodimerization could influence the dimer – oligomer equilibrium of LRRK2 and affect its kinase activity . However , a role for LRRK1 as modulator of LRRK2 quaternary structure needs to be explored further , in particular , investigating whether LRRK2 pathological mutations could disrupt heterodimerization . Although in the last few years large efforts have been made to elucidate the physiological and pathological function of LRRK2 , the LRRK2 signalling pathways remain elusive . LRRK2 has been suggested to play a role in the control and maintenance of neurite length [ 52 – 54 ] , in activation of apoptosis through interaction with the death adaptor FADD ( Fas - associated death domain ) [ 55 ] , in controlling protein translation through phosphorylation of 4E - BP1 [ 19 ] , and interaction with the microRNA pathway to regulate protein synthesis [ 56 ] . Several groups have also reported that LRRK2 interacts with tubulins and the actin cytoskeleton , suggesting a role in cytoskeleton dynamics [ 57 – 60 ] . More recently , several papers proposed a role for LRRK2 in controlling the autophagic process [ 61 – 65 ] , suggesting that impairment in autophagic flux as a consequence of pathological mutations may deregulate proteins and organelle homoeostasis and , in turn , lead to neurodegeneration . The cellular function of LRRK1 has been much less scrutinized because LRRK1 is not clearly linked to a human disease . In 2011 , Hanafusa et al . [ 66 ] published an elegant paper demonstrating that LRRK1 plays a role in endocytosis of EGFR ( epidermal growth factor receptor ) . In this study , it was shown that LRRK1 forms a complex with activated EGFR through an interaction with Grb2 ( growth - factor - receptor - bound C (cid:2) The Authors Journal compilation C (cid:2) 2012 Biochemical Society 1098 Biochemical Society Transactions ( 2012 ) Volume 40 , part 5 Figure 2 LRRK expression proﬁle and implication for PD pathology The expression levels of LRRK1 and LRRK2 are quite similar in several organs such as the heart ( 3 ) , the lungs ( 2 ) and muscles ( 4 ) . LRRK2 is highly expressed in the brain ( 1 ) , the kidneys ( 7 ) and in immune cells ( 9 ) , whereas LRRK1 is nearly absent from these sites . This difference between the two proﬁles is particular relevant as PD is a disease of the central nervous system and the phenotype observed in Lrrk2 − / − mice shows accumulation of α - synuclein in the kidneys . 1 , brain ; 2 , lungs ; 3 , heart ; 4 , muscles ; 5 , stomach ; 6 , liver ; 7 , kidneys ; 8 , gut ; 9 , immune system .

Recently , the same authors investigated further the mechanism by which LRRK1 regulates endosome trafficking [ 67 ] . They showed that EGFR regulates the kinase activity of LRRK1 via Tyr 944 phosphorylation . Mutation of LRRK1 at Tyr 944 ( Y944F ) abolishesEGF ( epidermalgrowthfactor ) - stimulatedtyrosine phosphorylation , resulting in hyperactivation of LRRK1 kinase activity and enhanced motility of EGF - containing endosomes towards the perinuclear region . Of note , Hanafusa et al . [ 66 ] did not observe an interaction of LRRK2 with the EGFR – Grb2 complex . However , LRRK2 was found to interact with AP - 2 ( adaptor protein 2 ) [ 60 ] , a protein that forms complexes involved in the internalization of activated EGFR [ 68 ] . At the subcellular level , LRRK2 was shown to be diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm [ 11 ] , but also to associate with membranous and vesicular structures [ 45 , 64 , 69 – 71 ] . Accordingtoitspartialmembranelocalization , there is evidence suggesting a role for LRRK2 in vesicle trafficking through interaction with presynaptic endocytic machinery [ 60 , 71 ] and vesicle sorting between axons and dendrites [ 72 ] , as well as lysosomal function [ 61 , 64 ] . In particular , LRRK2 interacts with early endosomal Rab5 [ 71 ] , and LRRK2 silencing in cultured neurons impairs synaptic exocytosis causing abnormal trafficking and distribution of presynaptic vesicles [ 60 , 71 ] . As mentioned above , LRRK2 was shown to interact with α - and β - tubulins [ 57 – 59 ] , the microtubule components , suggesting that LRRK2 may control synaptic vesicle movement along axons . Of note , LRRK1 was found to interact with NudC and CLIP - 170 ( cytoplasmic linker protein 170 ) [ 66 ] , proteins involved in the dynein - mediated endocytosis process [ 73 , 74 ] . Taken together , these observations imply that LRRK1 and LRRK2 may share convergent functions , possibly acting as scaffolds in different steps of the endocytic pathway . Several studies also analysed LRRK mRNA and protein levels in different tissues and organs ; these data indicate that the expression of the two proteins generally overlaps and , in some tissues , levels are comparable [ 11 , 12 , 51 ] . However , C (cid:2) The Authors Journal compilation C (cid:2) 2012 Biochemical Society LRRK2 : Function and Dysfunction 1099 in organs such as the brain and the kidneys , LRRK2 mRNA expression is higher than that of LRRK1 [ 12 ] ( Figure 2 ) . This observation is particularly relevant since PD is a disease of the central nervous system , but also considering that a major phenotypic alteration reported from Lrrk2 − / − mice is observed in kidneys [ 65 ] . Specifically , Lrrk2 − / − mice show a striking accumulation and aggregation of α - synuclein in boxy cells of renal tubules in the cortical area of kidneys [ 65 ] . If LRRK1 and LRRK2 possess partially overlapping functions , then LRRK1 may compensate for the effects of LRRK2 deficiency only in those tissues where their expression is similar , but not in the brain or kidneys where LRRK1 expression is low . To summarize , even if LRRK1 and LRRK2 originate from a common ancestor , it seems that they have become specialized for different functions . LRRK proteins possess a number of repeats with a low degree of conservation ; these domains are known to be implicated in protein – protein interactions [ 75 ] . LRRK proteins may exhibit a similar molecular mechanism with regard to ROC – COR – kinase domain function , but interactions with different partners differentially regulate and target their cellular functions . Recent results strongly suggest that LRRK2 plays a role in inflammatory response [ 76 – 80 ] . Accordingly , its expression in immune cells and tissues was shown to be very high in comparison with other tissues , suggesting that hPBMCs ( human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ) and macrophages are good models to study LRRK2 function . One study shows that LRRK1 mRNA expression is present at very low levels in , or totally absent from , hPBMCs and , unlike LRRK2 , LRRK1 protein expression is not induced by interferon γ [ 79 ] , suggesting that LRRK1 is not implicated in immune response functions . Since there is evidence that chronically activated microglia and astrocytes contribute to PD [ 81 ] , lack of LRRK1 in immune tissues may not compensate for LRRK2 function , thus leading to the pathological results observed in PD . In conclusion , in order to shed more light on LRRK function and dysfunction , the next key steps will be to study in parallel the effects of double LRRK1 and LRRK2 deficiency in murine models , as well as the detailed signalling pathways regulated by the two proteins .
