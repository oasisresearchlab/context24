The dynamin family of GTPases mediates the scission of endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane . We report here that dynamin 2 , a ubiquitously expressed dynamin isoform , has a role in phagocytosis in macrophages . Dynamin 2 is enriched on early phagosomes , and expression of a dominant - negative mutant of dynamin 2 significantly inhibits particle internal - ization at the stage of membrane extension around the particle . This arrest in phagocytosis re - sembles that seen with inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) , and inhibition of PI3K prevents the recruitment of dynamin to the site of particle binding . Although expression of mutant dynamin in macrophages inhibited particle internalization , it had no effect on the pro - duction of inflammatory mediators elicited by particle binding . Key words : phagocytosis • macrophages • dynamin • inﬂammation • phosphoinositide 3 - kinase M acrophages are “professional phagocytes” that play a critical role in innate and acquired immunity due to their unique ability to internalize and degrade pathogens and to couple this to the release of inflammatory mediators . Phagocytosis is initiated by the interaction of specific re - ceptors on the surface of the phagocyte with ligands on the particle . Although all phagocytosis requires actin polymer - ization , phagocytosis mediated through different receptors uses distinct mechanisms and results in different biological outcomes ( 1 ) . Thus , macrophage phagocytosis of pathogens initiates inflammation , whereas the phagocytosis of apop - totic cells does not initiate a proinflammatory response ( 2 ) . The specific molecular regulators of particle internalization and the mechanisms of coupling to the production of in - flammatory mediators are largely unknown . While cells use phagocytosis to internalize large particles , soluble ligands are internalized through receptor - mediated endocytosis , a clathrin - based process . Dynamin 2 is a ubiqui - tously expressed GTPase that has a critical role in the scis - sion of forming clathrin - coated endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane ( 3 ) . Flies with a temperature - sensitive mutation in shibire , the Drosophila homologue of dynamin , have impaired endocytosis at the synaptic junction that re - sults in their rapid paralysis at the nonpermissive tempera - ture ( 4 , 5 ) . The nerve terminals of these mutant flies are depleted of synaptic vesicles and have an accumulation of partially invaginated coated pits at the cell surface ( 6 ) . This defect in endocytosis is also found in several other tissues in these flies ( 7 – 9 ) . In mammalian cells , dominant - negative mutant forms of dynamin that are unable to bind GTP inhibit receptor - mediated endocytosis ( 10 – 12 ) . When permeabilized nerve termini are treated with the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue , GTP (cid:103) S , tubular membrane invaginations coated with heli - cal arrays of dynamin are formed ( 13 ) . Similarly , dynamin assembles into collar - like rings around the neck of the tu - bular liposomes , and hydrolysis of GTP by dynamin leads to an active scission of these tubules into discrete vesicles ( 14 – 16 ) . The precise mechanism by which dynamin functions in vesicle scission is controversial ; some evidence supports dynamin acting as a mechanical force generator ( 13 – 15 ) , whereas other data suggest that it acts as a classical GTPase switch that activates a downstream effector ( 17 ) . Dynamin 2 is also involved in membrane traffic at the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) . 1 A neutralizing antibody di - rected against dynamin 2 inhibits the formation of both clathrin - and non – clathrin - coated vesicles at the TGN in vitro ( 18 ) . There is also strong evidence that the Saccharo - myces cerevisiae dynamin homologue , Vps1p , modulates ve - sicular trafficking from the TGN ( 19 ) . Dynamin 2 is targeted to forming endosomes through its interaction with the Src homology ( SH ) 3 domain of am - phiphysin ( 20 – 22 ) . Thus , overexpression of the SH3 do - 1 Abbreviations used in this paper : eGFP , enhanced GFP ; GFP , green fluores - cent protein ; LDL , low - density lipoprotein ; PI3K , phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ; RP , resident peritoneal ; SH , Src homology ; TGN , trans - Golgi network ; TRITC , tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate . on A p r il 5 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published December 20 , 1999 1850 Dynamin 2 and Macrophage Phagocytosis main of amphiphysin blocks receptor - mediated endocytosis at nerve terminals and in Cos - 7 cells ( 23 , 24 ) . We recently cloned amphiphysin from an expression library using an mAb generated against mouse macrophage phagosomes , and have shown that amphiphysin is enriched on phagosomes ( our unpublished results ) . This suggested a possible role for dynamin in phagocytosis . We report here that dynamin 2 localizes to forming phagosomes , and that a mutant form of dynamin 2 inhibits phagocytosis at the stage of membrane extension around the particle , but does not impair particle - mediated stimulation of inflammatory mediators . Materials and Methods DNA Expression Vectors . Full - length dynamin 2 ( aa isoform ) with a single amino acid mutation that changed the lysine at posi - tion 44 to an alanine , dyn K44A , was cloned into the pTIGZ2 vec - tor . In this vector , expression of dyn K44A is under the control of a tetracycline - repressible promoter . Removal of tetracycline from the media results in a bicistronic mRNA that concomitantly di - rects translation of the dominant - negative dynamin protein and green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) . pTIGZ2 consists of pcDNA3 . 1 / Zeo ( Invitrogen ) in which the CMV promoter was replaced by the tetracycline - regulated promoter from pTetSplice ( XhoI - HindIII fragment ; GIBCO BRL ) followed by a multiple cloning site , the cap - independent translational enhancer region of pCITE ( ampli - fied using the 5 (cid:57) primer , GTGGATCCGTTATTTTCCACCAT - ATT , and the 3 (cid:57) reverse primer , GGGAGCTCCCATATTAT - CATCGTGTT ; Novagen ) and the coding region for enhanced GFP ( eGFP ) from peGFP - N1 ( EcoRI - NotI fragment ; Clontech ) . V5 epitope – tagged dynamin 2 and dyn K44A were constructed by TA cloning into the pcDNA3 . 1 / V5 / HisTOPO vector ( Invitrogen ) . pNeo / Tak was constructed to direct expression of the tetracy - cline transactivator under neomycin selection . The plasmid uses a tetracycline - regulated promoter to direct expression of the tetra - cycline transactivator ( both from pTet - Tak ; GIBCO BRL ) . The neomycin resistance marker was from pcDNA3 ( Invitrogen ) , and the remainder of the plasmid was derived from pBluescript SK ( Stratagene ) . Immunofluorescence Characterization . Murine resident peritoneal ( RP ) macrophages were isolated and cultured as described previ - ously ( 1 ) . Synchronized phagosomes were created by centrifuging particles onto the cells at 1 , 600 rpm and 4 (cid:56) C for 1 min . ( Before exposure to C3b i - opsonized particles , cells were treated with 200 nM PMA for 30 min . ) After washing with PBS , the cells were incu - bated in media at 37 (cid:56) C for the times indicated in the Results . The cells were fixed in formalin ( 10 min , room temperature ) , permea - bilized in 0 . 25 % Triton X - 100 in PBS ( 10 min , room tempera - ture ) , washed twice in PBS , and incubated with primary antibody ( Dyn 2 , an affinity - purified anti - dynamin 2 antibody generated as described [ 25 ] ; MC63 , an anti - pan dynamin antibody generated as described [ 26 ] ; or the anti - V5 antibody [ Invitrogen ] , and anti – human RBC antibody purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs ) for 1 h at room temperature . The coverslips were washed in PBS and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies ( all FITC - and TxR - conjugated antibodies were from Cappel , Cy5 conjugates from Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs ) . Actin was stained with rhodamine - phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) . After a 1 - h incubation , the slides were washed in PBS , rinsed briefly in dis - tilled water , and mounted in a polyvinyl alcohol – based mounting medium ( Harlow and Lane ) . All confocal images were obtained on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with Bio - Rad confo - cal optics . IgG - coated RBCs were prepared by incubating fresh human RBCs , diluted in PBS , with anti – human glycophorin IgG ( Jack - son ImmunoResearch Labs ) at room temperature for 60 min . Com - plement - coated RBCs were prepared by incubating human red cells with anti – human glycophorin IgM ( supernatant from the NN3 hybridoma ; American Type Culture Collection ) at room temperature for 30 min , and the cells were then washed and re - suspended in RPMI with 10 % C5 - depleted human serum ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) , and incubated at 37 (cid:56) C for 1 h . Zymosan ( Molec - ular Probes ) was prepared as described previously ( 27 ) . Phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) was inhibited by incubating RP macrophages with 100 nM wortmannin ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) for 1 h . These cells were incubated with zymosan for 10 min , then prepared and examined as above . Immunoblotting . Macrophages , either RP or RAW 264 . 7 cells ( American Type Culture Collection ) , were lysed on ice into lysis buffer ( 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 120 mM NaCl , 10 % glycerol , 2 mM EDTA , 1 mM dithiothreitol , and 1 % SDS , 0 . 09 trypsin inhibitor units [ TIU ] aprotinin , 0 . 5 mg / ml leupeptin , 1 mM PMSF ) . Total murine brain homogenate was lysed into brain lysis buffer ( 10 mM Hepes , 150 mM NaCl , 10 mM benzamidine , 1 % Triton X - 100 with the same protease inhibitors as above ) , incubated at 4 (cid:56) C with agitation for 1 h , and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 40 , 000 g for 1 h at 4 (cid:56) C . Samples were quantified by the BCA assay ( Pierce Chemical Co . ) , and 20 (cid:109) g of protein / well was run on a 10 % SDS - PAGE acrylamide gel . Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride ( PVDF ) membrane ( Mil - lipore ) and blocked overnight at 4 (cid:56) C in 10 % nonfat dried milk in PBS . Membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with one of the anti - dynamin antibodies ( either Dyn 2 [ 25 ] or the anti - dynamin 1 rabbit polyclonal antibody DG2 , provided by Pietro De Camilli , Yale University School of Medicine , New Ha - ven , CT ) , washed three times for 15 min each in TBS / Tween and incubated in a 1 : 10 , 000 dilution of peroxidase - conjugated sec - ondary antibody ( Cappel ) . After three 15 - min washes in TBS / Tween , specific binding was detected using chemiluminescence ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) . Cell Surface Staining . Cells to be stained for Fc (cid:103) RII and Fc (cid:103) RIII were resuspended into FACS ® buffer ( PBS , 2 % FCS , 0 . 5 mM azide ) while cells to be stained for Mac - 1 were resuspended into 2 . 4G2 su - pernatant ( American Type Culture Collection ) , then incubated for 15 min on ice . Primary antibody ( biotinylated 2 . 4G2 for FcR stain - ing or biotinylated anti – mouse CD11b antibody , both from Phar - Mingen ) was added , and the cells were incubated on ice for 20 min . Cells were washed in FACS ® buffer , resuspended in diluted strepta - vidin - PE ( Caltag ) , and incubated on ice for 15 min . The cells were washed , resuspended in FACS ® buffer with 1 % paraformaldehyde , and analyzed on a FACScan™ ( Becton Dickinson ) . Transfections . A tetracycline transactivator – expressing RAW cell line was generated by transfecting RAW 264 . 7 cells with pNeo / Tak , and stable cell lines were selected using 400 (cid:109) g / ml G418 ( GIBCO BRL ) . After 10 d of selection , the cells were cloned by limiting dilution , and one cell line ( designated RAW - TT10 ) that demonstrated good tetracycline - regulated expression from a subsequently transfected reporter plasmid was used for all experi - ments . In the experiments reported here , tetracycline was always absent from the media , resulting in strong activity of the tetracy - cline - regulated promoter . RAW - TT10 cells were transiently transfected by electropora - tion . 10 (cid:109) g of DNA was added to 5 (cid:51) 10 6 RAW - TT10 cells in 250 (cid:109) l of RPMI ( JRH Biosciences ) with 10 % heat - inactivated on A p r il 5 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published December 20 , 1999 1851 Gold et al . FCS ( Hyclone ) . The cells were electroporated at 280 V , capaci - tance 960 (cid:109) F , and immediately washed in 5 ml of RPMI with 10 % FCS . The cells were plated and analyzed 18 – 24 h later by FACS ® or confocal microscopy . Phagocytosis Assay . Tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate ( TRITC ) - zymosan was purchased from Molecular Probes . TRITC - labeled SRBC “ghosts” were prepared by incubating SRBCs ( ICN / Cappel ) in hypotonic lysis buffer ( 1 mM MgCl 2 , 100 (cid:109) M EGTA in 0 . 02 (cid:51) PBS ) with TRITC - BSA ( Molecular Probes ) on ice for 1 h . Isotonicity was restored to the cells with 5 (cid:51) PBS , and the ghosts were resealed at 37 (cid:56) C for 1 h . Unincor - porated TRITC - BSA was removed by washing in PBS , and the ghosts were opsonized as described above ( anti - SRBC IgG and IgM were purchased from Intercell ) . The specified particles were centrifuged onto the transiently transfected RAW - TT10 cells at 1 , 600 rpm and 4 (cid:56) C for 1 min . ( Before exposure to C3b i - opsonized particles , cells were treated with 200 nM PMA for 30 min . ) The cells were incubated at 37 (cid:56) C for 10 min . The extracellular particles were removed , ghosts were lysed with a 20 - s water wash , and the TRITC - zymosan was digested for 10 min with 100 U / ml lyticase ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) . The cells were resuspended in PBS / EDTA , fixed with 1 % formalin , and analyzed by FACS ® . The effect of dynamin 1 on phagocytosis was assessed with three dominant - negative mutants of dynamin 1 expressed in pCMV5 : DI (cid:68) PH ( deletion of amino acids 541 – 618 ) , DI K535M , and DI N272 ( deletion of amino acids 1 – 272 ) ( 28 ) . Each of these con - structs was cotransfected with pSFFV - eGFP ( eGFP under the con - trol of the spleen focus – forming virus LTR ) into RAW - TT10 cells , and phagocytosis was assayed as described above . TNF Assay . RAW - TT10 cells were transfected with dyn K44A - pTIGZ2 18 h before the assay . The cells were incubated with the indicated particles at 37 (cid:56) C for 30 min , at which time 5 (cid:109) M brefeldin A was added to the media . The zymosan particles were endo - toxin free as assessed by the limulus amebocyte lysate assay ( QCL - 1000 ; BioWhittaker ) . The cells were incubated for an ad - ditional 2 . 5 h , then collected for staining . The cells were blocked in 2 . 4G2 hybridoma supernatant ( American Type Culture Col - lection ) for 15 min on ice , fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature , washed , and stained with anti – TNF - (cid:97) antibody ( PharMingen ) conjugated to PE in permeabilization buffer ( 1 % FCS , 0 . 1 % [ wt / vol ] sodium azide , 0 . 1 % [ wt / vol ] sa - ponin , in PBS , pH 7 . 4 ) at room temperature for 30 min , washed , and analyzed on a FACScan™ ( with CELLQuest™ software ; both from Becton Dickinson ) . Video Microscopy . RAW - TT10 cells were transfected with dyn K44A - pTIGZ and plated on 35 - mm glass - bottomed microwell dishes ( MatTek Corp . ) . 18 h later , the dish was mounted on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with a cooled CCD camera ( Princeton Instruments ) and Metamorph digital imaging software system ( Universal Imaging ) , and differential interference contrast ( DIC ) images were collected every 30 s . Scanning Electron Microscopy . 18 h after transfection , cells ex - pressing high levels of the indicated proteins were sorted onto Thermonox coverslips ( Nunc ) using a FACStar PLUS™ ( Becton Dickinson ) . Cells were adhered for 3 h at 37 (cid:56) C , then incubated with IgG - opsonized SRBCs for the indicated amount of time . Cells were fixed in 3 % glutaraldehyde in EM buffer ( 0 . 1 M caco - dylate , 0 . 1 M sucrose ) at room temperature for 1 h , then washed with EM buffer . The cells were postfixed in 1 % OsO 4 in 0 . 1 M cacodylate , 4 mM CaCl , pH 7 . 3 , for 30 min at room tempera - ture . The cells were dehydrated through serial changes in ethanol ( 35 and 50 % ) for 5 min each , en bloc stained in 3 % uranyl ace - tate , 70 % ethanol for 30 min , and ethanol dehydration was then completed ( 80 , 90 , 95 , 100 , and 100 % , each for 5 min ) . The cov - erslips were critical point dried , mounted onto scanning stubs , and air dried overnight . Cells were sputter coated with 30 nm gold / palladium and examined on a Jeol JSM - 6300F scanning electron microscope . Results Dynamin 2 Is Enriched on Early Phagosomes in Macrophages . Dynamin 2 was found to be expressed in murine RP macro - phages and the RAW - TT10 macrophage cell line , whereas dynamin 1 was not detected in macrophages ( Fig . 1 A ) . In - terestingly , dynamin 2 was recruited to early phagosomes , as demonstrated by staining with two independent antibod - ies to dynamin as well as by the localization of the epitope - tagged protein ( Fig . 1 B ) . The phagocytosis of different particles is mediated by different receptors . For example , FcRs mediate the uptake of IgG - coated particles , comple - ment receptors ( CRs ) mediate the uptake of C3b i - opsonized particles , and the mannose receptor ( among others ) medi - ates the uptake of zymosan ( yeast cell wall particles ) ( 2 ) . Phagocytosis stimulated by these receptors has common features , such as a reliance on the actin cytoskeleton , and distinct features , such as their different requirement for the cytoskeletal proteins vinculin and paxillin ( 1 ) . Immunoflu - orescence microscopy of murine RP macrophages using two independent antibodies demonstrated that dynamin 2 was enriched on early phagosomes containing IgG - opson - ized RBCs , C3b i - opsonized RBCs , and zymosan ( Fig . 1 B , i , iii , vii , and viii ) . In addition , an epitope - tagged version of the aa isoform of dynamin 2 transiently expressed in RAW - TT10 macrophages also localized to phagosomes , demonstrating that this macrophage - expressed isoform contains the domain responsible for targeting to phagosomes ( Fig . 1 B , iv and v ) . The kinetics of association of dynamin 2 with phagosomes precisely mirrored that of F - actin : both were recruited to the forming phagocytic cup and the early phagosome ( Fig . 1 B , v and vi ) , and both were concomi - tantly lost from the phagosome after particle internalization ( data not shown ) . Dynamin 2 Is Critical for Macrophage Phagocytosis . To ex - amine the role of dynamin 2 in phagocytosis , RAW - TT10 macrophages were transfected with a dominant - negative mutant form of the aa isoform of dynamin 2 , dyn K44A , which is unable to bind GTP ( 11 ) . The mutant dynamin 2 gene was expressed in a bicistronic vector with GFP ( pTIGZ2 vector ) , allowing transiently transfected cells to be identi - fied by their green fluorescence . Phagocytosis of either TRITC - labeled zymosan , IgG - opsonized RBCs , or C3b i - opsonized RBCs was assessed as a function of the level of expression of the GFP / dominant - negative protein by two - color FACS ® ( Fig . 2 ) . In all cases , dyn K44A inhibited phago - cytosis in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 2 A ) ; a typical FACS ® profile is shown in Fig . 2 B . Dyn K44A inhibited FcR - mediated phagocytosis by 85 % , CR - mediated phago - cytosis by 63 % , and zymosan phagocytosis by 65 % ( Fig . 2 C ) . As expected , dyn K44A also inhibited receptor - medi - on A p r il 5 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published December 20 , 1999 1852 Dynamin 2 and Macrophage Phagocytosis Figure 1 .

A protein of the expected 100 - kD size was detected in macrophages by the anti - dynamin 2 antibody but was not detected by the anti - dynamin 1 antibody . ( B ) Synchronized phagosomes containing either zymosan particles ( i – vi ) , com - plement - opsonized RBCs ( vii ) , or IgG - opsonized RBCs ( viii ) were created in RP macrophages ( i , ii , iii , vii , viii ) or in transiently transfected RAW - TT10 cell ex - pressing V5 epitope – tagged dy - namin 2 ( iv – vi ) . 5 min after par - ticle binding , cells were fixed and prepared for immunofluo - rescence . Dynamin 2 was de - tected with the anti - dynamin 2 antibody Dyn 2 ( i , vii , and viii ) or the pan anti - dynamin antibody MC63 ( iii ) ; V5 epitope – tagged dynamin was detected with anti - V5 antibody ( iv and v ) ; actin was stained with rhodamine - phalloidin ( vi ) ; and zymosan was visualized directly ( ii ) . Dynamin enrichment on phagocytic cups and phagosomes ( v ) colocalized with F - actin ( vi ) . Figure 2 . Dyn K44A inhibits mac - rophage phagocytosis .

Phagocytosis is expressed as the percentage of transfected cells internalizing particles relative to the percentage of untransfected cells internalizing particles .

V5 epitope – tagged dyn K44A colocalized with actin on na - scent phagocytic cups , demonstrating that the mutant is also recruited to the site of particle - induced signaling and establishing that it is correctly localized to inhibit the func - tion of dynamin on phagosomes ( Fig . 4 ) . This construct also inhibited phagocytosis ( data not shown ) , and its effects were indistinguishable from those seen with untagged dyn K44A . These effects were specific for dynamin 2 , since dominant - negative mutants of dynamin 1 did not inhibit phagocytosis or receptor - mediated endocytosis in macro - phages ( data not shown ) . The defect in phagocytosis was not due to an effect of dyn K44A on the level of phagocytic receptors , since trans - fected cells expressed normal cell surface levels of FcRs ( CD16 and CD32 ) and CRs ( Mac - 1 ) ( data not shown ) , and particle binding was unimpaired ( Table I ; and see Figs . 4 and 5 ) . Cell viability and other actin - based processes were unaffected by the expression of dyn K44A as demon - strated by the observations that RAW - TT10 cells express - ing dyn K44A were able to migrate , polarize , extend and re - tract ruffles , and spread in response to phorbol esters ( data not shown ) . Further , engagement of phagocytic receptors stimulated actin polymerization at the site of particle bind - ing ( Fig . 4 ) . In addition , mutant dynamin had no effect on particle - induced TNF - (cid:97) production ( see Fig . 7 , below ) , demonstrating that one arm ( internalization ) of a bifurcat - ing signaling pathway was selectively inhibited . Dynamin 2 Is Required for Membrane Extension around the Forming Phagosome . Our initial hypothesis was that dy - namin would serve a similar role in phagocytosis as it serves in endocytosis and therefore would be required only for scis - sion of the nascent phagosome from the plasma membrane . However , examination of dyn K44A - expressing RAW - TT10 cells attempting to internalize particles revealed that dynamin was exerting a role earlier in the process . Cells expressing dyn K44A were able to bind particles , and phalloidin staining demonstrated that this was accompanied by localized actin polymerization ; however , actin extended only partially around the particles ( Fig . 4 ) . To determine the stage at which phagocytosis was arrested , dyn K44A - expressing RAW - TT10 cells were studied by scanning electron microscopy . 10 min after contacting IgG - coated SRBCs , control cells ( expressing pTIGZ2 alone ) were identified at many different stages of particle internalization ( Fig . 5 A ) , while very few of the dyn K44A - expressing cells extended membrane more than halfway around the SRBCs ( Fig . 5 B ) . This indicated that mutant dynamin arrested particle internalization at an inter - mediate stage . Indeed , after unbound SRBCs were washed away and phagocytosis was allowed to proceed for an addi - tional 50 min at 37 (cid:56) C , the pTIGZ2 control cells had inter - nalized (cid:46) 90 % of the particles ( Fig . 5 C , and Table I ) . In contrast , (cid:44) 30 % of the particles associated with the dyn K44A - expressing cells were internalized ( Fig . 5 D , and Table I ) . PI3K is a key regulator of macrophage phagocytosis ( 29 , Figure 3 . Dynamin 2 blocks receptor - mediated endocytosis in mac - rophages . RAW - TT10 cells , transfected with the TIGZ control vector ( thin solid line ) or the dyn K44A vector ( thick solid line ) , were incubated with 20 (cid:109) g / ml of DiI - labeled acetylated LDL ( DiI AcLDL ) for 30 min at 37 (cid:56) C . As a control , untransfected cells were incubated with the same con - centration of DiI AcLDL at 4 (cid:56) C ( dashed line ) . Cells were collected and analyzed by flow cytometry . The amount of intracellular DiI AcLDL is indicated on the x - axis in log fluorescence units . The histograms were generated by gating on the highly expressing transfected cells ( see Fig . 2 B for sample gates ) . The gates used in this experiment were the same as those used to assay phagocytosis . Figure 4 . Dyn K44A colocalized with F - actin on phagocytic cups . RAW - TT10 cells transfected with V5 epitope – tagged dyn K44A were in - cubated with zymosan for 10 min , fixed , and stained with the anti - V5 an - tibody . Actin was visualized with rhodamine - phalloidin . Arrows indicate where tagged dyn K44A colocalized with actin on partially formed phago - cytic cups . Table I .

Examination of parallel samples by fluorescence confirmed that after 1 h , (cid:46) 90 % of the particles on the control cells were internalized , whereas (cid:44) 30 % of the particles associated with the dyn K44A - expressing cells were internalized . on A p r il 5 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published December 20 , 1999 1854 Dynamin 2 and Macrophage Phagocytosis 30 ) . Inhibition of PI3K causes incomplete phagosome clo - sure ( 29 , 30 ) , a very similar phenotype to that observed in cells expressing mutant dynamin . Inhibition of PI3K with wortmannin prevented the recruitment of dynamin 2 to the site of particle binding and actin polymerization ( Fig . 6 , A and B ) . Thus , it is possible that PI3K might act upstream of dynamin in phagocytosis . Dynamin 2 Selectively Uncouples Particle Internalization from Particle - induced Cytokine Production . Macrophage phagocy - tosis of IgG - coated particles and zymosan results in several signaling events , including the production of inflammatory mediators such as TNF - (cid:97) ( 2 ) . Cells expressing dyn K44A gener - ated normal amounts of TNF - (cid:97) upon interaction with parti - cles ( Fig . 7 ) ; thus , mutant dynamin uncoupled particle inter - nalization from particle - dependent cytokine production . Discussion In this study , we have demonstrated that dynamin 2 is essential to the formation of macrophage phagosomes , and that it functions at the stage of membrane extension around the particle . This role for dynamin is conserved in all of the Figure 5 . Dyn K44A inhibits membrane extension around the forming phagosome . Transiently transfected cells were sorted by FACS ® , and cells expressing the highest levels of GFP were stud - ied by scanning electron micros - copy . Sorted cells were incu - bated with IgG - coated SRBCs for 10 min ( A and B ) or for 1 h ( C and D ) . After a 10 - min inter - nalization , control pTIGZ2 – transfected cells demonstrated various stages of particle internal - ization ( A ) , and after 1 h , (cid:46) 90 % of the particles were internalized ( C ) . By contrast , cells expressing dyn K44A could only extend mem - brane partially around the bound particles at both time points ( B and D ) . The size bar shown in D applies to A – D . Figure 6 . Dynamin is not recruited to the site of particle binding in macrophages treated with the PI3K inhibitor , wortman - nin . Murine RP macrophages were treated with wortmannin for 1 h and incubated with zymosan for 10 min . Arrows indicate the site of zymosan binding . Actin polymerized un - der the bound particles ( A ) , but dynamin was not enriched in the actin pedestals ( B ) . on A p r il 5 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published December 20 , 1999 1855 Gold et al . phagocytic receptor systems examined . Dominant - negative mutant dynamin did not impinge on the cell’s capacity to po - lymerize actin beneath the particle , or to produce inflamma - tory mediators such as TNF - (cid:97) in response to particle binding . The phagocytic defect induced by dyn K44A resembles that seen when PI3K is inhibited in macrophages ( 29 , 30 ) . This is of interest , since dynamin interacts with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K and this interaction stimulates dynamin’s GTPase activity ( 31 ) . We report here that inhi - bition of PI3K prevents the recruitment of dynamin 2 to the site of particle binding , suggesting that the activation of PI3K is upstream of dynamin in mediating phagocytosis . PI3K supports phagocytosis in macrophages , in part , by facil - itating the insertion of membrane into forming phagosomes ( 30 ) . The scanning electron micrographs shown here suggest that membrane extension may also be the stage of arrest in the cells expressing dyn K44A . Membrane extension is known to require the fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane ( 30 , 32 – 35 ) ; thus , it is tempting to speculate that dynamin’s role in phagocytosis is related to its capacity to recruit mem - brane to nascent phagosomes . In support of this , the yeast homologue of dynamin , Vps1p , is required for bidirectional trafficking between endosomes and the vacuole ( 19 ) . Although our data suggest a role for dynamin 2 in extend - ing membrane around the nascent phagosome , it does not rule out other mechanisms for dynamin’s effect on phago - cytosis . For example , dynamin might have a direct effect on actin during phagosome formation , since it has been demon - strated to interact with profilin , an actin - binding protein ( 36 ) . It remains possible that dynamin is also involved in the scis - sion of the neck behind the phagosome , similar to its known role in endocytosis . However , we have not observed any en - richment of dynamin at the scission site of the phagosome . The phagocytosis of pathogens by macrophages is tightly coupled to the elaboration of inflammatory cytokines that , in turn , orchestrate an appropriate immune response . It has long been known that particle binding by macrophages in - duces actin - mediated internalization and inflammatory me - diator production through a bifurcating signaling cascade ( 37 , 38 ) . Dynamin clearly regulates the particle internaliza - tion limb of this pathway while it has no role in the pro - duction of inflammatory cytokines . We thank Dr .

Dyn K44A does not inhibit particle - induced inflammatory sig - naling . TNF - (cid:97) production induced by IgG - opsonized particles or by zy - mosan was analyzed by intracellular cytokine staining in RAW - TT10 cells transiently transfected with either control vector or dyn K44A . Com - plement - opsonized particles do not stimulate TNF - (cid:97) production in mac - rophages and therefore were not analyzed . ( A ) TNF - (cid:97) production is ex - pressed as the percentage of transfected cells producing the cytokine . ( B ) The amount of intracellular TNF - (cid:97) produced per cell is expressed on the x - axis as log fluorescence units . Unstimulated cells are represented by the dotted line ; nonexpressing control cells exposed to zymosan are shown by the bold solid line ; and cells expressing high levels of dyn K44A that were stimulated with zymosan are represented by the thin solid line .
