However , it is unknown if the worse outcomes are due to the confounding effect of demographic and obesity - related comorbidities . The study objective is to analyze associations between body mass index , patient characteristics , obesity - related comorbidity , and clinical outcomes in COVID - 19 patients . Methods : In this prospective cohort study , we chose patient records between March 1st , 2020 , and December 1st , 2022 , in a large tertiary care center in southeast Wisconsin in the United States . Patients over the age of 18 who tested positive were included in the study . Clinical outcomes included hospitalization , intensive care unit ( ICU ) admission , mechanical ventilation , and mortality rates . We examined the characteristics of patients who had positive clinical outcomes . We created unadjusted logistic regression models , sequentially adjusting for demographic and comorbidity variables , to assess the independent associations between BMI , patient characteristics , obesity - related comorbidities , and clinical outcomes . Results : From a record of 1 . 67 million inpatients and outpatients at Froedtert Health Center , 55 , 299 ( BMI : 30 . 5±7 . 4 kg / m2 , 62 . 5 % female ) tested COVID - 19 positive during the study period . 17 , 580 ( 31 . 8 % ) patients were admitted to hospitals , and 2 , 856 ( 16 . 2 % ) of hospitalized patients required ICU admission . 1038 ( 36 . 3 % ) required mechanical ventilation , and 462 ( 44 . 5 % ) died after a positive test for COVID - 19 . We found female patients show a higher hospitalization rate , while male patients have a higher rate of J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Page 3 of 32 ICU admission , mechanical ventilation , and mortality . Obesity - related comorbidities are associated with worse outcomes compared to simple obesity without comorbidities . In logistic regression models , we found four similar V - shaped associations between BMI and four clinical outcomes . Patients with a BMI of 25 kg / m2 are at the lowest risk for clinical outcomes . Patients with a BMI lower than 18 kg / m2 or higher than 30 kg / m2 are associated with a higher risk of hospitalization , ICU , mechanical ventilation , and death . After adjusting the model for demographic factors and hypertension and diabetes as two common comorbidities , we found that demographic factors do not significantly increase the risk . Obesity alone does not significantly increase the risk of severe clinical outcomes . Obesity - related comorbidities , on the other hand , resulted in a significantly higher risk of outcomes . Conclusion : Obesity alone does not increase the risk of worse clinical outcomes after COVID - 19 infection . It may suggest that the worse clinical outcomes of patients with obesity are mediated via hypertension and type 2 diabetes . Patients with obesity and comorbidities have a higher risk of poor outcomes . Obesity - related comorbidities , including hypertension and diabetes , are independently associated with poorer clinical outcomes among COVID - 19 patients . At a BMI of more than 30 kg / m2 or less than 18 kg / m2 , we found an increase in the risk of severe COVID - 19 outcomes leading to hospitalization , ICU , mechanical ventilation , and death . The increased risk of severe outcomes is not attributed to patient characteristics but can be attributed to hypertension and diabetes . Introduction J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Page 4 of 32 The COVID - 19 pandemic has had a global impact on health - care systems , with 308 million cases and 5 . 5 million deaths as of January 11 , 2022 1 . Individual lifestyles were altered as a result of the pandemic . Social isolation resulted in more time spent at home , increased social anxiety , and increased screen time , all of which led to an increase in the consumption of highly processed foods and fewer outdoor activities 2 . Obesity is becoming more prevalent due to these factors . Changing dietary habits , as well as environmental and physical activity factors , have all contributed to the rise in obesity rates since the 1980s 3 - 5 . Consequently , obesity will continue to be the leading risk factor affecting individual quality of life . Obesity can lead to many comorbidities , including cardiovascular disease , hypertension , and diabetes 5 , 6 . Association analyses 2 , 6 – 13 showed that obesity is a critical risk factor for COVID - 19 outcomes , such as a higher hospital admission rate , prolonged inpatient stays , and a higher risk of comorbidities . These comorbidities are likely to be predisposing factors for adverse outcomes of COVID - 19 14 . Investigating differences between obesity and obesity - related comorbidities can help better understand adverse outcomes . Recent studies 6 , 12 , 13 have investigated the association between obesity and adverse COVID - 19 outcomes . Obesity - related comorbidities , conversely , can be more important . In contrast to obesity , it is possible to manage obesity - related comorbidities in the short term to avoid potentially severe outcomes . No study has examined obesity - related comorbidities as an independent factor in COVID - 19 outcomes . This study hypothesized that common obesity - related comorbidities could predict COVID - 19 outcomes more accurately than obesity alone . In order to improve care quality , it is J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Page 5 of 32 suggested that patients with related comorbidities should be treated first after triage assessments . Subjects , Materials and Methods Data source and study cohort This retrospective cohort study used electronic health records from the Clinical Research Data Warehouse , which is a component of the Clinical and Translational Science Institute of Southeast Wisconsin . The Clinical and Translational Science Institute maintains a monthly mirror of the Froedtert and Medical College Electronic Health Records . A few address - and income - related demographic data fields have been redacted for patient privacy . The Froedtert and Medical College of Wisconsin Institutional Review Boards reviewed and approved this study . Patient inclusion and variable extraction This study included all patients who tested COVID - 19 - positive between March 1 st , 2020 , and December 1st , 2022 . COVID - 19 antigen test records were identified by diagnostic codes of the International Classification of Diseases ( ICD - 10 ) . This study identified obesity using body mass index ( BMI ) ranges : underweight ( BMI < 18 ) , normal ( 18 - 24 . 9 ) , overweight ( 25 – 29 . 9 ) , obesity class 1 ( 30 – 34 . 9 ) , class 2 ( 35 – 39 . 9 ) and class 3 ( BMI > 40 ) . The BMI was calculated based on medical records , which include the patients’ most recent height and weight , either self - reported or recorded at the practice site . Hypertension and diabetes were identified through ICD - 10 codes from records , as were comorbidities for patients with obesity . Regarding adverse outcomes , this study extracted hospital admission , intensive care unit ( ICU ) stay , mechanical ventilation , and death records for each patient . ICU admissions were identified from hospitalized J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Page 6 of 32 patients with recorded current procedural terminology ( CPT ) codes . Patients with mechanical ventilation were identified through an identical CPT code system . Patient death records were extracted from patient electronic health and demographic records . Appendix ( a ) shows a complete list of identification codes and procedures . Patients ' characteristics and demographic variables include their gender , age , race , place of residence , and area deprivation index . Self - reported gender ( male or female ) and race ( White or Caucasian , Black or African American , Asian , Other , including American Indian or Alaska Native , Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander , Mixed Race , and Other uncategorized races ) were included . Age was calculated based on the patient ' s age at the time of their most recent hospital visit . The patients ' residence variable is classified using the United States Department of Agriculture ' s Rural - Urban Continuum Code 36 . The Area Deprivation Index 37 was used to assess the patient ' s socioeconomic status . Outcomes The primary outcomes are clinical outcomes from COVID - 19 , including : ( 1 ) admission to hospital , defined as having at least one ICD - 10 code as an inpatient in the hospital record ; ( 2 ) ICU admission , defined as being admitted to the ICU according to the ICD - 10 code during hospitalization ; ( 3 ) mechanical ventilation , defined as having at least one record of a CPT code for mechanical ventilation during hospitalization ; and ( 4 ) death , defined as having the patients’ demographic health record status changed to " deceased " during the hospitalization . The secondary outcomes are associations among BMI categories , demographic variables , clinical outcomes , and comorbidities . The primary comorbidities are primary J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Page 7 of 32 hypertension , secondary hypertension , type 1 diabetes , and type 2 diabetes , defined by the corresponding ICD - 10 code in the medical record . We designed the following tables and figures to reveal the independent associations . ( 1 ) association between patient demographics and clinical outcomes ( Table 1 ) ; ( 2 ) association between BMI categories and clinical outcomes ( Figure 2 , A ) ; ( 3 ) association between BMI categories and risk of comorbidities ( Figure 2 , B ) ; ( 4 ) association between obesity - related comorbidities and adverse outcomes ( Figure 3 ) . We used additional statistical models to exclude the potential confounding effects of demographic and comorbidity variables . In addition , we stratified the associations by sex category to confirm if clinical outcomes and comorbidities have the same effects on male and female patients . Statistical analysis We used multivariate logistic regression models to obtain odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals as a risk evaluation of clinical outcomes . There are three main types of logistic regression models that are used to examine the risks of four clinical outcomes . ( 1 ) To evaluate the association between BMI categories and COVID - 19 outcomes , we use predefined BMI categories as a dependent variable and clinical outcomes as predictor variables to build an unadjusted model . A BMI of normal ( 18 - 24 . 9 ) was set as a reference odds ratio of 1 . 0 . The unadjusted model shows the risk of clinical outcomes under different BMI categories . We then added age category , sex , and race variables into the dependent variable list for the demographic - adjusted model . The purpose is to exclude the confounding effect of demographic variables . Lastly , we added the comorbidity variables to further J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Page 8 of 32 adjust the model for hypertension and diabetes . The odds ratios of unadjusted , demographically adjusted , and fully adjusted models are calculated with 95 % confidence interval estimates . A forest plot visualized the odds ratio of three models for comparison . ( 2 ) To show the comorbidities and COVID - 19 outcomes , we use the BMI category as a dependent variable and four comorbidity variables ( primary hypertension , secondary hypertension , type 1 diabetes , and type 2 diabetes ) as predictor variables for an unadjusted model . Similarly , demographic and BMI variables are added to the model to generate adjusted odds ratio estimates . A forest plot was made to show the estimated odds ratios and confidence intervals for each comorbidity for each of the four clinical outcomes . ( 3 ) To examine the non - linear associations between BMI and clinical outcomes , we set a baseline BMI of 25 . 0 kg / m2 . Using the specified dependent variables as predefined , we calculated odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals for each BMI range from 15 to 50 . Each BMI value yields an estimate of the odds ratio as well as an upper and lower 95 % confidence interval . Three curves were generated from the connected upper 95 % confidence intervals of odds ratios , estimates of odds ratios , and lower 95 % confidence intervals of odds ratios under each BMI value . We repeat the procedure for unadjusted , partially adjusted , and fully adjusted models . We completed all analyses and models in the R programming language . A two - tailed p - value of less than 0 . 05 was used for statistical significance .

BMI is calculated based on the patient’s most recent measurements of height in cm and weight in kg . Age was calculated based on the patient’s age at the most recent hospital visit . Races are self - reported . Residence is based on a Rural - Urban Continuum Code by the U . S . Department of Agriculture 36 . Area Deprivation Index 37 was used to measure patients ' socioeconomic status . Comorbidity was counted based on ICD - 10 codes . See Appendices for a complete list . ( * ) includes American Indian or Alaska Native , Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander , mixed race , and other uncategorized races . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Page 11 of 32 Figure 1 shows the flow diagram of patients and clinical outcomes . Between March 1st , 2020 , and December 1st , 2022 , data were available for 55 , 299 patients who tested positive for COVID - 19 . Table 1 summarizes the demographic and patient characteristics . A total of 55 , 299 patients tested COVID - 19 - positive and were included . A total of 17 , 580 patients were admitted to the hospital , while the remaining 37 , 719 were treated as outpatients . Among those patients admitted to the hospital , 2 , 856 were admitted to the ICU , and 1 , 038 patients proceeded with mechanical ventilation , while there were 462 mortalities . Only 21 . 5 % of all patients were of normal weight . 35 . 2 % were classified as overweight , and 42 . 8 % were obese . There is a rising percentage of patients in class 3 obesity with serious clinical outcomes ( 10 . 4 % overall , 11 . 3 % for hospitalization , 14 . 3 % for ICU admission , 17 . 1 % for mechanical ventilation , and 19 . 5 % for death ) . According to the age classification , older adults ( aged 60 – 69 , 70 – 79 , and > 80 ) have a higher risk of a poor clinical outcome . Females were more likely than males to test positive and be hospitalized . However , men were more likely to have a serious outcome . in terms of race . When compared to the white race , the Black or African American race is associated with a worse clinical outcome . The area deprivation index shows that the most deprived quarter of patients is associated with a worse clinical outcome . The most affluent quartile of patients was associated with a decreased rate of serious outcomes ( 7 . 4 % for overall , 7 . 6 % for hospitalization , 4 . 3 % for ICU admission , 3 . 3 % for mechanical ventilation , and 3 . 9 % for mortality ) . In terms of comorbidities , 42 . 1 % and 18 . 3 % of total patients were diagnosed with primary hypertension and diabetes , which constitute two common types of obesity - related comorbidities ; patients with primary hypertension and type 2 diabetes are more prevalent among those with serious COVID - 19 outcomes . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Page 12 of 32 We discovered an intriguing pattern in the difference in clinical outcomes between men and women . We further summarized the percentage of patients with clinical outcomes and comorbidities among different BMI categories , stratified by the sex factor . The results are shown in Figure 2 . The association between BMI category and clinical outcome ( Figure 2A ) shows that female patients have a higher hospitalization rate in all BMI categories in comparison with male patients . On the other hand , male patients have a significantly higher rate of ICU admission , mechanical ventilation , and mortality . In addition , Figure 2A shows that class 2 and class 3 obesity were associated with a significantly higher rate of hospitalization , ICU admission , mechanical ventilation , and mortality . From the association analysis between BMI category and comorbidities ( Figure 2B ) , the gender effect is clear . Among the normal , overweight , and patients with obesity groups , the rate of primary hypertension and type 2 diabetes was more prevalent among male patients than female patients . The male - female difference is not significant in secondary hypertension or type 1 diabetes . Also , regardless of sex , higher BMI categories are associated with a higher percentage of primary hypertension and type 2 diabetes . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Page 13 of 32 Figure 2 : Association between BMI categories , clinical outcomes , and comorbidities The left four charts listed four clinical outcomes and percentages . The associations between BMI and clinical outcomes were shown as differences in each BMI category . ( B ) The right four charts listed four comorbidities . The associations between BMI and comorbidities were shown as differences in each BMI category . The bars were further stratified by patients’ sex to further examine the difference between males and females . The error bars indicate an estimate of a standard deviation . The standard deviation is calculated by a binomial distribution based on the size N of each sub - population and the probability p for each percentage number . Following an analysis of the relationship between comorbidity and clinical outcomes in the patient cohort , obesity - related comorbidity shows as a risk factor for clinical outcomes . In Figure 3 , we further explored the association between comorbidity and BMI categories stratified by the sex factor . We observed that patients with comorbidity show a higher rate of hospitalization , ICU admission , mechanical ventilation , and mortality . Patients without comorbidities have a significantly lower risk of adverse outcomes . The comorbidity effect applies to both males and females . For male patients without comorbidity , the risk of hospitalization is significantly lower than for females without comorbidity , regardless of BMI . However , among serious outcomes , male patients show a significantly higher rate of ICU , mechanical ventilation , and mortality . Therefore , it can be concluded that male patients were less likely to be hospitalized J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Page 14 of 32 after testing positive than female patients . However , once hospitalized , male patients are associated with a higher rate of more severe symptoms than female patients and require further care . Figure 3 : Association between comorbidity and clinical outcomes The X axis indicates four clinical outcomes . The Y axis indicates six BMI categories , including underweight ( BMI < 18 ) , normal ( 18 - 24 . 9 ) , overweight ( 25 – 29 . 9 ) , obesity class 1 ( 30 - 34 . 9 ) , class 2 ( 35 – 39 . 9 ) , and class 3 ( BMI > 40 ) . For each chart , the left two bars show the percentage of corresponding outcomes from a BMI category , stratified by patient sex . The error bar indicates an estimate of a standard deviation . The standard deviation is calculated by a binomial distribution based on the size N of each sub - population and the probability p for each percentage number . It is known that obesity can lead to many comorbidities , such as hypertension and diabetes . However , the interactions between comorbidities and clinical outcomes were unknown . There is currently insufficient data to show that it is obesity , or obesity - related comorbidity that is associated with the increased risk of COVID - 19 clinical outcomes . To explore this issue , we designed Table 2 , which shows the three groups of logistic regression models that visualized the risk of clinical outcomes among different BMI J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Page 15 of 32 categories . Adjusted models can eliminate potential patient demographic and comorbidity factors , resulting in independent associations between obesity and clinical outcome risk . From table 2 , the underweight and overweight group shows a lower risk of hospitalization among the unadjusted , partly adjusted , and fully adjusted models . The odds of hospitalization were 1 . 14 ( 95 % CI : [ 1 . 08 , 1 . 20 ] ) , 1 . 19 [ 1 . 12 , 1 . 27 ] , and 1 . 15 [ 1 . 08 , 1 . 23 ] times higher than for class 1 , class 2 , and class 3 obesity compared to patients with a normal BMI . After adjusting the odds by demographic factors , the increased risk of hospitalization remains significant . After adjusting the odds by comorbidities , we observed that obesity without comorbidities did not show a significantly increased risk of hospitalization . The fully adjusted model indicates that obesity alone is not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization . This result clearly indicates that the comorbidity factors contribute significantly to the increased risk of hospitalization , ICU admission , mechanical ventilation , and death . Interestingly , the fully adjusted model shows that obesity without comorbidity is associated with a lower risk of ICU admission , mechanical ventilation , and mortality in comparison with patients of normal weight . It may indicate that a high BMI does not increase the risk of clinical outcomes , but obesity - related comorbidity is more likely to be associated with a high rate of worse outcomes . In terms of demographic factors , the small deviation between the unadjusted model and the demographic adjusted model shows that sex , age category , race , and ethnicity do not significantly increase or decrease the risk of clinical outcomes among all BMI groups .

The unadjusted model , partially adjusted model , and fully adjusted model show that demographics and BMI are not likely to be confounding variables in the association between comorbidity and hospitalization . After adjusting the model for demographic and BMI categories , patients with primary hypertension were 1 . 53 [ 1 . 46 , 1 . 60 ] times more likely to be admitted to the hospital , 3 . 39 [ 3 . 02 , 3 . 81 ] times more likely to be admitted to the ICU , 3 . 25 [ 2 . 69 , 3 . 93 ] times more likely to be on mechanical ventilation , and 1 . 66 [ 1 . 46 , 1 . 89 ] times more likely to die . Patients with type 2 diabetes were 1 . 33 [ 1 . 26 , 1 . 40 ] times more likely to be admitted to the hospital , 2 . 19 [ 2 . 00 , 2 . 40 ] times more likely to be admitted to the ICU , 2 . 30 [ 1 . 99 , 2 . 66 ] times more likely to be on mechanical ventilation , and 1 . 71 [ 1 . 54 , 1 . 90 ] times more likely to die . Therefore , obesity - related comorbidity is independently associated with an increased risk of clinical outcomes .

An unadjusted model uses BMI as a dependent variable and four clinical outcomes as predictors . The odds ratio estimates were further adjusted by demographic factors and comorbidities in the second and third columns . The odds ratio is scaled in logarithms on the y axis . Patients’ BMI was included in the logistic models on the x - axis . The solid lines are odds ratio estimates under different BMIs . The dashed lines represent the upper and lower 95 % confidence intervals of the estimates . A BMI of 25 . 0 kg / m2 was used as a reference BMI . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Page 20 of 32 To visualize the risk elevation among different BMI categories , we designed Figure 4 . showing a non - linear risk of clinical outcomes for patients with a different BMI . We discovered that a BMI of 25 . 0 kg / m2 was associated with the lowest overall risk of clinical outcomes following COVID - 19 infection . Increasing or decreasing BMI was associated with a slightly greater risk of hospitalization , ICU admission , mechanical ventilation , or death . Underweight people had a significantly higher risk of poor outcomes . From the comparison of the unadjusted and adjusted models , the increased risk of outcomes can be attributed to type 2 diabetes and hypertension among overweight and patients with obesity . For patients with a higher BMI and no comorbidities , the risk of adverse outcomes is not statistically higher than for patients with a reference BMI of 25 . 0 kg / m2 . The demographic factors , including different age categories , sex , race , and ethnicity , do not significantly change the estimated risks for different BMI categories . Discussion The prevalence of obesity is a major global challenge , especially with the COVID - 19 pandemic . Patients with obesity are at a higher risk of poor COVID - 19 outcomes . This study explored the association between obesity - related comorbidity and COVID - 19 adverse outcomes . This study identified that COVID - 19 + patients with obesity had significantly higher rates of adverse outcomes than COVID - 19 + patients without obesity in this cohort . Patients with obesity have a higher risk of hospitalization , ICU admission , mechanical ventilation , and mortality event onset . This finding supports a previous study ' s finding that obesity is a significant risk factor for COVID - 19 severity . We discovered a limitation of previous studies , which investigated the association between J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Page 21 of 32 obesity and COVID - 19 outcomes but did not consider obesity - related comorbidities as covariates . To segregate obesity - related comorbidity factors from obesity , we designed statistical models and demonstrated that obesity - related comorbidities are more accurate COVID - 19 outcome predictors than obesity . The adjusted logistic regression models demonstrated that primary hypertension and type 2 diabetes are independently associated with an increased risk of COVID - 19 severity . Therefore , our study significantly shows that obesity - related comorbidity is one of the more vital risk factors for COVID - 19 clinical outcomes . Comparison with other studies regarding the association between obesity , comorbidity , and adverse outcomes Our result that patients with a higher BMI have a higher risk of outcome is consistent with many comparable studies . For example , A cohort of 150 patients in an early - stage study conducted across three hospitals in China 15 showed a clear dose - effect relationship between increasing BMI values and the percentage of patients with severe COVID - 19 . Each 1 - unit increase in BMI was associated with a 12 % increase in the risk of severe COVID - 19 outcomes ( unadjusted OR 1 . 12 , 95 % CI 1 . 01 – 1 . 23 ) . The association was also observed after controlling for gender , age , and other comorbidities deemed relevant to the study . A meta - analysis 13 of 75 clinical association studies between COVID - 19 and obesity was performed . Obesity is associated with a higher risk of COVID - 19 adverse outcomes , including 46 . 0 % higher odds of testing positive ( OR = 1 . 46 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 30 - 1 . 65 ; p < 0 . 0001 ) , 113 % higher odds of hospitalization ( OR = 2 . 13 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 74 - 2 . 60 ; p < 0 . 0001 ) , 74 % higher odds of ICU admission ( OR = 1 . 74 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 46 - 2 . 08 , p < 0 . 001 ) . Considering the surging trend of individuals with obesity , it is critical to J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Page 22 of 32 understand how being an individual with obesity increases the risk for severe COVID - 19 . Such findings on the positive association between obesity and the risk of adverse outcomes are consistent with previous research . Several studies 7 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 15 , 16 used similar statistical models to associate obesity with severe COVID - 19 outcomes . According to a study conducted in New York City 9 , severe obesity ( BMI > 40 ) is a risk factor for hospitalization . The odds ratio of hospital admission was 2 . 5 for patients with obesity compared to patients without obesity . A study conducted in a French health center 11 discovered that the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation was 7 . 36 times higher for patients with obesity ( BMI > 35 ) than for patients in the healthy weight range ( BMI 18 - 25 ) . Similarly , a study conducted in a large academic hospital 16 found that the OR of ICU admission rate was 1 . 8 for patients with BMI 30 - 35 and 3 . 6 for patients with BMI > 35 when compared to patients with BMI 30 . Other research8 suggested a nonlinear relationship between BMI and COVID - 19 severity , with the lowest risks at BMIs near the healthy weight / overweight threshold in most cases and increasing with higher BMI . Other known risk factors for COVID - 19 and obesity include obesity being linked to impaired immune function 17 , 18 . Obesity decreases lung capacity reserve and can render ventilation more challenging 19 , which is linked with COVID - 19 severity . All findings demonstrated that the patient’s disease severity increased with BMI , and obesity is a direct risk factor for COVID - 19 severity . As the obesity rate increased from 30 . 5 % to 42 . 4 % from 1999 - 2000 through 2005 – 2008 3 in the United States , we suggest prioritizing therapy for patients with obesity and COVID - 19 infections to control life - threatening patient comorbidities . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Page 23 of 32 To date , the role of the comorbidity effect within this association is unknown . Our study explored the association between BMI and comorbidities , as well as the association between comorbidities and COVID - 19 severity . This study revealed that increasing BMI levels exacerbated the risk of primary hypertension . Elevated BMI levels increase the risk of Type 2 diabetes . These findings suggest that obesity - related comorbidities can play a larger role in COVID - 19 outcomes . In addition , hospitalized patients are more likely to suffer from hypertension and diabetes . A higher BMI is associated with an increased risk of hospitalization , ICU admission , mechanical ventilation , and death . Patients who have had a poor outcome are more likely to be obese . Consequently , comorbidity plays a significant role in mediating the relationship between obesity and COVID - 19 severity . We demonstrated in our model that obesity , in the form of comorbidities , contributes to the severity of COVID - 19 . When we excluded the comorbidity effect , simple obesity did not significantly increase the risk of hospitalization , ICU admission , mechanical ventilation , or death . Some viral infectious diseases , such as influenza and epidemiological diseases , provide insights into how obesity raises the risk of COVID - 19 severity . Other studies 12 , 13 , 15 have investigated the mechanisms of pulmonary , endocrine , and immune dysfunction in obese patients . These physiological effects can help direct future research and explain why a comorbidity has a greater impact than obesity alone . Consequently , these studies believe that individuals with severe obesity , particularly those with obesity - related comorbidities , should be considered a high - risk group for negative COVID - 19 outcomes . Logistic Regression Model : The demographic and comorbidity Effects J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Page 24 of 32 A drawback of previous studies is that they did not examine the potential confounding effects of obesity - related comorbidity variables . In this study , we completed the examination using three designed logistic regression models . These logistic regression models compare the probability of adverse outcomes from COVID - 19 with and without demographic and comorbidity risk factors . From Tables 2 and 3 , we clearly demonstrated that obesity - related comorbidities are independently associated with a higher risk of adverse outcomes after COVID - 19 infection . Regarding adverse outcomes of COVID - 19 , including hospitalization , ICU admission , mechanical ventilation , and mortality , the impact of primary hypertension was larger , with odds ratios of 1 . 53 , 3 . 39 , 3 . 25 , and 1 . 66 for hospitalization , ICU admission , mechanical ventilation , and mortality , respectively . Type 2 diabetes was also an independent risk factor for COVID - 19 outcomes , with odds ratios of 1 . 33 , 2 . 19 , 2 . 30 , and 1 . 71 for hospitalization , ICU admission , mechanical ventilation , and mortality . In addition , we did not observe that demographic factors , including age category , sex , and race , cause potential confounding effects in our model evaluation . An interesting observation was that BMI exhibited a lower impact when comorbidity factors and BMI factors coexisted within the model . The independent association between BMI and adverse outcomes was not significant . This suggested that obesity - related comorbidities were a stronger predictor of adverse outcomes than obesity alone within a multiple regression model . This result shows that obesity - related comorbidities are a higher risk factor for adverse outcomes than obesity alone . Comparison with other studies discussing obesity - related comorbidities J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Page 25 of 32 Obesity is a risk factor for co - morbidities , including primary hypertension and Type 2 diabetes 21 . Early COVID - 19 research 22 , 23 , 24 discovered that hypertension and diabetes mellitus are linked to a severe COVID - 19 clinical course and increased mortality . However , the early studies ' findings did not control for obesity as a correlated factor . For example , a review 25 summarized fifty - five clinical studies to determine the relationship between obesity , COVID - 19 severity , and comorbidities . Hypertension was a comorbidity in 31 of 55 studies , and diabetes was a comorbidity in 30 of 55 studies . Despite these studies frequently showing a positive correlation between obesity and COVID - 19 severity , they often ignored a variety of comorbidity factors . Since hypertension and diabetes are more prevalent in obese patients , the conclusion that obesity is a risk factor for the severity of COVID - 19 could be distorted by comorbidity factors , such as confounding variables . Consequently , to address this issue , Wang , Li , Lu , and Huang 26 conducted a pooled study on comorbidity factors and COVID - 19 severity risks , finding an OR of 2 . 29 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 69 – 3 . 10 , p < 0 . 001 ) for hypertension and 2 . 47 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 67 – 3 . 66 , p < 0 . 001 ) for diabetes . Since the six studies in this meta - analysis were not adjusted for BMI , they could favor the obese population and result in an overestimation of OR . Therefore , this study adjusted the model through BMI values , showing a slightly reduced OR for hypertension ( 1 . 63 from our results vs . 2 . 29 from the pooled study26 ) and diabetes ( 1 . 64 vs . 2 . 47 ) . Consequently , it is possible that the adverse effects of obesity are mediated in - part by hypertension and Type 2 diabetes . It is likely other types of obesity - related comorbidity factors could go undetected . These undetected comorbidity factors suggest possible clinical mechanisms for obesity ' s contributions to COVID - 19 severity . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Page 26 of 32 Study significance with recent variants / vaccinations The Delta variant was downgraded from a variant of concern to a variant being monitored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) in April 2022 27 . Although research in Scotland 28 and Canada 29 suggests that the Delta variant is associated with a higher risk of hospitalization , it is unclear whether the variant causes more severe disease in adults . In order to probe this query , the CDC ' s COVID - 19 - Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network examined trends in disease severity among 7615 COVID - 19 patients hospitalized between January 1st and August 20th , 2021 33 . The study found no difference in ICU admissions , the requirement for invasive mechanical ventilation , or mortality events between July and August of that year , while the Delta variant was not the dominant strain . The CDC concluded that the delta variant posed no significant public health risks . The Omicron ( B . 1 . 1 . 529 ) variant had a significantly higher contagious rate than the original strain of COVID - 19 , with the Delta variant occurring in both vaccinated and unvaccinated populations 35 . Fortunately , research 34 shows that Omicron has a lower rate of severe outcomes . Despite a population segment with severe outcomes being decreased 30 due to the increased coverage and effectiveness of recent COVID - 19 vaccines , the unvaccinated population is constantly at risk of serious illnesses 31 . Meanwhile , the absolute number of deaths remains high 32 . This study confirms the existence of two mediating effects for severe COVID - 19 outcomes : primary hypertension and type 2 diabetes . Therefore , such findings emphasize the importance of comorbidity - focused care . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Page 27 of 32 Clinical mechanisms : Pathways describing how comorbidity can drive COVID - 19 severity Comorbidity is a well - known risk recognized by health - care providers . Obesity ' s role in contributing to severe COVID - 19 can be pathologically justified 7 , 20 . Obesity , conversely , is a well - known risk factor for common chronic diseases such as diabetes , hypertension , and cardiovascular disease . Obese patients are more likely to develop chronic diseases , which may contribute to poor COVID - 19 outcomes . Excess ectopic fat , however , can have an impact on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems . The underlying impairments reduce the reserve and ability to deal with COVID - 19 infection , resulting in secondary immune reactions . Excess adipose tissue can enhance immune response . Consequently , an impaired metabolic response can result in severe COVID - 19 infection . Furthermore , an impaired immune response can result in respiratory dysregulation . The increased volume of inhalation can increase viral exposure through hyperventilation . Patients with obesity are frequently exposed to a basal inflammatory state , in terms of their immune systems . Inflammation can suppress the immune response and play a synergistic role in COVID - 19 severity . Admission to the ICU for patients with severe obesity ( BMI > 40 ) is frequently hampered , as patients with severe obesity are more challenging to ventilate , nurse , image , and rehabilitate , resulting in higher rates of mortality . When obesity progresses to a severe level , a patient is more likely to develop a comorbidity . Limitations This research has limitations . The study is based on a single clinical practice at Froedtert Health in Milwaukee , which may result in inaccurate measurements J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Page 28 of 32 influencing negative outcomes . This study solely probed hypertension and diabetes - related comorbidities . Additional research is required to confirm the impact of other obesity - related comorbidities . Selected patients’ rapid test results during the first few weeks of onset of COVID - 19 were not included , which could have cause underestimation of the COVID - 19 patient population . Smoking , performance status , laboratory results , COVID - 19 - directed treatment , or recent surgical procedures were not included as important risk factors . Furthermore , the novel COVID - 19 variants and vaccinations could significantly change the proportions of adverse outcomes . These risk factors could lead to potential biases in logistic regression models . Conclusion Obesity increases the risk of common comorbidities , and the increase in risk can be attributed to common comorbidities such as hypertension and Type 2 diabetes . This study demonstrated that comorbidity is an independent risk factor for COVID - 19 adverse outcomes . According to our models , obesity - related comorbidity is a more important risk factor for adverse outcomes than obesity alone . Patients with obesity - related comorbidities have significantly worse outcomes than patients with obesity alone . Obesity ' s association with comorbidities , and comorbidities ' association with worse outcomes , can justify why obesity is a significant risk factor for COVID - 19 prognosis . Our findings highlight the significance of care for patients suffering from obesity - related comorbidities . Consequently , it is critical to provide care for patients with obesity - related comorbidities during the pandemic to improve care quality .
