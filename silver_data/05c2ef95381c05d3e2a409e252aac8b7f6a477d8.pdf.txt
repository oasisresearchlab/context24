ABSTRACT Background : Superspreading infections play an important role in the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic . Superspreading is caused primarily by heterogeneity in social contact rates , and therefore represents an opportunity for targeting surveillance and control via consideration of social network topologies , particularly in resource - limited settings . Yet , it remains unclear how to implement such surveillance and control , espeically when network data is unavailable . Methods : We evaluated the efficiency of a testing strategy that targeted potential superspreading individuals based on their degree centrality on a social network compared to a random testing strategy in the context of low testing capacity . We simulated SARS - CoV - 2 dynamics on two contact networks from rural Madagascar and measured the epidemic duration , infection burden , and tests needed to end the epidemics . In addition , we examined the robustness of this approach when individuals ' true degree centralities were unknown and were instead estimated via readily - available socio - demographic variables . Findings : Targeted testing of potential superspreaders reduced the infection burden by 40 - 63 % at low testing capacities , while requiring between 45 - 78 % fewer tests compared to random testing . Further , targeted testing remained more efficient when the true network topology was unknown and prioritization was based on socio - demographic characteristics . Interpretation : Incorporating social network topology into epidemic control strategies is an effective public health strategy for health systems suffering from low testing capacity and can be implemented via socio - demographic proxies when social networks are unknown .

Both biological and social mechanisms contribute to this variation , driven by individual differences in host competence , viral transmission efficiency , and contact rates ( 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) . For SARS - CoV - 2 , social contact heterogeneity is the primary driver of the distribution pattern in secondary infections ( 7 ) . Variation in social contacts can be represented by a social network , yet public health authorities commonly lack the data needed for social network - based surveillance . However , some socio - demographic variables predict connectivity on social networks and may therefore be useful proxies for the risk of superspreading . Because superspreader infections contribute disproportionately to transmission chains , they also provide an opportunity for targeted public health interventions ( 8 , 9 ) , particularly in contexts where surveillance and testing resources are limited . As early as April 2020 , the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called attention to the lack of SARS - CoV - 2 diagnostics in the region ( 10 ) . Indeed , serological surveys from multiple countries revealed infection burdens much higher than those predicted based on case - based surveillance , an indication of underdiagnosis of COVID - 19 cases by diagnostic systems ( 11 – 13 ) . Testing is an integral part of the COVID - 19 responses of sub - Saharan African countries ( 14 ) , and the lack of adequate testing capacity can impede public health efforts . One way to mediate the limitation of low testing capacity is by using prioritized testing schemes , such as schemes that prioritize testing of only symptomatic individuals or testing of close contacts of known cases ( 15 ) . Testing schemes that take into account social contact heterogeneity on a social network ( e . g . network topology ) could prioritize testing of potential superspreaders , such as highly connected individuals , and may slow community transmission using fewer tests than non - prioritized schemes . As such , they are a potential pathway to epidemic control in the face of limited testing capacities . Here , we use epidemic simulations on empirical and simulated social networks to investigate the effectiveness of targeted testing of highly connected ( e . g . potentially superspreading ) individuals to control an epidemic when testing capacity and social network information is limited . We simulate SARS - CoV - 2 outbreaks on two close - contact social networks derived from social and spatial movement data on individuals living in rural communities in the Sambava district of the SAVA region 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 .

We then compare the effectiveness of testing strategies that target superspreaders to those that test randomly using the full knowledge of the social network , evaluating the time needed to control the epidemic , the total infection burden , and number of tests needed . Finally , we repeat the simulations using socio - demographic variables from the study population to identify potential superspreaders , thus investigating whether these commonly available data are suitable proxies for hetereogeneity in transmission . METHODS Social contact networks We modeled SARS - CoV - 2 dynamics using a susceptible - exposed - infected - recovered ( SEIR ) model simulated across undirected networks where each individual was represented explicitly as a node in the network and their contacts by edges . Importantly , we modeled epidemics on an empirical social network , rather than a simulated one , to ensure our results were most relevant to settings with limited testing capacities . Empirical contact networks contain unique network topologies that may be lacking from simulated networks and more accurately represent the true social structure of a population , with important consequences for disease transmission ( 17 ) . However , half of all empirical social contact networks used in epidemic modeling are derived from European contexts ( 18 ) , where SARS - CoV - 2 testing capacities are relatively high . To ensure our results were most relevant to settings with limited testing capacities , we simulated epidemics on two contact networks obtained from rural communities in a low - income country where testing capacities are currently limited . The social contact networks were constructed using survey and GPS tracker data of consenting adults ( over 18 years of age ) living in two villages in the SAVA region of northeastern Madagascar . The first village , Mandena ( 14°28 ' 36″ S 47°48 ' 50″ E ) , as described by Kauffman et al . ( 16 ) , has approximately 2700 people ( based on census data from local authorities ) . The second village , Sarahandrano ( 14°36’27’’ S 49°38’50’’ ) , is home to approximately 900 people . Data collection occurred over 7 weeks in Mandena and over 3 separate sampling periods , ranging from 5 to 8 weeks each over a 9 - month time period , in Sarahandrano . Subjects participated in a social network survey that asked for information on individuals with whom they have regular contact or supportive social relationships . These social surveys were used for recruitment of additional 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 .

Subjects ( n = 123 and 321 , respectively ) were provided with a GPS tracker programmed to record a location every three minutes to wear for at least one week . Participants wore the GPS for at least one week , with a subset of individuals agreeing to wear a new , freshly charged GPS for additional weeks ( n = 76 ; 61 . 8 % and n = 154 ; 48 . 0 % for Mandena and Sarahandrano , respectively ) . The close - contact networks were then imputed to account for individuals wearing GPS trackers in different weeks of the study . Edges in the network represent the probability a dyad came into close contact and the predicted proportion of 3 minute - periods of close - contact between dyads over the number of possible contacts in one week ( details in supplement ) . We included edges with a weight above a threshold value equal to at least one hour of contact during the week , resulting in final network sizes of 120 and 318 for the Mandena and Sarahandrano networks , respectively . In order to create a time - integrated network , we rescaled the weight so that a value of 1 corresponded to 24 hours in contact over the course of the week . SEIR Model At each time step , equivalent to one day , an individual could become susceptible , exposed , infected ( symptomatic and asymptomatic ) , or recovered ( Fig . S2 . 1 ) . A susceptible individual’s probability of becoming exposed is a function of how many infected contacts they are connected to on the network and their transmission rates ( see Supplementary Materials for full specification ) . They then moved through exposed and infected compartments following time - dependent transition rates , and remained recovered until the end of the simulation . Time - dependent transition rates more accurately describe SARS - CoV - 2 epidemic dynamics than memoryless transition rates , which assume transition rates are independent of the time spent in the compartment ( 20 ) . Therefore , we relaxed the memoryless assumption of all transition rates , and parameterized the model so that the latent period followed a gamma distribution with a mean of 6 . 5 days ( sd 2 . 6 ) ( 21 ) and the mean recovery period followed a gamma distribution with a mean of 3 . 2 days ( sd 4 . 3 ) ( 22 ) ( Fig . S2 . 2 ) . We assumed thirty percent ( 30 % ) of infected individuals were asymptomatic ( 23 ) , and that asymptomatic individuals had a transmission rate equal to 30 % of the transmission rate ) of symptomatic individuals ( 𝛽) of symptomatic individuals  ( 24 ) . The transmission rate ) was parameterized to approximate an epidemic that resulted in an effective ( 𝛽) of symptomatic individuals  reproduction number of 4 . 54 ( Fig . S2 . 3 ) , and a range of rates are explored in the supplement .

These exposed individuals thus started the simulation on the first day of their latent period . The number of susceptible , exposed , infected ( asymptomatic and symptomatic ) , and recovered individuals were recorded at each time step . Epidemics were simulated until no exposed or infected individuals remained , which we define as the full duration of the epidemic . Evaluating Control Strategies We considered two different testing strategies . One strategy targeted potential superspreaders . In this strategy , individuals were tested in order of descending degree centrality ( e . g . the number of nodes they are connected to ) ; hence , the most well - connected individuals were tested first . The other strategy tested individuals randomly , without consideration of network topology . We only considered passive surveillance , which tests infected , symptomatic individuals . Testing took place at the end of each simulated time - step ( daily ) , after individuals had gone through transitions at that time step . Infected individuals that were positively identified via testing were quarantined by moving them immediately to the recovered class , where they no longer contributed to transmission . While SARS - CoV - 2 re - infection is possible , we did not include this possibility given the short duration of our epidemics relative to immune waning ( 25 ) . In addition to two testing strategies , we considered low and high testing capacities , corresponding to monthly testing capacities of 25 % and 100 % of the total population . To account for imperfect surveillance , symptomatic individuals that were identified to be tested had a 0 . 75 probability of being successfully contacted and tested . Testing began on day 21 of all simulations . All strategies , including a control of no testing , were simulated 1000 times . We evaluated each strategy and testing capacity combination based on how efficiently it controlled the epidemic , defined as the time and resources spent until no infected or exposed individuals remained . We used three metrics to evaluate the outcomes : the duration of the epidemic , the cumulative number of infected individuals per capita , and the number of tests used to control the epidemic . We assessed each strategy and testing capacity based on its ability to reduce the infection burden and the length of the epidemic while minimizing the tests needed .

We compared the efficiency of the two different control strategies via the same measures used in the main analysis . Further details on these methods and results are reported in the Supplemental Materials . Applying Control Strategies to Networks with Unknown Topologies To examine the applicability of these strategies to real - world scenarios , we compared the effectiveness of the two strategies when applied to a population where the true degree distribution is unknown and identification of potential superspreaders is derived from common socio - demographic variables . First , we fit a statistical model to predict each individual’s degree percentile in their respective network using the following socio - demographic variables : age , gender , household size , marital status ( single vs . cohabiting / married ) , and schooling level ( none , primary , secondary , higher ) . The model was fit exploring all potential main effects of socio - demographic variables and interactions with gender . A final model was obtained by model averaging all models within 4 AIC units of the top model ( 26 ) . The full details of model fitting are described in the Supplemental Materials . Using this model , we predicted an estimated degree percentile for each individual in the two networks . These predicted degree percentiles were then used to rank individuals by their degree centrality and these rankings were used to prioritize testing in the targeted strategy . All other aspects of the simulations ( e . g . transmission dynamics , control strategies ) remained unchanged . We then compared the efficiency of the two control strategies on known and unknown network topologies , where testing was prioritized based on individuals’ true and statistically - estimated degrees , respectively .

RESULTS Madagascar Social Network Topology The social networks from rural Madagascar had characteristics of networks where superspreading is likely to occur . The Mandena network contained 120 nodes and 4136 total edges , with a mean node degree of 34 . 47 and normal degree distribution . However , the distribution of edge weights was strongly left - skewed . The mean edge - weight was 0 . 18 , but less than two percent of edges had a weight above 1 ( equal to 24 hours over a week - long period ) . The majority of edge weights were below 0 . 05 , equivalent to 80 minutes of close contact a week . The Sarahandrano network contained 318 nodes and 16140 total edges , with a mean node degree of 50 . 7 and a normal degree distribution . Like the Mandena network , the distribution of edge weights was strongly left - skewed , but degree centrality was overall higher than on the Mandena network . The mean edge - weight was 0 . 31 , with 614 edges , or 3 . 8 % , having a weight above 1 . Fifty - percent of edge - weights were below 0 . 08 . Control Efficiency The targeted strategy had the largest effect on reducing daily incidence the most while using the fewest tests , particularly at a 25 % testing capacity ( Fig . 1 , Fig . 2 ) . An uncontrolled epidemic , with no testing , resulted in a median of 0 . 71 infections per capita on the Mandena network and 0 . 91 infections per capita on the Sarahandrano network ( Table 1 , Fig . 2 ) . In contrast , at a monthly testing capacity of 25 % , targeting highly connected individuals resulted in a median of 0 . 17 and 0 . 40 new infections per capita on the Mandena and Sarahandrano networks , respectively ( Table 1 , Fig . 2 ) . The infection burden decreased with increasing testing capacity for both control strategies , but the random testing strategy was most sensitive to an increase in testing capacity , while the targeted strategy used a similar number of tests across all testing capacities ( Table 1 , Fig . 2 ) . Testing was more efficient when targeting highly connected individuals on both networks , requiring less than a quarter of the number of tests needed when testing randomly on the Mandena 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 .

This was equivalent to 40 tests when testing randomly and 9 tests with targeted testing on the Mandena network and 127 tests when testing randomly and 69 tests with targeted testing on the Sarahandrano network . Targeted testing only shortened the epidemic length on the Mandena network ( Table 1 , Fig . 2 ) , where it was able to stop transmission chains earlier in the epidemic than random testing ( Fig . 1 , Fig . 3 ) . On the Sarahandrano network , random testing flattened the epidemic curve by reducing the number of infections , but this did prolong the epidemic by preventing rapid spread through the population as in the no testing strategy ( Fig . 1 , Fig . 2 ) Visualizing a simulated SEIR epidemic on the Mandena network illustrates how each strategy works at a fine scale ( Fig . 3 ) . The strategy of no control allowed for the highest infection burden , including individuals with low centrality who were infected later in the epidemic than in other strategies . Testing randomly did stop some transmission chains , but transmission continued later into the epidemic than targeted testing , with the highest daily incidence of four cases on day 74 of the epidemic . In contrast , targeted testing slowed transmission by halting transmission chains that would result in a high number of secondary infections ( Fig . 3 ) ; daily incidence never rose above two cases and the last transmission event was on day 40 . Across all three categories of the sensitivity analyses , targeted testing remained the most efficient strategy ( Fig . S2 . 1 - S2 . 5 ) . This difference was most pronounced at low capacities when testing began earlier in the epidemic and at intermediate to high transmission rates . However , even when testing began on day 40 , the targeted strategy reduced the infection burden by over 0 . 10 infections per capita relative to random testing ( Fig . S2 . 1 ) . The relative efficiency of targeted testing was highest at high transmission rates ( Fig . S2 . 3 ) . Our results were not sensitive to network size or assortativity rates . Further sensitivity analysis results are reported in the Supplementary Materials . Applying Control Strategies to Networks with Unknown Topologies A model including socio - demographic variables did a poor job of predicting degree percentile across the two networks ( R 2 = 0 . 03 ) . However , the model was able to rank individuals by degree centrality ( Mandena Spearman’s ρ = 0 . 15 ( p = 0 . 09 ) ; Sarahandrano Spearman’s ρ = 0 . 18 ( p = 0 . 002 ) ) . The model was able to distinguish high - degree individuals from low - degree individuals : the top ten individuals in each network had a predicted degree that was on average approximately twice as high 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 .

S3 . 3 ) . Marital status was the only variable included in all models within 4 AIC units of the top model , but all socio - demographic variables were included in the averaged model . Specifically , cohabiting individuals had lower degree centrality than single individuals . Further details are reported in the Supplementary Materials . Despite the poor predictive capacity of degree percentile , the predictions based on socio - demographic variables performed remarkably well in the targeted testing strategies . Indeed , testing based on socio - demographically predicted centrality was as effective as using centralities obtained from a social network ( Fig . 4 ) . The infection burden was slightly higher when using estimated degree centralities to target testing , particularly on the Sarahandrano network , but it remained lower than strategies of no testing and testing randomly . Although socio - demographic characteristics were not strong predictors of absolute degree centrality values , we found that their ability to differentiate between very high and low connected individuals was enough to successfully implement a control strategy that considers network topology . DISCUSSION In the face of global diagnostic and vaccine inequity , many countries are tasked with developing novel public health interventions that optimize limited diagnostic capacities to control the SARS - CoV - 2 epidemic . Given the role of superspreading infections in community transmission of SARS - Cov - 2 , we explored whether control strategies that consider social network topologies , specifically individuals’ degree centrality , could limit disease spread while using fewer resources than current , non - prioritized testing strategies . We found that strategies that target well - connected , infected individuals are the most effective , reducing epidemic duration and overall infection burden , particularly at low testing capacities . In fact , in simulations on empirical social contact networks from rural Madagascar , targeted testing reduced the infection burden and shortened the epidemic even at a testing capacity of only one test per day , equivalent to a monthly testing capacity of 25 % of the population . These strategies were robust even when identification of superspreaders was imperfect due to unknown network topologies and based solely on socio - demographic variables . This study demonstrates the benefit of considering social network topology in data - driven epidemic control strategies . We find that strategies that prioritize testing highly - connected individuals offer the most benefit in contexts with low testing capacities . In our simulations , this is achieved by controlling the epidemic 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 .

However , even when the start of testing is delayed by 30 days , the targeted strategy reduces the epidemic length by nearly one month and the infection burden by 0 . 10 infections per capita ( Fig . S4 . 1 ) . Early , aggressive testing has been used to successfully control the epidemic in several countries ( South Korea : ( 27 ) , New Zealand : ( 28 ) ) , and a similar mechanism explains why strategies that target highly connected individuals are so efficient in our simulations . Although delayed testing did result in higher infection burdens for all control strategies , targeted testing remained the most efficient strategy because of its ability to halt the epidemic quickly , even when begun later in the epidemic . At the national or continental scale , it is hypothesized that relatively low connectivity between rural communities may slow the epidemic pace of SARS - CoV - 2 in sub - Saharan Africa compared to the US or Europe ( 29 ) . However , at the community - scale , such as those portrayed in our empirical networks , connectivity between individuals was high . Therefore , at this scale , epidemics may spread rapidly following an initial introduction , and implementing measures quickly are key to limiting infections . Notably , at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 , many African countries implemented control measures more quickly than European countries ( 30 ) , effectively limiting spread during the first wave of the epidemic . Our simulations show that implementing targeted testing strategies at the beginning of local epidemics similarly reduces disease burdens . While the concept of developing a disease control strategy configured by a social network is not novel ( 31 – 33 ) , this study is one of the few that explicitly considers limited testing capacities on par with those in low - income countries . Madagascar tested 26 , 425 individuals ( less than 0 . 01 % of the total population ) between March - September 2020 ( 34 ) , only a fraction of the testing capacity required by mass - testing campaigns that have been implemented elsewhere ( e . g . Slovakia , ( 35 ) ) . This is further complicated by the relative remoteness of some communities , with more than 50 % of the population living further than two hours from a hospital ( 36 ) . In both Mandena and Sarahandrano , for example , no SARS - CoV - 2 testing has been available to date . While cost and physical access to testing are significant barriers to disease control in Madagascar ( 37 ) , our findings suggest that , if and when testing is available to rural communities , targeted testing can mitigate the negative impact of limited testing capacity on epidemic control . For example , antigen - based testing is relatively low - cost , does not require refrigeration , provides instant results , and could be implemented at a local scale via outreach teams of skilled health workers ( 14 ) . However , in order for prioritized testing schemes such 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 302 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 316 317 318 .

Another novel aspect of our study is the consideration of demographic predictors of network centrality to guide targeted testing . In practice , social network data is rarely available and implementing testing based on degree is unfeasible when network topologies are unknown . However , we show that estimated measures of degree centrality based on common socio - demographic variables perform as well as “true” degree centrality when used to prioritize testing schemes . Health authorities can implement superspreader - targeted control strategies by taking into account easy to measure individual characteristics ( e . g . age , gender , household size , marital status ) , many of which are available in healthcare and governmental records , or can be quickly generated through surveys . The exact socio - demographic variables to include will vary depending on local demographics and cultural practices , and will require input from local experts . However , we found that even imperfect models can inform prioritization strategies if they are able to differentiate the most connected from the least connected individuals , demonstrating that integrating social network topologies into control strategies is therefore both effective and feasible . Our social networks represented realistic , but necessarily simplified versions of true social networks . For example , we assumed social contacts were static and did not change , either as a result of dynamic social behavior ( 39 ) , or changes in behavior due to the epidemic ( e . g . social distancing ) . However , our simulations were relatively short , lasting less than three months on average , and static networks have been successfully used to model rapid epidemics , such as SARS - CoV - 1 ( 40 ) . Our social networks necessarily only included individuals over 18 years old , who represent less than 50 % of the population nationally . Although contact patterns may differ for individuals under 18 years old , our sensitivity analyses found that the targeted strategy was most effective for a variety of network topologies , suggesting these results will hold when applied to the full network of all ages . In addition , the small size of our networks ( 120 and 318 ) meant that epidemics were short and highly influenced by stochasticity , which we attempted to control for by simulating 1000 epidemics with different initial conditions . By using empirical social contact networks , we included realistic social network topologies that more accurately represent exposure risk in rural Madagascar than simulated networks or networks based on studies from the Global North , where the majority of social networks originate from . A recent meta - analysis found only four social contact studies , less than 7 % of those included in 319 320 321 322 323 324 325 326 327 328 329 330 331 332 333 334 335 336 337 338 339 340 341 342 343 344 345 346 347 348 .

We included two social networks from rural Madagascar in our study and found that superspreader - targeted testing reduced infection burdens on both networks relative to random testing , suggesting our findings may be generalizable to other rural communities elsewhere . In addition , our sensitivity analyses demonstrated that our results are robust to network size and assortativity , and therefore may apply to a variety of social network topologies . Expanding social network data collection outside of the Global North would allow for more realistic and context - specific estimates of disease dynamics on social networks globally . Incorporating social network topology into SARS - CoV - 2 interventions greatly increases the efficiency of control strategies under limiting testing capacities . Prioritized testing of highly - connected individuals shortens the length of the epidemic while reducing the infection burden . These control strategies are effective even when the true network topology is unknown and potential superspreaders are identified using only common socio - demographic variables . Incorporating a similar strategy could aid countries with limited diagnostic resources to manage the SARS - CoV - 2 epidemic within their communities . Importantly , this study focused on testing to control the epidemic at the population level , and assumes that diagnostics are not tied to treatment . SARS - CoV - 2 control strategies should be adapted according to a country’s public health policy to ensure that vulnerable populations do not lose access to diagnostics and treatment . While our study focused on SARS - CoV - 2 , testing strategies that consider network topology may be useful for other diseases with similar transmission pathways , particularly when superspreaders drive transmission . This simulation approach could be easily re - parameterized to characterize different diseases of interest . As social contact network data becomes more widely available , considering social network topology is a promising method for allocating limited resources during public health crises .
