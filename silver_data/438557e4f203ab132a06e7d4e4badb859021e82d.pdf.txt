Dispatch R49 Clathrin uncoating : Auxilin comes to life Sandra K . Lemmon The DnaJ protein auxilin has been extensively studied in vitro as a cofactor for uncoating clathrin - coated vesicles by the chaperone Hsc70 . Recent studies provide the first evidence that auxilin plays this role in vivo , and work on a new mammalian auxilin suggests the protein may have more complex cellular functions .

Clathrin is well known for its roles in vesicle formation at the plasma membrane during endocytosis , and in the sorting of proteins in the trans - Golgi network for delivery to the endosomal system . The formation of clathrin - coated vesicles is a complex process involving an array of accessory and regulatory proteins [ 1 ] . In animal cells , the AP - 1 and AP - 2 adaptor proteins capture membrane cargo into clathrin - coated vesicles , while assembly of the clathrin triskelion — with its three heavy and three light chains — into polyhedral lattices is thought to drive mem - brane deformation during budding ( Figure 1 ) . Once fission of the vesicle has occurred , the clathrin coat must be rapidly shed to enable fusion of the vesicle with its target membrane and recycle coat components for further rounds of vesicle budding . Extensive in vitro studies have indicated that uncoating of clathrin is mediated by the molecular chaperone Hsc70 and a DnaJ cofactor known as auxilin [ 2 – 4 ] . Until recently there were hints , but no proof , that these factors serve this function in vivo ( [ 5 , 6 ] for example ) . Now three new studies [ 7 – 9 ] , one published recently in Current Biology [ 7 ] , have provided the first con - clusive evidence that auxilin is required for clathrin recy - cling in cells . Auxilin 1 is a brain - specific protein that , on the basis of its carboxy - terminal J domain , is included in the DnaJ family of chaperone cofactors ( Figure 2a ) . Other DnaJ proteins have been shown to act cooperatively with molecular chaperones of the heat - shock protein 70 ( Hsp70 ) family , and auxilin 1 interacts via its carboxy - terminal J domain specifically with the Hsp70 family member Hsc70 . Auxilin 1 also has an amino - terminal segment related to the tumor suppressor gene product PTEN and the actin - binding protein tensin , and a clathrin - binding domain . A second auxilin , auxilin 2 , is expressed more broadly and was identified as cyclin G - associated kinase ( GAK ) , although the significance of this interaction is still not understood Figure 1 The clathrin - coated vesicle cycle . Adaptor proteins ( APs ) bind to the membrane , capturing receptor cargo , and clathrin assembles driving invagination of the vesicle . After budding , auxilin recruits Hsc70 to the vesicle for uncoating of clathrin . This step may be regulated by activation of the phosphoinositide phosphatase activity of synaptojanin , which may involve interaction with endophilin’s SH3 domain . Adaptor protein release also seems to be mediated by Hsc70 , but requires an additional cytosolic factor ( s ) . Hsc70 may remain associated with triskelions to prime them for reassembly into lattices .

In addition to the regions of the protein that are similar in sequence to auxilin 1 , GAK / auxilin 2 has an amino - terminal serine / threonine kinase domain ( Figure 2a ) . Only the clathrin - binding and DnaJ regions of the two auxilins , however , are required for uncoating activity in vitro [ 4 , 6 , 12 ] . According to current models , auxilin binds assembled clathrin , recruits ATP - activated Hsc70 via its J domain , and stimulates the chaperone’s ATPase activity [ 4 , 13 ] . Hsc70 then disrupts clathrin – clathrin interactions , leading to release of the clathrin coat . Hsc70 remains bound to disassembled clathrin and may prime triskelions for reassembly [ 13 ] ( Figure 1 ) , while auxilin is recycled and promotes multiple rounds of uncoating . More recent studies , using dominant - negative mutant forms of Hsc70 , support the view that Hsc70 has a role in regulating clathrin disassembly and the clathrin - coated - vesicle cycle in intact cells ( S . Newmeyer and S . Schmid , personal com - munication ) . But what about auxilin ? Two studies [ 7 , 9 ] supporting the inference from the in vitro experiments that auxilin cooperates with Hsc70 in vivo to promote uncoating have been carried out with budding yeast , Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Graham and colleagues [ 7 , 14 ] identified yeast auxilin , which they call Swa2p , in a genetic screen designed to find factors required for ADP - ribosylation factor ( ARF ) - dependent pathways . ARF is a small GTP - binding protein involved in recruitment of AP - 1 and coatomer ( COPI ) to Golgi membranes [ 15 ] . Clathrin - mediated vesicular transport was implicated early on in their screen , as swa5 turned out to be an allele of the clathrin heavy chain gene CHC1 [ 14 ] . The most notable feature of Swa2p is its carboxy - terminal DnaJ domain , which has greatest sequence similarity — approximately 40 % identity — to the J domains of animal auxilins ( Figure 2 ) . This suggested that Swa2p might be the yeast clathrin uncoating factor . This same sequence similarity was also recognized in an analysis of the yeast genome sequence by Pichvaee et al . [ 9 ] , who refer to the gene as AUX1 . Swa2p / Aux1p has no other homology to auxilin or GAK , although it does contain a tetratricopep - tide repeat ( TPR ) region ( Figure 2 ) , other cases of which have been shown to facilitate protein interactions with Hsc chaperones . The DnaJ domain homology spurred both groups [ 7 , 9 ] on to determine whether Swa2p / Aux1p really is a yeast auxilin . Indeed , Swa2p / Aux1p has an amino - terminal clathrin - binding domain [ 7 , 9 ] , and stimulates the ATPase activity of yeast Hsc70 in vitro [ 7 ] . Furthermore , Swa2p / Aux1p can recruit mammalian Hsc70 to pre - assem - bled bovine clathrin baskets , co - assemble with clathrin into coats and stimulate efficient Hsc70 - dependent depolymerization of clathrin lattices [ 9 ] . These results indicate that Swa2p / Aux1p has the in vitro biochemical properties of auxilin . The two groups [ 7 , 9 ] next tested whether the yeast auxilin - like protein plays a role in uncoating of clathrin in vivo , by generating Swa2p / Aux1p - deficient yeast . They found [ 7 , 9 ] that loss of auxilin results in a phenotype similar to that caused by clathrin deficiency : slowed growth , delayed endocytic delivery to the vacuole of the aa - factor receptor Ste3p , and inefficient maturation of the vacuolar protein carboxypeptidase Y , which is normally sorted from the trans - Golgi network to the vacuole .

This phenotype is a hallmark of a clathrin defect , which causes the escape of trans - Golgi network membrane proteins to the cell surface in yeast . Auxilin - deficient cells were found [ 7 , 9 ] also to exhibit a major loss of triskelia from the cytosol , and to have signifi - cantly more membrane - associated or assembled clathrin than normal cells . The absence of auxilin was associated with a significant shift of clathrin , the Golgi clathrin adaptor protein AP - 1 , and the cargo proteins pro - carboxypeptidase Y and Ste3p into clathrin - coated vesicle fractions [ 9 ] . Finally , 50 – 100 nm vesicles coated with clathrin were found to accumulate in auxilin - depleted , but not in normal cells [ 9 ] , further supporting the conclusion that auxilin has a role in the uncoating of clathrin in vivo . Evidence that auxilin has a similar function in a metazoan organism has been obtained by Greener et al . [ 8 ] , who identified an auxilin homologue , CeAUX , of the nema - tode worm Caenorhabditis elegans ( Figure 2 ) . This group used RNA - mediated interference ( RNAi ) to reduce the auxilin level in vivo . They found that internalization of a yolk protein into growing oocytes was severely perturbed in the auxilin - deficient worms , and progeny arrested development during early larval stages . Many somatic cell types producing a form of clathrin heavy chain tagged with the green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) displayed increased punctate fluorescence , perhaps reflecting increased associ - ation of clathrin with vesicles or membranes ; alternatively , the auxilin defect might have caused a compensatory increase in the level of clathrin expression . Indeed the production of GFP – clathrin from a transgene appeared to increase the ability of auxilin - deficient larvae to survive past early stages , suggesting that overproduction of clathrin might compensate for the inability to recycle clathrin efficiently . The conclusion that auxilin deficiency affects clathrin recycling was further supported by analysis using the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) technique : fluorescent GFP – clathrin puncta in cells from auxilin - deficient animals showed little recovery after photobleaching , compared to wild - type worms . Now that in vitro observations of clathrin uncoating by auxilin / Hsc70 has been validated by in vivo evidence , a number of questions remain . First , how is uncoating regulated ? What prevents premature lattice release prior to fission of the coated vesicle from the membrane ? The clathrin light chain might be involved , as suggested in earlier studies , even though it is not required for uncoat - ing in vitro [ 3 ] . Perhaps vesicle acidification upon pinch - ing off from the membrane serves as a switch for uncoating . Another possibility is that phosphorylation regulates the uncoating process in vivo . Kinases are known to be associated with clathrin - coated vesicles ( [ 16 ] , for example ) , and both yeast and mammalian aux - ilins are heavily phosphorylated [ 7 , 16 ] . The kinase domain in GAK / auxilin 2 might play some regulatory role in coat disassembly . Phosphorylation of the large subunits of the adaptor proteins AP - 1 and AP - 2 decreases their affinity for clathrin [ 17 ] , and the consequent reduction in the interactions between the adaptor proteins and clathrin ‘legs’ could shift the equilibrium in favour of lattice disassembly . It seems unlikely , however , that the kinase domain of GAK has this regulatory role , as it exhibits no kinase activity towards the AP - 1 and AP - 2 large chains in vitro [ 6 ] . Synaptojanin 1 , a polyphosphoinositide phosphatase that acts on the phosphoinositide lipids PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , has been implicated as a potential regulator of clathrin - coated vesicle uncoating in vivo . Synaptojanin is highly enriched in synapses and binds to a number of pro - teins involved in endocytosis [ 1 ] . Recent studies [ 18 , 19 ] have shown that synaptojanin 1 knockout mice and C . elegans unc - 26 synaptojanin mutants have increased numbers of clathrin - coated vesicles in nerve endings , consistent with a defect in uncoating after synaptic vesicle endocytosis . Endophilin , a protein with a Src homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain that binds synaptojanin , may also be important for clathrin uncoating , as inhibition of endophilin – synaptojanin interaction in vivo also leads to accumulation of clathrin - coated vesicles in the synapse [ 20 ] . Mutation of Inp53p , one of three yeast synaptojanins , was found to exacerbate the trans - Golgi network defects caused by a temperature - sensitive mutation of clathrin heavy chain [ 21 ] , though it is not yet known whether this leads to accumulation of clathrin - coated vesicles . Finally , the mammalian auxilin domain related to PTEN is intriguing as , like synaptojanin , PTEN is a phosphoinosi - tide phosphatase [ 22 ] . Auxilin lacks amino acids required for phosphatase activity , but binding of phosphoinositides might directly regulate auxilin function . Another important issue is the mechanism by which the heterotetrameric adaptor proteins , AP - 1 and AP - 2 , dissoci - ate from clathrin - coated vesicles once the outer triskelion lattice has disassembled . The adaptor protein shell would still present a barrier for subsequent vesicle fusion , and adaptor proteins would need to be recycled for further rounds of clathrin - coated vesicle formation ( Figure 1 ) . Mammalian and yeast auxilins contain ‘DPF’ motifs ( Figure 2 ) , which are known to bind to the appendage domain of the AP - 2 α chain and , as predicted , GAK and auxilin 1 interact [ 6 , 23 ] . Uncoating of clathrin by Hsc70 and brain auxilin , however , does not remove adaptor proteins from coated vesicles in vitro ( [ 24 ] , for example ) . Nor does overproduction of auxilin 2 in cells , which leads to aggrega - tion of clathrin in the cytosol but does not perturb AP - 2 Dispatch R51 localization [ 6 ] . As GAK can phosphorylate adaptor protein µ chains [ 6 ] , which bind directly to receptor cargo , it may regulate adaptor protein disassembly by releasing this inter - action . Might auxilin have other cellular functions ? In non - neuronal cells , GAK / auxilin 2 is found in association with clathrin - coated structures , primarily the trans - Golgi network , but a significant proportion of GAK colocalizes with actin focal adhesions , possibly mediated by its tensin domain [ 12 ] . The clathrin - coated vesicles that accumulate in synaptojanin - deficient mice are found suspended in an actin - rich matrix in the endocytic zone of the nerve synapse [ 18 ] . Although this could be a result of pleiotrophic effects of synaptojanin deficiency , auxilin might tether clathrin - coated vesicles to actin , or even be involved in regulating disassembly of the actin cytoskele - ton , which might be required for uncoating or movement of the vesicle into the cell . While the targets of the kinase domain of GAK are not known , two GAK kinase domain homologues , Prk1 and Ark1p , are important for organiza - tion of cortical actin patches and endocytosis in yeast [ 25 , 26 ] . Identification of the substrates of auxilin 2 / GAK’s kinase activity should illuminate the importance of these connections to the actin cytoskeleton , and will be an active area of future research as ‘auxilin comes to life’ .
