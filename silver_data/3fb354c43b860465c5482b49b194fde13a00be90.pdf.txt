The Journal of Clinical Investigation R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E 4 3 5 9 jci . org Volume 128 Number 10 October 2018 Introduction Chronic myeloproliferative neoplasia ( CMN ) is a malignant hema - topoietic disease characterized by excessive proliferation of one or more myeloid cell lineages as erythrocytes , platelets , or leuko - cytes . CMN comprises several sub - entities , including polycythe - mia vera ( PV ) , essential thrombocytosis ( ET ) , primary myelofi - brosis ( PMF ) , and others . Genomic analysis of CMN revealed an activating somatic point mutation of the JAK2 gene ( JAK2 - V617F ) in the majority ( 95 % ) of PV patients and in 50 % of ET and PMF patients , respectively ( 1 – 3 ) . JAK2 - V617F – mutated CMN ( PV , ET , and PMF ) is driven by clonal proliferation of myeloid cells . Patients may develop an inflammatory syndrome consisting of fever , night sweats , and elevated serum proinflammatory cyto - kine levels ( 4 , 5 ) . Clinical studies using JAK kinase inhibitors have shown improvement of splenomegaly , systemic inflammatory symptoms , and overall survival ( 4 – 6 ) . Venous and arterial throm - bosis is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in PV and ET patients ( 7 , 8 ) . Strikingly , the thrombotic risk in these patients is dramatically higher than in patients with secondary erythrocyto - sis or thrombocytosis . This indicates that disease - intrinsic factors play a major role . Indeed , it has been reported that JAK2 - V617F leads to abnormal function of erythrocytes and platelets ( 9 , 10 ) . Aberrant single - cell cytokine secretion ( 11 ) and elevated α M inte - grin CD11b expression have been described in circulating gran - ulocytes in PV , ET , and MF patients ( 12 – 14 ) . Recently , our group has demonstrated that JAK2 - V617F activates β 1 integrin – mediated adhesion of granulocytes isolated from CMN patients to vascu - lar cell adhesion molecule 1 ( VCAM1 ) ( 15 ) . VCAM1 is expressed on venous endothelial cells and acts in leukocyte – endothelial cell adhesion ( 16 , 17 ) . However , the functional role of leukocyte inte - grins in the pathophysiology of JAK2 - V617F – positive disease , in particular thrombosis and formation of splenomegaly , is still poor - ly defined . There is a large body of evidence showing that activa - tion of integrins on leukocytes , in particular of β 1 and β 2 integrins , is fundamental to the process of leukocyte adhesion , migration , JAK2 - V617F – positive chronic myeloproliferative neoplasia ( CMN ) commonly displays dysfunction of integrins and adhesion molecules expressed on platelets , erythrocytes , and leukocytes . However , the mechanism by which the 2 major leukocyte integrin chains , β 1 and β 2 , may contribute to CMN pathophysiology remained unclear . β 1 ( α 4 β 1 ; VLA - 4 ) and β 2 ( α L β 2 ; LFA - 1 ) integrins are essential regulators for attachment of leukocytes to endothelial cells . We here showed enhanced adhesion of granulocytes from mice with JAK2 - V617F knockin ( JAK2 + / VF mice ) to vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 – ( VCAM1 - ) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 – coated ( ICAM1 - coated ) surfaces . Soluble VCAM1 and ICAM1 ligand binding assays revealed increased affinity of β 1 and β 2 integrins for their respective ligands . For β 1 integrins , this correlated with a structural change from the low - to the high - affinity conformation induced by JAK2 - V617F . JAK2 - V617F triggered constitutive activation of the integrin inside - out signaling molecule Rap1 , resulting in translocation toward the cell membrane . Employing a venous thrombosis model , we demonstrated that neutralizing anti – VLA - 4 and anti – β 2 integrin antibodies suppress pathologic thrombosis as observed in JAK2 + / VF mice . In addition , aberrant homing of JAK2 + / VF leukocytes to the spleen was inhibited by neutralizing anti - β 2 antibodies and by pharmacologic inhibition of Rap1 . Thus , our findings identified cross - talk between JAK2 - V617F and integrin activation promoting pathologic thrombosis and abnormal trafficking of leukocytes to the spleen .

We hypothesized that abnormal function of integrins on leukocytes , in particular neutrophils , may induce abnormal leukocyte - endothe - lium interaction and thus may contribute to pathologic thrombosis in CMN . In addition , abnormal trafficking of hematopoietic pro - genitors from bone marrow into the bloodstream and abnormal homing of hematopoietic cells including leukocytes to the spleen have been described as a prominent feature of JAK2 - V617F – posi - tive CMN ( 4 , 5 , 31 – 35 ) . Using in vitro and in vivo experimentation , we sought to elucidate the role of abnormal β 1 / β 2 integrin activi - ty in the JAK2 - V617F kinase – induced prothrombotic state and in aberrant homing of leukocytes to the spleen . Results Expression levels of β 1 and β 2 integrins in the hematopoietic system of JAK2 + / VF mice . To investigate the effects of physiological JAK2 - V617F expression on β 1 and β 2 integrin abundance , we used a JAK2 - V617F – knockin mouse CMN model ( 36 ) . Floxed heterozy - gous JAK2 - V617F ( JAK2 + / floxP - VF - floxP ) mice were crossed with trans - genic VavCre mice ( JAK2 + / VF ) , resulting in JAK2 - V617F protein expression in hematopoiesis . The resulting phenotype is charac - terized by an elevated hematocrit and WBC count , splenomegaly , and prominent splenic extramedullary hematopoiesis ( Supple - mental Figure 1 , A – C ; supplemental material available online with this article ; https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1172 / JCI90312DS1 ) , closely corre - sponding to data published earlier ( 36 ) and resembling human PV . Expression levels of the 2 most prominent leukocyte integrins , β 1 and β 2 , were analyzed in the myeloid and lymphoid compart - ments of the bone marrow of JAK2 + / + ( Cre + ) and JAK2 + / VF ( Cre + ) mice . β 1 ( CD29 ) integrin expression was unchanged in granulo - cytes of JAK2 + / VF compared with JAK2 + / + mice , corroborating previ - ously published results in human granulocytes isolated from JAK2 - and inflammation ( 18 – 23 ) . Two major integrin β - chains , β 1 and β 2 , are expressed on leukocytes , forming either VLA - 4 ( very late antigen – 4 ) or LFA - 1 ( lymphocyte function – associated antigen – 1 ) ( 19 ) . Unstimulated , VLA - 4 and LFA - 1 harbor a closed , inactive conformation , but in response to external stimuli ( e . g . , chemok - ines such as SDF1 α ) these integrins rapidly undergo a conforma - tional change . This enhances both the affinity and the avidity for their natural ligands , VCAM1 or intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ( ICAM1 ) , which are typically expressed on endothelial cells and on cells of the immune system ( 24 ) . The intracellular signaling pro - cesses controlling integrin activation are known as inside - out sig - naling ( 19 ) and include PI3K , phospholipase C ( PLC ) , calcium dia - cylglycerol guanine nucleotide exchange factors ( CalDAG - GEFs ) , small GTPases such as Rap1 , adhesion - and degranulation - pro - moting adaptor protein ( ADAP ) , and others . It has long been suggested that leukocytosis is a potential thrombotic risk factor in PV and ET patients ( 8 ) . The proposed pathophysiological mechanism includes abnormal interaction of leukocytes , especially neutrophils with platelets and endothelial cells ( 8 , 25 , 26 ) . In PV and ET patients , markers of increased basal activation of neutrophils have been detected , including elevated expression of CD11b and increased levels of neutrophil proteases in the plasma , both of which exert prothrombotic activity ( 13 , 26 – 28 ) . The contribution of neutrophils to pathological venous throm - bosis has been appreciated only recently , but is now recognized as being crucial for thrombus initiation and progression ( 29 ) . Forma - tion of neutrophil extracellular traps ( NETs ) contributes to coag - ulation and platelet aggregation ( 29 , 30 ) . In a model of deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) applying partial ligation of the inferior vena cava ( IVC ) , within only 1 hour of depressed venous blood flow , leu - kocytes started to roll along , adhere , or crawl on the venous endo - thelium ( 30 ) . β 1 and β 2 integrins are essential in mediating rolling and firm adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelial layer , trans - Figure 1 . β 1 and β 2 integrin expres - sion in the myeloid and lymphoid compartments of the bone marrow of JAK2 + / + and JAK2 + / VF mice .

To analyze the conformation status of β 1 integrins on granulocytes in JAK2 + / VF and JAK2 + / + mice , we test - ed 9EG7 antibody binding ( Figure 2E ) . We found that JAK2 + / VF granulocytes showed increased binding of 9EG7 antibody , indicating that β 1 integrins have shifted from the bent , low - affinity status to an open , high - affin - ity conformation . Having demonstrated that β 1 and β 2 integrin activ - ity is increased in JAK2 + / VF granulocytes , we evaluat - ed inside - out signaling of integrins . Rap1 - GTPase was recently identified to be constitutively activated in JAK2 - V617F – positive human granulocytes and direct - ly involved in activation of β 1 integrins ( 15 ) . Analysis of JAK2 + / + and JAK2 + / VF granulocytes confirmed increased activation of Rap1 in JAK2 - V617F – mutated mice ( Figure 3A ) . In contrast , in granulocytes of calreticulin - mutated ( CALR - mutated ) patients , Rap1 was activated to a minor degree only as compared with cells from JAK2 - V617F – positive patients ( Supplemental Figure 3A ) . This also applies to ERK phosphorylation in the presence of CALR mutation ( Supplemental Figure 3B ) . To define the bio - logical significance of this observation requires further investigation in a larger number of patients . However , it is tempting to speculate that differential ERK signaling and differential RAP1 activation may result in reduced β 1 / β 2 integrin activation in CALR - mutated granulocytes . Interestingly , in view of the proposed role of β 1 / β 2 inte - grin activation in thrombosis described below , the thrombotic risk in CALR - mutated ET patients was reported to be markedly reduced in comparison to those with JAK2 - V617F – positive ET ( 37 ) . A large body of evidence from T cell studies suggests that acti - vation of Rap1 - GTP in control of β 1 integrin function is associated with translocation of the protein to the plasma membrane ( 38 ) . To investigate whether JAK2 - V617F kinase causes membrane relo - calization of Rap1 , we employed the 32D myeloid progenitor cell model ectopically expressing the erythropoietin receptor ( Epo - R ) and either JAK - WT or JAK2 - V617F mutant ( 15 , 39 ) . Previously , we demonstrated that 32D JAK2 - V617F cells display a strong increase in static adhesion to immobilized VCAM1 ( the ligand for β 1 integ - rin VLA - 4 ) but not to immobilized BSA ( 15 ) . The presence of the mutated JAK2 compared with the JAK2 - WT molecule in 32D cells resulted in increased localization of Rap1 in cytoplasm and trans - location toward cortical actin ( Figure 3B and Supplemental Figure 4 ) . Plasma membrane isolation ( Figure 3C ) confirmed that consti - tutive activation of Rap1 in JAK2 - V617F – mutated cells was indeed associated with translocation to the plasma membrane . Incubation with the geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitor GGTI - 2147 , which blocks posttranslational modifications of Rap1 required for acti - vation and translocation to the plasma membrane ( 40 ) , revealed a strong decrease in static adhesion on VCAM1 of JAK2 + / VF gran - ulocytes , while JAK2 + / + granulocytes were largely unaffected ( Fig - ure 3D ) . This suggests that posttranslational processing of Rap1 is required for JAK2 - V617F – induced integrin activation . JAK2 - V617F – induced Rap1 activation is mediated by PI3K and CalDAG - GEFI . Downstream of JAK2 kinase , PI3K and MAPK V617F – positive patients ( 15 ) . Interestingly , in monocytes , T cells , and B cells , expression of β 1 integrins was upregulated , with the effect most prominent in monocytes ( Figure 1A ) , indicating a dif - ferential regulatory mechanism of β 1 integrin expression in these cell types . In parallel , the expression levels of β 2 integrins ( CD18 ) were found to be increased in granulocytes , monocytes , and T cells but not in B cells ( Figure 1B ) . In a transplantation model wherein retrovirally transduced bone marrow cells expressing either JAK2 - WT or JAK2 - V617F were injected into lethally irradiated BALB / c mice , CD29 expression was unchanged in granulocytes , while CD18 expression was upregulated in the JAK2 - V617F background ( our unpublished observations ) , confirming the results obtained in the VavCre - JAK2 - V617F knockin mouse model . β 1 and β 2 integrin activity is enhanced in primary murine JAK2 + / VF granulocytes and is dependent on Rap1 - GTPase activity . Recently , we showed that human granulocytes from JAK2 - V617F – positive patients have increased adhesion on a surface coated with the β 1 integrin ligand VCAM1 ( 15 ) . Using primary granulocytes isolated from the bone marrow of JAK2 + / + or JAK2 + / VF mice , we performed static adhesion assays on VCAM1 or ICAM1 ( ligand for β 2 integ - rins ) . Increased adhesion of JAK2 + / VF granulocytes was detect - ed on VCAM1 as well as on ICAM1 ( Figure 2 , A and B ) . Soluble ligand binding assays for VCAM1 ( sVCAM1 ) and ICAM1 ( sICAM1 ) revealed increased binding to JAK2 + / VF granulocytes as compared with JAK2 + / + cells ( Figure 2 , C and D ) . In addition , employing overexpression of JAK2 - WT or JAK2 - V617F in a Ba / F3 cell recon - stitution model confirmed increased static adhesion on VCAM1 and ICAM1 of JAK2 - V617F cells ( Supplemental Figure 2 , A and B ) .

Neutrophils , monocytes , and platelets cooperate to initiate and propagate venous thrombosis in mice in vivo ( 30 ) . Interestingly , neutrophils constitute the major leukocyte subset and play a dominant role during the early phase of venous thrombosis ( 30 ) . Blood flow restriction triggers the rapid attach - ment and accumulation of neutrophils and monocytes to the endo - thelium , which is crucial for development of thrombosis ( 30 ) . The process of neutrophil attachment to the endothelium and plate - let - neutrophil interaction is predominantly mediated by selectin and integrin activation ( 16 , 45 , 46 ) . Endothelial cells express the β 1 and β 2 integrin ligands ICAM1 and VCAM1 , which are particu - larly abundant under inflamed conditions ( 16 , 47 , 48 ) . To investi - gate whether inflammatory cytokines , which are commonly ele - vated in JAK2 - V617F – induced disease , may modulate ICAM1 and VCAM1 expression , we tested HUVECs in response to TNF - α and IL - 6 stimulation using flow cytometry . Strong upregulation of both ICAM1 and VCAM1 was detected in TNF - α – stimulated cells ( Figure 5A ) , whereas IL - 6 appeared to selectively induce ICAM1 expres - sion ( our unpublished observations ) . Of note , expression of E - and P - selectins was not affected by TNF - α and IL - 6 ( our unpublished observation ) . Thus , we hypothesized that in JAK2 - V617F – induced disease increased ICAM1 and VCAM1 expression on endothelial cells in combination with abnormal β 1 and β 2 activity may precip - itate abnormal adhesion of granulocytes to endothelial cells , con - tributing to pathologic thrombus formation . To study the role of β 1 and β 2 integrins in this process , we employed a widely used throm - bosis model of the IVC ( 49 ) . We induced thrombosis in JAK2 + / + and JAK2 + / VF mice by partial ligation of the IVC and 4 hours thereafter analyzed thrombus size and dry weight of the thrombi ( Figure 5B ) . are activated , resulting in increased proliferation of JAK2 - V671F – mutated cells ( 41 ) . JAK + / VF granulocytes preincubated with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin showed reduced adhesion on VCAM1 com - pared with JAK2 + / + granulocytes ( Figure 3D ) . This result was con - firmed in 32D JAK2 - V617F cells incubated with wortmannin ( Fig - ure 4A ) and LY294002 ( Figure 4B ) . Of note , in 32D JAK2 - WT cells , adhesion on VCAM1 upon wortmannin treatment was only slightly reduced , and it was unchanged upon LY294002 treatment ( Fig - ure 4 , A and B ) . LY294002 - treated 32D JAK - V617F cells revealed reduced levels of active Rap1 - GTP ( Figure 4C ) , confirming an involvement of PI3K in the activation pathway of Rap1 . However , it appears that Akt is not involved , since direct blockade of Akt by Akt inhibitor VIII did not alter adhesion or Rap1 activation ( Figure 4D ) . For efficient conversion of Rap1 - GDP to Rap - GTP , guanine exchange factors such as Epac , C3G , or CalDAG - GEFI are required ( 42 – 44 ) . The incubation of JAK2 + / VF granulocytes with the Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + chelator BAPTA / AM resulted in reduced adhesion to VCAM1 in comparison to JAK2 + / + granulocytes ( Figure 3D ) . The results were confirmed in 32D JAK2 - V617F and JAK2 - WT cells ( Figure 4E ) , suggesting a Ca 2 + - dependent activation pathway . Since CalDAG - GEFI is a Ca 2 + - dependent enzyme , knockdown of CalDAG - GEFI using shRNA was performed in 32D JAK2 - V617F cells . Adhesion to VCAM1 was reduced , albeit to a minor degree ( Figure 4 , F and G ) . Together , these results suggest that PI3K and CalDAG - GEFI signaling contribute to Rap1 activation and to increased adhesiveness of JAK2 - V617F – positive cells .

Spleen microenvironment and interaction with integrin ligands VCAM1 and ICAM1 . In JAK2 + / VF mice , development of CMN - like dis - ease goes along with formation of splenomegaly and with effacement of the normal architecture of the spleen ( 34 , 51 ) . In order to analyze the changes in structure and cellular composition of JAK2 + / + and JAK2 + / VF spleens , we employed multi - epitope ligand cartography ( MELC ) . This includes an analysis of VCAM1 and ICAM1 , which are known to be expressed in the spleen ( 50 , 51 ) . Using this sequential automated multiparameter microscopy approach ( 52 ) , we were able to charac - terize splenic architecture as well as cellular distributions and inter - actions by spatially resolved marker phenotypes ( Figure 6 , A – F ; and A significant increase in thrombus size and dry weight was observed in JAK2 + / VF as compared with JAK2 + / + mice , confirming previous reports on accelerated thrombosis in JAK2 - V617F mice ( 50 ) . Next , we determined the relative contribution of β 1 and β 2 integrin activity to JAK2 - V617F – induced thrombus formation . JAK2 + / VF mice were i . v . injected either with a combination of blocking antibodies against VLA - 4 and β 2 integrins or with the corresponding isotype controls ( Figure 5C ) . JAK2 + / VF mice treated with VLA - 4 / β 2 integrin blocking antibodies showed dramatically reduced thrombus dry weight and size as compared with isotype control – injected JAK2 + / VF mice . Thus , upon VLA - 4 / β 2 integrin blockade , JAK2 + / VF mice displayed throm - bus weight and size similar to those observed in JAK2 + / + mice with - out VLA - 4 / β 2 integrin blockade .

A massive effacement of the typical JAK2 + / + structure divided into red pulp , white pulp , and marginal zone was detected in JAK2 + / VF spleens . However , for comparability of MELC results between JAK2 + / + and JAK2 + / VF , we specifically searched for fields of view that presented residual white pulp structures ( Fig - ure 6A ) . Analysis for VCAM1 and ICAM1 revealed strong expres - sion in JAK2 + / + as well as in JAK2 + / VF spleens ( Figure 6B ) , although expression levels of both VCAM1 and ICAM1 were decreased in the red pulp of JAK2 + / VF mice but increased in the white pulp and mar - ginal zone ( Figure 6C ) . In line with the disturbed splenic architecture and with the trend toward higher ICAM1 and VCAM1 expression in the white pulp , we found that the strict segregation of neutrophils almost exclusively located in the red pulp in JAK2 + / + mice was lost in the JAK2 + / VF animals , with the neutrophil density decreased in the red pulp and strongly increased in the white pulp ( Figure 6 , D and E ; and Supplemental Figure 5A ) . In order to determine changes in the interaction of myeloid cells with VCAM1 and ICAM1 , we employed a small object segregation approach by which the marker expression in proximity of VCAM1 and ICAM1 could be quantified ( Supplemental Fig - ure 5B ) . We found that the signal of CD11b in objects with direct contact to both VCAM1 and ICAM1 was significantly increased in the white pulp of JAK2 + / VF mice ( Figure 6F ) , indicating preferential binding of neutrophils to VCAM1 and ICAM1 . Taken together , these data suggest that in addition to increased integrin activation in granulocytes , changes in splenic structure and disturbed expression of VCAM1 and ICAM1 might contribute to the altered distribution of these cells in the spleen . Activated β 1 and β 2 integrins of JAK2 - V617F – positive granulocytes stimulate abnormal traffick - ing to the spleen in vivo . In JAK2 - V617F – positive disease in mice and humans , abnormal accumu - lation of mature myeloid cells characterized by expression of Gr - 1 and CD11b and extramedul - lary granulopoiesis within the splenic cords has been observed ( 31 , 34 ) . Because MELC analysis demonstrated disturbed expression of VCAM1 and ICAM1 and altered distribution of gran - ulocytes , we hypothesized that trafficking of myeloid cells into the spleen might be affected . Therefore , in vivo cell tracking was performed using whole - body single - photon emission computed tomography ( SPECT ) ( Figure 7A ) . 111 Indium - labeled whole bone marrow ( WBM ) cells of JAK2 + / VF or JAK2 + / + mice ( 3 × 10 6 cells for each replicate ) were injected into JAK2 + / + recipients , and the distribution in the body was measured after 1 hour and 18 hours . In the early SPECT images obtained 1 hour after injection of JAK2 + / VF or JAK2 + / + cells , 111 indium was found predominantly in the blood pool ( our unpub - lished observations ) , whereas after 18 hours the greatest 111 indium activity was found in liver and spleen . Interestingly , the amounts of 111 indium in spleen were substantially greater in mice injected with JAK2 + / VF cells ( Figure 7A , left panel ) . Standardized uptake values for the spleen were 15 . 1 for mice injected with JAK2 + / VF cells and 9 . 7 for JAK2 + / + cells ( Figure 7A , right panel ) . To investigate which cell types preferentially home to the spleen , we injected WBM cells obtained from JAK2 + / + or JAK2 + / VF mice ( carrying the congenic marker CD45 . 2 ) into CD45 . 1 recipients , and after 16 hours we analyzed the CD45 . 2 - positive cell population in spleens .

No differences could be observed in homing to the bone marrow ( Supplemental Figure 6A ) . Integrins LFA - 1 and VLA - 4 together with chemokine receptor signaling mediate homing of leukocytes to the spleen ( 53 ) . Therefore , bone marrow cells of JAK2 + / VF mice were preincubated with a β 2 integrin block - ing antibody or the corresponding isotype control before injection into CD45 . 1 recipients . This analysis revealed a reduced number of granulocytes and monocytes in the spleen ( Figure 7C ) . In a stroke model , we have previously observed that neutrophil migration to the brain is dependent on VLA - 4 ( 54 ) . To investigate whether the increased homing ability correlates with constitutive activation of Rap1 , we preincubated the bone marrow cells with the Rap1 inhib - itor GGTI - 2147 before injection into recipient mice . Inhibition of Rap1 suppressed abnormal splenic homing of injected JAK2 - V617F – positive granulocytes and monocytes in vivo ( Figure 7D ) without having an apparent effect on cell survival ( Supplemental Figure 6B ) . This finding is in line with studies highlighting that Rap1 activation and membrane relocalization are essential for β 1 integrin activation ( 38 ) . Together the results suggest that increased β 1 and β 2 integrin activity drives abnormal trafficking and homing of granulocytes and monocytes to the spleen . Discussion As an initial approach to investigate the role of β 1 and β 2 integrins on leukocytes in CMN , we analyzed integrin expression in various leukocyte subsets isolated from JAK2 + / VF knockin mice harboring physiologic expression of JAK2 - V617F . Abundance of β integrins on the cell membrane among various leukocyte subsets was found to be differentially affected by JAK2 - V617F . While β 1 integrin ( CD29 ) expression in mouse and human ( 15 ) granulocytes was unchanged in the presence of JAK2 - V617F , expression of β 2 integrins ( CD18 ) was upregulated . These data are consistent with results of cDNA expression studies performed in granulocytes from JAK2 - V617F – positive patients ( 55 ) . Monocytes and T cells from JAK2 + / VF knock - Figure 6 .

Our findings are consistent with data suggesting a role for JAK2 in chemokine - induced Rap1 activation and integrin - mediated adhe - sion ( 58 ) . Interestingly , excessive activation of Rap1 in a knockout model of SPA - 1 showed development of a myeloproliferative - like disease and extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen ( 59 ) , indi - cating an important role of Rap1 in initiation of the disease . Here we show that Rap1 activation in granulocytes is regulated by PI3K and CalDAG - GEFI activity . In ET , dysfunction of PI3K / Rap1 and of α IIb β 3 integrins results in hyperactivity of platelets ( 60 ) . Further - more , it was demonstrated that expression levels of CalDAG - GEFI correlate with β 3 integrin activation in megakaryocytes ( 61 ) . In T cells , it was shown that CalDAG - GEFI and Rap1 regulate activation of LFA - 1 , whereas VLA - 4 is activated by PLC and the PKC signaling pathway ( 62 ) . In line with our results , Rap1 as well as β 1 and β 2 integ - rin activation are impaired in CalDAG - GEF – / – neutrophils ( 63 ) . Cal - DAG - GEFI deficiency blocked adhesion to venules and migration into inflamed tissue and suppressed arterial thrombus formation in mice ( 63 ) . Thus , PI3K and CalDAG - GEFI have been proposed as possible targets for future antithrombotic therapies ( 64 , 65 ) block - ing integrin activation of granulocytes and platelets . in mice displayed considerably higher membrane expression lev - els of both ICAM1 and VCAM1 in comparison to their counterparts isolated from JAK2 + / + mice . Interestingly , single - cell expression profiling recently revealed that β 1 and β 2 integrins are subjects of regulation by JAK2 - V617F at the level of hematopoietic stem cells in a murine model ( 56 ) . As a functional consequence , upregula - tion of membrane expression may facilitate spontaneous and / or chemokine - induced clustering of integrins . Regulation of integrin activation by chemokines / cytokines has been shown to depend on a plethora of inside - out signaling mol - ecules ( 18 , 19 ) . Among the best - studied mechanisms is signaling via the small GTPases Rap1 and Rho . Rap1 activation and static adhesion on VCAM1 and ICAM1 are strongly enhanced in granu - locytes from JAK2 + / VF mice , confirming results obtained previous - ly in human granulocytes from JAK2 - V617F – positive patients and in 32D cells overexpressing JAK2 - V617F ( 15 ) . Recently , it has been demonstrated that signaling pathways of STAT3 , STAT5 , Akt , and ERK are constitutively activated by CALR mutations ( 57 ) . However , we found no increase in Rap1 activation or ERK phosphorylation in CALR - positive human granulocytes as compared with JAK2 - V617F – positive granulocytes . Thus , apparently , CALR - mutated cells Figure 7 . Increased adhesiveness and homing capacity to the spleen of primary JAK2 + / VF murine myeloid cells .

Granulocyte trafficking between blood and tissue is primarily driven by selectins and integrins and their ligands expressed in tissue ( 69 ) . Using MELC technology , we demonstrated high expression of VCAM1 and ICAM1 in splenic tissues from JAK2 + / + and JAK2 + / VF mice . As compared with other cells types , the numbers of JAK2 - V617F – positive neutrophils were strongly increased in the white pulp of JAK2 + / VF mice and revealed enhanced binding to VCAM1 and ICAM1 . In conclusion , our data show that JAK2 - V617F activates intra - cellular signaling of β 1 and β 2 integrins in leukocytes . Our results have potentially broad implications , as they show that blocking integrin activation suppresses pathologic thrombus formation in a JAK2 - V617F – positive mouse model . Thus , modulation of VLA - 4 and LFA - 1 integrin activity may constitute a potential future ther - apeutic approach for thrombosis in CMN patients refractory to standard treatment . Methods Mouse models . JAK2 + / VF mice were provided by Ann Mullally ( Divi - sion of Hematology , Department of Medicine , Brigham and Wom - en’s Hospital , Harvard Medical School , Boston , Massachusetts , USA ) and have been characterized in detail ( 36 ) . Floxed heterozy - gous JAK2 + / floxP - VF - floxP animals were crossed with Vav - 1 - Cre trans - genic mice ( The Jackson Laboratory ) ( 70 ) to induce hematopoietic JAK2 - V617F expression starting during mouse embryogenesis . To rule out any secondary effects of Cre recombinase , JAK2 + / + ( Cre + ) and JAK2 + / VF ( Cre + ) mice were VavCre positive . Cre - mediated excision was verified by PCR using primers GACCAGTTGCTC - CAGGGTTA , GCAAAGGGAGACAAGAAACGT , and TCACAAG - CATTTGGTTTTGAAT . Blood was collected into EDTA - coated containers and analyzed on an ADVIA 2120 ( Siemens Healthcare ) . Cell culture . Murine promyeloid 32D cells ( Leibniz Institute DMSZ – German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures ) or Ba / F3 pro - B cells ( ATCC ) were stably transfected with EpoR and either JAK2 - WT or JAK2 - V617F and were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 % FBS and 25 U / ml penicillin / streptomycin . For starvation , cells were cultured for 4 hours in serum - reduced ( 0 . 5 % ) medium at a density of 1 × 10 6 cells / ml . Starved cells were treated with GGTI - 2147 ( 10 μ M , 30 minutes ) , PI3K inhibitor LY294002 ( 25 μ M , 3 hours ) or wortmannin ( 10 nM , 30 minutes ) , Akt inhibitor VIII ( 0 . 5 μ M ; 4 hours ) , BAPTA / AM ( 10 μ M ; 1 hour ) . HUVECs ( PromoCell ) were cultivated with EndoPAN 3 medium ( PAN Biotech ) supplemented with 3 % FBS , 10 nM l - glutamine , 0 . 75 U / ml heparin , 5 ng / ml hr - EGF , 5 ng / ml hFGF - 2 , 5 ng / ml VEGF , 50 μ g / ml ascorbic acid sulphate , 15 ng / ml hr - IGF - 1 . Cells were seeded into 6 - well plates and stimulated for 24 hours with 1 , 5 , and 10 ng / ml human TNF - α . Expression of VCAM1 ( CD106 ; clone 51 - 10C9 , BD Biosciences , catalog 555647 ) and ICAM1 ( CD54 ; clone HA58 , BD Bioscience , catalog 559771 ) was evaluated by flow cytometry . Median fluorescence intensity ( MFI ) ratio was calculated using MFI of specific antibody staining sub - tracted by MFI of the corresponding isotype control . RNAi . For knockdown of CalDAG - GEFI , the pLKO . 1 vector system with a puromycin resistance gene containing one shRNA sequence for CalDAG - GEFI ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was used . To generate lentiviral parti - cles , HEK293T cells ( Leibniz Institute DMSZ – German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures ) were transfected using FuGENE HD Transfection Reagent ( Promega ) . The knockdown efficiency was assessed by immunoblotting . Despite recent advances in understanding the pathophysiology of JAK2 - V617F – induced CMN , the precise molecular mechanism that triggers the marked prothrombotic state — the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with PV and ET — remains elusive ( 25 ) . Interestingly , in elegant studies wherein FeCl 3 was used to occlude the carotid artery , tissue - specific expression of JAK2 - V617F in megakaryocytes , and thus in platelets , failed to result in significant differences in occlusion time between WT and Pf4 - Cre / FF1 mice ( 25 ) . Moreover , membrane expression of integrin β 3 , α IIb , β 1 , and α 2 was unchanged in resting platelets , and no significant dif - ferences were observed in the activity of the platelets as tested by P - selectin expression and activated α IIb β 3 levels ( 25 ) . These results point to a minor role of platelets in JAK2 - V617F – induced patholog - ic thrombus formation . The reticulocyte / erythrocyte compartment of JAK2 + / + and JAK2 + / VF mice expresses very low levels of CD29 ( VLA - 4 ) and of CD18 ( LFA - 1 ) , which are barely detectable and apparently unchanged in JAK2 + / VF mice ( our unpublished obser - vations ) . Thus , this finding argues against a major role of β 1 and β 2 integrins expressed on erythrocytes when inhibiting VLA - 4 / β 2 but points to the involvement of granulocytes and monocytes . Indeed in a recently published article , granulocytes were identified to play a pivotal role in venous thrombus formation in JAK2 - V617F – knock - in mice ( 66 ) , supporting our finding that neutrophils are the major player in JAK2 - V617F – driven thrombosis . The mechanism involved is increased formation of NETs ( 66 , 67 ) . Thus , that finding and the results presented here point to a scenario wherein increased Rap1 activation induced by JAK2 - V617F results in increased adhesion of granulocytes to the endothelium , which in turn releases NETs , there - by triggering increased thrombus formation . The occurrence of extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen of JAK2 - V617F – positive CMN patients is associated with abnormal trafficking of hematopoietic cells , including clonal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells . Our results employing SPECT analy - sis of 111 indium - labeled bone marrow cells isolated from JAK2 + / VF mice show preferential binding of JAK2 - V617F – positive hema - topoietic cells to splenic structures . Recently , it has been shown that macrophages retain hematopoietic stem cells in the spleen via VCAM1 ( 68 ) , providing a potential molecular mechanism operat - ing in our model . Transplantation of CD45 . 2 - positive bone mar - row into CD45 . 1 recipient mice revealed that mature granulocytes and monocytes are clearly involved , albeit at low numbers . How - ever , the follow - up time applied in our experiments was short ( 16 hours ) , and the cumulative nature of leukocyte trafficking to the spleen over time may translate into higher cell numbers . Never - theless , there was a clear signal that granulocytes and monocytes from JAK2 + / VF mice have an advantage in homing to the spleen , which is sensitive to β 2 integrin neutralization and to Rap1 inhibi - tion by GGTI - 2147 . Abnormal interaction of JAK2 - V617F – activat - ed granulocytes and monocytes with splenic cells may contribute to an inflamed microenvironment , which may stimulate extra - medullary hematopoiesis and thus splenomegaly . Although the exact molecular process is not entirely clear , it has already been proposed that potential mechanisms likely include differential responses to the unique splenic microenvironment of JAK2 - V617F – positive disease ( 31 , 34 ) .

After laparotomy , sterile saline was applied to the exteriorized intestine to prevent drying . The IVC was gently separated from the aorta , and partial ligation ( stenosis ) was induced by placing a 30 - gauge needle on the vessel and closure using a 7 - 0 polypropylene suture , followed by immediate removal of the needle . All visible side branches were ligated as well . After surgery , peritoneum and skin were closed with continuous 4 - 0 polypropylene sutures .

The appropriate working dilutions , incubation times , and positions within the MELC experiment were validated systematically using conditions suitable to MELC ( 52 ) . The series of fluorescence images produced by each tag were aligned pixel - wise using the corresponding phase contrast images . The automated algorithm reaches an alignment accuracy of 0 . 1 pixels . Illumination faults of the images were corrected using flat - field correction . Post - bleaching images were subtracted from the following fluorescence tag images . Section artifacts were exclud - ed as invalid by a manual mask - setting process . For intensity - based analysis or spatial distribution or relation of the recorded marker sig - nals , we randomly segmented the multiparametric MELC image into small objects of a size of 16 pixels ( Supplemental Figure 5A ) . For each of these small objects , the MFI and the smallest distance to 2 reference object masks were calculated . These masks were automatically created for the ICAM1 and VCAM1 marker signals to define regions that were positive for ICAM1 or VCAM1 . The resulting matrix of intensities and distances was exported into a flow cytometry standard ( FCS ) file and uploaded to the online cytometry analysis platform Cytobank ( https : / / www . cytobank . org / ) for multiparametric analysis . Statistics . Statistical significance was determined using an unpaired 2 - tailed t test , nonparametric Mann - Whitney U test , or 1 - way ANOVA . A P value less than 0 . 05 was considered significant . Study approval .

Four hours after partial ligation of the IVC , thrombi that devel - oped below the suture were analyzed for size and weight . For blockade of integrins , a mixture of 200 μ g VLA - 4 antibody ( clone PS / 2 , Hölzel Diag - nostics , catalog BE0071 ) and 200 μ g CD18 antibody ( clone GAME46 , BD Biosciences , catalog 555280 ) was injected i . v . 30 minutes before induction of partial IVC ligation . In vivo cell tracking using 111 indium SPECT . CD45 . 1 recipient mice ( 10 weeks old ) were i . v . injected with either JAK2 + / VF or JAK2 + / + WBM cells labeled with 111 indium according to the manufacturer’s instruc - tions ( Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals ) . Labeling efficiency was 74 . 6 % ± 6 . 6 % for JAK2 + / VF and 67 . 5 % ± 8 . 4 % for JAK2 + / + cells . 5 × 10 6 cells were labeled with 50 MBq 111 indium . Mice were i . v . ( jugular vein catheter ) injected with 111 indium - labeled cells at a rate of 40 μ l / min using per - fusion pumps ( 76 ) . For the first 2 animals ( one JAK2 + / VF , one JAK2 + / + ) syringes with 50 MBq were prepared ; for the remaining animals , half the dose was used , as signal / noise ratios were high . After injection , the amounts of 111 indium in the syringes used for injection and in the tubes used for connecting syringes and catheters were determined with a radionuclide calibrator ( Aktivimeter Isomed 2010 ) . The injected dose was calculated by subtracting these remaining amounts of 111 indium from the amounts present in the syringe before injection . For SPECT / CT imaging , animals were anesthetized with iso - flurane ( Baxter GmbH ) and O 2 ( induction 2 . 5 % isoflurane and 0 . 8 l / min O 2 ; maintenance 1 . 2 % isoflurane and 0 . 75 – 0 . 8 l / min O 2 ) . Coreg - istered SPECT / CT scans were made using a 4 - head NanoSPECT / CT ( Mediso ) . Whole - body SPECT scans were made using apertures with nine 1 . 4 - mm pinholes , providing a nominal spatial resolution of ≤1 . 0 mm . Acquisition times were 45 minutes to 1 hour . Photo peaks were set to the manufacturer’s default values for 111 indium ( 171 keV ± 5 % and 245 keV ± 5 % ) . Reconstructions were made with isotropic voxel sizes of 300 μ m . Whole - body CT scans were made at 45 keV , 0 . 17 mA , acquisition times of ca . 3 . 5 – 4 . 5 minutes depending on body size , 100 μ m resolution ; and reconstructed at isotropic voxel sizes of 200 μ m using InVivoScope ( version 1 . 43 ) software . Imeron 300 M ( Bracco Imaging ) was used as contrast agent and i . v . injected through the jugu - lar vein catheter ( 500 μ l at a rate of 50 μ l / min ) before the last CT scan after the final SPECT scan . The data were analyzed using the OsiriX DICOM Viewer ( version 5 . 7 . 1 ) , Imaris software ( x64 , version 7 . 7 . 2 , Bitplane ) , and Microsoft Excel ( version 10 . 7 . 2 ) . Whole - body 111 indium contents were quantified in OsiriX . Standardized uptake values for the spleen were calculated for each animal ( 111 indium content per cm 3 spleen divided by whole - body 111 indium content per whole - body volume in cm 3 ) . Automated multidimensional fluorescence microscopy by MELC . MELC was performed as described previously ( 52 ) . Briefly , snap - fro - zen splenic tissues from JAK + / + and JAK2 + / VF mice ( 16 weeks old ) were embedded into O . C . T . ( Sakura Finetek ) . 10 - μ m cryosections adhered to silane - coated cover slides were fixed with 2 % paraformaldehyde , permeabilized with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 , and blocked with 1 % BSA / PBS . The tissue samples were transferred to an inverted wide - field fluorescence microscope ( Leica DMI6000 , ×20 air lens , NA 0 . 70 ) . The automated cyclic robotic process started with the incubation of the first fluorescent antibody ( tag ) ( Supplemental Table 1 ) . After a series of washing steps , the fluorescence signals and a correspond - ing phase contrast image were acquired by a cooled charge - cou - pled device camera ( Apogee KX4 , Apogee Instruments ) . The specific signal of the given tag was removed by bleaching the fluorescent dye , The Journal of Clinical Investigation R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E 4 3 7 0 jci . org Volume 128 Number 10 October 2018 1 .
