Institution for Social and Policy Studies 1 Institution for Social and Policy Studies 77 Prospect Street , 203 . 432 . 3234 http : / / isps . yale . edu Director Jacob Hacker Executive Committee Nicholas Christakis , John Dovidio , Heather Gerken , James Levinsohn , Jennifer Richeson , Frances Rosenbluth , Ian Shapiro , Jody Sindelar , Ebonya Washington The Institution for Social and Policy Studies ( ISPS ) facilitates interdisciplinary social science inquiry on important public policy subjects in order to advance research , shape policy , and educate the next generation of policy thinkers and leaders . To achieve these ends , ISPS sponsors high - level conferences , interdisciplinary faculty seminars , targeted research projects on key policy issues , graduate and undergraduate fellowship programs , and postdoctoral appointments . Recognizing that important social problems cannot be studied adequately by a single discipline , the Yale Corporation established ISPS in 1968 to stimulate interdisciplinary collaboration within the University , both across the social sciences and between the social sciences and other disciplines . Today , ISPS hosts a number of major programs , including the Center for the Study of American Politics , the Center for the Study of Inequality , and ISPS Health—a University - wide health policy center . These programs organize many of their activities through ISPS’s Policy Lab , a space for policy - oriented events , research , and collaboration . ISPS also supports the Program in Ethics , Politics , and Economics ; and the Yale Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics . As the hub for problem - oriented interdisciplinary research at Yale , ISPS provides intellectual leadership in the social sciences ; fosters sound and creative research on public policies of local , state , and national signiﬁcance ; and informs both teaching at Yale and academic and public debates beyond Yale .
