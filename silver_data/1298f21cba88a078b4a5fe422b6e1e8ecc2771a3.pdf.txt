We generated ensembles of structures by time - averaged refinement , where local molecular vibrations were sampled by molecular - dynamics ( MD ) simulation whilst global disorder was partitioned into an underlying overall translation – libration – screw ( TLS ) model . Modeling of 20 protein datasets at 1 . 1 – 3 . 1 Å resolution reduced cross - validated R free values by 0 . 3 – 4 . 9 % , indicating that ensemble models fit the X - ray data better than single structures . The ensembles revealed that , while most proteins display a well - ordered core , some proteins exhibit a ‘molten core’ likely supporting functionally important dynamics in ligand binding , enzyme activity and protomer assembly . Order – disorder changes in HIV protease indicate a mechanism of entropy compensation for ordering the catalytic residues upon ligand binding by disordering specific core residues . Thus , ensemble refinement extracts dynamical details from the X - ray data that allow a more comprehensive understanding of structure – dynamics – function relationships . DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 00311 . 001 Introduction Since the dawn of structural biology there have been experimental observations of dynamic motion in proteins and other biomolecules ( Linderstrøm - Lang and Schellman , 1959 ) . Multiple biophysical methods have firmly established that such atomic ‘wigglings and jigglings’ ( Feynman et al . , 1963 ) play an inherent role in both protein structure and function ; and , in conjunction with high - resolution struc - tures insights into dynamics aid the understanding of biomolecular functions in catalysis , ligand or drug binding and macromolecular interactions . Presently X - ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy are the primary source of data for high - resolution protein structures . Whereas microscopy methods may provide information regarding long - range conformational changes , NMR characterizes fluctuations at atomic detail . However , due to the challenging nature of such experiments the number of dynamics studies is relatively sparse in contrast with the wealth of structural information available in the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) ( Berman et al . , 2000 ) . The majority of entries in the PDB derived from X - ray diffrac - tion data are presented as static , single , structures , although there is often extensive disorder resulting from protein dynamics and crystal - lattice distortions . Extracting atomic fluctuations from these diffrac - tion data would dramatically increase the scope for dynamics studies of biomolecules and potentially reveal atomic details of structure – function – dynamic mechanisms that have previously been obscured . The diffraction data of proteins are affected by multiple sources of disorder , notably arising from atomic vibrations , concerted motions of protein domains and inter - molecular lattice distortions . Structural models of proteins should account for both anisotropic and anharmonic distributions around the mean atomic positions to reproduce the observed Bragg intensities accurately ( Vitkup et al . , 2002 ; Furnham et al . , 2006 ) . However , explicit modelling of such distributions in macromolecules using current methods requires extensive parameterization inappropriate for the diffraction quality of * For correspondence : p . gros @ uu . nl Competing interests : The authors have declared that no competing interests exist Funding : See page 25 Received : 08 October 2012 Accepted : 23 October 2012 Published : 18 December 2012 Reviewing editor : Axel T Brunger , Howard Hughes Medical Institute , Stanford University , United States This is an open - access article , free of all copyright , and may be freely reproduced , distributed , transmitted , modified , built upon , or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 00311 2 of 29 Research article a typical protein crystal . Multi - conformer structures represent both anisotropic and anharmonic disorder , but despite numerous attempts at automating the inclusion of minor conformations ( DePristo et al . , 2004 ; Levin et al . , 2007 ; Terwilliger et al . , 2007 ; Korostelev et al . , 2009 ; van den Bedem et al . , 2009 ; Lang et al . , 2010 ) , 95 % of all protein residues in the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) ( Berman et al . , 2000 ) derived from diffraction data are modelled with a single conformation ( Lang et al . , 2010 ) . As opposed to multiple discrete models , a MD simulation with time - averaged restraints ( Gros et al . , 1990 ) results in a population of structures in which the individual models are interrelated by a Boltzmann - weighted energy function . This method introduced by Torda et al . ( 1989 ) and implemented in macromolecular crystallography by Gros et al . ( 1990 ) , showed a reduction in R - value . However , cross - validation introduced subsequently ( Brünger , 1992 ) revealed chronically over - fitted models ( Burling and Brunger , 1994 ; Clarage and Phillips , 1994 ; Schiffer et al . , 1995 ) . Here , we present an ensemble - refinement method that restricts the number of structures modelled and thereby prevents over - fitting of the data . We model large - scale motions , attributable to , for example , lattice distortions , by an underlying global disorder model . This approach allows MD simulations to sample local atomic fluctuations only , without the need for sampling large - scale global disorder . We show that the method yields reproducible ensembles with improved fit to the X - ray data , as validated by cross validation , R free ( Brünger , 1992 ) , and stereochemical analyses . Analyses of the ensembles show that detailed features are observed indicating atomic fluctuations that may be relevant for the biological function of the macromolecules . eLife digest It has been clear since the early days of structural biology in the late 1950s that proteins and other biomolecules are continually changing shape , and that these changes have an important influence on both the structure and function of the molecules . X - ray diffraction can provide detailed information about the structure of a protein , but only limited information about how its structure fluctuates over time . Detailed information about the dynamic behaviour of proteins is essential for a proper understanding of a variety of processes , including catalysis , ligand binding and protein – protein interactions , and could also prove useful in drug design . Currently most of the X - ray crystal structures in the Protein Data Bank are ‘snap - shots’ with limited or no information about protein dynamics . However , X - ray diffraction patterns are affected by the dynamics of the protein , and also by distortions of the crystal lattice , so three - dimensional ( 3D ) models of proteins ought to take these phenomena into account . Molecular - dynamics ( MD ) computer simulations transform 3D structures into 4D ‘molecular movies’ by predicting the movement of individual atoms . Combining MD simulations with crystallographic data has the potential to produce more realistic ensemble models of proteins in which the atomic fluctuations are represented by multiple structures within the ensemble . Moreover , in addition to improved structural information , this process—which is called ensemble refinement—can provide dynamical information about the protein . Earlier attempts to do this ran into problems because the number of model parameters needed was greater than the number of observed data points . Burnley et al . now overcome this problem by modelling local molecular vibrations with MD simulations and , at the same time , using a course - grain model to describe global disorder of longer length scales . Ensemble refinement of high - resolution X - ray diffraction datasets for 20 different proteins from the Protein Data Bank produced a better fit to the data than single structures for all 20 proteins . Ensemble refinement also revealed that 3 of the 20 proteins had a ‘molten core’ , rather than the well - ordered residues core found in most proteins : this is likely to be important in various biological functions including ligand binding , filament formation and enzymatic function . Burnley et al . also showed that a HIV enzyme underwent an order – disorder transition that is likely to influence how this enzyme works , and that similar transitions might influence the interactions between the small - molecule drug Imatinib ( also known as Gleevec ) and the enzymes it targets . Ensemble refinement could be applied to the majority of crystallography data currently being collected , or collected in the past , so further insights into the properties and interactions of a variety of proteins and other biomolecules can be expected .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 00311 3 of 29 Research article Results and discussion Ensemble refinement of 20 datasets from the PDB We performed MD simulations , in which the model was restrained by a time - averaged X - ray ( Gros et al . , 1990 ) , maximum - likelihood ( Pannu and Read , 1996 ; Adams et al . , 1997 ; Murshudov et al . , 1997 ) target function ( see ‘Materials and methods’ ) . The X - ray restraint optimized 〈 F calc ( hkl ) 〉 against F obs ( hkl ) , where 〈 F calc ( hkl ) 〉 are computed as rolling averages from the structures in the MD trajectory , with the length of the averaging window determined by the relaxation time τ x . This approach contrasts with the traditional crystallographic refinement approach , where F calc ( hkl ) are computed from a single structure and optimized against F obs ( hkl ) . Prior to the simulations we approximated the large - scale disorder by an overall TLS model derived from the atomic B - factors of the refined single structure . Using one TLS group per protein molecule or domain , we iteratively fitted TLS parameters ( Schomaker and Trueblood , 1968 ; Winn et al . , 2001 ) to the atomic B - factors of the protein atoms excluding atoms with large deviations in B - factor from the Table 1 .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 00311 4 of 29 Research article TLS - derived B - factor ( the parameter p TLS described the percentage of atoms included in TLS - fitting ; see ‘Materials and methods’ ) . The resulting TLS model was applied to all atoms throughout the simulation . Effectively , this TLS model of the protein core excludes the effects of hyper - flexible surface loops and , hence , describes the global disorder that may be attributed to inter - molecular lattice distortions and overall intra - molecular breathing or domain shifts . Ensemble refinement was tested using 20 diffraction datasets from the PDB and started from either the PDB or PDB _ REDO ( Joosten et al . , 2010 ) structures ( ‘Materials and methods’ ) . Upper resolution limits of the datasets ranged from 1 . 1 to 3 . 1 Å resolution and structures had 50 to 1 , 004 amino - acid residues in the asymmetric unit ( Table 1 ) . The simulations were run at an effective temperature of 300 K for the protein atoms , using a temperature bath ( T bath ) slightly below 300 K to allow for heating due to the non - conservative nature of the time - averaged X - ray restraint modulated by its weight w x - ray ( ‘Materials and methods’ ) . Explicitly modelled solvent atoms were added and / or removed intermittently during the simulation dependent on the corresponding electron - density and difference maps ( ‘Materials and methods’ ) . Bulk solvent effects were accounted for by an averaged Flat Bulk - Solvent Model ( Jiang and Brünger , 1994 ; Afonine et al . , 2005 ) ( ‘Materials and methods’ ) . The parameters p TLS , τ x and the T bath and w x - ray pair were optimized in a grid search resulting in a shallow optimum scored by R free ( Figure 1A ) . After a period of equilibration , the trajectory of structures was acquired over an extensive period of time ( 40 times τ x ) . Figure 1B shows the R - values as they developed over the simulation time for a structure with PDB code 1UOY ( Olsen et al . , 2004 ) , for which the largest improvement in R free was observed among the datasets tested ( possibly due to the high degree of anisotropic and anharmonic side - chain motion for this case ) . The R - values started at a high value and remained high ( ∼ 35 % ) for the individual structures , which is in agreement with the observation that the derived global TLS B - factor model is not optimal for fitting a single structure to the data . Averaging the structure factors over the relaxation time τ x of 1 ps ( corresponding to the rolling average structure factors used in the X - ray restraint ) dropped the R work and R free to ∼ 11 % and ∼ 15 % respectively . The R work and R free of the collected ensemble of structures ( corre - sponding to unweighted averaged structure factors ) monotonically decreased to 10 . 3 and 13 . 7 % respectively . over the acquisition period of 40 ps . The improvement in R - values from the ensemble model with respect to the single - structure model spanned the entire resolution range of the data ( Figure 1C ) . Acquisition over 40 times τ x yielded a highly redundant set of structures . We reduced the number of structures by calculating the minimum number of structures , that is 167 in the case of 1UOY , required to reproduce the R - value of the trajectory ( Figure 1D and ‘Materials and methods’ ) . Analysis of all 20 datasets showed that ensemble refinement improved the R free by between 0 . 3 and 4 . 9 percentage points compared to single structures re - refined using the same program pack - age , that is Phenix ( Afonine et al . , 2012 ) , with a mean improvement of 1 . 8 % in R free values ( Table 1 , Figure 2A ) . The effect of the starting structure on ensemble refinement was assessed by using alter - native refinement programs , phenix . refine , Refmac ( Vagin et al . , 2004 ) , and Buster ( Bricogne et al . , 2009 ) , to generate varying input models . No significant differences were observed due to the differ - ent starting models ( Tables 3 and 4 ) . The improvement in R free , number of structures in the final ensemble and the averaging time τ x tended to increase with resolution ( Figure 2A – C ) . The optimum values for the parameters p TLS and T bath are not correlated with resolution ( Figure 2D , E ) . Concomitant with the reduction in R - values , the ensemble models reduced electron - density differences , decreas - ing rms fluctuations in difference maps by 0 to 41 % with an average of 12 % improvement ( Table 2 ) . The difference electron - density maps for the single - structure and ensemble models indicated improvements throughout the asymmetric unit cell , as exemplified in Figure 1E . Validation of ensemble refinement We used the high - quality experimental phases available to high resolution for 1YTT of mannose - binding protein ( Burling et al . , 1996 ) to validate the ensemble - refinement method . The overall correlation coefficient between the electron - density map from the ensemble model ( obtained without experimen - tal phases ) and the experimentally phased electron - density map was 0 . 903 , compared with 0 . 873 and 0 . 895 for the published and re - refined single structures . These seemingly small improvements in over - all quality indicators allow for significant local improvements . Real - space correlation coefficients ( Brändén and Jones , 1990 ) highlighted marked local improvements for flexible residues in particular ( Figure 3A ) with 11 residues improving by more than 0 . 1 in correlation coefficient . This observation was consistent with local improvements in electron - density differences in regions of flexible or disordered Biophysics and structural biology Burnley et al . eLife 2012 ; 1 : e00311 .

Moreover , the ensemble model contained structural details previously identified in a multiple - model approach by Burling et al . ( 1996 ) , as shown for the anisotropic distribution for the side chain of Phe121 ( Figure 3C ) and diffuse water shells around hydrophobic residues ( Figure 3D ) . Figure 3E shows that the most occupied water sites in the ensemble correlated with low atomic B - factors for waters in the single - structure model . Next , we analysed the stereochemistry of the computed ensemble models . The robustness of the observed atomic distributions was tested by repeating ensemble refinements 10 times using different random starting velocities . Figure 4A shows that the observed distributions are highly reproducible . With data extending to 1 . 5 - Å resolution correlations above 0 . 99 were observed between residue distributions from separate runs . At lower resolutions , the majority of residues showed correlations above 0 . 95 , with occasionally correlations dropping below 0 . 8 in very flexible regions ( see Figure 4B , C ) .

Averaged over all 20 cases , the rms deviations from ideal - ized bond lengths , bond angles and dihedral angles for the re - refined single - structures were 0 . 010 Å , 1 . 26° and 15 . 2° respectively . ( Figure 6—source data 1 ) . These deviations decreased for the ensemble models by 0 . 002 Å , 0 . 26° and 6 . 6° respectively , when considering the centroids of the observed stere - ochemical distributions . Taking all fluctuations around the centroids ( i . e . complete distributions ) into account , these values increased by 0 . 002 Å , 0 . 33° and 4 . 0° respectively compared to the statistics from single structures . This indicates high stereochemical quality for the ensemble model , but that the ensemble of structures contained fluctuations exhibiting larger deviations from ideality . Figure 6A , B shows that high - energy conformations , as indicated by for example non - favourable Ramachandran φ , ψ - angle combinations , occurred transiently and were concentrated in regions of structural flexibility . Counting the most frequent Ramachandran classification for each φ , ψ - angle showed that the ensem - bles have a similar percentage for ‘allowed’ and an increased number of ‘outliers’ compared to the single structures ( Figure 6C and Figure 6—source data 2 ) . These analyses illustrate that in ensemble refinement conformations were sampled , rather than optimized to a single configuration as in single - structure refinement . Similar to Brünger ( Brünger , 1992 ) , we observe that lower R free values correlate with better quality of the Ramachandran statistics ( Figure 6D ) . The presence of non - crystallographic symmetry ( NCS ) allowed for crystallographically - independent observations of atomic fluctuations in multiple copies of a protein molecule ( Figure 7A – C ) . In some cases , the applied global TLS models differed significantly between NCS - related copies ( Figure 7B ) . Nevertheless , we observed atomic fluctuations similar both in magnitude and location for related cop - ies in areas not affected by crystal packing ( Figure 7B , C ; additional cases of NCS are presented in Figure 7—figure supplement 1 – 4 ) . Apparently , variations in overall disorder arising from packing dif - ferences of NCS copies ( as indicated by different B - factor distributions ) were well accounted for by the Table 2 .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 00311 8 of 29 Research article applied global TLS models . Similarly , a global increase in disorder present in a dataset collected at ambient temperature vs an isomorphous dataset collected under cryo - conditions was fully accounted for by an increase in global TLS ( Figure 8A ) . These data indicate that the derived atomic fluctuations are molecular traits and that the global TLS model accounts for overall disorder , which includes for example lattice or packing effects . Functional dynamics revealed by ensemble refinement Inspection of the obtained ensembles showed that most proteins , as expected , are characterized by well - ordered residues in the protein core and flexible residue side chains and loops on the outside ( an example is given in Figure 9A ) . However , three cases exhibited marked flexibility of residue side chains on the inside of the molecule . 1BV1 ( Gajhede et al . , 1996 ) , major birch pollen allergen , has a large forked solvent channel with multiple disordered side chains and a diffuse water network ( Figure 9B ) . The cavity is consistent with its putative role as a general plant steroid carrier ( Markovi ć - Housley et al . , 2003 ) . Presumably , the flexible internal residues play a role in binding the diverse ligands . More surprising are the disordered cores in 1X6P of PAK pilin ( Dunlop et al . , 2005 ) ( Figure 9C ) and 3K0N of the enzyme proline isomerase ( Fraser et al . , 2009 ) ( Figure 9D ) ; in both these cases , the datasets were recorded at ambient temperatures . Multiple ( 16 ) aliphatic and aromatic side chains are highly flexible , forming a molten core in the pilin molecule . These flexible residues , which are extremely well conserved in the type IV pilin family , create the central interface between the characteristic long α - helix and β - sheet of this protein fold ( Hazes et al . , 2000 ) . We hypothesize that this monomeric pilin structure represents an intermediate molten state , which becomes stabilized upon protomer filament formation . The third case with flexible residues on the interior is 3K0N of proline isomerase ( Fraser et al . , 2009 ) . As with the pilin structure , several ( 11 ) aromatic and aliphatic residues showed large side chain fluctuations , yielding a molten core of the protein structure . However , the same protein under cryogenic conditions ( 3K0M ) ( Fraser et al . , 2009 ) showed mostly well - ordered side chains in the ensemble ( Figure 9D , right - hand side ) , indicating that at cryogenic conditions the molten core has been annealed to its ground state configuration . As discussed in more detail in the next paragraph , the observed flexibility of the core residues at ambient tempera - ture is likely of functional relevance for the enzyme . Thus , the computed ensemble models high - lighted a hitherto unnoticed phenomenon of molten cores in folded proteins , which are likely relevant for the biological function of these molecules . NMR spectroscopy has previously revealed specific dynamics for active - site residues of proline isomerase ( Eisenmesser et al . , 2005 ) . The solvent - exposed residues Arg55 and Met61 in the active site showed disorder in 3K0M ( Fraser et al . , 2009 ) , where data were collected at 100 K . For 3K0N collected at 288 K , a number of additional residues with multiple conformations were observed ( Figure 8A , B ) . Table 3 . Effect of input structure on ensemble refinement .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / eLife . 00311 9 of 29 Research article These included Ser99 , Phe113 , which are part of the substrate - binding pocket together with Arg55 and Met61 ( Figure 10A ) , and Leu98 , which neighbours the flexible residue Ser99 but points into the hydrophobic core ( Fraser et al . , 2009 ) . Ensemble refinement of the 288 K data revealed a large number of residue side chains in the core to be flexible . This flexibility in the core appears to be linked to the dynamics of active - site residues through the intervening β - sheet . In particular , the main - chain H - bonding network ( C = O·HN ) of neighbouring β - strands within the sheet was flexible , as indicated by anisotropy in the C = O bonds of residues 55 - 62 - 113 - 98 ( with the largest anisotropy observed for 55 and 62 ; see Figure 10B ) . Analysis of the side - chain conformations for the active - site residues Arg55 , Met61 , Ser99 and Phe113 showed a 10 % minor conformation for the four active - site residues ( Figure 10C ) , which is in good agreement with NMR relaxation data ( see Figure 2 in Eisenmesser et al . , 2005 ) . Mutation of Ser99 to Thr ( > 14 Å away from the catalytic Arg55 ) affects the side - chain distributions and lowers the activity ∼ 300 - fold , similar to an Arg55Lys mutation of the catalytic residue ( Eisenmesser et al . , 2005 ; Fraser et al . , 2009 ) . Thus , the ensemble refinement results support the notion put forward by Eisenmesser et al . and Fraser et al . that side chain dynamics play a critical role in the enzymatic function of proline isomerase and , moreover , expand upon this theme to reveal mechanistic insights arising from the underlying detailed dynamics . Ligand binding to HIV protease is known to have marked effects on the enzyme structure ( Heaslet et al . , 2007 ) . We compared HIV protease in its apo form , 2PC0 ( Heaslet et al . , 2007 ) , and bound to ligand JE - 2147 , 1KZK ( Reiling et al . , 2002 ) . As for proline isomerase , HIV protease exhibited flexible , moldable , substrate - binding pockets in the apo state . Enthalpic and entropic binding of the ligand with high affinity ( K D = 41 pM ) ( Velazquez - Campoy et al . , 2001 ) reduced the flexibility in the substrate binding pockets by protein – ligand H - bond interactions and van der Waals stacking ( Figure 11A , B ) . Upon ligand binding , Asp90 became ordered through H - bonding with the ligand in P2 , whereas its dimeric partner lacked a H - bonding partner in P2 ′ and remained flexible as in the unbound state . The canonical aspartic protease catalytic residues , Asp25 of both monomers , became ordered upon ligand binding . Concomitantly , we observed significant changes in dynamics of specific core residues ( Figure 11C ) . Some residues , most notably Thr26 , ‘froze’ ( Thr26 is part of the conserved Asp25 - Thr26 - Gly - 27 sequence ) . In contrast , the side chains of other residues , most notably Cys95 and Leu97 opposite of Thr26 , became highly disordered in the bound state , whereas they were relatively ordered in the unbound state . This observation supports NMR data that showed that conformational variability increases upon inhibitor binding for Leu97 amongst others ( Torchia and Ishima , 2003 ) . These data suggest that the entropy lost by the catalytic aspartates upon ligand binding is compensated with an increase in disorder of specific core residue side chains . This type of dynamic modulation was also observed for Ca 2 + binding to calmodulin , where this effect was dubbed entropy compensation ( Lee et al . , 2000 ) . Similar to the molten core dynamics for proline isomerase , the structure ensembles Table 4 . F model cross - correlation scores for ensembles generated with different input models .

These complexes are typically interpreted as static structures , and the impact of dynamics , if considered at all , is probed using computational methods . Our new ensemble refinement approach makes it possible to study the role of dynamics in drug – target complexes in the context of the experi - mental data . Therefore , we analysed two structures of Abl kinase in complex with Imatinib ( also known as Gleevec ) , that is 1IEP , and PD173955 , that is 1M52 ( Nagar et al . , 2002 ) . These compounds bind the Abl kinase with high affinity , 37 nM ( Schindler et al . , 2000 ) and 100 nM respectively ( Nagar et al . , 2002 ) . The ensembles provide insights into the flexibility of the protein residues and the ligand moi - eties in the complex . Figure 12A shows the variation in H - bonding observed in Abl kinase – Imatinib . Variable H - bonding interactions were observed for the hydrophilic N - methylpiperazine moiety with the backbone carbonyl atoms of Ile360 and His361 . In contrast , the ensemble displayed a Figure 4 . Sampling reproducibility of ensemble refinement .

Moreover , the ordered water network between Glu286 , Lys271 and the pyrimidine moiety of Imatinib ( Nagar et al . , 2002 ) was reproduced in the ensemble model ( Figure 12B ) . We observed that the Abl kinase adopts two different states in these crystal structures . In the Imatinib complex the activation loop , residues 381 – 402 , is highly disordered ( Figure 12C ) , which was confirmed by comparison to previously published NMR data ( Vajpai et al . , 2008 ) . In general , the ensemble models indicate details of tight and highly ordered drug – target interactions on one side vs disordered interactions elsewhere , which are indic - ative of less tight interactions , that may suggest which sites to modify in a drug - optimization cycle .

DOI : 10 . 7554 / elife . 00311 . 014 Conclusions We have shown that far more structural information can be reliably extracted from protein diffraction data than is achieved to date by traditional single - structure modelling methods . Our ensemble refine - ment method samples distributions that reflect structural details of protein dynamics . The resulting ensemble models provide a more comprehensive description of the molecules and allow interpret - ation of the molecular function in terms of both the three - dimensional arrangements of the protein residues and their flexibilities . Moreover , ensemble models minimize the risk of structural over - interpretation associated with the seemingly rigid single - structure models . We found comparative analyses of protein molecules in different states to be very useful for identifying detailed changes in structural dynamics that may be mechanistically relevant for the molecular function . Partitioning large - scale disorder into a global model separates intermolecular variations of protein packing in the crystal from the detailed intra - molecular atomic fluctuations .

In this way , the ensemble of structures is generated to model the anisotropic and anharmonic electron - density distributions precisely , while being restrained by the bonded and non - bonded energy terms used in the MD simulation . The separa - tion of global disorder and local atomic fluctuations contrasts the original approach by Gros et al . ( 1990 ) , where the MD sampling had to account for both the large scale global disorder and local fluctuations leading to very long relaxation times τ x of 16 ps . In the current work much shorter relaxation times of 0 . 25 – 2 ps can be used , thereby limiting potential over - fitting markedly . The method is applicable to data with a wide range of upper resolution limits . We see marked improve - ments in R free for datasets ranging from 1 . 5 to 2 . 6 - Å upper - resolution limit . A detailed interpret - ation of the ensembles is allowed , supported by the very high local correlations between independent ensemble refinements . However , at lower resolution limits and for highly disordered loops the local correlation between independent runs drops and detailed interpretation is not feasible . Thus , even though the number of independent parameters in an ensemble model is not clearly defined ( and therefore the parameter - to - observation ratio is unclear ) , the gain in R free and the very high local correlations between independent runs indicate a high reliability of the ensem - ble models . However , the method is not a panacea for highly disordered protein regions . In the absence of ordered conformations for a certain region of the protein ( as implicitly defined by the diffraction data ) the ensemble refinement will sample diverse conformations in order to prevent the build up of negative peaks in the electron - density difference map . In other words , if the data ‘says’ that a region is disordered , ensemble refinement will generate diverse conformations for that region . Furthermore , dataset pathologies caused , for example , by radiation damage may have confounded effects that obscure the dynamics inherent to the protein molecule . Thus , per - haps somewhat counter - intuitively , this modelling method that accounts for inherent protein Figure 8 .

This averaging function is updated with the current individual structure every 10 time - steps ( ∆ t ) during the simulation and is implemented as in ( 3 ) .

Electron - density and difference density maps are generated using F modelt , excluding reflections in the free R set . Water oxygen atoms with an electron - density peak > 1 . 0 σ in the 2 m F obs − D F model map or a peak > 3 . 0 σ in the m F obs − D F model map are preserved , otherwise the atom is removed . New water atoms are added for positions which have a 2 m F obs − D F model peak > 1 . 0 σ and a m F obs − D F model peak > 3 . 0 σ , and are between 1 . 8 – 3 . 0 Å in distance to an existing atom . For high - resolution cases these criteria are adjusted to include m F obs − D F model map peaks > 2 . 5 σ . Newly positioned atoms are assigned a random , Boltzmann - weighted , velocity . Explicitly modelled solvent atoms contribute to the atomic model ( F calc ) . Bulk solvent is modelled using a solvent mask ( Afonine et al . , 2005 ) . The mask structure factors ( F mask ) are averaged in the same manner as the atomic model ( F calc ) ( 4 ) .

Constrained target functions The overall scale factor , k , is constrained during the simulation . For the maximum - likelihood target function , as shown for acentric reflections , ( 5 ) during normalisation ( 6 ) , the sum of the rolling - average structure factor array ( 2 ) is scaled to the sum of the structure factor array from the starting model ( F ref ) as shown in ( 7 ) .     σ σ     σ σ σ     2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 + 2 = exp - 1 - 1 - t t obs obs A model obs A model x - ray A A A E E E E E P I , 1 - ( 5 ) , t t model model N kF E = ε ∑ ( 6 ) = , ref hkl tmodel hkl F k F ∑ ∑ ( 7 ) where , E obs and E model are the normalised structure factors , σ A is the Sigma - A weighting factor , I 0 is a modified Bessel function of order 0 and ε is the expected intensity factor . Temperature bath and X - ray weight The simulations are performed such that the non - solvent atoms are at a target temperature ( T target ) of 300 K , where the simulation is coupled to a velocity - scaled temperature - bath ( Berendsen et al . , 1984 ) . The temperature bath is set to a value less than 300 K , typically 295 – 298 K . Because the X - ray restraints are computed from a time - dependent memory function , the X - ray energy term is non - conservative and thus heating occurs . During the equilibration phase the X - ray weight ( w x - ray ) is modulated by the temperature of the protein atoms ( T protein ) every 10 time - steps ( ∆ t ) , such that the non - solvent atoms sample consistently at the target temperature ( 8 ) . ∆ = target t t - t x - ray x - ray protein T w w . T ( 8 ) Thus , the thermostat offset controls the X - ray weight in a system independent manner whilst main - taining the target temperature . In the acquisition phase the X - ray weight is fixed to the averaged value used in the equilibration phase . TLS approximation of the global disorder The partitioning of inter - molecular disorder is performed before the start of the simulation using ADPs from the traditionally refined starting structure . TLS groups are assigned per molecule or domain as appropriate to model global packing disorder . For each group , TLS parameters are fitted to the ADPs of the starting structure for all non - solvent , non - hydrogen atoms . The agreement of the isotropic equivalents for the fitted TLS ADPs ( B tls ) and the reference ADPs ( B ref ) is scored as ( 9 ) for all non - solvent , non - hydrogen atoms . i i i ref tls R B B = - . ( 9 ) A percentile of atoms with the poorest fitting ADPs ( p TLS ) are excluded from the next round of TLS parameter fitting and repeated until the fitted TLS parameters converge . The converged TLS param - eters are then applied to all atoms within that group for the duration of the simulation . Solvent atoms are assigned to the TLS group of the closest non - water atom , this assignment is updated every 250 time - steps . This TLS model produced lower R - values than using the ADP values from the re - refined single structure or using the one overall isotropic B - factor for all atoms in the model ( Table 5 ) .

The R - values of all possible contiguous time blocks are calculated and the periods with the lowest R work are selected . This selection reduces the R work by 0 – 1 . 0 % ( mean improvement in 0 . 3 % ) . For the 1YTT dataset with high quality experimental phases , the block selection for lowest R work corres - ponds well with the overall map correlation coefficient computed between the experimentally phased map and the map derived from the ensemble model ( Figure 13 ) . Next , to reduce the redundancy in the number of structures in the final ensemble ( during the simulation thousands of structures are collected ) , we calculate the smallest number of structures that reproduce the R free within 0 . 1 % . This is performed by iteratively parsing the stored structures with increasing time spacing ( see Figure 1D ) . The overall and bulk - solvent scale factors are optimised for the final ensemble . The ensembles of structures are stored using the standard PDB format for multiple models , with B - factors listed as com - puted from the TLS model and overall B - factor scaling contributions . Calculation of atomic positional probability All atoms comprising the ensemble are assigned a probability ( P i ) based on the positional likelihood of atom i in a given model relative to the complete ensemble of models . F calc electron - density maps are calculated for each model in the ensemble and 〈 F calc 〉 electron - density map is calculated for the com - plete ensemble as ( 10 ) . P i is calculated as ( 12 ) . . calc calc i i i P = ρ ρ FFFF FFFF ( 12 ) Table 5 . Comparison of three B - factor models for ensemble refinement . Burling et al .

These probabilities aid the visual inspection of the ensemble models and allow the observer to control the level of detail displayed ( Figure 14 ) . Ensemble refinement protocol Preparing the starting model The starting structures were taken from the PDB server or from the PDB _ REDO server if the R free was < 0 . 25 % than the equivalent PDB structure . We removed alternative positions and set corre - sponding occupancies to one . Overall aniso - tropic scale factors and solvent scale and B - factor ( k sol and B sol ) were calculated based on these tra - ditional single - structures ( i . e . using the refined B - factor models ) . Next , the atomic B - factors were substituted by B - factors derived the global TLS disorder model ( ‘Materials and methods’— TLS approximation of the global disorder ) . X - ray restrained MD simulation At t = 0 〈 F calc 〉 and 〈 F sol 〉 are set to F calc and F sol . Boltzmann - weighted velocities are assigned to the atoms , corresponding to T = 300 K . The bath temperature T bath used for velocity scaling is coupled to the X - ray weight ( w x - ray ) calculation , resulting in a temperature of 300 K for all non - solvent atoms . The simulation time - step used is 0 . 5 fs and the force - field parameterisation is as described ( Grosse - Kunstleve et al . , 2004 ) . Simulations are started in parallel with varying values of p TLS ( e . g . 0 . 2 , 0 . 6 , 0 . 8 , 0 . 9 , 1 . 0 ) , τ x ( e . g . 0 . 25 , 0 . 5 and 1 . 0 ps ) and T bath ( e . g . 295 and 299 K ) . Water positions are picked according to electron - density criteria and updated every 250 steps . Every 10 time - steps rolling average structure factors , 〈 F calc 〉 and 〈 F sol 〉 , are updated for use in the time - averaged X - ray restraints . σ A Values are updated if the R free of the rolling average model improves by > 0 . 25 % . The simulations have an equilibration phase ( 20 τ x ) in which the temperature , X - ray weight and averaged structure factors stabilize . This is followed by an acquisition phase ( 40 τ x ) where the values for w x - ray and σ A are fixed and the structures for the final ensemble model are collected . CPU time CPU time for a dataset at 2 . 0 - Å resolution with 199 residues in the asymmetric unit is 25 hr for each simulation using a 1 . 9 GHz processor . Single structure re - refinements The single structure re - refinements used the same starting structure as the ensemble refinements ( alternative conformations were not removed ) and were re - refined using phenix . refine ( version 1 . 7 . 1 ) ( Afonine et al . , 2012 ) and Buster ( version 2 . 10 . 0 ) ( Bricogne et al . , 2009 ) . Standard parameters were used with the exception of optimizing the target weights and increasing the number of macro - cycles to 8 in phenix . refine . Explicit water refinement was performed , anisotropic ADPs were used if present in starting structure and TLS parameters were defined as used in the starting structure . PDB _ REDO ( Joosten et al . , 2010 ) models were used as deposited . Additional ensemble refinement calculations Testing B - factor model in ensemble refinement Burling et al . ( Burling and Brunger , 1994 ) had previously shown that the choice of ADPs for ensemble refinement can affect the resultant structures . Three alternative ADP models were tested for seven datasets , as shown in Table 5 . ADP model 1 , ‘Global isotropic B - factor’ , uses one overall isotropic B - factor applied to all atoms in the simulation . Multiple trials were performed to establish the optimum single value . For comparison the Wilson B - factor of the data is listed . ADP model 2 , ‘Refined ADPs’ , uses the ADPs from the refined single - structures . Best results were obtained by multiplying the refined ADPs by given scale factor . ADP model 3 , ‘Basal TLS ADPs’ , uses the basal TLS model with one TLS Figure 13 .

The basal TLS model returns the lowest R free values in all test cases . Effect of starting model on ensemble refinement To test the effect of the starting structure three datasets ( 1UOY , 3CA7 and 1BV1 ) were re - refined with Buster , phenix . refine and Refmac as given by the PDB _ REDO server . Each of these re - refined structures was used as the input structure for ensemble refinement , using the same run - time parameters . Each ensemble refinement was repeated three times using a different random number to generate the Figure 14 . Interpretation of global and local details of 1UOY ensemble model is aided by relative atomic probabil - ity ( as described in ‘Materials and methods’ ) .

The results are shown in Table 3 . The mean R free ( averaged over the random number seed repeats ) of the resulting ensembles from the three different input structures are within 0 . 5 % . The F model cross correlation of ensemble pairs ( best representative from each program , selected by R free ) was calculated and is shown in Table 4 . All ensemble pairs exhibit a cross correlation of greater than 0 . 99 . Partial occupancies Because occupancy and B - factor are strongly coupled in a traditional refinement , the occupancies of bound ligands and ions are typically set to unity , while the corresponding B - factors are refined in a single - structure refinement . In ensemble refinement , the B - factors are not refined , but are derived from the global TLS model and the atomic fluctuations . All simulations were initially performed with full occupancy for bound ligands and ions . In several cases , this resulted in excessive sampling of the ligand or ion , as seen when inspecting the ensemble and reported by the kinetic energies during the simulation , which were far in excess of neighbouring protein atoms . These observations indicate that the corresponding occupancy of the bound ligand or ion is less than one . In these cases the occupancies were lowered and the simulations repeated until the kinetic energy of the ligand or ion were equivalent to the proximal protein components .
