Introduction The cell adhesion molecule E - cadherin is among the key molecules in the formation of the epithelial junctional complex [ 1 – 3 ] . E - cadherin forms homodimers in the extra - cellular domain between adjacent cells [ 4 ] and interacts intracellularly with a group of proteins collectively named catenins [ 5 , 6 ] . Both the cadherin cytoplasmic domain and the associated catenins are required for full cell adhesion [ 7 , 8 ] , and α - catenin is suggested to play a role in anchoring the cadherin - catenin complex to actin - based cytoskeletal components that include α - actinin and vinculin [ 9 ] . Loss or signiﬁcant reduction of E - cadherin expression has been observed in many epithelial cancers [ 10 – 14 ] , and the α - catenin gene is occasionally lost [ 14 , 15 ] or mutated in human cancer cells lines [ 16 ] . Unlike E - cadherin and α - catenin , β - catenin loses its function upon tyrosine phospho - rylation in response to growth factors [ 17 – 20 ] or v - Src [ 21 , 22 ] . Tyrosine phosphorylation of β - catenin results in loss of anchoring of the E - cadherin - catenin complex to the network of actin ﬁlaments ( F - actin ) [ 23 , 24 ] . In normal epithelial cells in culture , tyrosine - phosphorylated β - catenin needs to be dephosphorylated in order to link the E - cadherin - catenin complex to F - actin . In fact , several protein tyrosine phosphatases ( PTPs ) , including DEP - 1 , PTP1B , and PTP μ , are upregulated with increasing cell density [ 25 , 26 ] , and they associate with the E - cadherin - catenin complex [ 27 – 31 ] . Therefore , constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of β - catenin and concomitant loss of PTP might cause loss of E - cadherin - mediated cell - cell adhesion in cancer cells . Another mode of dysfunction of cell - cell adhesion is induced by perturbation of F - actin assembly to which the E - cadherin - catenin complex anchors . IQGAP1 , the IQ moti - containing guanine nucleotide - activating protein 1 ( IQGAP1 ) [ 32 ] , is an actin cross - linking protein [ 33 , 34 ] or sca ﬀ old protein [ 35 ] . IQGAP1 is recruited by protein phosphatase ( PP ) 2A to the E - cadherin - catenin complex that is constitutively associated with the small GTP - binding protein Rac1 [ 36 , 37 ] , thereby leading to rearrangement of F - actin by IQGAP1 in corporation with Rac1 to which the E - cadherin - catenin complex anchors . Because inhibition of PP2A activity or loss of PP2A expression results in E - cadherin endocytosis [ 37 , 38 ] , PP2A is considered to be involved in the establishment and maintenance of E - cadherin - mediated cell - cell adhesion as well as in a wide variety of biological processes such as tumor suppression [ 39 – 41 ] , formation of tight junctions [ 42 ] , and integrin - mediated cell - substratum adhesion [ 43 – 48 ] . Loss of cell - cell adhesion due to the internalization or endocytosis of E - cadherin without signiﬁcant alterations in E - cadherin 2 Journal of Oncology expression has been observed in many cells [ 38 , 49 – 52 ] . Despite this , PP2A expression is lost in both invasive and noninvasive cancer cells [ 38 ] . This implies that the loss of cell - cell adhesion is necessary but insu ﬃ cient alone for cell migration and invasion . In this paper , we focus on recent advances in the under - standing of the mechanisms underlying regulation of cell migration and invasion that have been possible through the use of biochemical and pharmacological approaches . 2 . Regulation of Cell Migration Cell migration and invasion generally require rearrangement of F - actin at the leading edge of cells [ 53 ] and are associated with the formation of speciﬁc cellular protrusions termed lamellipodia or ﬁlopodia [ 54 ] . Rearrangement of F - actin is directed by the Arp2 / 3 complex through induction of nucleation and branching of F - actin [ 54 – 56 ] and is regulated by small GTP - binding proteins such as Rac1 and Cdc42 [ 57 ] through Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) and WASP verprolin homology proteins ( WAVE ) [ 55 , 58 – 62 ] . N - WASP is a member of the WASP family of proteins [ 58 , 60 ] and is thought to be necessary for lamellipodia formation [ 63 ] . WAVE family proteins , including WAVE1 , - 2 , and - 3 [ 58 , 61 ] , induce both lamellipodia [ 64 – 66 ] and ﬁlopodia [ 67 ] . Among the WASP / WAVE family , WAVE2 has been the most intensively investigated and has been identiﬁed as functioning downstream of Rac [ 68 , 69 ] . Although direct interaction between Rac1 and WAVE2 is not detected in human breast cancer cells , Rac1 forms a complex with CLIP - 170 , a microtubule - binding protein [ 70 , 71 ] , an actin cross - linking protein IQGAP1 [ 33 , 34 ] , and kinesin - 1 , one of the major motor proteins [ 72 , 73 ] , under the growth - arrested conditions [ 74 ] ( Figure 1 ( a ) ) . CLIP - 170 and IQGAP1 bind microtubules and F - actin , respectively , and kinesin - 1 transports many cytoplasmic vesicles , proteins , and mRNAs as “cargo” toward the growing plus - ends of microtubules . Therefore , formation of the Rac1 , CLIP - 170 , IQGAP1 , and kinesin - 1 complex induces linking of Rac1 to both F - actin and microtubules by IQGAP1 and CLIP - 170 , respectively [ 74 , 75 ] . Depletion of CLIP - 170 expression causes growth factor - independent dissociation of IQGAP1 and kinesin - 1 from Rac1 and the promotion of random lamellipodia formation and invasion [ 74 ] . This suggests that CLIP - 170 may play a role in preventing cells from growth factor - independent lamellipodia formation and invasion , by tethering IQGAP1 and kinesin - 1 to Rac1 until stimulation by growth factors . Following the stimulation of cells with growth factor , IQGAP1 and kinesin - 1 dissociate from the Rac1 - CLIP - 170 complex [ 74 ] ( Figure 1 ( b ) ) . As lamellipodia formation and dissociation of IQGAP1 and kinesin - 1 are inhibited by a phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) inhibitor , the dissociation of IQGAP1 and kinesin - 1 from the Rac1 - CLIP - 170 complex is a prerequisite for lamellipodia forma - tion in response to growth factor stimulation ; this depends on PI3K that is activated by the activated growth factor receptor ( Figure 1 ( a ) ) . 3 . Membrane Targeting of WAVE2 along Microtubules In order to form lamellipodia , WAVE2 needs to be trans - ported to the leading edge of cells prior to lamellipodia formation [ 76 , 77 ] . WAVE2 is known to form multiprotein complexes that include Abi - 1 , Sra - 1 , Nap - 1 , and HSPC300 [ 78 – 80 ] . WAVE2 also forms a complex with IQGAP1 and kinesin - 1 in growth - arrested breast cancer cells ( Figure 1 ( a ) ) , and the amounts of these proteins relative to WAVE2 increase after stimulation of the cells with growth factor [ 65 ] ( Figure 1 ( b ) ) . As IQGAP1 and kinesin - 1 dissociate from the Rac1 - CLIP - 170 complex upon growth factor stimula - tion , without signiﬁcant alterations in the total amounts of IQGAP1 and kinesin - 1 , IQGAP1 and kinesin - 1 that are bound to WAVE2 might be proteins that previously dissociated from the complex ( Figure 1 ( b ) ) . In spite of this , additional binding of IQGAP1 and kinesin - 1 to WAVE2 appears to be insu ﬃ cient for WAVE2 translocation to the cell cortex . Many investigations have revealed that a p21 - activated protein kinase Pak1 [ 81 , 82 ] , which is one of the downstream e ﬀ ectors of Rac1 [ 81 , 83 , 84 ] , is constitutively associated with WAVE2 [ 66 ] ( Figure 2 ( a ) ) . Pak1 is thought to regulate not only actin reorganization through several reported substrates , including LIM kinase [ 85 ] , p41 - Arc [ 86 ] , and ﬁlamin [ 87 ] , but also microtubule dynamics through stathmin [ 88 – 90 ] , a microtubule destabilizing protein [ 91 , 92 ] . As direct interaction between Rac1 and Pak1 or WAVE2 is not detected in breast cancer cells , it is reasonable to assume that β PIX , the Pak - interacting nucleotide exchange factor of Rac / Cdc42 [ 93 ] , plays an important role in the signal transduction between Rac1 and Pak1 . β PIX is constitutively coupled to GIT1 and recruited to WAVE2 - bound Pak1 in response to growth factor stimulation [ 94 ] . Upon growth factor stimulation , the WAVE2 - bound Pak1 is activated and in turn phosphorylates stathmin [ 66 ] ( Figures 2 ( a ) and 2 ( b ) ) . The putative phosphorylation sites within stathmin are Ser16 , Ser25 , Ser38 , and Ser63 [ 95 ] . Among these , growth factor stimulation causes phospho - rylation at Ser25 and Ser38 , although phosphorylation at Ser38 alone is dependent on Pak1 in breast cancer cells [ 66 ] . This implies that serine / threonine protein kinases other than Pak1 phosphorylate stathmin at Ser25 . In either case , the microtubule destabilizing activity of stathmin is inacti - vated by phosphorylation [ 88 – 90 ] , and the phosphorylated stathmin is recruited to kinesin - 1 ; this complexes with WAVE2 and Pak1 and leads to the promotion of microtubule growth [ 66 ] ( Figure 2 ( b ) ) . Stathmin binding to kinesin - 1 was thought to be transient and to play a role in the transportation of tubulin heterodimers to the microtubule ends [ 95 ] ; however , stathmin binding to kinesin - 1 and tubulin heterodimers is maintained after growth factor stimulation [ 66 ] . This suggests the presence of a partner protein that facilitates the sustained linking of stathmin to the microtubule ends . The dynamic properties of micro - tubules are regulated by “plus - end - binding proteins” [ 96 – 98 ] that include CLIP , CLIP - associated protein ( CLASPs ) , dynein / dynactin , APC ( adenomatous polyposis coli ) , and EB - family proteins [ 99 – 101 ] .

Investigation of the stathmin - binding partners revealed that stathmin is consti - tutively associated with EB1 in the cytoplasm of growth - arrested cells [ 104 ] . After phosphorylation of stathmin by Pak1 , the phosphorylated stathmin - EB1 complex becomes associated , in an EB1 - dependent manner , with the ends of microtubules that bear the WAVE2 complex [ 104 ] . Deple - tion of stathmin does not inhibit microtubule growth but inhibits WAVE2 translocation and lamellipodia formation [ 66 ] , while EB1 depletion does not inhibit microtubule growth but inhibits stathmin binding to kinesin - 1 at the microtubule ends , WAVE2 translocation , and lamellipodia formation [ 104 ] . Taken together , growth factor - induced 4 Journal of Oncology Membrane Rac1 CLIP - 170 IQGAP1 Kinesin - 1 Microtubules GF - R GF ?

Journal of Oncology 5 and Pak1 - dependent phosphorylation of stathmin triggers the EB1 - mediated speciﬁc binding of the phosphorylated stathmin - EB1 complex to the WAVE2 - bearing microtubule ends , thereby leading to WAVE2 translocation and lamellipo - dia formation ( Figure 2 ( b ) ) . 4 . Control of Directional Lamellipodia Formation toward Growth Factor The process of cancer cell migration and invasion involves intravasation and extravasation of cells into and out of blood vessels [ 105 ] . Therefore , it is highly likely that cancer cell migration and invasion are directionally controlled by extracellular stimuli such as serum growth factors . If this theory is correct , promotion of persistent growth of the WAVE2 - bearing microtubules by the binding of the stathmin - EB1 complex seems to be insu ﬃ cient for the directional membrane anchoring of microtubules , that is , without the aid of partner proteins . For example , the end - binding proteins CLASPs link microtubule ends to the cell cortex by the phosphatidylinosito 3 , 4 , 5 - triphosphat - ( PIP 3 - ) binding protein LL5 β as a partner protein [ 106 ] . PIP 3 , a lipid component of the cytoplasmic membrane produced by PI3K , is known to be the membrane target of many pro - teins [ 107 – 111 ] that contain the pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain ( e . g . , PKB / Akt [ 112 , 113 ] ) , the basic region ( e . g . , WASP and WAVE2 [ 76 , 114 ] ) , or the IRSp53 / missing - in - metastasis ( MIM ) domain IMD ( e . g . , IRSp53 [ 115 , 116 ] ) . In lamellipodia - forming breast cancer cells , IRSp53 is constitu - tively associated with the WAVE2 complex that involves EB1 and plays an indispensable role in anchoring the complex to PIP 3 [ 117 ] . IRSp53 is a linker protein [ 118 – 120 ] that interacts with the proline - rich region of WAVE2 through its central Src - homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain [ 118 , 121 ] . Therefore , directional cell migration through lamellipodia formation may be regulated by the interaction between WAVE2 - bound IRSp53 as the PIP 3 - binding partner protein and PIP 3 as the membrane target molecule ; this suggests that the direction of membrane anchoring of microtubules that bear the WAVE2 complex is determined by the sites where PIP 3 is produced . In cells cultured in a chemotaxis chamber , only growth factor receptor in the membrane region facing high concentrations of growth factor was activated [ 104 ] . Local activation of the receptor causes recruitment of PI3K that in turn produces PIP 3 in close proximity to the activated receptor [ 104 ] ( Figure 3 ( a ) ) , thereby leading to local interaction between IRSp53 - bound WAVE2 and PIP 3 , and thus the directional formation of lamellipodia towards the growth factor source ( Figure 3 ( b ) ) . In the context of PIP 3 - binding proteins for lamellipodia formation , nonmuscle myosin IIA heavy chain MYH9 [ 122 – 124 ] has the ability to bind to both PIP 3 and WAVE2 [ 125 ] . Whereas MYH9 binding to WAVE2 is constitutive and requires the motor activity of myosin II , MYH9 binding to PIP 3 is induced only after WAVE2 membrane targeting by growth factor activation [ 125 ] . The binding of MYH9 to WAVE2 is probably through the interaction between the SH3 - like domain of MYH9 and the proline - rich domain of WAVE2 ; however , MYH9 lacks a PH domain , unlike myosin 1b and myosin X , which bind to PIP 3 through their PH domains [ 126 , 127 ] . Nevertheless , both MYH9 and the motor activity of nonmuscle myosin II are crucial for lamellipodia formation , as they induce convex F - actin arcs at the leading edge of cells [ 125 ] ( Figure 4 ) . Nonmuscle cells express multiple myosin II proteins , including myosin IIA , myosin IIB , and myosin IIC [ 122 – 124 ] ; these are impli - cated in regulating many cellular processes , including cell spreading , migration , and cytokinesis [ 128 – 131 ] , through generating the intracellular contractile forces and tension as conventional motor proteins by associating with F - actin . Thus , myosin IIA might also play a crucial role in cell migration through lamellipodia formation by providing the contractile forces and tension for the F - actin network initially rearranged by WAVE2 , IRSp53 , and PIP 3 through the variable turnover dynamics of F - actin [ 132 , 133 ] to form a convex arc at the leading edge of cells ( Figure 4 ) . As IRSp53 exhibits F - actin - bundling activity [ 134 , 135 ] , the formation of a lining of F - actin at the leading edge of cells might be mediated by nonmuscle myosin IIA in cooperation with IRSp53 . Among the proteins and molecules that are involved in regulation of lamellipodia formation , WAVE2 , N - WASP , PI3K , Rac1 , stathmin , and microtubules are also necessary for cell invasion [ 69 , 136 – 139 ] . Because cell invasion is accomplished by intensive accumulation of the F - actin bun - dles at the tips of cell protrusions where cells invade through the basement membrane matrix and narrow gaps [ 138 ] , the signaling and regulatory molecules leading to cell invasion may share many common molecules , leading to cell migra - tion through lamellipodia formation . 5 . Conclusion Cell migration and invasion are believed to require the formation of lamellipodia at the leading edge of cells by rearrangement of F - actin . Lamellipodia formation is preceded by membrane targeting of WAVE2 along micro - tubules . WAVE2 forms multiprotein complexes consisting of IQGAP1 , kinesin - 1 , Pak1 , IRSp53 , and nonmuscle myosin IIA . Membrane targeting of the WAVE2 complex is triggered by binding of IQGAP1 and kinesin - 1 , which are dissociated from the Rac1 - CLIP - 170 complex upon PI3K activation by the activated growth factor receptor . Concomitantly , WAVE2 - bound Pak1 after Rac1 - dependent activation phos - phorylates stathmin , followed by binding of the stathmin - EB1 complex to the microtubule ends that bear the WAVE2 complex ; this results in the promotion of persistent micro - tubule growth towards the cell cortex . The WAVE2 complex that targets the cell membrane is anchored by WAVE2 - bound IRSp53 and nonmuscle myosin IIA to PIP 3 ; PIP 3 is produced by PI3K near the growth factor receptor that is locally activated in the membrane region facing higher concentrations of growth factor . Colocalization of WAVE2 , IRSp53 , nonmuscle myosin IIA , and PIP 3 induces the directional formation of a convex F - actin arc lamellipodium .
