A fundamental goal of cell biology is to deﬁne the functions of proteins in the context of compartments that organize them in the cellular environment . Here we describe the construction and analysis of a collection of yeast strains expressing full - length , chromosomally tagged green ﬂuorescent protein fusion proteins . We classify these proteins , representing 75 % of the yeast proteome , into 22 distinct subcellular localization categories , and provide localization information for 70 % of previously unlocalized proteins . Analysis of this high - resolution , high - coverage localization data set in the context of transcriptional , genetic , and protein – protein interaction data helps reveal the logic of transcriptional co - regulation , and provides a comprehensive view of interactions within and between organelles in eukaryotic cells . Eukaryotic cells are organized into a complex network of mem - branes and compartments , which are specialized for various bio - logical functions . Comprehensive knowledge of the location of proteins within these cellular microenvironments is critical for understanding their functions and interactions ; this requires assay - ing the cell’s full complement of proteins . The complete genome sequence of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae 1 coupled with high - throughput experimental techniques has made systema - tic analyses of a eukaryotic proteome feasible . Recent studies have taken a genome - wide approach to analysing messenger RNA abundance and stability 2 , 3 , biochemical activity 4 , 5 , protein – protein interactions 6 – 9 , transcriptional regulation 10 , gene disruption pheno - types 11 – 14 and protein abundance 15 . Previous large - scale analyses of protein localization in S . cerevi - siae have depended on transposon - mediated random epitope tag - ging and plasmid - based overexpression of epitope - tagged proteins 11 , 16 . However , epitope tagging of partial open reading frames ( ORFs ) can interrupt important localization signals , and overexpression of proteins may saturate intracellular transport mechanisms , leading to abnormal subcellular localization . To cir - cumvent these potential problems , we generated a yeast strain collection expressing full - length proteins , tagged at the carboxy terminal end with green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) , from their endogenous promoters by inserting the coding sequence of Aequorea victoria GFP ( S65T ) 17 in - frame immediately preceding the stop codon of each ORF . With this strategy , wild - type levels and patterns of protein expression are minimally perturbed . Further - more , because GFP ﬂuorescence does not require external cofactors , GFP signal can be monitored in living cells without disrupting cellular integrity . We have analysed this strain collection using ﬂuorescence microscopy to comprehensively characterize protein subcellular localization in a simple eukaryotic cell . Construction and analysis of a GFP - tagged library We systematically tagged each ORF in its chromosomal location through oligonucleotide - directed homologous recombination ( Fig . 1a ) . For each of the 6 , 234 annotated ORFs 18 a pair of oligonucleotides was generated that had homology to the desired chromosomal insertion site at the 5 0 end of each primer and homology to a vector containing the GFP tag at the 3 0 end . These primers were used to amplify the GFP tag and an auxotrophic marker from a plasmid template 19 , and the resulting polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) products were transformed into a haploid yeast strain . Transformants were assayed by genomic PCR with one primer speciﬁc for the GFP tag and a second speciﬁc for each ORF , to determine whether the cassette had integrated at the appropriate locus . A total of 6 , 029 strains with chromosomally GFP - tagged ORFs were grown to mid - logarithmic phase in synthetic medium and analysed by ﬂuorescence microscopy ; 4 , 156 of these showed GFP signals above background levels ( Table 1 ) . Micrographs of each GFP - tagged strain ( Fig . 1b ; see also Sup - plementary Fig . S1 ) , lacking ORF identiﬁers , were independently evaluated by two scorers and initially classiﬁed into one or more of 12 subcellular localization categories ( Table 2 ) . We then reﬁned these categories by performing a series of co - localization experi - ments . Haploid reference strains expressing monomeric red ﬂuores - cent protein ( mRFP ) 20 fusions to proteins whose localization had been characterized previously ( Table 2 ) were mated to approxi - mately 700 GFP strains that were not assigned deﬁnitive localiza - tions by GFP microscopy alone , and the resulting diploid cells were analysed by ﬂuorescence microscopy ( Fig . 1c ) . On the basis of this analysis , proteins were assigned to an additional 11 localization categories ( Table 2 ) . All information was captured into a database ( http : / / yeastgfp . ucsf . edu ) . Subcellular localization of yeast proteins The 4 , 156 proteins for which we deﬁned subcellular localizations in the GFP library represent 75 % of the yeast proteome 15 , 21 , 22 . Our results provide localization data for about 70 % of previously unlocalized yeast proteins , constituting about 30 % of the proteome ( Fig . 2a ) . Over 90 % of the proteins visible in the GFP collectionwere also detected by western blot analysis of a collection of TAP ( tandem afﬁnity puriﬁcation ) - tagged strains 15 , suggesting that the false - positive rate in this study is extremely low . The distribution of protein subcellular localization reveals that , as expected , many proteins are found in the nucleus or cytoplasm , whereas 1 , 839 proteins , 44 % of the total observed , localize to other speciﬁc subcellular regions ( Fig . 2b ) . Notably , over 40 % of the proteins that we assigned to the cytoplasm , late Golgi / clathrin and lipid particle represent new localization assignments . There are limitations to the subcellular localizations in yeast discernible by ﬂuorescence microscopy ; for example , we cannot distinguish kine - tochore versus spindle pole body , or membrane versus lumen for mitochondria or the endoplasmic reticulum . However , use of the GFP tag and co - localization with RFP - tagged reference proteins allowed us to resolve many related subcellular compartments with articles NATURE | VOL 425 | 16 OCTOBER 2003 | www . nature . com / nature 686 © 2003 Nature PublishingGroup conﬁdence . For example , the nucleus , nuclear periphery and the endoplasmic reticulum are distinct ( Fig . 1b , top row ) , as are the vacuole and vacuolar membrane , and multiple compartments of the secretory pathway . This level of precision greatly facilitates our assignment of protein localization as well as integration with other genome - wide data sets . Previously published localization data from the Saccharomyces Genome Database ( SGD ) 18 , including data from earlier large - scale studies 11 , 16 , were available for a total of 2 , 526 proteins visible in the GFP library—we found that there was 80 % agreement between our data and those of the SGD . We also found that our localization assignments generally agree with those of the pioneering studies of the Snyder laboratory 11 , 16 . However , for those assignments that differ , our results show closer agreement with the SGD ( Supplemen - tary Fig . S2 ) . Direct comparison between our data and the results of a mass spectrometric analysis of the nuclear pore complex 23 ( NPC ) revealed that , of 29 identiﬁed NPC components , 25 were visible in our study : 23 proteins ( 92 % ) were localized to the nuclear periphery and one each was localized to the nucleus / cytoplasm and endoplas - mic reticulum . Furthermore , of 16 spindle - pole - body components identiﬁed by mass spectrometry 24 , all 14 of the proteins visible in this study were localized to the spindle pole . We found an additional 20 proteins localized to the nuclear periphery and 14 to the spindle pole ; of these , 11 had not been detected previously in the nuclear periphery and 7 had not been detected in the spindle pole ( Sup - plementary Table S1 ) . The strong correlation between the data we obtained by ﬂuorescence microscopy and localization data obtained by other methods supports the reliability of this study in deﬁning new protein localizations . A potential source of discrepancy between our data and those from other studies is that the C - terminal fusion of the GFP protein ( approximately 27 kDa ) may cause mislocalization through steric hindrance or interruption of critical C - terminal localization / reten - tion sequences ( Supplementary Table S2 ) . For example , the small GTP - binding protein Ras2 was localized to the nucleus and the cytoplasm in this study , but it is known to be localized to the plasma membrane due to modiﬁcation of its C terminus with palmitoyl and farnesyl groups 25 . Proteins localized to the cell wall 26 and subsets of proteins localized to the peroxisome 27 and endoplasmic reticulum 28 also contain C - terminal targeting signals , and these were often mislocalized in this study . Organellar proteomics of the nucleolus The identiﬁcation of subsets of proteins in various organelles is an initial step towards the understanding of biological processes at the cellular level . ‘Organellar proteomics’ studies 29 would beneﬁt especially from the comprehensive localization data for yeast proteins provided by this study . For example , we detected 164 proteins in the nucleolus in this study ; 82 of these overlap the 127 nucleolar proteins catalogued in the SGD , but another 82 are newly deﬁned ( Fig . 2c ) . Of the remaining 45 nucleolar proteins from the SGD , 28 were not visualized in our study , whereas the others were localized to the nucleus ( 7 proteins ) , nucleus / cytoplasm ( 7 pro - teins ) , nuclear periphery ( 2 proteins ) and cytoplasm ( 1 protein ) . These proteins may occupy the nucleolus in a transient fashion , at levels not detectable by our methods , or under conditions distinct from those of our study—mislocalization may also result from the GFP tag . A number of the nucleolar proteins found in this study are involved in ribosomal RNA transcription and processing and in ribosome biogenesis , in accordance with the classical role of the nucleolus ; for some of these proteins , we provide the ﬁrst direct demonstration that they reside or are enriched in the nucleolus ( Fig . 2d ) . Given that some nucleolar proteins are involved in cell cycle control and gene regulation 30 – 33 , it will be very interesting to investigate the functional roles of nucleolar proteins newly deﬁned in this study . It has been reported that essential proteins and orthologues are Figure 1 Microscopic analysis of yeast strains expressing GFP - tagged proteins .

Of the proteins localized to the nucleolus in this study , 99 proteins ( 60 % ) are known to be essential , substantially more than the 20 % required for viability in the proteome as a whole 12 , 14 . Recently , mass spectrometric analysis of the human nucleolus identiﬁed 271 proteins , 166 of which have homologues in yeast 34 ; 52 of these proteins are classiﬁed as nucleolar in this study ( Supplementary Table S3 ) . Of the 112 proteins remaining from the 164 proteins that we have detected in the yeast nucleolus , 73 have human homologues and 33 of these are localized to the nucleolus or have biological functions related to transcription and processing of rRNAs and ribosome biogenesis ( Supplementary Table S4 ) according to the Human Proteome Survey Database 35 . Given the enrichment of essential proteins in the yeast nucleolus and the enrichment of essential proteins and orthologues in related protein complexes from yeast and humans 8 , we expect that many of the remaining human homologues of yeast proteins detected in the nucleolus in this study will also be nucleolar proteins . Protein localization and mRNA co - expression Many genome - wide analyses have demonstrated that mRNA tran - script expression patterns are similar for groups of functionally related genes 2 , 36 – 38 ; mRNA abundance is also similar within certain cellular compartments 39 . However , transcriptional co - regulation has not been directly compared to subcellular protein localization on a proteome - wide scale . To assess the extent of this correlation , we made use of a study that identiﬁed 33 transcriptional ‘modules’ of genes with marked co - regulation based on analysis of over 1 , 000 microarray data sets reﬂecting the results of different mutant strain backgrounds or environmental perturbations 38 , 40 . For each module , the fraction of proteins with a given subcellular localization was calculated and divided by that fraction in the whole proteome to generate fold enrichment in each subcellular localization category ( Fig . 3a ) . We obtained statistically signiﬁcant enrichments ( one - sided binomial test with P , 0 . 05 ) for 19 of the 22 most highly expressed modules , indicating that co - localization is strongly cor - related with transcriptional co - expression and , by extension , with biological function . The combination of protein localization and transcriptional co - expression can be used to corroborate or predict the function of unnamed ORFs in a speciﬁc module . For example , YGL068W and YNL122C , both of which belong to the mitochondrial ribosomal protein transcriptional module , localize to the mitochondrion in our study , as do 13 other members of this module , strongly supporting the function predicted by the module ( Fig . 3b ) . Indeed , the sequence of YGL068W shows 49 % similarity to that of the human mitochondrial ribosomal protein L12 ( ref . 41 ) . Localization and co - regulation data can also be used to gain insight into biological function when proteins in a given transcrip - tion module are enriched in more than one localization category . This allows us to subdivide sets of co - expressed proteins , providing a level of information that cannot be gleaned solely from their classiﬁcation in the same module based on their expression proﬁles . For example , proteins in the G1 module ( representing processes coordinated at the G1 / S transition ) localize to three basic categories : nucleus , bud / bud neck and spindle pole ( Fig . 3c ) . The basic functions of proteins in the G1 module , where known , can be divided by localization ; proteins localized to the bud / bud neck are involved in bud formation , whereas nuclear proteins from this module are involved mainly in chromosome cohesion , transcrip - tion , and DNA replication , repair and recombination .

Comparison with genetic and physical interactions Recent genome - wide studies have sought to enumerate all protein – protein interactions that occur in S . cerevisiae 6 – 9 . Despite the large scale of these efforts , the agreement between studies 42 suggests that total coverage is poor and false - positive rates remain high . To interact physically proteins must exist in close proximity , at least transiently , suggesting that co - localization may be an effective means for evaluating hypothetical interactions . To assess the relationship between co - localization and interaction , we chose as a reference set the sum of all genetic and protein – protein inter - actions reported in the GRID database 43 . Although this set is certain to contain a considerable fraction of false - positive interactions , it was chosen to minimize systematic bias in individual screens that inevitably results from alternative interaction detection methods . We determined the subcellular localizations of each interacting protein pair from this reference set and the fraction of the total number of interactions occurring for each localization pair . A set of randomized protein pairs was also generated from the whole proteome , and localization pair statistics were collected on this set in the same way . We calculated the fold enrichment observed for each localization pair in our reference data set as compared with the randomized data set to generate an interaction matrix ( Fig . 4a ) . This analysis supports and extends interaction data from other studies . As expected , interactions are strongly enriched between proteins that co - localize ( one - sided binomial test with P , 0 . 001 ) , but the degree of enrichment varies widely by compartment . For example , interactions between cytoplasmic proteins are 1 . 3 - fold enriched above chance , whereas interactions between microtubule proteins are 56 - fold enriched above chance , implying that co - localization of two putative interacting proteins to the microtubule cytoskeleton provides better evidence of physical and functional interaction than the simple fact that they do co - localize . Of particular interest is that enrichment in interactions was observed between distinct localization categories in our study , shown as red off - diagonal circles in the matrix ( Fig . 4a ) . Such off - diagonal circles are indicative of functional relationships between subcellular localizations : they are neither the result of systematic errors from individual interaction data sets ( Supplementary Fig . S3 ) nor of proteins being assigned multiple localizations ( Supplemen - tary Fig . S4 ) . An extensive network of interactions occurs between proteins localized to the actin cytoskeleton and those localized to the bud neck ( Fig . 4b ) . Notably , some proteins not previously known to localize to these regions have known or predicted functions consistent with their assigned localizations . The Rho - GTPase activator protein Bem2 , for example , has been shown through genetic studies to be involved in bud growth , establishment of cell polarity , and organization and biogenesis of the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton and of the cell wall 44 . These functions are consistent both with localization to the bud neck and functional interaction with the actin cytoskeleton . Similarly , Chs7 is involved in cell wall chitin biosynthesis 45 , consistent with the role of certain bud neck proteins 46 , and Akl1 has a predicted role in the organiza - tion of the actin cytoskeleton 47 . The biological importance of statistically signiﬁcant interactions between localization categories in the GFP library is fully revealed when these interactions are considered in the context of a eukaryotic cell ( Fig . 4c ) . A network of interactions connects subcellular regions that are functionally and physically related . Strongly interconnected localizations can reﬂect dynamic interchange of proteins between compartments ; for example , compartments of the secretory path - Figure 3 Correlation between transcriptional co - regulation and subcellular localization . a , Theenrichmentofsubcellularlocalizations ( top ) exhibitedbyproteinsbelongingtoeach transcription module 38 ( left ) designated by biological function where applicable .

Intercompartmental interactions can also reﬂect close proximity and extensive physical association between localization categories , as is the case for the bud neck , the bud and the actin cytoskeleton . The interaction matrix provides an overview of communication between subcellular compartments as well as a template for evaluating the validity of protein – protein interactions from large - scale experimental or theoretical data sets . Discussion By creating a GFP - tagged yeast strain collection and database that covers three - quarters of the proteome and over two - thirds of previously unlocalized proteins , we have provided an experimental and informational resource to the scientiﬁc community . Although we have presented an analysis of the yeast proteome in a nominal resting state , the GFP library serves as a starting point for under - standing the complex state of ﬂux in the eukaryotic proteome that underlies the survival and development of an organism . The library provides a tool for analysing the global dynamics of the proteome in response to speciﬁc external stimuli or growth conditions over a selected period of time . Similarly , the library can be used in combination with high - throughput strain construction tech - niques 13 to assay the effects of deletion or mutation of a protein of interest on global protein localization . Complex regulatory net - works responsible for targeting proteins to speciﬁc cellular com - partments can thus be systematically dissected . We have shown that the combination of high - resolution , high - accuracy , proteome - wide localization information with data from other proteomics - scale studies provides an independent dimension of information that reveals patterns not visible within a single data set . The localization data from the GFP library can conﬁrm and extend predictions based on trends within a single data set ; if proteins grouped together in a given data set have a common localization , the prediction of common function is strengthened . This is particularly useful in the case of proteins for which little functional data exists . The localization data also make it possible to subdivide groups of proteins related by genome - wide trends in other data sets , indicating that one group may be composed of subsets of proteins with even more speciﬁc , separate biological roles . A comparative proteomics approach promises to reveal important features of basic cellular processes , improving our understanding of S . cerevisiae and of the proteins and pathways conserved among eukaryotes . A Methods Construction of GFP - tagged yeast strains To construct a chromosomally GFP - tagged library , 6 , 234 pairs of gene - speciﬁc oligonucleotide primers were synthesized , each of which had been designed to share complementary sequences to the GFP tag - marker cassette at the 3 0 end and contain 40 basepairs ( bp ) ofhomologywithaspeciﬁcgeneofinteresttoallow in - framefusionofthe GFP tag at the C - terminal coding region of the gene . Gene - speciﬁc cassettes containing a C - terminally positioned GFP tag were then generated by PCR using as a template pFA6a – GFP ( S65T ) – His3MX , which contains the Schizosaccharomyces pombe his5 (cid:135) gene and permitsselectionoftransformedstrainsinhistidine - free media 19 . Thehaploid parent yeast strain ( ATCC 201388 : MAT a his3 D 1leu2 D 0 met15 D 0 ura3 D 0 ) was transformed with the PCR products , and strains were selected in SD medium ( synthetic medium plus dextrose , Difco ) lacking histidine .

Strainsrepresenting 6 , 029ORFsweresuccessfully tagged withGFP ( Table 1 ) , and independent strains from two to six selected colonies from each ORF were analysed by ﬂuorescence microscopy . Microscopic imaging of GFP - tagged strains Aliquots of strains grown to mid - logarithmic phase in SD medium lacking histidine were analysed in 96 - well glass - bottom microscope slides ( BD Falcon ) pre - treated with concanavalin A ( 50 m gml 2 1 ) to ensure cell adhesion .

Localization category reﬁnement by co - localization Subcellular localizations that could not be assigned readily by GFP ﬂuorescence alone— typically classiﬁed as punctate or non - uniform nuclear—were resolved by mating the GFP - taggedstrainstostrainsexpressingreferenceproteins ( Table2 ) fusedtomRFP 20 . The coding sequence for mRFP was ampliﬁed by PCR from its parent vector ( pRSET – mRFP1 ) 20 and inserted into pFA6a – KanMX6 , which carries the Escherichia coli kanamycin - resistance gene 19 , to create the plasmid pFA6a – mRFP – KanMX6 . This vector was then used to generate gene - speciﬁc cassettes to yield reference strains expressing C - terminally mRFP - tagged proteins .

The GFP - tagged strains were then mated with at least one of the mRFP - tagged reference strains in SD medium lacking lysine and methionine , and the resulting diploid strains were analysed by microscopy to generate GFP , RFP , DIC and GFP – RFP merged images . Haploid strains exhibiting potential non - uniform mitochondrial GFP patterns were subjected to the same microscopic analysis using the mitochondrion - speciﬁc dye MitoTracker red CMXRos ( Molecular Probes ) .
