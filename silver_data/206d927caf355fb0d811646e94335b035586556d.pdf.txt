ProxiFit can either be deployed in wearable mode ( left ) or in signage mode ( right ) . Both modes deliver pervasive exercise classification and repetition counting . For wearable mode , either a smartwatch or a smartphone is worn on the user‚Äôs wrist . For signage mode , a smartphone is mounted to the holder in front of the user with line - of - sight visibility . ABSTRACT Although many works bring exercise monitoring to smartphones and smartwatches , inertial sensors used in such systems require the device to be in motion to detect exercises . We demonstrate our full paper ProxiFit , a practical on - device exercise monitoring system capable of classifying and counting exercises despite the device being still . ProxiFit remotely detects adjacent exercises with mag - netic field fluctuations induced by the motions of ferrous exercise equipment . Novel proximal sensing nature of ProxiFit ( 1 ) extends coverage of wearable exercise monitoring to exercises that do not involve device motion such as lower - body machine exercise , and ( 2 ) brings a new off - body exercise monitoring mode with line - of - sight ‚àó Co - corresponding authors .

Extensive efforts have been put into the pervasive tracking of gym exercises . Among various approaches , systems based on personal commodity mobile / wearable such as smartphones or smartwatches have unique merits of zero hardware investment , gym - independent applicability , and keeping gym - goers‚Äô privacy from third - parties . However , the main sensing modality of exercise monitoring systems on commodity mobile / wearable is inertial features from accelerometer and gyroscope [ 14 , 15 , 33 , 34 , 46 ] , which requires the device to be in motion to detect exercises . This limitation prevents monitoring exercises that do not involve device motion , such as lower - body machine exercises and free - weight exercises on the non - device - worn arm . In addition , smartphones lose screen visibility , which is their main interface , as they must be put in motion by being worn on the user‚Äôs body to monitor exercises . We present ProxiFit , a practical on - device exercise monitoring system capable of classifying and counting exercises without the motion of the device itself . Unlike prior works that use inertial fea - tures , ProxiFit exploits the built - in magnetometer of smartwatches and smartphones to enable proximity sensing of exercise equip - ment . Weight exercise equipment is often made of ferrous metal , and thus have faint self - magnetism . When the equipment is in mo - tion , its self - magnetism influences the surrounding magnetic field . However , the magnetic disturbances around unmagnetized iron are extremely weak [ 12 , 37 ] , and the magnetic signature of each piece of equipment is determined at its annealing process [ 5 , 13 , 17 ] . These constraints mandate a robust yet data - efficient classifier as the model should be trained per - instance manner . ProxiFit devises a simple yet efficient classifier that overcomes both constraints to successfully detect , classify , and count adjacent exercises remotely . With new proximity magnetic sensing modality , ProxiFit imple - ments two modes , namely wearable and signage modes . Wearable mode targets wrist - worn wearables such as a smartwatch , where ProxiFit newly brings the capabilities to monitor a new category of exercises without device motion such as lower - body machine exercises or free - weight exercises done on the non - device - worn arm . Signage mode is a new off - body exercise monitoring setup for smartphones featuring line - of - sight screen visibility , where a smart - phone is mounted in front of the user during exercise . The user may watch a video player or a self - monitoring & guidance app [ 32 ] . Both modes provide real - time exercise classification and repetition counting via auditory feedback [ 27 , 28 , 49 ] . Refer to Figure 1 for the real - world demonstration of ProxiFit in both modes . 2 RELATED WORKS Exercise monitoring on mobile . There have been other ap - proaches to overcome coverage limitations of inertial exercise mon - itoring on commodity mobile devices . A most straightforward approach is to introduce more devices so that they can sense the inertial movements of different limbs [ 7 , 25 , 42 , 56 ] or even dumbbells [ 49 , 53 ] and various equipment [ 26 , 45 , 47 ] . While this is the most intuitive solution , it requires users to buy X Y Z Rep 1 Rep 2 Rep 3 Rep 4 Rep 5 Figure 2 : Exemplary trajectories and their primary compo - nent vectors of hip abduction repetitions . There exist notice - able drift and deviation between repetitions . However , the primary component vector of each repetition is consistent . and wear extra devices . Detachable smartwatch [ 29 ] avoids the burden of equipping extra devices by allowing the smartwatch to be relocated on - demand . However , it poses practicality concerns where users need to frequently change the device position during workouts . Fu et al . [ 20 , 21 ] suggests acoustic Doppler sensing to detect nearby activities . While it is capable of detecting exercise without device motion , susceptibility to multi - paths and ambient noise in crowded gyms would limit its deployment [ 55 ] . Bian et al . [ 6 ] proposes a wearable capacitive coupling sensor to detect the motions of body parts apart from the limb where the sensor is worn . However , such a sensor is not yet available on commodity mobile devices , and its accuracy needs refinement for practical deployment . Magnetic sensing . Ambient magnetic field sensing based on a commodity mobile device has been studied for real - life problems , e . g . , indoor localization [ 3 , 16 , 18 , 19 , 38 , 48 , 51 , 54 ] , NFC [ 43 ] , and daily hygiene [ 24 ] . Other side of works track magnetic fields to discover cyber - physical vulnerabilities [ 12 , 37 ] , driver monitor - ing [ 23 ] , natural user interfaces [ 4 , 8 ‚Äì 10 , 22 , 39 ‚Äì 41 , 44 ] , and mode of transport [ 11 ] . ProxiFit is the first exercise monitoring system that satisfies the fol - lowing constraints towards high practicality ; ( 1 ) supports exercises without device motion , ( 2 ) only requires a single commercial off - the - shelf ( COTS ) smartwatch or smartphone , ( 3 ) preserves intended use of the device ( i . e . , the smartwatch is worn on wrist / smartphone screen is visible to the user ) , and ( 4 ) assumes no external instru - mentation . 3 METHODS Following is a brief description of ProxiFit architecture . Further details can be found in the full paper [ 30 ] . While magnetic sensing enables detecting exercise equipment without device motion , its faint signal poses a challenge for accurate exercise classification and repetition counting .

Extracting useful information from such noisy magnetic field signals requires careful feature crafting based on the characteristics of weight exercises ‚Äì repetitive motion and consistent directionality of motion . Figure 2 represents five continuous repetitions of the hip abduc - tion exercise . Even though each repetition is executed right after one another , there exist prominent drift and deviations between repetitions . Therefore , bespoke methods are to be devised to ensure robustness . 3 . 1 Sampling Data ProxiFit collects accelerometer , gyroscope , and magnetometer data at 100 Hz . IMUs ( i . e . , accelerometer and gyroscope ) are solely used for efficient exercise detection and frame normalization , while exer - cise classification and counting are performed with magnetometer data . Data is bundled into 3 - second windows with 2 . 5 - second over - lap to contain at least a single repetition of exercise without too much processing delay . 3 . 2 Exercise Detection We employ a light - weight exercise detector in favor of efficiency . The detector adopts low - acceleration thresholding to find wear - able mode exercises , based on the observation that a user‚Äôs wrist is unnaturally still during target exercises . For signage mode , au - tocorrelation is alternatively used to detect the periodic motion of exercise equipment . 3 . 3 Frame Normalization In wearable mode , the orientation of the device varies by users‚Äô physiques , how users wear the device , and slight instance - wise dif - ferences in grips to hold exercise equipment . The frame normalizer negates such rotational deviations by transforming each sample according to its frame of reference . 3 . 4 Exercise Classification The wearable and signage modes both utilize the same classifier architecture , as the fundamental concept of magnetic sensing is applicable to both modes . We handcrafted the features by carefully observing the magnetic trajectories of repeated exercises . Despite the trajectories represented in Figure 2 appearing erratic , we ob - serve that the primary component vector of the magnetic trace is consistent for each repetition , as illustrated by the arrows . There - fore , we apply principal component analysis to extract the primary component vector of the given window . Features are then heuristi - cally constructed with the primary component vector of the raw signal , which is then fed into a support vector machine ( SVM ) for classification . Due to the instance - specific nature of each weight machine‚Äôs magnetic signature , we train a separate model for each gym . Loading the model for the current gym is straightforwardly done by PoI - level localization techniques [ 31 , 36 ] . 3 . 5 Repetition Counting Exercise monitoring systems often look for peaks on the target signal to count repetitions . However , na√Øve peak counting is not 153 UbiComp / ISWC ‚Äô23 Adjunct , October 08 ‚Äì 12 , 2023 , Cancun , Quintana Roo , Mexico Kim et al . 0 1 2 3 4 Time ( s ) 0 1 2 3 4 C W T S c a l e ( H z ) 1 0 5 1 st 2 nd 3 rd 4 th 5 th 6 th 7 th 8 th 9 th 10 th ( a ) Continuous wavelet transform of an exercise session 1 st 2 nd 3 rd 4 th 5 th 6 th 7 th 8 th 9 th 10 th I n t e n s i t y ( / w O ff s e t f o r v i s u a li z a t i o n ) 0 1 2 3 4 Time ( s ) 0 1 2 3 4 C W T S c a l e ( H z ) 1 0 5 ( b ) Peak counting results alongside varying scales of CWT Figure 4 : Visualization of continuous wavelet transform and ProxiFit‚Äôs automatic scale finding algorithm applicable to magnetic sensing due to the noisy nature of the mag - netic field . Instead , continuous wavelet transform ( CWT ) is applied to better extract periodic features . Figure 4 showcases the result of the continuous wavelet transform . To count repetitions , peak counting is applied alongside a horizontal line ( or a scale ) of CWT . Figure 4b plots each line and its peaks on three scales , which are also annotated as arrows in Figure 4a . Despite observable periodicity , noise introduces false peaks on the 1 . 25 Hz and 1 . 5 Hz scales . ProxiFit automatically counts peaks alongside multiple scales and chooses the one with the least interval variance between peaks , which is 1 . 75 Hz in this case . 4 EVALUATION ProxiFit is tested on both wearable and signage modes for exercise classification and repetition counting . Figure 3 shows exercises that ProxiFit is tested on . Note that , exercises both with and without device motion are tested for wearable mode . We test the end - to - end performance of wearable mode ProxiFit under a real - life gym workout scenario . MiLift [ 52 ] , an IMU - based exercise monitoring system , is integrated to support exercises with device motion , as a realistic exercise routine would include both cat - egories of exercises . Subjects are asked to freely perform workouts in a gym with ProxiFit running on a wrist - worn smartphone , mim - icking a smartwatch . In 11 . 6 hours of end - to - end sessions , ProxiFit achieved 93 . 1 % classification accuracy as seen in Figure 5 , with an average counting error of 0 . 77 reps per 10 - rep session . We also test classification and repetition counting accuracy in signage mode . Average classification accuracy was 97 . 7 % when left and right arm free weights are seen as discrete exercise classes , and was 100 % under side - agnostic evaluation . The average counting error was 0 . 69 reps per 10 - rep session . ProxiFit is also tested against longitudinal aging , displacement , interference from adjacent machines , weather variances , and user ùëÜ‚àíùê∏ùë•ùëíùëüùëêùëñùë†ùëí ( ProxiFit ) ( 95 . 1 % ) ùëÄ‚àíùê∏ùë•ùëíùëüùëêùëñùë†ùëí ( MiLift ) ( 94 . 2 % ) Figure 5 : Confusion matrix of end - to - end evaluation on wear - able mode ProxiFit .

For more information , please refer to the full paper [ 30 ] . 5 DEMONSTRATION ProxiFit employs both wearable and signage modes , which of each supports both machine exercises and free - weight exercises . At the demo venue , we will showcase the signage mode as it allows users to quickly participate without wearing / taking off a device . Also , we focus on free - weight exercises , as such exercises involve portable equipment that can be brought to the demonstration venue . We will prepare free - weight exercise equipment and install an iPhone running signage mode of ProxiFit on a holder . Participants can come by to pick up a dumbbell and perform simple weight exer - cises in front of it . ProxiFit will automatically detect ongoing exer - cise and count repetitions . While the main work of ProxiFit includes two dumbbell exercises , the demonstration variant of ProxiFit is tailored towards demo - friendly free - weight exercises including , but not limited to , biceps curl and other dumbbell exercises that can be performed while standing , along with kettlebell exercises .
