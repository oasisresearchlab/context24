Author ( s ) : Frost , James Edward Abstract : The images of tarot cards are rich in symbols which invite interpretation and speculation . In this paper I explain the predominant uses of the tarot cards . In parts of Europe the tarot is still played as a game ; in Britain and the United States it is used for divination . Particular attention is given to the writings of Antoine Court de Gebelin and Jean - Baptiste Alliette , in the eighteenth century , as key turning points in the use of the cards from gaming to fortune - telling or cartomancy . As the practice of visual interpretation and the disclosure of truth are central to divination with the tarot , I refer to the philosophical hermeneutics of Hans - Georg Gadamer as an appropriate way of understanding the practice . I utilize Gadamer ' s notions of play , festival and symbol to explain the relationship between gaming and reading the cards . From this I am able to formulate an understanding of cartomancy as a form of serious play , related to but differing from game play in the nature of its encounter with the symbol .
