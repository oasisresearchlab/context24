A RT I C L E S Mechanical regulation of a molecular clutch deﬁnes force transmission and transduction in response to matrix rigidity Alberto Elosegui - Artola 1 , Roger Oria 1 , 2 , Yunfeng Chen 3 , 4 , Anita Kosmalska 1 , 2 , Carlos Pérez - González 1 , 2 , Natalia Castro 1 , Cheng Zhu 3 , 4 , 5 , Xavier Trepat 1 , 2 , 6 , 7 and Pere Roca - Cusachs 1 , 2 , 8 Cell function depends on tissue rigidity , which cells probe by applying and transmitting forces to their extracellular matrix , and then transducing them into biochemical signals . Here we show that in response to matrix rigidity and density , force transmission and transduction are explained by the mechanical properties of the actin – talin – integrin – ﬁbronectin clutch . We demonstrate that force transmission is regulated by a dynamic clutch mechanism , which unveils its fundamental biphasic force / rigidity relationship on talin depletion . Force transduction is triggered by talin unfolding above a stiffness threshold . Below this threshold , integrins unbind and release force before talin can unfold . Above the threshold , talin unfolds and binds to vinculin , leading to adhesion growth and YAP nuclear translocation . Matrix density , myosin contractility , integrin ligation and talin mechanical stability differently and nonlinearly regulate both force transmission and the transduction threshold . In all cases , coupling of talin unfolding dynamics to a theoretical clutch model quantitatively predicts cell response . Cell function 1 and major processes in cancer 2 and development 3 are driven by the mechanical rigidity of tissues , which cells probe through their contractile and adhesive molecular machinery . This machinery is composed of dynamic molecular bonds between the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) , integrins , adaptor proteins and the force - generating actomyosin cytoskeleton , forming a mechanical link generally referred to as a ‘molecular clutch’ 4 – 6 . To sense and respond to rigidity , cells employ this molecular clutch first to transmit forces to their surrounding matrix 5 , 7 – 9 , and then to transduce those forces into biochemical signals leading to transcriptional regulation in the nucleus 10 . The first step of force transmission has been modelled by introducing the dynamic properties of the clutch in computational simulations 4 , in a way that can predict the eﬀects of adhesion mediated by diﬀerent integrin types 5 . However , the fundamental prediction of such a clutch model is a biphasic force / rigidity relationship , which is in direct contradiction with the monotonically increasing curves observed in most systems 11 – 15 . Further , the key molecular clutch elements driving force transmission remain to be identified . The second step of force transduction is likely to be mediated by force - induced molecular conformational changes , which could occur at the level of ECM molecules , integrins , adaptor proteins and ion channels , among others 16 , 17 . Among all potential mechanosensing molecules , the adaptor protein talin is a particularly interesting candidate because it directly links integrins to actin , is stretched as cells transmit forces to the ECM 18 , 19 , and mediates cellular response to force 20 , 21 . Further , talin has been observed to unfold under force in vitro , exposing previously cryptic binding domains to vinculin 22 , which then binds and is likely to be activated 23 . However , if and how talin unfolding , or conformational changes in any other molecule , mediate rigidity sensing is unknown . Thus , how force transmission and transduction are coupled in response to rigidity remains unresolved . RESULTS Talin sets a stiffness threshold that increases force transmission and triggers force transduction To understand how rigidity regulates both force transmission and transduction , we used talin 1 − / − mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( with © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

On the softer substrates , cellular forces increased with rigidity , and talin depletion had no eﬀect ( Fig . 1a , b ) . However , forces sharply diverged above a threshold rigidity of 5kPa , increasing and decreasing for control cells and depleted cells , respectively ( Fig . 1a , b ) . In control cells , this threshold coincided with the growth of focal adhesions rich in vinculin ( Fig . 1c , d ) and NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 18 | NUMBER 5 | MAY 2016 © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

In contrast , talin - depleted cells spread on gels , but did not develop focal adhesions or localize YAP to the nucleus at any rigidity ( Fig . 1c – f ) . To confirm those results , we blocked talin function in control cells by a mechanism alternative to shRNA . We transfected cells with a dominant negative talin head mutant ( L325R ) that displaces endogenous talin for integrin binding , but does not activate integrins or link them to the cytoskeleton 24 . On stiﬀ substrates , increasing levels of talin head L325R expression progressively reduced force transmission to the levels of talin - depleted cells ( Fig . 1a , b and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) , and abrogated adhesion growth and YAP nuclear translocation as expected ( Fig . 1c – f ) . In contrast and consistently with shRNA results , talin head L325R expression had no eﬀect on soft substrates ( Fig . 1a – f and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Further reinforcing the importance of the talin - dependent threshold , it also marked the recruitment of integrins and phosphorylated FAK to adhesions ( Fig . 2a – d and Supplementary Fig . 3 ) , and the association of adhesions to stress fibres ( Fig . 2c , d ) . Those results provide important insights into the two steps required for rigidity sensing , force transmission and force transduction . Regarding force transmission , we show that the core long - standing prediction of the clutch adhesion model ( a biphasic force / rigidity curve , so far only partially observed in neuronal filopodia 4 ) is correct , but fully unveiled only in the absence of talin - mediated reinforcement . Regarding force transduction , we show that it is triggered above a rigidity threshold in a talin - dependent manner , leading to adhesion growth , downstream biochemical signalling and YAP activation . Regulation of talin unfolding by a molecular clutch can explain force transmission and transduction in response to rigidity We then assessed whether the eﬀects of rigidity and talin could be mediated by known force regulators such as myosin phosphorylation and cell spreading . Whereas myosin phosphorylation levels slightly fluctuated as a function of substrate stiﬀness and talin depletion ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) , those fluctuations did not correlate with transmitted forces . As reported previously 5 , cell areas increased with rigidity , reaching a plateau at about 5kPa ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . However , no significant diﬀerences were measured between control and talin - depleted cells . Further , the threshold rigidity leading to adhesion growth , YAP activation and force decrease in talin - depleted cells was not associated with cell spreading changes . Thus , neither myosin phosphorylation nor cell spreading could account for the eﬀects of talin , or the rigidity threshold . Alternatively , the rigidity threshold may result from the regulation of talin unfolding by the ECM – integrin – talin – actin clutch . To 542 © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Myosin motors pull with a speed v on actin ﬁlaments , which are connected to a compliant substrate ( represented as a linear elastic spring of varying rigidity ) through several parallel molecular clutches .

For clutches mediated by either integrin type , at low forces integrins unbind faster , releasing force transmission and preventing talin unfolding . However , unfolding becomes faster than unbinding above a threshold force ( Fig . 3b ) . This threshold force for unfolding could be further modulated by unbinding events in integrin – talin – actin bonds , which would decrease overall clutch unbinding times , or by load sharing between talin and other adaptor molecules , which would decrease the load on talin and slow unfolding . Independently of its specificvalue , aforcethresholdfortalinunfoldingthusemerges , which may mediate the rigidity threshold observed in Fig . 1 . Toevaluatethispossibility , wedevelopedacomputationalapproach to couple talin unfolding to a clutch model 5 ( see Supplementary Note for details ) . This model considers a given number of myosin motors progressively pulling on an actin fibre , which is bound to a deformable substrate through molecular clutches formed by adaptor proteins ( such as talin ) , integrins and fibronectin ( Fig . 3c ) . Once the clutches bind according to a given binding rate , fibre contraction deforms the substrate and results in progressive force loading , which is slow or fast on soft or stiﬀ substrates , respectively . This force loading leads to either clutch unbinding or talin unfolding . If talin unfolds , vinculin binds , leading to adhesion reinforcement and growth 20 and integrin recruitment . In the absence of talin unfolding , integrins are not recruited , but force is still assumed to be transmitted between integrins and actin through other adaptor proteins 27 . If talin unfolding is not considered , we recapitulate the fundamental prediction of the clutch model 4 , that is , a biphasic force / rigidity curve with an optimal rigidity of maximum force transmission ( Fig . 3d , blue line ) . Below the optimal rigidity , force loads so slowly that clutches unbind from the ECM before exerting significant forces . Above the optimal rigidity , force loading is so fast that clutches unbind from the ECM before other clutches have time to bind , reducing cooperativity and decreasing total force transmission . The presence of talin does not aﬀect the curve at low rigidities , where forces are too low to allow unfolding . However , above a rigidity threshold , force loading becomes fast enough to allow talin unfolding before integrin unbinding . This leads to vinculin binding and integrin NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 18 | NUMBER 5 | MAY 2016 © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

Error bars , s . e . m . recruitment , increasing integrin binding and force transmission , and eliminating the biphasic relationship ( Fig . 3d , red line ) . In all cases , force transmission resists actin contraction , leading to a negative correlation between force and actin flow ( Fig . 3e ) . The model closely reproduced our force measurements ( see Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Note for model parameters and assumptions ) . Confirming the validity of the clutch hypothesis , actin flows correlated negatively with forces , and could also be reproduced by the model using the same parameters ( Fig . 3e , f , and Supplementary Videos 1 and 2 ) . Thus , control of talin unfolding by force transmitted through the ECM – actin clutch can explain how rigidity regulates both force transmission , and the threshold for mechanotransduction . The rigidity threshold is mediated by talin unfolding under force and subsequent vinculin binding We then carried out several experiments to validate this mechanism molecularly . First , we rescued talin 2 - depleted cells with either full - length ( FL ) talin 1 or two separate fragments , the talin 1 rod and the talin 1 head . FL talin 1 rescued rescue force generation , adhesion growth and YAP localization to control levels , confirming that talin 1 and 2 had the same eﬀect 20 , 21 . However , neither the talin rod nor the head rescued the phenotype of depleted cells ( Fig . 4a – d ) . As the talin head is suﬃcient to activate integrins 21 , 28 , this shows that integrin activation without force transmission through talin was not suﬃcient to trigger a rigidity response . Confirming this , FL talin mutants that do not bind integrins ( W359A ) or bind but do not activate integrins ( L325R ) 24 did not rescue force generation or YAP localization above the rigidity threshold ( Fig . 4e , f ) . Second , we generated a talin mutant ( FL talin 1 IVVI ) containing four point mutations shown to increase the force required for talin unfolding ( that is , the force where unfolding rates become faster than refolding rates ) from 5 to 8pN ( ref . 25 ) . This should increase the threshold rigidity for unfolding , displacing the eﬀect of talin to higher rigidities . Accordingly , cells rescued with IVVI instead of wild - type talin diverged from talin - depleted cells ( in terms of force generation , adhesion growth and YAP translocation ) at a higher rigidity ( 15 instead of 11kPa ; Fig . 5a – d ) . This result demonstrates that adhesion growth and YAP activation in response to rigidity are triggered by talin unfolding , and that this response can be regulated by modulating talin mechanical stability . 544 © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

WetransfectedcontrolcellswithVD1 , a vinculin fragment that is dominant over endogenous vinculin for talin binding 29 but prevents normal vinculin function 30 , 31 owing to the lack of remaining functional domains . Blocking vinculin function through VD1 transfection had the same eﬀect as talin depletion , that is , forces decreased at high rigidities , and YAP remained cytosolic ( Fig . 5e , f and Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . VD1 formed large focal adhesions above but not below the rigidity threshold ( Fig . 5g ) , confirming that vinculin binding was specifically triggered above the threshold . As a negative control , transfection of a VD1 mutant ( A50I ) with reduced aﬃnity for talin had no eﬀect ( Fig . 4e – g ) . Neither VD1 nor VD1 A50I had any eﬀect on talin - depleted cells ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Collectively , those data show that force unfolds talin above a rigidity threshold , leading to vinculin binding , adhesion growth and YAP translocation to the nucleus . The molecular determinants of the clutch regulate force transmission and transduction Finally , weanalysedtheroleofdiﬀerentclutchmoleculardeterminants predicted to regulate force transmission 32 , 33 . First , if available clutches are decreased ( by reducing substrate fibronectin coating density , see Supplementary Fig . 6 ) , overall force transmission should be reduced . However , force loading per clutch increases because actomyosin contractility is distributed among fewer clutches , triggering talin unfolding , reinforcement and YAP translocation at a lower rigidity threshold . As the rigidity corresponding to peak force transmission in depleted cells is also determined by force loading 32 , 33 , it also shifts to a lower value . If fibronectin coating is increased , the inverse eﬀect is expected . Second , reducing the binding rate of integrins ( by partially blocking integrins with the GPen peptide ) should reduce the number of bound clutches , leading to eﬀects similar to those of reducing fibronectin coating .

In all force quantiﬁcations , the grey lines show the minimum detectable force level , which increased with rigidity and reached the values measured for talin - depleted cells at high rigidities .

See Supplementary Table 3 for sample numbers and statistical analysis . Error bars , s . e . m . integrins are partially blocked , impairing reinforcement and adhesion growth on talin unfolding . This counters the eﬀect of the increased loading per integrin , leading to reduced overall force transmission and a shift to lower rigidities of the peak force in depleted cells , but no major change in the threshold rigidity for reinforcement and YAP translocation . Third , decreasing myosin contractility ( by using diﬀerent concentrations of blebbistatin ) should reduce force loading , increasing the rigidity threshold for talin unfolding and YAP activation . Similarly , the force peak in depleted cells should shift to higher rigidities , and reduce its height . All of those predictions 546 © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 18 | NUMBER 5 | MAY 2016 A RT I C L E S were verified experimentally ( Fig . 6 ) . Although model predictions did not always provide an exact quantitative match , they consistently predicted the shifts in overall forces , the rigidity threshold at which forces diverge between control and depleted cells , and the position of the force peak in depleted cells . Those predictions were obtained by adjusting only the relevant parameters in each case : number of fibronectin molecules ( n f ) for fibronectin coating ( Fig . 6a – c ) , integrin binding and recruitment rates ( k ont and d add ) for GPen ( Fig . 6d – f ) , and number of myosin motors ( n m ) for blebbistatin ( Fig . 6g – i ) . In all cases , YAP localized to the nucleus at the same rigidity threshold where measured forces diverged between control and depleted cells ( Fig . 6j , k , l ) . Thus , force transmission was systematically modulated by the molecular determinants of the clutch , leading to mirror shifts in the thresholds for talin unfolding and YAP activation . DISCUSSION Our results unveil the mechanisms by which microenvironment rigidity regulates both force transmission and transduction , and reconcile previous findings . Indeed , even though cell – ECM adhesion is widely accepted to be mediated by a molecular clutch mechanism , its predicted biphasic force / rigidity relationship is inconsistent with monotonically increasing trends observed in most systems 11 – 14 . Here we show that the biphasic force / rigidity relationship is normally masked by talin - mediated reinforcement and adhesion growth , and is fully unveiled only on talin depletion . This depletion allowed us to test the molecular determinants of force transmission , revealing that its regulation by rigidity , ECM coating density , cell contractility or integrin activity fully abides by the clutch model first proposed eight years ago 4 , 32 , 33 . This leads to interesting and counter - intuitive results , such as that decreasing ECM coating enhances the mechanical response ( Fig . 6j ) , or that mild myosin inhibition ( 5 – 15 µ M ) increases cell – ECM force transmission in talin - depleted cells for a specific rigidity range ( 10 – 15kPa , Fig . 6g , h ) . This is because although overall contractility is reduced , the force peak is shifted to higher rigidities . Whereasinthisworkwefocusedonfibronectinsubstratesboundto cells through α 5 β 1 - and α v β 3 - mediated catch bonds , we note that the emergence of a threshold for talin unfolding does not require catch bonds . Even if integrins behaved as slip bonds , a rigidity threshold wouldoccuriftheforce / unbindingandforce / unfoldingcurvescrossed at a given force . Given the extremely steep decay in talin unfolding times as a function of force ( Fig . 3a ) , this is likely to happen in most scenarios . Further , talin unfolding at low forces would also be prevented by very fast refolding rates , a factor that was also included in our modelling . Thus , the force and rigidity threshold for talin unfolding is likely to apply in many physiological scenarios , and could be regulated by several factors . First , clutch unbinding events at the level of integrin – talin – actin bonds could increase overall clutch unbinding rates , displacing the threshold to higher forces / rigidities . This eﬀect would alter the specific values of model output , but would not modify the overall trends of the force / rigidity curves with and without talin , the presence of a rigidity threshold for unfolding , or the regulation of this threshold by the diﬀerent factors . Second , load sharing between talin and other adaptor proteins could reduce the force experienced by individual talin molecules , also increasing the threshold . Indeed , the best fit of our model was obtained by setting the fraction of force on talin to 7 . 3 % ( see Supplementary Table 1 ) , suggesting that talin experiences only a small fraction of the load transmitted by integrins ( of the order of a few piconewtons ) . This is consistent with recently measured tension levels across single talin molecules within cells 18 , and with the observation that talin depletion did not aﬀect force transmission at low rigidities ( Fig . 1 ) . Collectively , those data support the notion that the soft properties of talin 16 are optimized to allow unfolding at low forces , thereby detecting force levels without impairing force transmission ( which may be mediated by other molecules such as α - actinin 27 ) . An open question arising from our work is how vinculin binding to talin leads to adhesion growth and YAP translocation . The mech - anisms involved are likely to include talin - induced integrin cluster - ing 34 – 36 , signalling triggered by vinculin activation on talin binding 37 , vinculin – actin binding to reinforce the mechanical clutch 29 , 38 , and the relay of mechanical forces to the nucleus through stress fibres 39 , 40 . Nevertheless and independently of downstream events , our study clarifies how rigidity regulates force transmission , and how force transmission is in turn converted into a biochemical signal . Given the myriad physiological and pathological processes associated with tissue stiﬀening 41 and YAP signalling 42 , this understanding may also open the door to further fundamental discoveries in biology , and new therapeutic strategies .

To generate gels of diﬀerent stiﬀness , diﬀerent concentrations of acrylamide and bis - acrylamide were mixed ( seeSupplementaryTable2 ) inasolutioncontaining0 . 5 % ammoniumpersul - fate , 0 . 05 % tetramethylethylenediamine ( Sigma ) , 0 . 4 % fluorescent red carboxylated nanobeads ( Invitrogen ) , and 4 . 8mgml − 1 NH - acrylate . Ten microlitres of this solu - tion was then placed on the centre of glass - bottom dishes and covered with 12 - mm - diameterglasscoverslips . Aftergelpolymerization , topcoverslipswereremovedand gels were incubated with fibronectin ( Sigma ) overnight at 4 ◦ C . After washing gels with PBS , cells were then trypsinized and plated on gels . Experiments were carried out 4 – 8h after cell seeding . To compare fibronectin coating densities on the gels , fibronectin used for coating was previously labelled with an Alexa Fluor 488 protein labelling kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( A - 10235 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Then , fibronectin coating densities at the gel surface were measured by acquiring epifluorescence images with a 20 × objective ( NA 0 . 45 ) , and quantifying resulting fluorescence intensity levels . Polyacrylamide gel stiﬀness measurements . The stiﬀness ( Young’s modulus ) of polyacrylamide gels was measured by atomic force microscopy as previously de - scribed 47 . Briefly , measurements were made with a custom - built atomic force mi - croscope attached to an inverted optical microscope ( Nikon TE200 ) . Silicon nitride pyramidal tips with an eﬀective half - angle θ of 20 ◦ and a nominal spring constant of k = 0 . 01 – 0 . 03Nm − 1 were used ( MLCT , Bruker ) . The actual spring constant was calibrated by thermal tuning using the simple harmonic oscillator model 48 . The Young’s modulus was measured by recording 10 force - displacement curves with a peak - to - peak amplitude of 6 µ m and a frequency of 1Hz . Three points near the gel centre were selected in each gel , separated 5 µ m from each other . For each stiﬀness , ≥ 6 gels produced in two batches were measured . To compute the Young’s modulus ( E ) , theHertzmodelequationforpyramidaltipswasfittedtotheforce - displacement curves . The equation was fitted for an eﬀective indentation of 1 , 000nm . Traction force measurements . Traction force measurements were performed as described previously 5 . Briefly , cells seeded on gels were placed on an inverted microscope ( NikonEclipseTi ) . Phasecontrastimagesofsinglecellsandfluorescence imagesoftheembeddednanobeadswereobtainedwitha40 × objective ( NA0 . 6 ) . At the end of the measurements , cells were trypsinized and an image of bead position in the relaxed state of the gel was acquired . By comparing bead positions with and without cells , a map of gel deformations caused by cells was first obtained using custom particle imaging velocimetry software 49 . Then , after assuming that gel displacements were caused by forces exerted by cells in the cell – gel contact area , the correspondingmapofcellforceswascalculatedusingapreviouslydescribedFouriertransformalgorithm 39 , 50 . The average forces per unit area exerted by each cell were then calculated . To calculate the minimum detectable force levels for each rigidity , we followed the same procedure in cell - free gel areas , and calculated the resulting forces . Phasecontrastimageswerealsousedtocalculateaveragecellspreadingareas as a function of substrate stiﬀness . Immunostaining . For fluorescence staining , cells were fixed with 4 % paraformalde - hyde , permeabilizedwith0 . 1 % TritonX - 100 , andlabelledfirstwithprimaryantibod - ies ( 1h , room temperature ) , and then with Alexa - conjugated secondary antibodies ( Invitrogen ; 1h , room temperature ) . Phalloidin was added with the secondary anti - body . Fluorescence images were then acquired with a 60 × oil - immersion objective ( NA 1 . 40 ) using a spinning - disc confocal microscope ( Andor ) . The length of adhe - sions was assessed by measuring the length of bright vinculin , β 3 integrin or pFAK stainingsatthecelledge . Integrindensitywasassessedasdescribedpreviously 5 . The areacontainingpFAK - positiveadhesionswascalculatedaftersegmentingadhesions as previously described 51 . The degree of YAP nuclear localization was assessed by calculating the ratio between YAP fluorescence in the nuclear region and the cytoplasmic region immediately adjacent . Nuclear and cytoplasmic regions were previously determined by co - staining the nucleus with Hoechst 33342 . Rearward flow measurements . To measure actin rearward flow , cells were transfected with Lifeact – GFP . Cells were then plated on gels of varying rigidity , and imaged every second for 2min with a 60 × oil - immersion objective ( NA 1 . 40 ) with a spinning - disc confocal microscope ( Andor ) . For each cell , kymographs were obtained at the cell periphery , and actin speed was measured from the slope of actin features observed in the kymographs . In cells plated on 0 . 6kPa gels , actin features were so diﬀuse that no reliable slopes could be measured in kymographs . Westernblots . Forwesternblottingoftalin , myosinlightchain , andphosphorylated myosin light chain , cells were directly incubated with 1 × Laemli and boiled at 95 ◦ C for 5min . Cell lysates were loaded on 4 – 20 % polyacrylamide gels ( Bio - Rad ) , and electrophoresis proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane ( Whatman , GE Healthcare Life Sciences ) , which was blocked with 5 % dry - milk – Tris buﬀer saline – 0 . 2 % Tween . The membrane was incubated first with primaryantibodies ( overnight , 4 ◦ C ) , andthenwithhorseradish - peroxidase - coupled secondary antibodies ( 1h , room temperature ) . Bands were revealed using the LumiLight kit ( Roche ) and quantified using ImageJ software . Single fibronectin – α v β 3 bond lifetime measurements . The lifetime of single fibronectin – α v β 3 bonds was measured using a previously described biomembrane force probe ( BFP ) technique 52 . Biotinylated red blood cells ( RBCs ) for BFP experimentswerecollectedabidingaGeorgiaInstituteofTechnologyIRB - approved protocol , and prepared as previously described 52 . Target beads were first covalently linked with anti - Penta His ( histidine ) antibody ( catalogue no . 34660 , Qiagen ) , and then further covered with Hexa - His tagged recombinant α v β 3 ectodomain , which was a gift from J . Takagi , Osaka University , Japan 53 . Probe beads were first functionalizedwithstreptavidinthroughcovalentlinkageandthenpartiallycoveredwithbiotinylatedfibronectinmoduleIII , domain 7 – 10 ( FN III7 - 10 , a generous gift from A . Garcia , Georgia Tech , USA ) . To provide maximum integrin activation , experiments were carried out in the presence of 2mM Mn 2 + . In a BFP experiment , the probe bead was glued through biotin – streptavidin interaction onto the apex of the RBC , which was aspirated by a micropipette and acted as a force transducer . A second opposing micropipette grabbed the target bead and drove it to repeatedly impinge the probe bead , contact for 2s and then retract ( ramping ) . Displacement of the probe bead was tracked in real time , which reflected the force exerted on it . If an adhesion event occurred , meaning that one bond or more was formed between the two bead surfaces , ramping resulted in a tensile force signal of the probe bead that pulled on and elongated the RBC . The ramping was then paused at a preset force level ( clamping ) to wait for bond dissociation , manifested by a NATURE CELL BIOLOGY © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved M E T H O D S DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncb3336 backward deformation of the RBC and a sudden force drop to 0pN . To ensure that most adhesion events ( > 90 % ) were single molecular interactions , the frequency of adhesion occurrence was adjusted to be low ( < 20 % ) by titrating the coating densities on both beads 54 . The time that each adhesion survived during clamping is termed the lifetime , which was collected under a range of positive forces . To derive lifetimes under zero force , the ramping was paused at 0pN and held for 20s . Suddendrops / increasesinthethermalfluctuationsignaloftheprobebeadwereused to judge the bond association / dissociation , given that bonding suppresses thermal fluctuation 55 . The average lifetimes were then plotted against the corresponding forcestoforma‘lifetimeversusforce’curve 56 . Toconfirmbindingspecificity , control experiments were performed by either adding a α V β 3 blocking antibody ( clone LM609 , EMD Millipore ) or coating beads only with streptavidin instead of FN III7 - 10 . Both controls yielded rare binding ( ∼ 3 % ) . Statistics and reproducibility . In all figures , measurements are reported as mean ± standard error of the mean ( s . e . m . ) . Statistical comparisons were carried out with two - tailed Student’s t - tests when two cases were compared and with analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) tests when more cases were analysed . The results of all experiments were reproducible ; the number of independent reproductions for each experiment is specified in the figure legends . Computational model and code availability .

The computational model was developed by adapting a Monte Carlo simulation approach previously described in detail 1 . Briefly , the model considers an actin filament being pulled by n m myosin motors , each of them capable of exerting a force of F m . In the absence of adhesion to the substrate , this filament moves at a speed v a , corresponding to the unloaded speed of myosin motors . This filament can use talin-­‐integrin clutches ( modeled as springs with spring constant k c ) to bind to a given number of fibronectin molecules n f . In turn , the fibronectin molecules are all connected in parallel to a spring with spring constant k sub , representing substrate rigidity . At each time step of the simulation , unbound fibronectin molecules are allowed to bind to integrins according to a binding rate k on = k ont ·∙ d int , where k ont is the true binding rate characterizing the interaction , and d int is the density of integrins on the membrane . Similarly , bound integrins are allowed to unbind according to the unbinding rate k off , which depends on applied force as a catch bond . At the end of each time step the actin filament contracts , dragging the bound clutches and exerting force on each clutch , and on the substrate . Total force on the substrate F is calculated by imposing force balance , and actin speed is recalculated . To recalculate this speed , actin speed is assumed to depend linearly on applied force , ranging from v a ( in the absence of force ) to 0 ( when the maximum force of n m ·∙ F m is reached ) . At this point , the cycle of binding and unbinding starts again . This simulation was run for time steps of 5 ms , until a total of 100 s . After the simulation finished , we converted F and k sub to cell traction stresses and substrate Young’s moduli , respectively , by assuming a given adhesion radius r a as described previously 1 , 2 . In addition to the aspects above , in this work we specifically introduced the modelling of talin unfolding and refolding , and vinculin binding . In each time step , for each bound clutch we calculated the unbinding rate k off , and the unfolding rate k unf for the applied force f . k off ( f ) was modeled as a catch bond consisting of the sum of two exponentials , one with positive © 201 6 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

The parameters of the two exponentials were obtained after fitting the curve to experimental data from either the fibronectin-­‐α5β1 bond 3 or the fibronectin-­‐αvβ3 bond ( Fig . 2a , lifetime data in the figure correspond to the inverse of k off ) . In both cases , we took experimental data corresponding to the case of maximum activation ( with Mn 2 + ions ) . Fits shown in figures were obtained by using fibronectin-­‐α5β1 data , but equivalently good fits could be obtained with fibronectin-­‐αvβ3 data after minor modifications of the parameters . To best fit experimental results , the resulting k off ( f ) curve was multiplied by a scaling factor of 0 . 9 , possibly reflecting minor differences in experimental conditions between single molecule measurements and integrins within adhered live cells . Additionally , we further increased the unbinding rates of integrin-­‐Fn bonds at very low forces ( < 1 pN ) with respect to experimental values . Introducing this change only increased the slope at low rigidities , and did not alter any of the other model predictions . The presence of a very high unbinding rate ( low affinity ) at low forces may reflect a low activation state in integrins not submitted to cyclic mechanical stretch 4 . k unf ( f ) was modeled as a simple slip bond ( one exponential with a positive exponent ) by fitting the curve to previously measured data 5 . Because the load on each integrin may be shared between talin and other adaptor molecules , the force used to calculate unfolding was corrected by a factor FR , corresponding to the fraction of integrin-­‐transmitted force experienced by talin . Then , unbinding and unfolding times were determined stochastically according to k off and k unf . If unfolding time was shorter than unbinding time , and fell within the time step window , then talin was allowed to either bind to vinculin ( according to a force-­‐independent binding rate k vin ) or refold ( according to a refolding rate k fold ) . k fold was also modelled as a simple exponential ( with negative exponent ) fitted to measured data 5 . If vinculin binding occurred before refolding , adhesion reinforcement was assumed to occur , and integrin density increased by d add integrins / μm 2 . If integrins unbound before talin unfolding or vinculin binding , integrin density decreased by d add , © 201 6 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved . reflecting the fact that adhesions shrink if force application is decreased 6 , 7 . However , integrin density was not allowed to decrease below the basal d int level . Parameters n f , k ont , n m , d add , and FR were adjusted during simulations to fit the different experimental conditions tested . For those parameters , both 95 % confidence intervals and sensitivities S were calculated . Confidence intervals were calculated by using the nlparci Matlab function taking as an input the experimental data and the Jacobian matrix of the fitted model function . The sensitivity S was calculated following a previously described approach 8 according to the following expression : 𝑆 = 𝑑 log 𝑘 ! ! ! " # ! ! " # 𝑑 log 𝑝 Where p are the different parameters , and k threshold is the threshold substrate spring constant ( rigidity ) that leads to talin unfolding , defined as the point in which integrin density increased by 10 % with respect to baseline values . S values can be interpreted as the fold change in k threshold induced by a fold change in parameter value . To calculate S values , k threshold was calculated for p values around the optimal fitted values . Then , k threshold was plotted against p in a log-­‐log scale , and S was taken as the slope of a linear fit to the plot . References 1 . Elosegui-­‐Artola , A . et al .
