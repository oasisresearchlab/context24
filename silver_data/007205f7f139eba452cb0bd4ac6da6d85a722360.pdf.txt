The endocytosis of SV - 40 into CV - 1 cells was studied using biochemical and ultrastructural tech - niques . The half - time of binding of 35Smethionine - radiolabeled SV - 40 to CV - 1 cells was 25 min . Most of the incoming virus particles remained undegraded for several hours . Electron microscopy showed that some virus entered the endosomal / lysosomal pathway via coated vesicles , while the majority were endocytosed via small uncoated vesicles . After infection at high multiplicity , one third of total cell - associated virus was observed to enter the ER , starting 1 - 2 h after virus application . The viruses were present in large , tubular , smooth membrane networks generated as extentions of the ER . The results describe a novel and unique mem - brane transport pathway that allows endocytosed viral particles to be targeted from the plasma membrane to the ER . M ANY animal viruses exploit the endocytic and se - cretory pathways of their host cells for entry and exit . Receptor - mediated endocytosis via coated vesicles is often required for virus penetration ( 14 , 20 , 21 ) . Subsequently , the secretory pathway is used by many envel - oped viruses for posttranslational modification and transport of virions and structural proteins to the cell surface ( 10 ) . As a rule , viruses and viral components follow common estab - lished pathways of constitutive cellular membrane traffic . Morphological studies of SV - 40 and polyoma virus entry have suggested , however , that all viruses may not be as dis - ciplined in their interactions with cellular organelles . These nonenveloped viruses , which belong to the papovavirus fam - ily , have been seen to enter the cells via small tight - fitting , uncoated membrane vesicles ( " monopinocytotic " vesicles ) derived from the plasma membrane ( 13 , 15 , 19 , 23 , 24 ) . In - coming virus particles have also been reported in a variety of cellular compartments , including the nucleoplasm , the lysosomes , the ER , and mitochondria ( 15 , 19 , 23 , 24 ) . SV - 40 particles have also been found in the cytoplasm , where they sometimes appear between ER cistemae ( 24 ) . The apparent presence of viruses within a compartment associated with the ER ( 24 ) is particularly interesting be - cause it suggests a novel endocytotic pathway targeted from the plasma membrane to the ER . Endocytic markers are generally not observed in the ER ; they enter the endosomes and lysosomes , and some markers enter the trans compart - ment within the Golgi complex . Alternatively , as recently suggested by Clayson et al . ( 7 ) , the ER - associated virus could represent newly assembled particles in transit from the nu - cleus ( where assembly of SV - 40 occurs ) to the extracellular space . In this paper we have reinvestigated the uptake of SV - 40 into CV - 1 cells and established ( a ) that incoming particles are , indeed , targeted to the ER ; ( b ) that they there induce the formation of specialized tubular membrane structures ; and ( c ) that initial uptake occurs mainly by adsorptive endocyto - sis independent of coated vesicles . Materials and Methods Cells and Viruses African green monkey kidney cells ( CV - I cells ) were grown in DME with 10 % FCS . Cells were subcultured and split to a ratio of 1 : 10 and used be - tween passages 3 and 25 . They were passnged twice weekly and experiments were done on the second or third day after plating . For stock virus production , subconfluent cells were infected with a mul - tiplicity of 0 . 01 plaque - forming units ( PFU ) . i For radioactive virus 10 PFU was used . Cells were grown in cell culture flasks ( 75 cm2 ; Falcon Labware , Oxnard , California ) . After 10 - 11 and 3 - - 4 d , respectively , infected cells and superuatants were collected and frozen in 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 2 , and stored at - 70°C . To grow SV - 40 incorporating isotopically labeled DNA , the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 20 t ~ Ci of 13Hthy - midine / ml ( specific activity 70 - 85 Ci / mmole ; Radiocbemical Centre , Amer - sham , England ) 15 - 18 h after infection . For production of virus incorporat - ing isotopieally labeled proteins , the medium was removed 2 h al ~ r infection and replaced with medium containing 25 % less of the normal methionine concentration . 25 - 30 h later , 50 # Ci of 35Smethionine ( specific activity 1 , 000 Ci / mmole ; Radiocbemical Centre ) was added to the medium . Virus pools used in this study contained an average of 2 . 5 x lO s PFU / ml . The PFU were determined by plaque assay ( 11 ) . Virus Purification Infected cells and supernatants were frozen and thawed three times and fur - ther disrupted by sonication ( two bursts for 3 - - 4 s each burst ) . After centrifu - gation at 10 , 000 g for 40 min , the pellet was resuspended in 10 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , sonicated as above , and centrifuged at 10 , 000 g for 30 rain . Both supernatants were combined and centrifuged at 140 , 000 g for 3 . 5 h . The pel - let was resuspended in DME using a small homogenizer ( Potter ; Chemic 1 .

The banded virus ( den - sity , ~ 1 . 38 g / cm ~ ) was collected , dialyzed against 10 mM Tris - HCI , pH 7 . 4 , frozen in liquid nitrogen , and stored at - 70°C . The 3Hlthymidine - and 35Smethionine - labeled virus contained ' ~ 5 x 103 and 9 x 104 , re - spectively , counts per 10 pl . Association of l ~ SMethionine - labeled SV - 40 Particles to CV - 1 Cells Confluent cells on 6 - cm Petri dishes were washed twice with R medium ( RPMI 1640 containing 10 mM Hepes , 0 . 1 % BSA , pH 6 . 8 ) . The medium was removed , and I mi of 35Smethionine - labeled SV - 40 in R medium was added to each dish . The cells were incubated for various periods of time at 37°C ; during this lime the dishes were rocked slowly . For later time points than 120 rain , the R medium was removed , the cells were washed twice with R medium , and 5 mi of fresh DME was added . To determine total cell - associated radioactivity , the medium was removed , and the cells were washed twice , scraped into 1 ml PBS containing I mM PMFS , precipitated with " IrA ( for 1 h at 0°C at a final concentration of 10 % ) , and centrifuged ( for 15 min at 5 , 000 rpm at 4°C ) . The dishes were subsequently washed twice with 1 ml 10 % TCA . The collected precipitates were assayed for ra - dioactivity . Treatment of cell surface - associatad virus was performed using proteinase K as described ( 14 ) . Aliquots of the combined medium and washes were precipitated with TCA for determination of degraded viral pro - teins ( as above ) . Gel Electrophoresis Cells were scrap ~ offth¢ dish with PBS ( containing 2 % FCS , I mM PMFS , Aprotinin ) , centrifuged , and dissolved in Laemmli sample buffer ( 17 ) . Gels ( 10 % ) were prepared according to Laemmli ( 17 ) . Fluorography was per - formed essentially by the method of Chamberlain ( 5 ) using 1 M sodium salicylate , pH 7 , in 30 % methanol . Electron Microscopy For morphological studies , confluent cells were either grown on coverslips or in 12 - well Linbm plates ( Flow Laboratories , Hamden , CT ) . Before infec - tion with SV - 40 , the cells were washed twice with R medium . Infection with unlabeled and 3HJthymidine - labeled virus was performed at a multiplicity of 0 . 5 - 5 × 103 PFU / cell at 370C . R medium was used for time points up to 60 rain . For later time points , R medium was replaced by DME . Endocy - tosis 0f soluble type VI honmradish pemxidase ( HRP ; Sigma Chemical Co , , St . Louis , MO ) was performed as described O1 ) . For experiments with cy - eloheximide ( 2 - 20 pg / ml ; Sigma Chemical Co . ) , the inhibitor was either applied with the virus or 2 h after infection and left in the culture medium until the end of the experiment . At different time points after infection , cells were fixed for electron microscopy in 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde ( 0 . 05 M sodium cacodylate , pH 7 . 2 , 50 mM KCI , 1 . 25 mM MgCI2 , 1 . 25 mM CaCI2 ) for 20 rain at room tetrqmrature followed by 1 h in 2 % OsO4 . Dehydration , embedding , thin sectioning , staining , and autoradiography were performed as described ( 16 , 28 ) . Electron micrographs were taken with a JEOL USA 100 electron microscope ( Peabody , MA ) and a Philips Electronic Instru - ments , Inc . , 400 electron microscope ( Mahwah , NJ ) . For quantitative analy - sis , either micrographs were taken at a primary magnification of 10D00x or the cells were observed under the electron microscope at a magnification of 25 , 000× . Statistical evaluation was done on sections of 250 complete cells of duplicate experiments . Electron Microscopic Immunolocalization For immunolocalizntion , cells were fixed for 20 min in 3 % freshly prepared formaldehyde in PBS , pH 7 . 2 , followed by a brief treatment with 0 . 5 % sapo - nin in PBS for 3 min . A murine monoclonai antibody ( 4 ) specifically recog - nizing a component of the ER ( binding protein BiP , also called GRP 78 ; see reference 4 ; generously provided by Dr . D . Bole , Yale University Medi - cal School , New Haven , CT ) was applied for 3 h . The reactive sites were visualized by application of a secondary goat anti - mouse antibody coupled to HRP ( Biomeda , Hamburg , FRG ) for 40 min . Reaction with diaminoben - zidine was performed as described ( 12 , 16 ) . Results The kinetics of SV - 40 binding to CV - I cells was determined using isolated 3sSmethionine - labeled virus . As shown in Fig . 1 a the half - time of association at 37°C was ' ~ 25 min , which is comparable with other animal viruses under similar conditions ( 22 ) . The association was virtually irreversible : the viruses could not be removed by repeated washing and only 10 % could be removed at any time by proteinase K digestion . Degradation of cell - associated viral proteins was remarkably slow compared with viruses that enter the en - dosomal / lysosomal pathway ( 22 ) . Only 5 % was degraded during the first 2 h as judged by the small amount of TCA - soluble radioactivity generated ( Fig . 1 a ) . After 22 h , 65 % of the structural proteins VPl and VP3 remained intact ( Fig . 1 , 17 and c ) . This suggested that the majority of SV - 40 parti - cles either remained extracellular for extended periods of time or that the virus entered the cell but escaped degra - dation . To further trace the fate of the virus particle , electron mi - croscopy was used . SV - 40 was added to CV - I cells at high multiplicity , and the cultures were fixed for electron micros - copy after incubation at different times at 37°C . After short incubations ( 5 - 10 rain ) , the virus particles were seen at - tached to the cell surface . As previously described ( 13 , 15 , 19 , 24 ) , many viruses were in small invaginations and at the plasma membrane , and some were in tight - fitting monopino - cytotic vesicles ( Fig . 2 , a - c ; reference 13 ) . These vesicles had a diameter of 60 nm , and there was no visible coat mate - rial on their cytoplasmic surface . Occasional virus particles could also be seen in typical coated pits and coated vesicles ( Fig . 2 d ) . After 15 - 30 rain of incubation , viruses were in - creasingly observed within tubular membrane - bounded struc - tures ( Fig . 2 e ) that often contained multiple viral particles . Some viruses were also present in endosomes ( Fig . 2 , g and h ) . We observed no difference in the uptake of complete vi - ruses and empty capsids present in some of our virus prepa - rations . The latter can be easily distinguished by the lack of an electron - dense central core ( see Fig . 2 , e and j ) . After I - 2 h , virus particles and empty capsids began to ap - pear in the lumen of the ER . Initially they were mostly pres - ent as single isolated particles , but over the next few hours irregular , ER - associated , tubular membrane networks ap - peared containing a large number of particles ( Fig . 2 , f , i , and j ) . The viruses typically occupied positions in the ver - tices of the complex tubular structure . In many instances , the virions defined the point of convergence of three to six sepa - rate tubular membrane elements radiating in different direc - tions . The membranes of these structures were devoid of ribosomes ( 24 ) , but they were in direct continuity with the PER . The ER aggregates were found with a frequency of 0 . 7 aggregates per cell section . This number remained un - changed after 4 - 22 h of incubation , but the number of virus particles and the size of the aggregates increased with time . Some reached a size of 1 - 2 ~ tm in diameter as shown in Fig . 3 b . Several large virus - containing clusters could be seen in a single cell ( Fig . 3 a ) . In rare cases , virus particles were also seen in the space between the outer and inner nuclear membranes ( Fig . 2 k ; see also 24 ) . In contrast to previous reports ( 24 ) , we did not detect delivery of viruses into mitochondria , the nucleoplasm , or the cytoplasm ; viruses were also not apparent in the Golgi stacks . While common in endosomes , virus particles were rarely seen in typical secondary lysosomes . To confirm that the virus - containing tubular membrane networks were part of the ER , immunocytochemistry was The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 109 , 1989 2722 Figure L SV - 40 interaction with CV - 1 cells at 37°C . ( a ) Total cell association of 35S - SV - 40 is indicated by solid circles . Degraded vi - ral proteins , indicated by open squares , were detected by determina - tion of acid - soluble radioactivity in the binding medium . Cells ( 7 x 106 on 6 - cm dishes ) were incubated with 24 , 000 clam 35S - SV - 40 ( 6 . 4 x 10 s PFU ) . ( b ) Kinetics of asS - SV - 40 degradation between 2 and 22 h after infection . After binding of the virus in R medium for 2 h , unbound virus was washed away and R medium was replaced with cold culture medium . Degraded viral proteins ( acid - soluble radioactivity in the medium ) were determined at the indi - cated time points . Cells ( 7 x 106 on 6 - cm dishes ) were incubated with 60 , 000 clam 35S - SV - 40 ( 9 x l0 s PFU ) . ( c ) 35S - SV - 40 was ap - performed using antibodies to a binding protein ( BiP , also called GRP 78 ) . This heat shock - related soluble protein is located within the ER ( 4 ) . The immunoperoxidase technique showed that the virus - containing ER structures contained BiP ( Fig . 4 ) . Although the resolution was not optimal ( a frequent problem with this technique in CV - 1 cells ) , it was clear that BiP was ER specific ; no staining of Golgi cisternae , mito - chondria , and endocytic organdies was detected . To obtain a quantitative estimate of the virus distribution in the cell , morphological quantitation was performed on random sections . The number of viruses was determined in five compartments : the plasmamembrane ; the monopinocy - totic vesicles ; the tubular structures ; the endosomes , lyso - somes , multivesicular bodies , and larger vacuoles ; and the ER . The results shown in Fig . 5 revealed that at intermediate times many viruses were seen in monopinocytotic vesicles , tubular structures , and endosomes . After 4 h , intracellular viruses were mainly in the tubular structures , and , at 19 h ( and beyond ) , the majority of the virus particles ( 55 % ) had moved from the surface to the ER - associated structures . Thus , transport to the ER occurred rather slowly . Three methods were used to confirm that the ER - associated viruses were endocytically derived and not newly synthesized progeny viruses . First , 3H - labeled viruses were allowed to enter and the cells were analyzed by electron microscopic autoradiography . The label was observed over all the virus - containing ER aggregates ( Fig . 6 ) and over some endosomes ( not shown ) . A few grains were also seen over the nucleus and over cytoplasmic areas devoid of identifiable virions . As shown in Fig . 6 b , the progeny viruses in the nucleus were not labeled . Mitochondria and the Golgi complexes were similarly devoid of radioactive label ( e . g . , Fig . 6 a ) . Second , viruses were allowed to enter cells in the presence of cyclo - heximide . Despite the block in protein synthesis , virus parti - cles appeared in the ER lumen and in ER aggregates . Third , cells were infected at low ( less than one ) multiplicity of in - fection and allowed to synthesize viruses for 48 - 60 h . Under these conditions , no ER aggregates were observed . We con - clude from these experiments that the viruses in the ER con - stitute endocytosed particles and that formation of the tubu - lar ER structures is independent of protein synthesis . This conclusion is in agreement with the observation that ER par - ticles appear well before the onset of progeny virus produc - tion . In addition , it is apparent that newly synthesized vi - ruses abundantly present in the nucleus cannot enter the ER cisternae . As already mentioned , markers of fluid or adsorbtive en - docytosis do not normally reach the ER ( 31 , 32 ) . To test whether a fluid phase marker could enter together with the incoming virus particles , virus uptake was allowed to occur in the presence of 1 mg / ml HRP . We found that , while virus entered normally , no HRP staining could be detected in the ER compartment . Endosomes and lysosomes were , how - ever , as strongly stained as in control cells ( Fig . 7 ) . These plied to CV - 1 cells for 2 h at 37°C . Unbound virus was washed away , and cells were collected at various time points after infection and resolved on a 10 % Laemmli gel . ( Lanes 1 - 4 ) 2 , 6 , 23 , and 46 h after infection , respectively . Note the presence of the intact viral core proteins VP1 and VP3 even at late time points of infection .

Bars , 0 . 5 ~ tm . results suggested that SV - 40 is internalized into the ER by mechanisms that exclude the fluid phase . Discussion It is clear from the results in this paper and from several previous studies 05 , 23 , 24 ) that SV - 40 particles and other papovaviruses enter the host cell by endocytosis . This occurs in part via the constitutive receptor - mediated pathway in - volving coated vesicles , endosomes , and lysosomes or a pathway commonly used by other viruses for cell entry and infec ~ on ( 22 ) . A large fraction of ~ SV - 40 pmicles , however , follow a less conventional endocytic pathway that begins with the inclusion into tight - fitting plasma membrane - derived vesi - cles 05 , 23 , 24 ) . Morphological and biochemical studies of these monopinocytotic vesicles 03 ) have suggested that they may be formed as a consequence of tight binding of the virus to multiple , yet unidentified , plasma membrane receptors . Our results suggest that the fit between the virus and the vesi - cle membrane is apparently so tight that there is little space for fluid markers . This is in marked contrast to coated vesi - cle - dependent endocytosis of Semiiki Forest virus , which is accompanied by detectable amounts of fluid uptake ( 21 ) . Figure 5 .

An ER cisteruae demonstrating a membrane continuity with an aggregate is shown at higher magnification in c . The most striking aspect of the SV - 40 uptake is the target - ing to the ER since the ER is not generally considered an ac - ceptor organeUe for endocytotic membrane traffic . A variety of tracers such as HRP , cationized ferritin , and gold - labeled ligands are routinely seen to enter endosomes , lysosomes , multivesicular bodies , and other elements of the vacuolar ap - paratus ( 31 , 32 ) . Internalized compounds , though less fre - quently , also enter Golgi elements ( 2 , 34 , 35 ) . Such com - monly used markers as well as receptor - bound ligands of endocytosis are , however , conspicuously absent from the ER , nuclear membrane , and mitochondria . The observation that SV - 40 is delivered to the ER is , therefore , unique . Whether the transport reflects an ongoing process that the vi - rus exploits or an individual pathway specific for the virus Kartenbeck et al . Endocytosis of SV - 40 into the ER 2727 Figure 7 . Electron micrographs of CV - 1 cells infected with SV - 40 and exposed to HRP . Cells infected for 90 min with SV - 40 followed by a pulse of HRP for 20 min ( a ) show reaction products in coated vesicles ( CV ) , endosomes ( E ) , and some tubular structures ( insert ) . In b , cells 6 h after infection with SV - 40 were exposed for an additional 16 h to HRP . Reaction products are found in various membrane compartments of the endocytotic pathway , as shown here in endosomes ( E ) but not in cisternae of the ER or in the extended tubular networks that form membrane continuities with the ER . Arrows point to internalized virus particles that are partly obscured by the electron - dense reaction product . Bars , 0 . 2 # m . is not known . However , the pinocytotic vesicles involved must contain components that allow their targeting to the ER . Additional studies may allow the identification of such fac - tors . Also , viruses may provide a mechanism for transport - ing membrane - impermeable reagents to the ER : such com - pounds could include pH probes , inhibitors , peptides , and proteins . The notion that the ER can serve as an acceptor compart - ment for membrane transport , and not only as a donor , has been recently discussed in the context of lipid recycling and the replacement of membrane lost from the ER during secre - tion ( 26 ) . The recent papers of Lippincott - Schwartz et al . ( 18 ) and Doms et al . ( 9 ) suggest that a membrane recycling can indeed occur between cis - and medial - Golgi cisternae and the ER . Whether transport to the ER can occur from more distal organdies such as the plasma membrane is not clear . It is known that certain lipids such as cholesterol and desmosterol , when applied extracellularly , do reach the ER where they become metabolically modified ( 30 ) . The ER - associated virus particles were present in elabo - rated interconnected , tubular smooth membrane structures . Such specializations of the ER , though structurally some - what different , have previously been described in cells chronically starved of cholesterol as well as in cells treated with inhibitors such as 3 - hydroxy - 3 - methylglutarylcoenzyme A reductase ( 6 , 25 , 29 ) . They have also been observed in type II cells of the taste buds ( 33 ) and in some cell types infected with other viruses ( 27 ) . Thus , the ER is an organelle that can accommodate large amounts of newly synthesized membrane proteins such as the coenzyme A reductase but also massive mounts of endocytosed virions . It may be significant that the virus - containing structures contain the heat shock protein BiP , which has been implicated as a cofactor during protein oligomerization and the retention of misfolded proteins within the ER lumen ( 4 ) . In agreement with immunolocalization data by Bole , D . , and J . D . Jamieson ( Yale University Medical School , New Haven , CT ; personal communication ) , BiP was exclusively observed within the ER system of CV - 1 cells , thereby confirming that the virions were within the ER . Our results indicate that the ER contains incoming endocy - tosed particles and not progeny virus derived from the cell ' s nucleus . It is therefore unlikely that the ER structures serve in the transit of newly synthesized SV - 40 from the nucleus to the plasma membrane , as recently suggested by Clayson et al . ( 7 ) for polarized epithelial cells . However , it is also un - clear whether the transport of viruses to the ER is in any way connected with productive infection of the cell . To infect a host cell , SV - 40 has to deliver its genome to the nucleus , which is the site of papovavirus replication , transcription , and virion assembly . Only a small fraction of papovavirus particles are capable of initiating infection ( 1 , 3 , 8 ) , and preliminary results indicate that only 5 - 10 % of viral DNA is delivered to the nucleus . Additional studies must ad - dress the possible mechanisms by which the viral genome could be translocated from the ER to nuclear compartment . We thank Dr .
