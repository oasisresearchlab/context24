Here , we investigate how the mechanisms by which creative teams self - assemble determine the structure of these collabo - ration networks . We propose a model for the self - assembly of creative teams that is based on three parameters : team size , the fraction of newcomers in new productions and the tendency of incumbents to repeat previous collaborations . The model suggests that the emergence of a large connected community of practitioners can be described as a phase transition . We ﬁnd that team assem - bly mechanisms determine both the structure of the collaboration network and team performance , for teams derived from both artistic and scientiﬁc ﬁelds . Teams are assembled because of the need to incorporate individuals with different ideas , skills , and resources . Creativity is spurred when proved innovations in one domain are intro - 1 duced into a new domain , solving old problems and inspiring fresh thinking ( 1 – 4 ) . However , research shows that the right balance of diversity on a team is elusive . While diversity may potentially spur creativity , it typically promotes conﬂict and miscommunication ( 5 – 7 ) . It also runs counter to the security most individuals experience in working and sharing ideas with past collaborators ( 8 ) . Successful teams evolve toward a size that is large enough to enable spe - cialization and effective division of labor among teammates , but small enough to avoid over - whelming costs of group coordination ( 9 ) . Here , we investigate empirically and theoretically the mechanisms by which teams of creative agents are assembled . We also investigate how these microscopic team assembly mechanisms determine both the macro structure of a creative ﬁeld , and the success of certain teams in using the resources and knowledge available in the ﬁeld . We develop a model for the assembly of teams of creative agents . In our model , the selection of the members of a team is controlled by three parameters : the number m of team members , the probability p of selecting incumbents , that is , agents already belonging to the network , and the propensity q of incumbents to repeat past collaborations . The model predicts the existence of two phases which are determined mainly by the values of p and q . In one phase there is a large cluster connecting a signiﬁcant fraction of the agents , while in the other phase the agents form a large number of isolated clusters . We analyzed data from both artistic and scientiﬁc ﬁelds where collaboration needs have experienced pressures such as differentiation and specialization , internationalization , and com - mercialization ( 4 , 10 , 11 ) : ( i ) the Broadway musical industry ( BMI ) , and ( ii ) the scientiﬁc dis - ciplines of social psychology , ecology , and astronomy ( Table 1 ) . For the BMI , we considered all number productions in the period 1877 – 1990 ( 12 , 13 ) . For each of the scientiﬁc disciplines , we considered all collaborations that resulted in publications in recognized journals within the ﬁelds studied ( 14 ) —seven social psychology journals , ten ecology journals , and six astronomy journals ( Table 2 ) . Collaboration networks ( 15 – 19 ) were then built for each of the journals inde - 2 pendently , and for the whole discipline by merging the data from the journals within a discipline ( see Supporting Material ) . The evolution of team sizes in the BMI bears out the expectation that team size and compo - sition depend on the intricacy of the creative task . In the period 1877 – 1929 , when the form of the Broadway musical show was still being worked out through trial and error ( 12 ) , there was a steady increase in the number of artists per production , from an average of two to an average of seven ( Fig . 1A ) . This increase in size suggests that teams evolved to manage the complexity of the new artistic form . By the late 20’s , the Broadway musical reached the form we know today ( 4 ) . For the following 55 years , a period that includes the Great Depression , World War II , and the post - War Boom , the average size of teams remained around seven ( 20 ) . We ﬁnd similar scenarios for the evolution of team size in scientiﬁc collaborations . The three ﬁelds showed an increase in team size with time ( Figs . 1B - D ) . The increase was approx - imately linear in social psychology and faster than linear in ecology and astronomy . For social psychology , team size growth rate was greater for high impact versus low impact journals , sug - gesting that team size not only depends on the intricacy of the enterprise but also that successful teams might adapt faster to external pressures . The analysis of team size cannot capture the fact that teams are embedded in a larger network ( 3 ) . This complex network ( 21 – 23 ) , which is the result of past collaborations and the medium in which future collaborations will develop , acts as a storehouse for the pool of “knowledge” created within the ﬁeld . The way the members of a team are embedded in the larger network affects the manner in which they access the knowledge in the ﬁeld . Therefore , teams formed by individuals with large but disparate sets of collaborators are more likely to draw from a more diverse reservoir of knowledge . At the same time , and for the same reasons , the way teams are organized into a larger network affects how likely it is that breakthroughs will occur in a given ﬁeld . 3 The agents comprising a team may be classiﬁed according to their experience . Some agents are newcomers , that is , rookies , with little experience and unseasoned skills . Other agents are incumbents . They are established persons with a track record , a reputation , and identiﬁable tal - ents . The differentiation of agents into newcomers and incumbents results in four possible types of links within a team : ( 1 ) newcomer – newcomer ; ( 2 ) newcomer – incumbent ; ( 3 ) incumbent – incumbent ; and ( 4 ) repeat incumbent – incumbent . The distribution of different types of links reﬂects the team’s underlying diversity . For example , if teams have a preponderance of repeat incumbent – incumbent links , it is less likely that they will have innovative ideas because their shared experiences tend to homogenize their pool of knowledge . In contrast , teams with a vari - ety of types of links are likely to have more diverse perspectives to draw from , and therefore to contribute more innovative solutions . Since quantifying the emergence and effects of team diversity ( 2 , 9 , 24 – 26 ) is more difﬁcult than measuring team size , we consider next a model for the assembly of teams . In our model , we assemble N teams in temporal sequence . The assembly of each team is controlled by three parameters : m , p , and q . The ﬁrst parameter , m , is the number of agents in a team . In our investigations of the model we considered three situations : keep m constant , draw m from a distribution , or use a sequence of m values obtained from the data . For the theoretical analysis of the model we keep m constant , while comparison with an empirical dataset is done using the sequence of m ( t ) values in the corresponding dataset . The second parameter , p , is the average fraction of incumbents that participate in a team . Higher values of p indicate fewer opportunities for newcomers to enter a ﬁeld . The third param - eter , q , represents the inclination for incumbents to collaborate with prior collaborators , rather than initiate a new collaboration with an incumbent they have not worked with in the past . We start at time zero with an endless pool of newcomers . Newcomers become incumbents the ﬁrst time step after being selected for a team . Each time step t , we assemble a new team and 4 add it to the network ( Fig . 2 ) . We select sequentially m ( t ) different agents . Each agent in a team has a probability p of being drawn from the pool of incumbents and a probability 1 − p of being drawn from the pool of newcomers . If the agent is drawn from the incumbents’ pool and there is already another incumbent in the team , then : ( i ) with probability q , the new agent is randomly selected from among the set of collaborators of a randomly selected incumbent already in the team ; ( ii ) otherwise she is selected at random among all incumbents in the network . Finally , nodes that remain inactive for longer than τ time steps are removed from the net - work . This rule is motivated by the observation that agents do not remain in the network forever—agents age and retire , change careers , and so on . The removal process enables the network to reach a steady state after a transient time . Our results do not depend in the speciﬁc value of τ ( see Supporting Material ) . Through participation in a team , agents become part of a large network ( 27 ) . We were interested in examining the topology of the network of collaborations among the practitioners of a given ﬁeld . More speciﬁcally , we asked “Is there a large connected cluster comprising most of the agents or is the network comprised of numerous smaller clusters ? ” A large connected cluster would be supporting evidence for the so - called “invisible college , ” the web of social and professional contacts linking scientists across universities proposed by de Solla Price ( 28 ) and Merton ( 29 ) . A large number of small clusters would be indicative of a ﬁeld made up of isolated “schools of thought . ” For all four ﬁelds considered here , we ﬁnd that the network contains a large connected cluster . As is typically done in the study of percolation phase transitions ( 30 ) , we use the fraction S of nodes that belong to the largest cluster of the network to quantify the transition between these two regimes : invisible college or isolated schools . We explore systematically the ( p , q ) parameter - space of the model . We ﬁnd that the network goes through a percolation transition at a critical line p c ( m , q ) . That is , the system experiences a sharp transition from a multitude 5 of small clusters to a situation in which one large cluster , comprising a large fraction S of the individuals , emerges—the so - called giant component ( Fig . 3 ) . The transition line p c ( m , q ) therefore determines the tipping point for the emergence of the invisible college ( 31 ) . Our analysis shows that the existence or not of this transition is independent of the average number of agents (cid:104) m (cid:105) in a collaboration , although the precise value of p c ( m , q ) does depend on m . The proximity to the transition line—which depends on the distribution of the different types of links—determines the structure of the largest cluster ( Fig . 3A ) . In the vicinity of the transition , the largest cluster has an almost linear or branched structure ( Fig . 3A , p = 0 . 30 ) . As one moves toward larger p , the largest cluster starts to have more and more loops ( Fig . 3A , p = 0 . 35 ) and , eventually , it becomes a densely connected network ( Fig . 3A , p = 0 . 60 ) . Networks with the same fraction S of nodes in the largest cluster do not necessarily corre - spond to networks with identical properties . Each point in the ( p , q ) parameter - space is char - acterized by both S and the fraction f R of repeat incumbent - incumbent links . For example , in Fig . 3C , the line f R = 0 . 32 corresponds to those values of p and q for which 32 % of all links in new teams are between repeat collaborators ( 32 ) . The fraction of repeat incumbent - incumbent links has a signiﬁcant impact on the dynamics of the network . When f R is large , collabora - tions are ﬁrmly established and therefore the structure of the network changes very slowly . In contrast , low values of f R correspond to enterprises with high turnover and very fast dynamics . Intermediate values of f R are related to situations in which collaboration patterns with peers are “ﬂuid” ( see Supporting Material ) . For each of the four ﬁelds for which we have empirical data , we measure the relative size of the giant component S ( see Supporting Material ) . For all ﬁelds considered S is larger than 50 % ( Table 1 ) . This result provides quantitative evidence for the existence of an “invisible college” in all the ﬁelds . Intriguingly , the relative sizes of the giant component is similar for three of the four ﬁelds considered : BMI , social psychology , and ecology , S = 0 . 70 , S = 0 . 68 , and S = 0 . 75 6 respectively . However , for astronomy S was signiﬁcantly larger ( 0 . 92 ) . To gain further insight in the structure of collaboration networks , we use our model to es - timate the values of p and q for each ﬁeld . Given the temporal sequence of teams giving rise to the network of collaborations , one can calculate the fraction of incumbents and the fraction of repeat incumbent - incumbent links . These fractions and the model enable us to then estimate the values of p and q that are consistent with the data ( 33 ) . We estimate p and q for each ﬁeld , and then simulate the model to predict the key prop - erties of the network of collaborations , including the degree distribution of the network and the fraction S of nodes in the largest cluster . By comparing predictions of the model with the empirical results , we are able to validate the model . We ﬁrst compare the degree distribution of the collaboration networks with the predictions of the model ( Fig . 4A - D ) , and ﬁnd that the model predicts the empirical degree distributions remarkably well . In Table 1 , we compare the predictions of the model for S with the measured values . The model correctly predicts that an “invisible college” containing more than 50 % of the nodes exists in all cases . Even more signiﬁcantly , the values of S predicted by the model are in good agreement with the empirical results . To investigate how changes of the team assembly mechanism affect the structure of the network , we use the model to generate networks with the same sequence of team sizes as the data , but with different values of p and q . We show in Figs . 4E - H that , notably , at least three out of the four creative networks we consider are very close to the “tipping” line at which an invisible college emerges . The exception is , again , astronomy . We also ﬁnd that , for astronomy , the fraction of repeat incumbent - incumbent links is signiﬁcantly larger than for the other ﬁelds . If diversity affects team performance and our model correctly captures how diversity is related to the way teams are assembled , then the parameters p and q must be related to team performance . To investigate this issue , we consider , for the three scientiﬁc ﬁelds , how teams 7 publishing in different journals are assembled . We used each journal’s impact factor as a proxy for the quality of teams’ output . We then studied the different journals separately to quantify the relationship between team assembly mechanisms and performance . In Fig . 5 , we show the values of p , q , and S for the journals in each of the ﬁelds as a function of the impact of the journal . We found that p was positively correlated with impact factor , whereas q was negatively correlated with impact factor , for both ecology and social psychology . The result for p implies that successful teams have a higher fraction of incumbents , who contribute expertise and know - how to the team , while the result for q implies that teams that are less diverse typically have lower levels of performance . The relative size S of the giant component in a journal was also associated with perfor - mance for ecology and social psychology . Teams publishing in journals with a high impact factor typically give rise to a large giant component , while teams publishing in low - impact journals typically form small isolated clusters . This suggests that teams publishing in high im - pact journals perform a better sampling of the knowledge within a ﬁeld , and thus are able to more efﬁciently use the resources of the “invisible college . ” Surprisingly , neither p , q , or S were signiﬁcantly correlated with impact factor in astronomy . This distinguishes astronomy from the other creative enterprises considered . We have shown that team size evolves with time , probably up to an optimal size , as in the case of the BMI . A similar process may be occurring for the parameters quantifying expertise , p , and diversity , q . Three of the four ﬁelds considered—all except astronomy—had very similar values of p , q , and S , thus suggesting that a “universal” set of optimal values might exist . The fact that in astronomy there are no correlations between p , q , or S and the impact of journals , also indicates that this ﬁeld is different from the others . Whether these differences are due to the needs imposed by the creative enterprise itself or to historical or other reasons is a question that we cannot answer conclusively . 8 Our ﬁndings also suggest an explanation for the high impact of research published in top interdisciplinary journals such as Science , Nature , PNAS , Physical Review Letters , or Bioinfor - matics . The teams publishing in these journals comprise scientists drawn from across different ﬁelds . Hence , these teams draw on the largest pools of creative material—pools that exist not just within a single scientiﬁc discipline , but across different disciplines . 9 References and Notes 1 . M .

We impose several requirements on the journals we selected for analysis . First , the main subject category of the journal must be the desired one . For example , we consider only those ecology journals whose subject category is either ”Ecology” or ”Ecology” and ”Bio - diversity and conservation” , according to the ISI Journal Citation Reports . We disregard more specialized journals , such as Microbial Biology , whose subject category is more spe - ciﬁc . We also require that journals contain a sufﬁciently large number of papers , typically at least 1500 . 15 . M . E . J . Newman , Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 98 , 404 ( 2001 ) . 16 . A . - L .

Technically , agents are con - nected only to teams and vice - versa . However , this bipartite network can be projected onto a network comprising only agents and in which there is an edge ( connection ) between two nodes ( agents ) if the agents have been connected to at least one common team . 28 .

Figure 3C shows that large f R occurs when p and q are large , and corresponds to a net - work in which collaborations among incumbents are ﬁrmly established and opportunities for newcomers are few . Conversely , small f R , which occurs when p and / or q are small , indicates plentiful opportunities for newcomers to join new projects . In this case , newcom - ers are the norm and collaborations are rarely repeated . Finally , intermediate values of f R suggest intermediate values of both p and q , that is , a situation for which there is a balance between seasoned incumbents and newcomers with fresh ideas . 33 . The value of p is directly given by the fraction of incumbents in new creations , while the value of q must be obtained numerically by simulating the model . 12 34 . We thank A . A . Moreira , V .

Figure 2 : Modeling the emergence of collaboration networks in creative enterprises . ( A ) Cre - ation of a team with m = 3 agents . Consider , at time zero , a collaboration network comprising ﬁve agents , all incumbents ( blue circles ) . Along with the incumbents , there is a large pool of newcomers ( green circles ) available to participate in new teams . The rules to create the team involve two steps . In step one , one selects an agent for the new team . With probability p this agent is a randomly selected incumbent , while with probability 1 − p it is a randomly selected newcomer . For concreteness , let us assume that incumbent “4” is selected as the ﬁrst agent in the new team . One then repeats step one to determine if the second agent in the team is an incumbent or a newcomer . If the new agent is also an incumbent , then the incumbent is no longer selected at random . Instead , one uses step two : With probability q the second incumbent is selected from the set of incumbents that have already collaborated with incumbent “4” , while with probability 1 − q it is selected at random from the set of all incumbents . In the ﬁgure , the new agent is selected from the pool of node “4” previous collaborators . Finally , one repeats step one to determine if the third agent in the team is an incumbent or a newcomer . In the ﬁgure , a newcomer is selected . ( B ) Time evolution of the network of collaborations according to the model for p = 0 . 5 , q = 0 . 5 and m = 3 . 14 Figure 3 : Predictions of the model . ( A ) Phase transition in the structure of the collaboration network . We plot only the largest cluster in the network . For small p , the network is formed by numerous small clusters ( p = 0 . 10 ) . At the critical point p c —the “tipping point”—a large cluster emerges , that is , a cluster that contains a signiﬁcant fraction of the agents . In the vicinity of the transition , the largest cluster has an almost linear or branched structure ( p = 0 . 30 ) . As one increases p , the largest cluster starts to have loops ( p = 0 . 35 ) and , eventually , becomes a densely connected cluster containing essentially all nodes in the network ( p = 0 . 60 ) . We show results for q = 0 . 5 and m = 4 , where m is the number of agents in a team . ( B ) The transition described in ( A ) can be characterized by the fraction S of nodes that belong to the giant component—the order parameter . We display graphically the value of S as a function of p and q . Note that for any value of q , the model displays a percolation transition as the fraction p of incumbents increases from 0 to 1 , and that the critical fraction p c depends on q , deﬁning a percolation line p c ( m , q ) . The critical line p c ( m , q ) is an increasing function of q . Note , also , that the critical line also depends on the size m of the teams . We show results for m = 4 . Even though the order parameter S is an important parameter to quantify the structure of the network , not all points with the same S , that is , all points represented with the same color , correspond to ﬁelds with identical properties . This result is made clear by the lines of equal probability of fraction f R of repeat incumbent - incumbent collaborations . The upper - right corner of the ( p , q ) plane is characterized by f R close to one , while the lower - left corner corresponds to f R close to zero . As we show in Fig . 4 , all ﬁelds considered have parameter values abobe the transition line . Table 1 : Global network properties of the ﬁelds studied . The sources for the BMI are : ( i ) Broadway Musicals Show by Show ( 12 ) , and ( ii ) The Musicals No One Came to See ( 13 ) . The data analyzed excludes revivals and focus on the “steady state” period 1940 – 1985 . The data for scientiﬁc publications was obtained from Web of Science R (cid:176) . We selected recognized journals in each of the different scientiﬁc ﬁelds ( see Table 2 ) . For each ﬁeld we show the total number of agents in all the period considered , the values of p and q obtained from the model , the fraction f R of repeat incumbent - incumbent links , the size N of the network in the last year of the period considered , the value N mod predicted by the model , the fraction S of agents that belong to the largest cluster , and the value S mod predicted by the model . Note that , by deﬁnition , S takes values between 0 and 1 and does not depend on the size of the network ( 30 ) .

Degree distributions for : ( A ) the Broad - way musical industry , ( B ) the ﬁeld of social psychology , ( C ) the ﬁeld of ecology , and ( D ) the ﬁeld of astronomy . Lines correspond to simulation results and symbols to empirical data . Simu - lations are carried out using the sequence { m ( t ) } of team sizes found in the empirical data , and with the values of p and q estimated from the measured fractions of the different types of links . We present the predictions of the model with the lines and the empirical degree distributions with the open circles . For all cases considered , the data falls within the 95 % conﬁdence inter - vals of the predictions of the model . The ( p , q ) parameter - space of the network of collaborators for : ( E ) the Broadway musical industry , ( F ) the ﬁeld of social psychology , ( G ) the ﬁeld of ecol - ogy , and ( H ) the ﬁeld of astronomy . The solid lines , separating the red and the blue regions , indicate the values of p and q for which 50 % of the nodes belong to the largest cluster , that is , the percolation transition at which a giant component—the invisible college—emerges . The distance from the percolation line predicts the overall structure of the network . For example , the networks in astronomy is well above the “tipping” line and has a very dense structure ( see Table 1 ) . In contrast , all other ﬁelds are close to the transition and have relatively sparse giant components . Another important characteristic of the network is provided by the value of the fraction f R of repeat incumbent - incumbent links . To help with the interpretation of the results , we plot with dotted lines the curves f R = 0 . 32 . For three of the creative networks considered , we ﬁnd f R < 0 . 25 . For astronomy , we ﬁnd f R = 0 . 39 . Figure 5 : Relation between team assembly mechanisms , network structure , and performance . We calculate the values of p , q , and S for several journals in each of the three scientiﬁc ﬁelds considered . Note that , in a few cases , q should be larger than one in order to reproduce the empirical values of f R —in this cases q is considered one and the corresponding points are shaded . We plot the values of p , q , and S as a function of the impact factor of the journal , and then use the Spearman rank - order correlation coefﬁcient r s to determine signiﬁcant correlations . A correlation is considered signiﬁcant if the probability P ( r s ) is smaller than 5 % . Shaded graphs indicate signiﬁcantly correlated variables . 17
