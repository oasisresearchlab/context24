To identify proteins that regulate the kinetochore we used 29 a genome - wide fluorescence microscopy approach . We combined an array of 30 mutants of either non - essential gene deletions or essential temperature - sensitive 31 alleles with fluorescently tagged spindle pole bodies ( centrosome ) and outer 32 kinetochores . Quantitative and qualitative analysis revealed mutants that affect 33 the levels and distribution of kinetochores respectively . These mutants are 34 enriched for those involved in mRNA processing , chromatin organization , DNA 35 replication / repair and mitosis . Our data show that the Pkc1 kinase maintains the 36 kinetochore focus via its ability to prevent cell stress and this phenotype is 37 rescued by an osmotic stabilizer . These data support the notion that kinetochore 38 and microtubule homeostasis are perturbed by the stress response pathways . 39 Hence this observation provides a candidate mechanism for extracellular stress 40 leading to chromosome segregation defects . 41 42 43 .

Defects in chromosome segregation lead to aneuploidy , in 47 which daughter cells have gained and / or lost whole chromosomes . Aneuploid 48 cells are a hallmark of cancer tissue and aneuploidy may aid aspects of 49 tumourigenesis or tumour evolution ( de Bruin et al , 2014 ; Sotillo et al , 2007 ; 50 Weaver et al , 2007 ) . To prevent aneuploidy , cells carefully regulate the structure 51 and function of their kinetochores to ensure accurate chromosome segregation . 52 The budding yeast kinetochore provides perhaps the simplest model of a 53 eukaryotic kinetochore , since it assembles on a single nucleosome of a short 54 ‘point’ centromere , yet many of the genes encoding yeast kinetochore proteins 55 are well conserved with those of mammals . Despite the simplicity of the budding 56 yeast kinetochore , it is a large complex , consisting of at least 60 different 57 proteins , many present in multiple copies ( Biggins , 2013 ; Westermann et al , 58 2007 ) . The first step in assembling kinetochores is the loading of a centromere 59 specific variant of histone H3 , Cse4 , which then recruits the remaining 60 kinetochore proteins ( Collins et al , 2005 ) . The key function of the fully assembled 61 kinetochore is to link chromosomes to microtubules ( MTs ) ; this function is 62 achieved primarily by the NDC80 complex ( Cheeseman et al , 2006 ; DeLuca & 63 Musacchio , 2012 ) . The kinetochore’s ability to maintain MT attachment is 64 complicated by the dynamically extending and shrinking nature of the ‘plus’ end 65 .

The heterodecameric DAM1 - DASH complex is critical for this function 66 and forms the most distal part of the kinetochore from the centromeric 67 nucleosome ( Joglekar et al , 2006 ; Shang et al , 2003 ) . The DAM1 - DASH complex 68 requires the NDC80 complex for loading onto microtubules ( Lampert et al , 2013 ; 69 Maure et al , 2011 ) . Sixteen DAM1 - DASH decamers can encircle a MT in vitro , 70 forming a ring ( Gonen et al , 2012 ; Miranda et al , 2005 ; Ramey et al , 2011 ; Wang 71 et al , 2007 ; Westermann et al , 2005 ) . The genes encoding components of the 72 DAM1 - DASH complex are not conserved in mammalian cells , but the SKA 73 complex appear to serve an analogous function , for example see ( Jeyaprakash 74 et al , 2012 ) . 75 Although the constituents of the kinetochore are well characterized ( Biggins , 76 2013 ; Westermann et al , 2007 ) , the proteins that regulate its function are less 77 clearly defined . Key exceptions are the spindle assembly checkpoint ( SAC ) and 78 the Aurora kinase B , which act by phosphorylating specific kinetochore proteins 79 to delay anaphase or release microtubules respectively , for reviews see 80 ( Carmena et al , 2012 ; Jia et al , 2013 ; Musacchio & Salmon , 2007 ) . There are 81 multiple other examples of protein modifications affecting kinetochore function , 82 for example methylation by Set1 ( Zhang et al , 2005 ) , ubiquitylation by Psh1 83 ( Hewawasam et al , 2010 ; Ranjitkar et al , 2010 ) or phosphorylation by the ATR 84 orthologue , Mec1 ( Strecker et al , 2016 ) . However , we predict that other proteins 85 that regulate kinetochores remain to be identified , based upon the large groups of 86 proteins that have been found to affect the morphology of the mitotic spindle 87 .

In an attempt to identify novel regulators of the kinetochore , 89 we performed a genome - wide screen of mutants of both non - essential and 90 essential genes to detect changes in the levels and localization of the DAM1 - 91 DASH component , Dad4 . Our analysis reveals a set of mutants that are enriched 92 for those involved in chromosome segregation but also , DNA replication and 93 repair , chromatin organization , mRNA processing and splicing . We were 94 surprised to find a Dad4 - YFP phenotype produced both by mutants that affect 95 actin and the cell wall integrity pathway kinase , Pkc1 . PKC1 mutants produce a 96 CIN phenotype ( Stirling et al , 2011 ) , therefore we examined their kinetochore 97 phenotype in more detail . We find that PKC1’s effect upon the kinetochore likely 98 acts via actin and MT stability , since the phenotype can be recapitulated with 99 mutants or drugs that disrupt their function . This work establishes a mechanistic 100 link between the stress response pathways and the kinetochore / mitotic spindle 101 and suggests that stress plays an important role in kinetochore homeostasis . 102 103 .

Dad4 is a member of the outer 108 kinetochore DAM1 - DASH complex and Spc42 is a structural protein within the 109 spindle pole body ( SPB ) . Both of these fluorescently - tagged alleles are at their 110 endogenous loci under the control of their native promoters . Fluorescence 111 imaging shows stereotypical yeast kinetochore and SPB foci ( Fig 1A ) . These 112 yeast strains also contain haploid specific marker genes ( Tong & Boone , 2007 ) to 113 allow us to use the Synthetic Genetic Array ( SGA ) methodology ( Tong et al , 114 2001 ) to combine the two fluorescently - tagged proteins with arrays of mutants . 115 We used SGA to combine the DAD4 - YFP and SPC42 - RFP alleles with the non - 116 essential deletion collection ( Winzeler et al , 1999 ) , which includes 4746 separate 117 viable deletion strains , to systematically assess the effect of specific mutations on 118 the kinetochore ( Fig 1B ) . The resulting haploid strains were imaged on agar pads 119 using wide - field epi - flourescence microscopy . We included 1302 copies of a 120 control strain to assess variability of the assay ( a deletion of the HIS3 gene , 121 which is also absent in the BY4742 genetic background of the other deletions 122 strains ) . To examine the impact of essential genes on the kinetochore , we 123 employed a collection of temperature - sensitive ( ts ) alleles ( Li et al , 2011 ) ( 1334 124 members , include 754 unique alleles of 475 unique ORFs ) .

Since we used a 127 high numerical aperture objective lens ( 63x , 1 . 4NA ) , we were able to optically 128 section through the yeast cells to produce 3 - dimensional images ( all of the image 129 data from this screen is available via the Open Microscopy Environment , Image 130 Data Repository , idr - demo . openmicroscopy . org with the accession identifier 131 ‘idr0011’ ) . These images were then analyzed using a fully automated image 132 analysis protocol ( Ledesma - Fernandez & Thorpe , 2015 ) ; we quantified the 133 fluorescence intensity of each focus in each image . The fluorescence intensity is 134 a measure of the local protein concentration at the kinetochore and has been 135 widely used to measure kinetochore protein abundance ( Joglekar et al , 2008 ; 136 Joglekar et al , 2006 ) . 137 The kinetochore intensities for all the strains analyzed shows a near - normal 138 distribution and the yeast strains that differ most from the overall mean are 139 enriched for mutants over controls ( Fig 1C and Fig 1 source data ) . For the 140 essential ts mutants we found a larger spread of Dad4 - YFP fluorescence ( Fig 141 1D ) . In addition to the fully - automated quantitative analysis , we also manually 142 examined all of the images to determine which did not have a standard 143 stereotyped kinetochore localization of Dad4 - YFP . Such a kinetochore phenotype 144 would potentially be missed by quantitative measurements . We found 85 non - 145 essential mutants that had such a phenotype ( for examples see Fig 1E and Fig 1 146 source data ) . Many of these ( 48 out of the 85 ) were already identified in our 147 .

We did not 148 include any of the essential ts mutants in this “visual foci phenotype” category 149 since most strains that we examined would have scored as having aberrant 150 kinetochores . 151 We retested 338 non - essential mutant strains that included the most extreme 152 variants in Dad4 - YFP intensity ( high and low ) and strains with a visual 153 kinetochore phenotype , 45 copies of the control strain and 146 strains that we 154 chose to retest based upon either their annotations related to spindle function or 155 established links with the other high / low - Dad4 - YFP mutants . Of 224 non - 156 essential mutants that produced a Dad4 - YFP phenotype in the primary screen 157 ( high - intensity , low - intensity or visual ) and that we were able to score in the 158 secondary screen , 192 consistently gave a phenotype ( 86 % , Fig 1 source data ) . 159 Additionally , we were unable to score 20 mutants in the secondary screen that 160 produced a Dad4 - YFP phenotype in the primary screen and , based upon the 161 high validation rate , we include these in our final list of mutants affecting Dad4 - 162 YFP . Consequently , our screen identifies 175 non - essential deletion mutants that 163 affect Dad4 - YFP levels ( 72 that decrease Dad4 - YFP foci intensity , 103 that 164 increase intensity ; Fig 1 source data ) and 37 additional mutants that produce a 165 visual phenotype . We retested essential temperature sensitive alleles that had 166 Dad4 - YFP levels < 200 relative units and > 400 relative units . Strains that had 167 aberrant Dad4 - YFP levels in both the primary and retest screens were 168 considered further ( Fig 1 source data ) . 67 essential alleles decrease Dad4 - YFP 169 .

Interestingly , some of the alleles of the ts 170 collection are present in multiple copies since they were acquired from different 171 sources . We find that these alleles can sometimes differ with one giving high 172 intensity Dad4 - YFP foci and the other giving low intensity foci ( referred to as “low , 173 high” in Fig 1 source data ) . An example of this is the cdc20 - 1 allele , which 174 consistently gave both high and low intensity foci from different isolates . In total 175 116 ts alleles gave a Dad4 - YFP intensity phenotype , corresponding to 102 176 separate open reading frames . We found that a large proportion ( ~ 27 % ) of the 177 essential alleles affect Dad4 - YFP levels ( Fig 1D and Fig 1 source data ) , which 178 contrasts with only ~ 3 % of non - essential genes affecting Dad4 - YFP levels . In 179 total , therefore , we have identified 314 genes , whose mutants produce a Dad4 - 180 YFP phenotype ( Fig 1 source data ) . 181 Global analysis 182 To examine these mutants collectively we asked which gene ontology terms are 183 enriched using the GOrilla algorithm ( http : / / cbl - gorilla . cs . technion . ac . il / ( Eden et 184 al , 2009 ) ) . This analysis revealed enrichment of categories predicted to impact 185 kinetochore function such as chromosome segregation and regulation of 186 chromosome segregation ( enrichment p values 4x10 - 5 and 5x10 - 7 , respectively ) 187 We also found that enriched categories include terms that we had not anticipated 188 Fig 1F e . g . mRNA Processing , RNA helicase activity and splicing . These include 189 three key members of the nonsense - mediated mRNA decay ( NMD ) pathway 190 ( NMD2 , NAM7 and UPF3 ) . In addition , we found enrichment categories involved 191 .

For example , we found six members of the mediator 193 complex ( MED2 , PGD1 , ROX3 , SRB2 , SOH1 and TAF14 ) , three members of the 194 RSC chromatin - remodeling complex ( RSC1 , RSC2 and LDB7 ) and three 195 members of the SAGA complex ( NGG1 , SGF29 and SPT7 ) . 196 We expected CIN mutants would show significant variability in their kinetochore 197 foci intensities from cell to cell since we have previously found this to be true in 198 selected cases where the intensity of Dad4 - YFP was increased , for example 199 hmo1 ∆ and mad1 ∆ ( Berry et al , 2016 ; Ledesma - Fernandez & Thorpe , 2015 ) 200 both of which were identified in this screen . Consistent with this notion , we 201 identified 98 of the 723 CIN genes ( Stirling et al , 2011 ) , an enrichment p - value of 202 10 - 14 . We also note that a number of mutants were identified in the 203 threonine / serine biosynthetic pathway : hom2 ∆ , hom3 ∆ , aat2 ∆ and thr1 ∆ ( Fig S1 204 A , Fig 1 source data ) . For example , hom2 ∆ cells showed increased and highly 205 variable levels or Dad - YFP at kinetochore focus ( Fig S1 B , C and D ) . However , 206 our media for both the SGA and microscopy does not contain serine or threonine . 207 Supplementing the media with those amino acids rescued the kinetochore 208 phenotype ( Fig S1 B , C and D ) . Other notable complexes identified in this Dad4 - 209 YFP screen were members of the RSC and SWI / SNF chromatin remodeling 210 complexes ( Fig S2 ) , the mitotic exit network ( Fig 1E dbf2 ∆ and Fig 1 source 211 data ) , microtubule associated proteins and the kinetochore ( Fig S3 ) . Mutants of 212 kinetochore and associated genes gave diverse Dad4 - YFP phenotypes , for 213 . CC - BY - NC 4 . 0 International license peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder .

In contrast ask1 - 2 and spc34 - ts have elevated levels of 216 Dad4 - YFP in their kinetochore foci , whereas dam1 - 5 and duo1 - 2 reduce the 217 levels of Dad4 - YFP ( Fig S3F ) . We also identified multiple components of the 218 Nonsense - Mediated mRNA decay pathway ( NMD ) that serves to degrade RNA 219 and regulate gene expression ( He et al 1997 ) . Several kinetochore RNAs have 220 been shown to increase in NMD mutants ( Dahlseid et al 19898 , Kebaara et al 221 2009 ) . Deletion of the NMD genes UPF3 , NAM7 and NMD2 all had high levels of 222 Dad4 - YFP with considerable variability ( Fig S4 ) . 223 224 Protein Kinase C 225 One of the 107 CIN mutants that affected Dad4 - YFP was an allele of the PKC1 226 gene , which encodes the only Protein Kinase C in budding yeast ( Pkc1 ) . Pkc1 is 227 an essential kinase that functions in the Cell Wall Integrity ( CWI ) pathway in 228 addition to multiple other roles throughout the cell ( Levin , 2005 ; Levin et al , 229 1990 ) . Mammalian cells have multiple PKC isoforms , which also have diverse 230 functions ( Mellor & Parker , 1998 ) . Mutations in yeast PKC1 have a chromosomal 231 instability phenotype ( Stirling et al , 2011 ) despite Pkc1 localizing to the cell 232 periphery and bud neck . Three PKC1 temperature - sensitive mutant alleles were 233 tested in the screen and we found the more severe the phenotype the lower the 234 reported restrictive temperature for the allele ( Fig 1 source data ) . We retested the 235 . CC - BY - NC 4 . 0 International license peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder .

At the higher 236 temperature we confirmed that many of the pkc1 - 1 cells had lost their Dad4 - YFP 237 foci whereas Spc42 - RFP foci was still present ( Fig 2A and B ) . To confirm that the 238 Dad4 - YFP phenotype in pkc1 - 1 cells was caused by a failure in Pkc1 , we next 239 added back a wild - type copy of the PKC1 gene at the URA3 locus and found that 240 this was sufficient to rescue the Dad4 - YFP foci phenotype in the pkc1 - 1 strain at 241 37˚C ( Fig 2C and D ) . 242 To confirm that the kinetochore phenotype seen in pkc1 - 1 cells was not 243 dependent upon high - temperature , we used an ‘auxin - induced degradation’ ( AID ) 244 system ( Morawska & Ulrich , 2013 ; Nishimura et al , 2009 ) . This approach uses a 245 short AID tag fused to Pkc1 and AID - specific E3 ubiquitin ligase ( AFB2 ) . The 246 interaction between the AID domain and AFB2 is dependent upon the plant 247 hormone auxin ( indole - 3 - acetic acid ) . In a strain encoding Dad4 - YFP and Spc42 - 248 RFP , we fused the endogenous PKC1 gene with an AID tag ( PKC1 - AID ) and 249 integrated the AFB2 gene at the URA3 locus . We found that after addition of 500 250 µM auxin , Pkc1 is depleted ( Fig 2E ) and the proportion of cells without visible 251 Dad4 - YFP foci increased ( Fig 2F and G ) . These data confirm that the kinetochore 252 phenotype of the pkc1 - 1 can be recapitulated by depletion of Pkc1 . We noted that 253 the AFB2 gene was particularly unstable in this strain suggesting that Pkc1 254 degradation is partially active even without auxin , a previously reported effect 255 ( Morawska & Ulrich , 2013 ) .

We transferred 265 the pkc1 - 1 : : KANMX allele into strains encoding Dad3 - YFP , Mtw1 - YFP or Ndc10 - 266 GFP representing kinetochore components in the outer DAM1 - DASH , central and 267 inner kinetochore complexes respectively ( Fig 3A ) . Upon shifting to the higher 268 temperature we found that , in each case , the proportion of cells with visible 269 kinetochore foci decreased ( Fig 3B , C and D ) . Thus , the effect of perturbing Pkc1 270 is not specific to Dad4 or the DAM1 - DASH complex , but extends to the inner 271 kinetochore proteins . Thus , mutation of PKC1 is sufficient to cause an aberrant 272 kinetochore phenotype . 273 We noticed that in pkc1 - 1 cells , small additional Dad4 - YFP foci could be 274 observed even at the lower temperature ( Fig 2A and C ) . Also Dad4 - YFP foci in 275 the pkc1 - 1 ura3 - 1 : : PKC1 : : URA3 strain do not appear entirely normal , with 276 multiple foci in some cells ( Fig 2C ) . This suggests that non - lethal disruption of 277 Pkc1 is sufficient to perturb the kinetochore . In yeast all 16 278 .

The additional kinetochore foci lead us to ask whether the pkc1 - 1 280 kinetochore phenotype is consistent with kinetochore de - clustering . To test this 281 notion we monitored the Dad4 - YFP phenotype over time after shifting pkc1 - 1 282 cells to the non - permissive temperature . We find that the proportion of cells with 283 Dad4 - YFP foci decreases over time ( Fig 3E ) . Furthermore , small disperse foci 284 appear in cells at early time points , consistent with de - clustering of kinetochores 285 after the shift to the non - permissive temperature ( Fig 3F ) . 286 PKC1 is an essential gene whose product functions downstream of Rho1 in the 287 CWI pathway ( Fig 4A ) ( Levin et al , 1990 ) . PKC1 mutants die due to osmotic 288 stress and this lethality can be rescued by the addition of an osmotic stabilizer , 289 such as 1 M sorbitol ( Paravicini et al , 1992 ) . To test whether the kinetochore 290 phenotype was linked to a failure in CWI , we attempted to rescue the kinetochore 291 phenotype of pkc1 - 1 cells with sorbitol . pkc1 - 1 cells were grown at 37˚C for 5 292 hours with or without sorbitol and Dad4 - YFP signal assessed by microscopy . We 293 found that 1 M sorbitol is sufficient to rescue the visible disappearance of Dad4 294 foci ( Fig 4B and C ) , however , the rescued cells had additional foci suggesting 295 either non - kinetochore clusters of Dad4 or partially declustered centromeres . 296 These data suggest that osmotic stress contributes significantly to the Dad4 - YFP 297 phenotype . However , mutants of the other members of the CWI pathway ( Rom2 , 298 Bck1 , Mkk1 , Mkk2 and Slt2 ) show no comparable Dad4 - YFP phenotype with the 299 exception of stl2 Δ ( Fig S5B ) . We asked whether the canonical stress response 300 . CC - BY - NC 4 . 0 International license peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder .

Hog1 is the canonical mitogen - 301 activated protein ( MAP ) kinase in yeast and is activated in response to stress 302 ( Brewster et al , 1993 ) . We probed whole cell extracts from pkc1 - 1 cells and find 303 that Hog1 is phosphorylated consistent with an activated stress response 304 pathway although both at the permissive and restrictive temperatures ( Fig S5C ) . 305 These data show that while the Dad4 phenotype of pkc1 - 1 mutants is linked to 306 stress , this is not entirely dependent upon the CWI MAP kinase cascade 307 pathway . 308 Since sorbitol was able to partially rescue the Dad4 phenotype of PKC1 mutants 309 we looked for a connection between osmotic / cell wall stress and spindle biology . 310 We noted that in the Dad4 - YFP screen we identified a class of mutants related to 311 actin dynamics ( Fig 4D , Fig 1 source data ) . These include actin itself ( e . g . act1 - 312 101 / 105 / 121 / 133 / 136 / 159 ) , myosin ( myo2 - 16 ) , members of the Arp2 / 3 complex 313 ( e . g . arp2 - 14 , arp3 - F306G , las17 - 13 ) and others ( Fig 1 source data ) . There is 314 precedent for cytoskeletal defects leading to MT defects in fission yeast , where 315 osmotic stress induces depolymerisation of the actin cytoskeleton and a 316 perturbation in microtubule dynamics ( Robertson & Hagan , 2008 ) . Furthermore , 317 mutants that affect the cell wall are important for MT stability ( LAS17 , ECM27 , 318 SUR7 , ECM33 , ECM8 , HLR1 and KTR1 ) ( Vizeacoumar et al , 2010 ) . If both pkc1 - 319 1 and the actin mutants disrupt normal microtubule dynamics then we expected 320 that a direct disruption of microtubule function would lead to a Dad4 phenotype . 321 Indeed , we identified a number of MT associated proteins required for normal 322 .

To test this notion we used the microtubule destabilizing drug 324 thiabendazole ( TBZ ) to examine the effects upon Dad4 - YFP foci . After addition of 325 increasing amounts of TBZ we saw an increase in cells lacking Dad4 - YFP foci 326 ( Fig 4E and F ) . Interestingly , we noted that this phenotype is partially rescued by 327 the addition of 1 M sorbitol , suggesting that sorbitol may do more than simply 328 protect cells from osmotic shock ( Fig 4E ) . These data highlight two points , first 329 that disruption of MTs or MT dynamics could underlie Dad4 kinetochore 330 phenotypes in the pkc1 - 1 and actin mutants , and second that sorbitol may 331 stabilize MTs – a notion supported by previous studies ( Gerson - Gurwitz et al , 332 2009 ; Korolyev et al , 2005 ) . 333 Synthetic Physical Interactions 334 There is evidence that Pkc1 may act on nuclear proteins directly , since removal 335 of a domain from the N - terminus of Pkc1 ( HR1 ) leads to its localization to the 336 mitotic spindle ( Denis & Cyert , 2005 ) . Furthermore , there are reported physical 337 interactions between Pkc1 and the kinetochore proteins Nnf1 , Nuf2 and Spc105 338 ( Wang et al , 2012 ) . We did not detect Pkc1 at the kinetochore by fluorescence 339 imaging of a Pkc1 - GFP strain ( Fig S5D ) and Pkc1 has not been isolated with 340 purified kinetochores ( Akiyoshi et al , 2010 ; Ranjitkar et al , 2010 ) . However , we 341 wanted to ask whether forced recruitment of Pkc1 to the kinetochore would lead 342 to a mitotic phenotype . To test this , we made use of the Synthetic Physical 343 Interaction ( SPI ) system to separately associate Pkc1 with kinetochore and 344 .

The SPI system uses an 345 antibody fragment that binds to GFP , the GFP - binding protein ( GBP ) , which is 346 fused to Pkc1 , to bind to GFP - tagged proteins in the cell . The GBP includes an 347 RFP tag to enable colocalization to be monitored by fluorescence imaging . We 348 used plasmids encoding the GBP alone , Pkc1 - GBP ( wildtype Pkc1 ) , pkc1 - ha - 349 GBP ( a constitutively hyperactive mutant of Pkc1 , pkc1 - R398A - R405A - K406A 350 ( Martin et al , 2000 ) and pkc1 - kd - GBP ( a kinase dead version of Pkc1 , pkc1 - 351 K853R ( Watanabe et al , 1994 ) ) . These plasmids were separately transferred into 352 159 GFP strains including kinetochore proteins , members of the CWI pathway 353 and actin related proteins ( Fig 5 source data ) . We confirmed that Pkc1 - GBP was 354 co - localizing with endogenously GFP - tagged kinetochore using fluorescence 355 imaging . We found that the GFP - GBP binding is sufficient to cause considerable 356 relocalization of Pkc1 to the kinetochore in all cases ( Fig 5A ) , consistent with 357 previous observations ( Berry et al , 2016 ; Olafsson & Thorpe , 2015 ) . We found 358 that a number of haploid strains , which contain only a single endogenously 359 encoded copy of the GFP tagged protein , are restricted , for growth when 360 expressing Pck1 - GBP . The strongest SPI caused by Pkc1 - GBP is with Bck1 - GFP 361 ( Fig 5B , Fig 5 source data ) . Bck1 is the downstream target of Pkc1 in the CWI 362 pathway ( Fig 4A ) . In addition , association of Pkc1 with other MAP kinases further 363 downstream in the CWI pathway also led to a growth defect ( Mkk1 , Mkk2 and 364 Slt2 ) ( Fig 5B , Fig 5 source data ) . From the kinetochore , we found that Ndc10 , 365 Cse4 , Dad3 , Dad4 , Ctf19 , Okp1 , Cep3 all gave SPIs with Pck1 ( Fig 5B , C and 366 .

Also , some SPB components such as Spc42 had SPIs with 367 Pkc1 ( Fig 5B , Fig 5 source data ) . To test whether these effects were specific for 368 the kinase activity of Pkc1 , we compared the growth defects caused by Pck1 - 369 GBP , pkc1 - ha - GBP and pkc1 - kd - GBP . We found that downstream members of 370 the CWI pathway are strongly sensitive to either Pck1 - GBP or pkc1 - ha - GBP but 371 not to pkc1 - kd - GBP , except Bck1 - GFP that is sensitive to all three Pkc1 - GBP 372 versions ( Fig 5C ) . From the kinetochore proteins , Dad3 showed a strong growth 373 defect with Pck1 - GBP or pkc1 - ha - GBP but not to pkc1 - kd - GBP ( Fig 5C ) . It is 374 possible that some of these SPIs are caused by mislocalization of the GFP - 375 tagged protein ( caused by association with the Pkc1 - GBP ) . To address this we 376 repeated the SPI screen in heterozygously GFP - tagged diploid strains . In these 377 strains there is one allele of a gene linked to GFP and the other allele is not 378 tagged . Thus , if the GFP - tagged protein is mislocalized , then the untagged 379 version may be able to complement the defect . We compared again the growth 380 defects caused by Pck1 - GBP , pkc1 - ha - GBP and pkc1 - kd - GBP in these 381 heterozygous diploids ( Fig 5D and E ) . We found that the only proteins that 382 produce a SPI when comparing pkc1 - ha - GBP with pkc1 - kd - GBP are the four 383 downstream MAP kinases in the CWI pathway : Bck1 , Mkk1 , Mkk2 and Slt2 ( Fig 384 5D and E ) . However , when comparing Pkc1 - GBP with pkc1 - kd - GBP , only the 385 immediate downstream MAP kinase ( Bck1 ) is a SPI ( Fig 5D and E ) . 386 Thus , although we cannot rule out a direct role for Pkc1 at the yeast kinetochore , 387 we find that constitutive recruitment of Pkc1 to kinetochores does not result in a 388 .

This is further 389 supported by the ability of sorbitol to rescue the pkc1 - 1 kinetochore phenotype . 390 These data suggest that pkc1 - 1 mutants activate a stress response pathway that 391 indirectly leads to the disassembly of the kinetochore cluster . Since previous 392 work has demonstrated cell stress results in altered MT dynamics ( Robertson & 393 Hagan , 2008 ) , we examined whether microtubules were affected by disruption of 394 Pkc1 . We used the Pkc1 - AID inducible degron system in a strain that contains 395 Dad4 - YFP , Spc42 - RFP and tubulin ( Tub1 ) tagged at the N - terminus with 396 mTurquois ( mTurq - Tub1 , a fluorescent version of Tub1 that minimized the 397 perturbation of MT function ( Markus et al , 2015 ) ) . We induced Pkc1 - AID 398 degradation for 3 hours to identify cells as their kinetochore foci start to dissever . 399 We find that a significant proportion of cells have altered kinetochore ( Fig 6A ) 400 and that these cells have aberrant MTs ( Fig 6B ) . The Pkc1 depleted cells appear 401 to have hyperstable MTs compared with controls , and the extra - kinetochore foci 402 are associated with these MTs ( Fig 6B ) . Thus , these observations support the 403 notion that the kinetochore phenotype seen in Pkc1 deficient cells is associated 404 with altered MT stability . These data therefore provide a link between the stress 405 response pathways and kinetochore function . 406 Discussion 407 We have performed a genome - wide screen to determine the pathways regulating 408 the function of the outer kinetochore protein Dad4 , part of the DAM1 - DASH 409 complex . This complex is an essential component of the outer kinetochore that 410 . CC - BY - NC 4 . 0 International license peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder . It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint ( which was not . http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 078196 doi : bioRxiv preprint first posted online Sep . 28 , 2016 ; 20 stabilizes the interaction between kinetochores and the dynamic ends of spindle 411 MTs . The Dad4 screen revealed 315 ORFs that affect the levels and / or 412 localization of this protein at the kinetochore foci . A significant proportion of these 413 mutants also produce a CIN phenotype ( Stirling et al , 2011 ) ( enrichment p - value 414 = 5x10 - 14 ) suggesting that they play a role in chromosome segregation . The 415 mutants are also enriched for those that are sensitive to gamma irradiation , 416 hydroxyurea and benomyl ( enrichment p - values 2x10 - 14 , 9x10 - 10 and 7x10 - 8 417 respectively ) . Despite these enrichments , the mutants that perturb Dad4 - YFP do 418 not include classical DNA repair genes such as RAD51 or MRE11 but rather 419 genes involved in mitosis and checkpoint function ( there are some exceptions 420 such as the nuclease gene APN1 ) . The mutant list was also enriched for genes 421 involved in RNA metabolism , transport , the nuclear pore and transcription ( Fig 422 1F ) . 423 We investigated the role of one particular mutant , pkc1 - 1 , in more detail since 424 this evolutionary conserved kinase is important for accurate chromosome 425 segregation ( Stirling et al , 2011 ) , yet the Pkc1 kinase has no known role at the 426 yeast kinetochore . We found that loss of Pkc1 led to kinetochore declustering and 427 loss of kinetochore foci ( Fig 2 and 3 ) . Recently , a mitotic role for Protein Kinase 428 epsilon ( PKC ε ) has been discovered in mammalian cells ( Brownlow et al , 2014 ; 429 Saurin et al , 2008 ) . PKC ε regulates the localization of SAC proteins , 430 BubR1 / Mad3 and Bub1 to kinetochores , and in its absence cells progress 431 prematurely through mitosis . These data suggest a direct role for PKC ε at the 432 . CC - BY - NC 4 . 0 International license peer - reviewed ) is the author / funder .

We were not able to detect Pkc1 at the kinetochore using 433 fluorescent imaging ( Fig 5SD ) , nor has Pkc1 been isolated with purified 434 kinetochores ( Akiyoshi et al , 2010 ; Ranjitkar et al , 2010 ) . However , if Pkc1 were 435 to act only transiently or through the action of a small number of molecules , then 436 this would not be detected . To test whether Pkc1 has a direct effect at the 437 kinetochore we used the Synthetic Physical Interaction system to forcibly 438 associate Pkc1 to the kinetochore . Although we found that several kinetochore 439 proteins do perturb growth when forcibly bound to Pkc1 ( Fig 5C ) , these are likely 440 due to disruption of the function of essential kinetochore proteins , since the 441 phenotype is not present in heterozygously - tagged diploid cells , which include a 442 non - bound form of the kinetochore protein ( Fig 5 source data ) . However , we 443 cannot rule out a direct role for Pkc1 mediated phosphorylation at the 444 kinetochore , perhaps restricted to a specific point in the cell cycle . 445 Since the kinetochore phenotype of pkc1 - 1 cells was rescued by the addition of 446 the osmo - protectant sorbitol , we suggest that cells in which Pkc1 is perturbed are 447 activating stress response pathways that indirectly mediate the kinetochore 448 phenotype . There is precedent for the stress response pathways altering MT 449 dynamics ( Robertson & Hagan , 2008 ) in fission yeast . The effect of osmotic 450 stress was seen on filamentous actin and microtubules . Consistent with this , we 451 find that MTs appear hyper - stabilized in budding yeast cells depleted of Pkc1 ( Fig 452 6 ) . Thus , these data provide a rationale for the chromosomal instability 453 phenotype seen in PKC1 mutants . More broadly it may be anticipated that stress 454 .

It will be interesting to decipher which 456 stress response pathways contribute to the kinetochore phenotype and to 457 determine whether kinetochore structure is controlled in part by microtubule 458 dynamics . We see hyperactivation of the canonical Hog1 pathway , but since this 459 is active in pkc1 - 1 cells at the permissive temperature , there must be other 460 contributing factors . 461 462 .

Yeast were manipulated using standard methods 466 ( Sherman , 2002 ) ; ts strains were grown at 23˚C and then at non - permissive 467 temperatures as indicated in the text . 468 Synthetic Genetic Array ( SGA ) 469 Strains encoding fluorescently tagged spindle components Dad4 - YFP and 470 Spc42 - RFP ( T34 and T37 ) were mated with an array of gene deletions ( Winzeler 471 et al , 1999 ) or ts alleles ( Li et al , 2011 ) by combining the cells together on YPD 472 plates using a Singer ROTOR pinning robot ( Singer Instruments , UK ) . Diploids 473 were then selected by two cycles of growth on rich media containing geneticin 474 ( G418 ) , hygromycin ( HYG ) and nourseothricin ( NAT ) . These diploids were 475 sporulated for 2 weeks at 23˚C on sporulation medium .

Zeiss Immersol 486 518F immersion oil was used with a refractive index of 1 . 5181 . Fluorescence 487 illumination for the screen was provided by a 100W mercury bulb . Fluorescence 488 filter cubes were as follows : YFP imaging used Zeiss filter set 46 ( excitation BP 489 500 / 20 ; dichroic FT 515 , emission BP 535 / 30 ) , RFP imaging used Zeiss filter set 490 63HE ( excitation BP 572 / 25 ; dichroic FT 590 , emission BP 629 / 62 ) , GFP imaging 491 used Zeiss filter set 38HE ( excitation BP 470 / 40 ; dichroic FT 495 , emission BP 492 525 / 50 ) and CFP imaging used Zeiss filter set 47HE ( excitation BP 436 / 25 ; 493 dichroic FT455 , emission BP 480 / 40 ) . Later experiments employed a Zeiss 494 Colibri LED illumination system ( 445 nm for CFP excitation , 470 nm for GFP 495 excitation , 505 nm for YFP excitation and 590nm for RFP excitation ) , with the 496 filter cubes outlined above . A z stack of 21 images with a vertical separation of 497 350 nm was acquired for each strain . Brightfield contrast was enhanced with 498 differential interference contrast ( DIC ) prisms . The resulting light was captured 499 using a Hamamatsu ORCA ERII CCD camera with 6 . 45 µm pixels , binned 2x2 or 500 a Flash 4 . 0 Lte CMOS camera with 6 . 5 µm pixels , binned 2x2 ( Hamamatsu 501 Photonics , Japan ) .

Quantitative image analysis used an automated ImageJ 508 script , FociQuant to quantify the kinetochore fluorescence signal ( Ledesma - 509 Fernandez & Thorpe , 2015 ) . In brief , each kinetochore is identified automatically 510 using the ‘FindMaxima’ function in ImageJ . The fluoresecence intensity within a 511 ~ 600 nm square box in the focal plane of each foci is measured and a local 512 background signal for each focus is subtracted .

Plasmids encoding the GBP - tagged proteins and controls were 521 separately transferred into the GFP strains using ‘selective ploidy ablation’ ( SPA ) 522 ( Reid et al , 2011 ) . Arrays of 96 strains from the GFP collection were grown on 523 rectangular plates containing YPD media , typically at 1536 colonies per plate 524 density ( 16 replicates of each strain ) . After growth overnight , these MAT a plates 525 were copied onto new YPD plates with a lawn of donor MAT α yeast strain 526 containing a specific LEU2 plasmid .

To select for diploids , after the YPD mating step , the 533 colonies were copied onto media lacking histidine and leucine ( - His , - Leu ) to 534 select for both the plasmid and the GFP in the recipient strain . After 24 hours the 535 cells were copied onto fresh – His , - Leu plates . For both haploids and diploids the 536 plates were imaged using a desktop scanner in transmission mode ( minimum 537 resolution 300 dpi ) after 24 - 72 hours . Quantitative analysis of the resulting colony 538 size was performed as previously reported . First , the colony sizes on each plate 539 are normalized to a median value of 1 to account for plate to plate variations in 540 growth . Next , for each strain , the average colony size of the control was 541 compared with that of the experimental plasmid ( s ) to generate a growth ratio . 542 The natural log of the growth ratios is reported here for each strain ; LGR = ln 543 ( control size / experimental size ) . An LGR of 0 indicates equal size colonies on 544 experiment and control , whereas an LGR of 0 . 4 equates with an experimental 545 colony 67 % of the size of a control colony . 546 Protein extraction and Western Blot Analysis 547 Whole cell extracts where prepared by using trichloracetic acid ( TCA ) as 548 previously described ( Olafsson & Thorpe , 2015 ) .

The 750 haploid yeast strain encoding Dad4 - YFP ( green circle ) and Spc42 - RFP 751 ( purple circle ) is mated to an array of strains each of which contain a 752 specific mutation ( blue circle ) . The resulting diploids are sporulated and the 753 haploid progeny containing both a mutation and two tagged genes is 754 selected . 755 C The plot shows the quantitation of the levels of Dad4 - YFP in the non - 756 essential gene deletions from the lowest intensity ( left ) to the highest 757 intensity ( right ) . Each point represents the mean fluorescent intensity of 758 kinetochore foci for each strain . Control ( WT ) strains are indicated in blue 759 and mutants in green . The box - and - whisker plot ( inset ) shows the 760 distribution of the data of both the controls and mutants . The box and 761 whiskers plots indicate the median ( bar ) , quartiles ( box ) and 1 . 5 times the 762 interquartile range ( whiskers ) , with outliers plotted as dots . 763 D The plot shows the quantitation of the levels of Dad4 - YFP for the 764 temperature - sensitive ( ts ) strains plotted from the lowest intensity ( left ) to 765 .

The scale bars are 5 µm . 770 F Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of the mutants that perturb Dad4 - YFP 771 levels or localization reveal categories of proteins that we had not 772 anticipated to be related to kinetochore function . These included m RNA 773 processing ( p = 3x10 - 13 ) , RNA splicing ( p = 6x10 - 7 ) and spliceosomal snRNP 774 assembly ( p = 5x10 - 4 ) ( left panel ) . The mutants were also enriched for those 775 involved in the mitotic cell cycle ( p = 4x10 - 14 ) ; including DNA replication 776 ( p = 1x10 - 4 ) , PolII transcription elongation ( p = 7x10 - 5 ) and the nuclear pore 777 ( p = 1x10 - 4 ) ( right panel ) .

Scale bars are 5 µm . 791 D The proportion of pkc1 - 1 and complemented pkc1 - 1 PKC1 cells that have 792 lost their Dad4 - YFP foci is plotted after growth for 5 hours at either 23°C or 793 37°C . * * * indicates p values of less than 10 - 40 from Fisher exact tests . 794 E Analysis of whole cell protein extracts show that Pkc1 - AID protein is 795 depleted from cells after addition of 500 µM auxin . Phosphoglycerate kinase 796 ( Pgk1 ) is used as a loading control . Whole cell extract from cells 797 overexpressing PKC1 - AID - FLAG ( first lane ) and from cells with untagged 798 PKC1 ( second lane ) were used as positive and negative control , 799 respectively . 800 F The Dad4 - YFP phenotype of pkc1 - 1 cells can be largely recapitulated by 801 depleting Pkc1 after addition of auxin . Scale bars are 5 µm . 802 G The proportion of PKC1 - AID cells that have lost their Dad4 - YFP foci after 3 803 hours of treatment with 500 µM auxin . * * * indicates a p value of less than 804 10 - 50 from a Fishers exact test .

Pkc1 is activated by Rho1 and acts directly upon Bck1 . 837 B The Dad4 - YFP phenotype observed in pkc1 - 1 cells , after 5 hours of growth 838 at 37°C , is largely rescued by addition of 1M sorbitol . Although , we noted 839 that many pkc1 - 1 cells in sorbitol had multiple Dad4 - YFP foci ( white 840 arrowheads ) ; scale bars are 5 µm . 841 C The proportion of pkc1 - 1 cells that have lost their Dad4 - YFP foci are plotted 842 after growth for varying times at 37°C with and without sorbitol . Nearly half 843 of the pkc1 - 1 cells in sorbitol have multiple Dad4 - YFP foci . * * * indicates a p 844 value of 4x10 - 19 using Fishers exact test . 845 D Actin and microtubule ( MT ) mutants also cause a Dad4 - YFP kinetochore 846 phenotype ( Fig 1 source data ) . The nodes of the interaction map depict 847 genes whose mutants we identified to affect Dad4 levels or localization 848 ( light text ) or genes not identified in the screen but related to CWI or 849 kinetochore function ( dark text ) .

TBZ causes a proportion of cells to lose 855 their Dad4 foci . At high concentration ( 100 µg / ml ) TBZ produces a strong 856 kinetochore phenotype that can be partially rescued with sorbitol . n . s . 857 indicates not statistically significant ( p = 0 . 076 ) and * * * indicates p values 858 less than 10 - 15 all using Fishers exact test . 859 F An example of WT cells treated with 50 µg / ml TBZ for 10 minutes is shown . 860 The scale bars are 5 µm . 861 862 Figure 5 – Synthetic Physical Interactions with Pkc1 863 A The GBP - tagged versions of Pkc1 , pkc1 - kd and pkc1 - ha , all colocalize with 864 kinetochore proteins as assessed by fluorescence imaging .

GFP protein associations whose growth 882 effect is specific to pkc1 - ha - GBP are labeled in blue . GFP protein 883 associations whose growth effect are not specific , but are greater with the 884 Pkc1 - GBP and / or pkc1 - ha - GBP are labeled in yellow . 885 D Log Growth Ratio comparisons of diploid heterozygously GFP - tagged 886 strains expressing either PKC1 - GBP , PKC1 - KD - GBP or PKC1 - HA - GBP . 887 When comparing Pkc1 - GBP with pkc1 - kd - GBP , the only growth defect was 888 in Bck1 , the direct target of Pkc1 ( blue dots ) . When comparing pkc1 - ha - 889 GBP with pkc1 - kd - GBP , the four kinases in the CWI pathway downstream 890 of Pkc1 Bck1 , Mkk1 , Mkk2 and Slt2 ( red dots ) showed a growth defect . 891 E Examples of the strong growth defects produced by combining Pkc1 - GBP 892 pkc1 - kd - GBP or pkc1 - ha - GBP with GFP - tagged members of the CWI 893 pathway are shown ( See Fig 5 source data ) .
