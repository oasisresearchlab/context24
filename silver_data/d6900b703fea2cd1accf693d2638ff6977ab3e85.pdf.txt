It uses bifunctional small molecules to induce the ubiquitination and degradation of target proteins through the ubiquitin – proteasome system . PROTACs can not only be used as potential clinical treatments for diseases such as cancer , immune disorders , viral infections , and neurodegenerative diseases , but also provide unique chemical knockdown tools for biological research in a catalytic , reversible , and rapid manner . In 2019 , our group published a review article “ PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ” in the journal , summarizing the representative compounds of PROTACs reported before the end of 2019 . In the past 2 years , the entire ﬁ eld of protein degradation has experienced rapid development , including not only a large increase in the number of research papers on protein - degradation technology but also a rapid increase in the number of small - molecule degraders that have entered the clinical and will enter the clinical stage . In addition to PROTAC and molecular glue technology , other new degradation technologies are also developing rapidly . In this article , we mainly summarize and review the representative PROTACs of related targets published in 2020 – 2021 to present to researchers the exciting developments in the ﬁ eld of protein degradation . The problems that need to be solved in this ﬁ eld will also be brie ﬂ y introduced . Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 ; https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41392 - 022 - 00999 - 9 INTRODUCTION In 2001 , Crews group and Deshaies group reported the ﬁ rst example of PROTACs . 1 As a novel chemical biology technology , PROTACs present a chemical knockdown strategy by hijacking the ubiquitin – proteasome system with bifunctional small molecules that can simultaneously bind target protein and E3 ubiquitin ligase and induce the target protein to be ubiquitylated and then be degraded by proteasome ( Fig . 1 ) . In the past 20 years , especially since dBET1 PROTAC based on pomalidomide as the E3 ligase ligand successfully degraded BET protein in 2015 , 2 the ﬁ eld of PROTACs has ushered in a period of rapid development ( Fig . 2a ) . So far , a variety of PROTACs derived from different E3 ligase and protein ligands have been disclosed to achieve the degradation of various types of interesting proteins . Due to its unique mode of action , PROTACs technology has received great attention in the industry and has been applied to the possible treatment of cancers , immune disorders , viral infections , neurodegenerative diseases , etc . Arivinas , a clinical - stage biopharmaceutical company , recently disclosed the struc - tures of the androgen receptor ( AR ) degrader ARV - 110 and the estrogen - receptor ( ER ) degrader ARV - 471 ( Fig . 2b ) . 3 – 5 The previously announced results indicate that ARV - 110 is safe and effective for patients with metastatic castration - resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) . This is PROTAC ’ s ﬁ rst clinical trial data and presents a milestone in the transformation of PROTAC technology into a new treatment strategy . As the ﬁ rst targeted estrogen - receptor - degrading agent to enter clinical trials , ARV - 471 is another potential best - in - class drug that may bring hope to breast cancer patients . Besides the AR and ER targeting PROTAC molecules , more and more PROTAC degraders have entered the clinical trial stage in the past 2 years . For instance , the new targets of these PROTAC molecules include BCL - xL , IRAK4 , STAT3 , BTK , BRD9 , MDM2 , etc . , among which most are the ﬁ rst - in - class targets . In addition to being used as possible clinical treatments , PROTAC is an ef ﬁ cient protein knockdown tool that can directly control protein levels without gene editing operations . It can be used as a useful supplement to existing genetic research tools and provide possible answers to many fundamental biological questions . With the in - depth understanding of the mechanism of PROTAC and its great potential in biological research and disease treatment , more and more researchers have begun to pay attention to this ﬁ eld , and more targets have been proven to be degradable by PROTAC molecules . In 2019 , we wrote a review of PROTACs in this journal , 6 summarizing that there were about 40 proteins that could be degraded at that time . According to the latest statistics in December 2021 , the reported PROTAC targets have reached more than 130 ( Fig . 2c ) . The number of degradable targets reported in 2020 – 2021 ( about 90 ) has completely exceeded the total amount of the previous 18 years , indicating that the era of protein degradation has arrived . In the reported studies , researchers are more inclined to choose kinases as the targets of protein degradation . According to incomplete statistics , about 54 kinases can be degraded by different degraders based on the PROTAC technology , accounting Received : 18 January 2022 Revised : 25 March 2022 Accepted : 12 April 2022 1 Ministry of Education ( MOE ) Key Laboratory of Protein Sciences , School of Pharmaceutical Sciences , MOE Key Laboratory of Bioorganic Phosphorus Chemistry & Chemical Biology , Tsinghua University , 100084 Beijing , P .

The main reason is that most kinases have known and effective inhibitors or ligands , which can be easily modi ﬁ ed to connect linkers and maintain suf ﬁ cient binding af ﬁ nity . In addition , the kinase has a deep binding pocket , which can promote the binding of PROTACs , thereby inducing the interaction between the kinase and the E3 ligase , and then ubiquitinating and ﬁ nally degrading the kinase . Moreover , although the kinase protein has a high degree of homology , PROTAC can selectively degrade different subtypes of kinases and can even be developed from nonselective inhibitors . How is the selectivity achieved by PROTAC ? Nonselective inhibitors will target the highly conserved ATP - binding pocket to exert their inhibitory effects . As is known , the residues in the ATP - binding pocket of different subtypes of kinases are highly similar , which usually results in poor selectivity for these inhibitors . When nonselective inhibitors serve as POI ligands for PROTACs , not only the protein ligands can recognize the corresponding kinases , but the degraders can induce speci ﬁ c protein – protein interaction between POI and E3 ligase to form a ternary complex . The two - step recognition mechanisms can lead to selectively degradation of targets . There are 518 kinds of kinases that have been discovered so far , which are involved in a variety of physiological regulatory processes such as cell survival , proliferation , differentiation , apoptosis , and metabolism . 7 These kinases have been divided into nine categories based on their structure and function , namely , tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) , TKL kinases ( TKLs ) , STE kinases ( STEs ) , CAMK kinases ( CAMKs ) , and AGC kinases ( AGCs ) ) , CMGC kinase group ( CMGCs ) , atypical protein kinase group ( atypical ) , CK1 kinase group , and other groups ( others ) . According to the classi ﬁ cation of the human kinase pro ﬁ le , we have marked the kinases that can be degraded as degradable kinases ( Fig . 3 ) . In the “ degradable ” kinase table , according to the classi ﬁ cation method of the kinase pro ﬁ le , it was noticed that only CK1 and CAMK have no reported PROTACs . The ﬁ rst and second targets are RTKs and CMGCs , with 19 ( 35 . 2 % ) and 14 ( 25 . 9 % ) targets , respectively , accounting for more than half of the total kinases ( Fig . 2d ) . Based on the kinases marked in the human kinase map , we have compiled the current “ list of human ‘ degradable ’ kinases based on PROTAC ” . We believe that more and more kinases will be degraded by PROTAC technology in the future . In addition , we look forward to the joint efforts of scientists all over the world to Fig . 1 The mechanism of PROTAC - mediated protein degradation Fig . 2 The researches on PROTAC from 2001 to 2021 . a The publications on PROTACs from 2001 to 2021 . b The structure of ARV - 110 and ARV - 471 . c The comparison of PROTAC targets on different diseases between 2001 – 2019 and 2001 – 2021 . d Classi ﬁ cation and percentage of degradable kinases PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 2 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 achieve the goal of ‘ each protein has a corresponding small - molecule degrader ’ in the future . In the past 2 years , the ﬁ eld of protein degradation has seen a rapid development and there has been many new literatures and technologies about not only PROTAC , but also molecular glue , LYTACs , AUTACs , ATTECs , RIBOTACs , PhosTACs , etc . A number of excellent reviews 8 – 13 have been published to discuss these areas and progress . Due to space limitations , we will focus on the discussion about PROTAC degradation technology in this article over the period of 2020 – 2021 . In the following pages , we will introduce the advances of PROTACs in disease ﬁ elds , other PROTACs technologies , and the clinical progress of PROTACs . In different disease ﬁ elds , cancers currently account for the largest part of the research on small - molecule degraders . We will generally introduce them in different sub - ﬁ elds such as signaling pathways , transcriptional regulation , and cell cycle , etc . At the end of this paper , a brief summary and perspectives will be given . PROTACS TARGETING CANCER - RELATED TARGETS MAPK / ERK signaling pathway - related proteins AR . Androgen receptor ( AR ) is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily , which plays a vital role in the maintenance of male secondary sexual characteristics and the development of the prostate . Androgen receptor disorder is the main cause of prostate cancer . Metastatic castration - resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) remains incurable and lethal . A number of AR antagonists have been developed to treat advanced prostate cancer , such as Enzalutamide , Apalutamide , and Daroluta - mide . 14 Unfortunately , patients with these AR antagonists ultimately developed drug resistance . Most tumors are resistant to AR antagonists due to AR signaling continue to function and drive tumor growth and progression . 15 There is an urgent need to develop new treatment strategies to treat prostate cancer , especially metastatic castration refractory prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) . Wang group has been committed to the development of AR degraders . Since 2019 , they have reported a number of high - ef ﬁ ciency AR degraders by mainly using AR antagonists as AR ligands and linking them with different E3 ligands such as VHL or CRBN to obtain different degraders . In the subsequent optimiza - tion process , they respectively modi ﬁ ed the AR ligands , E3 ligands , linkers and achieved good results . In 2019 , they ﬁ rst reported the degrader 1 ( ARD - 69 , Fig . 4 ) , 16 a high - ef ﬁ ciency degrader obtained by connecting an AR ligand to VHL , could ef ﬁ ciently induce the degradation of AR protein in LNCaP cells , VCaP cells , and 22Rv1 AR + cells . The DC 50 were 0 . 86 nM , 0 . 76 nM , and 10 . 4 nM , respectively . It could also effectively reduce the level of AR protein in mouse xenograft tumor tissues and had a strong inhibitory activity in AR + prostate cancer cell lines . Subsequently , they optimized the VHL ligand and obtained the degraders 2 ( ARD - 61 , Fig . 4 ) 17 and 3 ( ARD - 266 , Fig . 4 ) 18 based on ARD - 69 . They found that the AR degradation activities of these two degraders were slight worse than that of ARD - 69 in LNCaP cells and VCaP cells . But they could effectively induce the degradation of AR in other AR + breast cancer cell lines . Also , they were more effective than Enzalutamide in inhibiting cell growth and inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis . In 2021 , they used CRBN ligand to replace the VHL ligand and obtained the degrader 4 ( ARD - 2128 , Fig . 4 ) , 19 which achieved 67 % oral bioavailability in mice . Oral administration of 4 ( ARD - Fig . 3 The list of human “ degradable ” kinases based on PROTAC PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 3 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 2128 ) could effectively induce degradation of AR protein and effectively inhibit the growth of tumors in mice . This study demonstrated the possibility of developing an orally active AR degrader for the treatment of prostate cancer . In order to improve its degradation activity , they further optimized and reduced the molecule weight and obtained the degrader 5 ( ARD - 2585 , Fig . 4 ) . 20 They found that the new degrader 5 ( ARD - 2585 ) had a signi ﬁ cant increase in the degradation activity of AR in LNCaP cells and VCaP cells with the DC 50 of 0 . 1 nM and 0 . 04 nM , respectively , also it could effectively inhibit cell growth in those cell lines with the IC 50 values of 1 . 5 nM and 16 . 2 nM , respectively . Moreover , it achieved excellent pharmacokinetics and 51 % oral bioavailability in mice . In 2021 , Cravatt group discovered that DCAF11 can be used as the E3 ligases for protein degradation , and reported the ligand 21 - SLF that can ef ﬁ ciently bind to DCAF11 . 21 So they synthesized an AR - targeting degrader 6 ( 21 - ARL , Fig . 4 ) based on 21 - SLF and found it could induce dose - dependent degradation of AR in normal Fig . 4 The representative PROTACs targeting AR PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 4 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 22Rv1 cells , but it could not cause changes in AR protein in DCAF11 - KO cells . The degrader 6 ( 21 - ARL ) could induce the degradation of 90 % AR protein at 10 μ M in LNCaP cells . These data indicated that the electrophilic PROTAC ( PROTAC that operate by covalent adduction of E3 ligases ) combined with DCAF11 can promote the degradation of AR protein in human cells . Subsequently , Hwang group reported a new series of AR degraders for the treatment of metastatic castration - resistant prostate cancer . Primarily , they utilized TD - 106 as an E3 ligase ligand , a novel CRBN ligand identi ﬁ ed in their previous studies . 22 Among all the AR degraders , the representative degrader 7 ( TD - 802 , Fig . 4 ) could effectively induce the degradation of AR protein with DC 50 of 12 . 5 nM and the D max of 93 % in LNCaP prostate cancer cells . 23 In addition , the degrader 7 ( TD - 802 ) showed good liver microsomal stability and pharmacokinetic properties in vivo . In order to ﬁ nd PROTACs with lower toxicity and better binding af ﬁ nity than before , Wang group designed and synthesized several series of AR PROTACs by using CRBN / VHL E3 ligands and AR antagonists in 2021 . 24 They tested the cell inhibition of these synthetic compounds in AR - positive VCaP cells at different concentrations , and the degrader 8 ( A031 , Fig . 4 ) could inhibit 69 . 56 % of the cell viability under 1 . 0 µM . In 2021 , another series of AR PROTACs based on Bicalutamide analogs and thalidomide were designed , synthesized , and biologi - cally evaluated by the Kim group . 25 Several novel PROTACs had their abilities to induce the degradation of AR . In particular , the degrader 9 ( Fig . 4 ) induced the degradation of AR in a dose and time - dependent manner with DC 50 of 5 . 2 µM in LNCaP cells . In addition to the above examples , Enzalutamide had also been used in the design of AR degraders . The degrader 10 ( Fig . 4 ) was reported by Skidmore group based on Enzalutamide in 2020 . 26 It was a potent degrader , whose DC 50 was 10 nM and D max was 33 % in LNCaP cells . In addition , it showed an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of prostate tumor cells . The discovery of Enzalutamide - based PROTACs were expected to overcome the drug resistance that conventional drugs bring to patients . The degrader 11 ( PAP508 , Fig . 4 ) was developed as a new type of PROTAC for AR protein by Lin group in 2020 . 27 The results showed that the degradation activities of 11 ( PAP508 ) on AR protein depended on the action of proteasome , and the degradation effect was concentration and time dependent in LNCaP and VCaP cells . Also , it could inhibit the proliferation , migration , and invasion of prostate cancer cells . AR - V7 is an AR variant with a truncated C - terminus . It has been con ﬁ rmed that AR - V7 expression was induced by ADT and was associated with prostate cancer cell resistance . Recently , Kim group used the PROTAC technology to develop the degrader 12 ( MTX - 23 , Fig . 4 ) to simultaneously target and induce the degradation of AR - V7 and AR full - length ( AR - FL ) proteins . 28 The experimental results showed that the DC 50 of degrader 12 ( MTX - 23 ) induced degradation of AR - V7 and AR - FL were 0 . 37 µM and 2 µM , respectively . The degrader 12 ( MTX - 23 ) inhibited the proliferation of prostate cancer cells , and only induced apoptosis in androgen - responsive prostate cancer cells . Also in 2021 , Ke group developed the AR degrader 13 ( A16 , Fig . 4 ) based on AR agonist RU59063 and Phthalimide . 29 They found these degraders could reduce the level of AR protein with the ranging from 6 % to 32 % at 20 µM , and the degrader 13 ( A16 ) had the best activity ( 32 % degradation at 20 µM ) on reducing the level of AR protein in LNCaP cells . In 2021 , Samajdar group designed AR - V7 protein degrader 14 ( Fig . 4 ) based on AR - DBD binder VPC - 14228 . 30 The DC 50 was 0 . 32 µM for AR - V7 protein in 22Rv1 cells and 14 was found to have modest oral bioavailability . Finally , we compared the reported AR degraders ( Table 1 ) . It was found that there were various types of AR warheads currently in AR PROTACs design , but more of them were P ﬁ zer AR antagonist derivatives , followed by Enzalutamide derivatives and other binders were less used . In terms of the selection of E3 ligases , currently CRBN and VHL were both frequently selected , and other E3 ligases were used less frequently . BRAF and BRAF V600E . RAF kinase family regulates cell prolifera - tion , growth , differentiation , and survival through the RAS – RAF – MEK – ERK signaling pathway . BRAF V600E expression has been reported in a wide variety of human cancers . 31 – 33 Small - molecule drugs targeting BRAF V600E mutation include Dabrafenib , Vemurafenib , and Encorafenib . 34 They have shown good effects in clinical application , but the generation of drug resistance limits their long - term use . These small - molecule inhibitors mainly play roles by binding to the catalytic pocket of RAF , but cannot inhibit dimerization , another key link of RAF activation , so they can not completely inhibit the activity of RAF . 35 , 36 The limitations of current RAF inhibitors provide a rationale for the exploration of alternative therapeutic strategies by employing novel inhibitor mechanisms of action . In 2019 , Gou group designed a series of BRAF degraders based on RGS and pomalidomide . 37 They found that degrader 15 ( Fig . 5 ) could induce the degradation of BRAF protein in MCF - 7 cells and it could effectively show antiproliferative activity on cancer cells by inducing apoptosis . In 2020 , Cullgen used Vemurafenib and BI882370 as ligands for BRAF V600E protein . By analyzing the binding mode of inhibitors and proteins , they designed a series of degraders and found that 16 ( Fig . 5 ) based on Vemurafenib and 17 ( Fig . 5 ) based on BI882370 had better degradation activity of BRAF V600E protein . 38 They also found that degrader 16 could induce the degradation of BRAF V600E protein at 12 nM , while degrader 17 had degradation effect at 37 nM . At the same time , experiments had also shown that the two degraders had no degradation activity to wild - type BRAF protein . Finally , they performed anti - proliferation experiments with 16 and 17 on A375 cells and HT - 29 cells , respectively . The experimental results showed that the inhibitory effect of Vemurafenib - based degrader 16 on A375 cells was worse than that of inhibitor Vemurafenib . The IC 50 in HT - 29 cells was 124 nM . And BI882370 - based degrader 17 had the same inhibitory effect on A375 cells and HT - 29 cells with IC 50 of 46 . 5 nM and 51 nM , respectively . Similarly , in 2020 , Sicheri group developed a series of novel PROTACs targeting BRAF based on different BRAF inhibitors and E3 ligands ( pomalidomide and VHL ) . 39 The most effective degrader 18 ( P4B , Fig . 5 ) induced the selective degradation of BRAF V600E but not the wild - type BRAF , although degrader 18 ( P4B ) had the same af ﬁ nity for BRAF WT and BRAF V600E .

He et al . 5 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 induced by degrader 18 ( P4B ) suppressed the MEK / ERK kinase cascade in melanoma cells and impaired cell growth in culture . In addition , the degrader 18 ( P4B ) displayed effectively BRAF V600D and BRAF G466V mutant cells . These ﬁ ndings highlighted a new approach to modulating the functions of oncogenic BRAF mutants and provided a framework to treat BRAF - dependent human cancers . Recently , Crews group developed a VHL - based degrader 19 ( SJF - 0628 , Fig . 5 ) and negative control degrader 20 ( SJF - 0661 , Fig . 5 ) by coupling Vemurafenib to VHL through a rigid piperazine linker . 40 They found the degrader 19 ( SJF - 0628 ) could induce the degrada - tion of BRAF V600E protein in a variety of cell lines but did not induce the degradation of BRAF WT protein . In SK - MEL - 28 cells , the DC 50 to BRAF V600E was 6 . 8 nM and the D max exceeded 95 % . It could not only induce the degradation of BRAF V600E , but also induce the degradation of a variety of BRAF mutants in a variety of cell lines , including BRAF - p61 V600E , BRAF G469A , BRAF G466V , and so on . Subsequently , they tested the inhibitory effect of the degrader 19 ( SJF - 0628 ) on tumor cells . They found that in SK - MEL - 28 cells ( BRAF V600E ) the EC 50 of the degrader 19 ( SJF - 0628 ) was 37 nM . In SK - MEL - 239 C4 cells ( BRAF - p61 V600E ) , the EC 50 was 218 nM . In SK - MEL 246 cells ( BRAF G469A ) , the EC 50 was 45 nM . eEF2K . eEF2K ( eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase ) is known as Calmodulin - dependent kinase III ( CaM kinase III ) . eEF2K can phosphorylate its only intracellular substrate protein eEF2 and inhibit the peptide - chain extension stage during protein synthesis , and reduce the consumption of amino acids and energy so that the cell can survive under metabolic stress . 41 , 42 The expression and activity of eEF2K in some tumor cells can affect the proliferation , migration , invasion , and other physiological pro - cesses 43 – 46 But eEF2K shows different effects in different tumor cells . However , the eEF2K inhibitors have not achieved the expected effect in cancer treatment . In 2021 , Ouyang group analyzed the binding mode of eEF2K inhibitor A484954 and eEF2K protein , and obtained a series of degraders by linking it to different E3 ligase ligands . 47 Western blotting experiments determined that the degrader 21 ( Fig . 6 ) had the best eEF2K degradation activity in MDA - MB - 231 cells , and the degradation activity Dr value was as high as 56 . 7 % . It was also found that the degrader could induce apoptosis in MDA - MB - 231 cells . EGFR . EGFR , a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER ) family , is a glycoprotein belonging to tyrosine kinase - type receptor , which contains three regions : extracellular ligand - binding region , transmembrane region , and intracellular kinase region . As ligands , EGF and TGF α can activate EGFR to cause dimerization and guide the phosphorylation of downstream proteins , including MAPK , AKT and JNK pathways . Studies have shown that EGFR is over - expressed and abnormally expressed in many solid tumors and is associated with cell proliferation , angiogenesis , tumor invasion and tumor metastasis . 48 Among them , non - small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , one of the most aggressive cancers , is closely related to aberrant EGFR signaling . 49 Although three generations of small - molecule EGFR inhibitors have been approved by FDA for the treatment of NSCLC Fig . 5 The representative PROTACs targeting BRAF and BRAF V600E Fig . 6 The representative PROTAC targeting eEF2K PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 6 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 patients , drug resistance resulting from continuously heterogeneous mutations ( EGFR C797S ) remains a problem that inhibitors cannot overcome . 50 In 2019 , Jin group designed a new class of EGFR PTOACs based on Ge ﬁ tinib and different E3 ligands . 51 The degrader 22 ( MS39 , Fig . 7 ) and degrader 23 ( MS154 , Fig . 7 ) which were based on VHL and CRBN potently induced the selective degradation of EGFR mutants but not EGFR WT and inhibited lung cancer cells proliferation . In HCC - 827 ( EGFR e19d ) cells and H3255 ( EGFR L858R ) cells , both the degrader 22 ( MS39 ) and degrader 23 ( MS154 ) could ef ﬁ ciently induce the degradation of mutant EGFR proteins , with DC 50 of 5 . 0 nM , 3 . 3 nM , and 11 nM , 25 nM , respectively . While EGFR could not be degraded in OVCAR8 ( WT ) cells and H1299 ( WT ) cells , indicating that the degrader 22 ( MS39 ) and degrader 23 ( MS154 ) had selective degradation activity against mutant EGFR . In addition , degrader 22 ( MS39 ) had suf ﬁ cient in vivo PK properties and was suitable for in vivo ef ﬁ cacy studies . At the same time , a new class of EGFR PROTACs based on Osimertinib and lenalidomide was disclosed by Zhang group in 2020 . 52 The degrader 24 ( Fig . 7 ) could effectively induce degradation EGFR Del19 with a DC 50 of 161 nM and D max value of 68 % in PC9 cells . The degrader 24 had good antiproliferative activity against a variety of EGFR mutant cells , such as PC9 ( EGFR Del19 ) cells , HCC - 827 ( EGFR Del19 ) cells , and H1957 ( EGFR L858R / T790M ) cells , with IC 50 of 413 nM , 1 . 34 µM , Table 2 .

In addition , apoptosis and G0 / G1 phase arrestation of PC9 cells was signi ﬁ cantly induced by the degrader 24 unsurprisingly . In 2020 , Zhou group also reported other EGFR degrader based on Ge ﬁ tinib and VHL . 53 They found that the degrader 25 ( Fig . 7 ) could not only induce the degradation of EGFR L858R protein , but also inhibit PD - L1 and IDO1 activities . The degrader 25 also signi ﬁ cantly inhibited the growth of H3255 cells and enhanced the antitumor immune response of NSCLC . In 2020 , Zhang group published two works on EGFR PROTACs . In the ﬁ rst work , they developed EGFR degraders based on an inhibitor with pyrido [ 3 , 4 - d ] pyrimidine moiety , which was a fourth - generation EGFR - TKI that displayed potent inhibitory activity against EGFR L858R and EGFR L858R / T790M / C797S . The promising degrader 26 ( Fig . 7 ) and degrader 27 ( Fig . 7 ) induced degradation of EGFR in HCC - 827 ( EGFR e19d ) cells with the DC 50 values of 45 . 2 nM and 34 . 8 nM , respectively . 54 It was found that the apoptosis and the G1 phase arrestation of HCC - 827 cells were signi ﬁ cantly induced by the two degraders . In another work , they conjugated a purine - containing derivative which was discovered as a highly potent EGFR - TKI with lenalidomide and VHL ligand to obtained a PROTAC library . 55 The most potent degrader 28 ( P3 , Fig . 7 ) effectively induced the degradation of mutant EGFR with a DC 50 of 0 . 51 nM , D max of 80 . 4 % and DC 50 of 126nM , Dmax of 90 . 3 % in HCC - 827 ( EGFR e19d ) cells and H1975 ( EGFR L858R / T790M ) cells , respectively . The degrader 28 ( P3 ) also showed signi ﬁ cant antiproliferative activity on HCC - 827 ( EGFR e19d ) cells and H1975 ( EGFR L858R / T790M ) cells with IC 50 of 0 . 76nM and 203 nM . In addition , it also induced cell apoptosis and arrested cell cycle . In 2020 , Ding group also reported PROTACs targeting EGFR L858R / T790M based on a novel selective EGFR L858R / T790M inhibitor XTF - 262 , which was more than 100 folds selectivity over the wild - type EGFR and a panel of 465 kinases . 56 Four E3 ligases ( VHL , CRBN , MDM2 , and cIAP1 ) were utilized for design of PROTACs . The promising degrader 29 ( Fig . 7 ) with a VHL ligand effectively induced the degradation of Fig . 9 The representative PROTACs targeting ER Fig . 8 The representative PROTACs targeting eIF4E PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 8 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 EGFR L858R / T790M with DC 50 value of 5 . 9nM and showed signi ﬁ cant antiproliferative activity on H1975 ( EGFR L858R / T790M ) cells with IC 50 of 506 nM . In 2021 , Jiang group developed two highly selective and functional EGFR - targeting PROTAC 30 ( SIAIS125 , Fig . 7 ) and 31 ( SIAIS126 , Fig . 7 ) based on Canertinib and CRBN ligand . 57 Interestingly , they induced sustaining and selective degradation of EGFR L858R / T790M in H1975 cells and EGFR e19d in PC9 cells rather than EGFRE e19d / T790M in PC9Brca1 cells and EGFR WT in A549 cells , which led to the selective growth inhibition of EGFR mutant lung cancer cells instead of normal cells or A549 cells . Surprisingly , mechanistic studies showed that PROTAC - induced EGFR degrada - tion acted through both ubiquitin – proteasome system and ubiquitin - autophagy - lysosome system . They also proved that elevated autophagy activities enhanced EGFR degradation and cell apoptosis induced by PROTACs . Finally , we compared the reported EGFR degraders ( Table 2 ) . It was found that there were various types of EGFR warheads currently in EGFR PROTACs design , but more of them were already marketed drugs , followed by reported inhibitors . In the selection of E3 ligases , CRBN and VHL were currently used , and other E3 ligases were not used in EGFR degraders . eIF4E . eIF4E ( Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E ) is a cap - binding protein that can speci ﬁ cally recognize the cap structure at the 5 ’ - end of mRNA . 58 It plays an important role in the initiation of eukaryotic translation . 59 Studies have found that the overexpression of eIF4E is related to cancer and other diseases , and eIF4E levels are elevated in 30 % of cancers , so eIF4E has become an attractive target for drug discovery . 60 In 2021 , Arthanari group developed a new type of eIF4E inhibitor i4EG - BiP based on the crystal structure and proved that the inhibitor could inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells . 61 Then they designed and synthesized a series of eIF4E degraders based on the binding mode of i4EG - BiP and eIF4E . 62 Through the degradation activity test , it was found that the degrader 32 ( d4E - 4 , Fig . 8 ) and the degrader 33 ( d4E - 6 , Fig . 8 ) showed certain eIF4E degradation activity . When the drug concentrations were 10 µM , the obvious downregulation of eIF4E could be observed after 0 . 5 h of drug treatment . ER . Estrogen receptors include two types : type I receptors are the classical nuclear receptors , including ER α and ER β , which are located in the nucleus and mediate the genotype effect of estrogen . Type II receptors are membranous receptors , including membranous components of classical nuclear receptors and GPER1 ( GPR30 ) , Gaq - ER , and ER - X , which belong to the G - protein - coupled receptor family . They mediate rapid non - genotypic effects and perform indirect transcriptional regulatory functions through the second messenger system . The distribution of these two types of receptors is tissue and cell - speci ﬁ c and they are involved in the regulation of various functions such as reproduction , learning , memory , cognition , and so on . It is well - known that the overexpression of estrogen receptor α ( ER α ) may lead to ER - positive breast cancer , which accounts for 70 % of breast cancer . 63 , 64 Approved endocrine therapies include aromatase inhibitors ( AIs ) such as Letrozole , selective ER modulators ( SERMs ) such as Tamoxifen , and selective ER degrader ( SERDs ) such as Fulvestrant . But the long - term use of SERMs is prone to lead to drug resistance and Fulvestrant is limited by poor solubility and low oral bioavailability . 65 , 66 The emergence of PROTACs provides a new method for the development of drugs targeting ER α . Since July 2021 , P ﬁ zer and Arvinas have been collaborating to advance the study of oral PROTAC 34 ( ARV - 471 , Fig . 9 ) targeting estrogen receptors ( ER ) . 5 The PROTAC 34 ( ARV - 471 ) was the ﬁ rst degrader developed by Arvinas in 2018 and entered clinical studies for ER + / HER2 − , locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer . In December 2020 , a phase I clinical study was completed and the results showed that the PROTAC 34 ( ARV - 471 ) induced degrada - tion of ER potently with encouraging clinical ef ﬁ cacy and tolerability . Another two trials of 34 ( ARV - 471 ) were scheduled to start this year . With the advancement of 34 ( ARV - 471 ) research , PROTACs could not only provide tools for scienti ﬁ c research but also serve as an important approach for drug development . PROTACs / SNIPERs , the peptide - based target protein - degradation inducers , tend to have low cell penetrability and poor intracellular stability as drawbacks . In 2019 , Qian group attempted to improve stability and cell penetration by using a lactam cyclic peptide as ER α binding ligand . 67 The optimized degrader 35 ( I - 6 , Fig . 9 ) induced obvious ER α degradation and inhibited MCF - 7 cell growth with an IC 50 of 9 . 7 µM . In 2019 , Rae group reported a new ER degrader 36 ( ERD - 148 , Fig . 9 ) . 68 They found that in wild - type MCF - 7 and ER α LBD mutant cells , the degrader 36 ( ERD - 148 ) showed strong inhibitory activity , the IC 50 values in MCF - 7 , cY537S , and cD538G cells were 0 . 8 nM , 10 . 5 nM , and 6 . 1 nM , respectively . At the same time , the degrader 36 ( ERD - 148 ) could not only induce the degradation of wild - type ER α but also showed strong degradation activity against Y537S and D538G mutant ER α . In 2020 , Tang group developed a two - stage strategy for PROTACs screening . 69 In stage one , the ER α ligands with a hydrazide functional group reacted with E3 ligase ligands with a terminal aldehyde group in DMSO solution to form a more than 100 compounds library . Then the ELISA screening was conducted without further puri ﬁ cation . Among them , the degrader A3 was screened out with DC 50 of 10 nM Fig . 10 The representative PROTAC targeting FGFR1 / 2 Fig . 11 The representative PROTACs targeting IGF - 1R and Src PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 9 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 and D max of 95 % . Then they transformed the degrader A3 to a more stable degrader 37 ( AM - A3 , Fig . 30 ) with better degradation activity ( DC 50 = 1 . 1 nM , D max = 98 % ) and cell growth inhibition ( IC 50 = 13 . 2 nM , I max = 69 % ) in MCF - 7 . In 2021 , X - Chem developed a novel class of PROTACs based on a new ER α binder which was based on DNA - encoded chemical library screening . 70 They screened 120 billion DNA - encoded molecules and found the best warhead to ER α , then they conjugated the warhead to many kinds of E3 ligase ligands by click reaction to obtain some novel PROTACs . They found the degrader 38 ( Fig . 9 ) could induce the degradation of ER α with DC 50 of 37 nM and inhibit MCF - 7 cells growth with GI 50 of 165 nM , and effectively inhibited ER + MCF - 7 tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model of breast cancer . AstraZeneca also announced its degraders that targeted the degradation of ER α . 71 Their study found that the af ﬁ nity of degrader 39 ( Fig . 9 ) for ER α protein was as high as 0 . 8 nM . In MCF - 7 cells , it had a strong degradation activity for ER α protein , and the DC 50 was 0 . 3 nM . Salem group reported the degrader 40 ( UI - EP002 , Fig . 9 ) could effectively induce the degradation of ER α , ER β , and GPER . 72 UI - EP002 would induce degradation of the plasma membrane and intracellular GPER and nuclear ERs , but could not affect others proteins lacking the estrogen targeting domain . The target speci ﬁ city was further proved in human MCF - 7 cells , which could effectively induce degradation of ER α , ER β and GPER without affecting the PRs . The degrader 40 ( UI - EP002 ) induced cytotoxicity and G2 / M cell cycle arrest in MCF - 7 breast cancer and human SKBR3 ( ER α - ER β - GPER + ) breast cancer cells but did not induce proliferation inhibition of MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells . FGFR1 / 2 . FGFR ( ﬁ broblast growth factor receptor ) belongs to the tyrosine receptor kinase ( TRK ) family in the human genome , including FGFR1 , FGFR2 , FGFR3 , and FGFR4 subtypes . The signaling pathways mediated by FGFR are required for normal cell growth and differentiation , and they are involved in physiological processes , such as neovascularization , cell prolif - eration , and migration , regulation of organ development , and wound healing . 73 – 75 However , when FGFR is mutated or overexpressed , it will cause excessive activation of the FGFR signaling pathway and induce normal cell canceration . There are FGFR aberrations in almost all the detected malignant tumors , such as urothelial carcinoma , bile duct carcinoma , breast carcinoma , endometrial carcinoma , squamous carcinoma and so on . 76 – 78 A number of companies are engaged in the research and development of FGFRs inhibitors . Although 2 FGFR inhibitors have been approved , they are all multi - target inhibitors . 79 , 80 The FGFR subtype - selective inhibitors are both in the clinical development stage . 81 In 2021 , Gray group synthesized several glutarimide - based CRBN - targeting degraders with various linkers based on FGFR inhibitor BGJ398 . 82 Through binding af ﬁ nity tests and protein - degradation experiments , it was found that the PROTACs based on BGJ398 could degrade TEL - FGFR2 in Ba / F3 cells , while the full - length FGFR2 was poorly degraded in Kato III cells . There - fore , they used VHL ligands to replace CRBN and found the degrader 41 ( DGY - 09 – 192 , Fig . 10 ) based on BGJ398 and VHL ligands had nanomolar degradation activity for both wild - type and fusion - mutant FGFR2 proteins . Furthermore , the degrader 41 ( DGY - 09 - 192 ) showed highly selective degradation of FGFR1 and 2 , as well as full - length FGFR2 or FGFR2 fusion proteins , despite retaining equivalent biochemical inhibition of all four FGFR isoform proteins . However , the degrader 41 ( DGY - 09 - 192 ) also had some limitations that need to be overcome . For example , the degrader 41 ( DGY - 09 - 192 ) showed no improve - ment in antiproliferative activity compared to the inhibitor BGJ398 and did not overcome BGJ398 - induced point muta - tions in the FGFR protein . Fig . 12 The representative PROTACs targeting KRAS G12C PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 10 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 IGF - 1R and Src . Insulin - like growth factor 1 receptor ( IGF - 1R ) is a membrane receptor tyrosine kinase . Overexpression of IGF - 1R plays a key role in the proliferation , transformation , and survival of various cancer cells , such as breast cancer , lung cancer , prostate cancer , and so on . 83 The anti - apoptotic effect of IGF - 1R can cause tumor cells to develop resistance to commonly used chemother - apy drugs or radiotherapy drugs . The protein encoded by the Src gene belongs to the Src family of kinases ( SFKs ) , which consists of 9 members , namely Src , Lyn , Fyn , Lck , Hck , Fgr , Blk , Yrk , and Yes . Among them , Src is currently the most known member . 84 It is a non - receptor tyrosine kinase , which is related to the survival and drug resistance of cancer cells . At present , studies have shown that the activation of Src is related to the drug resistance of IGF - 1R inhibitors . Therefore , the dual inhibitory effect of IGF - 1R and Src may be a feasible way to develop new antitumor drugs to overcome drug resistance . 85 In 2020 , Lee group designed a variety of degraders based on different types of IGF - 1R inhibitors and CRBN . 86 The ligands for the targeted protein included IGF - 1R / Src dual - target inhibitors . During the screening process , it was found that the degraders 42 ( CPR3 , Fig . 11 ) and 43 ( CPR4 , Fig . 11 ) based on N 2 - phenyl - N 4 - ( 1H - pyrazol - 3 - yl ) pyrimidine - 2 , 4 - diamine had IGF - 1R / Src dual - target degrada - tion activity . In MCF - 7 and A549 cells , the obvious degradation of IGF - 1R and Src could be observed at the concentration of 5 µM . Although the degradation effect was poor , it showed obvious antiproliferative activity on MCF - 7 and A549 cells , and the IC 50 were 3 . 3 µM , 2 . 7 µM and 4 . 2 µM , 7 . 6 µM , respectively . KRAS G12C . KRAS is a mouse sarcoma virus oncogene . There are three ras genes related to human cancer : HRAS , KRAS , and NRAS , which are located on chromosomes 11 , 12 , and 1 , respectively . Among them , KRAS has the greatest impact on cancer because it serves as a molecular switch which cycles between an inactive ( GDP - bound “ off ” ) state and an active ( GTP - bound “ on ” ) state . 87 , 88 It controls the pathways that regulate cell growth under normal conditions , when KRAS gene is mutated to be permanently activated , normal RAS protein can not be produced which leads to abnormal cell proliferation and cancerization . KRAS is one of the most frequently mutated oncogenes , high - frequency mutations ( such as G12A , G12C , G12D , G12S , G12V , G13C , G13D ) and some low - frequency mutations can activate KRAS . 89 KRAS has mutations in a variety of cancers , among which pancreatic cancer has a mutation rate of 90 % , colon cancer and lung cancer ( mainly non - small cell lung cancer ) have mutation rates of 30 – 50 % and 19 % , and cholangiocarcinoma accounts for about 26 % . Since the KRAS protein does not have a suitable binding pocket for small inhibitors , the development of small inhibitors targeting KRAS has not made a breakthrough for a long time . However , people have been paying attention to the G12C mutation and have developed some covalent inhibitors . There have been many KRAS G12C inhibitors were in clinical researches , but the results also showed that some patients have already developed drug resistance . 90 PROTACs which had the advantages of overcoming drug resistance and targeting undruggable targets provide a complementary approach to cancer treatment . In 2019 , Arvinas announced its patent for using PROTAC technology to induce the degradation of KRAS G12C . They designed a large number of KRAS G12C degraders based on ARS - 1620 derivatives and different E3 ligase ligands . 91 They found that degraders 44 ( Fig . 12 ) and 45 ( Fig . 12 ) had good KRAS G12C protein - degradation activity through degradation activity screening . In NCI - H2030 cells , the degradation of KRAS G12C was less than 25 % when the drug concentration was 300 nM , but the degradation activity was signi ﬁ cantly enhanced as the concentration increased . The degradation activity was higher than 50 % when the concentration was 1 µM . The results proved that the KRAS G12C could also be induced degradation by PROTAC technology , which brought hope for the treatment of related diseases . Fig . 14 The representative PROTAC targeting Myc Fig . 13 The representative PROTACs targeting MEK PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 11 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 In 2020 , Gray group also reported the PROTAC targeting KRAS G12C . The CRBN ligands were tethered to covalent quinazoline - based ligand ARS - 1620 at the 2 - position on the quinazoline to construct a degrader library . 92 Then KRAS G12C degradation was screened by a ﬂ uorescent - activated cell sorting ( FACS ) - based assay in a high - throughput manner . But it was regrettable that these compounds only induced the degradation of an arti ﬁ cial GFP - KRAS G12C fusion protein but not endogenous KARS G12C , which might be due to the inability of the lead degrader to effectively poly - ubiquitinate endogenous KRAS G12C . However , the degrader 46 ( XY - 4 - 88 , Fig . 12 ) showed good antiproliferative activity in different tumor cells , such as H358 cells ( IC 50 = 0 . 51 µM ) , MiaPaCa2 cells ( IC 50 = 4 . 14 µM ) and MiaPaCa2 ( GILA ) cells ( IC 50 = 0 . 51 µM ) . Nevertheless , they developed a series of critical assays for in vitro activity evaluation and laid the foundation for the emergence of subsequent KARS PROTACs . In 2020 , Crews group also reported the ﬁ rst - in - class endogenous KRAS G12C degraders based on covalent KRAS inhibitor MRTX849 and VHL ligand . 93 A variety of linkers were introduced at N - methyl moiety of the pyrrolidine to generate a PROTAC library . The degrader 47 ( LC - 2 , Fig . 12 ) was identi ﬁ ed as the most potent KRAS G12C degrader through screening , which induced rapid and sustained degradation of endogenous KRAS G12C with D max of 80 % and DC 50 of 0 . 59 µM in NCI - H2030 cells . In addition , they have also tested the degradation activity of the degrader 47 ( LC - 2 ) in a variety of cells and found that it could ef ﬁ ciently induce the degradation of KRAS G12C protein in different cells . It also modulated downstream ERK signaling in homozygous and heterozygous KRAS - mutant cell lines . Recently , Chen group designed and synthesized KRAS G12C degraders based on KRas G12C - IN - 3 and pomalidomide . 94 They found the degrader 48 ( KP - 14 , Fig . 12 ) showed the best KRAS G12C degradation activity in NCI - H358 cells with a DC 50 of 1 . 25 μ M . Mechanism experiments have proved that degrader 48 ( KP - 14 ) selectively induced the degradation of KRAS G12C through the protein – ubiquitin system , but could not induce the degradation of other KRAS mutants such as G13D . In addition , the degrader 48 ( KP - 14 ) exhibited effective antiproliferative activity and inhibited the formation of tumor colonies in NCI - H358 cells . Also , based on the structure of LC - 2 , Lu group replaced its vinyl moiety to obtain a series of KRAS G12C degraders . 95 They found that degrader 49 ( YF135 , Fig . 12 ) had the best degradation activity in H358 and H23 cells . It could induce the degradation of KRAS G12C protein with DC 50 of 3 . 61 µM and 4 . 53 µM , respectively . At the same time , the degrader also showed good antiproliferative activity in these two tumor cells , and the IC 50 were 153 . 9 and 243 . 9 nM , respectively . The degrader 49 ( YF135 ) was the ﬁ rst reversible covalent PROTAC that was capable of recruiting VHL - mediated proteasomal to induce the degradation of KRAS G12C . MEK . MAP kinase kinase or mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MEK ) is an important signal molecule in Ras – RAF - ME - ERK pathway . MEK1 and MEK2 are two subtypes of the MEK family . MEK1 and MEK2 activate ERK in cell proliferation , apoptosis , cell differentiation and play an important role in tumorigenesis . Jin group published two articles on MEK degraders in 2019 and 2020 . In 2019 , they synthesized the MEK degraders based on the Fig . 16 The representative PROTACs targeting PDE δ Fig . 17 The representative PROTACs targeting SHP2 Fig . 15 The representative PROTACs targeting p38 PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 12 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 structure of non - ATP competitive MEK inhibitor PD0325901 and VHL . They found that the degrader 50 ( MS432 , Fig . 13 ) showed the strongest degradation activity , but it was not selective for MEK1 and MEK2 . 96 In HT - 29 cells , the degradation activity DC 50 of MEK1 and MEK2 were 31 nM and 17 nM , and the inhibitory activity of GI 50 was 130 nM . In SK - MEL - 28 cells , the DC 50 of MEK1 and MEK2 were 31 nM and 9 . 3 nM , and the inhibitory activity GI 50 was 83 nM . It could also inhibit ERK phosphorylation in cells , and could inhibit the proliferation of colorectal cancer and melanoma cells more effectively than the negative control . In 2020 , they also developed the other MEK degraders based on PD0325901 and different E3 ligases ligands . They obtained VHL - based degraders 51 ( MS928 , Fig . 13 ) , 52 ( MS934 , Fig . 13 ) , and CRBN - based degrader 53 ( MS910 , Fig . 13 ) , 97 and they found these degraders could effectively induce the degradation of MEK1 / 2 through the ubiquitin – proteasome system , but they were not selective for MEK1 and MEK2 . These degraders also inhibited downstream signal transduction and cancer cell proliferation . The degradation activities and inhibitory activities of VHL ligand - based degraders 51 ( MS928 ) and 52 ( MS934 ) in HT - 29 cells and SK - MEL - 28 cells were equivalent to the degrader 50 ( MS432 ) , but the CRBN - based degrader 53 ( MS910 ) was signi ﬁ cantly weaker than the degrader 50 ( MS432 ) . In 2020 , Perry group reported the MEK1 / 2 degrader based on allosteric MEK inhibitor Refametinib derivative and VHL . 98 They found the degrader 54 ( Fig . 13 ) had the ef ﬁ cacy of inducing the degradation of MEK1 / 2 at 10 µM . The degrader 54 had a stronger effect on cell proliferation than inhibitor and showed a better ef ﬁ cacy of suppression of ERK1 / 2 phosphorylation and IL - 6 secretion . Myc . MYC is a broadly acting transcription factor that regulates cell differentiation and proliferation through multiple mechan - isms . 99 MYC gene is currently the most studied nuclear protein carcinoid gene , including C - MYC , N - MYC , L - MYC , and R - MYC . C - MYC is one of the most common activated proto - oncogenes . 100 Cancers regulated by C - MYC account for about 20 % of human cancers . 101 However , because it is extremely dif ﬁ cult to develop drugs that directly target the MYC protein , MYC has become an “ undruggable ” target . 102 Schneider group designed and synthesized a MYC degrader based on the MYC - MAX dimerization inhibitor 10058 - F4 deriva - tive 28RH and thalidomide . 103 They found the degrader 55 ( MDEG - 541 , Fig . 14 ) could rapidly induce the degradation of MYC protein in HCT116 or PSN1 cells , and almost completely induced the degradation of MYC protein when the drug concentration was 20 µM . In addition , they also found that the degrader 55 ( MDEG - 541 ) could degrade GSPT1 and GSPT2 in a variety of cells . p38 . p38 mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) family con - sists of p38 α , p38 β , p38 γ , and p38 δ . 104 p38 α is widely expressed in almost all cell types and attributed the main function in the p38 family . p38 β expressed at a lower level and may have redundant functions with p38 α . The function of p38 α is highly dependent on cell type and environment . For example , during tumorigenesis , p38 α usually plays a tumor - suppressive role in normal epithelial cells , while in malignant cells p38 α tends to support tumor development . 105 However , currently available p38 α inhibitors have not shown the expected ef ﬁ cacy in clinical trials . In 2020 , Nebreda declared their design and synthesis of a series of novel p38 α / β degraders based on an ATP competitive inhibitor of p38 α / β PH - 797804 and thalidomide analogs . 106 The degraders 56 ( NR - 6a , Fig . 15 ) and 57 ( NR - 7h , Fig . 15 ) were the two representative degraders which could ef ﬁ ciently induce the degradation of p38 α / β without other related kinases at nanomolar concentrations in several mammalian cell lines . The degraders 56 ( NR - 6a ) and 57 ( NR - 7h ) inhibited the p38 α signaling pathway induced by stress and cytokines , which provided a useful tool to investigate function and in ﬂ uence of the p38 MAPK pathway in diseases . PDE δ . KRAS is recognized as one of the targets of cancer treatment . However , no small - molecule drug targeting KRAS has been approved . PDE δ is a shuttling factor of RAS which can prevent KRAS binding to the endomembrane and promote its diffusion in the whole cell . 107 Subsequently , KRAS is released from PDE δ by releasing factor Arl2 and transported to the plasma membrane . Several KRAS - PDE δ inhibitors with potent af ﬁ nity have been reported , such as Deltarasin , Deltazinone , and Deltasona - mide . 108 However , Arl2 induces the fast release of high - af ﬁ nity inhibitors from PDE δ and ﬁ nally reduces their antitumor ef ﬁ cacy . 109 In 2019 , Waldmann group reported the development of degraders based on PDE δ inhibitor Deltasonamide and thalido - mide . 110 The degrader 58 ( Fig . 16 ) could ef ﬁ ciently and selectively induce the degradation of PDE δ with DC 50 of 48 nM and D max of 83 . 4 % in Panc Tu - I cells . The application of the PDE δ degrader 58 increased sterol regulatory element binding protein ( SREBP ) - mediated gene expression of enzymes involved in lipid metabo - lism , resulting in elevated levels of cholesterol precursors . It demonstrated that PDE δ function played a role in the enzymatic regulation of the mevalonate pathway . Fig . 18 The representative PROTACs targeting AKT PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 13 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 In 2020 , Sheng group developed a series of potent PDE δ degraders by connecting PDE δ inhibitor Deltazinone and pomalidomide . 111 The most promising degrader 59 ( Fig . 16 ) ef ﬁ ciently induced the degradation of PDE δ with the DC 50 value of 3 . 6 μ M , and exhibited signi ﬁ cantly improved antiproliferative potency in KRAS - mutant SW480 cells . In addition , the degrader 59 also achieved signi ﬁ cant tumor growth inhibition in the SW480 xenograft model . This approach offered an effective lead degrader for the treatment of KRAS - mutant cancer . SHP2 . Src homology 2 domain - containing phosphatase 2 ( SHP2 ) belongs to protein tyrosine phosphatase family . 112 SHP2 muta - tions exist in most tumor cells . Moreover , this target has been con ﬁ rmed to be related to a variety of signaling pathways . For example , in the RAS - ERK pathway , SHP2 acts as its upstream positive regulator , which promotes cancer cell proliferation by phosphorylating ERK . Therefore , the inhibition of SHP2 can inhibit the growth of cancer cells and induce apoptosis . 113 In 2020 , Wang group developed a SHP2 degrader 60 ( SHP2 - D26 , Fig . 17 ) conjugated with the SHP2 inhibitor SHP099 and VHL ligand . 114 The degrader 60 ( SHP2 - D26 ) could induce the rapid and ef ﬁ cient degradation of SHP2 protein in KYSE520 cells ( DC 50 = 6 . 0 nM ) and MV4 ; 11 cells ( DC 50 = 2 . 6 nM ) , and was capable of reducing SHP2 protein levels by more than 95 % in cancer cells . Compared to inhibitor SHP099 , the degrader 60 ( SHP2 - D26 ) exhibited more than 30 - folds of potent inhibition to cell growth in KYSE520 and MV4 ; 11 cancer cell lines . In 2020 , Li group developed a novel SHP2 degrader 61 ( SP4 , Fig . 61 ) also conjugated with the SHP2 inhibitor SHP099 and CRBN ligand through a PEG linker . 115 The degrader 61 ( SP4 ) successfully induced the moderate degradation of SHP2 in HeLa cells with the D max about 40 % at 500 nM after 24 h of treatment . At the same years , Zhou group developed another SHP2 degrader 62 ( ZB - S - 29 , Fig . 17 ) conjugated with the potent and selective SHP2 inhibitor TNO155 and CRBN ligand . 116 The degrader 62 ( ZB - S - 29 ) effectively induced the degradation of SHP2 protein in a time and dose - dependent manner with a DC 50 of 6 . 02 nM in MV4 ; 11 cells , and induced more than 90 % SHP2 degradation at 500 nM after 24 h of treatment . Moreover , it exhibited signi ﬁ cant cell proliferation inhibition in MV4 ; 11 cells and induced apparent G1 phase arrest or apoptosis in a dose - dependent manner . Subsequently , another SHP2 degrader 63 ( R1 - 5C , Fig . 17 ) developed by conjugating RMC - 4550 with pomalidomide was reported . 117 The degrader 63 ( R1 - 5C ) exhibited highly selective SHP2 degradation with low concentration , suppressed MAPK signaling , and inhibited cancer cell growth . PI3K / Akt signaling pathway - related proteins AKT . The serine / threonine kinase AKT is a central component of the phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) signaling cascade and a key regulator of critical cellular processes , including proliferation , survival , and metabolism . Hyperactivation of AKT , due to gain - of - function mutations or ampli ﬁ cation of oncogenes ( receptor tyrosine kinases and PI3K ) or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes ( PTEN , INPP4B , and PHLPP ) , is one of the most common molecular perturbations in cancer and promotes malignant phenotypes associated with tumor initiation and progression . 118 Thus , AKT is an attractive therapeutic target . In 2020 , Toker group described a degrader 64 ( INY - 03 - 041 , Fig . 18 ) by conjugating lenalidomide and the most advanced AKT inhibitor GDC - 0068 . 119 The degrader 64 ( INY - 03 - 041 ) inhibited AKT1 , AKT2 , and AKT3 with the IC 50 values of 2 . 0 nM , 6 . 8 nM , and 3 . 5 nM , respectively , while the IC 50 values of GCD - 0068 were 5 . 0 nM , 18 . 0 nM , and 8 . 0 nM , respectively . They found degrader 64 ( INY - 03 - 041 ) could induce the degradation of AKT1 / 2 / 3 in a dose - dependent manner and the maximal degradation activity was observed at 100 nM to 250 nM . Also they found degrader 64 ( INY - 03 - 041 ) had good antiproliferative activities in different cell lines , such as ZR - 75 - 1 cells ( GR 50 = 16 nM ) . Besides , degrader 64 ( INY - 03 - 041 ) destabilized all the Fig . 19 The representative PROTACs targeting ALK PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 14 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 three AKT isoforms and reduced the downstream signaling effects even after degrader 64 ( INY - 03 - 041 ) was washed out . It suppressed cell proliferation more potently than GCD - 0068 , which indicated that it had potential therapeutic value for targeted degradation of AKT . In 2021 , Jin group also designed the AKT degraders based on the structure of GDC - 0068 , which they coupled with different VHL and pomalidomide ligands to obtain VHL - based AKT degrader 65 ( MS98 , Fig . 18 ) and CRBN - based degrader 66 ( MS170 , Fig . 18 ) . 120 They found 65 ( MS98 ) and 66 ( MS170 ) showed AKT - degradation activities on BT474 cells with DC 50 of 78 nM and 32 nM , respectively . They tested the inhibitory activity of the two degraders on different tumor cell lines , including BT474 cells , PC - 3 cells and MDA - MB - 468 cells . The results showed 65 ( MS98 ) and 66 ( MS170 ) both had inhibitory activity on these cell lines with GI 50 were at the micromolar level . However , the degradation activities and growth inhibitory activities were both weaker than 64 ( INY - 03 - 041 ) . ALK . Anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) is a tyrosine kinase of the insulin receptor ( IR ) kinase subfamily . Fusion proteins of anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) are emerging therapeutic targets for cancer and other human diseases , especially non - small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) and anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( ALCL ) . 121 , 122 So far , ﬁ ve ALK inhibitors , including Alectinib , Brigatinib , Ceritinib , Crizotinib , and Lorlatinib have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of ALK - positive NSCLC . Despite the initial response to these inhibitors , drug resistance was observed within 1 – 2 years in most patients partly due to acquired ALK - resistant mutations . 123 , 124 Hence , novel therapeutic strategies are in demand to overcome drug resistance . In 2019 , the ﬁ rst multi - headed ( several interconnected ligands for POI and E3 ubiquitin ligase ) PROTAC was developed as a gold nanoparticle ( GNP ) - based drug delivery system for delivering PROTAC to target ALK . 125 The degrader 67 ( Cer / Pom - PEG @ GNPs , Fig . 19 ) loaded with both Ceritinib and pomalidomide , and showed good stability in several media . 67 ( Cer / Pom - PEG @ GNPs ) potently decreased the levels of ALK fusion proteins in a dose and time - dependent manner . And it speci ﬁ cally inhibited the pro - liferation of NCI - H2228 cells with IC 50 of 4 . 8 µM . In comparison with small - molecule PROTACs , the new multi - headed PROTAC promoted the formation of coacervates of POIs / multi - headed PROTAC / E3 ubiquitin ligases , and POI and E3 ubiquitin ligase interacted through multidirectional ligands and a ﬂ exible linker , thereby avoiding the need for complicated structure optimization of PROTACs . In 2021 , Li group also reported a new series of ALK degraders based on Ceritinib and pomalidomide . 126 The degrader 68 ( B3 , Fig . 19 ) showed potent selective inhibitory activity to ALK ( IC 50 = 1 . 6 nM ) and could decrease the level of ALK fusion protein in H3122 cells . Meanwhile , 68 ( B3 ) showed better anticancer activity in vitro compared with Ceritinib in different cell lines Fig . 20 The representative PROTACs targeting Bcl - xl PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 15 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 and the antiproliferative activity to xenograft tumor model was acceptable . All the results demonstrated that the anticancer activities of 68 ( B3 ) in vitro and in vivo were valuable for further investigation . Apart from Ceritinib , Alectinib was also widely used in the design of ALK degraders . In 2020 and 2021 , Jiang group reported several ALK degraders based on Alectinib and lenalidomide , such as 69 ( SIAIS001 , Fig . 19 ) and 70 ( SIAIS091 , Fig . 19 ) . 127 And they found these degraders had good ALK degradation activity in SR cells as the DC 50 were 3 . 9 nM and 6 . 1 nM , and D max were 70 . 3 % and 87 . 7 % , respectively . At the same time , they also showed good anti - proliferation activity in SR cells , and the IC 50 were 0 . 9 nM and 0 . 5 nM . Subsequently , Xu group reported an ALK degrader 71 ( Fig . 19 ) also based on Alectinib . 128 The difference from Jiang group was that the E3 ligase ligand they used was pomalidomide , while Jiang group was lenalidomide . They found degrader 71 had the best ALK degradation activity , highest ALK binding af ﬁ nity and best antiproliferative activity in such ALK - dependent cell lines as H3122 cells and Karpas 299 cells , whose DC 50 were 27 . 4 nM , 116 . 5 nM and IC 50 were 62 nM , 42 nM . The degrader 71 also had no obvious cytotoxicity in ALK fusion - negative cells . More importantly , it showed obvious antitumor proliferation activity in the xenograft mouse model . Also in 2020 , Jiang group reported the ALK degrader 72 ( SIAIS117 , Fig . 19 ) , 129 which was based on Brigatinib and VHL . It could not only induce the degradation of ALK protein , but also showed obvious antiproliferative activity on SR cells and H2228 cells , and the inhibitory activity was signi ﬁ cantly better than that of the inhibitor Brigatinib . In addition , the degrader 72 ( SIAIS117 ) could also induce the degradation of ALK G1202R mutant protein in vitro so it had potential anti - proliferation activity of small cell lung cancer . Then they replaced the VHL ligand with pomalidomide on the basis of 72 ( SIAIS117 ) and obtained the degrader 73 ( SIAIS164018 , Fig . 19 ) with good degradation activity for ALK . 130 It could not only induce the degradation of the wild - type ALK protein and ALK G1202R mutant protein , and even the EGFR L858R + T790M mutant protein . The degrader 73 ( SIAIS164018 ) also had a strong inhibitory effect on the migration and invasion of a variety of tumor cells . Also , the kinase inhibition of 73 ( SIAIS164018 ) was different from that of Brigatinib and it rearranged the kinase inhibition of Brigatinib . BCL - XL . In the BCL - 2 family , overexpression of anti - apoptotic proteins including BCL - 2 , Bcl - xl , and myeloid cell 1 is a key sign of cancer partly evading apoptosis . B - cell lymphoma extra large ( Bcl - xl ) is a well - validated cancer target . 131 Inhibition of these BCL - 2 family proteins with small molecules has been widely studied as a cancer treatment strategy , resulting in the discovery of ABT - 263 ( BCL - 2 and Bcl - xl dual inhibitor ) and several selective Bcl - xl inhibitors as promising anticancer drug candidates . 132 Although these inhibitors are useful for the treatment of certain hematological malignancies , such as CLL and AML , the on - target and dose - limiting thrombocytopenia induced by Bcl - xl inhibition has limited the clinical use of these inhibitors . 133 Bcl - xl is mainly overexpressed in many solid tumor cells and leukemia cells , and its expression is highly correlated with resistance to cancer therapy . As one of the most important validated cancer targets without a safe and effective therapeu - tic , Bcl - xl needs more selective methods to inhibit its activity . E3 ligases are differentially expressed in tumor cells compared with normal tissues . Thus , a method that relies on PROTAC to induce protein degradation seems to perfectly overcome this problem . Zhou and Zheng group has been devoted to the develop - ment of high - ef ﬁ ciency Bcl - xl degraders . They used different Bcl - xl inhibitors and E3 ligands to design and synthesize a large number of different Bcl - xl degraders , and obtained some Bcl - xl degraders with good degradation activity . In 2019 , Zhou and Zheng group reported the ﬁ rst selective Bcl - xl degrader 74 ( DT2216 , Fig . 20 ) by coupling the toxicity ABT - 263 with the VHL ligand to achieve ef ﬁ cient Bcl - xl degradation . 134 The DC 50 and D max were 63 nM and 90 . 8 % in MOLT - 4 T - cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( T - ALL ) cells . Since VHL was poorly expressed in platelets , degrader 74 ( DT2216 ) was more potent against various Bcl - xl - dependent leukemia and cancer cells but considerably less toxic to platelets than ABT - 263 in vitro . In vivo , degrader 74 ( DT2216 ) , as a single drug or in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs , can effectively inhibit the growth of several xenograft tumors without causing signi ﬁ cant thrombocytopenia . These ﬁ ndings suggested that degrader 74 ( DT2216 ) had greater clinical potential than ABT - 263 or other Bcl - xl inhibitors . In addition to VHL , CRBN was also modestly expressed in platelets . Therefore , they replaced the VHL ligand with CRBN on the basis of DT2216 to obtain a series of degraders . 135 In the degradation activity test , they found that the degrader 75 ( XZ739 , Fig . 20 ) , a pomalidomide - dependent degrader to Bcl - xl , had the best degradation activity . It had a DC 50 of 2 . 5 nM for the degradation activity of Bcl - xl in MOLT - 4 T - ALL cells and had good antiproliferative activity against a variety of cells . In MOLT - 4 T - ALL cells , its antiproliferative activity was 22 - folds and the selectivity to human platelets was up to 120 - folds than that of inhibitor ABT - 263 . Both the antiproliferative activity and the selectivity to platelets were signi ﬁ cantly better than inhibitor ABT - 263 , thus showing great potential for application . Furthermore , the group also introduced IAP ligands into the degraders in 2020 . 136 They found that the degrader 76 ( Fig . 20 ) showed the best antiproliferative activity in MyLa 1929 cells with IC 50 of 62 nM and it could ef ﬁ ciently induce the degradation of Bcl - xl protein in different cell lines , such as MyLa 1929 cells , A549 cells , MDA - MB - 231 cells , SW620 cells , MeWo cells , SK - MEL - 28 cells , and CHL - 1 cells , which proved that it was feasible to replace CRBN and VHL with IAP ligands in the design of Bcl - xl degraders . Subsequently , they still used ABT - 263 and CRBN as ligands to design and synthesize the degrader 77 ( PZ15527 , Fig . 20 ) . 137 They found that the degrader could effectively induce the degradation of Bcl - xl protein in WI38 non - senescent cells ( NCs ) when the DC 50 and D max were 46 nM and 96 . 2 % , respectively . More importantly , it could effectively clear senescent cells and rejuvenate tissue stem and progenitor cells in naturally aged mice without causing severe thrombocytopenia . With further improvements , Bcl - xl PROTACs have the potential to become a safer and more effective treatment than Bcl - xl inhibitors . In 2021 , on the basis of analyzing the binding mode of DT2216 and Bcl - xl protein , they connected the VHL ligand with ABT - 263 from the methyl group of dimethylcyclohexene in ABT - 263 138 and ﬁ nally found that the chiral compound 78 ( PZ703b , Fig . 20 ) had the best degradation activity and cell Table 3 .

He et al . 16 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 growth inhibitory activity . In MOLT - 4 and RS4 ; 11 cells , the DC 50 to Bcl - xl were 14 . 3 nM and 11 . 6 nM , and the IC 50 were 15 . 9 nM and 11 . 3 nM , respectively . Its inhibitory activities were signi ﬁ - cantly better than the inhibitor ABT - 263 and the degrader DT2216 . It could not only induce the degradation of Bcl - xl , but also inhibit but not degrade BCL - 2 , which showed an unprecedented mixed dual - targeting mechanism in the PRO - TAC . They further found that PZ703b can form a stable { BCL - 2 : PROTAC : VCB } ternary complex in living cells , which may help PZ703b enhance its inhibitory effect on BCL - 2 . In the same year , they also developed a pomalidomide - based degrader 79 ( XZ424 , Fig . 20 ) 139 for Bcl - xl degradation by conjugating a potent and selective Bcl - xl inhibitor A - 1155463 . The degrader 79 ( XZ424 ) selectively induced Bcl - xl protein degradation in a dose and time - dependent manner in MOLT - 4 cells but not in platelets . The DC 50 was 50 nM and the IC 50 was 51 nM . Subsequently , they con ﬁ rmed that the platelet - toxic Bcl - xl / 2 dual inhibitor ABT - 263 can be converted into platelet - sparing pomalidomide - based Bcl - xl speci ﬁ c PROTAC without reduction in activity or selectivity . In addition to Zhou and Zheng group , Benowitz group also reported a degrader 80 ( Fig . 20 ) based on A - 1155463 and VHL ligand to target the degradation of Bcl - xl protein in 2020 . 140 They found that the degrader 80 can be used in THP - 1 to induce the degradation of Bcl - xl protein ef ﬁ ciently . And the 1 . 9 Å heterotetramer structure composed of ( ElonginB : Elon - ginC : VHL ) : PROTAC : Bcl - xl revealed the interaction between E3 ligase and target protein and PROTAC . The mode of action between the homologous part and the partner protein provided ideas for the subsequent design of protein – protein interaction inhibitors and degraders . Then , Zhou and Zheng group obtained a series of degraders based on DT2216 and the binding mode of ABT - 263 in Bcl - xl , which was linked the VHL to the methyl group of dimethylcy - clohexene in ABT - 263 . 141 They found 81 ( 753b , Fig . 20 ) was a better dual - target degrader targeting Bcl - xl and BCL - 2 , it could not only induce the degradation of Bcl - xl ( DC 50 = 6 nM ) , but also degrade BCL - 2 ( DC 50 = 48 nM ) in 293T cells . It was the ﬁ rst dual - targeted degrader for Bcl - xl / BCL - 2 . In addition , they also found 81 ( 753b ) exhibited more potent antitumor activity than DT2216 in Kasumi - 1 cells , which was also superior to that of ABT - 263 . Through the comparative analysis of the degradation activity and inhibitory activity of these degraders , it was found that the degradation activities of the degraders were better , the inhibitory activities were better in most cells . But in some Fig . 21 The representative PROTACs targeting BCR - ABL PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 17 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 special cell lines , such as 293T and THP - 1 cells , it was also reported that the degradation activities had no obvious in ﬂ uences with the inhibitory activities . The main reason may be that some cells were not sensitive to the changes of Bcl - xl protein . Finally , we compared the reported Bcl - xl degraders ( Table 3 ) . It was found that there were two types of Bcl - xl warheads currently in Bcl - xl PROTACs design , ABT - 263 and A - 1155463 . In the selection of E3 ligases , CRBN and VHL were currently used , and other E3 ligases were not used in Bcl - xl degrades . Therefore , more Bcl - xl degraders based on different Bcl - xl inhibitors need to be developed . BCR - ABL . Chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) is most often caused by the lack of autoinhibition of the c - ABL kinase domain in the oncogenic fusion protein BCR - ABL . 142 When the ABL gene is translocated from chromosome 9 to the BCR gene on chromo - some 22 , BCR - ABL is generated . BCR - ABL activates downstream signaling pathways to cause CML cell proliferation disorder in patients . 143 At present , three generations of BCR - ABL inhibitors have been approved for the clinical treatment of CML . As the ﬁ rst - generation ABL inhibitor , Imatinib becomes the paradigm for targeted cancer therapy . But the intolerance and drug resistance of Imatinib , especially for T315I , limits its clinical application . The second - generation ( Nilotinib , Dasatinib , and Bosutinib ) and third - generation ( Ponatinib ) ABL inhibitors provide multiple options for resistance patients . According to the difference between the inhibitors and the protein binding sites , ABL inhibitors also can be divided into ﬁ ve categories ( type I – V ) , among which type I ( such as Dasatinib ) , type II ( Imatinib and Ponatinib ) , and type IV ( Asciminib ) have been paied more attention . However , these inhibitors could not inhibit all resistant mutants ; severe side effects also limit their clinical applica - tion . 144 , 145 Therefore , it seems that the degradation of BCR - ABL may overcome these problems . In 2016 , Crews group reported the ﬁ rst BCR - ABL PROTAC based on Dasatinib , but it only achieved the degradation of BCR - ABL at micromoles ( > 60 % at 1 µM ) , but could not overcome the common drug - resistant mutants , especially for T315I mutant . 146 In 2019 , Crews group designed and synthesized a series of VHL - based BCR - ABL degraders by using the allosteric GNF family compounds of BCR - ABL . 147 They optimized the linker portion of the degraders to improve both potency and cell permeability , obtaining the lead degrader 82 ( GMB - 475 , Fig . 21 ) . The degrader induced rapid proteasomal degradation and inhibition of downstream biomar - kers in both human CML K562 cells and murine Ba / F3 cells . Besides , it inhibited the proliferation of BCL - ABL mutant Ba / F3 cells ( T315I and G250E ) more effectively than inhibitor Imatinib . Scaffold hopping is one of the common methods for structural modi ﬁ cation of drugs in medicinal chemistry , which is a method to obtain novel core scaffold by changing the core structure of known active compounds . Subsequently , they employed a scaffold hopping approach to enhance the activity of GMB - 475 to obtain the degrader 83 ( GMB - 805 , Fig . 21 ) . 148 The new BCL - ABL degrader 83 ( GMB - 805 ) demonstrated more than ten - folds increase in ability to induce BCL - ABL degradation , and improved pharmacokinetic properties and in vivo activity . In 2021 , Rao group developed some BCR - ABL degraders targeting all the three binding sites of BCR - ABL . 149 These BCL - ABL degraders were designed and synthesized using four BCR - ABL inhibitors Imatinib , Dasatinib , Asciminib , and Ponatinib as target molecules . In this toolbox for inducing degradation of BCR - ABL from different binding pockets , the degraders designed on the other three BCR - ABL inhibitors all worked obviously well except the Imatinib - based degraders . Among them , three representative degraders , 84 ( P22D , based on Dasatinib , DC 50 = 10 nM , Fig . 10 ) , 85 ( P19As , based on Asciminib , DC 50 = 200 nM , Fig . 10 ) , and 86 ( P19P , based on Ponatinib , DC 50 = 20 nM , Fig . 10 ) exhibited effective degradation activity for wild - type BCL - ABL , and also showed good cytostatic activity . More importantly , 86 ( P19P ) could ef ﬁ ciently induce the degradation of wild - type and mutated BCR - ABL ( Dasatinib - resistant T315I , Asciminib - resistant V468F mutants , E255K and H396R ) in transfected HeLa cells without causing serious side effects . And it also exhibited better antiproliferative activity against T315I mutant BaF3 cell line , with EC 50 of 28 . 5 nM . Through the above studies , it could found that PROTACs designed based on the type I inhibitor Dasatinib , the type II inhibitor Bonatinib and the type IV inhibitor Asciminib can successfully induce the degradation of the BCR - ABL protein . The degradation activities of PROTACs designed based on Dasatinib were signi ﬁ cantly better than that of other PROTACs , while the PROTACs designed based on type II inhibitor Imatinib could not induce the degradation of BCR - ABL protein under the concentra - tion of 30 µM . It indicated that the degraders based on type II inhibitors can be designed to induce the degradation of BCR - ABL Table 4 . The summary and comparison of PROTACs targeting BCR - ABL No .

He et al . 18 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 protein , but it requires more careful consideration that the design of degraders based on Imatinib to induce the degradation of BCR - ABL . In summary , these PROTACs showed better selectivity and fewer adverse reactions than inhibitors , which indicated that PROTACs have great potential in overcoming the clinical resistance and safety issues of BCR - ABL . Recently , Lu group described a new class of selective BCR - ABL T315I degraders based on a BCR - ABL T315I inhibitor GZD824 . 150 The degrader 87 ( Fig . 21 ) exhibited the most potent degradation ef ﬁ cacy with DR of 69 . 89 % and 94 . 23 % at 100 and 300 nM , respectively . In addition , the degrader 87 had an IC 50 value of 26 . 8 nM against Ba / F3 T315I cells and also showed signi ﬁ cant tumor regression in this mutation xenograft model in vivo . In 2019 , Jiang group reported the degrader 88 ( SIAIS178 , Fig . 21 ) by connecting Dasatinib and VHL by extensive optimization of linkers . 151 The degrader 88 ( SIAIS178 ) induced the effective degradation of wild - type BCR - ABL with the DC 50 value of 8 . 1 nM in K562 cells , and several clinically relevant resistance - conferring mutations . Moreover , it achieved signi ﬁ cant growth inhibition of the BCR - ABL + leukemic cells in vitro , and induced substantial tumor regression in vivo against K562 xenograft tumors . Subsequently , Jiang group synthesized a series of CRBN - based degraders by conjugating Dasatinib to pomali - domide or lenalidomide . 152 As an important example , a pomalidomide - based degrader 89 ( SIAIS056 , Fig . 21 ) , possessing sulfur - substituted carbon chain linker , exhibited the potent degradation of wild - type and clinically relevant resistance - conferring mutations of BCR - ABL . Furthermore , the degrader 89 ( SIAIS056 ) , with favorable pharmacokinetics , induced signi ﬁ cant tumor regression against K562 xenograft tumors in vivo . In addition , they reported a highly ef ﬁ cient protocol to construct a new IMiD - based azide library through click reaction . The degraders 90 ( SIAIS629050 , Fig . 21 ) and 91 ( SIAIS629051 , Fig . 21 ) showed good antiproliferative activity with IC 50 of 1 . 5 nM and 2 . 9 nM in K562 cells , and exhibited potent degradation activity of wild - type BCR - ABL in a dose - dependent manner . This approach provided help for the rapid construction of degraders libraries . Some examples reported recently have further enriched the tools for PROTAC - induced degradation of BCR - ABL . Based on the natural product Nimbolide , a covalent recruiter for the E3 ligase RNF114 , Nomura group developed a novel PROTAC linking Nimbolide to Dasatinib to obtain the degrader 92 ( BT1 , Fig . 21 ) , which could selectively induce the degradation of BCR - ABL over c - ABL in leukemia cancer cells . 153 Compared with the previously reported cereblon or VHL - recruiting BCR - ABL degra - ders , it showed the unique degradation speci ﬁ city pro ﬁ les . These achievements pave a way to develop more drug - like PROTACs for degrading BCR - ABL in the future . In 2020 , Jiang group also developed a novel photo - switchable azobenzene - PROTAC 93 ( Azo - PROTAC - 4C , Fig . 21 ) . 154 They could control the degradation of ABL and BCR - ABL proteins in live cells by changing the con ﬁ guration of Azo - PROTAC with UV - C light . Finally , we compared the reported BCR - ABL degraders ( Table 4 ) . It was found that there were various types of BCR - ABL warheads currently in BCR - ABL PROTACs design , but Dasatinib was still the most frequently used inhibitor . In the selection of E3 ligases , CRBN and VHL were currently used , and other E3 ligase such as RNF114 were also used in BCR - ABL degraders . FAK . Focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) is a cytoplasmic non - receptor protein tyrosine kinase , which is a member of the focal adhesion complex family . 155 , 156 It mediates multiple signaling pathways , such as PI3K / AKT and RAS / MAPK , and also plays an important role in cell invasion and metastasis . FAK exerts kinase - dependent enzyme function and kinase - independent scaffold function which can ’ t be investigated with kinase inhibitors . 157 The emergence of PROTACs technology opens a new door for studying the non - enzymatic function of FAK . In 2020 , Gray group published the patent on FAK degraders . 158 The patent showed that they designed a large number of FAK degraders based on FAK inhibitor VS - 4718 and different E3 ligase ligands . In the subsequent activity screening , they found that most of the compounds have good FAK - degradation activity . Among them , the degrader 94 ( Fig . 22 ) had relatively potent FAK - degradation activity , which could induce degradation of more than 85 % FAK protein at 10 nM . Recently , GSK has also developed a new type of potent and selective degrader 95 ( GSK - 215 , Fig . 22 ) based on VS - 4718 and VHL ligand . 159 Interestingly , it was con ﬁ rmed that degrader 95 ( GSK - 215 ) which possessed a short and rigid linker generated a highly cooperative ternary complex by SPR and X - ray crystal - lography data . It induced the degradation of FAK with DC 50 of 1 . 3 nM in A549 cells and induced cell proliferation inhibition in A549 , MCF - 7 cells rather than BT474 cells . The levels of other proteins would also be affected when the concentration was increased to 100 nM , such as CDK7 , RPS6KA3 , MET , and GAK . In Fig . 23 The representative PROTACs targeting MDM2 PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 19 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 addition , the degrader 95 ( GSK - 215 ) induced fast , effective , and durable FAK degradation in vivo in mouse liver . MDM2 . p53 is an important tumor suppressor which can promote the apoptosis of cancer cells and prevent the development of tumors . Nearly 50 % of human cancers are related to the abnormal activity of p53 . The interaction between p53 and MDM2 is the main factor affecting the biological activity of p53 . 160 MDM2 is one of the key inhibitors of p53 . It is highly expressed in a variety of tumors and plays an important role in the occurrence and development of tumors . Overexpression of MDM2 can down - regulate the expression of p53 , and inhibiting or degrading the MDM2 protein can block the MDM2 – p53 interaction and upregulate the expression of p53 , thereby exerting antitumor activity . 161 Therefore , the development of antitumor drugs targeting MDM2 – p53 has become one of the important methods to treat tumors . Although several MDM2 – p53 inhibitors have entered clinical trials , no drugs have been approved for clinical use . In 2018 , Wang group reported the potent MDM2 degrader MD - 224 . Based on the structure of MD - 224 , they designed and synthesized other MD - 224 analogs in 2019 . They found that the degrader 96 ( MG - 277 , Fig . 23 ) was not only a degrader for MDM2 , but also a molecular glue for inducing degradation of GSPT1 . 162 The degrader 96 ( MG - 277 ) only induced moderate degradation of MDM2 , but had very good degradation activity of GSPT1 with DC 50 of 1 . 3 nM . It could not activate wild - type p53 , but it had good antiproliferative activity in a variety of cells . For example , in RS4 ; 11 and HL - 60 cells , its IC 50 were 3 . 5 nM and 8 . 3 nM , respectively . Subsequently , they also tested the antiproliferative activity of the degrader 96 ( MG - 277 ) in MDA - MB - 231 si MDM2 and MDA - MB - 468 si MDM2 cell lines , which IC 50 were 19 . 3 nM and 19 . 8 nM , respectively , indicating that the degrader 96 ( MG - 277 ) exerted antiproliferative activity not only through the MDM2 - p53 pathway , but also played a related physiological role through the degrada - tion of GSPT1 . In 2021 , Wang group designed and synthesized a series of degraders based on ursolic acid ( UA ) and pomalidomide . 163 During the screening process , they found that the degrader 97 ( 1B , Fig . 23 ) had signi ﬁ cant inhibitory activity in different tumor cells . The IC 50 values in A549 , Huh7 , and HepG2 were 230 , 390 , and 380 nM , respectively . Then they conducted mechanism studies and the western blotting results showed that the degrader 97 ( 1B ) induced the signi ﬁ cant degradation of MDM2 and promoted the expression of P21 and PUMA proteins thereby inhibiting the proliferation of tumor cells and promoting the apoptosis of A549 cells . This was the ﬁ rst research on MDM2 degraders designed Fig . 25 The representative PROTACs targeting JAK Fig . 24 The representative PROTACs targeting FLT3 PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 20 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 based on natural products , which provided ideas for the development of MDM2 degraders . In 2021 , Tang group reported a series of MDM2 ligands which were designed and synthesized based on the four - component Ugi reaction , and then synthesized MDM2 degraders based on these ligands . 164 After extensive optimization based on anti - proliferative activity and MDM2 - degradation activity , the degra - der 98 ( WB214 , Fig . 23 ) was determined to be the degrader with the best MDM2 - degradation activity in leukemia cells . In RS4 ; 11 cells , the MDM2 - degradation activity DC 50 was 4 . 1 nM . In addition , they also found that the degrader 98 ( WB214 ) also induced the degradation of p53 with DC 50 of 29 nM . Further studies have shown that it was a molecular glue that induced the degradation of MDM2 . At the same time , it could effectively induce the degradation of GSPT1 and showed strong proliferation inhibitory activity on cells . In RS4 ; 11 cells , its inhibitory activity IC 50 was 1 . 2 nM . Also in 2021 , Sheng group reported the homo - PROTAC designed based on MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin - 3 derivatives targeted degradation of MDM2 . 165 Since MDM2 was an E3 ligase , when MDM2 inhibitors were used as ligands , they could not only target MDM2 , but also could combine with E3 ligase . The results showed that the degrader 99 ( 11a , Fig . 23 ) could effectively induce the dimerization of MDM2 with highly competitive binding activity and induce the degradation of MDM2 protein in A549 cells . The DC 50 and D max were 1 . 01 µM and 95 % , respectively . At the same time , it showed good antiproliferative activity on a variety of tumor cells . However , because the degrader 99 ( 11a ) was a compound with chiral centers , they puri ﬁ ed enantiomer 100 ( 11a - 1 , Fig . 23 ) and found that its antiproliferative activities in tumor cells were signi ﬁ cantly better than that of degrader 99 ( 11a ) . It was found enantiomer 100 ( 11a - 1 ) showed strong antitumor activity in vivo in the A549 xenograft nude mouse model . JAK / STAT signaling pathway - related proteins FLT3 . FMS - like tyrosine kinase 3 ( FLT3 ) is a type III receptor tyrosine kinase that regulates hematopoiesis . It is expressed on the surface of many hematopoietic cells and is essential for the normal development of hematopoietic stem cells and hemato - poietic cells . After FLT3 binds to ligands , it will dimerize or autophosphorylate and activate JAK - STAT , PI3K , and MAPK signaling pathways , which can promote tumor cell proliferation and differentiation or inhibit tumor cell apoptosis . 166 FLT3 is expressed in most AML patients and exists 30 % mutations . The mutations of FLT3 mainly include internal tandem duplication alteration ( FLT3 - ITD ) and point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain , accounting for 25 % and 5 % , respectively . Mutation or high expression of FLT3 may cause the continuous activation of the protein , leading to acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia . 167 There are currently eight drugs that can act on FLT3 have been approved , but these drugs have poor selectivity and can cause gastrointestinal intolerance , long - term cytopenias , hand - foot syndrome and other side effects . 168 In addition , the single drug has limited ef ﬁ cacy in AML patients with FLT3 mutations . So it is particularly important to use new technologies to develop treatment targeting FLT3 and mutations . In 2021 , Yang group obtained a series of PROTACs based on the binding model of Dovitinib and FLT3 . 169 After screening in vitro antiproliferative activity , it was found that the degrader 101 ( Fig . 24 ) and 102 ( Fig . 24 ) had signi ﬁ cant antiproliferative effects on MOLM - 13 and MV4 - 11 cells ( FLT3 - ITD - positive AML cells ) , which were better than the inhibitor Dovitinib . Subsequently , they tested the degradation activities of these two degraders on FLT3 in MOLM - 13 and MV4 - 11 cells , and the results showed that both the two degraders could induce the ef ﬁ cient degradation of FLT3 protein . The DC 50 of the degrader 101 to FLT3 in MOLM - 13 and MV4 - 11 cells were 8 . 0 nM and 6 . 9 nM , respectively . While the DC 50 of the degrader 102 in these two cells were 311 nM and 150 nM , respectively . In addition , they also proved that these two degraders completely block the downstream signaling pathways at low concentrations . And in the mouse model of vein transplantation , the degrader 101 and 102 could also show a signi ﬁ cant inhibitory effect on the proliferation of MV4 - 11 cells in vivo . Also in 2021 , Chen group also reported the FLT3 degrader 103 ( PF15 , Fig . 24 ) . 170 They found 103 ( PF15 ) could induce the degradation of FLT3 in BaF3 - FLT3 - ITD cells with DC 50 of 76 . 7 nM . JAK . Janus kinase ( JAK ) is a family of non - receptor tyrosine kinases , including JAK1 , JAK2 , JAK3 , and Tyk2 . Signal and activator of transcription ( STAT ) , the substrate of JAK , dimerizes after being phosphorylated by JAK and then crosses the nuclear membrane into the nucleus to regulate the expression of related genes . JAK - STAT pathway is a major signal transduction mechanism of various cytokines and growth factors and has been implicated in a multitude of diseases from cancer to in ﬂ ammatory diseases . 171 Given the importance of the JAK - STAT pathway , blocking the function of JAK can silence the entire pathway , which has important implications for scienti ﬁ c research and disease treat - ment . Although several JAK kinase inhibitors have entered clinical research , they are usually dif ﬁ cult to achieve selectivity due to the high homology of JAK family proteins . 172 Therefore , the rise of PROTACs technology provides a new strategy for the study of JAK proteins . In 2020 , GSK developed the ﬁ rst - in - class PROTACs targeting JAK proteins based on two pan - inhibitors which have pyrimidine and quinoxaline scaffold , respectively . 173 They then tested the degradation activities of these degraders to endogenous JAK1 and JAK2 in THP - 1 cells through automated western blotting . They found that the degraders 104 – 109 ( J1 - J6 , Fig . 25 ) were able to induce the degradation of JAK1 and JAK2 , which showed no selective degradation . And JAK3 protein was not detected in these cells . The results also proved that the PROTACs bearing an IAP E3 ligase ligand could induce signi ﬁ cant degradation of JAK1 and JAK2 in THP - 1 cells while VHL and CRBN - based PROTACs could not . In 2021 , Mullighan group designed and synthesized a large number of PROTACs based on the binding modes of Ruxotinib Fig . 26 The representative PROTAC targeting STAT3 Fig . 27 The representative PROTAC targeting β - catenin PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 21 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 and Barictinib with JAK protein . 174 Through protein degradation and MTT experiment screening , it was found that most of the compounds had good JAK2 kinase degradation activity , but they also had certain GSPT1 degradation activity , especially the degrader 110 ( Fig . 25 ) and 111 ( Fig . 25 ) . In order to minimize the molecular weight and polar surface area of PROTAC and improve its cell permeability , they also synthesized the N - propyl analog degrader 112 ( Fig . 25 ) . And in order to avoid GSPT1 degradation , degrader 113 ( Fig . 39 ) was also designed and synthesized . The degradation activities of these degraders were tested on MHH - CALL - 4 cells . They found that the degrader 110 and 111 could induce the degradation of JAK1 / 2 / 3 , and also had good degradation activity on GSPT1 / IKZF1 . The degrader 112 could induce the degradation of JAK1 / 3 and also had good degradation activity for GSPT1 / IKZF1 , while the degrader 113 could only induce the degradation of JAK2 . Subsequently , they tested the antiproliferative activity of these degraders . They found that the activity of the degraders was better than that of the corresponding inhibitors . At the same time , the activity of the degrader 113 with better selectivity was signi ﬁ cantly worse than that of degrader 110 – 112 , which indicated that the antiproliferative activity was not only due to Janus kinase degradation . Finally , they tested the inhibitory activity of degraders in ALL tumor cells derived from different patients . These cells were in different genetic recombination backgrounds , including CRLF2r , EPORr , JAK2r , IL7R / SH2B3 muta - tions , and so on . Most tumors were sensitive to degraders but not sensitive to the corresponding inhibitors , and the inhibitory activities of the degrader 113 were relatively poor . STAT3 . Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) is a member of the STAT family of transcription factors that replicates and transmits signals from cell surface receptors to the nucleus . 175 The continuous activation of STAT3 is often associated with the poor prognosis of human cancer because the activated STAT3 signal can not only promote the growth , survival , and metastasis of tumor cells but also inhibit the antitumor immune response . 176 Therefore , STAT3 is an attractive target for the treatment of human cancer and other human diseases . Although scientists have been working tirelessly on this target for 20 years , targeting STAT3 is still very challenging . In 2021 , Wang group developed a new STAT3 degrader 114 ( SD - 91 , Fig . 26 ) , 177 which was generated by the gem - di ﬂ uoride of a previously reported STAT3 degrader SD - 36 178 convert into a ketone . The degrader SD - 36 could convert into degrader 114 ( SD - 91 ) in the cell culture media rapidly , with nearly 50 % of conversion observed at 2 h and 90 % of conversion at 24 h . However , the degrader 114 ( SD - 91 ) exhibited excellent stability in the cell culture media and the in vivo dosing vehicle . The degrader 114 ( SD - 91 ) bound to STAT3 protein with a high af ﬁ nity , and was more potent than SD - 36 in inducing degradation of STAT3 in SU - DHL - 1 and MOLM - 16 lymphoma cells . A single administration of the degrader 114 ( SD - 91 ) could selectively and continuously reduce STAT3 in tumor tissues . Moreover , the degrader 114 ( SD - 91 ) achieved complete and long - lasting tumor regression in the MOLM - 16 xenograft model in mice even with weekly administra - tion . The degrader 114 ( SD - 91 ) represented a promising STAT3 degrader for the treatment of human cancers and other diseases related to STAT3 overactivation . Wnt / β - catenin signaling pathway - related proteins β - Catenin . Among many signal pathways , the aberrant activation of Wnt / β - catenin signal is the most important for the occurrence and development of various cancer . 179 More than 80 % of cancer patients have inactivating mutations of APC or activating mutations of CTNNB1 , leading to the messenger molecule β - catenin protein continuing to accumulate in cells , which eventually leads to the excessive activation of Wnt / β - catenin signal and the proliferation of cancer cells . 180 As β - catenin is the central player of the canonical Wnt / β - catenin signaling and is frequently mutated in cancers , it is the most attractive target for cancer therapy . 181 However , β - catenin has no enzymatic activity and small - molecule binding pockets , and has a large interaction interface with other proteins . Therefore , it is dif ﬁ cult for such small molecule inhibitors to completely inhibit the function of β - catenin . 182 Thus , inducing the degradation of β - catenin is an ideal method for treating Wnt / β - catenin signal - related diseases . Based on the Axin - derived peptide that binds to β - catenin , a stapled peptides xStAx was reported to impair Wnt / β - catenin signaling . 183 Recently , β - catenin - targeting degrader 115 ( xStAx - VHL L , Fig . 27 ) was developed by coupling xStAx with the VHL ligand to achieve ef ﬁ cient β - catenin degradation . 184 Although they had clinical limitations as peptide - based PROTACs , they still displayed long - term degradation of β - catenin and strong inhibition of Wnt / β - catenin signaling in cancer cells and in APC / organoids . Furthermore , the degrader 115 ( xStAx - VHL L ) could effectively restrain tumor formation in BALB / C nude mice and potently inhibit the survival of colorectal cancer patient - derived organoids . In the future , it would be worthwhile to develop a β - catenin - targeting degrader with good pharmacodynamics for clinical therapies . FOXM1 . The forkhead box superfamily is a class of transcription factors with a speci ﬁ c “ winged helix structure ” DNA binding domain , including several families such as FOXA , FOXC , FOXM , FOXO , and FOXP . 185 FOXM1 ( forkhead box protein M1 ) is one of the key genes controlling cell proliferation and its abnormal activation is closely related to the proliferation and division of cancer cells . It is generally upregulated in laryngeal cancer , gastric cancer , ovarian cancer , etc . 185 – 188 And tumor gene expression pro ﬁ ling analysis also con ﬁ rmed that FOXM1 is one of the most frequently upregulated genes in human malignant tumors , 189 so it has become an important target for drug development . Xiang research group synthesized a potent PROTAC degrader 116 ( Fig . 28 ) based on the binding mode of FOXM1 inhibitor FDI - 6 . 190 They proved that degrader 116 could induce the degradation of FOXM1 protein in MDA - MB - 231 cells . The DC 50 was 1 . 96 µM and GI 50 for cell proliferation inhibition was 16 . 2 µM , which was slightly better than the corresponding inhibitor . This was the ﬁ rst time to use PROTAC technology to induce the degradation of FOXM1 . GPCR - related proteins α 1A - AR . Adrenergic receptors ( AR ) are divided into two cate - gories : α subtype and β subtype . α adrenergic receptor is a type of G - protein - coupled receptor , mainly including α 1 and α 2 , which mediate mostly excitatory function . Among them , α 1 - ARs play an Fig . 28 The representative PROTAC targeting FOXM1 Fig . 29 The representative PROTAC targeting α 1A - AR PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 22 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 important role in many physiological processes , including smooth muscle contraction , myocardial time - varying force , liver glycogen metabolism and so on . 191 , 192 α 1 - ARs are divided into three subtypes : α 1A , α 1B , and α 1D . α 1A - AR is crucial in maintaining basic blood pressure , 193 α 1B - AR is of signi ﬁ cance in the regulation of blood pressure by catecholamines , 194 and α 1D - AR is important in both physiological responses . 195 Therefore , α 1 - ARs are important targets for the treatment of hypertension , 196 benign prostatic hypertrophy , 197 prostate cancer 198 and other diseases . Especially , due to the fact that the α 1A - AR has a close relationship to the Fig . 30 The representative PROTACs targeting BRD PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 23 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 proliferation of prostate cancer cells . 199 , 200 Therefore , the devel - opment of α 1A - AR selective degrader can provide a new method for the treatment of prostate cancer . In 2020 , Li group developed the α 1A - AR degrader 117 ( Fig . 29 ) based on 4 - amino - 6 , 7 - dimethoxy - 2 - ( piperazin - l - yl ) - quinazoline core of prazosin derivatives , 201 which endured antagonism to α 1 - ARs . This was the ﬁ rst PROTAC for GPCRs . The PROTAC was conjugated with prazosin and pomalidomide through different linkers . These PROTACs induced the slight degradation of α 1A - AR in α 1A - AR stably transfected HEK293 cells . And compound 117 showed the best degradation activity with the drug treatment for 12 h , and the DC 50 value approximately was 2 . 86 µM in the treated HEK293 cells . For the HEK293 cells treated with 10 µM compound 117 for 12 h , the D max reached up to 94 % . Then they test the antiproliferative activity of the compound 117 in androgen - independent PC - 3 prostate cancer cells . They found that the antiproliferative activity of 117 ( IC 50 = 6 . 12 µM ) was better than that of Prazosin ( IC 50 = 11 . 72 µM ) in PC - 3 cells . At last , they found compound 117 resulted in an inhibition in tumor growth when they conducted an in vivo study to examine its in ﬂ uence . Epigenetics - related proteins BRD . Lysine acetylation in histone tails has been associated with epigenetic . Bromodomian are highly conserved module which recognize acetylated lysine , it has been shown that 46 proteins contain 61 unique bromodomian so far . 202 Most of them play important role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling and have been widely studied as a key target for the treatment of cancer . The bromo and extral terminal domain family ( BET ) proteins , which include BRD2 , BRD3 , BRD4 and testis - speci ﬁ c BRDT , are the most widely studied class of bromodomain - containing proteins . In recent years , a large number of inhibitors targeting BET proteins have been reported , 203 – 208 most of them showed good tumor suppression and partial compounds enter clinical studies success - fully . Since the ﬁ rst degrader dBET1 was reported by Brander group in 2015 , 2 a number of PROTACs targeting BET proteins have been developed . However , due to the high homology of BET proteins , it is still dif ﬁ cult to achieve the selectivity of BET protein subtypes . Since Polo - like kinase 1 ( PLK1 ) and bromodomain 4 ( BRD4 ) are both attractive therapeutic targets in acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , Lu group developed BRD4 and PLK1 degrader 118 ( HBL - 4 , Fig . 30 ) based on a dual - target inhibitor BI2536 . 209 The degrader 118 ( HBL - 4 ) induced ef ﬁ cient and fast degradation in human acute leukemia cells tested in vitro and vivo , such as MV4 - 11 , MOLM - 13 , and KG1 . It exhibited potent anti - proliferation in these cells and more effectively suppresses c - Myc levels than inhibitor BI2536 . Meanwhile , the degrader 118 ( HBL - 4 ) induced dramati - cally improved ef ﬁ cacy in the MV4 - 11 tumor xenograft model compared with BI2536 , which may be a potential therapy for the treatment of acute leukemia and other types of tumors . In 2019 , Ciulli group introduced macrocyclization into PROTACs based on the structure of reported BET degrader MZ1 . Macro - cyclization could restrict the molecule in its bioactive conforma - tion to reduce the energetic penalty , which has been widely used as a strategy to develop drug selectivity . They synthesized the degrader 119 ( MacPROTAC - 1 , Fig . 30 ) which induced more obvious af ﬁ nity discrimination between BD1 and BD2 to the BET degrader MZ1 by adding a cyclizing linker and solved the co - crystal structure of VHL - 119 ( MacPROTAC - 1 ) - BRD4 BD2 . 210 Compared with MZ1 , the degrader 119 ( MacPROTAC - 1 ) showed similar degradation activity and inhibition of cell proliferation in BET - sensitive human prostate carcinoma 22RV1 cells , although the binding af ﬁ nity to BRD4 decreased . Despite the pan - inhibitors or degraders targeting BET proteins have achieved great success in treating tumors , lack of subtybe selectivity limits their applications as biological tools and anticancer drugs which could lead unwanted side effects or toxicity . In 2020 , Chen group reported degrader 120 ( Fig . 30 ) which achieved potently and selectivity for BRD2 and BRD4 over BRD3 derived from a BD1 selective inhibitor and thalidomide . 211 The degrader 120 completely induced the degradation of BRD4 at 1 μ M with 8h treatment and effectively inhibited cell growth with low cytotoxic effect in both hematoma and solid tumor cells , especially for acute myeloid lymphoma cells MV4 - 11 . Recently , Ciulli group designed trivalent PROTACs consisting of a bivalent BET inhibitor and an E3 ligand tethered via a branched linker . 212 Compared to bivalent PROTACs , the most active degrader 121 ( SM1 , Fig . 30 ) , a VHL - based trivalent degrader , displayed more sustained and higher degradation ef ﬁ cacy for BET family proteins which led to more potent anticancer activity . Mechanistically , the degrader 121 ( SM1 ) intramolecularly engaged BD2 and BD1 to form a 1 : 1 : 1 ternary complex with VHL and BRD4 with prolonged residence time . Although the molecular weight of the trivalent degrader had increased , the degrader 121 ( SM1 ) exhibited better cell permeability and the remarkably favorable PK pro ﬁ le . Besides several common structures such as JQ1 , more and more BET inhibitors have been used in the design and synthesis of PROTACs . In 2019 , Zhang group developed a new class of degrader based on a potent dihydroquinazolinone - based BRD4 inhibitor . 213 Among them , the best degrader 122 ( Fig . 30 ) completely induced the degradation of BRD4 at 1 μ M with 3h treatment and inhibited cell growth with an IC 50 of 0 . 81 μ M in THP - 1 cells , which was four - folds more potent than inhibitor in the antiproliferative assay . Subsequently , ABBV - 075 derivative was used to design PROTACs by Zhang group 214 and Yu group 215 successively . In 2020 , Zhang group introduced linkers at the position of pyrrole ring to obtain the degrader 123 ( Fig . 30 ) which induced the degradation of BRD4 , cell cycle arrest and apoptosis effectively in human pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC - 3 . Antiproliferative activity of the degrader 123 against BxPC - 3 cell line ( IC 50 = 0 . 165 μ M ) was Table 5 . The summary and comparison of PROTACs targeting BRD No .

He et al . 24 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 improved about seven - folds compared with ABBV - 075 . In 2021 , the sulfonyl group of ABBV - 075 was removed to connect with E3 by Yu group and led to the discovery of the degrader 124 ( Fig . 30 ) which induced the degradation of BRD4 with DC 50 of 0 . 25 nM and 3 . 15 nM in MV4 - 11 cells and RS4 - 11 cells . It also induced the proliferation inhibition in MV4 - 11 and RS4 - 11 cells with IC 50 of 0 . 5 nM and 4 . 8 nM , respectively . Given the important role of BET protein in cells , PROTACs targeting BET will inevitably cause toxic effects on normal cells , which limit the clinical application of BET degraders . So there are some strategies were adopted to make PROTACs regulated in space and time . The introduction of a photocaged group into PROTACs is a common method . In 2019 , Pan group introduced the bulky 4 , 5 - dimethoxy - 2 - nitrobenzyl ( DMNB ) group into dBET1 through the amide nitrogen of the linker to get the degrader 125 ( pc - PROTAC1 , Fig . 30 ) which induced the degradation of BRD4 in live cells and the expected changes of phenotypic in zebra ﬁ sh only after light irradiation . 216 As known that methylation of the imide nitrogen abolished degradation activity of a CRBN - based BRD4 degrader , Li group also installed DMNB groups on the glutarimide nitrogen of dBET1 to obtain the degrader 126 ( N2 , Fig . 30 ) , which was proved to induce the degradation of BRD4 in HEK293T cells and inhibit tongue squamous cell carcinoma ( TSCC ) HN - 6 cells growth in a zebra ﬁ sh xenograft model . 217 Subsequently , Deiters group successfully installed a 6 - nitropiperonloxymethyl ( NPOM ) group into the glutarimide nitrogen to generate the BRD4 degrader 127 ( Fig . 30 ) , which induced the potent degradation of BRD4 by treatment with 365 nm light in HEK293T cells . 218 And the DMNB group was attached to the hydroxyl group of VHL E3 ligase - recruiting ligand by Tate group in 2020 . 219 The degrader 128 ( Fig . 30 ) could induce the degradation of BRD4 after a short irradiation time under the live - cell video microscopy . It is well - known that more than 600 E3 ubiquitin ligases are encoded by the human genome , only a handful of E3 ligases ( VHL , CRBN , IAPs , and MDM2 ) could be used by PROTACs technology . BRD4 is a commonly used target for screening new E3 ligases for PROTACs . In 2019 , Cravatt group has validated that the E3 ligase subunit DCAF16 supported targeted protein degradation by synthesizing degrader 129 ( KB02 - JQ1 , Fig . 30 ) which induced the degradation of BRD4 with the engagement of DCAF16 . 220 However , KB02 - JQ1 could only induce the degradation of BRD4 at a concentration of 40 μ M . In 2020 , Chen group also developed a BRD4 degrader 130 ( DP1 , Fig . 30 ) based on JQ1 and DCAF15 ligand E7820 . 221 The results showed that 130 ( DP1 ) was the most potent degrader with DC 50 of 10 . 84 μ M and D max of 98 % in SU - DHL - 4 cells . Recently , Jin group synthesized the degrader 131 ( MS83 , Fig . 30 ) by connecting a highly potent , selective , and noncovalent KEAP1 ligand KI696 to the BET bromodomain pan - inhibitor ( + ) - JQ1 . 222 Interestingly , the degrader effectively induced the degradation of BRD4 and BRD3 protein levels , but did not have an in ﬂ uence on BRD2 protein and selectively induced the degradation of BRD4 short isoform over long isoform in MDA - MB - 231 cells . The CRBN - based PROTACs are known to be inherently unstable , readily undergoing hydrolysis in body ﬂ uids , which signi ﬁ cantly affects their cell ef ﬁ cacy . Recently , Rankovic group developed novel CRBN binders , phenyl glutarimide ( PG ) analogs , which retained high af ﬁ nity for CRBN and displayed improved chemical stability . 223 Based on this novel ligand , their group synthesized a novel BRD4 degrader 132 ( SJ995973 , Fig . 30 ) which inhibited the MV4 - 11 cells proliferation with an IC 50 value of 3 pM . Moreover , the degrader 132 ( SJ995973 ) exhibited the most potent degradation ef ﬁ cacy with DC 50 of 0 . 87 nM in MV4 - 11 cells . In 2021 , Fischer group developed a series of novel CRBN - based BRD4 BD1 L94V PROTAC based on a “ bump - and - hole ” approach . 224 By using cells stably expressing the BRD4 BD1 L94V degron fused to EGFP systems , the corresponding degrader 133 ( XY - 06 - 007 , Fig . 30 ) bound to BRD4 BD1 L94V with increased selectivity over the wild - type bromodomain , and exhibited potent and selectively degradation of BRD4 BD1 L94V with no degradation of wild - type and other BET family of bromodomains . In addition , the degrader 133 ( XY - 06 - 007 ) displayed acceptable pharmacokinetics pro ﬁ les , which made it suitable candidates for future in vivo studies . In recently , Ciulli group also developed a novel VHL - based degrader 134 ( AGB1 , Fig . 30 ) based on the “ bump - and - hole ” approach . 225 In an inducible BromoTag degron system , the degrader 134 ( AGB1 ) not only formed a strong , cooperative ternary complex between VHL and the BromoTag - BRD2 but also completely induced the degradation of BromoTagged target proteins with low nanomolar potency . The degrader 134 ( AGB1 ) exhibited exquisite selectivity over the native wild - type BET , which led it not cytotoxic in several cancer relevant cell lines . In summary , these two distinct methods provided a useful tool to study the effect and implications of rapid and highly selective degradation of a target protein . Also in 2021 , Jiang group reported the ef ﬁ cient construction of an IMiD - based azide compound library and applied this method to the development of BET protein degraders . The BET protein degraders 135 ( SIAIS629048 , Fig . 30 ) and 136 ( SIAIS629049 , Fig . 30 ) were obtained . 152 These two degraders showed strong BET protein - degradation activity when the concentration was 50 nM . At the same , it could show strong anti - proliferation inhibitory activity on MV4 - 11 cells . Recently , Wang group reported the selective BRD4 degrader 137 ( WWL0245 , Fig . 30 ) with potent antiproliferative effects in AR - positive prostate cancer based on a dual BET / PLK1 inhibitor WNY0824 226 The degrader 137 ( WWL0245 ) could effectively induce the degradation of BRD4 and the D max was more than 99 % in AR - positive prostate cancer cells . It had no degradation activity against other BRD subtype proteins . The degrader 137 ( WWL0245 ) also showed good antiproliferative activity in BETi - sensitive cancer cells ( including AR - positive prostate cancer cells ) with an IC 50 of 3 nM in MV4 - 11 cells . Finally , we compared the reported BRD degraders ( Table 5 ) . It was found that although there were various types of BRD warheads currently used , JQ1 was used more frequently and others were used less . In the selection of E3 ligases , most of the currently used were CRBN and VHL , and some new E3 ligases have Fig . 31 The representative PROTAC targeting CBP and p300 Fig . 32 The representative PROTAC targeting ENL PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 25 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 been mentioned in reports , such as DCAF15 , DCAF16 , etc . These cases were all in the development of new E3 ligases reportes . Therefore , more BRD degraders based on different BRD inhibitors need to be developed . CBP and p300 . The paralogous chromatin regulators CREB - binding protein ( CBP ) and p300 ( also known as KAT3A and KAT3B ) maintain gene expression programs through chromatin lysine acetylation and transcription regulation , as well as the scaffold function mediated by multiple protein – protein interaction domains . Several potency , selectivity , and drug - like properties of small - molecule inhibitors targeting these domains have been developed , which provided unique tools for exploring various p300 / CBP functions of enhancers . 227 However , inhibiting a single domain alone cannot completely eliminate the p300 / CBP activity in the cell . Thus , it is necessary to inhibit multiple functional domains at the same time , or even completely deplete the protein to ablate the p300 / CBP - mediated enhancer activity . 228 In 2021 , Ott group described the ﬁ rst CRBN - based p300 / CBP degrader 138 ( dCBP - 1 , Fig . 31 ) . 229 The degrader 138 ( dCBP - 1 ) induced the highly potent , selective , and rapid dual degradation of CBP and p300 , which highlighted the capability of applying PROTAC technology to exceptionally large proteins ( > 300 kDa ) . The degrader 138 ( dCBP - 1 ) had potent antiproliferative activity in multiple myeloma cells . Compared with the treatment of bromodomain and KAT domain inhibitors alone or in combina - tion , it had enhanced effects on MYC gene expression programs , anti - proliferation , and chromatin structure in multiple myeloma . As an effective degrader of this unique acetyltransferase , degrader 138 ( dCBP - 1 ) was a useful tool to analyze the mechanisms of these factors coordinate enhancer activity in normal and cancer cells . ENL . The YEATS domain is a new type of histone acetylation “ reader ” . The human genome encodes four YEATS domain - containing proteins , namely ENL , AF9 , YEATS2 , and GAS41 . 230 Among them , ENL protein is essential for the development of acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . 231 When ENL is knocked out , it would induce anti - leukemia effect and inhibit the growth of leukemia in vivo and in vitro . In 2021 , Erb group discovered the highly effective ENL YEATS domain inhibitor SR - 0813 based on high - throughput screening technology . On the basis of SR - 0813 , they designed and synthesized a degrader 139 ( SR - 1114 , Fig . 32 ) that targeted ENL . 232 It was found that the degrader 139 ( SR - 1114 ) could induce degradation of ENL protein in a variety of cell lines , and it had the best activity in the MV4 - 11 cells with DC 50 of 150 nM . HDAC . Histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) which serve as “ epigenetic erasers ” play an important role in chromosome structural modi ﬁ cation and gene expression regulation by catalyzing deacetylation of substrate proteins . They make histones bind tightly to negatively charged DNA by deacetylating them , which densify chromatin and inhibit gene transcription . Until now , 18 human HDACs have been identi ﬁ ed and classi ﬁ ed into four classes : Class I ( HDAC1 , 2 , 3 , and 8 ) , class II ( HDAC 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 9 , and 10 ) , class III ( SIRT1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 ) and class IV ( HDAC11 ) . 233 – 235 Class I HDAC is mainly located in the nucleus , and HDAC3 is also present in the cytoplasm . Class II can respond to different cell signal responses and shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm . Class III is a completely different type as the atypical histone deacetylase family of other HDACs . 236 , 237 Type IV is mainly located in the nucleus . HDAC6 , the only protein in the HDACs family that has two tandem domains , is mainly distributed in the cytoplasm . HADC6 deacetylates α - tubulin , HSP90 , cortactin and interacts with many proteins such as dynein , ubiquitin , which make it participate in cancer progression , neurodegenerative diseases , and in ﬂ amma - tory disorders . Rao group has been working on developing PROTACs targeting HDAC6 since 2019 , 238 they linked Fig . 33 The representative PROTACs targeting HDAC PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 26 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 pomalidomide to the benzene ring of NexA unlike NP8 , which led to the discovery of HDAC6 degrader 140 ( NH2 , Fig . 33 ) in 2019 . 239 When it was compared with NP8 , the degrader 140 ( NH2 ) exhibited comparably excellent degradation activity in MM . 1S cells with the DC 50 of 3 . 2 nM . The two degraders extended from different directions of the inhibitor exerted the same degradation activity revealed the extremely large ﬂ exibility of the ternary complex . In 2020 , on the basis of previous work , Tang group replaced pomalidomide in the structure of HDAC6 degrader with VHL and obtained the ﬁ rst selective HDAC6 degrader . 240 Among them , the degrader 141 ( Fig . 33 ) showed the best degradation activity in MM . 1S with DC 50 of 7 . 1 nM and the D max of 90 % . In addition , they also tested its HDAC6 degradation activity in mouse cells . In the mouse 4935 cell line , the DC 50 was 4 . 3 nM and the D max was 57 % . Subsequently , they developed a competition assay to evaluate binding af ﬁ nity of different E3 ligands in cells and screened a library of thalidomide analogs , including those with partial linkers . After screening , the most active E3 ligase ligands were conjugated to pan - inhibitor SAHA led to the discovery of a selective HDAC6 degrader 142 ( YZ167 , Fig . 33 ) . 241 The DC 50 of the degrader 142 ( YZ167 ) was 1 . 94 nM in MM . 1S cells . At the same time , it was found that the degrader 143 ( YZ268 , Fig . 33 ) designed based on HDAC6 - selective inhibitor Next - A also had selective degradation activity for HDAC6 during the screening process , without in ﬂ uence on neo - substrate IKZFs and GSPT1 . In 2021 , He group also reported another HDAC6 degrader based on CDK / HDAC6 inhibitor derived from Indirubin . 242 They eval - uated the degradation activities of HDAC6 in K562 cells . Interestingly , the PROTAC 144 ( Fig . 33 ) demonstrated the most superior HDAC6 degradation with DC 50 of 108 . 9 nM and D max of 88 % . Also , they found the degrader 144 ( Fig . 33 ) upregulated acetylation of α - tubulin without any obvious degradation of HDAC1 and CDK2 in K562 and HeLa cells . In addition to these degraders that selectively targeting HDAC6 , other research groups have also reported degraders targeting other subtypes of HDAC in 2020 . For example , Hodgkinson group reported a degrader 145 ( Fig . 33 ) targeting class I HDAC ( HDAC1 / 2 / 3 ) designed based on VHL and HDAC inhibitor CI - 994 . 243 They found that the degrader 145 could induce the degradation of HDAC1 / 2 / 3 in HCT116 cells . Zhang group attempted to design PROTACs targeting HDAC6 based on Bestatin and SAHA by recruiting cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 ( cIAP1 ) E3 ubiquitin ligase . 244 However , effective degradation of HDAC1 / 6 / 8 could be observed in RPMI - 8226 cells . What interesting was that the degradation effect of the degrader was not obvious when the cells were treated for 6 hours . However , the degradation effect on the three subtypes of HDAC was signi ﬁ cantly enhanced when the treatment time was extended to 24 hours . The degrader 146 ( Fig . 33 ) exhibited more potent aminopeptidase N ( APN , CD13 ) inhibitory activities and anti - angiogenic activities than the approved APN inhibitor Bestatin , which made it work as a potent APN and HDAC dual inhibitor and HDAC1 / 6 / 8 degrader instead of just a degrader . The degrader 147 ( Fig . 33 ) was designed by Hansen group based on pomalidomide and SAHA . 245 Although it could show strong inhibitory activity against a variety of subtypes of HDAC , in subsequent experiments they found that the degrader 147 could only induce the degradation of HDAC1 and HDAC6 , which proved the difference between the selectivity and af ﬁ nity activity of degrader . It provided a reference for the subsequent design of selective degraders . KDM5C . Epigenetic plays an important role in various biological functions . They are not only closely related to the normal functions of the human body , but also related to the occurrence and development of many diseases . Therefore , it an effective means that controlling epigenetic changes to treat diseases . Histone methylation is a reversible genetic modi ﬁ cation . Histone methylation and demethylation are in a dynamic equilibrium process , which participates in the regulation of gene transcription and other biological events . 246 The imbalance between histone methylation and demethylation may play an important role in the Fig . 34 The representative PROTAC targeting KDM5C Fig . 35 The representative PROTAC targeting NAMPT Fig . 36 The representative PROTAC targeting NSD3 PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 27 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 occurrence and development of tumors . Many histone demethy - lase inhibitors have been reported , but no drugs have been approved so far . 247 Therefore , traditional small - molecule histone demethylase inhibitors have insuf ﬁ cient stamina in the treatment of diseases . 248 So developing degraders targeting histone demethylases based on PROTAC technology has become a feasible solution . In 2021 , Suzuki group reported histone demethylase degrader 148 ( Fig . 34 ) designed based on KDM5C inhibitor . 249 They found that the degrader 148 had good degradation activity in prostate cancer PC - 3 cells . When the concentration was 5 µM , obvious protein degradation could be observed . With the increase of drug concentration , the degradation activity was obviously enhanced . It was also proved that the antiproliferative activity of degrader 148 on tumor cells was signi ﬁ cantly better than inhibitor . Although the degradation activity was not excellent , as the ﬁ rst case of histone demethylase degrader , it laid the foundation for the subsequent development of related target degraders . NAMPT . Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase ( NAMPT ) is a cytokine that promotes B - cell maturation and inhibits neutrophil apoptosis . 250 It is the rate - limiting enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD + ) . Since tumor cells have a high demand for large amounts of NAD + , inhibiting NAMPT expression can signi ﬁ cantly inhibit tumor cell proliferation . It has been con ﬁ rmed that NAMPT is highly expressed in various malignant tumors such as breast cancer , prostate cancer , gastric cancer , thyroid cancer , colon cancer and hematological tumors . 251 Therefore , NAMPT is considered as a drug target for antitumor therapy . 252 Based on the binding mode of inhibitor MS7 and NAAMPT , a series of PROTAC molecules were obtained by connecting MS7 with VHL ligands . 253 Then it was found that 149 ( A7 , Fig . 35 ) was an effective degrader of NAMPT protein . Intracellular NAMPT ( iNAMPT ) could be degraded by 149 ( A7 ) through the ubiquitin – proteasome system , thereby in turn decreases the secretion of extracellular NAMPT ( eNAMPT ) . At the same time , they also found that the inhibitor MS7 did not have the function of inhibiting tumor - in ﬁ ltrating MDSCs , and the degrader could boost antitumor ef ﬁ cacy through this effect , so the degrader 149 ( A7 ) exhibited stronger antiproliferative activity than the inhibitor MS7 . NSD3 . Histone lysine methyltransferase catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups to speci ﬁ c lysine side chains at the ends of histones H3 and H4 to form histone methylation marks , thereby affecting gene transcription , DNA replication , and DNA repair . It plays an important role in maintaining chromatin stability and gene expression regulation . Representative lysine methylases include PRDM6 , G9a , EZH2 , DOT1L , NSD , and SUV420H1 . 254 NSD is a nuclear receptor - binding SET domain protein ( NSD ) family , including three members of NSD1 , NSD2 ( also known as MMSET or WHSC1 ) and NSD3 ( also known as WHSC1L1 ) . NSD3 is a Lysine methyltransferase at position 36 of histone H3 ( H3K36 ) , catalyzes the dimethylation of H3K36 . 255 NSD methyltransferases are mutated , ampli ﬁ ed , and overexpressed in a variety of human cancers , including multiple myeloma , acute myeloid leukemia , acute lymphoblastic leukemia , breast cancer , prostate cancer , and lung cancer . 256 Therefore , NSD is considered as a potential target for the development of novel anticancer drugs . BI - 9321 is a reported NSD3 PWWP1 antagonist . By analyzing its binding mode with NSD3 protein , Wang group obtained a series of PROTAC molecules by connecting BI - 9321 with different E3 ligase ligands and then screened the degradation activities of NSD3 . 257 They found that 150 ( MS9715 , Fig . 36 ) had the best NSD3 degradation activity with DC 50 of 4 . 9 µM and D max of greater than 80 % in MOLM - 13 cells . After quantitative proteomic analysis , it was found that 150 ( MS9715 ) was highly selective and had no degradation activity on other proteins . In addition , 150 ( MS9715 ) could effectively inhibit the expression of NSD3 and cMyc - related genes , while the corresponding inhibitor BI - 9321 did not have this function . Fig . 37 The representative PROTACs targeting PRC2 ( EZH2 , EED ) Fig . 38 The representative PROTAC targeting PRMT5 PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 28 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 PRC2 ( EZH2 , EED ) . The polycomb repressive complex 2 ( PRC2 ) is an epigenetic modulator of transcription , which is mainly constituted of four subunits : EZH1 / 2 ( enhancer of the zeste homolog 1 / 2 ) , EED ( embryonic ectoderm development ) , SUZ12 ( suppressor of the zeste 12 protein homolog ) , and RbAp46 / RbAp48 ( retinoblastoma ( Rb ) - associated proteins 46 / 48 ) . 258 It catalyzes methylation of H3K27 . The trimethylation of H3K27 ( H3K27me3 ) is a transcriptionally repressive epigenetic mark that regulates gene expression , and hyper - trimethylation of H3K27 can be observed in several types of tumors . EZH2 is the catalyst subunit of PRC2 and mutation will be happened in several cancers , such as DLBCL . 259 EPZ6438 is a selective EZH2 inhibitor approved for epithelioid sarcoma . 260 In fact , EZH2 also mediates transcrip - tional activation independent of EZH2 / PRC2 catalytic activity in some cancers . In 2019 , Bloeche group reported an EED degrader 151 ( Fig . 37 ) by conjugating a potent EED inhibitor MAK683 with VHL ligand . 261 The degrader 192 not only induced rapid degradation of EED but also EZH2 and SUZ12 within the PRC2 complex . It selectively inhibited the proliferation of PRC2 - dependent cancer cells . At the same time , James group reported that degrader 152 ( UNC6852 , Fig . 37 ) also reduced the protein level of EED ( DC 50 = 0 . 79 µM ) and EZH2 ( DC 50 = 0 . 3 µM ) on HeLa cells . 262 In summary , these data demonstrated that the degradation of the subunit of the PRC2 complex could cause the complex to lose its function , which was expected to be a method for PRC2 - mediated cancer treatment . In 2020 , Jin group utilized a hydrophobic tag to link an EZH2 inhibitor to generate the degrader targeting EZH2 . 263 The degrader 153 ( MS1943 , Fig . 37 ) could reduce EZH2 protein levels in MDA - MB - 468 cells at 5 µM and suppress the H3K27me3 mark . Compared with inhibitor , the degrader 153 ( MS1943 ) showed signi ﬁ cant inhibition on cell growth and induced cell death in TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo . Based on a clinical EZH2 inhibitor EPZ6438 and pomalidomide , Yu group developed the degrader 154 ( E7 , Fig . 37 ) which induced degradation ef ﬁ cacies of all PRC subunits ( EZH2 72 % , SUZ12 81 % , EED 75 % , RbAp48 74 % ) at 1 µM in WSU - DLCL - 2 cells . 264 The degrader 154 ( E7 ) also displayed stronger anticancer abilities than EPZ6438 in WSU - DLCL - 2 cells and SWI / SNF - mutant cancer cells . In 2021 , Wen group reported a series of degraders with VHL ligands . The degrader 155 ( YM181 , Fig . 37 ) induced the degradation of 50 % EZH2 protein level at 1 μ M , and the degradation could be detected at 2 h . 265 It showed superior antiproliferative effects against lymphoma cell lines . PRMT5 . The PRMT family is a group of enzymes that can modify the nitrogen atom of the arginine guanidine group with monomethyl and dimethyl groups . Nine members have been found in mammals . According to the different methylation products , PRMTs can be divided into type I and type II . Both type I and type II enzymes can catalyze the production of monomethylated modi ﬁ cation . The difference is that type I can further catalyze the production of asymmetric dimethylarginine ( aDMA ) , while type II catalyzes the formation of symmetric dimethylarginine ( sDMA ) . PRMT5 is the ﬁ rst type II methyltrans - ferase to be isolated as a JAK2 binding protein . 266 Over - expression of PRMT5 leads to infectious diseases , heart diseases , and cancers ( such as breast , lung , and liver can - cer ) . 267 – 269 In 2020 , Jin group developed a degrader 156 ( MS4322 , Fig . 38 ) conjugated with the PRMT5 inhibitor EPZ015666 and VHL ligand through a PEG linker . 270 As the ﬁ rst - in - class PRMT5 degrader , 156 ( MS4322 ) induced the ef ﬁ cient degradation of PRMT5 in MCF - 7 cells with the DC 50 and D max value of 1 . 1 µM and 74 % , respectively . The antiproliferative activity of the degrader 156 ( MS4322 ) ( IC 50 = 18 nM ) was better than EPZ015666 ( IC 50 = 30 nM ) in MV4 - 11 cells . Moreover , it was highly selective for PRMT5 by proteomic study and exhibited good plasma exposure in mice . So the degrader 156 ( MS4322 ) was a valuable chemical tool for exploring the PRMT5 functions in disease . SIRT2 . Sirtuins protein is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD + ) dependent histone deacetylase . 271 There are seven recognized members in the human sirtuin family : SIRT1 - SIRT7 , all of which have highly conserved NAD binding domains and catalytic functional domains . The sirtuin protein family can regulate the acetylation modi ﬁ cation and ADP ribosyl modi ﬁ ca - tion of a variety of proteins . SIRT2 is mainly distributed in the cytoplasm and is particularly important for the growth and metabolism of tumor cells , which makes SIRT2 an attractive target for cancer treatment . 272 Fig . 39 The representative PROTAC targeting SIRT2 Fig . 40 The representative PROTACs targeting WDR5 PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 29 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 In 2020 , Lin group developed a SIRT2 degrader 157 ( TM - P4 - Thal , Fig . 39 ) conjugated with the thiomyristoyl lysine - based SIRT2 selective inhibitor TM and CRBN ligand through a PEG linker . 273 The degrader 157 ( TM - P4 - Thal ) successfully induced the degradation of SHP2 at 0 . 5 µM in MCF - 7 cells , which led to simultaneous inhibition of its deacetylase and defatty - acylase activities in living cells . WDR5 . The chromatin - associated WD40 repeat domain protein 5 ( WDR5 ) acts as a functional subunit of the mixed lineage leukemia ( MLL ) histone methyltransferase complexes . WDR5 is critical for the methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 ( H3K4 ) on chromatin catalyzed by the MLL1 complex and MLL1 complex - mediated regulations of gene transcription . 274 Numerous studies have identi ﬁ ed WDR5 as a promising potential ther - apeutic target . Efforts on targeting the WIN or WBM binding site of WDR5 have led to discovery of several inhibitors that potently and selectively block PPIs between WDR5 and its binding partners . 275 However , these WDR5 PPI inhibitors rely on receptor occupancy pharmacology and target only some but not all WDR5 oncogenic functions , exerting poor antiproliferative activity on tumor cells . 276 In 2021 , Knapp group reported different WDR5 degraders based on two diverse WIN site binding scaffolds ( OICR - 9429 modi ﬁ ed scaffold and pyrroloimidazole modi ﬁ ed scaffold ) and different E3 ligase ligands . 277 In MV4 - 11 cells , OICR - 9429 modi ﬁ ed scaffold derived degrader 158 ( Fig . 40 ) induced the degradation of WDR5 of 58 % with a DC 50 value of 53 nM , and pyrroloimidazole modi ﬁ ed scaffold derived degrader 159 ( Fig . 40 ) induced the degradation of WDR5 of 53 % with a DC 50 value of 1 . 24 µM . In the same year , Jin group also reported the WDR5 degraders based on OICR - 9429 and VHL ligase ligands . 278 Firstly , they designed WDR5 degrader 160 ( MS33 , Fig . 40 ) and found it could induce the degradation of WDR5 with DC 50 of 260 nM . Subsequently , they used the degrader 160 ( MS33 ) successfully resolve the structure of the VHL - MS33 - WDR5 ternary complex . Based on the crystal structure , they modi ﬁ ed the OICR - 9429 ligand and shortened the linker to obtain a new WDR5 degrader 161 ( MS67 , Fig . 40 ) . They found that the degrader 161 ( MS67 ) could quickly induce the degradation of WDR5 with DC 50 of 3 . 7 nM , which was about 70 - folds higher than the degrader 160 ( MS33 ) . At the same time , they also resolved the structure of the VHL - MS67 - WDR5 ternary complex . Subsequently , the antiproli - ferative activity of the degrader 161 ( MS67 ) was tested on a variety of AML cells , which showed that it had good anti - proliferation activity . In addition , it inhibited the malignant growth of MLL - r AML cells in vitro and in vivo . Cell cycle - related protein Aurora A . Aurora kinases are serine / threonine protein kinases that regulate centrosome and microtubule functions during mitosis . They are mainly divided into three subtypes : Aurora A , Aurora B , and Aurora C . Aurora A and Aurora B are essential for the cell cycle progression of most cell types and Aurora C mainly distributes in testis . 279 Aurora A kinase is related to centrosome replication and mitotic exit . When Aurora A kinase is inhibited , it can effectively cause cell mitosis to arrest in the G2 / M phase and quickly induce apoptosis . 280 Aurora B kinase plays a role in coordinating the function of chromosomes and cytoskeleton in the cell cycle . When Aurora B kinase is inhibited , the cytoplasm of the cell cannot be divided and cell growth is arrested . 281 Since both Aurora A and Aurora B kinases are related to tumorigenesis , Aurora kinase inhibitors have been extensively carried out in clinical researches on various diseases , such as lung cancer , breast cancer , esophageal cancer , colorectal cancer , acute myeloid leukemia and so on , but currently no drugs have been approved for clinical use . The Wolf group reported the ﬁ rst selective Aurora A degrader 162 ( JB170 , Fig . 41 ) in 2020 based on the inhibitor alisertib ( MLN8237 ) , 282 which had a known binding mode and high binding af ﬁ nity with Aurora A kinase and easy derivation . They Fig . 41 The representative PROTACs targeting Aurora A Fig . 42 The representative PROTAC targeting Cdc20 PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 30 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 found that degrader 162 ( JB170 ) had strong binding ability and degradation activity to Aurora A kinase , its degradation activity was signi ﬁ cantly better than that of other designed molecules , and it had a D max of 300 nM and a DC 50 of 28 nM for Aurora A kinase . After MV4 - 11 cells were treated with degrader 162 ( JB170 ) or alisertib , degrader 162 ( JB170 ) reduced the level of Aurora A by 73 % , which was 57 % lower than alisertib . And among the 4259 proteins detectable in this experiment , no other proteins were downregulated , including Aurora B . Subsequently , they found that degrader 162 ( JB170 ) only induced cell accumulation in S phase , which was different with alisertib that induced the G2 / M phase arrest of cells . They speculated this may be due to the fact that degrader 162 ( JB170 ) had regulated the non - enzymatic activity of Aurora A . In order to study the effect of degrader 162 ( JB170 ) on the proliferation activity of cancer cells , they used degrader 162 ( JB170 ) to treat MV4 - 11 cells . The MV4 - 11 cells were inhibited by 32 % after 72 h of treatment with 1 µM of JB170 . Similar results were observed in the colony formation assay using IMR5 cells . Fischer group reported the second case of selective Aurora A degrader 163 ( dAURK - 4 , Fig . 41 ) in 2021 , 283 which was also based on alisertib as the target protein ligand . They veri ﬁ ed the degradation activity by western blot in the MM . 1S multiple myeloma cell line , and also proved that the antiproliferative activity of degrader 163 ( dAURK - 4 ) in the MM . 1S multiple myeloma cell line was signi ﬁ cantly better than that of the inhibitor alisertib . Lindon group reported the third Aurora A degrader 164 ( PROTAC - D , Fig . 41 ) in 2021 . 284 They veri ﬁ ed its degradation activity on Aurora A in the U2OS cell lines and also proved that it did not induce Aurora B kinase degradation . At the subcellular level , they found that the distribution of Aurora A on the spindle was different from that of the centrosome . Therefore , the therapeutic phenotypic result of degrader 164 ( PROTAC - D ) was different from the result mediated by alisertib . At the same time , they also con ﬁ rmed that in intermitotic cells , degrader 164 ( PROTAC - D ) mediated the degradation of Aurora A in the non - centrosome , but had no effect on the level of Aurora A in the centrosome . Cdc20 . The cell - division cycle protein 20 ( Cdc20 ) is the substrate receptor of anaphase synthesis complex or cyclosome ( APC / C ) . It coordinates late initiation and exit of mitosis through safety and time - dependent degradation . 285 Cdc20 is a key mitotic factor , which controls the beginning of anaphase and the exit of mitosis . Moreover , Cdc20 - APC / C plays a key role in cancer progression and drug resistance . Furthermore , Cdc20 - APC / C cell processes beyond the cell cycle , including apoptosis , neurogenesis , stem cell expansion . 286 Meanwhile , it has a strong connection between the aberrant upregulation of Cdc20 and various types of cancers . Cdc20 is a potential biomarker and an ideal target for cancer treatment . 287 In 2019 , Wan group described the ﬁ rst Cdc20 degrader 165 ( CP5V , Fig . 42 ) . 288 The degrader 165 ( CP5V ) induced the degradation of Cdc20 resulted in signi ﬁ cant inhibition of breast cancer cell proliferation and resensitization of paclitaxel - resistant cell lines . The degrader 165 ( CP5V ) played an important role in inhibiting the progression of breast tumors . In cultured cells and preclinical breast cancer models , it induced the degradation of Cdc20 to induce mitosis inhibition , thereby inhibiting cancer cell proliferation . As a result , it played an important role in inhibiting breast cancer tumor progression in vivo . CP5V - induced degrada - tion of Cdc20 may be an effective treatment strategy for breast cancer anti - mitotic therapy . CDK2 . Inactivation of cyclin - dependent kinase 2 ( CDK2 ) , which overcomes the differentiation arrest of acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) cells , maybe a promising approach for the treatment of AML . 289 – 291 However , there are no available selective CDK2 inhibitors . 292 , 293 In 2020 , Chen group used AT - 7519 as the CDK2 targeting ligand connected to CRBN ligand through different linkers to obtain a series of degraders . 294 They found the degrader 166 ( 9A , Fig . 43 ) had a good selective degradation of CDK2 through activity screening . And it had no effect on CDK5 and CDK9 . Subsequently , the degrader 166 ( 9A ) showed good inhibitory activity against cell proliferation with IC 50 of 0 . 84 µM in PC - 3 cells . In 2021 , Rao group developed a ﬁ rst - in - class CDK2 degrader 167 ( CPS2 , Fig . 43 ) by conjugating a CRBN ligand and a nonselective CDK2 ligand JNJ - 7706621 . 295 The degrader 167 ( CPS2 ) induced the rapid and potent degradation of CDK2 in different cell lines without comparable degradation of other targets , and induced remarkable differentiation of AML cell lines and primary patient cells . These data clearly demonstrated the practicality and importance of PROTACs as alternative tools for verifying CDK2 protein functions . Also in the same year , Zuo group reported the another CDK2 degrader 168 ( PROTAC - 8 , Fig . 43 ) based on AZD5438 and VH032 . 296 They found the degrader 168 ( PROTAC - 8 ) could selectively induce the degradation of CDK2 protein . The DC 50 was about 100 nM to CDK2 while no degradation activity for other Fig . 44 The representative PROTAC targeting CDK2 / 5 Fig . 43 The representative PROTACs targeting CDK2 PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 31 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 subtypes of CDK protein . They also found that it could be used to prevent and treat cisplatin ototoxicity and excitotoxicity of kainic acid in zebra ﬁ sh . It the ﬁ rst report that CDK2 degrader could be used to prevent and treat acquired hearing loss . CDK2 / 5 . In 2020 , Gray group modi ﬁ ed the structure of a pan - CDK inhibitor TMX - 2039 to obtain a compound TMX - 3010 that increased the selectivity for CDK1 / 2 / 5 , but still had a certain constant activity on CDK4 / 6 ( IC 50 ≈ 100 nM ) . 297 TMX - 3010 improved the selectivity to CDK1 / 2 / 5 , possibly because the linker moiety signi ﬁ cantly impaired the inhibitory activity on CDK4 and CDK6 . Based on TMX - 3010 , they developed a selective degrader 169 ( TMX - 2172 , Fig . 44 ) for CDK2 and CDK5 over other CDKs . In OVCAR8 cells , the degrader 169 ( TMX - 2172 ) selectively induced the degradation of CDK2 and CDK5 in a time and dose - dependent manner , while having no in ﬂ uence on other CDKs . Although CDK5 deletion did not cause growth defects in OVCAR8 cells , a more selective CDK2 degrader was in urgent need of development . CDK2 / 4 / 6 . CDK4 and CDK6 are a family of serine - threonine kinases that interact with cyclins to phosphorylate Rb , thereby regulating the G1 / S transition of the cell cycle . Phosphorylation of Rb leads to the release of the transcription factor E2F to activate many transcription genes that are responsible for cell cycle progression . 298 Among CDKs , CDK4 / 6 play an important role in the cell cycle and are often overexpressed or overactivated in tumor samples . 299 However , the current clinical use of CDK4 / 6 inhibitors have limited its application due to its drug resistance and off - target effects . 300 So far , many selective and nonselective degraders of CDK4 / 6 have been reported . 301 – 306 Here , we make a supplement to the CDK4 / 6 degraders reported in recent 2 years . In 2021 , Dominici group reported their work on the Fig . 45 The representative PROTACs targeting CDK2 / 4 / 6 Fig . 46 The representative PROTACs targeting CDK9 PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 32 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 development of selective CDK6 degraders . 307 The results showed that the degradation of CDK6 was more effective than inhibition with the dual CDK4 / 6 inhibitor Palbociclib in suppressing Ph - positive ALL in mice , suggesting that the growth - promoting effects were CDK6 kinase - independent in Ph - positive ALL . The most effective degrader 170 ( YX - 2 - 107 , Fig . 45 ) induced the rapid and selective degradation of CDK6 over CDK4 in Ph - positive ALL cells , and signi ﬁ cantly inhibited S - phase cells and inhibited the expression of phosphor - RB and FoxM1 regulated by CDK6 . The degrader 170 ( YX - 2 - 107 ) showed good antitumor effects in Ph - positive ALL xenografts and it had a good safety window . However , it was fast metabolized in mice with a t 1 / 2 of 1 h , suggesting that further improvement in PK parameters was warranted . In addition to CRBN and MDM2 ligands , the VHL and cIPA ligands have also successfully been utilized in PROTAC for the degradation of CDK4 / 6 . In 2020 , Kronke group designed and generated series of VHL and cIPA - based CDK4 / 6 degraders . 308 The VHL - based degraders were either speci ﬁ c degradation for CDK6 or exhibited dual degradation for CDK4 and CDK6 . The most representative degrader 171 ( Fig . 45 ) was a selective CDK6 degrader with the DC 50 value of 5 . 1 nM and D max more than 95 % in MM . 1S cells . However , cIAP - based degraders induced a combined degradation of CDK4 / 6 and IAPs resulted in synergistic effects on cancer cell growth . In conclusion , the results showed that VHL and cIAP - based degraders were an attractive approach for targeted degradation of CDK4 / 6 in cancer . A growing number of reports indicated that inhibitors targeting CDK2 / 4 / 6 could act as a more feasible chemotherapy strategy . In 2021 , Wei group developed a degrader 172 ( Fig . 45 ) based on Ribociclib derivative . The degrader 172 could selectively induce the degradation of CDK2 / 4 / 6 over other CDKs . 309 It also showed reduced protein levels of CDK2 / 4 / 6 in a dose and time - dependent manner as well as inhibition of the retinoblastoma ( Rb ) protein phosphorylation in malignant melanoma cells . Moreover , it also remarkably induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of melanoma cells . However , the degrader 172 showed poor oral bioavailability . By adding a labile group to the degrader 172 they got the new degrader 173 ( Fig . 45 ) , whose oral bioavailability signi ﬁ cantly increased up to 68 % . In B16F10 xenograft model , oral adminis - tration ( 200 mg / kg ) of the degrader 173 showed a signi ﬁ cant reduction in tumor growth . This may also provide a universal solution for oral CRBN - based degraders . CDK9 . Cyclin - dependent kinases ( CDKs ) are a class of Ser / Thr protein kinases that have key roles in cell cycle regulation or cell transcription . 310 CDK9 is a member of the family of CDKs and is crucial in transcription regulation that regulates most of the cancer suppressors and oncogenes . 311 It overexpressed in a variety of tumors such as leukemia and malignant melanoma . CDK9 inhibitors can inhibit the kinase activity and phosphoryla - tion of CDK9 , thereby preventing P - TEFb - mediated activation of RNA Pol II , and inhibiting gene transcription of many anti - apoptotic proteins . 312 Although a large amount of data indicates that CDK9 is a promising target for cancer treatment , the development of highly selective CDK9 inhibitors is still a huge challenge . Indiscriminate inhibition of CDK family kinase activity can cause adverse side effects and undesirable toxicity . 313 In recent years , some examples of selective CDK9 degrader have been reported . In 2017 , Rana group reported the ﬁ rst CDK9 degrader by conjugating a CDK9 inhibitor Nopyrazole and thalidomide . The degrader could potently induce 56 % CDK9 to degrade at 10 μ M , which was not enough for tumor treatment . 314 Recently , Natarajan group reported a similar degrader 174 ( Fig . 46 ) with better degradation activity by changing the length of linker . The degrader 174 could selectively induce degradation of CDK9 with DC 50 of 158 nM while sparing other CDK family members . 315 These results indicated that the length of the linker was important for degradation activity and selectivity of CDK9 . In 2021 , Bian group reported a selective degrader 175 ( B03 , Fig . 46 ) for CDK9 by conjugating a selective CDK9 inhibitor BAY - 1143572 and pomalidomide . 316 The degrader 175 ( B03 ) induced the degradation of CDK9 in acute myeloid leukemia cells with DC 50 of 7 . 6 nM , which was superior to the reported CDK9 degraders . In addition , the degrader 175 ( B03 ) strongly induced apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation of MV4 - 11 cells ( IC 50 = 25 nM ) , which was better than the inhibitor BAY - 1143572 ( IC 50 = 560 nM ) . Moreover , the degrader 175 ( B03 ) could induce the degradation of CDK9 in vivo . It was the lead degrader of further development and CDK9 degradation was a potentially valuable treatment strategy for acute myeloid leukemia . Based on the previous results and through the analysis of the CDK9 ligands binding modes , Chen group also designed and developed a series of new CDK9 protein degraders in the same year . 294 They found the degrader 176 ( PROTAC 45 , Fig . 46 ) had better activity in inhibiting the growth of TNBC cells , the DC 50 reached up to 4 nM in BT - 549 cells . And the degrader 176 ( PROTAC 45 ) could effectively and selectively induce degrada - tion of CDK9 in a short period of time . In addition , mechanistic studies have shown that the degrader 176 ( PROTAC 45 ) could effectively downregulate the downstream targets of CDK9 ( such as MCL1 and MYC ) at the transcriptional level . Pharmacodynamic studies have shown that the degrader 176 ( PROTAC 45 ) could effectively induce tumor regression in a TNBC xenograft model . This was the ﬁ rst reported in vivo evaluation of the therapeutic Fig . 47 The representative PROTACs targeting CDK12 Fig . 48 The representative PROTAC targeting Wee1 PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 33 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 activity of CDK9 degrader in the treatment of TNBC , which proved that CDK9 degradation therapy was a new method for the treatment of TNBC . In 2020 , Chen group ﬁ rst developed a series of novel degraders for CDK2 / 9 degradation by connecting CDK9 inhibitor FN - 1501 and CRBN ligand . 317 The representative degrader 177 ( Fig . 46 ) potently induced degradation of both CDK2 ( DC 50 = 62 nM ) and CDK9 ( DC 50 = 33 nM ) in PC - 3 cells , and inhibited cell proliferation by effectively blocking the cell cycle in S and G2 / M phases . The degradation of CDK2 / 9 by dual PROTAC may be a potentially effective therapeutic approach . CDK12 . CDK12 can phosphorylate RNA polymerase II to regulate transcription elongation , and it can also play a key role in RNA splicing , DNA - damage response ( DDR ) and the maintenance of genome stability . 318 , 319 It is overexpressed in breast cancer , ovarian cancer , prostate cancer and other cancers , and is a valuable target for cancer valuable . 318 Loss of CDK12 function by silencing and using selective covalent CDK12 / 13 inhibitor THZ531 leads to a decrease in DDR - associated genes transcription and increases sensitivity to PARP inhibitors and platinum chemother - apy . Thus , CDK12 inhibitors can be used in combination with DNA damaging agents for HR - de ﬁ cient cancers . 320 , 321 However , the development of CDK12 inhibitors is particularly challenging due to high sequence similarity with its close homolog CDK13 . 322 In 2021 , Gray group developed a selective CDK12 degrader 178 ( BSJ - 4 - 116 , Fig . 47 ) by linking piperidine moiety of optimized segment to thalidomide . 323 As expected , the degrader 178 ( BSJ - 4 - 116 ) demonstrated strong inhibitory activity on CDK12 enzyme activity and effectively induced the degradation of CDK12 in a dose and time - dependent manner in Jurkat cells , while CDK13 protein levels were minimally affected . Moreover , it exhibited potent antiproliferative effects when used alone or in combination with the PARP Olaparib as well as used alone against cell lines that resistant to covalent CDK12 inhibitors . Interestingly , chronic exposure of degrader 178 ( BSJ - 4 - 116 ) to MOLT - 4 cells and Jurkat cells resulted in acquired resistance phenotypes via mutations of Ile733Val and Gly739Ser on CDK12 which resulted in the weaken of degrader binding af ﬁ nity . Then Zhu group synthesized a potent PROTAC 179 ( PP - C8 , Fig . 47 ) based on CDK12 / 13 noncovalent dual inhibitor SR - 4835 . 324 They demonstrated that the degrader 179 ( PP - C8 ) could selectively induce the degradation of CDK12 , while there is no degradation activity on CDK13 in different cell lines . And they also found that the degrader could lead to the degradation of cyclin K , and the degradation activity DC 50 for CDK12 and cyclin K were 416 and 412 nM , respectively . They also proved the degrader 179 ( PP - C8 ) was highly selective to CDK12 - cyclin K complex by quantitative proteomics . They have also shown that 179 ( PP - C8 ) and PARP inhibitors exhibited good synergy in triple - negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) . Wee1 . Wee1 is a tyrosine kinase that regulates the G2 / M cell cycle checkpoint by phosphorylating and inactivating CDK1 in response to extrinsic DNA damage and errors in DNA synthesis , thereby preventing mitotic entry . 325 Cancer cells often have a de ﬁ cient G1 / S checkpoint which frequently via mutation of p53 to leave them reliant on the G2 / M checkpoint to avoid mitotic catastrophe . Therefore , abrogation of the G2 / M checkpoint by inhibiting Wee1 can sensitize tumors to DNA damaging therapies . In previous studies , Wee1 inhibitor AZD1775 has been discov - ered . 326 However , it has obvious off - target and side effects , which limits its clinical application . In 2019 , in an attempt to overcome these limitations , Gray group developed Wee1 degraders by conjugating AZD1775 to pomalidomide . 327 The degrader 180 ( ZNL - 02 - 096 , Fig . 48 ) displayed potent Wee1 degradation in MOLT - 4 cells while having no in ﬂ uence on PLK1 . In addition , it induced G2 / M phase arrest at 10 folds lower doses than AZD1775 and synergized with Olaparib in ovarian cancer cells . UPS - related protein CRBN . The cereblon ( CRBN ) is a subunit of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex cullin - RING ligase 4 ( CRL4 CRBN ) and is the substrate receptor for the damaged DNA binding protein 1 ( DDB1 ) and Cul4A . 328 , 329 CRBN is also the direct target protein of thalidomide and immunomodulatory imide drugs ( IMiDs ) and is crucial for thalidomide teratogenicity . 330 CRL4 CRBN is a unique E3 ubiquitin ligase with substrate selectivity altered by ligands such as IMiDs . 331 It can be ef ﬁ ciently recruited to a protein of interest ( POI ) when binding with IMiD - based proteolysis - targeting chi - meras ( PROTACs ) , leading to the protein ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation . 332 As the primary IMiD target , CRBN is a protein of huge potential practice . 333 CRBN degraders are Fig . 49 The representative PROTACs targeting CRBN PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 34 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 considered to be useful tools to ﬁ gure out the molecular mechanism of thalidomide analogs 334 . In 2018 , Gu ̈ tschow group designed a series of PROTACs that targeted CRBN for the ﬁ rst time , proving the feasibility of a degrader - induced degradation of CRBN . 330 They synthesized so - called homo - ROTACs by linking the two pomalidomide molecules . They found the degrader 181 ( Fig . 49 ) could selectively induce the degradation of CRBN with minimal effects to other related proteins such as IKZF1 , IKZF3 and CRL4 . The maximum degrada - tion activity of CRBN was achieved at 6h after treatment with 100 nM degrader 181 . The homo - PROTACs could overcome the low selectivity of traditional chemical probes and also provide a new tool for exploring the mechanism of CRBN and IMiDs . Subsequently , they also reported several hetero - PROTACs by assembling CRBN and VHL in 2019 . One of the particularly potent CRBN degrader 182 ( CRBN - 6 - 5 - 5 - VHL , Fig . 49 ) had the best degradation activity of CRBN with DC 50 of 1 . 5 nM in MM1S cells . 334 Compared with the degrader 181 , hetero - PROTACs such as CRBN - 6 - 5 - 5 - VHL , CRBN - 6 - 6 - 6 - VHL and CRBN - 4 - 4 - 4 - 6 - VHL all could achieve more ef ﬁ cient degradation activities of CRBN while inducing almost negligible degradation of the neo - substrates IKZF1 and IKZF3 . In 2019 , Ciulli group reported their most active VHL - CRBN hetero - dimerizing degrader 183 ( Fig . 49 ) which induced the rapid and ef ﬁ cient degradation of CRBN with a DC 50 of 200 nM in HeLa cells ( within 1 h of treatment ) . Their work provided proof - of - concept for hijacking different E3 ligase to induce degradation of a particular one . 335 Subsequently , Kim group developed a series of VHL - CRBN hetero - dimerizing degraders which effectively induced degrada - tion of CRBN but not VHL . 336 To develop VHL - CRBN hetero - dimerizing PROTACs they designed different linkers to connect pomalidomide with VH032 . The linkers were designed to connect the amino group of pomalidomide and the terminal acetyl group of VH032 . The most potent and selective degrader 184 ( TD - 165 , Fig . 49 ) could induce the degradation of CRBN with DC 50 of 20 . 4 nM in HEK293T cells . Recently , Gray group developed six homo - PROTACs and six hetero - PROTACs adopting a similar strategy as the previous ones . By combining protein immunology and genomics analysis , they successfully screened out two effective hetero - PROTACs which could selectively induce the degradation of CRBN , which provids a reference for follow - up research . The degradation ef ﬁ ciency of degrader 185 ( ZXH - 4 - 130 , Fig . 49 ) and degrader 186 ( ZXH - 4 - 137 , Fig . 49 ) were better than degrader 183 and degrader 184 ( TD - 165 ) . 337 hRpn13 Pru . The 26S proteasome consists of a 20S core and a 19S regulatory subunit . hRpn13 is a component of the 19S subunit , which contains two functional domains , an N - terminal pleckstrin - like receptor for ubiquitin ( Pru ) domain and a C - terminal deubi - quitinase adaptor ( DEUBAD ) domain . 338 – 340 In 2021 , Walters group screened an inhibitor XL5 with better binding ability based on the reported structure of hRpn13 inhibitor RA190 . 341 On the basis of XL15 , they used different E3 ligase ligands to connect with it to obtain a series of PROTAC molecules . They found that 187 ( XL5 - VHL - 2 , Fig . 50 ) was able to induce the degradation of DEUBAD - lacking hRpn13 Pru species in RPMI - 8226 wild - type cells , but not hRpn13 . The degradation activity of DEUBAD - lacking hRpn13 Pru species was DC 50 of 39 µM and D max of 81 % . When treated with 187 ( XL5 - VHL - 2 ) , it only resulted in ubiquitination of hRpn13 protein without degradation . VHL . E3 ubiquitin ligases are emerging as attractive targets for small - molecule modulation and drug discovery and gaining importance as targets to small molecules , both for direct inhibition and to be hijacked to induce the degradation of non - native neo - substrates using bivalent compounds known as PROTACs . 342 However , E3 ligases do not comprise deep and “ druggable ” active sites for binding to small molecules . E3 ligase inhibition may be ineffective or fail to recapitulate genetic knockout or knock - down . 343 New chemical modalities to target E3 ligases are therefore demanded . In 2017 , Ciulli group described proof - of - concept of homo - PROTACs using diverse molecules composed of two instances of a ligand for the VHL E3 ligase . 344 The most active degrader 188 ( CM11 , Fig . 51 ) dimerized VHL with high avidity in vitro and induced potent , rapid , and proteasome - dependent self - Fig . 50 The representative PROTAC targeting hRpn13 Pru Fig . 51 The representative PROTAC targeting VHL Fig . 52 The representative PROTAC targeting ZFP91 PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 35 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 degradation of VHL in different cell lines , in a highly isoform - selective fashion and without triggering a hypoxic response . As a novel chemical probe for selective VHL degradation , the degrader 188 ( CM11 ) would ﬁ nd wide use in investigating and dissecting the biological functions of pVHL . ZFP91 . ZFP91 is a newly discovered ubiquitin E3 ligase that is upregulated in prostate cancer , acute myeloid leukemia , and colon cancer tumors . It maintains the stability of NIK protein through K63 - ubiquitinated NIK , thereby activating the NF - κ B signaling pathway and promoting the occurrence and develop - ment of tumors . 345 In 2021 , Neamati group designed a ZFP91 degrader 189 ( XD2 - 149 , Fig . 52 ) based on Napabucasin , which was undergoing multiple clinical trials and was reported to inhibit STAT3 , and the degrader 189 ( XD2 - 149 ) resulted in inhibition of STAT3 signaling in pancreatic cancer cell lines without inducing proteasome - dependent degradation of STAT3 . 346 Proteomics analysis showed that it could induce the degradation of the E3 ubiquitinprotein ligase ZFP91 with DC 50 values of 80 nM in BxPC - 3 cells . At the same time , it also showed a moderate antiproliferative activity , and the IC 50 was about 0 . 9 µM in MIA PaCa - 2 cells and BxPC - 3 cells . Other proteins BTK . As a key regulator in the B - cell receptor ( BCR ) signaling pathway , BTK is a non - receptor cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase and plays a key role in B - cell lymphomas . 347 In 2013 , although the covalent inhibitor ibrutinib was approved for treating MCL and activated B - cell - like ( ABC ) - DLBCL by FDA , the patients developed resistance due to the missense BTK mutation of C481S . 348 With the advent of PROTACs technology , there have been many non - covalent degraders which can degrade both the wild - type and ibrutinib - resistant C481S BTK effectively . 349 – 353 The next stage may be aimed at improving druggability for a clinical study . In 2019 , Lin group developed a new BTK degrader 190 ( SPB5208 , Fig . 53 ) by conjugating Ibrutinib and thalidomide . 354 The degrader 190 ( SPB5208 ) could inhibit the growth of the JeKo - Fig . 53 The representative PROTACs targeting BTK Table 6 .

He et al . 36 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 1 cells and induce the degradation of BTK protein both in vitro and in vivo . In 2020 , Crews group illustrated a new series of BTK degraders based on MT802 which was reported previously with potent degradation activity of BTK and poor pharmacokinetic properties . To develop an appropriate degrader for in vivo study , they modi ﬁ ed the linker and E3 ligands while keeping their length constant . Fortunately , the degrader 191 ( SJF620 , Fig . 53 ) exhibited both potent degradation activity and encouraging pharmacokinetic pro ﬁ le . 355 In 2021 , Wang group designed a novel series of PROTACs targeting BTK based on ARQ531 , a reversible noncovalent BTK inhibitor that inhibits both wild - type ( WT ) and mutated BTK . In addition to having moderate membrane permeability and good plasma stability , the most potent degrader 192 ( Fig . 53 ) also could induce the degradation of BTK WT / BTK C481S and inhibit BTK WT / BTK C481S TMD8 cells growth effectively . 356 In 2021 , Rao group developed a new type degrader of targeted protein degradation by merging PROTAC and molecular glue for inducing the degradation of BTK and GSPT1 proteins concurrently . They designed a BTK PROTACs library with short linkers to keep the balance of the ef ﬁ ciency of PROTACs and the features of molecular glue . 357 The representative degrader 193 ( GBD - 9 , Fig . 53 ) induced the fast and effective degradation of BTK and GSPT1 in DOHH2 cells and exhibited more potent antiproliferative activity than Ibrutinib on a variety of DLBCL and AML cell lines . This work not only provided a new example for the design of double - mechanism degraders with the characteristics of molecu - lar glue and PROTACs , but also expanded the indications of PROTACs targeting BTK , which may have broader clinical application prospects . In 2021 , P ﬁ zer solved the unique BTK - degrader - cIAP1 ternary complex crystal structure by using the degrader 195 ( BC5P , Fig . 53 ) which was derived from aminopyrazole series in previous work and it was shown that BTK was ﬂ exibly tethered to cIAP1 with a multitude of sampled conformations . To restrict this ﬂ exibility , a shorter and more rigid linker was induced to obtain the degrader 194 ( BCPyr , Fig . 53 ) which enhanced protein – protein interactions , restricted conformational dynamics but weakened BTK - degradation activities . This indicated that the cooperativity of ternary complex did not necessarily correlate with degradation activity . 358 Although Ibrutinib is an irreversible covalent inhibitor , most PROTACs targeting BTK are based on noncovalent binding . Certainly , there have been many attempts to design covalent PROTACs in recent years . In 2020 , Pan group illustrated a new class of BTK PROTACs based on an irreversible covalent binder . Although the degrader 196 ( Fig . 53 ) could induce the degradation of BTK protein with a DC 50 of 136 nM and a D max of 88 % , its potency was reduced due to the loss of substoichiometric activity . 359 In 2020 , Nir group 360 and Wang group 361 successively reported reversible covalent BTK PROTACs which enhanced the binding af ﬁ nity of inhibitor without compromising the substoichiometric activity of PROTACs . Coincidentally , they both developed reversible covalent PROTACs based on cyanoacrylamide . Interestingly , in Wang work , the reversible covalent degrader 197 ( RC - 1 , Fig . 53 ) had high target occupancy and worked as both an inhibitor and a degrader which exhibited more potent degradation activity of BTK WT and BTK C481S than the equivalent irreversible covalent and reversible noncovalent degrader . Conversely , the degrader 198 ( RC - 3 , Fig . 53 ) was the best reversible covalent BTK PROTACs in Nir work , even less potent than the equivalent irreversible covalent and reversible noncovalent degrader . But Nir work mainly illustrated the molecular mechanism that part of the degradation by irreversible covalent PROTACs was driven by reversible binding prior to covalent bond formation , while the reversible covalent PROTACs drave degradation primarily by covalent engagement . Finally , the authors compared the reported BTK degraders ( Table 6 ) . It was found that although there were various types of BTK warheads currently used , Ibrutinib was used more frequently and others were used less . In the selection of E3 ligases , most of the currently used was CRBN , and VHL and cIAP have been mentioned in some reports . Therefore , more BTK degraders based on different BTK inhibitors and E3 ligases need to be developed . CCR9 . CCR9 is a chemokine receptor expressed on memory / effector CD4 + T cells and selectively binds the chemokine CCL25 . 362 The expression of CCL25 is signi ﬁ cantly increased when the intestine is in ﬂ amed and drives lymphocyte migration to the intestinal tissue through interaction with CCR9 . It a treatment for Crohn disease to prevent the migration of lymphocytes to the intestinal tissue by inhibiting the interaction of CCR9 and CCL25 . Vercirnon is a small - molecule CCR9 - selective antagonist that binds to the CCR9 receptor on the intracellular side of the GPCR , but not on the extracellular side of the cell where GPCR ligands normally bind . 363 By binding to this allosteric site on the CCR9 receptor , Vercirnon prevents CCR9 from interacting with intracellular signaling molecules , thereby achieving an antagonistic effect . Based on the binding mode of Vercirnon and CCR9 , Schiedel group obtained a more active antagonist . 364 Based on the structure of the new antagonist , they designed a CCR9 - targeted degrader 199 ( CCR9 - PROTAC , Fig . 54 ) and then they tested the degradation activity of the degrader on CCR9 in HEK293T cells . They found the degrader 199 ( CCR9 - PROTAC ) could induce the degradation of CCR9 at 1 nM , but the “ hook effect ” also appeared as the concentration increased . This was the ﬁ rst PROTAC targeted the intracellular allosteric binding site of GPCRs and provided an unprecedented approach to modulate GPCR activity . Fig . 54 The representative PROTAC targeting CCR9 Fig . 55 The representative PROTAC targeting CD147 PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 37 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 CD147 . CD147 is a transmembrane glycoprotein , a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily . As a tumor - associated antigen , it is highly expressed in various tumors , including malignant melanoma ( MM ) . As a pivotal role in tumor progression , including affecting tumor cell apoptosis , invasion and metastasis . Therefore , CD147 may provide a potential drug target for tumor diagnosis and treatment . 365 To date , the anti - CD147 monoclonal antibody drug Licartin has been used in clinical treatment of liver cancer , but the radioactive I 130 contained in Licartin may have inconvenience and risk of radiation leakage in clinical application . 366 Pseudolaric acid B ( PAB ) , a recently reported natural product , was an antagonist of CD147 , which could avoid the above - mentioned problems . 367 So in 2020 , Chen group reported the ﬁ rst CRBN - based CD147 degrader 200 ( Fig . 55 ) derived from PAB . 368 The degrader 200 could effectively induce the degradation of CD147 with DC 50 of 6 . 72 µM in Sk - Mel - 28 cells and inhibited melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo . In summary , the degrader 200 as the novel type of anticancer agent provided a new method for CD147 - mediated cancer treatment . CRABP . Cytoplasmic retinoic acid - binding proteins , CRABP - I and CRABP - II , are found in all vertebrates and are conserved across species . CRABP - I is thought to be related to metabolism of retinoic acid ( RA ) and resistance to RA in cancer cells , while CRABP - II is suggested to be associated with nuclear transportation of RA . 369 CRABP - II is expressed in tissues such as the choroid plexus , gut endoderm , and interdigital mesenchyme , which do not express CRABP - I . 370 CRABP - I / II are related to Alzheimer disease and various cancer . 371 , 372 Therefore , CRABPs could be target proteins for treatment of these diseases . However , it is challenging to directly inhibit the functions of CRABPs by small molecules . In 2010 , Hashimoto group developed the ﬁ rst cIAP1 - based PROTAC by hijacking cIAP1 - E3 ligase ( bestatinmethyl ester , MeBS ) and all - trans retinoic acid ( ATRA ) to induce the degradation of CRABP - I / II . 373 Based on this work Naito group developed new class CRABPs degrader 201 ( β - NF - ATRA , Fig . 56 ) that used β - naphtho ﬂ avone ( β - NF ) as a ligand to replace the MeBS to recruit aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR ) E3 ligase complexes in 2019 . 374 The degrader 201 ( β - NF - ATRA ) could effectively induce the degradation of CRABP - I / II in a dose and time - dependent manner in MCF - 7 and IMR - 32 cells , and induced AhR self - ubiquitylation and was degraded by the proteasome , which may cause the potential for synergistic anti - tumorigenic activity . HSP90 . Heat shock protein 90 ( HSP90 ) is a ubiquitous , highly conserved and highly active protein in cells , which is more abundant in tumor cells than in normal cells . As a molecular chaperone , HSP90 assists different kinds of oncoproteins to fold , stabilize and mature . 375 The service proteins of HSP90 contain a large number of signal transduction molecules such as kinases and transcription factors , which play an important role in tumor formation and growth . 376 HSP90 inhibitors are a class of compounds that can bind to HSP90 - regulatory sites , cause conformational changes of HSP90 and induce degradation of substrate proteins , thereby exerting an inhibitory effect . 377 HSP90 inhibitors also can cause multiple signal transduction pathways of tumor cells to be inhibited . Many kinds of HSP90 inhibitors have entered the clinical phase . Wu group designed and synthesized a series of PROTACs based on the binding mode of HSP90 inhibitor BIIB021 to the protein . 378 Then they tested their degradation activity on HSP90 protein and proliferation inhibitory activity in MCF - 7 and MDA - MB - 231 cells , they found the degrader 202 ( BP3 , Fig . 57 ) could induce the degradation of HSP90 protein with a DC 50 of 0 . 99 µM and an IC 50 of 0 . 63 µM for cell proliferation inhibitory activity in MCF - 7 cells . When used as a single drug , degrader 202 ( BP3 ) could effectively inhibit the tumor proliferation in mice . IDO1 . Indoleamine 2 , 3 - dioxygenase 1 ( IDO1 ) is a heme enzyme that catalyzes the ﬁ rst and rate - limiting steps of the decomposi - tion of tryptophan into N - formyl - aminoylinosine . It acts on a variety of tryptophan substrates , including D - tryptophan , L - tryptophan , 5 - hydroxytryptophan , tryptophan , serotonin , and so on . 379 IDO1 plays a role in various pathophysiological processes , such as antibacterial , antitumor defense , neuropathology , immu - nomodulation , and antioxidant activity . 380 Recently , a large number of reports have con ﬁ rmed that IDO1 was overexpressed in a variety of cancers and plays an important role in cancer immune escape . Therefore , IDO1 has become one of the important targets in the ﬁ eld of tumor therapy . In fact , several highly effective and selective IDO1 inhibitors have entered the clinical development stage for the treatment of human cancer . 381 In 2020 , Xie group reported the application of PROTAC technology in the targeted degradation of IDO1 enzymes . They designed a series of targeted IDO1 degraders based on pomalidomide and IDO1 inhibitor Epacadostat , and evaluated their degradation activity and anti - proliferation in HeLa cells . 382 They found that the degrader 203 ( Fig . 58 ) had the best degradation activity of IDO1 , its DC 50 was 2 . 84 µM , D max was 93 % . And its antiproliferative activity on HeLa cells was 37 . 43 µM , which was signi ﬁ cantly better than the inhibitor Epacadostat . LXR - β . Liver X receptors ( LXRs ) are members of the orphan nuclear receptor transcription factor superfamily and ligand - dependent transcription factors , including two subtypes of LXR - α ( NR1H3 ) and LXR - β ( NR1H2 ) . 383 LXR - α is mainly expressed in the liver , spleen , kidney , lung , intestine , adipose tissue , and macro - phages , and LXR - β is widely and lowly expressed throughout the body . 384 When LXRs are activated by ligands or synthetic agonists , they can participate in the regulation of sugar , lipid , cholesterol metabolism , immune response , and in ﬂ ammation to regulate the transcription and expression of target genes . 385 Fig . 56 The representative PROTAC targeting CRABP Fig . 57 The representative PROTAC targeting HSP90 PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 38 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 In 2021 , Demizu group synthesized some LXR - β degraders based on the LXR - α / LXR - β agonist GW3965 and different E3 ligase ligands through different connection methods and then found that the VH032 - based degrader 204 ( GW3965 - PEG5 - VH032 , Fig . 59 ) had the best degradation activity of LXR - β , the obvious degradation of LXR - β could be observed when the drug concentration was 3 µM . 386 MIF . Macrophage migration inhibitory factor ( MIF ) is the ﬁ rst cytokine with the function of multiple in ﬂ ammatory mediators . It is also an important endocrine hormone . 387 As an in ﬂ ammatory chemokine , MIF plays a very important role in many diseases : metabolic diseases ( such as atherosclerosis ) , autoimmune dis - eases , cancers , infectious diseases ( such as sepsis ) and wound healing . 388 Therefore , MIF can be used as a biomarker and target of these diseases . In 2021 , Dekker group designed and synthesized a variety of degraders based on the MIF tautomerase inhibitors and pomali - domide . 389 Among them , the degrader 205 ( MD13 , Fig . 60 ) could induce the degradation of MIF with a DC 50 of 100 nM in A549 cells . It induced cell cycle arrest at the G2 / M phase and also inhibited ERK phosphorylation . PARP1 . The nuclear protein PARP1 has a well - established role in the signaling and repair of DNA , and is a validated therapeutic target for cancers and other human diseases . 390 Cancer cells bearing mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA 2 are exquisitely sensitive to PARP1 inhibitors , which is called synthetic lethality . To date , several small - molecule PARP1 inhibitors , such as Olaparib , Rucarparib , Niraparib , and Talazoparib , have been approved for the treatment of BRCA - mutation ovarian and breast cancers . 391 However , there are still challenges in terms of PARP1 inhibitors usage that limit their therapeutic utility , including the acquisition of drug resistance , the low proportion of BRCA1 or BRCA 2 mutations in cancer cells , and cytotoxicity caused by PARP1 trapping . 392 , 393 In 2019 , Yu group reported their works on the development of PARP1 degraders . 394 The degrader 206 ( iRucaparib - AP6 , Fig . 61 ) induced robust degradation of PARP1 at concentrations as low as 50 nM in primary rat neonatal cardiomyocytes . Knocking down the protein level of PARP1 , the degrader 206 ( iRucaparib - AP6 ) protected muscle cells and primary cardiomyocytes from DNA - damage - induced energy crisis and cell death . In summary , the degrader 206 ( iRucaparib - AP6 ) , by blocking both the catalytic and scaffolding functions of PARP1 without causing PARP1 trapping , provided an ideal approach for the treatment of cancers and other diseases caused by PARP1 hyperactivation . In 2020 , Shen group developed several PARP1 degraders based on the combination of PARP1 inhibitor Olaparib and lenalido - mide . 395 The representative degrader 207 ( Fig . 61 ) effectively induced the degradation of PARP1 at 10 µM in SW620 cells . At the same time , Chen group reported the design and synthesis of PARP1 degraders based on Olaparib and thalidomide / lenalido - mide . 396 The representative degrader 208 ( SK - 575 , Fig . 61 ) potently inhibited the growth of cancer cells bearing BRCA1 / 2 mutations , and induced potent and speci ﬁ c degradation of PARP1 in various human PARP1 - positive cancer cells with the D max more than 95 % . It was worth noting that the PK and PD data showed that a single dose of degrader 208 ( SK - 575 ) was fully exposed to plasma for more than 24 h and effectively induced PARP1 degradation in SW620 xenograft tumor tissues . Moreover , it exhibited durable tumor growth inhibition in mice when used as a single agent or in combination with cytotoxic agents . PARP14 . PARP14 is an interferon - stimulated gene that is over - expressed in a variety of tumors . By regulating IFN - γ and IL - 4 signals , affects the polarization of pro - tumor macrophages and inhibits the antitumor in ﬂ ammatory response . Catalytic inhibitors of PARP14 , such as RBM012042 , can reverse IL - 4 driven pro - tumor gene expression in macrophages . However , it is not clear what roles the non - enzymatic biomolecular recognition motifs play in PARP14 - driven immunology and in ﬂ ammation . However , the role of non - enzymatic functions of PARP14 in PARP14 - driven immunity and in ﬂ ammation is still unclear . 397 Kuntz group developed the ﬁ rst - in - class degrader 209 ( RBN012811 , Fig . 62 ) based on a PARP14 inhibitor RBN012042 . 398 The degrader 209 ( RBN012811 ) could selectively induce the degradation of endogenous PARP14 with DC 50 about Fig . 58 The representative PROTAC targeting IDO1 Fig . 59 The representative PROTAC targeting LXR - β Fig . 60 The representative PROTAC targeting MIF PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 39 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 5 nM in KYSE - 270 cells , and have no effect on the total protein levels of other PARP enzymes . It also could induce a dose - dependent reduction of IL - 10 levels in primary human macrophages . PD - L1 . Programmed death receptor ( PD - 1 ) , also known as CD279 , is an important immunosuppressive molecule . It regulates the immune system and promotes self - tolerance by downregulating the response of the immune system to human cells and by inhibiting the in ﬂ ammatory activity of T cells . 399 PD - L1 is a ligand of PD - 1 . The combination of PD - 1 and PD - L1 initiates the programmed death of T cells and enables tumor cells to obtain immune escape . PD - L1 is upregulated in a variety of tumor cells and it binds to PD - 1 on T cells , inhibits T - cell proliferation and activation , inactivates T cells , and ﬁ nally induces immune escape . 400 In 2020 , Chen group ﬁ rst reported a series of novel PD - L1 degraders . 401 Most of the compounds exhibited excellent inhibitory activities against PD - 1 / PD - L1 interaction , especially the degrader 210 ( P22 , Fig . 63 ) with an IC 50 value of 39 . 2 nM . The degrader 210 ( P22 ) could moderately induce the degradation of PD - L1 in a lysosome - dependent manner , which may contribute to its immune effects . In 2021 , Yang group reported another PD - L1 degrader 211 ( Fig . 63 ) based on BMS - 37 . 402 The degrader 211 could effectively induce the degradation of PD - L1 protein at micromolar in various malignant cells in a proteasome - dependent manner , such as MC - 38 , MCF - 7 , and Kasumi - 1 cells . Moreover , it could signi ﬁ cantly reduce PD - L1 protein levels of MC - 38 cancer cells in vivo , and achieve signi ﬁ cant tumor growth inhibition in the MC - 38 xenograft model . This approach showed that PROTAC could be used as a new alternative strategy for tumor immunotherapy . PLK1 . Polo - Like Kinase 1 ( PKL1 ) belongs to the polo - like kinase family , which is a type of serine / threonine kinase that is widely present in eukaryotic cells . The structure of PKL1 is highly conserved , with a kinase domain ( KD ) at the N - terminus and two conserved polo - box domains ( PBD ) at the C - terminus . 403 PBD is related to the subcellular localization and function of PKL1 . Normally , the PBD of PLK1 binds to the KD domain to inhibit the phosphorylation of T210 in the KD domain , thereby inhibiting its kinase activity . Once the PBD of PLK1 binds to its ligand , the PBD is immediately separated from the T loop of the kinase domain and PLK1 is activated . PLK1 kinase can interact with a variety of substrates through its kinase activity to regulate cell mitosis , cytokinesis , DNA - damage response , development , and other processes . 404 , 405 There is also a destruction box ( D box ) between the KD and PBD domains , which is closely related to the degradation of PLK1 . In 2020 , Lu group developed a dual degrader 118 ( HBL - 4 , Fig . 64 ) conjugated with the PLK1 inhibitor BI2536 and CRBN ligand through a PEG linker . 209 This was the ﬁ rst degrader for PLK1 . The degrader 118 ( HBL - 4 ) induced the ef ﬁ cient degradation of BRD4 and PLK1 in MV4 - 11 cells with a DC 50 of about 10 – 20 nM and 5 nM , respectively . Then they found the antiproliferative activity of the degrader 118 ( HBL - 4 ) ( IC 50 = 4 . 48 nM ) was better than BI2536 ( IC 50 = 88 . 5 nM ) in MV4 - 11 cells . At the same time , it induced dramatically improved ef ﬁ cacy in the MV4 - 11 tumor xenograft model compared with BI2536 . RAR . Retinoic acid receptors ( RAR ) belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily , including three subtypes of α , β , and γ . RAR - β is divided into β 1 , β 2 , β 3 , β 4 , and so on . RAR regulates the transcription of target genes by binding to their ligands , thereby exerting various biological effects . It plays an important role in mediating cell growth and apoptosis . 406 In 2011 , Hashimoto group developed an RAR degrader 212 ( Fig . 65 ) conjugated with the RAR inhibitor Ch55 and cIAP1 ligand BE04 through a PEG linker . 407 The degrader 212 could induce the degradation of RAR protein in HT1080 cells for the ﬁ rst time , while had no in ﬂ uence on the amount of CRABP - II . RHAU . Nucleic acids with a four - stranded helix structure are called G - quadruplexes , which are a class of nucleic acid secondary structures with important regulatory functions and are believed to play an important role in gene expression and telomere main - tenance . 408 G - quadruplex binding proteins play an important role in the regulation of life in which G - quadruplexes are involved . G - quadruplex - binding proteins include a variety of proteins , such as BRCA1 , PARP1 , RHAU , TRF2 , and so on . 409 RNA helicase associated with AU - rich element ( RHAU ) proteins has been identi ﬁ ed as a major source of quadruplex - resolving activity in cell lysates . 410 Phan group reported the novel degrader 199 ( G4 - PROTAC , Fig . 66 ) generated from a combination of G4 warhead and different E3 ligase ligands . 411 They found that a signi ﬁ cant downregulation of RHAU protein could be observed at 199 ( G4 - PROTAC ) concentra - tion of 1 nM , and its degradation activity increased along with increasing degrader concentration . At the same time , the degrader also had obvious “ hook effect ” . They also proved that the Fig . 61 The representative PROTACs targeting PARP1 Fig . 62 The representative PROTAC targeting PARP14 PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 40 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 degradation of RHAU protein could be rapidly induced after using the degrader for 6 h , and the degradation effect gradually increased with the prolongation of the incubation time . RIPK2 . Receptor serine / threonine kinases are single - pass trans - membrane protein receptors with serine / threonine protein kinase activity in the intracellular region . It mainly phosphorylates the serine or threonine in downstream signal proteins , transmits the extracellular signal into the cell , and then achieves a variety of biological functions by affecting gene transcription . Pattern recognition receptors NOD1 and NOD2 are located upstream of RIPK2 and regulate its activity . 412 The transcriptional activation of a variety of in ﬂ ammatory cytokine genes and a variety of immune diseases are related to the activation of this pathway . 413 In 2021 , Harling group developed a highly potent and selective RIPK2 degrader 214 ( Fig . 67 ) based on a novel IAP ligase ligand . 414 The degrader 214 successfully induced the ef ﬁ cient degradation of RIPK2 in the absence of cIAP1 autoubiquitination over a range of concentrations in human PBMCs . The DC 50 and D max were about 1 nM and 94 . 3 % , respectively . The antiproliferative activity of the degrader 214 ( IC 50 = 10 nM ) was better than other RIPK2 degraders . It exhibited low total systemic clearance in both rat and dog which afforded prolonged in vivo degradation of RIPK2 in vivo . In addition , it reduced endogenous RIPK2 in rats at low doses and extended PD that persists in the absence of detectable compound . SF3B1 . The spliceosome is a large protein - RNA complex that consists of ﬁ ve small nuclear RNAs ( snRNAs ) and a variety of associated proteins , such as splicing factor 3B ( SF3B ) . 415 SF3B subunit 1 ( SF3B1 ) is one of the fundamental components of the multiprotein complex SF3B and is involved in 30 splice site recognition at intron – exon junctions during RNA splicing . The SF3B1 gene is frequently mutated in tumors , such as myelodys - plastic syndrome ( 20 % ) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( 15 % ) . Because the functions of individual components of the spliceo - some are largely unknown , SF3B1 inhibitors ( such as pladienolide B , spliceostatin A , and herboxidiene ) are widely used to repress spliceosome - mediated alternative splicing and induce apoptosis in various tumor cells . 416 In 2021 , Cheng group reported the SF3B1 degrader 215 ( PROTAC - O4I2 , Fig . 68 ) by fusing thalidomide to O4I . 417 They found the degrader 215 ( PROTAC - O4I2 ) selectively induced the degradation of SF3B1 and induced cellular apoptosis in a CRBN - dependent manner . In a Drosophila intestinal tumor model , the degrader 215 ( PROTAC - O4I2 ) increased survival by interference with the maintenance and proliferation of stem cells . Thus , their results demonstrated that SF3B1 could be degraded by utilizing noninhibitory chemicals , which expanded the PROTAC target proteins . SLC . Among the membrane proteins that constitute about 27 % of all proteins in the human genome , the solute carrier ( SLC ) family is the second largest membrane protein family in humans , and consists of more than 400 types of proteins divided into 52 families . In recent years , phylogenetic analysis has shown that 15 SLC families can be divided into four phylogenetic clusters , namely α , β , γ , and δ . The sequence analysis has shown that 24 SLC families belong to three PFAM clans , MFS , APC , and CPA / AT . 418 SLCs are responsible for the absorption and transportation of several substances on cell membranes , including amino acids , nucleotides , sugars , inorganic ions , and drugs . Nearly 100 human SLCs that transport amino acids have been proposed , 60 % of them have been con ﬁ rmed to transport amino acids , and the rest are closely related to amino acid transporters known phylogen - etically . 419 In 2020 , Furga group developed a SLC degrader 216 ( d9A - 2 , Fig . 69 ) conjugated with a SLC9A1 inhibitor and pomalidomide with an optimized PEG linker . 420 The degrader 216 ( d9A - 2 ) was a ﬁ rst - class SLC PROTAC , which could induce the high - ef ﬁ ciency degradation of its homologous targeted SLC9A1 , as well as the degradation of other SLC9 members , such as the transporters SLC9A2 and SLC9A4 . The proliferation inhibitory activity of the degrader 216 ( d9A - 2 ) on KBM7 cells was consistent with the evidence of degradation in the cytotoxicity test . In addition , the degrader 216 ( d9A - 2 ) treatment resulted in a variety of cancer cell intracellular pH ( pHi ) restoration obstacles and toxicity . SMARCA2 / 4 . The ATP - dependent chromatin remodeling complex BAF / PBAF changes the position and composition of nucleosomes through slipping and elimination to achieve dynamic regulation of chromatin structure . About one - ﬁ fth of tumors occur are closely related to the complex somatic mutations . The studies have found that two ATPases in the complex SMARCA2 / 4 are potential cancer treatment targets . 421 SMARCA4 plays a tumor suppressor effect in solid tumors , but in AML it is necessary to maintain the oncogenic transcription program and drive proliferation . 422 It has been reported that the double allosteric inhibitor of SMARCA2 / 4 ATP enzyme activity effectively inhibited the proliferation of the SMARCA4 mutant xenograft model . 423 In 2019 , Ciulli group developed a series of SMARCA2 / 4 degraders conjugated with a bromodomain ligand and VHL ligand . 424 The degrader 217 ( Fig . 70 ) successfully induced the moderate ef ﬁ cient degradation of SMARCA2 / 4 in MV4 - 11 cells with the D max about 65 – 70 % . Guided by high - resolution ternary complex crystal structures of SMARCA2 BD - 217 - VCB , they also designed and developed the degrader 218 ( ACBI1 , Fig . 70 ) , a potent and cooperative degrader of SMARCA2 , SMARCA4 , and PBRM1 . The degrader 218 ( ACBI1 ) could effectively induce the degradation of SMARCA2 , SMARCA4 , and PBRM1 in MV4 - 11 cells Fig . 63 The representative PROTACs targeting PD - L1 Fig . 64 The representative PROTAC targeting PLK1 PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 41 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 with the DC 50 value of 6 , 11 , and 32 nM , respectively . In 2021 , Chinnaiyan group also linked the same bromodomain ligand with VHL and developed a degrader 219 ( AU - 15330 , Fig . 70 ) for SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 . 425 The degrader 219 ( AU - 15330 ) could induce the degradation of SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 in HEK293 and HeLa cells , but it also showed a certain degradation activity to PBRM1 . SRC - 1 . Steroid receptor coactivator ( SRC ) is a type of transcrip - tion coactivator , which usually contains three subtypes , namely SRC - 1 , SRC - 2 , and SRC - 3 . 426 SRC - 1 is the ﬁ rst identi ﬁ ed transcrip - tion coactivator that can promote the activity of various transcription factors ( TF ) , such as estrogen receptor α , progester - one receptor and so on . As a coactivator , SRC - 1 can not only promote the effect of transcription factor , but also promote the formation of protein complexes , so SRC - 1 plays an important role in the organism . 427 Studies have shown that the expression level of SRC - 1 is low in normal physiological body , and it is abnormally activated and highly expressed in tumor cells . Therefore , SRC - 1 is considered to be an oncogenic protein . Although corresponding inhibitors have been developed for SRC , most of them target SRC - 1 and SRC - 3 . The inhibitors are lack selectivity to SRC - 1 and are prone to cause side effects . 428 Therefore , using PROTAC technol - ogy to induce degradation of SRC - 1 protein has become a promising method . In 2020 , Lim group designed and synthesized the degrader 220 ( CL1 - LY2 , Fig . 71 ) that targeted SRC - 1 based on speci ﬁ c SRC - 1 ligand stapled peptide YL2 and pomalidomide . 429 Although the SRC - 1 binder was stapled peptide , it showed good binding af ﬁ nity to SRC - 1 . In MDA - MB - 231 cells , the degrader 220 ( CL1 - LY2 ) could induce degradation of SRC - 1 protein at 10 μ M , while it could not induce degradation of SRC - 1 protein in Colo205 cells with low CRBN expression . In addition , it did not induce degradation of SRC - 3 , indicating that it had good selectivity . Tyrosinase . Tyrosinase is the main rate - limiting enzyme of melanin synthesis , and it plays an important role in skin protection and pigmentation . So far , almost all tyrosinase inhibitors are based on cheap and easily available mushroom tyrosinase ( mTYR ) obtained through in vitro screening , such as hydroquinone , arbutin , L - ascorbic acid , ellagic acid , and tranexamic acid . 430 However , most tyrosinase inhibitors have certain side effects . For example , hydroquinone is toxic to human cells and can cause skin irritation and bone marrow toxicity , L - ascorbic acid is easily sensitive to heat , ellagic acid is insoluble and has poor bioavailability . 431 In addition , in order to produce an inhibitory effect , tyrosinase inhibitors need to constantly occupy the active site of the tyrosinase , but high doses can cause undesirable off - target effects and cause damage to the skin . 432 In 2021 , Tang group designed and synthesized a tyrosinase degrader based on L - Dopa and pomalidomide . 433 The degrader 221 ( TD9 , Fig . 72 ) had the best effect in inducing degradation of human tyrosinase , and it also showed obvious dose and time - dependent manner . It also proved that the degradation mechan - ism was achieved through the protein – ubiquitin system . In addition , they also used the low - toxicity degrader 221 ( TD9 ) on zebra ﬁ sh to reduce the synthesis of zebra ﬁ sh melanin , high - lighting the potential for the treatment of tyrosinase - related diseases .

He et al . 42 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 PROTACS TARGETING VIRUS - RELATED TARGETS Pan - coronavirus antiviral Indomethacin is a non - steroidal anti - in ﬂ ammatory drug ( NSAID ) with anti - in ﬂ ammatory , analgesic , and antipyretic properties . Its pharmacological effects are not fully understood . It is not only related to the activities of cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 , but also inhibit the biosynthesis of phospholipase A2 ( PLA - 2 ) and microsomal prostaglandin E synthase 2 ( mPGES - 2 ) . 434 Studies have shown that it had good activity against coronavirus infections , so it had great development potential in the ﬁ eld of anti - in ﬂ ammatory and antiviral . 435 In 2021 , Goracci group designed a series of PROTACs based on Indomethacin and VHL , 436 it was found that the degrader 222 ( Fig . 73 and 223 ( Fig . 73 ) had good inhibitory activities against a variety of coronaviruses through activity screening . Molecular simulations showed that PGES - 2 may be the potential target of INM - based antiviral PROTAC . SARS - CoV - 2 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) has infected more than 240 million individuals worldwide , and the death toll has exceeded 4 . 9 million and is still rising . Although some vaccines have been widely used to prevent COVID - 19 , due to the high mortality and the occurrence of mutations , the development of curable drugs has become more and more important . Although some drugs have entered the clinical trial stage , the therapeutic effect is still to be observed . So using new technologies to develop new treatments has become a strategy . Telaprevir - based PROTAC has been reported to be used for the degradation of HCV NS3 / 4A protease . The Mpro protein plays an important role in SARS - CoV - 2 , so PROTAC technology can be used to induce degradation of the Mpro protein so as to achieve the purpose of curing SARS - CoV - 2 . The applicability of PROTAC technology on SARS - CoV - 2 has been discussed recently by different groups . In order to apply PROTAC technology to the treatment of SARS - CoV - 2 , Sobhia group ﬁ rstly assessed the similarity of NS3 / 4A and Mpro residues . The sequence alignment results showed that Telaprevir could be used in the design of Mpro degraders . Subsequently , the degraders 224 – 226 ( Fig . 74 ) which were most likely to induce degradation of Mpro protein was generated by constructing a ternary complex model and simulating the protein – protein interaction . 437 PROTACS FOR TREATING IMMUNE DISORDERS HDAC3Histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) play important roles in in ﬂ ammatory diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . Currently , eighteen HDAC isoenzymes , which can be divided into four classes , have been discovered . Among them , class I HDACs , containing HDAC1 , 2 , 3 , and 8 , are well - known for their importance in cell motility , immunoregulation , and proliferation . 438 More and more studies have shown that HDAC3 is closely related to the occurrence and development of tumors . 439 However , because HDAC3 has a highly conserved catalytic domain , it is quite challenging to develop an isoenzyme - speci ﬁ c HDAC3 . In 2020 , Dekker group reported the development of a novel PROTAC targeting HDAC3 by tethering the CRBN ligand pomali - domide and o - aminoanilide - based class I HDAC inhibitors . 440 The degrader 227 ( HD - TAC7 , Fig . 75 ) induced the degradation of HDAC3 with a DC 50 value of 0 . 32 μ M in RAW 264 . 7 macrophages , whereas without in ﬂ uence on HDAC1 and 2 . In the same years , Liao group developed a novel VHL - based degrader 228 ( XZ9002 , Fig . 75 ) that could selectively and potently induce the degradation of HDAC3 in a dose and time - dependent manner . 441 Furthermore , Fig . 70 The representative PROTACs targeting SMARCA2 / 4 Fig . 71 The representative PROTAC targeting SRC - 1 Fig . 72 The representative PROTAC targeting tyrosinase PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 43 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 the degrader 228 ( XZ9002 ) had potent antiproliferative activity against cancer cells . H - PGDS Hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase ( HPGDS ) is an attractive target for the treatment of a variety of diseases , including allergic diseases and Duchenne muscular dystrophy . 442 To date , several types of H - PGDS inhibitors have been developed as therapies for allergic and in ﬂ ammatory responses . However , no HPGDS inhibitors have yet been approved into clinical studies . 443 There - fore , the development of novel agents having other modes of action to modulate the activity of H - PGDS is required . In 2021 , Demizu group reported the ﬁ rst H - PGDS degrader 229 ( PROTAC ( HPGDS ) - 1 , Fig . 76 ) by coupling the HPGDS inhibitor TCF - 007 with CRBN ligand pomalidomide . 444 The degrader 229 ( PROTAC ( HPGDS ) - 1 ) effectively induced the selective degrada - tion of H - PGDS protein and suppression of prostaglandin D2 ( PGD2 ) production . It was worth noting that the degrader 229 ( PROTAC ( HPGDS ) - 1 ) continued to inhibit the production of PGD2 after the removal of the drug , whereas the production of PGD2 was restored after the removal of TFC - 007 . In the same year , by using a docking simulation of the ternary complex of H - PGDS - PROTAC ( H - PGDS ) - 1 - cereblon , this group also successfully devel - oped the degrader 230 ( PROTAC ( H - PGDS ) - 7 , Fig . 76 ) without any linker . 445 The degrader 230 ( PROTAC ( H - PGDS ) - 7 ) exhibited potent and selective degradation of H - PGDS with DC 50 value of 17 . 3 pM after 6 h treatment , and potent suppression of prosta - glandin D2 production in KU812 cells . In addition , the degrader 230 ( PROTAC ( H - PGDS ) - 7 ) had better inhibition of in ﬂ ammatory cytokines than TFC - 007 in a Duchenne muscular dystrophy model using mdx mice with cardiac hypertrophy . Therefore , the degrader 230 ( PROTAC ( H - PGDS ) - 7 ) was expected to play a role in biological research and clinical treatment . IRAK1IRAK1 , a class of serine - threonine protein kinases associated with IL - 1R and TLR signaling , plays a key role in initiating the innate immune response against foreign pathogens . Upon activation , TLR or IL / 1Rs dimerizes and allows its intracellular structural domain to recruit the myeloid differentiation primary response 88 ( MyD88 ) adaptor protein . MyD88 molecules oligomerize through the N - terminal death domain ( DD ) and recruit IRAK containing the DD structural domain to form a macromolecular signaling complex called myddosome , which leads to the autophosphoryla - tion and activation of IRAK4 . Activated IRAK4 phosphorylates IRAK1 and / or IRAK2 , followed by the complementation of TNFR - associated factor 6 ( TRAF6 ) into the myddosome . Activated TRAF6 is then released into the cytoplasm , where it triggers activation of the I κ CB kinase ( IKK ) - nuclear factor - κ B ( NF - KB ) cascade and MAP kinase ( MAPK ) signaling pathways . 446 – 449 Despite some advances in the study of IRAK1 , IRAK1 remains a challenging target in the ﬁ eld of traditional small - molecule inhibitors , partly due to the lack of understanding of the structural domains primarily responsible for its scaffolding function . In 2021 , Dai group ﬁ rst reported a series of IRAK1 - targeting PROTAC based on IRAK1 inhibitor JH - I - 25 and VHL ligands . 450 The most potent degrader 231 ( JNJ - 1013 , Fig . 77 ) showed better kinase selectivity and potent IRAK1 degradation activity with DC 50 of 3 nM and D max of 96 % in HBL - 1 cells . In ABC DLBCL cells with the MyD88 L265P mutation , the degrader 231 ( JNJ - 1013 ) effectively blocked downstream signaling pathway of IRAK1 , induced apoptosis , and displayed stronger antiproliferative effects com - pared to IRAK1 inhibitors , indicating that the scaffold function of IRAK1 played a key role in ABC DLBCL cell survival . IRAK3IRAK3 ( interleukin - 1 receptor - associated kinase 3 , also known as IRAK - m ) is a class 1 pseudokinase member of the IRAK family ( along with IRAK1 , IRAK2 , and IRAK4 ) . 451 IRAK3 is believed to perform biological functions through a non - kinase - catalyzed scaffolding action . 452 The expression of IRAK3 is mainly restricted to leukocytes , and it has been reported to inhibit pro - in ﬂ ammatory signaling in innate leukocytes ( monocytes , macro - phages and neutrophils ) . 453 Knockdown of IRAK3 in mice leads to reprogram of myeloid cells toward immune activation and promotes proliferation of effector T cells , which in turn helps to overcome immune suppression and enhance the host response to checkpoint inhibition . 454 , 455 Since IRAK3 is a pseudokinase , it is unclear whether the molecule bound to IRAK3 has a functional role , and it is essential to employ some techniques to address this issue . In 2020 , Edmondsonet group ﬁ rst reported potent and selective IRAK3 degraders by conjugating a byproduct of IRAK4 inhibitors with CRBN and VHL ligands . 456 the degrader 232 ( Fig . 78 ) induced the degradation of IRAK3 with DC 50 of 2 nM and D max of 98 % in THP - 1 cells and primary macrophages . Although not yet fully optimized , the degrader 232 was an excellent tool to study the biology of IRAK3 degradation in vitro .

He et al . 44 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 IRAK4Playing a key role in both toll - like receptors ( TLRs ) and interleukin - 1 receptors ( 1L - 1R ) signaling pathways , IRAK4 has been identi ﬁ ed as a potential drug target involved in the innate immune process and has attracted widespread interest as a novel modality for the treatment of in ﬂ ammatory diseases and oncology . 457 Upon activation of TLRs or 1L - 1R receptors , MYD88 will be recruited to the TIR domain of the receptor , followed by the IRAK family to form a myddosome complex . IRAK4 bound to MYD88 will lead to phosphorylation of IRAK1 and IRAK2 in the complexed and subsequent activation of the IkB kinase ( IKK ) - nuclear factor - kB ( NF - kB ) and the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signaling pathways . Several reports have revealed an important role of IRAK4 in myddosome assembly in addition to its kinase catalytic function and its kinase backbone function , suggesting that overall inhibition or elimination of IRAK4 has a great potential to completely eliminate IL - 1R / TLR assembly or the resulting signaling . 458 Several investigators have begun to explore to use PROTACs to induce the degradation of IRAK4 . In 2019 , Anderson group reported a series of PROTACs by incorporating IRAK4 ligand PF - 06650833 to different E3 ligases . 459 The VHL - based degrader 233 ( Degrader - 3 , Fig . 79 ) induced the most potent degradation of IRAK4 with a DC 50 of 151 nM in PBMCs and 36 nM in dermal ﬁ broblast cells . However , the degrader 233 ( Degrader - 3 ) did not show additional potential bene ﬁ t upon TLR7 / 8 stimulation in PBMCs compared to PF - 06650833 . And the inhibition of IL - 6 and TNF - α was also not observed in IL - 1 β stimulated human dermal ﬁ broblasts . Never - theless , the possibility of targeting IRAK4 kinase allowed new therapeutic chances to treat autoimmune and oncological diseases . In 2020 , Dai group reported a series of potential PROTACs based on CRBN ligands and a highly selective IRAK4 inhibitor for the degradation of IRAK4 . 460 These PROTACs showed moderate af ﬁ nities to CRBN - DBB1 with binding af ﬁ nity values ranging from 490 to 1080 nM . Among all of the PROTACs , the degrader 234 ( Fig . 79 ) only induced the degradation of IRAK4 protein , displayed a remarkable selectivity of IRAK4 degradation in OCI - LY3 ABC DLBCL cells in a proteome - wide analysis . The degrader 234 induced the rapid degradation of IRAK4 with a DC 50 value of 405 nM in HEK293T cells after 24 h of treatment . The results showed that neither IRAK4 kinase inhibition nor degradation resulted in cell death or growth inhibition , suggesting that the role of IRAK4 in the survival of ABC DLBCL cells was redundant . IRAK4 PROTACs characterized in this study provided useful tools for understanding IRAK4 protein scaffolding function , which was previously unac - hievable through pharmacological perturbation . In 2021 , Duan group disclosed a set of PROTACs by conjugating an IRAK4 inhibitor to pomalidomide via ﬂ exible linkers , including hydrophilic polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) and hydrophobic all - carbon chains . 461 The most potent degrader 235 ( Fig . 79 ) induced the degradation of IRAK4 in OCI - LY10 and TMD8 cells in a dose and time - dependent manner . In addition , the degrader 235 ef ﬁ ciently blocked the IRAK4 - NF - κ B signaling pathway and displayed a substantial advantage in inhibiting the growth of cells expressing the MYD88 L265P mutation compared with the parent IRAK4 inhibitor .

He et al . 45 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 PROTACS FOR TREATING NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES GSK - 3 β Glycogen synthase kinase 3 ( GSK - 3 ) belongs to a multifunctional serine / threonine protein kinase under the phosphotransferase family . There are two isomers of mammalian GSK - 3 , namely GSK - 3 α and GSK - 3 β . 458 GSK - 3 β controls the synthesis of glycogen to regulate the metabolism of glycogen , and affects the permeability of mitochondria and the releases of cytochrome C to regulate apoptosis . GSK - 3 β also acts on activation of the transcription factors and functions in many biological processes including embryonic development , cell differentiation , and insulin response . 459 GSK - 3 β is abundant in brain and is associated with many neurodegenerative diseases and neurological disorders . Recently , GSK - 3 β has been described as a tumor suppressor due to its ability to phosphorylate the pro - oncogenic moleculars that affect the cell cycle and DNA repair . 460 The ﬁ rst GSK - 3 β degrader was reported by Sun group in 2021 . 461 The degrader 236 ( PG21 , Fig . 80 ) was a powerful GSK - 3 β degrader , it could effectively induce the degradation of GSK - 3 β in a dose - dependent manner , which could induce 44 . 2 % protein degradation at 2 . 8 μ M . Mechanistic investigation determined that the degrader 236 ( PG21 ) needed to rely on the intracellular UPS to induce GSK - 3 β degradation . In addition , it protected against glutamate - induced cell death in HT - 22 cells . LRRK2PARK8 is one of the genes associated with Parkinson ' s disease ( PD ) , which encodes leucine - rich repeat kinase 2 ( LRRK2 ) . 462 To date , a large number of disease - associated LRRK2 mutations have been identi ﬁ ed and ﬁ ve mutations ( R1441C , R1441G , Y1699C , G2019S , and I2020T ) are associated with PD pathogenesis . LRRK2 mutations , particularly the most common G2019S mutation , are observed in patients with autosomal dominant PD and apparently disseminated PD . Pathogenic mutations in the LRRK2 gene increase LRRK2 kinase activity , and LRRK2 kinase inhibitors are neuroprotective in preclinical models of Parkinson ' s disease . These ﬁ ndings make LRRK2 to be one of the important targets for the treatment of PD and targeting LRRK2 has become an effective treatment for PD . 463 In 2020 , Dömling group ﬁ rstly reported the PROTACs targeting LRRK2 degradation . 464 Series of potential LRRK2 PROTACs were constructed based on the LRRK2 inhibitors PF - 06447475 or GNE - 7915 and CRBN ligand pomalidomide . For example , the degrader 237 ( Fig . 80 ) was a representative degrader , although the PROTACs were effective in inhibiting kinase activity and performed good cell permeability , the western blotting did not show any signi ﬁ cant changes in LRRK2 protein level after the PROTACs treatment , which suggested that these PROTACs were unable to induce degradation of LRRK2 .

He et al . 46 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 α - Synuclein α - Synuclein is mainly expressed in human brain cells and central nervous system cells . It is a presynaptic 140 amino acid that has no secondary structure in many tissues . The misfolding and aggregation of these proteins is a pathological feature of Parkinson ' s disease ( PD ) and other neurodegenerative diseases . 465 In 2020 , Crew group published the patent on α - Synuclein degraders . 466 They designed and synthesized different degraders and tested their degradation activity in HEK293 TREX α - synuclein A53T cells . The experimental results showed that the degrader 238 ( Fig . 80 ) and 239 ( Fig . 80 ) induced degradation of α - Synuclein , and the degradation activity were 30 – 65 % at 1 µM , which proved neuronal diseases related to α - Synuclein accumula - tion and aggregation ( AD , PD , Dementia , etc . ) could be treated by targeted degradation of α - Synuclein . TauTau is a cytoskeletal protein that regulates the formation and stability of microtubules by binding to neuronal microtubules , and maintains the structure and function of cytoskeletal neurons . AD and other neurological diseases can occur when the tau protein is defective and cannot suf ﬁ ciently stabilize microtubules . 467 Hyper - phosphorylation and aggregation of tau protein destroy the microtubule structure , leading to neuro ﬁ brillary tangles in AD neurons . More and more evidence showed that the hyperpho - sphorylation of tau protein and the increase of p - tau protein aggregation are closely related to the occurrence and develop - ment of AD . 468 In 2021 , Wang group developed a novel tau protein degrader 240 ( C004019 , Fig . 80 ) by recruiting VHL E3 ligase . 469 It showed selective and potent tau protein degradation both in vitro cellular models ( HEK293 and SH - 5Y5Y ) and in vivo mice models ( hTau - transgenic and 3xTg - AD ) . Most importantly , both single and multiple doses ( once per 6 days for a total of ﬁ ve times ) of subcutaneous degrader 240 ( C004019 ) signi ﬁ cantly reduced tau levels in the brains of wild - type , hTau - transgenic , and 3xTg - AD mice with improved synaptic and cognitive function . Therefore , the degrader 240 ( C004019 ) could be considered as a promising drug candidate in related diseases . TRKATRKs are receptor tyrosine kinases encoded by the NTRK1 / 2 / 3 genes and contain mainly three members ( TRKA / B / C ) , which are associated with the development and function of neuronal tissues . 470 When the extracellular structural domains of TRKs bind to their corresponding ligands , they will induce dimeriza - tion and activation of the intracellular kinase domains of TRKs thereby providing signals to downstream PI3K / AKT , RAF / MEK / ERK , and phospholipase C gamma ( PLC γ ) . 471 This ultimately leads to constitutive activation of the TRK pathway and promotes cell proliferation , survival , and malignant transformation . In 2020 , Chen group reported a series of selective and potent TRKA degraders by conjugating a pan - TRK inhibitor GNF - 8625 to CRBN ligand thalidomide . 472 The degrader 241 ( CG416 , Fig . 80 ) and 242 ( CG428 , Fig . 80 ) were the most promising degraders , whose DC 50 were 0 . 48 nM and 0 . 36 nM in KM12 cells . The degrader 241 ( CG416 ) and 242 ( CG428 ) also induced degrada - tion of wild - type TRKA with DC 50 values of 1 . 26 nM and 2 . 23 nM in HEL cells . These two degraders exhibited more potent inhibition of cell growth than the TRK inhibitor GNF - 8625 . Further , they also exhibited good plasma exposure in mice . These results suggested that they were valuable chemical tools for investigating TRKA function . TRKCTRKC , a member of the TRK family , is closely related to the development and function of neuronal tissues . The decrease in TRKC has been found in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases including AD , PD , and HD . 473 In addition , overexpression and aberrant activation of TRKC has been observed in a variety of human tumors . Aberrant activation of TRKC and TRKC fusion proteins signi ﬁ cantly induces growth rate , epithelial – mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , and oncogenic capacity through constitutive activation of the PI3K - AKT , RAS - MAP kinase ( MAPK ) , and JAK2 - STAT3 pathways . 474 In 2019 , Zhao group reported the ﬁ rst TRKC PROTACs based on the TRKC binder IY - IY ( K d = 112 nM ) and different E3 ligase ligands . 475 pomalidomide - based degrader 243 ( Fig . 80 ) showed better degradation activity of TRKC with an estimated DC 50 of 0 . 1 – 1 . 0 μ M . TRKC degraders may provide opportunities for alternative treatment strategies for TRKC - related diseases . OTHER PROTACS Engineered Cas protein Cas protein ( CRISPR - associated protein ) is a type of nuclease in the CRISPR ( Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic Fig . 81 The representative PROTACs targeting Cas protein , HMGCR and VEGFR2 PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 47 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 repeats ) system , which plays an important role in the adaptive immune function of CRISPR system . 476 , 477 It assists CRISPR - Cas systems in targeting and ultimately degrading foreign nucleic acids under the guidance of CRISPR RNA ( crRNA ) . 478 , 479 Cas protein can be divided into two classes ( Classes 1 and 2 ) and six types ( types I – VI ) based on their speci ﬁ c mechanisms of guiding RNA biogenesis and targeting interference . 480 , 481 There are several most widely used examples such as Cas9 ( type II ) , Cas12 ( type V ) , and Cas13 ( type VI ) . 482 – 484 Although CRISPR - Cas system has become a powerful tool to manipulate the human genome for gene therapy , it may still cause some side effects owing to off - target edits . 485 In 2021 , Cheng group developed engineered Cas FCPF proteins ( Cas9 , dCas9 , Cas12 , and Cas13 ) by inserting a Phe - Cys - Pro - Phe ( FCPF ) amino acid sequence ( known as the π - clamp system ) into Cas proteins , which could be labeled by per ﬂ uoroaromatics carrying the ﬂ uorescein . Then they designed a per ﬂ uoroaromatics - based degrader 244 ( PROTAC - FCPF , Fig . 81 ) by using lenalidomide as E3 ligases ligand . The degrader 247 ( PROTAC - FCPF ) could induce the degradation of Cas9 FCPF with IC 50 of 167 . 2 nM in HEK293T cells and 143 . 4 nM in HeLa cells . 486 HMGCRHMG - CoA reductase ( HMGCR ) is an eight - channel transmembrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) . It is the rate - limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway and a classical drug target of statins which can lower the cholesterol and preventing cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . 487 , 488 Statins competi - tively bind to the active site of the enzyme through its HMG - like part to prevent the production of mevalonate and downstream derivatives including cholesterol . However , statins may cause a compensatory increase in protein expression 489 which limits the maximal effectiveness of the drug and provoking some side effects including skeletal muscle damage . 490 , 491 With the devel - opment of PROTACs , a promising therapeutic approach to induce degradation of proteins of interests , it might be able to solve this problem by chemical knockdown instead of small - molecule inhibition . 492 The ﬁ rst degrader of HMGCR was reported by Rao group in 2020 . 493 They synthesized a class of PROTACs by linking Atorvastatin with CRBN ligands . The most potent and selective degrader 245 ( P22A , Fig . 81 ) induced the degradation of HMGCR with DC 50 of 0 . 1 μ M . HMGCR was the ﬁ rst ER - localized and polytopic transmembrane protein successfully degraded by PROTAC . It highlighted the potential application of PROTAC technique in treating hypercholesterolemia and CVD . In 2021 , Xiang group developed the VHL - based PROTAC targeting HMGCR . 494 By combining VHL with Lovastatin they demonstrated the most potent degrader 246 ( Fig . 81 ) with IC 50 of 0 . 25 µM . Furthermore , they conducted experiments to evaluate the HMGCR degradation potency in vivo and con ﬁ rmed that the degrader 246 could be the active ingredient to lower cholesterol in vivo . The VHL - based degrader 246 was the ﬁ rst PROTAC targeting HMGCR with oral activity . VEGFR2Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2 ( VEGFR2 , pre - viously known as KDR or Flk - 1 ) is a member of VEGFR family of receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTK ) 495 , 496 and plays an important role in angiogenesis . It is a highly active kinase and can stimulate many signaling pathways and varieties of biological responses . VEGFR2 is the key receptor that mediate the major growth and permeability actions of VEGF . Mice lacking VEGFR2 are unable to develop a vasculature and have rare endothelial cells . 497 , 498 As a member of RTKs , the basic activation principles of VEGFR2 can be separated into three parts . The ﬁ rst procedure is dimerization of receptor monomers mediated by ligand , followed by the transphosphorylation with dimerized receptors and docking of signaling proteins to receptor phosphotyrosines . 499 , 500 Occupancy - based RTK inhibitors are the traditional methods to intervene the pathological angiogenesis . However , owing to the high concentration and potential off - target side effects , it is necessary to develop PROTACs to treat angiogenesis . In 2020 , Zhang group designed several PROTACs based on the previously developed anti - angiogenesis agents . 501 They combined their novel potent angiogenesis inhibitors S7 ( biphenyl - aryl ureas incorporated with salicyladoxime ) and E3 ubiquitin ligases ligand ( VH032 ) with different lengths of dicarboxylic acid . The most potent degrader targeting VEGFR2 were degrader 247 ( PROTAC - 2 , Fig . 81 ) and 248 ( PROTAC - 5 , Fig . 81 ) with IC 50 of 32 . 8 μ M and 38 . 7 μ M . The degrader 247 ( PROTAC - 2 ) could speci ﬁ cally reduce the protein levels of VEGFR2 and normalize the abnormal vessels without signi ﬁ cant cytotoxicity . NEW TECHNOLOGIES BASED ON PROTACS In the above space , we summarize the main progress in the PROTAC ﬁ eld in the past 2 years . Compared with traditional small - molecule inhibitors , although PROTACs have shown obvious advantages , they also have similar disadvantages as small - molecule inhibitors . First , because PROTAC is developed based on POI inhibitors , it still has a certain degree of off - target effect . Secondly , due to the large molecular weight of PROTAC , it has poor cell - membrane permeability and poor pharmacokinetic ( PK ) properties , which greatly reduces its biological and therapeutic effects . In addition , although some PROTACs can ef ﬁ ciently induce the degradation of target proteins , their biological effects are so weak that they do not have an effective effect on the disease . Finally , most proteins do not have corresponding small - molecule binders for designing PROTACs , such as most transcription factors , which play an important role in the occurrence and development of diseases . The inhibitors of transcription factors are few , resulting in there is no binder available when designing PROTACs targeting transcription factors . This greatly limits the application of PROTAC technology . Therefore , it is of great signi ﬁ cance to integrate other drug design strategies into PROTAC technology to solve the above shortcomings . In order to solve the problems mentioned above , different types of PROTAC technologies have emerged in recent years , such as Antibody - PROTAC , Aptamer - PROTAC , Dual - target PROTAC , Folate - caged PROTAC , and Transcription factor - PROTACs , etc . Although these technologies are based on PROTACs , they all have advantages that are different from traditional PROTAC technolo - gies . For example , Antibody - PROTAC can overcome the short - comings of PROTACs off - target effect and weak tissue speci ﬁ city , Aptamer - PROTAC can improve the cell - membrane permeability and pharmacokinetic ( PK ) properties of PROTACs . Although these new PROTAC - based technologies achieved degradation on very few proteins , they undoubtedly injected vitality into the develop - ment of PROTACs . So we will brie ﬂ y introduce these new technologies . Antibody - PROTAC Antibody - PROTAC is a new strategy to explore the combination of PROTAC and antibodies to assemble new Antibody - PROTAC conjugates . This technology can achieve the speci ﬁ c degradation of proteins in different cells and tissues , thereby optimizing the therapeutic window and maximizing the treatment window , reducing the side effects of broad - spectrum PROTAC and increasing its potential as a drug or chemical tool . What ’ s more , although examples of intravenous ( IV ) and oral ( PO ) administra - tion have been reported , most of the currently reported PROTACs are usually delivered to animals by subcutaneous ( SC ) or intraperitoneal ( IP ) administration routes , 502 – 505 which result in their low bioavailability . Contrastly , the antibody - PROTAC PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 48 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 conjugate technology can be used to overcome the potential delivery dif ﬁ culties of PROTACs . In 2020 , Tate group reported a trastuzumab - PROTAC con - jugate 249 ( Ab - PROTAC 3 , Fig . 82 ) based on trastuzumab and BRD4 degrader . 506 Its antibody connection position is at the end of E3 ligase , and the antibody linker can be hydrolyzed in the cell and then releases active PROTAC and induces the degradation of BRD4 protein . They found that the conjugate 249 ( Ab - PROTAC 3 ) only induced the degradation of BRD4 protein in HER2 - positive breast cancer cell lines ( SK - BR - 3 and BT474 ) , but not in HER2 - negative cells ( MCF - 7 and MDA - MB 231 ) . Signi ﬁ cant degradation of BRD4 protein was observed in HER2 + cells incubated with 50 nM and 100 nM conjugate 249 ( Ab - PROTAC 3 ) for 4 hours , but not detected at any concentration in the HER2 − cell lines . This study veri ﬁ ed the concept of tissue - speci ﬁ c Ab - PROTAC inducing BRD4 protein degradation , overcoming the limitations and selectivity of PROTACs , and laying the foundation for the development of new type PROTAC . Researchers from Genentech have also developed a series of Ab - PROTAC conjugates based on different antibodies and BRD4 degraders . In 2020 , they reported an antibody - PROTAC conjugate 250 ( CLL1 - 5 , Fig . 82 ) based on CLL1 ( C - type lectin - like molecule - 1 , 507 also known as C - type lectin domain family 12 member A ( CLEC12A ) and the BRD4 degrader developed by themselves . To avoid the aggregation problem caused by high lipophilicity of linker , they linked six BRD4 degraders to CLL1 . After antibody - mediated delivery , the higher drug loading of these conjugates could increase the intracellular drug concentration . Afterward , the conjugate 250 ( CLL1 - 5 ) showed signi ﬁ cant antitumor activity in the HL - 60 AML xenograft model . All of these results proved that the mechanism of the conjugate 250 ( CLL1 - 5 ) was the degrada - tion of BRD4 protein induced by PROTAC after antibody - mediated delivery . At the same time , they also reported another antibody - PROTAC conjugate 251 ( HER2 - 14 , Fig . 82 ) based on HER2 and ERa degrader . 508 It was subsequently proved that the antibody - PROTAC conjugates could be delivered dependently to MCF - 7 - neo / HER2 cells , and the conjugate 251 ( HER2 - 14 ) had the best Fig . 82 The representative PROTACs of antibody - PROTAC PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 49 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 effect on ER α degradation , with a DC 50 of 0 . 03 µg / mL and a D max of 94 % . By synthesizing different antibody - PROTAC conjugates and testing their degradation activities , they proved that the linker between the antibody and PROTAC could adjust the stability of the conjugate and regulate the ef ﬁ ciency of releasing the degrader in the cell . In 2021 , they successively reported two types of antibody - PROTAC conjugates based on different BRD4 degraders and antibodies . First , they designed a series of BRD4 protein degraders based on JQ1 . On this basis , they used different linkers to connect the degraders to the antibodies to synthesize antibody - PROTAC conjugates . The antibodies they used included STEAP1 ( an antibody that recognizes the six transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 1 ) , CLL1 , and HER2 . 509 It was found that in the PC - 3 - S1 cell line , the conjugate 252 ( STEAP1 - 5a , Fig . 82 ) showed the best BRD4 degradation activity with a DC 50 of 0 . 67 nM , but its antiproliferative activity was poor , with an IC 50 value more than 790 nM . The possible reason may be the poor cell - membrane - permeability properties . Subsequently , on the basis of previous researches , by replacing the structure of the BRD4 degrader and synthesizing a series of antibody - PROTAC conjugates again they found the conjugate 253 ( STEAP1 - 13a , Fig . 82 ) had good BRD4 protein - degradation activity , 510 and its DC 50 was 1 . 4 nM . At the same time , it showed good antiproliferative activity against PC - 3 - S1 cell line with IC 50 of 29 nM . In addition , they also evaluated antiproliferative activity of the conjugate 253 ( STEAP1 - 13a ) in PC - 3 - S1 and HL - 60 xenograft models and found that it achieved antigen - dependent antitumor activity in both prostate cancer and AML xenograft models . Aptamer - PROTAC conjugates In addition to antibody - PROTAC , Aptamer - PROTAC is also a new PROTAC technology that can improve water solubility , membrane permeability , and tumor targeting , which are typical disadvan - tages of traditional PROTACs . 511 Aptamer is single - stranded nucleic acid with complex three - dimensional structures , which mainly include stems , loops , hairpins , and G4 polymers . 512 They bind to target proteins with high speci ﬁ city and af ﬁ nity through special effects , including hydrogen bonding , van der Waals force , base stacking force and electrostatic effect . 513 Due to special properties , aptamers are also called chemical antibodies by researchers . Compared with other targeting carriers , aptamers have the following advantages : ( 1 ) good tissue permeability , ( 2 ) good in vivo safety , ( 3 ) no obvious immunogenicity . They have been widely used in targeted therapy for human tumors . 514 , 515 Inspired by the application of aptamers in targeted tumor therapy , in 2021 Sheng group designed and synthesized the ﬁ rst Aptamer - PROTAC conjugate ( APC ) by combining the aptamer with the BET protein degrader . 516 They used a disul ﬁ de bond to connect the effective BET ( BRD4 ) degrader and the nucleoside - dependent aptamer AS to synthesize the APC 254 ( APR - Cy3 , Fig . 83 ) . The conjugate APC had a good effect on the BET degradation in MCF - 7 breast cancer cells . It is the ﬁ rst time this study has proved that aptamer binding could help improve degrader targeting speci ﬁ city , reduce toxicity , and enhance in vivo antitumor activity and protein - degradation activity . Therefore , the innovative APC technology established in this work may improve the drug similarity of traditional PROTACs and provide a new method for obtaining degraders which have better tumor tissue speci ﬁ city and clinical ef ﬁ cacy . Dual - target PROTACS In addition to using antibody - PROTAC and Aptamer - PROTAC to solve the targeting speci ﬁ city and membrane permeability problems of PROTAC , how to improve the antitumor activity of PROTAC is also an urgent problem to be solved . But during the occurrence and development of cancer , there are usually many factors working together , including different kinds of kinases and growth factors , which can act independently or interfere with each other through signal networks . 517 In the process of cancer treatment , tumor cells can easily obtain drug resistance by compensatory action or other signal pathways activation . 518 Therefore , there are obvious limitations in drug treatment for a single target . In order to overcome the shortcomings , drug development for two or more targets has received more and more attention . Although “ cocktail therapy ” has achieved good clinical effects , long - term large doses and multiple use of different types of drugs have greatly reduced the compliance and quality of life of patients . Therefore , the development of single - drug - based dual - target drugs has become one of the strategies . The method is mainly to design a single molecule that combined two or more pharmacophores to target two or more antitumor targets at the same time . In the previous studies , there have been a large number of reports showing that the dual inhibitors based on this strategy can achieve good antitumor effects , 519 – 521 and it has gradually become an alternative to combination therapy . The currently reported PROTACs are basically degraders designed based on only one protein . Although the one degrader can induce the degradation of different proteins , 294 , 522 – 525 it is mostly caused by off - target effects of the protein ligands more than the rational design of multi - target degradation . Therefore , for two abnormal proteins in the same disease , it has become a way to treat the disease with a powerful degrader that is rationally designed based on two different ligands . In 2021 , Li group used the E3 ligase ligand and the EGFR inhibitor Ge ﬁ tinib and the PARP inhibitor Olaparib to form star - shaped dual - target degraders , 526 and then evaluated their degradation activities of the two proteins in H1299 cells . They found that the compound 255 ( DP - V - 4 , Fig . 84 ) showed the best dual - target degradation activity . Its degradation activity of PARP was slightly better than that of EGFR , and the DC 50 of PARP was 0 . 47 µM . As the concentration increased , its degradation activity gradually increased . Meanwhile , its degradation activity of EGFR was weak and a higher concentration was required to achieve effective degradation . Subsequently , they tested the antiprolifera - tive activity of the compound 255 ( DP - V - 4 ) in H1299 cells . Its IC 50 was 19 . 92 µM , which was between EGFR inhibitor Ge ﬁ tinib ( IC 50 = 6 . 56 µM ) and PARP inhibitor Olaparib ( IC 50 = 35 . 93 µM ) . The weaker antiproliferative activity of the compound 255 ( DP - V - 4 ) may be due to the larger molecular weight of the degrader , which leads to poor solubility and cell permeability . Folate - caged PROTACs Folate - caged PROTACs is another technology that can improve the targeting speci ﬁ city of PROTACs . Its basic principle is similar to Antibody - PROTAC , which introduces folate groups into PROTAC molecules to achieve release in targeted cells and tissues . Since folate receptor α ( FOLR1 ) is low in normal tissues but is highly expressed in many human cancers , including Fig . 83 The representative PROTACs of aptamer - PROTAC conjugates PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 50 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 multiple myelom ( MM ) , lymphoma , and non - small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , folate - conjugating strategy is one of the commonly used drug delivery methods . This strategy has been widely and maturely used in tumor imaging and cancer - targeted drug delivery . At the same time , several FOLR1 targeted drugs have good antitumor effects and are currently in phase II / III clinical trials . 527 – 534 Therefore , the use of folate - conjugating strategy in PROTACs technology ( folate - caged PROTACs ) to achieve the speci ﬁ c delivery of degraders to cancer cells has become a practical method . In this technology , folate releases active PROTAC by the action of cell endogenous hydrolase , and then the degrader induces the degradation of the target protein Fig . 84 The representative PROTAC of dual - target PROTACs Fig . 85 The representative PROTACs of Folate - Caged PROTACs PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 51 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 ( POI ) . This strategy can eliminate the potential toxicity of degraders in normal tissues . In 2021 , Wei and Jin group reported the ﬁ rst folate - caged PROTAC . To ensure that the design of folate - caged PROTAC was universally applicable , they introduced a folate group on the E3 ubiquitin ligase ligand . 535 Based on the reported BRD protein degrader ARV - 771 , they combined folate to the hydroxyl group of VHL via an ester bond to obtain folate - caged PROTAC 256 ( Folate - ARV - 771 , Fig . 85 ) . Subsequently , they tested the degrada - tion activity of the folate - caged PROTAC 256 ( Folate - ARV - 771 ) on BRD4 protein in different cell lines and found that it could introduce the degradation of BRD4 protein effectively , which was equivalent to the degrader ARV - 771 in cells that highly express folate , when it also has shown similar antiproliferative activity as ARV - 771 . Meanwhile , as the expression of folate was less in normal cells , the degradation activity of BRD4 protein and antiproliferative activity were weaker than that of degrader ARV - 771 . Those experiments have proved that folate - caged PROTAC could exert high - ef ﬁ ciency degradation activity and anti - proliferation activity in tumor cells with high folate expression while its activity was weak in normal cells , which has achieved the purpose of targeting speci ﬁ c cells to generate degradation activity . In addition , they also designed other folate - caged PROTAs that target other proteins in order to verify the versatility of the method . They designed folate - caged PROTAC 257 ( Folate - MS432 , Fig . 85 ) which was based on the MEK protein degrader MS432 , 258 ( Folate - MS99 , Fig . 85 ) , and 259 ( FA - S2 - MS4048 , Fig . 85 ) Fig . 86 The representative PROTACs of TF - PROTACS PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 52 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 which were based on the ALK protein degrader MS99 and MS4048 . 536 And then it was also found that the folate - caged PROTACs have similar properties to that of Folate - ARV - 771 . They could ef ﬁ ciently introduce the degradation of the target proteins and have strong antiproliferative activity in high - expression - folate cell lines whereas having little effect on the target protein in normal cells . Subsequently , they reported the ﬁ rst case of folate - caged molecular glue 260 ( FA - S2 - POMA , Fig . 85 ) that was designed and synthesized based on pomalidomide . They found that in cell lines that highly express folate , the molecular glue 260 ( FA - S2 - POMA ) could ef ﬁ ciently induce the degradation of IKZF3 , but its antiproliferative activity ( IC 50 = 1 . 0 µM ) on MM . 1S cells was weaker than that of pomalidomide ( IC 50 = 58 nM ) , which may be caused by the incomplete release of the molecular glue caged by folate in the cells . In summary , they designed a universal folate - caged PROTAC design platform , through which they proved that the strategy could be applied to the protection and targeted delivery of PROTACs and molecular glues . This strategy could realize the selection of degraders for cancer cells and the safety for normal cells , and provide a reference method for avoiding the potential toxicity of protein degraders . TF - PROTACs Transcription factors ( TFs ) are a class of proteins that are related to gene expression and regulation . 537 In addition to normal regulatory functions , the cancer dependency map project ( DepMap ) also ﬁ nds that TFs are also a class of essential proteins that maintain cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis , thus indicating that TFs are potential targets for tumor therapy . 538 There are about 1600 TFs discovered and they can be divided into more than a dozen families according to their functions and structures . These TFs are different from traditional kinases as they do not have active pockets or allosteric regulatory site commonly found in kinases or other enzymes , so they are dif ﬁ cult to be targeted by small - molecule inhibitors . 539 Among the reported TFs , only a few have small - molecule inhibitors , including NF - κ B , 540 , 541 STAT3 / 5 , 542 – 544 MYC , 545 , 546 , and nuclear receptors AR 547 , 548 and ER . 549 Most other TFs cannot be effectively targeted by small - Table 7 .

He et al . 53 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 molecule inhibitors , so the development of TFs small - molecule inhibitors is extremely dif ﬁ cult . Since TFs can bind to speci ﬁ c DNA sequences and regulate the transcription process , different DNA sequences can be used instead of small - molecule inhibitors to target TFs and regulate their biological functions in theory . At present , researchers have experimentally determined more than 600 DNA sequences that can speci ﬁ cally bind to human TFs , which provides great possibilities for the targeted regulation of TFs . Inspired by the PROTAC technology , researchers are thinking about whether the small - molecule ligands that target the protein in the PROTAC can be replaced with the corresponding DNA sequence , so that it can form a TF - PROTAC to target speci ﬁ c TFs and induce their degradation to regulate the level of speci ﬁ c TFs and biological functions . In 2021 , Wei group reported a platform named TF - PROTAC , 550 which linked DNA sequences to E3 ligase ligands via a copper - free strain - promoted azide - alkyne cycloaddition ( SPAAC ) reaction to selectively induce the degradation of the interested TFs ( Fig . 86 ) . They used NF - KB as the ﬁ rst TF to be degraded and designed a series of BCN - modi ﬁ ed VHL ligands . At the same time , they generated a single strand DNA oligonucleotide , 5 ′ - TGGGGACTTTC - CAGTTTCTGGAAAGTCCCCA - 3 ′ ( hereafter termed as NF - κ B - ODN ) 551 that speci ﬁ cally bind to NF - KB , then modi ﬁ ed it by azide and obtained N 3 - NF - κ B - ODN . Afterward , they tested the binding of BCN - modi ﬁ ed VHL ligands to the modi ﬁ ed N 3 - NF - κ B - ODN in cells and found that most VHL ligands could interact well with N 3 - NF - κ B - ODN . By having tested the degradation activity of different VHL ligands to p65 ( a subunit of NF - KB ) in HeLa cells , they found that dNF - κ B # 15 and dNF - κ B # 16 showed the best activity to induce the degradation of p65 and had good antiproliferative activity in tumor cells . Moreover , they used this technology to design a TF - PROTAC that induced the degradation of E2F . Similar to the above method , they selected a double - strand DNA , in which the sense chain was 5 ′ - CTAGATTTCCCGCG - 3 ′ and the antisense chain was 5 ′ - CTAGCGCGGAAAT - 3 ′ ( hereafter named as E2F - ODN ) 552 that targeted E2F and modi ﬁ ed it by azide to obtain N 3 - E2F - ODN . Then , the degradation activities of different VHL ligands to E2F were tested in HeLa cells , and it was found that dE2F # 16 and dE2F # 17 showed the best E2F degradation activity and also had good antiproliferative activity in tumor cells . This was the ﬁ rst report of the technology for targeted degradation of TFs . The experimental results have shown this platform is a universal technology for inducing the degradation of TFs and that it has overcome the shortcomings of traditional small - molecule inhibi - tors and thus provided a possible solution to target the undruggable TFs . In 2021 , Crews group developed a novel targeted TFs degradation technology “ oligoTRAFTACs ” 553 ( Fig . 86 ) , which is based on the binding of oligonucleotide sequences to TFs , the binding of E3 ligase ligands to E3 ligase , and the ubiquitination degradation system in vivo . This technology requires the generation of a chimeric oligoTRAFTAC via a copper - catalyzed alkyne - azide cycloaddition ( CuAAC ) click reaction between an alkyne - oligonucleotide and an azide - containing VHL ligand , which then acts on the target TFs , resulting in the degradation of a transcription factor of interest . In this study , they successfully induced the degradation of c - Myc and brachyury using two different oligoTRAFTACs , and also demonstrated the feasibility of applying oligoTRAFTACs to degrade brachyury in vivo in zebra ﬁ sh . Apart from the new technologies based on PROTAC described above , researchers have also developed a series of other new technologies , such as BioPROTACs , 554 Covalent PROTACs , 555 Photocaged PROTACs , 556 Pre - fused PROTACs , 557 RNA - PROTAC , 558 – 560 Semiconducting polymer nano - PROTACs , 561 Triva - lent PROTACs 212 , 562 , and so on . These innovations can not only induce the degradation of target proteins but also induce the degradation of RNA , make up for the related shortcomings of traditional PROTAC and achieve the control of PROTAC on space and time scales . They have been well applied in a variety of cells , and laid the foundation for the development and maturity of PROTAC technology . Since having been reviewed in literatures , these technologies are only brie ﬂ y discussed in this article . PROTACS IN CLINICAL TRIALS In addition to research tools , PROTACs also have great potential applications in disease treatment . It has become a new mode of drug discovery , which has the potential to change traditional drug discovery and may become a new blockbuster therapy . Update to March 2022 , about a dozen PROTACs around the world have entered the clinical development stage ( Table 7 ) . Among them , Arvinas ’ ARV - 110 and ARV - 471 have entered clinical phase II stage , which are the fastest clinical progress in PROTAC drugs . Some R & D start - ups have gained the attention of large global pharmaceutical companies such as Roche , Sano ﬁ , Merck , P ﬁ zer , Gilead , etc . In addition , Chinese companies have also actively participated in the development , including BeiGene , Kintor , Haisco , Nuocheng Jianhua , Ascentage , Hengrui , etc . Based on the application time of clinical trials , there are two applications in 2019 , one in 2020 , nine in 2021 , and eight in 2022 . It can be seen that clinical applications are currently in an explosive growth mode . In the future , more and more companies will participate in clinical trials of PROTAC - related drugs . Based on the targets in clinical trials , AR has the most examples by six , BTK is followed by four , ER and BRD9 are two , respectively , and all the other remaining targets are one . It can be seen that currently pharmaceutical companies are more inclined to targets with relatively high maturity . Today , PROTAC technology has become a new strategy for new drug research and development , providing new methods for the treatment of diseases . The next few years will be a critical period for the development of PROTACs . More and more PROTACs will enter preclinical and clinical research to further test the therapeutic effect of PROTACs . It is expected that PROTAC technology will provide bene ﬁ ts for human disease treatment and life health in the future . CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES Since the ﬁ rst case of PROTAC was reported in 2001 , PROTAC technology has entered the stage of practical application from concept . Although the ﬁ eld of PROTAC has been rapidly developed in the past 20 years , there are still many challenges to be solved . These challenges mainly come from two aspects , namely PROTAC molecular design and optimization of drugg - ability , and comprehensive evaluation of biological activity . The ﬁ rst is about the molecular design and druggability of PROTAC , involving target protein ligands , new E3 ligase ligands , and new linking chains . 1 . Design of target protein ligand . Most of the PROTAC molecules that have been reported are kinase degraders , and there are few examples of targeting undruggable targets . PROTAC molecules that target kinases are usually obtained by using existing small - molecule inhibitors as target protein ligands for modi ﬁ cation . These inhibitors are designed for target kinase binding pockets . For undruggable targets , including transcrip - tion factors , phosphatases , protein – protein interactions , etc . , the overall progress is slow due to the lack of effective small - PROTACs : great opportunities for academia and industry ( an update from . . . He et al . 54 Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy ( 2022 ) 7 : 181 molecule ligands . 2 . New E3 ligase ligand . There are still few E3 ligases that can be used in PROTAC design . How to expand the E3 ubiquitin ligases that can be used in PROTAC technology is also one of the challenges that PROTAC faces . 3 . How to connect POI and E3 ligase ligand . Researchers have realized that the linkers can profoundly affect the activity , selectivity , and druggability of PROTAC molecules . How to ef ﬁ ciently design and connect POI and E3 ligase ligands is also an important issue . 4 . Pharmacological properties . The PROTAC molecule is usually not good enough as a drug due to its large molecular weight . How to optimize quickly is a huge challenge . 5 . PROTAC molecules generally have a “ hook ” effect . Can a reasonable molecular design be used to weaken or even eliminate this concentration - dependent problem ? Obviously , conventional medicinal chemistry screening and optimization methods are not suitable for the rapid development and optimization of PRTOAC molecules , especially for undruggable targets . Aiming at the above - mentioned problems , AI technology ( protein structure prediction ) , virtual drug screening technology and DEL screening technology , etc . can help develop the corresponding ligands for the target protein and E3 ligase . Based on these screened ligands , it is necessary to develop ef ﬁ cient synthesis methods to quickly and effectively construct large - scale PROTAC molecular libraries characterized by skeletal diversity for high - throughput screening and optimization of molecular drugg - ability . In terms of molecular design , the existing ternary complex structures of PROTAC molecule with POI and E3 ligase proteins are still very few . In the future , more complex information obtained by X - Ray or cryo - electron microscopy will help in better molecular design . In recent years , breakthroughs in the ability to predict the protein and related complex structure by alphafold2 may also contribute to the design of PROTACs . For molecular optimization , increasing the overall rigidity of the molecule and reducing the molecular weight can generally improve the drug - like properties of the hit compounds , such as oral bioavailability , ADME , etc . The second is about biological activity evaluation . This involves the screening of PROTAC molecules , evaluation of druggability , and pharmacological evaluation . 1 . PROTAC molecular screening . The existing technical meth - ods mainly rely on immunoblotting methods and proteo - mics methods , which are not only time - consuming , labor - intensive , low - ef ﬁ ciency , and high - cost . In recent years , screening technologies such as ﬂ uorescent tags and HiBiT have been gradually introduced . In the future , more new high - throughput and high - sensitivity methods are needed for rapid and accurate assessment . 2 . Evaluation of druggability . In addition to the conventional evaluation indicators such as solubility , in vitro and in vivo activity , toxicity , and other drug - like properties . The role of PROTAC is to catalyze the cycle , so traditional methods cannot accurately assess the properties of PROTAC ’ s PK and PD . For PROTAC molecules , there is a great need to develop PK / PD models that are more consistent with protein degradation as a new drug modality . 3 . How to better understand the degradation activity or degradability , selectivity , possible off - target effects , and pharmacological effects of PROTAC molecules ( based on different targets , different cell lines , and different animal models ) . And how to correspondingly achieve differentia - tion in clinical treatment . None of these discussed questions currently have ready - made answers , but we believe that as more and more research progresses , the whole ﬁ eld will be greatly advanced . With the development of more biological , pharmacological , and clinical research , new evaluation methods and systems will gradually be set up to solve these problems . It is believed that in the future , more and more PROTAC molecules will not only be used as tools for basic biological research but will also enter the clinic to solve the actual needs of patients .
