Elongation of Actin Filaments is a Diffusion - limited Reaction at the Barbed End and Is Accelerated by Inert Macromolecules * ( Received for publication , May 20 , 1986 ) Detlev DrenckhahnS and Thomas D . Pollard From the Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy , Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , Baltimore , Maryland 21205 We used a fluorescence method to measure the rate constants for the elongation of pyrene - labeled actin filaments in a number of different solvents . The abso - lute values of the rate constants were established by electron microscopy . Using glycerol , sucrose , or eth - ylene glycol to vary the solution viscosity , the associ - ation rate constant ( k , ) was lo7 M” s” viscosity” ( in centipoise ) . Consequently , plots of llk , versus viscosity are linear and extrapolate to near the origin as ex - pected for a diffusion - limited reaction where the rate constant approaches infinity at zero viscosity . By elec - tron microscopy , we found that this inhibitory effect of glycerol is almost entirely at the fast growing , barbed end . For the pointed end , plots of 1 / k + versus viscosity extrapolate to a maximum rate of about lo6 M” s” at zero viscosity , so that elongation at the pointed is not limited by diffusion . In contrast to these small molecules , polyethylene glycol , dextran , and ovalbumin all cause a concentration ( and therefore viscosity ) - dependent increase in k , . At any given vis - cosity , their effects are similar to each other . For ex - ample , at 3 centipoise , k , = 2 . 2 % lo7 “’ s” . We presume that this is due to an excluded volume effect that causes an increase in the thermodynamic activity of the actin . If the proteins in the cytoplasmic matrix have a similar effect , the association reactions of actin in cells may be much faster than expected from exper - iments done in dilute buffers . The large association rate constants for elongation at both ends of actin filaments raised the question of whether these reactions are diffusion - limited processes ( Pollard and Moo - seker , 1981 ) . The filaments polymerize bidirectionally with the rate at the fast end about 10 times larger than at the slow end . The fast end is the barbed ( B ) , end and the slow end is the pointed ( P ) end ( Woodrum et al . , 1975 ) , relative to the arrowhead - shaped complexes of myosin with actin filaments ( Huxley , 1963 ) . By electron microscopy , the association rate constant for ATP - actin at the barbed end is k + B = 10’ M” s - I , whereas k , ’ = lo6 M” s” in KC1 and MgC12 at pH 7 ( Pollard and Mooseker , 1981 ; Bonder et al . , 1983 ) . These values can be compared with theoretical values calculated from the Debeye - Smoluchowski expression : k , = 4 ~ k feiec b ( D , + DF ) No ( 1 ) _ _ ~ * This work was supported by a grant from the Muscular Dystrophy Association of America and National Institutes of Health Grant GM - 28338 ( to T .

For the addition of an actin monomer to the end of an actin filament , DM = 5 X cm2 s - ’ ( Lanni et al . , 1981 ; Tait and Frieden , 1982 ) , DF < lo - ’ cm’ s” ( Tait and Frieden , 1982 ) , and b is assumed to be about 2 x 10” cm based on the shape of the actin molecule ( Smith et al . , 1984 ) . If k and felec have values of unity , then the rate constant for elongation will equal that for collision and have a value of 7 . 5 X lo8 M” s” . However , the correct orientation of the reacting molecules is essential so that k is more likely to have a value of low4 to 10” ( Berg and von Hippel , 1985 ) , so k + will be in the range of 7 . 5 x lo4 to 7 . 5 X lo7 M” s - ’ . These predictions put the observed values for k + B and k + ’ well within the range for diffusion - limited reactions . Since D is an inverse function of viscosity , one can test for a diffusion - limited process by evaluating the dependence of the reaction rate on viscosity ( see Berg and von Hippel ( 1985 ) for a review of diffusion - limited processes ) . To do so for actin polymerization , we measured the elongation rate and rate constants in several different solutes with a range of viscosi - ties and also over a rapge of temperatures . We also evaluated felec by determining the rate constants over a wide range of salt concentrations . We found that the rate constants for both subunit associ - ation and dissociation at the barbed end of actin filaments scale with inverse viscosity in glycerol , sucrose , and ethylene glycol , as expected for a diffusion - limited process . The de - pendence of the rate on the temperature is explained in part by the viscosity , but there is also a chemical activation process with an activation energy of about 3 . 5 kcal / mol . Above 50 mM KC1 , salt inhibits elongation in a concentration - depend - ent fashion so electrostatic interactions are also an important factor in the process . Elongation at the pointed end also depends on the viscosity but is not diffusion - limited . Several macromolecules ( ovalbumin , polyethylene glycol , and dex - tran ) all increase the elongation rate in spite of the fact that they also increase the viscosity . This is presumably caused by an excluded volume effect that increases the thermodynamic activity of the actin ( reviewed by Minton ( 1983 ) ) . Conse - quently , actin polymerization inside cells may occur much more rapidly than expected from previous work in dilute buffers . MATERIALS AND METHODS The solutes used in these experiments came from the following suppliers and were used without further purification : dextran T - 40 ( & fr = 40 , 000 ) ( Pharmacia Fine Chemicals , Uppsala , Sweden ) ; ethyl - ene glycol , glycerol , polyethylene glycol 6000 , and sucrose ( J . T . Baker Chemical Co . , Phillipsburg , NJ ) ; ovalbumin ( Sigma ) .

Acanthamoeba actin was purified from sucrose extracts ( Pollard , 1984 ) . Part of the actin was labeled with pyrene iodoacetamide ( Pollard , 1984 ) and used at 1 - 5 % of the total actin in the fluorescence assay for polymerized actin ( Kouyama and Mihashi , 1981 ) . Unless noted otherwise , the polymerization reactions were carried out in standard buffer ( 50 mM KCI , 1 mM MgCI2 , 1 mM EGTA , ' 0 . 5 mM dithiothreitol , 0 . 1 mM CaCI , , 0 . 1 - 0 . 2 mM ATP , 10 mM imidazole ( pH 7 ) . The steady state extent of polymerization and initial rate of elongation from unlabeled actin filament nuclei were measured fluo - rometrically , usually at 20 " C ( Pollard , 1983 ) . Most of the solutes affected the fluorescence intensity of pyrene - labeled actin , so all data are corrected . All plots of elongation rate versus concentration of actin monomer were linear , except for those in high concentrations of ovalbumin . In that case , the elongation rate constants were calcu - lated from the critical concentrations and rates at 1 . 2 PM actin . Absolute rates of elongation were measured by electron microscopy using bundles of actin filaments from Limulus sperm as nuclei ( see Pollard and Cooper ( 1984 ) ) except that the reaction was carried out directly on the electron microscopy grid and was stopped by inversion of the grid onto a large volume of 5 mM spermine ( Sigma ) in standard buffer to aggregate the filaments grown from the ends of the Limulus bundles . The details of this method will be presented in another paper . , The viscosities of glycerol - and sucrose - containing solutions were taken from standard tables . The viscosities of the other solutions were measured in a Cannon - Manning semimicroviscometer ( Cannon Instruments Co . , State College , PA ) at 20 " C . All linear plots were fit by least squares linear regression . RESULTS Sucrose , glycerol , and ethylene glycol all inhibit the elon - gation of rabbit muscle actin filaments but have little ( su - crose ) or no ( glycerol and ethylene glycol ) measurable effect on the critical concentration for polymerization evaluated by either steady state or initial rate methods ( Table I ) . Similar results were obtained with glycerol solutions using Acantha - moeba actin . The rate constants for association and dissocia - tion were determined from the dependence of the initial rate of elongation from actin filament nuclei on the actin monomer concentration . In all three solutes , k , scales as an inverse function of viscosity ( Fig . 1 , open symbols ) . Plots of k + - ' uersus viscosity are linear , and all extrapolate to near the origin ( Fig . 2B ) . The origin corresponds to an infinite rate constant at zero viscosity . Since the critical concentration is constant , k - also scales with viscosity in exactly the same way as k , , otherwise the system would violate the principle of reversible thermodynamics . The absolute value of k , in standard buffer at 20 " C was io7 M " s - ' in parallel electron microscopy experiments , and all of these plots were normalized to this value . Similar experiments by electron microscopy using glycerol to vary the viscosity showed that elongation at the barbed end is an inverse function of viscosity that plots of ( k ~ , ~ ) " uersus viscosity extrapolate to near the origin ( Fig . 2A ( 0 ) and Fig . 3 ) . Elongation at the pointed end is only weakly dependent on the viscosity . Plots of ( k , ' ) " uersus viscosity do not extrapolate to the origin ( Fig . 2A ( 0 ) ) . Instead , the value of k , ' at zero viscosity is about IO6 M " s - * . In standard buffer , the elongation rate but not the critical concentration depends on the temperature ( Fig . 4 , A and B ) . This is true for both muscle and Acanthamoeba actin . From the dependence of k , on the temperature , the activation energy for elongation is 8 . 5 kcal / mol ( Fig . 4B , inset , and Table 11 ) . Using the temperature to vary the viscosity in standard buffer , lo % glycerol , plots of k + - ' uersus viscosity are linear ' The abbreviation used is : EGTA , [ ethylenebis ( oxyethylene - nitrilo ) ] tetraacetic acid .

Above 20 " C , k , is larger than expected from the temperature de - pendence of the viscosity alone ; whereas below 20 " C , the opposite is true . If the values for k , as a function of temper - ature are corrected by a factor of viscosity " , the average activation energy is 3 . 5 kcal / mol . Contrary to the effect of small solutes , all three macromo - lecular solutes that we tested increased the rate of elongation , in spite of the fact that they all increase the viscosity ( Fig . 1 , filled symbols ) . When plotted as a function of their viscosity , all three macromolecules had similar effects on elongation . Note that the difference between the small solutes and mac - romolecules can be considerable . For example , at a viscosity of 3 centipoise , elongation is almost 6 times faster in dextran , ovalbumin , or polyethylene glycol than in ethylene glycol , glycerol , or sucrose . Dextran and ovalbumin did not change the critical concentration for polymerization , whereas poly - ethylene glycol decreased the critical concentration to a small extent as described previously ( Stromqvist et al . , 1984 ) .

To evaluate the electrostatic factor ( felec ) , the rate constants were measured over a wide range of KC1 concentrations ( Fig . 6 ) . The optimal concentration of KC1 for elongation in 1 mM MgC12 is 50 mM , and k , declines at higher concentrations of KCl . Both h , and k - vary with salt concentration , but their ratio , the critical concentration , is relatively constant at 0 . 16 - 0 . 34 pM . DISCUSSION In the small solutes that we tested , the elongation rate at the barbed end ( R ' ) of an actin filament is RB = ( / z + ~ ( AJ - kB ) viscosity " ( 2 ) with the viscosity in centipose .

Measurement was by the fluorescence method . The doshed line is the average of the three plots in Fig . 2 . reaction at the barbed end is highly favorable and under optimal conditions limited only by diffusion . Assuming that felec is 1 , the steric factor k is rather large , about 0 . 02 . Inter - preted physically , 2 % of the collisions of monomers with the end of a filament lead to binding , a high efficiency considering that the incoming subunit will rarely be oriented correctly to bind to the end of the filament . At first glance , it seems remarkable that dissociation of subunits from the barbed end of the filament is also a diffu - sion - limited process . However , there are at least two reason - able explanations . First , the dissociation reaction must in - volve diffusion of the exiting subunit away from the vicinity of the filament end . To the extent that this movement is limited by the viscosity of the medium , the molecule may fail to move away fast enough to escape rather than rebinding . Second , the dissociation reaction may require that the ter - minal subunit be in a particular conformation to break its bonds with its neighbors . Since some intramolecular motions are driven by collisions of solvent with the surface , the rate of conformational fluctuations and therefore the frequency of some states will depend in part on the viscosity of the medium . At the pointed end of actin filaments , the elongation reac - tion is probably not diffusion - limited since k , ' is not an inverse function of viscosity and its absolute value is much smaller than at the barbed end . The mechanism can only be guessed at , but it is likely to be a multistep process with some steps independent of the viscosity . The extrapolated value of the rate constant at zero viscosity is about lo6 M - ' s - ' . This I Critical concentration , UM 0 p " , , ~ p " o , " I 0 100 200 300 500 UCI , mM FIG . 6 .

The existence of these additional steps may account for the slower rate compared with the barbed end where the collision rate seems to be the limiting step . The activation energy of 8 . 5 kcal / mol is higher than ex - pected for a diffusion - limited reaction ( - 5 kcal / mol for reac - tions in water from 0 to 37 " C ) . When corrected for the effect of temperature on viscosity , actin filament elongation has a small activation energy of 3 . 5 kcal / mol that can be attributed to chemical activation of the reactants . Presumably , temper - ature affects the conformation and / or dynamics of either the monomers or filament ends or both . Although temperature affects the rates of the elongation reactions , it does not change the critical concentration in our standard polymerization buffer as it does under other conditions ( see Korn ( 1982 ) ) . Hence , in MgC12 , the apparent equilibrium constant is tem - perature - independent , AH = 0 , and the reaction is driven by AS as shown previously by others ( see Korn ( 1982 ) ) . Electrostatic forces are a factor in the binding of subunits to the end of filaments since k + declines toward zero at high concentrations of salt . Consequently , the felec term in Equation 1 is less than 1 , and the unitless steric factor ( k ) in Equation 1 is actually larger than 0 . 02 . In terms of the biological functions of actin , the effect of macromolecules on elongation rates is probably our most important new observation . At a total protein concentration like that in the cytoplasm , elongation may be 10 times faster than expected for a solution of that viscosity . As in the case of some other biochemical reactions that are accelerated by inert macromolecules , this is probably an excluded volume effect ( reviewed by Minton ( 1983 ) ) . The inert macromolecules increase the thermodynamic activity of the actin and thereby increase its effective concentration . This effect can be sub - stantial , on the order of 10 - fold . Consequently , inside cells , both association and dissociation may occur at vastly higher rates than expected from previous measurements of rate con - stants in dilute buffers .

If the thermodynamic activity of actin is 10 times higher than its concentration , then even conservative estimates regarding the monomer concentration are consist - ent with the growth rate that they observed .
