The protein expression pattern of phospho - LIMK1 ( p - LIMK1 ) , the active form of LIMK1 , in intractable temporal lobe epilepsy ( TLE ) , however , is unknown . Here we measured p - LIMK1 protein expression in thirty temporal neocortex tissue samples from intractable TLE patients , fifteen histologically normal temporal neocortex tissue samples from trauma patients without epilepsy , in the hippocampi of lithium chloride / pilocarpine - induced TLE rats , and in controls . We found that p - LIMK1 was expressed mainly in the cytoplasm of neurons . The protein expression of p - LIMK1 was sig - nificantly higher in the TLE patients and rats than in the control groups . Our results suggest that p - LIMK1 might be involved in the pathogenesis of intractable TLE . Keywords : Lim kinase - 1 , phospho - LIMK1 , intractable temporal lobe epilepsy , lithium chloride , pilocarpine Introduction Epilepsy is characterized by recurrent sponta - neous seizures . Of the epilepsy patients receiv - ing anti - epileptic drugs ( AEDs ) , 20 - 30 % still have seizures and most of them will progress to intractable temporal lobe epilepsy ( TLE ) [ 1 ] . The pathogenesis of intractable TLE , however , is still unclear . Abnormalities in dendritic spines , axons and synaptic plasticity have commonly been observed in brain specimens from epilepsy patients and epileptic animal models [ 2 - 5 ] . Interestingly , Lim kinase - 1 ( LIMK1 ) plays a criti - cal role in dendritic spine morphogenesis and brain function . LIMK1 is a cytoplasmic serine / threonine kinase expressed in neurons of the central nervous system ( CNS ) [ 6 ] . Phospho - LIMK1 ( p - LIMK1 ) is an active form of LIMK1 that is phosphorylated at the site of threonine 508 by Rho GTPases [ 7 , 8 ] . Meanwhile , p - LIMK1 phosphorylates and thus inactivates cofilin and actin - depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) , which are key regulators of actin cytoskeleton dynamics that have been implicated in growth cone motil - ity and neurite extension [ 9 ] . Extensive evi - dence has shown that LIMK1 is important to increase the number of dendritic spines , stimu - late the growth of axons and dendrites [ 10 ] , sustain mature synapses [ 11 ] and change the hippocampal long - term potentiation ( LTP ) [ 12 ] . Thus , we hypothesized that p - LIMK1 might par - ticipate in the pathogenesis of TLE . This study was designed to determine the expression pat - tern of p - LIMK1 in intractable TLE patients and in experimental TLE rats . Materials and methods Patients In this study , thirty human brain samples were selected randomly from our epilepsy brain bank , which consists of 300 brain samples from patients with intractable TLE who were refractory to the maximal doses of three or more AEDs including valproic acid , phenobarbi - tal , phenytoin , carbamazepine , clonazepam , topiramate , lamotrigine , oxcarbazepine , and gabapentin . All patients had typical clinical manifestations and characteristic electroen - Phospho - Lim kinase 1 and intractable temporal lobe epilepsy 626 Int J Clin Exp Med 2015 ; 8 ( 1 ) : 625 - 633 cephalograms ( EEGs ) . The diagnosis of seizure types was based on the 1981 International Classification of Epilepsy Seizures of the International League Against Epilepsy . Prior to the resection of temporal lobe tissue , patients were subjected to pre - surgical assessments consisting of the historic details of seizures , neurological examination , interictal and ictal EEG studies , neuroradiological studies , and neuropsychological tests . The epileptic lesion was localized in each patient through brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) or comput - nosed by licensed pathologists as brain trauma and had no prior history of seizures , exposure to AEDs , or other neurologic disorders . Two neurologists reviewed all of the medical records of these patients and none of them developed epilepsy after the trauma . Table 2 shows the clinical features of the control group of patients . Informed consents were obtained from all patients or their guardians for the surgery treat - ment and for the use of brain tissue for research purposes . The protocol of this study complied Table 1 .

The research was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki of the World Medical Association . A rat model of TLE Forty six adult male Sprague - Dawley rats , aged 8 weeks and weighing 180 - 220 g , were obtained from the Experimental Animal Center of Chongqing Medical University . All experimen - tal procedures were performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Care Committee and the Ethical Commission of Chongqing Medical University . Rats were ran - domly divided into eight groups , including one control group and seven epilepsy - induced sub - groups stratified by the period of time since sei - zure : 1 / 4 , 1 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 30 , and 60 days ( n = 8 in the control and 60 - day groups ; n = 5 in the remaining subgroups ) . TLE rats were induced by lithium chloride ( LiCl , 127 mg / kg , Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) and pilocarpine ( 50 mg / kg , Sigma - Aldrich ) according to the refractory TLE model [ 13 ] . The control rats were treated with normal saline , instead of pilocarpine . The rats with continuous generalized tonic seizures at stages 4 or 5 according to Racineâ€™s standard criteria [ 14 ] , but without normal behavior between seizures , were defined as status epi - lepticus and were included in the study of acute period of TLE . A video recording system was used to monitor the spontaneous recurrent sei - zures of the model rats in chronic period of TLE ( 12 h / day , for 3 days ) . Those rats with sponta - neous recurrent seizures in chronic period were also included in the study . The induced epilep - tic rats were sacrificed at 1 / 4 , 1 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 30 , and 60 days after seizures , while the control group of rats were sacrificed at day 1 , and the brain tissues were removed for analysis . Tissue processing All human brain tissues and the bilateral hip - pocampus of forty rats ( 5 per group ) were divid - ed into two portions . One portion was immedi - ately stored in liquid nitrogen for Western blot assay . The other portion was fixed in 4 % para - formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin for immunohistochemistry and terminal deoxynu - cleotydyl transferase mediated dUTP nick - end - labeling ( TUNEL ) staining . The remaining six rat brains from the control and 60 - day groups ( 3 per group ) were selected for visualization of the dendrite morphology by Golgi staining . Immunohistochemistry Primary polyclonal rabbit anti - p - LIMK1 anti - body ( 1 : 100 , Abcam , USA ) was used for detect - ing the immunoreactivity of p - LIMK1 by immu - nohistochemistry [ 15 ] . Neurons with buffy staining in the cytoplasm were defined as posi - tive for p - LIMK1 . Ten visual fields of every sec - tion were chosen randomly under the LEICA DM6000B automatic microscope , and the opti - cal density ( OD ) values of immunoreactivity were analyzed automatically and semi - quanti - tatively using Image Pro - Plus 6 . 0 pathology image analysis system . Western blot analysis Total protein were separated by 10 % SDS - PAGE and electrotransferred to PVDF membranes . The membranes were incubated with primary polyclonal rabbit anti - LIMK1 ( 1 : 100 , Santa Cruz , USA ) , anti - p - LIMK1 ( 1 : 50 , Abcam ) , or anti - Î² - actin antibody ( 1 : 1000 , Santa Cruz ) at 4Â°C overnight . The membranes were washed and then incubated with an HRP - labeled goat anti - rabbit secondary antibody ( 1 : 4000 , Zhongshan Golden Bridge , Inc . ) . The immunoreactive Table 2 .

There was no significant difference in age ( t = 0 . 03 , P = 0 . 976 ) and sex ( Chi - square = 0 . 000 , P = 1 . 000 ) between TLE group and control group . Measurement of p - LIMK1 in the hippocampus of TLE rat model by immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemistry showed that p - LIMK1 was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm of neu - rons . In the hippocampi of TLE rats , compared to control group , the p - LIMK1 protein was up - regulated at 6 hours , followed by a decrease to the level of control rats at 24 hours , and up - regulated at 72 hours , then it decreased at 7 and 14 days and up - regulated at 30 and 60 days again . Besides 24 hours , 7 and 14 days , the p - LIMK1 protein expression in the hippo - campi of TLE rats at the remaining post - seizure time points was significantly higher than that in control rats ( P < 0 . 05 , Figure 1A and 1C ) . In the temporal neocortex , the intractable TLE patients exhibited significantly higher p - LIMK1 immunoreactivity than that in the control group ( P < 0 . 05 , Figure 1B and 1D ) . LIMK1 and p - LIMK1 protein measured by Western blot assay The LIMK1 protein in the hippocampi of TLE rats was enhanced after seizures , and was sig - nificantly different between TLE rats and con - trols at each time point after seizures ( P < 0 . 05 , Figure 2A and 2B ) . Also , the LIMK1 protein was significantly higher in TLE patients than in con - trols ( P < 0 . 05 , Figure 2C and 2D ) . The temporal expression pattern of p - LIMK1 protein in the hippocampi of TLE rats was eval - uated at different times following seizures . It followed the same trend as the results of the Immunohistochemistry . The p - LIMK1 protein were significantly different between TLE rats and controls at each time point after seizures ( P < 0 . 05 ) , except for 24 hours , 7 and 14 days ( Figure 3A and 3B ) . The p - LIMK1 protein enhanced in intractable TLE patients compared to controls ( P < 0 . 05 , Figure 3C and 3D ) . Apoptotic neurons in the temporal neocortex of patients The number of TUNEL - positive apoptotic neu - rons in the temporal neocortex of intractable TLE patients was significantly greater than in controls ( P < 0 . 05 , Figure 4A and 4C ) . Dendrite morphology in the hippocampus of rats by Golgi staining The dendrite length in CA1 and CA3 regions of the 60 - day group was significantly greater than in the control group ( P < 0 . 05 , Figure 4B and 4D ) . Discussion In the CNS , changes in size , shape , structure and the number of dendritic spines have been implicated in synaptic plasticity and LTP , which are strongly correlated to the pathological basis of epilepsy [ 3 ] . Since LIMK1 plays a critical role in dendritic spine morphogenesis , synaptic plasticity and brain function [ 19 ] , the expres - sion pattern of p - LIMK1 , the active form of LIMK1 , in TLE patients is of great interest . In this study , we observed up - regulation of LIMK1 and p - LIMK1 protein in TLE patients compared to controls . We speculate that the up - regulation of p - LIMK1 protein in TLE patients may be associated with phosphorylation regu - lation by proteins upstream of LIMK1 . P - LIMK1 can phosphorylate ADF / cofilin and remodel actin filaments , which can cause the formation of excitatory loops and seizure focus [ 5 ] . At the same time , we observed the number of apop - totic neurons increased in the temporal neocor - tex of TLE patients . Thus , the up - regulation of p - LIMK1 protein in TLE patients may be associ - ated with neuronal apoptosis , which was con - sistent with findings that activation of LIMK1 plays a role during cell apoptosis [ 20 ] . In the rat model of TLE , we found that expression of LIMK1 protein increased after seizures . However , the expression of p - LIMK1 protein fluctuated during the acute period ( increased at 6 and 72 hours , decreased at 24 hours ) , decreased during the latent period ( days 7 and 14 ) , then increased during the chronic period ( days 30 and 60 ) . Also , we found the dendrite length in CA1 and CA3 regions increased dur - ing the chronic period ( 60 days ) . We speculate that the fluctuations in expression of p - LIMK1 during the acute period may be associated with oxidative stress induced by LiCl and pilocarpine [ 21 ] and the release of neurotransmitters due to the auto - regulation of blood - brain barrier permeability induced by pilocarpine [ 22 ] . The Phospho - Lim kinase 1 and intractable temporal lobe epilepsy 632 Int J Clin Exp Med 2015 ; 8 ( 1 ) : 625 - 633 down - regulation of p - LIMK1 during the latent period may be associated with alterations in growth cone formation , neuritogenesis , synap - tic dysfunction , and changes in LTP in hippo - campus . The up - regulation of p - LIMK1 during the chronic period might be correlated to the abnormal length of dendrites in CA1 and CA3 regions of hippocampi , resulting in the abnor - mal function of synaptic connections and the formation of aberrant collaterals of granule cells . This series of alterations in p - LIMK1 may result in remodeling of the cytoskeleton accom - panied by changes in synaptic plasticity and LTP , and eventually leading to epilepsy . Normal development of the CNS is dependent on the presence of LIMK1 , whose deletion or mutation has been implicated in the develop - ment of the human genetic disorder Williams syndrome [ 23 ] . P - LIMK1 regulates actin cyto - skeletal dynamics by inhibiting the activity of ADF / cofilins [ 9 ] , and its role is closely related to synapse formation and function [ 19 ] . In the cur - rent study , the results of immunohistochemis - try revealed that p - LIMK1 were expressed mainly in the cytoplasm of neurons . These data demonstrated that p - LIMK1 activity in the cyto - plasm might regulate actin cytoskeletal dynam - ics , synaptic plasticity and LTP , which are strongly correlated to the pathology of epilepsy . In conclusion , we confirmed that the abnormal expression of p - LIMK1 protein could be seen in TLE patients and LiCl / pilocarpine - induced TLE rats . These results indicate that p - LIMK1 might be involved in the pathogenesis of intractable TLE . The exact pathophysiological mechanism through which p - LIMK1 participates in the development of TLE , however , warrants further studies in the future .
