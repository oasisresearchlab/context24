Smart phones equipped proximity sensors can be used to enable contact tracing , however accuracy of detection and energy eiciency is a key challenge . To address this challenge , we propose an accurate energy - eicient contact tracing ( AECT ) algorithm that detects which users came in contact with an infected user by performing computations at the server - side . Additionally , the AECT algorithm uses the wireless scan method , which calculates proximity based on pseudo - range multilateration and makes relevant comparisons with the matching score ( MS ) method based on the computation of received signal strength indication ( RSSI ) metric . Simulation results demonstrate that the scan method ( AECT ) is highly accurate and outperforms the scan method , highlighting that real distance is a better metric in contact tracing than a proxy for distance such as RSSI . Lastly , simulation results also demonstrate that the scan method ( AECT ) is 16 times more energy - eicient than the baseline 1 Hz frequency method , and we recommend it as a method of choice for performing contact tracing against infectious diseases such as COVID - 19 .

Today COVID - 19 has already spread throughout all the major countries and regions across the world [ 1 , 18 ] . In this regard , according to a report by World Health Organization ( WHO ) , the highly infectious and contagious coronavirus outbreak was declared a major łpandemicž on March 11 , 2020 . Moreover , WHO reported that the number of people who have tested positive for the coronavirus has surged , reaching 219 million , and coronavirus has already claimed the lives of almost 4 . 55 million people as of September 10 , 2021 across the world . To mitigate the spread of COVID - 19 , safety measures such as lockdowns , stay home orders , and quarantines have been implemented by major countries across the world , resulting in the crippling of national as well as world economy with dire consequences and a bleak future for employers , workers , and investors [ 8 , 31 ] . Infectious diseases such as COVID - 19 spread through human contact , including respiratory droplets or bodily luids from infected individuals and coming in contact with surfaces or materials contaminated by these luids . Concerning COVID - 19 , contact tracing is simply deined as means of inding out if a healthy person came in contact with an infectious person in the past or not [ 2 , 21 ] .

The need of the hour is to isolate the infected individuals from the crowd to mitigate the spread of COVID - 19 . In the past , contact tracing has proven to be an efective tool to control infectious diseases , including Ebola , SARS - CoV - 1 , and H1N1 . Moreover , contact tracing can be utilized to create social networks depending on the frequency of human - to - human contact [ 15 , 36 ] . With the advancement in the area of Internet of Things ( IoT ) and computing , quick contact tracing is possible [ 7 , 12ś14 , 16 , 22 , 24ś26 ] . Furthermore , an array of technologies , such as short - range wireless idelity ( WiFi ) and Bluetooth ( BT ) , as well as long - range global positioning systems ( GPS ) , can be used to implement contact tracing . In this regard , GPS provides a greater coverage area , and it is ideal for implementing contact tracing in outdoor environments [ 17 , 28 ] . However , GPS lacks data concerning indoor environments ; thus , short - range BT and WiFi devices become desirable for performing contact tracing inside indoor environments . Additionally , most COVID - 19 infections occur inside closely packed indoor spaces instead of outdoor spaces , which provide the edge for the aforementioned short - range wireless technologies for the implementation of contact tracing [ 4 , 33 ] . 1 . 1 Related Work In open technical literature , many works have considered contact tracing to detect COVID - 19 as outlined in [ 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 9ś11 , 18ś20 , 23 , 27 , 30 , 32 , 34 , 35 ] . In [ 34 ] , the authors investigated the process of collecting contact tracing data for COVID - 19 from a crowdsourcing perspective . In this regard , the motivating users can contribute more contact tracing data , resultantly the contact tracing system ensures users’ privacy and data processing cost with the total reward value , and then the users will choose their response strategies based on it . Moreover , the authors formulated the problem as the so - called Stackelberg game and showed that there exists the Nash equilibrium for any user given any ixed reward value . Furthermore , the authors presented an incentive algorithm called CovidCrowd , which computed the optimal reward value to maximize the utility of the proposed system . Similarly , in [ 9 ] , the authors introduced the QUEST system capable of empowering organizations to monitor individuals and spaces to implement policies for social distancing and contact tracing using WiFi connectivity data in a passive and privacy - preserving manner . Thus , the authors aimed to ensure the safety of employees and occupants at an organization while guaranteeing the privacy of all parties . The authors in [ 2 ] , proposed a privacy - preserving contact tracing mechanism for infection detection , which enabled the users to discretely and securely upload their data to the server . After that , if one user got infected , other users can check if they came in contact with the infected user in the past . Moreover , the authors’ scheme used a matching score to represent the result of the contact tracing and used a weight - based matching method to enhance the score’s accuracy . In this regard , the authors also showed the inaccuracy of their approach based on received signal strength indication ( RSSI ) , especially for a lower number of routers . Likewise , in [ 3 ] , the authors examined many smartphone applications intending to contain the spread of the COVID - 19 . Notably , the authors examined diferent types of permission these smartphone applications require for tracking and tracing users , how mobile data from the user end is transferred to the analytic center and the security measures put in place by these applications to safeguard the privacy and security of end - users . In [ 18 ] , the authors developed a Q - learning - based tool for safe navigation ( S - Nav ) , which suggested traversing through alternate routes in a road network in a bid to cut of the travelling time through COVID - 19 hotspots . Additionally , the S - Nav system accepted the starting point and the ending point of the journey from the commuter and generated a safe travelling path to ensure minimum commuter exposure to COVID - 19 . The authors presented the reinforcement learning model with reward function and penalties associated with hotspots to achieve this task . Moreover , the authors showed the convergence of the S - Nav system under diferent conditions and demonstrated its eicacy . ACM Trans . Sensor Netw . AECT : Accurate Energy Eficient Contact Tracing Using Smart Phones for Infectious Disease Detection • 3 In [ 23 ] , the authors proposed a novel contact tracing mechanism for detecting CO VID - 19 based on the geolocation data of mobile users . In this regard , the authors focused on the privacy preservation of mobile users by eliminating the need to use mobile applications . Moreover , the authors showed their proposed technique yielded better results than the traditional contact tracing solutions based on mobile applications . Similarly , in [ 35 ] , the authors considered mobile contact tracing applications ( MCTA ) which jointly utilize mobile and social media networks to identify an infected person . Furthermore , the authors pondered and posed critical questions relating to privacy concerns surrounding MCTA , which could ultimately become a massive surveillance tool for the governments after the pandemic . In [ 30 ] , the authors provided an in - depth technical overview of the existing solutions that are currently deployed for contact tracing for wearables . Moreover , the author highlighted the main diferences between centralized contact tracing and decentralized tracing approaches in terms of accuracy and privacy considerations , as well as user willingness to adopt these methods . Additionally , the authors shed some light on the utility of wearables in mitigating the spread of a highly contagious coronavirus . The authors , in [ 11 ] , proposed a new internet of things ( IoT ) - based architecture to perform contact tracing and then the eiciency of the model is evaluated compared to the traditional epidemiological models . Moreover , the authors demonstrated by simulations that IoT - based contact tracing is a promising solution to combat infectious diseases like COVID - 19 . In [ 10 ] , the authors reviewed various contact tracing approaches used by diferent governments around the globe to monitor and control the spread of this disease in their respective countries or territories . Subsequently , the authors discussed the limitations , legal and ethical issues that arise due to the usage of digital contact tracing methods . The authors introduced a novel IoT - based framework in [ 27 ] due to its ubiquity for contact tracing , which incorporates symptom - based detection . The authors demonstrated that the proposed framework performed accurate contact tracing by merging real - time symptom information extracted from IoT devices with conirm COVID - 19 infected cases extracted from medical tests to safe resources such as COVID - 19 test kits . In [ 32 ] , the authors pondered on the critical question of How to ight against the COVID - 19 pandemic with 5G Technologies ? In this regard , the authors presented several use - cases of moulding 5G systems and IoT - related technologies to ight COVID - 19 . Moreover , using the aforementioned technologies , the authors proposed innovative solutions in the areas of contact tracing , factory automation , e - tourism , e - government and supply chain management . Additionally , the authors envisioned that the proposed solution would be sustainable as well as instrumental and will become a part of our daily lives in the post - pandemic world . In [ 19 ] , the authors argued that minimizing the close human contact could signiicantly reduce the chances of catching the COVID - 19 . This phenomenon of reducing close physical contact is known as social distancing . In this regard , the authors presented a brief background of social distancing , its measuring methods and practical social distancing scenarios . Moreover , the authors presented measurement models utilizing wireless technologies to perform symptom prediction , contact tracing as well as monitoring quarantined people . Similarly , in [ 20 ] , the authors increased the scope of social distancing measurement methods and protocols to include the latest technologies , including machine learning , thermal detection and heat signatures , computer vision as well as ultrasound . Furthermore , the authors discussed open challenges and issues concerning social distancing . They advocated for pandemic modes to be incorporated in next - generation 6G wireless systems , intelligent transportation systems , and smart homes to cope with pandemics as COVID - 19 . Comparably , in [ 5 ] , the authors presented a novel bidirectional contact tracing mechanism - based stochastic branching process model . The authors demonstrated that the proposed scheme is robust and can efectively control COVID - 19 by identifying the infected individual and other people who recently came in their proximity . Likewise , in [ 6 ] , the authors highlighted the most efective approaches for performing contact tracing as it is unstandardized worldwide . In this regard , the authors presented an overview of the key enabling technologies used for infection tracking and provided recommendations for some technologies based on the given scenarios .

Therefore , we study the contact tracing problem in the framework accuracy and energy eiciency to cover this gap . The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows : • We study the problem of contact tracing for COVID - 19 by proposing two methods named scan and matching score ( MS ) , respectively . Moreover , we propose an accurate energy - eicient contact tracing ( AECT ) algorithm based on the scan method . • We solve the contact tracing problem by our proposed AECT algorithm . Moreover , we design AECT algorithm to compute proximity based on pseudo - range multilateration technique . • We demonstrate that our proposed AECT algorithm yields a superior performance compared to other benchmark algorithm based on MS method . Moreover , its performance is comparable to that of the real distance method which is 100 % accurate . Concurrently , we also show through simulations that the AECT algorithm is almost 16 times more energy eicient compared to benchmark algorithm based on 1 Hz frequency method . 1 . 3 Organization and Nomenclature The organization of the paper is as follows .

AECT : Accurate Energy Eficient Contact Tracing Using Smart Phones for Infectious Disease Detection • 5 2 SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM FORMULATION We model a tw o - dimensional ( 2D ) system with an area  2  , where a total of  U users are equipped with smartphones are going about their business , walking around and periodically stopping . Moreover , some of the users’ smartphones have active BT denoted by  BT , which is used alongside stationary WiFi routers denoted by  WF to track user position . Furthermore , we assume that smartphones perform wireless scans . In this regard , a wireless scan is deined as the smartphone taking a record of the current time , its RSSI value and recording a distance to all WiFi routers and BT users 1 in range , plus their wireless IDs as well as the routers’ locations . Afterwards , these wireless scans are sent to the server at the end of the day for comparison if an infected user is identiied . Additionally , a wireless scan is performed after each 10 s of walking and 120 s of taking a rest to avoid a gap in information for resting users , resting users will , without rescanning , duplicate in their ledgers every 10 s information from the prior scan , but with the current timestamp , which is to be sent to the server later . Resultantly , it will enable the server to pair together more timestamps from diferent users , as discussed in the next subsection . The RSSI between a router and a user is deined as RSSI [ dBm ] = 10  log 10  +  0 , ( 1 ) where  is the signal decay exponent ,  is the distance between transmitter and receiver , and  0 is the received signal strength at  0 = 1 m distance from the transmitter , which we can calculate according to free space path loss ( FSPL ) given by  0 = 10 log 10  0 (cid:18)  4    ·  0 (cid:19) 2 ! , ( 2 ) where  0 is the transmission power in mW ,  is the speed of light in m / s ,   is the carrier frequency in Hz . 2 . 1 Contact tracing Now , we compute the RSSI diference ( RD ) between two diferent users for some ixed router as RD =  ︄(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) RSSI 1 + RSSI 2 2 ( RSSI 1 − RSSI 2 ) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) , ( 3 ) where  is the signal decay exponent as discussed before . Moreover , the matching score ( MS ) between two users at any given timestamp can be computed as MS =  ln (  − 1 ) , ( 4 ) where  is the average of the top three RD values over all routers and the number of common routers  , which must be at least 3 , otherwise the MS is not calculated , as it becomes inaccurate . Moreover , it is to be noted that for the direct dependency on RSSI , we see that a lower MS should correspond to a lower distance between two users . Furthermore , the rationale behind taking the average of the top three RD values instead of just the maximum is to mitigate the inherent inaccuracy of the RSSI method since diferent routers may have diferent power proiles and signal decay proiles due to buildings and other obstacles and propagators such as corridors . Additionally , two timestamps will almost never match exactly ; thus , we consider two timestamps to be equivalent if they are within 15 s of each other . For each user , MS is calculated at such time equivalence with the infected user . Consequently , we take the smallest value of all such MS values for each user to be the characteristic one , i . e . the one to determine the closest the user has been to the infected user over the course of the day . 1 Henceforth , both are referred to collectively as " routers " for conciseness .

Moreover , the proximity calculation is based on multilateration method 2 and the main steps of the algorithm are mentioned below . Algorithm 1 Accurate Energy Eicient Contact Tracing ( AECT ) Algorithm for COVID - 19 detection 1 : Given :  U users 2 : Given : Infected user index :  0 3 : Retrieve :  0 = { all user  0 ’s timestamps } 4 : for  0 ∈  0 do 5 : for  ∈ { all non - infected users } do 6 : Retrieve :  = { all user  ’s timestamps } 7 : Calculate :  = {  ∈  : |  −  0 | ≤ 15 } 8 : for  ∈  do 9 : Retrieve : User  0 ’s distances to all routers . 10 : Retrieve : User  ’s distances to all routers . 11 : Calculate : Proximity based on distance computed by the pseudo - range multilateration method . 12 : end for 13 : end for 14 : end for 15 : Return : User indices and matching scores sorted by matching score . As stated previously , each user uploads data to the server . Afterwards , the server performs contact tracing at the end of the day . In this regard ,  is calculated instantaneously , as it is easily vectorized . Thus , these steps are constant in time . Consequently , the main step of calculating the MS is easily vectorized in the number of routers for the RSSI method and hence also is constant in time . Moreover , the last sorting step is also largely independent of the number of elements it sorts and is performed only once . Hence we can consider it instantaneous , as it generally would be on any modern computer , even for millions of elements . Therefore , the algorithm’s complexity is only rooted in the three nested for - loops . Hence it’s big - O of the product of cardinalities of the sets over which the for - loops run . In this regard , since the cardinality of  changes with each  0 , it is hard to give it a deinitive average cardinality . In our model , no " friends , " i . e . users who intentionally walk with each other for extended periods , are assumed ; hence generally , (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)  (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) is in the low single digits for our 300 s simulation and can be neglected or can equated to one . Thus , time complexity is  ( |  0 | (  U − 1 ) ) , which is the best case . On the other hand , worst case is that every user intersects with the infected one at every  0 ∈  0 , where (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12)  (cid:12) (cid:12) (cid:12) equal |  0 | and hence time complexity will be  (cid:0) |  0 | 2 (  U − 1 ) (cid:1) . Lastly , the algorithm above assumes one infected user , so we can extend the time complexity to  I infected users easily since the whole algorithm above would have to be performed for each one . Then , the expressions inside the big - O expressions , whether using the best or worst case , will be multiplied by  I . 2 Multilateration is a localization technique based on measuring the time of arrival of an emitted signal at various spatially distributed sites to estimate the location of the signal source [ 29 ] .

Additionally , there are  U = 20 randomly moving users who randomly make periodical stops of random lengths . As discussed before , they each have a smartphone , and there are  WF = 20 WiFi routers in the area shown by blue squares , and  BT = 7 of the users have active Bluetooth , denoted by blue trajectories . Moreover , when a user is walking at   = 1 m / s , his walking direction changes when he hits the edge or after resting . At initialization and at each time a user restarts movement after resting , he is randomly assigned how long he will be walking before the next rest in the range of 15 − 200 s under the uniform distribution . Similarly , when a user stops , he is randomly assigned how long he will stay at rest in the range of 5 − 200 s under the uniform distribution . Furthermore , we set  0 = 100 mW ,  = 2 and   = 3 GHz , which gives  0 = 15 . 802 dBm . It is worth mentioning that the infected user is deined to be user one . For simplicity , we exclude the efect of the environment afecting how ACM Trans . Sensor Netw . 8 • Ranjha et al . many routers are in range .

Sorting of user IDs and distances for the MS method versus the scan method ( AECT ) versus the real method 4 . 2 Full random simulation In Fig . 2 , the circles are ordered top - down in each column by ascending proximity score . Moreover , MS refers to the original RSSI method described in the previous section , scan means recording real distances instead of MS at scan time , and real means recording real minimal distance overall time not only over wireless scans , i . e . it is by deinition 100 % accurate . Furthermore , the numbers shown immediately next to the circles denote the user ID . The real method has sorted the user IDs correctly as the distance in the last column is monotonously ascending , whereas the MS method does not sort the user IDs and their corresponding distances correctly in the second and the irst column , respectively , which shows it is inaccurate . Additionally , we notice that the diference between scan and real methods is not very big , which means that the scan method gives us a decent estimate of the real situation without using a lot of battery power as it is not performing wireless scans every second and it ACM Trans .

( c ) MS method does not give an ideal 1 - 1 representation of distance . is utilizing a smart algorithm which is AECT to determine when to perform a wireless scan . Now , for the scan method , which uses the AECT algorithm , the user IDs can be mapped by matching a line that goes from the MS method through the scan method and ends up at the real method , i . e . for the third row , we match user ID 19 which goes from the MS column to the scan column and ends up at the real column . Lastly , it also means that the discrepancy symbolized by the skew lines between MS and scan almost perfectly describes the inaccuracy of MS , and the RSSI is not an accurate method to determine the distance between diferent users . It is to be noticed that RSSI is an alternate to measuring distance and it is prone to error . 4 . 3 Controlled simulation for 2 users To further understand the meaning and efect of RSSI , we look at a specially controlled simulation where two users approach each other from opposite corners , as shown in Fig . 3 . In this simulation , three routers are placed : two are symmetrically relected about the user paths at their centers , whereas the third is askew . Moreover , in Fig . 3 , the " mean " curves in ( b ) and ( c ) refer to the original way of calculating  for eq . ( 4 ) , where the average of the top three RD values is taken . As we see , there is an enormous diference between routers 1 and 2 versus router three up to two orders of magnitude diference in MS , which goes to show how unreliable RSSI can be as a measure of distance . Furthermore , for routers 1 and 2 , we see MS increasing as the users get closer , which is the complete opposite of the desired behaviour . Moreover , we observe this behaviour for router 3 at large distances , which is less critical . In Fig . 3 ( c ) , we put this into perspective even more by plotting MS vs . distance . Here , the black stars denote the start , i . e .  = 1 . Aside from all the aforementioned , we also see that for router 3 the curve is not 1 - 1 because it does not return exactly over itself after the users pass each other . 4 . 4 Monte Carlo random simulation To get a quantitative estimate of how inaccurate the RSSI method is , we performed 1000 full random simulations . Moreover , the accuracy metric we used is simple : each simulation outputs a rank for each user ; we take the absolute value of the diference between a given rank number and real rank number , then we sum up such values over all the users . Furthermore , the histograms in Fig . 4 represent the resulting metrics overall simulations , and we split the data up into real distance ranges , i . e . we have separate histograms for diferent ranges of the real distances between normal users and the infected user in meters . Consequently , we can also evaluate whether ACM Trans . Sensor Netw . 10 • Ranjha et al . Fig . 4 . Histograms for accuracy for the MS and scan methods . RSSI is worse for closer or farther distances . Generally , both methods perform better for medium distances up to 30 m but slightly worse for distances greater than 30 m or 30 + m . Additionally , judging by the mode values , we see that the scan method performs noticeably better with far less error than MS . Moreover , the same can be said judging by the noticeably smaller stretch factor of the scan histograms vs . MS , i . e . , the values are much more concentrated around the mode for the former . Now , we also provide an estimate of the energy consumption of the scanning method ( AECT ) shown in Fig . 5 . We evaluate the number of scans performed and do not cater to the counting of cloned timestamps used for resting users as scans because no energy is used and no actual wireless scan is performed ; only a new entry is added to the user’s log . Moreover , we perform overall 1000 simulations , each of 300 s with a total of 20 users . Afterwards , we average out over 18 scans performed per user , and scans are performed after every 10 s for moving users and much rarer for resting users once per 120 s . Hence , the average is noticeably less than 300 s / 10 s = 30 . Here , we take for baseline comparison a scanning frequency of 1 Hz ; hence in a 300 s simulation with our scanning method ( AECT ) , a user will perform roughly 300 / 18 . 4 ≈ 16 . 3 times fewer scans , i . e . is about 16 X more energy - eicient than a 1 Hz method , which demonstrates the energy eiciency of the proposed algorithm . Lastly , ACM Trans . Sensor Netw . AECT : Accurate Energy Eficient Contact Tracing Using Smart Phones for Infectious Disease Detection • 11 Fig . 5 . Histogram of scan counts per user over all simulations . based on our simulation results , we conclude that the accuracy of contact tracing can be signiicantly improved if the distance is used as the proximity metric as opposed to RSSI . This is to be expected since , tautologically , distance predicts the real distance better than some proxy for real distance , such as RSSI . However , we extensively explored how RSSI is inaccurate as a proxy , and the extent is signiicant . Therefore , to determine the real distance for critical applications such as contact tracing , a method such as true - range or pseudo - range multilateration must be considered , which is a part of our proposed AECT algorithm . 5 CONCLUSION In this paper , we considered the problem of contact tracing for infectious diseases such as COVID - 19 . The goal was to design an algorithm that can perform contact tracing accurately and is energy eicient . To accomplish this goal , we proposed an AECT algorithm based on the wireless scan method , which utilizes the pseudo - range multilateration technique to compute proximity . Moreover , we showed by simulations that the proposed scan method ( AECT ) is more accurate than the MS method . Furthermore , it gives comparable performance against the real distance method , which is 100 % accurate . We also demonstrated by simulations that the AECT algorithm ACM Trans . Sensor Netw . 12 • Ranjha et al . performs fewer wireless scans , and it is 16 times more energy - eicient than the baseline 1 Hz frequency method .
