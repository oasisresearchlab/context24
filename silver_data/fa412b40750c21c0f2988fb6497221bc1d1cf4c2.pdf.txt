Russell , University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center , Dallas , TX , and approved April 13 , 2017 ( received for review January 13 , 2017 ) Yellow , orange , and red coloration is a fundamental aspect of avian diversity and serves as an important signal in mate choice and aggressive interactions . This coloration is often produced through the deposition of diet - derived carotenoid pigments , yet the mechanisms of carotenoid uptake and transport are not well - understood . The white recessive breed of the common canary ( Serinus canaria ) , which carries an autosomal recessive mutation that renders its plumage pure white , provides a unique opportu - nity to investigate mechanisms of carotenoid coloration . We car - ried out detailed genomic and biochemical analyses comparing the white recessive with yellow and red breeds of canaries . Biochem - ical analysis revealed that carotenoids are absent or at very low concentrations in feathers and several tissues of white recessive canaries , consistent with a genetic defect in carotenoid uptake . Using a combination of genetic mapping approaches , we show that the white recessive allele is due to a splice donor site muta - tion in the scavenger receptor B1 ( SCARB1 ; also known as SR - B1 ) gene . This mutation results in abnormal splicing , with the most abundant transcript lacking exon 4 . Through functional assays , we further demonstrate that wild - type SCARB1 promotes cellular uptake of carotenoids but that this function is lost in the predom - inant mutant isoform in white recessive canaries . Our results in - dicate that SCARB1 is an essential mediator of the expression of carotenoid - based coloration in birds , and suggest a potential link between visual displays and lipid metabolism . coloration | carotenoids | lipid metabolism | Serinus canaria T he yellow , orange , and red coloration of the feathers , skin , and beaks of birds is most commonly produced through the deposition of carotenoid pigments ( 1 ) . Carotenoid coloration of birds has been a focus of study in the fields of behavior , evolu - tion , and physiology because it plays a key role in mate assess - ment in many species . In addition , it is frequently an indicator of individual quality , and can signal species identity ( 2 – 4 ) . Birds cannot synthesize carotenoids de novo and must acquire them through their diet ( 1 ) , potentially linking coloration to the ac - quisition of pigments from the environment ( 3 ) . Thus , key hy - potheses related to honest signaling and sexual selection have been shaped by and are currently being tested in carotenoid - ornament systems ( 5 , 6 ) . Ultimately , the information content and evolutionary trajectories of carotenoid ornaments are a function of the physiological mechanisms underlying color ex - pression , yet our understanding of these mechanisms is limited . The expression of carotenoid coloration in birds involves four distinct physiological steps : uptake in the gut , transport in cir - culatory and lymphatic systems , metabolism either at the site of deposition or in the liver , and deposition in the integument ( 7 ) . Recent progress has been made in understanding how caroten - oids are metabolized to novel forms . In 2016 , two studies in - dependently identified a key carotenoid metabolism enzyme , CYP2J19 , that mediates the oxidation of yellow carotenoids into red ketocarotenoids and is used by many bird species to produce red feathers and bare parts ( 8 , 9 ) . In other studies , expression of the carotenoid - cleaving enzyme β - carotene - 9 ′ , 10 ′ - dioxygenase ( BCO2 ) was found to be associated with loss of yellow leg col - oration in chickens ( 10 ) , and sequence variation around this same gene was associated with yellow versus white breast plumage in two sister species of wood warblers ( 4 ) . The discov - eries of the roles that CYP2J19 and BCO2 play in the carotenoid pigmentation of birds provide important insights into the meta - bolic mechanisms that underlie carotenoid coloration . Progress has also been made in understanding the mechanism whereby carotenoids are transported via the blood to target tis - sues . It has long been known that birds transport carotenoids in the circulatory and lymphatic systems via lipoproteins ( 11 , 12 ) , and recent experimental evidence confirms a key role for lipo - proteins in carotenoid transport in birds . For example , the Wisconsin hypoalpha mutant chicken has a mutation in the ABCA1 transporter , which results in markedly reduced levels of circulating high - density lipoprotein ( HDL ) and a consequent reduction in the level of carotenoids in the blood and peripheral tissues ( 13 , 14 ) . Despite these insights , many aspects of carot - enoid transport and delivery remain to be discovered . Domesticated canaries ( Serinus canaria ) provide an ideal sys - tem in which to explore the mechanisms of avian carotenoid physiology because these birds have been selectively crossed for Significance The yellow , orange , and red colors of birds are produced through the deposition of carotenoid pigments into feathers and skin , and often function as signals in aggressive interac - tions and mate choice . These colors are hypothesized to com - municate information about individual quality because their expression is linked to vital cellular processes through the mechanisms of carotenoid metabolism . To elucidate these mechanisms , we carried out genomic and biochemical analyses of the white recessive canary breed , which carries a heritable defect in carotenoid uptake . We identified a mutation in the SCARB1 gene in this breed that disrupts carotenoid transport function . Our study implicates SCARB1 as a key mediator of carotenoid - based coloration and suggests a link between ca - rotenoid coloration and lipid metabolism . Author contributions : M . B . T . , J . C .

Wild ca - naries and typical domesticated varieties pigment their feathers with yellow carotenoids ( Fig . 1 A ) ( 17 , 18 ) . The white recessive canary has entirely white plumage ( Fig . 1 B ) as well as congenital vitamin A deficiency that is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait ( 19 , 20 ) . It is hypothesized that the white recessive pheno - type is the result of a mutation affecting carotenoid uptake ( 19 , 20 ) , but the specific gene ( s ) involved remains unknown . Thus , the white recessive canary presents an opportunity to discover mechanisms of carotenoid uptake that are necessary for carot - enoid coloration in birds . Results Carotenoids Are Absent or at Very Low Concentrations in the Tissues of White Recessive Canaries . The white recessive canary is char - acterized by completely white plumage that appears to lack the yellow carotenoid pigmentation typical of wild - type canaries ( Fig . 1 A and B ) . To better understand the carotenoid physiology of the white recessive canary breed , we used high - performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) to identify and quantify caroten - oids in the feathers , skin , liver , and retina , tissues that are im - portant sites of carotenoid accumulation in birds ( 1 , 7 , 21 ) ( Fig . 1 C ) . Carotenoids were not detectable in the feathers of white recessive canaries . In contrast , feathers collected from the same tracts of typical yellow canaries contained a high concentration of carotenoids ( mean ± SE ; 128 . 89 ± 37 . 78 μ g · g − 1 feather mass ; Fig . 1 C ) , primarily canary xanthophylls ( SI Appendix , Fig . S1 A and Table S1 ) . We did not detect carotenoids in the skin of three white recessive canaries , and only trace amounts in the skin of a fourth individual ( 1 . 08 μ g · g − 1 protein ; Fig . 1 C ) . Skin from com - parable regions of typical yellow canaries contained > 100 - fold higher carotenoid concentrations ( 146 . 85 ± 66 . 84 μ g · g − 1 protein ) , primarily lutein ( SI Appendix , Fig . S1 B and Table S1 ) . The livers of both white recessive and typical yellow canaries contained low , but detectable , levels of carotenoids , with lutein being the dom - inant type . However , concentrations were significantly lower in the white recessives ( white recessive : 1 . 97 ± 0 . 66 μ g · g − 1 protein ; wild - type : 13 . 39 ± 1 . 70 μ g · g − 1 protein ; t = − 6 . 26 , df = 3 . 89 , P = 0 . 0036 ; Fig . 1 C and SI Appendix , Table S1 ) . Carotenoids were not detectable in the retinas of white recessive canaries but were present at very high concentrations in the retinas of typical yellow birds ( 622 . 57 ± 131 . 73 μ g · g − 1 protein ; Fig . 1 C and SI Appendix , Table S1 ) . Together , these results indicate that the levels of carotenoids are greatly reduced across multiple tissues in white recessive canaries . Identification of the Genomic Region Associated with White Recessive Coloration . The white recessive breed was created through fixa - tion of a spontaneous mutation by artificial selection ( 19 , 22 , 23 ) . In crosses with typical yellow canaries , this white phenotype is transmitted in a manner consistent with the existence of a single recessive allele . It is thus expected that the genomic region un - derlying white feather coloration will show elevated differentia - tion in allele frequency between white and colored canaries compared with the remainder of the genome . To search for such regions in the white recessive genome , we used whole - genome se - quencing data of pooled DNA samples ( detailed in SI Appendix , Table S2 ) . We compared white recessive canaries with other domestic breeds and one wild population , all characterized by yellow or red coloration . Because the white recessive phenotype is explained by an autosomal mutation ( 23 ) , we restricted our analysis to the autosomal chromosomes . We summarized allele frequency differentiation across the genome using the fixation index ( F ST ) and a sliding window ap - proach ( Fig . 2 A ) . Average levels of genetic differentiation be - tween white recessive canaries and the remaining populations were moderate ( F ST ∼ 0 . 15 ) . This level of genetic differentiation is conducive to identifying regions of unusually high genetic differentiation , consistent with directional selection . One region clearly stood out that contains the top nine values of the em - pirical distribution of F ST , providing a strong candidate for the sequence harboring the white recessive gene . We extended the boundaries of this region by merging all windows having F ST estimates above the 95th percentile of the empirical distribution ( F ST ≥ 0 . 23 ) , if not separated by more than five windows below this threshold . The resulting region spanned ∼ 1 . 4 Mb on scaffold NW _ 007931140 ( 11 , 350 , 000 to 12 , 790 , 000 bp ) , which is homol - ogous to zebra finch chromosome 15 ( ∼ 970 , 000 to 2 , 620 , 000 bp ) . Patterns of molecular variation do not provide direct in - formation about the underlying phenotypes . To confirm the as - sociation between our candidate region and the white recessive phenotype , we generated a backcross mapping population seg - regating for white and yellow coloration . Briefly , F1 individuals derived from a cross between white recessive and yellow parental individuals were backcrossed to white recessive individuals ( Materials and Methods ) . We found a perfect association between our candidate region and white coloration : All 24 yellow back - crossed birds were heterozygous for a SNP diagnostic between parental individuals , and all 14 white birds were homozygous . Overall , the combination of selective sweep mapping and linkage analysis allows us to conclude that our candidate region contains the gene that explains white recessive coloration in canaries . Fine Mapping Within the Candidate Region . To achieve better res - olution at the causative locus , we used identical - by - descent ( IBD ) mapping ( Fig . 2 B ) . The assumption behind this approach is that the white recessive mutation appeared once and , therefore , the causal mutation should be located within the minimum shared haplotype present in white recessive individuals . Variants were selected from the whole - genome resequencing data , and chosen randomly with respect to allele frequency differences between white recessive and other breeds . We genotyped these variants in a larger cohort of birds , including white recessive individuals ( n = 24 ) as well as individuals belonging to several breeds with red or yellow coloration ( n = 61 ) . Compared with other breeds , white recessive canaries were nearly all homozygous for a segment de - fined by multiple consecutive variants — with the exception of a single polymorphic position in a single individual that might be Yellow White recessive ( WR ) B Log10 C a r o t eno i d C on c en t r a t i on ( μ g g - 1 ) Liver Retina Skin Feather Tissue not detected in WR not detected in WR C A Fig . 1 .

Assuming that this region represents a single IBD segment , the minimum haplotype spans ∼ 321 kb between nucleotide positions 11 , 808 , 700 and 12 , 130 , 178 . An examination of the annotation of the canary reference genome ( 22 ) revealed six protein - coding genes within this chromosomal interval : NCOR2 , SCARB1 , LOC103818194 ( polyubiquitin - like ) , DHX37 , BRI3BP , and AACS ( Fig . 2 B ; further gene information is provided in SI Appendix , Table S3 ) . A Splice - Site Mutation in SCARB1 Explains the White Recessive Phenotype . We next searched within the IBD interval for po - tential causative mutations , including single - base changes , indels , and structural changes ( i . e . , inversions , duplications , translocations ) . We identified a single point mutation in this interval at nucleotide position 12 , 075 , 002 that was unique to white recessive canaries compared with the remaining pooled samples . This variant was predicted to be a mutation in the splice - donor site immediately downstream of exon 4 of the SCARB1 gene , which could potentially disrupt splicing of the transcript ( see below ) . SCARB1 is an excellent candidate gene for white recessive coloration in canaries . It encodes scavenger receptor class B , member 1 , which is known to serve as an HDL receptor and to mediate carotenoid uptake in mammals ( 24 – 28 ) . Next , we genotyped the splice variant in the cohort of sam - ples used for the IBD analysis . Consistent with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance , we found that all white recessive individuals were homozygous for the splice mutation ( “ G ” ) , whereas all yellow and red individuals across several breeds were either homozygous ( n = 60 ) or heterozygous ( n = 1 ) for the wild - type allele ( “ T ” ) . This mutation occurs in a genomic position that shows universal evolutionary conservation in whole - genome alignments across a wide diversity of bird spe - cies ( SI Appendix , Fig . S2 ) . These results suggest that the splice - site mutation detected in SCARB1 is likely to cause the white recessive phenotype . The Splice Mutation Leads to the Production of Alternative Isoforms of SCARB1 . Between exons 3 and 5 of SCARB1 , there are several potential splice donor sites that may be used as alternatives to the exon 4 splice donor mutated in white recessive canaries ( Fig . 3 A ) . To evaluate the use of these alternative splice donors , we reverse - transcribed RNA extracted from skin samples of adult white recessive and yellow canaries and PCR - amplified SCARB1 transcript across these sites ( fragment primers , Fig . 3 A ) . We then used capillary electrophoresis fragment analysis and Sanger se - quencing to characterize the amplicons and found that white re - cessive canaries lack wild - type SCARB1 but express three different splice isoforms ( Fig . 3 B and SI Appendix , Fig . S3 ) . Isoform 2 is spliced at NW _ 007931140 ( 12 , 074 , 986 to 12 , 074 , 987 bp ) , includes 15 bp of the intron , and maintains the reading frame but adds 5 amino acids between exon 4 and 5 ( Fig . 3 A and SI Appendix , Fig . S3 ) . Isoform 3 is spliced at NW _ 007931140 ( 12 , 075 , 092 to 12 , 075 , 093 bp ) within exon 4 and maintains the reading frame but omits 35 amino acids encoded by exon 4 ( Fig . 3 A and SI Appendix , Fig . S3 ) . In isoform 4 , exons 3 and 5 are spliced at their canonical donor and acceptor sites , which maintains the reading frame of the transcript but entirely skips exon 4 , omitting 68 amino acids from the protein ( Fig . 3 A and SI Ap - pendix , Fig . S3 ) . Next , we used quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) to measure the overall expression of SCARB1 and the relative expression of each splice isoform in the duodenum , liver , eye , and skin of white recessive and yellow canaries . First , we tar - geted a portion of the transcript common to all of the isoforms ( exons 7 / 8 ) and measured expression relative to a housekeeping gene , GAPDH . Overall expression of SCARB1 differed signifi - cantly among tissue types , with the highest levels of expression in the skin ( F 3 , 24 = 70 . 5 , P = 4 . 8 × 10 − 12 ; SI Appendix , Fig . S4 ) . There was a significant interaction between breed and tissue type ( F 3 , 24 = 8 . 2 , P = 0 . 0006 ; SI Appendix , Fig . S4 ) , and white recessive canaries had twofold lower levels of SCARB1 in the 0 . 25 0 . 50 10 . 00 11 . 00 12 . 00 13 . 00 F S T Mb 11 . 35 12 . 79 B NW _ 007931140 Chr15 0 . 8 1 . 0 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 0 . 0 A F S T NW _ 007931140Chr15 11 . 6 Mb 12 Mb 12 . 4 Mb 12 . 8 Mb 11 . 2 Mb NCOR2 SCARB1 AACSBRI3BP DHX37 LOC103818194 W il d T y pe W h i t e R e c e ss i v e Fig . 2 .

However , expression in the other tissue types did not differ significantly between the breeds ( Tukey ’ s post hoc test , P ≥ 0 . 083 ; SI Appendix , Fig . S4 ) . Next , we designed primers that spanned the unique splice junctions of each SCARB1 isoform ( Fig . 3 A ) and measured the expression of each isoform relative to exon 7 / 8 . In yellow canaries , we found that the wild - type isoform of SCARB1 constituted between 97 . 1 and 100 % of all transcripts derived from this gene ( Fig . 3 C ) . In contrast , in the tissues of the white recessive canaries , the wild - type isoform made up less than 9 . 3 % of all SCARB1 tran - scripts ( Fig . 3 C ) . Isoform 4 ( 50 . 3 to 93 . 1 % of all transcripts ) was most abundant in the white recessive tissues , and the remainder consisted of varying levels of the two other alternative tran - scripts ( Fig . 3 C ) . Taken together , these results indicate that the candidate splice - site mutation results in the production of al - ternative isoforms of SCARB1 , and that the predominant tran - scripts in white recessive birds exclude a large portion or the entirety of exon 4 . Absence of Exon 4 Results in a Nonfunctional Form of SCARB1 . Iso - form 4 of SCARB1 , the most abundant transcript isoform in the white recessive canary , is predicted to lack 68 amino acids , a de - ficiency that is likely to have a strong impact on SCARB1 protein function . To explore the effects of this deficiency , we aligned the amino acid sequence of canary SCARB1 to the SCARB1 proteins from representatives of four different vertebrate classes and found that 15 of the amino acids encoded by exon 4 are identical across this broad phylogenetic sample ( SI Appendix , Fig . S5 A ) . Next , we gen - erated a structural model of SCARB1 using a recently published crystal structure of a related receptor , human CD36 ( 29 ) ( SI Ap - pendix , Fig . S5 B ) . Members of the CD36 superfamily of scavenger receptors ( including SCARB1 and CD36 ) are integral membrane proteins that contain a large hydrophobic tunnel that extends through the length of the central vertical axis of the protein ( SI Appendix , Fig . S2 B ) . This tunnel is hypothesized to form a conduit for the passage of lipophilic molecules into cells ( 30 ) . In human SCARB1 , this tunnel is surrounded by extracellular subdomains that bind specific lipid carrier proteins and mediate selective uptake ( 31 – 34 ) . In the canary , portions of SCARB1 encoded by exon 4 are homologous to the ligand - binding domain identified in other mem - bers of the CD36 family ( SI Appendix , Fig . S5 C ) . Thus , the exclusion of exon 4 from SCARB1 in white recessive canaries has the potential to disrupt essential ligand binding and impair transport function . To directly test the functional consequences of the exclusion of exon 4 , we compared the activity of the wild - type isoform of SCARB1 with that of isoform 4 . We cloned the isoforms of SCARB1 into a eukaryotic expression vector that coexpresses green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) , transfected these constructs into an avian fibroblast cell line , and confirmed transfection by monitoring GFP expression . We then delivered carotenoids to these cells in two different ways . In the first experiment , to en - sure that the carotenoids were presented to the cells by the ap - propriate lipoprotein carriers ( 11 , 12 ) , we supplemented the cells with 20 % whole - chicken serum , which is rich in lipoproteins containing carotenoids ( lutein : 2 . 65 μ g · mL − 1 serum ; zeaxanthin : 1 . 40 μ g · mL − 1 serum ) . In the second experiment , we followed a previously established protocol ( 26 ) to solubilize purified zeax - anthin in cell media with a low - concentration detergent ( Tween 40 ) . We incubated the cells with these carotenoid substrates overnight , harvested the cells , and measured carotenoid uptake by HPLC . In both experiments , the expression of wild - type SCARB1 significantly enhanced the uptake of carotenoids into the cells compared with controls ( experiment 1 : F 2 , 9 = 51 . 83 , P = 1 . 2 × 10 − 5 , Tukey ’ s post hoc , P = 1 . 8 × 10 − 4 ; experiment 2 : F 2 , 5 = 24 . 69 , P = 0 . 0026 , Tukey ’ s post hoc , P = 0 . 0056 ; Fig . 4 ) . In contrast , the expression of isoform 4 of SCARB1 resulted in a small but significant reduction in the uptake of carotenoids relative to the controls ( experiment 1 : Tukey ’ s post hoc , P = 1 . 0 × 10 − 5 ; experiment 2 : Tukey ’ s post hoc , P = 0 . 0035 ; Fig . 4 ) . These results support the hypothesis that the predominant form of SCARB1 expressed in white recessive canaries is nonfunctional with respect to carotenoid transport . Discussion Through genomic and biochemical analyses of the white re - cessive canary breed , we identified a single - nucleotide sub - stitution that results in the near - total absence of carotenoid - based plumage coloration . This mutation is in a splice donor site of the gene encoding the integral membrane protein SCARB1 and results in the production of alternative transcript isoforms . Our in vitro analyses indicate that , whereas wild - type SCARB1 facilitates the cellular uptake of carotenoids , the most abundant isoform in the white recessive canary ( isoform 4 ) has lost this function . These findings implicate SCARB1 as an important A B C Fig . 3 . Splicing variants and expression levels of SCARB1 in white recessive and wild - type individuals . ( A ) SCARB1 contains alternative splice donor sites that potentially yield different transcript isoforms . To investigate these al - ternatives , we designed primers ( fragment ) to amplify across this region , yielding different amplicon sizes from each isoform ( B ) . To quantify the abundance of each alternative isoform ( C ) , we designed qPCR primers spanning each potential splice junction ( dashed lines ) . ( B ) Capillary electro - phoresis fragment analyses of amplicons across the exon 4 splice junctions , generated from skin cDNA of white recessive or yellow canaries , indicate that three alternative SCARB1 transcript isoforms are present in the skin of the white recessive canary . This multitemplate amplification is biased toward short amplicons , and therefore the intensity of the peaks does not neces - sarily reflect transcript abundance . a . u . , arbitrary units .

Our observations add to a growing body of evidence impli - cating scavenger receptors as key mediators of carotenoid uptake across a diversity of animals . SCARB1 was first characterized in humans as a high - density lipoprotein receptor that mediates the selective uptake of cholesterol , and was subsequently demon - strated to have a role in the cellular uptake of a variety of lipids , including phospholipids , products of triglycerol hydrolysis , and the lipophilic vitamins A and D ( 28 , 35 , 36 ) . SCARB1 homologs have now been implicated as mediators of carotenoid uptake in fruit flies ( Drosophila melanogaster ) , silkworms ( Bombyx mori ) , salmon ( Salmo salar ) , mice , and humans ( 24 , 26 , 37 – 41 ) . These findings suggest that SCARB1 is an ancient and conserved mechanism of carotenoid uptake in animals . Although the white recessive mutation in SCARB1 has a pro - found impact on plumage coloration and the accumulation of carotenoids in feathers , this mutation does not completely ab - rogate carotenoid uptake in all tissues . We observed very low concentrations of carotenoids in the liver and skin of some white recessive canaries , suggesting that the white recessive mutation may not completely eliminate the function of SCARB1 . It is possible that other isoforms ( i . e . , isoform 2 or 3 ) maintain some carotenoid transport function . This would not be surprising , because isoform 2 retains the entire coding sequence of SCARB1 with a small in - frame addition of five amino acids to the mature protein . Another possibility is that there exist SCARB1 - independent mechanisms of carotenoid uptake in birds . In silkworms and humans , other members of the CD36 family have been identified as mediators of carotenoid uptake , and passive diffusion is a possible mech - anism of uptake when carotenoids are present at high concen - trations ( 37 , 40 , 42 , 43 ) . These considerations notwithstanding , the dramatic phenotype of the white recessive canary indicates that SCARB1 plays a central role in carotenoid uptake in birds . The confirmation of SCARB1 as an essential mediator of carotenoid uptake in birds presents new avenues of investigation into the proximate basis of carotenoid - based color expression and the information content of these color ornaments . In mammals , SCARB1 expression and carotenoid uptake are reg - ulated by retinoid ( vitamin A ) status via the transcription factor ISX ( 44 – 46 ) . Such a mechanism is consistent with the vitamin A - redox hypothesis , which proposes that carotenoid coloration reveals information through interdependencies in the uptake , transport , and metabolism of vitamin A and carotenoids ( 7 ) . SCARB1 may also play a central role in avian reproduction . In birds , oogenesis involves the massive mobilization of cholesterol and other lipids , including carotenoids , from the body into the egg , and these lipid resources are essential for the growth and development of the embryo ( 47 ) . Thus , the broad roles of SCARB1 in avian carotenoid , retinoid , and lipid physiology potentially link the expression of carotenoid - based colors to an individual ’ s redox status , lipid physiology , and fecundity . In humans , SCARB1 is an important mediator of choles - terol homeostasis , and mutations in SCARB1 are associated with the accelerated development of coronary artery disease [ e . g . , ( 48 ) ] . The pathophysiology of the white recessive mu - tation has not been fully characterized , but further study of this canary breed could offer broad insights into the role of SCARB1 in disease . Materials and Methods Analysis of Tissue Carotenoid Content . The carotenoid content of white re - cessive and yellow canary tissues was analyzed by HPLC using methodology adapted from previous studies ( 21 ) . All experiments were conducted in accor - dance with Directive 2010 / 63 / EU on the protection of animals , and protocols were examined by the Órgão Responsável pelo Bem - Estar Animal of CIBIO . Whole - Genome Resequencing , Read Mapping , and SNP Calling . Whole - genome resequencing data from DNA pools of four canary breeds were obtained in the course of a different study ( 8 ) . Each pool was sequenced using an Illu - mina instrument to an effective coverage of ∼ 17 to 23 × ( SI Appendix , Table S1 ) . Sequencing reads were mapped to the canary reference genome as - sembly ( 49 ) using BWA - MEM ( 50 ) , and SNP calling was performed using the Bayesian haplotype - based method implemented in FreeBayes ( 51 ) . Genetic Mapping . Genetic differentiation between white recessive and other breedswassummarizedinwindowsof20kbmovedinstepsof10kbusingthe F ST as implemented in the PoPoolation2 package ( 52 ) . To confirm the association between our candidate region and the white recessive phenotype , a family consisting of 38 backcrosses segregating for the white recessive allele and wild - typeyellow coloration was used for linkage analysis . An SNPdiagnostic between parental individuals used in the cross was genotyped in all backcross individuals using Sanger sequencing IBD mapping was performed by genotyping 85 indi - viduals ( 24 white recessive and 61 from other breeds ) for 38 SNPs within and flanking the candidate region using Sequenom ’ s iPLEX technology . Search for Causative Mutations . SNP and indel variants within the candidate regionwerefunctionallyannotatedusingthegeneticvariantannotationand effect prediction toolbox SnpEff ( 53 ) . The identification of structural variants was performed using three approaches : BreakDancer ( 54 ) , DELLY ( 55 ) , and LUMPY ( 56 ) . The splice - site mutation was genotyped using Sanger se - quencing for the same 85 individuals used for IBD . Whole - Genome Alignment of Bird Species . To evaluate conservation of the candidate causative mutation in SCARB1 across the avian phylogeny , we obtained whole - genome alignments of available avian genomes using LASTZ ( 57 ) , chainNet ( 58 ) , and MULTIZ ( 59 ) . Analysis of SCARB1 Transcript Isoform Expression . To identify alternative splice isoforms , we PCR - amplified from exons 3 to 5 of the SCARB1 transcript from cDNA derived from the skin of wild - type and white recessive canaries , and examined the amplicons by capillary electrophoresis fragment analysis and Sanger sequencing . We measured the relative expression of the SCARB1 tran - script isoforms in white recessive and yellow canaries by qPCR with primers that targeted the splice junctions unique to each isoform . RNA extraction , cDNA production , and qPCR analyses were carried out as described previously ( 8 ) . Functional Analysis of SCARB1 Variants . The wild - type and isoform 4 of SCARB1 were cloned from canary cDNA ( above ) into eukaryotic expression vectors and expressed in DF1 cells . These cells were cultured overnight in carotenoid - enriched media , and cellular carotenoid uptake was analyzed by HPLC . All methods and materials are further detailed in SI Appendix , Ma - terials and Methods . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS . We thank the multiple breeders who contributed samples for this project .
