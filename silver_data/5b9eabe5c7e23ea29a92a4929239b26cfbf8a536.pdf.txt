Received 3 November 2010 ; accepted 4 April 2011 ; published online 13 April 2011 ; doi : 10 . 1038 / nbt . 1862 The human orthologs of the ESCC miRNAs are also highly expressed in ESCs , are downregulated upon differentiation and regulate the cell cycle 2 , 9 – 12 . These miRNAs include members of the human miR - 302 cluster ( hsa - miR - 302a – d ) , orthologous to the mouse miR - 302s , and hsa - miR - 372 and 373 , orthologous to the mouse miR - 291 , miR - 294 and miR - 295 miRNAs . To determine whether these miRNAs play an analogous role in human somatic cell reprogramming , we introduced synthesized mimics of mature hsa - miR - 302b and / or 372 into human foreskin ( BJ ) and lung fibroblasts ( MRC - 5 ) on days 3 and 10 after infection with combinations of retroviruses expressing OCT4 , SOX2 , KLF4 , cMYC and Venus ( 4Y = OCT4 , SOX2 , KLF4 , cMYC and Venus , whereas 3Y = OCT4 , Sox2 , KLF4 and Venus ) . An increase in number of colonies with human ESC - like morphology was observed in all wells transfected with mimics ( Fig . 1a ) . Most of the colonies showed retroviral silencing ( as indicated by silencing of Venus expression ) , a strong indicator of full reprogramming to iPSCs 13 . Representative BJ iPSC colonies were expanded and molecularly characterized . Reverse transcriptase – quantitative PCR ( RT - qPCR ) analysis of gene expression confirmed silencing of the exogenous fac - tors ( Fig . 1b ) , as well as endogenous expression of pluripotency mark - ers , such as OCT3 / 4 , SOX2 , NANOG and DNMT3B , similar to that of H9 human embryonic stem cells ( hESCs ) ( Fig . 1c ) . The colonies also showed immunostaining for pluripotency markers including OCT3 / 4 and TRA - 1 - 60 ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . Together , these characteristics are indicative of a fully reprogrammed state 14 . Thus , the introduction of ESCC miRNAs along with the reprogramming factors enhanced the reprogramming of the human cells into pluripotent stem cell colonies , similar to what was previously described for mouse cells 1 . MiRNAs regulate their targets by incomplete complementation to nucleotides within the 3 ′ untranslated region ( UTR ) or open read - ing frame ( ORF ) of coding mRNAs 15 . Of particular importance is base pairing between a specific portion of the miRNA called the seed sequence ( bases 2 through 8 ) with a complementary sequence in the transcript 7 . Introduction of mimics with seed sequence mutations together with either 3Y or 4Y resulted in abrogation of the miRNA - induced enhancement of colony formation ( Fig . 1a ) , confirming the The embryonic stem cell – specific cell cycle – regulating ( ESCC ) family of microRNAs ( miRNAs ) enhances reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells 1 . Here we show that the human ESCC miRNA orthologs hsa - miR - 302b and hsa - miR - 372 promote human somatic cell reprogramming . Furthermore , these miRNAs repress multiple target genes , with downregulation of individual targets only partially recapitulating the total miRNA effects . These targets regulate various cellular processes , including cell cycle , epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , epigenetic regulation and vesicular transport . ESCC miRNAs have a known role in regulating the unique embryonic stem cell cycle 2 , 3 . We show that they also increase the kinetics of mesenchymal - epithelial transition during reprogramming and block TGF β - induced EMT of human epithelial cells . These results demonstrate that the ESCC miRNAs promote dedifferentiation by acting on multiple downstream pathways . We propose that individual miRNAs generally act through numerous pathways that synergize to regulate and enforce cell fate decisions . Dedifferentiation of a somatic cell to an induced pluripotent stem cell ( iPSC ) requires global epigenetic reprogramming and a shift in the expression of thousands of genes 4 . A number of small molecules and genes have been identified that increase the efficiency of reprogramming , but whether and how they converge into a common set of pathways is poorly understood 5 , 6 . MiRNAs function by suppressing many mRNA targets simultaneously 7 . A large family of miRNAs highly expressed in mouse embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) targets multiple inhibitors of the CyclinE - Cdk2 pathway , thereby promoting the unique cell cycle program of these cells 3 . This family , termed ESCC miRNAs , greatly enhances the reprogramming efficiency of mouse embryonic fibroblasts into iPSCs , as does the closely related miR - 106 family 1 , 8 . Together , these data suggest a pathway for downregulation of cell cycle inhibitors by the ESCC miRNAs during reprogramming , resulting in increased efficiency of dedifferentia - tion . However , as miRNAs target hundreds of mRNAs , it is likely that cell cycle regulation is only part of the mechanism .

A ll r i gh t s r ese r v e d . 444 volume 29 number 5 may 2011 nature biotechnology have been shown to enhance reprogramming to mouse and human iPSCs 20 – 22 . Consistent with these reports , we observed an increase in reprogramming efficiency with both 4Y and 3Y upon addition of RepSox , a T β RI inhibitor ( Fig . 2b , c ) . Furthermore , expression of the type II TGF - β receptor cDNA ( T β RII ) without its 3 ′ UTR or addition of TGF - β ligand abolished iPSC generation ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) , over - riding the positive effects of miR - 302b and miR - 372 . For the remain - ing 11 significantly downregulated target genes , siRNA pools against each target were transfected together with transduction of 4Y or 3Y . All siRNA pools robustly suppressed their target gene ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Five of the 11 knockdowns significantly increased the number of iPSC colony numbers in combination with 4Y , and four did so with 3Y , totaling six independent gene knockdowns enhancing reprogramming ( Fig . 2b , c ) . However , the increases were modest , with few reaching levels seen with miR - 372 . As downregulation of RHOC expression sig - nificantly enhanced the reprogramming efficiencies of both 4Y and 3Y , we tested an alternative means of repressing RHO functions . Y - 27632 ( ROCKi ) is a small - molecule inhibitor of the RHO - dependent protein kinase ROCK , which acts immediately downstream of RHO 23 . ROCKi enhances survival of dissociated hESCs 24 – 26 but has not been previously shown to enhance reprogramming . We found that the combination of ROCKi together with 4Y or 3Y indeed increased colony number ( Fig . 2b , c ) . As inhibition of RHOC and T β RI signaling enhanced reprogram - ming , we explored whether these two pathways synergized to regulate this process by conducting 3Y and 4Y reprogramming in the presence of ROCKi , RepSox or both molecules . Indeed , various combinations of ROCKi , RepSox and miR - 372 also resulted in a significant increase in colony number compared to mock - transfected cells ( Fig . 2b , c ) . The increase in efficiency observed upon using combinations of inhibitors in 3Y - infected cells was significantly higher than when a single inhibi - tor was used and reached levels seen with miR - 372 ( Fig . 2c ) . Together , these results are consistent with the ESCC miRNAs acting through multiple targets and / or pathways to enhance reprogramming . essential role of seed sequence – based targeting in the enhancement of reprogramming . We sought to identify the genes and mechanisms by which miR - 302b and miR - 372 enhance human iPSC production . Previous mRNA pro - filing after introduction of the miRNAs into miRNA - deficient mouse ESCs , together with bioinformatic analysis for seed matches in the mRNAs , had identified a set of putative miR - 294 target genes 16 . As miR - 302b and 372 share the same seed sequence as miR - 294 , this com - pilation likely represents a set of putative targets for the entire ESCC miRNA family . From this list , we chose a subset of target genes for further testing to determine whether they were targeted during the reprogramming process ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Transcript levels of 34 putative targets were quantified by RT - qPCR on day 7 of 4Y - or 3Y - mediated reprogramming in the presence or absence of the miR - NAs ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Among these , 12 transcripts ( labeled in red ) showed statistically significant decreases in levels after transfection of the miRNA in cells that had been infected with either 4Y or 3Y ( P < 0 . 05 ) . An additional 15 transcripts were downregulated at levels that did not reach our significance cut - off but are still probably meaningful as cells undergoing reprogramming are heterogeneous and miRNA effects on mRNA stability are typically slight . Notably , after miRNA transfection into uninfected BJ fibroblasts only a few of the putative targets were downregulated , suggesting context - dependent effects . The 12 target genes that were significantly downregulated dur - ing reprogramming were further characterized . The mRNAs fell into several functional modules : ( i ) cell cycle regulation ( CDKN1A , RBL2 , CDC2L6 ) ; ( ii ) epigenetic regulation ( MECP2 , MBD2 , SMARCC2 ) ; ( iii ) vesicular transport ( RAB5C , RAB11FIP5 ) ; ( iv ) cell signaling ( AKT1 , ARHGAP26 ) ; and ( v ) epithelial - mesenchymal transition ( RHOC , TGFBR2 ) . Of these , CDKN1A , RBL2 and MECP2 have been previously described as targets of miR - 302b / 372 ( refs . 2 , 3 , 17 – 19 ) . Next , we evaluated the potential contribution to reprogramming of the individual target genes that are significantly downregulated by the miRNAs .

A ll r i gh t s r ese r v e d . nature biotechnology volume 29 number 5 may 2011 445 the miRNAs only in the context of reprogramming and SLUG showed a decrease with miR - 372 during reprogramming . The transcription factors ZEB1 , ZEB2 and SLUG are not only markers of the mesenchy - mal fate but also directly inhibit the epithelial fate in part by inhibiting the expression of E - cadherin 31 . Indeed , E - cadherin ( CDH1 ) expression and , to a lesser extent , the expression of the epithelial markers , occludin ( OCLN ) and EP - CAM , were upregulated at day 7 of reprogramming with the addition of miRNAs ( Fig . 3c and Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . In contrast , the introduction of miRNAs alone into uninfected fibroblasts was unable to induce expression of the epithelial markers ( Fig . 3c and Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . To more closely follow the kinetics of MET with and without the introduction of the miRNAs , we examined the appearance of epithelial markers by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry at different To verify that the ESCC miRNAs enhance reprogramming through multiple transcripts , we evaluated the two novel targets , RHOC and TGFBR2 . Consistent with the RT - qPCR data , western blots showed that the level of T β RII protein was suppressed by miR - 302b and miR - 372 during reprogramming ( Fig . 3a ) . TGFBR2 mRNA has three 7 - mer seed matches and three 6 - mer seed matches in its 3 ′ UTR ( Fig . 3b , sche - matic ) . The 3 ′ UTR was fused to a luciferase reporter and introduced into miRNA - deficient mouse ESCs in the presence and absence of the miRNA mimics . Luciferase activity was significantly reduced in the presence of the ESCC miRNAs ( Fig . 3b , top panel ) but not when muta - tions were introduced into the seed sequence of the mimics ( Fig . 3b , middle panel ) . Furthermore , mutation of the 7 - mer seed matches in the TGFBR2 mRNA 3 ′ UTR resulted in a significant recovery of luciferase activity ( Fig . 3b , top panel , and Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Incomplete recovery is likely due to the existence of additional target sites in the TGFBR2 3 ′ UTR ( Fig . 3b ) . In contrast to the TGFBR2 mRNA , RHOC mRNA has only one 7 - mer seed match in its 3 ′ UTR ( Fig . 3b , schematic ) . The 3 ′ UTR still suppressed luciferase activity , albeit to a lesser degree , and was fully reversed by insert - ing mutations into the predicted site ( Fig . 3b , bottom panel ) . Together , these data illustrate that the genes encoding RHOC and TGFBR2 are direct targets of the ESCC miRNAs . miR - 302 was previously shown to enhance Nodal signaling , another member of the TGF - β fam - ily , by targeting Lefty1 and Lefty2 transcripts during early hESC differentiation , promot - ing mesoendodermal cell fates 27 . However , the genes encoding Lefty1 and Lefty2 were expressed at low levels during reprogramming to iPSCs and were not downregulated by the ESCC miRNAs ( data not shown ) , suggesting cell context – specific effects . The finding that miR - 302b and miR - 372 inhibited TGFBR2 and RHOC expression , and to a lesser extent , the expression of SMAD2 , INHBB , GAPs and GEFs ( Fig . 2a ) is intrigu - ing as these signaling mediators regulate the choice between epithelial and mesenchy - mal cell fates 28 . Recent work has shown that mouse fibroblasts undergo a mesenchymal - epithelial transition ( MET ) early in the pro - cess of reprogramming 29 , 30 . Therefore , we hypothesized that miR - 302b and miR - 372 may increase reprogramming efficiency by accelerating MET . To test this hypothesis , we followed marker expression during repro - gramming with or without the addition of miR - 302b and miR - 372 . RT - qPCR was per - formed on RNA isolated 7 d after transduction ( 4 d after transfection of miRNAs ) of human fibroblasts . The addition of miR - 302b and / or miR - 372 decreased the levels of the mes - enchymal markers ZEB1 and FN1 , indepen - dent of the introduction of reprogramming factors , and consistent with the presence of seed matches in their ORF or 3 ′ UTR ( Fig . 3c , Supplementary Fig . 6 and Supplementary Table 1 ) .

Similar enhancement in E - cadherin levels was also observed upon treatment of cells with either ROCKi ( Supplementary Fig . 7b ) or RepSox ( Supplementary Fig . 7c ) . Immunocytochemistry was performed to detect the expression of the epithelial markers JAM - 1 and E - cadherin ( Fig . 3d ) , and the organiza - tion of F - actin , whose distribution changes dramatically during MET ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . Cells transduced with 4Y alone began expressing JAM - 1 at day 8 and E - cadherin at day 15 after infection . When supplemented with miR - 372 , the expression of JAM - 1 and E - cadherin was accelerated to days 5 and 8 , respectively . Similar to 4Y infection of cells , miR - 372 accelerated the initiation of JAM - 1 expression from day 15 to day 10 in 3Y - infected cells . E - cadherin expression was not detected in this time course with 3Y - infected cells but was robust at day 18 with the addition of miR - 372 ( Fig . 3d ) . These changes coin - cided with the relocalization of F - actin in the cells . That is , the actin filaments acquired a cortical organization during dedifferentia - tion , which occurred earlier in 3Y with addi - tion of the miRNAs ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . Importantly , the appearance of E - cadherin expression coincided with the emergence of completely reprogrammed colonies in the presence of the miRNAs ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . Together , these results support a role for the occurrence of MET during the course of reprogramming of human cells , similar to what was described for mouse cells 29 , 30 , and illustrate that the ESCC miRNAs increase the efficiency of reprogramming in part by induc - ing more efficient MET . We next investigated whether these miRNAs are general stabilizers of the epithelial cell fate . TGF - β can induce an EMT in epithelial cells 28 . We therefore asked whether miR - 302b and miR - 372 could inhibit TGF - β – induced EMT in human keratinocyte HaCaT cells . HaCaT cells were treated with TGF - β 2 d after trans - fection with miRNA mimics . miR - 302b / 372 decreased T β RII levels without affecting T β RI levels in HaCaT cells ( Fig . 4a ) . Moreover , the ESCC miRNAs inhibited TGF - β – induced SMAD2 and SMAD3 phosphorylation in response to TGF - β , compared to control untreated cells ( Fig . 4a ) . Without TGF - β treatment , the expression of miR - 302b / 372 did not affect the epithelial morphology of HaCaT cells , as observed by phase contrast micros - copy ( Fig . 4b ) , cortical actin organization and the presence of E - cadherin and ZO - 1 at cell - cell junctions ( Fig . 4c ) . After 72 h of TGF - β treatment , HaCaT cells underwent EMT with dramatic morphological changes accompa - nied by cell individualization ( Fig . 4b ) , actin reorganization into stress fibers , and loss of E - cadherin and ZO - 1 expression ( Fig . 4c ) . In time points during reprogramming . Immunoblotting clearly showed earlier and stronger expression of E - cadherin in the presence of miR - 372 ( Supplementary Fig . 7a ) . At day 10 , E - cadherin was robustly expressed in 4Y - infected cells plus miR - 372 but barely visible in 4Y alone or 3Y plus miR - 372 . At day 18 , E - cadherin expression was higher in 4Y cells plus JAM - 1 DAPI JAM - 1 DAPI E - CadDAPI E - CadDAPI 4Y 4Y + miR - 372 3Y 3Y + miR - 372 d5 d8 d10 d12 d15 d18 d5 d8 d10 d12 d15 d18 CDH1 0 0 . 01 0 . 03 0 . 05 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 0 . 002 0 . 004 0 . 04 0 . 06 0 . 08 0 0 . 02 0 . 04 0 . 06 0 . 08 0 . 1 ZEB1 0 0 . 05 0 . 1 0 . 15 0 . 2 0 . 25 0 . 3 SLUG 4 Y + m o ck 4 Y + m i R - 302b 4 Y + m i R - 372 4 Y + m i R - 302b + m i R - 372 3 Y + m o ck 3 Y + m i R - 302b 3 Y + m i R - 372 3 Y + m i R - 302b + m i R - 372 B J + m i R - 302b B J + m i R - 372 E x p r e ss i on no r m a li z ed t o G AP DH OCLN B J + m o ck B J + m i R - 302b + m i R - 372 H 9 4 Y + m o ck 4 Y + m i R - 302b 4 Y + m i R - 372 4 Y + m i R - 302b + m i R - 372 3 Y + m o ck 3 Y + m i R - 302b 3 Y + m i R - 372 3 Y + m i R - 302b + m i R - 372 B J + m i R - 302b B J + m i R - 372 B J + m o ck B J + m i R - 302b + m i R - 372 H 9 M o ck m i R - 302b m i R - 302b m u t . m i R - 372 m i R - 372 m u t .

Accordingly , these miRNAs are expected to enhance reprogramming through their effects on the cell cycle . Indeed , knockdown of p21 during reprogramming has been shown to enhance induced pluripotency 33 – 36 . Here we show that RBL2 knockdown also enhances reprogramming . However , because the ESCC miRNAs have hundreds of target genes 16 , we tested a larger subset of these targets in reprogramming . We show that , in addition to their effects on cell cycle regulators , these miRNAs also target genes involved in epige - netic regulation , vesicular transport and MET during reprogramming , and that downregulation of many of these target genes increases the number of iPSC colonies produced . Follow - up experiments confirmed that the ESCC miRNAs function in part through MET by targeting at least TGFBR2 and RHOC , but also likely SMAD2 , ZEB1 and FN1 to enhance reprogramming . Future experiments are likely to confirm the role of additional pathways downstream of these miRNAs . Indeed , our contrast , expression of miR - 302b and miR - 372 substantially inhibited TGF - β – induced EMT in HaCaT cells . The cells failed to spread and maintained their cell - cell contacts resembling an epithelial phenotype ( Fig . 4b ) . In addi - tion , E - cadherin and ZO - 1 remained local - ized at the cell - cell junctions , as revealed by immunofluorescence ( Fig . 4c ) . Confirming these observations , E - cadherin expression was higher in miR - 302b / 372 - transfected cells compared to control cells after 48 h of TGF - β treatment ( Fig . 4d ) . The expression of the transcriptional repressor SLUG is normally upregulated in TGF - β – induced EMT , repress - ing CDH1 transcription 28 . Its expression was reduced in HaCaT cells transfected with miR - 302b / 372 , compared to control cells after 24 h of TGF - β treatment ( Fig . 4e ) . Notably , each of these effects on EMT was completely abrogated when the seed sequence was mutated in the mimics ( Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . These results demonstrate that miR - 302b and miR - 372 are potent inhibitors of TGF - β – induced EMT as well as promoters of MET during reprogramming . To determine whether these effects were conserved among the ESCC miRNAs , we included the mimic for the mouse ESCC homolog mmu - miR - 294 , which contains the same seed sequence as hsa - miR - 302b / 372 ( Fig . 4a ) . The mmu - miR - 294 mimic yielded similar results to those of the human ESCC miRNAs , and these effects were abrogated by dis - rupting the seed sequence , indicating a highly conserved and seed - dependent role of ESCC miRNAs in regulating EMT . Taken together , our findings show that the ESCC miRNAs enhance the efficiency of reprogramming to induced pluripotency by target - ing multiple mRNAs enriched in various important cellular processes . Others have suggested that miR - 302a - d alone can promote dediffer - entiation of cancer cells and human hair follicle cells to an iPSC - like state 18 , 32 .

Human foreskin fibroblasts ( BJ ) and fetal lung fibroblasts ( MRC - 5 ) were cultured in DMEM and 10 % FBS supplemented with nonessential amino acids , l - glutamine , penicillin / streptomycin and beta - mercaptoethanol ( BJ medium ) . We plated 15 , 000 cells on 0 . 2 % gelatin in 12 - well plates . The follow - ing day , cells were infected with amphotropic retroviruses encoding OCT3 / 4 , SOX2 , KLF4 , cMYC and Venus ( gift from K . Eggan and packaged by Harvard Gene Therapy Initiative ) . cMYC retrovirus was added at one - tenth the concen - tration of the other viruses . Infections were done in 0 . 5 ml human ESC medium ( knockout DMEM containing 15 % knockout serum replacement ; 10 ng / ml bFGF and supplemented with nonessential amino acids , l - glutamine and beta - mercaptoethanol ) . The following day , 0 . 5 ml BJ medium was added to the wells and the medium was changed completely to human ES medium 24 h later . Cells were transfected with miRNA mimics at a final concentration of 50 nM using Dharmafect1 ( ThermoFisher ) following manufacturer’s protocol on days 3 and 10 . All mimics were purchased from ThermoFisher . Medium was changed every 24 h and colonies with human ESC - like morphology were counted at 21 d ( in the case of reprogramming using 4Y ) or at 31 d ( for 3Y reprogramming ) . Colonies were also examined for prevalence of Venus fluorescence , which was used as a marker for silencing of exogenous factors . For picking and expansion , colonies were picked onto irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts and were passaged manually , until stable lines were obtained . ROCK inhibitor ( 10 µ M final con - centration , Y - 27632 from EMD Biosciences ) or TGF - β 1 ( 2 ng / ml ) was added to cells starting on day 3 after infection ; the T β RI inhibitor ( 25 µ M final concentra - tion , RepSox from Sigma ) was added to cells from days 6 – 10 after infection . For overexpression of T β RII , the ORF was cloned downstream of the EF1 α promoter in pSin - IRES - Pac ( puromycin resistance ) 3 , packaged into lentiviruses followed by infection of fibroblasts on day 3 . haCaT cell culture and EMT . HaCaT cells were cultured in DMEM with glu - cose ( 4 . 5 g / l ) and 10 % FBS . Cells were plated at 100 , 000 cells per well of a 6 - well plate and transfected the next day with miRNA mimics ( ThermoFisher ) using Dharmafect 1 ( ThermoFisher ) according to manufacturer’s protocol . Mimics were transfected at a final concentration of 40 nM . On day 2 after transfection , cells were analyzed as follows . For signaling pathway protein quantification , cells were starved of serum with 0 . 5 % FBS overnight , treated with 2 ng / ml of TGF - β 1 ( HumanZyme ) for indicated times and lysed . For RNA quantification , cells were split , then treated with TGF - β 1 for 24 h and lysed . For morphological and immu - nocytochemical analysis of EMT , cells were split into chamber slides , and treated with TGF - β 1 for 72 h before fixing and imaging . To view the cell morphology or to monitor TGF - β – induced EMT , cells were observed using a Leica DMI 4000B microscope , and brightfield pictures were taken using a Leica DFC 350FX camera . Images were analyzed using the Leica Application Suite and Photoshop ( Adobe ) software . The T β RI kinase inhibitor SB431542 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was used at 5 µ M in conditions without TGF - β treatment to inhibit secreted autocrine TGF - β . immunocytochemistry . For hiPSC and hESC , cells were fixed with 4 % para - formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature , followed by blocking and per - meabilization using 5 % BSA in PBS containing 0 . 2 % Tween 20 for 1 - 2 h . Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with Rhodamine - Phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) ; E - Cadherin ( BD - Transduction Laboratories ) and JAM - 1 antibodies ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) and were stained with rhodamine - conjugated secondary antibod - ies . Cells were imaged using an inverted Leica fluorescent microscope . HaCaT cells were fixed with 4 % PFA for 30 min , permeabilized in 2 % PFA and 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 for 10 min , and incubated in PBS and 3 % BSA blocking solution for 1 h . The slides were incubated for 2 h with E - cadherin ( BD Biosciences ) and ZO - 1 ( Invitrogen ) antibodies in PBS and 3 % BSA , and were stained for 1 h with AlexaFluor - conjugated secondary antibodies and rhodamine - conjugated phalloi - din ( Invitrogen ) to visualize actin filaments . The slides were then mounted using ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI ( Invitrogen ) . Images were viewed by epifluorescence imaging and acquired using a Nikon T i inverted microscope with 60 × / 1 . 49 Apo TIRF objectives and Coolsnap HQ 2 camera ( Photometrics ) controlled by NIS Elements software ( Nikon ) . RNA extraction and qPCR . RNA for most qRT - PCR analysis was prepared using Trizol ( Invitrogen ) , following the manufacturer’s protocol and quantified on a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer ( ThermoFisher ) . We treated 500 ng of RNA with DNase using DNaseI amplification grade ( Invitrogen ) . For qRT - PCR of mRNAs , DNase - treated samples were reverse transcribed using the Superscript III first - strand synthesis system for RT - PCR ( Invitrogen ) . qPCR reactions on resulting cDNAs were performed using Power SYBR Green Master Mix ( Applied Biosystems ) on either an ABI Prism 7100 or ABI 7900HT ( Applied Biosystems ) and data was normalized to GAPDH expression . For HaCaT cells , RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit ( Qiagen ) , following the manufac - turer’s instructions . The iScript cDNA synthesis kit ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) was used to generate cDNA for real - time PCR of Slug and RPL19 for normalization using iQ SYBR Green supermix ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) , following the manufac - turer’s instructions on the CFX96 Real - Time PCR detection system ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) . CFX Manager software ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) was used for the quantification . PCR primers are listed in Supplementary Table 2 . Western blotting . For protein quantification during reprogramming , cells were lysed on days 10 and 18 after infection in lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 120 mM NaCl , 0 . 5 % NP - 40 , supplemented with a commercially available mix of protease and phosphatase inhibitors ) . Protein lysates were separated on a 10 % SDS - PAGE and were blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride ( PVDF ) membrane using the Bio - Rad electrophoresis unit . Blots were blocked using LI - COR blocking buffer for 1 – 2 h followed by incubation with the primary and secondary antibodies diluted at the appropriate concentrations in the blocking buffer . Blots were imaged using the LI - COR Odyssey scanner . Quantification of blots was performed using the LI - COR imaging software . Anti - E - cadherin ( BD - Transduction Laboratories ) was used at a concentration of 1 : 1 , 000 , and anti - beta - actin ( Sigma , A4700 ) was used at 1 : 10 , 000 . For protein quantification of TGF - β signaling proteins in HaCaTs , cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation ( RIPA ) buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors at noted time points after exposure to ligand . Protein concentration was determined using protein assay ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) , and 10 to 20 µ g of proteins was separated by SDS - PAGE and transferred to 0 . 2 mm nitrocellulose membrane . Membranes were blocked in TBS , 0 . 1 % Tween 20 and 5 % dry milk for 1 h before overnight incubation with primary antibody diluted in TBS , 0 . 1 % Tween 20 and 3 % BSA . Antibodies used were specific for T β RI , T β RII , GAPDH ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) , phospho - Smad2 , phospho - Smad3 , Smad2 , Smad3 or E - cadherin ( Cell Signaling Technology ) . The membranes were incubated with HRP - conjugated secondary antibody ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories ) diluted in TBS , 0 . 1 % Tween 20 . Immunoreactive proteins were detected using ECL ( GE Healthcare ) and BioMax film ( Kodak ) . Luciferase reporter assays . The 3 ′ UTRs of TGFBR2 and RhoC were ampli - fied from the genomic DNA of human foreskin ( BJ ) fibroblast cells using the TOPO ( Invitrogen ) vector and subcloned into the NotI and XhoI restriction sites of the psiCheck - 2 vector ( Promega ) . Mutant variants of the 3 ′ UTR seed sequences were produced using the Quickchange XL kit ( Agilent ) . For transfec - tion , 8 , 000 miRNA - deficient Dgcr8 − / − mouse ESCs were plated in ESC media onto a 96 - well plate pretreated with 0 . 2 % gelatin . The subsequent day , the cells were transfected with miRIDIAN miRNA mimics ( Dharmacon , ThermoFisher ) with Dharmafect1 ( Dharmacon , ThermoFisher ) at the manufacturer’s recom - mended concentration of 100 nM . Simultaneously , 200 ng of the psiCheck - 2 constructs were transfected into the ESCs using Fugene6 ( Roche ) transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Transfection of each con - struct was performed in duplicate in each assay . The cells were lysed 18 – 20 h after transfection , and the luciferase assay was performed using the Dual - Luciferase Reporter Assay System ( Promega ) on a dual - injecting SpectraMax L ( Molecular Devices ) luminometer according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Ratios of Renilla luciferase readings to firefly luciferase readings were aver - aged for each experiment . Replicates performed on separate days were median centered with the readings from the individual days . © 201 1 N a t u r e A m e r i c a , I n c . A ll r i gh t s r ese r v e d .
