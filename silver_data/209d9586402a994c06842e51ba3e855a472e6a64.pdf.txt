APC - Mediated Proteolysis during the Cell Cycle Temporal pattern of APC Cdc20 and APC Cdh1 ac - tivities ( A ) and of the destruction of some of their substrates ( B ) during the cell cycle of somatic animal cells . APC Cdc20 is activated at the onset of prometaphase ( PM ) when it initi - ates the degradation of cyclin A ( CycA ) and Nek2A . Proteolysis of cyclin B ( CycB ) and securin ( Sec ) also depends on APC Cdc20 but is delayed until metaphase ( M ) by the spindle assembly checkpoint . During anaphase ( A ) and telophase ( T ) , APC Cdh1 is activated and mediates the destruction of additional sub - strates such as Plk1 and Cdc20 .

( 2 ) APC Cdc20 also helps to activate separase by initiating the degradation of cyclin B and other mitotic cyclins .

In early Xenopus em - bryos , Xkid proteolysis may therefore be required to ( Kitamura et al . , 1998 ; Kominami et al . , 1998 ) . The same effect is seen , both in fission and budding yeast , if APC inactivate polar ejection forces which might otherwise prevent chromatid segregation in anaphase ( Figure 2 ) . subunits are inactivated during G1 ( Irniger and Nasmyth , 1997 ; Kumada et al . , 1995 ) .

However , the microtubule associated protein Ase1 and the kinesins Kip1 and Cin8 and mutation of cyclin genes suppresses the G1 arrest deficiency of APC Cdh1 mutants in G1 ( Kitamura et al . , have also been identified as APC substrates in budding yeast , suggesting that APC - dependent proteolysis is 1998 ; Kominami et al . , 1998 ) . These observations sug - gest that in the presence of mating factors or under more widely used to control spindle function ( Gordon and Roof , 2001 ; Hildebrandt and Hoyt , 2001 ; Juang et starvation conditions APC Cdh1 is required to prevent cyclin accumulation and the activation of S phase pro - al . , 1997 ) .

Taken together , the ob - servations made in yeast , Drosophila embryos , and cul - signaling is activated . Furthermore , overexpression of SnoN can decrease TGF (cid:2) signaling , suggesting that tured chicken cells imply that APC Cdh1 is not absolutely essential for the establishment of G1 phases but that it SnoN destruction is required for full activation of TGF (cid:2) signaling .

These obser - vations suggest that during G1 and G0 , APC Cdh1 helps to where it can be detected in the nuclei of differentiated neurons ( Gieffers et al . , 1999 ) .

First experiments suggest that Emi1 can bind to Cdc20 and prevent its interaction with APC substrates but not the binding of Cdc20 to the APC ( Reimann et al . , 2001b ) . Emi1 itself is degraded early in mitosis in an APC - independent manner , consistent with its destruc - tion being required for APC Cdc20 activation ( Reimann et al . , 2001a ) . In Drosophila , a homolog of Emi1 , called Rca1 , has an important role in keeping APC Cdh1 inactive during G2 ( see below ) , but surprisingly there is no evi - dence yet that Rca1 also regulates APC Cdc20 . It is there - fore possible that mitotic APC phosphorylation and Emi1 / Rca1 destruction are of different importance for APC Cdc20 activation in different species or cell types or that additional mechanisms of APC Cdc20 regulation still remain to be discovered .

The identification of in vivo phosphorylation Mad2 can either bind to the checkpoint protein Mad1 sites and mutational analyses will therefore be required or to Cdc20 but not simultaneously to both ( Hwang et to clarify if and how phosphorylation regulates APC Cdc20 al . , 1998 ; Sironi et al . , 2001 ) .

These observations suggest that unattached kinetochores recruit Mad1 which then can bind Mad2 and convert it into a form that can interact with Cdc20 . How Mad2 - Cdc20 complexes then inhibit the APC is not known . In vitro Mad2 can inhibit the association of Cdc20 with the APC ( Reimann et al . , 2001b ; Tang et al . , 2001a ) , suggesting that Mad2 could inhibit APC by titrating out Cdc20 . However , it is unclear if a single unattachedkinetochore , whichissufficientto delayana - phase , could inactivate enough Cdc20 to prevent cyclin B and securin destruction . It is easier to envision that Mad2 - Cdc20 complexes inhibit APC function in a domi - nant manner . Consistent with this hypothesis , Mad2 can indeed be specifically detected in mitotic APC immuno - precipitates ( Kallio et al . , 1998 ; Wassmann and Benezra , 1998 ) . Mad2 can also slow down the dissociation of Cdc20 - substrate complexes in vitro ( Pfleger et al . , 2001b ) , raising the possibility that Mad2 interferes with some step during substrate ubiquitination . Recent biochemical fractionation experiments showed Figure 4 . Regulation of APC Cdh1 that only a complex containing Mad2 , Cdc20 , BubR1 , Cdh1 is phosphorylated during S , G2 , and mitosis by S phase and and Bub3 is able to efficiently inhibit APC Cdc20 in vitro , mitoticCDKssuchasCdk2andCdk1 , respectively . Cdh1phosphor - whereas fractions that contain Mad2 molecules which ylation prevents the association of Cdh1 with the APC , but it does are not part of this mitotic checkpoint complex ( MCC ) not inhibit the association of Cdh1 with APC substrates ( Schwab et have no inhibitory effect ( Sudakin et al . , 2001 ) . Experi - al . , 2001 ) . Cdh1 is dephosphorylated at the end of mitosis , resulting in APC Cdh1 activation . In budding yeast , Cdh1 dephosphorylation is ments with recombinant proteins suggest that BubR1 mediatedbythephosphataseCdc14 . In Drosophila andvertebrates , is largely responsible for the inhibitory activity of MCC APC Cdh1 is , in addition , inhibited by Emi1 / Rca1 , which binds to Cdh1 because this protein alone can bind to Cdc20 , prevent and thereby might prevent the binding of substrates . Phosphoryla - its interaction with the APC , and inhibit securin and tion of Cdh1 also results in its destabilization . It is conceivable that cyclin B ubiquitination in vitro ( Tang et al . , 2001a ) . In the Emi1 / Rca1 has a role in Cdh1 degradation because Emi1 is an F future it will be important to understand if MCC inhibits box protein that interacts with SCF ubiquitin ligases . Cdc20 via both its Mad2 and BubR1 subunits and if active Mad2 exists exclusively as part of MCC , or if independent checkpoint complexes exist . Likewise , it cyclins has been initiated by APC Cdc20 , raising the simple will be crucial to understand how APC Cdc20 is able to possibility that lowering Cdk1 activity may be sufficient ubiquitinate cyclin A but not B - type cyclins and securin to allow Cdh1 dephosphorylation by constitutively ac - in the presence of an activated spindle assembly check - tive protein phosphatases . However , recent work has point . revealed that regulation of Cdh1 dephosphorylation is Mitotic Exit—Switching from APC Cdc20 to APC Cdh1 more complex ( Figure 4 ) . In budding yeast , APC Cdc20 initi - During most of mitosis , Cdh1 is phosphorylated by atesmitoticcyclindegradationbutisunabletocomplete CDKs and thereby kept inactive . At the end of mitosis , it ( Baumer et al . , 2000 ; Yeong et al . , 2000 ) . A fraction Cdh1 is dephosphorylated and thus able to bind and of mitotic cyclins is protected from destruction by an activate the APC ( Blanco et al . , 2000 ; Jaspersen et al . , unknown mechanism until APC Cdh1 is activated at the 1999 ; Kramer et al . , 2000 ; Listovsky et al . , 2000 ; Lukas end of mitosis . The activation of APC Cdh1 in turn depends et al . , 1999 ; Yamaguchi et al . , 2000 ; Zachariae et al . , on the prior activation of APC Cdc20 and on the correct 1998a ) . APC Cdh1 then ubiquitinates Cdc20 and thereby positioning of the mitotic nucleus between the mother inactivates APC Cdc20 ( Pfleger and Kirschner , 2000 ; Prinz and the future daughter cell ( reviewed by Bardin and et al . , 1998 ; Shirayama et al . , 1998 ) . Around the same Amon , 2001 ) . Once these events have occurred , CDK time , one of the E2 enzymes that collaborate with the inactivation is completed by activation of APC Cdh1 and APC , UbcH10 , is degraded ( Yamanaka et al . , 2000 ) , but by the simultaneous accumulation of the CDK inhibitor the physiological consequence of this reaction is not yet Sic1 . This mechanism ensures that cells never exit from known . Neither Cdc20 proteolysis nor the degradation mitosis before anaphase has been initiated or under of UbcH10 is essential for inactivation of APC Cdc20 in conditions where chromosomes would not be segre - embryonic cell cycles because Cdc20 and orthologs gated correctly between mother and daughter cells . of UbcH10 are not degraded in early Drosophila and In yeast , activation of both APC Cdh1 and Sic1 depends Xenopus embryos that do not express Cdh1 ( King et al . , on the protein phosphatase Cdc14 , which is kept in an 1995 ; Lorca et al . , 1998 ; Sigrist and Lehner , 1997 ; Yu et inactive form in the nucleolus through most of the cell al . , 1996 ) .

How with APC Cdh1 in promoting exit from mitosis . Cdh1 is degraded is unknown , but it is conceivable that Activation of the Cdc14 phosphatase is controlled SCF complexes are involved because the recognition by at least two mechanisms . In anaphase , Cdc14 is of substrates by these ubiquitin ligases typically de - transiently released from the nucleolus by the FEAR pends on substrate phosphorylation ( reviewed by De - ( Cdc fourteen early anaphase release ) pathway ( Steg - shaies , 1999 ) . meier et al . , 2002 ) . This pathway depends on separase AlthoughCdh1phosphorylationisrequiredforAPC Cdh1 activation , but what the critical separase substrates are inactivation , the recent identification of Rca1 / Emi1 as and how the FEAR pathway disscoiates Cdc14 from an APC inhibitor suggests that phosphorylation alone Cfi1 / Net1 are not yet known . Maintenance of Cdc14 is not sufficient to prevent APC - mediated proteolysis in activity and exit from mitosis depend on a second path - Sand G2phase . Drosophila Rca1 wasinitiallycharacter - way , called the mitotic exit network ( MEN ) . The MEN ized as a regulator of cyclin A whose mutation resulted represents a signaling cascade that consists of the in a G2 arrest similar to the one caused by mutation of GTPase Tem1 , two proteins that regulate Tem1 ( a cyclin A ( Dong et al . , 1997 ) .

Activation of the MEN is cyclin degradation mediated by the Drosophila Cdh1 controlled by multiple signals , including the correct po - ortholog Fizzy - related can be inhibited by Rca1 . These sitioning of the nucleus between the mother and the observations and the earlier finding that Rca1 mutants future daughter cell , which brings the GTPase Tem1 into arrest in G2 indicate that Rca1 function is required to close proximity to its GTPase activating protein , Lte1 keep APC Cdh1 inactive during G2 , possibly because ani - ( Bardin et al . , 2000 ) .

Activation of Tem1 then foundtoinhibitAPC Cdc20 in Xenopus extracts ( seeabove ) , promotes release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus and but more recently inhibition of APC Cdh1 has also been thereby initiates exit from mitosis . reported ( Reimann et al . , 2001b ) .

Interest - RINGfinger proteins , andE2 enzymesinto closeproxim - ingly , budding yeast Cdc20 and Cdh1 appear to activate ity . Apc2 may have a similar function because it binds the APC in a substrate specific manner ; for example , to APC’s RING finger subunit , Apc11 , which in turn is Cdc20 being required for degradation of the securin able to bind E2 enzymes and to support ubiquitination Pds1 but not for complete proteolysis of Clb2 which reactions in vitro ( Gmachl et al . , 2000 ; Leverson et al . , in turn depends on Cdh1 ( Visintin et al . , 1997 ) . This 2000 ; Tang et al . , 2001b ) . However , it remains unknown observation suggested early on that Cdc20 and Cdh1 how substrates are recruited to Apc2 - Apc11 . may activate the APC by recruiting specific substrates The APC is unusual among ubiquitin ligases with re - to the ubiquitin ligase , at least in budding yeast ( in Dro - spect to its subunit complexity .

This complexity is Recent support for the hypothesis that Cdc20 and surprising because many other ubiquitin ligases are only Cdh1 recruit substrates to the APC comes from two composedofoneorafewsubunits , implyingthatubiqui - observations .
