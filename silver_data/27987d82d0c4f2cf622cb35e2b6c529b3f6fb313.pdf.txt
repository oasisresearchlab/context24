However , the detailed mechanisms underlying nucleus - cytoplasm volumetric coupling remain unknown . Recent evidence supports a primary role of osmotic mechanisms in determining a tight link between nuclear and cytoplasmic volume , but this hypothesis remains largely untested in mammalian cells . We approach the question in single cultured adhering human cells , by jointly measuring cytoplasmic and nuclear volumes , in real time and across cell cycles . Surprisingly , we find that cytoplasmic and nuclear volumes follow different average growth laws : while the cytoplasm grows exponentially , the nucleus grows linearly . Moreover , by combining several experimental perturbations and analyzing a mathematical model including osmotic effects and tension , we conclude that the mechanical forces exerted by the cytoskeleton on the nuclear envelope can strongly affect nucleus - cytoplasm volumetric coupling by biasing nuclear import . Our results unveil how osmo - mechanical equilibrium regulates nuclear size in mammalian cells . One - Sentence Summary : Cytoskeletal forces exerted on the nuclear envelope impact on nuclear volume through modulation of force - coupled nucleo - cytoplasmic transport , affecting osmosis . 2 5 10 15 Submitted Manuscript : Confidential Main Text : In all living systems , size control of cells and intracellular organelles is essential for the optimal regulation of several biological functions ( 1 – 3 ) . In multicellular organisms , cell and organelle size is a characteristic feature of a given cell type , and both cell - to - cell and mean variations are often associated to pathological conditions such as cancer or aging ( 4 , 5 ) . The size of the nucleus , the largest cellular organelle , generally scales linearly with cell size . In yeast , nuclear to cell volumetric ratio ( karyoplasmic ratio or NC ratio ) is roughly constant along the entire cell - cycle ( 6 – 8 ) . However , for mammalian cells , the detailed mechanisms underlying nucleus - cytoplasm volume coupling are still mostly unclear ( 9 ) . To address this problem , we developed a technique , which we named nuclear fluorescence exclusion microscopy ( N2FXm ) , for measuring jointly , and in real time , both nuclear and cytoplasmic volumes of living cells . This method was conceived as an evolution of fluorescence exclusion microscopy ( FXm ) , an imaging - based technique that allows measuring cellular volumes using low - magnification objectives ( 10 – 12 ) . In standard FXm , cells are injected in a microfluidic chamber of known height filled with a fluorescent dye , in our case high molecular weight RED - dextran , which is not internalized by cells . For any object in the chamber , the corresponding drop in dextran fluorescence is linearly proportional to its volume . Consequently , dextran fluorescence can be scaled linearly between two points of known height : zero , where the chamber is empty , and the maximum , the known chamber height , in correspondence of the pillars sustaining the chamber roof . This calibration allows us to define the optical thickness of cells of arbitrary shape in the chamber and , accordingly , cell volume can be precisely computed by integrating it over the segmented cell area ( see materials and methods , Fig . S1A - B ) . N2FXm extends the FXm technique to nuclear volume measurements . Cell nuclei were negatively stained with the ectopic expression of a green fluorescent protein coupled with a nuclear export signal ( GFP - NES ) , which localizes in the entire cytoplasm except the nucleus , which is also marked with H2B - BFP ( see materials and methods , Fig . 1A - B and S1C - E ) . In this doubly - labeled system , and in presence of the extracellular dye , a second calibration is introduced and the cytoplasmic GFP fluorescent signal is scaled accordingly to cell optical thickness . The two calibration steps generate calibrated images for both cell and cytoplasm , obtained from dextran and GFP fluorescent signals , respectively . Since the latter is scaled according to the former , intensity profiles from the two images differ only in correspondence of the nucleus , where the difference of the two is proportional to the nuclear height ( Fig . S1C ) . Finally , to measure nuclear 3 5 10 15 20 25 30 Submitted Manuscript : Confidential volume , the calibrated GFP signal is integrated within the segmented nuclear region , subtracting the resulting value from the cell volume evaluated over the same domain ( see materials and methods , Fig . S1 - E and Supporting video S1 ) . Cytoplasmic volume is obtained by subtracting the nuclear volume from the entire cell volume and the NC ratio as the ratio between nuclear and cytoplasmic volumes . To test our method , we used N2FXm to measure the volumes of spherical polymeric µ - particles ( DAAM particles ( 13 ) , see material and methods ) internalized by RPE1 cells . N2FXm measurements were in good agreement with the volumes estimated with a geometrical measurement ( see materials and methods and Fig . SG - I , linear fit coefficients of SI : slope = 0 . 94 , Pearson correlation coefficient = 0 . 89 , R 2 = 0 . 78 ) . Moreover , the distribution of the volume ratio estimated by N2FXm and geometrical measurements was compatible with a normal distribution centered on 1 , excluding possible systematic errors in our procedure ( Fig S1H ) . We also compared nuclear volume distribution of RPE1 cells measured with both N2FXm and 3D confocal reconstruction ( see materials and methods ) obtaining similar results ( Fig . S1F ) . Finally , we assessed if the ectopic expression of GFP - NES or H2B - BFP perturbed cell or nuclear dimensions and we did not find any meaningful differences ( Figure S1J - K ) . To summarize , the main advantages of N2FXm are : 1 ) both cell and nuclear volumes are obtained from a single plane illumination , avoiding 3D reconstruction ; 2 ) the technique works with small magnification and low numerical aperture objectives , enabling the simultaneous record of many cells in the same field of view ; 3 ) the imaging needs low illumination , reducing phototoxicity and making the technique suitable for long - term experiments ( see supporting video S1 ) . We employed N2FXm to explore the nucleus - cytoplasm volumetric coupling in non - synchronized proliferating cells from 5 different epithelial cell lines , normal and transformed : RPE1 , MCF10A , MCF7 , DCIS . com and MCF10 - CA , ( Fig . 1D - F , S1L ) . Surprisingly , cytoplasm and nucleus volume mean temporal trajectories clearly show that NC ratio is not constant over the cell cycle ( Fig . 1F and Fig . S1L ) , differently from earlier reports for yeast and from what hypothesized for decades per mammalian cells ( 6 , 7 ) . To gain a deeper understanding of the homeostatic nucleus - cytoplasm coupling , we exploited N2FXm analyzing single - cell dynamic measurements of cytoplasmic and nuclear volumes . Initially , we considered three specific time - points across cell division : I , the instant preceding nuclear envelope breakdown ( NEB ) ; II , the onset of cellular roundup at division ; and III , the instant successive to the post - mitotic nuclear expansion ( PME ) ( for point identification methods , 4 5 10 15 20 25 30 Submitted Manuscript : Confidential see “Curve generation and point detection” section in supporting information , Fig . 2A - B and fig S2 - A ) . We found that NEB systematically precedes the onset of cellular roundup by ~ 10 - 20 min ( Fig . 2C ) . However , the temporal resolution of our experiments ( 10 min ) was too small to precisely distinguish these two events . Moreover , we found a strong positive correlation between both nuclear and cytoplasmic volumes at NEB and PME , the end of a cell cycle and the start of the following one respectively ( Fig . 2D ) . These results are in line with previous findings and reinforce the idea that “size - memory” mechanisms act to preserve both cytoplasm and nuclear dimensions of the cell population ( 12 ) . Interestingly , while on average cytoplasmic volume almost perfectly halves across cell division ( 12 ) , the nucleus decreases on average by ~ 2 . 5 times ( Fig . 2E ) . This implies a non - constancy of the NC volume ratio between NEB and PME ( Fig . 2F ) . These observations also suggested non - trivial homeostatic coupling mechanisms between cytoplasm and nucleus . Then , to test volumetric growth speed of the two cellular compartments , we computed the conditional averages of growth speed ( dV / dt ) at fixed size and analyzed their average trends . We found that cytoplasm and nucleus grow following different average growth laws . For all analyzed cell lines ( confirming previous reports ( 12 , 14 , 15 ) ) the cytoplasm grows exponentially , with growth speed linearly increasing with cytoplasm size , while the nucleus grows linearly , with constant growth speed at varying nuclear size ( Fig . 2G and S2 - B ) . Overall , these results indicate that in mammalian cells the nucleus - cytoplasm volumetric coupling could not be simply defined by a pure osmotic equilibrium , which would lead , instead , to a constant value of the NC ratio ( 16 , 17 ) . To explore the biophysical factors regulating the nucleus - cytoplasm volumetric coupling , we performed a set of experiments on shorter time scales , to osmotically or mechanically perturb RPE1 cells . These stimuli are known to impact on both cell and nuclear volume ( 18 – 21 ) . We coupled these experiments with measurements of the cytoskeletal forces acting on the nuclear envelope ( NE ) , using a FRET sensor based on the LINC complex protein Nesprin 1 ( Fig . S3 A - B ) ( 22 ) . We also used a set of simple biophysical models to rationalize the results ( see SI appendix ) ( 16 , 17 ) . In the basic version of this model , NC volumes are set only by osmosis and surface tensions are negligible . As expected from a purely osmotic model , hyperosmotic shock induced a substantial shrinkage of both nuclear and cytoplasmic volumes , leaving NC ratio and cytoskeletal forces acting on the nuclear envelope unmodified ( Fig . S3A - B ) . Our model also shows that the same behavior is expected for a non - negligible constant surface tension , with a small correction on the slope , but the expected nuclear volume changes due to external forces are 5 5 10 15 20 25 30 Submitted Manuscript : Confidential small . Conversely , lowering cytoskeletal forces exerted on NE , as induced in suspended , latrunculin - treated or ROCK inhibitor Y - 27632 treated cells ( see supporting information ) , caused a substantial nuclear volume decrease , with only minor effects on the cytoplasmic volume ( Fig S3A - B ) . Clearly , these biophysical changes also lead to significant variations of the NC ratio ( Fig . S3A ) and falsify the expectations of a purely osmotic model ( SI appendix ) . Exploiting N2FXm to its full potential , we then analyzed the volumetric dynamic response during three kind of perturbations : hyperosmotic shock , cell detachment and cell spreading . In cells subjected to a hyperosmotic shock , both nuclear and cytoplasmic volumes simultaneously decreased without any detectable lag ( at the temporal resolution of our experiments , 2 min ) , and with negligible effects on the NC ratio ( Fig . 3B - D and S3B ) , once again confirming the osmotic model . Moreover , the force acting on NE , independently assessed , was mostly unaffected along hyperosmotic shocks ( Fig . 3E ) . Instead , during cell detachment , both nuclear volume and force on NE decreased , with no considerable effects on cytoplasmic volume ( Fig . 3G - J ) . Equally , during spreading , nuclear volume and force on NE increased and the cytoplasmic volume decreased ( Fig . 3L - O ) ( 23 ) . Altogether , these results confirmed the osmotic coupling existing between nucleus and cytoplasm , which coherently react to an osmotic perturbation ( Fig . 4A ) . However , they also highlight that external mechanical forces exerted on the NE must be an important regulator of nuclear volume . Indeed , during cell detachment or spreading , or upon cytoskeleton perturbations , nuclear and cytoplasmic volumes are strongly decoupled , with nuclear volume variations coherent with the changes of forces exerted on the NE and not with the changes of cytoplasmic volume ( Fig . 4A ) . Based on the model , we reasoned that this was very unlikely to be a direct effect , as the direction of the effect is opposite to the expectation from cytoskeletal compressive forces ( 24 ) , and the mechanical forces required to change nuclear size would be abnormally large ( see SI appendix ) . Instead , recent findings suggest that NE tension , controlling nuclear pore size , could alter nuclear import rate of small proteins ( 25 – 28 ) potentially affecting osmosis ( 29 ) . We explored a model variant where , in addition to the osmotic equilibrium , we added a term reflecting the contributions of the mechano - mediated regulation of nucleo - cytoplasmic transport ( Fig . 4B and S3E , and SI appendix ) . This model , calibrated with data from refs . ( 17 , 25 ) , suggests that moderate tension changes may affect nuclear size through this effect ( SI appendix and Fig 4A - B and S3E ) . Hence , we tested this hypothesis experimentally . We first quantified nuclear import efficiency as a function of the force acting on NE , using as proxy the nucleus - cytoplasm 6 5 10 15 20 25 30 Submitted Manuscript : Confidential fluorescence intensity ratio in cells expressing GFP - NLS protein . We found that perturbations decreasing the extent of forces exerted on NE always decrease nuclear import efficiency ( Fig . 4C ) . We then assessed volume dynamics in spreading cells treated with ivermectin , an inhibitor of the α / ß importins transport pathway ( 30 ) , at a concentration affecting nuclear import but unable to perturb none cytoplasmic or nuclear volume , NC ratio or forces acting on the NE ( Fig . 4C S3C - D ) . During spreading , despite as in untreated cells forces on NE increases and cytoplasm volume decreases , importins impairment lead to a significantly slower nuclear volume increase ( Fig . 3M - O ) . Hence , we conclude that the observed force - related volumetric decoupling was mainly linked to a modulation of the nuclear import . This mechanism can tune the nuclear macromolecular content and thereby controls nuclear volume “amplifying” the sensed forces ( 29 ) . In conclusion , the N2FXm methods , overcoming common limitations on simultaneous dynamic measurements of cell and nuclear volume in living cells , allowed us to decipher fundamental mechanisms of nuclear - cytoplasmic volume coupling . Unexpectedly , we found that in mammalian cells , cytoplasm and nucleus grow differently , exponentially vs linearly . This observation already implies that simple osmotic coupling alone cannot explain nuclear volume dynamics , and more complex homeostatic process must be in place . Our results also show that one of them is related to a sophisticated mechano - sensing mechanism biasing nuclear transport . Indeed , forces exerted by the cytoskeleton , affecting NE tension , impact on nuclear pores size ( 26 – 28 ) . This , in turn , regulates nuclear - cytoplasmic transport of NLS tagged proteins , affecting osmosis . Accordingly , specific transcription factor such as YAP , key regulator of organ growth and regeneration as well as of mechanotransduction , also are affected by this mechanism , establishing intriguing links between biophysical and regulatory pathways to be explored in the future . Finally , nuclear volume regulation , controlling concentration of nuclear components and translocation of transcription factors , impacts chromatin state and nuclear organization , broadly affecting cell activity . 7 5 10 15 20 25 Submitted Manuscript : Confidential References and Notes 1 .

MCF10 - A ATCC and DCIS . com cells ( Barts Cancer Institute , Queen Mary University of 924 London , UK ) were cultured in DMEM - F12 supplemented with 5 % horse serum , 10µg / ml human insulin , 0 . 5mg / ml hydrocortisone and 20ng / ml epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) . MCF10 - A medium were cultured using the same DCIS . com medium and further supplemented with 100 ng / ml cholera toxin . MCF10 - CA cells ( Barts Cancer Institute , Queen Mary University of 924 London , UK ) were cultured in DMEM - F12 supplemented with 5 % horse serum , 1 . 05 mM calcium chloride and 10mM HEPES . MCF7 NCI cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium . All the cell lines were grown at 37 °C and in humified atmosphere with 5 % CO2 . Cell transfection , lentiviral production and cell transduction Lentiviral particles were produced as described here ( 31 ) . Briefly , 3x10 6 HEK293T cells were transfected with pCDH lentiviral plasmids encoding H2B - BFP or 2X _ NES - GFP ( nuclear exportation signal ) , or MiniNesprin1 _ FRET sensor , together with psPax2 and pMD2 . G vectors with a ratio of 4µg : 2µg : 1µg using Polyethylenimine ( PEI ) as transfection reagent . 24h later medium was removed , and virus collection performed after 24 / 48 / 72h . Viral aliquots were pulled 1 together and filtered with 0 . 45µm filters . 2x10 5 cells were transduced with 1ml of fresh virus supplemented with Polybrene ( 8  g / ml ) through 20’ of centrifugation at 2000rpm , then seeded in 6 well plates . Cell transfection of hTERT _ RPE1 cells was performed using Neon Transfection System ( Thermo Fischer Scientific ) following the manufacturer ' s protocol . Expression of nuclear GFP was obtained through a plasmid encoding a NLS ( nuclear localization signal ) tagged eGFP ( Addgene # 67652 ) . N2FXm Chip fabrication The N2FXm chip is a microfluidic device composed by two “acquisition” chambers connected by “loading” channels ( Fig . S1A ) . Acquisition chambers are 18 µm in height and used to image cells for volume measurements . Reservoir channels are higher ( ~ 150 µm ) and ensure a continuous nutrient delivery to cells in the acquisition chambers ( Fig . S1A ) . Microstructured silicon mold were used to create the N2FXm chip . The template wafers were fabricated at the cleanroom facilities of the Binning and Rohrer Nanotechnology Center ( BRNC ) using a standard two step - photolithography process ( 32 ) . First , the pillars in the central chamber were etched until a final depth of 18 µm . Finally , the lateral channels were added by crosslinking a 150 µm thick layer of SU - 8 resist . The resulting silicon wafers were passivated as follow : soaking for 30 minutes in a silanization solution I ( Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) , then 10 minutes in hexane ( Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) , 10 minutes in 1 - octanol ( Sigma - Aldrich , USA ) , and finally rinsed with acetone and deionized water . ( Silicon master fabrication ) . The microfluidic chip was then fabricated in PDMS ( Sylgard 184 ) through standard replica molding . Briefly , the PDMS precursor was mixed with the crosslinker ( 10 : 1 ) and poured on the silicon mold , degassed for 1h in a vacuum bell and then cured for 3h at 90 °C . Once demolded , 1 . 5 mm diameter punches were made in correspondence of the inlet and outlet of the chip . The chip was then treated for 1 min with oxygen plasma and irreversibly bonded to a 35 mm bottom - glass petri dish ( Mattek ) . To reinforce the bonding treatment , the bonded device was heated for 30 min at 40 °C . To prevent medium leakages , two PDMS cubes ( height ~ 3 mm ) were punched ( 2 mm diameter ) and bonded in correspondence of the inlet and outlet . The day before the experiment , the chip was retreated for 1 min with oxygen plasma , filled with fibronectin at the appropriate concentration ( 10 µg / ml 2 for RPE1 cells , 20 µg / ml for all the other cell lines ) and incubated at RT for 1h . The chip was then rinsed with PBS , filled with the appropriate medium and incubated overnight at 37 °C . The day of the experiment , cells were injected in the chip at ~ 300x10 3 cells / ml . The petri dish was humified ( filled with medium ) to prevent medium evaporation from the chambers during the experiment . For all the experiments excepting spreading , after 3 - 6 h from cell injection ( the time necessary to ensure a good adhesion of a specific cell line ) , the culture medium was replaced with a medium containing 70kDa Texas Red Dextran at 1mg / ml ( Thermofisher Scientific ) and , after additional 3h , the microfluidic system was imaged at the microscope . In the case of spreading experiments , cells were instead directly resuspended in the Texas Red Dextran containing medium , injected in the chip and imaged ~ 15 min later . N2FXm for Nuclear Volume measurement Cell and nuclear volumes were measured imaging GFP - nes and H2B - BFP positive cells in the N2FXm chip filled with a fluorescent dye ( Dextran Texas red 70 kDa Neutral , Invitrogen ) not internalized by cells ( see “Chip fabrication” section , Fig . S1 - A ) . We acquired images in 4 channels : transmitted light , red ( dextran ) , green ( GFP - NES ) and blue ( nuclear staining ) . Images were analyzed using ImageJ . First , dextran field illumination homogeneity was corrected dividing the original image by a correction / normalization image , which was obtained by dividing the smoothed original image ( or the maximal projection or multiple frames , in case of acquisitions longer than 1 time point ) for its mode . Here , the smoothing was obtained applying a median filter with a radius value ranging from 35 - 50 , which corresponded to the minimum value needed to eliminate the contribute of the pillars ( i . e . that appeared as black circles in the image ) from the mode calculation of the dextran channel . Then , as in Zlotek Zlotkiewicz et al . , ‐ drop of dextran intensity in correspondence of cells was used to calculate cells volume ( 10 ) . Any object in the chamber , occupying a specific space , excludes the red fluorescent dextran from this volume . Dextran fluorescence intensity can be scaled between two points of known height : zero , where the chamber is empty and the maximum , the known chamber height ( 18um ) , in correspondence of the pillars sustaining the chamber roof ( as schematically showed in Fig . S1B ) . This calibration allowed defining the optical thickness of cells in the chamber at each pixel and was performed independently for all fields of view and all time points . Although optical thickness at each pixel can differ from cell height , its integration over a slightly enlarged cell 3 area , here automatically defined from the GFP - NES fluorescence signal , well quantify the cell volume ( Fig . S1C - E ) ( 10 ) . For measuring nuclear volumes , a second calibration was introduced . Cell nuclei were negatively stained with the ectopic expression of a green fluorescent protein coupled with a nuclear export signal ( GFP - NES ) , which localizes in the entire cytoplasm except the nucleus , also marked with H2B - BFP ( see “Cell transfection , lentiviral production and cell transduction” section ) . Since we assume that the intensity of the GFP signal is linearly proportional to the volume of the corresponding portion of cytoplasm , it can as well be calibrated according to the one of calibrated dextran . The GFP calibration was then performed fitting the conditional average of GFP intensity in the cytoplasm ( all cell excluding the nucleus ) at fixed optical thickness ( Fig . S1C - E ) . Cytoplasm and nucleus were automatically defined by combining the GFP and BFP signals ( Fig . S1E ) . Linear fitting was carried out in R using the “robustbase” package [ Maechler M , Rousseeuw P , Croux C , Todorov V , Ruckstuhl A , Salibian - Barrera M , Verbeke T , Koller M , Conceicao EL , Anna di Palma M ( 2021 ) . robustbase : Basic Robust Statistics . R package version 0 . 93 - 9 , http : / / robustbase . r - forge . r - project . org / ] . Importantly , to correct for possible signal fluctuation or variation of GFP expression , GFP calibration was performed at each timepoint and for each analyzed cell . In order to strengthen the calibration , we introduced also the possibility to perform and mediate it over a variable number of timepoints ( nzz ) . Volume trajectories relative to asynchronous cells along the cell cycle ( Fig . 1D - F and Fig . S1M ) were obtained setting nzz = 3 ( see supporting video S1 ) . Spreading , detachment and hyperosmotic shock dynamic experiments were analyzed with nzz = 1 . Finally , to measure nuclear volume , the calibrated GFP signal was integrated within the nuclear region , and the resulting value subtracted from cell volume evaluated over the same domain ( see materials and methods and Fig . S1 - E ) . Cytoplasmic volume was calculated by subtracting the nuclear volume from the entire cell volume and the NC ratio as the ratio between nuclear and cytoplasmic volumes . Live imaging experiments All live imaging experiments were performed at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 atmosphere . FXm experiments were performed using a LEICA widefield DMI8 inverted system equipped with a 4 HC PL Fluotar 10x NA = 0 . 32 ( Leica , # 506522 ) objective . The excitation source was a LED illumination . Images were acquired with a sCMOS Andor Neo 5 . 5 camera . FRET experiments and 3D reconstruction were both performed with an inverted LEICA confocal SP8 equipped with a HC PL APO 40x , NA = 1 , 30 OIL immersion ( Leica , # 506358 ) or a HC PL APO 63x , NA = 1 , 40 OIL immersion ( Leica , # 506350 ) objective , respectively . GFP - NLS nuclear - cytoplasmic localization was obtained with an inverted spinning disk ( CSU - X1 Perkin Elmer Ultraview ) Nikon Ellipse Ti , equipped with Nikon PLAN Fluor 40X 1 . 3 OIL objective and a Hamamatsu EM - CCD C9100 camera . DAAM particle measurement and N2FXm precision Poly - acrylamide - co - acrylic acid particles ( DAAM particles ) were used for evaluating the precision of our technique . In particular , if internalized by the cell , DAAM particles are excluded by the cytoplasmic staining ( while increasing the total cell volume ) and their volume could be then measured using our technique . DAAM particles were preferred to glass beads because the refractive index ( RI ) of the latter ( RI > 1 . 47 ) was too different from that of the water ( RI ~ 1 . 33 ) and generated optical artifacts , while DAAM RI ranged between 1 . 33 and 1 . 34 ( 11 ) . DAAM particles were produced as previoulsy decribed with a mean diameter of 3 . 5 µm ( 11 ) . DAAM particles were resuspended at 50x10 6 beads / ml in the RPE1 cells medium and injected in the acquisition chamber containing adhered RPE1 cells . After 4 h from particle injection , culture medium was replaced with Texas red dextran ( 1mg / ml ) containing medium . To estimate the error , volumes of the internalized particles were quantified with our technque ( e . g . measured volume ) and compared with the ones obtained through a geometrical calculation ( e . g . expected volume ) ( Fig . S1G - I ) . Here , because of the particle spherical shape , expected volumes could be calculated measuring particle diameter ( averaged between two measurements ) . This procedure was performed manually and not by an automatic measurement . Moreover , we compared nuclear volume distribution measured with the N2FXm with the one obtained by means of confocal 3D reconstruction . 3D reconstruction was performed by imaging RPE1 cells in the same culture condition used for the N2FXm experiments ( see “chip microfabrication” section ) . Cells were then acquired along z with a step size 0 . 3 µm . The stacks 5 were then analyzed with the 3D object counter plugin of ImageJ . From this analysis , we did not find statistical differences between the volumes obtained with the two methods ( Fig . S1F ) . Drug and adhesion experiments All the drug experiments were performed for both volume ( N2FXm ) and nuclear tension ( FRET ) measurements . For N2FXm , drugs were added at the proper concentration to the specific medium ( containing the fluorescent dextran ) and injected in the device containing adherent cells ( as described in the “Chip fabrication” section ) . In GFP - NLS localization experiments , all the condition were explored excepting for hyperosmotic shock . For perturbing cytoskeleton and cell mechanics , latranculin - A ( LatA , Sigma Aldrich ) and Y - 27632 ( Y27 , Sigma Aldrich ) were added to the culture medium at 1µM and 500µM , respectively . Cells were then imaged after 1h ( for LatA ) or 12h ( for Y27 ) . For hyper - osmotic shock experiments , D - sucrose ( Carlo Erba reagents , Dasti Group ) was resuspended in pure water at 500 mM and , to perform dynamic measurements , added to cells during imaging . Detachment experiments were performed by adding EDTA to a serum - free culture medium at ( 0 . 05 % ) . As in the case of osmotic shock experiments , EDTA containing medium was added during imaging for obtaining dynamic measurement . Spreading experiments were conducted by imaging cells ~ 15 min after seeding . Here , untreated ( control ) cells and cells pre - treated with ivermectin ( Sigma Aldrich , 10 µM for 24 h ) were used . In N2FXm dynamic experiments ( i . e . hyper - osmotic shock , detachment and spreading ) , cells were acquired each 2 min ( see supporting video S2 ) . In FRET dynamic measurements cells were acquired each 3 min during osmotic shock and detachment , while during spreading each 10 min . The lower acquisition rates used for spreading FRET experiments were justified by the need to perform z - stack acquisitions ( z step size = 1µm ) for accounting cell movements along the z axis . Curve generation and point detection All the figures and statistical analysis were performed in R . Packages used were : “robustbase” , “ggplot2” , “gridExtra” , “rcarbon” , “ggsignif ” , “rcarbon” , “rsvg” . 6 All the plotted dynamic datasets were smoothed using the “runMean” function ( “fill” smoothing option on 3 points ) . In all the smoothed datasets , eventual NA were removed using the “na _ interpolation” ( linear option ) function . To generate mean volume and ratio trajectories of non - synchronized growing cells ( Fig . 1E - F and S1M ) , single curves were first temporally aligned and then mediated over time . Here , cytokinesis was used as reference time point ( represented as the time “0 min” ) , which was manually identified for each cell analyzed from the acquired images . Nuclear envelope breakdown ( NEB ) , postmitotic expansion ( PME ) and roundup onset points relative to single cell trajectories were automatically detected ( Fig . 2A and S2A ) . The detection was performed as follows : NEB : This point was detected by combining the first and the second differential of smoothed nuclear volume data ( runMean function , “fill” smoothing option on 3 points ) . In particular , the NEB was defined 1 point before the last positive value of the first differential , which was considered in a 10 points wide window preceding the maximum value of the second differential before division . The second differential was analyzed in a 15 points window before division . PME : 5 points successive to the minimum value of the second differential of smoothed nuclear volume data ( runMean function , “fill” smoothing option on 15 points or on the maximum length of the nuclear trajectory after division , if the latter was lower than 15 ) , considering a 15 points wide window after division . Roundup onset : 2 points before the maximum value of the second differential of the smoothed cytoplasmic volume data ( runMean function , “fill” smoothing option on 15 points or on the maximum length of the nuclear trajectory before division , if the latter was lower than 15 ) , considering a 15 points wide window before division . All the detected points were manually checked . To generate the normalized dynamic mean curves relative to volumes , NC ratio and inverted FRET index ( fig . 3C - E , H - J , M - O ) during spreading , detachment and osmotic shock experiments , single curves were first smoothed by means of the runMean function ( “linear” smoothing option on 3 points ) . Successively , data relative to each curve were divided by their first value to be normalized . Finally , all the curves were mediated over time . 7 Growth Speed analysis Cytoplasm and nuclear growth modes were obtained by analyzing the volume growth speed ( dV / dt ) in function of the volume ( V ) . Here , because of the already reported high variability of single cell trajectories ( 13 ) , growth modes were evaluated considering the population averages , and in particular the trend of the conditional averages . In this analysis , the two limit cases are represented by the linear and the exponential growth modes , characterized by a constant or linearly increasing value of the growth speed in function of the volume , respectively . First , single cell volumetric data ( i . e . nucleus and cytoplasm volumes used for obtaining the mean volumes trajectories of Fig . 1E and Fig . S1L ) were smoothed with a central average algorithm considering a sliding window of 20 frames . To calculate the growth speed ( dV / dt ) , a linear fit of single - cell volume curves as a function of time were performed on sliding windows of 12 frames . To get the average population behavior , growth speeds were mediated within 9 volumetric intervals defined to cover the entire volumetric dynamic range . To plot together cytoplasmic and nuclear volume growth speeds curves , volumes were normalized respect to their mean values . Nuclear Envelope tension analysis and synthesis of a novel cpst - FRET sensor The extent of cytoplasmic forces acting on the Nuclear Envelope ( NE ) was measured exploiting a novel circularly permutated stFRET ( cpstFRET ) ( 28 ) sensor . The sensor has been built using Nesprin 1 protein as backbone and named Mini - Nesprin 1 . A detailed explanation about how this construct was created is reported here ( ( 20 ) ) . Briefly , N - terminus Nesprin 1 ( 1521bp , aa 1 - 507 ) and C - terminus ( 1422bp , aa 8325 - 8797 ) coding sequences containing Nesprin 1 Calponin ( CH - CH ) and KASH domains respectively were synthesized exploiting IDT gBlocks Gene Fragments Technology . A circularly permutated stFRET ( cpstFRET ) probe was inserted between the two blocks . Final coding sequence of Mini Nesprin1 cpstFRET sensor was obtained through molecular cloning and inserted into a pCDH lentiviral plasmid . Image acquisition was performed using a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope with microscope with Argon light laser as excitation source tuned at 458 nm and HC PL APO CS2 ×40 / 1 . 30 oil - immersion objective . 8 Emission signals were captured at 490 - 510nm and 515 - 535nm , and inverted FRET index calculated as their ratio . Data were analyzed using in - house ImageJ macro . GFP - NLS localization analysis Nucleoplasmic transport was evaluated by quantifying the nucleus on cytoplasm mean intensity ratio of GFP - NLS protein . All the images were analyzed with ImageJ . Here , higher ratios indicate higher active molecular nuclear import . 1 . M . B . Ginzberg , R . Kafri , M . Kirschner , On being the right ( cell ) size .

( E ) Quantitative prediction of the developed theoretical model describing the effects on nuclear volume mediated by a transport biased mechanism ( continuous line ) or by a direct force ( dashed line ) . The plot reports the predicted fold change in nuclear volume ( y axis ) for increasing applied extensile tension σ ext . Parameter values : cytoplasmic volume V C = 2000 μ m 3 , 20 % fraction NLS / NES proteins in absence of applied tension , and a tension - transport bias of η = 4 10 3 m / N ( estimated from Andreu et al . 2021 ( 26 ) , see SI appendix ) . This model neglects direct effect of extensile tension on nuclear size . The dashed line instead refers to the direct effects of applied extensile tension , which lead only to a mild increase of nuclear volume . The plot reports the predicted fold change in nuclear volume ( y axis ) at fixed cytoplasmic osmotic pressure for increasing applied extensile tension σ ext . In the plot , nuclear volume increases only by 0 . 1 % . Parameter values : α = 2 / 3 ( fraction of osmotically active proteins that are in the cytoplasm ) , basal nuclear surface tension σ 0 = 10 - 6 N / m , cytoplasmic osmotic pressure Π C = 4 kPa .

Osmo - mechanical equilibrium model for nuclear volume This SI appendix describes the mathematical model used to complement our understanding of our experimental data . Model ingredients The key ingredient of the model is the assumption that osmotic pressure plays a primary role in setting nuclear and cytoplasmic volume ( Mitchison , 2019 ) . We use a bag in a bag model , similar to refs ( Deviri and Safran , 2021 ; Lemi ` ere et al . , 2021 ) . Following these studies , we assume a spherical cell and nucleus , and that on the obervation time scales both the cell surface and the nuclear surface are at mechanical equilibrium ( Salbreux et al . , 2007 ; Venkova et al . , 2021 ) . Under these assumptions , a ﬁrst equation describes the force balance between osmotic pressure and mechanical tension at cell membrane , k B T (cid:32) N C V ( e ) C − c macroout + N I V ( e ) C − c ionsout (cid:33) = 2 σ C R C , ( 1 ) In this equation , the right hand side ( ∆Π ) is the osmotic pressure , while the left - hand side ( ∆ P ) is the contribution of mechanical forces ( in our case , surface tension and the cytoskeleton ) . In this equation V ( e ) C is the accessible cellular volume contributing to osmosis , R C is the radius of the cell , N C is the number of osmotically active macromolecules in the cell , while N I is the number of osmotically active ions in the cell , balancing respectively c macroout and c ionsout the external concentrations of macromolecules and ions . Finally , σ C is a mechanical surface tension of the cell . A variant of this equation can consider also the role of osmotically active small osmolytes . A second equation following the same principles describes mechanical equilibrium between osmotic pressure and mechanical tension at the nuclear envelope . The nucleus has pores , hence we can safely neglect ions and small osmolytes , and assume that only macromolecules are osmotically active ( Deviri and Safran , 2021 ) ( see also below ) k B T (cid:32) N N V ( e ) N − αN C V ( e ) C (cid:33) = 2 σ N R N = 2 ( σ 0 + σ ext ) R N , ( 2 ) where the notation is similar as Eq . ( 1 ) , and the suﬃx N stands for nucleus . We note that N N is the number of osmotically active proteins in the nucleus ( roughly , those that have an NLS ) , equally , we assume that αN C is the number of osmotically active proteins in the cytoplasm ( this is diﬀerent from N C , which also includes proteins that can freely shuttle ) . Finally we have decomposed the tension term into σ 0 , a ( constitutive ) nucleus surface tension and e contribution σ ext is a possible from external forces from the cytoskeleton or other active elements , of which we want to test the quantitative eﬀects . Assuming spherical symmetry , σ ext is related to external force by the relation F ext = 8 πR N σ ext Equation ( 2 ) can be seen as a simpliﬁed version of the model by Kim et al . ( Kim et al . , 2015 ) , neglecting mechanics of nuclear shape deformations . A recent study ( Andreu et al . , 2021 ) ﬁnds that nuclear import increases under force , while export is not biased . Motivated by this , and by our experimental observations , we also propose and examine a model variant incorporating the indirect eﬀects of this force - biased transport on the equilibrium nuclear size . We model this eﬀect in our simple framework as a bias on the 2 nuclear concentration of proteins , based on the external tension , following c N = c ( 0 ) N e ησ ext , where c N = N N / V ( e ) N and η is a coeﬃcient that quantiﬁes the bias . We estimate the value of η directly from experimental data from ref . ( Andreu et al . , 2021 ) below . The main assumption of this model is that cell and nucleus are always in mechanical equi - librium , because the observation time is longer than the relaxation time scales . Additionally , we neglect tension terms for the cell ( σ C ≈ 0 ) , these terms should be small following Deviri and Safran , although they may lead to corrections ( Deviri and Safran , 2021 ) . For simplicity , we also always assume spherical symmetry , neglecting any mechanical deformation . These rad - ical assumptions make the model treatable , and should not aﬀect our conclusions , which are based on qualitative behavior or on order - of - magnitude quantitative diﬀerences . In standard conditions , external macromolecular osmotic ( oncotic ) pressure on the cell should be negligi - ble . c macroout ≈ 0 , since the hyperosmotic shocks are applied with sucrose , this term becomes relevant in that case ( the relevant quantity should be c macroout + c ionsout c out . Eq . ( 2 ) neglects ions ( chromatin counterions ) for the nucleus , once again a small contribution according to Deviri and Safran ( Deviri and Safran , 2021 ) . Finally , we neglect non - osmotically accessible volume for the nucleus ( not measured in our data ) , V ( e ) N = V N and we assume that for the cell the osmotically accessible volume is the cytoplasmic volume V C . A variant considering inaccessible volumes as parameters is considered by Deviri and Safran , who show that their predictions are robust . In any case these corrections do not aﬀect qualitative behavior or vary the quantitative behavior by orders of magnitude . Under these assumptions , the model behavior is simple . External osmotic pressures ( and mechano - osmotic coupling from pumps and channels ) set a cell volume , and we can envisage a situation where the cell is ( essentially ) causally uncoupled from the nucleus , and solve Eq . ( 1 ) for the cytoplasmic osmotic pressure or equivalently cytoplasmic volume . Then these variables can be used as input variables for the nucleus , solving Eq . ( 2 ) . While highly simpliﬁed - this picture is suﬃcient to explore diﬀerent scenarios for our data , as we detail below . Estimates of relevant parameters All the key parameters and / or parameter ranges were ﬁxed from literture values . Osmotic pressures Π c and Π n are order 10000 Pa ( N / m 2 ) ( Deviri and Safran , 2021 ) . In order conﬁrm this estimate , we can use the fact that volumes are in the range of 100 - 1000 µ m 3 , while protein concentrations are known to be in the range of 2 − 4 · 10 6 molecules / µ m 3 , which means that in a compartment of ∼ 300 µ m 3 such as the nucleus there are about 3 · 10 8 proteins , and in a compartment of ∼ 2000 µ m 3 such as the cytoplasm there are about 2 · 10 9 ( to which we have to sum the contribution of the small molecules ) . Below there are some arguments on how many of them should be osmotically active ( Milo , 2013 ) . Assuming that a certain number of molecules ( probably order 10 8 − 10 9 given the above considerations ) are osmotically active in a compartment , we can obtain osmotic pressures ( Π = k B T N / V ) . For example for a nucleus of ∼ 300 µ m 3 with 3 · 10 8 proteins we get a proessure of 4 kPa . Once again , the estimates are not counting the role of ions and small osmolites in the cytoplasm , but they should be reliable for the nucleus ( and a lower bound for the cytoplasm ) . Previous studies suggest that about 80 % of the proteins are estimated to be localized ( either in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm ) ( Deviri and Safran , 2021 ) . Hence , we estimate that ( αN C + N N ) / ( N C + N N ) = 0 . 8 , which gives α ≈ 2 / 3 . Additionally , in yeast , the fraction of q of nuclearly - localized to cytoplasmically localized proteins is about 1 / 2 ( Kumar et al . , 2002 ) . However , since this factor is a major determinant of the NC volume ratio , and we ﬁnd ratios that are about 0 . 2 , we conclude that this factor must be smaller in mammalian cells . 3 The apparent tension of the nucleus , estimating σ N or σ 0 is around 10 − 6 N / m in nuclear shape ﬂuctuations experiments ( Chu et al . , 2017 ; Introini et al . , 2021 ) , but this value is an underestimation of the actual tension , since it is aﬀected by excess ﬂickering due to transient deformations of active origin ( decreasing the eﬀective tension with respect to the actual me - chanical tension ) . We can assume that this value is a lower bound for the real mechanical tension σ 0 . We assume that cytoskeletal forces are compressive , in line with the recent literature ( but we have also considered the opposite case , see below ) . In order to estimate an upper bound for the external tension generated by these forces , as well as an order of magnitude for cytoskele - tal forces , we have considered force traction measurements for cells on substrates of diﬀerent stiﬀness . For a substrate stiﬀness of 5 kPa , we measured a total traction energy of 0 . 5 fJ from the same cells ( Nastaly et al . , 2020 ) . With this value , if we assume that all the energy is trans - mitted on the nucleus ( i . e . , an upper bound for the tension ) , that this energy is σ N S , where S is the nuclear surface area . For a nucleus of radius 4 µ m this gives us σ N (cid:39) 10 − 5 N / m . Vianay and coworkers ( Vianay et al . , 2018 ) ﬁnd higher values ( about 25 fJ ) for RPE1 cells on 40 kPa substrates . This gives σ N (cid:39) 5 · 10 − 4 N / m . We can also consider the total force on a nucleus of radius 4 µ m ( 4 · 10 − 6 m ) , to exert mechanically a pressure of 1000 Pa ( this pressure would be able to perturb the osmotic pressure from the nucleus , which as discussed above is of order 4 kPa ) . Since ∆ P N = 2 σ N / R N this upper bound would correspond to an ( eﬀective ) surface tension of about 10 − 3 N / m . This value is considerably higher than the values we estimate from force traction measurements , which can already be considered upper bounds . Since total force is pressure times surface , we would need about 50 nN ( 50 · 10 − 9 N ) from the cytoseleton to obtain this force on the whole nuclear surface ( still assuming a nucleus of radius 4 µ m ) . This is equivalent to order 50 . 000 motors exerting pN forces . However , these forces on the nucleus would be observed also by traction force microscopy , by Newton’s third law . Given these considerations , we have considered a range of 10 − 6 to 10 − 3 N / m for both con - stitutive and applied mechanical tensions , and we consider that a realistic range for tensions on the nucleus applied by the cytoskeleton could be 10 − 5 − 10 − 4 N / m . In order to ﬁx the bias parameter in the model variant with force - biased transport , we used the data provided by Andreu and coworkers ( Andreu et al . , 2021 ) . In this study ( Fig 2I of the paper ) , the authors ﬁnd a change in the concentration of nuclearly localized proteins c N by a factor of 3 / 2 by using gels of stiﬀness from 1 . 5 to 30 kPa . Based on the above considerations on force traction measurements , we assume that these conditions could correspond to σ ( 1 ) ext ≈ 10 − 5 and σ ( 2 ) ext ≈ 10 − 4 respectively . Assuming as above that c N = c ( 0 ) N e ησ ext , we can now use these two conditions to calibrate this dependency , and ﬁnd η . Since c ( 2 ) N c ( 1 ) N = exp (cid:104) η ( σ ( 2 ) ext − σ ( 1 ) ext ) (cid:105) , we get η ≈ 4 · 10 3 m / N . The bag - in - a - bag model may capture the behavior of hyperosmotic shocks , but is falsiﬁed by the experimental observations for cell spreading / detachment . In order to capture the changes of nuclear volume during a hyperosmotic shock , we assume that extracellular ion concentration c ionsout changes , setting a new value for Π C = αN C / ( βV C ) , with β = ( k B T ) − 1 . We then solve Eq . ( 2 ) for V N using Π C as an input . 4 0 400 800 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 V N ( µ m 3 ) V C ( µm 3 ) σ = 10 - 3 N / m σ = 10 - 4 N / m σ = 10 - 6 N / m FIG . SM1 . Upon osmotic shocks ( on time scales of tens of minutes , before mechano - osmotic regulation takes place ( Venkova et al . , 2021 ) ) , the bag - in - a - bag model predicts nuclear volume to be proportional to cytoplasmic volume , and the proportionality becomes nonlinear only for strong nuclear surface tension . Parameter values : q = 0 . 2 ( fraction NLS / NES proteins ) σ N in the range 10 − 6 to 10 − 3 N / m ( diﬀerent solid curves ) N N = 3 · 10 8 ( nuclearly localized macromolecules ) . N N V N − αβ Π C = 2 βσ N R N , where 4 / 3 πR 3 N = V N . For negligible σ N , the solution of this equation is simply V N = N N αN C V C : = qV C , where q is the ratio between nuclearly localized ( “NLS” ) and nuclearly exported ( “NES” ) proteins , estimated above ( from yeast data ) to be close to 1 / 2 . For suﬃciently small values of the tension 1 , we can solve perturbatively the equation and obtain a tension - dependent expression , V N = qV C − z N N ( qV C ) 5 / 3 , where we have deﬁned z = 2 βσ N . Figure SM1 . reports these expressions , for parameter values within the ranges estimated above . The plot shows that ( in line with the data ) the qualitative model expectation is a proportionality between nuclear volume and cytoplasmic volume , basically set by the ratio of osmotically active particles . Tension , in the range of estimated realistic values , does not aﬀect this trend . It reduces the nuclear volume at ﬁxed cytoplasimc volume , but the changes are only slight . Compressive forces by the cyctoskeleton can contribute to this trend , but again the expected volume reduction is small . We estimate it to be at most less than 10 % compared to a 1 Speciﬁcally , the non - dimensional quantity 2 βσ N V 2 / 3 N / N N should be small , and in the range of empirically relevant parameter values that we consider this is always the case 5 tensionless nucleus for the upper bounds of the realistic values for the constitutive tension and the cytoskeletal compressive forces . As a consequence , we ﬁnd that the nuclear size changes predicted by the bag - in - a - bag model ( Deviri and Safran , 2021 ; Lemi ` ere et al . , 2021 ) in presence of changes in external forces are at odds with our experimental observations in cell spreading and detachment experiments . During cell spreading , the cytoskeleton is believed to apply compressive forces to the nucleus , which , would lead to volume - decreasing deformations , in contrast with the observed increase in volume . Viceversa for cell detachment To sum up , assuming a bag - in - a - bag framework ( i ) the volume changes observed in osmotic shocks are explained but ( ii ) the assumption that tension is too small to modify volume in a considerable way is falsiﬁed by the data . Crucially , in this prediction the external tension makes a qualitative diﬀerence . Without an applied external tension , the model is falsiﬁed , as it cannot explain why nuclear volume changes during cell spreading , while cytoplasmic volume is roughly constant . However , if the cytoskeleton exterts compressive forces , the model remains at odds with the data , as the nuclear volume increases upon spreading and decreases upon detachment and in suspended cells . Force - biased transport can predict the result of spreading / detachment experiments 200 400 600 4 ⋅ 10 - 5 8 ⋅ 10 - 5 V N ( µ m 3 ) σ ext ( N / m ) σ = 10 - 3 N / m FIG . SM2 . A bias on nuclear import caused by extensile tension can increase nuclear volume more strongly than direct tension , at ﬁxed cytoplasmic osmotic pressure . The plot reports predicted nuclear volume ( y axis ) for increasing applied extensile tension σ ext , at ﬁxed basal nuclear surface tension σ 0 . Parameter values : q = 0 . 2 ( fraction NLS / NES proteins in absence of applied tension ) σ 0 = 0 and direct eﬀect of σ ext on nuclear size neglected , η = 4 · 10 3 m / N ( tension - transport bias ) V C = 2000 µ m 3 ( cytoplasmic volume ) . Conversely , we found that extending the model to the variant including tension - biased trans - port could realistic values ( Fig . 3 in the main text ) In the following , we neglect direct eﬀects of surface tension and we assume that only tension - biased transport changes the nuclear volume . This choice is conservative , as well as simplifying the model technically . In this case , nuclear volume is simply computed as V N = N N αN C V C ( 1 + ησ ext ) = qV C ( 1 + ησ ext ) , 6 where all the parameters are speciﬁed ( see above ) . We can ask how big η needs to be , in order to create an increase in nuclear volume of at least 10 % . This is given by the condition ησ ext ≈ 0 . 1 , i . e . η ≈ 1 / ( 10 σ ext ) . Our estimate based on data from Andreu and coworkers ( Andreu et al . , 2021 ) was that η ≈ 4 · 10 3 m / N . With this value , a tension σ ext ≈ 4 · 10 − 4 N / m would be suﬃcient to achieve visible nuclear deformations . This range of tension is still on the upper end of what we estimate to be achievable from force traction data , but crucially the eﬀect of nuclear deformation on force - biased transport appears to be at least ten times stronger than the direct eﬀect . We note that we have assumed here that the the impact of the “internal” surface tension on the tension bias is negligible . Technically , this assumption avoids the problem of computing a self - consistent value for the nuclear volume . Biologically , it is possible to speculate that ( i ) the biased transport saturates at some value of the external forces and / or ( ii ) tension biased transport may show ”adaptation” , in the sense that it is zero in a resting condition ( even in presence of some external forces ) , then responds to external forces perturbing that condition . All these ingredients could be added to the model in a straightforward way . However , given the proof - of - principle aim of our modeling eﬀort , and in absence of precise data to elucidate all these mechanisms , we decided to leave these additional ingredients out of our description . Crucially , the key ingredient of the model is again qualitative : force - biased transport can explain why nuclear volume increases during cell spreading also under the assumption that the cytoskeletal forces felt by the nucleus upon cell spreading are compressive . The model can also explain the qualitative trend of the cytoskeletal perturbations in our experiments , as the release of cytoskeletal compressing forces would remove the force - biased transport , reducing nuclear size . 250 300 350 400 5 ⋅ 10 - 4 1 ⋅ 10 - 3 2 ⋅ 10 - 3 V N ( µ m 3 ) - σ ext ( N / m ) σ 0 = 10 - 2 N / m σ 0 = 10 - 6 N / m FIG . SM3 . An externally applied extensile tension can mildy increase nuclear volume , at ﬁxed cyto - plasmic osmotic pressure . The plot reports predicted nuclear volume ( y axis ) for increasing applied extensile tension σ ext , at ﬁxed basal nuclear surface tension σ 0 . Parameter values : α = 2 / 3 ( fraction of osmotically active proteins that are in the cytoplasm ) σ 0 in the range 10 − 6 to 10 − 3 N / m ( diﬀerent solid curves ) Π C = 4 kPa ( cytoplasmic osmotic pressure ) . The direct eﬀect of extensile forces would also be small . While cytoskeletal forces are generally believed to be compressive , one can also wonder whether cell spreading could associate to extensile forces which directly deform the nucleus , 7 and cell detachment to the release of these forces . To address this question , we also considered the case of σ ext < 0 , wich in our formalism can describe extensile external forces . In order to explore the eﬀect of an applied ( extensile ) tension , we solved Eq . ( 2 ) taking explicitly into account the external tension σ ext and once again for ﬁxed cytoplasmic osmotic pressure Π C . In this case it is simple to obtain an implicit expression of σ ext ( V N ) and then get the inverse function by implicit plot , − σ ext = σ 0 + 1 2 (cid:16) Π C V 1 / 3 N − N N V − 2 / 3 N k B T (cid:17) Figure SM3 . shows that , according to the bag - in - a - bag model , only ( very strong ) externally applied forces giving rise to extensile tension of order 10 − 3 − 10 − 2 N / m can noticeably aﬀect nuclear size ( in the whole range of possibly relevant constitutive nuclear tensions ) . Hence , in spreading experiments ( and within the assumptions of our modeling framework ) , only the presence of an unrealistic increasing extensile force would explain the observed increase of nuclear volume . Hence , even adding a strong extensile tension to the bag - in - a - bag framework leads to the prediction of enormous values of the tension to explain our data .
