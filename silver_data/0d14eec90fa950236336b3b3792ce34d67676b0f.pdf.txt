Reducing Analytic Error Integrating Methodologists into Teams of Substantive Experts Rob Johnston (cid:147) Paradoxically , it is the specificity of expertise that makes expert forecasts unreliable . Intelligence analysis , like other complex tasks , demands consider able expertise . It requires individuals who can recognize pat terns in large data sets , solve complex problems , and make pre dictions about future behavior or events . To perform these tasks suc cessfully , analysts must dedicate a considerable number of years to researching specific topics , pro cesses , and geographic regions . Paradoxically , it is the specificity of expertise that makes expert fore casts unreliable . While experts outperform novices and machines in pattern recognition and problem solving , expert predictions of future behavior or events are seldom as accurate as simple actuarial tables . In part , this is due to cognitive biases and processing - time con straints . In part , it is due to the nature of expertise itself and the process by which one becomes an expert . 1 energy necessary to generate new knowledge in that field . It takes a considerable amount of time and regular exposure to a large num ber of cases to become an expert . An individual enters a field of study as a novice . The novice needs to learn the guiding principles and rules(cid:151)the heuristics and con straints(cid:151)of a given task in order to perform that task . Concurrently . the novice needs to be exposed to specific cases , or instances , that test the boundaries of such heuristics . Generally , a novice will find a men tor to guide her through the process of acquiring new knowl edge . A fairly simple example would be someone learning to play chess . The novice chess player seeks a mentor to teach her the object of the game , the number of spaces , the names of the pieces , the function of each piece , how each piece is moved , and the necessary conditions for winning or losing the game . Dr . Rob Johnston is a postdoctoral research fellow at the CIA Center for the Study of Intelligence and a member of the research staff at the Institute for Defense Analyses . Becoming an Expert Expertise is commitment coupled with creativity . Specifically , it is the commitment of time , energy , and resources to a relatively narrow field of study and the creative More than 200 individuals contributed to this study The author is indebted to the re searchers . fellows , and staff at the center for the Study of intelligence , the Institute for Dc - tense Analyses , the National Military intelli gence Association , Evidence Based Research , tnc . , and ANSER inc Staff and students at the CIA University , the Joint Military intelligence college , the Naval Postgraduate school , Co lumbia University , Georgetown University . and Yale University also contributed to the project . In time , and with much practice , the novice begins to recognize pat terns of behavior within cases and , thus , becomes a journeyman . With more practice and exposure to increasingly complex cases , the journeyman finds patterns not only within cases but also between cases . More importantly , the jour neyman learns that these patterns often repeat themselves over time . The journeyman still maintains reg ular contact with a mentor to solve specific problems and learn more complex strategies . Returning to the example of the chess player , the individual begins to learn pat terns of opening moves , offensive 57 Report Documentation Page Form Approved OMB No . 0704 - 0188 Public reporting burden for the collection of information is estimated to average 1 hour per response , including the time for reviewing instructions , searching existing data sources , gathering and maintaining the data needed , and completing and reviewing the collection of information .

THIS PAGE unclassified Standard Form 298 ( Rev . 8 - 98 ) Prescribed by ANSI Std Z39 - 18 Expert Teams Apprenticeship . is stifi a standard method of and defensive game - playing strate gies , and patterns of victory and defeat . When a journeyman starts to make and test hypotheses about future behavior based on past expef i ences , she begins the next transition Once she creatively gen erates knowledge . rather than simply matching superficial pat terns , she hecomes an expert At this point , she is confident in her knowledge and no longer needs a mentor as a guide(cid:151)she becomes responsible for her own knowl edge . In the chess example . once a journeyman begins competing against experts , makes predictions based on patterns , and tests those predictions against actual behavior , she is generating new knowledge and a deeper understanding of the game . She is creating her own cases rather than relying on thc cases of others . The chess example is a i(cid:146)ather short description of an apprenticeship model . Apprenticeship may seem like a restrictive 18th century mode of education , but it is still a stan dard method of training for many complex tasks . Academic doctoral programs are based on an appren ticeship model , as are fields like law , music , engineering , and medi cine . Graduate students enter fields of study , find mentors , and begin the long process of becoming inde pendent experts and generating new knowledge in their respective domains . To some , playing chess may appear rather trivial when compared , for example , with making medical diagnoses , but both are highly com plex tasks . Chess has a well - defined set of heuristics , whereas medical diagnoses seem more open ended and variable . In both training for many complex tasks . instances , however , there are tens , if not hundreds , of thousands of potential patterns . A research study discovered that chess masters had spent between 10 . 000 and 20 , 000 hours , or more than ten years , studying and playing chess . On average , a chess master stores . 50 , 000 different chess patterns in long - term memory . 2 Similarly , a diagnostic radiologist spends eight years in full time med ical training(cid:151)four years of medical school and four years of resi dency(cid:151)before she is qualified to take a national board exam and begin independent practice . 3 According to a 1988 study , the average diagnostic radiology resi dent sees forty cases per day , oi(cid:146) around 12 , 000 cases per year . 5 At the end of a residency , a diagnos tic radiologist has stored , on average , 48 , 000 cases in long turin memory . Psychologists and cognitive scien tists agree that the time it takes to become an expert depends on the complexity of the task and thu number of cases , or patterns , to which an individual is exposed . The more complex the task , the longer it takes to build expertise , or , more accurately , the longer it takes to experience and store a large number of cases or patterns The Power of Expertise Experts are individuals with special ized knowledge suited to perform the specific tasks for which they are trained . hut that expertise does not necessanly transfer to other domains . A master chess player cannot apply chess expertise in a game of poker(cid:151)although both chess and poker are games . a chess master who has never played poker is a nuvice poker player . Similarly , a biochemist is not qualified to per form netirostirgery , even though both biocheniists and neurosur(cid:151) geons study human physiology - In other words , the more complex a task is , the more specialized and exclusive is the knowledge recluired to perform that task . An expert perceives meaningful patterns in her domain better than non - experts . Where a novice pci(cid:146) ceives random or disconnected data points , an expert connects regular patterns within and between cases This ability to identify patterns is not an innate percepttial skill ; rather it reflects the organization of knowledge after exposure to and experience with thousands of cases . 6 2W chase and H Simon , (cid:147)Perception in chess , (cid:146) Cogiiilii(cid:146)e Psychnlngi(cid:146) . \ roi 4 , 1973 pp 55 - 81 American College uf Radiology Personal cnmmt . inicaiion , 2002 A Lesgoid , H Ruhinson , P Feliovich .

Experts comprehend the meaning of data and weigh vari ables with different criteria within their domains better than novices . Experts recognize variables that have the largest influence on a par ticular problem and locus their attention on those variables . Experts have better domain - spe cific short - term and long - term memory than novices do . (cid:148) More over , experts perform tasks in their domains faster than novices and commit fewer errors while prob 1cm solving . 9 Interestingly , experts go about solving problems differ ently than novices . Experts spend more time thinking about a prob lem to fully understand it at the beginning of a task than do nov ices , who immediately seek to find a solution . (cid:146)0 Experts use their knowledge of previous cases as context for creating mental models to solve given problems . good , or better , than an expert at making calls about the future . Better at self - monitoring than nov ices , experts are more aware of instances where they have commit ted errors or failed to understand a problem . 12 Experts check their solutions more often than novices and recognize when they are miss ing information necessary for solving a problem(cid:146)3 Experts are aware of the limits of their domain knowledge and apply their domain(cid:146)s heuristics to solve prob lems that fall outside of their experience base The Paradox of Expertise (cid:145)l(cid:146)he strengths of expertise can also he weaknesses ) (cid:146) Although one would expect experts to he good forecasters , they are not particu larly good at making predictions about the future . Since the 1930s , researchers have been testing the ability of experts to make fore casts (cid:176) The performance of experts has been tested against actuarial tables to determine if the ) (cid:146) are better at making predictions than simple statistical models . Sev enty veai(cid:146)s later , with moi(cid:146)e than two hundred experiments in differ ent domains , it is clear that the answer is no . 6 If supplied with an equal amount of data about a par ticular case , an actuarial table is as good . or better , than an expert at making cal Is a bout the fu tu c . Even if an expert is given more specific case information than is available to the statistical model , the expert does not tend to outper form the actuarial table .

UK Cambridge Un , vcrsiiy Press , 199i ) 59 Expert Teams actuarial predictions , for example , they tend to score as well as the statistical model if they use the sta tistical information in making their own predictions . (cid:145) ~ In addition , if an expert has privileged informa tion that is not reflected in the statistical table , she will actually perform hetter than the table . A classic example is the broken leg argument : Judge X has gone to the theater every Friday night for the past ten years . Based on an actuar ial table , one would predict , with some certainty , that the ludge would go to the theater this Friday night . An expert knows , however , that the judge broke her leg Thurs day afternoon and is currently in the hospital until Saturday . Know ing this key variable allows the expert to predict that the judge will not attend the theater this Friday night . Although this argument makes sense , it is misleading . Forecasting is not simply a linear logical argu ment hut rather a complex , interdisciplinary , dynamic , and mul tivariate task . Cases are rare where one key variable is known and weighed appropriately to deter mine an outcome . Generally , no single static variable predicts behavior ; rather , many dynamic variables interact , weight and value change , and other variables are introduced or omitted to determine outcome . (cid:147) Forecasting is a complex , interdisciplinary , dynamic , and multivariate task . Theorists and researchers differ when trying to explain why experts are less accurate forecasters than statistical models . Some have argued that experts . like all humans , are inconsistent when using mental models to make pre dictions . That is . the model an expert uses for predicting X in one month is different from the model used for predicting X in a follow ing month , although precisely the same case and same data set are used in both instances . ~ A number of researchers point to human biases to explain unreliable expert predictions During the last 30 years , researchers have catego rized , experimented , and theorized about the cognitive aspects of fore casting . 2(cid:176) Despite such efforts , the literature shows little consensus regarding the causes or manifesta tions of human bias Nonetheless . there is general agreement that two types of bias exist : (cid:149) Pattern bias(cid:151)looking for cvi dence that confirms rather than rejects a hypothesis and inadvert ently filling in missing data with data from prevkuis experiences . (cid:149) Heuristic bias(cid:151)using inappropri ate guidelines or rules to make predictions . The very method by which one becomes an expert explains why experts are much better at describ ing , explaining , performing tasks . and problem(cid:151)solving ~ vithin their domains than are novices , but , with a few exceptions , are worse at fore casting than actuarial tables based on historical , statistical models A given domain has specific heui(cid:146)is tics for performing tasks ~ ~ ~ incI solving problems . These rules are a large part of what makes up expertise . In addition , experts need to acquire and store tens of thousands of cases within their domains in order to recognize pat terns , generate and test hypotheses , and contribute to the collective knowledge within their fields . In other words , becoming an expert requires a significant number of years of viewing the world through the lens of one specific domain . It is the specificity that gives the expert the power to recognize pat terns , perform tasks , and solve problems . Paradoxically , it is this same speci ficity that is restrictive , narrowly focusing the experts attention on one domain to the exclusion of others . It should come as little sur prise , then . that an expert would have difficulty identifying and weighing variables in an interdisci plinary task such as forecasting an adversary(cid:146)s intentions .

Within each of these domains , a number of experts are tasked with assembling , analyzing , assigning meaning , and reporting on data , the goals being to describe . solve a problem . or make a forecast . When an expert encounters a case outside her expertise . her options are to repeat the steps she initially used to become an expert in the field . She can (cid:149) Try to make the new data fit with a pattern that she has previously stored , (cid:149) Recognize that the case falls out side her expertise and turn to her domains hetinstics to try to give meaning to the data : (cid:149) Acknowledge that the case still does not fit with her expertise and reject the data set as being an anomaly , or (cid:149) Consult with other experts . A datum , in and of itself , is not domain specific . Imagine eco nonlic data that reveal that a country is investing in technologi cal infrastructure , chemical supplies , and research and devel opment . An economist might decide that the data fit an existing spending pattern and integrate these facts with prior knowledge about a country(cid:146)s economy . The same economist might decide that this is a new pattern that needs to he remembered ( or stored in long - term memory ) for some future use . (cid:145)I(cid:146)he economist might decide that the data ate outliers of no conse quence and should he ignored . Or , the economist might decide that the The knowledge requirements for effective collaboration quickly exceed the capabilities of the individual expert . data would he meaningful to a chemist or biologist and therefore seek to collaborate with other spe cialists who might reach different conclusions regarding the data than would the economist In this example , the economist is required to use her economic exper tise in all but the final option of constilting with other experts . In the decision to collaborate , the economist is expected to know that what appears to he new economic data may have value to a chemist or biologist , domains with which she may have no experience . In other words , the economist is expected to know that an expert in sonic other field might find meaning in clara that appear to he economic . Three confounding variables affect the economist(cid:146)s dcci si onma king : (cid:149) Processing tune , or context . This does not refer to the amount of time necessary to accomplish a task , but rather the moment in time during which a task oiccurs(cid:151) . real time(cid:151)and the limi tations that come from being close to an event . (cid:145)l(cid:146)he econo mist doesn(cid:146)t have a piloit knowledge that the new data set is the critical data set for some future event . In (cid:147)real tinie . (cid:148) they are simply data to be manipu(cid:151) latecL It is only in retrospect , or long(cid:151)term memory , that the econ(cid:151) omist can fit the data into a larger pattern , weigh their value , and assign them meaning (cid:149) Pattern bias . In this particular example , the data appear to be economic and the expert is an economist . The data are , a fter all , investment data . Given the back ground and training of an economist , it makes perfect sense to try to manipulate the new data within the context of economics , despite the fact that there may he other more important angles . (cid:149) 1 - leuristic bias . The economist has spent a career becoming familiar with and using the guid ing principles of economic analysis and , at best , has only a vague familiarity with other domains and their heuristics . An economist would not necessarily know that a chemist or biologist could identify what substance is being produced based on the types of equipment and supplies that are being purchased . This example does not describe a complex problem(cid:151)most people would recognize that the data fiom this case might he of value to other domains . Iris one isolated case , viewed retrospectively , which could potentially affect two other domains . l3ut what if the econo mist had to deal with one hundred data sets per day ? Now , multiply those one hundred data sets by the number of potential domains that would be interested in any given economic cIa ta set Finally , put all of this in the context of (cid:147)real time . (cid:148) The economic expert is now expected to maintain expertise in economics , which isa full time endeavor , while simultaneously acquiring some level of experience in every other domain . Based on these expectations , the knowledge requirements for effective collabo ration quickly exceed the capabilities of the individual expert . 61 Expert Teams (cid:147) The fact that data are not shared becomes a critical The expert is left dealing with the data through the lens of her own expertise She uses her domain heuristics to met } rporate the data into an existing pattern , store the data into long(cid:151)term memory as a new pattern , or reject the data set as an outlier In each of these options , the data stop with the economist instead of heing shared with an expert in some other doiua in - The fact that these cIa ta are not shared then becomes a criti cal issue in cases of analytic error2(cid:146) In hindsight , critics will say that the implications were obvious(cid:151)that the ci(cid:146)isis could have been avoided if the data had been passed to one specific expei(cid:146)t or another . In real time(cid:146) however , an expert cannot know which particular data set would have value for an expert in another domain . The Pros and Cons of Teams One obvious solution to the para dox of expertise is to assemble an interdisciplinan(cid:146) team . Why not simply make all problem areas or country(cid:151)specific clii ta available to a team of experts from a variety of domains ? This ought , at least , to reduce the pattern and heuristic biases inherent in relying on only one domain Ignoring potential security issues , there are practical problems with this approach . First , each expert would have to sift through large 21 L K ukpatrick(cid:146) , Cap / er , / L ~ iV , fl5o , , I Li es I , (cid:151) tdIig ~ (cid:145)11cc(cid:146) & ui , , rcc ii , ii(cid:146)o , (cid:146)hi In , r / 1 t i , ond on NtacM , I ) an company , l969 ~ .

(cid:145)l(cid:146)his is not simply a Luddite reac tion to technology . Computational svstetns have had a remarkable , positive effect on processing time , storage , and retrieval , They have also demonstrated utiLity in dentify ~ ing patterns within narrowly defined antI highly constrained domains . However , intelligence analysis is neither narrowly defined nor highly constrained . Quite the opposite , it is multivariate and highly complex , which is why it requires the expertise of so many diverse fields of study Intelli gence analysis is not something a computational system handles well . While an EPSS , or some other form of computational system . may be a useful tool for ma nipti lating data , it is not a solution to the paradox of expertise . Analytic Methodologists Most domains have specialists who study the scientific process or research methods of their disci pline . These people are concerned with the epistemology of their domain , not just philosophically but practically . They want to know how experts in their discipline reach conclusions or make discos(cid:146) cries Rather than specializing in a specific substantive topic within their domain , these experts special ize in mastering the reseai(cid:146)ch and analytic methods of their domain . In the biological and medical fields , these methodological specialists ai(cid:146)e epidemiologists . In education and public policy , these specialists are program evaluators , In other fields , they are research methodologists or statisticians . Despite the label , each field recognizes that it requires experts in methodology to main tain and pass on the doimtin(cid:146)s heuristics for problem solving and making discoveries . The methodologist(cid:146)s focus is on selecting and employing a process or processes to research and ana lyze data . Specifically , the methoclologist identifies the reseai(cid:146)ch design , the methods For choosing samples , and the tools For darn analyses . This specialist becomes an in - house consultant for selecting the process by which one derives meaning from the data , icc(cid:151) ognizes patterns , and solves problems within a domain . Meth(cid:151) odologists become organizing agents within their field by focus ing on the heuristics of their domain and validating the method of discovery for their discipline . The methodologist holds a unique position within the discipline Orga nizing agents are often called on by substantive experts to advise on a variety of process issues within their field because they have a different perspective than do the experts . On any given day . an epidemiologist . for example . may be asked to con sult on studies of the effects of alcoholisoi on a community or the spread of a virus , or to review a double(cid:151)blind clinical trial of a new 64 Expert Teams pharmaceutical product . In each case , the epidemiologist is not being asked about the content of the study ; rather he is being asked to comment on the research methods and data analysis techniques used . Well over 200 analytic methods . most from domains outside intelli gence , a rca(cid:148) ailable to the intelligence analyst ; however , few methods specific to the domain of intelligence analysis exist 3(cid:176) Intelli gence analysis lacks specialists whose professional ti(cid:146)aining is in the process of employing and uni fying the analytic practices within the field of intelligence . Knowing how to apply methods , select one method over another , weigh dispar ate variables , and synthesize the results is left to the individual intel ligence analysts(cid:151)the same analysts whose expertise is confined to spe cific substantive areas and their own domains heuristics . Intelligence needs methoclologists to help strengthen the domain of analysis . Such methodologists need to specialize in the processes that the intelligence domain holds to be valid .

Few analytic methods specific to the domain of intelligence analysis exist experts in a wide variety of quanti tative and qualitative methods . In other fields ~ , the methodologists may he narrowly focused(cid:151)a laho ratory - based experimental methodologist , for example , or stat istician - In all cases , however , niethodologists can only he effec tive if they are experts at the process of making meaning ~ vithin their own disciplines In order to overcome heuristic biases , intelligence agencies need to focus personnel , resources , and training on developing intelligence methodologists . These methoclolo gists will act as in - house consultants for analytic teams , gen erate new methods specific to intelligence analysis , modify and improve existing methods of analy sis , and increase tile professionalization of the clisci pline of intelligence . Conclusion Intelligence analysis uses a wide variety of expertise to address a multivariate and complex world . Each expert uses his or her own heuristics to address a small por tion of that world . Intelligence professionals have the perception that somehow all of that disparate analysis will come together at some point , either at the analytic team level , through the reporting hierar chy , or through some computational aggregation . The intelligence analyst is affected by the same confounding variables that affect every other expert : pro cessing time , pattern bias , and heuristic bias . This is the crux of the paradox of expertise - Domain experts aie needed for describing , explaining , and problem solving ; yet , they are not especially good at forecasting because the patterns they m(cid:146)ecognize are limited to their specific fields of study . They mcvi tably look at the world through the lens of their own domain(cid:146)s heuristics . \ X(cid:146)hat is needed to overcome the paradox of expertise is a combined approach that includes formal the matic teams with structured organizational principles ; techno Logical systems designed with significant input from domain experts ; and a cadre of analytic methodologmsts . Intelligence agen cies continue to experiment with the right composition , structure , and organization of analytic teams ; they budget significant resources for technological solutions ; hut comparatively little is being done to advance methodological science . Advances in methodology are pri marily left to the individual domains - But relying on the sepa rate domains risks falling into the same paradoxical trap that cur rently exists . What is needed is an intelligence - centric approach to methodology , an approach that will include the methods and proce dures of many domains and tile development of heuristics ~ ~ ~ ii ~ ci tech niques unique to intelligence . In short , intelligence analysis needs its own analytic heuristics designed , developed , and tested by profes sional analytic methodologists . This v ~ (cid:146)ill require using methodolo gists from a variety of other domains and professional associa tions at first . hut , in time , the discipline of analytic methodology will mature into its own sub - disci pline with its own measures of validity and reliability 65
