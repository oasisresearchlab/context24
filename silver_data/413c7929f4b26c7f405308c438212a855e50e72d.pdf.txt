While the microtubules of the intercellular bridge are cut by the ESCRT - associated enzyme Spastin , the mechanism that clears F - actin at the abscission site is unknown . Here we show that oxidation - mediated depolymerization of actin by the redox enzyme MICAL1 is key for ESCRT - III recruitment and successful abscission . MICAL1 is recruited to the abscission site by the Rab35 GTPase through a direct interaction with a ﬂat three - helix domain found in MICAL1 C terminus . Mechanistically , in vitro assays on single actin ﬁlaments demonstrate that MICAL1 is activated by Rab35 . Moreover , in our experimental conditions , MICAL1 does not act as a severing enzyme , as initially thought , but instead induces F - actin depolymerization from both ends . Our work reveals an unexpected role for oxidoreduction in triggering local actin depolymerization to control a fundamental step of cell division .

While cytokinesis is essential for cell proliferation , an important proportion of cancers likely result from a cytokinesis failure 1 , 2 . Cytokinesis starts in anaphase with large - scale deformation of the plasma membrane driven by a contractile ring made of actin and myosin II ( ref . 3 ) . This ring cannot lead to cell cleavage on its own , since for several hours the two daughter cells are connected by a microtubule - ﬁlled intercellular bridge , both in cultured cells and in vivo 4 . At the center of the bridge , the midbody or Flemming body serves as a platform for abscission . A major advance in the cell division ﬁeld came from recognition that the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport ( ESCRT ) , initially described for intraluminal vesicle formation in late endosomes and HIV budding , forms helices that locally pinch the plasma membrane and drive abscission 5 – 9 . Consistent with its key role in abscission , the ESCRT machinery is the target of the AuroraB - dependent NoCut checkpoint 9 – 12 . While F - actin and microtubules play pivotal roles in furrow ingression , these cytoskeleton elements must be cleared at the abscission site to allow constriction of the plasma membrane by the ESCRT machinery 3 , 4 . An important conceptual advance came upon discovery that the microtubule - depolymerizing enzyme Spastin is recruited by the ESCRT machinery in order to clear microtubules at the abscission site 13 , 14 . With respect to actin clearance , the small GTPases Rab35 and Rab11A function in parallel to prevent F - actin accumulation within the intercellular bridge 15 , 16 . Indeed , Rab35 recruits the Oculo - Cerebro - Renal syndrome of Lowe ( OCRL ) phosphatase to the intercellular bridge to locally hydrolyse PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , a lipid that pro - motes actin polymerization in late cytokinetic bridges 17 – 19 . Similarly , Rab11A - endosomes transport p50RhoGAP that limits actin polymerization 20 . However , the mechanisms that actively depolymerize F - actin in the intercellular bridge , equivalent to Spastin for microtubules , remain to be discovered . MICAL1 , identiﬁed as a Molecule Interacting with CasL , belongs to the family of MICAL proteins , conserved from insects to humans 21 . MICALs are intracellular proteins that catalyse oxidation – reduction ( redox ) reactions through their ﬂavoprotein monooxygenase ( MO ) domain and use F - actin as a subst - rate 22 – 25 . These enzymes bind ﬂavin adenine dinucleotide ( FAD ) 26 , 27 and use the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NADPH ) and O 2 in redox reactions , causing disassembly of F - actin likely by directly oxidizing speciﬁc actin methionines . Mechanistically , it was initially proposed that MICALs constitute a new family of actin severing enzymes 23 and a recent report indicates that MICAL - oxidized ﬁlaments are more efﬁciently severed by coﬁlin 28 . In Drosophila , MICAL - mediated actin remodelling regulates axon guidance and has esse - ntial roles in other actin - related processes such as myoﬁlament organization , dendritic pruning and bristle development 22 , 29 – 31 . In Man , three MICAL genes ( MICAL1 , - 2 and - 3 ) have been identiﬁed and are required for fundamental biological processes , such as cell adhesion , cell migration , axon growth , angiogenesis , gene transcription and vesicle trafﬁcking 25 , 32 – 36 . Despite the importance of MICALs in F - actin dynamics , nothing is known about their potential roles during cell division . Importantly , MICALs’ enzymatic activity must be tightly regulated . For understanding how they locally remodel the actin cytoskeleton , a crucial question is to determine how these enzymes are activated and precisely targeted at speciﬁc cellular locations . Given that Rab35 controls actin dynamics in many cellular functions including cytokinesis 16 and that Rab35 interacts with MICAL1 by two - hybrid and co - immunoprecipitation ( coIP ) 36 , 37 , it has been hypothesized that Rab35 together with MICAL1 might regulate cytokinesis 38 . Here we provide evidence for a conserved and fundamental role of MICAL1 in cytokinetic abscission , both in human and Drosophila cells . Active , GTP - bound Rab35 directly interacts with the tail of MICAL1 through a ﬂat three - helix domain revealed by X - ray crystallography . This interaction is essential for localizing MICAL1 at the abscission site . Surprisingly , single ﬁlament assays using end or side - bound tethers demonstrate that the MICAL1 - induced weakening of F - actin primarily induces rapid depoly - merization from both ends rather than ﬁlament severing previ - ously reported for both tethered 23 and unteathered 28 ﬁlaments . Importantly , we reveal that Rab35 activates the enzymatic activity of MICAL1 by displacing the inhibitory intramolecular interaction between the C - terminus of MICAL and its catalytic monooxygenase domain . Altogether , MICAL1 controls abscission by promoting F - actin depolymerization at the abscission site , which appears as a prerequisite for ESCRT recruitment at this location . Altogether , this work links oxidation with local cytoskeleton depolymerization , revealing an unexpected role for oxidoreduction in cell division . Results MICAL1 localizes at the abscission site . During cell division , immunoﬂuorescence on ﬁxed samples revealed that cells expressing GFP - MICAL1 displayed cytoplasmic staining during prophase , metaphase and furrow ingression , but showed a distinct pattern during late cytokinetic stages ( Fig . 1a ; Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . Using b - tubulin and the ESCRT - III component CHMP4B as markers for the age of the intercellular bridges 7 , 8 , MICAL1 was ﬁrst found to accumulate on both sides of the midbody , where it colocalized with CHMP4B ( Fig . 1a , red arrows point to midbodies ) . Of note , MICAL1 was not present at earlier stages , when CHMP4B was not yet present in the bridge ( 0 out of 57 bridges ) . Interestingly , while CHMP4B localization changes from the midbody to the adjacent abscission site , chara - cterized by an interruption of the tubulin staining ( secondary ingression site 7 , 8 , 20 ) , MICAL1 localization shifted from the midbody to a zone closely apposed to or at the abscission site ( Fig . 1b , orange arrows point to abscission sites ) , where it partially colocalized with CHPM4B . Quantiﬁcation revealed that 62 % of the bridges ( n ¼ 84 ) displaying CHMP4B at the abscission site showed a detectable pool of MICAL1 apposed or at this location . The same results were obtained in CRISPR / Cas9 - mediated genome - edited HeLa cell line that expressed MICAL1 tagged with GFP ( GFP - MICAL1 endogenous ) at the endogenous locus , ruling out overexpression artifacts ( Fig . 1c ; Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . Time - lapse ﬂuorescent and phase - contrast microscopy further indicated that GFP - MICAL1 endogenous is ﬁrst recruited to the midbody , then accumulates transiently at the abscission site before abscission occurs ( Fig . 1d ) . This suggests that MICAL1 might play a role during cytokinesis when ESCRT - III localization shifts from the midbody to the abscission site and before ESCRT - III - dependent helices constrict to completion . We conclude that MICAL1 dynamically localizes to the intercellular bridge and overlaps with CHMP4B at the abscission site before cytokinetic abscission . MICAL1 is required for successful cytokinetic abscission . To test whether MICAL1 has a role in cytokinetic abscission , HeLa cells were recorded for 48 h using phase contrast time - lapse microscopy to determine with a 10 min accuracy the timing of abscission in control versus MICAL1 - depleted cells . Treatment with siRNA targeting MICAL1 led to at least a 90 % reduction of endogenous MICAL1 protein levels ( Fig . 2a ) . In control - and MICAL1 - depleted cells , mitotic round up , furrow ingression and formation of the intercellular bridge occurred normally ( Fig . 2b ) .

In particular , 20 % of the MICAL1 - depleted cells completed abscission 4 8 . 5 h after bridge formation , as compared to 3 . 5 % in control cells . In addi - tion , abscission was entirely blocked in 4 . 1 % of divisions after MICAL1 depletion ( more than threefold increase as compared to controls ) , and sister cells separate only mechanically by forces produced during rounding up in the following mitosis ( Supplementary Fig . 1c ) . Importantly , the abscission defects observed in MICAL1 - depleted cells were completely rescued by the re - expression of a siRNA - resistant mRNA encoding GFP - tagged MICAL1 , excluding off - target artifacts ( Fig . 2d ) . Inter - estingly , expression of a redox - dead mutant of MICAL1 that is unable to oxidize F - actin ( G90W - G92W - G95W , hereafter MICAL1 3G3W ) 29 had a dominant negative effect and further delayed abscission ( Fig . 2e ) , while it localized properly to the bridge ( Supplementary Fig . 1d ) . a d c GFP - MICAL1 endogenous GFP - MICAL1 endogenous Aurora B GFP - MICAL1 endogenous G F P - M I C A L1 endogenou s GFP - MICAL1 endogenous La t e b r i dge w i t hou t s e c onda r y i ng r e ss i on La t e b r i dge w i t h s e c onda r y i ng r e ss i on La t e b r i dge w i t h s e c onda r y i ng r e ss i o n GFP - MICAL1 CHMP4B β - tubulin GFP - MICAL1 GFP - MICAL1 GFP - MICAL1 CHMP4B β - tubulin T R A N S 70 min 90 min 110 min 155 min 195 min 190 min GFP - MICAL1 β - Tubulin CHMP4B GFP - MICAL1 β - Tubulin CHMP4B La t e b r i dge w i t hou t s e c onda r y i ng r e ss i o n Aurora B Midbodyremnant Abscission GFP - MICAL1 Aurora B GFP - MICAL1 Aurora B Z oo m Z oo m Z oo m Z oo m Z oo m Z oo m b Figure 1 | MICAL1 localizes in late intercellular bridges at the abscission site .

To determine whether the function of MICAL in cytokinesis is evolutionarily conserved , we recorded Drosophila S2 cells upon dMICAL depletion using double - strand RNAs 39 . The timing of cytokinetic abscission was determined using Anillin - mCherry as a marker of the midbody , as previously described 40 . As in human cells , abscission was delayed in dMICAL - depleted cells indicating that MICAL is required for normal abscission in different species ( Supplementary Fig . 1e ) . These results reveal a conserved function of MICAL1 in cytokinesis and indicate that the redox enzymatic activity of MICAL1 is required for successful abscission . MICAL1 depletion leads to F - actin accumulation in bridges . For fusion of the plasma membrane and ﬁnal cut , all cytoskeletal elements , in particular F - actin , must be cleared at the abscission site 4 . Because MICALs have been shown to directly bind and disassemble actin ﬁlaments , we hypothesized that MICAL1 depletion might modify F - actin amounts at the intercellular bridge and thus impair cytokinetic abscission . Using ﬂuorescent phalloidin as a marker for F - actin or a cell line expressing GFP - actin at endogenous levels , F - actin levels were found abnormally elevated in late intercellular bridges upon MICAL1 depletion ( Fig . 3a ; Supplementary Fig . 1f ) . Interestingly , this striking F - actin accumulation occurred at intercellular bridges rather than on cell bodies , suggesting a local action of MICAL1 during cytokinesis . 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 0 500 1 , 000 1 , 500 2 , 000 2 , 500 3 , 000 0 500 1 , 000 1 , 500 2 , 000 Control siRNA + GFP MICAL1 siRNA + GFP a 100 % Control siRNA MICAL1 siRNA ControlsiRNA MICAL1siRNA ControlsiRNA + GFP ControlsiRNA + GFP MICAL1 WT MICAL1siRNA + GFP MICAL1siRNA + GFP MICAL1 WT ControlsiRNA + GFP MICAL1siRNA + GFP ControlsiRNA + GFP MICAL1 3G3W MICAL1 β - tubulin b c e d C on t r o l s i RN A Furrow Ingression Intercellular bridge Abscissioncompleted 0 min 110 min 210 min 250 min 260 min A b sc i ss i on t i m e ( m i n ) C u m u l a t i v e pe r c en t ag e o f c e ll s t ha t c o m p l e t ed ab sc i s i on Time after furrow ingression ( min ) Time after furrow ingression ( min ) Time after furrow ingression ( min ) C u m u l a t i v e pe r c en t age o f c e ll s t ha t c o m p l e t ed ab s c i s i on A b sc i ss i on t i m e ( m i n ) C u m u l a t i v e pe r c en t age o f c e ll s t ha t c o m p l e t ed ab sc i s i on A b sc i ss i on t i m e ( m i n ) M I C A L1 s i RN A Furrow ingression Intercellular bridge Abscissioncompleted ControlsiRNA MICAL1siRNA 50 % 25 % 12 . 5 % 100 % 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 Loading Control siRNA + GFP - MICAL1 3G3W 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 100 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 0 100 200 300 400 500 0 * * * NS * * NS * 0 500 1 , 000 1 , 500 2 , 000 Control siRNA + GFP Control siRNA + GFP – MICAL1 WT MICAL1 siRNA + GFP – MICAL1 WT MICAL1 siRNA + GFP 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 0 min 160 min 280 min 660 min 900 min 190 kDa 115 kDa 50 kDa Figure 2 | MICAL1 is required for successful cytokinetic abscission .

In control cells expressing GFP - actin at endogenous levels , GFP - actin staining was close to background levels by ﬂuorescent microscopy and the corresponding membrane of the bridge appeared smooth by SEM ( Fig . 3b , left ) . In contrast , GFP - actin levels were strongly and locally increased in the intercellular bridge in MICAL1 - depleted cells , as expected ( Fig . 3b , right ) .

Membrane bulges and extensions were occasionally seen at the plasma membrane of the cell body , further indicating a locally restricted role of MICAL1 at the division site . To directly investigate whether abnormal F - actin accumulation observed in MICAL1 - depleted cells was the cause of the cytokinesis defects , cells were treated with very low , non - toxic amounts ( 20 nM ) of the F - actin depolymerizing drug Latruncu - lin - A ( LatA ) . We conﬁrmed that the addition of 20 nM of LatA did not modify the levels of F - actin in control bridges ( Fig . 3c , controls ) and furthermore did not perturb cytokinetic abscission ( Fig . 3d , controls ) . Interestingly , depolymerization induced by LatA treatment almost completely restored normal amounts of F - actin in intercellular bridges of MICAL1 - depleted cells ( Fig . 3c ) . This indicates that the extra amount of F - actin in these bridges is particularly sensitive to low doses of actin - depolymerizing drugs . Importantly , abscission defects associated with MICAL1 deple - tion were almost completely corrected by LatA treatment ( Fig . 3d ) . Altogether , these results demonstrate that F - actin accumula - tion in MICAL1 - depleted cells is responsible for the observed defects in cytokinetic abscission . F - actin accumulation impairs CHMP4B recruitment . Since F - actin accumulation inhibits cytokinetic abscission in MICAL1 - depleted cells , we investigated whether ESCRT - III localization was defective . The ESCRT - III protein CHMP4B was present in B 85 % of the cytokinetic bridges ( either at the midbody only or at the midbody þ the abscission site ) , both in control - and in MICAL1 - depleted cells ( Fig . 3e ) . However , CHMP4B was cor - rectly recruited at the abscission site in only 23 % of the bridges in MICAL1 - depleted cells , in contrast to 39 % in control cells ( Fig . 3e ) . Concomitantly , an increase of bridges with CHMP4B localized only at the midbody was observed after MICAL1 depletion ( Fig . 3e ) . Altogether , these results suggest that clearing F - actin from the bridge does not perturb initial ESCRT - III recruitment at the midbody but its subsequent recruitment at the abscission site . To test whether F - actin accumulation underpinned defects in ESCRT - III localization , we treated control - and MICAL1 - depleted cells with 20 nM of LatA . In line with the restoration of normal F - actin levels and normal abscission ( Fig . 3c , d ) , the proportion of bridges with normal CHPM4B recruitment at the abscission site was partially , but signiﬁcantly rescued by LatA treatment ( Fig . 3f ) . These results mechanistically explain why normal abscission was observed after LatA treatment in MICAL1 - depleted cells ( Fig . 3d ) . We thus conclude that the change in localization of ESCRT - III from the midbody to the abscission site critically depends on MICAL1 and requires a reduction of F - actin levels in the intercellular bridge . GTP - bound Rab35 directly interacts with MICAL1 . We next investigated by which mechanism MICAL1 is recruited to the abscission site during cytokinesis . Consistent with previous reports indicating potential direct interactions between MICALs and several Rab GTPases , including Rab35 ( refs 36 , 37 ) , we isolated clones encoding the C - terminal tail of MICAL1 ( Fig . 4a ) when we conducted a yeast 2 - hybrid screen using the human GTP - locked mutant Rab35 Q67L as bait and a human placenta complementary DNA ( cDNA ) library . Interestingly , Rab35 is an established regulator of actin remodelling during cytokinesis , both in Drosophila and human cells 16 , 17 , 43 . Yeast 2 - hybrid experiments using truncated mutants of the C - terminal tail indicated that amino acids ( aa ) 879 – 1067 ( MICAL1 879 – 1067 ) and aa 918 – 1067 ( MICAL1 918 – 1067 ) interacted with GTP - bound Rab35 Q67L and wild - type Rab35 , but failed to interact with the GDP - bound Rab35 S22N mutant ( Fig . 4b ; Supplementary Fig . 1g ) . Next , using recombinant proteins , the interaction between Rab35 and MICAL1 879 – 1067 was demonstrated to be direct and GTP - speciﬁc ( Fig . 4c ) . This was conﬁrmed by isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) , which determined that MICAL1 879 – 1067 and MICAL1 918 – 1067 fragments bound active , GppNHp - loaded form of Rab35 with comparable afﬁnities ( K d ¼ 13 and 6 . 4 m M , respectively ) , whereas no measurable binding was found with GDP - Rab35 ( Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . We also determined that the last 26 aa of Rab35 were not necessary for the interaction ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Finally , endogenous MICAL1 was preferentially immunoprecipitated by Flag - tagged GTP - bound mutant Rab35 Q67L ( Fig . 4d ) , suggesting that MICAL1 is a bona ﬁde effector of Rab35 . As expected if Rab35 and MICAL1 function together , mCherry - MICAL1 colocalized in the intercellular bridge with GFP - Rab35 endogenous ( Rab35 tagged at the endogenous locus in TALEN - edited cells 19 ) , both on the lateral parts of the midbody and later at the abscission site ( Fig . 4e ) . When cells expressed the dominant negative Rab35 S22N mutant to inhibit Rab35 activation 43 , 44 , a decrease in the number of bridges displaying detectable levels of MICAL1 was observed ( Fig . 4f ) . This is consistent with MICAL1 being an effector of Rab35 during cytokinesis , and indicates that active , GTP - bound Rab35 contributes to MICAL1 recruitment to the abscission site . In order to ﬁnd a mutant of MICAL1 that has lost its ability to interact with Rab35 , we screened deletion mutants in the MICAL1 C - terminal tail by two - hybrid assays . Whereas the C - terminal tail of MICAL1 ( MICAL1 879 – 1067 ) interacted with Figure 3 | MICAL1 depletion leads to F - actin accumulation in cytokinetic bridges associated with abnormal CHMP4B recruitment and abscission defects .

We conclude that the Rab - binding domain is crucial for MICAL1 recruitment to the abscission site and for MICAL1 function during cytokinesis . The tail of MICAL1 adopts a ﬂat three - helix domain . The interaction with Rab35 required the last 150 residues of MICAL1 ( aa 918 – 1067 ) , in which the last 41 residues are essential ( Fig . 4c , g ) . The C - terminal region of MICAL1 has been described as comprising segments of coiled - coils 21 , 37 , potentially implying oligomerization of this enzyme 21 , 37 . We determined a structure of this domain by X - ray crystallography at 3 . 3 Å resolution ( Fig . 5a ; Supplementary Fig . 3a ; Supplementary Table 2 ) . Surprisingly , the structure consists of a curved sheet of three helices 45 , exposing two opposite ﬂat surfaces ( Fig . 5a ) , which differs from most three helices folds that usually form compact bundles ( Supplementary Fig . 3b ) . This structure is formed by anti - parallel intramolecular coiled - coils interactions : while the ﬁrst part of helix H2 makes coiled - coil interactions with helix H1 , the second part of helix H2 interacts with helix H3 also with coiled - coil interactions , and no interactions are formed between the H1 and H3 helices ( Fig . 5a , Supplementary Fig . 3b ) . Biophysical measurements by MALS and SAXS indicated that this domain is a monomer ( Supplementary Figs 4 and 5 ) , and thus does not form an elongated dimeric coiled - coil , as previously found for other Rab - effectors 46 , 47 . The residues stabilizing inter - helical interactions are conserved for MICAL family members ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) , except MICAL2 that does not possess this C - terminal domain . Actually , the C - terminal domain fold is conserved for other members of the MICAL family , as it has been recently demonstrated for MICAL - cL , MICAL1 and MICAL3 ( ref . 48 ) . In fact , our structure superimpose with each of these structures with root - mean - square deviation ( r . m . s . d . ) of 1 . 1 Å for 101 residues . Overall , the domain of B 80 (cid:3) 30 Å in dimension exposes two large curved surfaces on either side of the helices ( Fig . 5a ) . To deﬁne how Rab35 could bind to MICAL1 , we generated two different series of mutations ( S1 and S2 ) by selecting exposed and conserved surface residues on opposite surfaces of the three - helix sheet ( Fig . 5a ; Supplementary Fig . 4 : yellow residues for mutant S1 ( E946K , V950D , E953K , V971E , L975R and V978E ) and orange residues for mutant S2 ( R1012E , M1015R , L1034K and V1038E ) ) . We characterized their ability to bind to Rab35 by yeast 2 - hybrid assays ( Supplementary Fig . 6a – c ) and ITC ( Supplementary Table 1 ; Supplementary Fig . 2 ) , and we demonstrated by SAXS their ability to conserve the native fold despite the mutations ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . These mutants allowed us to delineate the surface responsible for Rab35 binding since both WT and the mutant S1 were able to bind Rab35 with similar afﬁnity and a stoichiometry of 1 : 1 , while the mutant S2 had lost all ability to bind Rab35 ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . The mutant S2 ( R1012E , M1015R , L1034K and V1038E ) and the single mutant M1015R had very low binding afﬁnity to Rab35 indicating that both H2 and H3 helices participate in Rab35 binding ( Supplementary Table 1 ; Supplementary Fig . 6a – c ) , while the opposite face of the three helical domain deﬁned by the S1 mutations do not participate in Rab35 binding . To further delineate this Rab - binding interface , we probed the region found at the opposite end of the H3 helix with two single mutations I1048R and R1055E ( Fig . 5a ; Supplementary Fig . 4 , red residues ) . While Rab35 binding was abolished for R1055E and signiﬁcantly reduced for I1048R ( Supplementary Table 1 ; Supplementary Fig . 6a – c ) , the E1001R mutation on the other side of this surface ( Fig . 5b , c ) showed that this conserved helix H2 residue is not essential for Rab35 binding by 2 - hybrid assays ( Supplementary Fig . 6c ) . The surface surrounding the critical Rab35 binding residues ( Fig . 5b ) is in large part composed of exposed hydrophobic residues surrounded by charged residues ( Fig . 5c ) . Most of these residues are conserved among MICAL proteins ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) , consistent with Rab - binding properties of several MICAL family members 37 , 49 and with the crystal structure of Rab1 bound to MICAL - cL 48 . This Rab35 - binding surface ( oval in Fig . 5c ) explains why the D 41 fragment ( aa 918 – 1026 ) , which lacks the whole H3 helix , is unable to bind Rab35 ( see above ) . Consistent with helices H2 and H3 but not H1 being crucial for Rab35 binding , introduction of the single mutations M1015R , I1048R or R1055E in full - length MICAL1 prevented MICAL1 localization to cytokinetic bridges ( Fig . 5d ) , while mutant S1 still localized properly ( Supplementary Fig . 6d ) . In conclusion , we identiﬁed key residues involved in Rab35 binding and thus required for MICAL1 localization during cytokinesis . Rab35 activates the enzymatic activity of MICAL1 . Several experiments demonstrated that the catalytic monooxygenase / FAD domain of MICAL1 ( MICAL1 1 – 499 or ‘FAD’ hereafter , Fig . 4a ) disassembles actin ﬁlament in vitro using bulk assays , but how MICAL induces oxidation - mediated actin disassembly remains poorly understood 23 , 24 . Since the puriﬁed catalytic domain of Drosophila MICAL was reported to fragment indi - vidual actin ﬁlaments attached to a coverslip , MICAL1 has been proposed as a novel F - actin severing enzyme 23 . We reinvestigated in more detail the mechanism of actin disassembly by human MICAL1 using microﬂuidics , where the ﬁlaments are anchored by their stabilized pointed end only , while the dynamics of their free sides and free barbed end can be monitored accurately 50 ( Fig . 6a ) . The introduction of MICAL1 FAD domain dramatically increased the depolymerization rate of actin ﬁlaments in a NADPH - dependent manner ( Fig . 6b ) . Quantiﬁcations revealed that the barbed end depolymerized at a rate of up to 50 actin Figure 4 | GTP - bound Rab35 directly interacts with MICAL1 and contributes to its localization at the intercellular bridge .

The rate of F - actin depolymerization increased over time and reached a plateau B 150 s after exposure to FAD ( Fig . 6b ) . Interestingly , rapid depolymerization continued after removal of FAD from the microﬂuidic chamber ( Fig . 6c , left ) , showing that oxidized actin ﬁlaments depolymerize faster regardless of the presence of MICAL1 in solution . To further consolidate this observation , actin ﬁlaments were exposed to FAD in the presence of NADPH , the enzyme was removed from the microﬂuidic chamber and re - polymerization of the same ﬁlaments with fresh , non - oxidized actin monomers was achieved . After removal of actin monomers , ﬁlaments slowly depolymerized until the barbed end reached the oxidized lattice , where it started to quickly depolymerize even though FAD was absent from the solution ( Fig . 6c , right ) .

Unexpectedly , we did not detect any increase in fragmentation events when exposing ﬁlaments to FAD in our microﬂuidics experiments . This result contrasts with a previous report , where ﬁlaments were anchored to the coverslip by inactivated myosins and observed with Total Internal Reﬂection Fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy 23 .

We conclude that MICAL1 destabilizes the whole ﬁlament lattice and accelerates its depolymerization from the barbed ends , instead of severing actin ﬁlaments . Notably , we also observed that FAD enhanced pointed end depolymerization , in both setups . We quantiﬁed the pointed end dynamics of ﬁlaments anchored to the surface by their barbed ends in our microﬂuidics set - up , and found that FAD increased pointed end depolymerization more than eightfold as well , from 0 . 17 ± 0 . 07 subunits per s in controls to 1 . 44 ± 0 . 34 subunits per s ( s . d . , N ¼ 25 ﬁlaments ) . Altogether , we conclude that MICAL1 - induced oxidation weakens subunit interactions within the actin ﬁlament , which enhances depolymerization from both ends . One key question regarding this new family of actin - depolymerizing enzymes is how they are activated at the right place and time . Several studies demonstrated that the full - length protein is catalytically inactive and that the C - terminal extremity somehow inhibits enzyme activity 33 , 51 . Indeed , overexpression of MICAL1 does not disassemble the cellular actin cytoskeleton , unless the C - terminal extremity is truncated or mutated . We ﬁrst determined using recombinant proteins that MICAL1 1 – 843 ( hereafter ‘FAD - CH - LIM’ , see Fig . 4a ) directly interacted with the last C - terminal third of the protein MICAL 879 – 1067 ( Fig . 6e ) , consistent with an intramolecular folded conformation for MICAL1 . Demonstrating that the folding is inhibitory , incubation with increasing amounts of MICAL 879 – 1067 progre - ssively inhibited the depolymerizing activity of FAD - CH - LIM ( Supplementary Fig . 7a , b ) . Remarkably , the addition of Rab35 loaded with GTP displaced the interaction between the C - terminal domain and FAD - CH - LIM , suggesting that binding of Rab35 regulates enzyme activity ( Fig . 6e ) . Conﬁrming this hypothesis the depolymerizing activity of full - length MICAL1 was greatly enhanced in the presence of active Rab35 , reaching the same depolymerization rates as when ﬁlaments were exposed to the non - inhibited FAD domain ( Fig . 6f , g ) . These results demonstrate that MICAL1 - dependent actin oxidation induces depolymerization of F - actin ﬁlaments from both ends . In addition , Rab35 binding to MICAL1 fully releases the inhibitory interaction between the enzymatic and the C - terminal domains . This provides an original mechanism of activation of MICAL proteins by Rab GTPases . Discussion Successful abscission requires that all cytoskeletal elements are removed from the abscission site to allow ESCRT - III helices to pinch the plasma membrane between the two daughter cells . While microtubules are depolymerized by the ESCRT - associated enzyme Spastin , the equivalent machinery that depolymerizes F - actin remains elusive . Here we identiﬁed MICAL1 as a critical enzyme localized in late cytokinetic bridges that promotes F - actin clearance at the abscission site ( Fig . 7 ) . In the absence of MICAL1 , F - actin accumulates in intracellular bridges , ESCRT - III components do not localize to the abscission site properly and cytokinetic abscission is delayed . The delay is even increased when a catalytically dead mutant MICAL1 3G3W is expressed , highlighting the critical role of MICAL1 in abscission by controlling actin depolymerization through oxidoreduction . Importantly , we found that MICAL1 plays an evolutionarily conserved role in abscission from Drosophila to human cells . Intriguingly , the MICAL family members MICAL - L1 ( MICAL - like 1 ) and MICAL3 also play a role in cell division 52 , 53 . However , this must be by a different mechanism , since MICAL3 functions in cytokinesis independently from its redox domain and MICAL - L1 lacks this enzymatic domain . Actually both MICAL - L1 and MICAL3 function in cell division by acting as scaffold proteins interacting with Rab11 - and Rab8A - positive vesicles . Thus , MICAL - L1 and MICAL3 ( through membrane trafﬁ - cking ) 49 , 52 – 54 as well as MICAL1 ( through F - actin depolymeri - zation , this study ) , play critical yet distinct roles in cytokinesis . Our results reveal a new important mechanism that controls the timing of abscission , since they demonstrate that actin depolymerization is a prerequisite for proper ESCRT - III localiza - tion at the abscission site , but not earlier at the midbody / Flemming body ( Fig . 7 ) . Interestingly , Jasplakinolide treatment reduced ESCRT - III recruitment to the abscission site ( Supplementary Fig . 8a ) , suggesting that chemical stabilization of actin also perturbs the recruitment of the abscission machinery . One possibility is that local actin depolymerization at , or close to the future abscission site regulates membrane tension within the intercellular bridge , which has been proposed to drive the translocation of ESCRT - III components from the Flemming body to the abscission site 55 . Alternatively , F - actin might represent a physical barrier that does not permit the recruitment of ESCRT - III at the abscission site 4 . Interestingly , the presence of the Arp2 / 3 subunit p34 Arc in MICAL1 - depleted bridges ( Supplementary Fig . 8b ) suggests that branched actin networks actually accumulate in these bridges . Of note , the fact that B 50 % of the cells undergo abscission with normal timing after MICAL1 depletion suggest that additional mechanisms exist in order to clear actin from cytokinetic bridges . For instance , Rab35 together with the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 phosphatase OCRL and Rab11 together with p50RhoGAP both limit actin polymerization in cytokinetic bridges 17 , 20 , and could act in a redundant manner with MICAL1 . Altogether , Rab35 controls F - actin levels during abscission by both limiting actin polymerization through OCRL and actively promoting its depolymerization through MICAL1 . How MICAL1 localization is determined in cells was poorly understood . Here we identiﬁed a tight functional link between MICAL1 and the Rab35 GTPase during cytokinesis .

NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms14528 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 8 : 14528 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms14528 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 11 Mechanistically , we demonstrate that GTP - bound Rab35 directly interacts with the C - terminal domain of MICAL1 and that Rab35 contributes to MICAL1 recruitment to the abscission site . Members of the MICAL and MICAL - like families have been reported to interact via a predicted coiled - coil domain with various Rab GTPases 21 , 37 , 49 , 54 , reminiscent of other Rab / coiled - coil domain interactions with parallel dimeric coiled - coil proteins 46 , 47 . However , the structure of the Rab binding domain ( RBD ) of MICAL1 that we determined and several structures recently determined for Rab / RBD complexes 48 show that the nature of the interactions between MICALs and Rab proteins are quite different , since the Rab - interacting domain of MICAL1 folds into a structural domain composed of a sheet of three anti - parallel helices 45 . Based on single - mutant analysis , we predict that the H2 and H3 helices are critical for Rab35 binding . Two potential Rab binding sites of MICAL proteins have recently been identiﬁed with the structure of the MICAL1 RBD bound to two Rab10 molecules ( 5LPN ) 48 . In light of this study , our mutational analysis indicate that Rab35 binds to only one of the two Rab binding sites described for MICAL1 RBD , as does Rab1 ( ref . 48 ) . Consistently , only the Rab binding site involving the H2 and H3 helices plays a role for MICAL1 recruitment to the bridge . An unexpected result is the ﬁnding that , in our experiments under different conditions , MICAL1 is not an F - actin severing enzyme , as initially thought 23 , and that its primary effect is to enhance ﬁlament depolymerization from both ends . We conﬁ - rmed our observations using Drosophila MICAL ( Supplementary Fig . 7c , d ) , and veriﬁed that MICAL is not altering actin dynamics through H 2 O 2 production ( Supplementary Fig . 7e ) , as previously reported 23 . Enhanced depolymerization is consistent with the notion that MICAL1 oxidation weakens longitudinal interactions between F - actin subunits . We expect this weakening to make ﬁlaments more sensitive to fragmentation - inducing conditions , and thus believe that the initially observed severing 23 was provoked by ﬁlament - surface interactions , different degree of bending , high ﬂuorescent labelling fractions and / or illumination conditions . In fact , MICAL - oxidized ﬁlaments were recently reported to be more easily fragmented by mechanical stress and by the severing activity of coﬁlin 28 . This result also suggests that coﬁlin could contribute to removing F - actin from the abscission site in response to MICAL activation . Its high depolymerizing activity implies that MICAL1 must be tightly regulated both in space and time . In vitro , the catalytic activity of MICAL1 monooxygenase domain 26 , 27 is modulated by its non - catalytic CH , LIM and C - terminal domains ( refs 24 , 56 and see below ) . Importantly , it has been reported that MICAL and MICAL - like family members exist in an auto - inhibited , folded conformation 33 , 51 . Although MICAL - L1 lacks the mono - oxygenase domain , an intra - molecular interaction can be displaced when Rab13 is overexpressed in cells 57 , but its functional relevance remains elusive . Previous studies reporting dMICAL roles in axon guidance in Drosophila revealed that the C - terminal part of the protein interacts with the semaphorin receptor PlexinA , which has been proposed to induce enzyme activity 29 , 51 . How MICAL is activated outside neurons is , however , poorly understood , and control of cytokinetic abscission by extracellular ligands such as semaphorin seems unlikely . We found using recombinant proteins that MICAL monooxygenase / FAD - CH - LIM domain directly interacts with the C - terminal half of the protein . The folded conformation of full - length MICAL1 displays low enzymatic activity in single actin ﬁlament assays presented here , bulk assays 22 – 24 , or when overexpressed in interphase cells 33 . Remarkably , the presence of GTP - Rab35 is able to displace the intramolecular interaction and fully release inhibition of the enzyme . Altogether , we propose that MICAL1 binding to Rab35 not only localizes MICAL1 in late cytokinetic bridges , but also activates monooxygenase activity . Oxidoreduction is one of the most fundamental processes in living organisms and plays a pivotal role in metabolic reactions . In a disease perspective , oxidative stress generates ROS that contributes to aging by oxidizing proteins , nucleic acids and lipids in a non - speciﬁc manner 58 . In contrast , this study highlights the critical role of controlled actin oxidation in cytoskeleton dynamics and reveals an unexpected role of oxidoreduction in cell division .

A yeast two - hybrid experiments were performed by co - transforming the Saccharomyces cerevisiae reporter strain L40 with either pGAD - MICAL1 879 - 1026 , pGAD - MICAL1 879 – 1067 , pGAD - MICAL1 918 – 1067 , as well as , MICAL1 879 – 1067 mutants S1 ( E946K , V950D , E953K , V971E , L975R , E978R ) , S2 ( R1012E , M1015R , L1034K , V1038E ) , S3 ( E1101R , V1038E , V1041E , I1048R , R1055E ) and MICAL1 879 – 1067 single mutants M1015R , I1048R and R1055E , together with either pLex - human Rab35 WT , pLex - human Rab35 Q67L , pLex - human Rab35 S22N .

By convention , * P o 0 . 05 ; * * P o 0 . 01 and * * * P o 0 . 001 . Single ﬁlament experiments . Actin was puriﬁed from rabbit muscle acetone powder and labelled with Alexa 488 . In microﬂuidics experiments , ﬁlaments were aged for 15min with 0 . 12 m M actin to become fully ADP - actin , prior to depoly - merization 50 . In surface - anchored experiments , steady - state ﬁlaments were anchored and exposed to depolymerization conditions B 120s before observation 23 . Images were acquired in epiﬂuorescence or TIRF microscopy , and were analysed using Image J and homemade Python software . Proteins and buffers . Actin was puriﬁed from rabbit muscle acetone powder ( Pel - freez ) using the following protocol 61 : the powder was resuspended in G - buffer ( 5mM TRIS pH 7 . 8 , 0 . 2mM ATP , 0 . 1mM CaCl 2 , 1mM DTT and 0 . 01 % NaN 3 ) and centrifuged at 18 , 000r . p . m . , keeping the supernatant which was then ﬁltered through cheese cloth . To remove contaminants , 3 . 3M KCl was added and the solution was centrifuged at 18 , 000r . p . m . , keeping the supernatant , which was again ﬁltered through cheese cloth . The solution was dialysed overnight in 1mM MgCl 2 and 100mM KCl to polymerize ﬁlaments , followed by the addition of 800mM KCl to dissociate contaminating proteins from the ﬁlaments . After centrifugation at 35 , 000r . p . m . , the pellet was resuspended and dialyzed in G - buffer to depolymerize . Aggregates were removed from the solution by centrifugation at 35 , 000r . p . m . Remaining contaminants were eliminated by gel ﬁltration in a Superdex 200 column ( GE Healthcare ) . G - actin was stored in G - buffer : 5mM TRIS pH 7 . 8 , 0 . 2mM ATP , 0 . 1mM CaCl 2 , 1mM DTT and 0 . 01 % NaN 3 . Filament elongation and depolymerization were carried out in standard F - buffer : 5mM TRIS pH 7 . 8 , 0 . 2mM ATP , 50mM KCl , 1mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2mM EGTA , 10mM DTT and 1mM DABCO . We used 40 m M of H 2 O 2 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for Supplementary Fig . 7e . Labelling was done by incubating F - actin with Alexa488 succimidyl ester ( Molecular probes ) , thereby labelling Lysines on the outer surface of polymerized actin . Experiments were carried out with 15 % labelLed actin . Labelling had no incidence on the measured actin assembly rates . Single ﬁlament experiments with microﬂuidics . Microﬂuidics experiments ( Fig . 6a – c ; Supplementary Fig . 7c – e ) were done in PDMS microchambers with 3 or 4 entry channels and mounted on a clean glass coverslip 50 . Typical dimensions of the microchamber were as follows : 20 to 100 micrometres high , 1mm wide , and 1 . 5cm long . Flow rates ranged from 300 to 10 000nlmin (cid:2) 1 . Control experiments were carried out to verify that chamber dimensions and ﬂow rates had no incidence on the measured actin assembly rates . Spectrin - actin seeds were adsorbed on the coverslip surface , followed by Bovine Serum Albumin ( BSA , Sigma ) for passivation . A solution of 1 m M G - actin was ﬂown in to elongate ﬁlaments , for a period of 5 to 15min . Filaments were then exposed to a critical concentration of 0 . 12 m M G - actin for 15min , allowing them to fully hydrolyse ATP and release inorganic Phosphate while keeping a constant length . The resulting ADP - actin ﬁlaments were then exposed to buffer or protein solutions , and their depolymerization was monitored . In the microﬂuidics set - up , the solution to which the ﬁlaments are exposed is changed in less than a second . In the presence of FAD þ NADPH , ﬁlaments typically depolymerized in o 200s . However , due to photoinduced pauses , which are an independent phenomenon that we have characterized elsewhere 62 , some ﬁlaments resumed depolymerization after a pause of a few minutes , thereby allowing us to measure the depolymerization rate over longer time scales , as shown in Fig . 6b . In the kymograph on the left of Fig . 6c , depolymerization conditions were changed from FAD þ NADPH to buffer alone , 85s after the onset of depolymerization . In the kymograph on the right of Fig . 6c , long ADP - actin ﬁlaments were exposed to FAD þ NADPH for 150s , before being elongated again from fresh G - actin in F - buffer ( no FAD ) , then aged again for 15min , and ﬁnally depolymerized in buffer . Single ﬁlament experiments with multiple surface anchoring . Surface - anchored experiments ( Fig . 6d , f ; Supplementary Fig . 7a ) were done as follows 23 : ﬂow channels were built with a clean coverslip mounted on a microscope slide , using paraﬁlm as a spacer . Each channel was incubated with inactivated myosin , obtained by incubating rabbit muscle myosin ( Cytoskeleton Inc . ) with N - ethylmaleimide ( Sigma ) . Channels were then passivated with BSA and rinsed , before diluting and ﬂowing in a solution of steady - state actin ﬁlaments . Unbound ﬁlaments were washed out with buffer , and the depolymerizing solution was ﬂown in . The delay between the introduction of the depolymerizing solution in the sample and the start of the microscope acquisition was typically of 1 . 5 to 2min ( unlike microﬂuidics experiments , where depolymerization was monitored from time zero ) . In these experiments , depolymerizing ﬁlaments sometimes exhibited irregular kymographs , with multiple short pauses , in addition to the photoinduced pauses mentioned above 62 . These are certainly due to the multiple interactions between the surface myosins and the ﬁlaments , as already reported in the ﬁrst experiments of this type 63 . These events were excluded from our analysis , and we only ﬁtted periods of clear depolymerization occurring steadily over several consecutive time frames . Image acquisition and analysis . Images were acquired with (cid:3) 60 magniﬁcation , on either a Nikon Te2000 inverted microscope in epiﬂuorescence with an Xcite 120Q light source ( Lumen Dynamics ) and an Orca - ﬂash2 . 8 camera ( Hamamatsu ) ; or on a Nikon Ti - E Eclipse inverted microscope , either in epiﬂuorescence with an Xcite exacte light source ( Lumen Dynamics ) and an Orca - ﬂash4 . 0 camera ( Hamamatsu ) , or in TIRF with an ILAS2 ( Roper ) , a 150mW 488nm laser and an Evolve 512 EMCCD camera ( Photometrics ) . Epiﬂuorescence images were acquired using m - manager , TIRF acquisitions were carried out using MetaMorph . During ﬁlament depolymerization , images were typically acquired every 5 or 10s . Images were analysed with image J or using homemade software written in Python . In Image J , the Multiplekymograph plugin was used to generate the kymographs shown in Fig . 6 and Supplementary Fig . 7 . The depolymerization rates shown in Fig . 6f and Supplementary Fig . 7a were determined by measuring the slope of regular portions of these kymographs , excluding pausing events , be they photoinduced or caused by multiple surface anchors . The depolymerization rates of Fig . 6b and Supplementary Fig . 7d , e were determined with the Python software : ﬁlament lengths were determined from intensity linescans of their contour , and tracked over time . Depolymerization rates were determined by a linear ﬁt of the length over 3 consecutive time points ( that is , a total interval of 20s ) . Photoinduced pauses were excluded from the analysis .

Recombinant expres - sion of Rab35 1 - 175 , Rab35 1 - 199 , MICAL1 879 – 1067 , MICAL1 918 – 1026 and MICAL1 918 – 1067 WT ( as well as , MICAL1 918 – 1067 mutants S1 ( E946K , V950D , E953K , V971E , L975R and E978R ) , S2 ( R1012E , M1015R , L1034K and V1038E ) , S3 ( E1001R , V1038E , V1041 E , I1048R and R1055E ) and single mutants M1015R , I1048R and R1055E ) were performed in Escherichia coli BL21 - CodonPlus - RILP or BL21 - Gold cells using a pPROEX - HTb vectors containing an N - terminal 6xHis peptide and rTEV cleavage site . Bacterial cells were grown at 37 (cid:2) C in LB medium , induced at an A 600nm of 0 . 6 by the addition of 1mM isopropyl - 1 - thio - b - D - galactopyranoside , and collected after 18h at 20 (cid:2) C . The cell pellet was resuspended in 50mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 300mM NaCl , 2mM MgCl 2 , 30mM imidazole , 2mM 2 - mercaptoethanol , 5 % glycerol and protease inhibitor mix ( Chymostatin , Leupeptin , Antipain , Pepstatin A at 1 m gml (cid:2) 1 ) , lysed by sonication , and centrifuged at 35 , 000 g for 1h . The supernatant was loaded onto a HisTrap column ( GE Healthcare ) . After washing with the lysis buffer , the fusion proteins were eluted with 300mM imidazole added in the same buffer . The his - tag was cleaved by incubation with rTEV protease at 1 : 50 molar ratio overnight . The protein was further puriﬁed by gel ﬁltration on Superdex - 75 ( GE Healthcare ) in 50mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 150mM NaCl , 2mM MgCl 2 , 2mM TCEP , 5 % glycerol , concentrated using Vivaspin turbo ( Sartorius ) and stored at (cid:2) 80 (cid:2) C . For the production of selenomethionine derivatized MICAL1 918 - 1067 we used the methionine auxotrophic E . coli strain B834 ( DE3 ) and SelenoMet Medium ( Molecular Dimensions ) . For nucleotide exchange , Rab35 was incubated with a 20 - fold molar excess of GppNHp , in 50mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 150mM NaCl , 2mM TCEP , 5 % glycerol and 5mM EDTA . The exchange reaction was quenched by addition of 10mM MgCl 2 , and excess nucleotide was removed by gel ﬁltration chromatography . Crystallization and structure determination . The crystallization experiments were performed at 17 (cid:2) C by vapour diffusion in hanging drops . Crystals of the Se - Met MICAL1 918 - 1067 were grown in 35 % ethylene glycol and 4 % 1 , 6 - hexanediol . The crystals were ﬂash - frozen in liquid nitrogen . An anomalous X - ray diffraction data set was collected to 3 . 3Å resolution at Soleil synchrotron PX1 beamline . The X - ray diffraction data were indexed , integrated and scaled with the XDS program suite 64 The structure was determined by single - wavelength anomalous diffraction method with the Phenix ( Autosol ) 65 . The program determined positions of two selenium atoms ( see the anomalous difference map in Supplementary Fig . 3a ) , subsequent phasing and density modiﬁcation resulted in an interpretable electron density map allowing to build an initial model with Phenix ( Autobuild ) 65 . The model was reﬁned using the Phenix ( Reﬁne ) programs 65 and manual rebuilding using COOT 66 . The data collection and reﬁnement statistics are summarized in Supplementary Table 2 . Isothermal titration calorimetry . Isothermal titration calorimetry was performed using a MicroCal ITC - 200 titration microcalorimeter ( Malvern ) at 10 (cid:2) C . The ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms14528 14 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 8 : 14528 | DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncomms14528 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications C - terminal MICAL1 domain at a concentration of 60 m M in the interaction buffer ( 50mM Tris buffer , pH 8 , 150mM NaCl , 2mM MgCl 2 , 2mM TCEP and 5 % Glycerol ) , was placed in the calorimeter cell , and GppNHp - Rab35 ( 480 m M in the interaction buffer ) was added sequentially in 2 m l aliquots . The heat of reaction per injection ( microcalories per second ) was determined by integration of the peak areas using the Origin software and provided the heat of binding , the binding stoichiometry , and the interaction association constant using a one - site model . The heats of dilution were determined in parallel control experiments by injecting GppNHp - Rab35 ( 480 m M in the interaction buffer ) into the interaction buffer . The heat of dilution was subtracted from the interaction heat before ﬁtting the curve . SEC – MALS . Absolute molar masses of proteins were determined using size - exclusion chromatography combined with multi - angle light scattering ( SEC – MALS ) . Protein samples ( 50 m l ; 10mgml (cid:2) 1 ) were loaded onto a Superdex - 75 column ( GE Healthcare ) or XBridge BEH SEC 200Å in 50mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 150mM NaCl , 2mM MgCl 2 , 2mM TCEP , 5 % glycerol , at 0 . 5mlmin (cid:2) 1 using a Dionex UltiMate 3000 HPLC system . The column output was fed into a DAWN HELEOS II MALS detector ( Wyatt Technology ) . Data were collected and analysed using Astra X software ( Wyatt Technology ) . Molecular masses were calculated across eluted protein peaks . SAXS measurements and data analysis . Small angle X - ray scattering ( SAXS ) data were collected on the SWING beamline ( synchrotron SOLEIL , France ) . MICAL1 918 - 1067 WT , S1 , S2 and S3 constructs 50 m l at 10mgml (cid:2) 1 were injected on the online HPLC system ( Agilent SEC - 5 500Å ) in 50mM Tris pH 8 , 150mM NaCl , 2mM TCEP , 2mM MgCl 2 , 5 % glycerol . Twenty to 29 frames of 1 . 5s exposure ( and 45 for the buffer ) were averaged and buffer scattering was subtracted from the sample data . The radius of gyration and the intensity at the origin were determined using the Guinier law 67 . Side chains and loops missing in the X - ray structure were modelled using COOT 66 . FoXS web - server 68 was used to ﬁt the theoretical scattering intensity from the X - ray structure into the experimental SAXS data . Data availibility .
