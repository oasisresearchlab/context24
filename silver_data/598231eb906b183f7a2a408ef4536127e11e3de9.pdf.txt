How - ever , it is important to acknowledge that speak - ers and the content they produce and require , vary not just by language , but also by cul - ture . Although language and culture are tightly linked , there are important differences . Anal - ogous to cross - lingual and multilingual NLP , cross - cultural and multicultural NLP consid - ers these differences in order to better serve users of NLP systems . We propose a princi - pled framework to frame these efforts , and sur - vey existing and potential strategies . 1 A Framework for Cultural Awareness Language technology is rapidly advancing for a minority of the world‚Äôs languages . At the same time , the majority of languages are falling behind ( Joshi et al . , 2020 ) . It is essential that language technology can serve the speakers of a wide variety of languages , who come from a wide variety of cultures . In this paper , we argue that doing so requires accommodating these speakers not only on a linguistic level , but also on a cultural level . Culture , like language , is a term that is hard to pin down , but generally describes the way of life of a collective group of people , and distinguishes them from other groups with other cultures ( Mora , 2013 ; Shweder et al . , 2007 ) . Culture encompasses both material as well as non - material aspects , such as beliefs and linguistic practices ( Kendall et al . , 2005 ) . Moreover , since ‚Äú [ c ] ulture is the acquired knowledge people use to interpret experience and generate behavior‚Äù ( Spradley , 1972 ) , it is also the lens through which people understand linguistic messages . Culturally maladapted messages can üí¨ Linguistic Form and Style ‚õ∞ Common Ground üíô Aboutness üß≠ Objectives and Values Figure 1 : The role of culture in NLP , illustrated by four dimensions along which cultures vary , and for which NLP can be culturally biased : linguistic form and style , common ground , aboutness , and objectives ( values ) . and will be misinterpreted ; NLP must be culturally sensitive in order to avoid doing harm . Language and culture interact in a number of ways ( see Figure 1 ) . This paper aims to illuminate these connections , in order to motivate and inform future NLP work . Beyond linguistic form and style , how things are expressed in language , they include common ground , the shared knowledge based on which people reason and communicate ; aboutness , what information people care to con - vey ; and objectives or values , the goals people strive for ( e . g . , when developing language technol - ogy ) . Since language and culture are intertwined , the different dimensions may be difÔ¨Åcult to tease apart ( Hovy and Yang , 2021 ) : for example , the lexi - con is shaped both by the need to convey infor - mation people care about , and by the conceptual categories grounded in the environment . Style is related to values and societal structure : formality levels in Japanese , for example , reÔ¨Çect the hierar - chy of Japanese society ( Gao , 2005 ) . Nevertheless , language and culture are not interchangeable terms . Culture varies greatly within languages ( Lin et al . , a r X i v : 2203 . 10020v1 [ c s . C L ] 18 M a r 2022 2018 ) . For example , the assumption that ‚ÄúEnglish‚Äù in and of itself carries a single set of worldviews , interests and norms is unjustiÔ¨Åed ( Paul and Girju , 2009 ; Wilson et al . , 2016 ) . On the other hand , a relatively homogeneous culture can span multiple languages , as in the Nordic countries ( Sahlgren et al . , 2021 ) . Contributions . We propose a framework for un - derstanding the challenges that cultural diversity poses for NLP to serve all users , as well as the opportunities that NLP creates to understand these differences better . We consider four elements : lin - guistic form , common ground , aboutness and val - ues . We then survey existing strategies in NLP to address these challenges . Highlighting limitations in current strategies , as well as successful exam - ples , we propose directions for future development of cross - cultural NLP . 2 Linguistic Form and Style Linguistic form refers to non - semantic questions of how to formulate an utterance . Most work on cross - lingual NLP has focused on how linguistic form varies between languages . However , the impact of social and cultural factors on linguistic form and stylistic variations is rarely discussed ( Hovy and Yang , 2021 ) . Variation within language . How to circum - scribe and deÔ¨Åne a particular language is a difÔ¨Åcult problem ( Eberhard et al . , 2021 ) . A language spo - ken in different countries often becomes standard - ized in slightly different ways ( e . g . , German in Aus - tria and Germany ) . Geo - cultural variation within a language also gives rise to dialects ( Zampieri et al . , 2020 ; Wolfram and Friday , 1997 ; Brown et al . , 2020 ) , which in turn operate as an important sign of cultural identity ( Falck et al . , 2012 ) . In ad - dition , sociolects vary across social groups , which can include subcultures ( McCormack et al . , 2011 ) . Due to these variations , treating ‚Äúa language‚Äù as a homogeneous mass limits cultural adaptation , and runs the risk of privileging certain cultures over others . Zhang et al . ( 2021 ) Ô¨Ånd that pre - trained language models ( PLMs ; see ¬ß 6 ) reÔ¨Çect certain sociolects more than others . For example , there are considerable morphosyntactic variations between Spanish spoken in Spain and Argentina ( Bentivoglio and Sedano , 2011 ) , but they are not considered separately in a Spanish PLM ( Ca√±ete et al . , 2020 ) . A PLM speciÔ¨Åc to the Algerian di - alect of Arabic performs better than a multilingual or general Arabic one ( Antoun et al . , 2020 ) in sen - timent classiÔ¨Åcation ( Abdaoui et al . , 2021 ) . Stylistic variation . Factors such as directness and formality are often associated with different communicative styles across cultures . For example , the level of politeness and thus also how offensive something is perceived depends very much on com - municative norms ( Gao , 2005 ; Larina , 2015 ) . Mis - understandings that arise from different commu - nicative styles can occur in any interaction between people of different cultural backgrounds . Thomas ( 1983 ) refers to this as pragmatic failure , namely the ‚Äúinability to understand ‚Äòwhat is meant by what is said‚Äù‚Äô , due to how it is being said . Compara - tive stylistics ( Vinay and Darbelnet , 1995 ) aims to characterise these differences . The same intention ( e . g . , to be polite ) can lead to different forms in different cultures . For exam - ple , an offer of help can be made in an imperative form in Polish , while in English speaking Anglo - Saxon cultures , this form would be considered rude and so an interrogative form would be used in - stead ( Wierzbicka , 2009 ) . Similarly , German na - tive speakers tend to use a high level of directness , which would be considered offensive in English ( House and Kasper , 2011 ) . Based on the observa - tion that such differences exist , Ringel et al . ( 2019 ) applied distant supervision by inducing labels for English formality and sarcasm detection based on language‚Äîin this case German and Japanese , re - spectively . The expression and perception of emotion also varies across cultures , both in text ( Kirmayer et al . , 2001 ; Ryder et al . , 2008 ) and in face - to - face com - munication ( Hareli et al . , 2015 ) . These differences are critical for cross - cultural sentiment analysis ( Bautin et al . , 2008 ) and for text - based recognition of medical conditions such as depression . For ex - ample , Loveys et al . ( 2018 ) Ô¨Ånd clear differences in linguistic form across English speakers of different ethnic identities with self - reported depression ( e . g . , the ratio of positive to negative emotion expres - sion ) . Not understanding cross - cultural variation could lead to misclassiÔ¨Åcation of movies , or worse , mis - diagnosing people . 3 Common Ground A culture is in part deÔ¨Åned by a shared common ground : the shared body of knowledge that can be talked about and that can be assumed as known by others . This common ground varies from culture to culture , and thus cross - cultural language use has to take into account shifts in common ground . These cross - cultural shifts , often correlating with cross - lingual shifts , are neglected in NLP . An un - derlying assumption in many approaches to mul - tilingual NLP is that ‚Äúdifferent languages share a similar semantic structure‚Äù ( Miceli Barone , 2016 ) . However , the assumption that there is a cross - lingual , cross - culturally common semantics to pre - serve fails when the common grounding does not match between cultures . Two relevant aspects here are the set of relevant concepts , closely identiÔ¨Åed with problems of lexicalisation , and common sense , i . e . , the relevant propositional knowledge used in reasoning and entailment . Conceptualisation . People carve up the world using conceptual categories ( Margolis and Lau - rence , 2021 ) . While some general or even universal patterns exist ( Wierzbicka , 1996 ) , these categories can and do differ between languages and cultures : the domain of colour is a famous example ( Berlin and Kay , 1969 ) , but cross - cultural differences are also reÔ¨Çected in kinship systems ( the lexicaliza - tion of family structures Murdock , 1970 ) , spatial relations ( Bowerman and Choi , 2001 ) and basic ob - jects ( e . g . , where to draw the distinction between a ‚Äòcup‚Äô and a ‚Äòmug‚Äô , or the ‚Äòhand‚Äô and the ‚Äòarm‚Äô ; Majid et al . , 2015 ) . Translating between languages thus entails translating between conceptualisations , which can be impossible if the conceptual ground - ing is not available ( is this Danish ‚Äúkop‚Äù an En - glish ‚Äòcup‚Äô or a ‚Äòmug ? ‚Äô ) ‚Äîthis is the motivation behind multimodal , i . e . , visually grounded , trans - lation ( Specia et al . , 2016 ) . Data collected from a single culture may contain concepts that do not easily map across cultures , as for example seen in the recent MarVL dataset ( Liu et al . , 2021 ) , in which about a quarter of concepts from a sample of non - Western cultures did not map to English concepts ( as represented by WordNet ) . Commonsense knowledge . ‚ÄúCommon sense‚Äù is the knowledge that is held in common by a commu - nity and culture , the communal knowledge bank that can be presumed to be known by everyone . Common sense thus covers a diverse set of knowl - edge types , from physical and temporal reasoning to psychological , social and moral judgements ( Sap et al . , 2020 ) . Some aspects of common sense are fairly universal , in particular those that arise from inhabiting a grounded human body on earth ( drop - ping a glass of juice onto a hard surface is likely to cause a mess ; the baby might be crying because it‚Äôs hungry ) . On the other hand , axioms of social and moral common sense , for example the how and why of rituals such as marriages , vary between cultures ( Acharya et al . , 2021 ) . Moving between different banks of common sense can involve different strategies to either pro - vide missing background / common knowledge , or to transfer the content to a target - culture appropri - ate setting ( see ¬ß 6 . 3 ) . 4 Aboutness Cultures promote different topics and issues ( Seib - ert et al . , 2002 ) , sometimes by necessity , sometimes by accident . 1 Some of the domains commonly considered in ( English - speaking , Anglo - western ) NLP are irrelevant to some cultures , while others mean different things to different cultures , i . e . , they involve completely different practices . An exam - ple of the former is beer reviews , a go - to domain in sentiment analysis ( Zeng et al . , 2019 ; Ji et al . , 2020 ; Paranjape et al . , 2020 ) . Beer reviews are hardly meaningful in cultures with no beer con - sumption . An example of the latter , i . e . , a domain that is used differently across cultures and social groups , is Twitter ( Hine , 2020 ) . As an example of multi - domain sentiment analysis , Liu et al . ( 2018 ) consider cameras , laptops , restaurants , and movies , within the context of data from U . S . American web - sites . These domains , however , apply differently in other cultures : restaurants are more important in some cultures ( e . g . , Copenhagen hipsters ) than others ( e . g . , S√°mi ) ; similarly , laptops have not pen - etrated cultures equally and have in fact been found to change culture ( Hansen et al . , 2014 ) . Beyond conceptualisation differences ( see ¬ß 3 ) , Liu et al . ( 2021 ) point out how the visual concepts at the core of many multimodal NLP tasks reÔ¨Çect a Northern American and Western European bias in the underlying data sources , from which im - ages were scraped . As an alternative , in their new 1 What we , as human beings , are interested in is , in part , a product of our group memberships . Our group member - ship determines conditions , e . g . , our dependence on weather , agriculture , livestock , etc . , making some topics vital , and pro - motes others e . g . , through fashion , trends , etc . Heidegger ( 1927 , 1953 ) refers to the former as the facticity aspect of our caring ; the latter as the fallenness aspect . Unbiased treatment of the facticity aspect of what cultures care about , has been argued to be particularly important from an ethical perspective ( Nelson , 2008 ) . dataset ( MarVL ) , they let the selection of both con - cepts and images be entirely driven by native speak - ers . This corrects for some existing asymmetries in what our evaluation data tends to be about . For example , Althoff et al . ( 2014 ) created a dataset en - tirely devoted to pizzas ; in Liu et al . ( 2021 ) , mod - els‚Äô ability to recognise vadas , an Indian food , is evaluated . People describe the same events differently across cultures . News reports emphasise different goals , motivations , methods and content in differ - ent parts of the world ( Bandura , 1986 ; Li , 1997 ; Loo , 2019 ) . However , many news resources used in NLP research reÔ¨Çect only some cultures ( Breed , 1955 ; Galtung and Ruge , 1965 ; Marcus et al . , 1993 ) . As NLP technologies have been widely adopted to build multilingual news generators ( Zhang et al . , 2016 ; Xu et al . , 2020 ; Jin et al . , 2020 ) , it is impor - tant that these differences are taken into account in language generation . 5 Objectives and Values Common objectives in NLP include progress , accu - racy , fairness , robustness and interpretability . They are driven by the research community , and reÔ¨Çect the values of this community : novelty , for exam - ple , is highly esteemed , which is not a value held by more conservative , tradition - valuing cultures . Grounding these objectives explicitly in ethical values and norms , and acknowledging that these may differ across cultures , is essential for cross - cultural NLP . Jiang et al . ( 2021 ) , for example , in - troduce C OMMONSENSE N ORM B ANK and Delphi , a moral reasoning resource and model , respectively , reÔ¨Çecting ‚ÄúEnglish - speaking cultures of the United States in the 21st century‚Äù . However , researchers , practitioners , regulators and users may belong to different cultures and have different objectives and values ( Talat et al . , 2021 ) . Another common goal in the NLP community is the eventual expansion of all NLP technologies to low - resource languages . However , as Bird ( 2020 ) points out , this goal must not overshadow , or be placed above , the speciÔ¨Åc desires and needs of a given language community , as every community will have their own objectives for what they do and do not want for their language with regards to technology . Without building relationships with the communities for which we aim to develop NLP , there is a serious risk for imposing our own objec - tives on the community . Importantly , entire categories of applications and tasks may be driven by cultural assumptions . For example , the main objective of text summarisation is brevity ( J√∏rgensen and S√∏gaard , 2021 ) . Likewise , while Ô¨Çuency is a common objective of machine translation , it may in fact , be less important than comprehensibility for users ( Castilho et al . , 2018 ) . Values differ across cultures . Values are an im - portant part of non - materialistic culture , as these values deÔ¨Åne what a speciÔ¨Åc culture deems to be good or valuable , as opposed to bad and undesir - able ( Kendall et al . , 2005 ) . Accordingly , these values help inform what is accepted as normal and ethical behaviour , and shape common cultural atti - tudes . Aspects that clash against a culture‚Äôs values , norms , and ethics , may often be taboo or even ille - gal . As cultures around the world hold different val - ues , their norms and ethics are inevitably different , too ( Sch√§fer et al . , 2015 ; Hanel et al . , 2018 ) . For example , in some cultures , alcohol consumption is prohibited for religious reasons , and thus may not be normal or acceptable behaviour ; meanwhile drinking alcohol can be seen as normal behaviour by some cultures without this shared value . For this reason , beer reviews in an application , for example , may be seen not only as irrelevant ( see ¬ß 4 ) , but even as offensive . While these values can and do change greatly from culture to culture , end - users of NLP systems deserve technologies that are suitable to the culture that they belong to . To this end , the preservation of cultural values , norms , and ethics in models intended for users from different cultures , is another important aspect of cross - cultural NLP ( Solaiman and Dennison , 2021 ) . Fairness and combating biases . Many recent studies in NLP have explored strategies to counter - act unwanted biases ( according to the community‚Äôs values , see above ) in models , resulting from preju - dices present in society . These biases are implicit in the data used to train our models , and become baked into the models themselves ( Bolukbasi et al . , 2016 ; Sap et al . , 2019 ; Sun et al . , 2019 ; Blodgett et al . , 2020 ; Bender et al . , 2021 ) . Because NLP datasets are composed of utterances from members of a larger culture , the resulting biases constitute a partial reÔ¨Çection of that culture‚Äôs values , norms , and ethics . For example , work in NLP on gender bias demonstrate that there is a pervasive problem with sexism in models ( a direct result of sexist at - titudes present in society ) , and explore ways to remedy this ( Friedman et al . , 2019 ; Zhao et al . , 2019 ; Webster et al . , 2021 ; Baker Gillis , 2021 ) . Accordingly , just as members of any culture de - serve language technology that truly serves them , members of vulnerable groups and marginalised members in larger cultures deserve such as well . Current research in addressing fairness and com - bating biases in models demonstrates how NLP can be used to tackle the challenge of inequitable cultural attitudes . In other words , the goal of coun - tering bias in NLP can be seen as shifting existing cultures into hopefully more equitable ones . ConÔ¨Çicting objectives . With regards to cultural values , cross - cultural NLP lies at the intersection of the two important , but potentially conÔ¨Çicting , cross - roads of multicultural pluralism and societal equity : cultures will have different values , which should be respected and represented for end - users ; mean - while , cultures will also have some inequitable atti - tudes that hurt different end - users , and NLP should be part of the solution . Together , these conÔ¨Çicting aspects land cross - cultural NLP in the impossible position of needing to both preserve cultural val - ues , while also minimising harmful cultural biases . We acknowledge that these issues become increas - ingly difÔ¨Åcult to disentangle , especially for more difÔ¨Åcult or taboo aspects of culture . On the one hand , it is dangerous for members of one culture to impose values onto the others ( i . e . this would , in fact , contribute to NLP colonisation‚Äîsee ¬ß 7 ) , and on the other hand , it is dangerous to leave marginalised groups vulnerable , when we can di - minish bias against them . While none of the strate - gies we discuss in ¬ß 6 offers a simple solution to this challenge , our goal is to bring this important conundrum in cross - cultural NLP to the commu - nity‚Äôs attention . To help navigate this convoluted space , and thus ensure end - users have access to rel - evant NLP systems , we encourage people working in this space to collaborate with members of the culture relevant to their work , as they are the best equipped to judge what cultural aspects can appro - priately be challenged . Additionally , new works in AI ethics should also be considered ( Nanayakkara et al . , 2021 ; Hagendorff , 2020 ; Prunkl et al . , 2021 ; Pitta et al . , 1999 ; Mohamed et al . , 2020 ) . An in - ternational regulatory instrument is essential for the responsible development of AI , a task that UN - ESCO is in the process of undertaking . 2 2 https : / / en . unesco . org / courier / 2018 - 3 / towards - global - code - ethics - artiÔ¨Åcial - intelligence - research 6 Strategies We have identiÔ¨Åed several challenges along four dimensions of culture . Here , we highlight gen - eral strategies for cross - cultural NLP . We identify three main areas where we could direct efforts to - wards mitigating cross - cultural disparities : data collection , model training , and translation . Data is the backbone of NLP and any efforts towards cross - cultural NLP needs to consider the strategies involved in collecting and annotating it . Transfer learning is central to cross - lingual NLP and can serve an important role in cross - cultural NLP . Fi - nally , translation is used to communicate between languages and will often be necessary when com - municating between cultures . We explain what can be done within each of these areas each in turn . 6 . 1 Data Collection The most fundamental issue is the representation disparity in our data , i . e . , not all cultures are ( equally ) represented . While the volume of multi - lingual datasets increases and multilingual NLU benchmarks are becoming available ( Hu et al . , 2020 ; Liang et al . , 2020 ; Ruder et al . , 2021 ) , this does not guarantee cross - cultural representation . There are two main factors : source of data ( e . g . , me - dia outlet ) and origin of annotations ( e . g . , auto - matic vs human - generated ) . To have truly diverse datasets , we should both ensure that they not only represent diverse sources , but also multiple per - spectives in terms of annotations , when applicable . Data selection and curation . Relevant to the im - pact of the source of data , Dodge et al . ( 2021 ) dis - cuss how the Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus ( C4 ; Raffel et al . , 2020 ) , an English web - based corpus , is skewed in favour of US governmental institu - tions and main - stream US media , while data Ô¨Ålter - ing , which tries to remove slurs , or obscene words , disproportionately removes text from and about minorities ( e . g . , African American and LGBTQ + ) . Similarly , data from Wikipedia is heavily used in multilingual NLP even though it has been shown to be culturally biased ( Callahan and Herring , 2011 ) . To mitigate the risks associated with using cultur - ally biased data , data selection or curation methods should strive to use data sources that are appropri - ate for the target culture of downstream NLP ap - plications . Large , general - purpose datasets should be curated so as to be as unbiased as possible , and carefully documented ( Jo and Gebru , 2020 ; Bender et al . , 2021 ) . As examples of culturally diverse data collection , Liu et al . ( 2021 ) and Yin et al . ( 2021 ) recruit geo - diverse annotators from Africa , Asia and the Ameri - cas who are tasked with also providing the data ( the images ) along with the annotations ( image descrip - tions ) . However , these dataset are small and thus limited to evaluation only ; the cost and effort asso - ciated with collecting sufÔ¨Åcient data to train mod - ern NLP models means that Ô¨Ånding culture - speciÔ¨Åc data to cover the enormous diversity of cultures rep - resented on earth remains a formidable challenge . A diverse and open community , however , facili - tates scalability in this regard . Examples for such communities include Universal Dependencies , ded - icated to manual annotation of morphosyntactic datasets for over one hundred languages , cover - ing the highest typological diversity to date among such datasets ( Nivre et al . , 2020 ) . As another exam - ple , the Masakhane community aims to strengthen NLP research for African languages . It has created MasakhaNER ( Adelani et al . , 2021 ) , a Named En - tity Recognition dataset for 10 African languages , collected by native speakers of these languages . Data annotation . With respect to annotation practices , a diverse pool of annotators reduces the risk of cultural bias . In the case of subjective tasks such as detecting affect , aggression , and hate speech , annotators may systematically disagree with one another due to cultural differences that are often reÔ¨Çected by their biases and values ( Da - vani et al . , 2021 ) . Annotator disagreements may capture important nuances in such tasks that are of - ten ignored while aggregating annotations to a sin - gle ( possibly hegemonic ) ground truth . Release of all annotations with each dataset , even disagreeing ones , allows training models that generalise better ( Plank et al . , 2014 ; Pavlick and Kwiatkowski , 2019 ; Prabhakaran et al . , 2021 ; Gordon et al . , 2022 ) . Careful documentation of the annotation process also plays an important role . In a recent survey of machine learning papers ( including NLP ones ) , Geiger et al . ( 2020 ) reported a wide divergence in the level of documentation about methodological practices in human annotation . They advocate for the importance of human annotation within the re - search process , arguing that it ought to be given as much attention , care , and concern as is currently placed on performance based metrics . When arguing for an increasingly diverse ‚Äòpar - ticipatory design‚Äô ( Bodker et al . , 2009 ) , however , it is important to consider the values , ideologies , codes , narratives , and power relations which gov - ern the interaction between the assemblies of actors involved in data collection and annotation . This is the perspective of social - cultural studies and other critical viewpoints from the humanities ( Mainsah and Morrison , 2014 ; Gray and Suri , 2019 ) . Annotation projection . Of course , data collec - tion for many languages and cultures can be costly . Using parallel data and a word alignment tool , an - notation ( for example a syntactic tree ) in a source language can be transferred to a target language without extra annotation ( Yarowsky et al . , 2001 ; Hwa et al . , 2005 ) . A related method to create multi - lingual datasets is translating a dataset ( typically in English ) into other languages ( often using machine translation ) . While not usually called annotation projection , it can be considered a variation of this method , since the source annotation is ported to the translated data . For example , in XNLI ( Con - neau et al . , 2018 ) , the premise and hypothesis pair is translated from English to other languages and the label is reused for the translated pair . These methods help leverage data from high - resource lan - guages to create more data for low - resource lan - guages ( Agi¬¥c , 2017 ) . However , these methods risk ignoring target culture complexity or forcing the source culture concepts on the target culture . For example , En - glish common sense datasets ( Singh et al . , 2021 ) include culture - speciÔ¨Åc concepts such as food in - gredients , 3 rituals and celebrations , 4 and societal expectations . 5 Translating this dataset into other languages will require making decisions about how , and whether , to modify these items to make them more intelligible in the target culture . Lin et al . ( 2021a ) use machine translation to translate two common - sense reasoning datasets from English into 14 other languages . They attempt to deal with difÔ¨Åcult cases by automatically Ô¨Çagging and re - moving examples which contain ‚Äòsocial keywords‚Äô from the dataset , or that are ( again , automatically ) labeled as containing non - neutral sentiment . How - ever , these methods are unlikely to capture all ex - amples of social behaviour and cannot identify ex - amples of cultural over - speciÔ¨Åcity ( sports teams , 3 A hot sauce is going to be hotter if it uses jalape√±o pep - pers rather than habanero . 4 Colt doesn‚Äôt have any kids . Finley has four kids . There - fore , Finley is more likely to go Trick or Treating . 5 Many people disapproved of the widow waiting one week after his [ sic ] wife‚Äôs death to start dating again , rather than one year . jalape√±os ) . Automatically translated training data can lead to worse performance than native tar - get language data ( Liu et al . , 2021 ) . However , if evaluation data is automatically translated too , we have no trivial way of exposing cultural biases introduced by the projection process . Culturally - aware evaluation thus necessitates data annotated directly in the target language , or at least culturally - sensitive human translations . Ponti et al . ( 2020 ) point out that literal trans - lation of datasets is sometimes impossible or un - desirable due to culture - speciÔ¨Åc concepts in the source that may be missing or unnatural in the tar - get . In their multilingual extension of the English Choice of Plausible Alternatives ( COPA ; Roem - mele et al . , 2011 ) dataset , they therefore asked ‚Äúcarefully chosen‚Äù human translators to perform culturally - sensitive translation , and either para - phrase , substitute the original concepts with similar ones that exist in the target language , or leverage phonetically transcribed loan words . Human translation , or original data from the tar - get culture , is clearly the expensive option , but will often be the only way to avoid cultural bias . Only translating / generating high - quality evaluation data is becoming an attractive middle ground option ( Liu et al . , 2021 ; Ponti et al . , 2020 ; Yin et al . , 2021 ) that at least allows us to judge the success of cross - lingual transfer in a culturally appropriate way . 6 . 2 Model Training Models can be culturally biased even when trained on culturally diverse data . On the other end , di - verse cultural representation can in some cases be achieved with speciÔ¨Åc training strategies , not only data selection and annotation . Transfer learning and pre - training . A com - mon strategy in machine learning is to transfer the knowledge acquired for a task , domain or language to another . It is used extensively in the context of cross - lingual learning , motivated by similarities between languages and cultures : if only the form differs between languages , then models can learn to abstract away from it and transfer from resource - rich languages , obviating task - speciÔ¨Åc training data in many languages ( Agi¬¥c , 2017 ; Wu and Dredze , 2019 ; Blloshmi et al . , 2020 ) . In this context , approaches for creating cross - lingual word embeddings ( Klementiev et al . , 2012 ; Ammar et al . , 2016 ) are based on the assumption that the semantic spaces of different languages are approximately isomorphic . However , this assump - tion is violated in practice ( S√∏gaard et al . , 2018 , 2019 ) . Among linguistic reasons , cultural factors ( e . g . , conceptualisation ) can play a role in the mis - match between the spaces . Though hardly ever considered when selecting the source language for model transfer , considering cultural factors im - proves performance on target languages in prag - matically motivated tasks ( Sun et al . , 2021 ) . In recent years , model transfer has been the mainstream paradigm with the advent of pre - trained language models ( PLMs ) , and speciÔ¨Åcally , multilingual PLMs such as mBERT ( Devlin et al . , 2019 ) and XLM - R ( Conneau et al . , 2020 ) . Lan - guage models require massive amounts of data to pre - train . Since corpora are largely skewed in favour of few languages , this leads to cross - lingual disparities . To mitigate this issue , Con - neau and Lample ( 2019 ) introduced an exponential smoothing of the language sampling rate leading to a less skewed data selection . Conneau et al . ( 2020 ) and Xue et al . ( 2021 ) further studied the effect of the language sampling rate , and found that more uniform sampling improves performance in low - resource languages , but hurts high - resource languages . The reliance on pre - training means that what PLMs encode has far - reaching consequences . Sev - eral works Ô¨Ånd differences in culture - speciÔ¨Åc com - monsense knowledge in multilingual PLMs , de - pending on the language used to probe them . These include differences in factual knowledge ( Kass - ner et al . , 2021 ) , grounding of time - of - day expres - sions ( Shwartz , 2022 ) , and social value ( Lin et al . , 2021b ) . Understanding these differences better will facilitate cultural adaptation and debiasing of NLP systems . Training . The common methodology for train - ing machine learning models ( e . g . , empirical loss minimisation ) relies on maximising average perfor - mance across training examples ( instead of groups , e . g . , languages ) , which often leads to low minority performance , a phenomenon named representation disparity ( Hashimoto et al . , 2018 ) . Model perfor - mance for minorities is often disregarded in favour of majority groups , as shown for race ( Blodgett and O‚ÄôConnor , 2017 ) , gender ( J√∏rgensen and S√∏gaard , 2021 ) , and age ( Zhang et al . , 2021 ) . Deriving fair models from biased data is a promising counter - measure ( Mehrabi et al . , 2021 ) . In a cross - cultural setting , methodologies that account for model up - dates for different groups ( Hashimoto et al . , 2018 ; Sagawa et al . , 2020 ; Levy et al . , 2020 ) could po - tentially reduce cultural biases . Most methods to balance for bias require access to protected demo - graphic attributes ( Sagawa et al . , 2020 ) , and these only partially reÔ¨Çect culture . In this direction , Zhou et al . ( 2021 ) and Ponti et al . ( 2021 ) propose using Group Distribution - ally Robust Optimisation ( group DRO ; Oren et al . , 2019 ) to optimise worst - case performance across languages . Similarly , de Lhoneux et al . ( 2022 ) used Worst - Case - Aware Curriculum Learning ( Zhang et al . , 2020 ) to improve group ( language ) perfor - mance parity in cross - lingual dependency parsing . However , Lent et al . ( 2021 ) Ô¨Ånd that group DRO has no beneÔ¨Åt in a low - resource settings , namely for Creole languages . Such techniques can poten - tially be applied to pre - training multilingual lan - guage models with better cross - lingual parity , possi - bly in addition to improved data sampling . Further - more , a fairer model with respect to other attributes , besides the language dimension , can lead to less culturally biased models . While these measures are widely discussed in a multilingual framework , they are also applicable in a monolingual setting to favour a more equal representation of different cultures in a single language ( e . g . , a fairer rep - resentation of English - speaking communities for English NLP ) . Limitations . Nonetheless , cross - lingual counter - measures are culture - agnostic . In other words , even if we sample languages equally , cross - cultural dis - parity persists , as data for a given language is also not balanced in terms of sources , and hence cul - tures . However , one can directly target a more diverse cross - cultural representation by applying the same principles in terms of cultures instead of languages . Ideally , methods such as data sampling or group DRO should facilitate generalisation of universally - common knowledge from highly - represented cul - tures , while granting equal representation to minor - ity cultures . Overemphasising the former is prob - lematic as it contributes to cultural homogenisation , while the latter enables mitigation of cross - cultural biases present in the underlying training data and models . There is no substitute for a larger repre - sentation of minority cultures in the data used for training and evaluation . Finally , practical concerns include the level of granularity at which cultural groups are deÔ¨Åned and annotated in the data ( e . g . , as metadata attributes or criteria for splitting text corpora ) . There is a contin - uum from representing each individual separately ( which may raise privacy concerns ) to considering large , culturally diverse groups ( such as all Spanish speakers ) as a homogeneous mass . Again , NLP dataset creators as well as model developers must be aware of the trade - off between generalisation and adaptation here . 6 . 3 Translation Beyond NLP for various cultures , cross - cultural NLP can be used for bridging between cultures , investigating cross - cultural communication . The classic example is machine translation ( MT ) be - tween languages . In MT , semantic divergences are usually treated as noise , or in any case , as imperfect translations ( Briakou and Carpuat , 2021 ) . A com - monly accepted criterion for translation adequacy is that the semantics of the source are preserved in the output ( Carl , 1998 ; Sulem et al . , 2015 ) . How - ever , when applied for translation across cultures , translation may have different objectives . The same meaning may be inappropriate in the target culture , regardless of Ô¨Çuency , and require adjustments : this is referred to as adaptation in the translation Ô¨Åeld ( Vinay and Darbelnet , 1995 ) . Peskov et al . ( 2021 ) observed that translated sentences are often opaque without cultural context ( e . g . , ‚ÄúI saw Merkel eating a Berliner from Dietsch on the ICE‚Äù ) , and propose adapting entities to the target culture by substituting them with their approximate counterparts . As an al - ternative strategy , adding explanations , for example in the form of appositives ( Kementchedjhieva et al . , 2020 ) , can elucidate entities that are known in the source culture but not in the target culture . These are examples of cross - cultural translation ( Sper - ber et al . , 1994 ) . This kind of adaptation can also be helpful in culturally - situated dialogue , where some users may be less familiar with the common ground of a particular culture ; in such cases , Abou - Khalil et al . ( 2018 ) propose to explain by analogy to concepts from the user‚Äôs home culture . Cross - cultural translation is not necessarily al - ways between languages , but could take the form of style transfer within a language ( Shen et al . , 2017 ; Prabhumoye et al . , 2018 ) . For example , Jhamtani et al . ( 2017 ) transform text from modern English to Shakespearean English . Roy et al . ( 2015 ) approach personalised marketing by adapting the style of marketing messages for speciÔ¨Åc audience segments , deÔ¨Åned by geographic location and occupation . Evaluation of cross - cultural translation is chal - lenging , as the task is not always well - deÔ¨Åned . In particular , for style transfer , human evaluation is more reliable than automatic evaluation , but still suffers from non - standard evaluation proto - cols ( Briakou et al . , 2021a , b ) . Reference - based automatic evaluation methods are particularly un - reliable in this case , as the assumption that there is just one ( or a few ) correct translations is ostensibly violated ( Song et al . , 2013 ; Reiter , 2018 ) . This stresses the need for culture - sensitive human evalu - ation . 7 Conclusion In this paper , we have touched on a number of ways in which cultural knowledge , preferences and val - ues can affect NLP practices . It is important to acknowledge the breadth of culture in all of these aspects , if we should aspire to a more cross - cultural NLP . However , we do not pretend to cover all rel - evant aspects of culture in our taxonomy : many works in sociology posture frameworks to better explain and catalogue the speciÔ¨Åc elements that compose a culture ( Dant , 1999 ; Hofstede , 2001 ; Kendall et al . , 2005 ; Woodward , 2007 ) . We encour - age further investigation of their impact on NLP . Finally , present - day computational science have inherited colonising practices , which in NLP are realised as ‚Äúhomogenisation of perspectives‚Äù and ‚Äúalgorithmic monoculture‚Äù ( Kleinberg and Ragha - van , 2021 ; Bommasani et al . , 2021 ) . While there is general agreement in the NLP community that we need to represent cultures from outside Western , Educated , Industrialised , Rich , and Democratic ( WEIRD ) societies ( Henrich et al . , 2010 ) , represen - tation alone is not enough if we do not also allow them to prioritise their goals and values , rather than the goals and values held by the NLP community . Decolonisation ( Bird , 2020 ; Mohamed et al . , 2020 ; Birhane and Guest , 2021 ) aims to dismantle harm - ful power asymmetries and concepts of knowledge , turning us instead towards a ‚Äúpluriversal episte - mology of the future‚Äù ( Mignolo , 2012 ) that unlike universalisms , acknowledges and supports a wider radius of socio - political , ecological , cultural , and economic needs ( Mohamed et al . , 2020 ) .

It is not our place to settle this conÔ¨Çict or to provide answers , but we stress that asking the question , of which values should prevail in each case , is essential for cross - cultural NLP . Furthermore , language technology for local communities must involve the members of those communities in an active , participatory manner , in order to decolonise language technology and re - spect the sovereignty of local people over their data ( Bird , 2020 ; Mukhija et al . , 2021 ) .
