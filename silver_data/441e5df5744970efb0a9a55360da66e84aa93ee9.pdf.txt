1 1 Designing for Productive Failure Manu Kapur Head , Learning Sciences Lab Associate Professor of Curriculum , Teaching & Learning National Institute of Education , Singapore Apr 20 , Tokyo 2013 2 What is Productive Failure ? Understand what students know about a novel concept that they have not been taught yet Afford opportunities to activate and differentiate prior and intuitive knowledge… . to generate , explore , critique , and refine representations and solution methods ( RSMs ) for solving complex problems Invariably , such a process leads to failure ( in relation to a desired goal ) … Designing for failure in the initial learning to minimize failure in the longer term… But , this may precisely be the locus of deep learning… provided some form of structure follows subsequently 2 3 Two phases of the PF design ( Kapur & Bielaczyc , 2012 ) PHASE I Complex problems Collaboration Affective support for persistence PHASE II Consolidation Well - structured Problem solving OR Instruction OR Feedback OR Explanation , etc .

Direct Instruction Target Concepts : 1 . Average Speed ( Kapur , 2010 ; Kapur & Bielaczyc , 2012 ) 2 . Standard Deviation ( Kapur , 2012 ) Direct Instruction Teacher explains concept , models problem solving , uses worked - out examples , practice and feedback Productive Failure Students generate multiple representations and solution methods , followed by instruction Dependent Variables : 1 ) Procedural Fluency 2 ) Conceptual Understanding 3 ) Transfer 6 11 Summary of Key Findings • PF outperformed DI on conceptual understanding and transfer without compromising procedural fluency ( Kapur , 2010 , 2012 ; Kapur & Bielaczyc , 2012 ) • Students that seem strikingly dissimilar on general and math ability ( PSLE ) appear strikingly similar in terms of their generative capacity ( Kapur & Bielaczyc , 2012 ) • RSM diversity significantly correlated with learning gains ( Kapur , 2012 ; Kapur & Bielaczyc , 2012 ) • Teachers consistently underestimate students’ ability to generate RSMs • PF teachers consistently report that they are stressed and stretched to work with students’ ideas… BUT , they themselves understood the math better… 12 Four mechanisms of the PF design ( Kapur & Bielaczyc , 2012 ) Activation and differentiation of prior knowledge Attention to critical conceptual features of the targeted concepts Explanation and elaboration of these features Consolidation and Knowledge Assembly 7 Three layers of the PF design ( Kapur & Bielaczyc , 2012 ) Social surround used to frame the problem - solving context Participants structures used to engage with the problem The activity engaged in by participants 7 Designing for Productive Failure ( Kapur & Bielaczyc , 2012 ) DESIGN LAYERS AND THE EMBODIED PRINCIPLES DESIGN PHASES TASK PARTICIPATIONSTRUCTURES SOCIAL SURROUND 1 . Generate and explore multiple representations and solutions methods ( RSMs ) Design tasks that are adequately complex , engaging , and draw on students’ mathematical resources Enable collaboration to allow students to elaborate , critique , explain , and evaluate shared work , thereby further enriching the shared representation and solution spaces Create a safe space for students to explore and generate by setting appropriate socio - mathematical norms , and providing affective support for persistence 2 . Organizatio n and Knowledge Assembly Compare and contrast student - generated and canonical ideas Enable student engagement through group presentations and students’ participation ; teachers act as facilitators , paraphrasing student explanations , and drawing attention to critical features Create a safe space to explore the affordances and constraints of student - generated RSMs with a view of improving upon them , and not assessing them as correct or incorrect 8 8 15 Productive Failure Tasks Targeted Concepts Targeted Levels Average Speed Secondary ( 7 th grade ) Standard Deviation Secondary ( 7 th , 8 th , 9 th grade ) Central Tendencies Secondary ( 7 th grade ) Normalization Pre - University 2 ( 11 th grade ) Hypothesis Testing Pre - University 3 ( 12 th grade ) Fractions Primary ( 3 rd grade ) 16 Central Tendencies ( Grade 7 students ) Which number represents each class ?
