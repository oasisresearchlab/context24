In contrast to the slow rate of depolymeriza - tion of pure actin in vitro , populations of actin filaments in vivo turn over rapidly . Therefore , the rate of actin depolymerization must be accelerated by one or more factors in the cell . Since the actin dynamics in Listeria monocytogenes tails bear many similarities to those in the lamellipodia of moving cells , we have used Listeria as a model system to isolate factors required for regu - lating the rapid actin filament turnover involved in cell migration . Using a cell - free Xenopus egg extract system to reproduce the Listeria movement seen in a cell , we depleted candidate depolymerizing proteins and ana - lyzed the effect that their removal had on the morphol - ogy of Listeria tails . Immunodepletion of Xenopus actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / cofilin ( XAC ) from Xenopus egg extracts resulted in Listeria tails that were approximately five times longer than the tails from un - depleted extracts . Depletion of XAC did not affect the tail assembly rate , suggesting that the increased tail length was caused by an inhibition of actin filament de - polymerization . Immunodepletion of Xenopus gelsolin had no effect on either tail length or assembly rate . Ad - dition of recombinant wild - type XAC or chick ADF protein to XAC - depleted extracts restored the tail length to that of control extracts , while addition of mu - tant ADF S3E that mimics the phosphorylated , inactive form of ADF did not reduce the tail length . Addition of excess wild - type XAC to Xenopus egg extracts reduced the length of Listeria tails to a limited extent . These ob - servations show that XAC but not gelsolin is essential for depolymerizing actin filaments that rapidly turn over in Xenopus extracts . We also show that while the depolymerizing activities of XAC and Xenopus extract are effective at depolymerizing normal filaments con - taining ADP , they are unable to completely depolymer - ize actin filaments containing AMPPNP , a slowly hy - drolyzible ATP analog . This observation suggests that the substrate for XAC is the ADP - bound subunit of ac - tin and that the lifetime of a filament is controlled by its nucleotide content . A ctin polymerization is required for many cellular movements such as protrusion of the leading edge of the cell and intracellular movement of the pathogen , Listeria monocytogenes ( Cooper , 1991 ; Bray and White , 1988 ; Sanger et al . , 1992 ; Mitchison and Cramer , 1996 ) . To maintain continuous polymerization during such movements , actin must be depolymerized and the subunits recycled . The intrinsic disassembly rates of pure filamen - tous actin ( F - actin ) 1 measured in vitro ( 0 . 044 – 1 . 14 (cid:109) m / min ) ( Pollard , 1986 ) cannot account for the depolymeriza - tion rates found in the cell ( up to 9 (cid:109) m / min ) ( Theriot and Mitchison , 1991 ; Zigmond , 1993 ; Small et al . , 1995 ) . There - fore , one or more factors must catalyze actin depolymer - ization in vivo . Such factors could act by increasing the dis - sociation rate from existing ends , by severing to increase the number of ends , or by a combination of both mecha - nisms . To date , severing proteins have been best charac - terized . Two classes of actin - severing proteins exist in most eu - karyotic cells : the gelsolin family and a family of small sev - ering proteins closely related in sequence and function that include actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) and cofi - lin . Structurally , these small proteins have a remarkable similarity to a single segment of the six repeated segments of gelsolin ( Hatanaka et al . , 1996 ) . Both classes of severing proteins have been studied biochemically and much is known about their in vitro behavior and regulation . The gelsolin class of proteins includes tissue - specific isoforms such as villin ( Pringault et al . , 1986 ) , scinderin ( Rodriguez Address all correspondence to Jody Rosenblatt , Department of Biochem - istry , University of California , San Francisco , San Francisco , CA 94143 .

The molecu - lar mass of gelsolin family members varies from 40 – 93 kD depending on the species or cell type . Gelsolin has strong actin - severing activity and can also cap the barbed end of actin filaments and nucleate filament formation . The activ - ity of gelsolin is regulated positively by Ca 2 (cid:49) binding and inhibited by binding polyphosphoinositides ( PIPs ) ( Janmey and Stossel , 1987 ) . The small actin - severing proteins include ADF ( Bam - burg et al . , 1980 ) and cofilin ( Nishida et al . , 1984 ) , as well as a number of species - specific isoforms ( for review see Moon and Drubin , 1995 ) . The ADFs have molecular masses ranging from 17 – 19 kD and the cofilins from 15 – 19 kD de - pending upon species type . The sequences of ADF and co - filin are (cid:122) 70 % identical to each other . Because of their similarities in sequence and function , members of either are often termed the ADF / cofilin family of proteins . While higher eukaryotes such as mammals and chicken contain both ADF and cofilin in their genomes , it is believed that all eukaryotes contain at least one copy of an ADF / cofilin protein ( Moon and Drubin , 1995 ) . Recently two proteins have been isolated from Xenopus laevis whose amino acid sequences are 77 % identical to chick cofilin , 66 % identical to chick ADF , and 93 % identical to each other ( Abe et al . , 1996 ) . These proteins have been named Xenopus ADF / co - filin 1 and 2 ( XAC 1 and 2 ) since their sequence is inter - mediate between ADF and cofilin . Because of their high sequence homology and similar patterns of temporal and spatial expression , XAC 1 and 2 are thought to be allelic variants encoded by the pseudotetraploid Xenopus laevis genome . Thus far , the XACs exhibit the same biochemical prop - erties as other members of the ADF / cofilin family . ADF / cofilin family proteins can bind F - actin at pH 6 . 8 and de - polymerize F - actin at pH 8 . 0 ( Yonezawa et al . , 1985 ; Haw - kins et al . , 1993 ; Hayden et al . , 1993 ) . ADF / cofilin proteins also bind monomeric actin ( G - actin ) ( Hayden et al . , 1993 ) . However , their depolymerizing activity is thought to be derived from their ability to sever F - actin and not from their ability to bind and sequester G - actin ( Maciver et al . , 1991 ) . The severing activity of ADF / cofilin proteins is much weaker than that of gelsolin in quantitative assays . The rel - ative weakness of severing by ADF / cofilin may be ex - plained by the fact that they preferentially sever at preex - isting bends in filaments , whereas gelsolin induces bends and breaks at any point on the filament ( Maciver et al . , 1991 ) . The activity of cofilin can be inhibited by tropomyo - sins ( Bernstein and Bamburg , 1982 ; Bamburg and Ber - stein , 1991 ) and PIPs ( Yonezawa et al . , 1990 ) . ADF / cofilin proteins in the cell are either unphosphorylated or phos - phorylated on a serine near the NH 2 terminus ( S3 in chick ADF ) ( Morgan et al . , 1993 ; Agnew et al . , 1995 ; Moriyama et al . , 1996 ) . The phosphorylated form has greatly reduced actin binding and depolymerizing activity . Several signal transduction pathways that cause reorganization of the ac - tin cytoskeleton also cause rapid dephosphorylation of ADF and cofilin ( for review see Moon and Drubin , 1995 ) , suggesting that ADF / cofilin dephosphorylation may be important for regulating actin depolymerization in the cell . Although biochemical studies show that gelsolin has stronger severing activity than the ADF / cofilin proteins , genetic studies of these two families have more strongly implicated ADF / cofilin proteins in the control of the actin cytoskeleton . Cofilin is an essential protein in Saccharo - myces cerevisiae ( Moon et al . , 1993 ) , Drosophila melano - gaster ( Gunsalus et al . , 1995 ) , and Caenorhabditis elegans ( McKim et al . , 1994 ) . In addition , ADF and cofilin localize to the cleavage furrow of dividing cells and have been shown to be essential for cytokinesis ( Gunsalus et al . , 1995 ; Nagaoka et al . , 1995 ; Abe et al . , 1996 ) . In contrast , the knockout of gelsolin in Dictyostelium ( André et al . , 1989 ) produced no obvious phenotype . Fibroblasts and neutrophils from gelsolin - deficient mice migrated more slowly than those from wild - type mice ( Witke et al . , 1995 ) . However , the viability of animals lacking gelsolin in the above studies may be due to compensation by other pro - teins that are functionally redundant to gelsolin . Despite a combination of biochemical and genetic analyses , a clear role is lacking for either the ADF / cofilin or gelsolin classes of proteins in controlling the rapid depolymerization of ac - tin filaments essential for lamellipodial protrusion and Listeria movement . The half - life of actin polymer in Listeria tails is similar to that observed in the lamellipodia of moving cells ( The - riot et al . , 1992 ) , suggesting that the depolymerization of actin filaments in Listeria tails may be a good model for turnover in other dynamic actin arrays . Concentrated Xe - nopus egg extracts can support the movement of Listeria monocytogenes at rates comparable to intact cell cyto - plasm ( Theriot et al . , 1994 ) and can provide a system in which to dissect biochemically the components required for actin - based motility and actin dynamics . To determine if any of the known severing proteins are responsible for rapid turnover of actin filaments in the cell , we immuno - depleted gelsolin and XAC from Xenopus egg extracts and tested whether the rapid polymerization and depoly - merization seen in Listeria tails were perturbed . Materials and Methods Preparation of Recombinant Proteins and Xenopus Egg Extracts The COOH - terminal 1 , 393 bp ( 464 amino acids ) of X . l . gelsolin was cloned by PCR from a (cid:108) - YES ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) Xenopus egg and embryo cDNA library ( gift from Jeremy Minshull ) ( Kinoshita et al . , 1995 ) into a pGEX - 2T vector ( Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc . , Piscataway , NJ ) . XAC 2 was cloned into a pGEX expression vector as described by Abe et al . ( 1996 ) . The pGEX expression plasmids were transformed into TG1 , and recombinant proteins were expressed and purified on a glu - tathione column using standard procedures ( Smith and Johnson , 1988 ) . For use in the addback experiments or for purification of antibodies , the glutathione S – transferase ( GST ) - fusion proteins were cleaved with 0 . 4 mg / ml thrombin ( Sigma Chemical Co . , St . Louis , MO ) in thrombin buffer ( 100 mM NaCl , 50 mM Tris HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 2 . 5 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT ) at 37 (cid:56) C for 60 min . Thrombin was then removed by passing the cleaved protein over a p - aminobenzamidine Sepharose ( Sigma Chemical Co . ) column in thrombin buffer and concentrating the flow through a cen - triprep - 10 concentrator ( Amicon , Beverly , MA ) . Xenopus egg extracts were made as described in Theriot et al . ( 1994 ) . Briefly , after dejellying meiotically arrested Xenopus laevis eggs in 2 % cys - teine , pH 7 . 8 , the eggs were washed 4 (cid:51) in 250 ml of XB ( 100 mM KCl , 10 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 7 , 50 mM sucrose , 5 mM EGTA , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 ) , transferred to 5 - ml tubes containing 50 (cid:109) l 0 . 5 M EGTA , 5 (cid:109) l 1 M MgCl 2 , 5 (cid:109) l 1 , 000 (cid:51) protease inhibitor mix ( 10 mg / ml leupeptin , pepstatin , and chymostatin in DMSO ) , and crushed at 10 , 000 rpm in an HB - 4 rotor Rosenblatt et al . Actin Filament Turnover in Listeria Tails 1325 ( Sorvall Instruments , Newtown , CT ) at 15 (cid:56) C . The cytoplasmic layer was removed with a 20 - gauge needle and syringe and 1 / 20 volume of energy mix ( 150 mM creatine phosphate , 20 mM ATP , 2 mM EGTA , pH 7 . 7 , and 20 mM MgCl 2 ) was added . Aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at (cid:50) 80 (cid:56) C for up to 6 mo . Preparation of Anti - XAC and Antigelsolin Antibodies GST fusion proteins with XAC 2 or gelsolin fragments expressed in Es - cherichia coli were used for rabbit antibody production ( Berkeley Anti - body Co . , Berkeley , CA ) . The antibodies were affinity purified on pure XAC or gelsolin cleaved with thrombin from the corresponding GST - fusion proteins expressed in E . coli . Antibodies were affinity purified us - ing published procedures ( Harlow and Lane , 1988 ) . Antibodies were eluted from the affinity column with 100 mM glycine , pH 2 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , neutralized , and dialyzed against 10 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 7 , 100 mM KCl , concentrated using Aquacide II , and redialyzed against 10 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 7 , 100 mM KCl . Immunofluorescence XL177 cells were grown on glass coverslips to (cid:122) 60 % confluency . Cells were infected with the Listeria monocytogenes strain 10403S as described ( Theriot et al . , 1994 ) except that (cid:122) 10 - fold more Listeria were used , and the cells were incubated for 8 h at 23 (cid:56) C ( 4 h before and 4 h after gentamy - cin addition ) before processing . Coverslips were rinsed in TBS ( 20 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl ) before fixation in 4 % formaldehyde in TBS for 20 min . The coverslips were rinsed in TBS before cells were permeabi - lized in TBS (cid:49) 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 for 10 min . After blocking for 10 min in AbDil ( TBS (cid:49) 2 % BSA and 0 . 5 % Na azide ) , the coverslips were incu - bated for 30 min with either 2 (cid:109) g / ml anti - XAC or 6 (cid:109) g / ml antigelsolin an - tibodies in AbDil . Texas red – conjugated goat anti – rabbit secondary anti - body was used to visualize gelsolin and XAC , and fluorescein - phalloidin ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) was used to visualize actin . Coverslips were mounted with FITC - guard ( Testog Inc . , Chicago , IL ) . Immunodepletion 100 (cid:109) g random rabbit IgG ( Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp . , Westbury , NY ) , anti - XAC antibody , or antigelsolin antibody was bound to 30 (cid:109) l Affiprep protein A ( BioRad Labs , Hercules , CA ) in TBST for 1 h at 4 (cid:56) C . The pellets were washed with 3 (cid:51) 1 ml XB and then incubated with 50 (cid:109) l crude cytostatic factor – arrested Xenopus egg extracts for 1 h at 4 (cid:56) C on a rotator . The pellet was removed by centrifuging at 10 , 000 g in an Ep - pendorf centrifuge for 20 s . The supernatant was removed and treated as the immunodepleted extract . The pellets were washed 3 (cid:51) 1 ml in TBST , boiled in sample buffer , and analyzed by SDS - PAGE . Western blots were performed by transferring SDS - PAGE gels electro - phoretically to nitrocellulose in 20 mM Tris , 25 mM glycine , 20 % metha - nol . Blots were incubated 1 h in AbDil followed by 1 h of incubation in 2 . 5 (cid:109) g / ml antigelsolin or anti - XAC antibody in AbDil at room temperature . Alkaline phosphatase – conjugated anti - rabbit antibody was used as a sec - ondary antibody ( Promega Corp . , Madison , WI ) . The amount of gelsolin or XAC depleted from extracts was determined using densitometry of im - munoblots by comparing the band intensity of 1 (cid:109) l of depleted extract to the band intensities of serially diluted undepleted extracts . Immunoblots were digitized using a scanner ( model Power Look ; UMAX Systems , Hsinchu , Taiwan ) and analyzed using Adobe Photoshop ( Adobe Systems Inc . , Mountain View , CA ) . Purified XAC and ADF as well as the immu - noprecipitates were visualized by staining with 0 . 25 % Coomassie blue R - 250 in 45 % methanol and 10 % acetic acid followed by destaining in 25 % methanol and 7 % acetic acid . Listeria Tail Assay Listeria monocytogenes strain SLCC - 5764 ( Leimeister - Wachter and Chakraborty , 1989 ) was grown overnight at 37 (cid:56) C with constant shaking to stationary phase in brain – heart infusion broth ( BHI ; Difco Laboratories Inc . , Detroit , MI ) . The Listeria were killed by adding 10 mM iodoacetic acid and incubating for 20 min at room temperature ( Theriot et al . , 1994 ) . The bacteria were washed once in XB , resuspended in 1 / 5 original volume in 20 % glycerol / XB , and stored at (cid:50) 80 (cid:56) C . Rabbit skeletal muscle actin co - valently labeled with N - hydroxysuccinimidyl 5 - carboxytetramethyl rhoda - mine ( Molecular Probes Inc . ) was made as previously described ( Rosen - blatt et al . , 1995 ) . Listeria tail morphology and Listeria motility were assayed by mixing 5 (cid:109) l of depleted or undepleted extract with 0 . 5 (cid:109) l each of Listeria and 1 mg / ml rhodamine - labeled actin . In experiments where XAC or ADF proteins were added , XB or proteins were added in a volume of 0 . 5 (cid:109) l . 1 (cid:109) l of this mixture was removed and squashed between a microscope slide and a 22 - mm 2 coverslip and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 25 min . Static images or movies of tails were collected using a CCD camera ( Prince - ton Instruments , Trenton , NJ ) and fluorescence movies of bacterial motil - ity were acquired using a video camera ( model SIT ; Dage - MTI , Inc . , Wa - bash , MI ) , respectively , during a period of 25 – 60 min after transferring reactions to room temperature . The lengths of tails and total tail fluores - cence were quantitated using Winview software ( Princeton Instruments , Trenton , NJ ) . Tail lengths were measured using the program Get Curve ( Princeton Instruments ) , and the length in pixels was converted to mi - crons using a micrometer standard . Total fluorescence in the Listeria tails was measured by multiplying the pixel area by average pixel intensity of a selected area minus the average pixel intensity of a background selected area . The CCD camera responds linearly to fluorescence intensity in the range of 10 – 3 , 000 counts / pixel , and we used illumination levels that avoided saturating the signal . Production and Depolymerization of AMPPNP Actin Filaments ATP or AMPPNP actin filaments were made by diluting rhodamine - labeled actin in G - buffer ( 5 mM Tris HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM DTT ) containing either 0 . 2 mM ATP or 0 . 2 mM AMPPNP to a final con - centration of 12 . 8 (cid:109) M in 100 (cid:109) l . The mixtures were either passed by grav - ity or spun through 1 ml G - 25 ( Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology , Inc . ) col - umns preequilibrated in G - buffer plus the 0 . 2 mM of the appropriate nucleotide for 1 min in a clinical centrifuge at mid - speed into tubes con - taining 25 (cid:109) l 0 . 25 M KCl , 0 . 25 M Tris , pH 8 . 0 , and 1 (cid:109) l 0 . 1 M of the appro - priate nucleotide and incubated for 30 min at room temperature . Filamen - tous actin was recovered by centrifuging the actin for 15 min at 436 , 000 g in a centrifuge ( model TLA100 ; Beckman Instrs . , Palo Alto , CA ) and re - suspending the pellet in 100 (cid:109) l F - buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 50 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 0 . 5 mM ATP or AMPPNP ) . Nucleotide incorporation was analyzed by centrifuging the various F - actin preparations through a 600 (cid:109) l 40 % glycerol F - buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 50 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM DTT ) cushion at 436 , 000 g in a table top cen - trifuge ( model TLA100 ; Beckman Instrs . ) for 60 min . The pellet was re - suspended in 50 (cid:109) l 8 M urea for 15 min at room temperature and then di - luted with 100 (cid:109) l of H 2 O and spun through a 10 - kD cut - off filter ( Millipore Corp . , Bedford , MA ) . The nucleotides in the filtrate were then analyzed by HPLC on a 1 ml Mono Q column ( Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology , Inc . ) equilibrated in 100 mM NH 4 HCO 3 and eluted in a 100 – 500 mM NH 4 HCO 3 gradient over 30 min at a flow rate of 1 ml / min . Peak areas were an - alyzed and recorded at OD 254 using Gilson software ( Worthington , OH ) . The ATP - or AMPPNP - containing F - actin was then mixed 1 : 1 with F - buffer , 0 . 1 mg / ml recombinant XAC , or crude cytostatic factor – arrested Xenopus egg extracts . Remaining filaments from the above mixtures were visualized on the microscope and quantitated by fluorimetry . Images of the above reactions were recorded by squashing 1 (cid:109) l of each reaction be - tween a microscope slide and a 22 - mm 2 coverslip using a microscope ( Ni - kon , Inc . , Melville , NY ) , a CCD camera , and Winview software . After in - cubating the F - actins with buffer , XAC , or extract for 10 min at room temperature , the remaining F - actin in the mixture was pelleted at 436 , 000 g for 15 min at 4 (cid:56) C in a centrifuge ( model TLA100 ; Beckman Instrs . ) . The pellets were resuspended in 0 . 1 % SDS and the fluoresence was measured on a fluorimeter ( model Aminco ; SLM Instruments , Inc . , Urbana , IL ) . Per - cent remaining F - actin was calculated as the fluorescence of XAC - or ex - tract - treated pellet / fluorescence of buffer - treated pellet . Results Localization of XAC and Gelsolin in Listeria Actin Tails Since we suspected that severing proteins might accelerate actin turnover in Listeria tails , we examined the localiza - tion of two candidate actin - severing proteins , gelsolin and XAC , in Listeria - infected Xenopus tissue culture cells ( XL 177 ) . Antibodies were raised to the COOH - terminal half The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 136 , 1997 1326 of Xenopus laevis gelsolin ( Ankenbauer et al . , 1988 ) and to the full - length XAC 2 protein ( Abe et al . , 1996 ) and affinity purified . Since XAC 1 and 2 differ by only four amino acids , we made only antibodies to XAC 2 , which should also recognize XAC 1 . Immunoblots of XL 177 ly - sate show that antibodies to gelsolin and XAC recognize a single band of the expected molecular mass in both cases ( Fig . 1 A , lanes 2 and 3 ) . Fluorescein - labeled phalloidin and affinity - purified antibodies to XAC or gelsolin were used to visualize the intracellular distributions of F - actin ( Fig . 1 , B and D ) , gelsolin ( Fig . 1 C ) , and XAC ( Fig . 1 E ) in XL 177 cells infected with Listeria monocytogenes . Both XAC and gelsolin colocalize with the F - actin staining in the Listeria tails . Both gelsolin and XAC antibodies also give punctate staining throughout the rest of the cell . In addition , gelsolin typically stained coincidentally with F - actin in the stress fibers of the cell , whereas XAC does not . XAC Is Required for the Depolymerization of Actin in Listeria Tails To determine the function of gelsolin and XAC in Listeria tails , we compared Listeria tails in mock - depleted Xeno - pus egg extracts to those in extracts depleted of XAC or gelsolin . Using our antibodies complexed to protein A beads , we were able to remove the bulk of either protein from Xenopus egg extracts . Quantitative immunoblots show that (cid:122) 75 % of XAC ( Fig . 2 B , lane 2 ) and (cid:46) 95 % of gelsolin ( Fig . 2 A , lane 3 ) were depleted from extracts compared to random rabbit IgG – depleted extracts ( Fig . 2 , A and B , lane 1 ) . The XAC antibody precipitated XAC ( 19 kD ) and an unknown band with an approximate mo - lecular mass of 28 kD ( Fig . 2 C , lane 2 ) . The gelsolin anti - body precipitated only gelsolin ( (cid:122) 93 kD ) ( Fig . 2 C , lane 3 ) when compared to the rabbit IgG control pellet ( lane 1 ) . The IgG control depletion ( Fig . 3 A ) produced Listeria tails of the same length as untreated extract ( 15 (cid:54) 2 . 5 and 18 (cid:54) 1 . 5 (cid:109) m , respectively ) . The tails in the gelsolin - depleted extracts ( Fig . 3 B ) were the same length and con - tained the same polymer mass as those of the IgG - depleted extracts ( Fig . 3 A ) . However , the tails formed in the XAC - depleted extracts ( Fig . 3 C ) were on the average four to six times longer and displayed 13 – 21 - fold more to - tal fluorescence than those of the control extracts . Add - back of pure recombinant XAC ( Fig . 3 D ) or chicken ADF to approximately endogenous concentrations ( 2 . 7 (cid:109) M ) res - cued the long tail phenotype ( 12 . 3 (cid:54) 1 . 4 and 11 . 4 (cid:54) 1 . 6 (cid:109) m , respectively ) . Addition of the same amount of a re - combinant mutant version of ADF ( S3E ADF ) ( Fig . 3 E ) , which behaves like constitutively phosphorylated ADF and has (cid:122) 10 % of wild - type ADF activity on pure actin ( data not shown ) , does not rescue the long tail phenotype . The purity of the proteins used in the addback experiment ( Fig . 2 D , lanes 1 and 2 ) and the inability of the S3E ADF to rescue the XAC depletion phenotype strongly suggest that the observed long tail phenotype is due to the re - moval of XAC . The graph in Fig . 3 F shows the quantita - tion of the tail lengths and the amounts of tail fluorescence of the different phenotypes and provides quantitative sup - port for our conclusion that increased tail length is due to XAC depletion , and not depletion of some other protein . These experiments demonstrate that XAC is required for the rapid depolymerization of actin filaments in Listeria tails in Xenopus extracts . While gelsolin is also concen - trated within these tails , it does not appear to be essential for the depolymerization of Listeria tail actin . Figure 1 .

Actin Filament Turnover in Listeria Tails 1327 Addition of Excess XAC Decreases Listeria Tail Length Quantitative immunoblots of Xenopus egg extracts using XAC antibodies and bacterially expressed XAC as a stan - dard revealed that XAC is present at (cid:122) 2 . 1 (cid:109) M in extracts ( data not shown ) . Addition of recombinant XAC to a final concentration of 7 . 1 (cid:109) M in the extract ( Fig . 4 B ) produced tails that were (cid:122) 0 . 33 times the length and had ninefold less total fluorescence than tails in a control extract ( Fig . 4 D ) . Doubling the amount of XAC added to the Listeria assay to give a final concentration of 12 . 1 (cid:109) M did not result in any further decrease in tail length ( Fig . 4 , C and D ) . When XAC was added to concentrations above 12 . 1 (cid:109) M final concentration , few tails formed . Instead , rodlike structures containing rhodamine actin could be seen throughout the extract ( data not shown ) . These rods appear analogous to those seen when actin and cofilin are concentrated in the nucleus upon heat shock or DMSO treatment to cells ( Nishida et al . , 1987 ; Ono et al . , 1993 ) and probably repre - sent a nonfilamentous coaggregate of XAC and actin . It is likely that few tails can form in such high concentrations of XAC since the actin required for Listeria tail formation may be sequestered in these XAC / actin rodlike aggre - gates . Thus , a Listeria tail segment of (cid:122) 5 (cid:109) m is resistant to XAC depolymerization even when XAC is added up to nearly saturating concentrations . The Effect of XAC on Listeria Movement Rate To determine whether the addition or depletion of XAC or gelsolin had an effect on the rate of actin polymeriza - tion , we measured the rate of Listeria movement in ex - tracts either depleted of XAC or gelsolin , or containing additional XAC ( Fig . 5 ) . We used Listeria movement as an assay since the movement rate reflects the actin polymer - ization rate at the bacterial surface ( Sanger et al . , 1992 ; Theriot et al . , 1992 ) . The rate of Listeria movement in the XAC depleted extracts did not vary greatly from the mock - depleted extracts . The lack of effect that XAC - deple - tion had on actin assembly rates may indicate that XAC is not involved in actin polymerization . However , we cannot rule out such an involvement since only 75 % of the XAC could be removed from the extracts with our reagents . De - pletion of gelsolin increased the rate of Listeria movement by (cid:122) 1 (cid:109) m / min ( (cid:122) 20 % ) . The manipulations required for depletion slowed Listeria movement by (cid:122) 1 (cid:109) m / min ( com - pare IgG - depleted to addition of buffer ) . This may be due to a decrease of ATP , dilution of actin , or other factors dur - ing the depletion procedure ( 2 – 3 h at 4 (cid:56) C ) . Addition of XAC to 5 . 0 (cid:109) M seemed to increase the rate of polymeriza - tion by (cid:122) 1 (cid:109) m / min compared to when buffer alone is added , despite the shorter tails produced by this concen - tration ( Fig . 4 B ) . These slight differences cannot account for the large changes in tail length and total fluorescence upon XAC depletion . Thus , the effects of XAC on actin depolymerization greatly outweigh those upon polymer - ization . XAC Depolymerization Activity Depends upon the Nucleotide Content of the Filament Upon polymerization , actin hydrolyzes its bound ATP and the terminal phosphate is slowly released . It has been sug - gested that the loss of the terminal phosphate could serve as a clock that regulates the lifetime of a filament by con - trolling the activity of ADF / cofilin proteins ( Maciver et al . , 1991 ; Moon and Drubin , 1995 ) . To test this hypothesis , we made rhodamine - labeled actin filaments containing AMP - PNP , a slowly hydrolyzable ATP analog , and tested their resistance to the depolymerizing activities of Xenopus egg extracts and purified XAC . Rhodamine ATP - actin fila - ments depolymerize rapidly in the presence of XAC ( Fig . 6 C ) and Xenopus egg extract ( Fig . 6 E ) compared to buffer ( Fig . 6 A ) . In contrast , rhodamine - labeled AMP - PNP filaments depolymerized to a limited extent in XAC ( Fig . 6 D ) or Xenopus egg extract ( Fig . 6 F ) compared to in buffer alone ( Fig . 6 B ) . Thus , AMPPNP filaments were more stable to depolymerization in XAC or extract ( Fig 6 , D and F ) compared to ATP filaments under the same con - ditions ( Fig . 6 , C and E ) . To quantitate actin filament de - Figure 2 . Gels of immunode - pletion of XAC and gelsolin from Xenopus laevis egg ex - tracts and purified XAC and ADF .

The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 136 , 1997 1328 polymerization , rhodamine - labeled filaments were added to Xenopus extracts or purified XAC and total polymer - ized actin was recovered by sedimentation . The fraction of the added actin left in polymer was determined by resus - pending the pellets in SDS and quantitating the fluores - cence with a fluorimeter ( Fig . 6 G ) . AMPPNP caused twice as much of the added F - actin to be recovered in the pellet fraction . Comparing Fig . 6 , E and F , with G , we should note that the visual and sedimentation assays are measur - ing different parameters . If the labeled actin repolymer - ized into new filaments in the presence of extract , the fila - ments will not be visible to the CCD camera because they are diluted with endogenous actin ( Fig . 6 , E and F ) . How - ever the diluted actin will still sediment , giving rise to the high fraction of label in the pellet fraction in the presence of extract ( Fig . 6 G , Xenopus extract ) . Both types of assay demonstrate that the AMPPNP filaments are relatively re - sistant to depolymerization by pure XAC and total extract . Two other slowly hydrolyzable ATP analogs , ATP (cid:103) S and AMPPCP , showed similar stabilizing effects ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the actin stability is due to the state of the bound nucleotide rather than nonspecific effects on actin structure . The results from both the microscopy and the fluorimetry assays suggest that the nucleotide content of actin filaments regulates XAC . Incorporation of AMPPNP into actin filaments in these experiments was modest ; (cid:122) 12 % of the ATP - binding sites in actin filaments incorporated AMPPNP , and the remain - der contained ADP . By contrast , ATP actin filaments contained approximately only 2 % ATP and 98 % ADP . Despite low incorporation , (cid:122) 1 . 5 and 2 times as much AMPPNP - containing actin filaments as ATP - containing actin filaments pelleted in the presence of Xenopus extract or pure XAC , respectively . Discussion We have used the ability to reconstitute Listeria motility in Xenopus egg extracts to test directly the role of the gelso - lin and ADF / cofilin proteins in the promotion of actin fila - ment depolymerization . We have raised specific antibod - ies to gelsolin and to XAC , the major ADF / cofilin protein known to be present in Xenopus egg extracts . Using im - munodepletions and adding back purified proteins , our Figure 3 . Listeria tail formed in XAC - or gelsolin - depleted Xeno - pus egg extracts .

Actin Filament Turnover in Listeria Tails 1329 studies demonstrate that ADF / cofilin is the major factor responsible for the rapid turnover of actin filaments in Listeria tails . Removal of 75 % of the ADF / cofilin from ex - tracts considerably lengthened Listeria tails and greatly in - creased the total actin polymer mass present in the tails . Both tail length and actin polymer mass in tails were re - stored to control levels by adding back pure XAC at phys - iological concentrations to XAC - depleted extracts . In ad - dition , adding excess XAC shortens Listeria tails and reduces the polymer mass in the tail , and AMPPNP actin is resistant to depolymerization by both XAC and whole extracts . Taken together , these data strongly implicate XAC as a central component of the machinery responsible for rapid actin filament turnover in extracts . Although we have no direct evidence , we predict that ADF / cofilin pro - teins are required for the dynamic organization of popula - tions of actin filaments within living cells that turn over rapidly , such as the filaments within lamellipodia . Three arguments support our prediction : Xenopus egg extracts can support the actin polymerization and depolymeriza - tion in Listeria tails at rates comparable to those in intact cells and suggest they reflect the actin dynamics within cell cytoplasm . XAC is required to maintain the turnover of actin filaments in these tails in extracts . Because ADF / co - filin proteins are essential in every species in which they have been found , we may infer that they are required for essential processes like rapid actin turnover in the cell . Fi - nally , since XAC is concentrated in Listeria tails and the leading edge of cells , we suspect it is also required for rapid filament turnover in vivo . In contrast to XAC , gelsolin depletions had no signifi - cant effect on Listeria tail length or tail polymer mass , leaving the functional role of gelsolin in the regulation of actin dynamics an open question . Since gelsolin does not affect the depolymerization of Listeria tails , its concentra - tion in these tails is curious . Perhaps gelsolin is concen - trated in these tails strictly because of its actin binding ac - tivity , or by another of its activities such as actin capping . Although the Xenopus egg extracts used in our assays con - tain 5 mM EGTA , it is difficult to analyze any local con - centrations of Ca 2 (cid:49) that may be due to vesicle release . Since Ca 2 (cid:49) is required for gelsolin activity , it is possible that the conditions in our cell - free egg extracts are not able to support the activity of gelsolin . Therefore , we can - not rule out a role for gelsolin in tail dynamics in vivo . However , the presence of gelsolin in Listeria tails does not greatly affect actin assembly or disassembly in Listeria tails in Xenopus extracts . In our addition of varying amounts of excess XAC to ex - tracts until all the actin was driven into abnormal rod structures , Listeria tails shrank to (cid:122) 5 (cid:109) m but no further . The persistence of a resistant tail segment in up to sixfold the normal concentrations of XAC suggests that an addi - tional factor may control the extent of actin depolymeriza - tion by XAC . Several investigators have suggested that the energy of ATP hydrolysis could be used to regulate the lifetime of a filament ( Pollard , 1986 ; Carlier , 1988 ; Mac - iver et al . , 1991 ; Moon and Drubin , 1995 ) . In vitro studies of actin filament assembly have shown that upon polymer - ization of ATP - actin , the bound ATP is hydrolyzed and Figure 4 .

This slow rate of phosphate loss relative to the polymer - ization rate should then produce filaments that contain a segment of ADP (cid:49) inorganic phosphate ( ADP . Pi ) . Since ATP - and ADP . Pi - bound actin are known to make stron - ger intersubunit bonds than ADP - actin ( Carlier , 1991 ; Carlier et al . , 1985 ) , phosphate release could play a role in regulating actin filament stability . However , since in vitro filaments depolymerize very slowly , phosphate release alone is not sufficient to direct rapid disassembly of actin filaments in the cell . In vivo , perhaps the role of slow phos - phate release in actin is to regulate either the binding or activity of actin - severing proteins . Severing proteins such as ADF and cofilin may preferentially sever the ADP sub - units of actin filaments while the ATP and ADP . Pi sub - units are resistant to severing ( Fig . 7 ) . In support of this , the depolymerizing activity of actophorin , an Acan - thamoeba member of the ADF / cofilin family , can be inhib - ited by addition of 25 mM phosphate , which presumably mimics ADP . Pi filaments ( Maciver et al . , 1991 ) . In addi - tion , actophorin has been shown to bind tightly to ADP - containing G - actin and weakly to ATP - actin ( Maciver and Weeds , 1994 ) . However , other studies show that chick ADF has a higher affinity for ATP - actin than for ADP - actin ( Hayden et al . , 1993 ) and have left the role of the bound nucleotide in regulating depolymerization in other species an open question . Our results showing the resistance of AMPPNP - containing actin filaments to the depolymeriz - ing activities of both XAC and concentrated Xenopus egg extracts lend support to the idea that the nucleotide con - Figure 5 .

Actin Filament Turnover in Listeria Tails 1331 tent of an actin filament controls filament lifetime by regu - lating the activity of ADF / cofilin family members . What is the mechanism of actin depolymerization by XAC ? XAC could depolymerize by end - wise removal of subunits , by severing , or by both mechanisms . We inter - pret our results with AMPPNP actin as favoring the end - wise mechanism . We reason that a severing protein would not be greatly affected by an actin filament with only 12 % of its subunits substituted with AMPPNP . By contrast , an end - wise depolymerizing protein would be blocked when - ever AMPPNP subunits were present at the filament ends . Thus , the large inhibition of depolymerization by AMP - PNP filaments may be accounted for if XAC primarily depolymerized using an end - wise mechanism . The most direct way of distinguishing severing and end - wise mecha - nisms will come from imaging depolymerization by ADF / cofilin proteins . On the basis of our findings , we can postulate a model for how XAC recycles actin subunits in the Listeria tail ( Fig . 7 ) . A complex of proteins at the back of Listeria ( Welch et al . , 1997 ) induces polymerization of ATP - bound actin . Once actin polymerizes , the bound ATP is hydro - lyzed and the terminal phosphate is slowly released . The resulting ADP - containing actin subunits interact more weakly within the filament than the ATP subunits and al - low binding of XAC . XAC either depolymerizes single subunits or short fragments of filament . XAC is then re - leased from the depolymerized actin subunit and recycled for another round of depolymerization . The ADP in the depolymerized actin is then exchanged for ATP by bulk mass or by catalysis from profilin , and this subunit is now available for another round of polymerization or remains unpolymerized by binding thymosin (cid:98) 4 or other sequester - ing proteins . This model provides a framework for understanding how an actin subunit is recycled from one round of poly - merization to the next in regions of the cell that rapidly turn over actin filaments . Clearly , many questions remain regarding the details of this model . Future work will need to address whether XAC works primarily by severing or end - wise mechanisms in the cell . We are currently examin - ing how XAC is recycled for another round of depolymer - ization after it is bound to the actin subunit and the role that XAC phosphorylation may play in its recycling . Other studies will need to focus on how the actin subunit is recy - cled for repolymerization . Analysis of the nucleotide con - tent of actin has revealed that (cid:122) 90 % of unpolymerized ac - tin in the cell is bound to ATP ( Rosenblatt et al . , 1995 ) , suggesting that the actin nucleotide is exchanged early in the pathway . Information about whether the ATP - or ADP - bound actin is used for polymerization is still lack - ing . The 10 % of actin that is ADP bound could be bound to XAC . This population of actin could undergo nucle - otide exchange and be used directly for another round of polymerization , leaving the remaining 90 % of actin se - questered from polymerization . However , the lack of an effect that XAC depletion has on the rate of polymeriza - tion at early time points would suggest that this is not the case . Future studies will need to address what population of actin is used for polymerization .

We are indebted to Matt Welch and especially Arshad Desai and Michael Redd ( University of California at Figure 7 . Model for recycling of actin by ADF / cofilin pro - teins . At areas of high fila - ment turnover in the cell , ATP - bound actin is induced to polymerize by a complex of proteins . The ATP within the filament is hydrolyzed and the terminal phosphate is slowly released . The result - ing ADP - containing sub - units have weaker interac - tions with each other than those containing ATP . These subunits are now available for depolymeriza - tion by the ADF / cofilin fam - ily of proteins ( XAC ) . Once XAC depolymerizes an actin subunit ( s ) , it dissociates from actin . The released actin must exchange its ADP for ATP and the nucleotide ex - change is probably catalyzed by profilin . The ATP - bound actin is then either repoly - merized or sequestered for later use .
