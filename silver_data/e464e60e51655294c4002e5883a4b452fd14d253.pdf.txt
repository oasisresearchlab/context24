Regulation of membrane scission in 1 yeast endocytosis 2 Deepikaa Menon and Marko Kaksonen * 3 * For correspondence : Marko . Kaksonen @ unige . ch Department of Biochemistry and National Centre of Competence in Research , Chemical 4 Biology , University of Geneva , Geneva , Switzerland 5 Abstract During clathrin - mediated endocytosis , a flat plasma membrane is shaped into an 6 invagination that undergoes scission to form a vesicle . In mammalian cells , the force that drives the 7 transition from invagination to vesicle is primarily provided by the GTPase dynamin that acts in concert 8 with crescent - shaped BAR domain proteins . In yeast cells , the mechanism of endocytic scission is 9 unclear . The yeast BAR domain protein complex Rvs161 / 167 ( Rvs ) nevertheless plays an important role 10 in this process : deletion of Rvs dramatically reduces scission efficiency . A mechanistic understanding of 11 the influence of Rvs on scission however , remains incomplete . We used quantitative live - cell imaging 12 and genetic manipulation to understand the recruitment and function of Rvs and other late - stage 13 proteins at yeast endocytic sites . We found that arrival of Rvs at endocytic sites is timed by interaction 14 of its BAR domain with specific membrane curvature . A second domain of Rvs167 - the SH3 domain - 15 affects localization efficiency of Rvs . We show that Myo3 , one of the two type - I myosins in 16 Saccharomyces cerevisiae , has a role in recruiting Rvs167 via the SH3 domain . Removal of the SH3 17 domain also affects assembly and disassembly of actin and impedes membrane invagination . Our 18 results indicate that both BAR and SH3 domains are important for the role of Rvs as a regulator of 19 scission . We tested other proteins implicated in vesicle formation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae , and 20 found that neither synaptojanins nor dynamin contribute directly to membrane scission . We propose 21 that recruitment of Rvs BAR domains delays scission and allows invaginations to grow by stabilizing 22 them . We also propose that vesicle formation is dependent on the force exerted by the actin network 23 component of the endocytic machinery . 24 25 Introduction 26 Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is a process by which cargo molecules from the cell exterior are incor - 27 porated into a clathrin - coated vesicle that is then transported into the cell . Over 50 different proteins 28 are involved in formation of an endocytic vesicle ( McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ; Kaksonen and Roux , 29 2018 ) . The molecular mechanisms mediating endocytic vesicle formation are largely conserved between 30 yeast and mammals . Most yeast endocytic proteins have homologues in mammals . These proteins 31 establish endocytic sites , recruit cargo , bend the membrane into an invagination , and finally separate the 32 endocytic vesicle from the plasma membrane ( Kaksonen and Roux , 2018 ) . Actin filaments play a critical 33 role in membrane - shaping in yeast . The filaments are nucleated and polymerize to form a branched 34 actin network , which is required for bending the membrane into stereotypical tubular invaginations 35 ( Kübler et al . , 1993 ; Kukulski et al . , 2012 ) . How the final stage of membrane scission is effected in yeast 36 1 of 24 remains unclear . In mammalian cells , the forces that drive the final transition from invagination to 37 spherical vesicle are largely provided by the GTPase dynamin ( Grigliatti et al . , 1973 ; Takei et al . , 1995 ; 38 Sweitzer and Hinshaw , 1998 ; Ferguson et al . , 2007 ; Galli et al . , 2017 ) . Dynamin interacts via its proline - 39 rich domain with the SH3 domains of crescent - shaped N - BAR proteins like Endophilin and Amphiphysin 40 ( Grabs et al . , 1997 ; Cestra et al . , 1999 ; Farsad et al . , 2001 ; Ferguson et al . , 2009 ; Meinecke et al . , 2013 ) . 41 Conformational changes of dynamin recruited to N - BAR molecules cause constriction of the underlying 42 invaginated membrane , resulting in vesicle formation ( Shupliakov et al . , 1997 ; Zhang and Hinshaw , 43 2001 ; Zhao et al . , 2016 ) . 44 Three dynamin - like proteins : Dnm1 , Mgm1 , and Vps1 , have been identified in yeast . Dnm1 and Mgm1 45 are involved in mitochondrial fusion and fission ( Cerveny et al . , 2007 ) . The third , Vps1 , gets its name 46 from its essential role in vacuolar protein sorting in the secretory pathway ( Rothman et al . , 1989 , 1990 ) . 47 It is also involved in fission and fusion of vacuoles and peroxisomes ( Hoepfner et al . , 2001 ; Peters 48 et al . , 2004 ) , and is required for regulation of endosome to Golgi trafficking ( Gurunathan et al . , 2002 ) . 49 In addition , Vps1 has been reported to localize at endocytic sites on the plasma membrane , interact 50 with endocytic proteins like clathrin , and influence the lifetimes and recruitment of endocytic proteins 51 ( Yu and Cai , 2004 ; Nannapaneni et al . , 2010 ; Smaczynska - de Rooij et al . , 2012 ) . Others however , have 52 failed to observe Vps1 at endocytic sites ( Kishimoto et al . , 2011 ; Goud Gadila et al . , 2017 ) , or observe 53 a role in endocytic vesicle scission ( Nothwehr et al . , 1995 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ) . The role of Vps1 in 54 clathrin - mediated endocytosis thus remains debated . 55 A confirmed component of the yeast endocytic scission mechanism is the heterodimeric complex formed 56 by the N - BAR domain proteins Rvs161 and Rvs167 ( Munn et al . , 1995 ; D’Hondt et al . , 2000 ; Kaksonen 57 et al . , 2005 ; Kishimoto et al . , 2011 ) . The two Rvs proteins are homologues of the N - BAR proteins 58 Amphiphysin and Endophilin in animals ( Friesen et al . , 2006 ; Youn et al . , 2010 ) . Deletion of Rvs167 59 reduces scission efficiency by nearly 30 % and reduces the lengths to which endocytic invaginations 60 grow to nearly a third ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ; Kukulski et al . , 2012 ) . In endocytic events that fail to 61 undergo scission , the membrane first invaginates and then retracts back to the cell wall ( Kaksonen et al . , 62 2005 ) . Rvs167 and Rvs161 proteins form a canonical N - BAR domain which forms a crescent - shaped 63 structure ( Youn et al . , 2010 ) . This curved structure is thought to be the key functional domain of the 64 protein ( Sivadon et al . , 1997 ) . N - BAR domains are able to form lattices that can bind membrane with 65 their concave surfaces , and impose or sense curvature across dimensions larger than that of a single 66 BAR domain ( Farsad et al . , 2001 ; Peter et al . , 2004 ; Youn et al . , 2010 ; Mim et al . , 2012 ; Zhao et al . , 67 2013 ) . In addition to the N - BAR domain , Rvs167 has a Glycine - Proline - Alanine rich ( GPA ) region and a 68 C - terminal SH3 domain ( Sivadon et al . , 1997 ) . The GPA region is thought to act as a linker with no other 69 known function , while loss of the SH3 domain affects daughter cell budding and actin cytoskeleton 70 morphology ( Sivadon et al . , 1997 ) . The Rvs complex can tubulate liposomes in vitro , indicating that the 71 BAR domain can impose curvature on membranes ( Youn et al . , 2010 ) . However , Rvs arrives at endocytic 72 sites when membrane tubes are already formed ( Kukulski et al . , 2012 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ) . Therefore 73 curvature - sensing rather than curvature - generation is the likely role of the Rvs complex at endocytic 74 sites . Rvs molecules arrive at endocytic sites a few seconds before scission , and disassemble rapidly 75 at scission time ( Picco et al . , 2015 ) , consistent with a role in vesicle scission . However , a mechanistic 76 understanding of the role of Rvs in scission remains incomplete . 77 Synaptojanins are PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 phosphatases that have been implicated in endocytic scission , as well as 78 in intracellular signalling , and modulation of the actin cytoskeleton ( Singer - Krüger et al . , 1998 ) . They 79 interact with both dynamin and N - BAR proteins in mammalian cells ( McPherson et al . , 1996 ; Watanabe 80 et al . , 2018 ) . Disruption of these genes leads to accumulation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in cells ( Stolz et al . , 1998b ) . 81 In synaptojain - disrupted mouse cells , coated endocytic vesicles cluster at the plasma membrane , 82 2 of 24 demonstrating a role for lipid hydrolysis in vesicle uncoating ( Watanabe et al . , 2018 ) . In yeast , removal 83 of synaptojanin - like proteins affects rate of endocytosis , and induces aberrant behaviour of several 84 endocytic proteins ( Singer - Krüger et al . , 1998 ; Sun et al . , 2007 ; Kishimoto et al . , 2011 ) . 85 We aimed to identify roles and molecular mechanisms for proteins that have been implicated in 86 endocytic vesicle scission in yeast : Vps1 , synaptojanins , and the Rvs complex . We used quantitative 87 live - cell imaging and genetic manipulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to test the roles of these proteins 88 in endocytosis . We found evidence for a specific role in scission for the Rvs complex , but not for the 89 other candidate proteins . Furthermore , we analyzed the molecular mechanisms of recruitment and the 90 mode of action of Rvs in scission . 91 Results 92 Rvs167 , but not Vps1 , influences endocytic coat internalization 93 The role of the dynamin - like protein Vps1 in yeast endocytosis is unclear . Some studies have reported a 94 role for Vps1 in endocytic vesicle scission ( Yu and Cai , 2004 ; Nannapaneni et al . , 2010 ; Smaczynska - de 95 Rooij et al . , 2010 ) , while others have reported that Vps1 does not localize to endocytic sites or contribute 96 to scission ( Kishimoto et al . , 2011 ; Goud Gadila et al . , 2017 ) . Neither N - nor C - terminally tagged Vps1 97 co - localized with endocytic actin - binding protein Abp1 in our hands ( data not shown ) , consistent with 98 other work that observed localization only with the Golgi trafficking pathway ( Goud Gadila et al . , 2017 ) . 99 However , the question of whether or not Vps1 has a function at endocytic sites has been obfuscated by 100 potential tagging - induced dysfunction of Vps1 molecules . 101 In mammalian cells , dynamin interacts with N - BAR proteins to cause vesicle scission ( Grabs et al . , 1997 ; 102 Cestra et al . , 1999 ; Farsad et al . , 2001 ; Meinecke et al . , 2013 ) . Although the association between yeast 103 dynamin Vps1 and N - BAR protein Rvs is uncertain , Rvs is recruited to endocytic sites briefly before 104 scission and influences scission efficiency ( Kaksonen et al . , 2003 , 2005 ; Kukulski et al . , 2012 ; Picco et al . , 105 2015 ) . In order to determine the roles of these proteins in endocytic scission , we analyzed the behaviour 106 of other endocytic proteins in cells lacking Vps1 and Rvs167 , and compared against wild - type ( WT ) cells 107 ( Fig . 1A - F ) . 108 Vps1 gene deletion was confirmed by sequencing the gene locus . vps1 Δ cells showed a previously 109 reported slow growth phenotype at high temperatures ( Fig . S1A ) ( Rothman and Stevens , 1986 ) . In 110 order to quantify invagination progression , coat protein Sla1 tagged at the C - terminus with eGFP was 111 observed in yeast cells imaged at the equatorial plane ( Fig . 1A ) . Since membrane invagination progresses 112 perpendicularly to the plane of the plasma membrane , proteins that move into the cytoplasm during 113 invagination growth do so in the imaging plane . Upon actin polymerization , the endocytic coat moves 114 into the cytoplasm along with the membrane as it invaginates ( Skruzny et al . , 2012 ) . Movement of Sla1 115 thus acts as a proxy for the growth of the plasma membrane invagination . Membrane retraction , that 116 is , inward movement and subsequent retraction of the invaginated membrane back towards the cell 117 wall is a scission - specific phenotype ( Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ; Kishimoto et al . , 2011 ) . Retraction rates 118 were not significantly different in vps1 Δ cells compared to the WT ( Fig . 1B ) . 119 To follow invaginations in more detail , centroid trajectories of 30 - 50 Sla1 - eGFP patches in vps1 Δ and WT 120 cells were tracked and compared ( Fig . 1A - C ) . Centroids of Sla1 patches - each patch being an endocytic 121 site - were tracked in time and averaged . This provided an averaged centroid that could be followed 122 with high spatial and temporal precision ( Picco et al . , 2015 ) . Sla1 - eGFP was imaged simultaneously with 123 Abp1 - mCherry . Abp1 fluorescent intensity maximum in WT strains correlates with scission time and 124 3 of 24 maximum movement of the Sla1 centroid ( Fig . S1B ) ( Picco et al . , 2015 ) . The movement of the Sla1 - eGFP 125 centroid therefore corresponds to the growth of the endocytic membrane invagination and to the initial 126 diffusive movement of the vesicle after scission ( Kukulski et al . , 2012 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ) . The distance 127 that Sla1 centroid moves thus gives an indication of invagination and scission steps of endocytosis . Any 128 defects in scission are expected to chage the motility pattern of the Sla1 centroid . 129 2 µ m r v s 167 Δ W T v p s 1 Δ A .

All centroids were co - aligned with Abp1 - mCherry so that time = 0 s corresponds to Abp1 intensity maximum . On the y - axis , non - motile centroid position = 0 nm . Shading on plots show 95 % confidence intervals . Dashed red lines indicate Abp1 intensity maxima in respective strains . The movement of Sla1 - eGFP in WT cells was linear to about 150 nm ( Fig . 1C ) , consonant with maximum 130 invagination lengths measured by correlative light and electron microscopy ( CLEM ) ( Kukulski et al . , 131 2012 ) . Sla1 movement in vps1 Δ cells , also co - aligned with Abp1 - mCherry , was virtually identical to WT 132 cells ( Fig . 1C ) . The total movement - and so the length of endocytic invagination - was similar to WT . 133 Quantitative imaging has shown that scission is simultaneous with a sharp jump of the Rvs167 centroid 134 into the cytoplasm and a corresponding loss of fluorescent intensity ( Fig . 1 D , F , S1B ) ( Kukulski et al . , 135 2012 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ) . This jump is interpreted as loss of protein on the membrane tube at the time 136 of scission , causing an apparent jump of the centroid to proteins that remain localized on the newly 137 formed vesicle . Kymographs of Rvs167 - GFP ( Fig . 1A ) , as well as Rvs167 centroid tracking ( Fig . 1F ) in vps1 Δ 138 cells showed the same jump as in WT . We quantified the number of molecules of Rvs167 recruited 139 to endocytic sites in vps1 Δ cells ( Joglekar et al . , 2006 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ) , and found that it was not 140 significantly different from that recruited to WT cells ( Fig . 1D ) . We expect that a longer invagination is 141 likely to recruit either more molecules of Rvs167 or the same number of molecules distributed along a 142 4 of 24 longer invagination . Since we observe neither higher Rvs167 molecules numbers , nor larger invagination 143 lengths , we conclude that the membrane tube is the same length as in WT . These data further suggest 144 that the scission process is normal in vps1 Δ cells . 145 We next studied invagination progression in cells lacking Rvs167 . Since the Rvs complex is a dimer 146 of Rvs161 and Rvs167 ( Boeke et al . , 2014 ) , deletion of RVS167 gene effectively removes both proteins 147 from endocytic sites ( Lombardi and Riezman , 2001 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ) . We quantified the effect 148 of rvs167 Δ on membrane invagination ( Fig . 1A , B , E ) . When Sla1 was observed in rvs167 Δ cells , nearly 149 30 % of endocytic events displayed the beginning of movement away from the starting position - thus 150 invagination formation - then retract back to starting position ( Fig . 1A , B ) . Retractions indicate failure 151 of vesicle formation . Thus only 70 % of Sla1 patches underwent apparently successful scission in 152 rvs167 Δ cells ( Fig . 1B ) . Similar scission rates have been measured in earlier studies ( Kaksonen et al . , 153 2005 ; Smaczynska - de Rooij et al . , 2010 ; Kishimoto et al . , 2011 ) . We classified endocytic events into 154 successful and retracting events and analyzed the average centroid movement in these two classes . 155 Sla1 centroid movement in both successful and retracting endocytic events in rvs167 Δ cells look similar 156 to WT up to invagination length of about 50 nm ( Fig . 1E , S1E ) . In WT cells , Abp1 intensity begins to 157 drop at scission time ( Fig . S1B ) ( Picco et al . , 2015 ) . Abp1 intensity in rvs167 Δ cells dropped after Sla1 158 centroid moved about 50 nm , suggesting that scission occurs in successful events at invagination lengths 159 around 50 nm ( Fig . S1D ) . That membrane scission occurs at shorter invagination lengths than in WT is 160 corroborated by the smaller vesicles found using CLEM in rvs167 Δ cells ( Kukulski et al . , 2012 ) . CLEM has 161 moreover shown that Rvs167 localizes to endocytic sites after the invaginations are about 50 nm long 162 ( Kukulski et al . , 2012 ) . Normal initial Sla1 movement in rvs167 Δ indicates therefore that membrane 163 invagination is unaffected till Rvs would normally arrive . 164 Synaptojanins influence vesicle uncoating , but not scission dynamics . 165 As Vps1 did not appear to influence membrane scission , we proceeded to test the potential role of 166 synatojanins in scission ( Liu et al . , 2009 ) . Apart from their role in vesicle uncoating , synaptojanins have 167 been proposed to mediate scission with their PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 hydrolysis activity ( Sun et al . , 2007 ; Toret et al . , 168 2008 ) . In this model , BAR domains coat the invaginated tube , and preferential hydrolysis of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at 169 the invagination tip unprotected by BAR proteins generates line tension , eventually causing membrane 170 scission . We reasoned that if the yeast synaptojanins are involved in scission , their deletion should 171 alter the invagination dynamics visualized with Sla1 - eGFP or Rvs167 - eGFP . Three synaptojanin - like 172 proteins have been identified in S . cerevisiae : Inp51 , Inp52 , and Inp53 . Inp51 - eGFP exhibits a diffuse 173 cytoplasmic signal , Inp52 - eGFP localizes to endocytic sites , and Inp53 localizes to patches within the 174 cytoplasm ( Fig . 2A ) ( Bensen et al . , 2000 ; Sun et al . , 2007 ) . Since Inp52 can be observed at endocytic 175 sites , we began with determining the spatial and temporal recruitment of Inp52 within the endocytic 176 machinery . We tracked and aligned the averaged centroid of Inp52 spatially and temporally in relation to 177 other endocytic proteins . In order to do this , we imaged Inp52 - eGFP simultaneously with Abp1 - mCherry . 178 We also imaged Sla1 - eGFP and Rvs167 - eGFP together with Abp1 - mCherry . Using Abp1 as the common 179 reference frame , we were able to compare the arrival of the different proteins with respect to that 180 of Abp1 . We assigned as time = 0 s , the peak fluorescent intensity of Abp1 . In WT cells , this peak is 181 concomitant with membrane scission , and also coincides with the peak Rvs167 fluorescent intensity 182 ( S1B ) ( Picco et al . , 2015 ) . On the y - axis , 0 nm indicates the non - motile position of the Sla1 centroid . 183 Positions of the other centroids are spatially and temporally aligned to each other ( Fig . 2B ) . This analysis 184 showed that Inp52 molecules arrived after Rvs167 , and localized to the invagination tip . The localization 185 and assembly dynamics of Inp52 are consistent with a role in the late stage of membrane invagination . 186 Inp53 was not investigated further because it could not be detected at endocytic sites ( Fig . 2A ) , and is 187 5 of 24 r v s 167 Δ i n p 52 Δ i n p 51 Δ W T i n w a r d m o v e m e n t ( n m ) i n w a r d m o v e m e n t ( n m ) i n w a r d m o v e m e n t ( n m ) t i m e ( s ) t i m e ( s ) WT inp52Δ C .

Shading on plots represent 95 % confidence interval . likely localized to the trans - Golgi network ( Bensen et al . , 2000 ) . Although we were unable to observe 188 localization of Inp51 at the plasma membrane ( Fig . 2A ) , deletion of Inp51 has been shown to exacerbate 189 the effect of inp52 Δ on endocytosis ( Singer - Krüger et al . , 1998 ) , so both Inp51 and Inp52 were tested 190 as potential scission regulators . 191 inp51 Δ inp52 Δ cells have dramatic morphological and growth defects , defects in vacuole morphology 192 and budding polarity ( Singer - Krüger et al . , 1998 ; Stolz et al . , 1998a ) . These cells also have drastically 193 altered PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels ( Stolz et al . , 1998b ) , which likely affect the assembly , disassembly , and function 194 of many PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding endocytic proteins . The double mutation reportedly causes aberrations in 195 endocytic coat , myosin , and actin network behaviour ( Sun et al . , 2007 ) . Coat proteins Sla1 , Sla2 and Ent1 196 have elongated lifetimes at endocytic sites , as do type I myosin Myo5 , and Rvs167 . Time taken for Abp1 197 assembly and disassembly is more than doubled ( Sun et al . , 2007 ) . That multiple endocytic phases , 198 including scission , are affected in the double mutation makes it difficult to demonstrate a direct role in 199 scission . Patches of Rvs167 - eGFP tracked in these cells persist instead of disassembling immediately 200 after inward movement , leading to aggregation of fluorescent patches inside the cytoplasm ( Fig . S2B ) . 201 6 of 24 We cannot , by the methods used here , distinguish between scission and other defects . We reasoned 202 that a quantitative analysis of single mutants was therefore better suited to reveal a scission - specific 203 function for synaptojanins , without perturbing overall PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 homeostasis . 204 Dynamics of Sla1 - eGFP and Rvs167 - eGFP in inp51 Δ and inp52 Δ cells were compared against the WT 205 ( Fig . 2C - E ) . Scission efficiency did not significantly decrease in inp51 Δ compared to the WT , but showed 206 a slight decrease in inp52 Δ cells ( Fig . 2C ) . The movement of Sla1 and Rvs167 centroids in successful 207 endocytic events in inp51 Δ were virtually the same as in WT ( Fig . 2 D , E ) , while Rvs167 assembly and 208 disassembly took longer ( Fig . S2A ) . Rvs167 signal in inp51 Δ cells persisted longer compared to the WT 209 ( Fig . 2E ) , likely because of a delay in Rvs167 disassembly from the newly formed vesicle . In inp52 Δ 210 cells , Sla1 centroid movement had the same magnitude and rate as in WT , but Sla1 - eGFP signal was 211 persistent after inward movement ( Fig . 2D ) . Sla1 assembly and disassembly were aberrant in inp52 Δ 212 cells compared to WT ( Fig . S2A ) . These data are consistent with synaptojanin involvement in assembly 213 and disassembly of coat and scission proteins at endocytic sites ( Toret et al . , 2008 ) . However , because 214 the centroid movements of Sla1 and Rvs167 are unaltered , synaptojanins may not have a direct or 215 major role in membrane scission . 216 Rvs BAR domains recognize membrane curvature in vivo 217 So far Rvs167 and Rvs161 remain the proteins that have the most significant influence on scission 218 efficiency . Recruitment to and interaction of the Rvs complex at endocytic sites was thus investigated 219 further . The Rvs complex can tubulate liposomes in vitro , likely via the BAR domain ( Youn et al . , 2010 ) . 220 Interaction of the BAR domain with membrane curvature in vivo has however not been tested . The 221 Rvs167 - SH3 domain can interact with proteins associated with actin patches such as Abp1 , Las17 , Myo3 , 222 Myo5 and Vrp1 , but the role of these interactions in vivo is not known ( Lila and Drubin , 1997 ; Colwill 223 et al . , 1999 ; Madania et al . , 1999 ; Liu et al . , 2009 ) . We first tested the BAR - membrane interaction by 224 deleting the SH3 domain to remove its contribution ( Fig . 3A ) . We then observed localization of Rvs167 - 225 sh3 Δ in sla2 Δ cells , which do not have membrane curvature at endocytic sites ( Picco et al . , 2018 ) . Sla2 226 acts as the molecular linker between forces exerted by the actin network and the plasma membrane 227 ( Skruzny et al . , 2012 ) . sla2 Δ cells therefore contain a polymerizing actin network at endocytic patches , 228 but the membrane has no curvature , and endocytosis fails ( Skruzny et al . , 2012 ; Picco et al . , 2018 ) . 229 Colocalization of endogenously tagged full - length Rvs167 - eGFP and Rvs167 - sh3 Δ - eGFP with Abp1 - 230 mCherry in WT and sla2 Δ cells were compared ( Fig . 3B ) . We thus tested whether Rvs BAR domain could 231 be recruited to the endocytic sites in sla2 Δ cells , independent of membrane curvature . In sla2 Δ cells , 232 the full - length Rvs167 co - localized with Abp1 - mCherry indicating that it was recruited to endocytic sites 233 without membrane curvature ( Fig . 3B , “ sla2 Δ ” ) . Rvs167 - sh3 Δ did not appear at the plasma membrane 234 except for rare transient patches . Therefore , Rvs167 - sh3 Δ , that is , the BAR domain alone , is not recruited 235 to endocytic sites in the absence of curvature in sla2 Δ cells . Localization of the full - length protein in 236 sla2 Δ cells is therefore likely via SH3 domain interaction . 237 Rvs SH3 domains have an actin and curvature - independent localisation 238 We wanted to distinguish between Rvs association with membrane curvature and actin . Latrunculin 239 A ( LatA ) inhibits actin polymerization , and therefore the assembly of actin and actin - related proteins 240 at endocytic sites . sla2 Δ as well as LatA remove membrane curvature , but sla2 Δ retains actin patches 241 at endocytic sites ( Kukulski et al . , 2012 ; Picco et al . , 2018 ) . To study the interaction of Rvs at endocytic 242 sites without actin proteins , we observed the localization of Rvs167 and Rvs167 - sh3 Δ in LatA treated WT 243 cells ( Fig . 3B , “LatA” ) . We also observed full - length and mutant protein in sla2 Δ cells treated with LatA , so 244 7 of 24 Rvs167 - GPA Rvs167 - SH3 Rvs161 BAR Rvs167 - BAR s l a 2 Δ B .

Full - length Rvs167 localized transiently at the plasma membrane in WT 246 cells treated with LatA as well as in sla2 Δ cells treated with LatA ( Fig . 3B ) . Rvs167 - sh3 Δ did not localize to 247 the plasma membrane in either case . Thus , localization of full - length Rvs167 in the presence of LatA in 248 WT and sla2 Δ cells is due to the SH3 domain . This also indicates that the SH3 domain is able to recruit 249 Rvs molecules to the plasma membrane in an actin - and curvature - independent manner . 250 Rvs167 SH3 domains are likely recruited by Myo3 251 Type I myosins Myo3 and Myo5 , and yeast verprolin Vrp1 have known genetic or physical interactions 252 with the Rvs167 SH3 domain ( Lila and Drubin , 1997 ; Colwill et al . , 1999 ; Madania et al . , 1999 ; Liu et al . , 253 2009 ) . We tested the possible role of these proteins in the SH3 - dependent localization of Rvs167 in cells 254 with the gene for one of these proteins deleted , and treated with LatA ( Fig . 4 ) . By using LatA we expected 255 to reproduce the situation in which the interaction between the BAR domain and curved membrane 256 is removed . Then , if we lost SH3 interaction because we removed the protein with which it interacts , 257 we would lose localization of Rvs167 completely . Neither Vrp1 nor Myo5 deletion in combination with 258 LatA treatment removed the localization of Rvs167 : 88 % and 87 % cells respectively still showed Rvs167 259 localization , similar to WT localization . Deletion of Myo3 with LatA treatment reduced localization of 260 Rvs167 ( 43 . 4 % of cells with localization ) , indicating that SH3 domains interact at endocytic sites primarily 261 with Myo3 . 262 8 of 24 vrp1 Δ myo3 Δ myo5 Δ WT L a t A Rvs167 - eGFP 2µm 87 % 88 % 87 % 43 % u n t r ea t e d Figure 4 .

Percentages indicate number of LatA treated cells in which Rvs167 - eGFP is localized at the plasma membrane . Deletion of Rvs167 SH3 domain affects coat and actin dynamics 263 Since the Rvs167 - SH3 domain had an influence on the recruitment of the Rvs complex to endocytic sites , 264 we wondered if the domain affects not just recruitment of the protein , but also invagination progression . 265 We compared dynamics of coat , actin , and scission markers in WT and rvs167 - sh3 Δ cells ( Fig . 5 ) . 266 The Sla1 centroid position in rvs167 - sh3 Δ cells at scission time is about 70 nm compared to 150 nm in 267 WT , and this movement takes 8 s compared to 5 s in WT ( Fig . 5A , B ) . The total movement of Rvs167 - sh3 Δ 268 centroid is half that of full - length Rvs167 ( Fig . 5A , B ) . Reduced movements of both Sla1 and Rvs167 - sh3 Δ 269 centroids in rvs167 - sh3 Δ cells are consistent with the formation of shorter endocytic invaginations in 270 these cells . 271 We observed that Rvs167 - sh3 Δ recruitment begins at nearly the peak of Abp1 recruitment in rvs167 - sh3 Δ 272 cells , while in WT , full - length Rvs167 is recruited halfway into Abp1 recruitment ( Fig . 5 C , D ) . Rvs167 - sh3 Δ 273 accumulation however , began when Abp1 molecule number in the mutant was the same as in WT 274 ( 300 copies , Fig . 5C , D ) . Both Rvs167 and Rvs167 - sh3 Δ molecules arrived at endocytic sites when the 275 Sla1 centroid was 30 - 50 nm away from its starting position , so the endocytic coat has moved a certain 276 amount when both WT and mutant forms of Rvs start to be recruited . That Rvs167 - sh3 Δ recruitment 277 begins at a certain length of the invagination suggests that the Rvs complex is recruited to a specific 278 geometry of membrane invagination . Rvs167 - sh3 Δ accumulation may be delayed because invaginations 279 in these cells take longer to acquire this geometry . 280 We think that Rvs molecules in WT cells likely arrive below our detection threshold , and that the arrival 281 of the molecules supports invagination growth . As the invagination grows , Rvs continues to accumulate 282 on the invagination tubes , and molecule numbers are eventually large enough to be detected . In 283 support of this , CLEM has shown that when Rvs167 molecules are detected at endocytic sites , the 284 invaginations are about 50 nm long , shortly after the membrane is already tubular ( Kukulski et al . , 285 2012 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ) . Since Rvs167 - sh3 Δ molecules accumulate slower than full - length protein , their 286 support to membrane growth is less effective , and the invagination grows slower . Abp1 accumulation 287 correlates with invagination growth , so slower invagination growth accumulates Abp1 slower . Recruit - 288 ment of Rvs167 - sh3 Δ was significantly reduced compared to Rvs167 ( Fig . 5C , D ) , although cytoplasmic 289 concentration of both were similar ( Fig . S4 ) . Recruitment therefore is unlikely to be limited by expression 290 of the mutant protein .

Shading represents 95 % confidence interval . 5 s in WT , and total number of Abp1 molecules recruited was reduced from nearly 600 to 400 , 60 % of 292 WT recruitment ( Fig . 5C , D ) . Recruitment and disassembly defects of Abp1 indicate disruption of actin 293 network dynamics in rvs167 - sh3 Δ cells . 294 In WT cells , the number of Rvs167 and Abp1 molecules peak at the same time . Thus , the actin network 295 begins disassembling as soon as scission occurs ( Fig . 5C ) . However , in rvs167 - sh3 Δ cells , the numbers 296 of Rvs167 and Abp1 molecules peaked asynchronously , with Rvs167 peaking later . This observation 297 suggests that there is a feedback mechanism between the actin network and membrane scission , and 298 that this feedback is also disrupted in rvs167 - sh3 Δ cells . 299 Increased BAR domain recruitment corresponds to increased membrane movement 300 Reduced Sla1 movement was observed in both rvs167 Δ ( Fig . 1 ) and rvs167 - sh3 Δ ( Fig . 5 ) cells , in which 301 about half the WT number of Rvs167 molecules are recruited ( Fig . 5 ) . This suggests that increased Sla1 302 movement correlates with increased recruitment of Rvs167 . We wondered if Sla1 movement would 303 scale with amount of Rvs recruited to endocytic sites . This could suggest that recruitment of Rvs BAR 304 domains scaffolds the membrane invagination and protects it against membrane scission ( Boucrot et al . , 305 2012 ; Dmitrieff and Nédélec , 2015 ) . We titrated the amount of Rvs expressed in cells by duplicating the 306 open reading frame of RVS167 and RVS161 genes ( Huber et al . , 2014 ) . We also generated a strain in 307 which the rvs167 - sh3 Δ gene was duplicated . We thus obtained cells containing either 2x copies of both 308 RVS genes ( 2xRVS ) , 1x copy of the RVS genes ( 1xRVS , ie WT ) , 2x copies of rvs167 - sh3 Δ ( 2xBAR ) , or 1x copy 309 10 of 24 of rvs167 - sh3 Δ ( 1xBAR ) ( Fig . 6A - D ) . In the 2xBAR strain , RVS161 was not duplicated . This is because we 310 measured the number of molecules of mutant Rvs167 recruited in the 2xBAR strain with and without 311 RVS161 duplicated , and found that they were the same , suggesting that Rvs161 protein expression is 312 not limiting for assembly of the Rvs complex in this strain ( data not shown ) . So we used the genetically 313 simpler strain , without the RVS161 duplication . 314 0 50 100 150 200 0 10 −10 0 10 0 200 400 600 0 50 100 150 −10 0 10 0 50 100 150 5 - 5 0 10 5 - 5 i n w a r d m o v e m e n t ( n m ) m o l e c u l e n u m b e r m o l e c u l e n u m b e r i n w a r d m o v e m e n t ( n m ) R v s 167 R v s 167 S l a 1 A bp 1 A .

D : Abp1 molecule number , aligned that time = 0 s corresponds to Abp1 intensity maximum Maximum number of WT and mutant Rvs167 molecules recruited at endocytic sites varied in 1xRVS ( WT ) , 315 2xRVS , 1xBAR , 2xBAR strains between 50 and 180 copies ( Fig . 6A , S6 ) . Excess Rvs recruited in 2xRVS cells 316 ( compared to 1xRVS ) did not change the total movement of Rvs167 , but Rvs disassembly took longer 317 ( Fig . 6A ) . In the 2xBAR case , amount of Rvs167 - sh3 Δ molecules recruited to endocytic sites increased 318 compared to 1xBAR , as did the movement of the centroid ( Fig . 6A , B ) . BAR domain recruitment increased 319 from 1xBAR , to 2xBAR , 1xRVS , and was finally maximal in 2xRVS cells . The trend of inward movement of 320 the Rvs167 centroid suggests that movement correlates with number of BAR molecules recruited to 321 sites , but saturates in the case of 2xRVS . The delayed disassembly of 2xRVS compared to 1xRVS may be 322 due to a change in interaction between the BAR domains and underlying membrane . The membrane 323 may be already saturated with bound RVS , causing perhaps interaction between Rvs dimers rather than 324 Rvs and membrane . Alternatively , excess Rvs molecules may be recruited to the vesicle , so there is a 325 delay in disassembly of these molecules compared to those on the invagination tube . 326 Abp1 molecule numbers and lifetimes at endocytic sites were different between the 1xRVS 2xRVS , 327 1xBAR , 2xBAR strains ( Fig . 6D , S5 ) . Total Abp1 molecules recruited were reduced in 1xBAR compared to 328 11 of 24 the 2xBAR , 1xRVS and 2xRVS ( Fig . 6D , Fig . S6 ) . As Abp1 molecule numbers increased , shorter lifetimes , 329 approaching that of WT Abp1 were observed ( Fig . S5 ) . Comparing between the 1xRVS ( WT ) , 2xRVS , 1xBAR , 330 2xBAR strains , the cells with higher Abp1 molecule numbers showed larger total movement of the 331 Sla1 centroid ( Fig . 6C , D ) . This indicates a correlation between the maximum number of Abp1 molecules 332 recruited and total invagination length . In rvs167 Δ cells , measured Abp1 molecule numbers were about 333 the same as in WT ( Fig . 6D ) . Quantification of Abp1 molecule numbers in these cells is confounded 334 by the existence of two types of endocytic events : successful and retracting events . We were unable 335 to separate these events in the molecule number quantification , but we speculate that retracting 336 events may continue to assemble an actin network after or during retraction . This accumulation could 337 compensate for smaller Abp1 numbers that may have been measured at successful endocytic events . A 338 much smaller percentage of endocytic events in 1BAR and 2xBAR retract , so we do not expect retracting 339 endocytic invaginations in these cells to confound the Abp1 quantification significantly ( Fig . S6 ) . 340 We found that increasing the expression of RVS caused increased recruitment of Rvs molecules to 341 endocytic sites . We also found that the number of Rvs BAR domains recruited to membrane invaginations 342 correlates positively with total length of the invagination . Furthermore , this length of the invagination 343 also correlates positively with the number of Abp1 molecules recruited . 344 Discussion 345 Recruitment and function of the Rvs complex has been studied in this work , and the applicability of 346 several membrane scission models to yeast endocytosis have been tested . We propose that Rvs is 347 recruited to endocytic sites via interactions between the BAR domains and invaginated membrane , 348 and also via SH3 mediated protein - protein interactions . SH3 interactions are required for efficient 349 recruitment of Rvs . We found that assembly of Rvs at the membrane invagination delays membrane 350 scission , allowing the invagination to grow to its full length . WT invagination growth depends on 351 recruitment of a critical number of Rvs molecules . Both timing and recruitment efficiency of Rvs appear 352 crucial to Rvs function . 353 BAR domains sense in vivo membrane curvature and time the recruitment of Rvs 354 The curved structure of Endophilin and Amphiphysin BAR domains allows them to interact with curved 355 membranes . These proteins are able to form organized assemblies on tubular membranes in vitro ( Mim 356 et al . , 2012 ) . Rvs167 - sh3 Δ localized to endocytic sites when curvature was present ( Fig . 3B , ”Untreated” ) . 357 Without the SH3 domain , and in the absence of membrane curvature in sla2 Δ cells , Rvs167 - sh3 Δ did 358 not localize to endocytic sites ( Fig . 3B , ” sla2 Δ ” ) . This indicates that the Rvs167 - sh3 Δ localization was 359 via BAR - membrane curvature interaction . This demonstrates that the Rvs BAR domain senses and 360 requires membrane curvature to interact with endocytic sites . Rvs167 - sh3 Δ had a similar average 361 lifetime at endocytic sites as full - length Rvs167 ( Fig . 5A , B ) . However , time alignment with Abp1 showed 362 that there was a delay in the recruitment of Rvs167 - sh3 Δ ( Fig . 5C , D ) . Sla1 centroid movement was 363 slower in rvs167 - sh3 Δ cells than in WT cells : it takes longer for the membrane in these cells to reach 364 the same invagination length as WT . We propose that the start of Rvs recruitment is timed to a specific 365 membrane invagination length - therefore to a specific membrane curvature - accounting for the delay 366 in recruitment of Rvs167 - sh3 Δ . The precise timing of recruitment is therefore provided by the BAR 367 domain interacting with membrane at a specific curvature . 368 12 of 24 SH3 domains allow efficient , actin - and membrane curvature - independent 369 recruitment of Rvs 370 Rvs167 - sh3 Δ accumulated to about half the number of full length Rvs167 ( Fig . 5C , D ) even though similar 371 cytoplasmic concentration was measured for both proteins ( Fig . S4 ) , indicating that loss of the SH3 372 domain decreases the efficiency of recruitment of Rvs to endocytic sites . In sla2 Δ cells , full - length Rvs167 373 forms patches on the membrane ( Fig . 3B , ” sla2 Δ ” ) . Since Rvs167 - sh3 Δ does not localize to the plasma 374 membrane in sla2 Δ cells , localization of the full - length protein must be mediated by the SH3 domain . 375 The full - length Rvs167 is able to assemble and disassemble at cortical patches in sla2 Δ cells , that is , 376 without the curvature - dependent interaction of the BAR domain ( Fig . S3 ) . This indicates recruitment 377 and disassembly of Rvs can occur via interactions between its SH3 domains and endocytic sites . In 378 sla2 Δ cells treated with LatA ( Fig . 3B , ” sla2 Δ + LatA” ) , both membrane curvature and actin are removed 379 from endocytic sites . Full - length Rvs167 in these cells still shows transient localizations at the plasma 380 membrane . Therefore the SH3 domain is able to localise the Rvs complex in an actin - and curvature - 381 independent manner . 382 Recruitment of Rvs167 affects endocytic actin network dynamics 383 In WT cells , the Abp1 and Rvs167 fluorescent intensities peaked concomitantly ( Fig . 5C , D ) , and the 384 consequent decay of both coincided . Membrane scission occurs around the intensity peak of Rvs167 385 ( Kukulski et al . , 2012 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ) . Coincident disassembly therefore indicates that upon vesicle 386 scission , the actin network is rapidly disassembled . This coincident peak was lost in rvs167 - sh3 Δ cells : 387 Rvs167 - sh3 Δ fluorescent intensity peaks after Abp1 intensity starts to drop . The decay of Abp1 is also 388 prolonged , taking over double the time as in WT . Although it is not clear what the decoupling of Abp1 389 and Rvs167 - sh3 Δ peaks means , the changes in Abp1 dynamics suggests a strong disruption of the 390 actin network . In 1xBAR cells , the average lifetime of actin marker Abp1 was about 25 s ( Fig . S5 ) . This 391 lifetime decreases in 2xBAR cells to about 20 s , a shift towards the WT Abp1 lifetime of around 10 s . 392 Therefore we conclude that recruitment of the Rvs BAR domains to the invagination regulates actin 393 network dynamics . 394 Rvs acts as a membrane scaffold , delaying membrane scission 395 Invagination length in non - retracting endocytic events in rvs167 Δ cells at scission time was about 50 nm 396 ( Fig . 1E ) , only a third the WT length . Together with electron microscopy data ( Kukulski et al . , 2012 ) , this 397 shows that scission can occur at much shorter invagination lengths . In WT cells , scission does not occur 398 at these lengths , instead invaginations grow to 150 nm ( Kukulski et al . , 2012 ) . Since invagination lengths 399 were increased , compared to rvs167 Δ and 1xBAR , by overexpression of the Rvs167 - sh3 Δ protein , that 400 is , in 2xBAR ( Fig . 6A , C ) , we think that localization of Rvs - BAR domains to the membrane tube stabilizes 401 the membrane and allows invaginations to progress ( Boucrot et al . , 2012 ; Dmitrieff and Nédélec , 2015 ) . 402 Yeast endocytosis is heavily dependent on a dynamic actin network to generate the forces that bend 403 the membrane ( Kübler et al . , 1993 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2003 ; Picco et al . , 2018 ) . We propose that Rvs 404 accumulation stabilizes the membrane invagination and thereby also increases the amount of actin 405 required to sever the membrane . This allows the invagination to grow until WT invagination length 406 is reached . We speculate that continued invagination growth allows the actin network to generate 407 enough force to compensate for the stabilization . There is a limit to the stabilization by BAR domains : 408 in 2xRVS cells , invagination lengths are the same as in 1xRVS cells even though more Rvs is recruited . It 409 is possible that the nature of interaction of the Rvs complex with the membrane changes after a certain 410 amount of Rvs is recruited . Once the membrane is saturated with Rvs molecules , BAR domains may 411 13 of 24 interact with each other rather than with the underlying membrane . This could explain the changes in 412 the disassembly dynamics of Rvs in the 2xRVS case ( Fig . 6A ) . 413 If enough forces are generated at around 50 nm , why is scission inefficient and membrane retraction 414 rates increased in rvs167 Δ compared to WT ? Forces generated by the actin network may be at a threshold 415 level when the invaginations are short . There could be enough force to sever the membrane , but not 416 enough to sever reliably . The Rvs scaffold may then stabilize the membrane invagination , preventing 417 retraction , and allowing continued growth . This subsequently allows the actin network to continue 418 growing , accumulating actin . Eventually enough actin is accumulated to reliably cause scission . We 419 hypothesise that increased actin amount yields higher force on the membrane . This force stretches the 420 membrane , eventually breaking it . Controlling membrane tube length could also be a way for the cell to 421 control the size of the vesicles formed , and therefore the amount of cargo that can be packed into the 422 vesicle . 423 What causes membrane scission ? 424 We have tested candidate proteins implicated in yeast endocytic scission and looked for scission defects . 425 Increased Sla1 retraction rates would indicate higher rate of scission failure . Larger total movement of 426 Sla1 and Rvs167 centroids would indicate that a longer invagination has been formed , and that scission 427 has not occured at normal invagination lengths . We did not see a change in Sla1 or Rvs167 centroid 428 movements that would indicate scission defects in any mutants that we studied , other than in Rvs 429 mutants . In vps1 Δ cells , there is no major change in retraction rate , nor are there changes in Sla1 or 430 Rvs167 dynamics . We conclude that Vps1 is not necessary for Rvs localization or function , and is not 431 necessary for scission . 432 Sla1 and Rvs167 centroid dynamics showed that deletion of neither Inp51 nor Inp52 resulted in scission 433 delay . In inp51 Δ cells , Rvs167 assembly and disassembly was slightly slower than in WT : Inp51 could 434 play a role in recruitment to and release of Rvs from endocytic sites . In the inp52 Δ cells , about 12 % 435 of Sla1 - GFP tracks retracted . Inp52 has a moderate influence on scission efficiency , but this is not 436 reflected in our observation of invagination dynamics . In inp52 Δ cells , Sla1 assembly is slower than 437 in WT , and Sla1 and Rvs167 centroids persisted after scission . Inp52 likely plays a role in assembly of 438 coat proteins , and in recycling endocytic proteins from the vesicle to the cytosolic pool . Synaptojanins 439 could help recruit Rvs at endocytic sites via their proline - rich domains by binding Rvs167 SH3 domains . 440 They are involved in vesicle uncoating post - scission , likely by dephosphorylating PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and inducing 441 disassembly of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding endocytic proteins . The synaptojanins do not appear to play a major 442 role in scission , but Inp51 and Inp52 may function synergistically to influence membrane tension . The 443 compounded problems related to lipid hydrolysis , and lack of tools that have the time resolution to 444 measure membrane tension in vivo prevent us from conclusively ruling out line tension as a contributor 445 to yeast endocytic scission . 446 Our RVS duplication data is able to test whether the protein friction model is applicable to yeast endocytic 447 scission ( Simunovic et al . , 2017 ) . According to this model , a frictional force between a moving membrane 448 tube and a coat of BAR protein bound to it causes the tube to undergo scission . Therefore , a higher 449 frictional force should break the tube sooner than a lower force . We increased the frictional force on 450 the membrane by increasing the number of BAR domains bound to the membrane tube , in 2xRVS 451 cells . In 2xRVS cells , adding up to 1 . 6x the WT amount of Rvs at faster rates to membrane tubes did not 452 affect the length at which the membrane undergoes scission ( Fig . 6 ) . In rvs167 Δ cells , frictional forces 453 generated should be reduced compared to WT cells . Rather than increased Sla1 movement as this 454 model would predict , we observed decreased Sla1 movement ( Fig . 1 ) . We therefore think that protein 455 14 of 24 friction does not contribute significantly to membrane scission in yeast endocytosis . 456 A similar amount of Abp1 is recruited in both 1xRVS and 2xRVS cases , corresponding to coat movement 457 of about 150 nm . Magnitude of coat movement correlates with the total amount of Abp1 , and therefore , 458 with the amount of actin recruited . A dynamic actin network is required for endocytosis in yeast 459 ( Kübler et al . , 1993 ; Picco et al . , 2018 ) , and such a network is able to generate force ( Theriot et al . , 460 1992 ) . Coupling between the actin network and membrane is necessary for invagination formation 461 ( Skruzny et al . , 2012 ; Picco et al . , 2018 ) . The current understanding of yeast endocytosis suggests 462 that the membrane is pushed into the cytoplasm by an actin network polymerizing at the base of the 463 invagination , and is mechanically coupled to the invagination tip . More actin recruitment can generate 464 higher force ( Bieling et al . , 2016 ) . Actin may also provide a scaffold that aids membrane invagination . 465 More actin is therefore consistent with scaffolding as well as with increased force generation . We 466 propose that increased Abp1 recruitment - and therefore increased actin - leads to an increasing 467 pushing force on the membrane , and that this force is responsible for invagination growth as well as 468 for membrane scission . Stretching the membrane can eventually cause it to break , causing vesicle 469 formation . The amount of force necessary to break the membrane is determined by properties of the 470 membrane like rigidity and tension , properties of the proteins accumulated on the membrane , and 471 by the high intracellular turgor pressure in yeast cells ( Dmitrieff and Nédélec , 2015 ) . Once this force is 472 overcome , vesicle scission occurs , and membrane - bound Rvs is released . On the other hand , release of 473 Rvs could cause instabilities in membrane shape that could also lead to scission ( Dmitrieff and Nédélec , 474 2015 ) . It is unclear whether scission causes release of Rvs , or vice - versa . The observation that Rvs167 475 can accumulate and disassemble on the membrane in the absence of membrane curvature ( in sla2 Δ 476 cells ) suggests that binding - unbinding can be mediated by another interaction partner . This in turn can 477 allow speculation that Rvs release can be triggered by this partner . A method for detecting scission 478 with high temporal resolution is needed to resolve whether Rvs release or scission occurs first . Release 479 of the SH3 domains could eventually indicate to the actin network that vesicle scission has occurred , 480 influencing disassembly of actin components . 481 Sla1 Abp1 Inp52 Rvs BAR scaffolding Actin - mediated scission Actin - mediated membrane invagination Figure 7 . Model for yeast endocytic scission . Membrane at an endocytic site is bent by forces derived from actin polymerization . BAR domains arrive at a tubular invagination and scaffold the membrane , delaying scission . Actin forces eventually overcome the influence of BAR scaffolding , and the membrane breaks , resulting in vesicle formation . We propose that Rvs is recruited to endocytic sites by two distinct mechanisms . The SH3 domain of 482 Rvs167 recruits Rvs to endocytic sites , effectively increasing the likelihood of BAR domain interaction with 483 tubular membrane . BAR domains bind endocytic sites by sensing tubular membrane . The membrane 484 invagination is stabilized against scission by BAR - membrane interaction . This stabilization prevents 485 15 of 24 actin - generated forces from rupturing the membrane , and the invaginations continue to grow in length 486 as actin continues to polymerize . As actin continues to accumulate , pushing forces overcome the 487 resistance to membrane scission . The membrane ruptures , and a vesicle is formed . 488 Methods and Materials 489 Homologous recombination with PCR casette insertion 490 Tagging or deletion of endogenous genes was done by homologous integration of the product of 491 a Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) using appropriate primers and a plasmid containing a selection 492 cassette and fluorescent tag , or only selection cassette for gene deletions ( Janke et al . , 2004 ) . PCRs used 493 the Velocity Polymerase for fluorescent tagging , and Q5 for gene deletions using the NAT casette . All 494 fluorescently tagged genes have a C - terminus tag and are expressed endogenously . Gene deletions and 495 fluorescent tags are checked by PCR . vps1 Δ and gene duplications were confirmed by DNA sequencing . 496 Live - cell imaging 497 Sample preparation for live imaging 498 Yeast cells were grown overnight at 25 ∘ C in imaging medium Synthetic Complete without L - Tryptophan 499 ( SC - Trp ) . 40 µL 4mg / ml Concavalin A ( ConA ) was incubated on a coverslip for 10 minutes . 40 µL yeast 500 cells at OD 600 = 0 . 3 - 0 . 8 was added to the coverslip after removing the ConA , and incubated for another 501 10 minutes . Cells were then removed , adhered cells were washed 3x in SC - Trp , and 40 µL SC - TRP was 502 finally added to the coverslip to prevent cells from drying . 503 Sample preparation for live imaging in LatA treated cells 504 Cells went through the same procedure as above till the last washing step . Instead of SC - Trp , 100x 505 diluted LatA in SC - Trp was added to the adhered cells . Cells were incubated in LatA for 10 minutes 506 before imaging . 507 Epifluorescent imaging for centroid tracking 508 Live - cell imaging was performed as in our previous work ( Picco et al . , 2015 ) . All images were obtained at 509 room temperature using an Olympus IX81 microscope equipped with a 100× / NA 1 . 45 PlanApo objective 510 , with an additional 1 . 6x magnification lens and an EMCCD camera . The GFP channel was imaged 511 using a 470 / 22 nm band - pass excitation filter and a 520 / 35 nm band - pass emission filter . mCherry 512 epifluorescence imaging was carried out using a 556 / 20 nm band - pass excitation filter and a 624 / 40 513 band - pass emission filter . GFP was excited using a 488 nm solid state laser and mCherry was excited 514 using a 561 nm solid state laser . Hardware was controlled using Metamorph software . For single - 515 channel images , 80 - 120 ms was used as exposure time . All dual - channel images were acquired using 516 250 ms exposure time . Dual - color images were obtained using simultaneous illumination using 488 517 and 561 nm lasers . A dichroic mirror and emission filters 650 / 75 and 525 / 50 were used for image 518 acquisition , and corrected using TetraSpeck beads for chromatic abberation . 519 16 of 24 Epifluorescent imaging for molecule number quantification 520 Images were acquired as in previous work ( Picco et al . , 2015 ) . Z - stacks of cells containing the GFP - or 521 mCherry - tagged protein of interest , incubated along with cells containing Nuf2 - GFP , were acquired 522 using 400 ms exposure using a mercury vapour lamp , on a CCD camera . Z stacks were spaced at 200 523 nm . 524 Live - cell image analysis 525 Images were processed for background noise using a rolling ball radius of 90 pixels . Particle detection , 526 and tracking was performed for a particle size of 6 pixels , using scripts that combine background 527 subtraction with Particle Tracker and Detector , that can be found on ImageJ ( http : / / imagej . nih . gov ) . 528 Further analysis for centroid averaging , alignments between dual - color images and single channel 529 images , for alignment to the reference Abp1 were done using scripts written in Matlab ( Mathworks ) and 530 R ( www . r - project . org ) , written originally by Andrea Picco , and modified by me . Details of analysis can be 531 found in previous work ( Picco et al . , 2015 ) . All movement and intensity plots from centroid tracking 532 show the average centroid with 95 % confidence interval . 533 Quantification of cytoplasmic concentration 534 On a maximum intensity projection of time - lapse images , the average pixel intensity within a circle of 535 set radius in the cytoplasm was measured . This circle is manually arranged so that cortical patches 536 were excluded , and mean intensity was acquired for about 10 cells of each cell type . A fixed area 537 outside the cells was drawn , and mean intensity was calculated to establish ”background intensity” . 538 This background intensity was then subtracted from the mean intensity to obtain a rough measure of 539 cytoplasmic intensity . 540 Acknowledgments 541 We would like to thank the entire Kaksonen lab , especially Daniel Hummel , Andrea Picco , and Mateusz 542 Kozak for critical reading of this manuscript .
