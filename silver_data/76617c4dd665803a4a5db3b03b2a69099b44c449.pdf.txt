Male House Finches ( Carpodacus mexicanus ) colour their sexually selected plumage with carotenoid pigments , and there has been much interest in the factors that affect their ability to become bright red rather than drab yellow . 2 . There is good support for the notions that health , nutritional condition and total carotenoid intake inﬂuence colour expression , but there are also suggestions that acquiring particular types of carotenoids from the diet may be important for developing red plumage . 3 . We used high - performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) to analyse the types and amounts of endogenous ( in plasma and liver ) and integumentary ( in newly grown feathers ) carotenoids in a wild , native population of moulting male and female House Finches from the south - western United States to determine the carotenoid - accumulation strategies for becoming optimally colourful . 4 . Four plant carotenoids – lutein , zeaxanthin , β - cryptoxanthin and β - carotene – were detected in plasma and liver . However , as was found previously , 11 carotenoids were observed in colourful plumage , with xanthophylls ( e . g . lutein , dehydrolutein ) predom - inant in yellow feathers and ketocarotenoids ( e . g . adonirubin , 3 - hydroxy - echinenone ) in red feathers . This indicates endogenous modiﬁcation of ingested carotenoids . 5 . Birds that accumulated more of one type of carotenoid in plasma and liver did not necessarily accumulate more of all other types , suggesting that individuals are not employing a simple ‘more is better’ strategy for coloration . Instead , when forward stepwise regression was used to examine the ability of individual types of carotenoids in plasma and liver to explain variation in red plumage pigments and plumage redness , we found that the lone variable remaining in all models was β - cryptoxanthin concentration . 6 . This supports the idea that , unlike some other songbirds ( e . g . yellow Carduelis ﬁnches ) , there is a specialized biochemical strategy that male House Finches follow to become red and most sexually attractive – to accumulate as much β - cryptoxanthin in the body as possible . β - Cryptoxanthin is a less common dietary carotenoid than the typical xanthophylls and carotenes in grains and fruits and may be limited enough in the diet that , to become colourful , House Finches might adopt selective foraging strategies for the most β - cryptoxanthin - rich foods .

Numerous ﬁeld and laboratory studies demonstrate female mate choice for male House Finches with the reddest plumage ( e . g . Hill †Author to whom correspondence should be addressed .

Journal compilation © 2006 British Ecological Society , Functional Ecology , 20 , 678 – 688 1990 , 1991 ) and the associated reproductive beneﬁts ( e . g . earlier timing of breeding , increased young production ) reaped by colourful males and their mates ( Hill et al . 1994 , 1999 ; McGraw et al . 2001 ) . Moreover , a series of correlational and experimental studies indicate that males must ingest sufﬁcient amounts of carotenoids from food to become colourful ( Hill 1992 , 1993 ; Hill et al . 2002 ) as well as maintain adequate overall nutrition ( Hill & Montgomerie 1994 ; Hill 2000 ) and health ( Thompson et al . 1997 ; Brawner et al . 2000 ; Hill et al . 2004 ) during feather growth . There are indications from other work , however , that acquiring certain types of carotenoids from foods might also be critical for developing red , as opposed to yellow , coloration . Without exception , House Finches housed in captivity on a normal seed diet during moult grow yellow plumage ( Hill 1992 , 2002 ) , and it was only when additional sources of non - xanthophyll carotenoids ( e . g . synthetic red carotenoids , tangerine juice ) were added to their diet that they grew red feathers ( Hill 1992 , 2000 ) . More recent biochemical studies of the carotenoid components in House Finch feathers ( Inouye et al . 2001 ) show that important red carotenoids absent from other tissues and ﬂuids in these birds ( McGraw 2004 ) are what determine red coloration and thus must be manufactured by birds from precursor molecules not commonly available to them . Hill ( 2000 , 2002 ) speculated that it was the ability of birds to accumulate the precursors of red pigments in feathers – candidate molecules such as β - cryptoxanthin ( based on purported chemical transformations ) – that controls , at the pigment level , whether birds could acquire red plumage or not ( also see Stradi et al . 1996 for similar predictions for other red - coloured cardueline ﬁnches ) . However , to date , there are no published studies on variation in the types of carotenoids that free - ranging House Finches ingest and accumulate in the body or on the extent to which ingested carotenoids predict the pigment composition and expression of colourful plumage . We studied carotenoid accumulation strategies during moult in a native population of House Finches from the desert south - western United States . We collected blood from live birds ( to obtain a recent record of dietary - carotenoid assimilation ) , liver tissue and feathers from freshly euthanized animals , and analysed carotenoid content of all samples so that we could ask the following questions about the relationships between pigment accumulation and coloration : 1 . How do levels of different carotenoids covary within plasma or liver ? In those bird species for which the biochemical basis of carotenoid coloration has been investigated ( e . g . American Goldﬁnch [ Carduelis tristis ] , McGraw & Gregory 2004 ; Greenﬁnch [ Carduelis chloris ] , Saks et al . 2003 ) , birds tended to accumulate more of all types of carotenoids within a ﬂuid / tissue type ( e . g . plasma , feathers ) . However , if certain dietary pigments are of special value to colour production in House Finches , then levels of internal ﬂuid / tissue carotenoids should not uniformally covary . 2 . What is the relationship between plumage redness and the concentration of particular carotenoids in feathers ? As was previously done by Inouye et al . ( 2001 ) in House Finches from California and Mexico , we set out to conﬁrm which suite of carotenoids in feathers generated the reddest plumage in our study population , so that we could then target the types and amounts of carotenoids in liver and plasma with which these plumage pigments are most closely correlated . 3 . What proﬁle of plasma and liver carotenoids allows birds to accumulate the most red feather pigments ? Whether it shows that one or all types of plasma or liver carotenoids are signiﬁcantly associated with red pigment accumulation in feathers , this analysis will ultimately illustrate the endogenous strategy for carotenoid accumulation that House Finches follow for becoming sexually attractive . We also aimed to test , as secondary conﬁrmation , how well levels of plasma and liver carotenoids predicted plumage redness . 4 . Do birds that accumulate more carotenoids in plasma also accumulate more in liver ? Plasma carotenoids represent the mobile pool of pigments that are currently being delivered to peripheral tissues . The liver , in contrast , has been touted as a valuable storage site for carotenoids ( Koutsos et al . 2003 ) , and birds may draw on these stores during the moult period , such that the reddest birds are those with the lowest liver carotenoid levels but highest plasma levels . Alternatively , plasma and liver levels may be tightly correlated and reﬂect the genuine ‘high quality’ of red birds , who continue to ingest and mobilize sufﬁcient amounts for coloration while still having high tissue supplies . 5 . How do relationships between carotenoids and coloration compare between males and females and birds of different age ? Inouye et al . ( 2001 ) previously demonstrated age differences in plumage colour and feather - carotenoid content in male C . mexicanus , with hatch - year ( HY ) birds growing yellower feathers with fewer red carotenoids than after - hatch - year ( AHY ) birds . We were interested in testing whether there were parallel age differences in endogenous carotenoid pools . Moreover , all prior studies on proximate control of carotenoid colour in House Finches have focused on males , but some females also display a splash of colour on the rump that may or may not come under different regulatory mechanisms . Methods Fifty - seven moulting House Finches of known age and sex ( 3 AHY females , 7 AHY males , 24 HY females , and 23 HY males ) were captured from the wild using basket traps at baited feeding stations from 24 August 680 K . J . McGraw et al . © 2006 The Authors . Journal compilation © 2006 British Ecological Society , Functional Ecology , 20 , 678 – 688 to 27 September 2004 on the campus of Arizona State University in Tempe , Arizona , USA . At capture , approx - imately 100 µ l of blood was drawn from the brachial vein of each bird , and the plasma was centrifuged off and saved for carotenoid analysis 2 – 3 months later . The hue of newly moulted breast plumage in males and rump plumage in females was also scored at this time using a hand - held Colortron II reﬂectance spectro - photometer ( see McGraw & Hill 2000 for description and justiﬁcation ) . Birds were then rapidly euthanized , and patches of three to eight breast feathers were plucked from a standardized region on the bird and stored in the dark at room temperature prior to chemical analysis 11 – 12 months later . Carcasses were frozen at − 80 ° C for 2 – 4 days , at which time a small portion of the lower right lobe of the liver was excised , weighed and stored at − 80 ° C prior to biochemical analysis 6 – 7 months later . Carotenoid analyses followed previously published methods ( see McGraw et al . 2002 for plasma and liver , Inouye et al . 2001 for feathers ) , with the following modiﬁcations . Pigment extracts were injected into a Waters Alliance 2695 HPLC system ( Waters Corpora - tion , Milford , MA ) ﬁtted with a Waters YMC Carotenoid 5·0 µ m column ( 4·6 mm × 250 mm ) and a built - in column heater set at 30 ° C . We used a three - step gradient solvent system to analyse both xanthophylls and carotenes in a single run , at a constant ﬂow rate of 1·2 ml min − 1 : ﬁrst , isocratic elution with 42 : 42 : 16 ( v / v / v ) methanol : acetonitrile : dichloromethane for 11 min , followed by a linear gradient up to 42 : 23 : 35 ( v / v / v ) methanol : acetonitrile : dichloromethane through 21 min , held isocratically at this condition until 30 min , and ﬁnishing with a return to the initial isocratic condition from 30 to 48 min . Data were collected from 250 to 600 nm using a Waters 2996 photodiode array detector . We identiﬁed pigments by comparing their respective retention times and absorbance maxima ( λ max ) to those of reference carotenoids run as external standards . Because data on both carotenoid concentration and hue were non - normally distributed in all cases , and in most could not be transformed to meet the assumption of normality for parametric statistics ( owing to the presence of many 0 - values ) , we ran non - parametric Spearman rank correlations to determine relation - ships between : ( a ) levels of different carotenoids within blood , liver and feather samples for individual birds , ( b ) levels of different carotenoids across the ﬂuid / tissue types and ( c ) levels of carotenoids in plasma and liver vs those in feathers . We also used Wilcoxon matched - pair signed - rank tests to determine which carotenoids were most abundant in each ﬂuid / tissue . To ascertain which set of carotenoids in plasma and liver contribute to the production of red plumage pigments , we used forward stepwise regression so that we could enter all competing variables into one model . Admittedly , the use of non - normally distributed data in this regression violates an assumption of this parametric test , so we also ran Spearman rank correlations to ensure that signiﬁcant relationships still held when treated non - parametrically . Finally , we used Mann – Whitney U - tests to examine the effects of age and sex on plumage hue and on carotenoid content of plasma , liver and plumage . Unfortunately , we did not capture sufﬁcient numbers of adult birds ( seven males , three females ) to run all of the aforementioned correlational analyses separately for the age classes , but we still show data for adults when possible ( e . g . in scatterplots ) . Moreover , feathers were not collected from females , so we were unable to determine their plumage carotenoid content . Instead , we focus liver and carotenoid comparisons on plumage redness in females . Sample sizes vary in some instances due to insufﬁcient material collected from the birds for carotenoid analysis .

( 2001 ) previously characterized 13 carotenoid pigments from the colourful plumage of House Finches from California and Mexico . We found 11 of these carotenoids in freshly grown feathers from males in our Arizona population ( Fig . 2 ) ; β - cryptoxanthin and β - carotene were not detected . Based on their molecular structure and thus the hue they confer , these 11 carotenoids can be categorized into yellow forms – canary xanthophylls A and B , dehydrolutein , lutein and zeaxanthin – and red forms – astaxanthin , canthaxathin , echinenone , 3 - hydroxy - echinenone , adonirubin and 4 - oxo - rubixanthin ( Inouye et al . 2001 ) . The relative abundances of these pigments closely mirrored those found by Inouye et al . ( 2001 ) as well . 3 - Hydroxy - echinenone was the major plumage carotenoid , followed by two yellow ( lutein and dehy - drolutein ) and three red ( canthaxanthin , adonirubin and 4 - oxo - rubixanthin ) pigments ( Fig . 2 ) . Based on their absence from blood and liver ( sensu McGraw 2004 ) , it is assumed that all of the red pigments , along with dehy - drolutein , are made from dietary precursors ( those in blood and liver ) in the maturing feather follicle .       ,  ,   Concentrations of two xanthophylls – lutein and zeaxanthin – were signiﬁcantly positively correlated in male plasma and in female plasma ( Table 1 ) .

In liver , lutein and zeaxanthin concentration were also signiﬁcantly positively correlated in both sexes , as were ( a ) lutein and β - carotene and ( b ) the two less polar pigments – β - cryptoxanthin and β - carotene ( Table 1 ) .

Redder males had more of all ﬁve of these carotenoids in feathers than yellower males . Redder males also had signiﬁcantly less zeaxanthin in plumage than yellower males ( Fig . 3 ) . All of this amounted to a strong signiﬁcant relationship between plumage hue and the red : yellow pigment ratio in feathers : redder males had a higher proportion of red pigments compared with yellow pigments in feathers ( r s = − 0·82 , P < 0·0001 ) .             Clearly preferential accumulation of metabolically derived red carotenoids is the means by which House Finches become sexually attractive . This led us to test whether speciﬁc amounts of carotenoids in blood predict the concentration of red carotenoids in feathers . Because all ﬁve of the red carotenoids in plumage were so highly correlated with each other ( Table 2 ) and with plumage redness ( Fig . 3 ) , we used a principal components analysis ( PCA ) to combine these into a single variable , PC1 ( ‘plumage - pigment redness’ ) , which explained 93 % of the variation in these measures . We then entered this into stepwise multiple - regression models to test the ability of all plasma pigments and all liver pigments ( in separate analyses ) to predict the accumulation of red pigments in male feathers . We found that the best mod - els explaining variation in the concentration of the red feather pigment contained only β - cryptoxanthin ( Table 3 ) . A posteriori Spearman rank correlational analyses conﬁrmed that PC1 was signiﬁcantly correlated with β - cryptoxanthin concentration in male plasma ( r s = 0·53 , P = 0·004 ) and liver ( r s = 0·52 , P = 0·009 ) .           To determine which carotenoid proﬁles in blood and liver had direct consequences for coloration , especially Fig . 3 .

Thus , for example , birds with more lutein in blood had more lutein in liver , but did not necessarily have more of any other type of carotenoid in liver . This indicates that House Finches do not necessarily deplete stores during moult for feather pigmentation , but instead that those birds that deliver more to feathers via plasma also have higher carotenoid depots in liver . Also , it is noteworthy that the strongest correlations in each sex were between levels of β - cryptoxanthin in plasma and liver .          ,  ,   For analyses of sex , we pooled birds of all ages . We found that males and females differed only in the accumulation of plasma and liver β - cryptoxanthin and in liver β - carotene ( Fig . 5 ; recall that we could not test for sex differences in feather carotenoid content owing to the absence of data for females ) . In males , we found that AHY birds circulated more lutein and zeaxanthin in plasma than HY birds , but not more plasma β - cryptoxanthin or β - carotene or any liver carotenoid ( Fig . 6 ) . There were no signiﬁcant age differences in plumage hue or any plumage carotenoid in males , although in most cases HY birds tended to have fewer carotenoids ( and be less colourful ) than adults ( Fig . 6 ) , as was found previously ( Inouye et al . 2001 ) . We did not conduct age analyses in females because there were only three adults for which we measured plasma carotenoids and none for which we measured liver carotenoids . Discussion Studies of pigment - based coloration in animals offer unique opportunities for investigating the honesty - reinforcing mechanisms of sexual traits at the molecular level . We can ﬁrst deconstruct coloration into its pig - mentary components and then track the accumulation and production of those pigments to understand how various environmental and physiological perturbations inﬂuence pigment accumulation . House Finches have been the subject of a large majority of studies on the proximate control of carotenoid coloration in birds , but ours is the ﬁrst to track molecules internally and externally to reveal their full biochemical blueprint for coloration . It is clear from our work and that of Inouye et al . ( 2001 ) that House Finches deposit many red pigments , as opposed to yellow forms , into feathers to become sexually attractive . In this study , we were interested in determining what cocktail of carotenoids accumulated in the body allows males to incorporate high concen - trations of red carotenoids in feathers . We found several lines of evidence that point to a valuable role for endogenous sources of β - cryptoxanthin in the production of red plumage in House Finches : ( 1 ) unlike some of the other carotenoids in the body ( e . g . lutein Table 3 .

Hill ( 2000 ) has also shown that birds fed diets rich in lutein and zeaxanthin turn only yellow , but grow red feathers when fed β - cryptoxanthin - rich foods ( e . g . tangerine juice ) . Such a specialized biochemical strategy for developing elaborate coloration – the preferential accumulation of one type of carotenoid – is rare among songbirds ( also see Stradi et al . 2001 for other hypothesized ﬁnch species ) , as prior studies have shown that the most colorful birds accumulate more of all types of carotenoids in the body and feathers ( e . g . Saks et al . 2003 ; McGraw & Gregory 2004 ) . β - Cryptoxanthin is a relatively scarce pigment in nature compared with other potential dietary - precursor carotenoids such as lutein , zeaxanthin and β - carotene ( Goodwin 1980 , 1984 ) , and its distribution in both space and time may explain why not all House Finches accumulate large amounts to become red . House Finches moult at the end of and after the monsoon rains in the desert south - west , at which point several localized desert plants , including prickly pear ( Opuntia sp . ) and Saguaro ( Carnegeia gigantean ) cacti ( Steenburgh & Lowe 1977 ) , produce colourful red fruits . Moulting House Finches in Arizona have been observed for - aging on these fruits in late summer , and preliminary chemical analyses of these fruits indicate that they contain β - cryptoxanthin ( K . J . McGraw , P . M . Nolan & O . L . Crino , unpublished data ) . It is thus conceivable that locating and foraging on such fruits is a major dietary challenge that native populations of house ﬁnches face for becoming colourful .

Still , it is apparent that some males do not require high levels of β - cryptoxanthin for becoming red . This is most evident in Fig . 4 , where an L - shaped curve indicates that , while yellow plumage is always the product of low β - cryptoxanthin supplies , some birds become red with either low or high β - cryptoxanthin levels . This was especially true among older birds , which ( albeit in a limited sample ) all had relatively low cryptoxanthin concentrations ( Figs 4 and 6b ) but still grew red plumage . Inouye et al . ( 2001 ) similarly found that correlations between red carotenoids and plumage colour broke down among older males . Recall that β - cryptoxanthin is the metabolic precursor to the important red carotenoid pigments ( e . g . 3 - hydroxy - echinenone ) in plumage , and as suggested by several prior studies some males better than others must also complete these important metabolic , condition - dependent conversions en route to becoming sexually attractive ( e . g . Hill 2000 ) . Our results hint at a potential age difference in proximate control of male colour , whereby the variability in HY plumage colour is controlled more by diet and the variability among adults controlled more by metabolic activity . This is the ﬁrst biochemical study of the carotenoid coloration strategies of wild female House Finches . The incidence of red coloration in females is much lower than in males ( e . g . < 5 % of all females in our population ; K . J . McGraw , P . M . Nolan & O . L . Crino , unpublished data ) , and the fact that females had dramatically less plasma and liver β - cryptoxanthin than males may explain this . Still , as with males , we show that β - cryptoxanthin concentrations in liver and plasma also strongly predict plumage redness in females . In fact , the relationship between β - cryptoxanthin and colour appeared to be even more linear in females than Fig . 5 . Sex differences in plasma and liver carotenoids in moulting wild House Finches . Non - parametric Mann – Whitney U - tests were used to compare concentrations of each carotenoid between males and females ; statistically signiﬁcant results are in bold . n = 22 females and 26 males in analyses of liver , n = 25 females and 30 males in analyses of plasma .

Journal compilation © 2006 British Ecological Society , Functional Ecology , 20 , 678 – 688 in males ( Fig . 4 ) , pointing to even tighter dependence on the dietary precursor , perhaps with less inﬂuence of metabolism or general nutrition . Note that this analysis was conducted largely among HY females , who are redder and potentially have a greater need for mate attraction than already - mated AHY females ( which often retain mates across seasons ; Hill 2002 ) . We await future studies to determine whether AHY females are less red in colour owing to their levels of dietary precursor or enzyme activity . Although primacy is given to β - cryptoxanthin for coloration in House Finches here , this should by no means undermine the importance of accumulating other carotenoids in the body for other functions . Different carotenoids can serve a diverse suite of endogenous biological roles , including antioxidant defence / immunoregulation , UV protection , visual ﬁltering and vitamin synthesis in offspring ( from egg yolk ) and adults ( Vershinin 1999 ) . For example , lutein and zeaxanthin can act as immunostimulants in songbirds ( e . g . Blount et al . 2003 ; McGraw & Ardia 2003 ; Saino et al . 2003 ; but see Navara & Hill 2003 ) , whereas the cryptoxanthins and carotenes , but not xanthophylls , have pro - vitamin - A activity ( Bauern - feind 1981 ) . Investigating these various functions of carotenoids , both during moult and at other times of year , will shed additional light on how and why birds displayed such high variability in their ﬂuid - and tissue - carotenoid proﬁles in this study . Ultimately , several environmental and physiological factors inﬂuence colour expression in House Finches ( Hill 2002 ) . These include parasites ( Brawner et al . 2000 ) , general nutrition ( Hill & Montgomerie 1994 ; Hill 2000 ) and hormone titres ( Stoehr & Hill 2001 ) , in addition to the amounts ( Hill et al . 2002 ) and types of dietary carotenoids . Because we did not gather data on health status or other measures of individual quality in these birds , future studies should be geared at disen - tangling the relative effects of these different variables on carotenoid accumulation and coloration in both captive and wild settings ( Hill 2006 ) .
