Gangliosides as Receptors for Biological Toxins : Development of Sensitive Fluoroimmunoassays Using Ganglioside - Bearing Liposomes Anup K . Singh , * Suzanne H . Harrison , and Joseph S . Schoeniger Chemical & RadiationDetectionLaboratory , SandiaNationalLaboratories , Livermore , California94550 Gangliosides , glycosphingolipids present in the mem - branes of neuronal and other cells , are natural receptors for a number of bacterial toxins and viruses whose sensitive detection is of interest in clinical medicine as well as in biological warfare or terrorism incidents . Liposomes containing gangliosides mimic cells that are invaded by bacterial toxins and can be used as sensitive probes for detecting these toxins . We discuss detection of three bacterial toxins s tetanus , botulinum , and cholera toxins using ganglioside - bearing liposomes . Tetanus and botulinum toxins selectively bind gangliosides of the G1b series , namely , GT1b , GD1b , and GQ1b ; and cholera toxin binds GM1 very specifically . Unilamellar liposomes containing GT1b or GM1 as one of the constituent lipids were prepared by extrusion through polycarbonate mem - branes . To impart signal generation capability to these liposomes , fluorophore - labeled lipids were incorporated in the bilayer of liposomes . The fluorescent liposomes , containing both a marker ( rhodamine ) and a receptor ( GT1b or GM1 ) in the bilayer , were used in sandwich fluoroimmunoassays for tetanus , botulinum , and cholera toxins and as low as 1 nM of each toxin could be detected . The apparent dissociation constants of liposome - toxin complexes were in 10 - 8 M range , indicating strong binding . This is the first report on detection of tetanus and botulinum toxins based on specific recognition by gangliosides . The fluorescent liposomes are attractive as immunoreagents for another reason as well s they provide enormous signal amplification for each binding event as each liposome contains up to 22 000 rhodamine mol - ecules . The present approach using receptors incorpo - rated in bilayers of liposomes offers a unique solution to employ water - insoluble receptors , such as glycolipids and membrane proteins , for sensitive detection of toxins and other clinically important biomolecules . Bacterial toxins and viruses are often specifically targeted to certain cell types that exhibit characteristic binding sites or specific receptors on their surfaces . The mechanism of cell intoxication by bacterial protein toxins begins with binding of toxin to a cell surface receptor . After binding to the receptor , part or all of the toxin penetrates and , in some cases , is translocated across the bilayer membrane to the inside of the cell where the toxic effect is manifested . 1 The majority of known receptors for bacterial exotoxins are carbohydrates , in the form of either glycolipids or glycoproteins . 2 , 3 Carbohydrates have long been known as biologi - cal receptors , binding of lectins to carbohydrates being the paradigm for protein - sugar interaction . 4 Gangliosides , a type of glycolipid , have been implicated in many cellular functions including cell - cell recognition , interactions with extracellular proteins , receptor for hormones , receptor for viruses such as influenza and Sendai , and receptors for toxins such as cholera , tetanus , and botulinum . 5 - 7 Botulinum and tetanus toxins have been determined to bind selectively to gangliosides of the series “G1b” , namely , GT1b , GD1b , and GQ1b , 8 - 10 which are present in neuronal cell membranes . Cholera toxin binds very specifically and strongly to cell surface via ganglioside GM1 found on the surface of enterocytes and many other eukaryotic cell types . 10 - 12 Figure 1 shows the structures of gangliosides GM1 and GT1b . They are composed of a hydrophobic ceramide backbone and an oligosac - charide polar headgroup containing neutral sugars ( glucose , galactose , N - acetylgalactosamine ) and an anionic sugar sialic acid . 13 Binding of a toxin molecule to ganglioside involves recognition of an internal sequence of sugars on the saccharide chain , the number of sialic acid residues and their relative positions being the predominant factors . This feature ensures the specificity of binding as glycolipids not only need to contain the required sugars , they should be presented in the correct order and conformation . Table 1 presents a list of microbial toxins and their receptors . By no means is this a comprehensive list but rather a few examples to elucidate the universality of toxin - glycolipid binding . * Corresponding author : ( e - mail ) aksingh @ sandia . gov ; ( phone ) 925 - 294 - 1260 ; ( fax ) 925 - 294 - 3020 .

They have gener - ally poor solubility in water owing to their hydrophobic ceramide chain , prohibiting their use as a reagent . Another reason is that , being small molecules , they do not offer many sites for covalent attachment without disrupting their activity . This makes it impractical to conjugate them to a biosensor surface or to label such as enzymes or fluorophores . But , being amphiphilic , they can readily be incorporated in self - assembled lipid structures such as liposomes or planar lipid films . This obviates any need for covalent conjugation and also presents glycolipids in a native environment . Polydiacetylene Langmuir - Blodgett films and lip - osomes functionalized with sialic acid ( a receptor for influenza virus ) or GM1 ( a receptor for cholera toxin ) that undergo color change upon binding of corresponding analytes have been used for biosensing before . 14 Selective multivalent binding of GM1 to cholera toxin has also been exploited to develop sensitive biosensors based on resonance - energy transfer and self - quenching of fluorescence . 15 Although , there has been a number of reports on detection of cholera toxin using GM1 , ganglioside - toxin binding has not been extended to detection of other toxins such as tetanus and botulinum toxins . Botulinum neurotoxin is produced by the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium botulinum and is the most toxic substance known : (cid:24) 100 billion times more toxic than cyanide and (cid:24) 1 million times more poisonous than cobra toxin . 16 It acts on nerve endings to block aceytlcholine release leading to flaccid muscular paralysis . Tetanus toxin , produced by bacterium Clostridium tetani , binds to nerve cells , penetrates the cytosol , and blocks neurotransmitter release causing spastic paralysis . Both tetanus and botulinum toxins consist of a single polypeptide chain of (cid:24) 150 kDa . Proteolytic cleavage yields two chains , light ( 50 kDa ) and heavy ( 100 kDa ) , that are linked by a single disulfide bridge . 17 The C - terminal of the heavy chain , referred to as C fragment , is involved in binding to nerve cells using gangliosides as receptors . Cholera is an enterotoxigenic illness elicited by Vibrio cholerae and is characterized by a watery diarrhea leading to life - threaten - ing dehydration and loss of electrolytes . Cholera toxin ( CT ) is an oligomeric protein of two distinct domains , CT - A ( 27 kDa ) and CT - B ( 58 kDa ) . CT - B is responsible for toxin binding to cell surface via ganglioside GM1 . 10 - 12 It is a pentamer of five identical polypeptides , and each unit binds to one GM1 molecule . Hence , CT can form up to a pentavalent bond with a cell surface leading to a very strong interaction . In this paper , we discuss detection of three bacterial toxins s tetanus , botulinum , and cholera toxins using ganglioside - bearing liposomes . To impart signal - generation capability to these lipo - somes , rhodamine - labeled lipids were incorporated in their bilayer . An alternate way of incorporating signal molecules is their encapsulation in the aqueous core of a liposome , but their leakage upon storage is a serious concern . The fluorescent liposomes were used in heterogeneous sandwich immunoassays for detection of the bacterial toxins . Although binding of gangliosides to toxins is quite strong , in many cases one ganglioside binds to multiple toxins of the same family . For example , gangliosides of the G1b series bind to tetanus as well as botulinum toxin , and conse - quently , it is not possible to differentiate between the two toxins based on binding to ganglioside GT1b alone . In the present work , for positive identification of each toxin , we have employed a “sandwich” approach where toxin is first captured by a monoclonal ( 14 ) Charych , D . H . ; Nagy , J .

GM1 is the specific receptor for cholera toxin , and GT1b is a natural receptor for tetanus and botulinum toxins .

Liposomes containing receptors and markers described here offer a number of advantages as immunoreagents . ( 1 ) They make it possible for water - insoluble receptors such as glycolipids , sterols , and integral membrane proteins to be used in immunoassays and biosensing . ( 2 ) They provide a native environment to these lipophilic receptors thereby maximizing their activity and extend - ing their shelf life . ( 3 ) Liposomes have a large surface area and internal volume where thousands of reporter molecules such as fluorescent dyes can be immobilized or entrapped . This leads to large signal amplification for each binding event . 18 - 20 EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Materials . Gangliosides GT1b , GQ1b , and GM1 ; lipids L - R - distearoylphosphatidylcholine ) ( DSPC ) and L - R - dimyristoylphos - phatidylethanolamine ) ( DMPE ) ; and cholesterol were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co . ( St . Louis , MO ) . Fluorophore - labeled lipids rhodamine - DHPE ( N - ( lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl ) - 1 , 2 - dihexadecanoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoethanolamine ) were obtained from Molecular Probes , Inc . ( Eugene , OR ) . To avoid the exposure hazard associated with the use of intact toxin , we used com - mercially available recombinant fragments of toxins ( fragments containing ganglioside - binding domain ) for this study . The re - combinant toxin fragments do not exhibit any native toxicity and , hence , do not pose any health concerns . Recombinant tetanus toxin C fragment and a monoclonal antibody against it were supplied by Boehringer Manheim Corp . ( Indianapolis , IN ) . Cholera toxin B subunit was obtained from Sigma , and the monoclonal antibody against it was purcahsed from BioDesign Laboratories ( Kennebunk , ME ) . Botulinum toxin C fragment and the antibody against it were supplied by Ophidian Pharmaceuticals ( Madison , WI ) . Bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) , casein , and gelatin were obtained from Sigma . Preparation of GTIb and GM1 Liposomes . Unilamellar liposomes were prepared by extrusion through polycarbonate membranes as described elsewhere . 18 Stock solutions of lipids , gangliosides , and cholesterol were prepared in 2 : 1 chloroform / methanol ( v / v ) mixture . A 60 - mg sample of lipids was mixed in the mole ratio of 42 . 5 : 42 . 5 : 10 : 5 ( DSPC / cholesterol / rhodamine - DHPE / GT1b or GM1 ) in a 25 - mL round - bottomed flask . The flask was connected to a rotary evaporator , and the lipid solution was dried thoroughly under vacuum to form a thin lipid film on the inside wall of the flask . Filtered and degassed buffer , either 50 mM citrate buffer at pH 6 . 0 or phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) at pH 7 . 4 , was added to the dried lipids . The flask was submerged in a water bath at 60 (cid:176) C and rotated vigorously to form multila - mellar vesicles ( MLVs ) . The MLV suspension was sonicated briefly in a bath sonicator to reduce the average size of the liposomes . This solution was then loaded into the syringe of a pneumatic automatic liposome extruder ( Liposofast , Avestin , Inc . , Vancouver , Canada ) and extruded 31 times through two stacked 100 - nm polycarbonate filters . The resulting unilamellar liposomes were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 min to remove residual multilamellar vesicles and aggregated lipids . The liposome solution was stored at 4 (cid:176) C until further use . Characterization of Liposomes . Hydrodynamic diameters of unilamellar liposomes were estimated by dynamic light scattering ( DLS ) using a commercial device ( Zeta Plus , Brookhaven Instru - ments Corp . ) . The liposome suspension was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min prior to size measurement to remove dust particles and aggregated lipid structures . Samples for size measurement were prepared by adding 25 (cid:237) L of liposome to 2 mL of 10 mM phosphate ( pH 7 . 2 ) . The solution was filtered using a 0 . 2 - (cid:237) m syringe filter and dispensed into a clean plastic cuvette . Measure - ments were performed at a 90 (cid:176) scattering angle using a 633 - nm diode laser , and correlation function was generated by a BI - 9000AT digital correlator . The data were analyzed using the constrained regularization method , 21 resulting in a size distribution character - ized by a mean diameter and variance . The œ potential of the liposome suspension was measured by electrophoretic light scattering ( ZetaPlus , Brookhaven Instruments ) , which is based on the scattering of light from particles that move in a liquid under the influence of an applied electric field . Liposomes were diluted in a 10 mM KCl solution for the measurement of œ potential . Liposome concentration , number of receptors ( GT1b ) per liposome , and number of rhodamines per liposome were deter - mined as explained elsewhere . 18 Briefly , 25 (cid:237) L of liposomes was added to a quartz cuvette containing 1 . 5 mL of methanol and 20 (cid:237) L of 0 . 1 N NaOH . The absorbance of this solution was measured at 560 nm to estimate the concentration of rhodamine - DHPE using an extinction coefficient of 95 000 M - 1 cm - 1 . Since the mole percentage of rhodamine - DHPE is known , the total lipid concen - tration can be determined . Knowing the size of a liposome and the projected headgroup areas of the constituent lipids , the number of lipids in spherical unilamellar liposome , N tot , can be estimated as where t is the bilayer thickness , d the hydrodynamic diameter , and a L is the average headgroup area per lipid . The bilayer thickness was assumed to be 40 Å , and a L was calculated using values of 71 , 41 , and 19 Å 2 for phosphatidylcholine , phosphatidy - ( 18 ) Singh , A . K . ; Kilpatrick , P .

The headgroup area of rhodamine - DHPE was assumed to be the same as ethanolamine . The value of a L for liposomes was 44 . 8 Å 2 / lipid . Liposome concentration in solution can be calculated by dividing the total lipid concentration by N tot . Fluoroimmunoassay for Tetanus , Botulinum , and Cholera Toxins . The inner 60 wells of a 96 - well Immulon 4 plate were coated with monoclonal anti - tetanus toxin C fragment , monoclonal anti - botulinum A toxin C fragment , or monoclonal anti - cholera toxin B subunit for assays for tetanus , botulinum , and cholera toxin fragments , respectively . Coating solution ( 150 (cid:237) L ) containing 10 (cid:237) g / mL antibody in 50 mM carbonate / bicarbonate buffer ( pH 9 . 6 ) was dispensed in each well . After being covered with a plate sealer , the plate was incubated at 4 (cid:176) C on a plate shaker at 600 rpm for 18 h . The coating solution was aspirated using an automated plate washer ( Biotek Instruments ) , and the wells were blocked with 300 (cid:237) L / well of 1 wt % BSA ( RIA grade ) for 3 h at 4 (cid:176) C . The wells were washed with PBS twice and then exposed to dilutions of the appropriate toxin fragment or buffer ( control ) . After incubation at 37 (cid:176) C for 1 h , wells were washed with PBS four times . Liposome solution was dispensed into the wells , and the microtiter plate was incubated again for 1 - 2 h at 37 (cid:176) C . Wells were washed six times with PBS to remove the unbound and nonspecifically bound liposomes . Lysis buffer containing a detergent , Triton X - 100 at 10 mM in borate buffer ( pH 9 ) , was added , and the plate was shaken on the plate shaker for 15 min at 600 rpm . The fluorescence signal was read in a fluorescence plate reader ( Cambridge Instruments , Watertown , MA ) using an excitation filter of 550 nm and emission filter of 580 nm . Nonspecific Binding Experiments . To reduce the nonspe - cific binding of toxins and liposomes in the immunoassays , the following parameters were optimized : blocking protein , coating buffer , wash buffer , type of microtiter plate , diluents for the different steps , and incubation time . The optimum choice of these parameters is dependent on the antigen - receptor system being considered , and hence , these studies had to be repeated for each toxin . Various concentrations and grades of casein , BSA , and gelatin were considered as blocking proteins and diluents . The different polystyrene microtiter plates tested to maximize antibody adsorption and minimize well - to - well variations were Costar high binding ( Corning Costar , Cambridge , MA ) , Immulon high binding 3 and 4 ( Dynatech Laboratories , Chantily , VA ) , and Nunc Max - isorp ( Nalge Nunc International , Rochester , NY ) . Different incuba - tion times and temperatures were tested for incubating the wells with monoclonal antibodies , toxins , and liposomes to maximize signal - to - noise ratio . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Properties of Fluorescent Liposomes . Fluorescent lipo - somes were prepared with the ganglioside receptor for tetanus toxin , botulinum toxin , or cholera toxin incorporated in the bilayer together with phospholipids ( DHPE ) conjugated with a marker rhodamine . Liposomes had hydrodynamic diameters of 120 - 130 nm and contained about 9500 - 11 000 ganglioside molecules and 19 000 - 22 000 rhodamine molecules . Table 2 lists the physical properties of liposomes . At neutral pH , the sialic acids in the headgroup of GT1b or GM1 and rhodamine moieties in rhodamine - DHPE are negatively charged . Since DSPC and cholesterol ( the other constituents of bilayer ) are zwitterionic and uncharged , respectively , at neutral pH ; liposomes carry a net negative charge and are stabilized by electrostatic repulsion in a suspension . Liposome stability was monitored by measuring the hydrody - anamic diameter and the lipid loss , and no significant change ( < 5 % ) was observed over one year . For long - term storage , liposomes were suspended in the same buffer that was used for preparing them to ensure that osmolarity of the solutions inside and outside of a liposome is the same . This avoids osmotic pressure - induced size changes such as swelling and bursting of liposomes . GT1b in the total lipids was always maintained at less than 5 mol % as its large headgroup may destabilize liposomes . Each liposome carried (cid:24) 10 000 ganglioside molecules , probably well in excess of what is required for binding to a toxin molecule . But , since one liposome , owing to its size , can bind to multiple toxin molecules simultaneously , ganglioside density was kept high . Multivalent binding can lead to significantly higher binding constants , 23 allowing smaller concentrations to be detected . The concentration of rhodamine - DHPE was kept to a maximum of 15 % . Theoretically , it is possible to increase signal generated by a liposome by incorporating higher concentrations of rhodamine - DHPE , but incorporation of higher concentrations of rhodamine - DHPE in the bilayer resulted in unstable liposomes . It has been reported that phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) , owing to its smaller headgroup , prefers to form planar bilayers rather than curved ones and its presence in large concentrations can destabilize a spherical liposome . 24 Fluorescence Quenching in Liposomes . The rhodamine molecules in the liposomes are present in relatively high surface concentration and undergo self - quenching . There have been a number of mechanisms postulated for self - quenching of rhodamine at high concentrations including formation of nonfluorescent dimer , energy transfer from monomer to dimer , and collisional quenching . With rhodamine - DHPE , the collisional quenching can be ruled out as the fluors are too far apart to collide within a fluorescence lifetime of a few nanoseconds . 25 Therefore , formation of a nonfluorescent dimer and energy transfer without emission to the dimers account for the concentration quenching of rhodamine in liposomes . 25 , 26 The extent of quenching was deter - mined by lysing ( and hence diluting ) liposomes with the nonionic ( 22 ) Israelachvili , J .

The liposome concentration was main - tained constant at 20 (cid:237) M total lipids , and the surfactant concentra - tion was increased from 0 to 20 mM . The results are presented in Figure 3 . The intact liposomes yielded a signal 30 times lower than the case in which liposomes were completely disrupted , indicating that rhodamine molecules were quenched by up to 97 % in an intact liposome . Hence the fluorescent liposomes , when used in an immunoassay , need to be disrupted prior to signal measure - ment to maximize the fluorescence signal . Figure 3 shows the fluorescence dequenching of liposomes upon addition of a sur - factant . The initial increase in fluorescence upon surfactant addition is gradual until the critical micellar concentration ( cmc ) of Triton X - 100 ( 0 . 22 mM ) is reached . Dequenching in this region results from the intercalation of surfactant monomers into lipo - somes , which decreases the average surface concentration of rhodamine - DHPE . As the concentration of surfactant is increased beyond the cmc , liposomes begin to break apart to form micelles leading to a rapid dilution of rhodamine - DHPE molecules . This region is marked by a rapid increase in the fluorescence signal . Once the surfactant concentration is large enough to solubilize a majority of the liposomes , increase in fluorescence upon surfactant addition is marginal . Finally , a saturation point is reached at a Triton X - 100 concentration of (cid:24) 10 mM at which the fluors are completely dequenched . On the basis of these findings , 10 mM Triton X - 100 was used to disrupt liposomes prior to fluorescence measurement in the sandwich immunoassay . Nonspecific Binding of Liposomes . Liposomes , depending on their composition and groups present on the outer surface , can exhibit high nonspecific binding to proteins and hydrophobic surfaces . 26 Although , liposomes have a very hydrophilic exterior , in the presence of highly hydrophobic surfaces the spherical bilayer can unravel , thereby exposing the hydrophobic lipid tails . This feature has been used advantageously to deposit lipid bilayers on hydrophobic surfaces by incubating them with liposomes . 28 Proteins can adsorb to liposomes by insertion of hydrophobic segments in the bilayer or by electrostatic attraction if liposomes are charged . 29 , 30 BSA ( 1 wt % in PBS , pH 7 . 4 , RIA grade ) performed the best as a blocking agent to minimize adsorption of liposomes ( and toxin proteins ) to hydrophobic polystyrene wells . BSA has a p I of (cid:24) 4 . 9 and hence at pH 7 . 4 adsorbed BSA on polystyrene is negatively charged . Since the liposomes used were negatively charged ( œ potential (cid:24) - 40 mV , Table 2 ) , electrostatic repulsion is a probable cause of low nonspecific binding to a BSA - treated surface . BSA ( 0 . 1 % in PBS ) was also added to the buffer used to make dilutions of toxins and liposomes to reduce NSB during incubation steps . Immulon high - binding 4 microtiter plates per - formed the best in obtaining reproducible and high antibody loadings . Fluoroimmunoassays for Tetanus , Botulinum , and Chol - era Toxins . GT1b - bearing fluorescent liposomes were used in heterogeneous sandwich immunoassays for detection of the C fragment of tetanus and botulinum toxins . For detection of the B subunit of cholera toxin , GM1 - bearing fluorescent liposomes were used . Panels a - c of Figure 4 show the results of sandwich immunoassays for detection of tetanus toxin , botulinum toxin , and cholera toxin , respectively . The concentration of liposomes used in an assay was kept sufficiently high to bind all toxin molecules even at the highest toxin concentration and was determined by binding - isotherm experiments ( data not shown ) . In Figure 4 , the fluorescence signal in the immunoassays increases with increasing toxin concentration until a saturation point is reached at high toxin concentrations . The saturated fluorescence signal is reached when either ( 1 ) the entire population of antibody sites is saturated with toxin or ( 2 ) the entire well surface is covered with a monolayer of liposomes . In the present case , the later scenario is more likely and hence , if desired , the upper bound of the working assay range can be extended by using a lower concentration of liposomes . The fluorescence versus toxin concentration plots have a sigmoidal shape , typical of a sandwich immunoassay . The data were fit by a four - parameter logistic model of the form 31 where F is the fluorescence signal and x is the toxin concentration . (cid:226) 1 and (cid:226) 2 are the asymptotic signals as x f 0 and x f ¥ , respectively . (cid:226) 3 is the predicted concentration at the response halfway between the two asymptotes , and (cid:226) 4 is related to the slope . The logistic model fit the experimental data reasonably well as indicated by the R 2 values of 0 . 996 , 0 . 998 , and 0 . 993 for the assays for tetanus , botulinum and cholera toxins , respectively . For quantitation of immunoassays , the minimum detectable concentra - tion ( MDC ) was defined as the lowest concentration of analyte that results in an expected fluorescence signal that is two standard deviations higher than the mean response at zero concentration . The MDC values were in the nanomolar range for all three toxins as listed in Table 3 . (cid:226) 3 can be used 32 as the apparent dissociation ( 27 ) Jones , M . N . Curr . Opin .

Rhodamine molecules are up to 97 % quenched in intact liposomes . Disruption of liposomes by a surfactant leads to dequenching of fluorescence . The steep rise in fluorescence ( indicat - ing onset of liposome lysis ) begins when surfactant concentration reaches the critical micellar concentration ( 0 . 22 mM for Triton X - 100 ) .

The apparent dissociation constants are in the 10 - 8 M range , indicating relatively strong binding of ganglioside - bearing liposomes to toxins . CONCLUSIONS In the ever - advancing field of biosensors and immunoassays , there is always a desire for flexibility in the types of ligands that can be used for molecular recognition . Proteins , especially antibodies , have been the receptor of choice for most applications . Recently , researchers have started to explore alternative receptors such as combinatorial peptides and aptamers . Glycolipids have long been known as receptors for a variety of biological molecules but have not been used extensively in development of biosensors and immunoassays . The major reasons are their low solubility in water and their small size , which makes it impractical to do any covalent modification without adversely affecting their binding . But glycolipids can easily be incorporated in self - assembled structures such as liposomes . Liposomes possess a number of features that make them attractive as assay reagents . They provide a large internal volume and outer surface area where molecules can be entrapped or attached ; they provide a very flexible , cell membranelike environment where biological molecules can maintain their native conformation ; they form a stable suspension in water ; and they can be tailor - made to offer sites for covalent chemistry or decrease nonspecific binding . We prepared lipo - somes containing gangliosides ( receptors for bacterial toxins ) to develop sensitive immunoassays for these toxins . Signal genera - tion was achieved by incorporating thousands of fluorophore - lipid conjugates in liposomes . The fluorescent liposomes were employed for detection of tetanus , botulinum , and cholera toxins and as low as 1 nM of each toxin could be detected . Furthermore , as these liposomes do not contain any protein component , they have vastly superior shelf life than antibody - marker conjugates typically used in immunoassays and biosensors . The present approach offers a generic platform to employ membrane receptors in biosensing and immunoassays . Many bacterial toxins and viruses use lipids and membrane proteins on a cell surface as their specific receptors . Consequently , liposomes containing suitable lipids or membrane proteins can be used as sensitive probes for a variety of analytes of significance in clinical diagnostics , food quality monitoring , and biological warfare reagent detection .
