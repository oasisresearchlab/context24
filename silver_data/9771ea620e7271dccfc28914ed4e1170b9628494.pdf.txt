The linkage between knowledge accumulation capability and organizational innovation Su - Chao Chang and Ming - Shing Lee Abstract Purpose – The main purpose of this paper is to explore the effect of knowledge accumulation capability on organizational innovation . This study also attempts to ﬁnd if interaction between external environment or organizational culture and knowledge accumulation ability will inﬂuence organizational innovation . Design / methodology / approach – A quantitative research design was employed . A total of 1 , 000 questionnaires were mailed out and received 129 valid replies . Findings – The research results indicate that the capability to obtain knowledge can positively and signiﬁcantly affect knowledge administrative and technical innovation . Knowledge expansion capability can positively and signiﬁcantly affect administrative innovation . In addition , external environment and organizational culture have signiﬁcant interaction effects with knowledge accumulation capability on organizational innovation . Research limitations / implications – This research discussed only some organizational layers like knowledge accumulation , external environment and organizational culture without any further research efforts aimed at any other facets . Practical implications – With the rapid change of markets and the intense industry competition , business management is deeply affected by any change in the external environment . Originality / value – Because there is no existing literature on the use of external environment and organizational culture as moderators to explore the effect of knowledge accumulation capability on organizational innovation , this paper provides a basis for future studies that examine the relationship between these factors . Keywords Knowledge management , Organizational innovation , Organizational culture , Taiwan Paper type Research paper Introduction With the rapid improvements in technology and the volatile economic environment , knowledge management has become a necessary and critical part in the enhancement of a ﬁrm’s competence . In this environment of rapid changes and uncertainty , where the demands of the markets keep changing , the only way for an organization to make a breakthrough and obtain a competitive advantage is through knowledge accumulation . Creative vigor is precisely what ﬁrms require if they want to improve continuously ( Kanter , 1984 ) . There are numerous leading ﬁrms which have made innovation their business strategy ( Burns and Napier , 1994 ) . Under today’s conditions of dynamic global competition , the leading innovative organizations are those that show a higher level of adaptability and survival capability ( Robbins , 2003 ) . Hamel and Skarzynski ( 2001 ) proposed a First Law of the Innovation Economy : if ﬁrms cannot maintain a constant level of innovation , then they will be defeated by the economic environment . An innovative strategy is the only way to cope with the problem caused by intermittent changes . Slater and Narver ( 1995 ) further proposed that innovation of the core activities must be correlated with the orientation and performance of the lead market . The level of relevant knowledge accumulation , organizational innovation , and even organizational culture and performance are all deeply affected by the environment DOI 10 . 1108 / 13673270810852359 VOL . 12 NO . 1 2008 , pp . 3 - 20 , Q Emerald Group Publishing Limited , ISSN 1367 - 3270 j JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT j PAGE 3 Su - Chao Chang is a Professor and Ming - Shing Lee is a PhD candidate , both based at the Graduate Institute of Business Administration , National Cheng Kung University , Tainan , Taiwan ( ROC ) .

Glueck ( 1976 ) stated that when a ﬁrm’s executives wish to conduct effective business management , they should monitor the external factors to their business , since business growth and development are closely affected by the external environment . Firms must keep control of , and predict the changing directions of different variables within their environment , and they must thoroughly understand the effects of the environment on their ﬁrms . McDermott and O’Dell ( 2001 ) contend that in an organization with a knowledge sharing culture , people would share ideas and insights because they see it as nature , rather than something they are forced to do . Davenport and Klahr ( 1998 ) proposed that one of the more important success factors of knowledge management systems is the friendly culture of knowledge application . However , for ﬁrms lacking this culture , it may be quite difﬁcult to establish it . They also believe that within this friendly culture of knowledge application , experience , professional levels and the need for rapid innovation will in the end replace the authority of position with the authority of profession . Therefore this study is focused on investigating the effect of knowledge accumulation on an organization’s innovation , and our research models include the organizational culture as well as external environment variables . The authors hope that by investigating the four items of external environment , organizational culture , knowledge accumulation and organizational innovation , this research can provide some insights to ﬁrms to make efﬁcient use of their organization’s knowledge . So that when they are facing the new era of economic knowledge they can enhance the performance of their organization through innovation . It will allow them to understand the activities ﬁrms must implement to manage their knowledge . It will help them to properly adjust for and coordinate between their external environment and their organizational culture in order to establish a favorable environment for innovation within their organization . Based upon the above research motivations , this study intends to determine the answer to the following questions : B What is the effect of knowledge accumulation on organizational innovation ? B Is the correlation between knowledge accumulation and organizational innovation affected by the external environment ? B Is the correlation between knowledge accumulation and organizational innovation affected by the organizational culture ? Literature review The capability of knowledge accumulation The core value of a business in the future will be its capability of knowledge management ( Gates , 1999 ) . Knowledge will be the very core part of business competence ( Drucker , 1993 ; Prahalad and Hamel , 1990 ) . The advantages of continual competition depend upon the efﬁciency of knowledge integration ( Grant , 1996 ) . Drucker ( 1993 ) proposes that knowledge is not only the advantage resource of business but also the sole resource of advantage . Ordinarily organizational productivity depends on techniques , procedures and in - depth human knowledge ( Badaracco , 1991 ) . O’Dell et al . ( 1998 ) suggested that the knowledge of an organization is used to carry out organizational tasks . Tofﬂer ( 1990 ) submitted that knowledge will become the ﬁnal substitute for any other resource . Thus , to enhance the competitive advantage , it is necessary to make more effective use of intellectual properties among organizations , improve the knowledge procedures of the members of the organization and to encourage employees to continually contribute to the knowledge share ( Villadsen , 1995 ; Stewart , 1997 ) . The ability to make good use of knowledge and appropriately manage and apply this of knowledge internally within a ﬁrm has become the main criteria for business competition ( Prahalad and Hamel , 1990 ; Leonard - Barton , 1995 ) . PAGE 4 j JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT j VOL . 12 NO . 1 2008 The deﬁnition of knowledge management Hanley and Dawson ( 2000 ) contends that knowledge management means a collecting procedure for effectively conducting the creation , expansion and effect of knowledge for the purpose of realizing the goals of the organization . They also proposed that knowledge management means a series of collections to demonstrate the organizational designs , together with the principles of business management , procedures , organizational structures and applicable techniques . He suggests that it can help employees to demonstrate their creativity and capability with amazing efﬁciency to create business values . Knowledge management ensures that the correct knowledge is transmitted to the members that need it , in a timely and appropriate manner to help these members take the appropriate actions to continually enhance the performance of the organization ( O’Dell et al . , 1998 ) . In other words , it is the exact timing of receiving and transmitting the correct information to the right employees that will provide the competitive advantage to the company ( Roberts , 2000 ) . Providing correct knowledge to the right places at the right time is an essential requirement for the introduction of knowledge management procedures . It collects , shares , creates and renews the organization’s knowledge and creates a systematic management method for making the organization’s properties available to employees in order to create a knowledge based working environment . Furthermore , knowledge provides us an insight into the creative opinions and actions necessary to enhance innovation and productivity , and beneﬁts organizations by providing them with smarter and more competitive capability ( Galunic and Rodan , 1998 ) . The goal of knowledge management According to Nonaka and Takeuchi ( 1995 ) , knowledge management is aimed at inducing the tacit knowledge through knowledge spirals and so establish the organization knowledge properties , providing members with applicable organization resources . Furthermore , this knowledge can be embodied into their own tacit knowledge . Aside from enhancing the quality of the decision - making process it can also renew and enrich the organization knowledge properties . Papows ( 1999 ) contends that knowledge management is mainly aimed at triggering the creation , sharing and repeated use of knowledge so as to achieve the organization learning goal and extend the life of the organization . Arthur Andersen Business Consulting ( 1999 ) suggested that knowledge management should have the following goals : B improve the economic methods and methodologies meeting demands for innovation as well as enhanced efﬁciency in the operation ; B create products featuring innovative qualities by using creativity and which also improve the market adaptability ; B be aware of knowledge that can reduce costs ; B enhance the sharing of the organization knowledge in order to improve the problem solving capability within the company ; and B increase the efﬁciency by improving the competitiveness . Organizational innovation In today’s era of economic knowledge , strategies must be focused on expanding existent markets or creating new markets ( Kim and Mauborgne , 1998 ) . The past ways of business management cannot assure that they can provide ﬁrms with competitive advantages ( Lei et al . , 1999 ) . Continual innovation is the only way for ﬁrms to obtain a winning position in the competition ( Hoffman , 1999 ) . Schepers et al . ( 1999 ) contends that continuous growth is the main successful factor for almost all ﬁrms . Innovation is the principal factor to trigger business growth . Only if ﬁrms can VOL . 12 NO . 1 2008 j JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT j PAGE 5 continually create new products , systems , and service items to make every department meet the demands of the customer will they be able to obtain long term success . According to the research of Higgins ( 1995 ) , the largest property of twenty - ﬁrst - century ﬁrms lies in their capability for innovation . Innovation will deﬁnitely bring individuals , teams , organizations , industries or societies better values and may provide a ﬁrm a relative low cost production process , namely in good control of the tips with competitive advantages . Guinet and Pilat ( 1999 ) suggest that the reason large ﬁrms have been able to survive without any innovation in response to changes in their economic environment is only because of their successful product lines . However , in the current global competitive business climate , despite the business scale , no innovation means a very slim chance of survival . Thus , every department in every ﬁrm must keep up their innovation activities in order to sustain business growth and taking the lead in the marketplace . The correlation between knowledge accumulation and organizational innovation In today’s age of information explosion , the knowledge activities of a ﬁrm is being viewed as a type of intellectual property . By establishing excellent knowledge management systems , it is possible for a ﬁrm to make good effective use of its own resource so that they can accumulate business management experience and reach their goals for organizational innovation . In their research of organizational innovation , Liu et al . ( 2001 ) suggest that under today’s new competition environment , ﬁrms in the future will have to resort to continual innovation if they wish to obtain a competitive advantage . How to effectively absorb external knowledge and how to integrate their own knowledge and creativity and create new techniques , new products and new management ways are the critical issue for existing ﬁrms in pursuit of organizational innovation ( Chen , 2002 ) . In addition , Johannessen et al . ( 1999 ) also propose the innovation theory model and contend that the vision and knowledge creation of ﬁrms can play a supportive role in organizational innovation . Also , through the integration and application of knowledge , they can trigger innovation activities in an organization . From the above the authors are aware of the effect and the importance of knowledge management regarding innovation . Hence , the following hypothesis is suggested : H1 . The capability of knowledge accumulation can affect the innovation of an organization . Moderating effects of external environment to the effects of knowledge accumulation capability on organizational innovation The knowledge accumulation capability of organizations is affected by the external environment , causing variances to occur to the organizational innovation activities . The goal of knowledge management is to create , share and repeat the use of knowledge so as to reach an organization’s learning goals and extend the life of the organization ( Papows , 1999 ) . In order for organizations to be able to properly respond to their external environment , it is necessary that they have an appropriate method of selecting , obtaining , expanding and storing knowledge . They also must adopt a good method of knowledge accumulation activities so as to be able to demonstrate their good performance and technique of administrative innovation . ‘‘ Every department in every ﬁrm must keep up their innovation activities in order to sustain business growth and take the lead in the marketplace . ’’ PAGE 6 j JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT j VOL . 12 NO . 1 2008 Utterback ( 1971 ) indicated that the more volatile the market is , the quicker ﬁrms will adopt new technologies to establish a competitive advantage . Kimberly and Evanisko ( 1981 ) also contend that whenever the competition becomes more volatile , or if the size of the competition they face increases , ﬁrms tend to have a higher inclination to select new or innovative techniques . Levin et al . ( 1987 ) suggest that the degree of competition in industry is positively correlated to organizational innovation . Lai et al . ( 1997 ) suggest that the capability of organizational innovation can be viewed as a type of knowledge accumulation . No matter they use external knowledge absorption or internal knowledge enhancement in an organization , both methods remain available for ﬁrms to help improve their innovation capability and reach their goals of affecting or adapting to their environment . Hence , the following hypothesis is suggested : H2 . The external environment can affect the correlation between organization knowledge accumulation and organizational innovation . Moderating effects of organizational culture to the effects of knowledge accumulation capability on organizational innovation Numerous researches indicate that an innovation oriented organizational culture results in organizational innovation with positive efﬁciency . Liu ( 1998 ) emphasizes that the innovation - oriented organizational culture can result in enhanced organizational innovation . Cheng ( 2002 ) proposes that aside from the fact that organizations can reach their organizational innovation goals through organizational culture , it can also enhance the creation of organizational innovation by sharing the employees’ knowledge within the organization . The variation in organizational culture among organizations will also affect the adoption of knowledge management systems . Because organizational culture is an imperative element of knowledge management and if the culture creates mutual credit and cooperation , it can actually trigger the implementation of knowledge management ( Knapp , 1998 ) . In order to obtain an effective operation among the mechanisms of the organization knowledge management , it is not only necessary to emphasize the adaptability between organizational culture and the mechanisms of knowledge management , but also to shape a culture favorable for organizations to implement knowledge management , so that the real functional effect of knowledge management can be fully obtained ( Bhatt , 2000 ) . Thus , the variances among organizational cultures will deﬁnitely affect the correlation organization knowledge accumulation and organizational innovation . H3 . The organizational culture of organizations will affect the correlation between organization knowledge accumulation and organizational innovation . Research design Research framework Based on the above research motives and relevant references in the literature , the research framework of this research , as shown in Figure 1 , is an attempt to investigate the effect of separate knowledge accumulation capability , external environment and organizational culture on organizational innovation . The deﬁnition and measurement for variables of each dimension In this research , there are four major variables . For the measurement of variables in this research the authors propose the dimensions for measurement items and categorization items according to the literature . Following that , by using factor analysis and reliability analysis , this research will examine the reliability of the categorization . VOL . 12 NO . 1 2008 j JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT j PAGE 7 External environment By referring to the deﬁnition for environment by Gomez - Mejia et al . ( 1995 ) , the authors also quote the measurement scales proposed by Chang ( 2001 ) and mainly measure the variables such as environment uncertainty ( how correct is the information available to the ﬁrms for appropriate decision making ) , environment change frequency ( the frequency of change in the environment ) , environment complexity ( how many factors in the environment will affect individuals ) , and environment change scale ( the degree of change in the environment ) , for a total of four variables . Organizational culture The authors adopt the culture measuring scales for organizational culture proposed by Wallach ( 1983 ) to make variable measurement such as supportive type culture ( organizations featuring a more open , harmonious and family - like style with high level of support , equity , encouragement , openness , and trust while emphasizing member involvement , team spirits and personal relationship ) , innovative type culture ( organizations featuring a more complex style , with volatile and dynamic changes with tasks of creativity and risks . Under this environment , organizations looking for entrepreneurship will obtain success more easily . This type of organization ordinarily emphasizes the challenge of innovation faced by their members and allows for an adventure culture among their members ) , and a bureaucratic type culture ( Organizations with clearly speciﬁed responsibilities and tasks in a highly standardized and stable operation . This type of organization is frequently established on the foundation of control and power . This type of organization conducts stable , mature and prudent business management activities ) , for a total of three items . The capability of knowledge accumulation By referring to the frequently measured dimension items of knowledge management as proposed by Tarn and Wang ( 2001 ) and other relevant studies in the literature , the measured variables include : B knowledge selection ( saving search time and cost for the efﬁcient and effective selection of knowledge resources required by the organization ) ; B knowledge obtainment ( it can make an organization effectively obtain the interface management tasks of external knowledge ) ; Figure 1 Research framework PAGE 8 j JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT j VOL . 12 NO . 1 2008 B knowledge expansion ( it means that the department can efﬁciently and effectively expand their transmission to other departments to share their knowledge ) ; B knowledge establishment ( this means that knowledge is converted into other types of management activities for the convenience of transmitting knowledge to others ) ; and B knowledge storage ( it means that past transmitted knowledge within an organization is converted into the long term and short term memory to save both time and cost for other members in the organization in need of this knowledge ) , totally ﬁve items . Organizational innovation The authors adopt the opinion proposed by Daft ( 1978 ) and Damanpour ( 1991 ) , in which the organizational innovation is viewed as two dimensions of administrative innovation and management technique . Our measuring scales are adopted from Tsai ( 1997 ) and include administrative innovation ( this refers to the innovation on projecting , organizing , stafﬁng , leading , controlling and serving ) and technical innovation ( this means the innovation on product , production procedures and equipment ) , a total of two types . Data collection In this research , the authors took a sample from the top 5 , 000 ﬁrms of 2004 proposed by China Credit Information Service . This research randomly selected 1 , 000 ﬁrms and made a telephone call beforehand to inquire if they would be willing to participate in our questionnaire . A total of 1 , 000 questionnaires were delivered . Our research questionnaire was ﬁlled out by the ﬁrm’s manager or the business owner . A total of 137 questionnaires were returned . Among them , there were eight questionnaires that were considered invalid due to incomplete answers , leaving a total of 129 valid questionnaires , or a 12 . 9 percent rate of return . Within the sampling structure , high technology accounts for 15 . 50 percent , the service industries accounts for 27 . 1 percent , and manufacturing industries make up the remainder at 57 . 36 percent . The percentage of ﬁrms with a history above 20 years is 57 . 36 percent . Most ﬁrm capital is rated at 2 - 5 billion NTD and 5 billion NTD , both equally at 24 . 03 percent . The ﬁrms staffed with 500 - 1000 employees occupy the largest proportion at 25 . 58 percent . Reliability and validity analysis Every operation deﬁnition and measurement within this research is based on past opinions and scientiﬁc practices , and the measuring scales are taken from the relevant literature . The questionnaire was executed using real life interview and pre - test of 15 ﬁrms . Thus , the data within this research has content reliability to a certain degree . To explain the dimensions for factor analysis , this research adopted the principal factor analysis and abstracted the factors with eigenvalues more than 1 . Following that , this research further adopted the Varimax axial rotation with factor loading above 0 . 5 after rotation . Also , the difference of these factors and other factor loading values had to exceed 0 . 3 . Finally , the authors referred to the text meaning and loading values of the constituent factors and provided separate names . In this research , the factor loading values of every question item exceeded 0 . 7 , and every question is vested with a factor . Thus , the questionnaire for this research is considered reliable . The Cronbach’s coefﬁcient alpha of each variable in this research exceeds 0 . 75 . Also , the accumulating explanatory variance of the dimensions established by various variables exceeds 75 percent . Thus , the experimental data collected for our research may be considered to be reliable ( Table I ) . Research result Inter - relationship between knowledge accumulation capability and organizational innovation The results of the canonical correlation analysis of the effect of knowledge accumulation capability on organizational innovation , indicate that knowledge storage and obtaining VOL . 12 NO . 1 2008 j JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT j PAGE 9 knowledge positively affect organizational innovation . ( R 2 ¼ 0 : 294 , p , 0 : 05 , RI ¼ 21 . 61 percent ) ( Tables II and III ) . In other words , the better the capability of knowledge storage and knowledge obtainment , the better the performance in administrative innovation and technical innovation will be . The multiple regression results for the effect of knowledge accumulation capability on organizational innovation , indicate that knowledge obtainment and knowledge expansion signiﬁcantly affect administrative innovation . ( R 2 ¼ 0 : 235 , p ¼ 0 : 000 , F ¼ 7 : 553 ) As to technical innovation , only knowledge obtainment signiﬁcantly affects technical innovation ( R 2 ¼ 0 : 227 , p ¼ 0 : 000 , F ¼ 7 : 209 ) ( Table IV ) . According to the knowledge management equation K ¼ ð P þ I Þ S as proposed by Arthur Andersen ( 1999 ) , the authors ﬁnd that the higher the order of S , the higher the degree of knowledge share . In other words , the higher the degree of knowledge share the more knowledge it can yield . It also means it results in a more efﬁcient knowledge management .

Leonard - Barton ( 1995 ) suggested that the various methods for an organization to obtain external knowledge are actually related to whether the obtained technique knowledge has potential beneﬁt or whether that knowledge is available to ﬁrms to enhance their competitiveness . The channels and methods for obtaining technique are helpful for employees to engage in technical innovation and they lower the time required for products to be put on the market ( Lee and Hsieh , 1999 ) . Thus , it is evident that the capability of knowledge obtainment will affect the enhancement of technical innovation to a certain degree . Effects of knowledge accumulation capability and external environment on organizational innovation In this section , the authors adopt two research dimensions . The ﬁrst one , knowledge accumulation capability , is divided into ﬁve factors ( knowledge selection , knowledge obtainment , knowledge expansion , knowledge establishment and knowledge storage ) . The second research dimension , the External Environment dimension , is divided into four factors ( environment complexity , environment uncertainty , environment change and the scales of environment change ) as shown in Table V . Table VI shows the ANOVA analysis for pairing groups between organization accumulation and environment complexity . Table VI shows that both administrative innovation and technical innovation reach their signiﬁcant levels and it is evident that the environment complexity actually affects the correlation between knowledge complexity and organizational innovation . For administrative innovation , from these four groups , the group with high knowledge accumulation and high environment complexity and the group with low knowledge accumulation and high environment complexity have higher average values , of 3 . 4765 and 3 . 2765 respectively . The group with low knowledge accumulation and low environment complexity has the second highest average at 3 . 2688 , and the group average of high knowledge and low environment complexity is 3 . 0483 . For technical innovation , the group average values are 3 . 7279 for the group of high knowledge accumulation and high environment complexity , 3 . 5078 for the group of high knowledge accumulation and low environment complexity , 3 . 3971 for the group of low knowledge accumulation and high environment complexity and 3 . 2414 for the group of low knowledge accumulation and low environment complexity , respectively , and in descending order . Table VII shows the ANOVA analysis of the divided groups of knowledge accumulation and environment uncertainty .

For technical innovation , the group averages are respectively 3 . 7560 for the group with high knowledge accumulation and high environment change scales , 3 . 3854 for the group with high knowledge accumulation and low environment change scales , 3 . 3580 for the group with low knowledge accumulation and high environment change scales and 3 . 2500 for the group with low knowledge accumulation and low environment change scales . The results of the above analysis indicate that the ﬁrms with a capability of high knowledge accumulation , regardless if the external environment is volatile or not , can make good use of the advantages of having excellent capability for knowledge accumulation and consequently they can achieve administrative innovation and technical innovation . When the capability of knowledge accumulation is lower , the ﬁrms with a high external environment change ( complexity , uncertainty , change frequency and change scales ) have a better performance on administrative innovation and technical innovation than that the ﬁrms with a lower environment change . This indicates that the correlation for the effect of external environment on knowledge accumulation and organizational innovation as stated in H2 is proven in this research . Effects of knowledge accumulation capability and organizational culture on organizational innovation In this section , the authors adopt two research dimensions . The ﬁrst one , knowledge accumulation , is divided by ﬁve dimension factors and the second research dimension , organizational culture , which is divided by three dimension factors ( bureaucratic culture , innovative culture , and supportive culture ) for pairing comparison , with the results shown in Table X . Table XI shows the results for the ANOVA analysis for the groups for pairing between knowledge accumulation and bureaucratic culture . Table XI indicates that both administrative innovation and technical innovation reach signiﬁcant levels . This indicates that bureaucratic culture actually affects the correlation between knowledge accumulation and organizational innovation . For administrative innovation , the group average of the group with high knowledge accumulation and high bureaucratic culture and the other group of high knowledge accumulation and low bureaucratic culture are 3 . 4054 and 3 . 3379 , respectively . This is followed by the group averages of 3 . 2791 for the group of low knowledge accumulation and high bureaucratic culture and 2 . 9400 for the group of low knowledge accumulation and low bureaucratic culture , respectively .

This indicates the effect of innovative culture on the correlation between knowledge accumulation and organizational innovation . For administrative innovation , the group averages of the group with high knowledge accumulation and high innovative culture , and the group with low knowledge accumulation and high innovative culture are 3 . 6483 and 3 . 5895 respectively . This is followed by the group averages of 3 . 1622 for the group with high knowledge accumulation and low innovative culture and 2 . 9909 for the group with low knowledge accumulation and low innovative culture , respectively . For technical innovation , the group averages are respectively 3 . 8879 for the group with high knowledge accumulation and high innovative culture , 3 . 7368 for the group with low knowledge accumulation and high innovative culture , 3 . 4122 for the group with high knowledge accumulation and low innovative culture and 3 . 1477 for the group with low knowledge accumulation and low innovative culture . Table XIII indicates the results of the ANOVA analysis for the groups for pairing between knowledge accumulation and supportive culture . Table XIII shows that both administrative innovation and technical innovation reach signiﬁcant levels . This indicates the effect of supportive culture on the correlation between knowledge accumulation and organizational innovation . For administrative innovation , the group with high knowledge accumulation and high supportive culture , and the other group with low knowledge accumulation and high supportive culture have higher averages of 3 . 5476 and 3 . 2919 , respectively . Following that , the group averages are respectively 3 . 0750 for the group with low knowledge accumulation and low supportive culture and 3 . 0000 for the group with low knowledge accumulation and low supportive culture . For technical innovation , the group averages are respectively 3 . 6786 for the group with high knowledge accumulation and high supportive culture , 3 . 5208 for the group with high knowledge accumulation and low supportive culture , 3 . 4122 for the group with low knowledge accumulation and high supportive culture and 3 . 2019 for the group with low knowledge accumulation and low supportive culture . The above analysis results indicate that most ﬁrms with the capability of high knowledge accumulation fall into the types of different high culture and low culture styles with better performance on both administrative innovation and technical innovation . If the ﬁrms with the capability of low knowledge accumulation have the inclination to higher culture styles ( Bureaucratic Culture , Innovative Culture , and Supportive Culture ) , then they will also have a better performance on administrative innovation and technical innovation than those with low culture styles . Based on the foregoing , it may be concluded that H3 in this research is well established .

This situation corresponds to that of Hendrinks and Vriens ( 1999 ) who emphasized that knowledge can create the values exceeding the current levels and also yield innovative or new operating modes . Wu ( 2001 ) also contends that if knowledge type ﬁrms can create an effective knowledge system , it will allow for the effective creation and circulation of knowledge within these organizations and make effective and continuously innovative products possible . The inhibition effect of the external environment and organizational culture against the effect of the knowledge accumulation capability on organizational innovation The effect of the external environment on the correlation between knowledge accumulation and organizational innovation , external environment and organization knowledge accumulation will result in a mutual interaction to inﬂuence the organizational innovation . If an organization has a high capability of knowledge accumulation , regardless of the changes in external environment people have to face , then they can take better advantage of the knowledge they already possess in response to any changes in the external environment , and they will demonstrate a better performance in both administrative innovation and technical innovation . When ﬁrms with a low capability of knowledge accumulation are facing a high impact environment it may trigger extra efforts by administrative innovation and technical innovation in order to achieve a better performance . The effect of organizational culture on the correlation of the knowledge of accumulation and organizational innovation , organizational culture and organization knowledge accumulation will result in a mutual interaction to inﬂuence organizational innovation . If organizations have a high capability of knowledge accumulation , no matter the organizational cultures are high or low culture types , they can demonstrate better performance on both administrative and technical innovation . Among ﬁrms with a low capability of knowledge accumulation , no matter which organizational culture type they belong to , those ﬁrms that show a higher inclination of organizational cultures will demonstrate better performance on both administrative innovation and technical innovation . Research limitations There are many factors inﬂuence organizational innovation . Within this research , the authors only discussed some organizational layers like knowledge accumulation , external environment and organizational culture without any further research efforts aimed at any other facets . Culture is one of the key factors that determine human behavior . From this research , the authors ﬁnd the inﬂuence on knowledge management and organization innovation caused by organizational culture . All nations come with their own culture backgrounds which are different from others . The samples for this research are only adopted from local industries in Taiwan ( high - tech industries , service industries and manufacturing industries ) . Further examination is required about the generalizability of the ﬁndings . ‘‘ In today’s age of information explosion , the knowledge activities of a ﬁrm are viewed as a type of intellectual property . ’’ VOL . 12 NO . 1 2008 j JOURNAL OF KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT j PAGE 17 References Arthur Andersen Business Consulting ( 1999 ) , Zukai Knowledge Management , Toyo Keizai Inc . , Tokyo .
