Sternberg Yale University A prestudy and four experiments were conducted in order to understand the nature and use of people ' s implicit theories of intelligence , creativity , and wisdom . In the prestudy , a brief questionnaire was sent out to professors in each of the fields of art , business , philosophy , and physics , and was also given to laypersons . The ques - tionnaire asked subjects to list behaviors characteristic of an ideally intelligent , creative , or wise person in one ' s field of endeavor , or in general , for laypersons . In Experiment 1 , individuals from the same populations rated , on a 9 - point scale , the extent to which each of the behaviors listed at least twice in the Prestudy was char - acteristic of an ideally intelligent , creative , or wise individual . In Experiment 2 , a subset of the behaviors from the prestudy was sorted by subjects in order to yield a multidimensional space characterizing the subjects ' implicit theories for each of intelligence , creativity , and wisdom . In Experiment 3 , subjects rated themselves on a subset of the behaviors from the prestudy , and these ratings were correlated with " ideal prototype " ratings to yield a measure of resemblance to the prototype . Re - semblance scores were then correlated with scores on standardized ability tests . In Experiment 4 , subjects rated hypothetical individuals described in simulated letters of recommendation in terms of their intelligence , creativity , and wisdom . The results revealed that people have systematic implicit theories of intelligence , creativity , and wisdom , and that they use these implicit theories accurately both in evaluating themselves and in evaluating hypothetical others . Moreover , the implicit theories for each of the constructs show at least some convergent - discriminant validity with respect to each other . That Solomon was wise , or Picasso , creative , no one doubts . Perhaps it would be unwise to do so , no matter how creative the reasons for doubt might be . But if one were to ask just what psychological attributes made Solomon wise , or Picasso , creative , most psychologists would either shrug their shoulders , or throw up their hands in despair . In any event , Solo - monic pronouncements probably would not be forthcoming . Theories of psychological constructs such as wisdom , creativity , and intelligence can be Preparation of this article was supported in part by Contract NOOOI478C0025 from the Office of Naval Re - search and Contract N0001483K0013 from the Office of Naval Research and the Army Research Institute to Robert } .

Explicit theories are constructions of psy - chologists or other scientists that are based on or at least tested on data collected from people performing tasks presumed to measure psy - chological functioning . Although investigators working with explicit theories of psychological constructs might disagree as to the nature of the constructs , using , for example , factors , components , schemata , or some other kind of psychological construct , they would agree that the data base from which the proposed con - structs should be isolated should consist ( di - rectly or indirectly ) of performance on tasks requiring intelligent functioning . Explicit theories have dominated the liter - ature on intelligence . For example , psycho - metric theories such as Spearman ' s ( 1927 ) two - factor theory or Guilford ' s ( 1967 , 1982 ) struc - ture - of - intellect model ; cognitive theories such 607 608 ROBERT J . STERNBERG as Sternberg ' s ( 1981 , 1983 ) componential the - ory or Hunt ' s ( 1980 ) distributed - memory the - ory ; and genetic - epistemological theories such as Piaget ' s ( 1972 ) theory of equilibration , are all explicit theories of intelligence . Explicit theories have also played the major role in conceptualizing creativity . These theories , too , have been of different kinds . Guilford ' s ( 1950 ) theory is psychometric , Getzels ' s ( 1975 ) theory is cognitive ( see also Getzels & Csikszentmi - halyi , 1976 ) , Barren ' s ( 1965 , 1968 ) theory is clinical , and Amabile ' s ( 1983 ) theory is social - psychological . The theories have in common , however , their drawing on data based on the exercise of what the theorists allege is creative psychological process . The literature on wis - dom is much sparser , and much of it is outside the psychological tradition ( see review of lit - erature in Clayton & Birren , 1980 ) . There are scattered psychological attempts to deal with wisdom within an explicit - theoretical frame - work ( e . g . , Erikson , 1959 ) , but such attempts appear to be rare . Even a cursory review of the literature will reveal a monotonic decreasing trend in the amount of explicit - psychological theorizing regarding intelligence , creativity , and wisdom , respectively . There might be any number of reasons for this trend , but one of these reasons is almost certainly the ability of psychologists to generate either a conceptual or an opera - tional definition of the construct under inves - tigation . There have existed , for many years , and continue to exist to this day , serious dif - ferences among psychologists in their views on the nature of intelligence ( see " Intelligence and its Measurement , " 1921 ; Sternberg , 1982 ) , but these differences seem to be systematic ( Stern - berg , 1985 ) . Moreover , despite these differ - ences , the psychometric intelligence test has received a great deal of acceptance , if grudging , as an operational definition of intelligence , al - beit a highly limited one . The disagreements over what an intelligence test should test are minor compared with those over what a creativity test should test ( Amabile , 1982 ) . Whereas most investigators of intelli - gence would agree that intelligence tests mea - sure at least some limited aspect of intellectual functioning ( Cronbach , 1984 ) , many investi - gators of creativity would question whether creativity tests such as those of Torrance ( 1966 ) and Guilford ( 1967 ) measure anything even coming close to creativity ( Amabile , 1982 ; Gruber , in press ; Sternberg & Davidson , in press ) . In the domain of wisdom , there do not even exist any tests with sufficient acceptance to generate disagreement . When fields of psychological endeavor , such as those of intelligence and especially of cre - ativity and wisdom , are at a loss for even def - initions of constructs on which to base explicit theories , implicit theories can be useful for providing a conceptual framework for the de - velopment of explicit theories . Implicit theories are constructions by people ( whether psychologists or laypersons ) that re - side in the minds of these individuals . Such theories need to be discovered rather than in - vented because they already exist , in some form , in people ' s heads . Discovering such the - ories can be useful in helping to formulate the common - cultural views that dominate think - ing about a given psychological construct , whether the culture be one of people , in gen - eral , or of psychologists , in particular . Under - standing implicit theories can also help us un - derstand or provide bases for explicit theories , because explicit theories derive , in part , from scientists ' implicit theories of the construct under investigation . The data of interest in the discovery of people ' s implicit theories are peo - ple ' s communications , in whatever form , re - garding their notions as to the nature of the psychological construct under investigation . Intelligence , creativity , and wisdom have all been subject to at least some study through the vehicle of understanding people ' s implicit the - ories . Consider each of these constructs in turn . By far , the largest number of studies of im - plicit theories has been done for intelligence . Perhaps the most direct way of discovering such theories is simply to ask people what they are . For example , the editors of the Journal of Educational Psychology asked experts in the field of intelligence their views of intelligence ( " Intelligence and its Measurement , " 1921 ) , and received 14 responses , such as " the ability to carry on abstract thinking " ( Terman ) and " ability to adapt oneself adequately to rela - tively new situations in life " ( Pintner ) . Stern - berg , Conway , Ketron , and Bernstein ( 1981 ) did a rather more elaborate study involving both experts and laypersons . Lists of intelligent and unintelligent behaviors were collected , and then these behaviors were rated for their char - INTELLIGENCE , CREATIVITY , AND WISDOM 609 acteristicness in an ideally intelligent person , and for their importance in denning the con - cept of intelligence . The results of experts and laypersons were surprisingly similar . Factor analyses of their ratings revealed three basic factors for the laypersons ( and similar factors for the experts ) : Practical Problem - Solving Ability ( e . g . , reasons logically and well , iden - tifies connections among ideas , sees all aspects of a problem ) ; Verbal Ability ( e . g . , speaks clearly and articulately , is verbally fluent , con - verses well ) ; and Social Competence ( e . g . , ac - cepts others for what they are , admits mistakes , displays interest in the world at large ) . Subjects not only used these three factors to form ab - stract characterizations , but also appeared to use them to rate their own intelligence , as well as to evaluate the intelligence of others . Related studies have been carried out by Siegler and Richards ( 1982 ) , Yussen and Kane ( 1985 ) , Cornelius ( 1984 ) , and Berg and Sternberg ( in press ) , looking at developmental aspects of the nature of intelligence over the life span . The consensus obtained in all these studies gives credence to Neisser ' s ( 1979 ) view that the concept , intelligent person , is a prototypically organized concept according to which a person is viewed as intelligent to the extent he or she resembles some implicit prototype of what people imagine an intelligent person to be . Al - though a consensus seems to exist for the con - cept of intelligence , it is important to point out that this consensus is culturally limited and that quite different prototypes for intelligence exist in other cultures ( Wober , 1974 ) . The implicit - theories approach has also been applied to the study of creativity . For ex - ample , MacKinnon ( 1964 ) had architects of three levels of estimated creativity rate both themselves and an ideal self on the Gough ( 1961 ) Adjective Check List . The results sug - gested those attributes most characteristic of highly creative and less creative individuals . Adjectives that best distinguished the top from bottom groups of architects ( high scores for more creative architects ) were : inventive , de - termined , independent , individualistic , enthu - siastic , industrious , artistic , progressive , and appreciative . Adjectives that best distinguished the bottom from the top group ( higher scores for less creative architects ) were : responsible , sincere , reliable , dependable , clear - thinking , tolerant , understanding , peaceable , good - na - tured , moderate , steady , practical , logical . Barren ( 1968 ) used a Q - sort technique to dis - tinguish attributes of creative writers , and ob - tained five items that were particularly dis - tinctive of the highly creative writers : appears to have a high degree of intellectual capacity , genuinely values intellectual and cognitive matters , values own independence and auton - omy , is verbally fluent â€” can express ideas well , enjoys aesthetic impressions â€” is aesthetically reactive . Similar studies have been done for creative mathematicians by Helson ( 1980 ) . Very little systematic psychological work of any kind has been done on wisdom , with the notable exception of the work of Clayton ( 1982 ; Clayton & Birren , 1980 ) . Clayton mul - tidimensionally scaled words potentially re - lated to wisdom for three samples of adults differing in age ( younger , middle - aged , older ) . In her earliest study ( Clayton , 1975 ) , the terms that were scaled were : experienced , intuitive , introspective , pragmatic , understanding , gentle , empathetic , intelligent , peaceful , knowledge - able , sense of humor , observant . In a later study , she added three more terms : wise , aged , my - self . In each study , subjects were asked to rate similarities between all possible pairs of words . The main similarity in the results for the age cohorts for whom the scalings were done was the elicitation of two consistent dimensions of wisdom , which Clayton referred to as an " af - fective " dimension and a " reflective " dimen - sion . There was also a suggestion of a dimen - sion relating to age . The greatest difference among the age cohorts is that mental repre - sentations of wisdom seemed to become more differentiated with increases in the age of the subjects . Further developments of this line of work are currently being conducted by Ditt - mann - Kohli and Baltes ( in press ) . The present study seeks to understand ( a ) implicit theories of intelligence , creativity , and wisdom in different subpopulations , ( b ) how people use these implicit theories in making judgments of themselves and others , ( c ) how people ' s judgments of the resemblance be - tween themselves and a prototype relate to scores on psychometric tests , and ( d ) how peo - ple view these three constructs as interrelated . Four experiments were carried out for these purposes , each of which used a different meth - odology to help illuminate people ' s implicit theories . A prestudy involved professors of art , 610 ROBERT J . STERNBERG business , philosophy , and physics , and layper - sons , specifying behaviors characteristic of in - telligence , creativity , and wisdom . The first ex - periment involved analysis of ratings of the importance of various behaviors for denning intelligence , creativity , and wisdom , as per - ceived by professors in the four fields noted and by laypersons . The second experiment used multidimensional scaling to obtain per - ceived dimensions of intelligence , creativity , and wisdom as perceived by laypersons . The third experiment involved people rating them - selves on questionnaires assessing behaviors derived from laypersons ' implicit theories of intelligence , creativity , and wisdom , and then our correlating the people ' s prototype - resem - blance scores ( r ) on the questionnaires with scores on psychometric tests that might plau - sibly relate to the prototype - based scores de - rived from the self - ratings . The fourth exper - iment involved people ' s rating the intelligence , creativity , and wisdom of hypothetical people for whom " letters of recommendation " were provided , with the behaviors listed in the letters derived from the implicit theories . Subjects were never given prior definitions of intelli - gence , creativity , or wisdom in any of the ex - periments . Prestudy A brief questionnaire was filled out by 25 , 26 , 20 , and 26 professors in the fields of art , business , philosophy , and physics , respectively , at a variety of U . S . universities ( representing a return rate of 17 % on questionnaires sent out ) . The questionnaire was also given to 17 laypersons ( nonstudent adult residents of New Haven who answered a newspaper advertise - ment ) . The questionnaire asked respondents to spend a few minutes listing whatever be - haviors they could think of that were charac - teristic of an ideally intelligent , creative , or wise person in their respective fields of endeavor ( or , in the case of laypersons , in general ) . The response rate for the mailed questionnaires was 17 % , and was practically the same across fields . Those behaviors listed at least twice served as a basis for the subsequent investigations . The total numbers of behaviors obtained were 119 for art , 131 for business , 107 for philosophy , 138 for physics , and 156 for laypersons . Although the response rate for the profes - sionals was low , it appears to have been quite enough to generate large numbers of behaviors . Indeed , the perfect response rate for the lay - persons yielded only a small number of addi - tional unique behaviors over those generated by the professionals . The reason for this small difference is that the large majority of respon - ses obtained were redundant across subjects . Thus , the returns appear to have been adequate to generate a large pool of behaviors ( over 100 for each population ) to serve as bases for rat - ings in the subsequent experiments . Experiment 1 Method Two hundred professors in art , business , philosophy , and physics were asked to rate the characteristicness of each of the behaviors obtained in the prestudy from the cor - responding population with respect to their ideal conception of each of an ideally intelligent , creative , or wise individual in their occupation . The wording was that of the prestudy subjects , with slight editing to provide some uniformity of style . Laypersons ( nonstudent adult residents of New Haven ) also provided these ratings , but for a hypothetical ideal individual without regard to occupation . Ratings were on a 1 ( low ) to 9 ( high ) scale , with a rating of 1 meaning " behavior extremely uncharacteristic " and a rating of 9 meaning " behavior extremely characteristic . " There were 65 respondents for the art questionnaire , 70 respondents for the business questionnaire , 65 respondents for the phi - losophy questionnaire , 85 respondents for the physics questionnaire , and 30 subjects for the laypersons ' ques - tionnaire . These numbers of respondents represented re - turn rates of 32 . 5 % for art , 35 % for business , 32 . 5 % for philosophy , and 42 . 5 % for physics . These return rates are quite respectable for a mailed questionnaire . Apparently , the use of a structured questionnaire generated more re - spondents than the use of the unstructured questionnaire in the Prestudy . The return rates are comparable across professions , but the fact that they are all well less than 100 % does raise the possibility that there may have been some unknown sampling bias as a function of who chose to return the questionnaire . Each participant provided all three ratings ( of intelli - gence , creativity , and wisdom ) . However , order of ratings was counterbalanced in a Latin square arrangement in questionnaires sent out , so that the ratings of each attribute occurred approximately equally often in the first , second , and third positions . Results Table 1 presents the basic statistics for the ratings . Means are for individual items , aver - aged over subjects within each population . As can be seen , ratings were approximately equal in mean values across occupations , with no means differing significantly across groups .

Table 2 presents the intercorrelations be - tween the three ratings for each of the separate groups for the master list of behaviors for each occupation . Correlations are for parrs of ratings of attributes for each set of behavioral items , averaged over subjects . Thus , the number of observations contributing to each correlation is equal to the number of behavioral items ( not the number of subjects ' ) . Because each group received a different set of behaviors , based on the sets of behaviors generated in the Prestudy , correlations could not be computed across groups . In all cases except for the philosophers , intelligence is seen as more highly related to wisdom than either of intelligence or wisdom are seen as related to creativity . All correlations are significantly positive , except for the cor - relation between creativity and wisdom for the business professors , which was significantly negative ! In all cases , the relation between cre - ativity and wisdom is the weakest one of the three . Thus , intelligence and wisdom are per - ceived as more similar to each other than either is perceived as similar to creativity . Discussion Several aspects of the results are worthy of note . First , the behavioral listing procedure of the Prestudy seems to have worked about equally well for each group : There is relatively little range among the mean ratings of behav - iors for intelligence , creativity , and wisdom , respectively , across occupational groups . The fact that all 15 means are above 5â€”the middle of the 9 - point scaleâ€”indicates that for the most part , the behaviors that were listed were ones that were quite characteristic of intelli - gent , creative , or wise individuals in each of the groups . Second , the ratings are highly reliable across both subjects and items : The range of subject reliabilities was from . 81 to . 96 with a median of . 92 ; the range of item reliabilities was from . 88 to . 97 with a median of . 92 . The high de - gree of internal consistency across subjects ( subject reliability ) indicates that there is con - siderable agreement within each population as to what constitutes behaviors that are more or less characteristic of a particular attribute ( in - telligence , creativity , or wisdom ) . The high de - gree of internal consistency across items ( item reliability ) indicates that the set of items within 612 ROBERT J . STERNBERG each attribute constitutes a coherent set of be - haviors , rather than a grab - bag of unrelated behaviors . Thus , at least within population , intelligence , creativity , and wisdom constitute fairly tightly organized prototypes . Third , it is clear that without regard to pop - ulation , intelligence and wisdom are believed to be most similar to each other and creativity and wisdom least similar to each other , among the three possible pairs of attributes . These implicit theories are clearly inconsistent with views such as Guilford ' s ( 1967 ) , according to which creativity is an aspect of intelligence . Rather , they are consistent with views synthe - sized by Cronbach ( 1984 ) , according to which at least in the higher ranges of ability , intelli - gence and creativity are distinct entities . The design of this experiment does not allow direct comparisons of implicit theories among occupational groups . There are both theoret - ical and practical reasons for such a design in studies of this kind . At a theoretical level , it is important to rec - ognize the domain - specificity of abilities , and especially creative abilities , in various domains of adult endeavor ( Chi , Glaser , & Rees , 1982 ; Cronbach , 1984 ; Keil , 1984 ; Larkin , Mc - Dermott , J . Simon , & D . P . Simon , 1980 ) . Performance in various occupational groups , like performance in various cultural groups , requires emic rather than etic measurementâ€” that is , measurement that is appropriate for the group in which it is being conducted . As in cross - cultural studies , presenting each group with the same items often does not make sense . For example , art professors would probably find it meaningless to rate a behavior such as " comes up with novel business services or products " for its relevance to creativity in art ; similarly , business professors would probably find it meaningless to rate a behavior such as " recognizes the aspects of physical phenomena that are the underlying concepts of physics " for creativity in business . To be interpretable , characteristicness ratings require relevance of the behavior to the domain under considera - tion . With behaviors such as those noted here , characteristicness ratings would not make sense , because the behaviors are simply irrel - evant to the given field of endeavor .

Using alternate forms so that professors would have had to rate only half the behaviors would have still required 2 hrs , and an extremely large number of subjects . Thus , it seemed practically as well as theoretically preferable to employ emic ( within - occupation ) rather than etic ( between - occupation ) questionnaires . Experiment 2 Method In this experiment , 40 Yale College students were asked to sort three sets of 40 behaviors into as many or as few piles as they wished on the basis of which behaviors are " likely to be found together " in a person . These behaviors were from the listings for intelligence , creativity , and wis - dom , respectively , from Experiment 1 . Only the top 40 behaviors ( in terms of laypersons ' characteristicness ratings from Experiment I ) were used in each sorting task . Order of sortings for behaviors from the intelligence , creativity , and wisdom lists was counterbalanced in a Latin square arrangement . Subjects were not told in advance what the behaviors had in common ( i . e . , considered characteristic of intelligence , creativity , or wisdom ) . Results Results of the scalings of intelligence , cre - ativity , and wisdom are shown in Tables 3 - 5 , respectively . All scalings were nonmetric and done with ALSCAL using Stress Formula 1 and the primary method of resolving ties . All scal - ings are principal - axis solutions . Hence , each dimension accounted for the maximum pos - sible variance , controlling for earlier dimen - sions , if any . Dimensions are extracted in order of strength ( variance accounted for in the data ) . Table 3 shows the multidimensional scaling for intelligence . Three dimensions accounted for 82 % of the variance in the data , with a Stress of . 15 . Because the scaling was a prin - cipal - axis solution , it tended to yield bipolar dimensions in which the positive and negative polarities lent themselves to separate but re - lated interpretations . The first dimension yielded two interpre - tations : practical problem - solving ability for the positive polarity ( e . g . , tends to see attainable goals and accomplish them ; has ability to change directions and use another procedure ; is able to apply knowledge to particular prob - lems ) and verbal ability for the negative po - larity ( e . g . , can converse on almost any topic ; has demonstrated a good vocabulary ; has a good command of language ) . The second dimension also lent itself to two interpretations . The positive polarity of this dimension was labeled intellectual balance and integration ( e . g . , has the ability to recognize similarities and differences ; listens to all sides of an issue ; is able to grasp abstract ideas and focus his or her attention on those ideas ) , and the negative polarity was labeled goal orien - tation and attainment ( e . g . , tends to obtain and use information for specific purposes ; possesses ability for high achievement ; is motivated by goals ) . The third dimension yielded two interpre - tations , contextual intelligence for the positive polarity ( e . g . , learns and remembers and gains information from past mistakes or successes ; has the ability to understand and interpret his or her environment ; knows what ' s going on in the world ) , and . fluid thought for the negative polarity ( e . g . , has a thorough grasp of mathe - matics , good spatial ability , or both ; has a high IQ level ; thinks quickly ) . Table 4 displays the results of the nonmetric multidimensional scalings for the sortings of the creativity behaviors . Four dimensions ac - counted for 93 % of the variance in the data with a stress of . 08 . The first dimension yielded two interpre - tations , nonenlrenchmenl for the positive po - larity ( e . g . , makes up rules as he or she goes along ; has a free spirit ; is unorthodox ) , and integration and intellectuality for the negative polarity ( e . g . , makes connections and distinc - tions between ideas and things ; has the ability to recognize similarities and differences ; is able to put old information , theories , and so forth together in a new way ) . The second dimension was also interpreted in terms of two polarities : Aesthetic taste and imagination for the positive polarity ( e . g . , has an appreciation of art , music , and so forth ; can write , draw , compose music ; has good taste ) and decisional skill and flexibility for the negative polarity ( e . g . , follows his or her gut feelings in making decisions after weighing the pros and cons ; has ability to change directions and use another procedure ) . The third dimension was interpreted in terms of perspicacity for its positive polarity 614 ROBERT J . STERNBERG ( e . g . , questions societal norms , truisms , as - sumptions ; is willing to take a stand ) and of drive for accomplishment and recognition for its negative polarity ( e . g . , is motivated by goals ; likes to be complimented on his or her work ; is energetic ) .

Three dimensions accounted for 87 % of the variance in the data , with a Stress of . 14 . The first dimension yielded two interpre - tations , reasoning ability for the positive po - larity ( e . g . , has the unique ability to look at a problem or situation and solve it ; has good problem solving ability ; has a logical mind ) and sagacity for the negative polarity ( e . g . , considers advice ; understands people through dealing with a variety of people ; feels he or she can always learn from other people ; is fair ) . The second dimension also yielded two in - terpretations , learning from ideas and envi - ronment for the positive polarity ( e . g . , attaches importance to ideas ; is perceptive ; learns from other people ' s mistakes ) and judgment for the negative polarity ( e . g . , acts within own physical and intellectual limitations ; is sensible ; has good judgment at all times ; thinks before act - ing or making decisions ) . Finally , the third dimension also yielded two interpretations , expeditious use of information for the positive polarity ( e . g . , is experienced ; seeks out information , especially details ; learns and remembers and gains information from past mistakes or successes ) and perspicacity for the negative polarity ( e . g . , can offer solutions that are on the side of right and truth ; is able to see through thingsâ€”read between the lines ; has the ability to understand and interpret his or her environment ) . Discussion Several aspects of these data are worthy of note . First , the fits of the multidimensional scaling model to the data , with proportions of variance accounted for equaling . 82 , . 93 , and . 87 for intelligence , creativity , and wisdom , re - spectively , are quite respectable , indicating that the scaling data were reliable and that the model extracted most of the variance from the proximity data with only small numbers of di - mensions . Thus , one can have a reasonably high degree of confidence that the dimensions obtained reflect something other than random fluctuations of the data . Second , the dimensions obtained for intel - ligence replicate , but also expand on , those obtained by Sternberg et al . ( 1981 ) using a dif - ferent methodology ( factor analysis of the characteristicness ratings ) , a different set of subjects , and a different ( but related ) set of be - haviors . The two polarities of the first dimen - sion replicate the first two factors for laypersons of Sternberg et al . ( Practical Problem - Solving Ability and Verbal Ability ) and the positive polarity of the second dimension is close to the Social Competence dimension obtained as a third factor by Sternberg et al . For example , some of the behaviors in the Sternberg et al . study that showed high loadings on the Verbal Ability factorâ€”converses well , displays a good vocabulary , is verbally fluent , is knowledgeable about a particular fieldâ€”are very similar to behaviors from the present study . The same is true for the other factors . Thus , to the extent that there are past precedents for any of the data sets , the present data are consistent with the previous ones . Third , the substantive dimensions are con - sistent with the earlier statistical data ( from Experiment 1 ) indicating that of the implicit theories for the three possible pairs of attri - butes , the greatest similarity is between the implicit theories for intelligence and wisdom , whereas the least similarity is between the im - plicit theories for creativity and wisdom . Con - sider , for example , the positive polarity of the first ( and hence strongest ) dimension in each of the principal - components scaling solutions . The positive polarities of the first dimensions for intelligence and wisdomâ€”practical prob - lem - solving ability and reasoning ability , re - spectivelyâ€”are quite similar . Indeed , 5 of the 9 behaviors with the highest positive loadings on the first dimension for intelligence also are among the 10 behaviors with the highest pos - itive loadings on the first dimension for wis - dom . In contrast , the positive polarity of the first dimension for creativityâ€”nonentrench - mentâ€”is wholly different in its behavioral composition from the comparable polarities for intelligence and wisdom . Looking at the sets of dimensions as a whole reveals that wis - dom is indeed more similar to intelligence than it is to creativity , whereas the relation between intelligence and creativity is intermediate be - tween that of intelligence and wisdom , on the one hand , and that of creativity and wisdom , on the other . Fourth and perhaps most important , the di - mensions do seem to capture quite well peo - ple ' s intuitions about the nature of intelligence , creativity , and wisdom . The purpose of a mul - tidimensional scaling procedure such as that used here is not to go beyond " what we all 618 ROBERT J .

Often , when we characterize someone as " intelligent , " or " creative , " or " wise , " we are asked what we mean by the use of these terms . The data pre - sented here give a fairly clear picture of what it is that we do , in fact , mean . Experiment 3 Method Some New Haven area adults were administered four psychometric tests ( Â« = 30 ) : the Cattell and Cattell ( 1963 ) Test of g , the Group Embedded Figures Test ( Oilman , Raskin , & Witkin , 1971 ) , the George Washington Social Intelligence Test ( Moss , Hunt , Omwake , & Woodward , 1949 ) , and the Social Insight Test ( Chapin , 1967 ) . These tests have been widely used in psychometric investigations of cognitive and social intelligence and have been shown to have reasonable construct validity ( see Stemberg , 1985 ) . The cognitive intelligence tests were included because of their expected overlap with implicit theories of intelligence ; the social intelligence tests were included because of lit - erature , going back to the Book of Solomon , suggesting that wisdom derives , at least in part , from the considered application of intelligence in social contexts . Paper - and - pencil creativity tests were not used because of the view of the investigator , as well as of many other investigators in the field ( e . g . , Amabile , 1983 ; Cronbach , 1984 ; Feldman , 1980 ; Simonton , 1984 ) that such tests capture , at best , only the most trivial aspects of creativity . In addition , sub - jects were asked to fill out all three of the questionnaires from Experiment 1â€”those for intelligence , creativity , and wisdomâ€”as they pertained to themselves ( rather than as they pertained to an ideal individual , as in Experiment 1 ) . The same subjects filled out all three questionnaires in counterbalanced order . Only those questionnaire items were retained that had received first principal - component load - ings of . 50 or greater in Experiment 1 . These items were the ones that best measured what each scale as a whole measured . Subjects used a 1 - 9 rating scale , where 1 in - dicated a behavior that was extremely uncharacteristic of the individual , and 9 indicated a behavior that was ex - tremely characteristic of the individual . Subjects were given as long as they needed to complete the questionnaires . Results Questionnaires were scored by correlating each subject ' s response pattern on the given questionnaire he or she completed ( intelli - gence , wisdom , or creativity ) with the proto - type questionnaire obtained from the layper - sons in Experiment 1 . The prototype con - tained the set of ratings for the hypothetical ideal individual , with respect to either intelli - gence , creativity , or wisdom . Thus , the corre - lation measured the degree of resemblance be - tween the actual individual in this experiment and the hypothetical ideal individual emerging from Experiment 1 . A higher correlation thus indicated greater correspondence to the hy - pothetical ideal , whereas a lower correlation indicated lesser correspondence to the ideal . A negative correlation would indicate an in - verse relation to the ideal . Table 6 presents correlations between the psychometric measures derived from explicit theories and the questionnaire measures de - rived from implicit theories . The strongest correlations were obtained for intelligence . A correlation of . 48 was obtained with the Cattell and Cattell Test of g , which is a nonverbal in - telligence test . This result replicates the cor - relation with the verbal Henmon - Nelson Mental Ability Test obtained by Sternberg et al . ( 1981 ) , which was just slightly higher ( . 52 ) . The intelligence prototype - correlation mea - sure thus measures characteristics that overlap with intelligence tests , although the prototype also measures social - competence aspects of intelligence that are not measured by most traditional psychometric tests of intelligence . Significant correlations were also obtained with the Embedded Figures test ( a measure of field independence that tends to correlate with spatial ability ) and with the Chapin Social In - INTELLIGENCE , CREATIVITY , AND WISDOM 619 sight test ( a measure of social intelligence / competence ) . No significant correlations were obtained for creativity , but then , there were no creativity tests included in the battery because of the lack of adequate available batteries . Meaningful correlations were obtained for the wisdom prototype scores with the George Washington and Chapin tests . Thus , the wis - dom scale seems to come closest to measuring skills that are traditionally measured by tests of social intelligence ( or social competence ) . Discussion A question that inevitably arises in studies of implicit theories of psychological constructs is whether such theories have any external va - lidity . Put simply , what if people ' s conceptions are wrong ? The external - validation procedures in this experiment specifically address this is - sue . Correlations of scores from implicit - the - ory - based measures with scores from explicit - theory - based measures showed both conver - gent and discriminant validity : The prototype scores correlated with the psychometric tests with which they were supposed to correlate , and did not correlate with the psychometric tests with which they were not supposed to correlate . Thus , implicit theories of intelli - gence and wisdom do correspond substantially to explicit theories . ( There was no basis for making a similar determination for creativity . ) If the implicit theories are off - base , then so are the explicit theories that constitute the basis for current psychological research and mea - surement on intelligence and wisdom . The correspondence makes sense : After all , explicit theories derive largely from implicit theories of the psychological theorist ! Of course , it is quite possible that both explicit theories and implicit theories are wrong . But if this is the case , the problem is not one that applies uniquely to this particular study , but rather to all studies in the field of human abilities . Experiment 4 Method In this experiment , 40 subjects , all of whom were New Haven area adults , were presented with 54 simulated letters of recommendation . Examples of two typical letters are as follows : Gerald : He possesses ability for high achievement . He has the ability to grasp complex situations . He has good problem - solving ability . He attaches importance to well - presented ideas . Doris : She is motivated by goals . She questions societal norms , truisms , and assumptions . She thinks quickly . She is not materialistic . She is totally absorbed in study . Descriptions were generated so as to vary predicted levels of intelligence , creativity , and wisdom . Each description was either four , five , or six sentences in length , and was paired equally often with names of males and with names of females . A given subject saw a given description only onceâ€”either with a male name or with a female name . The subjects ' task was to rate the intelligence , creativity , and wisdom of each of the described subjects . The ratings were made in a Latin - square order across subjects , so that each rating occurred equally often in each ordinal position . Ratings were made on a 9 - point scale , where 1 indicated that the individual to be rated was not at all ( intelligent , creative , wise ) , and 9 indicated that the individual was ex - tremely ( intelligent , creative , wise ) . It was possible to obtain predicted ratings for intelligence , creativity , and wisdom by summing up the ratings of laypersons from Experiment 1 on each attribute for each subject , and then dividing by the number of attributes given for the hypothetical indi - vidual . Averages rather than sums of ratings were used be - cause the number of behaviors was not the same for each of the descriptions . Suppose , for example , that five behaviors were given for Susan . The predicted intelligence rating would be the mean of the characteristicness ratings for intelligence in Exper - iment I ( plus a constant ) . The predicted creativity rating would be the mean of the first experiment ' s ratings for creativity ( plus a constant ) . The predicted wisdom rating would be the mean of the first experiment ' s ratings for wisdom ( plus a constant ) . Thus , the more closely the de - scription of the hypothetical individual resembles the ideal ( of Experiment I ) on each of the three attributes ( intelli - gence , creativity , wisdom ) , the higher should be the rating that hypothetical individual receives in the present exper - iment . Results Table 7 presents the results for this experi - ment . The main results are presented in three successive panels of data . As can be seen in the first panel , the mean rating for intelligence was the highest , and the mean for creativity was the lowest . Ratings were highly reliable , across split halves of both subjects and items . Consider next the correlational pattern pre - sented in the second panel . As would be ex - pected from Experiment 1 , involving ratings of abstract ideals , the highest correlation be - 620 ROBERT J . STERNBERG tween pairs of ratings was that between intel - ligence and wisdom . Correlations with cre - ativity were lower . Also as would be expected from the first experiment , the lowest correla - tion was between the ratings of creativity and wisdom . Thus , the ratings of hypothetical - de - scribed individuals in this experiment showed the same pattern as the ratings of hypothetical ideal individuals in Experiment 1 . Note that the correlations between items across genders for names were all in the mid - to high - 90s . Thus , the pattern of ratings was very similar , regardless of the sex of the hypothetical indi - vidual being rated . Moreover , mean ratings were the same for the two genders to the nearest tenth of a point . Hence , levels of ratings as well as patterns were the same across the gen - ders of the hypothetical individuals . If the implicit theories are functioning as they ought to , then the correlations of the pre - dicted and observed ratings for the hypothet - ical individuals should show convergent and discriminant validity . Such validity would be shown if the correlation between predicted and observed values was higher within - attribute than between - attributes . In other words , the best predictor of the observed intelligence rat - ings should be the predicted intelligence rat - ings . The best predictor of the observed cre - ativity ratings should be the predicted creativ - ity ratings . And the best predictor of the observed wisdom ratings should be the pre - dicted wisdom ratings . Lack of convergent - discriminant validity would be shown if , for example , predictions for the creativity score correlated higher with the observed intelligence Table 7 Results for " Letters of Recommendation " Study Measure M SD Subject reliability Item reliability Basic statistics Intelligence Creativity Wisdom 5 . 8 5 . 0 5 . 3 1 . 7 1 . 7 1 . 8 . 98 . 97 . 98 . 84 . 93 . 85 Intelligence Creativity Wisdom Male - Female names Intercorrelations of ratings Intelligence Creativity Wisdom 1 . 00 . 69 1 . 00 . 94 . 62 1 . 00 . 97 . 94 . 95 Predicted Observed Intelligence Creativity Wisdom Simple correlations between predicted and observed ratings Intelligence CreativityWisdom . 89 " * . 48 * * * . 87 * * * . 46 * " . 89 " * . 40 " . 54 * " . 96 " * Standardized regression coefficients Dependent variable Intelligence Creativity Wisdom Multiple regression of observed ratings on predicted ratings IntelligenceCreativityWisdom . 85 * * * . 87 * " . 92 * * * . 64 * * * - . 20 . 06 . 27 " 1 . 24 * * * . 16 * . 42 " . 42 * " . 98 * " 5 .

If the results do indeed show both convergent and discriminant validity , then one would expect correlations between predicted and observed values to be highest in the main diagonal of the third panel . In other words , the ratings of Experiment 1 for , say , intelligence , should best predict the ratings of Experiment 3 for intelligence , as opposed to creativity or wisdom . The corresponding pattern should hold for the ratings of creativity and wisdom . As can be seen in the third panel , the corre - . lation in the main diagonal is , in every case , the highest correlation in each row and col - umn . However , the ratings of intelligence and wisdom were close , and not clearly distin - guishable , especially for the predictions of wis - dom and intelligence with respect to the actual ratings of the intelligence of the described hy - pothetical individuals . These results are con - sistent with the earlier results suggesting that intelligence and wisdom are perceived to be more closely related to each other than is either in relation to creativity . Finally , multiple regression was used to pre - dict the ratings of Experiment 4 via the pre - dictions for intelligence , creativity , and wisdom deriving from Experiment 1 . In these regres - sions , one would expect the highest standard - ized regression coefficient for that behavior in the prediction that corresponds to the observed behavior . Thus , the regression weight in pre - dicting the intelligence ratings should be higher for the intelligence prediction than for either of the creativity or wisdom predictions , and similarly for the other sets of weights . Again , as above , the values in the main diagonal are the highest ones in each row and column , sup - porting this prediction . The implicit theories thus show both convergent and discriminant validity . Discussion Implicit theories would not be of much in - terest if they merely resided statically in peo - ple ' s heads , or if they were merely created at time of test to suit the needs of experimenters doing studies on such theories . The results of the present study show not only that people have such theories , but that they use such the - ories in their evaluations of others . Despite the seeming omnipresence of standardized tests in our society , by far the largest proportion of evaluations of people ' s abilities are informal and observational rather than formal and psy - chometric : Most judgments of people ' s intel - ligence , creativity , and wisdom result from in - terpretations of face - to - face interactions , letters of recommendation , comments received sec - ond - hand from third parties , and the like . Psy - chometric tests tell us nothing about how these informal evaluations are made . The results of this experiment show that the implicit - theo - retical tests do . People use their implicit the - ories to make these judgments , and thus the judgments can be predicted from such theo - ries , as was done here . As would be expected on the basis of the results of the previous experiments , people have the most difficulty in distinguishing in - telligence and wisdom in such judgments . But they are able to distinguish intelligence from creativity , and creativity from wisdom , quite well in these judgments . To the extent we are concerned , therefore , with how judgments of abilities are actually made in the everyday world , the study of implicit theories has at least as much relevance as does the study of explicit theories , and perhaps even more relevance . General Discussion This study sought to discover the nature and use of people ' s implicit theories of intelligence , creativity , and wisdom . A prestudy and four experiments were conducted in order to fulfill this goal . The prestudy served merely to pro - vide a comprehensive list of behaviors asso - ciated with intelligence , creativity , and wisdom in each of four fields , as well as in general . Principal Experimental Outcomes Experiment 1 showed that , in general , in - telligence , creativity , and wisdom are perceived as positively correlated attributes in people , although intelligence and wisdom are more closely related than is either of these two con - structs to creativity . Ratings did not differ sig - nificantly across groups in terms of mean levels of particular attributes . Experiment 2 revealed dimensions of im - plicit theories of intelligence , creativity , and wisdom in nonspecialists . Because principal - axis solutions were used in nonmetric multidimensional scaling , bipolar dimensions 622 ROBERT J . STERNBERG emerged . Separate interpretations were given to the positive and negative polarity of each dimension . For intelligence , these interpreta - tions were : practical problem - solving ability , verbal ability ( Dimension 1 ) ; intellectual bal - ance and integration , goal orientation and attainment ( Dimension 2 ) ; contextual intel - ligence , fluid thought ( Dimension 3 ) . For creativity , the interpretations were : non - entrenchment , integration and intellectuality ( Dimension 1 ) ; aesthetic taste and imagination , decisional skill and flexibility ( Dimension 2 ) ; perspicacity , drive for accomplishment and recognition ( Dimension 3 ) ; inquisitiveness , intuition ( Dimension 4 ) . For wisdom , the in - terpretations were : reasoning ability , sagacity ( Dimension 1 ) ; learning from ideas and envi - ronment , judgment ( Dimension 2 ) ; expedi - tious use of information , perspicacity ( Di - mension 3 ) . On the whole , the dimensions seem to be plausible , and to fit intuitively with commonsense notions of intelligence , creativ - ity , and wisdom , respectively . In Experiment 3 , subjects rated themselves on a subset of the entire list of behaviors gen - erated in the Prestudy . These ratings were cor - related with the ideal - prototype ratings from Experiment 1 to yield a measure of resem - blance ( r ) between the actual individual and the ideal prototype . These correlations were then correlated with scores on psychometric tests of ability . The prototype measure for in - telligence showed its greatest correlations with psychometric tests of cognitive intelligence , whereas the prototype measure for wisdom showed its greatest correlations with psycho - metric tests of social intelligence . The creativity prototype measure did not correlate with ei - ther kind of test , but because of doubts about their appropriateness as measures of creativity , psychometric tests of creativity were not used . The correlations for intelligence and wisdom , at least , showed convergent - discriminant val - idation with respect to the psychometric mea - sures used . In Experiment 4 , subjects were presented with simulated letters of recommendation for hypothetical individuals . Subjects had to rate the intelligence , creativity , and wisdom of each hypothetical individual . Results were of the same pattern and at the same level , regardless of whether a given description was paired with a male name or a female name . Predictions based on ratings from Experiment 2 showed high correlations with observed ratings in this experiment . Moreover , the results again showed convergent and discriminant validity , with the predictions for intelligence better pre - dicting observed ratings of intelligence than of creativity or wisdom , and with comparable re - sults for the other two constructs . Contents of and Comparisons among Implicit Theories Laypersons . A maj or goal of this study was to attain some sense of just how laypersons ' implicit theories of intelligence , creativity , and wisdom are similar to and different from each other . The results of the experiments , and especially of Experiment 2 , were useful in at - taining a sense of the similarities and differ - ences . People ' s conceptions of intelligence overlap with , but go beyond , the skills measured by conventional intelligence tests . Thus , the problem - solving ( fluid ability ) and verbal comprehension ( crystallized ability ) skills measured by intelligence tests appear most prominently in the dimensions of the derived implicit theory of intelligence . Thus , the in - telligent individual is perceived to solve prob - lems well , reason clearly , think logically , show a good vocabulary , and draw on a large store of informationâ€”just the kinds of things con - ventional intelligence tests measure . But also embedded within people ' s conceptions of in - telligence are a person ' s ability to balance in - formation , to be goal - oriented and to aim for achievement of one ' s goals , and to show one ' s intelligence in worldly , as opposed to strictly academic , contexts . People thus seem to be more concerned with the practical and worldly side of intelligence than are intelligence testers . Conceptions of creativity overlap with those of intelligence , but there is much less emphasis in implicit theories of creativity on analytical abilities , whether they be directed toward ab - stract problems or toward verbal materials . For example , the very first dimension shows a greater emphasis on nonentrenchment , or the ability and willingness to go beyond ordinary limitations of self and environment and to think and act in unconventional and even dreamlike ways . The creative individual has a certain freedom of spirit and unwillingness to INTELLIGENCE , CREATIVITY , AND WISDOM 623 be bound by the unwritten canons of society , characteristics not necessarily found in the highly intelligent individual . Implicit theories of creativity encompass a dimension of aes - thetic taste and imagination that is absent in implicit theories of intelligence , and also en - compass aspects of inquisitiveness and intu - itiveness that do not seem to enter into the implicit theories of intelligence . Implicit the - ories of creativity go far beyond conventional psychometric creativity tests . A person ' s ability to think of unusual uses of a brick , or to form a picture based on a geometric outline , scarcely does justice to the kind of freedom of spirit and intellect captured in people ' s implicit the - ories of creativity . Finally , the wise individual is perceived to have much the same analytical reasoning abil - ity that is found in the intelligent individual . But the wise person has a certain sagacity not necessarily found in the intelligent person : He or she listens to others , knows how to weigh advice , and can deal with a variety of different kinds of people . In seeking as much infor - mation as possible for decision making , the wise individual reads between the lines as well as makes use of the obviously available infor - mation . The wise individual is especially able to make clear , sensible , and fair judgments , and in doing so , takes a long - term as well as a short - term view of the consequences of the judg - ments made . The wise individual is perceived to profit from the experience of others , and to learn from others ' mistakes , as well as from his or her own . This individual is not afraid to change his or her mind as experience dic - tates , and the solutions that are offered to complex problems tend to be the right ones . It is not surprising that the correlations be - tween creativity and wisdom are the lowest of the three possible pairs ( intelligence - creativity , intelligence - wisdom , creativity - wisdom ) , and in one case , the correlation is even negative : Whereas the wise person is perceived to be a conserver of worldly experience , the creative person is perceived to be a defier of such ex - perience . Specialists . Implicit theories of intelligence , creativity , and wisdom differ as a function of the field of endeavor by whom and for whom the implicit theory is being assessed . ( There was no separation in the relevant experimentâ€” Experiment 1â€”between who was making the ratings and for whom they were made . Thus , physicists , for example , were not asked their conceptions of intelligence or creativity as they apply to philosophers , or vice versa . Measure - ment of cross - field conceptions would more likely tap conceptions created on the spot than to tap conceptions previously present in in - dividuals ' thinking , and would probably be of doubtful validity . Moreover , such assessment would have resulted in the need for data col - lection on a scale that exceeded our capabili - ties ! ) Consider each of intelligence , creativity , and wisdom in turn . Whereas the professors of art emphasize knowledge and the ability to use that knowl - edge in weighing alternative possibilities and in seeing analogies , the business professors emphasize the ability to think logically , to fo - cus on essential aspects of a problem , and both to follow others ' arguments easily and to see where these arguments lead . The emphasis on assessment of argumentation in the business professors ' implicit theories is far weaker in the artists ' implicit theories . The philosophy professors emphasize critical and logical abil - ities very heavily , and especially the ability to follow complex arguments , to find subtle mis - takes in these arguments , and to generate counterexamples to invalid arguments . The philosophers ' view very clearly emphasizes those aspects of logic and rationality that are essential in analyzing and creating philosoph - ical arguments . The physicist , in contrast , places more emphasis on precise mathematical thinking , the ability to relate physical phe - nomena to the concepts of physics , and to grasp quickly the laws of nature . In sum , al - though there is considerable agreement across fields , there are also emphases in each field on the kinds of intelligent thought that are needed particularly for success in the given discipline . This specialization in parts of the implicit the - ories of intelligence is absent from the implicit theories of the laypersons . Implicit theories of creativity in the spe - cialized fields were highly overlapping across fields and also overlapped highly with the im - plicit theories of laypersons ; nevertheless , there were some differences worthy of note . Profes - sors of art placed heavy emphasis on imagi - nation and originality , as well as upon an abundance of and willingness to try out new ideas . The creative artist is a risk - taker , and 624 ROBERT J . STERNBERG persists in following through on the conse - quences of risks . Such a person thinks meta - phorically , and prefers forms of communica - tion other than strictly verbal ones . Business professors also emphasize the ability of the creative individual to come up with new ideas and to explore these ideas , especially as they relate to novel business services or products . The creative individual escapes traps of con - ventional thinking , and can imagine a possible state that is quite different from what exists . Philosophy professors emphasize the ability to toy imaginatively with notions and combina - tions of ideas , and to create classifications and systematizations of knowledge that differ from the conventional ones . Creative individuals never automatically accept the " accepted , " and when they have novel hunches , these hunches pay off . The creative person is particularly well able to generate insights regarding connections between seemingly unrelated issues , and to form useful analogies and explanations . The physics professors share many of these same ideas about the creative individual , but show a particular concern with inventiveness , the ability to find order in chaos , and the ability to question basic principles . The physicists emphasize creative aspects of problem solving , such as the ability to approximate solutions , the ability to find shortcuts in problem solving , and the ability to go beyond standard methods of problem solving . Finally , the physicist looks in a creative person for the ability to make discoveries by looking for reasons why things happen the way they do . Such discoveries may result from the perception of physical and other patterns that most others simply over - look . As was the case for intelligence , the im - plicit theories of the laypersons seem to be an amalgamation of these different views without the specializations that appear in the implicit theories of individuals from particular fields of endeavor . Implicit theories of wisdom show consid - erable overlap across fields of specialization . Nevertheless , there are some differences in im - plicit theories . Art professors emphasize in - sight , knowing how to balance logic and in - stinct , knowing how to transform creativity into concepts , and sensitivity . These aspects of wisdom would seem quite relevant in the ma - ture appreciation and evaluation of art . Busi - ness professors emphasize maturity of judg - ment , understanding of the limitations of one ' s actions and recommendations , knowing what one does and does not know , possession of a long - term perspective on things , knowing when not to act as well as when one should act , ac - ceptance of reality , good decision making , the ability to distinguish substance from style , and appreciation of the ideologies of others . These aspects of wisdom would seem particularly relevant in making and evaluating business decisions . Philosophy professors emphasize balanced judgment , nonautomatic acceptance of the " accepted " wisdom , concentration on fundamental questions , resistance to fads , looking for fundamental - principles or intu - itions behind a viewpoint , concern with larger purposes , openness to ideas , ability to use facts correctly , avoidance of jargon , possession of a sense of where future progress is possible , un - willingness to become obsessed with a single theory , attention to both detail and scope , and a sense of justice . All of these talents would seem relevant to the construction and evalu - ation of philosophical arguments . Finally , physicists emphasize appreciation of the var - ious factors that contribute to a situation , fa - miliarization with previous work and tech - niques in the field , knowing if solving a prob - lem is likely to produce important results , awareness of the important problems in the field , knowledge of the human and political elements of scientific work , contemplation , and recognition of the aspects of physical phe - nomena that underlie the concepts of physics . These skills would seem to be helpful in at - taining a deep understanding of the nature of physics and its place both in science and in the world . The Role of Implicit Theories in Psychological Research The present study suggests that implicit theories can provide a useful way of gaining a " lay of the land " in the search for understand - ing of the constructs of intelligence , creativity , and wisdom . The results were construct - valid in terms of convergent and discriminant va - lidity , and also were consistent with but more detailed than previous results from studies of implicit theories . For example , the nonmetric INTELLIGENCE , CREATIVITY , AND WISDOM 625 multidimensional scaling results for intelli - gence were an elaboration of the factor - analytic results of Sternberg et al . ( 1981 ) . The results are also in good agreement with many explicit theories of intelligence ( e . g . , Guilford , 1967 ; Sternberg , 1985 ) , especially those that expand the notion of intelligence to include social and practical competencies as well as academic ones . The scaling results for wisdom also con - firmed and elaborated on those of Clayton and Birren ( 1980 ) , using the same technique but a very different method for generating behaviors . Our reasoning polarity closely resembles Clayton and Birren ' s reflective dimension , and our sagacity polarity closely resembles their affective one . Although there have been no comparable multivariate studies of creativity , per se , our results are in accord with those of MacKinnon ( 1964 ) and others who have used Q - sorts and self - ratings for creative individuals . Indeed , all of the adjectives that characterized MacKinnon ' s highly creative sample seem classifiable in terms of our multidimensional space . Although I have emphasized the role of im - plicit theories as precursors to explicit theories and as useful in setting the groundwork for explicit theories , I believe that implicit theories are also of interest in their own right . Implicit theories of intelligence , creativity , and wisdom are of interest in their own right because ( a ) the termsâ€” intelligence , creativity , wisdom â€” are frequently used in everyday discourse as well as in psychological discourse with no or minimal definition , and it is useful to know what people mean when they use these terms ; ( b ) people evaluate the intelligence , creativity , and wisdom of themselves and others with some regularity , and it is worthwhile to know the psychological bases on which these evalu - ations are made ; ( c ) as people make these judgments , it is helpful to know to what extent they correlate with measures derived from ex - plicit theories , such as psychometric tests ; and ( d ) the implicit theories may eventually help us broaden and change our explicit theories , as we come to realize those aspects of cognition or affect that the current explicit theories of intelligence , creativity , and wisdom do not en - compass , but possibly , should encompass . Thus , the study of implicit theories is not merely an easy substitute for the formation and study of explicit theories of psychological con - structs . Implicit theories deserve to be studied in their own right , and such study is comple - mentary to the study of explicit theories . Although understanding of implicit theories is important , both for its own sake and for the sake of developing better explicit theories , it is important not to confuse implicit theories with explicit ones . The test of an account of implicit theories , such as this account , is whether it ac - curately and fully reflects the notions people have in their heads , and the ways in which these notions are systematized . The test of an explicit theory is whether it can account for observable performance generated by the psychological construct under investigation . People could be wrong , underinclusive , or overinclusive in their notions of psychological constructs . Hence , investigations of implicit theories must be supplemented and related to investigations motivated by explicit theories . Although any study such as this has nu - merous limitations , it is worth pointing out three particularly important ones . First , the study is not developmental in its study of im - plicit theories . Yet , the work of Yussen and Kane ( 1985 ) , Berg and Sternberg ( in press ) , Cornelius ( 1984 ) , and others shows that im - plicit theories of intelligence change over the life span . The work of Csikszentmihalyi and Robinson ( in press ) , Gruber ( in press ) , and others shows changes over the life span in the nature of creativity , and the work of Clayton and Birren ( 1980 ) and of Dittmann - Kohli and Baltes ( in press ) shows changes in the nature of wisdom . Hence , the present results may ap - ply readily only to early and middle adulthood . Second , the study is fixed at a moment in time . Conceptions of constructs such as intelligence , creativity , and wisdom may change over the years , so that a study done at one time can be confidently interpreted as accurately reflecting implicit theories only for the time period in which it was done . Finally , the study is limited to one particular culture , rather than being cross - cultural . Although the present results may apply fairly broadly within our own mainstream culture , there is good evidence to suggest that conceptions of constructs such as intelligence , creativity , and wisdom differ cross - culturally ( Sternberg , in press ) . In conclusion , people have implicit theories 626 ROBERT J . STERNBERG of intelligence , creativity , and wisdom , and they use these theories both in judging them - selves and in judging others . They seem to use these theories quite well and systematically . At least in the domains of creativity and wisdom , and possibly in that of intelligence as well , it remains to be seen whether we can obtain as good measurement through measures based on explicit theories as we can obtain from measurements based on implicit ones .
