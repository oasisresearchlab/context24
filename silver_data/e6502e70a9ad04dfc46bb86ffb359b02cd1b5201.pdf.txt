Gardner 1 , 2 , 3 Abstract Many of the gene mutations found in genetic disorders , including cancer , result in premature termination codons ( PTC ) andtherapiddegradationoftheirmRNAsbynonsense - mediatedRNAdecay ( NMD ) . Weusedvirtual library screening , targeting a pocket in the SMG7 protein , a key component of the NMD mechanism , to identify compounds that disrupt the SMG7 – UPF1 complex and inhibit NMD . Several of these compounds upregulated NMD - targeted mRNAs at nanomolar concentrations , with minimal toxicity in cell - based assays . As expected , pharmacologic NMD inhibition disrupted SMG7 – UPF1 interactions . When used in cells with PTC - mutated p53 , pharmacologic NMD inhibition combined with a PTC " read - through " drug led to restoration of full - length p53 protein , upregulation of p53 downstream transcripts , and cell death . These studies serve as proof - of - concept that pharmacologic NMD inhibitors can restore mRNA integrity in the presence of PTC and can be used as part of a strategy to restore full - length protein in a variety of genetic diseases . Cancer Res ; 74 ( 11 ) ; 1 – 10 . (cid:1) 2014 AACR . Introduction Human genetic disorders are caused by diverse types of mutations . Manyofthesemutations , includingnonsensemuta - tions , frameshift mutations , and mutations that cause alter - native splicing events , result in premature termination codons ( PTC ) . For example , approximately 15 % of the mutations leading to Duchenne muscular dystophy , 10 % of the mutations responsibleforcystic ﬁ brosis , andcommon b - globinmutations responsible for thalassemia are PTC mutations ( 1 – 3 ) . It has been estimated that up to 30 % of all mutations resulting in human genetic disorders result in PTCs ( 4 ) . In addition , many acquired mutations in cancer , including those that disable p53 and BRCA1 , ATM , VHL , and NF1 and NF2 , result in PTCs ( 5 ) . Many transcripts carrying a PTC are targeted for rapid degradation before they can be translated into protein through a multistep process termed nonsense - mediated RNA decay ( NMD ) . The molecular mechanism of NMD has not been fully delineated , though working models have been proposed . Dur - ing the processing of mammalian pre - mRNA , introns are excised and marked by a multiprotein exon junction complex ( EJC ; refs . 6 – 8 ) . When the translation complex pauses at a PTC that is upstream of an EJC , eukaryotic release factors recruit the RNA helicase UPF1 , a vital component of the NMD mech - anism ( 9 ) . UPF1then associates with UPF2 , a component ofthe EJC , and is phosphorylated at several sites by SMG1 ( 10 ) . Phosphorylated UPF1 recruits SMG7 and SMG5 , two 14 - 3 - 3 proteins that each bind to UPF1 and form a heterodimer , and results inthe dephosphorylation ofUPF - 1 by PP2A ( 11 , 12 ) . The phosphorylation anddephosphorylationofUPF1arenecessary steps before the degradation of the transcript by exonucleases ( 12 , 13 ) . One approach to treat genetic disorders and to restore tumor - suppressor genes with PTC mutations is to pharmaco - logically promote ribosomes to read - through a PTC and pro - duce a full - length protein ( 14 ) . For example , treating cells with the antibiotic gentamicin increases the full - length expression of both PTC - mutated b - globin and PTC - mutated p53 ( 15 , 16 ) . Gentamicin treatmentofcellswithPTCmutations ofthecystic ﬁ brosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) can increase cellular chloride transport ( 17 , 18 ) and patients with PTC mutations treated with intranasal gentamicin increase CFTR protein expression and improve the potential difference of nasal epithelial cells ( 19 ) . Although application of gentami - cin or the closely related geneticin ( G418 ) is not practical clinically , a recent high - throughput screen identi ﬁ ed a small molecule , Ataluren , which has similar properties but seems to be more potent and less toxic ( 20 ) , and the use of antisense oligonucleotides to promote exon skipping are also being tested in muscular dystrophy ( reviewed in ref . 21 ) . The clinical activities of these approaches are likely to be enhanced with higher cellular concentrations of PTC - mutated mRNA . Indeed , in vitro experiments have demonstrated that the expression of PTC - mutated CFTR , as well as CFTR - mediated chloride trans - port , is improved in gentamicin - treated cells when UPF1 or UPF2 are also depleted ( 22 ) .

CAN - 13 - 2235 Because translation is necessary for NMD ( 23 ) , inhibitors of translation are effective inhibitors of NMD ( 24 ) . Unfortunately these drugs are not candidates for clinical therapies because of general toxicity and , as translation is inhibited , the ultimate goal of restoring protein expression is not achieved . We have recently demonstrated that NMD inhibition can be achieved via other mechanisms . Speci ﬁ cally , we have shown that phos - phorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2 a by a variety of cellular stresses inhibits NMD ( 5 , 25 , 26 ) . We have also determined that modest ( 80 % ) depletion of UPF1 or UPF2 can suppress NMD activity without diminishing the prolifer - ation or survival of cells ( 26 ) . These observations suggest that the pharmacologic inhibition of NMD can be achieved with limited toxicity or adverse effects . We hypothesized that the combination of a drug that can bypass a PTC and / or promote exon skipping in combination with a drug that inhibits NMD would be a synergistic combination and serve as an effective platform to treat genetic diseases . To pursue this approach , we performed a virtual screen to identify commercially available compounds predicted to dock within a SMG7 pocket previ - ously shown to be vital in the binding of UPF1 . We then tested whetherthese compoundsinterferewithNMD , andusingPTC - mutated p53 as a proof - of - principle model , whether the phar - macologic inhibition of NMD would make ribosomal read - through strategies more effective in producing full - length proteins . Materials and Methods Virtual library screening The crystallographic structure of SMG7 ( PDB ID , 1ya0 ) was analyzed using the PocketFinder algorithm available in the Internal Coordinate Mechanics ( ICM ) software program ( Mol - soft , LLC ) . An appropriately sized pocket ( based on criteria previously reported in ref . 27 ) was selected as the target site for virtual library screening ( VLS ) using ICM - VLS software ( Mol - soft , LLC ) . ICM - VLS uses global optimization with a biased probability Monte Carloconformational search torapidly dock fully ﬂ exible , full - atom models of the ligands to a set of grid potential maps calculated from the coordinates of the atoms in the protein receptor . Each ligand - docking conformation is then evaluated with a scoring function . The ICM - scoring functionintegratesvanderWaalsenergy , electrostatics , hydro - gen bonding , conformational entropy loss , and solvation elec - trostatic energy change ( 28 ) . ICM - VLS was used to dock the entire set of 436 , 115 compounds from the ChemBridge Express Library using default ICM - docking parameters on three 3 . 0 - GHz Intel Xeon processors . Cell lines and reagents U2OS , Hela , 293 , BJ - hTERT ( BJ - human telomerase reverse transcriptase ) , PBMC ( peripheral blood mononuclear cell ) , MDA231 , DU145 , T98G , and HCT116 cells were grown as previously described ( 29 , 30 ) . N417 cells were grown in RPMI containing 10 % FBS . Calu - 6 ( gift of E . Welch ) and HDQP1 cell lines ( DSMZ German Collection of Microorganism and Cell Cultures ) were grown in Dulbecco ' s Modi ﬁ ed Eagle Medium with 10 % FBS . Pools of b - globin mRNA – expressing cells were generated as previously described ( 25 ) . Compounds were obtained from Chembridge . UPF1 shRNA ( short hairpin RNA ; ref . 26 ) and SMG7 shRNA ( TRCN0000127998 ) were obtained from Sigma . Primer sequences for b - globin , endogenous NMD targets , p53 , and p53 downstream targets are available upon request . Immunoblots and RNA assessment Immunoblots were prepared as previously described ( 29 ) and membranes were probed with antibodies against p53 ( Abcam Inc . ; ab26 ) , SMG1 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . ; 6 - RE13 ) , UPF1 / Rent1 ( SC H - 300 ) , SMG7 ( A302 - 170A ; Bethyl Laboratories , Inc . ) . Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously ( 10 ) . Brie ﬂ y , cells were lysed and incu - bated 30 minutes at 4 (cid:1) C with buffer containing 50 mmol / L Tris - HCL at pH 7 . 4 , 50 mmol / L NaCL , 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 , 10 mmol / L tetrasodium pyrophosphate , 100 mmol / L NaF , 17 . 5 mmol / L b - glycerophosphate , 1mmol / Lphenylmethylsulfonyl - ﬂ uoride , and protease inhibitor ( Roche ) . Lysates were clari ﬁ ed and incubated with 200 m g / mL RNaseA ( Qiagen ) at room temperature for 15 minutes with gentle rotation before 4 (cid:1) C overnight immunoprecipitation with the appropriate antibo - dies . Isolation of RNA for cDNA generation , real - time PCR ( RT - PCR ) , DRB ( 5 , 6 - dichloro - 1 - b - D - ribofuranosylbenzimidazole ) treatment , RNA stability experiment , expression pro ﬁ ling , and expressionarraydataanalysiswereasdescribedpreviously ( 25 , 26 ) . For unbiased gene expression experiments , cells were treated with 50 m mol / L NMDI14 for 6 hours , 100 m g / mL emetine for 3 hours , or depleted of UPF1 and RNA was harvested , prepared , hybridized to Affymetrix HG - U133 Plus 2 . 0 GeneChips and analyzed as previously described ( 26 ) . Cell viability assay and proliferation assay To assess viability , cells were cultured in 6 - well dishes and incubated with dimethylsulfoxide ( DMSO ) , G418 , NMDI ( NMD inhibitor ) alone , or G418 with NMDI together for the indicated hours . After incubations , cells and media were collected and cells viability was measured as described ( 31 ) . To assess cell proliferation U2OS , Hela , and BJ - hTERT cells were cultured in 6 - well plates and , after 24 hours , treated with NMDI14 for 0 , 24 , 48 , and 72 hours . The cells were collected and viable cells were counted by using the Countess Automated Cell Counter ( Invitrogen ) . Protein synthesis ( 35 S incorporation assay ) U2OS , Hela , and BJ - hTERT cells were incubated with DMSO , NMDI14 , or emetine as indicated . The cells were labeled with 100 m Ci / mL [ 35 S ] Methionine for 30 minutes and the protein were precipitated using the standard trichloroacetic acid precipitation method as described previously ( 26 ) . The pre - cipitated protein was collected in glass ﬁ ber ﬁ lters and [ 35 S ] Methionine incorporation was measured by using liquid scintillation counter ( PerkinElmer , Inc . ) . Results Identi ﬁ cation of potential NMD inhibitors Prior studies have demonstrated that NMD activity is dependent on the formation of a UPF1 – SMG7 complex ( Fig . 1A ) , which has been crystallographically resolved ( 11 ) .

CAN - 13 - 2235 Though UPF1 and SMG7 may have additional non - NMD roles , the interaction between the two seems to be unique for NMD . Thus , the disruption of this complex is an ideal target for NMD inhibition while minimizing the toxicity that might be seen with other known mechanism of NMDIs , including translation inhibitors and inducers of eIF2 a phosphorylation ( 24 , 25 ) . We elected to take a three - dimensional ( 3D ) structure activity approach to NMDI discovery by targeting this protein interface . Only one pocket on the 3D structure of SMG7 was both of suitable size and volume ( between 150 and 550A 3 ) and was lined with functionally sensitive amino acid side chains that mediate the interaction with UPF1 ( Fig . 1B ; ref . 11 ) . This pocket was selected as the target site for VLS of a collection of 436 , 115compoundsfromtheChemBridgeExpressLibrary . The resulting compounds achieving a docking score of < (cid:3) 32 ( see Materials andMethods ) were further ﬁ ltered by selecting those with extensive hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts , followed by hierarchical clustering for a diversity of scaffolds , resulting in the identi ﬁ cation of 31 diverse compounds highly structurally and chemically compatible with the target SMG7 pocket ( Fig . 1C and D ) . Identi ﬁ ed compounds inhibit NMD in a cell - based assay To test these putative NMDIs , we used a common and straight – forward assayforNMD . We ﬁ rstgenerated ﬁ broblasts stably expressing either a wild - type b - globin construct or a PTC 39 - mutated b - globin gene construct well established to be degraded by NMD ( 32 ) . In our initial screen , we treated cells expressing these genomic constructs with 50 m mol / L of the 31 identi ﬁ ed compounds for 6 hours , a condition that led to no A r ea ( A 2 ) Volume ( A 3 ) 500 400 300 200 200 300 400 500 Volumes and areas 1 2 3 4 5 6 78 9 10 11 12 A B D C EJC Figure 1 .

CAN - 13 - 2235 gross toxicity in these cells . RNA was then harvested and expression of PTC b - globin and wild - type b - globin mRNA was determined using RT - PCR . We identi ﬁ ed 10 compounds that selectively increased the expression level of PTC 39 b - globin greater than two - fold , without affecting wild - type b - globin expression , with a P value of < 0 . 05 ( Fig . 2A ) . Because of rapid degradation by NMD , the steady - state mRNA expression of the PTC39 b - globin was approximately 3 % of the wild - type b - globin expression . Treat - ing cells with NMDI14 for 6 hours , for example , led to an increase of PTC 39 b - globin to 12 % , a relative four - fold increase that , if resulting in biologically active hemoglobin , would be suf ﬁ cient to ameliorate the clinical symptoms of thalassemia ( Fig . 2B ) . When these 10 compounds were tested at decreasing concentrations , we identi ﬁ ed several NMDIs active at nano - molar concentrations , with some active over a wide range of concentrations and others exhibiting more narrow effective concentration , which peaked at micromolar concentrations and displayed even a biphasic effect ( Fig . 2C and data not shown ) . These compounds , previously not reported to affect NMD , represent a diverse group of chemical scaffolds ( Fig . 2D and data not shown ) . We chose to focus the majority of our further studies on one of these compounds , ethyl 2 - { [ ( 6 , 7 – dimethyl – 3 - oxo - 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 - tetrahydro - 2 - quinoxalinyl ) acet - yl ] amino } - 4 , 5 - dimethyl - 3 - thiophenecarboxylate ( NMDI14 ) , which demonstrated dose - dependent activity , with signi ﬁ - cant activity at low concentrations . Although the activity of our identi ﬁ ed NMDIs does not depend on the mechanism of action , because these drugs were screened in silico to ﬁ t into the SMG7 pocket necessary to bind Figure 2 .

CAN - 13 - 2235 UPF1 , we expected that NMDI14 would interfere with the interaction of UPF1 and SMG7 . We immunoprecipitated SMG7 , in the presence of RNAse and con ﬁ rmed that both overexpressed ( Fig . 2E , left ) and endogenous ( Fig . 2E , right ) SMG7 interacted with overexpressed and endogenous UPF1 , respectively , and observed that this interaction was disrupted when cells were treated with NMDI14 . NMDI can be achieved with minimal cellular toxicity in multiple cell lines NMD inhibition can result in the upregulation of nonmu - tated , mutated , andalternativelysplicedmRNAs ( 5 ) . Thus , NMD inhibition might be predicted to result in widespread biologic effects . In fact , we have recently reported that the genetic inhibition of NMD subtly but signi ﬁ cantly increases autophagy , presumably in an attempt to rid the cell of mutated and misfolded proteins that accumulate with NMD suppression ( 31 ) . To determine the cellular toxicity of select NMDIs , we assessed viability in treated Hela , U2OS , and Calu - 6 cell lines , and in immortalized / nontransformed human ﬁ broblasts . These cells were treated with 50 m mol / L of NMDI14 and two other effective NMDIs , as an assessment of any class toxicity effects , for48hours , andviabilitywasassessed . Wenotedalmost no toxicity with NMDI14 and NMDI25 , and minimal toxicity with NMDI9 , suggesting the pharmacologic inhibition of NMD is not unduly toxic in contrast with 24 hours of treatment with emetine , which blocks NMD by inhibiting translation ( Fig . 3A ) . To determine whether the effective pharmacologic inhibi - tion of NMD exerted a sublethal effect on proliferation , we assessed proliferation in NMDI14 - treated transformed and nontransformed cell lines ( Fig . 3B ) . Three days of treatment resulted in no decrease in cell counts , demonstrating that the pharmacologic inhibition of NMD can be achieved without subtle changes in proliferation . Becausesuppressionoftranslationisapotentmechanismto inhibit NMD , previously described inhibitors of NMD also inhibit translation . Although we did not predict this mecha - nism of action for our compounds , we tested protein synthesis after6to24hoursofNMDI14treatment . Duringthelasthourof treatment cells were pulsed with S 35 methionine , and protein was then precipitated and the incorporated S 35 assessed . NMDI14 had no effect on S 35 incorporation ( Fig . 3C ) . Together , these data suggest that the pharmacologic inhibition of NMD can be achieved without cellular toxicity . NMDI14 increases the expression of endogenous NMD targets The effectiveness of NMDI14 in inhibiting NMD was originally determined by assessing the expression of an NMD - degraded reporter transcript that harbors a premature stop codon ( Fig . 2 ) . Although NMD has been primarily appreciated as a mechanism to rapidly degrade mutated transcripts , we and others have demonstrated that a wide variety of nonmutated transcripts are also degraded by NMD , which have several distinct motifs , as well as unknown features , which render them sensitive to NMD ( 25 , 26 , 33 ) . We noted that the steady - state mRNA expression , re ﬂ ective of both the rate of synthesis and the rate of decay , of seven nonmutated NMD targets that we have validated ( 26 ) increased in U2OS and / or Hela cells after treatment with NMDI14 , whereas no such increase was seen in non – NMD - targeted mRNAs ( Fig . 4A ) . Figure 3 . NMDIs are not unduly toxic . A , U2OS , Hela , Calu - 6 , and BJ - hTERT cells were treated with three NMDIs at 50 m mol / L for 48 hours , and viability was assessed .

CAN - 13 - 2235 To assess potential off - target effects of NMDI14 , we used expression arrays to globally assess gene expression in U2OS cells treated with NMDI14 , emetine , or with UPF1 depletion and compared this with gene expression in control U2OS cells . Of note , 941 genes were increased > 1 . 5 - fold with NMDI14 ( Fig . 4B ) . Therewasasigni ﬁ cantoverlap ( 22 % , P ¼ 1 . 2E (cid:3) 25 , c 2 test ) of genesupregulatedbyNMDIwithgenesupregulatedbyemetinetreatment ( which inhibits NMD potently but clearly has other effects ) , and with UPF1 depletion ( 11 % ) . In comparison , 20 % of the 5 , 290 genes upregulated by emetine were also upregulated in UPF1 - depleted cells . The overlap of genes regulated by NMDI14 and those regulated by either emetine or UPF1 deple - tion is signi ﬁ cantly higher than what would be expected by chance ( (cid:7) 3 % ) . Genes upregulated by NMDI14 but not regu - lated by UPF1 or emetine , likely representative of off - target effects , werenotparticularlyenrichedinanyspeci ﬁ cfunctional group , and only demonstrated a greater than two - fold enrich - ment in ossi ﬁ cation , actin binding , and cytoskeletal binding , suggesting that NMDI14 may not have speci ﬁ c toxicities . We next determined whether our NMDIs are effective in upregulating mutated endogenously expressed mRNAs . The small - celllungcancercelllineN417hasap53tumor - suppressor genethatisdeletedononealleleandontheotherallelecarriesaPTCmutationinthe298thcodonthatrendersitatargetfor NMD ( 34 ) . When treated with an NMDI , we noted increased expression of the mutated p53 mRNA ( Fig . 4C ) . Similar effects were seen in the breast cancer HDQP - I cell line , which carries a PTC mutation in the 213th codon of the p53 gene ( 35 ) , and the lung adenocarcinoma cell line Calu - 6 , which carries a codon 196 PTC - mutated p53 ( 36 ) . The treatment of N417 cells with NMDI14 for 6 hours led to a steady - state expres - sion of p53 similar to that seen in U2OS cells ( Fig . 4D ) . No such effect was seen in cells expressing wild - type p53 in two other cell lines ( Fig . 4C ) . To directly assess p53 mRNA stability , N417 and U2OS cells were treated with vehicle or NMDI14 for 6 hours , and the RNA polymerase II inhibitor DRB was added to stop mRNA synthesis . RNA was collected at 0 , 1 . 5 , 3 , and 4 . 5 hours after addition of DRB , and expression of p53 mRNA was assessed by RT - PCR . NMDI14 signi ﬁ cantly increased the stability of PTC - mutated p53 mRNA in N417 cells , without altering the stability of wild - type p53 in NMDI - treated U2OS cells ( Fig . 4E ) . NMDI , along with a PTC " read - through " drug , increases the protein expression of endogenous NMD targets Although NMDI14 increases the stability and expression of NMD - targeted mRNAs , a clinically effective strategy demands the expression of a full - length , biologically active protein . As noted previously , there are several drugs that can promote read - through of PTCs . Although G418 has a modest effect of suppressing NMD , the most effective agent at nontoxic con - centrations , Ataluren , doesnotprotectmRNAsfromNMD ( 20 ) . We reasoned that if there were more mutated mRNA present , PTC read - through drugs might be more effective . Figure 4 . NMDIs stabilize endogenous mRNA .

CAN - 13 - 2235 Wenoted minimal expression of full - length p53 inN417 cells treated with G418 , but signi ﬁ cantly more in cells treated with both G418 and NMDI14 ( Fig . 5A ) . This increase was seen over a variety of dose concentrations of G418 , demonstrating that in the presence of NMDI14 higher full - length p53 expression can be achieved at lower and potentially less toxic G418 concen - trations ( Fig . 5B ) . Similarly , the HDQP - I and Calu - 6 cell lines , which carry p53 PTC mutations , showed signi ﬁ cant increased full - length p53 expression with the combination of G418 and NMDI14 ( Fig . 5A ) . The expression of wild - type p53 in HCT116 cells was unaltered by these treatments ( Fig . 5A ) . The effec - tiveness of the two drugs varied among cell lines , which could either re ﬂ ect variability in ribosomal read - through ( which depends on the termination codon sequence ; ref . 20 ) , or cell - type – dependent NMDI14 metabolism . Consistent with an increase in full - length / active p53 restoration , the combination ofbothdrugsledtoasynergistic increaseinmultiplep53target genes mRNAs , includingp21 , BAX , andPUMA inN417 andcells ( Fig . 5C ) . This led to an increase in the mRNA levels of the proapoptotic BAX and PUMA similar to those seen in U2OS cells ( Fig . 5D ) . As expected by the lack of p53 mRNA induction in nonmutated p53 cells with NMDI14 ( Fig . 4C ) , in p53 wild - type cell lines HCT116 and U2OS NMDIs had no effect on p53 protein expression or p53 target gene expression over a wide range of concentrations ( Fig . 5A , C and data not shown ) . Together , these data indicate that NMDIs can increase endog - enous mutated mRNAs and , in combination with a PTC bypass drug , can result in full - length protein production . The restoration of full - length p53 with NMD inhibition anda " read - through " drugleadstocelldeathincellswith a PTC - mutated p53 The frequently mutated p53 gene is a tumor suppressor that can induce apoptosis . The reestablishment of p53 in cancer cells , with or without chemo / radiation , has been a therapeutic strategy pursued in a wide variety of cancer for almost two decades , but this approach has been hampered by problems in delivery of wild - type p53 ( 37 , 38 ) . Although NMDIs are rela - tively nontoxic , we hypothesized that the combination of NMDI with a " read - through " drug would restore full - length p53 and result in a p53 - mediated cell death . We treated N417 andHDQP - Icellswithacombination ofread - through drugand a dose of NMDI14 that results in full - length p53 expression . We noted a synergistic cell death only with the combination of drugs that led to full - length p53 expression ( Fig . 5E ) . No such death was seen when G418 and NMDI14 was used on cells with wild - type p53 , including U2OS and primary PBMCs ( Fig . 5E ) . Although the combination of G418 and NMDI14 was not toxic in p53 wild - type cells , we examined a number of addi - tional cell lines as controls ( Fig . 5F ) . These included HCT116 p53 wild - type and isogenic HCT116 p53 null cells , to determine whether the combination of NMDI14 and G418 is toxic only to cells without a functional p53 . We also tested the breast cancer cell line MDA - 231 , the prostate cancer cell line DU145 , and the glioblastoma celllineT98G , allofwhichcarrysingle - nucleotide p53 mutations that do not result in PTCs and are , thus , not NMD targets . As with other cell lines we examined , 48 hours treatment with NMDI14 alone was minimally toxic ( < 5 % cell death ) in these cell lines . G418 alone showed variable toxicity . However , similar to the p53 wild - type cells andin contrast with those cell lines with NMD - provoking p53 mutations . In no case did the addition of NMDI14 and G418 lead to a synergistic cell death . Discussion We have used a virtual screening strategy to identify small compounds that inhibit NMD . The inhibition of NMD aug - ments the expression of PTC - mutated mRNAs and nonmu - tated mRNAs normally targeted by NMD . Several of these identi ﬁ ed NMDIs , representing diverse chemical backbones , areactiveatthenanomolarlevelevenwithoutfurtherchemical modi ﬁ cation to optimize their solubilities or pharmacokinetic properties . The few pharmacologic inhibitors previously described have been useful in delineating the mechanism of NMD , but either inhibit translation , interfere with mRNA splicing , have not been demonstrated to upregulate enogenous NMD targets , have weak activity , do not synergize with read - through drugs , were identi ﬁ ed through functional screening assays , and / or have unknown mechanisms of action ( 24 , 39 – 41 ) . Therationaldesignofourscreeningmakesitlikelythatour identi ﬁ ed compounds are more speci ﬁ c with less off - target effects than these . Although several of our NMDIs do not seem excessively toxic in a variety of cell lines and have no effect on the expression of mRNAs thatare not targeted by NMD , further work is needed to document and potentially improve the speci ﬁ city , in vivo effectiveness , and off - target toxicity of these lead compounds . Because of the important role NMD plays in degrading many mutated , alternatively spliced , and physiologically expressed mRNAs , even speci ﬁ c inhibition of NMD without any off - target effects might be theorized to be toxic . Indeed , the complete depletion of UPF2 in mice results in nonviability ( 42 ) . However , we and others have demonstrated that the more modest depletionofUPF1andUPF2 , throughshRNA , doesnotadverse - ly affect cell proliferation or survival ( 26 ) . In addition , Figure 5 .

CAN - 13 - 2235 inhibition of NMD by UPF2 deletion in murine hematopoietic cells results only in diminished hematopoietic progenitor cells with almost no effect on differentiated hematopoietic cells ( 42 ) , and widespread constitutive expression of a dominant negative UPF1 only modestly affects the differentiating mouse thymus and spleen ( 43 ) . Although the inhibition of NMD by these stresses normally occurs in growing tumors and in fact is necessary forthe 3Dgrowthofcellsinsoftagarandas explants , the depletion of UPF1 from cells with shRNA does not increase their 3D growth , and , thus , we would not expect inhibition of NMD to necessarily augment tumorigenesis ( 26 ) . The future clinical use of these or other NMDIs , however , will obviously require further studies to determine the short - and long - term effects of potent NMD inhibition . Although NMD requires the pausing of a ribosome at a PTC , the use of the PTC read - through drug Ataluren does not inhibit NMD , potentially because only a small percent - age of mutated mRNAs are read - through by Ataluren . Thus , we have predicted that Ataluren , as well as other strategies , would be more effective in the presence of more substrate mRNA . We have validated this approach by demonstrating that the combination of a read - through drug and NMDI results in the increased protein expression of a PTC - mutated p53 , resulting in improved p53 function . Many genetic dis - orders have mutations that either directly ( nonsense ) or indirectly ( e . g . , splicing mutations , additions or deletions that alter reading frame , alternations in poly - A processing ) can render an mRNA sensitive to NMD . These include cancer ( e . g . , p53 and BRCA1 ) . Because truncated proteins may be able to replicate the function of the full - length protein , may be completely nonfunctional , or may act as dominant nega - tives against the full - normal allele , the effects of inhibiting NMD will have to be carefully considered , particularly with - out a simultaneous consideration of restoring a full - length protein with ribosome read - though . However , based on our data the concomitant pharmacologic inhibition of NMD remains an attractive therapeutic strategy for many genetic diseases , including cancer .
