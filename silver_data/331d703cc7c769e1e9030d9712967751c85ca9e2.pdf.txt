Small - sized inhibitors based on thiodigalactoside ( TDG ) have shown their potential while modi ﬁ cations at their C3 position indicated a strategy to improve selectivity and potency . Considering the role of galectins as glycoprotein tra ﬃ c police , involved in multivalent bridging interactions , we aimed to create multivalent versions of the potent TDG inhibitors . We herein present for the ﬁ rst time the multivalent attachment of a TDG derivative using bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) as the sca ﬀ old . An e ﬃ cient synthetic method is presented to obtain a novel type of neoglycosylated proteins loaded with di ﬀ erent numbers of TDG moieties . A polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) - spacer is introduced between the TDG and the protein sca ﬀ old maintaining appropriate accessibility for an adequate galectin interaction . The novel conjugates were evaluated in galectin binding and inhibition studies in vitro . The conjugate with a moderate density of 19 conjugated TDGs was identi ﬁ ed as one of the most potent multivalent Gal - 3 inhibitors so far , with a clear demonstration of the bene ﬁ t of a multivalent ligand presentation . The described method may facilitate the development of speci ﬁ c galectin inhibitors and their application in biomedical research . A dense layer of carbohydrates is found on mammalian cells , and the variety of the attached glycans results in speci ﬁ c pro ﬁ les for molecular recognition . This recognition involving the so - called “ sugar code ” is operational by reversible interaction of carbohydrate - binding proteins . Members of this protein class are described as lectins and ful ﬁ ll a variety of e ﬀ ector functions in terms of cellular communication . 1 Galectins as one subtype of lectins that can speci ﬁ cally recognize β - galactosides are found in fungi , invertebrates , and vertebrates . 2 Fifteen di ﬀ erent galectins have been identi ﬁ ed in humans until now , and they play crucial roles in the organization of receptor - lectin complexes ( lattices ) 3 , 4 and regulation of immune responses . 5 Their concave - shaped groove for oligosaccharide binding , namely , the carbohydrate recog - nition domain ( CRD ) , is highly preserved . Galectin - 1 ( Gal - 1 ) and galectin - 3 ( Gal - 3 ) are the most thoroughly studied galectins due to their involvement in angiogenesis , tumor progression , and metastasis . 6 − 8 The participation in malignant processes makes them promising targets for anticancer therapy . In this regard , immense e ﬀ orts have been spent on the synthesis of potent and speci ﬁ c ligands . The prevailing majority of drug discovery e ﬀ orts have been focused on the synthetic modi ﬁ cation of lactose ( methyl β - lactoside , K d = 220 μ M for Gal - 3 , K d = 190 μ M for Gal - 1 ) and N - acetyllactosamine ( methyl β - LacNAc , K d = 67 μ M for Gal - 3 ) , which are the natural disaccharide ligands for both Gal - 1 and Gal - 3 . 9 − 11 Thiodigalactosides ( TDG , K d = 49 μ M for Gal - 3 , K d = 24 μ M for Gal - 1 ) were identi ﬁ ed as more potent Gal - 3 inhibitors with additional advantages such as their enhanced glycolytic stability while maintaining a similar binding mode compared to lactose and LacNAc . 12 , 13 Especially , the introduction of triazole moieties at the C3 ′ - position of the galactose molecules resulted in monovalent galectin inhibitors with outstanding high a ﬃ nities showing K d values in the low nanomolar range . 14 − 17 Apart from designing small molecule inhibitors , a multivalency - based strategy was adopted to promote the interactions between ligands and protein , as this more closely mimics the natural way in which galectins interact with glycoproteins .

The most obvious ﬁ nding to emerge from the present study is that the TDG - conjugates exhibit outstanding high inhibitory potencies despite a low or moderate number of attached ligands . Combining a highly potent monovalent ligand with a bene ﬁ cial multivalent presentation resulted in some of the most e ﬀ ective Gal - 3 inhibitors . Besides , the multivalent TDG - conjugates represent the ﬁ rst example of decorating a nonglycosylated carrier with TDG derivatives . ■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Synthesis of a Carboxy - Functionalized Thiodigalacto - side Precursor . The synthesis of a carboxy - functionalized TDG precursor started as shown in Scheme 1 . The key building block was the unsymmetrical thiodigalactoside ( TDG ) precursor 6 carrying phenyltriazole and azide at the 3 - and 3 ′ - positions . To construct TDG precursor 6 , two building blocks , namely , tri - isopropylsilyl thio - glycoside ( compound 4 ) and glycosyl halide ( compound 2 ) , were prepared using a published method of a one - pot desilylation and glycosyl thiol alkylation with glycosyl halide . 28 Hence , compound 1 , prepared from commercially available 1 , 2 , 5 , 6 - diacetone - α - D - glucofurano - side through a known four - step reaction , 29 was converted to 4 . Meanwhile , copper - catalyzed azide − alkyne cycloaddition of compound 1 with phenylacetylene provided the corresponding triazole analog crude , which reacted with HBr to obtain the glycosyl halide compound 2 ( 79 % yield in two steps ) . Desilylating and activating with TBAF turned compound 4 into a thiol nucleophile and thus replaced the anomeric bromide of compound 2 through an SN 2 reaction . Puri ﬁ cation by silica column chromatography gave the resulting compound 5 in 54 % yield . After removing the acetyl protecting group , the resulting crude 6 was used for the next step without further puri ﬁ cation ( Scheme 1 ) . The synthesis of polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) - spacer ( com - pound 7 ) was started from tetraethylene glycol . As previously reported , the reaction of tetraethylene glycol with an equal amount of propargyl bromide in the presence of NaH in THF at room temperature gave the monoalkyne terminated PEG4 . 30 Then the Michael addition of the resulting compound to tert - butyl acrylate in the presence of catalytic sodium metal gave compound 7 in 70 % yield . 31 Having assembled the important intermediates ( compounds 6 and 7 ) , the next objective was their CuAAC conjugation assisted by copper iodide . After puri ﬁ cation with size - exclusion , compound 8 was obtained . Removal of the tert - butyl group from compound 8 gave carboxyl compound 9 ( 90 % yield ) , which was transferred to the corresponding NHS - ester 10 through coupling with TSTU ( Scheme 2 ) . Compound 10 is prone to hydrolysis ( e . g . , during puri ﬁ cation ) ; thus , it was directly used for further reaction . Neo - Glycoprotein Synthesis and Analysis . Compared to click chemistry 32 and squarate linker chemistry , 23 , 24 , 33 − 35 NHS - mediated coupling 25 , 27 , 36 is another straightforward and convenient coupling strategy for the modi ﬁ cation of protein carriers . The lysine residues of bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) react with the NHS ester moiety of the TDG derivative , but a crucial factor that needs to be taken into consideration is the distance between the TDGs and BSA . Bene ﬁ ting from our previous work on chito - oligomer spacers in neo - glycopro - teins , 34 we concluded that a suitable spacer of a certain length would be recommended to maintain an appropriate ligand accessibility and proper galectin interaction of ﬁ nal products . As a logical consequence thereof , a PEG as placeholder with a similar spacing distance was incorporated into conjugation agent 9 . Furthermore , the modi ﬁ cation of carbohydrates or derivatives thereof with PEG as a biocompatible molecule is a commonly used technique . 37 , 38 The NHS functionalized TDG 10 readily reacted with amino groups of BSA using a reaction bu ﬀ er that contained 35 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 0 ) . The total amount of compound 10 was divided into three and added batchwise after every 24 h . As a result , we obtained compound 11 that was veri ﬁ ed by the TNBSA - assay 23 to carry 7 . 0 ± 1 . 0 TDG moieties per BSA molecule ( Scheme 3 ) . The coupling e ﬃ ciency was 7 . 8 % . Shifting the pH to slightly higher values ( pH 8 . 0 − 9 . 0 ) by the addition of triethylamine ( TEA ) gave compound 12 . The TNBSA - assay con ﬁ rmed that the number of attached TDGs was now 18 . 7 ± 1 . 6 corresponding to a coupling e ﬃ ciency of 20 . 1 % . The elevation of the pH may deprotonate the amino groups of lysine residues to a degree su ﬃ ciently high for fast and e ﬃ cient coupling . In accordance with our previous ﬁ ndings , reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) con ﬁ rmed the attachment of TDGs ( Figure S15 , Supporting Information ) .

Multivalent TDG - conjugates 11 and 12 were utilized as immobilized ligands in solid - phase binding assays for recombinant human His 6 - tagged galectin - 1 ( Gal - 1 ) and galectin - 3 ( Gal - 3 ) ( Figure 1 ) . Our binding studies revealed that Gal - 1 bound ligand 11 in a 3 - fold more e ﬃ cient manner than Gal - 3 did . Gal - 1 showed higher a ﬃ nity for conjugate 11 with a 6 - fold reduced apparent dissociation constant K d in comparison with Gal - 3 with p < 0 . 001 ( Student ’ s t test ) . However , Gal - 3 showed an elevated capacity when binding to conjugate 11 , indicated by the higher B max value ( Table 1 ) . This is putatively caused by cluster glycoside e ﬀ ects , 39 which may lead to galectin oligomerization and thus to an increased binding signal ( Figure 1 ) . This e ﬀ ect might be more pronounced for Gal - 3 , which is generally considered to form higher oligomers when binding to multivalent ligands . Gal - 1 aggregation is likely limited to the formation of dimers . Conjugate 12 carries an increasing number of TDG derivatives and was therefore bound with a higher a ﬃ nity and capacity by Gal - 3 . The lower apparent K d value and raised B max value led to the highest binding e ﬃ ciency observed for this binding assay ( Table 1 ) . The enhancement of Gal - 3 binding e ﬃ ciency for compound 12 was signi ﬁ cant with p < 0 . 001 ( Student ’ s t test ) . In contrast , the higher TDG loading of compound 12 did not a ﬀ ect Gal - 1 binding much and the capacity ( B max ) was only slightly increased while the a ﬃ nity was even slightly reduced . The corresponding binding e ﬃ ciencies for Gal - 1 toward conjugates 11 and 12 are similar within experimental error ( Table 1 ) . To summarize these assay results , prototype Gal - 1 and chimera - type Gal - 3 bind compounds 11 and 12 with high a ﬃ nity through recognizing the conjugated TDGs . Our ﬁ ndings corroborate previous studies , which reported on the interaction of both tested galectins with the corresponding monovalent and symmetrical TDG - based compounds by a ﬂ uorescence polar - ization assay . 17 However , we did not detect any speci ﬁ city di ﬀ erences as seen for previously synthesized neo - glycoproteins carrying poly - N - acetyllactosamine ( poly - LacNAc ) derivatives . 24 Scheme 2 .

In this context , multivalency could greatly maintain an outstanding strong Gal - 3 interaction . Neo - Glycoproteins Acting as Gal - 3 Inhibitors . The univalent TDG derivative 9 and multivalent glycoconjugates 11 and 12 were evaluated in terms of their capability to block the binding of Gal - 3 to immobilized asialofetuin ( ASF ) . The ASF glycoprotein is used as a standard galectin ligand as reported before . 23 , 24 , 34 , 42 , 43 Gal - 3 was incubated together with increasing amounts of inhibitors 9 , 11 , or 12 aiming at a complete prevention of ASF − galectin interaction . Nonmodi ﬁ ed BSA was utilized as negative control and con ﬁ rmed to be not interfering with Gal - 3 binding to ASF . Hence , we conclude that the observed inhibition phenomena were only due to the TDG cargo of compounds 11 and 12 . As depicted by Figure 2 , a complete inhibition of Gal - 3 binding to ASF was reached when using inhibitor 9 ( > 25 μ M ) and conjugates 11 and 12 ( > 200 nM ) . The resulting sigmoidal inhibition curves were the basis for the calculation of the IC 50 value , de ﬁ ned as the inhibitor concentration at which half - maximal inhibition was reached ( Table 2 ) . The inhibition strength of compound 9 was in the low micromolar range and ﬁ ts the range of N ′ , N ″ - diacetyllactosamine ( LacdiNAc ) - LacNAc tetrasaccharide , which was identi ﬁ ed as a speci ﬁ c ligand of Gal - 3 . 23 However , we assume that the NHS - / PEG - modi ﬁ cation of one C3 atom Scheme 3 .

When comparing previous relevant studies , it becomes clear that Gal - 3 has a much higher a ﬃ nity for the symmetrically modi ﬁ ed TDG . When both of TDG ’ s galactose moieties carry selected substituents such as C ( 3 ) - benzamides 16 , 41 or C ( 3 ) - tria - zoles , 14 , 17 the Gal - 3 a ﬃ nity is optimal showing apparent K d values between 22 and 360 nM in a ﬂ uorescence polarization assay . Nevertheless , the conjugation of TDG derivative 9 to nonglycosylated serum protein sca ﬀ old gave conjugates 11 and 12 . Their use as inhibitors of Gal - 3 binding resulted in extraordinarily high inhibitory potencies and low IC 50 values ( Table 2 ) . Even though the cargo of compound 11 was only a quantity of seven TDG derivatives , the inhibition strength was increased 465 - fold compared to univalent compound 9 . This corresponds to an improvement factor of 66 per loaded TDG . The impact of the multivalent ligand presentation was even more pronounced for glycoconjugate 12 presenting a higher number ( n = 18 . 7 ) of TDG derivatives . Here , the determined IC 50 value is reduced by more than 4800 - fold compared with that of compound 9 , representing an improvement factor per TDG of 256 . Our ﬁ ndings suggest that multivalent conjugates 11 and 12 , but not monovalent compound 9 , inactivate more Gal - 3 molecules than the amount of presented TDG derivatives , as seen before . 22 On the one hand , both multivalent inhibitors may induce the formation of Gal - 3 complexes , cross - linked by their N - termini . 44 On the other hand , type - C Gal - 3 self - association is most likely . Here , the nonoccupied CRD of Gal - 3 molecules interact with already TDG - bound Gal - 3 leading to an oligomerization and stacking as reported before . 45 To the best of our knowledge , the tremendously diminished IC 50 value makes multivalent glycoconjugate 12 one of the most e ﬀ ective Gal - 3 inhibitors . The multivalent design promotes the cluster glycoside e ﬀ ect resulting in a highly e ﬃ cient entrapment of Gal - 3 . 1 , 39 , 46 Neo - glycoproteins with a cargo of di ﬀ erent poly - LacNAc derivatives were recently synthesized and applied as Gal - 3 inhibitors . 23 Thus , we may use them as a reference to evaluate the presented results . In particular , those BSA neo - glycoconju - gates bearing the LacNAc - LacNAc ( n = 7 . 5 ) or LacdiNAc - LacNAc ( n = 7 . 4 ) glycans are ideal benchmarks because of an equal modi ﬁ cation density with regard to conjugate 11 . In that case only moderate inhibition strengths were observed , with IC 50 values of 850 nM ( [ LacNAc - LacNAc ] n = 7 . 4 - BSA ) and 1100 nM ( [ LacdiNAc - LacNAc ] n = 7 . 4 - BSA ) , respectively . 23 Clearly the TDG ligand has a potency advantage but the implementation of the PEG - spacer may also be a favorable feature in terms of ligand accessibility and ﬂ exibility . 38 , 47 To evaluate conjugate 12 , previously synthesized neo - glycoproteins were used as ideal references again . Conjugates with LacNAc - LacNAc ( n = 17 . 8 ) , LacdiNAc - LacNAc ( n = 18 . 0 ) , 23 or derivatized poly - LacNAc hexasaccharides of equal modi ﬁ cation density ( n = 16 − 19 ) 24 were prepared and thoroughly studied in terms of galectin interaction . The respective inhibition constants ranged between 60 and 90 nM 23 and 37 and 76 nM . 24 Based on the outstanding low IC 50 ( 1 . 88 nM ) , the potency of conjugate 12 is at least more than 20 - fold elevated in comparison with the most potent reference neo - glycoproteins . TDG derivatives have been validated to be valuable inhibitors for galectin research . The aromatic groups on the C3 and C3 ′ positions of TDG tune galectin selectivity and a ﬃ nity . We herein report on the synthesis of an asymmetrical TDG structure that can be used to yield multivalent compounds through conjugating to a protein sca ﬀ old . To obtain the key precursor , a straightforward approach was used to lead to the NHS functionalized - TDG derivative . Subsequent reaction with BSA gave multivalent TDG - glycoconjugates . Weak alkaline pH , adjusted by TEA , was crucial for an e ﬀ ective conjugation . To the best of our knowledge , this is the ﬁ rst example of conjugating a TDG derivative to a nonglycosylated carrier . The multivalent presentation on conjugates 11 and 12 unlocks TDG ’ s full potential . Extraordinarily high multivalency factors were obvious that resulted in one of the most e ﬀ ective inhibition of Gal - 3 in vitro until now . The result is clearly a combination of the binding properties of the monovalent ligand and the multivalent display by the BSA . As previously noted , potent galectin inhibition cannot be achieved with very weak or nonbinding ligands , conjugated to BSA . 34 Furthermore , we note that , while a multivalent sca ﬀ old can enhance existing binding potency , the speci ﬁ city at the multivalent level remains the same . 48 In other systems , very strong multivalency e ﬀ ects have been reported leading to picomolar inhibition , usually involving the simultaneous binding of ligands to nearby binding sites . 49 This chelation type mechanism is less likely to contribute to the present system , due to the monovalent nature of the nonaggregated protein . Considering this , other modes of action such as statistical rebinding or aggregation usually lead to smaller e ﬀ ects , 46 which makes the present results more notable . Furthermore , this work shows that the multivalent inhibitor is able to inhibit far more Gal - 3 molecules than its number of attached ligands . This feature is a likely consequence of aggregation phenomena , blocking Gal - 3 binding sites , previously observed for Gal - 3 and named type - C - self - association . 45 Systems such as the present , capable of nucleating the process , may lead us to a full understanding of this phenomenon . In the present system , the PEG - spacer likely helps to make the TDGs accessible for the interacting galectins . The multivalent TDG - modi ﬁ ed conjugates ( 11 , 12 ) have the ideal properties for a putative biomedical application because of ( i ) the serum protein sca ﬀ old has the approved quality to be applied to the bloodstream ; ( ii ) the PEG - spacer is biocompat - ible , sustained , and safe ; and ( iii ) the TDG derivative is considered chemically stable . Hence , cell culture in vitro experiments ( inhibition of Gal - 3 induced angiogenesis ) are planned in the due course in order to elucidate the power of the synthesized conjugate . In vivo applications may follow . The conjugation of TDGs with di ﬀ erent functional groups on C3 and C3 ′ position ( e . g . , 4 - phenoxyphenyl ) are planned to Table 2 .

The resulting mixture was stirred for 30 min , and then TLC and HPLC showed that the starting material was fully converted . To avoid hydrolysis , the crude 10 was used for labeling the protein directly . Preparation of Multivalent TDG - Conjugates 11 and 12 . A volume of 150 μ L BSA ( 60 μ M in 35 mM HEPES bu ﬀ er , pH 7 . 0 ) was mixed with 5 μ L of the coupling agent ( compound 10 crude , 54 mM in DMF ) was added into the solution and the reaction mixture was incubated at 4 ° C . After 24 and 48 h , additional volumes of 5 μ L compound 10 crude were added . As to synthesis of conjugate 12 , the pH of the BSA solution was elevated to pH 9 . 0 using TEA before adding the conjugation agent . Conjugates 11 and 12 were isolated and rinsed with H 2 O using VivaSpin 500 centrifugal concentrators ( Sartorius Stedim Biotech , Goettingen , Germany ) with an MWCO of 10 kDa . The protein concentration was determined by Bradford reagent ( Carl Roth , Karlsruhe , Germany ) according to manufacturer ’ s instruction . Galectin Preparation . Constructs for human His 6 - tagged galectin - 1 ( Gal - 1 ) and His 6 - tagged galectin - 3 ( Gal - 3 ) were used from previous investigations . With regard to galectin - 1 , the full - length sequence was cloned into His 6 - tag providing pETDuet - 1 ( Novagen , Darmstadt , Germany ) using restriction sites Bam HI and SgsI , followed by the introduction of the C2S mutation to increase construct stability . 50 The full - length sequence of galectin - 3 was cloned into pETDuet - 1 ( Novagen , Darmstadt , Germany ) using restriction sites SgsI and Eco RI . 42 The expression of both galectins was performed in recombinant E . coli Rosetta ( DE3 ) pLysS cells , which were cultivated in 1 L TB medium ( 5 L ba ﬄ ed ﬂ ask ) containing appropriate antibiotics ( 80 rpm , 100 μ g / mL ampicillin , 34 μ g / mL chloramphenicol ) . After an optical density ( OD 600 nm ) of 0 . 5 − 0 . 8 was reached the temperature was decreased from 37 to 25 ° C and isopropyl - 1 - thio - β - D - galactopyranoside ( IPTG , 0 . 5 mM ) was added for inducing protein expression . After 24 h post - induction , the cells were harvested by centrifugation ( 7000 rpm , 30 min , 4 ° C ) and stored at − 20 ° C . With regard to galectin puri ﬁ cation , bacteria were suspended in lysis bu ﬀ er ( 50 mM HEPES , 500 mM NaCl , 20 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 5 ) and sonicated on ice ( two cycles , 30 s each ) . After removal of cell debris by centrifugation ( 15 000 rpm , 30 min , 4 ° C ) , supernatant was ﬁ ltered through 0 . 8 μ m syringe ﬁ lter . HisTrap HP 5 mL columns were used ( GE Healthcare ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions for galectin enrichment . Elution of His 6 - tagged galectins was achieved by augmenting the imidazole concentration in one step to 500 mM . Isolated galectins were dialyzed against phosphate bu ﬀ ered saline ( PBS , 50 mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 150 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 5 ) supplemented with 2 mM ethylenediaminetetra - acetic acid ( EPBS ) using SnakeSkin Dialysis Tubing ( 10 kDa MWCO , ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁ c ) . Durability of Gal - 1 was increased by supplementing storage bu ﬀ er with 20 % ( v / v ) glycerol . Galectin Binding In Vitro . F16 Maxisorp NUNC - Immuno Modules ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c , Roskilde , Denmark ) were immobilized with appropriate amounts of 11 , 12 , or non - modi ﬁ ed BSA ( 0 . 1 μ M in PBS , 50 μ L , 5 pmol per well , 18 h ) . Immobilization and all further steps were performed at room temperature . After three washing steps using PBS supple - mented with 0 . 05 % ( v / v ) Tween 20 ( PBST ) , residual unoccupied binding sites were blocked with PBS containing 2 % ( w / v ) BSA . An additional 3 - fold PBST washing step followed . Gal - 1 and Gal - 3 were added at di ﬀ erent concen - trations ( 1 5000 nM , 50 μ L , 1 h ) . An additional 3 - fold PBST washing step followed . The addition of peroxidase conjugated anti - His 6 - IgG2a from mouse ( Roche Diagnostics , 1 : 4000 in Bioconjugate Chemistry Article DOI : 10 . 1021 / acs . bioconjchem . 8b00047 Bioconjugate Chem . 2018 , 29 , 1266 − 1275 1272 PBS , 50 μ L , 12 . 5 mU / mL , 1 h ) enabled the detection of His 6 - tagged galectins . An additional 3 - fold PBST washing step followed . Reaction of IgG - conjugated peroxidase was initiated by addition of 3 , 3 ′ 5 , 5 ′ - tetramethylbenzidine ( TMB ) One ( Kem - En - Tec , Taastrup , Denmark ) substrate solution ( 50 μ L ) . The reaction was stopped by addition of 3 M HCl ( 50 μ L ) . Spectra Max Plus ( Molecular Devices , Biberach , Germany ) plate reader was utilized to measure the optical density at 450 nm , which is a measure for galectin binding . Blank values ( no Gal - 1 and / or Gal - 3 ) were subtracted from all measurement values . SigmaPlot 10 was used to match the data points by nonlinear regression and to extract the respective kinetic parameters ( eq 1 ) . = · + Y B X K X max d ( 1 ) where Y is binding signal ; B max is maximal binding signal ; X is galectin concentration ; K d is half - maximal apparent a ﬃ nity constant [ nM ] . Galectin Inhibition In Vitro . F16 Maxisorp NUNC - Immuno Modules ( Thermo Scienti ﬁ c , Roskilde , Denmark ) were immobilized with appropriate amounts of asialofetuin as standard glycoprotein ligand ( 0 . 1 μ M in PBS , 50 μ L , 5 pmol per well , 18 h ) . Immobilization and all further steps were performed at room temperature . After three washing steps using PBS supplemented with 0 . 05 % ( v / v ) Tween 20 ( PBST ) , residual unoccupied binding sites were blocked with PBS containing 2 % ( w / v ) BSA . An additional 3 - fold PBST washing step followed . As a next step , monovalent inhibitor 9 and multivalent inhibitors 11 and 12 ( 5 μ L each ) of di ﬀ erent concentration were given in the wells and Gal - 3 ( 45 μ L , 5 . 56 μ M ) was added for 1 h . Signals for Gal - 3 binding to ASF decreased as more inhibitor was present . Blank values ( no Gal - 3 ) were subtracted from all measurement values showing that almost complete inhibition of Gal - 3 molecules was reached .
