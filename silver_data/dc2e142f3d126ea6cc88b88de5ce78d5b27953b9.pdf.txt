By conventional electron microscopy and serial sectioning , we observed a category of double - walled vesicles at the axonal – myelin sheath interface , which often contained ribosome - like particles or endoplasmic reticulum . Some of them were demonstrated to continue with the subjacent axon with a thin stalk . In addition , we described a special category of axonal invaginations , probably mediated by subsurface cisternae . The functional implications of these specialized structures were discussed . # 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society . All rights reserved .

Introduction Vertebrate myelinated axons consist of several distinct membrane regions , such as compact myelin , periaxolem - mal – myelin and the axolemma , and there may be an intercellular macromolecular trafﬁc at the axonal – myelin interface ( Alvarez et al . , 2000 ) . A number of authors have described a category of double - walled vesicles in the axons , which enclosed cytoplasm and / or plasmalemma from an adjacent cell . They might be formed by axonal invagina - tions , and involved in cellular interchange by bulk transfer of material ( Eckenhoff and Pysh , 1979 ; Waxman and Pappas , 1980 ; Novotny , 1984 ; Eddleman et al . , 1998 ) . As opposed to the peripheral myelinated axons , there are special structural complexities at the axonal – myelin sheath interface of central internodes . The glial cytoplasm on the inside of central myelin sheaths does not form a complete layer , but instead it may be conﬁned to a small part of the circumference on each side of the internal mesaxon ( Peters et al . , 1991 ) . This small region of oligodendritic cytoplasm contains various organelles such as ribosomes , mitochondria and endoplasm reticulum ( ER ) , thus an active intercellular exchange could be expected to occur in such regions . In order to search for such morphological clues , we followed the ﬁrst central internode of spinal motor axons by conventional electron microscopy and serial sectioning to study the axonal – myelin sheath interface . 2 . Materials and methods The material for this study was collected from an earlier work ( Li et al . , 2005 ) . Specimens were taken from spinal cervical enlargement of sixteen 2 – 3 - month - old chickens ( Gallus domesticus , weighing 1 – 2 kg ) , which were ﬁxed through the heart with 1 % paraformaldehyde and 1 . 25 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) .
