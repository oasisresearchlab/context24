The MotPS complex is activated in response to an increase in the Na + concentration in the environment , but the mechanism of this activation has remained unknown . We report that activation occurs by a Na + - induced folding and dimer formation of the PGB domain of MotS , as revealed in real - time imaging by high - speed atomic force microscopy . The MotPS complex showed two distinct ellipsoid domains connected by a flexible linker . A smaller domain , corresponding to the PGB domain , became structured and unstructured in the presence and absence of 150 mM NaCl , respectively . When the amino - terminal portion of the PGB domain adopted a partially stretched conformation in the presence of NaCl , the center - to - center distance between these two domains increased by up to 5 nm , allowing the PGB domain to reach and bind to the peptidoglycan layer . We propose that assembly of the MotPS complex into a motor proceeds by means of Na + - induced structural transitions of its PGB domain . INTRODUCTION Intrinsically disordered ( ID ) proteins adopt an ensemble of conforma - tions to permit rapid but specific interactions of the proteins with their binding partners to modulate their biological activities . The conforma - tional flexibilities of ID motifs in proteins regulate a variety of biological activities by folding and / or binding to numerous cellular partners in a highly cooperative manner ( 1 , 2 ) . The bacterial flagellum is a supramolecular motility machinery con - sisting of at least three parts : the basal body as a rotary motor , the hook as a universal joint , and the filament as a helical screw . The flagellar mo - tor consists of a rotor and a dozen stator units ( Fig . 1A ) and is driven by ion - motive force across the cytoplasmic membrane . The flagellar motor also acts as a biosensor to respond to changes in the environment , inducing developmental changes such as cell differentiation and bio - film formation in planktonic cells for their survival . The stator unit is a transmembrane ( TM ) ion channel and couples ion flow through the channel with torque generation . It has been shown that the ion channel activity of the stator unit is linked with cell differentiation ( 3 – 5 ) . The stator units show rapid exchange between the motor and the cyto - plasmic pool while the motor is spinning . Furthermore , each stator unit associates with and dissociates from the motor in response to changes in the environment as well as load . These observations suggest that the stator unit acts as a molecular sensor to detect changes in the en - vironment to regulate the number of active stator units in the motor ( 6 – 10 ) . The stator unit of the H + - driven motor consists of four copies of MotA and two copies of MotB ( 11 ) . A specific interaction between MotA and the rotor protein FliG is required not only for motor rotation but also for efficient stator assembly around the rotor ( 12 – 14 ) . MotA has four TM helices ( TM1 to TM4 ) , and MotB has a single TM helix . The TM3 and TM4 helices of MotA form a proton channel with MotB - TM ( 15 ) . Asp 33 of Salmonella MotB , which is a highly conserved aspartic residue among MotB orthologs , is located at the cytoplasmic end of MotB - TM ( Fig . 1B ) and is responsible for proton translocation through the channel in a load - dependent manner ( 16 ) . MotB also has a large C - terminal periplasmic domain ( MotB C ) , which consists of a flexiblestalk ( residues51to100 ) anda compactlyfoldedpeptidoglycan - binding ( PGB ) domain ( residues 101 to 309 ) responsible for the asso - ciation with the peptidoglycan layer . The stalk , which is predicted to be ID ( fig . S1A ) , not only suppresses the proton channel activity before stator assembly around the rotor ( 17 , 18 ) but also regulates theassembly and disassembly dynamics of the stator unit in response to the environmental changes ( 9 ) , although not essential for the torque gener - ation mechanism in Salmonella enterica ( 19 ) . The Bacillus subtilis flagellar motor has two distinct types of stator units : H + - type MotAB and Na + - type MotPS ( 20 , 21 ) . MotP and MotS together form a Na + channel in a manner similar to the MotAB proton channel , and the MotPS complex acts as a Na + sensor to regulate its assembly into and disassembly from the motor ( 10 , 20 , 21 ) . However , the mechanism remains unknown . Here , we used high - speed atomic force microscopy ( HS - AFM ) combined with mutational analysis and obtained structural insights into the assembly and activation mecha - nism of the Na + - type MotPS stator unit . RESULTS Effect of Na + ions on the torque - speed relationship of the B . subtilis wild - type flagellar motor Precise analyses of the torque versus speed relationship of the flagellar motor provide insights into the torque generation mechanism of the flagellar motor ( 3 ) . It has been shown that the torque - speed curve of the MotPS motor is distinct from that of the MotAB motor ( fig . S2A , blue and magenta lines ) ( 10 ) . A single MotPS stator unit produces the same torque as a single MotAB stator unit when operating at high load 1 Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences , Osaka University , 1 - 3 Yamadaoka , Suita , Osaka 565 - 0871 , Japan . 2 Bio - AFM Frontier Research Center , Kanazawa University , Kanazawa 920 - 1192 , Japan . 3 Department of Physics , Kanazawa University , Kanazawa 920 - 1192 , Japan . 4 Department of Physics , Nagoya University , Chikusa - ku , Nagoya 464 - 8602 , Japan . 5 CoreResearchforEvolutionalScienceandTechnology , JapanScience and Technology Agency , Goban - cho , Chiyoda - ku , Tokyo 102 - 0076 , Japan . 6 Quantita - tive Biology Center , RIKEN , 1 - 3 Yamadaoka , Suita , Osaka 565 - 0871 , Japan . * Corresponding author .

Adv . 2017 ; 3 : eaao4119 1 November 2017 1 of 9 ( 10 ) . However , the maximum rotational speed of the MotPS motor is about four times slower than that of the MotAB motor when operating at low load ( 10 ) . To understand the Na + - sensing mechanism of the MotPS complex , we first characterized the torque - speed relationship of the B . subtilis wild - type motor over a wide range of Na + concentra - tions by bead assays ( fig . S2A and table S1 ) . The maximum speed of the wild - type motor was decreased from ca . 200 to 80 Hz when the external Na + concentration was increased from 0 to 200 mM , although the stall torque was not changed at all . It has been shown that only one MotPS stator unit can be installed into the motor under these experimental conditions ( 10 ) . Because the stall torque produced by the motor is dependent on the number of active stator units around a rotor ( 3 , 4 ) , this result suggests that the wild - type motor contains both H + - type MotAB and Na + - type MotPS stator units in the presence of NaCl . To clarify whether the wild - type motor shows rapid stator exchange in a Na + - dependent manner , we carried out buffer exchange exper - iments ( fig . S2B and table S2 ) . To quantitatively evaluate the speed sta - bility of flagellar motor rotation , we calculated the average speed ( w av ) and the SD of w ( s w ) . The wild - type motor with a 0 . 8 - m m bead attached rotated at an average speed of 83 . 8 Hz with an SD of 7 . 5 Hz in a buffer containing 200 mM KCl . The speed fluctuation , evaluated as the val - ue of s w / w av , was 0 . 09 . Upon exchanging the buffer to that contain - ing 200 mM NaCl , the rotation rate of the wild - type motor with the 0 . 8 - m m bead attached was decreased to an average speed of 65 . 8 Hz with an SD of 19 . 5 ( s w / w av = 0 . 3 ) . When the buffer was exchanged back to the one containing 200 mM KCl , the motor rotated stably at the original level again ( s w / w av = 0 . 09 ) . The rotation rate of the MotAB motor was stable in the presence and absence of 200 mM NaCl , whereas the MotPS motor rotated at an average speed of 9 . 8 Hz with an SD of 2 . 3 Hz only in the presence of 200 mM NaCl . These results indicate that the assembly and disassembly of the MotPS complex rapidly oc - cur in a Na + - dependent manner . Molecular shape of the MotPS complex in the presence and absence of Na + ions MotP and MotS together form a Na + channel complex with four copies of MotP and two copies of MotS in a manner similar to the MotA 4 B 2 proton channel complex ( Fig . 2A ) . The C - terminal periplasmic domain of MotS ( MotS C ) , which has a putative plug segment and a PGB motif ( Fig . 2B ) , is postulated to act as a Na + sensor ( 10 ) . To clarify how it sensesNa + , wepurifiedtheMotP 4 S 2 complex , ofwhichTM heliceswere covered by amphipol to make the TM domain stably solubilized in so - lution ( fig . S3 ) , and analyzed its structural dynamics by HS - AFM in a buffer solution with or without Na + ions . HS - AFM is capable of not only visualizing conformational dynamics of protein complexes at a high spatiotemporal resolution ( 22 , 23 ) but also observing the status of ID regions of proteins ( 24 ) . Purified MotPS complex was visualized as two ellipsoid domains connected by a flexible linker ( Fig . 2C and movies S1 and S2 ) . The molecular shape of the small domain in the experimental AFM images was almost the same as that of a simulated image constructed from the crystal structure of the MotB C dimer [ Pro - tein Data Bank ( PDB ) code : 2ZVY ] ( fig . S4 ) ( 19 ) . To confirm this , we constructed the MotPS D peri complex generated by a deletion of MotS C ( Fig . 2B ) and found that it did not have the small domain ( Fig . 2C and movieS3 ) , leadingtoa conclusionthatthesmalldomaincorresponds to the MotS C dimer . Because the molecular shape of the large domain looked similar to that of a simulated model image constructed from the three - dimensional ( 3D ) density map of the MotA tetramer recon - structed from negatively stained electron microscopy images ( fig . S4 ) ( 25 ) , we suggest that the large domain corresponds to the MotP tetra - mer in complex with the MotS - TM dimer . About 86 % of the particles adopted the two - domain structure in the presence of 150 mM NaCl ( n = 102 ) . In the remaining 14 % of the par - ticles , two filamentous structures were seen to be attached to the large domain , indicating that MotS C was disordered . In the absence of NaCl , only 25 % of the particles took the two - domain feature , and MotS C adopted unfolded conformations in 75 % of the particles ( n = 104 ) . The buffer containing 150 mM KCl did not affect the folding of MotS C at all ( n = 103 ) ( fig . S5 , A and B ) . These observations raise the possibility that Na + ions directly stabilize the folded MotS C structure . To clarify this , we replaced the PGB domain of MotS by that of MotB to generate MotPS B - PGB ( Fig . 2B ) and carried out HS - AFM imaging ( Fig . 2C and movie S4 ) . The structural stability of the PGB domain of MotPS B - PGB was not affected by depletion of NaCl ( fig . S5B ) . These results suggest that Na + acts as a structural stabilizer to maintain the folded conforma - tion of the PGB domain of MotS C . Real - time imaging of Na + - induced structural transitions of MotS C We next investigated whether the structural transitions of the MotS C dimer between the unfolded and folded states are reversible ( movies S5 and S6 ) . When MotPS was exposed to a buffer with 150 mM KCl , MotS C was unfolded in solution . Upon gradually exchanging the buffer to the one containing 150 mM NaCl , thereby increasing the Na + con - centration up to 150 mM ( fig . S5C ) , MotS C became suddenly structured with a transition time within 1 s ( Fig . 3A , second and third panels ) . When the Na + concentration was reduced back to zero again ( fig . S5D ) , the folded MotS C dimer also became suddenly unstructured with a transition time within 1 s ( Fig . 3B , second and third panels ) . Because the temporal resolution of the present HS - AFM imaging was 250 ms per frame , it was not possible to estimate the rate constant for the folding and unfolding transitions . However , we obtained the Michaelis Fig . 1 . Schematicdrawingofthebacterialflagellarmotor . ( A ) Schematicdiagram oftheflagellarmotor .

These results in - dicate that Na + ions directly induce the disorder - to - order transition of MotS C , facilitating its dimerization to form the PGB domain in a highly cooperative manner . Therefore , we propose that Na + ions induce the structuralswitchingof the MotS C dimer from theunfolded to the folded states , thereby facilitating MotPS assembly into a motor to act as an active Na + - type stator unit . Effect of an in - frame deletion of residues 48 to 77 of MotS on Na + - induced structural transitions of MotS C ID regions in proteins are known to modulate their biological activities along with their binding partners ( 1 , 2 ) .

Adv . 2017 ; 3 : eaao4119 1 November 2017 3 of 9 which form a putative motif termed a plug segment ( 17 ) , are predicted to be ID , as judged by the predictor of naturally disordered regions ( PONDR ) program ( fig . S1B ) . To examine whether the plug segment contributes to the Na + - induced structural transitions of MotS C , we con - structed MotPS D plug lacking residues 48 to 77 of MotS ( Fig . 2B ) and carried out its HS - AFM imaging ( movie S7 ) . The deletion of residues 48to77inMotScausedaloss - of - functionphenotype ( fig . S6 ) , indicating that the plug segment of MotS C is essential for motor function . The MotPS D plug complex observed by HS - AFM showed the two ellipsoid do - mains , but the flexible linker connecting these two domains was missing ( Fig . 2C ) . The population of particles with the unfolded PGB domain was increased to about 80 % when the salt in the buffer was exchanged from 150 mM NaCl to 150 mM KCl ( fig . S5B ) . This indicates that the PGB domain of MotS C itself contains a Na + - induced structural switch . Effect of the MotS D30A mutation on Na + - induced structural transitions of MotS C A highly conserved Asp 24 residue of Vibrio alginolyticus PomB , which corresponds to Asp 30 of B . subtilis MotS - TM , is a Na + - binding site ( 26 ) and is responsible for the Na + - dependent assembly and disassembly of the PomAB complex ( 27 ) , which acts as a Na + - type stator unit of ma - rine Vibrio ( fig . S1C ) . Therefore , we tested whether the replacement of Asp 30 ofMotSbyalanineaffectsthestructuraltransitionsofMotS C . The D30A substitution inhibited motility in soft agar ( fig . S6 ) , in agreement with a previous report ( 28 ) . MotPS D30A observed by HS - AFM looked very similar in its entire architecture to wild - type MotPS ( Fig . 2C and movie S8 ) . Replacement of NaCl by KCl in the buffer still significantly increased the population of an unfolded conformation of MotS C from ca . 18to89 % ( fig . S5B ) , indicatingthatitisnotthebindingofNa + toAsp 30 of MotS that induces the disorder - to - order transition of MotS C . Con - sistently , the D30A mutation affected neither the K m value of MotS C for Na + nor the Hill ’ s cooperativity coefficient ( Fig . 3C ) . Therefore , we conclude that Asp 30 of MotS is not directly involved in the Na + - induced structural transition of MotS C . Structural stability of folded MotS C in the presence of Na + ions Structure - based functional analyses of MotB C and PomB C led to a pro - posal that drastic conformational changes of the N - terminal portion of the PGB domains of MotB C and PomB C are required not only for the bindingoftheirPGB domains tothe peptidoglycanlayer butalso forthe ion channel formation upon MotAB and PomAB stator assembly into the flagellar motor , because the distance between the periplasmic sur - face of the cytoplasmic membrane and the inner surface of the peptido - glycan layer is about 10 nm , which is too far to reach for their PGB domains with only 5 nm in height above the TM domain ( 19 , 29 ) . To see whether the 5 - nm extension of the PGB domain required for its binding to the peptidoglycan layer occurs in action , we analyzed the correlation between the center - to - center distance and the heights of these two ellipsoid domains of wild - type MotPS in HS - AFM images ( Fig . 4A ) . The center - to - center distance between these two domains varied within a short time scale . The histogram of the center - to - center distanceshowedabroaddistributionthatcanbefittedwiththreeGaussian peaks at 10 . 1 , 12 . 5 , and 15 . 4 nm , although these peaks do not seem to be meaningful . The image height of the small domain corresponding to MotS C decreased as the distance between these two domains increased , whereas the image height of the large domain did not change at all ( Fig . 4B ) . The histogram of the height of MotS C showed two dis - tinct peaks at 4 . 1 and 3 . 2 nm ( Fig . 4B ) . Because the accuracy of our HS - AFM measurements is estimated to be about 1 nm for the distance Fig . 3 . Na + - inducedstructuraltransitionsoftheMotS C dimer .

Adv . 2017 ; 3 : eaao4119 1 November 2017 4 of 9 between the two objects and 0 . 15 nm for the height ( 30 ) , we suggest that the N - terminal portion of MotS C is less stable and easy to unfold , allowing the PGB domain of MotS C to extend from the large domain by about 5 nm . We found that residues 48 to 77 of MotS C correspond to the flexible linkerconnectingthetwodistinctdomainsofMotPS ( Fig . 2 ) . Therefore , we next tested whether the plug segment contributes to the 5 - nm extension of its PGB domain from the large domain . The center - to - center distance between these two domains of MotPS D plug also changed within a short time scale ( Fig . 4C ) . In contrast to the wild type , the his - togram of the center - to - center distance of MotPS D plug showed two dis - tinct peaks at 10 . 3 and 13 . 0 nm . The height of MotS C decreased as the distance between these two domains increased , whereas the height of the large domain did not change at all ( Fig . 4D ) in a manner similar to that of the wild type ( Fig . 4B ) . This indicates that the N - terminal por - tion of the PGB domain of MotS C is less stable and becomes easily un - structured . Consistently , the N - terminal potion of the PGB domain is predicted to have a flexible conformation ( fig . S1B ) . Therefore , we sug - gest thatresidues 48 to 77 of MotS C form a flexible string responsible for an approximately 2 . 5 - nm distance of the PGB domain from the large domain and that the N - terminal portion of the PGB domain can adopt a stretched conformation , causing a further roughly 2 . 5 - nm extension from 13 . 0 to 15 . 4 nm . Because the deletion of residues 48 to 77 caused loss of function ( fig . S6 ) , we propose that conformational fluctuations of the plug segment in MotS C allow the PGB domain to reach and bind to the peptidoglycan layer . Fig . 4 .

Adv . 2017 ; 3 : eaao4119 1 November 2017 5 of 9 A highly conserved Asp 30 residue of MotS - TM is postulated to be in - volved in the Na + flow through the Na + channel formed by MotP - TM3 , MotP - TM4 , and MotS - TM helices in a manner similar to Asp 33 residue of Salmonella MotB - TM ( 4 ) . The plug segment coordinates the ion channel activity with stator assembly into the motor ( 17 ) , raising the pos - sibility that the D30A mutation may also affect the extension and con - traction processes of MotS C . To test this , we analyzed the correlation between the center - to - center distance between the small and large do - mains of MotPS D30A and their heights ( Fig . 4E ) . Similar to the wild type , the distance distribution of MotPS D30A clearly showed three distinct peaks at 10 . 6 , 13 . 0 , and 15 . 6 nm ( Fig . 4F ) . However , the height of the MotS C domain did not change when the distance was increased from 10 . 6 to 13 . 0 nm , indicating that the 2 . 4 - nm extension between the two domains is a consequence of the dissociation of the MotS C plug segment from the TM domain ( Fig . 4F ) . When the center - to - center distance was increased from 13 . 0 to 15 . 6 nm , the height of the MotS C domain de - creased from 4 . 2 to 3 . 2 nm ( Fig . 4F ) . Wild - type MotPS did not show this two - step extension so clearly , raising the possibility that the D30A muta - tion reduces the rate of extension and contraction processes of MotS C . Therefore , we propose that the binding of Na + to Asp 30 in MotS - TM may regulate the rates of detachment , following conformational dynam - ics of the plug segment of MotS C . DISCUSSION The assembly of Na + - type stator units into the flagellar motor is affected by changes in the external Na + concentration . This suggests that the Na + - type stator unit acts as a Na + sensor that regulates the number of active stator units in the motor in response to the external Na + concen - tration ( 27 , 31 – 33 ) . Wild - type B . subtilis hastwodistincttypesofstators : H + - type MotAB and Na + - type MotPS complexes ( 20 , 21 ) . When the PGB domain of MotB of B . subtilis is replaced by that of MotS , the chi - meric motor shows the same torque - speed curve as the MotAB motor inthepresenceofNa + ions . Incontrast , thestall torqueproduced bythis chimeric motor decreases significantly in the absence of NaCl ( 10 ) . Be - cause the stall torque is proportional to the number of active stator units in the motor ( 3 , 4 ) , it has been proposed that the PGB domain of MotS has the Na + - binding site to stabilize its association with the peptido - glycan layer ( 10 ) . Here , we showed real - time observations of the Na + - induced folding and dimerization of the PGB domain of MotS C ( Fig . 3 ) and dynamic changes in the distance between this PGB domain and the TM domain of MotPS connected by a flexible linker ( Fig . 4 ) . Because an about 5 - nm extension of the PGB domain of MotS C from the TM domain allows the MotPS complex to reach and be anchored to the peptidoglycan layer to act as an active Na + - type stator unit , we suggest that the PGB domain of MotS C acts as a Na + sensor to regulate the activation and assembly of the MotPS complex into the motor through its Na + - induced structural transition between the unfolded and folded states . On the basis of the available information , we propose the following mechanism for assembly and activation of the Na + - type MotPS stator unit ( Fig . 5 ) . In the absence of Na + , MotPS exists as an inactive form in the cytoplasmic membrane because MotS C adopts an unfolded confor - mation . When theconcentrationof Na + is increased , the bindingofNa + to MotS C induces the folding of the PGB domain and facilitates its di - merization in a highly cooperative manner . Then , an interaction be - tween MotP and FliG stabilizes the MotPS complex assembled into the motor , which allows the opening of the Na + channel by releasing the plug and the 5 - nm extension of the PGB domain from the TM do - main to bind to the peptidoglycan layer . As a result , MotPS becomes an active Na + - type stator unit to couple the Na + flow with torque genera - tion . When Na + ions are depleted , the PGB domain becomes un - structured , inducing its rapid dissociation from the peptidoglycan layer and dissociation of the MotPS complex from the motor .

Expression and purification of His - tagged MotPS complex DNA manipulations and site - directed mutagenesis were carried out as described previously ( 37 ) . DNA fragments encoding MotPS with a His 6 - tag attached to the N terminus of MotP or the C terminus of MotS were amplified by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) and were cloned into the Nhe I and Xho I sites of the pET21b plasmid vector ( Novagen ) , yielding pET - HPS or pET - PSH plasmid , respectively . A DNA fragment encoding MotPS B - PGB was amplified by PCR using a plasmid named pDR - PSp3sticky ( 10 ) as a template . To express MotPS D peri and MotPS D plug , the corresponding regions were deleted by inverse PCR using the pET - PSH plasmid as a template . The MotS D30A mutation wasintroducedintothepET - PSHplasmidbysite - directedmutagenesis . All plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing with a 3130 Genetic Analyzer ( Applied Biosystems ) . The obtained recombinant plasmids were introduced into the Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) strain ( Stratagene ) . BL21 ( DE3 ) cells harboring a pET21b - based plasmid were grown in L - broth for 4 hours at 30°C . The expression of His - tagged MotPS was induced by adding isopropyl - b - D - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0 . 6 mM , and then the incubation was continued for another 4 hours at 30°C . After washing with 50 mM tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , cells were resuspended in 50 mM tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) containing complete protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) and deoxyribonuclease I ( New England Biolabs ) andweredisruptedbypassagethroughaFrenchpres - sure cell ( FA - 032 , Central Scientific Commerce ) . Undisrupted cells were removed by low - speed centrifugation ( 20 , 000 g , 15 min , 4°C ) . Membranes were collected by ultracentrifugation ( 110 , 000 g , 1 hour , 4°C ) and suspended in 50 mM tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) and 10 % glycerol . The membranes were solubilized in 50 mM tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 10 % glycerol , 500 mM NaCl , and 1 % decyl maltose neopentyl glycol ( DMNG ) ( Anatrace ) for 30 min at 4°C , followed by ultracentrifugation . The solubilized membranes were mixed well with Ni – nitrilotriacetic acid ( NTA ) agarose ( Qiagen ) using a rotator for 30 min at 4°C . The Ni - NTA agarose resin , to which His - tagged MotPS bound , was packed into an open column ( Bio - Rad ) , and then unbound proteins were re - moved bywashing with 50 mM tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 5 % glycerol , 500 mM NaCl , 50 mM imidazole , and 0 . 1 % DMNG . His - tagged MotPS was eluted with 50 mM tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 5 % glycerol , 500 mM NaCl , 400 mM imidazole , and 0 . 05 % DMNG . Pooled fractions containing His - tagged MotPS were loaded onto a Superose 6 10 / 300 GL column ( GE Healthcare ) equilibrated with 20 mM tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 5 % glyc - erol , 500 mM NaCl , and 0 . 05 % DMNG ( fig . S3A ) . To replace DMNG by amphipol , pooled fractions containing MotPS ( fig . S3B ) were mixed with amphipols A8 - 35 ( Anatrace ) at a 1 - to - 3 weight ratio with end - over - end rotation for 12 hours , and then DMNG was removed by the addition of Bio - Beads ( Bio - Rad ) at a final concentration of 15 mg ml − 1 for 24 hours . After centrifugation to remove the Bio - Beads , super - natants were loaded onto a Superdex 200 Increase 10 / 300 GL column ( GEHealthcare ) equilibratedwith20mMtris - HCl ( pH8 . 0 ) and150mM NaCl ( fig . S3 , C and D ) . HS - AFM imaging HS - AFM imaging was performed in solution at room temperature using a laboratory - built HS - AFM setup ( 38 , 39 ) , as described previously ( 40 ) . Inbrief , aglasssamplestage ( diameter , 2mm ; height , 2mm ) witha thin mica disc ( 1 mm in diameter and ~ 0 . 05 mm in thickness ) glued to the top by epoxy was attached onto the top of a Z - scanner by a drop of nail polish . A freshly cleaved mica surface was prepared by removing the top layers of mica using a Scotch tape . Then , a drop ( 2 m l ) of diluted protein sample ( ca . 10 nM ) with an observation buffer [ 20 mM tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) with or without various concentrations of NaCl or KCl ] was deposited onto the mica surface . After incubation for 3 min at room temperature , the mica surface was rinsed with 20 m l of the observation buffer to remove floating samples . The sample stage was then immersed in a liquid cell containing ~ 60 m l of the observation buffer . AFM imag - ing was carried out in a tapping mode using small cantilevers ( BLAC10DS - A2 , Olympus ) ( resonant frequency , ~ 0 . 5 MHz in water ; quality factor , ~ 2 in water ; spring constant , ~ 0 . 1 N m − 1 ) . The cantile - ver ’ sfreeoscillationamplitude A 0 andset - pointamplitude A s weresetat 1 to 2 nm and ~ 0 . 9 × A 0 , respectively . The imaging rate , scan size , and pixel size for each AFM image are described in the figure legends . Buffer exchange system To carry out buffer exchange during HS - AFM imaging , we installed a high - precision syringe pump system ( 11 Pico Plus Elite , Harvard Ap - paratus ) to the liquid cell of HS - AFM , as previously described ( 41 ) with minor modifications . By setting 10 - ml Terumo syringes ( SS - 10SZP , Terumo ) , the constant - pressure and constant - flow pump system con - comitantly infuses buffer solutions on one side and withdraws them from the other side of the liquid cell at a rate ranging from ~ 0 . 2 nl s − 1 to ~ 0 . 2 ml s − 1 , allowing the buffer composition to be gradually ex - changed . Here , we connected two infusion syringes and one withdraw syringe to the pump system and operated the pump at the flow rate of 2 . 5 m l s − 1 . Each of the syringe was connected with a silicon tube of about 60 cm in length , and the other end of the silicon tube was connected with a gel - loading tip ( 1034 - R - 204 , BIO - BIK ) . A buffer solution from one of the infusion syringes was infused into the liquid cell , and a buffer solution from the other infusion syringe was wasted on the sponge placed beside the liquid cell , while the withdraw syringe kept withdraw - ing the buffer solution from the liquid cell to keep the buffer volume ( ca . 60 m l ) constant . Here , NaCl buffer [ 20 mM tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) and 150 mM NaCl ] and KCl buffer [ 20 mM tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 0 ) and 150 mM KCl ] were degassed using an aspirator for 30 min to remove bubbles , each of which was loaded into each infusion syringe . Replacements of the tip ends connected to the infusion syringes were done using XYZ axis manual stages ( M - 152 , Narishige ) . To measure precise Na + con - centrationsofthebuffer , weusedaNa + - sensitivefluorescentdye , CoroNa Green ( Molecular Probes ) , as a Na + indicator . The fluorescence emis - sion spectra of CoroNa Green were recorded on a fluorescence spectro - photometer ( RF - 5300PC , Shimadzu ) . The Na + concentration in the buffer was determined by the fluorescence intensity of the CoroNa Green . To generate a calibration curve , the fluorescence intensities of CoroNa Green were determined over a wide range of 0 to 150 mM . Analysis of AFM images For AFM image analysis , AFM images were pretreated by a low - pass filter to remove spike noise and a flatten filter to make the overall xy plane flat , using a laboratory - built software as described previously ( 42 ) . This software is available at https : / / elifesciences . org / content / 4 / e04806 / article - data - fig - data - supplementary - material . The distances between two ellipsoid domains and the heights of these two domains were ana - lyzed by ImageJ ( https : / / imagej . nih . gov / ij / ) , as described previously ( 43 ) . The surface profiles to go along two ellipsoidal centers of gravity were fitted by multiple Gaussian functions , and each height and center - to - center distance were measured . Data points were collected from S C I E N C E A D V A N C E S | R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E Terahara et al . , Sci . Adv . 2017 ; 3 : eaao4119 1 November 2017 7 of 9 more than 600 frames of 20 individual molecules . Because structural transitions of the MotS C domain rapidly occurred in solution , we de - cided that the MotS C domain took a steady - state conformation if its structure did not change at all in about a minute . At least 100 individ - ual molecules under each condition were analyzed . Simulation of AFM image To simulate AFM images of the MotS C dimer and the MotA 4 tetramer attached to a mica surface , we used a software ( SPM simulator , Ad - vancedAlgorithmSystems ) , asdescribedpreviously ( 23 ) . Thesimulation was carried out with a simple hard sphere model . The cantilever tip was modeled as a circular cone ( apex angle , 10° ) with a small sphere ( radius , 0 . 5 to 2 nm ) at the apex . The crystal structure of the periplasmic domain of MotB ( MotB C ) ( PDB code : 2ZVY ) and the 3D density map of nega - tively stained MotA 4 tetramer ( 25 ) were used as templates to generate simulated AFM images . Each atom in the MotB C protein was modeled as a hard sphere with a corresponding van der Waals radius . We simu - lated AFM images using various radii for the tip apex sphere and found thataradiusof1 . 0nmproducedalmostthesameimagesasexperimental HS - AFM images . The simulated images were processed by a low - pass filter with a cutoff wavelength of 2 nm because a spatial resolution of our HS - AFM images was approximately 2 nm , as judged by the 2D Fourier transformation of actual images .
