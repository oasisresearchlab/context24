Mycolactone has previously been shown to bind to , and alter the structure of , the major translocon subunit Sec61 α , and change its interaction with ribosome nascent chain complexes . In addition to its function in protein translocation into the ER , Sec61 also plays a key role in cellular Ca 2 + homeostasis , acting as a leak channel between the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and cytosol . Here , we have analysed the effect of mycolactone on cytosolic and ER Ca 2 + levels using compartment - specific sensors . We also used molecular docking analysis to explore potential interaction sites for mycolactone on translocons in various states . These results show that mycolactone enhances the leak of Ca 2 + ions via the Sec61 translocon , resulting in a slow but substantial depletion of ER Ca 2 + . This leak was dependent on mycolactone binding to Sec61 α because resistance mutations in this protein completely ablated the increase . Molecular docking supports the existence of a mycolactone - binding transient inhibited state preceding translocation and suggests mycolactone may also bind Sec61 α in its idle state . We propose that delayed ribosomal release after translation termination and / or translocon “breathing” during rapid transitions between the idle and intermediate - inhibited states allow for transient Ca 2 + leak , and mycolactone’s stabilisation of the latter underpins the phenotype observed .

Most pathogenic strains isolated from BU patients living in West Africa , where the disease is most prevalent , produce mycolactone A / B . Other congeners also exist , produced by pathogenic strains found in Australia ( mycolactone C ) and so - called “ancestral” strains . Mycolactone A / B is the most toxic in vitro and is a polyketide composed of an invariant 12 - membered lactone ring to which two polyketide - derived , unsaturated acyl side chains are attached [ 1 , 3 ] . The shorter “Northern” chain is invariant , while the longer “Southern” Chain gives rise to the various mycolactone congeners . Like all mycolactones , mycolactone A / B is a 3 : 2 rapidly - equilibrating mixture of isomers around the second double bond in the Southern fatty acid tails [ 4 ] . Structure - activity studies have proposed that mycolactone B is the active isoform [ 5 ] . Infection with M . ulcerans initially produces a painless swelling or nodule . The immunosuppressive properties of mycolactone enable the disease to progress without inflammation and fever , leading eventually to development of the necrotic lesions in cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues that are characteristic of BU [ 6 ] . Many reports support mycolactone as driving the pathogenic sequelae of BU that comprise skin ulceration , coagulative necrosis , local hypoesthesia and suppression of immune responses . Furthermore , molecular targets for mycolactone have been identified and proposed to be associated with its hallmarks [ 2 , 3 ] . Binding and activation of type 2 angiotensin receptors II initiates a signalling cascade that culminates in the activation of TWIK - related arachidonic acid - stimulated K + channel in neurons [ 7 ] . The resulting hyperpolarisation of neurons was proposed to mediate the analgesic effects of mycolactone . In cell free assays , mycolactone binds to the Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) and neural WASP ( N - WASP ) , which are scaffold proteins involved in the remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton [ 8 , 9 ] . By interacting with WASP / N - WASP , mycolactone likely initiates an uncontrolled assembly of actin and defective cell - matrix adhesion . Notably , the down - regulation of multiple mediators of inflammation correlates solely with the continuous presence of mycolactone even after D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p : / / po r t l andp r e ss . c o m / b i o c he m j / a r t i c l e - pd f / do i / 10 . 1042 / B C J 20210345 / 923964 / b c j - 2021 - 0345 . pd f b y gue s t on 20 N o v e m be r 2021 B i o c he m i c a l J ou r na l .

Subsequently , investigations using cell - free protein synthesis showed that mycolactone inhibits the Sec61 - dependent protein translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) [ 11 ] . Furthermore , the blockade of Sec61 - dependent translocation by mycolactone has been linked to inhibition of T cell activation and antigen presentation , providing a molecular basis for the mycolactone - induced immunosuppression [ 12 , 13 ] . The effects of mycolactone on ER function are however much broader , due to the Sec61 - dependent nature of many ER - resident proteins . However , while it has been shown that mycolactone down - regulates steady state mRNA levels of luminal Hsp70 - type chaperone binding immunoglobulin protein ( BiP ; HSPA5 ) in dendritic cells [ 14 ] , proteomic data indicates that BiP expression may be sustained [ 13 , 14 , Hall , Hsieh et al . , unpublished ] . Furthermore , inhibition of Sec61 - mediated translocation by mycolactone induces an integrated stress response via translational activation of activating transcription factor 4 [ 15 ] . Thus , a consequence of the blockade of Sec61 translocons is a stress response that eventually induces apoptosis and underlies cytotoxic effects of mycolactone . A forward genetic screen in HCT116 cells for mutations that confer resistance to mycolactone - induced toxicity resulted in > 30 clones , all of which contained at least one heterozygous mutation in the gene encoding Sec61 α , SEC61A1 [ 15 , 16 ] indicating that Sec61 α is the prime target of mycolactone . Mutations were clustered at a number of sites in Sec61 α ( D60 , R66 , S71 , G80 , S72 and Q127 ) [ 15 , 16 ] . Several of these mutations have been studied in detail and have been shown to reverse the binding to and / or biological effects of mycolactone [ 12 , 15 - 17 ] . Sec61 α plays a central role in the translocation of nascent polypeptides emerging from the translating ribosome . To accomplish translocation , the Sec61 complex undergoes substantial conformational changes . McKenna et al . ( 2016 ) provided the first biochemical evidence that the binding of mycolactone to Sec61 α also induces conformational changes of the pore geometry [ 18 ] . Several crystal and cryo - electron microscopy structures have revealed the conformation of the native ribosome - Sec61 complex in the non - translocating ( idle ) state [ 19 - 21 ] . Here , the lateral gate of the Sec61 α is closed and the so - called ‘plug’ helix of Sec61 α seals the channel toward the lumenal side [ 22 ] .

Here , the plug is displaced to enable translocation and the lateral gate remains open for membrane access of the signal peptide or transmembrane domains of the nascent precursor polypeptide [ 23 ] . Recently , Gérard et al . [ 16 ] determined the structure of mammalian ribosome - Sec61 complexes inhibited by mycolactone via electron cryo - microscopy , where the Sec61 α channel is trapped in a putative intermediate state . In this state , Sec61 α is in a conformation where the cytosolic side of the lateral gate is open , whereas the plug still occupies the channel pore in the lumenal side . Notably this conformation closely resembles that of yeast Sec61 translocons bound to Sec62 and Sec63 [ 24 , 25 ] , suggesting that this pose is adopted during native translocation at least in lower eukaryotes . The structure provides novel insight into the molecular mechanism of mycolactone as an inhibitor . Notably , mycolactone binds with weaker affinity to translocons from cells carrying resistance mutations in Sec61 α [ 16 ] . Here , molecular dynamics simulations suggested that the single amino acid mutations modulate the conformational dynamics of Sec61 α and thereby disfavour the mycolactone - bound conformation . It is striking that the molecular targets of mycolactone have been associated with key functions in the Ca 2 + homeostasis . For instance , Sec61 α translocons behave as Ca 2 + permeable channels that support a Ca 2 + leak from ER that is regulated by BiP [ 26 ] . Mycolactone may also interact with WASP / N - WASP leading to actin assembly [ 9 ] , potentially impacting Ca 2 + homeostasis because actin polymerisation in the cell periphery prevents the coupling between the ER and store - operated Ca 2 + channels , reducing the Ca 2 + entry into the cell [ 27 ] . On the other hand , actin polymerisation enhances the Ca 2 + mobilisation from ER that is induced by the sarco / endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + - ATPase ( SERCA ) - inhibitor thapsigargin ( TG ) [ 28 ] . Finally , as a lipophilic substance , mycolactone interacts with phospholipids and hence may perturb cholesterol - rich membranes more generally [ 29 - 31 ] . Thus , while it can be hypothesised that mycolactone might distort Ca 2 + homeostasis in the cell , until now this area has been little explored . An early study reported a dose - dependent increase in cytosolic Ca 2 + levels in L929 cells exposed to mycolactone [ 32 ] . Later , it was shown that mycolactone - mediated hyperactivation of Lck in Jurkat cells resulted in depletion of intracellular Ca 2 + stores and T cell receptor downregulation [ 33 ] .

Additionally , mycolactone reduced the store - operated Ca 2 + entry and the Ca 2 + mobilisation induced by the non - selective iononophore ionomycin ( IONO ) in these T cells [ 33 ] . In the present study , we focused on the effects of mycolactone on Ca 2 + leak from the ER . Using mycolactone - resistant mutants of Sec61 (cid:68)(cid:3) [ 15 - 17 ] , we show in Ca 2 + imaging experiments that mycolactone specifically enhances the Sec61 - mediated Ca 2 + leak from ER . By docking analysis , we further explore potential interaction sites for mycolactone with Sec61 translocons at the molecular level . These analyses support the mechanistic model in which mycolactone stabilises the intermediate ( mycolactone - bound / mycolactone - inhibited ) conformation of the ribosome - translocon complex , which in turn generates a Ca 2 + leak from the ER .

D1ER was kindly provided by R . Y . Tsien [ 35 ] and stably expressed in HEK - 293 cells to obtain the D1ER - HEK cell line [ 34 ] . D1ER - HEK cells were cultured under selection with G418 ( Minimal Essential Medium , MEM ( Gibco ) , 10 % FBS , 0 . 5 mg / ml G418 ) . Wild type ( WT ) HCT116 cells and those expressing Sec61 mutants were maintained in McCoy’s 5A Medium ( Gibco ) and 10 % FBS . HCT116 cells expressing Sec61 mutants ( D60G , R66K , S71F , S82Y , Q127K ) were generated by random mutagenesis with ENS in the DNA repair defective HCT116 cell line [ 15 ] . Prior to Ca 2 + imaging experiments , HCT116 cells were plated on poly - L - lysine coated cover slips and transfected with ER calcium sensor ER - GCaMP6 - 150 using FuGENE HD ( Promega Corp . ) . Experiments were carried out 1 - 2 days after transfection . ER - GCaMP6 - 150 was kindly provide by J . de Juan - Sanz and T . A . Ryan [ 36 ] .

Cells were loaded with FURA - 2 prior imaging experiments by incubation with the solution containing 4 μ M FURA - 2 AM for 20 min . MYC , TG and IONO were routinely applied as 2X solutions to the bath at a ratio of 1 : 1 to avoid problems arising from slow mixing . MYC was added to the culture medium at the desired concentrations and cells were cultured for 1 , 6 and 18 h before imaging recordings . For the so - called “online” treatment in Ca 2 + imaging experiments , MYC was applied to the bath while the recording of images was running ( Figure 3A ) . When cells were transfected with ER - GCaMP6 - 150 , MYC was present in the culture medium containing the transfection reagents during the last 6 h before imaging recordings . Controls for all experiments were DMSO diluted to a similar extent as the highest concentration found in mycolactone treatments , i . e . 0 . 02 - 0 . 05 % v / v DMSO in bath solution or culture medium . Live Cell Ca 2 + Imaging Ca 2 + imaging experiments were carried out in the absence of Ca 2 + in the bath solution to prevent Ca 2 + entry from extracellular space . Thus , the bath solution contained 140 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM EGTA , 10 mM glucose and 10 mM HEPES - KOH ( pH 7 . 35 ) . Using an iMIC microscope equipped with a polychromator V and the Live Acquisition Software ( Till Photonics ) , we imaged cytosolic Ca 2 + concentrations ( [ Ca 2 + ] cyt ) using FURA - 2 ( i ) and Ca 2 + concentrations in ER ( [ Ca 2 + ] ER ) with the Ca 2 + sensors D1ER ( ii ) and ER - GCaMP6 - 150 ( iii ) . i ) Imaging cytosolic Ca 2 + with FURA - 2 .

FURA - 2 signals were measured in image pairs as F340 / F380 , where F340 and F380 correspond to the background - subtracted fluorescence intensity at 340 and 380 nm excitation wavelengths , respectively . [ Ca 2 + ] cyt was calculated with the standard ratiometric equation [ Ca 2 + ] free = (cid:69) K d , ( ( R - R min ) / ( R max - R ) ) , in which R = F340 / F380 [ 38 ] .

Results of FURA - 2 measurements are presented either as F340 / F380 ratios or as [ Ca 2 + ] cyt . ii ) Imaging ER Ca 2 + with D1ER . D1ER - HEK cells were exposed to 433 nm and the emitted fluorescence was split at 469 nm and 536 nm to obtain the CFP and citrine components , respectively [ 35 ] . The cell fluorescence was additionally passed through a dichrotome and projected on the chip of the microscope camera to obtain simultaneous CFP and citrine images . The FRET ratios were calculated from background - subtracted CFP and citrine image pairs as F Citrine / F CFP , where F Citrine and F CFP represent the citrine and CFP fluorescence intensities at 536 nm and 469 nm , respectively . To allow the recording of [ Ca 2 + ] cyt and [ Ca 2 + ] ER in the same cells , the FURA - 2 and D1ER filter sets were exchanged automatically [ 34 ] . In each cycle , FURA - 2 images were first recorded at 340 and 380 nm excitation and D1ER images at 469 and 536 nm emission afterwards . D1ER and FURA - 2 images containing 10 - 15 cells / frame were obtained at 60x magnification every 10 s . Results of D1ER and FURA - 2 measurements that reflect the dynamic of [ Ca 2 + ] ER and [ Ca 2 + ] cyt in the same cells are presented as F Citrine / F CFP and F340 / F380 ratios , respectively . iii ) Imaging ER Ca 2 + with ER - GCaMP6 - 150 .

Images with 3 - 10 cells / frame were recorded at a 60x magnification every 2 s . The ER - GCaMP6 - 150 fluorescence ( F ) was measured in background - subtracted images and normalised with respect to the fluorescence measured 2 min after starting recordings ( F 0 ) . Results of measurements with ER - GCaMP6 - 150 that reflect the dynamic of [ Ca 2 + ] ER are presented as F / F 0 ratios .

The structural information of the missing part of 6Z3T was obtained by homology modelling based on 2WWB ( EM structure with resolution 6 . 48 Å ) . Homology modelling was performed using MODELLER 9 . 21 [ 39 ] . After sequence alignment of target and template , MODELLER was run locally with the automodel class to generate 50 different models . As structure 3JC2 is lacking structural information for the plug region , the plug region of the open conformation was modelled as loop . The homology model with the lowest discrete optimization of potential energy ( DOPE ) score was selected as the final model and subjected to 1000 steps of energy minimization , using the GROMACS package ( version 5 . 0 . 7 ) [ 40 ] to relax side chain atoms . For this , the protonation states of titratable amino acids were determined by the web server PDB2PQR [ 41 ] using the PROPKA method [ 42 ] . The total charge of Sec61 α was + 4e . Two different isomers of MYC were used for docking , MYC B ( E - isomer ) and MYC A ( Z - isomer ) ( see Supplementary Figure S1 ) . Docking of MYC was conducted using AutoDock4 . 2 [ 43 ] to predict energetically favourable binding poses of the ligand inside or on the surface of WT human Sec61 α in the idle , open and MYC - inhibited conformations . With respect to protein - ligand docking , MYC is a large compound containing 23 rotatable bonds . For each ligand , MYC A and B , the docking calculations were performed in two consecutive steps : in the first docking step , we adopted a relatively large grid box ( 100 Å × 100 Å × 126 Å ) ( see Supplementary Figure S2 ) covering the entire cavity of Sec61 α in order to achieve an unbiased approach to determine potential binding sites . The Lamarckian genetic algorithm was employed to search for favourable binding poses , with a population size of 150 , 27 × 10 3 generations and 25 × 10 5 energy evaluations . All other docking parameters for protein and ligand were set to the default values of AutoDock . 2000 individual docking results were clustered according to a threshold for structural similarity of 2 . 0 Å RMSD . In each cluster , the representative conformation was set to the one with the lowest binding free energy for that cluster . Three independent sets of 2000 docking runs each were conducted in the first stage . In the second docking stage , the size of the grid box was reduced to 90 Å × 80 Å × 80 Å dimension ( idle conformation ) , 80 Å × 90 Å × 80 Å dimension ( intermediate conformation ) , and 80 Å × 80 Å × 90 Å ( open conformation ) , respectively . This was done based on the populations of the most stable binding positions of the ligand .

In this stage , we executed five independent fine docking runs for the idle and intermediate conformations of Sec61 α . The first step of docking to the open conformation of Sec61 α showed a larger conformational diversity of MYC within the Sce61 α channel pore than for the idle conformation , ten independent fine docking runs were performed for the open conformation . In each docking run we generated 50 docked conformations . Membrane - associated Polysome Profiling RAW 264 . 7 cells grown to 80 % confluency on 15 cm dishes were incubated with 31 . 25 ng / ml MYC or solvent control for 4 h at 37°C . Membrane - associated polysomes were prepared following the methods described in Potter and Nicchitta , 2002 [ 44 ] , with modifications . Cyclohexamide ( CHX ) ( 100 μ g / ml ) was added 5 min prior to harvesting . Cells were washed once with ice - cold PBS containing 100 μ g / ml CHX then harvested in KHM buffer ( 25 mM K - Hepes , pH 7 . 2 , 400 mM KOAc , 25 mM Mg ( OAc ) 2 , 100 μ g / ml CHX ) . Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 280 x g for 3 min at 4°C , then resuspended in ice - cold KHM containing 0 . 03 % digitonin and incubated on ice for 5 min . After centrifugation again at 280 x g for 3 min at 4°C , pellets were solubilised by incubation with KHM containing 2 % digitonin , 1 mM PMSF and 40 U / ml RNase inhibitor . Lysates were centrifuged at 7500 g for 10 min at 4°C and layered onto a 10 - 60 % sucrose gradient in KMH containing 0 . 1 % digitonin and 100 μ g / ml CHX . Polysome profiling was carried out as described previously [ 11 ] . Proteins in column fractions were acetone precipitated and separated by SDS PAGE on 4 - 15 % gradient gels ( Bio - Rad ) and blotted onto Immobilon PVDF membranes ( Merck ) .

Biochemical evidence from translocation assays support its inhibition of Sec61 (cid:68) at a step after the engagement of ribosomes [ 18 ] , raising the possibility that one aspect of the cellular action of mycolactone is the disruption of the Ca 2 + homeostasis due to its interaction with Sec61 α within the ER membrane . In order to explore this possibility , we analysed the Ca 2 + homeostatic mechanisms in cells treated with mycolactone . We imaged the cytosolic Ca 2 + concentration ( [ Ca 2 + ] cyt ) with FURA - 2 as well as the Ca 2 + concentration in ER ( [ Ca 2 + ] ER ) with the genetically encoded sensors D1ER and ER - GCaMP6 - 150 [ 34 , 36 ] . Since [ Ca 2 + ] ER is maintained around 100 - 800 μ M by a dynamic equilibrium between the leak of Ca 2 + ions from the ER and the action of SERCA pumping Ca 2 + back into the ER , as well as by the Ca 2 + buffering of ER resident proteins [ 46 , 47 ] , the SERCA - inhibitor thapsigargin ( TG ) unmasks the Ca 2 + leak producing a transient increase in [ Ca 2 + ] cyt . Typically , TG - induced Ca 2 + transients are characterised by a rapid onset and short duration in most mammalian cells , provided that the entry of Ca 2 + ions into the cell has been suppressed by removing extracellular Ca 2 + [ 48 ] . Figure 1A - C illustrates the effects of 125 ng / ml mycolactone on the Ca 2 + mobilisation induced by TG in HCT116 cells in the absence of external Ca 2 + . When Ca 2 + transients of mycolactone - treated cells were compared with the DMSO controls , we observed that mycolactone reduced both the duration and the peak amplitude of the cytosolic Ca 2 + transients after 1 , 6 and 18 h of exposure ( Figure 1A - C ) . Such effects are best quantified as the area under the curve ( AUC ) , which is calculated by integration of the Ca 2 + transients . Figure 1D shows that mycolactone significantly reduced the AUC of TG - induced Ca 2 + transients , indicating that the amount of Ca 2 + mobilised by TG from ER is lower in mycolactone - treated cells . Similar effects of mycolactone on cytosolic Ca 2 + transients were also observed with macrophage RAW 264 . 7 cells ( Supplementary Figure S3 ) . Since ER Ca 2 + depletion as well as increased Ca 2 + leak from ER can explain the attenuation of TG - induced Ca 2 + transients by mycolactone , we next used ionomycin ( IONO ) in order to estimate the total amount of Ca 2 + that can be mobilised in HCT116 cells .

The AUC analysis revealed that HCT116 cells lost about 2 / 3 of the mobilisable Ca 2 + after 6 h treatment with 125 ng / ml mycolactone ( Figure 1F ) . Thus , mycolactone likely compromises the Ca 2 + homeostasis in a way that reduces the Ca 2 + storage levels and attenuates Ca 2 + signalling in HCT116 cells . These observations cannot be explained by cytotoxicity since the viability of these cells after 18 h mycolactone exposure was similar to DMSO control cells ( Figure 1G ) . In HCT116 cells , less than 10 ng / ml mycolactone is sufficient to maximally reduce cell viability [ 15 ] after 5 days exposure . Since we used 125 ng / ml mycolactone in previous experiments ( Figure 1 ) , the question arises as whether low concentrations of mycolactone also induce attenuation of TG - induced Ca 2 + transients . Therefore , we next exposed HCT116 cells to a dilution series between 3 . 9 ng / ml and 125 ng / ml mycolactone for 6 h . Thereafter , cells were exposed to TG to induce Ca 2 + mobilisation from ER . As shown in Figure 2A , 3 . 9 ng / ml mycolactone shortened the Ca 2 + transients without major effect on the amplitude . Higher concentrations of mycolactone shortened the TG - induced Ca 2 + transients further and these transients displayed noticeably smaller amplitudes , with the consequence that the AUC of TG - induced Ca 2 + transients displayed a dose - dependent inhibition by mycolactone ( Figure 2B ) . Mycolactone enhances the Ca 2 + leak from ER We found that the total amount of mobilisable Ca 2 + in HCT116 cells is reduced by mycolactone ( Figure 1E , F ) , suggesting that the ER Ca 2 + content may be compromised in mycolactone - treated cells . We hypothesised that an increased Ca 2 + leak that leads to ER Ca 2 + depletion during the exposure to mycolactone likely contributes to the attenuation of Ca 2 + transients that were observed in HCT116 cells ( Figure 1A - C ) , because the amplitude and duration of TG - induced Ca 2 + transients are determined by Ca 2 + content of the ER as well as by the Ca 2 + leak from ER . In order to test this hypothesis , we therefore imaged the changes in [ Ca 2 + ] ER and [ Ca 2 + ] cyt in the same cells ( Figure 3 ) . [ Ca 2 + ] ER was imaged using the FRET - based ER Ca 2 + sensor D1ER [ 35 ] , which was stably expressed in HEK - 293 cells ( D1ER - HEK ) [ 34 ] . D1ER - HEK cells were additionally loaded with FURA - 2 to image [ Ca 2 + ] cyt . In the first series of experiments , we applied mycolactone to D1ER - HEK cells for 17 min “online” in order to D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p : / / po r t l andp r e ss . c o m / b i o c he m j / a r t i c l e - pd f / do i / 10 . 1042 / B C J 20210345 / 923964 / b c j - 2021 - 0345 . pd f b y gue s t on 20 N o v e m be r 2021 B i o c he m i c a l J ou r na l .

Surprisingly , while the cytosolic Ca 2 + levels slightly increased during the exposure to mycolactone , ER Ca 2 + was not affected by mycolactone . At the end of the exposure to mycolactone , the TG - application induced a depletion of ER Ca 2 + that reflects the unmasking of the Ca 2 + leak from ER , as previously reported [ 34 ] . As shown in Figure 3A ( upper panel ) , the time course of ER Ca 2 + depletion was faster in D1ER - HEK cells treated with mycolactone when compared to DMSO controls . Analysis of the time to 50 % decay in ER Ca 2 + ( t 1 / 2 ) revealed a 1 . 6 times faster decay of [ Ca 2 + ] ER in cells treated with mycolactone for 17 min ( Figure 3D ) . This fast Ca 2 + depletion is indicative of a mycolactone - induced enhancement of the Ca 2 + leak from ER within minutes of exposure . By prolonging the exposures to 6 and 18 h , the effects of mycolactone became more pronounced ( Figure 3B , C , upper panels ) and t 1 / 2 became 2 . 7 faster at 18 h exposure ( Figure 3D ) . Additionally , we observed that the basal ER Ca 2 + levels decreased after 18 h mycolactone treatment ( Figure 3C , upper panels ) , indicating that mycolactone enhances the Ca 2 + leak from ER , which in the long term produces a continuous Ca 2 + depletion in the ER . The corresponding effects of mycolactone on the cytosolic Ca 2 + transients were less pronounced in the “online” and 6 h experiments but the duration and peak amplitude of the transients were strongly reduced after 18 h mycolactone treatment ( Figure 3A - C , lower panels ) . Accordingly , the AUC of the Ca 2 + transients was only significantly reduced after the 18 h mycolactone treatment ( Figure 3E ) . The most parsimonious implication of this observation is that mycolactone effects are best detectable at the level of cytosolic Ca 2 + transients when the enhanced Ca 2 + leak has produced a considerable ER Ca 2 + depletion , as illustrated by the 18 h experiment ( Figure 3C , lower panel ) . However , the enhancement of Ca 2 + leak induced by mycolactone was detectable as accelerated ER Ca 2 + depletion as early as 17 min after treatment ( Figure 3A , upper panel ) . Sec61 complexes are involved in the mycolactone effects on ER Ca 2 + leak Since mycolactone targets the (cid:68) subunit of Sec61 complexes in the ER membrane [ 12 , 16 ] , altering its conformation [ 16 , 18 ] , and Sec61 complexes form a Ca 2 + leak pathway from ER [ 49 ] , a distinct possibility is that mycolactone stabilises a conformation , in which Sec61 complexes are permeable to Ca 2 + . To test this hypothesis , we took advantage of a series of mycolactone - resistant HCT116 cell clones that have heterozygous non - synonymous mutations within the SEC61A1 gene encoding Sec61 (cid:68) , which have been shown to reduce D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p : / / po r t l andp r e ss . c o m / b i o c he m j / a r t i c l e - pd f / do i / 10 . 1042 / B C J 20210345 / 923964 / b c j - 2021 - 0345 . pd f b y gue s t on 20 N o v e m be r 2021 B i o c he m i c a l J ou r na l .

For our Ca 2 + imaging experiments , we selected the cell line expressing Sec61 α D60G , which is located in the cytosolic loop ( CL ) 1 of Sec61 (cid:68) , as well as the cell lines expressing Sec61 α S82Y and Q127K , which are located in the transmembrane segments ( TM ) 2 and 3 , respectively , and the mutations R66K and S71F which are located in the transition between CL1 and TM2 . Using the ER Ca 2 + sensor ER - GCaMP6 - 150 [ 36 ] , we have visualised the TG - induced depletion of ER Ca 2 + as a direct surrogate of Ca 2 + leak in these cell lines ( Figure 4 ) . As expected , ER - GCaMP6 - 150 detected an exponential Ca 2 + depletion in wild type ( WT ) HCT116 cells ( Figure 4A ) , as well as in all clones containing Sec61 (cid:68) mutants ( Figure 4B - F ) . Notably , the rate of Ca 2 + depletion was different in each clone as revealed by the t 1 / 2 values ( Figure 4G ) , particularly for D60G and S82Y . This suggests that the mutations themselves may impact the structure and function of Sec61 translocons , as expected as they are prl mutants . In WT HCT116 cells mycolactone reduced the t 1 / 2 by about 45 % ( Figure 4A , G ) , in line with the observation using the ER Ca 2 + sensor D1ER ( Figure 3D ) . However , the effects of mycolactone on cells expressing the Sec61 (cid:68) mutants varied slightly according to the mutation . For instance , mycolactone no longer caused any change to the t 1 / 2 with the Sec61 (cid:68)(cid:3) S71F mutant ( Figure 4D , G ) . Although not statistically significant , longer t 1 / 2 values were observed in the Sec61 (cid:68)(cid:3) D60G and Sec61 (cid:68)(cid:3) R66K mutants ( Figure 4B , C , G ) . Compared with the respective DMSO controls , significantly shorter t 1 / 2 values were detected in the Sec61 (cid:68) mutants S82Y and Q127K ( Figure 4E - G ) , although these mycolactone effects were always less pronounced than the nearly 45 % reduction of t 1 / 2 in WT HCT116 cells . In the case of the Sec61 (cid:68) S82Y mutant , mycolactone reduced t 1 / 2 by about 12 % ( Figure 4E , G ) , a much milder effect . All in all , the direct analysis of the TG - induced ER Ca 2 + depletion provided evidence that mycolactone no longer enhances Ca 2 + leak from ER in HCT116 cells expressing the mycolactone resistance mutations in Sec61 α ( Figure 4 ) . Hence , our results strongly support the suggestion that Ca 2 + leak from ER in the presence of mycolactone is mediated by Sec61 α . Supporting this suggestion , siRNA knockdown of SEC61A1 in HeLa cells abolished the enhancing effects of mycolactone on Sec61 α - mediated Ca 2 + leak ( data not shown ) . Furthermore , the absent or weakened Ca 2 + leak from the ER could be a contributing factor to the increased mycolactone resistance of these cell lines in cell survival assays [ 15 , 16 ] .

Both mycolactone isomers were placed near the cytosolic entrance of the idle WT Sec61 α pore ( see Figures 5 and 6 , bottom left panels ) and mainly occupied the volume between cytosolic loops 6 and 4 ( CL6 and CL4 ) . The long acyl tails ( Southern tail ) of both mycolactones face towards the CL4 region . The docking results suggest that the Northern acyl side chain of both mycolactone A and B could potentially form hydrogen bonds with the CL6 region because residues from the region Pro280 - Ser287 ( CL6 - TM7 ) were predicted to strongly interact with both isomers of mycolactone . For the mycolactone - inhibited conformation , the docking results suggest that mycolactone occupies the groove between TM8 , TM2 and TM7 helices ( Figures 5 and 6 , bottom middle panels ) . The docking position of the lactone core of mycolactone compares well to the orientation of mycolactone determined in the EM structure [ 16 ] . In contrast to the EM structure , the longer acyl side chain ( southern chain ) of mycolactone is oriented towards the lateral gate ( Figures 5 and 6 , bottom middle panels ) , possibly due to the absence of lipids in the docking analysis . These docking results suggest that both mycolactones A and B can interact with this conformation of Sec61 α with similar binding energies of − 8 . 21 ± 1 . 1 and − 8 . 67 ± 0 . 6 kcal / mol , respectively . Residues from the region Leu89 - Lys98 ( TM2 ) strongly interact with both isomers of mycolactone . The most favourable final binding poses of mycolactone A and B are displayed in Figures 5 and 6 , respectively . For the open conformation of Sec61 α , the docking results placed mycolactone inside the channel pore that would normally be the translocation path of substrate peptides . Mycolactone A was placed here in two main arrangements that we refer to as ‘ring - like’ or ‘extended’ conformations ( Figure 5 , bottom right panel ) . The ‘extended’ conformation was slightly more favourable with a binding energy of − 9 . 02 ± 0 . 5 kcal / mol than the ‘ring - like’ conformation ( − 8 . 21 ± 0 . 6 kcal / mol ) . In the ‘extended’ conformation , the acyl side chains of mycolactone A often formed hydrogen bonds with residues in CL6 , lumenal loop ( LL ) 9 and D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p : / / po r t l andp r e ss . c o m / b i o c he m j / a r t i c l e - pd f / do i / 10 . 1042 / B C J 20210345 / 923964 / b c j - 2021 - 0345 . pd f b y gue s t on 20 N o v e m be r 2021 B i o c he m i c a l J ou r na l .

In the ‘ring - like’ conformation , mycolactone A interacted with the N - terminal region of TM2 , LL9 and TM5 . mycolactone B also adopted the ‘extended’ conformation ( see Figure 6 ) inside the channel pore and the ligand pose looked like a ‘bridge’ between the plug region and the loop CL6 similar to mycolactone A . The acyl side chains of mycolactone B often interacted with residues of CL6 , LL9 , plug and TM5 . The lowest binding energy of mycolactone B was − 8 . 78 ± 0 . 6 kcal / mol . Ca 2 + leak due to mycolactone is not due to ribosome dissociation from translocons Our data suggest that mycolactone causes Ca 2 + leak predominantly by altering the structure of Sec61 α within the Sec61 translocon . However , other molecules that associate with the translocon could also cause increased Ca 2 + leak if their function was altered . For instance , BiP ( HSPA5 ) is known to bind to Sec61 α in the region of ER lumenal loop 7 and depletion increases Ca 2 + leak [ 26 ] . A priori , however , while BiP is a Sec61 substrate that should be mycolactone sensitive , it is known not to be reduced for at least 16 - 24 h following exposure in a wide range of different cell types [ 13 , 14 , Hall , Hsieh and Simmonds et al . , unpublished ] . Alternatively , ribosome disassembly and subsequent loss of polysomes , for instance by puromycin [ 50 ] , also increases the Sec61 - mediated Ca 2 + leak from the ER [ 51 ] . Previous studies have shown that mycolactone reduces the abundance of polysomes and increases that of the 60S ribosomal subunit peak in the sub - polysomes in 1 % triton cell extracts , where cytosolic ribosomes predominate [ 11 ] , with typical profiles shown in Figure 7A ( DMSO , left panel ; mycolactone , right panel ) . In order to investigate the effect of mycolactone on ribosome association with mRNA at the ER , we analysed the membrane - associated polysome profile of cells exposed to mycolactone using digitonin extracts . In DMSO control cells , although the yield was lower , the profile was similar to that of the cytosolic fraction ( Figure 7A , B , left panel ) . Following 4 h mycolactone exposure , the polysomal peak was reduced , with an increase in the 80S peak ( Figure 7B , right panel ) . In addition , immunoblotting of the polysome gradient fractions showed a shift of Sec61 α from the polysomal fraction in control cells to the 80S fraction in mycolactone - treated cells ( Figure 7C ; compare DMSO , left panel , with mycolactone , right panel ) . Sec61 (cid:69) is expressed in excess over Sec61 (cid:68) in cells , and is therefore found widely in ER membranes , not just in association with Sec61 (cid:68)(cid:3) [ 49 ] . Hence it can be also seen accumulating in the 80S fractions with Sec61 α in mycolactone treated cells , indicating the presence of intact translocons .

Also , we present results from molecular docking aimed at identifying putative binding modes of mycolactone to various conformational states of the pore - forming subunit Sec61 α . We will start this discussion by summarizing the existing experimental data on how mycolactone affects Sec61 α function . Then , we will connect this with the available structural data and docking results and , finally , suggest an integrated mechanistic model for mycolactone action on Sec61 complexes . It has been known for some time that Sec61 complexes can facilitate the leak of Ca 2 + ions from the ER to the cytosol [ 51 ] , which are normally pumped back into the ER by the SERCA pump . Application of the SERCA pump inhibitor TG prevents this and leads to emptying of the ER Ca 2 + due to the Ca 2 + leak . This is followed by partitioning of Ca 2 + to other intracellular compartments or clearance from cells . Accordingly , we observed an ER Ca 2 + depletion that followed an exponential time course after TG application to D1ER - HEK , where the Ca 2 + leak determines the speed of Ca 2 + depletion ( Figure 3A - C , upper panels ) . Mycolactone increased the speed of ER Ca 2 + depletion with treatments as short as 17 min and , therefore , we suggest that the enhancement of Ca 2 + leak from ER is one of the earliest events within the cellular action of mycolactone ( Figure 3A , upper panel ) . The TG - induced cytosolic Ca 2 + transients depicted in Figure 3A - C ( lower panels ) reflected both the speed of Ca 2 + depletion as well as the absolute amount of Ca 2 + contained in the ER . In general , when the Ca 2 + leak increases , the cytosolic Ca 2 + transients became shorter because the ER is quickly depleted of Ca 2 + . Additionally , the amplitudes of Ca 2 + transients decrease when the ER Ca 2 + content is reduced by a sustained high Ca 2 + leak . In line with this suggestion , TG - induced cytosolic Ca 2 + transients of small amplitude and short duration were detected in D1ER - HEK cells only when the Ca 2 + leak has considerably depleted the ER of Ca 2 + during 18 h exposures to mycolactone ( Figure 3C , lower panel ) . Similarly , small and short TG - induced cytosolic Ca 2 + transients were observed after exposures of HCT116 and RAW 264 . 7 cells to mycolactone for more than 1 h ( Figure 1 , Supplementary Figure S3 ) . Furthermore , we found that the effects of mycolactone on Ca 2 + leak increase dose - dependently ( Figure 3 ) , D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p : / / po r t l andp r e ss . c o m / b i o c he m j / a r t i c l e - pd f / do i / 10 . 1042 / B C J 20210345 / 923964 / b c j - 2021 - 0345 . pd f b y gue s t on 20 N o v e m be r 2021 B i o c he m i c a l J ou r na l .

Thus , our data collectively suggests that the effects of mycolactone on the Ca 2 + homeostasis build from the enhancement of ER Ca 2 + leak to the attenuation of cytosolic Ca 2 + signalling ( Figure 8 ) . Because mycolactone crosses cell membranes by passive diffusion and accumulates in the cell in a time - dependent manner [ 3 , 32 ] , it causes a gradual increase of the ER Ca 2 + leak and a slow decrease of ER Ca 2 + content upon application in cellula ( Figure 8A ) . The corresponding dwindling of TG - induced Ca 2 + transient was observed in RAW 264 . 7 , D1ER - HEK and HCT116 cells with at least 1 h exposure to mycolactone and appears to be a general feature of the mycolactone action ( Figure 8B ) . The time - scale of effects is , however , quite different to those reported for other modulators of Sec61 - mediated Ca 2 + leak such as eeyarestatin , which is predicted to bind Sec61 complexes in the open state [ 34 , 49 ] . For comparison , therefore , we exposed HCT116 cells to the calmodulin inhibitor trifluoperazine ( TFP , Supplementary Figure S4 ) , which is an enhancer of Sec61 mediated Ca 2 + leak [ 52 ] . As shown in Figure 8B , the time - dependent dwindling of TG - induced Ca 2 + transients was recapitulated by the exposure to TFP , albeit much faster with a time scale of minutes . We presume that this difference is due to the different modes of action , where TFP inhibits calmodulin , which normally limits the Sec61 - mediated Ca 2 + leak [ 52 ] , and mycolactone promotes a putative intermediate state of Sec61 (cid:68) [ 16 ] with corresponding effects on ribosome recycling ( see below ) . TFP may also enter cells faster than mycolactone . Interestingly , but perhaps unsurprisingly , there is a reasonable correlation between the slow action on Ca 2 + leak and the kinetics of toxicity , since mycolactone - exposed cells take 4 - 5 days to die [ 53 ] . Thus , the comparison of mycolactone and TFP suggest that the dwindling of TG - induced Ca 2 + transients in cells exposed to mycolactone follows a general mechanism based on the enhancement of Ca 2 + leak from ER ( Figure 8B ) . Further analyses of the ER Ca 2 + depletion in HCT116 cells carrying mycolactone - resistant Sec61 (cid:68) mutations enabled us to pin down the role of Sec61 translocons in the effects of mycolactone on the Ca 2 + leak from ER ( Figure 4 ) . We observed no statistically significant effects of mycolactone with the Sec61 (cid:68) mutants D60G , R66K and S71F , indicating that mycolactone has no effect on the Ca 2 + leak supported by these Sec61 (cid:68) mutants .

This demonstrates that the effect of mycolactone on Ca 2 + leak is extremely likely to be related to its interaction with Sec61 α rather than its other reported targets , or a general disturbance of phospholipid bilayer integrity . The effects of mycolatone on the Ca 2 + leak mediated by the S82Y and Q127K mutants may reflect differences in the effect of the mutations on the structure and function of the Sec61 translocon . This is not unexpected , since most have been previously associated with the prl phenotype , which alters the efficiency of translocation depending on the nature of the signal peptide [ 16 ] . Further Ca 2 + imaging experiments are required to characterise the kinetic of the Ca 2 + leak mediated by mycolactone - resistant Sec61 mutants . McKenna et al . ( 2016 ) found that ribosomes still bind to the Sec61 complex in the presence of mycolactone but observed discrete changes in the architecture of the ribosome – nascent chain ( RNC ) - Sec61 interaction , as evidenced by cross - linking of the nascent chain to Sec61 subunits [ 18 ] . Additionally , mycolactone treatment altered the trypsin sensitivity of CL6 and CL8 ( implicated in ribosome binding ) of Sec61 α . On this basis , this biochemical analysis favoured a model where mycolactone perturbs the interaction between signal peptide and the ribosome - Sec61 complex that is necessary for co - translational translocation to progress . The recent analysis of the mycolactone - bound translocon shows that the conformation of the translocon is no longer similar to that of the idle translocon , with Sec61 α instead adopting a position that is wedged open at the lateral gate [ 16 ] . The lactone ring of mycolactone binds near the lateral gate and stabilises it in a partially open conformation . Molecular re - docking of mycolactone into a homology model of the EM structure of the mycolactone - bound state confirms the plausible position of the lactone ring identified by Gérard et al . ( 2020 ) . Previously , Aydin et al . ( 2019 ) characterized the orientational preference of mycolactone in a plain DPPC bilayer by molecular dynamics simulations [ 54 ] . They reported that the highly hydrophobic lactone ring prefers to be buried among the hydrophobic lipid tails of the phospholipid bilayer , whereas the hydroxyl groups that are found on the side chains either tend to stretch out to the hydrophilic lipid headgroups or D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p : / / po r t l andp r e ss . c o m / b i o c he m j / a r t i c l e - pd f / do i / 10 . 1042 / B C J 20210345 / 923964 / b c j - 2021 - 0345 . pd f b y gue s t on 20 N o v e m be r 2021 B i o c he m i c a l J ou r na l .

Hence , the more extended conformation of mycolactone reported by Gérard et al . ( 2020 ) appears more plausible than the compact conformation identified in the docking run [ 16 ] . Molecular docking of mycolactone to the idle state also revealed a novel potential binding site on the surface of Sec61 α . Molecular docking of mycolactone to the open state identified further putative binding positions in the channel pore . However , noting the just mentioned preference of mycolactone ' s lactone ring and its Northern and Southern chains for a patterned , mixed hydrophobic / hydrophilic environment [ 54 ] , these docking positions in the water - filled hydrophilic pore of the open state appear less likely . Also , there is so far no experimental evidence supporting such binding modes . Similar to Gérard et al . ( 2020 ) , these docking runs position mycolactone with the core and Northern chain within the translocon and the Southern chain extending from the translocon into the ER membrane . It has been known for some time that the Southern chain of mycolactone is important for cytotoxic and / or cytokine suppressing activity of mycolactone [ 3 ] . Since forward genetic screens have unambiguously linked these readouts to Sec61 α [ 12 , 15 , 16 ] , this data can be used as a retrospective surrogate for Sec61 complex inhibition . Here , naturally occurring mycolactones with differing specific activities are invariant in the Northern chain and lactone core , but vary in the Southern chain methylation , hydroxylation and / or length . Furthermore , wide - ranging structure - function studies using synthetic variants of mycolactone [ 55 ] have revealed that variations in the Northern chain are generally well - tolerated , whereas the Southern chain is much more sensitive to even small perturbations in structure . After addition of even bulky functional groups to the Northern chain at C14 or C20 mycolactone retains cytotoxic activity . On the other hand , truncation of the Southern chain to C6 ʹ or C2 ʹ , or completely removing it results in a molecule with much reduced activity . A synthetic mycolactone produced by Scherr et al . ( 2013 ) , with no hydroxylation of the Southern chain , was found to retain minimal cytotoxic activity [ 56 ] . More specifically to translocation , structural variants of mycolactone lacking the Northern chain can still compete with cotransin ( CT7 ) for Sec61 α binding , whereas those lacking the Southern chain or both chains cannot [ 12 ] . These data strongly suggest that the lactone core and Northern chain interacts directly with TM2 of the translocon , explaining the evolutionary conservation of these elements of the structure . On the other hand , we propose that the Southern chain has essential interactions with the lipid bilayer and ascribe D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p : / / po r t l andp r e ss . c o m / b i o c he m j / a r t i c l e - pd f / do i / 10 . 1042 / B C J 20210345 / 923964 / b c j - 2021 - 0345 . pd f b y gue s t on 20 N o v e m be r 2021 B i o c he m i c a l J ou r na l .

Interactions of the tail groups with phospholipid headgroups may serve to anchor the molecule , stabilising the inhibited conformation of the translocon . The idle state represents a non - translocating ‘primed’ state of Sec61 α bound to ribosomes with closed lateral gate and the plug in place . This state is represented by the structure reported by Voorhees et al . ( 2014 ) and , so far , there is no evidence that Sec61 translocons support Ca 2 + flux in this idle state [ 57 ] . After binding of the ribosome and shortly before engagement of the signal peptide within the lateral gate , we postulate that Sec61 α rapidly transitions between this and an intermediate state , that closely resembles that of the yeast Sec62 / Sec63 - bound translocon required for post - translational translocation in that species . Bhadra et al . ( 2021 ) recently characterized by molecular dynamics simulations how Sec63 modulates opening of the lateral gate of Sec61 in yeast [ 58 ] . However , this transient structure has not yet been seen in the absence of mycolactone or other inhibitors [ 16 ] . It is plausible that the conformation of the intermediate state in Figure 9 may differ from that reported for the mycolactone - Sec61 α complex , which has an open lateral gate , and the plug helix is intact but displaced . It is conceivable that “translocon breathing” could be associated with very transient states in which Ca 2 + ions can leak out of the ER . If so , mycolactone’s stabilisation of this state would clearly support the leak of Ca 2 + ions observed even at doses where all translocons are expected to be saturated with mycolactone . Considering the known three conformations of Sec61 α ( idle , intermediate , open ) , we postulate that mycolactone preferentially binds to , and stabilises , the intermediate conformation , which is structurally similar to the inhibited conformation . Translocon breathing suggests a mechanism for mycolactone’s accessing of the translocon , as unbound mycolactone distributed in the ER membrane could penetrate the lateral gate during this step . This is in line with the structure – activity relationship data for mycolactone variants [ 56 , 59 , 60 ] . Alternatively , our docking analysis predicts that mycolactone could potentially bind on the cytosolic entrance of the Sec61 α pore . In the scheme of Figure 9 , nascent chain translocation occurs after the plug has moved out of the pore ( translocating state ) .

When translocation is completed , the channel pore is briefly left open ( post - translocation state ) by the exiting peptide making this state Ca 2 + permeable . Finally , the lateral gate and plug close again and the channel converts back to the idle state or ribosome - free state depending on whether the ribosome detaches from the translocon or not . While there is no evidence that Ca 2 + ions permeate through Sec61 translocons in the idle state [ 57 ] , functional studies in planar lipid bilayers demonstrated that Sec61 translocons support Ca 2 + leak in the post - translocation state but not in the translocating and ribosome - free states [ 51 , 57 , 61 ] . Another mechanism that might conceivably influence Ca 2 + leak from the ER , is the interaction of accessory factors with Sec61 complexes , such as chaperones or the ribosome . For example , reduced abundance of a constitutively expressed Sec61 - dependent ER chaperone such as BiP might conceivably induce a similar phenotype . We have previously shown that such proteins are depleted at the turnover rate [ 62 ] . However , numerous proteomics studies have not shown any loss of BiP even at 16 - 24 h [ 13 , 14 , Hall , Hsieh et al . , unpublished ] , even though transcription is reduced [ 14 ] . These observations are consistent with its slow turnover rate [ 63 ] , hence this is unlikely to be a major component of the explanation of Ca 2 + leak , especially at earlier timepoints , including our on - line experiments and at 1 h exposure . However , the breakdown of ER - associated polysomes to a single 80S peak hints at effects of mycolactone on this stage of translocation that may also contribute to the Ca 2 + leak . While translocation of secreted and Sec61 α - dependent single - pass membrane proteins is blocked by mycolactone [ 64 ] , many multi - pass membrane proteins are still being synthesised , not all of which are thought to be substrates of the ER membrane protein complex [ 65 ] . We found that monomeric ribosomes accumulate in cells treated with mycolactone , and these are still associated with Sec61 α . This scenario could be explained by altered conformation of the RNC complex delaying ribosome release following translation termination . Alternatively , the loss of the polysomes may slow the transition between the post - translocation and idle / ribosome - free states , allowing more time for Ca 2 + to leak out . Interestingly , this data is in line with a previously published study , which showed a similar effect in cells exposed to DTT or TG [ 66 ] . Like mycolactone , these compounds activate the integrated stress response pathways , and here the monosomal ribosomes continued to D o w n l oaded f r o m h tt p : / / po r t l andp r e ss . c o m / b i o c he m j / a r t i c l e - pd f / do i / 10 . 1042 / B C J 20210345 / 923964 / b c j - 2021 - 0345 . pd f b y gue s t on 20 N o v e m be r 2021 B i o c he m i c a l J ou r na l .

Moreover , it agrees with our docking analysis that suggests that mycolactone can form hydrogen bonds with residues of CL6 on Sec61 α , which interact directly with the ribosome . We speculate that the interaction of mycolactone with CL6 could change the conformation of these regions and consequently could alter the interaction and / or rate of release . This fits well with the changes in trypsin sensitivity of CL6 and CL7 observed by McKenna et al . ( 2016 ) . In summary , binding of mycolactone to Sec61 α is reminiscent of the “foot - in - the - door” mechanism suggested earlier for cotransin and eeyarestatin compounds [ 34 , 67 ] . By stabilising the translocon in an intermediate state that is barely permeable to Ca 2 + ions and / or altering the efficiency with which the Sec61 translocon can cycle through its various structural states , mycolactone promotes an enhanced Ca 2 + leak from the ER that likely underpins its cytotoxic effects .

Mycolactone attenuates the Ca 2 + mobilisation in HCT116 cells . Changes in cytosolic Ca 2 + ( [ Ca 2 + ] cyt ) were imaged with FURA - 2 . HCT116 cells were treated with 0 . 05 % DMSO or 125 ng / mL mycolactone ( MYC ) for 1 h ( A ) , 6 h ( B ) and 18 h ( C ) before FURA - 2 loading and Ca 2 + imaging . To avoid Ca 2 + entry into the cells , experiments were carried out in the absence of external Ca 2 + ( zero [ Ca 2 + ] ext ) . Thapsigargin ( 1 μ M TG ) was added to the bath solution to unmask Ca 2 + leak from ER ( A - C ) . The area under the curve ( AUC ) of the TG - induced Ca 2 + transients was used as a measure of the mobilisable Ca 2 + from intracellular TG - sensitive stores ( D ) . The total amount of intracellular mobilisable Ca 2 + was estimated by treating cells with ionomycin ( 10 μ M IONO ) ( E ) . The AUC of the IONO - induced Ca 2 + transients reflect the total amount of Ca 2 + that is stored within the cells ( F ) . The number of cells imaged in the experiments is given within the graph bars in D and F .

Dose - dependent effects of mycolactone on Ca 2 + mobilisation in HCT116 cells . The dose - dependence of mycolactone ( MYC ) on the thapsigarin ( TG ) - induced Ca 2 + mobilisation was analysed by exposing HCT116 cells to 0 . 05 % DMSO and to a dilution series of mycolactone from 3 . 9 nm / ml to 125 ng / ml for 6 h . Cytosolic Ca 2 + ( [ Ca 2 + ] cyt ) was imaged with FURA - 2 ( A ) . The area under the curve ( AUC ) was calculated from TG - induced Ca 2 + transients ( B ) .

Mycolactone enhances the Ca 2 + leak and induces Ca 2 + depletion in the ER . Changes of the Ca 2 + concentration in cytosol ( [ Ca 2 + ] cyt ) and ER ( [ Ca 2 + ] ER ) were imaged with FURA - 2 and with the FRET - based D1ER sensor , respectively . Changes in cytosolic and ER Ca 2 + are expressed as F340 / F380 and F Citrine / F CFP ratios . HEK - 293 cells expressing D1ER ( D1ER - HEK ) were exposed to mycolactone ( MYC ) “online” for 17 min while the Ca 2 + imaging experiment was running ( A , MYC 17 min , 125 ng / ml mycolactone ) .

In further experiments , D1ER - HEK cells were treated with mycolactone for 6 and 18 h before Ca 2 + imaging ( B , MYC 6 h , 100 ng / ml mycolactone ; C , MYC 18 h , 100 ng / ml mycolactone ) . DMSO 0 . 025 % was used as a control . Upper panels in A , B and C depict changes of ER Ca 2 + content ; lower panels show the corresponding transients in cytosolic Ca 2 + . Mycolactone and thapsigargin application protocols are depicted above graphs . The speed of TG - induced Ca 2 + depletion in ER was measured as the time that D1ER ratios needed to decrease to 50 % ( D , t 1 / 2 ) and AUC ( E ) was calculated for the Ca 2 + transients in cytosol . The number of cells is given within the graph bars in D and E . Data is presented as means ± SEM ; n . s . , non - significant ; * * * , p < 0 . 001 . Figure 4 . Mycolactone - resistant mutations in Sec61 α abolish the effects of mycolactone on the Ca 2 + leak from ER . The effects of mycolactone ( MYC ) on [ Ca 2 + ] ER were analysed in wild type HCT116 cells ( A , WT ) and in HCT116 cells containing point mutations in Sec61 α ( B , D60G ; C , R66K ; D , S71F ; E , S82Y ; F , Q127K ) . In order to image [ Ca 2 + ] ER , cells were transfected with the ER Ca 2 + sensor ER - GCaMP6 - 150 . Changes in [ Ca 2 + ] ER are given as normalised fluorescence ( F / F 0 ) . Cells were treated with 0 . 05 % DMSO or 125 ng / ml mycolactone for 6 h before Ca 2 + imaging . Thapsigargin ( 1 μ M TG ) was used to induce ER Ca 2 + depletion . Accordingly , the speed in the decrease of [ Ca 2 + ] ER is a measure of the Ca 2 + leak from ER and was calculated as the time to 50 % decrease in the normalised fluorescence F / F 0 ( G , t 1 / 2 ) . The number of cells is given within the graph bars in E . Data is presented as means ± SEM ; * , p < 0 . 05 ; * * * , p < 0 . 001 . Figure 5 .

Membrane - associated polysomes were isolated from semi - permeabilised cell extracts solubilised with 2 % digitonin and separated on a 10 - 60 % sucrose gradient as described in Material and Methods ( B ) . Proteins within column fractions , which correspond to those in the polysome profiles directly above , were acetone - precipitated and subject to SDS page and immunoblotting with anti - Sec61 α and anti - Sec61 β antibodies ( C ) . Figure representative of duplicate assays . Figure 8 . Mode of mycolactone action on the Ca 2 + homeostasis . Upon application in cellula , mycolactone ( MYC ) enhances gradually the Ca 2 + leak from ER and , as a consequence , there is a steady loss of Ca 2 + , which in turn reduces the ER Ca 2 + content with respect to controls ( A ) . Since the cytosolic TG - induced Ca 2 + are shaped by the ER Ca 2 + leak and ER Ca 2 + content , mycolactone reduces the amplitude and duration of these Ca 2 + transients in a time dependent manner . Shown are representative examples of TG - induced Ca 2 + transients recorded in HCT116 , D1ER - HEK and RAW 264 . 7 cells exposed to mycoalctone ( B , MYC ) . The exposure time is indicated next to each Ca 2 + transient ( black , DMSO controls ; red , mycolactone - treated cells ) . The time point of TG application is marked by an arrow . The dwindling of TG - induced Ca 2 + transients upon application of mycolactone is recapitulated in HCT116 cells treated with the reference Ca 2 + leak enhancer trifluoperazine ( B , TFP . Black , DMSO controls ; blue , TFP - treated cells ) .

In normal translocation , idle translocons are engaged with ribosome nascent chain complexes , but co - translational translocation has not yet started . There is no evidence that idle translocons are Ca 2 + permeable . Translocons “breathe” along the lateral gate , rapidly transitioning between the idle and intermediate states . We propose that the intermediate state may become transiently Ca 2 + permeable due to its open structure and the partial displacement of the plug helix . Once the signal peptide of the nascent chain functionally engages with the lateral gate of Sec61 α , the protein - conducting channel facilitates the translocation of the nascent protein by complete unfolding of the plug into a disordered state , but the translocating state is not permeable to Ca 2 + due to the peptide filling the resultant channel . After translocation , Sec61 complexes transiently remain in this fully open post - translocation state , but without a nascent chain , allowing Ca 2 + ions to permeate through the aqueous channel . The cycle is completed when the ribosomes de - attach and Sec61 complexes return to the ribosome - fre e or idle state , depending on whether the ribosome is released . Mycolactone traps translocons in an inhibited state , that resembles the intermediate state , but may also be able to bind Sec61 α in the idle state . This locks the Sec61 translocon in a Ca 2 + - permeable conformation and an inefficient cycling through the other states , resulting in enhanced Ca 2 + leak from the ER . Mycolactone causes an increase in membrane - associated 80S ribosomal monosomes . Hence , another contributing factor to the enhanced Ca 2 + leak could be sustained dwell time in the post - translocation state , due to decreased efficiency of ribosome release .
