Methods : Serology assays from Roche , Abbott , Diasorin , BioMerieux , Beckman - Coulter , Siemens , and Mt . - Sinai ELISA were included . Negative samples from 2391 individuals representative of the Israeli population , and 698 SARS - CoV - 2 PCR positive patients , collected between March and May 2020 , were analyzed Findings : Immunoassays sensitivities between 81 . 5 % - 89 . 4 % and speci ﬁ cities between 97 . 7 % - 100 % resulted in a profound impact on the expected Positive Predictive Value ( PPV ) in low ( < 15 % ) prevalence scenarios . No meaningful increase was detected in the false positive rate in children compared to adults . A positive correlation between disease severity and antibody titers , and no decrease in antibody titers in the ﬁ rst 8 weeks after PCR positivity was observed . We identi ﬁ ed a subgroup of symptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 positive patients ( ~ 5 % of patients ) , who remained seronegative across a wide range of antigens , isotypes , and technologies . Interpretation : wThe commercially available automated immunoassays exhibit signi ﬁ cant differences in performance and expected PPV in low prevalence scenarios . The low false - positivity rate in under 20 0 s sug - gests that cross - reactive immunity from previous CoV strains is unlikely to explain the milder disease course in children . Finding no decrease in antibody titers in the ﬁ rst 8 weeks is in contrast to some reports of short half - life for SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies .

Evidence before this study Serological assays are critical for identifying individuals who were previously infected with SARS - CoV - 2 . Most large diagnostic compa - nies have developed automated high - throughput serology testing that allow monitoring of disease dynamics , identifying hot spots of infections , assessing herd immunity , and , in the future , will allow determining vaccination status . A literature search performed from March 1st up to Aug 20 , 2020 , showed that studies have been limited in the number of assays compared and the power and heterogeneity of the samples used , including small cohorts , lack of pediatric sam - ples , gender biases , and disease severity biases . 1 . 2 . Added value of this study We found signi ﬁ cant performance differences with major impact on PPV values in low prevalence scenarios . Additionally , we did not ﬁ nd evidence for prior cross - reactive immunity among children by past exposure to other corona strains . Our ﬁ ndings substantiate the correlation between antibody titers and disease severity and contra - dict evidence for decreased titers with time and short half - life . Finally , we found that roughly 1 out of 20 SARS - CoV - 2 positive patients , did not seroconvert . 1 . 3 . Implications of all the available evidence The assay of choice for epidemiological assessments and diagnosis should be determined separately in each country and be based on the prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 . Our results , together with previous evi - dence , suggest that antibody levels are maintained for at least 2 months , and are correlated with disease severity and hospitalization , suggesting that disease severity is not attributed to ineffective immune response . About 5 % of the investigated population did not develop antibodies following SARS - CoV - 2 infection , which puts a higher bound on the maximal serology sensitivity , and vaccine ef ﬁ - cacy ( ~ 95 % ) . 2 . Introduction Numerous serology assays have been developed for SARS - CoV - 2 with considerable variation in underlying technology , ease of use , cost , and performance [ 1 ] . Clearly , accurate and scalable testing pro - cedures are critical for achieving control over the current pandemic . Serological assays are the only measure to identify individuals who were previously infected with SARS - CoV - 2 . As such , they allow gov - ernments and large health organizations to continuously monitor disease dynamics , identify hot spots of infections , assess herd immu - nity , and better utilize resources . During the ﬁ rst and second quarter of 2020 , most of the large diagnostics companies released their auto - mated serology testing version to the market , mostly via the Emer - gency Use Authorization ( EUA ) FDA route [ 2 ] . A few comparisons between different assays have been published ; however , most are limited in the number of assays compared and the power and hetero - geneity of the samples used , including small cohorts , lack of pediatric samples , gender biases , disease severity biases etc . [ 3 (cid:1) 5 ] . Therefore , a population - based validation was necessary to assess the actual per - formance of the different assays on the target population . The Israeli Ministry of Health ( MOH ) established a national serology validation taskforce to validate and assess the performance of several assays in a nationwide , powered , and methodological manner [ 6 ] Our goals for the study were to 1 ) validate and compare the per - formance of the different assays : despite declared performance of the different assays by the legal manufacturers , no external validation was performed due to the high urgency in launching these products . Of note , speci ﬁ city in serological assays might differ between geogra - phies , due to cross reactivity with background pathogens that might be more , or less prevalent in a speci ﬁ c territory . For example , Dengue was recently shown to have cross - reactivity with SARS - CoV - 2 [ 7 ] and therefore endemic regions , might present higher false positive rates than other territories where this pathogen is less prevalent . 2 ) To assess the speci ﬁ city in a large representative cohort of the target population and predict the Positive Predictive Value ( PPV ) under dif - ferent prevalence scenarios : PPV is known to be highly sensitive to low prevalence and was shown in many cases , for example cancer screening , to diminish the overall utility of a diagnostic test due to the high ratio of false to true positive results [ 8 ] . The main parame - ters that determine the PPV are prevalence and speci ﬁ city , and due to the relatively limited prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 exposure we wanted to quantify the PPV for each kit under low prevalence scenar - ios ( < 15 % ) . The very slow increase in prevalence levels since the SARS - CoV - 2 outbreak suggests that these low prevalence conditions are expected to remain until a wide and effective vaccination will be applied . 3 ) To assess the correlation between disease severity and antibody titers including titer decay : it was previously shown that antibody titers are correlated with disease severity [ 9 , 10 ] ; however , some reports suggested that these titers rapidly decay and that the half - life time of SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies is short [ 11 ] . If correct , such a behavior can signi ﬁ cantly impact the creation of herd immunity and the probability for re - infection among previously exposed individu - als . It might also have potential impact on the expected ef ﬁ cacy of vaccination and is therefore important to quantify in a population - wide manner . 4 ) To assess the proportion and characteristics of the patients who had no seroconversion (cid:2) 14 days from positive PCR ( “ seronegative non - responders ” ) : recent reports on seroconversion were all based on limited sample size , limited number of assays in use ( usually one ) and thus created con ﬂ icting results , with some studies assessing no seronegative patients after 14 (cid:1) 21 days [ 12 ] , and others suggesting that the proportion of non - responding seronega - tive patients is over 20 % [ 11 ] . Quantifying this sub - population is especially important due to its impact on herd immunity , potential vaccination ef ﬁ cacy , and psychological impact on the public . 3 . Methods 3 . 1 . Study design The Israeli SARS - CoV - 2 National Serology Validation Plan is based on a validation protocol ( Supplementary Annx . 1 ) . The diagnostic lab - oratories of all four Health Maintenance Organizations ( HMOs ) in Israel (cid:1) Clalit , Maccabi , Leumit and Meuhedet and the Central Virol - ogy Laboratory ( CVL ) of the Ministry of Health ( MOH ) , participated in the study which was designed and executed during March - July 2020 . Each lab obtained and tested serum samples from different cohorts of non - SARS - CoV - 2 and SARS - CoV - 2 patients collected from all regions in Israel . The numbers of positive and negative samples tested in each laboratory are shown in Table 1 .

Patients and samples Overall 3089 samples , one per individual , were included ; 2391 sera samples were collected prior to September 2019 and were con - sidered SARS - CoV - 2 negative samples , and 698 sera obtained between March 28th and May 24th , 2020 from individuals with a positive SARS - CoV - 2 qRT - PCR sampled by nose / throat swab were considered positive samples . The overall distributions of age and other patient characteristics are shown in Table 1 . Among the posi - tives , 110 sera were collected less than 14 days , and 588 , 14 or more days after the ﬁ rst positive PCR result . 3 . 3 . Serology testing Samples were tested using the following commercially available automated immunoassays according to manufacturer ’ s instructions : ARCHITECT SARS - CoV - 2 N IgG Immunoassay ( Abbot , Illinois , U . S . A ) , LIAISON (cid:1) SARS - CoV - 2 S1 / S2 IgG ( Diasorin , Saluggia , Italy ) , Elecsys (cid:1) N Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 ( Roche , Mannheim , Germany ) , VIDAS (cid:1) SARS - COV - 2 RBD IgG ( BioM (cid:1) erieux , Marcy - l ’ Etoile , France ) , Siemens SARS - CoV - 2 RBD Total ( COV2T ) ( Siemens , NY , USA ) and Access SARS - CoV - 2 RBD IgG assay ( Beckman - Coulter , CA , U . S . A . ) . ELISA was performed using the Mount Sinai Hospital Clinical Laboratory SARS - CoV - 2 IgG Anti - body Test [ 13 ] which was modi ﬁ ed accordingly : a 96 well microtiter Polysorb plate ( Nunc , Thermo , Denmark ) coated overnight with 1ug / ml of Receptor Binding Domain ( RBD ) antigen was blocked with 5 % skimmed milk at 25 °C for 60 min and human serum samples ( diluted 1 : 100 with 3 % skimmed milk ) were added to antigen coated wells . Following incubation at 25 °C for 120 min and incubation for 60 min after the addition of goat anti - human IgG horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) conjugate ( Jackson ImmunoResearch , PA , USA ) , Tetramethyl - benzidine substrate ( TMB ) substrate was added followed by stop solution ( 1 M HCl ) and the OD of each well was measured at 450 nm . ELISA index value below 0 . 9 was considered negative , between 0 . 9 and 1 . 1 , equivocal and equal or above 1 . 1 , positive . Supplementary Table 1 shows the antigen used in each assay for antibody detection . 3 . 4 . Statistical methods Speci ﬁ city and sensitivity for each serological test were estimated as the proportion of correct results in the negative cohort and the PCR positive (cid:2) 14 day cohort respectively . Equivocal results ( occur - ring with Diasorin and ELISA tests ) were excluded from the calcula - tion . Con ﬁ dence intervals were based on inverting the test based on the binomial distribution . Positive predictive values ( the probability that a person testing positive actually has the disease ) and their 95 % credible intervals were estimated using Bayesian methods , assuming independent Table 1 Baseline cohort characteristics .

The motiva - tion for Bayesian methods was to avoid over - interpretation of results showing 100 % speci ﬁ city ( leading to 100 % positive predictive value ) based on ﬁ nite samples . The Bayesian methods provide a more realis - tic estimate in such circumstances [ 14 ] . Optimal cut - off points were calculated based on minimizing the expected number of mistaken diagnoses for a given prevalence of dis - ease . Con ﬁ dence limits for the optimal cut - off points were calculated using the bootstrap percentile method [ 15 ] , and the estimated num - ber of mistakes was adjusted using 10 - fold cross - validation . The association between titer value and severity of disease , hospi - talization and age was assessed using non - parametric methods ( the Cuzick trend test [ 16 ] for age and severity of disease , and the Mann - Whitney test for hospitalization ) . The analysis of the association between titer value and the time from the positive PCR test included also those patients who were assessed less than 14d after the PCR test . The association was assessed using restricted cubic splines ( 5 knots placed at the 10th , 25th , 50th , 75th and 90th percentiles ) . Com - paring characteristics of seronegative patients with those of seroposi - tive patients was performed suing Fisher ’ s exact test , the choice for comparisons of proportions based on small numbers . Analyses were performed using the statistical software program SAS 9 . 4 ( SAS Insti - tute , Cary , NC , 2012 ) . 3 . 5 .

The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had ﬁ nal responsibility for the decision to submit for publication . 4 . Results 4 . 1 . Cohort characteristics and assays tested We validated the performance of six commercially available auto - mated IgG / total antibody serology products for SARS - CoV - 2 and one ELISA format , including the Roche Cobas Total Ig ( Roche ) , Abbott SARS - CoV - 2 IgG ( Abbott ) , BioMerieux VIDAS IgG ( VIDAS IgG ) , Beck - man Coulter Access IgG ( Beckman ) , Siemens ADVIA IgG ( Siemens ) , Diasorin Liaison IgG ( Diasorin ) and the RBD ELISA assay of Mt . Sinai ( ELISA , see Supplementary Table 1 ) . The study work ﬂ ow based on the STARD guidelines is described in Fig . 1 and the cohort characteris - tics are detailed in Table 1 . The varying numbers of samples per kit occurred from our focus on the Abbott and Diasorin kits that were due to be used in a national serological survey in Israel . Other kits were added according to the capacity of the individual laboratories and the volume of the blood samples . Assessing the sensitivity and speci ﬁ city of the different assays revealed seemingly small gaps in speci ﬁ city and more substantial gaps in sensitivity . The performance of each assay , sensitivity and speci ﬁ city , with their corresponding con ﬁ dence interval ( CI ) , are shown in Table 2 and included 2391 neg - ative and 588 positive samples collected (cid:2) 14 days after a positive PCR . The age distribution of the control ( negative ) cohort re ﬂ ects the general population age distribution in the state of Israel and included a large proportion of pediatric and adolescent populations ( aged < 20 years ) , composing 28 . 8 % of the cohort ( n = 688 ) and the gender distri - bution was 1 : 1 ( M : F 43 . 4 : 56 . 6 % ) . 4 . 2 . Assays performance We calculated the sensitivity , speci ﬁ city and the 95 % con ﬁ dence intervals for each one of the tested assays . Equivocal zone results , which were de ﬁ ned for the Diasorin ( n = 28 ) and the ELISA format ( n = 20 ) , were not included in the calculation of sensitivity and speci - ﬁ city , although the FDA ’ s approach is to use such results as false neg - ative for sensitivity calculation and false positive for speci ﬁ city calculation , which is expected to lower our reported results ( https : / / open . fda . gov / apis / device / covid19serology / ) ( see Table 2 ) . The best performing kits in terms of sensitivity were the ELISA with 89 . 4 % ( CI 85 . 4 (cid:1) 92 . 3 ) , the VIDAS IgG with 89 . 3 % ( CI 85 . 5 (cid:1) 92 . 1 ) , and the Roche , with 89 . 0 % ( CI 85 . 9 (cid:1) 91 . 4 ) . The best performing kits in terms of speci - ﬁ city were the Roche with 100 % ( CI 99 . 8 (cid:1) 100 ) , Beckman with 100 % ( CI 98 . 8 (cid:1) 100 ) , and the Siemens with 99 . 8 % ( CI 98 . 7 (cid:1) 99 . 94 ) , although Fig . 1 .

Oved et al . / EClinicalMedicine 00 ( 2020 ) 100651 the latter two results were based on substantially smaller numbers (cid:1) note the wider con ﬁ dence limits . The lowest performance was shown by the Diasorin assay that despite having 28 equivocal results in both groups ( 0 . 3 % of the negative and 4 % of the positive samples ) showed 82 . 4 % sensitivity ( CI 79 . 0 (cid:1) 85 . 3 ) and 98 . 7 % speci ﬁ city ( CI 98 . 2 (cid:1) 99 . 1 ) . Another kit with low sensitivity despite high speci ﬁ city was the Beck - man ( 81 . 5 % sensitivity ( CI 74 . 6 (cid:1) 86 . 6 ) and 100 % speci ﬁ city ( CI 98 . 8 (cid:1) 100 ) ( see Table 2 ) . 4 . 3 . Speci ﬁ city in children Since it was suggested that protective immunity in children might partially be due to cross - reactive immunity to past Coronavirus strains [ 17 ] we speci ﬁ cally investigated the speci ﬁ city in children and adoles - cents under 20 years ( 688 samples which compose 28 . 7 % of our SARS - CoV - 2 negative cohort ) . Results show that speci ﬁ city in children and adolescents were similar to those overall : Abbott 99 . 7 % ( 642 / 644 : CI 98 . 9 (cid:1) 99 . 9 ) , Diasorin 98 . 0 % ( 633 / 646 : CI 96 . 6 (cid:1) 98 . 8 ) , Vidas VIDAS IgG 97 . 4 % ( 330 / 339 : CI 95 . 0 (cid:1) 98 . 6 ) , Roche 100 % ( 367 / 367 : CI 99 . 0 (cid:1) 100 . 0 ) , ELISA 98 . 6 % ( 351 / 356 : CI 96 . 8 (cid:1) 99 . 4 ) , Beckman 100 % ( 12 / 12 : CI 73 . 5 (cid:1) 100 . 0 ) and Siemens 100 % ( 20 / 20 : CI 83 . 2 (cid:1) 100 . 0 ) . 4 . 4 . Seemingly narrow differences in speci ﬁ city demonstrate profound effect on PPV in low prevalence scenarios Despite the seemingly narrow differences in speci ﬁ city , we cal - culated the effect of these differences on the Positive Predictive Val - ues ( PPV ) of each assay , in prevalence scenarios lower than 15 % . Such prevalence is expected in most territories , until an effective and wide vaccination program will be applied [ 18 ] . The assays ’ PPV were profoundly different and could reach up to 4 - fold in PPV per - formance . Out of the commercial kits , Roche exhibited the best PPV curve with up to 88 % [ 95 % credible interval ( CRI ) 65 (cid:1) 99 . 6 ] PPV in 0 . 5 % prevalence while Diasorin demonstrated the poorest with 25 % ( CRI 19 (cid:1) 32 ) PPV under the same conditions . The different perfor - mance in PPV was clear up until roughly 15 % prevalence where the gaps in PPV diminished and all assays clustered into a narrow 15 % ribbon ( See Fig . 2 ) . We then turned to determine for each kit the optimal cutoff value that optimizes total accuracy in different preva - lence scenarios , using 10 % cross validation .

Antibody titers do not decay during the ﬁ rst 8 weeks after exposure , and are correlated with disease severity We recorded the antibody titer of each sample and examined the correlation between antibody titer and different cohort characteristics . First , we compared the titers over time in the ﬁ rst 8 weeks after a positive PCR result for all samples with known dates post PCR test result . Such analysis of samples from multiple patients that were taken at different time points yielded an “ averaged ” tem - poral dynamics pattern . Despite some previous reports on antibody Fig . 3 .

The kits that presented stable lev - els of antibodies between 2 and 8 weeks were the Abbott , VIDAS IgG , ELISA and Beckman while increased antibody titers were observed in the Roche , Siemens , and Diasorin assays ( See Fig . 3 ) . Importantly , the antibody titer did not vary with the type of antigen used . Subse - quently , we analyzed the correlation between the assay titers and disease severity . As previously reported [ 12 ] , we found the titers in Abbott , Diasorin , VIDAS IgG and ELISA to be signi ﬁ cantly positively correlated while titers in Beckman and Siemens showed a trend for positive correlation with disease severity between asymptomatic to mild to moderate / severe patients . Similarly , we also observed signi ﬁ - cantly higher titers in hospitalized versus non - hospitalized patients ( see Table 3 ) in Abbott , Diasorin , VIDAS IgG and ELISA immonoassays . 4 . 6 . Roughly 1 out of 20 PCR positive patients remains seronegative despite testing with multiple assays and antigens Some of the PCR positive SARS - CoV - 2 patients that we tested were consistently seronegative despite applying various commer - cially available assays that utilized different antigens , and different isotypes ( IgG or total antibody ) .

We found the propor - tion of this subpopulation to be 4 . 7 % of the symptomatic PCR positive patients with blood collection 14 or more days after the positive PCR result . If we loosen the criteria and take into account patients that were negative in 3 or more different assays , the proportion increases to 6 . 5 % ( See Table 4 ) . We then compared the seronegative subpopula - tion against the seropositive patients to search for potential unique characteristics , but found no clear differences in age , hospitalization , disease severity , time from positive PCR and gender ( see Table 5 ) , although numbers are too small to rule out such differences . This measurement represents the ﬁ rst population - wide estimate using multiple commercially available tests and different antigens to quan - tify the proportion of seronegative non - responding patients at risk for re - infection . 5 . Discussion This study was designed and executed during March - July 2020 by the national serology validation taskforce , to test the performance and limitations of multiple commercially available automated immu - noassay kits . During normal days , a validation process of such magni - tude is not required due to the rigorous methodologies and approval process that are being applied by the FDA in approving in - vitro diag - nostics ( IVD ) . These regulatory processes , preceded by meticulous work of highly experienced teams within the large IVD companies , allow the end users in labs across the world to be con ﬁ dent in the performance declared by each vendor . During the SARS - CoV - 2 pan - demic , an urgent need for testing emerged , which had to be satis ﬁ ed according to an extremely challenging timeline never previously required . This was exacerbated by the lack of suf ﬁ cient samples to support veri ﬁ cation and validation . The FDA approved an emergency use authorization process ( EUA ) , which was necessary , yet , lacked the rigor of the classical procedures and thus decreased con ﬁ dence in assays ’ performance [ 2 ] . Indeed , many kits with EUA were later retracted by the vendors or banned by the FDA due to diminished performance [ 19 ] . The state of Israel , like numerous other countries , signed supply contracts with multiple IVD vendors to get access to diagnostic testing once launched [ 20 ] . To ﬁ ll the performance gap , a national team of experts with a wide range of expertise was established , to methodologically evaluate the performance of the different kits ( see protocol as Supplementary Annex . 1 ) . The team included experts in virology , clinical chemistry , immunology , IVD development and validation , and biostatisticians , from various sectors including industry , government , HMOs , and public and private research institutes . The work was split between ﬁ ve labs and included testing the serology assays manufactured by Roche , Abbott , BioMerieux , Beckman Coulter , Siemens , and Mt . Sinai ELISA . We tested 2391 negative samples that were collected prior to September 2019 , aged 0 (cid:1) 103y that closely represented the distribu - tion of ages within the general population and resembles a unique cohort due to the large number of pediatric samples composed of 222 ( 9 . 3 % ) , 149 ( 6 . 2 % ) and 317 ( 13 . 2 % ) samples from children and adolescent age 0 (cid:1) 6 . 6 (cid:1) 10 and 11 (cid:1) 20 years old , respectively . Since seasonal Human Coronavirus ( HCoVs ) infections is prevalent in Israel with more than 10 % of In ﬂ uenza - like illness molecularly diagnosed annually as HCoVs [ 21 ] and antibodies against HCoVs are widespread in human sera [ 22 ] cross - reactivity with HCoVs antibodies should have been recognized by evaluating antibodies against SARS - CoV - 2 in the Israeli non - COVID - 19 population tested in this study . In light of the mild disease course in children , where less than 1 % of infected cases were < 10 years and ~ 3 . 5 % of SARS - CoV - 2 infected children had lymphocytopenia [ 23 ] , one hypothesis suggested that protective immunity in children might partially be due to cross - reactive immu - nity to past Coronavirus strains . Our measurements of the negative cohort did not yield signi ﬁ cantly more false positive results in the pediatric versus adult population , thus largely excluding this hypoth - esis . The positive cohort that we tested included 698 SARS - CoV - 2 PCR positive patients with different degrees of severity , time from positive PCR result , age etc . The 588 samples obtained (cid:2) 14 days after ﬁ rst positive PCR allowed evaluation of the true sensitivity of the dif - ferent kits in comparison to other studies examining speci ﬁ c assays and smaller cohorts [ 3 , 4 ] . All samples were collected between March 28th and May 24th , 2020 . A comparison of the seven assays revealed a range of sensitivities and speci ﬁ cities , where some of these , devi - ated from the declared performance in the product inserts published in the FDA EUA ( https : / / www . fda . gov / medical - devices / emergency - situations - medical - devices / emergency - use - authorizations - medical - devices ) . The most sensitive commercially available kits were Roche and VIDAS IgG , while the least sensitive were Diasorin and Beckman . Despite the seemingly narrow differences in speci ﬁ city , the impact of such differences on PPV in low prevalence settings can be dramatic . The global prevalence of previous exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 mostly vary between 0 and 5 % [ 24 , 25 ] . These relatively low numbers are not expected to signi ﬁ cantly increase , considering the social distancing measures that are being taken , until a successful immunization will be widely applied [ 18 ] . We therefore estimated the PPV of each assay under the different prevalence scenarios ranging between 0 . 5 (cid:1) 15 % and were able to show profound differences as high as 4 - fold between different diagnostic products . Such differences might impact the assay of choice for epidemiological assessments , or alternatively , must be factored in , while performing such studies . Importantly , we are aware of assays that were evaluated by our colleagues around the globe reporting real world data of 80 % speci ﬁ city or less , especially for lateral ﬂ ow rapid assays , like the ones that were purchased by the UK government [ 26 ] . Such performance represents 5 % PPV in a 1 % prevalence scenario , which makes these tests a poor alternative for epidemiological studies and might cause unnecessary psychological distress for patients . We then analyzed the factors that correlated with antibody titers among different patients . A few groups suggested that the half - life time of antibodies to certain SARS - CoV - 2 proteins might be as low as 8 weeks , and might re ﬂ ect a risk to lose protective immunity [ 27 ] and to potentially underestimate the number of infected individu - als . We therefore analyzed the average antibody titer levels among individuals that were sampled at different time points after positive PCR results . Such analysis , although lacking the antibody titer dynamics of a certain individual , is more representative of the over - all antibody response behavior within a wide population . Since we used 7 different assays and different patients for each time point , we could factor out elements such as antigen differences , assay per - formance , and inter - patient variability . The patterns we observed showed a stable antibody titer after 14 days and up to 8 weeks after positive PCR , in 4 out of 7 kits ( Abbott , VIDAS IgG , ELISA and Beck - man ) while in 3 out of 7 kits , the Roche , Siemens , and Diasorin we observed an increase in titers up to 8 weeks post infection . These results contradict previous reports that suggested a short half - life of SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies [ 27 ] and support long - term immunity after infection as was shown in other studies [ 28 ] . In addition , we observed strong correlation between antibody titers and disease severity . In 4 kits ( Abbott , Diasorin , VIDAS IgG and the ELISA ) , the titers showed a signi ﬁ cant increase from asymptomatic to mild to moderate / severe cases , while in 2 other kits ( Beckman and Siemens ) this increase did not reach statistical signi ﬁ cance . Accordingly , a similar pattern of higher titers in hospitalized compared with non - hospitalized patients was detected , further supporting this observa - tion . Interestingly , only Roche , which detects total Ig against the N antigen , demonstrated no difference in titer levels between severe and non (cid:1) severe cases but a titer increase over time . The differences in antibody titers , kinetics and correlation with disease severity observed among the immunoassays tested here may re ﬂ ect hetero - geneity of antibodies against N , S and RBD antigens [ 29 ] , cumulative ARTICLE IN PRESS JID : ECLINM [ m5G ; November 19 , 2020 ; 6 : 55 ] Please cite this article as : K .

Future studies should investigate the long - term kinetics of antibodies against each anti - gen , the correlation with neutralization capacity and the overall prognostic value of each assay . Overall , these data suggest that an ineffective humoral response is not a potential reason for severe disease More investigation is needed to understand whether increased antibody production is the cause or the effect of more severe disease . After measuring the serological response among 588 / 698 PCR positive patients , who were tested (cid:2) 14 days post infection , we observed one speci ﬁ c subpopulation of patients who remained sero - negative despite repeated testing with different assays utilizing dif - ferent antigens , isotypes , and methods . Previous anecdotal reports about this phenomenon were con ﬂ icting , ranging between no sero - negative patients [ 12 ] , to over 20 % [ 11 ] . Our ﬁ ndings suggest that the number is about 1 out of 20 patients , with 4 . 7 % being negative in 4 or more tests , and 6 . 5 % in 3 or more tests . We did not ﬁ nd any clear cor - relation between seronegative non - responders and age , gender , time from positive PCR , disease severity or hospitalization , although the number of seronegative persons is small . To the best of our knowl - edge , this is the ﬁ rst multi - test , multi - antigen , population - wide quanti ﬁ cation of seronegative patients that can support the real mag - nitude of this problem . No seroconversion , and the potential for re - infection among individuals is attracting signi ﬁ cant media and public concerns and also potentially impacts herd immunity and the burden on the healthcare system . Our ﬁ ndings suggest that approximately 5 % of patients fall into this category and their impact on herd immu - nity or the healthcare system is expected to be limited ; yet , these individuals are at increased risk for re - infection . Indeed , in recent study of the ﬁ rst characterized de ﬁ nite SARS - CoV - 2 re - infection case , no antibody response was found after the ﬁ rst infection episode [ 31 ] . As T cells also play an important role in immunity to SARS - CoV - 2 [ 32 ] and may be responsible for protection against re - infection despite lack of antibodies against SARS - CoV - 2 , further studies are required to better identify this subpopulation in order to effectively protect it . Seronegative non - responders are also expected at a certain propor - tion after immunization and the proportion of vaccine non - respond - ers was traditionally higher than the natural disease itself [ 33 ] . According to the data presented here within the Israeli population , we therefore estimate that the proportion of vaccination failure may be higher than 5 % regardless of the vaccine identity . Despite the unprecedented high numbers of samples and assays that were tested in this study of both SARS - CoV - 2 positive and nega - tive individuals , a limitation of this study is that not all assays were tested with all the samples , due to insuf ﬁ cient sample volume and that no longitudinal sera were analyzed for the antibody titer pro ﬁ les over time . Nevertheless , our dataset was large enough to draw statis - tically solid conclusions regarding performance and antibody kinet - ics . In addition , since most SARS - CoV - 2 cases in the general population are mild , our “ all comers ” cohort is mostly composed of mild infections and has a lower proportion of moderate and severe cases , despite their higher clinical importance . Finally , all the samples tested here were obtained within the Israeli population . It is possible that different background immunity status across geographical regions may impact the speci ﬁ city and sensitivity of immunoassays and therefore other large scale studies from different regions of the world are urgently needed . In summary , we performed a nationwide validation process for seven commercially available automated serology testing and found signi ﬁ cant performance differences with major impact on PPV values in low prevalence scenarios . In addition , we were able to largely exclude prior cross - reactive immunity among children by past expo - sure to other corona strains . Our ﬁ ndings support correlation between antibody titers and disease severity and contradict evidence for decreased titers with time and short half - life . We quantify in a population - wide , multi - assay fashion , the number of seronegative , non - responding patients at risk for re - infection and estimate that to be roughly 5 % . 6 .
