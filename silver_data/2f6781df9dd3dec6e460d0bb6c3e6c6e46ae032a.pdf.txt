DOI 10 . 1002 / jps . 24291 ABSTRACT : To combine the advantage of poly ( ethylene gylcol ) ( PEG ) for longer circulation and cell - penetrating peptides ( CPPs ) for efﬁcient cellular uptake , paclitaxel ( PTX ) - loaded liposomes functionalized with TAT , the most frequently used CPP , and cleavable PEG via a redox - responsive disulﬁde linker ( PTX - C - TAT - LP ) were successfully developed here . Under physiological conditions , TAT was shielded by PEG layer and liposomes exhibited a long blood circulation . At tumor site , PEG could be detached in the presence of exogenous reducing agent [ glutathione ( GSH ) ] and TAT was exposed to facilitate cell internalization . In the presence of GSH , the liposomal vesicle C - TAT - LP showed increased cellular uptake and improved three - dimensional tumor spheroids penetration in vitro compared with analogous stable shielded liposomes . C - TAT - LP achieved enhanced tumor distribution and demonstrated superior delivery efﬁciency in vivo . PTX - C - TAT - LP with GSH strongly inhibited the proliferation of murine melanoma B16F1 tumor cells in vitro and in vivo with the tumor inhibition rate being 69 . 4 % on B16F1 - bearing mice . In addition , the serum aspartate transaminase level , alanine transaminase level , and creatine kinase level were almost completely within normal range in the PTX - C - TAT - LP with GSH group , revealing PTX - C - TAT - LP with GSH had no obvious drug - related adverse events for liver and heart . Taken together , C - TAT - LP is a promising tumor - targeting drug carrier .

Liposomes have shown promising re - sults in clinical and preclinical studies such as Doxil 8 and DaunoXome , 9 owing to their good biocompatibility , ease of syn - thesis , and tailor - made features speciﬁc for drug delivery . Liposomes may be recognized and quickly cleared by the reticuloendothelial system ( RES ) . 10 PEGylation is a successful strategy to reduce the rate of RES uptake , increase circula - tion half - times 11 , 12 for tumor targeting based on the enhanced permeability and retention ( EPR ) effect . However , PEGylation strongly inhibits cellular uptake and lysosomal escape , 13 lead - ing to decreased therapeutic activity . 14 To enhance the cellular Abbreviations used : EPR , enhanced permeability and retention ; PEG , poly ( ethylene glycol ) ; CPPs , cell - penetrating peptides ; PTX , paclitaxel ; GSH , glutathione ; WBC , white blood cell ; RBC , red blood cell ; PLT , platelets ; MPV , mean platelet volume ; CK , creatine kinase ; AST , serum aspartate transaminase ; ALT , alanine transaminase ; BUN , urea nitrogen ; CREA , creatinine .

Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Vol . 103 , 1160 – 1173 ( 2015 ) C (cid:2) 2014 Wiley Periodicals , Inc . and the American Pharmacists Association uptake efﬁcacy , one improved strategy is introduction of cell - penetrating peptides ( CPPs ) , which are short peptides of less than 30 amino acids with the ability to translocate across the plasma membrane and deliver the different nanocarriers into cells . 15 TAT , the most frequently used CPP , has been widely em - ployed to facilitate internalization of liposomes into a variety of cells . Unfortunately , for intravenous ( ly ) ( i . v . ) injection , CPP - decorated liposomes may interact with non - targeted tissues and serum components , 16 causing signiﬁcant toxicity , reducing circulation time , and targeting ability . 17 The balance between in vivo stealth circulation and speciﬁc tumor targeting is difﬁcult to achieve by screening the density of CPPs and poly ( ethylene glycol ) ( PEG ) chain lengths . 18 To overcome the drawbacks , redox - responsive shielding of CPP - decorated liposomes with PEG has been widely studied for improved blood persistence , while preserving their transmembrane capability . 19 , 20 The func - tions of CPPs were “shielded” by long cleavable PEG coat while in circulation . In response to changes in reductive potential 21 at tumor site , PEG - detachment through the conformational changes of disulﬁde linkages allows for the activation of cell internalization and lysosomal escape . Paclitaxel ( PTX ) is one of the most popular chemotherapeu - tic agents used nowadays for treatment of ovarian , breast , and non - small cell lung cancers . 22 , 23 PTX binds to $ - tubulin , inhibits microtubule depolymerization , and arrests cycling cells in M ( mitotic ) phase , leading to mitotic arrest and apoptosis in di - viding cells . 24 , 25 However , its clinical application is complicated by its low water solubility and off - target toxicity . 26 PTX is not soluble in water and is prepared in Cremophor and dehydrated 1160 Fu et al . , JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES 103 : 1160 – 1173 , 2015 RESEARCH ARTICLE – Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology 1161 alcohol for use . The major hypersensitivity reactions are mainly caused by Cremophor in the formulation . 27 , 28 In these years , several novel drug delivery systems have been employed to by - pass the present limitation such as microemulsion , micelles , liposomes , and nanoparticles . 29 In our previous study , thiolytic cleavable PEG ( DSPE - S - S - PEG 5000 ) was synthesized via a disulﬁde bridge and used for pegylation of TAT ( DSPE - PEG - TAT ) - decorated liposomes ( C - TAT - LP ) . 30 , 31 Under physiological conditions , the cleavable PEG layer maximized the accumulation of liposomes in tumor tissue via EPR effect . At tumor site , PEG layer was removed by addition of exogenous glutathione ( GSH ) and TAT was re - stored , enabling liposomes a fast cellular uptake . Under the exogenous reduction - stimulus , the detachment of PEG could be switched on or off at will without raising the complexity of control and the triggered - response behavior did not depend en - tirely on the speciﬁc physiological conditions . Furthermore , the chain length of DSPE - PEG - TAT and the density of DSPE - S - S - PEG 5000 were screened by in vitro cellular uptake experiment , ﬂuorescent dye leakage test in serum , and pharmacokinetic studies of liposomes in vivo . Results showed liposomes con - taining DSPE - PEG 2000 - TAT ( the mole percentage was 0 . 5 % ) as inner layer could be nearly fully shielded by DSPE - S - S - PEG 5000 ( the mole percentage was 10 % ) as outer layer and they exhib - ited longer blood circulation time with the lower leakage rate of ﬂuorescent dye . 32 In this study , we fabricated PTX - loaded C - TAT - LP to further evaluate the application of the developed drug delivery system in antitumor therapy . The mechanism of internalization and antitumor effect of the developed drug de - livery system were evaluated in our work . Furthermore , we investigated the side effects of PTX - C - TAT - LP developed here regarding bone marrow suppression , immunotoxicity , and or - gan toxicity .

Synthesis of DSPE - PEG 2000 - TAT DSPE - PEG 2000 - TAT was prepared as previously described . 32 Brieﬂy , TAT peptide ( 1 . 5 equiv ) was reacted with DSPE - PEG 2000 - Mal ( 1 equiv ) in chloroform / methanol ( v / v = 2 : 1 ) con - taining triethylamine ( 2 equiv ) under N 2 atmosphere at room temperature for 24 h . After thin - layer chromatography ( TLC ) showed the disappearance of DSPE - PEG 2000 - Mal , the reaction mixture was evaporated in vacuo and the resulting dry thin ﬁlm was hydrated in 10 mM phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS , 3 mM KCl , 8 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1 mM KH 2 PO 4 and 137 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 4 ) for 20 min at 50 ◦ C , followed by soniﬁcation using a probe sonicator at 200 W for 75 s to form micelle . The obtained micelle solution was passed through a Sephadex - G50 column to remove the excess TAT . Finally , the collected solution was freeze - dried and then extracted by chloroform twice to remove the inorganic salts .

The number of moles of total lipids per liposomal formulation was 5 : mol . PBS at room temperature for 1 h ( 3 mM , ﬁnal concentration ) , followed by ultrasound to control the size . FITC - labeled and DiR - labeled liposomes were prepared as reference formulations except for containing FITC and DiR . Free PTX ( Taxol ) was prepared as follows : PTX was dissolved in the prepared sol - vent ( ethanol – cremophor ELP 35 mixture , v / v = 1 : 1 ) , and was diluted to required concentrations with PBS . The mean parti - cle sizes and zeta potentials of liposomes were measured us - ing Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS90 ( Malvern Instruments Ltd . , Malvern , Worcestershire , UK ) . The entrapment efﬁciency of PTX was determined by HPLC ( 426 HPLC Pump ; Alltech As - sociates Inc . , Deerﬁeld , Illinois , USA ) . The unentrapped PTX was removed by centrifugation at 9300 g for 10 min . The chro - matographically analysis was carried out by a Diamonsil C18 reversed - phase Inertsil column ( 200 × 4 . 6 mm 2 inner diam - eter , 5 - : m particle size ; Dikma , Beijing , China ) as described previously . 33 The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and water ( 60 : 40 , v / v ) . The PTX content in samples was quanti - ﬁed by a UV spectrophotometer ( SS420X Detector ; Multi - Link Inc . , USA ) at 227 nm with a ﬂow rate of 1 mL / min . The encap - sulation efﬁciency was calculated by the following formula : 34 EE ( % ) = Actual amount of drug loaded in liposomes Theory amount of drug loaded in liposomes × 100 % ( 1 ) Particle sizes were measured to evaluate the stability of li - posomes exposed to serum for up to 24 h . The PTX - loaded stealth liposomes ( PTX - SL ) , PTX - loaded TAT - modiﬁed lipo - somes without outer layer PEG ( PTX - TAT - LP ) , PTX - loaded cleavable PEG - modiﬁed TAT - LP ( PTX - C - TAT - LP ) , and PTX - loaded non - cleavable PEG - modiﬁed TAT - LP ( PTX - N - TAT - LP ) were prepared and incubated with equal volume of fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) at 37 ◦ C . Thereafter , aliquots of the mixture ( about 0 . 1 mL ) were collected and diluted to 1 mL at the discrete time points ( 0 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 10 , and 24 h ) , and the particle sizes were determined with Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS90 . The in vitro release behaviors of PTX from different lipo - some formulations were studied by dialysis method . 35 , 36 One milliliter aliquots of PTX - loaded liposomes or Taxol was sealed into dialysis tubes ( MW 8000 ) and incubated in 100 mL PBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) containing 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) Tween - 80 ◦ C for 48 h in an air bath shaker with a shaking rate of 50 rpm at temperature of 37 ◦ C . At the indicated time points , 0 . 1 mL aliquots of the release samples was withdrawn with the addition of the same volume of fresh medium . The concentration of PTX in the samples was determined by HPLC . Cell Line and Cell Culture Murine B16F1 melanoma tumor cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10 % FBS , 100 U / mL penicillin , and 100 U / mL strep - tomycin in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 at 37 ◦ C . Flow Cytometry Study Exponentially growing cells were seeded onto sterile cover glasses in a six - well plate at a density of 1 × 10 5 cells / well and incubated for 24 h . The culture medium was refreshed and the cells were exposed to different CFPE - labeled liposomes with or without GSH ( the ﬁnal concentration of GSH was 10 mM ) for 4 h at 37 ◦ C . The ﬁnal concentration of CFPE per well was 1 . 5 : g / mL . After incubation , the cells were washed with PBS for three times and ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 30 min . Then , the ﬁxed cells were washed again with PBS , followed by 1 : 2000 DAPI for 5 min . Fluorescence signals of cellular up - take were visualized with a confocal laser scanning microscope ( TCS SP5 AOBS confocal microscopy system ; Leica , Mannheim , Germany ) . For quantitative analysis , cells were detached with trypsin , centrifuged and re - suspended in PBS and analyzed by ﬂow cytometer ( Cytomics TM FC 500 ; Beckman Coulter , Miami , Florida , USA ) . Tumor Spheroid Uptake To form three - dimensional spheroids , B16F1 cells at a den - sity of 5 × 10 3 cells / well were seeded in 2 % low melting point agarose - coated 96 - well plates and allowed to grow to an average diameter of 400 – 500 : m . Afterwards , spheroids were subjected to CFPE - labeled liposomes ( the ﬁnal concentration of GSH was 10 mM , the ﬁnal concentration of CFPE was 15 : g / mL ) . Twelve hours later , 10 spheroids per group were collected , washed with cold PBS , enzymatically dissociated with 100 : L of Accumax at 37 ◦ C for 30 min and dispersed into single cells by gentle pipetting . All samples were measured using ﬂow cytometry . Identiﬁcation of Cellular Uptake Pathways To deﬁne the mechanisms involved in the cellular uptake of C - TAT - LP in the presence of GSH , B16F1 cells were pre - incubated with various inhibitors at 37 ◦ C for various times as follows : sodium azide ( 12 . 5 mM ) , Poly - lysine ( 4 : g / mL ) , colchicine ( 4 : g / mL ) , monensin ( 90 nM ) , Nocodazole ( 200 nM ) , cytochalasin D ( 60 ng / mL ) for 30 min and chlorpromazine ( 2 . 5 : g / mL ) , ﬁlipin ( 5 : g / mL ) for 1 h . 37 Then , cells were incubated with FITC - labeled liposomes ( the ﬁnal concentration of GSH was 10 mM , the ﬁnal concentration of CFPE was 1 . 5 : g / mL ) for additional 4 h at 37 ◦ C . The cellular uptake of C - TAT - LP at 4 ◦ C was also taken into consideration . Next , the cells were harvested and rapidly analyzed by ﬂow cytometer .

After washing , cells were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature , incubated with DAPI for 5 min , 38 and photographed using confocal laser scanning microscope . In Vitro Cytotoxicity Study Cell viability was measured by the MTT assay . The cells at a density of 5 × 10 3 cells per well were seeded into 96 - well plates , and incubated overnight . The cells were further treated with various formulations ( the ﬁnal concentration of GSH was 10 mM ) where the PTX dose ranged from 2 to 25 : M . Eighteen hours after incubation , 20 : L of MTT solution ( 5 mg / mL in PBS ) was added and incubation lasted another 4 h . Then , the supernatant was discarded and 150 : L of DMSO was added to dissolve the reduced MTT formazan . The UV absorbance of the resultant solutions was measured at 490 nm 39 by a mi - croplate reader ( Thermo Scientiﬁc Varioskan Flash , Waltham , MA , USA ) . The following equation was used to calculate cell viability ( % ) : Viability ( % ) = A test − A blank A control − A blank × 100 % ( 2 ) where A blank is the absorbance of the cultured well containing the medium only , A control is the absorbance of normally cultured cells , and A test is the absorbance of the cells cultured with the drug . 40 In Vitro Apoptosis Assay Apoptosis analysis was carried out by Annexin V - FITC / propidium iodide double staining according to instruc - tions of manufacturer . In brief , B16F1 cells ( 1 × 10 5 / well ) were seeded into six - well plates and allowed to adhere overnight . The medium in each well was then replaced with fresh medium con - taining various formulations ( the ﬁnal concentration of GSH was 10 mM ) . The ﬁnal concentration of PTX was 9 : M . Ten hours later , the cells were simultaneously trypsonized , washed with cold PBS , resuspended in 500 : L of binding buffer , fol - lowed by incubation with 5 : L Annexin V - FITC and 5 : L pro - pidium iodide for 15 min away from light . The stained cells were measured by ﬂow cytometry . Tumor Model Male , 5 – 6 weeks , 18 – 22 g C57 mice were used in this study . Murine melanoma tumor models were generated by inoculation of 1 × 10 6 B16F1 cells into the left ﬂanks of C57 mice and tumors were allowed to grow to a volume of 60 – 100 mm 3 . Biodistribution Study Biodistribution of liposomes developed here in tumor - bearing mice was performed using IVIS R (cid:2) Spectrum in vivo imaging sys - tem ( Caliper , Hopkington , Massachusetts , USA ) . Two weeks af - ter cell injection , mice were randomly divided into four groups ( 3 mice per group ) : SL ; TAT - LP ; N - TAT - LP ; C - TAT - LP . The mice were administered with DiR - labeled liposomes via tail vein at the dose of 200 : g DiR / kg and imaged by IVIS R (cid:2) Spectrum sys - tem at predetermined time intervals ( 6 , 24 , 48 , and 72 h ) after injection . In addition , mice were sacriﬁced at 24 h after injec - tion , and ex vivo images and measurements of ﬂuorescent sig - nals of the excised tumors / organs were obtained and analyzed with Living Image software version 4 . 3 . 1 . Evaluation of Delivery Efﬁciency In Vivo To investigate the delivery efﬁciency of liposomes in vivo , C57 mice bearing B16F1 tumors were randomly divided into six groups ( 3 mice per group ) : SL ; TAT - LP ; C - TAT - LP ( in the pres - ence of GSH ) ; C - TAT - LP ( in the absence of GSH ) ; N - TAT - LP ( in the presence of GSH ) ; N - TAT - LP ( in the absence of GSH ) . DiR - labeled liposomes were delivered to tumor - bearing mice i . v . through the tail vein at the dose of 200 : g DiR / kg , followed by administration of GSH ( 307 mg / kg ) or PBS after 24 h . Four hours later , after heart perfusion with Saline , tumors and liv - ers were excised and cryo - sectioned into 10 : m sections . Then , tissue sections were ﬁxed in 0 . 5 % Triton for 2 h , followed by DAPI staining to locate the nuclei . Fluorescence images of the sections were acquired by confocal laser scanning microscopy . Image analysis was performed with Image J software ( Windows version ) . Antitumor Efﬁcacy To evaluate antitumor efﬁcacy , mice were randomly divided into ﬁve groups ( 9 mice per group ) and were treated i . v . with Saline or a 10 mg / kg dose of PTX - SL , PTX - TAT - LP , PTX - N - TAT - LP , and PTX - C - TAT - LP , followed by administration of GSH ( 307 mg / kg ) or PBS after 24 h . The samples were injected into the mice through the lateral tail vein every 2 days for a total of six injections . The tumor volumes were calculated based on the equation lengths × widths 2 × 0 . 52 where lengths and widths were measured with an electronic digital caliper every 2 days . In addition , body weights were also recorded at 1 day interval for 14 days . Safety Evaluation The long - term toxicity of PTX formulations were assessed us - ing healthy mice . Male Kunming mice weighing 18 – 22 g ( 6 mice per group ) were i . v . injected with Saline , Taxol , C - TAT - LP , PTX - C - TAT - LP ( 10 mg / kg ) , and then treated with GSH ( 307 mg / kg ) or PBS at 24 h after injection . Injections were per - formed six times with an interval of 1 day . Forty - eight hours after the last injections , 0 . 3 mL of blood samples was withdrawn via cardiac puncture into heparinized tubes , and the following hematological parameters were analyzed by MEK - 6318K Au - tomated Hematology Analyzer ( Nihon - kohden , Shinjuku - ku , Tokyo , Japan ) : white blood cell ( WBC ) , red blood cell ( RBC ) , platelets ( PLT ) , and mean platelet volume ( MPV ) . Addition - ally , blood samples were subjected to centrifugation at 1500 g for 10 min to isolate serum . For serological evaluation , the ac - tivities of creatine kinase ( CK ) , serum aspartate transaminase ( AST ) , alanine transaminase ( ALT ) , urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , and creatinine ( CREA ) in serum were analyzed using Hitachi 7020 automatic biochemical analyzer ( Hitachi Ltd . , Tkyo , Japan ) . 41 Organs were harvested for HE analysis .

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Characterization of Liposomes All liposomes exhibited a mean particle size between 100 . 43 and 113 . 10 nm and an average polydispersity index between 0 . 215 and 0 . 270 ( Table 2 ) , being adequate for a passive target - ing based on EPR effect as the effective drug delivery using liposomes by EPR effect is highly dependent on size ranging from 100 to 200 nm in diameter . 42 Compared with the positive potential of PTX - TAT - LP , PTX - C - TAT - LP showed a negative zeta potential ( Table 2 ) because of the comodiﬁcation of cleav - able PEG on the liposomal surface , suggesting the enhanced stability and reduced non - speciﬁc distribution in vivo . 43 Be - cause PTX is water insoluble , after centrifugation at low speed , the nanosized liposomes were not precipitated but unencapsu - lated PTX was crystallized . 44 The encapsulation efﬁciencies of PTX - loaded liposomes were around 84 % ( Table 2 ) . In compari - son with PTX - SL , PTX - C - TAT - LP and PTX - N - TAT - LP showed a decrease in particle sizes , in accordance with the ﬁndings that the lamellarity of liposomes is reduced as PEG lipid concentra - tion is increased . 45 For PTX - SL , PTX - C - TAT - LP , and PTX - N - TAT - LP , the par - ticle sizes hardly changed for 24 h incubation with 50 % FBS , therefore , it could be speculated that PEGylation could avoid ( or at least reduce ) non - speciﬁc binding with the plasma mem - brane to stabilize the liposomes . 46 However , particle sizes of PTX - TAT - LP have increased to some extent , which may trig - ger the phagocytic identiﬁcation and uptake in vivo 47 ( Fig . 1a ) . The in vitro release proﬁles of PTX - loaded liposomes were shown in Figure 1b . Almost 80 % of PTX was released from Taxol after 6 h , whereas just about 30 % of PTX was released from li - posomes during the same time period , showing liposomes are a promising sustained drug delivery system . Additionally , PTX - SL group , PTX - C - TAT - LP group , and PTX - N - TAT - LP group showed similar release rate suggesting the introduction of high - density PEG with high molecular weight did not destabilize PTX - loaded liposomes developed here . In Vitro Cellular Uptake Study The cellular uptake study was performed on B16F1 cells to de - termine the drug delivery capacity of the liposomes into cells . Figure 2b showed TAT - LP unsurprisingly displayed higher up - take level than the rest of the other groups , whereas introduc - tion of long PEG chains to TAT - LP led to the decrease of cellular uptake as evidenced by the decreased ﬂuorescence intensity of cells treated with C - TAT - LP alone or N - TAT - LP alone , which Figure 1 .

( b ) Release proﬁles of PTX from various formulations over 48 h at 37 ◦ C . Data represent the mean ± SD ( n = 3 ) . was explained by steric hindrance . Notably , N - TAT - LP both with and without GSH exhibited a comparable level of cellu - lar uptake , while the cellular uptake of C - TAT - LP with GSH dramatically increased to 4 . 54 times higher than that of C - TAT - LP alone ( Fig . 2b ) . In addition , as shown in the confocal images ( Fig . 2a ) , in the presence of GSH , the ﬂuorescence intensity in cells exposed to N - TAT - LP was not enhanced , whereas the in - cremental ﬂuorescence intensity could be clearly visualized as an indication of a greater cellular uptake of C - TAT - LP . This re - vealed that the ﬁne - controlled detachment of redox - responsive PEG allowed the activation of TAT , leading to enhanced cell internalization . Moreover , C - TAT - LP without GSH was shown to have parallel cellular uptake level to SL ( Fig . 2b ) , suggesting TAT could be successfully shielded by cleavable PEG to avoid non - targeted association . Compared with conventional monolayer cultures , multicel - lular tumor spheroids are a more suitable approach to obtain and maintain the functional phenotype of human tumor cells 48 with regard to cellular heterogeneity , nutrient and oxygen gra - dients , cell – cell interactions , matrix deposition , and gene ex - pression proﬁles . 49 B16F1 tumor spheroids were prepared here to evaluate the cellular uptake efﬁciency and solid tumor pene - tration ability of liposomes .

Conversely , cellular uptake of C - TAT - LP with GSH showed to be 3 . 54 - fold higher than that of C - TAT - LP alone , which indicated steric hindrance conferred by PEGyla - tion was removed in the presence of GSH and the exposure of TAT encouraged liposomes’ penetration into spheroids . Cellular Uptake Mechanism and Intracellular Distribution Herein , we presented the systematic investigation of the cel - lular uptake mechanism and intracellular distribution for C - TAT - LP in the presence of GSH for understanding uptake characteristics of other structurally similar redox - responsive nanocarriers . As shown in Figure 4a , NaN 3 ( energy - depletion agent 50 ) and low temperature caused a marked reduction in C - TAT - LP ( in the presence of GSH ) uptake , indicating the redox - responsive liposomes mostly exploited an energy depen - dent internalization mechanism . 51 Preincubation of cells with Poly - lysine ( positive charge inhibitor 52 ) decreased C - TAT - LP ( in the presence of GSH ) uptake to 70 . 4 % of the control cell level , suggesting charge was a signiﬁcant factor to their cellu - lar uptake . Notably , the inhibition of C - TAT - LP ( in the presence of GSH ) uptake by monensin ( lysosome inhibitor 53 ) treatment revealed that the hydrogen ion concentration gradient played an important role in the cellular uptake of C - TAT - LP ( in the presence of GSH ) . Moreover , pre - treatment of the cells with cy - tochalasin D ( actin - disrupting agent 54 ) resulted in a 35 . 7 % re - duction in cellular uptake , indicating cytochalasin D - dependent delivery was also involved in the C - TAT - LP ( in the presence of GSH ) cellular entry process through the force generated by actin nucleation during membrane invagination . 55 Further - more , no signiﬁcant inhibition of cellular uptake was observed in presence of nocodazole ( microtubule - active agent 56 ) , which suggested that microtubule function was not necessary . Addi - tionally , the uptake of C - TAT - LP ( in the presence of GSH ) was strongly decreased by 39 . 5 % ( p < 0 . 01 ) and 28 . 8 % ( p < 0 . 05 ) , respectively , in the presence of colchicine ( macropinocytosis - mediated endocytosis pathway inhibitor 57 ) or Filipin ( caveolae - mediated endocytosis pathway inhibitor 58 ) , but chlorpromazine ( clathrin - mediated endocytosis pathway inhibitor 59 ) exerted lit - tle inhibition efﬁcacy on B16F1 cells . This illustrated the active endocytosis of C - TAT - LP ( in the presence of GSH ) was medi - ated by macropinocytosis with the involvement of cell skeleton and lysosome . Several groups have reported the drug delivery using stable shielded liposomes is often abrogated by an insufﬁcient endoso - mal escape and subsequent lysosomal degradation , 60 whereas we expected the corresponding cleavable PEG coated liposomes DOI 10 . 1002 / jps . 24291 Fu et al . , JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES 103 : 1160 – 1173 , 2015 1166 RESEARCH ARTICLE – Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology Figure 4 . Flow cytometry analysis of in vitro uptake of CFPE - labeled C - TAT - LP with GSH ( + ) in the presence of different inhibitors ( a ) and confocal microscopic images of the localization of CFPE - labeled liposomes and lysosomes in B16F1 cells ( b ) . B16F1 cells were treated with CFPE - labeled TAT - LP or C - TAT - LP in the presence of GSH ( + ) . The red ﬂuorescence responded to lysosomes stained with Lyso - tracker TM . The green ﬂuorescence responded to the CFPE - labeled liposomes . The yellow color was an indicator of colocalization of CFPE - labeled liposomes in lysosomes .

Scale bars represent 10 : m . * p < 0 . 05 , * * p < 0 . 01 , * * * p < 0 . 001 versus control . could escape from lysosomes owing to eliminated steric hin - drance and regained transmembrane ability . It was reported that cargos internalized by the clathrin - mediated pathway were targeted to the lysosomes , whereas cargos internalized via caveolae could escape lysosomal compartment . 61 , 62 The en - docytosis inhibition study implied ﬁlipin rather than chlorpro - mazine had a more important impact over cellular uptake of liposomes developed here . So the co - localization of liposomes with lysosomes may facilitate the understanding about their transport process . 63 As shown in Figure 4b , a fraction of green ﬂuorescence corresponding to TAT - LP was not co - localized with red ﬂuorescence , suggesting TAT - LP could escape from lyso - somes efﬁciently and release PTX into the cytoplasm . Simi - larly , in the presence of GSH , the lysosome escape of C - TAT - LP which resulted in the recovery of red color from yellow ( a compo - sition of red and green ﬂuorescence ) minimized the degradation of bioactive molecules and produced the higher cytotoxicity or transfection efﬁciencies . In Vitro Cytotoxicity Study MTT assay was conducted to evaluate in vitro cytotoxicity of various PTX formulations and the results were shown in Figure 5 . The cytotoxicity of PTX - loaded liposomes was dose dependent . PTX - TAT - LP showed higher cytotoxicity than all the other groups owing to higher cell uptake . The growth of B16F1 melanoma cells treated with PTX - C - TAT - LP in the pres - ence of GSH was signiﬁcantly suppressed . At simulated nor - mal physiologic condition , 84 . 7 % of B16F1 cells were viable at a PTX concentration of 16 : M , but viable cells were de - creased to 52 . 2 % in the presence of 10 mM GSH at an identical PTX concentration , which demonstrated that PTX - C - TAT - LP in the absence of GSH was nearly nontoxic to cells , causing decreased non - targeted cytotoxicity , while their cytotoxic activ - ity could be restored by GSH - triggered PEG deshielding . By contrast , changes in cytotoxicity were small without any no - ticeable difference between PTX - N - TAT - LP with and without GSH , revealing PEG deshielding was essential for high cytotox - icity . Meanwhile , Taxol exhibited strong cytotoxicity which was second only to PTX - TAT - LP , because free drugs could be trans - ported into the cells directly without a drug release process . 35 In addition , the cytotoxicity of solvent ( ethanol - cremophor ELP 35 mixture , v / v = 1 : 1 ) was quite notable . Only 55 . 2 % of B16F1 cancer cells treated with solvent were viable even at a con - centration as low as 4 : M . To achieve the cleavage of outer layer PEG , we tended to employ reductive agents at a rela - tively high concentration . As we all know , GSH , 64 cysteine , and 18 dithiothreitol 65 were commonly used as the reducing agents . MTT results showed the addition of 10 mM of cysteine or dithiothreitol resulted in strong toxicity on the B16F1 cells , whereas GSH was not cytotoxic at equivalent concentration . Thanks to the improved biocompatibility , C - TAT - LP drug de - livery system could be later applied to the in vivo application . Early apoptotic cells with the appearance of phosphatidylser - ine on the outer leaﬂet of cell membranes could be detected by Annexin V - FITC . On the other hand , late apoptotic or necrotic cells which have lost membrane integrity were stained by Fu et al . , JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES 103 : 1160 – 1173 , 2015 DOI 10 . 1002 / jps . 24291 RESEARCH ARTICLE – Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology 1167 Figure 5 .

PTX - C - TAT - LP ( in the absence of GSH ) and PTX - N - TAT - LP ( both in the presence of GSH and in the absence of GSH ) exhibited inferior cell apoptosis effect , which was compa - rable to PTX - SL without TAT modiﬁcation . Both the MTT and apoptosis assay showed that PTX - loaded TAT - decorated lipo - somes with GSH - triggered PEG deshielding capabilities exhib - ited advantages from the point of toxic activities against tumor cells . In Vivo Evaluation of Biodistribution and Delivery Efﬁciency Non - invasive intravital ﬂuorescence imaging technology was utilized to monitor the real - time distribution and tumor accu - mulation of DiR - labeled liposomes . The ﬂuorescence proﬁles in the tumors were comparable over time for both C - TAT - LP and N - TAT - LP , and the persistent and strong ﬂuorescence signals in tumor regions between 24 and 48 h after administration were detected for these two groups ( Fig . 7a ) . Therefore , we could in - fer C - TAT - LP remarkably accumulated at the tumor site by EPR effect between 24 and 48 h after injection and we chose 24 h post - liposome injection as the optimal timing for the ad - ministration of exogenous GSH . However , in the case of TAT - LP , the negligible ﬂuorescence signals occurred in tumor re - gions ( Figs . 7a and 7b ) , which corresponded to the acceler - ated blood clearance . 67 The ﬂuorescence signals from liver and spleen in mice treated with TAT - LP were stronger than C - TAT - LP and N - TAT - LP ( Figs . 7c and 7d ) , which clearly showed the non - speciﬁc delivery of TAT - LP . In comparison with SL containing DSPE - PEG 2000 ( the mole percentage was 5 % ) , higher ﬂuorescence signals could be ac - quired from the tumor site and sustained even up to 2 day when mice were treated with C - TAT - LP ( Figs . 7a and 7b ) , which fa - vored the antitumor efﬁcacy enhancement of C - TAT - LP owing to PEG with a ﬂexible form such as a brush structure . The brush structure is the ideal conﬁguration that ensures com - plete coverage of the surfaces of the liposomes and provides full protection . 68 , 69 Likewise , the increased half - life of C - TAT - LP in vivo was beneﬁted from the longer PEG chain lengths which was of positive relevance with the concentration of liposomes in plasma . 70 To investigate the delivery efﬁciency of liposomes in vivo , tumor - bearing mice were treated with PBS or GSH ( 307 mg / kg ) 24 h after injection with DiR - labeled liposomes . A larger and broader intra - tumoral distribution of DiR ﬂuorescence corre - sponding to C - TAT - LP ( in the presence of GSH ) was detected as compared with that of other groups ( Figs . 8b and 8c ) , which illustrated C - TAT - LP ( in the presence of GSH ) was able to pen - etrate deep into the tumor and be efﬁciently internalized into tumor cells . DiR ﬂuorescence signals of TAT - LP from tumor regions were very weak and scattered , while maximal ﬂuores - cence signals accumulated in the liver ( Figs . 8a and 8b ) , imply - ing TAT - LP suffered from a lack of tumor selectivity . Overall , these results showed the most important advantage of PTX - C - TAT - LP is that synergistic effect of EPR effect - driven accumu - lation in the tumor as well as tumor cell internalization induced by the restored TAT .

In vivo biodistribution of DiR - labeled liposomes in B16F1 tumor - bearing C57 mice at different time points ( a ) and ex vivo ﬂuorescence images of tumors ( b ) and organs ( c ) after 24 h injection . Fluorescence semiquantitative evaluation of the distribution of lipsomes in the excised tumors and organs was performed by living image software ( d ) . In our study , liposomes in tumor sites were activated by the exogenous GSH . Studies have showed the tumoral extracellular microenvironment is reductive , which is kept by three sources of reduction including : ( i ) the released of GSH owing to the death of tumor cells , ( ii ) thioredoxin reductase excretion in the tumoral microenvironment , and ( iii ) redox enzymes , glutare - doxin , thioredoxin and the corresponding reductases which are often overexpressed in many tumors . 71 However , no research showed the possibility to remove the PEG chains by the extra - cellular redox potential . Interestingly , based on the signiﬁcant difference in GSH level between the cytosol ( 2 – 20 : M ) and the extracellular ﬂuids ( 2 – 10 mM ) , 72 redox - responsive liposomes were designed and fabricated to boost the intracellular drug release by endogenous GSH . These redox - sensitive liposomes usually contain characteristic disulﬁde linkage ( s ) , which may be prone to rapid cleavage through thiol - disulde exchange re - actions with intracellular GSH . 73 However , the exact intracel - lular fate of redox - sensitive liposomes remains unclear . Some studies 74 have showed cell surface thiols may affect cell entry of disulﬁde - conjugated peptides . 75 Antitumor Efﬁcacy The antitumor efﬁcacy in vivo was evaluated in B16F1 tumor xenografts models . As shown in Figure 9a , PTX - loaded PEGy - lated liposomes exhibited higher antitumor activity as com - pared with PTX - TAT - LP group , which might be explained by the marked accumulation of liposomes at the tumor site via the EPR effect and further demonstrated the unselectivity and instability of TAT - cargo in vivo . Moreover , the tumor volumes in PTX - C - TAT - LP ( in the presence of GSH ) - treated mice were drastically reduced by 34 . 3 % compared with PTX - N - TAT - LP ( in the presence of GSH ) - treated mice ( Fig . 9a ) , indicating that the successful exposure of TAT was an essential prerequisite for the tumor activity . On the 14th day of treatment , the tumor inhibition ratio of PTX - C - TAT - LP with GSH treated group was 69 . 4 % , higher than that of PTX - N - TAT - LP with GSH ( 53 . 4 % ) , PTX - TAT - LP ( 6 . 5 % ) , and PTX - SL ( 14 . 7 % ) , implying the highest anti - tumor efﬁcacy of redox - responsive liposomes . Correspond - ingly , PTX - C - TAT - LP ( in the presence of GSH ) signiﬁcantly prolonged animal survival time ( Fig . 9c ) . In addition , the body weights of mice were not inﬂuenced over 14 days of treatment ( Fig . 9b ) , which indicated the treatments with PTX - loaded lipo - somes at a PTX dose of 10 mg / kg did not cause severe toxicity in mice . Taken together , the improved tumor speciﬁcity due to the enhanced EPR effect conferred by PEGylation and the ef - ﬁcient tumor cell internalization by the exposed TAT following the cleavage of PEG together contributed to high anticancer activities . Safety Evaluation Finding safe and biocompatible redox - sensitive materials is a critical part in the potential clinical translation of liposomes . Some efforts have been made to explore the toxicity of liposomes developed here in vivo . Hematological tests were performed to evaluate the bone marrow suppression and adverse immune effects ( the results were shown in Table 3 ) . Taxol - treated group showed a reduction of 29 . 0 % in WBC count compared with Saline group , which was Fu et al . , JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES 103 : 1160 – 1173 , 2015 DOI 10 . 1002 / jps . 24291 RESEARCH ARTICLE – Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology 1169 Figure 8 .

Immunosuppres - sion evidenced by the dramatic depletion of WBC count induced by PTX - C - TAT - LP ( in the presence of GSH ) appeared to be a consequence of the inadvertent recognition of liposomes as for - eign entities by leukocytes and may lead to toxicity in the host and / or lack of therapeutic beneﬁt . 77 We need more information to explore how immunosuppression affected the antitumor ac - tivity of PTX - C - TAT - LP ( in the presence of GSH ) . It was found that the RBC count in Saline group was 8 . 52 ± 0 . 50 , which was signiﬁcantly decreased to 7 . 72 ± 0 . 64 after treatment with PTX - C - TAT - LP ( in the presence of GSH ) . The decrease of RBC count may be as relevant for the organ damage . Moreover , it is noteworthy that mice which received the liposomal vesicles C - TAT - LP ( in the presence of GSH ) had no signiﬁcant decreases in RBC count , in comparison with control group . Additionally , the treatment of Taxol , C - TAT - LP ( in the presence of GSH ) and PTX - C - TAT - LP ( in the presence of GSH ) elicited no signiﬁcant variation of PLT and mean MPV compared with control group . The serological evaluation was performed to determine the organ toxicity induced by different formulations ( the results are shown in Table 4 ) . ALT is the clinical chemistry gold standard of hepatotoxicity . Additional markers such as AST are sought to add information to serum ALT enzymatic signals for the safety evaluation . 78 Treatment with Taxol resulted in a signiﬁcant in - crease in AST and ALT levels compared with saline group ( p < 0 . 05 ) , whereas there was no obvious difference after treatment with C - TAT - LP ( in the presence of GSH ) and PTX - C - TAT - LP ( in the presence of GSH ) , which indicated the C - TAT - LP ( in the presence of GSH ) system could remarkably suppress hepato - toxicity induced by PTX . Cardiovascular toxicity is a potential short - or long - term complication of anticancer therapy . AST , CK can be employed for diagnosis of myocardial damage . 79 The CK value were 660 . 6 ± 391 . 8 and 492 . 4 ± 481 . 2 UL for Taxol , PTX - C - TAT - LP ( in the presence of GSH ) , respectively . The administration of PTX - C - TAT - LP ( in the presence of GSH ) remarkably suppressed cardiotoxicity in Taxol - treated mice , as determined by the signiﬁcant reduction in CK . CREA and BUN are the primary options for monitoring kidney dysfunction in humans . 80 CREA is subject to alteration by fewer nonrenal fac - tors than is BUN . 81 The treatment with PTX - C - TAT - LP ( in the presence of GSH ) resulted in 28 . 3 % , 21 . 6 % increase of the BUN level compared with control ( p < 0 . 01 ) and Taxol ( p < 0 . 01 ) , respectively , whereas no signiﬁcant differences were shown on DOI 10 . 1002 / jps . 24291 Fu et al . , JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES 103 : 1160 – 1173 , 2015 1170 RESEARCH ARTICLE – Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology Table 3 .

This was in consistent with the results of histopathological examination ( Fig . 10 ) , which clearly showed normal morphology of organs without necrosis , hyperemia , or inﬂammation . The possible re - nal toxicity may be a consequence of unique pharmacokinetics of long - circulating liposomes unlike anticancer drugs . Once in the bloodstream , surface non - modiﬁed liposomes ( conventional liposomes ) and chemotherapy are quickly opsonized and sent to the mononuclear phagocytes system ( MPS ) ( liver , spleen , lungs , and bone marrow ) which thus bring about target toxicity by high organ concentrations . 82 In general , surface modiﬁcation of liposomes via the introduction of hydrophilic components al - ters and restricts drug biodistribution , decreases the volume of distribution , retards drug metabolism . 83 The incremental nephritic distribution of C - TAT - LP ( in the presence of GSH ) may be responsible for renal toxicity . Renal damage leads to a reduced erythropoietin count , which result in a reduction of red blood cell count . It was notable that renal toxicity induced by the administration of PTX - C - TAT - LP ( in the presence of GSH ) was not serious and the liposomal vesicles C - TAT - LP ( in the presence of GSH ) was nontoxic . As a result , C - TAT - LP is a promising carrier for tumor target therapy with high antitumor efﬁcacy . CONCLUSIONS In our study , the PTX - loaded exogenous - GSH triggered TAT - presenting liposomes ( PTX - C - TAT - LP ) were constructed . Ow - ing to the cleavable PEG which masks the TAT moieties , PTX - loaded liposomes have a long circulation time for enhanced tumor accumulation under normal physiologic condition . In the presence of GSH , however , PEG was removed and TAT was exposed , triggering a fast cellular uptake . The endocytosis in - hibition study revealed that the active endocytosis of C - TAT - LP was mediated by macropinocytosis and caveolae with the involvement of cell skeleton and lysosome , enabling the lipo - somes an effective lysosomal escape . PTX - loaded C - TAT - LP in the presence of GSH exhibited much superiority in anti - tumor effect both in vitro and in vivo . Moreover , histopatho - logical evaluation and hematology assay showed C - TAT - LP could reduce the hepatotoxicity and cardiotoxicity of PTX . In summary , C - TAT - LP represents an attractive design for cancer treatment .
