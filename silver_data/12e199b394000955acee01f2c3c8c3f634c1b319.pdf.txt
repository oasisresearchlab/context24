However , visualizing speciﬁc , endogenous genomic loci remains challenging in living cells . Here , we demonstrate such an imaging technique by repurposing the bacterial CRISPR / Cas sys - tem . Using an EGFP - tagged endonuclease - deﬁcient Cas9 protein and a structurally optimized small guide ( sg ) RNA , we show robust imaging of repetitive elements in telomeres and coding genes in living cells . Furthermore , an array of sgRNAs tiling along the target locus enables the visualization of nonrep - etitive genomic sequences . Using this method , we have studied telomere dynamics during elongation or disruption , the subnuclear localization of the MUC4 loci , the cohesion of replicated MUC4 loci on sister chromatids , and their dynamic behaviors dur - ing mitosis . This CRISPR imaging tool has potential to signiﬁcantly improve the capacity to study the conformation and dynamics of native chromosomes in living human cells . INTRODUCTION The functional output of the human genome is determined by its spatial organization and dynamic interactions with protein and RNA regulators . For example , the subnuclear positioning of genomic elements can modulate gene expression , heterochro - matin formation , and DNA replication ( Misteli , 2007 ; Misteli , 2013 ) . To elucidate the mechanisms that relate genome function to its spatiotemporal organization , a method to image speciﬁc DNA sequences in living cells would be indispensable . So far , such studies have mostly relied on ﬂuorescently tagged DNA - binding proteins . However , because of their ﬁxed target sequence and limited choices of native DNA - binding proteins , this approach has been restricted to imaging artiﬁcial repetitive sequences inserted into the genome ( Robinett et al . , 1996 ) or specialized genomic elements such as the telomeres ( Wang et al . , 2008 ) , centromeres ( Hellwig et al . , 2008 ) , and , in bacteria , H - NS - binding loci ( Wang et al . , 2011 ) . Imaging arbitrary , endog - enous genes and genomic loci remains challenging . Although ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) ( Langer - Safer et al . , 1982 ; Lichter et al . , 1990 ) brings in target sequence ﬂexibility through base paring of the nucleic acid probes , it is incompatible with live imaging due to sample ﬁxation and DNA denaturation . Thus , we sought to develop a genome - imaging technique that combines the ﬂexibility of nucleic acid probes and the live imag - ing capability of DNA - binding proteins . The type II CRISPR ( c lustered r egularly i nterspaced s hort p alindromic r epeats ) system derived from Streptococcus pyogenes ( Barrangou et al . , 2007 ; Deltcheva et al . , 2011 ; Wie - denheft et al . , 2012 ) provides a promising platform to accom - plish this goal . CRISPR uses a Cas9 protein to recognize DNA sequences , with target speciﬁcity solely determined by a small guide ( sg ) RNA and a protospacer adjacent motif ( PAM ) ( Jinek et al . , 2012 ) . Upon binding to target DNA , the Cas9 - sgRNA complex generates a DNA double - stranded break . Recent work has demonstrated that by harnessing this RNA - guided nuclease activity CRISPR can be repurposed to edit the genomes of a broad range of organisms ( Cong et al . , 2013 ; Mali et al . , 2013 ; Wang et al . , 2013 ) . Furthermore , a repurposed , nuclease - deactivated Cas9 ( dCas9 ) protein has been used to regulate endogenous gene expression by controlling the RNA polymerase activity or by modulating promoter accessibility when fused with transcription factors ( Gilbert et al . , 2013 ; Qi et al . , 2013 ) . Going beyond gene editing and regulation , we Cell 155 , 1479 – 1491 , December 19 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . 1479 A B Homo sapiens telomere TTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGG . . . sgTelomere PAM Protospacer repeat C dCas9 - EGFP sgRNA Imaging Sequence - specifically enriched EGFP signals Delivery + sgTelomere ( F + E ) + sgTelomere + sgGAL4 D 8 10 12 2 4 6 0 + sgGAL4 + sgTelomere + sgTelomere ( F + E ) Telomere intensity % o f w ho l e - nu c l eu s G F P pU6 pSFFV sgRNA NLS pTRE3G EGFP Inducible dCas9 - EGFP Transactivator sgRNA dcas9 Tet - On 3G NLS pCMV puro R mCherry t2A CRISPR imaging system BFP NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGUUUAAG A GCUAUGCUG 5’ 3’ GCCACGGUGAAAAAGUUCAACUAUUGCCUGAUCGGAAUAAAUUUGAACGAUACGAC G AAA CGGUGCUUUUUUU GAU Modified nucleotides NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGUUUUAG A GCUA 5’ 3’ GCCACGGUGAAAAAGUUCAACUAUUGCCUGAUCGGAAUAAAAUUGAACGAU G AAA CGGUGCUUUUUUU GAU sgRNA ( F + E ) combined S . pyogenes terminator DNA matching region dCas9 binding hairpin sgRNA 14 NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGUUUAAG A GCUA 5’ 3’ GCCACGGUGAAAAAGUUCAACUAUUGCCUGAUCGGAAUAAAUUUGAACGAU G AAA CGGUGCUUUUUUU GAU sgRNA ( F ) A - U flip NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNGUUUUAG A GCUAUGCUG 5’ 3’ GCCACGGUGAAAAAGUUCAACUAUUGCCUGAUCGGAAUAAAAUUGAACGAUACGAC G AAA CGGUGCUUUUUUU GAU sgRNA ( E ) stem extension + sgTelomere ( E ) + sgTelomere ( F ) d C as9 - E G F P F . . .

Here , we report a CRISPR - based technique for sequence - speciﬁc visualization of genomic elements in living human cells . Our imaging system consists of an EGFP - tagged , endonu - clease - deactivated dCas9 protein and a structurally optimized sgRNA that improves its interaction with the dCas9 protein . We show that this optimized CRISPR system enables robust imaging of repetitive elements in both telomeres and protein - coding genes such as the Mucin genes in human cells . Further - more , we use multiple sgRNAs to tile along the target locus to visualize nonrepetitive genomic sequences in the human genome . This CRISPR imaging method allows easy and reliable tracking of the telomere dynamics during telomere elongation or disruption , and enables us to observe chromatin organization and dynamics throughout the cell cycle . The CRISPR technol - ogy offers a complementary approach to FISH or the use of DNA - binding proteins for imaging , providing a general platform for the study of native chromatin organization and dynamics in living human cells . RESULTS An Optimized CRISPR System Enables Visualization of Telomeres and Enhances Gene Regulation To engineer the CRISPR system for imaging endogenous genomic sequences , we fused a dCas9 protein lacking the endonucleolytic activity to an enhanced green ﬂuorescent pro - tein ( EGFP ) . Coexpression of dCas9 - EGFP and sequence - spe - ciﬁc sgRNAs should allow the enrichment of ﬂuorescent signal at the targeted genomic loci for imaging ( Figure 1A ) . To better target the dCas9 - EGFP protein into the nucleus , we tested different dCas9 and EGFP fusions carrying two copies of nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) sequences ( Figure S1A available online ) . A fully nuclear - localized version ( # 4 ) was selected ( see Extended Experimental Procedures for the dCas9 - EGFP sequence ) . We then created clonal RPE , HeLa , and UMUC3 cell lines that stably expressed dCas9 - EGFP from an inducible Tet - On 3G system using lentiviral vectors ( Figure 1B ) . To reduce the back - ground ﬂuorescence that arises from unbound dCas9 - EGFP , we performed subsequent imaging experiments at the basal level of dCas9 - EGFP expression without doxycycline induction ( Figure S1B ) . We started by imaging human telomeres , specialized chro - matin structures composed of 5 to 15 kb tracts of TTAGGG repeats and associated proteins ( Moyzis et al . , 1988 ) . Such re - peats allow the recruitment of multiple dCas9 - EGFP proteins to the same locus using a single sgRNA sequence . Following a previously reported sgRNA design ( Jinek et al . , 2012 ; Qi et al . , 2013 ) , we created an sgRNA ( sgTelomere ) containing a 22 nt telomere targeting sequence ( Figures 1C and 1D ; see Extended Experimental Procedures for sgRNA sequences ) . We infected stable dCas9 - EGFP RPE cells with a lentivirus that expressed sgTelomere from a murine polymerase III U6 promoter ( Fig - ure 1B ) . An sgRNA that had no cognate target in the human genome ( sgGAL4 ) was used as the negative control . At 48 hr postinfection , about 80 % sgTelomere - expressing cells showed ﬂuorescent puncta resembling telomeres in addition to bright regions resembling nucleoli . In contrast , sgGAL4 - expressing cells only contained nucleolar signal ( Figure 1D ) . Nevertheless , the observed number of telomere puncta , typically 10 to 40 per cell , was substantially lower than the expected telomere number in human cells ( 146 for our RPE cells , see later karyotyping results ) , indicating that the system was suboptimal . Previous work has indicated that the sgRNA expression level limits CRISPR / Cas9 function in human cells ( Jinek et al . , 2013 ) . Indeed , the observed nucleolus - like signal possibly came from dCas9 proteins that were not bound to sgRNA . Therefore , we modiﬁed the sgRNA design to increase its stability and to enhance its assembly with the dCas9 protein ( Figures 1C and S1C ) . To avoid premature termination of U6 Pol - III transcription , we removed a putative Pol - III terminator ( 4 consecutive U’s ) in the sgRNA stem - loop by an A - U base pair ﬂip ( Figures 1C , sgRNA ( F ) ) ( Nielsen et al . , 2013 ) . To improve sgRNA - dCas9 as - sembly , we extended the dCas9 - binding hairpin structure ( Fig - ures 1C , sgRNA ( E ) ) . Both sgRNA designs produced increased puncta numbers as well as decreased background and nucleolar signals . Further enhanced imaging efﬁciency was achieved by combining the A - U ﬂip and hairpin extension ( Figures 1C and 1D , sgRNA ( F + E ) ) , which increased the observable puncta number by 2 - fold and the signal - to - background intensity ratio by 5 - fold ( Figure 1E ) . To verify the speciﬁcity and efﬁciency of telomere imaging by CRISPR , we performed two - color imaging with telomere - spe - ciﬁc FISH using Cy5 - tagged peptide nucleic acid ( PNA ) probes , or with immunoﬂuorescence for endogenous TRF2 , a protein in the shelterin complex that binds to the telomeric DNA repeats ( Grifﬁth et al . , 1999 ) ( Figure 1F ) . For brighter CRISPR puncta ( top 1 / 3 ) we observed nearly perfect ( 95 % ) colocalization with either PNA or TRF2 puncta . However , we had to use a modiﬁed PNA FISH protocol to preserve dCas9 - EGFP signal ( see Extended Experimental Procedures ) , which resulted in reduced efﬁ - ciency for PNA to detect shorter telomeres . The relatively high background of TRF2 immunoﬂuorescence also hindered short telomere detection . Therefore , we measured the total telomere number identiﬁed by CRISPR or standard PNA FISH to compare the labeling efﬁciencies . The two numbers perfectly matched ( Figure 1E ) , indicating a similar efﬁciency for CRISPR and PNA FISH . In addition , the ﬁnding that no puncta were detected in the negative sgGAL4 control suggests a minimal off - target effect for CRISPR imaging .

Cell 155 , 1479 – 1491 , December 19 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . 1481 Interestingly , this optimized sgRNA design also greatly enhanced gene regulation by CRISPR interference ( CRISPRi ) ( Qi et al . , 2013 ) . We observed that the new sgRNA ( F + E ) design signiﬁcantly improved transcriptional repression of a genomic EGFP reporter in HEK293 cells that stably expressed dCas9 or dCas9 - KRAB ( Figure 1G ) . We also tested additional sgRNA de - signs that consisted of a polymerase - III SINE poly - adenylation signal sequence at the 3 0 end , alternative A - U ﬂips , or alternative ways of hairpin extension ( Figure S1C ) . No further improvement of transcriptional repression was observed compared to that in the three designs described above ( Figure S1D ) . Thus , the opti - mized sgRNA ( F + E ) design improves efﬁciencies for both imaging and gene regulation . CRISPR Imaging Allows Visualization of Repetitive Sequences in Endogenous Protein - Coding Genes To expand the applications of CRISPR imaging , we tested whether we could use CRISPR to image protein - coding genes . Speciﬁcally , we chose the MUC4 gene on chromosome 3 that encodes a glycoprotein important for protecting mucus in diverse epithelial tissues and during tumor formation ( Hollings - worth and Swanson , 2004 ) . The MUC4 gene contains a region with variable number tandem repeats ( 100 to 400 repeats of a 48 bp sequence ) in the second exon ( Figure 2A ) ( Nollet et al . , 1998 ) . To image the MUC4 exon , we designed three sgRNAs ( see Extended Experimental Procedures for sgRNA sequences ) targeting this repetitive region ( sgMUC4 - E1 , E2 , and E3 ) .

The best one , sgMUC4 - E3 , showed two or more puncta in all cells even when the original sgRNA design was used ( Figures 2B and 2C ) . We conﬁrmed the speciﬁcity of the CRISPR signal by colabeling with oligo - DNA FISH of the same repetitive region in ﬁxed cells ( Figure 2D , see Extended Experimental Procedures for DNA - FISH probe sequence ) . The MUC4 gene also contains (cid:2) 90 repeats of a 15 bp sequence in the third intron . For this tract , we designed two sgRNAs with different lengths of complementarity ( 23 bp and 13 bp ) . In this case , the sgRNA ( F + E ) design was critical for visual - izing the MUC4 intron ( Figures 2B and 2C ) . Surprisingly , the 13 nt sgMUC4 - I2 ( F + E ) showed higher labeling efﬁciency , suggesting that its DNA - binding afﬁnity might not be lower than that of the longer sgMUC4 - I1 ( F + E ) , as both sgRNAs have a footprint of two 15 bp repeats with the 3 nt PAM included . This result possibly suggests a shorter sgRNA base pairing length requirement for imaging compared to that for efﬁcient gene editing or gene regu - lation ( Jinek et al . , 2012 ; Qi et al . , 2013 ) . We noticed that increasing the dosage of sgRNA lentivirus could reduce the nucleolar signal from dCas9 - EGFP . For example , for both MUC4 and telomere labeling , infecting cells with 1 : 3 - diluted lentivirus effectively reduced the nucleolar signal ( Figure S2A ) . Furthermore , the optimized sgRNA ( F + E ) design not only allowed efﬁcient labeling of target sites using a lower viral dosage ( Figure S2B ) , but also decreased the nucleolar signal ( Figure S2C ) . These observations further conﬁrmed that sgRNA is a limiting factor for CRISPR imaging : low expression or sub - optimal design potentially contributes to off - target clustering of dCas9 - EGFP in nucleoli . We saw three labeled MUC4 loci in the majority of cells by both exon and intron labeling . Indeed , whole - cell karyotyping re - vealed aneuploidy of our RPE cell line ( Figure S3A ) , and chromo - some 3 trisomy was further conﬁrmed by FISH staining of two different regions on chromosome 3 ( Figure S3B ) . Concomitantly , in (cid:2) 15 % of cells , we also observed six CRISPR puncta with either MUC4 exon or intron labeling , suggesting that these cells had replicated these genomic loci ( Figures 2B and 2C ) . These re - sults demonstrated that CRISPR imaging is capable of detecting gene copy numbers in living cells . To demonstrate the generality of CRISPR imaging in different cell types , we imaged telomeres and MUC4 in HeLa cells using sgTelomere ( F + E ) and sgMUC4 - E3 . In both cases , we observed effective labeling of the target genomic loci ( Figure 2E ) . We simi - larly observed three copies of MUC4 loci in our HeLa cell line . FISH experiments conﬁrmed that these cells were also trisomic for chromosome 3 ( Figure S3B ) . To test the ability to image repetitive elements in other genes , we designed sgRNAs to visu - alize the MUC1 gene on chromosome 1 ( Figure 2F ) ( Gendler et al . , 1990 ) . The MUC1 gene contains a polymorphic region with a variable number of 60 - bp repeats in the third exon and intron , and the sgRNAs were designed to target within each repeat ( sgMUC1 - E1 , E2 , E3 ) . We similarly observed multiple distinct MUC1 loci in RPE cells , and again observed that the labeling efﬁciency varied by target sequences . To test whether CRISPR imaging affects gene expression , we performed qPCR to quantify MUC4 transcription in RPE cells labeled with sgMUC4 - E1 , sgMUC4 - E3 ( F + E ) , sgMUC4 - I2 ( F + E ) , or both sgMUC4 - E3 ( F + E ) and sgMUC4 - I2 ( F + E ) ( Figure S3C ) . Only in the presence of both sgMUC4 - E3 ( F + E ) and sgMUC4 - I2 ( F + E ) , a weak ( (cid:2) 45 % ) repression was observed . This phenomenon is consistent with previous observations that targeting down - stream sequences of the transcription start site is less effective for CRISPRi gene silencing ( Qi et al . , 2013 ) . In contrast , labeling MUC1 using sgMUC1 - E1 ( F + E ) or sgMUC1 - E3 ( F + E ) both repressed MUC1 transcription by (cid:2) 80 % ( Figure S3D ) , likely due to the fact that the target sites were close ( (cid:2) 1 kb ) to the transcription start site . Thus , although CRISPR imaging may perturb gene expres - sion , this perturbation could be minimized by targeting the far downstream region or upstream region of the promoter ( but not the enhancers ) . CRISPR Allows Imaging of Arbitrary Nonrepetitive Genomic Sequences Most sequences in the human genome are nonrepetitive . Unlike other DNA - binding proteins , the target speciﬁcity of dCas9 is determined by sgRNA , which allows easy labeling of nonrepeti - tive sequences by targeting multiple adjacent sites with a single dCas9 protein . To demonstrate this capability of CRISPR to im - age nonrepetitive genomic loci , we designed 73 sgRNAs target - ing both DNA strands spanning a 5 kb nonrepetitive region in the ﬁrst intron of MUC4 gene ( Figure 3A , see Extended Experimental Procedures for target sequences ) . We produced lentiviral cock - tails , each containing 5 to 6 sgRNAs , and infected different numbers of sgRNAs ( 16 , 26 , 36 , or 73 ) into RPE cells . The total virus dosage was twice as much as used for repetitive sequence imaging . We observed effective labeling of the MUC4 loci using 36 sgRNAs . Increasing the number of sgRNAs to 73 did not improve the labeling efﬁciency , but reducing the sgRNA number to 16 resulted in no detectable puncta ( Figures 3A and 3B ) . Our results suggest that 26 to 36 sgRNAs are sufﬁcient to detect a nonrepetitive genomic locus using CRISPR . Further reduction of the required number of sgRNAs could be implemented by decreasing the background level of dCas9 - EGFP or improving the imaging sensitivity ( Gaj et al . , 2013 ) . We also used multiple sgRNAs to colabel either the same MUC4 gene or both MUC1 and MUC4 genes . Labeling the MUC4 gene using two sgRNAs , sgMUC4 - E3 and sgMUC4 - I2 ( F + E ) , did not result in more puncta compared to using sgMUC4 - E3 alone ( Figure 3C ) , which can be explained by the close proximity ( (cid:2) 1 kb ) of these two loci . In contrast , using both sgMUC4 - E3 and sgMUC1 - E1 led to 6 to 9 puncta observed in 45 % of cells ( Figure 3D ) . Unlike the MUC4 - only images where the six puncta formed pairs , the MUC1 + MUC4 images showed mostly unpaired spots . These results demonstrate the potential of using CRISPR for the simultaneous and multiplexing labeling of many genomic elements . CRISPR Imaging Monitors Telomere Length The ability of using CRISPR to label telomeres prompted us to test whether it allowed direct detection of the telomere length in living cells . Indeed , in two - color images of telomeres in RPE cells ( Figure 1F ) , the intensity of individual telomere puncta detected using CRISPR and PNA FISH showed good linear correlation ( Figure S4A ) . Linear correlation was also found between CRISPR labeling and TRF2 immunolabeling of the telomeres ( Figure S4B ) . Cell 155 , 1479 – 1491 , December 19 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . 1483 Although two - color imaging directly assesses whether CRISPR intensity accurately measures the length of individual telomeres , these experiments had the caveats of low efﬁciency in detecting short telomeres by TRF2 immunoﬂuorescence and our modiﬁed PNA FISH protocol . Therefore , we also analyzed the median telomere puncta intensity labeled by CRISPR imaging or by PNA FISH , a common method for quantifying telomere length ( Figure 4A ) ( Hultdin et al . , 1998 ) . We compared telomere images of RPE cells and those of the UMUC3 human bladder cancer cell line . The median CRISPR puncta intensity in RPE cells was 3 . 1 times as high as that in UMUC3 cells , which exactly matched the intensity ratio measured by PNA FISH ( Figure 4A ) . In both RPE and UMUC3 cells , we detected similar numbers of telomeres using CRISPR imaging or PNA FISH ( Figures S4C ) . Moreover , the telomere length in UMUC3 cells can be conditionally elongated by trans - fection with a human telomerase RNA ( hTR ) gene ( 1 . 6 to 5 kb without hTR ; 3 to 10 kb with hTR ) ( Xu and Blackburn , 2007 ) . In this study , 6 days after hTR lentiviral infection , we detected a 63 % increase of median PNA FISH intensity , while the median CRISPR intensity also increased by 28 % ( Figure 4B ) . The corre - lation of both measured intensity and telomere counts suggests that CRISPR imaging is a method comparable to PNA FISH for detecting telomere length , with the added feature of labeling in living cells . CRISPR Imaging Monitors Telomere Dynamics CRISPR imaging offers a unique platform to track native genetic elements in living cells without introducing artiﬁcially inserted sequences . We performed high - frequency ( 0 . 2 s per frame ) time - lapse microscopy to track the movement of telomeres in living RPE cells . Single - particle tracking revealed the conﬁned diffusion of telomeres , which is occasionally overlaid with a slow directed motion ( Figure 5A and Movie S1 ) . To test whether CRISPR labeling could affect telomere dynamics , we compared telomere movement labeled by CRISPR or TRF1 , one of the major telomeric - binding proteins ( Wang et al . , 2008 ) .

As telomere damage has previously been shown to enhance telomere movement , likely to facilitate DNA repair ( Dimitrova et al . , 2008 ; Wang et al . , 2008 ) , we examined the movement of telomeres after shRNA knockdown of TIN2 , which disrupts the telomere shelterin complex ( Kim et al . , 1999 ) . We conﬁrmed the resulting DNA damage localized to telomeres by immuno - staining of 53BP1 , a protein recruited to sites of DNA damage ( d’Adda di Fagagna et al . , 2003 ) ( Figure S5A ) . We note that dCas9 binding did not apparently affect telomere integrity because we observed an almost negligible increase in telomeri - cally localized 53BP1 compared to TIN2 knockdown ( Figures S5A and S5B ) . As shown by the MSD curves detected by CRISPR ( Figure 5E ) , we saw an expected increase in micro - scopic diffusion speed after TIN2 knockdown but not with a scrambled shRNA as the negative control .

These results demonstrate the power of CRISPR to directly visualize the movement of endogenous genomic elements . CRISPR Imaging Reveals the Organization and Dynamics of MUC4 Loci In addition to special genetic elements such as the telomere , CRISPR imaging also allows us to examine the spatiotem - poral dynamics of protein - encoding DNA sequences in live cells . By tagging MUC4 exon 2 and intron 3 simultaneously using two sgRNAs , we measured the position of MUC4 loci by approximating the shape of the nucleus as an oval ( Figure 6A ) . The distribution of normalized MUC4 radial position peaked near the nuclear enve - lope ( Figure 6B ) , indicating that MUC4 loci preferentially locate at the nuclear periphery . Furthermore , by calculating the angle between any two MUC4 loci ( Figure 6C ) , we found that MUC4 loci exhibited polarized spatial organi - zation , with the three allelic loci clustering in the same half of the nucleus . These live - cell observations support the notion of nonrandom spatial organization of genes and chromosomes ( Cremer and Cremer , 2010 ) . Next , we monitored the movement of MUC4 loci ( Figure 6D and Movie S2 ) . Similar to telomeres , trajectories of these loci dis - played conﬁned movement at short ( < 5 s ) time scales , with addi - tional macroscopic diffusion or directional transport observed over longer time scales ( Figure S6A ) . The short - time - scale conﬁnement sizes and the microscopic diffusion coefﬁcients were highly heterogeneous ( Figures 6E , S6B , and S6C ) . The median values of both parameters were comparable to those measured using LacO arrays on bacterial artiﬁcial chromosomes in CHO cells ( Levi et al . , 2005 ) . Using 36 sgRNAs simultaneously , we also performed live imaging of nonrepetitive sequences of the MUC4 gene . Despite slightly lower signal , we observed similar movement behaviors , comparable to the movement of repetitive sequences of MUC4 ( Movie S3 ) . Cell 155 , 1479 – 1491 , December 19 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . 1485 Finally , we characterized replicated MUC4 loci during late S phase and G2 phase , which appeared as closely located pairs of dCas9 - GFP puncta ( Figure 6F and Movie S3 ) . The distance between such paired MUC4 loci on sister chromatids often reached over 1 m m ( Figure 6G ) and was similar for all three pairs within the same cell ( Figure 6F ) . Although each individual MUC4 punctum in the pair underwent fast diffusive movement ( Movie S4 ) , the pair distance remained relatively constant over several hours ( Figure 6H ) . These results suggest a stable but dispersed distribution along the genomic DNA of factors such as cohesin , which physically holds the two sister chromatids together ( Nasmyth and Haering , 2009 ) . CRISPR Imaging Reports Chromosome Dynamics during Mitosis By labeling speciﬁc genomic loci with dCas9 - EGFP , we could also investigate chromosome reorganization during cell division . For this purpose , we tagged MUC4 exon 2 and intron 3 simulta - neously in HeLa cells . Using time - lapse imaging , we recorded cell division from G2 through cytokinesis ( Figure 7A and Movie S5 ) . To examine the detailed relationship between the MUC4 loci and the chromosomes , we stained ﬁxed HeLa cells with DAPI and performed two - color imaging to capture cells at different stages of mitosis ( Figure 7B ) .

This mirror - image relationship was maintained when the two daughter cells formed in both ﬁxed and live - cell experiments ( Figure 7 ) . This phenomenon could lead to further studies of the mirror symmetry of initial chromosome packaging in the two daughter cells ( Gerlich et al . , 2003 ) .

Here we report an imaging technique based on an optimized CRISPR / Cas system to ﬂuorescently label speciﬁc genomic loci . We have shown that , simply by using site - speciﬁc sgRNAs , an EGFP - tagged dCas9 allows highly ﬂexible and effective detection of both repetitive and nonrepetitive elements in the human genome . This genomic labeling by CRISPR is non - destructive , allowing the observation of native chromatin dy - namics . Our data suggest that CRISPR imaging enables a new approach to study chromatin conformation and dynamics in both short time frames and long - term processes such as mitosis . While FISH requires denaturation of the DNA and is thus incompatible with live imaging , CRISPR imaging allows direct recording of real - time dynamic events . With ﬂexible DNA sequence recognition , CRISPR imaging does not rely on tar - geted insertion of artiﬁcial sequences such as LacO or TetO arrays , which are often challenging to implement and maintain . Compared to transcription activator - like effector ( TALE ) based systems that have recently been applied to image repetitive sequences in telomere and satellite DNA ( Miyanari et al . , 2013 ) , the Watson - Crick base pairing mechanism for CRISPR targeting makes our method powerful enough to detect nonrepetitive sequences . The target sequence ﬂexibility of CRISPR may enable genome - wide imaging studies in living cells . Although previous studies have reported off - target binding and editing of the CRISPR system in the human genome ( Hsu et al . , 2013 ) , our method could ﬁlter such sporadic off - target events through a local enrichment of the ﬂuorescence signal . This conclusion is supported by our observation of no puncta in the sgGAL4 negative control . As an even stronger piece of evidence , none of the MUC4 or MUC1 images contained a puncta number higher than the actual gene copy number despite the wide variety of sgRNAs used . The Improved CRISPR System Enhances the Efﬁciency of Imaging , Gene Regulation , and Likely Genome Editing Our CRISPR imaging technique has also provided opportunities to understand and improve the CRISPR system itself . In our ex - periments , we revealed that unbound dCas9 is enriched in the nucleolus , presumably by nonspeciﬁc interaction with other RNAs or genomic loci . Such nucleolar signal was reduced by us - ing ours optimized sgRNA design for more efﬁcient expression A B 0 min 45 min 90 min 135 min Prophase Metaphase Anaphase Telophase Dynamic movement of MUC4 gene through mitosis G2 M G1 M MUC4 MUC4 DAPI Figure 7 .

This observation provides strong evidence that a major limitation of CRISPR efﬁ - cacy in mammalian cells is sgRNA stability and folding . Further - more , the redesigned sgRNA also improved the CRISPRi effects by up to 5 - fold . It is possible that this new sgRNA , by eliminating nonspeciﬁc binding in the nucleolus , can also improve the efﬁ - cacy for gene editing , with less off - target effects . Cas9 variants from different bacterial species pair only with their cognate guide RNAs , and each guide RNA can be designed to recognize a distinct target sequence ( Esvelt et al . , 2013 ) . Fusion of dCas9 variants with different ﬂuorescent proteins therefore should allow labeling of multiple genomic sequences within a genome , enabling multicolor imaging for multiplexed detection of genetic events . Future engineering of the CRISPR system may also enable the detection of RNAs in addition to genomic DNAs . CRISPR Imaging Allows Direct Visualization of Genetic Element Dynamics As demonstrated by our analysis of MUC4 loci position distribu - tion ( Figure 6A ) , a straightforward application of CRISPR imaging is to monitor the position of speciﬁc genomic loci in the nucleus , which is an important mechanism for gene regulation ( Misteli , 2007 ) . While this measurement has been traditionally done by FISH or LacO labeling ( Heun et al . , 2001 ) , CRISPR imaging en - ables continuous tracking of endogenous loci over a long time period . Colocalization analysis with other nuclear landmarks such as transcription factories , nuclear pore complex , nuclear lamina , and heterochromatin markers may provide further in - sights into how the spatial organization of genes regulates its expression . The uncovering of the aneuploidy of our RPE and HeLa cell lines by CRISPR imaging ( Figure 2 ) illustrates its capability to monitor the gene copy number in living cells . This ability could provide a way to visualize gene deletions or duplications , events commonly occurring in cancers . Transposition and chromosome translocation events ( Roukos et al . , 2013 ) could conceivably also be recorded . The human genome contains large numbers of repetitive elements such as telomeres , centromeres , and satellite DNAs . Our study has shown the application of CRISPR imaging to follow the dynamics of telomeres during telomere elongation ( Figure 4 ) . Previously , such live telomere experiments have relied on introduction of ﬂuorescently tagged telomere - binding pro - teins such as TRF1 ( Wang et al . , 2008 ) , which could potentially perturb binding or localization of other proteins in the same com - plex . The same is true for imaging centromeres and other genomic loci bound by multi - protein complexes . CRISPR imag - ing allows direct detection of these loci without overexpression of individual DNA - binding components , avoiding perturbation of the stoichiometry . CRISPR Imaging Provides a Powerful Tool to Study Chromatin Architecture and Nuclear Organization How chromatin ultrastructure regulate gene expression is an unsolved question in cell biology . Given our capability to simulta - neously label multiple positions within the same MUC4 gene locus ( Figure 3C ) , we should be able to characterize the local compaction state of the labeled chromatin segment . Such ex - periments have previously been limited to LacO - labeled bacte - rial artiﬁcial chromosomes ( Sinclair et al . , 2010 ) . In contrast , CRISPR imaging will shed light on the packaging of endogenous genomic loci and may eventually enable mapping of the whole genome with an sgRNA library . Superresolution microscopy will further unveil sequence - speciﬁc chromatin ultrastructure . Of note , our imaging of the highly heterochromatic telomeres also suggests that dCas9 can access heterochromatin regions of the genome . Therefore , CRISPR imaging offers a powerful tool to understand the control of heterochromatin formation ( Grewal and Jia , 2007 ) . For example , at the whole - chromosome scale , CRISPR imaging can be instrumental in the study of X chromosome inactivation ( Augui et al . , 2011 ; Meyer , 2010 ) . Our simultaneous imaging of MUC1 and MUC4 gene loci ( Fig - ure 3D ) illustrates the capability of CRISPR imaging to monitor the spatial relationship between different genomic elements . In many cases , long - range DNA interactions are involved in regu - lating gene expression ( Fraser and Bickmore , 2007 ) . CRISPR imaging provides an opportunity to visualize such interactions between a target gene and distant regulatory elements , allowing investigation of the underlying driving forces . Such studies will be further enhanced by the development of multicolor imaging capability . For this application , CRISPR imaging is fully comple - mentary to chromatin conformation capture ( 3C ) and its derived methods 5C , hi - C , etc . ( van Steensel and Dekker , 2010 ) . Although CRISPR imaging has lower sequence throughput and sequence resolution , it readily measures individual cell - to - cell variations and adds superior spatiotemporal resolution . Using CRISPR imaging , we have imaged the MUC4 loci at different times through the cell cycle . We were able to distinguish replicated MUC4 loci , the pairing of sister chromatid MUC4 loci , and the dynamics of MUC4 loci during mitosis . These observa - tions may allow the measurement of replication timing , sister chromatid cohesion , as well as chromosome condensation and decondensation during mitosis . Labeling different genomic loci with CRISPR could map speciﬁc DNA sequences for genomic organization during cell division . Moreover , studies of homologous pairing and recombination in meiosis should also be amenable using this approach . A Uniﬁed CRISPR System for Genome Engineering Including Editing , Regulation , and Imaging CRISPR has recently been developed for genome editing and gene expression in a broad range of organisms . In addition to modifying the genome sequence and modulating gene expres - sion , here we add another application of CRISPR : its use to directly image the spatial organization and temporal interactions of chromatin . The use of the same type II CRISPR system might greatly simplify the rules and efforts for different tasks in genome engineering and imaging , as the same set of sgRNAs can be modularly combined with different versions of Cas9—a nuclease Cas9 ( genome engineering ) , a transcription factor - fused dCas9 ( gene regulation ) , or a ﬂuorescent protein - tagged dCas9 ( live chromatin imaging ) . Furthermore , with the characterization of orthogonal Cas9 proteins , it is possible to create a uniﬁed CRISPR platform for using different Cas9s and cognate sgRNAs to perform these various tasks of genomic manipulation and Cell 155 , 1479 – 1491 , December 19 , 2013 ª 2013 Elsevier Inc . 1489 observation in the same cell . We believe that such molecular tools will be invaluable to understand , interrogate , and engineer genomes , and are suitable for numerous applications for biomedical research and clinical therapies . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Plasmid Construction The DNA sequence encoding the dCas9 gene with inactivating D10A and H840A mutations was fused with EGFP and two copies of SV40 NLS . Using standard ligation - independent cloning , we cloned these fusion proteins into a lentiviral vector containing an inducible promoter P TRE3G ( Tet - on 3G induc - ible expression system , Clontech ) . sgRNAs were cloned into a lentiviral U6 - based expression vector derived from pSico , which coexpresses mCherry and a puromycin resistance cassette from a CMV promoter ( Larson et al . , 2013 ) .
