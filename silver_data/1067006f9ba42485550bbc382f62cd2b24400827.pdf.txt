The deformation of the cell membrane is produced by the activity of various proteins that curve the mem - brane inwards or outwards , by exerting pulling and pushing forces or by imposing membrane curvature via structural effects . When cells take up external material , it is often associated with membrane invaginations followed by vesicle transport . This process is called endocytosis . Such inward deformation of the cell membrane can be initiated by specific proteins , such as clathrin , which coat the mem - brane and impose geometrical constraints that bend the membrane inwards . In this view , the action of the actin cytoskeleton , a filamen - tous network that forms at the membrane , is crucial only at a later stage for membrane elongation . Nevertheless , correlation methods revealed unambiguously that , in yeast , membrane bending is not triggered by the presence of coat proteins , but by a dynamic actin network formed at the membrane through the Arp2 / 3 complex branching agent 1 – 3 . In mammalian cells , clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis requires the involvement of actin if the plasma membrane is tense ( for example , following osmotic swelling or mechanical stretching 4 ) . However , the exact mechanism of membrane defor - mation in this process is still poorly understood . Strikingly , the same type of branched actin network is able to bend the membrane the other way in , creating outward - pointing membrane deforma - tions , called dendritic filopodia . These structures are precursors of dendritic spines in neurons , and essential for signal transmission 5 . Dendritic filopodia differ from conventional filopodia , localized at the leading edge of the cell , where actin filaments are parallel . Whereas the pioneering work of Liu et al . 6 already established how thin filopodia form by bundling actin filaments , the production of a dendritic filopodia - like membrane protrusion containing a branched actin network has never been investigated . How the same branched actin structure can be responsible for the initiation of filopodia , which are outward - pointing membrane deformations , as well as endocytic invaginations that deform the membrane inward is what we want to address in this paper . Such a question is difficult to investigate in cells that contain redundant mechanisms for cell deformation . Actin dynamics triggered at a liposome membrane provide a control on experimental parameters such as membrane composition , curvature and tension , and allow the specific role of actin dynamics to be addressed . We unambigu - ously show that the same branched actin network is able to produce both endocytosis - like and dendritic filopodia - like deformations . With a theoretical model , we predict under which conditions the stress exerted on the membrane will lead to inward - and / or out - ward - pointing membrane deformations . Combining experiments and theory allows us to decipher how the interplay between mem - brane tension , actin dynamics and actin network structure produces inward or outward membrane deformations . Membrane tubes and spikes Liposomes are covered with an activator of the Arp2 / 3 complex , pVCA , the proline - rich domain – verprolin homology – central – acidic sequence from human WASP , which is purified with a strep - tavidin tag , and that we call hereafter S - pVCA . A branched actin network grows at their surface when placed in a mixture containing monomeric actin , profilin the Arp2 / 3 complex and capping protein ( CP ) ( ‘reference condition’ , Methods and Fig . 1a ) . Strikingly , the membrane of liposomes is not smooth , but instead displays a rugged profile : membrane tubes , hereafter called ‘tubes’ , radiate from the liposome surface and extend into the actin network ( Fig . 1b ) , even when comet formation has occurred 7 , 8 ( Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . The initiation of these tubes is reminiscent of the early stage of Actin dynamics drive cell - like membrane deformation Camille Simon 1 , 2 , 6 , Rémy Kusters 1 , 2 , 6 , Valentina Caorsi 1 , 2 , 6 , Antoine Allard 1 , 2 , 3 , Majdouline Abou - Ghali 1 , 2 , John Manzi 1 , 2 , Aurélie Di Cicco 1 , 2 , Daniel Lévy 1 , 2 , Martin Lenz 4 , Jean - François Joanny 1 , 2 , 5 , Clément Campillo 3 , Julie Plastino 1 , 2 , Pierre Sens 1 , 2 , 7 * and Cécile Sykes 1 , 2 , 7 * Cell membrane deformations are crucial for proper cell function . Specialized protein assemblies initiate inward or outward membrane deformations that the cell uses respectively to uptake external substances or probe the environment . The assem - bly and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton are involved in this process , although their detailed role remains controversial . We show here that a dynamic , branched actin network is sufficient to initiate both inward and outward membrane deformation . The polymerization of a dense actin network at the membrane of liposomes produces inward membrane bending at low ten - sion , while outward deformations are robustly generated regardless of tension . Our results shed light on the mechanism cells use to internalize material , both in mammalian cells , where actin polymerization forces are required when membrane tension is increased , and in yeast , where those forces are necessary to overcome the opposing turgor pressure . By combining experimen - tal observations with physical modelling , we propose a mechanism that explains how membrane tension and the architecture of the actin network regulate cell - like membrane deformations .

Interestingly , some liposomes display another type of membrane deformation , characterized by a conical shape ( hereaf - ter referred to as ‘spikes’ ) that points towards the liposome inte - rior ( Fig . 1b ) ; these spikes are reminiscent of dendritic filopodia structures in cells . Some of the liposomes carry both tubes and spikes , while others are ‘undetermined’ , as no membrane deforma - tion is visually detectable ( Fig . 1b ) . Spikes have a wide base of a few micrometres and a length that spans at least half of the lipo - some diameter . In contrast , tubes are thin , with a diameter under the resolution limit of optical microscopy ( less than a few hun - dred nanometres ) . When membrane tension is unaffected , 63 . 0 % of liposomes display only tubes , 2 . 3 % only spikes , while 6 . 1 % of liposomes carry a mix of both , and 28 . 6 % are undetermined ( Fig . 1c , non - deflated liposomes ) . To examine how membrane tension affects the occurrence of tubes and spikes , liposomes are deflated by a hyper - osmotic shock ( Methods ) before actin polym - erization is triggered . This treatment leads to a huge increase in the number of liposomes displaying spikes : 65 . 0 % of deflated lipo - somes display spikes ( with or without tubes ) , compared to 8 . 4 % in non - deflated conditions ( Fig . 1c , P < 0 . 0001 ) . Yet , the frequency with which tubes ( with or without spikes ) are observed is essen - tially unaffected : 69 . 1 % for non - deflated liposomes compared to 74 . 8 % for deflated liposomes ( not significant , P = 0 . 24 > 0 . 05 , Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . An increase in membrane tension by a hypo - osmotic treatment ( Methods ) does not change the occur - rence of tubes and spikes significantly ( Supplementary Fig . 1c ) . Membrane tubes and spikes exclusively rely on the presence of the actin network , as they disappear when the network is destructed 7 Lipid bilayer Biotin PEG Arp2 / 3 Streptavidin pVCA F - actin Actin sub - units Capping proteins Phase contrast Membrane Actin Overlay U nde t e r m i ned T ube s T ube s and s p i k e s S p i k e s B e f o r e A ft e r Non - deflated liposome Added sucrose Deflatedliposome H 2 O H 2 O H 2 O H 2 O UndeterminedTubes Tubes and spikes Spikes 100 80 60 N o . o f li po s o m e s ( % ) 40 20 0 Non - deflated liposomes Deflatedliposomes Phase contrast Actin Membrane t = 0 s t = 60 s B e f o r e A ft e r Phase contrast Actin Membrane t = 0 s t = 45 s a b c d e Fig . 1 | experimental system and observations . a , Scheme of the experimental system ; proteins not to scale . b , Membrane deformations in both non - deflated ( first three rows ) and deflated conditions ( last row ) . c , Top : liposome deflation .

A possible effect of membrane pre - curva - ture induced by pVCA attachment to the membrane is ruled out ( Supplementary Information and Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Characterization of tubes To assess where new actin monomers are incorporated during tube growth , we incorporate differently labelled monomers ( green ) after 20 min ( Methods ) . As previously observed for actin networks grow - ing around polystyrene beads 9 , 10 , new monomers insert at the lipo - some surface ( Fig . 2a ) . Strikingly , new ( green ) monomers are also observed within the already grown ( red ) actin network ( Fig . 2a ) , indicating new actin incorporation on the sides of membrane tubes ( tubes are evidenced by phase - contrast imaging , Fig . 2a , top ) . This observation is confirmed by the localization , along tubes and at the liposome surface , of S - pVCA ( Fig . 2b ) , the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 2c ) and free barbed ends ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Moreover , the pres - ence of the Arp2 / 3 complex everywhere in the whole volume of the actin network demonstrates its dentritic nature ( Fig . 2c ) . We find that the average length of the longest tubes increases linearly with network thickness ( Fig . 3a , b ) . In fact , maximal tube length roughly equals the thickness of the actin network , inde - pendently of membrane tension ( Fig . 3b , slope 0 . 89 ± 0 . 04 ) , albeit deflated liposomes produce a smaller actin cortex . Moreover , we find that tubes grow simultaneously with the actin network ( Fig . 3c , d and Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . Tubes shorter than the net - work thickness are also present , as evidenced by confocal micros - copy ( Supplementary Fig . 5a ) . The origin of the accumulation of membrane fluorescence detected at the tip of some of the longer tubes is unclear . We observe that S - pVCA forms aggregates on membranes and sticks membranes together , even in the absence of actin ( Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . It is possible that small vesicles are attached via S - pVCA to the membrane before polymerization starts and are pushed outward by actin growth . However , the presence of different tube lengths ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) rules out the possibility that tubes could be formed only by pre - existing attached vesicles . Characterization of spikes We find that new actin is incorporated at the tips of the spikes as well as at the sides ( Fig . 4a ) , consistent with the localization of S - pVCA ( Fig . 4b ) . Spikes are filled with the Arp2 / 3 complex and CP ( Fig . 4c and Supplementary Fig . 7 ) , characteristic of a branched network . A clump of actin is observable at the base of the spikes ( Fig . 4d ) . The thickness of the clump bears no clear correlation with the length of the spikes ( Supplementary Fig . 8a ) , but slightly corre - lates with their width ( Supplementary Fig . 8b ) . Spikes initially elon - gate with time until polymerization slows down ; the basal width of spikes , however , remains roughly constant over time ( Fig . 4e and Supplementary Fig . 8c ) . effect of network mesh size and membrane tension Lowering the Arp2 / 3 complex or CP concentrations could , in prin - ciple , result in loosening the network , but fails to form a cohesive thick enough ( > 500 nm ) network 11 . Using the property of profilin to inhibit branching and therefore loosen the actin network 12 , we obtain a visible , thick , network comparable to reference conditions ( Supplementary Fig . 9a and Methods ) . We find that the occurrence of tubes is reduced in these conditions ( 74 . 8 % of liposomes display tubes when profilin is in excess compared to 91 . 4 % in reference conditions , Supplementary Fig . 9b , P < 0 . 0001 ) . Strikingly , decreas - ing membrane tension in loosened network conditions signifi - cantly increases the presence of tubes and spikes ( Supplementary Fig . 9b , P < 0 . 0001 ) . theoretical models for spikes and tubes The appearance of large - scale membrane deformations ( spikes ) driven by a uniformly polymerizing actin network is rationalized using analytical modelling and numerical finite - element calcula - tions ( Methods ) . The actin network behaves as a viscoelastic mate - rial with an elastic behaviour at short time and a viscous behaviour at long time due to network rearrangement , the crossover time being on the order of 1 – 10 s ( refs . 13 – 15 ) . We focus on the viscous behaviour as the growth of the network occurs on timescales of tens of minutes . We model the growth of the actin network with a uniform actin polymerization velocity v g normal to the liposome mem - brane ( motivated by Fig . 4a ) and solve the hydrodynamic force balance equation at low Reynolds number ( the ‘Stokes equation’ ) ( Methods ) .

Small perturbations of membrane shape modulate the actin velocity field and generate viscous stress on the membrane . For a periodic deformation ( Fig . 5a , left ) , the actin stress varies as the square of the deformation amplitude ( Methods ) in agree - ment with actin growth on a curved surface 13 , 16 . For a localized ( Gaussian ) membrane perturbation = − ∕ u x A ( ) e x b ( ) 2 with ampli - tude A and width b ( Fig . 5a , right ) , we calculate the pressure and velocity fields in the actin layer numerically ( Fig . 5b ) . Velocity gradients in the growing actin layer , generated by the deformed surface , induce a normal pushing force at the centre of the per - turbation , and pulling forces at the periphery of the perturba - tion ( Fig . 5c ) , that amount to a zero net force when integrated over the deformation area . This contrasts with existing models of filopodia formation , which usually consider bundled actin fila - ments exerting a net pushing force on the membrane that do not precisely address the force balance within the actin network 6 , 17 , 18 . Here , we do not a priori distinguish the detailed structure of the actin network at the membrane from the one in the protrusion , treating the actin network as a continuum . A scaling analysis of the Stokes equation , confirmed by our numerical calculation , leads to a normal stress at the centre of the perturbation ( x = 0 ) that scales as σ nn ≈ − η A 2 b − 3 v g , where η is the viscosity of the actin layer ( Supplementary Fig . 10a , b ) . An intuitive understanding of this scaling behaviour is given in the Supplementary Information . The normal stress σ nn is balanced by the membrane elastic restor - ing stress 19 σ γ κ = − + ∂ C C memb s 2 , where γ is the membrane tension , κ is the bending rigidity , C is the membrane curvature ( ~ A / b 2 ) and ∂ s the curvilinear derivative ( ~ 1 / b ) . Considering that b is larger than the characteristic length γ κ γ = ∕ , the stress is dominated by mem - brane tension . The balance of actin polymerization and membrane stresses defines a threshold amplitude A * = γ b / ( η v g ) . When the amplitude of the perturbation is smaller than this threshold ( A < A * ) the membrane stress dominates and the perturbation relaxes . Above the threshold ( A > A * ) the force exerted by the network is domi - nant and the instability develops . We now evaluate whether such a perturbation could be reached by thermal fluctuations character - ized by the Boltzmann constant k B and the temperature T .

This value is in the range of membrane tension for non - deflated liposomes 21 , but is larger than the tension of deflated liposomes , leading to the prediction that deflated liposomes are prone to the formation of spikes , in agreement with our experimental results ( Fig . 1c ) . Spike initiation also depends on the structure of the actin network through the value of the network viscosity η . Using the relationship 22 η ≈ k B Tl p τ ve / ξ 4 , with l p being the persistence length of the actin filament ( ~ 10 μ m ) 23 , we find the following condition for spike initiation : γξ τ κ < π k Tl v k T 2 ( 1 ) ve 4 B p g B In contrast to ‘thin’ spike - like protrusions 6 , the spikes we consider here are formed by the growth of a branched network with a uni - form polymerization along the liposome membrane ( Fig . 4 ) . The compressive stress resulting from actin polymerization ( shown in Fig . 5b ) explains that spikes are much wider than the ones previ - ously observed 6 , and that they grow faster than the surrounding actin layer ( Supplementary Information and Fig . 4 ) . The initiation of membrane tubes in the reference condi - tion requires a pulling force at the tip of the tube larger than κγ = π ≈ f 2 2 2 pN tube ( refs . 24 , 25 ; Fig . 5d with the above estimates ) . The tube radius ( κ γ = ∕ ≈ r ( 2 ) 20 nm tube ) is smaller than the size of the actin mesh through which it is pulled . This situation differs from spikes where the flow of the actin network is enslaved to the shape of the membrane , thus generating a wider deformation . In our case , tube pulling requires physical attachment of the actin to the membrane through the activator pVCA 26 . The force exerted by the growth of the actin network ( moving away from the liposome surface at a velocity v g ) on the filament bound to the tip of the tube ( moving at a velocity ̇ L ) is equiva - lent to a friction force ( Supplementary Information ) , which can be crudely estimated using the Stokes law : η = π − ̇ f r v L 6 ( ) drag tube g ( Fig . 5e ) .

Note that ̇ ≳ . L v 0 9 g , explaining why tubes initiated early during actin growth actually span the entire actin layer . A tenfold increase of membrane tension could in principle prevent tube for - mation . Hypo - tonic treatment does not change the occurrence of tubes ( Supplementary Fig . 1c ) , suggesting that the tension does not reach a sufficiently high level under these conditions . Using the relationship 22 η ≈ k B Tl p τ ve / ξ 4 the condition for tube extraction is : γξ τ < k Tl v 3 2 ( 2 ) e 4 B p g v ( Supplementary Fig . 10d ) . Increasing the actin mesh size indeed significantly reduces the occurrence of membrane tubes ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . Omitting CP , in principle , also decreases network mesh size , and no membrane tubes have been reported in these conditions 6 , 27 . In yeast , actin is absolutely required for endo - cytosis , probably because of the high turgor pressure that opposes inward membrane deformations 28 – 30 . The force needed to overcome the turgor pressure can reach 1 , 000 pN 31 , almost three orders of magnitude larger than the actin force in our in vitro conditions . Using yeast - relevant parameters for actin dynamics ( polymerization velocity v p = 50 nm s − 1 ( ref . 1 ) and actin network viscosity η = 10 5 Pa s as estimated from the same scaling law as above and with a Young’s modulus E ≈ 10 4 Pa , for an actin network in cell extracts 32 and τ ve ≈ 10 s ) , the drag force generated by the actin network on a tube of radius r = 10 nm is on the nanoNewton order . It is thus in prin - ciple able to overcome the turgor pressure and to trigger membrane deformation leading to endocytosis ( Supplementary Information ) . The cell is a robust system where redundant mechanisms ensure proper function , which makes detailed cell mechanisms difficult to decipher . This is true for membrane deformations into filopodia 5 or endocytic intermediates 1 . Here , we show that a branched actin net - work growing at a membrane is able to mimic the initiation of either an endocytosis - like or a dendritic filopodia - like deformation . Our results support recent findings that the initiation of dendritic filo - podia and endocytosis primarily relies on the growth of a branched actin network 1 , 3 , 5 . Endocytosis is intimately dependent on the existence of a physical link between the actin network and the plasma membrane in yeast as well as in mammalian cells under high cell tension . Controlled endocytosis is abolished in yeast if this link is suppressed , although already endocytosed vesicles retain their extraordinary capacity to polymerize actin and even undergo actin - based motility 3 , 33 . In our reconstituted system , the membrane – pVCA – network linkage is essential to produce tubes , as the absence of one of these links pre - cludes tubular membrane deformation ( Supplementary Information , Supplementary Fig . 2a and Fig . 5d ) . In fact , the pVCA region interacts with branched actin networks both through the binding of the Arp2 / 3 complex 26 and through tethering of actin filament free barbed ends 34 . Note that another form of pVCA was shown to induce clustering and phase separation of lipids in the absence of CP , but not membrane deformations 26 . Here we show that , through our membrane – pVCA – network linkage , actin dynamics alone have the remarkable capac - ity to initiate endocytosis - like membrane deformations with a width smaller than , or of the order of , the actin mesh size . A class of model for filopodia initiation assumes a particular actin organization in the protrusion , typically that of bundled actin filaments 6 , 17 , 18 , 35 , 36 . Supported by our dual - colour actin measurements and by labelling of the Arp2 / 3 complex and CP , our model for spike initiation assumes that actin polymerization occurs uniformly at the membrane , which indicates that new actin is incorporated all along the conical membrane surface , and not only at the tip of the protru - sion as observed by Liu et al . 6 . Moreover , our characterization reveals that the actin network is branched during the entire growth process . Decreasing membrane tension decreases the critical amplitude for spike nucleation and increases the likelihood of spike formation ( Fig . 6 ) oppositely to thin actin filament protrusions 6 , thus reveal - ing the very different nature of these two types of protrusion , both in their initiation , and in their subsequent growth dynamics . Spikes are mimics of filopodia , especially in the case of dendritic filopodia whose formation relies on the Arp2 / 3 complex - branched network 37 . Our experimental and theoretical results are summarized in Fig . 6 , where the thresholds for spike and tube formation ( equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ) are shown together with the explored experimental condi - tions . We conclude that tubes and spikes coexist at low tension or low mesh size whereas we predict that they do not form at high ten - sion and high mesh size . At intermediate tension and mesh size , only tubes form , but not spikes . We thus highlight how membrane defor - mations induced by actin polymerization can be modulated by the interplay between membrane tension and actin network mesh size .

Texas Red 1 , 2 - dipalmitoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine , triethylammonium salt is from Thermofisher . Actin is purchased from Cytoskeleton and used with no further purification . Fluorescent Alexa Fluor 488 actin conjugate and Alexa Fluor 546 actin conjugate are obtained from Molecular Probes . Porcine Arp2 / 3 complex is purchased from Cytoskeleton and used with no further purification . Biotin is purchased from Sigma - Aldrich , diluted in dimethylsulfoxide . Mouse α 1 β 2 CP is purified as in ref . 38 . Untagged human profilin and S - pVCA ( the pVCA sequence starts at amino acid Gln 150 ) are purified as in ref . 8 . S - pVCA is fluorescently labelled on the amino - terminal amine with Alexa Fluor 546 at pH 6 . 5 for 2 h at 4 °C , desalted and then purified on a Superdex 200 column . His – pVCA – GST ( GST – pVCA ) is purified as for PRD – VCA – WAVE 39 and His – pVCA is essentially the same without the glutathione Sepharose step . Mouse α 1 β 2 CP is fluorescently labelled with Alexa Fluor 488 C 5 - maleimide ( ratio of 1 : 1 protein / label ) for 1 h at room temperature and then at 4 °C overnight under agitation . Porcine Arp2 / 3 complex is fluorescently labelled with Alexa Fluor 488 C 5 - maleimide ( ratio of 1 : 10 protein / label ) at pH 7 . 2 for 3 h on ice and then purified on a PD Minitrap G - 25 column . A solution of 30 μ M monomeric actin containing 15 % of labelled Alexa Fluor 488 actin conjugate is obtained by incubating the actin solution in G - Buffer ( 2 mM Tris , 0 . 2 mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) , 0 . 2 mM ATP , pH 8 . 0 ) overnight at 4 °C . All proteins ( S - pVCA , profilin , CP , actin ) are mixed in the isotonic , hypertonic or hypotonic working buffer . The isotonic working buffer contains 25 mM imidazole , 70 mM sucrose , 1 mM Tris , 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM DTT , 1 . 6 mM ATP , 0 . 02 mg ml − 1 β - casein , adjusted to pH 7 . 4 . The hypertonic , isotonic and hypotonic working buffers differ only by their sucrose concentration ( hypertonic : 320 mM sucrose ; isotonic : 70 mM sucrose ; hypotonic : no sucrose ) . Osmolarities of the hypertonic , isotonic and hypotonic working buffers are respectively 400 , 200 and 95 mOsmol , as measured with a vapour pressure osmometer ( VAPRO 5600 ) . In the case of experiments with DOGS - NTA - Ni lipids , all proteins are diluted in a working buffer containing 280 mM glucose , 10 mM HEPES , 0 . 5 mM DABCO , 100 mM KCl , 4 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT , 10 mM ATP and 0 . 05 mg ml − 1 β - casein . Liposome preparation . Liposomes are prepared using the electroformation technique . Briefly , 10 μ l of a mixture of EPC lipids , 0 . 1 % biotinylated lipids or 5 % DOGS - NTA - Ni lipids , and 0 . 1 % Texas Red lipids with a concentration of 2 . 5 mg ml − 1 in chloroform / methanol 5 : 3 ( v / v ) are spread onto indium tin oxide ( ITO ) - coated plates under vacuum for 2 h . A chamber is formed using the ITO plates ( their conductive sides facing each other ) filled with a sucrose buffer ( 0 . 2 M sucrose , 2 mM Tris - adjusted at pH 7 . 4 ) and sealed with haematocrit paste ( Vitrex Medical ) . Liposomes are formed by applying an alternating current voltage ( 10 Hz , 1 V ) for 2 h . Liposomes are then incubated with an activator of actin polymerization ( S - pVCA , 350 nM ) via a streptavidin – biotin link for 15 min . Isotonic liposomes are used right away for polymerizing actin in the isotonic working buffer . To obtain deflated or tense liposomes , an extra step is added : they are diluted twice in the hypertonic ( 400 mOsmol ) or hypotonic ( 95 mOsmol ) working buffer respectively and incubated for 30 min . The final solution is therefore at 300 mOsmol or 110 mOsmol respectively . Biotin - blocking experiments . S - pVCA labelled with Alexa Fluor 546 and biotin are diluted in the isotonic working buffer and incubated for 10 min to reach a final concentration of 350 nM S - pVCA and various concentrations of biotin ( 87 . 5 nM , 175 nM , 262 . 5 nM , 350 nM ) . Note that 350 nM of biotin corresponds to a full saturation of the streptavidin sites of S - pVCA . Unlabelled liposomes ( 99 . 9 % EPC lipids , 0 . 1 % biotinylated lipids ) are then diluted twice in this solution and incubated for 15 min . Tubes and spikes are visualized by the fluorescence of S - pVCA . Actin cortices with a branched network . Our condition of reference ( ‘reference condition’ ) corresponds to condition 1 and non - deflated liposomes . In condition 1 , actin polymerization is triggered by diluting the non - deflated , deflated or tense liposomes 6 times in a mix of respectively isotonic , hypertonic or hypotonic working buffer containing final concentrations of 3 μ M monomeric actin ( 15 % fluorescently labelled with Alexa Fluor 488 ) , 3 μ M profilin , 37 nM Arp2 / 3 complex , 25 nM CP . Note that the final concentrations of salt and ATP in all conditions ( isotonic , hypertonic , hypotonic ) are 0 . 3 mM NaCl , 41 mM KCl , 1 . 6 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 02 mM CaCl 2 and 1 . 5 mM ATP . Condition 2 follows the same protocol as in condition 1 with unlabelled monomeric actin , unlabelled liposomes ( 99 . 9 % EPC lipids , 0 . 1 % biotinylated lipids ) and S - pVCA labelled with Alexa Fluor 546 . In Fig . 1c , non - deflated liposomes n = 311 are distributed as follows : 215 from 3 experiments in condition 1 and 96 from 2 experiments in condition 2 . Deflated liposomes n = 123 are distributed as follows : 92 from 2 experiments in condition 1 and 31 from 1 experiment in condition 2 . Condition 3 follows the same protocol as in condition 1 with unlabelled monomeric actin and Arp2 / 3 complex labelled with Alexa Fluor 488 C 5 - maleimide . Condition 4 follows the same protocol as in condition 1 with unlabelled monomeric actin and CP labelled with Alexa Fluor 488 C 5 - maleimide . Actin cortices with a loosened branched network . Actin polymerization is triggered the same way as above ( condition 1 ) , except with 15 μ M profilin ( instead of 3 ) , and during a longer time ( overnight instead of 1 – 2 h ) . Reference conditions correspond to non - deflated liposomes in condition 1 , except that observation is performed 20 h after the initiation of polymerization . Photo - damage of the actin network . The actin network area to photo - damage is defined with a diaphragm . The area is illuminated for 15 s with a Hg lamp and a FITC filter cube and the illumination is repeated until the actin is completely destroyed or at least no longer detectable by eye . Two - colour experiment . Liposomes are first incubated with 350 nM S - pVCA for 15 min . This solution is then diluted threefold into a mix of isotonic buffer containing 3 μ M actin ( 15 % Alexa568 - labelled , red ) , 37 nM Arp2 / 3 complex and 25 nM CP . After 20 min of incubation in these conditions , the solution is diluted 3 times in a mix of the same protein concentrations containing 15 % Alexa488 - labelled actin , green . Free actin filament barbed end labelling . S - pVCA - activated liposomes ( labelled membrane ) are placed in a mix containing 3 μ M unlabelled monomeric actin , 37 nM unlabelled Arp2 / 3 complex and 25 nM unlabelled CP . After 20 min of incubation in these conditions , the solution is diluted 5 times in the working buffer to stop actin polymerization . This solution is then incubated with 75 nM labelled CP . Image acquisition is performed right after the addition of fluorescently labelled CP . Cryo - electron microscopy . To prepare small liposomes , a mixture of EPC lipids and 0 . 1 % biotinylated lipids with a concentration of 1 mg ml − 1 in chloroform / methanol 5 : 3 ( v / v ) is dried and resuspended under vortexing in a buffer containing 25 mM imidazole , 1 mM Tris , 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM DTT , 1 . 6 mM ATP and 0 . 02 mg ml − 1 β - casein . Liposomes are then incubated with S - pVCA ( 350 nM ) for 15 min and finally flash - frozen for cryo - electron microscopy . Images were recorded under low - dose conditions with a Tecnai G2 Lab6 electron microscope operating at 200 kV with a TVIPS F416 4K camera and with a resolution of 0 . 21 Å per pixel . Observation of liposomes . For observation in two dimensions , epifluorescence ( GFP filter cube , excitation 470 nm , emission 525 nm ; Texas Red filter cube : excitation 545 – 580 nm , emission 610 nm - IR ) , phase - contrast and bright - field microscopy are performed using an IX70 Olympus inverted microscope with a 100 × or a 60 × oil - immersion objective . Images are collected by a CCD ( charge - coupled device ) camera ( CoolSnap , Photometrics , Roper Scientific ) . For observation in three dimensions : confocal and bright - field microscopy are performed using an inverted confocal spinning disc Roper / Nikon with a 100 × or a 60 × oil - immersion objective and lasers with wavelengths of 491 nm for actin and 561 nm for lipids . A FITC filter cube ( excitation filter : 478 – 495 nm / emission filter : 510 – 555 nm ) and a TxRed filter cube ( excitation filter : 560 – 580 nm / emission filter : 600 – 650 nm ) are used to acquire respectively actin and lipids fluorescence . Images are collected by a CCD camera ( CoolSnap HQ2 , Photometrics , Roper Scientific ) . For three - dimensional data , z - stacks are acquired using the software Metamorph on each wavelength with a z - interval of 0 . 5 μ m . Image analyses of liposomes , tubes and spikes . Image analyses are performed with ImageJ software and data are processed on Matlab . The thickness of the actin network and the length of the tube membranes are obtained from fluorescence intensity profiles ( Fig . 3a ) . The first peak of the membrane profile determines the liposome surface and the second peak determines the end of the membrane tube . The actin network thickness is the distance between the first peak and the half - width at half - maximum of the actin fluorescence profile . The length of the membrane tubes is obtained as the peak - to - peak distance of the membrane fluorescence profile . The size of the spikes ( length , width ) and the actin network is determined by the corresponding positions of the inflexion points . Fluorescence profiles in each case ( membrane , actin ) are fitted with a polynomial function . The first maximum and the second minimum of the fit derivative , corresponding to inflexion points of the profile , determine the membrane or actin edges . The size is then the distance between the two edges . From the actin fluorescence profile , the actin network thickness at the base of the spike is defined as the distance between the first maximum and the first minimum of the fit derivative . To determine whether shorter tubes are present in addition to the easily visualized long ones , we measure the total fluorescence intensity of the membrane on an arc that is displaced along a radial axis r from close to the liposome surface to the external part of the network . We hypothesize that tubes maintain a constant diameter along their length , as is established for pure membrane tubes 24 . In these conditions , if all tubes have the same length , the total intensity should show a plateau as a function of r , until falling off to zero at an r where there are no more NAtuRe PhySiCS | www . nature . com / naturephysics Articles NaTure PhySiCS tubes ( Supplementary Fig . 4a ) . Conversely , the total intensity would decrease as a function of r if tubes of different lengths were present ( Supplementary Fig . 4a ) . Statistical analyses . All statistical analyses are performed using MedCalc software . An N − 1 chi - squared test is used to determine the statistical significance . Differences among samples were considered statistically significant when P < 0 . 05 . Theoretical model for spike initiation . To calculate the stress exerted by a viscous network polymerizing at a curved surface we consider an incompressible Stokes flow , described by force balance and incompressibility ; that is , σ ∇→⋅→ = 0 and ∇→⋅→ = v 0 , where → v is the velocity of the network and σ → is the viscous stress in Cartesian coordinates , given by     σ η = − δ + + ∂ ∂ ∂ ∂ p ij ij v x v x i j j i . Polymerization of the actin network is encoded in this model by imposing the velocity of the network , normal to the surface of the curved interface . Moreover , we impose a stress - free boundary condition at the outer layer , both for the normal as well as the tangential stress ; that is , σ nn = 0 and σ nt = 0 . Note that , in the limit we consider , an infinitely thick network , this corresponds to a uniform velocity in the z - direction . We determine the first - order correction of the normal stress on a deformed surface characterized by u ( x ) = u 0 exp ( iqx ) along the x axis ( u 0 is the deformation amplitude and q is the wavevector ; Fig . 5a , left ) . We seek a solution for the velocity field within the network of the form v j = v j ( z ) exp ( iqx ) , where the index j represents the coordinate x or z , and a pressure field of the form p = p ( z ) exp ( iqx ) . Assuming that the network grows normal to the surface , the first - order correction of the x - component of the velocity field satisfies the boundary condition δ v x ( z = 0 ) = − v g ∂ x u ( x ) at the interface ( z = 0 ) . We assume here a network of large thickness and require that the first - order correction to the velocity vanishes at z →∞ . The first - order corrections to the velocity and pressure in the network read δ v x ( z ) = − iqu 0 ( 1 − qz ) v g exp ( − qz ) , δ v z ( z ) = − q 2 u 0 v g z exp ( − qz ) and δ p ( z ) = − 2 η q 2 u 0 v g exp ( − qz ) . At this order the actin normal stress turns out to vanish at any point of the liposome surface : σ nn ( x , z = 0 ) = 2 η ∂ z v z − p = 0 . This implies that the membrane is linearly stable against small deformations in the presence of a growing actin network . The second - order correction for the actin stress is in principle difficult to calculate , as the different modes of deformation are coupled . An analytical estimate can be obtained by expanding the surface normal vector up to second order , which yields the following scaling for the normal stress at the liposome surface , σ η ∝− q u v n n 3 02 g . This weakly nonlinear analysis reveals that there is a non - zero normal stress acting on the membrane , which we will later compare with the membrane contribution to address system stability . To get a numerical solution for the normal stress in a ‘localized’ spike - like perturbation on the interface , as opposed to the periodic one presented above , we use a finite - element method from Mathematica with default settings . We implement a geometry as described in Fig . 5a ( right ) , where the lower surface is parametrized with a Gaussian deformation as mentioned before ( that is , = − − = ( ) u x z z A ( , ) exp 0 x b 2 ) and we choose the height of the system to be much larger that the extent and amplitude of the perturbation ( h = 2 μ m ) . Note that here , b , the characteristic lateral length of the localized perturbation , is related to the wavenumber q ≈ 1 / b used for the linear analysis . To account for a constant polymerization , perpendicular to the lower surface we impose the velocity on the lower surface , that is , ∂ = = ∂ ̂ + ∂ ̂ v u x z v u x z x u x z z ( ( , ) 0 ) ( ( , ) ( , ) ) x z g , where v g is the normalized polymerization velocity , and a vanishing normal and tangential stress at the upper boundary z = h , that is , σ nn ( z = h ) = 0 and σ nt ( z = h ) = 0 . Using this approach we find the same scaling with amplitude and width of the perturbation as found for the weakly nonlinear analysis for a sinusoidal perturbation . Note also that here , by imposing the normal velocity at the interface , a choice that is motivated by the dual - colour images in Fig . 4a , we do not impose the tangential stress on the membrane , and hence this stress has to be balanced by an in - plane viscous stress in the membrane , which at this stage we do not model . These finite - element model simulations allow us to visualize the velocity field as well as the pressure throughout the network , indicating the increase in pressure inside the local perturbation caused by the local convergence of the velocity fields ( Fig . 5b ) .

Sample size Sample size was not pre - determined . However , our main result is that actin dynamics can deform a membrane . To address which physical parameter was important to this effect , we have compared different conditions with a Chi - squared test that gave satisfactory p - values that confirmed our direct observation . Data exclusions Liposomes that did not show any actin signal in fluorescence microcopy were excluded , since they were not affected by actin . Replication Experiments were repeated 2 , 3 or 5 times and displayed the same features Randomization The same batch of proteins were used in all experiments . Experiments were reproducible among two experimentalists ( CS and VC , co - first authors ) . Blinding Blinding was used among authors for analysis . Data collection was randomized in taking random images .
