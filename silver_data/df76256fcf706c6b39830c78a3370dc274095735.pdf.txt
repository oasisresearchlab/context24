Mayer ¶ ‡‡ From the ‡ Department of Cell Biology , Harvard Medical School and the ¶ Laboratory of Molecular Medicine , Children’s Hospital , Boston , Massachusetts 02115 The Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) and its relative neural WASP ( N - WASP ) regulate the nucleation of actin filaments through their interaction with the Arp2 / 3 complex and are regulated in turn by binding to GTP - bound Cdc42 and phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphos - phate . The Nck Src homology ( SH ) 2 / 3 adaptor binds via its SH3 domains to a proline - rich region on WASP and N - WASP and has been implicated in recruitment of these proteins to sites of tyrosine phosphorylation . We show here that Nck SH3 domains dramatically stimulate the rate of nucleation of actin filaments by purified N - WASP in the presence of Arp2 / 3 in vitro . All three Nck SH3 domains are required for maximal activation . Nck - stimulated actin nucleation by N - WASP z Arp2 / 3 com - plexes is further stimulated by phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate , but not by GTP - Cdc42 , suggesting that Nck and Cdc42 activate N - WASP by redundant mecha - nisms . These results suggest the existence of an Nck - de - pendent , Cdc42 - independent mechanism to induce actin polymerization at tyrosine - phosphorylated Nck binding sites . The Nck adapter protein consists of three Src homology ( SH ) 1 3 domains and one SH2 domain and has been postulated to link changes in tyrosine phosphorylation to actin assembly . The SH2 domain of Nck associates with tyrosine - phosphory - lated proteins on the cell surface , and its SH3 domains bind signaling proteins ( such as WASP , WIP , and p21 - activated kinase ) that regulate processes such as membrane ruffling , vesicle motility , and axon guidance ( 1 – 9 ) . Dock , the Drosophila homolog of Nck , is required for photoreceptor axon targeting and is localized to the growth cone ( 10 ) . In the actin - based motility of Vaccinia virus , Nck coordinates the assembly of an actin nucleation complex at the viral surface by binding to a tyrosine - phosphorylated viral protein through its SH2 domain and by recruiting neural Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein ( N - WASP ) through its SH3 domains ( 11 ) . We have previously demonstrated that N - WASP , when coordinately activated by Cdc42 and phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) , can stimulate actin nucleation through the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 12 ) . Because Vaccinia motility is independent of Cdc42 , an unan - swered question is how this phosphotyrosine - Nck pathway ac - tivates N - WASP . In this study , we demonstrate that Nck can fully activate N - WASP in cooperation with PIP 2 ( but not Cdc42 ) . Maximal activity requires all three SH3 domains of Nck . These results suggest the presence of a phosphotyrosine - Nck / PIP 2 pathway that is distinct from the previously de - scribed Cdc42 / PIP 2 pathway and provide support for the prin - ciple that WASP family proteins can integrate multiple upstream signals . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Protein Expression and Purification— Glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) fusions of human Nck1 and the various Nck fragments shown in Fig . 4 A were expressed in Escherichia coli and affinity purified on glutathione - Sepharose beads according to established protocols . For particular experiments , GST was cleaved from Nck using the PreScis - sion protease ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) following the manufac - turer’s recommendations . Purification of untagged full - length rat N - WASP and hexahistidine - tagged WGP and WG fragments produced in Sf9 cells , GST - VCA produced in E . coli , and the Arp2 / 3 complex purified from bovine brain extracts has been described previously ( 12 , 13 ) . Actin Polymerization Assays— The pyrene actin assays used to mon - itor actin polymerization in the presence of various components , as well as the methods used for data analysis , have been described in detail previously ( 13 ) . All polymerization reactions contained 1 . 0 m M unla - beled actin , 0 . 3 m M pyrene - actin ( 50 % labeled ) , 0 . 2 m M ATP , 30 n M Arp2 / 3 , 100 n M N - WASP , and various proteins at the indicated concen - trations in 80 m l of XB buffer ( 20 m M Hepes , pH 7 . 7 , 100 m M KCl , 1 m M MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 m M EDTA ) . Because the activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex by N - WASP accelerates the kinetics of polymerization by catalyzing nu - cleation , the maximum slope of these polymerization curves is an indi - cator of the extent of N - WASP activation by added components . Binding Assays— The Nck far - Western assays were performed with GST fusions labeled with glutathione - conjugated horseradish peroxi - dase ( GSH - HRP ; Sigma ) . Recombinant proteins ( N - WASP , WGP , WG , or VCA ) were separated on 12 % or 8 % SDS - polyacrylamide gel electro - phoresis , transferred to PVDF membranes , and blocked with 10 % non - fat dry milk in Tris - buffered saline with Tween ( 150 m M NaCl , 10 m M Tris 8 . 0 , 0 . 05 % Tween 20 ) at 4 °C overnight . GST fusions of Nck frag - ments , which served as probes in the binding assay , were preincubated for 30 min at room temperature with GSH - HRP ( 1 m g of SH3 domain 1 0 . 2 m g of GSH - HRP ) . The PVDF strips with immobilized N - WASP mutants were incubated with the different GSH - HRP - loaded SH3 do - mains at 4 °C for 1 h at afinal concentration of 1 m g of SH3 domain / ml * This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants GM26875 ( to M .

Strips were washed at 4 °C in Tris - buffered saline with Tween three times for 10 min each , and the bound probe was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence . For solution binding assays , 293T cells were transfected with plas - mid expressing rat N - WASP tagged at the N terminus with six tandem copies of the Myc epitope , and lysed 2 days post - transfection in TXB ( 1 % Triton X - 100 , 10 m M Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 150 m M NaCl , 5 m M EDTA , 10 % glycerol ) . Equal amounts of lysate were incubated at 4 °C with 10 m l of glutathione - Sepharose beads ( Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ) pre - bound to 5 m g of GST or the molar equivalent of GST - Nck fusion proteins . After 1 h the beads were washed 3 times in lysis buffer , resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer , split into two aliquots , and separated by SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on duplicate 10 % gels . One gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue , and the other was transferred to PVDF membrane and immunoblotted with mono - clonal anti - Myc antibody ( 9E10 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Given the published observation that Nck can physically associate with WASP ( and likely N - WASP ) through its SH3 domains , we used an established pyrene - actin assay system to test whether recombinant GST - Nck could stimulate the ability of N - WASP to activate the Arp2 / 3 complex ( 3 , 14 ) . GST - Nck alone could activate N - WASP in a dose - dependent , saturable fashion ( Fig . 1 ) . The concentration of GST - Nck required for half - maximal activation ( K act or potency ) was ; 80 n M , and the maximum polymerization rate ( P max or efficacy ) at saturating concentrations of GST - Nck was ; 4 - fold higher than that for the unactivated reaction . The SH3 - SH2 - SH3 adapter protein Grb2 has also been shown to activate N - WASP with a similar K act ( 100 – 200 n M ) ( 15 ) . In the presence of 10 m M PIP 2 - contain - ing vesicles , which have minimal effects on N - WASP activity on their own , the P max for GST - Nck increased dramatically to over 30 - fold above the unactivated reaction whereas the K act stayed at ; 80 n M ( Fig . 1 ) . Thus , Nck and PIP 2 vesicles can synergis - tically activate N - WASP in a manner similar to that previously demonstrated for Cdc42 and PIP 2 ( 12 ) . The requirement for two signals for N - WASP activation reinforces the emerging princi - ple that WASP family proteins sit at integration points in signaling networks ( 13 ) . We have confirmed that activation of N - WASP by Nck is not dependent on GST , because GST - fused F IG . 1 . Nck and PIP 2 synergistically activate N - WASP . A , the pyrene actin assay was used to compare the abilities of GST - Nck , PIP 2 vesicles ( 10 m M ; PIP 2 : phosphatidylinositol : phosphatidylcholine 5 10 : 45 : 45 ) , or both together to activate actin polymerization ( 1 m M unlabeled actin 1 0 . 3 m M pyrene - labeled actin ) in the presence of Arp2 / 3 ( 30 n M ) and N - WASP ( 100 n M ) . B , dose response curves showing the activation of N - WASP ( 100 n M ) by increasing concentrations of GST - Nck in the presence or absence of 10 m M PIP 2 vesicles . The maximum polymerization rate , calculated from the linear phase of polymerization curves of the type shown in A , is taken as a measure of N - WASP activity . The curves are non - linear least squares fits of binding isotherms to the data and yield values of K act and P max of 77 n M and 0 . 0048 / s for GST - Nck alone and 81 n M and 0 . 034 / s for GST - Nck plus PIP 2 . F IG . 2 . Nck activates N - WASP more effectively than Grb2 . A , the pyrene actin assay was used to compare the abilities of GST - Grb2 ( 500 n M ) , PIP 2 vesicles ( 10 m M ) , or both together to activate actin polymerization ( 1 m M unlabeled actin 1 0 . 3 m M pyrene - labeled actin ) in the presence of Arp2 / 3 ( 30 n M ) and N - WASP ( 100 n M ) . Activation achieved by 200 n M Nck and 10 m M PIP 2 vesicles is shown for comparison . B , actin polymerization ( at the same actin , Arp2 / 3 , and N - WASP concentrations as in A ) activated by GST - Nck ( 200 n M ) , GST - Grb2 ( 500 m M ) , or both together in the absence of PIP 2 vesicles . Nck Activates N - WASP 26449 a t H opk i n s M a r i n e S t a ti on on S e p t e m b e r 21 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m or - cleaved versions of Nck ( and the Nck mutants described later ) do not significantly differ in activity ( data not shown ) . Because the Grb2 adaptor had been previously reported to stimulate N - WASP - mediated actin polymerization ( 15 ) , we compared the efficacy of Nck and Grb2 in activating N - WASP . GST - Grb2 had only a slight effect on actin polymerization under these conditions , even when present at very high levels ( 500 m M ) , and the combination of GST - Grb2 and PIP 2 - contain - ing vesicles resulted in only a modest further stimulation , significantly lower than that seen with the combination of GST - Nck and PIP 2 ( Fig . 2 A ) . We also tested whether Nck and Grb2 had could synergistically activate N - WASP . As shown in Fig . 2 B , the combination of GST - Nck and GST - Grb2 was actu - ally less effective than GST - Nck alone , consistent with compe - tition between Nck and Grb2 for binding to the same sites on N - WASP . Taken together our results suggest that Nck is a more potent activator of N - WASP than is Grb2 and that their modes of activation are qualitatively similar . Because Cdc42 and SH3 domains likely bind to different sites on the N - WASP molecule , it has been proposed that these two classes of activators may also act synergistically ( 16 ) . In fact , Grb2 and Cdc42 appear to have at least additive effects on the activity of N - WASP ( 15 ) . However , we did not find evidence for synergy between Cdc42 and Nck in the activation of N - WASP ( Fig . 3 ) . In both the presence and absence of PIP 2 vesi - cles , the effects of Nck and Cdc42 together were significantly less than additive , indicating that they are functionally redun - dant . Despite this apparent redundancy , the fact that Cdc42 and Nck bind to different sites on N - WASP indicates that the specific mechanism by which they activate the molecule ( that is , stabilize the active conformation of N - WASP relative to the inactive one ) must be different . In addition , the functional redundancy of Cdc42 and Nck supports the notion that the Nck pathway is an independent signaling mechanism for the con - trol of actin nucleation through the N - WASP - Arp2 / 3 module . This N - WASP - Arp2 / 3 module requires at least two inputs for maximal activation , a property that can allow it to amplify spatially and temporally coincident signals ( 17 ) . In this regard , it will be interesting to examine the effects of SH3 domain F IG . 3 . Nck and Cdc42 have redundant effects on N - WASP activ - ity . The maximum polymerization rate was used to quantitate N - WASP ( 100 n M ) activity in the presence of Arp2 / 3 ( 30 n M ) and the indicated combinations of Cdc42 , Nck , and PIP 2 vesicles ( 10 m M ) . Both the Cdc42 and Nck used in this experiment have been cleaved from GST . F IG . 4 . All three SH3 domains of Nck are required to maximally activate N - WASP .

B , dose - response curves showing the activation of N - WASP ( 100 n M ) by increasing concentrations of various Nck fragments ( defined in A ) in the presence of Arp2 / 3 ( 30 n M ) and PIP 2 vesicles ( 10 m M ) . The curves are non - linear least squares fit of binding isotherms to the data and yield values of K act and P max of 160 n M and 0 . 025 / s for GST - Nck , 100 n M and 0 . 029 / s for GST - SH3 ( 1 1 2 1 3 ) , and 800 n M and 0 . 014 / s for GST - SH3 ( 1 1 2 ) . The data for GST - SH3 ( 2 1 3 ) could not be fit to a simple binding isotherm .

To map the interaction between Nck and N - WASP in more detail , we investigated the abilities of several fragments of Nck to activate N - WASP in the presence of PIP 2 vesicles . The three SH3 domains of Nck are named 1 , 2 , and 3 moving from the N to the C terminus , and the nomenclature of the fragments is summarized in Fig . 4 A . The SH2 domain of Nck is dispensable for the interaction with N - WASP , because GST - Nck displayed approximately the same K act and P max as a C - terminal trunca - tion mutant carrying only the three SH3 domains ( GST - SH3 ( 1 1 2 1 3 ) ) ( Fig . 4 B ) . To identify the specific SH3 domain ( s ) required for activation , we tested protein fragments containing SH3 domains 1 and 2 ( GST - SH3 ( 1 1 2 ) ) , SH3 domains 2 and 3 ( GST - SH3 ( 2 1 3 ) ) , or each individual SH3 domain ( GST - SH3 ( 1 ) , GST - SH3 ( 2 ) , and GST - SH3 ( 3 ) ) . GST - SH3 ( 1 1 2 ) activated N - WASP with an ; 7 - fold higher K act and a 2 - fold lower P max than GST - SH3 ( 1 1 2 1 3 ) ( Fig . 4 B ) . In contrast , GST - SH3 ( 2 1 3 ) did not significantly activate N - WASP until very high concentra - tions ( ; 3 – 10 m M ) were added ( Fig . 4 B ) . None of the SH3 do - mains of Nck were capable of activating N - WASP when tested individually ( Fig . 4 C ) . Based on this domain analysis , optimal activation of N - WASP requires the presence of all three SH3 domains of Nck , consistent with the model in which multiple specific SH3 interactions are required to fix N - WASP in the activated conformation . This is quite distinct from the mode of interaction between Grb2 and N - WASP , where a single C - terminal SH3 domain from Grb2 is sufficient to achieve acti - vation ( 15 ) . To examine the correlation between activation potency and binding affinity , we also mapped the physical interaction be - tween N - WASP and Nck . Using a far - Western assay , several N - WASP truncation mutants ( Fig . 5 A ) were tested for their abilities to bind to the GST - SH3 ( 1 1 2 1 3 ) fragment of Nck , which fully activated N - WASP in the pyrene - actin assay . Full - length N - WASP and the WGP fragment ( containing the WH1 , G - protein - binding , and Poly - proline domains ) bound to Nck , but the two fragments lacking the polyproline region ( WG and VCA ) did not ( Fig . 5 B ) . As expected , the polyproline region of N - WASP is required for the interaction with Nck . Next , the Nck truncation mutants shown in Fig . 4 A were used to identify the SH3 domain ( s ) required for the interaction with N - WASP ( Fig . 5 C ) . The rank order of binding affinities for the Nck fragments is as follows : SH3 ( 1 1 2 1 3 ) $ SH3 ( 2 1 3 ) . SH3 ( 1 1 2 ) . SH3 ( 2 ) . SH3 ( 3 ) . SH3 ( 1 ) ( Fig . 5 C ) . A similar rank order of binding ( SH3 ( 1 1 2 1 3 ) 5 SH3 ( 2 1 3 ) . SH3 ( 1 1 2 ) 5 SH3 ( 2 ) . SH3 ( 3 ) . SH3 ( 1 ) ) was observed when the Nck fragments were tested for their ability to pull down tagged N - WASP from lysates of transfected 293T cells ( Fig . 5 D ) , demonstrating that the far - Western assay accurately re - flects the interaction between the proteins in solution . Based on these results , we conclude that multiple SH3 domains are required for the optimal interaction between Nck and N - WASP , with the second SH3 domain displaying the highest affinity for N - WASP . Although a previous report suggested that the third SH3 domain of Nck binds most tightly to WASP ( 3 ) , we have found that although SH3 – 3 is indeed essential for optimal binding , SH3 – 2 binds more tightly than SH3 – 3 to both N - WASP and WASP ( Fig . 5 , and data not shown ) . A surprising conclusion of our binding and activation data is that the sequence requirements for activation are more strin - gent than those for binding . For instance , although GST - SH3 ( 2 1 3 ) binds quite tightly to N - WASP , it shows almost no ability to activate N - WASP . Instead , GST - SH3 ( 1 1 2 ) , which binds less tightly , can activate N - WASP to a moderate degree , and GST - SH3 ( 1 1 2 1 3 ) , which binds with about equal affinity , can fully activate N - WASP . This suggests that Nck activates N - WASP through multiple cooperative interactions , some of which contribute energy to binding ( SH3 ( 2 1 3 ) ) and others that contribute energy to activation ( SH3 ( 1 1 2 ) ) . It is important to note that the total number of SH3 domains ( independent of identity ) is not the determinant of activity . Wild - type Nck cleaved from GST , with three SH3 domains , can fully activate N - WASP whereas GST - SH3 ( 2 1 3 ) , with four SH3 domains due to the dimerization of GST , cannot activate N - WASP ( Fig . 3 and Fig . 4 B , and data not shown ) . Studies of Vaccinia in tissue culture cells have suggested that Nck recruits N - WASP indirectly to the viral surface through WIP ( 19 ) . Our results show that Nck can also directly interact with N - WASP and dramatically influence its ability to nucleate actin assembly . Thus , recruitment and activation of N - WASP may be controlled by distinct mechanisms , perhaps providing tighter multilevel control over the signaling path - F IG . 5 . Mapping of the interaction between Nck and N - WASP . A , a summary of the nomenclature and amino acid boundaries of the various domains and fragments of N - WASP described in this study . B , far - Western analysis of the interaction between GST - SH3 ( 1 1 2 1 3 ) and various N - WASP fragments . 5 , 0 . 5 , or 0 . 05 pmol of each fragment was fractionated by SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis , transferred to PVDF membrane , and probed with soluble GST - SH3 ( 1 1 2 1 3 ) . C , the interaction of N - WASP or its WGP fragment ( 5 pmol each ) with the indicated Nck SH3 domain fragments was tested using far - Western analysis . Identical membrane strips were incubated individually with different SH3 domain probes before being reassembled for imaging . D , association of N - WASP with Nck SH3 domains in solution . Equal amounts of lysate of 293T cells expressing full - length Myc - tagged N - WASP were incubated with beads bound to GST - Nck constructs as labeled , beads were washed , and bound fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti - Myc antibody to detect N - WASP ( left ) or stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize GST fusion proteins ( right ) . Nck Activates N - WASP 26451 a t H opk i n s M a r i n e S t a ti on on S e p t e m b e r 21 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m way . Consistent with this idea , we have found that the addition of WIP has no effect on the ability of Nck and PIP 2 to activate N - WASP ( data not shown ) . This negative result also shows that WIP ( which has been shown to bind to the second SH3 domain of Nck , as well as the WASP homology domain 1 of WASP and N - WASP ( 4 ) ) does not interfere with the interaction between Nck and N - WASP . Another interesting question is how the interaction between N - WASP and Nck is regulated in cells . The SH3 domains of Nck have been shown to bind to several important signaling proteins that regulate the cytoskeleton , such as p21 - activated kinase , Abl , and Cbl ( 1 , 5 , 20 , 21 ) . These proteins may regulate the Nck - N - WASP interaction by competing with N - WASP for binding to Nck or by the covalent modification of members of an actin nucleation complex containing Nck . In fact , phosphoryl - ation of a conserved tyrosine residue in the regulatory domain of N - WASP has been predicted to stabilize the activated state ( 16 ) . The presence or absence of these other proteins in com - plexes that assemble at the cell surface would modulate whether N - WASP is recruited and activated . The interaction of Nck with tyrosine - phosphorylated receptors would also serve to bring N - WASP into proximity with PIP 2 at the membrane surface . In addition to studies with Vaccinia virus , PIP 2 and phos - photyrosine signals have been implicated in actin assembly stimulated by cytoplasmic vesicles rich in sphingolipid - choles - terol membrane microdomains or “rafts” ( 22 ) . These rafts have been shown to stimulate actin assembly through the WASP - Arp2 / 3 pathway . Our results provide a plausible mechanism by which the phosphotyrosine and PIP 2 signals could be inte - grated by N - WASP through an adapter protein like Nck . Nck has also been implicated in the regulation of membrane ruf - fling downstream of the PDGF - R in NIH 3T3 cells ( 23 ) . Inter - estingly , this pathway is dependent on Rac , which controls ruffling and lamellipodia formation , but not on Cdc42 , which controls filopodia formation ( 24 – 26 ) . Thus , the Nck pathway may serve as a general Cdc42 - independent link between phos - photyrosine signals and the actin cytoskeleton .
