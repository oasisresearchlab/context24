It is well known that chemical stimuli direct macrophage behavior ; however , the contributions of viscosity that are found to increase in inflammatory tissues but not in tumors are ignored in related immune responses including effective activation and timely attenuation . Herein , we show that transient lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) - treated macrophages benefit from elastic substrates , while viscoelastic substrates with similar storage modulus support the inflammatory responses of macrophages under persistent stimulations and consequently amplify the distinctions between the transient and persistent LPS - induced transcriptional programs . Actin filaments ( F - actin ) , direct responders to mechanical stimulations , fluctuate in line with transcriptional profiles and can be mathematically predicted by a clutch - like model . Moreover , F - actin levels dictate immune responses through transcription factors NF - κB and C / EBPδ , which act as switches discriminating between the transient and persistent infections . Interestingly , enhanced immune responses , as controlled as the lower activated macrophages , are attenuated timely by the actin nucleation - related translocation of ATF3 to nuclei . These findings suggest that substrate viscoelasticity induces more intense inflammation only in the case of persistent infection and serves as a key module for perceiving the duration of infection more sensitively through the F - actin correlated transcription factors . In addition , it may facilitate cognition to immune response in inflammatory and cancerous microenvironments and have a wide range of applications in inflammatory regulations . Keywords : Viscoelastic matrix ; Duration of LPS infection ; Macrophages ; Inflammatory response 1 . Introduction Macrophages categorized as the first innate immune cells maintain the stability of the immune microenvironment by promoting , attenuating inflammation and initiating repair process in a case of disturbances such as microbial infections and implantation . To realize multilevel functions in fluctuating microenvironments , macrophages precisely discriminate the patterns , intensities , and durations of signals and respond appropriately with distinct but continuous states varying from the pro - inflammatory ( M1 ) to pro - healing ( M2 ) ones [ 1 ] . Both the intensity and dynamics of inflammatory responses are mainly determined by soluble biochemical factors and show recently to be regulated by physical stimulators and passive physical parameters including the mechanical properties , architecture , and topography of the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) [ 2 ] . By studying the effects of matrix mechanical properties on macrophages , it has been found that the stiffness of biomaterials strongly influences the functions and mobility of macrophages under various biochemical conditions [ 3 - 5 ] ; however , it is not clear whether or how the viscoelasticity of materials with physiological compliance impacts the immune responses under transient and persistent lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) stimulations as compared with those of pure elastic materials with the same static stiffness . The normal tissue niches with macrophages possess relatively stable mechanical properties , which maintain a secure immune environment to protect human beings from numerous diseases . In general , inflammatory tissues and benign tumors exhibit relatively high viscosity manifesting as larger loss storage modulus ( G ' ' ) , stronger strain hysteresis , longer relaxation time and / or high strain retardation time , while malignant tumors appear to be purely elastic , although both of them show increased stiffness compared to normal tissues [ 6 - 8 ] . These pathological changes in the viscosity of tissues observed during inflammation or cancerization , even more than the alterations in elastic modulus , suggest a 3 strong influence of tissue viscoelasticity on the disease course . Hence , it is essential to explore the effect of ECM viscoelasticity on the macrophage behavior in the presence of cytokines with various duration . The studies on the influence of viscoelasticity on cell properties conducted during the last several decades originally focused on cell spreading [ 9 , 10 ] and then gradually shifted to cellular functions and collective behaviors [ 11 - 15 ] . This motivated us to examine the consequent changes in macrophage activities modified by the viscoelastic properties of ECMs . Monocyte - derived macrophages or resident macrophages continuously pass through intricate and time - dependent microenvironments in native niches . They prudently discriminate and flexibly respond to various stimulators to protect tissue homeostasis and initiate the subsequent immune reactions through the enhanced expression of pro - inflammatory cytokines , chemokines , and costimulatory receptors [ 16 ] . Bacterial LPS , one of the common irritants detected by TLR4 on macrophages , generate precisely controlled pro - inflammatory responses depending on the stimulus density [ 17 ] and duration [ 18 ] , and previous conditions [ 19 ] . For example , C / EBPδ involved in determining the duration of infection demonstrates one of the mechanism by which macrophages are highly sensitive to biochemical signals [ 18 ] . In addition to biochemical clues , macrophages encounter inherently multifarious physical clues . It has been reported previously that physical settings regulate the phase and intensity of immune processes indirectly through various patterns of activated integrins [ 20 , 21 ] . Strikingly , substrate stiffness , spatial confinement , and other physical properties can directly affect the phagocytosis , migration , and functions of macrophages / monocytes [ 3 , 22 , 23 ] under a pro - inflammatory activation dictated by actin polymerization , which is associated with Yes - associated protein ( YAP ) and the immune - related transcription factor [ 24 ] . However , the majority of studies on the influence of physical factors ignored the ability of macrophages to discriminate the duration of infection . Therefore , it would be important to investigate such ability on various substrates . Taken together , transient / persistent LPS treated - macrophages on elastic / viscoelastic substrates were considered . In this work , we prepared two different types of substrates : elastic ones to mimic malignant tumor tissues ( used as control ) and viscoelastic substrates with a storage modulus equal to that of elastic gels , representing inflamed tissues . Transient infection was performed as one - hour LPS treatment and then kept in normal culture media until macrophages under persistent infection ( ≥4h ) was ready . We directly compared the cells seeded on the elastic ( ECs ) and viscoelastic ( VCs ) substrates under transient or persistent infection and their abilities to discriminate transient and persistent infections indirectly by setting ECs as controls . The objective of this study was to investigate the role of substrate viscosity in modulating the activities of transient and persistent LPS - treated macrophages and elucidate the underlying mechanism . First , we demonstrated the role of substrate viscosity on the expression levels of transcriptional programs in macrophages under transient and persistent LPS stimulations . After that , we quantified the total levels of F - actin under the combined action of viscosity and LPS and verified its role by pharmacological repression . Finally , we analyzed the alterations in nuclear levels of transcriptional factors involved in discriminating the duration of infection . The obtained results revealed that ECs were more active than VCs under transient infections ; however , the inflammatory responses of ECs were inferior to those of VCs under the persistent LPS simulations , which implied that VCs discriminated the duration of infection more effectively . The total F - actin and pharmacological repression confirmed the action of F - actin polymerization , which could be predicted by a clutch - like model . Furthermore , the verified transcription factors involved in discriminating the duration of infection were strongly affected by substrate viscosity . Interestingly , the attenuator ATF3 related to F - actin nucleation , exhibited the tendency demonstrated by the positive transcription factors , which ensured timely attenuation of the promoted inflammation . The amplifier C / EBPδ 4 dominated this regulation and was dictated by F - actin polymerization . In summary , we demonstrate that by varying the viscosity of substrates , it is possible to modulate the inflammatory responses of macrophages differently between transient and persistent LPS simulations due to the F - actin polymerization - related transcription factors . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first study that examines the opposite effects of matrix viscosity on macrophages under different durations of infection . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Preparation of viscoelastic polyacrylamide gels and fibronectin coatings Polyacrylamide ( PA ) gels were prepared on hydrophilic glass coverslips following the protocol described by Tse and Engler [ 25 ] . Briefly , elastic gels were produced from 8 % ( wt . / vol . ) acrylamide and 0 . 2 % ( wt . / vol . ) bis - acrylamide solutions polymerized in the presence of N , N , N′ , N′ - tetramethylethylenediamine and ammonium persulfate . The viscosity of the gels was varied by adding 6 % ( wt . / vol . ) acrylamide solution , which was previously degassed , polymerized , and wrapped into acrylamide and bis - acrylamide networks [ 10 ] . The solid gels attached to coverslips were immersed in phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) for equilibrium swelling and then sterilized with germicidal ultraviolet ( UV ) light . To obtain fibronectin ( FN , Corning ) coatings , the PA gels immersed into 0 . 1 mg / mL sulfosuccinimidyl 6 - ( 4 - azido - 2 - nitrophenylamino ) hexanoate ( Sulfo - SANPAH , Sigma Aldrich ) in Hepes ( 50 mM , pH = 8 . 2 ) were exposed to longwave UV light for 30 min , washed , and incubated with 25 μg / mL FN / Dulbecco’s PBS ( DPBS ) solution overnight at 4 °C . Afterwards , the gels were rinsed 2 times with DPBS to remove soluble FN residues . The initial condition disturbance , including endotoxin contamination , was verified by conducting gene expression analysis after cell seeding . 2 . 2 . Gel rheology and FN absorption Mechanical properties of the PA gels were evaluated using a DHR rheometer consisting of an 8 - mm circular parallel plate . The stress relaxation and frequency dependence of the gels were measured under a 10 % strain for 100 s and under a 2 % strain at frequencies between 0 . 1 and 10 rad / s . The total amount and density of the adhered FN were determined by fluorescent staining and remainder FN tests . Briefly , we blocked the samples in 2 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) solution at 25 °C for 1 h and incubated with human FN antibodies ( R & D Systems ) overnight at 4 °C . After that , the samples were washed twice with PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies at 25 °C for 1 h . The remaining FN species were analyzed by a protein quantification kit ( Beyotime Biotechnology ) after absorption , and their absorbance at 562 nm was measured with a microplate reader . 2 . 3 . Cell culture and drug treatment Raw 264 . 7 cells were donated by the Chen Wei group at Zhejiang University . They were expanded in Dulbecco ' s modified eagle medium ( D6429 , Corning ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Gibco ) and 1 % penicillin - streptomycin solution ( Gibco ) at 37 °C . Cells were subcultured without trypsin to prevent differentiation and then checked for cellular shapes before the experiment . For TLR4 stimulation , 100 ng / mL LPS solution ( Invitrogen ) was applied to macrophages for 1 h in transient infection or for over 4 h in persistent induction . Latrunculin - A ( Lat - A , Abcam ) [ 26 ] , a toxin binding to G - actin , was applied to inhibit F - actin polymerization . Macrophages were treated with 0 . 2 μM Lat - A for 120 min before LPS addition , and Lat - A was kept in the medium during the persistent activation or added back to normal culture media during the transient activation . 2 . 4 . Real - time polymerase chain reaction for gene expression 5 We isolated RNA from the gels with a Tiangen RNA isolation kit following manufacturer’s instructions . The RNA collected from cells under the opposite conditions was extracted simultaneously for contrast . A NanoDrop spectrophotometer was utilized for both qualitative and quantitative RNA analyses . DNAase and reverse transcriptase ( RT ) enzymes were used to purify and transcribe cDNA with a fast all - in - one RT kit ( ES Science , China ) . Briefly , genomic DNA was removed by DNase at 25 °C for 5 min , and RNA was transcribed to cDNA at 42 °C for 15 min . A quantitative real - time polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) was performed using a SYBR Green qPCR master mix ( Yeasen , China ) on a Stepone RT - PCR system . Representative M1 early and late genes were assessed using several primer sequences ( Supplementary Table 1 ) , and GAPDH was chosen as the housekeeping gene . Relative mRNA expression was calculated with the ΔΔCt method to compare gene expression levels under various conditions . 2 . 5 . Heatmaps of relative gene expression levels The mean values of the gene expressions of ECs or VCs under the transient and persistent LPS stimulations were obtained from the results of three independent experiments . The EC gene expressions were set to 1 regardless of the infection type to quantify the distinctions between VCs and ECs . Consequently , the difference of ECs between the transient and persistent infections was set to zero . Performances of VCs with transient / persistent irritation were presented relatively to ECs , respectively . Corresponding differences of VCs between transient and persistent stimulations depicted expanding ability of VCs to discriminate the durations of infection . The protein analysis data observed between ECs and VCs ( regardless of the infection type ) was compared directly , but the gaps between transient and persistent infections could be only compared indirectly . These were in the same situation as gene expression . 2 . 6 . Immunostaining Macrophages on the prepared PA gels were rinsed twice with PBS and fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde solution for 15 min . Cell membranes were permeabilized with 0 . 3 % Triton X - 100 solution in PBS for 10 min , following with PBS washing for three times . Samples were then immersed in 5 % BSA solution for 60 min , blocked , and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 2 % BSA solution at 4 °C overnight . Primary antibodies against NF - κB ( 1 : 50 ; c - Rel , Santa Cruz ) , C / EBPδ ( 1 : 50 ; C - 6 , Santa Cruz ) , and ATF3 ( 1 : 50 ; A - 8 , Santa Cruz ) were used for staining . After washing twice with 2 % BSA solution , the samples were incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies diluted in 2 % BSA solution for 1 h at RT and then subjected to nuclear staining with 4 , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI , Invitrogen ) for 15 min . The samples were treated with phalloidin - TRITC ( Yeason , China ) for 30 min to label F - actin . 2 . 7 . Confocal imaging and analysis Macrophage images were obtained using Nikon C2 + and Ti2 - E confocal microscopes . To determine F - actin levels and cell spreading areas , a ×40 ( 1 . 4 NA ) oil objective was applied for slice capturing with a z - step of 0 . 80 μm . The maximal intensity and total intensity were selected to merge the z - step stacks for the cell area and F - actin level quantification , respectively . Fig . S4 shows the detailed slice - by - slice images of F - actin in ECs and VCs without / with persistent LPS stimulations for quantifying the total F - actin levels . To estimate the levels of transcription factors in the nuclei , fluorescence images were captured by a Nikon Ti2 - E microscope with a z - step of 0 . 6 μm and pinhole size of 1 . 2 a . u . Fig . S6 shows the detailed slice - by - slice ( z - step : 0 . 6 μm ) images of transient LPS - treated ECs and VCs stained with C / EBPδ and DAPI . MATLAB 2017b ( MathWorks ) software was used to demarcate nuclear contours and extract the nuclear parts of transcription factors from the 6 corresponding binarized nuclei images . The total levels of transcription factors in the nuclei were quantified by ImageJ software ( NIH ) from the total intensity of Z - stacks . 2 . 8 . Stochastic modeling of the traction force and F - actin polymerization We adapted a classical molecular clutch model [ 27 - 29 ] to simulate the effects of substrate viscosity on the force transmission and F - actin polymerization . The comprehensive model included two flexible connections and a constant force : ( 1 ) integrin - substrate catch bonds determined by the binding and dissociation rates ; ( 2 ) F - actin catch – slip bond to illustrate the forced F - actin polymerization resulting from the integrin - cytoskeleton tension ; and ( 3 ) myosin motor activity producing a constant contraction without pharmacological disorder . The phosphorylated levels of the myosin light chains were proved to be unaffected by LPS [ 30 ] ; therefore , we set a fixed number of myosin motors pulling on actin with a constant force . The connections between F - actin and substrates mainly depended on the integrins forming a “clutch” and various protein complexes reinforcing the joint . LPS was confirmed to promote “clutch” binding rate by increased integrins and extend reinforcement range by extra connecting proteins [ 31 - 35 ] . Notably , we also selected parameters representing zero - force dissociation rates as recommended previously . First , we studied the clutch dynamics of the integrin - substrate connection . The unit engagement probability or the fraction of clutches engaged in actin bundles can be expressed as , [ 1 ] ⅆ𝑃 𝑏 , 𝑖 ⅆ𝑡 = 𝑟 𝑜𝑛 ( 1 ‒ 𝑃 𝑏 , 𝑖 ) ‒ 𝑟 𝑜𝑓𝑓 ∗ exp ( 𝐹 𝑐 , 𝑖 𝐹 ∗ⅈ𝑛𝑡 ‒ 𝜙 𝑖𝑛𝑡 ) 𝑃 𝑏 , 𝑖 where may reinforced as when the average traction force surpasses 𝑟 𝑜𝑛 𝑟 𝑜𝑛 ( 1 + 𝛼 ( 𝐹 𝑎 ‒ 𝐹 𝑒𝑛 ‒ 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒 ) ) 𝐹 𝑎 the reinforcement threshold . In addition , and may assume different values 𝐹 𝑒𝑛 ‒ 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒 𝑟 𝑜𝑛 𝐹 𝑒𝑛 ‒ 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒 under different durations of infection . The traction force was associated with the substrate stiffness and ECs had certain traction force in certain LPS condition . Whereas , VCs experienced stiffness gradient may have non - monotonic traction force due to clutch - reinforcement ( Fig . S5 ) . The traction force , which was essential for the final simulation of actin polymerization , was calculated by the formula . A bunch of clutches was simplified as a combination of 𝐹 𝑠 = 𝐹 𝑎 𝑃 𝑏 , 𝑖 𝑁 𝑐 = 𝑘 𝑐 ∑ 𝑁 𝑐 𝑖 = 1 ( 𝑥 𝑐 , 𝑖 ‒ 𝑥 𝑠 ) linear elastic springs with elastic modulus . One end of each spring was connected to the 𝑘 𝑐 elastic / viscoelastic substrate , and the other end was attached to the actin bundle . The force balance at the spring end connected to the substrate can be written as follows : for the elastic substrate [ 2 ] - 1 k l x s = F s for the viscoelastic substrate [ 2 ] - 2 ( k a + k l ) η ⅆ x s ⅆt + k a k l x s = k a F s + η ⅆFs ⅆt At the other end , a competition between the pulling forces of the myosin motors and clutches along the actin bundle can be described by Hill’s relation [ 27 ] : [ 3 ] ν f = ν u ( 1 ‒ F s N m F m ) Once we defined the retrograde flow speed of F - actin , the displacement of clutch at actin end was expressed as [ 4 ] ⅆ x c , i ⅆt = P b , i ν f + ( 1 ‒ P b , i ) ⅆ x s dt Using these equations , we determined the correlation between the traction force and the substrate 7 stiffness under various LPS durations , as described in Figs . S5A , B , and C . In this model , the traction force not only determines the actin retrograde flow speed but is also involved in the F - actin catch - slip bond as follows [ 29 ] : [ 5 ] 𝑑𝑁 𝑎𝑐𝑡 𝑑𝑡 = 𝛾 𝑎𝑐𝑡 ( 𝑁 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑐𝑡 ‒ 𝑁 𝑎𝑐𝑡 ) ‒ 𝑁 𝑎𝑐𝑡 [ 𝑒𝑥𝑝 ( F s 𝐹 ∗ 𝑎𝑐𝑡 ∙ 𝑁𝑎𝑐𝑡 ∙ Pb , i ‒ 𝜙 𝑎𝑐𝑡 , 𝑠 ) + 𝑒𝑥𝑝 ( ‒ F s 𝐹 ∗ 𝑎𝑐𝑡 ∙ 𝑁𝑎𝑐𝑡 ∙ Pb , i + 𝜙 𝑎𝑐𝑡 , 𝑐 ) ] According to the obtained values , the initial amount of mono - actin assembled in F - actin 𝑓 ∗𝑎𝑐𝑡 , and zero - force dissociation rates and , the number of mono - actins engaged in 𝑁 𝑎𝑐𝑡 _ 𝑡𝑜𝑡 𝜙 𝑎𝑐𝑡 , 𝑠 𝜙 𝑎𝑐𝑡 , 𝑐 the actin bundle was positively correlated with the traction force within reasonable range ( Fig . S5D ) . Their definitions and values are provided in Supplementary Table 2 . 2 . 9 . Euler - like number analysis The Euler - like number is defined as , where is the parameter E ( 8 ) ‒ 𝑉 + 2𝐹 𝐸 ( 8 ) = 𝑉 ‒ 𝐸 ‒ 𝐷 + 𝑇 ‒ 𝐹 used to determine the number of singly connected domains . V represents the total number of non - zero pixels ; E is the number of and components ; D is the number of an components ; T is the number of , , , and components ; and F is the number of components . Here , is one pixel with value 1 in the binary graph , and E , D , T , and F are the certain forms of connections . We assumed that the connection forms of E and D corresponded to elongation of F - actin , and T and F represented nucleation . 2 . 10 . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 24 ( SPSS , Inc . ) software , and the obtained results were visualized by Origin 2021 ( OriginLab , Inc . ) . Macrophage data were presented as boxplots with points and compared by conducting a two - tailed independent Student’s t - test for two groups and more than 50 cells were analyzed . A normality analysis procedure included performing a Shapiro – Wilk test before comparisons . The properties of the studied gels were presented as bar charts with mean ± stdev values obtained from the results of three independent experiments . Statistically significant differences were accepted as p < 0 . 05 . ( ns ( not significant ) , * ( p ≤ 0 . 05 ) , * * ( p ≤ 0 . 01 ) , * * * ( p ≤ 0 . 001 ) , and * * * * ( p ≤ 0 . 0001 ) ) . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Effects of viscoelastic substrates without biochemical factors Macrophages were cultured on the fibronectin - coated PA hydrogels , which were widely used as extracellular substrates in two - dimensional cell studies [ 36 ] . Considering the viscoelasticity changes of the native tissues observed during inflammation and canceration [ 6 - 8 ] , we prepared two different types of gels with the same shear storage modulus : one for imitating the inflamed tissues with a 𝐺 ' high level of loss modulus and the other one representing cancer tissues . Here , we applied 𝐺 " Charrier’s method [ 10 ] to achieve the viscoelasticity of solid hydrogels and the gel stiffness were both about 3 kPa corresponding to the elastic modulus of the pancreas or breast tissues [ 6 , 8 ] . During the stress relaxation tests conducted at a 10 % strain , the elastic gels reached a steady state without hesitation , and the viscoelastic matrix relaxed to a plateau with a delay of approximately 5 s ( Fig . 1A ) . We verified the mechanical properties of these gels by frequency sweeping ; it was found that both the elastic modulus and loss modulus only slightly depended on strain in the sweep 𝐺 ' 𝐺 " 8 frequency range from 0 . 1 to 10 rad / s ( Figs . 1A ( insert ) and S1A ) . By taking into account the rates of cellular processes involved in mechano - sensing ( i . e . , ~ 10 s for fluctuating FAs ( lamellipodium ) [ 37 ] and filopodia [ 27 ] ) , we measured the values of and at a frequency of 0 . 63 rad / s （ ≈ 0 . 1 Hz ） 𝐺 ' 𝐺 " ( Fig . 1B ) . We also maintained the concentration and volume of the linker Sulfo - SANPAH and FN to prevent the distinctions in local stress probing , which depended on the number of adhesion elements for one cellular adhesion site [ 38 , 39 ] . The amount of FN covalently anchored to the PA gels was A B C D Fig . 1 .

G’ is denoted by the gray bars ( left ) , and the G” magnitudes are depicted by the red bars for the elastic and viscoelastic gels . The Eerror bars represent the standard errors ( B ) . Macrophages exhibit higher levels of F - actin and larger sizes on the viscoelastic substrates without LPS stimulation ( C ) , as indicated by the box - and - whisker plots with the scattered points ( the middle horizontal lines denote the median values , and the whiskers indicate the standard deviations ( s . d . ) ) . However , the correlations between the F - actin levels and the cell spreading areas were barely affected by the mechanical properties of the gels ( D ) . r : Pearson’s correlation coefficient . 9 determined by immunofluorescence ( Fig . S1B ) and BCA protein assay kit ( Fig . S1B ) . To explore the effect of viscoelasticity on immune responses , macrophages were seeded on the PA gels with different viscosities , while the storage elastic modulus and FN density remained constant . 𝐺 ' We first assessed the F - actin levels and morphology of macrophages on both types of substrates without LPS . We found that VCs spread slightly more than ECs ( Fig . 1C ) . The measured F - actin levels were in compliance with the spreading areas ( Fig . 1C ) , and their correlation was not affected by the substrate viscosity ( Fig . 1D ) . Afterwards , we utilized transcriptional programs to confirm a low irritation ( of IL - 6 ) before dosing and set it as the base value ( Fig . S2A ) . IL - 6 and IL - 1β 10 ‒ 6 expressions were preliminarily enhanced by viscoelasticity ( Fig . S2A ) . 3 . 2 . Immune responses of ECs and VCs under transient and persistent LPS stimulations Transient and persistent TLR4 - induced signals activated by LPS for 1 h and over 4 h [ 18 ] were marked by the following M1 - related genes tested at transcriptional level : the early response genes TNF - α ( tumor necrosis factor ) and CXCL2 , and the late genes IL - 6 ( interleukin 6 ) and IL - 1β ( interleukin 1 beta ) , respectively [ 30 ] . Notably , IL - 6 was connected to stimulate T - cells and B - cells favoring chronic inflammatory responses [ 40 ] and severe consequences of virus infection [ 41 ] , while IL - 1β contributed to both the pro - inflammatory and anti - inflammatory responses . TNF - α and CXCL2 related primary responsive genes were tested 2 h after the first treatment . For transient infection ( 1 h LPS and 1 h culture media ) , TNF - α and CXCL2 were barely affected , but IL - 6 checked at the same time were suppressed by substrate viscosity ( Fig . 2A ) . In contrast , both early and late responsive genes were promoted by substrate viscosity under persistent infection . In particular , the late genes IL - 6 and IL - 1β were significantly influenced by viscosity ( Fig . 2A ) , although they had not yet bounced at 2 h . Considering the late responsive genes peaked at 4 / 6 h , transient LPS treatment benefited the transcriptional programs of ECs over VCs ( Fig . 2B ) ( 3 / 5 h after the LPS removal ) . Whereas , the expression of IL - 6 and IL - 1β on VCs were upregulated under persistent infection , as compared to ECs ( Fig . 2B ) . And the differences were maintained for 24 h after LPS stimulation ( Fig . S2A ) . IL - 6 and IL - 1β genes were fully activated after the LPS treatment for 4 – 6 hours ( Fig . S2A ) . Consistent with the results of previous studies on plastic materials [ 18 ] , the transiently activated M1 - related genes were weaker than those after persistent treatment regardless of ECs or VCs ( Fig . S2B ) . For presentation , the transcriptional programs of ECs were set as control respectively in both transient and persistent infection . Consequently , transcriptional levels of VCs treated with transient / persistent LPS presented as relative to ECs . Observed differences between transient and persistent LPS - treated LPS suggest that viscoelastic substrates amplify the discrimination between the transient and persistent irritations by suppressing the transient activation and promoting the persistent activation ( as compared with the processes occurring on the elastic substrates ) . 3 . 3 . Viscosity regulates actin polymerization affected by various durations of infection F - actin , one of the main components of cytoskeleton , is considered as direct mechanical transducer in many studies on the mechanical factors affecting cellular functions [ 39 , 42 , 43 ] . It has been reported previously [ 30 ] and confirmed in this study that LPS stimulation increases the F - actin levels and cell areas of macrophages on various substrates ( Figs . S3A and B ) . This robust growth due to LPS treatment and distinctions of F - actin levels and cell areas between ECs and VCs without stimulation ( Figs . 1C , S3A and B ) reminded us the critical role of F - actin or cell area in immune responses ( Fig . 2C ) . Significantly higher F - actin levels were observed in the persistent LPS - treated VCs as compared with those in ECs ; however , total F - actin levels of ECs benefited from transient activation ( Figs . 2D , S3C and D ) . On the contrary , the differences in spreading areas between the 10 persistent LPS - treated ECs and VCs were not all statistically significant ( Figs . S3C , D and E ) , and the former were impeded under transient activation ( Fig . S3E ) . The performance of F - actin was in accordance with the expression of M1 - related genes ( Figs . 2B ) , which implied the participation of F - actin in viscoelasticity - regulated inflammatory process . As this suggested a possible involvement of actin polymerization in substrate viscosity & duration of the infection directed M1 activation , we hindered F - actin polymerization pharmacologically by Lat - A . After that , we quantified the expression of late responsive genes and actin levels of the transient - activated ECs and persistent - activated A B C D Fig . 2 . Viscosity regulates the immune responses dictated by the duration of infection with the help of F - actin The color - coded arrays denote the expression levels obtained at 2 , 4 , and 6 h after LPS stimulation . For transient infection , cells were shifted to normal culture media for 1 , 3 , and 5 hours . The transcriptional programs of ECs under both transient and persistent LPS stimulations were normalized as controls . The relative transcriptional levels on the viscoelastic substrates obtained after certain infection durations are compared with those on the elastic substrates in panels ( A ) and ( B ) , respectively . The suppressed immune responses of the transient LPS - treated VCs and promoted responses of the persistent LPS - treated VCs indicate that substrate viscosity amplifies the discrimination between the transient and persistent TLR4 signals ( A ) and ( B ) . Early responsive genes TNF - α and CXCL2 demonstrated little distinction at 2 h , while the late gene IL - 6 showed notable changes caused by viscosity ( A ) . Late responsive genes obtained at 4 h and 6 h presented significant differences between ECs and VCs under transient / persistent infection ( B ) .

The cells were stitched together under the same conditions . Scale bar : 10 μm . The brightness of the pictures is not directly related to the fluorescence intensity . The box plots with scattered points represent the total F - actin levels in the transient and persistent LPS - treated macrophages and the viscosity effects observed at different durations of infection ( the data are normalized with respect to the F - actin levels of ECs ) ( D ) . These results show that the total F - actin levels ( D ) and transcriptional levels ( A ) are synchronously affected by viscosity . Note that VCs exhibited lower F - actin levels under transient LPS treatment , but significantly higher F - actin levels after persistent LPS treatment . More than 50 cells were analyzed at each condition ; the significance of the obtained data was assessed by conducting two - tailed Student’s t - tests ( * ( p ≤ 0 . 05 ) , * * ( p ≤ 0 . 01 ) , * * * * ( p ≤ 0 . 0001 ) ) . A B C D Fig . 3 . Actin polymerization involving in the effects of substrate viscosity on the immune responses predicted by the clutch - like model The color - coded arrays denote the transcriptional programs of the Lat - A + transient LPS - treated ECs and Lat - A + persistent LPS - treated VCs compared with those without Lat - A ( A ) , which indicate the participation of actin polymerization in the viscosity - dictated immune responses under transient / persistent LPS stimulations . The box plots and representative images confirm the effect of Lat - A ( B ) . More than 50 cells were analyzed under each condition . The relaxation spectrum of the viscoelastic gels was obtained from discrete data through a regularized inverse Laplace transform ( C ) . The relaxation timescale captured in the spectrum fits the experimental data using the Maxwell model ( insert ) . τ = 0 . 12 s was selected as the relaxation time for the clutch - like model . The F - actin levels of ECs and VCs under different durations of LPS infection were simulated by the clutch - like model and presented as the VC - to - EC ratios . The LPS - related parameters vary synchronously with infection duration and the corresponding ratio of VCs / ECs F - actin level under none / transient / persistent LPS treatment are denoted by the pentagrams ( D ) . ( Refer to Supporting Information 12 for more details ) VCs with / without Lat - A . As expected , the transcriptional programs ( Fig . 3A ) and actin levels ( Fig . 3B ) adjusted by the mechanical characteristics of ECM , were attenuated in the Lat - A - inhibited cells . This confirmed that the viscoelastic substrates promoted responses to persistent stimulation and that the elastic substrates facilitated the reaction to the transient stimulation due to F - actin polymerization . Interestingly , VCs appeared to be larger and thicker than ECs after persistent LPS stimulation , which indicate more activated states connected to larger volume [ 44 ] ( Fig . S4 ) . Whereas , the volume of ECs and VCs without LPS stimulation did not show difference . Combined with the F - actin levels of ECs and VCs without LPS ( Fig . 1C ) , the biomechanical factors and duration of infection considerably affected the expressions of mechanotransduction - related genes . 3 . 4 . Clutch model predicts F - actin polymerizations of ECs and VCs under different durations of infection Molecular clutch models have been established previously to predict the biphasic or monotonic dependence of F - actins , cell areas and migration on various mechanical properties of the ECM [ 28 , 45 - 47 ] . Herein , we examined the differences between the F - actins of ECs and VCs and modeled the fluctuations of the VCs - actins / ECs - actins ratio without a stimulation and under the transient and persistent stimulations . The resulting model combined three cellular processes : integrin kinetics , in charge of the interactions between F - actin and the viscoelastic substrates ; formation of F - actin catch – slip bonds affecting the actin polymerization rate ; and myosin motors applying force on F - actin toward the cell center [ 28 , 29 ] . When describing the substrate mechanical properties ( especially viscoelasticity ) , a regularized inverse Laplace transform based on the Maxwell model was used to obtain relaxation timescales ( Fig . 3C ) . Owing to the large proportion of τ = 0 . 12 s in the relaxation spectrum , we utilized this parameter in the developed clutch - like model ( see Supplementary Information for more details ) . The interactions between F - actins and the substrates can be further strengthened after LPS treatment by vinculin and paxillin in the transduction of the transcellular force [ 48 - 50 ] , resulting in a continuous decrease in the integrin - matrix clutch enhancement related parameter ‘ ’ . F - actin polymerization was simulated by the catch - slip dynamics of G - actins 𝐹 𝑒𝑛 ‒ 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒 [ 51 ] and cellular machineries such as formin , profilin , and zyxin were consider to support actin polymerization under loading [ 52 - 54 ] characterized by the parameters ‘ ’ and ‘ ’ involved in 𝜙 𝑎𝑐𝑡 , 𝑠 𝜙 𝑎𝑐𝑡 , 𝑐 . Of note , monotonically decreases with the clutch force within a reasonable range 𝑘 𝑎𝑐𝑡 , 𝑜𝑓𝑓 𝑘 𝑎𝑐𝑡 , 𝑜𝑓𝑓 with certain parameters ‘ ’ and ‘ ’ ( Fig . S5D ) . In this model , LPS - related increases in integrin 𝜙 𝑎𝑐𝑡 , 𝑠 𝜙 𝑎𝑐𝑡 , 𝑐 were simplified as increase in basal association rate ( ) , which affected the relationship between r on0 substrate stiffness and cellular traction force [ 31 , 32 ] ; increased participation of vinculin or formin after LPS affected by the prerequisite of the catch - bond reinforcement ( ) , which altered r on 𝐹 𝑒𝑛 ‒ 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒 the relationship mainly on stiffer substrate . In general , viscoelastic gels change their stiffness under stress , and gradually more part of stiffness range experienced by VCs involved in reinforcement during LPS treatment ( Figs . S5A - C ) . It has been noticed previously that the phosphorylated myosin light chain related to the myosin motor activity was not impacted by infection [ 30 ] , and that the force 13 produced by the myosin motors was kept constant in this clutch model . The developed theoretical model predicted that the F - actin levels of VCs without LPS exceeded those of ECs ; this trend was reversed under the transient LPS stimulation and returned to the higher levels under the persistent LPS stimulation ( Fig . 3D ) . The colors of the heatmap represent VC / EC ratios of F - actin levels changing with the critical parameters and reflected the influences of the substrate r on0 𝐹 𝑒𝑛 ‒ 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒 viscoelasticity and infection duration in the utilized model . The observed differences in the actin polymerization dynamics could also result from the differences between the dynamic properties of various integrins that altered with LPS treatment [ 33 - 35 ] ; however , they were essentially the same for the modeling purposes . 3 . 5 . Variations of F - actin characteristics The architecture of F - actin in macrophages was not sufficiently clear for the analysis of actin bundles , especially in the absence of stimulation . Hence , we attempted to capture the features of F - actin in transient / persistent LPS - treated ECs and VCs indirectly . First , we focused on the F - actin density , A - 1 A - 2 B C Fig . 4 . Cell morphology and F - actin characteristics Experimentally determined F - actin levels and cell spreading areas are shown as the linearly fitted scatter plots . F - actin of transient LPS - treated ECs are slightly denser than VCs ( A - 1 ) , while density of F - actin levels of persistent LPS - treated VCs were higher than ECs denoted by the larger slope ( A - 2 ) . r : Pearson’s correlation coefficient . Solidity calculated by ImageJ software is represented by the three - dimensional bar plot ( B ) . The significantly lower indexes of the persistent LPS - treated macrophages imply the existence of filopodia , and the representative pictures ( Fig . 2C ) confirm these slender actin features . The analysis of the Euler - like numbers revealed that F - actin of the persistent ( 4 h ) LPS - treated VCs showed more indexes 14 directed to elongation ( C , left ) , while the F - actin species of the persistent ( 6 h ) LPS - treated VCs tended to nucleate more than ECs ( C , right ) . Only single cells were counted for the analyses of spreading areas , cell morphologies , and F - actin structures . and the ratios of F - actin levels to cell areas were determined from the slopes of linear fitting curves for the experimental data . We found that the slopes of VCs were slightly lower than those of ECs under the transient activation ( Fig . 4A - 1 ) , and VCs exhibited noticeably higher slopes than those of ECs after the persistent irritation ( Fig . 4A - 2 ) . In addition , LPS - treated macrophages on certain gel also contained condensed F - actin in contrast to the control groups without LPS ( Supplementary Table 2 ) . Interestingly , the height of macrophages also synchronously altered with immune responses affected by substrate viscosity : transient LPS - treated ECs and persistent LPS - treated VCs were thicker ( Fig . S4C and D ) . Owing to the apparent morphological changes of the persistent ( 4 h ) LPS - treated cells ( Fig . 2C ) , we statistically analyzed the solidity of concave polygon cells ( defined as the area / convex area ) , not circularity or roundness , to examine F - actin extensions . Consistent with the intuitive observations of filopodia , there was no significant index directed to apparent filopodia in ECs and VCs without / with A B Fig . 5 . F - actin related proteins that discriminate between transient and persistent TLR4 signals The color - coded representative images of ECs and VCs infected with transient / persistent ( 4 h ) LPS were stained for NF - κB , C / EBPδ , and ATF - 3 ( A ) . 15 The color bar indicates the pixel intensity values . The nuclear edges are determined in Matlab and marked by the white lines . Scale bar : 10 μm . The color - coded arrays and box plots depict the nuclear levels of proteins calculated by ImageJ and SPSS software , and the levels of transient / persistent LPS - treated ECs were set as controls ( A ) . The color bar represents the relative levels . The box plots show the effect of Lat - A on the nuclear levels of C / EBPδ in the transient LPS - treated ECs / persistent LPS - treated VCs ( B ) . This confirms that F - actin acts as an intermediator connecting the substrate viscosity and infection duration to immune responses . More than 50 cells were analyzed under each condition . transient infection ( Fig . 4B ) , indicating the differences between the transient LPS - treated ECs and VCs as well as those between the untreated ECs and VCs were barely related to F - actin extensions ; for the macrophages subjected to persistent activation , solidities dramatically increased on both the elastic and viscoelastic substrates after 4 h LPS treatment and decreased in 6 h LPS - treated ECs and VCs ( Figs . 2C and 4B ) . Moreover , solidities of the persistent LPS - treated ECs and VCs appeared to be disparate . For These results , especially the sudden increase ( 4 h ) and decrease ( 6 h ) in the number of filopodia in the persistent LPS - treated cells , suggest that it is necessary to distinguish between elongation and nucleation during actin polymerization under persistent infection and identify the differences between ECs and VCs in more detail . Although the formation of filopodia also requires the nucleation stage , we assessed relative existence of nucleation to elongation , not the process itself . Given the resultant F - actin structures were blurred , we attempted to depict characteristics of F - actin through a holistic approach . First , we applied steerable filters [ 55 ] and the Li algorithm to pretreat and binarize the fluorescent pictures and extracted F - actin structures in persistent LPS - treated macrophages . Afterwards , we denoted the lengths and nodules of F - actins using Euler - like number [ 56 ] , which represented the bias towards actin nucleation or elongation . Compared to ECs , VCs infected with LPS for 4 h tended to elongate beyond nucleate ( Fig . 4C ( left ) ) . Whereas , 6 h LPS - treated VCs exhibited larger Euler - like numbers suggesting the predominance of the actin nucleation process ( Fig . 4C ( right ) ) . However , the transient stimulation might be too short to produce explicit F - actin structures . The relative existences bias towards elongation or nucleation at different times likely play distinct roles in TRL4 - induced inflammation . In the light of nucleation tendency increased with duration of infection , ATF3 related to actin nucleation [ 57 ] were considered subsequently . And we also focused on its upstream NF - κB and C / EBPδ that play a significant role in discriminating between the transient and persistent LPS - induced signals [ 18 ] . 3 . 6 . Effects of substrate viscosity on the gene regulatory network ATF3 has been identified as a negative regulator of TLR4 signal [ 18 , 58 ] , which is involved in the gelsolin - determined F - actin nucleation process [ 57 , 59 , 60 ] . The tendency of F - actin nucleation in VCs turned to beyond ECs at 6 h LPS treatment ( Fig . 4C ) suggested that ATF3 was likely tuned in the viscosity - regulated immune responses . Hence , we directly contrasted the transcriptional factors of ECs and VCs under transient and persistent infections and compared the corresponding differences between the macrophages on certain substrates . ATF3 participated more actively in the persistently activated VCs than ECs ( Fig . 5A ) , while VCs were more activated in the transmembrane TLR4 signals for at least 24 h ( Fig . S2 ) . Although ATF3 acted as an attenuator of the LPS signal [ 18 ] , it was counter - intuitively accumulated in the nuclei of cells with intenser M1 reaction . This paradox accounted for appropriately negative feedback in the long - term LPS stimulation and suggested that the ATF3 upstream factors were related to M1 responses dictated by substrate viscosity and duration of infection . Considering the differences between the abilities of ECs and VCs to discriminate the duration of infection , we summed the nuclear levels of initiator ( NF - κB ) and amplifier ( C / EBPδ ) in ECs and VCs under the transient and persistent TLR4 activations ( the representative pictures containing 16 segmented proteins and nuclei at certain Z - stages for nuclear level analysis are shown in Fig . S6 ) . According to the expression levels of M1 genes , it is not surprising to find higher levels of NF - κB and C / EBPδ in transient LPS - treated ECs and persistent LPS - treated VCs , respectively ( Fig . 5A ) . Interestingly , C / EBPδ presented the most significant distinction than another transcription factors between ECs and VCs under either transient or persistent stimulations ( Fig . 5A ) . Given the amplifier would not emerge in 2 h infection [ 18 ] , this result could provide a reasonable explanation for the slightly altered early M1 genes ( Fig . 2A ) . F - actin polymerization was found to direct the nuclear translocation of class II transcription factors [ 2 ] , and in this study , we confirmed the connection between F - actin polymerization and the class II transcription factor C / EBPδ by the pharmacological F - actin inhibition . Meanwhile , the higher nuclear levels of C / EBPδ in the transient LPS - treated ECs and persistent LPS - treated VCs were apparently suppressed by Lat - A ( Fig . 5B ) suggesting C / EBPδ acted as an intermediator . Overall , substrate viscosity regulated duration of infection mediated - immune responses by the F - actin - correlated transcriptional factors , and were under the control of transcriptional gene regulatory network . 4 . Discussion Macrophages serving as defenders must perceive the infection and react accordingly ; however , they often perform controversial functions when maintaining the body well - being , especially in the case of cancer and inflammation . The delicacy and plasticity of macrophages imply the mechanical properties of an extracellular environment to become one of the most important factors affecting their response . There is growing evidence that large viscosity changes occur during the inflammation and canceration in certain tissues , which even exceed stiffness variations . In this study , we focused on the influence of substrates with different viscosities on the immune responses of macrophages under the transient and persistent LPS stimulations . We found that the transient LPS - treated macrophages benefited from the elastic substrates , while the viscoelastic substrates supported the inflammatory responses of macrophages under persistent stimulation . This indicates that substrate viscosity can amplify the discrimination of immune responses between transient and persistent irritations , making VCs more sensitive receptors . Moreover , the F - actin levels also conformed to the tendency of transcriptional programs and supported the observed effects of the two substrates on inflammatory responses . Mechanistically , F - actin polymerization was directly regulated by the viscosity of substrates and transduced information to transcription factors serving as the second transducer in the regulatory circuit . The initiator ( NF - κB ) and amplifier ( C / EPBδ ) involved in discriminating between transient and persistent infections agree well with the inflammatory responses and F - actin levels in the differences between ECs and VCs . Interestingly , the relative amount of the attenuator ( ATF3 ) was also consistent with the positive transcription factors , which leads to timely attenuation even in the immune - promoted macrophages due to their substrates . These results demonstrate that the inflammatory tissues attached to high viscosity substrates amplify the discrimination between transient and persistent infections by suppressing and promoting the responses to the transient and persistent irritation , respectively . Moreover , the F - actin - correlated transcription factors dictated by the viscosity of substrates may facilitate the immune cognition in inflammatory or cancerous tissues . There is growing evidence that the mechanical properties of some tissues ( such as stiffness ) may be changed by certain diseases [ 61 ] . In soft tissues , the focus on stiffness variations is gradually shifting to viscoelasticity [ 62 ] . Although viscoelasticity is difficult to quantify by a few parameters , the qualitative results obtained for soft tissues inspired us to examine the different effects between the viscoelastic and elastic extracellular environments . Rubiano et al . found that inflamed chronic 17 pancreatitis regions exhibited high levels of viscosity , while the microenvironment of pancreatic tumors resembled elastic materials [ 6 ] . Qiu et al . and Levental et al . tested breast tissues by different methods and concluded that malignant tumors behaved like elastic materials [ 7 , 8 ] . However , viscoelasticity was not properly controlled in previous studies , which could negatively affect the accuracy of the obtained data . For this reason , we utilized two types of substrates with different viscoelasticity properties expressed by the loss angle δ . Almost pure elastic gels with δ close to zero mimicked malignant tumor tissues , and the viscoelastic gels resembled normal or inflamed tissues . Their storage moduli were equal to approximately 3 KPa , which was consistent with that of soft tissues such as the pancreas [ 63 ] . Note that tissue stiffness influences the macrophage plasticity through YAP , Rho - associated ROCK1 / 2 , etc . [ 4 , 24 ] as well as the migration mode and phagocytosis [ 3 ] . Moreover , the results of recent studies suggested that the hydrophilicity of materials ( to be precise , the amounts and compositions of proteins absorbed by gels ) determined the inflamed states of macrophages through different integrin types [ 21 , 64 ] . Therefore , we closely monitored the density of adhesion sites to prevent interferences into the immune responses . In addition , we verified the distribution of these sites by BCA protein assay and fluorescence images . The densities of fibronectin observed on the elastic and viscoelastic substrates were almost identical . Macrophages sensitively change their morphology , functions , and mobility under external stimuli [ 65 ] . Several studies have shown that macrophage plasticity affected by chemical factors can be coregulated by biophysical cues [ 2 ] , including physical properties and active physical stimulation , such as the interstitial flow [ 66 , 67 ] . The macrophage abilities to discriminate the duration of infection and control the reaction dynamics are extremely important . However , the role of biophysical factors in macrophage behaviors under various duration of infection or dynamics of biochemical cues remained understudied . In this work , we compared the inflammatory responses of ECs and VCs under transient and persistent infections , and found that the transient LPS - treated macrophages generated higher responses on the elastic substrates , while the responses to the persistent LPS stimulations were promoted by the viscoelastic substrates . After normalizing the differences between the expression levels of M1 genes in ECs under the transient and persistent stimulations , it was concluded that VCs could better discriminate between transient and persistent TLR4 signals . The alterations in the morphology of macrophages directed by biochemical and biophysical cues and morphology effects on immune response were also detected ; however , the obtained conclusions were not consistent . Rodell et al . and Jain et al . demonstrated that M1 - like macrophages ( mouse ) preferred a round morphology and that M2 - like macrophages ( mouse ) had elongated shapes [ 30 , 68 ] , which were also assumed by the human monocyte - derived macrophages under M1 induction [ 3 ] . Even the elongated shapes of mouse macrophages can direct anti - inflammatory responses without biochemical stimulations [ 69 ] , this is not possible for human macrophages [ 70 ] . M1 macrophages increase the circularity and cell area upon activation , and spatial confinement can suppress the immune activity by F - actin inhibition [ 2 , 30 ] . The role of F - actin polymerization has been verified for both M1 [ 2 , 24 , 71 ] and M2 stimulations [ 69 ] . Although viscoelastic substrates are actively involved in cell area and morphology adjustments [ 10 ] , F - actin polymerization and the cell morphology ( not the cell area ) are strongly correlated with the viscoelasticity - dictated inflammatory responses of mouse macrophage RAW264 . 7 cells in this study , where filopodia - related morphology changes were dictated by the F - actin elongation . We found that the F - actin levels in VCs were higher than those on ECs without LPS stimulation ; under transient stimulation , the F - actin levels of ECs slightly exceeded those of VCs , and their values became predominant in persistent LPS - treated VCs . These fluctuations demonstrated that substrate viscoelasticity and biochemical cues coregulated F - actin polymerization reaction . In addition , a clutch - like model was developed to simulate the ratios of the F - actin levels in VCs to ECs under 18 different LPS durations . We also pharmacologically inhibited the F - actin levels in transient LPS - treated ECs and persistent LPS - treated VCs by Lat - A , which confirmed the correlation between F - actin polymerization and the substrate - related M1 transcriptional programs . In a related study , Sun et al . showed that F - actin rapid responses to an external force through direct mechano - transduction were accompanied with alterations in gene expression [ 72 ] . The changes in the morphology of persistent LPS - treated macrophages involved the sudden appearance and disappearance of slender actin extensions . Filopodia are actin - rich , finger - like cellular protrusions that likely participate in the migration and extracellular environment sensation processes [ 73 , 74 ] . Owing to their importance and brief appearance , we used solidity ( defined as the area / convex area ratio in ImageJ software ) to describe the number and length of filopodia in ECs and VCs . After scanning the fluorescence images and performing a solidity analysis , it was found that the formation of slender extensions was likely caused by 4 - h persistent infection and that these extensions disappeared at longer infection durations . Almost no F - actin extensions were observed in other situations . Actin elongation were considered to support filopodia and actin nucleation promoted their formation [ 73 - 75 ] . In this study , we investigated relative existence of nucleation to elongation in the persistent ( 4 - h ) LPS - treated ECs and VCs because of the difference in solidity ( the state of filopodia ) between these two systems . Although the F - actin structures were not sufficiently clear to exhibit arranged fibers , their Euler - like numbers depicted the relative amounts of nodules and filaments . The higher relative number of nodules in the persistent ( 4 - h ) LPS - treated ECs as compared with that in VCs directed their bias toward nucleation , which was consistent with the solidity data . After 2 h of additional stimulation , VCs possessed larger relative value of nucleation / elongation in contrast to ECs . The inflammatory responses in VCs promoted by persistent stimulation also timely attenuated as those in persistent LPS - treated ECs , which might benefit from the transformation of F - actin elongation domination to the nucleation domination . There is growing evidence that ATF3 facilitates actin nucleation through gelsolin [ 56 , 58 , 59 ] and also plays an important role as an immune attenuator [ 18 ] , which implies its involvement in the viscosity - related modification of inflammatory reactions under transient and persistent LPS stimulation . Macrophages are sensitively percept to not only the infection type but also the irritation dynamics , including its amplitude and duration . It was reported previously that C / EBPδ acting as an amplifier could discriminate transient and persistent infections [ 18 ] , and were related to chronic inflammation , consequently [ 76 ] . Hence , we analyzed the nuclear levels of the transcription factors in a regulatory circuit consisting of an initiator ( NF - κB ) , an amplifier ( C / EBPδ ) , and an attenuator ( ATF3 ) . These transcription factors exhibited higher nuclear levels in the transient LPS - treated ECs and persistent LPS - treated VCs , which was consistent with the tendency of the late M1 gene expression . Of note , no exceptions were observed for the ATF3 attenuator . The biggest gap between the nuclear levels of the transcription factors in ECs and VCs emerged at C / EBPδ regardless of the type of the TRL4 activation ( transient or persistent ) . The slight NF - κB alterations may explain the relatively weak effect of the viscoelastic substrates on the early M1 genes . In summary : under transient LPS infection , the immune responses of VCs were inferior to those of ECs ; under persistent LPS infection , VCs were more activated than ECs . This result also demonstrated that substrate viscosity allowed macrophages to discriminate duration of infection more sensitively , which was mechanistically supported by F - actin polymerization - related transcription factors . These findings may facilitate the immune cognition of the role of inflammatory ( highly viscous ) and cancerous ( almost elastic ) microenvironments . The transcriptional levels of the late M1 genes in VCs under transient LPS stimulations were lower than those in ECs and surpassed them under persistent infection . Meanwhile , the early M1 genes exhibited slightly differences between ECs and VCs measured at 2 h infection . F - actin polymerization was actively involved in 19 these phenomena and accurately predicted by the developed clutch - like model . Moreover , we verified the participation of a regulatory circuit including the initiator , amplifier , and attenuator in the viscoelasticity - related immune reactions through the F - actin polymerization adjustment . Various reactions of macrophages on the substrates with different viscosities mimicking the inflammatory and cancerous mechanical environments suggest a possible distinction in discriminating between transient and persistent infection . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first study that comparatively investigates the effects of viscoelastic and elastic substrates on the inflammatory responses of macrophages under both the transient and persistent infections . Elucidating the roles of inflammation / canceration - related viscosity and biochemical cues may facilitate remodeling of the immune microenvironment to prevent a disease . 5 . Conclusion In this study , the macrophages under transient irritation exhibit higher inflammatory intensities on the elastic substrates , whereas the macrophages under persistent infection generate more active immune responses . After normalizing the difference between the EC reactions under transient and persistent LPS stimulations , we have found that the viscoelastic substrates amplify the difference between the inflammatory intensities obtained at these two conditions . Mechanistically , F - actin is directly regulated by the mechanical properties of substrates and can be affected by infection . The comprehensive cues that regulate F - actin levels dictate the translocation of transcription factors corresponding to transcriptional programs . The C / EBPδ amplifier in class II is the most apparent transcription factor altered by substrate viscosity . Interestingly , the ATF3 attenuator also exhibits proportional variations to the initiator and amplifier , which ensure timely attenuation of the inflammatory responses in promoted macrophages . The findings of this work suggest that the viscoelasticity of the extracellular microenvironment strongly affects the inflammatory responses to transient and persistent infections and , therefore , can be used to regulate the macrophage ability to discriminate duration of infection . These results imply that the chaotic immune responses in severe infection and tumors may be impacted by the viscosity of ECM and require works to be more precise and thorough on real tissues .

( A ) ( B ) Figure S1 : Frequency dependence of storage modulus and fibronectin coating Storage moduli G’ of elastic gels under frequency sweep from 0 . 1rad / s to 10rad / s present independently to frequency ( A ) . sulfo - SANPAH was used to activate PAA gels and then fibronectin was chemically crosslinked on elastic or viscoelastic gels . We first quantified the amount of FN by BCA Protein Assay Kit in rest FN solution after overnight incubation and measured mean fluorescence intensities from gel surfaces fluorescently tagged with anti - fibronectin antibody . These results show little difference in crosslinked fibronectin between two kinds of gels . ( A ) ( B ) Figure S2 : Relative expression levels of late M1 genes Quantitative real - time RT - PCR analysis of the late responsive genes , IL - 6 and IL - 1b , were executed on both ECs and VCs under persistent LPS treatment . This picture presented that the distinctions in expression level of late M1 genes resulted from viscosity of substrates kept at least 24 hours . It also implied that gels have little immune effects on macrophages without extra stimulation and 100ng / ml LPS were sufficient for fully activating ( A ) . It is obvious that transient LPS treated macrophages on either elastic nor viscoelastic substrates showed inferior immune responses compared to persistent LPS treatment . ( A ) ( B ) ( C ) ( D ) ( E ) Figure S3 : F - actin levels and cell spreading areas LPS treatment would arouse increment in F - actin levels , but did not increase proportionally to time increasement . The increments resulted from LPS were also different between ECs and VCs ( A ) . The alternations in cell spreading areas were in the same trend as F - actin levels increments , but show some delay . And the distinctions between ECs and VCs were undermined ( B ) , so we focused on the effects of F - actin later . Clear comparison between F - actin levels and cell sizes of ECs and VCs under 2h and 6h LPS stimulations confirmed the role of F - actin in viscosity - affected immune responses ( C ) ( D ) . Moreover , the difference between ECs and VCs in cell spreading areas were in contrast to F - actin levels for transient LPS treatment , which were also in the contrary to the differences in expression levels of M1 genes . Together , polymerizations of F - actin are more likely to involve in . > 50 cells were analyzed for each condition ; significance of difference was accessed with two - tailed Student’s t - test ( ns ( not significant ) , * ( p≤0 . 05 ) , * * ( p≤0 . 01 ) , * * * * ( p≤0 . 0001 ) ) .

Detailed montage of F - actin organization and levels , at different Z - sections , between ECs ( A ) , VCs ( B ) , ECs under persistent LPS ( 4h ) ( C ) and VCs under persistent LPS ( 4h ) ( D ) . Z step = 0 . 8 um , scale bar = 10 µm . Macrophages on elastic substrates were smaller but thicker than on viscoelastic substrates ; after persistent LPS stimulation , cells on viscoelastic substrates seemed to be larger and thicker than on elastic substrates directing to more activated states . ( A ) ( B ) ( C ) ( D ) Figure S5 : Integrin - FN binding dynamics predict force generation in response to substrate stiffness and viscosity Cellular traction force , proportional to F - actin polymerization , were predicted by a clutch - like model with reinforcement . The difference between ECs and VCs altered twice under distinct durations of LPS were completed by the alternations in binding rate and threshold reinforcement force . The traction force of cells on elastic substrates ( ~ 3Kpa ) shown as grey star ; for cells on viscoelastic substrates , we estimated the average of traction force corresponding to stiffness close to 3KPa , which was determined by exponentially decreased stiffness of viscoelastic gels and that smaller than . In the situation without stimulation , the traction force of VCs was slightly larger 𝜏 s 𝜏 𝑏 than ECs ( A ) ; under transient LPS , the traction force from ECs turn to exceed VCs ( B ) ; with the increase in duration of LPS , cellular traction force of VCs prevail over ECs again ( C ) . The relationship between F - actin polymerization dissociation rate and traction force of one clutch were shown in ( D ) . According to the formula of integrin - 𝐾 𝑎𝑐𝑡 , 𝑜𝑓𝑓 actin dissociation , it’s obvious that force for one clutch could not be greater than 20 𝑟 𝑜𝑓𝑓 ∗ exp ( 𝐹 𝑐 , 𝑖 𝐹 ∗ⅈ𝑛𝑡 ‒ 𝜙 𝑖𝑛𝑡 ) 𝐹 𝑐 , 𝑖 pN , which imply positive correlation between actin polymerization and traction force .

Macrophages barely have focal adhesion , which was experimentally tested with length in micrometer order , so we chose the adhesion site with radius R = 0 . 25 μm .
