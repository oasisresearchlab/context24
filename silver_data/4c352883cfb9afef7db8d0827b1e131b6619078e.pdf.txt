However , we currently lack a detailed under - standing of how chromatin and gene expression patterns are coordinated during developmental tran - sitions in the cardiac lineage . Here , we interrogated the transcriptome and several histone modiﬁcations across the genome during deﬁned stages of cardiac differentiation . We ﬁnd distinct chromatin patterns that are coordinated with stage - speciﬁc expression of functionally related genes , including many human disease - associated genes . Moreover , we discover a novel preactivation chromatin pattern at the pro - moters of genes associated with heart development and cardiac function . We further identify stage - speciﬁc distal enhancer elements and ﬁnd enriched DNA binding motifs within these regions that predict sets of transcription factors that orchestrate cardiac differentiation . Together , these ﬁndings form a basis for understanding developmentally regulated chro - matin transitions during lineage commitment and the molecular etiology of congenital heart disease . INTRODUCTION Developmental decisions during lineage commitment are pre - cisely coordinated at the genome level as broad gene expres - sion programs are jointly activated or repressed ( Davidson , 2010 ) . Heart development requires the concurrent differentiation of cardiovascular cell types including endothelial cells , smooth muscle cells , and cardiomyocytes that must be organized into a complex organ . This process involves speciﬁcation of pluripo - tent cells to mesodermal and cardiac precursors prior to terminal differentiation ( Evans et al . , 2010 ; Murry and Keller , 2008 ; Srivas - tava , 2006 ) . Thus , heart development depends on precise temporal control of gene expression patterns , and disruption of transcriptional networks in heart development underlies con - genital heart disease ( CHD ) ( Bruneau , 2008 ; Evans et al . , 2010 ; Srivastava , 2006 ) . It is not known how groups of genes are cor - egulated during lineage commitment in the cardiac lineage . Chromatin regulation is fundamental in specifying different cell types during embryonic development and in generating cellular responses to the environment . Studies in mammalian cells have shown that histone modiﬁcations are correlated with active , repressed , and poised expression states and deﬁne cell state ( Barski et al . , 2007 ; Cui et al . , 2009 ; Ernst et al . , 2011 ; Guenther et al . , 2007 ; Mikkelsen et al . , 2007 ; Zhou et al . , 2011 ) . Histone marks also predict noncoding DNA elements , such as distal enhancers , that regulate tissue - speciﬁc gene expression ( Creyghton et al . , 2010 ; Ernst et al . , 2011 ; Heintzman et al . , 2009 ; Heintzman et al . , 2007 ; Rada - Iglesias et al . , 2011 ; Zentner et al . , 2011 ) . Although we have considerable knowledge of the epigenetic landscape of speciﬁc cell types , how chromatin states are coordinated with gene expression during lineage commitment is poorly understood . Emerging evidence indicates that faulty epigenetic regulation contributes to congenital heart disease ( Chang and Bruneau , 2012 ) . Mutations in the histone methyltransferase MLL2 in 206 Cell 151 , 206 – 220 , September 28 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . humans cause congenital heart defects in Kabuki syndrome ( Ng et al . , 2010 ) . Transcription factors implicated in inherited congenital heart disease , such as Tbx5 and Nkx2 - 5 , interact with histone modifying enzymes to regulate gene expression ( Miller et al . , 2008 ; Miller et al . , 2010 ; Nimura et al . , 2009 ) . The H3K27 methyltransferase Ezh2 regulates gene expression programs that are important for heart development and homeo - stasis ( Delgado - Olguı´n et al . , 2012 ; He et al . , 2012 ) . In addition , epigenetic changes at cardiac - speciﬁc genes are observed during direct reprogramming of cardiac ﬁbroblasts into cardio - myocytes ( Ieda et al . , 2010 ) . Therefore , dissecting the dynamic chromatin and transcriptional landscapes during cardiomyocyte differentiation is critical for understanding heart development and will improve our ability to design stem cell - based therapies for cardiac - related diseases . Here , we have deﬁned the dynamic epigenetic and transcrip - tional landscapes during cardiac differentiation . We used a directed differentiation system representing the stepwise differ - entiation of mouse embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) into cardiomyo - cytes ( CM ) that allows for isolation of developmental intermedi - ates , including mesoderm ( MES ) and cardiac precursors ( CP ) . We analyzed histone modiﬁcations at promoters to deﬁne chro - matin states that accompany gene expression changes during cardiac differentiation . By using a dynamic model of lineage determination , we discovered previously unknown chromatin state transitions , including a preactivation pattern associated with a set of genes with cardiac functions . We also used chro - matin marks to discover thousands of stage - speciﬁc enhancers that may deﬁne new transcriptional networks deployed during cardiac differentiation . Our data illustrate the strengths of a differentiation time course in identifying gene regulatory networks and reveal a chromatin - level determination of cell fates in the earliest stages of differentiation that may be key to heart development . RESULTS Expression and Chromatin States in Cardiac Differentiation We investigated how global patterns of gene expression and chromatin organization are coordinated in the cardiac lineage . We used directed differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) tocardiomyocytesasamodelsystem ( FigureS1available online ) . This approach reproduces normal cardiomyocyte differ - entiation ( Kattman et al . , 2011 ) and resulted in roughly 70 % cardiac Troponin T ( cTnT ) - positive cardiomyocytes ( Figure S1 and Movie S1 ) . Differentiating cultures were highly enriched at earlier stages for the cardiac transcription factors Nkx2 - 5 and Isl1 , indicating that these cells progress efﬁciently through nor - mal cardiac differentiation ( Figure S1 ) . Based on marker gene analysis , we selected four stages of differentiation that represent keycelltypesinthetransitionfrompluripotentcellstocardiomyo - cytes ( Figure 1A ) : undifferentiated embryonic stem cells ( ESC ) expressing pluripotency genes ( Pou5f1 / Oct4 and Nanog ) , cells expressing mesodermal markers ( Mesp1 and Brachyury ) ( MES ) , cells expressing cardiac transcription factors ( Nkx2 - 5 , Tbx5 , and Isl1 ) but not yet beating ( CP ) , and functional CM with cardio - myocyte - speciﬁc gene expression ( Myh6 and Myh7 ) . We analyzed global expression patterns of polyadenylated transcripts and microRNAs ( miRNAs ) in the four cell types by RNA sequencing ( RNA - Seq ) and Nanostring , respectively . We identiﬁed over 13 , 500 genes expressed during the time course ( reads per kilobase per million [ RPKM ] > 1 ) . Genes were clus - tered by expression pattern using HOPACH ( Pollard et al . , 2005 ) , yielding distinct clusters ( Figure 1B , Figure S2 , Table S1 ) , including groups of genes speciﬁcally expressed at each stage ( e . g . , Clusters A , L , N , and S ) . The stage - speciﬁc clusters were enriched for expected Gene Ontology ( GO ) terms ( Table S2 ) . Using the Nanostring platform , we analyzed over 600 miRNAs and found that they also display dynamic and stage - speciﬁc expression ( Figure 1C , Table S1 ) . Our data conﬁrmed expression of key ESC miRNAs , such as the miR290 cluster , as well as known cardiac miRNAs ( including miR - 1 , miR - 208 , and miR - 143 ) in the CM stage . These data also identify several other stage - speciﬁc miRNAs that represent potential new regu - lators of cardiac differentiation . Long ncRNAs ( lncRNAs ) are noncoding polyadenylated tran - scripts with emerging roles in gene regulation ( Pauli et al . , 2011 ) . LncRNAs are differentially expressed in mammalian cell types , suggesting roles in lineage commitment ( Cabili et al . , 2011 ) . However , lncRNAs have not yet been implicated in heart development . Notably , we ﬁnd that lncRNAs show striking stage - speciﬁc expression in our differentiation system ( Fig - ure 1D , Table S1 ) . LncRNAs regulate gene expression in cis and trans and may also function as transcriptional enhancers ( Ørom et al . , 2010 ) . We expected that if lncRNAs function in cis to regulate lineage commitment , then their neighboring genes should have functions related to this process . To test this idea , we determined GO enrichment for the two nearest genes relative to lncRNAs expressed > 1 RPKM in at least one stage ( Figures 1D and 1E ) . Consistent with our hypothesis , we found enrichment of genes involved in development , morphogenesis , and transcrip - tional processes ( Figure 1F ) . We ﬁnd that lncRNAs identiﬁed in our data are signiﬁcantly correlated in expression with their neighboring genes compared to randomly selected neighboring protein coding genes ( hyper - geometric test p = 4 3 10 (cid:1) 32 ) . We tested the possibility that the observed correlations are attributable to coordinately regu - lated gene clusters , however , we ﬁnd that lncRNA expression is more highly correlated with the nearest adjacent gene ( p = 0 . 0275 ) relative to our background model ( Figure 1F , Extended Experimental Procedures ) . Our data suggest that some lncRNAs may regulate gene expression in cis during cardi - omyocyte differentiation . Moreover , we ﬁnd many correlated lncRNA - gene pairs are associated with known cardiac genes such as Gata6 , Hand2 and Myocd ( Figure 1G , Table S1 ) . These data identify several potential noncoding regulators and will facil - itate further study of lncRNAs in cardiogenesis . Chromatin State Dynamics during Cardiac Differentiation Chromatin structure is key to transcriptional regulation , yet its role during differentiation is largely unknown . To this end , we per - formed chromatin immunoprecipitation and massively parallel sequencing ( ChIP - Seq ) for several histone modiﬁcations at the time points examined for gene expression ( ESC , MES , CP , and Cell 151 , 206 – 220 , September 28 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . 207 208 Cell 151 , 206 – 220 , September 28 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . CM ) . Modiﬁcations included H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 ( associ - ated with inactive and active promoters respectively ) and H3K4me1 and H3K27ac ( associated with promoters and enhancers ) ( Barski et al . , 2007 ; Cui et al . , 2009 ; Ernst et al . , 2011 ; Mikkelsen et al . , 2007 ; Zhou et al . , 2011 ) . We also deter - mined binding of RNA polymerase II phosphorylated at serine 5 ( RNAP ) , which is enriched at transcriptional start sites ( TSS ) . Given the dynamic nature of gene expression observed during cardiomyocyte differentiation , we initially focused on elucidating histone modiﬁcation patterns at transcription start sites ( TSSs ) . To identify gene promoters with similar patterns , we performed unsupervised clustering of ChIP signal 2 kb around the TSS of each gene ( Figure 2A , Table S1 , and Extended Experimental Procedures ) . Consistent with previous studies showing little variation of chromatin patterns at promoters across cell types ( Heintzman et al . , 2009 ) , the largest cluster , Cluster 1 , had high levels of H3K4me3 , H3K27ac , and RNAP ( all associated with active chromatin and transcription ) across the time course . GO analysis showed that these genes are involved in fundamental cellular functions , such as metabolism and cell - cycle regulation ( Table S3 ) . Other clusters , however , revealed dynamic chromatin patterns , suggesting chromatin regulation is critical to cardiac gene expression and differentiation . Dynamic Chromatin States Correlate with Distinct Expression Patterns We considered that genes with similar temporal expression patterns would share a common chromatin pattern . Conversely , Figure 2 .

Cell 151 , 206 – 220 , September 28 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . 209 common expression patterns may be represented by multiple different chromatin patterns . To test this , we tabulated the number of genes shared between each chromatin and expres - sion cluster and determined statistical enrichment ( Figure 2B ) . We found that the mesoderm - speciﬁc expression cluster L is primarily associated with chromatin cluster 9 . However , the ESC - speciﬁc expression cluster A , comprising genes rapidly silenced upon differentiation , correlated with several chromatin patterns , including chromatin cluster 5 , where active marks are lost without gain of additional marks tested , and cluster 11 , where active marks are gradually lost while gaining the repres - sive H3K27me3 modiﬁcation ( Figure 2A ) . Regulators of stem cell state fell into more than one cocluster ( A11 Pou5f1 / Oct4 , and A5 Nanog ) , suggesting expression of pluripotency regula - tors is controlled by multiple epigenetic mechanisms . We next examined how chromatin and expression patterns were coordinated at each stage of differentiation . We ﬁnd that genes with similar expression patterns showed considerable variation in chromatin states during differentiation . For instance , genes in cocluster A11 include active genes with highly corre - lated chromatin states at the ESC stage ( Figure 3 ) . Upon differ - entiation , these genes were downregulated at the MES stage . However , this initial change in expression did not correlate with changes in chromatin until later in differentiation at the CP stage . Conversely , genes in the mesoderm - speciﬁc expression Cluster L9 ( Figure 3B ) , which are expressed at the MES stage and repressed at the CP stage , correspondingly have highly corre - lated active MES and silent CP chromatin states . Our analysis also revealed that chromatin patterns could distinguish functionally distinct genes with a similar expression pattern ( Figure 3C ) . For example , expression cluster S com - prises genes expressed at the CM stage that are associated with diverse chromatin patterns , such as H3K4me3 and no H3K27me3 ( S3 ) , H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 ( S8 and S10 ) , and gain of low levels of H3K4me3 during differentiation without H3K27me3 enrichment ( S20 , S23 , S24 , S26 , S27 , and S28 ) . However , each subgroup includes genes involved in distinct processes , including metabolism ( S3 ) , signaling ( S8 and S10 ) , and muscle contraction ( S20 , S23 , S24 , S26 , S27 , and S28 ) . This indicates that despite similar expression patterns , groups of functionally related genes can be distinguished at the chromatin level . A Novel Chromatin State Transition during CM Differentiation Our promoter clustering revealed a group of genes that showed enrichment for H3K4me1 enrichment prior to enrichment of H3K4me3 and RNA Pol II and transcriptional activation . As H3K4me1 has largely been associated with open chromatin at distal enhancers prior to activation ( Creyghton et al . , 2010 ; Ernst et al . , 2011 ; Heintzman et al . , 2009 ; Rada - Iglesias et al . , 2011 ; Zentner et al . , 2011 ) , we hypothesized that H3K4me1 may mark a similar promoter state . Although we found H3K4me3 and H3K4me1 were often enriched at the same TSSs , a fraction ( 15 % – 20 % ) of genes marked by H3K4me1 was not H3K4me3 enriched ( Figure 4A ) and was poorly expressed ( Figure 4B ) . These included many contractile protein genes , such as Actc1 , for which H3K4me1 was present at the MES stage prior to transcriptional activation at the CP and CM stages ( Figure 4C ) . Notably , H3K27me3 was not enriched at these promoters , sug - gesting that this group of genes was not repressed by Polycomb during cardiomyocyte differentiation . To gain broader insights , we classiﬁed genes based on the pattern of H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 at their TSS . We identiﬁed three gene groups that showed interesting patterns of these modiﬁcations ( Figures 4D and 4E ) . Group 1 gained H3K4me1 prior to H3K4me3 enrichment and transcriptional activation and was enriched exclusively for cardiovascular genes including those encoding contractile proteins associated with terminal differentiation and cardiomyocyte function . H3K4me1 was often maintained at these TSSs upon H3K4me3 enrichment and gene activation . Group II gained H3K4me1 over time but failed to gain H3K4me3 or robust expression and included muscle lineage genes such as Ckm , Ckmt2 , and Tcap , whose expression is associated with cardiomyocyte maturation . Group III genes transiently gained H3K4me1 at speciﬁc stages , but showed no H3K4me3 enrichment during differentiation . These genes were not expressed above background levels throughout differentia - tion and function in noncardiac lineages . Group II and III genes did not acquire H3K27me3 suggesting Polycomb - independent silencing . Although the functional role of the H3K4me1 preacti - vation pattern is unknown , chromatin remodelling at early stages of cardiac differentiation may be necessary for gene activation during terminal differentiation . Enhancer Activity Correlates with Cardiac Speciﬁc Programs Although regulation at promoters is important for gene regula - tion , distal enhancers are key regulators of tissue - speciﬁc gene expression patterns during lineage commitment . In addition to their enrichment at TSSs , H3K4me1 and H3K27ac demarcate enhancer elements in a wide range of cell types ( Creyghton et al . , 2010 ; Ernst et al . , 2011 ; Rada - Iglesias et al . , 2011 ; Zentner et al . , 2011 ) . Using these modiﬁcations , we identiﬁed 81 , 497 putative distal enhancer regions during cardiac differentiation ( Figures 5A and 5B , Figures S3A – S3C , Table S4 , and Extended Experimental Procedures ) . H3K4me1 marks most elements at each stage , whereas H3K27ac is enriched at a subset of these regions ( Figure 5A ) . The broad enrichment of H3K4me1 is con - sistent with the idea that it represents a general mark of en - hancers and open chromatin ( Creyghton et al . , 2010 ; Ernst et al . , 2011 ; Heintzman et al . , 2009 ; Rada - Iglesias et al . , 2011 ; Zentner et al . , 2011 ) . Comparing our data to H3K4me1 and H3K27ac proﬁles from neural precursors , liver , and pro B cells ( Creyghton et al . , 2010 ) revealed that our enhancers are largely unique to the cardiac lineage ( Figure S3D ) . Our predicted set of enhancers signiﬁcantly overlaps the smaller sets identiﬁed by p300 / CBP binding in fetal mouse heart , fetal or adult human hearts , or by the binding of multiple tran - scription factors in the HL1 cardiomyocyte cell line ( Blow et al . , 2010 ; He et al . , 2011 ; May et al . , 2012 ) , which supports our enhancer predictions ( Figures S3D and S3E ) . Consistent with evidence indicating that cardiac enhancers are conserved over a limited phylogenetic distance ( Blow et al . , 2010 ; May et al . , 2012 ) , we ﬁnd our predicted enhancers have low overlap with highly conserved ( > 600 ) Phastcons elements , which increases 210 Cell 151 , 206 – 220 , September 28 , 2012 ª 2012 Elsevier Inc . signiﬁcantly when considering only highly conserved elements in placental mammals ( Figures S3F and S3G ) . Thus , our analysis identiﬁed many putative heart enhancers that likely function in heart development , including novel enhancers that may regulate the transition from pluripotency to a functionally differentiated state . Histone modiﬁcation patterns can distinguish active en - hancers ( which correlate with tissue - speciﬁc expression ) from poised enhancers ( which correlate with potential gene expres - sion later in development ) ( Creyghton et al . , 2010 ; Ernst et al . , 2011 ; Rada - Iglesias et al . , 2011 ; Zentner et al . , 2011 ) . We classi - ﬁed our enhancers as active ( H3K27ac + , H3K4me1 + / (cid:1) ) or poised ( H3K4me1 + only ) at each stage of differentiation ( Fig - ure 5C ) . We ﬁnd most enhancers at a given stage are poised , whereas a smaller subset is active . We then compared enrich - ment patterns of several other histone modiﬁcations and RNAP with these enhancer regions . We ﬁnd that RNAP is highly en - riched at active enhancers ( Figure 5C ) , consistent with Figure 3 .

Conversely , although H3K27me3 has been shown to demarcate poised enhancers elements ( Rada - Iglesias et al . , 2011 ; Zentner et al . , 2011 ) , this mark had a minimal overlap with our enhancer regions ( Figure S4 ) . Thus , while poised and active enhancers can be broadly deﬁned by a limited set of histone modiﬁcations , there likely exist many other substates that comprise functionally distinct enhancer states . To test whether active enhancers correlate with stage speciﬁc gene expression , we assigned active enhancers to their single nearest gene ( Table S4 ) and found that genes associated with active enhancers are expressed at signiﬁcantly higher levels than genes associated with unmarked or poised enhancers at each stage ( Figure 5D ) . GO analysis of genes associated with active enhancers revealed enriched categories that progres - sively become cardiomyocyte - speciﬁc ( Figure 5E , Figure S5A , Table S5 ) . For example , enhancer - associated genes at the MES stage function in mesoderm and embryonic pattern speci - ﬁcation , whereas at the CP stage they function in heart morpho - genesis and cardiac tissue development . In CMs , we observe Figure 5 .

Many of these genes have important roles in heart development and their dysregulation is associated with heart defects and cardiovascular disease ( Bruneau , 2008 ; Srivastava , 2006 ) . Thus , we identiﬁed many new putative enhancers that correlate with genes involved in cardiac speciﬁcation during embryonic development . Enhancer Transitions during CM Differentiation To dissect enhancer state transitions that govern cardiac gene expression programs , we clustered enhancers according to their states ( unmarked , poised , or active ) at each stage ( Figure 6A ) . The set of active and poised enhancers is largely unique at each stage , indicating that enhancers are highly cell type - speciﬁc even between closely related cell types . A subset of enhancers showed poised - to - active state transi - tions concomitant with activation of the proximal gene ( e . g . , Myh7 and Nkx2 - 5 ) ( Figure 6B , Figure S6 ) . However , most poised enhancers failed to acquire an active state during cardi - omyocyte differentiation . These initially poised enhancers may be required to specify cell fates in other lineages during early development , suggesting that cells retain signiﬁcant plasticity during lineage commitment . The dynamic cell - type speciﬁcity of enhancer usage sug - gested that transitions between poised and active enhancer states occur rapidly between stages . Consistent with this , comparing enhancer states between each stage of cardiac differentiation showed that the fraction of active enhancers that transition through a poised state is largest during the MES to CP and CP to CM transition and lowest between unrelated cell types ( Figure 6C and Figure S5 ) . Although enhancer transi - tions between ESCs and the differentiated cell types remain below (cid:3) 5 % , they comprise 22 % to 56 % during the MES - CP transition , respectively ( Figure S5 ) . The cell type speciﬁcity and rapid state transitions of enhancers suggests dynamic enhancer usage is an important regulatory mechanism for coordinating tissue - speciﬁc gene expression . Integrating Enhancers into Gene Networks Although enhancers regulate global developmental gene expression patterns , integrating these genomic elements into the core transcriptional regulatory circuitry is challenging . Tran - scription factors ( TFs ) can act as master regulators of gene expression programs by binding to speciﬁc motifs within cis - regulatory elements . Given the stage - speciﬁc expression of TFs in our time course ( Figure 7A , Figure S2 ) , we hypothesized that motifs for TFs that drive cardiac development would be en - riched in active enhancers . Reasoning that TFs bind open chro - matin regions ( He et al . , 2010 ; Verzi et al . , 2010 ) , we developed an algorithm to ﬁnd depressions in the H3K27ac chromatin proﬁle at active enhancer regions and used these regions to search for motifs . We found over - represented motifs at each stage , including those for TFs that regulate the ESC state ( OCT4 _ 01 , LRH1 _ Q5 , and 500seq _ marson ) and cardiac devel - opment ( GATA _ Q6 , MEF _ Q6 _ 01 , MEIS1BHOXA9 _ 02 , and SRF _ C ) ( Figure 7B ) . We compiled a list of TFs known to bind these highly conserved motifs and found strong correlations between TF expression and motif enrichment at each stage ( Fig - ure 7C ) . To address whether these predictions represented binding events , we analyzed ChIP - Seq data for OCT4 and SOX2 in ESCs ( Marson et al . , 2008 ) and GATA4 in the HL - 1 car - diomyocyte cell line ( He et al . , 2011 ) . OCT4 and SOX2 bound regions substantially overlapped the OCT4 _ 01 and SOX9 _ B1 motifs at enhancers in ESCs ( p = 2 3 10 (cid:1) 74 and 3 3 10 (cid:1) 26 ) ( Fig - ure S5D ) . GATA4 bound regions strongly correlated with en - hancers that have a GATA _ Q6 motif ( p = 3 3 10 (cid:1) 74 and 2 3 10 (cid:1) 30 respectively ) at the CP and CM stage . To construct gene regulatory networks connected to speciﬁc TF - motif pairs , we selected target genes positively correlated with TF expression . We ﬁnd that many of these pairs were asso - ciated with genes that function in common pathways . For example , at the CP stage , MEIS , GATA , and NFATC enhancer - associated genes comprise networks implicated in cardiovas - cular development and function ( Figure 7D , Figure S7 ) . Although Meis1 and Meis2 have been implicated in heart development ( Crowley et al . , 2010 ; Pfeufer et al . , 2010 ; Stankunas et al . , 2008 ) , their targets in cardiac differentiation are unknown . Our data suggest MEIS1 / 2 regulate a subset of genes important in cardiac morphogenesis . Moreover , GATA factors potentially bind enhancers that may regulate important cardiac genes , including Nkx2 - 5 , Mef2c , and Gata4 itself ( Bruneau , 2008 ; Sri - vastava , 2006 ) . We further tested our enhancer predictions by analyzing the effects of loss of function of particular TFs on gene expression . Genes in the predicted OCT4 - regulated network were highly correlated with genes affected by Oct4 knockdown ( p = 3 3 10 (cid:1) 44 ) ( Loh et al . , 2006 ) . Despite considerable redundancy among GATA factors ( Zhou et al . , 2012 ) , we found the GATA4 network also predicted many genes differentially regulated in Gata4 knockdown HL - 1 cells ( He et al . , 2011 ) ( p = 9 3 10 (cid:1) 12 at CP stage , p = 9 3 10 (cid:1) 15 at CM stage ) . These data indicate that we have identiﬁed a set of TFs that may regulate specialized gene expression networks by binding to distinct sets of en - hancers during cardiomyocyte differentiation . Combinatorial interactions among transcription factors can increase the diversity of regulatory modules governed by a par - ticular factor . We observed a signiﬁcant overlap among target genes associated with enhancers containing MEIS1BHOXA9 _ 02 and GATA _ Q6 motifs at the CP stage ( Figure 7E , Table S6 ) . Upon further analysis , we identiﬁed groups of developmentally impor - tant genes regulated by only GATA , only MEIS , or MEIS and GATA together suggesting independent as well as coregulation Figure 6 .

Enhancers coenriched for both MEIS and GATA motifs are associated with genes important for cardiac development , such as Gata5 , Irx4 , Myocd , Zfpm2 , Wnt2 , and Smarcd3 , and with genes that inﬂuence conduction system function ( Hcn4 ) , consistent with an association of MEIS1 with conduction parameters ( Pfeufer et al . , 2010 ) . Notably , we ﬁnd MEIS / GATA motifs are often enriched in the same enhancer ( Fig - ure 7F ) , suggesting a functional relationship between these factors . We used luciferase reporter activation assays to test for core - gulation by MEIS and GATA factors . We tested ﬁve enhancers with motifs for MEIS and GATA , including a Myocd enhancer active in the developing heart ( Creemers et al . , 2006 ) . Cotrans - fection of the Myocd reporters with combinations of expression constructs for GATA4 , MEIS1A , or MEIS2D , showed that this enhancer responded to GATA4 and was synergistically activated by the combination of GATA4 and MEIS1A ( Figure 7G ) . This appeared to be speciﬁc to MEIS1A , because cotransfection of MEIS2D with GATA4 did not lead synergistic activation . Further - more , most ( four of ﬁve ) enhancers tested were synergistically activated by the combination of MEIS1A and GATA4 ( Fig - ure S7C ) . Thus GATA4 and MEIS1A can function together to activate certain cardiac enhancers . Collectively , our work reveals a detailed picture of how gene expression programs may be coordinated during lineage com - mitment and provides novel insights into the key principles that underpin heart development and disease . DISCUSSION We have deﬁned chromatin state transitions during cardiac differentiation that provide insights into the dynamic regulation of cellular differentiation and the coordinated regulation of gene expression programs . Our results show that there are complex but distinct chromatin patterns that accompany lineage decisions . Dynamic Epigenetic Transitions in Differentiation The rapid loss of expression of pluripotency - associated genes upon differentiation can be achieved by at least nine different chromatin patterns . These patterns comprise broad groups that include loss of active marks ( e . g . , Nanog ) , or gradual loss of active marks with the simultaneous acquisition of repressive marks ( e . g . , Oct4 / Pou5f1 ) . Conversely , during cardiac differenti - ation , we observed striking coherence among most mesoderm - speciﬁc genes , which share a speciﬁc chromatin pattern . On the other hand , genes expressed in later development can be clas - siﬁed by multiple distinct chromatin regulatory patterns that may precisely coordinate precursor and differentiated cardio - myocyte gene expression programs . Our data also reveal that chromatin patterns can predict sets of functionally related genes . For example , genes associated with metabolic function share a similar chromatin pattern , whereas those involved in contractile function and sarcomere structure have a distinct pattern , although they share a similar expression proﬁle . This implies that functionally related and coexpressed genes have speciﬁc modes of regulation . Distinct modes of epigenetic regulation may exist to ensure that functional gene modules are synchronized , thus ensuring robust and coordinated expression of key processes that may be critical for cell function and importantly for adaptation to stress . A Novel Dynamic Pattern of Histone Modiﬁcations Analysis of chromatin states during cardiomyocyte differentia - tion has led to the identiﬁcation of novel patterns that are highly informative to understand developmental regulatory programs . In particular , we have identiﬁed a pattern of H3K4me1 deposition at the TSS that precedes the transcriptional activation and acquisition of H3K4me3 and recruitment of RNAP . This preacti - vation pattern is consistent with the idea that molecular events in early lineage commitment mark genes for subsequent activation . A similar pattern has been observed in T cell differentiation , in which H3K4me2 precedes transcriptional activation for a select group of genes ( Zhang et al . , 2012 ) . This preactivation pattern is likely important for genes that are not regulated by Polycomb complexes . The presence of H3K4me1 in anticipation of tran - scriptional activation is reminiscent of its presence at poised enhancers , for which only a minority show H3K27me3 enrich - ment . It is possible that H3K4me1 may mark regulatory elements such as proximal enhancers that may function to poise the TSS for activation . These data suggest that diverse mechanisms can poise speciﬁc classes of TSSs and enhancers for subsequent activation . We propose that early deposition of H3K4me1 at speciﬁc cardiac genes is a regulated step that facilitates later activation of these genes . It will be important to identify the chro - matin regulator that is necessary to catalyze this modiﬁcation as well as the factors required for its recruitment and whether the early deposition of this mark is required for proper activation of these genes .

We have identiﬁed a large number of enhancers that show stage - speciﬁc activation . This richdatasethasallowedustodiscovertranscriptionfactormotifs that predict novel enhancer - driven transcriptional regulatory networks during cardiomyocyte differentiation . For example , we identiﬁed networks for the GATA family of transcription factors that include GATA4 , GATA5 , and GATA6 in CP and CM stages . The GATA factors are known to orchestrate many developmental processes . In the developing heart , these transcription factors have broad roles in early differentiation , morphogenesis , and postnatal physiology ( Zhao et al . , 2008 ; Zhou et al . , 2012 ) . Muta - tionsin GATA4 leadtocongenitalheartdefects ( Gargetal . , 2003 ) , highlighting the importance of elucidating how these factors regulate gene expression programs in heart development . We also discovered potential new regulators of cardiac development . We identiﬁed enrichment for the MEIS1BHOXA9 motif , which predicts the binding of Meis factors , perhaps along with a partner Hox factor , at a subset of enhancers at the CP stage . Meis1 has been implicated in heart development because Meis1 null mice display congenital heart defects ( Stan - kunas et al . , 2008 ) and because MEIS1 has been identiﬁed in genome - wide association studies ( GWAS ) of human arrhythmias ( Pfeufer et al . , 2010 ) . Chromosomal deletions that include MEIS2 have also been identiﬁed in patients with congenital heart defects ( Crowley et al . , 2010 ) . Our expression data show that both Meis1 and Meis2 are robustly and transiently activated at the CP stage , consistent with a role in cardiac progenitors . Thus , we have identiﬁed a novel network potentially under control of Meis factors . Finally , we observed a striking overlap between GATA - and the MEIS1BHOXA9 - binding sites at en - hancers , and show that these enhancers can respond to GATA4 and Meis1 in reporter assays . Thus we have uncovered a previously unknown functional relationship between GATA and Meis TFs in heart development . Together , our study establishes a platform to understand the process of cardiomyocyte differentiation and provides an opportunity to identify mechanisms of complex disease loci by comparison with GWAS . Moreover , our data lay the foundation for understanding how the epigenetic landscape of cardiac differentiation integrates transcriptional inputs during normal development . These insights will be valuable to develop im - proved cardiac reprogramming strategies ( Ieda et al . , 2010 ; Qian et al . , 2012 ; Song et al . , 2012 ; Takeuchi and Bruneau , 2009 ) and to elucidate how disruption of these diverse regulatory modules contributes to congenital heart disease . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Detailed experimental and analysis methods can be found in the Extended Experimental Procedures . Cardiomyocyte Differentiation and Analysis E14 Tg ( Nkx2 - 5 - EmGFP ) mouse ES cells ( Hsiao et al . , 2008 ) were cultured in feeder - free conditions using standard techniques . Directed differentiations andanalyseswereperformedessentiallyasdescribedin ( Kattmanetal . , 2011 ) . RNA - Seq and Analysis Pipeline Total RNA was isolated from 5 3 10 6 cells using TRIzol Reagent . Sequencing libraries were prepared according to Illumina RNA - Seq library kit with minor modiﬁcations . Paired - end RNA - Seq 36 base pair reads were aligned to mm9 ( Mus musculus assembly July 2007 ) . DESeq ( Anders and Huber , 2010 ) was used to normalize raw read counts and analyze differential gene expres - sion . USeq 7 . 0 ( Nix et al . , 2008 ) was then used to generate gene - level read counts and estimate RPKM ( reads per kilobase of exon per million reads map - ped ) . Onlygeneswithexpressionvalues > 1RPKMinatleastonecelltypewere considered for subsequent analysis . Expression was normalized to the inter - quartile range across the time course ; interquartile numbers were used for clustering using a cosine angle distance metric and the Hopach cluster - ing package ( http : / / www . bioconductor . org / packages / 2 . 1 / bioc / html / hopach . html ) . ChIP - Seq and Analysis Pipeline Genome - wide localization of histone modiﬁcations ( H3K4me3 , H3K4me1 , H3K27me3 , and H3K27ac ) and the serine 5 phosphorylated form of RNA Pol II for each stage was determined via chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing . Chromatin immunoprecipitations were per - formed according tothe Young lab protocol ( Lee et al . , 2006 ) with minor modi - ﬁcation . Details on analysis pipeline can be found in Extended Experimental Procedures . Transient Transactivation Assays for Enhancer Validation Candidate enhancers were cloned into a modiﬁed pGL3 luciferase reporter construct . Expression constructs for Gata4 , Meis1a , and Meis2d ( 250 ng each ) were cotransfected with each reporter construct ( 500 ng each ) in 10T1 / 2 cells . Luciferase activity was assessed 40 hr later and normalized to Renilla luciferase activity . Conditions were analyzed for statistical differences using a one - way repeated - measures ANOVA followed by Tukey’s Multiple Comparison Test .
