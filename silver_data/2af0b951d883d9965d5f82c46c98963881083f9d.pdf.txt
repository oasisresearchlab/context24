We previously showed that the F - 4 BAR and SH3 domain Syndapin / PACSIN - family protein SDPN - 1 is required in vivo for basolateral 5 endocytic recycling in the C . elegans intestine . Here we sought to determine the significance of 6 a predicted interaction between the SDPN - 1 SH3 domain and a target sequence in PXF - 1 / PDZ - 7 GEF1 / RAPGEF2 , a known exchange factor for Rap - GTPases . We found that endogenous 8 mutations we engineered into the SDPN - 1 SH3 domain , or its binding site in the PXF - 1 protein , 9 interfere with recycling in vivo , as does loss of the PXF - 1 target RAP - 1 . Rap - GTPases have been 10 shown in several contexts to negatively regulate RhoA activity . Our results show that RHO - 11 1 / RhoA is enriched on SDPN - 1 and RAP - 1 positive endosomes in the C . elegans intestine , and 12 loss of SDPN - 1 or RAP - 1 elevates RHO - 1 ( GTP ) levels on intestinal endosomes . Furthermore , we 13 found that depletion of RHO - 1 suppressed sdpn - 1 mutant recycling defects , indicating that 14 control of RHO - 1 activity is a key mechanism by which SDPN - 1 acts to promote endocytic 15 recycling . RHO - 1 / RhoA is well - known for controlling actomyosin contraction cycles , although 16 little is known of non - muscle myosin II on endosomes . Our analysis found that non - muscle 17 myosin II is enriched on SDPN - 1 positive endosomes , with two non - muscle myosin II heavy 18 chain isoforms acting in apparent opposition . Depletion of nmy - 2 inhibited recycling like sdpn - 1 19 mutants , while depletion of nmy - 1 suppressed sdpn - 1 mutant recycling defects , indicating 20 actomyosin contractility in controlling recycling endosome function . 21 Introduction 22 Cells internalize extracellular material , receptor - associated ligands , membrane proteins and 23 lipids by endocytosis ( 1 ) . Uptake mechanisms can be generally divided into clathrin - dependent 24 and clathrin - independent endocytosis ( CDE and CIE , respectively ) , after which internalized 25 cargo is sorted within endosomes for delivery to distinct intracellular destinations ( 2 ) . As 26 membrane and fluid are added to the early endosome by incoming vesicles , narrow - diameter 27 recycling tubules form , collecting a subset of cargo ( 3 ) . Most plasma membrane lipids , and 28 many types of internalized transmembrane proteins , are recycled back to the plasma 29 membrane either directly ( rapid recycling ) , indirectly via the endocytic recycling compartment 30 ( ERC ) ( slow recycling ) , or Golgi ( retrograde recycling ) ( 3 , 4 ) . As early endosomes mature they 31 become late endosomes , eventually fusing with lysosomes , promoting degradation of 32 remaining cargo . Many cellular processes depend upon accurate and efficient endocytic 33 recycling , including cell migration , cell division , cell - cell fusion events , and control of neuronal 34 signaling during learning and memory ( 3 , 4 ) . Trafficking pathways are often more elaborate in 35 the context of polarized cells such as epithelia and neurons that maintain multiple functionally 36 distinct plasma membrane domains , e . g . basolateral versus apical in epithelia , and dendrite 37 versus axon in neurons ( 4 ) . 38 The C . elegans intestine is a polarized epithelial tube consisting of exactly 20 cells that form 39 nine donut - like rings , the most anterior ring consisting of four symmetrical cells and all other 40 rings comprised of two cells ( 5 , 6 ) . The intestinal cells have a basolateral surface that faces the 41 pseudocoelom and controls the exchange of molecules between the intestine and the rest of 42 the body ( 5 ) . The microvilli - rich apical surface faces the central lumen and is important for 43 nutrient uptake ( 6 ) . We previously developed the C . elegans intestine as a model system for the 44 study of polarized epithelial trafficking mechanisms , allowing analysis of transport in the native 45 context of a polarized - epithelial tube within the intact living animal ( 7 - 10 ) . Taking advantage of 46 the C . elegans intestinal system , our laboratory previously showed that C . elegans SDPN - 1 , a 47 Syndapin / PACSIN family protein , is important for basolateral endocytic recycling in vivo , a 48 finding confirmed independently by others ( 9 , 11 ) . 49 Syndapin / PACSIN family proteins bear a single N - terminal F - BAR domain and a single C - terminal 50 SH3 domain . BAR domains in general , including the F - BAR subclass , are known to sense 51 membrane curvature and to promote positive curvature , properties likely to help drive 52 membrane budding and tubulation ( 12 ) . Our previous work showed that C . elegans SDPN - 1 is 53 essential for the basolateral recycling of cargo proteins that are transported via the early 54 endosome – to – recycling endosome route , but not other routes ( Gleason et al . , 2016 ) . Affected 55 cargos accumulate at much higher - than - normal levels in the endosomes of sdpn - 1 mutants 56 ( Gleason et al . , 2016 ) . These include well characterized model cargo proteins hTAC ( human IL - 2 57 receptor α - chain ) , hTFR ( human transferrin receptor ) , and DAF - 4 ( type - II TGF - β receptor ) , but 58 not MIG - 14 / Wls or SMA - 6 ( type - I TGF - β receptor ) that recycle via the retromer pathway , or 59 CD4 - LL that does not recycle ( Gleason et al . , 2016 ) . SDPN - 1 protein is highly enriched on early 60 and basolateral recycling endosomes of the intestinal cells , and sdpn - 1 null mutants display 61 abnormal accumulation of early and basolateral recycling endosomes , suggesting a direct role 62 in their regulation ( Gleason et al . 2016 ) . Mammalian Syndapin2 is also well known to associate 63 with recycling endosome proteins and to promote endocytic recycling , but many questions 64 remain about the mechanism by which Syndapin / PACSIN proteins regulate endosomal function 65 ( 13 - 15 ) . 66 To better understand how SDPN - 1 promotes recycling we sought to identify partner proteins 67 relevant to recycling , with a particular focus on results from the C . elegans SH3 - ome project 68 ( 16 ) . Here we investigated one high - confidence hit for the SDPN - 1 SH3 domain , PXF - 1 / PDZ - GEF , 69 an exchange factor for the small Ras - like GTPase RAP - 1 / Rap ( 17 , 18 ) . Importantly we show that 70 PXF - 1 and its target RAP - 1 also regulate recycling like SDPN - 1 , and interfering with the 71 interaction of SDPN - 1 and PXF - 1 disrupts recycling . We trace the activity of RAP - 1 on 72 endosomes to negative regulation of RHO - 1 and myosin II heavy chain isoform NMY - 1 , and 73 show that reduction in RHO - 1 or NMY - 1 greatly ameliorates sdpn - 1 mutant trafficking defects . 74 This function appears to work in opposition to myosin II heavy chain isoform NMY - 2 that we 75 find is required for recycling . Taken together our results indicate that myosin II regulation is a 76 key output of endosomal SDPN - 1 that is essential to maintain recycling function . 77 78 Materials and Methods 79 General methods and strains 80 All C . elegans strains were derived from Bristol strain N2 and cultured at 20°C on NGM plates 81 seeded with the Escherichia coli strain OP50 . A list of strains used in this study can be found in 82 Supplemental Table 1 . 83 Transgenic Strains 84 To construct GFP or RFP fusion transgenes for expression in the worm intestine , Gateway 85 destination vectors were used . Each vector contained the promoter region of the intestine - 86 specific gene vha - 6 , followed by GFP , mScarlet , or tagRFP coding sequences , a Gateway 87 cassette ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) , and let - 858 3 ' UTR sequences . The genomic or cDNA 88 sequences of C . elegans genes were cloned individually into entry vector pDONR221 . Mutant 89 forms of the coding regions were obtained using site - directed mutagenesis using the 90 Quikchange II kit ( Stratagene ) . Coding regions were transferred into P vha - 6 - GFP or P vha - 6 - RFP 91 vectors by LR reaction ( Invitrogen ) . Constructs were bombarded into unc - 119 ( ed3 ) mutant 92 animals to establish low copy integrated transgenic lines , or integrated in single copy using the 93 MiniMos system and Hygromycin or G418 selection ( 19 ) . 94 RNAi 95 C . elegans RNAi - mediated interference was performed as described ( 20 ) . Feeding constructs in 96 this study were from the Ahringer library , except for rho - 1 , for which a cDNA was cloned into 97 the L4440 / pPD129 . 36 vector between unique SacI and HindIII sites ( 21 ) . RNAi clones for nmy - 1 98 and nmy - 2 were kindly provided by Adriana Dawes ( Ohio State University ) ( 22 ) . For most RNAi 99 experiments , synchronized L4 stage animals were grown on RNAi plates at 20°C . After the first 100 generation , we transferred about 60 L4 stage animals to fresh RNAi plates at 20°C for another 101 24 hours prior to imaging as young adults . 102 Protein Expression , Pulldown Assays , and Western Analysis 103 N - terminally hemagglutinin ( HA ) - tagged PXF - 1 protein , amino acids 1 - 477 , with or without 104 mutation of the predicted SDPN - 1 binding site , was synthesized in vitro using the TNT - coupled 105 transcription - translation system ( Promega , Madison , WI ) using DNA templates pcDNA3 . 1 – 106 2xHA - PXF - 1 and pcDNA3 . 1 – 2xHA - PXF - 1 ( K191 / P195 / P198 - > AAA ) , respectively ( 1 . 6 ug / each 50 - 107 ul reaction ) . The reaction cocktail was incubated at 30°C for 90 min . Control glutathione S - 108 transferase ( pGEX - 2T ) , GST - SDPN - 1 SH3 ( final 112 amino acids ) , and GST - SDPN - 1 SH3 ( P479L ) 109 fusion proteins were expressed in the ArcticExpress strain of Escherichia coli ( Stratagene , La 110 Jolla , CA ) . Bacterial pellets were lysed in 10 ml B - PER Bacterial Protein Extraction Reagent 111 ( Pierce , Rockford , ILL ) with Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets ( Roche , Indianapolis , 112 IN ) . Extracts were cleared by centrifugation , and supernatants were incubated with 113 glutathione - Sepharose 4B beads ( Amersham Pharmacia , Piscataway , NJ ) at 4°C overnight . 114 Beads were then washed six times with cold STET buffer ( 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 115 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 ) . In vitro – synthesized HA - tagged protein ( 10 ul TNT mix diluted in 116 500 ul STET ) was added to the beads and allowed to bind at 4°C for 2 h . After six additional 117 washes in STET the proteins were eluted by boiling in 30 ul 2X - SDS - PAGE sample buffer . Eluted 118 proteins were separated on SDS - PAGE , blotted to nitrocellulose , visualized with Ponceau S and 119 scanned , then washed to remove Ponceau staining , and probed with anti - HA ( 16B12 ) 120 antibodies and HA - conjugated secondary antibodies ( Pierce ) . Detection was achieved using 121 Super Signal West Pico detection system ( Pierce ) . 122 CRISPR 123 sdpn - 1 P479L and pxf - 1 K191 / P195 / P198 - > AAA mutations were introduced into the 124 endogenous genes in C . elegans using the dpy - 10 co - CRISPR technique as described by Paix and 125 Seydoux ( 23 ) , creating mutant alleles sdpn - 1 ( pw33 ) and pxf - 1 ( pw34 ) . 3XFLAG - GFP was inserted 126 into the pxf - 1 gene between the last codon and stop codon using the SEC selection technique 127 described by Dickinson as modified by Schwartz ( 24 , 25 ) . 128 Microscopy and image analysis 129 Imaging was performed on live first - day adult hermaphrodites animals mounted on slides using 130 5 % agarose pads with 10 mM levamisole . Most single channel data in Figure 2 was captured on 131 a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope . All other single channel data , including Figure 2B - B’ , was 132 captured on a Zeiss LSM 800 confocal microscope . For both microscopes , the LSM 710 and LSM 133 800 , GFP tagged protein image acquisition used the 488 nm laser line and the 63X ( 1 . 4 NA ) 134 objective and ZEISS ZEN 2 . 3 imaging software . True GFP signal was separated from the broad - 135 spectrum auto - fluorescence displayed by the lysosome - related organelles ( gut granules ) of the 136 C . elegans intestine using the Spectral Fingerprinting and Linear Unmixing functions in ZEN . The 137 images were exported as TIF files for analysis in Metamorph version 7 . 7 software . 138 The “Integrated Morphometry Analysis” function of Metamorph was used to measure 139 fluorescence intensity , puncta number ( structure count ) , and fluorescence area ( total area ) 140 within unit regions . At least 9 animals were used for each analysis . Fluorescence signal in the 141 basolateral membrane between two neighboring cells was avoided for the analysis . 142 For multiwavelength fluorescence colocalization studies , images were obtained using a 143 spinning - disk confocal imaging system : Axiovert Z1 microscope ( Carl Zeiss Microimaging ) 144 equipped with a X - Light V2 Spinning Disk Confocal Unit ( CrestOptics ) , 7 - line LDI Laser Launch 145 ( 89 North ) , Prime 95B Scientific CMOS camera ( Photometrics ) and 63X and 100X oil - immersion 146 objectives . Data were captured as an image stack with 0 . 2 μm step size using Metamorph 147 version 7 . 7 software ( Universal Imaging ) , and deconvolved using Autoquant X3 ( Media 148 Cybernetics ) . In Metamorph , a single plane from each image stack ( either top plane or middle 149 plane ) was chosen in which both markers were clearly visible . In the middle plane of the worm 150 intestine , the apical membranes and the basolateral membranes are visible , while on top plane 151 images only the basolateral membrane is visible . Images taken in the DAPI channel were used 152 to identify broad - spectrum intestinal autofluorescence caused by lysosome - like organelles . The 153 DAPI channel image was subtracted from the green and red channel images to remove 154 autofluorescent signal from the colocalization analysis . The DAPI subtraction was done using 155 the Metamorph “Arithmetic” function at 16 - bit depth . Quantification of colocalization 156 ( Manders coefficients ) in autofluorescence subtracted images was performed using open 157 source Fiji ( Image J ) software and the “Colocalization Threshold” function . At least 9 animals 158 were used for each analysis . For middle plane images , the fluorescence signal in the apical 159 membrane and the basolateral membrane between two neighboring cells were avoided . 160 Statistical analysis 161 Quantified data obtained in this study was graphed and statistically analyzed using GraphPad 162 Prism 7 . 04 software . 163 164 Results 165 166 The SDPN - 1 SH3 domain binds to PXF - 1 via a specific proline - rich sequence 167 Syndapin family proteins , also known as PACSINs , contain an N - terminal F - BAR domain ( FCH - 168 BAR , Fes / CIP4 homology - Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs ) and a C - terminal SH3 ( Src - homology 3 ) domain 169 ( 14 ) . C . elegans has a single Syndapin family member SDPN - 1 , while the situation in mammals is 170 more complex , with three Syndapin family members Syndapin1 / PACSIN1 , Syndapin2 / PACSIN2 , 171 and Syndapin3 / PACSIN3 ( 26 ) . Syndapins form dimers through their F - BAR domains , with the F - 172 BAR dimer forming a mildly curved structure that binds directly to membrane phospholipids 173 ( 14 ) . Higher order assemblies of these proteins scaffold the membrane to promote bending and 174 remodeling , in many cases producing membrane tubulation ( 26 ) . Indeed , our previous work 175 showed that full - length recombinant C . elegans SDPN - 1 tubulates acidic membranes in vitro ( 9 ) . 176 In vivo SDPN - 1 localizes to early endosomes and basolateral recycling endosomes in the C . 177 elegans intestine , and is required for basolateral recycling , but the molecular mechanism ( s ) by 178 which it mediates endocytic recycling remain poorly understood ( 9 ) . To gain a better 179 understanding of how SDPN - 1 promotes endosomal transport we sought to identify partner 180 proteins that work with SDPN - 1 in this process . 181 The SH3 domain is a peptide recognition module for proline - rich sequences that is well - known 182 for mediating specific protein - protein interactions ( 27 ) . Thus , we focused on the SDPN - 1 SH3 183 domain as a molecular entry point to identify direct SDPN - 1 binding partners . We were aided in 184 this goal by the C . elegans SH3 - interactome project ( 16 ) , a large - scale analysis that used peptide 185 phage display to define the binding preferences for most SH3 - domains encoded in the C . 186 elegans genome , including generating a weighted SDPN - 1 SH3 consensus target sequence ( Fig . 187 1A ) . The SH3 interactome project also screened directly for SDPN - 1 SH3 - domain interacting 188 proteins using a stringent yeast - 2 - hybrid approach . Importantly , both approaches identified the 189 protein PXF - 1 as a prime SDPN - 1 SH3 domain candidate . The project recovered PXF - 1 via 190 genome - wide yeast - 2 - hybrid with a SDPN - 1 SH3 bait , but not any of the other SH3 domain 191 baits , and independently identified PXF - 1 amino acids 191 - 198 as the second - best match for 192 the SDPN - 1 SH3 - binding consensus in the entire predicted C . elegans proteome ( 16 ) . 193 PXF - 1 ( PDZ - GEF or RAGEF in mammals ) is a well - characterized exchange factor for the small 194 Ras - like GTPases RAP - 1 / Rap1 and RAP - 2 / Rap2 , and Rap - GTPases have been implicated in some 195 endocytic recycling events in other organisms , further suggesting that a SDPN - 1 / PXF - 1 196 interaction could be relevant to understanding the role of SDPN - 1 in recycling ( 17 , 28 - 30 ) . PXF - 1 197 has a complex domain structure , with two RCBD - like domains : one near the N - terminus , and 198 the other more centrally located ( 17 , 31 ) . While RCBD domains in some proteins bind to cAMP , 199 biochemical analysis of human PDZ - GEF2 , a PXF - 1 ortholog , failed to identify any cyclic - 200 nucleotide binding for these RCBD - like domains ( 32 ) . The predicted SDPN - 1 SH3 binding site at 201 residues 191 - 198 resides in a predicted unstructured region between the two RCBD - like 202 domains ( https : / / alphafold . ebi . ac . uk / entry / G5EDB9 ) . PXF - 1 also contains REM ( Ras Exchange 203 Motif ) , PDZ ( PSD - 95 , Dlg , and ZO - 1 homology ) , RA ( Ras Association ) , and GEF ( Guanine 204 nucleotide Exchange Factor ) domains , as well as a C - terminal VSRV sequence that may interact 205 with PDZ - domains ( Fig 1B ) ( 17 ) . 206 207 To better analyze the ability of the SDPN - 1 SH3 domain to bind to PXF - 1 , and test the 208 importance of the predicted binding site identified as a strong match to the phage - display 209 consensus sequence , we performed GST pulldown experiments . As baits we compared GST , 210 GST - SH3 sdpn - 1 ( + ) , and GST - SH3 sdpn - 1 ( P478L ) . The P478L mutation in the SDPN - 1 SH3 domain is 211 equivalent to mammalian Syndapin I P434L , which was previously shown to abolish the ability 212 of the Syndapin I SH3 domain to bind partner proteins ( 33 ) . These baits were paired with in 213 vitro translated HA - PXF - 1 ( 1 - 478 ) bearing the wild - type sequence , or with the consensus - 214 matching PXF - 1 ( 191 - 198 ) SH3 binding site mutated ( K GPA P LP P to A GPA A LP A ) ( Fig 1A - B ) . We 215 found that HA - PXF - 1 ( + ) interacted robustly with GST - SH3 sdpn - 1 ( + ) , but not GST or GST - SH3 sdpn - 216 1 ( P478L ) , indicating the specificity of the interaction . Moreover , we found that mutation of HA - 217 PXF - 1 at the predicted interaction sequence ( 191 - 198 ) abolished the interaction with GST - 218 SH3 sdpn - 1 ( + ) , despite other proline - rich sequences remaining in the PXF - 1 prey protein . Taken 219 together these results indicate that the SDPN - 1 SH3 domain can bind to PXF - 1 , and the 220 predicted binding site at aa191 - 198 is crucial for this interaction . 221 222 The SDPN - 1 / PXF - 1 interaction is important for endocytic recycling 223 Given our binding results we hypothesized that the interaction of the SDPN - 1 SH3 - domain with 224 PXF - 1 is important for SDPN - 1 - mediated regulation of endocytic recycling . To interfere with this 225 interaction in vivo we used CRISPR - mediated genome editing to create C . elegans mutants 226 sdpn - 1 ( pw33 ) and pxf - 1 ( pw34 ) , in which the same point mutations that interfered with the 227 SDPN - 1 / PXF - 1 binding interaction in vitro were engineered into the endogenous sdpn - 1 and 228 pxf - 1 genes in vivo ( Fig . 1b ) . While pxf - 1 null mutations are lethal ( 17 ) , pxf - 1 ( pw34 ) is a viable 229 allele . 230 In particular we found that the interaction - defective mutants sdpn - 1 ( pw33 ) and pxf - 1 ( pw34 ) 231 displayed gross over - accumulation of intestinal GFP : : RME - 1 marked basolateral recycling 232 endosomes and GFP : : RAB - 5 marked early endosomes in the central cytoplasm ( middle plane 233 Fig . 2K ) , very similar to phenotypes we had previously observed in null mutants for sdpn - 1 ( Fig . 234 2 , panel A - A’’ and B - B’’ ; Fig . S1 A , A” ) ( 9 ) . For GFP : : RME - 1 labeled recycling endosomes we 235 measured endosome fluorescence intensity and number . In the case of GFP : : RAB - 5 , the 236 mutants accumulated so many early endosomal compartments that it was not possible to 237 segment the images to quantify endosome number , so in addition to fluorescence intensity we 238 measured the the percent of total cytoplasmic area labeled by GFP : : RAB - 5 . 239 We also tested the importance of the SDPN - 1 / PXF - 1 interaction in cargo trafficking , focused on 240 well - characterized model endocytic recycling cargoes markers hTAC ( human IL2 - receptor alpha - 241 chain ) and hTFR ( human transferrin receptor ) tagged with GFP , both of which depend upon 242 SDPN - 1 for their recycling ( 9 , 10 ) . hTAC is a clathrin - independent cargo that recycles via the 243 recycling endosome in an ARF - 6 - dependent pathway ( 34 , 35 ) , while hTFR is clathrin - dependent 244 in its endocytosis and also recycles via recycling endosomes ( 10 ) . Previous studies showed that 245 sdpn - 1 null mutants display dramatic endosomal accumulation of hTAC and hTFR within the 246 intestinal cells ( 9 ) . Importantly , we observed that the interaction - defective mutants caused 247 intracellular accumulation of recycling cargoes similar to that previously observed upon the 248 complete loss of SDPN - 1 ( Fig . 2 , panel C - C’’ and D - D’’ ) . Taken together , our results indicate that 249 a SDPN - 1 / PXF - 1 interaction is important for the function of the basolateral recycling pathway . 250 251 The RAP - 1 GTPase cycle is required for endocytic recycling 252 Since C . elegans PXF - 1 and its mammalian homologs are specific GDP / GTP exchange factors for 253 Rap - GTPases in vivo and in vitro ( 17 , 36 , 37 ) , we surmised that the role of the SDPN - 1 / PXF - 1 254 interaction is to activate Rap - GTPases to promote endocytic recycling . To test this hypothesis , 255 we analyzed the effect of a rap - 1 ( 0 ) mutant on relevant markers in vivo . Indeed , we found that 256 rap - 1 null mutants displayed significantly increased accumulation of RAB - 5 marked early 257 endosomes and RME - 1 marked recycling endosomes , as well as increased intracellular 258 accumulation of recycling cargo markers hTAC : : GFP and hTFR : : GFP , supporting this hypothesis 259 ( Fig . 2 , panel A’’’ , B’’’ , C’’’ , D’’’ , F , H - J ; Fig . S1 A , A” ) . Interestingly , we also identified abnormal 260 accumulation defects for recycling cargo and endosome markers in a GTPase - defective rap - 261 1 ( re180 ) mutant ( 38 ) , bearing the G12V mutation at the endogenous gene ( Fig . 2B’ , C’’’’ , D’’’’ , 262 E’’’’ , F , G , I - J ; Fig . S1 A’ ) . These results indicate a requirement for the full RAP - 1 GTP / GDP - cycle , 263 rather than a simple requirement for active RAP - 1 . We also tested for effects of sdpn - 1 ( 0 ) and 264 rap - 1 ( 0 ) mutants on GFP - tagged C . elegans GLUT1 homolog FGT - 1 , a glucose transporter known 265 to be naturally expressed in the C . elegans intestine ( 39 ) . Loss of SDPN - 1 and RAP - 1 produced 266 similar intracellular retention of FGT - 1 : : GFP , also suggesting a defect in recycling ( Fig . S2 ) . Taken 267 together these results support an important role for RAP - 1 in regulating recycling downstream 268 of SDPN - 1 and PXF - 1 . 269 270 PXF - 1 and RAP - 1 are enriched on early and basolateral recycling endosomes 271 To further interrogate SDPN - 1 , PXF - 1 , and RAP - 1 for shared function together in recycling , we 272 compared the localization of PXF - 1 and RAP - 1 with SDPN - 1 in the context of the intestinal 273 epithelium within the intact whole animal . We also compared RAP - 1 localization to 274 independent early endosome and basolateral recycling endosome markers with which SDPN - 1 275 is known to colocalize ( 9 ) . We found that endogenously tagged PXF - 1 : : GFP colocalized with 276 intestinal SDPN - 1 : : tagRFP indicating significant residence of PXF - 1 with SDPN - 1 on basolateral 277 endosomes ( Fig 3 A - A’’’’and E ) . We also identified strong colocalization of intestinal SDPN - 278 1 : : GFP with tagRFP : : RAP - 1 , indicating that at any given time most SDPN - 1 overlaps with RAP - 1 279 on the same endosomes ( Fig 3 B - B’’’’and E ) . We did note that RAP - 1 distribution appeared 280 broader than that of SDPN - 1 , as reflected in a lesser but still substantial Manders’ coefficient 281 for the reverse comparison ( Fig 3E ) . RAP - 1 labeling of structures that were SDPN - 1 - negative 282 could reflect endosomal microdomains lacking SDPN - 1 , and / or additional RAP - 1 positive 283 organelle types such as late endosomes ( 40 ) . We also observed considerable overlap between 284 tagRFP : : RAP - 1 and basolateral recycling endosome marker GFP : : RME - 1 ( Fig 3C - C’’’ ) , and early 285 endosome marker GFP : : RAB - 5 ( Fig 3D - D’’’ ) , further supporting the interpretation that SDPN - 1 286 and RAP - 1 are present on the same early and basolateral recycling endosomes where they 287 could function together to regulate endocytic recycling . 288 289 RHO - 1 is enriched on SDPN - 1 and RAP - 1 positive endosomes 290 Given our findings indicating that RAP - 1 signaling functions downstream of SDPN - 1 to promote 291 recycling , we sought to better understand the relevant target of RAP - 1 for this process . While 292 previous studies of Rap - GTPases had not identified a target of Rap - signaling for regulation of 293 recycling , some reports indicated that mammalian Rap1 or Rap2 can negatively regulate RhoA 294 to promote mammalian epithelial cell spreading , endothelial barrier function , or ECM stiffness 295 mechanotransduction , in part via ARHGAP29 ( 41 - 45 ) . We hypothesized that misregulation of 296 endosomal Rho - GTPase activity could explain sdpn - 1 / pxf - 1 / rap - 1 associated phenotypes . 297 Supporting this notion , we found that mutation of spv - 1 , the closest C . elegans homolog of 298 ARFGAP29 , resulted in an increase in RME - 1 labeled recycling endosome number , similar to the 299 defect displayed in pxf - 1 and rap - 1 mutants ( Fig . S3 ) . 300 Given these results , we tested for a role of SDPN - 1 and RAP - 1 in the regulation of endosomal 301 RHO - 1 , the only C . elegans homolog of RhoA ( 46 ) . First , we assayed for enrichment of RHO - 1 on 302 the relevant endosomes in the C . elegans intestine , the expected location for direct function as 303 part of the basolateral recycling pathway . Indeed we found that nearly all SDPN - 1 : : GFP positive 304 structures contained tagRFP : : RHO - 1 ( Fig 4 A - A’’’’ and 4C ) , while tagRFP : : RHO - 1 was also present 305 on SDPN - 1 negative structures ( Fig 4 A - A’’’’ and 4C ) . Importantly , GFP : : RHO - 1 and tagRFP : : RAP - 306 1 colocalized very well , with most endosomes positive for one also positive for the other ( Fig . 4 307 B - B’’’ and 4C ) . Taken together , these results indicate that RHO - 1 is enriched on the same 308 endosomes as SDPN - 1 and RAP - 1 , pointing to the potential for a SDPN - 1 / PXF - 1 / RAP - 1 module 309 influencing endosomal RHO - 1 activity . 310 311 SDPN - 1 and RAP - 1 negatively regulate RHO - 1 312 If RHO - 1 is regulated by SDPN - 1 and RAP - 1 , we might expect to find a change in RHO - 1 313 subcellular localization in sdpn - 1 and rap - 1 mutants . Indeed , we found an increased 314 accumulation of GFP : : RHO - 1 in intracellular puncta in both mutants ( Figure S4 ) . This result was 315 suggestive , but was not sufficient to define any changes in RHO - 1 GTP - level . 316 To directly test for effects of sdpn - 1 and rap - 1 mutants on intestinal endosomal RHO - 1 317 activation state , we co - expressed a RHO - 1 ( GTP ) biosensor ( GFP : : AHPH ) ( 47 ) with tagRFP : : RHO - 318 1 , assaying for changes in GFP : : AHPH recruitment to tagRFP : : RHO - 1 labeled endosomes in the 319 intestine . If SDPN - 1 normally acts to negatively regulate RHO - 1 activation via RAP - 1 signaling , 320 we would expect sdpn - 1 and rap - 1 mutants to show increased RHO - 1 activation , leading to 321 increased GFP : : AHPH recruitment . Indeed , we measured a significant increase in the 322 colocalization of RHO - 1 and its active - state biosensor on intracellular structures in sdpn - 1 or 323 rap - 1 null mutant backgrounds , indicating abnormally high RHO - 1 ( GTP ) levels on intestinal 324 endosomes ( Fig . 4D - G ) . Importantly , there was no change in GFP : : AHPH colocalization and 325 tagRFP : : RHO - 1 on the apical plasma membrane , indicating the specificity of this regulation ( Fig 326 4H ) . This data suggests a model in which a critical function of the SDPN - 1 / PXF - 1 / RAP - 1 pathway 327 is to prevent the inappropriate overactivation of RHO - 1 on endosomes that could interfere with 328 recycling function . 329 RHO - 1 functions downstream of SDPN - 1 to regulate endocytic recycling 330 A corollary to this model is that reducing RHO - 1 levels could be expected to compensate for 331 elevated RHO - 1 activation in sdpn - 1 mutants , leading to rescue of sdpn - 1 endocytic recycling 332 defects . To test this hypothesis directly , we used RNAi to deplete RHO - 1 in a sdpn - 1 mutant 333 background and assayed for effects on recycling endosomes and endocytic recycling cargo . 334 Since rho - 1 is an essential gene , we established RNAi conditions that strongly depleted RHO - 1 , 335 as verified in a tagRFP : : RHO - 1 strain ( Fig . S5 ) , but allowed development to the adult stage 336 typically used in our assays . Remarkably , this RNAi - mediated depletion of RHO - 1 fully 337 suppressed sdpn - 1 null mutant defects that normally result in abnormal accumulation of 338 GFP : : RME - 1 - labeled recycling endosomes and hTAC : : GFP recycling cargo ( Fig . 6 , panel A - B’’’’ ) . 339 These results strongly support regulation of endosomal RHO - 1 as a key factor in the SDPN - 1 - 340 dependent regulation of endocytic recycling . 341 Non - muscle myosin II is a key regulator of recycling downstream of SDPN - 1 , RAP - 1 and RHO - 1 342 Given our results with RHO - 1 , we sought greater insight into which RHO - 1 - mediated activities 343 influence recycling . C . elegans RHO - 1 and mammalian RhoA are well known for regulating 344 actomyosin contractility through non - muscle myosin II ( 48 , 49 ) . In support of a roll for myosin II 345 in this pathway , we found that SDPN - 1 colocalized with MLC - 4 , the myosin II regulatory light 346 chain reported to function with non - muscle myosin II heavy chain isoforms NMY - 1 and NMY - 2 347 ( Fig . 4 , panel C - C’’’ and D ) . We also found that loss of SDPN - 1 increased intracellular 348 accumulation of punctate MLC - 4 intracellular signal suggesting increased recruitment to 349 endosomal membranes ( 50 ) . 350 If regulation of myosin II contraction cycling is a key output of SDPN - 1 / PXF - 1 / RAP - 1 signaling 351 for endocytic recycling , forced activation of myosin II activity might be expected interfere with 352 endosome function . Indeed , we found that forced activation of non - muscle myosin II in the 353 intestine via expression of a constitutively active phosphomimetic form of MLC - 4 ( MLC - 4 ( DD ) ) 354 ( 50 ) , increased intracellular retention of recycling cargo hTAC : : GFP , and resulted in intracellular 355 accumulation of RAB - 5 and RME - 1 marked endosomes ( Fig . 6 , panel E - H ; Fig S1C’ - C’’ ) . These 356 results support a requirement for myosin II regulation on endosomes for successful endocytic 357 recycling . 358 To investigate myosin II requirements further , we assayed for effects of depletion of non - 359 muscle myosin II isoforms NMY - 1 and NMY - 2 . Importantly , depletion of myosin II isoform NMY - 360 2 caused intracellular accumulation of recycling endosome marker RME - 1 and recycling cargo 361 hTAC : : GFP similar to sdpn - 1 mutants , while depletion of NMY - 1 did not ( Fig 7 H - J , G ) . By 362 contrast , depletion of myosin II isoform NMY - 1 , but not depletion of NMY - 2 , strongly 363 suppressed sdpn - 1 null mutant intracellular accumulation of GFP : : RME - 1 - labeled recycling 364 endosomes and recycling cargo hTAC : : GFP , similar to the effects of RHO - 1 depletion ( Fig . 7 ) . 365 Taken together these results strongly support a key role for myosin II regulation on endosomes 366 in recycling function , with NMY - 1 as a likely target of SDPN - 1 / PXF - 1 / RAP - 1 / RHO - 1 regulation 367 ( Fig . 8 ) . 368 369 Discussion 370 Syndapin / PACSIN proteins have long been implicated in endocytic recycling in multiple 371 organisms , but a clear understanding of the mechanism of action of these proteins in 372 endosomal regulation has remained unclear ( Braun et al . , 2005 ; Farmer et al . , 2021 ; Gleason et 373 al . , 2016 ) . Some clues are provided by the syndapin / PACSIN domain organization that is 374 characterized by a single N - terminal F - BAR domain that links these proteins to membranes , and 375 a single C - terminal SH3 domain that interacts with other proteins . Our new in vivo data 376 reinforces the essential nature of the SH3 domain to syndapin / PACSIN function in recycling , 377 finding that a point mutation in the SH3 domain of endogenous sdpn - 1 produced endocytic 378 recycling defects in the C . elegans intestine equivalent to those we previously established for 379 sdpn - 1 null mutants . Thus , identifying the key physiologically relevant binding partners of the 380 SDPN - 1 SH3 domain is essential to understanding how SDPN - 1 controls recycling . 381 The C . elegans SH3 - ome project predicted a high likelihood binding site for the SDPN - 1 SH3 in 382 RAP - GEF PXF - 1 , an interaction that we confirmed biochemically . We found the importance of 383 the interaction in vivo to be clear , as mutation of this binding site in endogenous pxf - 1 also 384 severely impaired endocytic recycling , causing intracellular accumulation of intestinal 385 basolateral recycling cargo and abnormal accumulation of markers of early and basolateral 386 recycling endosomes . The role of PXF - 1 in recycling appears to match its known biochemical 387 activity as a Rap - GEF , as our results further showed that loss of PXF - 1 target RAP - 1 also 388 impaired intestinal recycling , and PXF - 1 and RAP - 1 are enriched on SDPN - 1 labeled endosomes 389 as would be expected if they function together . Although Rap GTPases have not been well 390 studied in the context of recycling , mammalian Rap1 and Rap2 have been reported to be 391 enriched on recycling endosomes , with Rap1 supporting recycling of the GABA ( B ) receptor in 392 neurons , and Rap2 supporting recycling of integrin LFA - 1 in T lymphocytes ( 28 , 51 ) . Taken 393 together with our data in C . elegans we conclude that a requirement for Rap - GTPases in 394 endocytic recycling is evolutionarily conserved . Thus , gaining insight into how Rap GTPases are 395 regulated on recycling endosomes , and understanding the mechanisms by which Rap activation 396 influences recycling function in C . elegans should be broadly applicable to other organisms , and 397 has important implications for higher order processes known to require Rap signaling , including 398 cell adhesion , cell migration , cell polarity , and cell fate specification . 399 What then is the function of RAP - 1 signaling from endosomes during recycling ? One known 400 output of Rap signaling is the negative regulation of RhoA , a function first shown during neurite 401 outgrowth , and also prominent during endothelial barrier formation ( 41 , 52 ) . Indeed , we found 402 that C . elegans RHO - 1 / RhoA was highly enriched on early and basolateral recycling endosomes 403 in the adult C . elegans intestine , and RHO - 1 activation was increased upon loss of SDPN - 1 or 404 RAP - 1 as judged by a RHO - 1 ( GTP ) biosensor , indicating that SDPN - 1 and RAP - 1 act as negative 405 regulators of RHO - 1 activity on endosomes . Importantly , our results further revealed RHO - 1 406 negative regulation as a key output of SDPN - 1 signaling relevant to recycling , since a reduction 407 in RHO - 1 levels by RNAi strongly suppressed the recycling defects of sdpn - 1 mutants . We note 408 that recent work in mammalian epithelial cells found cortical recycling endosomes as a major 409 site of RhoA activation , in this case relevant to stress fiber generation and front - rear polarity 410 acquisition , although this work did not test for effects of RhoA activation on recycling function 411 ( 53 ) . These similarities further suggest that our findings will be relevant in a broad context 412 across species . 413 We further sought to determine which output of RHO - 1 signaling was most relevant to SDPN - 1 - 414 mediated recycling regulation . RhoA is a well - established regulator of actomyosin contractility 415 that functions through effectors mDia1 ( a diaphanous - related formin ) and ROCK ( Rho - 416 associated serine / threonine kinase ) , with ROCK activating non - muscle myosin II and actin 417 dynamics ( 48 ) . Our experiments found that depletion of the NMY - 1 isoform of non - muscle 418 myosin II was sufficient to significantly suppress sdpn - 1 mutant defects . These results indicate 419 that inappropriately high levels of active myosin II , or the inability to move through complete 420 myosin contractility cycles , explains at least part of the effects of sdpn - 1 mutants on recycling 421 ( Gleason et al . , 2016 ; Yan et al . , 2021 ) . This interpretation is supported by our results showing 422 that constitutive activation of myosin II by expression of a myosin light chain phosphomimetic 423 also impairs recycling function , and our findings that myosin light chain is enriched on SDPN - 1 424 positive endosomes . 425 Surprisingly , we found the opposite phenotype for non - muscle myosin isoform NMY - 2 . 426 Depletion of NMY - 2 caused intracellular accumulation of recycling cargo , indicating a positive 427 role for NMY - 2 in recycling . Interestingly , previous work on NMY - 1 and NMY - 2 documented 428 opposing effects in the regulation of the contractile ring channels of the C . elegans gonad ( 22 ) . 429 Mathematical modeling in that work suggested that these opposing effects could be explained 430 by NMY - 1 and NMY - 2 contractile fibers exerting forces in opposing directions , one normal to 431 the ring , and the other tangential ( 22 ) . If these principles apply to the recycling endosome case , 432 NMY - 2 derived forces might increase tension on endosomal tubules to promote their fission , 433 while NMY - 1 contraction in an opposing direction might reduce tubule tension and fission . 434 Normal recycling tubule release might require cycles of increased and decreased tension , or 435 forces regulating recycling rates might be modulated in response to changes in cellular 436 requirements , such as changes in cargo load or metabolism . 437 Interestingly , three putative Rho effectors , formin CYK - 1 / mDia , LET - 502 / ROCK , and RTKN - 438 1 / Rhotekin , are known to function in basolateral recycling in the C . elegans intestine , although 439 current models posit that these proteins function independently of RHO - 1 in recycling ( 11 , 54 , 440 55 ) . Branched actin formed by Arp2 / 3 is traditionally considered the relevant F - actin type 441 associated with endosomes , but recycling may require a balance of branched and linear actin 442 for proper function . Actin tracks produced by CYK - 1 could be substrates upon which cycles of 443 myosin II contractility would act , potentially producing cycles of actomyosin - driven endosomal 444 membrane tension that could promote cycles of tubular cargo carrier fission . 445 We note that non - muscle myosin II was previously shown to promote mitochondrial fission and 446 could contribute to endosomal fission during recycling in a similar way ( 56 - 59 ) . Myosin II , 447 Spire1C , and endoplasmic reticulum - bound formin INF2 have been proposed to create 448 actomyosin tension that deforms the outer mitochondrial membrane during “prefission” , 449 promoting curvature - sensing - based recruitment of dynamin - related protein Drp1 and other 450 factors that complete mitochondrial constriction ( 59 ) . Further work will be required to 451 determine if a similar process is operative at the early endosome – recycling endosome 452 interface , and if there is a relationship between SDPN - 1 / RAP - 1 / RHO - 1 / NMY - 1 and previously 453 identified functions for LET - 502 / RTKN - 1 / CYK - 1 during recycling . 454 Syndapin / PACSIN proteins are often thought of as acting directly in endosomal tubule 455 generation or tubule severing , since isolated BAR domains from several of these proteins are 456 able to generate tubules from liposomes in vitro , and in some cases enhance endosomal 457 tubulation when overexpressed in vivo . However , it remains unclear if an F - BAR - driven 458 constricting / tubulating activity is a key output of syndapin / PACSINs that promotes recycling 459 function . An alternate hypothesis is that the key function of the F - BAR domain in 460 syndapin / PACSINs is to provide membrane binding and curvature - sensing that brings 461 syndapin / PACSIN to endosomal tubules elaborated by other means , such as cytoskeletal 462 pushing and pulling forces . In the C . elegans intestine and human HeLa cells RAB - 10 / Rab10 is 463 essential for the extensive tubulation found in the recycling endosome network ( 10 , 60 - 64 ) . In 464 the C . elegans case microfilament and microtubule integrity is required for network structure , 465 and RAB - 10 is known to regulate association of endosomal membranes with actin filaments via 466 the EHBP - 1 protein ( 60 , 63 , 64 ) . In the HeLa case Rab10 - mediated regulation of Kif13 / kinesin 467 pulling forces have also been implicated ( 61 ) . 468 Our new data clearly points to an essential role for Syndapin in signaling via Rap and Rho to 469 control myosin II on endosomes ( Fig . 8 ) , but we cannot rule out an additional mechanical 470 contribution of SDPN - 1 to endosomal function via direct membrane bending . However , the high 471 efficiency of sdpn - 1 mutant recycling phenotype suppression by rho - 1 depletion suggests that 472 RHO - 1 regulation is the main output relevant to recycling . We also note that in some systems 473 syndapin / PACSIN proteins associate with other trafficking regulators such as MICAL - L1 , OCRL1 , 474 Dynamin , and EHD1 / RME - 1 that could promote tubulation and / or severing ( 62 ) . It will be of 475 great interest to revisit the question of relative contributions to the tubule - based recycling 476 mechanism as new genetic and cell biological tools evolve , allowing more complete , acute , and 477 fine - tuned control of experimental conditions , as we further elaborate our understanding of 478 this complex system . 479 480 Acknowledgments 481 We would like to thank the Grant lab for critical comments and suggestions .

Model : SDPN - 1 differentially regulates Non - Muscle Myosins via RAP - 1 to RHO - 1 signaling to regulate endocytic recycling . Recycling tubules pulled from sorting endosomes require non - muscle myosin NMY - 2 , likely for tubule fission . The F - BAR protein SDPN - 1 / Syndapin and its binding partner PXF - 1 activate RAP - 1 / Rap to restrain the level of RHO - 1 / RhoA and non - muscle myosin NMY - 1 activity on the endosome . Such negative regulation is required for successful recycling .
