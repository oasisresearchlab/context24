REVI E W Open Access Global strategies and effectiveness for COVID - 19 prevention through contact tracing , screening , quarantine , and isolation : a systematic review Tadele Girum 1 * , Kifle Lentiro 1 , Mulugeta Geremew 2 , Biru Migora 2 and Sisay Shewamare 3 Abstract Background : COVID - 19 is an emerging disease caused by highly contagious virus called SARS - CoV - 2 . It caused an extensive health and economic burden around the globe . There is no proven effective treatment yet , except certain preventive mechanisms . Some studies assessing the effects of different preventive strategies have been published . However , there is no conclusive evidence . Therefore , this study aimed to review evidences related to COVID - 19 prevention strategies achieved through contact tracing , screening , quarantine , and isolation to determine best practices . Methods : We conducted a systematic review in accordance with the PRISMA and Cochrane guidelines by searching articles from major medical databases such as PubMed / Medline , Global Health Database , Embase , CINAHL , Google Scholar , and clinical trial registries . Non - randomized and modeling articles published to date in areas of COVID prevention with contact tracing , screening , quarantine , and isolation were included . Two experts screened the articles and assessed risk of bias with ROBINS - I tool and certainty of evidence with GRADE approach . The findings were presented narratively and in tabular form . Results : We included 22 ( 9 observational and 13 modeling ) studies . The studies consistently reported the benefit of quarantine , contact tracing , screening , and isolation in different settings . Model estimates indicated that quarantine of exposed people averted 44 to 81 % of incident cases and 31 to 63 % of deaths . Quarantine along with others can also halve the reproductive number and reduce the incidence , thus , shortening the epidemic period effectively . Early initiation of quarantine , operating large - scale screenings , strong contact tracing systems , and isolation of cases can effectively reduce the epidemic . However , adhering only to screening and isolation with lower coverage can miss more than 75 % of asymptomatic cases ; hence , it is not effective . Conclusion : Quarantine , contact tracing , screening , and isolation are effective measures of COVID - 19 prevention , particularly when integrated together . In order to be more effective , quarantine should be implemented early and should cover a larger community .

Tropical Medicine and Health ( 2020 ) 48 : 91 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1186 / s41182 - 020 - 00285 - w Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) is an emerging infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syn - drome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) . The novel corona - virus was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan China , then spread globally within weeks and resulted in an ongoing pandemic [ 1 – 5 ] . Currently , coronavirus is af - fecting 213 countries and territories around the world . As of 27 May 2020 , more than 5 . 7 million cases and 353 , 664 deaths were reported globally [ 2 , 3 ] . Thirteen percent of the closed cohorts and 2 – 5 % of the total cohort reportedly died [ 2 – 5 ] . The USA , Brazil , Russia , Spain , Italy , France , and the UK are the most affected countries [ 3 – 7 ] . The full spectrum of COVID - 19 infection ranges from subclinical self - limiting respiratory tract illness to severe progressive pneumonia with multi - organ failure and death . As evidenced from studies and reports , more than 80 % of cases remained asymptomatic and 15 % of cases appeared as mild cases with common symptoms like fever , cough , fatigue , and loss of smell and taste [ 2 – 6 ] . Severe disease onset that needs intensive care might re - sult in death due to massive alveolar damage and pro - gressive respiratory failure [ 1 , 4 – 8 ] . The virus transmits through direct and indirect con - tacts . Person - to - person transmissions primarily occur during close contact , droplets produced through cough - ing , sneezing , and talking . Indirect transmission occurs through touching contaminated surfaces or objects and then touching the face . It is more contagious during the first few days after the onset of symptoms , but asymp - tomatic cases can also spread the disease [ 5 – 8 ] . Recommended prevention measures was designed based on overcoming the mode of transmissions includ - ing frequent hand washing , maintaining physical dis - tance , quarantine , covering the mouth and nose during coughs , and avoiding contamination of face with un - washed hands . In addition , use of mask is recommended particularly for suspected individuals and their care - givers . There is limited evidence against the community wide use of masks in healthy individuals . However , most of these preventive measures are recommended and were not researched well [ 4 – 8 ] . To the extent of our search , there is no systematic re - view on the preventive aspects and effectiveness of COVID - 19 infection through contact tracing , screening , quarantine , and isolation . The findings were inconclu - sive ; in some studies , certain preventive mechanisms were shown to have minimal effects , while in others dif - ferent preventive mechanisms have better effect than ex - pected . On the other hand , some studies have reported that integration of interventions is more effective than specific interventions [ 2 , 6 , 8 ] . Therefore , we aimed to conduct a comprehensive sys - tematic review through reviewing globally published studies on the strategies and effectiveness of different preventive mechanisms ( contact tracing , screening , quar - antine , and isolation ) developed to prevent and control COVID - 19 . This synthesized measure will be important to bring conclusive evidence , so that policy makers and other stakeholders could have clear evidence to rely on during decision making . Objectives To support the existing local and national COVID - 19 prevention program with tangible evidence , we conducted a systematic review on global strategies for COVID - 19 prevention through contact tracing , screening , quarantine , and isolation . We aimed to answer issues related to alter - native strategic implementation and effectiveness in the prevention of the disease or death . The following key questions were considered : 1 Is contact tracing , screening , quarantine , and isolation effective to control the COVID - 19 outbreak ? 2 Is there difference in the effectiveness of contact tracing , screening , quarantine , and isolation in different settings ? 3 How and when these strategies should be applied to control the COVID - 19 outbreak ? Methods We conducted the review in accordance with the PRIS MA ( Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta - Analyses ) guidance for reporting of systematic reviews and meta - analyses [ 9 ] and the Cochrane Hand - book of Systematic Review [ 10 ] through systematic lit - erature search of articles published to date ( June 02 / 2020 ) containing information on COVID - 19 prevention by contact tracing , screening , quarantine , and isolation . First , a working protocol was developed ( but unpub - lished ) and followed in the process . Eligibility ( inclusion and exclusion ) criteria for the review Based on the relevance of the reported evidence for deci - sion making at local , national , and international levels , the papers were selected and prioritized for the review . The relevant outcomes observed in the review were re - duction in incidence , transmission , adverse outcome , and cost - effectiveness of COVID - 19 prevention through contact tracing , screening , quarantine , and isolation . Types of studies Due to the infancy of the epidemic , lack of researches , and ethical concerns , randomized controlled trials were not included . Therefore , we considered non - randomized observational studies and modeling ( mathematical and / Girum et al . Tropical Medicine and Health ( 2020 ) 48 : 91 Page 2 of 15 or epidemiological ) studies to supplement the existing evidences . We included cohort studies , case - control studies , time series , case series , and mathematical modeling studies conducted anywhere , in any area , and in any setting re - ported in the English language . Whereas , commentaries , letter to editor , case reports , and governmental reports were excluded . Types of participants Depending on the type of the research , for each prevent - ive methods , different participants were included . These includes individuals who have had contacts with con - firmed or suspected case of COVID - 19 , or individuals who lived in areas with COVID - 19 outbreak , or individ - uals considered to be at high risk for COVID - 19 / sus - pected cases or cases of COVID - 19 infection . The number of participants varies according to the individual researches . Individuals who have confirmed other symp - tomatic respiratory diseases were excluded . Types of interventions We included different types of interventions applied spe - cifically or in combination , either voluntary or mandatory and in different settings ( facility or community ) . In com - parative studies , the interventions were compared with the non - applied groups or other comparison groups . We excluded interventions other than the aforementioned strategies . Types of outcome measures To identify the extent to which these interventions were applied globally and to measure their effectiveness in COVID - 19 prevention , we used the following outcome measures : incidence of COVID - 19 , onward transmission , mortality or other adverse outcomes , and cost - effectiveness . We did not address secondary outcomes such as psycho - logical impacts , economic impacts , and social impacts . Literature search strategy A systematic literature search of articles was done by information system professionals and the researchers . Articles published between January 1 , 2020 , and June 2 , 2020 , containing information on different prevention strategies such as contact tracing , screening , quarantine , and isolation , and studies assessing their effectiveness were retained for the review . Electronic bibliographic da - tabases and libraries such as PubMed / Medline , Global Health Database , Embase , CINAHL ( Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature ; Ebsco ) , the Cochrane Library , and African Index Medicus were used . In addition , we searched gray literatures , pre - prints , and resource centers of The Lancet , JAMA , and N Engl J Med . Lastly , we screened the reference lists of systematic reviews for additional source . Combination of the fol - lowing search terms were used with ( AND , OR , NOT ) Boolean ( Search ) Operators . 1 Corona virus 2 Coronavirus Infections 3 SARS COv2 4 COVID - 19 5 Novel corona 6 Prevention / control 7 Contact tracing 8 Screening 9 Quarantine 10 Isolation 11 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 and 6 and 7 or 8 or 9 or 10 Data collection and analysis Study selection process The team screened all the titles and abstracts based on predefined eligibility criteria . Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts and reached consensus by discussion or by involving a third author . After that , the review author team retrieved the full texts of all included abstracts . Two review authors screened all the full - text publications independently , and disagreements were re - solved with consensus or by a third person involvement . Data extraction and management Titles and abstracts found through primary electronic search were thoroughly assessed for the possibility of reporting the intended outcome and filtered for potential eligibility . One of the review authors who have experi - ence extracted data from the included studies into stan - dardized tables , and the second author checked completeness . From each eligible research , the following information was extracted based on the preformed for - mat : author information , title , study participants , study design , study setting , type of intervention , length of intervention , year of publication , study duration , eligibil - ity criteria , rate , and effect of intervention measures . For modeling studies , the data extraction items also included the type of model and the data source . Assessment of risk of bias in included studies Risk of bias was assessed through evaluating reliability and validity of data in included studies based on the Risk - Of - Bias In Non - randomized Studies - of Interven - tions ( ROBINS - I ) tool [ 11 ] . The first author rated the risk of bias , the second author checked the ratings , and the third author was involved in the disagreements . For each studies , the study design , participants , outcome , and presence of bias were assessed based on the eligibil - ity criteria and quality assessment check list . Moreover , Girum et al . Tropical Medicine and Health ( 2020 ) 48 : 91 Page 3 of 15 all studies with the same participants and outcome were measured using the same standard . On the other hand , modeling studies were assessed by the International Society for Pharmaco - economics and Outcomes ( ISPOR ) and the Society for Medical Decision making ( SMDM ) for dynamic mathematical transmission model tools [ 12 ] . Modeling studies that fulfilled all the three criteria were rated as “ no concerns to minor con - cerns , ” and if one or more categories were unclear , it is rated as “ moderate concerns , ” and if one or more categor - ies were not fulfilled , we had it rated as “ major concerns . ” Data synthesis and analysis The qualitative data was systematically reviewed and presented in accordance with the Cochrane guide line . We synthesized results from quantitative measures nar - ratively and reported in tabular form . Because of the het - erogeneity of the primary studies , quantitative analyses ( meta - analysis ) were not conducted . Assessment of the certainty of the evidence By using the GRADE approach [ 13 ] , we graded the cer - tainty of evidence for the main outcomes , reported in standard terms using tables . One of the authors con - ducted the certainty assessment which consists of assess - ments of risk of bias , indirectness , inconsistency , imprecision , and publication bias , and then , classified to one of the four categories : a high certainty ( estimated ef - fect lies close to the true effect ) , a moderate certainty ( estimated effect is probably close to the true effect ) , a low certainty ( estimated effect might substantially differ ) , and very low certainty ( estimated effect is probably markedly different ) from the true effect . Results Studies included The PRISMA flow diagram for the selected studies in the search process and the eligibility assessment are summarized in ( Fig . 1 ) . The initial electronic database search led to 1542 potentially relevant citations in the form of a title , abstract , bibliography , and full - text re - search . After removal of duplicates and initial screening , 125 articles were selected for further evaluation via full - text articles . Of these full - text articles , 103 articles were excluded due to the following reasons : 38 studies re - ported the prevention of SARS other than COVID - 19 ; 36 have measured prevention measures other than con - tact tracing , screening , quarantine , and isolation ; 19 had inappropriate study designs ( commentaries , letters and case reports ) ; and 10 were reviews or protocols . Thus , 22 studies [ 14 – 35 ] met the inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review . Fig . 1 Flow chart for study search , selection , and screening for the review Girum et al . Tropical Medicine and Health ( 2020 ) 48 : 91 Page 4 of 15 Study characteristics The 22 studies [ 14 – 35 ] that were retained for the final ana - lysis were published in the period from January 15 , 2020 , to June 02 , 2020 , based on participant populations in the fol - lowing countries : China ( n = 10 ) , UK ( n = 4 ) , USA ( n = 2 ) , Hong Kong ( n = 2 ) , and Netherlands , Japan , France , and Taiwan ( n = 1 from each ) . The included studies comprised of 9 observational [ 14 – 22 ] and 13 modeling studies [ 23 – 35 ] . With duplicates ( repeated count ) , 3 of the studies assessed the overall prevention strategies [ 21 – 23 ] , 5 assessed the effect of contact tracing [ 14 , 24 , 25 , 33 , 35 ] , 2 assessed screening strategies [ 17 , 34 ] , 12 assessed the effect of quarantine [ 15 , 23 – 31 ] , and 6 assessed the effect of isola - tion [ 17 , 25 , 26 , 31 , 33 , 35 ] . The sample sizes in the studies varied from hundreds to millions . Four studies were investi - gated for effect at the health facility level , while the remaining 18 studies explored at the community or na - tional level . Survey characteristics and summary results are described in Table 1 . Quality ( risk of bias ) assessment within included studies Summaries of the risk of bias assessment of non - randomized studies and quality rating of the modeling studies are presented in Tables 2 and 3 , respectively . Two studies [ 14 , 19 ] have low bias due to confounding , eight studies have low bias in selection of participants into the study , and all studies have low bias in classifica - tion of interventions . The overall risk of bias is moderate for eight studies and serious for one study . On the other hand , we have no concern for nine modeling studies , and two studies have major concerns . COVID - 19 prevention strategies and effectiveness The summary result is presented in Table 1 . Among the nine observational studies , three of them assessed COVID - 19 transmission with the existing prevention measures at a community level in Taiwan , China , and Hong Kong [ 18 – 20 ] . The other two studies assessed the effect of escalating prevention measures at health facil - ities in China and Hong Kong [ 21 , 22 ] , and three studies [ 15 – 17 ] assessed national - and metropolitan - based quar - antine strategies and the effect of laboratory - based quar - antine in the prevention of COVID - 19 . The last study evaluated the effect of community - based contact tracing in UK [ 14 ] . The three studies [ 18 – 20 ] that assessed the overall prevention strategies found out that integration of inter - ventions need to be applied instead of adhering to a sin - gle intervention . Cheng [ 18 ] reported that isolating symptomatic patients alone may not be sufficient enough to contain the epidemic . Wang [ 19 ] and Law [ 20 ] also concluded that in intimate contacts the trans - mission is 40 – 60 % . Preventing contact through different strategies and integration is very important . Studies conducted on the effect of quarantine [ 15 – 17 ] found that it can have a massive preventive effect . One of the studies [ 15 ] that assessed the effect of quarantine in different populations and quarantine strategies found that it should be integrated with input population reduc - tion ( travel restriction ) , and the other study [ 16 ] that assessed the effects of metropolitan - wide quarantine on the Spread of COVID - 19 in China found that quarantine would prevent 79 . 27 % ( 75 . 10 – 83 . 45 % ) of deaths and 87 . 08 % ( 84 . 68 – 89 . 49 % ) of infections . Also , the other re - searcher [ 17 ] evidenced that laboratory - based screenings accomplished within hours can enhance the efficiency of quarantine . Two studies described infection control preparedness measures in health care settings of Hong Kong and China [ 21 , 22 ] . One of these studies [ 21 ] reported that infection transmission is highly increased within a short period of time and multiplicity of infection prevention strategies were recommended for prevention in health care setups . The other study [ 22 ] also concluded that practicing working shift among professionals working in facilities can be used as strategy to prevent thetransmis - sion of COVID infection . A study conducted by Keeling et al . [ 14 ] assessed the ef - ficacy of contact tracing for the containment of COVID - 19 in the UK . The study evaluated the contact pattern of the community and concluded that rapid contact tracing to reduce the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) from 3 . 11 to 0 . 21 enables the outbreak to be contained . Additionally , it was found that each new case requires an average of 36 individuals to be traced , with 8 . 7 % of cases having more than 100 close traceable contacts . In this review , we identified 13 modeling studies [ 23 – 35 ] that assessed the effectiveness of contact tracing , screening , quarantine , and isolation for prevention of COVID - 19 in different settings and groups . The simula - tion was done in individual or group basis and with dif - ferent assumptions . Most of these studies used a model parameter from Chinese reports . Three of these researches [ 25 – 27 ] particularly empha - sized on the way how the R 0 can be reduced and the epi - demic would be reduced . The simulation by Tang et al . [ 25 ] aimed to estimate the R 0 of SARS - CoV - 2 and infer the required effectiveness of isolation and quarantine to contain the outbreak . Their susceptible - exposed - infected - recovered ( SEIR ) model estimated R 0 of 6 . 47 and generalized that 50 % reduction of contact rate achieved by isolation and quaran - tine would decrease the confirmed cases by 44 % ; reducing contacts by 90 % also can decrease the number of cases by 65 % . The other researcher , Rocklov ( 27 ) , by using data from the Diamond Princess Cruise ship , concluded that quaran - tine of passengers prevented 67 % of cases and lowered the R 0 from 14 . 8 to 1 . 78 . Similarly , the reduction of R 0 was achieved from quarantine [ 28 ] . Girum et al .

Tropical Medicine and Health ( 2020 ) 48 : 91 Page 11 of 15 In addition to these , five studies [ 24 , 28 , 30 , 31 , 35 ] which modeled the effectiveness of different public inter - ventions consistently reported that integrated interven - tion is better than a single intervention . One of these research conducted in the UK [ 24 ] found that combined isolation and tracing strategies would reduce transmis - sion more than mass testing or self - isolation alone ( 50 – 60 % compared to 2 – 30 % ) . The other study [ 28 ] also re - ported that with R 0 of 2 . 4 , a combination of case isola - tion and voluntary quarantine for 3 months could prevent 31 % of deaths . The others also concluded that quarantine should be strict and integrated with contact tracing , screening , and other interventions [ 30 , 31 , 35 ] . Five modeling studies also assessed the effect of quarantine [ 23 , 29 , 32 ] , contact tracing [ 33 ] , and screening [ 34 ] . All of the studies [ 23 , 29 , 32 ] reported that quarantine has reduced the incidence of infection and shortened the duration of the epidemic . However , the effectiveness depends on the level of integration with other strategies . Similarly , model simulations that assessed the effect of contact tracing and screening reported that the strategies are effective . However , as the report of Hellewell [ 33 ] stated , contact tracing and isolation might not contain outbreaks of COVID - 19 unless very high levels of contact tracing are achieved . Similarly , the other researcher [ 34 ] reported that in a stable epidemic , under the assumption that 25 % of cases are subclinical , it is estimated that ar - rival screening alone would detect roughly one - third of infected travelers .

Tropical Medicine and Health ( 2020 ) 48 : 91 Page 12 of 15 Discussion This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of contact tra - cing , screening , and quarantine and isolation to prevent COVID - 19 infection by reviewing existing literatures . The review identified and systematically synthesized the find - ings of 22 studies ( 9 observational and 13 modeling stud - ies ) [ 14 – 35 ] to bring the best available evidence that policy makers and implementers can use in the process of infection prevention interventions . The studies consistently reported the benefit of con - tact tracing , screening , quarantine , and isolation in the prevention of COVID - 19 . The effectiveness of quaran - tine in particular is very high . Compared to individuals without any intervention quarantined people exposed to a confirmed case highly averted infections and deaths [ 15 , 23 – 31 ] . Also , the effectiveness of quarantine in - creases whenever it is implemented along with other prevention measures such as isolation , contact tracing , and travel ban [ 23 – 31 ] . Although , screening and contact tracing are very important to control the epidemic , early initiation , larger coverage , and integration with other programs are very important . Unless the level of contact tracing and screening is high , prevention through isola - tion only is very limited , as the screening programs mis - ses 75 % of cases [ 3 , 24 ] . Quarantine measures applied alone or integrated with other measures were reported to be the most effective measures [ 25 – 31 ] . However , integration of quarantine with other public health measures increases the effective - ness and efficiency of the program [ 36 ] . Implementation of early quarantine measures makes the strategy a more cost effective one [ 28 , 30 ] . Quarantine implemented as self - quarantine and group quarantine is effective at vary - ing levels once effectively implemented [ 28 , 32 ] . Total lockdown measures enhance the effectiveness of quaran - tine measures [ 15 – 19 ] . When laboratory tests are very fast , laboratory - based quarantine could be an effective in health care setups [ 17 ] . This evidence is in line with the finding of other re - views and modeling studies conducted to assess the ef - fectiveness of these measures in the prevention of SARS , MERS , and COVID - 19 [ 28 , 35 – 37 ] . As reported before , combination of case isolation and voluntary quarantine for 3 months could prevent 31 % of deaths compared to any single intervention . And adding social distancing on the previous interventions on people aged 70 years or older for 4 months increases the prevention proportion of deaths to 49 % . It can also reduce the reproductive number by half ; hence , it can tremendously reduce the incidence of infection , reduce the period of epidemic , and enhance effectiveness of control [ 28 , 36 ] . Our findings also witnessed the effectiveness of con - tact tracing measures used for pandemic response efforts at multiple levels of health care systems . Isolation of sus - pected and confirmed patients and their contact is at the heart of the prevention strategy . However , for the con - tact tracing to be an effective measure , it has to be inte - grated with other measures such as quarantine and screening . Because larger shares of individuals are asymptomatic , contact tracing may be difficult in areas where contact recording is unachievable . According to world health organization , contact tracing is also one of the most essential and effective strategies to control the epidemic [ 14 , 24 , 25 , 33 , 35 ] .

Tropical Medicine and Health ( 2020 ) 48 : 91 Page 13 of 15 evidenced the importance of contact tracing and isola - tion in different settings [ 36 , 37 ] . The finding of our review revealed that screening and isolation are important measures of disease prevention [ 17 , 25 , 26 , 31 , 33 , 35 ] . Most of the researches recom - mend high - risk group screening and contact cases screening in a resource - limited setting . However , these programs are effective when the screening capacity is higher and contact tracing is effective . Otherwise , screen - ing and isolation programs miss more than half of cases and may not be implemented alone [ 25 , 33 , 35 ] . Also evi - dences from different countries indicated that screening and isolation measures are implemented along with other measures , yet their role in the prevention of the epidemic is high [ 2 , 3 , 8 , 36 , 37 ] . Limitation This review included a wide variety of study designs ( ob - servational and model studies ) ; hence , it failed to include meta - analysis ( statistical measures ) . Modeled studies also assume different scenarios , where it may not be true in the general cases . Also , the review has included only publications reported in the English language and open access resources . Conclusion and recommendation Quarantine , contact tracing , screening , and isolation are effective measures of COVID - 19 prevention , particularly whenever integrated together . In order to be more ef - fective , quarantine should be implemented early and covers larger community . Controlling population travel will enhance the effectiveness of quarantine . Screening , contact tracing , and isolation are effective particularly in areas where contact tracing is easily attainable . Although screening is the effective measure recommended by the WHO , since the disease is asymptomatic , it may miss a larger share of the population . Therefore , this should be integrated with other preventive measures . In order to control the COVID - 19 epidemic , the health care system should consider high level of contact tracing , early initi - ation of nationwide quarantine measures , increasing coverage of screening service , and preparing effective isolation centers .
