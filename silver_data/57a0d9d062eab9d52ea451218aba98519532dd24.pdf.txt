T his transport occurs by means of vesicular intermediates that bud from a donor compartment and fuse with an acceptor compartment . Vesicle budding and cargo selection are mediated by protein coats , while vesicle targeting and fusion depend on a machinery that includes the SNARE proteins . Precise regulation of these two aspects of vesicular transport ensures efficient cargo transfer while preserving organelle identity . Loading . . .
