Despite the abundance of α - helical structures among the human proteome and their undisputed importance in health and disease , the fundamental principles of their behavior under mechanical load are poorly understood . Talin and α - catenin are two key mol - ecules in focal adhesions and adherens junctions , respectively . In this study , we used a combination of atomistic steered molecular dynamics ( SMD ) simulations , polyprotein engi - neering , and single - molecule atomic force microscopy ( smAFM ) to investigate unfolding of these proteins . SMD simulations revealed that talin rod α - helix bundles as well as α - catenin α - helix domains unfold through stable 3 - helix intermediates . While the 5 - helix bundles were found to be mechanically stable , a second stable conformation corresponding to the 3 - helix state was revealed . Mechanically weaker 4 - helix bundles easily unfolded into a stable 3 - helix conformation . The results of smAFM experiments were in agreement with the findings of the computational simulations . The disulfide clamp mutants , designed to protect the sta - ble state , support the 3 - helix intermediate model in both experimental and computational setups . As a result , multiple discrete unfolding intermediate states in the talin and α - catenin unfolding pathway were discovered . Better understanding of the mechanical unfolding mechanism of α - helix proteins is a key step towards comprehensive models describing the mechanoregulation of proteins . Author summary In order to migrate and survive , most cells need to be attached to their environment . Cells anchor to the extracellular matrix via transmembrane integrin , connecting it to contractile the cytoskeleton . Similarly , cell - cell contacts are formed via transmembrane cadherin , which also connects to the contractile cytoskeleton through scaffolding proteins . Exam - ples of such proteins include talin and α - catenin , which connect integrin and cadherin respectively , to actin filaments of the cytoskeleton . Mechanical forces that are transmitted between the cell and its environment activate binding and regulate the functions of these PLOS Computational Biology | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pcbi . 1006126 April 26 , 2018 1 / 19 a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111a1111111111 OPEN ACCESS Citation : MykuliakVV , Haining AWM , von Essen M , del Rı´o Herna´ndezA , Hyto¨nen VP ( 2018 ) Mechanical unfoldingreveals stable 3 - helix intermediates in talin and α - catenin .

The stretching of these proteins under mechanical load exposes buried binding sites for other partners , such as vinculin . We used steered molecular dynamics simulations and single - molecule atomic force microscopy to study how these proteins unfold under load . Our results suggest that α - helical talin and α - catenin unfold through stable 3 - helix intermediates . These intermedi - ates represent biologically active states , which may allow recruitment of other binding partners . Introduction Protein activity can be modulated by mechanical cues in addition to chemical stimuli and ligand binding . Mechanical forces can induce conformational changes in the protein structure , that leads to either a switch between the functional states of the protein , or allows for multiple functions [ 1 , 2 ] . α - helix folds are highly abundant among the structural proteins located at the cell - cell and cell - ECM contacts [ 3 – 5 ] , among the essential muscle costamere complexes [ 6 ] , as well as among the structures interconnecting the cytoskeleton [ 7 , 8 ] and cellular organelles [ 9 ] . Despite the numerous studies on mechanotransduction and the mechanosensitivity of proteins , the mechanisms associated with forced protein unfolding and mechanosignaling are not well understood especially where α - helical proteins are concerned . One reason for such a lack of understanding might be that α - helices are , in general , mechanically weaker compared to β - strand folds [ 10 ] and are therefore challenging to study experimentally . The low mechanical stability of α - helical proteins requires sophisticated experimental methods capable of force measurement in the range of piconewtons [ 11 ] . Among the α - helical structural proteins , several distinct folds have been identified . Talin - like proteins contain 5 - and 4 - helix bundles [ 12 ] . Proteins of the catenin family contain a 4 - helix conformation with long α - helices interconnecting two bundles [ 13 ] . Both of these multi - helical protein folds respond to mechanical load by a dissociation of the bundles leading to mechanoregulatory function . The spectrin fold is formed of a 3 - helix conformation with a long α - helix connecting the neighboring domains , forming a rigid rod of interacting 3 - helix bundles . The spectrin - like conformation accounts for structural reinforcement in the cellular scaffolds [ 3 , 4 , 7 ] . Finally , single long α - helices and coils can also be found among structural α - helical proteins ( PDB id 5KHT ) . Focal adhesions and adherens junctions are fundamental mechanosensitive structures through which cells communicate with the extracellular matrix and with their adjacent cells , respectively . The processes of focal adhesion formation and maturation are regulated by mechani - cal signals [ 14 , 15 ] . Similar to the role of focal adhesions in the cell - ECM connection , adherens junctions are essential for cell - cell contacts . Adherens junctions are associated with the cadherin super - family of transmembrane proteins , which are connected through catenin - rich protein com - plexes to the actin cytoskeleton . The cadherins bind to the cytoplasmic protein β - catenin , which in turn binds to the filamentous F - actin binding adaptor protein , α - catenin [ 16 , 17 ] . Talin is a large focal adhesion protein that contains an N - terminal head domain , which is responsible for integrin binding . The larger talin rod domain consists of amphipathic α - helices arranged into 13 four or five - helix bundles ( R1 – R13 ) and a single helix dimerization domain ( DD ) at the C - terminal end ( Fig 1A ) . Talin provides a link between the ECM , via the talin head - integrin interaction , and the cytoskeleton through the binding of actin filaments at actin 3 - helix intermediates in talin and α - catenin PLOS Computational Biology | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pcbi . 1006126 April 26 , 2018 2 / 19 for Science , Finland ( https : / / www . csc . fi / ) , for computational resources .

Furthermore , the talin rod comprises up to 11 buried vinculin binding sites ( VBSs ) , distributed along its structure . These binding sites are exposed by partial or complete unfolding of different bundles [ 18 , 19 ] as a result of mechanical stretch - ing . In this way mechanical load regulates talin function by exposing the buried binding sites for certain binding partners such as vinculin [ 20 ] , while simultaneously , epitopes for other binding partners become inactivated . An example of such epitope inactivation would be the talin binding partner RIAM which binds only to folded talin domains [ 21 ] . Thus , conforma - tional changes of talin under mechanical load regulate the recruitment and activation of talin - interacting proteins . Interestingly , talin dimerization is also regulated by mechanical force [ 22 ] . This property highlights talin as a key player in the transmission and sensing of mechani - cal signals between the extracellular matrix and cell cytoskeleton . These mechanical signals are central for a variety of cellular functions including spreading , migration , invasion and sub - strate sensing [ 23 – 25 ] . Similar to talin , α - catenin recruits vinculin , providing the mechanical connection between cell - cell adhesions and the cytoskeleton . α - catenin contains 5 α - helix domains : the Fig 1 . α - helix bundle mechanical stability .

Vin - culin binds the M I domain of α - catenin while the two adjacent domains ( M II and M III ) inhibit vinculin binding to M I . It has been demonstrated that vinculin is recruited in a force - depen - dent manner to the cadherin / catenin complex upon force - dependent unfolding of α - catenin . This process resembles the binding of vinculin to the talin rod domain upon tension - depen - dent unfolding . This tension - dependent unfolding is thought to be central in cell - cell adhesion mechanosensing [ 9 , 26 , 27 ] . It has been previously hypothesized that the force - dependent unfolding of the vinculin binding domains of the talin rod and the α - catenin domains includes stable intermediate con - formations [ 28 – 30 ] . However , this has never been previously studied in detail in computational simulation or in experimental setup suitable for analysis of single - molecule unfolding events . α - helical proteins are associated with key physiological and pathological processes in mechan - obiology [ 31 – 33 ] . A number of diverse diseases from heart [ 34 ] and muscle [ 35 ] , diseases of bone , vascular and nervous system , or skin [ 36 ] have been associated with mechanobiology . Hence , better understanding of their unfolding characteristics will open the possibility of answering a plethora of questions in biology and medicine . In this study , we investigate the molecular mechanisms of the unfolding of two α - helical proteins , talin and α - catenin , on an atomistic level by a combination of steered molecular dynamics ( SMD ) simulations and sin - gle - molecule atomic force microscopy ( smAFM ) . This study elaborates in closer detail on observations made during our previous work described in Haining et al . [ 28 ] . Previously , we have concentrated on the mechanical sensitivity of the talin rod subdomains during the initial domain breaking . We have reported that the talin subdomains are similar , however not identical in their ability to withstand mechanical load . All the tested talin subdomains unfolded in AFM setup over a range of mechanical forces between 10 and 40 pN . During the SMD simulations we repeatedly observed a possible unfold - ing intermediate in the unfolding trajectories which we intended to investigate further . There - fore , in the light of our previous findings , we have now selected two talin subdomains on either end of the mechanical sensitivity scale for the current study ; weak R3 and strong R9 . Talin R9 is an exceptional subdomain responsible for talin autoinhibition while it does not contain VBS . For that reason , we have also included subdomain R11 to investigate the unfold - ing intermediate in the terms of VBS activation . Results In order to probe the existence of stable intermediates in the unfolding trajectory of α - helical mechanosensitive domains , we have selected two mechanoregulatory proteins , talin and α - catenin ( Fig 1 ) . We have selected the mechanically stronger talin 5 - helix bundles R9 and R11 , and the mechanically weaker 4 - helix bundles of talin R3 and α - catenin modulation domains I to II ( M I - M II ) . Constant velocity pulling simulations reveal that talin rod bundles unfold through stable 3 - helix intermediates We subjected two talin rod 5 - helix bundles , R9 and R11 , to end - to - end SMD stretching with constant velocity pulling simulation at 2 nm / ns . Previously , talin 5 - helix bundles were more mechanically stable in our SMD simulations compared to 4 - helix bundles . According to our previous study [ 28 ] , R9 was one of the strongest rod bundles . Overall , unfolding of R9 and R11 showed two force peaks ( Fig 2A ) , which correspond to breaking of the 5 - helix bundle and 3 - helix intermediate . This unfolding intermediate consists of core helices ( H2 – H4 ) after the 3 - helix intermediates in talin and α - catenin PLOS Computational Biology | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pcbi . 1006126 April 26 , 2018 4 / 19 dissociation of H1 and H5 . For R9 the maximum unfolding forces detected in constant velocity pulling simulation at 2 nm / ns were 348 ± 24 pN and 349 ± 39 pN ( average force ± standard deviation ) . Unfolding peak forces for R11 were very similar to those for R9 ( Fig 2A ) . Represen - tative snapshots of the unfolding trajectories are shown in Fig 3 , indicating changing of the bundle conformation during unfolding . Fig 2 . Unfolding force profiles of the studied protein constructs in constant velocity SMD . ( a ) Unfolding forces for 5 - helix talin rod R9 and R11 have similar profiles and show two peaks , which correspond to breaking of 5 - helix and 3 - helix state respectively . ( b ) R9 constructs with disulphide clamps have similar force profiles to wild - type R9 , but unfolding of 3 - helix state was blocked . Tandem constructs for ( c & d ) R9 and ( f ) α - catenin ( M I - M II ) were unfolded through 3 - helix state for both monomers simultaneously . ( c ) R9 ( wt ) – R9 ( wt ) tandem showed four peaks , corresponding to breaking of the 5h & 5h ! 3h ( peak I ) , 5h ! 3h & 3h ( peak II ) , 3h & 3h ! 0h ( peak III ) , and 3h ! 0h & 0h ( peak IV ) respectively .

These clamped R9 mutants were subjected to end - to - end pulling in simulation and experimental setup . We pre - pared three constructs including L1698C and A1748C cysteine mutations that protect 3 - helix core from N - terminus ( N clamp ) , A1720C and A1779C mutations that prevent unfolding of the 3 - helix core from C - terminus ( C clamp ) , and R9 construct with both N - and C - terminal disul - fide clamps ( N / C clamps ) ( S1 Fig ) . All R9 clamp mutants showed very similar unfolding of 5 - helix state compared to the wild - type R9 ( Fig 2B ) . The unfolding of the 3 - helix state was effec - tively blocked in the R9 equipped with N / C clamps , while the constructs with only one disulfide clamp allowed unfolding of either H2 ( R9 with C clamp ) or H4 ( R9 with N clamp ) of the 3 - helix core , but did not compromise the stability of the 3 - helix intermediate ( Fig 2B ) . In additional experiments , we investigated talin R3 bundle and α - catenin modulation domains I to II ( M I - M II ) , which are all 4 - helix bundles . Talin R3 was easily unfolded to the 3 - helix state by the separation of H4 . The 3 - helix intermediate ( H1 – H3 ) was more stable Fig 3 . Representative structure snapshots from SMD .

Similarly , α - catenin was unfolded to 3 - helix conformation by dissocia - tion of H4 ( four out of five simulations ) in M II and H1 in M I ( all five simulations ) . Further unfolding showed two force peaks for breaking the 3 - helix state in M II ( at 349 ± 33 pN ) and M I ( at 461 ± 68 pN ) ( Fig 2F ) . Collectively these data suggest that both 4 - and 5 - helix bundles unfold through stable 3 - helix intermediate state . Furthermore , 5 - helix bundles withstand mechanical load better than 4 - helix domains , which are easily unfolded to the 3 - helix state . Described constant velocity SMD simulations of individual talin rod bundles and α - catenin were run five times each . Unfolding force profiles showed that our results are well reproducible ( S2 Fig ) and allowed us to calculate average peak force and a standard deviation ( S1 Table ) . Talin tandem domain experiments confirm the existence of 3 - helix intermediates To assess the effects of force penetration on the unfolding mechanisms in SMD simulations , we studied the unfolding mechanisms and the existence of the stable intermediates in linear protein chain consisting of two talin R9 monomers resembling the natural biological assembly of talin . We designed tandem construct possessing exactly the same mechanical stability , i . e . two talin R9 domains ( R9 WT −R9 WT tandem ) . Furthermore , we analyzed the R9 tandems with disulfide clamps , protecting the 3 - helix core from unfolding , in either first or second mono - mer , with respect to the fixed N - terminal and pulled C - terminal end . Thus , we prepared two tandem constructs with clamps , R9 N / C clamps −R9 WT and R9 WT −R9 N / C clamps , respectively . For R9 WT −R9 WT tandem , unfolding force showed four peaks , corresponding to the breaking of 5 - helix states first , followed by dissociation of the 3 - helix states in both α - helix bundles ( Fig 2C ) . Because the pulling was applied to C α atom of C - terminal residue , the second R9 in the tandem was closest to the point of pulling and unfolded to 3 - helix state first . Both monomers of the R9 WT −R9 WT tandem unfolded to the 3 - helix intermediate within approx . 30 ns of the SMD simulation with 2 nm / ns pulling velocity , and unfolded at approx . 50 ns . Both tandems containing one clamped monomer showed three unfolding force peaks ( Fig 2D ) lacking the peak corresponding to the breaking of the disulfide - clamped 3 - helix structure . Indeed , the force penetration did affect the two different tandems with clamps resulting in different unfolding trajectories . For R9 WT −R9 N / C clamps tandem , both monomers had 3 - helix conforma - tions at ~ 30 ns , while for R9 N / C clamps −R9 WT , closest to the point of pulling monomer ( R9 WT ) unfolded completely before R9 N / C clamps molecule unfolded to 3 - helix state ( Fig 2D , Fig 3 ) . The investigation of the unfolding of a tandem provided us with a tool of studying the unfolding principles of multiple domains . Furthermore , the use of disulfide clamps in the tan - dem construct protecting the stable state provided us with a comparison force trace and addi - tional proof of an intermediate unfolding conformation in both mechanosensitive proteins . Altogether , these findings indicate that the unfolding force required for the unfolding of the 3 - helix intermediate state is similar to that needed for the unfolding of 5 - helix state . smAFM analysis of α - helical bundles confirms unfolding through intermediate states consistent with 3 - helix pattern shown by SMD We utilized smAFM to characterize the unfolding patterns of R9 and R11 constructs and cap - tured the 3 - helix intermediate ( Fig 4 ) . Similarly to the SMD , we detected two unfolding events for each of the bundles , implying that unfolding occurs through a mechanically stable interme - diate . Overall the bundle stability was higher in the case of R9 than R11 , consistent with our previous results [ 28 ] . The distance between the two unfolding events is 20 – 25 nm , which is consistent with the collapse from 5 helices to 3 helices . Likewise , the distance from the second 3 - helix intermediates in talin and α - catenin PLOS Computational Biology | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pcbi . 1006126 April 26 , 2018 7 / 19 unfolding event to the HaloTag ruler of 25 – 35 nm is consistent with the subsequent collapse of the 3 - helix intermediate . As such the smAFM data supports the picture derived from the SMD analysis : 5 - helix bundles collapse via a stable 3 - helix intermediate . We also tested the R9 tandem construct to examine if the 3 - helix intermediate could be detectable within a model of a polyprotein ( Fig 5A – 5D ) . We detected 4 unfolding events , con - sistent with a pattern of two bundles unfolding via a stable intermediate . The distances between the first and second event ( ~ 20 nm ) , second and third ( ~ 30 nm ) , third and fourth ( ~ 20 nm ) and fourth and HaloTag ( ~ 30 nm ) imply that , contrary to the SMD results , one α - helix bundle collapsed completely through a 3 - helix intermediate before the second α - helix domain started unfolding . However , it is difficult to be certain , given the error margin of the peak locations and the likely stochastic nature of the unfolding process . When the 3 - helix disulfide clamp was introduced into one of the tandem R9 domains , we saw a reduction in the number of unfolding events from 4 to 3 ( Fig 5E – 5H ) . This , along with the reduction of the overall unfolding length from 105 nm to 85 nm , demonstrates that the disulfide clamping was able to protect the 3 - helix intermediate of the R9 from mechanical unfolding . The forced unfolding of α - catenin modulation domains I to II ( M I - M II ) by AFM produced a pattern consistent with the SMD simulation ( Fig 5I – 5L ) . We detected two unfolding events with a maximum unfolding length of ~ 50 nm which implies that there is no unfolding event with respect to the reduction of both 4 - helix bundles into 3 - helix states . This is in agreement with herein presented SMD data and with our previous work reporting on the lower mechani - cal stability of the 4 - helix bundles [ 28 ] . The two events observed with unfolding lengths of ~ 25 nm correspond to the mechanical unfolding of 3 - helix intermediate states . Constant force SMD confirms the existence of 3 - helix intermediates in talin rod R3 and R9 For the comparison of the 3 - helix state mechanical stability we selected two mechanically diverse talin rod bundles , i . e . the mechanically weaker R3 and the mechanically stronger R9 Fig 4 .

Although constant velocity SMD simulations are an excellent tool comparing the results with AFM analysis , they are less sensitive for the assessment of interme - diate states as compared to constant force simulations . Therefore , we subjected the R3 and R9 bundles to constant force pulling simulations where , after screening of suitable force regime , constant force ranging from 160 pN to 200 pN for R3 , and from 200 pN to 300 pN for R9 ( Fig 6 ) was used . In constant force SMD , 4 - helix R3 was weak even at 160 pN and rapidly unfolded to 3 - helix state ( within ~ 3 ns ) . After the separation of H4 , H3 was slowly sliding relative to H1 and H2 ( from ~ 3 ns to ~ 23 ns ) . The 3 - helix intermediate did not unfold at 160 pN in 40 ns time window ( Fig 6A ) , however , it unfolded completely ( at ~ 72 ns ) in extended 160 pN simu - lation ( S3A Fig ) . R3 was extended also with constant force at 170 pN , 180 pN and 200 pN . Fig 5 . Unfolding patterns of tandem α - helical bundles as determined by smAFM .

For strong R9 bundle , we first applied constant force of 200 pN and observed only partial uncoiling of terminal helices ( H1 and H5 ) within 40 ns time window ( Fig 6B ) , yet the 5 - helix state remained intact . However , R9 unfolded to the 3 - helix state ( at ~ 86 ns ) in extended 200 pN simulation ( S3B Fig ) . The applica - tion of constant force of 220 pN or higher resulted in gradual unfolding of the bundle . During the unfolding , we recognized two stable states ( 5 - helix and 3 - helix states ) . In order to compare mechanical stability of 5 - and 3 - helix states , we used the disrupted 5 - helix state of R9 and sub - jected it to stretching with constant force of 200 pN . Although 3 - helix intermediate was rela - tively stable , it slowly unfolded over time under 200 pN while 5 - helix bundle resisted the unfolding under the same force magnitude . Fig 6 .

However , it is weaker as compared to the 5 - helix state of R9 . In more detail , the 3 - helix state can be unfolded under lower force load once the 5 - helix state of the R9 bundle is broken . On the other hand , the 3 - helix intermediate state in R3 is the most stable conformation of the R3 bundle . Discussion Numerous studies concerning α - helical mechanosensitive proteins have provided information on mechanically regulated switches between diverse binding partners and their associated functions . Perhaps one of the best known examples of this mechanoregulated protein - protein interaction is the tandem talin - vinculin , where mechanical stress applied to talin rod exposes binding sites for vinculin [ 37 , 38 ] . Our observation of SMD trajectories for talin multidomain constructs , described in our previous work [ 28 ] , revealed a possible stable 3 - helix intermediate during the forced domain unfolding . Because of the complexity of the SMD and smAFM data we obtained during the multidomain construct unfolding , we were not able to identify previously the 3 - helix interme - diate among the force traces directly . However , simultaneous domain unfolding was recog - nized for bundles of similar mechanostability in smAFM [ 28 ] . In this study , we investigated the detailed unfolding mechanisms of α - helical talin rod bundles and α - catenin M I - M II domains to probe the presence of any intermediate or partial unfolded states . Our results show that the two studied proteins unfold through a stable 3 - helix intermediate . Constant velocity pulling used in SMD and smAFM revealed , that the unfolding force profiles for the 5 - helix rod bundles R9 and R11 have two peaks , which correspond to the breaking of the 5 - and 3 - helix states ( Fig 2A ) . The talin 4 - helix bundle R3 and α - catenin bundles M I - M II also unfolded through stable 3 - helix intermediates ( Fig 2E and 2F ) . In addition , this 3 - helix state was recognized as the most mechanically stable conformation for the 4 - helix domains ( Fig 6A ) . Other studies have also provided indirect evidence of unfolding intermediates in alpha heli - cal proteins . Investigations of the talin R3 subdomain have revealed a possible 3 - helix interme - diate capable of rapid or instant activation for vinculin binding . Specifically , the deletion of helix 4 of rod subdomain R3 ( Δ R3H4 ) leads to super - active R3 localizing efficiently in cell - ECM contacts ( S6 Fig ) . Rahikainen et al . , 2017 [ 23 ] showed that one or two destabilizing mu - tations in R3 H1 were sufficient to facilitate bundle unfolding , increasing the activation of vin - culin binding and resulting in a strong cellular phenotype . The phenotype of the further destabilized state modified with four mutations was comparable to the super - active R3 poten - tially indicating a 3 - helix intermediate . Further evidence of a 3 - helix state in R3 domain is found in a recent study by Baxter et al . [ 39 ] . A 3 - helix open state has been recognized after the dissociation of H1 from the R3 bundle under high pressure conditions . Similar effects were observed even for the talin R1 bundle , where the deletion of H5 resulted in the exposure of the VBS located in H4 and an active conformation of R1 [ 40 ] . The authors also suggest that the deletion of H5 , resulting in a 4 - helix partial bundle , causes a destabilization of the R1 domain leading to partial unfolding . This observation is in line with our results ; we showed that the 4 - helix fold is a fragile conformation which does not require excessive mechanical force to unfold to a stable 3 - helix state ( Fig 2E ) . Finally , even previous computational studies suggested that only partial unfolding of talin subdomains described by minimal protein extension is suf - ficient for VBS activation . In more detail , R1 VBS was activated through torsional conforma - tional change of the hydrophobic core orientation within R1 subdomain during an extension of less than 2 Å [ 41 ] . Inspection of the molecular characteristics of 5 - ( 4 - in R3 ) and 3 - helix states did not reveal any dominant differences between these assemblies in terms of interactions or packing . The 3 - helix intermediates in talin and α - catenin PLOS Computational Biology | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pcbi . 1006126 April 26 , 2018 11 / 19 hydrophobic interactions appear to be the main factor in maintaining both these states , as shown in S4 Fig . In the previous study [ 28 ] , we proposed two conserved residues that are important for maintaining R9 5 - helix bundle stability , namely Leu1668 in H1 and Met1803 in H5 . Further studies including experimental investigation of subdomains carrying mutations targeting the 3 - helix core fragment would be needed to evaluate the contributions of individual residues for the mechanical stability of the 3 - helix intermediate state . Further unfolding of the 3 - helix intermediate was observed in our experimental and simu - lation setup . Whether the complete unfolding of an α - helical domain takes place in vivo , or whether the 3 - helix state is the final unfolding conformation remains unclear . Hints of both of these options can be found in the literature . As discussed earlier [ 40 ] , S6 Fig , the deletion of ter - minal helix in R1 and R3 is sufficient for VBS activation and vinculin recruitment . Thus , we speculate that the 3 - helix state is capable of vinculin binding . Vinculin binding to unfolded talin or α - catenin domains inhibits domain refolding under low mechanical load [ 20 , 27 , 42 ] . Simultaneously , vinculin binding to the 3 - helix state bundle may protect it from complete unfolding [ 43 ] . Studies by Margadant et al . [ 43 ] show that the maximal length of talin is approx . 400 nm in living cells . This also supports the notion of partial unfolding even in the absence of vinculin . Interestingly , recently published work by Ringer et al . [ 11 ] revealed a force gradient across the talin rod domain . In the presence of vinculin , greater force was measured at the N - terminal end than at the C terminal end resulting in the bundle unfolding and activation for vinculin binding . As vinculin binds to activated talin and to actin , the force acting on the talin rod is divided and reduced towards the C - terminal end . We speculate that the reduced force might be insufficient to unfold the stable 5 - helix subdomains located at the C - terminal end of the talin rod . However , here we showed that the intermediate resulting from 4 - helix unfolding was mechanically weaker compared to the intermediate of a 5 - helix bundle . Thus , the com - plete unfolding of 4 - helix bundles at the N - terminal end of the talin rod may be possible . Based on the work by Yao et al . , we may assume that complete yet reversible unfolding of R3 domain takes place under low force load . It was shown than under 4 . 8 pN of constant force load exerted on the full length talin , R3 occupies two distinct conformations with elongation of approx . 19 nm . However , which states these in fact are remains unclear [ 44 ] . We may hypothesize that only the end - to - end attachment to the pulling device and initial elongation under low force load is sufficient to collapse R3 into an activated 3 - helix state . Such immediate conformational change would not necessarily result into an observable difference in the total end - to - end elongation compared to the R3 conformation in solution ( S5 Fig ) [ 41 ] . Similar elongation of approx . 19 nm between the 3 - helix intermediate and the completely unfolded state was shown in our SMD results ( Fig 6A ) . Here we also see that the 3 - helix intermediate remained stable even though the end - to - end distance increased by 5 nm . This distance increase was caused by the uncoiling of H4 . Based on our observations of the talin unfolding mechanisms , we propose a model of multi - domain α - helical protein unfolding under mechanical load , shown in Fig 7 . In the absence of mechanical force , α - helical bundles remain in a folded conformation , capable of binding their ligands such as RIAM ( R2 , R3 , R8 and R11 ) and DLC1 ( R8 ) in the case of talin [ 45 ] . At low mechanical load , soft α - helix bundles , namely 4 - helix domains , unfold to stable 3 - helix inter - mediates . Since the activation of vinculin binding sites ( VBSs ) requires the unfolding of talin bundles [ 14 ] , the formation of 3 - helix states suggests that VBSs located at the terminal helices become available for vinculin . At the same time , the partial unfolding of the bundles leads to a disturbance of the binding sites for other binding partners located on the bundle surface , which abrogates their interaction [ 21 ] . With increasing force , additional bundles collapse to a 3 - helix conformation switching from the mechanoregulatory role to a structural reinforcement role , similar to that of spectrin . In other words , it is possible that talin reacts to a range of small 3 - helix intermediates in talin and α - catenin PLOS Computational Biology | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pcbi . 1006126 April 26 , 2018 12 / 19 mechanical forces by the dissociation of certain bundles leading to a change in binding to other proteins . Such mechanoregulation would take place until the bundles reach a stable 3 - helix spectrin - like conformation . At this point , the talin protein would assume a structural reinforcement role . Finally , at a high force , completely unfolded bundles would lose the ability to support ligand binding as well as structural function [ 20 ] . Such a model enables rich mechanosignaling through talin . A recent study by the Barsukov group has proposed the talin protein as being a hub for several different binding partners [ 45 ] where the proposed 3 - helix intermediate state could be an essential component of binding regulation . Moreover , it has been recently shown , that the mechanical load across talin is not homogeneous , providing fur - ther variation in the regulation of talin functions [ 11 ] . Since the talin rod experiences a force gradient , once vinculin is bound , the local stress may become modulated and insufficient to unfold the 3 - helix state . The 3 - helix state may thus represent abundant talin rod subdomain conformation in living cells [ 11 , 43 ] . Experimental work is essential to confirm and refine these models . While the activation of talin binding sites by mechanical force has been long studied , the detailed mechanism of the forced unfolding has not been previously discussed . The existence of a stable 3 - helix intermediate may offer yet another level in the mechanoregulation process and in the cell’s response to mechanical stimuli . The existence of the unfolding intermediate also adds additional complexity to the assessment of the impact of mutations in the case of dis - eases . α - catenin truncating mutations have been detected in patients with hereditary gastric cancer [ 46 ] possibly increasing the disease susceptibility . Furthermore , α - catenin mutations have been directly associated with macular dystrophy [ 47 ] . The understanding of molecular mechanisms would shed light on the disease development and guide new treatment solutions . We may also speculate that the existence of a 3 - helix intermediate , whether undergoing full unfolding or not , may provide an additional structural support . It is also possible that the 3 - helix state functions as a molecular bumper reducing the impact of functional mutations present in the mechanosensitive protein . In other words , with additional level of mechanore - gulation , the mutation effect on the cells behavior may be defused with only moderate effect on the cells fitness . Such a theory may be of importance in the case of talin which has been pre - sented as a vital protein in cell and tissue biology . Yet , despite its important roles , only one Fig 7 . Schematic representation of talin rod unfolding through stable 3 - helix intermediates . Without force , the talin rod subdomains remain intact and no VBSs are exposed . Under low load weak 4 - helix bundles unfold to stable 3 - helix intermediates . As the force increases , some of the 5 - helix bundles unfold , forming the 3 - helix intermediates along talin rod structure . Force - regulated unfolding of the talin rod changes affinity to different binding partners . RIAM and DLC1 are known to bind folded bundles , while recruitment of vinculin requires partial or complete unfolding of rod domains . VBSs that are located at terminal helices of the R2 , R6 , R7 , and R10 bundles become available after unfolding to the 3 - helix state ( panel “Low force” ) . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pcbi . 1006126 . g007 3 - helix intermediates in talin and α - catenin PLOS Computational Biology | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pcbi . 1006126 April 26 , 2018 13 / 19 mutation has been recognized as disease causing , in the talin - 2 isoform located outside of the mechanosensitive region [ 48 ] . We show that α - helical proteins unfold via stable 3 - helix intermediate states , representing biologically active states . smAFM and disulphide clamp mutations were used to confirm the models obtained with SMD . Our results suggest that talin is a central scaffolding hub in focal adhesions with multiple discrete unfolding states , acting as a sophisticated mechanosensor and an important regulatory switch . We further propose that the mechanical stability of α - helical domains as well as the mechanical stability of their unfolding intermediates should be consid - ered when studying mechanoregulation models of α - helical proteins . Materials and methods SMD simulations The following structures from RCSB Protein Data Bank were used as the protein models for the individual talin rod subdomains : R3 ( id 2L7A residues 796 to 909 ) , R9 ( id 2KBB ) and R11 ( id 3dYJ residues 1975 to 2140 ) . Talin R9 tandems were constructed using PyMOL , by creating a peptide bond between the last residue of the first R9 monomer and the first residue of the second R9 monomer . α - catenin including M I and M II domains ( id 4IGG residues 275 to 506 ) was used in our simulations . The point mutations introducing cysteine residues into the talin rod subdomains in order to form the disulphide bonds ( clamps ) preventing the unfolding of 3 - helix state , were designed and mutated using PyMOL . MD and SMD simulations were performed using Gromacs ver 2016 . 1 [ 49 , 50 ] at the Sisu supercomputer , CSC , Finland . The CHARMM27 force field [ 51 ] and explicit TIP3P water model [ 52 ] in 0 . 15 M KCl solution were used and the total charge of the system was adjusted by K + and Cl - ions . The energy minimization of the system was performed in 10 000 steps using the steepest descent algorithm . The system was equilibrated in three phases using harmonic position restraints on all heavy atoms of the protein . The first phase of the equilibration was performed with NVT ensemble for 100 ps using the Berendsen weak coupling algorithm [ 53 ] to control the temperature of the system at 100 K . Integration time step of 2 fs was used in all the simulations . Following the NVT , the system was linearly heated from 100 to 310 K over 1 ns using an NPT ensemble at 1 atm of pressure . During this process , the Berendsen algorithm was used to control both temperature and pressure . For the final phase of equilibration and for all subsequent simulations , an NPT ensemble was maintained at 310 K using the V - rescale algorithm [ 54 ] , and 1 atm as implemented in Gromacs 2016 . 1 . The temperature coupling was applied separately for the protein and the solution parts . Each system was equilibrated up to 30 ns , with subsequent monitoring of the root mean square deviations ( RMSD ) of C α atoms , con - sidering the first approx . 5 ns as relaxation step . Hence , snapshots at 5 ns were used as starting structures for SMD simulations . Pulling vector was set between C α of the first and the last resi - due of the appropriate domain . The movement of C α of N - terminal residue was restrained with harmonic potential , while C α of C - terminal residue was subjected to the constant velocity or constant force pulling . The pressure control was turned off for the pulling dimension ( z - axes ) in all SMD simulations as described in our previous work [ 28 ] . The constant velocity pull - ing SMD simulations were performed at 2 nm / ns with the spring constant set to 1000 kJ / mol nm 2 . In the constant force pulling SMD simulations , different force regimes were applied , 160 pN , 170 pN , 180 pN and 200 pN for R3 and 200 pN , 220 pN , 230 pN , 250 pN and 300 pN for R9 . The system size in SMD was 227 thousand atoms for R3 , about 800 thousand atoms for R9 , R11 and α - catenin M I - M II , and about 1 . 2 million atoms for R9 tandems . Detailed compo - sition of the systems used SMD simulations shown in S2 Table . 3 - helix intermediates in talin and α - catenin PLOS Computational Biology | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pcbi . 1006126 April 26 , 2018 14 / 19 Generation of polyprotein constructs The constructs and experimental procedure for the smAFM were similar to those described before [ 28 ] . The talin fragment polyprotein constructs , including flanking I27 , were synthe - sized and cloned in to pFN18a . The polyproteins were expressed in E . coli BL21 - CodonPlus ( DE3 ) - RILP competent cells , using the T7 promoter present in the plasmid . Protein expression was induced with IPTG when the culture reached an OD600 nm of 0 . 6 . Cells were lysed by applying 0 . 2 mg / ml lysozyme for 30 minutes at 25˚C , followed by sonication with an Sonifier cell disruptor model SLPe ( Branson Ultrasonics Corporation , USA ) and clarification of the lysate using centrifugation . The clarified lysate was subjected to Ni - NTA affinity chromatogra - phy beads in a batch process . The proteins eluted with imidazole were analyzed for purity with SDS - PAGE and used at a final concentration between 1 – 10 ug / mL . Preparation of ligand - functionalized surfaces Glass coverslips were functionalized with the chloroalkane ligand to HaloTag as previously described [ 28 ] . The glass coverslips were first cleaned using Helmanex III ( 1 % in water ) , ace - tone , and ethanol washes . The surfaces were then prepped with O 2 plasma cleaning for 15 min . Surfaces were then silanized using ( 3 - aminopropyl ) trimethoxysilane , diluted to 1 % in ethanol . Surfaces were then washed with ethanol and then dried with N 2 . These amine - functionalized surfaces were then incubated with 10 mM succinimidyl - [ ( N - maleimidopropionamido ) tetraco - saethylene glycol ] ester ( SMPEG24 – Thermo ) diluted in 100 mM borax buffer ( pH 8 . 5 ) for 1 h . The final step involved incubating the surfaces overnight with 10 mMHaloTag Thiol O4 ligand in the same buffer . The surfaces were quenched with 50 mM 2 - mercaptoethanol in water . AFM experiments and analysis We used a commercial AFS - 1 from Luigs & Neumann , GmbH , based on a device developed at the Fernandez Lab , Columbia University [ 55 ] . The cantilevers used were gold - coated OBL - 10 levers from Bruker . The spring constants varied between 4 and 10 pN / nm as measured by equipartition theorem with the appropriate adjustments for cantilever geometry [ 56 , 57 ] . Around 20 μL of protein solution was incubated on functionalized coverslips for 30 min prior to the experiments to allow for HaloTag binding . The cantilever was pressed into the surface with a force of * 300 pN to bind the cantilever to the polyprotein . Force extension experiments were conducted at 400 nm / s retraction rate . Data analysis was carried out using Igor Pro ( Wavemetrics ) . Unfolding peaks were identified by adjustable smoothing with a moving box average and then by searching for local maxima . The force of the peaks along with their unadjusted distance from the HaloTag benchmark was measured . Supporting information S1 Fig . Design of disulphide clamps in R9 .
