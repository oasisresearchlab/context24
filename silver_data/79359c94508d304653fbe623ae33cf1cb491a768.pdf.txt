Abstract The pluripotency of embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) is maintained by a small group of master transcription factors including Oct4 , Sox2 and Nanog . These core factors form a regulatory circuit controlling the transcription of a number of pluripotency factors including themselves . Although previous studies have identified transcriptional regulators of this core network , the cis - regulatory DNA sequences required for the transcription of these key pluripotency factors remain to be defined . We analyzed epigenomic data within the 1 . 5 Mb gene - desert regions around the Sox2 gene and identified a 13kb - long super - enhancer ( SE ) located 100kb downstream of Sox2 in mouse ESCs . This SE is occupied by Oct4 , Sox2 , Nanog , and the mediator complex , and physically interacts with the Sox2 locus via DNA looping . Using a simple and highly efficient double - CRISPR genome editing strategy we deleted the entire 13 - kb SE and characterized transcriptional defects in the resulting monoallelic and biallelic deletion clones with RNA - seq . We showed that the SE is responsible for over 90 % of Sox2 expression , and Sox2 is the only target gene along the chromosome . Our results support the functional significance of a SE in maintaining the pluripotency transcription program in mouse ESCs .

PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0114485 December 8 , 2014 1 / 17 Introduction Sox2 is one of the three core transcription factors ( Oct4 , Sox2 , Nanog ) responsible for maintaining ESC pluripotency . These core pluripotency factors form auto - regulatory loops and transcriptionally induce a cohort of other key pluripotency genes [ 1 - 3 ] . Besides ESCs , Sox2 is also expressed in various types of adult stem cells [ 4 , 5 ] . Recently , it has been reported that Sox2 - expressing cancer stem cells may drive tumor initiation and relapse in medulloblastoma and skin tumor [ 6 , 7 ] . Therefore , elucidating the transcriptional regulation mechanisms of Sox2 gene is important for the understanding of both pluripotency and tumorigenesis . Enhancers play a critical role in regulating metazoan gene transcription [ 8 - 11 ] . Recent genome - wide analyses have revealed that enhancers are very abundant in the genome . Additionally , highly specific enhancer landscapes are responsible for cellular identity as they regulate distinct transcriptional programs in different cell types [ 12 - 16 ] . Clusters of enhancer constituents that together generate a domain of MED1 - , and transcription factor - binding , and H3K27ac enrichment have been identified as super - enhancers ( SE ) or stretch enhancers [ 17 - 19 ] . Compelling genomic evidence has predicted that SEs play a particularly important role in the control of cell identity and diseases [ 17 - 19 ] , but direct functional evidence is lacking . Until recently , validating the in vivo function of a putative enhancer has proven technically difficult . Reporter assays confirm that the sequence can function as an enhancer exogenously , but it does not demonstrate whether a distal target gene can be activated by the enhancer in vivo . Knocking out the enhancer sequence is the gold standard approach , but conventional methods using homologous recombination are inefficient and labor - intensive . The recently developed CRISPR / Cas9 system [ 20 , 21 ] has proven to be a highly efficient genome editing technique and offers a promising method to validate enhancer functions in vivo . A recent study used CRISPR to validate the importance of a SE near GATA2 in chronic myeloid leukemia by demonstrating it is responsible for 80 % of GATA2 expression [ 22 ] . With this recent advance , we have attempted to examine the role of SEs in pluripotency and normal development . In the mouse genome , Sox2 is located within a , 1 . 5Mb gene desert region . It has been postulated that regulatory sequences may lie in such gene deserts and modulate gene expression over long distances [ 23 ] . In this study , we examined the gene desert near Sox2 and identified a putative distal super enhancer that is marked by active histone marks only in ESCs . This 13kb - long enhancer is occupied by multiple pluripotency factors and forms a long - distance DNA loop with the Sox2 promoter from 100kb away . Using a double - CRISPR excision strategy , we studied the in vivo function of this SE and demonstrated that it is responsible for over 90 % of Sox2 gene expression in mouse ESCs . Our results therefore provide direct evidences on the key roles of a SE in governing ESC pluripotency . Sox2 Super - Enhancer Deletion Using CRISPR PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0114485 December 8 , 2014 2 / 17 Methods and Materials Cell culture and transfection experiments The F1 Mus musculus castaneus 6 S129 / SvJae mouse ESC line ( F123 line ) was a gift from the laboratory of Dr . Edith Heard and was previously described [ 24 ] . The cells were cultured as described previously [ 25 ] . Importantly , cells were passaged twice on 0 . 1 % gelatin - coated feeder - free plates before harvesting . F123 cells were plated at a density of 0 . 5 million / mL on 0 . 1 % gelatin - coated feeder - free plates 24 hours before transfection . Cells were triple transfected using the Mouse ES Cell Nucleofector Kit ( Lonza ) and Amaxa Nucleofector with 7 . 5ug of each CRISPR plasmid and 5ug of pBABE - Puro . Post - transfection , cells were immediately plated on puromycin - resistant MEF feeders ( GlobalStem ) for recovery . 48 hours after transfection 2 m g / mL of puromycin ( Sigma ) was supplemented to the cell culture media for 3 days to select for transfected cells . Alkaline phosphatase staining was performed using mESC culture in the presence of MEF feeder cells with the Alkaline Phosphatase Staining kit ( Stemgent ) . For growth curve analysis , control and mutant ES cells were plated at 1 6 10 5 cells in triplicates on 12 - well plates and counted for six consecutive days . The cells were passaged on day 4 by making 1 : 3 dilutions . The cell numbers on day 5 and 6 were multiplied by three to adjust for the dilution . Design of CRISPR constructs for enhancer deletion Target - specific CRISPR guide RNAs were designed to optimize uniqueness and have limited off - targets using an online tool ( http : / / crispr . mit . edu / ) . Corresponding oligonucleotides were ordered ( IDT ) and subcloned into the pX330 plasmid ( Addgene ) , expressing a human codon - optimized SpCas9 and chimeric guide RNA expression plasmid , following previously published guide - lines [ 20 ] . The sequences flanking mEnh - Sox2 distal targeted by the CRISPR constructs are : 5 9 - CRISPR : GACGCTTCCGTTCTTGGAGT AGG 3 9 - CRISPR : TTGGATTCCCGACAACAAGC TGG PCR and Sanger sequencing for genotyping deletion clones Genomic DNA was isolated from clonal CRISPR targeted F123 cell lines using a DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit ( Qiagen ) . To screen deletion clones , SE - spanning PCR primers were designed which flank the outside of the CRISPR sgRNAs and amplify a 13kb + region . Given efficient CRISPR cutting and repair of DNA through non - homologous end joining , a , 420bp product is expected . For PCR , 20ng of genomic DNA was used and amplified with Q5 High - Fidelity DNA Polymerase ( NEB ) . Subsequently , a qPCR - based genotyping method was designed to quantify the DNA copy number of the targeted regions relative to control regions . qPCR copy number primers were designed inside the targeted region to quantify the efficiency of CRISPR deletion as creating a biallelic or monoallelic deletion . qPCR was Sox2 Super - Enhancer Deletion Using CRISPR PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0114485 December 8 , 2014 3 / 17 performed with 10ng of genomic DNA in triplicate using SYBR green master mix ( Roche ) on the LightCycler 480 ( Roche ) . Relative levels of DNA copy number were calculated using the DD Ct method with copy number normalized to GAPDH intron 1 ( chromosome 6 ) as a control . Finally , Sanger sequencing was used to confirm the qPCR genotyping result and further characterize the deletion junction . The , 420bp products from PCR were TOPO - cloned using a Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit ( Qiagen ) . Purified plasmid was Sanger sequenced ( Retrogen ) using the M13 F primer . Sanger sequencing data of one of the biallelic ( confirmed by copy number analysis ) SE deletion clone were not available because we failed to expand it upon freeze / thaw . The following equation was used to calculate deletion efficiency : Deletion frequency 5 ( ( # monoallelic clones ) + 2 * ( # biallelic clones ) ) / ( 2 * ( # of total clones ) ) . The following are the primers used : mEnh - Sox2 distal PCR Deletion - spanning primers F : CCTCAAAGTGCATCTCGTCA R : GTCCCCTCGGCTTCTGTACT mEnh - Sox2 distal copy number qPCR primers F : CAAATGCGCCTCTCACTTTA R : TTCCCAGCAGTGCTTGTATG qPCR copy number control primers : GAPDH intron 1 ( chromosome 6 ) F : CTGGCACTGCACAAGAAGAT R : GGGTTCCTATAAATACGGACTGC M13F Sanger Sequencing Primer F : GTTTTCCCAGTCACGACGTTGTA RNA isolation and allele - specific RT - qPCR Total RNA was isolated by TRIzol ( Life Tech ) extraction and DNaseI ( Life Tech ) treated . The SuperScript III First - Strand Synthesis SuperMix for RT - qPCR kit ( Life Tech ) was used for synthesis of cDNA from 1ug of RNA . RT - qPCR was performed in triplicate using SYBR green master mix ( Roche ) on the LightCycler 480 ( Roche ) . Relative levels of gene expression were normalized to beta actin ( Actb ) . RT - qPCR primers for Actb are ( Fwd : 5 9 - CTGGCTCCTAGCACCATGAAGATC ; Rev : 5 9 - TGCTGATCCACATCTGCTGG ) . The primer sequences used in this study are Pou5f1 ( F : 5 9 - GTTGGAGAAGGTGGAACCAA , R : 5 9 - CCAAGGTGATCCTCTTCTGC ) , Nanog ( F : 5 9 - ATGCCTGCAGTTTTTCATCC , R : 5 9 - GAGGAAGGGCGAGGAGAG ) , Esrrb ( F : 5 9 - ACATTGCCTCTGGCTACCAC , R : 5 9 - CGGGCAGTTGTACTCGATG ) , Klf4 ( F : 5 9 - CAGGCTGTGGCAAAACCTAT , R : 5 9 - CGTCCCAGTCACAGTGGTAA ) , Kit ( F : 5 9 - CGTGAACTCCATGTGGCTAA , R : 5 9 - CGTCTCCTGGCGTTCATAAT ) . To assay the allele - specific expression from Sox2 locus , we used a common forward primer to measure the Sox2 gene expression level ( Sox2 - F : 5 9 - ACATGTGAGGGCTGGACT ) . A universal reverse primer ( R - universal : 5 9 - CCTTTTGAGCATTATCAGATTTTTC ) is used to measure the total Sox2 Sox2 Super - Enhancer Deletion Using CRISPR PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0114485 December 8 , 2014 4 / 17 expression level . We used two different reverse primers to measure Sox2 expression from the CAST ( R - CAST : CTTTTGAGCATTATCAGATTTTTCT ) or 129 allele ( R - 129 : CTTTTGAGCATTATCAGATTTTTCC ) . Strand - specific RNA - seq PolyA + RNA was captured from ten micrograms of total RNA using Oligo ( dT ) 25 Dynabeads ( Invitrogen ) . The resulting RNA fraction was subjected to first - strand cDNA synthesis using random primers and dT oligos in the presence of actinomycin D . Samples were cleaned up by applying the reaction mix to mini G50 columns . The eluted sample was then subjected to second - strand synthesis with DNA polymerase I , DNA ligase , and dUNTPs in the presence of RNase H . This ensures that the cDNA strand complementary to the mRNA has dNTPs and that the other strand is specifically labeled with dUNTPs . The cDNA was purified by QIA - quick columns and sheared using a Bioruptor ( Diagenode ) . The fragmented cDNA was subsequently end repaired , A - tailed , and then ligated to Illumina TruSeq adapters . The samples were run on a 2 % high - resolution agarose gel and fragments were size - selected from 200bp - 450bp . The fragments were then treated with UDGase to remove the labeled strand , and mRNA complementary cDNA strand was amplified by PCR and sequenced ( 2 6 100bp ) using the Illumina HiSeq2000 . ChIP - seq ChIP - Seq was carried out as previously described [ 26 ] with 500 m g chromatin and 5 m g antibody with the following antibodies , H3K27ac ( Abcam , ab4729 ) and H3K4me3 ( Millipore , 04 - 745 ) . ChIP and input library preparation and sequencing procedures were carried out as described previously according to Illumina protocols with minor modifications ( Illumina , San Diego , CA ) . Bioinformatic analysis All the sequencing data were mapped to mm9 . ChIP - seq and Hi - C data analysis were performed as described previously [ 27 ] . For RNA - seq analysis , reads were mapped using Novoalign and USeq . FPKM for known mouse genes were generated using in - house scripts . To identify signature genes , a pseudo number of 4 was added to the FPKM value of each gene and a 3 - fold cutoff was used to identify significantly changed genes comparing wild type and enhancer knockout clones . CAST and 129 genotypes were generated , and strain - specific reads at CAST and 129 SNPs were separated as described previously [ 25 ] . To improve the accuracy of calling genetic variants between the two mouse strains , we also removed a subset of variants that showed inherent biases from all downstream analyses . Briefly , we generated dummy reads across each SNP / Indel and mapped them to the genome : SNPs that showed . 5 % bias and Indels showing . 10 % bias are ignored . We also checked for copy number variation across the two alleles and ignored variants that showed significant bias ( 5 % FDR ) . Finally , we removed Sox2 Super - Enhancer Deletion Using CRISPR PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0114485 December 8 , 2014 5 / 17 variants identified as poor heterozygous calls ( 5 % FDR ) [ 25 ] . Functional analysis of the signature genes was performed using DAVID and GSEA . Data availability The raw data for ChIP - seq and RNA - seq experiments performed in this study have been uploaded to GEO with accession number ( GSE60763 ) . The following epigenomic data used in this study were published previously : H3K27ac ChIP - seq in different mouse tissues , and p300 ChIP - seq in mESCs [ 28 ] ( GSE29218 ) ; ChIP - seq of Med1 , Oct4 , Sox2 and Nanog in mouse ES cells [ 19 ] ( GSE44288 ) ; Hi - C data in mouse J1 ES cells [ 29 ] ( GSE34156 ) and F123 ES cells [ 25 ] ( GSE48592 ) were combined for the analysis in this study . Results Identification of a distal Sox2 super - enhancer in mouse ESCs We examined ENCODE ChIP - seq data from 23 different mouse tissues or cell types focusing on the Sox2 locus ( Fig . 1 ) . Using H3K27ac , a histone mark for active enhancers [ 30 , 31 ] , we observed a distal SE that is only present in mouse ESC lines , which is approximately 100kb downstream from the Sox2 locus . This sequence spans a relatively large 13kb region , and corresponds to a recently defined super - enhancer [ 19 ] or stretch enhancer [ 18 ] . Indeed , this region ( referred to as Sox2 - SE distal hereafter ) is one of the SEs previously identified in mouse ESCs [ 19 ] . Interestingly , although Sox2 is also expressed in several brain tissues , Sox2 - SE distal is not active in those tissues . Instead , a different region upstream of the Sox2 locus is marked by H3K27ac in brain tissues ( Fig . 1 ) , suggesting that Sox2 is regulated by different mechanisms in ESCs and neural tissues involving different cis - regulatory elements . Indeed a part of the region marked by H3K27ac in brain tissues has been shown to drive Sox2 expression in telencephalic neural stem cells [ 32 ] . Epigenetic characterization of the Sox2 - SE distal in mouse ESCs We next examined the epigenetic features at Sox2 - SE distal . First , we observed strong H3K27ac signal at this SE in two additional mouse ES cell lines ( F123 and J1 ) , indicating that usage of this SE is conserved across different mice strains . Previously published ChIP - seq data shows that Sox2 - SE distal is occupied by Oct4 , Sox2 and Nanog ( Fig . 2 ) . In this study , we also observed strong binding of the transcriptional co - activator p300 and the mediator complex ( Med1 ) ( Fig . 2 ) . To test if Sox2 - SE distal regulates Sox2 gene through long - range DNA looping , we analyzed DNA looping interactions using Hi - C data generated from mouse ESCs [ 27 ] and observed specific DNA looping signal between Sox2 - SE distal and the Sox2 promoter ( Fig . 2 ) . This long - range chromatin interaction was also observed in two other independent studies using 5C [ 33 ] and ChIA - PET [ 34 ] in mouse ESCs . Sox2 Super - Enhancer Deletion Using CRISPR PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0114485 December 8 , 2014 6 / 17 Taken together , these results suggest that Sox2 - SE distal could be involved in the core pluripotency circuitry through regulating Sox2 gene expression . A simple and efficient strategy to disrupt enhancers with CRISPR To test the in vivo function of Sox2 - SE distal , we sought to delete the entire enhancer sequence from the endogenous locus . Given that the SE spans a , 13kb region , deletion of this region using conventional methods would be very inefficient . Therefore , we explored whether the recently developed CRISPR technology [ 20 , 21 ] could be utilized to delete this large non - coding sequence in mouse ESCs . In the CRISPR / Cas9 system , a small guide RNA ( sgRNA ) targets the Cas9 protein to a specific genomic location and generates a double - strand break . Random mutations can be generated when the DNA break is repaired via non - homologous end joining ( NHEJ ) . The efficiency of DNA cutting by the CRISPR / Cas9 system may reach over 90 % , therefore it is possible to introduce multiple mutations in the same cell with high efficiency [ 35 ] . We postulated that if we Figure 1 . Identification of a distal mouse ESC - specific super - enhancer near Sox2 gene . In a genome - browser snapshot , 23 tracks of H3K27ac ChIP - seq data are shown .

We therefore used this simple approach to delete Sox2 - SE distal in the hybrid F123 mouse ESC line ( see method and materials ) derived from a cross between two inbred strains , CAST and 129 [ 24 ] ( Fig . 3A ) . This cell line was chosen for its high SNP density and a priori haplotypes . Given these characteristics , this cell line is especially amendable to robust allelic analysis of CRISPR - based deletions and downstream functional assays . After co - transfecting two sgRNA constructs , 8 out of 16 ESC clones had the desired enhancer deletion on at least one allele ( Fig . 3B ) . Copy number analysis revealed that Sox2 - SE distal was deleted from both alleles ( biallelic clones ) in 2 clones , and from one allele in the remaining 6 clones ( monoallelic clones ) ( Fig . 3C ) . Further genotyping analysis using Sanger sequencing confirmed that among the 6 monoallelic clones , five had a deletion on the 129 allele and one on the CAST allele ( Fig . 3D , S1 Figure ) . Taken together , these results suggest that our double - CRISPR strategy can delete large genomic sequences with very high efficiency ( 31 . 25 % , see methods ) . In fact , a recent study also took a similar approach in mouse erythroleukemia cells and achieved a similar deletion frequency [ 36 ] . Figure 2 . Characterization of the distal Sox2 super - enhancer . In a genome - browser snapshot , the top Hi - C track is a bar graph showing the Hi - C read number in mouse ESCs using Sox2 as the anchor ( highlighted in yellow ) . Each bar represents one HindIII fragment between two HindIII cutting sites . The bar height represents the Hi - C read count from the anchor to the HindIII fragment . The 2 nd Hi - C track plots the expected value for every HindIII fragment . Therefore the blue highlighted region is a significant looping interaction from the Sox2 promoter to Sox2 - SE distal after comparing the top two tracks .

In wild type ( WT ) clones , both CAST and 129 alleles contribute to roughly half of total Sox2 expression ( Fig . 4A ) . Strikingly , in the biallelic SE knockout clone , Sox2 expression is almost completely lost , while in monoallelic SE knockout clones , total Sox2 expression level is reduced by roughly 50 % ( Fig . 4A ) . Importantly , in the monoallelic clones , the level of Sox2 expression from the knockout allele is only , 7 % of the intact allele on average ( Fig . 4A ) . These results reveal that a single SE , Sox2 - SE distal , regulates Figure 3 .

In order to further test the cis and trans effects of the enhancer deletion on the transcriptome , we performed RNA - seq in four representative clones with different scenarios of enhancer deletion ( WT , biallelic mutation , 129 monoallelic mutation , and CAST monoallelic mutation ) . Based on the sequences of RNA - seq reads and SNPs called for both parental alleles , we can determine the transcriptional outputs from the 129 or CAST allele for every gene ( Fig . 4B ) . Consistent with the RT - qPCR data , the RNA - seq results also supported our conclusion that Sox2 - SE distal is required for Sox2 gene transcription . Importantly , none of the other genes on the same chromosomes are directly affected by Sox2 - SE distal deletion ( Fig . 4B – C ) , suggesting Sox2 is the only target gene of Sox2 - SE distal . It is noteworthy that Sox2 is the only active protein - coding gene sharing the same TAD [ 29 ] with Sox2 - SE distal ( Fig . 4B ) . Sox2 - SE distal deletion alters transcription of key pluripotency genes As expected , Sox2 - SE distal deletion affected the proliferation and morphology of mESC culture , due to reduced expression of Sox2 and several other pluripotency factors ( Fig . 5A - B , S2 Figure ) . We further analyzed the effects of Sox2 - SE distal deletion on the transcriptome using the RNA - seq data in different types of mutant clones ( S1 Table ) . Comparing the biallelic knockout clone to the WT clone , we identified a signature of 136 up - regulated genes and 142 down - regulated genes ( including Sox2 ) using a 3 - fold cutoff ( Fig . 5C , S2 – S3 Tables ) . Importantly , transcription levels of most of these genes also show significant change in the monoallelic SE knockout clones ( Fig . 5D ) , although to a lesser extent ( Fig . 5E ) . These results suggest that partial loss of Sox2 expression also results in significant trans effects on gene transcription in mouse ESCs . 21 out of the 142 down - regulated genes have Sox2 binding sites at promoters , while only 6 up - regulated genes have Sox2 binding at promoters ( Fig . 5F , S4 Table ) , suggesting some of these genes are direct targets of Sox2 transactivation . However , we cannot exclude the possibility that some genes are affected by Sox2 - SE distal deletion through trans - interactions or other indirect mechanisms . Gene ontology ( GO ) analysis revealed distinct functions between up - regulated and down - regulated signature genes upon Sox2 - SE distal deletion . Consistent with the role of Sox2 as a core pluripotency factor , down - regulated signature genes are key genes involved in stem cell maintenance and early development , including Nanog , Klf4 , Esrrb , Tet1 , and Kit . ( Fig . 5G ) . On the other hand , up - regulated signature genes are involved in late development and specialized cellular functions such as cell migration and cell communication ( Fig . 5G ) . shows CAST specific expression in CAST + / 129 - clone and 129 specific expression in CAST - / 129 + clone , suggesting direct regulation by Sox2 - SE distal . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0114485 . g004 Sox2 Super - Enhancer Deletion Using CRISPR PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0114485 December 8 , 2014 11 / 17 Figure 5 .

Remarkably , we found that the Sox2 - SE distal knockout signature anti - correlates with the signature in mouse ESCs lacking the Suz12 gene [ 37 ] . Suz12 is a key component of polycomb repressive complex 2 ( PRC2 ) , which has been shown to be required for ESC differentiation [ 38 ] . Consistently , we observed a significant fraction of up - regulated signature genes that are down - regulated in Suz12 - / - mouse ESCs , while the expression levels of a significant fraction of down - regulated signature genes are elevated in Suz12 - / - mouse ESCs ( Fig . 5H ) . It has been previously shown that Suz12 binds to a significant fraction of key developmental regulators in mESCs , and those genes are often co - occupied by Oct4 , Sox2 and Nanog [ 39 ] . Our results therefore agree with a model that PRC2 antagonizes the core pluripotency factors in regulating target gene expression during differentiation . Discussion We identified a mouse ESC - specific regulatory region that controls Sox2 expression through long - range DNA looping . Sox2 - SE distal is an exceptionally large ( , 13kb ) cluster of H3K27ac enrichment thereby fitting the criteria of recently defined super - enhancers or stretch enhancers [ 18 , 19 ] . It has been proposed that SEs may play a key role in maintaining cell identity , and our results provide unambiguous functional data supporting this hypothesis . Interestingly , we also observed a different SE proximal to Sox2 that is also marked by histone H3K27ac exclusively in brain tissues ( Fig . 1 ) . This could be an SE that drives Sox2 expression in brain . It will be interesting to further explore how the Sox2 gene transitions to different enhancer usage during the development of central nervous system ( CNS ) . Importantly , we have demonstrated the feasibility of using a simple double - CRISPR excision strategy to delete a 13kb non - coding region ( Fig . 3A ) . Because of the high efficiency of the CRISPR / Cas9 system , two double - strand breaks can be generated simultaneously on the same chromosome , leading to the loss of an entire 13kb region between the two targeting sites . The usage of a hybrid cell line ( F123 ) also allows allele - specific measurements of enhancer activity . Upon deletion of Sox2 - SE distal using CRISPR , we found Sox2 expression is reduced by over 90 % . As expected , Sox2 - SE distal deletion reduces the transcription of a number of key pluripotency genes and also induces a differentiation gene signature . We believe CRISPR will be a powerful tool for future study of in vivo enhancer function . It is also striking that Sox2 - SE distal regulates expression of Sox2 , which is located 100kb away , without affecting other nearby genes . This implies that enhancers engage in highly selective long - range interactions , and their regulation should not be simplified by assuming they regulate the nearest gene . One possible explanation for this specificity lies in the specific looping interaction between Sox2 and Sox2 Super - Enhancer Deletion Using CRISPR PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0114485 December 8 , 2014 13 / 17 Sox2 - SE distal . Our analysis of Hi - C data shows significant interaction between Sox2 and Sox2 - SE distal ( Fig . 2 ) . It is also noteworthy that , while there are other genes near Sox2 - SE distal , only the Sox2 promoter is marked by a strong peak of H3K4me3 within the same topological domain [ 29 ] , which could explain why only the Sox2 gene is targeted by Sox2 - SE distal . A similar phenomenon was also observed in a recent study on GATA2 super - enhancer [ 22 ] . It came to our attention that a part of the region we deleted overlaps with 5 9 end of the Peril ncRNA transcript [ 40 ] . As a result , the Peril transcript was lost from the alleles with Sox2 - SE distal deletion ( data not shown ) . However , Sauvageau et al . did not observe significant loss of Sox2 expression in mouse embryos when they knocked out Peril . Therefore , we conclude that the effect of the Sox2 - SE distal deletion on Sox2 expression is not due to loss of Peril transcript . Understanding how genomic information directs tissue - specific gene expres - sion remains a major challenge . Identification of cis - regulatory elements from epigenomic information and validation by efficient genome editing techniques will be a paradigm of how to study gene regulation .
