V . 3435 36 37 38 1 . Introduction 39 Podosomes are cell - matrix contacts present at the ventral side of 40 myeloid , smooth muscle and endothelial cells . They consist of an F - 41 actin core with actin regulators such as Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome 42 protein ( WASP ) and actin - related protein ( Arp2 / 3 ) , and an adhesive 43 ring rich in vinculin and talin , among others [ 1 ] . Podosomes differ 44 from invadopodia , their counterparts in cancer cells , in lifetime , pro - 45 trusive dimensions and actin network arrangement [ 2 ] . Functionally , 46 podosomes are involved in adhesion [ 1 ] , matrix degradation [ 3 ] , 47 mechanosensing [ 4 ] and directional migration [ 5 ] . Furthermore , 48 they contribute to invasive cell migration in vivo [ 6 , 7 ] . Pathological - 49 ly , podosome loss is linked to defects in immune cell migration in pa - 50 tients carrying WASP mutations [ 8 ] and to defects in bone resorption 51 by failure of osteoclast sealing zone formation [ 9 ] . 52 The actin - bundling protein fascin is aberrantly expressed in nu - 53 merous cancer types and is considered a metastatic marker and ther - 54 apeutic target [ 10 ] . Fascin has been detected in invadopodia where it 55 stabilizes actin and contributes to turnover , matrix degradation and 56 invasion [ 11 , 12 ] . Podosomes also contain fascin , although its precise 57 function remains unclear as both an assembling and disassembling 58 role were previously reported [ 13 , 14 ] . In dendritic cells ( DC ) , fascin 59 levels are induced upon maturation [ 15 ] thereby contributing to mi - 60 gration [ 14 ] and antigen presentation [ 16 ] . 61 Cortactin and hematopoietic lineage cell - speci ﬁ c protein - 1 62 ( HS1 ) are multidomain proteins consisting of an NTA acidic Arp2 / 63 3 - binding domain , actin binding repeats , a helical domain , a 64 proline - rich regulatory domain and an Src - homology 3 ( SH3 ) do - 65 main interacting with ( neural ) - Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein 66 ( N ) - WASP , WASP - interacting protein ( WIP ) or dynaminII among 67 others [ 17 ] .

HS1 on the 70 other hand is expressed in hematopoietic cells where it regulates 71 lamellipodial dynamics , directional migration , antigen uptake and 72 presentation [ 20 , 21 ] . However , the role of cortactin next to HS1 in 73 macrophages or DC is still unclear . 74 Nanobodies represent the antigen - binding fragments of Camelid 75 heavy - chain antibodies [ 22 ] . Due to their size ( 15 kDa ) , stability , 76 speci ﬁ city and af ﬁ nity they have become an emerging tool in re - 77 search , diagnostics and therapeutics [ 23 ] . Their target - modulating 78 activity in combination with their intracellular functionality makes 79 them useful for knockout of endogenous protein functions or do - 80 mains [ 24 – 27 , 12 ] . 81 In this study we applied nanobodies against fascin and cortactin 82 to gain insight into their speci ﬁ c contributions in podosome forma - 83 tion , dynamics and function . The fascin nanobody ( FASNb5 ) inhibits 84 actin bundling activity . The cortactin - targeting nanobody ( CORNb2 ) 85 binds the SH3 domain but does not cross - react with its homologue 86 HS1 [ 12 ] . With these tools , we unravel a podosome disassembling 87 role dependent on fascin actin bundling activity and an assembling 88 role relying on the cortactin SH3 domain in THP - 1 macrophages 89 and DC . Fascin activity modi ﬁ es the network from branched towards 90 bundled actin ﬁ laments resulting in podosome turnover , disassem - 91 bly and recycling of constituents . The cortactin SH3 domain on the 92 other hand contributes to proper podosome assembly without af - 93 fecting dynamics . Both functional knockouts lead to a switch from 94 podosomes to focal adhesions and eventually affect the degrading 95 and migratory phenotype . 96 2 . Material and methods 97 2 . 1 . Antibodies and reagents 98 Rabbit polyclonal anti - fascin ( FSCN1 ) , mouse monoclonal anti - 99 vinculin ( hVIN - 1 ) and V5 - agarose ( V5 – 10 ) were obtained from Sigma 100 ( St .

Generation of nanobodies , cDNA cloning and recombinant production 115 Fascin andcortactin nanobodies were obtained in collaboration with 116 the VIB nanobody service facility and cloned and produced as described 117 earlier [ 12 ] . 118 2 . 3 . Cell culture , transduction and transfection 119 THP - 1 monocytic cells ( ATCC TIB - 202 ™ ) and primary DC were 120 maintained at 37 °C in a humi ﬁ ed 5 % CO2 incubator and grown in 121 RPMI . MDA - MB - 231 cells were grown in DMEM and PC - 3 cells in 122 RPMI , both at 10 % CO 2 . All media were supplemented with 10 % FBS 123 ( heat - inactivated for DC ) , 100 μ g / mL streptomycin and 100 IU / mL 124 penicillin . For THP - 1 cells , also 0 . 05 mM β - mercaptoethanol was 125 supplemented . Cell culture media were obtained from Gibco Life 126 Technologies ( Grand Island , NY , USA ) . Differentiation of THP - 1 cells 127 into macrophages was achieved by stimulation with 350 nM phorbol 128 12 - myristate 13 - acetate ( PMA ) for 2 – 4 days . Stable and inducible 129 expression of EGFP - tagged ( enhanced green ﬂ uorescent protein ) 130 nanobodies in THP - 1 cells was achieved by the Lenti - X Tet - On Ad - 131 vanced system of Clontech ( Mountain View , CA , USA ) as described 132 earlier [ 24 , 12 ] . Expression was induced with 500 ng / mL doxycycline 133 for 24 – 48 h . Cells were additionally transduced with LifeAct – Cherry 134 for live cell imaging . For DC generation , human peripheral blood 135 mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) were isolated by Lymphoprep density 136 centrifugation ( Stemcell technologies , Grenoble , France ) from 137 whole blood samples of healthy donors with informed consent as 138 approved by the local ethical committee ( EC UZGhent 2013 / 467 ) . 139 Adhesion selection was performed to enrich for monocytes and dif - 140 ferentiation into DC was induced by addition of 20 ng / mL 141 interleukin - 4 ( IL - 4 ) and 50 ng / mL granulocyte macrophage colony - 142 stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) for 6 days ( both from Peprotech , 143 Rocky Hill , NJ , USA ) . DC were matured by overnight incubation 144 with 0 . 1 μ g / mL lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) ( Sigma ) . Transfection of 145 DC was performed with a Neon nucleofection device ( Lonza , 146 Cologne , Germany ) according to the manufacturer ' s protocol . Brie ﬂ y , 147 700 , 000 Q3 differentiated DC in 100 μ L R buffer were added to 3 . 5 μ g 148 DNA and pulsed two times ( 1000 V , 40 mA ) . 149 2 . 4 . Immunostaining and microscopy 150 Immunostaining was performed as described before [ 12 ] . THP - 1 151 cells were seeded onto uncoated coverslips ; DC coverslips were coated 152 with Poly - L - lysine ( Sigma ) . Imaging was performed at room tempera - 153 ture with a Zeiss Axiovert 200M Apotome epi ﬂ uorescence microscope 154 equipped with a cooled CCD Axiocam camera ( Zeiss ×63 1 . 4 - NA 155 Oil Plan - Apochromat objective , Carl Zeiss , Oberkochen Germany ) 156 and Axiovision 4 . 5 software ( Zeiss ) or an Olympus IX81 FluoView 157 1000 confocal laser scanning microscope ( Olympus ×60 1 . 35 - NA 158 Oil UplanSApo objective , Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) with FluoView 159 FV1000 software ( Olympus ) . Z - stacks were taken each 0 . 5 μ m and 160 reconstructed into side views with FluoView FV1000 software 161 ( Olympus ) . 162 2 . 5 . Live cell imaging of podosomes 163 THP - 1 cells were prepared as described earlier [ 24 ] . Time - lapse 164 images were generated using the Olympus confocal microscope ( ac - 165 quisition every 30 s over a period of 30 min in one z plane ) and fur - 166 ther analyzed with ImageJ . For turnover measurements , podosomes 167 were manually tracked and LifeAct intensity values in the podosome 168 were determined over time . All intensities were normalized to the 169 average LifeAct intensity per podosome over time , which was set as 170 100 % . For lifetime measurements , podosomes were categorized ac - 171 cording to the time between ﬁ rst appearance and complete disap - 172 pearance . For determination of podosome size , podosomes were 173 manually encircled and their area was measured . 174 2 . 6 . Actin branching assays 175 Actin branching assays were performed as described earlier [ 28 , 176 29 ] . For fascin , reaction mixtures contained 2 μ M monomeric actin , 177 60 nM Arp2 / 3 , 100 nM GST – VCA ( verprolin , co ﬁ lin , acidic homology 178 domain ) of WASP , 2 μ M fascin and 4 μ M FASNb2 - His 6 - STREP or un - 179 tagged FASNb5 . For cortactin , reaction mixtures contained 2 μ M mo - 180 nomeric actin , 8 nM Arp2 / 3 , 30 nM GST – VCA of WASP , 30 nM 181 cortactin and 60 nM GELNb11 - V5 - His 6 ( anti - gelsolin nanobody ) 182 [ 30 ] or CORNb2 - V5 - His 6 . Nanobodies and their antigens were ﬁ rst 183 pre - incubated for 30 min on ice before addition of the other compo - 184 nents . Samples were further diluted in polymerization buffer 185 ( 10 mM HEPES pH = 7 . 0 , 100 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 and 0 . 1 mM 186 EDTA , 1 mM DTT ) and the reaction was started by addition of 187 0 . 2 mM ATP . Polymerization was performed at room temperature 2 I . Van Audenhove et al . / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta xxx ( 2015 ) xxx – xxx Please cite this article as : I .

THP - 1 macrophages carry podosomes with cortactin in the actin - rich 199 core and fascin in the cap structure 200 To study podosome formation , we used human monocytic leukemia 201 THP - 1 cells [ 31 ] . Treatment with PMA induces differentiation into 202 macrophages coinciding with the formation of adhesion struc - 203 tures [ 32 ] . Vinculin immuno ﬂ uorescence enables discrimination be - 204 tween streak - like focal adhesion patterns at the end of stress ﬁ bers 205 and the ring - like podosome patterns surrounding an actin center 206 ( Fig . 1a ) . Cortactin localizes barely at focal adhesions but is a promi - 207 nent marker of podosomes ( Fig . 1b ) . Although mostly HS1 is linked 208 to hematopoietic cells [ 33 ] , THP - 1 podosomes contain both cortactin 209 and HS1 ( Fig . 1c ) . 210 Fascin localizes both at focal adhesions and podosomes ( Fig . 1d ) . 211 In contrast to cortactin , which is present in the actin - rich podosome 212 core , fascin localizes in an upper cap structure ( Fig . 1e ) . This is in 213 striking contrast with its localization in invadopodia , representing 214 similar structures of proteolytic cell invasion typically present in 215 cancer cells . An invadopodium core is composed of branched actin 216 ( presence of Arp2 and cortactin ) while the protrusive tip is enriched 217 in fascin . In podosomes however , the fascin - rich cap covers the un - 218 derlying branched actin region ( Fig . 1f ) . 219 3 . 2 . Disturbance of fascin actin bundling or the cortactin SH3 domain leads 220 to podosome loss and compensation by focal adhesions in THP - 1 221 macrophages 222 To study fascin and cortactin function , stable inducible cell lines 223 expressing EGFP - tagged fascin or cortactin nanobodies ( K d ~ nM ) 224 were generated . EGFP - only expressing cells serve as negative con - 225 trol . Fascin nanobody 5 ( FASNb5 ) speci ﬁ cally inhibits fascin actin 226 bundling both in vitro and intracellular , while fascin nanobody 2 227 ( FASNb2 ) has no effect [ 12 ] . Cortactin nanobody 2 ( CORNb2 ) specif - 228 ically binds the regulatory SH3 - domain of cortactin [ 12 ] . Also in the 229 THP - 1 cell line , FASNb2 / 5 bind endogenous fascin and CORNb2 230 binds endogenous cortactin , but not HS1 ( Supplementary Fig . 1a , 231 b ) . Colocalization studies in LifeAct – Cherry - expressing macrophages 232 further reveal that fascin nanobodies are often not enriched in 233 podosomes , while the cortactin nanobody intensity mostly coincides 234 with actin pro ﬁ les ( Supplementary Fig . 1c ) . 235 In the presence of FASNb5 or CORNb2 , less cells are capable of 236 forming podosomes ( Fig . 2a ) and podosome numbers per cell are 237 signi ﬁ cantly reduced ( Fig . 2b ) . Note that cell areas were not 238 signi ﬁ cantly different ( median values : control : 873 μ m 2 , FASNb5 : 239 951 μ m 2 , CORNb2 : 914 μ m 2 ) . Complementary with these observa - 240 tions , more FASNb5 and CORNb2 - expressing cells generated focal 241 adhesions ( Fig . 2c ) and focal adhesion numbers per cell were signif - 242 icantly increased ( Fig . 2d , e ) . When observing podosome patterns in 243 more detail , it further appeared that CORNb2 - expressing cells often 244 suffered from disrupted vinculin rings in combination with less dis - 245 crete , rather ‘ fuzzy ’ actin centers ( Fig . 2f , g ) . In conclusion , both 246 FASNb5 and CORNb2 switch the cell adhesion phenotype from 247 podosomes to focal adhesions with CORNb2 additionally disrupting 248 podosome patterns in THP - 1 macrophages . 249 3 . 3 . Fascin actin bundling is essential for podosome turnover and 250 disassembly in THP - 1 macrophages 251 As podosomes are highly dynamic structures [ 33 , 3 ] , we per - 252 formed live cell imaging on LifeAct – Cherry - transduced nanobody - 253 expressing cells . F - actin core turnover occurs several times in indi - 254 vidual podosomes of control , FASNb2 and CORNb2 - expressing cells 255 ( Fig . 3a ) [ 34 ] . In control cells , podosome actin levels ﬂ uctuate from 256 approximately 70 % to 130 % of the average podosome intensity 257 ( which is set at 100 % ) ( Fig . 3b ; Videos 1a , 2a ) . While this is also 258 true for FASNb2 ( Videos 1b , 2b ) and CORNb2 - expressing cells 259 ( Videos 1d , 2d ) , FASNb5 restricts this variation resulting in continu - 260 ously persisting podosomes ( Videos 1c , 2c ) . Thus , the actin intensity 261 variation in podosomes of FASNb5 - expressing cells is signi ﬁ cantly 262 limited ( Fig . 3c ) . 263 We further determined podosome lifetime , which was reported 264 before to be 2 – 12 min [ 3 ] . The most abundant podosome fractions 265 indeed remain maximally 2 min ( short - living ) or 10 min , while 266 only a slight fraction is really long - living ( N 30 min ) ( Fig . 4a ) . While 267 FASNb2 and CORNb2 - dependent distributions are similar to the con - 268 trol , FASNb5 clearly shifts podosome lifetimes , with a signi ﬁ cantly 269 decreased short - living podosome fraction and increased long - living 270 podosome fraction . This further results in boosted podosome dimen - 271 sions ( Fig . 4b , c ) . 272 In conclusion , inhibiting fascin actin bundling by means of FASNb5 273 reduces podosome turnover and disassembly and increases podosome 274 sizes in THP - 1 macrophages . The cortactin SH3 domain on the other 275 hand does not contribute to dynamics in THP - 1 macrophages . 276 3 . 4 . Fascin actin bundling in ﬂ uences the Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin branching 277 process 278 To gain more insight into the mechanism by which fascin pro - 279 motes podosome turnover and disassembly , we performed actin 280 branching assays . In the absence of fascin , Arp2 / 3 and the WASP - 281 VCA domain mediate branching . Upon fascin addition , actin bun - 282 dling occurs as showed before by sedimentation assays and electron 283 microscopy [ 12 ] . This actin bundling activity signi ﬁ cantly inhibits 284 branching ( Fig . 5a ) . FASNb2 has no effect on this phenomenon , 285 while FASNb5 signi ﬁ cantly restores the Arp2 / 3 branching ability . 286 This is in agreement with the inhibitory activity of FASNb5 on fascin 287 actin bundling [ 12 ] . For cortactin , its role in branch stabilization was 288 shown before [ 29 ] . Indeed , more Arp2 / 3 and VCA - mediated 289 branches form in the presence of cortactin ( Fig . 5b ) . CORNb2 howev - 290 er has no effect on this stabilizing property . 291 This observation suggests that FASNb5 counteracts the fascin 292 inhibiting potential on Arp2 / 3 - mediated branching while CORNb2 293 does not affect cortactin - aided branching activity .

Disrupting fascin actin bundling or the cortactin SH3 domain switches 295 degradation from podosome - to focal adhesion - dependent and affects 296 migratory phenotypes in THP - 1 macrophages 297 As it is assumed that podosomes contribute to proteolytic matrix 298 degradation for invasion [ 3 ] , we seeded THP - 1 macrophages onto a 299 ﬂ uorescently labeled gelatin matrix to analyze degradation ( Fig . 6a ) . 300 From this assay , it was clear that especially cells with disrupted vincu - 301 lin – actin patterns fail in degradation ( Fig . 6b ) . Importantly , this assay 302 further revealed that both podosomes and focal adhesions can execute 303 matrix degradation ( Fig . 6c ) . Most of the podosome - dependent 304 degradation is therefore compensated by focal adhesion - dependent 305 degradation in FASNb5 and CORNb2 - expressing cells ( Fig . 6d ) . 306 To contributetotheimmuneresponse , macrophagesmust developa 307 migratory phenotype which is characterized by cell elongation , polari - 308 zation and podosome presence at the leading lamella [ 35 ] . In the pres - 309 ence of FASNb5 or CORNb2 , fewer cells are elongated and they 310 maintain a round morphology ( Fig . 6e , f ) . In FASNb5 - expressing cells 311 we also noticed that podosomes were often homogenously or centrally 312 distributed ratherthanspeci ﬁ callyenrichedattheedgeof cells ( Fig . 6g ) , 313 which can be linked to podosome immobility through perturbing their 314 dynamics .

Primary DC also depend on fascin actin bundling and the cortactin SH3 320 domain for podosome formation and the generation of a migratory 321 phenotype 322 To check the relevance of our THP - 1 macrophage model , we veri ﬁ ed 323 our observations in human blood PBMC - derived dendritic cells ( DC ) . 324 Primary DC also form focal adhesions as well as podosomes ( Supple - 325 mentary Fig . 2 a ) which contain both cortactin and HS1 and the typical 326 fascin - cap ( Supplementary Fig . 2b , c ) . Western blot analysis con ﬁ rmed 327 that cortactin levels are lower in immune cells in comparison to cancer 328 cellswhiletheoppositeistrueforHS1 ( SupplementaryFig . 2d ) . Theblot 329 further revealed comparable fascin levels in THP - cells and immature 330 DC . 331 To verify our nanobody - induced effects , immature DC were 332 transfected with V5 - tagged intrabodies , with GFPNb as negative control 333 ( Fig . 7a ) . FASNb5 and CORNb2 signi ﬁ cantly decreased podosome num - 334 bers ( Fig . 7b ) , whichcoincide with a decline in polarized DC ( Fig . 7c ) . Of 335 note , CORNb2 - expressing cells were signi ﬁ cantly smaller ( median 336 values : control : 345 μ m 2 , FASNb5 : 359 μ m 2 , CORNb2 ⁎⁎⁎ : 270 μ m 2 , ⁎⁎⁎ 337 p b 0 . 001 Mann – Whitney U test ) . This is due to a lack of spreading ca - 338 pacity on the poly - L - lysine coating used , which will also contribute to 339 the decline in podosome and polarized DC numbers . Indeed , podosome 340 numbers normalized to the cell areas are still signi ﬁ cantly but less re - 341 duced in the case of CORNb2 ( ⁎ p b 0 . 05 , Mann – Whitney U test ) . 342 In conclusion , FASNb5 and CORNb2 also disturb podosome forma - 343 tion in primary DC , which are comparable to THP - 1 cells concerning 344 their antigen features . 345 Furthermore , an interesting feature of primary DC is that upon mat - 346 uration , achieved by addition of LPS , fascine levels increase four - fold 347 ( Supplementary Fig . 2e ) . Fascin is therefore a useful maturation marker 348 for DC [ 15 ] . Immature DCarenicely polarized withpodosomes enriched 349 at the front ( Fig . 7d ) . In striking contrast , mature DC with high fascin 350 levels are often devoid of podosomes , rounded and not polarized 351 ( Fig . 7e , f ) . So , also elevated fascin levels are related to podosome loss 352 and a lack of migratory phenotype . 353 4 . Discussion 354 4 . 1 . Role of fascin actin bundling in podosome dynamics and disassembly 355 Our experiments with FASNb5 unravel a mechanism as represented 356 in Fig . 8 . Podosome building blocks are in a constant equilibrium be - 357 tween Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin branching and fascin - mediated actin 358 bundling . Emphasisis on branchingupon assembly , enablingpodosome 359 growth . Fascin activity results in loss of branches in the protrusive tip 360 and force generation by bundles on top , permitting turnover and disas - 361 sembly . This process generates building blocks for new podosomes . Fig . 4 .

Lack of constituents and / or initiation points may be the 364 cause . Indeed , podosomes are believed to arise from focal adhesion dis - 365 assembly [ 36 ] and it was recently reported that fascin - depleted focal 366 adhesions have prolonged lifetime and less dynamics [ 37 ] . This may 367 also explain why an assembling role of fascin was suggested before 368 [ 13 ] , although the broad targeting technique ( microRNA ) has to be 369 considered also . 370 Our results are in line with the observation that high fascin levels 371 are responsible for podosome disassembly upon DC maturation [ 14 ] , 372 which we propose to extend into a more general fascin function in 373 podosome dynamics dependent on its expression levels . In imma - 374 ture DC and THP - 1 cells with comparably low fascin levels , bundling 375 inhibition disturbs its regulatory activity in podosome dynamics . 376 Mature DC on the other hand , having high fascin levels , lose the 377 ability to form podosomes [ 38 , 39 ] . The exaggerated fascin bundling 378 potential limits branching to the extent that podosome onset can 379 simply not occur , possibly also by preventing binding of other actin 380 regulators . Lowering fascin levels in mature DC would therefore pro - 381 mote podosome formation [ 14 ] . 382 Another fascinating consideration is that fascin actin bundling has a 383 contrastingroleinpodosomesversusinvadopodia . Cancercellsexpress - 384 ing FASNb5 showed reduced invadopodium lifetimes while formation 385 itself was not affected [ 12 ] . This may be explained by the different 386 actin arrangements in invadopodia versus podosomes ( Fig . 1f ) . 387 Invadopodia are generated by a dendritic actin network at the base , 388 while elongation occurs upon extension of bundled actin ﬁ bers at the 389 tip , partly by fascin [ 40 , 11 ] . As podosomes are less protrusive , they 390 just grow by expanding their branching - based core , with bundling ac - 391 tivity controlling on top of the structure [ 41 , 4 ] .

However , there 396 was no direct link with bundling activity , but rather with interaction 397 partners [ 42 ] , other actin regulations [ 43 ] or phosphorylation [ 44 ] . Fur - 398 thermore , inhibition of L - plastin bundling decreased podosome lifetime 399 and led to structural defects [ 24 ] . Thus , fascin bundling - induced 400 podosome disassembly is quite unique . Indeed , L - plastin will rather 401 form bundles onto existing branches [ 45 ] and therefore contribute to 402 podosome assembly and stability . Additionally , co ﬁ lin may account for 403 the differences as its severing is enhanced in fascin - crosslinks [ 46 ] , but 404 reduced in bundles generated by formins and villins [ 47 , 48 ] . 405 Altogether our observations point to a unique role of fascin bundling 406 in podosomes of THP - 1 macrophages and DC which is mechanistically 407 different from other bundling proteins or other protrusions such as 408 invadopodia . 409 4 . 2 . Role of the cortactin SH3 domain in podosome assembly and structural 410 integrity 411 Our results point to a role of the cortactin SH3 domain in podosome 412 assembly . This is in agreement with previous reports on cortactin pres - 413 ence prior to actin at podosome initiation sites [ 36 , 49 ] . As cortactin , 414 lacking a functional SH3 domain , fails in being recruited towards those 415 sites [ 49 ] , it is likely that CORNb2 affects this initial cluster formation 416 which is the scaffold for actin assembly and thus podosome formation . 417 Effects on podosome structure integrity were reported previously 418 in HS1 de ﬁ cient [ 20 ] and WIP de ﬁ cient DC [ 50 , 51 ] . Our results pin - 419 point this defect to the cortactin SH3 domain . More particular , we 420 showed before that WIP and cortactin recruitment towards the plas - 421 ma membrane of CORNb2 - expressing breast cancer cells was re - 422 duced , while DynaminII and WASP remained unaffected [ 12 ] . This 423 suggests that disturbed cortactin - WIP recruitment and / or interac - 424 tion accounts for disrupted podosome structures . This is in agree - 425 ment with the observation that DC expressing WIP without the 426 cortactin interaction domain also carry disrupted podosomes [ 50 ] . 427 The cortactin SH3 domain similarly contributes to assembly and 428 structure in cancer cell invadopodia [ 12 ] . However , CORNb2 there also 429 reduced matrix degradation activity . This may be masked in THP - 1 430 cells due to the compensation by proteolytic focal adhesions . 431 Intriguingis thenon - redundant role of cortactin nextto HS1 in mac - 432 rophages and DC . It was shown before that both are expressed in mega - 433 karyocytes , platelets and osteoclasts [ 52 – 54 ] . In macrophages and DC 434 however , some report only the presence of HS1 [ 20 , 21 ] , while we and 435 others observe expression of both proteins [ 50 , 51 ] . Functionally , HS1 436 is a weaker actin nucleator and branch mediator compared to cortactin 437 [ 29 ] . Furthermore , phosphorylation can occur at different sites , HS1 has 438 a nuclear localization signal while cortactin does not , and their SH3 do - 439 maincanbinddifferentproteinsdespitetheaminoacidsimilarityof86 % 440 [ 33 ] . Thus , our data con ﬁ rms the idea that cortactin and HS1 expression 441 in myeloid cells is not redundant and that they may be functionally 442 more distinct then assumed Q4 . By comparison , hematopoietic WASP and 443 ubiquitous N - WASP are also both necessary in macrophage podosome 444 formation [ 55 ] . Fig . 8 .

Effect ofpodosome - loss onfocaladhesions , matrixdegradation and mi - 450 gratory phenotype 451 For both fascin and cortactin nanobodies , podosome - loss was com - 452 pensated for by focal adhesions , which are less dynamic [ 56 ] . This 453 switch was observed before and is believed to help immune cells in 454 modulating adhesion and migratory potential [ 51 , 57 ] . In our case , the 455 focal adhesions also helped to retain degradation capacity in THP - 1 456 macrophages . Although focal adhesions have long been considered as 457 non - proteolytic , recent data showed their extracellular matrix degrada - 458 tion capacity next to proteolytic invadopodia [ 58 , 59 ] . Our data shows 459 that focal adhesion - dependent degradation can also occur next to 460 podosomal degradation in immune cells ( Fig . 6c ) . 461 The focaladhesionscouldhowevernotpreventaneffectonmigrato - 462 ry phenotype development . Chemotaxis was shown before to be linked 463 to podosomes [ 8 , 5 ] , which typically assemble at the leading edge [ 35 ] . 464 Thus , both nanobodies might result in impaired migration , although 465 this is more likely for FASNb5 , as we also observed reduced podosome 466 translocation towards the cell sides ( Fig . 6g ) . 467 Thus , both nanobodies affect the adhesive , degrading and migratory 468 phenotype due to podosome - loss . 469 4 . 4 . Conclusions 470 Insummary , ourstudyrevealedthedisassemblingroleoffascinbun - 471 dling and the assembling role of the cortactin SH3 domain during 472 podosome lifetime in THP - 1 macrophages and DC . We discovered the 473 particular cap - like localization of fascin and provided insight into a 474 strikingly opposite role in podosomesversusinvadopodia . For cortactin , 475 we unveiled its non - redundant role next to HS1 in THP - 1 macrophages 476 andDC .
