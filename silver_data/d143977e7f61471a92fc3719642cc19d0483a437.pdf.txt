GPI - PLC ( glycosylphosphatidylinositol - speciﬁc phospholipase C ) is expressed in bloodstream - form Trypanosoma brucei , a protozoan that causes human African trypanosomiasis . Loss of genes encoding GPI - PLC reduces the virulence of a pleomorphic strain of the parasite , for reasons that are not clear . In the present paper , we report that GPI - PLC stimulates endocytosis of transferrin by 300 – 500 % . Surprisingly , GPI - PLC is not de - tected at endosomes , suggesting that the enzyme does not interact directly with the endosomal machinery . We therefore hypothesized that a diffusible product of the GPI - PLC enzyme reaction [ possibly DAG ( diacylglycerol ) ] mediated the biological effects of the protein . Two sets of data support this assertion . First , a catalytically inactive Q81L mutant of GPI - PLC , expressed in a GPI - PLC - null background , had no effect on endocytosis , indicating that enzyme activity is essential for the protein to stimulate endocytosis . Secondly , the exogenous DAGs OAG ( 1 - oleyl - 2 - acetyl - sn - glycerol ) and DMG ( dimyristoylglycerol ) independently stimulated endocytosis of transferrin . Furthermore , the DAG mimic PMA , a phorbol ester , also activated endocytosis in T . brucei . DAG - stimulated endocytosis is a novel pathway in the trypanosome . We surmise that ( i ) GPI - PLC regulates transferrin endocytosis in T . brucei , ( ii ) GPI - PLC is a signalling enzyme , and ( iii ) DAG is a second messenger for GPI - PLC . We propose that regulation of endocytosis is a physiological function of GPI - PLC in bloodstream T . brucei . Key words : diacylglycerol ( DAG ) , endocytosis , glycosylphos - phatidylinositol - speciﬁc phospholipase C ( GPI - PLC ) , signalling , transferrin , Trypanosoma brucei . INTRODUCTION Endocytosis in eukaryotes is important for uptake of some nutrients ( e . g . iron , and cholesterol esters ) , maintenance of cell volume and for modulation of cell signalling ( reviewed in [ 1 ] ) . Lipids ( e . g . polyphosphoinositides ) regulate various steps of endocytosis . DAG ( diacylglycerol ) is an intracellular second messenger that can be produced by phospholipases C . Phorbol esters ( e . g . PMA ) mimic the biological actions of DAG [ 2 ] , and are frequently used in biochemical studies of DAG signalling . Trypanosoma brucei resides in blood and lymphatic tissue , and causes human African trypanosomiasis . As an extracellular parasite , T . brucei depends on endocytosis to take up some nutrients from host blood [ 3 , 4 ] . For example , transferrin , which is essential for the acquisition of iron by the parasite , is endocytosed by a unique receptor [ 4 – 6 ] . Endocytosis is also important for clearing of anti - parasite antibody from the plasma membrane of T . brucei [ 7 ] . The presence of anti - parasite antibody on the plasma membrane may lead to phagocytosis and killing of the tryp - anosome by macrophages [ 7 ] . Endocytosis is essential for viability and , by extension , virulence of T . brucei [ 8 , 9 ] . In contrast with its beneﬁcial effects on the physiology of T . brucei , endocytosis of a host - derived anti - parasite toxin ( e . g . trypanosome lytic factor or tumour necrosis factor ) can kill the parasite ( reviewed in [ 10 , 11 ] ) . Therefore survival of the parasite in host blood probably requires a delicate balance of endocytic pathways . Whereas studies of the core endocytosis machinery are being pursued ( reviewed in [ 12 ] ) , little is known about small - molecule regulators of the pathway in T . brucei . GPI - PLC [ GPI ( glycosylphosphatidylinositol ) - speciﬁc phos - pholipase C ] is expressed speciﬁcally in bloodstream T . brucei , which can differentiate to insect stage ( procyclic ) cells . During transformation of the parasite , GPI - PLC contributes to the release of VSG ( variant surface glycoprotein ) from the plasma membrane of the parasite [ 13 , 14 ] , although the bulk of the enzyme has not been localized to the plasma membrane [ 15 ] . In non - differentiating bloodstream - form T . brucei , GPI - PLC is a virulence factor . In a mouse model of human African trypano - somiasis , theenzymecontributestothevirulenceofapleomorphic strain of T . brucei [ 16 ] . In the present paper , we report a new physiological function of GPI - PLC as a signalling enzyme that stimulates endocytosis in T . brucei . Furthermore , we demonstrate that exogenously added DAG modulates endocytosis in the parasite . DAG - regulated endocytosis is a novel pathway in T . brucei . We surmise that the importance of GPI - PLC in the virulence of T . brucei involves its contributions to the endocytosis of transferrin , a growth factor for the parasite [ 17 ] .

PMA , its analogue 4 α - PMA and all other reagents were from Sigma . Plasmid construction The GPI - PLC expression plasmid pLew - GPIPLC was obtained by insertion of a GPI - PLC coding region ( from pUTK - GPIPLC [ 20 , 21 ] ) into a T . brucei expression plasmid pLew82 in place of a luciferase gene [ 22 ] . The GPI - PLC DNA insert was generated by PCR using a lz - acc KCR4 forward primer ( 5 (cid:2) - TAAAAGC - TTTTAACACAGGAGGCAGACCATGTTTGGTGGT - 3 (cid:2) ) and KCR5 reverse primer ( 5 (cid:2) - TATGTGGATCCTTATGACCTTGC - GGTTTGGTT - 3 (cid:2) ) , with pUTK - GPIPLC as a template [ 21 , 23 ] . The PCR product was digested with BamHI and HindIII , gel - puriﬁed , ligatedintopLew82 [ 22 ] andtransfectedinto Escherichia coli XL10 cells . DNA encoding a Q81L mutant of GPI - PLC ( Q81L _ GPIPLC ) was excised from pUTK constructs [ 21 ] and subcloned into pLew82 . DNA transfection of a mutant GPI - PLC − / − T . bruceistrain Bloodstream form T . brucei RUMP528 ( GPI - PLC − / − ) was refractory to transformation using standard procedures . To trans - fect DNA into T . brucei RUMP528 , major modiﬁcations of pub - lished protocols were implemented . Cells were grown to a density of 2 × 10 6 cells / ml , centrifuged at 5000 g for 5 min at room tem - perature ( 22 ◦ C ) , washed once with PBS ( 136 mM NaCl , 27 mM KCl , 5 . 3 mM Na 2 HPO 4 and 1 . 7 mM KH 2 PO 4 ) , and washed once with Cytomix . The cell pellet was resuspended in 400 μ l of Cytomix to a ﬁnal density of 2 . 5 × 10 8 cells / ml . Plasmid DNA ( 100 μ g ) that had been puriﬁed using Qiagen - tip 500 gravity - ﬂow columns ( Qiagen ) , linearized with NotI and dissolved in 100 μ l of TE ( 10 mM Tris / HCl and 1 mM EDTA , pH 8 . 0 ) was added to the cell suspension . Cells were electroporated in 4 - mm - pathlength cuvettes with a Bio - Rad Gene Pulser II at 1 . 6 kV , 50 μ F timing and 360 (cid:3) . Cells were cloned immediately after electroporation as follows : from the electroporated cell suspension , 170 , 17 or 2 μ l was added to 12 ml of pre - warmed HMI - 9 medium in 75 cm 2 culture ﬂasks . Hygromycin ( 5 μ g / ml , ﬁnal concentration ) and G418 ( 2 . 5 μ g / ml , ﬁnal concentration ) were added to the three ﬂasks , which were incubated for 16 h at 37 ◦ C before phleomycin ( ﬁnal concentration of 1 μ g / ml ) was added . Each diluted cell suspension was divided into 24 - well plates ( 1 ml / well ) and incubated at 37 ◦ C for 1 – 2 weeks . Only cell lines obtained from dilutions that yielded less than eight wells ( out of 24 ) with parasites were propagated . Stable transfectants were maintained in HMI - 9 medium containing all three antibiotics ( above ) . During passage , cells that reached late - exponential phase ( 2 × 10 6 cells / ml ) were diluted back to 2 × 10 4 cells / ml in HMI - 9 medium . GPI - PLC enzyme assay T . brucei expressing various GPI - PLC mutants were induced for 16 h with tetracycline ( 1 μ g / ml ) , harvested ( 10 7 cells ) and washed once with PBS . The cell pellet was lysed in 200 μ l of HLB ( hypotonic lysis buffer ) ( 10 mM sodium phosphate and 1 mM EDTA , pH 8 . 0 ) containing protease inhibitors [ 2 . 1 mM leupeptin , 0 . 1 mM tosyl - lysylchloromethane ( ‘TLCK’ ) and 0 . 4 unit of aprotinin ] . This lysate was incubated for 20 min on ice and centrifuged at 14000 g for 20 min at 4 ◦ C . The pellet was solubilized in 100 μ l of AB ( assay buffer ; 1 % NP40 , 5 mM EDTA and 50 mM Tris / HCl , pH 8 . 0 ) . Then , 5 μ l of the above detergent extract was added to 25 μ l of AB containing 2 μ g of 3 H - labelled membrane - form VSG on ice . The mixture was incubated at 37 ◦ C for 15 min , before the [ 3 H ] dimyristoylglycerol released from 3 H - labelled membrane - form VSG was extracted with water - saturated n - butanol and quantiﬁed by scintillation counting . Protein concentration of cell lysates was determined using a BCA assay . Fluorescence microscopy The reagents and methods used to detect intracellular GPI - PLC and endocytosed ﬂuorescent transferrin were as described in [ 15 , 20 ] . Endosomal compartments were identiﬁed after uptake of the ﬂuorescent marker FM4 - 64 . For endocytosis , cells at a density of 10 6 / ml were pelleted gently by centrifugation at 2000 g for 2 min and resuspended in 500 μ l of serum - free HMI - 9 medium containing 10 μ M FM4 - 64 . Cells were incubated at 37 ◦ C for 10 min before ﬁxation , permeabilization and visualization ( see below ) . Exponential - phase cells ( 10 6 / ml ) were harvested , washed once with PBS ( pH 7 . 4 ) and ﬁxed in paraformaldehyde ( 400 μ l of a 2 % solution in PBS ) for 8 min on ice , before being quenched with 1 ml of 0 . 5 M glycine in PBS for 5 min at room temperature . Cells were washed once in PBS , settled on poly - L - lysine - coated coverslips for 30 min , permeabilized with methanol ( pre - chilled at − 20 ◦ C ) for 2 min at 4 ◦ C and washed twice with PBS . Non - speciﬁc protein - adsorption sites were blocked with 1 % ( w / v ) BSA in PBS for 30 min at room temperature . To detect GPI - PLC , anti - GPI - PLC monoclonal antibody 2A6 - 6 [ 24 ] ( 100 μ l of a 1 : 1500 dilution in blocking solution ) was used . In order to reduce the background from non - speciﬁc antibody adsorption , 2A6 - 6 ( 150 μ l of a 1 : 1200 dilution ) was pre - adsorbed on coverslips containing ﬁxed and permeabilized T . brucei RUMP528 cells ( GPI - PLC − / − ) for 15 min at room temperature . The coverslips were removed carefully , and the pre - adsorbed antibody solution was recovered for GPI - PLC detection . Cells were incubated with the pre - absorbed primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature and washed as follows : once with PBS , twice with high - salt buffer ( PBS containing 500 mM NaCl ) and twice with PBS . The cells were then incubated with Alexa Fluor ® 594 - conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG ( 200 μ l of a 1 : 2000 dilution ) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark . Coverslips were washed twice with PBS before mounting on slides . The cell nucleus and kinetoplast ( mitochondrial ) DNA were stained with 10 μ M DAPI ( 4 (cid:2) , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ) in c (cid:3) The Authors Journal compilation c (cid:3) 2009 Biochemical Society Glycosylphosphatidylinositol - speciﬁc phospholipase C 687 CitiFluor anti - fade reagent ( CitiFluor Ltd ) . Cells were viewed with a ﬂuorescence microscope ( Leica DMIRBE ) . Images were captured with an interline chip - cooled CCD ( charge - coupled device ) camera ( Orca 9545 ; Hamamatsu ) and processed with Openlab 3 . 1 . 2 software ( Improvision ) . SDS / PAGE and Western blotting To detect GPI - PLC , an aliquot ( 10 μ l ) of solubilized membrane fractions ( from 10 7 cells ) was heated at 90 ◦ C for 2 min after the addition of an equal volume of 2 . 5 × SDS / PAGE sample buffer [ 25 % ( v / v ) glycerol , 5 % ( w / v ) SDS , 5 % ( v / v ) 2 - mercaptoethanol , 0 . 05 % Bromophenol Blue and 0 . 05 M Tris / HCl , pH 6 . 8 ] . Total membrane proteins were resolved by SDS / PAGE ( 12 % minigel ) , and electrotransferred on to Immobilon P using a Trans - Blot SD Semi - Dry Transfer Cell ( Bio - Rad ) . GPI - PLC on Immobilon P was detected by Western blotting with anti - GPI - PLC ( R18B3 ) antibody [ 20 ] . Enzyme - linked secondary antibody was detected with BCIP and NBT . TfR ( transferrin receptor ) Western blotting was performed as follows . Bloodstream - form T . brucei 427 ( GPI - PLC + / + ) or T . brucei RUMP528 ( GPI - PLC − / − ) were pelleted and lysed in 3 × SDS / PAGE sample buffer . Proteins in 2 × 10 6 cell equivalents ( per lane ) were resolved by SDS / PAGE ( 14 % gels ) , transferred on to Immobilon P membrane and blocked with 5 % ( w / v ) non - fat dried skimmed milk powder and 0 . 1 % Tween 20 in PBS . The membrane was incubated with anti - TfR antibody ( diluted 1 : 10000 ) [ 6 ] followed by goat anti - rabbit antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase ( diluted 1 : 1000 ) , after which colour was developed with BCIP / NBT staining . In a control experiment , T . brucei BiP ( immunoglobulin heavy - chain - binding protein ) was detected using a similar protocol except that anti - BiP antibody ( a gift from Professor Jay Bangs , Medical Microbiology and Immunology , UniversityofWisconsin , Madison , WI , U . S . A . ) [ 25 ] was used with 2 × 10 5 cell equivalents of protein per lane . Endocytosis assays For internalization of dextran – Texas Red or transferrin – Alexa Fluor ® 594 , bloodstream - form T . brucei was cultured to a density of 10 6 cells / ml . Cells ( 5 × 10 7 ) were pelleted , rinsed with buffer containing BBS / G ( bicine - buffered saline with glucose : 50 mM bicine , 50 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl and 1 % glucose , pH 7 . 4 ) , and centrifuged at 1400 g for 5 min at room temperature . The cell pellet was resuspended in ice - cold serum - free IMDM ( Iscove’s modiﬁed Dulbecco’s medium ) , and the cell suspension was stored on ice for 10 min . Dextran – Texas Red was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 10 μ g / ml , and the cell suspension was incubated at 37 ◦ C . Transferrin – Alexa Fluor ® 594 was added at 25 μ g / ml ( ﬁnal concentration ) . At different time intervals , aliquots of cells ( 5 × 10 6 ) were withdrawn and pelleted at 5000 g for 5 min at 4 ◦ C . The supernatant was discarded , and the cell pellet was washed ﬁve times with ice - cold BBS / G containing 2 % ( w / v ) sodium azide ( 5000 g for 3 min at 4 ◦ C ) . The ﬁnal pellet was resuspended in 100 μ l of the same buffer ( ice - cold ) and deposited into 96 - well plates that were kept on ice at all times . Fluorescence of the resuspended cells was measured with a ﬂuorimeter ( Fluostar Galaxy , BMG Labtech ) , with excitation at 594 nm and emission at 612 nm . The instrument was initially set to measure the maximum gain in all wells of the 96 - well plate to determine the peak ﬂuorescence . Fluorescence in RFU ( relative ﬂuorescence units ) was read against a blank that consisted of cells that did not receive the ﬂuorescent endocytosis cargo . Values determined for the blank were subtracted from readings of the experimental samples , before plotting the RFU for each sample . Each set of assays was performed in triplicate . Each set of data was repeated multiple times with similar results , a representative of which is presented in the Figures . Endocytic membrane recycling assay with FM4 - 64 Tomonitormembranerecyclingwithintheexo / endo - cyticsystem , T . brucei 427 ( wild - type ) and T . brucei RUMP528 ( GPI - PLC − / − ) were harvested and washed once with BBS / G . FM4 - 64 ( 10 μ M ﬁnal concentration ) was added to cells in 1 ml of ice - cold serum - free IMDM . After incubation for 30 min at 37 ◦ C to allow internalization of the dye , cells ( 2 × 10 6 ) were washed once in BBS / G at 4 ◦ C and incubated at 37 ◦ C . At speciﬁed time intervals , aliquots ( containing 4 × 10 6 cells ) were washed once in BBS / G and centrifuged at 5000 g for 5 min at 4 ◦ C , and the supernatant was saved . To the supernatant , CHAPS was added ( ﬁnal concentration of 1 % ) . The cell pellet was washed three times and resuspended in 100 μ l of BBS / G . FM4 - 64 ﬂuorescence associated with cells or released into the medium was quantiﬁed with a ﬂuorimeter ( excitation at 520 nm and emission at 670 nm ) . Each data point was acquired in triplicate . RFU were obtained as described for endocytosis assays ( above ) . This protocol was mod - iﬁed from an assay developed by Riezman and colleagues [ 26 ] . RESULTS Transferrin endocytosis assay : the effect of metabolic poisons We monitored a biological function of GPI - PLC in T . brucei by quantifying cell - associated transferrin . For this reason , it was important to evaluate whether or not the binding of transferrin to the parasite resulted in endocytosis of the ligand . In general , endocytosis is an energy - requiring cellular process . Therefore we envisaged that interference with energy metabolism in T . brucei would inhibit the endocytosis of transferrin . Bloodstream T . brucei relies almost exclusively on glycolysis for energy production . 2 - Deoxyglucose antagonizes glucose metabolism [ 27 ] . Sodium azide is a metabolic poison [ 28 , 29 ] that kills T . brucei [ 30 ] . Therefore we used 2 - deoxyglucose and sodium azide independently to evaluate the energy - dependence of transferrin uptake . Finally , we tested ( at the single - cell level ) whether cell - associated transferrin was intracellular and could be co - localized with lysosomes , the terminal station of the endocytic pathway . Uptake of transferrin was blocked by both sodium azide ( Fig - ure 1A ) and 2 - deoxyglucose ( Figure 1B ) , indicating that endo - cytosis of the ligand was energy - dependent . Thus transferrin was not merely associating with its receptor on the plasma membrane , because binding of transferrin to its receptor does not require energy . Internalization of transferrin was conﬁrmed in single - cell assays in which the intracellular movement of the ligand was tracked microscopically in a time - course study . At early times ( i . e . less than 10 min ) after addition of transferrin to the parasite , the ligand was associated with intracellular structures , presumably endosomes , found between the nucleus and the kinetoplast ; transferrin was not concentrated on the plasma membrane and did not co - localize with the lysosome ( identiﬁed with anti - p67 antibody ) . At 15 min and later , most of the transferrin co - localized with p67 ( Figure 1C ) , signifying delivery of the ligand to the lysosome . In conclusion , our endocytosis assay quantiﬁes energy - dependent internalization of transferrin into the endolysosomal system of T . brucei . GPI - PLC activates transferrin endocytosis in T . brucei The physiological functions of GPI - PLC in rapidly dividing ( i . e . non - differentiating ) bloodstream T . brucei are not resolved [ 15 ] . c (cid:3) The Authors Journal compilation c (cid:3) 2009 Biochemical Society 688 S . Subramanya and others Figure 1 Sodium azide and 2 - deoxyglucose inhibit the endocytosis of transferrin ( A ) Effect of sodium azide on endocytosis of transferrin . Bloodstream - form T . brucei427 was incubated in PBS containing sodium azide ( 0 . 03mM ) for 15min at 37 ◦ C ( control cells were treated with 1 × PBS ) . Subsequently , cells were incubated with transferrin – Alexa Fluor ® 594 at 37 ◦ C for the times indicated . After speciﬁed periods , cells ( 5 × 10 6 ) were washed with 1 × BBS / G containing 0 . 03mM sodium azide , and the ﬂuorescence of cells was measured ( excitation at 570nm and emission at 620nm ) .

DNA ( nuclear ; n ) and mitochondrial ( kinetoplast ; k ) were detected by staining with DAPI ( blue ) . DAG is a product of GPI - PLC cleavage of GPIs or PtdIns . In vertebrate cells , DAG can regulate endocytosis [ 31 , 32 ] . We therefore tested whether GPI - PLC inﬂuenced endocytosis in T . brucei . In initial experiments , we used two strains : T . brucei Figure 2 GPI - PLC stimulates endocytosis in T . brucei ( A ) Endocytosis of transferrin . Bloodstream - form T . brucei 427 ( GPI - PLC + / + ) or T . brucei RUMP528 ( GPI - PLC − / − ) was incubated with transferrin – Alexa Fluor ® 594 . At the times indicated , cells ( 5 × 10 6 ) were washed with 1 × BBS / G containing 0 . 03mM sodium azide . Fluorescence of cells was measured ( excitation at 570nm and emission at 620nm ) . Results are means + − S . D . ( n = 6 ) . ( B ) TfR is not reduced in GPI - PLC − / − T . brucei . T . bruceiTfR ( the ESAG6 – ESAG7 complex ) was detected by Western blotting with anti - TfR antibody . The typical pattern of heterogeneously glycosylated ESAG6 and ESAG7 is observed in both wild - type and RUMP528T . brucei . In control experiments , BiP was detected as a protein - loading control . The position of a 70kDa protein is indicated . 427 that expresses GPI - PLC , and T . brucei RUMP528 , which lacks GPI - PLC genes [ 18 , 33 ] . Receptor - mediated endocytosis of transferrin was quantiﬁed in the parasites . Parental T . brucei 427 accumulated up to 5 - fold more transferrin than T . brucei RUMP528 ( GPI - PLC − / − ) ( Figure 2A ) . We tested a hypothesis that decreased endocytosis in T . brucei RUMP528 ( GPI - PLC − / − ) cells resulted from a reduction in the amount of TfR , comprising ESAG ( expression - site - associated gene ) 6 and ESAG7 proteins [ 6 , 34 , 35 ] . In Western blot assays , no signiﬁcant difference was observed in the amount of ESAG6 and ESAG7 between wild - type T . brucei and the GPI - PLC - deﬁcient T . brucei RUMP528 cell lines ( Figure 2B ) . This result implies that the amount of TfR in both cell lines is the same . Therefore the deﬁciency in transferrin endocytosis of T . brucei RUMP528 ( Figure 2A ) is not explained by the loss of TfR in T . brucei RUMP528 . General membrane endocytosis and exocytosis is not affected by GPI - PLC Decreased accumulation of transferrin in T . brucei RUMP528 ( GPI - PLC − / − ) ( Figure 2 ) could be explained in two other ways . c (cid:3) The Authors Journal compilation c (cid:3) 2009 Biochemical Society Glycosylphosphatidylinositol - speciﬁc phospholipase C 689 First , the rate of transferrin uptake in T . brucei RUMP528 may be lower compared with parental T . brucei 427 . Alternatively , a higher rate of exocytosis in T . brucei RUMP528 , compared with parental T . brucei 427 , could decrease the amount of transferrin that accumulates in the mutant T . brucei . To distinguish between these possibilities , we tested whether exocytosis of membranes differed between T . brucei 427 and T . brucei RUMP528 . The ﬂuorescent dye FM4 - 64 has been used to study recycling of the plasma membrane in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in neurons [ 26 , 36 ] . At low temperatures , the dye adsorbs to the plasma membrane , which is endocytosed when cells are warmed . Exocytosis of membranes can be evaluated by monitoring the release of FM4 - 64 into the external medium after pre - loading cells with the dye . We ﬁrst compared the relative extents of plasma membrane internalization in T . brucei 427 and T . brucei RUMP528 by pre - loading the cells with FM4 - 64 , washing the parasites and quantifying cell - associated ﬂuorescence . Microscopic examina - tion showed that the dye was present in intracellular vesicles in both strains of T . brucei ( results not shown ; see Figure 4A for an example ) . Quantitatively , accumulation of FM4 - 64 was not signi - ﬁcantly different between T . brucei 427 and T . brucei RUMP528 ( Figure 3A ) . Therefore the rates of bulk plasma membrane internalization cannot explain the different amounts of transferrin that accumulate in the two strains of T . brucei ( Figure 2A ) . To determine whether exocytosis is affected by loss of the GPI - PLC gene , T . brucei RUMP528 and 427 were ﬁrst allowed to endocytose FM4 - 64 . Cells were washed and ‘chased’ in medium lacking FM4 - 64 , after which ( i ) cell - associated FM4 - 64 , and ( ii ) dye exocytosed into the extracellular medium was quantiﬁed . During the ‘chase’ , similar ( relative ) amounts of FM4 - 64 were lost from the two strains of T . brucei ( Figure 3B ) . Furthermore , the two strains of T . brucei exocytosed similar amounts of FM4 - 64 into the culture medium ( Figure 3C ) . These results suggest that general exocytosis is not affected by GPI - PLC . Therefore the difference in transferrin retention between T . brucei 427 and T . brucei RUMP528 is not the result of aberrant exocytosis by the mutant cells . GPI - PLC is not associated with endosomes , and its enzyme activity is important for stimulating uptake of transferrin Two general models may be proposed for how GPI - PLC affects endocytosis in T . brucei . First , the polypeptide itself could act stoichiometrically , by analogy to adaptor proteins or clathrin , to activate the activities of endocytic vesicles . Secondly , GPI - PLC might produce a second messenger which modulates endocytosis , since one product of the enzyme’s reaction is DAG , a well - known second messenger . In an initial test of the ﬁrst hypothesis ( above ) , we determined whether ( or not ) GPI - PLC was an endosome protein in T . brucei . For this purpose , endosomes were marked with the ﬂuorescent dye FM4 - 64 , while GPI - PLC was detected with anti - GPI - PLC antibody in the same cells . GPI - PLC did not co - localize with FM4 - 64 vesicles ( Figure 4A ) , indicating that the enzyme was not endosomal . This conclusion was conﬁrmed in studies with dextran – Texas Red , a marker of ﬂuid - phase endocytosis . GPI - PLC does not co - localize with endocytosed dextran – Texas Red ( Figure 4B ) . Thus GPI - PLC is not an endosomal protein . In order to test our ‘second - messenger hypothesis’ ( see above ) , it was important to have an experimental setup with which to express mutant forms of GPI - PLC in bloodstream - form T . brucei so that their effects on endocytosis could be measured without interference from endogenous enzyme activity . A GPI - PLC − / − mutant ( T . brucei RUMP528 ) was the ideal genetic background Figure 3 Exocytosis of FM4 - 64 in wild - type and GPI - PLC − / − T . brucei ( A ) Uptake of FM4 - 64 .

Subramanya and others Figure 4 Immunodetection of GPI - PLC in T . brucei ( A ) GPI - PLC is not detected on early endosomes labelled with FM4 - 64 . Endosomes in T . brucei were labelled by uptake of FM4 - 64 for 10min . Afterwards , cells were ﬁxed and permeabilized , and GPI - PLC was detected with monoclonal antibody 2A6 - 6 and ﬂuorescent anti - mouse secondary antibody , and visualized by ﬂuorescence microscopy . Cellular [ nuclear ( n ) and kinetoplast ( k ) ( mitochondrial ) ] DNA was detected with DAPI staining . ( B ) GPI - PLC does not associate with endocytic vesicles containing dextran – Texas Red ( Dextran - TR ) . Mutant ( GPI - PLC − / − ) and wild - type ( GPI - PLC + / + ) T . bruceiwere allowed to endocytose dextran – Texas Red for 10min . The cells were ﬁxed and permeabilized , and GPI - PLC was detected with antibody as described in ( A ) . Parasite DNA was detected with DAPI as in ( A ) . in T . brucei RUMP528 ( GPI - PLC − / − ) can be ameliorated by expression of an ectopic copy of the GPI - PLC gene in the GPI - PLC − / − cells . ( Higher background endocytosis in the uninduced cells is most likely to be the result of leaky transcription of GPI - PLC at the ribosomal DNA locus , as has been reported by other groups [ 37 , 38 ] . ) We checked whether enzyme activity was important for the effect of GPI - PLC on endocytosis . Genes for unmutated GPI - PLC or an enzymatically inactive Q81L _ GPIPLC mutant [ 21 ] were expressed in T . brucei RUMP528 . Transcription of the gene for the normal or Q81L mutant GPI - PLC was induced with tetracycline , and endocytosis of transferrin was quantiﬁed . For the ectopic unmutated GPI - PLC , induction of enzyme synthesis enhanced endocytosis ( 3 - fold maximal ) ( Figure 5B ) compared with cells lacking the protein ( i . e . T . brucei RUMP528 ) . The Q81L _ GPIPLC mutant failed to activate endocytosis after induction of its synthesis with tetracycline ( Figure 5B ) , suggesting that GPI - PLC activity was important for stimulation of transferrin endocytosis . However , a trivial explanation for these data would be that the mutant protein was unstable in vivo . To test this theory , immunoblotting assays were performed , and the data showed that the Q81L _ GPIPLC polypeptide was present in T . brucei RUMP528 cells engineered to express the protein ( Figure 5C ) , as was a ( positive ) control protein VSG221 . However , no GPI - PLC enzyme activity was detected with Q81L _ GPIPLC ( Figure 5D ) [ 21 ] . These data indicate that enzyme activity is required for GPI - PLC to stimulate endocytosis of transferrin . Phorbol ester and DAGs enhance endocytosis in T . brucei Since enzyme activity of GPI - PLC is required for its stimulation of transferrin endocytosis ( Figures 5A and 5B ) , we hypothesized that a product of GPI ( or PtdIns ) cleavage might be a second messenger for GPI - PLC control of endocytosis ( Figure 2 ) . DAG is a product of GPI - PLC cleavage of GPIs [ 39 , 40 ] , and so we considered the lipid as a possible second messenger produced by GPI - PLC . PMA , a phorbol ester , mimics the biological actions of DAG and is frequently used in place of DAG for physiological studies . We therefore tested whether exogenous PMA or DAG could stimulate endocytosis of transferrin in T . brucei RUMP528 ( GPI - PLC − / − ) . PMA enhanced transferrin uptake up to 4 - fold in T . brucei RUMP528 ( Figure 6A ) , in comparison with control cells that were treated with DMSO , the solvent for PMA . In a time - course study of T . brucei response to PMA , a 30 min exposure caused a maximal 4 - fold increase in endocytosis ( Figure 6B ) . However , PMA treatment of T . brucei for 45 min ( or more ) inhibited endocytosis ( Figure 6B ) . Dampening of endocytosis after extended PMA exposure , as has been reported in vertebrate cells [ 41 , 42 ] , may be caused by desensitization of DAG receptors . In a control experiment , the α - isomer of PMA ( i . e . 4 α - PMA ) failed to stimulate endocytosis ( results not shown ) . This last result indicates that , in T . brucei , the effects of PMA are limited to the physiologically active 4 β - PMA isomer , as reported in other biological systems [ 43 ] . We also tested whether PMA could c (cid:3) The Authors Journal compilation c (cid:3) 2009 Biochemical Society Glycosylphosphatidylinositol - speciﬁc phospholipase C 691 Figure 5 Enzyme activity of GPI - PLC is required to stimulate endocytosis ( A ) Endocytosis can be activated inT . bruceiby induction of GPI - PLC expression .

The phorbol ester promoted endocytosis in T . brucei 427 ( GPI - PLC + / + ) to levels similar to that observed in T . brucei RUMP528 ( Figure 6B ) . Furthermore , prolonged exposure of parasites to PMA reduced the uptake of transferrin ( Figure 6B ) , as noted for cells deﬁcient for GPI - PLC activity ( GPI - PLC − / − ) . DAG , the natural lipid whose actions are mimicked by PMA , is present in T . brucei . It was therefore important to test whether DAG also stimulated endocytosis . Towards this goal , the effects of OAG ( 1 - oleyl - 2 - acetyl - sn - glycerol ) and DMG ( dimyristoyl - sn - glycerol ) on transferrin endocytosis were studied . OAG is membrane - permeable DAG used for studies on vertebrate cells [ 44 ] . DMG is a component of GPIs in bloodstream T . brucei [ 45 ] , and it can be produced by GPI - PLC cleavage of GPIs [ 39 , 46 ] . OAG ( 500 nM ) stimulated transferrin uptake 4 - fold ( Fig - ure 6C ) , compared with cells that did not receive the lipid . Simi - larly , pre - treatment of T . brucei with DMG ( 500 nM ) led to 3 - fold higher transferrin accumulation , compared with cells exposed to the solvent ( DMSO ) alone ( Figure 6D ) . These data conﬁrm that a DAG signalling pathway exists in T . brucei . Furthermore , these observations prove that GPI - PLC itself is not needed for the activation of transferrin endocytosis , because either OAG or DMG facilitate endocytosis in cells that lack GPI - PLC genes . We surmise that , in wild - type T . brucei , DAG is a second messenger for the biological effects of GPI - PLC . DISCUSSION Regulation of transferrin endocytosis : a novel function for GPI - PLC in T . brucei The biological function of GPI - PLC in non - differentiating bloodstream - form T . brucei has been elusive . The gene for GPI - PLC is not essential for viability of T . brucei [ 16 , 18 ] . However , replication of the parasite in a vertebrate host is compromised in a GPIPLC − / − pleomorphic strain [ 16 ] . The molecular basis for the importance of GPI - PLC in the virulence of T . brucei is not resolved . Endocytosis is essential in T . brucei [ 8 , 9 ] , probably because some nutrients , e . g . iron and lipoproteins , are obtained by that route [ 47 , 48 ] . Furthermore , endocytosis is important for parasite evasion of host defence , in clearing anti - VSG antibody from the plasma membrane [ 7 ] . Parasite - absorbed anti - VSG antibody enables host Kupffer cells to phagocytose and kill T . brucei [ 49 , 50 ] . From this perspective , enhancement of endocytosis in bloodstream - form T . brucei may stimulate the virulence of the parasite . GPI - PLC stimulation of endocytosis ( Figures 2 , 3 and 5 ) will lead to more efﬁcient transferrin uptake ( i . e . better nutrition ; trans - ferrin is a growth factor for T . brucei [ 4 ] ) and more effective evasion of ( host ) innate defence pathways ( see the previous para - graph ) . These effects of the enzyme will promote the viability of the parasite in an infected vertebrate , and account , at least in c (cid:3) The Authors Journal compilation c (cid:3) 2009 Biochemical Society 692 S .

DAG as a second messenger in T . brucei Our data indicate that DAG is a second messenger in T . brucei . Exogenous DAGs , as well as PMA , a phorbol ester that mimics the biological activities of DAGs , increased transferrin endocytosis ( Figures 5 and 6 ) . These data establish DAG as a regulator of the endocytic system , and provide evidence for a DAG signalling pathway in T . brucei . How might DAG inﬂuence the endocytic machinery in T . brucei ? In eukaryotes , the effects of DAG on cell physiology de - pend on proteins with C1 - domains that bind to the lipid [ 51 ] . Cur - iously , the classic C1 - domain is not present in T . brucei , despite the cellular response of the parasite to the lipid ( Figures 2A , 5 and 6 ) . To resolve this perplexing situation , we hypothesized that the parasite may have a C1 - related domain that is highly diverged from the mammalian version , because trypanosomatids are ‘deeply diverged’ eukaryotes . To evaluate our theory , we performed , in collaboration with Ga¨elle Blandin ( Institute for Genomic Research , Rockville , MD , U . S . A . ) , a genome - wide bioinformatic search for C1 - related domains in T . brucei . That effort produced 21 hits ( results not shown ) . Further analysis of the protein sequences using SMART ( http : / / smart . embl - heidelberg . de / ) and PRATT ( http : / / www . ebi . ac . uk / pratt / ) revealed that each of the T . brucei C1 - related domains ( which we term C1 _ 5 ) contained the motif L - x ( 11 ) - C - x ( 2 , 4 ) - C - x ( 3 , 9 ) - E - x ( 2 , 9 ) - F - x - C - x ( 2 ) - C - x ( 4 ) - C - x ( 2 ) - C ( PROSITE nomenclature [ 52 ] ) . We hypothesize that C1 _ 5 is a receptor of DAG in T . brucei . [ C1 _ 5 is also found in Leishmania sp . and in Trypanosoma cruzi ( results not shown ) . ] How might proteins with C1 _ 5 domains activate the endocytic machinery after they bind to DAG ? We hypothesize that a C1 _ 5 protein might have a second domain that acts as the ‘effector’ for endocytosis . Consistent with our hypothesis , three C1 _ 5 proteins have other domains with enzyme activity , namely a protein tyrosine kinase ( accession number Tb11 . 01 . 2290 ) and ubiquitin ligases ( accession numbers Tb09 . 211 . 4210 and Tb927 . 8 . 1950 ) ( http : / / www . genedb . org / genedb / tryp / ) . In vertebrates , tyrosine phosphorylation of some receptors modulates endocytosis [ 53 ] . Ubiquitination of membrane proteins in yeasts and vertebrates accelerates their recruitment into endosomes [ 54 , 55 ] . Therefore we predict that DAG regulates transferrin endocytosis by activ - ating a protein tyrosine kinase and / or ubiquitin ligases that can post - translationallyactivatecomponents ( e . g . clathrinoradaptins ) of the endocytic pathway . It is unlikely that DAG activates a protein kinase C in the parasite because the genome of T . brucei does not encode a serine / threonine kinase with a C1 or C1 _ 5 domain , implying that T . brucei lacks a classic protein kinase C .
