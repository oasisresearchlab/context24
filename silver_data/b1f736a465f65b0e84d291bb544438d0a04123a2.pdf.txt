This paper uses design fction to consider what this tendency overlooks by examining settings where participants may exist in multiple power relationships simultaneously implicated by the re - search , specifcally focusing on the contexts of misinformation , disinformation , and online hate ( M / D / OH ) . Drawing from existing literature in M / D / OH , we present a series of imaginary method abstracts that prompt questions for researchers to refect on as they adapt PD techniques for new , diferent contexts . We highlight three value tensions—authenticity , reciprocity , and impact—integral to sustaining a concern for responsibility in PD scholarship . We end with refections and potential considerations for responsibly applying PD and design fction methods in M / D / OH settings .

Design scholarship has also begun to probe the limits of participa - tory design ( PD ) for centering equity [ 57 ] , pointing to important gaps when researchers wield power over participating groups and ultimately control whose voices matter . Trying to engage Chicago residents in a conversation about smart city development , for ex - ample , Christina Harrington , Sheena Erete , and Anne Marie Piper [ 57 ] have discussed how PD workshops are often structured to further marginalize underserved and overburdened groups , such as through the use of particular ideational materials ( colored pen - cils , markers ) that can feel infantilizing . Across this body of work , scholars tend to apply PD in settings where researchers hold more power than participating groups . Separately , a long tradition of ethnographic research has exam - ined a wide set of power relationships , including what some call “studying up” — or the process by which researchers closely ex - amine powerful actors , institutions , and structures as their locus of inquiry [ 86 , 91 , 112 ] . From high - tech technology frms to hate groups 1 , scholars have outlined the varied threats to researcher safety and well - being , as well as difculties related to the possi - bility of elevating the very voices researchers aim to challenge or hold to account [ 5 , 86 , 91 , 112 ] . Though some design scholars have found methods of participant observation productive , techniques of PD remain an important but under - studied tool in settings where participants hold signifcant power , especially in revealing whose perspectives matter and how . What would it mean to apply PD techniques to interactive sys - tem design within a wider set of relationships to power ? Drawing from these distinct conversations , this paper turns to the multi - faceted complexities of misinformation , disinformation , and online hate ( M / D / OH ) as a problem space to examine the tradeofs of PD . This area of research is especially notable given the important soci - etal ramifcations of misinformation and disinformation for public health [ 87 ] , democratic processes [ 28 ] , and climate change [ 117 ] ( among many other areas ) , and the widespread prevalence of online hate [ 7 , 66 ] . Design scholarship has an important role to play in addressing these issues , as the structure of online platforms and systems signifcantly impacts the prevalence of these phenomena , and there is growing awareness of the value of community - engaged design methods in these contexts . In a recent ( 2022 ) roadmap for “information integrity research” [ 64 ] , the U . S . National Science and 1 " Studying up " as applied to hate groups could be contested . Scholars have traced how such groups claim to have been marginalized for some time , even as they ascend in their cultural currency and connections to infrastructures of power ( e . g . [ 100 ] ) . 1724 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Joseph Schafer et al . Technology Council recommended using participatory methods to both understand how communities are impacted by “corrupted in - formation” and to design interventions to help communities protect themselves against these harms . However , M / D / OH researchers are just beginning to explore the use of participatory research methodologies in these contexts . As PD methods grow in popu - larity and reach [ 43 , 99 , 111 ] , as scholars increasingly attach an implicit positivity to community - engaged work [ 111 ] , and as par - ticipatory design is applied to an increasingly broad set of contexts [ 16 ] , we hold a greater responsibility to interrogate and question our assumptions as design scholars . To understand the potential impacts of PD in these settings , we turn to design fction , a method of envisioning what particular contexts might be like in the future through speculative scenarios and stories . Here , we employ and adapt imaginary method abstracts to anticipate methodological and ethical challenges in pursuing this work . Imaginary method abstracts ( based on work by Mark Blythe and Elizabeth Buie [ 21 , 22 ] ) is an adapted approach to assess the consequences of potential design research by writing in the style of academic abstracts about fctional prototypes and their future study . We combine this technique with insights from a stakeholder analysis to sketch possible futures for PD in M / D / OH research and foreground value tensions in using these methods in the M / D / OH context [ 47 ] . This paper explores some of the benefts and risks of applying PD methodologies to this context , and lays out potential paths for combining these areas of research . This work makes three main contributions to scholarship on in - teractive systems design . First , it expands conversations on power by examining what participatory techniques might open and fore - close in contested settings such as M / D / OH . In particular , we out - line three salient value tensions for sustained responsibility in PD engagement—authenticity , reciprocity , and impact—and urge in - teractive system design scholars to consider the varied axes along which participatory approaches might be adapted as they move and scale . In this way , we see this paper as adding to conversations around conducting efective , responsible PD research , similar to the guidelines for participatory equity - centered design outlined by non - profts such as The Creative Reaction Lab [ 33 ] . Second , we illustrate how adapted imaginary abstracts that fo - cus on fctional methodological developments ( rather than fctional prototypes ) help scholars consider the tradeofs of design research approaches . The expanded technique helps scholars of interactive systems design imagine possible outcomes of a future method ap - plication . This work complements existing examples of imaginary abstracts to consider a wider set of potential interventions premised on participation . Lastly , our analysis helps bolster the imaginative dimensions of empirical inquiry and analysis ( trace ethnography , social media analysis , etc . ) connected with M / D / OH research . By examining some of the potential benefts and risks of using participatory ap - proaches , and by outlining tensions between the goals of liberal democracy and justice - oriented scholarship , we help scholars imag - ine what participatory techniques might involve within M / D / OH contexts and how M / D / OH scholars might navigate their use , ne - gotiation , and adaptation . 2 BACKGROUND Our work builds on existing research across two areas of study : ( 1 ) the goals and outcomes of PD and ( 2 ) the role of PD in M / D / OH contexts . We review core ideas within both conversations in the sections that follow . 2 . 1 Participatory Design Many disciplines have a history of using participatory approaches to research . Within the feld of human - computer interaction , com - mon early examples of PD arise from the tradition of Scandinavian design , through projects like the UTOPIA project [ 42 ] and the early work of the Norwegian Iron and Metal Workers’ Union [ 52 ] . With additional attention to equity , PD research allows research par - ticipants to have a more authentic voice in the research process , beyond what they might have in other design workshop formats or through other qualitative methodologies , like interviews or surveys . As Harrington and colleagues ( p . 20 [ 57 ] ) note , “ [ e ] quitable PD con - siders and centers those who have been historically underserved , communities that have not been in positions of power . ” Alongside recognizing power diferentials , this process can help cede some of the researchers’ and / or designers’ power to the participants [ 56 ] . This approach also aligns with the slogan popularized by the disability rights movement , “nothing about us without us , ” which Sasha Costanza - Chock has connected to PD and other methods of community - involved research and design [ 31 ] . When conducted with care , PD can embody community - centered , democratic values which allow those traditionally excluded to have meaningful input into designing systems . However , saying that PD has the potential to involve commu - nities and historically excluded populations does not mean that it inherently represents and incorporates these perspectives au - thentically . Even deciding what community means , how it gets defned , and by whom shapes the problems designers defne and address . Recognizing the complexity of this participatory turn , our work builds on decades of critical anthropological scholarship [ 4 , 59 , 63 , 110 ] and decolonial thought [ 121 , 122 , 129 ] focusing on the particularities of research participation within uneven power relationships . Lilly Irani , for example , critiques PD research as seek - ing to surface evidence of predetermined conclusions of funders or researchers , rather than actually representing the authentic perspec - tives of participants [ 37 ] . Similarly , Noura Howell and colleagues refect on their own work and how it has failed in the past by primar - ily representing the creations of designers , even in the context of a co - designing , participatory framework [ 61 ] , and Suzanne Bødker and Morten Kyng refect on how participatory design scholars often choose to engage participants in ways that allow them to avoid political stances [ 23 ] . More broadly , PD brings up as a question whether design is the most efective or important way to work with communities , especially those already harmed by societal systems . Even Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby , critiqued for their univer - salizing gaze on what futures are preferable [ 89 , 115 ] , recognize its participatory limits . They write : “the power of design is often overestimated . Sometimes we can have more efect as citizens than as designers . Protests and boycotts can still be the most efective ways of making a point” ( p . 37 of [ 38 ] ) . This range of scholarship observes how PD processes often give researchers more power to 1725 PD and Power in M / D / OH Research DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA frame the terms of study and greater latitude to focus on their own perspectives in communicating the results of the work . As Randi Markussen ( p . 63 of [ 78 ] ) reminds , these researchers are “neither innocent nor all powerful , ” but hold their own invested interests . Despite these shortcomings , recall from Harrington and col - leagues above , PD has the potential to efectively challenge harm - ful managerial structures and forge new relationships to decision - making . This is especially true if , as Sarah Fox et . al . argue , PD re - searchers are refexive throughout the research process and actively evaluate the power dynamics present within a research scenario [ 44 ] . It is this tension between the benefts of community - driven processes and the risks of over - representation that we seek to probe within settings of M / D / OH research . 2 . 2 Existing PD work in M / D / OH - related contexts Misinformation , disinformation , and online hate are three impor - tant subcategories of harmful content online . We adapt our def - nitions for misinformation and disinformation from the work of Caroline Jack , defning misinformation as false — but not necessar - ily intentionally false — information , and disinformation as false or misleading information deliberately spread with the intention to de - ceive [ 65 ] . Though defnitions of hate speech ( and therefore online hate ) are contested [ 6 ] , we defne online hate here as online con - tent which targets an individual or group with hostile and harmful content ( including racist , misogynistic , anti - Semitic , Islamophobic , transphobic , or homophobic content , among others ) , often based on identities the targeted person holds . We group these three ar - eas — misinformation , disinformation , and online hate ( M / D / OH ) — together as they are often deeply entangled , co - occurring phenom - ena , and thinking of them collectively allows us to consider more of the nuances that diferent aspects of harmful content research bring to PD studies in these areas . Examples of this entanglement include anti - Semitic conspiracy theories based on centuries - old hate - based disinformation [ 46 ] , and disinformation campaigns that opportunistically amplify false rumors ( what would otherwise be misinformation ) [ 108 ] . Recently , scholars have criticized the felds of misinformation and disinformation research for having too narrow of a focus on certain kinds of mis - and disinformation . These include J . Khadijah Abdurahman and Andre Brock , Jr . ’s critiques that M / D / OH research centers predominantly white communities [ 1 ] , Sarah Nguyeˆ˜n et . al . ’s writings that M / D / OH research has been predominantly U . S . and Anglo - centric [ 85 ] , and Alice Marwick et . al . ’s critical disin - formation syllabus which shows how the feld has tended to ne - glect examples beyond social media [ 80 ] . Though there has been some work on M / D / OH in other national contexts , including Brazil [ 19 , 73 , 101 ] , Indonesia and the Philippines [ 90 ] , India [ 3 , 13 ] , and Nigeria [ 8 ] , and others have recently outlined how disinformation research can move beyond these more narrow conceptualizations [ 40 , 74 , 93 , 120 ] , as a whole the felds of M / D / OH research have tended to focus on white , English - speaking , Global North - based contexts . It is worth noting that the reason for this focus is not because other communities do not face challenges , which is clear from responses by minoritized communities to these problems ( for examples , see [ 53 , 62 ] ) . This overrepresentation is likely at least partially attributable to the fact that these research communities , and academia as a whole , are white - dominated spaces where Black and Brown voices disproportionately face elision and silencing [ 88 ] . The reproduction of this inequitable recognition within M / D / OH scholarship could be for two related , but distinct , reasons . First , as J . Khadijah Abdurahman and Andre Brock , Jr . note [ 1 ] , white misinformation and disinformation researchers could be focused on the issues that they see as most prevalent or impactful to their communities , such as the QAnon conspiracy movement , and focus their research on those topics with which they have the most expe - rience . Slightly diferently , white researchers may be disinclined to study communities of color as outsiders , perhaps because they do not have the cultural or linguistic knowledge necessary to conduct research in these communities , or due to concern that studying them through this ‘outside’ framing could serve to problematize or stigmatize already marginalized groups . Partially as a response to these critiques of the narrow scope of the feld , and alongside calls from US federal agencies like the White House Ofce of Science and Technology Policy to more broadly involve community - engaged methods in M / D / OH - related research [ 64 ] , researchers have begun to use community - engaged , partici - patory , and interactive system design - based methods in M / D / OH contexts . Jason Young and colleagues wrote about the need for work with librarians to combat misinformation resulting from a series of community - engaged workshops , calling for the design of efec - tive anti - misinformation resources for librarians and for support in addressing the social and political contexts limiting librarians’ abilities to address these issues [ 128 ] . Zahra Ashktorab and Jessica Vitak used PD methods to research teen cyberbullying , which falls under a broad defnition of online hate , and shows how PD can be used to help victims to address online harms by describing several system prototypes to mitigate harm [ 12 ] . Ahmer Arif proposes us - ing design - based research methods to research both how people react emotionally to the information they are consuming and to develop strategies to be more thoughtful about the information they are consuming [ 9 ] . Tamar Wilner et . al . organized a series of work - shops to co - design methods for increasing digital literacy in BIPOC and rural communities [ 124 ] . Sukrit Venkatagiri and colleagues designed an interactive system to support crowdsourced misinfor - mation investigations [ 123 ] . Participatory game design ( PGD ) is also a method which has already gained traction in these research contexts , such as Carlos Roberto Torres - Parra et . al . ’s Poder Violeta project , a participatorily designed video game used to combat sex - ual harassment ( though focused more on ofine rather than online hate ) [ 116 ] , the work of Ioana Literat et . al . on using PGD to create games to combat the spread of fake news [ 76 ] , and the “Loki’s Loop” project led by Chris Coward , Jin Ha Lee , and Lindsay Morse to build escape rooms to raise awareness of misinformation [ 32 ] . Within a related area of online conficts , Kavous Salehzadeh Niksirat et . al . used participatory design methods to create an interactive system for resolving privacy conficts [ 105 ] . Collectively , these studies have demonstrated the viability of using these research methodologies for topics broadly in M / D / OH contexts . We look across these stud - ies to consider the breadth of M / D / OH research and its impacts to probe how PD could be used in M / D / OH research , and the value tensions this approach would surface . Considering a wide array of 1726 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Joseph Schafer et al . these potential paths forward for PD research would help provide a roadmap for careful scholarship in these areas . 3 METHODS Our analysis builds on a deep and long - term engagement in research on misinformation , disinformation , and online hate by Joseph S . Schafer ( three years ) and Kate Starbird ( ten years ) . During the course of this research , both authors have relied primarily on mixed - methods social media data analysis , qualitative interviews and text analysis , and considered the limits of these methods for understand - ing the contextual realities of navigating M / D / OH spaces , as well as for envisioning alternative system designs to address these issues . Below we describe our attempt to better understand the potential of PD developments in M / D / OH contexts , a path that took us from stakeholder analysis to imaginary abstracts and value tensions . 3 . 1 Stakeholder Analysis First , the authors performed a modifed version of the stakeholder analysis process described in the work of Batya Friedman and col - leagues [ 47 ] . Drawing from their extensive experience in these contexts , the authors developed a table of various kinds of com - munities which are impacted by M / D / OH phenomena , and have been studied by researchers working in these felds . The authors also developed a list of the possible designable artifacts that are relevant to M / D / OH , again informed by our observations from our experience working in these contexts . As the specifc context of a particular artifact and community are highly relevant to whether a community is a direct or indirect stakeholder as defned by [ 47 ] , we do not diferentiate between these kinds of stakeholders in our tables . We also do not intend these stakeholder lists to be system - atic , only to represent a list of several communities and artifacts potentially relevant for PD work in M / D / OH contexts . 3 . 2 Imaginary Method Abstracts Design fctions broadly have a rich tradition of surfacing ethical issues and other considerations with technologies and designed artifacts [ 26 , 69 ] . As a form of design fction , imaginary abstracts are a technique developed by Mark Blythe and Elizabeth Buie based on science fction author Stanislav Lem’s prefaces and introduc - tions written as if in the future , which allows , in their words , “the author to play with ideas , plots and character without having to write an entire novel or short story” [ 21 , 22 ] . For Blythe and Buie , the imaginary abstracts focus on prototypes — designs that might or might not exist and research settings have not happened [ 21 , 22 ] . They describe the fctional registers as multiple — designs , felds of study , and fndings . Across these fctional dimensions , the au - thors suggest that this writing technique prompts useful questions such as whether failure is a useful fnding and whether a deploy - ment is “worth doing ? ” Here , we adapt this method to focus on PD research studies , rather than prototypes—opening an array of questions around the stakes of methodological adaptation and ex - pansion . Attending to the adversarial nature of the D / OH contexts , we specifcally chose to add watermarks to each of these imaginary method abstracts , to prevent them from being recontextualized in deceptive ways — for example to falsely claim that these studies have been recommended or already conducted by these authors or other researchers in the feld . 3 . 3 Value Tensions Analysis After developing our imaginary method abstracts , we thought about the benefts and risks of using PD methods for M / D / OH research , combining all of these together across abstracts through successive rounds of close - reading and conversation between the authors . These discussions included iteration and elaboration on the tables and abstracts , such as refning the vocabulary used in row 3 of the table to describe those afected by M / D / OH as manipulated targets and denigrated targets 2 , rather than as target vectors and target victims , and adding Abstract 4 after noticing additional tensions that our prior abstracts did not sufciently illustrate . We then regrouped these implications based on similarities in the underlying values that these benefts and risks implicated . As each of these groups included both benefts and risks , these are best understood as value tensions , and specifcally tensions within values . Value tensions are also an important part of the process developed by Batya Friedman and colleagues [ 47 ] , though their work focuses more on tensions between values . Focusing on tensions within values allows us to specifcally think about when these values are useful in service of the broader goals of the research we pursue , or if they can actually frustrate or harm those goals , rather than implicitly assuming these values we seek to embody in our research are always positive . Combining elements of value - sensitive design analysis with spec - ulative approaches has proven fruitful for past research , such as in the work of Stephanie Ballard et . al . engaging designers with these methods to surface ethical concerns for hypothetical technologies [ 15 ] . Our related method of combining the stakeholder analysis component of VSD analysis with the use of imaginary abstracts to elicit value tensions has multiple advantages . First , the stake - holder analysis allows us to consider a wide array of the potential approaches PD research could take in studying M / D / OH topics , emphasizing breadth . Second , the creation of imaginary method abstracts allows us to focus on a small number of possibilities , and think through the particular implications of doing those kinds of work . By concretizing the hypothetical research directions and help - ing clarify our methodological critique , the approach also allows us to more quickly consider an array of the methodological value tensions arising from a PD research approach , as the imaginary method abstracts allow us to envision studies in sufcient detail but do not require us to conduct the full project . While imaginary method abstracts can be a powerful design fction tool , there are a few limits to the insights this approach can generate , and to the value tensions they can then illuminate . First , the level of detail within these imaginary method abstracts is necessarily low ; knowing more about specifc methodological intricacies would potentially allow for a more nuanced exploration of the value tensions raised by the study . Furthermore , both the abstracts and the illuminated value tensions are also limited by the positionality of the authors , and so other value tensions that are relevant to this research may not have been perceived by our team . 2 Target is a common rhetorical framing within M / D / OH research conversations , though this kind of language evokes more militaristic imagery than is common in the care - oriented feld of PD research . We refect on these language tensions in our discussion section . 1727 PD and Power in M / D / OH Research DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Table 1 : A table outlining some potential participant communities for hypothetical PD studies in the context of online misinformation , disinformation , and hateful content .

First , informed by a partial stakeholder analysis and drawing on the authors’ prior experiences in studying M / D / OH topics , we develop two tables below . The frst table suggests a list of possible communities to engage in PD research on this topic , and the second suggests the kinds of artifacts which could be ( re ) designed as part of the research process . The communities we highlight are informed by both the authors’ experiences working in these areas , as well as by existing literature focusing on these communities in non - PD frameworks , and we highlight relevant work on examples of these community types for each row of this table . Though many of these community stakeholder groups are rel - atively straightforward to understand , it is worth explaining that row 3 , targeted communities , can mean multiple kinds of recipi - ents of M / D / OH content . First , there are communities which are manipulated targets , or communities which are utilized by disin - formation purveyors to spread disinformation or hateful content to a wider audience . There are also denigrated target communities , or communities which are being bombarded with online hate and disinformation vilifying or scapegoating them . For our next table , we outline possible artifacts that could be the focus of a PD study on M / D / OH . The artifacts we highlight represent categories that often fgure prominently in academic and popular discourse around these topics . Just as several communities are involved in various aspects of misinformation , disinformation , and online hate , so are many kinds of artifacts , meaning that PD research on M / D / OH topics could consider designing a variety of objects . As we can see from the above tables , there are a variety of set - tings where PD could be applied to research into misinformation , disinformation , and online hate . We do not claim this list to be comprehensive ; rather , we ofer the tables as generative artifacts laying out several possible avenues for future research . To ground our discussion of PD research in these contexts , we next present our imaginary method abstracts [ 21 , 22 ] which could potentially be conducted to study aspects of misinformation , disinformation , and online hate , loosely inspired by the above tables . Our abstracts are similarly grounded in prior contexts of literature and real - world events , as they draw from both combinations of the rows in our two 1728 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Joseph Schafer et al . Table 2 : A table outlining some potential artifacts for hypothetical PD studies in the context of online misinformation , disinformation , and hateful content , alongside examples of what current examples of these artifacts might look like . This is not intended to be comprehensive . These rows are also not mutually exclusive , and artifacts can represent a combination of diferent rows . Design artifacts Examples of existing artifacts in these categories A . Platform moderation infrastructure These are mostly internal to platforms , one prominent example in the news was Facebook’s XCheck program [ 60 ] B . Ofcial platform policies Facebook’s community standards [ 82 ] ; Twitter’s former Covid misinformation policy [ 71 ] C . Informational campaigns / PSAs CDC messaging campaigns around the coronavirus vaccines [ 84 ] D . Platform afordances The quote - tweet feature as a platform - supported mode of interaction , which exists on Twitter but not on Mastodon ; the ability to comment on YouTube videos E . Community norms / guidelines The code of conduct enforced on the 2022 CSCW Discord server , available at [ 2 ] F . Support systems for harmful content targets Resource guides for targets of online harassment [ 48 ] ; anti - harassment Twitter plug - ins [ 20 ] G .

Legal policies around M / D / OH France’s former anti - misinformation and hate speech law [ 25 ] ; German laws requiring removal of pro - Nazi and Holocaust - denying social media content [ 41 ] Figure 1 : Our frst imaginary method abstract , overlaid with a watermark to prevent recontextualization . tables and from important M / D / OH research which used method - ologies other than participatory design . The frst abstract helps us ask : how might PD be used to directly engage with and support groups integral to counteracting M / D / OH , but that have been primarily studied in other contexts ? Abstract 1 is informed by the work of Sarah Roberts [ 103 ] , and is a combination of Row 2 ( content moderation workers ) from Table 1 , and Row A ( platform moderation infrastructure ) from Table 2 . Sarah Roberts’ work [ 103 ] showed the horrible working conditions and lack of support that content moderation workers are often given at major social media platforms . Designing alternative support systems could be a productive use of PD methods . However , what would it look like to do PD work with a popu - lation that are the direct denigrated targets of disinformation and online hate , and to design less technologically - oriented artifacts ? Abstract 2 is built of of a recognition of the increasing threats that election workers face [ 130 ] , and is a combination of Row 3b ( denigrated targets ) from Table 1 , and Rows B ( platform policies ) and H ( legal policies ) from Table 2 . Here , we wanted to imagine the vulnerabilities denigrated target groups face , and the risks of focusing a research spotlight on these communities . We also wanted to specifcally think about what the implications of having policy as a participatory design artifact would be in the M / D / OH context . Thus far our imaginary method abstracts have focused on those harmed or victimized by M / D / OH . The next abstract helps us ask : 1729 PD and Power in M / D / OH Research DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Figure 2 : Our second imaginary method abstract , overlaid with a watermark to prevent recontextualization . Figure 3 : Our third imaginary method abstract , overlaid with a watermark to prevent recontextualization . What happens if we instead consider applying PD methods to study - ing groups that are causing the spread of M / D / OH ? Abstract 3 is informed by prior work by Joan Donovan , Becca Lewis , and Brian Friedberg on digital infrastructures used by white nationalist and far - right groups , such as [ 36 ] , and is a combination of Rows 3a ( manipulated target communities ) and 5 ( creators of harmful online campaigns ) from Table 1 , and Row A ( platform moderation infrastructure ) and Row D ( platform afordances ) from Table 2 . We use this abstract to think through the challenges of doing PD work with participants that have goals in opposition to the researchers , as well as the methodological and ethical issues with doing PD work involving deception in the research process — issues that grow especially complicated in the M / D / OH context . Finally , we use our last abstract to examine PD within a commu - nity that is both a target of M / D / OH as well as highly marginalized in other contexts . In particular , we ask : How can researchers use PD to understand these situations in a more nuanced way ? Abstract 4 builds of recent work by Sarah Nguyeˆ˜n et . al . study - ing disinformation in Asian diasporic communities [ 85 ] , and is a combination of Row 3a ( manipulated targets ) from Table 1 , and Row C ( informational campaigns ) from Table 2 . Here , we wanted to think through studying a possible vector target community , and what doing PD work in that context would mean . We also wanted to understand through this fctional study how to conduct PD work in M / D / OH without problematizing the community with which we are collaborating . 1730 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Joseph Schafer et al .

In particular , we describe how value tensions pertaining to authentic - ity , reciprocity , and impact are especially salient when evaluating the implications of using this research method . Below , we elaborate on each of these value tensions revealed by imagining PD research in these contexts . 5 . 1 Authenticity The frst value tension that became salient in thinking through these fctional studies relates to authenticity . By this , we mean genuine representation of the scope , contexts , and experiences of a topic . In the M / D / OH context , this means authentically representing the concerns , needs , and issues facing communities involved in or impacted by M / D / OH , rather than solely relying on researcher - or designer - imposed frames . This increased authentic visibility could have signifcant upsides , such as increased attention to community concerns or access to resources , but authentic visibility might also increase the potential for harm . One way that authenticity can be promoted by PD in M / D / OH contexts comes from the potential to signifcantly improve the repre - sentation of groups currently excluded from mainstream M / D / OH research conversations . PD methods could allow researchers to cede their power and perspective to participants , to more authen - tically represent the diversity of perspectives on M / D / OH topics . For example , even if the researchers have not themselves been con - tractors working in content moderation , using PD for a study of content moderation contractors like that described in Abstract 1 could be useful to gain an authentic understanding of the issues these communities face . Alongside eforts to make structures within the academy more equitable , the study of these communities and their struggles with online misinformation and disinformation is important . Using PD to study these aspects of M / D / OH may help to address omissions in our understanding of these phenomena , both regarding our knowledge of the issues and our abilities to con - front M / D / OH . PD frameworks could be a way to conduct research so as to more authentically understand the perspectives of these communities . Though engaging authentically with the communities and con - texts is necessary for doing PD research in M / D / OH , this process can be traumatic for researchers . Even in less directly - engaged methods , researchers working in M / D / OH contexts come across graphic , upsetting or disorienting content , much like the commu - nities that the researchers are studying . For example , Ahmer Arif et . al . write that when studying disinformation about Russian in - formation operatives on Twitter engaging in discussions about the Black Lives Matter movement , “we found ourselves experiencing doubt when linking some of these accounts with pejorative terms like ‘trolling’ and ‘propaganda’ . This was especially true when we immersed ourselves with RU - IRA data in the ways that most closely resemble how an ordinary social media user would encounter their content , ” indicating that this research can be emotionally challeng - ing and disorienting , especially when engaging in a way closer or more similar to that of participants [ 10 ] . Additionally , writing about a more directly engaged — though not based in PD — research study , Francesca Tripodi writes that “Once I began watching , read - ing , and listening to the news that my conservative respondents cited as trustworthy , it became increasingly difcult to discern the truth . . . I started applying [ conspiratorial frames popular in these communities ] to my own understanding of current events without even realizing it” ( p . xv of [ 118 ] ) . Trauma for researchers from engaging with stressful research content is something that has been grappled with in felds outside of M / D / OH as well , such as in domestic violence research [ 45 ] . However , the more hands - on nature of PD methods means that the level of engagement with po - tentially traumatizing and / or disorienting content and topics could be exacerbated . The level to which these traumas are experienced are also dependent on the researcher’s positionality . For example , 1731 PD and Power in M / D / OH Research DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA though doing research that engages directly with neo - Nazi or white nationalist communities , such as described in Abstract 3 , would be traumatic for many researchers , this might be particularly harmful for researchers of color or others targeted by hate . Furthermore , as several of our abstracts make clear , authentically representing other perspectives through conducting PD research within M / D / OH contexts might cause harm to those communi - ties . Harms related to visibility , both from academic research ( e . g . [ 83 , 97 , 104 ] ) and in online settings ( e . g . [ 35 , 96 ] ) have been seriously explored in previous research . The imaginary abstracts we produced also show ways that these visibility risks could manifest for PD research in M / D / OH contexts . By spotlighting a group targeted by misinformation , disinformation , or online hate campaigns , like the research on election ofcials receiving death threats for alleged malfeasance described in Abstract 2 , this increased attention could put a larger target on these groups , and subject them to further harassment or attacks . Further , increased visibility in the context of M / D / OH research may be perceived as problematizing the studied community — i . e . increasing perceptions that the community is vul - nerable to spreading misinformation and / or disinformation — and could lead to stigmatization . This is especially true for studies with manipulated target communities . For example , increasing attention on the Asian - American diasporic community , as the imaginary study in Abstract 4 would do , could lead to a misperception that they are more vulnerable than other communities , causing harm to the community and possibly resulting in additional distrust of researchers and scientifc research more broadly ( exacerbating the very problems that the study seeks to help mitigate ) . Similarly , the increased visibility brought to the content moderation contractors through the study in Abstract 1 could cause their employer to fre these workers for being critical of their work conditions . 5 . 2 Reciprocity Another value tension which we found salient for considering PD research in M / D / OH contexts is that of reciprocity . For this context , we defne reciprocity ( in line with prior work [ 18 ] ) as ensuring participants and researchers have mutual respect , understanding , and concern for each other , rather than emphasizing independence or the ossifcation of roles and stratifcations . As Cynthia L . Ben - nett and Daniela K . Rosner describe , “ [ o ] rienting designers to ex - pect reciprocation might shift empathy building toward opportuni - ties for mutual sense making , multiple frst person narratives , and shared accountability” ( p . 9 of [ 18 ] ) . Reciprocity can help to pro - mote more empathetic respect and understanding , but with some groups involved in M / D / OH , especially with creators of harmful online campaigns , this empathetic respect or understanding may not be possible or desirable . PD research can embody a value of reciprocity with some com - munities in that the method can be used to develop and demonstrate respect and care . While we describe the previous risk of authentic - ity related to problematizing groups by increasing their visibility in M / D / OH contexts , embodying reciprocity and mutual understand - ing could mitigate this threat . For example , in the case of Abstract 4 , PD methodologies could help legitimize the real concerns of Asian - American diasporic communities where misinformation and disinformation are often prevalent , and push back against confa - tions of mis / disinformation and the community in which it spreads . However , reciprocity might not always be possible to establish for PD studies in M / D / OH contexts . Reciprocity requires mutual respect , both from the researcher toward the participant commu - nity as well as from the participants toward the researcher [ 18 ] . Doing research in these contexts is already risky for researchers , who face harassment , threats , and legal attacks on their work . PD is a method which far more directly engages with participants than many common M / D / OH approaches like large - scale social media analysis [ 68 ] , digital ethnography [ 125 ] , or qualitative analysis of online content [ 17 ] , which means that these sorts of risks are likely to be amplifed if engaging directly with those who are spread - ing M / D / OH . While less of a problem in establishing reciprocity with denigrated target communities , such as Abstract 2 , the risk dramatically increases when engaging with participants who are actively spreading harmful content , such as Abstract 3 . Engagement with hostile or targeting communities even in traditional research methodologies is already something contested in research ethics circles ( e . g . [ 49 , 67 , 81 ] ) , and that level of interaction with these communities is far less than is required for PD . The positionality of researchers is also important here , as researchers holding diferent racial , sexual , disability , or gender identities would be diferentially vulnerable to these attacks , for at least two reasons . First , many groups that believe in conspiracy theories or spread online hate do so toward specifc identities and directed toward specifc den - igrated target communities , such as anti - Semitic or anti - feminist conspiracy theories , so researchers belonging to these identities are likely to face even more vicious attacks or threats from the groups they are studying . Secondly , the identities that researchers hold may make them more vulnerable to attack , less likely to be believed when reporting that they are being attacked , and less likely to be taken seriously as rigorous scholars . Though the risks of direct con - tact exist for many researchers in studies of hostile communities like the neo - Nazi communities in Abstract 3 , these are heightened when the researcher holds identities directly targeted by the group they are studying . 5 . 3 Impact The third and fnal primary value tension we found salient in our fctional abstracts concerns the notion of impact , or doing research that has real - world ramifcations . PD is a methodology which pri - oritizes having real impacts for its participants , and for attempting to create real change . Similarly , recent calls for misinformation re - search to treat itself as a “crisis discipline” akin to climate research have circulated , underscoring that impact is also important for re - search in M / D / OH contexts [ 14 ] . Conducting impactful research can help to address the problems of M / D / OH , but may also have unjust results ( anticipated or unknown ) . One way that PD practices for M / D / OH research can be benef - cially impactful for community members is by using the research method to empower communities and help them become more resilient against misinformation and disinformation . Recent work has argued that many people turn to misinformation because they are feeling disempowered [ 127 ] and that community empowerment 1732 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Joseph Schafer et al . can reduce belief in false conspiracy theories [ 98 ] . PD , by facilitat - ing direct engagement with participants , could not only support empowerment but also support education and outreach eforts to counter M / D / OH . Researchers have already begun to explore how community - engaged work with libraries , for example , can help to counter misinformation [ 128 ] , and PD could continue to advance this work . This form of community engagement could help com - munity members grapple with the harms caused by participating in spreading hate and provide fact - checking / countering content to promote community resilience . Impactful PD research for studying M / D / OH could , on the other hand , present broader risks to the research community by platform - ing false or hateful ideas and allowing them to gain impact . This is already an issue acknowledged in the M / D / OH research context , under the framing of giving content the “oxygen of amplifcation” [ 95 ] . If we were to conduct PD research with communities that are actively causing harm through spreading M / D / OH , such as of the neo - Nazis studied in Abstract 3 , the ceding of power to communi - ties which occurs in PD may serve to amplify these views , giving them a greater reach than they might otherwise have . Even beyond direct amplifcation of these views , applying PD in this context could serve to further center these particular harmful communities , rather than the perspectives of those surviving the harms , perspec - tives that disinformation studies have largely neglected . This is not to say that the centering problems in M / D / OH research , as previously critiqued in [ 1 ] , would dramatically worsen with PD research , but rather that using this research methodology does not automatically address these centering problems . Instead , PD could elevate those problems if exclusively applied to the same sub - set of M / D / OH research topics . These concerns about amplifying and platforming harmful ideologies expand beyond the realm of academia for researchers working in this space . Currently , given the relevance of online misinformation , disinformation , and hateful content to major societal issues like the January 6 insurrection [ 106 ] , the coronavirus pandemic [ 24 ] , and climate change [ 70 ] , research in these spaces often migrates quickly into public conversations with policymakers , platform ofcials , and journalists . As a result , these problems of platforming and ceding power to groups actively caus - ing harm could ripple out beyond the realm of academic discussions of M / D / OH . The use of PD for impactful M / D / OH research also has the risk of generating backlash efects which could hinder future work in these contexts and researchers’ ability to address these harms . In all four of our abstracts , it is possible to imagine how they could be weaponized against the feld . In Abstract 1 , the act of participatory research with content moderation workers could be criticized as researcher interference into platforms , along the same lines as the public backlash to the misleading criticisms of the “Twitter Files” [ 75 ] . Similarly , researchers using their positions to advocate for policies to protect harassment victims of election disinformation as described in Abstract 2 could also be subject to claims that re - searcher support of government ( even local government such as election ofcials ) is synonymous with harmful “collusion” , a line of criticism which has previously been applied to research in M / D / OH [ 29 ] . Abstract 3’s use of a ‘counter - participatory’ design framework , which in essence relies on deceiving the white nationalist partic - ipants , is also very easily criticized , just as the “New Knowledge” research project was criticized for using deception during an active political race , problematically employing disinformation in an at - tempt to understand it [ 107 ] . In a study like Abstract 4 , researchers studying M / D / OH topics in manipulated target communities , espe - cially those which have historically been ill - treated by researchers , may fnd their work being reframed and used as evidence that re - searchers are not to be trusted by the very groups targeting these communities in the frst place . Depending on the specifcs of each of the studies described in our abstracts and the conduct of the research teams in these imaginary studies , these criticisms may be made in good or bad faith — and have varying levels of credibility . Given the already highly contested , politicized nature of M / D / OH research , it’s easy to imagine that work using PD methods could increase backlash to both individual research teams and to the feld as a whole , which researchers should consider when organizing and presenting on this research . Additionally , researchers working for public impact can also face increased mental strain and pressure , such as feelings that they are failing if the real - world impacts they want their work to have fail to materialize . This is something that researchers like Natascha Klocker have grappled with in related participatory methodologies , such as participatory action research , concluding that researchers should think carefully about what kind of participation is appro - priate for the impact their work will have , and that researchers should emotionally prepare for the challenges of attempting im - pactful research [ 72 ] . The implications of these research topics for major world events can mean that researchers feel pressure to have their research impact these issues . Further , in the PD context , researchers may feel even more pressure ( compared with other methodologies ) to ensure their participants are positively impacted by the research they are conducting . For example , depending on the depth of connection formed between researchers and partners , researchers may feel increased responsibility to improve the em - ployment conditions for the content moderation contractors in Abstract 1 or to protect election worker participants from future death threats in Abstract 2 . This possibility is particularly true for researchers who are themselves targets of online hate or are members of communities targeted by mis - and disinformation , as they are members of the communities they are hoping to impact . With amplifed stakes , they may feel obliged to perform impactful research for their participants and themselves . 6 DISCUSSION We have so far seen how speculative approaches such as imaginative abstracts help scholars outline some of the stakes and possibili - ties of established participatory methods . Participation can take many forms and invite diferent levels of participation by research partners , depending on the setting . When thinking about whether and how to apply PD methodologies to M / D / OH research topics , our analysis suggests that scholars consider the positionality of both the researcher and the research partners when evaluating the power dynamics at play . We fnd that PD research in these con - texts that undertakes a refexive approach , as previously argued in [ 44 ] , might productively expand this refexivity to incorporate refection on the kinds of participant voices being foregrounded . This accounting for varied positioning around participation recalls 1733 PD and Power in M / D / OH Research DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA a form of Arnstein’s Ladder [ 11 ] , a framework originally used to describe levels of engagement with communities in urban plan - ning ( from non - participation to citizen control ) . Our analysis does not ofer specifc prescriptions for how to navigate these tensions when combining participatory design methods with the M / D / OH context ; instead , we argue that what is most critical is to refect on these tensions before and throughout engaging with participants in these contexts . Though an inherent feature and strength of par - ticipatory methods is that they can lead to outcomes unanticipated by researchers , it is nevertheless prudent to think through how to scope a participatory project to minimize the potential harms of this work . In closing , we “zoom out” from our analysis of specifc value tensions to show how these tensions refect three central method - ological risks with combining the research areas of participatory design of interactive systems , design fction , and M / D / OH research : ( 1 ) considerations for using PD for M / D / OH , ( 2 ) the fraught char - acter of designing “with” ( or against ) hate , and ( 3 ) the challenges of using design fction in M / D / OH contexts . Finally , we refect on some directions for future work that could build of of this area . 6 . 1 Participatory Design in Misinformation , Disinformation , and Hate Contexts From our analysis we see how PD may provide important advan - tages to the felds of M / D / OH research by expanding the kinds of questions and insights proposed and the variety of solutions gener - ated . But these insights and solutions vary widely depending on the kind of community PD engages . When working with manipulated target communities , whether or not the researchers are members of these communities , it is important to refect on the ways that our work might add to stigmatizations of these communities ( as prior qualitative research ethics papers have argued , e . g . [ 51 , 92 ] ) , and to provide these participants agency in the PD process . When working with denigrated targets , we believe it is worth refecting on how to perform work that does not enlarge the targets on their backs , and make them more vulnerable to future harm through increasing their visibility ( as previously described in e . g . [ 83 , 97 , 104 ] ) . We also believe it is important for PD researchers in M / D / OH contexts to surface and consider how engaging a community in participatory design for research might compromise their work either now or in the future — e . g . working with moderators in such a way that would allow critics ( whether in good faith or bad ) to confate all modera - tion with censorship , in something akin to the “Twitter Files” [ 75 ] — and to weigh and / or mitigate these risks in the research design . Sometimes , the benefts of doing the research might not outweigh those risks . When we consider adapting PD methods to study spreading communities of M / D / OH , this research methodology becomes par - ticularly fraught . As Théophile Lenoir and Chris Anderson surface and problematize in their introductory essay to the “What Comes After Disinformation” volume [ 74 ] , research on M / D / OH topics in recent years has often built , either implicitly or explicitly , atop assumptions that truth is normatively good and that manipulation is normatively bad . This grounding can make tensions surrounding deception and power in research methods especially salient . From this position , sustained deception in a research study — such as Abstract 3’s fctional study with white nationalists — would vio - late this normative ground . Utilizing deception could undermine trust in the research team’s work , as well as the broader feld , and potentially science as a whole . Prior work where researchers used sockpuppet accounts to attempt to measure the impact of online infuence operations was subjected to extensive criticism from both good - faith and bad - faith actors , and undermined confdence in the feld [ 107 ] . Along these same lines , Thomas Rid , a scholar of Soviet active measures , has argued that countries that ascribe to demo - cratic values cannot use active measures such as disinformation without undermining the very values they are ostensibly defend - ing [ 102 ] . Researchers seeking to uphold liberal democratic values against misinformation and disinformation similarly cannot utilize sustained deception in understanding these phenomena without un - dermining their commitments . However , these value commitments and prioritizations ( for example , truth as a primary commitment over justice as a primary commitment ) are not necessarily universal in M / D / OH research . In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine , some M / D researchers and journalists on the misinformation beat ( e . g . [ 114 ] ) grappled with how to approach reporting on “the Ghost of Kyiv” — a likely false story of Ukrainian heroism , but one that was motivating Ukrainian resistance . A recent volume , “What Comes After Disinformation” [ 79 ] articulates a range of value tensions that complicate the “truth - frst” grounding . All of this underscores how important it is that PD researchers in M / D / OH contexts who intend to use deception surface their value commitments and carefully think through how the use of deception , or even the appearance of deception , could be weaponized to delegitimize a specifc study — and / or the broader feld . In writing this paper as scholars from distinct ( PD and M / D / OH ) scholarly communities , we additionally refected on the kinds of language taken up to describe M / D / OH activities and partners . For example , M / D / OH scholars frequently rely on militaristic terms such as “perpetrator , ” “target , ” “information operation , ” “bombarded , ” and “infltrate” to describe the varied actions and actors in these settings . Through our analysis , we began to notice these terms challenge the care politics of PD scholarship , prompting new re - fections on what those concepts assume and how greater nuance and accountability can be brought to our interpretations through writing . 6 . 2 The Fraught Character of Designing “with” ( or against ) Hate Our analysis has raised important questions around not only the risks of participation but also the risks of this very thought ex - periment . To what extent is our analysis of PD in complex and harmful situations of M / D / OH drawing more attention to the very patterns we hope to upend ? What more do we expect from a PD study focused on hate , from turning design scholars’ gaze toward harm ? What is the cost and to whom ? These questions begin to trouble how we scope our speculative project . To probe the study of structural harm is to ask whose voices design researchers elevate and obscure , and to reveal inherent prob - lems with treating hateful contexts as the focus / target of design . A range of feminist and anti - racist scholarship has convincingly ar - gued for not centering the actions and perspectives of those already 1734 DIS ’23 , July 10 – 14 , 2023 , Pitsburgh , PA , USA Joseph Schafer et al . wielding power , including the hate groups described in Abstract 3 . Denise Ferreira da Silva [ 34 ] , for example , astutely suggests that the unpacking of the philosophy behind racism can also work to reinforce racist beliefs . Within our analysis of PD , particularly Ab - stract 3 , we see a similar potential . Explanations of the philosophy behind hate groups or other hostile settings may serve to further entrench hateful ideology . It may also make way for the kind of vitriolic analysis of pain , disillusionment , and terror transnational feminist and Black studies scholars have long worked to dismantle . In partial response to these concerns , PD scholars may assume a position of ‘participatory design against’ to actively undermine harmful activity . Such an approach might involve researchers using fndings from PD activities to counter or push back against harmful activity within a study setting . These possibilities trouble the under - lying values and commitments of participatory work , identifying tensions between egalitarian and justice - oriented outcomes ( dis - cussed above ) . In light of previous work that has turned to PD and other design - based practices as ways of generating new insights in M / D / OH contexts ( e . g . [ 12 , 32 , 76 , 116 , 124 , 128 ] ) , our analy - sis invites scholars to look beyond the limited scope of M / D / OH scholarship to consider new and emergent PD techniques not as solutions but as methodological horizons to which we might hold ourselves accountable . 6 . 3 Design Fiction and M / D / OH Research A fnal central concern that surfaced in our analysis concerns the imaginary method abstracts and the risk of unintended harm . We worried in particular about the risks of their recontextualization — a particularly acute concern in “adversarial” research spaces such as disinformation and online hate , where the individuals and or - ganizations implicated in the study of these phenomena can also turn those tactics onto the researchers studying them . In terms of both the value tensions of authenticity and impact , thinking about how the fndings of research in this area might be reconstrued or represented in other settings were signifcant concerns we surfaced when thinking about applying PD methods to M / D / OH contexts . With further refection , our fears of recontextualization extend not just to these hypothetical studies , but to this very paper . Near the end of the manuscript preparation phase , we decided to add the watermarks to our imaginary abstracts to prevent them from being recontextualized and used to support bad faith criticisms of the feld as though the fctional studies had already been done . We do not endorse the actual doing of the research described in any of the imaginary abstracts we produce , and indeed we explicitly argue Abstract 3 is likely incompatible with normative assumptions common in M / D / OH research . However , we also felt that without watermarking , it is all too easy to imagine that a screenshot of one of the abstracts could be weaponized as ‘evidence’ to attack adjacent community - based research . But our analysis has also shown how hypothetical studies such as imaginary method abstracts allow us to chart a variety of value tensions arising from potential PD studies , without running the ethical risks of conducting a study before fully evaluating its impli - cations . Additionally , we see that the imaginary methods abstracts allow for enough specifcity to consider some of the nuances of cases while allowing for fexibility to think through multiple poten - tial implementations . In this sense , design fction and speculative design have the ability to fulfll important roles in the M / D / OH space . Whether enabling a less risky form of exploring the ethics of a research space , as is done in this paper , envisioning speculative solutions to the challenges of M / D / OH , or imagining evolutions of these felds ‘after disinformation studies’ [ 74 ] , these methods can be quite illuminating . Much like the challenges we outline around backlashes , however , it is important to think about possible recon - textualizations when applying design fctions to M / D / OH topics , and presenting the outputs of this work in such a way to mitigate those threats . 6 . 4 Future Work While we are considering participatory methods in this paper , we did not conduct this study in a participatory manner . Future work might revisit and expand our analysis in partnership with groups already engaged in meaningful community - based practices around M / D / OH . For example , we might use participatory workshops with community partners to reveal the range of refection process the fctional abstracts elicit and how the refections map to the value tensions we identifed . Such research might focus on further refning the application of participatory approaches in a similar manner to Verena Fuchsberger et . al . ’s engagement of participants with fctional job postings to refect on future work conditions [ 50 ] , or Stephanie Ballard et . al . ’s work with designers combining value - sensitive design and design fction to surface ethical concerns with technology [ 15 ] . Regardless of the form , we urge scholars to thoughtfully consider how to make sure that fctional abstracts would not be misinterpreted as existing studies within these en - gagements . Additionally , as community - engaged research gains traction within M / D / OH research and in designing systems to ad - dress these phenomena , reviews of existing literature should be done to see how these tensions are considered and addressed by existing researchers and practitioners . 7 CONCLUSION In this paper , we have used design fction to create imaginary method abstracts to explore the viability of using PD methodologies for studying topics of misinformation , disinformation , and online hate . We fnd three value tensions— authenticity , reciprocity , and impact — particularly salient when evaluating whether and how to conduct PD research on these topics , and outline some of the oppor - tunities and challenges associated with each tension . We conclude that PD designers and researchers working in M / D / OH contexts should refect carefully on the kinds of participation that best suit their specifc research questions and context , both involving the po - sitionality of the researchers and participants , as well as the degree to which PD participants have the capacity to participate .
