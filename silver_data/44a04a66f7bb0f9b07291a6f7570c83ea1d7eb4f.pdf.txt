C . Lubensky , University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia , PA , and approved August 13 , 2013 ( received for review November 28 , 2012 ) Chromatin structure and dynamics control all aspects of DNA biology yet are poorly understood , especially at large length scales . We developed an approach , displacement correlation spec - troscopy based on time - resolved image correlation analysis , to map chromatin dynamics simultaneously across the whole nucleus in cultured human cells . This method revealed that chromatin movement was coherent across large regions ( 4 – 5 μ m ) for several seconds . Regions of coherent motion extended beyond the bound - aries of single - chromosome territories , suggesting elastic coupling of motion over length scales much larger than those of genes . These large - scale , coupled motions were ATP dependent and uni - directional for several seconds , perhaps accounting for ATP - depen - dent directed movement of single genes . Perturbation of major nuclear ATPases such as DNA polymerase , RNA polymerase II , and topoisomerase II eliminated micron - scale coherence , while causing rapid , local movement to increase ; i . e . , local motions ac - celerated but became uncoupled from their neighbors . We observe similar trends in chromatin dynamics upon inducing a direct DNA damage ; thus we hypothesize that this may be due to DNA dam - age responses that physically relax chromatin and block long - dis - tance communication of forces . self - organization | active materials | soft matter T he structure and dynamics of interphase chromatin are major unsolved questions in the biology of eukaryotic cells . Chro - matin is composed of DNA wrapped around nucleosomes made of core histones ( H2A , H2B , H3 , and H4 ) , but its structure at larger length scales is controversial ( 1 ) . Despite the lack of physical compartmentalization of the nucleus , chromatin appears to be highly organized . Single chromosomes occupy distinct territories in the 3D landscape of the nucleus ( 2 – 4 ) . Chromatin cross - linking is starting to reveal complex patterns of genome folding with 1 - Mbp resolution ( 5 ) , but this provides a static picture , and the organization of interphase chromatin is highly dynamic in living cells ( 6 – 9 ) : Chromosomes with active genes tend to locate in the nuclear interior , whereas chromosomes with inactive genes reside mostly at the nuclear periphery . Further , active genes tend to locate toward the surface of chromosome territories , whereas the silenced genes tend to remain inside territories . Moreover , in the case of gene coregulation two distinct genes share the same transcription factor , which requires them to be in close proximity ( 6 ) . In general , it is not clear to what extent gene activity in ﬂ uences gene position or gene position dictates the gene activity . This question is complicated by gene expression and gene localization changes as a function of cell type , cell cycle state , and response to exogenous stimuli ( 6 – 11 ) . Because all these factors act on gene dynamics , it is likely dynamic measurements methods will be required to resolve the activity – position problem for genes . In addition to gene repositioning , chromatin remodeling , i . e . , local dynamic modi ﬁ cations of chromatin architecture , contrib - utes to chromatin ’ s complex dynamics ( 6 , 7 ) . Chromatin remod - eling plays an epigenetic regulatory role in all DNA manipulations , e . g . , gene transcription , replication , DNA repair , apoptosis , or development ( 12 ) , which are again all dynamic processes of their own , powered by different ATP - dependent nuclear enzymes ( e . g . , RNA polymerase , helicase , etc . ) . Clearly , chromatin dynamics are very complex and contain many layers of convoluted dynamic processes operating at different timescales and length scales . To date , studies of chromatin dynamics consist largely of photobleaching ( 13 – 16 ) and photoactivation techniques ( 17 , 18 ) , which visualize turnover of nuclear proteins and movement of whole sections of the nucleus , and tracking of chromatin - attached single particles to quantify movement dynamics ( 19 – 30 ) . Single particles within chromatin that have been tracked include ﬂ uo - rescently labeled single - DNA sites ( 19 – 22 ) , nuclear proteins ( 23 – 26 ) , chromosome territories ( 27 , 28 ) and subchromosomal foci ( 29 , 30 ) . These studies revealed dynamics that can be largely described as diffusive or subdiffusive with constraint , with few instances showing an apparent directional movement for single genes ( 19 , 20 ) . How to reconcile these static and dynamic pic - tures to provide a physical picture of the interphase nucleus is unclear . The physical nature of a bulk material cannot be un - derstood from tracking single points within it , but approaches for probing bulk chromatin dynamics in vivo have lagged ( 14 ) . Here , we map chromatin dynamics across the entire nucleus and follow the spatiotemporal evolution of the global chromatin dynamics in vivo in nuclei of human HeLa cells . To monitor chromatin dynamics simultaneously across an entire eukaryotic nucleus we imaged GFP - tagged histone H2B , a widely used and reliable reporter of chromatin position ( 16 ) . Positional ﬂ uctua - tions in the local intensity of H2B - GFP report directly on posi - tional ﬂ uctuations of chromatin ( Fig . 1 A ) . We recorded 25 - s sequences of H2B - GFP imaged by confocal microscopy in a sin - gle plane , typically in the middle of the nucleus , at fairly high resolution ( ∼ 65 nm in x and y , 250 ms per frame ) . Our analytic Signi ﬁ cance Chromatin , the functional form of DNA inside the cell nucleus , has been heavily studied using biochemical and genetic methods , but we still know little about its large - scale organi - zation and even less about its dynamics . We present a unique method , displacement correlation spectroscopy ( DCS ) , which allows us to map interphase chromatin dynamics simulta - neously across the entire nucleus and follow the temporal evolution of the global chromatin dynamics in vivo . Using DCS we discovered that chromatin moves coherently across micron - scale regions for a few seconds , which implies a transient mechanical coupling between chromatin on different chromo - somes . This coupling might allow different regions of the nucleus to communicate by a unique , mechanochemical mechanism , e . g . , to coordinate responses to DNA damage . Author contributions : A .

Cross - correlation between pairs of images reported on local chromatin displacements between time intervals , and varying their time interval sampled all time intervals in the ex - periment , typically from 250 ms to 25 s ( Materials and Methods ) . Results and Discussion To obtain a spatiotemporal evolution of chromatin dynamics across an entire nucleus we used a unique approach we termed DCS ( Materials and Methods and Fig . S1 ) . We ﬁ rst calculated mean square network displacement ( MSND ) as a function of time , which we de ﬁ ned as MSND ( Δ t ) = < j d → ( r → , Δ t ) j 2 > , where d → ( r → , Δ t ) are displacements measured by DCS , averaging across 16 nuclei ( Fig . 1 C ) . We found that MSND follows a power law , f ð Δ t Þ = A + B Δ t α ; [ 1 ] the best ﬁ t yielding A = 0 . 00297 ± 0 . 00012 μ m 2 , B = 0 . 00128 ± 0 . 00011 μ m 2 · s − 1 , and α = 0 . 71 ± 0 . 03 ( Fig . 1 C ) . Interestingly , our model required a constant A to account for the initial jump of MSND at short times . As a positive control we measured MSND for mitotic chromosomes ( Fig . 1 B ) , which are known to undergo larger movements ( 31 ) , and found consistent with pre - vious observations that MSND values for mitotic chromosomes are much larger than MSND of interphase chromatin ( Fig . 1 C ) . MSND measured for cells ﬁ xed in formaldehyde revealed much lower MSND values , con ﬁ rming that measured values were above the noise ﬂ oor for the instrument and analysis method ( Fig . 1 C ) . The constant A might therefore account for another , superimposed type of chromatin ﬂ uctuations characterized by shorter timescales . Consistent with previous work , the ﬁ t and parameter values were reminiscent of mean square displacement ( MSD ) for single , tagged genes measured at high temporal res - olution ( ∼ 30 ms ) ( 19 ) , where the ﬁ rst term was described by another type of movement , constrained fast diffusion , superim - posed on the slower motion , which was freely diffusive , unlike subdiffusive in our case . Their model for single - genes movement yielded B = 0 . 00096 μ m 2 · s − 1 , assuming free diffusion ( α = 1 ) ( 19 ) . The fast motion at the short times is also consistent with recently observed local nucleosome dynamics ( 32 ) . Thus , where a direct comparison between DCS and previous methods was possible , the results were similar . Unlike previous methods , DCS tracked chromatin simulta - neously in the whole nucleus with subpixel spatial resolution , so we were able to ask whether chromatin motion was spatially correlated over any time interval in our data . We ﬁ rst plotted d → ( r → , Δ t ) maps of movement for different intervals , color coding displacement vectors by direction to reveal directional correla - tion . At time intervals < 0 . 5 s the maps contained mostly un - correlated displacements ( Fig . 2 A ) . Small patches of displacements of the same directions were caused partly by overlap of the in - terrogation windows for local image correlation in our technique ( Materials and Methods ) . At intervals of ∼ 1 – 10 s the maps re - peatedly revealed large regions of similar color , i . e . , locally correlated motions ( Fig . 2 B – D ) . These regions typically spanned several micrometers . Importantly , the appearance of these re - gions was independent of the size and overlap of the interro - gation windows used by DCS ( Materials and Methods ) , thus ruling out a measurement artifact . Different regions in the same nucleus underwent correlated movement in different directions ( Fig . 2 B – D ) , so the maps were not reporting translation or ro - tation of the entire nucleus , but rather relative displacements of regions within a single nucleus . Sequential maps of the same nucleus showed that regions of correlated movement did not persist ( Fig . 2 D ) . Instead , over tens of seconds they broke up , reversed , or in other ways appeared to randomize . Thus , motion was not coherent or unidirectional over long timescales , but it was strikingly correlated over microns and tens of seconds . To quantify spatial correlation of motions we computed the spatial autocorrelation function c dx ( Δ r → , Δ t ) = < d x ( r → , Δ t ) , d x ( r → + Δ r → , Δ t ) > for the x - component d x of the measured displacements d → ( r → , Δ t ) . Fig . 2 E shows a plot of radially averaged < c dx ( Δ r , Δ t ) > for different Δ t , where < > denotes the average over all c dx ( Δ r , Δ t ) obtained for all DCS ﬁ elds at given Δ t . These traces quantify an unprecedented type of dynamics . For time intervals between 0 . 25 s and 5 s , spatial correlation in movement increases with increasing time . Correlation reaches a maximum at 5 – 10 s and then decreases again . These curves are consistent with visual inspection of maps ( Fig . 2 A – D ) . Regions of correlated motion were most evident for 5 - to 10 - s intervals and became less evi - dent for shorter and longer intervals . To investigate the time - dependent behavior of < c dx ( Δ r , Δ t ) > , we analyzed every c dx ( Δ r , Δ t ) separately ( Fig . 2 F ) . We found that c dx ( Δ r , Δ t ) of a single DCS ﬁ eld shows an initial power law behavior followed by an abrupt fall consistent with a power law with an exponential cutoff . We ﬁ tted c dx ( Δ r , Δ t ) to f ð Δ r Þ = A ð Δ r Þ n e − Δ r = ξ : [ 2 ] This ﬁ t yielded an average exponent n ≈ − 0 . 5 for all times and ξ having a time - dependent behavior : increasing for 0 . 25 – 5 s , reach - ing its maximum ξ ≈ 5 μ m at 5 – 10 s , and then decreasing again ( Fig . 2 G ) . Time - dependent behavior of ξ provides a direct mea - sure of the lifetime of the correlated motion τ ∼ 10 s . Both the correlation length ξ and the lifetime of the correlated motion τ agree with visual inspection of vector maps for 2 . 5 - to 10 - s cor - relation intervals , where regions of correlated motion are of the same order . One potential explanation of correlated motion on the micron scale is that single chromosomes in their interphase territories tend to move as a single unit . The observed correlation length ξ ≈ 5 μ m is comparable to the size of single - chromosome terri - tories seen previously in ﬁ xed cells by ﬂ uorescence in situ hybrid - ization ( FISH ) ( 2 ) . To test this , we visualized territories , using a published method ( 33 ) in which DNA strands were labeled during replication with Cy3 - dCTP and then diluted with un - labeled strands by allowing cell division without label ( Fig . 3 B ) . We then overlaid DCS - derived maps of histone H2B - GFP move - ment with Cy3 - dCTP marked territories ( Fig . 3 D ) . We found Fig . 1 . Bulk chromatin dynamics .

MSND measured for cells ﬁ xed in formaldehyde ( gray circles ) reveals much lower MSND values , thus con ﬁ rming that measured values are above the noise ﬂ oor .

We conclude that regions of correlated motion are not chromo - some territories in most cases . Fig . 3 E and F provide a cartoon view of our data ; yellow arrows denote motion within the regions of coherent motion ( red or blue box ) , and green and blue circles denote neighboring territories . To explore the origin and organization underlying the correlated motion we investigated its ATP dependence . ATP depletion blocked correlation in bulk chromatin dynamics completely . It also strongly reduced all movement . MSND ( t ) shows a strong reduction in measured displacements , yielding A = 0 . 00199 ± 0 . 00014 μ m 2 and α = 0 . 32 ± 0 . 03 , when ﬁ tted to Eq . 1 ( Fig . 4 G ) , averaging across 10 nuclei . The exponent α is strongly reduced . In addition to a re - duction in the extent of the motion , we observed an apparent chromatin condensation in images ( Fig . 4 B ) , which concurs with overall higher compaction reported earlier by ﬂ uorescence lifetime imaging microscopy ( FLIM ) - FRET studies ( 34 ) . Thus , chromatin requires ATP to preserve its spread out , dynamic state . The mechanochemical origin of chromatin movement is un - clear . Lack of an effect of microtubule - and actin - targeting drugs showed that motion is generated within the nucleus and not by the action of cytoplasmic motors on the nuclear periphery ( Fig . S5 ) . As a start to investigating regulation and function of cor - related motion of chromatin , we investigated the effect of drugs that target important nuclear enzymes : aphidicolin ( DNA poly - merase inhibitor ) , α - amanitin ( RNA polymerase II inhibitor ) , and ICRF - 193 ( topoisomerase II inhibitor ) . In addition to inhibiting different nuclear enzymes with high speci ﬁ city , these drugs all trigger DNA damage responses ( 35 – 37 ) . We ﬁ rst de - termined their effects on chromatin architecture by measuring homogeneity in local density of H2B - GFP , from spatial variance σ 2 of the ﬂ uorescence intensity ( Fig . 4 C – F ) . As previously reported , DNA - damaging drugs caused chromatin to become Fig . 2 . Local coherence in interphase chromatin dynamics .

( E ) We calculate average spatial displacement autocorrelation function < c dx ( Δ r , Δ t ) > for a Δ t by averaging over all c dx ( Δ r , Δ t ) calculated for single DCS ﬁ elds at given Δ t . The plot shows < c dx ( Δ r , Δ t ) > for different Δ t . First , an increase in correlation can be observed for Δ t = 0 . 25 – 5 s , then the correlation reaches its maximum at Δ t = 5 – 10 s , and then it decreases again .

PNAS Early Edition | 3 of 6 A PP L I E D P H Y S I C A L S C I E N C E S more diffuse and homogeneous in staining , the opposite of the effect of ATP depletion ( 34 , 38 , 39 ) . For aphidicolin the effect was seen in only ∼ 35 % of cells . We suspected this is the fraction of cells that is undergoing DNA replication and tested it by in - corporating EdU for 1 h to mark replicating cells ( 40 ) , then adding aphidicolin , and then measuring chromatin morphology and EdU incorporation . All of the cells where chromatin became more homogeneous ( lowered σ 2 ) had been replicating ( n = 23 of 67 ) , con ﬁ rming that aphidicolin ’ s effect on chromatin structure , and therefore presumably on dynamics , is S - phase speci ﬁ c ( Fig . S6 ) . Analysis of H2B - GFP image sequences with DCS revealed that all three drugs caused strong inhibition of local coherence , and all three drugs increased local displacements ( Fig . 4 G ) ; i . e . , local motions were accelerated but became uncoupled from their neighbors ( Fig . 4 H – K ) . MSND ( t ) ﬁ tted to Eq . 1 yielded A = 0 . 00324 ± 0 . 00012 μ m 2 and α = 0 . 52 ± 0 . 012 for aphidicolin , A = 0 . 00363 ± 0 . 00014 μ m 2 and α = 0 . 59 ± 0 . 02 for α - amanitin , and A = 0 . 00285 ± 0 . 00024 μ m 2 and α = 0 . 53 ± 0 . 02 for ICRF - 193 . We ﬁ nd similar behavior upon inducing direct DNA damage by treating the cells with neocarzinostatin ( NCS ) , which causes DNA double - strand breaks directly , yielding A = 0 . 00338 ± 0 . 00016 μ m 2 and α = 0 . 59 ± 0 . 02 for MSND ( t ) ﬁ tted to Eq . 1 ( Fig . S8 ) . These data can be interpreted in two ways : Decreased condensation of chromatin , caused by the DNA damage re - sponse , may remove the physical links needed for coordination of motion over microns . Alternatively , decreased coordination may cause a decrease in condensation . In either case , our data revealed a unique aspect of how chromatin responds to DNA damage at a physical level . To decouple the contribution of the DNA damage response from loss of function of the drug target ( DNA polymerase , RNA polymerase II , and topoisomerase II ) , we blocked ATR kinase and Chk1 by speci ﬁ c inhibitors VE - 821 and Chir 124 , respectively . These experiments revealed that ATR kinase activity was required for normal dynamics even in unperturbed cells ; although blocking of ATR kinase and Chk1 did not in ﬂ uence the amplitude of local displacements , it did strongly inhibit the local coherence in chromatin dynamics ( Fig . S9 ) . This ﬁ nding is consistent with our hypothesis that DNA damage and ATR activity in ﬂ uence coherence of chromatin dynamics , but made it dif ﬁ cult to separate direct vs . indirect effects of inhibiting nuclear enzymes . Conclusions Our ﬁ ndings reveal a unique type of active movement in chro - matin and raise the puzzling question of how microscopic forces couple over long distances to generate coherent movement . We suspect elastic coupling , which could generate coherent motion by at least two mechanisms : passive , where active motors in a small region push or pull on a larger region that responds pas - sively , and self - organized , where forces serve to align , or activate prealigned , motors at a distance ( 41 , 42 ) . Self - organized motion of an active material is intriguing because it can give rise to complex behavior such as oscillations and traveling waves ( 43 , 44 ) . Chromatin - remodeling ATPases , which act on regions of high local curvature where DNA bends around nucleosomes ( 12 ) , are interesting candidates for sensing force as well as generating it . Illuminating the physical nature of global chromatin dynamics is critical for understanding collective gene behavior and the underlying DNA biology . The biological function of coherent chromatin motion is un - clear ; coherency might be functional or merely an epiphenomenon of dynamic organization . It is clearly an active , ATP - dependent , inherent attribute of global chromatin dynamics and therefore likely to impact on nuclear processes such as DNA replication , gene expression , and maintenance of genomic integrity . We ﬁ nd several different perturbations that cause similar loss of local coherence . The common factor is that all trigger DNA damage responses or , in the case of ATR inhibitors , detect and regulate damage responses . Loss of coherence in motion in DNA - damaged nuclei could be caused by global physical changes in chromatin ( 45 ) , which might be needed to relax chromatin . We speculate that chromatin relaxation minimizes the effect of DNA damage by mechanically isolating the damage site through global loss of elastic coupling . More speculatively , coherent motion might serve to communicate information across the nucleus and thus help the nucleus mount an integrated response to DNA damage or physical deformation . Materials and Methods Cell Culture . HeLa cells ( CCL - 2 ) were cultured according to the ATTC recom - mendations . The HeLa H2B - GFP line was a gift from James Orth ( Harvard Medical School ) . Cells were cultured in a humidi ﬁ ed , 5 % CO 2 ( vol / vol ) at - mosphere at 37 °C in Gibco Dulbecco ’ s modi ﬁ ed eagle medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % FBS ( vol / vol ) , 100 units / mL penicillin , and 100 mg / mL streptomycin ( Invitrogen ) . Cells were plated 24 h before the experiment on 35 - mm MatTek dishes with glass bottom no . 1 . 5 ( MatTek ) . Before the experiment the medium was replaced by Gibco CO 2 - independent medium supplemented with L - glutamine ( Invitrogen ) . Cells were then mounted on the microscope stage kept in a custom - built 37 °C microscope incubator enclosure with 5 % CO 2 ( vol / vol ) delivery during the entire experiment . Chromosome Staining .

S - phase – speci ﬁ c staining was achieved using click chemistry as de - scribed previously ( 40 ) . We incubated cells for 1 h with EdU before ﬁ xation . Alexa 555 azide ( Invitrogen ) was used as a ﬂ uorophore in the click reaction . Microscopy and Image Acquisition . Images were acquired with a Yokogawa CSU - X1 spinning - disk confocal head with an internal motorized high - speed emission ﬁ lter wheel and Spectral Applied Research Borealis modi ﬁ cation for increased light throughput and illumination homogeneity on a Nikon Ti inverted microscope equipped with a 100 × Plan Apo NA 1 . 4 objective lens and the Perfect Focus System for continuous maintenance of focus . The microscope is mounted on a TMC vibration - isolation table . H2B - GFP ﬂ uo - rescence was excited with a 491 - nm solid state laser [ controlled with an acousto - optic tunable ﬁ lter ( AOTF ) ] and collected with a 405 / 491 / 561 / 642 multibandpass dichroic mirror ( Semrock ) and an ET525 / 50 emission ﬁ lter ( Chroma Technology ) . Images were acquired with a Hamamatsu ORCA - AG cooled CCD camera controlled with MetaMorph 7 ( Molecular Devices ) soft - ware . No binning was used ; the pixel size for the 100 × objective was 0 . 065 μ m . The stream acquisitions were collected using an exposure time of 250 ms for H2B - GFP . For ﬁ xed samples we also used a Nikon TE - 2000 microscope with a Yokogawa CSU10 spinning - disk confocal head equipped with a 100 × Plan Apo NA 1 . 4 objective lens , the Perfect Focus System , a 491 - nm solid state laser ( controlled with an AOTF ) and an Andor iXon 897 camera con - trolled by MetaMorph7 at binning 2 , pixel size 0 . 107 μ m , and exposure of 300 ms . Little bleaching was observed , as determined by a lack of decrease in average intensity during measurements . The streams of 16 - bit images were saved as multitiff stacks . Images were converted to single - tiff images and analyzed in MatLab ( The MathWorks ) as described below .

Shown are changes in phenotype upon perturbations : ( A – E ) control ( A ) ; after ATP depletion ( B ) ; and upon addition of ICRF - 193 ( topoisomerase II inhibitor ) ( C ) , α - amanitin ( polymerase II inhibitor ) ( D ) , and aphidicolin ( DNA polymerase inhibitor ) ( E ) . ( F ) Histograms of normalized intensities for A – E demonstrate the difference in the variance σ 2 of ﬂ uorescence intensity distributions corresponding to changes in chromatin concentration distributions .

( G ) MSND measured for aphidicolin ( n = 15 ) , ICRF - 193 ( n = 9 ) , and α - amanitin ( n = 9 ) shows an increase in local displacements , whereas ATP depletion ( n = 10 ) causes a reduction in local displacements . As a negative control we measured displacement in a sample ﬁ xed by formaldehyde ( n = 5 ) . Note the S - phase – speci ﬁ c behavior of cells treated with aphidicolin ; cells in S phase ( pink circles ) react to aphidicolin perturbation , whereas cells not in S phase ( purple circles ) retain physiological behavior . All three drugs cause strong inhibition of local coherence : ( H ) ICRF - 193 , ( I ) α - amanitin , and ( J ) aphidicolin . For aphidicolin the effect is seen only in ∼ 35 % of cells , which are shown by EdU stain to be in early - to - mid S phase , con ﬁ rming the aphidicolin effect is S - phase speci ﬁ c ( Fig . S6 ) .

Typically , DCS calculations for one nucleus and a stream of 25 s containing 100 frames lasted ∼ 5 h . Speci ﬁ cally , the calculation of displacement ﬁ elds was carried out using the MatPiv 1 . 60 package ( 46 ) ( a GNU public license software , http : / / folk . uio . no / jks / matpiv / index2 . html ) for MatLab ( The MathWorks ) in combination with custom - made MatLab routines . We used 16 × 16 pixel interrogation windows with an overlap of 75 % to provide high - resolution information . The calculations were also tested for interrogation windows of 32 × 32 pixels and 64 × 64 pixels , with overlap 0 – 75 % , and the presence of correlated motion was con ﬁ rmed here . The displacement ﬁ elds were calculated for all time intervals accessible in the experiment , typically 250 ms to 25 s . The resulting displacement ﬁ elds were ﬁ ltered using ﬁ lters “ snr ﬁ lt ” , “ pkh ﬁ lt ” , and “ glob ﬁ lt ” from the MatPiv 1 . 60 package , evaluating signal - to - noise ratio , peak height of correlation functions , and global velocity distribution to remove spurious vectors . We used custom - made MatLab code to calculate spatial displacement autocorrelation function c dx ( Δ r → , Δ t ) = < d x ( r → , Δ t ) , d x ( r → + Δ r → , Δ t ) > for the x - component d x of the measured displacements d → ( r → , Δ t ) . There was no noticeable difference when calculated for the y - component . We calculate c dx ( Δ r , Δ t ) for every displacement ﬁ eld at all Δ t and then ﬁ t the radially av - eraged c dx ( Δ r , Δ t ) to a power law with an exponential cutoff f ( Δ r ) = A ( Δ r ) n e − Δ r / ξ , using custom - made MatLab code . Thus , we obtain scaling exponent n and correlation length ξ for every displacement ﬁ eld separately and then com - pute average n and ξ for given Δ t . To evaluate the average extent of the spatial correlation in the displacement ﬁ elds we calculate average spatial displacement autocorrelation function < c dx ( Δ r , Δ t ) > , for a Δ t by averaging over all c dx ( Δ r , Δ t ) calculated for single DCS ﬁ elds at given Δ t . MSND was calculated from the displacements d → ( r → , Δ t ) obtained in step i for every Δ t over the entire image sequence , MSND ( Δ t ) = < j d → ( r → , Δ t ) j 2 > , and ﬁ tted using custom - made MatLab code to f ( Δ t ) = A + B Δ t α .
