Exposure , 32 epidemiologic , demographic information were retrospectively collected by a structured questionnaire . 33 Medical records were also reviewed for clinical characteristics and CT images in HCWs . 34 Results : As of April 18 , 2020 , a total of 424 HCWs were identified . Among them , 276 ( 65 . 1 % ) were 35 symptomatic and 148 ( 34 . 9 % ) were asymptomatic . 55 ( 19 . 9 % ) families of the symptomatic HCWs and 36 16 ( 10 . 8 % ) families of the asymptomatic HCWs were infected with SARS - CoV - 2 . HCWs with infected 37 family members tend to be symptomatic cases ( Odds ratio [ OR ] , 2 . 053 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , 38 1 . 130 - 3 . 730 ] ; P = 0 . 018 ) . Multivariable logistic regression analysis exhibited that performing tracheal 39 intubation or extubation ( OR , 4 . 057 [ 95 % CI , 1 . 183 - 13 . 909 ] ; P = 0 . 026 ) was associated with an 40 increased likelihood of symptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection , while consistent use of N95 respirators 41 ( OR , 0 . 369 [ 95 % CI , 0 . 201 - 0 . 680 ] ; P = 0 . 001 ) and eye protection ( OR , 0 . 217 [ 95 % CI , 0 . 116 - 0 . 404 ] ; 42 P < 0 . 001 ) were associated with an increased likelihood of asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection . 43 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 3 Conclusions : Asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection in HCWs occupies a considerable proportion 44 during the pandemic of COVID - 19 . Those who have performed tracheal intubation or extubation were 45 most likely to develop related symptoms , while those taking aggressive measures including consistent 46 use of N95 masks , and eye protection tended to be asymptomatic cases . 47 Introduction 48 The ongoing outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease ( COVID - 19 ) has been reported in Wuhan , 49 China and spread rapidly across the world . 1 , 2 Health - care workers ( HCWs ) have been at high risk for 50 developing COVID - 19 though nosocomial infection during the pandemic . Until April 15 , 2020 , a total 51 of 6764 asymptomatic patients with COVID - 19 had been reported in China . 3 The percentage of 52 asymptomatic infections among confirmed COVID - 19 patients were reported to be 7 . 9 % - 87 . 8 % , which 53 occupied a considerable proportion . 4 - 6 A previous study also demonstrated that among HCWs with 54 COVID - 19 , 8 / 19 ( 42 . 1 % ) were asymptomatic cases . 7 Clinical characteristics of patients with 55 asymptomatic vs symptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection have been previously compared . 8 However , the 56 factors associated with symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection are still unknown . In 57 this study , we investigated 148 asymptomatic and 276 symptomatic HCWs who either tested positive 58 for SARS - CoV - 2 nucleic acid or antibody . By comparing the differences in epidemiologic , 59 demographic and clinical features between asymptomatic and symptomatic HCWs , we hope to give 60 new insights into the transmission of SRAS - CoV - 2 among HCWs and offer some indirect evidence that 61 symptom severity may be associated with the initial infectious dose of SRAS - CoV - 2 . 62 Methods 63 Hospital setting and participants 64 This multi - center , retrospective , cohort study was conducted at Wuhan Union Hospital and Wuhan Red 65 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 Cross Hospital . This study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Union Hospital , 66 Tongji Medical College , Huazhong University of Science and Technology ( 20200036 ) and the 67 requirement for informed consent was exempted by the Ethics Committee . From December 31 , 2019 to 68 April 18 , 2020 , a total of 7733 and 820 HCWs had been working in Wuhan Union Hospital and Wuhan 69 Red Cross Hospital , respectively . Since March 18 , 2020 , all HCWs have been requested to receive 70 SARS - CoV - 2 nucleic acid and antibody detection before they returned to their original work . Those 71 HCWs who had been working in high - risk departments or had close contact with suspected or 72 confirmed COVID - 19 patients should also be subjected to chest CT scan . Until April 18 , 2020 , a total 73 of 5839 HCWs in Wuhan Union Hospital and 634 workers in Wuhan Red Cross Hospital were 74 subjected to SARS - CoV - 2 nucleic acid and antibody tests . 75 RNA Extraction , reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) assay and antibodies 76 test 77 The RNA extraction , RT - PCR assay and antibodies test were done according to the previous study . 9 . 78 Total RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal and / or oropharyngeal swab samples of HCWs within 2 79 hours using the respiratory sample RNA isolation kit ( Xi’an Tianlong Science and Technology CO . , Ltd . 80 and Guangzhou HEAS BioTech Co . , Ltd . ) . RT - PCR assay was performed by using detection kit for 81 SARS - CoV - 2 RNA ( Wuhan Easydiagnosis Biomedicine Co . , Ltd . and Daan Gene Co . , Ltd . of Sun 82 Yat - sen University ) . The serum SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies were detected using the diagnostic kit for IgM 83 / IgG antibody to SARS - CoV - 2 ( Zhuhai Livzon Diagnostics Inc . ) 84 Definitions 85 Isolation wards , fever outpatient clinics , emergency departments , ICU , medical laboratories , and 86 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 radiology departments were defined as high - risk departments given HCWs in these departments 87 inevitably contacted with probable and confirmed COVID - 19 patients and their specimens and were 88 always at high risk of exposure to SARS - CoV - 2 virus . The comorbidities in our study including 89 hypertension , cardiovascular disease , diabetes , cerebrovascular disease , chronic obstructive pulmonary 90 disease ( COPD ) , chronic kidney disease , chronic liver disease , rheumatic diseases and malignancy . 91 Data Collection 92 Exposure , epidemiologic , demographic information were retrospectively collected by a structured 93 questionnaire . All except one deceased HCW turned in their surveys and for the deceased HCW , his 94 colleagues were asked to help us with the questionnaire . Information about the frequency of hand 95 washing after making contact with confirmed or suspected COVID - 19 patients and the frequency of 96 using different types of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) ( never , sometimes , most of the time , or all 97 of the time ) was inquired for each HCW . Medical records were also reviewed for clinical 98 characteristics and CT images in HCWs . On January 27 , 2020 , we initiated the follow - up of infected 99 HCWs for the exposure history . Since then , once an infected HCW was reported , his / her contact and 100 exposure history would be established by interview and were recorded immediately . 101 Statistical analyses 102 To avoid overfitting in our multivariable model , we calculated the numbers of variables allowed to 103 enrolled in our logistic regression model based on a previous study for guidance on sample size 104 requirements for prediction models . 10 Considering a total number of 424 HCWs ( with 148 105 asymptomatic HCWs ) , 5 variables could be enrolled in the multivariable analyses . The events per 106 candidate predictor parameter ( EPP ) = 29 . 6 , the model could explain less than 15 % of the variability 107 with mean absolute percentage error ( MAPE ) less than 0 . 05 . 108 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 Variables included into the multivariable logistic regression model were selected based on the least 109 absolute shrinkage and selection operator ( LASSO ) regression and the previous evidence . 11 In LASSO 110 regression , the performance of the model was augmented with 10 - fold cross validation , and the 111 covariates were selected by minimum ( λ min ) . Among 16 variables ( including age , sex , job category , 112 comorbidities , tracheal intubation or extubation , conduct oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal examination , 113 sputum suction , cardiopulmonary resuscitation , hand washing , isolation gown , surgical mask or N95 114 respirators , N95 respirators , gloves , hair cover , and eye protection ) entered into the LASSO regression 115 model , 7 variables ( age , job category , comorbidities , tracheal intubation or extubation , N95 respirators , 116 hair cover and eye protection ) were available for the next step . A previous study had shown younger 117 age was associated with asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection . 8 Another study showed that age and 118 comorbidities were predictors for symptom development in the initially asymptomatic carriers at 119 admission . 12 Two studies showed that tracheal intubation procedure was related to increased risk of 120 transmission SARS - CoV - 1 and SARS - CoV - 2 to HCWs . 13 , 14 Face mask and eye protection especially 121 N95 respirators were most consistently with reduced COVID - 19 infection among HCWs . 14 , 15 Face 122 mask was also reported to be associated with asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection based on several 123 uncontrolled reports . 16 Therefore , we chose age , comorbidities , tracheal intubation or extubation , N95 124 respirators , eye protection as the five variables for our multivariable logistic regression model and were 125 adjusted by using an enter approach . 126 In the analysis , frequency of using PPE and frequency of hands hygiene practice were coded into 2 127 categories : used inconsistently ( i . e . , “never or sometimes used” ) or used consistently ( “used most or all 128 of the time” ) . Continuous and categorical variables were presented in median and interquartile range 129 ( IQR ) , or numbers and percentage ( % ) , respectively . Continuous variables were compared using 130 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 7 unpaired t test . Differences between proportions of categorical variables were assessed by the 131 chi - square tests or Fisher’s exact tests . Logistic regression model was used to calculate Odds ratio ( OR ) 132 and 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) for asymptomatic infection . A two - sided P value less than 0 . 05 was 133 considered as significant . The RStudio ( version 1 . 2 . 5033 ) package “glmnet” was used to perform the 134 LASSO regression . Other statistical analyses were performed by using SAS software package ( version 135 9 . 4 ) . 136 Results 137 Laboratory test of SARS - CoV - 2 138 After the outbreak of COVID - 19 , 424 / 8553 ( 5 . 0 % ) HCWs had laboratory evidence of SARS - CoV - 2 139 infection before April 18 , 2020 , with 326 / 7733 ( 4 . 2 % ) and 98 / 820 ( 12 . 0 % ) HCWs in Wuhan Union 140 Hospital and Wuhan Red Cross Hospital , respectively . Among them , 276 HCWs were symptomatic and 141 148 HCWs were asymptomatic . The laboratory tests of the 424 HCWs are shown in Table 1 . Of the 142 276 symptomatic HCWs , 236 had positive SARS - CoV - 2 nucleic acid test and 62 were specifically 143 positive for SARS - CoV - 2 antibody but negative for SARS - CoV - 2 nucleic acid . Among the 148 144 asymptomatic HCWs , 21 had positive SARS - CoV - 2 nucleic acid test , the remaining 127 HCWs were 145 specifically positive for SARS - CoV - 2 antibody but negative for SARS - CoV - 2 nucleic acid ( Figure 1 ) . 146 Demographic and clinical characteristics 147 The demographic and clinical characteristics are presented in Table 2 and Table S1 . The median age of 148 the 424 HCWs was 35 years old ( IQR , 30 . 0 - 42 . 0 ) , 286 ( 67 . 5 % ) of whom were female . No significant 149 differences were seen in age and sex between symptomatic and asymptomatic HCWs . Among the 424 150 HCWs , 136 ( 32 . 1 % ) worked in internal medicine , 112 ( 26 . 4 % ) in surgery department , 15 ( 3 . 5 % ) in 151 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 8 pediatrics department , 30 ( 7 . 1 % ) in the departments of obstetrics and gynecology and 131 ( 30 . 9 % ) in 152 other departments . Of the 424 HCWs , physicians were more likely to be symptomatic ( OR , 1 . 697 [ 95 % 153 CI , 1 . 065 - 2 . 704 ] ; P = 0 . 026 ) while health - care assistants were more likely to be asymptomatic ( OR , 154 0 . 594 [ 95 % CI , 0 . 366 - 0 . 964 ] ; P = 0 . 035 ) . Chest CT results are shown in Table 2 . Among the 142 155 asymptomatic HCWs undergoing CT scan , only 33 ( 23 . 2 % ) showed abnormal CT images , while 257 156 ( 93 . 1 % ) of the symptomatic HCWs showed abnormal chest CT images . More symptomatic HCWs 157 showed bilateral pulmonary infiltration than asymptomatic HCWs ( 180 / 257 vs 16 / 33 , P = 0 . 013 ) . 158 Compared with families of asymptomatic HCWs , more families of symptomatic HCWs were infected 159 with SARS - CoV - 2 ( 55 / 276 vs 16 / 148 , P = 0 . 017 ) . HCWs with infected family members tend to be 160 symptomatic cases ( OR , 2 . 053 [ 95 % CI , 1 . 130 - 3 . 730 ] ; P = 0 . 018 ) 161 Univariate and multivariable analyses 162 The comparison in high - risk procedures and infection protective measures between asymptomatic 163 HCWs and symptomatic HCWs are shown in Table 3 . No significant differences were seen in any 164 high - risk procedures between asymptomatic HCWs and symptomatic HCWs . Compared with 165 symptomatic HCWs , asymptomatic HCWs more consistently used hand washing , isolation gown , eye 166 protection , N95 respirators , gloves , and hair cover for protection ( P < 0 . 001 ) . 167 We also analyzed the factors associated with asymptomatic infection among HCWs by using logistic 168 regression model . The univariable logistic regression analysis showed worked in high - risk departments , 169 hand washing consistently and consistent use of isolation gown , N95 respirators , gloves , hair cover , 170 and eye protection were associated with an increased likelihood of asymptomatic infection ( Table S1 ) . 171 Although univariable analyses showed no significant association between tracheal intubation or 172 extubation and asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( OR , 2 . 363 [ 95 % CI , 0 . 780 - 7 . 156 ] ; P = 0 . 128 ) . In 173 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 multivariable analyses , tracheal intubation or extubation ( OR , 4 . 057 [ 95 % CI , 1 . 183 - 13 . 909 ] ; P = 0 . 026 ) 174 was associated with an increased likelihood of symptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Consistent use of 175 N95 respirators ( OR , 0 . 369 [ 95 % CI , 0 . 201 - 0 . 680 ] ; P = 0 . 001 ) and eye protection ( OR , 0 . 217 [ 95 % CI , 176 0 . 116 - 0 . 404 ] ; P < 0 . 001 ) were associated with decreased likelihood of symptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 177 infection ( Table 4 ) . 178 Discussion 179 Asymptomatic carriers of SARS - CoV - 2 have been reported in general population by several reports . 3 - 6 180 However , evidences about the differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals with 181 SARS - CoV - 2 infection were limited . Here , we described the incidence of asymptomatic infection of 182 SARS - CoV - 2 during the full screening in hospital setting . Tracheal intubation or extubation was found 183 to be associated with an increased likelihood of symptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection , while consistent 184 use of N95 respirators and eye protection tended to be asymptomatic infection . All these findings 185 suggested a potential relationship between initial infectious dose and disease severity . 186 The incidence of asymptomatic carriers in general population in China was announced by China’s 187 National Health Commission on April 1 , 2020 , that 130 ( 78 % ) of 166 positive cases were 188 asymptomatic . 17 Two studies reported the occurrence of asymptomatic infection in relatively confined 189 spaces including the Diamond Princess cruise ship and charter flights estimated the incidence to be 190 17 . 9 % and 30 . 8 % , respectively . 18 , 19 These relatively high incidences of asymptomatic cases in general 191 population put public on the alert for the presence of asymptomatic HCWs . With respect to this 192 concern , 1 270 HCWs were screened for SARS - CoV - 2 in a large UK teaching hospital , showing that 193 31 ( 2 . 4 % ) of HCWs tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 nucleic acid , comparable to 148 / 6473 ( 2 . 3 % ) in 194 our study . 20 Despite that our proportion from general HCW screening may be close to actual incidence 195 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 rate , this data should be interpreted by contextualizing it in specific hospital settings when taking 196 account in multi factors including the supplication of medical resources , SARS - CoV - 2 virulence and 197 the number of infected patients hospitalized . 198 The clinical spectrum of COVID - 19 can be very heterogeneous , ranging from asymptomatic infection 199 to respiratory failure . 2 The mechanisms affecting the interactions between the virus and the host 200 thereby determining such variable clinical manifestations have yet to be fully characterized . So far , 201 most research into understanding the wide clinical range of COVID - 19 has been focused on the host 202 immune status including age , comorbidities , circulating B and T cell responses . 21 - 24 However , in our 203 hospital setting , age and comorbidities weren ' t found to be associated with symptomatic infection . This 204 difference might be related to the fact that HCWs in our study comprised a young population ( median 205 age 35 years ) and a few underlying diseases . 206 Viral load of SARS - CoV - 2 was reported to be associated with severe clinical outcomes in patients with 207 COVID - 19 . 25 However , the role of other virologic properties including initial infectious dose , evolution 208 and virulence on clinical outcomes are still unknown . In 12 African green monkeys exposed to 209 different target doses of aerosolized MERS - CoV , a dose - dependent increase of respiratory disease 210 signs was observed . 26 In our study , we firstly showed that tracheal intubation or extubation were 211 associated an increased likelihood of symptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection . One possible explanation 212 could be that a relatively high initial virus exposure might lead a high viral load in respiratory tract , 213 thereby overcoming the barriers of the immune responses and causing symptomatic infection or even 214 unfavorable disease outcome . N95 respirators and eye protection have been reported to be associated 215 with a much lower risk of infection in a recent systematic review of 172 observational studies . 15 It has 216 been also reported that face coverings and mask were useful to filter out the majority of viral particles , 217 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 11 but not all . 27 , 28 Thus , some HCWs with the protection of eye protection and N95 respirators still got 218 infected but tended to be asymptomatic cases . This finding supported the hypothesis that universal 219 masking reduces the “inoculum” or dose of the virus for the mask - wearer , leading to more mild and 220 asymptomatic infection manifestations proposed by Gandhi et al . 16 All the factors associated with 221 asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 infection are tied to increased or decreased initial infectious dose . 222 Our study had several limitations . First , recall bias , especially in those HCWs with asymptomatic 223 infection , added to the complexity of the study and might affect the results in our study . Second , until 224 April 18 , 2020 , since not all HCWs in the two hospitals had tested SARS - CoV - 2 nucleic acid and 225 serological antibody , the number of actual asymptomatic HCWs in our study might be underestimated . 226 Nevertheless , most of the HCWs who had high - risk exposure history were subjected to SARS - CoV - 2 227 nucleic acid and serological antibody test . 228 In summary , this study reported a large number of asymptomatic HCWs with laboratory evidence of 229 SARS - CoV - 2 in Wuhan , China . Among HCWs with laboratory evidence of SARS - CoV - 2 , those who 230 have performed tracheal intubation or extubation were more likely to develop related symptoms , while 231 those taking aggressive measures including consistent use of N95 respirators , and eye protection tended 232 to be asymptomatic cases . These results suggest that the initial infectious dose of SARS - CoV - 2 plays 233 an important role in symptom severity of COVID - 19 . 234 235 Conflict of interest : Jin Y , Zhang S , Guo M , Wu F , Xiong N , Ma Y , Wang Z , Duan L , Chen L and 236 Ouyang H report no conflicts of interest . 237 Funding : This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China for 238 SARS - CoV - 2 ( no . 82041018 ) , the National Natural Science Foundation of China ( no . 81770096 and no . 239 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 12 81700091 ) , the Independent Innovation Research Fund for Huazhong University of Science and 240 Technology ( 2020kfyXGYJ ) , and the State Project for Essential Drug Research and Development , 241 China ( no . 2019ZX09301001 ) . 242 Acknowledgments : We thank all the HCWs fighting COVID - 19 in the front - line .
