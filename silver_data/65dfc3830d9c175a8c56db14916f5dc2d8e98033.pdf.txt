The distribution of Piezo1 within a cell is essential for various biological processes including cytokinesis , cell migration , and wound healing . However , the underlying principles that guide the subcellular distribution of Piezo1 remain largely unexplored . Here , we demonstrate that membrane curvature serves as a key regulator of the spatial distribution of Piezo1 in the plasma membrane of living cells . Piezo1 depletes from highly curved membrane protrusions such as filopodia and enriches to nanoscale membrane invaginations . Quantification of the curvature - dependent sorting of Piezo1 directly reveals the in situ nano - geometry of the Piezo1 - membrane complex . Piezo1 density on filopodia increases upon activation , independent of Ca 2 + , suggesting flattening of the channel upon opening . Consequently , the expression of Piezo1 inhibits filopodia formation , an effect that diminishes with channel activation . Introduction Piezo1 is a widely expressed mechanosensitive ion channel in the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells 1 , 2 , crucial for a broad range of mechanotransduction processes 3 - 5 . Each Piezo1 monomer contains 38 transmembrane helices and cryogenic electron microscopy ( CryoEM ) shows a trimeric propeller - like assembly which is thought to curve into the cytosol in its resting state 6 - 9 . Recently , a flattened configuration of Piezo1 was identified when reconstituted into small liposomes , potentially corresponding to the open / inactivated state of the ion channel 10 and confirming previous work using high speed atomic force microscopy ( HS - AFM ) 11 . The large size and curved architecture of Piezo1 trimers make them directly sensitive to tension in the plasma membrane 7 , 12 - 14 . Additionally , several studies indicate a cytoskeletal role in the activation of Piezo channels , while the presence of direct Piezo1 - cytoskeleton interaction is still under debate 15 - 22 . Notably , the cortical cytoskeleton can drastically affect the extent of membrane tension propagation , thereby indirectly controlling Piezo1 activation via the lipid bilayer 23 - 26 . 2 While the structure and activation of individual Piezo1 channels have been extensively studied , the dynamics and distribution of the channel within a cell are only starting to be explored 19 , 21 , 25 , 27 . In addition , it is unclear whether the Piezo1 structures determined in vitro recapitulate its nanoscale conformations in living cells 7 , 8 , 10 , 11 . Several recent studies highlighted a preferential subcellular distribution of Piezo1 : First , a polarized distribution of Piezo1 towards the rear of migrating keratinocytes plays a crucial role in controlling the speed of wound healing 28 . Additionally , Piezo1 has been found to enrich at subcellular structures that are important for mechanotransduction , such as focal adhesion sites 27 , 29 and T - tubules of cardiomyocytes 30 , 31 . Lastly , Piezo1 has been reported to preferentially localize to the intercellular bridge during cytokinesis 32 , and to the biconcave ‘dimples’ in red blood cells 19 , 21 . While a general mechanistic explanation has yet to be established , these intriguing subcellular patterns of Piezo1 raise the question of whether this ion channel can be sorted by fundamental physical factors on the cell surface . Several hints in the literature indicate that membrane curvature may play a role in regulating the cellular distribution of Piezo1 . First , the structure of purified Piezo1 trimers shows that they form nanoscale invaginations in a simple liposomal system 7 , 11 . When locally stretching membrane tethers to activate Piezo1 , Ca 2 + influx initiates around the tether - cell attachment point where membrane tension is high 23 . However , Ca 2 + initiation sites are noticeably missing from the highly tensed membrane tether itself 23 . More surprisingly , a recent study showed that force dependent Ca 2 + signals in filopodia are independent of Piezo channels 33 . Filopodia are highly curved membrane protrusions that geometrically resemble the artificially pulled membrane tethers ( tube of radius ~ 50 nm ) . Thus , a simple explanation would be that Piezo1 are actually absent from these highly curved membrane protrusions . Here , we combine high - throughput filopodia 34 and nanobar 35 , 36 sorting assays with quantitative single membrane tether pulling experiments 23 to show that membrane curvature is a fundamental regulator of Piezo1’s distribution within the plasma membrane . The curvature mismatch between Piezo1 and membrane protrusions prevents the channel from entering structures such as filopodia and thin membrane tethers . In contrast , Piezo1 significantly enriches to curved cell membrane invaginations induced by engineered nanobars 35 , 36 . Quantifying the curvature preference of Piezo1 on a wide range of tether radii reveals the nano - geometry of Piezo1 - membrane complex in living cells . Furthermore , a chemical activator of Piezo1 , Yoda1 , which has been hypothesized to serve as a molecular wedge to bias the protein towards a less - curved state 37 , allows Piezo1 to enter filopodia in a Ca 2 + - independent manner . The curvature - preference and Yoda1 - response of Piezo1 sorting in cells are consistent with recently determined structural features of purified Piezo1 trimers 10 . The coupling between curvature dependent sorting and activation of Piezo1 in living cells likely represents a fundamental cornerstone of Piezo1 channel biology , enabling the regulation of filopodia formation and retaining Piezo1 in the cell body during cell migration . Results Piezo1 is depleted from filopodia To study the distribution of Piezo1 in the plasma membrane , we first co - expressed human Piezo1 ( hPiezo1 - eGFP 12 ) and glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) anchored mCherry in HeLa cells . Piezo1 traffics well to the plasma membrane , as indicated by an eGFP fluorescence profile across the cell body that closely resembles the co - expressed plasma membrane marker ( Fig . 1A , Fig . 3 S1 ) . However , the Piezo1 signal was noticeably missing on filopodia that protrudes around the edge of the cell , in drastic contrast with membrane markers such as GPI and CaaX , and with other transmembrane proteins such as the dopamine receptor D2 ( D2R ) and the mechanosensitive potassium channel TREK1 ( Fig . 1A - 1C and Fig . S2 ) . To systematically quantify protein densities on filopodia , we defined a unitless filopodia sorting value ( S filo ) using the fluorescence ratio between the molecule of interest ( MOI ) and the membrane reference ( Fig . S3 , Methods ) . This fluorescence ratio measured along a filopodium is normalized to the same ratio on a flat region of the cell body to account for cell - cell variabilities . Additionally , the well - defined membrane geometry on a flat region of the cell allows us to directly quantify the diffraction - limited radii of filopodia from the fluorescence of membrane markers 23 .

All radii were determined from the GPI channel . Data labelled with ‘MEF’ were done in mouse embryonic fibroblasts with Piezo1 - tdTomato at endogenous expression level and ‘TREK1’ were measured in HEK293T cells due to TREK1’s poor expression in HeLa cells , all other quantifications were done in HeLa cells . In the box ( 25 % ~ 75 % ) plots , the mid - lines represent the median and the whiskers represent the 1 . 5 inter - quartile range ( same below ) . p values given by one - way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey’s test . * * * p < 10 - 7 . * * p < 10 - 3 . We found the S filo of Piezo1 is close to 0 , significantly smaller than the sorting of other MOIs ( S filo ~ 1 ; Fig . 1D ) . The lack of Piezo1 on filopodia is independent of imaging temperature , the choice of fluorescent protein ( FP ) tag , FP fusion position , or Piezo1 species ( Fig . 1D ) . In addition to HeLa cells , Piezo1 is depleted from the filopodia of HEK293T ( Fig . S4 ) and from the filopodia of mouse embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ) where tdTomato - labelled Piezo1 is expressed at endogenous levels ( Fig . S5 ) 25 , 28 . Referencing to the endogenous Piezo1 - tdTomato fluorescence in MEFs , the amount of overexpressed Piezo1 in HeLa cells is estimated to be 2 . 5 ± 1 . 5 ( mean ± SD , n = 12 ) fold ( Fig . S5C ) . Notably , D2R and TREK1 are significantly enriched on filopodia ( S filo > 1 ) . The filopodia enrichment of D2R agrees with established membrane curvature preference of GPCRs 34 , whereas the enrichment of TREK1 potentially reflects the protein’s role in filopodia formation 38 . Cells that overexpress Piezo1 had the same filopodia radii as cells expressing membrane markers ( Fig . 1E ) . In contrast , cells overexpressing D2R or TREK1 showed significantly reduced filopodia radii , consistent with the membrane deformation and curvature generation ability of many curvature sensing proteins 39 , 40 . However , the molecular mechanisms and the causalities between the increased S filo and the reduced filopodia radii in D2R or TREK1 expressing cells remain to be explored . The absence of Piezo1 on filopodia is consistent with the dispensability of Piezo1 for mechanically activated Ca 2 + signals in filopodia 33 . Additionally , the quantified curvature preference of Piezo1 ( S filo = 0 . 027 ± 0 . 003 , mean ± SEM ) is in accord with a recent CryoEM observation that only ~ 3 % of purified Piezo1 trimers were oriented ‘outside - out’ ( extracellular domains of Piezo1 facing the outside of liposomes ) , as a Piezo1 trimer on filopodia would be , when reconstituted into highly curved liposomes 10 . Depletion of Piezo1 is not specific to filopodia and is independent of cytoskeleton Cellular protrusions such as filopodia typically contain a complex network of actin - rich structures 41 . Is the observed depletion of Piezo1 in Fig . 1 specific to filopodia ? To answer this question , we focused our further investigation on membrane tethers that geometrically mimic filopodia but lack specific actin - based structures when freshly pulled 23 ( Fig . 2A ) . 5 Similar to the observation on filopodia , tethers pulled from HeLa cells or MEFs only contained signal for the membrane marker ( Fig . 2B , Fig . S5B ) , and no significant difference could be found between Piezo1’s sorting on tethers ( S teth ) and on filopodia ( S filo ) ( Fig . 2E ) . The geometrical similarity between tethers and filopodia ( both are highly curved membrane protrusions ) points to a possible role of membrane curvature in mediating the sorting of Piezo1 . However , S filo did not show any apparent dependence on filopodium radius , unlike that of D2R or TREK1 ( Fig . S6 ) . Additionally , S teth is independent of the relaxation of pulled tethers ( Fig . S7 ) . Notably , filopodia only present a small range of membrane radii ( 25 ~ 50 nm ) . Radii of short and fully relaxed tethers are similar to those of filopodia , while stretched tethers are typically thinner 23 ( Fig . 2F ) . Therefore , we hypothesize that the sorting of Piezo1 is most sensitive to membrane curvatures corresponding to > 50 nm radii protrusions . Alternatively , it is plausible that Piezo1 is strongly attached to the cortical cytoskeleton , preventing the channel from moving onto membrane protrusions . To test the two hypotheses , we generated stable membrane blebs via pharmacological depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton 23 . Similar to previous reports 12 , bleb membranes clearly contain Piezo1 signal , but not significantly enriched relative to the cell body ( Fig . 2C , 2D ; Fig . S8 ) . More importantly , negligible Piezo1 fluorescence was observed on membrane tethers pulled from tense blebs ( Fig . 2C ) . Plasma membrane blebs do not contain cytoskeleton , therefore results such as Fig . 2C directly argue against a main cytoskeletal role in the depletion of Piezo1 from tethers . The radius of a tether pulled from the bleb is determined by the bleb’s membrane tension 23 , which is in turn governed by the intracellular pressure 42 . We found that membrane blebs triggered by actin depolymerization exhibited a wide range of apparent ‘floppiness’ , likely a result of stochastic pressure release during bleb formation . On floppy ( i . e . , low membrane tension ) blebs , pulled tethers showed much wider apparent radii ( Fig . 2D ; eq . S6 ) . Importantly , Piezo1 fluorescence can be clearly observed on these wide tethers , leading to a highly scattered S teth of Piezo1 on tethers pulled from blebs ( Fig . 2E ) . Tethers are typically imaged > 1 min after pulling , whereas membrane tension equilibrates within 1 s across cellular scale free membranes ( e . g . , bleb , tether ) 23 . Therefore , the sorting of Piezo1 within individual tension - equilibrated tether - bleb systems ( Fig . 2C – 2G ) suggests that membrane curvature can directly modulate Piezo1 distribution beyond potential confounding tension effects . When combining the Piezo1 sorting and the tether radius measurements together , a clear positive correlation can be observed , with S teth on tense blebs comparable to S teth measured on intact cells and to the fraction of ‘outside - out’ Piezo1 trimers when reconstituted into small liposomes 10 ( Fig . 2G ) . S teth of Piezo1 is independent of bleb radius ( Fig . 2G , inset ) , confirming the lack of optical artifacts induced by bleb curvature . However , the curved geometry of blebs only allowed determination of an apparent tether radius ( Fig . S3 ) . We assumed that the average radius of filopodia and equilibrated tethers from cell body are equal to the radii of tethers from the tensest blebs , thus converting the apparent radii ( in A . U . ) to absolute radii ( in nm ) of tethers from blebs ( Fig . 2F , 2G ) . The conversion was consistent with the upper bound of tether diameters set by the width of optically resolvable catenoid - shape membranes at the two ends of low - tension tethers 43 ( Fig . S8C ) . 6 Figure 2 . Sorting of Piezo1 on membrane tethers . ( A ) Fluorescence images of a HeLa cell co - expressing hPiezo1 - eGFP ( left ) and GPI - mCherry ( middle ) .

Quantification of Piezo1’s molecular features The trimer of Piezo1 has been suggested to adopt an ‘outside - in’ dome shape in liposomal systems 7 , 10 , 11 , 44 . If this were to occur in cells , Piezo1 would energetically prefer certain membrane invaginations ( positive curvature ) and stay away from membrane protrusions ( negative curvature ) such as the filopodium and tether . Accordingly , we fitted our measured relation between the sorting of Piezo1 on tether ( S t ) and the tether radius ( R t ) in Fig . 2G to a 2 - parameter model based on the bending energy of membrane protrusions ( Method ) 34 , 45 : 𝑆 t = exp [ −𝐴 P ̃ ( 1 𝑅 t2 + 2𝐶 0 𝑅 t ) ] ( 1 ) Here 𝐴 P ̃ = 𝜅̃𝐴 P 2k B 𝑇 is the product of the unit area for each Piezo1 - membrane complex ( A p ) and its bending stiffness ( 𝜅̃ ) , normalized by the Boltzmann constant ( k B ) and the absolute temperature ( T ) . A p represents the area of a potentially curved surface and should not be confused with the projected area of the protein . C 0 , expected to be positive for Piezo1 , is the spontaneous curvature of each protein - membrane complex in the ( mostly flat ) plasma membrane and would be lower than the apparent curvature of Piezo1 in detergents or in highly curved liposomes 10 , 11 , 44 . The two fitting parameters 𝐴 𝑃 ̃ and C 0 correspond to the contributions of Piezo1’s size ( larger proteins have a stronger tendency to stay away from highly curved membranes ) and intrinsic curvature , respectively . The fitting gave 𝐴 𝑃 ̃ = 2400 ± 1000 nm 2 and C 0 - 1 = 83 ± 17 nm . The spontaneous curvature of the Piezo1 - membrane complex C 0 represents a balance between the intrinsic curvature of Piezo1 trimers ( 0 . 04 ~ 0 . 2 nm - 1 as suggested by CryoEM studies 10 , 11 , 44 ) and that of the associated membrane ( 0 nm - 1 , assuming lipid bilayers alone do not have an intrinsic curvature and the formation of tether is only due to the external pulling force ) , consistent with the large amount of lipids associated with the dome of the propeller - shaped Piezo1 trimers 7 , 10 . Combining tether pulling force and tether radius measurements 23 , the resulted membrane bending stiffness of Piezo1 - expressing HeLa cells was 13 . 6 ± 3 . 8 k B T ( n = 9 ) , comparable to that of HeLa cell blebs : 12 . 7 ± 2 . 5 k B T ( n = 14 ; Fig . S9 ) . The similarity between the bending stiffnesses of cell and bleb membranes suggest minimal compositional change during bleb formation 46 . Using the bending stiffness of bleb membranes , we estimated the area of each Piezo1 unit A P = 380 ± 170 nm 2 , in agreement with the area of Piezo1 trimers measured with CryoEM ( ~ 400 nm 2 ) 10 , 11 , 14 , 44 . Enrichment of Piezo1 on membrane invaginations While the previous measurements focus on the behavior of Piezo1 on membrane protrusions , the model can be directly extended to estimate the sorting of Piezo1 on membrane invaginations . It is worth noting that contributions from the size and the spontaneous curvature of Piezo1 are synergistic in the case of protrusions ( eq . S14 ) but can cancel each other out on invaginations 8 ( eq . S15 ) . Therefore , the enrichment of Piezo1 onto invaginations is predicted to be much less prominent than the depletion of Piezo1 from protrusions , with the sorting of Piezo1 peaking at 1 . 41 when the radius of invagination is 83 nm ( Fig . S10 , Methods ) . Moreover , the enrichment of Piezo1 is predicted to be only ( 7 ± 35 ) % on 25 ~ 75 nm invaginations compared to an ( 87 ± 10 ) % depletion effect on protrusions of the same range of radii . This is consistent with the lack of obvious Piezo1 enrichment spots in the bulk of the plasma membrane where highly curved ( < 50 nm radius ) invaginations such as endocytic sites and caveolae are expected ( Fig . S1 - S5 ) . Figure 3 . Enrichment of Piezo1 towards the ends of nanobars . ( A ) Illustration of a nanobar .

All scale bars are 2 µm . To explore potential enrichment of Piezo1 on membrane invaginations , we grew hPiezo1 - expressing cells on substrates that have been finely engineered with nanobars 35 , 36 . Each nanobar presents two curved ends and a flat central region ( Fig . 3A ) and can be duplicated with high precision ( Fig . 3B ) . When cells are cultured on top of nanobar - patterned substrates , their basal membranes will adapt to the geometry of the substrate and form membrane invaginations in parallel 36 . In hPiezo1 - eGFP expressing cells , Piezo1 tends to enrich towards the curved ends , whereas the membrane marker ( CellMask Deep Red ) homogeneously distributes across the entire nanobar ( Fig . 3C ) . By averaging over hundreds of nanobars with 3 different diffraction - limited widths ( 200 , 300 , 400 nm ) , we observed clear enrichments of Piezo1 towards the curved ends as compared to the flat central regions of nanobars ( Fig . 3D , 3E ) . For all three nanobar widths , the end - to - center ratios for Piezo1 are significantly higher than those for the membrane marker ( Fig . 3E , 3F ) . The median of Piezo1’s enrichment at the curved ends ( relative to the membrane marker ) ranges from 1 . 31 to 1 . 49 , comparable to the predicted sorting of Piezo1 in this range of membrane curvature ( Fig . S10 ; S = 1 . 26 ~ 1 . 40 for invagination radius of 100 ~ 200 nm ) and to established sensors for membrane invaginations 47 . The sorting of Piezo1 was not significantly different between the three nanobar widths ( Fig . 3F ) , consistent with the predicted low curvature sensitivity on 100 ~ 200 nm invaginations ( | d S / d R | < 2 µm - 1 , which is more than 4 - fold lower than | d S / d R | around 55 nm protrusions ; Fig . S10 ) . While further investigations on a wider range of membrane curvature are required to fully map out the sorting of Piezo1 on membrane invaginations , our data ( Fig . 3 ) clearly suggest that membrane curvature can lead to enrichment of Piezo1 on cellular invaginations . Yoda1 leads to a Ca 2 + independent increase of Piezo1 on tethers Yoda1 is a Piezo1 agonist that has been hypothesized to bias the channel towards a less - curved state 37 . Equation ( 1 ) predicts that a smaller C 0 would lead to an increase of Piezo1 density on protrusions ( Fig . S10 ) . Indeed , a significantly increased amount of Piezo1 signal was observed on filopodia after adding 10 µ M of Yoda1 , while the radii of these filopodia remain unaltered ( Fig . 4A - C , S11A ) . Additionally , the S filo of activated Piezo1 showed a positive correlation with filopodia radii ( Fig . 3D ; Pearson’s r = 0 . 59 ) . Assuming the size of Piezo1 doesn’t change during activation ( 𝐴 𝑃 ̃ = 2400 nm 2 ) , our model predicts a spontaneous curvature C 0 - 1 = ( 4 ± 13 ) µm of the Piezo1 - membrane complex in the presence of Yoda1 , corresponding to an essentially flat geometry ( Fig . 4D , S10 ) . The Yoda1 effect on Piezo1 sorting was not instantaneous , taking more than 5 min to equilibrate ( Fig . S12A ) . This is consistent with the measured mean diffusion coefficient of Piezo1 on the cell membrane ( Fig . S12B ; 0 . 0021± 0 . 0004 µ m 2 / s , n = 44 ) , indicating that Piezo1 trimers diffuse from the cell body to filopodia after Yoda1 - induced activation . 10 11 Figure 4 .

( H ) Illustration showing the membrane curvature sorting of Piezo1 ( orange - green ) relative to GPI ( red ) and the effect of Yoda1 ( magenta circle ) and pre - stressing ( black arrows ) on the curvature sorting of Piezo1 . Under regular cell culture conditions , we noticed that only a small portion of filopodia ( ~ 10 % ) showed measurably changed Piezo1 signal in response to the Yoda1 treatment ( Fig . 4E ) . We reasoned that the opening of Piezo1 resembles a sharp two - state transition 14 , and the main effect of Yoda1 is to lower the transition tension 37 . Piezo1 cannot be opened by Yoda1 if the resting tension of the cell is too low , whereas channels that are in a pre - stressed ( yet closed ) state would have a higher chance to respond to Yoda1 . To test this , we pre - stressed the cells with hypotonic shock . The hypotonic shock itself did not significantly change the fraction of filopodia that showed significant sorting of Piezo1 . However , significantly more ( ~ 35 % ) filopodia responded to a subsequent Yoda1 treatment ( Fig . 4E , 4F , S11B , S12C ) . Importantly , Yoda1 - induced S filo of Piezo1 is not a result of Ca 2 + influx , as a similar effect can be observed on cells maintained in a Ca 2 + - free buffer ( Fig . 4E , 4G ) . Additionally , Yoda1 induced sorting of Piezo1 is reversible as Piezo1 signals disappear from filopodia after washing out Yoda1 ( Fig . 4E - G ) . Importantly , shear stress applied during washing steps alone did not significantly change the sorting of Piezo1 on filopodia ( Fig . S12D ) . On individual filopodium , the apparent all - or - none response to Yoda1 treatment suggests that cooperativity between Yoda1 - Piezo1 or Piezo1 - Piezo1 may also play a role in modulating the channel’s curvature sorting behavior . The flattening of Piezo1 during activation has been suggested using HS - AFM 11 , in silico 48 , 49 , and has recently partially been confirmed using CryoEM 10 . Our study suggests this conformational change of Piezo1 may also happen in live cells ( Fig . 4H ) . Piezo1 inhibits filopodia formation Curvature sensing proteins often have a modulating effect on membrane geometry . For example , N - BAR proteins , which strongly enrich to positive membrane curvature , can mechanically promote endocytosis by making it easier to form membrane invaginations 40 , 50 . Thus , we hypothesize that Piezo1 , which strongly depletes from negative membrane curvature ( Fig . 1 , Fig . 2 ) , can have an inhibitory effect on the formation of membrane protrusions such as filopodia . 12 Figure 5 .

All fluorescence images here are shown in log - scale to highlight the filopodia . All scale bars are 10 µm . p values given by two - tailed Student’s t test after checking for normality . * * * p < 10 - 7 , * * p < 10 - 3 . Indeed , HeLa cells with higher expression level of hPiezo1 - eGFP tend to have less filopodia ( Fig . 5A , 5B ) . However , due to the low expression of hPiezo1 - eGFP in the majority of HeLa cells , only a weak negative correlation was observed between filopodia number and hPiezo1 - eGFP fluorescence in each cell ( Fig . 5B ) . In HEK293T cells where hPiezo1 - eGFP expresses 3 . 5 - fold higher , a stronger negative correlation was observed between the number of filopodia per cell and hPiezo1 - eGFP density on the cell membrane ( Fig . 5C , 5D ) . Interestingly , the negative correlation almost completely diminished when HEK293T cells were cultured in 5 µM Yoda1 ( Fig . 5D ) , consistent with Yoda1’s ability to reduce the curvature effects of Piezo1 ( Fig . 4 ) . In Piezo1 knockout ( Piezo1 - KO ) cells , adding Yoda1 to the culture medium does not significantly change the number of filopodia ( Fig . 5E ) , suggesting the agonist does not directly regulate filopodia formation without acting on Piezo1 . Next , we quantified the mechanical effect of Piezo1 by measuring the force needed to maintain 5 ~ 10 µm tethers from HEK293T cells ( Fig . 5F , 5G ) . The equilibrium tether pulling force from cells overexpressing hPiezo1 was 58 ± 18 pN ( mean ± SD , n = 5 ) , significantly higher than cells without hPiezo1 overexpression ( 36 ± 6 pN ; mean ± SD , n = 5 ; Fig . 5H ) . Overexpressed Piezo1 in HEK293T cells ( Fig . 5D – 5H ) is ~ 3 . 5 - fold higher than in HeLa cells ( Fig . 5A – 5B ) , thus ~ 10 - fold of the endogenous level ( Fig . S5C ) . While this high Piezo1 level may resemble the local density of Piezo1 at specific cellular regions such as focal adhesion sites 27 , we wonder whether the observed mechanical effect on membrane protrusions can be of general physiological relevance . To answer this question , we compared the number of filopodia on MEFs dissected from wild type ( WT ) or Piezo1 heterozygous ( Het . ) mice with those from their Piezo1 - KO littermates ( Fig . 5I ) 25 , 28 . Both WT ( Fig . 5J ) and Het . ( Fig . 5K ) MEFs showed significantly less filopodia compared to their Piezo1 - KO counterparts , suggesting that endogenous level Piezo1 can already inhibit filopodia formation . Discussion The curved structure of Piezo1 trimer has been suggested to play an important role in the activation of the channel 7 , 10 , 11 , 14 . Our study demonstrates that the coupling of Piezo1 to nanoscale membrane curvature also regulates the distribution of Piezo1 within the plasma membrane . The observations of Piezo1 depletion from membrane protrusion ( Fig . 1 , Fig . 2 ) and enrichment to membrane invaginations ( Fig . 3 ) are consistent with a recent report of Piezo1 distribution in red blood cells 19 . Our experiments also strongly support the hypothesis that Piezo1 flattens during activation 7 , 10 , 11 , 37 , thereby coupling the activation of the channel to its subcellular distribution . It is worth noting that our data and model do not assume any molecular detail of Piezo1 and are 14 limited by optical resolution ( ~ 500 nm ) . However , the revealed nano - geometries of the channel are on the order of 10 nm and are in surprising agreement with the structural information of purified Piezo1 trimers 7 , 8 , 10 , 11 . Membrane curvature sensing has been studied for a range of proteins including BAR domain proteins and GPCRs 34 , 40 , 45 , 51 , our report extends such quantitative studies to a mechanosensitive ion channel . Our parsimonious model predicts that the large area of the Piezo1 - membrane complex ( more than 10 - fold larger than a typical GPCR ) leads to prominent size effects that has often been neglected when studying smaller membrane proteins ( Fig . S10 ) : 1 ) sorting of Piezo1 is exquisitely sensitive to the flattening of the channel ( C 0 from 83 - 1 nm - 1 to 0 nm - 1 ) . On 50 nm protrusions , the model predicts a ~ 200 % increase in sorting when Piezo1 flattens . This effect diminishes to ~ 10 % if Piezo1 were 10 times smaller ; 2 ) Piezo1 would deplete from highly curved invaginations ( S < 1 when R i < 41 nm ) due to the large energy cost to match the spontaneous curvature of Piezo1 with the shape of the invaginations . The second prediction may be verified by systematically studying Piezo1 density on highly curved membrane invaginations . However , it is worth noting that we assumed a zero spontaneous curvature for membranes associated with Piezo1 and that the spontaneous curvature of the Piezo1 - membrane complex is independent of the shape of surrounding membranes . These assumptions may no longer hold when studying Piezo1 in highly curved invaginations or liposomes 11 . Furthermore , our model assumes that Piezo1 behaves as 2 - dimensional ideal gas in the membrane . While the assumption is consistent with the observation that Piezo1 trimers function independently 52 , we did neglect potentially important intermolecular interactions between Piezo1 trimers 25 , 28 , 49 , 53 . Notably , apparent clusters of Piezo1 were often observed on cell membranes ( Fig . 1 , Fig . S1 - S5 ) and on membrane tethers ( Fig . 2D ) , suggesting that attractions between Piezo1 trimers may also be important for controlling the detailed distribution of the channel in cells . Lastly , Piezo1 - membrane complexes likely have isotropic curvatures ( such as a spherical dome 7 ) , whereas the membrane protrusions and invaginations in our study are anisotropically curved , with one principal membrane curvature close to zero . Improved models that consider the effect of curvature anisotropy may provide additional insights to the curvature sensing of Piezo1 54 , 55 . In addition to membrane curvature , tension in the membrane may also affect the subcellular distribution of Piezo1 21 . Particularly , membrane tension can activate the channel and potentially change Piezo1’s nano - geometries . This tension effect is unlikely to play a significant role in our interpretation of the curvature sorting of Piezo1 ( Fig . 2 ) : ( 1 ) HeLa cell membrane tension as probed by short tethers ( Fig . S9F ; 45 ± 29 pN / µm on blebs and 270 ± 29 pN / µm on cells , with the highest recorded tension at 426 pN / µm ) are significantly lower than the activation tension for Piezo1 ( > 1000 pN / µm 12 , 13 , 23 , 56 ) . ( 2 ) With more activated ( and potentially flat ) channels under high membrane tension , one would expect a higher density of Piezo1 on tethers pulled from tenser blebs . This is the opposite to our observations in Fig . 2C - 2G , where Piezo1 density on tethers was found to decrease with the absolute curvature , thus tension ( eq . S6 ) , of membrane tethers . A Yoda1 - induced flattening of Piezo1 has not been directly observed via CryoEM . Our results ( Fig . 4 ) point towards two challenges in determining this potential structural change : ( 1 ) Yoda1 induced changes in Piezo1 sorting is greatly amplified after pre - stretching the membrane ( Fig . 4E ) , pointing to the possibility that a significant tension in the membrane is required for the flattening of Yoda1 - bound Piezo1 . ( 2 ) Piezo1 is often incorporated in small ( < 20 nm radius ) liposomes for CryoEM studies . The shape of liposomes can confine the nano - geometry of Piezo1 10 , 11 , rendering it significantly more challenging to respond to potential Yoda1 effects . This 15 potential influence of membrane curvature on the activation of Piezo1 would be an interesting direction for future studies . The antagonistic effect of Piezo1 on the formation of filopodia is consistent with several recent observations : First , Piezo can modulate the morphogenesis and targeting of dendrites independently of its activity as a mechanosensitive ion channel 57 . Secondly , knocking out Piezo in Drosophila promotes axon regeneration 58 . Furthermore , Piezo1 negatively regulates the morphological activity ( i . e . , number of protrusions ) of muscle stem cells 59 . Lastly , Piezo2 inhibits neurite outgrowth in N2A cells 17 . In addition to membrane curvature , several parallel Piezo - related mechanisms can regulate the formation and growth of filopodia , including Ca 2 + signaling induced by the activation of Piezo and potential interactions between specific Piezo domains with cytoskeletal components 17 , 58 , 59 . Our data do not exclude these parallel mechanisms , rather , we suggest that the curvature preference of Piezo1 provides an additional route to control filopodia dynamics . Further studies are required to fully dissect the contribution of each of these variables . In addition to regulating the formation of filopodia ( Fig . 4 ) , the curvature sensing of Piezo1 can have a direct benefit of making sure that the protein is retained at the rear edge during cell migration and to avoid losing Piezo1 to retraction fibers ( e . g . , Fig . S4B ) 28 . Moreover , the dynamics of filopodia are often linked to the metastatic transition of cancer cells 41 , suggesting new roles of Piezo1 in cancer biology 29 . Overall , our study suggests that the curvature sensing of Piezo1 provides nanoscale input for the channel in live cells and is a universal regulator of the channel’s distribution within cell membranes . These features are likely to be of fundamental importance to a wide range of Piezo1 - dependent biological processes . Methods Cell harvesting and culture , transfection , bleb formation , osmotic shock , and Yoda1 treatment HeLa cells ( ATCC and from Renping Zhou lab , Rutgers ) were cultured in Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium ( EMEM ) supplemented with 10 % Fetal Bovine Serum ( FBS ) and 1 % Penicillin / Streptomycin ( PS ) . HEK293T cells ( from Zhiping Pang lab , Rutgers ) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % FBS , 1 % PS and 1 % Sodium Pyruvate . Both cell lines were seeded in 100 mm plastic dishes with ~ 1 × 10 6 cells per dish . Cells were kept in incubator with 5 % CO 2 and 100 % relative humidity at 37°C . All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of University of California at Irvine and performed in accordance with their guidelines . To obtain Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts ( MEFs ) , mice that are heterozygous for Piezo1 knockout ( Piezo1 ∆ / + ) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories ( JAX stock 026948 ) and were bred with C57BL6 / J to maintain the colony . Piezo1 ∆ / + mice were bred with each other to generate a mixture of wild type ( WT ) , heterozygous ( Het . ) , and knockout ( Piezo1 - KO ) embryos . Mice were considered embryonic day 0 . 5 upon vaginal plugging . Embryos were genotyped via a commercial vendor ( Transnetyx ) . MEFs with endogenously labelled Piezo1 were harvested from Piezo1 - tdTomato reporter mice ( Mus . musculus , JAX stock 029214 ) , expressing Piezo1 with a tdTomato knock - in at the C - terminus ( gift from Patapoutian lab ) 60 . 16 Embryos were dissected by separating the head , limbs , and tail from the embryo at embryonic days 10 . 5 ( WT , Het , Piezo1 - KO ) or 12 . 5 ( Piezo1 - tdTomato ) in Dulbecco ' s PBS ( Gibco ) supplemented with 33 mM D - ( + ) - glucose ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and 1 % Penicillin - Streptomycin ( 10 , 000 U / mL ; Gibco ) . Following dissection , tissue was spun down at ~ 260G for 5 min , and the supernatant was aspirated . The remaining tissue from each embryo was gently triturated in DMEM ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) with 15 % FBS ( Omega Scientific ) , 1x GlutaMax ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) , 1 mM sodium pyruvate ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) , and 1x non - essential amino acid solution ( ThermoFisher Scientific ) in a sterile environment to obtain single cells . All MEFs were grown in a 5 % CO 2 incubator at 37 ºC , and media was changed 24 hours after plating . Cells from individual embryos obtained from the Het . crosses were cultured separately in 12 - well plates ( USA Scientific ) coated with 0 . 1 % gelatin solution ( Fisher Scientific ) until genotypes were determined . Subsequently , cells were pooled together by genotype and cultured . Cells were grown until 90 % confluency was reached . All MEFs were passaged using TrypLE Express ( ThermoFisher ) to dissociate the cells and were spun at ~ 260G for 5 min . Cells were passaged at least three times prior to use in experiments . For fluorescence imaging , cells were transfected in 35 mm plastic dishes at around 60 % confluency . For HeLa cells , a mixture of 125 µL Opti - MEM , 3 . 5 µL TransIT - X2 and 300 ng of each plasmid DNA were added after 12 min incubation . For MEFs and HEK293T cells , a mixture of 250 µL Opti - MEM , 5 µL P3000 reagent , 3 . 5 µL Lipofectamine reagent and 500 ng of each plasmid DNA were added after 15 min incubation . Cells were kept in an incubator for 24 hours before further split onto 35 mm precoated ( Poly - D - Lysine for HeLa cells and Matrigel for MEFs and HEK293T cells ) glass bottom dishes ( Cellvis ) for imaging . Cells were imaged 12 - 48 hours after splitting . Before imaging , cell culture medium was replaced with extracellular imaging buffer ( XC buffer ) containing 125 mM NaCl , 2 . 5 mM KCl , 15 mM HEPES , 30 mM Glucose , 1 mM MgCl 2 and 3 mM CaCl 2 with pH 7 . 3 . Ca 2 + free experiments were done by omitting CaCl 2 in the XC buffer . Hypotonic osmotic shock was carried out by using a diluted XC buffer that is 0 . 25 ~ 0 . 5 of its initial concentration . To trigger blebs , HeLa cells were incubated with 400 µL of 100 ~ 200 µM Latrunculin B ( diluted in XC buffer ) for 5 min . Additional XC buffer was added after bleb formation to keep a final Latrunculin concentation of 20 ~ 40 µM during experiments . For experiments in Fig . 5 , stock solution of Yoda1 ( 5 mM , dissolved in DMSO ) was diluted to 5 µM in EMEM before use . Cells were incubated with 5 μM Yoda1 solution for 2 to 4 hours . Control group was incubated with 0 . 1 % DMSO for the same amount of time . After incubation , culture media were carefully replaced with XC buffer containing the same concentrations of Yoda1 or DMSO . For experiments in Fig . 4 , stock solution of Yoda1 was diluted to 10 µM in XC buffer before use . The number of filopodia per cell in Fig . 5 was counted manually for all protrusions that are longer than 1 μm for HEK293T cells and longer than 2 μm for MEFs and HeLa cells , counting was independently verified by two researchers and by FiloDetect 61 . Imaging , tether pulling , and quantification Fluorescence imaging was done on either a Leica DMi8 or a Nikon Ti2 - A inverted microscope . Leica DMi8 was equipped with an oil - immersion objective ( 100X ; NA 1 . 47 ; Leica ) and laser excitation ( 488 nm for eGFP and 561 nm for mCherry , tdTomato , or mOrange2 ) , and allows total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) imaging . Nikon Ti2 - A microscope was equipped with LED 17 excitation ( ~ 470 nm for eGFP and ~ 550 nm for mCherry , tdTomato , or mOrange2 ) and with either a water - immersion objective ( 60X ; NA 1 . 20 ; Nikon ) or an oil - immersion objective ( 100X ; NA 1 . 30 ; Nikon ) . The oil immersion objective was integrated with an objective heater ( OKO lab ) for 37 o C measurements . Temperature was calibrated by directly measuring the temperature of the medium near the imaged cell . The Leica DMi8 was integrated with an Infinity Scanner ( Leica ) for fluorescent recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) experiments . The Nikon Ti2 - A microscope was integrated with two micromanipulators ( PatchPro - 5000 , Scientifica ) and an optical tweezer ( Tweez305 , Aresis ) for tether pulling and force measurements . Images were analyzed with ImageJ and Matlab ( R2019a ) . Membrane tethers were pulled from the cell body or cell - attached membrane blebs using either a motorized micropipette 62 with a fused tip or a polystyrene bead ( 4 . 5 μm ) trapped with an optical tweezer . Membrane curvature sorting and filopodia / tether radii were calculated according to the illustration in Fig . S3 . We hypothesize that filopodia and membrane tether are cylindrical membrane tubes , and that the quantum yields of fluorescent proteins are independent of local curvature . For radius calculation , we also assume that both bilayers of a flat region of the cell are captured in widefield epi - fluorescence images 23 . For membrane tube with a diffraction - limited radius r , if a region of interest ( ROI ) is drawn to cover a length L of the tube ( Fig . S3B ) , the total membrane area with the ROI is given by 𝐴 tube = 2𝜋𝑟𝐿 ( eq . S1 ) Assume 𝐼 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛𝑡𝑢𝑏𝑒 is the background - corrected mean fluorescence within the ROI on the tube , 𝐴 𝑅𝑂𝐼 is the area of the ROI , the total fluorescence should equal to the number density of FPs on membrane ( ρ ) multiplied by 𝐴 𝑡𝑢𝑏𝑒 and by the fluorescence per FP ( β ) . 𝐼 meantube ∙ 𝐴 ROI = 𝐴 tube ∙ 𝜌 ∙ 𝛽 ( eq . S2 ) The background - corrected mean fluorescence within the ROI on a flat region of the cell membrane ( Fig . S3B ) , 𝐼 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙 , is related to ρ and β by 𝐼 meancell = 𝑀 ∙ 𝜌 ∙ 𝛽 ( eq . S3 ) The factor M takes into account the number of cell membrane surfaces within the imaging depth . Combining equations S1 to S3 , the radius of the membrane tube is given by 𝑟 = 𝑀 ∙ 𝐼 meantube ∙ 𝐴 ROI 2𝜋𝐿 ∙ 𝐼 meancell ( eq . S4 ) When imaging a flat region of the cell under widefield fluorescence microscopy , we use M = 2 ( Fig . S3D ) . HEK293T cells often do not contain a flat region on the cell body ( Fig . S2E , Fig . S4 ) . To address this issue , we use TIRF microscopy and set M = 1 when measuring filopodia radii from HEK293T cells . In principle , r can be calculated using the fluorescence of any membrane proteins / lipids , however , only molecules in the membrane that do not have membrane curvature sensitivity can give the real tube radius . The reported tether and filopodia radii in our study were determined using the fluorescence of GPI - FP . GPI anchors the FP to the outer leaflet of the plasma 18 membrane . Due to the relatively large size of FP to the GPI anchor , GPI - FPs may have enrichment towards highly curved protrusions 63 . For the same reason , CaaX - FP , which is anchored to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane may deplete from membrane protrusions . However , we expect this effect to be less than 7 % , as the relative sorting of CaaX to GPI was measured to be 0 . 863 ± 0 . 008 ( Fig . 1D ) . When a tether is pulled from a bleb ( Fig . 3C and 3D ) , an apparent radius of the tether was calculated using the background - corrected mean fluorescence within the ROI of the bleb membrane instead of 𝐼 meancell ( Fig . S3C ) . Membrane curvature sorting ( S ) on a protrusion is the effective number density of a molecule of interest ( MOI ) on the membrane tube relative to either a flat region on the cell body ( Fig . S3B ) or the membrane bleb ( Fig . S3C ) . 𝑆 = 𝑟 ( MOI ) 𝑟 ( GPI ) ( eq . S5 ) S = 0 when the MOI is completely depleted from the tube . S = 1 when the MOI has the same curvature preference as the GPI - FP reference . An ROI width of 0 . 5 μm was used for all tether / filopodium quantifications . Filopodia that are sufficiently away ( > 1 μm ) from other membrane structures and more than 3 μm in length were picked for calculating S and r . Errors in S and r were propagated using the standard deviation in the background fluorescence as the error for mean fluorescent intensities . In Fig . 4E , filopodia with clear Piezo1 signal on less than 10 % of the total length ( typically corresponding to S < 0 . 1 ) were considered as no response ; between 10 % to 50 % of the filopodia ( typically corresponding to 0 . 1 < S < 0 . 3 ) were considered weak response ; more than 50 % of the filopodia ( S > 0 . 3 ) were considered strong response . Fabrication , cell culture , imaging , analysis with nanobar - substrates Nanobar substrates were fabricated on the surface of a square quartz coverslip with electron - beam lithography ( EBL ) 35 , 36 . Briefly , the quartz chip was firstly spin - coated with the poly ( methyl methacrylate ) ( PMMA ) ( MicroChem ) with around 300 nm height , followed by one layer of conductive polymer AR - PC 5090 . 02 ( Allresist ) . Nanobar patterns were written by Electron Beam Lithography ( FEI Helios NanoLab ) , and then developed in isopropanol : methylisobutylketone solution with 3 : 1 ratio . After that , a 30 nm thickness chromium ( Cr ) mask was deposited by thermal evaporation ( UNIVEX 250 Benchtop ) and then lifted off with acetone . Nanobars were then generated through reactive ion etching ( RIE ) with a mixture of CHF3 and CF4 ( Oxford Plasmalab ) . Nanobar dimensions were identified by scanning Electron Microscopy ( FEI Helios NanoLab ) imaging with 10 nm Cr coating . To enable cell imaging on nanochip , the chip was attached to the 35 mm cell culture dish ( TPP ) with a hole punched in the center to expose nanobar pattern . Before cell plating , the dish substrate was sterilized by UV treatment for 20 minutes and treated with high - power air plasma ( Harrick Plasma ) for 3 minutes . The surface was coated with 0 . 2 % Gelatin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) for 30 minutes to promote cell attachment . Homosapiens bone osteosarcoma U2OS cells ( ATCC ) maintained in DMEM with GlutaMAX ( Gibco ) supplemented medium with 10 % FBS ( Life Technologies ) and 1 % Penicillin - Streptomycin ( PS ) ( Life Technologies ) were then cultured on the nanobar chip one day before transfection . The cells were maintained in a standard incubator under 37 o C and 5 % CO 2 . 19 Cells were transfected with hPiezo1 - eGFP plasmid via Lipofectamine . Membrane staining with CellMask Deep Red ( Life Technologies ) was performed before imaging . The 1000 - time diluted dye was added to the cells and incubated for 1 minutes at 37 o C and washed with DMEM . Cell imaging was performed with a spinning disc confocal ( SDC ) built around a Nikon Ti2 inverted microscope containing a Yokogawa CSU - W1 confocal spinning head and a 100 X / 1 . 4NA oil immersion objective . eGFP was excited at 488 nm and detected at 505 - 545 nm . CellMask Deep Red was excited at 639 nm and detected at 672 - 712 nm . During imaging , the cells were maintained under 37 o C with 5 % CO 2 in an on - stage incubator . The Piezo1 - eGFP curvature sensing preference on gradient nanobars with different widths was quantified using Matlab 35 , 36 . In brief , the background signals of each image were firstly subtracted by the rolling ball algorithm in ImageJ ( radius = 0 . 77 µm ) . Next , the nanobars covered by cell membrane were identified by square masks ( 3 . 92 µm × 3 . 92 µm ) centered at the nanobar . The average images were generated by averaging all the individual nanobar masks . To quantify the end - to center ratio , each nanobar was segmented into three ROIs ( two nanobar - ends and a nanobar - center ; Fig . 3D ) . End - to - center ratios were calculated by dividing the mean end - intensity with the mean center - intensity . The curvature sorting of Piezo1 on membrane invaginations is evaluated by dividing the end - to - center ratio in the Piezo1 channel by that of the CellMask channel . Tether force measurement To measure tether force , a membrane tether is pulled by a bead trapped with an optical tweezer ( Tweez305 , Aresis ) equipped on the Ti2 - A inverted microscope ( Nikon ) . Membrane tubes were pulled to around 10 μm in length and then held until an apparent equilibrium force f was reached ( Fig . S9 ) . Then fluorescence images of the cell and the tether were taken for tether radius ( r ) measurements according to eq . S4 . Force on the bead was calculated from the displacement of the bead from the center of the trap and the trap stiffness ( calibrated before each experiment by applying equipartition theorem to the thermal fluctuation of a trapped bead ) . Then membrane tension σ and bending stiffness 𝜅 𝑚 were be calculated by : 43 𝜎 = 𝑓 2𝜋𝑟 ( eq . S6 ) 𝜅 m = 𝑓𝑟 2𝜋 ( eq . S7 ) Note that the pulling force f may contain contributions from the cytoskeleton and membrane asymmetry . Therefore , a more accurate measure of κ m is to fit f / 2π vs . r - 1 to a linear relation where the slope will report κ m and the intercept will report the aforementioned additional contributions to tether pulling force ( Fig . S9F ) . FRAP measurements 3 to 6 circular ROIs with radius R bleach = 1 . 5 μm were picked on flat regions of HeLa cell expressing hPiezo1 - eGFP . 488 nm laser at full power was used to photo bleach the selected ROI for ~ 1 s . Frames before photobleaching and the first frame after photobleaching were used to normalize the fluorescence intensity , background photobleaching was corrected by tracking the fluorescence of the entire cell . The normalized recovery curve I ( t ) was fitted to the following relation to extract half - recovery time ( 𝜏 0 . 5 , 2 - parameter fit ) : 20 𝐼 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝐼 0 + 𝑡𝜏 0 . 5 1 + 𝑡𝜏 0 . 5 ( eq . S8 ) The diffusion coefficient was calculated by 23 , 64 : 𝐷 cell = 0 . 224 𝑅 bleach2 𝜏 0 . 5 ( eq . S9 ) Model for the curvature sorting of Piezo1 We assume the protein - membrane complex has a preferred curvature C 0 . In the case of Piezo1 , each protein unit would correspond to a trimer of Piezo1 with associated membranes , C 0 represents a balanced shape between the curvature preference of the Piezo1 trimer and the preferred shape of the associated membrane . If we define protrusions ( e . g . , tethers , filopodia ) on the cell to have a negative curvature , then C 0 would be predicted to be positive for Piezo1 - membrane complex , assuming that the associated membranes prefer to be flat . The energy of putting one unit of protein - membrane complex into a membrane of curvature K : 𝐸 b = 1 2𝜅̃𝐴 P ( 𝐾 − 𝐶 0 ) 2 ( eq . S10 ) K is the sum of principle curvatures of the membrane surface . For a flat membrane , K = 0 ; for tubular membrane protrusions of radius R p ( e . g . , filopodia , tether ) , K = - 1 / R p ; for tubular membrane invaginations of radius R i , K = 1 / R i . Here , we ignored the contribution of Gaussian curvature ( the product of principle curvatures ) which is expected to be a constant that only depends on the boundary conditions ( Gauss - Bonnet theorem ) 65 . A p is the area of the protein - membrane complex . 𝜅̃ is the bending stiffness of the protein - membrane complex , which represents the stiffness when bending the membrane ( 𝜅 m ) and the protein ( 𝜅 p ) in series : 1 𝜅̃ = 1 − 𝜃 p 𝜅 m + 𝜃 p 𝜅 p = 1 𝜅 m + 𝜃 p ( 1 𝜅 p − 1 𝜅 m ) ( eq . S11 ) Here , 𝜃 p is the area fraction of the protein in each unit of protein - membrane complex . Measurements of the overall membrane bending stiffness of Piezo1 expressing cells ( ~ 𝜅 m ) , therefore serve as a good estimation for 𝜅̃ when either 𝜃 p is small or when 𝜅 p ≈ 𝜅 m . A recent study suggests that Piezo1 is surprisingly flexible , presenting a bending stiffness similar to that of the lipid membrane 66 . The energy difference between a protein on the curved membrane versus the same protein on a flat membrane : ∆𝐸 = 𝐸 b ( curved ) − 𝐸 b ( flat ) = 1 2𝜅̃𝐴 P ( 𝐾 − 𝐶 0 ) 2 − 1 2𝜅̃𝐴 P ( 𝐶 0 ) 2 = 1 2𝜅̃𝐴 P ( 𝐾 2 − 2𝐶 0 𝐾 ) ( eq . S12 ) Δ E describes the energy change of moving a protein - membrane complex from a flat membrane to a curved membrane , where the flat - curve membrane geometry was pre - equilibrated ( e . g . , a tube pulled from a piece of flat membrane and is held by an external force ) . Note that the model 21 predicts an energy cost of moving a ‘flat protein’ ( C 0 = 0 ) from a flat to a curved region , this is because the ‘flat protein’ will deform the pre - equilibrated curvature , with an energy cost that is larger for bigger proteins . The reference molecule GPI has a much smaller area in the membrane ( ~ 1 nm 2 ) compared to Piezo1 , therefore Δ E for GPI is negligible . Assume the proteins in the membrane can be approximated as 2D ideal gas ( i . e . , no interaction between proteins , density of protein on the membrane is low ) . The density of the protein on the curved membrane relative to its density on the flat membrane follows the Boltzmann distribution : 𝑆 = exp ( −∆𝐸 k B 𝑇 ) = exp [ − 𝜅̃𝐴 P 2k B 𝑇 ( 𝐾 2 − 2𝐶 0 𝐾 ) ] ( eq . S13 ) Note that eq . S13 is essentially the same as equation 8 of ref . 34 or equation 2 of ref . 45 ( under low protein density and negligible protein - protein interaction ) , where free energy - based derivations were presented . For membrane protrusions of radius R p , K = - 1 / R p : 𝑆 = exp [ − 𝜅̃𝐴 P 2k B 𝑇 ( 1 𝑅 p2 + 2𝐶 0 𝑅 p ) ] ( eq . S14 ) which was used to fit the sorting of Piezo1 on membrane tethers ( Fig . 2G ; eq . 1 ) using OriginPro ( 2020 ) . The resulted fitting parameters were , 𝜅̃𝐴 𝑃 = 4800 k B T·nm 2 and C 0 - 1 = 83 nm , corresponding to the nano - geometry of Piezo1 - membrane complex under a resting state . Fix 𝜅̃𝐴 𝑃 = 4800 k B T·nm 2 and fit the data in Fig . 3D ( + Yoda1 ) to eq . S14 , we get C 0 = 0 nm - 1 , potentially corresponding to the nano - geometry of Piezo1 - membrane complex under open or inactive state . For membrane invaginations of radius R i , K = 1 / R i : 𝑆 = exp [ − 𝜅̃𝐴 P 2k B 𝑇 ( 1 𝑅 i2 − 2𝐶 0 𝑅 i ) ] ( eq . S15 ) Note that in eq . S14 , S is a monotonic increasing function of protrusion radius R p . However , the sorting of Piezo1 on membrane invaginations ( eq . S15 ) peaks at invagination radius R i = 1 / C 0 ( Fig . S10 ) . Fig . S10 also shows that the effect of channel opening on Piezo1 sorting ( changing C 0 from 83 - 1 nm - 1 to 0 nm - 1 ) would almost diminish if Piezo1 were 10 times smaller . Lastly , curvature sensing of the 10 - time smaller protein on membrane invaginations would be significantly stronger if the protein also has a 10 - time larger spontaneous curvature C 0 ( 8 . 3 - 1 nm - 1 ) , similar to those of typical BAR domain proteins 40 , 45 .
