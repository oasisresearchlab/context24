LETTER doi : 10 . 1038 / nature14356 Structures of actin - like ParM filaments show architecture of plasmid - segregating spindles Tanmay A . M . Bharat 1 , Garib N . Murshudov 1 , Carsten Sachse 2 & Jan Lo¨we 1 Active segregation of Escherichiacoli low - copy - number plasmid R1 involves formation of a bipolar spindle made of left - handed double - helical actin - like ParM filaments 1 – 6 . ParR links the fila - ments with centromeric parC plasmid DNA , while facilitating the addition of subunits to ParM filaments 3 , 7 – 9 . Growing ParMRC spindles push sister plasmids to the cell poles 9 , 10 . Here , using modern electron cryomicroscopy methods , we investigate the structures and arrangements of ParM filaments invitro and in cells , revealing at near - atomic resolution how subunits and fila - ments come together to produce the simplest known mitotic machinery . To understand the mechanism of dynamic instability , we determine structures of ParM filaments in different nucleotide states . The structure of filaments bound to the ATP analogue AMPPNP is determined at 4 . 3 A˚ resolution and refined . The ParM filament structure shows strong longitudinal interfaces and weaker lateral interactions . Also using electron cryomicro - scopy , we reconstruct ParM doublets forming antiparallel spindles . Finally , with whole - cell electron cryotomography , we show that doublets are abundant in bacterial cells containing low - copy - num - ber plasmids with the ParMRC locus , leading to an asynchronous model of R1 plasmid segregation . Using electron cryomicroscopic ( cryo - EM ) images collected on a direct - electron detector , we performed real - space helical reconstruc - tion to elucidate a 4 . 3 A˚ structure of ParM filaments assembled with the nucleotide AMPPNP ( Fig . 1a – c and Extended Data Fig . 1 , Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Video 1 ) . Densities cor - responding to a - helices , b - strands and many side chains were clearly observed ( Fig . 1d – g ) . AMPPNPwasalsoobservedinourmapasstrong density , especially on the phosphates ( Fig . 1h ) . No apparent resolution anisotropy was detected in the reconstruction ( Extended Data Fig . 1 ) , indicating that the entire ParM protein is rigidly held in the filament . To derive an atomic model of the ParM filament , a previous , mono - meric crystal structure of ParM and AMPPNP bound to the tail of ParR ( Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) accession code 4A62 ) was fitted into the map , and the filament model iteratively rebuilt and all - atom refined using stereochemical restraints with REFMAC . Surprisingly , the two protofilaments ( strands ) making up the dou - ble - helicalParMfilamentareheldtogetheronlybysaltbridges ( Fig . 2a , b , Extended Data Figs 2 and 3 and Extended Data Table 2 ) . The ParM inter - protofilament interface is small ( calculated interface area 371A˚ 2 ) and does not resemble a canonical protein – protein interface contain - ing a hydrophobic core . To demonstrate the validity of this assessment we mutated two positively charged residues within the inter - protofila - ment interfacetoasparticacids ( K258D , R262D ) and testedwhat effect this had on the stability of ParM filaments . Filament formation ( with AMPPNP ) from the resulting mutant protein ParM ( K258D , R262D ) was inefficient ( Extended Data Fig . 3g ) . The few filaments that were formed were unstable , and tended to be bent ( Fig . 2c and Extended Data Fig . 3h ) . Reference - free class averaging of these filaments showed that even though most of the few observed filaments were double helical like wild - type ParM , some single - helical filaments were also present ( Fig . 2d and Extended Data Fig . 3i ) . These observations indi - cate that although the interface between protofilaments in ParM is surprisingly small , it is sufficient for double - helical filament assembly since many identical contacts along the filament contribute to the overall binding energy . Different actin - like proteins show very different filament arrangements , from single ( crenactin , possibly 11 ) to parallel double helical ( left - handed : ParM ; right - handed : actin ; and non - staggered : MamK 12 ) and antiparallel , double straight 1 StructuralStudiesDivision , MRCLaboratoryofMolecularBiology , FrancisCrickAvenue , CambridgeCB20QH , UK . 2 StructuralandComputationalBiologyUnit , EuropeanMolecularBiologyLaboratory , Meyerhofstrasse 1 , Heidelberg69117 , Germany . a 500 Å b d h g c e f Pointedend Barbedend H83 V79 R262 F270 L171 I168 I169 AMPPNP Figure 1 | Cryo - EM reconstruction at 4 . 3A˚ of ParM 1 AMPPNP filaments . a , Cryo - EM image of ParM 1 AMPPNP filaments .

We propose that small and simple inter - protofilament con - tacts could have made it possible to change inter - protofilament arrangements relatively easily during evolution since all these actin - like filaments show similar longitudinal contacts 13 . The protofilaments of ParM themselves are held together by an extensive longitudinal contact area ( , 995A˚ 2 ) , containing bothhydro - philic and hydrophobic interactions ( Extended Data Fig . 2 and Extended Data Table 2 ) . Actin filaments have also been shown to have the same difference in interface size between the longitudinal and lateral contacts 14 – 16 . Interestingly , this difference has also been observed in tubulin polymers , microtubules 17 . The dynamic instability of ParM is caused by intrinsic ATP hydro - lysis in the filament and the resulting ADP - bound filament being less stable 18 , whilebeingtemporallyprotectedbyanATPcap . Wetherefore assembled ParM 1 ATP filaments and obtained a 7 . 5A ˚ cryo - EM struc - ture of these filaments ( Extended Data Fig . 4 ) . Since the nucleotide state of this structure may be mixed , we devised a way to inhibit theATPaseofParMwithvanadate . Additionofsodiumorthovanadate to the ParM 1 ATP solution retarded filament disassembly and we captured these ParM 1 ATP 1 vanadate filaments before complete disassembly and obtained a 6 . 4 A˚ structure ( Extended Data Fig . 4 ) . Comparison of the three cryo - EM structures ( 1 AMPPNP , 1 ATP , 1 ATP 1 vanadate ) indicates that ParM is held in the same rigid , com - pact conformation , either until ATP is hydrolysed to ADP or until phosphate is released ( Extended Data Fig . 4e , f ) . Therefore the state with an expected conformational change should be ADP - bound , and since ParM 1 ADP has a much higher critical concentration for filament formation , we incubated a concentrated solution of ParM with ADP for cryo - EM ( Fig . 2f ) . This specimen yielded a lower resolution reconstruction at 11A˚ . Further refinement wasnot possible , and adding data did not improve theresolutionof the structure ( Fig . 2e and Extended Data Table 1 ) . This indicated marked flexibility in the ParM 1 ADP filaments . Surprisingly , the overall hel - ical pitch of the ParM 1 ADP filaments is smaller than in the other nucleotide states ( ADP : 51A˚ versus 54A˚ ; Fig . 2g and Extended Data Table 1 ) . The previously solved ParM 1 ADP X - ray structure ( PDB 1MWM ) 6 was subdivided into its two domains and these were fitted as rigid bodies into the ParM 1 ADP cryo - EM reconstruction ( Fig . 2h , i ) .

In ParM 1 ADPfilaments , saltbridgesattheinter - protofilamentinterface cannolongerbeformedandratherrepulsingchargesarebroughtclosetogether ( Fig . 2j ) . Additionally , change in helical pitch of the filament may also come with a substantial change in the longitudinal interface . These two factors together could explain why ParM 1 ADP filaments are less stable , and indicate why ParM filaments rapidly dissociate into monomeric form upon ATP hydrolysis , leading to dynamic instability ( Supplementary Video 2 ) . Having described the structure of the ParM filaments , we then wished to put the structural data in context of the bipolar spindles that segregateplasmidDNA in cells . For bipolar spindles toform , filament - ous ParM subunits must engage in another interaction , inter - filament contacts , formed between double - helical filaments . It is known that incubation of ParM filaments with a crowding agent causes them to bundle 19 . However , bundles are not amenable to high - resolution cryo - EM analysis because of their heterogeneity 20 . To obtain a more defined sample , we titrated ParM 1 AMPPNP with varying amounts of crowd - ing agent . When 2 % polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) 6000 was added to ParM 1 AMPPNP , we found that ParM filaments dimerized to form ‘doublets’ , containing two double - helical filaments ( Fig . 3a and Extended Data Fig . 5a , b ) . In raw cryo - EM images , doublets appeared as two roughly parallel lines , with no evidence of supercoiling or twist - ing . Electron cryotomography ( cryo - ET ) of the doublet specimen con - firmed that the filaments do not twist around each other ( Fig . 3b and Supplementary Video 3 ) . We then performed reference - free two - dimensional classification of doublet images ( Fig . 3c and Extended Data Fig . 5c ) . The two ParM filaments in the doublet were perfectly out of phase with each other . When viewed as a projection ( in a cryo - EM class average ) , the thickest part of one filament in the doublet perfectly aligns with the thinnest part of the other double helical filament . We picked small segments along singleParMfilaments thatformedthe doubletsandalignedthesegments to re - projections of the high - resolution ParM 1 AMPPNP structure we solved above . Using this alignment , directionality could be assigned to each filament in the doublet . We found that , in 84 % of the cases , ParM in vitro doublets appeared to be made of two anti - parallel filaments ( Extended Data Fig . 5d ) while opposite matches were probably due to incorrect assignment of the short segments . Using the class averages and the directionality assignment , we obtained an averaged model for the ParM doublet ( Fig . 3d – g , Extended Data Fig . 5e , f and Supplementary Video 4 ) . Two ParM monomers from adjoining filaments in the doublet model were found to be in a similar orientation as observed in a previous crystal structure of ParM ( Extended Data Fig . 6a , b ) 3 . The model of the doublet predicts residues in ParM that should be important in doublet formation ( Fig . 3f , g and Extended Data Table 2 ) and confirmed earlier work , including mutations that modulate the strength of the inter - filament contact . One such set of mutations consisted of S19R and G21R 3 . These mutations had been selected previously because they are located the furthest away from the filament axis , essentially sticking out , but are shown here directly to be involved in the inter - filament contact . In line with this , mutant ParM ( S19R , G21R ) spontaneously formed doublets and bundles ( Extended Data Fig . 6c ) , without any crowding agent present in solution , validating both the previous total internal reflection fluorescence data 3 as well as the current atomic model of the ParM doublet . Previous imaging by total internal reflection fluorescence micro - scopy of the reconstituted ParMRC spindles 3 as well as the model of the ParM doublet derived here are in vitro experiments . To test whether the doublets have physiological relevance , we visualized ParM filaments inside growing E . coli cells . Previously , direct obser - vation of ParM filaments by cryo - EM was only possible by cryo - sec - tioning of frozen bacterial cells since whole cells were deemed too thick 19 . Importantly , in vitreoussections filaments could only bevisua - lized end - on , not revealing much about the inter - filament contacts . Using new direct electron detectors , signal - to - noise has been dramat - ically improved , so we aimed at imaging bipolar spindles directly inside cells using whole - cell cryo - ET . As a first test , we overexpressed a mutant of ParM ( D170A ) that hydrolysed ATP much more slowly in thin E . coli cells . As observed previously in vitreous sections 19 , cryo - ET of these cells ( Fig . 4a ) allowed unambiguous identification of the overexpressed ParM mutant protein through its tendency to form extremely large bundles . We then used plasmids with different copy numbers 21 , all of which contained the entire ParMRC locus and transformed them in turn into E . coli cells . Cryo - ET of these cells revealed the presence of doublets in all cases ( Fig . 4b – d , Supplementary Videos 5 and 6 , Extended Data Fig . 7 and Extended Data Table 3 ) . All doublets were roughly aligned with the long cell axis , and were never observed perpendicular to the cell axis .

These cryo - ET data are in line with previous immuno - light microscopy data , where single pole - to - pole filaments were only observed in 40 % of cells 1 , 10 and the other cells showed several localized clusters or more com - plex patterns . The above data showed that ParM doublets are found in cells con - taining the ParMRC locus , and are probably the machinery that act - ively segregates plasmid DNA to opposite ends of the dividing cell , even though antiparallel arrangement of ParM filaments in cellular doublets can only be inferred from the in vitro studies above . It is interesting to observe that the ratios of doublets observed per cell were the same as the ratios of the expected copy numbers of the three plasmids , although it needs to be noted that numbers remain small because of the low - throughput nature of cryo - ET ( Extended Data Table 3 ) . The ratios might indicate that each doublet carries a defined payload of DNA cargo , a fixed number of plasmids containing the parC locus . We propose that ParMRC spindles consisting solely of doublets elegantly circumvent the problem of synchronizing plasmid replication , filamentattachment and bundleformationforallplasmids in the cell : each pair of plasmid sisters is segregated by their own spindle . The resultingasynchronous plasmidsegregation is schematic - ally summarized in Fig . 4e . Indeed , it is known that R1 plasmids are replicated randomly throughout the cell cycle 23 , 24 . In contrast , eukar - yotic DNA segregation requires cohesion , kinetochore checkpoints and other dedicated machinery since all material is segregated with one coordinated and synchronized spindle .

Cellsweregrownto D 600nm < 0 . 4 – 0 . 6 ( grown to logarithmic growth phase ) before sample preparation for cryo - EM . Cryo - EM grid preparation . Samples for cryo - EM were prepared by pipetting 2 . 5 m l of the sample onto a freshly glow - discharged Quantifoil Cu / Rh 200 mesh grids ( R2 / 2 for purified protein , and R3 . 5 / 1 for cellular tomography ) and plunge frozen into liquid ethane in a Vitrobot Mark IV ( FEI ) . Only for cryo - ET , 11 m l of sample were pre - mixed with 1 m l of protein - A conjugated with 10nm colloidal gold ( Cell Microscopy Center , Utrecht University , The Netherlands ) . Plunged grids were transferred to liquid nitrogen and stored . Electron microscopy data collection . Two - dimensional cryo - EM data were col - lected using either an FEI Krios microscope operated at 300kV or a FEI Spirit microscope operated at 120kV . High - throughput data were collected on the FEI KriosusingEPUsoftwareatanunbinnedcalibratedpixelsizeof1 . 30A˚or1 . 07A˚on a Falcon II direct electron detector . A combined total dose of 25 – 32 electrons per square a˚ngstro¨m was applied with each exposure that lasted 1s . Images were collected at 1 – 6 m m underfocus . Tilt series data were collected on an FEI Krios equipped witha Quantumenergyfilter ( Gatan ) using SerialEMsoftware 27 , ona K2 direct electron detector operating in counting mode . Tilt series data were typically collectedfrom 6 60 u with1 u tiltincrementat4 – 12 m munderfocuswithacombined dose of about 120 electrons per square a˚ngstro¨m applied over the entire series . Image processing and data analysis . Real - space helical reconstruction . An aver - aged power spectrum for each cryo - EM image was calculated using CTFFIND 28 , and images showing clear Thon rings were retained . ParM filaments were extracted from the selected images using SPRING and EMAN2 29 , 30 . The helical symmetry of each sample was accurately determined by comparing the power spectrum of the aligned segments with power spectra of re - projections of the calculated reconstructions . Experimentally determined helical parameters ( Extended Data Table 1 ) were used for refinement using the program segmentrefine3D in SPRING . The final volumes were compensated for the B - factor and filtered to the obtained resolutions ( Extended Data Table 1 ) . Resolution of the structure was estimated using gold - standard Fourier shell cor - relationmeasurementsinSPRINGandadditionallyusingResMap 31 . Visualization of densities was performed in UCSF Chimera 32 . Atomic model building . The atomic structure from PDB 4A62 ( ref . 3 ) was fitted into the cryo - EM density of ParM 1 AMPPNP using MolRep 33 . Maximum - like - lihood refinement of the atomic structure against the cryo - EM density was per - formed in REFMAC5 ( ref . 34 ) using standard protein stereochemistry and additional external restraints based on PDB 4A62 , generated in ProSMART 35 . Model building was performed in COOT and MAIN 36 , 37 . Rigidbodyfitting . ParMwasdividedintotwosub - domains , basedontheprevious ParM 1 ADP X - ray structure ( PDB 1MWM ) . Each sub - domain was declared as a rigid body and these were fitted into the ParM 1 ADP filament structure using REFMAC5 . Polarity assignment of ParM filaments in doublets . First , images of ParM doublets werecarefullyselectedonthebasisofimagequality ( asassessedbyavisualinspection of power spectra ) , and by a visual assessment of the distance between the two fila - mentsinthedoublet . Theassumptionmadefromtheappearanceoftheclassaverages was that images in which the distance between the centres of two ParM filaments in the doublet was maximum would show ParM filaments entirely in the same x – y plane ( the z - axis being the path of the electron beam in the microscope ) . The two ParM filaments in all the doublets in these selected images were picked manually using EMAN2 ( ref . 30 ) . The manual pick was used to extract short segments along eachfilamentinthedoublet . Theextractedsegmentswerealignedtore - projectionsof thehigh - resolutionParM 1 AMPPNPfilamentmodelusingSPRING 29 . Infiveoutof the six doublets analysed , the assigned directionality of ParM filaments was predo - minantly anti - parallel and in one case the assignment was mostly parallel . Derivation of the doublet model . The ParM doublet is not a truehelical specimen , thusconventionalhelicalreconstructioncouldnotbeperformed . Thisdifficultyof characterizing higher - order filament structures of ParM filaments has been prev - iously reported 20 . The average distance between the centres of the two ParM filaments in the doublet was found to be 65 . 1A˚ by analysis of one - dimensional line - profiles ofallobtainedclass averages . Twocopiesofthehigh - resolutioncryo - EM structure of the ParM 1 AMPPNP filaments were accordingly placed with their centres 65 . 1A˚ apart in space in an anti - parallel orientation . The placement was repeated for all possible combinations of the azimuthal angles of both fila - ments . Re - projectionsofalltheseresultingvolumeswerealigned withallobtained class averages . As expected intuitively from an inspection of the class averages , models in which the thickest part of one ParM filament overlapped with the thinnest part of the other filament in the doublet had higher cross - correlation scores . We placed two copies of the atomic structure of the ParM 1 AMPPNP in the volume with the highest score . Since this was not a standard cryo - EM recon - struction , meaning resulting atomic accuracy would be somewhat lower , we only used the C a atoms for determining distances shown in Extended Data Table 2 . Tomographic reconstructions . Tilt series data were aligned using IMOD 38 and three - dimensionalreconstructionswereconductedusingtheSIRTalgorithmimple - mented in Tomo3D 39 .

Thisexperimentwas repeated four times . h , Randomly selected cryo - EM images of ParM 1 AMPPNP and ParM ( K258D , R262D ) 1 AMPPNP were used to count occurrences of straight and bent filaments by visual inspection . The results of this quantification are shown as a percentage bar diagram . For the ParM protein , 82 % of all filaments were classified as straight , while 18 % were bent ( n 5 345 ) . Using exactly the same classification criteria , only 15 % of the filamentswerefoundtobestraightand85 % ofthefilamentswerebent ( n 5 45 ) for the ParM ( K258D , R262D ) mutant protein . i , Reference - free class averages show that most of the ParM ( K258D , R262D ) filaments are made up of double protofilaments like wild - type ParM . Some class averages show evidence of bending . A few class averages show that single protofilaments were present in thesample ( lowerpanels ) .
