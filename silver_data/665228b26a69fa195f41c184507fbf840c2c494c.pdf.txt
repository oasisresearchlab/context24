Cell Death and Disease ( 2022 ) 13 : 812 ; https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41419 - 022 - 05174 - 0 INTRODUCTION Distant metastasis is the main cause of mortality in breast cancer patients [ 1 ] . Patients with metastatic breast cancer generally presents poor prognosis , with an average 5 - year survival rate of about 27 % [ 1 ] . Although surgery , targeted therapy , and radiation therapy have been used to control primary tumor growth , they are not very effective in preventing relapses and in the management of breast cancer metastases . Identi ﬁ cation of novel regulators of metastasis may provide potential prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for cancer intervention . Ca v 2 . 2 belongs to a voltage - dependent calcium channel family , which is required for maintaining Ca 2 + homeostasis in normal cells [ 2 ] . Ca v 2 . 2 is expressed in excitable cells such as neurons , allowing calcium in ﬂ ux after responding to a depolarization of membrane potential [ 3 ] . It regulates SNARE - mediated release of neurotrans - mitters , eventually resulting in synaptic transmission [ 4 ] . It is also the main force in supporting transmission of sensory information from nociceptors to spinal cord dorsal horn neurons . Speci ﬁ c inhibition of Ca v 2 . 2 such as ziconotide , an FDA - approved drug , can be used for chronic pain [ 5 – 8 ] . Modulation of Ca v 2 . 2 is involved in synaptic plasticity , synaptogenesis , gene transcription , neuronal survival , and the migration of immature neurons [ 9 , 10 ] . Moreover , bi - allelic loss - of - function Ca v 2 . 2 variants have been found in progressive epilepsy - dyskinesia , leading to disruption of Ca 2 + in ﬂ ux and subsequent impaired synaptic neurotransmission [ 11 ] . These studies demonstrated that Ca v 2 . 2 plays an irreplaceable role in normal human neural development . However , whether Ca v 2 . 2 is involved in cancer development is largely unknown . Cancer cells endowed with the ability to degrade extracellular matrix ( ECM ) can invade surrounding tissues , a crucial step toward in the spreading of the primary tumor and metastasis formation [ 12 , 13 ] . Notably , invasive cells accomplish this process through invadopodia , a special protruded cell membrane structure with proteolytic activity [ 14 – 19 ] . The protrusive ability of invadopodia is obtained by combining the physical force generated by actin polymerization with the chemical activity of matrix metalloprotei - nase ( MMP ) - mediated ECM degradation [ 20 ] . A number of signaling pathways including cytoskeletal modulators , adhesive molecules , membrane traf ﬁ cking regulate invadopodia formation [ 21 , 22 ] . Actin binding protein cortactin plays an essential role in invadopodia formation [ 23 , 24 ] . It directly binds to Arp2 / 3 and N - WASP to promote actin assembly at invadopodia puncta [ 25 – 30 ] . In addition , cortactin regulates ECM degradation through facilitating the secretion of matrix metalloproteinases [ 24 , 27 , 31 ] . It has been shown that cortactin can be regulated by phosphor - ylation and acetylation [ 32 – 36 ] . However , it has not been studied whether deubiquitination process can regulate cortactin and its functions in invadopodia formation .

We showed that Ca v 2 . 2 expression was upregulated in breast cancer tissues and cell lines but was absent in normal breast epithelial cells as well as normal breast tissues . We demonstrated that Ca v 2 . 2 was required for breast cancer migration , invasion , and metastasis . Mechanistically we showed that Ca v 2 . 2 promoted invadopodia formation and focal matrix degradation . Conversely , knockdown of Ca v 2 . 2 expression sup - pressed invadopodia formation and ECM degradation . In addition , we showed that deubiquitinating enzyme USP43 stabilized cortactin and mediated the functions of Ca v 2 . 2 in invadopodia formation and metastasis in breast cancer . Taken together , we discovered a novel pathway that Ca v 2 . 2 regulated invadopodia formation through deubiquitination process .

Tumor transplantation in mice In vivo tumor transplantation assay was performed as described previously [ 38 ] . The MDA - MB - 436 human breast cancer cell lines stably expressing Firel ﬂ y Luciferase gene with Ca v 2 . 2 shRNA or control shRNA were suspended in 100 μ l of PBS and injected in the lateral tail vein of 6 – 8 weeks old female NOD / SCID mice . Then , IVIS 200 Imaging system ( Xenogen Corporation , Hopkinton , MA ) was used to image mice bearing luciferase positive tumors . The primary tumors and lung metastasis were analyzed using bioluminescent ﬂ ux ( photons per second per steradian per centimeter square ) . In order to minimize the number of animals we used power analysis to calculate the minimum sample size using the free software DOEUMH ( https : / / samplesizeumh . shinyapps . io / DOEUMH ) based on the TrialSize library of the R program ( R Core Team ) . We selected the procedure KMeans – ANOVA , ﬁ xing the signi ﬁ cance to 0 . 05 , power to 0 . 08 , and a drop - out of 5 % . We took into consideration differences between averages of about 1 . 5 – 2 fold . Minimum number of mice / group : 5 – 6 mice / group . Animal experiment protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC ) of the Zhongshan Hospital . Animal procedures were conducted in compliance with the IACUC . Invadopodia formation assay Sterile coverslips were incubated in 0 . 1 mg / ml poly - D - lysine for 10 minutes at room temperature followed by incubating 2 % gelatin ( Sigma ) for 1 h at 37 °C . Then , coverslips were added 0 . 25 % gluteraldehyde / PBS for 15 min followed by PBS wash three times . Coverslips were then incubated for 15 min in 5 mg / ml NaBH 4 followed by PBS wash three times . The coverslips were then incubated at 37 °C in 10 % calf serum / RPMI1640 for 2 h . Cells were seeded on each coverslip and incubated for 8 h , and ﬁ xed at 37 °C in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) / PBS for 15 min , permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 / PBS for 10 min , and blocked with 3 % goat serum .

Brie ﬂ y , sterile coverslips were coated with a mix of 0 . 1 mg ml − 1 poly - d - lysine followed by incubation with 0 . 4 % glutaralde - hyde for 20 min and PBS wash three times . Oregon Green ™ gelatin 488 was diluted 1 : 50 with 0 . 1 % unconjugated gelatin and used to coat coverslips at 37 °C for 1 h . Coverslips were then incubated with 5 mg / ml NaBH 4 for 1 min , followed by 70 % ethanol for 20 min . Three washes with 1 × PBS were performed between each step . RPMI1640 media was added to the coverslips at 37 °C for 1 h before cell plating . The coverslips were then incubated at 37 °C in 10 % calf serum / RPMI1640 for 2 h .

DAPI ( Cat . # : D3571 , Invitrogen ) was used to visualize nuclei . Images were taken using Olympus BX43F microscope . Gelatin degradation was quanti ﬁ ed using ImageJ software . To measure the percentage of degraded area in each ﬁ eld , identical signal threshold for the Oregon Green - gelatin ﬂ uorescence is set for all images and the degraded area with Oregon Green signal Y . Xue et al . 2 Cell Death and Disease ( 2022 ) 13 : 812 below the set threshold was measured by ImageJ . The resulting percentage of degradation area was further normalized to total number of cells ( counted by DAPI staining for nuclei ) in each ﬁ eld . The ﬁ nal gel degradation index is the average percentage degradation per cell obtained from ﬁ elds . Protein stability assay To examine cortactin protein turnover , cycloheximide ( 0 . 1 mg / ml ) was added to cell culture medium and cells were harvested at the indicated time points .

Measurement of intracellular calcium Cells were loaded with calcium - sensitive ﬂ uorescent dye 1 μ M Fura - 2AM ( Beyotime ) for 40 min at room temperature in the dark and then washed three times in standard external solution of 145 mM NaCl , 2 . 8 mM KCl , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM D - glucose , 10 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 4 , with NaOH . Fluorescence was measured with ﬂ uorescence spectrophotometer by varioskan LUX ( Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c ) , where excitation was performed at 340 nm and 380 nm . The ﬂ uorescence intensity ( F340 / F380 ) indicated an intracellular calcium concentration . Dual luciferase reporter assay USP43 promoter was cloned into pGL3 basic plasmid to construct pGL3 - USP43 promoter - Luc plasmid . MDA - MB - 231 cells were cultured in 12 - well plates . MDA - MB - 231 cells expressing control vector or NFAT2 were co - transfected 500 ng USP43 promoter - Luc plasmid and 20 ng Renilla using lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) . Fire ﬂ y and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using the dual - luciferase reporter assay system 48 h after transfection ( Cat : # E1910 , Promega ) . Chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) ChIP were performed according to manufacture ’ s protocol ( Cat : # 53040 , - Active motif ) . Brie ﬂ y , two 10 cm dishes MDA - MB - 231 cells were cross - linked and lysed . Cells were sonicated using the Bioruptor Pico ( Diagenode ) for 30 s on / 30 s off for 15 cycles . Chromatin was immunopre - cipitated with the speci ﬁ c antibody at 4 °C overnight , followed by incubation with protein A / G beads for 3 h at 4 °C .

RESULTSIdenti ﬁ cation of Ca v 2 . 2 in breast cancer progression To identify critical genes that drive breast cancer progression , we analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) RNA - seq data of breast cancer and normal breast tissues and the relevant survival data of breast cancer patients [ 38 ] . From the analysis , 41 genes were identi ﬁ ed that met the four inclusion criteria as described previously [ 38 ] . In this study , we focused on the calcium channel Ca v 2 . 2 because ( 1 ) very little is known about its functions in cancer development ; ( 2 ) it is expressed in breast cancer but not in normal tissues other than brain ; ( 3 ) it is a cell surface protein which can be targeted by small molecule compounds or antibodies ; ( 4 ) FDA - approved therapeutics targeting Ca v 2 . 2 is already used in clinics for chronic pain . We ﬁ rst determined the Ca v 2 . 2 expression in a panel of normal human tissues and found that it is exclusively expressed in adult and fetal brain tissues ( Fig . 1A ) . Interestingly , Ca v 2 . 2 expression was upregulated in breast cancer tissues than adjacent normal breast tissues ( Fig . 1B ) . In particular , Ca v 2 . 2 expression was signi ﬁ cantly upregulated in triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) ( Fig . 1C ) , which has worse prognosis than other subtypes in breast cancer . Consistent with the Ca v 2 . 2 expression in breast cancer tissues , Ca v 2 . 2 was expressed at various levels in breast cancer cell lines but not in human normal breast epithelial cell line HMEL ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . In paired human breast cancer samples , Ca v 2 . 2 expression was signi ﬁ cantly higher in the metastatic samples than in the matched primary breast cancer samples ( Fig . 1D ) . We further investigated the correlation of Ca v 2 . 2 expression with survival . Patients with higher Ca v 2 . 2 expression had worse overall survival than those with lower Ca v 2 . 2 expression in breast cancer ( Fig . 1E ) and the TNBC subtype ( Fig . 1F ) . Taken together , these data indicated that Ca v 2 . 2 expression is up - regulated in breast cancer and a potential prognosis marker for survival . Ca v 2 . 2 is required for breast cancer invasion and metastasis As Ca v 2 . 2 appeared to have higher expression in metastatic tissues than in primary tumors and metastasis is a major factor in patient survival , we assessed the role of Ca v 2 . 2 in breast cancer invasion and metastasis . We introduced Ca v 2 . 2 into human breast cancer cell BT549 which expresses endogenous Ca v 2 . 2 at a very low level . The expression of Ca v 2 . 2 in BT549 was con ﬁ rmed by real - time PCR ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . The cells were subjected to transwell assays . Ca v 2 . 2 signi ﬁ cantly increased cell migration and invasion ( Fig . 2A , B ) without affecting cell proliferation ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . To investigate whether Ca v 2 . 2 is required for migration and invasion , we introduced short hairpin RNA constructs into human breast cancer cell lines MDA - MB - 231 and MDA - MB - 436 . Knock - down of Ca v 2 . 2 expression was con ﬁ rmed by real - time PCR ( Supplementary Figs . 4 and 5 ) . Ca v 2 . 2 knock - down signi ﬁ cantly reduced cell migration and invasion in MDA - MB - 231 and MDA - MB - 436 ( Fig . 2C – F ) without affecting cell growth ( Supplementary Fig . 6 , Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . To investigate the function of Ca v 2 . 2 in metastasis , we knocked down Ca v 2 . 2 in luciferase - tagged MDA - MB - 436 cells and transplanted these cells into mice . Nine out of ten mice transplanted with cells expressing a control shRNA construct developed metastasis ( Fig . 2G ) , only two out of ten mice transplanted with cells expressing Ca v 2 . 2 shRNA developed metastasis ( Fig . 2G ) . The luciferase signal of metastasis was also much higher in these nine mice ( Fig . 2G ) . These results indicated that Ca v 2 . 2 was required for cell migration , invasion , and metastasis . Ca v 2 . 2 promotes invadopodia formation and extracellular matrix degradation The invasiveness of cancer cells depends on their ability to degrade extracellular matrix ( ECM ) and invade into neighboring tissues as well as lymph node and bloodstream [ 12 , 39 ] . Their invasiveness is decided by special cell membrane structure Y .

Xue et al . 4 Cell Death and Disease ( 2022 ) 13 : 812 invadopodia which are dynamic actin ‐ enriched cell protrusions with proteolytic activity . Co - localization of F - actin with the actin - bundling protein cortactin can be used to identify invadopodia [ 40 ] . To dissect the cellular functions of Ca v 2 . 2 in invadopodia formation , Ca v 2 . 2 knock - down or over - expression cells were plated on gelatin matrix and labeled for F - actin and cortactin . We found that knock - down of Ca v 2 . 2 potently suppressed the ability of MDA - MB - 231 cells to form invadopodia ( Fig . 3A , B ) . Conversely , Ca v 2 . 2 overexpression signi ﬁ cantly increased invado - podia formation in BT - 549 cells ( Fig . 3C , D ) . Interestingly , immuno ﬂ uorescence also showed that Cav2 . 2 knock - down signi ﬁ cantly decreased ﬂ uorescence intensity of cortactin ( Sup - plementary Fig . 8A ) , whereas Ca v 2 . 2 overexpression signi ﬁ cantly increased cortactin ﬂ uorescence intensity ( Supplementary Fig . 8B ) . These results suggested that Ca v 2 . 2 modulates cortactin protein expression . Since functional invadopodia are able to degrade localized ECM , we determined whether Ca v 2 . 2 was required to accelerate focal matrix degradation by gelatin degradation assay . Indeed , Ca v 2 . 2 knock - down cells showed a signi ﬁ cantly reduced capability to degrade focal ECM ( Fig . 3E , F ) . Conversely , expression of Ca v 2 . 2 led to dramatically increased degradation of focal ECM ( Fig . 3G , H ) . Taken together , these data demonstrated that Ca v 2 . 2 is suf ﬁ cient and required for invadopodia formation and ECM degradation . Ca v 2 . 2 stabilizes cortactin in a proteosome - dependent manner To gain insight into the underlying mechanism of Ca v 2 . 2 in the regulation of invadopodia formation , we examined whether Ca v 2 . 2 regulated the cortactin expression given that cortactin plays a key role in the formation of invadopodia and invadopodia associated ECM degradation [ 41 – 43 ] and our immuno ﬂ uorescence analysis showed Ca v 2 . 2 regulated cortactin expression . Immuno - blotting analysis showed that the cortactin protein expression was greatly decreased after Ca v 2 . 2 knock - down in MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Fig . 4A ) , whereas the cortactin transcript was not changed in Ca v 2 . 2 knock - down cells ( Fig . 4B ) . Conversely , expression of Ca v 2 . 2 in BT - 549 cells resulted in a signi ﬁ cant increase of cortactin protein expression ( Fig . 4A ) , but not cortactin transcript ( Fig . 4C ) . These results suggested a mechanism involving post - transcriptional regulation of cortactin . Ubiquitination and deubiquitination are among the most widely - used protein modi ﬁ cations in regulating cellular signaling and homeostasis [ 44 ] . Because ubiquitination generally modulates target expression by inducing proteasome ‐ dependent degradation [ 45 ] , we added the proteasome inhibitor MG132 into MDA - MB - 231 cells expressing Ca v 2 . 2 shRNA or control shRNA . We found that the decrease in cortactin expression by Ca v 2 . 2 knock - down could be reversed by the addition of MG132 , suggesting that Ca v 2 . 2 regulates cortactin in a proteasome ‐ Fig . 3 Cav2 . 2 promotes invadopodia formation and ECM degradation .

To further assess the effects of Ca v 2 . 2 on cortactin stability , we added cycloheximide ( CHX ) which suppresses protein synthesis and monitor the degradation of cortactin protein . As shown in Fig . 4E , cortactin stability was dramatically decreased in Ca v 2 . 2 knock - down cells . These results demonstrated that Ca v 2 . 2 stabilizes cortactin in breast cancer cells . We next examined whether Ca v 2 . 2 regulated cortactin ubiquitina - tion or deubiquitination in breast cancer cells . As shown in Fig . 4F , knock - down of Ca v 2 . 2 in MDA - MB - 231 cells strongly increased the ubiquitination of cortactin . These data demonstrated that Ca v 2 . 2 modulated the protein stability of cortactin through ubiquitination or deubiquitination process in breast cancer cells . Identi ﬁ cation of USP43 as a deubiquitinating enzyme for cortactin stability As Ca v 2 . 2 is a calcium channel protein located on the cell surface , it is unlikely that it directly deubiquitinates cortactin . To gain insight how Ca v 2 . 2 decreased cortactin ubiquitination , we analyzed the correlation between the expression of cortactin and ubiquitin ligases or deubiquinating enzymes by using the proteomics data from Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia ( CCLE ) database . Candidates from the analysis should satisfy the following criteria : ( 1 ) p value and q value below 0 . 01 ; ( 2 ) the Pearson correlation coef ﬁ cient above zero if the candidate is a deubiquitinase . Conversely , Pearson correlation coef ﬁ cient below zero if the candidate is a E3 ligase . Only six deubiqui - tinating enzymes ( DUBs ) , USP43 , OTUD1 , OTUD4 , OTUD7A , USP40 , USP54 met our criteria . We then transfected the cDNAs of these six DUBs into MDA - MB - 231 cells , and immunoblotting showed that only USP43 increased cortactin expression ( Supplementary Fig . 9A ) . The expressions of these six DUBs were con ﬁ rmed by real - time PCR ( Supplementary Fig . 9B – G ) . We ﬁ rst determined whether USP43 interacted with cortactin . Immunoprecipitation showed that USP43 interacted with cortactin in MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Fig . 5A ) . Knock - down of USP43 in MDA - MB - 231 cells decreased the expression of cortactin at the protein level ( Fig . 5B ) but did not affect its transcript ( Fig . 5C ) . Conversely , over - expression of USP43 increased cortactin protein expression without affecting its expression at the transcriptional level ( Fig . 5D , E ) . The addition of MG132 successfully rescued the decrease of cortactin expres - sion caused by USP43 knock - down ( Fig . 5F ) , while the addition of CHX resulted in more unstable cortactin protein in USP43 knock - down cells ( Fig . 5G ) . These results demonstrated that USP43 stabilized cortactin protein in MDA - MB - 231 cells . We next investigated whether USP43 was able to modulate cortactin ubiquitination in MDA - MB - 231 cells . Knock - down of USP43 increased the addition of ubiquitin on cortactin ( Fig . 5H ) . Together , these results suggested that USP43 directly regulates cortactin stability through deubiquitination .

A Ca v 2 . 2 and cortactin were determined by immunoblotting in MDA - MB - 231 cells stably expressing Ca v 2 . 2 shRNA or control shRNA and BT - 549 cells transfected with Ca v 2 . 2 cDNA or a control vector .

Xue et al . 6 Cell Death and Disease ( 2022 ) 13 : 812 USP43 mediates the functions of Ca v 2 . 2 in cortactin stabilization , invadopodia formation , and metastasis in breast cancer To determine whether USP43 mediated the functions of Ca v 2 . 2 , we introduced Ca v 2 . 2 shRNA and USP43 cDNA constructs into breast cancer cells . Immunoblotting showed that cortactin expression was stabilized in Ca v 2 . 2 knock - down cells expressing USP43 ( Fig . 6A ) , indicating USP43 mediated the function of Ca v 2 . 2 in cortactin stabilization . We further investigated whether USP43 mediated Ca v 2 . 2 function in invadopodia formation , we expressed USP43 cDNA in Ca v 2 . 2 knock - down cells and found that USP43 expression rescued the decrease of invadopodia formation caused by Ca v 2 . 2 knock - down ( Fig . 6B , C ) . Similarly , focal matrix degradation was also rescued in USP43 cDNA expression cells ( Fig . 6D , E ) . To further investigate if USP43 mediated the function of Ca v 2 . 2 in metastasis in vivo , we transplanted luciferase - tagged MDA - MB - 436 cells stably expres - sing Ca v 2 . 2 shRNA and USP43 cDNA constructs into mice . Seven out of ten mice transplanted with cells expressing Ca v 2 . 2 shRNA and USP43 developed metastases , whereas two out of ten mice expressing Ca v 2 . 2 shRNA developed metastasis ( Fig . 6F ) . The luciferase signal of metastasis was also signi ﬁ cantly higher in mice injected with cells expressing Ca v 2 . 2 shRNA and USP43 ( Fig . 6F ) . These results indicated that USP43 mediated the functions of Ca v 2 . 2 in cortactin expression , invadopodia formation , ECM degradation , and metastasis . USP43 is directly regulated by NFAT2 We then investigated the regulation of USP43 by Ca v 2 . 2 and found that knock - down of Ca v 2 . 2 decreased USP43 expression whereas over - expression of Ca v 2 . 2 increased USP43 expression transcrip - tionally and at the protein level ( Fig . 7A – C ) . These results showed that Ca v 2 . 2 is suf ﬁ cient and required for USP43 expression . We further explored the molecular mechanism of this regulation . Because Ca v 2 . 2 is a calcium channel , we ﬁ rst tested whether [ Ca 2 + ] i ( intracellular calcium level ) was changed upon the decrease or increase of Ca v 2 . 2 expression . [ Ca 2 + ] i was signi ﬁ cantly decreased in Ca v 2 . 2 knock - down cells ( Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . Conversely , [ Ca 2 + ] i level was signi ﬁ cantly elevated in Ca v 2 . 2 overexpression cells ( Supplementary Fig . 10 ) . These results con ﬁ rmed that Ca v 2 . 2 regulates calcium in ﬂ ux . Calcium in ﬂ ux activates heterodimeric phosphatase calcineurin , which dephosphorylates NFAT family proteins ( NFAT1 , NFAT2 , NFAT3 , NFAT4 ) andresults in their nuclear translocation [ 46 ] . Nuclear NFAT family proteins activate target gene expression , thus directly linking calcium signaling to gene expression [ 46 ] . We then investigated whether NFAT proteins were able to modulate USP43 mRNA expression . We found that depletion of NFAT2 and NFAT3 could signi ﬁ cantly reduced USP43 mRNA expression ( Fig . 7D , Supplementary Fig . 11 ) . However , the knock - down of NFAT1 and NFAT4 did not decrease USP43 mRNA expression ( Supplementary Fig . 12 ) . We further determined the USP43 protein expression in NFAT2 or NFAT3 knock - down cells . NFAT2 or NFAT3 knock - down resulted in the decrease of USP43 Fig . 5 USP43 interacts with and deubiquitinates cortactin . A Cortactin were determined by immunoblotting in MDA - MB - 231 cells expressing Flag - tagged USP43 or control vector following Flag - tag immunoprecipitation . B Cortactin were determined by immunoblotting in MDA - MB - 231 cells expressing USP43 shRNA or control shRNA . C Cortactin and USP43 transcripts were determined by qRT - PCR in MDA - MB - 231 cells expressing USP43 shRNA or control shRNA . P value was determined using Student ’ s t - test ( * p < 0 . 001 ) .

Xue et al . 7 Cell Death and Disease ( 2022 ) 13 : 812 protein expression ( Fig . 7E , Supplementary Fig . 13 ) . The ChIP analysis showed that NFAT3 did not bind to the NFAT consensus sequence in the USP43 promoter region we studied , but binded to the BACE1 promoter region which is a well - established direct target gene of NFAT3 and served as a control [ 47 ] ( Supplementary Fig . 14A , Supplementary Fig . 14B ) . It is possible that NFAT3 binds to the other regions of USP43 promoter or indirectly regulates USP43 expression . Since we intend to ﬁ nd a transcription factor that directly regulates USP43 expression , we chose to focus on NFAT2 for further study . We transduced NFAT2 cDNA into MDA - MB - 231 cells . Expression of NFAT2 increased USP43 mRNA and protein expression ( Fig . 7F , G ) . These results suggested that USP43 is regulated by NFAT2 . To determine whether USP43 is a direct target of NFAT2 , we found two consensus binding sites ( ggaaa ) of NFAT2 in the USP43 promoter region ( Fig . 7H ) [ 48 ] . To verify whether USP43 is directly regulated by NFAT2 , we cloned USP43 promoter ( − 213 ~ − 1847bp ) into pGL3 - basic vector and performed dual luciferase reporter assay . NFAT2 expression signi ﬁ cantly increased the luciferase signal driven by the USP43 promoter ( Fig . 7H ) . We used Chromatin Immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) analysis to further determined the direct interactions of NFAT2 with USP43 promoter in MDA - MB - 231 cells , ChIP analysis indicated the signi ﬁ cant enrichment of USP43 promoter as well as BMI1 promoter which is a well - established direct target gene of NFAT2 [ 49 ] and served as a control in NFAT2 immunoprecipitation ( Fig . 7I , Supplementary Fig . 15 ) . These data suggested that NFAT2 directly regulates USP43 transcription . Ca v 2 . 2 regulates USP43 expression through NFAT2 dephosphorylation We further investigated whether NFAT2 mediates the function of Ca v 2 . 2 in USP43 regulation . We knocked down NFAT2 expression in Ca v 2 . 2 over - expression cells and determined USP43 expressions . NFAT2 knock - down abolished the up - regulation of USP43 levels by Ca v 2 . 2 ( Fig . 8A , B ) . These data indicated that NFAT2 mediates the regulation of USP43 by Ca v 2 . 2 . We next determined the molecular mechanism of NFAT regulation by Ca v 2 . 2 . Ca v 2 . 2 knockdown increased the phosphorylation of NFAT2 and its cytoplasmic localization , while decreased NFAT2 nuclear localiza - tion . ( Fig . 8C – E ) . Together , these experiments suggested that Ca v 2 . 2 is required for the direct regulation of USP43 by NFAT2 . DISCUSSION The functions of calcium channels in tumor metastasis are poorly understood . Our study identi ﬁ ed the role of calcium channel Ca v 2 . 2 in breast cancer metastasis and its underlying mechanism ( Fig . 9 ) . Ca v 2 . 2 was required for metastasis by promoting invadopodia formation . Surprisingly deubiquinating enzyme USP43 mediated the function of Ca v 2 . 2 in invadopodia formation Fig . 6 USP43 mediates the function of Cav2 . 2 in cortactin stabilization , invadopodia formation , ECM degradation and metastasis in breast cancer . A Ca v 2 . 2 and cortactin were determined by immunoblotting in MDA - MB - 231 cells expressing Flag - tagged USP43 and Ca v 2 . 2 shRNA or control shRNA . B MDA - MB - 231 expressing USP43 cDNA and Ca v 2 . 2 shRNA or control shRNA were subjected to invadopodia formation assay .

Xue et al . 8 Cell Death and Disease ( 2022 ) 13 : 812 by stabilizing cortactin , a critical component of invadopodia . Strikingly , Ca v 2 . 2 regulates USP43 mRNA and protein levels by activating calcineurin / NFAT2 signaling . To our knowledge , this is the ﬁ rst time calcium channel Ca v 2 . 2 and deubiquitination process have been shown to play roles in invadopodia formation . Our study also revealed the functions of deubiquitinase USP43 in breast cancer cell migration , invasion , and metastasis . These studies uncovered a novel pathway that regulated invadopodia formation and metastasis in breast cancer . Ca v 2 . 2 is exclusively expressed in neuronal tissues but not in breast epithelial cells . The expression of a tissue - speci ﬁ c gene in the cancer of another tissue type presents a unique opportunity for therapy development . For an example , neuronal - speci ﬁ c glutamate receptor GRM1 is aberrantly expressed in melanoma and has been shown to play a critical role in melanoma development . GRM1 inhibitors as therapies for melanoma are currently in clinical trials . Ziconotide is an FDA - approved Ca v 2 . 2 blocker for the treatment of severe and chronic pain . It is worthwhile to determine if ziconotide and other N - type calcium channel blockers can be used as therapies for the treatment of breast cancer metastasis . Development of novel Ca v 2 . 2 blockers that are not able to cross blood – brain barrier may be even better for the treatment of breast cancer metastasis . Invadopodia formation is required for breast cancer cells to degrade extracellular matrix and invade neighboring tissues [ 50 ] . However , invadopodia is dif ﬁ cult to target for therapy develop - ment because the main components of invadopodia F - actin and actin regulatory proteins are structurally undruggable . Our ﬁ nding that deubiquiting enzyme USP43 regulates invadopodia formation may present a novel therapeutic target for the suppression of invadopodia and metastasis . Our studies opened up a number of questions regarding the roles of Ca v 2 . 2 , NFAT2 and USP43 in invadopodia formation and metastasis . USP43 functions as a deubiquitinase . We have shown that cortactin is a substrate of USP43 in this study . Whether other factors in metastasis are also substrates of USP43 is unknown . The identi ﬁ cation of substrates of USP43 that regulate invadopodia formation and metastatic process will improve our knowledge of the roles of ubiquiting process in metastasis . Cortactin regulation is also complex . In addition to the deubiquitination process we identi ﬁ ed , it has been shown that phosphorylation can also regulate cortactin activity [ 36 , 51 ] .
