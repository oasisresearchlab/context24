These models provide an opportunity to connect academia with real - world environments . One connection of particular importance is the one linking engineering education and society : how can engineering education connect learning with some of the most pressing global sustainability challenges we currently face ? As a result , universities are turning to communities globally in search for opportunities to connect students with sustainability related issues . The appearance of academic offerings including international courses , global exchanges and fellowships abroad among others , are a testament to the efforts within higher institutions to create these bridges . From a scholarly perspective , literature describing these kinds of community - based programs has been on the rise . However , the majority of these programs , and the research surrounding them , are almost exclusively focused on the potential transformation this connection brings to learners , much less on what community - based interaction means for engineering education transformation . This paper is an effort in bridging that gap . The “Technology Design for Coffee Production : A Co - Design Experience” , is a community - based course on technology design and engineering offered to an interdisciplinary group of graduate students , primarily from the Massachusetts Institute of Tech - nology ( MIT ) . The course was facilitated directly from within coffee farms in Colombia in collaboration with local groups over the course of a month . We conclude that three principles are promising for future community - based engineering education of - ferings : 1 ) community immersion ; 2 ) positioning local community members as learning instructors ; 3 ) thick contextualization of the engineering design process . We discuss how each of these principles is reﬂected in the curriculum of the course , and how they were implemented . Future work includes further examining lessons and expanding them into other engineering education offerings at MIT including a revised second edition of the course to graduate students from all ﬁve schools at MIT .

I NTRODUCTION Connecting students with community - based work is not a recent trend in higher education programs in engineering [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] . Through various formats , universities and colleges are integrating a variety of activities allowing students to explore new directions for their academic life and connect newly learned skills with real - world problems . From within academic programs at these institutions , it is now common for engineering , science and design departments to provide course offerings that include elements of ﬁeldwork in cooperation with communities globally [ 4 ] . Community - based engineering courses have proven to be effective in enhancing students’ learning and motivation [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , [ 9 ] , as well as in providing opportunities to embed socially oriented aspects such as conﬂict management and social justice principles into curricula [ 10 ] . Our work adds to this literature by providing an account of a community - based course in technology engineering for coffee production at MIT , implemented in collaboration with rural coffee growers in Colombia . These courses have the potential to yield valuable lessons to engineering education . Curriculum changes driven by areas such as humanitarian engineering [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 11 ] and service learning [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] are already underway . This paper is an effort in expanding this body of work by presenting an analysis of what we consider useful principles to make community - based courses effective . Our work innovates within community - based programs in engineering education , by making members of partnering com - munities act beyond the traditional roles of clients / users [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] or codesigners [ 17 ] . Although these categories recognize community stakeholders as possessors of key knowledge and expertise , it does not necessarily position them as deliverers of content in the same way a professor or an instructor is positioned . This paper reviews our experience shifting this power dynamic and reﬂects on how they affect students . II . B ACKGROUND The course is inspired by prior academic offerings . For example , the MIT D - Lab [ 18 ] offers courses connecting stu - dents with communities across the world , through projects in areas ranging from prosthetic and assistive technology development , all the way to biomass - based charcoal produc - tion [ 19 ] , [ 20 ] . The Affordable Design and Entrepreneurship program at the Olin School of Engineering [ 21 ] , provides a similar offering for undergraduate education with an added focus on entrepreneurship [ 22 ] . The d . school at Stanford University also features a course with similar characteristics concentrated in design for extreme affordability [ 23 ] . The course connects with a body of work done in collaboration with Colombian rural farmers through the International Development Design Summits ( IDDS ) program in Colombia [ 28 ] , [ 29 ] , [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] . From a theoretical perspect - ive , the course draws inspiration from the Creative Capacity Building methodology [ 39 ] . This model describes philosoph - ical underpinnings of the work as well as the reasoning behind active learning approach to teaching . One particular aspect of the course is its focus on a speciﬁc economic sector : coffee . The fact that worldwide , coffee is positioned in the agriculture sector as one of the top traded commodities according to the FAO [ 24 ] , makes it an interesting context for engineering work . Academic focus on issues surrounding prosperity and sustainability is on the rise . Examples include Ssozi - Mugarura et al . [ 25 ] work done in participation with community members in rural Uganda on water management , Capaccioli et al . [ 26 ] study on participatory energy infrastructure in the northwestern Italian region , and Siozos study of collective assessment applications for secondary education along with Greek communities [ 27 ] . Finally , the course poses an innovative premise by position - ing community members as content instructors . This approach is motivated by work showing the beneﬁts of including re - search participants as active members and contributors of research teams , or what is known as co - research [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] . It builds on literature in the ﬁeld of Participatory Design pointing to the beneﬁts of this type of dynamic in designing research projects [ 34 ] , as well as in the production of knowledge through research [ 35 ] . III . T ECHNOLOGY D ESIGN FOR C OFFEE P RODUCTION : A C O - D ESIGN E XPERIENCE A . Motivation and Intended Learning Outcomes Every year during the January period , MIT offers a program with for - credit and not - for - credit courses to all undergradu - ate and graduate students . These classes provide students the opportunity to freely explore other topics beyond their academic requirements . Our course was part of this program , and was offered to students as a not - for - credit subject . The Intended Learning Goals are for students to leave the course being able to : 1 ) recognize all stages in the process of small - scale coffee production in a rural region of central Colombia ; 2 ) plan and facilitate design research sessions through ﬁeldwork activities ; 3 ) conduct agricultural processes related to small - scale coffee production ; 4 ) create functional , 1 : 1 scaled engineering prototypes in collaboration with rural community members ; and 5 ) develop engineering projects that take social , cultural and business aspects into consideration . B . Structure of the Course 1 ) Students selection and team formation : The course was designed to cater to advanced degree students in three areas of knowledge : engineering , social sciences and business . Students applied to the course via a survey designed to surface prior collaboration , engineering and communication skills . The se - lection process included diversity ( across multiple vectors ) , past experiences and interest in the coffee sector as the main variables . Following the selection process , students were divided into two groups and paired with two rural small - scale coffee - growing collectives . Three to four leading members from each collective , along with two design facilitators , completed each group . Families and neighbors at each community constituted a second layer of support . A map of all these resources was handed over to teams in the form of a social cartography [ 36 ] . 2 ) Partner Selection : The course partnered with two cof - fee farming collectives : De Finca [ 37 ] , a coffee farming organization from the Guavio Alto community in the Sumapaz region of central Colombia , tasked with “producing and trans - forming top quality artisanal coffee” ; and APRENAT [ 38 ] , an organization from Central Colombia with the mission to “contribute to the conservation of natural resources , ecological diversity , and the ancestral farming culture in the Tibacuy re - gion” . The selection of these partners was based on prior work and research done by the course instructors and focused on identifying collectives with ongoing projects , and interested in collaborating with university students . It included community workshops to map needs and opportunities for projects , collect key information around stakeholders , infrastructure , assets , as well as other relevant information for students . It also included preparations related to room and board , transportation , safety and other logistical details . Figure 1 . Immersion activity , understanding connections between beekeping and coffee production at APRENAT . 3 ) Curriculum and course stages : The duration of the course was 21 days . This timeline was divided into four stages , most of which included engineering practice activities . Table 1 presents the layout of the curriculum . Although our focus was on hands - on work , we acknowledge that context is key , therefore small part of the beginning of the program was dedicated to expose students the various aspects of small - scale coffee production in Colombia . It comprised four different teaching strategies : a ) theoretical and conceptual foundations through visits to organizations , talks and lectures ; b ) interactive , practical activities to develop ﬁeldwork skills ; c ) collaborative work activities leading to project formulation and execution ; and d ) machining and manufacturing activities . These strategies were chosen based on the IDDS program model [ 28 ] . Stage 1 . Focused on contextualizing students with the process of small - scale coffee production , in reference to each coffee - growing collective . This included in - person sessions with experts and other participants in the small - scale cof - fee production chain , as well as facilitated sessions with key institutions such as the National Coffee Federation of Colombia . Each partnering collective also provided in - depth background on local needs and opportunities . Stage 2 . The goal was two - pronged . First , to provide students with an immersive experience within each partnering . Second , to allow students to gather crucial information about projects by being in the ﬁeld . Activities in this stage ranged from procuring , preparing and planting seedlings , to packaging for sale and distribution . For the majority of this stage , community members acted as course instructors . Stage 3 . This stage was focused on several iterations of planning , designing , and gathering feedback , all of them orchestrated in collaboration with partnering collectives . Each team was required to produce functional 1 : 1 prototypes . These were manufactured by teams at a local university . Stage 4 . The last stage of the process focused on installation and testing of prototypes . These were presented to each collective to its larger community in an open - door local show - case . These gatherings featured hands - on sessions teaching community members and farmers from neighboring villages how to replicate the prototypes produced . Table I C URRICULUM O VERVIEW 4 ) Results : Details about APRENAT and De Finca proto - types can be found on Table I and II respectively . Although the course also included prototypes in business and social dimensions , they are not reported in this paper . The APRENAT group focused on conservation of bees that pollinate crop plantations , in return , providing beneﬁts to the quality of coffee . Prototypes included a sensorized beehive , a manual honey press , and mobile point - of - sale furniture . The De Finca group worked on integrating an automated cooling system to an existing low - cost , locally manufactured coffee roaster . The system included power conditioning for the room where the roaster was installed , and the provision of protective gear . Table II APRENAT R ESULTS Table III D E F INCA R ESULTS IV . C ONCLUSION Based on our experience implementing this course , we highlight what we consider to be three key principles in facilitating this type of learning experience and discuss some of its challenges : 1 ) engaging in full community immersion ; 2 ) positioning coffee farmers as learning instructors ; 3 ) thick contextualization of the engineering design process . A . Community immersion By facilitating ﬁeld - based design engineering , key con - textual aspects to the engineering process of developing a technology are made available to students . For example , practicing activities related to the problem at hand along with local community members , can change the learning paradigm , providing students with a situated view from the user’s perspective . This optic can be enriched with information about social , organizational , cultural and environmental values , all key elements to engineering and design , but rather difﬁcult to imbue into a classroom - based experience . Through immersion , experience becomes the compass for projects , there are no pre - established results . In the APRENAT project for example , this ﬂexibility allowed the team to discover the virtuous cycle between beekeeping and coffee - growing , and pivot the project in that direction . This type of shift can be difﬁcult to recreate in a classroom setting . Immersion allows for bonds of trust and communication to be strengthened , both of which are fundamental for long - term sus - tainability of projects . It is to be said that managing all these moving pieces can be cumbersome . For example , ensuring availability from community members , making sure sessions are effective , providing safe environments in a remote location , and managing transportation needs requires signiﬁcant effort . B . Community members as facilitators Coffee is a craft : expertise is passed from generation to generation . Through this course , we are learning that including students as part of this cycle can yield valuable lessons for engineering education . Through a feedback survey following the end of the program , students reported gaining greater appreciation for non - traditional forms of knowledge as a result of learning directly from farmers . This shifting in power dynamics , where members of a traditionally marginalized group now occupy a position of privilege , could make it easier for students to externalize their own knowledge gaps and strengths . However , we acknowledge there is room to build on this power redistribution and explore mechanisms to better equalize beneﬁts across all stakeholders . Our future work will focus on expanding these reﬂections . C . Thick contextualization of design engineering processes Course outcomes were tightly adapted to local conditions . Prototypes used only products and tools of easy local access . They were made in close partnership with community mem - bers , allowing for future production and dissemination as well as local repair and improvement . Their performance was optimized based on local conditions ; for example , by adapting features and parameters of a coffee dryer based on local humidity and temperature . Thick contextualization allows for gaps in knowledge to be identiﬁed and bridged on site . An engineer who inter - venes and participates in the co - creation of any device , is capable of quickly identifying which speciﬁc knowledge must be transferred locally , for example , to improve the use and maintenance of a given technology . Community work requires speciﬁc times , context helps highlighting local needs and limitations given that resources at disposal are scarce and expensive . This represents a direct call to creativity embodied by the need to solve problems with what the environment offers V .
