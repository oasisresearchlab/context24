These prop - fect in the H4 mutant , implying that the two proteins erties suggested that Cse4p and histone H4 might be act together in centromere structure . We show by necessary for kinetochore function as direct structural chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments that Cse4p components of the S . cerevisiae centromere ( Pluta et is specifically cross - linked to centromeric DNA .

Thus , defining the role of CSE4 has the nucleosome containing Cse4p . potential to significantly enhance our understanding of centromere structure and function . However , to date Introduction there has been no evidence that Cse4p either directly affects centromere structure or is physically located in The eukaryotic centromere is a complex nucleoprotein centromeric chromatin . structure containing centromeric DNA ( CEN DNA ) , chro - Here , we report the results of experiments designed mosomal proteins , and the kinetochore , a multiprotein to address two central questions : first , are histone H4 molecular motor ( Pluta et al . , 1995 ) .

Like hhf1 - 20 , cse4 - 103 cells alsoarrest in mitosisatrestrictive temperature . The mitotic arrest of both mutants is mediated by the spindle / kinetochore checkpoint , consistent with a spe - cific deficit in centromere function ( Smith et al . , 1996 ; data not shown ) . We first examined the structure of CEN3 in mutant and wild - type cells using the nuclease sensitivity assay devised by Saunders et al . ( 1988 ) ( Figure 1A ) . The natu - rallyoccurring clusterof DraIrestrictionsites inthe CDEII region of CEN3 is normally protectedfromnucleasediges - tion due to the presence of the centromere / kinetochore protein complex . Detrimentalmutations in the CEN DNA or depletion of the core histones H2B or H4 increases the accessibilityofCDEIIto DraIendonucleasedigestion ( Saunders et al . , 1988 , 1990 ) . As can be seen in Figure 1B , the DraI sites within CDEII of CEN3 were inaccessible from wild - type cells grown at 37 (cid:56) C . In hhf1 - 20 cells grown at the permissive temperature of 28 (cid:56) C , the CDEII region was slightly more accessible with about 9 % digestion . However , at the restrictive temperature of 37 (cid:56) C , this increased to 30 % – 37 % cleavage , indicating a significant change in centro - mere accessibility . Similar results were obtained for cse4 - 103 ( Figure 1C ) . At restrictive temperature , the CDEII centromere chromatin structure became very ac - cessible to DraI digestionwith as much as 36 % of mole - cules digested at the highest enzyme concentration tested as compared to 4 % for the wild type . We reasonedthatif the disruptionof centromere chro - matin structure plays a causative role in the Ts pheno - Figure 1 .

Noncentromeric loci were not enriched ( Fig - ure 2A and data not shown ) . Thus , Cse4p specifically cally interacts with histone H4 , it seemed likely that Cse4p , Histone H4 in the Yeast Centromere 609 Cse4p would be found in these centromere - proximal nucleosomes . To more finely map the extent of the Cse4p – CEN DNA interaction , potential enrichment of DNA sequences immediately flanking either CEN3 or CEN16 was assessed . Asshown in Figure 2B , the Cse4 - HAp – CEN DNA interaction is actually confined to the immediate vicinity of the CEN DNA , as has been ob - served for Mif2p , Ndc10p , and Cbf1p ( Meluh and Kosh - land , 1997 ) . This result is consistent with the notion that a single specialized Cse4p - containing nucleosome resides at the CEN DNA in vivo . Cse4 - HAp Localization As Cse4p is structurally related to histone H3 , a general DNA - binding protein , it was possible that Cse4p binds at other chromosomal loci that were not monitored in the cross - linking experiments . We reasoned that if this were the case , Cse4p would be generally nuclear ; whereas , if Cse4p interacts primarily with centromeric regions , its distribution would be more restricted . Thus , it was of interest to determine the intracellular localiza - tion of Cse4p . The distribution of Cse4 - HAp in asynchronously grown CSE4 - HA cells was determined by indirect immunofluo - rescence using ananti - HA antibody ( Figure 3 ) . This anal - ysis revealed adiscrete , subnuclearstaining patternthat varied with respect to cell cycle stage . In unbudded and small budded cells ( i . e . , early in the cell cycle ) , a single focus of staining in the vicinity of the spindle pole body ( SPB ) was observed . In cells with short spindles ( i . e . , Figure 2 . In Vivo Cross - Linking Analysis of Cse4p G 2 / M ) , Cse4 - HAp staining often appeared as a short bar ( A ) Coimmunoprecipitation of CEN DNA with epitope - tagged Cse4 - coincident with nuclear microtubules .

In the model , Ndc10p binding actually not generally distributed throughout the chromosomes spreads around the spatial center of CEN DNA , ex - and suggest that it may be exclusively localized to CEN tending antiparallel to CDEII on the adjacent turn of the DNA .

Finally , the this Cbf1p / CDEI complex and assures the rotational histone complex would provide a smooth superhelical freedom of the complex implied by the 3 – 4 bp length path for the DNA , preventing kinks and other severe heterogeneity of natural CDEII elements . deformations when force is applied to the kinetochore . This model provides explanations for three unusual Why should this structure require Cse4p rather than features of the yeast centromere . First , it explains the the major histone H3 protein ? As a consequence of genetic interactions between CDEI and CDEIII and their having Cse4p and H4 within the core centromere , CBF3 associated proteins , sites separated by over 80 bp of must bind to CDEIII in the context of a histone – DNA DNA ( Murphy etal . , 1991 ; Niedenthal et al . , 1991 ; Sorger complex ( for example , Figure 4 ) .

Wrapping the specificity of CBF3 is conferred by Cep3p , a member of CEN DNA around a histone core brings CDEI and CDEIII the Zn2 / Cys6 DNA - binding protein family that includes together such that Cbf1p could physically interact with Gal4p ( Lechner , 1994 ; Strunnikov et al . , 1995 ) . One role CBF3 . Second , itprovides anexplanationforthe unusual of Cse4p may be to provide a specialized N - terminal length conservation of CDEII .

Third , it ex - Relationship to Mammalian Centromeres plains the puzzling functional asymmetry of CDEIII in The simplicity of the CEN DNA elements in S . cerevisiae and the lack of obvious CBF3 homologs in mammalian which Ndc10p spreads downstream away from CEN Cse4p , Histone H4 in the Yeast Centromere 611 eukaryotic centromeres has not revealed any short , unique DNAconsensus sequencecommon to all centro - meres in a given organism ( reviewed in Karpen and All - shire , 1997 ; Wiens and Sorger , 1998 ) . Thus , answers to questions of centromere identity in higher eukaryotes may be found among the cis - and trans - acting determi - nants of CENP - A targeting in human cells ( Shelby et al . , 1997 ) . Given the emerging structural similarities be - tween yeast and human centromeres , we anticipate that future studies aimed at defining the structural require - ments for the Cse4p – CEN DNA interaction in budding yeast will likewiseprovide insight into the general mech - anism whereby functional centromeres are specified . Experimental Procedures Media and Strains All DNA and bacterial manipulations were by standard protocols ( Sambrook et al . , 1989 ) . Yeast growth media , as wellas transforma - tion , sporulation , and DNA isolation protocols were carried out as described previously ( Rose et al . , 1990 ) . The cse4 : : LEU2 disruption allelewasmadebyreplacingthe415bpEcoRV - SphI fragmentwithin the CSE4 gene with a 2 . 1 kb LEU2 fragment . The CSE4 - HA epitope - tagged allele was constructed by inserting a 138 bp XbaI fragment encoding three copies of the hemagglutinin eptiope at the XbaI site in CSE4 . The resulting gene encodes 275 amino acid residues , in which the triple epitope occurs after codon 81 of the normal CSE4 coding region .
