The system showed great potential for complementing estab - lished mechanical characterization methods such as Atomic Force Microscopy ( AFM ) , par - allel plate compression ( PPC ) , and nanoindentation , while significantly reducing the volume of valuable hydrogels used for testing . We achieved a volume reduction of ~ 0 . 22 μ l / sample using the μ Tweezers vs . ~ 157 μ l / sample using the PPC , while targeting high - throughput measurement of widely adopted micro - mesoscale ( a few hundred μ m - 1500 μ m ) 3D cell cul - tures . The μ Tweezers applied and measured nano - millinewton forces through cantilever’ deflection with high linearity and tunability for different applications ; the assembly is compat - ible with typical inverted optical microscopes and fit on standard tissue culture Petri dishes , allowing mechanical compression characterization of arrayed 3D hydrogel - based organoids in a high throughput manner . The average achievable output per group was 40 tests per hour , where 20 organoids and 20 reference images in one 35 mm petri dish were tested , illustrating efficient productivity to match the increasing demand on 3D organoids’ applica - tions . The changes in stiffness of collagen I hydrogel organoids in four conditions were mea - sured , with ovarian cancer cells ( SKOV3 ) or without ( control ) . The Young’s modulus of the control group ( Control—day 0 , E = 407 ± 146 , n = 4 ) measured by PPC was used as a refer - ence modulus , where the relative elastic compressive modulus of the other groups based on the stiffness measurements was also calculated ( control - day 0 , E = 407 Pa ) , ( SKOV3 - day 0 , E = 318 Pa ) , ( control - day 5 , E = 528 Pa ) , and ( SKOV3 - day 5 , E = 376 Pa ) . The SKOV3 - embedded hydrogel - based organoids had more shrinkage and lowered moduli on day 0 and day 5 than controls , consistently , while SKOV3 embedded organoids increased in stiffness in a similar trend to the collagen I control from day 0 to day 5 . The proposed method can contribute to the biomedical , biochemical , and regenerative engineering fields , where bulk mechanical characterization is of interest . The μ Tweezers will also provide attractive design and application concepts to soft membrane - micro 3D robotics , sensors , and actuators .

Background The lack of cell - matrix interaction in typical 2D culture models compared to 3D models illus - trates the importance of 3D biomimetic environment models [ 1 , 2 ] . For instance , studies have reported increased drug resistance in 3D cultures compared to 2D monolayer models , indicat - ing that 3D models better represent in vivo conditions [ 3 , 4 ] . The use of 3D models has shown great potential in studying different types of cancer , developing a better understanding of the 3D environmental cellular cues and signals [ 2 ] , supporting the existing therapeutic approaches , and creating novel targeted precision medicine approaches [ 5 ] . As one example , Epithelial Ovarian Cancer ( EOC ) is among the most lethal diseases for women . Most women are diagnosed with late - stage ( III / IV ) disease , and unfortunately , high percentages of late - stage diagnosed patients are in danger of dying of their disease . Early and rapid metastasis is considered one of the leading causes of high lethality . The tumor 3D orga - nization and microenvironment peculiarities are linked with the tumor metastasis and resis - tance to therapy [ 4 ] . In vitro models that mimic such a 3D microenvironment is crucial to find better treatment . On the cellular level , the substrate or hydrogel matrix has a significant effect on the status of the cultured cells . Parameters that characterize extracellular matrix ( ECM ) include substrate structure , source , type [ 6 ] , fiber mesh , density , porosity , diffusivity , attachment site characteristics , physical and chemical cross - linkers , incorporated growth factors , supplements , medium , and matrix stiffness [ 7 ] . Similarly , pH , ionic concentration , and temperature can influence ECM architecture and collagen polymerization . All together constitute a complex microenvironment that affects how the cultured cells respond [ 7 , 8 ] . The cell phenotype , including geometry and morphology , were reported to have strong cor - relations to the microenvironment . Many have investigated substrate stiffness as the envi - ronmental parameters on the cell morphology ( acini , rounded , protrusions , or invasive ) . Different epithelial cancer cell lines have shown various morphological cellular behaviors in response to substrate stiffness [ 9 ] . The matrix stiffness has been well reported to signal stem cell lineage and phenotype com - mitment with extreme sensitivity to tissue level elasticity [ 10 ] . Mechanical characterization of the substrate stiffness or elastic modulus has been increasingly reported in 3D bio - tissue stud - ies . The substrate stiffness , topography , rigidity , immobilized and soluble signals affect cell adhesion , differentiation , migration , and proliferation through the focal adhesion - cytoskeleton dynamics , consequently affecting cell behaviors and fates [ 11 ] . The biomechanical testing methodologies of 3D samples applied in the field varied based on many factors , including and not limited to the research questions being investigated : the scale of samples , nature of the characterization and type of testing , equipment availability , and sufficient sensitivity . For example , short - term traction force measurements of individual cells cultured in 2D format on hydrogels would benefit from 2D traction force microscopy [ 12 – 14 ] or 3D traction force microscopy techniques [ 15 ] ; while cellular tractions cultured in a 3D context within matrices would benefit from a similar approach of 3D traction force microscopy that is also based on embedded microbeads [ 16 ] . The optical tweezer also has its advantages , such as high sensitivity and disadvantages , such as the small measurable / applicable force ranges [ 17 ] , photodamage , lack of selectivity , and exclusivity . Shear / flow - based microfluidics are typically used for tar - geted applications [ 18 ] . Rheology testing is widely used for hydrogel characterization . When considering rubber elasticity theory [ 19 ] , where rubbery shear modulus G is independent of the frequency , measurements can be made in a low - frequency mode , assuming quasi - static deformation . However , microscopic heterogeneities observed in a variety of hydrogels are lost in this bulk measurement .

A . and K . H . have no intellectual propertyin this study . Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) has many versions developed over time , where each modality accommodates certain operation features with extremely high resolution . The reader is directed to the detailed review of AFM imaging modes [ 20 ] . Considerable efforts were made to standardize nanomechanical AFM procedure ( SNAP ) for soft and biological sample mea - surements , where they reported reduced variability ( 1 % ) in hydrogel elastic moduli evaluation and increased consistency in elasticity measurements by a factor of two [ 21 ] . However , since AFM measurements are extensively utilized for localized tissue and mechanical cell measure - ments [ 19 , 22 ] , they have been reported to be less suited [ 23 ] for bulk mechanical characteriza - tion of collagen hydrogels [ 19 ] and larger structures including multicellular spheroids [ 24 ] . AFM - based cantilevers were tested with several instruments for different applications and test - ing conditions [ 20 ] , with various spring constants and probe dimensions and applicable con - tact models [ 25 ] . Some tools have recently become commercially available for mechanical testing of 3D tissue cultures . Chondrospheres ( spheroids of chondrocytes ) have been mechanically characterized using micro - scale parallel - plate compression testing , Microsquisher ( CellScale ) [ 26 ] . Another tool ( Pavone by Optic11 ) is commercially available for mechanobiological screening in 96 well - plates ; this system is based on a glass - fiberoptic cantilever bending and force sensing . However , the Pavone operates based on a single cantilever which must go in and out of every well ; concerns relating to open - chamber , potential cross - contamination , and repeated bubble generation between wells may dramatically affect the efficiency of testing time . Our group has reported micromechanical tweezer systems , where spin - coated photopoly - mer ( SU - 8 ) - based cantilevers in a micro tweezer format were used to analyze the stiffness of healthy and cancer breast spheroids directly . Moreover , agarose hydrogel pillars of various concentrations were tested , and the approach was neatly validated with ball indentation mea - surements [ 24 ] . However , SU - 8 is not an FDA - approved material for biological applications , and microcantilevers may easily break during handling . Spin - coated elastomer ( polydimethyl - siloxane ( PDMS ) ) - based cantilevers were reported for the stiffness monitoring of zebrafish embryos during embryonic development stages [ 27 ] . Both reported micro tweezer systems had low - profile designs to conduct side compression testing of biological samples using bright - field inverted microscopes while allowing testing under a confocal microscope as well . How - ever , the side tweezer approach may hinder efficient arrayed sample testing in the same petri dish and further complicate the design of sterile closed - chamber long - term testing , which may add the material supplies , time , and cost needed to conduct such experiments . 1 . 2 . This study’s approach This study reports the design , fabrication , and testing of our novel PDMS - based micro twee - zers ( μ Tweezers ) . The tweezer system fits on top of Petri dishes / culture plates on an inverted microscope for efficient 3D arrayed organoid / tissue mechanical characterization . The design aims to boost the technologies to test biological samples in the micro - mesoscale range to match the increasing demand for mechanical testing of 3D tissue cultures . The μ Tweezer sys - tem can mechanically characterize 3D tissue cultures of defined structures , including and not limited to hydrogel pillars , organoids , spheroids , tumoroids , chondrospheres . The system fab - rication relied on the widely available milling and molding techniques [ 28 ] rather than previ - ously reported spin - coating approaches [ 24 , 27 ] . The 3D elastomer molding technique allowed the fabrication of mechanically functional 3D PDMS devices with sub - millimeter - scale resolu - tion . The manipulator interface allowed the transfer of forces from external precision micro - actuators to PDMS - based end - effectors ( cantilevers ) , delivering micro - indentations to the bio - PLOS ONE Biocompatible micro tweezers for 3D hydrogelorganoidarray mechanical characterization PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0262950 January 24 , 2022 3 / 20 samples . The deflections of the calibrated cantilevers were measured and analyzed through microscopic observation to acquire the stiffnesses of the sample groups . To demonstrate the efficacy of the μ Tweezers , we created arrayed organoid pillar samples from bioactive collagen I hydrogels embedded with an ovarian cancer cell line ( SKOV - 3 ) as a 3D in vitro model to study human ovarian cancer [ 4 , 29 ] . Trending 3D tissue culture models for cancer cells include but are not limited to spheroids and organoids , either hydrogel - free or hydrogel - based [ 4 , 30 ] . Such models have been utilized to study the cellular behavior in response to the 3D matrix or hydrogel environment , which is believed to represent the original tissue characteristics [ 31 ] . There is a growing demand for user - friendly , accurate mechanical characterization devices to be used with standard lab equipment and tissue culture ware while maintaining high force sensitivity and long - term biocompatibility . Many of the available high - end technologies rely on delicate alignment and calibration , requiring intensive user training to get accurate and reliable data , which may deter the progress in the growing field . In addition , customizations to existing high - end equipment may not always be financially justifiable or the preferred route . Our system’s properties can be easily tuned and customized to accommodate the sensitivity , spring constant , and sizes of different 3D models . The platform is biocompatible for long - term use , which provides an attractive tool in biomedical and biochemistry fields , including regen - erative engineering , personalized medicine , and biomaterials sciences . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Device design , fabrication , and testing 2 . 1 . 1 System design . The overview and the platform assembly are shown in Fig 1 . The sys - tem has three main subassembly sections : 1 . Actuator . A custom - built precision positioning system ( Fig 1A ) consisting of an Arduino controller , electronic motor drivers , stepper motors , couplers , fine adjustment screws , externally threaded nuts ( Thorlabs Inc . , Newton , NJ , USA ) , 3D printed flexure - based actua - tor camshafts ( Shapeways Inc . , New York , NY , USA ) fixed on a machined ABS plate ( Mcmaster carr , Elmhurst , IL , USA ) . The camshafts ( framed in Fig 1B ) get lowered into the manipulator , while the motion of the actuator tower and camshafts is further explained in the following figure . 2 . Manipulator . A cup - shaped insert made of PDMS . It includes thin membranes , which work as the interface to transfer the motion and force from the actuator camshafts to the micro end - effectors ( cantilevers ) . The manipulator thin membranes ( ~ 50 μ m ) are perme - able to CO 2 [ 32 ] and provide transparency for top illumination . 3 . End - effectors . The end effectors are cantilevers made of PDMS . The cantilevers’ typical dimensions were 2 . 8 mm ( length ) × 800 μ m ( width ) × 50 μ m ( thickness ) for 10X imaging magnification . The actual measured dimensions are discussed in the cantilever design section . The system is compatible with 35 and 60mm Petri dishes ( open chamber for endpoint tests ) and 24 - well tissue culture plates ( closed chamber for time - course experiments ) . The platform operates in combination with an inverted microscope consisting of precision x - y - z stages , CMOS camera ( Chameleon3 CM3 - U3 - 50SM , FLIR Systems Inc . , Wilsonville , OR USA ) , and a 4X or 10X objective lens ( United Scope LLC dba AmScope , Irvine , CA , USA ) , a computer installed with ImageJ ( Version 1 . 52a , National Institute of Health , Bethesda , MD , USA ) and MATLAB ( Version R2019a , Mathworks , Natick , MA , USA ) .

The two camshafts are actuated by the stepper motors ( Fig 2A – 2C ) . The cams push the elastic hinges supported by a membrane built in the manipulator ( Fig 2D – 2G ) . The platform performance and linearity rely on the accuracy of the camshafts’ positioning and con - tact to the PDMS manipulator interface .

Acrylic ( PMMA ) blocks obtained from ( Mcmaster carr , Elmhurst , IL , USA ) were machined using a high - resolution CNC milling machine ( monoFab SRM - 20 , Roland DGA Corp . , Irvine , CA , USA ) , creating fine 3D structured molds to be used for PDMS casting / molding ( Fig 3 ) . Similarly , acrylic jigs were machined for the end - effectors’ installation . This jig is used when the cantilevers are aligned and glued to the manipulator aided by precision - guided mechanical stages . A drop of PDMS was used as glue , and the jig held the cantilevers in place during curing . The elastomer molding technique allowed easy and accurate fabrication of mechanically functional 3D PDMS devices with a micro - scale resolution . The PDMS ( Sylgard 184 Silicone elastomer - Dow Corning Corp . , Midland , MI , USA ) base and curing agent mixtures were pre - pared at a 10 : 1 ratio , respectively . All PDMS parts throughout this study used the same mixing ratio , as suggested by the manufacturer . Degassing took place in a desiccator for 15 minutes ( Bel - Art Products , Inc . , Wayne , NJ , USA ) . The molds were then sandwiched , vise clamped , and placed in a convection oven at 65 C˚ for 12 hours curing time . In this study , the elastic modulus of the PDMS cantilevers was calibrated and measured ( 2 . 46 MPa ) [ 28 ] . Only the PDMS molds in ( Fig 3L ) were cured for 3 hours at 65 C˚ . Another PDMS stiffness refining approach would be by changing the PDMS curing condi - tions without changing the geometry . Increased hardness can benefit some PDMS parts of the assembly ( e . g . , the manipulator or stiffer end - effectors ) . However , excessive crosslinking cur - ing agent ratios were avoided to avert the potential of excess crosslinking agent leaching out into cell culture and maintain high PDMS elasticity , which also supports the PDMS actuation Fig 3 .

Further relevant fabrication and curing condition details were previously reviewed and reported [ 28 ] . 2 . 1 . 3 Cantilever design and calibration . The cantilever formulas allow easy tuning / refin - ing of the geometry . Therefore , it is easy to tune the spring constants based on the required specifications , including sample size , linear range & sensitivity . Our dimensions ( L = 2 . 8 mm , W = 800 μ m , and T = 150 μ m ) were designed to measure soft stiffness ranges which were ade - quate and applicable to the collagen - based samples used in this study . The following equation gives the spring constant of a cantilever : K ¼ EI L 3 ð 1 Þ Where ( E ) is Young’s modulus of the cantilever , and ( L ) is the cantilever length . For rectangu - lar cantilevers , the second moment of area ( I ) is given as I ¼ WT 3 12 ð 2 Þ using the cantilever width ( W ) and thickness ( T ) . The Eq ( 1 ) can be substituted and rewritten as : K ¼ EWT 3 4 L 3 ð 3 Þ Based on the design dimensions and the elastic modulus E = 2 . 46 MPa we found in our pre - vious study [ 28 ] , the calculated PDMS cantilever spring constant was ( 0 . 0765 N / m ) , and COMSOL stationary solid mechanics’ simulation resulted in a spring constant ( 0 . 08 N / m ) . The spring constant calculated using the measured average cantilever thickness ( 148 ± 1 . 9 μ m , n = 8 ) was ( 0 . 0725 N / m ) , and the updated COMSOL spring constant became ( 0 . 079 N / m ) . Before using , we calibrated the cantilever spring constant using a reference cantilever ( RRC ) with a known spring constant ( 0 . 151 N / m ) . The detailed method of the cantilever cali - bration was previously reported by our group [ 27 ] . Based on Hook’s law , an applied force results in a linear elastic deformation as follows : f ¼ Kr dr ¼ Kc dc ð 4 Þ Where ( f ) is the force , ( Kr ) is the RRC spring constant , ( dr ) is the RCC displacement , ( Kc ) is the spring constant of the PDMS cantilever , and ( dc ) is the PDMS cantilever displacement . The calibration resulted in a spring constant ( 0 . 0718 ± 0 . 0073 N / m , n = 3 , R 2 = 0 . 98 ) . In our system , the end - effectors work both as an indenter and a sensor simultaneously . By knowing the spring constant , the optically measured end - effector’s displacement represents the linear applied forces . 2 . 1 . 4 Manipulator sterilization . The PDMS manipulators , end - effectors , and sample molds were soaked with Isopropanol alcohol 70 % for 20 minutes , rinsed with sterile water , and dried in a sterile biosafety cabinet . Autoclaving PDMS parts was avoided because the heat can dramatically change the spring constant and device performance between different sterili - zation cycles and affect stiffness measurements . 2 . 2 . Biosample preparation 2 . 2 . 1 Collagen I hydrogel neutralization ( all steps chilled on ice ) . Nine parts of Collagen I solution from bovine skin ( C4243 , Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) were added to a 15 ml tube containing one part of the neutralizing solution ( 5229 , Advanced BioMatrix , Inc . , San PLOS ONE Biocompatible micro tweezers for 3D hydrogelorganoidarray mechanical characterization PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0262950 January 24 , 2022 8 / 20 Diego , CA ) . The pre - formulated neutralizing solution is a 10X PBS that has been pH adjusted using basic NaOH . For consistency with hydrogel - based organoids that included cells and to get a softer hydrogel range , one part of the neutralized hydrogel was diluted with two parts media , either with cells or without cells , which roughly further diluted the collagen I concen - tration to ~ 1 . 86 – 2 mg / ml . 2 . 2 . 2 Hydrogel pillar array preparation protocol . The preparation steps of the hydrogel pillar array are shown in Fig 4 , followed by actual images representing the success of steps . Fig 4 illustrates the preparation of the hydrogel pillar array , which utilized the PDMS mold ( see Fig 3L ) with a fixed pillar geometry . The pillar was sized 750 μ m in diameter and 500 μ m in height , while the PDMS mold diameter was 15 mm . Each mold has 45 pillars with sufficient distance in between to allow for distances between samples . The hydrogel molding protocol in Fig 4 was inspired by a suspended hydrogel pillar protocol [ 33 ] . Our study further modified the protocol to fix the hydrogel pillars to the petri dish for efficient array testing . The PDMS mold was surface - functionalized using an oxygen plasma cleaner ( PDC - 32G , Harrick Plasma Inc . , Ithaca , NY , USA ) for 1 minute at 18W power ( high RF ) and a Pluronic F - 127 solution ( 1 % v / w , P2443 - Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) in steps 1 – 4 . After the neu - tralization of hydrogel , time - sensitive steps of surface treatment and hydrogel casting , gelling , and leveling ( steps 5 – 8 ) must be conducted promptly . The side of the non - machined PDMS mold is smooth and shiny , while the machined side has a rougher surface . The non - machined ( shiny ) side should always be used as the side that attaches to the petri dish to prevent the Pluronic F - 127 solution from leaching between the PDMS mold and the petri dish . Using the Fig 4 . ( Steps 1 – 10 ) Hydrogel casting / molding protocol . ( A ) the PDMS mold showing the non - machined , shiny side ; ( B ) acrylic leveler which had a smooth surface and sufficient weight was used to force excess hydrogel to the sides ( step 7 ) ; ( C ) After the leveler was removed , media was added ( step 9 ) ; ( D ) PDMS mold was the peeled off , and arrayed hydrogel pillars are ready for mechanical testing shown in ( E ) . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0262950 . g004 PLOS ONE Biocompatible micro tweezers for 3D hydrogelorganoidarray mechanical characterization PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0262950 January 24 , 2022 9 / 20 smooth side for attachment is also essential to avoid slipping the mold , which would dislocate the pillars from the dish . 2 . 2 . 3 Cell culture . For stiffness analysis , a human ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line SKOV3 was used , which was derived from the ascitic fluid of a 64 - year - old Caucasian female with an ovarian tumor ( 91091004 , Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) . They were cultured on treated cell culture flasks in 2D monolayers in McCoy’s media ( McCoy 0 s 5a , 2mM Gluta - mine , and 10 % Fetal Bovine Serum FBS ) and changed every 2 – 3 days . At 70 – 80 % confluence ( passage 5 ) , they were rinsed with PBS , suspended using 0 . 05 % trypsin , incubated for 4 min - utes , pelleted by centrifuging at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes , resuspended in a fresh medium using a tube shaker for twenty seconds . The cells are then seeded into neutralized collagen I hydro - gels at a concentration ( 1 . 5 × 10 6 cells / ml ) a couple of minutes before hydrogel casting into the PDMS molds . On average , 250 – 350 cells per organoid were achieved . Adult Human Dermal Fibroblasts ( HDF ) ( HDF - 1N55 + , Cascade Biologics , Portland , OR , USA ) were used for viability tests at 80 – 90 % confluence ( passage 14 ) in a cell culture medium including ( Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium DMEM , 1 % GlutaMAX , 1 % Sodium Pyruvate , 10 % Fetal Bovine Serum FBS , 1 % penicillin - streptomycin ( 10 , 000 U / mL ) ) . Cells were rinsed with PBS , suspended using 0 . 25 % trypsin , incubated for three minutes , pelleted for 5 minutes using a centrifuge at 1200 rpm , resuspended in a fresh medium using a tube shaker for twenty seconds , and seeded on the 24 well plates with media change every 2 – 3 days for 3 weeks . ( PBS , DMEM , GlutaMAX , Sodium Pyruvate , FBS , penicillin - streptomycin , trypsin , McCoy 0 s 5a , and Glutamine were sourced from gibco , via Thermo Fisher , Waltham , MA , USA ) . 2 . 2 . 4 Cell viability . To evaluate the systems’ biocompatibility without 3D cell culture effects such as necrosis and hypoxia , 2D monolayers of human dermal fibroblasts were cul - tured in 24 well - plates with the PDMS manipulators , starting at low seeding numbers and achieving high numbers over time . Our previous publication [ 28 ] tested PDMS characteristics under a cell culture condition and demonstrated biocompatibility using the human dermal fibroblast cell line . This study used the same cell line to compare with the previous well - tested PDMS device design and use the results as a reference . After three weeks of culture , cells were rinsed with PBS and stained with live / dead assay solution at room temperature for 30 min and NucBlue ( DAPI ) for nuclei staining ( L3224 , R37606 , Invitrogen , Thermo Fisher , Waltham , MA , USA ) , respectively . The viability and nuclei of cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope ( Olympus BX51 , Olympus Corporation of the Americas , Center Valley , PA , USA ) to show the systems’ biocompatibility in the closed chamber version . The PDMS device was highly biocompatible , and we did not observe dead cells in this testing ( Fig 5 ) . Fig 5 .

Force sensing , displacement measurement , & analysis approach 2 . 3 . 1 Force sensing . The μ Tweezers testing approach relies on the cantilever deflections ; the differences of cantilever deflections with or without samples give the sample indentation and the cantilever bending ( Fig 6 ) . The sample indentation is tared at the sample contact point ( Fig 6A ) . The data was recorded up to a targeted strain limit during indentation to ensure the measurements were in the linear range . In this study , 4 % of the diameter was applied as the strain cut - off limit . The approach used in this study follows the steps as follows : 1 . The measurement starts once the end effector touches the sample ( i . e . , the parameters are tared at the sample - end effector contact point ) . 2 . With a sample , images were taken after each step in a quasi - static manner , which provided tiles of images displaying the displacements of the cantilevers’ deflections ( dc ) indenting the samples by ( ds ) . 3 . Without a sample , the same process was repeated but without a load ( force = 0 ) to have ref - erence displacement ( dref ) profiles of the cantilevers . Fig 6 .

Ideally , the cantilever alignment and bending are symmetric ( θ 1 = θ 2 , dc 1 = dc 2 = Dc ) , and the cantilever spring constants are the same ( kc 1 = kc 2 = Kc ) , which results in ( f 1 = f 2 = f ) . We found the force ( f ) by using the averaged cantilever bending Dc ¼ dc 1 þ dc 2 2 . We also assume the same cantilever orientation θ from start to stop ( 5 . 28˚ - 5 . 43˚ ) , which is adequate because ( cos ( 5 . 28˚ ) = 0 . 9957 , and cos ( 5 . 43˚ ) = 0 . 9955 ) , respectively . Thus , the force ( f ) was now simplified to : f cos ð y Þ ¼ Kc Dc ð 7 Þ Following every sample , a reference run recorded the displacements between the cantilevers without a sample ( dref ) , which was used to calculate the sample indentation ( ds ) where : dref ¼ dc þ ds ð 8 Þ Given that the sample indentation data was used only in the linear range , and the measure - ments conducted were in a quasi - static manner , it is safe to assume that the sample acts as a linear spring having a spring constant ( Ks ) . f ¼ Ds Ks ð 9 Þ Using the force from Eq ( 7 ) and the averaged sample indentation Ds ¼ ds 1 þ ds 2 2 , Eq ( 9 ) gives the sample stiffness or spring constant ( Ks ) as : Ks ¼ f Ds ¼ kc Dc Ds cos y ð 10 Þ 2 . 3 . 2 Cantilever - sample indentation measurement . After the actuator – manipulator ini - tial contact ( discussed previously in Fig 2H ) , a sample is placed between the cantilevers . As the cantilevers approach the sample , the displacements profiles are tracked through micro - scopic imaging . Another crucial point is the contact between the cantilevers and the sample , which must be carefully considered and monitored for accurate displacement measurements ( see Fig 7 ) . 2 . 3 . 3 Image tracking and data extraction . The scale ( pixel / μ m ) of the microscope images was obtained using ImageJ and an optical scale . Custom - programmed MATLAB codes were used to track the end - effector displacements , with a sample ( dc ) or without a sample ( dref ) , by tracking the displacement pixels of an area of interest through the image tiles of compression steps . The sample indentation ( ds ) was calculated as the difference between the contact point and the current position Eq ( 8 ) . Using the same manipulator and end - effectors for consecutive measurements did not affect the accuracy as every measurement was directly followed by a ref - erence measurement ( with no sample ) . 2 . 3 . 4 Parallel plate compression ( PPC ) , mechanical testing ( reference testing ) . To find the reference elastic modulus , we tested the same hydrogel group ( Control at day 0 , n = 4 ) using a typical parallel plate compression ( PPC ) at strain 4 % in a quasi - static manner at the PLOS ONE Biocompatible micro tweezers for 3D hydrogelorganoidarray mechanical characterization PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0262950 January 24 , 2022 12 / 20 same strain rate used in the tweezers setup ( 1 . 25 μ m / sec ) . The elastic modulus of the hydrogel discs was obtained using a hydrogel pillar with dimensions of ( radius = 5 mm and height = 2 mm ) and the simple linear cylinder compression formula : F A ¼ E � d L ð 11 Þ where ( A ) is the cylinder cross - sectional area A = πr 2 , ( E ) is Young’s modulus , and d L is the compression length . As the elastic modulus or Young’s modulus ( E ) is a material property and not a dimension property , the measured Young’s modulus ( E ) of the group ( Control at day 0 ) was applied to the same group using the micro tweezers . The other groups’ elastic moduli were calculated relative to this reference value based on the hydrogel measured stiffness or spring constant ( Ks ) . 2 . 4 Statistical analysis ANOVA and student t - tests were used for the statistical data analysis where data is reported as average ± standard deviation unless otherwise stated . The number of samples and linearity fit - ting ( R 2 ) are included when applicable . p - values of less than 0 . 05 ( p - value < 0 . 05 ) were consid - ered statistically significant and assigned ( � ) . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Organoids’ stiffnesses The stiffness of the hydrogel - based organoids was measured for four groups using the micro tweezers , namely , Control at day 0 , ovarian cancer cells SKOV3 at day 0 , Control at day 5 , and SKOV3 at day 5 ( Fig 8 ) . The results show significant increases in stiffness from day 0 to day 5 in both Control and ovarian cancer embedded organoids ( Fig 9 ) . Moreover , when comparing the stiffness of controls to the stiffness of cell embedded organoids , both at day 0 and day 5 , Fig 7 . Finding the cantilever - sample contact and measuring the following indentation . Once the cantilevers engage with the sample , a change in the slope is observed and recorded . In this measurement , Step 3 ( Taring point shown in green ) was the sample contact point where the displacement measurement started . Step 20 ( red ) was the cut - off strain limit considering the end - effectors’ calibration linear range and the targeted strain applied to samples . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0262950 . g007 PLOS ONE Biocompatible micro tweezers for 3D hydrogelorganoidarray mechanical characterization PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0262950 January 24 , 2022 13 / 20 significantly lower stiffnesses for groups with embedded cells were measured . The diameter changes across groups are explained in the following sections . 3 . 2 . Organoid diameter shrinkage The designed pillar diameters were fixed at 750 μ m ; however , the initial reference group ( con - trol—day 0 ) had a ( ~ 5 . 85 % ) reduction in diameter right after gelling because of the variation caused during manual fabrication and the shrinkage through hydrogel solidification ( polymer - ization / gelling ) . We also observed shrinkage through the five - day experiment . The observed results showed ( < 5 % ) reduction in diameter for groups ( SKOV3—day 0 ) and ( control—day 5 ) compared to the reference group ( Control—day 0 ) , while the last group ( SKOV3—day 5 ) had 9 . 1 % decrease in diameter indicating more cellular shrinkage over time . SKOV3 cells in the hydrogel - based organoids increased the shrinkage compared to the control group by ( 3 . 95 % ) on day 0 . The lowest reduction was between controls at days 0 and 5 ( 2 . 78 % ) , while Fig 8 .

A ( 6 . 32 % ) shrinkage in the group ( SKOV3—day 5 ) was attributed to the embedded ovarian cancer cells at day 5 , while the remaining shrinkage was due to the collagen shrinkage , as shown in control groups ( day 0 vs . day 5 ) . Collagen type I scaffolds exhibit contractility , while collagen type II was reported to mitigate or resist the contraction [ 34 ] . In this study , collagen type I hydrogel alone without collagen type II was used to form the organoids , which explains the contractil - ity of the control from day 0 to 5 . 3 . 3 . Young’s modulus estimation The Young’s modulus of the control group ( Control at day 0 ) was mechanically tested using typical PPC as described above . The elastic moduli of the other three groups were calculated relatively from the spring constant ( Fig 10 ) . According to the Hertz contact model of a cylinder and a parallel flat plate , the spring constant of the materials is not dependent on the curvature of the cylinder . The modulus of the group ( SKOV3 at day 5 ) fell in the same range of ( Control at day 0 ) based on the stiffness measurements . This trend is well observed in Fig 10B , where the collagen I organoid controls increased ( 29 . 83 % ) in the elastic moduli over five days ; simi - larly , the ovarian cancer cells ( SKOV3 ) embedded organoids increased ( 14 . 33 % ) in their elastic moduli . The trends observed also follow the reported literature where the cells change the elas - tic modulus of the surrounding matrix [ 35 ] . 4 . Discussion and conclusion The efficacy of the μ Tweezers system was demonstrated through the ease of fabrication and use . The actuator components and fabrication parameters can be further tuned to accommo - date other testing conditions and samples . The tuning of the manipulator and end - effectors through geometry change or curing conditions is easily achievable . Different sample structures and end - effector contact designs can be applied ; higher strains were achievable with careful considerations of the cantilevers’ calibration linear range , spring constant , and the applicable contact models . The samples used in this study were prepared in an identical cylindrical shape . One of the advantages of this approach is that we can assess relative stiffness by comparing the force curves . Our PDMS tweezers can also manipulate specimens with arbitrary shapes . Analytical contact mechanics models [ 36 , 37 ] or finite element method ( FEM ) models [ 24 , 27 ] can be used to evaluate the elastic modulus from the force curve . For spherical samples , a common approach is the use of contact mechanics models . Kosheleva et al . used the Hertz contact model to study tumor spheroids [ 38 ] . Irregularly shaped samples may be studied by an FEM model analysis . We have reported the use of a COMSOL ™ model to estimate the elasticity of zebrafish embryos [ 27 ] . Hertz contact mechanics has been applied for a low strain regime ( < 5 % ) [ 39 ] . Many rheology - based hydrogel testing is reported in the linear viscoelastic regime [ 19 ] . In this study , we applied a 4 % strain cut - off for all types of measurements and groups . The system’s fine features were tested and validated through the experiments . The μ Tweezers system was capable of the stiffness characterization and manipulation of micro - meso scaled hydrogel - based organoids . We measured the stiffness changes of collagen I hydrogel organoids in four conditions . The microdevice fits on / in standard tissue culture Petri dishes , allowing high throughput mechanical compression characterization of arrayed 3D organoid pillars . On average , 40 tests were conducted per hour ( 20 organoids / 20 references ) , including alignment time between samples . This mechanical testing productivity is signifi - cantly increased compared to typically available devices ( individual sample testing ) while sig - nificantly reducing the biomaterials and technology costs . The device is highly tunable for PLOS ONE Biocompatible micro tweezers for 3D hydrogelorganoidarray mechanical characterization PLOS ONE | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0262950 January 24 , 2022 16 / 20 different applications and operation ranges with maintained biocompatibility . Our group pre - viously studied 3D tumor spheroids [ 24 ] and more irregularly - shaped zebrafish embryos [ 27 ] using other versions of micro tweezers , where we used FEM models to evaluate the stiffness . Although the actuator we used in this study is different and much improved from the previous designs , the end effectors were made of PDMS , which was used also in [ 27 ] . We can use Fig 10 .

While the tweezer is capable of manipulating samples in the 50 μ m - 1500 μ m range The mea - surement accuracy depends on the indentation depth ds ( μ m ) needed for measurement and the manipulator repeatability ( μ m ) , . Since the image analysis showed the end effector’s posi - tioning repeatability to be 2 – 3 μ m ( see Fig 2H ) , an indentation depth larger than ~ 10 μ m is desirable . This indentation depth corresponds to a few hundred μ m or larger when we apply 5 % strain limit . The platform has shown excellent potential for complementing established mechanical characterization methods such as AFM and nanoindentation while targeting efficient and widely adopted micro - meso scaled 3D biological samples / models . Hydrogel stiffnesses were successfully measured in a high throughput manner with substantial valuable biomaterials reduction , using a typical inverted optical microscope . The system can significantly contribute to the biomedical , biomechanical , biological , biomaterials , and regenerative engineering fields . Acknowledgments Intellectual property U . S .
