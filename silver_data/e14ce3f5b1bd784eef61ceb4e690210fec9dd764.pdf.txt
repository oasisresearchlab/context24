The Effects of Helicobacter pylori Infection on Dendritic Cells by David Rizzuti A thesis submitted in conformity with the requirements for the degree of Master of Science Department of Physiology University of Toronto © Copyright by David Rizzuti ( 2012 ) ii The Effects of Helicobacter pylori Infection on Dendritic Cells David Rizzuti Master of Science Department of Physiology University of Toronto 2012 Abstract Helicobacter pylori infects the human gastric mucosa and induces a chronic gastritis that does not eliminate the pathogen . H . pylori infection is the primary risk factor for gastric cancer development . The host immune system is crucial for both bacterial elimination and tumor surveillance . The interaction between H . pylori and dendritic cells ( DC ) , key orchestrators of the host immune response , was examined . H . pylori activated the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) pathway , assayed using immunoblotting , in bone marrow - derived DCs . This blunted DC maturation , determined by CD86 and MHC II expression , in an autocrine / paracrine IL - 10 - dependent pathway . H . pylori infection stimulated the production of cytokines including IL - 10 , IL - 12p40 , and TNF - α as determined using ELISA and multiplex analysis . DC co - culture with T cells did not drive regulatory T cell development . These results demonstrate that H . pylori blunts DC maturation , which may play an important role in promoting bacterial persistence and disease . iii Acknowledgments There are many people that I would like to acknowledge for making this thesis possible .

shaped , Gram - negative bacterium that selectively infects the gastric mucosa of almost half of the human population ( Cover and Blaser , 2009 ; Kusters et al . , 2006 ) . Infection usually occurs early in childhood and colonization generally persists for the lifetime of the host . Infected individuals can develop several disease phenotypes , including simple gastritis , peptic ulcers , and gastric cancer ( Wroblewski et al . , 2010 ) . Indeed , H . pylori was recognized as a Type I carcinogen in 1994 and infection with this pathogen remains the primary risk factor for gastric cancer development ( Amieva and El - Omar , 2008 ; Kusters et al . , 2006 ; Peek and Crabtree , 2006 ; Uemura et al . , 2001 ) . H . pylori possess numerous adaptations that facilitate successful colonization of the human gastric epithelium . The generation of cytosolic and cell - surface urease permits transient survival in the highly acidic gastric lumen ( Amieva and El - Omar , 2008 ) . The urease enzyme functions to convert urea into NH 3 and CO 2 , which buffer the acidic environment of the gastric lumen . Several polar flagella and a spiral shape facilitate mobility of the bacteria in the highly motile gastric environment , which is constantly churning and secreting mucus . This mobility , combined with a chemotaxis receptor ( TlpB ) that detects extracellular pH , allows H . pylori to orient and remain close to the epithelial layer where the pH is almost neutral ( Amieva and El - Omar , 2008 ; Croxen et al . , 2006 ) . Several specialized adhesion molecules allow the bacteria to adhere to the epithelium and further facilitate colonization and persistence . The outer - membrane protein BabA binds to Lewis B blood group antigens which are expressed on gastric epithelial cells , while the adhesin SabA binds to sialyl - Lewis - X , a glycoprotein expressed on the epithelial cell surface ( Amieva and El - Omar , 2008 ; Linden et al . , 2002 ; Montecucco and Rappuoli , 2001 ) . H . pylori uses these diverse factors in concert to orient , localize , and adhere to the gastric epithelial surface , which facilitates the translocation of bacterial proteins into epithelial cells and grants the 2 bacteria access to cellular nutrients that are necessary for survival . This creates a remarkable niche that facilitates bacterial survival and contributes to life - long infection and persistence . 1 . 1 . 2 Disease Pathogenesis Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with three main disease phenotypes . All infected individuals will develop gastritis ( a chronic mild inflammation in the gastric mucosa ) ; 80 - 90 % of these individuals will remain asymptomatic and will not develop any serious gastrointestinal ( GI ) complications as a result of this H . pylori infection . This phenotype has therefore been termed the “simple gastritis phenotype” and is found in the overwhelming majority of infected individuals ( Amieva and El - Omar , 2008 ) . Approximately ten percent of individuals infected with H . pylori develop a “duodenal ulcer phenotype” characterized by an antral - predominant gastritis accompanied by high levels of acid secretion ( Cover and Blaser , 2009 ) . Patients with this phenotype , which is particularly prevalent in Western societies , are predisposed to the development of duodenal ulcers ( Kusters et al . , 2006 ) . Approximately 1 - 2 % of individuals infected with H . pylori will develop cancer , including gastric adenocarcinoma and mucosal - associated lymphoid tissues ( MALT ) lymphomas ( Wroblewski et al . , 2010 ) . These are associated with the third disease phenotype , known as the “gastric cancer phenotype” , which is characterized by decreased levels of acid production and a corpus - predominant gastritis ( El - Omar et al . , 1997 ) . The H . pylori - mediated chronic gastritis is thought to be the primary stage in the transformation from a normal gastric mucosa through a series of definite histological and functional stages which culminates in gastric adenocarcinoma , as proposed by Correa ( Correa , 1992 , 2004 ) ( Figure 1 . 1 - 2 ) . Briefly , the transformation begins with chronic gastritis that proceeds into atrophic gastritis and inflammatory destruction of the mucosa . Several factors , including H . pylori infection , inflammatory responses , dietary and lifestyle habits , and genetic susceptibility , are thought to contribute to this progression . Intestinal metaplasia followed by dysplasia and finally transformation to adenocarcinoma are the later stages of this transformation ( Correa and Houghton , 2007 ) . However the exact mechanisms of H . pylori - mediated carcinogenesis have yet to be fully elucidated , and bacterial , host , and environmental factors appear to play complex and often synergistic roles in mediating the cancer risk associated with H . pylori infection ( Amieva and El - Omar , 2008 ) . The goal of this study is not to directly examine the carcinogenic potential of H . pylori , rather to examine the interaction 3 between H . pylori and the host immune response . Subversion or modulation of the host immune response may play an important role in bacterial persistence and simultaneously contribute to disease pathogenesis by inhibiting immune responses to developing cancerous cells . 4 Figure 1 . 1 - 1 : Gastric cancer model as proposed by Correa H . pylori infection induces chronic gastritis in the mucosa . This inflammation , combined with environmental and host genetic factors , induces atrophy of the gastric mucosa and loss of glandular tissue . Low acidity can then contribute to the development of intestinal and colonic metaplasia , followed by dysplasia and finally transformation into adenocarcinoma . 5 1 . 1 . 3 Virulence Factors Pathogenesis of H . pylori strains vary considerably largely due to variations in two major bacterial factors : the cytotoxin - associated gene A ( CagA ) toxin , an injected protein that is encoded by the cag pathogenicity island ( cag PAI ) , and the vacuolating - cytotoxin A ( VacA ) , which is toxin is secreted by the bacteria and induces the formation of large vacuoles in cultured epithelial cells ( Akopyants et al . , 1998 ; Terebiznik et al . , 2006 ) . The molecular and cellular mechanisms of action of these two major H . pylori virulence factors have garnered much attention and are described below . 1 . 1 . 3 . 1 cag PAI and CagA The cag PAI is a 40 - kb deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) sequence in the H . pylori genome that contains approximately 27 to 31 genes , the majority of which ( at least 18 ) code for a bacterial type IV secretion system ( T4SS ) . This T4SS acts as a “molecular syringe” to transfer the bacterial effector protein CagA into the host cell cytoplasm ( Akopyants et al . , 1998 ; Odenbreit et al . , 2000 ) . CagA is a 120 - 140kDa protein , encoded by the cagA gene ; CagA + strains of H . pylori confer a much higher risk for the development of gastric cancer to their hosts ( Parsonnet et al . , 1997 ; Robinson et al . , 2007 ) . Once CagA is injected into the host cell , it localizes near the plasma membrane , and becomes phosphorylated via host c - Src and Abl family kinases ( Amieva and El - Omar , 2008 ; Selbach et al . , 2002 ; Tammer et al . , 2007 ) ( Figure 1 . 1 - 3 ) . The phosphorylation occurs on the tyrosine residue of glutamate - proline - isoleucine - tyrosine - alanine ( EPIYA ) motifs , which are located near the C - terminus of the CagA protein ( Naito et al . , 2006 ) . Upon phosphorylation of the EPIYA motifs , the CagA protein will interact with multiple intracellular effector molecules . Phosphorylated CagA ( P - CagA ) interacts with the tyrosine phosphatase SHP - 2 , inducing activation of the extracellular signal - regulated kinases 1 and 2 ( ERK 1 / 2 ) , which culminates in morphological changes such as cell migration , elongation , and scattering , collectively known as the “hummingbird phenotype” ( Moese et al . , 2004 ; Robinson et al . , 2007 ; Yamazaki et al . , 2003 ) . 6 Figure 1 . 1 - 2 : CagA signaling pathways H . pylori uses the cag PAI - encoded T4SS to inject CagA into the host cell . Injected CagA has the potential to localize near the plasma membrane and become phosphorylated by SRC or ABL family kinases on EPIYA motifs . Phosporylated CagA can bind SHP - 2 , activating ERK signaling pathways that result in the production of the “hummingbird phenotype” in epithelial cells . Unphosphorylated CagA also has the potential to interact with cell signaling proteins such as c - Met and Grb2 , and junctional proteins such as ZO - 1 and JAM - A to alter tight junctions . 7 CagA has also been shown to exert phosphorylation - independent effects , where the N - terminus targets the protein to epithelial cell junctions ( Bagnoli et al . , 2005 ) . Unphosphorylated CagA forms induce profound effects on the apical junctional complex , interacting with multiple cellular proteins , including c - Met , E - cadherin , and Grb2 . This results in mitogenic and proinflammatory responses , ablation of cell polarity , disruption of adherens junctions , and activation of matrix metalloproteases , which induces epithelial cell invasiveness ( Amieva et al . , 2003 ; Oliveira et al . , 2006 ; Wroblewski et al . , 2010 ) . Unphosporylated CagA can also alter the epithelial cell tight junction , interacting with the junctional adhesion molecule A ( JAM - A ) and zonula occludens 1 ( ZO - 1 ) to alter the development of tight junctions . In addition , our lab has shown that CagA activates the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 in a phosphorylation independent manner ( Bronte - Tinkew et al . , 2009 ) . Collectively , these studies show that phosphorylation of CagA is not a requirement for induction of epithelial cell changes . H . pylori CagA + strains are associated with higher incidences of gastric cancer ( Blaser et al . , 1995 ; Wu et al . , 2003 ) , peptic ulcers ( Nomura et al . , 2002 ) , metaplasia , and inflammation ( Amieva and El - Omar , 2008 ; Brandt et al . , 2005 ; Wirth et al . , 1998 ) than CagA - strains . As described above , CagA has the ability to induce profound morphological changes and increase cell proliferation ( Peek et al . , 1997 ) , and the potential to interfere with numerous cell functions and pathways . The specific molecular mode of action of CagA in the colonization of the human stomach , however , remains to be determined . Studies have found phosphorylated CagA in gastric biopsies from infected individuals , indicating that it is indeed injected into the cell and phosphorylated ( Yamazaki et al . , 2003 ) . It is not currently known which pathways described above are actually activated in human H . pylori infection ; indeed , although CagA can induce phosphorylation - independent effects in cultured epithelial cells , the presence of unphosphorylated CagA has not yet been demonstrated within host cells . Additionally , the host cells and proteins that are the actual targets of CagA insertion have not been delineated , and the advantages gained by the bacteria from CagA insertion are ambiguous . The mechanisms by which CagA induces carcinogenesis have not been fully elucidated ; while animal models and cell culture experiments have uncovered potential oncogenic molecular pathways and epidemiological studies have linked CagA unequivocally with increased cancer risk , many questions remain unanswered . Studies often produce conflicting data , owing to different experimental techniques , strains , and models . While transgenic mice expressing CagA develop 8 carcinomas ( Ohnishi et al . , 2008 ) , this occurred without an inflammatory reaction ; in human H . pylori infection as well as Mongolian gerbil models ( Shibata et al . , 2006 ) , CagA is associated with increased inflammation , and this effect is associated with the development of cancer . Further confounding all of these issues is the fact that the vast majority of patients infected with CagA + strains of H . pylori remain cancer - free and asymptomatic . Clearly much remains to be discovered about CagA , its targets and mechanisms of action , and the factors that contribute to CagA - associated disease progression in H . pylori - infected patients . 1 . 1 . 3 . 2 VacA The second major H . pylori virulence factor is the vacuolating cytotoxin A ( VacA ) – an 88 - kDa secreted toxin that was initially found in vitro to induce the production of large vacuoles in epithelial cells ( Leunk et al . , 1988 ) . The presence of VacA has also been associated with an increased risk for H . pylori - induced carcinogenesis ( Robinson et al . , 2007 ) VacA is encoded by the vacA gene , and genetic diversity in this gene among strains results in variations in phenotype , cancer risk , and toxic effects ( Amieva and El - Omar , 2008 ; de Sablet et al . , 2011 ) . The secreted VacA protein can be disassociated into p33 N - terminal and p55 C - terminal subunits upon exposure to either basic or acidic conditions ( Cover and Blanke , 2005 ) , but assembly into a large ( 6 - or 7 - subunit ) oligomeric complex is necessary for the formation of an anion - selective membrane channel which is crucial for the biological activity of VacA ( Dhar et al . , 2003 ) . The VacA membrane channel increases transcellular permeability and releases anions , urea , bicarbonate , and other nutrients from the cell cytosol to support bacterial growth ( Montecucco and de Bernard , 2003 ) . The complex is endocytosed into GPI - AP - enriched early endosomal compartments ( GEECs ) . Here the anion channel conducts chloride ions into the endosome ( Gauthier et al . , 2007 ) resulting in osmotic swelling of the compartment , inducing the large characteristic vacuoles . In addition to the induction of vacuoles , VacA can induce multiple effects on different host cell types . The p33 subunit targets the cellular mitochondria , forms pores in the inner membrane and changes the inner membrane potential , and induces apoptosis ( programmed cell death ) ( Cover and Blanke , 2005 ; Cover et al . , 2003 ; Galmiche et al . , 2000 ) . VacA induces the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria , resulting in the activation of caspase 3 , culminating in the induction of apoptosis ( Galmiche et al . , 2000 ; Willhite and Blanke , 2004 ; Yamasaki et al . , 2006 ) . 9 A novel mechanism of VacA - induced apoptosis has been demonstrated , whereby the toxin fragments the mitochondrial network via recruitment of dynamin - related protein 1 ( Jain et al . , 2011 ) . This activates the Bcl - 2 - associated X protein , resulting in apoptosis . VacA has also been recently shown to induce autophagy in gastric epithelial cells ( Terebiznik et al . , 2009 ) . Autophagy is an important cellular mechanism that plays a role in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis as well as innate immunity ( Raju and Jones , 2010 ) . VacA has the potential to modulate the host immune system by interacting with several types of immune cells , including CD4 + T cells . VacA can inhibit T cell proliferation , activation , and antigen presentation , thus suppressing T - cell - mediated immunity ( Basso et al . , 2008 ; Boncristiano et al . , 2003 ; Gebert et al . , 2003 ) . A recent study implicated the protein kinase C family in uptake of VacA into T cells ( Sewald et al . , 2011 ) . VacA has also been shown to bind CD18 ( the β2 integrin subunit ) on T cells and cause cellular vacuolization using the lymphocyte function - associated antigen ( LFA - 1 ) ( Sewald et al . , 2008 ) . VacA also affects immune antigen - presenting cells ( APCs ) , inhibiting Ii - dependent antigen presentation ( Boncristiano et al . , 2003 ; Molinari et al . , 1998 ) . Furthermore it has been shown to inhibit B cell activation and proliferation , and induce B cell apoptosis ( Singh et al . , 2006 ; Torres et al . , 2007 ) . VacA can also exert proinflammatory effects , inducing release of TNF - α and IL - 6 release from mast cells ( Cover and Blanke , 2005 ) . Clearly VacA is a multifunctional toxin that can exert profound effects on the host immune response . VacA induces multiple responses from diverse host cell types in vitro ; although the precise actions of VacA in vivo remain to be elucidated . 1 . 1 . 3 . 3 Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) is a structural component of the cell wall found in Gram - negative bacteria such as H . pylori and E . coli that typically induces a strong inflammatory response . LPS is recognized by the innate immune receptor TLR4 to induce production of proinflammatory cytokines ( Lu et al . , 2008 ) . However H . pylori LPS does not induce inflammatory responses in epithelial cells , even at high concentrations , and may not be recognized by host TLR4 ( Backhed et al . , 2003 ) . Furthermore H . pylori LPS has been shown to possess 10 3 times less endotoxin activity as compared to LPS from other Gram - negative bacteria such as E . coli ( Cunningham et al . , 1996 ; Perez - Perez et al . , 1995 ) . It has also been shown to bind trefoil factor 1 in the gastric mucosa to potentially promote colonization ( Reeves et al . , 2008 ) . Therefore the low 10 immunogenicity of H . pylori LPS represents a potential mechanism by which the pathogen is able to evade the host immune response . 1 . 2 The Immune Response Chronic gastritis is a hallmark of H . pylori infection . Despite the presence of this low - level inflammatory response , the infection persists for the lifetime of the host , which suggests that H . pylori is able to evade or subvert the host immune response . The causative role that H . pylori infection plays in the development of gastric cancer further emphasizes the bacteria’s potential immune - moderating effects , as a lack of tumor immunosurveillance during infection may be involved ( Strioga et al . , 2012 ) . Therefore , the interaction between the bacterium and the host immune response is an area of intense research interest . The host immune response is composed of several components , including the innate immune response and the adaptive immune response . The innate response is a rapid , generalized response to distinct molecular patterns that are conserved among microorganisms ( Murphy et al . , 2012 ) . These patterns are known as Pathogen - Associated Molecular Patterns ( PAMPs ) , and innate immunity uses Pattern Recognition Receptors ( PRRs ) to recognize these PAMPs ( Murphy et al . , 2012 ) . These PRRs include the Toll - like Receptor ( TLR ) family , a group of receptors that recognize components such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide or unmethylated DNA in extracellular and endosomal compartments ( Rad et al . , 2009 ) . Nod - like receptors ( NLRs ) are a more recently - discovered type of PRR that recognize PAMPs in intracellular compartments such as the cytosol ; these include Nod1 and Nod2 which recognize a component of the bacterial cell wall , peptidoglycan ( Fritz et al . , 2007 ; Girardin et al . , 2003 ) . These PAMPs are often highly conserved among microorganisms and are not found in the normal host ; therefore these PRRs provide the host immune system with a quick and generalized way of discriminating “self” vs . “non - self” ( Murphy et al . , 2012 ) . The adaptive immune response is a precise and targeted response to specific antigens . This adaptive response includes the recruitment , activation , and proliferation of different classes of immune cells , and thus is more delayed than the innate immune response ( Murphy et al . , 2012 ) . Briefly , antigen - presenting cells ( APCs ) utilize innate PRRs and other receptors to detect foreign bodies , invaders , and Danger - Associated Molecular Patterns ( DAMPs ) such as cytokines and peptides released from apoptotic , necrotic , or tumor cells ( Murphy et al . , 2012 ) . These APCs , 11 which include immune cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells ( DCs ) , are the sentinels of the immune system ; once they detect something awry in the extracellular environment they activate the suitable effector cells of the immune system ( including T cells and B cells ) to deal with it appropriately ( Murphy et al . , 2012 ) . Dendritic cells are particularly specialized APCs ; they express the broadest repertoire of PRRs and are capable of inducing powerful effector immune responses to antigens as well as immunoregulatory and tolerant responses to self - peptides and commensal organisms ( Rad et al . , 2009 ) . Thus DCs are key moderators of the adaptive immune response and represent an ideal target for H . pylori ’s immune - modulating effects . This thesis is focused on the interaction between H . pylori and this decisive immune cell . 1 . 2 . 1 The Dendritic Cell As dendritic cells are the most potent APCs in the host immune system , their primary role is to initiate adaptive immune responses by detecting , processing , and presenting antigens to T cells in order to activate these effector cells appropriately ( Lenahan and Avigan , 2006 ; Murphy et al . , 2012 ) . DCs express high levels of the type I transmembrane protein CD11c , making it a suitable marker for DC detection . Immature dendritic cells are found throughout the body at the sites of antigen capture such as the gastric lamina propria . DCs use PRRs and processes such as phagocytosis , macropinocytosis , and membrane ruffling to constantly sample the extracellular environment , vigilantly searching for antigenic material ( Murphy et al . , 2012 ) . Upon encounter with an antigen , DCs internalize the antigen and undergo a maturation process to present peptides of the antigen to T cells . The DCs enlarge , grow characteristic dendrites , and migrate to draining lymph nodes , where the population of naïve T cells awaits their antigen presentation . Within the DC , antigens are internalized into endosomes that fuse with lysosomes to degrade the contents into antigenic peptides . The peptides are loaded onto Major Histocompatibility Complex ( MHC ) molecules and the MHC - peptide complex is transported to the cell surface . The MHC class I complex can then synapse with a T Cell Receptor ( TCR ) combined with a CD8 molecule on the surface of a CD8 + Cytotoxic T cell ( Tc ) , while the MHC class II complex synapses with a TCR combined with a CD4 molecule on the surface of a CD4 + Helper T cell ( Th ) ( Murphy et al . , 2012 ) . This MHC II - TCR interaction is the first signal needed for the DC to activate the naïve Th cell , and the TCR must recognize the specific antigen loaded onto the MHC II complex . The second signal is accomplished when the DC costimulatory complex of CD80 / 86 12 and CD40 contacts the CD28 and CD40L receptors on the T cell . Together these interactions form the immunological synapse ( Figure 1 . 2 - 1 ) . In order to achieve these appropriate interactions , part of the DC maturation process involves the upregulation of CD40 , CD80 , and CD86 expression on the cell surface . Thus immature DCs express low levels of cell surface MHC II and CD40 / 80 / 86 , and increase expression of these molecules upon maturation . When the DC presents the MHC II - antigen complex as well as the costimulatory complex to the CD4 + T cell with the appropriate TCR , it activates the T cell and induces its proliferation , producing an army of effector cells that will specifically target the antigen that was presented by the DC ( Murphy et al . , 2012 ) . In addition to their role in activating immune responses to pathogenic microorganisms , DCs also play a very important role in tumor surveillance ( Steinman and Banchereau , 2007 ) . DCs recognize tumor associated antigens and mature in the tumor microenvironment ( Lin et al . , 2010 ) . DCs have the ability to induce immune responses towards these tumor associated antigens , activating T cells to target tumor cells ( Lin et al . , 2010 ) . Therefore dendritic cells play a key role in immune surveillance , as they alert the immune system to danger signals from foreign invaders as well as native cells that have been transformed into malignant problems . DCs activate appropriate immune responses to deal with the threat accordingly . 13 Figure 1 . 2 - 1 : The immunological synapse After encounter with an antigen , the DC undertakes a maturation process to present the antigenic peptides on its cell surface in the context of MHC II to the TCR of a naïve CD4 + T cell ( Signal 1 ) . The DC also upregulates surface expression of the CD40 / 80 / 86 costimulatory complex , which binds to the appropriate receptors ( CD28 and CD40L ) on the T cell ( Signal 2 ) . This induces activation and proliferation of the T cell , commencing the adaptive immune response . 14 1 . 2 . 2 T Cell Phenotypes DCs are not only important activators of the adaptive immune response ; they also moderate immune responses by dictating the phenotype of T cell that develops upon activation . As described above , DCs can present antigen in the context of the MHC class I molecule to CD8 + cytotoxic T cells , priming them to proliferate and recognize virally infected cells ( Murphy et al . , 2012 ) . DCs also present antigen in the context of MHC class II molecules to naïve CD4 + helper T cells , and it is through these CD4 + T cells that the DC’s true immunomodulating potential is revealed . Different types of cytokines are released by DCs depending upon the type and context of the antigen that the DC encounters . This cytokine secretion is the third signal that DCs provide to the T cell to stimulate proliferation , differentiation , and initiation of adaptive T cell responses . These cytokines will drive the development of different CD4 + T cell phenotypes , each of which produces a different adaptive immune response ( Figure 1 . 2 - 2 ) . 15 Figure 1 . 2 - 2 : T cell differentiation The mature dendritic cell will secrete different cytokines to produce various CD4 + T cell phenotypes . IL - 12 drives the production of Th1 cells , which produce IFN - γ and activate macrophages to eliminate virally infected cells . IL - 4 appears to drive Th2 development , which secrete more IL - 4 and activate B cells to produce antibodies targeting extracellular pathogens such as bacteria . IL - 6 with IL - 23 and TGF - β drive Th17 development ; Th17 cells secrete the inflammatory cytokine IL - 17 and are found at the interfaces between the external and internal environment such as the GI tract and the skin . The secretion of TGF - β and IL - 10 drive Treg development , while IL - 2 is important for proliferation . Tregs secrete IL - 10 and TGF - β , which are immunosuppressive cytokines that inhibit activity of immune cells . 16 DCs can induce different inflammatory immune responses , which are dependent on the type of cytokines secreted , to deal with pathogenic microorganisms and antigens , or they can induce tolerogenic responses to prevent immune reactions to commensal bacteria and self - peptides . The release of the cytokine interleukin - 12 ( IL - 12 ) from the DC with appropriate antigen and costimulatory presentation will drive the development of type 1 helper T cells ( Th1 ) and the cellular immune response ( Murphy et al . , 2012 ) . Th1 cells secrete the cytokine interferon - gamma ( IFN - γ ) and activate macrophages and cytotoxic T cells to kill virally infected cells ( Murphy et al . , 2012 ) . The cellular immune response is adept at dealing with intracellular pathogens such as viruses . The cytokine IL - 4 is crucial for the development of the Th2 helper T cell phenotype , which drives the humoral immune response . Th2 cells activate B cells to secrete antibodies ; these antibodies bind to extracellular pathogens such as bacteria and activate the complement system to kill the invading microorganism ( Murphy et al . , 2012 ) . The release of the cytokines IL - 6 , IL - 23 , and transforming growth factor beta ( TGF - β ) from the DC stimulates the transcription factor RORγt in the naïve T cells and drives the Th17 helper T cell phenotype ( Dong , 2008 ; Manel et al . , 2008 ) . Th17 cells are proinflammatory and are found at the interfaces between the external and internal environment , such as the lining of the GI tract and the skin . They secrete the inflammatory cytokine IL - 17 , and recruit inflammatory immune cells such as neutrophils to deal with extracellular pathogens such as bacteria and fungi ( Ivanov et al . , 2006 ) . Excessive activity of Th17 cells appears to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of multiple inflammatory and immune - mediated diseases , including inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , rheumatoid arthritis , and asthma ( Tesmer et al . , 2008 ) . Additionally DCs can drive development of an inducible regulatory T cell ( Treg ) phenotype to prevent immune reactivity to auto - antigens and commensal bacteria . Treg development is regulated by the forkhead transcription factor FoxP3 . Tregs express FoxP3 in their nucleus and CD25 on the cell surface ( Chen et al . , 2003 ) . The exact cytokine profile driving Treg development has not been fully elucidated , but the release of TGF - β as well as IL - 10 from the DC appears to be required ( Chaudhry et al . , 2011 ; Fu et al . , 2004 ; Lan et al . , 2006 ) ; while IL - 2 ( Malek , 2003 ) and more recently IL - 18 ( Oertli et al . , 2012 ) have been implicated in Treg proliferation and skewing . Tregs are immunoregulatory T cells that inhibit the proliferation , activation , and activity of other immune cells including APCs and effector T cells , effectively suppressing the immune response by contact - dependent and contact - independent mechanisms 17 ( Curotto de Lafaille and Lafaille , 2009 ) . These inducible Tregs produce immunosuppressive cytokines such as TGF - β and IL - 10 to inhibit immune cells ( Corthay , 2009 ; O ' Garra et al . , 2004 ) . IL - 10 particularly has potent immunoregulatory effects , blocking the maturation of DCs and inhibiting the antigen - presenting functions of other APCs ( Corinti et al . , 2001 ; Enk et al . , 1993 ) . Thus inducible Tregs can effectively suppress the immune response by inhibiting other immune cells . Tregs play important roles in preventing autoimmune disease and shutting down the immune response after the offending organism has been successfully eliminated ( Mills and McGuirk , 2004 ) . This ability to drive the differentiation of multiple distinct T cell phenotypes , each of which produces a vastly different immune response , makes dendritic cells key orchestrators of the immune system . DCs have the ability to profoundly modulate the immune response , initiating both powerful effector responses towards threats ( such as pathogens and tumor cells ) and tolerant regulatory responses towards self - peptides and commensal organisms . 1 . 2 . 3 Dendritic Cell Responses to H . pylori H . pylori has the ability to evade or subvert the host immune response , inducing a chronic gastritis that is insufficient to eliminate the pathogen and potentially inhibiting immune tumor surveillance to play a causative role in the development of gastric cancer . As dendritic cells are key modulators of the immune response , they are ideal targets for H . pylori ’s immune - manipulating effects . Dendritic cells are present in the gastric mucosa of H . pylori - infected individuals , residing in the lamina propria just beneath the epithelial cell layer ( Kao et al . , 2006 ) . DCs extend long dendritic projects through epithelial - apical junctions in order to directly take up bacteria ( Necchi et al . , 2009 ) ( Figure 1 . 2 - 3 ) . Furthermore H . pylori can be found in the lamina propria as well as inside vacuoles in gastric epithelial cells ( Dubois and Boren , 2007 ; Necchi et al . , 2007 ; Terebiznik et al . , 2006 ) thus allowing exposure to DCs . Several studies have begun to assess the effects of H . pylori on dendritic cell maturation , activation , and induction of T cell responses . However these limited studies to date have produced conflicting results . 18 Figure 1 . 2 - 3 : Potential dendritic cell - H . pylori interactions H . pylori has the potential to interact with the host DC in multiple ways , and DCs have been shown to drive differing T cell responses upon H . pylori infection or stimulation . 19 A study by Rad et al . found that H . pylori lysates induced maturation of murine bone marrow - derived dendritic cells ( BMDCs ) as determined by MHC class II , CD80 , and CD86 upregulation ( Rad et al . , 2007 ) . The BMDCs secreted IL - 12 and IL - 10 in response to the H . pylori lysates . A later study by Rad et al . also implicated specific PRRs , including TLR2 , TLR4 , and TLR9 , in the DC recognition of H . pylori ( Rad et al . , 2009 ) . Kranzer et al . found that H . pylori induced maturation of human DCs as measured by upregulation of CD80 , CD83 , CD86 , and MHC II surface expression ( Kranzer et al . , 2004 ) . H . pylori also induced production of IL - 6 , IL - 8 , IL - 10 , and IL - 12 in the DCs ( Kranzer et al . , 2004 ) . Importantly , in this study these effects were similar to the effects of stimulating the DCs with lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) from Escherichia coli ( E . coli ) bacteria , a potent activator of DC maturation ( Kranzer et al . , 2004 ) . The H . pylori - stimulated DCs produced less IL - 12 than the LPS - stimulated DCs , although the functional effect on T cell phenotype was not examined . In further studies , this group showed that the virulence factors cag PAI and VacA were not required for H . pylori - induced DC maturation , activation , and DC - mediated T cell activation ( Kranzer et al . , 2005 ) . Guiney et al . utilized DCs derived from human peripheral blood monocytes and found that H . pylori induced secretion of IL - 12 with no production of IL - 10 ( Guiney et al . , 2003 ) . The authors suggest that this would polarize a Th1 phenotype , although no functional assays were conducted . Interestingly , in this study the H . pylori - stimulated DCs produced less IL - 12 than DCs stimulated with another bacteria , Salmonella enterica ( Guiney et al . , 2003 ) . A comprehensive study by Bimczok et al . found increased numbers of DCs in H . pylori - infected patients as compared to uninfected controls ( Bimczok et al . , 2010 ) . The DCs from H . pylori - infected patients also had increased surface expression of the MHC II component HLA - DR , as well as the maturation markers CD83 and CD86 ( Bimczok et al . , 2010 ) . This study also examined the effect of H . pylori infection on gastric DCs isolated from uninfected control subjects , as well as peripheral monocyte - derived DCs . In this study H . pylori induced maturation of the gastric DCs and the monocyte - derived DCs , as assessed by upregulation of CD80 , CD83 , CD86 , and CD11c cell surface expression ( Bimczok et al . , 2010 ) . Interestingly , H . pylori induced the gastric DCs to secrete IL - 6 , IL - 8 , and IL - 10 , but did not induce secretion of IL - 12 ( Bimczok et al . , 2010 ) . Despite the lack of secretion of this important Th1 - stimulating cytokine , 20 the H . pylori - pulsed gastric DCs induced T cells to secrete IFN - γ , which is consistent with Th1 responses . Therefore the authors concluded that H . pylori activates human gastric DCs to induce a predominant Th1 response ( Bimczok et al . , 2010 ) . Another study utilizing human monocyte - derived dendritic cells found that H . pylori upregulated expression of the maturation markers CD40 , CD80 , CD86 , and the MHC II in DCs ( Chang et al . , 2012 ) . This study demonstrated that H . pylori induced secretion of IL - 10 and TNF - α from these DCs , and specific PRRs such as TLR2 and TLR4 were implicated in this secretion ( Chang et al . , 2012 ) . Interestingly , the authors found that monocyte - derived DCs that were produced from gastric cancer patients did not secrete IL - 10 in response to H . pylori stimulation , and speculated that this defective IL - 10 response contributes to the gastric cancer seen in H . pylori patients ( Chang et al . , 2012 ) . Kao et al . found that H . pylori induced secretion of IL - 12 and IL - 10 from murine BMDCs ( Kao et al . , 2006 ) . However they also demonstrated much less secretion of IL - 12 and IL - 10 in the H . pylori - infected BMDCs compared to BMDCs stimulated with another gastritis - causing pathogen , Acinetobacter lwoffi ( A . lwoffi ) ( Kao et al . , 2006 ) . The authors found H . pylori - stimulated BMDCs induced the release of IFN - γ and TNF - α from T cells , but to a lesser extent than A . lwoffi - stimulated BMDCs . Furthermore they found that H . pylori could effectively inhibit the release of IL - 12 but not IL - 10 from the BMDCs stimulated with A . lwoffi ( Kao et al . , 2006 ) . These results led the authors to suggest that H . pylori can have inhibitory effects on the dendritic cell , causing defects in the host immune response ( Kao et al . , 2006 ) . A more recent study by the same group found that H . pylori induced BMDCs to polarize a Treg polarized response , maintaining high levels of Tregs and decreasing Th17 development in a TGF - β and IL - 10 dependent manner ( Kao et al . , 2010 ) . In this study the authors suggest that this DC - induced Treg polarization and Th17 suppression facilitates H . pylori persistence and immune escape ( Kao et al . , 2010 ) . In contrast , a study by Khamri et al . found that H . pylori stimulated human monocyte - derived DCs to secrete IL - 23 and IFN - γ , which induced the production of IL - 17 - secreting Th17 cells ( Khamri et al . , 2010 ) . The authors found that the cag PAI and an intact T4SS were required for this DC - mediated IL - 17 production ( Khamri et al . , 2010 ) . Finally , a recent study showed that H . pylori induces the development of tolerogenic DCs which stimulate naïve T cells to express Foxp3 ; these DCs were capable of preventing airway 21 hyperresponsiveness in a murine experimental model of asthma ( Oertli et al . , 2012 ) . In this study H . pylori did not induce maturation of BMDCs as assessed by CD40 , CD80 , and CD86 cell surface expression but induced secretion of IL - 10 from these immature DCs . Indeed the authors showed that H . pylori inhibited LPS - induced maturation of DCs in a contact dependent manner . H . pylori also inhibited LPS - induced secretion of IL - 6 and IL - 12 ( Oertli et al . , 2012 ) . The authors demonstrated that H . pylori induces the BMDCs to drive Foxp3 + Treg development and that the release of TGF - β and IL - 18 from the DC was necessary to drive this Treg conversion ( Oertli et al . , 2012 ) . Supporting these results are studies that show H . pylori - specific Tregs can suppress memory T - cell responses to H . pylori in infected individuals ( Lundgren et al . , 2003 ) . This stimulation of immunosuppressive Tregs by H . pylori also decreases gastric tumor immunosurveillance and immune response to tumor antigens ( Groux , 2003 ) . Tregs have been shown to contribute to myeloma - related immune dysfunction , and the accumulation of Tregs in various human carcinomas is associated with a poor prognosis ( Braga et al . , 2012 ; Ladoire et al . , 2011 ) . Furthermore the balance between immunosuppressive Tregs and highly inflammatory Th17 cells is perturbed in many human cancers , indicating that these classes play a key role in the potential development or suppression of cancer ( Braga et al . , 2012 ) . Thus the studies to date assessing H . pylori and dendritic cells contain some conflicting results . Methodological differences can explain some of these paradoxical results . Different strains of H . pylori are used in these studies ; these strains often differ in terms of pathogenicity owing to differences in expression of virulence factors such as VacA , CagA , and the cag PAI itself . Furthermore the “dendritic cells” used in the studies vary quite widely , as some studies use murine bone marrow - derived dendritic cells , others use human peripheral monocyte - derived DCs , which still others take pre - differentiated DCs from the gastric mucosa . Among the cultured DCs , even slight differences in culture conditions can affect the phenotype of the DC before it has even been exposed to the H . pylori . Finally , the use of different controls , and the comparison of H . pylori ’s effects to those of different bacteria can explain differences in the presentation of some results . However despite these concessions , it is clear that the effects of H . pylori infection on DCs remain unclear , and the mechanisms by which the bacteria evades or moderates the host immune response are still being elucidated . 22 1 . 2 . 4 H . pylori - altered DCs : potential role in disease Additional evidence for the ability of H . pylori to affect the host immune system can be found in recent epidemiological studies which link H . pylori infection with protection against the development of several autoimmune and immune - mediated diseases . As H . pylori has infected and coevolved with human hosts for at least 50 , 000 years ; the presence of this bacterium has likely influenced the evolution and development of modern human physiology and immunology ( Atherton and Blaser , 2009 ) . Yet H . pylori colonization is presently detected in fewer than 6 % of children in developed countries ; this eradication of an immunological influence has been epidemiologically correlated with an increase in the occurrence of several disease pathologies . H . pylori eradication has been associated with an increase in gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) , Barrett’s oesophagus , and the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma ( Atherton and Blaser , 2009 ) . Additionally H . pylori infection has been negatively associated with esophageal eosinophilia , an allergic inflammatory condition ( Dellon et al . , 2011 ) . An inverse association between H . pylori colonization and asthma has also been described ( Chen and Blaser , 2007 ) . Recently , a study attempting to elucidate the mechanisms behind this correlation used mouse models of allergen - induced asthma ( Arnold et al . , 2011a ) . In this study , mice were infected with H . pylori as newborns or as adults ; neonatal mice infected with H . pylori displayed a reduction in multiple asthma indicators . Significantly , this protection was associated with both impaired maturation of DCs that infiltrated the lungs and accumulation of Tregs . This protection was abrogated by antibiotic elimination of H . pylori and abolished by systemic Treg depletion . Furthermore , adoptive transfer of purified Tregs was sufficient to confer protection to uninfected recipient mice ( Arnold et al . , 2011a ) . More recently the same group found that H . pylori causes DCs to drive Treg differentiation and induce immune tolerance ( Oertli et al . , 2012 ) . Interestingly the authors showed that H . pylori exposure was able to prevent DCs from inducing asthma in a DC - mediated experimental model of asthma ( Oertli et al . , 2012 ) . Furthermore Tregs from H . pylori - infected mice were able to prevent asthma in this model . H . pylori infection has also been found to be inversely correlated with the incidence of Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD ) ( Luther et al . , 2010 ) . A recent study demonstrated that H . pylori DNA had an increase in immunoregulatory DNA sequences and that incubation of DCs with this DNA reduced proinflammatory cytokine expression as compared to E . coli DNA 23 ( Luther et al . , 2011 ) . Furthermore , the H . pylori DNA was able to suppress the inflammatory response caused by the E . coli DNA . In addition , administration of H . pylori DNA reduced dextran sodium sulphate - induced colitis in a murine model while E . coli DNA did not . This presents an intriguing mechanism for the negative correlation between H . pylori infection and IBD , and demonstrates a new pathway by which H . pylori DNA can alter host immunity . Collectively these studies further demonstrate that H . pylori can modulate the host immune system . In some cases this negatively impacts the host , allowing for persistent infection and decreasing immune tumor surveillance to cause cancer . However it also appears to play a beneficial role in the prevention of other immune - mediated disorders and pathologies . Importantly DCs may play a potential role in mediating these effects . 1 . 2 . 5 Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) The mechanisms by which H . pylori evades and modulates the host immune response remain unclear . One potential mechanism by which H . pylori may modulate the host immune response is through activation of the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) pathway . STAT3 is a member of the STAT family , signal transducer proteins that are activated by the tyrosine phosphorylation cascade in response to ligand binding . STAT3 is a cytoplasmic protein that acts as a signal messenger and transcription factor to induce cellular responses to cytokines and growth factors . Importantly hyperactivation of STAT3 is found in many human cancers and is correlated with both tumor progression and poor prognosis ( Lin et al . , 2010 ) . Recent work form our laboratory indicates that during H . pylori infection in vivo , STAT3 is activated in gastric epithelial cells in a CagA - dependent manner . ( Bronte - Tinkew et al . , 2009 ) . STAT3 activation was also found in a subset of infiltrating immune cells ( Bronte - Tinkew et al . , 2009 ) . Therefore H . pylori possesses the ability to manipulate and activate this crucial signaling cascade whose abberrant activation is found in many human cancers . 1 . 2 . 5 . 1 STAT3 Signaling STAT3 is activated via a tyrosine phosphorylation cascade in response to exctracellular ligand binding . Ligands that activate the STAT3 pathway include cytokines such as IL - 10 and IL - 6 and growth factors such as Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) ( Lin et al . , 2010 ) . The ligand ( e . g . IL - 6 ) binds to its receptor ( IL - 6R ) on the cell surface ( Figure 1 . 2 - 4 ) . The IL - 6R then 24 dimerizes with a gp130 subunit , resulting in the phosphorylation and activation of associated Janus Kinase 2 ( JAK2 ) enzymes ( Kim et al . , 2007 ) . JAK2 is a tyrosine kinase which phosphorylates tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic tail of the gp130 subunit ( Greenlund et al . , 1995 ) . The phosphorylated tyrosines recruit cytoplasmic STAT3 monomers to the gp130 subunit . The STAT3 monomers are subsequently phosphorylated on their Y705 residues , and dimerize through Src - Homology 2 domain ( SH2 ) phosphotyrosine interactions . The phosphorylated STAT3 dimer ( PSTAT3 ) is then translocated into the nucleus via nuclear localization signals ( Reich and Liu , 2006 ) . Inside the nucleus DNA binding domains permit binding to promoter regions of target genes which are involved in cell maturation , growth , proliferation , angiogenesis and immune function ( Kim et al . , 2007 ; Kisseleva et al . , 2002 ; Levy and Darnell , 2002 ) . Importantly , STAT3 is implicated in tumorigenesis and cancer progression . Abberant , constitutive STAT3 activation has been found in a majority of both hematopoeitic and epithelial cancers as well as tumour cells ( Ernst and Putoczki , 2011 ; Wang et al . , 2004 ) . Constitutive STAT3 activation in diverse human cancers enhances tumor proliferation , angiogenesis , metastasis , and survival , and inhibits tumor apoptosis as well as antitumor immunity ( Wang et al . , 2004 ; Yu et al . , 2009 ) . 25 Figure 1 . 2 - 4 : STAT3 signaling pathway The extracellular signaling ligand ( e . g . IL - 6 ) binds to the receptor ( IL - 6αR ) on the cell surface . The receptor dimerizes with the gp130 subunit , activating Janus kinases ( JAK2 ) associated with the cytoplasmic tail . The JAK2 kinases initiate tyrosine phosphorylation of the gp130 cytoplasmic tail , recruiting STAT3 monomers to the phosphorylated tail . The JAK2 kinases then phosphorylate the STAT3 monomers on the Y705 residue , allowing them to dimerize via Src - Homology 2 ( SH2 ) domains . The importin αβ complex then translocates the phosphorylated STAT3 dimer ( PSTAT3 ) into the nucleus , where it binds to and induces transcription of STAT3 response genes , which are involved in angiogenesis , cell proliferation , and immune moderation . Modified from Ang ( 2010 ) . 26 1 . 2 . 5 . 2 STAT3 Activation in Dendritic Cells STAT3 activation in dendritic cells is a potential mechanism by which the DC response is disrupted by H . pylori , leading to immune disruption and potentially carcinogenesis . Current evidence suggests that DC maturation is inhibited by STAT3 activation , while inhibition of STAT3 in dendritic cells promotes DC maturation ( Lin et al . , 2010 ; Melillo et al . , 2010 ) . STAT3 activation is often associated with tolerogenic functions ( Barton , 2006 ; Cheng et al . , 2003 ; Nefedova et al . , 2005 ) . Indeed many tumors secrete high levels of the growth factor VEGF ; this VEGF activates STAT3 in DCs , preventing their maturation and thus decreasing the host immune tumor surveillance ( Lin et al . , 2010 ) . Iwata - Kajihara et al . demonstrated that STAT3 - depleted DCs were more resistant to cancer - cell derived inhibitory factors ( Iwata - Kajihara et al . , 2011 ) . These STAT3 - deficient BMDCs were more potent activators of T cells and had a high capacity to induce Th1 responses ( Iwata - Kajihara et al . , 2011 ) . STAT3 signaling is also necessary for Th17 development ( Harris et al . , 2007 ) . This highly inflammatory STAT3 - dependent Th17 response has been shown to be pro - carcinogenic ( Wang et al . , 2009 ) . Therefore it appears STAT3 activation in dendritic cells supports a pro - tumorigenic environment . Furthermore STAT3 activation in DCs prevents their maturation and activation , which decreases immune surveillance and represents a potential mechanism by which the host immune response can be manipulated . 1 . 3 Summary H . pylori is a gastric pathogen that has the ability to alter the host immune response . Infection with H . pylori persists for the lifetime of the host despite the induction of chronic gastritis , a low - level inflammatory immune response . The bacterium is a type I carcinogen and plays a causative role in gastric cancer , potentially by inhibiting host tumor immunosurveillance . Epidemiologic evidence indicates that H . pylori infection is negatively correlated with several autoimmune and immune - mediated diseases , supporting a role for the bacteria in altering immune responses . Dendritic cells are ideal targets for the pathogen’s immune - altering efforts as they play a key role in modulating the host’s immune response . DCs can drive powerful effector responses to pathogenic organisms and necrotic / tumor cells as well as tolerant regulatory responses to commensal organsisms and self - antigens . Therefore the hypothesis that H . pylori may manipulate this key immune orchestrator in order to evade the immune response and persist in 27 the host is both intriguing and plausible . Mechanistically the activation of STAT3 in dendritic cells has been shown to prevent DC maturation and inhibit DC - driven effector T cell responses ( Iwata - Kajihara et al . , 2011 ; Melillo et al . , 2010 ) . STAT3 activation may decrease tumor immunosurveillance by DCs to contribute to cancer development ( Lin et al . , 2010 ) . H . pylori activates STAT3 in both epithelial cells and infiltrating immune cells ( Bronte - Tinkew et al . , 2009 ) . Thus , H . pylori could activate STAT3 in DCs to modify DC maturation / activation and thereby alter immune responses to promote persistence and inhibit DC tumor immunosurveillance . Hypothesis H . pylori activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) in dendritic cells to promote chronic infection and disease . Specific Aims This hypothesis will be addressed using several specific aims . Aim 1 : Determine whether H . pylori activates STAT3 in bone marrow derived dendritic cells and characterize the phenotype of DCs . Aim 2 : Determine the effect of STAT3 activation on DCs during H . pylori infection . Aim 3 : Determine the mechanism of STAT3 activation in DCs during H . pylori infection . Aim 4 : Determine how H . pylori infected dendritic cells modulate T cell development . 28 Chapter 2 Materials and Methods 2 2 . 1 Bone Marrow - Derived Dendritic Cells Bone Marrow - Derived Dendritic Cells ( BMDCs ) were obtained and cultured from C57BL6 wildtype ( WT ) mice , 6 - 8 weeks old . BMDCs were also obtained from STAT3 CD11c - Cre knockout ( KO ) mice or littermate controls ( Melillo et al . , 2010 ) . Bone marrow was extracted from the femur and tibia and seeded at 2 x 10 5 cells / ml with DC media ( Lutz and Rossner , 2007 ) . DC media contains : Roswell Park Memorial Institute ( RPMI ) - 1640 media , 10 % fetal bovine serum , 1 % L - glutamine , 1 % penicillin / streptomycin , 1X sodium pyruvate , 1X non - essential amino acids , and 0 . 1 % 2 - mercaptoethanol . Recombinant murine granulocyte macrophage colony - stimulating factor ( GM - CSF ) was added at a concentration of 40ng / ml , to stimulate dendritic cell growth ( Lutz and Rossner , 2007 ) . DCs were seeded on bacteriological petri dishes with 10ml DC media supplemented with GM - CSF for 3 days at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 . On day 3 , an additional 10ml of DC media supplemented with GM - CSF was added to each plate . On day 6 and day 8 10ml of the solution from each plate was removed , centrifuged to pellet floating cells , and resuspended with 10ml of fresh DC media supplemented with GM - CSF per plate . On day 10 , the floating , non - adherent cell population ( immature DCs ) was harvested , counted , and plated in 6 - well tissue culture plates in antibiotic - free DC media to be used for treatment / infection . 2 . 2 Treatment / Infection H . pylori strain 7 . 13 was grown on Columbia blood agar plates ( supplemented with 5 % sheep blood ) under microaerophilic conditions ( 5 % O 2 , 10 % CO 2 , 85 % N 2 ) for 72h ( Zheng and Jones , 2003 ) . Bacteria were then collected using sterile inoculation loops and transferred into a bacterial flask containing Brucella broth supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum for 24 hours . Bacteria were then harvested by centrifugation , resuspended in antibiotic - free DC media , and added to immature BMDCs at a multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) of 10 : 1 . Treated cells were incubated at 37°C for 20 hours . The optimal infection time was previously determined using a series of time - course experiments ( Ang , 2010 ) . A set of untreated DCs served as control cells . A set of DCs 29 was treated with IL - 6 [ 100ng / ml ] to serve as a positive control for STAT3 activation , and a negative control for DC maturation ( Niemand et al . , 2003 ) . The optimal dosage of IL - 6 was determined by a dose - response experiment performed previously ( Ang , 2010 ) . An additional set of DCs was treated with E . coli lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ; Sigma Aldrich ) [ 1ng / ml ] to serve as a positive control for DC maturation ( Foti et al . , 1999 ) . Treatment of DCs with a neutralizing rat - anti - mouse IL - 10 antibody ( eBioscience , San Diego , CA , USA ) [ 0 . 5µg / ml or 1µg / ml ] was conducted to examine the effects of IL - 10 on the DC maturation and STAT3 activation . Rat - anti - IgG antibody ( BioLegend , San Diego , CA , USA ) [ 1µg / ml ] served as a control antibody to ensure the specificity of the IL - 10 antibody - mediated effects . After 20 hours of incubation the cells were harvested for analysis . Western blotting was used to examine STAT3 phosphorylation and activation . Flow cytometry using αCD11c , αCD86 , and αMHC class II fluorophores was used to examine the maturation status of the dendritic cells . ELISA assays and multiplex bead assays will be used to examine the cytokine release profile of the dendritic cells . 2 . 3 Western Blotting After 20h of treatment / infection , cells were harvested by vigorous pipetting and washed with phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ; Sigma Aldrich ) . Cells were lysed using 100µl of a radioimmunoprecipitation assay ( RIPA ) buffer cocktail supplemented with protease inhibitors on ice . Lysates were centrifuged , supernatants collected and stored at - 20°C ( Bronte - Tinkew et al . , 2009 ) . Lysates ( supplemented with 10 % laemelli buffer ) were loaded onto 12 % SDS - polyacrylamide gels and run at 110V at room temperature for 1 . 5h . Separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane ( BioTrance , NT ; Pall Corp . , All Arbor , MI , USA ) at 30V for 8h at 4°C ( Bronte - Tinkew et al . , 2009 ) . Membranes were then blocked with 5 % skim milk made using Tris - buffered saline supplemented with tween ( TBST ) for 30min , followed by overnight incubation at 4°C using rabbit - anti - PSTAT3 antibody ( 1 : 200 ; Cell Signalling MA , USA ) and mouse - anti - actin antibody ( 1 : 10 , 000 ) in TBST milk . Blots were then incubated using corresponding horseradish peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibodies ( 1 : 2 , 000 and 1 : 10 , 000 for the PSTAT3 and actin primary antibodies , respectively ) for 1h at room temperature ( Bronte - Tinkew et al . , 2009 ) . Bands were then visualized by chemiluminescence using Kodak Biomax MR film or FluorChem E Imager ( Proteinsimple , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) . 30 2 . 4 Densitometric analysis Densitometry was performed utilizing the FlourChem FCII software . Densities of PSTAT3 and actin bands were measured for each treatment and expressed as a ratio of PSTAT3 / actin , and then normalized to the control treatment . 2 . 5 Flow Cytometry After 20h of treatment / infection , BMDCs were harvested by vigorous pipetting and centrifuged at 350g for 10min . Supernatants were collected and stored at - 20°C to examine cytokine release profile . Cells were rinsed using flow cytometry buffer ( FB ) ( PBS supplemented with 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) ) , and then incubated with anti - CD16 / 32 ( FC receptor block ; eBioscience , San Diego CA USA ) [ 25µg / µl ] for 15min on ice , to block non - specific antibody binding ( Oliver et al . , 1999 ) . DCs were then incubated with flourescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - labelled αCD11c , phycoerythrin ( PE ) - labelled αCD86 , and allophcocyanin ( APCa ) - labelled αMHC class II antibodies ( all from eBioscience ) for 30min . DCs were then washed twice with FB before fixation using 1x paraformadehyde ( PFA , made with PBS ) for 20min . Cells were subsequently washed with FB and analyzed using a LSR - II flow cytometer ( Becton Dickson , San Jose , CA , USA ) . Flow cytometry data was then analyzed utilizing FlowJo software ( Tree Star Inc , Ashland , OR , USA ) . 2 . 6 ELISA Cytokine Analysis BMDCs were infected for 20h as described above . Supernatants were collected and stored at - 80°C . Supernatants were assayed for IL - 6 , IL - 10 , IL - 12p40 and TNF - α using specific ELISAs as per the manufacturer’s instructions ( R & D systems , MN , USA ) . 2 . 7 Multiplex Bead - based Luminex Assay Supernatants from BMDCs were assayed for IL - 2 , IL - 4 , IL - 5 , IL - 10 , IL - 12 , IL - 17 , and IFN - γ using the Th1 / Th2 Cytokine Mouse 6 - Plex Panel kit plus the IL - 17 Mouse Singleplex Bead Luminex Assay Kit as per the manufacturer’s instructions ( Invitrogen ) . 31 2 . 8 OT - II Transgenic Mouse CD4 + Splenocytes OT - II transgenic mice were kindly donated by the laboratory of Dr . Tania Watts or purchased from Jackson Laboratory . These transgenic mice express the mouse alpha - chain and beta - chain T cell receptor that pairs with the CD4 coreceptor and is specific for chicken ovalbumin 323 - 339 in the context of the MHC class II molecule ( Barnden et al . , 1998 ) . Consequently all CD4 + splenocytes ( i . e . T cells ) harvested from these animals will be activated when presented with the ovalbumin peptide by APCs ( such as DCs ) with appropriate co - receptors and cytokine stimulation ( Barnden et al . , 1998 ) . This circumvents the need for antigen specificity when working with a model of T cell activation by APCs . 2 . 9 STAT3 KO Mice STAT3 KO mice were kindly donated by the laboratory of Dr . Tak Mak or Dr . Christian Schindler . These DC - specific STAT3 KO mice were generated using a Cre - flox system . Briefly , Stat3 flox / flox mice , in a 129 / C57BL / 6J mixed background were crossed seven generations onto C57BL / 6J background , and then with CD11c - BAC - Cre transgenic mice ( Melillo et al . , 2010 ) . STAT3 expression was examined via immunoblotting to confirm knockout . 2 . 10 DC : T Cell Coincubation Sets of DCs were loaded with 10ng / ml or 100ng / ml ovalbumin peptide 323 - 339 ( OVA ) with or without H . pylori for 20h . DCs were then counted and incubated with splenocytes from OT - II transgenic mice ( at a ratio of 1 : 2 ) which were harvested and magnetically sorted for the CD25 - CD4 + population according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( Miltenyi Biotec , Bergisch Gladbach , Germany ) , in DC media with or without recombinant murine IL - 2 [ 10ng / ml ] and recombinant human TGF - β1 [ 10ng / ml ] ( Oertli et al . , 2012 ) . The coculture was incubated for 72h at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 . Cells were then harvested , supernatants collected to examine cytokine release using ELISA - based assays , and flow cytometry performed to examine T cell phenotype using αCD4 and αFoxP3 fluorophores ( Oertli et al . , 2012 ) . 32 2 . 11 Statistical Analysis All experiments were performed at least 3 times , and statistical significance ( P values ) was calculated using a one - way ANOVA to compare the means ± SE for independent treatment groups . A P value of less than 0 . 05 was deemed statistically significant . 33 Chapter 3 Results 3 3 . 1 H . pylori infection induces STAT3 phosphorylation in dendritic cells To determine whether H . pylori induces activation of the STAT3 pathway in DCs , expression of phosphorylated STAT3 ( PSTAT3 ) was measured in dendritic cell lysates using western blotting . Cultured BMDCs were incubated with H . pylori strain 7 . 13 at an MOI of 10 : 1 , treated with IL - 6 ( a known activator of STAT3 ) , or treated with E . coli LPS ( a known inducer of DC maturation ) for 20h . Immunoblot analysis of these cell lysates revealed phosphorylation of STAT3 in DCs treated with H . pylori and IL - 6 compared to uninfected control and LPS - treated cells ( Figure 3 . 1 - 1A , B ) . 34 C I L - 6 L P S H P 7 . 13 0 2 4 6 8 * * * * B PS T A T 3 : A c t i n no r m a li z e d t o C ns Figure 3 . 1 - 1 : H . pylori activates the STAT3 pathway in dendritic cells A ) Lysates from DCs incubated with H . pylori strain 7 . 13 at an MOI of 10 : 1 , IL - 6 [ 100ng / ml ] , or E . coli LPS [ 1ng / ml ] for 20h were subjected to immunoblot analysis to examine changes in STAT3 phosphorylation .

BMDCs were untreated ( C ) or treated with IL - 6 [ 100ng / ml ] , E . coli LPS [ 1ng / ml ] , or Helicobacter pylori strain 7 . 13 at a MOI of 10 : 1 and incubated for 20h . Flow cytometry was performed using a BD LSR - II flow cytometer to quantify and analyze the expression of the DC maturation markers CD86 and MHC class II . Expression of the DC - specific marker CD11c was used to select a pure dendritic cell population ( Figure 3 . 2 - 1A ) . H . pylori infection increased the proportion of MHC II hi CD86 hi BMDCs to a similar extent as treatment with E . coli LPS , whereas treatment with the STAT3 activator IL - 6 did not increase the expression of these maturation markers compared to untreated ( control ) cells ( Figure 3 . 2 - 1B , C ) . 36 A C I L - 6 L P S H P 0 10 20 30 40 * * * % M HC II h i CD 86 h i DC s Figure 3 . 2 - 1 : H . pylori induces expression of dendritic cell maturation markers A ) Live dendritic cells were selected based on their size ( FSC ) , complexity ( SSC ) , and expression of the DC - specific marker CD11c .

The culture supernatants from control , H . pylori , LPS , and IL - 6 treated BMDCs were subjected to Luminex multiplex assays which profiled levels of the following cytokines : IL - 2 , IL - 4 , IL - 5 , IL - 10 , IL - 12 , IL - 17 , and IFN - γ . Treatment with H . pylori increased the levels of IL - 10 and IL - 12 in the BMDC culture supernatants ( Figure 3 . 3 - 1A ) . H . pylori infection also increased the ratio of IL - 10 : IL - 12 released by the BMDC . In contrast treatment with proinflammatory LPS increased the IL12 : IL - 10 ratio ( Figure 3 . 3 - 1B ) . These results were confirmed with ELISA - based assays which revealed significant increases in IL - 10 and TNF - α release from BMDCs in response to H . pylori infection , as well as non - significant IL - 12p40 increases ( Figure 3 - 3C ) . 39 40 Figure 3 . 3 - 1 : Dendritic cells secrete a specific cytokine profile upon infection with H . pylori A ) Luminex milliplex assay was used to assess cytokine secretion for Th1 / Th2 cytokines ( IL - 2 , IL - 4 , IL - 5 , IL - 10 , IL - 12 , IL - 17 and IFN - γ in cell supernatants obtained from BMDCs incubated with either E . coli LPS ( 1μg / ml ) , IL - 6 ( 100ng / ml ) , or WT H . pylori strain 7 . 13 ( MOI 25 : 1 ) for 24h .

Ang . 41 3 . 4 H . pylori induces more pronounced maturation in STAT3 KO dendritic cells I next elucidated the effect of H . pylori - induced STAT3 activation in dendritic cells by utilizing BMDCs derived from dendritic cell - specific STAT3 KO mice ( kindly provided by the laboratory of Dr . Tak Mak ) . A CD11c - Cre STAT3 - flox system was used to generate Cre + flox + BMDCs that lack STAT3 expression . Cre - sex - matched littermates provided control STAT3 + BMDCs . Cre + ( STAT3 KO ) and Cre - ( WT ) BMDCs were treated with IL - 6 [ 100ng / ml ] , E . coli LPS [ 1ng / ml ] , no treatment ( C ) , or Helicobacter pylori strains 7 . 13 and 60190 at a MOI of 10 : 1 and incubated for 20h . Sets of STAT3 KO and WT DCs were then lysed and immunoblotting performed to determine STAT3 expression and activation . STAT3 KO ( Cre + ) DCs lacked STAT3 expression ( Figure 3 . 4 - 1A ) . In parallel , DCs from each condition were stained with αCD11c , αCD86 , and αMHC class II fluorophores and flow cytometry analysis was performed to quantify the expression . H . pylori infection induced significantly more maturation as assessed by expression of maturation markers in the STAT3 KO dendritic cells as compared to the WT DCs ( Figure 3 . 4 - 1B , C ) . 42 B A 43 C o n t r o l I L - 6 L P S H . p y l o r i C o n t r o l I L - 6 L P S H . p y l o r i 0 20 40 60 80 * * * * * WT KO * C Treatment % M HC II + CD 86 + DC s Figure 3 . 4 - 1 : STAT3 KO DCs express enhanced levels of maturation markers in response to H . pylori infection A ) Lysates from STAT3 KO ( Cre + ) and WT ( littermate Cre - control ) DCs incubated with H . pylori strain 7 . 13 at an MOI of 10 : 1 , IL - 6 [ 100ng / ml ] , or E . coli LPS [ 1ng / ml ] for 20h were subjected to immunoblotting analysis to determine changes in STAT3 phosphorylation .

An isotype control IgG antibody was used to ensure the specificity of the IL - 10 antibody . BMDCs were lysed and immunoblotting performed to examine phosphorylation of STAT3 . Treatment with the α - IL - 10 antibody inhibited the STAT3 phosphorylation induced by H . pylori in the BMDCs ( Figure 3 . 5 - 1A , B ) . Importantly , α - IL - 10 treatment also enhanced expression of the maturation markers MHC class II and CD86 in BMDCs in response to H . pylori infection as compared to BMDCs treated with H . pylori alone ( Figure3 - 5C ) . Treatment with the isotype control IgG antibody affected neither the STAT3 phosphorylation induced in the BMDCs by H . pylori ( Figure 3 . 5 - 1A , B ) nor the maturation of the BMDCs in response to the H . pylori ( Figure 3 . 5 - 1C ) , demonstrating that this was an IL - 10 - specific effect . 45 C H P C H P H P C H P 0 1 2 3 4 5 n = 4 B * * * * * * * No antibody  IL - 10 ( 1  g / ml )  IL - 10 ( 0 . 5  g / ml )  IgG ( 1  g / ml ) PS T A T 3 : A c t i n no r m a li z e d t o C C H P C H P H P C H P 0 10 20 30 40 50 * * * ns n = 4  IL - 10 ( 1  g / ml )  IL - 10 ( 0 . 5  g / ml ) No antibody  IgG ( 1  g / ml ) C % M HC II + CD 86 + D C s 46 Figure 3 . 5 - 1 : α - IL - 10 antibody inhibits H . pylori - induced STAT3 phosphorylation in BMDCs to promote enhanced expression of maturation markers A ) Lysates from BMDCs treated with functional grade α - IL - 10 antibody [ 0 . 5 or 1µg / ml ] or isotype control IgG antibody [ 1µg / ml ] , in the presence or absence of H . pylori , were subjected to immunoblotting analysis to determine STAT3 phosphorylation levels .

STAT3 KO and WT BMDCs were incubated with H . pylori for 20h prior to 6h treatment with penicillin - streptomycin to kill any remaining extracellular bacteria . These BMDCs were then loaded with differing concentrations of the ovalbumin peptide ( OVA ; residues 323 - 339 ) for 6h . BMDCs were then co - incubated with naïve CD4 + CD25 - splenocytes from OT - II transgenic mice at a ratio of 1 : 2 . Recombinant murine IL - 2 [ 10ng / ml ] ( R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN , USA ) and recombinant human TGF - β1 [ 10ng / ml ] ( PeproTech , Rocky Hill , NJ , USA ) were added to drive regulatory T cell development ( Kryczek et al . , 2007 ; Malek , 2003 ) . Cells were cultured for 72h before they were harvested , supernatants collected , and cells were stained with αCD4 and αFoxP3 fluorophores to examine regulatory T cell ( Treg ) development . Loading BMDCs with a low dose of the ovalbumin antigen ( 10ng / ml ) combined with addition of the recombinant cytokines IL - 2 and TGF - β1 was sufficient to drive CD4 + FoxP3 + Treg development ( Figure 3 . 6 - 1A ) . Furthermore STAT3 KO BMDCs induced development of lower levels of CD4 + FoxP3 + Tregs ( Figure 3 . 6 - 1B ) . However both STAT3 KO and WT BMDCs treated with H . pylori did not induce production of CD4 + FoxP3 + Tregs ( Figure 3 . 6 - 1C , D ) . 48 A B 49 Figure 3 . 6 - 1 : H . pylori infection does not induce dendritic cells to produce CD4 + FoxP3 + T cells A ) Immature BMDCs were loaded with ovalbumin peptide ( residues 323 - 339 ) [ 10ng / ml or 100ng / ml ] for 6h .

C D 50 Chapter 4 Discussion 4 The ability to alter and evade the host immune response is crucial for the survival and persistence of H . pylori in the host gastric mucosa . As dendritic cells are key orchestrators of the host immune response , they are ideal targets for the pathogen’s immune - manipulating efforts . The interaction between H . pylori and dendritic cells is beginning to be elucidated , but the mechanisms by which H . pylori affects DC function are still being determined . This study demonstrated for the first time that H . pylori activated the STAT3 pathway in dendritic cells . This STAT3 activation serves to blunt DC maturation , as H . pylori infection induced more maturation ( as assessed by expression of the maturation markers MHC II and CD86 ) in STAT3 KO DCs as compared to control DCs . This is consistent with current literature indicating that STAT3 is a negative regulator of DC maturation and function ( Iwata - Kajihara et al . , 2011 ; Lin et al . , 2010 ; Melillo et al . , 2010 ) . The H . pylori - mediated STAT3 activation in dendritic cells represents a potential mechanism by which H . pylori manipulates the immune system to persist and promote carcinogenesis . STAT3 activation in DCs is often associated with tolerogenic functions ( Barton , 2006 ; Cheng et al . , 2003 ; Nefedova et al . , 2005 ) ; therefore this H . pylori - induced STAT3 activation could potentially induce tolerant DCs that suppress immune responses to the bacteria instead of inducing effector immune responses . This represents a novel potential mechanism by which the bacterium evades the host immune response to persist in the gastric mucosa and may also help to explain the causative role of H . pylori in gastric cancer development . Current evidence indicates that STAT3 activation in DCs contributes to tumor progression by preventing DC maturation and thus decreasing the host tumor immunosurveillance ( Lin et al . , 2010 ) . Indeed it was demonstrated that STAT3 - depleted DCs were more resistant to cancer - cell derived inhibitory factors ( Iwata - Kajihara et al . , 2011 ) . Therefore the activation of STAT3 in DCs by H . pylori may potentially inhibit the DC responses to tumors that develop in the gastric mucosa while simultaneously inhibiting the DC responses to the bacterium . 51 In this study IL - 6 was used as a control to drive STAT3 activation in the dendritic cells , and while H . pylori induced STAT3 activation , it was not as pronounced at the IL - 6 - mediated STAT3 activation ( Figure 3 . 1 - 1 ) . As IL - 6 is a ligand that binds to its receptor to induce STAT3 activation , a strong induction of STAT3 phosphorylation upon treatment with this pure ligand is expected . However live H . pylori has numerous virulence factors , secreted proteins , and adhesion molecules , and interacts with the DC in multiple ways . Therefore it is not surprising that the potency of the DC STAT3 activation by this live organism is slightly lower than that of the pure ligand IL - 6 . In response to H . pylori infection DC maturation is blunted and the dendritic cells secrete a specific cytokine profile , including IL - 10 , the IL - 12p40 subunit , TNF - α , and an increased IL10 : IL - 12p40 ratio . IL - 10 is a multifunctional cytokine that acts as an autocrine and paracrine inhibitor of DC maturation and function ( Corinti et al . , 2001 ) . IL - 10 also activates the STAT3 pathway ( Lin et al . , 2010 ) . Therefore an IL - 10 - neutralizing antibody was used to determine if the H . pylori - mediated IL - 10 secretion was acting as an autocrine / paracrine activator of STAT3 . Treatment with the neutralizing antibody completed abrogated the H . pylori - mediated STAT3 activation in the DCs . Furthermore anti - IL - 10 treatment resulted in increased maturation of DCs in response to H . pylori infection , indicating that this IL - 10 autocrine / paracrine activation of STAT3 is responsible for the blunted DC maturation . IL - 10 has been shown to possess immunoregulatory potential and induce the differentiation of FoxP3 + Tregs ( Lan et al . , 2006 ) . Furthermore a recent study demonstrated that H . pylori - infected murine BMDCs drove the development of FoxP3 + Tregs that had potent immunoregulatory capacities ( Oertli et al . , 2012 ) . Therefore we co - incubated our H . pylori - infected dendritic cells with naïve CD4 + T cells and examined the ensuing FoxP3 expression in an effort to replicate their results . However , we found that H . pylori - infected DCs did not drive FoxP3 expression in T cells . Methodological differences can potentially explain the differing results , as the BMDCs were grown using slightly differing protocols . Furthermore Oertli et al . utilized the pre - mouse clinical isolate strain PMSS1 , while our study used the 7 . 13 mouse - adapted strain . Importantly the 7 . 13 strain has been shown to be highly carcinogenic and injects significant amounts of the CagA toxin into cells ( Franco et al . , 2008 ) . Interestingly , recent evidence indicates that tolerant responses ( mediated by Tregs ) rather than immunity ( mediated by effector T cells ) are protective against H . pylori - induced gastric cancer precursor lesions ( Arnold et al . , 2011b ) . Therefore it is 52 entirely plausible that a carcinogenic strain of H . pylori ( 7 . 13 ) would not drive Treg development while a non - carcinogenic strain will induce tolerant Treg responses . Indeed the full complement of cytokines released by DCs in response to H . pylori infection likely play an important role in pathogenesis . TNF - α is a pleiotropic cytokine which , while primarily known to be proinflammatory , has also been shown to play immunoregulatory roles . In fact dendritic - cell derived TNF - α has been shown to be necessary for the development of IL - 10 - producing CD4 + T cells ( Hirata et al . , 2010 ) . Furthermore TNF - α was found to upregulate Programmed Death - 1 ( PD - 1 ) levels on monocytes to cause IL - 10 production , which effectively inhibited T cell expansion and function ( Said et al . , 2010 ) . These studies demonstrate that TNF - α has clear immunoregulatory potential , therefore it is plausible that H . pylori - induced DC secretion of TNF - α may act in an immunoregulatory manner , complementing the IL - 10 secretion and STAT3 activation to dampen the immune response and promote persistence . The IL - 12 cytokine is composed of a p40 ( 40 kDa ) and a p35 ( 35kDa ) subunit ; the biologically active form consists of two covalently linked chains of p40 and p35 and is known as IL - 12p70 ( Oppmann et al . , 2000 ) . The assays used in this study detected the secretion of the IL - 12p40 subunit from the DC in response to H . pylori infection . Importantly the p40 subunit is shared by another member of the IL - 12 cytokine family : IL - 23 . IL - 23 is composed of the p40 subunit and another 19 kDa subunit , p19 ( Oppmann et al . , 2000 ) , and can mediate pro - carcinogenic immune responses ( Kortylewski et al . , 2009 ) . IL - 23 induces the development of Th17 cells ( Iwakura and Ishigame , 2006 ) . Interestingly Th17 cells are proinflammatory and STAT3 signaling has been shown to play a role in Th17 development ( Harris et al . , 2007 ) . The highly inflammatory STAT3 - dependent Th17 response has been shown to be pro - carcinogenic ( Wang et al . , 2009 ) . Therefore the potential implications of H . pylori - mediated DC secretion of IL - 23 for disease pathogenesis are intriguing and require further study . Taken together , these results present a potential model of H . pylori persistence and pathogenesis . H . pylori induce the secretion of IL - 10 from the dendritic cell , which acts in an autocrine and paracrine fashion to activate STAT3 in DCs , blunting maturation . This inhibits the development of proper effector T cell and other immune responses , facilitating bacterial persistence . However the STAT3 activation in the DCs may also decreases DC tumor immunosurveillance . Therefore the manipulation of the DC by H . pylori is a double - edged sword : it induces the secretion of 53 proinflammatory mediators which drive carcinogenesis , and also inhibits DC tumor immunosurveillance to prevent recognition and DC - mediated immune elimination of the developing tumor cells . 54 Figure 4 - 1 : Potential model of dendritic cell responses to H . pylori H . pylori induces immature dendritic cells to mature and secrete IL - 10 , which acts in an autocrine and paracrine fashion to activate STAT3 in DCs , blunting maturation . H . pylori also induces secretion of IL - 12p40 , which may drive Th17 development to promote chronic infection and carcinogenesis . H . pylori infected dendritic cells do not appear to promote regulatory T cell development . 55 While this study provides a reductionist examination of the interaction between H . pylori and the dendritic cell , it is important to recognize the limitations of an in vitro model of host - pathogen interaction . In the infected host the bacterium does not encounter DCs in isolation ; rather it interacts with a plethora of host cells including the gastric epithelial cell and likely other immune cells such as macrophages , neutrophils , and natural killer cells ( Alvarez - Arellano et al . , 2007 ; Jones et al . , 1999 ; Lewis et al . , 2011 ; Yun et al . , 2005 ) . These interactions will likely influence the DC and immune response to the bacteria . Indeed preliminary data from our laboratory suggests that exosomes ( intercellular communicative vesicles ) secreted by H . pylori - infected epithelial cells can influence DC maturation ( data not shown ) . Therefore while the in vitro interaction between H . pylori and cultured murine dendritic cells is an appropriate method for studying this pathogen , it is important to remember that these interactions take place within the context of the full host - pathogen relationship . It has been shown that gastric stromal factors can condition the DC response to H . pylori , suppressing H . pylori - stimulated DC activation ( Bimczok et al . , 2011 ) . This demonstrates that while in vitro assays are useful for examining the interaction between pathogens and isolated cell types , the true in vivo host - pathogen interaction is likely conditioned by numerous factors and may significantly differ from the in vitro results in the laboratory . Therefore this STAT3 activation in DCs may be validated in human H . pylori infection . Gastric tissue sections from H . pylori - infected patients can be assayed for the presence of STAT3 + CD11c + dendritic cells and compared to tissue sections from uninfected control subjects . This would validate these in vitro findings in human H . pylori infection and support the hypothesis that STAT3 activation in DCs is a mechanism by which this pathogen manipulates the host immune response . While the generation of murine bone marrow - derived dendritic cells provides a good tool to study the interaction between H . pylori and immature DCs , there are other methods for generating cultured dendritic cells . One alternative DC culture method involves the differentiation of harvested peripheral blood monocytes into DCs ( Guiney et al . , 2003 ) . The use of DCs derived from human peripheral blood monocytes would allow the validation of H . pylori - induced STAT3 activation in human DCs . Additionally gastric dendritic cells can be harvested from the gastric lamina propria of subjects and infected with H . pylori ( Bimczok et al . , 2010 ) . This would allow for the study of host - generated DCs , which may be more pertinent to human 56 infection than DCs cultured from precursors in a Petri dish . However despite these limitations bone marrow - derived dendritic cells remain an inexpensive , non - invasive , valuable tool to study the interaction between H . pylori and DCs . Other models can be used to validate findings and explore their relevance in infection . There are various strains of H . pylori that differ on many levels , such as pathogenicity and presence of virulence factors . Some strains express a functional cag PAI and inject the CagA toxin , others express the cag PAI and construct a functional T4SS but do not produce CagA , while still others do not express the cag PAI at all . Strains also differ in expression of VacA and the outer membrane protein OipA . Strains that express the intact T4SS and inject the CagA toxin are more carcinogenic than strains that do not express these factors , while the presence of VacA and OipA is also associated with pathological outcomes ( Franco et al . , 2008 ) . This study used the laboratory mouse - adapted H . pylori strain 7 . 13 , which injects large amounts of CagA into host cells ( Franco et al . , 2008 ) . The necessity of the virulence factors for STAT3 activation in the DCs is not examined in this study , nor is the relevance for other H . pylori strains . Despite these limitations , this study describes a novel interaction H . pylori and the dendritic cell , an important moderator of the host immune response . In conclusion , these results demonstrated that H . pylori infection induces the activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway in dendritic cells . Importantly IL - 10 secreted by the DC acted as an autocrine / paracrine activator of STAT3 to blunt DC maturation . Infected DCs also secreted a specific cytokine profile in response to H . pylori infection , which does not appear to drive Treg development . Overall this study describes a novel mechanism by which H . pylori alters the host immune response to facilitate persistence , a mechanism that may also contribute to the carcinogenic potential of this pathogen . 57 Chapter 5 Future Directions The results of this study provide some exciting insights into the interaction between H . pylori and dendritic cells . They also provide multiple future directions to further examine the effect of H . pylori infection on the host immune response . The cytokines released from the STAT3 KO BMDCs infected with H . pylori still need to be fully elucidated and should provide clues as to the specific effect that the STAT3 activation has on the DC cytokine release profile . Particularly it will help to elucidate whether STAT3 activation induces a change in the ratio of the pro - versus anti - inflammatory cytokines that are released . Furthermore the presence of other cytokines such as IL - 18 and TGF - β in the H . pylori - treated DC supernatants was not examined and could be explored in the future . This is pertinent since the Oertli paper found IL - 18 to be critical for the induction of Foxp3 + Treg development by H . pylori - treated DCs ( Oertli et al . , 2012 ) . Similarly TGF - β is a critical cytokine in the development of Tregs as well as Th17 cells , so the presence of this cytokine should be examined to shed light on the T cell responses being driven by the H . pylori - infected DCs . The cytokines released from the DC : T cell cocultures will also help elucidate the phenotype of T cell which is being produced by the dendritic cell in response to H . pylori infection . The mechanisms by which H . pylori induces IL - 10 secretion that activates STAT3 will be interesting to elucidate . Preliminary data indicates that STAT3 activation in the dendritic cells occurs independently of the presence of the CagA toxin ( data not shown ) . Furthermore a heat - stable molecule appears to play a role ( data not shown ) . Previous studies have implicated TLR2 , TLR4 , and TLR9 in recognition of H . pylori by DCs , which lead to secretion of proinflammatory cytokines ( Rad et al . , 2009 ) . Therefore the use of genetically engineered KO mice that lack expression of these innate immune PRRs will help elucidate the role that they play in the IL - 10 secretion and STAT3 activation shown by DCs in response to H . pylori infection . Interestingly the intracellular PRR Nod1 has been shown to recognize H . pylori peptidoglycan that is injected into the host cell by the cag PAI - encoded T4SS ( Grubman et al . , 2010 ; Viala et al . , 2004 ) . Furthermore Nod1 has been shown to work synergistically with TLR2 and TLR4 to induce the secretion of IL - 10 from DCs ( Fritz et al . , 2007 ) . Therefore it is possible that Nod1 signaling in 58 response to H . pylori plays a role in the dendritic cell secretion of IL - 10 , which leads to the autocrine / paracrine activation of STAT3 . The use of Nod1 - specific KO mice will help to elucidate the role of this H . pylori - sensing innate immune receptor . Furthermore correlation of STAT3 activation in DCs with human disease progression will strongly support the role of this pathway in H . pylori pathogenesis . To this end we have access to paraffin - embedded gastric tissues sections from H . pylori patients at the different precancerous stages , including gastritis , atrophy , metaplasia , dysplasia , and adenocarcinoma , as well as control human tissue sections . These sections will be subjected to immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent staining to examine the expression of phosphorylated ( activated ) STAT3 in CD11c + dendritic cells . If increases in the number of CD11c + PSTAT3 + dendritic cells are seen in the progression from gastritis through atrophy , metaplasia , dysplasia , and carcinoma , it would strongly support the hypothesis that STAT3 activation in the DC plays an important role in H . pylori carcinogenesis . Overall this study has demonstrated a novel mechanism by which H . pylori manipulates the dendritic cell , a key orchestrator of the immune response , to promote immune evasion and bacterial persistence . These future studies will further elucidate the mechanisms by which H . pylori induces the STAT3 activation in the DC , and help to delineate the role of this activation in the pathogenesis of the bacteria . 59 References Akopyants , N .
