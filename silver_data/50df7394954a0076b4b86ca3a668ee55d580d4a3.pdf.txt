The role for long - range loops in the establishment of new gene expression patterns during cell fate transitions remains poorly understood . Here , we investigate the link between cell - specific loops and RNA polymerase II ( RNAPolII ) during neural lineage commitment . We find thousands of loops decommissioned or gained de novo upon differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells ( hiPSCs ) to neural progenitors ( NPCs ) and post - mitotic neurons . During hiPSC - to - NPC and NPC - to - neuron transitions , genes changing from RNAPolII initiation to elongation are > 4 - fold more likely to anchor cell - specific loops than repressed genes . Elongated genes exhibit significant mRNA upregulation when connected in cell - specific promoter - enhancer loops but not invariant promoter - enhancer loops , promoter - promoter loops , or unlooped . Genes transitioning from repression to RNAPolII initiation exhibit slight mRNA increase independent of loop status . Our data link cell - specific loops and robust RNAPolII - mediated elongation during neural cell fate transitions . Highlights • Thousands of loops are decommissioned and gained upon human iPSC differentiation to NPCs / neurons • Genes transitioning from initiated - to - elongated exhibit robust mRNA upregulation when connected in cell type - specific promoter - enhancer loops • Genes transitioning from repressed - to - initiated exhibit slight increases in mRNA levels independent of loop status • Upon short - term RNAPolII degradation , loops formed by elongated genes are more severely disrupted than those anchoring initiated genes 3 Introduction Mammalian development requires the precise spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression in defined cell types . Non - coding cis - regulatory elements ( CREs ) known as enhancers regulate cell type - specific patterns of gene expression in metazoans 1 - 3 . CREs can be separated by kilobases ( kb ) up to megabases ( Mb ) from their target genes 4 , 5 , therefore understanding how chromatin loops are involved in governing enhancer - promoter communication is critical toward our knowledge of gene expression regulation . There are three broad categories of long - range looping interactions : promoter - promoter ( P - P ) loops , enhancer - promoter ( E - P ) loops , and structural loops with no direct connection to promoters . In the case of structural loops , it is established that they are anchored by the architectural proteins CTCF and cohesin 6 , 7 . During interphase in steady - state mammalian cells , the cohesin complex extrudes DNA through its ring in an ATP - dependent manner to create transient “loops in the making” 8 - 11 . Cohesin - mediated loop extrusion stalls at CTCF - occupied motifs oriented toward each other in convergent orientation 10 , 12 , 13 . Extrusion stalling manifests empirically as focal ‘dot - like’ structures representing loop anchors in ensemble Hi - C heatmaps 14 . Short - term degradation of CTCF or the Rad21 subunit of cohesin ablates structural loops 15 - 17 . By contrast , only a subset of long - range E - P or P - P loops are anchored by CTCF and sensitive to its degradation 16 . The zinc finger - containing transcription factor Yin Yang 1 ( YY1 ) and subunits of the Mediator complex have recently been linked to E - P loop maintenance , but results vary depending on the cell type and methodologies used for molecular perturbation 16 - 23 . Overall , the mechanisms governing E - P and P - P loops and how they are functionally linked to transcription remain important open questions . Enhancers and promoters are enriched for genetic motifs encoding binding sites for transcription factors . Through the process of protein - protein interactions , motif - bound transcription factors at CREs and transcription start sites ( TSSs ) can recruit co - factors and RNAPolII 24 . Transcription establishment requires assembly of the pre - initiation complex at the gene promoter , Cdk7 - mediated C - terminal phosphorylation of RNAPolII - serine 5 ( Ser5P ) , and RNAPolII initiation 25 - 27 . RNAPolII transcribes promoter - proximal RNA until it pauses approximately 20 - 60 bp downstream of the TSS via the direct binding to negative elongation factor ( NELF ) and DRB - sensitivity - inducing factor ( DSIF ) 28 , 29 . Paused RNAPolII is released into productive elongation via the CDK9 catalytic domain of positive transcription elongation factor 4 ( P - TEFb ) , which phosphorylates serine 2 on the C - terminal domain of RNAPolII as well as NELF and DSIF 25 - 27 . RNAPolII - mediated enhancer RNAs have also been detected at CREs in mammalian cells 30 . Two recent studies demonstrated that short - term RNAPolII degradation can disrupt a subset of E - P loops in steady - state human cell lines 31 , 32 , suggesting a direct link between transcription and loop maintenance . However , the link between cell type - specific E - P and P - P loops and the establishment of new RNAPolII initiation and elongation patterns remains an important unanswered question . Here , we set out to understand the relationship between loops and RNAPolII during the establishment of new transcriptional programs during changes in cell fate . We create genome - wide reference maps of long - range chromatin loops , gene expression , and RNAPolII occupancy during neural lineage commitment in the transitions from human induced pluripotent stem cells ( hiPSCs ) to neural progenitors ( NPCs ) and NPCs to post - mitotic neurons . We uncover a strong link among cell type - specific E - P loops gained de novo during differentiation , RNAPolII elongation , and robust increase of gene expression during human neural lineage commitment . We also demonstrate that loops anchored by elongated genes are particularly sensitive to short term RNAPolII degradation whereas loops anchoring initiated genes bound by CTCF are protected from RNAPolII perturbation . Our work sheds new light into the genome’s dynamic and context - dependent structure - function relationship by linking chromatin loops to transcription elongation during human neural lineage commitment . Results Rewiring of chromatin loops in a human iPSC model of early neural lineage commitment We set out to conduct a genome - wide analysis of long - range chromatin loops in an in vitro human neurodevelopmental model consisting of three cellular stages : ( 1 ) undifferentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells ( hiPSCs ) ( Day 0 ) ; ( 2 ) iPSC - derived neural progenitor cells ( NPCs , DIV35 ) and ( 3 ) post - mitotic cortical neurons ( neurons , DIV65 ) ( Figure 1A ) . We implemented a well - established , multi - stage protocol for growth factor - mediated neuronal differentiation of iPSCs in monolayer tissue culture ( STAR Methods ) 33 , 34 . After confirming the absence of karyotypic abnormalities , we used immunofluorescence and microscopy to evaluate the efficiency of differentiation ( STAR Methods ) . We observed that hiPSCs exhibit homogeneous expression of 5 Figure 1 .

We further observed that NPCs homogeneously express forebrain progenitor markers FOXG1 and NESTIN and that post - mitotic neurons showed homogenous expression of the pan - neural marker MAP2 and layer V - specific marker CTIP2 ( Figure 1B ) . Thus , our hiPSC , NPCs , and neurons 6 homogeneously display the expected morphology and protein markers characteristic of the stage of neural lineage commitment . We assayed higher - order chromatin folding genome - wide by creating Hi - C maps in hiPSCs , NPCs , and neurons . We acquired 396 ( hiPSCs ) , 474 ( NPCs ) , and 426 ( neurons ) million reads for two biological replicates per condition , achieving a read depth sufficient for high - resolution chromatin loop calling ( STAR Methods ) . We merged replicates to create genome - wide ensemble interaction frequency maps for all chromosomes at 10 kilobase ( kb ) resolution . We employed statistical methods developed by our lab and others to identify dot - like structures representative of bona fide loops in ensemble Hi - C data 7 , 35 - 37 . Dots are characterized in Hi - C maps as punctate groups of adjacent pixels with significantly higher contact frequency compared to the surrounding local topologically associating domain ( TAD ) and subTAD structure . We identified 17 , 178 loops in hiPSCs , 12 , 827 loops in NPCs , and 14 , 752 loops in neurons ( Table S1 , STAR Methods ) . We verified that our loop calls were robust across a sweep of parameters 37 and verified by visual inspection of Hi - C heatmaps ( Figure 1C ) . We previously developed a statistical method , 3DeFDR , to identify loops with invariant or cell type - specific interaction frequency between two biological conditions 36 . To quantify changes in looping genome - wide , we used 3DeFDR to compare hiPSC to NPC conditions and NPC to neuron conditions ( Figure 1C - E ) . We found 9 , 145 hiPSC - specific loops , 5 , 348 NPC - specific loops , and 6 , 800 invariant loops between the hiPSC to NPC transition ( Figure 1D - E top , Table S2 ) . We further identified 2 , 311 NPC - specific loops , 4 , 231 neuron - specific loops , and 11 , 304 invariant loops for the NPC - to - neuron transition ( Figure 1D - E bottom , Table S3 ) . Our cell type specific and invariant loop calls were confirmed by visual inspection of Hi - C heatmaps . At the ADCY2 locus we found loops that were decommissioned ( prototypical hiPSC - specific loops ) and gained de novo ( prototypical NPC - specific and neuron - specific loops ) upon differentiation ( Figure 1C ) . Aggregate Peak Analysis ( APA ) plots of average interaction frequency validated our invariant and cell type - specific loop calls across both hiPSC to NPC and NPC to neuron transitions ( Figure 1E , STAR Methods ) . Together , these results demonstrate that differentiation of hiPSCs into NPCs and neurons results in substantial rewiring of loops genome - wide . Classifying genes into repressed , initiated , and elongated RNAPolII occupancy 7 We next set out to classify genes at isoform resolution by their signature patterns of RNAPolII occupancy . It is well established that repressed genes will exhibit minimal to no RNAPolII signal , initiated genes will exhibit strong peak - like signal at the TSS and minimal signal at the gene body , and elongated genes will exhibit an RNAPolII peak at the TSS as well as domain - like signal across the gene body 27 , 38 . We generated RNAPolII ChIP - seq libraries in hiPSCs , NPCs , and neurons ( STAR Methods ) . To stratify genes into repressed , initiated , and elongated categories , first we merged genes with the same TSSs and TESs into transcriptional units , thus circumventing redundancies due to shared TSSs . We next quantified ( 1 ) the maximum RNAPolII signal in a window from - 2kb to the TSS , ( 2 ) the mean RNAPolII signal across the gene body normalized by gene length , and ( 3 ) the mean signal within a window at the gene’s 3’ end that is proportional to the size of the transcriptional unit normalized by base pairs ( Figures 2A - B , detailed in the STAR Methods ) . We verified that the computational strategy is effective in parsing repressed genes devoid of RNAPolII signal , initiated genes with an RNAPolII peak at the promoter and depleted of signal along the gene body , and elongated genes with high RNAPolII signal at the TSS and in a domain - like occupancy pattern along the gene body ( Figure 2C , Table S4 ) . Thus , we have classified repressed , initiated , and elongated transcriptional units across all three cell types . We next assessed CTCF occupancy patterns at the promoters of repressed , initiated , and elongated genes . Using CTCF ChIP - seq in hiPSC , NPCs , and neurons , we intersected the 2 kb segment upstream of all classified TSSs with CTCF peaks ( Figure 2C , Table S5 ) . Across the three cellular stages , we observed that less than 20 % of promoters for repressed transcriptional units are occupied by CTCF . Promoters of initiated and elongated transcriptional units exhibit increases in CTCF occupancy compared to repressed genes . Our observations suggest that promoter occupancy of the architectural protein CTCF increases during the transition from repressed to initiated , but no substantial increase in genome - wide promoter occupancy occurs during the transition from initiation to elongation . Thus , it is unlikely that CTCF binding at the promoter alone could distinguish between initiated and elongated genes . We sought to verify the elongated gene group by measuring their mRNA levels with bulk RNA - seq . We further stratified non - redundant , unique transcriptional units by those that were elongated only in hiPSCs , only in NPCs , or only in neurons ( Figure 2D ) . We found that hiPSC - specific elongated transcriptional units exhibited significantly higher mRNA levels in 8 Figure 2 .

Similarly , we found that NPC - specific elongated transcriptional units had significantly higher expression in NPCs ( µ = 940 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 711 < μ NPC < 1169 ) compared to hiPSCs ( µ = 522 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 373 < μ hiPSC < 671 ; MWU , p = 5 . 5 x 10 - 8 ) and neurons ( µ = 673 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 493 < μ neuron < 852 ; MWU , p = 8 . 2 x 10 - 3 ) . neuron - specific elongated transcriptional units exhibited significantly higher expression in neurons ( µ = 2019 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 1719 < μ neuron < 2319 ) compared to hiPSCs ( µ = 706 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 582 < μ hiPSC < 830 ; MWU , p = 1 . 1 x 10 - 28 ) and NPCs ( µ = 1009 ; 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 884 < μ NPC < 1135 ; MWU , p = 2 . 8 x 10 - 7 ) ( Figure 2E ) . All three groups of cell type - specific elongated genes showed the expected ontology for each cellular state ( Figure 2F ) , thus verifying our approach for stratifying elongated genes by RNAPolII occupancy . Dynamic RNAPolII occupancy during hiPSC - to - NPC and NPC - to - neuron cell fate transitions Terminal differentiation of proliferating NPCs to post - mitotic neurons represents a unique cell fate transition in which chromatin is no longer subjected to the cell cycle . Focusing first on the NPC - to - neuron transition , we characterized genes into categories indicative of dynamic RNAPolII occupancy during cell fate transitions , including : ( i ) repressed ( NPCs ) to initiated ( neurons ) , ( ii ) initiated ( NPCs ) to elongated ( neurons ) , ( iii ) elongated ( NPCs ) to repressed ( neurons ) , and ( iv ) constitutively repressed in both NPCs and neurons ( Figure 3A - E ) . We confirmed that the transcriptional units constitutively repressed in the NPC - to - neuron transition displayed minimal RNAPolII occupancy ( Figure 3A ) and negligible mRNA levels ( Figure 3E ) . Genes that transition from repressed - to - initiated during the NPC - to - neuron transition gained a RNAPolII peak at the promoter in neurons ( Figure 3B ) . Moreover , genes that transition from initiated - to - elongated gained a pronounced domain - like pattern of RNAPolII signal along the gene body in neurons along with a significant upregulation in mRNA levels ( Figures 3C - E ) . We also identified a group of genes displaying occupancy patterns consistent with RNAPolII decommissioning from elongation in NPCs to minimal RNAPolII occupancy in neurons , and these genes exhibit the expected downregulation in 10 Figure 3 . Dynamic RNAPolII occupancy patterns during the cell fate transition from human NPCs to post - mitotic neurons .

P - values , two - tailed Mann Whitney U ( MWU ) test with significance based on ɑ = 0 . 01 . 11 mRNA levels ( Figures 3D - E ) . Such patterns were not restricted to the NPC - to - neuron transition , as the same RNAPolII occupancy and gene expression patterns for all four gene classes were similarly identified in the hiPSC - to - NPC transition ( Figure S1A - E ) . Taken together , these data uncover gene classes with distinct dynamic RNAPolII occupancy patterns during hiPSC - to - NPC and NPC - to - neuron cell fate transitions . Genes transitioning from initiated to elongated during neural differentiation are strongly enriched for gained cell type - specific looping interactions To understand the link between loops and RNAPolII occupancy , we stratified promoters of unique transcriptional units into those that are anchoring any NPC - specific ( Class I , blue ) , Neuron - specific ( Class 2 , green ) , mixed ( Class 3 , yellow ) , cell type - invariant ( Class 4 , dark grey ) chromatin loops and those not engaged in any looping interactions ( Class 5 , light grey ) ( Figure 4A , Figure S2 , STAR Methods ) . At baseline , 29 . 5 % of constitutively repressed transcriptional units connect in cell type - specific or invariant loops , whereas a striking 79 . 2 % of initiated - to - elongated transcriptional units connect in cell type - specific or invariant loops during the NPC - to - neuron transition ( Figure 4B first vs . third barplot , Figure S2 ) . Transcriptional units transitioning from repressed - to - initiated exhibit equal probability of looping versus not looping to distal enhancers ( Figure 4B , second barplot ) . By contrast , transcriptional units transitioning from initiated - to - elongated are > 4 - fold more likely to form cell type - specific loops versus repressed transcriptional units ( Figure 4B , third barplot ) . Our data indicate that the majority of transcriptional units with RNAPolII occupancy patterns indicative of elongation anchor invariant or cell type - specific loops , whereas RNAPolII initiation occurs with similar likelihood in transcriptional units that loop or do not loop . A noteworthy observation is that both initiated and elongated genes are enriched for cell type - specific chromatin loops which arise de novo during neural differentiation . We observed that 22 . 3 % of transcriptional units transitioning from repressed - to - initiated RNAPolII occupancy ( Figure 4B , second barplot ) and 33 % of transcriptional units transitioning from initiated - to - elongated RNAPolII occupancy ( Figure 4B , third barplot ) gain neuron - specific loops that form de novo during the NPC - to - neuron transition ( e . g . green Class 2 neuron - specific loops ) . By contrast , only 7 . 5 % of transcriptional units constitutively repressed in the NPC - to - neuron transition engage in neuron - specific class 2 loops ( Figure 4B , first barplot ) . Example neuron - specific loops gained 12 in the NPC - to - neuron transition can be observed at the SV2C gene classified as transitioning from repressed to initiated ( Figure 4C ) and the PCSK2 gene classified as transitioning from initiated to elongated ( Figure 4D ) . We observed similar trends during the iPSC - to - NPC cell fate transition ( Figure S3A - E , Figure S4 ) . Our data suggest that transcriptional units are 3 - 4 - fold more likely to engage in cell type - specific chromatin loops when they are initiated or elongated compared to repressed during hiPSC - to - NPC and NPC - to - neuron cell fate transitions . Genes transitioning from elongated to repressed during neural differentiation are strongly enriched for decommissioned cell type - specific looping interactions We also examined the relationship between loops and genes transitioning from elongated - to - repressed during NPC - to - neuron differentiation . Transcriptional units that are elongated in NPCs and lose RNAPolII occupancy in neurons are strongly enriched in loops that are decommissioned in neurons ( e . g . blue Class 1 NPC - specific loops ) ( Figure 4B ) . Specifically , we observe that 28 . 9 % of decommissioned transcriptional units also lose loops , which is 6 . 5 - fold higher than the 4 . 3 % of repressed transcriptional units that engage in Class 1 NPC - specific loops ( Figure 4B , fourth barplot , blue ) . Loop decommissioning is exemplified at the BOC gene classified with an elongated - to - repressed RNAPolII occupancy pattern ( Figure 4E ) . Taken together , we observe that the establishment of new cell type - specific loops correlates with transitions into initiated and elongated RNAPolII and the decommissioning of loops correlates with the loss of RNAPolII occupancy during neural differentiation . Genes transitioning from repressed - to - initiated exhibit slight increases in mRNA levels independent of loop status We next set out to distinguish between cell type - specific E - P and P - P loops for their relationship to RNAPolII and mRNA levels . We stratified the NPC - specific , neuron - specific , and invariant loops from Figure 4A and iPSC - specific , NPC - specific , and invariant loops from Figure S3 into the subset connecting enhancers to promoters ( E - P loops ) ( Figure 5A - C , Figure S5 , Figure S6 , Figure S7A - C ) and those connecting promoters to other promoters ( P - P loops ) ( Figure 5D - F , Figure S5 , Figure S6 , Figure S7D - F ) . We integrated E - P and P - P loops with genes classified by changes in RNAPolII occupancy and examined mRNA levels for both hiPSC - to - NPC ( Figures S6 - S7 ) and NPC - to - neuron ( Figures 5 and S5 ) transitions ( STAR Methods ) . 13 Figure 4 . Genes transitioning from initiated - to - elongated are > 4 - fold more likely to form cell type - specific loops than repressed genes . ( A ) Schematic depicting promoters of unique transcriptional units classified as anchoring NPC - specific loops ( Class 1 , blue ) , neuron - specific loops ( Class 2 , green ) , mixed loops ( Class 3 , yellow ) , cell type - invariant loops ( Class 4 , dark grey ) , or not looping ( Class 5 , light grey ) .

( C - E ) Hi - C heatmaps during NPC - to - neuron differentiation ( C ) the SV2C gene illustrating RNAPolII occupancy characteristic of the repressed - to - initiated cell fate transition , ( D ) the PCSK2 gene illustrating RNAPolII occupancy characteristic of initiated - to - elongated genes , ( E ) the BOC gene illustrating RNAPolII occupancy characteristic of elongated - to - repressed transition . Tracks below Hi - C heatmaps show RNAPolII and CTCF ChIP - seq data . Several observations were revealed by our integrative analyses . First , for transcriptional units transitioning from repressed - to - initiated RNAPolII occupancy patterns , we observed a slight 14 increase in mRNA levels whether the transcriptional units engaged in cell type - specific E - P loops , invariant E - P loops , or did not loop ( Figure 5A , Figure S7A ) . We also observed slight increases in mRNA levels whether the transcriptional units engaged in E - P or P - P loops ( Figure 5D , Figure S7D ) . Trends were similar in both the hiPSC - to - NPC and NPC - to - neuron transitions ( Figure 5 , Figure S7 ) . Our data suggest that the recruitment of RNAPolII to the TSS in the repressed - to - initiated transition during neural differentiation can occur independent of looping status . Genes transitioning from initiated - to - elongated exhibit robust mRNA upregulation primarily when connected in cell type - specific enhancer - promoter loops We next examined genes transitioning from initiated - to - elongated RNAPolII occupancy . We observed a striking upregulation of mRNA levels for those connected in cell type - specific E - P loops ( Figure 5B , Figure S7B , second column ) . Similar patterns of mRNA upregulation did not occur for initiated - to - elongated genes when connected in P - P loops , invariant E - P loops , or not looping ( Figure 5B , Figure S7B , fourth column ; Figure 5E , Figure S7E , second column ) . Observations were similar in both the hiPSC - to - NPC and NPC - to - neuron transitions ( Figure 5 , Figure S7 ) . Together these data indicate that although genes transitioning from repressed - to - elongated exhibit slight increases in mRNA levels independent of looping status , the transition from initiation - to - elongation correlates with significantly higher levels of steady state mRNA levels when the transcriptional units are engaged in cell type - specific E - P loops during neural differentiation . Decommissioning from elongation to repression can involve the breaking of cell type - specific E - P loops and can also occur when genes do not engage in loops We also investigated genes transitioning from elongated - to - repressed RNAPolII occupancy . We observed downregulation of mRNA levels whether the transcriptional units engaged in decommissioned cell type - specific E - P loops or did not loop ( Figure 5C , Figure S7C , first barplot ) . We did not find consistent decreases in mRNA levels when decommissioned genes engaged in invariant E - P loops or P - P loops ( Figure 5E , Figure S7E ) . Similar trends were observed in the iPSC - to - NPC and NPC - to - neuron transitions ( Figure 5 , Figure S7 ) . These results demonstrate that the decommissioning from productive elongation can involve the breaking of cell type - specific E - P loops and can also occur when the genes do not engage in loops . 15 Figure 5 . Upregulation of mRNA levels is highest for elongated genes engaged in de novo cell type - specific enhancer - promoter loops during NPC - to - neuron differentiation .

( D - F ) These three transcript classes are stratified into those that ( column 1 ) anchor NPC - specific promoter - promoter loops decommissioned in differentiation ( Class 1 , blue ) , ( column 2 ) anchor neuron - specific promoter - promoter loops gained de novo in differentiation ( Class 2 , green ) , ( column 3 ) anchor cell type - invariant promoter - promoter loops ( Class 4 , dark grey ) , and ( column 4 ) do not loop and lack enhancers within a 80kb vicinity of the TSS ( Class 5 , light grey ) .

Red boxes highlight conditions with sample sizes sufficient to assess trends . Short - term RNAPolII degradation disrupts loops anchored by elongated genes Finally , we sought to functionally test our observation of a strong correlation among RNAPolII elongation , mRNA levels , and cell type - specific loops between enhancers and promoters of elongated genes . We re - analyzed published Micro - C data from the DLD - 1 cell line in which an auxin - inducible degron was used to degrade RNAPolII 32 . Using published RNAPolII ChIP - seq 39 and CTCF CUT & Tag 32 data in the same DLD - 1 cells , we stratified transcriptional units into those with or without CTCF promoter occupancy and exhibiting repressed , initiated , and elongated RNAPolII occupancy patterns ( Figure 6A - C ) . We found that similarly to our NPC and neuron model system , 6 % of repressed , 46 % of initiated , and 64 % of elongated transcriptional units genome - wide have CTCF bound at the promoter in DLD - 1 cells ( Figure S8 ) . We also called loops ( N = 24 , 358 ) genome - wide in Micro - C data in control DLD - 1 cells without auxin ( STAR Methods ) . Focusing on transcriptional units at the base of loops , we found that 27 % of repressed transcriptional units , 68 % of initiated transcriptional units , and 76 % of elongated transcriptional units have at least one CTCF peak at the promoter ( Figure S8 , Figure 6A - C ) . Transcriptional units with CTCF at the promoter are more likely to anchor loops than those without CTCF ( Figure S8 ) . Loops anchoring repressed and initiated transcriptional units exhibit negligible to slight changes in interaction frequency upon lost RNAPolII occupancy , respectively ( Figure 6A - B ) . By contrast , we observed a striking decrease in interaction frequency of loops anchoring elongated genes upon degradation of RNAPolII occupancy ( Figure 6A - C ) . Elongated transcriptional units 17 devoid of CTCF are particularly susceptible to loop disruption upon RNAPolII degradation ( Figure 6C ) . These results further reinforce that RNAPolII is necessary for the maintenance of full loop interaction frequency , particularly for elongated genes that do not have CTCF bound at the promoter . Figure 6 . The interaction frequency of loops anchored by elongated genes devoid of CTCF occupancy at their promoter is particularly susceptible to disruption upon RNAPolII 18 degradation .

Here , we use a model of human iPSC differentiation to NPCs and neurons and create genome - wide kb - resolution maps of higher - order chromatin folding , gene expression , and RNAPolII occupancy . We uncover an unexpected strong correlation between cell type - specific E - P loops and genes with RNAPolII occupancy patterns indicative of an initiation - to - elongation transition during differentiation . Elongated genes connected in E - P loops gained de novo during differentiation display robust upregulation of mRNA . By contrast , elongated genes anchoring P - P loops , invariant E - P loops , or unlooped exhibit modest to negligible changes in mRNA levels . Moreover , we observe that genes with RNAPolII patterns indicative of repressed - to - initiated and elongated - to - repressed transitions show changes in mRNA levels whether engaged in loops or not looping . Together our data suggest that robust increases in transcription elongation strongly correlate with de novo E - P loops , whereas transcription repression , initiation , or decommissioning can occur whether the genes engage in loops or not ( Figure 7A ) . The link between RNAPolII and looping has been debated , with conflicting results linked to low - resolution datasets or pharmacological agents with non - specific indirect effects 22 , 31 , 32 , 39 - 43 . Most recently , two studies employed a degron to achieve short - term RNAPolII degradation and uncovered a previously underappreciated effect on E - P loop maintenance 31 , 32 . Here , we build on these works by creating genome - wide maps of cell type - invariant and cell type - specific chromatin loops during the transitions from hiPSCs to NPCs and NPCs to post - mitotic neurons . We observe a strong correlation between de novo cell type - specific chromatin loops between enhancers and promoters , transcription elongation , and robust upregulation of mRNA levels . By contrast , we find that genes can transition from repressed - to - initiated RNAPII whether they engage in cell type - specific loops , cell type - invariant loops , or do not loop to distal enhancers . These observations are surprising because they support a hypothesized role for E - P loops in the transition from RNAPolII initiation to elongation . Therefore , we re - analyzed published Micro - C data from an established RNAPolII degron system in a dividing mammalian cell line but taking the steps to stratify gene isoforms among those that are repressed , elongated , and initiated . We demonstrate that loops anchored by initiated genes are slightly sensitive to RNAPolII degradation , but only when the promoter is CTCF - independent . CTCF - bound initiated promoters anchor loops that are protected 20 against disruption by RNAPolII knock - down ( Figure 7B ) . By contrast , the sensitivity of chromatin loops to RNAPolII degradation is particularly strong when anchored by elongated promoters regardless of CTCF occupancy ( Figure 7B ) . Our observations reinforce that RNAPolII causally contributes to the strength of loops anchored by elongated genes . The models by which transcription start sites ( TSSs ) communicate with distal CREs to spatiotemporally regulate transcription remain hotly debated when CREs and TSSs are separated by kb to Mb of DNA . One leading model is the formation of stable long - range E - P loops in which promoter activity depends on sustained enhancer proximity via tethering 19 , 44 - 47 . A second leading “kiss - and - run” model involves the transient interaction of CREs with their target TSS 48 . Transient E - P contacts could in principle deposit persistent information on the TSSs to facilitate transcription , such as post - translational protein modifications , chromatin modifying enzymes , or Pol II itself . E - P loops would be important for transcription but ensemble Hi - C or DNA FISH measurements of interaction frequency might not correlate with bulk mRNA measurements or even correlate temporally with burst size / frequency 49 , 50 . A third model , loop - independent long - range communication , involves the diffusion of biomolecules between the CRE and TSS . Finally , a fourth ‘condensate’ model involves the association of promoters and enhancers within foci representing concentrated subnuclear microenvironments of regulatory enzymes , proteins , and RNAs 51 . It has been proposed that Mediator , Brd4 , and RNA Pol II can form foci – potentially through liquid - liquid phase - separation mechanisms 52 , 53 . Here , we take a step toward gathering data to build evidence toward testing these models . We observe that the large majority of elongated genes connect in invariant or cell type - specific looping interactions , whereas repressed genes do not loop and initiated genes exhibit equal probability of looping or not looping ( Figure 7A ) . Punctate focal dots represent loops detectable in ensemble Hi - C data because they are typically present in a large proportion of cells and are unlikely to be transient . Therefore , our data are not consistent with transient “kiss - and - run” or loop - independent models for transcription elongation . Rather , our analyses suggest that genes with high levels of RNAPolII elongation and robust upregulation of mRNA levels show genome folding patterns in ensemble Hi - C data more consistent with sustained E - P tethering in loops ( model 1 ) . Our data also cannot rule out condensates ( model 4 ) . Because condensates range from 200 - 500 nm in size , they in principle could create local environments of proximal access to similar biomolecules without direct contact 51 . Future causal studies should aim to dissect the causal role for loop extrusion and condensate 21 formation in the loops observed connecting distal enhancers and promoters to transcription elongation . The models governing long - range E - P communication remain an exciting open area , and further perturbative and single cell imaging and genomics studies will garner further insight toward how each model alone or individually impacts gene regulation at the stages of initiation , pausing , and elongation . Altogether , our results highlight a link between transcriptional elongation and cell type - specific E - P chromatin loops and emphasize the importance of future work dissecting the causal role for looping in gene expression regulation during human neural lineage commitment .
