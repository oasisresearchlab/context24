China ABSTRACT : A growing body of evidence has shown that extracellular matrix ( ECM ) stiffness can modulate stem cell adhesion , proliferation , migration , differentiation and signaling . Stem cells can feel and respond sensitively to the mechanical microenvironment of the ECM . However , most studies have focused on classical two - dimensional ( 2D ) or quasi - three - dimensional environment , which cannot represent the real situation in vivo . Furthermore , most the current methods used to generate different mechanical properties invariably change the fundamental structural properties of the scaffolds ( such as morphology , porosity , pore size , and pore interconnectivity ) . In this study , we have developed a novel three - dimensional ( 3D ) scaffolds with different degrees of stiffness , but the same 3D microstructure , that was maintained Page 1 of 43 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 2 by using decellularized cancellous bone . Mixtures of collagen and hydroxyapatite [ HA : Ca 10 ( PO 4 ) 6 ( OH ) 2 ] with different proportions were coated on decellularized cancellous bone to vary the stiffness ( local stiffness : 13 . 00±5 . 55 kPa , 13 . 87±1 . 51 kPa , and 37 . 7±19 . 6 kPa ; bulk stiffness : 6 . 74±1 . 16 kPa , 8 . 82±2 . 12 kPa , and 23 . 61±8 . 06 kPa ) . Micro computed tomography ( µ - CT ) assay proved that there was no statistically significant difference in the architecture of the scaffolds before or after coating . Cell viability , osteogenic differentiation , cell recruitment and angiogenesis were determined to characterize the scaffolds and evaluate their biological responses in vitro and in vivo . The in vitro results indicate that the scaffolds developed in this study could sustain adhesion and growth of rat mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) and promote their osteogenic differentiation . The in vivo results further demonstrated that these scaffolds could help to recruit MSCs from subcutaneous tissue , induce them to differentiate into osteoblasts , and provide the 3D environment for angiogenesis . These findings showed that the method we developed can build scaffolds with tunable mechanical properties almost without variation in 3D microstructure . These preparations not only can provide a cell - free scaffold with optimal matrix stiffness to enhance osteogenic differentiation , cell recruitment and angiogenesis in bone tissue engineering , but also have significant implications for studies on the effects of matrix stiffness on stem cells differentiation in 3D environment .

INTRODUCTION Page 2 of 43 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 3 Different tissues have well - defined elastic moduli ranging from very soft tissues , such as brain ( ~ 1 kPa ) to stiffer tissue like skeletal muscle ( ~ 10 kPa ) , and even higher rigidity found in bone tissue ( ~ 15 MPa ) . 1 , 2 Matrix mechanics have been proven to be an important regulator for cellular behavior and function , including cell adhesion , proliferation , migration and differentiation . 3 - 7 Engler et al . 8 have demonstrated that human mesenchymal stem cells ( MSCs ) can differentiate into neurons , myoblasts , or osteoblasts when they are cultured on collagen - coated polyacrylamide ( PA ) hydrogels with stiffness similar to brain ( 0 . 1 - 1 kPa ) , muscle ( 8 - 17 kPa ) or collagenous bone ( 25 - 40 kPa ) , respectively . Recently , Yang et al . 9 also found that one - week culture of MSCs on rigid surfaces ( 10 kPa ) promotes nuclear runx2 expression that remains active after the surrounding matrix is softened . MSCs can store the information from past physical environments and influence the cells’ fate . This finding is consistent with a recent report by Lee and colleagues , 10 who demonstrated that MSCs remain susceptible to the biophysical properties of the matrix and can redirect lineage specification in response to changes in the microenvironment even after several weeks of culture . It has also been shown that the stiffness of the adhesion matrix for MSCs can adjust the differentiation effects of growth factors such as transforming growth factor - β ( TGF - β ) or vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . 11 , 12 However , most previous studies on the effects of matrix stiffness on cell behavior and function were performed on classical 2D or quasi - three - dimensional environment , which cannot represent the real situation in vivo . The biochemistry , topology and mechanical property in real three - dimensional ( 3D ) microenvironment are much different from those in the conventional 2D condition . 13 , 14 Most cells require cues from a truly 3D environment to form relevant physiological tissues and organs in the body . 15 Page 3 of 43 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 4 In recent studies , changing the matrix density of natural proteins in different positions , 16 using synthetic polymers with tunable cross - linking densities , 17 , 18 and changing the ratios of mixed matrices with varied elasticity , 19 , 20 have been used to generate 3D scaffolds with different mechanical properties . However , these methods invariably change the fundamental structural properties of the 3D scaffolds ( such as morphology , porosity , pore size , and pore interconnectivity ) at the same time . Recently , Huebsch et al . 21 fabricated a model matrix with different stiffness by engineering a synthetic hydrogel extracellular matrix ( ECM ) to examine the commitment of the clonally derived murine MSCs in 3D microenvironments with different rigidities ( 2 . 5 - 110 kPa ) . They found that the osteogenic commitment occurred predominantly at 11 - 30 kPa . It is still a major challenge to build scaffolds with the same 3D microstructure but different degrees of stiffness . The key issue facing 3D matrix mechanics research is how to build a material that has tunable mechanical properties while maintaining the same 3D microstructure . In order to meet this challenge , decellularized cancellous bone was used in this study to maintain the 3D microstructure of scaffold . Mixtures of collagen and hydroxyapatite [ HA , Ca 10 ( PO 4 ) 6 ( OH ) 2 ] with different proportions were coated on the decellularized cancellous bone scaffolds , which can provide different degrees of stiffness on the surface of the scaffolds after lyophilization ( Figure 1 ) . Decellularized tissue has the same structure and composition as natural tissue and has been thought to be an appropriate material for 3D scaffold to provide a desirable cellular microenvironment for several kinds of stem cells . 22 , 23 HA was used in our study due to its high biocompatibility and close similarity in chemical composition with natural bone tissue . Because of the poor mechanical property of pure HA scaffold , HA was mixed with collagen solution . As an important component of bone , collagen has good biocompatibility , low immunogenicity , proper osteoinductive function , 24 and complete biodegradability . In addition , Page 4 of 43 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 5 collagen can protect and support human tissue and the physical property of bone . 25 There is evidence that collagen and HA mixture has appropriate mechanical property for bone repair and the proportion of collagen in the mixed material plays an important role in determining the mechanical property of the collagen / HA matrix . For instance , the Young’s modulus of elasticity ( E ) of the material changes from 62 . 02 kPa to 289 . 98 kPa when the proportion of collagen changes from 0 . 5 % to 2 % , while the proportion of HA is maintained at the same 50 % . 26 Furthermore , collagen / HA coating incorporated into decellularized cancellous bone is expected to modulate the surrounding biological environment to further facilitate osseointegration and mitigate possible adverse tissue responses , including foreign body reaction and implant infection . In this study , 3D scaffolds with different stiffness while having the same 3D microstructures were first prepared . Then , the biological responses of these scaffolds in vitro and in vivo were evaluated in terms of cell viability , osteogenic differentiation , cell recruitment , and angiogenesis . 2 . MATERIALS AND METHODS 2 . 1 . Isolation and culture of rat MSCs . Primary rat MSCs were isolated from the tibias and femurs of 4 - week - old Sprague - Dawley ( SD ) rats weighing 130±10 g ( Animal Center , Daping Hospital , Third Military Medical University , Chongqing , China ) as described previously . 27 All animal experimental procedures were carried out according to the protocols approved by Chongqing University Animal Care and Use Committee . MSCs were isolated by Percoll density gradient centrifugation ( 1 . 073 g / L ) and grown at 37 ºC and 5 % CO 2 in low glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium ( Gibco , USA ) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Gibco , USA ) and penicillin / streptomycin . After 3 days , culture medium was replaced for removal of non - adherent cells . When the cells grew to near confluence , they were washed with phosphate - Page 5 of 43 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 6 buffered saline ( PBS ) and harvested from flasks by 0 . 25 % trypsin / 0 . 01 % EDTA . These cells were subcultured when they reached 75 % - 85 % confluence . Rat MSCs in passages 3 - 4 were used for the following experiments . 2 . 2 . Preparation of collagen / HA composite . The HA power was fabricated from its precursors , calcium nitrate tetrahydrate ( Ca ( NO 3 ) 2 ·4H 2 O , Keshi , China ) and sodium phosphate tribasic ( Na 3 PO 4 ·12H 2 O , Keshi , China ) in our lab , as described previously . 28 Pure collagen type I sponge from bovine tendon was purchased from Shanghai Wingch Chemical Technology Co . Ltd . , China . Collagen solutions at concentrations of 0 . 35 , 0 . 5 , or 0 . 7 wt % were prepared in 0 . 01 M HCl solution . Briefly , the collagen sponge was added into the HCl solution and stirred overnight at 4 ºC . These solutions were subsequently centrifuged to remove air bubbles . Defined collagen solutions were then mixed with a calculated amount of HA powder to prepare 22 wt % mixtures of HA in the collagen solutions under constant stirring by a magnetic stirring apparatus at room temperature for 3 days . 2 . 3 . Preparation of decellularized bone scaffold . The decellularized bone scaffold was prepared by a porcine cancellous bone as previously described 29 , 30 and some improvements were made . Briefly , fresh cancellous bone was harvested from the femoral head of a white swine from a local slaughterhouse ( Shapingba , Chongqing , China ) . To reduce the difference among the different decellularized bone scaffolds , all scaffolds were taken from the same place of the femoral head . The femoral head was soaked with 0 . 9 % saline and was immediately processed under clean condition in laboratory . The samples were cleaned by removing the residual tissues , sectioned into discs ( 10 mm in diameter and 5 mm in thickness ) , rinsed , and immersed in Page 6 of 43 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 7 distilled water overnight at 4 ºC . Then , the samples were decellularized by 1 % Triton X - 100 for 48 h , degreased with methane / methyl alcohol for 24 h , incubated with DNase ( Sigma , USA ) at 37 ºC for 2 h , and then washed in PBS at room temperature under continuous shaking . These scaffolds were immersed in dehydrated alcohol for 4 h to remove the cellular remnants and then washed with a large amount of deionized water for 2 h before being dried . Finally , these scaffolds were stored at - 80 ºC before further applications . 2 . 4 . Coating collagen / HA mixture on decellularized bone scaffold . The prepared scaffolds were dipped in the mixture of different collagen / HA ratios for 6 h and shaken gently . After collagen / HA mixture soaked evenly on the surface of scaffolds , the scaffolds were freeze - dried at - 55 ºC and 15 Pa by the freeze dryer ( Boyikang , Beijing ) for 24 h . Finally , the scaffolds were sterilized by 60 Co γ irradiation ( 25 k Gay ) ( Allanace , Southwestern Radiation Research Center , The Third Military Medical University , Chongqing , China ) and stored at - 80 ºC before further applications . 2 . 5 . Characterization of scaffold . 2 . 5 . 1 . Histology The bone scaffolds were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 48 h . They were demineralized by using 12 % EDTA - 2Na ( Sangon Biotech , China ) for 4 weeks , dehydrated step - wise using ethanol , immersed in xylene , and embedded in paraffin . Paraffin was cut into 7 µm sections and then deparaffinized . The sections were stained with Mayer’s hematoxylin and eosin ( H - E ) ( Beyotime , China ) .

Micro computed tomography ( µ - CT ) The qualitative information of the decellularized bone scaffold architecture was obtained by µ - CT imaging using a microfocus X - ray CT system ( Scanco medical AG vivaCT40 , Switzerland ) . Special software µ - CT v6 . 1 of Scanco medical AG was used to visualize the 2D X - ray section images of the layered scaffolds . Slice increment is 10 . 5 µm . Isotropic slice data were obtained by the system and reconstructed into 2D images . These slice images were compiled and analyzed to render 3D images and used to investigate the interconnectivity of the pores , porosity and distribution of pore size . 2 . 5 . 3 . Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) Decellularized bone scaffolds were fixed in 2 . 5 % glutaraldehyde at room temperature for 24 h . They were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol ( 50 % , 70 % , 85 % , 90 % , 95 % , and 100 % ) , dried at room temperature , sputter - coated with platinum for 40 s , and observed by SEM ( FEI , Holland ) . 2 . 5 . 4 Measurement of the E of the different coatings on 3D scaffolds with atomic force microscope ( AFM ) and uniaxial compression testing The local stiffness of different coatings on three different scaffolds was measured with an AFM ( JPK , Germany ) in contact mode which mounted on an inverted microscope ( Leica , Germany ) . After coated with different proportions of collagen / HA mixtures on decellularized bone scaffolds , these scaffolds were cut into sheets with 1 mm thickness . Samples were probed with a soft silicon nitride quadratic pyramid tip ( 0 . 02 N / m ) ( Olympus , Japan ) . E of the different coatings were obtained from force - indentation profiles using a Hertzian model and sample Page 8 of 43 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 9 Poisson’s ratio of 0 . 5 . In such cases we applied a force with AFM tip at different positions along the scaffold and measured the deflection ( n≥20 ) . The force - distance curves were collected and analyzed using the JPK Imaging Process software to obtain the E of different coatings on 3D scaffolds . The bulk stiffness of three different collagen / HA composites ( cylinder : diameter = 10 mm , high = 5 mm ) was measured by uniaxial compression testing ( n = 5 ) . All tests were carried out by using ELF3330 mechanical testing machine ( Bose , USA ) which was fitted with a 22 . 2 N load cell . Compressive testing was performed at a strain rate of 10 % / 60 s . The compressive modulus was calculated in the strain range from 2 % to 5 % of the stress - strain curve . 2 . 5 . 5 Characterization of collagen type I coated on the scaffolds with different stiffness In order to verify whether that the collagen / HA mixtures have been coated on the scaffolds , the cross - sections of four groups of scaffolds were cut into 10 µm by freezing microtome ( Leica , Germany ) . The sections were incubated with a rabbit anti - collagen I antibody ( Bioss , China ; diluted 1 : 300 ) overnight at 4 ºC in a humidified chamber . The secondary antibody was applied with an Alexa Fluor 488 - labled donkey anti - rabbit IgG ( Molecular Probes , USA ; diluted 1 : 500 ) . Three samples for each group were imaged by the fluorescence microscope ( Olympus IX71 , Japan ) . 2 . 6 . Cells seeding on scaffold in vitro . First , scaffolds were sterilized by 60 Co γ irradiation ( 25 k Gay ) , and then immersed in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium ( Gibco , USA ) for 2 h . Finally , scaffolds were seeded with 20 µL cell suspension containing 4×10 5 cells . Scaffolds were Page 9 of 43 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 10 flipped every 15 min for 1 h to achieve uniform cell distribution . Cell culture was maintained in an incubator at 37 ºC , 5 % CO 2 , and 95 % humidity . The medium was changed every three days . 2 . 7 . Viability of cells seeded on collagen / HA decellularized bone scaffold . The cell viability on decellularized bone scaffold coated with collagen / HA was assessed by live / dead assay . On the third day , the first week and the third week , scaffolds were harvested and incubated in 2 µM calcein AM ( staining for live cells ) and 4 µM ethidium homodimer - 1 ( staining for dead cells ) working solution for 30 min in the dark , as indicated by the manufacturer’s instructions ( LIVE / DEAD Viability / Cytotoxicity Kit , Molecular Probes , USA ) . After washing 3 times with PBS , the fluorescence was visualized using a fluorescence microscope ( Olympus IX71 , Japan ) . 2 . 8 . Subcutaneous implantation . The cylindrical - shaped scaffolds ( 5 mm in diameter by 4 mm in thickness ) were prepared and sterilized by 60 Co γ irradiation ( 25 k Gay ) before implantation . SD rats ( male , body weight 230±5 g ) were individually housed in wire bottom cages in temperature - and light - controlled room . The use of rats conformed to the guiding principles in the Care and Use of Animals for our institute , and was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Chongqing University . The animals were anaesthetized with 7 % chloral hydrate ( 0 . 5 mL / 100 g ) . Four same skin incisions were made along the dorsal midline of each rat . Decellularized bone scaffold without coating , scaffold coated with a low - proportion of collagen ( Col 0 . 35 / HA 22 ) , scaffold coated with medium - proportion collagen ( Col 0 . 5 / HA 22 ) and scaffold coated with high - proportion collagen ( Col 0 . 7 / HA 22 ) were inserted into the subcutaneous pockets at top left corner , top right corner , bottom left corner and bottom right corner , respectively ( four animals for each time point ) . After 1 , 3 , and 6 months , rats were Page 10 of 43 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 11 sacrificed and the implanted scaffolds were removed naturally with the surrounding tissue . Then , the samples were fixed and processed for histology as described below . 2 . 9 . Immunohistochemistry . After culture for 14 and 21 days in vitro and subcutaneous implantation for 1 , 3 and 6 months , samples were harvested . Each sample was fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 48 h at 4 ºC and then decalcified with 12 % EDTA - 2Na ( Sangon Biotech , China ) for 4 weeks . Samples were dehydrated with graded ethanol washes , embedded in paraffin and serial longitudinal sections ( 7 µm in thickness ) which were prepared for histology . Paraffin sections were used for immunostain of osteopontin ( OPN ) with rabbit anti - rat OPN polyclonal antibody ( abcam , USA ; diluted 1 : 300 ) or osteocalcin ( OC ) with rabbit anti - rat OC polyclonal antibody ( Bioss , China ; diluted 1 : 50 ) . Paraffin sections were cut on a microtome and deparaffinized with xylene ( twice for 15 min each ) . Endogenous peroxidase was inactivated with 3 % hydrogen peroxide ( H 2 O 2 ) for 30 min at room temperature . The sections were incubated with a primary antibody overnight at 4 ºC in a humidified chamber . The secondary antibody was applied ( 30 min at 37 ºC ) , carrying horseradish peroxidase and developed according to the manufacturer’s protocol ( IHC staining module , Beijing Zhongshan Biotechnology , China ) . Three samples for each group were analyzed by an inverted light microscope ( Olympus IX71 , Japan ) . Semi - quantitative analysis of the immunohistochemical staining was analyzed using the Image - Pro Plus software . The sum of total area and integral optical density ( IOD ) were measured for 5 samples . The average IOD per area ( IOD / area ) was calculated for each group . 2 . 10 . Immunofluorescence . After subcutaneous implantation for 1 and 6 months , samples were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde , and then decalcified in 12 % EDTA - 2Na for 4 weeks . The Page 11 of 43 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 12 sample was cut in half , and one for paraffin sections and the other for frozen sections . Frozen sections ( 10 µm ) were then subjected to immunofluorescence for antibody of rabbit anti - rat CD29 , CD34 , CD44 , CD90 , CD105 ( Bioss , China ; diluted 1 : 300 ) . The Alexa Fluor 488 - labled donkey anti - rabbit IgG ( Molecular Probes , USA ; diluted 1 : 500 ) was used as the second antibody . DAPI ( 1 mg / mL ) staining was used to reveal the nuclei . 2 . 11 . Statistical analysis . Each experiment was performed at least three times . All data are presented as mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) . Two group comparisons were analyzed using one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) . A p - value of less than 0 . 05 ( p < 0 . 05 ) was considered to be statistically significant , * represented p < 0 . 05 . All calculations were conducted using Origin 8 . 0 software . 3 . RESULTS 3 . 1 . Characterization of the decellularized bone scaffolds . The cancellous bone was decellularized by using a process previously described . 30 These decellularized bone specimens were evaluated by histology . Staining of cell nuclei with hematoxylin shows that the nuclei were almost completely removed from the cells in bone scaffolds ( Figure 2 ) . The natural porous structure and the components of bone were well maintained in decellularized bone . Eosin staining shows that natural bone matrix in the decellularization bone was also reserved . 3 . 2 . Architecture of the decellularized bone scaffolds . SEM micrographs showing the pore architecture and trabecular network of the decellularized bone scaffold ( Figure 3 ) indicate that the scaffold has good natural porous microstructure and 3D interconnectivity . Deeper insight into Page 12 of 43 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 13 the pore architecture was obtained by using µ - CT , which allowed quantitative characterization of pore size , porosity and interconnectivity . The µ - CT and 3D reconstruction image analysis of the decellularized bone clearly demonstrated the pore size distribution in 2D ( Figure 4A ) and the 3D interconnectivity of the porous structure ( Figure 4B ) . From the µ - CT images , the mean pore diameter of the decellularized cancellous bone is found to be 389 . 3±134 . 9 µm and the porosity is 74 . 7 % ( Figure 4C and Table 1 ) , and the mean wall thickness is 107 . 7±35 . 9 µm ( Figure 4D and Table 1 ) . 3 . 3 . Surface morphology of the scaffold and validation of coating . After coating with different proportions of collagen / HA mixtures on the decellularized bone scaffolds , the surface color of the scaffolds changed from faint yellow to white due to the mixture of collagen / HA formed after lyophilization . This result also implied that the collagen / HA mixture has been successfully coated on the decellularized bone scaffold . The architecture of the decellularized bone scaffolds of one sample was evaluated by µ - CT scans before and after coating with different proportions of collagen / HA mixtures ( Figure 5A and Figure 5B ) . After coating with the mixture with the highest collagen proportion ( Col 0 . 7 / HA 22 ) , the mean pore diameter of scaffold was 381 . 7±152 . 8 µm ( Figure 5C ) and the mean wall thickness was 103 . 6±35 . 4 µm ( Figure 5D ) . Before coating with this mixture ( Col 0 . 7 / HA 22 ) , the mean pore diameter of scaffold was 389 . 3±134 . 9 µm and the mean wall thickness was 107 . 7±35 . 9 µm ( Table 1 ) . There was no statistically significant difference in the architecture of the scaffolds before or after coating ( p = 0 . 999 ) ( Table 1 ) . To further verify that the collagen has been successfully coated on the decellularized bone scaffold , collagen type I was detected by immunofluorescence staining ( Figure 6 ) . The results Page 13 of 43 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 14 showed that collagen was successfully coated on the surface of scaffolds , and a gradient of collagen content was formed on these three coating groups . Another indirect method was used to verify whether HA has been successfully coated on the decellularized bone scaffold . Collagen / CaCO 3 composite was prepared and coated on the decellularized bone scaffold by the same methods previously described in the section of materials and methods , in which HA was replaced by CaCO 3 . In the Fourier transform infrared spectoscopy ( FTIR ) results ( Figure S1 ) , the characteristic peak of CaCO 3 was shown at 720 cm - 1 . This result also indicated that HA had been coated on the scaffold on the other hand . 3 . 4 . Mechanical characterization of the scaffold . The local stiffness of different coatings on 3D scaffolds was assessed by AFM . The typical force versus indentation curves obtained from different scaffolds and fitted by Hertz model were shown in Figure S2 . The E of the scaffold coated with a low - proportion of collagen ( Col 0 . 35 / HA 22 ) was 13 . 00±5 . 55 kPa , while the values for medium - and high - proportion were 13 . 87±1 . 51 kPa ( Col 0 . 5 / HA 22 ) and 37 . 70±19 . 60 kPa ( Col 0 . 7 / HA 22 ) , respectively ( Table 1 ) . Compressive elastic modulus of collagen / HA composites with a low - proportion of collagen ( Col 0 . 35 / HA 22 ) was 6 . 74±1 . 16 kPa , while the values for medium - and high - proportion were 8 . 82±2 . 12 kPa ( Col 0 . 5 / HA 22 ) and 23 . 61±8 . 06 kPa ( Col 0 . 7 / HA 22 ) ( Table 1 ) . The proportion of collagen plays an important role in determining the mechanical property of scaffold . 3 . 5 . Cell compatibility of the scaffolds with different stiffness . Live / dead staining can accurately distinguish live cells and dead cells ( Figure S3 ) . Live / dead cell analysis revealed uniform distribution of MSCs throughout the scaffolds in periods of three days , one week and Page 14 of 43 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 15 three weeks , and demonstrated that most of the MSCs were viable after 3 weeks of culture with the expansion medium . MSC morphology underwent some changes in 3 weeks from spindle to round shape , especially on the Col 0 . 5 / HA 22 scaffold ( Figure 7 ) . This result may be due to the influence of matrix stiffness on cell adhesion and spreading in 3D environment . 3D matrix stiffness can change the integrin binding and the reorganization of adhesion ligands , both of which are traction dependent and correlated with the extent of cell adhesion and spreading . H - E staining of cultured scaffolds revealed cell infiltration and distribution after 2 and 3 weeks . In all groups , regions close to the scaffold surface have the greatest cell density ( Figure 8 ) . 3 . 6 . Effects of different stiffness on the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs in 3D scaffolds . In order to evaluate the effects of different stiffness on the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs in 3D scaffolds , the expressions of two specific protein markers ( OPN and OC ) were examined during osteogenic differentiation . The expressions of OPN and OC evaluated by immunohistochemistry on histological sections at weeks 2 and 3 of culture showed an increase of staining in all groups over time ( Figure 8A and Figure 8C ) . After culture for two weeks , the positive immunohistochemical staining of OPN in Col 0 . 7 / HA 22 in higher than other groups ( Figure 8B ) . The positive immunohistochemical staining of OC exhibited a higher staining in Col 0 . 5 / HA 22 and Col 0 . 7 / HA 22 ( Figure 8B ) . After culture for three weeks , the scaffold with the highest stiffness ( Col 0 . 7 / HA 22 ) exhibited significantly higher expressions of OPN and OC than the other groups , suggesting that the stiffness of 3D scaffolds significantly affects the differentiation fate of MSCs ( Figure 8D ) . Page 15 of 43 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 16 3 . 7 . In vivo studies : cell infiltration and immunohistochemical staining of bone proteins OPN and OC . To evaluate the tissue reaction and the effects of 3D scaffold with different matrix stiffness on the behavior and fate of host cells in vivo , scaffolds with different stiffness were implanted into SD rats subcutaneously . After 1 , 3 and 6 months of implantation , histological sections from all groups were examined by H - E staining to detect cell infiltration ( Figure 9 ) . Figure 9 shows that cell density in control group ( decellularized bone scaffold without coating ) was relatively lower than those in the coating groups after one month and 3 months of implantation . Cell densities in all groups after 3 months were higher than their corresponding groups after 1 month of implantation ( Figure 9 ) . After 6 months of implantation , cell density had no significant difference among all groups . Meanwhile , fibrous tissue was formed in each group . After the insertion of scaffolds into the subcutaneous tissue for 6 months , scaffold degradation was observed in our experiments ( Figure 9 ) . The reason for the different degradation rates of four groups of scaffolds may be due to the different numbers of invasive cells in these scaffolds . The histological results indicate that the cells infiltrated into the scaffolds and secreted their own ECM . In addition , immunohistochemical staining of bone proteins OPN and OC was used to evaluate the fates of host cells in the scaffolds with different stiffness in 3D . After 1 , 3 and 6 months of implantation , the expressions of OPN and OC gradually increased with time ( Figure 10 ) . 3 . 8 . Utilization of stem cell makers to identify MSCs in vivo . In order to identify whether there were MSCs in the implantation area , the MSC markers were tested in the present study . There were positive stainings of MSC markers CD29 , CD44 , CD90 and CD105 in each group of scaffold after 1 month of implantation in subcutaneous tissue ( Figure 11 ) . The labeled positive Page 16 of 43 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 17 cells migrated from the subcutaneous microenvironment to the implantation sites , making a “MSC migration flow” . Immunofluorescence staining showed that the MSCs migrated in vivo as cell population instead of individual cells . These results indicate that MSCs moved to the implantation area after the scaffolds were implanted for 1 month . However , the in vivo origin of these MSCs in rat subcutaneous tissue is still unclear . 3 . 9 . Effects of matrix mechanics on vascularization in vivo . In order to evaluate the effects of matrix mechanics on vascularization in vivo , the expression of CD34 was detected by immunofluorescent staining after subcutaneous implantation for 6 months . CD34 is highly expressed on hematopoietic progenitors , as well as endothelial cell . In our preliminary experiments , CD34 had a very good specificity for characterization of vascular endothelial cells in the rat carotid artery ( Figure S4 ) . In Figure 12 , the CD34 - positive cells were detected in all four groups . The distribution of CD34 - positive cells in the control group ( decellularized bone scaffold without coating ) was relatively random . In other three groups , the distribution of CD34 - positive cells showed varying degrees of aggregation . The typical blood vessels appeared in scaffold coated with Col 0 . 5 / HA 22 and scaffold coated with Col 0 . 7 / HA 22 ( Figure 12C and Figure 12D ) . 4 . DISCUSSION In order to study the effects of matrix mechanics on stem cell differentiation under the conditions of the real 3D environment , we have developed a new method to create 3D porous scaffolds with different stiffness while keeping the same 3D microstructures . The source of all scaffolds was from the femoral head to ensure their uniformity . Different proportions of collagen / HA mixtures Page 17 of 43 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 18 were coated on the decellularized cancellous bone scaffold to create different stiffness in 3D . The decellularized cancellous bone scaffolds have a good biocompatibility , and the shape and structure can facilitate cell adhesion and proliferation . After coating of the scaffolds with different collagen / HA mixtures , examination of the viability of MSCs on the scaffolds at timed intervals showed that the collagen / HA coatings had good compatibility . After culture for 3 weeks , the MSCs on the scaffolds showed some changes in morphology ; this may be due to the increase of cell density with the culture time or the occurrence of partial cell differentiation . The pore size of 3D scaffold is an important characteristic feature . 31 Scaffolds with a mean pore size of 325 µm have been considered to be optimal for bone tissue engineering . 32 The average pore diameter of the decellularized cancellous bone scaffold developed in our study was 389 . 3±134 . 9 µm and 381 . 7±152 . 8 µm before and after coating with the highest collagen proportion . This average pore size was close to the optimal pore size for cells attachment , proliferation and migration in bone tissue engineering . The proportion of collagen plays an important role in determining the mechanical property of the matrix . 33 To increase the matrix stiffness , the proportion of collagen in the collagen / HA mixture was increased in our experiment . As shown in Table 1 , the compressive elastic modulus of collagen / HA mixtures were 6 . 74±1 . 16 kPa , 8 . 82±2 . 12 kPa , and 23 . 61±8 . 06 kPa . After the mixtures of collagen / HA with different proportions were coated on decellularized cancellous bone , the local stiffness were 13 . 00±5 . 55 kPa , 13 . 87±1 . 51 kPa , and 37 . 7±19 . 6 kPa . The values of local stiffness for Col 0 . 35 / HA 22 and Col 0 . 5 / HA 22 groups after coating have no significant difference . Huebsch and his colleagues 21 demonstrated that the osteogenic differentiation of the MSCs occurred predominantly at 11 - 30 kPa , especially at 22 kPa in 3D hydrogel . The matrix local stiffness in our experiment was set to facilitate osteogenic differentiation of MSCs . Surface Page 18 of 43 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 19 coating can retain the integrity of macroporous structure of decellularized cancellous bone , and a very thin layer was formed in the interior and exterior of the scaffold . The collagen / HA coatings in the present study can assure no change in the microstructure of the scaffold , while the stem cells can sense the mechanical characteristics of the surface coatings . As expected , our results revealed a strong relation between matrix stiffness and the accumulation of bone matrix proteins , including OC and OPN . OC is a small calcium - binding protein that comprises about 10 % of the total non - collagen proteins in bone and tightly adsorbs onto HA mineral surfaces . Similarly , OPN ( an O - glycosylated phospoprotein ) is a cell - and HA - binding protein synthesized by osteoblasts and is implicated in bone resorption . 34 Our in vitro experiments demonstrated the effects of matrix mechanics on the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs in 3D microenvironment . The expressions of OC and OPN on the decellularized bone scaffolds coated with collagen / HA mixtures were much higher than those in the scaffolds without coating after 2 and 3 weeks of culture . These results may be related to the surfaces stiffness of these scaffolds that the cells can feel directly . The matrix stiffness that the cell can feel and respond to should have a plateau . For example , the characteristic rigidity for NIH3T3 fibroblast cell adhesion on the scaffold surfaces has a plateau of E > 10 kPa . Above this approximate plateau , NIH3T3 fibroblasts show little variation in adhesion characteristic regardless of E . However , below this threshold , fibroblast cells have extraordinary sensitivity to the E value . 33 Similarly , the characteristic of cell differentiation maybe have a plateau for the scaffold stiffness . In our study , the E of control group ( decellularized bone scaffold without coating ) is about 1 . 46±0 . 44 GPa measured by nanoindentation testing ( Agilent Technologies , NANO Indenter G200 , USA ) , which is far beyond the elasticity threshold that MSCs can sense . The elasticity range that MSCs can sense may be decided by the stiffness of the cells themselves . Page 19 of 43 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 20 The present study showed that the differentiation trend of MSCs is partly consistent with the mechanical characteristics of the three scaffolds coated in vitro ( Figure 8 ) . In addition to the role of matrix stiffness , the role of collagen content in different coatings should also be considered in the experiment . Collagen type I , an ECM component of subchondral bone , is of importance for MSCs adhesion , and it may have some effect on MSC fate on the scaffolds with different matrix stiffness . Due to the very low collagen content among the various groups , however , the effect of collagen content can be neglected . In Figure 9 , the H - E staining of histological sections of scaffolds with different stiffness demonstrated that many cells have infiltrated into the scaffolds . We hypothesize that a large number of these cells are MSCs . When the tissue or organ is damaged , the damaged part can release many ‘injured signals’ that can recruit or mobilize MSCs to the site of injury . 35 MSCs can sense inflammation in vivo . 36 These recruited MSCs will regulate inflammatory reaction and promote tissue repair . Our experiments detected the expression of osteogenic markers OPN and OC by immunohistochemical staining to examine whether the recruited MSCs differentiate into osteoblasts . At the same time of implantation , the scaffolds coated with collagen / HA mixtures have higher OPN and OC expressions than the control group , especially at scaffolds coated with Col 0 . 5 / HA 22 and Col 0 . 7 / HA 22 ( Figure 10 ) . Immunofluorescent staining for MSC markers CD29 , CD44 , CD90 and CD105 revealed the migration of endogenous MSCs to the implantation region in all groups ( Figure 11 ) . However , we still know little about the specific origin of these MSCs that migrated into in the implantation region . Therefore , further research is needed to determine the recruitment mechanism of MSCs in vivo and the possible relationship between matrix mechanics and MSC recruitment . Page 20 of 43 ACS Paragon Plus Environment ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 21 One of the major challenges in the scaffold - based tissue - engineered osteogenic grafts is how to rapidly provide sufficient blood supply after implantation . 37 Vascular network formation is known to be regulated by the biophysical signals emanating from the microenvironment such as fluid shear stress . 38 Recently , Wu and his colleagues 39 seeded the human umbilical endothelial cells on scaffolds with varying stiffness to observe the formation of capillaries . Their study revealed that cells formed well - defined networks on compliant gels ( 11 to 36 kPa ) . Further increase in hydrogel rigidity to 78 kPa reduced network assembly significantly . Interestingly , the aggregation of blood vessel - like endothelial cells appeared only in the matrices with stiffness values of 13 . 87±1 . 51 kPa and 37 . 70±19 . 60 kPa in our study ( Figure 12C and Figure 12D ) . Therefore , we conclude that matrix stiffness influences angiogenesis in 3D in vivo environment . This may be the reason why vascular development and bone formation are tightly coupled processes during normal bone healing . 40 In future studies , we need to better control the uniformity of the internal structure of each group of scaffolds . In addition , the static 3D culture , which does not have the provision of nutrition and removal of wastes , limits the long - term culture of stem cells or the induction of their differentiation in vitro . In 3D bioreactor , perfusion and dynamic culture can overcome some limitations ( cellular oxygenation , nutrition delivery and waste removal ) in static 3D culture , by facilitating the exchange of oxygen and nutrients . 41 We need to investigate the effects of fluid shear force and matrix mechanics on stem cell fate . 5 . CONCLUSIONS This study has successfully constructed the 3D scaffolds with different stiffness and the same microstructure by using decellularized bone coupled with different ratios of collagen and HA .

The study also revealed that these scaffolds can recruit MSCs from subcutaneous tissue and induce them to differentiate into osteoblasts . Interestingly , these scaffolds can help angiogenesis in 3D in vivo environment . The 3D scaffolds with different stiffness developed in the present study are promising cell - free scaffolds for bone tissue engineering and future clinical applications .
