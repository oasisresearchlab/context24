Structural basis for the recruitment of proﬁlin – actin complexes during ﬁlament elongation by Ena / VASP Franc¸ois Ferron , Grzegorz Rebowski , Sung Haeng Lee and Roberto Dominguez * Department of Physiology , University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine , Philadelphia , PA , USA Cells sustain high rates of actin ﬁlament elongation by maintaining a large pool of actin monomers above the critical concentration for polymerization . Proﬁlin – actin complexes constitute the largest fraction of polymeriza - tion - competent actin monomers . Filament elongation fac - tors such as Ena / VASP and formin catalyze the transition of proﬁlin – actin from the cellular pool onto the barbed end of growing ﬁlaments . The molecular bases of this process are poorly understood . Here we present structural and energetic evidence for two consecutive steps of the elonga - tion mechanism : the recruitment of proﬁlin – actin by the last poly - Pro segment of vasodilator - stimulated phospho - protein ( VASP ) and the binding of proﬁlin – actin simulta - neously to this poly - Pro and to the G - actin - binding ( GAB ) domain of VASP . The actin monomer bound at the GAB domain is proposed to be in position to join the barbed end of the growing ﬁlament concurrently with the release of proﬁlin .

Ena / VASP proteins share a tripartite domain organization ( Figure 1 ) , consisting of N - and C - terminal Ena / VASP homol - ogy 1 and 2 ( EVH1 and EVH2 ) domains and a central Pro - rich region . The EVH1 domain targets Ena / VASP proteins to focal adhesions , ﬁlopodia and lamellipodia by binding to target proteins containing the consensus sequence ‘FPPPP’ , such as vinculin ( Brindle et al , 1996 ; Reinhard et al , 1996 ) , lamelli - podin ( Krause et al , 2004 ) , zyxin ( Reinhard et al , 1995b ) , migﬁlin ( Zhang et al , 2006 ) and palladin ( Boukhelifa et al , 2004 ) . The Pro - rich region of Ena / VASP binds proﬁlin and the SH3 and WW domains of various signaling and scaffolding proteins , including Abl , Src and IRSp53 ( Gertler et al , 1995 ; Ahern - Djamali et al , 1999 ; Krugmann et al , 2001 ) . The EVH2 domain comprises globular and ﬁlamentous actin - binding sites ( GAB and FAB ) , as well as a C - terminal coiled - coil ( CC ) region that mediates VASP tetramerization ( Bachmann et al , 1999 ; Walders - Harbeck et al , 2002 ) . Ena / VASP functions primarily as an actin ﬁlament elonga - tion factor , whereas it is a relatively weak nucleator ( Bear et al , 2002 ; Barzik et al , 2005 ) . Thus , depletion of Ena / VASP produces shorter and more densely branched ﬁlament net - works , whereas its overexpression causes the opposite effect ( Skoble et al , 2001 ; Bear et al , 2002 ) . Since proﬁlin – actin constitutes the major pool of polymerization - competent actin in eukaryotic cells ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) , ﬁlament elon - gation by Ena / VASP will depend upon its ability to ‘process’ proﬁlin – actin complexes for their incorporation onto the barbed end of growing ﬁlaments . Consistent with this notion , the recruitment of proﬁlin – actin by the central Pro - rich region of VASP enhances Listeria motility ( Chakraborty et al , 1995 ; Kang et al , 1997 ; Geese et al , 2000 , 2002 ; Auerbuch et al , 2003 ; Grenklo et al , 2003 ) . Furthermore , a covalently cross - linked proﬁlin – actin complex , which cannot function as a source for ﬁlament elongation , markedly reduces Listeria motility , and this effect depends on the ability of proﬁlin to interact with the poly - Pro region of Ena / VASP ( Grenklo et al , 2003 ) . Proﬁlin also appears to enhance actin polymerization by increasing the anti - capping activity of VASP ( Barzik et al , 2005 ) . The role of proﬁlin – actin in ﬁlament elongation is not unique to Ena / VASP . Most formins also recruit proﬁlin – actin via their Pro - rich FH1 domain , which increases the rate of ﬁlament elongation ( Kovar et al , 2006 ) . Despite the impor - tance of proﬁlin – actin in ﬁlament elongation , the molecular bases for this function are poorly understood . Here , we investigate the energetics and structural bases for the inter - actions of proﬁlin – actin with the last poly - Pro and the poly - Pro - GAB regions of human VASP . Based on the results , we propose a model for the recruitment and processing of proﬁlin – actin complexes during ﬁlament elongation by Ena / VASP . Results The Pro - rich region of Ena / VASP consists of three distinct poly - Pro sites To better understand the modular organization of VASP , and in particular that of its Pro - rich region , we analyzed the distribution of clusters of hydrophobic amino acids using the program HCA ( Callebaut et al , 1997 ) ( Figure 1 ) .

Two small clusters , displaying a characteristic helical pattern ( Callebaut et al , 1997 ) , correspond to the GAB and FAB domains . The ex - tended Pro - rich region located between the EVH1 and GAB domains lacks hydrophobic clusters and is therefore pre - dicted to be mostly unfolded . Although this region is more divergent , we identify three distinct groups of proline resi - dues that are present in all members of the Ena / VASP family ( Figure 1 ) . The ﬁrst group , amino acids 116 – 135 ( human VASP sequence numbers ) , consists of a mixture of proline and hydrophobic amino acids , a signature feature of SH3 - and WW - binding sequences . Thus , programs such as iSPOT ( Brannetti and Helmer - Citterich , 2003 ) and SCANSITE ( Obenauer et al , 2003 ) predict that this poly - Pro site binds the SH3 domains of a number of signaling proteins , including Abl , Nck , Crk and cortactin . The interactions of Ena / VASP with some of these proteins have been demonstrated ( Gertler et al , 1995 ; Sparks et al , 1996 ; Coppolino et al , 2001 ) , although not always mapped speciﬁcally to this site . Because this site does not correspond to a canonical proﬁ - lin - binding sequence ( Perelroizen et al , 1994 ; Petrella et al , 1996 ; Kang et al , 1997 ) , and since it is most likely involved in regulation , we identify it as the ‘regulatory’ poly - Pro site . The second group of proline residues ( amino acids 160 – 194 ) comprises three repeats of the speciﬁc proﬁlin - binding se - quence GPPPPP ( or GP5 ) , and has therefore the potential to bind multiple proﬁlin – actin complexes ( Mahoney et al , 1999 ) . For this reason , we identify this site as the ‘recruiting’ poly - Pro site . Most of the studies on the proﬁlin – poly - Pro interaction have focused on this GP5 region or plain poly - Pro sequences ( Perelroizen et al , 1994 ; Reinhard et al , 1995a ; Petrella et al , 1996 ; Kang et al , 1997 ; Lambrechts et al , 1997 ; Jonckheere et al , 1999 ) . The third group of proline residues is located between the recruiting poly - Pro site and the GAB domain , and is ﬂanked on both sides by short ﬂexible linkers rich in Gly residues . Because of its location , immediately N - terminal to the GAB domain , and its apparent role in deliver - ing proﬁlin – actin from the poly - Pro region to the GAB domain ( see below ) , we identify this site as the ‘loading’ poly - Pro site . The loading site is highly conserved among all members of the Ena / VASP family , and always presents a hydrophobic amino acid at the penultimate position , most commonly Leu ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . The loading poly - Pro site and the GAB domain are the central focus of this study . Binding of proﬁlin and proﬁlin – actin to the loading poly - Pro site of VASP As mentioned above , various studies have investigated the binding of proﬁlin to plain poly - Pro sequences and GP5 sequences of the kind found in the recruiting site of VASP ( Perelroizen et al , 1994 ; Reinhard et al , 1995a ; Petrella et al , 1996 ; Kang et al , 1997 ; Lambrechts et al , 1997 ; Jonckheere et al , 1999 ) . In particular , proﬁlin has been reported to bind the GP5 sequence of VASP with relatively low afﬁnity ( K D of 84 – 250 m M ) ( Petrella et al , 1996 ; Kang et al , 1997 ) . However , neither the binding of proﬁlin to the highly conserved loading poly - Pro site nor the binding of proﬁlin – actin to any poly - Pro sequence has yet been investigated . Here , we used two different methods , isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) and intrinsic tryptophan ﬂuorescence , to measure the binding afﬁnities of both proﬁlin and proﬁlin – actin for a 16 - aa synthetic peptide ( 198 GAGGGPPPAPPLPAAQ 213 ) containing the loading poly - Pro site of human VASP ( Figure 2 ; Supplementary Figure 2 ) . Both methods consistently showed that the binding of proﬁlin – actin for this peptide in high ionic strength buffer is 6 - to 11 - fold higher afﬁnity than that of proﬁlin alone ( K D of 7 . 5 – 8 m M for proﬁlin – actin vs 50 – 84 m M for proﬁlin alone ) . Although not speciﬁcally addressed here , similar results were obtained for a GP5 triplet peptide , resulting in a K D of 23 m M for proﬁlin – actin vs 230 m M for proﬁlin alone ( data not shown ) . We also found that the afﬁnity of proﬁlin for actin in G - buffer increases twofold when proﬁlin is bound to the loading poly - Pro peptide of VASP ( K D of 0 . 8 vs 1 . 6 m M ) ( Supplementary Figure 3 , and Figure 1 Modular organization of VASP . The diagram shown on the upper part of the ﬁgure represents the modular organization of the human VASP sequence ( UniProt P50552 ) based on the distribution of clusters of hydrophobic amino acids determined with the program HCA ( Callebaut et al , 1997 ) . Symbols are as follows : Pro , ; Gly , E ; Thr , & and Ser , . Amino acids are colored according to their chemical characteristics : green , hydrophobic ; red , negatively charged ; blue , positively charged ; black , Ala and Cys . The EVH1 and CC domains , which are stably folded and whose structures have been determined ( Prehoda et al , 1999 ; Kuhnel et al , 2004 ) , are characterized by a higher density of clusters of hydrophobic amino acids ( contoured black ) . In contrast , the extended Pro - rich region ( amino acids 116 – 213 ) lacks hydrophobic clusters , and is predicted to be mostly unfolded . Within this region , we identify three distinct groups of Pro residues , which are present in all members of the Ena / VASP family : regulatory site ( 116 – 135 ) , recruiting site ( 160 – 194 ) and loading site ( 201 – 211 ) . Finally , the region preceding the CC domain has the typical HCA pattern of an inducible a - helix .

Together , these results suggest that poly - Pro sequences bind preferentially proﬁlin – actin than proﬁlin alone . This ﬁnding may have important functional implica - tions , since proﬁlin – actin constitutes the major pool of poly - merization - competent actin in cells , and the afﬁnities determined here for poly - Pro sequences fall within the in - tracellular range of concentrations of proﬁlin – actin ( 5 – 40 m M ) ( Condeelis , 1993 ; Stossel , 1993 ; Kang et al , 1999 ; Dickinson and Purich , 2002 ; Dickinson et al , 2002 ; Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) . Structure of proﬁlin – actin bound to the loading poly - Pro site of human VASP Crystal structures of proﬁlin bound to decameric and penta - decameric L - Pro peptides have been determined ( Mahoney et al , 1997 , 1999 ) . These structures revealed that proﬁlin , like SH3 domains ( Feng et al , 1994 ) , binds plain poly - Pro sequences in two distinct backbone orientations . It was proposed at the time that non - Pro residues in proﬁlin ligands may dictate the actual polarity and register of binding ( Mahoney et al , 1999 ) . These two factors , polarity and register , become particularly important if there is , as we speculate , a mechanism whereby proﬁlin – actin complexes are transferred directly from the last poly - Pro site to the GAB domain of Ena / VASP during ﬁlament elongation . To test this hypothesis , we determined the structure of the ternary com - plex of proﬁlin – actin bound to the 16 - aa peptide correspond - ing to the loading poly - Pro site of human VASP . In the structure , determined to 1 . 8 - A˚ resolution ( Table I ) , actin and the VASP peptide bind on opposite sides of the proﬁlin molecule ( Figure 3A ; Supplementary Figure 4A ) . The con - formation of skeletal a - actin is very similar to that of b - actin in the structure of its complex with proﬁlin determined previously to 2 . 55 - A˚ resolution ( Schutt et al , 1993 ) . In particular , in both structures the nucleotide cleft is in the closed conformation , different from the open cleft conforma - tion suggested by another study ( Chik et al , 1996 ) . Compared to other actin structures , the two proﬁlin – actin complexes also display a slightly closed target - binding cleft , consisting of the cleft between actin subdomains 1 and 3 ( Dominguez , 2004 ) . This effect , which appears to be directly linked to the binding of proﬁlin , may explain the increased afﬁnity of the GAB domain for proﬁlin – actin compared with actin alone ( Chereau and Dominguez , 2006 ) . One noticeable difference between the two proﬁlin – actin structures occurs in the DNase I - binding loop , which is disordered in the ternary complex studied here , but was visualized in the original structure of proﬁlin – b - actin ( Schutt et al , 1993 ) . Also , the C - terminal Phe 375 of actin is rotated around the main chain backbone B 180 1 between the two structures . This amino acid is at the center of the proﬁlin – actin interface , an area that is strictly conserved between a - and b - actin , and which is very well deﬁned in the electron density map ( Supplementary Figure 4B ) . The conformation of proﬁlin is also very similar in the two structures , except for the binding interface of the VASP peptide ( Figure 3C ) , where the side chains of residues His 133 , Ser 137 and Tyr 139 adopt different rotamer orientations . The N - terminus of proﬁlin also forms part of the binding interface and moves in the current structure toward the VASP peptide , making contacts with it . The ﬁrst three amino acids of the loading poly - Pro peptide are disordered in the structure , whereas the remaining 13 ( Gly 201 – Gln 213 ) are all very well deﬁned in the electron Table I Crystallographic data and reﬁnement statistics Proﬁlin – actin – poly - Pro Proﬁlin – actin – poly - Pro - GAB Diffraction statistics Space group P 2 1 2 1 2 1 C 2 Cell parameters a , b , c ( A˚ ) 37 . 47 , 75 . 46 , 180 . 74 119 . 09 , 56 . 59 , 75 . 23 a , b , g ( deg ) 90 . 0 , 90 . 0 , 90 . 0 90 . 0 , 104 . 75 , 90 . 0 ResolutionTotal ( A˚ ) 47 . 09 – 1 . 8 35 . 05 – 1 . 5 Outer shell ( A˚ ) 1 . 86 – 1 . 8 1 . 55 – 1 . 5 Completeness ( % ) 98 . 1 ( 97 . 7 ) 99 . 1 ( 98 . 2 ) Redundancy 7 . 0 ( 5 . 9 ) 8 . 3 ( 7 . 5 ) Unique reﬂections 47041 ( 4579 ) 76002 ( 7370 ) R - merge a ( % ) 7 . 6 ( 34 . 5 ) 7 . 1 ( 29 . 4 ) Average I / s 28 . 1 ( 5 . 7 ) 32 . 44 ( 7 . 8 ) Reﬁnement statistics R - factor b ( % ) 15 . 8 15 . 6 R - free c ( % ) 20 . 1 19 . 0 R . m . s . deviations Bond length ( A˚ ) 0 . 013 0 . 015 Bond angles ( deg ) 1 . 402 1 . 701 Average B - factor All atoms ( A˚ 2 ) 14 . 92 10 . 84 Actin / proﬁlin / VASP ( A˚ 2 ) 13 . 18 / 14 . 26 / 28 . 82 9 . 13 / 7 . 17 / 12 . 34 Solvent atoms ( A˚ 2 ) 23 . 29 22 . 5 PDB code 2PAV 2PBD GAB , G - actin - binding domain ; VASP , vasodilator - stimulated phos - phoprotein .

Figure 2 Binding of proﬁlin and proﬁlin – actin to the loading poly - Pro site of VASP . Binding of the VASP peptide ( 198 GAGGGPPP APPLPAAQ 213 ) produces a signiﬁcant change in the intrinsic tryp - tophan ﬂuorescence of proﬁlin alone ( & ) and proﬁlin – actin ( & ) . In this experiment , the concentration of proﬁlin and proﬁlin – actin was 5 m M and the concentration of the VASP peptide varied for 0 – 320 m M ( see Materials and methods ) . Each data point corresponds to the average of ﬁve independent measurements . Least - square ﬁtting of the data , using a single - site binding model , resulted in dissociation constant ( K D ) estimates of 84 and 7 . 5 m M for proﬁlin and proﬁlin – actin , respectively . Recruitment of proﬁlin – actin by Ena / VASP F Ferron et al & 2007 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 26 | NO 21 | 2007 4599 density map ( Figure 3B ) . The orientation of the VASP peptide is both unambiguous and unique , with the C - terminal end of the peptide pointing toward actin ( Figure 3A ) . The interac - tions with proﬁlin are limited to the eight amino acids between Pro 203 and Pro 210 , and include stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions with proﬁlin residues Trp 3 , Asn 9 , Trp 31 , His 133 and Tyr 139 ( Figure 3C ) . Proﬁlin Tyr 6 also plays a critical role in the interaction , making both a hydrogen - bonding contact with a main - chain atom and a hydrophobic stacking interaction with Leu 209 of the peptide . The conformation of the VASP peptide is signiﬁcantly different from the two backbone conformations of the deca - meric L - Pro peptide , but somewhat similar to that of the pentadecameric L - Pro peptide studied previously ( Mahoney et al , 1997 ; Mahoney et al , 1999 ) ( Supplementary Figure 5 ) . However , important differences occur , which correlate with substitutions of some of the Pro residues in the all - Pro pentadecameric peptide by non - Pro residues in VASP . Thus , although the N - terminal portions of the two peptides super - impose well , the chains diverge slightly after Ala 206 , and this effect becomes more pronounced after Leu 209 of the VASP peptide . In about 50 % of Ena / VASP sequences , Ala 206 is replaced by Pro ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) and this sub - stitution is unlikely to have any major effect in the general conformation of the complex . However , Leu 209 is strictly conserved and is also found in WASP ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . The role of this Leu residue appears to be twofold ; it determines the orientation of the C - terminal portion of the loading poly - Pro region ( toward actin ) , and also determines the register and polarity of the interaction . As we demon - strate next , these factors are in turn critical in deﬁning the position of the GAB domain C - terminal to the loading poly - Pro site so that it can bind to actin . Structure of proﬁlin – actin bound to the loading poly - Pro - GAB region of VASP We had previously shown that proﬁlin – actin binds the GAB domain of VASP with higher afﬁnity than actin alone , leading to the proposal that proﬁlin – actin complexes might transition from the loading poly - Pro site to the GAB domain during ﬁlament elongation ( Chereau and Dominguez , 2006 ) . We had also proposed that the GAB domain is related to WH2 and would therefore be expected to bind in the cleft between actin subdomains 1 and 3 ( Chereau et al , 2005 ) . However , an important question remained ; the structures of WH2 – actin indicated that the binding sites for proﬁlin and WH2 partially overlap and a conformational change would be necessary if the two were to bind actin simultaneously ( Chereau et al , 2005 ) . To test this hypothesis we determined the 1 . 5 - A˚ resolution crystal structure of the ternary complex of proﬁ - lin—actin , with a 43 - aa peptide comprising the loading poly - Pro and GAB domains of human VASP ( residues Gly 202 – Ser 244 ) ( Figure 4A ) . The length of the VASP peptide was deﬁned on the basis of the structures of the loading poly - Pro region described above ( Figure 3 ) , and that of the WH2 of WASP bound to actin ( Chereau et al , 2005 ) , ensuring that none of the amino acids involved in interactions with proﬁlin and actin were excluded . This ternary complex crystallized in a different space group than that of the loading poly - Pro site ( Table I ) , yet the proﬁlin – actin portions of the two structures are very similar . Differences in three loops of actin ( amino acids 199 – 203 , 241 – 247 and 322 – 329 ) can all be attributed to different crystal packing contacts . The electron density map is generally very well deﬁned , and includes two portions of the VASP peptide , amino acids Gly 202 – Ala 212 ( loading poly - Pro site ) and Ala 222 – Ser 238 ( GAB domain ) ( Figures 4B and C ) . The conformation and interactions of the loading poly - Pro site are very similar to those described above ( Figures 3C and 4B ) . The only noticeable difference is that in this structure the loop Tyr 24 – Pro 28 of proﬁlin moves toward the peptide and makes one additional hydrogen - bonding contact with it . As anticipated , the GAB domain binds roughly at the same site as the WH2 of WASP ( Figure 4D ) . Both domains consist of an N - terminal helix that binds in the cleft between actin subdomains 1 and 3 , and a C - terminal extended region that binds along the actin surface , climbing toward the pointed end of the actin monomer . Based on this observation , the GAB domain of Ena / VASP can be unambiguously classiﬁed as a WH2 domain . However , comparison of the structure with those of WH2 and T b domains determined in the absence of proﬁlin ( Hertzog et al , 2004 ; Chereau et al , 2005 ; Lee et al , 2007 ) also reveals important differences . Thus , the helix of the GAB domain is rotated B 45 1 and shifted forward half a helical turn ( Figure 4D ) . These changes add to a displacement of the GAB domain away from proﬁlin , whereas proﬁlin is unaffected . It is unclear if these changes can all be attributed to the presence of proﬁlin , since the sequence of the GAB domain contains some important differences compared to classical WH2 domains . In particular , the helix of the GAB domain is only two turns long , interrupted at the N - terminus by a combination of Gly and Pro residues , whereas in most Figure 3 Crystal structure at 1 . 8 - A˚ resolution of the ternary com - plex of proﬁlin – actin with the loading poly - Pro site of human VASP .

Recruitment of proﬁlin – actin by Ena / VASP F Ferron et al The EMBO Journal VOL 26 | NO 21 | 2007 & 2007 European Molecular Biology Organization 4600 WH2s the helix is at least one turn longer and would be expected to conﬂict with proﬁlin ( Figure 4D ) . Despite these differences the interaction of the helix of the GAB domain presents the same hydrophobic character as the helices of other actin - binding proteins that commonly bind in this cleft ( Dominguez , 2004 ) . Thus , VASP residues Leu 225 and Ile 229 , on the hydrophobic side of this helix , face the hydrophobic cleft in actin ( Figure 4E ) . C - terminal to the helix of the GAB domain is the sequence 234 LRKV 237 . This sequence , conserved in all members of the Ena / VASP family ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) , corresponds to the so - called ‘LKKT’ motif found in a number of actin - binding proteins , including thymosin b ( Hertzog et al , 2004 ) , gelsolin ( Irobi et al , 2003 ) and WH2 ( Paunola et al , 2002 ; Chereau et al , 2005 ) . The interactions of the LKKT motif with actin are conserved in these proteins as well as in the GAB domain of VASP . The most important element of this interaction is the binding of VASP residue Leu 234 in a hydrophobic pocket on the actin surface , surrounded by actin residues Ile 341 and Ile 345 ( Figure 4E ) . In the current structure , as well as in the structure of the WH2 of WASP ( Chereau et al , 2005 ) , the amino acids C - terminal to the LKKT motif are disordered and do not appear to interact with actin . Also disordered in the structure is the linker between the poly - Pro and GAB domains , not a surprising result given the high content of Gly residues in this linker ( 213 QGPGGGGAG 221 ) . Since the VASP peptide is not observed as a continuous chain , the possibility exists that two different peptides are bound . However , this is unlikely since the complex was crystallized using an actin – proﬁlin peptide stoichiometry of 1 : 1 . 1 : 1 . 1 ( see Materials and methods ) , and no traces of density are observed in the 1 . 5 - A˚ resolution map that would correspond to the signiﬁcant unbound portions of two peptides . Another possibility is domain swapping of the VASP peptide between symmetry related molecules , although again there is no direct evidence of this in the electron density map . Nevertheless , none of these possibilities change the fact that proﬁlin – actin binds the poly - Pro and GAB domains simultaneously in the structure . Furthermore , the missing amino acids of the linker can be easily modeled along a groove at the proﬁlin – actin interface , so that they span the distance between the two sites ( Supplementary Movie 6 ) . Note also that GAB is followed by FAB , which tethers Ena / VASP to the elongating ﬁlament , thereby directing the incor - poration of proﬁlin – actin from the poly - Pro - GAB onto the barbed end of a speciﬁc ﬁlament ( Figure 5 ) . Discussion Two monomeric actin - binding proteins , proﬁlin and thymo - sin - b 4 , contribute to maintaining a large fraction ( B 50 % ) of the cellular actin in the unpolymerized pool at a concentra - tion ( B 20 – 100 m M ) that is 200 - to 1000 - fold higher than the critical concentration for barbed - end polymerization ( B 0 . 1 m M ) ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) . While free ATP – actin is present in low amounts ( 0 . 1 – 1 m M ) and thymosin - b 4 – actin is polymerization incompetent , proﬁlin – actin ( present at 5 – 40 m M intracellular concentration ) constitutes the main source of actin monomers for polymerization ( Dickinson and Purich , 2002 ; Dickinson et al , 2002 ) . Multiple properties allow proﬁlin to play such a central role in ﬁlament assembly ( dos Remedios et al , 2003 ; Witke , 2004 ; Yarmola and Bubb , 2006 ) ; ( 1 ) proﬁlin catalyzes the exchange of ADP for ATP on actin , which replenishes the pool of ATP – actin monomers Figure 4 Crystal structure at 1 . 5 - A˚ resolution of the ternary complex of proﬁlin – actin with the loading poly - Pro - GAB region of human VASP .

Recruitment of proﬁlin – actin by Ena / VASP F Ferron et al & 2007 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 26 | NO 21 | 2007 4601 ready for polymerization , ( 2 ) it inhibits ﬁlament nucleation , which explains in part the need for nucleation promoting factors , ( 3 ) proﬁlin - bound actin monomers cannot add to pointed ends , but can elongate ﬁlament barbed ends at approximately the same rate as free actin monomers , ( 4 ) proﬁlin competes effectively with thymosin - b 4 for actin , which is due to its greater afﬁnity for actin than thymosin - b 4 and high dissociation constants of their respective com - plexes with actin , and ( 5 ) proﬁlin binds poly - Pro sequences in various cytoskeletal proteins , including the Arp2 / 3 com - plex activator WASP and the elongation factors Ena / VASP and formin . Thus , recruitment of proﬁlin – actin increases the elongation rates of formin ( Kovar et al , 2006 ) and Ena / VASP - dependent Listeria motility ( Chakraborty et al , 1995 ; Kang et al , 1997 ; Geese et al , 2000 , 2002 ; Machner et al , 2001 ; Auerbuch et al , 2003 ; Grenklo et al , 2003 ) . How ﬁlament elongation factors process proﬁlin – actin for its incorporation at the barbed end of the ﬁlament has Figure 5 Model of ﬁlament elongation by Ena / VASP . ( A ) Ena / VASP tetramers are recruited to the sites of active ﬁlament assembly via interactions of the EVH1 domain with FPPPP - containing scaffolding proteins such as zyxin ( Reinhard et al , 1995b ) , vinculin ( Brindle et al , 1996 ; Reinhard et al , 1996 ) , lamellipodin ( Krause et al , 2004 ) , migﬁlin ( Zhang et al , 2006 ) and palladin ( Boukhelifa et al , 2004 ) . These proteins are connected to the plasma membrane directly or via interactions with membrane - binding scaffolding proteins ( indicated by dashed arrows ) . VASP tetramerization and tethering via the EVH1 domain are likely important for processivity in cells ( see Discussion ) . The recruiting poly - Pro site contains multiple proﬁlin – actin binding modules , which may serve to increase the local concentration of actin monomers for assembly . It is unclear if each subunit of Ena / VASP supports the elongation of one ﬁlament or , as shown in the ﬁgure , two subunits per ﬁlament are required ( one per each long - pitch helix ) . ( B ) Close view of the elongation machinery showing three steps of the elongation mechanism ( indicated by black arrows ) : ( 1 ) recruitment of proﬁlin – actin to the poly - Pro regions , ( 2 ) loading of proﬁlin – actin from the last poly - Pro site onto the GAB domain and ( 3 ) ﬁlament elongation ( red arrow ) resulting from the addition of the actin subunit at the barbed end and the release of proﬁlin . Recruitment of proﬁlin – actin by Ena / VASP F Ferron et al The EMBO Journal VOL 26 | NO 21 | 2007 & 2007 European Molecular Biology Organization 4602 remained a mystery . A view commonly held is that the role of the Pro - rich region of Ena / VASP ( as well as formin ) is to increase the local concentration of proﬁlin – actin available for assembly ( Kang et al , 1997 ; Geese et al , 2000 ; Machner et al , 2001 ; Dickinson and Purich , 2002 ; Grenklo et al , 2003 ; Kovar et al , 2006 ) . This work provides evidence for a more active role of the Pro - rich region of Ena / VASP in elongation , by directing the transition of proﬁlin – actin to the GAB domain , from where the actin monomer can join the barbed end of the growing ﬁlament ( Figure 5 ) . Thus , we have shown here that the Pro - rich region of Ena / VASP has a complex organization , consisting of three discrete modules : the regulatory , recruit - ing and loading poly - Pro sites ( Figure 1 ) . While the binding of proﬁlin to poly - Pro sequences of the kind found in the recruiting site had been previously studied ( Petrella et al , 1996 ; Kang et al , 1997 ) , the loading site had not yet been investigated . This site is particularly important since it is highly conserved among all the members of the Ena / VASP family and WASP , and is connected to the GAB domain by a short Gly - rich linker ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . We found that the loading poly - Pro site binds proﬁlin – actin with signiﬁcantly higher afﬁnity than proﬁlin alone ( Figure 2 ; Supplementary Figure 2 ) . The implication of this ﬁnding is that Ena / VASP has the ability to discriminate between polymerization - competent proﬁlin – actin complexes and proﬁlin alone , which could jam the elongation machin - ery . We had previously reported that the GAB domain also has higher afﬁnity for proﬁlin – actin than actin alone ( Chereau and Dominguez , 2006 ) . Therefore , both the loading poly - Pro and GAB domains have a clear preference for proﬁlin – actin . However , the two sites must cooperate , and not compete , for the transfer of proﬁlin – actin from the cellular pool onto the barbed end of the elongating ﬁlament . To test this hypothesis , we determined the high - resolution structures of proﬁlin – actin bound to the loading poly - Pro ( Figure 3 ) and poly - Pro - GAB of human VASP ( Figure 4 ) . Among the main results of the structures are the following : ( 1 ) the conformation of proﬁlin – a - actin in the two structures is very similar to that of proﬁlin – b - actin determined pre - viously ( Schutt et al , 1993 ) , ( 2 ) the presence of non - Pro amino acids in the loading poly - Pro site , and in particular Leu 209 that is conserved in Ena / VASP and WASP , deﬁne the register , polarity and orientation of binding , ( 3 ) these factors are in turn essential in determining the position of the GAB domain , so that it can access its binding site on actin within the proﬁlin – actin complex , ( 4 ) the GAB domain is related to the WH2 of WASP and makes similar interactions with actin , ( 5 ) the GAB domain can bind actin concomitantly with proﬁlin , which requires signiﬁcant repositioning compared with WH2 domains crystallized in the absence of proﬁlin , and most importantly ( 6 ) the loading poly - Pro and GAB domains of Ena / VASP do not compete for proﬁlin – actin , which they can bind simultaneously ( Figure 4 ) . The structures do not provide clear insights as to why the loading poly - Pro binds more tightly to proﬁlin – actin ( Figure 2 ; Supplementary Figure 2 ) . However , compared with other actin structures , proﬁlin produces a slight closure of the cleft between subdomains 1 and 3 , known as the target - binding cleft ( Dominguez , 2004 ) , which may explain the increased afﬁnity of proﬁlin – actin for the GAB domain ob - served previously ( Chereau and Dominguez , 2006 ) . Another possibility is the mutual stabilization of proﬁlin and actin within their complex , making the binding of both the GAB and poly - Pro domains more favorable . This latter effect appears to work both ways , since the afﬁnity of actin for proﬁlin also increases when proﬁlin is bound to the loading poly - Pro peptide of VASP ( Supplementary Figure 3 ) . What is the next step after proﬁlin – actin has been recruited to the loading poly - Pro and GAB domains ? We would like to suggest that the actin monomer bound to the GAB domain is already in contact with the barbed end of the FAB - tethered ﬁlament ( Figure 5B ) . This idea is based strictly on structural constraints imposed by the short length of the linker between the GAB and FAB domains ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) , inde - pendently of where on F - actin the latter binds . However , as noted before ( Chereau and Dominguez , 2006 ) , the FAB domain is related to the C region of WASP and the two appear to be related to WH2 . In other words , the GAB - FAB of Ena / VASP is related to the WH2 - C of WASP , a relationship that extends at both ends to the loading poly - Pro and , to a lesser extent , to the acidic region ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . WH2 domains often occur in tandem repeats ( Paunola et al , 2002 ) and , if this proposal is correct , GAB - FAB and WH2 - C con - stitute specialized forms of tandem WH2 domains , involved in ﬁlament elongation and Arp2 / 3 activation , respectively . FAB would then be expected to bind in the cleft between subdomains 1 and 3 of the last actin subunit at the barbed end of the elongating ﬁlament . The transition of an actin monomer from the GAB domain to the barbed end of the elongating ﬁlament would then trigger a series of events , including the release of proﬁlin and the stepping of Ena / VASP ( Figure 5B ) . What is the driving force of these events ? The mechanism proposed here is generally in agreement with the direct - transfer polymerization model of Dickinson and Purich ( 2002 ) ( Dickinson et al , 2002 ) . According to this model , ATP hydrolysis by actin is the driving force for the processive stepping of actin polymerization - based motors . However , the precise role of ATP hydrolysis in elongation remains contro - versial . While it has been suggested that ATP hydrolysis is required for proﬁlin dissociation ( Romero et al , 2007 ) , other experiments show that ﬁlament elongation rates can exceed the ATP hydrolysis rate by at least 20 - fold ( Blanchoin and Pollard , 2002 ) . Furthermore , phosphate dissociation after hydrolysis is slow ( Carlier and Pantaloni , 1986 ) , implying that a signiﬁcant fraction of the ﬁlament consists of ADP - Pi - actin , which is considered to be structurally and functionally indistinguishable from ATP – actin ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) . Therefore , based on the evidence to date , it is unclear whether ATP hydrolysis or a nucleotide - independent confor - mational change due to the G - to F - actin transition triggers proﬁlin dissociation and Ena / VASP stepping . How does this mechanism apply to all four subunits of the full - length Ena / VASP tetramer ? Although the core of the elongation machinery consists of the poly - Pro - GAB - FAB re - gion ( Figure 5 ) , it is very likely that all the domains of Ena / VASP are necessary for processive elongation in cells ( the exception may be the motility of Listeria , which has evolved different recruitment mechanisms ) . Ena / VASP tetramers are recruited to sites of rapid assembly by interactions of the EVH1 domains with FPPPP - containing proteins such as zyxin ( Reinhard et al , 1995b ) , vinculin ( Brindle et al , 1996 ; Reinhard et al , 1996 ) , lamellipodin ( Krause et al , 2004 ) , migﬁlin ( Zhang et al , 2006 ) and palladin ( Boukhelifa et al , Recruitment of proﬁlin – actin by Ena / VASP F Ferron et al & 2007 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 26 | NO 21 | 2007 4603 2004 ) . Filaments associated with Ena / VASP tend to be unbranched , longer and form crosslinked bundles ( Skoble et al , 2001 ; Bear et al , 2002 ; Svitkina et al , 2003 ) . A tetramer may be more efﬁcient at generating such actin bundles , in particular if the subunits of Ena / VASP work cooperatively , both within and between neighboring tetramers . But more importantly , tetramerization via the CC domain and tethering via the EVH1 domain may enable Ena / VASP to hold on to a particular ﬁlament during processive stepping , by sequen - tially allowing each subunit to release and advance while the others remain attached . Consistent with this idea , recent evidence shows that all the domains of Ena / VASP are re - quired for proper localization and continued polymerization at ﬁlopodial tips ( Applewhite et al , 2007 ) . In particular , the GAB domain was found to play a key role in maintaining ﬁlopodial tip localization , which is consistent with recent evidence that the WH2 of N - WASP transiently tethers actin ﬁlament to the membrane ( Co et al , 2007 ) . Many questions will require further investigation . For instance , it is unclear whether a single subunit of Ena / VASP can support the elongation of a whole ﬁlament , or whether two subunits per ﬁlament are required ( one for each of the long - pitch helices of the ﬁlament ) . It is also possible that cycles of elongation by Ena / VASP alternate with short periods of depolymerization , or backward steps . Finally , we have stressed here the striking resemblance between the loading poly - Pro - GAB - FAB of VASP and the equivalent region in WASP ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . Some of the results obtained here may therefore be applicable to WASP - Arp2 / 3 - mediated branch nucleation . However , there also are important differ - ences , notably that the helix of WH2 is longer than that of the GAB domain ( Figure 4D ) , which may preclude the transfer of proﬁlin – actin from the last poly - Pro of WASP to WH2 . Materials and methods Preparation of proteins and peptides The cDNA encoding for human proﬁlin I was purchased from ATCC , ampliﬁed by PCR and inserted into vector pET29 / T7 ( Novagen ) . BL21 ( DE3 ) competent cells ( Invitrogen ) were transformed with this constructs and grown in LB medium at 37 1 C until the OD at 600nm reached a value of 0 . 6 . Expression was induced by the addition of 1mM isopropyl - b - D - 1 - thiogalactopyranoside and carried out for 4h at 37 1 C . Cells were harvested by centrifugation , resuspended in 10mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 100mM glycine , 100mM NaCl , 1mM DTTand lysed using a French press . The soluble lysate was puriﬁed on an afﬁnity poly - L - proline sepharose column . Proﬁlin was eluted from the column using 30 % ( v / v ) DMSO , dialysed against 10mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 50mM NaCl and concentrated to B 14mg / ml . Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle as described ( Graceffa and Dominguez , 2003 ) . Peptides corresponding to human VASP residues 198 – 213 ( loading poly - Pro ) and 202 – 244 ( loading poly - Pro and GAB domain ) were synthesized on an ABI431 peptide synthesizer and puriﬁed by HPLC ( see Supplementary Figure 1 for sequence information ) . The concentrations of the peptides were determined by amino - acid analysis ( Dana - Farber Cancer Institute , Boston , MA , USA ) . Crystallization , data collection and structure determination The complexes of proﬁlin – actin with the two VASP peptides were prepared by mixing 66 m M actin in G - buffer ( 2mM HEPES pH 7 . 4 , 0 . 2mM CaCl 2 and 0 . 2mM ATP ) with 73 m M proﬁlin ( in 10mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 50mM NaCl ) , followed by the addition of 73 m M VASP peptide ( same buffer as proﬁlin ) . The complexes were stored on ice and used at this concentration during crystallization trials at 4 and 20 1 C . The best crystals of proﬁlin – actin with the loading poly - Pro peptide were obtained at 4 1 C in 4 m l sitting drops , consisting of a 1 : 1 ( v / v ) mixture of protein solution with 200mM sodium formate and 20 % ( w / v ) PEG 3350 well solution . The best crystals of proﬁlin – actin with the poly - Pro - GAB peptide were obtained at 4 1 C in 3 m l sitting drops , consisting of a 1 : 2 ( v / v ) mixture of the protein solution with 150mM DL - malic acid pH 7 . 0 and 18 % ( w / v ) PEG 3350 well solution . The crystals were ﬂash - frozen in liquid nitrogen , using 20 % glycerol as cryoprotectant . X - ray data sets were collected at the BioCARS beamline 14 - BM - C ( Advance Photon Source , Argonne , IL , USA ) . The data sets were indexed and scaled with program HKL - 2000 ( HKL Research Inc . ) . The structures were determined by molecular replacement using the CCP4 program AMoRe and the structure of proﬁlin – b - actin ( Schutt et al , 1993 ) as a search model . Model building and reﬁnement were performed with the program Coot ( Emsley and Cowtan , 2004 ) and CCP4 program Refmac ( Table I ) . Binding of VASP peptide measured by tryptophan ﬂuorescence Binding of the loading poly - Pro peptide of human VASP to proﬁlin and proﬁlin – actin was measured by the change of intrinsic tryptophan ﬂuorescence using a Cary Eclipse Fluorescence spectro - photometer ( Varian ) . The excitation wavelength was set to 295nm and the emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 400nm . The experiments were performed at 20 1 C in 10mM sodium phosphate pH 7 . 4 and 150mM NaCl . The concentration of proﬁlin and proﬁlin – actin in the cell was 5 m M . The VASP peptide was added at varying concentrations ( 0 , 0 . 15 , 0 . 30 , 0 . 6 , 1 . 25 , 2 . 5 , 5 , 10 , 20 , 40 , 80 , 160 and 320 m M ) . Each data point represents the average of ﬁve independent measurements ( Figure 2 ) . Least - square ﬁtting of the data , using a single - site binding model , resulted in dissociation constant ( K D ) estimates of 84 and 7 . 5 m M for proﬁlin and proﬁlin – actin , respectively . Binding of VASP peptide measured by ITC Binding of the VASP peptide to proﬁlin and proﬁlin – actin was also measured using ITC on a VP - ITC instrument ( MicroCal , Northampton , MA , USA ) . To determine D H and K a of association , the VASP peptide , at a concentration of 1mM , was titrated in 10 - m l injections , into 1 . 44ml of 100 m M proﬁlin ( or 80 m M proﬁlin – actin ) . The experiments were all performed at 25 1 C in 10mM sodium phosphate pH 7 . 4 and 150mM NaCl . The duration of each injection was 10s , with an interval of 3min between injections . The heat of binding was corrected for the small exothermic heat of injection , determined by injecting VASP peptides into buffer . Data were analyzed using the MicroCal’s Origin program .
