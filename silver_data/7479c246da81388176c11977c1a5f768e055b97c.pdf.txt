Among other functions , they regulate cancer cells migration through rearranging the extracellular matrix , secreting soluble factors and establishing direct physical contacts with cancer cells . Here , we report that migrating fibroblasts deposit on the substrate a network of tubular structures that serves as guidance cue for cancer cell migration . Such membranous tubular network , hereafter called tracks , is stably anchored to the substrate in a β5 integrin - dependent manner . We found that cancer cells specifically adhere to tracks by using clathrin - coated structures that pinch and engulf tracks . Tracks represent thus a spatial memory of fibroblast migration paths that is read and erased by cancer cells directionally migrating along them . We propose that fibroblast tracks represent a topography - based intercellular communication system capable of steering cancer cells migration . TEASER The migration path of fibroblasts is marked by tubules that act as railways to direct following cancer cell migration . MAIN TEXT Cell migration is fundamental in cancer development as it is linked to tumor cell invasion and formation of metastases ( Fares et al . , 2020 ) . Several chemical and physical cues of the tumor microenvironment were described to regulate cancer cell migration ( Erdogan et al . , 2017 ; Fischer et al . , 2021 ; Oudin & Weaver , 2016 ; Wyckoff et al . , 2004 ) . Fibroblasts , and in particular cancer - associated fibroblasts ( CAFs ) , act on cancer cell migration in several ways , sometimes preventing invasion by building a capsule of extracellular matrix around the tumor ( Zhang et al . , 2013 ) , and sometimes favoring cancer cells escape from the primary tumor by secreting soluble factors ( Erdogan et al . , 2017 ) , modifying the extracellular matrix ( Attieh et al . , 2017 ; Gaggioli et al . , 2007 ) or physically pulling on cancer cells ( Labernadie et al . , 2017 ) . In this latter case , CAFs migration directly influences cancer cells migration . Fibroblasts were shown to deposit a membranous material composed of tubules of plasma membrane emanating from retraction fibers at the cell rear during migration ( Fuhr et al . , 1998 ; Zimmermann et al . , 2001 ) . More recently , coalescence of these tubules into large vesicles termed migrasomes were described in migrating fibroblasts ( Huang et al . , 2019 ; Jiang et al . , 2019 ; Ma et al . , 2015 ) . Migrasomes are short - lived structures that rupture soon after their formation and release their content of signaling molecules to orientate the migration of following cells ( Jiang et al . , 2019 ) . Migrasomes can also be internalized by surrounding cells and thereby transfer regulatory factors they contain to modulate recipient cells fate ( Jiang et al . , 2019 ; Yu & Yu , 2021 ) . While it is proven that fibroblasts can produce migrasomes , it is not clear whether these structures may participate in orienting cancer cell migration . In addition , depending on the cell type , migrasomes are often less numerous than the total amount of membranous tubules left behind by fibroblasts ( Fan et al . , 2022 ) . This opens the possibility that the tubular part of the network also plays a role in directing following cells . Here , we set out to determine if and how membranous materials left on the substrate by migrating CAFs can steer cancer cell migration . RESULTS We observed that immortalized CAFs isolated from a colon cancer patient left behind themselves an extended network of membranous material while migrating on glass ( Movie 1 and Figure 1A ) . The migration path of CAFs evolving in a 3D network of collagen fibers was also decorated by similar membranous structures , indicating that these structures do not only form in artificial 2D setups ( Supp . Fig . 1A ) . This network originated from retraction fibers as the cell moved forwards ( Movie 1 and Figure 1A ) . Pearlation of tubules composing the network was occasionally observed suggesting that tubules are under tension ( Bar - Ziv & Moses , 1994 ) ( Supp . Fig . 1B ) . The network was organized as branches of regular angles pointing in the direction of the CAF that left them on the substrate ( Figure 1B and C ) . Confirming previous findings ( Zimmermann et al . , 2001 ) , we measured by super resolution microscopy that tubules composing this network displayed a very regular width ( Supp . Fig 1C and D ) . We also noticed some rare and large vesicles seemingly connected to the branches ( Figure 1C ) . However , in agreement with the literature ( Ma et al . , 2015 ) , we observed that these vesicles , most likely corresponding to migrasomes , quickly disappeared after their formation while the branched network remained stable for days ( Figure 1C - E ) . We hereafter refer to this remaining network as tracks . Filamentous actin and microtubules were not present in tracks ( Supp . Fig . 2A and B ) . Interference reflection microscopy revealed that tracks deposited on glass by CAFs established very tight contacts with the substrate suggesting that they specifically adhere to it ( Supp . Fig . 2C ) . Thus , we stained CAFs and tracks for different integrins and observed that β5 integrin but not β1 nor β3 integrins accumulated in tracks ( Figure 1F ) . We next observed that integrin β5 knockdown completely abrogated track biogenesis ( Figure 1G and H and Supp . Fig . 2D and E ) . Conversely , β1 depletion or knock - out did not prevent track formation by fibroblasts ( Supp . Fig . 2F - I ) . Of note , β5 - integrin - positive tracks were produced by CAFs from different origins , as well as by mesenchymal stem cells and immortalized mouse osteoblasts ( Supp . Fig . 2J ) . Thus , our results suggest that tracks are adhesive membranous networks anchored to the substrate in an integrin β5 - dependent manner . We next investigated how cancer cells behave upon contacting CAF - tracks . First , we tested a possible role for tracks serving as adhesion cues for cancer cells . For this , CAFs were allowed to deposit tracks on the substrate for 24h . CAFs were then detached using a procedure that left tracks intact on the substrate ( see Material and Method section ) . MDA - MB - 231 cancer cells were then seeded on the CAF - conditioned substrate and imaged to monitor sites of cell spreading relative to the position of tracks . MDA - MB - 231 cells showed a strong preference for adhering in track regions as compared to other areas of the substrate ( Figure 2A and B ) . We also noticed that upon adhering and spreading on tracks , MDA - MB - 231 cells migrated by following the tracks ( Figure 2C and Movie 2 ) . In addition to tracks , CAFs are known to deposit extracellular matrix components that may affect cancer cell adhesion ( Attieh et al . , 2017 ; Erdogan et al . , 2017 ) . However , we noticed that fibronectin was virtually not deposited by CAFs in the low confluency conditions used to visualize tracks ( Figure 2D ) . To exclude the possibility that cancer cells were sensing undetected extracellular matrix deposits , we first allowed CAFs to deposit tracks on collagen - or fibronectin - coated glass - coverslips . The matrix coating slightly reduced the preferential adhesion of cancer cells to tracks regions although the differences were not statistically significant ( Figure 2B ) . This suggests that tracks represent more effective adhesion cues than collagen or fibronectin . To ensure that tracks were sufficient to support adhesion in tracks areas , we next recorded the position of tracks deposited by CAFs before tracks were removed using Cilengitide . Indeed , Cilengitide , a competitive inhibitor of αvβ5 integrin , allowed to specifically detach tracks from the substrate ( Figure 2E and F ) . We observed that MDA - MB - 231 cells did not preferentially spread in regions previously occupied by tracks ( Figure 2B ) . This demonstrates that tracks are required and sufficient for the observed preferential adhesion in tracks areas . Together , our results show that tracks are very potent adhesion cues for cancer cells . We next aimed to determine how cancer cells adhere to tracks . We first monitored the distribution of focal adhesions marked with vinculin or Talin1 in MDA - MB - 231 cells adhering on tracks . Although focal adhesions were present in these cells , they never overlapped with tracks ( Figure 3A and B and Supp . Fig . 3A and B ) . Additionally , the ability of cells to preferentially adhere to tracks remained unchanged upon depletion of Talin1 , an essential component of focal adhesions ( Figure 3C and Supp . Fig . 3C ) . These results suggest that focal adhesions do not regulate cancer cells adhesion on tracks . We recently showed that clathrin - coated structures ( CCSs ) accumulate along collagen fibers where they serve as adhesion structures in an integrin β1 - dependent manner ( Elkhatib et al . , 2017 ) . Because tracks are tubular structures and show a similar diameter to collagen fibers ( Supp . Fig . 1C ) , we hypothesized that CCSs of cancer cells could also serve as adhesion structures to tracks . First , we observed that CCSs of MDA - MB - 231 cells marked with the µ2 - adaptin subunit of the AP - 2 complex strongly accumulated along tracks ( Figure 3D and E ) . Similar CCSs accumulation were observed in HCT116 colon cancer cells adhering on tracks ( Supp . Fig . 3D and E ) as well as in MDA - MB - 231 adhering on tracks deposited by osteoblasts , another type of fibroblastic cells ( Supp . Fig 3F and G ) . We observed that both CCSs lifetime and nucleation rate were increased at cancer cell / tracks contact sites as compared to other areas of the plasma membrane ( Figure 3F and G and Supp . Fig . 3H and I ) . This phenotype is remarkably similar to collagen fibers - pinching CCSs and suggests that CCSs could play a role in cancer cell adhesion to tracks . Indeed , CCSs ablation by knock - down of the CCSs core component AP - 2 strongly reduced the preferential adhesion of MDA - MB - 231 cells to tracks ( Figure 3C ) . However , depletion of clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) did not inhibit preferential adhesion to tracks ( Figure 3C ) . We already reported that CHC , although required for CCSs budding and endocytosis , is not required for the formation of AP - 2 lattices that can serve as adhesion structures to collagen fibers ( Bresteau et al . , 2021 ; Elkhatib et al . , 2017 ) . Our results suggest that CCSs on tracks , similarly to CCSs on collagen fibers , support adhesion to tracks in an endocytosis - independent manner . We next observed by super resolution microscopy that CCSs wrapped around and pinched tracks labelled with β5 - integrin ( Figure 4A and movie 3 ) . We also noticed that some CCSs forming on tracks showed a budded profile and were filled with integrin β5 ( Figure 4B ) , suggesting that CCSs can internalize portions of tracks . Indeed , we observed that tracks progressively disappeared below MDA - MB - 231 cells adhering on them and this was dependent on both AP - 2 and clathrin expression ( Figure 4C ) . Our results suggest that CCSs on tracks experience a transient period of frustration , as reflected by their longer lifetime , but eventually manage to internalize portions of tracks . Actin has been proposed to be recruited at frustrated CCSs that experience difficulties to bud because of mechanical constraints ( Baschieri et al . , 2020 ; Boulant et al . , 2011 ; Jin et al . , 2022 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2006 ; Perrais & Merrifield , 2005 ) . Indeed , we observed that inhibiting actin dynamics with Cytochalasin D resulted in an increased accumulation of stable CCSs along tracks ( Supp . Fig 4A and B ) . In addition , Cytochalasin D incubation prevented tracks disappearance below MDA - MB - 231 cells ( Supp . Fig . 4C and movie 4 ) . Thus , our results suggest that actin dynamics assists CCSs budding on tracks and allows tracks uptake . We next decided to investigate how CCSs are recruited on tracks . We reasoned that some CCS cargos may engage proteins expressed at the surface of tracks . We thus performed mass spectrometry analyses of purified tracks ( see Material and Methods ) to identify potential candidates . First , we observed that the fraction enriched for tracks contained integrin β5 and its partner integrin αv ( Supp . Table 1 ) , which was then confirmed by western blot analyses ( Supp . Fig . 4D ) . Among the identified hits , we focused on plasma membrane - associated proteins involved in cell - cell adhesion . CAFs depleted for these proteins could still deposit tracks , so we seeded cancer cells on these tracks and measured CCSs accumulation on tracks . We observed a reduced accumulation of CCSs along tracks depleted of Thy1 or MFGE8 proteins ( Figure 4D and Supp . Fig . 4E ) . Expression of GFP - tagged Thy1 and MFGE8 in CAFs confirmed that these proteins were present in tracks ( Supp . Fig . 4F ) . Both Thy1 and MFGE8 were reported to bind in trans to the αvβ3 integrin dimer ( Hanayama et al . , 2002 ; Hermosilla et al . , 2008 ; Leyton et al . , 2001 ) . We first confirmed that both MDA - MB - 231 and HCT116 expressed αv and β3 integrins ( Supp . Fig . 5G ) . We next observed that integrin αv knockdown reduced the preferential adhesion of MDA - MB - 231 cells on wild - type tracks ( Figure 4E and Supp . Fig . 4H ) . In addition , we observed that GFP - tagged integrin β3 strongly but transiently accumulated along tracks during cancer cell spreading ( Movie 5 ) . Occasional colocalization between CCSs and GFP - β3 was observed during MDA - MB - 231 cells spreading on tracks ( Figure 4F and G and movie 5 ) . In addition , inhibiting tracks uptake with Cytochalasin D led to an increased and sustained accumulation of GFP - β3 along tracks ( Supp . Fig . 4I and J ) . These latter observations suggest that αvβ3 transiently accumulate along tracks before to be removed through endocytosis , most likely together with portions of tracks . Overall , our results show that αvβ3 in MDA - MB - 231 cells and αvβ3 - interacting receptors on tracks are required for CCSs - dependent cancer cell adhesion to tracks . Our findings suggest that tracks represent adhesion cues for cancer cells . We reasoned that such adhesion cues may also orient cancer cell migration . Fibroblasts perform durotaxis when seeded on substrates presenting non - homogenous rigidities ( DuChez et al . , 2019 ; Lo et al . , 2000 ; Plotnikov et al . , 2012 ) . We first confirmed that CAFs efficiently migrated towards the stiffer end of a rigidity gradient ( Figure 5A and Supp . Fig . 5A and B ) . However , MDA - MB - 231 and HCT116 cells did not durotax on the rigidity gradient but rather migrated randomly ( Figure 5A ) . We also observed that CAFs deposited more tracks on stiff than on soft substrates ( Figure 5B ) . To determine whether tracks can orient cancer cells migration , CAFs were allowed to migrate and deposit track on the rigidity gradient before to be removed . We then seeded cancer cells on the CAF - conditioned rigidity gradient and monitored their migration . We observed that both MDA - MB - 231 and HCT116 durotaxed on the CAF - conditioned gradient ( Figure 5C and D ) . Similar results were obtained when MDA - MB - 231 cells migrated on an osteoblast - conditioned rigidity gradient ( Supp . Fig . 5C and Fig . 5A ) . However , Cilengitide - mediated tracks removal before cancer cells seeding resulted in both cell lines migrating randomly ( Figure 5C and D ) . Thus , we concluded that tracks deposited by CAFs regulate the direction of cancer cells migration . We next tested the role of CCSs in this directed migration assay . We observed that AP - 2 subunit µ2 - adaptin knockdown prevented MDA - MB - 231 cells to durotax on the CAF - conditioned gradient ( Figure 5C ) . However , in line with the non - requirement for clathrin in mediating adhesion to tracks ( Figure 3C ) , CHC - depleted cells still performed durotaxis on the CAF - conditioned gradient ( Figure 5C ) . Collectively , our results show that tracks guide the migration of cancer cells and that this is regulated by CCS - mediated adhesion to tracks . DISCUSSION Overall , our results show that migrating fibroblasts deposit membranous material in the form of tracks and that cancer cells can use these tracks to steer their migration . CCSs play an instrumental role in this process as they are required to adhere to tracks . Collagen fibers and tracks share common traits such as their tubular shape and diameter . The difference , however , is that CCSs cannot internalize collagen fibers because these structures are too long and too rigid to be accommodated into clathrin - coated pits ( Elkhatib et al . , 2017 ) . However , in the case of tracks , which are membranous structures and are thus less rigid than collagen fibers , CCSs can internalize portions of them with the necessary assistance of actin dynamics . Thus , tracks may represent an intercellular communication system that is read and erased by CCSs of following cancer cells . In addition to the tracks described here , and migrasomes that originate from tracks , deposition of secreted extracellular vesicles has been proposed to draw paths for the migration of following cells ( Sung et al . , 2020 ) . Also , paths made of fibronectin deposited by migrating cells were shown to represent self - induced environmental perturbations that influence future cell trajectories ( d’Alessandro et al . , 2021 ) . Thus , migrating cells may assemble different types of paths that influence self and / or neighboring cell migration . We propose that tracks encode a long - lived but erasable spatial memory of CAF migration trajectories that instructs cancer cell migration .

For Western Blot experiments , cells were lysed in ice cold MAPK buffer ( 100mM NaCl , 10 nM EDTA , 1 % IGEPAL ® CA - 630 , 0 . 1 % SDS , 50mM TRIS - HCl pH 7 . 4 ) supplemented with protease and PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor ( ref . 04 906 845 001 – Roche ) . Antibodies were diluted at 1 : 1000 in PBS - 0 . 1 % Tween - 5 % non - fat dried milk . RNA interference For siRNA - mediated depletion , 150 000 cells were plated together with the indicated siRNA ( 30 nM ) using RNAimax ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) according to the manufacturer ' s instruction . Protein depletion was checked after 72 h of siRNA treatment by western blot or immunofluorescence with specific antibodies . To perform depletions of AP2 , Clathrin heavy chain , and Talin1 in MDA - MB - 231 , as well as to perform depletions in CAFs , cells were transfected once as described above and then a second time , 48 hours later , with the same siRNAs . In this case , cells were analyzed 96 hours after the first transfection . The sequences of the siRNAs used are reported in Table 2 . Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy and fluorescence quantification Cells were fixed in ice - cold methanol or 4 % PFA and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy by using the indicated antibodies . For anti - Talin1 staining , cells were briefly pre - extracted for 30 sec using PEM buffer ( PIPES 80 mM , EGTA 5 mM , MgCl2 2 mM . pH 6 . 8 , 1 % TritonX100 ) prior to PFA fixation . Coverslips were mounted with Fluoromount - G ( ref . 0100 - 20 – ref . 0100 - 01 SouthernBiotech ) . Immunofluorescence images were acquired on a Leica Thunder epifluorescence microscope ( Leica Microsystems Ltd . , Wetzlar , Germany ) through 63x ( N . A . 1 . 40 ) , 20x ( HC N . A . 0 . 40 PH1 ) , 10x ( Fluotar N . A . 0 . 32 PH1 ) or 5x ( PLAN 5 / N . A . 0 . 12 PHO ) objectives . The microscope was equipped with LED5 lamp from Leica , a filter cube DFT51010 , an external wheel EFW for DMi8 , and sCMOS K5 camera . A PeCon chamber i8 was installed on the microscope to perform live imaging at 37°C with 5 % CO2 . The microscope was steered by the Leica dedicated LasX software® with Navigator allowing to generate mosaic stitched images . To monitor the stability of tracks over time , cells were plated on 35 mm glass - bottom dishes with grids of 50 µm ( ref . P35G - 1 . 5 - 14 - C - GRID - MatTek Corporation ) . Images were acquired 2 days after cells plating . With the help of the grids , the same regions were imaged 72h later and the number of tracks still present on the surface was quantified . To quantify CCSs and FAs enrichment along tracks , 12 . 000 CAFs were plated on 18 mm diameter coverslips for 48 h , then 60 . 000 genome edited MDA - MB - 231 cells wt , engineered to expressed an endogenous GFP - tagged µ2 subunit , or stably expressing vinculin - GFP were added for 35 minutes . Cells were then fixed with PFA and integrin β5 was stained to visualize tracks . Alternatively , staining against integrin β5 and α - adaptin subunit of AP - 2 or Talin1 was performed . Tracks under MDA - MB - 231 were manually segmented and the fluorescence intensity of CCSs or FAs markers in the region corresponding to tracks was quantified . The masks were then shifted by 10 pixel to calculate the background , non - specific GFP average fluorescence intensity . The ratio between the GFP signal under the tracks vs the GFP signal in the shifted region was used to quantify enrichment of CCSs or FA along tracks . All quantifications on immunofluorescence images were done with FIJI after background subtraction . Acrylamide gels of controlled stiffness Coverslips or glass bottom dishes ( ibidi - ref . 81218 - 200 ) were incubated with APTMS ( 3‐ aminopropyltrimethoxysilane ) for 15 min at RT , then washed extensively with water and incubated for 30 min with Glutaraldehyde 0 . 5 % in PBS and washed again with water . Acrylamide 40 % and bis - acrylamide 2 % were mixed ( respectively 5 % and 0 . 04 % for 0 . 1 kPa gels , 7 . 5 % and 0 . 06 % for 5 kPa gels , 18 % and 0 . 4 % for 31 . 7 kPa gels , and 16 % and 0 . 96 % for 80 kPa ) with PBS , APS 10 % and TEMED . 9 µl of this solution were polymerized on the treated glass . Gels were washed with PBS , followed by a 30 min incubation with 300 μl 50mM Hepes pH 7 . 5 + 100 μl sulfo - sampah ( 1mg / ml in 50mM Hepes pH 7 . 5 ) + 100 μl EDC ( 10mg / ml in 50mM Hepes pH 7 . 5 ) . Gels were subsequently cross - linked under UV light for 10 minutes , washed and incubated with 50 µg / ml collagen - I overnight at 37°C . Elasticity of the different gels was controlled by Atomic Force Microscopy as indicated in ( Betz et al . , 2011 ) The generation of 80 kPa gels was performed according to a previously published protocol ( Cozzolino et al . , 2016 ) . Durotaxis gradients were obtained by placing 4 µl of 0 . 1 kPa solution next to 4 µl of 80 kPa solution on a treated glass - bottom dish . Fluorescent beads of 500 nm diameter ( ref . F8812 - Invitrogen ) were added to one of the two solutions to visualize the gradient . An 18 mm diameter glass coverslip was then quickly placed on top of the droplets , thus allowing for mixing of the two solutions and generation of a rigidity gradient . This method generates rigidity gradients where the stiffness increases linearly for 1 - 2 mm , as verified by AFM . Durotaxis gradients were coated with 50 µg / ml collagen I overnight at 37°C . Imaging was started 5h after cell plating and performed at the center of the gradient which was determined by looking at the fluorescent beads inside the gels . The number of cells plated on a gradient was 50 000 for CAFs and 100 000 for the other cell lines . One fluorescence image was acquired to visualize the fluorescent beads and identify the center of the gradient . Then , videos of 12 - 14 hours were recorded at a frequency of 1 image every 20 min with phase contrast . Cells were manually tracked using the “Manual tracking” plugin of FIJI . Forward Migration Indexes were obtained with the Ibidi “Chemotaxis and Migration Tool” in FIJI . Live cell spinning disk microscopy and quantifications Cells were imaged on a Nikon Ti2 Eclipse ( Nikon France SAS , Champigny sur Marne , France ) inverted microscope equipped with a 60x NA 1 . 40 Oil objective WD 0 . 130 , a sCMOS PRIME 95B camera ( Photometrics , AZ , USA ) and a dual output laser launch , which included 405 , 488 , 561 and 642 nm 30 mW lasers . The emission filters characteristics are as follows 452 / 45nm ( Semrock Part # FF01 - 452 / 45 ) ; 470 / 24 ( Chroma 348716 ) ; 525 / 50nm ( Semrock Part # FF03 - 525 / 50 ) ; 545 / 40nm ( Chroma 346986 ) ; 6986 ) ; ( Semrock Part # FF01 - 609 / 54 ) ; 708 / 75nm ( Semrock Part # FF01 708 / 75 ) . The microscope was steered by Metamorph 7 software ( MDS Analytical Technologies , Sunnyvale , CA , USA ) . For CCS dynamics quantification along tracks , cells were imaged at 1 image every 5 sec for 5 min . Tracks were manually segmented and CCSs lifetime was measured on tracks vs outside tracks using the TrackMate plugin of FIJI . Tracks below 5 seconds of duration ( detected on only 1 frame ) were discarded . To quantify CCSs nucleation , the number of CCSs appearing during the 5 min long video was counted and normalized to the area . At least 1000 tracks from at least 5 cells per condition and per experiments were quantified in 3 - 5 independent experiments . Data are expressed as mean ± SD . Videos of 8 - 12 hours were recorded at a frequency of 1 image every 5 min . When needed , prior to image analysis , videos were realigned either manually or using the Template Matching plugin of FIJI . TIRF microscopy For total internal reflection fluorescent microscopy ( TIRF ) , MDA - MB - 231 cells transfected with the indicated plasmids were imaged through a 100x 1 . 49 NA APO TIRF WD 0 . 13 - 0 . 20 oil objective lens on a Nikon Ti2 Eclipse ( Nikon France SAS , Champigny sur Marne , France ) inverted microscope equipped with a sCMOS PRIME 95B camera ( Photometrics , AZ , USA ) and a dual output laser launch , which included 405 , 488 , 561 and 642 nm 30 mW lasers , and driven by Metamorph 7 software ( MDS Analytical Technologies , Sunnyvale , CA , USA ) . A motorized device ( Piezo electrical XYZ stage from Nikon ) driven by Metamorph allowed the accurate positioning of the illumination light for evanescent wave excitation . Videos of 8 - 12 hours were recorded at a frequency of 1 image every 5 min . When needed , prior to image analysis , videos were realigned either manually or using the Template Matching plugin of FIJI . Interference Reflection Microscopy Images were acquired on a Leica Sp8 confocal microscope with a Pecon incubation chamber equipped with two hybrid and three PMT detectors , using 405 , 488 , 561 and 633 nm lasers and an 85 / 15 cube . Imaging was performed using a 63× objective ( 1 . 4 NA ) and the 633 nm laser was used to have the IRM picture . Fast Fourier Transforms ( FFTs ) of the raw images were obtained in FIJI and used to remove linear interferences . Final images were obtained using the inverse FFT command on FIJI . 3D migration in collagen networks For 3D cell migration assays , a glass - bottom dish was treated with Poly - L - Lysine 0 . 1 % ( Sigma – Ref . P8920 ) for 5 min at RT prior to add a 50 μl droplet of collagen type I ( BD bioscience - 50 : 1 ratio unlabeled vs Alexa548 - labeled ) at a final concentration of 2 . 2 mg / ml mixed with 5 , 000 CAFs CAAX - mOrange cells . Collagen was allowed to polymerize at room temperature for 30 min before to immerge the setup in pre - warmed DMEM supplemented with FCS and ITS . 24h later , cells were imaged by spinning disk microscopy . Proteomic analysis of CAF - tracks CAFs were plated at a density of 40 cells / mm² in six T75 cell culture flasks . After 48 hours of migration , DMEM + ITS + FCS was replaced with DMEM + ITS . 24 h later , Calyculin A was added ( final concentration 20 nM ) for 20 minutes to induce cell detachment from the substrate . Flasks were then washed 5 times with PBS . 3ml of DMEM were added to each flask . Cilengitide , a selective inhibitor of the integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5 , was added to three flasks to harvest tracks ( final concentration 20 µM ) , while DMSO was added to the other three flasks . After 80 min incubation at 37°C , the medium was recovered and centrifuged at 20 . 000g for 30 min . Pellets were then recovered in 20 µl of PBS and subjected to further analysis . Each sample was dried and solubilized in 10 µL of 8M urea , 200 mM ammonium bicarbonate and then reduced in 5 mM dithiothreitol , pH 8 with vortexing at 57°C for 30min . After cooling to room temperature , cysteines were alkylated by adding 10 mM of iodoacetamide for 30 min in the dark . After diluting to 1 M urea with 200 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8 . 0 , samples were digested with 0 . 4µg trypsine / LysC ( Promega ) overnight , with vortexing at 37° . Samples were then loaded onto homemade C18 StageTips for desalting . Peptides were eluted using 40 / 60 MeCN / H2O + 0 . 1 % formic acid , vacuum concentrated to dryness and reconstituted in 10µl or 20µl injection buffer ( 0 . 3 % TFA ) before nano - LC - MS / MS analysis . Online chromatography was performed using an RSLCnano system ( Ultimate 3000 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Peptides were trapped on a C18 column ( 75 μm inner diameter × 2 cm ; nanoViper Acclaim PepMapTM 100 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) with buffer A ( 2 : 98 MeCN : H2O in 0 . 1 % formic acid ) at a flow rate of 3 . 0 µl / min over 4 min . Separation was performed on a 50 cm x 75 μm C18 column ( nanoViper Acclaim PepMapTM RSLC , 2 μm , 100Å , Thermo Scientific ) , regulated to a temperature of 40 °C with a linear gradient of 3 % to 32 % buffer B ( 100 % MeCN in 0 . 1 % formic acid ) at a flow rate of 150 nl / min over 91 min . Full - scan MS was acquired using an Orbitrap Analyzer with the resolution set to 120 , 000 , and ions from each full scan were higher - energy C - trap dissociation ( HCD ) fragmented and analysed in the linear ion trap . For identification , the data were searched against the Homo Sapiens UP000005640 database using Sequest HT through Proteome Discoverer ( v . 2 . 4 ) . Enzyme specificity was set to trypsin and a maximum of two miss cleavages sites were allowed . Oxidized methionine , Met - loss , Met - loss - Acetyl and N - terminal acetylation were set as variable modifications . Carbamidomethylation of cysteins were set as fixed modification . Maximum allowed mass deviation was set to 10 ppm for monoisotopic precursor ions and 0 . 6 Da for MS / MS peaks . False - discovery rate ( FDR ) was calculated using Percolator ( The et al . , 2016 ) and was set to 1 % at the peptide level for the whole study . The resulting files were further processed using myProMS ( Poullet et al . , 2007 ) v . 3 . 9 . 3 ( https : / / github . com / bioinfo - pf - curie / myproms ) . Protein were considered track candidates only if i ) never found in PBS samples and ii ) present in both track replicate with at least 3 peptides in each analysis . The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE ( Perez - Riverol et al . , 2019 ) partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD034091 . Super resolution microscopy 3D STORM For 3D STORM microscopy , immunolabelled cells were prepared on 1 . 5H coverslip using freshly prepared STORM buffer ( Smart Kit , Abbelight , Cachan ) and sealed with a silicon gasket . The sample was imaged through a 100x 1 . 49 NA APO TIRF WD 0 . 13 - 0 . 20 oil objective lens on a Nikon Ti2 Eclipse ( Nikon France SAS , Champigny sur Marne , France ) inverted microscope associated to a SAFe 360 detection module ( Abbelight , Cachan ) combined to two sCMOS Flash 4 v3 camera ( Hamamatsu , Japan ) . Uniform and large field of view TIRF excitation is provided through an ASTER module ( Mau et al . , 2021 ) , which included 405 nm ( LBX - 405 - 50 - CSB - PPA , Oxxius 50 mW ) and 640 nm ( ERROL laser 500 mW ) lasers and a quad band dichroic / emission filter ( Semrock 405 / 488 / 532 / 640 refs . FF01 - 446 / 510 / 581 / 703 - 25 and Di03 - R405 / 488 / 532 / 635 - t1 - 25x36 ) . Acquisition is driven by Neo software ( Abbeligth , Cachan ) and typically between 20000 and 40000 images ( 20 ms acquisition time ) were acquired to reconstruct the final 3D super - resolved images . Two 3D imaging modalities were used . For single protein observation , SAFe detection module was configured for DONALD microscopy ( Bourg et al . , 2015 ) , i . e . the fluorescence image is divided in two imaging path on the two camera by a 50 - 50 % beamsplitter , and intrinsic supercritical angle fluorescence ( SAF ) is used to extract absolute axial position of single molecule events . For simultaneous dual protein observations labelled with CF647 and CF680 , the SAFe module was configured for spectral demixing ( Lampe et al . , 2012 ) , i . e . the fluorescence image is divided in two complementary spectral images by a dichroic with a cut - off wavelength at 700 nm ( Chroma T700lpxr - 3 ) , and axial information is provided by two astigmatic lens in each imaging path ( Cabriel et al . , 2019 ) . 3D STORM analysis including drift correction , axial information calculation ( SAF or astigmatism ) , ratiometric measurements for spectral demixing of CF647 and CF680 , filtering by cluster analysis were performed with Neo analysis software ( Abbelight Cachan ) . Chimerax was repurposed for 3D surface rendering of 3Ddata in Movie 3 ( Pettersen et al . , 2021 ) . Atomic Force Microscopy Spectroscopy force experiments were performed in water with an Icon AFM coupled to Nanoscope V controller from Bruker . The probe was an OTR8 ( Bruker ) with a spring constant of 0 . 61N . m . The system was calibrated according to the manufacturer ' s procedure : spring constant , deflection sensitivity and tip size . The approach / retract curves were acquired with a maximum load of 80 N and at a frequency of 1Hz . The approach / retract curves are processed using software Analysis Nanoscope ( Vers . 2 . 0 Bruker ) . The moduli represent the average of 4 values calculated with the Sneddon model on retract curves . Statistical analyses Graphics were prepared with the open - source software Instant Clue ( Nolte et al . , 2018 ) and Prism V8 . 0 and statistical analyses were performed using Prism V8 . 0 or Instant Clue software .
