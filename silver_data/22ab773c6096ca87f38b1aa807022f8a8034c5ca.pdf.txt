Gray Received : December 9 , 2021 / Accepted : January 18 , 2022 / Published online : February 2 , 2022 (cid:2) The Author ( s ) 2022 ABSTRACT Introduction : EpidemiologiCal POpulatioN STudy of SARS - CoV - 2 in Lake CounTy , Illinois ( CONTACT ) is an observational , epidemiological study with a 9 - month longitudinal follow - up of nonhospitalized persons aged 18 years or older currently living or employed in Lake County , IL . We describe the study design and report baseline characteristics of the study participants , includ - ing the proportion of participants with acute or previous SARS - CoV - 2 infection at enrollment . Methods : At enrollment and subsequent time - points , participants recruited through digital and paper - based advertising campaigns repor - ted their occupational and school - based expo - sure , risk factors , and behaviors , and provided nasal and serum specimens . Stratiﬁed enrich - ment was used to enhance enrollment into medium - and higher - risk groups within four occupational risk groups for SARS - CoV - 2 infec - tion . RT - PCR and serologic ( IgG ) testing were conducted to detect acute or previous SARS - CoV - 2 infection in participants , respectively . Results : Between November 2020 and January 2021 , 1008 participants ( female 70 . 7 % , mean age ± SD 51 ± 13 . 8 years ) completed the ques - tionnaire and diagnostic testing . Among par - ticipants , 41 . 8 % ( n = 421 ) were considered low risk , 24 . 6 % ( n = 248 ) were medium - to - low risk , 22 . 3 % ( n = 225 ) were medium - to - high risk , and 11 . 3 % ( n = 114 ) were high risk . Of 56 ( 5 . 6 % ) participants with evidence of acute or previous SARS - CoV - 2 infection at baseline , 11 ( 19 . 6 % ) were RT - PCR - positive , 36 ( 64 . 3 % ) were IgG - seropositive , and 9 ( 16 . 1 % ) were positive by both assays . Participants who were adherent vs nonadherent to social distancing measures ( odds ratio [ 95 % CI ] 0 . 8 [ 0 . 4 – 1 . 8 ] ) were less likely , while those in higher vs lower occupa - tional risk groups ( 2 . 0 [ 1 . 0 – 4 . 4 ] ) were more Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1007 / s40121 - 022 - 00593 - 0 .

Conclusion : In fall / winter 2020 / 21 , 5 . 6 % of adults in a Lake County convenience sample had evidence for acute or previous SARS - CoV - 2 infection at baseline . Nonadherence to social distancing measures and high - risk professions were associated with SARS - CoV - 2 infection . The study is ongoing and future analyses will assess infection status over time . Clinical Trial Registration : NCT04611230 . Keywords : SARS - CoV - 2 ; COVID - 19 ; Epidemi - ology ; Community - based research Key Summary Points Why carry out this study ? Current understanding of COVID - 19 epidemiology , transmission dynamics , and clinical and demographic characteristics of individuals with SARS - CoV - 2 is continually evolving . Real - world community - based studies are important for understanding population - level drivers of risk and transmission dynamics of the pandemic , and informing future public health policy decision - making . EpidemiologiCal POpulatioN STudy of SARS - CoV - 2 in Lake CounTy , Illinois ( CONTACT ) study is a prospective , longitudinal , community - based study design assessing the proportion of study participants in Lake County , IL with acute or previous SARS - CoV - 2 infection overall and in relation to demographic , occupational , clinical , and behavioral characteristics at baseline . What was learned from this study ? We report on the unique study design of this community - based study and baseline assessment of participants working or residing in Lake County , IL . In this cohort , serologic and RT - PCR assessments showed that 5 . 6 % of study participants had evidence for acute or previous SARS - CoV - 2 infection and nonadherence to social distancing measures and traveling domestically since December 1 , 2019 were identiﬁed as factors associated with SARS - CoV - 2 infection . INTRODUCTION Since ﬁrst appearing in late 2019 , coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) , which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coron - avirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , has spread globally [ 1 , 2 ] . The current understanding of COVID - 19 epidemiology , transmission dynamics , and clinical and demographic characteristics of individuals with SARS - CoV - 2 is continually evolving [ 3 ] . In the USA as well as other coun - tries , SARS - CoV - 2 susceptibility , symptoms , and severity vary by patient demographics , particu - larly age , race , and sex , comorbidities , occupa - tions , behaviors , and clinical characteristics [ 3 – 13 ] . Activities that may inﬂuence exposure and increase risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection include unprotected exposure in social settings , travel history ( between US states and interna - tionally ) , higher - risk occupational environ - ments , and close contact with a person known to be positive [ 14 – 18 ] . Identifying patients who are at higher risk for SARS - CoV - 2 infection is necessary to prioritize screening and transmis - sion prevention measures , as these factors vary by geographical regions [ 19 ] . Real - world com - munity - based studies are important for evalu - ating the effectiveness of interventions , understanding population - level drivers of risk and transmission dynamics of the pandemic , and informing future public health policy decision - making . The COVID - 19 pandemic highlighted the need to develop rapid decentralized clinical and epidemiological evaluations within the USA . Any such epidemiological studies would opti - mally include longitudinal patient assessments . 900 Infect Dis Ther ( 2022 ) 11 : 899 – 911 Here we report on the unique prospective cohort , longitudinal , community - based study design of the EpidemiologiCal POpulatioN STudy of SARS - CoV - 2 in Lake CounTy , Illinois ( CONTACT ) study as well as participants’ base - line characteristics , behaviors , and level of potential occupational or school - based expo - sure , for the study population enrolled between November 2020 and January 2021 . Objectives of this study are to determine the proportion of study participants in Lake County , IL with acute or previous SARS - CoV - 2 infection overall and in relation to demographic , occupational , clinical , and behavioral characteristics at baseline . METHODS Study Design This is a 12 - month ( November 2020 to October 2021 ; including a 3 - month enrollment and 9 - month follow - up ) observational , community - based prospective epidemiological study of persons aged 18 years or older who are currently living or employed in Lake County , IL . Study data , self - reported by participants within the web - based study portal , were collected at base - line , and are being collected at future time - points ( 3 , 6 , and 9 months ± 3 days ) . Participants are also queried via the online questionnaire every other week for self - reported signs and symptoms . Nasal and serum speci - mens , taken by trained healthcare personnel at one of three sites located in Lake County , IL , for molecular ( reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [ RT - PCR ] ) and serologic testing ( immunoglobulin G [ IgG ] seropositivity ) were collected at baseline and are being collected at 3 , 6 , and 9 months ( ± 1 week ) ( Fig . 1 ) . Partici - pants are being followed longitudinally for a 9 - month period . Study Cohort / Sample Selection Recruitment for the CONTACT study was acti - vated through targeted advertisements in Lake County , IL using social media , postcards , and posters in speciﬁc locations , featuring highlights of the study and both the individual and social beneﬁts of participating . To be eligi - ble for the study , participants had to ( a ) provide informed consent , ( b ) be proﬁcient in English or Spanish , ( c ) have access to the web - based study portal , and ( d ) not be hospitalized at the time of enrollment . Attempts were made to enhance enrollment into the higher of four occupational risk groups ( i . e . , minimize the low risk group ) dependent on exposure risks associated with their places of work at enrollment , adapted from Occupational Safety and Health Adminis - tration guidance [ 20 ] . Low risk was deﬁned as jobs that do not require close contact with the general public or coworkers , low – medium risk was deﬁned as infrequent contact with the general public or coworkers , medium – high risk was deﬁned as jobs requiring frequent contact with the general public or coworkers , and high risk was deﬁned as jobs requiring frequent and / or close contact with individuals with high potential risk for exposure to known or sus - pected cases of COVID - 19 . Each occupational risk group was capped at approximately 420 participants with no minimum number of par - ticipants required . The full analysis set contains all enrolled participants who completed the baseline questionnaires and the SARS - CoV - 2 molecular and serologic testing . Data Collection An Electronic Data Capture System was used to capture participants’ self - reported questionnaire data . This system administered the study ques - tionnaires to participants and permitted partic - ipants to schedule visits for specimen sample collection and receive test results . Participants were allowed 3 days for completion of ques - tionnaires and 1 week for completion of speci - men collection from the day the patient agrees to participate . Serologic and molecular SARS - CoV - 2 testing was performed at baseline ( ± 1 week ) and scheduled quarterly at 3 , 6 , and 9 months ( ± 1 week ) . Test results were integrated into the database and available to participants through the web - based study portal . Virtual consultation was provided to participants with positive RT - Infect Dis Ther ( 2022 ) 11 : 899 – 911 901 PCR to aid in interpreting test results . The EuroQol - 5 Dimension - 5 Level ( EQ - 5D - 5L ) questionnaire was used as a measure of health - related quality of life ( HRQoL ) and made avail - able for completion by participants within 2 weeks of testing after each round of sampling . The baseline questionnaire included demo - graphics , occupational exposure , current life - style behaviors including travel history , relevant medical history ( i . e . , comorbidities , respiratory illnesses , and inﬂuenza - like illness or symptoms ) , household exposure , healthcare resource utilization ( HRU ) , and HRQoL ( Fig . 1 ) . Participants are being followed longitudinally , with online symptom questionnaires performed every other week , including concurrently with serologic and molecular SARS - CoV - 2 sampling . Symptoms included in the online symptom questionnaires were based on Federal Drug Administration deﬁned symptoms at the time of the study design [ 21 ] . If a participant tests positive for acute infection or self - reports a COVID - 19 diagnosis , COVID - 19 - related HRU data are collected every other week until symptom resolution . Additionally , changes in household exposures ( i . e . , household family member changed work setting or received COVID - 19 diagnosis ) are captured every other week . At 3 , 6 , and 9 months , participants are asked to complete follow - up questionnaires that capture changes in occupational exposure and current lifestyle behaviors including travel his - tory . Data collection was adjusted to collect vaccine status once the vaccines were available . Baseline Molecular and Serologic Testing Molecular testing was used to determine current infection status and was conducted by qualita - tive RT - PCR according to manufacturer’s instructions , which includes positive and neg - ative controls ( Roche Cobas (cid:3) [ Roche Diagnos - tics , Basel , Switzerland ] ; assay with a reported sensitivity of 100 % and speciﬁcity of 95 . 5 % ) [ 14 ] . Samples for the RT - PCR test were collected by nasal swab . Qualitative results of ‘‘detected’’ and ‘‘presumptive positive’’ were an indication of positive for SARS - CoV - 2 acute infection at baseline . A result of ‘‘not detected’’ was indica - tive of no acute infection at baseline and ‘‘in - valid’’ was considered as missing and excluded from the analysis . Serologic testing to deter - mine IgG seropositivity status was conducted using the qualitative Abbott ARCHITECT SARS - CoV - 2 IgG ( Abbott , IL , USA ) assay with a sen - sitivity of 100 % and speciﬁcity of 99 . 6 % [ 22 – 24 ] . IgG seropositivity ( C 1 . 4 index [ S / C ] cutoff ) was indicative of SARS - CoV - 2 previous infection . A negative serology test ( \ 1 . 4 index . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Vaccination is not expected to confer IgG seropositivity with this assay . Molecular and serologic follow - up testing are scheduled quarterly at 3 , 6 , and 9 months ( ± 1 week ) and utilize the same methodology as baseline testing . Study Objectives Primary Objectives The primary objectives of the baseline analysis presented herein were to determine ( 1 ) the proportion of participants with evidence for previous SARS - CoV - 2 infection at enrollment by either IgG serologic testing or self - reported previous diagnosis at baseline and ( 2 ) propor - tion of participants with evidence of acute SARS - CoV - 2 infection at enrollment via RT - PCR testing . Self - reported diagnosis was deﬁned as the participant reporting a positive test result for SARS - CoV - 2 infection since December 1 , 2019 or having been diagnosed by a healthcare provider with SARS - CoV - 2 infection since December 1 , 2019 . Future analyses of the study aim to describe incident infection ( 3 , 6 , and 9 months ) of SARS - CoV - 2 over time and the association between incident infections over time and variables of interest ( i . e . , baseline characteristics , occupa - tional exposure , and behaviors ) will be exam - ined using multivariable logistic regression modeling . Secondary Objectives Secondary outcomes included the proportions of participants reporting COVID - 19 symptoms prior to enrollment and over time during fol - low - up as well as the proportion of participants reporting hospitalization due to COVID - 19 prior to enrollment and over time for future analysis . Among those reporting prior hospi - talization , hospital length of stay was reported . The proportion of RT - PCR - positive participants reporting symptoms at baseline was reported . Quality Assurance Self - reported data , except for HRQoL data , are collected prior to each specimen sampling to minimize bias . To ensure quality of the testing samples collected , each testing collection site was remotely monitored after the conclusion of each sampling ( baseline , 3 - , 6 - , and 9 - month visit ) . Additionally , testing sites are monitored on a weekly basis to ensure rapid turnaround and delivery of results back to participants . Statistical Analysis This 12 - month study is descriptive and exploratory in nature . Analysis of the primary outcomes for the baseline data presented here was conducted for all participants completing enrollment . Quantitative variables were repor - ted as number of participants with nonmissing value and mean and standard deviation ( SD ) . Categorical variables are summarized as number and percentage of participants with nonmissing values in each category . The proportions of participants with evidence for acute or previous SARS - CoV - 2 infections were reported overall and by occupational exposure risk groups and other covariates of interest , such as demo - graphics , comorbidities , overall symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID - 19 symptoms , household exposure , travel history , and behaviors . Odds ratios ( ORs ) were utilized to explore the associ - ations between covariates and acute or previous infection status . All baseline analyses were conducted using SAS (cid:3) version 9 . 4 ( SAS Institute , Cary , NC , USA ) . Ethics The protocol , informed consent form , and all communications to study participants includ - ing advertising pieces were reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board ( Advarra , Inc ) . All participants provided informed consent prior to completion of ques - tionnaires and specimen collection .

S1 in the supplementary material ) . The study cohort was predominantly White ( 91 . 7 % ) and female ( 70 . 7 % ) , with an average age ± SD of 51 . 4 ± 13 . 8 years ( Table 1 ) . The low workplace exposure risk group ( n = 421 , 41 . 8 % ) was the largest group , followed by medium - to - low risk ( n = 248 , 24 . 6 % ) and medium - to - high risk ( n = 225 , 22 . 3 % ) , while the high - risk group ( n = 114 ) contained 11 . 3 % of all participants ( Table 1 ) . For comorbid conditions at baseline , 10 . 7 % ( n = 108 ) of participants had autoim - mune diseases , 6 . 6 % ( n = 67 ) had cardiovascular diseases ( including 4 . 7 % [ n = 47 ] with hyper - tension ) , 5 . 7 % ( n = 57 ) had lung disease , and 1 . 2 % ( n = 12 ) had active cancer ( Table S1 ) . Seven ( 0 . 7 % ) participants reported having received at least one dose of SARS - CoV - 2 vac - cine at enrollment . Serologic and RT - PCR Testing of Study Population Overall , 56 ( 5 . 6 % ) participants had evidence for acute or previous SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( Table 1 ) , of whom 11 ( 19 . 6 % ) were RT - PCR - positive , 36 ( 64 . 3 % ) were IgG - seropositive , and 9 ( 16 . 1 % ) were RT - PCR - positive and IgG - seropositive . Symptomatic infections presented differently between currently and previously infected participants . Of the 20 participants who had an acute infection , 70 . 0 % ( n = 14 / 20 ) reported one or more COVID - 19 symptom , while only 37 . 8 % ( n = 17 / 45 ) of those with evidence of previous infection reported having had symptoms ( Table 1 ) . Most demographic factors were not signiﬁ - cantly associated with an increased likelihood of having evidence for acute or previous SARS - CoV - 2 infections except race ( other races vs White race ; OR 3 . 8 [ 1 . 9 – 7 . 3 ] ) . Participants of Asian race had evidence of previous infection in higher proportions compared to other , although the number of Asian participants was small ( 4 . 0 % , n = 40 ) ( Table 2 ; Fig . S2 ) . Partici - pants in the higher - risk groups for occupational exposure were slightly more likely to have tes - ted positive for either acute or previous infec - tion in comparison to the low - occupational - risk group ( OR 1 . 3 [ 0 . 6 – 2 . 5 ] , and 2 . 0 [ 1 . 0 – 4 . 4 ] for medium – high , and high - risk groups , respec - tively ) ( Table 2 ; Fig . S2 ) . Social Behavioral Characteristics Household Exposure Most participants ( 88 . 2 % , n = 889 ) lived with others and the mean number of household members was 1 . 9 ± 1 . 4 . Exposure to COVID - 19 at baseline through family members / household exposure is shown in Table S2 .

S4 ) . Quality of Life Assessment The mean HRQoL state , as measured on a visual analog scale from 1 to 100 with higher scores indicating better health status , ranged from 81 . 3 to 84 . 8 , with the lowest scores reported among those who were RT - PCR - positive . Indi - viduals who were RT - PCR - positive had increased anxiety / depression compared with individuals who tested RT - PCR - negative , IgG - seronegative , or IgG - seropositive ( Table S6 ) . DISCUSSION While the use of RT - PCR or serologic testing has formed an important part of many COVID - 19 studies , few analyses have included both as measures of SARS - CoV - 2 positivity on a longi - tudinal basis , with symptomatic questionnaires collected at scheduled testing timepoints and every other week during the study observational period . The use of a prospective cohort study design is also relatively uncommon among SARS - CoV - 2 studies . We estimated the propor - tion of both acute and previous SARS - CoV - 2 infections in a community - based convenience sample of those who live or work in Lake County , IL . The proportion of participants with evidence for acute infection by RT - PCR testing at baseline ( from November 2020 to January 2021 ) observed in this study ( 2 . 0 % , n = 20 / 1008 ) was slightly higher than that observed in Lake County , IL during the same time period ( per 100 , 000 population between November and January [ 0 . 5 – 0 . 9 % ] ) [ 25 ] , which may be reﬂective of the attempts to enhance enroll - ment in the higher occupational risk groups . The percentage of RT - PCR - positive participants among all symptomatic participants ( 15 . 2 % ; n = 14 / 92 ) was comparable to the overall Lake County SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR - positivity rate between November 2020 and January 2021 ( 10 . 1 – 16 . 5 % ) [ 25 ] . These results underscore the reliability of the study methods for community - based recruitment , sample collection , and questionnaire administration . There are poten - tial challenges to recruitment , retention , and data completeness when conducting such a study within a population of mostly asymp - tomatic , voluntary individuals . Strategies such as the use of mobile applications , posters , social media , and mailers within hyper - local cohorts with easy access to on - the - ground recruitment and nearby dedicated study sites were seen as potential success factors and highlight how studies such as this one ( which currently shows a high retention rate of 97 . 1 % at 3 months ) can effectively evaluate community - level transmis - sion dynamics and inform on the epidemiology of the pandemic . To reduce the number of participants lost to follow - up , this study asked participants to provide contact information for another individual who could be contacted if the participant becomes unreachable , permit - ting proxy data collection . Identifying demographic , clinical , and behavioral characteristics associated with SARS - CoV - 2 infection status may help to inﬂuence screening prioritization , risk mitigation strate - gies , and control measures , especially with changes arising from introduction of the vac - cine [ 3 , 5 ] . In the current study , most partici - pants were female and between ages 50 and 64 years . A higher proportion of participants of Asian race were IgG antibody - positive ( i . e . , had previous infection ) compared to other races , though the overall number of participants of Asian race was small ( n = 40 ) and no partici - pants of Asian race had evidence of acute infection at baseline . A recent report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also found a higher proportion of breakthrough infections among Asian participants ( 8 . 3 % vac - cinated vs 3 . 1 % among unvaccinated ) [ 26 ] . Further characterization of risk behaviors and occupational risk groups by race are needed to explain why IgG positivity was more common in participants of Asian race . In our study , similar to ﬁndings from other studies , individ - uals who did not practice social distancing behaviors , who continued to travel , and who were in higher occupational risk groups were more likely to have acute or previous SARS - CoV - 2 infection compared with those who followed 908 Infect Dis Ther ( 2022 ) 11 : 899 – 911 public health measures and were in lower occupational risk groups [ 5 , 9 , 11 , 14 , 15 , 17 , 18 ] . Mitigation measures in place during the majority of the baseline period included virtual schools and masks were required . Planned fol - low - up analyses will provide an opportunity to better understand social distancing behaviors and how they inﬂuence transmission dynamics over time , including the impact of loosening restrictions after the rate of COVID - 19 - positive cases began to slow and vaccine distribution increased . Strengths and Limitations Strengths of the study included the unique longitudinal , prospective , community - based study design , which included serologic and molecular testing as measures of SARS - CoV - 2 positivity on a longitudinal basis with symp - tomatic questionnaires at testing timepoints . The quality assurance measures , speciﬁcally remote monitoring of sites , utilized for the molecular and serologic testing were another strength of this study compared to other com - munity - based studies . All questionnaire data are self - reported by participants and may be subject to differential recall and other reporting biases . Self - reported data , except for HRQoL data , were collected prior to each specimen sampling to reduce differential recall based on infection status . This study is not intended to be repre - sentative , so participants may not be reﬂective of the overall population of Lake County , IL . The gender and racial distribution of our study ( 70 . 7 % female and 91 . 7 % White ) differs from publicly available information of the distribu - tion of those demographics in Lake County , IL ( 50 . 0 % female , 80 . 9 % White , 7 . 5 % Black ) which may be a limitation of the recruitment and convenience sample strategy utilized . Unmea - sured confounding variables , including those related to potential COVID - 19 exposures and participant characteristics , are possible and may inﬂuence the results obtained . The highest - risk group based on age is people older than age 80 years ; however , few participants in this age group enrolled in this study . There were mask requirements , as well as several restrictions on travel , social interaction , attendance of in - per - son schools , and access to public locations , including places of employment , in Lake County during the baseline observation period ; these restrictions may have reduced the poten - tial for occupational exposures to COVID - 19 . CONCLUSION This was a baseline assessment of an ongoing prospective longitudinal cohort study of par - ticipants working or residing in Lake County , IL . In this cohort , serologic and RT - PCR assess - ments showed that 5 . 6 % of study participants had evidence for acute or previous SARS - CoV - 2 infection . The current study provides the latest evidence further supporting the public health and risk mitigation measures put in place for COVID - 19 prevention and control . Similar to previous studies , we identiﬁed nonadherence to social distancing measures and travelling domestically since December 1 , 2019 as factors associated with SARS - CoV - 2 infection . The study is ongoing and follow - up analyses through a 9 - month ( ﬁnal ) data collection timepoint are planned . As the pandemic con - tinues , future analyses are scheduled to further assess SARS - CoV - 2 infection status over time and provide additional data on factors associ - ated with SARS - CoV - 2 infection . The impact of vaccination on changes in SARS - CoV - 2 epi - demiology over time is also an important factor to consider in future analyses .
