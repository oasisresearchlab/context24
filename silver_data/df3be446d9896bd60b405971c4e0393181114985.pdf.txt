End User Software Engineering : CHI 2010 Special Interest Group Meeting Abstract End users create software whenever they create , for instance , interactive web pages , games , educa - tional simulations , or spreadsheets . Researchers are working to bring the benefits of rigorous software engineering methodologies to these end users to try to make their software more reliable . Unfortunately , errors are pervasive in end - user software , and the resulting impact is sometimes enormous . This spe - cial interest group meeting will bring together the community of researchers who are addressing this topic with the companies that are creating and us - ing end - user programming tools .

Introduction One way to define “programming” is as the process of transforming a mental plan of desired actions for a computer into a representation that can be understood by the computer [ 13 ] . Expressed this way , it seems obvious that the study of humans and programming should be a topic of HCI . Indeed , this area of study has a long history , and has appeared under many names , including “Software Psychology” [ 27 ] , “Psychology of Programming” [ 9 , 12 ] and “Empirical Studies of Pro - gramming” ( ESP ) . We define “end - user programmers” ( EUP ) as people who write programs , but not as their primary job func - tion — they write programs in support of achieving their main goal , which is something else , such as ac - counting , designing web pages , office work , scientific research , entertainment , etc . End - user programmers generally use special - purpose languages such as spreadsheet languages or web authoring scripts , but some EUPs , such as chemists or other scientists , may learn to use “regular” programming languages such as C or Java to achieve their programming goals . Two NSF workshops determined that end - user software is in need of serious attention [ 5 ] . The reasons are compelling . Our research shows that while there are about 3 million professional programmers in the United States , over 12 million people say they do program - ming at work , and over 12 million people use spread - sheets and databases , and thus may also be considered to be doing programming [ 25 ] ( see Figure 1 ) . Unfortu - nately , however , errors are pervasive in software cre - ated by end users . When the software that end users create is not dependable , there can be serious conse - quences for the people whose retirement funds , credit histories , e - business revenues , and even health and safety rely on decisions made based on that software . For example , a Texas oil firm lost millions of dollars in an acquisition deal through spreadsheet errors [ 23 ] . Beyond correctness , end - user programs often lack oth - er hallmark qualities of software , including good per - formance , scalability , reusability , and interoperability . Two large collaborative efforts , one in the U . S . ( the EUSES Consortium http : / / eusesconsortium . org / ) , and one in Europe ( the Network of Excellence on End - User Development , http : / / giove . cnuce . cnr . it / eud - net . htm ) have produced a number of promising results in this area ( see , e . g . , [ 17 ] ) . Special Interest Group meetings at CHI’2004 , CHI’2005 , CHI’2007 , CHI’2008 , and CHI’2009 . and the WEUSE series of workshops at ICSE’2005 [ 10 ] , CHI’2006 [ 7 ] , Dagstuhl 2007 ( see www . dagstuhl . de / 07081 ) ICSE’2008 [ 2 ] , and ICSE’2009 [ 3 ] very successfully brought together re - searchers and companies interested in this topic . The special interest group ( SIG ) meeting at CHI’10 is designed to bring this community back together , as well as to introduce the area to other researchers and companies who are interested in allowing users to cre - ate higher - quality programs . Examples of Current Work End - User Software Engineering ( EUSE ) research has been gaining momentum and a number of EUSE pro - jects have been presented at CHI . Here are just a few examples . The “Natural Programming” project at Carnegie Mellon University has been working for more than 10 years to make programming more “natural” , or closer to the CHI 2010 : SIGs Session 3 April 10 – 15 , 2010 , Atlanta , GA , USA 3190 way people think . Many studies were performed ( e . g . , [ 14 , 18 , 20 , 21 ] ) , and new programming languages [ 22 ] and tools [ 15 , 28 ] were created . For example , Fig - ure 2 shows a “Why” - oriented technique for helping users understand how web pages are authored [ 19 ] . The “End - User Software Engineering” project involving researchers at Oregon State University and University of Washington aims to improve the reliability of soft - ware produced by end - user programmers . Some results have included “What You See Is What You Test” ( WY - SIWYT ) integrated with fault localization [ 6 ] , semi - automated detection of erroneous combinations of units in spreadsheets ( Figure 3 ) [ 1 ] , new type systems for end - user code ( Figure 4 ) [ 26 ] , and new methods for involving end users in the “debugging” of machine - learned programs ( Figure 5 ) [ 16 ] . The work empha - sizes research on how to engage users in end - user soft - ware engineering practices without detrimentally inter - rupting their problem - solving efforts . The Gender HCI Project [ 4 ] , a collaboration of Oregon State University and Drexel University , has the goal to support both males’ and females’ problem solving , es - pecially in end - user software development tasks . Our results show that females are less willing than males to try out and adopt software features that support testing and dataflow - oriented debugging , and further that male and female end - user programmers use different strate - gies when debugging [ 29 ] . We have recently developed a debugging tool that centers on strategies rather than individual tactics [ 11 ] . Current work also focuses on support for males and females in designing and reusing applications , for example , design of mashups and reuse of artifacts in web design [ 8 ] . Related work at Penn State has been exploring the impacts of up - front design planning in end - user programming , using simple repre - sentations like concept maps [ 24 ] .
