Methods : We included the ﬁrst 100 patients with laboratory - conﬁrmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection in Taiwan . Demographic , clinical , epidemiological and laboratory data were extracted from outbreak investigation reports and medical records . Results : Illness onset of the 100 patients was during January 11 to March 16 , 2020 . Twenty - nine ( 29 % ) had at least one underlying condition and ten ( 10 % ) were asymptomatic . Seventy - one were imported , including four clusters . Twenty - nine were locally - acquired , including four clus - ters . The median days from onset to report was longer in locally - acquired cases ( 10 vs 3 days ) . Three patients died ( case fatality rate 3 % ) and all of them had underlying conditions . As of May 13 , 2020 , 93 had been discharged in stable condition ; the median hospital stay was 30 days ( range , 10 e 79 days ) . Conclusion : The ﬁrst 100 cases of COVID - 19 in Taiwan showed the persistent threat of imported cases from different countries . Even though sporadic locally - acquired disease has been iden - tiﬁed , through contact investigation , isolation , quarantine and implementation of social distancing measures , the epidemic is contained to a manageable level with minimal local transmission .

In the beginning , most cases reportedly had exposure to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market . However , patients without exposure to the Market were also found . A novel corona - virus , later named Severe Acute Respiratory Virus Coronavirus - 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , was identiﬁed as the causative agent and the disease caused by SARS - CoV - 2 was named as coronavirus infectious disease - 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) . Because of geographic proximity between Taiwan and China , shared culture , and common language , approxi - mately 400 , 000 Taiwanese work in China , 1 plus another 10 , 000 study there . Having such close ties , Taiwan was expected to have importation of the disease from China early on . To prevent widespread transmission of the dis - ease , Taiwan began onboard quarantine on December 31 , 2019 , for all ﬂights coming in directly from Wuhan . Taiwan Centers for Disease Control ( Taiwan CDC ) laboratory set up protocol to test for SARS - CoV - 2 so that by the time COVID - 19 became a nationally reportable disease on January 15 , 2020 , Taiwan CDC was able to conﬁrm the disease . By mid - January , Thailand and Japan had identiﬁed cases of COVID - 19 in persons who had traveled there from Wuhan . 2 , 3 By the end of January 2020 , the COVID - 19 had been identiﬁed in 24 different countries , spanning Asia , Middle East , Europe , and North America . 4 COVID - 19 was declared a pandemic on March 11 , 2020 , by the World Health Organization . To prevent the spread of COVID - 19 in the community , throughout the ﬁrst three months of 2020 , Taiwan slowly expanded its border quarantine efforts from Wuhan , to Hubei Province of China , to China , and later other countries with outbreaks . By March 20 , 2020 , all travelers from abroad must undergo 14 days of quarantine upon their arrival to Taiwan . 5 The ﬁrst case of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in Taiwan was diagnosed on January 21 , 2020 . Here , we provide an anal - ysis of the ﬁrst 100 laboratory conﬁrmed COVID - 19 cases in Taiwan to describe the epidemiological characteristics and their outcome . Materials and methods Surveillance When Taiwan CDC announced COVID - 19 as a notiﬁable dis - ease on January 15 , 2020 , the reporting criteria included clinical symptoms ( fever and respiratory symptoms , or cough with dyspnea / respiratory difﬁculty , or radiologi - cally / pathologically diagnosed pneumonia ) as well as travel history to Wuhan , China , within 14 days of disease onset . The reporting criteria evolved to include all relevant travel exposure or contact history , and cover a wider spectrum of clinical illnesses . Since January 25 , the reporting clinical criteria was modiﬁed as fever and / or any respiratory symptoms . A conﬁrmed case should meet the reporting criteria for COVID - 19 and have respiratory specimen that tested posi - tive by real - time reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) or virus culture . To improve case detection , on February 12 , Taiwan CDC started a screening program for COVID - 19 to test persons who ( I ) had been tested negative for inﬂuenza but reported to have severe inﬂuenza with complications ; ( II ) had specimens taken for upper respiratory disease surveillance ; ( III ) were part of a cluster of inﬂuenza cases , or ( IV ) received a diagnosis of pneumonia but did not respond to empirical treatment . 6 Retrospective testing of all specimens received during January 31 to February 11 from patients meeting the above criteria were also tested for SARS - CoV - 2 . Imported cases were deﬁned as patients who had history of international travel within 14 days of disease onset ; imported - linked cases were deﬁned as patients who had a history of close contact with an imported case within 14 days of disease onset . A locally - acquired case had no his - tory of international travel or contact to an imported case within 14 days of disease onset . Detailed information including demographics , clinical and laboratory data was reported to the National Notiﬁable Disease Surveillance System . Cases with epidemiological linkages were classiﬁed as clusters . Contact tracing A thorough epidemiological investigation , including source determination and contact tracing , was conducted for each laboratory conﬁrmed COVID - 19 patient by the outbreak investigation team of Taiwan CDC and local health authorities . For each conﬁrmed case , contacts during the 14 days prior to symptom onset until the patient was isolated were identiﬁed . A close contact was a person who had face - to - face contact with a conﬁrmed case for more than 15 min while not wearing appropriate personal protection equipment ( PPE ) . A household contact was a close contact who lived in the same household with the index case , while a family contact was a family member not living in the same household . All close contacts were required to undergo home quarantine for 14 days after last exposure . All other contacts were asked to self - monitor their health condition for 14 days after last exposure . If a contact developed fever or respiratory tract symptoms , respiratory tract specimens were taken and tested for SARS - CoV - 2 . All household contacts and some non - household close contacts with contact intensity compara - ble to household contacts , for example , having meal together with the index case , were tested even if they had no symptoms . For asymptomatic cases , onset date was deﬁned as the date specimens were taken . Case management and laboratory diagnosis All conﬁrmed cases of COVID - 19 were immediately isolated in negative pressure or single - occupancy rooms in hospitals for further care . Clinical management was mainly sup - portive , but may also include antibiotics and / or anti - inﬂuenza medications as needed , according to the Interim Guideline for Clinical Management of SARS - CoV - 2 Infection published by Taiwan CDC . 7 Follow up respiratory tract specimens were collected to test for SARS - CoV - 2 . Two consecutive negative samples collected at least 24 h apart were required for patients to be de - isolated . Starting from 1602 T . - P . Tsou et al . February 28 , 2020 , three consecutive negative samples were required for de - isolation . Respiratory specimens were collected once every two to four days according to the Guideline , and the exact frequency of specimen collection was determined by clinicians . Patients fulﬁlling the criteria for de - isolation will be discharged if there is no need for clinical care , and the decision is up to the primary care physician . Data collection and statistical analysis Information on clinical presentation , underlying diseases and travel history of patients was collected during case investigation . Laboratory results within 48 h of admission were retrieved from medical records that were uploaded to the National Notiﬁable Disease Surveillance System . Based on the above information , the investigation team deter - mined the clinical severity of each conﬁrmed patient following the World Health Organization ( WHO ) interim guidance . 8 Ethical approval Data collection and analysis of cases were determined by the Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare to be part of a continuing public health outbreak response and were thus considered exempt from institutional review board approval . Results Demographics , clinical presentation and WHO classiﬁcation ( Table 1 ) During January 21 to March 18 , 2020 , there were 17 , 935 cases reported and tested for SARS - CoV - 2 , and 100 patients were diagnosed with COVID - 19 , with symptom onset from January 11 to March 16 , 2020 ( Fig . 1 ) . Forty - four were male . Median age was 44 years ( range , 11 e 88 ) . The most common initial symptoms were fever ( 54 % ) , cough ( 54 % ) and sore throat ( 35 % ) . Ten patients had diarrhea , but nausea and / or vomiting was infrequent ( 2 % ) . Eight ( 8 % ) patients reported anosmia / hyposmia and / or dysgeusia . All 10 asymptomatic cases were household or close contacts of conﬁrmed cases , and were diagnosed through contact investigation . Of the 29 patients who had at least one un - derlying condition , 17 had cardiovascular diseases ( including hypertension ) , 8 had diabetes mellitus and 4 had chronic lung disease . There were 51 patients who were reported within 3 days of symptom onset , and 41 patients were diagnosed within 3 days of symptom onset ( Table 1 ) . Among the 56 patients with total white blood cell count and percentage of lymphocyte available , 18 ( 32 . 1 % ) had lym - phopenia ( < 1000 / mL ) . Among the 50 patients with C - reactive protein ( CRP ) levels available , 19 ( 38 % ) had CRP > 1 mg / dL . Only ﬁve patients had D - dimer levels avail - able , and two were elevated ( 590 and 1539 ng / mL , respectively ) . Renal and liver function tests mostly remained within normal range ( Table 2 ) . Epidemiological features Among the 100 cases , 71 were imported , with 12 having been in China , including 11 from Wuhan and 1 from Macau . Thirty - one had traveled to Europe , including Spain ( n Z 5 ) , Italy ( n Z 4 ) , Germany ( n Z 4 ) , France ( n Z 4 ) , the United Kingdom ( n Z 4 ) , Austria ( n Z 3 ) , the Netherlands ( n Z 2 ) , and one of each from Iceland , Greece , Ireland , Switzerland and the Czech Republic . There were 13 cases from a tour group that had traveled to Turkey . Six cases had traveled to Asian countries other than China , including the Philippines ( n Z 3 ) , Japan ( n Z 2 ) and Indonesia ( n Z 1 ) . Four had Table 1 Characteristics of 100 COVID - 19 cases in Taiwan .

COVID - 19 in Taiwan 1603 traveled to Egypt , four to the United States and one was from the Diamond Princess cruise ship . In addition to the cluster from Turkey , there were 3 more imported clusters : 3 cases were classmates in Spain ; 2 were in the same travel group to Egypt , and 4 were family members who had traveled to Italy together . Of the 29 locally - acquired cases , there were 5 imported - linked cases and 1 isolated locally - acquired case ; the other 23 cases could be classiﬁed into 4 clusters . After extensive contact tracing , none of the 4 index cases had contacted people with recent travel history or respiratory symptoms . We failed to identify the infection source but additional cases were found . Cluster sizes ranged from 3 to 9 cases , as described below : Cluster A ( 5 cases ) : The index patient was diagnosed by retrospective COVID - 19 screening because he reported to have severe inﬂuenza with complications but tested nega - tive for inﬂuenza . Two household and two non - household family contacts were diagnosed . Cluster B ( 3 cases ) : The index patient was tested for SARS - CoV - 2 because she reported to have severe inﬂuenza with complications but tested negative for inﬂuenza . After the index patient was diagnosed , 1 household and 1 non - household family contact were diagnosed . Cluster C ( 6 cases ) : The index patient was tested for SARS - CoV - 2 because he received a diagnosis of pneumonia but did not respond to empirical treatment . After the index patient was diagnosed , 5 household contacts were diagnosed . Cluster D ( 9 cases ) : The index patient was tested for SARS - CoV - 2 because she received a diagnosis of pneumonia but did not respond to empirical treatment . After the index patient was diagnosed , a hospital outbreak was found , involving 3 healthcare workers , 2 household contacts , 1 patient on the same ward , 1 family member of another patient , and 1 janitor . Fifty - seven percent ( 41 / 71 ) of the 71 imported cases were reported within 3 days of symptoms onset ( median 3 days , range 0 e 12 ) ( Fig . 2 ) . However , only 34 % ( 10 / 29 ) of the locally - acquired cases were reported within 3 days of symptoms onset ( median 10 days , range 0 e 28 ) . Thirty - eight percent ( 11 / 29 ) of locally - acquired cases were reported more than 14 days after symptom onset . The 4 index cases of clusters A to D were diagnosed 19 , 28 , 18 and 10 days after symptom onset . Patient outcome As of May 13 , 2020 , there were 93 patients who had been discharged in stable condition ; the median hospital stay was 30 days ( range , 10 e 79 days ) . Eight patients received mechanical ventilation , including 1 with severe pneumonia , 6 with acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) and 1 with septic shock . Among patients with medication records available , 4 had used hydroxychloroquine , 2 had used hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin , and 1 had used lopinavir - ritonavir . Three patients died ( case fatality rate 3 % ) . The ages of the cases that died were 56 , 62 and 87 years ; 1 was female . All had multiple underlying conditions including diabetes mellitus , cardiovascular or renal diseases ; invasive venti - lator support was used for 12 e 30 days . One patient had used extra - corporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) for 14 days . One patient had restricted lung function upon discharge . Among the 10 asymptomatic cases , 6 had been dis - charged after being hospitalized for a median of 23 days Figure 1 Epidemiological curve of ﬁrst 100 COVID - 19 cases in Taiwan . 1604 T . - P . Tsou et al . ( range , 14 e 46 ) ; 4 remained hospitalized because of persistent positive test results for SARS - CoV - 2 . Discussion During January 21 to March 18 , 2020 , there were 100 cases of COVID - 19 conﬁrmed in Taiwan . Taiwan had implemented multiple measures to contain SARS - CoV - 2 infection . As of April 9 , 2020 , there were more than 1 . 4 million conﬁrmed cases of COVID - 19 worldwide ; on the other hand , during the same period , Taiwan had only 379 conﬁrmed cases and 5 deaths . With a population of 23 million , the incidence of laboratory conﬁrmed COVID - 19 in Taiwan ( 16 . 4 / million population ) was among the lowest in developed countries , and Taiwan remained in the containment phase of the COVID - 19 response . We share our experience during the early stage of this epidemic . Because of different surveillance and enrollment criteria , distribution of clinical presentations varied in re - ports from different countries . Reported percentage of patients with fever ranged between 43 and 98 % . 9 , 10 Because fever had been removed as an essential clinical criterion for reporting COVID - 19 since January 25 , 2020 , it is not surprising that not 100 % of our patients had fever . During the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) outbreak in 2003 , fever screening was used widely to identify cases , because nearly all patients with SARS had fever as initial presentation . 11 Furthermore , the viral shedding from respiratory specimens of SARS patients peaked at 6 e 11 days after onset of illness . Low rate of viral shedding in the ﬁrst few days of illness meant that early isolation measures would be effective . 12 In 2003 , Taiwan was able to identify SARS at international ports and prevent community spread by adopting fever screening at various locations . Such effects led to the continued use of fever screening since 2003 . However , knowing that only 54 % of the COVID - 19 patients in Taiwan had fever initially , the high level of viral shedding early in the disease course and the possibility of pre - symptomatic transmission , fever screening should not be the only method used to identify cases . 13 In fact , the effectiveness of widespread adoption of fever screening in public places for the current COVID - 19 outbreak should be re - evaluated . Our case series included outbreaks from different places and situations , including exposure among household and non - household family members , classmates , tour groups and hospitals . According to a previous study from Taiwan CDC , household contacts have the highest secondary clin - ical attack rate . 14 We found that interaction between members of the same tour group during the trip were akin to households in contact intensity , and they had similar risk of secondary attack . In SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS ) epidemics , hospital outbreaks involving healthcare workers led to loss of workforce and had a huge negative impact on the public health and healthcare sys - tems . 15 , 16 Among the ﬁrst 100 cases of COVID - 19 , we had a hospital outbreak involving 9 cases . The outbreak was controlled after the involved ward was shut down and all cases and contacts were isolated . After the SARS outbreak in 2003 , Taiwan put special emphasis on infection control measures in hospitals . 17 Proper use of PPE and imple - mentation of infection control practices may have helped in reducing SARS - CoV - 2 transmission before the disease was diagnosed , leading to the low secondary clinical attack rate among healthcare workers and limited the size of the hospital outbreak . Because of the geographical proximity and the frequent exchanges between Taiwan and China , we identiﬁed the ﬁrst imported case from China nine days after the genetic sequence of SARS - CoV - 2 was made public . 18 It is not sur - prising that the ﬁrst 13 cases in Taiwan were all imported or epidemiologically - linked to cases from China . Cases with travel history in Italy was reported as early as February 6 , one week after Italy reported its ﬁrst 2 cases , and before the establishment of COVID - 19 transmission was recognized Table 2 Laboratory results of 100 COVID - 19 cases in Taiwan .

Such notiﬁcation may prompt countries to strengthen surveil - lance and possibly identify local transmission . Information sharing also may foster collaboration between countries in outbreak investigation . 21 Compared to imported cases , locally - acquired cases took longer time to be diagnosed ( 10 days vs . 3 days ) . The difference in the timing of the reporting and diagnosis be - tween imported and locally - acquired cases is of concern . Because SARS - CoV - 2 is highly transmissible in the early phase of infection , 13 , 14 early diagnosis and isolation of pa - tients is crucial for disease containment . Multiple policies , including 14 - day home quarantine for all travelers arriving from COVID - 19 risk areas , declaration of health upon arrival at international ports and integration of recent travel his - tory to the centralized database of National Health Insur - ance , all contributed to the timely isolation and detection of imported cases by clinicians and public health ofﬁcials . 6 While imported cases did not cause outbreaks , locally - acquired cases led to the ﬁnding of clusters up to 9 cases . Our experience showed that because imported cases could be quickly identiﬁed , secondary cases were usually limited to household contacts when the index case was imported . On the contrary , the outbreak size was larger if the index case had locally - acquired disease and the infection source could not be found . Because of aggressive contact tracing and isolation , the locally - acquired disease outbreaks did not cause sustained transmission . Name - based rationing system securing affordable mask supply to the public since February , announcement of Guidelines for Large - Scale Public Gatherings by Taiwan CDC in March , and social distancing measures in April may have all helped to reduce transmission risk . 22 e 24 To prevent the establishment of COVID - 19 in the community , Taiwan CDC changed the reporting criteria to include all patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology on February 16 , 2020 . Furthermore , all patients can be reported and tested when COVID - 19 is suspected by clinicians . However , because COVID - 19 was , and still is , a largely imported disease , 25 to diagnose the disease , clinicians must have heightened awareness and suspicion of the disease when seeing patients who have no history of international travel . This study has limitations . First , at the time of writing this manuscript , some of the contacts were still under self health - monitoring or isolation and we do not know if they would become cases . Therefore , the number of clusters and cases involved may change over time . Second , we do not have treatment details for all patients , so we are un - able to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment . Third , viral load or culture results of clinical samples is not available . Fourth , baseline laboratory data are not avail - able for all patients . In conclusion , the ﬁrst 100 cases of COVID - 19 in Taiwan showed that even though sporadic locally - acquired disease has been identiﬁed , the disease is mainly imported by in - ternational travelers . Through contact investigation , isola - tion , quarantine and implementation of social distancing measures , the epidemic is contained to a manageable level with minimal local transmission . To prevent widespread community transmission , continued vigilance in diagnosing locally - acquired cases are needed . Declaration of Competing Interest None .
