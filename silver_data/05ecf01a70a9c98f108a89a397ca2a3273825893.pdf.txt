Box 407 , FIN - 00045 Helsinki , Finland ABSTRACT Surface deformation inflicted on two different kinds of thin layered polymer films was investigated under static indentation and dynamic loading ( plowing ) at room temperature . Affecting the surface were polished spherical steel tips of 0 . 5 - 1 . 6 mm radii moving at 0 . 1 - 16 . 0 mm / s along the surface . A load of 2 - 5 N was applied on the tip normal to the surface . The surface response was measured with a scanning white light interferometer . The relation between groove parameters ( width and depth ) and the deformation tool velocity as well as the tip diameter and the applied load were obtained from white light interferometer scans . In order to cover a large groove area , a series of 3D groove profiles were stitched together with a piece of software . The profile of the entire groove was compared to friction data recorded by the scratching device . The dependence of groove parameters on the input parameters ( tip radius , load force and velocity ) indicates that white light interferometry can be used to determine mechanical properties such as ‘scratchability’ ( abrasing resistance ) of polymer surfaces without sample contact . Keywords : interferometry , SWLI , polymer films 1 . INTRODUCTION Polymer coatings can improve the scratch and mar resistance of materials 1 . Such coatings are used in buildings , automobiles and electronics for functional and aesthetic purposes . Scratch resistance can be interpreted as a material’s resistance to scratch deformation that can be derived from the material response 2 , 3 . Despite improvements in coating technology , problems exist with long - term performance of polymer coatings exposed to hostile environments such as high humidity , temperature and other aggressive conditions such as mechanical impacts . Scratch and mar resistance is an important characteristic of polymer surfaces in numerous industrial applications . Progress in this area requires developing a methodology incorporating improved measurement techniques since there are phenomena that cannot be measured currently and developing models accounting for scratching tip roughness as well as time - and temperature dependence of polymer’s mechanical properties 4 . Contact tests have proved efficient in ranking materials with respect to their mechanical performance . While indentation tests give quantitative information about stiffness and elastic recovery of materials , scratch tests provide qualitative information concerning failure mechanisms like initiation of rupture . Scratch tests also differentiate ductile fractures from brittle ones 5 . Although extensive work has carried out on polymer wear , there is limited understanding on how intrinsic properties provide polymer materials with good scratch and mar resistance . The relevant intrinsic properties in this regard vary depending on the polymer type ( crystalline or amorphous ) and type of mechanical response ( glassy , ductile or rubbery ) 6 . * ivan . kassamakov @ helsinki . fi ; phone + 358 9 191 50689 Optical Micro - and Nanometrology in Microsystems Technology , edited by Christophe Gorecki , Anand K .

In order to properly understand the scratch resistance of materials , both the tip - sample interaction that causes the scratch damage and the resulting change in optical perception are studied 7 . These authors proposed a scratch test methodology for quantitative scratch resistance assessment based on optical scattering measurements of scratch profiles and their relationship to the damage morphology . Scratch visibility is the degree of visual perceptibility of scratch damage by the human eye , which can be influenced by the type of surface damage and by external factors such as color and lighting 3 , 8 . Using scratch resistance and scratch visibility for quality grading can be important in cases where only minor scratch damages are observed on a highly scratch - resistant material . However , brittle fractures cause drastic changes in surface roughness . There is enhanced light dispersion from the scratches making them easily perceptible . In applications where product aesthetics is emphasized , reducing scratch visibility of a material may be more important than improving its scratch resistance . Therefore , the balance between scratch resistance and scratch visibility as a quality measure depends on the application . Rangarajan et al 9 . , used optical imaging techniques to quantify the visibility of a scratch on a glossy polymer surface . These results emphasized the importance of optical contrast between the damage area and its surroundings . The total optical contrast is a combination of scratch size and the contrast in specular and off - specular scattering . Scratch dimensions are base for the all quantitative method for scratch performance evaluation . Laser scanning confocal microscopy ( LSCM ) 7 , 11 , 12 , atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) 12 , scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) 13 and optical microscopy 14 scratch width , depth and roughness measurement . Scanning white light interferometry ( SWLI ) is a noncontact , area data capturing method that doesn’t require sample preparation . A few studies using SWLI for polymer scratch resistance characterization are reported 6 , 15 . SWLI can be applied to a large variety of grooves and dents if proper magnification and suitable scan lengths are available 16 . A limitation of this method is that it requires a surface reflection that provides a clear interference pattern . This study deals with determination of groove parameters : depth and width in different scratch regions with scanning white light interferometer and evaluation of the SWLI as a non - contact method for scratch characterization of polymer coatings used in liquid crystal displays ( LCD ) . 2 . BACKGROUND As a result of uniaxial compression at constant strain rate and temperature , polymers show , in general , two kinds of deformations : elastic and plastic . Elastic deformations recover , while plastic deformation constitutes permanent changes . Whether the change is elastic or plastic depends on the position on the stress - strain curve 17 . The shape of the stress - strain curve depends on polymer temperature 18 as well as on compression velocity 19 . The total residual strain of the surface depends on e . g . temperature , humidity , scratching velocity and polymer surface hardness 4 , 19 . The scratch - and dent resistance of materials differs in dynamic and static situations 17 , 20 . In order to study the mechanical properties of a surface , a method to produce indentations and grooves in a controlled way is used . A uniaxial load , perpendicular to the surface , is usually applied on a conical or a spherical tip . To investigate dynamic mechanical properties the tip or sample is often moved with a constant velocity under a progressive or constant load 7 , 18 , 21 . This method is also applied in this work . The contact between the indenter and the polymer surface in case of static loading was studied by Oliver and Pharr 22 . They found that the relationship between indentation depth and load force may be written as : Proc . of SPIE Vol . 6188 61881G - 2 ( ) m f P h h α = − ( 1 ) where P is the load force , h the maximum penetration depth , h f the depth of the residual dent whereas m and α are constants determined by a least squares fit . The material hardness ( H m ) may be defined from the projected area during peak load A and the maximum force used P max 22 : max m P H A = . ( 2 ) Therefore , by studying the contact area that is proportional to the width and depth of the groove , it is possible to estimate the static hardness of the material . In our experiments , static situations occur in the beginning of the grooving process , and at the ‘stopping points’ ( cfr . chapter 3 . 2 ) . The deformation created in the surface during scratching is determined by the normal force that acts perpendicular to the surface and by the sliding friction that acts along the surface . Thus , the scratching process may be assumed to comprise both indentation and sliding . Hamilton and Goodman 23 introduced a model in which a semispherical stress field caused by the normal force and a proportional shear force are applied to the surface to model a spherical scratching tip . Several factors affect the residual scratch depth during the scratching process , e . g . the elastic modulus and yield stress of the surface coating as well as the apparent and true friction coefficients between the surface and the tip . Surface properties , such as intrinsic hardness also affect the scratching process 18 . The Hamilton and Goodman model predicts that the Young’s modulus directly affects the contact area between the scratching tip and the surface . It can be shown 18 that the scratch depth d , can be written as a function of tip radius R , which is known , and contact zone area a : 2 2 d R R a = − − ( 3 ) Elastic recovery which can be modeled by linear elasticity theory 18 : 2 ( 1 ) 2 W e h P E ν− = ( 4 ) where h e is the elastically recoverable height , W the width of the groove , P the applied normal load , E the tensile Young’s modulus and ν the Poisson’s ratio . The residual scratch depth H can then be obtained from ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) . The dynamic scratch hardness is defined 24 as : 2 4 W d P H q π ≈ ( 5 ) where q varies according to the type of material tested and how it supports the tip ( q ~ 2 for rigid plastic materials and q ~ 1 for viscoelastic materials ) . The width and the depth of the groove are important parameters for static and dynamic hardness of the polymer characterization .

Scanning White Light Interferometry The SWLI is an optical technique for surface characterization . In SWLI , a light beam passes through an interferometric objective containing a beam splitter that reflects half of the incident beam onto a reference surface and that passes the rest of the beam onto the tested surface . Light reflected from the test surface and from the reference surface combine forming an interferogram . Fig . 1 schematically shows the operating principle of a scanning white light interferometer with Mirau interferometric objective . After the initial location the objective is moved , and several successive interferograms are imaged . Pixel - by - pixel the interferograms as the one shown in Fig . 1 ( monitored by a CCD camera ) are analyzed and the light intensity modulation is obtained as the optical path difference is varied through the objective’s focus . The peak of the envelope of the modulated light intensity provides an estimate of the relative surface height at each pixel . 3 . 2 . Sample preparation Thin glass plates covered with multiple thin layered polymer films were studied . Between these polymer films were thin adhesion and retardation layers . Such structures are common on liquid crystal displays . Two types of samples were used : A type and B type . These two types differ from each other by the coating used , by their internal layer thicknesses , and materials . Each film was grooved using a uniaxially loaded spherical tip attached to a custom made floating jig ( Fig . 2 ) that was secured to a horizontally positioned Instron Model 8848 microtester 25 . Several grooves were produced parallel and equidistant to each other . A groove was created in the following way : In the beginning , the scratching tip was pressed against the surface with a constant force ( indentation point ) . After this , the tip traversed 2 . 5 mm along the surface with a constant velocity ( translation region , Fig 3A ) , stopped for 5 seconds ( stopping point , Fig 3B ) and then continued its translation for 10 mm to another 5 second stop before the next translation . In the end , the tip was subtracted from the surface leaving a residual dent ( spring - back point ) . Figure 1 : Scanning white light interferometer . Proc . of SPIE Vol . 6188 61881G - 4 Figure 2 : Floating jig . Weights can be added onto the T - shaped beam to increase the normal load on the tip . Each groove was generated using different parameters ( tip radius , uniaxial load and grooving velocity ) . The tip radii were 0 . 5 , 1 . 0 and 1 . 6 mm . The load forces were 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 N depending on the sample . The velocities were 0 . 1 , 0 . 75 , 1 . Instrumented tip for grooving ( Changeable tips capable of friction measurement ) 2 .

The tangential force component ( friction ) was recorded during the scratching process . Three optical scans covering an 870 . 0 µm wide and 630 . 0 µm long area were conducted along each groove , one from each region . In addition , two long scans covering the entire groove ( 12 mm ) were stitched together by a commercial software ( Phase Mosaic , FringeSoft Inc . ) from 24 separate 630 . 0 µm long scans with a 150 . 0 µm overlapping along the groove direction . The grooved samples were moved with step - motors ( Densei P5J - U245 - 101 with a 2 . 5 µ m step ) that controlled the X - Y translation stage . The stitched image was compared to the tip - surface slide friction data obtained from the grooving device to ensure stopping point detection . 3 . 3 . Sample characterization The SWLI data were analyzed using a Matlab code ( MathWorks , Matlab 7 . 0 ) that was developed to obtain the groove depth ( H ) and width ( W ) ( Fig . 4 ) . The image tilt caused by the platform inclination was removed automatically using Euler angles . Gaussian and median filtering ( 3x3 median filter matrix , 7x7 Gaussian bell matrix ) were applied to the scans . At the stopping points , where the tip propagation velocity along the surface was zero , the depth was measured from the deepest point of the dent . The parameters ( H and W ) are basic parameters used for scratch resistance and visibility characterization 18 . These parameters can readily be obtained using SWLI . In addition , SWLI has nanometer - resolution in z - direction . The depth of the groove’s profile was defined as the mean of the depth determined from the left and from the right groove edge . The same profile was used for the groove width definition as the distance from the left to the right groove edge . The edge was determined as the maximum change in the derivative of a mid - groove cross - section profile across the groove . From the translation region of each groove , a scan was taken and the groove parameters were determined as an average from five cross - sections taken at equally spaced sections . 4 . RESULTS Fig . 5 and Fig . 6 show the depth of the groove in the translation region for different velocities under various applied loads for both sample types . The figures indicate logarithmic dependence between groove depth and scratching velocity for both sample types . In these figures as well as in Figs . 7 - 12 , at some low load forces and higher velocities , the depth could not be characterized , because no grooves were detected with the magnification used .

Fig . 13 shows a groove bottom profile , in the vicinity of the stopping point , along the translation direction . A 3D picture of the same groove was presented in Fig . 3B . The groove in Fig . 13 was caused by a 0 . 5mm - radius tip , loaded by 3 N and translated at 0 . 1 mm / s . Observe that as the velocity decreases to 0 mm / s , H increases . With increasing velocity the curve slope is reduced and H changes . Changes in the scratch velocity , from constant to 0 mm / s and back , produce the worst scratch damages , compared to maintaining constant velocity . However , this dent formation is essentially caused by indentation of the tip due to a high load force on a small area , which allows for more plastic during the 5 seconds stop time .

CONCLUSIONS The results show that SWLI allows determination of residual groove depth and width accurately in the translation region . The logarithmic dependence of depth and width for both of the samples on velocity should be connected with the dynamic friction theory . The groove depth and width could be obtained at the indentation and stopping points . In future work , those parameters should be linked with the Oliver and Pharr static indentation theory 22 . In future work , effects of the layered structure of the samples should also be considered . The groove cross - section along the indenter direction of translation shows that changing the scratch velocity during the scratch process produces the worst scratch damage , as compared to keeping the scratch velocity the same or increasing the normal load imposed on the indenter . This happens especially if the scratch velocity is brought down to zero . A data acquisition system for friction records with higher sampling rate should be developed , permitting more precise fitting of the stitched data to the friction force . Scanning white light interferometry can be applied as a nondestructive tool to evaluate scratch depth and width , and to possibly relate them to scratch resistance and visibility . REFERENCES 1 . X .
