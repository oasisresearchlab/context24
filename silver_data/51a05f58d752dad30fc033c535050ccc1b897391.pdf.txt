Schunn , Professor , Psychology , Learning Sciences and Policy , Intelligent Systems iii Copyright © by Chu Sern Joel Chan 2014 iv Innovation fundamentally begins with a good idea . But where do good ideas come from ? Much research suggests that innovative breakthroughs are often inspired by past experience : things and ideas that one has interacted with in the world . However , the same experiences that can inspire innovation can sometimes constrain or harm innovation through focus on previously unsuccessful solutions . In this dissertation , I explore principles for guiding interactions with sources of inspiration ( previous / other ideas ) to maximize their benefits and minimize their pitfalls , focusing on the role of conceptual distance and diversity of sources . I analyze thousands of ideas for complex innovation challenges ( e . g . , increasing accessibility in elections , revitalizing struggling urban areas ) posted to an online crowd - sourced innovation platform that required contributors to cite sources of ideas , tracing the impact of the distance and diversity of sources in ideas’ conceptual genealogies on their creative success ( as judged by an expert panel ) . In this dissertation , I make three primary contributions to the literature . First , leveraging techniques from natural language processing and machine learning , I develop a validated computational methodology for studying conceptual distance and diversity with complex design concepts , which addresses significant issues of efficiency and scalability faced in prior work . Second , I challenge the widespread but unevenly supported notion that far sources provide the best insights for creative ideation ; addressing key methodological issues in prior work ( time THE IMPACT OF SOURCES OF INSPIRATION ON THE GENESIS OF INNOVATIVE IDEAS Chu Sern Joel Chan , PhD University of Pittsburgh , 2014 v scale , statistical power , and problem variation ) , I show that overreliance on far sources can harm ideation success , and that good ideas can often come from very near sources . Finally , I demonstrate the potential value of incorporating a temporal dimension into analyses of the impact of sources of inspiration : I find evidence of differential impacts of source distance and diversity ( viz . , increased problem variation for the effect of source distance , and a more robust positive effect of source diversity ) when considering sources farther back in ideas’ conceptual genealogies . vi TABLE OF CONTENTS PREFACE…………………………………………………………………………………… .

This transition has been gradual and , thankfully , now feels altogether fitting : standing on the shoulders of giants , I feel ready for ( God - willing ) a lifetime of inquiry and contributions to the science of cognition . I would be remiss , however , if I did not acknowledge at least some of the many giants on whose shoulders I now stand . Foremost among these giants is Chris Schunn , my advisor . Fearless , endlessly energetic and creative , with one of the sharpest and quickest minds I have been privileged to interact with , you have taught me so much about real , creative , interdisciplinary inquiry . Without your expert guidance and ever - present faith in my potential , I would not where I am today . I hope to one day begin to match your research brilliance and fruitful mentorship . The next group of giants is comprised of my dissertation committee ( Steven Dow , Kevin Ashley and Timothy Nokes - Malach ) , my mentoring committee ( Kevin and Tim again ! ) , the Higher - Order Cognitive Collective ( particularly Susannah Paletz , Kevin Soo , Meghan Bathgate , Liz Richey , JooYoung Jang , Carmela Rizzo , Cristina Zepeda , Dan Belenky , Matt Bernacki , Lou Alfieri , Amanda Crowell , Matty Lau , Sam Abramovich , and Melissa Patchan ) , and the venerable Verrocchio research group that launched me on this crazy path of studying engineering innovation ( Kate Fu , Jon Cagan , Ken Kotovsky , and Kris Wood ) . From these wonderful xv individuals I have derived an endless supply of inspiration , constructive criticism , research ideas , and encouragement . Many of the ideas represented in this dissertation have been forged in the fire of collaboration with these wonderful people . A third group of giants are those who helped form me as a lifelong learner during my undergraduate education , both at university and in my research internship : Tom Stepehenson , Karen Jones , Joel Hagaman , Mikael Lindstrom , Sharon Gorman , Gilbert Parks , Greg Trafton , and Raj Ratwani . A fourth group of giants deserves mention : my extended adopted family in Pittsburgh from City Reformed Presbyterian Church , who have tirelessly helped to keep me grounded in the joy of where I am , and to maintain a healthy work - life balance as I discover the fingerprints of God in the human mind . Last , but certainly not least , my family – my bedrock of support , unconditional love , and continual guidance , encouragement , and inspiration — and Anna , my lovely wife : I am so blessed to walk this road with you , and I am excited for what’s next ! 1 1 . 0 GENERAL INTRODUCTION 1 . 1 MOTIVATION AND OVERVIEW OF INQUIRY CONTEXT Creativity and innovation are crucial mainstays in modern society . Continued innovation is a central driver of today’s knowledge - based economy ; in order to survive and thrive , firms can no longer depend on commoditization and scale — they must innovate or die ( Vogel , Cagan , & Boatwright , 2005 ) . The U . S . , too , needs innovation to continue thriving in an increasingly globalized and knowledge - driven economy ( National Academy of Engineering , 2005 ) . Further , complex problems facing modern society , such as global poverty , e - waste , cancer , and climate change , are more pressing than they have ever been , and call for new innovative solutions . How can governments , organizations , and training programs effectively train and support innovators to rise to these challenges ? A crucial part of the puzzle is a robust scientific knowledge base that articulates key principles of how creativity happens . Cognitive science offers a key piece of this knowledge base , focusing on the creative process ( including mental processes and strategies ) that lead to creative breakthroughs . One of the most robust and established insights from the cognitive science of creativity is that the creation of new ideas is strongly constrained or structured by prior knowledge and experience . People have a strong tendency to transfer features and elements from recently encountered stimuli or examples in their creative production , often despite instructions to avoid 2 such copying ( Jansson & Smith , 1991 ; Marsh , Bink , & Hicks , 1999 ; Marsh , Ward , & Landau , 1999 ; Perttula & Sipilä , 2007 ; Purcell & Gero , 1992 , 1996 ; Smith , Ward , & Schumacher , 1993 ; Ward , 1994 ) . This tendency towards transfer can harm creativity . Some experiments have shown that people will transfer elements from examples even when those examples are known to be of low quality ( Chrysikou & Weisberg , 2005 ; Jansson & Smith , 1991 ) . Prior knowledge can also lead to functional fixedness — the inability to see novel uses for an artifact due to prior conceptions of its dominant functionality ( Adamson , 1952 ; German & Barrett , 2005 ; Maier , 1931 ) — and mental set effects ( also called Einstellung ) — where people persist in using previously successful solution approaches in problem solving without considering alternative , potentially more effective , approaches for the current task at hand ( Bilalić , McLeod , & Gobet , 2008 ; Luchins , 1942 ; Öllinger , Jones , & Knoblich , 2008 ; Wiley , 1998 ) . However , this tendency to base creative production on prior knowledge is not an inherent detractor from creativity . Purcell and Gero ( 1996 ) have argued that fixation is an imprecise ( and perhaps incorrect ) term for this phenomenon : when the examples are innovative or of high quality , the transfer may increase the creativity of the final product . Conformity to examples does not necessarily influence other key process measures of creativity , such as quantity or elaboration of concepts generated ( Marsh , Landau , & Hicks , 1996 ) , and , depending on features of the source ( e . g . , novelty , conceptual distance from domain ) , may also increase the quality of ideas ( Ward , 2008 ) , or also novelty of ideas ( Chan et al . , 2011 ; Smith , Kohn , & Shah , 2008 ) . For these reasons , intentional curation of the building blocks of prior knowledge / experience—hereafter called sources of inspiration —is a crucial component of effective creative practice . Tradecraft literature ( e . g . , books , blogs ) is replete with advice and support for curating sources of inspiration : Henry ( 2011 ) urges creators to carefully curate 3 stimuli to keep their creative fuel burning , and Dyer and colleagues ( 2011 ) urge innovators to keep their “pool of available bricks” in memory fresh , to increase the probability that truly breakthrough concepts can be generated . Detailed ethnographic studies of successful innovators and creators have also corroborated the central role of curating and intentionally interacting with sources of inspiration ( Eckert & Stacey , 1998 ; Hargadon & Sutton , 1997 ; Herring et al . , 2009 ) . Further , the issue of how to prevent and / or alleviate design fixation is an active area of research in design methodology research ( Linsey et al . , 2010 ; Youmans , 2011 ; Zahner et al . , 2010 ) . But how should one curate one’s sources of inspiration ? Or to pose the question more precisely , what principles should guide the curation and use of sources of inspiration in the creative process such that creators can benefit from them while avoiding their potential pitfalls ? One key facet of this question concerns the nature of the sources themselves : are there particular features or properties of inspirational sources ( e . g . , conceptual distance to the problem , conceptual diversity among considered sources ) that provide reliable signals of greater or lesser inspirational potential ? This dissertation addresses these fundamental questions with quantitative analyses of creative processes and outputs of individuals solving real - world creative design problems , focusing on the issue of conceptual distance . I focus on this issue given the discrepancy between the widespread claims offered in the scientific literature and among practitioners as to how conceptual distance of and between sources can matter for creative outcomes , and the strength ( or lack thereof ) of the evidence base for these claims . This presents an opportunity for significant knowledge gains to be made , in contrast to other relatively uncontroversial claims regarding the nature of sources ( e . g . , build on high - quality solutions ) . 4 The aim of this dissertation is to yield insights into the specific question of what principles should guide the curation of inspiration sources , and also more generally for efforts to understand and maximize creativity and innovation , from the design and implementation of innovation support tools and methods ( e . g . , computer - aided design , formal design - by - analogy methods ) , to the new wave of creative crowdsourcing platforms ( similar to OpenIDEO ) , to creativity education in the disciplines , to the intentional design of creative social spaces ( e . g . , R & D centers , innovation hubs ) . 1 . 2 CONCEPTUAL DISTANCE 1 . 2 . 1 Overview The first major line of inquiry in this dissertation examines the role of the conceptual distance of sources . Consider the problem of e - waste accumulation : the world generates 20 - 50 million metric tons of e - waste every year , yielding environmentally hazardous additions to landfills . A designer might approach this problem by building on a source that is conceptually near to the problem domain , like smaller - scale electronics reuse / recycle efforts , or by drawing inspiration from a far source , like edible food packaging technology ( e . g . , to design re - usable electronics parts ) . What are the relative benefits of different levels of source conceptual distance ? Many authors , principally those studying the role of analogy in creative problem solving , have proposed that conceptually far sources —structurally similar ideas with many surface ( or object ) dissimilarities— are the best sources of inspiration for innovative breakthroughs ( Gentner 5 & Markman , 1997 ; Holyoak & Thagard , 1996 ; Poze , 1983 ; Ward , 1998 ) . This proposal — here called the Conceptual Leap Hypothesis — is consistent with many anecdotal accounts of innovative breakthroughs , from Kekule’s discovery of the structure of benzene by visual analogy to a snake biting its tail ( Findlay , 1965 ) , to George Mestral’s invention of Velcro by analogy to burdock root seeds ( Freeman & Golden , 1997 ) , to more recent case studies ( Enkel & Gassmann , 2010 ; Kalogerakis , Lu , & Herstatt , 2010 ) . 1 . 2 . 2 Research Base and Opportunities for Advancement However , empirical support for this proposal is mixed . Some studies have shown an advantage of far over near sources for novelty , quality , and flexibility of ideation ( Chan et al . , 2011 ; Chiu & Shu , 2012 ; Dahl & Moreau , 2002 ; Gonçalves , Cardoso , & Badke - Schaub , 2013 ; Hender , Dean , Rodgers , & Jay , 2002 ) ; but , some in vivo studies of innovation have not found strong connections between far sources and creative mental leaps ( Chan & Schunn , 2014 ; Dunbar , 1997 ) , and other experiments have demonstrated equivalent benefits of far and near sources ( Enkel & Gassmann , 2010 ; Malaga , 2000 ; Tseng , Moss , Cagan , & Kotovsky , 2008 ) , and even harmful effects of distance ( Fu et al . , 2013 ) . Thus , more empirical work is needed to determine whether the Conceptual Leap Hypothesis is well supported . Key methodological shortcomings in prior work further motivate more and better empirical work . First is the issue of time scale . Prior studies may be too short ( typically 30 minutes to 1 hour ) to convert far sources into viable concepts . Scarce cognitive resources are required to ignore irrelevant surface details , attend to potentially insightful structural similarities , and adapt the source to the target context . Additionally , many far sources may yield shallow or 6 unusable inferences ( e . g . , due to non - alignable differences in structural or surface features ; Perkins , 1997 ) ; thus , designers might have to sift through many samples of far sources to find “hidden gems” . These higher processing costs for far sources might partially explain why some studies show a negative impact of far sources on the number of ideas generated ( Chan et al . , 2011 ; Hender et al . , 2002 ) . In the context of a short task , these processing costs might take up valuable time and resources that could be used for other important aspects of ideation ( e . g . , iteration , idea selection ) ; in contrast , in real - world design contexts , designers typically have days , weeks or even months ( not an hour ) to consider and process far sources . A second issue is a lack of statistical power . Most existing experimental studies have N ≤ 12 per treatment cell ( Chiu & Shu , 2012 ; Hender et al . , 2002 ; Malaga , 2000 ) ; only four studies had N ≥ 18 ( Chan et al . , 2011 ; Fu et al . , 2013 ; Gonçalves et al . , 2013 ; Tseng et al . , 2008 ) , and they are evenly split in support / opposition for the benefits of far sources . Among the few correlational studies , only Dahl and Moreau ( 2002 ) had a well powered study design in this regard , with 119 participants and a reasonable range of conceptual distance . Enkel and Gassmann ( 2010 ) only examined 25 cases , all of which were cases of cross - industry transfer ( thus restricting the range of conceptual distance being considered ) . This lack of statistical power may have led to a proliferation of false negatives ( potentially exacerbated by small or potentially zero effects at short time scales ) , but possibly also severely overestimated effect sizes or false positives ( Button et al . , 2013 ) ; more adequately powered studies are needed for more precise estimates of the effects of conceptual distance . A final methodological issue is problem variation . Many experimental studies focused on a single design problem . The inconsistent outcomes in these studies may be partially due to some design problems having unique characteristics , e . g . , coincidentally having good solutions that 7 overlap with concepts in far sources . Indeed , Chiu and Shu ( 2012 ) , who examined multiple design problems , observed inconsistent effects across problems . Other investigations of design stimuli have also observed problem variation for effects ( Goldschmidt & Smolkov , 2006 ; Liikkanen & Perttula , 2008 ) . 1 . 3 CONCEPTUAL DIVERSITY 1 . 3 . 1 Overview The second major line of inquiry in this dissertation considers the hypothesis that , in using sources of inspiration , one should attempt to connect sources and concepts that are conceptually far from each other . We shall call this the Conceptual Combination Hypothesis . In the course of a concept’s development , designers often build on ideas from more than one source ( e . g . , different approaches for a single sub - system , different sources for different sub - systems ) . Consider again an innovator developing creative solutions for the problem of e - waste accumulation . She might build on related but slightly different approaches to educating about e - waste , such as classroom curricula , video education series on Youtube , and on - label information about reuse / recycle options ( near combinations ) ; alternatively , she might combine concepts from gamification , social media campaigning and marketing , and exercise and dieting lifestyle - change mobile applications ( far combinations ) . The hypothesis being investigated is that a breakthrough creative solution is more likely in the latter case . 8 This hypothesis is related to the Conceptual Leap Hypothesis , but distinct in that it does not necessarily distinguish between combining sources that are far from each other within the problem domain ( e . g . , combining a bus and a plane to come up with a new transportation system ) and far combinations from within to outside ( e . g . , combining a bicycle and a printer ) , or Figure 1 : Illustrated variations of inspiration source sets to sources outside the problem domain ( e . g . , combining a heart defibrillator with geese migration patterns ) . Figure 1 illustrates the range of possible variations in source sets by distance from domain and distance of combination . It is important to understand not just how each dimension of conceptual distance influences ideation separately , but also how they might interact . 9 1 . 3 . 2 Research Base and Opportunities for Advancement The recommendation to prefer far combinations has its scientific roots in Mednick’s ( 1962 ) influential claim that “ [ t ] he more mutually remote the elements of the new combination , the more creative the process or solution” ( p . 221 ) . Further , theorists who analyze tecnological innovation through studying patent citation networks contend that patents that reference other patents from a wide number of technology areas hold more potential for radical innovation compared to patents that reference other patents in similar technology areas ( Olsson , 2005 ) . Recent social network theories of innovation have similarly emphasized the importance of combining information from diverse sources as a basis for innovation ( Vedres & Stark , 2010 ) . These theoretical ideas are consistent with many anecdotes of creative breakthroughs coming from far combinations , such as award - winning chef Samuelsson’s fusion Swedish cuisine , Grammy - winning singer - songwriter Shakira’s fusion of Latin and hip - hop musical sounds , and the highly successful Magic collectible cards game , which combined concepts from collectible items ( such as baseball trading cards ) and ordinary games ( Johansson , 2006 ) . Far conceptual combinations might support creative breakthroughs via the generation of emergent features when trying to combine them . Research on conceptual combination suggests that , when concepts are very different , people switch from relatively simpler combination processes — such as attribute inheritance / transfer or property mapping ( Hampton , 1987 ; Wisniewski & Gentner , 1991 ) — to more complex processes , such as structure mapping ( Gentner et al . , 1997 ) , which can generate emergent features ( attributes that are true of neither constituent , but true of the conjunction ; Hampton , 1997 ) . Relatedly , the degree to which emergent features arise from combinations has been found to be an inverse function of the 10 conceptual similarity between the constituent concepts ( Wilkenfeld , 1995 ; Wilkenfeld & Ward , 2001 ; Wisniewski , 1997 ) . Thus , combining concepts that are conceptually far from each other is likely to result in original features and functions that might prove to be crucial components of a creative breakthrough . Far combinations may also protect against fixation : considering sources far from each other in conceptual space may prevent one from getting too strongly stuck in one region of the conceptual space , perhaps due in part to the distribution of memory activation across a wider range of features and functions . Another possible inspirational mechanism of far combinations ( or at least having a diverse set of sources to draw from ) is the increased statistical probability of finding an interesting and potentially useful combination ( Simonton , 1988 ) , although this mechanism might only operate if the set consists mostly of useful rather than completely irrelevant sources . Experimental and observational studies generally support the Conceptual Combination Hypothesis , although much of it focuses on the effects of far combinations on novelty of ideas generated . The ability to create high - quality and original emergent features from conceptual combinations has been associated with performance on creative problem - solving tasks ( Mumford , Baughman , & Sager , 2003 ) . Generating ideas using stimuli from different categories have been shown to yield more novel ideas than using stimuli from similar ( or the same ) categories , both in simple brainstorming experiments with toy problems ( Baughman & Mumford , 1995 ; Howard - Jones , Blakemore , Samuel , Summers , & Claxton , 2005 ; Zeng , Proctor , & Salvendy , 2011 ) , with more realistic creative tasks like graphic design or business opportunity identification ( Chase , Herman , & Dow , 2012 ; Gielnik , Frese , Graf , & Kampschulte , 2011 ) , although sometimes at the expense of idea quality ( Mobley , Doares , & Mumford , 1992 ) . Baruah 11 ( 2011 ) found no positive effect on originality , but did find a positive effect on breadth of search , with participants who were stimulated with distantly related categories surveying more idea categories than participants stimulated with closely related categories . Nijstad and colleagues ( 2002 ) demonstrated similar benefits of stimuli diversity on breadth of search . In a more ecologically valid setting , Taylor and Greve ( 2006 ) showed that comic book creators’ diversity of prior genre experience positively predicted creative performance ( measured in terms of collector market value of comics produced ) . In general , the literature provides support for a link between distant combinations and the novelty of ideas generated , but most studies ( except Taylor & Greve , 2006 ) have not yet looked carefully at whether there is an effect on final quality of ideas . 12 1 . 4 RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND OVERVIEW OF DOCUMENT In this dissertation , I contribute to knowledge on curation of inspiration sources by testing the Conceptual Leap and Conceptual Combination Hypotheses , addressing key methodological issues in prior work ( e . g . , time scale , problem variation , novelty vs quality in creative outcomes ) . Specifically , the two primary research questions addressed in this dissertation are : 1 ) What are the relative benefits of different levels of source conceptual distance for creative outcomes ? 2 ) What are the relative benefits of different levels of source conceptual combination distance for creative outcomes ? I examine these questions in the context of OpenIDEO ( www . openideo . com ) , a large - scale Web - based crowd - sourced innovation platform where thousands of individuals have been coming together to collaboratively solve a wide range of socially and environmentally important problems ( e . g . , managing e - waste , increasing accessibility in elections , restoring community in socially fragmented cities ) . Contributors to the platform follow a structured design process — starting from initial problem structuring , through concept generation and screening , to refinement and evaluation of concepts — to produce concepts that are ultimately implemented by the challenge sponsors , producing real - world impact . I trace how variations in conceptual distance of sources from the problem domain , and conceptual distance among sources , relate to creative success ( i . e . , the creation of designs that are both novel and add significant value over existing designs ) . The remainder of this document consists of six remaining chapters . In Chapter 2 , I describe in more detail the overall research context and methodological approach . Chapters 3 - 5 13 examine three different angles on the issue of conceptual distance : chapter 3 examines the role of conceptual distance from one’s problem domain ; chapter 4 examines the role of conceptual distance from one’s solution path ; and chapter 5 examines the related notion of conceptual distance between one’s sources . Then , in Chapters 6 through 8 , I leverage the rich structure of my data to explore more fine - grained variations of the main research questions , specifically exploring how the effects of distance and / or diversity might be different for “indirect” sources ( i . e . , sources of one’s immediate sources , or more informally , one’s “conceptual genealogy” ) . Finally , Chapter 9 integrates the insights yielded from this dissertation , and examines implications for the theory and practice of creative inspiration , and opportunities for further research . 14 2 . 0 GENERAL METHODS 2 . 1 OVERVIEW OF RESEARCH CONTEXT OpenIDEO ( www . openideo . com ) is a Web - based crowd - sourced innovation platform that addresses a range of social and environmental problems ( e . g . , managing e - waste , increasing accessibility in elections ) . The OpenIDEO designers , with expertise in design processes , guide contributors to the platform through a structured design process ( see Table 1 ) to produce concepts that are ultimately implemented for real - world impact ( " Impact Stories , " n . d . ) . The overall analysis focuses on two crucial early stages in the process : first , in the inspiration phase ( lasting between 1 . 5 to 4 weeks , M = 3 . 1 ) , contributors post inspirations ( e . g . , descriptions of solutions to analogous problems , case studies of stakeholders ) , which help to define the problem space and identify promising solution approaches . The OpenIDEO designers guide this inspiration phase by soliciting specific kinds of inspirations , through “assignments” : some assignments call for descriptions of related efforts ( e . g . , battery collection initiatives , for solving the problem of e - waste ) ; some call for interviews with stakeholders ( e . g . , how do users feel about their electronics ? ) ; while others explicitly solicit “far inspirations” ( e . g . , thinking of other situations in which lack of knowledge is a barrier to action ) . Then , in the concepting phase ( lasting the next 2 to 6 weeks , m = 3 . 4 ) , contributors post concepts , i . e . , specific solutions to the problem . They are different from inspirations in that they are explicit , concrete proposals for how 15 Table 1 : OpenIDEO structured design process Phase Description 0 : Start Community receives challenge brief ; problem broadly framed ; initial constraints / requirements described 1 : Inspiration Community submits , “applauds” ( i . e . , votes on ) , and gives feedback on inspirations ( e . g . , descriptions of solutions to analogous problems , case studies of stakeholders ) ; problem space defined in more detail , promising solution approaches ( “themes” ) identified by administrators / sponsors 2 : Concepting Community submits , applauds , and gives feedback on concepts ( proposed solutions to problem ) 3 : Screening Using applause as input , administrators & sponsors shortlist subset of concepts for further refinement 4 : Refinement Community collaborates with authors to improve shortlisted concepts 5 : Evaluation Community provides focused evaluations of shortlisted concepts based on administrator & sponsor - defined challenge - specific evaluation rubrics 6 : Realization Administrators & sponsors select winning concepts for implementation to solve the specific problem posed by the challenge , as opposed to information about the problem , descriptions of solutions to other problems , or vague descriptions of potential “entry points” for successful solutions ( e . g . , proposing a specific education plan for reusing electronics [ concept ] , vs identifying lack of knowledge as a major barrier [ inspiration ] ) . In later stages , concepts are selected , refined , and implemented . Figure 2 shows an example concept - it is representative of the typical length and level of detail in concepts , i . e . , ~ 150 words on average , 16 more detail than one or two words / sentences / sketches , but less detail than a full - fledged design report / presentation or patent application . The OpenIDEO platform has many desirable properties as a research context for this work , including the existence of multiple design problems ( 22 as of February 2014 ) , thousands Figure 2 : Example concept illustrating the typical amount of detail per concept 17 Figure 3 : Depiction of OpenIDEO citation workflow . When posting concepts / inspirations , users are prompted to cite concepts / inspirations they “build upon” by dragging bookmarked concepts / inspirations ( middle panel ) to the citation area ( left panel ) . Users can also search for related concepts / inspirations at this step ( middle panel ) . These cited sources then show up as metadata for the concept / inspiration ( right panel ) . of concepts and inspirations , text - based record of ideas to enable efficient text - based analyses , and a record of feedback received , another critical factor in design success . A central property for the research questions in this dissertation is the explicit nature of sources of inspiration in the OpenIDEO workflow . The site encourages contributors to build on others ' ideas . Importantly , when posting concepts or inspirations , contributors are prompted to cite any concepts or inspirations that serve as sources of inspiration for their idea . Specifically , on the interface page where users post a concept there is a prominent interface for citing concepts ( see Figure 3 ) , with the following instructions : “Did someone else ' s Inspiration or Concept inspire your Concept ? Drag across any contribution that did - you ' ll help everyone understand where yours came from and give you and the other user extra DQ points ! ” Here , “DQ points” 18 refer to “design quotient” points that OpenIDEO users can receive and display on their profile for various actions on the platform ( e . g . , posting inspirations , concepts , commenting and / or citing / collaborating on other inspirations / concepts ) : importantly , it is used in this instance as a way to highlight the fact that building on other ideas is a central part of the OpenIDEO process , and as a way to incentivize attending to and describing the sources of one’s ideas . Further , when browsing other concepts / inspirations , they are able to also see concepts / inspirations the given concept / inspiration “built upon” ( i . e . , cited as explicit sources of inspiration ; see Figure 3 ) . This culture of citing sources is particularly advantageous , given that people generally forget to monitor or cite their sources of inspiration ( Brown & Murphy , 1989 ; Marsh , Landau , & Hicks , 1997 ) , and my goal is to study the effects of source use . While users might still forget to cite sources , these platform features help ensure higher rates of source monitoring than other naturalistic ideation contexts . 2 . 2 SAMPLE AND INITIAL DATA COLLECTION The full dataset for this study consists of 2 , 341 concepts posted for 12 completed challenges by 1 , 190 unique contributors , citing 4 , 557 unique inspirations ; 241 ( 10 % ) of these concepts are shortlisted for further refinement . These challenges were sampled for uniformity in platform features ( OpenIDEO periodically adds / removes / refines features : e . g . , citation features were added from the 6 th challenge onwards ; design phase structure was altered slightly after the 18 th challenge onwards ) . See Table 2 for a description of the 12 challenges ( with some basic metadata on each challenge ) . Figure 4 shows the full - text challenge brief for two challenges . 19 Table 2 : Descriptions and number of posts for OpenIDEO challenges in final analysis sample Description ( id ) Num . inspirations Num . concepts ( shortlisted ) How might we increase the number of registered bone marrow donors to help save more lives ( bone - marrow ) ? 186 71 ( 7 ) How might we inspire and enable communities to take more initiative in making their local environments better ( community - initiative ) ? 160 44 ( 11 ) How can we manage e - waste & discarded electronics to safeguard human health & protect our environment ( e - waste ) ? 60 26 ( 8 ) How might we better connect food production and consumption ( food - production - consumption ) ? 266 147 ( 10 ) How can technology help people working to uphold human rights in the face of unlawful detention ( human - rights ) ? 248 62 ( 7 ) How might we identify and celebrate businesses that innovate for world benefit and inspire other companies to do the same ( identify - celebrate ) ? 122 24 ( 13 ) How might we use social business to improve health in low - income communities ( social - business ) ? 131 46 ( 11 ) How might we increase social impact with OpenIDEO over the next year ( social - impact ) ? 67 40 ( 12 ) How might we restore vibrancy in cities and regions facing economic decline ( vibrant - cities ) ? 558 119 ( 13 ) How might we design an accessible election experience for everyone ( voting ) ? 241 47 ( 8 ) How might we support web entrepreneurs in launching and growing sustainable global businesses ( web - entrepreneurs ) ? 88 49 ( 7 ) How can we equip young people with the skills , information and opportunities to succeed in the world of work ( youth - employment ) ? 118 32 ( 3 ) 20 With administrator permission , we downloaded all inspirations and concepts ( which exist as individual webpages ) and used an HTML parser to extract the following data and metadata : 1 ) Concept / inspiration author ( who posted the concept / inspiration ) 2 ) Number of comments ( before the refinement phase ) 3 ) Shortlist status ( yes / no ) , 4 ) List of cited sources of inspiration 5 ) Full - text of concept / inspiration Not all concepts cited inspirations as sources . Of the 2 , 341 concepts , 707 ( posted by 357 authors ) cited at least one inspiration , collectively citing 2 , 245 unique inspirations . 110 of these concepts ( ~ 16 % ) were shortlisted ( see Table 2 for a breakdown by challenge ) . This set of 707 concepts is the primary sample for this dissertation ; the others serve as a contrast to examine the value of explicit building at all on prior sources , and to aid in interpretation of any negative or positive effects of variations in distance . I analyze the impact of distance and diversity of inspirations ( and not cited concepts ) given my focus on ideation processes during “original” or non - routine design , where designers often start with a problem and only “inspirations” ( information about the problem , potentially related designs ) rather than routine design ( e . g . , configuration , parametric design ) , where designers might be modifying or iterating on existing solutions rather than generating novel ones ( Chakrabarti , 2006 ; Dym , 1994 ; Gero , 2000 ; Ullman , 2002 ) . Also , the Conceptual Leap and Combination hypotheses map most clearly to non - routine design : the theoretical and research base is primarily concerned with the creation of new designs , rather than incremental modification or improvement of existing designs . 21 Figure 4 : Full - text of challenge briefs from two OpenIDEO challenges . 22 2 . 3 MEASURES 2 . 3 . 1 Creative Outcome The creative outcome measure is whether a concept gets shortlisted . Shortlisting is done by a panel of expert judges , including the original challenge sponsors , who have spent significant time searching for and learning about existing approaches , and the OpenIDEO designers , who are experts in the general domain of creative design , and who have spent considerable time upfront with challenge sponsors learning about and defining the problem space for each challenge . An expert panel is considered by many authors to be a “gold standard” for measurement of innovation ( Amabile , 1982 ; Baer & McKool , 2009 ; Brown , 1989 ; Sawyer , 2012 ) . Further , the panel’s judgments combine consideration of both novelty and quality ( A . Jablow , personal communication , May 1 , 2014 ) , the standard definition of creativity ( Sawyer , 2012 ) . Since OpenIDEO challenges are novel and unsolved , successful concepts are different from ( and , perhaps more importantly , significantly better than ) existing unsatisfactory solutions . I use shortlist ( rather than win status ) given my focus on the ideation phase in design ( vs . convergence / refinement , which happens after concepts are shortlisted , and can strongly influence which shortlisted concepts get selected as “winners” for implementation ) . 23 2 . 3 . 2 Conceptual Distance and Diversity 2 . 3 . 2 . 1 Measurement Approach Measuring conceptual distance is a major methodological challenge , especially when studying large samples of ideation processes ( e . g . , many designs across many design problems ) . The complex and multifaceted nature of typical design problems can make it difficult to distinguish “within” and “between” domain sources in a consistent and principled manner . Further , using only a binary scale risks losing variance information that could be critical for converging on a more precise understanding of the effects of conceptual distance . Continuous distance measures are an attractive alternative , but can be extremely costly to obtain at this scale , especially for naturalistic sources ( e . g . , relatively developed text descriptions vs . simple sketches or one - to - two sentence descriptions ) . Human raters may suffer from high levels of fatigue , resulting in poor reliability or drift of standards . These issues are compounded when considering conceptual distance between sources , especially for concepts with many ( e . g . , more than two or three ) sources , since all pairwise combinations need to be considered . I address this methodological challenge by using probabilistic topic modeling ( Blei , 2012 ; Steyvers & Griffiths , 2007 ) , a major computational approach for understanding large collections of unstructured text . Topic modeling is similar to other unsupervised machine learning methods — e . g . , K - means clustering , and Latent Semantic Analysis ( Deerwester , Dumais , Furnas , & Landauer , 1990 ) — but distinct in that it emphasizes human understanding of not just the relationship between documents in a collection , but the “reasons” for the hypothesized relationships ( e . g . , the “meaning” of particular dimensions of variation ) , largely because the algorithms underlying these models tend to produce dimensions in terms of clusters 24 of tightly co - occurring words . Thus , they have been used most prominently in applications where understanding of a corpus , not just information retrieval performance , is a high priority goal , e . g . , knowledge discovery and information retrieval in repositories of scientific papers ( Griffiths & Steyvers , 2004 ) , describing the structure and evolution of scientific fields ( Blei & Lafferty , 2006 , 2007 ) , and discovering topical dynamics in social media use ( Schwartz et al . , 2013 ) . I use Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( LDA ; Blei , Ng , Jordan , & Lafferty , 2003 ) , the simplest topic model . LDA assumes that documents are composed of a mixture of latent “topics” ( occurring with different “weights” in the mixture ) , which in turn generate the words in the documents . LDA defines topics as probability distributions over words : for example , a “genetics” topic can be thought of as a probability distribution over the words { phenotype , population , transcription , cameras , quarterbacks } , such that words closely related to the topic { phenotype , population , transcription } have a high probability in that topic , and words not closely related to the topic { cameras , quarterbacks } have a very low probability . Using Bayesian statistical learning algorithms , LDA infers the latent topical structure of the corpus from the co - occurrence patterns of words across documents . This topical structure includes 1 ) the topics in the corpus , i . e . , the sets of probability distributions over words , and 2 ) the topic mixtures for each document , i . e . , a vector of weights for each of the corpus topics for that document . One can derive conceptual similarity between any pair of documents by computing the cosine between their topic - weight vectors . In essence , documents that have the same dominant topics in similar relative proportions are the most similar . 25 2 . 3 . 2 . 2 Document preprocessing To train the topic model , I used all documents in the full dataset , i . e . , 2 , 341 concepts , 4 , 557 inspirations , and 12 challenge briefs ( 6 , 910 total documents ) . All documents were first tokenized using the TreeBank Tokenizer from the open - source Natural Language Tool Kit Python library ( Bird , Klein , & Loper , 2009 ) . To improve the information content of the document text , I removed a standard list of stopwords , i . e . , highly frequent words that do not carry semantic meaning on their own ( e . g . , “the” , “this” ) . I used the open - source MAchine Learning for LanguagE Toolkit’s ( MALLET ; McCallum , 2002 ) stopword list . 2 . 3 . 2 . 3 Model - building I used MALLET to train an LDA model with 400 topics ( LDA requires that the modeler pre - specify the number of topics to be learned ) , with asymmetric priors for the topic - document and topic - word distributions , which allows for some words to be more prominent than others and some topics to be more prominent than others , typically improving model fit and performance ( Wallach , Mimno , & McCallum , 2009 ) . Priors were optimized using MALLET’s in - package optimization option . Additional technical details on the model - building procedure are available in the Appendix A . Resulting cosines between inspirations and the challenge brief ranged from . 01 to . 91 ( M = . 21 , SD = . 18 ) , a fairly typical range for large - scale information retrieval applications ( Jessup & Martin , 2001 ) . 26 2 . 3 . 2 . 4 Model Validation Since I use LDA’s measures of conceptual distance as a substitute for human judgments , I validate the adequacy of the topic model using measures of fit with human similarity judgments on a subset of the data by trained human raters . Continuous similarity . Trained raters used a Likert - type scale to rate inspirations from two OpenIDEO challenges ( bone - marrow and e - waste , n = 345 and 199 , respectively ) for similarity to their challenge brief , from 1 ( very dissimilar ) to 6 ( extremely similar ) . I was able to train and obtain complete ratings from five raters for the e - waste challenge , and three for the bone - marrow challenge . Raters were given the intuition that the rating would approximately track the proportion of “topical overlap” between each inspiration and the challenge brief , or the extent to which they are “about the same thing” . The design challenge context was explicitly deemphasized , so as to reduce the influence of individual differences in perceptions of the “relevance” of sources of inspiration . Thus , the raters were instructed to treat all the documents as “documents” ( e . g . , an article about some topics , vs . “problem solution” ) and consciously avoid judging the “value” of the inspirations , simply focusing on semantic similarity . Raters listed major topics in the challenge brief and evaluated each inspiration against those major topics . To ensure internal consistency , the raters also sorted the inspirations by similarity after every 15 - 20 judgments . They then inspected the rank ordering and composition of inspirations at each point in the scale , and made adjustments if necessary ( e . g . , if an inspiration previously rated as “1” now , in light of newly encountered inspirations , seemed more like a “2” or “3” ) . Reflecting the difficulty of the task , raters achieved relatively low but acceptable agreement , with aggregate consistency intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC ( 2 , 3 ) ) = . 46 ( mean 27 inter - coder correlation = . 26 ) for the bone - marrow challenge and ICC ( 2 , 5 ) = . 74 ( mean inter - coder correlation = . 36 ) for the e - waste challenge . LDA cosines correlated highly with the continuous human similarity judgments for both challenges , with r = . 54 , 95 % CI = [ . 46 , . 61 ] for Figure 5 . Scatterplot of LDA cosines vs . averaged human continuous similarity judgments for inspirations in the bone - marrow ( left panel ) and e - waste challenges ( right panel ) . the bone - marrow challenge , and r = . 51 , 95 % CI = [ . 40 , . 60 ] for the e - waste challenge ( see Figure 5 ) . Note that in both challenges , the LDA - human correlation is better than the highest correlation between human raters ( r = . 39 for bone - marrow , and r = . 48 for e - waste ) , reinforcing the value of automatic coding methods for this difficult task . Binary distance . For comparability with prior work , I also measure fit with binary ( within - vs . between - domain ) distance ratings . Two raters also classified 345 inspirations from the same two challenges as either within - or between - domain . Raters first collaboratively defined the problem domain , focusing on the question , “What is the problem to be solved ? ” before rating inspirations . Within - domain inspirations were information about the problem ( e . g . , stakeholders , 28 constraints ) and existing prior solutions for very similar problems , while between - domain inspirations were information / solutions for analogous or different problems . Reliability for this measure was acceptable , with an overall average kappa of . 78 ( 89 % agreement ) . All disagreements were resolved by discussion . Similar to the continuous similarity judgments , the point biserial correlation between the LDA - derived cosine and the binary judgments was also Figure 6 . Scatterplot of LDA cosines vs . averaged human binary similarity judgments ( top panel ) , and boxplot of cosine against the challenge brief for within - vs . between - domain inspirations ( bottom panel ) . 29 high , at . 50 , 95 % CI = [ . 42 , . 58 ] for the bone - marrow challenge , and . 43 , 95 % CI = [ . 31 , . 54 ] for the e - waste challenge ( see Figure 6 , top panel ) . The mean cosine to the challenge brief was also higher for within - domain ( M = 0 . 49 , SD = 0 . 25 , N = 181 ) vs . between - domain inspirations ( M = 0 . 23 , SD = 0 . 20 , N = 164 ) , d = 1 . 16 , 95 % CI = [ 1 . 13 , 1 . 19 ] ( see Figure 6 , bottom panel ) . Together , these results show that the LDA - derived cosines closely approximate human judgments of conceptual distance of inspirations from the challenge brief , and are therefore a reasonable substitute for those judgments . Additional validation . As further validation , concepts within the same challenge were more similar to each other compared with concepts from a different challenge : the mean pairwise cosine for within - challenge pairs ( M = 0 . 35 , SD = 0 . 20 for first 14 , 700 pairwise comparisons Figure 7 . Gaussian kernel density plots for ( A ) pairwise cosines for between - and within - challenge concept pairs , and ( B ) cosines for concepts and inspirations vs . their challenge briefs . 30 between first 50 concepts ) was much higher than that of between - challenge pairs ( M = 0 . 06 , SD = 0 . 05 for 333 , 000 pairwise comparisons with 550 concepts from remaining 11 challenges ) , Wilcoxon rank sum = 4 , 585 , 392 , 213 , p < . 0001 , est . location difference in medians = 0 . 28 ( see Figure 7 A ) . Additionally , concepts were conceptually closer to the challenge brief ( M = 0 . 28 , SD = 0 . 19 , N = 2340 ) compared to inspirations ( M = 0 . 21 , SD = 0 . 18 , N = 4566 ) , Wilcoxon rank sum = 6 , 609 , 964 , p < . 0001 , est . location difference = 0 . 07 ( see Figure 7 B ) . This also validated the topic model because concepts are solutions to the problem , whereas inspirations may or may Figure 8 . Topics found by LDA within examples of near and far inspirations for the e - waste challenge 31 not have closely related information ; thus , concepts should overall be more similar to the challenge brief than inspirations . These results lend further strength to the validity of the topic model of this corpus . Figure 8 shows examples of a near and far inspiration ( from the e - waste challenge ) , along with the top 3 LDA topics ( represented by the top 5 words for that latent topic ) , computed cosine vs . its challenge brief , and human similarity rating . The top 3 topics for the challenge brief are { waste , e , recycling , electronics , electronic } , { waste , materials , recycling , recycled , material } , and { devices , electronics , electronic , device , products } , distinguishing e - waste , general recycling , and electronics products topics . These examples illustrate how LDA is able to effectively extract the latent topical mixture of the inspirations from their text ( inspirations with media also include textual descriptions of the media , mitigating concerns about loss of semantic information due to using only text as input to LDA ) and also capture intuitions about variations in conceptual distance among inspirations ( a document about different ways of assigning value to possessions is intuitively conceptually more distant from the domain of e - waste than a document about a prior effort to address e - waste ) . These LDA cosines are leveraged to generate the three primary measures of conceptual distance in subsequent chapters : distance from the problem , distance from one’s solution path , and distance between sources ( also called diversity of sources ) . The details of how these measures are derived will be given in context of those chapters . 32 2 . 3 . 3 Control measures Given that the study design and analytic approach is primarily correlational , it is important to identify and rule out or adjust for major third variable factors that may influence the creative outcomes of concepts ( particularly in the later stages , where prototyping and feedback are especially important ) and may be correlated with the predictor variables . Feedback . Considering the collaborative nature of OpenIDEO , I reasoned that feedback in the form of comments ( labeled here as FEEDBACK ) influence success . Comments can offer encouragement , raise issues / questions , or provide specific suggestions for improvement , all potentially significantly enhancing the quality of the concept . Further , feedback may be an alternate pathway to success via source distance , in that concepts that build on far sources may attract more attention and therefore higher levels of feedback , which then improve the quality of the concept . Quality of cited sources . Concepts that build on existing high - quality concepts ( e . g . , those who end up being shortlisted or chosen as winners ) have a particular advantage of being able to learn from the mistakes and shortcomings , good ideas , and feedback in these high - quality concepts . Thus , as a proxy measure of quality , the number of shortlisted concepts a given concept builds upon ( labeled SOURCESHORT ) could be a large determinant of a concept’s success . 33 2 . 4 ANALYTIC APPROACH The analytic goal is to predict the creative outcomes of 707 concepts , posted by 1 , 190 authors for 12 different design challenges . Authors are not cleanly nested within challenges , nor vice versa ; our data are cross - classified , with concepts cross - classified within both authors and challenges ( see Figure 9 ) . This cross - classified structure violates assumptions of uniform independence between concepts : concepts posted by the same author or within the same challenge may be more similar to each other . Failing to account for this non - independence could lead to overestimates of the statistical significance of model estimates ( i . e . , make unwarranted claims of statistically significant effects ) . This issue is exacerbated when testing for small effects . Additionally , modeling between - author effects allows us to separate author - effects ( e . g . , higher / lower creativity ) from the impact of sources on individual concepts 1 . Thus , I employ generalized linear mixed models ( also called hierarchical or multilevel generalized linear models ) to model both fixed effects ( of our independent and control variables ) and random effects ( potential variation of the outcome variable attributable to author - or challenge - nesting and also potential between - challenge variation in the effect of distance ) on shortlist status ( a binary variable , which requires logistic , rather than linear , regression ) . 1 Demographic variables were not available for all authors , and other author - level variables ( e . g . , number of contributions ) were not predictive of mean Pr ( shortlist ) for authors . 34 Figure 9 . Illustrated cross - classified structure of the data The following is the general structure of these models ( in mixed model notation ) : 𝜂 𝑖 ( 𝑎𝑢𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑟𝑗𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑘 ) = 𝛾 00 + ∑ 𝛾 𝑞0 𝑋 𝑞𝑖 𝑞 + 𝑢 0𝑎𝑢𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑟𝑗 + 𝑢 0𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑘 where  𝜂 𝑖 ( 𝑎𝑢𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑟𝑗𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑘 ) is the predicted log odds of being shortlisted for the i th concept posted by the j th author in the k th challenge  𝛾 00 is the grand mean log odds for all concepts  𝛾 𝑞0 is a vector of q predictors ( q = 0 for our null model )  𝑢 0𝑎𝑢𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑟𝑗 and 𝑢 0𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑘 model between - author and between - challenge variability in mean 𝛾 00 I used the lme4 package ( Bates , Maechler , Bolker , & Walker , 2013 ) in R ( R Core Team , 2013 ) , using full maximum likelihood estimation by the Laplace approximation to fit the models . An initial model predicting the outcome with only the intercept and between - challenge and - author variation confirms the presence of significant non - independence , with between - author and between - challenge variation in shortlist outcomes estimated at 0 . 44 , and 0 . 50 , respectively . The 35 intra - class correlations for author - level and challenge - level variance in the intercept are ~ . 11 and . 13 , respectively , well above the cutoff recommended by Raudenbush and Bryk ( 2002 ) 2 . 2 Although concept - level variance is not estimated in mixed logistic regressions , we follow Zeger et al’s ( 1988 ) suggestion of ( 15 / 16 )  3 / 3 as a reasonable approximation for residual level - 1 variance ( the concept level in our case ) . 36 3 . 0 CONCEPTUAL DISTANCE AND CREATIVE SUCCESS This chapter examines the Conceptual Leap Hypothesis ( i . e . , far sources provide the best insights for creative success ) . 3 . 1 METHODS The challenge briefs varied in length and specificity across challenges , as did mean raw cosines for inspirations . But , these differences in mean similarity were much larger , d = 1 . 90 , 95 % CI = [ 1 . 85 to 1 . 92 ] ( for 80 inspirations from 4 challenges with maximally different mean cosines ) , than for human similarity judgments ( coded separately but with the same methodology as before ) , d = 0 . 18 , 95 % CI = [ – 0 . 05 to 0 . 43 ] . This suggested that between - challenge differences were more an artifact of variance in challenge brief length / specificity . Thus , to ensure meaningful comparability across challenges , I normalized the cosines by computing the z - score for each inspiration’s cosine relative to other inspirations from the same challenge before analyzing the results in the full dataset . However , similar results are found using raw cosines , but with more uncertainty in the statistical coefficient estimates . I then subtracted the cosine z - score from zero such that larger values meant more distant . From these “reversed” cosine z - scores , two different distance measures were computed to 37 examine possibly distinct effects of source distance : 1 ) max distance ( DIST MAX ) , i . e . , the distance of the furthest source from the problem domain and 2 ) mean distance ( DIST MEAN ) . DIST MAX allows us to estimate “upper bounds” for the benefits of distance : do the best ideas really come from the furthest sources ? DIST MEAN capitalizes on the fact that many concepts relied on multiple inspirations and allows us to estimate the impact of the relative balance of relying on near vs . far sources ( e . g . , more near than far sources , or vice versa ) . 3 . 2 RESULTS 3 . 2 . 1 Descriptive statistics On average , 16 % of concepts in the sample get shortlisted ( see Table 3 ) . DIST MEAN is centered approximately at 0 , reflecting our normalization procedure . Both DIST MAX and DIST MEAN have a fair degree of negative skew . SOURCESHORT and FEEDBACK have strong positive skew ( most concepts either have few comments or cite 0 or 1 shortlisted concepts ) . There is a strong positive relationship between DIST MAX and DIST MEAN ( see Table 4 ) . All variables have significant bivariate correlations with SHORTLIST except for DIST MAX ; however , since it is a substantive variable of interest , and using bivariate correlations for feature selection can result in Type II error ( e . g . , predictors may have small but important effects that only become apparent after partialing out effects of other variables ) , I will model it nonetheless . There do not appear to be potential multicollinearity concerns with the control variables , but there is a high bivariate correlation between DIST MAX and DIST MEAN .

The baseline model estimates a strong positive effect of FEEDBACK , estimated with high precision : each additional comment added 0 . 10 [ 0 . 07 , 0 . 12 ] to the log - odds of being shortlisted , p < . 001 . The model also estimated a positive effect of SHORTSOURCE , B = 0 . 14 [ – 0 . 08 , 0 . 36 ] but with poor precision , and falling short of conventional statistical significance , p = . 21 ; nevertheless , I leave it in the model for theoretical reasons . The baseline model is a good fit to the data , reducing deviance from the null model ( with no control variables ) by a large and statistically significant amount ,  2 ( 1 ) = 74 . 35 , p = . 00 . 3 . 2 . 2 . 1 Max distance Adding DIST MAX to the model results in a significant reduction in deviance from the baseline model ,  2 ( 2 ) = 0 . 13 , p = . 47 ( see Table 5 ) . This model estimated a negative effect of DIST MAX , such that a 1 - unit increase in DIST MAX predicted a . 33 decrease in the log - odds of being shortlisted , after accounting for the effects of FEEDBACK , SHORTSOURCE , and challenge - and author - level nesting , p < . 05 . However , this coefficient was estimated with considerable uncertainty , as indicated by the large confidence intervals ( coefficient could be as small as – 0 . 06 40 or as large as – 0 . 60 ) ; considering also the small bivariate correlation with SHORTLIST , we are fairly certain that the “true” coefficient is not positive ( contra the Conceptual Leap Hypothesis ) , but we are quite uncertain about its magnitude . Importantly , this negative effect of was robust across challenges : allowing DIST MAX to vary across challenges produced a near - zero estimate of Table 5 : Model estimates and fit statistics for cross - classified multilevel logistic regressions of Pr ( shortlist ) on DIST MAX , with comparison to baseline model ( controls only ) Baseline model ( controls only ) DIST MAX , fixed slope DIST MAX , random slope Fixed effects 𝛾 00 , intercept – 2 . 66 [ – 3 . 28 , – 2 . 03 ] – 2 . 57 [ – 3 . 29 , – 2 . 05 ] – 2 . 57 [ – 3 . 29 , – 2 . 05 ] 𝛾 10 , FEEDBACK 0 . 09 * * * [ 0 . 07 , 0 . 12 ] 0 . 10 * * * [ 0 . 07 , 0 . 12 ] 0 . 10 * * * [ 0 . 07 , 0 . 12 ] 𝛾 20 , SOURCESHORT 0 . 14 [ – 0 . 08 , 0 . 36 ] 0 . 15 [ – 0 . 07 , 0 . 38 ] 0 . 15 [ – 0 . 07 , 0 . 38 ] 𝛾 30 , DIST MAX – 0 . 33 * [ – 0 . 60 , – 0 . 06 ] – 0 . 32 * [ – 0 . 59 , – 0 . 06 ] Random effects 𝑢 0𝑎𝑢𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑟𝑗 for intercept 0 . 29 0 . 31 0 . 32 𝑢 0𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑘 for intercept 0 . 75 0 . 76 0 . 74 𝑢 3𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑘 for DIST MAX 0 . 00 Model fit statistics Deviance 511 . 39 506 . 04 505 . 99 AIC 521 . 39 518 . 04 521 . 99 m p < . 10 ; * p < . 05 ; * * p < . 01 ; * * * p < . 001 ; 95 % CI ( Wald ) = [ lower , upper ] 41 Figure 10 .

Figure 10 visually displays the estimated relationship between DIST MAX and Pr ( shortlist ) , evaluated at mean values of feedback and shortlisted sources . To aid interpretation , I also plot the predicted Pr ( shortlist ) for concepts that cite no sources using a horizontal gray bar ( bar width indicates uncertainty in estimate of Pr ( shortlist ) ) : concepts with approximately equivalent amounts of feedback ( i . e . , mean of 8 . 43 ) , have a predicted Pr ( shortlist = . 09 , 95 % CI = [ . 07 to . 11 ] ; using a logistic model , the coefficient for “any citation” ( controlling for feedback ) is 0 . 31 , 42 95 % CI = [ 0 . 01 to 0 . 62 ] ) . This bar serves as an approximate “control” group , allowing us to interpret the effect not just in terms of the effects of far sources relative to near sources , but also in comparison with using no sources . Comparing the fitted and observed curves with this bar highlights how the advantage of citing vs . not citing inspirations seems to be driven mostly by citing relatively near inspirations : Pr ( shortlist ) for concepts that cite far inspirations converges on that of no - citation concepts . I emphasize again that , despite the uncertainty in the degree of the negative relationship between DIST MAX and Pr ( shortlist ) , the data do not support an inference that the best ideas are coming from the farthest inspirations . 3 . 2 . 2 . 2 Mean distance Similar results were obtained for DIST MEAN ( see Table 6 ) . Adding DIST MEAN to the controls only model results in a small but significant reduction in deviance from the baseline model ,  2 ( 1 ) = 6 . 27 , p = . 01 . There was a robust negative relationship between DIST MEAN and Pr ( shortlist ) , such that a 1 - unit increase in DIST MEAN was associated with a decrease of approximately . 40 in the log - odds of being shortlisted , p < . 05 . The estimates of this effect were obtained with similarly low precision regarding the magnitude of the effect , with a 95 % CI upper limit of at most B = – 0 . 09 ( but as high as – 0 . 71 ) . Again , as with DIST MAX , this negative relationship was robust and did not vary across challenges : allowing DIST MEAN to vary across challenges also produces a near - zero estimate of between - challenge variance in the effect of DIST MEAN ; similarly , AIC is increased with this model , and model fit does not improve ,  2 ( 2 ) = 0 . 07 , p = . 48 ( again , p - value here is halved to correct for overconservativeness ) . 43 Table 6 : Model estimates and fit statistics for cross - classified multilevel logistic regressions of Pr ( shortlist ) on DIST MEAN , with comparison to baseline model ( controls only ) Baseline model ( controls only ) DIST MEAN , fixed slope DIST MEAN , random slope Fixed effects 𝛾 00 , intercept – 2 . 66 [ – 3 . 28 , – 2 . 03 ] – 2 . 74 [ – 3 . 36 , – 2 . 11 ] – 2 . 74 [ – 3 . 36 , – 2 . 11 ] 𝛾 10 , FEEDBACK 0 . 09 * * * [ 0 . 07 , 0 . 12 ] 0 . 10 * * * [ 0 . 07 , 0 . 12 ] 0 . 10 * * * [ 0 . 07 , 0 . 12 ] 𝛾 20 , SOURCESHORT 0 . 14 [ – 0 . 08 , 0 . 36 ] 0 . 13 [ – 0 . 09 , 0 . 35 ] 0 . 13 [ – 0 . 09 , 0 . 35 ] 𝛾 30 , DIST MEAN – 0 . 40 * [ – 0 . 71 , – 0 . 09 ] – 0 . 40 * [ – 0 . 73 , – 0 . 07 ] Random effects 𝑢 0𝑎𝑢𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑟𝑗 for intercept 0 . 29 0 . 31 0 . 30 𝑢 0𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑘 for intercept 0 . 75 0 . 73 0 . 73 𝑢 3𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑘 for DIST MEAN 0 . 03 Model fit statistics Deviance 511 . 39 505 . 13 505 . 06 AIC 521 . 39 517 . 13 521 . 06 m p < . 10 ; * p < . 05 ; * * p < . 01 ; * * * p < . 001 ; 95 % CI ( Wald ) = [ lower , upper ] As shown in Figure 11 , as DIST MEAN increases , Pr ( shortlist ) approaches that of non - citing concepts , again suggesting ( as with DIST MAX ) that the most beneficial sources appear to be ones that are relatively close to the challenge domain . 44 Figure 11 . Model - fitted and observed relationship between DIST MEAN and Pr ( shortlist ) . Fitted values evaluated at mean values of feedback and source shortlist . Observed points are in equal N quartile bins . Vertical and horizontal error bars for points are 95 % CI for Pr ( shortlist ) and DIST MEAN . 3 . 2 . 2 . 3 Robustness and sensitivity analysis I first tested the robustness of these coefficient estimates to outliers by calculating outlier influence statistics using the influence . measures method in the stats package in R , applied to logistic regression model variants of both the DIST MEAN and DIST MAX models ( i . e . , without author - and challenge - level variance components ; coefficient estimates are almost identical to the fixed slope multilevel models ) : DFBETAS and Cook’s Distance measures were below recommended thresholds for all data points ( Fox , 2002 ) , indicating that these results are unlikely to be unduly influenced by outlier concepts . Next , to address potential concerns about overfitting to singleton authors ( i . e . , authors with only one posted concept in the sample ) , I collapsed singleton authors into a single ID and refitted the fixed slope model . The resulting 45 model was almost identical in terms of its fit to the data ( deviance = 506 . 50 ) and coefficient estimate for DIST MEAN ( B = – . 39 [ – . 70 , – . 09 ] ) . To address potential concerns about sensitivity to topic model parameter settings , I also fitted the same fixed slope multilevel models using recomputed conceptual distance measures for the top 20 ( best - fitting ) topic models at K = 200 , 300 , 400 , 500 , and 600 ( total of 100 models ) . Due to computational constraints , I checked robustness only for the models with DIST MEAN . Figure 12 shows the results of this analysis : attending first to the solid black dots ( and their relationship to the red dashed line and the gray horizontal bar ) , we see that all models estimate Figure 12 . Coefficient estimate for DIST mean by topic model K . Solid black dots are point estimates for each model , with a loess line fitted to the relationship between K and point estimate size . Pluses and minuses are 95 % lower and upper limits , respectively for those models . Dashed red line indicates point estimate for DIST mean reported above , with 95 % CI represented with the horizontal gray bar . 46 negative coefficients for DIST MEAN , with many of comparable magnitude to the model reported above , and almost all within the 95 % confidence interval from the model above . Attending next to the loess smoothed line fitted to the point estimates and K , we see a relatively flat line , indicating that the sign and magnitude of the estimated effect of DIST MEAN do not appear to be dependent on K . Finally , attending to the spread of the pluses and minuses ( relative to the horizontal gray bar ) , we see that the level of uncertainty in the magnitude of the effect is slightly larger when considering all 100 models , but is relatively independent of K . This robustness analysis thus shows that results reported here do not depend on a particular setting of K , and that the coefficient estimate , though slightly larger in magnitude than the larger sample of models , is not simply an outlier estimate , lending confidence in the robustness and validity of the results . 3 . 3 DISCUSSION To summarize , the data provide no support for the Conceptual Leap Hypothesis ; on the contrary , overreliance on far sources , measured by either DIST MAX or DIST MEAN , is associated with worse innovative outcomes ; said differently , the benefits of building on inspirations seem to accrue mainly for concepts that build more on near than far inspirations , with far inspirations that are not on the tail end of the distance continuum . Importantly , these effects were robust across challenges , addressing concerns raised about potential problem variation , at least among non - routine social innovation design problems . Additionally , addressing potential concerns about noise in my use of LDA to measure distance , a logistic regression model fitted with the two challenges for which I have human judgments of continuous distance ( i . e . , the bone - marrow and 47 e - waste challenges ) returns a very similar estimate of the effect of distance , albeit with more noise due to lack of statistical power ( B = – 0 . 65 [ – 2 . 13 , 0 . 88 ] ) . Some might be concerned with a lack of statistical power to detect problem variation , if it exists , given that I only have 12 challenges . The estimates of the size of the variance components for DIST MAX and DIST MEAN help to mitigate this concern , and plotting each coefficient by challenge ( estimated with the random slope models ; see Figure 13 ) shows that all challenges have negative coefficients , with very little variability between challenges . This gives us further confidence that the negative effects observed for DIST MAX and DIST MEAN are not driven by any particular challenge , but rather are consistent patterns observed across challenges . Figure 13 . Coefficients for DIST MAX and DIST MEAN estimated by challenge with random slopes models , with 95 % CIs . Dot size corresponds to the number of sampled concepts in the challenge , to give a sense of the challenge’s contribution to the overall estimate . 48 4 . 0 CONCEPTUAL DISTANCE FROM SOLUTION PATH This chapter considers an alternative conceptualization of source distance , i . e . , defined with respect to the particular solution ( or concept ) one is considering . It could be argued that the breakthrough effect of far sources of inspiration may be most evident if the sources are far from one’s “specific location” in the conceptual space ( i . e . , the specific concept being considered ) , rather than from one’s “general location” ( i . e . , the general problem domain , as in Chapter 3 ) . From a psychological standpoint , considering sources that are conceptually very different from the solution one is considering could cause one to reconsider one’s solution approach , and explore novel iterations on ( or alternatives to ) one’s solution approach ; it is possible that sources that are far from the problem domain may nevertheless be familiar , whereas sources that are far from the particular concept may be more likely to be novel and inspiring . Conversely , one could be inspired by sources that are near to the problem but are nevertheless far from one’s solution path ( i . e . , very different ideas than what one has previously considered , but are nevertheless still within the problem domain ) . Thus , problem distance might be too coarse a measure to capture the benefits of conceptual distance of sources , and analyzing how the distance of inspiration sources from their inspired concept ( rather than the problem ) may provide a more precise / sensitive test of the Conceptual Leap Hypothesis . 49 4 . 1 METHODS Distance from self ( hereafter denoted DISTSELF ) was measured for each concept by measuring and reversing the cosine ( i . e . , subtracting from 0 , to derive distance rather than similarity ) between that concept and each of its cited inspirations . For analysis , these distances were summarized into two measures : 1 ) DISTSELF MEAN , which is the mean of the distances , and 2 ) DISTSELF MAX , which is the maximum of the distances ( measuring the furthest a concept went from its own conceptual space ) . Having established ( in Chapter 3 ) distance from the problem as a useful predictor of Pr ( shortlist ) , I now ask whether adding DISTSELF MEAN or DISTSELF MAX ( I fit separate models because of their high intercorrelation ) to the model improves our predictive power . I select DIST MEAN due to its slightly superior precision and fit . 4 . 2 RESULTS 4 . 2 . 1 Descriptive Statistics Table 7 shows descriptive statistics for the DISTSELF predictors , along with their bivariate correlations with the other variables . Notably , they do not correlate strongly with DIST MEAN , validating our choice to examine them separately rather than treating them as the same construct . No other strong correlations with the other predictors give initial cause for concern over 50 Table 7 : Descriptive statistics for DISTSELF measures and correlations with other variables DISTSELF MEAN DISTSELF MAX Descriptives Min - 0 . 93 - 0 . 93 Max - 0 . 01 - 0 . 01 Median - 0 . 22 - 0 . 11 Mean - 0 . 26 - 0 . 18 SD 0 . 17 0 . 18 Correlations SHORTLIST - 0 . 06 m - 0 . 04 FEEDBACK - 0 . 01 0 . 05 SOURCESHORT 0 . 11 * * 0 . 13 * * * DIST MEAN 0 . 13 * * * 0 . 10 * * DISTSELF MEAN 0 . 86 * * * m p < . 10 ; * p < . 05 ; * * p < . 01 ; * * * p < . 001 multicollinearity . A simple test of multicollinearity using a simple linear regression of SHORTLIST on all other covariates and DISTSELF MAX and DISTSELF MEAN separately confirms that multicollinearity is not a concern ( variance inflation factor = 1 . 05 for both DISTSELF MAX and DISTSELF MEAN ) . As with distance from the problem , DISTSELF MAX and DISTSELF MEAN are highly correlated , and estimated variance inflation factors of 4 . 15 and 4 . 13 motivate examining them separately . 51 4 . 2 . 2 Statistical Models As before , I fit a series of generalized linear mixed models with glmer in R using full maximum likelihood estimation by the Laplace approximation , with concepts cross - classified within both authors and challenges . Both DISTSELF predictors were rescaled to range from – 10 to 0 ( by multiplying them by 10 ) , since a 1 - unit change on the original - 1 to 0 scale would not be meaningful ( i . e . , would span the whole range of the variable ) . 4 . 2 . 2 . 1 Max distance from self Consider first the model for DISTSELF MAX . Adding DISTSELF MAX to the best - fitting model ( with only controls and DIST MEAN ) from before results in a small reduction in deviance that also fails a likelihood ratio test of statistical significance ,  2 ( 1 ) = 2 . 21 , p = 0 . 14 , and an increase in the AIC to 517 . 50 ( see Table 8 ) . The model estimates a very similar ( albeit smaller and less precise ) effect to DIST MEAN , i . e . , a slightly negative effect , with an increase of . 10 in DISTSELF MAX associated with a decrease of approximately . 19 in the log - odds of being shortlisted . Figure 14 shows the best - fitting line relating DISTSELF MAX to Pr ( shortlist ) , holding all other covariates at their mean values . Adding a random effect of challenge on DISTSELF MAX does not meaningfully decrease deviance from the simpler fixed effects model ,  2 ( 2 ) = 0 . 08 , p = . 48 ( p - value is halved to correct for overconservativeness ) , and also further increases AIC to 520 . 83 . 52 Table 8 : Model estimates and fit statistics for cross - classified multilevel logistic regressions of Pr ( shortlist ) on DISTSELF MAX , with comparison to baseline model ( fixed DIST MEAN ) Baseline model ( fixed DIST MEAN ) DISTSELF MAX , fixed slope DISTSELF MAX , random slope Fixed effects 𝛾 00 , intercept – 2 . 74 [ – 3 . 36 , – 2 . 11 ] – 2 . 95 [ – 3 . 64 , – 2 . 26 ] – 2 . 95 [ – 3 . 91 , – 2 . 17 ] 𝛾 10 , FEEDBACK 0 . 10 * * * [ 0 . 07 , 0 . 12 ] 0 . 10 * * * [ 0 . 07 , 0 . 12 ] 0 . 10 * * * [ 0 . 07 , 0 . 12 ] 𝛾 20 , SOURCESHORT 0 . 13 [ – 0 . 09 , 0 . 35 ] 0 . 15 [ – 0 . 08 , 0 . 37 ] 0 . 15 [ – 0 . 08 , 0 . 38 ] 𝛾 30 , DIST MEAN – 0 . 40 * [ – 0 . 71 , – 0 . 09 ] – 0 . 36 * [ – 0 . 67 , – 0 . 05 ] – 0 . 36 * [ – 0 . 69 , – 0 . 06 ] 𝛾 40 , DISTSELF MAX – 0 . 10 [ – 0 . 24 , 0 . 03 ] – 0 . 10 [ – 0 . 27 , 0 . 08 ] Random effects 𝑢 0𝑎𝑢𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑟𝑗 for intercept 0 . 31 0 . 30 0 . 29 𝑢 0𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑘 for intercept 0 . 73 0 . 74 0 . 80 𝑢 3𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑘 for DISTSELF MAX 0 . 00 Model fit statistics Deviance 505 . 13 502 . 92 502 . 83 AIC 517 . 13 516 . 92 520 . 83 m p < . 10 ; * p < . 05 ; * * p < . 01 ; * * * p < . 001 ; 95 % CI ( Wald ) = [ lower , upper ] 53 Figure 14 .

Adding DISTSELF MEAN to the best - fitting model from before results in a small reduction in deviance : however , this reduction fails a likelihood ratio test of statistical significance at the conventional . 05 level ,  2 ( 1 ) = 1 . 58 , p = 0 . 21 , and increases AIC from the previous best - fitting model’s AIC of 517 . 13 ( see Table 9 ) . The lack of improvement notwithstanding , the model estimates a slightly negative effect of DISTSELF MEAN , with an increase of . 10 being associated 54 with a decrease of approximately . 10 in the log - odds of being shortlisted ( note , however , that the confidence interval indicates that the effect could be very slightly positive ) .

As with DIST MEAN , there does not appear to be problem variation : adding a random effect of challenge on DISTSELF MEAN does not meaningfully decrease deviance from the simpler fixed effects model ,  2 ( 2 ) = 1 . 18 , p = . 28 ( p - value is halved as before ) , and also further increases AIC to 520 . 37 . The estimated challenge - level variance is also near - zero . 56 4 . 3 DISCUSSION The analyses in this chapter were conducted to explore a potentially more precise test of the Conceptual Leap Hypothesis , with the assumption that problem distance might be too coarse a measure to capture the true benefits of conceptual distance ( which might accrue from soruces that are far from one’s solution path , not the problem per se ) . Overall , the results of this analysis were very similar to that of the previous chapter . Despite the relative statistical independence of the two kinds of distance measures ( problem vs . self , with r < . 15 ) , we saw very similar ( albeit significantly smaller and noisier ) trends in the negative direction for the effect of the DISTSELF measures . Thus , as before , I find no support for the Conceptual Leap Hypothesis , and instead find a similar opposition to it , i . e . , greater distance of sources appears to decrease creative success . No significant problem variation was detected . It is worth noting that the effect of DIST MEAN , remained robust to the inclusion of the DISTSELF measures in the models . These results , then , both strengthen and broaden the findings from Chapter 3 . There remains strong evidence that building more on sources that are far from the problem is associated with lower creative success , and that this is not simply an artifact of a noisy measure that is poorly calibrated to theory : even when we consider distance directly from one’s solution path , overreliance on far sources can harm creative success . 57 5 . 0 CONCEPTUAL DIVERSITY The previous two chapters examined the Conceptual Leap Hypothesis from two complementary angles , measuring distance from both the problem and self . This chapter examines the Conceptual Combination Hypothesis ( i . e . , far combinations of sources provide better insights for creative breakthroughs than near combinations ) , and also seeks to further examine the robustness of the negative effect of problem distance , and whether or how it might interact with conceptual diversity of sources . 5 . 1 METHODS 5 . 1 . 1 Sample The sample for this analysis is a subset of the 707 concepts that cite at least 2 inspirations ( since diversity is undefined for sets of size < 2 ) . The 456 concepts that cite at least 2 inspirations constitute the sample for this analysis ( see Table 10 for a breakdown by challenge ) . It is important to note that statistical power is now likely to be severely reduced , not simply because of the overall reduction in N ( and also by challenge ) , but also the difficulty of estimating predictions for so few shortlist cases ( < 4 for four challenges ) . 58 Table 10 : Descriptions and number of posts for OpenIDEO challenges in diversity analysis sample Challenge Num . inspirations ( % diff from previous ) Num . concepts ( % diff from previous ) Num . shortlisted ( % diff from previous ) Bone - marrow 170 ( 9 % ) 31 ( 56 % ) 3 ( 57 % ) Community - initiative 159 ( 1 % ) 36 ( 18 % ) 9 ( 18 % ) E - waste 58 ( 3 % ) 18 ( 31 % ) 5 ( 38 % ) Food - production - consumption 256 ( 4 % ) 85 ( 42 % ) 7 ( 30 % ) Human - rights 246 ( 1 % ) 45 ( 27 % ) 6 ( 14 % ) Identify - celebrate 119 ( 2 % ) 14 ( 42 % ) 8 ( 38 % ) Social - business 126 ( 4 % ) 38 ( 17 % ) 8 ( 27 % ) Social - impact 63 ( 6 % ) 24 ( 40 % ) 7 ( 42 % ) Vibrant - cities 546 ( 2 % ) 81 ( 32 % ) 11 ( 15 % ) Voting 236 ( 2 % ) 32 ( 32 % ) 4 ( 50 % ) Web - entrepreneurs 76 ( 14 % ) 28 ( 43 % ) 2 ( 71 % ) Youth - employment 112 ( 5 % ) 24 ( 25 % ) 2 ( 33 % ) 5 . 1 . 2 Measures Diversity ( hereafter denoted DIV ) was measured for each concept by measuring and reversing all pairwise cosines ( i . e . , subtracting from 0 , to derive distance rather than similarity ) between inspirations cited by that concept . 59 5 . 2 RESULTS 5 . 2 . 1 Descriptive Statistics Table 11 summarizes the descriptive statistics and intercorrelations between the variables . There are statistically significant positive correlations between the control variables and Pr ( shortlist ) . There are no strong inter - correlations between the predictor variables , alleviating potential concerns about multicollinearity ; a variance inflation analysis also shows that having DIV and DIST MEAN in the same model should not introduce multicollinearity , with variance inflation factors of 1 . 16 for both variables .

I rescale DIV ( multiplying it by 10 ) for easier interpretation ( a more meaningful “1 - unit” change ) . As before , I find that there is significant nesting for the reduced set of 456 concepts . The intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC ) for author - nesting is approximately 0 . 14 ( again using the approximation for level - 1 residuals from Zeger et al , 1988 ) , indicating that approximately 14 % of the total variability in Pr ( shortlist ) lies between authors . Similarly , the ICC estimate for challenge - nesting is approximately 0 . 09 , indicating that approximately 9 % of the total variability in P ( shortlist ) lies between challenges . Both ICC values are well above conventional cut - offs for ICCs ( e . g . , as recommended by Raudenbush & Bryk , 2002 ) , and both higher - level random effects are statistically significant using a nested likelihood ratio test ( comparing the cross - classified with a challenge - nesting only and author - nesting only model ) ,  2 ( 1 ) = 4 . 41 , p < . 05 and  2 ( 1 ) = 4 . 52 , p < . 05 , for author - and challenge - level variance respectively . Table 12 presents the model estimates and fit statistics for these models . As before , I use a model with the controls variables and DIST MEAN as a baseline for comparing what is added by DIV . The baseline model gives a large and statistically significant reduction in deviance compared to the null model ,  2 ( 2 ) = 64 . 70 , p = 0 . 00 . Adding a fixed slope for DIV to this model does not provide any meaningful reduction in deviance , with the likelihood ratio being essentially zero ,  61 Table 12 : Model estimates and fit statistics for cross - classified multilevel logistic regressions of Pr ( shortlist ) on DIV , with comparison to baseline model ( controls and DIST MEAN ) Baseline model ( controls and DIST MEAN ) With DIV , fixed slope With DIV random slope Fixed effects 𝛾 00 , intercept – 3 . 08 [ – 3 . 37 , – 2 . 12 ] – 3 . 05 [ – 3 . 99 , – 2 . 12 ] – 3 . 03 [ – 4 . 11 , – 1 . 95 ] 𝛾 10 , FEEDBACK 0 . 10 * * * [ 0 . 07 , 0 . 12 ] 0 . 10 * * * [ 0 . 07 , 0 . 13 ] 0 . 10 * * * [ 0 . 07 , 0 . 13 ] 𝛾 20 , SOURCESHORT 0 . 25 m [ – 0 . 10 , 0 . 35 ] 0 . 25 m [ – 0 . 03 , 0 . 52 ] 0 . 26 m [ – 0 . 03 , 0 . 54 ] 𝛾 30 , DIST MEAN – 0 . 49 m [ – 0 . 71 , 0 . 10 ] – 0 . 50 m [ – 1 . 05 , 0 . 04 ] – 0 . 54 * [ – 1 . 08 , – 0 . 00 ] 𝛾 40 , DIV 0 . 01 [ – 0 . 27 , 0 . 30 ] 0 . 03 [ – 0 . 28 , 0 . 33 ] Random effects 𝑢 0𝑎𝑢𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑟𝑗 0 . 47 0 . 47 0 . 44 𝑢 0𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑘 0 . 71 0 . 71 1 . 63 𝑢 1𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑒𝑛𝑔𝑒𝑘 0 . 05 Model fit statistics Deviance 323 . 57 323 . 57 321 . 74 AIC 335 . 57 337 . 57 339 . 74 m p < . 10 ; * p < . 05 ; * * p < . 01 ; * * * p < . 001 ; 95 % CI ( Wald ) = [ lower , upper ] 62 Figure 16 .

The point estimate for the effect of a change in . 10 ( remember that DIV is rescaled in this model ) is also essentially zero ( albeit with a fairly wide confidence interval ) . To ensure that this wide confidence interval is not due to large problem variation , I estimate an additional model with a random slope for DIV . This model estimates essentially zero challenge - variance , does not meaningfully decrease variance from the fixed slope model ,  2 ( 2 ) = 1 . 83 , p = . 23 ( p - value is halved , as before ) , and also further increases AIC . Figure 16 shows this estimated zero effect of DIV in relation to observed Pr ( shortlist ) for 4 equal N bins ( with 95 % CIs ) . There does not appear to be a discernible trend , except perhaps a slight drop - off in Pr ( shortlist ) at extreme values of DIV ( i . e . , when most sources are very far from each other ) . 63 5 . 3 DISCUSSION The purpose of this chapter was to test the Conceptual Combination Hypothesis , and also further explore the robustness of the negative effect of problem distance . Overall , this analysis did not support the Conceptual Combination Hypothesis , although the high attrition from the initial sample of 707 concepts , and the wide confidence intervals ( relative to the estimated effect ) give cause for caution in interpreting this as a “strong null” ( i . e . , confident estimated zero effect ) . With regards to the robustness of the effect of problem distance , the estimated negative effect appears to be robust to conceptual diversity , although the uncertainty in the estimate is higher , probably due in part to the lack of statistical power . I also find no evidence that they interact in important ways , at least in this data , although the lack of statistical power means interactions should not necessarily be ruled out for future analyses . Thus , these results continue to strengthen the findings from Chapter 3 : regardless of conceptual diversity , overreliance on sources that are conceptually far from one’s problem leads to lower creative success , contrary to the Conceptual Leap Hypothesis . 64 6 . 0 INDIRECT EFFECTS OF DISTANCE In this chapter I consider the possibility of “indirect effects” . The analyses in this chapter are inspired in part by von Wartburg , Teichert , and Rost’s ( 2005 ) multi - stage analysis of patent citation paths and technological lineages . There are theoretical reasons to suppose that considering indirect sources may provide additional , potentially different , insights into the effects of the conceptual distance inspiration sources . For instance , it could be that the benefits of distance can often be overwhelmed by the cognitive costs of mapping / adapting far sources , or sifting through potentially irrelevant inferences from far sources . Concepts that build on other inspirations or concepts that have already mapped or processed these far sources may be able to benefit from their sparks without paying the costs of being the first to process them . Relatedly , far sources may not yield immediately usable ideas : they may be novel , but require additional processing in order to be useful for the problem . Thus , I might expect to see different results when considering the conceptual distance of indirect sources ( i . e . , sources cited by immediately cited sources ) , more in line with the Conceptual Leap Hypothesis . Let us first consider effects of distance from the problem . 65 6 . 1 METHODS 6 . 1 . 1 Measures To gather indirect sources for a given concept , a conceptual genealogy for that concept was constructed via breadth - first search through the citation graph gathered in initial data collection : this search first returned all sources that concept built upon , and then returned all sources that each of these sources built upon ( whether they were concepts or inspirations ) , traversing the conceptual tree to its endpoint . This search procedure was programmed to ignore duplicate entries : for instance , if an inspiration I was a direct source for a concept C ( at level 1 ) , and also for another concept / inspiration at level 2 , it would only be counted once as a level 1 source for C . I defined “indirect” inspirations as inspirations from levels 2 to 4 of each concept’s genealogy ( see Figure 17 ) : this cut - off , while seemingly arbitrary , reflects our goal of examining the effects of sources that are “just recent enough” to have discernible effects ( we may not be able to distinguish the effects of sources that are too deep in a genealogy ) , while having sufficient genealogical depth to allow for iteration and “preprocessing” of sources to occur . Notice from Figure 17 that indirect sources would also include inspirations cited by cited concepts ( i . e . , the sources of concepts that acted as immediate sources for the root concept ) . One way to think about this relationship of the root concept with these indirect sources of other concepts is that ( at least part of ) the insights / information / ideas contained in those inspirations are “passed on” to the root concept through their incorporation into the concepts immediately cited by the root concept . 66 Figure 17 . Illustrated example conceptual genealogy and operationalization of “indirect” sources as sources in levels 2 to 4 of the genealogy . Teal circles denote concepts ; maroon circles denote inspirations . As before , I computed max and mean distance measures for each inspiration source set ( here denoted IND - DIST MAX and IND - DIST MEAN . 6 . 1 . 2 Sample Because I wanted to control for effects of immediate distance of sources , and not all immediately cited inspirations themselves cited inspirations , the sample for this analysis was reduced from 707 to 568 total concepts that both cited at least one immediate inspiration and included at least one inspiration in levels 2 to 4 of their genealogy .

Note that the overall mean Pr ( shortlist ) remains substantially similar to the initial sample of 707 concepts ( i . e . , ~ 15 % compared to 16 % in the original sample ) . No bivariate correlations give cause for concern over multicollinearity , and it is interesting to note that the IND - DIST measures are only weakly ( if at all ) related to DIST MEAN , giving some confidence that they measure a ( at least statistically ) distinct construct .

To ensure that this high uncertainty is not due to problem variation , I also estimated a random effect of challenge on the slope of IND - DIST MAX . This model estimates a near - zero challenge - level variance component , and does not meaningfully reduce deviance from the fixed slope model ,  2 ( 2 ) = 0 . 49 , p = 0 . 39 ( halved ) .

Coefficients for IND - DIST MEAN estimated by challenge with random slopes models , with 95 % CIs , with dots sized by number of sampled concepts in challenge . IND - DIST MEAN did not meaningfully reduce deviance ,  2 ( 1 ) = 0 . 31 , p = 0 . 58 , fitting an additional model with a random effect of challenge on the slope of IND - DIST MEAN did meaningfully reduce deviance from the fixed slope model ,  2 ( 2 ) = 4 . 64 , p = 0 . 049 ( halved ) , and estimated a challenge - level variance component of comparable size to the challenge - level variance in Pr ( shortlist ) . However , this random - slopes model’s reduction in deviance from the baseline model falls short of conventional statistical significance ,  2 ( 3 ) = 5 . 27 , p = 0 . 15 , and has a slightly higher AIC ( 413 . 27 vs . 412 . 53 ) . Figure 19 shows that there appears to be a relatively even split between the challenges in terms of a positive vs . negative effect of IND - DIST MEAN : five challenges have a negative coefficient ( in line with the analyses of immediate sources ; note , however , the increased size of 74 the coefficients ) , five challenge have a relatively small positive coefficient , and two have a near - zero coefficient . 6 . 3 DISCUSSION This chapter examined the possibility that the effects of problem distance might be different for indirect sources ( e . g . , additional iteration might be necessary to “convert” novel but raw ideas inspired by far sources into good ideas ) . The analyses showed that the effects of indirect max distance look very similar to that of immediate max distance ( negative effect with no problem variation ) , albeit with far greater uncertainty ( and a smaller coefficient ) . In contrast , there are some hints of problem - variant effects of indirect mean distance : at least for some challenges , there seems to be an estimated positive effect of IND - DIST MEAN , more in line with the Conceptual Leap Hypothesis , and in keeping with the idea that the benefits of far sources might only start to show if they have been “preprocessed” by other ideas before being built upon . What could explain this problem - variation ? One conservative interpretation would be that the variation ( specifically , the estimated positive effects ) is an artifact of imprecise estimates for the smaller challenges ( with fewer observations ) in this sample : indeed , as is evident in Figure 19 , the challenges with larger N do tend to have a more negative coefficient , r = – . 71 [ – . 91 , – . 23 ] , p < . 01 . In light of the robust negative effect of immediate distance of sources , one might suspect that the more positive estimates from the smaller challenges might be statistical flukes , and be more inclined to trust the negative estimates from the larger challenges : by analogy to statistical power and precision , with fewer samples of ideas built on far indirect - sources , there is a higher 75 chance that the mean effect of those sources appears to be positive , but perhaps we begin to converge on the true distribution ( i . e . , mean negative effect ) with more samples . Alternatively , it may be more difficult for the expert panels to find “hidden gems” in larger challenges . Recall that the panels use community “upvotes” as one signal of concept potential , but also strive to find highly innovative concepts that may have slipped through the Figure 20 . Coefficients for IND - DISTmean estimated by challenge with random slopes models , with 95 % CIs , with dots sized by ( A ) total number of concepts in challenge , and ( B ) Pr ( shortlist ) for challenge . cracks : if concepts built on relatively far indirect sources ( controlling for immediate distance ) are likely to be more innovative , but potentially less recognizable as such by the community ( thereby leading to lower numbers of upvotes ) , then the expert panel may have an easier time picking out these hidden gems in smaller challenges ( where they will not have to sift through as many concepts ) , and therefore allow for positive effects of distance to emerge . Indeed , challenges with more total concepts ( i . e . , not just concepts in our analysis sample ) tend to have a less positive slope for IND - DIST MEAN , r = – . 66 [ – . 89 , – . 14 ] , p < . 05 ( see Figure 20 A ) . However , it is not clear whether finding hidden gems is that much more effortful ( or at least sufficiently more effortful to 76 support this interpretation of the problem variation ) for the larger challenges , since ( apart from the three large challenges that have N of ~ 300 or more , i . e . , bone - marrow , vibrant - cities , and food - production - consumption ) , there is relatively little variation among the remaining challenges , with most being around 100 - 150 concepts . A related explanation may involve variations in “choosiness” : since the expert panel shortlists a relatively fixed number of concepts for each challenge ( ~ 20 ) , challenges with more concepts ( higher participation ) are necessarily more “selective” – that is , the expert panel shortlists a much smaller subset of the submitted concepts . In more selective challenges ( with higher levels of participation ) , the bar for quality might be higher , and the expert panel might be a little more risk averse : in less selective challenges , they may be more willing to risk their selection on ideas that are very novel but perhaps of lesser immediate quality . Indeed , challenges with higher Pr ( shortlist ) ( i . e . , less selective challenges ) tend to have a more positive slope for IND - DIST MEAN , r = . 78 [ . 37 , . 94 ] , p < . 01 ( see Figure 20 B ) . However , it is not clear how or why lower selectivity might lead to a positive ( rather than simply neutral ) effect of IND - DIST MEAN We would also need separate novelty and quality ratings of concepts to be able to more directly test the risk aversion explanation . Leaving aside these statistical or incidental explanations , it could be that there is some other underlying psychologically meaningful challenge - level characteristic that I have not measured that explains the problem variation . For example , Kavadias and Sommer ( 2009 ) show by theoretical mathematical analysis that problem complexity could moderate the benefits of team knowledge diversity . However , qualitative examination of the challenges did not show obvious variations in problem complexity , particularly in a way that covaried with the effect of IND - DIST MEAN . Nevertheless , it is possible that with a larger sample , and more focused inquiry , 77 complexity might turn out to show a correlation , or other explanatory variables might be discovered . Overall , I conclude by noting the general concordance of this analysis with the analysis of immediate sources : both analyses find little direct support for the Conceptual Leap Hypothesis , i . e . , generally negative estimated effects . From a larger perspective , too , the finding that there might be problem - dependent ( or at least problem - varying ) positive effects of mean distance of indirect sources ( bearing in mind the aforementioned statistical caveats ) suggests value in incorporating the dimension of temporality ( or genealogy , e . g . , by distinguishing between immediate and indirect sources ) in examining the effects of inspiration sources . Thus , the approach and methodology will be extended to the remaining two chapters , exploring how distance from self and diversity might vary with the immediacy of the sources . 78 7 . 0 INDIRECT EFFECTS OF DISTANCE FROM SOLUTION PATH Having established the possibility of different effects of distance from the problem depending on the “directness” of the sources , I now consider potentially different effects of the distance of indirect sources from one’s solution path . In Chapter 4 , I showed that , despite their conceptual distinction , distance from the problem and distance from self showed very similar ( i . e . , negative ) effects on creative success . Nevertheless , the same arguments concerning precision of the distance measure might apply when considering distance of indirect sources , and it is possible that we might see positive effects of distance of indirect sources from one’s solution path , given the hints at positive effects of problem distance ( for some problems ) seen in the previous chapter . 79 7 . 1 METHODS The sample ( both concepts and indirect sources ) for this analysis was the same as in the previous chapter . As with immediate distance from self , we computed 1 ) IND - DISTSELF MAX , the maximum of the distances of the indirect sources from the root concept , and 2 ) IND - DISTSELF MEAN , the mean of the distances . 7 . 2 RESULTS 7 . 2 . 1 Descriptive Statistics Table 18 shows descriptive statistics for the IND - DISTSELF predictors , along with their bivariate correlations with the other variables .

Mean Similar results are found with IND - DISTSELF MEAN as with IND - DIST MEAN .

This random - slopes model’s reduction in deviance from the baseline model falls just short of conventional statistical significance ,  2 ( 3 ) = 6 . 99 , p = 0 . 07 , but has a slightly lower AIC ( 411 . 54 vs . 412 . 53 ) . Figure 22 shows how , similarly to IND - DIST MEAN , there only seems to be a hint of a positive effect of IND - DISTSELF MEAN for a subset of the challenges ( 4 here , compared with 5 from before ) . 7 . 3 DISCUSSION The purpose of this chapter was to explore the possibility that distance of indirect sources from one’s solution path might show different effects than the distance of immediate sources . The analyses produced substantially similar results to that of the previous chapter : indirect max 85 distance from self has a small mean negatively trending slope with no problem variation ( with high uncertainty ) , and there are some hints of problem - variant effects of indirect mean distance ( although with slightly more precision than before ) . However , interpretation of the problem variation is slightly at variance with the previous chapter : as Figure 22 showed , the variation seemed to be mostly about the magnitude of the negative effect , rather than with the sign of the effect . Further , the potential explanations ( e . g . , statistical precision , judge effort , and judge choosiness ) for problem variation with distance from the problem ( from the previous chapter ) seem to be slightly less applicable here : the correlation of the effect with the number of concepts in the challenge sample was smaller than in the previous chapter , r = – . 58 [ – . 87 , – . 01 ] , p < . 05 ( compared to r = - . 71 from before ) ; correlation with the total number of concepts was r = – . 53 [ – . 85 , . 06 ] , p < . 10 ( vs . – . 66 from before ) ; and the correlation with Pr ( shortlist ) was r = . 53 [ – . 06 , . 85 ] , p < . 10 ( vs . . 78 from before ) . Additionally , the fit of the random effects model ( with problem variation ) seems to be at least slightly better than the fixed effects and controls - only model ( with a lower AIC as well ) . Thus , while the uncertainty in the problem variation effect is still relatively high , we have slightly less reason to believe that it is an artifact of statistical confounds or noise : for indirect sources , then , it seems that increased distance from the solution path may not always negatively impact creative success , and may in some cases even slightly improve it . It is also worth noting yet again that the negative effect of immediate problem distance remained robust in this analysis , further underscoring its validity . Additionally , the similarity between these results and those of the previous chapter ( in terms of finding different patterns of results for immediate vs . indirect sources ) further underscores the potential value of examining immediacy of sources as a potential moderator . 86 8 . 0 CHAPTER 8 : INDIRECT EFFECTS OF DIVERSITY Having seen potential variations in the effects of source distance by the “directness” of the sources , I now consider the possibility that conceptual diversity may also have different effects when it is “indirect” vs . direct . By similar logic , far combinations may yield novel ideas that require further refinement in order to be useful ( and therefore creative ) : thus , we might expect to see different results when considering the conceptual diversity of indirect sources ( i . e . , sources cited by immediately cited sources ) , more in line with the Conceptual Leap Combination Hypothesis . 87 8 . 1 METHODS As with indirect distance , I consider indirect sources as sources in levels 2 to 4 of a concept’s genealogy . Indirect diversity ( here termed IND - DIV ) was computed the same way as with direct diversity ( i . e . , by averaging pairwise distances between all indirect inspirations ) . The sample for this analysis again was a subset of the initial sample of 707 concepts . To analyze diversity of sources , at least two sources in a set are needed , and not all 707 concepts both cited at least one immediate inspiration and at least two indirect inspirations : only 522 concepts met both criteria : the breakdown of this sample by challenge is given in Table 21 . 88 Table 21 : Descriptions and number of posts for OpenIDEO challenges in indirect diversity analysis sample Challenge Num . concepts ( % diff from previous ) Num . shortlisted ( % diff from previous ) Bone - marrow 46 ( 35 % ) 5 ( 29 % ) Community - initiative 32 ( 27 % ) 7 ( 36 % ) E - waste 20 ( 23 % ) 6 ( 25 % ) Food - production - consumption 100 ( 32 % ) 8 ( 20 % ) Human - rights 54 ( 13 % ) 6 ( 14 % ) Identify - celebrate 11 ( 54 % ) 7 ( 46 % ) Social - business 39 ( 15 % ) 9 ( 18 % ) Social - impact 31 ( 23 % ) 7 ( 42 % ) Vibrant - cities 98 ( 18 % ) 11 ( 15 % ) Voting 38 ( 19 % ) 8 ( 0 % ) Web - entrepreneurs 32 ( 35 % ) 3 ( 57 % ) Youth - employment 21 ( 34 % ) 2 ( 33 % ) 89 8 . 2 RESULTS 8 . 2 . 1 Descriptive Statistics Descriptive statistics and bivariate correlations are given in Table 22 and Table 23 . IND - DIV does not have any strong correlations with the other predictors , giving little cause for concerns about multicollinearity .

I use a model with the controls variables and DIST MEAN as a baseline for comparing what is added by IND - DIV . The baseline model gives a large and statistically significant reduction in deviance compared to the null model ,  2 ( 3 ) = 63 . 70 , p = 0 . 00 . Adding a fixed slope for DIV to this model provides a small but marginally significant reduction in deviance ,  2 ( 1 ) = 3 . 26 , p = 0 . 07 , and a slight decrease in the AIC , mitigating concerns about overfitting . The model estimates that a . 10 change in IND - DIV corresponds to an increase of approximately . 45 in the log - odds of being shortlisted . Holding all the other predictors at their mean values , changing from an IND - DIV of – 0 . 20 ( close to the mean value in the sample ) to – 0 . 10 ) increases Pr ( shortlist ) from 0 . 13 to 0 . 19 .

Observed points are in equal N quartile bins . Vertical and horizontal error bars for points are 95 % CI for Pr ( shortlist ) and IND - DIV . ( with 95 % CIs ) . Although the observed points suggest a potential quadratic relationship , note the relatively wide CIs for Pr ( shortlist ) , and also note that plotting IND - DIV against the residuals from the fixed slope model does not suggest that a quadratic term would add anything . Indeed , a model fitted with a quadratic term for IND - DIV does no better in a likelihood - ratio test vs . the baseline model ,  2 ( 2 ) = 3 . 52 , p = 0 . 17 , and also results in a higher AIC than the model with just a linear term for IND - DIV ( 385 . 12 vs . 383 . 39 ) , suggesting that any additional deviance reduction may be due to overfitting . The estimated positive effect of IND - DIV did not appear to vary by challenge . Fitting an additional model with a random slope for IND - DIV estimates essentially zero challenge - variance , does not meaningfully decrease variance from the fixed slope model ,  2 ( 2 ) = 0 . 26 , p = . 44 ( p - value is halved , as before ) , and also further increases AIC . 93 8 . 3 DISCUSSION In this chapter , I extended the approach and methodology from the previous two chapters , considering how the effects of diversity of sources might be different depending on the sources’ immediacy . Analyzing diversity of indirect sources indeed yields different results than direct diversity ; specifically , the extremely small positive effect of direct diversity is now significantly amplified , to a comparable magnitude as the effect of DIST MEAN ( albeit with considerable uncertainty about the true size of the effect ) . Thus , the Conceptual Combination Hypothesis appears to find at least partial support when considering indirect rather than direct sources : far combinations do appear to benefit one’s creative success , but only if they are “indirect” ( i . e . , sources of one’s sources ) . One potential concern with this analysis is that I did not control for the number of cited inspirations : intuitively , the more inspirations are cited , the higher the likelihood for diverse pairs to exist in the set . Perhaps it is the number of indirect inspirations in a set and not the diversity of those inspirations that matters : it could be that number of indirect inspirations ( which can be thought of as the size of one’s ego network in a given window ) indicates being in a “popular” region of the design space , which in turn is correlated with creative success . But this concern is not borne out in the data . While indirect diversity and the number of indirect inspirations are indeed correlated ( r = . 33 [ 0 . 27 , 0 . 39 ] , p < . 001 ) , including the number of indirect inspirations in the final model does not substantively change the estimate of the effect of indirect diversity ( B = 0 . 46 [ – 0 . 02 , 0 . 94 ] ) . Again , it is worth noting the continued robustness of the negative effect of problem distance for immediate sources . Also , while moving from immediate to indirect sources 94 increased the magnitude of the estimated effect of source diversity ( in contrast to revealing potential problem variation for the effects of distance ) , these results are similar to that of the preceding chapters in that all three chapters demonstrate the potential importance of considering the immediacy of inspiration sources as a potential moderator of their effects . 95 9 . 0 GENERAL DISCUSSION I now conclude this dissertation by summarizing the insights gained and working out their implications for the theory and practice of creative inspiration . 9 . 1 SUMMARY OF FINDINGS This dissertation was conducted to aid in the discovery of principles that can guide the curation and use of sources of inspiration in the creative process . I found two broad related but distinct categories of recommendations commonly found in the literature , which formed the basis for the two main research questions addressed in this dissertation : 3 ) What are the relative benefits of different levels of source conceptual distance for creative outcomes ? 4 ) What are the relative benefits of different levels of source conceptual combination distance for creative outcomes ? Question 1 led to testing of the Conceptual Leap Hypothesis , which postulates that the best creative insights come from high levels of source conceptual distance . I designed this study to address some key potential reasons for mixed empirical findings in prior work , namely time 96 scale , statistical power , and problem variation . I also examined two operationalizations of distance : distance from the problem , and distance from self ( i . e . , the solution path ) . Question 2 led to testing of the Conceptual Combination Hypothesis from prior literature , which posits that better creative insights accrue from higher levels of conceptual combination distance ( or higher diversity of sources ) . This hypothesis was relatively well supported for novelty of results , but not as well for the combination of novelty and quality . Cutting across these two questions , I also wondered about how different levels of immediacy of sources might moderate the effects of these variables : can we trust far sources or combinations to generate immediately usable breakthrough ideas , or do they have to be combined with some other process to produce good ideas ( e . g . , refinement / iteration strategies ) ? Figure 23 summarizes the main findings from this dissertation . For the first major question , this dissertation yielded strong evidence against the Conceptual Leap Hypothesis : far from being a consistent benefit , conceptual distance was found to often be harmful to creative success . The most robust finding was that preferring to directly cite sources that are conceptually far from one’s problem domain resulted in consistently worse creative success : the effect , while estimated with some imprecision , was robust across the different problems on the platform ( see Figure 24 for a summary of problem variation across the different variables ) , robust across different parameter settings for the computational distance measures , and remained unchanged with the addition of distance from self and diversity measures . This negative effect was muted when considering the distance of indirect sources , with consistently negative but much smaller overall effects ( i . e . , averaged across problems ) for both distance from the problem and distance from self . There were some hints of positive effects for some problems when considering only the mean distance from the problem ; however , interpretation of these findings is uncertain given 97 Figure 23 . Summary of effects by variable and source type . Coefficients are standardized by multiplying them by the variable’s standard deviation . Model certainty is approximated by calculating how much lower the Akaike Information Criterion ( AIC ) of the best fitted model with the variable in question and the AIC of its baseline model ( controls only for immediate problem distance , controls plus immediate distance for all other models ) . For reference , the best - fitting model for DIST had an AIC that was lower than its baseline by 4 . 26 points ; in contrast , AIC for the best - fitting model for DIV was higher than its baseline by 2 points . Figure 24 . Summary of degree of problem variation by variable and source type . 98 the high correlations with potential nuisance variation ( e . g . , sample size ) , and lack of available data to test possible explanations for the problem variation . With respect to the second major question , partial support was found for the Conceptual Combination Hypothesis : controlling for mean problem distance of direct sources ( along with other control variables ) , there was a very small ( but statistically insignificant ) estimated positive effect of conceptual combination distance of direct sources ; this positive effect grew larger when considering indirect sources , to a similar size as the negative effect of mean problem distance , but with more uncertainty , and only a marginally significant improvement in model fit when adding a fixed effect of indirect diversity . 9 . 2 CAVEATS AND LIMITATIONS Some caveats and limitations should be discussed before addressing the implications of this dissertation . First , the statistical patterns observed here are conditional : i . e . , I find that increased conceptual distance of cited inspiration sources negatively impacts Pr ( shortlist ) . My data is silent on the effects of distance for concepts that did not cite sources . However , these concepts were overall of lower quality ; thus , it is unlikely that the negative effects of distance are due to attrition ( e . g . , beneficial far inspirations not being observed ) . Nevertheless , we should be cautious about making inferences about the impact of unconscious sources ( since sources in this data are explicitly cited and therefore consciously built upon ) . However , the Conceptual Leap and Conceptual Combination hypotheses may be more applicable to conscious inspiration 99 processes ( e . g . , analogy , for which conscious processing is arguably an important defining feature ; Christensen & Schunn , 2005 ) . Relatedly , some might be concerned about the meaningfulness of citations on this platform : my inference from this data that the use of different kinds of sources can impact creative success depends on the assumption that the sources were actually being used in the development of the concept . This assumption may not actually be warranted : for instance , citations may mainly reflect attempts to give an appearance of quality or primarily serve a social function ( e . g . , gaining attention to solicit feedback ) . There are at least two sources of evidence that address this potential concern . First , in many concepts , the authors do mention not only that a source inspired their idea , but also how . For example , in “E - Life Cycled” ( Reader , 2012 ) , a concept for the e - waste challenge focusing on creating a brand / label for new products manufactured substantially with reprocessed materials ( as a way to set a business’s products apart from the competition ) , the author states that he was “ [ b ] uilding on [ name redacted ] ’s original inspiration for a Brand for " Made from E - Waste " and incorporating [ name redacted ] ’s " E - Life " notion ( raised initially in [ name redacted ] ’s Pure Tech concept ) for renewing and reinvigorating materials from end - of - original - life products…I simply felt the concept [ name redacted ] envisioned was too valuable to leave out of the contributions in this concepting phase . ” The original inspiration “Made from E - waste” proposed a branding campaign modeled after the success of an electronic chip - making company’s ( Intel’s ) successful “Intel Inside” branding campaign . As another example , in “Farmers ' Market ( e ) waste not Booth” ( Shu , 2012 ) , a concept about setting up education and recycling booths at farmer’s markets , the author builds on an insight about human behavior from an inspiration about battery collection efforts in Germany , stating , “ [ g ] iven the popularity of farmers’ markets , they’d be great places to 100 set up an interactive and informative booth where people could learn about electronics recycling and reusing , as well as reducing their electronics consumption . As [ name redacted ] pointed out in her Battery Collection inspiration post , it ' s easier for people to drop off e - waste at a location that they already regularly visit - therefore the booth would also serve as a drop - off spot for unwanted electronics . ” These two examples illustrate how citations to inspirations are meaningful indicators of substantive shaping of concepts by the inspirations they cite . Secondly , as we have seen , concepts that cite inspirations have higher creative success than concepts that do not cite inspirations , controlling for feedback , providing additional evidence that citations are meaningfully involved in the development of concepts , and that observed effects of citations are not due to them serving a “social function” ( e . g . , spurring more attention and feedback , which is what actually improves the concept ) . A second potential caveat is that I have not directly measured novelty here . Conceivably , the benefits of distance or diversity may only be best observed for the novelty of ideas , and not necessarily quality , consistent with some recent work ( Franke , Poetz , & Schreier , 2013 ) . However , novelty per se is not innovation ; I contend that to fully understand the effects of distance on design innovation , we must consider its impacts on both novelty and quality together ( as our shortlist measure does ) . Further , concerns about risk aversion ( preferring feasibility over novelty ) as an explanation for the negative effects of distance are mitigated when considering that there were estimated positive effects of source diversity , which theoretically also accrues benefits via increasing novelty ( e . g . , through generation of emergent features from the combinations ) . Related to this , there is a potential concern over the binary nature of the creative outcome measure : perhaps both near - and far - inspired ideas get past the binary threshold for being 101 shortlisted , but the absolute quality or ( long - term , eventual ) impact of far - inspired ideas will far exceed that of near - inspired ones . Under this logic , the Conceptual Leap Hypothesis may still be right , if far - inspired ideas produce both worse and better quality ideas , thus sending fewer ideas into the shortlist stage , but the ultimate impact of those that do make it past the threshold ends up dwarfing the impact of any of the other more “mundane” near - inspired ideas . The present data cannot address this caveat : finer - grained expert ratings of the novelty and quality of ideas are needed to address this potential alternative explanation for this dissertation’s findings . These finer - grained ratings will allow us to determine if far - inspired ideas are , on average , of much higher quality or novelty than near - inspired ideas , regardless of the fact that more near - inspired ideas make it past the shortlist threshold . 9 . 3 IMPLICATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS 9 . 3 . 1 Alternate Pathways to Good Ideas These caveats notwithstanding , this dissertation yields some useful insights for the literature . First , my results do stand in opposition to the Conceptual Leap Hypothesis . In tandem with prior opposing findings ( reviewed in the introduction ) , my work lends strength to alternative theories of inspiration by theorists like Perkins ( 1983 ) , who argues that conceptual distance does not matter , and Weisberg ( 2009 ; 2011 ) , who argues that within - domain expertise is a primary driver of innovation . 102 I should be clear that my findings do not imply that no innovative ideas come from far sources ; rather , our data suggest that overreliance on far sources ( e . g . , as indicated by a high mean level of distance ) negatively impacts ideation ( perhaps due to cognitive costs that might not be mitigated by extra processing time ; Perkins 1997 ) . However , my findings do suggest that highly innovative ideas can often come from relying almost not at all on far sources . These good ideas may arise from iterative , deep search , a mechanism for innovative breakthroughs that may be often overlooked but potentially at least as important as singular creative leaps ( Chan & Schunn , 2014 ; Dow , Heddleston , & Klemmer , 2009 ; Mecca & Mumford , 2013 ; Rietzschel , Nijstad , & Stroebe , 2007 ; Sawyer , 2012 ; Weisberg , 2011 ) . In light of this and our findings , it may be fruitful to deemphasize the privileged role of far sources and mental leaps in theories of innovation . It is worth noting that there are potential discrepancies between the way distance is conceptualized and measured in this dissertation , and the notion of “far sources” in the analogy literature , which focus on the joint property of having some base level of structural similarity and low surface similarity . To be most precise , the claims in the theoretical analogy literature about the benefits of far sources ( e . g . , in Gentner & Markman , 1997 ; Ward , 1998 ) are about this particular sort of far sources . However , while I do not explicitly measure structural and surface similarity separately , I argue that my data are not completely disconnected from these theoretical claims , and can in fact inform the assessment of these claims . First , these theories have not clearly specified how to distinguish between structural and surface similarity in complex domains such as design and social innovation : what is “surface” in one mapping ( e . g . , the shape of a logo when mapping the insight of using logos to evoke branding ) may be “structural” in another mapping ( e . g . , transferring the use of a particular shape pattern to evoke a particular 103 message ) . In the absence of clear indications of the nature of each mapping , and clear principles for distinguishing structural from surface similarity across a diversity of source - target mappings , it seems reasonable to use “overall similarity” ( as tracked by LDA ) to measure distance , to allow for the diversity of possible structural mappings . Second , overall similarity of source and target can be a clue to the potential for structural alignment ; indeed , Gentner ( 2010 ) has argued that children use such cues to “bootstrap” their development of relational and analogical reasoning ability . Finally , arguably in most cases in this dataset where inspirations were cited , some mapping was found to the problem , and so there is at least a base level of structural alignment present ( i . e . , it would be difficult to argue that the majority of inspiration citations reflected only superficial feature transfer ) ; given this , it seems reasonable to say that comparisons between inspirations in terms of distance from the problem would largely track surface similarity , thereby aligning the LDA measure of distance more closely to the conceptualization of analogical distance ( i . e . , has structural similarity AND low surface similarity ) than one might initially suppose . For these reasons , I argue that the findings in this dissertation about the negative effects of distance ( and conversely the positive effects of conceptually near sources ) are relevant for revisiting theories of analogical distance and its role in creativity . 9 . 3 . 2 Moderators and Enablers of Conceptual Distance Effects 9 . 3 . 2 . 1 Conceptual Distance of Ideas vs . People Rather than overturning the Conceptual Leap Hypothesis in light of the present data , it may be fruitful to consider how it might be revised / supplemented with specifications of enabling conditions and contextual moderators of the benefits of conceptual distance . One potential 104 enabling condition is suggested by reflections on tensions between the current work and research that has shown the importance of interdisciplinarity for breakthrough innovation . For example , a number of studies have shown boosts in innovation from collaborations between problem solvers from different disciplines and diverse expertises ( Bercovitz & Feldman , 2011 ; Ruef , 2002 ; Singh & Fleming , 2009 ; Taylor & Greve , 2006 ; Uzzi & Spiro , 2005 ) , and some other recent studies have shown that problem solvers from outside the problem domain can often produce the most creative solutions to the problem ( Franke et al . , 2013 ; Jeppesen & Lakhani , 2010 ) . Perhaps there is a critical distinction between conceptual distance of ideas vs . conceptual distance of people . Returning to our reflections on the potential costs of processing far sources , we suggest that expertise in the distant source domain may be a crucial mediator of its benefits . In interdisciplinary collaborations , the expertise of each actor might bypass the cognitive costs of deeply understanding the far domain , and filter out shallow inferences that are not likely to lead to deep insights . Hargadon and Sutton’s ( 1997 ) findings from their in - depth ethnographic study of the consistently innovative IDEO design firm are consistent with an expertise - mediation claim : the firm’s cross - domain - inspired innovations appeared to flow at the day - to - day process level mainly from deep immersion of its designers in multiple disciplines , and “division of expertise” within the firm , with brainstorms acting as crucial catalysts for involving experts from different domains on projects . However , studies directly testing expertise - mediation are scarce or non - existent . Such studies would be highly informative for innovation theory , and also have potential practical implications : if ideas from other domains do in fact have a unique connection to creative breakthroughs , but only when they come from experts in those domains , then resources for finding cross - domain sources may be better routed to finding cross - domain collaborators . 105 9 . 3 . 2 . 2 Problem Variation Another potential moderator is problem characteristics . This study provided partial evidence that there might be problem variation for the distance of indirect sources : however , this variation was correlated with a potential confound of selectivity and / or statistical power . Nevertheless , in light of prior work showing problem variation of stimuli effects in design ideation ( Chiu and Shu , 2012 ; Goldschmidt & Smolkov , 2006 ; Liikkanen & Perttula , 2008 ) , it may be fruitful to further examine problem variation . As mentioned earlier , one potentially important dimension of variation is problem complexity . It could be that as problem domains increase in complexity , specialization might also increase , as the “burden of knowledge” becomes too great for any one person or team to carry ( Jones , 2009 ) . In this situation , good ideas might become “trapped” or “siloed” in different disciplines , making it more important for innovators to draw from outside their discipline in order to create good ideas . Partial support for this conjecture comes from the literature on interdisciplinary team innovation , and from social network theories of innovation that emphasize the privileged position of agents positioned in “structural holes” in the information network ( Burt , 2004 ; Hargadon , 2002 ; Ruef , 2002 ; Tortoriello & Krackhardt , 2010 ) , being able to bridge knowledge and resources from structurally separated regions of the network . Again , however , these theories and findings might only apply to distant people , and not ideas per se , given potential cognitive costs . 9 . 3 . 2 . 3 Source Processing Strategies Finally , it would be interesting to examine potential moderating influences of source processing strategies . In my data , closer sources were more beneficial , but good ideas also did come from far sources ; however , as I have argued , it can be more difficult to convert far sources into viable 106 concepts . Are there common strategies for effective conversion of far sources , and are they different from strategies for effectively building on near sources ? For example , one effective strategy for building on near sources while avoiding fixation is to use a schema - based strategy ( i . e . , extract and transfer abstract functional principles rather than concrete solution features ; Ahmed & Christensen , 2009 ; Yu , Kraut , & Kittur , 2014 ) ; can this strategy also be extended to leverage far sources ? Are there other processing strategies that expert creative designers apply uniquely to far sources ( e . g . , to deal with potentially un - alignable differences ) ? Answering these questions can shed further light on the variety of ways designers can be inspired by sources to produce innovative design ideas . 9 . 3 . 3 Immediate vs . Indirect Effects of Inspiration Sources This dissertation also demonstrated the potential value of distinguishing between immediate and indirect sources . Perhaps owing to the nature of the creative outcome measure ( which combines considerations of both novelty and quality ) , this dissertation suggested that far conceptual combinations may , on average , directly generate ideas that are slightly better than average ( although our statistical confidence in this is very low ) , but that these ideas may then go on to fuel even better ideas . This pattern of results suggests that far conceptual combinations may be good for generating novel , but not necessarily immediately feasible / useful ideas – these ideas may need further processing or refinement before they can be considered “good ideas” and potentially make a meaningful contribution to the problem at hand . It is also worth noting that different results were found for immediate vs . indirect source distance , with indirect source distance appearing to potentially be helpful for some problems , 107 whereas it was consistently harmful when considering immediate sources . These results suggest that further investigations should , if possible , consider the effects of different source characteristics or processing strategies ( or , more generally , ideation strategies / methods ) across the phases of the creative process : for example , far combinations may be especially helpful for expanding the idea space ( divergent processes ) , but less helpful for iterative , deep search , or finding improvements for existing ideas ( convergent processes ) . 9 . 4 SUMMARY OF CONTRIBUTIONS I conclude by reviewing the contributions of this dissertation to the literature . In this dissertation I have : 1 . Developed and validated a computational methodology for studying conceptual distance with complex design concepts . This methodology addresses significant issues of efficiency and scalability faced in prior work : some of the analyses conducted in this dissertation ( e . g . , distance from self , pairwise distances between sources ) would have been costly to the point of intractability without the methodology . 2 . Challenged the widespread but unevenly supported notion that far sources provide the best insights for creative ideation ; instead , I have shown that overreliance on far sources can harm ideation success , and that good ideas can often come from very near sources . Combined with the weight of prior similar findings of neutral or negative effects of distance , and the specific design features of the current study ( namely addressing issues of time scale , statistical power , and problem variation ) , this dissertation helps the 108 literature converge on a more confident conclusion that the Conceptual Leap Hypothesis may need to be overturned , or at least revised / refined . 3 . Discovered the potential value of incorporating a temporal dimension into analyses of the impact of sources of inspiration . I find evidence of differential impacts of source distance and diversity ( viz . , increased problem variation for the effect of source distance , and a more robust positive effect of source diversity ) when considering sources farther back in ideas’ conceptual genealogies . It is my hope that these contributions will inspire further research that continues to enrich and deepen the cognitive science of creativity and innovation . 109 APPENDIX : TOPIC MODELING TECHNICAL DETAILS This appendix presents technical details for my topic model - building approach . Recall that LDA requires that K ( the number of topics ) be prespecified by the modeler . Model fit typically improves with K , with diminishing returns past a certain point . Intuitively , higher K leads to finer - grained topical distinctions , but too high K may lead to uninterpretable topics ; on the other hand , too low K would yield too general topics . Further , traditional methods of optimizing K ( computing “perplexity” , or the likelihood of observing the distribution of words in the corpus given a topic model of the corpus ) do not always correlate with human judgments of model quality ( e . g . , domain expert evaluations of topic quality ; Chang , Gerrish , Wang , Boyd - graber , & Blei , 2009 ) . I explored the following settings of K : [ 12 , 25 , 50 , 100 , 200 , 300 , 400 , 500 , 600 , 700 ] . Because the optimization algorithm for the prior parameters is nondeterministic , models with identical K might produce noticeably different topic model solutions , e . g . , if the optimization search space is rugged , the algorithm might get trapped in different local maxima . Therefore , we ran 50 models at each K , using identical settings ( i . e . , 1000 iterations of the Gibbs sampler , internally optimizing parameters for the asymmetric priors ) . Figure 25 shows the mean fit ( with both continuous and binary similarity judgments ) at each level of K . 110 Figure 25 . Mean fit ( with ±1 SE ) vs human judgments for LDA cosines by level of K . Model fit is generally fairly high at all levels of K , with the continuous judgments tending to increase very slightly with K , tapering out past 400 . Fit with binary judgments tended to decrease ( also very slightly ) with K , probably reflecting the decreasing utility of increasingly finer - grained distinctions for a binary same / different classification . Because I wanted to optimize for fit with human judgments of conceptual distance overall , I selected the level of K at which the divergent lines for fit with continuous and binary judgments first begin to cross ( i . e . , at K = 400 ) . Subsequently , I created a combined “fit” measure ( sum of the correlation coefficients for fit vs . continuous and binary judgments ) , and selected the model with K = 400 that had the best overall fit measure . However , as I reported in section 3 . 2 . 2 . 3 , the main results of this dissertation show robustness to different settings of K . 111 BIBLIOGRAPHY Adamson , R . E . ( 1952 ) .
