The MUC1 gene encodes MUC1 - TM , a signal - transducing trans - membrane protein highly expressed in human malig - nancies . Here we show that an AUG codon downstream to the MUC1 - TM initiation codon initiates an alternate reading frame thereby generating a novel protein , MUC1 - ARF . MUC1 - ARF , like its MUC1 - TM ’parent’ protein , contains a tandem repeat ( VNTR ) domain . How - ever , the amino acid sequence of the MUC1 - ARF tandem repeat as well as N - and C - sequences flanking it differ entirely from those of MUC1 - TM . In vitro protein synthesis assays and extensive immunohistochemical as well as western blot analyses with MUC1 - ARF specific monoclonal antibodies confirmed MUC1 - ARF expression . Rather than being expressed at the cell membrane like MUC1 - TM , immunostaining showed that MUC1 - ARF protein localizes mainly in the nucleus : Immunohistochemical analyses of MUC1 - express - ing tissues demonstrated MUC1 - ARF expression in the nuclei of secretory luminal epithe - lial cells . MUC1 - ARF expression varies in different malignancies . While the malignant epithelial cells of pancreatic cancer show limited expression , in breast cancer tissue MUC1 - ARF demonstrates strong nuclear expression . Proinflammatory cytokines upregu - late expression of MUC1 - ARF protein and co - immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrate association of MUC1 - ARF with SH3 domain - containing proteins . Mass spectrometry per - formed on proteins coprecipitating with MUC1 - ARF demonstrated Glucose - 6 - phosphate 1 - dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) and Dynamin 2 ( DNM2 ) . These studies not only reveal that the MUC1 gene generates a previously unidentified MUC1 - ARF protein , they also show that PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0165031 October 21 , 2016 1 / 34 a11111 OPEN ACCESS Citation : Chalick M , Jacobi O , PichinukE , GarbarC , BensussanA , MeekerA , et al .

Rubinstein ( DBR ) is affiliated with BioModifying LLC , Silver Spring , Maryland , who provided partial supportin just like its ‘parent’ MUC1 - TM protein , MUC1 - ARF is apparently linked to signaling and malignancy , yet a definitive link to these processes and the roles it plays awaits a precise identification of its molecular functions . Comprising at least 524 amino acids , MUC1 - ARF is , furthermore , the longest ARF protein heretofore described . Introduction Any AUG codon within a given mRNA sequence may potentially function as an initiation site for translation , provided that it is located within an appropriate extended nucleotide sequence context that can support translational initiation . Specifically , an in - frame N - terminally extended protein can be generated by translation initiated by an in - frame AUG start codon located 5 ' to a downstream start codon . Accordingly , deep proteome analyses have identified at least sixteen novel AUG start sites that give rise to N - terminally extended protein variants , in addition to four translated upstream ORFs [ 1 ] . Alternatively , start codons appearing at addi - tional sites within the mRNA sequence can initiate mRNA translation in alternate reading frames ( ARFs ) yielding a peptide sequence differing entirely from the ‘parent’ protein product [ 2 ] . In viruses , utilization of alternate reading frames contributes to diversification of the protein repertoire that can be generated from the viral genome , whilst at the same time keeping it com - pact [ 3 ] . In contrast to viruses , in eukaryotic organisms and in humans in particular there have been relatively few definitive reports of translation in alternate reading frames yielding proteins differing from their ' parent ' proteins [ 4 – 7 ] . The best - definedeukaryotic ARF protein studied thus far derives from the INK4 - ARF locus , which generates two alternative transcripts that use different alternate frames of a constitutive exon to encode the tumor suppressor proteins p16 INK4a and p19 ARF [ 8 ] . These proteins inhibit cyclin dependent kinases ( CDK4 and CDK6 ) , thereby preventing phosphorylation and allowing the non - phosphorylated RB proteins to act as suppressors of cell growth [ 9 ] . Interestingly , the corresponding ' parent ' protein p16 INK4A and the alternatively translated p19 ARF both act in shared pathways of tumor suppression . Additional examples of well - definedARF proteins include those derived from the mRNAs coding for the stimulatory G - protein specific to neuroendocrinecells ( termed ALEX ) [ 10 , 11 ] and MASK - BP3 [ 12 ] . Despite their completely different amino acid sequences , functions medi - ated by these pairs of ' parent ' and ARF proteins are intimately intertwined and also involve physical interaction between the ‘parental’ and the ARF proteins . In contrast to the limited number of well - characterized ARF proteins generated from the mammalian genome as describedabove , a recent publication suggests that translation in an alternate reading frame may , to the contrary , be much more prevalent than previously anticipated [ 2 ] . MUC1 , a gene recognizedfor more than two decades , is clearly related to a malignant cell phenotype [ 13 – 15 ] . Its major protein product , the transmembrane MUC1 - TM protein , is highly expressed over the entire cell surface of tumor cells from a variety of epithelial malignan - cies , whereas in normal epithelial cells its expression is not only considerably lower but is also restricted solely to the apical surface of epithelial cells that form luminal structures [ 16 ] . We demonstrate here for the first time that translation in an alternative reading frame of mRNA coding for MUC1 - TM yields a novel protein , here designated MUC1 - ARF . MUC1 - ARF com - prises an amino acid sequence entirely different from that of MUC1 - TM and represents the largest eukaryotic protein derived from translation of an mRNA in an alternate reading frame reported to date . In contrast to localization of MUC1 - TM on the cell surface , MUC1 - ARF MUC1 - ARF—A Novel Nuclear - Resident MUC1 Protein PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0165031 October 21 , 2016 2 / 34 the form of funds for research materials only .

CompetingInterests : The commercial affiliation of DBR does notalter our adherenceto all PLOS ONE policies onsharing data and materials . locates primarily to the cell nucleus . Luminal epithelial cells of tissues such as pancreas and kid - ney , which normally express significant levels of MUC1 - TM also express MUC1 - ARF , while tissues that express low levels of MUC1 - TM such as breast luminal - forming epithelial cells express very low levels of MUC1 - ARF . In contrast , many breast cancers express MUC1 - TM at high levels and of these , a discrete subset shows high MUC1 - ARF expression . We show here that functionally , MUC1 - ARF interacts with signaling proteins , including those comprising SH3 domains and mass spectrometryshowed coprecipitation of MUC1 - ARF with G6PD and Dynamin 2 . While suggestive of a link between MUC1 - ARF , signaling , and malignancy , defini - tive demonstration of such a link awaits identification of MUC1 - ARF’s precise function . In summary , the studies presented here demonstrate that the MUC1 gene generates the novel MUC1 - ARF protein by translation of MUC1 mRNA in an alternate reading frame . Moreover , MUC1 - ARF is , to our knowledge , the longest ARF protein heretofore described . Materials and Methods Cell lines and cell culture DA3 - TM mouse mammary tumor cells transfected with , and expressing cDNA coding for full - length MUC1 - TM [ 17 ] , DA3 - PAR non - transfected parental DA3 cells [ 17 ] , human breast car - cinoma cell lines T47D and ZR75 [ 17 ] , and human pancreatic carcinoma cell line Colo357 [ 17 ] were grown in Dulbecco ' sModified Eagle ' s Medium ( DMEM ) , RPMI and DMEM : F12 ( 1 : 1 ) culture media . Human cell lines were authenticated by Short Tandem Repeat ( STR ) analysis ( PowerPlexW 1 . 2 System , Promega , WI , US ) and the STR profiles were matched to the Ger - man Collectionof Microorganisms and Cell Cultures ( DSMZ ) database . Prior to treatment with cytokine , Colo357 cells were incubated in serum - freemedium for 24 hrs . Cells were then treated at the following concentrations : IL - 1beta ( 20ng / ml ) , IL - 6 ( 40 ng / ml ) , TNF - alpha ( 20 ng / ml ) , or Interferon - gamma ( 10 ng / ml ) . Whole cell lysates Cells were washed with PBS , scraped from culture flasks and pelleted . Two volumes of cold lysis buffer [ 50mM Tris , 100mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 + protease inhibitor cocktail ( Sigma ) ] were added to the cell pellet followed by incubation on ice for 30 minutes and centrifuged for 20 minutes at 12000 RPM . Concentration of protein samples were determined by BCA assay . Nuclear and cytoplasmic lysates Cell pellets were resuspended in extraction buffer [ 0 . 3M sucrose , 50mM Tris pH7 . 4 + protease inhibitor cocktail ( Sigma ) ] and disrupted by 10 freeze and thaw cycles on dry ice . This was fol - lowed by centrifugation 20 minutes at 14000 rpm , and the supernatant collected as the cyto - plasmic protein solution . The pellet was suspended in nuclear extraction buffer ( [ 50mM Tris , 100 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 + protease inhibitor cocktail ( Sigma ) ] and sonicated for 30 seconds with a 1 minute rest 10 times at power setting 5 . This was followed by centrifugation at 14 , 000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4°C , with the supernatant representing the nuclear protein solution . Immunization of mice and generation of hybridomas Mice were immunized with MUC1 - ARF peptide conjugated to KLH . The MUC1 - ARF peptide used for immunization comprised 1 . 3 repeats of the MUC1 - ARF repeat unit , PQPTVSPRPRTPGRPRAPPP - PQPTVS - ( one 20 amino acid long repeat is underlined and six amino acids of the following repeat is double - underlined ) . Use of animals was performed MUC1 - ARF—A Novel Nuclear - Resident MUC1 Protein PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0165031 October 21 , 2016 3 / 34 under the supervision of Tel Aviv University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( TAU - IACUC ) , License number L - 08 - 026 . Animal welfare and steps taken to ameliorate suf - fering including methods of sacrifice were all performed in accordance with regulations stipu - lated by TAU - IACUC . Following immunization , samples of polyclonal sera were taken and antibody titers assessed using an ELISA assay wherein BSA - MUC1 - ARF peptide was coated onto the well surface of 96 well plates . Spleen cells from immunized mice were fused with mouse myeloma NS0 and selected in HAT medium according to the standard protocol . Three - tiered screening for selection of anti - MUC1 - ARF monoclonal antibodies The primary screen of the hybridomas was performed by assessing antibody present in hybrid - oma supernatants binding to MUC1 - ARF peptide . Positive hybridomas were then submitted to a secondary screen wherein hybridoma supernatants were assessed for binding by western blot analysis using lysates from MUC1 transfected cells . Hybridomas that were positive on both the primary and secondaryscreens were finally assessed using immunofluorescence assay on DA3 mouse cells that do not express human MUC1 ( as negative control ) , and on stable DA3 transfectants expressing human MUC1 . Hybridomas secreting antibody that scored posi - tive in all three screens were subsequently cloned by repeated limiting dilution until a stable clone was obtained . Immunofluorescence— Cells ( 50 , 000 cells per well ) were seeded on glass cover - slips in 24 - well culture plates . The next day , cells were rinsed with ice - cold PBS and fixed with 100 % methanol for 5 min at - 20°C followed by permeabilization with methanol / acetone ( 1 : 1 ) . The cells were subjected to immunofluorescence staining with primary antibody for 1h at room temperature , then washed and incubated with fluorescently - labeledsecondary antibody at room temperature for an additional 1 h . The cells were examined by fluorescence confocal microscopy . Immunohistochemistry Tissue microarrays were purchased from US Biomax , Inc . URL - http : / / biomax . us . Tissue sec - tions ( paraffin embedded , 5 microns in thickness ) were deparaffinizedfollowed by rehydration . Automated Immunological stains were performed with the Dako Autostainer Link 48 ( Dako ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Antigen retrieval was done using citrate buffer for 30 minutes at room temperature , or at alkaline pH ( Tris - EDTA , pH9 . 0 ) for the anti - MUC1 - ARF antibodies . Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with EnVision Flex Per - oxidase Blocking Reagent ( Dako ) for 30 minutes , followed by incubation with primary anti - body ( 5microgram / ml ) for 120 minutes . The immunological reaction was revealed by means of polymer dextran coupled with peroxidase molecule and secondaryantibodies for 15 minutes ( EnVision - Flex / HRP , Dako ) and diaminobenzidinefor 10 minutes ( DakoCytomation ) . Coun - terstain was carried out with hematoxylin for 10 minutes . Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analyses Cell lysates prepared from MCF7 breast cancer cells that endogenously express MUC1 - ARF were subjected to immunoprecipitation using ProteinA / ProteinG agarose beads ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , catalog number sc - 2002 ) to which the monoclonal antibody MPR2G10 had been prebound . Following extensive washing of the beads , bound proteins underwent trypsin digestion . Liquid chromatography – tandem mass spectrometry ( LC – MS / MS ) was performed using a 15 cm reversed - phase fused - silicacapillary column ( inner diameter , 75 um ) made in - house and packed with 3 um ReproSil - Pur C18AQ media ( Dr . Maisch HPLC GmbH ) .

Peptides were separated with a four hour gradient from 5 to 65 % acetoni - trile ( buffer A , 5 % acetonitrile , 0 . 1 % formic acid and 0 . 005 % TFA ; buffer B , 90 % acetonitrile , 0 . 2 % formic acid and 0 . 005 % TFA ) . The voltage applied to the union to produce an electrospray was 1 . 2 kV . The mass spectrometer was operated in the data - dependent mode . Survey mass spectrometryscans were acquired in the Orbitrap with the resolution set to a value of 60 , 000 . The seven most intense ions per scan were fragmented and analyzed in the linear ion trap . Raw data files were searched with MASCOT ( Matrix Science ) against a Swissprot database . Search parameters included a fixed modification of 57 . 02146 Da ( carboxyamidomethylation ) on Cys , and variable modifications 15 . 99491 Da ( oxidation ) on Met , and 0 . 984016 Da ( deamidation ) on Asn and Gln . The search parameters also included : maximum 2 missed cleavages , initial precursor ion mass tolerance 10 ppm , fragment ion mass tolerance 0 . 6 Da . Samples were fur - ther analyzed in Scaffold ( Proteome software ) . Flow cytometry After trypsinization , cells were washed , and mouse 2G10 antibody , with or without competitor peptide was added for 1 hour at 4°C . Following washing with flow cytometry ( FACS ) buffer , fluorescein labeled goat anti - mouse IgG antibody was added for 45 minutes at 4°C . Detection of bound IgG was by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur™ ( Becton Dickinson ) . Sandwich ELISA for determining MUC1 - ARF / MUC1 - TM levels Elisa Immunoassay plates ( CoStar ) were coated with either MPR - 2G10 mAb or with H23 mAb for detection of MUC1 - ARF or MUC1 - TM respectively , followed by blocking . Cell lysates at 1mg / ml protein concentration were then applied to the wells followed by adding anti - MUC1 - ARF monoclonal antibody MPR - 4B3 , or anti - MUC1 - TM monoclonal antibody H23 , both conjugated to biotin . Detection of MUC1 - ARF binding was performed by horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) - conjugated to streptavidin . The results were calculated as an average of 3 experiments , performed in triplicates . In vitro transcription and translation In vitro transcription and translation reactions were performed as previously described [ 18 ] and in vitro translation products were analyzed on standard SDS - polyacrylamidegels . Results Translation of MUC1 - TM mRNA results in synthesis of both MUC1 - TM ‘parent’ protein and an alternately - read MUC1 - ARF protein Translation of mRNA transcribedfrom MUC1 cDNA comprising one 60 nucleotide repeat unit revealed the expected MUC1 - TM protein products , namely uncleaved MUC1 alpha - beta indicated by unfilledarrow - head , the MUC1 - TM alpha - subunit indicated by [ alpha , black dia - mond ] , and the C - terminal MUC1 - TM beta - subunit indicated by [ beta , unfilledarrow ] ( Fig 1A , lanes 1 – 3 , and Fig 1B , lanes 1 and 2 ) . The MUC1 mRNA used here for the in vitro transla - tion assays contained only a single 60 nucleotide repeat unit , as compared to the 15 – 125 tan - dem repeat units present in naturally occurringMUC1 mRNA , thus explaining the relatively low molecular masses observedin the in - vitro translation assays both for the MUC1 alpha - beta parental protein and the MUC1 - TM alpha - subunit . That the band labeled by [ alpha , black dia - mond ] is in fact the N - terminal MUC1 - TM alpha - subunit has been previously unequivocally MUC1 - ARF—A Novel Nuclear - Resident MUC1 Protein PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0165031 October 21 , 2016 5 / 34 Fig 1 . In vitro translation of MUC1 mRNA yields both MUC1 - TM protein and MUC1 - ARF protein .

( C ) MUC1 mRNA containinga single 20 amino acid repeat was translated for 30 minutes in an in vitro reticulocyte protein translation system with [ 35 S ] - methionine and [ 35 S ] - cysteine and labelledproteins chased with an excess of unlabeledmethionineand cysteine .

Specifically , ( i ) it is not radioactively labeled when cysteine is used as the sole radioactive amino acid in the in - vitro translation reaction [ see Fig 1 in [ 18 ] ] , in accord with the absence of cysteine residues in the MUC1 - TM alpha - subunit and ( ii ) as expected for the MUC1 - TM alpha - subunit formed by the ongoing cleavage within the MUC1 SEA module , in a pulse chase experiment the intensity of the [ alpha , black diamond ] band increases with the efflux of time [ Fig 1C , and see Fig 1 in [ 18 ] ] . The band migrating with a molecular mass of about 20kDa and here indicated by [ beta , unfilled arrow ] ( Fig 1A , lanes 1 and 2 , and Fig 1B , lanes 1 and 2 ) has been previously unambiguously identified as the MUC1 - TM beta - subunit [ 18 ] and reconfirmed here , because ( i ) the 20kDa band is absent following translation of a MUC1 mRNA truncated at both the Pst1 and Acc1 sites that are located upstream to the N - ter - minus of the region coding for the MUC1 - TM beta - subunit [ compare Fig 1A , lanes 4 and 5 with Fig 1A lane 1 , and see Fig 1 in [ 18 ] ] , and ( ii ) during the chase period of a pulse - chase experiment the levels of this protein also increase with time as does the MUC1 - TM alpha - sub - unit [ see Fig 1 in [ 18 ] ] . Note that translation of MUC1 mRNA truncated at the PvuII site ( see Fig 1D for the location of the PvuII site within the region coding for the cytoplasmic domain of the MUC1 - TM beta - subunit ) leads to a faster migrating band representing the curtailed MUC1 - TM beta - subunit ( Fig 1A , compare lane 2 with lane 1 ) , whereas no alternative fragment was observedfollowing translation of MUC1 mRNA truncated at the BalI site ( Fig 1A , lane 3 ) . This is because the fragment of the MUC1 - TM beta - subunit derived from translation of MUC1 mRNA truncated at the BalI site is much shortened and therefore likely comigrates with the globin present in great amounts in the reticulocytelysate . In order to allow for better resolution of the MUC1 alpha - beta parental protein , the MUC1 - TM alpha - subunit and the MUC1 - ARF protein ( see below ) , electrophoresis in Fig 1C was performed for an extended period of time leading to elution from the gel of the small MUC1 - TM beta - subunit . Unexpectedly , following in - vitro translation of MUC1 mRNA an additional prominently labeled band designated MUC1 - ARF ( indicated by [ red arrow - head ] , Fig 1A , lanes 1 – 3 , Fig 1B and 1C ) was observed . It migrated with a molecular mass in the region of 30kDa , and as describedabove ( and see below for a more detailed analysis ) , it represents neither the MUC1 - TM alpha - subunit nor the MUC1 - TM beta - subunit . The fact that in - vitro translation of MUC1 mRNA truncated at sites upstream to the C - terminal end of the MUC1 - TM alpha - subunit [ for location of restriction sites see Fig 1D and 1E , AccI ( A ) and PstI ( Ps ) , ] leads to syn - thesis of truncated forms of the MUC1 - ARF protein ( Fig 1A , lanes 4 and 5 , indicated by red arrow heads ) ) clearly indicates two points : ( i ) MUC1 - ARF cannot possibly represent the MUC1 - TM beta - subunit , because the MUC1 mRNAs truncated either at the AccI or at the Pst1 sites do not comprise information coding for MUC1 - TM beta - subunit , and ( ii ) MUC1 - ARF must be coded for by the MUC1 mRNA . Comparison of the two protein products , MUC1 - ARF and the MUC1 - TM alpha - subunit ( compare ARF protein [ red arrow - head ] with that of the MUC1 - TM alpha - subunit designated by [ black diamond ] , Fig 1A , 1B and 1C ) , shows that in vitro synthesis results in MUC1 - ARF protein levels that are only slightly less than those of the MUC1 - TM alpha - subunit , indicating that translation of MUC1 mRNA yields significant amounts of MUC1 - ARF protein . Translation of mRNAs generated from MUC1 cDNAs digested by restriction enzymes cleaving at sites upstream to the C - terminal end of the MUC1 - TM alpha - subunit [ Fig 1D and 1E , AccI ( A ) and PstI ( Ps ) ] lead as expected to synthesis of C - terminally truncated MUC1 - TM alpha - subunits ( Fig 1A , bands designated by [ black dia - mond ] ; compare lanes 4 and 5 with lanes 1 , 2 and 3 ) . Translation of the same truncated MUC1 mRNAs yielded MUC1 - ARF proteins that are similarly diminished in size ( Fig 1A , bands des - ignated by [ red arrow - head ] ; compare lanes 4 and 5 with lanes 1 , 2 and 3 ) confirming that MUC1 - ARF proteins do in fact derive from translation of MUC1 mRNA , as describedabove . As expected , translation of mRNAs generated from MUC1 cDNAs digested by PvuII ( Pv ) and MUC1 - ARF—A Novel Nuclear - Resident MUC1 Protein PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0165031 October 21 , 2016 7 / 34 BalI ( B ) that cut sites located upstream to the stop codon of full - length MUC1 yet downstream to the C - terminal end of the MUC1 - TM alpha - subunit ( see Fig 1D and 1E , for restriction sites ) , lead to the generation of truncated uncleaved MUC1 alpha - beta ( Fig 1A , lanes 2 and 3 , indicated by [ unfilledarrowhead ] ) , and intact MUC1 - TM alpha - subunit and MUC1 - ARF pro - tein ( Fig 1A , lanes 2 and 3 , indicated by [ black diamond ] and [ red arrow - head ] , respectively ) . These results support the following conclusions : [ 1 ] The comparable decrease in molecular mass of the MUC1 - TM alpha - subunit protein and of the MUC1 - ARF protein arising from 3 ' truncation in the MUC1 - TM mRNAs ( Fig 1A , bands designated by [ black diamond ] and [ red arrow - head ] , compare lanes 4 and 5 with lanes 1 , 2 and 3 ) indicates that both proteins are translated from the same mRNA and terminate in proximity to each other . [ 2 ] Because the MUC1 - TM mRNA in these experiments contained only a single tandem repeat sequence , the MUC1 - ARF protein cannot represent polymorphic MUC - TM proteins varying in the numbers of tandem repeats , but in fact represents a distinct MUC1 protein entity . [ 3 ] The size difference between the MUC1 - TM alpha - subunit proteins and the MUC1 - ARF proteins ( Fig 1A , 1B and 1C bands designated by [ black diamond ] , and [ red arrow - head ] respectively ) suggest that the two proteins are different . Translation of two naturally occurringisoforms of MUC1 - TM mRNA ( ‘a’ and ‘b’ in Fig 1 , panel D ) , yields uncleaved full - length MUC1 - TM protein and N - cleavage proteins that differ by about 1000 Daltons [ alpha - beta ( unfilled arrow - head ) and alpha ( black diamond ) , respec - tively Fig 1B , lanes 1 and 2 ) . This is because variant ‘a’ differs from variant ' b ' in that it com - prises an additional 27 nucleotides coding for nine amino acids downstream to the AUG initiation codon of MUC1 - TM . In contrast , because the two differently sized MUC1 - TM mRNAs , ' a ' and ' b ' , yield identically sized MUC1 - ARF proteins [ Fig 1B , lanes 1 and 2 , compare MUC1 - ARF proteins indicated by ( red arrow - head ) ] , we conclude that the initiation codon directing MUC1 - ARF synthesis is located downstream to that initiating the MUC1 - TM pro - tein . Finally , because of the autoproteolytic cleavage of the precursor MUC1 - TM protein within its SEA module into cleaved alpha - and beta - subunits , a pulse - chase experiment dem - onstrated a time - dependent decrease in levels of the full - length MUC1 - TM protein ( alpha - beta and designated by open arrow - head , Fig 1C , lanes 1 – 3 ) , accompanied by an associated increase in MUC1 - TM alpha - subunit ( designated by alpha , black diamond , Fig 1C , lanes 1 – 3 ) . In con - trast , MUC1 - ARF levels remained constant throughout the chase ( indicated by ARF , red arrow - head , Fig 1C , lanes 1 – 3 ) , demonstrating that MUC1 - ARF clearly does not contain a cleavable SEA module and must represent a protein distinct from MUC1 - TM . Analysis of the MUC1 mRNA reveals an AUG codon located 265 nucleotides downstream to the MUC1 - TM initiation codon that ( i ) initiates a long + 1 frameshifted open reading frame , ( ii ) contains an upstream Kozak consensus sequences ( ccaccacc / t ) , and ( iii ) has the potential to initiate translation of a frameshifted alternate reading frame ( ARF ) protein ( Fig 2 ) . As shown above , in vitro translation of MUC1 mRNA yields proteins consistent with translation of the MUC1 - TM mRNA in an alternative reading frame directed by an initiation codon downstream to that initiating MUC1 - TM synthesis . Like MUC1 - TM , MUC1 - ARF harbors a tandem repeat ( VNTR ) domain , but because of the + 1 frameshift , the amino acid sequence of both the MUC1 - ARF tandem repeat as well as the N - and C - sequences flanking it differ entirely from those of the MUC1 - TM protein ( Fig 1F ) . Because MUC1 mRNA comprising only one tandem repeat was used for the in vitro translation assays describedabove , the MUC1 - ARF protein product ( with one 20 amino acid repeat sequence ) is predicted to contain 245 amino acids and the molecular mass for MUC1 - ARF observedhere ( in the region of 30kDa ) corresponds well with that expected for the in - vitro translated MUC1 - ARF protein . Remarkably , the alternate reading frame codes for 49 amino acids upstream to the VNTR and 175 amino acids downstream to the VNTR .

As previously reported [ 16 , 20 – 22 ] , cells transfected with human MUC1 DNA express high levels of the human MUC - TM protein as assessed with anti - MUC1 - TM tandem repeat mAbs that localized exclusively to the cell membrane and cyto - plasm ( Fig 3C , right - hand panel ) . Reacting the same cells in parallel with anti - ARF - repeat mAb MPR2G10 demonstrated predominantly nuclear localization ( Fig 3C , left - hand panel ) , consistent with the pattern shown above . A sandwich ELISA assay consisting of capture mAb MPR2G10 and detecting biotinylated mAb MPR4B3 could readily detect the MUC1 - ARF protein ( see below section " Endogenous MUC1 - ARF protein is detected in human cancer cell lines " ) , and although the anti - MUC1 - ARF mAbs recognize discrete epitopes in the MUC1 - ARF repeat sequence , they all bind to the MUC1 - ARF protein . Immunoreactivity of anti - MUC1 - ARF mAb MPR2G10 with DA3 cells transfected with both human MUC1 cDNA and human genomic MUC1 DNA was the most robust ( Fig 4 , panels A and B ) . It was therefore chosen for subsequent studies . Probing immunoblots of lysates from cells transfected with human MUC1 DNA demonstrated MUC1 - ARF that migrated with a molecular mass of about 80kDa ( Fig 4E , lane DA3 - G ) . MUC1 - ARF protein was seen neither in non - transfected cells ( Fig 4E , lane DA3 - P ) , nor following addition of competing ARF peptide . Two distinct murine 3T3 transfectants , each receiving human MUC1 cDNA comprising a different number of tandem repeats provided further confirmation of MUC1 - ARF expression in MUC1 - transfected cells . Variation in the number of tandem repeats provides an inherent size - signature ‘barcode’ to MUC1 proteins translated by each of the two transfectants . Accord - ingly , when western blots were probed with anti - [ MUC1 - TM tandem repeat ] antibodies , each of the two stable 3T3 transfectants showed differently sized high molecular mass MUC1 - TM proteins ( Fig 4F3 , filled green arrows ) , reflecting the size of the tandem repeat domain con - tained within each of the MUC1 cDNAs used for transfection . MUC1 - TM glycoprotein is heavily post - translationally modifiedby both N - and O - linked glycosylations [ 14 , 23 , 24 ] . Probing similar blots with anti - MUC1 - ARF revealed that the two transfectants produced dis - tinctly sized MUC1 - ARF proteins ( Fig 4F1 , filled red arrowheads ) . Cells transfected with MUC1 - I or MUC1 - II cDNA expressed MUC1 - ARF proteins of approximately 60kDa and 90kDa respectively , corresponding to the tandem repeat polymorphisms of the transfected MUC1 DNAs . The calculated mass of the MUC1 - ARF protein with a single repeat unit is 27 , 253 Daltons . Each additional MUC1 - ARF repeat unit adds on an additional calculated mass of 2 , 161 . 5 Daltons . We therefore estimate that the MUC1 - I and MUC1 - II cDNAs comprise about 17 and 28 MUC1 - ARF repeat units , respectively . Addition of competing MUC1 - ARF peptide ablated immunoreactivity , confirming the specificity of the anti - MUC1 - ARF antibod - ies ( Fig 4F2 , lanes 2 and 3 ) as does the absence of reactivity in lysates from non - transfected cells ( Fig 4F1 , lane 1 , designated PAR ) . Since the molecular mass of MUC1 - ARF protein correlates with the number of tandem repeat sequences contained within the MUC1 gene , which varies between different individuals and cell lines , the size of MUC1 - ARF proteins will correspondingly vary . This means that dif - ferently sized MUC1 - ARF proteins will be detected in different cell lines . To see whether MUC1 - ARF has the potential to be post - translationally modified , the MUC1 - ARF amino acid sequence was interrogated using the MotifScan analysis ( http : / / scansit . mit . edu ) . In order to improve our level of confidence in the analysis , the scan was per - formed only at the highest level of stringency and we purposely did not opt for the medium and low stringency levels of scanning . This MotifScan analysis predicted , with very high levels of confidence , multiple sites for post - translational modifications within the MUC1 - ARF protein . Sites for phosphorylation on serine or / and threonine ( S / T ) residues mediated by calmodulin dependent kinase 2 ( CAMGK2G ) were predicted in the following sequences : RQP T MSP located just upstream to the tandem repeats , RPR T PGR and PTV S PRP both sites located MUC1 - ARF—A Novel Nuclear - Resident MUC1 Protein PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0165031 October 21 , 2016 11 / 34 Fig 4 .

The molecular masses of the two MUC1 - ARF proteins ( Fig 4F1 , lanes 2 and 3 ) are consider - ably less than those of the corresponding MUC1 - TM proteins ( Fig 4F3 , filled green arrows ) , suggesting that although the MUC1 - ARF proteins are likely post - translationally modified , as describedabove , these are not as extensive as those of MUC1 - TM . Endogenous MUC1 - ARF protein is detected in human cancer cell lines We extended our analyses to human cancer cells which natively express high levels of the MUC1 - TM protein . Immunofluorescent analyses done with anti - MUC1 - ARF mAb 2G10 showed expression of endogenous MUC1 - ARF protein that localized primarily to the cell nucleus . This was seen in T47D breast cancer cells ( Fig 5 , panels A and C ) , COLO357 pancre - atic cancer cells ( Fig 5 , panels B ) and ZR75 breast cancer cells ( Fig 5 , panels E and F ) . The prominent nuclear staining seen in T47D breast cancer cells with the anti - MUC1ARF mAb 2G10 was abrogated by addition of competing MUC1 - ARF peptide ( compare Fig 5 , panels C and D ) , showing antibody specificity . Simultaneous costaining of breast cancer ZR75 cells ( Fig 5 , panels E ) with anti - MUC1 - TM mAbs [ DMB5F3 [ 17 ] , directly labeled with a green fluorescent dye ] together with anti - MUC1 - ARF mAb 2G10 ( labeled red ) , clearly showed that the two MUC1 proteins did not colocalize : MUC1 - TM localized at the cell membrane as expected , whereas MUC1 - ARF protein was predominantly nuclear ( Fig 5 , see panels Ei , Eii and Eiii ) . Furthermore addition of competing MUC1 - TM - junction protein abrogated the cell membrane signal of MUC1 - TM , and was of no effect on the nuclear MUC1 - ARF ( Fig 5 , com - pare panels E and panels F ) . Probing blots with anti - MUC1 - ARF antibody 2G10 further demonstrated that endogenous MUC1 - ARF protein migrated with a molecular mass of slightly more than 55kDa ( Fig 5G , left lane ) , and that its reactivity was abolished by MUC1 - ARF peptide ( Fig 5G , open red arrow , right lane ) . The molecular mass of the protein seen in Colo357 cells corresponds to a MUC1 - ARF protein containing about 14 MUC1 - ARF repeat units . Human cancer cell lines A431 , MCF7 and KB known to express MUC1 - TM protein were assessed for MUC1 - ARF expression by western blot analyses . Results indicate that cells which express MUC1 mRNA also expressed MUC1 - ARF proteins with molecular masses ranging from about 48kDa to 55kDa ( Fig 6 , panels A , B and C , MUC1 - ARF protein indicated by lower red arrowhead ) . These correspond to MUC1 - ARF proteins containing about 11 to 17 MUC1 - ARF tandem repeat units expressed by the relatively smaller MUC1 allele present in the these cell lines . A larger MUC1 - ARF protein , expressed from the larger MUC1 allele detected in MCF7 cells migrated with a molecular mass of about 130kDa , corresponding to a MUC1 - ARF protein containing about 47 ARF tandem repeat units ( Fig 6B , upper red arrow - head ) . Its intensity was significantly less as compared to that of the small allele gene product ( Fig 6B , lane 1 , compare upper and lower red arrowheads ) , consistent with the previously reported reduced expression of the larger MUC1 alleles gene products [ 25 ] . In fact in the absence of added cytokines , only the smaller MUC1 - ARF allele could be detected in KB cells ( Fig 6C , lane 1 red arrowhead ) . However , addition of IL1 - beta and interferon - gamma to KB cells , a combination known to increase MUC1 gene expression [ 26 ] , led to the appearance of the larger MUC1 - ARF protein ( Fig 6C lane 2 , indicated by upper red arrowhead with a mass of about 120kDa ) corresponding to the larger MUC1 allele present in these cells . The size differ - ence of the two MUC1 - ARF proteins observedin KB cells tallies remarkably well with that published for the two MUC1 alleles of KB cells as determined by Northern blotting analyses [ 26 ] .

No MUC1 - ARF protein was detected in the neuroblastoma cell line SY5Y consistent with the undetectable expression of the MUC1 gene in these cells ( Fig 6D and 6F ) . An additional two cell lines , HK293 and U87 , which do not express the MUC1 gene , also did not express the MUC1 - ARF protein ( Fig 6E ) . Quantitative PCR analyses ( qPCR ) to assess expression of MUC1 mRNA validated that only those cells ( A431 , MCF7 and Colo357 ) that express MUC1 mRNA also displayed MUC1 - ARF protein , whereas those cells that had low to undetectable levels of MUC1 expres - sion ( HK293 , U87 and SY5Y ) were likewise negative for MUC1 - ARF protein ( Fig 6A – 6F ) .

Quantitation of MUC1 - ARF protein in nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments demon - strated MUC1 - ARF protein in nuclear extracts prepared from human T47D breast cancer cells while cytoplasmic extracts displayed much lower levels ( Fig 5H , left panel ) . Analysis of MUC1 - TM revealed an inverse picture : while high levels were observedin cytoplasmic extracts , nuclear MUC1 - TM was almost undetectable ( Fig 5H , right panel ) . Within the nucleus itself MUC1 - ARF staining revealed a non - homogeneous distribution , with intense MUC1 - ARF immunostaining observedin discrete subnuclear aggregates ( red staining , Fig 5A , 5B , 5C - i , 5E - i and 5F - i ) . Additional analyses by confocal laser microscopy and orthogonal projections ( Fig 5I , 5i , 5ii and 5iii ) showed intense staining with both DAPI and with anti - MUC1 - ARF antibod - ies , suggesting that MUC1 - ARF localizes to subnuclear regions comprising condensed chroma - tin . This colocalization was further confirmed by etoposide treatment of MUC1 cDNA - transfected cells which induced large DAPI - positive condensed chromatin aggregates to which MUC1 - ARF clearly colocalized ( Fig 5J , compare panels i and ii ) . In contrast , immunostaining of non - transfected cells was negative ( Fig 5J , DA3 - PAR ) . Expression of MUC1 - ARF in normal human tissues correlates with MUC1 - TM expression MUC1 - TM is detected on the apical surface of normal epithelial cells that form luminal struc - tures ( for example , [ 27 ] ) . To see whether MUC1 - ARF protein is co - expressed with MUC1 - TM in these cells , sequential serial sections of human tissues were reacted with monoclonal antibod - ies specific for either MUC1 - TM or MUC1 - ARF . To detect MUC1 - TM we used the previously characterized mAb DMB5F3 [ 17 ] which binds specificallyto the MUC1 - TM SEA module with picomolar affinity . For MUC1 - ARF detection , use was made of the mAb MPR2G10 , here shown to bind the MUC1 - ARF tandem repeat sequence ( see Fig 1D and 1E for regions of MUC1 - TM and MUC1 - ARF recognizedby the antibodies ) . In kidney tissue , MUC1 - ARF expression was seen only in those cells that also expressed MUC1 - TM [ Fig 7 , compare Panels A - i ( MUC1 - TM ) with A - ii ( MUC1 - ARF ) ] . Larger fields and higher magnifications are shown in Fig 7 ; Panels C - i and C - i’ ( MUC1 - TM ) and Panels D - i and D - i’ ( MUC1 - ARF ) ] . Similar results were seen with pancreatic sections ( Fig 7 , Panels B - i ( MUC1 - TM ) with B - ii ( MUC1 - ARF ) ] . For larger fields and at higher magnifications see Fig 7 , Panels E - i and E - i’ ( MUC1 - TM ) and Panels E - ii and E - ii’ ( MUC1 - ARF ) . In contrast to MUC1 - TM localization on the apical surfaces of normal luminal - forming epithelial cells , MUC1 - ARF localizedprimarily to the nuclei of these same cells both in kidney and in pancreas . Addition of ARF peptide abro - gated reactivity only of anti - MUC1 - ARF antibody ( Fig 7 , compare Panel B - ii with B - ii " ) , whereas recombinant MUC1 - SEA - module protein abrogated reactivity only of anti - MUC1 - SEA antibody ( Fig 7 , compare Panels B - i with B - i " ) , confirming specificity of each antibody with its target protein . Kidney tissue sections were particularly informative in that only luminal - forming cells of distal tubules ( DT ) stained positive for the MUC1 - TM protein ( Fig 7 , Panels A - i , C - i and C - i ' ) whereas cells of proximal tubules ( PT ) , glomeruli ( G ) , and Bowman’s capsule were uniformly negative . Correspondingly MUC1 - ARF is expressed only in cells forming the lumen of distal tubules where it localized to cell nuclei , directly correlating with MUC1 - TM expression ( com - pare MUC1 - ARF expression in Fig 7 , Panels A - ii , D - i and D - i ' with MUC1 - TM expression in Fig 7 , Panels A - i , C - i and C - i ' ) .

Expression of both MUC1 - ARF and MUC1 - TM expression is restricted to the exocrine pancreas and neither are expressed in the endocrine pancreas Whereas MUC1 - TM protein was readily observedat the apical surfaces of pancreatic ducts of the exocrine pancreas ( Fig 8B and 8B ' ) , no immunoreactivity for MUC1 - TM was observedin the pancreatic islets forming the ' endocrine pancreas ' ( Fig 8B and 8B ' - note the absence of MUC1 - TM immunoreactivity in the Islets of Langerhans , demarcated by the blue dotted lines ) . This is in accord with the known expression of MUC1 - TM solely within the exocrine pancreas , in cells lining the intercalated , intralobular and interlobular ducts . Cells of neuroen - docrine origin forming the Islets of Langerhans are known not to express MUC1 [ 28 – 30 ] . MUC1 - ARF protein was also exclusively expressed in cells of the exocrine pancreas where it localized primarily to cell nuclei ( Fig 8A and 8A ' ) . In contrast , and again in accord with MUC1 - TM expression , all cells of the endocrine pancreas were uniformly negative for MUC1 - ARF ( Fig 8A and 8A ' ) . These results demonstrate that ( a ) in the pancreas only those cells that express the MUC1 - TM protein isoform also express MUC1 - ARF , just as observedfor kidney tissue , and ( b ) the nuclear staining for MUC1 - ARF is specific because nuclei of cells comprising the Islets of Langerhans were uniformly negative for MUC1 - ARF staining , whereas cells of the exocrine pancreas contained within the same section were MUC1 - ARF positive . Taken together , these studies show a tight correlation in normal tissues between MUC1 - ARF expression and that of MUC1 - TM . Certain cell types both in the kidney and pancreas that express MUC1 - TM also express MUC1 - ARF , whereas those kidney and pancreatic cells that do not express MUC1 - TM , also do not express MUC1 - ARF ( Figs 7 and 8 ) . Furthermore , nor - mal tissues such as brain and liver that have no MUC1 - TM expression are also devoid of MUC1 - ARF protein . MUC1 - ARF expression in normal and malignant pancreatic and breast tissues The patterns of MUC1 - TM and MUC1 - ARF expression in normal and malignant pancreatic and breast tissues displayed significant differences . High MUC1 - TM expression was observed in pancreatic cancer tissues , accompanied by a loss of MUC1 - ARF expression [ compare expression of MUC1 - TM and MUC1 - ARF in normal pancreatic tissue ( Fig 9C , left and right panels respectively ) , to that seen in pancreatic cancer tissue ( Fig 9D , left and right panels respectively ) ] . In contrast to normal pancreatic tissues , both MUC1 - TM and MUC1 - ARF are expressed at very low levels in resting normal breast tissue . In breast cancer cells we found sub - stantial MUC1 - TM expression ( Fig 9A , examples of expression in 3 breast cancer samples , left - hand panels ) , consistent with elevated MUC1 - TM expression in breast tumors as described in the literature [ 14 , 31 ] . Our analyses of a series of breast tumor tissues demonstrated that approximately 40 % of the MUC1 - TM positive sections ( totaling 96 different samples ) were MUC1 - ARF positive . MUC1 - ARF expressers ( for examples see Fig 9A , middle panels , labeled anti - MUC1 - ARF ) could be roughly divided into three groups differing from each other in their patterns of MUC1 - ARF expression : [ i ] high expression of both MUC1 - TM and nuclear MUC1 - ARF , [ ii ] high MUC1 - TM expression and no MUC1 - ARF expression , [ iii ] high MUC1 - TM expression and focal MUC1 - ARF expression in only a subset of cells . The signifi - cance of this MUC1 - ARF expression in only some of the breast cancer samples is further con - sidered in the Discussion section .

Although interferon - gamma by itself was shown to upregulate MUC1 expression in most cell lines , the addition of tumor necrosis factor - alpha to interferon - gamma elicited marked synergistic stimulation of MUC1 expression [ 26 , 33 ] . Specifically , com - binations of the cytokines [ interferon - gamma and IL - 1beta ] , [ IL - 6 together with TNFalpha ] and [ interferon - gamma and TNFalpha ] have been shown to stimulate MUC1 - TM expression to several - fold higher than by each cytokine alone [ 26 ] . We therefore looked at the effect of these combinations of cytokines on MUC1 - ARF expression . Similarly to cytokine stimulation of MUC1 - TM expression , MUC1 - ARF showed both quantitative and qualitative changes Fig 8 .

Immunofluorescence with mAb MPR2G10 , combina - tions of interferon - gamma and IL - 1beta , IL - 6 together with TNFalpha , and of interferon - gamma and TNFalpha clearly led to increased MUC1 - ARF expression ( Fig 10A , compare Pan - els ‘b’ , ' c ' and ' d ' , with Panel ' a ' ) . Flow cytometryanalyses and quantitative ELISA assays using anti - MUC1 - ARF monoclonal antibody MPR2G10 confirmed these findings ( Fig 10B , Panels ' a ' , ' b ' and ' c ' ) . As expected , prolonged cytokine treatment with interferon - gamma and IL - 1beta clearly induced MUC1 - TM . Irrespective of cytokine addition , MUC1 - TM remained tethered at the cell membrane ( Fig 10C , compare panels a and b ) . In contrast , prolonged cytokine treatment elicited a disproportionate increase in cytoplasmic MUC1 - ARF at the expense of nuclear Fig 9 .

This shift was particularly prominent following extended cytokine treatment , and discrete compartments that stained intensely for MUC1 - ARF appeared to be in the process of forming blebs at the cell surface ( Fig 10D , indicated by yellow arrows ) . MUC1 - ARF function : The proline - rich tandem repeat domain of MUC1 - ARF interacts with SH3 - domain containing signaling proteins In an attempt to define MUC1 - ARF function , we used a bioinformatic MotifScan approach to search for proteins putatively interacting with MUC1 - ARF . This yielded a set of signaling pro - teins such as Grb2 , phospholipase C - gamma1 , p85 subunit of PI - 3 ' - kinase , and Abl tyrosine kinase which were predicted to bind via their SH3 domains with a high level of confidence ( > 99 . 9 th percentile ) to proline - rich regions of MUC1 - ARF tandem repeat sequence GRPRAPP P PQPTVSP . To see whether MUC1 - ARF in fact forms complexes with SH3 - con - taining proteins as predicted , anti - MUC1 - ARF immunoprecipitates ( IP ) were resolved by SDS - PAGE and probed by immunoblotting ( IB ) with an array of antibodies recognizing SH3 – domain containing proteins . These assays demonstrated that in fact Abl tyrosine kinase and cortactin , both of which contain SH3 domains co - precipitated with MUC1 - ARF from MUC1 cDNA transfected HK cells ( Fig 10E , lanes 2 , panels ' a ' and ' b ' ) . HK cells transfected with mock cDNA and therefore not expressing endogenous MUC1 did not show the coprecipitating pro - teins ( Fig 10E , lanes 1 ) . To further our understanding of MUC1 - ARF function , it would be highly informative to knockout MUC1 - ARF expression in cells that naturally express MUC1 - ARF protein and look at the resulting phenotype . However the entire MUC1 - ARF protein coding region , including the initiation codons directing MUC1 - ARF protein expression , is an integral component of the MUC1 - TM reading frame ( Fig 2 ) . As a result , knocking out MUC1 - ARF expression inevitably means that MUC1 - TM protein produced in these cells will be truncated . Whatever phenotype is seen in such cells could not be unambiguously ascribed to the lack of MUC1 - ARF ; it could just as well be attributed to expression of a truncated MUC1 - TM protein . Thus knocking out MUC1 - ARF expression , for example by CRISPR technology , is not a feasible experimental approach to learn about MUC1 - ARF function . Much information on MUC1 - TM function has been gained by identifying proteins that interact with MUC1 - TM . In a similar manner , identification of proteins interacting with MUC1 - ARF in cells that natively express MUC1 - ARF could shed light on MUC1 - ARF func - tion . To identify such proteins , we prepared lysates from MCF7 cells ( that express MUC1 - ARF , see above Fig 6 ) and MUC1 - ARF protein was immunoprecipitated using anti - MUC1 - ARF monoclonal antibody MPR2G10 prebound to Protein A / G agarose beads . Proteins associated with the beads were then trypsin digested , followed by mass spectrometricanalyses . Addition of MUC1 - ARF repeat peptide consistently competed out MPR2G10 monoclonal antibody immunoreactivity in all modalities employed including immunofluorescence , immunohis - tochemistry , ELISA assays and western blotting , and in all cells expressing MUC1 - ARF includ - ing cell transfectants expressing the human MUC1 gene , cell lines endogenously expressing the ( b ) . DAPI - stained nuclei and merged images are shown in ( c ) and ( d ) , respectively . Followingprolonged cytokine treatment , MUC1 - ARF expression shifted in part to membrane protrusions , indicatedby yellow arrows . ( E ) Cell lysates were preparedfrom HK293 cells transiently transfected with an expressionvector driving expression of MUC1 cDNA ( lanes 2 ) or with a control empty expression vector ( lanes 1 ) . Anti - MUC1 - ARF immunprecipitates were resolved on SDS - PAGE , western blotted , and probed with antibodies as indicated . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0165031 . g010 MUC1 - ARF—A Novel Nuclear - Resident MUC1 Protein PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0165031 October 21 , 2016 22 / 34 MUC1 gene , and in human tissues expressing the MUC1 gene . To eliminate the possibility of non - specific antibody binding , MUC1 - ARF protein was immunoprecipitated , either in the absence of competing MUC1 - ARF peptide or in its presence . Only those proteins that showed a significant mass spectrometric signal in the absence of ARF peptide and a complete ' compet - ing - out ' of signal ( a reading of " 0 " ) in the presence of ARF peptide were deemed to be true proteins that interact with MUC1 - ARF . This analysis yielded two prominently interacting pro - teins , Glucose - 6 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) and Dynamin 2 ( DNM2 ) , whereas all other proteins gave substantially lower signals . Tryptic digestion releases Protein A and Protein G peptides from the affinity support matrix ( Protein A / G agarose beads ) - these peptides repre - sent approximately 1 . 5 % of total spectra . As an indication of their abundance , G6PD and DNM2 yielded percentage values of total spectra of 0 . 16 % and 0 . 11 % , respectively , and both proteins gave zero readings in the samples that had been immunoprecipitated in the presence of MUC1 - ARF peptide demonstrating their binding specificity . When viewed in relation to the abundant Protein A and Protein G peptides , the values recorded for G6PD and DNM2 are exceptionally high . Discussion We demonstrate here that translation of MUC1 mRNA in an alternate reading frame generates MUC1 - ARF protein , which differs in its entirety from the amino acid sequence of its tumor - associated ' parent ' protein , MUC1 - TM ( Figs 1 and 2 ) . MUC1 - ARF is comprised of 49 amino acids N - terminal to the tandem repeat domain , followed by the tandem repeat domain and finally by a C - terminal domain of 175 amino acids . Since the MUC1 - TM tandem repeat domain has a lower limit of about 300 amino acids ( 15 copies of a twenty amino acid repeat unit [ 19 , 25 , 39 – 41 ] ) , the complete MUC1 - ARF protein must contain at least 524 amino acids making it as far as we are aware , the largest protein reported to date generated by an overlap - ping alternate reading frame . The studies reported here demonstrate unequivocal expression of the frameshifted MUC1 - ARF protein in MUC1 cell transfectants , in MUC1 - expressing cancer cell lines , and in sections of normal and malignant human tissues . In normal tissues , expression of the MUC1 - ARF and MUC1 - TM proteins showed a tight correlation , such that epithelial cells forming ducts in the pancreas and kidney expressed not only MUC1 - TM , but also clearly expressed MUC1 - ARF ( Figs 7 and 8 ) . The contrary was also true : tissues such as brain and liver which do not express MUC1 - TM do not express MUC1 - ARF . Similarly , ductal epithelial cells of resting breast tissue showed very low MUC1 - TM expression , accompanied by almost undetectable lev - els of MUC1 - ARF . Mass spectrometricanalyses were ineffective in identifying peptides contained within the MUC1 - ARF protein , and several possibilities could explain the inability of this modality to identify MUC1 - ARF . It may well be that MUC1 - ARF undergoes post - translational modifica - tions on multiple amino acid residues ( see above in Results for the MotifScan analysis ) , the type of which we do not presently know , rendering its identification by mass spectrometry intractable . Such post - translational modifications or combinations thereof appearing in the protein either stoichiometrically or / and substoichiometrically , could include , yet not be restricted to , methylation , phosphorylation and / or O - GlcNAcylation [ 42 ] , the latter of which is known to be particularly prevalent on nuclear - resident proteins , such as MUC1 - ARF . In this context it is pertinent to note that the latest review of a flurry of recent studies uncovering the unexplored alternative ORF proteome ( AltORFs ) [ 43 ] , notes that mass spectrometryexperi - ments often lack the sensitivity or technical details required for detection of all proteins , as appears to be the case for MUC1 - ARF . MUC1 - ARF—A Novel Nuclear - Resident MUC1 Protein PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0165031 October 21 , 2016 23 / 34 In contrast to this , the evidence presented here that MUC1 - ARF is expressed as a protein is strikingly convincing : ( i ) its expression is seen only in cells that express the human MUC1 gene ( Figs 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 and 8 ) ( ii ) mouse cells that do not express human MUC1 are negative for MUC1 - ARF whereas the same cells transfected with and expressing human MUC1 DNA express MUC1 - ARF , as observedby immunofluorescence , western blots , flow cytometryand ELISA assays ( Figs 3 and 4 ) , ( iii ) MUC1 - ARF expression was detected not only with the anti - MUC1 - ARF monoclonal antibody MPR2G10 , but also with purified anti - MUC1 - ARF poly - clonal antisera as well as with an additional two independently isolated anti - MUC1 - ARF monoclonal antibodies ( Fig 3 ) , and ( iv ) MUC1 - ARF immunoreactivity was in all cases abro - gated by the addition of MUC1 - ARF specific peptide , and not by non - specific peptides . Consti - tuting perhaps the most forceful piece of evidence , ( v ) the immunohistochemical analyses performed on unmanipulated normal human tissues clearly show MUC1 - ARF protein that localizes to the cell nucleus ( Figs 7 , 8 and 9 ) . Particularly compelling is the picture seen with normal kidney tissue ( Fig 7 ) where MUC1 - ARF localizes to the nuclei of only those epithelial cells lining the ducts of distal tubules . All other cells within the same section of kidney tissue are unequivocally negative for MUC1 - ARF . In the kidney , this discrete expression of MUC1 - ARF correlates precisely with the distribution of MUC1 - TM expression , which is restricted solely to the identical ductal - forming epithelial cells of the distal tubules . Comparison of sequential kidney sections stained for either MUC1 - TM or MUC1 - ARF clearly reveals that those cells expressing MUC1 - TM also express MUC1 - ARF . Within the same section , epithelial cells other than those forming the lumen of distal tubules serve admirably both for antibody specificity and as negative controls . They are all negative not only for MUC1 - TM but also for MUC1 - ARF . Further bolstering this evidence for the in - vivo expression of MUC1 - ARF are the analyses of MUC1 protein expression in the normal pancreas ( Figs 7 and 8 ) . In the pancreas , a similar situation pertains to that seen in the kidney , in that both MUC1 - TM and MUC1 - ARF are clearly expressed in acinar and ductal cells of the exocrine pancreas ( Figs 7 and 8 ) . In con - trast to the pancreatic acinar and ductal cells , the pancreatic islets forming the endocrine pan - creas do not express MUC1 - TM as we demonstrate here ( Fig 8 ) and as is known from the literature [ 28 ] . Consistent with this , MUC1 - ARF is unambiguously absent from the pancreatic islet cells , just as is MUC1 - TM ( Fig 8 ) . Additional evidence for expression of MUC1 - ARF protein was provided by ( vi ) Analyses of MUC1 - ARF protein expression by western blots in cell lines that were in parallel analyzed for expression of MUC1 mRNA by qPCR analyses ( Fig 6 ) . Without exception , we observedan absolute correlation of MUC1 - ARF protein expression to expression of MUC1 mRNA . The converse was also true in that all cell lines that did not show MUC1 mRNA expression , were likewise negative for MUC1 - ARF protein ( Fig 6 ) . ( vii ) Polymorphic allelic forms of the MUC1 - ARF protein were observedin those cell lines expressing the MUC1 - ARF protein , con - sistent with the known allelic polymorphism of the MUC1 gene itself ( Fig 6 ) . Finally , ( viii ) the smaller MUC1 - ARF allele was always expressed at significantly higher levels as compared to expression of the larger allele consistent with previously published data on expression of MUC1 mRNA ( 25 ) . Taken together , the experimental evidence detailed in the Results section ( Figs 1 , 3 – 10 ) , and summarized above [ items ( i ) – ( viii ) ] compellingly favors MUC1 - ARF pro - tein expression and makes it highly unlikely , if not untenable , that the MUC1 - ARF protein is an experimental artifact . Among its multiple functions , cell - surface MUC1 - TM acts to protect the cell from foreign organisms such as bacteria and viruses [ 44 – 47 ] . Consistent with this is our finding that MUC1 gene expression , including that of MUC1 - ARF , is markedly upregulated by interferons and other cytokines ( Fig 10 ) . Correspondingly , a single STAT responsive element has been identi - fied within the MUC1 promoter , that when mutated both decreases MUC1 promoter activity MUC1 - ARF—A Novel Nuclear - Resident MUC1 Protein PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0165031 October 21 , 2016 24 / 34 in breast cancer cells and also abolishes stimulation by interleukin - 6 and interferon - gamma [ 35 ] . Expression of both MUC1 - TM and MUC1 - ARF may in fact be favored in environments that are conducive to the growth of foreign organisms , such as within the lumen of distal renal tubules , as we observedhere ( Fig 6 ) . In keeping with this , resting normal breast comprising ductal tissue through which little if any fluid flows demonstrates low expression of both MUC1 - TM and MUC1 - ARF . This contrasts with lactating breast , where high levels of MUC1 - TM protein are present on the apical surfaces of epithelial cells forming ducts involved in lactation [ 48 ] . It has been amply documented that MUC1 - TM transduces signals from the extracellular space into the cell via tyrosine phosphorylation of its cytoplasmic domain [ 49 ] which then recruits second messenger signaling proteins such as Grb2 and beta catenin [ 49 – 54 ] . Following its binding to STAT3 and nuclear factor - kappa - b ( NF - kappa - b ) , the cytoplasmic MUC1 - TM domain re - localizes from the cell membrane to the cell nucleus , and can modulate the activity of the NF - kappa - b pathway by interacting with , and activating NF - kappa - b p65 and family members of IKK [ 55 ] . It is intriguing therefore that MUC1 - ARF not only localizes primarily to the cell nucleus , but also binds the SH3 - domain containing proteins Abl and cortactin . In fact , because of the tandem repeat of its proline - rich binding motif , MUC1 - ARF protein likely con - tains multiple docking sites for signaling proteins , suggesting that MUC1 - ARF may serve as a scaffold capable of binding multiple copies of [ SH3 - domain ] - containing proteins . It is notable then that the cytoplasmic domain in the beta - subunit of the MUC1 - TM protein undergoes phosphorylation on a series of tyrosine residues thereby complexing to SH2 - domain - contain - ing signaling proteins including the Abl tyrosine kinase [ 56 ] . Furthermore , like the Abl tyrosine kinase [ 57 ] MUC1 - ARF localizes both to the cytoplasm and to the nucleus , suggesting that MUC1 - ARF could serve to facilitate the shuttling of bound signaling proteins to and from the nucleus . Following the initial discovery of MUC1 - TM tyrosine phosphorylation [ 49 ] understanding MUC1 - TM function has been considerably enhanced by identifying proteins interacting with the MUC1 - TM protein . A similar approach was therefore used here to gain insight into MUC1 - ARF function . By mass spectrometricanalyses of proteins interacting with MUC1 - ARF , we found that Glucose - 6 - phosphate 1 - dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) and Dynamin 2 ( DNM2 ) were the highest scoring proteins interacting with MUC1 - ARF . Recent work has demonstrated that MUC1 - TM acts as a novel metabolic master regulator by acting as a tran - scriptional coactivator thereby regulating expression of metabolic genes [ reviewed in [ 58 ] ] . Because of this , the interaction of MUC1 - ARF with G6PD , an important metabolic regulator , is particularly intriguing . G6PD is a significant metabolic regulator that provides reducing power ( NADPH ) and pentose phosphates for fatty acid and nucleic acid synthesis . MUC1 - ARF interaction with G6PD may act to modulate G6PD activity thereby acting similarly to MUC1 - TM as a metabolic regulator ( 58 ) . MUC1 - ARF interaction with dynamin 2 , a GTPase that facilitates vesicle fission during synaptic vesicle endocytosis , is also of interest because the C - terminal domain of dynamin is a proline - rich domain ( PRD ) very similar in make - up to the proline - rich domain of the MUC1 - ARF tandem repeats [ 59 , 60 ] . Dynamin is recruited to sites of endocytosis by interact - ing with the SH3 domains of a variety of proteins , via dynamin PXXP motifs ( where X repre - sents any amino acid ) that are flanked on either side by a basic residue such as arginine . Such PXXP motifs are particularly prevalent in the MUC1 - ARF tandem repeats ( see Results ) , and appear there as PRAP , PPPP , PPQP , PRTP and PGRP . It therefore may well be that protein ( s ) containing two or more SH3 domains bridge between dynamin 2 and MUC1 - ARF . Signifi - cantly , dynamin interacts with cortactin , which comprises a well characterized SH3 domain [ 61 , 62 ] and is an actin - binding protein shown to participate in receptor - mediated endocytosis . MUC1 - ARF—A Novel Nuclear - Resident MUC1 Protein PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0165031 October 21 , 2016 25 / 34 Regulation of receptor - mediated endocytosis requires remodeling of actin filaments involving dynamin2 GTPase activity that is dependent on its interaction with the F - actin - binding protein cortactin [ 63 ] . Because it has been extensively documented that cell surface receptor regulation involves both dynamin and a number of SH3 domain - containing proteins such as cortactin ( for example [ 64 – 67 ] , the interaction of MUC1 - ARF not only with dynamin 2 but also with cortactin ( Fig 10 , Panel E ) suggests that MUC1 - ARF may also be involved in the regulation of cell surface receptors . As compelling as the above evidence is , the definitive nature of MUC1 - ARF function remains to be determined . Parental and ARF proteins expressed from the same gene are often functionally linked . For example , the proteins p16INK4A and p19ARF proteins are both expressed from a common ARF / INK4A locus , and act as tumor suppressor proteins and function in similar pathways [ 8 ] . Interestingly , the protein ALEX derived by alternate frame reading of the mRNA coding for the G - protein alpha - subunit XLas physically interacts with the XL - domain of the ‘parent’ XLas gene product , such that both parent and ARF proteins act in concert [ 10 , 68 ] . Such physical interaction between ' parent ' and ARF proteins is also seen between Xbp1 ( S ) protein , a tran - scription factor that participates in the unfolded protein response , and Xbp1 ( U ) - ARF protein generated by alternate reading frame translation of an unspliced Xbp mRNA [ 69 , 70 ] . Simi - larly , the overlapping reading frame in the ataxin - 1 coding sequence encodes a novel protein that also interacts with the ' parental ' ataxin - 1 protein [ 71 ] . The pattern emerging from these findings is that despite very different amino acid sequences of expressed ARF proteins com - pared to their ' parent ' proteins , ARF proteins can be functionally linked to their ' parent ' pro - teins . We do not as yet know with any degree of certainty , whether the MUC1 - TM and MUC1 - ARF proteins are in fact functionally linked as is the case for parental and ARF proteins cited above . MUC1 - ARF is a very basic protein , rich in proline residues that comprise about 35 % of the tandem repeat sequence . This structural make - up is in line with other ARF proteins that are basic and show a conspicuous bias for a high proline content suggesting an increase in the level of structural disorder . For example , the ALEX protein has a predicted pI of 11 . 8 with a 21 % proline content [ 10 ] and the ARF protein derived from the INK4 locus is composed of approxi - mately 20 % arginine residues [ 8 ] . Because of its high proline content , MUC1 - ARF appears to be natively unstructured , just as are ALEX and p19 ARF . Of note , both ALEX and p19 ARF form specific and tight interactions with partner proteins , and p19 ARF acquires activity and stability only when bound to targets [ 72 ] . In contrast to localization of MUC1 - TM to the cell surface , MUC1 - ARF localizes to the cell nucleus , as observedin normal kidney and pancreas as well as in breast cancer tissues ( Figs 5 – 8 ) . The cytoplasmic domain of MUC1 - TM has been observedto also localize to the cell nucleus [ 50 ] , thus highlighting the similarity of MUC1 - ARF and MUC1 - TM . Proteins locating at and functioning in the nucleus frequently contain nuclear localization signals ( NLS ) , required for translocation through the nuclear pore complex . These typically contain clusters of basic amino acids , usually flanked by proline residues , and many NLS motifs appear in pairs ( bipartite NLS signals ) or even as multiple signals within the one protein [ 73 ] . Although there is no canonical nuclear localization signal present in the MUC1 - ARF protein , it is notable that the MUC1 - ARF tandem repeat itself comprises the proline - arginine rich motifs PRAPP , PRPR and GRPR . In this context , various FGF2 and FGF3 protein isoforms , especially those initiating at upstream alternative initiation sites , localize to the cell nucleus [ 74 – 76 ] not because they contain a canonical nuclear localization signal , but because they also comprise motifs such as PRAAP , PRTR and GRGR very similar to those seen in the MUC1 - ARF tandem repeat ( compare FGF / MUC1 - ARF motifs - PRAAP / PRAPP , PRTR / PRPR and GRGR / GRPR ) . It is therefore possible that just as in the case of the FGF2 and FGF3 MUC1 - ARF—A Novel Nuclear - Resident MUC1 Protein PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0165031 October 21 , 2016 26 / 34 proteins , proline - arginine rich motifs within the MUC1 - ARF tandem repeat direct nuclear localization of MUC1 - ARF . In contrast to the significant expression of both MUC1 - TM and of MUC1 - ARF on the api - cal surfaces of normal luminal epithelial cells present both in the kidney and those forming the exocrine pancreatic ducts and acini ( Figs 7 and 8 ) , the normal luminal epithelial cell of the rest - ing non - lactating breast expresses very low levels if at all of these MUC1 proteins . Epithelial cells of breast cancer tissue , however , show in many instances very high MUC1 - TM expression . The accepted consensus is that this increased expression in breast cancer cells in some way links MUC1 - TM protein to a malignant phenotype [ see review [ 15 ] ] . Increased expression of MUC1 - TM taken as the single parameter , however , without taking into account the tissue architecture of MUC1 - expressing cells has been shown not to have prognostic significance [ 77 ] . In a study encompassing more than 1 , 300 cases of breast cancer it was clearly shown that the specific tissue architecture of MUC1 - expressing cells has prognostic value : cytoplasmic expression with circumferential membranous MUC1 - TM localization was unmistakably associated with a worse prognosis , whereas apical , luminal expression predicted a favorable outcome . Thus not only is tissue type ( breast tissue versus kidney and / or pancreatic tissues ) important in considering the relevance of MUC1 expression to malignant phenotype , but also the spatial organization of MUC1 expression on malignant epithelial cells can be deter - minant . Breast cancer cannot be considered to be one homogeneous disease . Indeed molecular expression signatures [ 78 ] have identified at least 5 major breast cancer types - luminal A , lumi - nal B , basal , HER2 - enriched and normal - like [ [ 79 ] and references contained therein ] , and although this broad classification has prognostic implications , such prognostic forecasting is not at all times clear - cut . The luminal A subtype , with a better prognosis , and luminal B sub - type with a worse prognosis are both considered to be derived from the breast luminal epithe - lial cell . Yet these two subtypes are particularly difficult to differentiate one from the other , and in this regard our studies on MUC1 - ARF expression may help to discriminate the luminal A and luminal B subtypes . MUC1 - ARF expression , as shown here , is seen only in a select sub - group ( ~ 40 % ) of those breast tumors that express MUC1 - TM , and thus may designate a breast cancer subtype with a specific prognostic outcome for the following reasons . Because normal pancreatic and kidney cells coexpress both MUC1 - TM and MUC1 - ARF , thus typifying the MUC1 expression pattern of a normal epithelial cell ( both MUC1 - TM and MUC1 - ARF ) , it would appear as if the subtype of breast cancers that also coexpress both MUC1 - TM and MUC1 - ARF , a signature MUC1 - expression pattern reflecting the normal epithelial cell , may have a better prognosis than those tumors that express only MUC1 - TM . The tissue architec - ture of MUC1 - TM and MUC1 - ARF expressing cells , as describedabove , might also be a factor . The unambiguous prognostic significance of MUC1 - ARF expression ( or the lack of its expres - sion ) together with MUC1 - TM will require the further analysis of much larger population samples . In cancer tissues , expression of MUC1 - ARF protein was highly dependent on the tissue in question . Pancreatic cancers , known for their aggressive malignant phenotype , showed a loss of MUC1 - ARF expression , as compared to high MUC1 - ARF expression in epithelial cells from normal pancreatic tissue . In contrast , a number of human breast cancer samples showed pref - erential MUC1 - ARF expression in the cancer cell population , with little to no expression in normal breast tissue , suggesting that just as the transmembrane MUC1 protein is preferen - tially overexpressed in transformed breast epithelial cells , so too is the MUC1 - ARF protein . Although in these samples MUC1 - ARF expression segregated with MUC1 - TM expression , it did so in only a restricted subset of the MUC1 - TM positive samples , implying that mechanisms other than the mere presence of MUC1 mRNA determine MUC1 - ARF expression and that regulatory controls ultimately govern which reading frame ( s ) are translated , and to what MUC1 - ARF—A Novel Nuclear - Resident MUC1 Protein PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0165031 October 21 , 2016 27 / 34 extent . Possible mechanisms include leaky scanning , ribosomal shunting and mechanisms pro - moting use of internal ribosomal entry sites . As demonstrated here , a diversity of cytokines induce MUC1 - ARF expression , suggesting that a specific milieu of cytokines and growth fac - tors present in the tumor microenvironment may govern its restricted expression . This in turn could define a cancer subtype , wherein MUC1 - ARF positivity confers prognostic significance , as also discussed above . The intracellular distribution of MUC1 - ARF protein , whether nuclear or / and cytoplasmic , may also be important , and extensive immunohistochemical studies will be required to see whether the quantitative and qualitative changes in MUC1 - ARF expression in breast cancer tissue indeed have prognostic significanceto disease outcome . The expression of a given protein by normal non - malignant cells does not preclude link - age of that protein to a malignant phenotype . This linkage to malignancy may be seen as an altered pattern of expression of the protein , that could involve a quantitative alteration in its level of expression or / and in its cellular localization . A case in point , clearly pertinent to this report is that of MUC1 - TM itself , which is universally accepted as linked in some way to breast cancer ( see above and for a recent review [ 15 ] ) , despite the fact that MUC1 - TM is extensively expressed on epithelial cells of , amongst others , the normal pancreas , kidney and normal , lactating breast . Further emphasizing this point are the well - known examples of the normal cellular proteins epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , HER2 ( epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ) and estrogen receptor ( ER ) . It is their inappropriate expression that inextricably links these proteins to a malignant phenotype , and it is universally accepted that EGFR , HER2 and ER are unambiguously linked to the breast cancer cell . Indeed cancer thera - pies such as antibodies targeting EGFR and HER2 [ for example [ 80 , 81 ] ] as well as inhibitors of estrogen receptor activity are extensively used in the clinic . Yet notwithstanding their undisputed relevance to cancer , it is a well - known fact that EGFR , HER2 and ER are all expressed in normal cells , in which they play critical roles in normal cell growth and differen - tiation [ 82 ] . It is their inappropriate expression - quantitatively and qualitatively , spatially and temporally - just as we show here for MUC1 - ARF , that links these proteins to the malig - nant cell . The murine MUC1 gene and its protein product [ 83 ] show major differences compared to those of primates and humans . In the mouse , the region spanning from the MUC1 - TM initi - ation AUG codon to the tandem repeat domain encompasses only 41 amino acids , whereas in humans it comprises 125 amino acids . It is precisely within this segment that the human ARF initiation codon is located and it is likely that because of this difference between human and mouse , the mouse MUC1 gene does not generate a MUC1 - ARF protein . The mouse tandem repeat domain contains two additional crucial differences from that of primates : Whereas in primates the number of repeats can vary in any allele from ~ 15 – 125 repeats [ 19 ] , the number of repeats is fixed in the mouse at an invariable 16 repeats [ 83 ] . Furthermore , the mouse repeat sequences themselves are far more divergent from each other as compared to the human and primate repeat sequences which are very similar one to the other [ 25 , 84 ] . It thus appears that mammals higher up on the evolutionary ladder , such as primates and humans , have developed a more complex MUC1 gene that is reflected in differences in the region from the MUC1 - TM start codon until the tandem repeat domain as well as in the repeat domain itself . Although facilitating the synthesis of the MUC1 - ARF protein in addi - tion to MUC1 - TM as shown here , this sophistication exacts a price from the cellular machin - eries that must cope with the non - trivial tasks of faithful replication and transcription of highly conserved GC - rich sequences , as found in the tandem repeat sequences and those immediately flanking it . That mistakes can occur here is amply demonstrated by the recent report on a mutation within the MUC1 tandem repeat which results in medullary cystic kid - ney disease 1 ( MCKD1 ) [ 85 ] . MUC1 - ARF—A Novel Nuclear - Resident MUC1 Protein PLOS ONE | DOI : 10 . 1371 / journal . pone . 0165031 October 21 , 2016 28 / 34 The human MUC1 gene has been previously shown to generate not only the transmem - brane mucin - like protein that comprises a highly glycosylated tandem repeat domain , but addi - tional alternative isoforms designated MUC1 - X , MUC1 - Y and MUC1 - ZD [ 20 – 22 , 86 ] , that are generated by differential splicing events . Like MUC1 - TM , both MUC1 - X and MUC1 - Y are transmembrane proteins . Yet in distinction to MUC1 - TM they are both devoid of the central tandem repeat domain , that is spliced out using splice donor and acceptor sites located upstream and downstream to the tandem repeat array . Interestingly , the MUC1 - ZD pro - tein [ 86 ] utilizes the same splice donor site to that used by MUC1 - X and MUC1 - Y , yet the alternative MUC1 - ZD splice acceptor site located downstream to the tandem repeat array leads to a downstream frameshifted sequence initiating with the amino acid sequence IPAPTTTKSCR . . . and terminating with GQDLWWYN . This C - terminal region of MUC1 - ZD contains 43 amino acids , a region that is identical to the C - terminal portion of the MUC1 - ARF protein reported here . Despite the identity of this C - terminal region , it is clear that these two MUC1 proteins localize to different cellular / extracellularcompartments - MUC1 - ZD is likely a secreted protein [ 86 ] , whereas MUC1 - ARF is a nuclear and cytoplasmic protein , as shown here . The overall scheme , that of a secreted protein and a nuclear / cyto - plasmic protein both being derived from the same gene , is also observedwith the FGF proteins . Some FGF protein isoforms are secreted proteins and others localize to the cytoplasmic / nuclear compartments , yet all derive from the same gene [ for example [ 87 , 88 ] ] . Until very recently the scope of proteome diversity in eukaryotic organisms was thought to be determined primarily by canonical mechanisms such as utilization of alternative promoters , alternative splicing , usage of alternative adenylation sites and RNA editing . This canon is now being seriously challenged by the realization that enhancement of proteome diversity by non - canonical mechanisms , such as dual - coding mRNAs [ 43 ] , wherein a single mRNA is decoded not only in the canonical reading frame , but also in alternative reading frames , is far more com - mon than previously envisioned [ 2 ] . Here we have shown that the MUC1 gene generates a MUC1 mRNA that yields more than a single protein , resulting not only in the well - character - ized tumor - associated MUC1 - TM protein , but also a novel MUC1 - ARF protein . Furthermore MUC1 - ARF represents the longest eukaryotic ARF protein heretofore reported . In addition to enhancing our understanding of MUC1 gene involvement in the malignant transformation of cells , the discovery of MUC1 - ARF furthers , at the more general level , our appreciation of dual - coding mechanisms in expanding proteome diversity .
