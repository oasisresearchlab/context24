Arp2 / 3 complex is a key actin filament nucleator that assembles branched actin networks in response to cellular signals . The activity of Arp2 / 3 complex is regulated by both activating and inhibitory proteins . Coronins make up a large class of actin binding proteins previously shown to inhibit Arp2 / 3 complex . While coronins are known to play a role in controlling actin dynamics in diverse processes , including endocytosis and cell motility , the precise mechanism by which they regulate Arp2 / 3 complex is unclear . We conducted a detailed biochemical analysis of budding yeast coronin , Crn1 , and found that it not only inhibits Arp2 / 3 complex , but also activates it . We mapped regions required for activation and found that Crn1 contains a sequence called CA , which is conserved in WASp / Scar proteins , the prototypical activators of Arp2 / 3 complex . Point mutations in CA abolished activation of Arp2 / 3 complex by Crn1 in vitro . Confocal microscopy and quantitative actin patch tracking showed that these mutants had defective endocytic actin patch dynamics in S . cerevisiae , indicating that activation of Arp2 / 3 complex by coronin is required for normal actin dynamics in vivo . The switch between the dual modes of regulation by Crn1 is controlled by concentration , and low concentrations of Crn1 enhance filament binding by Arp2 / 3 complex while high concentrations block binding . Our data support a direct tethering recruitment model for activation of Arp2 / 3 complex by Crn1 , and suggest that Crn1 indirectly inhibits Arp2 / 3 complex by blocking it from binding actin filaments . Regulation of actin polymerization is critical for orchestrating complex cellular processes , including endocytosis , cell division , cellular differentiation , and motility ( 1 ) . Arp2 / 3 ( Actin related protein 2 / 3 ) complex is a key actin regulator that nucleates branched actin filaments and initiates the assembly of highly crosslinked actin networks ( 2 ) . Arp2 / 3 complex is tightly regulated , and proteins with both activating and inhibitory influence act on the complex in vivo . The best studied activators are the WASp / SCAR family proteins , which bind directly to Arp2 / 3 complex and actin monomers , initiating an activating conformational change and recruiting the first actin subunits for the nascent ( daughter ) filament ( 3 , 4 ) . A second class of activators , referred to as class II nucleation promoting factors ( NPFs ) , lacks actin monomer binding regions and instead binds actin filaments ( 2 ) . Class II NPFs , best represented by the Src kinase substrate cortactin , are thought to activate by recruiting Arp2 / 3 complex to the sides of actin filaments , but the precise mechanism is unknown ( 5 , 6 ) . In the absence of NPFs , Arp2 / 3 complex has weak or no nucleation activity . However , inhibitors of Arp2 / 3 complex play important roles in controlling the activity of the complex in vivo ( 7 - 11 ) , suggesting that multiple layers of regulation of Arp2 / 3 complex are required for controlling the assembly of cellular actin networks . In budding yeast , Arp2 / 3 complex nucleates patches of cortical branched actin networks required for endocytosis ( 12 ) . Actin patches contain at least six different Arp2 / 3 regulators ( Las17 , Pan1 , Myo3 , Myo5 , Abp1 , and Crn1 ) ( 13 ) . Five of these proteins have been shown to activate the complex in vitro , and in vivo experiments have demonstrated that despite some functional overlap , all five NPFs contribute to actin patch assembly ( 13 - 16 ) . Coronin , an Arp2 / 3 complex inhibitor present in yeast actin patches , plays a role in regulating the dynamics of the patches ( 13 , 17 - 19 ) , which assemble at the cortex as the endocytic vesicle forms and then disassemble as the vesicle moves into the cytoplasm to fuse with endosomes ( 20 ) . Actin polymerization is thought to provide force for invagination of endocytic vesicles and may propel 1 http : / / www . jbc . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1074 / jbc .

Deletion of coronin increases the duration of both the assembly and mobile phases , indicating that coronin is involved in fine tuning actin dynamics during endocytosis ( 13 ) . Unlike other known cellular Arp2 / 3 complex inhibitors , coronins have been shown to both inhibit and directly interact with Arp2 / 3 complex ( 9 , 18 ) . However , the mechanism of inhibition is not known , and it is currently unclear how coronin is involved in tuning actin patch dynamics . Here we describe the biochemical dissection of the mechanism of regulation of Arp2 / 3 complex by budding yeast coronin , Crn1 . To our surprise , we found that this coronin not only inhibits Arp2 / 3 complex , but also activates it , and therefore has dual modes of regulation . The concentration of coronin controls the switch between the regulatory modes : low concentrations activate Arp2 / 3 complex and high concentrations inhibit the complex . We show that Crn1 is a type II NPF with a previously undiscovered CA sequence within its central unique region , and that mutations of this sequence abolish activation of the complex in vitro and slow patch assembly in vivo . Our data support a model by which at low concentrations , Crn1 recruits the complex to the sides of actin filaments and activates it . Activation is synergistic with Las17 , the budding yeast WASp homologue , but does not require Las17 . We also propose a model for the switch between regulatory modes of Crn1 in which high concentrations of Crn1 inhibit nucleation by blocking Arp2 / 3 complex binding sites on actin filaments . Experimental Procedures Budding yeast Arp2 / 3 complex , Crn1 , Las17 - VCA , and N - WASp - VCA proteins were purified as described in the supplementary materials . Actin was purified , labeled with pyrene iodoacetamide , and the increase in fluorescence measured to monitor polymerization as previously described ( 22 ) . Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out in a Beckman XL - I analytical ultracentrifuge as described in the supplementary materials . Fluorescence anisotropy competition experiments were carried out as described previously ( 22 ) and analyzed as described in the supplementary materials . Detailed procedures for all other methods can be found in the supplementary materials . RESULTS Crn1 activates Arp2 / 3 complex - To determine how coronin regulates Arp2 / 3 complex we used a pyrene - actin polymerization assay to measure the rates of polymerization of actin filaments in the presence of Arp2 / 3 complex , Las17 - VCA , and a range of concentrations of Crn1 . Low micromolar concentrations inhibited Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated nucleation , as previously reported for human and yeast coronins ( Fig . 1A , ( 18 , 23 ) ) . The rate of polymer formation was equal to actin alone when 3 . 0 µM or more coronin was added to our assays , suggesting that Arp2 / 3 was completely inhibited under these conditions . At high Crn1 concentrations , we observed fluctuations in the emission values in late stages of the reaction and increased total fluorescence , which we attributed to filament bundling , a previously reported activity of coronin ( 24 ) . Surprisingly , we found that low concentrations of coronin increased the rate of polymer formation ( Fig . 1 A and B ) . The maximal rate of actin assembly increased and the lag phase decreased with more coronin added , up to an optimal concentration range of 50 - 100 nM . In the presence of Las17 - VCA , the maximal rate of polymer formation was approximately two fold higher at 100 nM coronin than with no coronin . Las17 - VCA was not required , since coronin alone increased the polymerization rate in the presence of Arp2 / 3 complex , though not as efficiently as Las17 - VCA ( Fig . 1 B and C ) . As the rate increase is dependent on the presence of Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . S1 ) but did not require Las17 - VCA , we concluded that Crn1 activates Arp2 / 3 complex . The unique region of Crn1 contains C and A sequences required for activation - To determine how Crn1 activates Arp2 / 3 complex , we mapped regions of Crn1 required for the increased polymerization rate . Crn1 contains a conserved N - terminal WD repeat domain which binds to actin filaments ( 25 , 26 ) , a C - terminal predicted coiled coil , and a non - conserved central region of 197 amino acids predicted to be unstructured ( 27 ) ( Fig . 2A ) . Deletion of either the coiled - coil ( Crn1 - WDU ) or the WD repeat domain ( Crn1 - UCC ) abolished activation ( Fig . 2B ) . A Crn1 construct 2 by gu e s t on N ov e m b e r 17 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m ( Crn1WD - CC ) lacking the unique region also failed to activate Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 2B ) , so all three regions of Crn1 contribute to activation . Humphries , et . al . demonstrated that Arp2 / 3 complex and Crn1 interact directly in pull down experiments and that the C - terminal half of Crn1 ( residues 400 - 651 , which includes the entire unique region and the coiled - coil domain ) co - immunoprecipitates with Arp2 / 3 complex in S . cerevisiae lysate ( 18 ) . Therefore , we hypothesized that residues in the C - terminal region might directly interact with Arp2 / 3 complex and contribute to activation . We examined the Crn1 sequence and identified motifs in the unique region similar to the C ( central ) and A ( acidic ) sequences of WASp / Scar family proteins ( Fig . 2C ) , which are known to bind and activate Arp2 / 3 complex ( 28 , 29 ) . The acidic sequence in Crn1 spans residues 503 - 508 and is composed of the sequence WEEADD . Mutation of this sequence to AKKADD ( Crn1 - AKK ) abolished activation ( Fig . 2 D and E ) . In WASp / Scar proteins , the C region is thought to form an amphipathic helix that interacts with Arp2 / 3 complex ( 30 ) and promotes an activating conformational change ( 31 , 32 ) . We mutated three residues within the putative C - region of Crn1 ( 480 - LLKK to ALEE ) and found that this mutant , Crn1 - ALEE did not activate Arp2 / 3 complex alone or with Las17 - VCA ( Fig . 2 D and E ) . We conclude that Crn1 contains sequences homologous to WASp / Scar C and A regions within its unique domain , and that these regions are required for activation . Activation of Arp2 / 3 is required for normal actin patch dynamics in budding yeast - In wild - type S . cerevisiae , actin and actin binding proteins assemble to their peak concentrations in the patches in about 8 s , after which the patches separate from the cortex and move into the cytoplasm ( 15 , 19 , 21 ) . In the crn1 Δ strain , the duration of the assembly phase of an average actin patch is increased by 2 s ( 13 , 19 ) . To determine if activation of Arp2 / 3 complex by Crn1 influences the dynamics of patch assembly , we deleted CRN1 from a haploid strain and reintegrated mutant or wild - type CRN1 genes under control of their native promoters into the leu2 - 3 , 112 locus . To visualize actin patches in live cells , we added a C - terminal GFP - tag to Abp1 , an actin filament binding protein that localizes to actin patches with the same kinetics as actin , Arp2 / 3 complex , and a number of other actin binding proteins ( 15 , 33 ) . We used confocal microscopy to image live cells and then used previously developed automated patch tracking software to follow the trajectories of hundreds of individual actin patches ( 13 ) . Consistent with previous reports , we found that the average duration of the assembly phase of patches increased from 8 . 0 s to 9 . 8 s in the crn1 Δ strain ( Table 1 ) . The ALEE and AKK point mutants , which abolished activation of Arp2 / 3 complex , caused a small but significant increase in the duration of the assembly phase compared to wild type ( 0 . 8 and 0 . 9 s , respectively ) , demonstrating that Arp2 / 3 complex activation by coronin plays a role in fine tuning the dynamics of actin patch assembly . Compared to other Arp2 / 3 complex activators , the change in the duration of the assembly phase is greater than observed when the acidic region of Pan1 is deleted ( ~ 0 . 5 s ) , but less than observed when the acidic region of Las17 is deleted ( ~ 4 s ) ( 13 ) . Neither the ALEE or AKK Crn1 mutants lengthened the assembly phase as much as the coronin knockout , so activation of Arp2 / 3 complex is not the only role coronin plays in actin patch assembly . Low concentrations of Crn1 recruit Arp2 / 3 complex to actin filaments - Because Crn1 was previously only known to inhibit Arp2 / 3 complex , we sought to determine the mechanism of activation to better understand the molecular basis of Arp2 / 3 complex regulation . We first asked whether actin monomer recruitment is important for activation . Monomer recruitment is mediated by the V sequence of the VCA region in type I NPFs , which binds directly to actin monomers and is required for activation by type I NPFs ( 29 , 34 , 35 ) . We did not find a V sequence in Crn1 , and actin monomers did not interact with GST - Crn1 in a pull down assay ( Fig . 3A ) , so it is unlikely that Crn1 activates by recruiting monomers to Arp2 / 3 complex . We next explored the possibility that Crn1 activates Arp2 / 3 complex by recruiting it to the sides of actin filaments . Actin filament binding is necessary for activation of the complex ( 3 , 36 , 37 ) but the complex has low affinity and binds with a slow on rate to actin filaments ( K D ~ 1 - 5 µM , ( 3 , 38 ) ) , while Crn1 binds tightly ( 24 ) . In addition , Humphries , et . al . , reported that 2 . 0 µM Crn1 increased the amount of Arp2 / 3 complex that copellets with actin filaments ( 18 ) . We conducted 3 by gu e s t on N ov e m b e r 17 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m copelleting experiments with a range of concentrations of Crn1 and found that copelleting of Arp2 / 3 complex increased approximately 2 - fold as the Crn1 concentration was increased to 500 nM , then decreased as more Crn1 was added ( Fig . 3B ) . Therefore , at low concentrations , Crn1 recruits Arp2 / 3 to the sides of actin filaments , while high concentrations block Arp2 / 3 from binding . Given that we observed activation only at low concentrations of coronin , recruitment to the filament may explain activation . Crn1 - UCC and Crn1 - WDU , mutants defective in actin filament binding , did not activate the complex ( Fig . 2B , 3 D and F ) , providing further support for this mechanism . Importantly , the Crn1 construct lacking the unique region ( Crn1 - WD - CC ) bound actin filaments with affinity similar to the wild - type Crn1 ( Fig . 3 E and F ) but did not activate Arp2 / 3 complex or recruit it to filaments ( Fig . 2B and 3B ) . A double mutation in the CA region ( Crn1 - ALEE - AKK ) also prevented activation and recruitment ( Fig . 2D and 3G ) . This led us to hypothesize that interaction of Crn1 with both actin filaments and Arp2 / 3 complex is required for recruitment and activation . The Crn1 CA region binds preferentially to the Arp2 site in Arp2 / 3 complex - The CA region from WASp / Scar proteins interacts directly with Arp2 / 3 complex ( 29 , 30 ) , so we reasoned that Crn1 might bind to the complex through its CA sequence . In a fluorescence anisotropy competition binding assay , titration of a complex of rhodamine labeled VCA ( Rh - VCA ) and Arp2 / 3 complex with Crn1 decreased the anisotropy , suggesting that Crn1 competes with Rh - VCA for binding to Arp2 / 3 complex . The anisotropy did not decrease to the level of Rh - VCA alone even at the highest Crn1 concentration ( 80 µM ) , so coronin did not completely displace VCA ( Fig . 4A ) . Multiple lines of evidence suggest that there are two binding sites for VCA on Arp2 / 3 complex ( 39 , 40 ) . We reasoned that like cortactin , a type II NPF that interacts with Arp2 / 3 complex through an N - terminal acidic domain ( 6 ) , Crn1 may bind preferentially to one of these two sites , explaining the failure to compete all Rh - VCA off the complex . To test this , we labeled an engineered cysteine in the C or A regions of N - WASp - VCA ( T464C or E491C ) with benzophenone - 4 - maleimide and used UV radiation to crosslink the benzophenone moiety to interacting residues on the surface of Arp2 / 3 complex . Crosslinking resulted in two high molecular weight bands for each VCA construct ( Fig . 4B ) . Western blotting ( Fig . 4 C and D ) and mass spectrometry identified the top band as Arp3 - VCA and the lower band as Arp2 - VCA . These data indicate that there are two binding sites for CA on Arp2 / 3 complex , consistent with the results of Padrick et . al . ( 40 ) . Addition of full - length Crn1 to the reaction decreased crosslinking to both Arp2 and Arp3 , indicating that Crn1 can block both sites ( Fig . 4 C and D ) . However , the Arp2 site was blocked at lower concentrations than the Arp3 site , suggesting that coronin competes more strongly with VCA at the Arp2 site than at the Arp3 site . We next used the competition assay to map Crn1 domain requirements for binding to the complex . The WD repeat domain was not required for competition with VCA , since Crn1 - UCC displaced VCA in both the anisotropy and crosslinking experiments ( Fig . 4 B and E ) . In contrast , deletion of the entire unique domain ( Crn1 - WD - CC ) abolished competition with VCA ( Fig . 4A ) . The double mutant Crn1 - ALEE - AKK bound to the complex at least 8 fold weaker than Crn1 and did not completely compete Rh - VCA from the complex at 50 µM ( Fig . 4E ) , suggesting that the unique region CA is critical for the interaction with Arp2 / 3 complex . Surprisingly , mutation of either the A or C motifs individually did not prevent competition with VCA ( Fig . 4E ) . The acidic region mutant , Crn1 - AKK , bound only slightly worse than Crn1 ( apparent K D ~ 2 µM , compared to 0 . 6 ± 0 . 2 µM for Crn1 ) and , like Crn1 , did not completely displace VCA . The C region mutant , Crn1 - ALEE , bound more tightly than wild type coronin ( apparent K D = 0 . 3 ± 0 . 05 µM ) , and decreased the anisotropy to the same value as unbound Rh - VCA alone , suggesting that the C - region mutant competes with both VCA binding sites . We do not currently understand why this mutant binds more tightly than wild type Crn1 , but one possibility is that the wild type C sequence inhibits the A region from binding to one of the two CA binding sites on Arp2 / 3 complex . High resolution X - ray crystal structures of CA bound to each site on Arp2 / 3 complex will likely be required to resolve this question . Trimerization of Crn1 is required for activation - Oligomerization of WASp / SCAR 4 by gu e s t on N ov e m b e r 17 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m proteins greatly enhances their potency ( 39 , 41 , 42 ) , so we asked if oligomerization of Crn1 influences its activation potential . We used analytical ultracentrifugation to demonstrate that Crn1 trimerizes ( Fig . 5 ) . Deletion of the coiled - coil domain ( Crn1 - WDU ) , which is known to oligomerize other coronins ( 43 ) , abolished activation by Crn1 ( Fig . 2B ) . To determine the role of the coiled coil in activation , we replaced the coiled - coil domain with a 27 amino acid trimerization domain , called foldon , from bacteriophage T4 fibritin ( 44 ) . This construct , Crn1 - foldon , activated Arp2 / 3 complex and recruited it to actin filaments similarly to wild - type coronin ( Fig . 2B and 3B ) , suggesting oligomerization is the only required function of the coiled coil in activating the complex . Multivalent binding of the WD repeat domains to actin filaments has been proposed previously ( 45 ) , and explains the increased affinity of Crn1 - foldon for actin filaments compared to Crn1 - WDU ( Fig . 3F ) . Crn1 acts synergistically with Las17 - Activation of the complex by Crn1 was enhanced in the presence of the VCA region of Las17 , suggesting that these activators act synergistically . However , since Crn1 shows activation of the complex on its own , it is possible that they act additively rather than synergistically . To test this , we ran actin assembly assays with a range of ratios of Crn1 to VCA , keeping the total activator concentration at 60 nM . Given that Crn1 on its own activates Arp2 / 3 complex more weakly than VCA , maximal activation at 100 % VCA would argue for an additive effect , whereas maximum activation at lower ratios of VCA to Crn1 would indicate that activation is synergistic . We found maximal activation when the molar ratio of Crn1 : VCA was 1 : 1 , demonstrating that Crn1 and VCA act synergistically ( Fig . S2 ) . DISCUSSION Crn1 is an Arp2 / 3 complex activator with similarities to both cortactin and WASp / Scar proteins - We show here that Crn1 activates Arp2 / 3 complex both on its own and synergistically with Las17 - VCA . Activation requires all three regions of Crn1 : the N - terminal WD repeat domain , the central unique domain , and the C - terminal coiled - coil domain . Within the unique region we discovered a CA sequence , a conserved feature of the WASp / Scar family proteins . Like WASp / Scar CA , Crn1 CA is required for activation and interaction with the complex . However , we discovered important mechanistic differences between Crn1 and WASp - mediated activation . First , Crn1 does not contain a V sequence , an actin monomer binding region found N - terminal to CA in WASp / Scar proteins ( 29 , 34 , 35 ) . Not surprisingly , we found that Crn1 failed to bind actin monomers , so we concluded that Crn1 does not activate the complex by recruiting actin monomers to the branch junction , a mechanism proposed for the VCA region of WASp / Scar ( 29 , 34 ) . Second , our anisotropy and crosslinking assays demonstrate that Crn1 CA his distinct binding preferences for Arp2 / 3 complex compared to WASp / Scar CA , since it preferentially competes with one of two WASp / Scar binding sites . In these respects , Crn1 is similar to cortactin , the prototypical type II NPF from higher eukaryotes that , like Crn1 , binds to only one of two activator binding sites on the complex and contains an F - actin binding domain instead of an actin monomer binding domain ( 5 , 6 ) . While functionally this classifies Crn1 as a type II NPF , we note that our data already points to important mechanistic differences between Crn1 and cortactin , since 1 . ) cortactin contains an A but not a C sequence and 2 . ) cortactin binds to the Arp3 subunit while Crn1 preferentially binds Arp2 . Dissection of these differences will likely provide valuable insight into the molecular mechanism of Arp2 / 3 complex activation . The role of filament recruitment in Crn1 - mediated activation of Arp2 / 3 complex - Previous experiments showed that Crn1 recruits Arp2 / 3 complex to actin filaments , but the functional relevance of this observation was unknown ( 18 ) . Here we showed that only low concentrations of Crn1 could increase copelleting of Arp2 / 3 with actin filaments or activate the complex in actin polymerization assays , so recruitment and activation are correlated . Deletion of the coiled - coil domain or the WD repeat domain decreased actin filament binding by at least 200 and 1500 fold , respectively , and completely eliminated activation , indicating that actin filament binding is required for activation . Mutants with reduced ( or no ) binding to Arp2 / 3 ( Crn1 - WD - CC and Crn1 - ALEE - AKK ) failed to recruit or activate the 5 by gu e s t on N ov e m b e r 17 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m complex , so direct binding to both Arp2 / 3 complex and actin filaments is required . Therefore , these data are consistent with a tethering recruitment activation model , in which Crn1 simultaneously binds an actin filament and Arp2 / 3 complex . The low binding affinity and unusually slow on rate of Arp2 / 3 complex for filaments suggests that recruitment is a plausible mechanism ( 3 , 38 ) . The tethering recruitment model predicts simultaneous interaction of Arp2 / 3 complex with Crn1 and Las17 . While this is supported by our anisotropy and crosslinking data , we cannot rule out the possibility that Crn1 and Las17 interact sequentially to activate the complex . This remains an open question for both Crn1 and cortactin , and will require further study ( 6 , 46 ) . The stoichiometry of Crn1 to Arp2 / 3 complex on filaments also remains an open question . The data in Figure 3B show that in the absence of Crn1 , ~ 1 molecule of Arp2 / 3 complex is bound per 10 actin subunits in a filament . Addition of coronin results in maximal recruitment of one additional complex when ~ 0 . 83 coronin trimers ( or 2 . 5 Crn1 monomers ) are bound per 10 actin subunits . While this suggests that on average one coronin trimer recruits slightly more than one complex , further experiments will be required to unequivocally determine the stoichiometry . Indirect inhibition explains the dual modes of regulation observed for Crn1 - Our data showed a dramatic concentration - dependence in the effect of Crn1 on Arp2 / 3 complex activity . Activation was maximal at about 100 nM and decreased at higher concentrations . Low micromolar concentrations completely inhibited the complex , as previously observed ( 18 ) . Humphries , et . al . reported that a construct of Crn1 containing both the unique and coiled - coil regions is sufficient to bind and inhibit Arp2 / 3 complex ( 18 ) . This led to the proposal of a direct inhibition model , in which binding of the UCC region locks Arp2 / 3 complex into an inactive conformation ( 18 , 32 ) . Our competition binding assay showed that deletion of the unique region abolished binding between Crn1 and Arp2 / 3 complex , but this construct , Crn1 - WD - CC strongly inhibited the complex , arguing against direct inhibition as the main mode of down regulation . In addition , we show that mutations that reduced or eliminated actin filament binding ( Crn1 - WDU , Crn1 - UCC ) caused drastic reductions in inhibition ( Fig . 2B , Fig . S3 ) , and that high concentrations of Crn1 reduce Arp2 / 3 binding to actin filaments ( Fig . 3B ) . Therefore , we propose an alternative mechanism in which coronin inhibits nucleation by saturating actin filaments and blocking Arp2 / 3 complex binding sites ( Fig . 6 ) . The three - dimensional reconstruction of coronin - saturated F - actin is consistent with this mechanism because it shows that Arp2 / 3 complex and coronin binding sites on F - actin overlap ( 27 , 47 ) ( Fig . S4 ) . In addition , previous experiments showed that inhibition was relieved by adding preformed filaments ( 18 ) , which we propose is due to the presence of free side binding sites on the added filaments . We note that in our assays , 4 . 0 µM Crn1 or Crn1 - foldon was sufficient to completely inhibit Arp2 / 3 complex , but did not completely block copelleting of the complex with actin filaments ( Fig . 3B ) . In contrast , 4 . 0 µM Crn1 - WD - CC or Crn1 - ALEE - AKK , constructs with impaired Arp2 / 3 binding , strongly blocked copelleting of the complex at 4 . 0 µM . These data suggest that Crn1 constructs that bind Arp2 / 3 can tether the complex to actin filaments even when they are saturated with Crn1 , and are consistent with a tethering recruitment mechanism of activation . An indirect mechanism of inhibition explains the observed switch between activating and inhibiting modes of coronin . We propose that the switch is controlled by the ability of Crn1 to either recruit Arp2 / 3 to filaments or block filament binding sites for the complex . At low Crn1 concentrations , side binding sites adjacent to the bound coronin are free , and the complex can be recruited to these sites , increasing the apparent binding affinity of the complex for filaments ( Fig . 6 ) . At high Crn1 concentrations , Arp2 / 3 complex binding sites are blocked so nucleation is inhibited . We note that three other actin binding proteins , caldesmon , EPLIN and tropomyosin ( 10 , 48 , 49 ) , have been shown to inhibit nucleation by blocking filament binding sites . Understanding how these proteins contribute to the architecture of actin networks in vivo is an important challenge in the field . Regulation of Arp2 / 3 complex by coronin in vivo - We showed that activation of Arp2 / 3 complex by Crn1 is important for proper actin patch dynamics in budding yeast , and our data supports a model in which Crn1 activates the complex by recruiting it to the sides of filaments . 6 by gu e s t on N ov e m b e r 17 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m These observations are consistent with mathematical modeling of actin patch assembly in fission yeast , which demonstrated that Arp2 / 3 complex must bind to the sides of actin filaments faster in vivo than observed in vitro to account for the rate of patch assembly ( 33 , 50 ) . Therefore , type II NPFs like Crn1 may play a general role in accelerating Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated branching in actin patch assembly . Of the six known activators of Arp2 / 3 complex in budding yeast ( Las17 , Abp1 , Myo3 and Myo5 , Pan1 and Crn1 ) , only Las17 is a prototypical type I NPF with an actin monomer recruiting V region ( 51 ) . Understanding how these regulators coordinate to control Arp2 / 3 complex activity in vivo will provide valuable insight into Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin assembly in actin patches and other branched actin networks . Our in vitro data show that the role of Crn1 in regulating Arp2 / 3 complex switches depending on its concentration . In endocytic patches , Crn1 reaches an average peak concentration of 93 molecules in budding yeast and 400 - 500 molecules in fission yeast , compared to 5000 – 7000 molecules of actin ( 19 , 33 ) . Crn1 recruitment is delayed compared to actin , and its concentration peaks about 4 seconds later than the core actin module ( 19 , 33 ) . Therefore , Crn1 is present at low concentrations during patch assembly , consistent with our proposed activation mechanism . At peak concentrations , budding yeast actin patches contain an average of 5100 molecules of actin , greater than 50 times the amount of Crn1 at its peak ( 19 ) . This suggests that Crn1 on its own does not saturate filaments to the extent required to block binding of the complex during actin patch lifetimes . However , we cannot rule out cooperation of Crn1 with other actin filament binding proteins to inhibit branching nucleation . While this leaves open the question of a role for Crn1 inhibition of Arp2 / 3 complex in yeast actin patches , other actin filament networks appear to require inhibition of Arp2 / 3 complex by coronin for proper dynamics ( 7 ) . Implications for understanding other coronin family proteins - We examined other coronin sequences to determine if activation of Arp2 / 3 complex is unique to budding yeast Crn1 or a general feature of coronin family proteins . Humans have seven coronins , divided into three classes ( 52 ) . Class 1 and class 2 coronins ( Coro1A - 1C , Coro6 , Coro2A - B ) have the same domain organization as Crn1 , whereas the sole member of third class , Coro7 / Pod - 1 has two WD repeat domains and no predicted coiled coil . We did not find a CA sequence in any of the class 1 or class 2 coronins , making it unlikely that that they activate Arp2 / 3 complex . However , we and others have noted the presence of an acidic region conserved among diverse species in the C - terminus of Coro7 ( 52 ) . Our analysis suggests that Coro7 proteins also have a C sequence N - terminal to the acidic region ( Fig . 2C ) . Therefore , Coro7 / Pod - 1 proteins may be functionally similar to budding yeast Crn1 . Interestingly , like budding yeast Crn1 , Coro1B interacts directly with both actin filaments and Arp2 / 3 complex ( 9 ) . However , instead of activating the complex , Coro1B has been reported to target Arp2 / 3 complex at existing branch junctions to disassemble the branch ( 23 ) . In addition , multiple labs have shown that some coronins play a role in regulating the disassembly of actin filaments through the actin depolymerization factor cofilin ( 17 , 19 , 53 ) . Clearly , additional in vitro and in vivo experiments are required to understand the molecular basis of actin cytoskeletal regulation by different classes of coronins . ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS .

Proposed mechanism for dual modes of regulation of Arp2 / 3 complex by Crn1 . Coronin trimers ( cyan ) bind actin filaments ( grey surface representation ) through their WD repeat domains and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Arp3 - dark grey , Arp2 , light grey , other subunits are white ) through the unique region CA . The unique CA interacts with Arp2 , leaving a second activator binding site on Arp3 open for VCA - containing NPF . Synergistic activation may occur through simultaneous recruitment of the complex to filaments and actin monomers to the complex . Table 1 .
