European Journal of Medical Research Membrane tension - mediated stiff and soft tumor subtypes closely associated with prognosis for prostate cancer patients Dechao Feng 1 * † , Jie Wang 1† , Xu Shi 1 , Dengxiong Li 1 , Wuran Wei 1 and Ping Han 1 * Abstract Background Prostate cancer ( PCa ) is usually considered as cold tumor . Malignancy is associated with cell mechanic changes that contribute to extensive cell deformation required for metastatic dissemination . Thus , we established stiff and soft tumor subtypes for PCa patients from perspective of membrane tension . Methods Nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm was used to identify molecular subtypes . We completed analy - ses using software R 3 . 6 . 3 and its suitable packages . Results We constructed stiff and soft tumor subtypes using eight membrane tension - related genes through lasso regression and nonnegative matrix factorization analyses . We found that patients in stiff subtype were more prone to biochemical recurrence than those in soft subtype ( HR 16 . 18 ; p < 0 . 001 ) , which was externally validated in other three cohorts . The top ten mutation genes between stiff and soft subtypes were DNAH , NYNRIN , PTCHD4 , WNK1 , ARFGEF1 , HRAS , ARHGEF2 , MYOM1 , ITGB6 and CPS1 . E2F targets , base excision repair and notch signaling pathway were highly enriched in stiff subtype . Stiff subtype had significantly higher TMB and T cells follicular helper levels than soft sub - type , as well as CTLA4 , CD276 , CD47 and TNFRSF25 . Conclusions From the perspective of cell membrane tension , we found that stiff and soft tumor subtypes were closely associated with BCR - free survival for PCa patients , which might be important for the future research in the field of PCa . Keywords Prostate cancer , Biochemical recurrence , Membrane tension , Nonnegative matrix factorization Introduction Many human cancers are closely related to age , especially for urinary tumors [ 1 – 4 ] . Prostate cancer ( PCa ) is one of the most frequent malignancies in men , which harbors great prevalence in aging males [ 1 , 5 , 6 ] . This phenome - non is exacerbating as the global population ages and the disease burden of this disease is predicted to be increased [ 1 , 5 , 7 – 11 ] . Standard therapies for clinically localized PCa mainly contain radical prostatectomy ( RP ) and radi - cal radiotherapy ( RT ) [ 5 , 12 – 14 ] . Unfortunately , a con - siderable number of patients will develop biochemical recurrence ( BCR ) despite radical treatments [ 15 ] . BCR means the return of measurable PSA , which is associated with high possibility of clinical recurrence , leading to the elevated risks of metastasis and death [ 6 , 13 , 14 , 16 – 19 ] . Currently , the recommended management method for BCR by European Association of Urology is mainly based on prostate - specific antigen doubling time ( PSA - DT ) , † Dechao Feng and Jie Wang contributed equally to this work * Correspondence : Dechao Feng fdcfenix @ stu . scu . edu . cn Ping Han hanping @ scu . edu . cn 1 Department of Urology , Institute of Urology , West China Hospital , Sichuan University , Guoxue Xiang # 37 , Chengdu 610041 , Sichuan , People’s Republic of China Page 2 of 11 Feng et al . European Journal of Medical Research ( 2023 ) 28 : 172 Gleason score , International Society of Urological Pathology ( ISUP ) grade and interval from primary ther - apy to biochemical failure [ 15 ] , but there are still defects in the process of clinical application . With the advent of next - generation sequencing , more and more biomark - ers for the management of BCR based on transcriptomic data are identified from different perspectives [ 8 , 12 , 14 , 20 – 22 ] . Interestingly , radiomics attracts clinicians’ atten - tion in PCa , such as prostate volume and other traits [ 23 , 24 ] . However , investigators have not yet considered BCR in PCa from the perspective of membrane tension . Membrane tension is not a new concept , which refers to the force per unit length acting on a cross - section of membrane , regulating many vital biological processes [ 25 ] . Over the past decades , the important role of cell and tissue mechanics in tumorigenesis , progression and metastasis was gradually recognized [ 26 – 29 ] . The decreasing membrane tension of tumor cells is associated with increasing invasion and metastatic capacity , which is proved to be mediated by the Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs ( BAR ) family proteins [ 30 ] . In contrast , in normal epithe - lial cells , the underlying mechanism for the homeostatic maintenance of the higher plasma membrane tension is achieved through the membrane - to - cortical attach - ment regulated by the ezrin , radixin , and moesin ( ERM ) proteins . If this homeostasis is disrupted , epithelial cells may transform into mesenchymal migratory phenotype powered by BAR proteins , leading to greater capacity for invasion and metastasis [ 30 , 31 ] . In addition , tumor cells can also feel the changes in exogenous forces through a complex series of cellular sensing and signaling pathway conduction mechanisms , which can affect and regu - late the cellular metabolic processes , and then promote the tumor proliferation and progression [ 28 , 32 – 34 ] . Therefore , to better reveal the role and mechanism of membrane tension in the progress of tumorigenesis , pro - gression , and metastasis in PCa , we divided PCa patients into 2 subtypes and proposed the concepts of stiff tumor and soft tumor based on 8 identified membrane tension - related genes and the cancer genome atlas ( TCGA ) data - base , which provided new perspective and insights for the management of the prognosis and survival of PCa patients . Methods Data preparation and identification of molecular subtypes The workflow of our study is illustrated in Fig . 1 . We downloaded the gene matrix and clinical data of PCa patients in the TCGA database as the training set from our previous study [ 20 ] . For the validation set , we used 2 gene expression omnibus ( GEO ) datasets ( GSE46602 [ 35 ] , GSE116918 [ 36 ] ) and MSKCC2010 [ 37 ] ( http : / / www . cbiop ortal . org / ) . Moreover , we obtained total 44 membrane - related genes from previously published lit - erature [ 38 ] . Subsequently , we performed differential analysis between tumor tissue and normal tissue within the TCGA cohort based on R package “limma” . Defer - entially expressed genes ( DEGs ) were defined as llog - FCl ≥ 0 . 4 and p . adj . < 0 . 05 . After the intersection of DEGs and membrane - related genes , we used Lasso regression to identify the final genes . Based these genes , we used nonnegative matrix factorization ( NMF ) method to divide the patients in TCGA cohorts into two subtypes . We set the cluster number of K index from 2 to 10 and determined the average contour width of the common member matrix using the R package “NMF” . Three exter - nal cohorts were used to validate the prognostic value of TCGA subtypes , including GSE46602 [ 35 ] , GSE116918 [ 36 ] and MSKCC2010 [ 37 ] . The clinical features between these two subtypes were analyzed . Mutation landscape and gene set enrichment analysis ( GSEA ) We downloaded RNA - sequencing profiles , genetic muta - tion and corresponding clinical information of PCa patients from TCGA database ( https : / / portal . gdc . com ) . The data of mutations were obtained and visualized based on R package “maftools” . We also conducted the differences analysis of mutation frequency between these two subtypes . When performing GSEA analysis by GSEA software ( version 3 . 0 ) ( http : / / www . gsea - msigdb . org ) , [ 39 ] several gene set databases were used including : “c2 . cp . kegg . v7 . 4 . symbols . gmt” and “h . all . v7 . 4 . symbols . gmt” from the molecular signatures database [ 39 , 40 ] . The minimum gene set was defined as 5 and the maximum gene set was 5000 . Resampling was performed as 1000 times . P value < 0 . 05 and false discovery rate < 0 . 05 were considered statistically significant . Tumor stemness , tumor heterogeneity and tumor immune microenvironment ( TIME ) analysis For tumor stemness indexes , we compared differentially methylated probes - based stemness scores ( DMPss ) , DNA methylation - based stemness scores ( DNAss ) , enhancer elements / DNA methylation - based stemness scores ( ENHss ) , epigenetically regulated DNA methylation - based stemness scores ( EREG - METHss ) , epigenetically regulated RNA expression - based stemness scores ( EREG . EXPss ) , RNA expression - based stemness scores ( RNAss ) [ 41 ] and mRNAsi [ 42 ] algorithms between two subtypes . For tumor heterogeneity , we compared homologous recombination deficiency ( HRD ) , loss of heterozygosity ( LOH ) , neoantigen ( NEO ) , tumor ploidy , tumor purity , mutant - allele tumor heterogeneity ( MATH ) , tumor mutation burden ( TMB ) and microsatellite instability ( MSI ) [ 43 , 44 ] between two subtypes . All these data could Page 3 of 11 Feng et al . European Journal of Medical Research ( 2023 ) 28 : 172 be obtained from our previous study [ 9 ] . In addition , for the TIME analysis , we used Cibersortx and ESTIMATE algorithms [ 45 – 47 ] to assess the overall tumor microen - vironment and immune components and compared the differences of tumor microenvironment scores and 54 immune checkpoints between these two subtype . Moreo - ver , we calculated the Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion ( TIDE ) score to predict potential response of immune checkpoint blockade ( ICB ) therapy [ 48 ] and compared the differences between these two subtypes . All the comparison of differences between these two sub - types were based on the Wilcokson rank sum test . Statistical analysis All analyses were completed through software R 3 . 6 . 3 and its suitable packages . For abnormal distribution , we used Wilcoxon test to compare differences between groups . Survival analysis was conducted through log - rank test and presented as Kaplan – Meier curve . Statistical sig - nificance was set as two - sided p < 0 . 05 . Significant marks were as follows : not significance ( ns ) , p ≥ 0 . 05 ; * , p < 0 . 05 ; * * , p < 0 . 01 ; * * * , p < 0 . 001 . Results The identification of “stiff tumor” and “soft tumor” The PCa expression profile in the TCGA database included 498 tumor samples and 52 normal samples . The DEGs between tumor samples and normal samples were detected using R package “limma” and finally 4895 genes were obtained to analyze ( Fig . 2A ) . Then , after the intersection of DEGs and membrane - related genes , 16 candidate genes were obtained ( Fig . 2A ) . Through Lasso regression , when lambda ( λ ) equaled 4 . 7 e − 3 , we obtained the optimal model ( Fig . 2B ) and 8 identified genes , including FNBP1 , PICK1 , FGFR1 , MSN , TIMP1 , BAIAP2 , EGF and FLNA ( Fig . 2C ) . Based on these 8 membrane - mediated genes , using NMF algorithm , we divided 430 PCa patients in TCGA cohort into 2 sub - types and named them “stiff tumor” and “soft tumor” based on their biological meanings ( Fig . 2D ) . Similar Fig . 1 The flowchart of this study Page 4 of 11 Feng et al . European Journal of Medical Research ( 2023 ) 28 : 172 results were observed in MSKCC2010 , GSE116918 and GSE46602 cohorts ( Fig . 2E - G ) . We found the BCR risk of “stiff tumor” was significantly higher than “soft tumor” ( HR = 16 . 18 ; Fig . 2H ) . The baseline comparison showed balanced clinical features between “stiff tumor” and “soft tumor” ( Table 1 ) . Similar prognostic results were observed in MSKCC2010 , GSE116918 and GSE46602 cohorts ( Fig . 2I - K ) . For the differences of mutation land - scape between “stiff tumor” and “soft tumor” , the top ten genes were DNAH9 , NYNRIN , PTCHD4 , WNK1 , ARF - GEF1 , HRAS , ARHGEF2 , MYOM1 , ITGB6 and CPS1 ( Fig . 3A ) . Functional enrichment analysis , TME evaluation and tumor heterogeneity and stemness For GSEA , protein secretion was highly enriched in “soft tumor” ( Fig . 3B ) and E2F targets , base excision repair and notch signaling pathway were highly enriched in “stiff tumor” ( Fig . 3B - C ) . For tumor heterogeneity between “stiff tumor” and “soft tumor” , we found TMB in “stiff tumor” was higher than “soft tumor” with statistical sig - nificance ( Fig . 3D ) . In terms of immune checkpoints , the expressions of CTLA4 , CD276 , CD47 and TNFRSF25 were significantly higher in “stiff tumor” ( Fig . 3E ) . In addition , T cells follicular helper were significantly higher in “stiff tumor” than in “soft tumor” ( Fig . 3E ) . Discussion The metastasis of malignant cells is usually accompanied by alternation of cell mechanical properties . A line of evi - dence has shown that tumor cells can promote metasta - sis and change cell metabolism by reducing membrane tension [ 28 , 30 , 32 – 34 ] . However , PCa appears to deviate from the cell - softening trends described in other cancer models , in which with the increasing of stiffness of PCa cells , the metastasis potential is also increasing [ 49 – 53 ] . In addition , a recent study found that the cell and tissue mechanic characteristics of different metastatic potential cells were diverse , which meant the relationship between the metastatic ability and membrane tension and tis - sue stiffness of PCa cells was not necessarily linear [ 54 ] . These confounding results indicate that microenviron - ment mechanics are a significant yet nuanced factor in the progression of PCa . Based on these facts and by means of analyzing published sequencing data , we identi - fied 8 membrane - related genes ( FNBP1 , PICK1 , FGFR1 , MSN , TIMP1 , BAIAP2 , EGF and FLNA ) and used NMF algorithm to divide PCa patients in TCGA cohort into two subtypes based on these genes . In PCa , there are many reports on FGFR1 , TIMP1 , and EGF . For instance , FGFR1 is a kind of fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) / FGF receptor , which was over - expressed in PCa [ 55 , 56 ] . Enhanced FGF signaling plays an important role in tumor progression and drug resistance , which can induce angiogenesis , epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) , and upregulation of AR [ 57 – 59 ] . In addition , a recent study indicated that TIMP1 was a significant molecular switch that could determine the effects of senescence in PCa [ 60 ] . TIMP1 belongs to the TIMP gene family and encodes natural inhibitors of the matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) , which involves in degradation of the extracel - lular matrix ( ECM ) [ 61 ] . The degradation of ECM plays a wide range of physiological function in angiogenesis , cell repair and remodeling of tissues , while the defi - ciency of TIMP1 will break the balance between TIMP and MMPs , resulting in the abnormity of angiogenesis , cell proliferation , and apoptosis [ 61 , 62 ] . In PCa , the loss of TIMP1 can change the senescence - associated secretory phenotype ( SASP ) of senescent tumor cells through activation of MMPs , thus promoting tumor metastasis [ 60 ] . Moreover , EGF is a significant regu - latory factor that can induce EMT through increas - ing expression of transcription factors responsible for reducing E - cadherin and promoting cancer invasion [ 63 ] . In summary , the function and role of these three genes in PCa are relatively established . There are a few reports on FNBP1 , PICK1 , MSN , BAIAP2 , and FLNA in PCa . FNBP1 ( formin - binding protein 1 / 17 ) is an actin skeleton - related protein , which is a member of F - Bar / EFC family . Several researches showed that FNBP1 could affect tumor migration and invasion through affecting the formation of filopodia in bladder cancer [ 64 ] and breast cancer cells [ 65 ] . In addition , a recent study found the loss of FNBP1 could result in the loss of invasive ability in gastric cancer [ 66 ] . Remarkably , a pan - cancer analysis based on bioinformatics found that except the metastatic cancer , low expression of FNBP1 ( See figure on next page . ) Fig . 2 The identification of “stiff tumor” and “soft tumor” .

European Journal of Medical Research ( 2023 ) 28 : 172 was associated with worse prognosis in breast cancer and lung adenocarcinoma , while high expression of FNBP1 was related to the poor prognosis in stomach adenocarcinoma [ 67 ] . These studies showed the expres - sion patterns of FNBP1 were associated with the type of tumor and FNBP1 played an important yet complex Fig . 2 ( See legend on previous page . ) Page 6 of 11 Feng et al . European Journal of Medical Research ( 2023 ) 28 : 172 role of in cancer invasion and metastasis . For PICK1 , current understanding of its role in tumor is still lim - ited . PICK1 was reported to involve in regulating the cell to cell junction in epithelial cells , which was associ - ated with tumor invasion and metastasis [ 68 ] . In PCa , Dai et al . found the overexpression of PICK1 could suppress the migration and invasion in vitro and bone metastasis in vivo [ 69 ] . MSN encodes moesin protein , which belongs to ERM family and appears to func - tion as link protein between plasma membranes and actin - based cytoskeletons [ 70 ] . Additionally , Moesin plays a key role in the control of cell morphology , adhesion , and motility [ 70 – 72 ] . The abnormalities of moesin , such as mislocalization , have been proved to be associated with tumor progression in multiple types of tumor [ 72 – 74 ] . Furthermore , moesin plays an impor - tant role in the EMT process of breast cancer cells and pancreatic cancer cells , and is currently shown to serve as a potential EMT marker for breast cancer and pancreatic cancer [ 75 – 77 ] . These results presented the huge potential for MSN in cancer research . BAIAP2 and FLNA are rarely reported in cancer . BAIAP2 is also called IRSp53 . A bioinformatic study constructed a prognostic model in esophagus squamous cell carci - noma including BAIAP2 [ 78 ] . In addition , Funato et al . [ 79 ] found IRSp53 could bind to EPs8 to form a com - plex , thus enhancing the invasive ability of cancer cells . For FLNA , a study reported that FLNA could directly regulate the metastasis and EMT of chemoresistance colorectal cancer cells [ 80 ] . Another study found that in bladder cancer , hexavalent chromium could regulate the expression of FLNA to mediate EMT to promote the proliferation and migration and inhibit the apopto - sis of bladder cancer cells . In summary , a series of evi - dence suggests that the 8 identified genes are associated with tumor metastasis and invasion . Based on the evi - dences and unique biological functions and meanings of these genes , we named the subtype with bad progno - sis as “stiff tumor” and the subtype with relatively good prognosis as “soft tumor” . We found “stiff tumor” had a much worse prognosis than “soft tumor” and speculated it is associated with the differences in enriched pathways between the two sub - types . E2F targets , base excision repair and notch signal - ing pathway were highly enriched in “stiff tumor” while protein secretion was highly enriched in “soft tumor” . The enrichment of E2F targets in “stiff tumor” means “stiff tumor” cells may have stronger ability of prolifera - tion , because E2F is the key transcription factor for regu - lating of cell cycle . It is well known that the disorder of cell cycle is one of the important features of cancer cells [ 81 ] . Shorter cell cycle implies a faster proliferation rate , correlating with bad prognosis . In addition , a series of evidence suggests the increased expression of base exci - sion repair related genes was associated with rapid recur - rence , metastatic dissemination , and decreased patient survival in PCa [ 82 – 85 ] , which is consistent with our Table 1 The clinical features between TCGA stiff and soft tumor subtypes for prostate cancer patients IQR interquartile range Characteristic Soft tumor Stiff tumor P value Samples 354 76 Age , median ( IQR ) 61 ( 56 , 66 ) 62 ( 57 , 66 ) 0 . 526 Gleason score , n ( % ) 0 . 297 6 32 ( 7 . 4 % ) 7 ( 1 . 6 % ) 7 175 ( 40 . 7 % ) 31 ( 7 . 2 % ) 8 50 ( 11 . 6 % ) 9 ( 2 . 1 % ) 9 97 ( 22 . 6 % ) 29 ( 6 . 7 % ) T stage , n ( % ) 1 . 000 T2 128 ( 30 . 2 % ) 27 ( 6 . 4 % ) T3 214 ( 50 . 5 % ) 47 ( 11 . 1 % ) T4 7 ( 1 . 7 % ) 1 ( 0 . 2 % ) Race , n ( % ) 0 . 317 Asian 9 ( 2 . 2 % ) 2 ( 0 . 5 % ) Black or African American 45 ( 10 . 8 % ) 5 ( 1 . 2 % ) White 288 ( 69 . 2 % ) 67 ( 16 . 1 % ) N stage , n ( % ) 1 . 000 N0 251 ( 66 . 9 % ) 55 ( 14 . 7 % ) N1 57 ( 15 . 2 % ) 12 ( 3 . 2 % ) Residual tumor , n ( % ) 0 . 465 No 228 ( 54 . 4 % ) 45 ( 10 . 7 % ) Yes 117 ( 27 . 9 % ) 29 ( 6 . 9 % ) Fig . 3 Functional pathways , mutation genes , tumor heterogeneity , tumor stemness and TME evaluation between two subtypes .

Moreover , a study showed natamycin which was an inhibitor of key BER enzymes DNA polymerase β and DNA Ligase I could significantly inhibit the proliferation of PCa cells in the androgen depleted environment , which furthermore proved that BER signaling pathway played an important role in the bad prognosis in “stiff tumor” [ 83 ] . Importantly , we also observed notch signaling path - way enriched in “stiff tumor” . In the physiological state , notch signaling pathway has important role in regulating proliferation , differentiation , cell - fate determination and self - renewal of stem and progenitor cell [ 86 – 88 ] . In the pathological state , the deregulation of notch signaling pathway has been demonstrated in a variety of tumors containing PCa and is associated with tumorigenesis and progression [ 89 – 93 ] . These results strongly support our findings . Interestingly , we found protein secretion was mainly enriched in “soft tumor” . We speculated this may be due to the upregulation of androgen signaling . A study reported compared with hormone - naïve metastatic PCa , hormone - refractory metastatic PCa showed a decrease of androgen signaling and protein biosynthesis [ 94 ] . Therefore , we speculated that the higher level of andro - gen signaling was associated with higher level of protein synthesis and lower malignancy of PCa cells , which was consistent with better prognosis of “soft tumor” . For tumor heterogeneity , we observed TMB in “stiff tumor” was higher than “soft tumor” . TMB refers to the total number of mutations present in a single tumor spec - imen , which can be used to reflect immunogenic neoan - tigens [ 95 ] . In many kinds of tumors , higher TMB means tumor cells carry more tumor antigens , which therefore are more vulnerable to be killed by activated immune cells [ 95 , 96 ] . In PCa , there was a study showing high level of TMB was significantly associated with poor BCR - free survival [ 97 ] , which was in agreement with our results . In addition , we compared significant immune checkpoints between “stiff tumor” and “soft tumor” and observed the expression of CTLA4 , CD276 and TNFRSF25 was higher in “stiff tumor” , while the expression of CD47 was higher in “soft tumor” . CTLA4 is an important inhibitory recep - tor mainly expressed on T cells , which plays important role in immunosuppression of tumors [ 98 ] . Some stud - ies found high expression of CTLA4 was associated with worse prognosis in different kinds of tumors , including PCa [ 99 – 102 ] . CD276 is a newly found molecule in B7 family and probably serves as potential target for multi - ple kinds of tumors [ 103 ] . In PCa , several studies proved that the overexpression of CD276 was associated with bad clinical outcomes in localized PCa [ 104 – 107 ] . In addition , another study found that compared with local - ized cancer , high expression of CD276 was more fre - quently observed in metastatic cancer and associated with high disease - specific mortality [ 108 ] . These results might explain why “stiff tumor” had worse prognosis to some extent . There is no doubting that intratumor genetic variability causes sampling bias in gene expression profiles . Further - more , the microenvironment characteristics may differ in different tumor regions , such as the tumor core and inva - sive margin . More importantly , whether the identified subtypes in this study could be used in clinical practice in a real - world setting still take a long time . Conclusions In this study , based on 8 membrane tension - mediated genes and their unique biological function , we obtained “stiff tumor” and “soft tumor” subtypes , which provided references and insights to the potential mechanism of invasion and metastasis in PCa and precision medicine .
