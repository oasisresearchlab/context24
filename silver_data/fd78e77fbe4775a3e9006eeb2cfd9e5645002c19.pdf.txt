Method : Chinese nation - wide on - line cross - sectional survey on university students , collected between February 12 th and 17 th , 2020 . Primary outcome was prevalence of clinically - relevant posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms . Secondary outcomes on poor mental health included prevalence of clinically - relevant anxiety and depressive symptoms , while posttraumatic growth was considered as indicator of effective coping reaction . Results : Of 2 , 500 invited Chinese university students , 2 , 038 completed the survey . Prevalence of clinically - relevant PTSD , anxiety , and depressive symptoms , and post traumatic growth ( PTG ) was 30 . 8 , 15 . 5 , 23 . 3 , and 66 . 9 % respectively . Older age , knowing people who had been isolated , more ACEs , higher level of anxious attachment , and lower level of resilience all predicted primary outcome ( all p < 0 . 01 ) . Conclusions : A signi ﬁ cant proportion of young adults exhibit clinically relevant posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , anxious or depressive symptoms , but a larger portion of individuals showed to effectively cope with COVID - 19 pandemic . Interventions promoting resilience should be provided , even remotely , to those subjects with speci ﬁ c risk factors to develop poor mental health during COVID - 19 or other pandemics with social isolation .

The total number of con ﬁ rmed cases and deaths worldwide rapidly exceeded those from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) in 2003 ( 3 ) , and in March 2020 the World Health Organization declared COVID - 19 a pandemic . Such results may directly affect the mental health of people ( 4 ) . Although researchers worldwide race with unprecedented efforts to develop a vaccine against COVID - 19 , this may not be available soon enough to control the pandemic . Hence , restrictions on social contact ( large - scale lock - down ) and appropriate infection prevention strategies ( travel limitation , quarantine , and self - isolation ) have been implemented in order to prevent the spread of the virus ( 4 ) . Together with the strong person - to - person transmission capability of the virus , the strain that COVID - 19 poses on public health and the implemented restrictions may have detrimental effects on mental health , including overwhelming fear and anxiety ( 5 – 7 ) . Several individual factors can modulate mental health outcomes in reaction to such a stressful event ( 4 ) . Thus , a timely evaluation of the detrimental effects of COVID - 19 pandemic on mental health may inform mental health policies . In general , a group of college students is of particular interest to researchers as they experience multifaceted pressures such as academic workload , economic dif ﬁ culties , and interpersonal relationship . These stressful experiences may put college students at high risk of future mental health problems ( e . g . , depression and anxiety ) . For example , a meta - analytical review ( including 32 , 694 Chinese college students ) indicated the overall prevalence of depression among this age group is 23 . 8 % ( 95 % CI : 19 . 9 – 28 . 5 % ) . Recently , a survey conducted in Eastern China found that 21 . 4 % of 1 , 931 college students reported having symptoms of anxiety . Besides the two common negative emotions , posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) symptoms were also reported with 16 . 6 % of 1 , 081 college students ( 8 , 9 ) . In addition , young college students typically exhibit a higher frequency of inter - individual contacts , and therefore social distancing measures ( travel restrictions , quarantine , and self - isolation ) during the COVID - 19 pandemic may have a more profound impact on their daily life ( 10 ) . Furthermore , excessive lack of or incorrect sensationalistic information by the mass media , fear of infection , witnessing death and suffering of the general population in the media , personal experiences of bereavement without the possibility to assist relatives or signi ﬁ cant others , the impossibility to ritualize the loss with a funeral are all risk factors to develop poor mental health , beyond social isolation ( 11 ) . According to previous studies ( 12 , 13 ) , psychological reactions to stressful and life - threatening situations differ considerably between individuals and depend upon personal ( e . g . , age , adverse childhood experience , attachment style , resilience ) and social ( e . g . socioeconomic status , family structure ) factors . In addition to these traditional factors , the threat imminence ( knowing people who had been isolated and the number of currently con ﬁ rmed cases within their province in the present survey ) and public understanding of health - related information approaches and prescriptions may be correlated with negative emotions during the COVID - 19 pandemic . For example , during the COVID - 19 pandemic , if someone they know was quarantined or infected , it may directly make them feel unsafe or insecure , ultimately resulting in negative emotions ( 14 , 15 ) . Therefore , the aim of the present study was to focus on young adults ( university students ) and to determine the prevalence of several clinically - relevant mental health outcomes ( PTSD , anxiety , depression , and posttraumatic growth ) and identify potential risk factors during the COVID - 19 pandemic in Chinese university students . The study might help health - care providers and communities better prepare for their response to this and similar public health emergencies . METHODS Study Participants Data for the present study were collected on 12 – 17 February 2020 , namely , around one month after the coronavirus disease ( COVID - 19 ) outbreak . Participants were recruited from more than 180 universities in China , covering a wide range of disciplines , including science , engineering , education , law , and literature . When the students participated in the survey , their locations were distributed across 29 provinces and cities of China . Prior to ﬁ lling out several self - reported questionnaires , all volunteers had signed the online consent forms . In total , 2 , 126 students initially participated in the survey ; after the exclusion of 88 individuals with missing response and incomplete responses , data on 2 , 038 students remained for analysis ( 95 . 9 % ) . Procedure The survey was conducted online for both convenience and safety reasons in light of the COVID - 19 outbreak . Over a period of 6 days , students were invited to participate in the survey via Tencent ’ s QQ , WeChat , Weibo , and college - related websites ( such as university association websites and bulletin board system forums ) . Participants who had completed all questionnaires that took around 15 min were given ten RMB via online payment ( equivalent to 1 . 5 U . S . dollars at the current rate ) . Recruitment and data collection procedures were approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee ( No : 2020005 ) of Shenzhen University . Measurement Dependent Variables Zung Self - Rating Anxiety Scale ( Z - SAS ) Symptoms of anxiety were assessed using the Z - SAS ( 16 ) , a 20 - item self - report questionnaire . The Z - SAS includes measures of state and trait anxiety based on scoring in four groups of manifestations : cognitive , autonomic , motor , and central nervous system symptoms . Responses to each item range from 1 ( a little of the time ) to 4 ( most of the time ) with higher scores indicating increased levels of anxiety . Standard scores above 50 ( including 50 ) as a cut - off point suggest clinically signi ﬁ cant anxiety ( 17 , 18 ) . Chi et al . COVID - 19 on Mental Health Frontiers in Psychiatry | www . frontiersin . org August 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 803 2 Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ - 9 ) PHQ - 9 was adopted to assess participants ’ symptoms of depression during the last 7 days . The PHQ - 9 uses the DSM - IV diagnostic criteria to assess depressive symptomatology ( i . e . , sleep , concentration , and energy problems , low self - esteem , anhedonia , etc . ) on a 4 - point scale ranging from 0 ( not at all ) to 3 ( nearly every day ) ( 19 , 20 ) . Individuals with the PHQ - 9 scores of 10 or above were classi ﬁ ed as having depressive symptoms ( 21 , 22 ) . In addition to its utility as a short screener , the PHQ - 9 also captures depression severity . Overall scale scores are computed as a sum of the nine items , with the higher scores indicating the higher level of depressive symptoms . The Abbreviated PTSD Checklist ( PCL ) PTSD symptoms were assessed using the abbreviated PTSD Checklist ( PCL ) , which has six items corresponding to each symptom ( 23 ) . Responses to each item on the PCL - C were recorded on a 5 - point Likert scale ranging from 1 ( not at all ) to 5 ( extremely ) indicating the degree to which a respondent had experienced a particular symptom over the previous month . The sum of the response scores was calculated , with higher scores indicating a higher level of PTSD symptoms . A cut - off score of 14 and over was used to de ﬁ ne having PTSD symptoms . The PostTraumatic Growth Inventory ( PTGI ) The PIGI was utilized to assess positive self - reported experience of individuals who have experienced traumatic events ( 24 ) . When the original version was adapted to be used in China , psychometric properties were good ( 25 – 27 ) , with the internal consistency reliability of 0 . 95 for the culture - speci ﬁ c inventory and of 0 . 81 – 0 . 88 for four dimensions . The PIGI consists of 21 items across ﬁ ve dimensions , including relationship to others ( seven items ) , new possibilities ( ﬁ ve items ) , personal strength ( four items ) , spiritual change ( two items ) , and appreciation of life ( three items ) . Two previous studies ( 26 , 27 ) had indicated that the dimensions on religious beliefs and spiritual change do not ﬁ t into the Chinese culture . Therefore , we excluded these two items from the questionnaire we used in our study . Participants responded on a 6 - point scale ranging from 0 ( no change ) to 5 ( complete change ) and could obtain a total score ranging from zero to 95 , with higher scores representing higher levels of posttraumatic growth ( PTG ) . Participants who scored above 57 ( include 57 ) were considered to have posttrauma growth ( PTG ) symptoms , as recommended by a previous research ( 27 ) . Independent Variables Sociodemographic Correlates Participants were invited to report on their age , gender ( 0 = male ; 1 = female ) , family structure ( 0 = an intact family ( 1 ) ; 1 = non - intact family ) , their current location ( 1 = Wuhan city ; 2 = Hubei province except for Wuhan ; 3 = Other areas except for Hubei province ) , Further , in order to examine whether risk level response to the COVID - 19 outbreak was related to individuals ’ mental health status , information on whether they knew people who had been isolated for this outbreak ( 0 = yes ; 1 = no ) and the number of con ﬁ rmed cases of COVID - 19 pneumonia ( range from 56 , 249 to 48 ) on the days the respondents completed the questionnaires was obtained from the National Health Commission . Above 1 , 000 ( included 1 , 000 ) con ﬁ rmed patients were coded as 1 and below 1 , 000 were coded as 0 . The Adverse Childhood Experiences ( ACEs ) Questionnaire The ACE was used to assess the adverse experiences of participants in the ﬁ rst 18 years of life ( 28 ) . It contained 29 items within ten aspects : emotional abuse ( two items ; any respond is often or very frequent , coded as 1 ) , physical abuse ( two items ; if the answer of the ﬁ rst item is often or very frequent , or the answer of the second item is sometimes , often , or very frequent , coded as 1 ) , sexual abuse ( four items ; either answer is yes , coded as 1 ) , emotional neglect ( ﬁ ve items ; if the total score of these ﬁ ve questions is > = 15 , coded as 1 ) , physical neglect ( ﬁ ve items ; if the total score of these ﬁ ve questions is > = 10 , coded as 1 ) , domestic violence ( four items ; either answer is sometimes , often or very frequent of the ﬁ rst two relevant questions , or the answer is one or two times , sometimes , often , very often in the last two items , coded as 1 ) , household substance abuse ( two items ; either answer is yes , coded as 1 ) , mental illness in the household ( three items ; either answer is yes , coded as 1 ) , parental separation / divorce ( one item ; if the answer is yes , coded as 1 ) , and criminal household member ( one item ; if the answer is yes , coded as 1 ) . A total score of ACEs questionnaire summarized 10 dimension score and ranged from 0 to 10 , with higher scores representing higher levels . The Adult Attachment Scale ( AAS ) The 18 - item AAS was used to measure adult attachment ( 29 , 30 ) . In this scale , there are three attachment dimensions that are associated with anxiety and avoidance . Speci ﬁ cally , anxiety refers to a person who is worried about being abandoned , unloved , and rejected . Avoidance involves two conditions : ( 1 ) an individual is comfortable with closeness and intimacy ; ( 2 ) an individual feels that people can be relied on to be available when needed . All items were responded using 5 - point scales ( 1 = “ not at all characteristic of me ” and 5 = “ very characteristic of me ” ) . After reversing the related items , a total score of anxious attachment and avoidant attachment subscale ranged from 6 to 30 , and 12 – 60 , respectively , with higher scores indicating higher levels of insecure attachment . The Connor – Davidson Resilience Scale ( CD - RISC ) Resilience was assessed using the Connor – Davidson Resilience Scale , which re ﬂ ects the ability to tolerate experiences related to change , personal problems , illness , pressure , failure , and painful perception ( 31 ) . The original version was adapted by Chinese scholars , with good reliability and validity that were reported ( 32 , 33 ) . This adapted scale consisted of 10 items in which participants needed to respond using a 5 - point Likert scale ( 0 = not true at all and 4 = true nearly all the time ) . The ﬁ nal scores can be obtained by adding up the responses ( value ) of all items ranging from 10 to 50 , with higher total scores indicating higher resilience capacity . The Subjective Socioeconomic Status ( SES ) Scale The widely used subjective SES scale was adopted to assess the subjective social status of participants ( 34 ) . Participants were Chi et al . COVID - 19 on Mental Health Frontiers in Psychiatry | www . frontiersin . org August 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 803 3 given a drawing of a ladder with 10 rungs that was described as follows : “ Think of this ladder as representing where people stand in our society . At the top of the ladder are the people who are the best off , those who have the most money , most education , and the best jobs . At the bottom are the people who are the worst off , those who have the least money , least education , and worst jobs or no job . ” They were then asked to place an X on the rung that best represents where they think their families stand on the ladder . Statistical Analyses Firstly , we described the data ( predictors and primary and secondary outcomes ) using means and standard deviations ( SD ) for continuous variables and proportions for categorical variables . We then tested the internal reliability of the survey using Cronbach ’ s alpha across the Adverse Childhood Experiences questionnaire , The Adult Attachment Scale with anxious and avoidant attachment subscale , The Connor – Davidson Resilience Scale , abbreviated PTSD Checklist ( PCL ) , the Zung Self - Rating Anxiety Scale , the 9 - item Patient Health Questionnaire , and The Post Traumatic Growth Inventory . Secondly , we reported the proportion of clinically relevant outcomes employing current recommendations for cut - off score for detecting clinically relevant levels of PTSD , anxiety , depression , and PTG ( 14 , 50 , 10 , and 57 , respectively ) ( 23 , 35 – 37 ) . Thirdly , we explored the association between predictors and primary and secondary outcomes , using RIDGE regression ( 38 ) . In RIDGE regression a penalizing factor is employed to reduce model complexity and prevent over - ﬁ tting which may result from simple linear regression . The penalty is equivalent to the square of the magnitude of the coef ﬁ cients . Using RIDGE regression , it is possible to have an idea of the importance of predictors by sorting the absolute values of coef ﬁ cients ( the most important predictor has the highest absolute value of coef ﬁ cients ) . Among the predictors we considered were : age , sex , family structure , SES , knowing people who had been isolated , current location , and the number of con ﬁ rmed cases of COVID - 19 pneumonia in each local area , ACEs , attachment type , resilience . All analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences ( SPSS , version 23 . 0 ) with p < 0 . 05 being set as a statistical signi ﬁ cance ( two - tailed ) . RESULTS Characteristics of Participants Participants ’ information is detailed in Table 1 , including levels of ACEs ( 1 . 30 ± 1 . 72 ) , anxious attachment ( 17 . 05 ± 5 . 10 ) and avoidant attachment ( 31 . 75 ± 6 . 00 ) , and resilience ( 35 . 45 ± 6 . 62 ) . Reliabilities of ACEs , anxious attachment and avoidant attachment subscale , and resilience were 0 . 73 , 0 . 86 , 0 . 73 , and 0 . 92 , respectively . The mean age of participants was 20 . 6 ( SD 1 . 90 ) , and sixty - three percent of the included participants were female . Of the respondents , 91 . 2 % were from intact families and the mean score of the subjective SES was 4 . 85 ( SD 1 . 37 ) . Regarding COVID - 19 data , 12 . 1 % indicated knowing people ( family members , relatives and / or friends ) who had been isolated , and on the day of data collection , 58 . 2 % respondents were located in areas with > 1 , 000 con ﬁ rmed cases . Prevalence of Clinically - Relevant PTSD , Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms , and PTG Severity of PTSD symptoms ( 11 . 79 ± 4 . 25 ) , anxiety symptoms ( 40 . 88 ± 8 . 48 ) , depressive symptoms ( 6 . 37± 4 . 85 ) , and levels of PTG ( 60 . 99 ± 16 . 96 ) is presented in Figure 1 . Cronbach alphas re ﬂ ected a good internal reliability of PTSD , anxiety , depression , and PTG domain with . 81 , . 82 , . 86 , and . 95 , respectively . With respect to prevalence of clinically - relevant symptoms , 30 . 8 % ( 95 % CI : 28 . 8 to 32 . 8 % ) of the individuals completing the survey presented clinically relevant PTSD symptoms , 15 . 5 % ( 95 % CI : 13 . 5 to 16 . 6 % ) anxiety , 23 . 3 % ( 95 % CI : 21 . 5 to 25 . 1 % ) depressive symptoms , and 66 . 9 % ( 95 % CI : 65 . 1 to 69 . 2 % ) of the subjects were considered to have PTG . In addition , a signi ﬁ cant proportion presented co - existing clinically - relevant symptoms : 4 . 1 % ( 95 % CI : 3 . 2 to 4 . 9 % ) displayed symptoms of PTSD , depression and anxiety simultaneously and 7 . 0 % ( 95 % CI : 6 . 0 to 8 . 2 % ) respectively presented symptoms of two conditions simultaneously ( Figure 1 ) , suggesting a highly vulnerable subgroup of individuals who develop multiple co - morbid symptoms . Correlates of Primary Outcome ( PTSD Symptoms ) Results indicated that the regression model was signi ﬁ cant ( p < 0 . 001 ) , with 10 independent variables together explaining about 13 % of variance in PTSD symptoms . Speci ﬁ cally , older age ( b = 0 . 02 , p < 0 . 001 ) , knowing people who had been isolated TABLE 1 | Characteristics of participants ( N = 2 , 038 ) .

Chi et al . COVID - 19 on Mental Health Frontiers in Psychiatry | www . frontiersin . org August 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 803 4 ( b = − 0 . 09 , p < 0 . 001 ) were found to signi ﬁ cantly predict a higher likelihood of reporting PTSD symptoms ; more ACEs ( b = 0 . 06 , p = 0 . 005 ) , higher level of anxious attachment ( b = . 18 , p < 0 . 001 ) , and lower level of resilience ( b = − 0 . 21 , p < 0 . 001 ) were signi ﬁ cantly associated with a higher probability of reporting PTSD symptoms ( Table 2 ) . Correlates of Secondary Outcomes ( Anxious and Depressive Symptoms and PTG Levels ) Firstly , the results found that the regression model was signi ﬁ cant ( p < 0 . 001 ) , with 10 independent variables together explaining about 29 . 5 % of variance in anxiety symptoms . Speci ﬁ cally , knowing people who had been isolated ( b = − 0 . 04 , p = 0 . 008 ) , more ACEs ( b = 0 . 15 , p < 0 . 001 ) , higher level of anxious attachment ( b = 0 . 17 , p < 0 . 001 ) and avoidant attachment ( b = 0 . 05 , p = 0 . 005 ) , and lower level of resilience ( b = − 0 . 34 , p < 0 . 001 ) were signi ﬁ cantly associated with greater probability of developing anxiety symptoms . Secondly , the results indicated that the regression model was signi ﬁ cant ( p < 0 . 001 ) , with 10 independent variables together explaining about 21 . 7 % of variance in depressive symptoms . Speci ﬁ cally , older age ( b = 0 . 04 , p = 0 . 03 ) , knowing people who had been isolated ( b = − 0 . 06 , p < 0 . 001 ) , more ACEs ( b = 0 . 12 , p < 0 . 001 ) , higher level of anxious attachment ( b = 0 . 24 , p < 0 . 001 ) , and lower level of resilience ( b = − 0 . 22 , p < 0 . 001 ) were signi ﬁ cantly associated with greater probability of reporting depressive symptoms . Thirdly , the results indicated that the regression model was also signi ﬁ cant ( p < 0 . 001 ) , with 10 independent variables together explaining about 18 . 3 % of variance in PTG level . Speci ﬁ cally , when analyzing predictors of PTG levels , higher subjective SES ( b = 0 . 09 , p < 0 . 001 ) , knowing people who had been isolated ( b = − 0 . 04 , p = 0 . 03 ) , and the number of con ﬁ rmed cases in participants ’ areas ( b = − 3 . 99 , p < 0 . 001 ) , fewer ACEs ( b = − 0 . 07 , p = 0 . 002 ) , lower level of avoidant attachment ( b = − 0 . 20 , p < 0 . 001 ) , and higher level of resilience ( b = 0 . 23 , p < 0 . 001 ) were signi ﬁ cantly associated with the higher level of PTG . Such detailed results are presented in Table 3 . DISCUSSION The present study showed high prevalence rates of PTSD , anxiety and depressive symptoms as well as PTG among Chinese university students during the COVID - 19 pandemic . It also identi ﬁ ed speci ﬁ c risk factors for poor mental health outcomes during stressful COVID - 19 pandemic . Prevalence rates of PTSD and PTG symptoms ( 30 . 8 or 66 . 9 % , respectively ) were comparable with those observed after the Sichuan earthquake which caused 69 , 227 deaths and 374 , 643 injuries in 2008 ( 26 , 27 ) . On one hand , college students have traumatic experiences and present some negative mental health effects during the COVID - 19 pandemic . On the other hand , personal growth re ﬂ ects that individuals have intrinsic motivation for positive growth and will seek to implement effective ways to cope with trauma and adversity ( 39 , 40 ) . Rates of anxiety symptoms ( 15 % ) was lower than those in a similar study conducted by Chang et al . that focused on 3 , 881 college students who were speci ﬁ cally selected from universities located in Guangdong province ( 26 . 6 % ) ( 9 ) .

FIGURE 1 | Prevalence of clinically relevant posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , anxiety and depressive symptoms and levels of post traumatic growth ( PTG ) . Chi et al . COVID - 19 on Mental Health Frontiers in Psychiatry | www . frontiersin . org August 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 803 5 higher percentage in that study may be due to the use of a different instrument ( the 7 - item Generalized Anxiety Disorder ) ( 12 ) with different cut - offs or the fact that it was conducted earlier ( between January 31 , 2019 and February 3 , 2020 ) . The study was conducted one week after con ﬁ rming person - to - person transmission of the COVID - 19 , which has increased anxiety . Rates of depressive symptoms ( 23 . 3 % ) matched those ( 21 . 16 % ) estimated in a previous study ( 12 ) . Also , two concomitant symptomatic dimensions among anxiety , depressive , and posttraumatic symptoms affected 4 . 1 % of participants and two of them in 7 . 0 % , con ﬁ rming previous ﬁ ndings outside of COVID - 19 context ( 41 ) . Such comorbidity ( e . g . , depression , anxiety , and PTSD ) may lead to increased risk of developing chronic mental disorder relative to depression or anxiety presence alone ( 42 ) , and so this unique group needs special attention . A number of socio - demographic risk factors identi ﬁ ed subjects with poor mental health . Higher age might be associated with more PTSD and depressive symptoms . Individually , the positive association between age and PTSD symptoms may be attributed to the fact that older students are about to experience job search competition while working on their thesis as a part of the requirements in order to successfully obtain their undergraduate degrees in China ’ s higher education . This result can also be partially explained by the fact that some of the juniors and seniors may be preparing for the graduate school entrance examination . The aforementioned behavior , to a large extent , causes more stress relative to those freshmen and sophomores , which may ultimately lead to higher level of PTSD and depressive symptoms during the COVID - 19 pandemic ( 12 ) . Moreover , higher subjective SES may predict a higher level of PTG , which is strongly supported by previous studies ( 43 – 45 ) . Such results may arise from students with higher SES being more likely to get access to safe settings , to afford masks and health equipment , and to receive food support , which may help them effectively cope with stressful events like the COVID - 19 pandemic . Knowing people who had been isolated during the COVID - 19 pandemic was signi ﬁ cantly associated with higher levels of anxiety , depression , and PTSD . It may be due to the fact that knowing someone close had been quarantined might have increased the sensation of being vulnerable . When someone we know is isolated , we become more empathetic so that naturally we think of ourselves , and then it is easy to become tense , or if the isolated person has been in contact with us before , we are even more worried about whether we will be infected . This kind of pandemic fear may cause more negative psychological feelings such as anxiety and PTSD symptoms ( 15 , 46 ) . Finally , participants living in areas with a higher number of con ﬁ rmed cases reported lower levels of PTG , which can be attributed to that the greater number of con ﬁ rmed cases makes them feel having greater possibility to be infected as they are exposed to more dangerous area . Timely mental health services should be offered in those areas with a higher number of affected people ( 46 , 47 ) . Surprisingly , the number of participant - based con ﬁ rmed cases was not signi ﬁ cantly predictive of negative emotions in this study . Since our survey was conducted in mid to late February which was one and half month after the initially identi ﬁ ed outbreak , college students had a suf ﬁ cient amount of time to adapt to such stressful environment and learn how to effectively manage their negative emotion as usual , or their negative emotion has reached a plateau . Considering psychological factors , students who reported more ACEs , higher levels of insecure attachment , especially anxious attachment , and lower levels of resilience reported signi ﬁ cantly higher level of anxiety , depression , and PTSD , whereas fewer ACEs , a lower level of avoidant attachment , and a higher level of resilience signi ﬁ cantly predicted an increased likelihood of achieving PTG . These results replicate ﬁ ndings from several previous studies ( 48 – 52 ) . Speci ﬁ cally , overarching biopsychosocial psychopathology models emphasize that negative life events , particularly those occurring during sensitive developmental periods such as adverse childhood experiences , play a major etiologic role in precipitating and / or exacerbating psychological disorder in later life , and that attachment determines adult internal and external thought and behavior schemata ( 53 , 54 ) .

Chi et al . COVID - 19 on Mental Health Frontiers in Psychiatry | www . frontiersin . org August 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 803 6 Attachment – Anxiety dimension tend to intensify negative emotional states ( hyper - activation strategies ) , whereas those with high scores on the Attachment – Avoidant dimension tend to distance themselves from emotional situations ( deactivation strategies ) , avoid developing closes relationship , and consequently may be less sensitive to stress ( 53 ) . In addition , resilience was observed to be a strong protective factor against mental health problems and promoted PTG , which is supported by previous research ( 48 ) . Resilience , re ﬂ ecting problem - solving ability or positive adaptation , is an individual ’ s ability to overcome adversities with positive emotions . It may enhance individuals ’ understanding of happiness and promote psychological health ( 48 ) . It indicates that under the current situation individuals with high resilience presented a “ mental immunity , ” which allows them to resist the psychosocial in ﬂ uences of major events ( 55 ) . Resilience should be promoted in university students as it can reduce their psychiatric symptoms and improve their PTG under stressful situations . It is essential to translate these ﬁ ndings into clinical practice and mental health policy - making . Under the current circumstances online interventions targeting vulnerable populations promoting resilience might be a viable option . More speci ﬁ cally , resilience can be promoted in different ways such as providing a supportive social network ( 56 ) , enhancing active coping self - ef ﬁ cacy strategies ( e . g . , enhancing the perception that one is able to manage or recover from a stressful event ) ( 57 ) , learning mindfulness skills ( e . g . , deep breath and focusing on the present moment ) ( 58 ) , as well as nurturing a sense of purpose of life and the ability to ﬁ nd meaning in face of COVID - 19 pandemic ( 59 ) . The ﬁ ndings of the present study need to be considered in the context of several limitations . First , a cross - sectional design and corresponding measures before COVID - 19 outbreak were not available , thus limiting any causal interpretation . Extending this cross - sectional survey to a longitudinal study would help to determine the developmental trajectory of mental health outcomes and predictors throughout the COVID - 19 epidemic . Second , our participants were mainly from Guangdong , Anhui hui , Hebei , and Jiangsu provinces , and the most strongly affected province ( Hubei ) was very poorly represented ( 1 . 6 % ) ; thus , the ﬁ ndings may not be generalized to the Hubei province . From a practical perspective , it is particularly dif ﬁ cult to obtain data from college students who were most severely affected or whose family members and relatives are under quarantine / self - isolated or being diagnosed with the COVID - 19 . Future studies may consider data collection in Hubei province after people recovered from the COVID - 19 . Third , data on previous histories of mental disorders or treatment were not collected in this study , so it largely remains unknown whether thesenbsp ; symptoms are associated with the COVID - 19 outbreak or whether they pre - existed . Future studies may include respondents ’ previous histories of mental disorders or treatment . Finally , self - report instruments were used to detect and screen anxious , depressive and PTSD symptoms , which may be considered less accurate than the rating of a clinical psychologist or psychiatrist . Future studies on this similar topic that additionally includes diagnostic instruments administered by clinical psychologists or psychiatrists are encouraged . CONCLUSIONS In conclusion , this study suggests a high prevalence of posttraumatic , anxiety and depressive symptoms , but also that many have an intrinsic motivation for positive growth during the COVID - 19 pandemic . These ﬁ ndings may help provide important information for future tracking or intervention research in this group . Speci ﬁ c risk factors exist to identify subjects at risk of poor mental health . While early traumatic events in childhood and insecure attachment are risk factors , resilience is a modi ﬁ able factor and a potential therapeutic target to prevent poor mental health outcome during COVID - 19 pandemic .
