INTRODUCTION The plasma membrane is the interface a cell has with its envi - ronment and its neighbors . It is the site of vectorial transport of ions and nutrients , reception of signalling molecules , and attachments to adjacent cells and the extracellular matrix . To perform these functions , the membrane is supported and organized into domains by the underlying actin cytoskeleton , which together constitute the cell cortex . Thus , the cortical cytoskeleton not only contributes to structural support , but must also be regulated to coordinate the dynamic functions of membranes , such as endocytosis , exocytosis , and transmem - brane and other cortical signalling pathways . Of particular interest are proteins that link the cortical cytoskeleton to the membrane . The ERM ( ezrin - radixin - moesin ) family of proteins appear to play structural and regulatory roles by stabilizing specialized plasma membrane domains during development and in adult tissues . Here , we try to distil from an historical perspective what is known about the ERM family , but with particular emphasis on ezrin . We also include areas of uncertainty that will be clariﬁed through the study of diverse systems . The emphasis and ﬂavor of this discussion is intended to extend and complement other reviews on ERM proteins ( Arpin et al . , 1994 ; Bretscher , 1991 , 1993 ; Bretscher and Berryman , 1997 ; Tsukita et al . , 1997a , b ) . Ezrin is the best studied member of the ERM family , proteins that share approximately 75 % primary sequence identity ( Funayama et al . , 1991 ; Gould et al . , 1989 ; Lankes and Furthmayr , 1991 ; Sato et al . , 1992 ; Turunen et al . , 1989 ) . ERM proteins belong to the band 4 . 1 superfamily , because they show homology to the ﬁrst ~ 300 residues of erythrocyte band 4 . 1 , which connects the actin / spectrin network to the membrane protein glycophorin C ( Anderson and Lovrien , 1984 ; Leto and Marchesi , 1984 ; Marfatia et al . , 1994 , 1995 ) . Based on this homology and the cytoskeletal localization of ezrin , Gould et al . ( 1989 ) suggested that the N - terminal domain of ezrin associates with the membrane , whereas the C - terminal half links it to the cytoskeleton . This hypothesis was substantiated by transfection experiments which demon - strated that the N - terminal half of ezrin associates with the plasma membrane , whereas the C - terminal half associates with the actin cytoskeleton ( Algrain et al . , 1993 ) . Because of the high degree of homology among ERM members , many of the properties that pertain to ezrin also apply to radixin and moesin . However , their tissue distributions and primary struc - tures indicate that these are not simply redundant proteins . Although all three proteins are expressed in most cultured cells ( Amieva and Furthmayr , 1995 ; Franck et al . , 1993 ; Sato et al . , 1992 ) , cells in the body exhibit very distinct and restricted patterns of expression ( Amieva and Furthmayr , 3011 Journal of Cell Science 110 , 3011 - 3018 ( 1997 ) Printed in Great Britain © The Company of Biologists Limited 1997 JCS5001 The cortical cytoskeleton of eucaryotic cells provides struc - tural support to the plasma membrane and also contributes to dynamic processes such as endocytosis , exocytosis , and transmembrane signaling pathways . The ERM ( ezrin - radixin - moesin ) family of proteins , of which ezrin is the best studied member , play structural and regulatory roles in the assembly and stabilization of specialized plasma membrane domains . Ezrin and related molecules are concentrated in surface projections such as microvilli and membrane ruffles where they link the microﬁlaments to the membrane . The present knowledge about ezrin is discussed from an historical perspective . Both biochemical and cell biological studies have revealed that ezrin can exist in a dormant con - formation that requires activation to expose otherwise masked association sites . Current results indicate that activated ezrin monomers or head - to - tail oligomers associate directly with F - actin through a domain in its C terminus , and with the membrane through its N - terminal domain . The association of ezrin with transmembrane proteins can be direct , as in the case of CD44 , or indirect through EBP50 . Other binding partners , including the regulatory subunit of protein kinase A and rho - GDI , suggest that ezrin is an integral component of these signaling pathways . Although the membrane - cytoskeletal linking function is clear , further studies are necessary to reveal how the activation of ezrin and its association with different binding partners is regulated .

Shcherbina et al . , unpublished ) . In addition , a polyproline stretch of unknown function that is present in ezrin and radixin is absent from moesin . Although ezrin and radixin are substrates for certain tyrosine kinases ( Bretscher , 1989 ; Crepaldi et al . , 1997 ; Egerton et al . , 1992 ; Fazioli et al . , 1993 ; Gould et al . , 1986 ; Jiang et al . , 1995 ; Louvet et al . , 1996 ; Thuillier et al . , 1994 ) , there is evidence to indicate that the patterns of phosphorylation are distinct among family members ( Fazioli et al . , 1993 ) . In one example , treatment of human A431 carcinoma cells with EGF results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of ezrin but not moesin ( Franck et al . , 1993 ) , yet moesin contains one of the homologous tyrosines phos - phorylated in ezrin ( Krieg and Hunter , 1992 ) . To date no clear functional differences have been documented between members of the family , so this discussion will be largely devoted to ezrin’s biochemical properties and biological functions . DISCOVERIES LEADING TO EZRIN The number of diverse systems in which ezrin was indepen - dently identiﬁed as a potentially interesting molecule is remarkable . The ﬁrst was as an 81 kDa polypeptide that became phosphorylated very rapidly on tyrosine in response to EGF stimulation of A431 human carcinoma cells ( Hunter and Cooper , 1981 ) . It was subsequently identiﬁed as a component of isolated chicken intestinal microvilli , from where it was puriﬁed and characterized as a cytoskeletal protein . Immunoﬂuorescence microscopy showed that ezrin is concentrated in actin - rich cell surface structures , such as microvilli , ﬁlopodia and membrane ruffles ( Bretscher , 1983 ) . It was then shown that the phosphoprotein from A431 cells was identical to the microvillar cytoskeletal protein ( Gould et al . , 1986 ) . Meanwhile , ~ 81 kDa polypeptides , later identiﬁed as ezrin , were under study in several other systems . Pakkanen et al . ( 1987 ) found that an antibody , generated to a peptide based on a human endogenous retroviral DNA sequence ( Suni et al . , 1984 ) , recognized a ~ 75 kDa protein found in cell surface structures and subsequently named it cytovillin ( Pakkanen , 1988 ; Pakkanen et al . , 1988 ; Pakkanen and Vaheri , 1989 ) . Sequence analysis revealed that ezrin and cytovillin are identical ( Gould et al . , 1989 ; Turunen et al . , 1989 ) . Urushidani et al . ( 1989 ) and Hanzel et al . ( 1989 ) identiﬁed an 80 kDa polypeptide potentially involved in acid secretion in parietal cells of the gastric glands . Stimulation of parietal cells induces cytoplasmic tubulovesicles containing the proton pump to fuse with the apical membrane to form microvilli ( for review , see Forte et al . , 1989 ) . During this remarkable transformation , which involves activation of protein kinase A ( PKA ) , the 80 kDa polypeptide becomes phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues , and can be isolated from the apical microvilli in association with actin and the pump . Hanzel et al . ( 1991 ) established that the 80 kDa polypeptide is ezrin . Ullrich et al . ( 1986 ) identiﬁed and puriﬁed an 82 kDa tumor antigen from a methylcholanthrene - induced sarcoma ; this protein was subsequently shown to be ezrin ( Fazioli et al . , 1993 ) . Ezrin was also identiﬁed as a tyrosine kinase substrate in T - cells ( Egerton et al . , 1992 ) . SUBCELLULAR LOCALIZATION OF EZRIN A general theme that applies not only to ezrin , but to all ERM proteins , is their presence in the apical domain of polarized cells , a region usually characterized by the presence of microvilli . Although ERM proteins can have overlapping dis - tributions in certain epithelial cell types , such as the presence of all three in the brush border of the kidney proximal tubule epithelium , other epithelia preferentially express ezrin and endothelia express moesin ( Berryman et al . , 1993 ; Schwartz - Albiez et al . , 1995 ) . In a careful study of liver tissue , Amieva et al . ( 1994 ) have shown that hepatocytes only express radixin , that the epithelial cells lining the bile ducts express both ezrin and radixin , and that the endothelial cells only express moesin . Signiﬁcantly , they also reported that moesin is concentrated on the apical ( luminal ) domain of endothelial cells . Thus , all three ERM proteins are associated with microvilli . Although ERM proteins are prominent in epithelial tissues , other cell types within the body can also express one or more family members ( Berryman et al . , 1993 ; A . Shcherbina et al . , unpublished ; Schwartz - Albiez et al . , 1995 ) . In contrast to adult tissues , which show distinct patterns of ERM expression , cultured cell lines usually express all three ERM proteins ( Sato et al . , 1992 ; Amieva and Furthmayr , 1995 ) . Immunoﬂuorescence studies with speciﬁc antibodies has shown that all three are concentrated in actin - rich surface structures such as microvilli , membrane ruffles , and ﬁlopodia ( Amieva and Furthmayr , 1995 ; Franck et al . , 1993 ) . Immuno - electron microscopy of ezrin in human placental syncytiotro - phoblast and mouse mesothelia has shown that ezrin is highly concentrated in the microvilli where it is associated with the cytoplasmic aspect of the plasma membrane ( Berryman et al . , 1993 ) . The relatively low levels of ezrin on adjacent regions of the apical membrane between microvilli supports the notion that ezrin plays a special role in the attachment of microﬁla - ments to the membrane speciﬁcally within microvilli . Although ezrin has been reported to be concentrated in adherens junctions ( Takeuchi et al . , 1994 ) , we and others cannot detect a signiﬁcant enrichment of either ezrin or moesin in these structures in cultured cells or in tissues , such as intestine ( Amieva and Furthmayr , 1995 ; Berryman et al . , 1993 ) . One explanation for this discrepancy is that at the light microscope level , ERM proteins can appear to be enriched in adherens junctions or cleavage furrows of cultured cells simply because microvilli can be particularly abundant at these sites ( Yonemura et al . , 1993 ; our unpublished observations ) . Radixin was originally isolated as a component of adherens junctions puriﬁed from liver ( Tsukita et al . , 1989 ) . It has been localized to these junctions in liver and intestine ( Funayama et al . , 1991 ; Tsukita et al . , 1989 ) , and to focal contacts , cleavage furrows ( Sato et al . , 1991 ) , and the contractile ring of cultured cells ( Henry et al . , 1995 ) . We have also examined the subcel - lular distribution of radixin in cultured cells and found it con - centrated in membrane ruffles and microvilli , but not in focal contacts ( our unpublished data ) . These results are consistent with the results of Amieva et al . ( 1994 ) , who showed that radixin is associated with microvilli and not with adherens junctions of hepatocytes in rat liver sections . However , since different antibodies may recognize different activation states of ERM proteins ( see below ) , we cannot exclude the possibility that additional locations exist , and thus the enrichment of ERM A . Bretscher , D . Reczek and M . Berryman 3013 Ezrin in assembly of cell surface structures proteins in adherens junctions in tissues , and in focal contacts and the contractile ring of cultured cells , remains controver - sial . Nevertheless , the presence of ERM proteins in microvilli , especially on the apical aspect of polarized cells , seems to be a common feature that implicates their involvement in the organization of this plasma membrane domain . CONFORMATIONAL REGULATION OF EZRIN Recently , several lines of investigation have indicated that ezrin can exist in various ‘dormant’ or ‘active’ states ( see Fig . 2 ) . Although the majority of the ezrin in soluble extracts of intesti - nal or placental tissues is monomeric ( Bretscher , 1983 , 1989 ) , a deﬁned subset of ezrin can self - associate or associate with moesin in cultured cells that express both proteins ( Bretscher et al . , 1995 ; Gary and Bretscher , 1993 ) . In baculovirus infected insect cells that overexpress ezrin , a massive accumulation of the protein occurs under the plasma membrane , also suggest - ing self - association under these circumstances ( Andreoli et al . , 1994 ) . As depicted in Fig . 1 , the N - terminal 296 residues of ezrin or moesin fold into a domain that associates with the C - terminal 107 residues of any ERM member ; these domains are known as N - and C - ERMADs ( ERM association domains ) ( Gary and Bretscher , 1995 ) . In the native monomer the C - ERMAD is masked , thus precluding spontaneous oligomeriza - tion . Likewise , the F - actin binding site located at the C terminus of ezrin ( Pestonjamasp et al . , 1995 ; Turunen et al . , 1994 ) is also masked ( Gary and Bretscher , 1995 ) . In accord with the results for ezrin , Magendantz et al . ( 1995 ) have shown that the native N - terminal domain of radixin binds to denatured full - length radixin , conditions which expose the C - ERMAD . These biochemical ﬁndings indicate that the native monomer can exist in a ‘dormant’ state that needs to be ‘activated’ to expose the C - ERMAD and allow for F - actin binding or asso - ciation with an available N - ERMAD . Further examination of ezrin forms in placenta has uncovered two relevant ﬁndings . First , soluble ezrin from placenta can be isolated as a relatively globular monomer or a highly extended dimer : both have masked C - ERMADs ( Bretscher et al . , 1995 ) . Second , in isolated placental microvilli ezrin exists in oligomeric form , with extended dimers , trimers etc . comprising the bulk of the microvillar ezrin ( Berryman et al . , 1995 ) . Moreover , during EGF treatment of A431 cells there is a close temporal corre - lation between the formation of microvilli and ezrin dimers , suggesting that cell surface structures are enriched in oligomeric forms of ezrin . We therefore proposed a working model in which most of the ezrin in a resting cell exists in a dormant state with masked C - ERMAD and F - actin binding sites , and possibly also with a masked membrane association site . Activation , perhaps involving multiple steps , can lead to the exposure of self - assembly and / or F - actin and membrane binding sites ( Berryman et al . , 1995 ; see Fig . 2 ) . In parallel with these studies , Martin et al . ( 1995 ) reported that high level expression of the C - terminal half of ezrin in insect cells induced the formation of long cellular protrusions , whereas high level expression of the full length molecule did not . They also found that the morphological changes induced by the C - terminal construct could be suppressed by coexpres - sion of the N - terminal domain . These results indicate that the C - terminal half of the molecule has morphological effects that can be masked by the N - terminal half in either the full length molecule or supplied as a separate domain . More recently , Martin et al . ( 1997 ) have shown that the situation is more complex : expression of a construct which lacks the 21 C - terminal residues also induces long protrusions , and even expression of the N - terminal domain alone ( residues 1 - 310 ) has similar effects . The coincidence of regions necessary for morphological effects with those implicated in binding actin ( Roy et al . , 1997 ) makes the physiological relevance of these studies seem plausible . Likewise , Henry et al . ( 1995 ) found that overexpression of the C - terminal half of radixin , but not the entire protein , led to the formation of long surface struc - tures on NIH 3T3 cells . These cell biological studies indepen - dently suggest that ERM proteins have biological activities that are masked in the full length molecule . ACTIN BINDING PROPERTIES OF EZRIN Ezrin was originally puriﬁed from the microﬁlament bundle of isolated intestinal microvilli , yet the native protein possessed no convincing F - actin binding activity ( Bretscher , 1983 ) . Using GST - ezrin fusion constructs , Turunen et al . ( 1994 ) identiﬁed an F - actin binding site in the C - terminal 35 residues , which was conﬁrmed independently for all ERM members using F - actin overlays ( Pestonjamasp et al . , 1995 ) . The F - actin overlays also indicated that ERM proteins bind with high affinity to the * N - ERMADs ( in ezrin , radixin & moesin ) N - ERMAD Polyproline * Binding site for F - actin C - ERMAD Binding sites for : * C - ERMADs ( in ezrin , radixin & moesin ) * CD44 ( integral membrane protein ) * EBP50 ( PDZ - containing phosphoprotein ) * Rho - GDI ( Rho pathway regulator ) PIP 2 ( lipid signalling molecule ) Y353 Y145 RII - regulatory subunit of PKA N C 1 296 468 - 474 585 Band 4 . 1 Homology Domain a - helical domain Fig . 1 .

No function has yet been ascribed to the polyproline stretch . 3014 sides of ﬁlaments , consistent with immunoelectron microscopy studies which show a uniform distribution of ezrin along the length of microvilli ( Berryman et al . , 1993 ) . Although several investigators have successfully used muscle a - actin in their assays ( Pestonjamasp et al . , 1995 ; Turunen et al . , 1994 ; Roy et al . , 1997 ) , others have provided evidence that ezrin exhibits isoform speciﬁcity . Shuster and Herman ( 1995 ) found that some of the ezrin from pericytes was retained on a column containing immobilized nonmuscle F - b - actin , but not immobilized muscle F - a - actin . They also reported that puriﬁed pericyte ezrin did not bind F - b - actin directly , and suggested that the interaction might be mediated by a b - actin speciﬁc binding protein ; in view of our current understanding , perhaps the bulk of the isolated pericyte ezrin was dormant and had a masked F - actin binding site . Yao et al . ( 1995 , 1996 ) showed that the distribution of ezrin in parietal cells coincides with that of b - actin , and that ezrin isolated from parietal cells bound b / g - but not F - a - actin in vitro . In addition to the interesting possibility that the isolated parietal cell ezrin was in an activated form , it is also possible that ezrin simply binds with greater affinity to b - actin than to the a - isoform , as discussed by Yao et al . ( 1996 ) . Two reports suggest that ERM proteins have other actin binding activities . Radixin was isolated as a barbed - end capping protein making use of immobilized monomeric actin in the puriﬁcation procedure ( Tsukita et al . , 1989 ) ; however , no monomeric actin binding site was detected in native ezrin using this approach ( Bretscher , 1986 ) . Recently , Roy et al . ( 1997 ) employed a solid phase assay to detect actin binding activities in full length and truncated ezrin . Although no simple C - terminal F - actin binding site was detected , they found one F - actin binding site in the N - terminal domain ( 1 - 310 ) , and a second site present in the full length molecule and requiring residues 13 - 30 . In addition , a G - actin binding site was mapped to residues 288 - 310 . Clearly the nature of the binding of ezrin to actin has not yet been resolved satisfactorily and appears to be quite complicated . A perplexing and perhaps revealing ﬁnding is that much of the ezrin and actin in isolated placental microvilli is highly resistant to extraction ( Berryman et al . , 1995 ) . Perhaps under certain circumstances , ezrin has the ability to bind avidly to F - actin and stabilize it against depoly - merization . The possibility also exists that ezrin binding to F - actin is enhanced by an additional factor in a ternary complex , as is the case for the band 4 . 1 / spectrin / F - actin complex ( Ungewickell et al . , 1979 ) . MEMBRANE ASSOCIATION OF EZRIN Since ezrin shares homology with the membrane binding domain of erythrocyte band 4 . 1 , a major goal has been to identify the membrane protein ( s ) to which it binds . Tsukita et al . ( 1994 ) used a monoclonal antibody to co - immunoprecipi - tate moesin together with several additional proteins from BHK cells , among which was the hyaluronate receptor CD44 . Immunoprecipitation of CD44 recovered all three ERM members , suggesting that they all can bind to this transmem - brane protein . Hirao et al . ( 1996 ) extended these ﬁndings to show in vitro that full - length ERM members require PIP 2 to bind the cytoplasmic tail of CD44 , whereas the isolated N - terminal domains bind with high affinity in the absence of PIP 2 . Apparently , PIP 2 can activate the dormant protein and expose the membrane binding site . Niggli et al . ( 1995 ) have shown that full length ezrin binds PIP 2 in vitro , and have mapped the binding site to the N - terminal domain . It is likely that other membrane attachment proteins exist for ERM members , because CD44 is not found in some cells that are highly enriched in ezrin , such as the placental syncytiotrophoblast ( St Jacques et al . , 1993 ) . In addition , the subcellular distribution of ERM proteins in polarized epithelial tissues does not always correspond to that of CD44 , which is usually found in the baso - lateral membrane . In another system , Helander et al . ( 1996 ) have shown that transfection of human ezrin into mouse thymoma BW5147 cells induces the formation of the actin - based uropod and redistribution of the intercellular adhesion molecule ICAM - 2 to uropods which renders the cells suscep - tible to attack by IL - 2 - activated killer cells . It is therefore possible that ezrin also binds directly or indirectly to the cyto - plasmic domain of ICAM - 2 . Reczek et al . ( 1997 ) have isolated a family of 50 - 55 kDa phosphoproteins from human placenta and bovine brain that bind to the immobilized N - terminal domains of ezrin or moesin with high affinity . The human protein , called EBP50 ( ERM binding phosphoprotein 50 ) is 357 residues long and contains two PDZ domains in the N - terminal half of the molecule . Since PDZ domains can associate with the cytoplasmic tails of trans - membrane proteins ( Saras and Heldin , 1996 ) , it seems likely that EBP50 links ERM members to one or more integral membrane proteins . The probable rabbit homolog of EBP50 , referred to as NHE - RF ( Na + / H + exchanger regulatory factor ) , was identiﬁed as a cofactor necessary for the PKA regulation of the renal Na + / H + exchanger ( Weinman et al . , 1993 ) and shares 84 % identity with EBP50 ( Reczek et al . , 1997 ; Weinman et al . , 1995 ) . Using the yeast two - hybrid system to search for proteins that bind to the cytoplasmic domain of the NHE3 isoform of the exchanger , Yun et al . ( 1997 ) recovered a clone encoding a protein ( called E3KARP ) having two N - terminal PDZ domains with > 70 % identity over this region to both EBP50 and NHE - RF . The second PDZ domain of E3KARP appears to be sufficient for interaction with NHE3 . Since the N - terminal domain of ezrin binds to the C - terminal region of EBP50 ( D . R . and A . Bretscher , unpublished ) , it is possible that EBP50 links ezrin to NHE3 , in tissues containing this exchanger ( Tse et al . , 1992 ) . Given the relatively high levels of EBP50 expression in organs rich in epithelia ( Reczek et al . , 1997 ) , it seems reasonable to speculate that it may also link ERM proteins to alternate transmembrane proteins in other cells . The ﬁnding of a protein containing PDZ domains that interacts with the N - terminal domains of ERM members is reminiscent of membrane associations in other cortical systems . A protein known as p55 , containing a single PDZ domain , an SH3 domain and a guanylate kinase ( GUK ) domain , is involved in the association of the N - terminal domain of band 4 . 1 with glycophorin C in erythrocytes ( Marfatia et al . , 1994 , 1995 ) . The Drosophila discs - large tumor suppressor protein has three PDZ domains , one SH3 domain and a GUK domain ( Woods and Bryant , 1991 ) . Its human homolog , hDlg , has a similar domain organization , binds to the N - terminal domain of band 4 . 1 , and localizes to membranes and regions of cell - cell contact ( Lue et al . , 1994 ) . One binding site for band 4 . 1 resides in a basic region between the SH3 and GUK A . Bretscher , D . Reczek and M . Berryman 3015 Ezrin in assembly of cell surface structures domains , and the ﬁrst two PDZ domains associate with the Shaker K + channel ( Lue et al . , 1996 ; Marfatia et al . , 1996 ) . Although ezrin has been reported to be a component of a complex recovered by immunoprecipitation with hDlg anti - bodies , probably by direct interaction with hDlg ( Lue et al . , 1996 ) , no direct binding of ezrin to hDlg was detected in vitro ( Marfatia et al . , 1996 ) . Therefore , PDZ - containing proteins constitute another mechanism by which ezrin associates with transmembrane proteins . ADDITIONAL EZRIN BINDING PARTNERS Ezrin has been identiﬁed recently as an anchoring protein for the regulatory RII subunit of PKA in parietal cells , suggesting it might be involved in the functional localization of PKA ( Dransﬁeld et al . , 1997 ) . Interestingly , Dransﬁeld et al . ( 1997 ) reported that the RII subunit of PKA appears to be capable of binding to essentially all the ezrin in cell extracts , suggesting that it is the ﬁrst example of a protein that can bind to dormant ezrin . Putting this study together with those of Reczek et al . ( 1997 ) and Yun et al . ( 1997 ) , an attractive model can be envisaged whereby the PKA catalytic and regulatory complex bound to ezrin is recruited by EBP50 ( or E3KARP ) to trans - porters such as NHE3 , thus localizing the kinase for cAMP - dependent regulation of their activities . Another ERM binding partner has been discovered recently : Hirao et al . ( 1996 ) reported that moesin immunoprecipitates contain Rho - GDI ( Rho - GDP - dissociation inhibitor ) in addition to CD44 . Further evidence that the Rho signalling pathway involves ERM proteins came from experiments which showed that the association of exogenous ERM proteins with CD44 in permeabilized BHK cells was reduced when Rho was inacti - vated and enhanced when activated Rho was present . Most recently , Takahashi et al . ( 1997 ) have found that binding of Rho - GDI to the N - terminal domain of ERM members releases Rho to activate Rho - dependent processes . By contrast , Mackay et al . ( 1997 ) have reported that in permeabilized quiescent 3T3 ﬁbroblasts ERM proteins are an essential downstream component of active Rho and Rac to induce the assembly of stress ﬁbers and lamellipodia . From these studies , it seems possible that ERM proteins may play dual roles ( Fig . 2 ) acting in the upstream activation of the Rho pathway ( e . g . binding Rho - GDI ) , and as downstream targets of activated Rho and Rac ( e . g . stimulation of membrane - cytoskeletal linkages and the assembly of actin - based cortical structures ) . REGULATION OF CORTICAL STRUCTURE BY EZRIN There is considerable evidence to indicate that ezrin regulates the structure of the cortical cytoskeleton to control cell surface topography . For example , there is a good correlation between tyrosine or serine / threonine phosphorylation and the formation Fig . 2 . A working model for the involvement of ezrin in the assembly of actin - rich surface structures and in Rho signalling pathways . For both of these pathways , dormant ezrin has to be activated in one or more steps , perhaps through interaction with the lipid PIP 2 or as a substrate of tyrosine and serine / threonine kinases ( 1 ) ; the number and types of activated forms is not yet known . Following activation to unmask binding sites , ezrin can associate with itself and / or membrane and cytoskeletal components ( 2 ) ; some of these associations require active Rho ( 3 ) . Activation of a sufficient number of ezrin molecules ( 4 ) may lead to cytoskeletal membrane associations ( adaptor and membrane proteins are not shown ) , and together with an F - actin crosslinker such as a - actinin , induces the formation of cell surface structures ( 5 ) . An activated ezrin form appears to be involved indirectly in the activation of Rho through the sequestration of Rho - GDI ( 6 ) which results in the release of free Rho to associate with the membrane and initiate downstream events , some of which might also require ERM proteins ( 7 ) . Note that in this diagram , each solid arrow may represent more than one step , and broken lines indicate less well deﬁned pathways . 3016 of microvilli and membrane ruffles that contain abundant ezrin ( Bretscher , 1989 ; Hanzel et al . , 1989 ; Thuillier et al . , 1994 ) . Although mutation of the two major tyrosine phosphorylation sites to phenylalanine renders transfected LLC - PK1 cells unre - sponsive to hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF , also known as scatter factor ) , which normally induces tyrosine phosphoryla - tion of ezrin and dramatic morphological changes , this does not preclude the localization of ezrin to microvilli ( Crepaldi et al . , 1997 ) . Administration of antisense oligonucleotides to suppress expression of all ERM proteins results in the loss of cell surface microvilli and cell contacts ( Takeuchi et al . , 1994 ) . As elabo - rated above , overexpression of C - terminal domains of ezrin or radixin with unmasked activities leads to a dramatic reorgani - zation of cortical microﬁlaments ( Henry et al . , 1995 ; Martin et al . , 1995 , 1997 ) . It follows that overexpression of just the N - ERMAD in an otherwise wild type cell might be expected to rapidly bind and mask any C - terminal sites uncovered by signal transduction pathways . Such a situation has just been reported : Crepaldi et al . ( 1997 ) found that overexpression of the ezrin N - ERMAD in kidney - derived LLC - PK1 cells acts as a dominant negative molecule to greatly reduce the number of cell surface microvilli and render the cells unresponsive to HGF / scatter factor . Given these ﬁndings , it is not surprising that ezrin undergoes reorganization during development in cells that assemble microvilli . During mouse embryogenesis , ezrin is localized to microvilli over the whole cell surface from the oocyte until compaction , when the cells become polarized and ezrin becomes restricted to the abundant apical microvilli ( Louvet et al . , 1996 ) . Likewise , following fertilization of sea urchin eggs , a massive assembly of moesin - containing surface microvilli occurs ( Bachman and McClay , 1995 ) . It will be very interest - ing to uncover the signals that activate the ERM proteins in these systems . Even less is known about the disassembly of dynamic cortical structures . However , Chen et al . ( 1995 ) have shown that dephosphorylation of ezrin on serine / threonine residues correlates with the disassembly of microvilli in kidney during anoxia . It is also noteworthy that ezrin is also very susceptible to calpain cleavage , so this protease may play an active role in the disassembly of cortical structures ( Shuster and Herman , 1995 ; Yao et al . , 1993 ) . Interestingly , moesin is much more resistant to calpain , and in fact survives during platelet activa - tion ( Nakamura et al . , 1996 ; A . Shcherbina et al . , unpublished ) . Perhaps one of the functional differences between ezrin and moesin is their different susceptibilities to regulatory proteases , possibly explaining the absence of ezrin ( and radixin ) from platelets ( A . Shcherbina et al . , unpublished ) . PERSPECTIVES Nearly 15 years ago , ezrin was simply known as a minor component of cell surface structures . Now it is recognized as the prototypic member of the ERM family - a family of highly regulated molecules playing a central role in determining the structure and function of the plasma membrane ( Fig . 2 ) . The models that apply to ezrin , radixin and moesin will undoubt - edly be tested for merlin / schwannomin , the neuroﬁbromatosis type 2 ( NF2 ) tumor suppressor gene product ( Rouleau et al . , 1993 ; Troffater et al . , 1993 ) . This protein shares 61 % sequence identity with ezrin over the N - terminal domain , but is more divergent in its C - terminal half . Currently , little is known about the biochemistry and cell biology of merlin / schwannomin , although it does appear to be enriched in ruffling membranes ( Gonzalez - Agosti et al . , 1996 ; Sainio et al . , 1997 ) . There are many fascinating questions that remain to be answered , some of which are indicated in Fig . 2 . For example , how is ezrin activated , and how many different activated forms are there ? Is activation speciﬁcally elicited at the membrane ( by phosphorylation , PIP 2 or perhaps downstream of activated membrane - bound Rho ) , or can it occur as a result of a cyto - plasmic signalling pathway ? Does the mode of activation determine the speciﬁcity of ligand binding ? Does the mode of activation vary during development , and does it differ among cell types or ERM family members ? Ezrin associates with CD44 and EBP50 for membrane association , but what is the full repertoire of membrane - associated ligands ? Do ERM proteins help regulate the activities of their membrane binding partners , perhaps through association with kinases , such as PKA ? How is ezrin restricted to the apical aspect of polarized cells ? In other parts of the molecule , how is F - actin binding regulated , and how is ezrin restricted to surface structures that contain an actin cytoskeleton ? Why are there three members of this family with very distinct tissue distributions ? The full story of how conformational activation of ERM proteins regulates plasma membrane topography is therefore far from complete .
