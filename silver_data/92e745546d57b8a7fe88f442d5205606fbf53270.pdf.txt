Such activities are especially important for young scientists . But most publishers do not collect gender , age or any other relevant demographic infor - mation from authors or reviewers . So biases here have been harder to pin down . Most studies of gender inequality in publishing have assigned gender to authors 3 , 4 but have lacked information on age .

Here we present evidence that women of all ages have fewer opportunities to take part in peer review . Using a large data set that includes the genders and ages of authors and reviewers from 2012 to 2015 for the jour - nals of the American Geophysical Union ( AGU ) , we show that women were used less as reviewers than expected ( on the basis of their proportion of membership of the society and as published authors in AGU journals ) .

These findings underline the need for efforts to increase female scientists’ engage - ment in manuscript reviewing to help in the advancement and retention of women in science . THE DATA SET With 20 journals and nearly 6 , 000 papers published per year , the AGU is the largest society publisher of Earth and space science . Like many other publishers , it does not ask authors and reviewers to report their age or gender . But the AGU is the largest Earth and space society in the world and it has asked its members to self - report this information since 2013 . Overall , 79 % of members from 2013 to 2015 ( 59 , 316 people ) reported both . We call this the AGU membership data set . We have gender and age data on a further 38 , 115 individuals who have AGU accounts and who engaged in AGU activities after 2011 ( see Supplementary Information ; go . nature . com / 2ifshqs ) . We refer to this group combined with the membership data set as the AGU ‘all accounts’ data set . Checks on random samples indicate that the gender distribution of members choosing not to disclose this information is similar to that of members who did , and that the gender and age information were reported accurately . To reveal gender and age data on authors and reviewers between 2012 and 2015 , we merged data on their activities ( the ‘editorial’ data set ) with the all - accounts data set using unique e - mail information . This merged data set represents the ages ( at time of activity ) and genders of 106 , 305 authors across all submit - ted manuscripts , 24 , 368 distinct authors , 62 , 552 reviews and 14 , 919 distinct review - ers , as well as 97 , 083 reviewer suggestions by authors and 118 , 873 reviewer requests by edi - tors . The data set represents 35 % of all distinct authors , 57 % of distinct reviewers , 50 % of all authors and 69 % of all reviews completed . These data represent a significant refer - ence sample of engaged , practising and aspiring Earth and space scientists , even though they do not capture all author and reviewer interactions . Membership of the AGU or an affiliated society is required to submit an abstract to the annual meeting , one of the largest scientific conferences worldwide ( 22 , 000 presentations and 25 , 000 attendees in 2015 ) , and all attendees must create an AGU account . AGU membership is dominated by academic and government scientists ( 77 % , with just 5 % in industry ) and by scientists in the United States ( 59 % ) , Japan ( 5 % ) , the United Kingdom ( 4 % ) and the rest of Europe ( 15 % ) . Proportions are similar for the all - accounts data set . In short , the AGU makes a good proxy for STEM demographics in the United States . From 2013 to 2015 , 28 % of members , on average , were women . This is close to the ratio of scientists and engineers employed in the United States ( 29 % in 2013 ) 5 and US - employed Earth and space scientists ( 25 % in 2014 ) 6 . The gender ratio of AGU member - ship decreases with age . The older cohorts have fewer women , reflecting historically higher barriers to inclusion of women and the greater rate of attrition of women from Earth and space science careers ( known as the leaky pipeline ) 2 . The youngest age group in 2015 ( 20s ) , by contrast , is 45 % female . We have not extrapolated our analysis to the complete editorial data set because we have no age data for these additional participants ( even if we could assign gender ) . SUBMISSIONS AND PUBLICATIONS We matched the gender and age of 7 , 196 distinct first authors who submitted 22 , 067 manuscripts in 2012 – 15 . In the geo - sciences , first - authored papers are particu - larly important to career development , hiring and promotion decisions . In most cases , the first author is also the corresponding author ( 89 % in our data set ) . Women made up 26 % of submitting first authors ( they accounted UNEQUAL OPPORTUNITIES Despite journals of the American Geophysical Union ( AGU ) accepting women’s papers at a higher rate than they do men’s across all age groups ( A ) , both female and male authors ( B ) and editors ( C ) suggest and invite fewer women — of every age — to referee than are available ( D ) . Women also say ‘no’ more frequently than men in the same age group when asked by the AGU to do peer review ( E ) .

Overall , women participated less as authors relative to the make - up of the membership and all - accounts data sets in aggregate and across all age cohorts . Female first authors ( n = 2 , 859 ) on average also submitted 0 . 79 fewer papers per person in the four - year period than male first authors ( n = 8 , 098 ) . The acceptance rate for female first - authored papers was higher than for male ones ( 61 % compared with 57 % ) . Negligible differences have been found by other stud - ies in biology and medicine 7 . In our data , female first authors had higher acceptance rates across all age groups , and the differ - ences were significant at P < 0 . 05 for all age cohorts under 60 . This difference in accept - ance rates pertained ( although not always with significance ) across papers with any size of author group , including single - author papers . Acceptance rates were similar regard - less of the gender of the editor or reviewers . One might interpret the difference in acceptance rates in two ways . It could imply that female AGU authors are enjoying ‘reverse sex discrimination’ , as suggested by recent studies ( see , for example , ref . 8 ) . Or — and this is the possibility we favour — the higher acceptance rates reflect the authors’ more considered approach when submitting man - uscripts , including better targeting of papers to a journal . Several studies have shown that groups who are expecting obstacles put greater effort into preparation or take fewer risks 9 . And our data show that women sub - mitted fewer papers than men . A double - blinded reviewing process could shed more light on these factors . PEER REVIEW The gender ratio of reviewers should be simi - lar to that of published authors of similar age and to the AGU membership . But women constituted 20 % of all of the individual reviewers in 2012 – 15 , substantially less than the proportion of distinct published female first authors ( 27 % ) , published authors ( 23 % ) and AGU members ( 28 % ) or all - accounts holders ( 29 % ; see ‘Unequal opportunities’ ) . These lower proportions of female reviewers were evident across most ages and were sta - tistically significant in the 50s cohort . Thus , the lower participation by women as review - ers is not just because editors were seeking more - senior reviewers , who are predomi - nantly male . Furthermore , men ( n = 11 , 876 ) did more reviews per person ( 2 . 1 reviews ) than did women ( n = 3 , 043 ; 1 . 8 reviews ) . There are two possible reasons for wom - en’s lower participation rates . First , authors and editors ( or both ) might have nominated fewer women in each age group to review ( at the AGU , authors suggest reviewers at submission , and editors prepare a final list ) . Second , women might have declined invita - tions more often than men . We found that the first reason contributed more to the discrepancy . Female first authors suggested female reviewers 21 % of the time ( n = 13 , 279 ) ; men suggested women just 15 % of the time ( n = 47 , 236 ) . Unsurprisingly , whatever their gender , authors suggested reviewers in their 20s only 1 % of the time . AGU editors invited just under one - third ( 29 % ) of the author - recommended review - ers . Female editors recommended female reviewers 22 % of the time versus 17 % for male editors . Editors of both sexes were slightly more likely to invite the youngest reviewers ( 3 % of all recommendations ) . Of these young invitees , only 32 % asked by female editors and 31 % asked by male edi - tors were women . This is lower than for the AGU membership or distinct published first authors . Recall : these differences did not translate into any sig - nificant differences in the decisions on man - uscripts . Why authors and editors , especially men , don’t suggest women to review may reflect a number of factors , but it is often attributed at least in part to implicit bias 1 , 10 . Women of almost every age declined their ( fewer ) invitations at a slightly higher rate than men in the same age group ( except those over the age of 80 ) . The differences were sta - tistically significant for all ages except the 60s and 80s cohorts . For example , the decline rate for women was 22 % , versus 17 % for men aged 20 – 30 . Decline rates for both genders increased with age , although older cohorts included fewer women and proportionally more older men were asked to review . There - fore , the overall decline rate did not differ sig - nificantly . Thus , we do not believe that this results in a negative feedback loop , in which editors don’t invite female reviewers because of they expect them to say ‘no’ . The main reason scientists gave for refus - ing was their workload . The differences apparent in certain age groups could arise from the fact that women are more likely to be involved in other service activities at their institutions and to shoulder a greater burden of family and other social duties . The differ - ences may also reflect varying approaches to risk or confidence 2 . WHAT NEXT The AGU is similar to many other large scientific societies . Thus we suggest that these results are broadly representative of gender and age differences across scholarly publishing , as well as grant evaluation . Other societies , funders and publishers should per - form similar audits . Participation as a reviewer for papers and grants has many benefits , particularly for early - career scientists . It is a chance to develop a relationship and make a positive impression with an editor , review - panel member or pro - gramme manager , who are typically senior scientists and are in turn likely to be involved in evaluating the reviewer’s future papers and grants . The same relationships can be built with authors if the review is not anonymous ( many at AGU are not ) or the reviewer identi - fies themselves later to the authors . Reviews can also foster later collaborations ( something not possible with double - blind reviews ) . Reviewing also offers an important learn - ing experience and a view of unpublished science , and helps improve communication and thinking . It provides positive feedback that a scholar is respected and participating in their field and fosters self - confidence , all of which lead to increased retention of women in geoscience 2 . Increasingly , there is a call to appreciate the time and effort that goes into reviewing . Hence reviewing his - tory is important in recognition in societies or appointments as editors . Hiring more female editors has helped the AGU to mitigate the disparity in recommen - dations . Publishers should consider further ways to train and educate their staff in com - bating bias . Encouraging authors and editors to invite more women to review , especially younger women , would be a start 11 . Fund - ing agencies should similarly examine their practices . We encourage organizations and individuals to consider how the structures that propagate gender bias might affect other under - represented groups . ■ Jory Lerback is a graduate student at the University of Utah , Salt Lake City , Utah , USA , and was previously a data analyst at the American Geophysical Union .
