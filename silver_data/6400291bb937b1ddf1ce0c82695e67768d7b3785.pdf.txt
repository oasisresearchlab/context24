Duisberg ABSTRACTS OF ARTICLES Volume 3 , Number 1 , 1987 - 198 8 A Language / Action Perspective on the Design of Cooperative Work Terry Winograd In creating computer - based systems , we wor k within a perspective that shapes the desig n questions that will be asked and the kinds of solutions that are sought . This article introduces a perspective based on language as action , an d explores its consequences for system design . We describe a communication tool called Th e Coordinator , which was designed from a language / action perspective ; and we suggest ho w further aspects of coordinated work might b e addressed in a similar style . The language / action perspective is illustrated with an example based o n studies of nursing work in a hospital ward an d contrasted to other currently prominen t perspectives .
