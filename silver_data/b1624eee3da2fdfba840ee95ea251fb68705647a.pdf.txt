Keywords Teamwork data · Teamwork evaluation · Microworlds · Design science 1 Introduction and motivation This paper discusses the challenges of conducting research intoteamworkandthehugepotentialbroughtbymicroworlds in helping us understand ﬁrst , how teams perform when exe - cuting a common task , and second , in particular , what impact groupware support has on teamwork . To clarify the research context , we deﬁne team as a set of two or more people , who are interdependent , have a common set of goals and perform activities in the context of a common task [ 1 ] . We deﬁne teamwork as a construct that involves a set of behaviours and attitudes that occur as team members perform a collective task , whichmaybesupportedbygroupwaretools [ 2 ] . Finally , we regard groupware as a class of software tools supporting small teams through information - based and communication technologies [ 3 ] . Ideally , research into teamwork would involve theory building and testing using widely accepted methods , vari - ables and data gathering instruments . Though , historically , this has rarely been the case . Research in this ﬁeld reﬂects a long - lasting division between technologists and social sci - entists [ 4 , 5 ] . In particular , Jacovi et al . [ 4 ] note the lack of citations across the two different groups , while Grudin and Poltrock [ 5 ] observe the lack of appreciation for theory and methods developed from each side of the fence . 123 1638 Cluster Comput ( 2017 ) 20 : 1637 – 1659 These differences naturally extend beyond theory and methods towards more speciﬁc issues such as research design and evaluation . For instance , even though a wide range of evaluation methods have been developed for teamwork , they usually fall into one of two categories : design - oriented and behaviour - oriented [ 4 , 6 ] . Design - oriented methods typically have a strong focus on the suitability of a speciﬁc technology to support teamwork . Reﬂecting their origins in computer science , the scope of the variables in play when evaluating teamwork is usually nar - row . For instance , many design - oriented studies are done in controlled settings , using highly constrained apparatus and speciﬁc scenarios and tasks [ 7 ] . Some design - oriented meth - ods are completely centred on formative evaluation , often done in very early stages of development , and therefore do not address aspects of collaboration other than technology use [ 8 ] . Popular methods such as iterative prototyping and heuristic evaluation fall into this category [ 9 ] . By contrast , behaviour - oriented methods adopt the view that social , cultural , workplace , and organizational factors are determinant variables in play when evaluating teamwork . According to this perspective , evaluations should be con - ducted under conditions that are representative of actual , naturalistic work settings [ 10 ] . They should also address a rich set of independent , intervening , extraneous , and depen - dent variables . Typical examples include ﬁeld studies and evaluativeethnography , whichconsideraspectssuchassocial and physical settings , emergent behaviour , and work contin - gencies [ 11 ] . In practice , closing the divide between design - oriented and behaviour - oriented evaluation is a very difﬁcult endeav - our . First , a fundamental reason is that the ﬁeld lacks unifying theory . Second , an even more complicated reason is the dif - ferent epistemological assumptions about what theory is , in spite of important advancements brought by design science [ 12 ] and discussions on the nature of theory from a design perspective [ 13 , 14 ] . Third , unifying the ﬁeld requires bringing together the wide range of factors involved in the phenomenon of interest into a conceptual framework . Such a framework would have to address various aspects such as the teams’ characteristics and dynamics , the social and organisational context in which teams are inserted , the diversity of tasks assigned to teams , the positive and negative effects of technology on the team’s tasks and processes , and of course the impact of technology design . Under this umbrella , we would have to speciﬁ - cally account for the multiplicity of factors constraining the teams’ performance , such as human – human communication , human – technology interaction , coordination , collaboration , information sharing , visualisation , task and team awareness , and decision - making , just to mention a few . Unfortunately , in this paper we do not propose such a uni - fying framework . Our discussion is less ambitious and really targeted at just one small part of the problem : data gather - ing . In particular , we discuss data gathering at the different granularity levels necessary to investigate teamwork . 1 . 1 Data gathering problem Data gathering is a fundamental component of any study . Though , deciding what data to gather in a study address - ing teamwork seems to be particularly challenging for researchers . Firstly , data gathering must focus on a set of variables that are explicitly conceptualised , deﬁned , mea - sured and inter - related . Prior research shows that using an incomplete set of variables often leads to conﬂicting results . For instance , a meta - review of experimental studies in the area of group decision - making attributed conﬂicting results to a generalised lack of consideration for contextual ( e . g . team composition and tools ) and intervening variables ( e . g . task , process structure , and communication mode ) [ 15 ] . Prior research also highlights that teams may activate different cognitive processing levels depending on task context , exper - tise level , social and organizational norms , and established practices [ 16 – 18 ] . Thus the consideration of context - related variables and their impact on data gathering is part of the problem . Secondly , many of the variables considered of interest for teamwork research are difﬁcult to examine directly . These include , for instance , situation awareness , mental workload , sensemaking and decision - making [ 19 – 21 ] . In these cases , one may have to add different data gathering methods to the mix , e . g . combining usage logs with queries to the partic - ipants about the values of various state parameters before , during and after performing a task [ 22 , 23 ] . Thirdly , as previously noted , a signiﬁcant portion of research into teamwork is centred on the design and devel - opment of software tools and applications . According to the design science paradigm [ 12 ] , researchers are involved in iterative cycles of artefact development and validation , which emphasise formative approaches to evaluation [ 24 ] . However , it seems difﬁcult to reconcile the understanding of teamwork as a complex phenomenon with the adoption of iterative , necessarily low - cost , approaches to data gathering [ 6 ] . Finally , if we combine the issues related to context , method diversiﬁcation and iteration , with the consideration that teams are often entangled in multiple , concurrent interac - tion patterns , moving swiftly between the individual , group and sub - group spheres , we can easily assert there are sig - niﬁcant difﬁculties aggregating data in meaningful ways for research . The acquired data may pertain to different domains ( e . g . social , cognitive and technological ) , encompass differ - ent viewpoints ( e . g . qualitative and quantitative ) , targets ( e . g . team and individuals ) , scales ( e . g . events occurring in sec - onds , minutes and hours ) , timeframes ( e . g . before , during 123 Cluster Comput ( 2017 ) 20 : 1637 – 1659 1639 and after accomplishing a task ) , sizes ( e . g . , a few pieces of data vs . other very large log ﬁles or other data ) and research goals ( e . g . formative and summative ) . All in all , developing data gathering instruments capable of spanning such a wide range of requirements and con - straints seems to be a meritorious research endeavour in itself . Our research addresses these challenges by adopting a microworld approach to teamwork data gathering . 1 . 2 Microworlds as an approach to the problem Microworlds are task - oriented , synthetic environments used to study human behaviour in quasi - naturalistic scenarios [ 25 ] . Two relevant examples consider experimental research on ﬁnancial decision - making and train driving . In the ﬁrst case , the microworld consisted of an auction game where traders would be able to buy and sell goods in multiple rounds with increasing difﬁculty [ 26 ] . This microworld supported research on the participants’ decision - making capabilities under increasing stress based on questionnaires delivered after the game , eyetracker logging data and video recording . In the second case , a microworld was designed to mimic the dynamic work environment of a single train driver , includ - ing control interfaces , warning messages , alarms , etc . [ 27 ] . This microworld was then used to analyse the drivers’ per - formance when facing interface designs representing the task in different ways . Measures of speed , time keeping , energy efﬁciency , attentional capacity and workload were used in the study . Microworlds are often scrutinised regarding the validity of the variables they operationalize . In general , microworlds are recognised as having high face validity [ 28 ] , i . e . their measures are assumed to be valid as they exhibit a pragmatic , common - sense relationship with the external variables being studied [ 29 ] . They are also seen as halfway between inter - nal and external validity : external validity ( measures valid outside the experiment ) is high because of the realism of the task , while internal validity ( measures caused by indepen - dent variables ) is also high because of the degree of control over certain variables [ 30 ] . Since external validity is a fundamental requirement of naturalistic research [ 31 ] and internal validity is a tenet of experimental research [ 30 ] , microworlds end up balancing the characteristics of both types of studies [ 32 ] . In fact , prior studies support the hypothesis that microworlds pro - vide reliability and internal validity of performance measures [ 33 , 34 ] , even though later studies suggest the difﬁculty level of microworlds may decrease external validity [ 28 ] . Based on this apparent capacity to balance competing views over research , we suggest that microworlds may con - tribute to a consensus around what data to gather in teamwork studies . We also suggest that addressing the data gathering problem requires an infrastructure capable of gathering a large amount of data from multiple sources , as well as cop - ing with different levels of detail and formalisation , different time / space frames , and related to contextual variables , all of which seem feasible in microworlds [ 35 ] . Acknowledging that teamwork research endeavours require that data gathering leads to representative informa - tion unveiling the underlying phenomenon . That brings the need for the ability to systematically collect multidimen - sional data , and moreover , in some dimensions , the power to collect data volume . With the lack of a uniﬁed theory , data gathering posit several challenges that we identify as dichotomous tensions in Sect . 2 . As introduced , we root our proposal for dealing with data gathering requirements , on the microworld paradigm given is inherent quasi - naturalistic orientation for teamwork enactment , while maintaining nev - ertheless , some degree of control over the data gathering process towards internal and external validity . We consequently frame our overarching research goal as : to develop a foundational set of building blocks guiding the development of microworlds as a data - gathering instrument for teamwork studies . We document the development of these building blocks using the case study approach . The overall organization and rationale of the paper is provided below . The next section discusses a set of fundamental ten - sions related to data gathering in the teamwork domain . Sect . 3 overviews the role of microworlds in supporting that endeavour . A set of requirements for data gathering with microworlds is developed in Sect . 4 . Framed by this set of requirements , some fundamental building blocks for data gathering with microworlds are proposed in Sect . 5 . Sec - tion 6 describes a study investigating teamwork using the proposed microworld . The study investigated the impact of a groupware tool designed to support teams performing a task related to infrastructure maintenance : handling disrup - tive events in network infrastructures . The study highlights how teamwork studies often involve the collection and anal - ysis of big data . Details from the experimental results are also provided in Sect . 6 . Section 7 discusses the role of microworlds in teamwork evaluation . Finally , in Sect . 8 we summarise the research , provide some concluding remarks and point future work directions . 2 Tensions in data gathering A fundamental principle of empirical science is to determine the fate of theoretical propositions based on test results [ 36 ] . However , many different methods can be adopted to obtain test results , which often reﬂect different epistemologies and methodologies [ 37 ] . In particular , the investigation of team - work is characterised by a notable diversity of views about what data should be collected and how it should be collected , which reﬂect different foundations in psychology , cogni - 123 1640 Cluster Comput ( 2017 ) 20 : 1637 – 1659 tive science , computer science , and social science [ 4 , 6 , 38 ] . Several considerations have to be made to frame the data gathering process in a way that is at the same time valid ( according to the requirements of each research community ) , efﬁcient ( from the researcher’s point of view ) , effective ( con - sidering data quality ) and reliable ( considering the research design ) . We expand the framework developed by Pinelle and Gutwin [ 39 ] by identifying several tensions that should be considered when gathering teamwork data . Table 1 shows these tensions as semantic differentials highlighting estab - lished viewpoints . Tensions No . 1 and 2 address the classic qualitative – quantitative divide [ 37 ] , highlighting the dif - ferences between rigorous and relaxed manipulations , and controlled versus naturalistic settings , which are respectively typical of laboratory and ﬁeld studies . Tension No . 3 emphasises the researchers’ goals either gathering empirical data about team behaviour or gathering design - oriented data , which supports iterative development . Tension No . 4 acknowledges the individual and distributed dimensions of teamwork . Decisions about gathering data at individual or team levels usually imply using very different theoretical scaffolds . Finally , in tension No . 5 we acknowl - edge that gathering teamwork data involves logging both macro and micro activities . Along with each tension we provide a list of advantages and drawbacks that can be found in related literature . Overall , what we observe is that every choice pushes data gathering towards a different direction . There are 32 combinations of choices , and considering those combined choices and their implications is certainly one of the major reasons making the study of teamwork a complex endeavour . 3 The microworld approach in more detail In an attempt to bridge the gap between the overly con - trolled and the overly naturalistic approaches , a number of researchers in human factors and complex work environ - ments have been adopting the microworld approach . The term and early vision of the paradigm may be traced back to the work , in the 80s , of Seymour Papert and colleagues , MIT Media Labs cofounders [ 69 ] . Grounded on Piaget’s work on constructivist learning theories , Papert and colleagues created a Lisp - based environment : the Turtle Geometry . Children could use this environment to learn by exploring geometrical and mathematical problems through an elemen - tary language named Logo . Many more of these learning environments have emerged thereafter , sharing the paradigm of a delimited and constrained slice of reality designed as a safe place for exploring and learning . Today the paradigm has been extended to other appli - cations allowing the study of human behaviour on safe , synthetic , task - oriented environments operating in simulated conditions . When properly designed , microworlds hold some basic representative real - world characteristics while omitting other aspects deemed secondary for the purposes of the study , in order to keep some degree of control over some variables [ 70 ] . Moreover , microworld - based experiments are not usually long , expensive or resource demanding . Additionally , since they allow collecting large data sets with different granular - ity , it is possible to support summative evaluations as well as formative ones . They have been considered particularly perti - nent in domains where ﬁeld studies or full scope simulations present major challenges [ 71 , 72 ] . Indeed microworlds have been adopted in application domains like naval warfare [ 73 ] , industrial processes control [ 74 ] , air trafﬁc control [ 75 ] , and ﬁre - ﬁghting [ 76 ] . Additionally , they have supported research on complex phenomena such as dynamic decision - making [ 77 ] , naturalistic decision - making [ 78 ] , and learning [ 79 ] , thus covering a wide range of variables related to teams . Furthermore , some studies in the training arena , using sophisticated environments , have yielded successful out - comes , as is the case of the Aspire + Packet Tracer [ 80 ] . It supports a microworld based training and evaluation program in the computer networks domain for professional compli - ance with the international Cisco Network Academy global program . In fact , the Aspire module overlaps the Packet Tracer existing network simulator , to furnish the overall accomplished microworld with some enhanced face valid - ity and gamiﬁcation ﬂavour , intended to favour learning and assessment realism . This is an emergent trend , which posits that microworlds are complemented with , and may constitute a type of , serious game , where “serious” has been coined given the designated primary purpose other than pure entertainment . Generally , serious games refer to products used by industries like defense , education , scientiﬁc exploration , health care , emer - gency management , city planning , engineering , and politics [ 81 ] . Another pragmatic example of gamiﬁcation in micro - worlds is the Foldit game , requiring players to learn to fold proteins using direct manipulation tools and user - friendly versionsofalgorithms .

[ 83 ] . Unfortunately , a common characteristic found in most microworlds developed to this day is they are tailor - made for each speciﬁc study . Even though each individual study contributes signiﬁcant knowledge to their speciﬁc domain , the knowledge about the microworld paradigm does not 123 Cluster Comput ( 2017 ) 20 : 1637 – 1659 1641 T a b l e 1 T e n s i on s i n d a t a g a t h e r i ng P e r s p ec ti v e a nd go a l s M a i n a dv a n t a g e s M a i n p r ob l e m s 1 R i go r ou s m a n i p u l a ti on G a t h e r d a t a i n t h e l a bo r a t o r y , t h r ough r i go r ou s c on t r o l ov e r t r ea t m e n t c ond iti on s a nd v a r i a b l e s [ 40 ] ; p r o m o t e ph e no m e n a m a n i f e s t a ti on s M a x i m i s e s , i n t e r n a l v a li d it y [ 40 ] ; s y s t e m a ti c v a li d a ti on o f hypo t h e s e s a nd t h e o r y d e v e l o p m e n t R e l e v a n ce i s h i gh l y c on s t r a i n e d by t h e a r ti ﬁ c i a lit y i m po s e d by l a bo r a t o r i a l s e tti ng s [ 41 ] ; o f t e n l ac k e x t e r n a l v a li d it y [ 40 ] M i n i m a l m a n i p u l a ti on C a p t u r e un s t r u c t u r e d d a t a fr o m t h e ﬁ e l d [ 42 ] O p e nn e ss , e xp l o r a ti on , n a t u r a l n e ss [ 43 ] I n t e r p r e ti v e n a t u r e o f d a t a a nd i n t e r - s ub j ec ti v it y o f d a t a ca p t u r e [ 42 ] ; m a y b e d i f ﬁ c u lt t o r i gh t f u ll y c on t r a s t ﬁ nd i ng s [ 44 ] 2 C on t r o ll e d s e tti ng U nd e r s t a nd t h e r e l a ti on s h i p s b e t w ee n d e p e nd e n t a nd i nd e p e nd e n t v a r i a b l e s [ 4 3 ] E li m i n a t e c on f ound i ng ph e no m e n a t h r ough i s o l a ti on [ 45 ] C a nno t b e a pp li e d t o ce r t a i n w o r k c on t e x t s , e . g . h i gh - r i s k s it u a ti on s [ 46 , 47 ] N a t u r a li s ti c s e tti ng U nd e r s t a nd ho w t ea m s m a k e d ec i s i on s i n r ea l - w o r l d s e tti ng s [ 48 ] E li m i n a t e t h e c on s t r a i n t s i m po s e d by l a bo r a t o r i a l s e tti ng s [ 49 ] D e p e nd e n ce on p r ac ti ca l p r ob l e m s r e l a t e d w it h t a s k a nd c on t e x t [ 50 ] 3 B e h a v i o u r V a li d a t e t h e o r i e s a nd m od e l s e xp l a i n i ng ho w hu m a n s b e h a v e [ 12 , 51 ] C o m p l e x p r o ce ss e s ca n b e a n a l y s e d w it h m e t hod s s u c h a s p r o ce ss t r ac i ng a nd c o mm un i ca ti o n a n a l y s i s [ 52 ] O u t c o m e s m a y no t d i r ec tl y t r a n s l a t e t o t ec hno l ogy d e v e l op m e n t [ 12 , 53 ] D e s i gn G a t h e r p r a g m a ti c l e ss on s f r o m it e r a ti v e d e s i gn [ 12 , 54 ] V a li d a ti on t h r ough u tilit y a ss e ss m e n t [ 54 ] O u t c o m e s r e l y m o r e on c o mm on s e n s e t h a n f u ll y a r ti c u l a t e d r e s ea r c h hypo t h e s i s [ 55 ] 4 I nd i v i du a l s H u m a n s a s i n f o r m a ti on p r o ce ss i ng m ac h i n e s [ 56 ] S t ud i e s o f i nd i v i du a l c ogn iti v e f un c ti on s h a v e b ee n e n r i c h i ng t h e w a y w e und e r s t a nd hu m a n b e h a v i ou r [ 57 , 58 ] T h e f o c u s on i nd i v i du a l s m i ss e s m u c h o f t h e ac t u a l t ea m c ogn iti on [ 59 ] T ea m s E xp a nd ou r v i e w fr o m i nd i v i du a l s t o t h e r e l a ti on s b e t w ee n i nd i v i du a l s a nd t h e e nv i r on m e n t w h e r e t h e y op e r a t e [ 60 , 61 ] B e tt e r / b r o a d l y c o rr e l a t e i nd i v i du a l d ec i s i on s t o t h e i r ac ti on s [ 62 ] M a ny c o m p li ca ti ng f ac t o r s i n t r odu ce d by t h e ae ti o l ogy o f t ea m ’ s dyn a m i c s [ 63 ] a nd c on t e x t [ 39 ] 5 M ac r o E v a l u a t e c o m p l e x t a s k s a t a m ac r o s ca l e o f p e rf o r m a n ce [ 64 , 65 ] R e s ea r c h on m i c r o ph e no m e n a l ac k s c o rr e s p ond e n ce w it h t h e s ca l e w h e r e t ea m s p e rf o r m c o m p l e x t a s k s [ 66 , 67 ] S it u a t e d n a t u r e , d e p e nd e n t on c on c r e t e s it u a ti on s [ 45 ] ; p r i m a r y e m ph a s i s b ea r s on e xp e r t s [ 68 ] M i c r o U nd e r s t a nd ho w c o m p l e x c ogn iti v e ph e no m e n a a r e e n t a ng l e d r e g a r d i ng t h e t a s k e x ec u ti on [ 45 ] A ll o w p r ec i s e c on t r o l a nd m ea s u r e m e n t [ 45 ] ; t h e m o r e w e r e du ce ph e no m e n a i n t o e l e m e n t a r y c o m pon e n t s t h e m o r e g e n e r a l w ill b e t h e p r i n c i p l e s [ 45 ] S o m e c ogn iti v e ph e no m e n a a r e d i f ﬁ c u lt t o e x a m i n e d i r ec tl y [ 19 ] ; p r i m a r y e m ph a s i s on r ou ti n e t a s k s [ 68 ] 123 1642 Cluster Comput ( 2017 ) 20 : 1637 – 1659 evolve correspondingly because studies usually do not regard microworlds as a phenomenon of interest . In particular , a tailor - made approach makes it more difﬁcult to standardise the instrument , considering for instance the balance between internal and external validity , the data and contextual infor - mation that should be gathered , what constraints to data gathering have to be considered , and their implications to theory building and theory testing . Next , we elaborate upon a list of requirements that would contribute to standardising the use of microworlds in teamwork studies . 4 Requirements for teamwork evaluation using microworlds We can now consider in more detail the possibilities brought by microworlds put forward in Sect . 3 in relation with the ten - sions discussed in Sect . 2 . Microworlds , because of their semi open / closed nature , can combine laboratory experiments ( rigorous , controlled ) with ﬁeld observations ( naturalistic , minimal manipulation ) , thus resolving tensions No . 1 and 2 . This semi open / closed nature comes from the support to unpredictable behaviour while still controlling and monitor - ing the participants’ interactions [ 84 ] . Microworlds may also support the simultaneous eval - uation of technology designs and team behaviour , thus resolving tension No . 3 . The key issues of tensions No . 4 and 5 concern the capacity to analyse teamwork at individual and team levels by gathering data with different granularity . Since microworlds usually mediate all team / user interactions , they represent an ideal vehicle for overcoming the main problems raised by tensions No . 4 and 5 . From this match between ten - sions in data gathering and speciﬁc affordances brought by microworlds , we have derived a set of functional require - ments to inform a generic teamwork evaluation platform using microworlds . 4 . 1 R1—Control external events This is related to experimental rigor and control noted in ten - sions No . 1 and 2 . The goal is balancing the teams’ capacity to make decisions as if in a naturalistic setting with the capacity to capture behavioural data in a rigorous and controlled way . This involves controlling the injection of external events in the experimental scenarios , promoting context changes and unexpected reactions . 4 . 2 R2—Mediate human – human , human – technology , and human – environment interactions This requirement concerns tensions No . 2 , 3 and 4 . A key characteristic of teamwork is interaction , and a key goal of behavioural studies is examining interaction patterns . Three types of interaction are considered : human – human ( H – H ) , human – technology ( H – T ) and human – environment ( H – E ) . H – H interaction involves information sharing , coordination and decision - making support , and other communication - based phenomena among humans . H – T interaction concerns the use of support tools . Teams often use generic tools like social media software and shared editors . They also use specialised tools designed to support work on the domain . Human interaction with these tools should be con - sidered / captured within the context of the external events by the platform . H – E interaction considers the physical reality over which teams operate . Teams interact with the elements of their operational physical reality in various dimensions , either mediated through technological systems or directly toward physical elements / resources . An example of the latter is the interaction with elements in the physical world such as mechanical levers . The work setting may also impose con - straints that bound physical activities . These interactions can be simulated by the microworld platform in various ways . For example , adopting sophisticated immersion mechanisms to mimic the affordances of the real world , as seen in ﬂight simulators . Other approaches with relaxed face validity may be considered depending on the evaluation purposes and the extent of its coupling with phenomena of interest [ 85 ] . 4 . 3 R2 . 1—Human – human interactions Interactions in the real world occur through different modal - ities , most often face - to - face , but video , radio , phone , chatting , e - mailing , and messaging are also common . The platform should reproduce the main characteristics of these modalities and in particular should preserve their one - to - one , one - to - many or many - to - many capabilities . Gathering data according to these modalities is paramount because it affords data richness so necessary to analyse teamwork . Most often an interesting facet of research derives from the analysis of teams’ communicational modalities preferences and patterns according to context and exchanged items . 4 . 4 R2 . 2—Human – technology interactions As noted above , the platform should also support the evalua - tion of the envisioned technology design options , considering in particular the functional features . To accomplish this goal , the platform requires a model and interface of the technology being evaluated . Then , the platform should gather data about every human – technology interaction down to the keystroke level . 123 Cluster Comput ( 2017 ) 20 : 1637 – 1659 1643 4 . 5 R2 . 3—Human – environment interactions The platform must consider two constructs related to the physical environment : locations and work elements . Loca - tions are necessary to model teamwork done in multiple distributed physical places , while work elements provide simulators for the relevant physical interactions with phys - ical world elements , e . g . operations on a physical machine . Then , the platform should gather data about state changes related to locations and all interactions with work elements . 4 . 6 R3—Data gathering must be contextualised at both macro and micro levels Considering that teamwork is open and dynamic , with multiple external events injected over time and multiple inter - actions occurring in parallel , data logs can be quite difﬁcult to analyse . The problem is even more relevant when exten - sive data is gathered at both macro and micro levels . So an important requirement is keeping a coherent view of the rela - tionships between the captured data and the environmental and task conditions triggered during the evaluation . 4 . 7 R3 . 1—Behavioural data must be complemented with direct user inquiries Even though capturing all user interactions in the microworld already supplies a large amount of data necessary to research teamwork , in many studies that is not enough . Phenomena such as situation awareness , attention , stress , decision - making , and information overload can hardly be inferred from interaction data alone and thus require other com - plementary data gathering sources . Several complementary approaches can be used , such as debrieﬁngs and talk - aloud protocols . Nevertheless , the approach that seems more in line with our perspective is inquiring the users through freeze - probe questionnaires . The main idea is prompting users with some questions before , during or after the task . 5 Proposed microworld architecture We now put forward a set of building blocks for develop - ing a microworld for teamwork evaluation . In Fig . 1 we overview the proposed logical architecture , which is directly derived from the requirements presented in Sect . 4 . The pro - posed architecture has four main components : operational work environment simulator ( OWES ) , team communication ( TC ) , questionnaires manager ( QM ) , and experimental con - trol manager ( ECM ) . OWES supports virtual representations of the work envi - ronment over which teams perform their tasks . Its main purpose is to provide the means necessary to simulate real - world activities in the virtualised environment . Since communication is a fundamental asset of teamwork , TC is dedicated to support several communication modalities used bytheteam . TheintegrationofQMinthemicroworldisbased on the fact that questionnaires have been widely adopted to Fig . 1 Proposed microworld architecture 123 1644 Cluster Comput ( 2017 ) 20 : 1637 – 1659 Fig . 2 OWES—operational work environment simulator model implement freeze probes . Finally , ECM oversees the experi - mental process , focusing on task assignment and control . Each of these components is further described in the fol - lowing subsections . 5 . 1 Operational work environment simulator ( OWES ) The main goal of OWES is to simulate real - world physical elements , their affordances and the actions that users can do on them . The deﬁnition of both elements and actions to be accommodated in a synthetic representation of the work envi - ronment is inevitably dependent on the speciﬁc application domain and simulation purposes [ 86 ] . For instance , simulat - ing an online market will necessarily be very different from simulating a ﬁreﬁght . Though in Fig . 2 we elaborate a domain independent model of OWES ( using the UML notation ) . The model deﬁnes three abstract classes : operational work environment locations ( OWEL ) , operational work environment affordable action types ( OWEAAT ) , and operational work environment elements ( OWEE ) . Being abstract classes ( in the UML mod - elling sense ) , they are not intended to be directly realized by an implementation , but to provide guidance for development onspeciﬁcapplicationdomains . Mostimportantly , theyspec - ify what data will be captured by the microworld in relation with the work setting , i . e . elements , locations and actions . OWEL represents physical locations , e . g . ﬁelds , rooms and buildings . While working in the ﬁeld , team members can perform a myriad of location - based actions like mov - ing around and arriving to a certain place , which should be logged . OWEE models physical elements of the work envi - ronment , like equipment and tools . OWEAAT represents the set of actions that can be associated to each element deﬁned in the work setting . Relying on the UML abstraction relationship , which deﬁnes dependencies between model elements at differ - ent levels of abstractions , the proposed model uses the (cid:2)(cid:2) reﬁne (cid:3)(cid:3) dependency to show that an OWEE deﬁnition is accomplished by three constituents : properties , actions and dynamics . The scope and level of detail of OWEE properties are bounded by domain requirements regarding face validity : if high face validity is required , then the OWEE properties must account for ﬁne - grained attributes such as size , shape and colour ; conversely , if face validity can be relaxed , then those properties may not be speciﬁed and the OWEE repre - sentation may be simpler and more abstract [ 85 ] . The speciﬁcation of actions is of paramount importance in a synthetic environment , since they deﬁne what the team members can do with the elements of the work setting . In the proposed architecture , we deﬁne two types of action : probe operations ( e . g . checking the status of a device , where blue means it is working and read means it failed ) , and opera - tive actions ( e . g . restarting and unplugging a device ) . We additionally note that some OWEE may require the consid - eration of their intrinsic dynamics in order to reproduce real world behaviour ( e . g . how some properties change through time and / or in respect to interactions between OWEEs or OWEAA ) . The OWES speciﬁcation uses a state space approach . State spaces have been used in software engineering for specifying high - level conceptual requirements and rigorously inform design and implementation [ 87 , 88 ] . Buchner and Funke [ 89 ] highlight four strengths of state spaces . First , they afford a rigorous , systematic and reusable formulation of synthetic environments . Second , by representing an environment with a set of internal states , they smoothly accommodate the manipulation of states to promote the manifestations of phe - nomena of interest , which is paramount given our purposes . 123 Cluster Comput ( 2017 ) 20 : 1637 – 1659 1645 Third , since the elements speciﬁed in OWES may them - selvesbedescribedwithstatespaces , therepresentationofthe overall environment contributes to internal validity . Fourth , considering that in complex dynamic scenarios users con - tinuously interact with OWEE , framing these interactions within the state space provides a white - box view over the users’ interactions , which in turn allows capturing data about every action performed by users within the environmental context . The deﬁnition of an OWEE state is based on a set of properties - domain values . State transitions are accomplished by three means : ( 1 ) derived from methods implemented by OWEE objects ( internal dynamics ) ; ( 2 ) stemmed from user interactions with OWEE objects ( team dynamics , which is not modelled ) ; and ( 3 ) derived by ripple effects affecting sev - eral OWEE objects , where a state change in an object causes a state change in other objects . Furthermore , state changes in OWEE objects may also be caused by the injection of external events . Given the above considerations one may note that , although an OWES state space collection depends on the application domain , if care is taken on the implementation then a state space engine will be largely reusable across mul - tiple application domains . 5 . 2 Team communication ( TC ) Team communication may take several forms considering established team practices and available mediation tools . Taylor et al . [ 90 ] studied how teams adapt to dynamic tasks , and found that most effective teams exhibit speciﬁc commu - nication patterns aimed at supporting the information needs of the team and its individual members . Citera et al . [ 91 ] and Klein [ 92 ] also point out that efﬁcient teams have high levels of communication to improve situation awareness and track other team members’ activities . A number of application domains such as air trafﬁc control [ 93 ] , control rooms [ 94 ] , emergency dispatch [ 95 ] , ﬁre - ﬁghting [ 96 ] , and network troubleshooting [ 97 ] , where teamwork is time - critical , recognize the important role of speech communication . Field studies involving mobile pro - fessionals , like service technicians [ 98 ] , police patrols [ 99 ] , and ﬁre - ﬁghters [ 100 ] also suggest that collaboration in these settings is primarily supported by speech . As a consequence , gathering details about the speech communications done by teams is of paramount importance to study teamwork . For that reason , we propose that all team communica - tions have to be mediated by the microworld , which will log every event . This constraint applies in particular to face - to - face - communication . Therefore the proposed TC component includes a sub - component named Speech communications ( SC ) . SC supports three communication modes : one - to - one , one - to - many and many - to - many . These modes address typ - ical types of speech communication such as phone calls , conference and radio calls . Besides speech communication , teams may also commu - nicate using various types of tools sharing text , pictures , etc . Onceagain , inordertostudyteamwork , onehastogatherdata about these communication events , which in turn requires all groupware - based communications done by the team to be mediated by the microworld . Therefore , the proposed TC also includes a sub - component named groupware emulator ( GE ) . The speciﬁc characteristics of the GE component can - not be detailed , since they are speciﬁc to the tools adopted by each team . So the GE is just an architectural placeholder , which is responsible for logging tool - based events , which in turn have to be speciﬁed on a case - by - case basis . Moreover , one further aspect that has to be considered about the GE is that the groupware tools may not actually exist . That is , the GE may be used as a proxy for evaluating design features of early conceptual prototypes . The functional implementation of the GE is naturally dependent on the particular groupware or conceptual fea - ture that is considered by a research study . Thus we can say that the GE component has a lesser overall reusability than the SC , which may be used across multiple studies . 5 . 3 Questionnaires manager ( QM ) Studies in human cognition often rely on the administration of questionnaires to understand the phenomenon of interest . In the speciﬁcation of QM we consider three main aspects constrainingtheadministrationofquestionnairestotheteam : ( 1 ) the moment at which the questionnaires are administered to the team ; ( 2 ) the extent that questionnaires are aligned with the users’ operational context ; and ( 3 ) the extent that answers to questionnaires contribute to analyse behaviour at both the individual and the team levels . Regarding the ﬁrst issue , we note freeze probes can be problematic because they intrude the users’ primary task [ 101 ] . Post - trial questionnaires are less intrusive , but on the other hand may be less sensitive to the phenomenon of inter - est , since users may rationalize their performance . QM may be conﬁgured to prescribe pre - trial , post - trial or freeze probe questionnaires . The latter considers freezing the primary task at a certain point in time to administer a ques - tionnaire to users . Furthermore , considering the amount and types of data collected by the microworld , the QM compo - nent can be conﬁgured to trigger individual questionnaires , which are triggered after the occurrence of a speciﬁc event or a certain number of actions performed by the user on a OWEE object . Regarding the alignment between the questionnaires and the users’ operational context , we observe that , since the microworld traces all users’ actions within the environment’s state space , it is possible to dynamically generate a ques - 123 1646 Cluster Comput ( 2017 ) 20 : 1637 – 1659 Fig . 3 Instantiation of the microworld architecture tionnaire that accounts for the users’ speciﬁc operational contexts . This important feature contributes to capturing teamwork data in context . Finally , we note that the QM can be reused across different studies , since only the questions delivered to users must be tailored to each speciﬁc study . 5 . 4 Experimental control manager ( ECM ) Microworlds , as laboratory instruments , must control the experimental conditions . This involves an integrated control of its constituents , OWES , TC , and QM components , conﬁg - uring and , enabling or constraining their functional features . As an example , we bring up the set of experiments described in Sect . 6 , which compare team performance under two con - ditions , one relying on phone calls to accomplish a task , and another one using a collaborative tool in addition to phone calls . In this particular case , SC was conﬁgured to operate in the one - to - one mode , and GE was enabled for one group of users and disabled for the control group . Another paramount requirement underlying the ECM component is to accommodate multiple task scenarios , i . e . multiple manipulations of OWES that are intended to pro - mote the manifestation of a phenomenon of interest . The representation of task scenarios relies on an event - driven logic , which combines a set of external events with the state space deﬁned in OWEE . By adding external events , which disrupt the state space , we may intentionally lead the operational behaviour to depart from its expected dynamics towards unexpected behaviour [ 102 ] . The present characterization of task scenarios builds upon three main constituents . The ﬁrst one holds a description , in natural language of the task context that is conveyed to the team through the OWES graphical user interface . The sec - ond constituent is the set of initial states that the OWEE holds in order to reﬂect a purported task scenario . The third constituent holds the collection of events that will affect the OWES state space . Such events will override the OWEE state transitions deﬁned in the OWES engine state matrices at cer - tain points in time . 5 . 5 Architecture realisation Since the previous architecture description is abstract , we now provide additional details about its realisation . Figure 3 illustrates how we have instantiated the micro - world architecture . The instantiation adopted a client – server approach , where the server is responsible for all the microworld logic and data storage and the client - side pro - vides a set of four independent graphical user interfaces that give users access to a set of functions . Below we describe these instantiations in more detail emphasising the client – server relationships . 5 . 5 . 1 Speech communication ( SC ) Speech communication is realised by the SC component . From the server perspective , this component uses voice over the Internet protocol ( VoIP ) to mediate communication between team members . For users , SC provides a VoiceClient control panel that allows them to initiate a communication in either unicast or multicast modes . When the unicast mode is selected , the user can select the receivers from a menu show - ing the list of team members . Then the voice communication is controlled by pressing “Start” and “Finish” buttons . This realisation is generic and can be used in any study . 123 Cluster Comput ( 2017 ) 20 : 1637 – 1659 1647 5 . 5 . 2 Operational work environment simulator ( OWES ) This component holds the state space that describes the oper - ational behaviour of the microworld . The client side offers a TaskClient control panel that provides a set of operational possibilities mimicking some real - world characteristics of the operational environment . These include : ( 1 ) moving to a certain location ; and ( 2 ) checking and / or changing the sta - tus of an element deﬁned in the environment . When a user invokes one of these operations on the TaskClient panel , the server uses the state space to propagate state changes to every affected element . Even though the OWES supports three generic operations on the environment ( move , check and change status ) , the full realisation of this component may require specifying other operations relevant for the application domain and phenom - ena of interested being studied . Furthermore , the microworld has to be conﬁgured with speciﬁc sets of locations , elements of the environment , actions , dependencies between them , etc . Nonetheless , the abstract orientation provided by the pro - pose architecture , combined with state - space functionality , provide partial reusability of the OWES . 5 . 5 . 3 Groupware emulator ( GE ) The client - side of this component is realised by the Tool - Client control panel . This panel provides a set of user - interface controls that invoke groupware functions such as instant messaging and collaborative editing . The back - end component either simulates these functions or implements an application interface to the actual groupware tools . As such , its realisation is particular to the speciﬁc application domain and phenomena of interested being studied . 5 . 5 . 4 Questionnaires manager ( QM ) This component is realised through a FreezeProbeClient pop - up panel , which can be conﬁgured to prescribe a set of questions to the users . The FreezeProbeClient interacts with the server to collect information about the OWES state space , which may be necessary to contextualise the questions ( e . g . “you have already done operation X twice , please explain why” ) , and to display the questions and collect answers . This component can be conﬁgured regarding the type and timing or the triggering event . It can also be conﬁgured to collect various types of open and closed questions ( yes / no and multiple choice ) . Therefore , this realisation is generic and can be used in any study . In Table 2 we summarise the characteristics of the devel - oped platform components according to the controlled and naturalistic categories . We also highlight the reusability potential of each component .

The following section brieﬂy describes the study’s domain of application . Next , we describe how the microworld was applied in the case , and then discuss the obtained results . 6 . 1 Preliminary considerations Large and medium organisations usually need speciﬁc teams that take the responsibility to maintain information and com - munication technology ( ICT ) , handling failures , responding to clients’ requests , installing and conﬁguring technology , helping users , etc . These teams often have to collaborate to solve disruptive events , sometimes in multiple physical spaces . The primary goal of the case study was to design a mobile tool that would increase teams’ situation awareness . Various types of disruptive events may occur in ICT sys - tems , involving both hardware and software failures , which in turn may originate service - level failures . Some service failures may be regarded by organizations as very serious or even critical , since they may not only compromise the inter - nal operations but also service - level agreements with other organisations . During these events , the responding teams may have to adapt routines to better respond to emergent problems , time constrains , high stress levels , and improvisa - tion of containment and mitigation actions [ 103 ] . To better understand teamwork in these scenarios , we con - ducted several interviews and workshops with practitioners [ 104 , 105 ] . Fromthatstudy , weidentiﬁedaresearchgap : even though responding teams rely on well - known trouble ticket software to support more routine operations , such software was perceived as irrelevant in the support of non - routine sce - narios . In most cases , trouble tickets were just used to open an incident ; and occasionally they were used for post mortem annotations . However , trouble tickets were never used to sup - port teamwork during the events . Thus a design opportunity has been identiﬁed . Our main goal was then to design a groupware tool that would increase situation awareness by sharing up - to - date information about an on - going disruptive event , sharing information about the individual activities done to identify failures , and information necessary to coordinate the team and solve the problems . Consequently , we decided to design and develop a mobile tool supporting situation awareness [ 104 ] . The critical challenge though was evaluating the tool . The adoption of a laboratory approach to validate the tool seemed inadequate because the whole purpose of the tool was supporting teams in realistic , non - routine scenarios . Fur - thermore , data acquisition would have to range from micro to macro details , regarding both individual and team situation awareness . Validating such tool in the ﬁeld also seemed to have some drawbacks : ( 1 ) it required various people to gather data ; ( 2 ) the distributed work setting made it difﬁcult to co - relate the collected data ; ( 3 ) collecting such data during disruptive events also created logistic and organisational problems ; and ( 4 ) most importantly , since the tool design could evolve at any time , the whole data gathering effort seemed excessive when pondered against the exploratory nature of design . It was this context that justiﬁed using a microworld to evaluate the tool . 6 . 2 Realisation of the microworld architecture In Fig . 4 we illustrate the realisation of the OWES for this par - ticular case study . The top of Fig . 4 presents the TaskClient panel that was shown to each team member during the exper - iments . It shows that users can move between different rooms ( from A to E ) , can select devices available in each room ( e . g . room D has 5 computers and 2 routers ) , and can also operate these devices . For this particular application , the considered Fig . 4 Top TaskClient with a sample network loaded ; Bottom simu - lated respective network’s infrastructure 123 Cluster Comput ( 2017 ) 20 : 1637 – 1659 1649 Fig . 5 ToolClient— Top Situation - monitoring panel ; Bottom assign - ment panel operations were : check status , restart , update , replace and connect . The bottom of Fig . 4 illustrates the simulated network infrastructure . The state space deﬁned for this scenario has three types of environmental elements : computers , routers and servers . It also deﬁnes relationships between these ele - ments and several locations ( rooms A to E ) . Finally , each element may hold an overall state of “working” or “malfunc - tioning” , which can propagate to other dependent elements according to the network structure being simulated . The considered operational actions include : check status , restart , update , replace and connect to the network . It is also possible to move to a room where a set of elements was located . The simulation adds a certain amount of time to complete this action to simulate the cost of travelling around . In Fig . 5 we present the realisation of the GE for this case study . The ToolClient has two panels : assignment and situation monitoring . The assignment panel shows the tasks assigned to team members , while the situation - monitoring panel summarises the results from the checks done by team members ( after moving to a room and checking a device ) . In theassignmentpanel , ateammembercanalsoaskacolleague to check a device . We note again that the reusability of the abovementioned two components is low . They have to be developed for each speciﬁc case study . Though the microworld standardises data collection . In this particular case , data is gathered about every action done by the users on TaskClient and ToolClient . On the other hand , vanilla VoiceClient and FreezeProbe - Client components were used in the case study without any modiﬁcations . The VoiceClient was conﬁgured to simulate the use of mobile phone calls ( unicast ) . And the FreezeProbe - Client was conﬁgured to suspend the task at three points in time to prompt the team members about a set of task - related factors that would contribute to analyse situation awareness . More details about these questions are provided in the next section . 6 . 3 Experimental design The experimental design was focused on understanding the impact of the groupware tool on teamwork . More precisely , we were seeking to understand how the provision of up - to - date information to the team about assigned tasks and device checks affected the team . The fundamental phenomenon of interest was situation awareness , since it has been found to constitute a funda - mental team asset under demanding work settings [ 106 ] . Situation awareness is a complex construct with many differ - ent analytic lenses . Situation awareness is constructed from the continuous extraction of environmental information and the integration of such information with previous knowledge to form a coherent representation of a situation . Situation awareness guides action and helps make projections about how a situation may evolve [ 107 ] . These deﬁnitions bring out two dimensions traditionally consideredbyresearchinsituationawareness : ( 1 ) theproduct dimension , i . e . the information held in the individuals’ minds [ 108 ] ; and ( 2 ) the process dimension , which concerns the activities enacted by individuals to build situation awareness [ 109 ] . When analysing teams we should bring forward two addi - tional dimensions : ( 1 ) a shared dimension , which addresses the overlap of situation awareness among the team members [ 110 ] ; and ( 2 ) a distributed dimension , which regards sit - uation awareness as spread among the team members in a complementary way [ 111 ] . Measuring the phenomenon according to these different facets precludes different measurement techniques . While theproductandshareddimensionshavebeenmainlyassessed through the use of questionnaires [ 19 , 110 ] , the process and distributed dimensions have been studied using operational work tracing techniques [ 111 ] . A clear advantage of using a microworld in this case is that it supports gathering data related to these two different dimensions . Therefore in our 123 1650 Cluster Comput ( 2017 ) 20 : 1637 – 1659 experiments with the microworld we combined freeze probe questionnaires with activity logs . A repeated measurements design was adopted and each participating team was submitted to two experimental treat - ments . Given that the introduction of a groupware tool constituted the independent variable , the teams were subject to two sequential treatments assigned in random order : one having access to the groupware tool ( w / condition ) and the other without ( w / o condition ) , which served as control treat - ment . In each condition , teams performed ﬁrst a practice test with a different task scenario . The teams were assembled from ﬁnal year students of undergraduate courses in informatics . The selected team size considered three elements . Extra course credits and prize money were offered to the best performing teams to encour - age deep engagement with the tasks . The participants were informed that their performance was evaluated according to three main factors : time to accomplish the task , number of operations necessary to complete the task , and number of displacements over the ( virtual ) places necessary to com - plete the task . Only students that had successfully completed a course on computer networks were selected for the exper - iment , to ensure they were knowledgeable about the task . All participants signed consent forms and received brieﬁng materials and participated in brieﬁng sessions describing and clarifying the goals of the experiments and the type of task they had to accomplish . The experiments were done in two rounds , the ﬁrst one with 12 teams ( 36 participants ) and the second one with 11 teams ( 33 participants ) . There were several differences between the two rounds . Besides some minor changes related with the speciﬁc variables that were measured , the major change introduced in the second round was increasing the complexity of task , using a more complex network topology and more intricate failure modes . These changes required modiﬁcations to the OWES component of the microworld but did not affect the other components . In the following , we will only discuss results from the second round of exper - iments . Details about other rounds of experiments can be found in [ 104 ] . For each experimental treatment in the second round of experiments , the microworld was conﬁgured to freeze the task three times to administer a questionnaires with three questions gathering different data about situation awareness : ( 1 ) what is the current status of network device X ? ( aware - ness about the problem ) ( 2 ) where the other team members are located ? ( team awareness ) and ( 3 ) what are the under - lying causes of the problem ? ( awareness about the problem causes ) . Besides gathering data through the questionnaires , we also gathered data on the task completion times , speech commu - nications , actions done in the environment ( moving around and checking / operating devices ) , and operations done in the groupware tool ( assign teams to tasks and report device sta - tus ) . All that data was then analysed according to a set of measures described in more detail in the next section . 6 . 4 Experimental results and analysis Our discussion of the experimental results is mainly focussed on illustrating the capacity to analyse the range of data cap - turedbythemicroworld . Giventhatthegathereddatadoesnot follow a normal distribution , we rely on the non - parametric , distribution free Wilcoxon matched - pairs signed rank test [ 112 ] for assessing the statistical signiﬁcance of the results , considering the minimal threshold as 0 . 05 . We start by reporting on task completion times and num - ber of operations enacted by teams ( Table 2 ) . Regarding task completion times , teams in the w / condition took more time to complete the task , with an average of 2 more minutes when compared with the control group . These results were statisti - cally signiﬁcant . Though curiously the differences in number of operations performed by teams were not statistically sig - niﬁcant . We deﬁned individual awareness ( IA ) as the quotient between the number of correct answers to freeze probe ques - tionsandthetotalnumberofanswers , IA = # correct answers # answers . The results are presented in Table 3 . They show no statisti - cally signiﬁcant differences , although results for question 3 , which asked if the participants had a perception of the under - lying causes of the network problems , were on the threshold to signiﬁcance . We deﬁned team awareness ( TA ) as the quotient between the number of correct answers to freeze probe questions shared by pairs and triplets of participants , and the total num - ber of answers ( considering again pairs and triplets ) , TA = # correct answers shareled by pairs # questions shared by pairs + 2 3 # correct answers shared by pairs # questions shared by triplets + # correct answers shared by triplets # questions shared by triplets . The results obtained for team awareness , which are presented in Table 4 , also showed no signiﬁcant differences .

That measure corresponds to what we designate situation awareness improvement ratio ( SAIR ) , which is reported in Table 5 . This measure was deﬁned as the ratio between the IA measured in a freeze probe and the IA measured in the previous probe , for each question . A pos - itive value indicates the individual situation awareness has improved , while a negative value indicates it has decreased . As shown in Table 5 , these measures provided some statis - tically signiﬁcant differences . Considering Q1 , we note that individual team members increased situation awareness from the ﬁrst to the second probe , but from then on kept a similar level of awareness . Regarding Q2 , this measure suggests that awareness about the location of team members decreased as the task unfolded , eventhoughtheratiowaslesspronouncedinthew / condition . Considering Q3 , we note that gains in situation awareness were higher for the w / condition in the ﬁrst probe but then again reached a plateau , suggested by no statistical signif - icances between the two conditions in the transition from probe 2 to probe 3 . We also measured individual and team situation awareness based on the activities done by the participants to diagnose the problem . The individual diagnosis efﬁciency ( IDE ) is a quotient between redundant equipment checks and the total numberofchecks , IDE = 1 − # redundant equipment checks # equipment checks . The individual operational efﬁciency ( IOE ) is a quotient between redundant operations and the total number of oper - ations , IOE = 1 − # redundant operations # total operations . Team diagnosis efﬁciency ( TDE ) is the quotient between the number of redundant checks done by each member and the total number of checks done by the team , TDE = 1 − (cid:2) 3 i = 1 # redundant equipment checks of member ( i ) # equipment checks . Finally , team operational efﬁciency ( TOE ) is the quotient between the number of redundant actions done by each member and the total number of actions done by the team , TOE = 1 − (cid:2) 3 i = 1 # redundant operations of member ( i ) # operational actions . The obtained results , which are summarised in Table 6 , did not exhibit any signiﬁcant differences between conditions . Besides analysing activities , we also analysed the speech communication between team members ( Table 7 ) . Here , the results were more interesting . We identiﬁed signiﬁcant dif - ferences in two variables . One was the number of messages , where the teams not using the groupware tool exchanged more messages than the control teams . Since we could also classify the messages as either related to information sharing or team management , we could also analyse the differences between the two categories . The results show signiﬁcant dif - 123 1652 Cluster Comput ( 2017 ) 20 : 1637 – 1659 T a b l e 5 A v e r a g e s ( a nd s t a nd a r d d e v i a ti on s ) o f t ea m a w a r e n e ss ( T A ) f o r eac h qu e s ti on ( Q 1 – Q 3 ) a nd fr eeze p r ob e ( # 1 – # 3 ) C ond iti on T A — t ea m a w a r e n e ss Q 1 Q 2 Q 3 # 1 # 2 # 3 # 1 # 2 # 3 # 1 # 2 # 3 w / o 0 . 27 ( 0 . 36 ) 0 . 66 ( 0 . 29 ) 0 . 67 ( 0 . 21 ) 0 . 65 ( 0 . 21 ) 0 . 45 ( 0 . 19 ) 0 . 29 ( 0 . 17 ) 0 . 20 ( 0 . 11 ) 0 . 17 ( 0 . 14 ) 0 . 31 ( 0 . 23 ) w / 0 . 25 ( 0 . 22 ) 0 . 63 ( 0 . 33 ) 0 . 60 ( 0 . 26 ) 0 . 76 ( 0 . 24 ) 0 . 46 ( 0 . 21 ) 0 . 32 ( 0 . 21 ) 0 . 13 ( 0 . 13 ) 0 . 26 ( 0 . 13 ) 0 . 32 ( 0 . 13 ) p - v a l u e – ( N = 11 ) – ( N = 11 ) – ( N = 8 ) 0 . 109 ( N = 11 ) – ( N = 11 ) – ( N = 8 ) 0 . 203 ( N = 11 ) 0 . 139 ( N = 11 ) – ( N = 8 ) ferences in the number of messages exchanged for team management , where the teams using the groupware tool exchanged fewer messages than the control groups ( Table 8 ) . Overall , the obtained results suggest that the groupware tool slightly modiﬁed the team’s behaviour regarding infor - mation exchange : teams using the tool exchanged fewer messages , especially messages related to team management . Generally speaking , these results suggest the groupware tool did not increase either individual or team situation awareness . However , a more ﬁne - grained analysis of the three freeze probes showed that , for one speciﬁc type of awareness—awareness of the problem causes—the group - ware tool provided more awareness in the ﬁrst probe , but teams reached basically the same levels of awareness in the last probe . 7 Discussion The results from the case study indicate that the groupware tool changed the teams’ behaviour by decreasing the num - ber of exchanged messages related to team management . However , it did not increase situation awareness as primarily hypothesized . Reﬂecting on these results , it seems that adopt - ing situation awareness as a development goal and measure of success , was a poor choice . We optimistically assumed that increasing situation awareness was desirable , but instead the experimental results showed that the participants could actually fulﬁl the task with the existing level of situation awareness . Perhaps more dramatic was the realisation that our attempt at increasing situation awareness through the groupware tool had an actual cost , which resulted in teams spending more time to complete the task . This trade - off could then provide a rational explanation for the lack of signiﬁcant differences in the situation awareness measures . However , the team members were keen to change com - munication patterns when new groupware features were available . Using the groupware tool , the team members sig - niﬁcantly reduced voice communication . With hindsight , we realise the teams had a clear preference for reducing the amount of effort required to accomplish the task over increas - ing awareness about what was going on . The results from the case study suggest that future developments of the group - ware tool should focus on optimising the overall usage effort instead of just focussing on situation awareness . Even though these results are interesting by themselves , what also emerged from the study was the capacity of the microworld to gather rich data about various aspects of team behaviour . In particular , it was the cross - analysis of communication - related and awareness - related data framed in the activity log with regard for the task context that allowed us to reach these results . Furthermore , it was the ability of the 123 Cluster Comput ( 2017 ) 20 : 1637 – 1659 1653 Table 6 Measures of individual situation awareness improvement ratio ( SAIR ) between freeze probes , for each question ( Q1 – Q3 ) Probes SAIR—Situation awareness improvement ratio Q1 Q2 Q3 w / o w / w / o w / w / o w / # 1 0 . 60 ( 0 . 28 ) 0 . 59 ( 0 . 30 ) 0 . 70 ( 0 . 28 ) 0 . 78 ( 0 . 31 ) 0 . 33 ( 0 . 19 ) 0 . 24 ( 0 . 16 ) # 2 0 . 77 ( 0 . 24 ) 0 . 74 ( 0 . 23 ) 0 . 58 ( 0 . 27 ) 0 . 57 ( 0 . 32 ) 0 . 31 ( 0 . 19 ) 0 . 36 ( 0 . 20 ) SAIR ( # 2 / # 1 ) 1 . 28 1 . 25 0 . 83 0 . 73 0 . 94 1 . 5 p - value 0 . 0043 ( N = 33 ) 0 . 01 ( N = 33 ) 0 . 017 ( N = 33 ) 0 . 0029 ( N = 33 ) – ( N = 33 ) 0 . 002 ( N = 33 ) # 2 0 . 76 ( 0 . 25 ) 0 . 74 ( 0 . 23 ) 0 . 61 ( 0 . 25 ) 0 . 57 ( 0 . 32 ) 0 . 32 ( 0 . 21 ) 0 . 36 ( 0 . 20 ) # 3 0 . 78 ( 0 . 25 ) 0 . 75 ( 0 . 27 ) 0 . 35 ( 0 . 23 ) 0 . 45 ( 0 . 31 ) 0 . 48 ( 0 . 29 ) 0 . 52 ( 0 . 27 ) SAIR ( # 3 / # 2 ) 1 . 02 1 . 01 0 . 57 0 . 79 1 . 5 1 . 4 p - value – ( N = 24 ) – ( N = 33 ) 0 . 0046 ( N = 24 ) 0 . 09 ( N = 33 ) 0 . 026 ( N = 24 ) 0 . 003 ( N = 33 ) Bold values indicate statistical signiﬁcance of the results considering the minimal threshold as 0 . 05 Table7 Averages ( andstandarddeviations ) ofindividual ( IA ) andteam ( TA ) situation awareness measures derived from an analysis of team members’ activities ( IDE , IOE , TDE and TOE ) Dependent variables Conditions p - value w / o w / IA ( N = 33 ) IDE 0 . 71 ( 0 . 24 ) 0 . 73 ( 0 . 25 ) – IOE 0 . 68 ( 0 . 41 ) 0 . 80 ( 0 . 25 ) 0 . 937 TA ( N = 11 ) TDE 0 . 63 ( 0 . 10 ) 0 . 66 ( 0 . 16 ) – TOE 0 . 78 ( 0 . 19 ) 0 . 82 ( 0 . 12 ) 0 . 575 microworld to collect ﬁne - grained data from the users during the experiments that allowed us to fully understand what was really happening with teamwork and how the teams directed their usage of the groupware tool . Speciﬁcally , ( 1 ) differ - ent types of situation awareness evolved differently , and ( 2 ) for some types , the groupware tool could increase situation awareness , but the teams could ﬁnd other ways to fulﬁl their awareness needs and therefore the value brought by the tool on this matter decreased as the task evolved . We also realised that these conclusions could have only been achieved , given the holistic perspective put forward on the data gathering for the study . We gathered more data than strictly necessary to fulﬁl the original experimental aims . Had we been restricted to the set of data concerning sit - uation awareness , e . g . the questionnaires , the conclusions would instead lean towards merely abandoning the tool . We therefore argue that data variety has been important to sup - port the cycles of iterative development as posited by the tenets of design science . According to the foundations of design science , knowledge and understanding of problem domain is interwoven with the solution domain and may only be achieved through building , deploying and evaluating technology use [ 113 ] . Microworlds provide a platform that seems quite adequate to simultaneously support the cycles of building knowledge and designing technology under the design science paradigm . Accordingly , microworlds focus on problem - solving interventions that require formative feed - back on how the development is progressing and how it should proceed , and such feedback inherently requires the ability to gather rich multidimensional data . Indeed we suggest that microworld platforms contribute to teamwork evaluation in two different ways . One is to provide a clear baseline on how to evaluate progress . By controlling a set of variables that express different aspects of the team’s performance , e . g . individual and team awareness , time to complete the task , number and nature of communications , actions done by the team members on the environment , and interactions with the groupware prototype , researchers can objectively assess how the prototype development is pro - gressing throughout the iterations . The second contribution is to provide a platform that eases repeating the experi - ments with different prototypes . In particular , the current microworld referent proposed ( and the respective developed and deployed instance ) allows changing the groupware pro - totype design while preserving many other aspects related to teamwork , such as the features of the working environment , communication channels used by teams , and instruments necessary to run the questionnaires . Based on lessons taken from extensive usage of the microworld , described in this paper , we may now discuss more generic issues related to using microworlds in the research of teamwork . In this discussion , we take espe - cially into consideration the tensions identiﬁed in Sect . 2 . We highlight three major advantages we ﬁnd in the microworld approach . 7 . 1 Capacity to gather wide - band experimental data about teamwork Through various evaluation actions with the microworld , we collected very detailed indirect data about ( 1 ) movements of team members in simulated physical places ; ( 2 ) actions done by the team members in the work environment ; ( 3 ) 123 1654 Cluster Comput ( 2017 ) 20 : 1637 – 1659 exchange of voice messages between the team members , as the task enfolds ; ( 4 ) operations done by team members on groupware tools ; and ( 5 ) time necessary to complete the task . Furthermore , we also collected data directly from the users , through questionnaires , which would have to be answered at different points during the task and with consideration of its context . This wide - band approach to data collection addresses tensions No . 4 and 5 . Because of inherent complexities asso - ciated to experimental designs , often researchers have to be very economic when deciding what data to collect , for instance restricting data collection to either macro or micro activities , and to individual or team measurements . Though the case discussed in this paper suggests that experimental designs can actually cover a wider set of variables , mainly because the microworld platform facilitates data collection and relating the information in meaningful ways ( e . g . by relating voice communication with activities done by the team members , relating direct and indirect measures , and segmenting tasks in multiple phases ) . Then , the whole data set can be used to analyse various aspects of team behaviour . 7 . 2 Capacity to combine behaviour and design research This combination of research goals addresses tension No . 3 . Such a combination seems to be one of the most promising aspects resulting from our case study : exploring phenomena important to understanding team behaviour , like situation awareness , while at the same time exploring more design - oriented issues , such as groupware support . We suggest this combination of behaviour and design oriented research is unusual and can only be supported by adopting evaluation strategies that combine the requirements of both research methods , e . g . blending rigorous manipulation of variables with reuse of experimental design . Of coursemicroworlds bringsomedegreeof artiﬁcialityin teamwork that challenges behaviour research . For instance , in our case we disallowed face - to - face communication and required teams to instead use an unfamiliar voice channel . Perhaps , more importantly , the microworld also substituted actual physical movement with an artiﬁcial feature where the team members had to press buttons to move from one place to the other . And our prior experiments with the microworld simulating physical movement showed that if the feature is not properly developed , it changes teamwork behaviour ( e . g . , if there is no time associated to simulated movements , the team members will continually jump from one place to the other [ 104 ] ) . However , the platform did not impose signif - icant constraints on the overall practice of deﬁning a plan , assigning activities to team members , diagnosing network failures , and reporting to the group . We suggest that as more research into teamwork adopts the microworld approach , some of the main constraints to behavioural research may Table 8 Averages ( and standard deviations ) of the number of speech communications by nature : total , information sharing related and team management related Dependent variables Conditions p - value w / o w / # messages 10 . 09 ( 2 . 43 ) 7 . 73 ( 3 . 07 ) 0 . 007 # messages related to information sharing 2 . 36 ( 0 . 48 ) 1 . 46 ( 0 . 83 ) 0 . 005 # messages related to team management 0 . 72 ( 0 . 30 ) 0 . 80 ( 0 . 45 ) 0 , 789 Bold values indicate statistical signiﬁcance of the results considering the minimal threshold as 0 . 05 be better understood and perhaps better controlled . This , of course , would imply increasing the researchers’ attention on microworlds as a phenomenon of interest . 7 . 3 Capacity to reuse experimental components We note in particular the reuse of the communication and freeze - probe components and their pertinence across stud - ies . Regarding the latter , our study underlined the advantages of suspending a collaborative task so as to ask users about the task and the team . Suspending teamwork can be difﬁ - cult to achieve in truly naturalistic settings but it is easy to orchestrate in a more controlled environment provided by a microworld . Furthermore , considering the ability to deploy dynamic and contextually bounded questions , we ﬁnd there are plenty of opportunities to further research into teamwork behaviour . This is especially important when data collection concerns ﬁne - grained cognitive phenomena , such as group attention , task awareness , mental load , memory , impact of interruptions , etc . Concerning the reusability of the communication compo - nent , we recognise the current limitations of it , which only supports two types of speech communication . Video and text messaging are obvious gaps . However , we do not foresee technical constraints that would disallow further enriching the set of communication channels , which could then be reused across experiments . Overall , we observe that the proposed microworld components addresses tension No . 1 by combining repeatability with openness and exploration ( Table 1 ) . 8 Conclusions In this paper we present a contribution towards the data - gathering problem in teamwork research . Especially in the teamwork arena , many phenomena of interest from different ﬁelds converge , like decision making , cognition , information sharing , and communication . The evaluation of new theo - retical propositions and technologies is not straightforward , 123 Cluster Comput ( 2017 ) 20 : 1637 – 1659 1655 since the very promising theories and technological solutions may change the current status of the problem domain , as well as its understanding . As such , theory , design and evaluation should be combined and such combination requires evalu - ating readily and regularly . Because of the divided nature of the teamwork research , gathering evaluation data about teamwork faces many tensions , which make both behaviour and design oriented assessments difﬁcult to integrate and operationalize . In this paper we suggest that microworlds , which inherently provide quasi - naturalistic task scenarios , can afford to bring together the assessment of teamwork behaviour and the assessment of technology designs sup - porting teamwork . We therefore proposed a set of microworld components aimed at teamwork studies . We discussed , in particular , four components : one dedicated to simulate operations in the physical environment , one supporting voice communication between the team members , one dedicated to simulate the functionality of groupware tools , and ﬁnally a component that questions participants at certain points during the exper - iments . We described in detail the research study that was used to investigate the microworld based approach for data gath - ering in a teamwork related research endeavour . The study emphasises the capacity of the microworld to generate big data sets covering diversiﬁed aspects about team behaviour . In particular , we discussed how the microworld allowed the simultaneous gathering of both behaviour data and design - oriented data . Regarding the former , the study was mainly focussed on gathering data about situation awareness using a mix of questionnaires and logs documenting the team mem - bers’ activities within task scenarios . Addressing the design perspective , the microworld also logged the team members’ interactions with the simulated groupware tool intended to support teamwork . The diversity of data that was gathered with the micro - world , and its affordance for cross analyses , provide a rich insight over the enacted teamwork . It allowed us to conduct not only positivist oriented hypothesis testing , but further supported an interpretivist perspective , supporting an over - reaching insight on overall team behaviour and the role of the introduced groupware tool prototype . In particular , we anal - ysed the evolution of different types of situation awareness as the team task evolved . We also observed signiﬁcant changes in voice communication patterns caused by the introduction of the groupware tool . The lack of statistical signiﬁcance of multiple measures collected through the microworld highlights the complexity of doing studies in the teamwork area , and conﬁrms that multiple design changes and evaluations are often necessary . This suggests researchers need methods to ease the research design effort , readily support consequent iterations , and to gather more data about the phenomena of interest . Reﬂecting on our experiments , both developing the micro - world and using the microworld for research , we brought forward positive and negative aspects of the microworld approach . We suggest the microworld approach allows for the capture of a wide range of data about teamwork , com - bining the quantitative and qualitative views , addressing micro and macro phenomena , focussing on individual and team activities , setting some naturalistic and some controlled actions , and support behavioural and design considerations . According to the present proposal , we further posit that the microworld building blocks may signiﬁcantly contribute to the development of repeatable and more systematic studies in the teamwork area . Although , as discussed , not at all a new concept ( microworlds are in fact used in several research studies on multiple application domains ) , there is still a lack of focus on microworlds , especially in the teamwork ﬁeld . We take here a ﬁrst step toward a referent on the build - ing blocks required to develop microworlds for teamwork research in order to promote research ﬁndings that enable both comparison and generalization . Nevertheless , one must point out that more research is necessary to clearly deﬁne the speciﬁc bounds where both rigorous manipulation of vari - ables and naturalness of experiments do not compromise face validity and become accepted by the research community . This work further suggests some additional directions for futureresearch . Inapracticalperspective , weenvisagehaving a microworld platform with more features , especially regard - ing the support to communication modes , more realistic support to mobility and more operations in the environment , and more control over a wider range of variables . The possi - bility of combining humans with simulated actors in teams seems also very interesting [ 114 ] . In a more theoretical per - spective , we envisage that a more widespread adoption of microworlds may help to ﬁll the gaps between behavioural and design research . We believe such endeavour would cer - tainly contribute to consolidating teamwork research into a more distinctive integrated ﬁeld , with reliable and widely accepted innovative research methods .
