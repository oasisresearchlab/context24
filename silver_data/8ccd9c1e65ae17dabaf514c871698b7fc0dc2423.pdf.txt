Activators of Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerisation are required for spine en - largement ; however , during long - term depression ( LTD ) , spines shrink via actin depolymerisation and Arp2 / 3 in - hibitors in this process have not yet been identiﬁed . Here , we show that PICK1 regulates spine size in hippocampal neurons via inhibition of the Arp2 / 3 complex . PICK1 knockdown increases spine size , whereas PICK1 overex - pression reduces spine size . NMDA receptor activation results in spine shrinkage , which is blocked by PICK1 knockdown or overexpression of a PICK1 mutant that cannot bind Arp2 / 3 . Furthermore , we show that PICK1 – Arp2 / 3 interactions are required for functional hippocam - pal LTD . This work demonstrates that PICK1 is a novel regulator of spine dynamics . Via Arp2 / 3 inhibition , PICK1 has complementary yet distinct roles during LTD to reg - ulate AMPA receptor trafﬁcking and spine size , and there - fore functions as a crucial factor in both structural and functional plasticity .

Two major postsynaptic processes are involved in plasticity of excitatory synapses : modiﬁcation of AMPA receptors ( AMPARs ) , which mediate the majority of fast synaptic excitation in the brain , and alterations in the size and shape of dendritic spines . These protrusions from the dendritic shaft compartmentalise the postsynaptic apparatus , and concentrate biochemical signals such as calcium ( Kennedy et al , 2005 ; Bloodgood and Sabatini , 2007 ) . During long - term depression ( LTD ) , dendritic spines shrink and the number of AMPARs expressed at the synapse is decreased via regulated trafﬁcking . Conversely , long - term potentiation ( LTP ) involves spine growth and an increase in synaptic AMPAR number ( Matsuzaki , 2007 ; Shepherd and Huganir , 2007 ) . The dynamic actin cytoskeleton is central to the regulation of cell morphology and vesicle trafﬁcking by exerting me - chanical forces that alter the shape of the plasma membrane ( Merriﬁeld , 2004 ; Kaksonen et al , 2006 ) . Actin dynamics have a major role in determining spine structure ( Dillon and Goda , 2005 ; Sekino et al , 2007 ) , and have also been suggested to regulate the functional expression of LTD and LTP ( Cingolani and Goda , 2008 ) . During LTD , actin dynamics in spines shift from ﬁlamentous ( F - ) actin towards mono - meric globular ( G - ) actin , suggesting that actin polymerisa - tion is inhibited during this process ( Okamoto et al , 2004 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex is the major catalyst for the formation of branched actin networks that mediate changes in membrane geometry and is concentrated in dendritic spines ( Takenawa and Suetsugu , 2007 ; Racz and Weinberg , 2008 ; Rocca et al , 2008 ) . The Arp2 / 3 activators N - WASP , WAVE and cortactin stimulate actin polymerisation and have all been implicated in spine morphogenesis ( Hering and Sheng , 2003 ; Kim et al , 2006 ; Wegner et al , 2008 ) . However , inhibitors of Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerisation involved in spine morphology and in functional LTD have not yet been identiﬁed . An important unresolved question is whether spine dy - namics and AMPAR trafﬁcking are linked during functional synaptic plasticity . As actin regulation is involved in both processes , there is the intriguing possibility that speciﬁc regulators of actin polymerisation may regulate both receptor trafﬁcking and spine morphology . PICK1 is a PDZ and BAR domain containing protein that binds AMPAR subunits GluA2 / 3 ( Hanley , 2008 ) . This inter - action is required for AMPAR internalisation in response to Ca 2 þ inﬂux via NMDAR activation in hippocampal neurons during LTD ( Kim et al , 2001 ; Hanley and Henley , 2005 ; Terashima et al , 2008 ) . We recently demonstrated that PICK1 directly binds to and inhibits the activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex , and that this has a central role in AMPAR trafﬁcking in hippocampal neurons ( Rocca et al , 2008 ) . In this study , we show that PICK1 restricts spine size under basal conditions via direct interaction with the Arp2 / 3 Received : 14 May 2010 ; accepted : 20 December 2010 ; published online : 21 January 2011 * Corresponding author .

PICK1 – Arp2 / 3 interactions are required for spine shrinkage during chemical LTD , and also for LTD of synaptic transmission . Results PICK1 expression regulates spine size via interaction with Arp2 / 3 To investigate the role of PICK1 in regulating dendritic spine size , we used transfection of IRES plasmids that express both PICK1 and actin EGFP . Actin EGFP localises to dendritic spines and is therefore an amenable marker to measure spine size ( Ackermann and Matus , 2003 ; Chao et al , 2008 ; Saneyoshi et al , 2008 ) . Actin EGFP - positive spines are much more deﬁned than those expressing EGFP , facilitating analysis . In addition , actin EGFP - positive spines are detectable even when the spine head is in the same xy position as the dendritic shaft , whereas those expressing unconjugated EGFP would be obscured . Expression of WT - PICK1 - IRES - actin EGFP in dissociated hip - pocampal pyramidal neurons results in reduced dendritic spine size compared with neurons expressing control - IRES - actin EGFP ( Figure 1A ; control 1 . 74 ± 0 . 05 m m 2 , WT - PICK1 1 . 40 ± 0 . 04 m m 2 , P o 0 . 001 ) . To investigate the role of Arp2 / 3 inhibition , we made use of a single - point mutation in PICK1 , W413A , which speciﬁcally blocks the Arp2 / 3 interaction and Arp2 / 3 inhibition by PICK1 ( Rocca et al , 2008 ) . This mutation blocks the reduction in spine size , indeed expres - sion of W413A - PICK1 - IRES - actin EGFP results in larger spines ( Figure 1 ; W413A - PICK1 1 . 94 ± 0 . 05 m m 2 , P o 0 . 05 ) . Over - expression of neither WT - PICK1 nor W413A - PICK1 inﬂuenced the number of spines compared with controls ( Figure 1A ) . We tested both IRES - actin EGFP and IRES - EGFP constructs , and obtained the same result ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . We extended this analysis and measured spine length using NeuronStudio ( Rodriguez et al , 2008 ) .

PICK1 – Arp2 / 3 regulates dendritic spine dynamics Y Nakamura et al The EMBO Journal VOL 30 | NO 4 | 2011 & 2011 European Molecular Biology Organization 720 W413A - PICK1 overexpression causes a signiﬁcant increase in spine length compared with controls ( control 1 . 08 ± 0 . 02 m m , WT - PICK1 1 . 00 ± 0 . 01 m m , P o 0 . 005 , W413A - PICK1 1 . 16 ± 0 . 02 m m , P o 0 . 05 ; Figure 1B ) . To provide further evidence that PICK1 shrinks spines via Arp2 / 3 inhibition , we utilised the CA domain of N - WASP , which is a well - established inhibitor of Arp2 / 3 activity , and leads to spine shrinkage when expressed in cultured neurons ( Rohatgi et al , 1999 ; Haeckel et al , 2008 ) . These experiments conﬁrm this effect on spine size , and show that mCherry – CA expression in cultured neurons results in a signiﬁcant reduction in spine size compared with mCherry controls ( control 1 . 20 ± 0 . 03 m m 2 , CA 1 . 05 ± 0 . 03 m m 2 , P o 0 . 01 ; Figure 1C ) . If PICK1 shrinks spines via Arp2 / 3 inhibition , CA overexpres - sion and PICK1 overexpression should be mutually occluding with respect to spine shrinkage . In neurons co - expres - sing unconjugated mCherry , expression of WT - PICK1 - IRES - actin EGFP results in spine shrinkage compared with control - IRES - actin EGFP ( control 1 . 20 ± 0 . 03 m m 2 , PICK1 0 . 96 ± 0 . 03 m m 2 , P o 0 . 001 ; Figure 1C ) . In contrast , in neurons co - expressing mCherry – CA , WT - PICK1 - IRES - actin EGFP expres - sion has no effect on spine size compared with control - IRES - actin EGFP ( CA 1 . 05 ± 0 . 03 m m 2 , CA þ PICK1 1 . 05 ± 0 . 03 m m 2 ; Figure 1C ) . This demonstrates that inhibition of Arp2 / 3 activity via a distinct method ( N - WASP CA domain ) mimics and occludes the spine size phenotype of WT - PICK1 overexpression , supporting an Arp2 / 3 inhibitory mechanism for PICK1 in the regulation of spine size . To analyse the role of endogenous PICK1 expression in the regulation of spine size , we employed shRNA - mediated knockdown to reduce PICK1 expression . We used an shRNA sequence that leads to 53 % knockdown of PICK1 expressed in COS cells , or 47 % of endogenous PICK1 5 days after transfection in neurons ( Supplementary Figure S2 ) . Transfection of dissociated cultured neurons with plas - mids encoding PICK1 shRNA results in a signiﬁcant increase in spine size ( Figure 2A ; control 1 . 17 ± 0 . 03 m m 2 , shRNA 1 . 36 ± 0 . 03 m m 2 , P o 0 . 001 ) , but has no effect on the number of spines ( data not shown ) . This demonstrates that endogenous PICK1 functions to restrict spine size under basal conditions . To validate the speciﬁcity of the PICK1 shRNA , we gener - ated shRNA - resistant rescue constructs for co - transfection with PICK1 shRNA . Expression of shRNA - resistant WT - or W413A - PICK1 in conjunction with knockdown of endogen - ous PICK1 by shRNA results in PICK1 expression levels that are 40 % higher than endogenous PICK1 ( Supplementary Figure S2B ) . Co - expression of shRNA - resistant WT - PICK1 causes a signiﬁcant reduction in spine size compared with expression of PICK1 shRNA alone , demonstrating a rescue of the shRNA - induced phenotype . In fact , spines in these neu - rons were smaller than the control condition , indicating a small , but signiﬁcant ‘over - rescue’ ( Figure 2B ; control 1 . 11 ± 0 . 02 m m 2 , shRNA 1 . 29 ± 0 . 03 m m 2 , shRNA þ WT - PICK1 1 . 01 ± 0 . 02 m m 2 , P o 0 . 001 compared with shRNA , P o 0 . 05 compared with control ) . This is consistent with the observed overexpression of PICK1 following co - transfection of PICK1 shRNA and sh - resistant rescue constructs . In contrast , co - expression of W413A - PICK1 does not rescue the shRNA - induced increase in spine size ( shRNA þ W413A - PICK1 1 . 28 ± 0 . 03 m m 2 , P 4 0 . 1 compared with shRNA , P o 0 . 001 compared with control ) conﬁrming the crucial role of PICK1 – Arp2 / 3 interactions in restricting spine size .

PICK1 – Arp2 / 3 regulates dendritic spine dynamics Y Nakamura et al & 2011 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 30 | NO 4 | 2011 721 size under basal conditions via direct interaction with the actin - nucleating Arp2 / 3 complex . PICK1 - induced reduction in spine size is not caused by reduced surface GluA2 , and does not involve PKC It has been suggested that the level of GluA2 expressed at the synaptic plasma membrane regulates dendritic spine size ( Passafaro et al , 2003 ; Hsieh et al , 2006 ; Saglietti et al , 2007 ) . However , a number of reports also argue against this idea ( Wang et al , 2007 ; Biou et al , 2008 ; Lu et al , 2009 ) . Since PICK1 overexpression reduces surface levels of GluA2 ( Terashima et al , 2004 ) , a possible explanation for the reduced spine size following PICK1 overexpression could be that spine shrinkage occurs downstream of GluA2 internali - sation . To address this , we utilised the observation that reduced surface GluA2 following PICK1 overexpression is activity dependent ( Hanley and Henley , 2005 ; Terashima et al , 2008 ) . Using surface biotinylation assays , we show that inhibition of synaptic activity using TTX blocks PICK1 - mediated GluA2 internalisation ( Figure 3A ) . Interestingly , PICK1 overexpression results in reduced spine size even in the presence of TTX ( Figure 3B ) . Furthermore , while W413A - PICK1 expression increases spine size , it has no effect on surface GluA2 levels ( Figure 3A and B ) . This demonstrates that PICK1 can regulate spine size independently of GluA2 trafﬁcking , strongly suggesting that PICK1 - induced spine shrinkage occurs via downregulation of structural F - actin in spines . PICK1 speciﬁcally binds activated PKC and is involved in targeting this enzyme to dendritic spines ( Staudinger et al , 1995 ; Perez et al , 2001 ) . We therefore investigated whether PKC activation is involved in PICK1 - mediated spine shrink - age using pharmacological inhibition of PKC . Application of the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine for 1h before ﬁxation has no effect on spine shrinkage induced by PICK1 overexpression ( Supplementary Figure S3A ) . In addition , PKC activation by PMA has been shown to reduce spine size ( Calabrese and Halpain , 2005 ) . We therefore asked whether endogenous PICK1 is required for this process by carrying out live time lapse imaging of spines exposed to PMA ( Supplementary Figure S3B ) . PKC activation causes a reduction in spine size 20 – 50min following the initiation of drug application . PICK1 knockdown by shRNA has no effect on this process ( Supplementary Figure S3B ) , indicating that PICK1 is not required for PKC - induced spine shrinkage . These results demonstrate that PKC and PICK1 do not functionally interact in the regulation of dendritic spine size . PICK1 – Arp2 / 3 interactions are involved in LTD - induced spine shrinkage To study the role of PICK1 in dendritic spine shrinkage associated with LTD , we analysed spines following exposure to a chemical LTD protocol in hippocampal cultures . Bath application of 20 m M NMDA plus 20 m M glycine stimulates a signiﬁcant spine shrinkage ( Figure 4A ; vehicle control 1 . 15 ± 0 . 02 m m 2 , NMDA 0 . 95 ± 0 . 02 m m 2 , P o 0 . 001 ) . This effect is similar in magnitude as observed in a report of LTD - induced reduction in spine size in hippocampal slices ( Wang et al , 2007 ) . Using this stimulus , we saw no signiﬁcant change in the density of spines on the dendrite ( Figure 4A ) . Since PICK1 overexpression mimics NMDA - induced spine shrinkage ( compare Figures 1 and 4A ) , we investigated whether these treatments mutually occlude . In agreement with this hypothesis , NMDAR activation has no effect on spine size in neurons transfected with WT - PICK1 - IRES - actin EGFP , suggesting that NMDA - induced spine shrink - age involves PICK1 ( Figure 4B ; control þ vehicle 1 . 52 ± 0 . 02 m m 2 , control þ NMDA 1 . 26 ± 0 . 02 m m 2 , P o 0 . 001 .

To explore the role of endogenous PICK1 expression in NMDA - induced spine shrinkage , we used shRNA to knock down PICK1 expression levels . In control neurons expressing mCherry and actin EGFP , NMDAR activation causes spine shrinkage ( Figure 4D ; control þ vehicle 1 . 21 ± 0 . 04 m m 2 , control þ NMDA 0 . 94 ± 0 . 03 m m 2 , P o 0 . 001 ) whereas in neu - rons expressing reduced levels of endogenous PICK1 follow - ing transfection with PICK1 shRNA – mCherry and actin EGFP , spine shrinkage was completely blocked ( Figure 4D ; shRNA þ vehicle 1 . 31 ± 0 . 04 m m 2 , shRNA þ NMDA 1 . 42 ± 0 . 05 m m 2 , P ¼ 0 . 925 ) .

PICK1 – Arp2 / 3 regulates dendritic spine dynamics Y Nakamura et al & 2011 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 30 | NO 4 | 2011 723 NMDAR activation results in a steady reduction in spine size , and spines were 19 % smaller than vehicle - treated controls at 52min after the start of the stimulus ( Figure 5 ; control þ vehicle 1 . 036 ± 0 . 02 relative to baseline , control þ NMDA 0 . 84 ± 0 . 02 relative to baseline , P o 0 . 0001 ) , which is consis - tent with our data from ﬁxed cells . Further analysis revealed that baseline spine size does not inﬂuence the extent of shrinkage . Knockdown of endogenous PICK1 by shRNA completely blocks spine shrinkage in response to NMDAR activation ( Figure 5 ; shRNA þ NMDA 1 . 05 ± 0 . 04 relative to baseline , P o 0 . 0001 compared with control þ NMDA at 52min ) . These experiments demonstrate a crucial role for PICK1 in mediating LTD - induced spine shrinkage via its interaction with the actin - nucleating Arp2 / 3 complex . PICK1 – Arp2 / 3 interactions are involved in synaptically induced LTD in hippocampal CA1 region As Arp2 / 3 inhibition by PICK1 is involved in both AMPAR internalisation ( Rocca et al , 2008 ) and spine shrinkage ( this study ) during chemical LTD in dissociated cultures , we investigated the role of this pathway in synaptically induced LTD in CA1 region of hippocampal slices . Hippocampal LTD involves PICK1 - mediated internalisation of GluA2 - containing AMPARs ( Kim et al , 2001 ; Seidenman et al , 2003 ; Terashima et al , 2008 ) , but it is unknown whether Arp2 / 3 regulation by PICK1 is required . We used viral transduction with IRES - EGFP constructs in acute hippocampal slices cultured for 24h to allow protein expression . Control neurons expressing EGFP exhibit robust pathway - speciﬁc LTD in response to low - frequency stimula - tion ( Figure 6A ; control 80 . 7 ± 2 . 7 % versus test 59 . 9 ± 6 . 0 % , P o 0 . 01 ) . In contrast , LTD was completely absent in neurons transduced with WT - PICK1 - IRES - EGFP ( Figure 6B ; control 88 . 6 ± 3 . 9 % versus test 85 . 2 ± 8 . 1 % , P ¼ 0 . 62 ) . As overex - pression of WT - PICK1 reduces surface GluA2 , and LTD in CA1 pyramidal neurons involves PICK1 - mediated internalisa - tion of GluA2 - containing AMPARs , the absence of LTD in WT - PICK1 overexpressing neurons represents an occlusion rather than a block per se . Indeed , a previous report found that overexpression of WT - PICK1 reduces surface GluA2 , leading to a compensatory increase in synaptic GluA2 - lacking AMPARs that are inwardly rectifying and have a larger single - channel conductance than GluA2 - containing AMPARs ( Terashima et al , 2004 ) . We conﬁrmed this effect on basal transmission and found larger , inwardly rectifying AMPAR EPSCs in neurons transduced with WT - PICK1 - IRES - EGFP virus compared with neighbouring control neurons Time ( minutes after start of NMDA stimulus ) – 5 A i ii iii V eh i c l e c on t r o l N M D A c on t r o l N M D A P I C K 1 s h RN A 2 NMDA 12 22 32 42 52 1 . 1 S p i ne s i z e r e l a t i v e t o ba s e li ne 1 0 . 9 0 . 8 0 . 7 – 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Time ( min ) Control + vehicle Control + NMDA PICK1 shRNA + NMDA B * * * * * * Figure 5 PICK1 knockdown blocks spine shrinkage following NMDAR activation recorded by time lapse live cell imaging .

PICK1 – Arp2 / 3 regulates dendritic spine dynamics Y Nakamura et al The EMBO Journal VOL 30 | NO 4 | 2011 & 2011 European Molecular Biology Organization 724 ( Figure 6C and D ) . In contrast , neurons expressing the Arp2 / 3 non - binding mutant , W413A - PICK1 , showed no change in AMPAR EPSC amplitude , and no change in rectiﬁcation index , indicating that interaction with Arp2 / 3 is essential for PICK1 - mediated regulation of basal synaptic transmission ( Figure 6C and D ) . Importantly , in neurons expressing W413A - PICK1 , LTD was completely absent ( Figure 6E ; control 86 . 1 ± 3 . 9 % versus test 82 . 5 ± 5 . 5 % , P ¼ 0 . 59 ) . Since basal AMPAR EPSCs in W413A - PICK1 expressing neurons are unchanged compared with controls prior to LTD induction , this effect represents a blockade of plasticity . These experi - ments indicate that the regulation of Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerisation by PICK1 is required for LTD in the hippocampus . 1 . 5 EPS C a m p li t ude ( N o r m ) 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 . 0 0 15 Time ( min ) Time ( min ) 30 45 1 . 5 Control Test Control Test L L EPS C a m p li t ude ( N o r m ) 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 . 0 0 15 30 45 250 200 EPS C a m p li t ude i n t r an s du c ed c e ll ( p A ) EPS C a m p li t ude i n t r an s du c ed c e ll ( p A ) EPS C a m p li t ude no r m a li s ed t o c on t r o l EPSC amplitude in non - transduced cell ( pA ) EPSC amplitude in non - transduced cell ( pA ) 150100 50 0 250 200 150 100 50 0 0 50 100 150200 250 0 50 100 150200 250 5 iii ii i WT - PICK1 W413A - PICK1 4 3 2 1 0 C on t r o l W T - P I C K 1 W 413 A - P I C K 1 C on t r o l * * * * L 1 . 5 1 . 0 R e c t i f i c a t i on i nde x 0 . 5 0 . 0 1 . 5 EPS C a m p li t ude ( N o r m ) 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 0 R e c t i f i c a t i on i nde x 0 . 5 0 . 0 1 . 5 1 . 0 R e c t i f i c a t i on i nde x 0 . 5 0 . 0 * EGFP Control Control Test WT - PICK1 Control W413A - PICK1 Control 0 15 30 45 Time ( min ) L L L L Figure 6 Regulation of hippocampal LTD by PICK1 requires its interaction with the Arp2 / 3 complex .

PICK1 – Arp2 / 3 regulates dendritic spine dynamics Y Nakamura et al & 2011 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 30 | NO 4 | 2011 725 To provide further evidence that PICK1 – Arp2 / 3 interac - tions are required for NMDAR - dependent synaptic depression in the hippocampus , we exploited the fact that the effects of PICK1 overexpression on AMPAR trafﬁcking and EPSC properties are abolished when NMDARs are blocked ( Hanley and Henley , 2005 ; Terashima et al , 2008 ) . Neurons trans - duced with WT - PICK1 - IRES - EGFP virus in hippocampal slices and incubated in the NMDAR antagonist D - AP5 from the time of viral transduction have non - rectifying EPSCs with a similar amplitude to non - transduced cells ( Figure 7A and B , also see Terashima et al , 2008 ) . We are therefore able to investigate the acute effects of altered PICK1 expression by analysing the effects of D - AP5 washout on AMPAR EPSCs . Washout of D - AP5 ( therefore activation of NMDARs ) leads to a very rapid reduction in AMPAR EPSC amplitude , which is completely blocked by the W413A mutation ( Figure 7C ) . This result demonstrates that the W413A mutation that abolishes the interaction between PICK1 and Arp2 / 3 blocks synaptic de - pression in response to NMDAR activation , strongly support - ing a role for PICK1 - mediated Arp2 / 3 regulation in the expression of synaptic plasticity . PICK1 – Arp2 / 3 interaction is enhanced by NMDAR activation Our data demonstrate a role for the PICK1 - mediated inhibi - tion of Arp2 / 3 activity in NMDA - dependent structural and functional plasticity in hippocampal neurons , suggesting that the PICK1 – Arp2 / 3 interaction may be regulated by NMDAR activity . To test this idea , we carried out co - immunoprecipita - tions ( co - IPs ) using an Arp2 / 3 antibody from hippocampal neuronal cultures at various time points following treatment with a chemical LTD protocol . Figure 8A demonstrates that the interaction between PICK1 and the Arp2 / 3 complex is signiﬁcantly increased 10min after the start of the NMDA stimulus , and returns to basal levels at 20min . The total amount of PICK1 and Arp2 / 3 in the lysates is unchanged across all conditions . This shows that following chemical LTD induction , PICK1 – Arp2 / 3 interactions are transiently en - hanced , strongly suggesting an increase in PICK1 - mediated Arp2 / 3 inhibition during LTD . We previously demonstrated that PICK1 functions as a calcium sensor , and that its interaction with AMPAR subunit GluA2 is directly sensitive to calcium in the low micromolar range ( Hanley and Henley , 2005 ) . Since NMDAR activa - tion enhances PICK1 – Arp2 / 3 binding , we investigated the possibility that calcium directly regulates this interaction , and carried out co - IPs in buffers containing a range of free calcium concentrations . Figure 8B shows that PICK1 binds the Arp2 / 3 complex independent of calcium concen - tration , indicating that an alternative signalling pathway is involved downstream of NMDAR activation to regulate PICK1 – Arp2 / 3 binding . 1 . 4 1 . 2 1 . 0 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 0 . 0 – 10 0 10 20 30 Time ( min ) Non - transduced W413A - PICK1 WT - PICK1 1 . 4 1 . 2 1 . 0 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 0 . 0 1 . 4 1 . 2 1 . 0 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 0 . 0 WT - PICK1 A C B WT - PICK1 Control Control R e c t i f i c a t i on i nde x EPS C a m p li t ude no r m a li s ed t o c on t r o l EPS C a m p li t ude ( N o r m ) Figure 7 NMDA - dependent synaptic depression induced by PICK1 overexpression requires its interaction with the Arp2 / 3 complex .

PICK1 – Arp2 / 3 regulates dendritic spine dynamics Y Nakamura et al The EMBO Journal VOL 30 | NO 4 | 2011 & 2011 European Molecular Biology Organization 726 Discussion We have deﬁned a role for PICK1 in regulating dendritic spine size via its interaction with the Arp2 / 3 complex . Knockdown of endogenous PICK1 results in larger spines , indicating that PICK1 functions to restrict spine size under basal conditions . During chemical LTD , spines shrink via a mechanism that requires PICK1 and its interaction with Arp2 / 3 . Since PICK1 inhibits Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerisation ( Rocca et al , 2008 ) , our data strongly suggest that PICK1 inhibits the Arp2 / 3 complex in spines resulting in reduced levels of F - actin and consequent shrinkage of spines . We have demon - strated this by using the single amino - acid mutation in PICK1 ( W413A ) that abolishes Arp2 / 3 interactions , but has no effect on PICK1 binding to GluA2 , GRIP , PKC , Actin , a / b - SNAP or phospholipids ( Rocca et al , 2008 ) . In addition , we used an independent inhibitor of Arp2 / 3 activity , N - WASP CA domain ( Rohatgi et al , 1999 ; Haeckel et al , 2008 ) , and demonstrated that expression of this peptide in neurons mimics and occludes spine shrinkage by PICK1 . We have demonstrated a blockade of NMDA - induced spine shrinkage by overexpression of a dominant - negative PICK1 ( W413A ) that cannot bind the Arp2 / 3 complex , and also by reducing endogenous PICK1 expression using shRNA . This is , to our knowledge , the ﬁrst study that deﬁnes a role for a direct inhibitor of the Arp2 / 3 complex in the regulation of dendritic spine size . It is noteworthy that neither PICK1 manipulation nor our chemical LTD stimulus affects the density of spines on the dendrite . In addition , no spines completely retract during our live imaging experiments . While a reduction in spine density during hippocampal LTD has been observed , the incidence of spine elimination is very low and is also slow , taking at least an hour following stimulation ( Nagerl et al , 2004 ; Zhou et al , 2004 ) . We have also demonstrated that PICK1 – Arp2 / 3 inter - actions are required for CA3 – CA1 LTD in hippocampal slices . With respect to their effect on LTD expression , both WT - PICK1 and W413A - PICK1 overexpressing neurons appear to show the same phenotype . However , under basal condi - tions , WT - PICK1 overexpression results in larger AMPAR - mediated EPSCs , which occurs as a result of increased high - conductance GluA2 - lacking AMPARs at the synapse following PICK1 - mediated GluA2 internalisation ( Terashima et al , 2004 ) . Hippocampal LTD involves PICK1 - mediated internalisation of GluA2 - containing AMPARs ( Kim et al , 2001 ; Seidenman et al , 2003 ; Terashima et al , 2008 ) . There - fore , from a GluA2 trafﬁcking perspective , WT - PICK1 over - expression mimics and occludes the subsequent LTD . In contrast , W413A - PICK1 has no inﬂuence on basal EPSCs , indicating that neurons expressing this protein have normal levels of synaptic GluA2 . W413A - PICK1 subsequently blocks AMPAR internalisation and LTD . Since AMPAR regulation by PICK1 is NMDAR dependent ( Hanley and Henley , 2005 ; Terashima et al , 2008 ) , NMDAR blockade using the antago - nist D - AP5 suppresses the effect of PICK1 overexpression on basal AMPAR EPSCs . Subsequent withdrawal of D - AP5 results in NMDAR activation , and a PICK1 - dependent depres - sion of AMPAR EPSC amplitude , which is abolished by mutating the Arp2 / 3 - binding site on PICK1 . We have there - fore demonstrated , under both basal and LTD stimu - lating conditions , that PICK1 - mediated , NMDAR - dependent synaptic depression in hippocampal CA1 neurons requires PICK1 – Arp2 / 3 interactions . It is interesting that the acute effect ( minutes ; see Figure 7 ) of PICK1 recruitment is different from the long - term effect ( overnight ; see Figure 6 and Terashima et al , 2004 ) . The acute effect results in reduced AMPAR EPSC amplitude , indica - ting an internalisation of GluA1 / 2 or GluA2 / 3 receptors .

PICK1 – Arp2 / 3 regulates dendritic spine dynamics Y Nakamura et al & 2011 European Molecular Biology Organization The EMBO Journal VOL 30 | NO 4 | 2011 727 The long - term effect of PICK1 overexpression results in a selective internalisation of GluA2 subunit and enhanced AMPAR EPSCs ( Terashima et al , 2004 ) . This suggests that , following the PICK1 - dependent internalisation of GluA1 / 2 or GluA2 / 3 receptors , GluA2 - lacking AMPARs ( which have higher conductance ) are inserted at later time points . A role for Arp2 / 3 inhibition by PICK1 in synaptic plasticity predicts that this protein – protein interaction is regulated in response to a plasticity - inducing stimulus . In agreement with this hypothesis , we show that chemical LTD transiently stimulates increased binding of PICK1 to the Arp2 / 3 complex at 10min after stimulus . Although spines continue to shrink past 50min following chemical LTD stimulus , this process is completely blocked by PICK1 knockdown . This suggests that Arp2 / 3 inhibition by PICK1 is an absolute requirement for initiating spine shrinkage in response to NMDAR activation , and that additional mechanisms are at play at later time points . In contrast to its interaction with GluA2 , the PICK1 – Arp2 / 3 interaction is not directly sensitive to calcium , in - dicating that NMDAR activation stimulates binding via an alternative signalling pathway . In conjunction with our previous study ( Rocca et al , 2008 ) , our data show that the inhibition of Arp2 / 3 activity by PICK1 is involved in both AMPAR internalisation and spine shrinkage following NMDAR activation , as well as LTD recorded electrophysiologically . PICK1 is therefore cen - tral to mechanisms that regulate the processes of both func - tional and structural plasticity . Importantly , our data show that PICK1 - mediated spine shrinkage can occur indepen - dently of GluA2 surface removal , indicating that PICK1 regulates spine dynamics via direct modulation of structural F - actin , not as a secondary effect of AMPAR trafﬁcking . We previously demonstrated that Arp2 / 3 inhibition by PICK1 is dramatically enhanced by its interaction with GluA2 c - termi - nus , and would therefore be highly localised to the speciﬁc AMPAR - containing membrane subdomain being mobilised ( Rocca et al , 2008 ) . This modulation may underlie a mechan - ism for PICK1 to separately regulate both spine morphology and AMPAR trafﬁcking via inhibition of Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerisation . We propose a model whereby during LTD , PICK1 strongly inhibits actin polymerisation when bound to GluA2 to drive the removal of surface AMPARs , and independently has a less localised effect on F - actin levels to shrink spines . The separate PICK1 - dependent path - ways controlling spines and AMPAR trafﬁcking are also highlighted by our data that show a lack of involvement of PKC in PICK1 - mediated spine shrinkage . This is in contrast to the effect of PICK1 overexpression on AMPAR EPSC properties , which is inhibited by PKC blockade ( Terashima et al , 2004 ) . In addition to GluA2 and PKC , many other proteins interact with PICK1 ( Hanley , 2008 ) , some of which may be involved in the process that leads to spine shrinkage . We have deﬁned the Arp2 / 3 inhibitor PICK1 as a novel regulator of dendritic spine dynamics , both in restricting spine size under basal conditions , and in spine shrinkage during plasticity . Furthermore , we have identiﬁed important mechanistic details of hippocampal LTD by demonstrating that PICK1 regulates this process via an NMDA - dependent interaction with the Arp2 / 3 complex . This work shows that PICK1 has a central role not only in regulating AMPAR trafﬁcking and functional plasticity , but also in controlling structural plasticity of dendritic spines by modulating Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerisation . Materials and methods Plasmids and plasmid construction WT - PICK1 - IRES - EGFP and W413A - PICK1 - IRES - EGFP have been reported previously ( Rocca et al , 2008 ) . IRES - actin EGFP constructs were constructed by subcloning PICK1 cDNA , IRES cassette and actin EGFP cDNA into pcDNA3 . 1 . shRNA and mCherry reporters were expressed from a modiﬁed pFIV ( System Biosciences ) . mCherry was driven by the CaMKII promoter , shRNA by the H1 RNA pol III promoter . The DNA sequence used to express PICK1 shRNA was as follows : 5 0 AGGATGCTCAGAACCTGATTGTTCAAGAGACAATCAGGT TCTGAGCATCCT3 0 . The control construct did not contain shRNA . For rescue experiments , WT - PICK1 , and W413A - PICK1 had silent mutations : GAc GCa CAa AAt CTa ATc ( mutations in lower case ) . mCherry – CA was constructed by subcloning cDNA corresponding to N - WASP amino acids 459 – 501 into a modiﬁed pcDNA3 . 1 - mCherry to make an mCherry – CA fusion protein . Antibodies The following antibodies are used : anti - GluA2 ( Millipore ) , anti - GFP ( Alexa 488 - conjugated ; Invitrogen ) , anti - tubulin ( Sigma ) , anti - p34 ( Arp2 / 3 complex ; Millipore ) and anti - PICK1 ( NeuroMab ) . Hippocampal slice culture and viral transduction Slices were prepared and maintained overnight essentially as described ( Terashima et al , 2004 , 2008 ) . Transverse 300 m m hippocampal slices were prepared from 14 - day - old Wistar rat pups in high Mg ACSF ( mM ) : 119 NaCl , 2 . 5 KCl , 1 NaH 2 PO 4 . H 2 O , 26 . 2 NaHCO 3 , 11 glucose , 9 MgSO 4 and 2 . 5 CaCl 2 saturated with 95 % O 2 , 5 % CO 2 . Slices were transferred to tissue culture inserts ( Millicell - CM , 0 . 4 m m pore size ) with sterile MEM ( Gibco ) containing ( mM ) : 5 NaHCO 3 , 30 HEPES , 1 Glutamine , 1 CaCl 2 , 2 MgSO 4 , 13 Glucose and 20 % Horse Serum adjusted to pH 7 . 28 with NaOH and B 320mOsM . Slices were rested in an incubator at 35 1 C and 5 % CO 2 for 1h before being pressure injected with Sindbis virus at multiple sites along the CA1 pyramidal cell layer . Slices were returned to the incubator for 24h before use . Neuronal culture , transfection and chemical LTD Hippocampal neurons prepared from E18 Wistar rats were transfected at DIV 12 – 13 using Lipofectamine 2000 , and used for experiments 5 – 6 days later . For ﬁxed - cell experiments , cultures were ﬁxed in 4 % formaldehyde , permeablised , and the GFP signal enhanced by Alexa 488 - conjugated anti - GFP . Chem - LTD was induced at 37 1 C by exposing cells to 0 . 5 m M TTX in culture medium for 10min , then transferring coverslips to HBS buffer ( 20mM HEPES , pH 7 . 6 , 140mM NaCl , 5mM KCl , 1 . 8mM CaCl 2 , 0 . 8mM MgCl 2 5mM glucose , 0 . 5 m M TTX ) , followed by a brief application of 20 m M NMDA , 20 m M glycine in the same buffer for 3min . Cells were washed twice with HBS , and transferred back to original culture medium containing 0 . 5 m M TTX for 40min before ﬁxation . Image acquisition and analysis Fixed - cell images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope . Z - stacks of 6 – 12 images were taken at 2048 (cid:3) 2048 resolution , optical slice depth of 1 m m per image , and z - step of 0 . 37 m m . At the time of acquisition , laser power was adjusted so that all spines were below the threshold of saturation . Analysis was by ImageJ software ( NIH ) . Maximum intensity projections were processed to smooth contours and a binary mask was obtained after edge detection . The cross - sectional area , and number of spines was calculated . For each condition , 90 – 100 m m sections of secon - dary dendrite from each neuron were analysed , 4 – 6 neurons per experiment , from three separate experiments , resulting in 700 – 1400 spines per condition . Experiments were both imaged and analysed with the experimenter blind to the experimental conditions . Statistical analyses were performed in Excel ( Microsoft ) . The Student’s t - test was performed on spine density data . Cumulative plots were analysed using Kolmogorov – Smirnov test ( K – S test ) . Time lapse live confocal images of dendritic spines were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse Ti - E microscope . Z - stacks of 15 – 20 images were taken at various time points at 512 (cid:3) 512 PICK1 – Arp2 / 3 regulates dendritic spine dynamics Y Nakamura et al The EMBO Journal VOL 30 | NO 4 | 2011 & 2011 European Molecular Biology Organization 728 resolution with a z - step size of 0 . 4 m m . Neurons were continually perfused at 35 1 C with HBS at a ﬂow rate of 4ml / min . For chem - LTD , buffer was switched to HBS containing 20 m M NMDA and 20 m M glycine for 3min , followed by return to normal HBS . For PMA treatment , perfusion buffer was HBS containing 50 m M D - AP5 , 5 m M NBQX and 0 . 5 m M PMA . Baseline perfusion buffer was the same minus PMA . Glutamate receptor antagonists were present to prevent any PKC - stimulated release of endogenous glutamate from activating postsynaptic glutamate receptors ( Calabrese and Halpain , 2005 ) . Analysis was by ImageJ . Maximum intensity projections were produced for each time point and the images were processed and analysed as above . Measurement of spine length To determine spine length , z - stack images were imported into NeuronStudio ( Rodriguez et al , 2008 ) , which allows for the automated detection of dendrites and spines . NeuronStudio then measures the length of individual spines and these data were then imported into Excel for statistical analysis . Surface biotinylation assays Biotinylations were carried out as described ( Hanley and Henley , 2005 ) . Co - immunoprecipitations For NMDA - dependent co - IPs , cultured neurons were subjected to the chem - LTD protocol ( see above sections ) , and then returned to HBS for varying time points . Times stated are from the beginning of chem - LTD . Cultures were chilled on ice , then lysed in 125mM NaCl , 25mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , plus protease inhibitors . Lysates were cleared by centrifugation , then incubated with 2 m g anti - p34 antibody for 2h on ice . Protein A - sepharose beads were added and rotated at 4 1 C for 1h , followed by four to ﬁve washes in lysis buffer . Bound proteins were then detected by western blotting . Calcium - dependent co - IPs were carried out as described ( Hanley and Henley , 2005 ) , using 2 m g anti - p34 antibody for the co - IP . Electrophysiology Slices were visualised using combined IR / DIC and ﬂuorescence microscopy with an Olympus BX51WI upright microscope . Whole - cell patch - clamp recordings were made from visually identiﬁed CA1 pyramidal neurons in overnight cultured , virally transduced hippocampal slices . Recordings were made in ACSF containing the following ( mM ) : 119 NaCl , 2 . 5 KCl , 1 NaH 2 PO 4 . H 2 O , 26 . 2 NaHCO 3 , 11 glucose , 1 . 3 MgSO 4 , 2 . 5 CaCl 2 and 0 . 05 picrotoxin saturated with 95 % O 2 , 5 % CO 2 . The intracellular solution was composed as follows ( mM ) : 117 CsMeSO 3 , 8 NaCl , 10 HEPES , 5 QX314 , 4 ATP - Mg . 0 . 3 GTP - Na , 0 . 5 EGTA adjusted to pH 7 . 4 with CsOH and B 290 mOsM . For AMPAR rectiﬁcation measurements , 0 . 1mM spermine was added to the intracellular solution and 50 m M D - AP5 to the extracellular solution . In all experiments , the CA3 region was severed from the hippocampal slice prior to placement in the perfusion chamber to minimise recurrent excitation . Schaffer collateral synaptic pathways were stimulated using two bipolar tungsten electrodes placed in stratum radiatum of the CA1 region , one towards CA3 and the other towards the subiculum . For EPSC rectiﬁcation and amplitude measurements , a ﬂuorescent transduced CA1 pyramidal cell was ﬁrst identiﬁed for recording followed by a neighbouring non - transduced cell . For LTD experi - ments , individual transduced cells were recorded in each slice . Stable baseline recordings of 10min were made at a holding potential of (cid:2) 70mV and a stimulation frequency of 0 . 1Hz for each pathway . The LTD induction protocol consisted of 300 stimuli at 1Hz given to the test pathway while holding the membrane potential at (cid:2) 40mV . LTD was assessed 26 – 30min after the induction protocol by statistical comparison between control and test pathways ( paired Student’s t - test ) . EPSC amplitudes were measured at a holding potential of (cid:2) 70mV , EPSC rectiﬁcation at holding potentials of (cid:2) 70mV , 0mV and þ 40mV . For rectiﬁcation analysis , a ratio of the I / V plot slopes between (cid:2) 70mV and 0mV and between 0mV and þ 40mV data was calculated to generate a rectiﬁcation index ( RI ¼ Gradient þ 40mV / Gradient (cid:2) 70mV ) . EPSC rectiﬁcation and amplitudes were compared between transduced and non - transduced cells in the same slice ( paired Student’s t - test ) .
