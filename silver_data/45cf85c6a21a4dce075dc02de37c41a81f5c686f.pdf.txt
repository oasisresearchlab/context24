Nanoindentation of Hydrated Materials and Tissues Michelle L . Oyen Cambridge University Engineering Department Cambridge , UK mlo29 @ cam . ac . uk Abstract Nanoindentation techniques have recently been adapted for the study of hydrated materials , including biological materials and hydrogels . There are unique challenges associated with handling and testing hydrated samples . For hydrated materials , a poroelastic or poroviscoelastic analysis , which ex - plicitly treats the ﬂuid ﬂow through the porous material , is used to extract material properties from experimental data . Some key results from recent works using nanoindentation to evaluate hydrated materials are reviewed in the context of these challenges . Finally , as these studies represent relatively recent developments in the nanoindentation ﬁeld , an outlook for the future is presented , in which it is clear that a consensus is emerging for quantitative evaluation of hydrated materials via a modiﬁed nanoindentation approach . keywords : biological tissue , hydrogel , ﬂuid , poroelasticity , nanoindenta - tion 1 . Introduction For more than three decades , nanoindentation testing has been estab - lished as an e ﬀ ective tool for measuring the mechanical properties of materi - als [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] . Nanoindentation is a form of depth - sensing indentation ( DSI ) testing , in which the full force - displacement - time response is monitored dur - ing a contact mechanics experiment , which became popular for measuring material properties at depths of tens to hundreds of nanometers . The major - ity of early nanoindentation studies focussed on the evaluation of the prop - erties of relatively sti ﬀ and hard elastic - plastic engineering materials , such as metals , ceramics , glasses and semiconductors . The most commonly reported material parameters are the ( plane strain ) elastic modulus E ′ and the hard - ness H – the resistance to ( plastic ) deformation . A key enabling breakthrough Preprint submitted to Elsevier March 11 , 2015 that led to the widespread adoption of nanoindentation testing was the de - velopment of techniques [ 1 , 2 , 5 ] for the straightforward deconvolution of E ′ and H from a single nanoindentation test , one typically performed using a sharp Berkovich diamond indenter probe . The DSI approach was particularly e ﬀ ective for measuring small volumes of material , allowing for quantitative evaluation of thin ﬁlm mechanical prop - erties [ 6 , 7 , 8 ] , or for mapping properties across inhomogeneous materials at high spatial resolution [ 9 ] . Analyses for elastic indentation of a half - space , based on isotropic elasticity [ 10 ] were adapted not just for thin lay - ers and coated systems [ 6 , 7 , 8 ] but also for elastically anisotropic materi - als [ 11 ] . In addition to nanoindentation experiments , signiﬁcant e ﬀ ort has been expended on computational modelling of elastic - plastic indentation in particular [ 12 ] . This is true of both “forward” simulations , in which the in - dentation load - displacement response is predicted for a given set of material properties ( E ′ , H , hardening law ) and of the “inverse” problem , in which attempts are made to extract properties uniquely from load - displacement data . Following the establishment of robust nanoindentation techniques for characterising engineering materials , the approach was adapted for testing less sti ﬀ materials , including bulk polymers [ 13 ] , polymer coatings [ 14 , 15 ] , and biological materials [ 16 , 17 ] . For reasonably sti ﬀ materials , including hard and dehydrated biological materials such as bone [ 18 ] , tooth enamel [ 19 ] , and plant seed [ 20 ] , few experimental or analytical adaptations were required , and nanoindentation testing allowed for the spatial mapping of the elastic sti ﬀ ness of tooth enamel [ 21 ] and for the evaluation of elastic anisotropy in bone [ 22 ] based on Berkovich indentation with Oliver - Pharr [ 2 ] data analysis assuming elastic unloading . However , three sets of challenges have emerged in the context of hydrated materials , and these have prevented the establish - ment of a standardized testing routine for nanoindentation measurements of material properties . First , there are inherent challenges due to the fact that the samples are hydrated and the instrumentation was designed for testing dry samples . Second , many – although not all – hydrated materials are sig - niﬁcantly less sti ﬀ than typical non - hydrated engineering materials . Third , there is no consensus on the appropriate data analysis for interpreting data obtained from tests on hydrated samples . Thus , these three factors taken together have limited the development of routine nanoindentation testing of hydrated materials and tissues , and each will be described here in turn . We will conclude with an outlook for the future of nanoindentation of hydrated 3 materials . 2 . Hydrated Materials Two types of hydrated materials will be considered here : biological tissues and hydrogels . “Biological tissues” is a broad term encompassing both plant and animal tissues , in which the fundamental make - up of a tissue is biological cells plus extracellular matrix materials [ 23 , 24 ] . The categories of biological tissues can be further sub - divided into “hard” and “soft” tissues , where the words hard and soft do not imply anything with respect to hardness or plas - tic deformation . Hard tissues , such as bone [ 18 , 22 ] , calciﬁed cartilage [ 25 ] , enamel [ 19 , 21 ] and dentin [ 26 ] in teeth , or nacre in sea shell [ 27 ] , contain sig - niﬁcant biomineral content , such as calcium phosphate or calcium carbonate . Soft tissues such as cartilage [ 28 ] and artery [ 29 ] are non - mineralised in their healthy state . Mammalian tissues have been studied using nanoindentation largely in the context of biomedical applications , informing the community about the disease process in conditions such as osteoporosis [ 30 ] , and eval - uating the e ﬀ ect of drugs or treatments for disease [ 31 ] . Other nonclinical research involves elucidating basic structure - properties relationships in natu - ral materials more generally , including both mammalian and non - mammalian animal tissues and plant tissues . Hydrogels are hydrophilic polymeric materials in which the polymer chains are allowed to swell in water . The polymer can be synthetic or natural in source and the polymer cross linking can be chemical or physical [ 42 ] . There are two components to the total water content , water that is tightly bound to the polymer network and water that is free to move through small pores within the polymer network ( Figure 1 ) [ 32 ] . Because of their large water con - tents , hydrogels are quite biocompatible , and have been used as materials for soft contact lenses [ 33 ] , coatings on medical devices [ 34 ] , and wound dress - ings [ 35 ] . It is anticipated that the use of hydrogels in medicine will continue to expand for applications such as drug delivery applications , diagnostics , and in tissue engineering [ 36 ] . Hydrogels have also increasingly been used in basic - science biological studies investigating cell - material interactions [ 37 ] , including those in which gel mechanical properties are varied systematically in order to study mechanical inﬂuences on stem cell di ﬀ erentiation [ 38 , 39 ] . The mechanical behavior of hydrogels has long been recognized as fundamen - tally important but fundamentally lacking due to the large volume occupied by water [ 40 ] . As such , recent studies have considered hydrogel composites 4 [ 41 ] to try and improve on the baseline material properties of hydrogels while maintaining their biocompatibility . Nanoindentation has been used to char - acterise the material properties of hydrogels , which can be di ﬃ cult to “grip” for traditional mechanical testing due to their compliance and hydrated state [ 42 ] 3 . Testing Hydrated Samples For nanoindentation experiments on hydrated samples , the state of ma - terial hydration must be maintained during the test . There are at least three basic ways that this has been done . Samples can be fully hydrated in ﬂuid and then placed into the chamber of the nanoindenter , such that testing takes place quickly before the ﬂuid evaporates . A time - frame for testing can be established by weighing samples at multiple time - points on removal from a ﬂuid bath to check for evaporation . This approach demonstrated no loss of mass for polyacrylamide hydrogels in the ﬁrst hour in air [ 43 ] , establishing an acceptable time - frame for testing of just under one hour . Samples of both hydrogels and soft biological tissue have been tested when surrounded by a hydrating foam layer , with weight - loss studies demonstrating that the sam - ples were maintained in a hydrated state identical to fully submerged samples over the course of eight hours [ 29 ] . Samples can also be tested while fully submerged in ﬂuid [ 44 ] , although this can cause challenges as capillary forces have been shown to interfere with sample surface detection [ 45 ] . A detailed and quantitative exploration of the capillary forces has been performed as a function of indenter geometry [ 46 ] . Special indenter probes with longer than typical shafts are often used for ﬂuid - immersed samples , to increase the distance between the ﬂuid and the electronics of the DSI transducer . A maintenance of hydration state allows for comparisons between nanoin - dentation results for hydrated versus dehydrated samples of the same mate - rial . Bone is approximately 20 % water by volume , but a number of studies have demonstrated that dry bone is sti ﬀ er than hydrated bone with as much as an order of magnitude di ﬀ erence in elastic modulus [ 18 , 22 , 25 , 47 , 48 , 49 , 50 ] ) . A systematic study of the inﬂuence of hydration on the same bone samples showed that the di ﬀ erences can in part be explained by di ﬀ erences in probe geometry and data analysis method between di ﬀ erent studies [ 51 ] ( Figure 2 ) . However , when wet and dry samples were compared using the same probe geometry and data analysis method , plane strain modulus values for wet bone were 60 - 80 % of those observed for the same dry bone [ 51 ] . Even 5 more striking , reported hardness values for wet bone were only 30 - 35 % of those for dry bone , illustrating that the total deformations are much greater when the bone is hydrated . This hardness di ﬀ erence was consistent with the observation that total indentation displacement was greater in wet than in dry tooth dentin , giving smaller hardness values and less normalised energy dissipation during the indentation cycle [ 26 ] . Most of the literature on bone and tooth nanoindentation considers dry samples , which means the absolute values reported for properties cannot be considered quantitative . Similarly , if even more dramatic , observations have been made for hydrogels , where hydrogels with originally 80 % water were three orders of magnitude sti ﬀ er when dehydrated in either air or by immersion in ethanol [ 43 ] . There have been interesting observed di ﬀ erences from testing samples immersed in di ﬀ erent types of ﬂuid environments . Di ﬀ erences have been ob - served between the hydrated nanoindentation response of bone when tested in water and in physiological saline solution , with sti ﬀ er responses observed for saline than for water [ 48 , 47 ] . In the same study , the e ﬀ ects of a range of polar solvents and combinations of solvents were considered , and it was ob - served that bone properties changed dramatically with the ﬂuid environment . The e ﬀ ects of ﬂuid polarity on bone paled in comparison to those observed in collagen , where elastic modulus increased by orders of magnitude with de - creasing values of the solvent dielectric constant , suggesting that soft tissues are far more susceptible to ﬂuid composition than bone [ 52 , 53 ] . Because of the potential for rapid degradation of a biological sample ex vivo , antibi - otics have been added to the hydrating ﬂuid [ 54 ] . For polymeric materials , it is possible to test in a detergent solution instead of in water , which has been shown to result in data that are not inﬂuenced by the ﬂuid or adhesion between the probe tip and the sample [ 45 ] . However , this is not an option for biological materials for which it would not be physiological to test in a detergent solution . Questions have arisen as to the ideal conditions for stor - age of samples for later testing . The process of formalin ﬁxation signiﬁcantly increases the sti ﬀ ness of ﬁbrous soft biological tissues and is often avoided , while a freezing - thawing cycle has less obvious e ﬀ ects on the tissue properties [ 55 ] and is common ( and practical ) practice . Most nanoindentation studies in a ﬂuid environment have also been conducted at room temperature and not at body temperatures , further indicating that the properties measured are indicative but not necessarily quantitatively physiological . 6 4 . Testing Compliant Samples Although mineralised tissues such as bone have sti ﬀ nesses that are compa - rable to many engineering materials , hydrated soft tissues and hydrogels are much more compliant , with elastic modulus values in the kPa to MPa range instead of in the GPa range . This introduces several challenges in nanoin - dentation testing , particularly when commercial instrumentation is utilized . There are three primary challenges to overcome in this context , to do with measurement resolution , with surface detection , and intrinsic time - dependent deformation in the material . First , the testing of compliant samples works in the opposite force - displacement regime from sti ﬀ materials , with small forces at relatively large displacements compared with large forces at relatively small displacements [ 24 ] . For this reason , the probe geometry is often changed from that of a sharp , pyramidal Berkovich tip [ 2 ] to a spherical [ 50 ] or ﬂat - punch [ 56 ] tip . This increases the contact area and therefore the contact sti ﬀ ness , allowing for measure - ments within the working load and displacement ranges and resolutions of the instrument [ 24 ] . Regardless of probe geometry , there can be di ﬃ culties with the unambigu - ous detection of the sample surface when the sample is compliant . Whether the surface detection is by a force change or by a sti ﬀ ness change , a compli - ant sample may undergo signiﬁcant deformation before the instrumentation sets the “zero point” . This has been shown to lead to signiﬁcant overes - timation of the elastic modulus in compliant samples [ 57 ] . The challenges with surface detection are further complicated by the presence of ﬂuid on the sample surface ( i . e . , if the specimen is submerged ) as the ﬂuid surface tension results in apparent forces before the probe contacts the sample [ 45 ] . To overcome some of these challenges , feedback control has been utilised , such that a displacement controlled testing mode can be utilised instead of the load controlled mode typically found in commercial nanoindenters [ 43 ] . The test can be initiated when the probe is slightly above the sample but in contact with the ﬂuid , and the zero - point correction can be applied to the data post - hoc . Compliant materials frequently exhibit time - dependent mechanical be - haviour , which further introduces wrinkles into the experimental protocol . The time - dependent deformation in compliant samples requires further con - sideration in the context of nanoindentation experiments . The ﬁrst issue to be addressed is the form of the load function for the test . There are two fre - 7 quently used control modes , load - control or displacement - control , and exper - iments can either be quasistatic or oscillatory [ 24 ] . Quasistatic experiments are similar to typical loading proﬁles used for testing elastic - plastic materials , with a constant loading - or displacing - rate for loading and unloading , with or without a hold at peak load or displacement . A hold segment at the peak point is advantageous when testing time - dependent materials , because this segment is sensitive to the creep or load - relaxation occurring in the sample . For oscillatory testing , there has been a recent rise in commercially available nanoindentation equipment set - ups for contact - based measurement , in which sti ﬀ ness measurements are obtained as a function of frequency [ 56 , 58 , 59 ] . These measurements are often of little utility , as the raw dependence of sti ﬀ - ness on frequency is not converted to true material property data . Complicating matters , since the development of commercial nanoinden - ter instruments , the correction for thermal drift has included measuring the baseline change in displacement at a small , ﬁxed force with the indenter tip resting on the sample surface , either prior to or after performing the nanoin - dentation test . However , this cannot be easily disambiguated from the intrin - sic creep displacement in the sample , or , on unloading , the creep - recovery . It is therefore important to disable the thermal drift correction procedure when testing time - dependent materials using commercial nanoindenters . Finally , the time - dependent deformation must be considered explicitly in the analysis of nanoindentation data for hydrated materials , and this will be considered in detail next . 5 . Poroelastic Analysis of Nanoindentation Data The time - dependence demonstrated by hydrated materials has been de - scribed using a poroelastic model [ 60 , 61 ] , which describes a material’s con - stitutive response by the ﬂow of a ﬂuid through a porous elastic solid . The stresses and strains in the elastic skeleton are coupled to changes in the inter - nal pore pressure and the ﬂuid volume ; following the application of a load to a poroelastic material , the rise in pore pressure gives rise to time - dependent motion of the unbound ﬂuid ( Figure 1 ) . When equilibrium is reached , the total ﬂuid volume contained within the solid skeleton will have changed . The material properties of the elastic porous skeleton , the shear modulus G and the ( drained ) Poisson’s ratio ν dictate the elastic behaviour . There are three additional material constants required for a full poroelastic speciﬁca - tion , to describe the ﬂuid - solid coupling and the ﬂuid ﬂow . Di ﬀ erent sets 8 of the ﬁve constants can be utilized depending on the assumptions made , such as whether the undrained Poisson’s ratio is taken as 0 . 5 [ 60 , 61 ] . The ﬂow behaviour is dictated by the Darcy permeability , κ , which relates the ﬂuid ﬂux to the pressure gradient , and which is the most commonly reported poroelastic parameter in addition to the solid skeleton elastic properties G and ν . The Darcy ( hydraulic ) permeability can be considered as the ratio of an intrinsic permeability k to the ﬂuid viscosity η such that k = κη . The intrinsic permeability with units of length 2 , is a direct indicator of pore size and illustrates that there is more resistance to ﬂuid motion when the pore size – and the intrinsic permeability – is small . The intrinsic permeability can be estimated from ﬁrst principles for a material with known solid fraction and characteristic dimensions [ 62 ] . The poroelastic constitutive laws , like those for thermoelasticity , are cou - pled and as such there are very few mechanical problems for which poroelastic problems can be solved analytically . In particular , for indentation geometries , computational approaches have been used [ 43 , 49 , 63 , 64 , 65 , 66 , 67 ] . Individ - ual experimental data sets can be inversely ﬁt using ﬁnite element analysis [ 43 ] , but this is computationally expensive and can be tedious for large data sets . More commonly , experimental nanoindentation data can be ﬁt to a database of forward model responses with interpolation between simulations [ 65 , 67 ] or ﬁt to a master curve [ 63 , 64 ] . An interesting physical consequence of the association of permeability with pore size in the sample is that length - scale e ﬀ ects arise when testing hydrated poroelastic materials . This is a key distinguishing feature between poroelastic time - dependent deformation and viscoelastic time - dependent de - formation , which occurs in solid polymers and has no inherent length - scale e ﬀ ects . There is a length scale associated with poroelasticity , L , and this length scale is dictated by the experiment , as it represents the path length of ﬂuid travel . For an indentation test , this length scale is taken as the radius of contact , whereas for a compression test it is related to the sample size . For a poroelastic material , the length of time from application of force to equi - librium has an e ﬀ ective time constant τ = L 2 / G κ . Thus , both the intrinsic material properties , the modulus G and permeability κ , and the extrinsic length scale L dictate the load relaxation behaviour in poroelastic materials . This introduces an important reason for working to overcome limitations or challenges associated with performing nanoindentation tests on compliant , hydrated materials : the time to equilibrium is smaller when the contact area is smaller . 9 For a polyacrylamide hydrogel , indented with a spherical probe at a macroscopic length scale , relaxation occurs only over a time - scale of hours , but with much smaller scale spherical nanoindentation , the time - scale is min - utes [ 43 ] . This is illustrated in Figure 3 , which shows ﬁnite element simula - tions for the nanoindentation and microindentation experiments on polyacry - lamide gels using the experimental set - ups and material properties obtained in [ 43 ] . In the experimental time - frame of a few minutes , the microindenta - tion test appears to show no relaxation while the nanoindentation test does . However , when the full responses are normalised and compared , it is clear that the relaxation had not yet commenced for the microindentation experi - ment . It is crucial to recall in comparing these experiments and simulations that the material properties are unchanged , only the length scale of the ex - periment has changed . Testing hydrated poroelastic materials is thus more e ﬃ cient for smaller contacts , and thus ideally suited for nanoindentation . Table 1 shows a summary of poroelastic material properties of a range of hydrated biological samples and hydrogels as measured by indentation and nanoindentation testing . ( In cases where the intrinsic permeability was reported rather than the hydraulic permeability , conversion was performed assuming a value of η = 1 mPa s for water . ) In several of these studies , in - denter probes of vastly di ﬀ erent radii were used to explicitly examine length - scale e ﬀ ects [ 44 , 69 , 74 ] ; when size e ﬀ ects were found , nanoindentation ( i . e . , smaller radius ) values are reported here . As can be seen , the elastic modulus of the hydrogels and soft tissue are orders of magnitude smaller than those of bone . The permeability values generally trend upwards with decreasing material sti ﬀ ness , which is consistent with basic scaling laws ; from polymer physics , elastic modulus increases with the square of gel solid - fraction and permeability varies as solid - fraction to the − 1 . 5 [ 42 ] . The large number of available results , most reported from the last ﬁve years , demonstrate that indentation measurement of the poroelastic properties of hydrated materials is a quickly growing endeavor . An additional consequence of the distinction between viscoelasticity and poroelasticity – with its associated length scale – is that these two e ﬀ ects can be separated uniquely for materials exhibiting both behaviours simultaneously . This requires multiple experiments , and can be performed in several ways [ 68 , 71 ] . For indentation testing , the easiest way to manipulate the length - scale is to change the radius of a spherical indenter probe and indent to the same depth , resulting in systematic variation in the contact radius [ 68 ] . The set of responses can be ﬁt to a poroelastic - viscoelastic model as a group 10 Table 1 : Poroelastic properties from indentation tests on hydrated samples Material Shear Modulus , G Permeability , κ [ m 4 ( Ns ) − 1 ] Bone [ 69 ] 0 . 6 to 1 . 2 GPa 1 × 10 − 21 to 5 × 10 − 20 Bone [ 44 ] 0 . 5 GPa 6 . 5 × 10 − 20 Bone [ 67 ] 0 . 47 GPa 6 . 5 × 10 − 20 Bone [ 49 ] 0 . 43 GPa 4 . 65 × 10 − 21 Cartilage [ 72 ] 740 kPa 6 . 6 × 10 − 17 Cartilage [ 44 ] 236 kPa 6 . 6 × 10 − 17 Polyacrylamide gels [ 43 ] 298 to 365 kPa 6 . 25 × 10 − 17 to 1 . 30 × 10 − 16 Polyacrylamide gels [ 74 ] 6 . 2 to 6 . 8 kPa 4 . 2 × 10 − 15 to 5 . 8 × 10 − 15 Polyethylene glycol gel [ 64 ] 100 kPa 5 . 4 × 10 − 16 Gelatin gel [ 70 ] 27 kPa 9 . 1 × 10 − 13 Gelatin gel [ 67 ] 24 . 2 kPa 1 . 1 × 10 − 12 Gelatin gels [ 73 ] 3 to 30 kPa 4 × 10 − 14 to 2 × 10 − 13 Agar gel [ 68 ] 98 kPa 1 . 1 × 10 − 13 Agar gels [ 73 ] 10 to 100 kPa 2 × 10 − 13 to 2 × 10 − 12 Alginate gel [ 63 ] 27 . 9 kPa 3 . 6 × 10 − 13 for extraction of material parameters . The overall force is found to be the product of the viscoelastic and poroelastic contributions , indicating that the two mechanisms act relatively independently . This independence makes sense since one mechanism is dictated by polymer chain dissipation ( i . e . , the porous solid skeleton ) and the other by ﬂuid ﬂow . 6 . Conclusion and Outlook This overview has considered the nanoindentation of hydrated biologi - cal tissues and hydrogels . In both classes of materials , water is an intrinsic part of the material , and the properties that are measured in the dry ma - terial are nothing like those observed in the hydrated state . As such , it is important to develop methods for keeping the samples wet during nanoin - dentation testing , whether by testing samples quickly after removing them from ﬂuid or by testing them in a hydrated or submerged ﬂuid environment . These experiments are reasonably straightforward using typical commercial nanoindentation instrumentation for mineralised hard tissue such as bone , tooth tissues , or marine creatures , in which the overall response is domi - nated by the sti ﬀ calcium phosphate or calcium carbonate phase . It is more 11 complicated when testing hydrated soft tissues such as cartilage or hydrogels such as polyacrylamide . These materials are 75 % water or more , and as such have material elastic modulus values many orders of magnitude smaller than those for which commercial instrumentation was developed . The analysis of nanoindentation data for hydrated materials is necessarily di ﬀ erent from that of elastic - plastic engineering materials such as metals or ceramics . A poroelastic mechanical framework explicitly takes into account the ﬂuid phase and its transport through the porous solid skeleton made of polymer or biopolymer molecules . The mechanical response of poroelas - tic materials to applied loads is therefore time - dependent , and this time - dependence has an intrinsic length scale associated with the pore size of the material . Poroelastic experiments are therefore faster to execute when the experimental length - scale is smaller , meaning that nanoindentation is ideally suited for routine material property measurements in hydrated materials . In order for nanoindentation of hydrated materials to become common - place , several things are required from the community . With sti ﬀ and hard elastic - plastic materials , there is a uniform consensus about the instrumen - tation , design of experiment , and analysis of data . A lot of this relates back to the seminal 1992 paper of Oliver and Pharr [ 2 ] and the subsequent incor - poration of the Oliver - Pharr methodology into commercial nanoindentation systems . A Berkovich tip ships with the instruments by default , and the reported properties are the elastic modulus and hardness as measured from the unloading portion of the load - displacement curve . With hydrated materials , no such consensus exists , although particularly for compliant soft tissues and hydrogels , one may be slowly emerging ( Ta - ble 2 ) . Instrumentation ranges widely , including custom devices [ 63 , 64 ] , repurposed universal test frames [ 43 , 44 , 39 ] and commercial nanoindenters when the materials are su ﬃ ciently sti ﬀ [ 43 , 44 , 65 ] . Most studies use spher - ical indenter probes and poroelastic data analysis , although this is all done o ﬀ - line from the mechanical testing instrument , utilising custom codes and algorithms . A large gap exists between this emerging consensus for hydrated compliant materials and common practices for sti ﬀ biocomposites , which – even when samples are hydrated – still tend to largely follow the consensus associated with the sti ﬀ er materials and Oliver - Pharr approach , perhaps be - cause it almost works when the ﬂuid content of the material is small . How - ever , in order for the soft materials approach to take hold , it will likely require at least one manufacturer of scientiﬁc instruments to both design an instru - ment suited for these material types and to include software for facile data 12 Table 2 : Experimental nanoindenation techniques , adapted from [ 24 ] Variable Sti ﬀ material Hydrated material Probe tip geometry Berkovich Spherical Control mode Load - control Displacement - control Thermal drift correc - tion On O ﬀ Data analyzed Unloading Holding ( load relax - ation ) Data analysis Oliver - Pharr [ 2 ] ( elastic - plastic ) Poroelastic [ 63 , 67 ] Parameters reported Plain strain modulus E ′ , Hardness H Shear modulus G , Per - meabilty κ or k , often Poisson’s ratio ν analysis . Without a more turn - key way of executing tests on soft tissues and hydrogels , it is unlikely that nanoindentation of hydrated materials will really take o ﬀ . And without a simple mechanism for performing routine mechanical testing on soft hydrated materials , it is likely that the development of me - chanically robust hydrogels for biomedical applications will be considerably slowed .

Figure Captions Figure 1 : A schematic illustration of the cross - section a hydrated poroelastic material . There is bound water in the porous solid skeleton and free water in the pore space . On application of a force , the free water moves in response to pressure gradients ; the pores are interconnected and accessible to the external ﬂuid environment . Figure 2 : Plane strain elastic modulus and wet / dry modulus ratio data plot - ted for four di ﬀ erent nanoindentation experiments on the same bone samples , varying the indenter probe and data analysis method [ 51 ] . The value of the plane strain modulus varies signiﬁcantly from experiment to experiment , but there is always a substantial di ﬀ erence between values for samples tested wet versus dry . Figure 3 : Finite element simulations of nanoindentation ( nI ) and microin - dentation ( µ I ) experiments on polyacrylamide hydrogels based on the experi - ments and material property values in [ 43 ] . The responses are normalised and plotted together , illustrating that in the larger microindentation experiment , within the experimental time - frame of a few minutes , the load - relaxation has not yet begun . 21 Figure 1 Click here to download high resolution image F i g u r e 2 C l i ck h e r e t o do w n l o a d h i gh r es o l u t i on i m a g e F E o f G e l L e ng t h - S ca l e s µ I ! n I !
