S4 Appendix - Model Convergence Model Convergence In this appendix , we describe our analysis for evaluating the number of simulations needed to reach model convergence . Fig 1 shows the the average cumulative incidence for a given number of simulations . The experiments were repeated 1000 times for each set of simulations to obtain the variance . The following parameters were used - e = 100 , p case = 10 in 100 , 000 , c = 6 , SAR = 5 . 1 % , n days = 15 , p remain = 0 . 4 . As expected , the variance of the average cumulative incidence decreases with increasing simulations . For number of simulations â‰¥ 1000 , the variance is sufficiently small . 10 20 50 100 200 500 1000 2000 5000 10000 Count of Simulations 2 4 6 8 10 12 A v e r a g e C u m u l a t i v e I n c i d e n c e Fig 1 .
