Mehdi 1 , 3 , 5 * The purpose of this study is to manually and semi - automatically curate a database and develop an R package that will act as a comprehensive resource to understand how biological processes are dysregulated due to interactions with environmental factors . The initial database search run on the Gene Expression Omnibus and the Molecular Signature Database retrieved a total of 90 , 018 articles . After title and abstract screening against pre - set criteria , a total of 237 datasets were selected and 522 gene modules were manually annotated . We then curated a database containing four environmental factors , cigarette smoking , diet , infections and toxic chemicals , along with a total of 25 , 789 genes that had an association with one or more of gene modules . The database and statistical analysis package was then tested with the differentially expressed genes obtained from the published literature related to type 1 diabetes , rheumatoid arthritis , small cell lung cancer , COVID - 19 , cobalt exposure and smoking . On testing , we uncovered statistically enriched biological processes , which revealed pathways associated with environmental factors and the genes . The curated database and enrichment tool are available as R packages at https : / / github . com / Ahmed Mehdi Lab / E . PATH and https : / / github . com / Ahmed Mehdi Lab / E . PAGE respectively . Organisms are constantly being exposed to a wide range of environmental triggers that influence gene expres - sion , resulting in several diseases . Environmental factors , such as drugs , toxic chemicals , smoke , temperature , dietary components and infections are considered modifiable causes of disease through their effects on biological processes , and in response , the expression of many genes is altered 1 . It is estimated that environmental factors account for approximately 70 % percent of all autoimmune diseases and 80 % of all chronic diseases 2 . These large proportions indicate that environmental exposures are an important contributor to disease , and there is ample evidence to support complex interrelationships between various environmental and genomic factors for disease causation 3 . Manipulation of environmental triggers and the host immune system during the clinical and preclini - cal stages of a disease will offer significant insight and guide early intervention for many disorders 4 . In the era of Big Data technologies , several genomic databases exist to explore differential expression of genes under various clinical conditions 5 , 6 . However , to our knowledge there is currently no computational tool that can use information from existing large - scale databases to predict gene – environment relations . Therefore , in this study we formulated an integrated and comprehensive database that will provide insights of how environmental factors are associated to gene expression and disease , and leading to the identification of potential therapeutic strategies for the prevention and control of diseases attributable to both environmental and genetic factors .

( 1234567890 ) Scientific Reports | ( 2022 ) 12 : 18710 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 022 - 21988 - 6 www . nature . com / scientificreports / Methods We followed a two - step approach to conduct this study . First , we conducted a systematic review using a stand - ard approach to identify all studies that used integrated datasets containing comprehensive information about environmental and genetic risk factors for various diseases . Second , we curated a database and developed a statistical analysis package to enable the user to understand the relationships between differentially expressed genes and select environmental factors . Step 1 : Systematic review . The aim of this step was to identify the relevant published literature from where we could obtain existing data pertinent to gene expression changes in response to an environmental fac - tor . In detail the systematic review was conducted as follows : Search strategy . We undertook a comprehensive literature and database search using PubMed , Gene expression omnibus ( GEO ) , and Gene set enrichment analysis ( GSEA ) databases 7 . All databases were searched from their inception until 16th October 2020 . The reference lists of all the retrieved studies were examined to identify additional studies . The search terms and their synonyms related to environmental factors and gene expression . The keywords used included medical subject headings ( MeSH ) terms , e . g . , ( " Diet " [ MeSH Terms ] OR diet [ All Fields ] ) AND ( " gene expression " [ MeSH Terms ] OR gene expression [ All Fields ] ) . Table 1 details the search strategy and date of searches for various databases . Inclusion / exclusion criteria . Pre - set inclusion criterion for studies to be considered eligible were : • Only articles written in English • Participants of any age group and both genders . • Since most of the experimental trials involving environmental factors were carried out in humans or mice , we included hits for Homo sapiens and Mus musculus . • Four specific environmental factors were chosen , based on the previous published evidence for major con - tribution as an environmental factor affecting gene expression 8 . Specifically , o Cigarette smoking—Includes data related to the practice of tobacco smoking and inhalation of tobacco smoke . p Diet—Includes data on the various types and quantities of food consumed by a person . q Infections—Includes data on infections caused by pathogenic organisms such as viruses , bacteria , fungi , protozoa and parasites . r Toxic chemicals—Includes data on substances such as metals or other chemical agents that are hazard - ous to human health if inhaled , ingested or absorbed . • We included published data from datasets , series and platforms . Samples were excluded if they consisted of unpublished data . We did not limit the search specific for any disease . We did not include any dataset relating to mRNA , protein , CDS or small non - coding RNAs like miRNA or siRNA . Literature review method . Two reviewers SM and SA screened the abstracts and citations independently at the same date and time and using the same search parameters . We identified articles that met the inclusion criteria . After title and abstract screening , studies were selected for full - text review . After the full length article review , those studies that met the inclusion criteria were selected for data extraction 7 . Harmonization step . Names of Differentially expressed genes were extracted from GEO and MSigDB C7 data - bases . Pre - set inclusion criteria were used to select studies to be included in the database . Overlapping studies from the two databases were considered and coded as one study into the spreadsheet . We have further illustrated the harmonization steps in Supplementary SP4 and Figure S1 .

Two reviewers SM and SA independently extracted data . The specific features extracted from each article were : ( 1 ) Differential gene expression data ; ( 2 ) specific description of the type of data collected ; ( 3 ) specific keywords related to the differentially expressed genes for each dataset , including disease , sample condition and pathways . These were manually searched in the abstract , demographics and result sections of each publication . Data coding . Data were extracted and coded in a spreadsheet to collate information from each study . The data were combined and any anomalies between reviewers were resolved by a third reviewer ( LY ) . Differential gene expression data were obtained from the results section as well as from the supplementary section of the article . The differentially expressed genesets were annotated based on the information provided in the results section of the article on specific biological processes and / or molecular function regulated . The differentially expressed genes were coded into a spreadsheet and each geneset was provided a unique geneset number . In another spreadsheet the same geneset numbers were provided with annotations extracted from the article and a short description was given to describe the geneset module . To remove potential bias of manual annotations , E . PAGE also provides functionality to annoSP1tate each geneset using GO , KEGG and MeSH annotations 9 – 11 and users have an option to use either of methods or all . Further description on manual curation is provided in supplementary . Quality and data validity assessment . The methodological quality was checked before including the data , using the Q - Genie tool 12 . We recorded whether the study used a standard microarray procedure and descriptions of the sample data , causes of up - and downregulation of genes and any other specific changes in the gene expression . Step 2 : Software generation . The statistical analysis package E . PAGE ( Environmental Pathways Affect - ing Gene Expression ) ( https : / / github . com / Ahmed Mehdi Lab / E . PAGE ) was written in R version 4 . 0 . 3 13 and developed using RStudio 14 . Using publicly available packages tidyverse 15 , Seurat 16 as dependencies , the package performs enrichment analysis as previously described by Mehdi and colleagues 17 . Mathematically , we represent the collection of annotated modules as M = { m 1 , m 2 , . . . m n } and the universal set of genes ( background ) as U = { g 1 , g 2 , . . g w } with total of w ( U ) genes . For each query list of genes g ⊆ Ucontainingn ( g ) genes in query list , we perform statistical enrichment of each module m where m ∈ { m 1 , m 2 , . . m N } with N totm genes associated with m . We compared the number of genes N gm that had a specific annotation for gene module m against those that did not . A hypergeometric distribution was used to determine a probability ( p - value ) that N gm or more belong to the module m can be calculated using fisher exact test 18 . The p - value was corrected using false discovery rate ( FDR ) for multiple hypothesis testing using the Benjamini and Hochberg correction method 19 to determine the adjusted p - value ( p adj ) . The results are filtered based on the p adj are displayed to the user . Fold enrichment was calculated by taking the ratio of a set of genes containing a specific gene modules , and the total set of genes was obtained by taking the union of all the collected gene modules 17 as follows ; F . E = N gm / n ( g ) N totm / w ( U ) . The adjusted fold enrichment was measured as a ratio of the fold enrichment value to the negative log of p adj . An odds ratio then was measured to determine the probability of finding the set of enriched genes specific to an gene module 20 . We determined the percentage of interactions for four environmental variables ( I (cid:31) m ) where (cid:31) m = { cigarette smoking , diet , infections , toxic chemicals } , (cid:31) m ⊆ M , as follows ; I (cid:31) m = N g (cid:31) m N tot (cid:31) m × 100 . We have provided examples of running E . PAGE in supplementary SP2 . Step 3 : Case studies . We used six case studies to test our enrichment tool , these studies were not used in database curation . Case study 1 involves gene expression data in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) in children with type 1 diabetes 21 . Gene expression changes were identified using microarray analysis from 43 patients with new onset T1D compared with 24 healthy controls . The gene expression data set in case study 2 is taken from the GEO database ( microarray datasets ; GSE12021 , GSE55457 , GSE55584 and GSE55235 ) that includes samples from 45 patients with rheumatoid arthritis , compared with 29 healthy control samples 22 . Case study 3 includes gene expression data from 23 small cell lung cancer samples and 42 healthy lung tissues 23 . The gene expression data from the case study 4 was taken from cobalt - exposed rat liver derived cells 24 . The final two case studies used differentially expressed genes extracted from single - cell expression data . Case study 5 was based on single - cell RNAseq data from COVID - 19 patients , comparing severe and healthy cases in peripheral immune environments 25 , while case study 6 was based on a single - cell RNAseq - based atlas of epithelial cell - specific responses to smoking 26 . For single - cell RNA seq data , E . PAGE used a Seurat object ( with clustering performed ) as an input and performs differential expression analyses between the clusters to uncover lists of genes to compute related enriched gene modules . Results Systematic review and E . PAGE structure . The initial electronic search of GEO and MSigDB database identified a total of 90 , 018 studies ( Fig . 1 ) . Title and abstract screening of retrieved studies resulted in a total of 3547 studies which had potential data related to environmental factors . After full text examination of 3547 studies , 3008 studies were excluded since they did not provide any differential gene expression data associated with any of the four environmental factors . A total of 237 datasets were obtained from 186 studies and the gene expression data were retrieved and collated to form a database . Figure 1 illustrates a flow chart of all the steps taken to obtain the data that satisfy the required parameters . The overall structure of E . PAGE is shown in Fig . 2 . After literature screening , a database of 237 datasets was developed by linking each dataset with pub - 4 Vol : .

Specifically , the text of these 186 publications and associated datasets were manually screened to develop gene modules representing the type of experiment , experimental conditions or disease type , experimental factors , demographics of subjects , and published path - ways as previously described by Mehdi and colleagues 17 . The final database consisting of 237 datasets is obtained through GEO and MSigDB databases and includes 18 , 015 genes for diet , 13 , 259 genes for infections , 3841 genes for cigarette smoking and 644 genes for toxic chemicals . Querying E . PAGE . An R package was developed to enable statistical enrichment and gene modules associ - ated with datasets / genes of interest to a user . The package produces various data tables as shown in Fig . 2 and a user can search genes of interest for their statistical enrichment . To test the utility of the statistical analysis pack - age , we performed six case studies as described hereafter . Case studies 1 and 2 : Immune response activation in type - 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthri - tis . We first tested whether query signatures associated with T1D and RA could recover common pathways associated with these autoimmune disease . We used 291 DE genes uncovered from 43 patients with new - onset T1D as compared to 24 healthy controls 8 ( Table 2 ) and 229 DE genes from 45 samples from patients with RA , compared with 29 healthy control samples 22 ( Table 3 ) . The statistical enrichment using E . PAGE identified that the genes in both datasets are involved in Immune response . Other significant gene modules that were common to both diseases include Interferons , IL - 12 and Transcription regulation . These processes are all well known to be involved in RA and T1D 27 . Insulin resistance and Xenobiotic metabolism , which are both believed to be associ - ated with T1D , were uncovered using E . PAGE and validate the utility of the platform ( Table 2 ) . Similarly , for RA , many smoking related gene modules such as Smoking history and Pack years ( Smoking Status : Current , Never , Pack - years : ( 10 – 20 ) , Pack - years : ( 20 – 30 ; Healthy smoker ) , ( Above 40 ; Smoker with COPD ) ) , were uncovered indi - cating an important risk factor for this disease ( Table 3 ) . For both T1D and RA , a large number of gene modules related to infections , both viral and bacterial ( Lyme disease , Borrelia burgdorferi , HBV Infection , Viral response , Bacterial infection , Zika virus , Influenza A Infection , HIV infection , Echovirus - 30 , Rhinovirus infection ) , were significantly associated with disease , indicating that similar responses are occurring in patients suffering from these chronic autoimmune diseases as in responses to infections . Case study 3 : Regulation of the cell - cycle process in small cell lung cancer . We next studied gene modules associated with small cell lung cancer . The query signature containing 71 DE genes was derived from 23 clinical small cell lung cancer samples and 42 healthy control tissues 23 .

We next used E . PAGE to understand the gene expression pathways involved in cobalt exposure . We used 27 DE genes uncov - ered by measuring the effect of cobalt exposure on gene expression in two rat liver derived cell lines using microarray analysis 24 . Cobalt exposed DE genes were associated with chemical induced gene expression . Other significant gene modules include genotoxicity , carcinogen , non - genotoxic , hepatocarcinogens , and liver - based in vitro models ( Table 5 ) . Case study 5 : Single - cell COVID - 19 dataset . From a single - cell RNA sequencing dataset 25 , we first conducted a standard Seurat pipeline to determine the graph based clusters 16 . We then analysed enrichment of gene modules based on DE genes in Seurat clusters in COVID - 19 and healthy cases . As expected , we identified COVID - 19 , SARS - COV2 modules . Significant enrichment was also observed for the Inflammation , Infection - type : Acute , Immune response , Infection induced gene expression and Cigarette smoking amongst the top modules that were previously shown to be COVID - 19 - related 25 , 28 , 29 ( Table 6 ) . Case study 6 : Single - cell smoking dataset . As a sixth case study , we attempted to identify enriched gene modules related to smoking using a single cell RNA sequencing dataset which contained data of smok - ers vs non - smokers 26 . After processing the data using the Seurat pipeline and analyzing the single - cell expres - sion data , gene set enrichment identified Epithelial gene expression , Cigarette smoking , Airway epithelium , and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as the top gene modules with highly significant p - values , confirming that smoking - related pathways were correctly predicted using E . PAGE ( Table 7 ) . Furthermore , smoking associated with gene signatures of lung - associated diseases such as Lung cancer , Cystic fibrosis , as well as with Carcinogen and respiratory infections such as Influenza and COVID - 19 . User - defined annotations . The E . PAGE do not currently incorporate genetic data . However , to demonstrate its feasibility , we separately used two genetic datasets 30 , 31 associated with Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) and devel - oped automatic annotations using E . PAGE ( Supplementary SP3 ) . An independent transcriptomic dataset asso - ciated with PD was queried 32 . We uncovered annotations such as Genetic Association [ Parkinson’s Disease , GWAS + eQTL ] and cellular response to interferon - gamma . Discussion Environmental factors are known to influence the development of disease , with or without combination with genetic factors , however there is currently no curated database and enrichment tool to identify the genes and the corresponding biological processes associated with these environmental conditions . We developed E . PAGE , a database and enrichment tool to understand the gene – environment relationship . Our database was developed based on experimental evidence obtained from the published literature to establish a relationship between environmental factors , differentially expressed genes and specific biological processes associated with the genes . To set up the database , we used cigarette smoking , infections , toxic chemicals and diet , as they constitute the primary environmental factors influencing disease outcomes 4 . We made every effort to ensure completeness , accuracy and currency of the database . The current database has 237 datasets which consists of 25 , 789 genes in total . Traditional methods assume a linear relationship between environment and the genes 33 . In our study , the annotations such as Cigarette smoking have a direct relationship with environmental variables whereas the Viral response may have direct or indirect relationship with environmental variables depending on each experiment . Thus the annotations included in the study are a combination of linear and non - linear environment variables 33 . The largest number of datasets relate to diet and infections due to the long research history of these two environ - mental factors and disease . We manually curated each dataset using specific keywords and a brief description , abstract published with these datasets . We then developed an enrichment tool that uncovers modules associated with genes of interest using the methods we previously published 17 . In six case studies , we tested E . PAGE with sets of DE genes available from the literature . Specifically , we tested two gene lists associated with autoimmun - ity—T1D and RA—along with those related to small cell lung cancer , COVID - 19 and smoking subjects . To confirm the effect of toxic chemicals on differential gene expression , we also used gene expression data from a study on cobalt exposure . On testing T1D and RA associated DE genes , we found a large number of gene modules related to immune responses , which supports previous studies on how malfunction in the adaptive immune response results in Table 5 .

We also obtained a substantial number of environmental modules associated with viral and bacterial infections , which supports recent findings on how bacterial and viral infections are implicated in immune response signaling in autoimmune disease pathogenesis . The T1D and RA associated DE genes were found to be primarily enriched in infection - associated gene modules and less in gene modules associated with the environmental factors diet , cigarette smoking or toxic chemicals . This information supports the hypotheses that infection - associated immune responses are major contributors to the development of T1D and RA 34 – 36 . A substantial number of genes involved in the central nervous system were also related to RA , consistent with other evidence 37 . When small cell lung cancer genes were tested , we found a large number of environmental modules for DE genes to be related to lung cancer , as expected . We also found an expected link to cell cycle , since cell cycle checkpoints are disrupted leading to tumour development and cancer progression . Genes relating to cytopro - tective function , mitotic spindle formation are also generally dysregulated in cancer . Recent studies that show a high incidence of retrovirus in lung small cell cancer suggest a possible direct link between infections and small cell cancer 38 . To further assess associations between environmental factors with toxic chemicals , we tested genes differen - tially expressed due to cobalt exposure against the E . PAGE database . On testing , we found the modules Genotox - icity and Carcinogen to be enriched . We also obtained a substantial number of genes differentially expressed due to toxic chemicals as environmental factors , supporting the validity of the tool to identify potential involvement of toxic chemicals on DE genes involved in critical functions in a relevant datasets . On testing gene expression data sourced from patients with COVID - 19 , we found that genes differentially expressed in severe cases were linked to gene modules common between bronchoalveolar and peripheral immune environments 25 , 29 . This finding shows how the E . PAGE database can be used to find commonalities between two sets of differentially expressed genes , even if they may not have many genes in common . On testing the single - cell gene expression data for smoking we found gene modules for Cigarette smoking , Airway epithelium , Epithelial gene expression , and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Additional path - ways that are well known to be altered by cigarette smoking were identified . Therefore , E . PAGE was able to find relevant significantly enriched gene modules . From the above case studies , we found that our database is highly reliable and has the potential to establish a link between environmental factors and important biological processes . In the case studies , we generally obtained a higher number of DE genes related to infection as an environmental factor . Though this link with infection may be valid , there is a possibility of dataset bias due to limited type of input data such as gene list , similarities between infection and tissue damage - associated immune responses . Additionally , our study is limited to four types of environmental variables , therefore to increase usage towards wider community more environmental datasets need to be integrated . Our study is limited to the use of MeSH terms to query GEO database for differ - ential gene expression data . Additional statistical tests such as joint odds ratio and interaction odds ratio could be included to increase the statistical representation of the datasets 39 . Our study is currently limited to four types of environmental variables , therefore to increase usage in the wider community more environmental datasets will be integrated over time . Further updates will be the addition of other statistical tests to cover genetic data such as Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms , Copy Number Variants and DNA Methylations 40 – 42 . A key benefit of this research is to predict gene – environment interactions to identify novel associations between environmental factors and disease , and to inform hypothesis synthesis and target selection . Thereby , it allows scientists and epidemiologists to dissect which genes may be influenced by environmental exposures in different disease conditions . We illustrate this by using examples from type - 1 diabetes , rheumatoid arthritis , small cell lung cancer and COVID - 19 datasets . The current study lends itself to future extension to additional environmental variables such as alcohol , physical activities , life - style factors , along with inclusion of other kinds of genetic data which could facilitate the development of disease risk prediction models . Additionally , variable selection methods could be employed to select candidates for gene – environmental variables associated with the disease 43 .
