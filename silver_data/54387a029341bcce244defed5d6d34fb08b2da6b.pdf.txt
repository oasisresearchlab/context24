REVIEW Developmental enhancers and chromosome topology Eileen E . M . Furlong 1 * and Michael Levine 2 , 3 * Developmental enhancers mediate on / off patterns of gene expression in specific cell types at particular stages during metazoan embryogenesis . They typically integrate multiple signals and regulatory determinants to achieve precise spatiotemporal expression . Such enhancers can map quite far — one megabase or more — from the genes they regulate . How remote enhancers relay regulatory information to their target promoters is one of the central mysteries of genome organization and function . A variety of contrasting mechanisms have been proposed over the years , including enhancer tracking , linking , looping , and mobilization to transcription factories . We argue that extreme versions of these mechanisms cannot account for the transcriptional dynamics and precision seen in living cells , tissues , and embryos . We describe emerging evidence for dynamic three - dimensional hubs that combine different elements of the classical models . T ranscriptional enhancers are short seg - ments of DNA that activate gene expres - sioninanorientation - independentmanner in response to intrinsic and external sig - nals . A typical human protein - coding gene contains multiple enhancers , each bound by a specific combination of sequence - specific tran - scription factors ( TFs ) . These factors can activate appropriatetargetgenesoverlongdistances , and sometimes even across chromosomes . In this re - view , we discuss insights provided by emerging technologies in imaging and genomics . These methods are beginning to provide elegant visu - alization of enhancer - promoter communication and are transforming our understanding about how enhancers work . Enhancers work within the context of chromatin domains Developmental enhancers mediate localized pat - terns of gene expression in space and time . For example , the ZRS enhancerregulatesexpression of the Sonic hedgehog ( Shh ) gene within a spe - cific region ( theZPA ) ofdeveloping limbbudsin vertebrate embryos ( 1 ) . Dominant mutations in the ZRS cause familial forms of polydactyly — individuals with supernumerary toes or fingers . TheZRSmapsapproximatelyonemegabasefromthe Shh transcription start site , but the basis for such long - range gene control remains unknown ( 1 ) . Even in the compact Drosophila genome , there are examples of enhancers working over distances of 70 to 100 kb , including the cut wing marginenhancerandthe svb epidermalenhancer ( 2 ) . These examples are likely not exceptional — recent large - scale approaches suggest that 20 to 30 % of Drosophila enhancers may act as distal elements , skippinginterveninggenes ( 3 – 5 ) . How - ever , the average enhancer is not so remote , typ - ically mapping ~ 20 to 50 kb in vertebrates and 4 to 10 kb in Drosophila from their target genes . Evenatthesedistances , itseemsunlikelythatTFs directly touch the RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) ma - chineryatcore promoters withoutbeing brought into physical proximity . How is this achieved ? Data from both imaging and Hi - C ( genome - widechromosomeconformationcaptureassays ) indicate that metazoan genomes are organized into a series of topological associating domains [ TADs ; discussed in detail in ( 6 , 7 ) ] , which bring distant cis - regulatory elements into proximity , such as enhancers and promoters . The bound - aries of TADs are often delineated by clusters of binding motifs for insulator proteins , such as CTCF , and the promoters of actively transcribed genes , such as tRNAs ( 8 – 10 ) . How TADs are formed and affect gene expression remains un - clear . Invertebrates , loopextrusionisthecurrent prevailing model for TAD formation ( 11 ) . This involves the loading of one or more cohesin com - plexes that form tripartite rings around chroma - tin and actively extrude a chromatin loop from onedirectionuntiltheyreachabarrierthatblockstheiractivity . CTCF is likely the main barrier pro - tein in vertebrates , although its binding is quite dynamic , with residence times of 1 to 2 min ( 12 ) . In flies , embryos lacking CTCF develop normally ( 13 ) , suggestingthateither otherbarrierproteins exist , or that TADs can be formed by other mech - anisms . The yeast condensin complex can also ex - trudeDNAloopsattheremarkablerateof ~ 1 . 5kb per second in vitro ( 14 ) . Although in vivo rates haveyettobedetermined , thissuggeststhateven the remote ZRS enhancer could be brought into proximitywiththe Shh promoterinabout10min . As discussed below , loop extrusion incorporates features of two classical models of enhancer activity : looping ( e . g . , TAD loop domains ) and tracking ( e . g . , convergentmovementsofcohesin complexes loaded at flanking insulators ) . TADs impose regulatory constraints on developmental enhancers How TADs and TAD boundaries impinge on enhancer function remains an open question . ThereisconsiderableevidencethatTAD bound - aries act as insulators to preclude inappropriate enhancer - promoter interactions . An enhancer located in one TAD preferentially interacts with “ local ” promoters rather than those located in neighboring TADs ( 15 ) . Compelling evidence comesfromgeneticstudiesinmicethatremovedTADboundaries ( 16 ) or CTCF binding sites within boundaries ( 17 , 18 ) , or created chromo - somal inversions or duplications that fuse adja - cent TADs ( 19 ) . These manipulations can cause developmental disorders as a result of inappro - priate enhancer - promoter interactions ( 16 , 19 ) . Such a scenario is seen for a rare genetic dis - order affecting human limb development ( 16 ) . A large TAD containing the Epha4 gene is flanked by two smaller TADs containing Wnt6 and Ihh genes on one side and Pax3 on the other . Chro - mosomal rearrangements that disrupt the TAD boundaries result in new interactions of Wnt6 , Ihh , and Pax3 with enhancers located in the Epha4 TAD ( 16 ) . DepletionofCTCF ( 20 ) orcohesin ( 21 , 22 ) leads to a dramatic diminishment of TAD structures in vertebrates ; however , thishas only modest effects on geneexpression . Hundreds — notthousands — of genes are affected , and less than half exhibit elevated expression , suggesting spurious gains in enhancer - promoterinteractionsin theabsenceof a boundary ( 21 ) . It therefore appears that TADs constrain theactionofjustasubsetofenhancers . We note , however , that it is possible that many genes may display less precise spatial or tempo - ral expression in the absence of TADs when measured with quantitative single - cell methods . Promoter specificity , distance , and competition influence enhancer interactions As discussed above , diminishment of TAD or - ganization in trans , via depletion of CTCF or cohesin , leads to relatively mild changes in gene expression . Yet , the removal of individual TAD boundariesinciscancausedramaticphenotypes . What is the basis for this apparent discrepancy ? The latter might arise from the occurrence of promiscuousenhancerslocatednearTADbound - aries ( Fig . 1A ) . Onceaboundaryisremoved , there isagoodprobabilityforactivationofneighboring genes .

For example , a shared en - hancer in the mouse Mrf4 - Myf5 locus differen - tially regulates linked Mrf4 and Mrf5 promoters in intercalated myotome and fetal muscle fibers , respectively ( 24 ) . This enhancer mediates both patternswhenlinkedtoaheterologouspromoter , suggestingpromoterspecificitywithintheendog - enouslocus . Thus , itappearsthatsomeenhancers havethecapacitytointeractwithmanysequencesthroughoutanentireTAD , but productively en - gagejustasubsetofavailable promoters . How is this specificity achieved ? One potential mechanism is promoter compe - tition , wherebysharedenhancersaresequestered by the closer or stronger promoter when pre - sentedwithmultiplechoices ( Fig . 1C ) . Competition has been documented in a variety of developmen - talprocesses . Anotablerecentexampleconcerns the proto - oncogene c - Myc ( 25 ) . c - Myc overexpression isa major causeofmany human cancers . Expression is normally attenuated by PVT1 , a long noncoding RNAlocatedjustdownstream . The PVT1 promoter is located between the c - Myc promoter and a number of remote 3 ′ enhancers that regulate expression in differenttissues , includinglymphocytes . Theproximal PVT1 promotersequesters these shared enhancers to attenuate c - Myc expression . Proximal promoters generally have a competitive advantage over more distal promoters , but this can be negated by insulators and TAD boundaries . The higher - ordertopologiespresentinTADs increase the proximity , and therefore probability , of long - range enhancer - promoter interactions . For example , both the ZRS enhancer and distant Shh promoter are located within a common TAD , which reduces the effective dis - tance separating them . When the TAD structure is altered by a genetic inver - sion , ZRS - Shh interactions are dimi - nished ( 26 ) . However , Shh expression was restored by reducing the genomic distance separating the enhancer and promoter within the inversion chromo - some . Thus , promoter specificity , dis - tance , and competition all influence the functional consequences of disrupting TAD boundaries ( Fig . 1 ) . Models of enhancer - promoter communication Even with the contraction in space af - forded by TADs , the distances between enhancers and target promoters can be large , as seen for ZRS - Shh interactions . How can enhancers convey regulatory information across such distances ? Var - iousmodelsforenhancer - promotercom - munication have been proposed over the years ( Fig . 2 ) , including tracking ( or scanning ) , linking ( orchaining ) , looping , and mobilization to transcription factories . Al - though the field has largely converged on loop - ing , it is interesting to consider other models in light of genome topologies such as TADs . ThetrackingmodelproposedthatPolIIbound to upstream regulatory elements could move along DNA , pulling the enhancer with it until coming into contact with a proximal promoter . The motor force of Pol II elongation was seen as the key mediator of this enhancer mobiliza - tion ( Fig . 2A ) . Proposed evidence for tracking came from inserting “ road blocks ” ( insulators ) between enhancers and promoters . Long non - coding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) emanating from en - hancers directed toward their target promoters were suggested to be a manifestation of this process within the b - globin locus ( 27 ) . It is con - ceivable that loop extrusion — cohesin - driven spooling of DNA — could foster tracking of dis - tant enhancers . The linking model is an extension of obser - vations seen for the Lambda repressor , whereby protein - protein oligomersbridgedistalelements and target promoters ( Fig . 2B ) . One proposed linking factor in metazoans is the Drosophila Chip protein ( 28 ) , which was proposed to oli - gomerize from the enhancer to the promoter . However , more recent studies with the verte - brate ortholog , Lbd1 , suggests that it might actually form targeted loops through homo - dimerization when bound at enhancers and promoters ( 29 ) . Theloopingmodelproposesthatfactorsbound to two distinct sites would physically interact with each other , resulting in extrusion of the intervening DNA ( Fig . 2C ) . As TF binding is dynamic , so too is loop formation . In this mech - anism , the intervening DNA is passive during the formation of loops , in contrast to tracking or linking models where it could play an active role . The first evidence for looping came from Escherichia coli over 30 years ago ( 30 ) , where optimal interactions re - quired proteins to be located on the same side of the helix ( Fig . 2C ) . The common feature of looping and track - ing is the reliance on an adenosine 5´ - triphosphate ( ATP ) – driven motor that can move along DNA , e . g . , cohesin and / or condensin complexes in the case of loops and TADs , and Pol II elongation for tracking . Mechanisms of loop formation In vertebrates , a typical TAD contains several transcription units and dozens of enhancers . How do the right enhancers interact with the right promoters within the context of TADs ? Sequence - specific binding of CTCF and the recruitment of cohesin can contribute to targeted enhancer - promoter interactions . The first evidence for this came from a ge - netic screen in Drosophila , which iden - tified mutants that perturb long - range activation of cut and Ubx ( 31 ) . This iden - tified Nipped - B ( NIPBL in vertebrates ) , a protein required for cohesin loading . CTCF - cohesincomplexeshavesincebeen implicated in the formation of long - range loops in many contexts , acting positive - ly or negatively to regulate enhancer - promoter interactions ( 32 , 33 ) ( Fig . 2C ) . However , there are also many examples where enhancers skip over CTCF bound - regions to regulate specific target genes ( 8 ) . Thus , CTCFcansometimesfunctionas a barrier or insulator , forming loops that block inappropriate enhancer - promoter interactions , but sometimes not . Oneexplanation for thisapparent spe - cificity is an orientation dependence of CTCF binding sites . The formation of loops is facilitated by a convergent ar - rangement of such sites ( 10 ) . The first hints of this directionally came from the 5 ′ boundary element in the chicken Furlong et al . , Science 361 , 1341 – 1345 ( 2018 ) 28 September 2018 2 of 5 A Promiscuity Gene 3 Gene 4 Gene 5 Gene 2 Gene 1 E B Promoter specificity Gene 3 Gene 4 Gene 5 Gene 2 Gene 1 E TATA TATA Gene 3 Gene 4 Gene 2 Gene 1 E Distance C Promoter competition Fig . 1 . Properties of enhancers influence the impact of TAD boundaries . After boundary deletion ( dashed lines ) , enhancers ( E ) have different abilities to regulate promoters in neighboring TADs depending on their ( A ) promiscuity , ( B ) promoter specificity , ( C ) distance to other promoters . b - globin locus and the ICR in the mouse H19 - Igf2 locus , both of which depend on CTCF and function in an orientation - dependent manner ( 34 ) . Inverting the orientation of specific CTCF sites can alter enhancer - promoter loops , caus - ing changes in gene expression ( 18 , 35 ) . This orientation - dependent requirement for CTCF interactions is reminiscent of the requirement of helical phasing in bacterial , bacteriophage , and SV40 elements . In principle , CTCF orien - tation can helpensurethatthe correctenhancers loop to the right promoters , but such a mecha - nism cannot account for all aspects of enhancer specificity within TADs . CTCF and cohesin are expressed in most or all tissues and are generally involved in constitutive looping interactions ( 9 , 32 ) . However , cohesin can partner with other factors to mediate tissue - specific enhancer - promoter proximity . Sox2 ex - pressioninembryonicstem ( ES ) cells , forexample , depends on tissue - specific interactions between its promoter and a distal enhancer that is medi - atedbycohesin - Mediatorcomplexes ( 9 ) . However , the relatively mild changes in gene expression resulting from CTCF and cohesin depletion sug - gests that additional proteins also mediate dy - namic enhancer - promoter loops within TADs . YY1 is one example ( 36 ) , which is broadly , if not ubiquitously expressed . Tissue - specific enhancer - promoterloopsgenerallydependontissue - specific TFs , such as GATA1 and Klf1 in erythrocytes ( 37 , 38 ) . At the b - globin locus , GATA1 mediates promoter loops independently of cohesin by in - teracting with Lbd1 ( 38 ) . Given the density of enhancers , insulators , and TF binding sites throughout the genome , it is difficult to envisage how tracking or linking models could produce specific activation of the appropriate target gene . Enhancers often skip genestointeractwithpreferredtargetpromoters , and many enhancers ( ~ 50 % in Drosophila ) are located in introns or 3 ′ regulatory regions . In such cases , enhancer tracking or oligomeriza - tion of linking proteins would likely occlude the transcription of associated coding sequence . Strict versions of the tracking model also fail to explain transvection — gene activation across paired chromosomes . In principle , tracking or linking mechanisms could work over short dis - tances , particularly when considered in the con - text of TADs and specific loops within TADs ( Fig . 2D ) . This would bring enhancers in close proximity with other enhancers and promoters to generate a three - dimensional “ hub ” for the propagation of short - range signals . In such a scenario , the enhancer need not physically touch thepromoter , butrather , physicalproximitymay be sufficient for the regulation of promoter ac - tivity ( Fig . 2D , see below ) . Are loops sufficient for gene activation ? The emerging picture from both chromatin - capture and imaging techniquesisthat multiple enhancers and promoters are organized in com - plex nonbinary topologies ( 4 , 8 , 10 ) . This view clashes with the simplest models of TF - directed looping of a specific enhancer to a specific promoter . Here , we consider different types of enhancer - promoter topologies and their roles in transcription activation . Enhancer - promoter proximity is globally cor - related with gene activity — for example , active enhancers are generally found near active pro - moters ( andotheractiveenhancers ) ( 4 , 8 , 10 , 39 ) . However , proximity appears to be sufficient for Furlong et al . , Science 361 , 1341 – 1345 ( 2018 ) 28 September 2018 3 of 5 TF A TF B TF C TF D TF A TF B Pol II TF Enhancer Promoter Tracking Pol II T F Pol II TF RNA RNA A TF B B Linking / chaining TF B TF A Enhancer Promoter Pol II TFIID TF B TF A Enhancer Promoter TF A TF B TF A Promoter E n h a n c e r Promoter Enhancer RNA C Short - range looping ( bacteria , phage lambda ) Enhancer Promoter TF D D Looping - tracking / linking Enhancer Promoter A Promoter B RNA E n h a n c e r P r o m o t e r A P r o m o t e r B TF C Promoter Enhancer Fig . 2 .

( B ) TFs bound to a regulatory element oligomerize , chaining to the promoter . ( C ) Looping ( in bacteria , lambda ) requires protein - protein interactions between factors on the same face of the helix . ( D ) Long - range loops can bring enhancers close to a promoter , but not in direct proximity . Tracking or linking could bridge the distance . GENES IN DEVELOPMENT activating some genes but not others ( Fig . 3A ) . Thelocuscontrolregion ( LCR ) , forexample , forms contacts with the globin promoters in erythroid cells where the genes are active , but not in the brain where they are inactive ( 40 ) . Moreover , forcing a loop between the LCR enhancer and b - globin promoter is sufficient to activate gene expression ( 29 ) , indicating that proximity acts as a trigger . By contrast , enhancers at other loci are already in proximity with their target promoter prior to gene expression ( 4 , 41 – 43 ) . For example , the T helper type 2 locus contains three genes ( interleukin - 3 , - 4 , and - 5 ) that are coordinately expressed ina subsetofT lymphocytes . Thetype 2LCRcomesintoproximitywiththe IL - 3 , - 4 , and - 5 promoters during the specification of different T cell lineages , prior to their activation ( 41 ) . Only atlater stagesdo thegenesbecomeactivated , but the LCR - promoter topology remains unchanged . Similarly , a study of 100 loci during Drosophila development indicates that many embryonic en - hancers are in preformed topologies with their target promoters prior to gene activation ( 4 ) . Most of these genes contain promoter - proximal pausedPolII ( 4 ) , suggestingthattheyareprimed for rapid induction . What triggers activation ? In some cases , this may be due to subtle , dynamic movements of an enhancer or promoter within a preformed topology ( 4 , 42 ) . At other loci , the recruitment of a TF to a prelooped enhancer may trigger activation , as seen at the T helper type 2 locus in mammals ( 41 ) . These preformed loops , or “ hubs , ” might be assembled by TFs present at earlier developmental stages preceding activa - tion . GATA3 and STAT6 are thought to perform this role in the T helper type 2 locus . We suggest that gene activation is a two - step process at many loci : Enhancers and promoters come into proximity ( local compaction ) to prime expression , and then subtle topological changes trigger activation ( Fig . 3 ) . Recent live imaging supports this ; the Drosophila eve locus contains a series of 5 ′ and 3 ′ enhancers located close to the promoter that mediate expression in segmenta - tion stripes along the embryo . A lacZ reporter genecontainingMS2RNAstemloopswaslinkedtothe eve promoter and Homie insulator and positioned ~ 140kbfromtheendogenous eve locus ( 44 ) . In the absence of looping ( e . g . , insulator - insulator interactions ) , the lacZ reporter gene is located ~ 700 nm from the endogenous locus . This distance is reduced to less than 400 nm upon insulator pairing ( Fig . 3B ) . However , this proximity is not sufficient for activation in the majority of cells . Active foci of transcription ex - hibitaneventighterassociation ; ~ 330nmrather than ~ 400 nm ( Fig . 3C ) . It therefore appears that looping is necessary but not sufficient for tran - scriptional activation of the reporter gene . Simi - lar results were obtained in a transvection assay across homologous chromosomes . Only half of the paired alleles display expression ( 45 ) . These observations are reminiscent of the Shh locus — thelong - rangeZRS enhancerand Shh pro - moter are contained within a common looped to - pologythroughoutthelimbbud . Super - resolution microscopy indicatesthatthe enhancerand pro - moterareinevencloserproximityintheposterior limb where Shh is active , but not in anterior regions where it is inactive ( 46 ) . In principle , pre - formed topologies should reduce the search time andspaceofenhancer - promoterinteractions . Spa - tial confinement , for example , is the major pa - rameter that determines interaction frequency betweendistalV ( D ) J regions comprising immu - noglobulin genes in B lymphocytes ( 47 ) . Transcription hubs In addition to tracking , linking , and looping , “ transcriptionfactories ” wasaninfluentialmodel for enhancer activity ( 48 ) . According to this view , TFs bound to distal enhancers mobilize the asso - ciated gene to discrete foci that reside in fixed locations within the nucleus . Most of the evi - dence for factories was obtained by using fixed tissues in cultured cells , including embryonic blood cells . These assays revealed discrete nuclear foci containing the phosphorylated form of Pol II , in addition to many coexpressed genes that are located in different chromosomal positions , and Furlong et al . , Science 361 , 1341 – 1345 ( 2018 ) 28 September 2018 4 of 5 B C Promoter eve Promoter lacZ MS2 400 nm Inactive – no transcription Active – transcription Enhancer - promoter proximity at the time of transcription E1 E2 E3 G e n e 1 G e n e 2 Pre - formed enhancer - promoter topologies prior to transcription A E1 E2 E3 Promoter eve Promoter lacZ MS2 335 nm E1 E2 E3 insulator insulator insulator insulator E1 E2 E3 G e n e 2 G e n e 1 E2 E1 E3 G e n e 2 Gene 1 RNA E2 E1 E3 G e n e 2 Gene 1 RNA Fig . 3 .

( B ) Insulator : insulator pairing brings transgenic eve - promoter and endogenous enhancers ( E ) in proximity — from ~ 700 to ~ 400 nm , without lacZ - reporter transcription . ( C ) Further compaction ( ~ 335 nm ) occurs during reporter transcription . even on different chromosomes ( 48 , 49 ) . Be - causemanyfewerPolIIfociweredetected [ 40 to 200 per cell ( 48 ) ] compared to the number of actively transcribed genes per nucleus , the fac - tory model proposed that multiple coexpressed genes move in and out of preassembled factories . With advances in live imaging , we now know that the system is much more dynamic . For example , super - resolution live imaging revealed highly dy - namic and transient clusters of Pol II ( 50 ) . These clusters do not reside in fixed locations within the nucleus , but are instead formed de novo upon transcriptional stimulation , persisting for short periods , on the order of a minute . A dynamic variant of the transcription fac - tory model ( hubs ) is gaining momentum as it incorporates features of all classical models of enhancer - promoter interactions , explains many observations reported for transcription factories , and accounts for more contemporary observa - tions such as transcriptional bursting . According to this model , preloopedtopologiesserve as hubs or traps for the accumulation of Pol II and other complexes required for gene expression ( Fig . 4 ) . Liquid - liquid phase transitions were proposed to facilitate this process ( 51 ) because many TFs , coactivators , and components of the basal tran - scription machinery contain intrinsically disor - dered domains that can foster such interactions . Studiesoftheassemblyofgermlinedeterminants ( P - granules ) in Caenorhabiditis elegans indi - cate that different RNA and protein subunits associate through such phase transitions ( 52 ) . Live - imaging assays permitted direct visual - izationofcoalescingP - granule “ droplets ” inearly C . elegans embryos . According to this “ hub and condensate ” model forenhancer - promotercommunication , enhancers need not directly touch their target promoters , but merely come into proximity , within 100 to 300 nm ( 45 ) . The coalescence or aggregation of multipleMediator complexes , preinitiation com - plexes , andPolIIcouldservetobridgeenhancers to their target promoters over such distances ( Fig . 4 ) . Obviously , thismodel issomewhat spec - ulative , although recent studies ( 53 – 55 ) provide direct visualizations of dynamic Pol II , TF , and Mediator condensates at sites of active transcrip - tion . Moreover , active enhancers have a higher diffusionratethaninactiveenhancers ( 56 ) , which could be interpreted as less - restricted movement of TFs within liquid condensates . Conclusion Single - cell genomics , genome editing , single - molecule live imaging , and super - resolution methods are animating classical “ snapshots ” of enhancer - promoter communication . The first “ movies ” suggest that each of the classical mechanisms — tracking , linking , looping , factories — could contribute to the overall process ; however , none is sufficient . A holistic understanding will require the simultaneous visualization of enhan - cers , promoters , nascent transcripts , TFs , Pol II , and associated cofactors at specific loci within higher - order chromosomal topologies . In addi - tion , complex genetic loci contain multiple en - hancers and often use alternative promoters . Limitations in detection methods and resolu - tion currently restrict the visualization of all the moving parts . However , the remarkable advances that we have witnessed inrecentyears give great promise for a new synthesis in our understanding of complex developmental and disease processes .
