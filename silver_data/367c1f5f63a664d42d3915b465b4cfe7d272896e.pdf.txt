It has been shown by decoration with heavy meromyosin or myosin S1 that the con - tractile ring F - actin consists of two populations with opposite directionalities , respectively ( Sanger and Sanger , 1980 ; Mabuchi et al . , 1988 ) , which supports the idea that the contractile ring contracts by sliding of F - actins over each other via myosin fi la - ments ( Mabuchi and Okuno , 1977 ; Mabuchi , 1986 ) . How myo - sin and actin assemble into the ring has frequently been studied with the fi ssion yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe because many mutant strains that show defects in ring formation have been ob - tained ( Feierbach and Chang , 2001 ; Rajagopalan et al . , 2003 ) . S . pombe cells are cylindrical , and grow during interphase by elongation at cell ends where F - actin forms patch structures ( Marks and Hyams , 1985 ) and longitudinal F - actin cables origi - nate ( Marks and Hyams , 1985 ; Arai et al . , 1998 ; Arai and Mabuchi , 2002 ; Kamasaki et al . , 2005 ) . These F - actin structures are consid - ered to function in polarized growth of the cell ( Kamasaki et al . , 2005 ) . During early mitosis , the novel aster - like structure of F - actin cables is formed near duplicated spindle pole bodies through reorganization of the interphase F - actin structures . From the aster the leading F - actin cables that encircle the cell at the equator elongate , which have been considered to represent the primary contractile ring , and the contractile ring is established during anaphase from these structures ( Arai and Mabuchi , 2002 ) . Cytokinesis progresses by constriction of the ring followed by septum formation ( Gould and Simanis , 1997 ; Rajagopalan et al . , 2003 ) . Participation of myosin - II ( McCollum et al . , 1995 ; Naqvi et al . , 1999 ; Motegi et al . , 2000 ) , the formin Cdc12 ( Chang et al . , 1997 ) , and the actin - depolymerizing factor Adf1 ( Nakano and Mabuchi , 2006 ) is requisite for assembly of the contractile ring . This suggests that polymerization of actin may be a crucial step in assembly of the ring because all of these proteins from this or other organisms can induce or accelerate actin polymerization in vitro ( Hayashi et al . , 1977 ; Mabuchi , 1983 ; Kovar et al . , 2003 ) , and are localized at the division site at very early stage of mitosis ( Chang et al . , 1997 ; Chang , 1999 ; Motegi et al . , 2000 ; Wu et al . , 2003 ) . However , it has not been known how these proteins actu - ally function in the course of the ring assembly including the tim - ing and precise site of function . The main reason for this is that all of the localization studies of these and other relevant proteins have so far been performed with fl uorescence microscopy . Ultra - structural analyses of the process of ring assembly are now required in order to elucidate spatial organization of the assembly at a molecular level . Here , we investigated arrangements of F - actin in the ring by electron microscopy in order to understand basic struc - ture of the ring and how actin is assembled into the ring structure . Results and discussion We used both wild - type cells and cdc25 - 22 mutant ( Russell and Nurse , 1986 ) cells synchronized at M phase .

Here , we investigate the directionality of the ﬁ laments in ﬁ ssion yeast using myosin S1 decoration and electron microscopy . The contractile ring is composed of around 1 , 000 to 2 , 000 ﬁ laments each around 0 . 6 μ m in length . During the early stages of cytokinesis , the ring consists of two semicircular populations of parallel ﬁ laments of opposite directionality . At later stages , before contraction , the ring ﬁ laments show mixed directionality . We consider that the ring is initially assembled from a single site in the division plane and that ﬁ laments subsequently rearrange before contraction initiates .

JCB • VOLUME 178 • NUMBER 5 • 2007 766 were enzymatically digested and the cells were permeabilized with Triton X - 100 . Myosin S1 was added to the cells to deco - rate F - actin and the cells were processed for examination by transmission electron microscopy . It has been confi rmed that the structure of actin cytoskeleton in these cells is preserved through this procedure ( Kamasaki et al . , 2005 ; Fig . S1 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200612018 / DC1 ) . Both the wild - type cells and the cdc25 cells at M phase showed a bundle of microfi laments at the division site often associated with ingressions of plasma membrane in longitudinal grazing sections . S1 decoration to form arrowhead structures showed that these fi laments were composed of F - actin ( Fig . 1 , A – C ; Fig . S2 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200612018 / DC1 ) . In Fig . 1 D , the F - actins whose pointed ends faced the top asterisk in Fig . 1 B are shown in red , whereas those showing the opposite directionality are shown in blue . It is apparent that the ring was composed of F - actins of opposite orientations from each other . A longitudinal F - actin cable at - tached to the ring is seen in Fig . 1 . Such cables have been found by fl uorescence microscopy both before and after establishment of the ring ( Arai et al . , 1998 ; Arai and Mabuchi , 2002 ) . The S1 decoration showed that these cables consisted of F - actin of op - posite orientations . Another feature of these cables was that they were fragmented at the end close to the ring and then seemed to be incorporated into the ring structure . The F - actin ring of a cdc25 cell sectioned parallel to the division plane around the equator was observed as loose bun - dles of F - actin lying underneath the cell membrane and encircl - ing the cytoplasm ( Fig . 2 A ) . We examined the entire structure of six contractile rings by serial sectioning of the rings ; these rings were confi ned in 14 – 33 serial sections ( 55 nm / section ; Table I ) . Stages of the rings in the process of cytokinesis were determined as follows . Dividing nuclei were seen adjacent to edges of rings # 1 and # 2 , but they were not seen in the vicinity of rings # 3 to # 6 ( unpublished data ) . Therefore , it was consid - ered that rings # 1 and # 2 were in cells at early anaphase B . Diameters of the median circles of rings # 1 to # 4 were similar and they were 2 . 3 – 2 . 5 μ m , while those of rings # 5 and # 6 were signifi cantly smaller ( Table I ) . Thus , rings # 1 to # 4 were not yet contracting , while rings # 5 and # 6 were contracting when the cells were permeabilized . This suggests that the cells possessing rings # 3 and # 4 were at late anaphase B . The total number of F - actin in the rings was between 1 , 100 and 2 , 100 ( Table I ) . F - actins whose pointed ends were clockwise on the photographs are shown in red , and those whose pointed ends were counterclockwise are shown in blue . F - actins of unclear direc - tionality or those oriented perpendicular to the plasma membrane are shown in yellow ( Fig . 2 , B and D ) . The ratio of clockwise - oriented F - actins to counterclockwise - oriented ones in the con - tractile ring was roughly 1 : 1 for all the rings analyzed ( Table I ) . Figure 1 .

STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF CONTRACTILE RING FORMATION • KAMASAKI ET AL . 767 The average length of randomly extracted 100 F - actins in rings # 1 to # 4 was 0 . 6 μ m , while that in rings # 5 and # 6 was 0 . 45 μ m ( Table I ; Fig . S3 A , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200612018 / DC1 ) . This suggests that F - actins in the ring shortened as it contracted . It was also found that F - actins having opposite directionalities were not mixed homogeneously in the ring , but those of a same directionality were seen to form clus - ters ( Fig . 2 , C and D ) . In addition , branching of F - actin was hardly seen in both longitudinal grazing sections ( 4 rings ) and equatorial sections ( rings # 1 to # 6 ) . Next , we performed a three - dimensional reconstruction of the contractile rings in which directionality of each F - actin is indicated ( Fig . 3 A ; Fig . S3 , B and C ; and Videos 1 and 2 , avail - able at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200612018 / DC1 ) . It is remarkable in both of the early stage rings # 1 and # 2 that F - actins with the same directionality occupied about a half of the ring on the whole , as if the F - actin ring was composed of two semicircles of uniform , but opposite polarity . On the other hand , F - actins in the rings of later stages seemed to be mixed homogeneously on the whole ( Fig . 3 A ; Fig . S3 , B and C ; and Videos 1 and 2 ) . To quantitatively show this feature , we divided all serial images of the 6 contractile rings into 12 equal seg - ments , respectively , counted F - actins in each segment , calcu - lated percentages of F - actins of the major two directionalities , and then obtained absolute value of difference in the percent - ages for every segment ( Fig . 3 B ; Fig . S3 C ) . For rings # 1 and # 2 , the differences were minimum in the bottom ( segment 6 ) and the top ( segment 1 ) segments , indicating that numbers of F - actins of opposite directionalities were close in these segments , while the differences were maximum in the right and left segments , indicating that F - actins of same directionalities were dominant in these regions . Furthermore , the differences were larger in many of the segments of rings # 1 and # 2 than in the segments of rings # 3 to # 6 ( Fig . 3 B ; Fig . S3 C ) . This suggests that overlap - ping of the fi laments of opposite directionalities progress from early anaphase B to late anaphase B / cytokinesis . The fact that the fi ssion yeast contractile ring is composed of antiparallel actin fi laments of 1 : 1 number ratio strongly sug - gests that this structure is contractile , providing that myosin fi l - aments are present in the ring . Though we did not see myosin fi lament - like structures in the ring in thin sections , it has been known that the myosin - II heavy chain Myo2 is colocalized to the ring , and is necessary in establishment of the ring ( Kitayama et al . , 1997 ; Naqvi et al . , 1999 ; Motegi et al . , 2000 ) . The present fi nding is important because no evidence for actual contraction of the ring in fi ssion yeast cell has been obtained , although it shrinks during cytokinesis . We estimated the average length and the number of actin fi laments in the contractile ring to be around 0 . 6 μ m and 1 , 100 – 2 , 100 , respectively . Taking the fi lament number as 2 , 000 , total actin monomers comprising one ring would be 444 , 000 . The ac - tin concentration in the cytoplasm including all the organelles in the wild - type fi ssion yeast cells has recently been estimated to be 8 . 7 μ M ( Takaine and Mabuchi , 2007 ) , which is signifi - cantly smaller than that reported previously ( 31 . 3 [ in a minimal medium ] or 63 . 2 [ in a rich medium ] μ M ; Wu and Pollard , 2005 ) . Supposing that actin concentration in the cdc25 cell is same as that in the wild - type cell , and the length and diameter of the cyto - plasmic compartment of a mitotic cdc25 cell are 28 . 6 and 2 . 84 μ m , respectively ( Kamasaki et al . , 2005 ; this paper ) , number of actin Figure 2 .

JCB • VOLUME 178 • NUMBER 5 • 2007 768 molecules in the mitotic cell is roughly 920 , 000 . Therefore , (cid:4) 50 % of the actin molecules are used to form the contractile ring . This agrees with the observation by fl uorescence micros - copy that a majority of actin fi laments in the mitotic cell seems to form the contractile ring ( Arai and Mabuchi , 2002 ) . We found that the actin fi laments in the contracting ring were shorter than those in the ring before contraction . It has been considered that the fi laments must be disassembled during contraction because the contractile ring retains its width , depth from the plasma membrane , and density of fi laments during contraction and fi nally disappears when contraction is complete ( Schroeder , 1972 ) . Our observation demonstrated for the fi rst time that this is the case . The shortening of the fi laments is likely to be due to depolymerization of actin ( Mabuchi , 1986 ) espe - cially induced by Adf1 , which is localized to the ring through - out the course of cytokinesis and necessary for disassembly of the ring ( Nakano and Mabuchi , 2006 ) . The overall structure of the F - actin contractile ring re - vealed here leads us to predict important features of formation and establishment of the contractile ring in fi ssion yeast cells . Polymerization of actin seems to be a crucial step in the ring assembly . It has been believed that actin polymerizes in the cell preferably from the barbed end ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) . Therefore , the fact that the ring at early anaphase B seemed to roughly comprise two semicircles of unidirectional F - actins , the directionalities of which were opposite from each other , sug - gests that formation of the ring contains a step where polymer - ization of actin may take place mainly at one site in the medial cortex of the cell and elongation occurs in both directions in the equatorial plane ( Fig . 3 C ) . A strong candidate for such a site is the center of the aster - like structure of F - actin cables , which is formed near spindle pole bodies during prophase and from which the leading cable ( s ) elongate ( Arai and Mabuchi , 2002 ) . An intriguing possibility is that the formin Cdc12 may localize to the center of this structure . This formin is necessary for elon - gation of the leading cable ( s ) from this region ( Arai and Mabuchi , 2002 ) . It functions in vitro to promote nucleation of actin poly - merization at barbed ends ( Kovar et al . , 2003 ) . It is localized to a single spot in the mid - region of the cell during early mitosis ( Chang et al . , 1997 ; Chang , 1999 ; Yonetani , A . , and F . Chang , personal communication ) . Furthermore , it is localized at the center of an aster - like structure formed in cdc4 mutant cells at a restrictive temperature ( Chang et al . , 1997 ) . The cdc4 + gene encodes the myosin - II essential light chain ( McCollum et al . , 1995 ) and its mutation affects myosin - II functions , one of which is likely to accomplish ring formation together with F - actins after formation of the aster - like structure ( Motegi et al . , 2000 ) . Therefore , ring formation would not proceed beyond the aster - like structure in the cdc4 mutant cells . In addition , presence of clusters of F - actin of a same di - rectionality in the contractile ring may also refl ect a process of formation of the ring . It has been reported that the F - actin cables accumulate as rays of the aster - like structure are somehow fused with the leading cable to form the contractile ring during ana - phase ( Arai and Mabuchi , 2002 ) . The ring thus may contain remnants of the cables , each of which probably consists of uni - directional F - actins . It was also shown that in late anaphase B contractile ring , which was not contracting yet , F - actins of opposite directionali - ties were mixed homogeneously on the whole . Therefore , there must be mechanism ( s ) by which F - actins are rearranged in the ring during anaphase before contraction initiates . There may be two possible mechanisms for this rearrangement : First , sites for polymerization of actin may be scattered in the division plane at the later stage of contractile ring formation , although polymer - ization may occur mainly at one site at the beginning as men - tioned above . This idea seems to be supported by localization of Cdc12 . Although Cdc12 mainly localizes to a single spot during early mitosis , it then spreads in the division plane ( Chang , 1999 ; Yonetani , A . , and F . Chang , personal communication ) . Thus , this protein would be able to polymerize actin at various spots in the division plane during anaphase . Actually , we have ob - served that Cdc12 forms a ring containing 10 – 20 strong spots during anaphase ( unpublished data ) . It has recently been pub - lished that Cdc12 is scattered as a broad band of nodes at the division site during early mitosis ( Wu et al . , 2006 ) . We do not know Table I .

Some of these F - actins spanned two serial sections . Diameter of the ring was estimated as follows . First , the area enclosed by a median circle of a ring , which passes through midpoints of the width of the ring was estimated using NIH Image . The diameter was then calculated supposing that the median circle was a complete circle . STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF CONTRACTILE RING FORMATION • KAMASAKI ET AL . 769 what the reasons for the discrepancy are , but this observation might have been done after its spreading . Myosin - II ( Myo2 ) that accumulates as multiple spots ( Motegi et al . , 2000 ) at the division site through binding to Mid1 ( Motegi et al . , 2004 ) is also capable of organizing actin because mutant Myo2s , which prematurely accumulate at the presumptive division site even during G2 phase , induce F - actin accumulation at the same site during G2 ( Motegi et al . , 2004 ) . These proteins could produce antiparallel F - actins in each semicircle during anaphase . If this type of rearrangement takes place , actin in the original semi - circles would be turning over . It has been suggested that the con tractile ring actin turns over even after establishment of the ring in Xenopus eggs ( Noguchi and Mabuchi , 2001 ) , and demon - strated in cultured cells ( Guha et al . , 2005 ) . A FRAP study on GFP - Cdc8 ( tropomyosin ) also suggests that actin turns over in the contractile ring in fi ssion yeast cells ( Pelham and Chang , 2002 ) . The fact that the actin - depolymerizing factor , Adf1 , which promotes actin turnover , is necessary for maintenance of the contractile ring structure in addition to its formation in fi s - sion yeast ( Nakano and Mabuchi , 2006 ) , supports the idea of turnover of actin in the ring . Second , F - actins could slide over each other being medi - ated by Myo2 without accompanying contraction of the ring , and therefore the mixed directionality is produced during late anaphase B . It may also be responsible for redistribution of Cdc12 nucleation sites in the division plane . This sliding with - out contraction would occur if the F - actins are only weakly or not attached to the cell membrane . Unfortunately , it has not been known when the contractile ring F - actin fi rmly attaches to the cell membrane during formation of the ring . Actin dynamics and actin – membrane interaction in the contractile ring must be investigated in order to clarify mechanism of contractile ring formation . Mitoses in fi ssion yeast cells and animal cells are differ - ent in that the nuclear membrane persists and the mitotic spin - dle is formed inside the nucleus in fi ssion yeast , while the mitotic apparatus is formed after breakdown of the nuclear membrane in animal cells , which has a symmetric microtubular structure . In fi ssion yeast , a signal for contractile ring assembly is thought to be transferred from the nucleus to the cell cortex ( Chang and Nurse , 1996 ) through the spindle pole bodies ( Arai and Mabuchi , 2002 ) ; a strong candidate for a division signal molecule , Plo1 , which is a fi ssion yeast orthologue of the Polo kinase that is fi rst localized to the spindle pole bodies and then transferred to the mid - ring structure during early mitosis ( Bahler et al . , 1998 ) . This agrees well with the present observa - tion that the contractile ring actin assembly initiates at one site in fi ssion yeast . On the other hand , microtubules emanating from the sepa - rated centrosomes converge at the equatorial cortex in anaphase animal cells , and are thought to transmit cleavage signals to the cortex . Thus , contractile ring formation is expected to initiate simultaneously at multiple sites in the mid - cortex . It has re - cently been shown that cleavage signaling molecules are local - ized to tips of astral microtubules at the equatorial cortex in HeLa cells ( Nishimura and Yonemura , 2006 ) . The signal may be transmitted to the cortex through these molecules at multiple sites , each of which may correspond to the single site in fi ssion yeast cells , and basically similar assembly and rearrangement of actin may occur at these sites .

Three - dimensional reconstruction Three - dimensional reconstructions of the F - actin contractile rings decorated with S1 were performed using serially sectioned images . Micrographs originally taken at 25 , 000 × were enlarged to 100 , 000 × . After determin - ing the directionality of each F - actin in the ring , images of the F - actin were traced from the individual electron micrographs . The tracings of F - actin were aligned and superimposed to produce reconstructed images using the TRI / 3D SRF II program ( Ratoc System Engineering ) and Windows NT . Fluorescence microscopy Staining of ﬁ xed cells with Bodipy - phallacidin and permeabilization of unﬁ xed cells in the presence of rhodamine - phalloidin were performed as described previously ( Arai and Mabuchi , 2002 ; Kamasaki et al . , 2005 ) . Both of these cells were ﬁ nally washed with a solution of 20 mM Pipes , 20 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM EGTA , pH 7 . 0 , and protease inhibitors , and observed in the same solution with an Axioskop ﬂ uorescence microscope ( Carl Zeiss MicroImaging , Inc . ) equipped with a Plan Apochromat 63 × / 1 . 40 oil ob - jective lens and appropriate ﬁ lters . Images were acquired using a CCD camera ( SPOT ; Diagnostic Instruments ) . Online supplemental material Fig .
