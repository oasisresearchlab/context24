On the other hand , data summaries are often used in graphs because they aid interpretation . To democratize state - of - the - art data visualization of raw data with a selection of statistical summaries , a freely available , open - source web app was written using R / shiny that uses the ggplot2 package for generating plots . Users can to choose how to display the data and which of the data summaries to add . In addition , the 95 % confidence intervals ( 95CIs ) can be added for visual inferences . By adjusting the visibility of the layers , the visualization of the raw data and their summaries can be tuned for optimal presentation and interpretation . The app is dubbed PlotsOfData and is available at https : / / huygens . science . uva . nl / PlotsOfData / . Introduction Over the recent years , several groups have advocated the presentation of the actual data in graphs instead of data summaries [ 1 – 4 ] . Raw data can be visualized in different ways , includ - ing histograms and dot plots . Data summaries may be displayed to aid interpretation of the data . In addition , direct comparison of the different categories / conditions can be done by “visual inference” if 95 % confidence intervals ( 95CIs ) are supplied [ 5 , 6 ] . Several commercial software packages are available to draw data and their summaries . However , ideally , such tools should be open source , freely available , and allow contributions or modifications by users . One example of a free open - source web - based app to plot a combina - tion of raw data and summaries is BoxPlotR ( http : / / shiny . chemgrid . org / boxplotr / ) . The web - based app is described in a paper [ 7 ] that is remarkably well cited . Its popularity reflects a demand for easy - to - use applications that generate publication - quality data visualizations . However , this popular online tool is skewed towards box plots as data summaries and has hardly any options for customizing the combined display of data and summaries . Moreover , the plots are rather basic in appearance . State - of - the art data visualization is possible with the R package ggplot2 , which uses the ideas of a “grammar of graphics” to generate a graphic by using multiple layers of data [ 8 ] .

The option to apply transparency to the data layers adds to the flexibility . Yet , the high - quality data visualization provided by ggplot2 requires coding skills and understanding the concept of tidy data [ 9 ] . To democratize state - of - the - art data visualization of raw data with a selection of statistical summaries , we generated a web tool that we dubbed PlotsOfData . The web tool uses ggplot2 to compose the graphs and handles data in ordinary spreadsheet ( wide ) format as well as the tidy data format . Because creating graphs with PlotsOfData does not require coding skills , the high - quality data visualization provided by ggplot2 is now available to anyone . Some of the fea - tures of PlotsOfData will be highlighted below . Availability and code PlotsOfData is available online at : https : / / huygens . science . uva . nl / PlotsOfData / . The app uses the shiny package and was written in R , using R ( https : / / www . r - project . org ) and Rstudio ( https : / / www . rstudio . com ) . It uses several freely available packages ( shiny , ggplot2 , dplyr , tidyr , readr , magrittr , ggbeeswarm , readxl , DT ) . The source code of the current version ( v1 . 0 . 5 ) is archived at zenodo : https : / / doi . org / 10 . 5281 / zenodo . 2582567 . An up - to - date version is available at Github together with information on how to install and run the app locally : https : / / github . com / JoachimGoedhart / PlotsOfData . When the PlotsOfData R / shiny script is downloaded from Github , the web app can be started from R or Rstudio and used offline . Issues and updates The Github page of PlotsOfData can be used to trace changes between different versions . The page has a list with issues and feature requests ( https : / / github . com / JoachimGoedhart / PlotsOfData / issues ) that ( i ) is used to communicate issues in a clear way and ( ii ) provides a way to invite people to contribute and help to improve the code . Users of PlotsOfData can report an issue or request a feature on the Github page , or they can contact the developers by email or Twitter . Up - to - date contact information is found on the “About” page of the app . Data input and structure The data can be provided by copying and pasting into a text box or by upload of two file for - mats , i . e . , comma - separated values ( CSV ) or XLS ( X ) ( Excel ) format . Several delimiters ( comma , tab , semicolon , space ) are recognized . Two example files are available in the app for testing the application . These files are also available as CSV files ( https : / / github . com / JoachimGoedhart / PlotsOfData ) . Data may exist in different formats [ 10 ] . The native structure that ggplot2 uses is the “tidy” format [ 9 ] , and this data structure is accepted as input . However , ( raw ) data are often stored in a wide , spreadsheet - type structure in which each column reflects a condition . The different structures of the wide format and tidy format are illustrated in Fig 1 . This visual explanation is also available in the “Data upload” tab of the app . The wide format is the default data structure that is used by the app . Users may select columns from the spread - sheet data that should not be included in the graph . After the input , the wide data are con - verted into tidy format , assuming that each column is a condition with a single row header that lists each condition . To promote the understanding of tidy data , the data can be down - loaded in a tidy format . The defaults of the data input can be changed by adding input to the HTML address . The ? data = [ 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 ] ; [ T ] tag can be used to change the input and structure . The value between the brackets lists a choice for a parameter . For instance , the HTML address PLOS Biology | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pbio . 3000202 March 27 , 2019 2 / 8 below starts PlotsOfData with Data upload set to option 2 ( “Example 2” ) and tidy set to T ( TRUE ) for the input : https : / / huygens . science . uva . nl / PlotsOfData / ? data = 2 ; T . These instructions can also be found under the “About” tab , with a complete list of available input variables . Data visibility The data are shown as transparent dots . Offset can be added to the dots to avoids overlap for a larger number of dots . When quasirandom is selected as the offset , the dots are shown accord - ing to the data distribution ( i . e . , similar to a violin plot ) . Both the offset and user - defined visi - bility of the raw data can be adjusted to optimize the visualization of the raw data . For low numbers of data , it is pertinent to plot the data [ 1 , 3 , 11 ] . For very large numbers of data , i . e . , when the dots show substantial overlap , one may consider to make the data fully transparent and only plot their distribution with a violin plot . Statistical summary Any of four statistics can be added to summarize the data , i . e . , median , mean , box plot , or vio - lin plot . The median is not sensitive to outliers and as such is a robust indicator of the central value [ 12 ] . The median is also indicated in the box plot [ 13 ] and violin plot by a horizontal Fig 1 . The wide versus tidy data format . In the wide ( spreadsheet - like ) data format each column represents a condition . In the tidy format each column is a single variable and each row is an observation . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pbio . 3000202 . g001 PLOS Biology | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pbio . 3000202 March 27 , 2019 3 / 8 line . Because both box plots and violin plots reflect data distribution , they are only appropriate if sufficient data are provided ( the lower limit is now set at n = 10 ) . To enable inference by eye , the 95CI can be added to the plot [ 5 , 6 ] . For box plots , the 95CI is indicated by notches [ 13 ] . The original definition of notches was reported by McGill and colleagues , but their calculation does not correct for small sample size [ 13 ] . Therefore , notched box plots should be used with care for smaller samples ( n < 20 ) . The 95CI that is calculated when the median or violin plot is selected is calculated by boot - strapping ( 1 , 000 samples ) and determining the 95CI from the 2 . 5th and 97 . 5th percentile [ 14 ] . Because bootstrapping requires a representative sample from the population , it is only suitable if sufficient data are present . Because the underlying population that was sampled from is unknown , it is , per definition , unclear what “sufficient” means . To reduce the chances that the 95CI does not correctly reflect the population , we have set the minimum number of data points in the app at 10 per condition for the calculation of the 95CI . Users who want to add box plots , violin plots , or 95CI will be notified by a pop - up window that this is not possible due to small sample size . Fig 2 demonstrates the use of the median , a box plot , or a violin plot as a summary . The box plot and violin plot also convey information on the distribution of the data . In the lower row , the 95CI is depicted to make visual inferences . When the 95CIs of two independent con - ditions do not overlap , this is a strong indicator of a statistical difference between these condi - tions [ 5 ] . The difference can be quantified by calculating the effect size . Fig 2 . An overview of data visualizations generated using PlotsOfData . The sample data that are available in PlotsOfData are presented together with statistics in different ways . Upper row , a data - centered presentation , with prominent display of the data as dot plots and the statistics displayed with a visibility of 0 . 3 . Lower row , a statistics - centered presentation that shows the data at lower visibility ( 0 . 3 ) and prominently shows the statistics and the 95CIs . Horizontal lines ( or a circle in the lower left panel ) display the median value , and vertical bars show the 95CI . For box plots the 95CI is indicated by notches . 95CI , 95 % confidence interval . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pbio . 3000202 . g002 PLOS Biology | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pbio . 3000202 March 27 , 2019 4 / 8 Transparent layers The raw data can be combined with any of four data summaries , i . e . , mean , median , box plot , and violin plot . In addition , the 95CI can be added for inferences . The simultaneous visualiza - tion of the data and statistics is achieved by using ( transparent ) layers . For optimal visualiza - tion , the order of the layers is defined as follows ( from first to last , with last appearing on top ) : ( 1 ) box - or violin plot , ( 2 ) raw data , ( 3 ) mean or median , and ( 4 ) 95CI . The visualization can be optimized by user - defined visibility of the layers . Fig 2 demonstrates how the “visibility” of the data and statistics can be adjusted for a visualization that focusses on the data ( upper row ) or one that stresses the statistics ( lower row ) . A description of how these figures can be gener - ated with the app can be found in a supplemental note ( see S1 Text ) . Ordering The conditions can be sorted in three different ways . First , the conditions can be visualized in alphabetical order , which is the default order for ggplot2 . Second , the categories can be shown in the same order as provided ( by copy and paste or in the uploaded file ) . Third , the conditions can be sorted according to the median value . Table with statistics The statistics that are selected for visualizing the data are also documented in a table on a sepa - rate tab . The calculated statistics include the mean , standard deviation ( SD ) , standard error of the mean ( SEM ) , 95CI of the mean , median , median absolute deviation ( MAD ) , interquartile range ( IQR ) , quartile 1 ( Q1 ) , quartile 3 ( Q3 ) , and the 95CI of the median . The mean and median are measures of centrality and reflect the typical value of a distribution . The SD , IQR , and MAD are measures of dispersion that indicate the variability of a distribution . The SEM and 95CI are inferential statistics that are used to infer information about the population dis - tribution that the sample was taken from . The default statistics listed in the table depend on the summary statistics that are shown in the graph . For instance , when the mean is selected the mean and SD are shown in the table , but when the median is selected the median and the MAD are included . The user can change the default statistics that are shown in the table and rearrange their order by drag - and - drop - ping the columns . Moreover , the number of digits that is shown can be adjusted . The table can be exported in CSV or XLSX format , to PDF or copied to the clipboard . Fig 3 shows an output example of the statistical summary related to the data that are shown in Fig 2 . Plot layout To further optimize the data visualization , several options to change the layout of the plot have been implemented . The plot can be rotated 90 degrees , which generally improves readability of Fig 3 . The statistical summary of the data can be downloaded in several different formats . Here , the outputs for the data related to Fig 2 when downloaded as PDF are shown . IQR , interquartile range ; MAD , median absolute deviation ; 95CI , 95 % confidence interval . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pbio . 3000202 . g003 PLOS Biology | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pbio . 3000202 March 27 , 2019 5 / 8 the labels for the conditions . The grid can be removed . The scale can be adjusted , and there is an option for a log10 scale . In the default output , no colors are used . Color can be added to the data , the statistics , or both . There is an option to use the standard palette , or several color - blind safe palettes that are optimized for categorical , qualitative data ( https : / / personal . sron . nl / ~ pault / ) . Finally , user - defined colors can be added by using color names or hexadecimal codes . The user - defined col - ors are added to the conditions in the alphabetical order of the conditions , even if the condi - tions are shown in a different order . The labels for the axes and the plot title can be changed . The size of the plot and the font size can be modified . Finally , there is an option to add a figure caption . The caption responds dynamically when the plot is changed . An example of how the standard output can be modi - fied is shown in Fig 4 . The settings that are selected to generate a plot can be “cloned . ” This action will generate a HTML address that can be bookmarked . The customized HTML link will launch PlotsOfData with the user - specified settings . If the plot was generated with CSV data from a URL , the plot is automatically presented . In the case that the plot was made by adding the data with copy and paste or uploading a local file , the data need to be provided after launching PlotsOf - Data from the HTML address . S1 Text has more information on the parameters that can be passed through the HTML link . Output The graphs can be directly saved from the web browser that is running the app ( e . g . , by drag - and - drop from the web browser ) . Alternatively , two options are available for downloading the figure , PDF and PNG . The PNG format is lossless and can be readily converted to other bit - map - type formats that are suitable for presentation or incorporation into ( multi - panel ) figures . The PDF format is vector based and can be imported into any software package that handles vector - based graphics for further adjustment of the layout . The optional figure description can be copied via the clipboard to a text editor . Alternatively , it can be included with the plot by making a screenshot . Fig 4 . The layout of the graph generated by PlotsOfData can be further refined . The standard output of PlotsOfData ( left panel ) can be tuned to enhance the presentation . The graph on the right is generated by changing the visibility of the statistics , sorting of the conditions according to median value , rotating the plot , removing the grid , adjusting the scale , adding colors for the data , and adding a figure description . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pbio . 3000202 . g004 PLOS Biology | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pbio . 3000202 March 27 , 2019 6 / 8 The table with the summary can be copied to the clipboard and exported in several formats , including PDF , XLSX , or CSV . Conclusion PlotsOfData was generated with the aim to enable anyone to visualize their data in combina - tion with a selection of summaries . The user - defined mixing of dot plots with statistical sum - maries should improve the creation of graphs and visual inferences . The use of box plots , violin plots , and 95CI requires sufficient data . It is , however , not agreed upon what “sufficient” implies . In the app , the minimum is set at n = 10 for showing box plots , violin plots , and 95 % CI , but it is up to the user to critically assess whether this is sufficient . The source code for the app is available and the threshold can be readily changed in the code . Regardless of the statis - tics that are shown , it is recommended to plot the data for low to medium n [ 1 , 3 , 11 , 12 ] . Finally , we hope that the high - quality plots created with PlotsOfData will improve transpar - ent communication of scientific data , which will be beneficial for both researchers and their audience .
