Nolen 1 , * 1 Institute of Molecular Biology and Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , University of Oregon , Eugene , OR 97403 , USA Summary Background : Arp2 / 3 complex is a key actin cytoskeletal regu - lator that creates branched actin ﬁlament networks in response to cellular signals . WASP - activated Arp2 / 3 complex assembles branched actin networks by nucleating new ﬁla - ments from the sides of pre - existing ones . WASP - mediated activation requires seed ﬁlaments , to which the WASP - bound Arp2 / 3 complex can bind to form branches , but the source of the ﬁrst substrate ﬁlaments for branching is unknown . Results : Here we show that Dip1 , a member of the WISH / DIP / SPIN90 family of actin regulators , potently activates Arp2 / 3 complex without preformed ﬁlaments . Unlike other Arp2 / 3 complex activators , Dip1 does not bind actin monomers or ﬁl - aments , and it interacts with the complex using a non - WASP - like binding mode . In addition , Dip1 - activated Arp2 / 3 complex creates linear instead of branched actin ﬁlament networks . Conclusions : Our data show the mechanism by which Dip1 and other WISH / DIP / SPIN90 proteins can provide seed ﬁla - ments to Arp2 / 3 complex to serve as master switches in initi - ating branched actin assembly . This mechanism is distinct from other known activators of Arp2 / 3 complex . Introduction The dynamic meshworks of ﬁlaments that make up the actin cytoskeleton are tightly regulated to orchestrate complex cellular process like endocytosis and cellular motility . Poly - merization of actin ﬁlaments is limited by a slow nucleation step , in which the ﬁrst few actin monomers assemble to form a template for assembly of a new ﬁlament [ 1 ] . Cells contain multiple actin ﬁlament nucleators to regulate network assem - bly [ 2 ] , but Arp2 / 3 complex is the only one known to nucleate branched actin networks [ 3 ] . Its activity is tightly regulated , and there are currently about a dozen known Arp2 / 3 complex activators , called nucleation - promoting factors ( NPFs ) [ 3 , 4 ] . WASP / Scar family proteins , the best - studied NPFs , recruit actin monomers to Arp2 / 3 complex to stimulate an activating conformational change [ 5 , 6 ] . However , nucleation occurs only when the complex is bound to the side of a pre - existing ﬁlament [ 7 ] , ensuring that the complex creates exclusively branched actin networks . Once branching is initiated , Arp2 / 3 complex - nucleated ﬁlaments can serve as substrates to drive the reaction , but the source of the very ﬁrst substrate actin ﬁlaments remains an open question . Cellular concentrations of actin ﬁlaments are high , but distinct pools of ﬁlaments are coated with characteristic actin binding proteins that may inﬂuence their suitability as substrates for the complex [ 8 , 9 ] . For example , tropomyosin and coronin both bind to the sides of actin ﬁlaments and prevent them from activating Arp2 / 3 complex [ 10 , 11 ] . WISH / DIP / SPIN90 proteins are poorly understood actin regulators that interact with Arp2 / 3 complex [ 12 ] . SPIN90 , the mammalian ortholog , was previously shown to activate Arp2 / 3 complex , and based on sequence alignments it was hypothesized to be a WASP - like activator [ 12 ] . Consistent with this , knockdown of SPIN90 prevented PDGF - stimulated formation of lamelipodia and caused defects in actin organiza - tion [ 12 ] . In contrast , another study showed that mammalian WISH / DIP / SPIN90 could bind N - WASP to relieve its autoinhi - bition and induce activation of the Arp2 / 3 complex , but could not directly activate Arp2 / 3 complex [ 13 ] . Therefore , the role of WISH / DIP / SPIN90 proteins in regulating Arp2 / 3 complex is uncertain . In S . pombe , Dip1 regulates the timing of actin assembly in endocytic actin patches [ 14 ] . Actin patches are nucleated by Arp2 / 3 complex , and branched ﬁlaments in these networks are thought to drive endocytosis by providing the pushing forces to invaginate membranes and internalize endocytic ves - icles [ 15 ] . Normally , the S . pombe WASP protein , Wsp1 , arrives at endocytic sites 8 – 10 s before internalization and initiates a tightly controlled sequence of actin polymerization and recruitment of actin binding proteins [ 14 , 16 ] . In dip1 D cells , the timing of this process is random , with actin assembly and internalization sometimes being delayed by hundreds of seconds . This delay was hypothesized to result from the absence of suitable substrate actin ﬁlaments for Wsp1 - acti - vated branching nucleation [ 14 ] . These observations led us to ask how Dip1 can regulate the initiation of branched actin networks and how it might provide the initial substrate ﬁla - ments for Arp2 / 3 complex . Here we show that Dip1 directly activates Arp2 / 3 complex , but with a mechanism distinct from other NPFs . Dip1 does not interact with actin ﬁlaments or monomers like other NPFs , but instead uses a non - WASP - like interaction to bind to Arp2 / 3 complex and initiate an activating conformational change . Importantly , we show that Dip1 - mediated activation does not require preformed ﬁlaments , providing the biochem - ical mechanism by which Dip1 can control the timing of endo - cytic actin assembly . The biochemical properties of Dip1 are conserved in SPIN90 , suggesting that WISH / DIP / SPIN90 proteins may have a general role in providing seed ﬁlaments to initiate branching nucleation . Results S . pombe Dip1 Is a Potent Activator of Arp2 / 3 Complex The S . pombe WISH / DIP / SPIN90 ortholog Dip1 has a conserved leucine - rich domain ( LRD ) , but has neither a poly - proline region nor Src homology domain III ( SH3 ) present in other orthologs ( Figure 1A and Figure S1 available online ) . To determine whether Dip1 can inﬂuence the activity of Arp2 / 3 complex , we tested its activity in pyrene actin polymerization assays . Puriﬁed Dip1 dramatically increased polymerization rates in reactions containing Arp2 / 3 complex , but had no effect on reactions containing only actin , demonstrating that Dip1 * Correspondence : bnolen @ uoregon . edu activates Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 1B ) . Comparing the activa - tion potency of Dip1 to the canonical type I NPF from S . pombe , Wsp1 , revealed striking differences between these two activators . First , Dip1 is a more potent activator of Arp2 / 3 complex than Wsp1 . At saturation , the minimal construct of Wsp1 sufﬁcient to activate Arp2 / 3 complex , Wsp1 - VCA [ 17 ] , increased the maximum polymerization rate to a level 9 - fold higher than Arp2 / 3 complex alone . In contrast , near - saturating concentrations of Dip1 increased the maximum polymeriza - tion rate 40 - fold over Arp2 / 3 complex alone ( Figure 1C ) . At each concentration tested , Dip1 produced faster polymeriza - tion rates than the equivalent concentration of Wsp1 - VCA . With 50 nM Arp2 / 3 complex , saturating Wsp1 - VCA produced 0 . 7 nM barbed ends , while near - saturating Dip1 ( 20 m M ) pro - duced 1 . 3 nM ends ( Figure 1D ) . A second critical difference between the two NPFs is that at high concentrations , Wsp1 - VCA potently inhibits actin polymerization , whereas Dip1 did not slow accumulation of polymer even at concentrations up to 20 m M ( Figure 1C ) . VCA inhibits polymerization because its V region binds to actin monomers , preventing them from spon - taneously associating into nuclei [ 18 ] . That Dip1 does not slow polymerization suggests that it does not bind actin monomers A + 1 . 0 µ M Dip1 R F U Time ( s ) 6 . 0 4 . 0 2 . 0 200 400 600 800 actin 50 nM Arp2 / 3 + 200 nM Dip1 + 660 nM Dip1 + 1 . 5 µ M Dip1 + 5 . 0 µ M Dip1 + 13 . 3 µ M Dip1 B 0 . 0 0 C D 40 30 10 20 m a x po l y m i e r z a t i on r a t e ( n M / s ) [ NPF ] µ M 10 15 20 5 0 0 Dip1 VCA 25 SH3 polyproline Spin90 Dip1 Ldb17 160 216 1 339 373 LRD W184 W362 691 722 546 54 171 247 W401 439492 1 376 237 E R F U [ B a r bed E n d s ] n M 1 . 0 0 . 5 0 . 0 0 100 200 300 53 1 . 5 0 . 75 0 . 5 0 . 2 0 . 1 Time ( s ) Time ( s ) 6 . 0 4 . 0 2 . 0 0 . 0 0 600 800 actin VCA Dip1 VCA + Dip1 1 190 Figure 1 .

See also Figure S1 . like VCA and that it may use a different mechanism to activate Arp2 / 3 complex . Finally , addition of a GST tag to Dip1 did not increase its potency ( Figure S1 ) . This is in contrast to WASP family proteins , which show increased activity upon induced oligomerization [ 19 ] . Wsp1 and Dip1 colocalize to endo - cytic actin patches , and both contribute to the assembly of actin ﬁlament net - works in patches [ 14 ] . To determine whether these NPFs can cooperate to assemble actin ﬁlaments in vitro , we added Dip1 to a pyrene actin poly - merization assay containing Wsp1 and Arp2 / 3 complex . Dip1 increased the maximum polymerization rate 2 . 5 - fold over reactions containing Arp2 / 3 complex activated by Wsp1 alone , suggesting that Dip1 and Wsp1 can act either additively or synergistically ( Figure 1E ) . To explore further , we preincubated Arp2 / 3 complex with saturating Dip1 and a range of concentra - tions of GST - Wsp1 - VCA before initiating polymerization assays . GST - Wsp1 - VCA did not increase the maximum poly - merization rate , and at high concentrations it slowed polymer - ization ( Figure S1 ) . These data indicate that Dip1 and Wsp1 are unlikely to synergistically activate the complex by simulta - neously engaging it . The decreased polymerization rates at high concentrations of GST - Wsp1 - VCA could be due to a number of factors , including competition of the two NPFs for binding to the complex , or slowed spontaneous or induced nucleation from Wsp1 - bound actin monomers . Dip1 Activates Arp2 / 3 Complex without Preformed Actin Filaments Because WASP - mediated activation of Arp2 / 3 complex re - quires binding of the complex to a preformed ﬁlament , accu - mulation of branched ﬁlaments proceeds through a lag phase caused by slow spontaneous nucleation [ 18 ] . However , exam - ination of the polymerization time courses revealed that the lag phase of Dip1 - activated Arp2 / 3 complex was insigniﬁcant Dip1 Seeds Assembly of Branched Actin Networks 1991 compared to the lag we observed with GST - Wsp1 - VCA acti - vated Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 2A ) . An important consequence of the requirement for preformed ﬁlaments is that WASP - acti - vated Arp2 / 3 complex speciﬁcally nucleates branched actin ﬁlaments . To determine whether Dip1 activates Arp2 / 3 com - plex without requiring preformed ﬁlaments , we used total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy to visualize actin polymerization in the presence or absence of Arp2 / 3 complex , with or without Dip1 or Wsp1 - VCA ( Movies S1 and S2 ) . As expected , Arp2 / 3 complex activated by Wsp1 - VCA produced branched ﬁlaments ( Figures 2B and 2C and Movie S1 ) . In contrast , Dip1 - activated Arp2 / 3 complex produced many short , linear ﬁlaments that did not branch , indicating that preformed ﬁlaments are not required for activation of the complex ( Figures 2B and 2C and Movies S1 and S2 ) . The accumulation of ﬁlamentous actin in TIRF assays was acceler - ated in reactions containing Dip1 - versus Wsp1 - VCA - acti - vated Arp2 / 3 complex , consistent with the absence of a lag phase observed in bulk assays ( Figures 2A and 2D ) . Filaments nucleated by Dip1 and Arp2 / 3 complex elongated from their barbed ends at the same rate as reactions containing Wsp1 - VCA and Arp2 / 3 complex or actin alone , consistent with our conclusion that Dip1 acts directly on the complex rather than actin ﬁlament barbed ends ( Figure 2E ) . To provide additional evidence that actin ﬁlaments are not required for Dip1 - Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated nucleation , we tested the inﬂuence of the Arp2 / 3 complex inhibitor protein coronin on Dip1 activity . Coronin binds to actin ﬁlament sides and blocks Arp2 / 3 complex from associating , thereby inhibit - ing nucleation [ 10 ] . We reasoned that if Dip1 - mediated activa - tion of Arp2 / 3 complex does not require actin ﬁlament side binding , coronin will not antagonize Dip1 . Indeed , we found that coronin had no effect on Dip1 - mediated activation of the complex in pyrene actin polymerization assays , but blocked Wsp1 - VCA - mediated activation ( Figure 3A ) . As an additional test , we asked whether increased concentrations of actin ﬁla - ment side binding sites stimulate Dip1 activity . Preformed actin ﬁlaments did not signiﬁcantly affect the polymerization rate in a reaction containing Dip1 and Arp2 / 3 complex , but eliminated the lag phase in a reaction containing Wsp1 - VCA and Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figure 3B ) . These data demonstrate that Dip1 does not require preformed ﬁlaments to active Arp2 / 3 complex . Dip1 Uses a Mechanism Distinct from Known Type I or Type II NPFs to Activate Arp2 / 3 Complex NPFs have been separated into two categories : type I NPFs , which bind to Arp2 / 3 complex and actin monomers , and type II NPFs , which bind Arp2 / 3 complex and ﬁlamentous actin [ 3 ] . Importantly , the actin binding speciﬁcity affects the mech - anism by which Arp2 / 3 is activated . Recruitment of actin monomers to the complex by WASP - VCA , the canonical type I NPF , stimulates formation of a ﬁlament - like ‘‘short - pitch’’ conformation of the Arp2 - Arp3 subunits , thereby stimulating Figure 2 .

See also Movies S1 and S2 . Current Biology Vol 23 No 20 1992 nucleation activity [ 5 , 6 ] . Less is known about how type II NPFs regulate the complex , but their ﬁlament binding domains are important for activation [ 3 , 20 ] . To determine how Dip1 acti - vates the complex , we tested its interactions with actin . Dip1 did not interact with actin monomers in a pull - down assay or a native gel shift assay , suggesting that it does not recruit actin monomers to Arp2 / 3 complex ( Figures 4A and 4B ) . We next tested the ability of Dip1 to interact with actin ﬁlaments . Dip1 did not copellet with actin ﬁlaments at any concentration we tested , up to 4 . 9 m M , whereas w 99 % of the prototypical type II NPF , cortactin , copelleted with 4 . 9 m M actin ﬁlaments ( Figure 4C ) . That Dip1 does not interact with either actin monomers or ﬁlaments demonstrates that it uses a different mechanism than known type I or type II NPFs . Because Dip1 activates Arp2 / 3 complex but does not interact with ﬁlaments or monomers , we hypothesized that it might interact directly with Arp2 / 3 complex to inﬂuence its activity . To test this , we used GST - tagged Dip1 to pull down Arp2 / 3 complex . Dip1 at 8 m M pulled down 20 % of a 1 . 14 m M solution of Arp2 / 3 complex , showing the two proteins interact directly ( Figure 4D ) . Dip1 bound weakly to the complex compared to GST - Wsp1 - VCA , and we did not saturate bind - ing . This observation is consistent with our actin polymeri - zation assays , which show the concentration at which Dip1 reaches half maximal activation is approximately 6 - fold greater than Wsp1 - VCA ( Figure 1C ) . Proﬂin binds actin monomers to catalyze nucleotide exchange and inhibit spontaneous nucleation of ﬁlaments [ 21 , 22 ] . In addition , proﬁlin has been shown to inhibit activa - tion of Arp2 / 3 complex by some WASP / Scar family proteins [ 23 , 24 ] . To determine whether proﬁlin affects Dip1 - mediated activation of Arp2 / 3 complex , we added excess proﬁlin to pyr - ene actin polymerization assays . Proﬁlin at 7 . 5 m M decreased the number of barbed ends created by 5 m M Dip1 and 50 nM Arp2 / 3 complex from 0 . 38 to 0 . 12 nM ( Figure 4E ) . This is more than the proﬁlin - induced decrease in spontaneously nucleated ends ( 0 . 082 nM to 0 . 02 nM ) , suggesting that while Dip1 can activate Arp2 / 3 complex even in excess proﬁlin , pro - ﬁlin may have a direct effect on Dip1 - mediated activation of the complex that slows down nucleation . Dip1 Does Not Have a WASP - like CA Region Sequence analysis suggested that SPIN90 , the mammalian or - tholog of Dip1 , has a CA - like region that might interact with and activate Arp2 / 3 complex using the same mechanism as WASP VCA [ 12 ] ( Figure S2 ) . The A sequence in WASP / Scar proteins consists of a conserved tryptophan surrounded by variable numbers of acidic residues [ 25 ] . Previous data have shown that the trypotophan in the A region of WASP forms a contact with Arp2 / 3 complex important for binding and activation [ 26 – 28 ] . Analysis of the Dip1 sequence revealed two trypto - phans , W184 and W382 ( Figures 1A and S2 ) . To ask whether either tryptophan marks a potential A region that could allow Dip1 to make a WASP - like interaction with the complex , we singly mutated each tryptophan to alanine . Neither tryptophan mutant affected Dip1 activity ( Figure 4F ) . Therefore , we conclude that Dip1 does not interact with Arp2 / 3 complex using a WASP - like binding mode . Dip1 Stimulates Formation of the Short Pitch Arp2 - Arp3 Dimer Our data show that Dip1 activates the complex but does bind with signiﬁcant afﬁnity to actin monomers , and does not interact with the complex using a WASP - like binding mode . Therefore , we asked whether Dip1 could stimulate formation of the short pitch conformation using a mechanism distinct from WASP . To test this , we used a previously described dou - ble cysteine mutant of budding yeast Arp2 / 3 complex [ 6 ] . This mutant harbors engineered cysteine residues on Arp2 and Arp3 that can be crosslinked upon activation of the complex , when Arp2 and Arp3 adopt a short pitch ﬁlament - like confor - mation . Dip1 activates budding yeast Arp2 / 3 complex , so this assay can be used to determine the inﬂuence of Dip1 on formation of the short pitch conformation ( Figure S3 ) . We added the 8 A˚ crosslinker bismaleimideoethane ( BMOE ) to the engineered complex in the presence of Dip1 or N - WASP - VCA . Dip1 at 30 m M increased the formation of the short pitch crosslink 3 . 5 - fold over Arp2 / 3 complex alone ( Figure 5 ) . Previ - ous data showed that N - WASP - VCA alone weakly shifts the population toward the active state , but that actin monomers and VCA cooperate to strongly induce the short pitch confor - mation [ 6 ] . In contrast , we found that actin monomers did not increase population of the short pitch conformation stimulated by Dip1 ( Figure 5 ) . Together , our data indicate that Dip1 activates Arp2 / 3 complex by stimulating formation of the short - pitch conformation , using a mechanism distinct from WASP . The Mechanism of Activation of Arp2 / 3 Complex Is Conserved among WISH / DIP / SPIN90 Proteins To determine which regions of Dip1 are required for activation , we tested the ability of Dip1 truncations to activate Arp2 / 3 Figure 3 .

Dip1 Seeds Assembly of Branched Actin Networks 1993 complex . An N - terminal deletion construct starting at residue 160 , Dip1 ( 160 – 374 ) , retained nearly full activity ( Figures 1A , 6A , and S1 ) . This result is consistent with the lack of conserva - tion of the N - terminal sequences among WISH / DIP / SPIN90 family proteins . Unexpectedly , the region C - terminal to the LRD domain , which is also poorly conserved , was required for activity ( Figure 6A ) . However , truncation of the C - terminal sequence resulted in a poorly behaved protein with low solubi - lity and a propensity to aggregate ( data not shown ) . Therefore , this region could be important for protein stability , may be directly involved in activating Arp2 / 3 complex , or both . A construct lacking the N - terminal 19 residues of the LRD domain , Dip1 ( 216 – 374 ) , was also inactive , consistent with the importance of the LRD in activation of Arp2 / 3 complex . Because the LRD domain is conserved in all WISH / DIP / SPIN90 proteins , we hypothesized that the mechanism of Dip1 - mediated activation of the complex might be conserved . As previously reported , human SPIN90 activated the complex [ 12 ] ( Figure 6B ) . Activation required relatively high concentra - tions , but like Dip1 , SPIN90 - mediated activation occurred without a signiﬁcant lag phase . SPIN90 - mediated activation of Arp2 / 3 complex was not inhibited by coronin , and addition of preformed ﬁlaments did not increase activation of the com - plex by SPIN90 ( Figures 6C and 6D ) . SPIN90 - activated Arp2 / 3 complex produced linear instead of branched actin ﬁlaments in a TIRF microscopy assay , in contrast to a previous report ( Figure 6E and Movies S3 and S4 ) [ 29 ] . These data demon - strate that like Dip1 , SPIN90 does not require preformed actin ﬁlaments to activate Arp2 / 3 complex . It was previously re - ported that SPIN90 harbors a V region similar to WASP pro - teins that allows it to interact with actin monomers , suggesting that it may use a WASP - like activation mechanism [ 12 ] . However , our sequence analysis indicates that the proposed V region in SPIN90 has signiﬁcant differences from other Figure 4 .

The concentration of Dip1 in ( F ) is 5 m M . See also Figure S2 . Current Biology Vol 23 No 20 1994 V - region - containing proteins ( Figure S4 ) . We also found substantial biochemical differences between WASP - V and the proposed SPIN90 V region . For instance , SPIN90 did not interact with actin monomers in a native gel shift assay , unlike N - WASP - VCA ( Figure 4B ) . In addition , while high concentra - tions of WASP - VCA inhibited actin monomers from spon - taneously nucleating ( Figure 1C ) , SPIN90 did not inhibit spontaneous nucleation at the highest concentrations we tested , up to 27 . 4 m M ( Figure 6F ) . Together , our data suggest that WISH / DIP / SPIN90 proteins use a conserved mechanism , distinct from other NPFs , that allows them to activate Arp2 / 3 complex without requiring preformed ﬁlaments . Discussion Here we show that Dip1 deﬁnes a distinct class of NPFs that directly bind and activate Arp2 / 3 complex . Dip1 is distinct from other NPFs in that it does not bind actin monomers or ﬁl - aments , and does not contain an Arp2 / 3 complex - interacting CA ( or A ) region . The biochemical properties of Dip1 explain its ability to serve as the master timer in initiating the assembly of branched actin ﬁlaments during endocytosis . Based on our data , and on the work of Basu et al . and others , we propose the following model for Dip1 function in actin patch assembly ( Fig - ure 7 ) . Dip1 and Wsp1 are recruited to endocytic sites 8 to 10 s before internalization [ 14 , 16 ] . Actin cables are nucleated by the formin For3 at the poles , where they could potentially seed branching nucleation [ 30 , 31 ] , but are coated with tropo - myosin [ 32 – 34 ] , so they likely cannot serve as substrates for Wsp1 - mediated Arp / 3 complex nucleation [ 11 ] . Dip1 binds Arp2 / 3 complex , stimulating nucleation of unbranched ﬁla - ments that provide seeds for Wsp1 - mediated Arp2 / 3 complex activation . This model predicts that tropomyosin does not block Dip1 - nucleated ﬁlaments from activating Wsp1 - bound Arp2 / 3 complex , though we cannot currently explain why . Wsp1 - activated branching creates more substrates for nucle - ation , resulting in a positive feedback loop that causes rapid assembly of the actin network . Deletion of Dip1 destroys the timing mechanism and initiation of the network becomes dependent on the stochastic encounter of Wsp1 - Arp2 / 3 complex with rare suitable actin ﬁlament substrates [ 14 ] . Our data show that Dip1 binds directly to Arp2 / 3 complex to stimulate formation of the short pitch conformation . Dip1 does not contain a CA region to bind Arp2 / 3 complex , and instead uses a non - WASP - like interaction to initiate this conforma - tional change . We hypothesize that once the Dip1 - Arp2 / 3 complex is in the short pitch conformation , actin monomers can associate with the barbed ends of both Arp2 and Arp3 , creating a ﬁlament with a blocked pointed end and a barbed end that elongates at the same rate as spontaneously nucle - ated ﬁlaments . This mechanism is consistent with our elonga - tion rate measurements and with structural and biochemical data indicating that Arp2 / 3 complex binds to the pointed end of the ﬁlaments it nucleates [ 35 , 36 ] . Importantly , we showed that like Dip1 , SPIN90 activates Arp2 / 3 complex without pre - formed ﬁlaments . In addition , our data demonstrated that SPIN90 does not harbor a WASP - like V region and binds actin monomers weakly or not at all . Together , these data indicate that SPIN90 and Dip1 use a common mechanism to activate Arp2 / 3 complex that is likely conserved among WISH / DIP / SPIN90 proteins . One potentially important difference be - tween SPIN90 and Dip1 is that SPIN90 contains a polyproline segment . While this segment is not required for SPIN90 activity ( Figures 6B and 6C ) , it will be important to determine whether it interacts with proﬁlin - bound actin and how this interaction could inﬂuence Arp2 / 3 complex activation . Multiple lines of evidence suggest that Wsp1 is the dominant NPF in controlling the architecture of endocytic actin patches . First , electron microscopy of the patches show Arp2 / 3 com - plex nucleates a densely branched network of short ( 19 – 38 subunit ) ﬁlaments [ 37 , 38 ] , more similar to the Wsp1 - initiated networks than to the unbranched Dip1 - activated networks that we observed in vitro . Second , deletion of dip1 inﬂuences the timing of patch initiation , but not patch assembly or inter - nalization after initiation , whereas wsp1 deletion strains have defective patches that fail to internalize [ 14 ] . An important question is how Wsp1 is maintained as the dominant NPF in vivo , despite the ability of Dip1 to strongly activate the complex . One possibility is that the concentration of Dip1 is relatively low in patches , allowing it to remain active during assembly without signiﬁcantly decreasing branch density . Consistent with this hypothesis , there are approximately 20 molecules of Dip1 per patch compared to about 150 Wsp1 molecules [ 14 ] . It is also possible that Dip1 activity is down regulated after initiation of the actin network as Wsp1 becomes active . A key ﬁnding of this work is that Dip1 does not require pre - formed actin ﬁlaments to activate Arp2 / 3 complex , unlike other NPFs tested [ 7 , 18 ] . This observation suggests that at least in some cases , cells use WISH / DIP / SPIN90 , a specialized NPF , to create substrate ﬁlaments , instead of relying on nucleation machinery that functions independently of Arp2 / 3 complex .

See also Figure S3 . Dip1 Seeds Assembly of Branched Actin Networks 1995 In actin patches , Dip1 may be better suited to initiate patch assembly than independently functioning nucleators . As previ - ously mentioned , formin - nucleated ﬁlaments may not provide suitable ﬁlament substrates because they are coated with tropomyosin [ 11 , 33 ] . In addition , formins remain at elongating ﬁlament barbed ends , preventing capping protein from block - ing ends to keep ﬁlaments short [ 39 ] . Dip1 likely acts at the pointed end of ﬁlaments , so it may not inﬂuence barbed end capping . In budding yeast , Las17 , the WASP / Scar family protein , was recently reported to contain a polyproline segment that nucleates actin ﬁlaments without requiring preformed branches or Arp2 / 3 complex [ 40 ] . Mutation of these segments caused a phenotype distinct from the dip1 knockout , extending the lifetime of the patches at the mem - brane and increasing the percentage of patches that fail to internalize . It will be important to determine whether this segment works in concert with Ldb17 , the budding yeast WISH / DIP / SPIN90 protein , or whether the actin patch defects observed result from an inability of Las17 to deliver proﬁlin - bound actin monomers to Arp2 / 3 complex . It will also be important to determine how short diffusing ﬁlaments severed by coﬁlin from disassembling patches might also play a role in initiating new patch assembly [ 41 ] . In endocytic actin patches , there are four known Arp2 / 3 complex activators ( Pan1 , Dip1 , Myo1 , Wsp1 ) in ﬁssion yeast and six ( Pan1 , Myo3 , Myo5 , Las17 , Crn1 , and Abp1 ) in S . cerevisiae [ 10 , 42 , 43 ] . While there are partial redundancies between some of these activators , mounting evidence sug - gests intricate but critical division of duties for these NPFs [ 17 , 44 ] . Here we show that Wsp1 and Dip1 use different biochemical mechanisms to activate Arp2 / 3 complex , explain - ing how they carry out distinct functions in the assembly of branched actin networks during endocytosis . A similar division of duties may occur in other branched networks that contain multiple NPFs . Dissecting the biochemical underpinnings that allow multiple Arp2 / 3 complex regulators to coordinately regulate a single branched actin network will be critical for our understanding of complex cellular processes like endocy - tosis and cellular motility .
