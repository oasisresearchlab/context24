JCB JCB : Review 53 The Rockefeller University Press $ 30 . 00 J . Cell Biol . Vol . 216 No . 1 53 – 63 https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1083 / jcb . 201610011 Introduction Biologists eager to exploit the promises of a fast - moving field are quickly adopting superresolution ( SR ) microscopy ( SRM ) , primarily using commercial SR microscopes . SRM is a tech - nique that can greatly reward the rigorous user but has the potential to punish the casual user . To achieve optimal and re - producible results , SRM requires careful planning of specimen preparation , rigorous attention to instrument optimization and image acquisition , and a thorough understanding of the practi - cal limitations , sources of error , and artifacts . Our perspective on SRM comes from running core fa - cilities in which we offer advice and training on commercial SRM instruments to a large and diverse research community and from teaching SRM in courses within and outside of our home institution . Our discussions with biologists interested in using SRM often reveal misunderstandings of the challenges we discuss in this review . Surveying the rapidly growing body of publications that use SRM to address biological questions raises multiple causes for concern . There is dramatic variability in the quality of published SRM images , even among publica - tions with images of the same sample with the same reported resolution , so we begin our discussion with image acquisition and specimen preparation parameters that affect resolution and image quality . Some publications report theoretically impos - sible resolutions ; we discuss the difficulties in estimating the resolution achieved in SRM images and review different meth - ods that can be used . There are publications containing SRM images with avoidable artifacts , or that do not report critical controls or image corrections . We review sources of artifacts and errors that must be addressed to generate accurate and re - producible SRM data and methods of optimizing SRM using standards and quantitative metrics . The trade - offs made to achieve multiwavelength , 3D , and live - cell SRM are not always clear in publications ; we discuss compromises inherent to these methods . Some published studies include SRM figures with image scale bars that reveal that diffraction - limited microscopy would have been sufficient . We conclude our review with sug - gestions for when diffraction - limited microscopy methods may be a better choice than SRM . We hope the practical advice in this review will help pre - vent possibly inaccurate and irreproducible data from being published unintentionally . Our goal is to provide information and resources to help biologists design SR experiments and save them time and frustration in the laboratory and limited fi - nancial resources . In addition , because publications are often reviewed and read by scientists who are experts in the relevant biological field but do not necessarily have expertise in every technique used in a study , we aim to provide a helpful resource to those reviewing or reading publications that use SRM . We focus primarily on SRM methods that are commer - cially available and are currently the most highly represented in biology publications : single - molecule localization microscopy ( SMLM ; e . g . , stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy [ STO RM ] , direct STO RM [ dSTO RM ] , photoactivated local - ization microscopy [ PALM ] , ground state depletion [ GSD ] , and point accumulation for imaging of nanoscale topography [ PAI NT ] ) , stimulated emission depletion ( STED ) , and struc - tured illumination microscopy ( SIM ; and 3D SIM ) . Each has been described in detail in reviews ( Huang et al . , 2009 ; Scher - melleh et al . , 2010 ; Toomre and Bewersdorf , 2010 ; Galbraith In 2014 , the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to three scientists who have made groundbreaking contribu - tions to the field of superresolution ( SR ) microscopy ( SRM ) . The first commercial SR microscope came to market a de - cade earlier , and many other commercial options have followed . As commercialization has lowered the barrier to using SRM and the awarding of the Nobel Prize has drawn attention to these methods , biologists have begun adopting SRM to address a wide range of questions in many types of specimens . There is no shortage of reviews on the fundamental principles of SRM and the remarkable achievements made with these methods . We approach SRM from another direction : we focus on the current prac - tical limitations and compromises that must be made when designing an SRM experiment . We provide information and resources to help biologists navigate through com - mon pitfalls in SRM specimen preparation and optimiza - tion of image acquisition as well as errors and artifacts that may compromise the reproducibility of SRM data .

Where applicable , we also discuss variants of image - scanning microscopy ( ISM ) methods ( Sheppard , 1988 ; Müller and Enderlein , 2010 ; Sheppard et al . , 2013 ; York et al . , 2013 ) , some of which have recently been commercialized . Superresolution requires superoptimization When SRM developers demonstrate the resolution of their tech - niques , they rigorously optimize sample preparation using their ( usually custom built ) microscopes , carefully correcting for sources of error . It is possible to use a commercial instrument and achieve the resolution reported by the developers ( Dem - merle et al . , 2015 ) , but only after learning and applying the nec - essary optimization procedures . We would all like scientific discovery to come more eas - ily . Commercial manufacturers are thus incentivized to pres - ent their SRM instruments as easy to use . But ease sometimes comes at the cost of rigor , and the SRM developers’ efforts to maximize resolution and ensure accuracy in their methods are often underappreciated by the company’s technical representa - tives , who frequently serve as researchers’ primary source of information and training . Resolution reported by the SRM de - velopers in publications and the commercial instrument man - ufacturers in marketing literature is usually based on the best possible results achievable under strictly limited conditions in an optimized sample . In practice , the reported SRM resolution limits are never guaranteed and do not apply to all biological samples and experiments . Careful and consistent attention to the various parameters that degrade resolution is critical to achieving optimal results . For every diffraction - limited and SRM method , one can find an equation that defines the theoretical resolution limit of the technique ( see supplement Li et al . , 2015 ) . In every case , however , there are additional practical limitations on resolution not included in these equations that , if not addressed , can de - crease the achievable resolution for the particular microscope , specimen , and imaging conditions used . The practical limita - tions on diffraction - limited resolution have long been appreci - ated and include signal to noise ratio ( SNR ) , contrast , optical aberrations , and sampling rate ( Stelzer , 1998 ) . These limita - tions and more apply to SRM . SNR and contrast . SNR is the intensity of the signal of interest divided by the variance in the signal due to noise . Fluorophore choice strongly affects SNR , and fluorophores that yield sufficient signal for diffraction - limited microscopy may not provide sufficient signal for SRM . For SIM and ISM , brightness and photostability are critically important for ob - taining the high SNR required for optimal reconstruction . Lo - calization precision in SMLM is strictly dependent on SNR , as it is limited by the number of photons collected from single fluorophores ( Thompson et al . , 2002 ; Rust et al . , 2006 ; Mortensen et al . , 2010 ; Deschout et al . , 2014 ) . STED and SMLM additionally require fluorophores for which the transi - tion between fluorescent and dark states can be tightly con - trolled during image acquisition ( contrast ratio , elaborated below ) , and only a limited number of fluorophores fulfill both switching and brightness demands ( Dempsey et al . , 2011 ; Na - hidiazar et al . , 2016 ) . The importance of fluorophore choice cannot be overstated . For any SRM method , it is well worth the effort of staying up to date as better fluorescent proteins and organic dyes are developed ( examples of notable recent developments include Wurm et al . , 2012 ; Lukinavi č ius et al . , 2013 ; Shaner et al . , 2013 ; Grimm et al . , 2015 ) . Image contrast can be defined as the difference between the intensity of the signal of interest and the background . Out - of - focus fluorescence is a common source of background and imposes limitations on SRM . SMLM often requires the use of total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ; Axelrod , 2001 ) or highly inclined and laminated optical sheet ( HILO ) illumi - nation ( Tokunaga et al . , 2008 ) to reduce out - of - focus fluores - cence ; these methods restrict excitation and image acquisition to within a few microns of the coverslip . In SIM , both low SNR and high background can lead to artifacts . TIRF - SIM ( Fiolka et al . , 2008 ) greatly increases contrast while restricting imag - ing depth to ≤ 200 nm from the coverslip , whereas 3D SIM is best suited to bright samples with minimal out - of - focus fluores - cence . STED and ISM microscopes typically use a pinhole to reduce the collection of out - of - focus fluorescence and may be the only viable option for thicker specimens . Optical aberrations . Optical aberrations degrade image quality and affect resolution in diffraction - limited mi - croscopy and SRM ( Keller , 2006 ; Goodwin , 2007 ; Booth et al . , 2015 ) . The effect of aberrations on SRM can be dramatic and , if ignored , can lead to false and irreproducible results . Field - and depth - dependent aberrations have been shown to lead to SMLM localization errors as large as 50 – 100 nm ( McGorty et al . , 2014 ; Carlini et al . , 2015 ; von Diezmann et al . , 2015 ) , and simulations show that aberrations can reduce SMLM localization precision twofold , introduce localization inaccuracies of many tens of nanometers , and lead to false positives ( Coles et al . , 2016 ) . In STED , aberrations can increase the inner diameter of the deple - tion ring and / or result in depletion of emission at what should be the zero point of the depletion beam , resulting in a STED microscope that performs no better or even worse than a confo - cal ( Deng et al . , 2010 ; Booth et al . , 2015 ) . Aberrations may be introduced by optics ( Goodwin , 2007 ) or the specimen ( Egner and Hell , 2006 ) . To achieve the highest resolution , microscopes must be set up to minimize aberrations for each sample . Speci - mens should be mounted as close as possible to the coverslip and , for fixed specimens , in a medium with a refractive index similar to coverslip glass ( Goodwin , 2007 ) . Learning to recog - nize and reduce aberrations is the responsibility of the micro - scope user because no optical system is capable of minimizing all aberrations simultaneously for all samples . We discuss two common aberrations , spherical and chromatic . Spherical aberration is caused when light waves travel - ing through the periphery of a lens focus to a different plane than those passing closer to the center . Spherical aberration broadens the point spread function ( PSF ) both axially and laterally and decreases intensity values ( Fig . 1 ) . In SMLM , spherical aberration reduces localization precision and resolu - tion and complicates some 3D localization methods ( McGorty et al . , 2014 ) . In SIM , it decreases resolution by degrading il - lumination pattern contrast and raw image SNR and increases the likelihood of artifacts ( Ball et al . , 2015 ) . Minimizing spherical aberration can be complicated , as it is affected by many variables : temperature , wavelength , coverslip thickness , focal plane depth , and refractive index mismatch between the lens immersion media and the specimen ( North , 2006 ) . Re - fractive index matching ( Hiraoka et al . , 1990 ) or objective lens correction collars ( Ross et al . , 2014 ) can be used to minimize spherical aberration for a given combination of these variables across a specific and limited range of focal depths . Spherical Superresolution microscopy • lambert and Waters 55 aberration cannot be simultaneously corrected across multiple wavelengths ( Fig . 1 ) , so users should focus their efforts on the most important fluorophore in multichannel imaging or accept an intermediate compromise . Chromatic aberration is a difference in focal point and lat - eral coordinates between wavelengths and is inherent in any op - tical system . Chromatic aberration must be addressed to ensure that depletion and excitation lasers are aligned in STED . Opti - mizing SNR in 2D and TIRF - SIM often requires using multi - ple cameras positioned at the different focal planes of multiple emission wavelengths . Most importantly , chromatic aberrations impose the need for postacquisition image registration for all SRM modalities ( see Multiwavelength imaging section ) . Fluorophore labeling density . Labeling density re - fers to the distance between fluorophores in a specimen . In dif - fraction - limited microscopy , the image of a single fluorophore is more than two orders of magnitude larger than the fluoro - phore , so the impact of labeling density is minimal , as even sparsely labeled structures can appear continuous . As resolution increases , inadequate labeling density can result in a confusing or misleading speckled appearance in structures that are actu - ally continuous ( Fig . 2 ) , limiting biologically meaningful reso - lution . Shroff et al . ( 2008 ) explained that the distance between fluorophores must be less than half the desired resolution ( Ny - quist sampling ; Shannon , 1949 ) and used simulations of various labeling densities to demonstrate this principle ( also see supple - ment Legant et al . , 2016 ) . To achieve 20 - nm resolution , for ex - ample , there must be a fluorophore bound at least every 10 nm ; given the stochastic nature of probe binding , ensuring this label - ing density across the field of view ( FOV ) can require a mean density of 5 – 10× the Nyquist rate ( Legant et al . , 2016 ) . Because an IgG antibody is ∼ 10 nm , reaching the labeling densities re - quired to achieve the highest theoretical SRM resolution limits may be impossible with standard immunofluorescence proto - cols ( Fig . 2 ) . Using primary and fluorescently labeled second - ary antibodies limits practical resolution to ≥ 40 nm ( Weber et al . , 1978 ; Demmerle et al . , 2015 ) , making directly labeled pri - mary antibodies preferable . Labeling density requirements highlight the need for smaller probes that bind close to structures of interest , such as nanobodies ( Fig . 2 ; Fernández - Suárez and Ting , 2008 ; Opazo et al . , 2012 ; Ries et al . , 2012 ) , or imaging approaches that reduce the effect of steric hindrances . In PAI NT , transient binding of freely diffusing probes can effectively increase the achievable labeling density ( Sharonov and Hochstrasser , 2006 ) . PAI NT usually requires TIRF / HILO ( Giannone et al . , 2010 ) or light - sheet ( Legant et al . , 2016 ) illumination to reduce background from freely diffusing fluorophores . The number of bright tar - get - specific PAI NT probes is limited but is an active field of de - velopment ( Kiuchi et al . , 2015 ) . PAI NT has been used to image chromatin using fluorescently labeled oligomers ( Boettiger et al . , 2016 ) , but applying similar DNA - encoded labeling strate - gies to protein targets ( Jungmann et al . , 2014 ) currently requires antibody intermediates . Contrast ratio . To accurately localize molecules in SMLM , individual fluorophore emission events must be sepa - rated in time . The time a fluorophore resides in the dark versus fluorescent states ( and the relative intensity of inactivated and activated forms of photoswitchable proteins ) is referred to as contrast ratio . Even when labeling density requirements are Figure 1 . Spherical aberration cannot be simultaneously corrected across all wavelengths and lowers image SNR . ( A – D ) γ - Enhanced PSF xz views of the same multicolor fluorescent microsphere ( TetraSpeck ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) imaged at different emission wavelengths ( 528 / 48 nm and 683 / 40 nm ) using different refractive index immersion oils . ( A and D ) Op - timized PSFs are symmetric in z , with confined central maxima . ( B and C ) Spherical aberration results in axial asymmetry and broadening of the PSF . xy images ( insets in B and D ) show reduced signal intensity collected at the focal plane resulting from spherical aberration ( linear intensity pseudocol - oring heat map displayed to the right ) . Figure 2 . The effect of large probe size and low labeling density . ( A ) The relatively large size of antibodies can both cause steric hindrances that reduce labeling density and increase the distance between the fluorophore and the structure of interest . ( B ) Smaller probes may allow for higher la - beling density and bring fluorophores closer to the structure of interest . ( C ) Inadequate labeling density can result in an ambiguous or misleading speckled appearance for structures that are actually continuous ( D ) . JCB • Volume 216 • NumBer 1 • 2017 56 met , contrast ratio imposes limitations on attainable resolution . As sample structure and fluorophore density increase ( when in - creased resolution is most needed ) , so does the probability of multiple fluorophores emitting within a diffraction - limited spot during a single exposure , which can lead to localization errors ( Fig . 3 ) . This interplay between contrast ratio and labeling den - sity is perhaps one of the most critical and overlooked concepts in SMLM ( van de Linde et al . , 2010 ) . Fluorophores do not al - ways exhibit both high - contrast ratio and high - photon yield ; organic dyes tend to be brighter than fluorescent proteins but often possess lower contrast ratios ( Bates et al . , 2008 ; Lippin - cott - Schwartz and Patterson , 2009 ; Dempsey et al . , 2011 ) . Commercially available secondary antibodies usually have many fluorophores per antibody , which reduces contrast ratio ( van de Linde et al . , 2010 ) . Therefore , primary antibodies cus - tom labeled with a mean of approximately one fluorophore are well worth the effort , as they both increase contrast ratio and bring the fluorophore closer to the target of interest . Drift and vibration . Lateral ( xy ) and / or axial ( z ) drift within an imaging system causes the image to move or defocus over time . The magnitude of typical drift relative to resolution limits presents a bigger problem for SRM than for diffrac - tion - limited microscopy . Drift can cause inaccuracy in SRM and introduce artifacts in SIM if it occurs during acquisition of the multiple raw images used for reconstruction . Particularly in SMLM , in which a single image can take tens of minutes to acquire , drift must be measured and corrected by using , for ex - ample , fiducial markers in the sample ( Betzig et al . , 2006 ; Rust et al . , 2006 ) . Fiducial - free drift correction algorithms exist and are included in some commercial SRM software , but their accu - racy depends heavily on image content and sample structure ( Huang et al . , 2008 ; Mlodzianoski et al . , 2011 ; Wang et al . , 2014 ) . Drift correction methods must be tested for accuracy and reproducibility . Vibration in an imaging system can reduce res - olution and SNR by smearing the optical image over more pix - els and can vary in frequency and magnitude over time . SR microscopes should be routinely tested for vibration , and every effort should be made to identify and remove sources ( Petrak and Waters , 2014 ) . Estimating resolution Given the many variables that degrade resolution , only di - rect measurement of the acquired SRM data can provide an estimate of the actual resolution achieved in any given ex - periment . Still , higher reported resolution does not always translate into visibly improved detail in images , even in im - ages of the same structure in comparable samples ( see sup - plement Li et al . , 2015 ) . How can this disconnect be possible ? It may arise from the fact that resolution is a deceptively intricate concept whose characterization cannot be adequately summarized using a sin - gle number ( corresponding to the highest spatial frequency in an image ; Li et al . , 2015 ) . Furthermore , there is no consensus on how best to estimate resolution in SRM images , and SRM developers are in active debate about the relative importance of the various factors that affect resolution ( Li and Betzig , 2016 ; Sahl et al . , 2016 ) . All of the commonly used metrics for esti - mating resolution are , in some way , incomplete descriptors . We encourage researchers to estimate SRM image resolution , but with an eye toward the shortcomings of each approach , using multiple approaches when possible , and with an awareness that resolution is not constant across the FOV . One method commonly used to estimate resolution is to plot the intensity along a line drawn through a filamentous or punctate object in the image . The width of the intensity plot is then taken to represent the resolution achieved across the entire image . However , the specific placement of the line in the image can dramatically affect the estimate ( Fig . 3 ) as a result of local variation in sample structure , labeling density , or background / SNR ( Legant et al . , 2016 ) . With this method , multiple measure - ments must be made on randomly chosen structures across the entire image to reduce bias and take local variations into account . In SMLM , localization precision is often reported but should never be interpreted as an estimate of resolution on its own . Molecular density and localization precision can be combined to calculate a lower bound on attainable resolution Figure 3 . Common problems in SRM images . ( A and B ) SIM reconstruc - tions of a standard slide ( Argolight SIM ) that contain continuous line struc - tures . ( A ) A SIM image reconstructed from high SNR raw images closely matches the expected structures . ( B ) A SIM image reconstructed from low SNR raw images containing artifacts , including the appearance of structures in the background and curved lines and discontinuities , within expected structures ( arrow ) , which were not present in the sample . For display , negative intensity values were set to 0 , and images were auto - scaled . ( C and D ) SMLM images of Alexa Fluor 647 – labeled microtubules created from datasets with lower ( C ) or higher ( D ) numbers of diffrac - tion - limited spots that contain multiple simultaneously emitting fluorophores . The high - density dataset used to create the image in D was simulated by summing the first and second halves of the dataset in C to double the effective number of emitters in each raw image while keeping the total number of emission events constant . Molecules were localized using Thun - derSTO RM ( single - emitter algorithm ; Ovesný et al . , 2014 ) and visualized as normalized Gaussians , with 10 - nm pixel size . The presence of multiple emitters within a diffraction - limited area degrades resolution in areas of the specimen that contain higher fluorophore density , such as areas where structures overlap ( circled areas ) . Notably , this effect is less pronounced in sparse curvilinear objects ( arrows ) ; estimating resolution using a line scan across this microtubule would misrepresent the resolution achieved elsewhere in the image . Superresolution microscopy • lambert and Waters 57 ( Fitzgerald et al . , 2012 ; Legant et al . , 2016 ) , but neither alone is sufficient to fully characterize resolution , and even combined are still an incomplete descriptor as a result of additional factors such as fluorophore - linker size and sample structure ( Nieuwen - huizen et al . , 2013 ; Deschout et al . , 2014 ) . Fourier ring correlation ( FRC ) , commonly used in cryo - electron microscopy , has recently been applied to measure res - olution in SMLM ( Banterle et al . , 2013 ; Nieuwenhuizen et al . , 2013 ) and can easily be applied to any SRM modality . FRC re - quires two images of the same FOV ( varying only in their noise content ) or a set of SMLM localizations from the same FOV randomly divided into two . FRC provides a global estimate of resolution , does not require a priori information , and avoids bias imposed during manual placement of line scans . However , the FRC resolution estimate is heavily sample dependent ; FRC can underestimate microscope performance if the underlying sample structure lacks high spatial frequency information ( see supplement Legant et al . , 2016 ) . Also , FRC applied to SMLM images can yield artificially high estimates if repeated local - izations of individual molecules across multiple frames are not taken into account . Is it real , or artifact ? The promise of SRM is discernment of previously unseen spatial relationships of molecular components in biological specimens . Naturally , the question “is it real ? ” arises in the evaluation of SRM data . It will likely never be possible to have 100 % certainty that SRM images are an accurate representa - tion of the specimen , so it is important not to over - interpret any given feature in a single image . As with all scientific research , SRM data should be repeated over multiple experiments and specimens . Published images should be accompanied by quan - titative measures describing the frequency and variability of observations . Computer - assisted image analysis can be used to reduce bias and statistical models used to calculate confidence intervals of results . We encourage healthy skepticism when viewing SRM data and awareness of the possible artifacts . We classify artifacts as intensity values or localizations in the SRM image that do not correspond to the spatial distribution of flu - orophores in the specimen . Each SRM method is subject to its own potential artifacts . SIM probably receives the most criticism for suscepti - bility to artifacts because of its strict dependence on compu - tational reconstruction algorithms ( Sahl et al . , 2016 ) . Indeed , great care must be taken during SIM system calibration and data acquisition to minimize reconstruction artifacts due to multiple possible sources : low SNR , background , mismatch between ab - errations in raw images and the optical transfer function used for reconstruction , sample motion or photobleaching during acquisition , and illumination pattern inconsistencies across phases and rotations ( Gustafsson et al . , 2008 ; Rego and Shao , 2014 ; Demmerle et al . , 2015 ) . Low SNR or high background can manifest as spurious modulations of intensity ( honeycomb ) at spatial frequencies similar to the illumination pattern ( Fig . 3 ) , and spherical aberration mismatch can lead to axial intensity modulation ( ringing ) or object doubling ( ghosting ) and dips in intensity surrounding bright features . Users should learn to rec - ognize these and other artifacts and modify sample preparations and / or acquisition settings to reduce them ( Ball et al . , 2015 ) . In SMLM , if two fluorophores within a diffraction - limited area fluoresce during a single exposure , algorithms that assume unimolecular emission will erroneously assign a single location somewhere between the two molecules ( Sauer , 2013 ) . In addi - tion to reducing resolution , this can result in artifacts in which neighboring objects appear connected or linear objects appear “webbed” at crossover points ( van de Linde et al . , 2010 ) . Al - though relatively easy to detect in images of sparse curvilinear objects , spurious localizations are difficult to recognize in dense or unknown samples ( Fig . 3 ) . This further underscores the im - portance of using high - contrast ratio fluorophores . Multiemitter algorithms can improve localization precision in images with high emission density ( Holden et al . , 2011 ; Huang et al . , 2011 ) . “Missed” localizations resulting from bleaching , low SNR , and / or the acquisition of too few raw images can also be considered artifactual , as they introduce gaps or breaks not representative of the true fluorophore distribution . A “stopping criterion” for SMLM raw image acquisition could be provided by real - time localization combined with resolution metrics to evaluate when image resolution is no longer limited by localization density ( Wolter et al . , 2012 ; Nieuwenhuizen et al . , 2013 ) . STED does not entail obligatory image processing , so it is often praised as resistant to artifacts . Indeed , STED proba - bly is unlikely to introduce spurious image features . How - ever , STED images often suffer from low SNR and dynamic range , which may result in missed features . Publications using STED often use postacquisition image processing , including smoothing ( which reduces resolution ) or deconvolution ( which has the potential to introduce artifacts ) , to minimize the detri - mental impact of low SNR . ISM methods are also resistant to artifacts resulting from computational reconstruction , and ISM has been shown to be useful in corroborating data acquired with complementary SR methods ( Nixon - Abell et al . , 2016 ; Sivaguru et al . , 2016 ) . Nonetheless , instrument misalignment can lead to image strip - ing in all - optical ISM microscopes ( York et al . , 2013 ) , and deconvolution during pixel reassignment is not immune to arti - facts ( Heintzmann et al . , 2003 ) . In electron microscopy , preservation of ultrastructure by chemical fixation has long been a concern and a challenge . SRM can expose fixation artifacts smaller than the diffraction limit , so sample preparation protocols must be carefully validated ( Halpern et al . , 2015 ; Whelan and Bell , 2015 ) by looking for variation in results with different fixatives , extraction reagents , probe concentrations , and fluorophore - labeling strategies and with controls that distinguish specific from nonspecific labeling . Standards , simulations , and software Optimization of SRM is aided by standards for characteriz - ing instrument performance and methods for assessing image quality . Useful standards include well - characterized biological structures ( such as microtubules ; Vaughan et al . , 2012 ) , nuclear pores ( Löschberger et al . , 2012 ) , clathrin - coated pits ( Bates et al . , 2007 ) , centrioles ( Mennella et al . , 2012 ) or synaptone - mal complexes ( Gustafsson et al . , 2008 ) , DNA - origami rulers ( GAT TAquant ; Schmied et al . , 2012 , 2014 ) , and micropatterned slides ( Argolight ) . Standards help evaluate whether a given SR microscope can achieve theoretical resolution , but they do not guarantee a similar level of performance with all specimens . Open - source software packages that provide metrics of SIM raw data and reconstruction quality ( Ball et al . , 2015 ; K ř í ž ek et al . , 2016 ) are useful for evaluating data reproducibil - ity , as are methods that alert users to potential artifacts ( Förster et al . , 2016 ) . Bayesian reconstruction algorithms yielding es - timates of local uncertainty may help validate specific SRM JCB • Volume 216 • NumBer 1 • 2017 58 image features ( Orieux et al . , 2012 ; Tang et al . , 2016 ) . Com - putational models and simulations have been used to evaluate whether SRM data fit with expectations based on a priori infor - mation ( Rosenbloom et al . , 2014 ; Venkataramani et al . , 2016 ) , to help guide experimental optimization ( Sinkó et al . , 2014 ) , and to serve as benchmarks for the performance of various SRM re - construction methods ( Sage et al . , 2015 ) . Free and open - source SRM reconstruction algorithms are available , some of which may perform better or provide more transparency than software bundled with commercial microscopes ( Deschout et al . , 2014 ; Small and Stahlheber , 2014 ; Sage et al . , 2015 ; K ř í ž ek et al . , 2016 ; Müller et al . , 2016 ) . Multiwavelength imaging Multiwavelength imaging is possible with STED , SMLM , ISM , and SIM . Two - color STED ( Meyer et al . , 2008 ) is common , and three - color STED has been demonstrated ( Sidenstein et al . , 2016 ) . However , the ability to acquire multiple channels depends on the available STED depletion laser , and the selec - tion of fluorophores optimized for efficient STED depletion ( Wurm et al . , 2012 ; Kolmakov et al . , 2014 ) rapidly dwindles as the number of desired channels increases . Multiplexing in SMLM has taken many forms , including spectrally resolved ac - tivation and reporter dyes ( Bates et al . , 2007 ; van de Linde et al . , 2009 ) , photoswitchable proteins ( Shroff et al . , 2007 ) , and sequential labeling approaches ( Jungmann et al . , 2014 ; Tam et al . , 2014 ) . No two dyes have the same brightness and contrast ratio , so SMLM resolution will generally be highest in only one channel when using multiple spectral emitters ( Dempsey et al . , 2011 ; Nahidiazar et al . , 2016 ) . In sequential labeling tech - niques such as Exchange - PAI NT ( Jungmann et al . , 2014 ) , buf - fer exchanges make drift correction critical ( Dai et al . , 2016 ) . Multicolor SIM and ISM are compatible with many commonly used fluorophores , provided they are among the most bright and photostable , but resolution and SIM reconstruction quality will vary with wavelength . Aberrations are wavelength depen - dent ( Fig . 1 ) , and achieving optimal results across all channels in any SRM modality becomes more difficult with increas - ing spectral separation . For meaningful comparisons to be made across channels , images of different wavelengths must be in perfect lateral and axial registration . Registration shifts can be introduced by chro - matic aberration , by fluorescence filters that are not perfectly flat , and when multiple cameras or image - splitting devices are used . Registration errors are present to some extent in all mi - croscopes , and registration shifts that are insignificant in dif - fraction - limited microscopy may be problematic in SRM . All multichannel SRM publications should report methodology and validation of channel registration . As with any fluorescence technique , controls and correc - tions for bleed - through , cross talk , and autofluorescence are critical ( Bolte and Cordelières , 2006 ) . To appreciate the im - portance of these controls on reproducibility , see Vogel ( 2015 ) . Although conventional controls are often applicable to methods like SIM , ISM , and STED , the various SMLM multiplexing approaches require different considerations , and users should familiarize themselves with the corrections required for their specific approach ( for examples , see Dani et al . , 2010 ; Bates et al . , 2012 ; Kim et al . , 2013 ) . To measure colocalization using SRM , it is essential to un - derstand the nature of information provided by the method . SIM , ISM , and STED images report fluorescence intensity values , so existing colocalization analysis methods based on overlap or intensity value correlations may often be used ( Manders et al . , 1993 ; Bolte and Cordelières , 2006 ) . SMLM “images” do not report fluorescence intensity but are rather scatter plots of fluorophore localizations ; researchers must be careful to avoid misinterpretation of SMLM data ( Durisic et al . , 2014 ) . Many common image analysis methods are inapplicable to SMLM . Instead , methods that analyze localization clustering , for exam - ple , can be used to understand the distribution of one fluorophore relative to another ( Barna et al . , 2016 ; Pageon et al . , 2016 ) . 3D imaging Although 3D SRM can attain higher axial resolution than dif - fraction - limited microscopy , its application is far more limited and requires compromises in imaging speed , SNR , light dose , and / or lateral resolution . Increased axial resolution in STED typically comes at the expense of lateral resolution ( Klar et al . , 2000 ) . 3D SIM requires acquisition of additional images compared with 2D SIM , decreasing speed , and increasing il - lumination light dose . 3D SMLM methods use various PSF engineering approaches to encode depth information into 2D images ( Huang et al . , 2008 ; Juette et al . , 2008 ; Pavani et al . , 2009 ; Hajj et al . , 2014 ) ; each approach comes with its own compromise in either lateral localization precision , axial range , or speed ( Badieirostami et al . , 2010 ) . Increased axial resolution also demands increased labeling density ; 20 - nm resolution in three dimensions would require a minimum density of ∼ 37 , 000 fluorophores within a 3D diffraction - limited volume ( Legant et al . , 2016 ) . Because of increased complexity , it is prudent to rule out the sufficiency of 2D methods before moving to 3D . There are inherent limitations to imaging deep into bi - ological specimens . Biological samples have heterogeneous refractive indices and scatter and absorb light , resulting in in - creased aberrations and decreased SNR with distance from the coverslip ( Egner and Hell , 2006 ) . SRM is not immune to these effects and is instead particularly sensitive to aberrations and low SNR . The limitations of how deep into a sample SR can be achieved vary with different types of samples . The detec - tion and precise localization of single molecules required for SMLM are often limited to less than a single cell layer . Thicker specimens typically also suffer from increased out - of - focus flu - orescence , which degrades the quality of SIM reconstructions . The SIM illumination pattern degrades with distance from the coverslip , limiting even samples with minimal out - of - focus flu - orescence to depths on the order of < 20 µm . For SRM imaging of thick specimens , thin sectioning or clearing methods may be required ( Ke et al . , 2016 ) . Pinhole - based ISM methods and STED may improve contrast in thick tissues by rejecting out - of - focus fluorescence , but both are limited by light scattering with increased depth into the sample . STED has been implemented using two - photon excitation ( Takasaki et al . , 2013 ) and has also been used for in situ mammalian imaging ( Berning et al . , 2012 ) . Live imaging Live - cell imaging demands deliberate navigation of the intrinsic trade - offs between spatial resolution , acquisition speed , experi - ment duration , and phototoxicity . Increases in spatial resolution must “borrow” from these other parameters , and we encourage readers to be mindful of these compromises when planning or evaluating live - cell SRM experiments . Phototoxicity . Most of the cell types we image never experience a single photon in vivo . The possible effects of Superresolution microscopy • lambert and Waters 59 phototoxicity on the biological process being studied must be considered and controlled for in any live - cell imaging experi - ment ( Waters , 2007 ) ; failure to do so will almost certainly de - crease the reproducibility of results . SRM must use higher illumination intensities than diffraction - limited microscopy to reach the same SNR because SRM requires that photons are collected from a smaller area of the sample and / or are distrib - uted over more pixels ( Betzig , 2015 ) . Published SRM studies of live specimens report peak illumination intensities as high as ∼ 5 billion times ( ∼ 500 MW / cm 2 for STED ; Lauterbach et al . , 2010 ) , ∼ 50 million times ( ∼ 5 kW / cm 2 for SMLM ; Huang et al . , 2013 ) , and ∼ 100 times ( ∼ 10 W / cm 2 for SIM ; Kner et al . , 2009 ) greater than the peak solar irradiance on earth ( ∼ 0 . 1 W / cm 2 ) . These numbers cannot be directly compared ( with one another or with diffraction - limited microscopy ) be - cause the duration of illumination and the number of raw im - ages required to generate a single SRM image vary . Regardless , the light doses used in SRM have been demonstrated to have detrimental effects and change the biological behavior of cells ( Wäldchen et al . , 2015 ) . With regard to phototoxicity , Li et al . ( 2015 ) suggest that “it is prudent to start with less invasive , lower resolution methods” and move incrementally to higher resolution methods only as needed . “Fast” live - cell SRM . Speed of image acquisition de - termines how accurately dynamics can be reconstructed from time - lapsed videos . Words like “fast” are used to describe some SRM modalities ; this is always relative to other types of SRM and not relative to diffraction - limited microscopy , which can always acquire images faster than SRM given the same sample . Most SMLM applications require thousands to tens of thou - sands of images to generate a single SR image at the highest resolution . Effective acquisition rates > 30 Hz have been achieved with a 169 - µm 2 FOV ( Huang et al . , 2013 ) , but with an obligatory trade - off between spatial resolution and acquisition speed ( Shroff et al . , 2008 ) . Single point – scanning ISM methods ( e . g . , Airyscan ) and STED are capable of frame rates > 10 – 20 Hz , but point - scanning imparts trade - offs between acquisition speed , FOV , SNR , and illumination dose . Publications should be examined carefully for compromises made to achieve fast acquisition , as they are not always explicitly stated . The modest resolution gain offered by SIM is , in a sense , its greatest strength with regard to live - cell imaging . As a wide - field technique requiring 9 ( 2D ) to 15 ( 3D ) images per plane , some SIM implementations can acquire FOVs > 1 , 000 µm 2 , at > 10 frames / s , for hundreds or even thousands of time points using light doses ≤ 10 W / cm 2 ( Kner et al . , 2009 ; Li et al . , 2015 ; Nixon - Abell et al . , 2016 ) , with the primary limitation being fluorophore brightness and detector speed . Parallelized ISM methods ( e . g . , instant SIM ) can achieve frame rates as high as 100 Hz while maintaining illumination intensities ≤ 50 W / cm 2 and large FOV ( York et al . , 2013 ) at resolutions only slightly below conventional SIM . Do you need SRM ? SRM has been pivotal in several biological discoveries , includ - ing determination of the structure of nuclear pores ( Szymborska et al . , 2013 ) , the multimolecular arrangement of the nuclear periphery ( Schermelleh et al . , 2008 ) , the stratification of focal adhesions ( Kanchanawong et al . , 2010 ) , and chromatin struc - ture across epigenetic states ( Boettiger et al . , 2016 ) . We have seen our core facility users obtain results with SRM that would not have been possible with diffraction - limited techniques . However , SRM is currently ( for lack of a better word ) trendy , and the perception exists that inclusion of an SRM figure in - creases the likelihood of publication of a research study . We encourage researchers to use SRM only when it is the best tool for the question at hand . The complexity and compromises in SRM make diffraction - limited microscopy preferable wherever appropriate . Even when imaging structures smaller than the dif - fraction limit , SRM is not necessarily the best choice . Before turning to SRM , it is important to differentiate between the need for increased resolution and the need for sensitivity , contrast , and / or quantitative image analysis . Or do you need sensitivity ? Detection of objects reveals their presence , whereas resolution allows closely spaced objects to be distinguished as separate from one another in the image . Sensitivity is required to detect features in the specimen that emit fewer photons . Diffraction - limited microscopes can be used very effectively for applications that require the highest possible sensitivity ; they are , for example , routinely used for single - molecule imaging . SRM methods are not inherently more sensitive than diffraction - limited microscopy and are far less sensitive in some applications . If you are struggling to de - tect fluorescence in your sample , focus your efforts on increas - ing the sensitivity of your diffraction - limited microscope ( Murray et al . , 2007 ; Waters , 2009 ) . SRM is most appropriate when the features of interest are detectable with diffrac - tion - limited microscopy but are too densely distributed to be resolved . Structures that appear only in SRM images may be artifacts or the result of a poorly performing diffrac - tion - limited microscope . Or do you need contrast ? SRM methods often re - sult in high - contrast images as a result of either rejection of out - of - focus fluorescence ( STED and ISM ) , postacquisition processing ( SIM and ISM ) , or display ( SMLM ) . Contrast is vi - sually appealing but different from resolution . Out - of - focus flu - orescence , autofluorescence , excess fluorophores , or excitation light leaking through filter sets can all reduce contrast and should be addressed directly . Optical sectioning techniques such as confocal , HILO , TIRF , and light sheet can dramatically decrease out - of - focus fluorescence in diffraction - limited im - ages ( Axelrod , 2001 ; Conchello and Lichtman , 2005 ; Tokunaga et al . , 2008 ; Weber et al . , 2014 ) . When SRM images are dis - played next to hazy diffraction - limited images and the scale bar reveals that the “now - resolved” structures are separated by more than the diffraction limit , it was likely contrast—not reso - lution—that was originally lacking . Or do you need image analysis ? The human brain is exquisitely tuned to visual information . The phrase “seeing is believing” reflects the emphasis placed on qualitatively demon - strating a particular concept with images . However , comput - er - assisted quantitative analysis can reveal information that cannot be seen by eye . Using diffraction - limited images , pre - cise measurements can be made of distances and phenomena that occur far below the diffraction limit ( Verdaasdonk et al . , 2014 ) with higher temporal resolution and far lower light doses than any SRM method . Gaussian fitting can be used to track the movement of isolated diffraction - limited objects with nanome - ter precision ( Gelles et al . , 1988 ; Yildiz et al . , 2003 ) . Spectral ( Lacoste et al . , 2000 ) and temporal ( Gordon et al . , 2004 ; Qu et al . , 2004 ) information can also be exploited to discriminate ob - jects spaced well below the diffraction limit . For example , using diffraction - limited microscopy with image analysis , Church - man et al . ( 2005 ) measured distances between two different JCB • Volume 216 • NumBer 1 • 2017 60 fluorophores bound to the same myosin V macromolecule , and Joglekar et al . ( 2006 ) determined the relative positions of eight kinetochore multiprotein complexes with 10 - nm resolution . Sometimes , a change in labeling strategy can reveal new infor - mation : sparse fluorescent labeling ( fluorescent speckle micros - copy ) has been used to quantify otherwise unresolvable cytoskeletal dynamics with statistical power that would have been impossible with SRM ( Danuser and Waterman - Storer , 2006 ) . Counting the number of molecules / objects in a sample does not always require resolving individual molecules / objects . Accurate counting has been achieved through quantitative image analysis of fluorescence intensities using diffraction - limited microscopy ( Wu and Pollard , 2005 ; Joglekar et al . , 2006 ; Lu et al . , 2015 ) . Summary Careful attention must be paid to sample preparation methods , image acquisition parameters , correction for aberrations , and the possibility of artifacts to ensure accurate and reproducible SRM results . SR microscopes should be routinely characterized and optimized using standard test samples to ensure they are performing as expected . Computational image analysis and / or simulations should be used to validate SRM results . While un - doubtedly an impressive set of technologies , SRM is also more difficult and in every way except resolution more limited than diffraction - limited microscopy , so SRM should be preferred only when diffraction - limited methods will not suffice . With the same rigorous attention to detail demonstrated by SRM de - velopers , we expect biologists will continue to leverage SRM to make exciting advances in our understanding of cellular and molecular structure and function .
